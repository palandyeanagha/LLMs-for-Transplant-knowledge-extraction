Abstract
Background: Acute liver failure (ALF) is a life-threatening disease with a high mortality rate. However, there are
limited treatments or devices available for ALF therapy. Here, we aimed to develop a new strategy for ALF
treatment by transplanting functional liver organoids (LOs) generated from single donor-derived human induced
pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) endoderm, endothelial cells (ECs), and mesenchymal cells (MCs).
Methods: First, we isolated ECs and MCs from a single donor umbilical cord (UC) through enzyme digestion and
characterized the UC-ECs and UC-MCs by flow cytometry. Second, using a nonviral reprogramming method, we
generated same donor-derived hiPSCs from the UC-ECs and investigated their hepatic differentiation abilities.
Finally, we simultaneously plated EC-hiPSC endoderm, UC-ECs, and UC-MCs in a three-dimensional (3D) microwell
culture system, and generated single donor cell-derived differentiated LOs for ALF mouse treatment.
Results: We obtained ECs and MCs from a single donor UC with high purity, and these cells provided a multicellular
microenvironment that promoted LO differentiation. hiPSCs from the same donor were generated from UC-ECs, and
the resultant EC-hiPSCs could be differentiated efficiently into pure definitive endoderm and further into hepatic
lineages. Simultaneous plating of EC-hiPSC endoderm, UC-ECs, and UC-MCs in the 3D microwell system generated
single donor cell-derived LOs (SDC-LOs) that could be differentiated into functional LOs with enhanced hepatic
capacity as compared to that of EC-hiPSC-derived hepatic-like cells. When these functional SDC-LOs were transplanted
into the renal subcapsules of ALF mice, they rapidly assumed hepatic functions and improved the survival rate of
ALF mice.
Conclusion: These results demonstrate that functional LOs generated from single donor cells can improve the
condition of ALF mice. Functional SDC-LO transplantation provides a promising novel approach for ALF therapy.

Background
Acute liver failure (ALF) is a rare but life-threatening
illness that is mainly caused by viral infection and drug￾induced liver injury [1]. The clinical presentation of ALF
initially includes hepatic dysfunction, abnormal liver
biochemical values, and coagulopathy, followed by the
development of encephalopathy with multiple organ
failure resulting in mortality in 80–85% of cases [1]. Al￾though various treatments are administered to prevent
disease progression in these patients, the preferred op￾tion is liver transplantation, which has 1-year and 5-year
survival rates of 79% and 72%, respectively [2]. How￾ever, transplantation is not universally available (performed
in < 10% of patients with ALF [2, 3]), and an increased risk
of death is associated with transplantation with infected,
older, or partial grafts or grafts from donors without
matching human leukocyte antigen (HLA) [2, 4].
As an alternative to liver transplantation, primary
human hepatocyte (PHH) transplantation has been per￾formed in patients with liver-based metabolic disease
and ALF, and in neonates and children with metabolic
disorders [5]. However, this treatment is also limited by

donor shortage [6]. This shortage in PHHs might be
resolved with the emergence of human induced pluripo￾tent stem cells (hiPSCs), which could provide an
unlimited source of hepatic-like cells (HLCs) [7, 8].
hiPSC-HLCs have been used for engraftment in a liver
injury model and to repair injured liver tissue [9];
however, following engraftment, it took weeks for
hiPSC-HLCs to start producing detectable levels of spe￾cific proteins and exhibit hepatic function [10]. Because
of the rapid deterioration of liver function and extensive
toxic substance accumulation [1], the treatment window
for ALF patients is very narrow, and the extended time
period needed for engraftment with hiPSC-HLCs might
not be suitable for ALF therapy. Therefore, transplants
that can assume hepatic functions with little delay are
required for ALF treatment.
Transplantation of in vitro-generated organoids can
regenerate functional tissue in vivo and might be a po￾tential approach for ALF treatment [11]. Previous stud￾ies have developed a macro-liver organoid (macro-LO)
from hiPSCs with endothelial cells (ECs) and mesenchy￾mal cells (MCs) that can grow into vascularized,
functional tissue post transplantation by recapitulating
events that occur in early liver organogenesis [12, 13].
However, the three types of cells necessary for LO gener￾ation were derived from three different donors with dif￾ferent HLA types, and thus would not match any
particular patient’s HLA for clinical application. Clinical
liver transplantation studies have found that incompat￾ible HLA matching between the graft and the patient is
associated with increased mortality and graft loss in ALF
patient therapy [2]; therefore, LOs derived from a single
donor cell should be developed to match specific
patients’ HLAs. Single donor-derived cells have the same
host genetic background and thus may recapitulate liver
organogenesis more accurately to support LO differenti￾ation. Additionally, the LOs reported previously were
still at an immature stage, and they required 2 weeks to
differentiate and exhibit hepatic function with human￾specific albumin (ALB) production in vivo [12]. How￾ever, for ALF therapy, transplants that can immediately
exhibit hepatic function in vivo are urgently needed [14],
and functional LOs are thus considered to hold promise.
Therefore, functional LOs generated from single donor
cells are expected to be useful for ALF therapy.
To generate functional single donor cell-derived
(SDC)-LOs for clinical application, all three types of cells
(hiPSC-endoderm, ECs, and MCs) should be obtained
from the same donor with high purity and few genomic
mutations. Human somatic cells accumulate nuclear and
mitochondrial genomic mutations over the course of
their lifespan [15]; thus, cells obtained from newborns
would be expected to have fewer mutations than adult
cells. ECs and MCs that have been used for LO
generation are derived from newborn umbilical cords
(UCs) and adult bone marrow (BM), respectively [12, 13].
The isolation of MCs from newborn BM requires an inva￾sive procedure that would cause harm to the newborn, so
a replacement MC source from the same newborn is thus
necessary for SDC-LO generation. The newborn UC is an
immature tissue with a large number of MCs that can be
isolated without invasive procedures [16], and UC-derived
MCs have characteristics similar to those of BM￾derived MCs (BM-MCs) [16]. Therefore, ECs and MCs
derived from the same UC might be useful for generating
functional SDC-LOs with the same donor-derived hiPSCs.
In this study, we obtained ECs and MCs from a single
donor UC and investigated the role of single donor￾derived ECs and MCs in LO generation and differenti￾ation. We also generated hiPSCs from the same donor
to provide a hiPSC-endoderm source for LO generation.
Using these three types of cells, we generated functional
SDC-LOs for ALF therapy.
Methods
EC and MC isolation and culture
Under the permission of the Ethical Review Board of
Yokohama City University, human UCs were obtained
from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology,
Yokohama City University Hospital from full-term cae￾sarian section births after obtaining informed consent
from the mother. ECs and MCs were collected from the
same UC. The collection procedure was in accordance
with the ethical standards of the local ethics committee.
To isolate ECs [17], the cord was laid out on a clean
disk; the cord vein was washed three times with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and filled with 10 ml
collagenase (1 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA). After clamping of the open end, the cord was
incubated in RPMI 1640 medium at 37 °C for 15 min.
The vein was washed with RPMI 1640 medium, the
wash medium was collected and centrifuged at 200 × g
for 5 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 10 ml EC
growth medium (EGM; Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA)
and seeded in a 10-cm 0.1% gelatin-coated dish. For MC
isolation, the vein and arteries were removed from the
cord after isolation of ECs, and the cord was cut into
pieces 1–2 mm3 that were incubated in an enzyme cock￾tail that included 2500 U/ml collagenase (Gibco, Grand
Island, NY, USA), 5 mg/ml hyaluronidase (Wako Pure
Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan), and 2 U/ml dispase
(Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA) for 4 h with
light shaking at 37 °C. After incubation, the sample was
centrifuged at 400 × g for 10 min; the pellet was washed
once with RPMI 1640 and resuspended in 10 ml mesen￾chymal stem cell growth medium (MSCGM; Lonza), and
cells were seeded in a 10-cm tissue culture dish. ECs
and BM-derived mesenchymal stem cells were obtained
Nie et al. Stem Cell Research & Therapy (2018) 9:5 Page 2 of 12

from Lonza as control ECs (con-ECs) and MCs
(con-MCs) and maintained in EGM and MSCGM,
respectively. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a
humidified incubator with 5% CO2.
Generation of nonviral feeder-free hiPSCs from
UC-derived ECs
Feeder-free hiPSCs were reprogrammed from ECs using
a protocol reported previously [18], with minor modifi￾cations. Briefly, ECs were transfected with episomal iPSC
reprogramming vectors (pCXLE-hOCT3/4-shp53-F,
pCXLE-hSK, pCXLE-hUL, and pCXWB-EBNA1) using
Nucleofector 4D and then cultured in a plate coated
with growth factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences,
Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) in mTeSR medium (Stem Cell
Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada). When the size of
hiPSC colonies exceeded 1 mm, the colonies were
picked and cultured in a plate coated with growth
factor-reduced Matrigel in mTeSR medium to establish
individual hiPSC lines. The TkDA3 human iPSC clone
used in this study was provided by K. Eto and H.
Nakauchi, University of Tokyo. Undifferentiated iPSCs
were maintained in mTeSR1 medium on a dish coated
with growth factor-reduced Matrigel. All cells were main￾tained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2.
Hepatic lineage differentiation and LO differentiation
HLCs were differentiated from hiPSCs according to a
published protocol [7], with minor modifications.
To generate hiPSC-LOs, hiPSC endoderm cells
(250,000 cells), con-ECs (175,000 cells), and con-MCs
(25,000 cells) or UC-derived ECs (UC-EC) (175,000 cells)
and MCs (UC-MC) (25,000 cells) were cocultured in
serum-free differentiation (SFD) medium containing
epidermal growth factor (EGF, 10 ng/ml; Sigma￾Aldrich), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF,
10 ng/ml; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), basic
fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, 10 ng/ml; Wako Pure
Chemical Industries), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF,
20 ng/ml; Sigma-Aldrich), and dexamethasone (100
nM; Sigma-Aldrich) in a three-dimensional (3D) micro￾well plate (Kuraray, Tokyo, Japan). The SFD medium
contained 375 ml Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium
(Life Technologies), 125 ml Ham’s F-12 K medium
(Life Technologies), 5 ml B27 supplement (Life
Technologies), 2.5 ml N2 supplement (Life Technologies),
0.05% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich), 2 mM
L-glutamine (Life Technologies), 1% penicillin–strepto￾mycin (Life Technologies), 0.45 mM monothioglycerol
solution (Wako Pure Chemical Industries), and
0.5 mM L-ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich). The hepatic
lineage cells and LOs were differentiated and
maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with
5% CO2.
Macro-LO generation
Macro-LOs were generated from hiPSCs as described
previously with minor modifications [19]. To generate
macro-LOs, hiPSC endoderm (500,000 cells), con-ECs
(350,000 cells), and con-MCs (50,000 cells) or UC-ECs
(350,000 cells) and UC-MCs (50,000 cells) were resus￾pended in SFD medium containing EGF (10 ng/ml),
VEGF (10 ng/ml), bFGF (10 ng/ml), HGF (20 ng/ml),
and dexamethasone (100 nM) and were plated on preso￾lidified growth factor-reduced Matrigel diluted with SFD
medium (100 μl Matrigel + 100 μl SFD medium, incu￾bated at 37 °C for at least 30 min to solidify) in a 48-well
plate. Images of macro-LOs were taken at 0, 3, 12, 24,
48, and 72 h during formation. The macro-LO area and
culture well area at each time point were quantified
using ImageJ software (WS Rasband, ImageJ; NIH,
Bethesda, MD, USA) and the following equation:
Percent area of LO = (LO area) / (Culture well area) ×
100%.
The generated macro-LOs were cultured at 37 °C in a
humidified incubator with 5% CO2.
Primary human hepatocyte culture
The dish-plated freshly isolated PHHs from humanized
mice were purchased from PhoenixBio Co., Ltd
(Higashihiroshima, Japan), without cryopreservation.
The PHHs were cultured in hepatic growth medium
(PhoenixBio). After 24 h of culture, PHHs were used for
ALB and urea production analysis.
Transplantation of SDC-LOs into ALF mice
Alb-TRECK/SCID mice were a gift from the Tokyo
Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science. The mice
were bred and maintained according to the Yokohama
City University institutional guidelines for the use of
laboratory animals. All experimental procedures were
approved by the institutional review board of the Animal
Research Center, Yokohama City University School of
Medicine (No. 075). The ALF model was generated as
reported previously [20]. Briefly, 8–10-week-old mice
were administered 1.5 μg/kg diphtheria toxin (DT) by
intraperitoneal injection; 48 h later, serum alanine ami￾notransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase
(AST) were detected using DRI-CHEM (Fujifilm, Tokyo,
Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In
vitro-generated and differentiated SDC-LOs (~1 × 106
hepatocytes) were collected and transplanted into the
renal subcapsular space of each ALF mouse. The sham
group received 50 μl of sterile saline.
RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and quantitative
polymerase chain reaction
Total RNA was isolated using a PureLink viral RNA
mini kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,
Nie et al. Stem Cell Research & Therapy (2018) 9:5 Page 3 of 12

USA). Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from RNA
(1 μg) using a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription
kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions and was used for quantita￾tive polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with the specific
primers and universal probe library probes presented in
Additional file 1: Table S1. Target gene expression levels
were calculated by the ΔΔCT method, with β-ACTIN
serving as an internal control for normalization.
Flow cytometry
Cells were labeled with antibodies against cluster of
differentiation (CD)31, CD146, CD144, CD90, CD45,
CD73, CD105, HLA-DR, SSEA4, and TRA-1-60 (BD
Biosciences) and analyzed by flow cytometry on a MoFlo
Astrios system (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA).
ALB assay, cytochrome P450 3A4 assay, urea assay, and
cell normalization
Human ALB levels were measured by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a kit (Bethyl
Laboratories, Montgomery, TX, USA). Urea production
was evaluated using a QuantiChrom urea assay kit
(BioAssay Systems, Hayward, CA, USA), and cyto￾chrome P450 (CYP)3A4 activity was detected using a
P450-Glo CYP3A4 assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The total cell numbers in hiPSC-HLCs and hiPSC-LOs
were normalized according to DNA amount. To calcu￾late the cell number in LOs, we first counted the num￾ber of hiPSC-HLCs using an IN Cell Analyzer 2000 (GE
Healthcare, Cardiff, UK) with Hoechst 33342 staining.
Second, total DNA of hiPSC-LOs and hiPSC-HLCs was
extracted using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany), and DNA was eluted in 50 μl of elusion
buffer. Third, DNA concentration was determined using a
nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fischer Scientific,
Waltham, MA, USA). The total cell number in hiPSC￾LOs was calculated using the following equation:
hiPSC‐LO cell number ¼ ð Þ HLC cell number ð Þ LO DNA amount
ð Þ HLC DNA amount
ALB secretion, urea production, and CYP3A4 activity
were also normalized to the calculated total cell number.
Periodic acid–Schiff staining and indocyanine green
uptake and release
Glycogen was detected with the periodic acid–Schiff
(PAS) staining kit (Muto Pure Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were
washed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for
15 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS,
the cells were oxidized in 0.5% periodic acid solution for
7 min, then washed with PBS and incubated in Schiff
reagent for 15 min. After three rounds of incubation for
2 min each in sulfurous acid water, the cells were
washed with PBS and visualized by microscopy.
Dry indocyanine green (ICG) powder (Akorn, Buffalo
Grove, IL, USA) (10 mg) was dissolved in 10 ml of hep￾atocyte culture medium (Lonza) to obtain a 1 mg/ml
stock solution. The cells were cultured in ICG medium
for 4 h at 37 °C, washed three times with PBS, and incu￾bated in fresh medium for 4 h to determine ICG release.
Immunohistochemistry
SDC-LOs and kidney tissue transplanted with SDC-LOs
were embedded in optimal cutting temperature com￾pound (Sakura Finetek, Tokyo, Japan), and 7-μm sec￾tions were cut and mounted on MAS-GP type A-coated
slides (Matsunami, Osaka, Japan). Tissue sections and
cultured cells were fixed in a 4% paraformaldehyde solu￾tion in PBS for 10 min, washed three times with PBS,
and blocked for 60 min with 10% enhanced chemilumin￾escence prime blocking agent in PBS containing 0.3%
Triton X-100, followed by three washes with PBS. Sam￾ples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies
against human ALB (Bethyl Laboratories), Hepatic nu￾clear factor (HNF)4A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA, USA) and α1-antitrypsin (A1AT) (Wako) in
blocking buffer, washed three times with PBS, and
incubated with a fluorophore-conjugated secondary anti￾body for 60 min at room temperature. The samples were
washed three times in PBS and covered with mounting
medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Fluor￾escence was detected on an Axio Imager M1 microscope
(Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as the mean ± standard error. The
means of two groups were compared by the Mann–
Whitney U test or unpaired t test. P < 0.05 was consid￾ered to indicate statistically significant differences. Data
were obtained from at least three independent biological
replicates, and analyses were performed with GraphPad
Prism software (San Diego, CA, USA).
Results
Single donor-derived UC-ECs and UC-MCs promote
hiPSC-LO differentiation
To generate SDC-LOs for ALF therapy, we first isolated
UC-ECs and UC-MCs from a single UC by digestion
with an enzyme or an enzyme cocktail (Additional file 2:
Figure S1A, B). UC-ECs demonstrated the same capacity
as con-ECs for vascular network formation and the same
proliferation rate (Additional file 2: Figure S1C, D). Flow
cytometry analysis revealed that UC-ECs and con-ECs
displayed similar surface markers: CD31+
, CD144+
,
CD146+
, CD90−
, CD45−
, and SSEA4−
. However, the
Nie et al. Stem Cell Research & Therapy (2018) 9:5 Page 4 of 12

purity of UC-ECs was much higher than that of con-ECs
(Additional file 2: Figure S1F). Moreover, we also ana￾lyzed and compared the characteristics of UC-MCs and
con-MCs. The proliferation assay showed that UC-MCs
had a higher proliferative capacity than con-MCs
(Additional file 2: Figure S1E). Flow cytometry analysis
revealed that UC-MCs and con-MCs were positive for
CD90, CD73, and CD105, and negative for CD31, CD45,
and HLA-DR. The purity of UC-MCs was also higher
than that of con-MCs (Additional file 2: Figure S1G).
ECs and MCs have demonstrated the capacity to drive
self-organization of hiPSC-endoderm into macro-LOs
on a soft matrix [11, 12]. To investigate whether single
donor-derived UC-ECs and UC-MCs could also drive
this process, these cells along with hiPSC-endoderm
were plated on the same soft matrix (Fig. 1a). We found
that single donor-derived UC-ECs and UC-MCs (donor
UC-EC/MC) could promote hiPSC-endoderm to spon￾taneously organize into 3D macro-LOs with a contrac￾tion speed equal to that of macro-LOs derived from

con-ECs and con-MCs (con-EC/MC) used in previous
studies (Fig. 1a, b) [11, 12].
The diameters of the self-organized macro-LOs were
approximately 2 mm, and this size impeded their further
differentiation in vitro. To promote LO differentiation
and generate functional transplants, we used a 3D
microwell culture system to generate small LOs by re￾creating the interactions among endoderm, con-ECs,
and con-MCs (con-EC/MC LOs) (Fig. 1c). After 24 h,
the three types of cells organized into con-EC/MC LOs
with a small and uniform size (205.1 ± 37.5 μm, n = 532).
After 15 days of differentiation, con-EC/MC LOs
smoothly differentiated into functional LOs and dis￾played higher ALB production and hepatic gene expres￾sion than ΔEC/MC LOs (deletion of ECs/MCs during
LO generation) (Fig. 1d, e). This result indicates that the
microenvironment provided by ECs and MCs promotes
hepatic lineage differentiation in LOs. To investigate
whether single donor-derived UC-ECs and UC-MCs also
have the same roles in LO generation and differentiation,
hiPSC-endoderm, UC-ECs, and UC-MCs were plated in
the same culture system. Consistent with the results for
con-EC/MC LOs, donor UC-EC/MC LOs with a small
and uniform size (204.1 ± 35.5 μm, n = 527) were gener￾ated after 24 h of culture (Fig. 1c). Furthermore, ELISA
analysis revealed that ALB production of UC-EC/MC
LOs was equal to that of con-EC/MC LOs after 15 days
of differentiation and significantly higher than that of
ΔEC/MC LOs (Fig. 1d). qPCR analysis further confirmed
that UC-EC/MC LOs displayed the same expression
levels of the hepatic genes ALB, CYP3A4, glucose-6-
phosphatase catalytic subunit (G6PC), and tryptophan
2,3-dioxygenase 2 (TDO2) as con-EC/MC LOs (Fig. 1e).
These results indicate that single donor-derived UC-ECs
and UC-MCs can promote LO differentiation as effect￾ively as con-ECs and con-MCs and that single donor￾derived UC-ECs and UC-MCs are promising cell sources
for SDC-LO generation.
Single donor-derived hiPSCs reprogrammed from UC-ECs
In addition to the single donor-derived ECs and MCs,
same donor-derived hiPSCs are also an indispensable
component for SDC-LO generation. Human iPSCs have
been reprogrammed successfully from different types of
donor somatic cells, including fibroblasts, UC blood
cells, and ECs [21]. The characteristics of UC-ECs, in￾cluding their ease of collection from newborn tissue, few
mutations, high efficiency of isolation and proliferation,
and capacity for rapid reprogramming, make them an
attractive somatic cell source for therapeutic-grade
hiPSC generation [22, 23]. We transfected episomal
hiPSC reprogramming vectors into UC-ECs using a
method reported previously [18] to reprogram UC-ECs
into hiPSCs (EC-hiPSCs) that exhibited morphologies
typical of embryonic stem cells (Fig. 2a). The EC-hiPSCs
were positive for nuclear expression of the embryonic
stem cell markers OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2 (Fig. 2b).
Furthermore, flow cytometry demonstrated that repro￾grammed EC-hiPSCs had lost the expression of the endo￾thelial marker CD31 while expressing typical hiPSC surface
markers such as SSEA4 and TRA-1-60 (Additional file 3:
Figure S2A). qPCR analysis further revealed that EC￾hiPSCs expressed pluripotency-related genes such as
OCT4, NANOG, LIN28A, SOX2, and KLF4 at higher levels,
exhibiting the downregulation of endothelial markers such
as CD31, TIE1, ERG, and vWF compared to levels in the
original UC-ECs (Additional file 3: Figure S2B).
Effective differentiation of endoderm and hepatic
lineages from single donor-derived EC-hiPSCs
To generate functional SDC-LOs, EC-hiPSCs should be
able to differentiate into endoderm and hepatic lineages.
We used a protocol reported previously to investigate hep￾atic lineage differentiation from these EC-hiPSCs (Fig. 2c)
[7]. In endodermal differentiation medium, EC-hiPSCs
showed rapid downregulation of the pluripotency genes
OCT4 and NANOG and upregulation of the endoderm￾related genes CER1 and CXCR4 (Fig. 2c, d). Flow cytome￾try showed that the EC-hiPSC-endoderm was a highly pure
population with 99.05 ± 0.26% CXCR4+
EpCAM+ cells and
99.72 ± 0.10% CXCR4+
C-KIT+ cells (Fig. 2e). Next, the
endoderm culture medium was replaced with hepatic
lineage differentiation medium as in Fig. 2c. EC-hiPSC￾endoderm gradually differentiated into immature HLCs
with high AFP and low ALB expression (Fig. 2c, d) and
later matured into ALB-expressing HLCs (Fig. 2c, d). Im￾munocytochemical analysis showed that EC-hiPSC-derived
HLCs were positive for ALB, HNF4A, and A1AT (Fig. 2f ).
Glycogen storage in these HLCs was demonstrated by PAS
staining (Fig. 2g), and the capacity for ICG uptake and re￾lease was also confirmed (Fig. 2g). These results suggest
that the single donor-derived EC-hiPSCs can be differenti￾ated effectively into endoderm and hepatic cells and that
the hiPSC-endoderm was a highly pure population, making
it a promising endoderm source for SDC-LO generation.

hiPSC-endoderm, ECs, and MCs
Combining the methods of cellular isolation, hiPSC re￾programming, and hepatic differentiation, we success￾fully obtained the essential cell sources for SDC-LO
generation, including single donor-derived hiPSC￾endoderm, ECs, and MCs with high purity. To
investigate whether these cells can be used for SDC-LO
generation, single donor-derived EC-iPSC-endoderm,
UC-ECs, and UC-MCs were seeded simultaneously in a
3D microwell culture plate (Fig. 3a). The three cell types

and these SDC-LOs maintained an organoid morphology
during extended culture (Fig. 3b). After 15 days of differ￾entiation, immunocytochemical analysis revealed that
SDC-LOs were successfully differentiated into functional
hepatic lineages with positive expression of ALB and
A1AT (Fig. 3c). Compared with EC-hiPSC-derived
HLCs, differentiated SDC-LOs showed upregulation of
the hepatic genes ALB, G6PC, RBP4, TAT, and TDO2;

metabolism-related genes CPS1 and OTC (Fig. 3d).
Moreover, the capacity for ALB secretion and urea pro￾duction in the differentiated SDC-LOs was increased by
12.98-fold and 39.01-fold, respectively, compared to that
in EC-iPSC-HLCs, reaching a level similar to that in
PHHs (Fig. 3e, f ). CYP3A4 activity in SDC-LOs was also
38.30-fold higher than that in EC-iPSC-HLCs, and
CYP3A4 activity was induced by rifampicin in SDC-LOs
but not in EC-iPSC-HLCs (Fig. 3g). These results indi￾cate that single donor-derived hiPSC-endoderm, ECs,
and MCs can be used for SDC-LO generation and that
SDC-LOs can be effectively differentiated into functional
organoids exhibiting ALB secretion and urea production
abilities similar to those of PHHs.

Functional SDC-LOs improve survival in ALF model mice
Next, we investigated whether the functional SDC-LOs
could be used as an effective transplant in ALF therapy.
We generated an ALF model in Alb-TRECK/SCID mice
by intraperitoneal injection of DT (Fig. 4a) [20]. After
48 h, the mice developed a phenotype typical of ALF, as
evidenced by increased serum ALT (> 15,000 IU/l) and
AST (> 10,000 IU/l) levels (Fig. 4b), and 70% of the mice
died within 7 days (Fig. 4c). Macroscopic images and
histological analysis showed that the hepatocellular
structure was damaged, and massive hepatocellular ne￾crosis and hepatocellular steatosis were present with
minimal inflammatory infiltration (Fig. 4d). After we
transplanted differentiated SDC-LOs into the renal
subcapsular spaces of ALF mice, the survival rate was
significantly improved compared to that of the sham
group (Fig. 4c). Indeed, 70% of mice showed recovery
from ALF upon SDC-LO transplantation (Fig. 4c), with
decreased serum ALT and AST levels at 2 days after
transplantation (Fig. 4b). We also observed a decrease in
serum ALT and AST levels in the sham group, but the
level of ALT was still higher than that in LO￾transplanted mice (Fig. 4b). In SDC-LO-transplanted
ALF mice, the injured liver underwent a regeneration
process with enlarged hepatocytes and an increase in
hepatic nuclear size (Fig. 4d) [24]. To further confirm
that transplanted SDC-LOs can perform hepatic func￾tions in ALF mice, a human-specific hepatic protein,

human ALB, was measured in transplanted mice by
ELISA. In SDC-LO-transplanted mice, human ALB was
detected at concentrations of 1128 ± 338.1 ng/ml and
988.2 ± 660.3 ng/ml at 2 days and 7 days after trans￾plantation, respectively (Fig. 4e). After 2 weeks, the kid￾neys of mice transplanted with SDC-LOs were collected,
and histological analysis revealed that the transplants
had hepatic cord-like structures characteristic of the
adult liver (Fig. 4f ) and were comprised of cells express￾ing human-specific ALB and A1AT (Fig. 4g). These re￾sults indicate that differentiated SDC-LOs were able to
rapidly perform hepatic functions in ALF mice and im￾prove the microenvironment for liver regeneration to
promote recovery from ALF.
Discussion
To ensure that LOs can be produced on a large enough
scale for further clinical application, the three required
cell types should be derived from a single donor and
capable of large-scale expansion or production in vitro.
ECs and hiPSCs can be stably expanded in vitro, whereas
BM-MCs exhibit a low proliferative capacity that is grad￾ually lost over repeated passaging [25]. In this study, we
found that UC-MCs represented a suitable replacement
for BM-MCs in LO generation and differentiation.
Compared with BM-MCs, UC-MCs have a higher
proliferation rate and can be isolated from newborns
without invasive procedures [25]; these characteristics of
UC-MCs provide a special advantage for massively gen￾erating LOs and enabling the application of LOs in
regenerative medicine. Although some differences be￾tween UC-MCs and BM-MCs have been reported [26],
UC-MCs could serve the same function as BM-MCs in
LO generation and differentiation when combined with
ECs. More importantly, the use of UC-MCs makes it
possible to generate LOs from a single donor.
Liver transplantation is the only proven therapy for
ALF but is limited by the shortage of HLA-matched
donor livers. The risk of death increases without HLA
matching in liver transplantation [2, 4]. Host cell-derived
or HLA-matched donor-derived transplants have trad￾itionally been used to avoid immune rejection. The use
of hiPSCs reprogrammed from host somatic cells has led
to unprecedented opportunities for generating host￾derived or HLA-matched donor-derived cells and
organoids [27]. Transplantation of HLA-matched iPSC￾derived epithelial cells and neurons in recipients resulted
in attenuation of the immune response, with normal
function of transplanted cells [28, 29]. In this study, we
confirmed that functional LOs can be generated from
single donor-derived cells and improve the survival rate
of ALF mice after transplantation, underscoring the pos￾sibility of using self-derived LOs or HLA-matched LOs
for liver disease therapy. The use of homozygous HLA
LOs is thought to exhibit potential for further clinical ap￾plication of an effective LO banking system [30]. Previous
studies have estimated that a biobank of hiPSCs from 150
selected homozygous HLA-typed volunteers would match
93% of the population in the United Kingdom [31], and 50
selected homozygous HLA donors would cover 90.7% of
the Japanese population [32]. By collecting single donor￾derived ECs and MCs from such selected homozygous
HLA-typed donors and generating same donor-derived
hiPSCs, an LO biobank including homozygous HLA￾typed hiPSCs, ECs, and MCs from the same donor could
be established that could provide the majority of the
population with LOs for ALF treatment as well as the
treatment of other liver diseases.
The liver is the major organ involved in the detoxifica￾tion of various metabolites. In ALF patients, the rapid
loss of liver metabolic function results in the accumula￾tion of toxic metabolites that cause further injury to the
body [1]. ALF is a severe form of liver injury that is po￾tentially reversible, as the rapid elimination of toxic me￾tabolites can promote liver regeneration and minimize
the risk of post-transplant complications [1]. To elimin￾ate toxic metabolites, a bioartificial liver support system
has been developed based on induced human functional
hepatocytes that can modulate blood levels of ammonia
and bilirubin, prolonging survival in a porcine ALF
model [33]. Here, we found that transplanted SDC-LOs
could rapidly perform hepatic functions and that the
ALT levels in LO-transplanted mice decreased faster de￾crease those in the sham group. These findings indicate
that SDC-LOs perform metabolic detoxification and
synthetic functions in ALF mice and eliminate the
accumulation of toxic metabolites to provide a healthy
microenvironment for liver regeneration, thereby im￾proving survival. The ability of SDC-LOs to quickly
perform hepatic functions may be attributable to the
culture system. SDC-LOs were generated and differenti￾ated in a 3D suspension microwell plate that enabled the
collection of LOs without enzyme treatment and max￾imally preserved LO function for transplantation. This
simple collection method also enables the collection of
functional LOs produced on a large scale in a short
amount of time for clinical transplantation.
Conclusions
In this study, we successfully obtained single donor-derived
hiPSC-endoderm, ECs, and MCs with high purity. These
three type cells were able to organize into SDC-LOs and
differentiate into functional organoids that performed hep￾atic functions in ALF mice and improved the survival rate.
Although further efforts are necessary to evaluate the use
of SDC-LOs in clinical treatment, this proof-of-concept
demonstration of functional SDC-LO transplantation pro￾vides a promising novel approach for ALF therapy.
