Background: Occult hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is characterised by the presence of HCV-RNA in the
liver in the absence of anti-HCV, and serum viral RNA. Up to 70% of these patients also have HCV-RNA in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) but it is not known if HCV is replicating in these cells.
Aim: We studied possible HCV replication in PBMC of 18 patients with an occult HCV infection who were
selected on the basis of HCV-RNA positivity in PBMC.
Methods: Detection of HCV-RNA positive and negative strands in PBMC was done by strand specific
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and by in situ hybridisation.
Results: The presence of HCV-RNA positive strand in PBMC was confirmed in all patients by strand specific
RT-PCR and by in situ hybridisation. Mean percentage of PBMC which had the HCV-RNA positive strand
was 3.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1–4.4) The HCV-RNA negative strand was found in the PBMC of
11/18 (61%) patients by strand specific RT-PCR and confirmed by in situ hybridisation, and the
percentage of PBMC harbouring the HCV-RNA negative strand was 3.1% (95% CI 0.8–5.5). There was a
significant correlation (p = 0.001, r = 0.84) between the percentage of PBMC with the HCV-RNA positive
strand and that of PBMC with the HCV-RNA negative strand.
Conclusion: HCV replicates in the PBMC of patients with occult HCV infection and thus, although these
patients do not have serum HCV-RNA, they could be potentially infectious.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a single stranded positive RNA
virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family.1 Although the
mechanism of HCV replication is not fully understood,
it is assumed that virus replication involves the synthesis of a
negative strand RNA molecule that acts as a template for
production of positive strand or genomic HCV-RNA.2 Thus
detection of the HCV-RNA negative strand is indicative of
viral replication. The liver is the main site of virus replication
but it can also replicate at extrahepatic sites such as
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).3–6 Regarding
this infection of PBMC, it has been shown that HCV can
propagate in lymphoid cell cultures and that the virus derived
is infectious.7 8 In addition, it has been proposed that PBMC
could be the source of recurrent HCV infection after liver
transplantation.9 10
We recently described the existence of occult HCV
infections, defined by the presence of HCV-RNA in the liver
in the absence of anti-HCV and serum HCV-RNA.11 In
addition, up to 70% of these patients also had HCV-RNA in
their PBMC.11 As these patients do not have detectable
circulating viral RNA, an important question with regard to
transmission of occult HCV infection is whether HCV
replicates in PBMC. Thus in the present work we investigated
HCV replication in PBMC of patients with occult HCV
infection by detection of HCV-RNA positive and negative
strands using a strand specific reverse transcriptase-poly￾merase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and in situ hybridisation.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
In a previous report,11 we described a group of patients with
abnormal liver function tests of unknown aetiology who had
an occult HCV infection (HCV-RNA in the liver, as detected
by RT-PCR and in situ hybridisation but anti-HCV and serum
HCV-RNA negative). Among them, we selected for the
present work those who: (i) were also HCV-RNA positive in
the PBMC sample obtained on the same day of the liver
biopsy and (ii) had available aliquots of that PBMC sample
stored in liquid nitrogen. A total of 18 patients fulfilled the
inclusion criteria and were included in this study, after giving
written informed consent to participate. The characteristics of
these 18 patients are shown in table 1. None reported risk
factors (blood transfusions, drug abuse, sexual behaviour,
tattoos, etc) for HCV infection. Four of these 18 patients had
abnormal levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine
aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma-glutamyl transpepti￾dase (GGTP) simultaneously; five had abnormal values of
two liver enzymes (ALT and GGTP four patients; ALT and
AST one patient), and the remaining nine patients had
abnormal levels of only one liver enzyme (GGTP six patients
and ALT three patients). PBMC samples from six healthy
volunteers with normal liver function tests, who were
repeatedly HCV-RNA negative in PBMC, were used as
negative controls.
Total RNA was isolated from PBMC using the SV Total
RNA Isolation System (Promega Corp., Madison, Wisconsin,
USA) and, after precipitation, the RNA pellet was dissolved in
diethyl-pyrocarbonate treated water. The amount of total
RNA was determined by spectrophotometry and 0.5 mg of
RNA were used for detection of HCV-RNA of both polarities.
Synthetic HCV-RNA
Synthetic HCV-RNA positive and negative strands were
generated by in vitro transcription of the recombinant
plasmid pC59NCR, which contains the complete 59 non￾coding region of the HCV genome. After plasmid linearisa￾tion, the RNA positive and negative strands were synthesised

by transcription from the SP6 RNA polymerase promoter or
the T7 RNA polymerase promoter, respectively. The plasmid
template was removed by two rounds of digestion for
30 minutes at 37˚C with 1 U/mg DNA of DNase I
(Promega), followed by phenol-chloroform extraction.
Concentrations of both HCV-RNA strand transcripts were
determined spectrophotometrically and the absence of
residual DNA was assayed by PCR without the RT step.
Tenfold serial dilutions of the RNA templates were made in
RNA extracted from a HCV negative cell line (HepG2) such
that all dilutions had a final concentration of 0.5 mg of total
RNA.
Strand specific RT-PCR
Specific detection of HCV-RNA positive and negative strands
was done by performing the corresponding DNA synthesis at
high temperature using the thermostable enzyme Tth.
Briefly, cDNA synthesis was carried out in 20 ml of reaction
buffer consisting of 50 pM of the corresponding primer from
the 59NC region of the HCV genome, 16 RT buffer (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA), 1 mM MnCl2,
200 mM of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, and 5 U of
rTth (Applied Biosystems). After 20 minutes at 65˚C, Mn2+
was chelated with 8 ml of the 106 chelating buffer (Applied
Biosystems). Thereafter, 50 pM of the opposite primer was
added, the volume adjusted to 100 ml, and the MgCl2
concentration adjusted to 2.2 mM. Amplification was per￾formed as follows: initial denaturing for two minutes at 94˚C
and 30 cycles of 94˚C for 30 seconds, 55˚C for 30 seconds, and
72˚C for one minute followed by a final extension at 72˚C for
seven minutes. For detection of the HCV-RNA positive
strand, the cDNA reverse primer was 59CAT GGT GCA CGG
TCT ACG AGA CC 39 and the forward primer was 59GGC GAC
ACT CCA CCA TGA ATC AC 39. The same primers were used
in reverse order for detection of the HCV-RNA negative
strand.
A sample of the RT-PCR reaction (10 ml) was added to the
second nested PCR and amplified for another 30 cycles, using
as inner forward primer, 59CTG TGA GGA ACT ACT GTC TT
39, and as the reverse inner primer, 59CTC GCA AGC ACC CTA
TCA GG 39. PCR products (266 bp) were visualised by 1.4%
agarose gel electrophoresis.
During extraction, RT, and amplification steps, the guide￾lines of Kwok and Higuchi were carefully followed to prevent
PCR contamination.12
Detection of HCV-RNA positive and negative strands
in PBMC by fluorescent in situ hybridisation
The HCV-RNA positive strand was detected using a cRNA
probe of negative polarity obtained by in vitro transcription
of the pC59NCR in the presence of digoxigenin-11-UTP
(Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA).
Detection of the HCV-RNA negative strand was performed
with a complementary digoxigenin labelled cRNA probe
spanning 390 nucleotides of the HCV core coding region,
obtained by in vitro transcription of the pCcore plasmid.
For fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH), PBMC were
resuspended in KCl (0.075 M) for 10 minutes at 37˚C,
pelleted at 500 g for five minutes, and resuspended in 15 ml
of phosphate buffered saline. Resuspended cells were mixed
with 35 ml of low melting point agarose maintained at 37˚C,
deposited onto a glass slide (that was previously precoated
with 0.65% standard agarose and dried at 80˚C), covered with
a cover slip, and allowed to solidify at 4˚C. Finally, coverslips
were gently removed by immersing the slides in phosphate
buffered saline at room temperature. Hybridisation with both
HCV-RNA riboprobes was carried out at 42˚C for 16 hours in
a humid chamber. After hybridisation, samples were washed
at 42˚C in 26SSC, 0.56SSC, and 0.16SSC (15 minutes each)
(206SSC: 3 M NaCl, 3 mM trisodium citrate). Digoxigenin
labelled hybrids were detected with fluorescein isothiocya￾nate conjugate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Signal
intensity was amplified using the Fluorescent Antibody
Enhancer set for DIG detection kit (Roche Molecular
Biochemicals). Cells were counterstained with 4-6 diami￾dino-2-phenylindole. Fluorescent signals were observed
using a Nikon Eclipse E-400 light-microscope (Nikon Co.,
Tokyo, Japan) and the images were captured with a high
resolution monochrome CCD camera (DIC-N; Wared
Precision Instruments, Cambridge, UK) At least 2000 cells
per sample were counted to obtain the percentage of positive
cells.
Statistical analysis
Data analysis was performed using SSPS version 9.0 for
windows (Chicago, Illinois, USA). Normality and homoced￾asticity of continuous variables were tested by the
Komolgorov-Smirnov and Levene’s tests, respectively. The
mean was compared with the Student’s t (variables with
normal distribution) or with the Mann-Whitney U test
(variables with non-normal distribution). Categorical vari￾ables were compared using the x2 or Fisher’s exact tests.
Pearson (variables with Gaussian distribution) or Spearman
(non-normally distributed variables) correlation coefficients
were determined to study the existence of correlation
between the variables. All tests performed were two sided
and statistical significance was considered at a p value ,0.05.
RESULTS
To assess the sensitivity and specificity of our strand specific
RT-PCR assay, serial dilutions of synthetic HCV-RNA positive
and negative strands were used as RNA templates. The
analysis showed that the positive strand assay detected the
HCV-RNA positive strand at 0.1 fg and the HCV-RNA
negative strand at 10 pg (fig 1A). Thus, discrimination was
100 000-fold. Similarly, the negative stand assay detected the
HCV-RNA negative strand at 1 fg while the RNA positive
strand was detected at 10 pg (fig 1B), resulting in a 10 000-
fold discrimination.
The results obtained by strand specific RT-PCR assay as
well as by the FISH technique confirmed that all 18 patients
with occult HCV infection had the HCV-RNA positive strand
in their PBMC. In contrast, PBMC from six healthy donors
were negative. Mean percentage of PBMC showing fluor￾escent signals for the HCV-RNA positive strand was 3.3%
(95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1–4.4)
When studying the presence of the RNA negative strand in
PBMC, we found that 11/18 (61%) patients were positive by
the strand specific RT-PCR. The existence of the HCV-RNA
negative strand was confirmed by FISH in these 11 cases
while no hybridisation signals were seen in the PBMC of the

negative strand (fig 2). However, no correlations were seen
between the percentages of HCV-RNA positive or negative
strands in PBMC and in hepatocytes. In addition, the
existence of HCV replication in PBMC was not related to
the presence of HCV replication in the liver (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
In the present work, we investigated if HCV replicates in the
PBMC of 18 patients with occult HCV infection (who had
HCV-RNA in their PBMC) by specific detection of viral RNA
positive and negative strands using two techniques: a highly
specific RT-PCR assay and FISH. The specificity of our RT￾PCR assay was assessed with serial dilutions of synthetic
HCV-RNA positive and negative strands, showing 10 000–
100 000-fold differentials between detection of the correct
and incorrect strands of RNA. These differentials confirm the
specificity of HCV-RNA negative strand detection in PBMC
as in vivo the HCV-RNA positive-negative strand ratio is
10–100-fold.4 13
Detection of the HCV-RNA positive strand by RT-PCR and
FISH confirmed the existence of HCV infection in the PBMC
of the 18 patients with occult HCV infection included in the
study. Analysis of the HCV-RNA negative strand showed that
HCV was replicating in the PBMC of the majority (61%) of
patients with occult HCV infection, with concordant results
between the two different techniques. This percentage of
HCV replication in PBMC of patients with occult HCV
infection is similar to that reported in PBMC of patients
with chronic hepatitis C.356
The existence of HCV infection and replication in PBMC in
the absence of detectable serum HCV-RNA has also been
described in anti-HCV positive patients years after sponta￾neous or antiviral therapy induced clearance of serum viral
RNA and normalisation of transaminases.14 15 As there is no
detectable circulating viral RNA, it could be assumed that
HCV infection and replication in PBMC may be related to the
status of intrahepatic HCV-RNA. However, in these patients
with occult HCV infection, we did not find any correlation
between the percentage of hepatocytes showing the HCV￾RNA positive or negative strand and these percentages in
PBMC. Moreover, the existence of HCV replication in PBMC
was not related to the presence of HCV replication in the
liver. Whether this lack of association reflects infection with
HCV variants of different tropisms or with different replica￾tion capacities is currently under investigation.
In contrast, the percentage of PBMC harbouring the HCV￾RNA positive and negative strands were highly correlated
with each other (r = 0.84; p = 0.001) and the mean percen￾tage of infected PBMC was significantly higher (p = 0.009) in
patients with HCV replication in PBMC than in those without
HCV replication. Taking into account that if replication occurs
the HCV-RNA positive-negative ratio is within 10–100-
fold,4 13 perhaps in these negative cases HCV replication is
taking place but at such a low level that detection is beyond
the sensitivity of the assay.
In conclusion, our findings indicate that HCV replicates in
the PBMC of patients with occult HCV infection. As it has
been shown that HCV can propagate in lymphoid cell cultures
and that the virus derived is infectious,7 8 it should be
determined whether these patients (although they do not
have detectable circulating virus) are potentially infectious.
