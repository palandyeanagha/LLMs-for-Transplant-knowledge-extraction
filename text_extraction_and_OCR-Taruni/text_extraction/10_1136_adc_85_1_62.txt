Abstract
The median life expectancy for cystic fibrosis is now over 30 years,
and it is projected that in newborn infants it will become more than
40 years. The identification of the cystic fibrosis gene and its
product, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
(CFTR), has widened the spectrum of the disease from the classical
case of the infant with cystic fibrosis to the elderly childless man


with unexplained bronchiectasis. There is increasing evidence of the
advantages of newborn screening for cystic fibrosis and subsequent
specialist care. Management concentrates on optimising nutritional
status and preventing lung infection and inflammation.
