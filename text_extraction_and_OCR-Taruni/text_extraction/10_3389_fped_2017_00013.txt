Background: Little is known about the clinical value of late gadolinium enhancement 
(LGE), in children affected by dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).
Materials and methods: We retrospectively evaluated 15 patients (8 ±  6  years, 6 
males) with diagnosis of DCM who underwent cardiac magnetic resonance since 2014. 
All scans were performed with a 1.5 T system (Aera, Siemens). Study protocol included 
cine steady-state free precession sequences, followed by administration of 0.2 mmol/kg 
of gadolinium-based contrast agent. Inversion recovery Turbo Flash sequences, in the 
same position of cine images, were acquired 10–15 min after the injection of contrast 
agent, in order to assess the presence of LGE. The latter was considered positive with 
a signal intensity >6 SD from normal myocardial tissue. Indexed end-diastolic volume 
(EDVi) and end-systolic volume (ESVi), and left ventricle (LV) ejection fraction (EF) were 
calculated by using dedicated software on off-line workstation. Global longitudinal strain 
and diastolic function were evaluated by echocardiography. Clinical follow-up, including 
death, transplant, and listing for heart transplant [major adverse cardiac events (MACE)], 
were evaluated. Patients were divided into two different subgroups: negative (Group A) 
and positive (Group B) for presence of LGE. Statistical analysis was performed by using 
Mann–Whitney U test (p < 0.05 considered as statistically significant).
results: Seven patients (47%) showed LGE. A global diffuse subendocardial pattern 
was evident in all patients presenting LGE (7/7, 100%). The following main LV indexes 
were observed in the two subgroups. Group A: EDVi = 96 ± 33 ml, ESVi = 56 ± 29 ml, 
LV EF = 45 ± 10%, global longitudinal strain = −16 ± 5%, E/e′ ratio = 10 ± 3, MACE = 1. 
Group B: EDVi = 130 ± 60 ml, ESVi = 89 ± 43 ml, LV EF = 31 ± 6%, global longitudinal 
strain = −13 ± 4%, E/e′ ratio = 9 ± 3, MACE = 3. There was no statistically significant 
difference between the two groups, in terms of EDVi (p: 0.2), ESVi (p: 0.2), and E/e′ ratio 
(0.9), whereas a significant difference of LV EF, presence of significative mitral regurgi￾tation, and global longitudinal strain were observed (respectively, p: 0.03, p: 0.009, and 
p: 0.03).

INTRODUCTION
Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is defined as a ventricular dilata￾tion associated with systolic dysfunction not secondary to other 
cardiac abnormalities such as coronary artery disease, valvular, 
or congenital heart disease. Incidence of DCM in children is 
extremely rare (0:58 cases/100,000 children) (1).
Etiology of dilation is known in about three thirds of cases; 
however, the majority remains without a confirmed diagnosis 
(1, 2).
Dilated cardiomyopathy development in pediatric patients 
may be either genetic linked, if genetic pedigree of the family is 
responsible for it, or non-familiar (1). DCM in children could be 
expression of neuromuscular disorders, typically characterized by 
dystrophin mutations. Finally, DCM can be linked to congenital 
errors of metabolism such as lysosomal storage diseases, carnitine 
deficiency, and mitochondrial myopathies (3).
Ventricular dilatation may also be due to “non-familiar” 
conditions. In these cases, DCM is usually the consequence of a 
previous myocarditis, chemotherapy, or fulminant Kawasaki (1).
Clinical manifestations of DCM can range from asympto￾matic patients up to heart failure and development of malignant 
arrhythmias (4). If medical treatment fails, patients are listed for 
cardiac transplantation, or must receive mechanical circulatory 
support.
Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) has gained a crucial role 
in adults with DCM, since CMR provides reliable information 
about cardiac function and muscle tissue characterization (5). 
In fact, CMR is able to evaluate with great accuracy regional left 
ventricle (LV) wall motion, global systolic function, and pres￾ence of myocardial fibrosis (6, 7). Late gadolinium enhancement 
(LGE) imaging enables identification and quantification of areas 
of myocardial fibrosis. Hence, CMR represents a first etiological 
non-invasive step, which could be helpful to distinguish between 
ischemic and non-ischemic DCM.
In adult patients, various studies demonstrated not only a 
diagnostic but also a prognostic role of LGE especially in non￾ischemic disease (5, 8–11).
Cardiac magnetic resonance assessment of myocardial fibrosis 
has been reported to be useful in patients with congenital heart 
disease (12–15) and cardiomyopathies; however, data about 
LGE imaging in children are still limited. Pediatric patients 
with DCM show a pattern of LGE distribution quite different 
compared to adults. Furthermore, children usually show a more 
heterogeneous pattern distribution of LGE compared to adults 
(15, 16).
Hence, our aim was to investigate the potential role of CMR 
and LGE in children affected by DCM.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
We retrospectively evaluated all patients affected by DCM who 
underwent cardiac MRI, between December 2014 and March 
2016, at our institution.
Diagnosis of DCM was based on echocardiographic find￾ings with LV end-diastolic dimension Z score >2 and LV EF 
<50%.
Patients younger than 8 years old underwent cardiac mitral 
regurgitation (MR) under general anesthesia.
This study was carried out in accordance with the recom￾mendations of the “Ethical Committee of the Ospedale Pediatrico 
Bambino Gesù” with written informed consent from all subjects. 
All subjects gave written informed consent in accordance with 
the Declaration of Helsinki.
CMR Acquisition Protocol
Cardiac magnetic resonance was performed with 1.5 T magnet 
(Aera, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Enrolled patients met 
the eligibility requirements, according to the guidelines of the 
American College of Radiology of 2013 (17). Patients with DCM 
secondary to other cardiac conditions and with glomerular filtra￾tion rate <30 ml/min/1.73 m2
, or frequent ventricular arrhyth￾mias, were excluded from the study.
Our protocol included cine steady-state free precession (SSFP) 
sequences acquired on the long-axis cardiac planes: four cham￾bers, two chambers, and three chambers (FOV 400 × 310 mm2
, 
slice thickness 6–8  mm, acquisition matrix 256  ×  173, voxel 
size 1.5 mm × 1.5 mm × 7 mm, echo/repetition time (TE/TR) 
1.1/40 ms, readout bandwidth 930 Hz/pixel, and flip angle 69°), 
followed by a “stack” of contiguous SSFP cine images, with the 
same technical parameters, acquired along cardiac short axis, to 
cover the whole ventricle—from base to apex.
After 10–15  min of intravenous administration of contrast 
agent (DOTAREM, Roissy, Guerbet, France), at 0.2  mmol/kg, 
T1-weighted inversion recovery sequences [FOV 400 × 290 mm2
, 
slice thickness 6–8 mm, acquisition matrix 256 × 156, voxel size 
1.3 × 1.3 × 7, TE/TR 3 ms/747 ms, flip angle 25°, and inversion 
time (TI) 250–425 ms], were acquired along the same planes of 
the cine SSFP images, in order to evaluate the presence of LGE.
To determine the correct TI, for nulling normal myocardial 
signal intensity, a look-locker sequence was acquired in one 
short-axis plane.
Steady-state free precession cine images and T1 inversion 
recovery sequence for determining LGE, both were acquired in 
expiratory apnea.

Left Ventricular Systolic Function
The cine SSFP acquisitions acquired in short axis were trans￾ferred to an off-line workstation (CMR42, Circle Cardiovascular 
Imaging, Calgary, AB, Canada) and analyzed using the Simpson 
rule. End-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), 
and ejection fraction (EF) were calculated for each patient. 
Subsequently, both EDV and ESV have been indexed for body 
surface area (BSA).
MR and Left Atrial Dilatation
Mitral regurgitation was quantitatively assessed from LV stroke 
volume and phase contrast velocity mapping flow measurements 
in the aorta acquired during free-breathing (18). MR regurgitant 
volume was calculated as LV stroke volume (ml/beat)—aortic 
forward flow (mL/beat). MR regurgitant fraction (RF) was 
calculated as: [regurgitant volume (mL/beat) ×  100]/LV stroke 
volume (mL/beat). MR when present was classified as follows: 
mild (RF  <  20%), moderate (20%  ≤  RF  <  40%), and severe 
(RF ≥ 40%).
Left atrial dilatation was qualitatively assessed on cine SSFP 
sequences acquired, respectively, on the three different long axis 
view (four, two, and three chambers).
Echocardiographic Assessment
All patients underwent a complete transthoracic echocardio￾graphic examination using a Philips iE33 machine (Philips Medical 
Systems, Andover, MA, USA). Standard Doppler analysis was 
performed to obtain LV inflow velocities at the mitral valve tips, 
including peak early diastolic filling (E) and late diastolic peak 
velocities (A). Tissue Doppler analysis was performed to obtain 
longitudinal early diastolic (e′) myocardial velocity calculated on 
the septum and lateral wall. Ratio of E/e′ was derived to obtain 
an estimate of LV filling pressure. Speckle tracking imaging was 
used to obtain longitudinal (Lε) strain of the LV. Longitudinal 
strain were obtained from the analysis of three consecutive beats 
from the apical four-chamber window and expressed as percent 
of systolic deformation.
Clinical Follow-up
The whole population was followed up for major adverse cardiac 
events (MACE) defined as a composite endpoint of death, trans￾plant, and listing for heart transplant. The median follow-up was 
17 months.
Statistical Analysis
Analysis was performed using a commercial software (IBM SPSS 
Statistics for Macintosh, Version 20.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, 
USA).
The distribution of indexed end diastolic volume (EDVi), 
indexed end-systolic volume (ESVi), LV EF, E/e′ ratio, and global 
longitudinal strain was established using the Shapiro–Wilk test. 
Subsequently Mann–Whitney U test was performed in order to 
assess a statistical significative difference between patients posi￾tive and negative for the presence of myocardial LGE. One-way 
ANOVA was used to compare severity MR and atrial dilatation in 
both groups. A cutoff value of p< 0.05 was considered statistically 
significant.
RESULTS
Fifteen patients were enrolled. Mean age was 8 ± 6 years. Main 
demographic data of the overall population are resumed in 
Table 1.
Within the whole population, the mean LV EF was 38 ± 11%, 
LV end-diastolic indexed volume was 111 ± 51 ml/m2
. In seven 
patients (47%), there was significant myocardial LGE. A global 
diffuse (involving majority of LV segments) subendocardial 
pattern was evident in all patients presenting LGE (7/7, 100%) 
(Figures 1 and 2). Main CMR findings are summarized in Table 2.
The study population was divided into two groups: patients 
with no evidence of significant LGE (Group A, eight patients) and 
patients with the presence of diffuse subendocardial LGE (Group 
B, seven patients). The two subgroups were well matched for age 
and sex.
In Group A, the main findings were (values expressed as 
average ±  standard deviation): age 7 ±  6  years, indexed EDV 
96 ± 33 ml, indexed ESV 56 ± 29 ml, LV EF 45 ± 10%, global 
longitudinal strain = −16 ± 5%, and E/e′ ratio = 10 ± 3. While 
Group B showed the following data: age 9 ± 4 years, indexed EDV 
130 ± 60 ml, indexed ESV 89 ± 43 ml, LV EF 31 ± 6%, global 
longitudinal strain = −13 ± 4%, and E/e′ ratio = 9 ± 3.
Main demographic data, CMR, and echocardiography find￾ings among the two subgroups are shown in Table 3.
No significative difference was observed in terms of indexed 
EDV (p = 0.2) and indexed ESV (p = 0.2). However, LV EF was 
significantly lower in Group B patients compared to Group A 
(p= 0.03). Moreover, the presence of MR—at least moderate—was 
significantly lower in the subgroup of patients with no significant 
LGE (p = 0.009). A significative difference of global longitudinal 
strain was observed between Groups A and B (p = 0.03).
No significative difference in terms of LA dilation (p = 0.5), 
possible indirect sign of diastolic dysfunction, and E/e′ (p = 0.9) 
were observed between Groups A and B.
Major adverse cardiac events were more frequent on Group B 
[3 (38%) vs 1 (14%)], but the small sample size did not allow any 
survival analysis.
DISCUSSION
This study demonstrates that in children affected by DCM, despite 
comparable LV volumes, the presence of diffuse subendocardial 
LGE is associated with a decreased LV global systolic function 
and worst global longitudinal strain. Interestingly, a global dif￾fuse subendocardial pattern, involving majority of LV segments,

papillary muscles, and trabeculae, was evident in all patients 
presenting LGE.
A typical pediatric cardiomyopathy, quite similar to our find￾ing, had been already described in autopsy since the 1950s, and 
it was called primary endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE) (19, 20). 
Such entity was presumed to lead to a DCM (21). Thus, although 
primary EFE had been previously labeled as a separate form of 
cardiomyopathy, in 2006 the new classification of the American 
Heart Association does not consider it anymore as an isolate 
disease and includes it in the spectrum of DCM (22). Primary

EFE in the original description is characterized by the presence 
of ventricular dilatation, diffuse fibrous endocardial thickening, 
upward displacement of the papillary muscles, and valve leaflets 
thickening (20, 23, 24). In terms of “outcome,” EFE is character￾ized by a very poor prognosis in pediatric patients (25, 26).
Our findings seem to confirm this report and corroborate the 
hypothesis that in the presence of EFE the ventricular mechanic is 
compromised, leading to impaired contraction and expansibility 
of the cardiac cavity.
Moreover, development of this peculiar LGE pattern does 
not seem to be related to disease duration, since age of the two 
subgroups is not significantly different.
Our study also shows that significant MR is more frequent in 
patients with significant LGE. This finding should not be linked to 
a functional mechanism, since ventricular dilation is comparable 
in the two subgroups. Therefore, the increasing leakage seems to 
be related to a fibrotic involvement of the valve and subvalvar 
apparatus. This is in keeping with the original description of 
primary EFE where papillary muscles involvement and valve leaf￾lets thickening were described. Our data hence confirm that the 
presence of global diffuse EFE in the setting of children affected 
by DCM identifies a subgroup of patients with a worse disease 
clinical expression.
The etiology of EFE is still debated in literature. Some articles 
attribute the development of this condition to an increased 
response of fetal myocardium in case of viral illnesses including 
mumps, during pregnancy (27). The other main hypothesis is that 
a sort of ischemic/vascular problem is the origin of this peculiar 
finding. This is based on the global hypoperfusion detectable as 
myocytolysis at the examination of autoptic specimen in these 
patients. However, this abnormal finding can be commonly 
found also in patients with DCM (21).
Curiously, between the two subgroups we could not find any 
difference in terms of LA dilation and E/e′ ratio. EFE is com￾monly believed to be a cause of diastolic dysfunction (28, 29). Our 
finding could be due to the poor sample size. Nevertheless, as it 
is well known for adult population, diastolic dysfunction might 
occur later in the natural history of children with DCM.
We must admit that the main limitation of this study is the 
small number of our cohort, which does not allow any definitive 
conclusion. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that indication 
to CMR for a children affected by DCM is not so straightfor￾ward. Since on average general anesthesia is required for patients 
younger than 8 years old, balancing possible risks and benefits, 
the number of patients undergoing CMR in this setting is little 
worldwide, especially in the infancy.
Furthermore, we should admit that the evaluation of MR 
calculated with free breathing phase contrast may represent a 
bias if compared with stroke volume deducted by breath-hold 
cine images. In effect, it has been demonstrated that a trend to 
have higher stroke volume during free breathing phase contrast 
sequences if compared to the breath-hold ones (30). This could 
influence the RF of mitral valve that we calculated with magnetic 
resonance, although a concordance between data acquired on 
echocardiography and magnetic resonance in our cohort was 
observed.
From a clinical point of view, a trend of increased likelihood 
for developing MACE in population with positive LGE was 
found. However, the small sample size did not allow any specific 
survival analysis.
The prognostic role of LGE in children affected by DCM in 
effect is likely one of the most appealing future perspective, which 
could arise from our pilot study. Clearly, our initial findings 
should be confirmed on a wider analysis, performed on a larger 
cohort of patients.
CONCLUSION
In our population of children affected by DCM, LGE is frequent 
(47%), and it shows a characteristic global diffuse subendocardial 
pattern. Despite comparable LV volumes, the presence of fibrosis 
seems to play a key role in these patients, determining a worst 
clinical expression of disease. If LGE is present, patients have a 
significant lower global systolic function and more frequently 
show a significant MR. More data confirming these findings on a 
larger population and investigating the prognostic role of LGE in 
this setting are needed.
