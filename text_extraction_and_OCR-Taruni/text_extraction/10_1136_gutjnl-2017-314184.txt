Abstract
Objective  Immune paresis in patients with 
acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACL F) accounts for 
infection susceptibility and increased mortality. 
Immunosuppressive mononuclear CD14+
HLA -
DR−
 myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) 
have recently been identified to quell antimicrobial 
responses in immune-mediated diseases. We sought 
to delineate the function and derivation of M-MDSC
in patients with ACL F, and explore potential targets to 
augment antimicrobial responses.
Design Patients with ACL F (n=41) were compared 
with healthy subjects (n=25) and patients with 
cirrhosis (n=22) or acute liver failure (n=30). 
CD14+
CD15−
CD11b+
HLA -DR−
 cells were identified 
as per definition of M-MDSC and detailed 
immunophenotypic analyses were performed. 
Suppression of T cell activation was assessed by 
mixed lymphocyte reaction. Assessment of innate 
immune function included cytokine expression in 
response to Toll-like receptor (TLR -2, TLR -4 and TLR -
9) stimulation and phagocytosis assays using flow 
cytometry and live cell imaging-based 
techniques.
Results  Circulating CD14+
CD15−
CD11b+
HLA -DR−
M-MDSCs were markedly expanded in patients with 
ACL F (55% of CD14+ cells). M-MDSC displayed 
immunosuppressive properties, significantly 
decreasing T cell proliferation (p=0.01), producing 
less tumour necrosis factor-alpha/interleukin-6 in 
response to TLR stimulation (all p<0.01), and reduced 
bacterial uptake of Escherichia coli (p<0.001). 
Persistently low expression of HLA -DR during disease 
evolution was linked to secondary infection and 28-
day mortality. Recurrent TLR -2 and TLR -4 stimulation 
expanded M-MDSC in vitro. By contrast, TLR -3 
agonism reconstituted HLA -DR expression and innate 
immune function ex vivo.
Conclusion Immunosuppressive CD14+
HLA-DR−
M-MDSCs are expanded in patients with ACL F. They
were depicted by suppressing T cell function, attenuated 
antimicrobial innate immune responses, linked to 
secondary infection, disease severity and prognosis. 
TLR-3 agonism reversed M-MDSC expansion and innate 
immune function and merits further evaluation as potential 
immunotherapeutic agent.
Significance of this study
What is already known on this subject?
► Immune paresis has been described in patients 
with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) and 
is postulated to be responsible for infection 
susceptibility and adverse outcome.
► Low HLA-DR expression on circulating 
monocytes is associated with poor prognosis.
► Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) 
have recently been defined as 
CD14+
CD15−
CD11b+
HLA-DR−
 cells with T cell 
suppressive function and have been identified 
to dampen immune responses in sterile and 
malignant inflammatory diseases.
What are the new findings?
► M-MDSCs are expanded in the circulation in 
patients with acute liver failure and ACLF.
► Activation of systemic inflammatory response 
syndrome and circulating pathogen-associated 
molecular patterns trigger the expansion of 
M-MDSC in patients with ACLF.
► In addition to suppressing T cell activation, 
M-MDSCs suppress pathogen uptake and 
Toll-like receptor (TLR)-elicited proinflammatory 
responses to microbial challenge.
► Persistence of the M-MDSC phenotype during 
disease progression confers a poor outcome 
and is associated with an increase incidence of 
infections.
► Proof-of-principle data indicate that proportions 
of suppressive M-MDSC can be reduced and 
their antimicrobial function augmented in 
vitro following administration of TLR-3 agonist 
polyI:C
How might it impact on clinical practice in the 
foreseeable future?
► M-MDSC may represent mechanistic 
biomarkers of impaired antimicrobial responses 
and infection susceptibility in patients with 
cirrhosis.
► TLR-3 agonism requires further evaluation as 
an immunotherapeutic strategy to improve 
antimicrobial responses in patients with ACLF.

Hepatology
Introduction
Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is characterised as 
high morbidity and mortality due to profound activation of 
systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and develop￾ment of multiple-organ dysfunction.1
 Recent reports indicate 
that activation of SIRS responses in ACLF results in immune 
dysregulation and is postulated to be responsible for defective 
immune responses to microbial cues, termed immune paresis.2 3
Immune paresis is associated with increased frequency of infec￾tious events in cirrhosis4
 and frequently leads to acute decom￾pensation, extrahepatic organ failure and increased mortality.5
Development of secondary bacterial infections in patients with 
ACLF is associated with a 30-day mortality of 49% and is highly 
predictive of adverse outcome.4
Over the previous decade, it has emerged that myeloid-de￾rived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are elicited under various patho￾logical conditions. MDSCs were initially defined in murine cells 
expressing CD11b and Gr-1 antigen, defined by their ability 
to suppress T cell proliferative and antitumour responses. 
However, human MDSCs are a heterogeneous population 
including a CD14–
CD11b+CD33+CD15+ polymorphonuclear 
fraction (PMN-MDSC) and a CD11b+CD14+HLA-DRlow/–
mononuclear fraction (M-MDSC).6–8 M-MDSCs have recently 
been identified in a wide number of hepatic (eg, chronic viral 
infection, hepatocellular cancer),9–11 non-hepatic systemic 
(eg, sepsis),12 13 organ-specific inflammatory diseases14 15 and 
malignancies.16 17 The increased frequency of this suppressive 
immune cell population has been associated with impaired T cell 
responses and serves as an immunological biomarker of disease 
severity and outcome.
Although the ability of MDSC to supress T cell responses has 
been extensively documented, their innate immune and antimi￾crobial responses remain relatively unexplored. Furthermore, 
while the existence of a HLA-DRlow/− monocyte population has 
been described in acute hepatic inflammatory disorders,18–21
little is known about their lineage, innate and adaptive immune 
function, and their candidacy as a potential immunotherapeutic 
target to restore antimicrobial responses in patients with ACLF.
We hypothesised that persistent exposure to pathogen-asso￾ciated molecular patterns (PAMPs), activation of SIRS and the 
development of ACLF trigger the expansion of immunosup￾pressive M-MDSCs that serve to impair both innate and adap￾tive responses to microbial agents thereby contributing to the 
increased frequency of infections encountered in patients with 
ACLF. We therefore sought to delineate the presence and func￾tion of M-MDSC in patients with ACLF, and explore potential 
targets to modulate their function in order to augment antimi￾crobial responses.
Materials and methods
Patients and sampling
From January 2013 to June 2015, we consecutively recruited 
patients admitted to King’s College Hospital for stable cirrhosis 
(n=22), ACLF (n=41) or acute liver failure (ALF; n=30). 
Patients with ACLF fulfilled the established diagnostic criteria 
developed by the European Association for the Study of the 
Liver-CLIF (Consortium on Chronic Liver Failure).1
 Cirrhosis 
was diagnosed by a previous liver biopsy or clinical presenta￾tion with typical ultrasound or CT imaging. Exclusion criteria 
were age younger than 18 years, malignancy and immunosup￾pressive therapy other than corticosteroids. Within 24hours of 
admission to hospital, blood was sampled for ex vivo analysis of 
monocyte differentiation and function. Results were compared 
with healthy subjects (n=25). For patients with ALF and ACLF, 
sequential tests were done on days 3, 5, 7 and 14 after admis￾sion when feasible. Power calculations indicate that in order to 
detect significant differences in immune function and phenotype 
(eg, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) secretion) with 80% 
statistical power at the 5% significance level, a minimum of 28 
patients would need to be recruited into the ACLF and ALF 
study groups.
Routinely assessed full blood count, international normalised 
ratio, liver and renal function tests, lactate and clinical vari￾ables were entered prospectively into a database. The following 
disease severity scores were calculated: Child-Pugh, Model 
for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), CLIF-SOFA (Sequential 
Organ Failure Assessment),1
 North American Consortium for 
Study of End-stage Liver Disease (NACSELD),22 Acute Physi￾ology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, Simplified Acute Phys￾iology Score II, SOFA scores; infections and 28-day survival 
were documented. The study had been approved by the King’s 
College Hospital Ethics Committee (12/LO/0167). Assent was 
obtained by the patients’ nominated next of kin if they were 
unable to provide informed consent themselves.
CD14+ cell isolation
CD14+ monocytic cells were isolated from peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using the CD14 Microbeads or 
Pan-Monocyte Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Glad￾bach, Germany) as previously described.23 Purity of monocytes 
was assessed by flow cytometry.
Flow cytometry-based phenotyping of monocytes and 
assessment of cytokine responses to Toll-like receptor 
stimulation
Phenotyping of monocytes and measurement of inflammatory 
responses to Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation were done 
based on flow cytometry as previously described.23 Mono￾clonal antibodies against CD14, CD16, CD86, CD163, CD64, 
CD11b, chemokine receptor (CCR) 2, CCR5, CCR7, Annexin 
V, 7-AAD (BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK); HLA-DR, CD32, 
CX3CR1 (eBioscience, Hatfield, UK), and hMer (R&D Systems, 
Abingdon, UK) were purchased from the indicated companies. 
Results are expressed as the percentage of positive cells or 
mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). TNF-α and interleukin-6 
(IL-6; BD Biosciences) levels were determined after a 4–6hour 
incubation of PBMCs with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 100ng/mL), 
Pam3CSK4 (5µg/mL), CpG-ODN2006 (10µg/mL) (Invivogen, 
San Diego, USA). Flow cytometry data were analysed using 
Flowlogic (Inivai Technologies, Mentone, Australia) or FlowJo 
software (V.10.2; Ashland, Oregon, USA).
Mixed lymphocyte reaction
CD14+ monocytic cells from a healthy donor were isolated 
using the Pan-Monocyte Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) as 
previously described.23 Cells were cultured in 25% plasma 
from patients with ACLF (n=8) or healthy controls (n=2) for 
16hours and cocultured with allogeneic CD3+ T cells from 
a different healthy donor, isolated using the Pan-T-cell Isola￾tion Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) in a 1:1 ratio. T cell stimulation was 
induced with anti-CD2/CD3/CD28 beads (T cell Activation/
Expansion Kit; Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufactur￾er’s protocol (2.5×105
 cells in 250µL of Roswell Park Memorial 
Institute medium, 5% AB serum (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, 
Dorset, UK), 1% penicillin/streptomycin). Cells were stained

with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester at day 0. Prolif￾eration was assessed at day 3 of coculture. Experiments were 
performed in triplicate.
Whole blood phagocytosis assay
The pHrodo Escherichia coli Red and Staphylococcus aureus
Green BioParticles Phagocytosis Kit for Flow Cytometry was 
purchased from Invitrogen, Paisley, UK. The instructions of the 
manufacturer were precisely followed. CD14+ cells were stained 
with antibodies against CD14 (APC-H7), CD16 (PercP-Cy5.5), 
HLA-DR (APC), and CD3, CD15, CD19, CD56 (all fluores￾cein isothiocyanate [FITC] channel) for 20min at 4°C. Cells 
were acquired on BD FACS CANTO II flow cytometer (see 
online supplementary methods).
Ex vivo phagocytosis assay in PBMC
For the assessment of phagocytosis of PBMCs in vitro, 500 000 
healthy PBMCs per well were cultured (24hours) in complete 
medium containing 20% healthy controls or ACLF plasma. Cells 
were stimulated with various agents (polyI:C 10µg/mL, LPS 1 
and 10µg/mL, CpG-ODN2006 1 and 10µg/mL) for 4hours. 
Harvested cells were supplemented by 10% autologous plasma 
and pHrodo E. coli Red BioParticles (Invitrogen) were added for 
60min (see online supplementary methods).
Phagocytosis of CD14+ cells: Cell-IQ
CD14+ cells were isolated and cultured (24hours) in complete 
media with 25% plasma from two healthy subjects and two 
patients with ACLF. Cells were supplemented with 10% human 
AB serum and pHrodo E. coli Red BioParticles (Invitrogen).
Real-time cell imaging of the uptake of BioParticles was 
captured by a Cell-IQ system (CMTechnologies), running Imagen 
software V.2.8.12.0 and analyser V.3.3.0 (see online supplemen￾tary methods).
Quantification of bacterial 16S rDNA levels in whole blood 
using TaqMan qRT-PCR
The procedure was carried out under strict aseptic conditions as 
previously reported24 (see online supplementary methods).
In vitro models for the generation of M-MDSC-like cells
The models were adapted from Pena et al.
25 9×106 PBMCs per 
well were cultured on a 12-well plate in 2000µL X-Vivo medium 
(Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) in a 37°C, 5% CO2
 environment. 
Cells were stimulated with or without LPS 10ng/mL, Pam3CSK4 
5µg/mL (Invivogen) or a combination of LPS and Pam3CSK4, 
respectively, for 24hours. After this time, cells were rechallenged 
with LPS or Pam3CSK4 for a further 4hours, and then subjected 
to diverse experiments such as intracellular staining of cytokine 
production, immunophenotyping, phagocytosis and viability 
assays as described above.
For the plasma experiments, CD14+ cells were cultured 
(16 hours) in plasma from healthy subjects (n=3) and patients
with cirrhosis (n=3) and ACLF (n=6), respectively. Subse￾quently, the M-MDSC subset was identified and phenotyped 
as described above. Parts of the cells were transferred to fresh 
medium, stimulated with LPS 100 µg/mL (5 hours) and super￾natants were used for S100A8/A9 ELISA (Systems).
Phagocytosis PCR array
The RT2
 Profiler phagocytosis PCR array (Cat No 330231 
PAHS-173ZA) was purchased from SABiosciences, Quiagen, 
Manchester, UK. The process from RNA extraction to cDNA 
synthesis and quantitative RT-PCR was performed exactly as per 
manufacturer’s protocol (see online supplementary methods).
Statistical analyses
Data are expressed as the median/IQR unless otherwise specified. 
For data that did not follow a normal distribution, the significance 
of differences was tested using the Mann-Whitney or Wilcoxon 
tests; Spearman correlation coefficients and area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUROC) were calculated. Graphs 
were drawn using Prism 7.0a (GraphPad, La Jolla, California).
Results
Patient characteristics
In comparison to patients with ACLF (n=41), patients with 
stable cirrhosis (n=22) and ALF (n=30) were included. Clin￾ical characteristics of the different groups including disease 
stratification scores, the evidence of infection and prognosis are 
summarised in table 1. A 28-day transplant-free survival was 
39% in the ACLF group and 56.6% in the ALF group, while 
17.1% and 23.3% were transplanted, 43.9% and 20% died, 
respectively.
Culture-positive infectious complications occurred in 36.6% 
(n=15) of patients with ACLF, while n=4 had been admitted with 
primary infections and n=12 developed secondary infections as 
previously defined by Bajaj et al,
4
 and in 23% (n=7) of patients 
with ALF (primary infections n=2, secondary infections n=5) 
(table 1). Infectious complications were caused by gram-neg￾ative pathogens (E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acineto￾bacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens), 
gram-positive pathogens (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Entero￾coccus faecium, Streptococcus anginosus, Clostridium diffi￾cile), atypical bacteria (Mycoplasma pneumoniae) and fungi 
(Candida albicans, C. tropicalis).
Increased proportions of circulating immunosuppressive 
monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells in ACLF
Reduced expression of HLA-DR in circulating monocytes from 
patients with liver failure18–21 and other systemic inflammatory 
pathologies has been previously reported and correlated with 
adverse outcome. Recent advances have identified the exis￾tence of an HLA-DRlow/neg (CD14+CD15-CD11b+CD64+) 
expressing myeloid cell population with immunosuppressive 
capabilities termed monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells 
(M-MDSCs).6 8 16 In line with recent phenotypic and functional 
classification of M-MDSC,8
 we show a marked expansion of 
CD14+HLA-DR−CD15−CD11b+CD64+ myeloid cells in ACLF 
(55% (median; IQR 36%–78%)) and ALF (58.5% (median; IQR 
34%–80%)) when compared with patients with stable cirrhosis 
and healthy subjects (figure 1A) which have a suppressive effect 
on T cell proliferation when tested in an allogeneic mixed leuco￾cyte reaction (figure 1B).
In comparison to CD14+HLA-DR+ cells, CD14+HLA-DR− 
cells have reduced expression of differentiation/scavenger 
(CD163, MERTK), activation/costimulatory (CD86), phago￾cytosis (CD64, CD32), certain homing markers (CX3CR1, 
CCR5) but similar expression of myeloid lineage marker CD11b 
and CCR2 (figure 1C–F). Importantly, this immune cell subset 
detailed here as M-MDSCs markedly differs from the recently 
identified suppressive MERTK+ population which is character￾ised by high expression of differentiation and activation markers 
such as CD163 and HLA-DR.23

Hepatology
Circulating M-MDSCs in ACLF have impaired innate responses 
to microbial challenge and refer to poor prognosis and 
infection susceptibility
Compared with healthy subjects, CD14+ cells from patients 
with ACLF exhibit attenuated proinflammatory responses 
(TNF-α/IL-6) to TLR-2 (Pam3CSK4), TLR-4 (LPS) and TLR-9 
(CpG) challenge indicating reduced innate responses to several 
pathogen-induced TLR signalling pathways (see online supple￾mentary figure 1). Compared with classical CD14+HLA-DR+ 
monocytes, M-MDSCs in ACLF were characterised by defective 
proinflammatory cytokine production in response to all different 
TLR ligands (figure 2A). Furthermore, S100A8/A9 protein levels, 
an inflammatory mediator synthesised and secreted preferentially 
by M-MDSC,26 were significantly higher in the plasma of patients 
with ACLF compared with healthy subjects and patients with 
cirrhosis (figure 2B).
In our cohort of patients with cirrhosis and ACLF, HLA-DR 
expression on CD14+ myeloid cells strongly negatively 
correlated with established scores of liver disease severity 
Child-Pugh, MELD, CLIF-SOFA (figure 2C), NACSELD score 
(r=−0.53, p<0.001, n=98) and also SIRS score (r=−0.46, 
p<0.001, n=96). Moreover, admission HLA-DR expression 
on CD14+ cells predicted 28-day survival with a sensitivity 
of 78% and a specificity of 76% for the criterion MFI >1758 
(figure 2D).
Median HLA-DR expression over the first 14 days following 
admission predicted 28-day survival with a sensitivity of 74% and 
a specificity of 77% for the criterion MFI >1617and the onset 
of infection within 28 days of hospitalisation with a sensitivity 
of 75% and a specificity of 67% for the criterion MFI <1500. 
Furthermore, it predicted both the presence of primary infec￾tion (AUROC 0.82/p=0.04, sensitivity 75%, specificity 71%, 
criterion MFI <1346; data not shown) and the development 
of secondary infection (AUROC 0.73/p=0.03, sensitivity 67%, 
specificity 67%, criterion MFI <1488) (figure 2E). These obser￾vations corroborate previous reports linking HLA-DR expression 
on monocytes with adverse prognosis in patients with ACLF20 21
and newly suggest an association between the persistence of the 
M-MDSC population during the course of disease and infection 
susceptibility.
M-MDSCs display impaired bacterial uptake and clearance 
in ACLF
Phagocytosis of bacteria is an important function of myeloid 
cells with regard to effective clearance of invading microor￾ganisms and during sepsis. The proportion of CD14+ cells 
able to phagocytose E. coli particles was significantly reduced 
in patients with ACLF (median 97.4%) and ALF (median 
82.4%; both p<0.0001, figure 3A,B) when compared with 
patients with cirrhosis and healthy controls (median 99%). Also, 
capacity to phagocytose S. aureus particles was reduced in both 
patients with ACLF and ALF and interestingly, the capacity to 
phagocytose gram-negative (E. coli) particles correlated with 
capacity to phagocytose gram-positive (S. aureus) particles 
(see online supplementary figure 2A). The production of reactive 
oxidative metabolites following uptake of E. coli was preserved 
in both patients with ACLF and ALF compared with healthy 
subjects (see online supplementary figure 2B).
A phagocytosis assay was designed to differentially assess 
phagocytosis capabilities of CD14+HLA-DR+ monocytes 
compared with CD14+HLA-DR− M-MDSC (figure 3A). In 
patients with ACLF and ALF, M-MDSC revealed significantly 
reduced phagocytosis of E. coli particles ex vivo when compared 
with HLA-DR+ monocytes. Phagocytosis capacity of E. coli
positively correlated with the degree of HLA-DR expression on 
all CD14+ expressing cells (figure 3C) and TNF-α production 
in response to LPS (r=0.35, p=0.04, n=36). Similar to HLA-DR 
expression, phagocytosis indices correlated with disease severity 
scores (Child-Pugh score, MELD, SIRS score, CLIF-SOFA 
score; figure 3D). Taken together, ex vivo experiments reveal 
that CD14+ cells, in particular the M-MDSC subset, exhibit a 
marked and persistent deficiency in the uptake and clearance 
of bacteria in patients with ALF and ACLF (figure 3E,F and 
online supplementary figure 3).

Transcriptional analysis of circulating monocytes links 
impaired phagocytosis to downregulation of TLR pathways
In order dissect which intracellular pathways may be involved 
in defective bacterial clearance and innate responses in 
ACLF, a phagocytosis-specific RT-PCR array was performed 
comparing mRNA extracts from CD14+ cells of patients with 
ACLF bearing an expanded M-MDSC population compared 
with healthy subjects (figure 4A). Differential expression 
more than twofold revealed higher expression of three genes 
(FcγR1/CD64, MERTK and MFGE8) and reduced expres￾sion of 16 genes interestingly including TLR-3 and TLR-9, 
CD14 and interferon-γ. The findings indicate multiple 
defective pathways of innate immune responses in CD14+ 
cells from patients with ACLF with marked reductions in

responses and therefore represent a potential therapeutic 
target.
Generation of the immunosuppressive M-MDSC population 
in patients with ACLF may result from circulating bacterial 
products stimulating TLR pathways and circulating cytokines
In addition to impaired pathogen responses and clearance 
mechanisms, we also detect elevated levels of bacterial DNA in 
whole blood from patients with ACLF compared with cirrhosis 
and in cirrhosis compared with healthy subjects. Furthermore, 
bacterial DNA titres negatively correlated with the expansion of 
CD14+HLA-DR− M-MDSCs (figure 5A) and with a number of 
indices of disease severity (figure 5B).
We therefore hypothesised that continual exposure to PAMPs 
gives rise to the immunosuppressive M-MDSC with impaired 
antimicrobial responses as described in vivo. In an in vitro model 
administering recurrent LPS stimulation25 as well as recurrent 
Pam3CSK4 stimulation, we observed (1) expansion of M-MDSC 
characterised by reduced expression of HLA-DR, CD16, CD163, 
MERTK, CD64; (2) attenuated proinflammatory responses to 
LPS; and (3) reduced phagocytosis capacity (figure 5C–E and 
online supplementary figures 4A–D and 5A–D). Overall the results 
were more pronounced in the CD14+HLA-DR− MDSC subset 
(see online supplementary figures 4 and 5).
Simultaneous repeated stimulation with LPS and Pam3CSK4 
also results in an expansion of M-MDSC, reduced TLR-evoked 
proinflammatory responses along with an HLA-DRlowCD16lowC￾D163lowMERTKlowCD64low phenotype (see online supplementary 
figure 6). Recurrent PAMP stimulation reduced the numbers of 
viable HLA-DR+ monocytes (Annexin V-/7-AAD-), but did not 
significantly alter the survival of M-MDSC (see online supplemen￾tary figures 4E, 5E, 6E).
In addition to PAMPs, soluble factors such as cytokines have 
been reported to induce M-MDSCs. We and others had previ￾ously shown that numerous cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, IL-8) 
are upregulated in ACLF in comparison to cirrhosis and healthy 
subjects, respectively.23 27 We therefore studied the effect of 
ACLF plasma on healthy CD14+ monocytes in vitro and indeed 
observed the expansion of the M-MDSC population revealing a 
CD16lowMERTKlow phenotype. Also, the secretion of S100A8/A9 
protein levels significantly increased in the cell culture superna￾tants of CD14+ cells after incubation with ACLF plasma. Similar 
to data reported above, the viability of generated M-MDSC was 
not reduced compared with CD14+HLA-DR+ monocytes. The 
data implicate the likely involvement of other soluble mediators 
such as proinflammatory cytokines causing the generation of 
M-MDSC in patients with ACLF (figure 5E).
In vitro TLR-3 stimulation reduces the frequency of M-MDSCs 
and augments antimicrobial responses in ACLF
The downregulated expression of TLRs raised the question 
whether regulation of innate immune function by TLRs was atten￾uated, and whether targeted TLR agonists may have the potential 
to reduce the frequency of M-MDSC. Previous reports and studies 
in man have identified the therapeutic use of TLR-3 agonism 
therapy as an adjuvant for vaccinations as well as for induction 
of antitumour immune responses by decreasing the frequency of 
MDSC.28–31 Moreover, studies demonstrated that TLR-3 agonist 
polyI:C promoted phagocytosis of bacteria in vitro.32
To explore the effect of different TLR agonists on innate 
immune responses, we incubated healthy CD14+ cells in plasma 
from patients with ACLF in the presence or absence of TLR 
agonists (TLR-3, TLR-4, TLR-9). Interestingly, TLR-3 agonist 
polyI:C significantly reduced the proportions of M-MDSC 
population while simultaneously enhancing their phagocy￾tosis capacity in ACLF (figure 6A,B). Conversely, treatment 
with TLR-4 and TLR-9 agonists or NFκ-B inhibitor N-acetyl￾cysteine did not reduce or in fact further increased propor￾tions of M-MDSC and further impaired bacterial phagocytosis 
(figure 6C).
Discussion
In this study, we have shown a marked expansion of M-MDSCs6 8
that impair antimicrobial responses in patients with ACLF. Their 
biological relevance is highlighted through their strong associa￾tion with indices of disease severity and incidence of infectious 
complications in these patients. In addition to impairing T cell 
responses, M-MDSCs are typified by impaired (1) secretion 
of proinflammatory cytokines in response to stimulation with 
a wide range of TLR ligands and (2) phagocytosis of bacteria. 
Analyses of these cells reveal a distinct immunophenotype char￾acterised by reduced expression of tissue scavenger, costimula￾tory and phagocytosis receptors (eg, MERTK, CD64, CD86, 
CD163).
M-MDSCs are not only elevated in patients where primary 
infection has been the trigger for the development of ACLF but 
their persistence is also linked with the development of secondary 
infections. These data echo data from other inflammatory 
pathologies where the expansion of these cells6 8 correlates with 
poor prognosis.9 10 13–19 33–35 These observations urge to prospec￾tively evaluate the role of M-MDSCs as biomarkers of infection 
and survival in large cohorts of patients with cirrhosis and ACLF.
Our data also reveal a less pronounced but significant eleva￾tion in M-MDSC in patients with cirrhosis. Here, we suggest 
that they are likely to evolve as a consequence of continual expo￾sure to elevated concentrations of gut-derived PAMPs and proin￾flammatory mediators that are probably implicated in disease 
progression. Further studies are required to detail how these 
cells evolve and their role and migratory patterns in the liver and 
other tissue sites.

The generation of M-MDSC involves a complex interplay of 
numerous soluble circulating factors.36 37 Using in vitro models, 
we were able to recapitulate the M-MDSC phenotype with 
comparable defects of innate immune function, suggesting that 
the generation and persistence of M-MDSC in ACLF could be 
related to repetitive stimulation by elevated circulating titres of 
PAMPs. This hypothesis is further strengthened by our obser￾vation of increased bacterial DNA levels in patients with ACLF, 
which correlated with the frequency of M-MDSCs. Among 
TLRs, TLR-2/638 and TLR-439–41 ligands have been reported to 
promote MDSC population. Consistent with these findings, our 
data reveal that recurrent stimulation of TLR-2 and/or TLR-4 
induces a similar suppressive M-MDSC-like population as 
described ex vivo.
Given that both ALF and ACLF are conditions characterised by 
a profound activation of SIRS responses, in addition to continual 
PAMP exposure, we also propose that increases in circulating 
inflammatory mediators also contribute to the expansion and 
differentiation of the M-MDSCs. Our in vitro data support 
this concept where we demonstrate that incubation of CD14+

cells in the presence of ACLF plasma induces striking increases 
in their numbers. Taken together, our observations indicate the 
expansion and differentiation of myeloid cells into M-MDSC in 
patients with ACLF occur as a consequence of perpetual immune 
stimulation from microbial and non-microbial inflammatory 
cues.
The transcriptional profile of CD14+ myeloid cells in ACLF 
suggests these cells are functionally reprogrammed to promote 
uptake of apoptotic cells while concomitantly suppressing T 
cell activation, TLR-triggered proinflammatory responses and 
phagocytosis of bacteria. A similar transcriptional profile has 
been recently reported in patients with septic shock where the 
leucocyte transcriptome is reprogrammed towards resolution of 
tissue injury and with concomitant downregulation of genes that 
prime innate and adaptive antimicrobial responses.42 Further 
evidence to support this theory is provided in experimental lung 
injury models where, following clearance of necrotic/apoptotic 
cells, macrophages have an attenuated uptake of bacteria and 
augmented secretion of anti-inflammatory mediators.43 A similar 
mechanism may explain how these immunological defects 
evolve in ACLF, where the host response to severe tissue injury 
and organ dysfunction is skewed towards tissue repair responses 
to the detriment of antimicrobial programmes. We therefore 
hypothesised that selective activation of TLR pathways may 
represent an immunotherapeutic strategy in order to reverse 
M-MDSC expansion and improve antimicrobial responses in 
ACLF.
Deng et al had observed that TLR-3 agonist polyI:C promoted 
bacterial uptake in murine peritoneal macrophages via a TRIF￾IRF-3-mediated mechanism.32 TLR-3 is classically activated by 
double-stranded RNA from viruses, but may also be released 
from degraded bacteria and necrotic cells.44 45 In experimental 
models, TLR-3 activation was associated with an increased 
innate immune cell infiltrate and enhanced infection clear￾ance.46 47 In tumour models, TLR-3 activation reverses the 
expansion and immunosuppressive function of MDSCs29 30
and has been used as an immunotherapeutic agent to promote 
tumouricidal responses.29 48 49 Consistent with these observa￾tions, TLR-3 reduced the frequency of M-MDSC and augments 
innate immune responses and pathogen uptake in patients with 
ACLF. These findings may relate to the fact that TLR-3 differ￾entially regulates phagocytosis and may ‘rebalance’ the phago￾cytosis processes which are skewed predominantly towards 
apoptotic cell clearance in ACLF to the detriment of antimi￾crobial responses. Given that TLR-3 activation has been shown 
to be protective in experimental models of chronic liver injury, 
a TLR-3 agonist may improve antibacterial responses without 
having a detrimental effect on tissue repair processes.32 50 Further 
work using in vitro and in vivo models of disease is required to 
further understand how activation of the TLR-3 pathway modu￾lates inflammatory and antimicrobial responses before consid￾ering its use in human studies.
Although M-MDSCs correlate with indices of disease severity, 
incidence of infectious complications, the data presented in this 
study strongly suggest but cannot conclusively prove that the 
increased frequencies of M-MDSC are responsible for reduced 
pathogen clearance in vivo. Moreover, the immune read-outs 
developed here do not represent point-of care testing that could 
be introduced for clinical use in multicentre cohort studies. 
Future prospective work is therefore required to further evaluate 
Figure 6 HLA-DR expression and phagocytosis capacity are enhanced by Toll-like receptor 3 agonism. (A) Monocytes cultured in plasma from 
patients with ACLF compared with healthy plasma (24 hours) develop a defect in phagocytosis capacity, which is more pronounced in the M-MDSC

the utility of M-MDSC as a predictive biomarker of infection 
susceptibility and an immunotherapeutic target.
In conclusion, we describe a marked expansion of M-MDSC 
in ACLF. These cells are characterised by attenuated immune 
responses to pathogens, defective pathogen clearance mecha￾nisms and a higher incidence of overt infectious complications. 
Perpetual exposure to elevated concentrations of PAMPs and 
inflammatory cytokines involved in SIRS response play a patho￾genic role in the expansion of this immunosuppressive popula￾tion. In vitro data indicate that TLR-3 agonism may reduce the 
frequency of M-MDSC and therefore merit further evaluation 
as potential novel immunotherapeutic strategy to restore antimi￾crobial responses and reduce infectious complications in patients 
with ACLF.
