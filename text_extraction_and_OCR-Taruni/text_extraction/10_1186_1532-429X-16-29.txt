Abstract
Background: Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy in aortic stenosis (AS) is characterized by reduced myocardial
perfusion reserve due to coronary microvascular dysfunction. However, whether this hypoperfusion leads to tissue
deoxygenation is unknown. We aimed to assess myocardial oxygenation in severe AS without obstructive coronary
artery disease, and to investigate its association with myocardial energetics and function.
Methods: Twenty-eight patients with isolated severe AS and 15 controls underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance
(CMR) for assessment of perfusion (myocardial perfusion reserve index-MPRI) and oxygenation (blood-oxygen level
dependent-BOLD signal intensity-SI change) during adenosine stress. LV circumferential strain and phosphocreatine/
adenosine triphosphate (PCr/ATP) ratios were assessed using tagging CMR and 31P MR spectroscopy, respectively.
Results: AS patients had reduced MPRI (1.1 ± 0.3 vs. controls 1.7 ± 0.3, p < 0.001) and BOLD SI change during stress
(5.1 ± 8.9% vs. controls 18.2 ± 10.1%, p = 0.001), as well as reduced PCr/ATP (1.45 ± 0.21 vs. 2.00 ± 0.25, p < 0.001) and LV
strain (−16.4 ± 2.7% vs. controls −21.3 ± 1.9%, p < 0.001). Both perfusion reserve and oxygenation showed positive
correlations with energetics and LV strain. Furthermore, impaired energetics correlated with reduced strain. Eight
months post aortic valve replacement (AVR) (n = 14), perfusion (MPRI 1.6 ± 0.5), oxygenation (BOLD SI change 15.6 ±
7.0%), energetics (PCr/ATP 1.86 ± 0.48) and circumferential strain (−19.4 ± 2.5%) improved significantly.
Conclusions: Severe AS is characterized by impaired perfusion reserve and oxygenation which are related to the
degree of derangement in energetics and associated LV dysfunction. These changes are reversible on relief of pressure
overload and hypertrophy regression. Strategies aimed at improving oxygen demand–supply balance to preserve
myocardial energetics and LV function are promising future therapies.

Background
Aortic valve stenosis (AS) is characterized by pressure
overload left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and im￾paired myocardial perfusion reserve [1]. This has been
shown by a variety of imaging modalities such as posi￾tron emission tomography (PET) [2] and cardiovascular
magnetic resonance (CMR) [3]. In the absence of signifi￾cant coronary stenoses, this finding is indicative of
microvascular dysfunction, but it remains unclear
whether the hypoperfusion seen in severe AS leads to
myocardial tissue deoxygenation and, thus, ischemia
during stress. Such knowledge is important as myocar￾dial tissue hypoxia may play a significant pathophysio￾logical role in the natural history of AS contributing to
the development of LV dysfunction.

myocardial perfusion and oxygenation in the same

setting during vasodilator stress [4]. Assessment of myo￾cardial perfusion reserve during vasodilator stress follow￾ing the first pass of a gadolinium-based contrast agent
is an established CMR technique [5,6]. Oxygenation￾sensitive CMR can non-invasively assess myocardial tissue
oxygenation without the need for exogenous contrast by
measuring blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal
intensity (SI) differences, which reflect deoxygenated
hemoglobin concentration during adenosine stress [7-10].
Oxygenation measurements using BOLD CMR have been
shown to be proportional to changes in coronary sinus
oxygen saturation, [7] and are affected in patients with
microvascular dysfunction as well [9]. Thus, compared to
perfusion, myocardial oxygenation may be a superior par￾ameter reflecting more directly the imbalance between
oxygen demand and supply that characterizes ischemia.
Previous studies have shown that the hypertrophied
heart such as in AS shows impaired myocardial energet￾ics demonstrated by a reduced ratio of phosphocreatine
to adenosine triphosphate (PCr/ATP) [11,12]. However
the relationship between oxygenation and myocardial
energy metabolism in AS has not been investigated yet.
31P magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy is a noninva￾sive technique that can be used to study myocardial en￾ergy metabolism in vivo.
Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to
comprehensively assess coronary microvascular status in
patients with severe AS and no obstructive CAD by asses￾sing myocardial perfusion and oxygenation during adeno￾sine stress. We hypothesized that tissue oxygenation and
perfusion during stress are impaired in severe AS and
correlate with myocardial energy metabolism and LV
contractile function. We also hypothesized that these
abnormalities are restored after aortic valve replacement
(AVR). If our hypotheses are proven true, it would suggest
a central role of myocardial ischemia in patients with severe
AS despite the absence of epicardial coronary stenoses.
Methods
Study population
Thirty-four patients with isolated severe AS were pro￾spectively recruited from the Oxford University Hospital
National Health Service Trust. Six patients were ex￾cluded (1 had HCM, 1 had poor LV function, 1 had se￾vere claustrophobia and 3 were unable to undergo
adenosine stress). Of the 28 patients, 3 patients were
asymptomatic and 25 had at least one of typical symp￾toms consistent with severe aortic valve stenosis (angina,
breathlessness or syncope). All patients had undergone
invasive coronary angiography, showing unobstructed
epicardial coronary arteries. Selection criteria included
an aortic valve area of ≤1.0 cm2
, peak gradient of
64 mmHg without other significant valvular pathology
based on clinical reports of echo performed as part of
routine clinical evaluation, systolic blood pressure (BP)
<160 mmHg and diastolic BP <90 mmHg. Patients who
had LVEF <50%, contraindications to MR imaging,
glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min, underlying cardio￾myopathy, previous myocardial infarction, coronary
revascularization or previous cardiac surgery were ex￾cluded. Of the 25 AS patients (symptomatic) who under￾went AVR, 14 were rescanned 8 months after AVR.
Eleven patients did not have a follow-up scan (2 died
perioperatively, 1 had pacemaker implantation, 5 were
lost to follow-up and 3 did not consent for a repeat
CMR). Fifteen healthy volunteers (defined by no history
of heart disease, diabetes, hypertension or high choles￾terol, not taking any medications, normal physical exam￾ination and electrocardiogram) served as controls.
Study protocol
All subjects underwent baseline CMR scanning on a 3
Tesla MR system (TIM Trio; Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen,
Germany) within 4–6 weeks of the routine clinical echo￾cardiogram. Fasting venous blood was drawn for blood
glucose and lipid profile. All subjects gave their informed
consent to participate in the study which was approved by
the National Research Ethics Service Committee South
Central - Berkshire.
Cardiac magnetic resonance protocol
Study participants were instructed to avoid caffeine￾containing food and drinks for at least 24 hours prior to
CMR. Cine imaging was performed using standard
methods [13]. Strain imaging was performed using myocar￾dial tagging sequence as previously described [14]. A short￾axis image at the mid ventricular level was acquired. 31P
MR spectroscopy was performed to obtain the PCr/ATP
ratio from a voxel placed in the midventricular septum,
with the subjects lying prone with their heart over the
centre of the 31P heart/liver coil in the iso-centre of the
magnet as previously described [15].
BOLD and stress perfusion CMR were performed as
previously described [16,17]. Briefly, adenosine (140 μg/kg/
min) was infused for at least 3 minutes, followed by acquisi￾tion of a single mid-ventricular slice (identical to the one
acquired at rest) of BOLD image. Then stress perfusion
imaging was performed immediately after stress BOLD
imaging, using a bolus a gadolinium-based contrast
(Gadodiamide, Omniscan; GEHealthcare) at a dose of
0.03 mmol/kg followed by a saline flush. After discontinu￾ing adenosine, rest perfusion images were acquired 20 mi￾nutes after the stress study to allow sufficient time for
contrast washout. Furthermore, after rest perfusion im￾aging, an additional bolus of 0.1 mmol/kg gadodiamide was
administered (total dose: 0.16 mmol/kg) for late gadolinium
enhancement (LGE) imaging. The LGE images were
acquired as previously described [18].

Cardiac magnetic resonance data analysis
Analysis of cardiac volumes, function and mass was per￾formed as previously described [13]. All analyses were
performed in a blinded fashion. Aortic valve area was
measured from direct planimetry during aortic valve
cine CMR. Information on the peak aortic valve gradient
was obtained from the clinical echocardiogram per￾formed during work-up for AVR. LV circumferential
strain was analysed by using CIM-Tag software (Auckland,
New Zealand) [19]. 31P MRS post processing analysis was
performed as previously described [15].
BOLD analysis was performed as described previously
[16]. In brief, myocardial SI was measured after manu￾ally tracing the endocardial and epicardial contours. The
mid-ventricular short-axis BOLD image was divided into
6 segments. Mean signal intensities were calculated for
resting and stress conditions by averaging signal mea￾surements from images during rest and adenosine stress,
respectively.
For perfusion analysis, briefly, 3 contours (epicardial,
endocardial and LV blood pool) were drawn on a single
image and propagated throughout the perfusion series.
The myocardium was divided into segments based on
the American Heart Association (AHA) segmentation
model. SI versus time curves were generated and nor￾malized to the LV blood pool upslope. Myocardial perfu￾sion reserve index (MPRI) was defined as the ratio of
stress to rest relative upslope [20].
LGE was only deemed to be present when the area of
contrast enhancement could be seen in both phase￾swapped images and in a cross-cut long-axis image. LGE
quantification was performed using cmr42 software (ver￾sion 4.0, Circle Cardiovascular Imaging). The full-width￾half-maximum (FWHM) technique was used to quantify
fibrosis as previously described [21]. Fibrosis volume
was expressed as the LGE mass (g) and also as a per￾centage of total myocardial mass.
Statistical analysis
All data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation and
checked for normality using Kolmogorov–Smirnov test.
Categorical data are presented as numbers and percent￾ages. Comparisons between the 2 groups were performed
by Student t-test. The chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test
was used to compare discrete data as appropriate. Bivari￾ate correlations were performed using Pearson’s or
Spearman’s method as appropriate. Comparisons between
pre- and post-AVR measurements in AS patients were
performed with two-tailed paired t-test. Comparisons be￾tween AS patients and controls at baseline and post-AVR
were performed using independent Student t-test or
Mann–Whitney U test as appropriate. A P-value <0.05
was considered significant. All statistical analyses were
performed with IBM SPSS Statistics, version 20.
Results
Baseline study characteristics
Demographic, clinical, echocardiographic and biochem￾ical data are shown in Table 1. All AS patients had both
AVA of ≤1.0 cm2 and peak gradient of ≥64 mmHg
based on echocardiogram performed as part of routine
clinical evaluation. The AS patients were slightly older
than the healthy volunteers but numerically the differ￾ence was small (69 vs. 63 years). There were no signifi￾cant differences in gender, body mass index, BP and
pulse rate between AS patients and normal controls.
Blood glucose and lipid parameters were also similar in
both groups.

Assessment of left ventricular mass, function, myocardial
fibrosis and energetics
The CMR results are summarized in Table 2. As ex￾pected, AS patients had significant LVH, reduced cir￾cumferential strain, high normal LVEF and reduced PCr/
ATP ratio when compared to the controls. LGE imaging
demonstrated that myocardial fibrosis was prevalent in
AS (79%) and none was found in the normal controls.
There was patchy mid-wall enhancement pattern affect￾ing predominantly the basal inferior and inferolateral
wall. None of the AS patients had any evidence of previ￾ous myocardial infarction on LGE imaging. By using the
FWHM method for LGE quantification, the burden of
LV fibrosis was high in AS, 33.2 g (17.1-61.8) or 19.7 ±
11.0% of total LV mass.
Assessment of myocardial perfusion reserve and
oxygenation under adenosine stress
During adenosine stress, there were equivalent rises in
rate pressure product (RPP) in both AS patients and
controls; baseline RPP 8.6 ± 1.6×103 (beats/min).mmHg
in AS vs 8.0 ± 1.5×103 (beats/min).mmHg in controls,
p = 0.27 and stress RPP 11.2 ± 2.5×103 (beats/min).mmHg
in AS vs 11.7 ± 2.6×103 (beats/min).mmHg in controls,
p = 0.55. Confirming previous CMR and PET studies [2,3],
myocardial perfusion reserve was significantly reduced in
AS patients compared to the healthy controls. Import￾antly, we now report that oxygenation is also substantially
reduced in AS patients compared to normal controls, as
shown in Table 2 and Figure 1.
Relationships amongst oxygenation, perfusion, strain
and energetics
In line with previous studies, we found that MPRI had
an inverse correlation with LVMI (r = −0.61, p < 0.001),
presence of LGE (Rs = −0.61, p < 0.001) but not with
LGE volume or LGE%, and a positive correlation with
AVA (r = 0.45, p = 0.02) [2,3]. Furthermore, we also
found that impaired MPRI was associated with blunting
of myocardial oxygenation during vasodilator stress (r =
0.52, p = 0.001), impaired strain (r = −0.59, p < 0.001)
and reduced PCr/ATP (r = 0.63, p < 0.001) (Figure 2).
Similar to perfusion, BOLD SI change had an inverse
correlation with LVMI (r = −0.39, p = 0.02), circumferen￾tial strain (r = −0.51, p = 0.001) and a positive correlation
with PCr/ATP (r = 0.47, p = 0.003), but no significant
correlation with presence of LGE, LGE volume or LGE%.
We also found that PCr/ATP ratio inversely correlated
with strain (r = −0.75, p < 0.001). LGE volume (g) also in￾creased with increasing LVMI (r = 0.72, p < 0.001).
CMR and spectroscopy post AVR
Results are summarized in Table 3 with an example
shown in Figure 3. In accordance with previous studies,
we confirmed significant improvements in perfusion
[22], LV strain [23] and energetics [24] after AVR. We
have now shown that there was also significant improve￾ment in oxygenation post AVR with no significant differ￾ence between the post-AVR levels and normal controls.
Although LGE volume (g) reduced following AVR, LGE%
of myocardium was similar to the baseline level. Thus, ab￾normalities in perfusion, LV strain, energetics and oxygen￾ation were all reversible on relief of LV overload and
hypertrophy regression.
We further explored the data by comparing the base￾line characteristics, severity of AS and CMR findings of
the AS patients with (n = 14) and without follow-up (n =
11). Patients who did not have follow-up CMR were older
than those who had follow-up CMR after AVR (73 vs. 65
years), in which the 3 patients who had perioperative com￾plications (2 deaths and 1 pacemaker implantation) were
among the oldest in that group. The rest of the baseline
characteristics and severity of AS were similar in both
groups (results not shown). The CMR indices of patients
without follow-up CMR scan, in particular BOLD SI
change (5.0 ± 11.2%), MPRI (0.9 ± 0.2), circumferential
strain (−16.0 ± 3.3%), PCr/ATP ratio (1.43 ± 0.25), LVMI
(90 ± 27 g/m2
), LVEF (74 ± 7%), LV mass (33.0 [18.5-
49.5]) and %LV mass (17.9 ± 6.8%) were also similar to
the CMR indices of the patients with follow-up scan,
all p > 0.05.

There are two main findings of this study. First, we dem￾onstrated that significant impairment in myocardial

perfusion and oxygenation response to vasodilator stress
in severe AS patients and normal epicardial coronaries,
which correlate with the degree of impairment in myo￾cardial energetics and contractility. Second, following
AVR, alterations in myocardial perfusion and oxygen￾ation are reversible along with improvements in energet￾ics and circumferential strain.
Myocardial perfusion and oxygenation in AS
Microvascular dysfunction is a well-established phenome￾non in pressure-overload LVH [25]. This can be due to de￾creased capillary density per unit myocardium due to
inadequate growth of new vessels and extravascular com￾pression as a result of increased LV wall stress [25,26]. We
demonstrate that hypoperfusion seen is severe enough to
be translated into a significantly blunted myocardial oxy￾genation response to stress. Not surprisingly, our data
show that the degree of impairment in perfusion reserve
correlates with the extent of hypertrophy, aortic valve
stenosis and myocardial fibrosis.
In the absence of obstructive CAD, the hypertrophied
ventricle is vulnerable to ischemia especially under stress
[26]. This is thought to be the explanation why patients
with AS have symptoms of effort angina despite normal
epicardial coronary arteries [27]. Whether de-oxygenation
occurs as a consequence of impaired perfusion reserve
during stress in AS has never been demonstrated previ￾ously. Myocardial hypoperfusion does not always reflect
hypoxia as oxygen demand may vary in different patho￾physiologic states. For example, in hypertension, myocar￾dial oxygen utilization per unit LV weight is reduced in
the presence of LVH [28]. Cardiac hypertrophy is an
adaptive mechanism in response to pressure overload, to
normalize increased wall stress according to the Law of
Laplace [29]. Our group recently demonstrated that dis￾sociation between myocardial perfusion and oxygenation
can exist [9,16,30]. Impaired stress perfusion can be com￾patible with normal oxygenation when myocardial oxygen
demand is down-regulated such as in hibernation [9,16],
and stress oxygenation can be reduced in spite of normal
perfusion, when the oxygen demand is increased such as
in HCM gene carriers [30]. Our current study now shows
that, in the context of AS, perfusion and oxygenation dur￾ing stress are closely associated, and both are impaired.
This is in line with observations in patients with LVH due
to long-standing hypertension [31]. We also showed that
both perfusion and oxygenation impairments in AS
showed significant associations with the degree of LVH.
Conversely, there was no significant relationship between
oxygenation and fibrosis, which is expected because scar
tissue has negligible oxygen requirements.
Relationships amongst myocardial perfusion/oxygenation,
energetics and contractility
Our results confirm the previous finding of reduced
PCr/ATP ratio in patients with severe AS [11,12]. We
now demonstrated that impaired perfusion reserve and
oxygenation correlate with impaired energetics and re￾duced circumferential strain. Impaired energetics is
likely to be due to microvascular dysfunction [24] or re￾duced total creatine [32], or both, as known to occur in
the hypertrophied heart. ATP is the direct energy fuel
for myocardial contraction whilst phosphocreatine is es￾sential for the transfer of high-energy phosphates from
Figure 1 BOLD SI change and MPRI in AS patients when compared to normal controls. Error bars represent standard deviation.

mitochondria to myofibrils. Whether the relationship be￾tween energetics and function in the hypertrophied and
failing heart is causal or coincidental is a highly complex
[33] and controversial [34], and our study cannot resolve
this.
Changes following aortic valve replacement
We showed that improvement in oxygenation 8 months
after AVR occurred in parallel with improvements in
stress perfusion [22], energetics [24] and LV strain [19].
This improvement in microcirculatory function after AVR
is most likely the result of a combination of both, relief of
mechanical obstruction with reduced LV wall stress, and
LVH regression [24,35]. Although there was significant
LGE volume reduction after AVR, LGE as a percentage of
myocardium did not change. It is likely that LGE reduc￾tion was related to LV mass regression as shown by posi￾tive correlation between LGE volume and LVMI in our
study. As gadolinium is confined to the extracellular
space, reduction in LGE may also indicate a reduction of
other elements of extracellular matrix and not due to col￾lagen reduction per se. Similarly, other studies have shown
no significant fibrosis regression post AVR using diffuse
equilibrium [36] and qualitative assessments [37].
Clinical implications
Our findings suggest that substantial microvascular dys￾function leading to myocardial tissue ischaemia during

vasodilator stress is present in severe AS without epicar￾dial CAD. A reduced capacity to augment myocardial
oxygenation during stress may contribute to poor clin￾ical outcome, as prognosis rapidly deteriorates after de￾velopment of symptoms such as angina and the onset of
LV dysfunction. Oxygenation-sensitive CMR together
with MR-spectroscopy provide a comprehensive insight
into the pathophysiology of ischaemia and metabolic de￾rangements in AS patients. Importantly, our findings
suggest a potential new avenue for therapy targeted at
improving microcirculation and reducing oxygen de￾mand, e.g. nitrates [38], calcium antagonists and beta￾blockers, or metabolic agents to improve efficiency of
energy utilization e.g. perhexiline [39].

Study limitations
We included a small number of AS patients with dia￾betes, hypertension and dyslipidaemia, which may con￾tribute to myocardial perfusion abnormalities. However,
only patients with well-controlled diabetes and BP were
included and the few patients who had dyslipidaemia
were well treated by statin. It would be challenging to
recruit patients with severe AS without any of these con￾ditions which are very common in the elderly popula￾tion. However, the reversibility of our findings after AVR
strongly suggests that our findings were not due to con￾comitant diseases. Although the present BOLD tech￾nique only acquired a single mid-ventricular slice, this
should not affect the result as left ventricular hyper￾trophy in AS is general. Our study demonstrates proof
of concept, and confirmation of our findings in larger
scale studies is warranted.
Conclusions
In severe AS without epicardial CAD, there is blunted
oxygenation response to adenosine stress suggestive of
microvascular impairment, which correlates with impaired
energetics and subclinical LV dysfunction. Myocardial per￾fusion, oxygenation, energetics and contractility are re￾stored following AVR. Oxygenation-sensitive CMR
provides pathophysiologic insight, may become a helpful
diagnostic tool, and suggests novel strategies for therapy
in AS aimed at improving the oxygen demand/supply
balance.
