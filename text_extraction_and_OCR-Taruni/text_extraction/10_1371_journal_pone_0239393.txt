Abstract
Background and aims
The national Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN) reported the major indi￾cation for liver transplants in 2018 was for other/unknown causes. This study was under￾taken to examine all causes and trends in liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
among adults who received liver transplants in the past 10 years.
Methods
A national cohort study of all adults who received liver transplants from Jan 1, 2010 to Dec
31, 2019 recorded in the OPTN STAR database analyzed by etiology of liver disease and
HCC, and gender.
Results
Adult liver transplants increased from 5,731 in 2010 to 8,345 in 2019 (45.6% increase).
Between 2010 and 2014, liver disease and HCC associated with hepatitis C (HCV) was the
major cause for liver transplantation. Proportion of liver transplants for HCV associated liver
disease and HCC has since decreased to 18.7% in 2019 compared with 44.5% in 2010
[25.8%, (95% CI 24.3% to 27.3%), p<0.001], while liver transplants for liver disease and
HCC associated with alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) and non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease (NAFLD) increased from 12.7% to 28.8% [16.1%, (95% CI 14.8% to 17.4%),
p<0.001], and from 9.1% to 21.5% [12.4%, (95% CI 11.2% to 13.5%), p<0.001], respec￾tively. When all causes of liver disease were examined, only 1.7% of liver transplants had
unspecified causes. The five major causes of liver disease and HCC among men receiving
liver transplants in 2019 were ALD (33.1%), HCV (21.9%), NAFLD (18.5%), cholestatic liver
disease (5.7%) and hepatitis B (4.9%), while the major causes among women were NAFLD
(26.8%), ALD (21.1%), HCV (13.1%), cholestatic liver disease (11.1%), and autoimmune
liver disease (5.6%).

Conclusions
Our study found NAFLD in 2017 in women and ALD in 2019 in men have surpassed HCV as
the leading causes of liver disease and HCC among adults receiving liver transplants.
Introduction
Although end stage liver disease and HCC caused by chronic hepatitis C have long been the
leading indications for liver transplantation in adults in the U.S. [1], recent studies highlighted
the increasing number of people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non￾HCV related alcohol associated liver disease (ALD) added onto the U.S. liver transplant wait￾ing list [2–5]. This trend has been attributed to the introduction of curative directing acting
antiviral treatment for hepatitis C, alcohol abuse, and the rising obesity epidemic in the coun￾try [6]. However, a complete analysis of all causes of liver disease and HCC among adult liver
transplant recipients in the U.S. has not been reported. In 2020, the Organ Procurement and
Transplant Network (OPTN) reported that the major indication for liver transplants in 2018
was for other/unknown causes [7], accounting for 33.9% of liver transplants. Although unsub￾stantiated, this has led to speculation that many in the other/unknown category represent
patients with NAFLD [8]. Liver transplants for HCC were also frequently reported as a sepa￾rate category and not under the liver disease causing HCC. This leads to an undercount of the
actual burden of the underlying etiology of liver disease treated by liver transplantation. The
purpose of this study is to conduct an in-depth analysis of all causes of liver disease and their
associated complications including HCC among liver transplants recipients from 2010 to
2019.
Materials and methods
The data for this analysis was obtained from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Net￾work (OPTN) STAR database, a national database operated by the United Network of Organ
Sharing (UNOS) under contract with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that
contains all the data in the U.S. on organ transplantation including waiting list, organ dona￾tion, and transplantation. All the data contained in the OPTN database are fully anonymized
and the authors had no access to any identifying information. The study cohort included all
the adult patients aged 18 years and older (66,719) who received liver transplants between Jan￾uary 1, 2010 and December 31, 2019. The causes of liver disease (S1 Table) were categorized by
combining the diagnoses entered into the database as primary and secondary diagnoses at ini￾tial waitlist registration, final diagnosis entered at time of transplant, and positive serology for
hepatitis B (hepatitis B surface antigen, HBsAg) and hepatitis C (hepatitis C antibody). When
there was more than one diagnosis, the cause of liver disease was categorized by prioritizing
the final diagnosis at time of transplant, then primary diagnosis at time of waitlist registration,
then secondary diagnosis at time of waitlist registration. The cause of liver disease was catego￾rized under HCV and hepatitis B if the patients were hepatitis C antibody positive and hepati￾tis B surface antigen positive, respectively. The etiology of HCC was based on the liver diseases
listed as primary or secondary diagnoses at waitlist, final diagnosis at time of transplant, and
serology for hepatitis B and C. HCC and cryptogenic cirrhosis were only listed as separate cate￾gories when there was no known associated liver disease. Recipients who had no diagnosis
information in the database were grouped under a category named ‘unspecified cause’.

Recipients were analyzed by gender to assess trends in liver transplants and whether there
were different disease burdens resulting in liver transplantation between men and women, and
BMI at time of waitlist registration to assess the potential effect of the obesity epidemic.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SAS v9.4 software. Differences between the propor￾tions of liver transplant performed each year for the various causes of liver disease compared
with 2010 were calculated using a Z-test for two proportions. P-values and related confidence
intervals (CIs) were reported accordingly. Linear regression analysis was conducted in SAS for
trend over ten years, and the p-values and parameter estimates were reported accordingly.
Results
Trends in etiology of liver disease and HCC among adult liver transplant
recipients from 2010 to 2019
The number of adult liver transplants per year has steadily increased from 5,731 in 2010 to
8,345 in 2019 (45.6% increase). Between 2010 and 2019, proportion of liver transplant recipi￾ents with BMI � 30 has increased from 37.0% to 40.8% [3.8%, (95% CI 2.2% to 5.4%),
p<0.001], and proportion of recipients with BMI � 35 has increased from 13.8% to 16.7%
[2.9%, (95% CI 1.7% to 4.1%), p<0.001] (Table 1).
Among adults who received liver transplants in 2019, the number and proportion of liver
transplants by etiology of liver disease and HCC in descending order of frequency were alco￾hol-associated liver disease (2,399 or 28.8%), NAFLD (1,795 or 21.5%), HCV (1,563 or 18.7%),
cholestatic liver disease (641 or 7.7%), hepatitis B with or without hepatitis C or hepatitis D
coinfection (355 or 4.3%), cryptogenic cirrhosis (259 or 3.1%), autoimmune liver disease (234
or 2.8%), metabolic liver disease (243 or 2.9%), acute hepatic necrosis unrelated to hepatitis B
or hepatitis C (169 or 2.1%), unspecified causes of HCC (132 or 1.6%), graft failure (142 or
1.7%), benign hepatic tumors (103 or 1.2%), non-HCC malignant liver tumors (93 or 1.1%),
Budd-Chiari syndrome (30 or 0.4%), miscellaneous causes (32 or 0.4%), and unspecified
causes (145 or 1.7%) (Table 1).
The proportion of liver transplants for hepatitis C has declined significantly. Although hep￾atitis C associated liver disease and HCC was the leading cause of liver transplants from 2010
to 2017, it dropped to number two behind alcohol associated liver disease in 2018 and to num￾ber three behind NAFLD among the most common causes of liver transplants in 2019.
Between 2010 and 2019, the proportion of liver transplants for hepatitis C associated liver dis￾ease and HCC declined by more than half from 44.5% to 18.7% [25.8%, (95% CI 24.3% to
27.3%), p<0.001].
During the same period, the proportions of liver transplants for liver disease and HCC
related to ALD and NAFLD have doubled from 12.7% to 28.8% [16.1%, (95% CI 14.8% to
17.4%), p<0.001], and from 9.1% to 21.5% [12.4%, (95% CI 11.2% to 13.5%), p<0.001],
respectively. Proportion of liver transplants for graft failure and benign hepatic tumors have
also increased from 0.2% to 1.7% [1.5%, (95% CI 1.2% to 1.8%), p<0.001] and from 0.7% to
1.2% [0.5%, (95% CI 0.2% to 0.8%), p = 0.003] respectively (Table 1).
Between 2010 and 2019, the proportions of liver transplants for hepatitis B associated liver
disease and HCC decreased from 5.7% to 4.3% [1.4%, (95% CI 0.7% to 2.2%), p<0.001], cryp￾togenic cirrhosis from 4.7% to 3.1% [1.6%, (95% CI 0.9% to 2.3%), p<0.001], acute hepatic
necrosis unrelated to hepatitis B or C from 3.1% to 2.1% [1.0%, (95% CI 0.5% to 1.6%),
p<0.001], and unspecified causes of liver disease or cirrhosis from 3% to 1.7% [1.3%, (95% CI

0.8% to 1.8%), p<0.001]. There were no changes in the proportion of liver transplants for liver
disease and HCC associated with cholestatic liver disease, autoimmune liver disease, metabolic
liver disease, unspecified causes of HCC, other malignant liver tumors, Budd-Chiari syn￾drome, and miscellaneous causes from 2010 to 2019 (Table 1).
In a linear regression analysis, the major changes in the trend in the causes of liver disease
and HCC among adult transplant recipients between 2010 and 2019 were proportions of liver
transplants for HCV (-2.98 [95% CI -3.85 to -2.11]), ALD (1.81 [95% CI 1.35 to 2.27]), and
NAFLD (1.49 [95% CI 1.28 to 1.70]) (Table 2). ALD (2.06 [95% CI 1.54 to 2.58]) showed a
greater increase in men relative to NAFLD (1.29 [95% CI 1.06 to 1.51]), while NAFLD (1.83

causes in 2019 in decreasing order of frequency were liver disease and HCC associated with
alcohol associated liver disease, hepatitis C, NAFLD, cholestatic liver disease and hepatitis B

Since 2019, alcohol associated liver disease and HCC have surpassed hepatitis C as the lead￾ing cause of liver disease among men who received liver transplants. Between 2010 and 2019,
the proportion of liver transplants for liver disease and HCC associated with ALD increased
from 14.5% to 33.1 [18.6%, (95% CI 16.9% to 20.3%), p<0.001]. Hepatitis C-related liver dis￾ease and HCC remained the second most common cause of liver transplant in men in 2019,
but it has dropped from 49.4% of liver transplants in 2010 to 21.9% in 2019 [27.5%, (95% CI
25.5% to 29.4%), p<0.001]. The proportion of liver transplants in men for liver disease and
HCC associated with NAFLD has also doubled from 7.6% to 18.5% [10.9%, (95% CI 9.5% to
12.2%), p<0.001], between 2010 and 2019. Liver transplants for hepatitis B-related liver disease

and HCC in men decreased from 6.7% to 4.9% [1.8%, (95% CI 0.8% to 2.8%), p<0.001]
between 2010 and 2019 (Table 3).
Trends in etiology of liver disease among women who received liver
transplants from 2010 to 2019
The number of women who received liver transplants increased from 1,962 in 2010 to 3,031 in
2019 (54.5% increase). In 2010, more women than men had BMI � 30 (38.8% vs 36.0%) [2.8%,
(95% CI 0.2% to 5.5%), p = 0.04] and BMI � 35 (16.5% vs 12.4%) [4.1%, (95% CI 2.2% to
6.1%), p<0.001]. By 2019, the percentage of women and men with BMI � 30 was the same
(41.5% vs 39.6%), but more women than men had BMI � 35 (18.4% vs 15.7%) [2.7%, (95% CI
1.0% to 4.4%), p = 0.002]. (Table 4)
Similar to the trend seen in men, there was a significant decrease in proportion of liver
transplants in women for hepatitis C-associated liver disease and HCC from 35% in 2010 to
13.1% in 2019 [21.9%, (95% CI 19.5% to 24.3%), p<0.001], whereas the proportions of liver
transplants for liver disease and HCC associated with NAFLD and ALD more than doubled
from 11.9% to 26.8% [14.9%, (95% CI 13.3% to 16.5%), p<0.001] and from9.2% to 21.1%
[11.9%, (95% CI 10.5% to 13.3%), p<0.001], respectively (Table 4). In 2017 NAFLD surpassed
hepatitis C as the leading cause of liver disease in women receiving liver transplants, and in
2019 alcohol-associated liver disease surpassed HCV to become the second major cause of
liver transplants in women. Among women who received liver transplants in 2019, the five
leading causes of liver disease in decreasing order of frequency were liver disease and HCC
associated with NAFLD, alcohol associated liver disease, hepatitis C, cholestatic liver disease,
and autoimmune liver disease (Table 4).
Etiology of HCC among adult liver transplant recipients between 2010 and
2019
From January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2019, 19,872 (31%) adult liver transplant recipients
were diagnosed with HCC (S3 Table). From 2010 to 2019, the proportion of transplant recipi￾ents with HCC decreased from 33% to 29% in men [4.3%, 95% CI (2.4% to 6.2%), p<0.001]
and from 20% to 15.5% in women [4.5%, 95% CI (2.9% to 6.1%), p<0.001]. Hepatitis C
remained the leading cause of HCC, although it has declined from 67.8% in 2010 to 43.8%
[24.0%, (95% CI 20.8% to 27.1%), p<0.001] in 2019. Liver transplants for HCC related to hepa￾titis B have seen no significant change. During the same period, liver transplants for HCC
related to NAFLD and alcohol associated liver disease have both increased from 5.0% to 18.8%
[13.8%, (95% CI 11.8% to 15.8%), p<0.001], and from 7.0% to 15.8% [8.8%, (95% CI 6.8% to
10.8%), p<0.001], respectively. Between 2010 and 2019, there were no significant changes in
the proportion of liver transplants for HCC related to cholestatic liver disease (1.9%), crypto￾genic cirrhosis (2.0%), autoimmune cirrhosis (1.0%), metabolic disease (1.0%), and Budd￾Chiari (0.2%) (Table 5).
When analyzed by gender, hepatitis C remained the leading cause of HCC in both men and
women who received liver transplants although it has dropped from 68.3% to 46.0% [22.3%,
(95% CI 18.7% to 25.9%), p<0.001] in men and from 66.4% to 36.7% [29.7%, (95% CI 23.2%
to 35.9%), p<0.001] in women between 2010 and 2019. In 2019, the second most common
cause of HCC was ALD in men (19%), but in women it was NAFLD (30%). In women, ALD
was not a common cause of HCC accounting for only 7.0% of liver transplants for HCC in
2019 (Table 5).

Discussion
The major indication for liver transplantation in 2018 was listed as other/unknown causes
(33.9%) in the 2020 Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN) Report [7]. But in
this study, when all causes of liver disease and HCC were examined by compiling all the diag￾nosis and HBV and HCV serologic data entries in the OPTN STAR database from time of ini￾tial waitlist registration to time of transplantation, we found only a very small proportion
(1.7%) of liver transplant in adults had unknown causes of liver disease in 2018 and 2019.
Our study found that although hepatitis C related liver disease and HCC was the leading
cause for liver transplants in the U.S. and accounted for half of liver transplants in men and a
third of the liver transplants in women between 2010 to 2014, there has been a dramatic and
sustained decline since then. Since 2010, the proportion of liver transplants for hepatitis C

associated complications including HCC has decreased by 33.2% in 2017 and 55.7% in 2019 in
men, and by 43.1% in 2017 and 62.6% in 2019 in women. The decline was even greater for hep￾atitis C without associated HCC (S4 Table). The declining numbers and proportions of liver
transplants for liver disease and HCC associated with hepatitis C is in concordance with the
reports of a similar decrease in proportion of patients with hepatitis C enrolled on the liver
transplant waitlist [5]. This decline in liver transplant for hepatitis C complication is contem￾poraneously associated with increased screening and the introduction of the highly effective,
curative direct acting antiviral therapies for hepatitis C [6]. There was also a decrease in the
proportion of liver transplants for liver disease and HCC related to hepatitis B between 2010
and 2019. This may, likewise, be attributed to antiviral therapy and screening programs for
chronic hepatitis B.
With the decline in liver transplants for HCV, the proportion of liver transplants for liver
disease and HCC associated with NAFLD has more than doubled from 7.6% to 18.5% in men,
and from 11.9% to 26.8% in women between 2010 and 2019. In 2017, NAFLD surpassed hepa￾titis C as the leading etiology of liver disease among women who received liver transplants and
remained the third most common etiology of liver disease among men who received liver
transplants. The increase in liver transplant for NAFLD is associated with a growing obesity
crisis [6]. Between 2010 and 2019, proportion of male transplant recipients who were severely
obese (BMI � 35) increased from 12.4% to 15.7%, and from 16.5% to 18.4% in women. Past
studies have suggested that many transplant recipients with cryptogenic cirrhosis may repre￾sent uncounted cases of NAFLD [9, 10] and should be included as a part of the NAFLD cohort.
We found among the 259 (3.1% of total) transplants for cryptogenic cirrhosis in 2019, only 32
(12.4%) recipients had a BMI � 35, and among the 145 (1.7% of total) transplants with unspec￾ified liver disease, only 6 (4.1%) had a BMI � 35. Therefore, they would be unlikely contribute
to a significant increase in cases of NAFLD. Liver transplants for liver disease and HCC associ￾ated with NAFLD will likely continue to grow as a result of the high prevalence of severe and
morbid obesity in the U.S. population. The CDC reported among adults living in the U.S.

between 2017–2018, the age adjusted prevalence of obesity in adults (BMI � 30) was 42.4%,
and 6.9% of men and 11.5% of women were morbidly obese (BMI � 40) [11].
While the proportion of liver transplants for hepatitis C has been declining, the proportion
of liver transplants for liver disease and HCC related to ALD has increased by 130% in both
men (from 14.5% to 33.1%) and women (from 9.2% to 21.1%) between 2010 and 2019. ALD
has become the leading indication for liver transplants in men and the second major indica￾tion for liver transplants in women in 2019. This trend is associated with the rising alcohol use
in the U.S. population [12, 13]. Although men are traditionally heavier drinkers than women,
alcohol consumption is rising in women as well. The National Epidemiologic Survey on Alco￾hol and Related Conditions reported increases in alcohol use especially among women in addi￾tion to older adults and racial/ethnic minorities [14, 15]. The increase in liver transplants for
ALD has also been attributed to broader acceptance of alcoholic liver disease for liver trans￾plants and the relaxation of the mandatory six-month abstinence period prior to transplanta￾tion by many transplant centers across the country [16]. Although our study included
transplant recipients with HCC or cirrhosis (without HCC) under the same underlying etiol￾ogy (Tables 1–3), a similar trend in liver transplants for HCV, ALD and NAFLD was found in
both recipients without HCC and recipients with HCC (S4 Table).
HCC is a common indication for liver transplantation, although it has declined from 33%
to 29% of the transplants in men, and from 20% to 15% among women who received liver
transplants between 2010 and 2019. Hepatitis C was the most common cause of HCC among
liver transplant recipients, but it has decreased from 68.3% to 46.0% in men and from 66.4% to
36.7% in women between 2010 and 2019. The proportion of liver transplants for HCC caused
by ALD has increased by 130% in men (from 8.2% to 18.5%) between 2010 and 2019, although
it remained a less common cause of HCC in women. Proportion of liver transplants for HCC
caused by NAFLD showed the greatest increase from 4.4% to 15.4% in men and from 6.9% to
29.7% in women between 2010 and 2019. Our findings are consistent with a recent study that
in the first quarter of 2019, NASH has surpassed HCV (including HCV+ALD) among women
with HCC on the liver transplant waitlist, but HCV remained the major etiology among men
with HCC on the liver transplant waitlist in 2019 [5]. Hepatitis B was the second most com￾mon cause of HCC in men and women in 2010, but has since dropped to fourth in men and
third in women.
Between 2010 and 2019, there was a decrease in the proportions of liver transplants for
acute hepatic necrosis (unrelated to hepatitis B or C), cryptogenic cirrhosis and in the category
of unspecified diagnosis. Although the reason for the decrease in acute hepatic necrosis is
unclear, the latter two decreasing trends likely reflect better diagnosis and coding entries into
the UNOS database. There were also increases in liver transplants for graft failure and benign
hepatic tumors that were not been previously reported. In the past 10 years, there were no sig￾nificant changes in the proportions of liver transplants for cholestatic liver disease, autoim￾mune liver disease, metabolic liver disease, unspecified causes of HCC, other malignant
tumors, Budd-Chiari, and in the several diseases we placed in the miscellaneous category.
From 2010 to 2019, about 75% of liver transplants in adults and 87% of liver transplants for
HCC each year were performed for complications of largely preventable or treatable causes
(hepatitis C and hepatitis B, alcohol associated liver disease, and NAFLD). A public health
response to improve awareness, prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment is much needed to
help to reduce and eliminate the burden of liver disease and HCC caused by these four dis￾eases. Hepatitis C is an example of what can be achieved through a national public health cam￾paign. Once the most common indication accounting for almost half of liver transplants each
year, the continued decline in the number and proportion of men and women transplanted or
on the transplant waitlist for hepatitis C demonstrates that with a national campaign to

increase hepatitis C screening and treatment, it is feasible to eliminate or reduce its complica￾tions and the need for transplantation. Continued declines in liver transplants for HCC related
complications can occur by implementing the 2020 US Preventive Services Task Force
(USPSTP) recommendations for universal screening, preventing new infections through harm
reduction and needle exchange, and widening access to direct acting antiviral treatment by
eliminating fibrosis restrictions [17–20]. Although a decrease in transplants for hepatitis B was
seen, there was no change in transplants for HCC associated with hepatitis B. The risks of hep￾atitis B progression to HCC and cirrhosis can likewise be combated through hepatitis B immu￾nization, public health campaigns to increase screening of at-risk populations including high
prevalence foreign-born persons (according to USPSTF recommendations), and long-term
disease monitoring and antiviral treatment [21–23]. The rising trend in liver transplants for
NAFLD and alcohol-associated liver disease is concerning. Since there is no targeted pharma￾cological treatment for NAFLD [24], public health campaigns to promote healthy eating and
exercise beginning from early childhood, and increased participation of healthcare providers
in obesity screening and behavioral counselling are necessary to decrease risk of NAFLD com￾plications [25–27]. Likewise, interventions to reduce alcohol consumption including aware￾ness campaigns and regulation of advertising and pricing, alcohol misuse screenings, and
clinical interventions [28] are needed to reduce the future burden of end stage liver disease
and HCC caused by alcohol associated liver disease.
Strength and limitations
While prior studies frequently reported HCC as a separate category and not under the liver dis￾ease that caused HCC or have focused on hepatitis C, NAFLD or ALD among patients on the
waitlist for liver transplant, this is the only study that analyzed all causes of liver disease and
HCC among adults who received liver transplants. The limitations of our study include that we
restricted our analysis to transplant recipients, so our study does not reflect overall numbers
and prevalence of these liver conditions among patients on the transplant waiting list. In addi￾tion, while we tried our best to categorize patients into disease categories, a small number of
patients where multiple conditions were present, we included them only under their primary
diagnosis. We are further limited by the accuracy of data entry and availability of information
recorded in the database–for instance we lacked information on metabolic syndrome and risk
factors of NAFLD. Despite these limitations, our study provides the first complete analysis of all
causes of liver disease among liver transplant recipients between 2010 and 2019.
Conclusions
When all causes of liver disease and HCC were examined, the proportion of liver transplants
for unspecified indications in 2019 was only 1.7%. About 75% of liver transplants in adults and
87% of liver transplants for HCC each year were performed for complications of largely pre￾ventable or treatable diseases (hepatitis C and B, alcohol associated liver disease and NAFLD),
underlying the importance of public health interventions in raising awareness, prevention,
early diagnosis and treatment to prevent disease progression to end stage liver disease and
HCC. The decline in liver transplantation for HCV demonstrates the feasibility to reduce the
burden of end stage liver disease caused by hepatitis C through an increase in screening and
treatment efforts.
