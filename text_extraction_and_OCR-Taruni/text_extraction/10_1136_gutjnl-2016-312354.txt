ABSTRACT
Objective Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is the
classical hepatobiliary manifestation of IBD. This clinical
association is linked pathologically to the recruitment of
mucosal T cells to the liver, via vascular adhesion protein
(VAP)-1-dependent enzyme activity. Our aim was to
examine the expression, function and enzymatic
activation of the ectoenzyme VAP-1 in patients with
PSC.
Design We examined VAP-1 expression in patients with
PSC, correlated levels with clinical characteristics and
determined the functional consequences of enzyme
activation by specific enzyme substrates on hepatic
endothelium.
Results The intrahepatic enzyme activity of VAP-1 was
elevated in PSC versus immune-mediated disease
controls and non-diseased liver (p<0.001). The adhesion
of gut-tropic α4β7+
lymphocytes to hepatic endothelial
cells in vitro under flow was attenuated by 50%
following administration of the VAP-1 inhibitor
semicarbazide (p<0.01). Of a number of natural VAP-1
substrates tested, cysteamine—which can be secreted by
inflamed colonic epithelium and gut bacteria—was the
most efficient (yielded the highest enzymatic rate) and
efficacious in its ability to induce expression of functional
mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 on hepatic
endothelium. In a prospectively evaluated patient cohort
with PSC, elevated serum soluble (s)VAP-1 levels
predicted poorer transplant-free survival for patients,
independently (HR: 3.85, p=0.003) and additively
(HR: 2.02, p=0.012) of the presence of liver cirrhosis.
Conclusions VAP-1 expression is increased in PSC,
facilitates adhesion of gut-tropic lymphocytes to liver
endothelium in a substrate-dependent manner, and
elevated levels of its circulating form predict clinical
outcome in patients.
INTRODUCTION
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a progressive
fibroinflammatory cholangiopathy strongly asso￾ciated with colonic IBD.1–3 This clinical phenotype
has generated several hypotheses linking
inflammation in the gut and liver, one of which
centres on aberrant lymphocyte homing.4 5
Ordinarily, the gut and liver harbour distinct endo￾thelial phenotypes, which provide a mechanism to
compartmentalise tissue-specific lymphocyte
Significance of this study
What is already known on this subject?
▸ Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is an
immune-mediated hepatobiliary disease
strongly associated with IBD, usually colitis.
▸ Under normal circumstances, expression of
mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule
(MAdCAM)-1 is restricted to the gut, but in PSC it
can also be found on hepatic endothelial cells,
where it is responsible for the recruitment of
mucosal effector α4β7 positive T-cells to the liver.
▸ We have recently shown that the aberrant
expression of MAdCAM-1 in PSC liver may
involve a combination of inflammation and
activation of the enzyme vascular adhesion
protein (VAP)-1, a potent amine oxidase.
What are the new findings?
▸ Hepatic VAP-1 enzyme activity is increased in
PSC compared with non-inflamed liver, and
expressed at a similar level to resected colon
from patients with colitis.
▸ VAP-1 can catabolise a diverse range of
substrates, with the most potent inducer of
enzyme activity being cysteamine—an amine
that can be released by the colonic epithelium
and enteric pathogens.
▸ The degree to which VAP-1 enzyme activity
facilitates the adhesion of α4β7 T-cells to
hepatic endothelium is substrate-dependent.
▸ Circulating soluble VAP-1 levels (sVAP-1) are
heightened in patients with PSC, correlate with
disease severity and can be used to
prospectively stratify clinical outcome.

recruitment.6 In the gut, expression of mucosal addressin cell
adhesion molecule (MAdCAM)-1 on mucosal endothelium is
responsible for recruiting intestinal lymphocytes that are
imprinted with tissue-specific tropism; specifically those which
express the MAdCAM-1 receptor, α4β7.7 Under normal circum￾stances, expression of MAdCAM-1 is restricted to the gut, but
in PSC can also be detected on hepatic endothelium where it
promotes recruitment of mucosal α4β7+T cells to the liver.8
The latter population are predominantly effector memory lym￾phocytes,8 9 which upon reactivation result in a T cell rich
portal infiltrate within the liver, and an iterative inflammatory
response therein.
The factors leading to aberrant expression of MAdCAM-1 in
PSC liver are not known, but may involve inflammation and
activation of vascular adhesion protein (VAP)-1,10 11 an adhe￾sion molecule that is also endowed with potent amine oxidase
activity. In humans, VAP-1 is constitutively expressed on the
hepatic endothelial surface,12 13 and through its catalytic func￾tion, VAP-1-mediated oxidation of methylamine can induce
MAdCAM-1 expression by endothelial cells.10 However,
VAP-1 is potentially capable of catabolising a diverse range of
substrates beyond methylamine; and it is plausible that in the
presence of enteric dysbiosis and/or an inflamed ‘leaky’ gut,14
increased portal vein amine levels lead to intrahepatic enzyme
activation, upregulated hepatic endothelial MAdCAM-1
expression and recruitment of mucosal effector T cells to the
liver.4 5
The aims of this study were to compare VAP-1 expression in
PSC to that observed in non-diseased liver, correlate serum
levels with patient characteristics and clinical outcome, and
determine the functional consequences of enzyme activation
through a divergent amine substrate panel.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Human tissue samples
Liver tissue was acquired during transplantation from patients
with chronic end-stage disease, and from healthy donor livers
surplus to requirements. Colonic tissue was procured via surgi￾cal resections in colitis refractory to medical treatment (UC),
and distal-to-tumour segments in non-colitis associated colonic
cancer (NC). All samples were obtained with Local Research
and Ethics Committee approval and informed patient consent
(Local Research and Ethics Committee Birmingham references:
2003/242, renewed 2012; and 06/Q2702/61).
Demonstration and quantification of VAP-1 in human tissue
Prior to determining VAP-1 expression in human liver, represen￾tative tissue sections were stained with Oil Red O (Sigma),
which stains neutral triglycerides and lipids. Steatosis was quan￾tified by the proportion of section area that stained positive for
dye as assessed by ImageJ analysis.15 16 Sections were only used
for study when 2% or less of the surface area stained positive,
indicating minimal or no excess steatosis.
Immunohistochemistry
Chromogenic staining was used to visualise VAP-1 in frozen liver
tissue and confocal microscopy to confirm cellular localisa￾tion12 17 (see online supplementary table S1). All immunohisto￾chemical sections were assessed by a specialist hepatopathologist.
Absolute quantification of VAP-1 mRNA
Quantification of VAP-1 mRNA expression in human liver was
assessed by qRT-PCR (see online supplementary table S2).
Given the absence of a single, known housekeeping gene exhi￾biting stability across all aetiologies and between varying stages
of human liver injury,18 19 mRNA expression was determined
by absolute quantification of samples. Briefly, copy number of
VAP-1 in matched amounts of starting total RNA from each
sample was measured via a calibration curve of known dilutions
of a linearised plasmid encoding the VAP-1 gene ranging from
10 copies/mL to 105 copies/mL, as previously described.12 All
starting mRNA concentrations were standardised and qRT-PCR
reactions performed using 100 ng starting material run in tripli￾cate wells.
VAP-1 enzyme assays
VAP-1 enzyme activity was determined in protein lysates from
liver and colon using Amplex-UltraRed Reagent as a stoichio￾metric fluorogenic substrate for horseradish peroxidase and by
quantifying the rate of H2O2 production during a deamination/
oxidation reaction (see online supplementary table S3).13 To
ensure all measured output was specific to VAP-1, test wells
were always run in parallel to identical samples containing the
urea derivative semicarbazide (250 mM; Sigma), which is a com￾plete inhibitor of VAP-1 activity.13 The value from
semicarbazide-treated samples was then subtracted from the
enzymatic rate in inhibitor-free wells.
Evaluating substrate-dependent variations in enzyme
kinetics
Putative, naturally occurring substrates of human VAP-1 were
selected based on inclusion in the human metabolome database
V.2.5 (http://www.hmdb.ca), and with reference to Shen et al,
20
specifically cysteamine, methylamine, dopamine, ethylamine and
phenethylamine (Sigma). A 96-well plate was loaded with 50 ng
recombinant VAP-1 (Biolegend) in 100 mL Dulbecco’s phosphate￾buffered saline with increasing concentrations of test substrate
supplemented to test wells. A H2O2 standard curve was created,
and enzyme activity quantified using the Amplex-UltraRed detec￾tion system across increasing concentrations of test substrate for a
fixed concentration of VAP-1 under atmospheric conditions.
Kinetic parameters were estimated by Michaelis-Menten method￾ology (see online supplementary figure 1). Benzylamine served as
an internal positive control.
Determining the consequences of VAP-1 activation
Hepatic endothelial cells (HEC) were extracted from whole
liver and grown till confluence as previously described.10 21
Significance of this study
How might it impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable
future?
▸ The ability of VAP-1 to catabolise amine substrates,
potentially secreted by gut epithelium or enteric pathogens,
provides a theoretical link between altered colonic
microbiota and mucosal immunity in PSC disease
pathogenesis.
▸ sVAP-1 represents a biologically linked, mechanistically
driven serum marker of clinical outcome in patients with
PSC.
▸ Modulating the recruitment of mucosal lymphocytes to the
liver by targeting VAP-1 highlights an avenue for therapeutic
exploration.

Cell-based ELISAs
An ELISA of cultured HEC (passage 3–4) was used to investi￾gate the expression of MAdCAM-1, following cell stimulation
with tumour necrosis factor (TNF)α (20 ng/mL; Peprotech, UK)
in the absence or presence of amine substrates at concentrations
yielding the maximum apparent enzymatic rate (Vmax
app ) (see
online supplementary file 1).
Flow-based adhesion assays
Flow-based adhesion assays were conducted to assess the func￾tional consequences of amine exposure and VAP-1 inhibition on
HEC-mediated lymphocyte recruitment, as described previ￾ously.10 21 Briefly, confluent monolayers of HEC were cultured
in microcapillary flow chamber microslides (Ibidi, Germany),
and stimulated with TNFα (20 ng/mL) ± amine substrate sup￾plemented HEC media, in the absence or presence of semicar￾bazide (250mM) (see online supplementary file 2).
To obtain purified CD3+ α4β7+ T cells, peripheral blood lym￾phocytes were subject to fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(MoFlo XDP High-Speed Cell Sorter in purity mode; Beckman
Coulter) (see online supplementary table S4). Isolated cells were
incubated overnight (Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium
+10% foetal calf serum in a 48-well culture plate; Corning
Costar) to facilitate recycling of surface receptors. The following
day, cells were washed, pelleted and viability confirmed by
Trypan blue exclusion, before being resuspended (106 cells/mL)
in serum-free basal endothelial media containing 0.1% bovine
serum albumin, ready for perfusion.
Quantification of circulating soluble VAP-1 in clinical samples
Soluble (s)VAP-1 values were quantified in human circulation
using a europium-coupled, time-resolved immunofluorometric
assay (see online supplementary table S5), and results validated
through a chemiluminescence detection technique as per Aalto
et al22 (see online supplementary file 3). Serum samples were
obtained from patients with PSC, primary biliary cholangitis/
PBC, autoimmune hepatitis/AIH, UC alone/UC and healthy
volunteers without evidence of liver disease or IBD. Notably, as
liver biopsy no longer forms routine standard of care in PSC or
PBC,23 in the absence of histological data, the presence of cir￾rhosis was identified according to a combination of clinical fea￾tures (ascites/varices/hepatic encephalopathy), laboratory indices
(hypoalbuminaemia/thrombocytopenia/prolonged international
normalised ratio) and radiology (coarse or irregular liver ±
reversed portal flow/splenomegaly/ascites).
Statistical analysis
Non-parametric data are presented using median and IQRs unless
otherwise specified. The Mann-Whitney test was conducted when
comparing continuous data between two independent groups,
and Kruskal-Wallis test (p<0.001) with Bonferroni-Dunn post
hoc correction for multiple groups. Non-parametric measures of
statistical dependence between continuous variables were con￾ducted using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient.
In prospective clinical outcome studies, time-zero was set as
the point of blood sampling, and the primary endpoint defined
as transplant-free survival; patients without a clinical event were
censored at date of last clinic follow-up. The impact of continu￾ous variables on clinical endpoints was evaluated by receiver
operator characteristic curve analysis, and an optimal cutpoint
selected (Youden Index) from a derivation cohort (Birmingham,
UK) before being tested in a validation series of patients (Oslo,
Norway). Cox proportional hazards models were fit to assess
the impact of individual covariates on the instantaneous rate of
events, with time-to-event analysis ascertained through
Kaplan-Meier estimates (SPSS V.21; IBM, USA).
RESULTS
VAP-1 expression is altered in PSC liver
In non-diseased liver, VAP-1 expression as shown by immuno￾histochemistry was largely confined to the walls of blood vessels
and the hepatic sinusoids, with the latter being most evident in
centrilobular regions (see online supplementary figure 2A–C).
VAP-1 expression was increased in immune-mediated liver
disease, including PSC, wherein sinusoidal staining was present
throughout cirrhotic nodules (see online supplementary figure
2D) (see online supplementary figure 3).
We have previously shown that VAP-1 is expressed by HEC, in
addition to α smooth muscle actin (αSMA) hepatic stellate cells
and activated myofibroblasts in cirrhosis.12 To this effect, strong
VAP-1 expression was seen in the fibrous septa and the walls of
portal/septal vessels in PSC liver (see online supplementary figure
2E–F). Confocal immunofluorescence confirmed VAP-1 colocali￾sation with αSMA in the walls of portal/septal vessels and stromal
cells within fibrous septa (see online supplementary figure 4).
VAP-1 staining in portal/septal vessels was present in close prox￾imity to CD31+ endothelial cells lining these vessels (see online
supplementary figure 5), as previously described.12 Conversely,
VAP-1 did not colocalise with EpCAM+ bile ducts or proliferat￾ing bile ductules in PSC liver (see online supplementary figure 6).
To quantify the level of hepatic VAP-1 expression, gene tran￾scription was measured using qRT-PCR on cDNA derived from
human liver tissue. Levels of VAP-1 mRNA were significantly
greater in diseased versus non-diseased liver explants, with the
highest levels seen in PSC (p=0.003) (see online supplementary
figure 7).
VAP-1 enzyme activity is increased in PSC liver
Consistent with immunohistochemical staining patterns and
qRT-PCR, we found that VAP-1 enzyme activity was elevated in
PSC versus normal liver (p<0.001) (figure 1A). Given the clin￾ical association with IBD, VAP-1 enzyme activity was also
assessed in resected colonic tissue. Levels in UC were similar to
those of PSC liver and greater than that in non-inflamed human
colon (figure 1B).
VAP-1 enzyme activity supports the adhesion of α4β7+
lymphocytes to HEC
It has previously been demonstrated that VAP-1 enzyme activity
enhances MAdCAM-1-dependent binding of an α4β7-expres￾sing β-lymphoblastoid cell line to HEC.10 We now show that
highly purified α4β7+ T cells isolated from peripheral blood
(see online supplementary figure 8) also undergo adhesion to
hepatic endothelium on which VAP-1 enzyme activity is acti￾vated by the model substrate methylamine (figure 2). This
process was inhibited by approximately 50% with the selective
VAP-1 enzyme inhibitor semicarbazide, although no significant
differences in the proportion of cells undergoing transmigration
were seen. These findings are consistent with the role of
MAdCAM-1/α4β7 in the lymphocyte recruitment cascade where
they support adherence but not transmigration.10
VAP-1 enzymatic activity is substrate-dependent
To profile the enzymatic rate following provision of other natur￾ally occurring substrates, the amine oxidase activity of a fixed
amount of purified VAP-1 was quantified across increasing sub￾strate concentrations until the apparent maximum saturating

enzyme activity was reached (Vmax
app ), and the resulting kinetic
rates measured (figure 3A). Following a series of dose-finding
studies and by approximating Michaelis-Menten constants, we
were able to develop a hierarchy of substrates based on enzym￾atic efficiency (kcat
app/KM
app) with the highest rate seen for cystea￾mine (see online supplementary table S6). This was of particular
interest given that cysteamine can be generated by the colonic
epithelium and induce colitis,24–30 and also by bacteria asso￾ciated with enteric dysbiosis in PSC-IBD.14
A cell-based ELISA was then used to measure the impact on
MAdCAM-1 induction in response to varying substrate provi￾sion (figure 3B). Again, cysteamine was shown to be the most
potent of all amines tested, resulting in significantly higher
MAdCAM-1 expression by HEC than methylamine and dopa￾mine (another potent VAP-1 substrate). All experiments were
carried out in the presence of TNFα to mimic local inflamma￾tion.21 31–34 Moreover, cysteamine-stimulated HEC supported
adhesion of α4β7+ T cells under flow to a significantly greater
degree than that observed with methylamine at matched concen￾trations (figure 3C), suggesting that as a substrate, cysteamine is
also associated with greatest VAP-1 efficacy.
Circulating soluble VAP-1 levels are elevated in the sera of
patients with PSC
In addition to its expression within the liver, VAP-1 can be
released into the circulation in soluble form (sVAP-1).35 The
hepatic vasculature is an important source of sVAP-1, and we
have recently shown that it is also released by activated hepatic
stellate cells and liver myofibroblasts—key cellular mediators of
tissue fibrosis.12 We measured serum sVAP-1 in a cohort of
patients under active follow-up using an immunofluorescence
ELISA (table 1), and found higher values in those with PSC
(n=134; 532 ng/mL, IQR 432–668 ng/mL) compared with AIH
(n=97; 433 ng/mL, IQR 355–548 ng/mL), PBC (n=48; 470 ng/
mL, IQR 374–653 ng/mL), healthy control subjects (n=54;
425 ng/mL, IQR 336–466 ng/mL) and patients with colitis
alone (n=50; 413 ng/mL, IQR 348–489 ng/mL) (figure 4A,B).
A greater number of patients with PSC displayed features of
established cirrhosis, together with an increased number of clin￾ical events over time compared with our PBC and AIH groups.
In light of this observation, we then stratified our autoimmune
liver disease cohort according to elevated sVAP-1 values, via
dichotomisation at the median for the overall cohort (cut-off:

485 ng/mL). To this effect, PSC retained a significant association
with heightened sVAP-1 independently of the presence of liver
cirrhosis (adjusted OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.10 to 3.14; p=0.021).
sVAP-1 is associated with disease severity and predictive of
clinical outcome
When patients with PSC were studied in more detail, elevated
values were seen particularly in those with cirrhosis compared
with non-cirrhotic individuals, but with no statistically signifi￾cant differences between compensated versus decompensated
disease (figure 4C,D) (table 2).
Having identified an association with indices of advanced
disease, the ability of sVAP-1 to predict clinically significant end￾points was evaluated prospectively. In the Birmingham deriv￾ation cohort, 51 patients underwent liver transplantation or
sustained a liver-related death (n=44 and n=7, respectively),
yielding an incidence rate of 19.7 clinical events per 100
patient-years. Survival analysis was restricted to those patients
not listed for liver transplantation at time of sampling and with
a minimum 3-month follow-up (n=104; median event-free sur￾vival from time of serum sampling: 39.0 months, IQR 32.1–
45.9 months, figure 5A), in which the prognostic value of
sVAP-1 was evident on a continuous scale (see online
supplementary figure 9A). An optimal cutpoint of 529 ng/mL
was determined via the Youden Index method and shown to strat￾ify clinical outcome (HR: 3.76, 1.68–8.47, p=0.001) (figure 5B)
independent of other risk predictors on multivariable analysis
(adjusted HR: 3.85, 1.68–8.47, p=0.003) (table 3).
Given that liver cirrhosis and sVAP-1 levels exhibited a signifi￾cant statistical interaction (p<0.01), the additive predictive
value of the latter was then assessed exclusively in a subset of
patients with PSC who already had advanced liver disease.
Despite this restriction, elevated sVAP-1 levels were still able to
stratify the subgroup of cirrhotic patients with PSC at highest
risk of liver transplantation/death (HR: 2.02, 1.17–3.51,
p=0.012) (figure 5C). Reciprocally, elevated sVAP-1 values dis￾criminated the risk of poorer clinical outcome in patient groups
having a normal serum bilirubin, a normal serum albumin and/
or a normal platelet count (see online supplementary figure 10).
Validation of sVAP-1 as a biomarker for patients with PSC
To substantiate the findings of clinical outcome studies, we
quantified sVAP-1 levels using a second, independent detection
system (chemiluminescence), and showed strong correlation

between both techniques (see online supplementary figure 11).
Moreover, when applying the chemiluminescence assay, serum
sVAP-1 values retained predictive value of transplant-free sur￾vival in our derivation cohort (see online supplementary figure
9B), with an optimum cutpoint of 923 ng/mL. Patients with a
chemiluminescence-derived sVAP-1 concentration above this
value carried a significantly increased risk of future clinical
events (HR: 5.10, 1.95–13.34, p=0.001).
Next, we obtained serum samples from an external PSC
cohort from Oslo (Norway), in an attempt to validate the bio￾marker potential of sVAP-1. Patient characteristics and compari￾son against the Birmingham derivation cohort are provided in
online supplementary table S7. As such, elevated serum sVAP-1
in the validation cohort also associated with significantly poorer
transplant-free survival (see online supplementary figure 12),
characterising a group at high risk of disease progression (HR:
3.06, 1.39–6.78, p=0.006).
DISCUSSION
The results of our study indicate that in PSC, expression and
enzyme activity of VAP-1 are increased in the liver, which is
reflected by increased circulating soluble levels. These findings
have important implications for understanding disease patho￾genesis, because we subsequently show how activation of VAP-1
on hepatic endothelium increases the ability to recruit α4β7+ T
cells from blood that were originally activated in the gut.
Because pathophysiological substrates for VAP-1 are not known,
we also studied a range of natural amines in their ability to
induce enzyme activation. In so doing, we found that the most
potent substrate is cysteamine which has been shown to induce
colitis and colonic cancer in mice;27–30 an intestinal phenotype
mirrored clinically in patients with PSC.1–3 Furthermore, cystea￾mine when administered to hepatic endothelium resulted in
increased MAdCAM-1 expression and an enhanced ability to
recruit α4β7+ cells under flow. This lymphocytic phenotype
defines a mucosa-activated, effector memory cell population,
which are known to be recruited to PSC liver consequent to
aberrant endothelial expression of MAdCAM-1.8
Whether amine substrates are generated locally or delivered
from the gut via portal circulation can only be speculated.
Unfortunately, measuring amine levels in human tissue or serum
is hampered by rapid amine oxidation, amine volatility and pro￾longed derivatisation times that preclude analysis in the clinical
setting.36 37 Nevertheless we have recently shown how
mucosa-adherent microbiota in PSC are distinct, with an enrich￾ment of the genus Escherichia.
14 The latter are known to
produce cysteamine in vitro, as can the potentially oncogenic
genus Enterobacter.
20 38–40 Cysteamine may also derive directly
from the intestinal epithelium, through the activity of the
ectoenzyme vanin-1.41 Vanin-1 mediates cysteamine release in
the gut, and the introduction of cysteamine promotes colonic
inflammation and carcinogenesis in vivo.

risk in human PSC. Moreover, the aldehyde by-product of

cysteamine deamination is 3-mercaptopropionaldehyde, which
is associated with abnormal collagen crosslinking and a potential
contributor to fibrogenesis in chronic liver disease.42 However,
there are no reports of cysteamine being generated within
human liver itself.
Although hepatic VAP-1 expression was increased in all
immune-mediated liver diseases, this was marked in PSC and
mirrored by heightened amine oxidase activity. Notably, hepatic
enzyme activity in PSC was similar to that seen in the colon in
IBD, and it is plausible that upregulated colonic and hepatic
VAP-1 expression may have evolved to cope with an increased
burden of amines generated during intestinal inflammation. In
such a model, colonic dysbiosis could activate mucosal immune
responses leading to colitis, and an increase in amine release
from both bacteria and the inflamed epithelium. These sub￾strates when released into the portal vein would enter the liver
and activate VAP-1, modulating the expression of adhesion
molecules on the hepatic endothelium.5 Thus, our data put
forward a novel pathway through which colonic inflammation
and amine release may lead to liver damage, providing further
links between IBD and PSC. In support of this paradigm,
mucosa-adherent bacteria in PSC have been shown to be distinct
from those found in patients with IBD alone and normal,
healthy colon.14 43–46
Taken together with our previously published data, we
hypothesise that VAP-1 expression is critical during multiple
stages of PSC pathogenesis. In early disease, VAP-1 expression
would be increased on hepatic vessels in an effort to catabolise
the increased burden of amine substrates delivered via the portal
circulation from an inflamed gut. The resultant increase in
amine oxidase activity would drive upregulation of endothelial
adhesion molecules (including MAdCAM-1), fostering recruit￾ment of α4β7+ mucosal lymphocytes and leading to a proin￾flammatory response within the liver. Additionally, the increased
expression we observe in fibrous septa and αSMA-positive cells
suggest a broader role in advanced liver disease that may not be
aetiology-specific, rather characterising a more generalised
process contributing to tissue fibrogenesis.12
We also found that circulating sVAP-1 concentrations in
patients with PSC were elevated versus those with IBD alone
and healthy control subjects, and levels were also heightened
when compared with patients with PBC and AIH. However, the
variation between patients with autoimmune liver disease may
reflect a more advanced stage of liver injury in our PSC cohort
rather than a true aetiology-specific difference. Indeed, a large
proportion of patients with PSC had evidence of cirrhosis at
time of serum sampling, with a greater clinical event rate
observed during follow-up compared with other immune￾Figure 4 Correlation of serum vascular adhesion protein-1 (sVAP-1) levels with disease severity in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). (A)

mediated liver diseases. While we used multivariable statistical
analysis to adjust for the presence of liver cirrhosis, it would be
incorrect to presume that heightened sVAP-1 levels are a feature
unique to PSC, and similar caveats apply to other proposed bio￾markers.47 48 Notably, sVAP-1 levels were highest in the cir￾rhotic PSC subgroup and correlated with certain indices of liver
disease severity. This observation is important, for elevated
sVAP-1 has also been described in patients with non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease, predominantly those with a more advanced
stage of fibrosis,12 although prognostic utility in a dedicated
clinical outcomes’ analysis was not evident in this cohort.
Serum bilirubin and albumin are recognised clinical correlates
of liver cirrhosis, and their predictive value in forecasting clin￾ical outcomes in PSC is well described.49 These findings were
validated in the present study, in addition to recurrent ascending
cholangitis, elevated serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and
the presence of liver cirrhosis being identified as further prog￾nostic factors. Moreover, we found that circulating sVAP-1 levels
independently predicted transplant-free survival in a prospective
series of patients even when restricting analysis to those with cir￾rhosis, and reciprocally in individuals with a serum bilirubin,
serum albumin and/or circulating platelet count within the
normal range. This observation suggests that sVAP-1, while not
aetiology-specific per se, represents a biologically driven and
mechanistically linked surrogate of clinical outcome that can be
applied to patients with PSC with an already advanced liver
disease stage, in addition to those harbouring normal synthetic
function.

Serum sVAP-1 concentrations were determined using two sep￾arate techniques applying different internal protein standards.
Although the values we obtain show strong intrasample correl￾ation between methods, levels were generally greater when
assayed via chemiluminescence. Such variation between techni￾ques is well recognised in clinical practice,50–53 and future work
exploring the predictive utility of sVAP-1 cut-offs in PSC and
other chronic liver diseases must be mindful of the analytical
method applied. As with any newly proposed biomarker,
sVAP-1 also requires validation across larger cohorts, with inter￾nationally agreed protein standard preparation and reference
ranges set at population level. Moreover, to truly interrogate
aetiology-specific differences in VAP-1 expression and soluble
circulating levels, prospective large-scale collaboration is neces￾sary, with enough statistical power to facilitate propensity score￾matched analysis specifically for disease severity.54 Equally, it is

important for future studies to establish when in the clinical
course hepatic VAP-1 expression becomes increased, and the
point at which circulating serum levels discriminate high-risk
versus low-risk patient groups. Our study carries a further limi￾tation in this regard, given that experiments with liver tissue
were restricted to organs retrieved at transplantation, hence
already afflicted with end-stage cirrhosis. However, as liver
biopsy is not part of routine clinical care in PSC, access to fresh/
frozen tissue from early stage/non-cirrhotic patients (although
desirable) is rarely feasible for research purposes. Finally, the
proposed hypothesis wherein hepatobiliary disease is driven by
enteric dysbiosis and dysregulated mucosal immune responses is
restricted by the fact that not all patients with PSC manifest clin￾ically overt colitis; and conversely, not all individuals with intes￾tinal inflammation go on to develop liver injury.
In summary, we demonstrate that hepatic VAP-1 enzymatic
activity is increased in PSC, capable of supporting the recruit￾ment of mucosal α4β7+ lymphocytes to the liver, and deter￾mined by potentially gut-derived substrates such as cysteamine.
Moreover, serum VAP-1 values correlate with disease severity
and are predictive of outcome in PSC, providing utility for risk
stratification in clinical practice.55 Given its role in mediating
α4β7/MAdCAM-1 interactions, VAP-1 may also represent a
future therapeutic target, which would modulate the trafficking
of lymphocytes from the inflamed gut to the liver, and poten￾tially impact fibrogenesis.4 5 12 These pleiotropic mechanisms
may explain how targeting VAP-1 carries additional benefit com￾pared with α4 inhibition seen in murine models,56 and also over
other strategies affecting lymphocyte recruitment more broadly,
though with deleterious side effects.57
