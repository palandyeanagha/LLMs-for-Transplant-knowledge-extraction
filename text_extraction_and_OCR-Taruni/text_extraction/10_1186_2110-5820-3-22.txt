Abstract
In the context of worldwide increasing antimicrobial resistance, good antimicrobial prescribing in more needed
than ever; unfortunately, information available to clinicians often are insufficient to rely on. Biomarkers might
provide help for decision-making and improve antibiotic management. The purpose of this expert panel review
was to examine currently available literature on the potential role of biomarkers to improve antimicrobial
prescribing, by answering three questions: 1) Which are the biomarkers available for this purpose?; 2) What is their
potential role in the initiation of antibiotic therapy?; and 3) What is their role in the decision to stop antibiotic
therapy? To answer these questions, studies reviewed were limited to recent clinical studies (<15 years), involving a
substantial number of patients (>50) and restricted to controlled trials and meta-analyses for answering questions 2
and 3. With regard to the first question concerning routinely available biomarkers, which might be useful for
antibiotic management of acute infections, these are currently limited to C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin
(PCT). Other promising biomarkers that may prove useful in the near future but need to undergo more extensive
clinical testing include sTREM-1, suPAR, ProADM, and Presepsin. New approaches to biomarkers of infections include
point-of-care testing and genomics.

Review
Introduction
Good antibiotic prescribing-which often means less
prescribing-is of major concern to physicians nowadays,
both because of high levels of antibiotic consumption in
hospitals, and of the increasing prevalence of antimi￾crobial resistance, even if rates of methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus have decreased recently in many
European countries since the early 2000s. The principal
objective of antibiotic prescribing is to ensure appro￾priate therapy when needed, while avoiding unnecessary
or unduly prolonged therapy. Within this framework,
obtaining adequate microbiological information is of
paramount importance; unfortunately, such information
is lacking in more than 50% of clinical situations where
antibiotic therapy is prescribed, even in hospitalized pa￾tients. Whereas clinical information is usually sufficient
to initiate empiric therapy, they lack accuracy to tailor
subsequent therapy and decide on its duration. Physi￾cians’ decisions would be strengthened if they could get
help from results of accurate biomarkers reflecting the
diagnosis or evolution of the infectious processes. The

field of infection-associated biomarkers has grown rapidly
within the past few years and is still expanding; few of
them, however, have gone through the hurdles of rigorous
testing in the clinical arena to allow specifying their role
in clinical practice.
An 18-member expert panel convened under the aus￾pices of the Maurice Rapin Institute, a not-for-profit inde￾pendent physicians’ association (http://www.institutmauri
cerapin.org), to provide a state-of-the-art assessment of
the currently available biomarkers and their potential role
as an aid to the management of antibiotic therapy for
acute infections. This report is a summary of their work
and conclusions.
To frame the appraisal of the potential clinical role of
biomarkers, the panel was asked to answer three forma￾tted questions, as follows:
1. Which are the currently available biomarkers of the
host’s response, those that are routinely available
and which may contribute to the management of
antibiotics in acute infections, and what are the
limitations to the interpretation of their results in
this context?
2. What is the potential contribution of such
biomarkers to the initial decision of antibiotic
prescription, and does this vary according to the
characteristics of infection (i.e., site of infection,
comorbidities, mode of acquisition, severity of
presentation)?
3. When can biomarkers help make decisions to stop
antibiotic therapy, and which factors mitigate their
clinical use in this process?
The panel discussion was based on an analysis of the
available literature through December 2012, after mak￾ing the a priori decision to limit publications considered
for answering questions 2 and 3 to clinical studies fulfill￾ing the following criteria:
– Having enrolled a minimum of a substantial number
of patients (i.e., >50 patients);
– Performed within less than 15 years (i.e., published
since 2000);
– Pertaining to biomarkers available for routine testing
in hospitals’ laboratories.
The first part of this paper deals with the first question
asked to the panel, and the second part deals with ques￾tions 2 and 3.
Currently available biomarkers of the host
Definition and role of a host’s biomarker
Biomarkers from the host can be anatomical, physiological,
biochemical (either circulating or membrane-bound), or
molecular markers. The latter two categories are detected
within a tissue or biological fluid (e.g., blood, cerebrospinal
fluid, or urine) and their presence or absence, or over- vs.
under-expression is the judgment criteria. Of note, more
than 90% currently available biomarkers are used only
within research program and have not been introduced
within the field of clinical biology.
Definitions
Currently accepted definitions for biomarkers have emerged
from an expert panel driven by the U.S. National Institute
of Health [1] and from regulatory definitions issued by the
European Medicines Agency. A biomarker is “a biological
characteristic, objectively measured (i.e., with acceptable
accuracy and reproducibility) and used as an indicator for
a physiological or pathological process, or of the activity
of a medicine.” According to the NIH panel [1,2], bio￾markers can be stratified in two categories (Table 1): prog￾nostic markers, allowing to stratify patients according to
their individual risk of having a specified outcome, in￾dependently of therapy (or of the lack of therapy), and
predictive markers, which allow to predict the potential
benefit (efficacy) and/or the risks (toxicity) of a therapy
according to the biomarker status (absent/present).
In clinical practice, two types of biomarkers can be
identified, which follow different development and valid￾ation pathways:
– Those used independently from a specific therapy,
as a diagnostic test, or for follow-up or prognosis,
which will only be discussed in this paper from the
viewpoint of infectious processes;
– Those used as a companion to treatment, to select
patients who may benefit from a specific therapy or
used during follow-up of therapy as early predictors
of efficacy or of treatment toxicity.
The ideal biomarker in infectious diseases
Within the field of infectious diseases, a biomarker may
be used for identifying a high risk group or predisposing

condition, as an aid to identification of the disease, or to
direct therapy and stratify patients according to their
specific risk factors, and/or as an aid to therapeutic
management in order to avoid relapse of infection. An
ideal biomarker for infection would combine diagnostic,
prognostic, and follow-up of therapy characteristics and
should be easily and rapidly available for routine clinical
use (Table 2).
Potential role of biomarkers in acute infections:
performance measurements
Biomarkers are expected to provide an assessment of the
severity of infection or predict a complicated course to
help making a decision on the best therapeutic approach
and appropriate site of care (i.e., hospital or ambulatory
care, intensive or ward care). Foremost, they should help
the physician to decide about introducing or maintaining
antibiotic therapy.
Within the recent years, dozens of potential biomarkers
of infection have been described, and their analysis is a
complex task. Current trends are to use a combination of
biomarkers—notably cytokines—with multiplex tests pro￾viding simultaneous measurements of several biomarkers
from a single biological sample. The major point is to
examine whether their clinical performance and utility
can be transposed to acute care situations.
The diagnostic performance of biomarkers is usually
measured in terms of sensitivity (probability of a positive
test among affected patients), specificity (probability of a
negative test in unaffected patients), and by likelihood ra￾tios and area under the ROC (Receiver Operating Charac￾teristics) curves. Ideally, a biomarker would be both highly
sensitive and specific; however, very sensitive tests provide
few false-negative results, whereas highly specific ones
provide few false-positive results. In emergency medicine
practice, more emphasis is usually put on sensitivity (and
negative predictive value, NPV), as the primary objective
is to rule out the disease, whereas specificity (or positive
predictive value, PPV) is emphasized when the objective is
to confirm a clinical diagnosis. For quantitative tests,
establishing ROC curves allows to select the best com￾promise between sensitivity and specificity of the test,
according to which approach is emphasized. When a low
threshold for positivity of the test is selected, its sensitivity
increases but its specificity is lowered.
Sensitivity and specificity are however defined within
a population where the patients’ status (“infected” or
“noninfected”) is known, which does not corresponds to
the population seen by the physician in his routine clinical
practice. The clinical utility of a biomarker is therefore
best assessed by measuring its predictive values (both
positive and negative, PPV and NPV) and changes
between pre- and post-test likelihood ratios in a given
clinical context.
Two important points, often overlooked in the litera￾ture, should be considered when assessing the operating
characteristics of biomarkers:
– The characteristics of the population studied and of
the “control group” (i.e., noninfected). For example,
it is quite different to analyse a group of patients
with a systemic inflammatory response (SIRS)
following cardiac surgery (where the severity and
prevalence of infection is low) or patients with SIRS
within the context of pancreatitis evolving since >1
week, and both the severity and prevalence of
infection are higher, with a high clinical impact of
diagnosing infected pancreatitis necrosis.
– Criteria used as the “gold standard” for defining
infection (or lack thereof ) [4,5].
Limitations to the interpretation of biomarker levels
Improved measurement methods have largely enhanced
the potential for biomarkers to identify patients at high
risk of death or a complicated course, whether individual
patients or the general population. Nevertheless, persisting
difficulties arise when interpreting measurements of bio￾marker levels, a problem that is compounded by the dis￾semination of multiplex tests [6], thus increasing the
volume of information generated. For some biomarkers, a

threshold value can be determined, which allows a simple
binary interpretation, but inevitably results in loss of pre￾cision; however, this approach cannot be generalised.
Interpreting biomarker levels can be problematic be￾cause of the variability of measurements resulting from
several factors:
– A lack of standardisation between different methods,
– Biological factors, including preanalytical variables
(tubes and transport media, time from sampling to
analysis, etc.), analytical (precision, reproducibility,
threshold of measurement, etc.), and intra- or
interindividual variations; such factors must be
assessed and controlled for before providing an
interpretation of assays results.
In addition, prudent interpretation is mandatory when
the known sensitivity or specificity of the biomarker
measured is <90% or when the number of subjects stud￾ied is small. Moreover, in many studies, a single point in
time has been obtained for biomarker measurement, and
the lack of repeated measurements does not allow the
use of such marker for adapting the duration of therapy.
We conclude that standardisation of measurement
methods and guideline for the interpretation of bio￾marker levels in acute infections is mandatory before
introducing their measurements into clinical practice.
This development phase, including the determination of
associated quality criteria (i.e., reproducibility and vari￾ation coefficient, threshold for detection), identification
of confounding factors and corrective factors must be
investigated. Finally, medico-economic evaluation is usu￾ally lacking and should be performed before proposing
their introduction into routine clinical use.
Biomarkers currently available for optimising antibiotic
therapy
More than a hundred biomarkers have been studied in
the serum of septic patients [7-9]. Few of them however
are eligible for entering the clinical arena (see Additional
file 1: Table S1) and being used for optimising antibiotic
therapy because of limitations to the interpretation of
results from these studies. Assays used often are not
standardised (especially for ELISA and “multiplex” tests),
making it difficult to compare results from different
studies. Some techniques are difficult to adapt to the
emergency context (multiplex tests, ELISA or high-flux
cytometry). Some biomarkers cannot be presently re￾tained because of a poor performance, of studies limited
to a small population (e.g., <50 patients) or too scarce to
allow conclusions on their potential utility. A limited
number of biomarkers are currently of established or po￾tential clinical interest within the field of acute infection.
Routinely available biomarkers
Two biomarkers fulfill the selection criteria mentioned
above and are routinely available: C-Reactive protein
(CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT). CRP has been tested in
various conditions, but only a few of these studies have fo￾cused on its use for optimising antibiotic therapy. A single,
prospective, randomized, controlled trial performed in the
1990s in children is available [10]; other studies have com￾pared an intervention group to historical controls [11,12].
Despite the few available studies confirming its usefulness,
CRP measurements are widely used in children to adjust
the duration of therapy. Several studies are ongoing, test￾ing the usefulness of CRP measurements as an aid to
shorten the duration of therapy in adult patients having
sepsis, community-acquired pneumonia or exacerbation
of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Pend￾ing results from these studies, the use of CRP cannot be
recommended at present as an aid to the initiation or dis￾continuation of antibiotics in adults; in children, however,
CRP can probably be used to help discontinuing therapy,
although the evidence is limited.
Procalcitonin has been more widely tested for opti￾mising antibiotic therapy in both children and adults. In
adults presenting with community-acquired lower respi￾ratory tract infections (LRTI), several randomized, con￾trolled trials (RCTs) have tested the use of PCT as an aid
to the initiation and/or discontinuation of antibiotics and
have been summarised in a recent individual patient
meta-analysis [13-17]. Four of these studies enrolled more
than 900 patients hospitalised in intensive care or high￾dependency units [18-21]. Two well-designed studies have
been performed in children: one study included 121 neo￾nates having early sepsis [22] and another studied 384
children aged 1 to 36 months with acute fever of undeter￾mined origin (Manzano, Bailey et al. 2010; Esposito,
Tagliabue et al. 2011).
In view of these studies, the inclusion of PCT mea￾surements within decision algorithms of antibiotic man￾agement for specific infections is likely appropriate
(refer to Part II). However, further studies are needed in
infections which have been insufficiently examined so
far (i.e., most infections other than LRTI) to better de￾fine the role of PCT in the antibiotic strategy.
Recent biomarkers of potential interest in the near future
Intensive efforts are being made in the search of new diag￾nostic and prognostic biomarkers, which may be helpful
for the management of antibiotic therapy in acute infec￾tions. In adults, four of these, the soluble Triggering
Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1),
Soluble urokinase-type Plasminogen receptor (suPAR),
proadrenomedullin (ProADM), and Presepsin appear
promising. These four biomarkers are of reasonably easy
access, have demonstrated acceptable sensitivity and/or
Dupuy et al. Annals of Intensive Care 2013, 3:22 Page 4 of 8
http://www.annalsofintensivecare.com/content/3/1/22

specificity, and have been studied in a substantial num￾ber of patients to merit further consideration in adults.
In children or neonates, too few and heterogeneous
studies have been conducted with these new biomarkers
to allow recommending any of these for potential intro￾duction in the clinical arena at the present time; further
studies are needed in these age groups.
sTREM-1 A member of the immunoglobulin superfamily,
TREM-1 is a surface receptor of mature polymorpho￾nuclear and monocytes cells contributing to innate im￾munity. Its expression is up-regulated when phagocytic
cells are exposed to bacterial and fungal pathogens, but
not during other non-septic inflammatory processes.
TREM-1 amplifies the inflammatory response by increas￾ing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines while
inhibiting IL-10 synthesis. During up-regulation of the
surface receptor TREM-1, the soluble form sTREM-1 in￾creases in biological fluids (blood, broncho-alveolar lavage
fluid, CSF), where it can be assayed by ELISA using com￾mercial immunoassay kits.
Several clinical studies [23-29] have tested the diagnostic
and prognostic value of sTREM-1 (Table 3). Measure￾ments in samples taken at the site of infection (CSF, BAL,
pleural fluid) appear of higher clinical significance than
plasma measurements.
suPAR suPAR (soluble urokinase-type plasminogen acti￾vator receptor) or CD87 is a widespread receptor for in￾flammatory response. Its constitutive expression is limited
to some cell types, such as endothelium and leucocytes
(polymorphonuclear, monocytes/macrophages). Its gene
expression is under control of immune and inflammatory
effectors, such as bacterial products (LPS), cytokines
(IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-1-beta), and growth factors
(FGF-2, VEGF, TGF-beta, EGF). During the inflammatory
and immune response, the expression of suPAR is up￾regulated on epithelial cells, leucocytes (lymphocytes),
smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts; it also is up-regulated
during tumour growth and metastatic tumour dissemi￾nation. Measurements can be obtained from commercial
ELISA kits; suPAR measurements also are included in
multiplex assays together with cytokines.
suPAR is of limited value as a diagnostic test. Its clin￾ical value appears associated with its ability to identify
patients at risk (Table 4) and might be of interest for the
management of HIV patients receiving antiretroviral
therapy [30], during the follow-up of patients who have
nonpulmonary mycobacterial infection [31] and in chil￾dren who have Plasmodium falciparum malaria [32].
suPAR also might be useful for the management of anti￾biotics in patients with sepsis [33-35], but this approach
needs more extensive evaluation.
Pro-ADM Adrenomedullin (ADM) is a 52-amino acids
peptide, and a marker of the CALC gene family, acting
as a mediator of cell proliferation, hormone regulation
and embryogenesis. ADM is produced by endothelial
cells, where it induces vasodilatation and maintains ho￾meostasis. Pro-hormone fragments (pro-ADM) are more
stable than the complete peptide and their levels can be
measured in biological fluids by automated methods
using the TRACE (Time-Resolved Amplified Cryptate
Emission) method after immuno-capture. ProADM se￾cretion increases during the immune response to viral or
bacterial products in relation to the importance of the
stimulation.
Pro-ADM is a biomarker of prognostic value (Table 5).

ADM could be used to identify the more severe patients
for close monitoring and/or needing ICU care [37-40].
Presepsin Presepsin (formerly CD14), is a glycoprotein
receptor occurring at the surface of monocytes/macro￾phages. CD14 binds to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) complexes
and LPS binding protein (LPB), which triggers the activa￾tion of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), resulting in the produc￾tion of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines. Following
Presepsin activation by bacterial products, the CD14 com￾plex is released in the circulation as its soluble form
(sCD14), which in turn is cleaved by a plasma protease to
generate a sCD14 fragment called sCD14-subtype (sCD14-
ST). Plasma levels of sCD14 can be measured using an au￾tomated chemo-luminescent assay (PATHFASTW, IngenW,
France).
The most recent of the 4 biomarkers analysed, pre￾sepsin is both sensitive and specific and might be helpful
to differentiate SIRS from sepsis associated with a bac￾terial infection [41-43] (Table 6).
We conclude that information gathered so far on these
four biomarkers— sTREM-1, suPAR, proADM, and pre￾sepsin—suggest that they may have a role in future clin￾ical developments, whether as diagnostic tests, or for
stratification of patients by type of insult or severity, or
to assess the therapeutic activity and efficacy and during
follow-up of patients. To date, there are too few studies
of the impact of these new biomarkers on the antibiotic
management of patients and larger studies are required
in this field.
Future developments
Micro-RNAs (miR) are recently discovered potential
candidate biomarkers. miR are small molecules (about
20 nucleotides) present in eucaryotic cells, which act as
biologic regulators by modulating posttranscriptional
regulation. They are ubiquitous and abound in the lung,
liver, and kidney. After binding the corresponding smRNA
sequence, they regulate gene expression by a repressor ef￾fect or by altering its target. A mi-RNA can bind to several
smRNA. Their expression can be measured by RT-PCR
and quantitative PCR.
Their multiple potential roles in positive or negative
regulation of gene expression have been uncovered
since the early 2000s, and dysfunctions of miR expres￾sion have been implicated in numerous human diseases
(http://www.miR2Disease.org/), such as various types of
cancers (“oncomir”), cardiomyopathy, or central nervous
system diseases. miR also have been implicated in defense
mechanisms against viral infections, where they may con￾tribute to controlling viral infections. Integrated in the
viral genome, a number of miR can regulate viral mRNA
such as Epstein-Barr, cytomegalovirus, herpes, hepatitis
C virus as well as the host’s RNA. Among bacterial
infections, a role for miR has been suggested in M. tu￾berculosis infections by modulating the monocytes/mac￾rophages interactions with the bacterium or regulating
the expression of resistance gene or virulence factors.
Modulation of the inflammatory response to infection
with H. pylori also has been attributed to miR [44], not￾ably miR-155 [45].
The spectrum of miRNAs initially released in blood
and leucocytes of patients with septic shock differs from
that of control patients. The three most dysregulated
miR are miR-150, miR-182, miR-342-5p; miR-150 inter￾feres with the development of an immune response by
lymphocytes and thus might be a potential candidate as
an early diagnostic and/or prognostic marker [46].
Other miRNAs have been associated with a high prob￾ability of a poor outcome in patients with septic shock:
miR-223, miR-15a, miR-16, miR-122, miR-193*, and miR￾483-5p. Based on individual AUROC for each miR, pre￾diction of death varied between 0.61 (95% confidence
interval (CI) 0.523-0.697) and 0.79 (95% CI 0.719-0.861)
but reached 0.953 (95% CI 0.923-0.983) when combining
the seven parameters [47].
Thus, miR might be potential candidates as early diag￾nostic and/or prognostic markers in sepsis. Numerous
studies are needed with these new markers to better
understand their role in biochemical and immunobiology
processes in humans before their use for diagnostic and
stratification of patients, prognostication, or therapeutic
decision can be considered.
Two main technological advances are in progress, in￾cluding 1) the development of point-of-care testing, with
the availability of miniaturised and portable machines,
allowing rapid testing at the bedside, even for sophis￾ticated measurements (e.g., flux cytometry), which have
been confined to specialised laboratories up to recently;
and 2) the development of new methods, including the
analysis of gene expression (genomics), of ARN activation
(transcriptome), of production of proteins (proteomics), of
lipids (lipidomics), or of metabolites (metabolomics). It is
likely that these progresses will allow identifying new
markers for better identification of patients, stratification
of prognosis, and targeting therapy.
