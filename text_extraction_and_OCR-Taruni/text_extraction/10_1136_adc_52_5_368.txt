SUMMARY 105 babies with neonatal hepatitis were studied carefully and followed for up to 11 years.
Ascertainment was complete for those with severe and persistent jaundice, but less complete for
mild or anicteric cases. Prognosis was found to be poor (40% death or cirrhosis) in babies with
persistently acholic stools, but relatively good (<15% death or cirrhosis) in those with jaundice
which was less persistent and less obstructive. The presence of second diseases (including o1-anti￾trypsin deficiency or a family history of other affected children) seemed to play a part in determining
poor prognosis. A distinctive group of babies (22 cases) presented with acute fulminant illness (with
or without jaundice) in the neonatal period. Cytomegalovirus infection carried a relatively good
prognosis. Guidelines for selection of patients for therapeutic trials are suggested.
Debate has raged for many years about the prognosis
of neonatal hepatitis (NNH) and about the factors
which may affect the prognosis adversely.
Unfortunately very few facts have been available
as a basis for this debate. This paper presents some
pertinent facts gathered from an 1 1i-year prospective
study including almost all babies with neonatal
liver disease born in the State of Victoria in this
period.
Materials and methods
Case ascertainment has been described (Danks
et al., 1977) and is thought to be nearly complete
for severe cases of NNH in Victoria from 1 July
1963 to 31 December 1974. Some mild cases must
have escaped detection. A very broad definition
of NNH was used (Danks et al., 1977), based
upon microscopical changes in the liver (Smith
et al., 1977) in 88 patients. 17 babies with particularly
typical clinical features were included without
biopsy support for the diagnosis. Babies whose
symptoms could not be dated to an onset before
4 weeks of age were excluded (14 babies with onset
between 5 and 8 weeks were excluded).
Intrahepatic biliary atresia (IHBA) (Longmire,
1964; Alagille et al., 1975) posed problems because
it can be distinguished from NNH only by the
clinical and pathological course. The outcome of
Received 31 August 1976
IHBA has been shown for comparison with NNH
in Table 1, and the IHBA cases have been included
when looking at the effects of surgery upon
prognosis. There were 105 babies with NNH and
11 with IHBA in the study.
Follow-up was achieved as part of clinical care
in most cases, but a few babies treated by other
paediatricians were reviewed at longer intervals.
Further biopsies were performed in babies with
persisting clinical abnormalities and in babies
whose early biopsies showed fibrosis or severe
damage. Almost all babies were followed to 1974
or to earlier death. Necropsy was performed in all
who died, but one.
Children whose biopsies had never shown
significant fibrosis were classed as 'clinically normal'
if growth and development were within normal
limits and if there were no clinical or biochemical
abnormalities. Babies who were healthy but less
than 2 years old were regarded as 'too young to
assess' the prognosis. All other patients were
rebiopsied and classified according to the biopsy
result.
The term 'obstructive' is used to describe babies
whose stools remained clinically acholic for more
than 4 weeks. 'Partially obstructive' indicates
passage of stools which were pale but not acholic,
or passage of acholic stools for a shorter period
of time. Babies whose stools were always normal
in colour are described as having 'nonobstructive'
jaundice.

Results
The outcome of the whole group of patients
with NNH and IHBA is shown in the first columns
of Table 1. It is immediately apparent that NNH
is a serious disease with 30% mortality. The 5
patients with cirrhosis and about half of the 10 with
persisting inflammation may eventually die of their
disease, bringing the final mortality as high as 40 %.
Aetiological factors. It is apparent in Table 1 that
the large group of patients in whom no definite
aetiological factor was identified contributed heavily
to the mortality, and that those families containing
several babies with NNH contributed especially
heavily. Deaths after 3 months of age were confined
to these two categories, which also contributed
two-thirds of the early deaths. Most of the remaining
early deaths were caused by identified acute viral
infections.
The one patient who died of galactosaemia was
diagnosed only at necropsy (Oberklaid et al., 1976).
Only 1 of the 8 a1-antitrypsin (a1AT) deficient babies
has died, and 3 seem to have made such good
clinical recovery that biopsy was not performed.
The sister of one of the patients in this group
presented with NNH in 1956 and is now clinically
and biochemically normal at 19 years of age,
despite a Pi ZZ genotype. Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
appeared to carry a relatively good prognosis.
Progression to cirrhosis and later death due to
liver failure were seen mainly in familial cases
and in those with a proven second disease-x1AT
deficiency in 2, Aagenaes's syndrome in 1, an affected
sib in 2 cases (with consanguinity in one family),
superadded postnatal CMV infection in 1, Niemann￾Pick disease in 1, and polycystic kidneys in
another. A second factor was present in 7 of the
13 babies in whom progressive liver disease
developed.
Clinical categories. The type of jaundice influenced
the outcome greatly. Most of the 22 early deaths
occurred in patients with nonobstructive jaundice
and in patients who were never jaundiced at all.
14 of these babies died in the first month and most
of these presented with an overwhelming systemic
illness in which jaundice was a late or insignificant
feature. An infective cause was found in some,
but no cause was identified in the majority.
Most of the babies with jaundice of a non￾obstructive type (or no jaundice) who survived
the first month made a complete recovery (20 of
22 babies). One baby died at 4 months of progressive
liver disease, cerebral degeneration, and haemolytic
anaemia-his parents were first cousins and a sib
died of liver failure on the first day of life. Only one
baby has developed cirrhosis-an HBsAg positive
baby born to a drug addict.
On the other hand, those babies with persistent
obstructive jaundice had a very poor prognosis.
Only 4 of 16 babies have recovered fully, and an
eventual mortality of 60-75 % seems likely.
Most of the patients with partially obstructive
features made good progress after the newborn
period. 3 of the 4 babies who died early had other
serious abnormalities (Down's syndrome 2 and
multiple major malformations 1), so only 1 death
in this category can really be attributed to the
liver disease. Eventual mortality in this group
seems unlikely to exceed 15 %.
Finally, an attempt was made to study the effects
of operative diagnostic procedures upon prognosis,
especially upon progression to cirrhosis (Table 2).

From 1963 to 1966 babies with obstructive jaundice
had operative cholangiography under general
anaesthesia, and needle liver biopsy was performed
under general anaesthesia in those with less
obstructive clinical features. After 1966, needle
biopsy using local anaesthesia replaced both
procedures and very few operations have been
performed on babies with NNH (Danks, 1977).
It is apparent that the obstructive cases have done
badly whichever procedure was used, and that
needle biopsy under general anaesthesia had no
harmful effect on babies with partially obstructive
jaundice.
Discussion
Neonatal hepatitis is a serious disease. However,
it is obvious that it is not one disease (Danks et al.,
1977) and it is therefore important to look at the
effect of aetiology upon prognosis. It is also vital
to consider whether biases of ascertainment may
be exaggerating the seriousness of the outcome.
This study has ascertained 100% of babies with
severe and prolonged obstructive jaundice in the
State of Victoria. Consequently it is possible to
say with complete confidence that this form of
NNH carries a very serious prognosis. This fact
has been recognized before and there has been a
tendency to attribute this to operative intervention
in the management of these patients (Thaler and
Gellis, 1968). The analyses presented in this study
appear to refute this suggestion and blame the
poor outcome upon the disease itself.
Ascertainment is much more difficult to assess
in those patients with NNH who have minimal
jaundice or no jaundice. Some patients run a
rapidly lethal course in the first few weeks of life.
Unfortunately the number of babies in the
community who suffer anicteric NNH is unknown
and it is therefore impossible to describe the
prognosis of this class of disease accurately.
Arguments advanced elsewhere (Danks et al.,
1977) suggest that mild anicteric NNH is very
common. If this is true, acute fulminant lethal
illness may not be much more common than in
older patients. However, it is important to remember
that acute fulminant NNH can present in the
newborn period as an illness mimicking septicaemia,
without significant jaundice. Some of these patients
might possibly survive with intensive supportive
therapy, which has been rarely tried in this age
group. Our own experience is limited to one
published and unsuccessful attempt (Danks, 1974)
and 2 recent babies treated with repeated exchange
transfusions, one of whom made a complete
recovery.

Prognosis of babies with neonatal hepatitis 371
The majority of babies with NNH present at
3 or 4 weeks of age because of persisting jaundice
with stools that are paler than normal, but not
acholic. The prognosis in this group of patients
is good. The most interesting point is that patients
in whom multiple possible aetiological factors
can be shown seem more likely to progress to
chronic liver disease. Second disease processes
are remarkably frequent in babies with NNH
and may act by rendering some babies unduly
susceptible to the effects of some common infective
agent or agents (Danks et al., 1977). This hypothesis
could be extended to suggest that some second
disease processes may also increase the risk of
persistent liver damage. The hypothesis is important
because treatment of one of the multiple aetiological
factors may allow the natural healing processes
to deal with the remaining untreatable aetiological
factors. Several patients in the series started to
recover well and then suffered a second infective
illness (CMV 2, tuberculosis 1) after which relentless
progression to liver failure ensued.
This line of reasoning leads one to search for
any treatable components in the aetiology.
Obstructive jaundice is more severe and persistent
in NNH than in hepatitis in older patients. A
relationship to the different metabolism of bile
salts in the newborn may exist and trials of
treatments directed to reducing the bile salt levels
seem warranted, e.g. with phenobarbitone and/or
cholestyramine. Liver copper content can reach
very high levels in some of these patients (Reed
et al., 1972) and reduction with penicillamine may
have a beneficial effect, which may make the
difference between progressive disease and healing
in some patients.
Whatever methods of treatment are chosen, it
is apparent that the group of patients with severe
obstructive features would be the best to choose
for a therapeutic trial. The prognosis is so bad that a
good effect would become obvious even in an
uncontrolled study and one could easily justify
using forms of treatment which carry some risk of
side effects. On the other hand, the spontaneous
recovery rate in the less obstructive cases is so good
that it would be very difficult to show an effect
of any therapy. The rapidly fulminant cases vary
so much from one to another that therapy would
be extremely difficult to assess. This has been the
experience even in adults in whom diagnosis is
much easier.
Serum bilirubin levels, serum transaminase
levels, growth patterns, and other clinical parameters
were examined for prognostic significance and
none proved useful. A careful study of the liver
biopsies indicated that widening of the portal

tracts with proliferation of bile ducts was a poor
prognostic feature (Smith et al., 1977). This finding
correlated strongly with the severe obstructive
features seen clinically and this combination
should warn the clinician to be very guarded
regarding prognosis.

care of patients with obstructive jaundice, the
laboratory workers who performed biochemical
tests and cultured viruses during this long study,
