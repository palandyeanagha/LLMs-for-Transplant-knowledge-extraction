Percutaneous nephrostomy is a well-established and safe
technique used for urinary diversion in the renal transplant
population. Renal transplant nephrostomy is often technical￾ly straightforward due to the superficial location of a trans￾plant kidney. Occasionally, variable anatomy and comorbidity
of the patient population results in a wider range of potential
risks and complications. Traversal of bowel is one such
complication, the management of which can be very chal￾lenging. This article describes such a complication and its
management.
Case Report
A 59-year-old woman with a renal transplant 12 years previ￾ously underwent a nephrostomy tube placement 7 years later
(5 years prior to presentation). She presented to interven￾tional radiology for definitive management of intermittent
watery diarrhea, possibly containing urine. An unenhanced
computed tomography (CT) was performed revealing a trans￾cecal nephrostomy tube with a nephroenteric fistula
(►Fig. 1).
A nephrostogram was performed via the existing trans￾cecal nephrostomy catheter to better define the anatomy of
the nephroenteric fistula. Subsequently, using sonographic
and fluoroscopic guidance, a 21-gauge AccuStick needle
(Boston Scientific, Natick, MA) was advanced into a posterior
inferior calyx of the transplanted kidney from a lateral
approach away from overlying bowel. The needle was ex￾changed over a guidewire for serial dilators, and an 8F
nephrostomy tube (Cook, Bloomington, IN) was inserted in
standard fashion. A nephrostogram was performed, demon￾strating the catheter to be in an intrarenal position with
hydronephrosis due to long-standing ureteral occlusion
(►Fig. 2).
The patient’s previously placed 8F transcecal nephrostomy
tube was exchanged over a J-wire for a 6F vascular sheath.
Maintaining wire access, a tractogram was performed
through the sheath, demonstrating a large-caliber channel
of communication between a dilated calyx and the cecum.
Tandem guidewires were then placed through the sheath into
both the cecum and transplant kidney (►Fig. 3). A 6F cecos￾tomy catheter (pigtail catheter) was advanced over the wire
and positioned within the cecum (►Fig. 4). The vascular
sheath was advanced into the dilated calyx over the second
guidewire, and using fluoroscopic guidance and tactile feed￾back a 12-mm Amplatzer plug (SJM, AGA Medical, St. Paul,
MN) was deployed across the fistula (►Fig. 5). The right
nephrostomy and cecostomy tubes were secured in standard
fashion (►Figs. 6 and 7). The patient tolerated the procedure
well without immediate complications.
A 2-month follow-up examination revealed no communi￾cation between the cecostomy tube and the nephrostomy
tube (►Fig. 8). The cecostomy tube was removed after
cecostomy tractogram confirmed the presence of a mature
tract. Follow-up CT examination 4 months later confirmed
appropriate positioning of the Amplatzer plug within the
renal parenchyma (►Fig. 9). The patient has since been
asymptomatic over a 5-month follow-up period.
Discussion
Complications related to percutaneous nephrostomy tube
placement are well documented in both native and trans￾planted kidneys. The most common complications include
bleeding, infection, and collecting system injury.1 Rarely,
bowel interposed between the kidney and the needle entry
point may lead to transenteric nephrostomy tube placement
though the colon (native kidney and renal transplant pop￾ulations) or small bowel (renal transplant populations).2
Transenteric nephrostomy tube placement has historically
been managed conservatively by placement of a new percu￾taneous nephrostomy tube (or internal ureteral stent) and
conversion of the transenteric nephrostomy into a colostomy
tube.3 This management allows for continued decompression
of the kidney while minimizing flow through the nephroen￾teric fistula to facilitate closure; this strategy also allows the
assessment of drainage adequacy and monitors for develop￾ing infection or abscess formation.1 The colostomy tube

should also be left in place long enough to allow maturation of
the colostomy tract.4
In the patient presented here, the transenteric nephros￾tomy tube had been in place for several years and the maturity
of the nephroenteric fistula and robust urinous diarrhea
ultimately precluded conservative management. The patient
was a poor surgical candidate, and the decision was made to
place an Amplatzer plug within the renal parenchymal por￾tion of the fistula to limit or ideally prevent flow through the

nephroenteric fistula, thus encouraging preferential drainage
through the nephrostomy tube.
The Amplatzer vascular plug used in this procedure is a
self-expanding plug made of a Nitinol wire mesh attached to a
135-cm-long pusher wire; platinum marker bands aid in
fluoroscopic visualization. The Amplatzer vascular plugs
come in a variety of sizes and shapes ranging from 4 mm to
16 mm in 2-mm increments. There are four categories of
shapes tailored to a variety of embolization parameters (i.e.,
low profile, short landing zone, variable landing zone, and
high flow); a low-profile subtype was used in our patient. The
Amplatzer plug has historically only been used for arterial
and venous embolization procedures, and to our knowledge
this is the first reported use in the treatment of a nephroen￾teric fistula.
