ABSTRACT
We report preliminary observations on the efficacy of bortezomib in 20 patients with AL amyloidosis whose clonal disease was active
despite treatment with a median of 3 lines of prior chemotherapy, including a thalidomide combination in all cases. Patients received
a median of 3 (range 1-6) cycles of bortezomib and 9 (45%) patients received concurrent dexamethasone. Three (15%) patients
achieved complete hematologic responses, and a further 13 (65%) achieved partial responses. Fifteen (75%) patients experienced
some degree of toxicity, which in 8 (40%) cases resulted in discontinuation of bortezomib. Bortezomib shows promise in the treatment
of systemic AL amyloidosis.

Introduction
AL amyloidosis is characterized by misfolding of structurally
unstable light chains. The objective of treatment in systemic
AL amyloidosis is suppression of monoclonal amyloidogenic
light chain production. The prognosis is poor for patients
whose underlying plasma cell dyscrasia cannot be suppressed
or when it relapses after such treatment. 
Bortezomib is a small boronic acid derivative that inhibits the
26S proteosome1 which can produce clinically useful remis￾sions in patients with relapsed myeloma.2, 3 Bortezomib has
efficacy in myeloma refractory to thalidomide4 but has sub￾stantial, although often manageable, toxicity.5 Encouraging
data from myeloma suggested that it might also be a useful
agent in AL amyloidosis. We report preliminary clinical obser￾vations on the efficacy of bortezomib in a cohort of patients
with systemic AL amyloidosis and relapsed or refractory clon￾al disease.
Design and Methods
We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients with AL
amyloidosis who were followed up at the UK NAC between
April 2004 and November 2006, and who had received off￾label treatment with bortezomib. Bortezomib treatment was
offered only to patients who: had received at least 1 line of
prior treatment (including in every case a thalidomide based
combination regimen); had evidence of active clonal disease
and progressive amyloidosis; were considered ineligible for
stem cell transplantation;6 and did not have clinically signifi￾cant neuropathy. Patients were informed that bortezomib had
been demonstrated to have activity and was licensed in myelo￾ma, but that it had not been studied in AL amyloidosis and did
not have marketing authorization for this particular indication.
All patients gave written informed consent to treatment.
Approval for retrospective analysis and publication was
obtained from the institutional review board, and written con￾sent for publication of anonymous material was obtained from
all patients. Diagnosis of AL amyloidosis was made immuno￾histochemically supported by genetic testing as previously
described .7 All patients were evaluated before receiving borte￾zomib and 6 monthly thereafter for assessment of involvement
and change in amyloidotic organ function and whole body
amyloid load by SAP scintigraphy.8, 9 Blood samples were
obtained at monthly intervals during and immediately after
bortezomib treatment for measurement of serum free light
chain (FLC) concentration (Freelite™, The Binding Site,

Birmingham, UK) and two monthly for monoclonal
immunoglobulin measurements. Bortezomib was
administered as a bolus intravenous injection twice
weekly for 2 weeks (days 1, 4, 8, and 11) followed by a
10-day rest period (days 12-21). Since this was not a
prospective trial, doses were adapted from standard
myeloma treatment at the discretion of individual hema￾tologists. All patients received standard antifungal, anti￾viral, co-trimoxazole and proton pump inhibitor prophy￾laxis according to local protocol. Hematologic response,
toxicity, overall survival (OS), time to clonal disease
relapse, amyloidotic organ response and change in amy￾loid load by serial SAP scintigraphy were evaluated.
Hematologic response to bortezomib was systematically
determined by conventional serum and urine elec￾trophoresis and immunofixation as well as by FLC assay,
and was conservatively classified as the worst of either
the FLC response or conventional serum or urine mono￾clonal protein response. Conventional response and
relapse was defined according to the Bladè criteria.10 FLC
response and relapse were as previously defined.11
Although FLC concentration was measured after each
cycle of bortezomib, the final classification of response
was determined ≥3 months after completion/discontinu￾ation of bortezomib therapy or before the next line of
treatment began. All monoclonal protein studies and FLC
measurements were undertaken centrally at the NAC
and were reported by a senior scientist according to stan￾dard NAC practice. Progression free survival was defined
as the time to clonal relapse or death due to progressive
amyloidosis. Toxicity was graded according to the
National Cancer Institute Cancer Therapy Evaluation
Program, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events (Version 3.0). Amyloidotic organ involvement and
responses were defined according to the international
consensus criteria12 and performance status was assessed
according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) criteria.13 Statistical analysis was undertaken
using the SPSS 14 software package (SPSS, Chicago,
USA). Survival was assessed by the Kaplan-Meier
method. Categorical variables were compared with χ2 or
Fishers tests as appropriate. 
Results and Discussion
Twenty patients who were treated with bortezomib
(alone or with additional dexamethasone) were identi￾fied from the NAC database. They had received a medi￾an of 3 (range 1-6) lines of previous chemotherapy,
including an autologous stem cell transplant in 5 (25%)
cases, and were refractory to the last line of treatment.
Median age was 59 years (range 42-73), median ECOG
performance status was 2, and median number of organs
involved by amyloid was 2 (range 1-4). Twelve patients
had cardiac amyloidosis and 4 were dialysis dependent.
Patients received a median of 3 (1-6) cycles of borte￾zomib, at a median dose of 1.3 mg/m2
/dose (range 1-1.3).
One mg/m2
/dose was administered to patients receiving
renal replacement therapy. Nine (45%) patients received
concurrent dexamethasone, 6 the days of bortezomib
infusions (i.e. days 1, 4, 8, 11) and 3 others on days 1-4 of
each cycle. The median daily dexamethasone dose was
20mg (10-40mg). 
Median follow-up from end of treatment was 11 (3-30)
months, and from diagnosis of amyloidosis 33 (range 6-
92) months. A complete hematologic response (CR)
occurred in 3 (15%) patients, and a partial response (PR)
in 13 (65%) further cases. A median of 3 (range 1-6)
cycles of bortezomib was administered before a free light
chain response was recorded. Seven out of 9 (77%)
patients who were given bortezomib with dexametha￾sone responded compared to 9 out of 11 (81%) patients
given bortezomib alone. Four responders subsequently
relapsed, after a median remission of 9 (range 4-22)
months. 
Amyloidotic organ function improved in 6 out of 16
(38%) responders and remained stable in the remaining
10. Three showed improvement in renal function with a
decrease in 24 hour proteinuria of 55%, 60% and 80%
respectively, in the presence of stable or improving renal
excretory function. Two patients had hepatic improve￾ment but no patient had cardiac improvement. Serial SAP
scintigraphy revealed amyloid regression in 2 out of the
16 (13%) (Figure 1) responders and stable deposits in the
remainder. The median survival was not reached by
Kaplan-Meier estimation at 24 months from the end of
treatment. Four patients died during the follow-up peri￾od, 3 from progressive cardiac amyloidosis (at 4, 5 and 23
months from completion of bortezomib) and 1, who had
received dexamethasone, from gastrointestinal blood
loss after development of renal failure (at 1 month).
Toxicity is detailed in Table 1. Fifteen (75%) patients
reported toxicity and 8 (40%) had toxicity which
required interruption of therapy, including 5 (25%) after
just one cycle. Three cases had a dose reduction after the
first cycle due to adverse effects. The reasons for discon￾tinuation due to toxicity included in 1 case each: fatigue,
hypotension and diarrhoea, dizziness and postural
hypotension, renal impairment, disseminated zoster,
fluid overload (two cases) and hemiballism. Peripheral
neuropathy was uniquely sensory and recovered com￾pletely after interruption of bortezomib treatment in 3
out of 4 patients.
There is an urgent need to identify new treatments for
patients with AL amyloidosis who do not respond ade￾quately to currently used chemotherapy regimens or
stem cell transplantation. Thalidomide is poorly tolerat￾ed as a single agent at therapeutic doses in AL amyloido￾sis,14 although lower doses in combination regimens
show promise.11, 15 Early data suggest some efficacy of
lenalidomide in AL amyloidosis, mainly in association
with dexamethasone.16 A commercially sponsored study
of bortezomib in AL is in progress and the results are

eagerly awaited. 
The preliminary observations we report in the present
small cohort suggest that bortezomib can have efficacy
in patients with AL amyloidosis whose clonal disease has
relapsed. A hematologic response rate of 80% observed
among these 20 patients with relapsed AL amyloidosis
was encouraging and appears to be superior to that
reported in patients with relapsed myeloma,2 probably in
keeping with the frequently low grade nature of the
clone in AL amyloidosis. Suppression of monoclonal
light chains was remarkably rapid in some patients, as
demonstrated in Figure 2. Improvement in amyloidotic
organ function became evident in over one quarter of the
patients, all of whom had progressive amyloid disease
before bortezomib had been administered. These
encouraging preliminary findings were countered by tox￾icity leading to discontinuation of treatment in 40% of
cases, and by relapse of the clonal plasma cell disease in
one quarter of hematologic responders after a median

post-treatment scans - left and right panels respectively) showing
amyloid regression from the liver six months post-bortezomib
treatment. The pre-treatment scan (left) shows markedly greater
tracer uptake in the liver compared to the spleen while the post
treatment scan (right) shows a much reduced liver uptake (which
is now similar in intensity to the splenic uptake) compared to the
earlier scan. Both scans show bony uptake, which appears
unchanged.

and autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) and by high dose dexamethasone (HDD), but the response to subsequent therapies
including thalidomide (with and without dexamethasone) and intermediate dose intravenous melphalan (IDM) was poor. A rapid and
complete serum free light chain response was observed after a single cycle of bortezomib.

remission of 9 months. Consistent with experience in AL
amyloidosis generally, a substantially higher proportion
of patients in this series discontinued bortezomib due to
toxicity than has been reported in myeloma.2 Particular
limitations inherent in this retrospective study included
lack of prospective collection of details on toxicity (the
reasons for interruption of therapy were, however, avail￾able for each patient) and limited follow-up.
Therapy with bortezomib is feasible and shows prom￾ise in the treatment of relapsed AL amyloidosis and, used
alone or in combination with dexamethasone, merits fur￾ther prospective study.
