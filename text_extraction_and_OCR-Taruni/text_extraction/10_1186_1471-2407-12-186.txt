Abstract
Background: The use of imatinib mesylate is associated with a progression free survival of 41 months in first line
treatment of metastatic or locally advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) and other studies approved that
adjuvant imatinib treatment improves the recurrence-free survival in patients with GIST. Current recommendations
include 1 year adjuvant treatment in GIST patients at risk but active studies explore different durations of treatment
with an interval of up to 5 years. While the most frequent adverse events (AEs) are blood count alterations,
abdominal discomfort and edema, the occurrence of grade 3 or 4 increase of AST or ALT is specified with 2.1% and
2.7% respectively.
Case presentation: We report a 49-year old male with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) of the small bowel
who developed liver cirrhosis under adjuvant imatinib treatment.
Conclusions: Our report supports the notion that imatinib-induced hepatotoxicity may lead to acute liver damage
with subsequent cirrhotic remodelling. Patients developing grade 3 or 4 hepatotoxicity during imatinib treatment
should therefore be carefully evaluated for chronic liver disease.

Background
The selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate
has dramatically influenced the treatment of chronic
myeloid leukemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal
tumors (GIST). First line treatment of metastatic or lo￾cally advanced GIST with imatinib is currently asso￾ciated with a PFS of 41 months [1]. The basis for
imatinib in the treatment of GIST has been further broa￾dened by other studies, which showed that adjuvant
treatment with imatinib improves the recurrence-free
survival in patients with GIST [2,3]. As imatinib treat￾ment is commonly well tolerated, the most frequent ad￾verse events (AEs) are blood count alterations,
abdominal discomfort and edema. The adjuvant Z9100
GIST trial reported on grade 3 or 4 increase of AST or
ALT in 2.1% and 2.7% respectively, indicating the rather
rare occurrence of hepatotoxicity [3]. With the imple￾mentation of imatinib for adjuvant treatment in GIST
more patients are exposed to imatinib, which may also
increase the occurrence of imatinib-induced liver dam￾age. Current recommendations include 1 year adjuvant
treatment in GIST patients at risk, but active studies
explore different durations of treatment with an interval
of up to 5 years duration. We report on a case with
liver cirrhosis in a patient with advanced GIST and
high-risk of recurrence during adjuvant treatment with
imatinib.
Case presentation
A 49-year old male patient presented with flank pain
and hematuria. The CT scan showed a large pelvic
tumor 18 cm in diameter (Figure 1). A biopsy was per￾formed and the pathologic examination revealed a spin￾dle cell tumor with co-expression of CD117 and S100
protein, as well as a point mutation in c-kit exon 11,
consistent with the diagnosis GIST. Due to the large
tumor size, neoadjuvant therapy with imatinib 400 mg
daily was initiated. After 6 months of treatment, the pa￾tient developed grade 3 hepatotoxicity with ALT and
AST elevations from normal values to 882 U/l and 383
U/l, and an elevated bilirubin of 25 umol/l. Imatinib was

paused for two weeks and parameters rapidly declined to
normal limits. Treatment was then continued at 400 mg
OD and sustained tumor shrinkage was seen in subse￾quent CT scans. After 16 months of neoadjuvant therapy
tumor shrinkage ceased and tumor size was reduced
from 18 cm to 14 cm (22% reduction). A complete tumor
resection was performed at that time. Consistent with
the clinical response, the pathological examination
revealed a tumor regression of 20% (Figure 2) with low
expression of proliferation markers (MIB <1%). Due to
the high risk of recurrence, adjuvant therapy with imati￾nib 400 mg OD was initiated. After 7 months of adjuvant
treatment, grade 4 hepatotoxicity developed with an ALT
1837 U/l and AST 1022 U/l (Figure 3) and an elevated
bilirubin of 90 umol/l. Imatinib was paused for a total
duration of 8 weeks, and subsequently the elevated trans￾aminases declined to values within normal limits. Subse￾quent re-challenge of imatinib was associated with
another episode of hepatotoxicity after 14 days of re-ex￾posure. A corresponding MRI showed the development
of cirrhotic changes of the liver (Figure 4), which had
been absent at the previous MRI 3 months before.
Other possible causes of liver damage, including metas￾tasis, alcoholic liver disease, hepatitis A, B, C, and E,
autoimmune hepatitis and metabolic disorders were
excluded. Imatinib was discontinued permanently and
the transaminases returned to normal values within
6 months. Fifteen months after discontinuation of ima￾tinib the patient is still without relapse, but cirrhotic
changes of the liver remained sustained on MRI.

Discussion
To our knowledge this is the first case, which reports on
the development of liver cirrhosis during adjuvant imati￾nib treatment in a patient with GIST. Hepatotoxicity has
been observed in about 2–5% of patients receiving imati￾nib [4-6]. Most of them present with mild temporary
liver enzyme elevations, which resolve after dose reduc￾tions or discontinuation of imatinib treatment [7,8].
However, acute liver failure has also been reported spor￾adically during imatinib treatment [9-11]. Histologic
changes have been described in some of these cases and
consist of inflammation, fatty degeneration, or necrosis
of the liver [10,12,13]. Due to the transient nature of
toxicity, re-exposure to imatinib is warranted in most
cases [14]. Prospective studies in patients with pre-existing
liver disease showed that imatinib can be administered
safely in these patients, indicating a different mechanism
for hepatic toxicity [15,16]. However, late changes have
been recognized in a patient with CML who was diag￾nosed with liver cirrhosis one year after cessation of
treatment due to imatinib-induced acute liver failure
[14]. Therefore a close follow up should be mandatory.
In asymptomatic patients constant liver enzyme mea￾surements should be adequate. If cirrhotic changes
already occurred, liver enzyme quantifications every
3 months with ultrasound of the abdomen and Alpha￾Fatal Protein measurements twice a year are performed
at our institution. If signs of consecutive liver damage
without evident morphological changes of the paren￾chyma occur, transient elastography could represent an
elegant screening method [17].
As we move forward to adjuvant therapy in GIST, a
much larger proportion of patients will receive drug ex￾posure and currently the ideal duration of adjuvant ima￾tinib treatment in high risk GIST remains undefined.
The work of Dematteo et al. indicates that the recur￾rence free survival seems to adapt after a treatment free
interval of 18 months. To determine the ideal period of
adjuvant imatinib treatment prospectively, clinical trials
are conducted to test the efficacy of a prolonged expos￾ure to adjuvant imatinib treatment in GIST for 5 years
(NCT00867113) or to evaluate the effects of 12 months
versus 36 months (NCT00116935).
Conclusion
Our report supports the notion that chronic liver disease
can be a consequence of imatinib-induced hepatotox￾icity. In consequence a careful follow-up strategy should
be implemented for patients with grade 3 or 4 hepatic
toxicity.
