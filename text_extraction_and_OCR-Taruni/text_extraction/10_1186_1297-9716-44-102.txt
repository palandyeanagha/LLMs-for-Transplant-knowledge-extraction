Abstract
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) can cause enterically-transmitted hepatitis in humans. The zoonotic nature of Hepatitis E
infections has been established in industrialized areas and domestic pigs are considered as the main reservoir. The
dynamics of transmission in pig herds therefore needs to be understood to reduce the prevalence of viremic pigs
at slaughter and prevent contaminated pig products from entering the food chain. An experimental trial was
carried out to study the main characteristics of HEV transmission between orally inoculated pigs and naïve animals.
A mathematical model was used to investigate three transmission routes, namely direct contact between pigs and two
environmental components to represent within-and between-group oro-fecal transmission. A large inter-individual
variability was observed in response to infection with an average latent period lasting 6.9 days (5.8; 7.9) in inoculated
animals and an average infectious period of 9.7 days (8.2; 11.2). Our results show that direct transmission alone, with a
partial reproduction number of 1.41 (0.21; 3.02), can be considered as a factor of persistence of infection within a
population. However, the quantity of virus present in the environment was found to play an essential role in the
transmission process strongly influencing the probability of infection with a within pen transmission rate estimated
to 2 ⋅ 10− 6
g ge− 1
d− 1
(1 ⋅ 10− 7
; 7 ⋅ 10− 6
). Between-pen environmental transmission occurred to a lesser extent
(transmission rate: 7 ⋅ 10− 8
g ge− 1
d− 1
(5 ⋅ 10− 9
; 3 ⋅ 10− 7
) but could further generate a within-group process. The
combination of these transmission routes could explain the persistence and high prevalence of HEV in pig populations.
Introduction
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a small non-enveloped single￾stranded virus, sole representative of the Hepeviridae family
[1-3]. It is the causative agent of hepatitis E in humans and
transmitted by the oro-fecal route. In most cases, the
disease is self-limiting with clinical features similar to
hepatitis A and generally does not progress to chronicity,
except in immunocompromised humans [4,5]. However, 1
to 2% of cases can experience more severe forms of the
disease leading to hepatic failures [6]. Four HEV genotypes
have been described to date and circulate in different
geographic areas. Genotypes 1 and 2 are exclusively human
viruses mainly prevalent in developing countries in Asia,
Africa and Central-America [7-9]. In these areas, hepatitis
E occurs both sporadically and in epidemic waves, due to
poor sanitation and drinking-water contamination. A
different situation is observed in industrialized countries
where sporadic HEV cases are reported. Although some of
these cases can be linked with travel history in developing
areas, the number of diagnosed autochthonous cases has
increased dramatically in the last decade [10]. These locally
acquired infections are commonly associated with
genotypes 3 and 4 [9] which are shared between humans
and animals, and are especially prevalent in domestic and
wild pigs. Although the origin of most autochthonous
HEV cases remains undetermined, some cases have been
related to the consumption of uncooked meat, liver or
offal from domestic pigs or wild animals (e.g. wild boars
or deer) [11-13]. Moreover, some studies reported se￾quence identities close to 100% between human and local
swine HEV strains and effective cross-species trans￾mission was experimentally shown for genotypes 3 and 4
[14,15]. Hepatitis E is thus recognized as an emerging
zoonosis for which domestic pigs are considered as
the main reservoir [3,10,16].

Hepatitis E virus is widespread in domestic pig popula￾tions and several studies have shown high prevalence at
the herd level with large variations at the individual pig
level [17-20]. A recent epidemiological study carried out
in France revealed seroprevalences of 65% and 31% at
farm- (n = 186) and individual-levels (n = 6565 blood
samples), respectively [19]. The broad distribution of
within-herd seroprevalences observed in this study sug￾gests that the spread of infection within the pig population
was influenced by farm-dependent characteristics. As in
humans, transmission of hepatitis E virus between pigs is
assumed to occur mainly by the oro-fecal route [21].
Although pigs of all ages have been found to shed virus in
their feces, peak prevalence is generally observed in three
to four month-old pigs and in only a small proportion of
six month-old animals [18,22,23]. Thus HEV infections
occur in young animals (3 months old on average) with
further propagation within and between pig groups. In
mathematical models, the transmission intensity is governed
by the transmission rate, denoted β and defined as the
average number of new infections produced by one
typical infected pig per time unit. This parameter is a
key component of epidemiological models, along with
the mean duration of the infectious period. These parame￾ters are required to define the basic reproduction number
(R0), which is defined as the average number of new infec￾tions produced by one infectious individual during its entire
infectious period in a fully susceptible population. Satou
and Nishiura [24] developed a model that accounted for
the distribution of time between infection and seroconver￾sion to determine the age at infection, and estimated the
basic reproduction ratio (R0 = 4.02 – 5.17) from serological
data in pig-farms in Japan. Recently, Backer et al. [25]
obtained similar R0 values when they used a Bayesian
framework to analyze the prevalence of HEV shedding
according to age group, in pig farms in the UK. In contrast,
Bouwknegt et al. [26], using data from experimental trans￾mission trials, obtained higher R0 values. This experiment
was based on serial 1 to 1 transmission experiments and
intravenous inoculation of the initial seeder pig. Further￾more, Bouwknegt et al. [27] developed a dose–response
model to study the contribution of feces as a source
for HEV transmission among pigs. However, the
dose–response relationship was obtained after intraven￾ous inoculation with subsequent extrapolation to oro-fecal
infection, assuming that oro-fecal contamination was 104
times less effective [28]. The authors showed that the oro￾fecal route of infection was likely, but not sufficient to ex￾plain the observed transmission, and concluded that other
transmission routes needed to be considered to explain
the dynamics of infection. Although these previous results
provide new insights regarding HEV transmission patterns
they are difficult to extend to a real pig farm population
that consists of small groups of animals with an extremely
heterogeneous contact structure. Moreover, the persistence
and accumulation of Hepatitis E viruses in the envir￾onment due to fecal shedding could be an important
factor for viral transmission among pigs and has not
been investigated to date.
Considering the high prevalence of HEV in pig herds
and the zoonotic nature of the infection, an in-depth
understanding of within-herd HEV dynamics should
facilitate the identification of suitable measures to decrease
HEV transmission between animals. The aim of the present
study was therefore to analyze the main characteristics of
HEV infection dynamics in pig populations, based on an
experimental transmission trial involving orally inoculated
pigs and specific-pathogen-free contact pigs. First, the
distributions of the durations of latency and infectious
periods were determined. Although infection from a
contaminated environment is considered as the primary
route of infection, close contact due to coprophagous be￾havior in pigs might be considered as a non-negligible
source of transmission via direct contact between pen￾mates. Thus, transmission parameters were estimated con￾sidering (i) direct transmission between pen-mates, (ii)
within-pen environmental transmission, and (iii) between￾pen environmental transmission representing the transfer
of fecal material from pen to pen.
Material and methods
Data
Inoculum
Viral suspensions were prepared from the liver of a pig
experimentally infected with hepatitis E virus (genotype 3,
Genebank accession number JQ953665), homogenized in
PBS (pH 7.2) and centrifuged at 1000 g at 4 °C for 20 min.
The resulting clear supernatant was purified by passage
through microfilters with a pore size of 0.45 μm (Millex-GV;
Millipore SAS, Molsheim, France). The amount of HEV was
determined by real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) as
described below.
Animals, housing conditions and preliminary study of HEV
infectivity per os
All experiments were conducted in our air-filtered level
3 biosecurity-facilities. Piglets were obtained from the
Anses SPF (specific pathogen free) pig herd and were 6
weeks old at the beginning of the experiments. This herd is
HEV-free and the piglets do not have any maternal anti￾bodies. The piglets were housed in metallic flat decks with a
punched floor for feces and urine evacuation. As in the field
situation, fecal material could accumulate in the corners,
and was not removed during the trial.
A preliminary study was conducted to determine the
infectious dose resulting in successful pig infection after
oral inoculation as well as the potential transmission of
HEV from inoculated to naive animals. Twenty-four

piglets were assigned to five groups: one control group
(four pigs) and four other groups of five animals. Three pigs
in each of these four groups were orally inoculated with
10 mL of a viral suspension titrating 104
, 105
, 106 or 108
genome equivalents per mL, respectively. The suspension
was administered using a soft sterile catheter that was gen￾tly but deeply introduced into the oesophagus to prevent
the inoculum from flowing back and further contaminating
the environment. All pigs were monitored for 26 days to
detect the success rate of the inoculations as well as poten￾tial transmission of the virus to susceptible animals.
Transmission experiment design
Sixty-eight piglets were used for the transmission experi￾ment. Eight pigs were kept as negative controls (room 0)
and the others were allotted to six rooms containing two
pens per room (Figure 1). Rooms 1 to 3 were used to
evaluate direct and environmental transmission. The pens
in these rooms were separated by solid partitions and
housed six randomly selected pigs, three of which were
orally inoculated at day 0 (D0). Rooms 4 to 6 were used to
examine between-pen transmission. Two adjacent pens,
10 cm apart, housed four inoculated and four SPF contact
pigs respectively (Figure 1). A viral suspension titrating
108 ge/mL was selected for the inoculations, based on the
results of the pre-infectivity study. Pigs received 10 mL of
this viral suspension by oral route. The experiment was
performed in accordance with EU and French regulations
on animal welfare in experimentation. The protocol was
approved (opinion 14/06/2011-3) by the Anses/ENVA/
UPEC ethical committee (agreement #16 with the National
committee for Ethics in animal experimentation).
Sample collection
Individual fecal samples were collected four days before in￾oculation and three times per week from 0 to 39 days post￾infection (dpi) when the pigs were killed for necropsy. Blood
samples were collected twice a week during the same period,
and clinical signs and rectal temperatures were monitored
on a daily basis. Euthanasia was carried out by anaesthesia by
intravenous injection of 1 g/50 kg liveweight of Nesdonal®
(Merial, Lyon, France) followed by exsanguination.
Since the hepatitis E virus presents zoonotic risks, strict
biosecurity measures were implemented to prevent pos￾sible transmission from the pigs to the animal technicians.
Gloves and facial masks were used systematically. Specific
equipment was used for each experimental room. In each
pen, samples were taken first from SPF contact pigs and
then from inoculated animals. In addition, waders and
boots were thoroughly cleaned and disinfected between
each pen to prevent transfer of fecal material from one
pen to another.
Analyses
HEV RNA quantification was adapted from the method
described by Johtikumar et al. [29] and performed as
Figure 1 Experimental design of the transmission experiment. Inoculated and susceptible animals are represented by red circles and green
triangles, respectively. Rooms 1 to 3 contained two pens housing 3 inoculated (red circles) and three susceptible contact pigs (green triangles) and
were used to assess transmission by direct contact between animals as well as transmission via the environment. Rooms 4 to 6 were dedicated to the
study of the transmission between animals in two adjacent pens separated by 10 cm. One negative control group was housed in room 0.

described in Barnaud et al. [30]. Briefly, TaqMan
RT-PCR was performed using the QuantiTec Probe
RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions with 2 μL of RNA
(template). Reverse primer (5′-AGGGGTTGGTTGGAT￾GAA-3′) was used at a final concentration of 0.25 μM,
forward primer (5′-GGTGGTTTCTGGGGTGAC-3′) at
0.1 μM and probe (FAM-TGATTCTCAGCCCTTCGC￾MGB) at a final concentration of 5 μM. A Light Cycler
apparatus (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Meylan, France)
was used for sample analysis. Reverse transcription was
carried out at 50 °C for 20 min, followed by denaturation
at 95 °C for 15 min. DNA was amplified immediately with
45 cycles at 95 °C for 10 s and 58 °C for 45 s. The final
extension was followed by cooling at 40 °C for 30 s.
Real-time RT-PCR data were collected after the reaction
and the crossing points (CP) were calculated. Standard
quantification curves were produced by plotting the CP
values against the logarithm of the input copy numbers of
standard RNA. Standard RNA was obtained after in vitro
transcription of a plasmid pCDNA 3.1 ORF2-3 HEV, as
described in Barnaud et al. [30,31].
Models
Latency and infectious periods
The distributions of the durations of the latent and infec￾tious periods for HEV infection in pigs were examined. For
each animal, the first positive fecal sample for HEV RNA
was considered as the beginning of the infectious period
and corresponded to the latency duration in inoculated
animals. Thus, data from inoculated animals was used to
determine the distribution of the latent period. The pigs
were then considered infectious until the last positive fecal
sample. Gamma-distributions were assumed for both
durations, from which the shape and rate parameters
were estimated by maximum log-likelihood method.
A nonparametric bootstrap procedure was used to determine
the 95% confidence intervals of the parameter estimates.
One thousand datasets were generated by resampling the
original dataset. For each bootstrap replicate, the model was
refitted to get the parameter estimates. The 95% confidence
interval was constructed from the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles
for each parameter [32,33].
Environmental viral load
The environmental viral load corresponds to the accu￾mulation of viral particles in the environment through
fecal shedding by infected animals, which is partially
compensated by a clearance rate, hereafter denoted δ.
For each pen (k) and every sampling time (ti), the average
quantity of genome equivalent shed in the environment
per gram of feces was calculated by Vk ð Þ¼ ti Σj Vj
k ð Þ ti =
Nk , where Vj
k ð Þ ti represents the quantity of virus shed per
gram of feces in pen κ by pig j at time ti Vj
k ð Þ¼ ti 0

for a
non shedding animal j at time ti

, and Nk the total num￾ber of animals in pen. Thus the cumulated viral load in
the environment of pen k between two sampling times ti
and ti+1 is governed by the equation:
Eki ¼ Ek ð Þ¼ tiþ1 Ek ð Þþ ti ∫
Δt
0 Vk ð Þ ti þ u eδudu  e
−δΔt
;
with Δt=ti+1 - ti. In this relation, the time points before
the first positive sample were neglected because they
would have induced an unknown but similar dilution fac￾tor in each pen for the first positive environmental load,
without any dramatic impact on the global evolution of
the viral loads in the environment. The quantity of virus
shed in the environment by fecal route between two
sampling times was approximated by linear interpolation.
Quantification of transmission
Three transmission routes were investigated in this
study: (i) transmission due to direct contact between in￾fected and naïve pigs; (ii) oro-fecal transmission via an
environmental reservoir of virus as described in the pre￾vious section; (iii) environmental transmission to pigs
housed in adjacent pens. A Bayesian framework was
used to estimate the transmission parameters [34,35],
considering the latency period and the viral clearance in
the environment as random variables. Hence, the shape
and rate parameters of the Gamma distribution repre￾senting the duration of latency period in naturally in￾fected animals were also estimated, the probability
density function being further denoted fLat(t, A, B). On
each sampling interval Di = [ti, ti + 1] of duration di, the
probability for a susceptible pig j housed in pen k to escape
infection is given by [36,37]:

the previous section, Eð Þ w

(within pen) and in the adjacent pen (between pen),
respectively. βw is the within-pen transmission rate by

Transmission parameters, parameters governing the
distribution of the latency period in naturally infected
pigs and the clearance rate of virus in the environment
(δ) were estimated by Bayesian inference using Monte
Carlo Markov Chain. Vague uninformative uniform prior
distributions were used for the three transmission
parameters, whereas informative gamma priors based
on the estimated parameters of the latency distribution in
inoculated animals were used for A and B (Γ(13.48,0.41)
and Γ(15.55,0.05), respectively). A mildly informative prior
distribution, based on expert opinion, was used for the
environmental clearance rate, which was assumed to be
normally distributed with mean 0.3 and standard deviation
0.075 (95% CI: 0.15; 0.45). Although the decay rate for HEV
is relatively low, the range of clearance rate parameter,
between 0.15 and 0.45 per day, permits to account for
variability in persistence of the virus in the environment
due to the loss of fecal material through flat decks.
Parameter updating was performed sequentially by
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with gamma proposal
distributions for all parameters. Three chains were
run with random initial conditions, 10000 steps per
chain, a burnin of 1000 steps and thinning parameter
of 10. Convergence was assessed by visual inspection
and diagnostic tests (autocorrelation, Heidelberger,
Gelman-Rubin diagnostics). Two nested model structures
were tested to analyze whether the direct contact transmis￾sion plays a role in transmission. The first model consid￾ered environmental transmission alone by forcing βw to 0
and estimating the four remaining parameters; the second
model being the full model in a 5-parameter space. Model
selection was based on Deviance Information Criterion.
Results
Preliminary study of HEV infectivity per os
All pigs inoculated with viral suspensions titrating 104
and 105 ge/mL remained negative for HEV RNA in feces
(Table 1). All but one inoculated animals were success￾fully infected with the inoculum titrating 106 ge/mL.
Moreover, one contact pig in this group shed the virus
in its feces. Finally, with inoculum titrating 108 ge/mL,
all inoculated and contact animals were found, at least
once, to be positive for HEV RNA in fecal samples
between 9 and 19 days post inoculation, indicating a
high success rate for the inoculations and effective trans￾mission to naïve piglets. In view of these preliminary
results, an inoculum titrating 108 ge/mL was used in the
transmission experiment. The inoculated and contact
pigs in the different groups did not exhibit any clinical
signs and rectal temperatures remained normal until the
end of the experiment. No macroscopic lesion could be
observed at necropsy except an enlargement of the
hepatic lymph nodes in several piglets.
Infection data and estimation of durations of latency and
infectiousness
Inoculations were administered orally so as to be as
close as possible to infections in field conditions. Infection
was successful in all but two inoculated animals for which
all fecal samples were negative for HEV RNA (Figure 2
and Figure 3). Moreover, these two pigs were seronegative
at the end of the trial (data not shown), showing that they
were not infected by contact with infectious animals
and/or material during the entire experimental period.
These two animals were considered as susceptible in
the estimation process. Inoculated pigs exhibited latent
periods ranging from 2 to 11.5 days. The durations of the
latent period after inoculation were fitted to a gamma
distribution with shape parameter aL = 5.2 (3.5; 10.0) and
rate parameter γL = 0.75 (0.52; 1.39) (Figure 4, left panel),
leading to an estimated mean duration of the latent period
of 6.9 days (5.8; 7.9). Using the same methodology and
based on data from inoculated and contact animals, the
estimated mean duration of the infectious period was 9.7
days (8.2; 11.3) (Figure 4, right panel). All successfully
inoculated pigs were found to shed viral RNA in their
feces according to a unimodal curve but with large inter￾individual variability. Viral shedding peaks occurred
between 8 and 17 days post-inoculation. Although
most animals shed less than 5⋅105 ge/g of feces during the
entire experiment, two of them in groups 3 and 5 shed

more than 106 ge/g and thus contributed to a rapid increase
of the viral load present in the environment (Figure 5).
Fourteen of the eighteen naïve pigs in direct contact
with inoculated animals (groups 1–6), were infected
during the experiment (Figure 2). The first positive fecal
sample in contact pigs was observed at 15 dpi in group
3 in which the inoculated animals were infectious soon
after inoculation (2 – 5 dpi) and had the highest amount
of viral RNA in their feces. In the other groups, fecal
samples from contact pigs were found positive for HEV
RNA between 21 and 30 dpi. In group 4, a gap of 14
days was observed between the last positive fecal sample
in inoculated pigs and the first positive sample in
contact pigs. Thus, in this specific group, direct trans￾mission was unlikely therefore suggesting oro-fecal
contamination through the environmental reservoir of
the virus. Environmental transmission between adjacent
pens was effective in only one transmission experiment
(Room 4, group b, Figure 3). Moreover, positive samples
were obtained from only one pig in this group, from
31 to 36 dpi, whereas the three remaining contact
pigs were positive at 44 dpi, suggesting the occurrence of
within-group transmission after the first infection.
Environmental viral load
The quantity of virus present in the environment was
approximated in each group from the quantity of virus
shed in feces by infected animals. The profiles of envir￾onmental viral load in each group in direct contact are
shown in Figure 5 assuming a baseline clearance rate of
30% per day. Groups 2, 3 and 5 exhibited similar single￾mode profiles reflecting the high quantities of virus shed
mainly by inoculated pigs, as well as a rapid spread of
the infection among susceptible pigs. According to
individual data, the infected contact animals in groups 1
and 6 exhibited longer shedding periods leading to an
increase in the environmental load around 30 dpi. More￾over, the individual RT-PCR results for infected contact
pigs in group 6 revealed that these animals shed more
than 106 ge/g of feces, thus indicating the essential con￾tribution of these pigs to the environmental viral load.
The profile observed in group 4 was totally different
with two modes separated by a time-interval of 20 days
between each mode. In this group, a lag phase of 14 days
was observed between the last positive fecal sample from
inoculated pigs and the first positive sample from
contact animals. Although the approximated amount of
virus present in the environment was relatively low in
regard to other groups, oro-fecal transmission probably
occurred because of the permanent exposure of contact
animals to the contaminated environment.
Quantification of transmission
Two model structures were compared to test whether
direct transmission was necessary to explain data or if
environmental transmission could be enough to rep￾resent the transmission process (forcing the param￾eter βw to 0). Model selection, performed using
Deviance Information Criterion (DIC), shows that the
full model, including direct transmission, better
described the data (ΔDIC > 5; data not shown). The
results reported in Table 2 consist of the median
value and 95% credibility interval for each estimated
Figure 4 Fits of the distribution of the latent (left panel) and infectious (right panel) periods. We assumed gamma distributions for both
periods and used the maximum likelihood method to estimate the shape and scale parameters (full lines). 95% confidence bands (dashed lines)
were obtained by the bootstrapping method (see text for details).

parameter considering the best fitting model structure
(full model).
Latency duration in contact animals was found similar as
in inoculated animals, with a mean latency period of 7.1
days (95% credibility interval: 3.2; 12.3). The posterior mean
clearance rate was estimated at 0.33 per day (95% credibility
interval: (0.19; 0.46)). The Bayesian framework developed
for estimation of transmission parameters accounted for
variability caused by the latency period duration and clear￾ance rate. Our results show that, under experimental condi￾tions, one shedding pig would be able to transmit the virus
to 0.15 pig per day by direct contact (βw = 0.15 (0.03; 0.31)).
With an estimated average duration of the infectious period

for direct transmission only, was slightly greater than one

Discussion
Several studies of experimental HEV-infections by different
inoculation methods, such as intravenous (iv) or oral
inoculations, have been reported [21,26,27,38-42]. Although
oro-fecal transmission is considered the most probable
Figure 5 Estimated environment viral loads in groups 1 to 6. The average quantity of genome equivalent per gram of feces shed in the
environment was first evaluated (dots) at each sampling-time. The environmental viral load (full lines) corresponds to the accumulation of viral
particles in the environment through fecal shedding by infected animals, which is partially compensated by a clearance rate.

route of infection in field conditions, oral inoculation
was shown to be less efficient than iv inoculation
[21,40]. According to Kasorndorkbua et al. [21], oro-fecal
transmission of HEV in pigs would require repeated
exposures to high doses of virus. Transmission from
inoculated to naïve pigs was demonstrated in several
studies regardless of the inoculation route. However,
most of these studies considered contact-exposure to
intravenously inoculated pigs. Bouwknegt et al. quantified
the transmission of HEV using three successive gener￾ations of contact-exposure pigs, the first generation
being obtained by exposure of naïve pigs to animals
inoculated intravenously [26]. Considering both direct
and indirect transmissions and a constant latent period of
three days (based on observations in iv-inoculated
animals), they obtained a basic reproduction number
of 8.8, which appears rather high compared with estimates
based on field data [24,25]. More recently, Casas et al.
studied transmission from pigs orally inoculated with a
bile suspension to naïve piglets [40]. Although oral
inoculation was confirmed to be less efficient than
intravenous inoculation with 4 successful infections
among 16 inoculated pigs, the results highlighted for
the first time the effective transmission of HEV to naïve
piglets after oral inoculation. However, this study was not
designed to quantify the transmission of HEV.
In the preliminary infectivity study, oral inoculations
with viral suspension titers below 106 ge/mL were ineffi￾cient. This could explain the success rate obtained by
Casas and collaborators (25%) since the titer of the bile
suspension used for the inoculations was 2⋅105 ge/mL. In
the preliminary study, all inoculations with viral suspen￾sions titrating 108 ge/mL were successful and transmission
to naïve pigs was effective. Therefore, in the transmis￾sion experiment, 26 SPF pigs were orally inoculated
with an inoculum titrating 108 ge/mL and 24 (92%)
were successfully infected.
Exponential distributions are widely used in epidemio￾logical models to represent the durations of the different
disease stages. Thus constant transition rates are used to
model the transitions between the stages, irrespectively
of the time spent in one specific stage. Although convenient
from a mathematical point of view, this assumption is un￾realistic as regards the epidemiology of most infectious
agents [43]. Moreover, the inclusion of more realistic distri￾butions, such as gamma distributions, can dramatically
modify the behavior of a model and have consequences on
eventual control measures [44,45]. However, estimating the
distributions of latent and infectious periods is often chal￾lenging since the true course of infection is generally un￾known. This issue can be addressed by using animal
experiments since the time of infection corresponds to the
time of inoculation and the course of infection in inocu￾lated animals can subsequently be monitored. Considerable
inter-individual variability was observed in the kinetics of
infection after inoculation especially regarding the dura￾tions of the latent and infectious periods. The time lapse
between inoculation and the first positive fecal sample
ranged between 2 and 13 days and was fitted to a gamma
distribution. The estimated mean latent period in orally in￾oculated animals was 6.9 and 7.1 days in contact animals
compared to 3 days after iv inoculations [26]. The durations
remained comparable in inoculated and naturally infected
animals, supporting the hypothesis that oral inoculation is a
good model to mimic the infection route in natural condi￾tions. This clearly indicates that the inoculation route influ￾ences the within-host kinetics of infection, the latent period
being longer in orally inoculated pigs, supporting the re￾sults of Bouwknegt et al. [39] who compared the course of
infection in intravenously inoculated and contact animals.
In the context of oral inoculations, our results show that
the pigs shed virus in their feces for 9.7 days (8.2; 11.2) on
average which appears relatively short compared with pre￾vious estimates [26] (49 days (17; 141); 13 days (11; 17) in
two different blocks).
Three transmission parameters were considered in the
present study: the first one relies on transmission due to
direct contact between animals; the two others are re￾lated to an environmental component in the transmis￾sion process according to the contact structure (within￾and between-pen transmission). Indeed, in addition to
the fact that oro-fecal transmission is probably the nat￾ural route for HEV infection, the soundness of an envir￾onmental transmission representation was confirmed by
the observations derived from the experiment: contact
pigs in one group (group 4) were found to be infectious
about 14 days after the last positive fecal sample had

been obtained from inoculated pigs. It is apparent from the
mean duration of the latent period in contact animals (7.1
days (3.2; 12.3)), that these late infections were undoubtedly
caused by the ingestion of viral material present in the en￾vironment. However, including such a component required
to represent the amount of virus in the environment. We
therefore used the amounts of viral RNA shed in the feces
by each animal to approximate the cumulated viral load
present in the environment in each pen and accounting for
a clearance rate of the virus in the environment, reflecting
both the inactivation rate of the virus and the loss of fecal
material through the flat decks. The clearance rate was
included as a parameter to be estimated in the Bayesian
analysis using a mildly informative prior distribution. The
comparison of two model structures, including or not the
direct transmission between pigs, evidenced that the com￾bination of direct and environmental transmissions best fit￾ted the observed course of infection during the experiment.
By analogy to the definitions of direct transmission rates,
within-pen environmental transmission parameter, denoted
βð Þ w
E , reflects the average number of animals infected per
genome equivalent per gram of feces in the environment.
However, since this definition is highly abstract, we chose to
define the relative environmental transmission rate as the
inverse of βð Þ w
E , which would correspond to the number
of viral RNA required to infect one pig (in the absence
of direct transmission) and which, consistently with the re￾sults of the preliminary infectivity study, was estimated at
5.62 ⋅ 105 ge/g (1.45 ⋅ 105
; 9.34 ⋅ 106
). However, direct trans￾mission plays a major role in the transmission process, with
an estimated transmission rate of 0.15 (0.03; 0.31). The esti￾mated partial reproduction number, accounting solely for
direct transmission, was Rd
0 ¼ 1:41 0ð Þ :21; 3:02 . Larger R0
estimates have been previously published for HEV [24-26]
without distinct representation of direct and environmental
transmission which confirms our findings related to the
major contribution of the environment in the overall trans￾mission process. According to our results, a single infec￾tious individual generates through direct contact on average
1.41 infectious individuals during its entire infectious period
in a fully susceptible population, thus permitting persistence
of the infection within the population. At the same time the
environmental load increases as a result of fecal shedding
and leads to an increase in the force of infection
applied to susceptible individuals. Although the duration
of the infectious period was relatively short compared with
previous estimates, the accumulation and persistence of
viral particles in the environment is pivotal for the spread
of infection. In our experimental set-up, environmental
transmission between adjacent pens was found to be
a rare event. However, as shown by group b in room 4,
such transmission can occur, and further generate a
within-group transmission process.
Under the experimental conditions of this study, direct
and within-pen environmental transmissions were essential
components to explain the transmission process, whereas
environmental transmission between-pens remained a rare
event. In view of these results, strict segregating of pigs in
pens and avoidance of movement between pens, could limit
the transmission process. HEV propagation within pig pop￾ulations is therefore highly dependent on pig management
and hygiene procedures. The combination of the three
transmission processes could lead to a very diverse intensity
of virus propagation between animals, which is consistent
with the great variability in seroprevalence observed in
slaughter pigs between farms [19]. Given the importance of
the environmental reservoir in the transmission process,
the strict separation of pigs from this pool of virus should
shorten the transmission chain to a large extent. Husbandry
practices such as intense mingling at different stages, poor
hygienic conditions or floor characteristics favoring the per￾sistence of virus can lead to dramatic waterfall sequences
and may explain the high HEV prevalence observed in pig
herds in several countries [17,19,20,46].
