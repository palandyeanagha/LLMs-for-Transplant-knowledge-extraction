Abstract
Fibrosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Currently, therapeutic options for
tissue fibrosis are severely limited, and organ transplantation is the only effective treatment for
end-stage fibrotic disease. However, demand for donor organs greatly outstrips supply, and so
effective anti-fibrotic treatments are urgently required. In recent years the integrin family of cell
adhesion receptors have gained prominence as key regulators of chronic inflammation and
fibrosis. Fibrosis models in multiple organs have demonstrated that integrins have profound
effects on the fibrotic process. There is now abundant in vivo data demonstrating critical
regulatory roles for integrins expressed on different cell types during tissue fibrogenesis. In this
review we will examine the ways in which integrins regulate these processes and discuss how the
manipulation of integrins using function blocking antibodies and small molecule inhibitors may
have clinical utility in the treatment of patients with a broad range of fibrotic diseases.

Introduction
Fibrosis represents a massive health care burden worldwide. Chronic tissue injury with
fibrogenesis results in disruption of tissue architecture, organ dysfunction and eventually
organ failure. Our therapeutic repertoire for the treatment of tissue fibrosis is severely
limited and organ transplantation is currently the only effective treatment in end-stage
fibrotic disease. However, organ transplantation has several disadvantages including limited
donor organ availability, high cost, co-morbidities in potential recipients and on a global
scale, organ transplantation can only be offered to a small percentage of the patients
suffering from the complications of fibrosis. Therefore there is an urgent imperative to
develop effective anti-fibrotic therapies.

A universal feature of tissue fibrogenesis is the complex interplay between the
inflammatory, epithelial, myofibroblast and extracellular matrix components of the wound
healing response1,2,3. Furthermore, the pericellular extracellular matrix is a highly dynamic
environment known to exert profound influences on cell behaviour. Many of the key cell￾cell and cell-matrix interactions which regulate fibrosis are mediated by members of the
integrin family of cell adhesion molecules, of which there are 24 known members in humans
(noncovalent α/β heterodimers composed from 18 different α subunits and 8 β subunits).
Integrins represent a major mode of communication between the extracellular matrix,
inflammatory cells, fibroblasts and parenchymal cells and hence are intimately involved in
the processes that govern the initiation, maintenance and resolution of tissue fibrosis.
Integrins are transmembrane proteins and are major receptors for cell adhesion to
extracellular matrix proteins and cell-cell adhesion4
. These molecules can therefore mediate
the translation of spatially fixed extracellular signals into a wide variety of changes in cell
behavior including cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis4,5. In
addition to their direct effects on cellular proliferation and survival, integrins can also
potentiate signals from soluble growth and survival factors. For example, nearly all of the
pro-fibrogenic cytokine transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ1) is secreted and bound to
the extracellular matrix in a latent form, and therefore conversion to an active form is an
important step in the regulation of TGFβ1 activity. In recent years it has become clear that a
subset of the integrin family (αv integrins) play a key role in the activation of latent TGFβ1.
Specifically, the integrins αvβ3, αvβ5, αvβ6 and αvβ8 have been shown to bind the RGD
sequence in the latency associated peptide (LAP) of TGF-β1 and -β3, and have the potential
to activate latent TGF-β
6,7,8,9,10. In this review we will highlight recent data demonstrating
the profound effects of integrins in modulating the fibrotic process via activation of TGFβ,
and how pharmacologic manipulation of specific integrins may lead to the development of
new antifibrotic treatments.
Lung fibrosis
αv integrin-mediated activation of latent TGFβ
Secreted transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ1) is a major pro-fibrogenic cytokine and
a key regulator of fibrosis in multiple organs11,12,13. Therefore, the molecular pathways that
regulate TGFβ1 activity and signaling are attractive targets for novel anti-fibrotic therapies.
There are three mammalian isoforms of TGFβ, and all are synthesized as precursor proteins
that are processed by proteolytic cleavage in the endoplasmic reticulum and assembled as a
non-covalent complex of a disulfide linked homodimer of the mature cytokine (a short C￾terminal fragment) and a disulfide linked homodimer of a larger amino terminal fragment
called the latency associated peptide (LAP), forming the “small latent complex”. In this
form the associated LAP homodimer prevents the mature C-terminal fragment from binding
to its receptors and inducing TGFβ’s known effects. This “small latent complex” is further
modified in the endoplasmic reticulum by disulfide linkage to another family of gene
proteins called latent TGFβ binding proteins, which, upon secretion, are themselves
chemically cross-linked to the extracellular matrix, to store and tether TGFβ in a latent form
in the extracellular space. Much of the regulation of TGFβ biology thus occurs at the level
of extracellular activation of this stored latent complex14,15
.
Because the active form of TGFβ is non-covalently linked to the latency associated peptide
and easily dissociates upon changes in temperature or pH15
, in vitro examination of TGFβ
activation has been difficult. Therefore, the in vivo mechanisms of matrix-bound latent
TGFβ conversion into an active cytokine is a subject of intense research. Two of the three
mammalian TGFβ isoforms (TGFβ1 and 3) can be activated by members of the integrin
family that interact with a linear arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) motif present in the
latency associated peptide6,7,16. Inhibition and blockade of two of these integrins (αvβ6 and

αvβ8) phenocopies all of the developmental effects of loss of TGFβ1 and 317, suggesting
that these two integrins are required for most or all important roles of these TGFβ isoforms
during development. However, the mechanisms of TGFβ activation that contribute to tissue
pathology in adults are less well understood.
In the lung, the αvβ6 integrin is minimally expressed in alveolar epithelial cells at baseline
but is rapidly induced in this cell type following lung injury18. Evidence supporting an
important role for the αvβ6 integrin in TGFβ1 activation came from observation of the
phenotype of β6 integrin subunit knockout mice. These mice develop exaggerated
inflammatory responses in the lungs and skin, reminiscent of, but less severe than the
exaggerated inflammation seen in mice homozygous for a null mutation of TGFβ1
19
.
Furthermore, following treatment with bleomycin (a widely used inducer of pulmonary
fibrosis), β6 null mice develop exaggerated inflammation but are dramatically protected
from subsequent pulmonary fibrosis6
. β6 inhibition (both by genetic knockout and blockade
by anti-αvβ6 antibodies) was also protective in radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis20. The
αvβ6 integrin can bind directly to the LAP of TGFβ1 and TGFβ3
16 and cells expressing
αvβ6 generate TGFβ1 activity in vitro that can be completely inhibited by β6 blocking
antibodies. In addition, microarray analysis of the lungs of wild type or β6 null mice
following intratracheal instillation of bleomycin identified a large group of TGFβ-inducible
genes that were induced at substantially lower levels in β6 knockout mice21. Taken together,
these data demonstrate that αvβ6 integrin expression on lung epithelial cells is a major
regulator of TGFβ1 activation during lung fibrosis.
Activation of TGFβ1 was inhibited by blockade of actin polymerization6
 and by Rho kinase
inhibition22, suggesting a role for force generation by the actin cytoskeleton. Indeed, the
recently solved crystal structure of the small latent complex of TGFβ1 demonstrated that
mechanical force generated by integrins is a common mechanism for activating latent
TGFβ1
23. Shi and colleagues found that crystals of dimeric porcine proTGF-β1 revealed a
ring-shaped complex, a novel fold for the prodomain (LAP) of TGFβ1, and demonstrated
that the prodomain shields the growth factor from recognition by receptors and alters its
conformation. Furthermore, complex formation between αvβ6 integrin and the prodomain
of TGFβ1 was insufficient for TGFβ1 release, and force-dependent activation of TGFβ1
required unfastening of a “straitjacket” that encircles each growth factor monomer.
Myofibroblasts are a further cell type intrinsically involved in the fibrotic process, as they
are the major source of extracellular matrix proteins during organ scarring. These contractile
cells express several αv integrins and force generated by the actomyosin cytoskeleton can be
transmitted to the extracellular matrix by αv integrins. Elegant in vitro studies of
myofibroblasts have shown that these cells can utilize alternative αv integrins to activate
TGFβ1, and demonstrates that myofibroblasts can liberate and activate TGFβ1 from pre￾existing and self-generated deposits in the extracellular matrix by transmitting their high
contractile force to the large latent complex through αvβ5 integrin and as yet unidentified
β1 and 3 integrins10
.
The integrin αvβ8 is also capable of binding to and activating TGFβ1
7
. This was an
unexpected finding, as αvβ6-mediated activation was found to depend critically on
sequences within the β6 cytoplasmic domain6
, however the β8 cytoplasmic domain and the
β6 cytoplasmic domain are completely divergent. In addition, even deletion of the β8
cytoplasmic domain did not diminish αvβ8-mediated TGFβ1 activation, suggesting that
these integrins (which both bind to the same RGD sequence in the TGFβ1 and TGFβ3
latency associated peptides) might activate the TGFβ1 latent complex by differing
mechanisms. Further work demonstrated this to be the case. In contrast to αvβ6 mediated
activation of TGFβ1, which depends on direct cell-cell contact, αvβ8-mediated activation

releases active TGFβ1 into the culture medium of αvβ8 expressing cells. In addition,
whereas αvβ6-mediated activation is completely resistant to inhibition by a variety of
protease inhibitors, metalloprotease inhibitors abolish αvβ8-mediated TGFβ1 activation,
and transfection studies in cells demonstrated a role for the protease MT1-MMP (MMP14)
in this process. Therefore αvβ8 appears to activate TGFβ1 by presenting latent complexes
to cell-surface metaloproteases which degrade the latency associated peptide and release free
TGFβ1 into the extracellular milieu. An important role for αvβ8-mediated TGFβ1
activation in vivo is supported by studies of β8 knockout mice. Some of these mice die in
mid-gestation from a defect in vascular development reminiscent of that seen in some
TGFβ1 null mice24. Mice that survive to birth die soon after from brain haemorrhage that
could be explained by loss of developmental vascular effects of TGFβ1. Furthermore, many
of these mice have a cleft palate, a prominent feature in TGFβ-3 knockout mice25
.
These data strongly suggest that the αvβ8 integrin is an important regulator of TGFβ1 and
TGFβ3 activation in vivo, but does manipulation of this integrin have any modulatory effect
on the fibrotic process? Previous studies have shown that αvβ8 expression is increased in
the airway fibroblasts of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) patients and
expression correlated with the extent of airway wall fibrosis. Furthermore, αvβ8-mediated
activation of TGFβ1 by COPD fibroblasts increased pro-fibrogenic differentiation26
.
Recently studies conducted by the same group have examined the role of fibroblast αvβ8 in
murine airway fibrosis27. Kitamura et al. demonstrated that conditional deletion of lung
fibroblast αvβ8 inhibited airway fibrosis in both IL-1β and ovalbumin-induced murine
models of airway fibrosis. Furthermore, deletion of αvβ8 reduced TGFβ1 activation by
cultured mouse lung fibroblasts. Extending their studies to human lung fibroblasts, the
authors also found that IL-1β enhanced αvβ8-dependent TGFβ activation, collagen
expression and pro-inflammatory gene expression in COPD compared with normal lung
fibroblasts.
α3β1-mediated regulation of lung fibrosis
In recent years the origin of myofibroblasts in pulmonary fibrosis has been intensely studied,
with potential sources including resident fibroblasts, circulating progenitors and epithelial￾mesenchymal transition (EMT)28,29,30. Because the extracellular matrix is a key regulator of
alveolar epithelial cell responses to TGFβ1 (and this cytokine is a potent inducer of EMT in
vitro), Kim and colleagues investigated the role of the prominent epithelial integrin α3β1 (a
laminin receptor known to co-localise with E-cadherin and β-catenin at adherens
junctions31) in a mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis using mice with conditional epithelial
cell-specific deletion of α3 integrin expression32. Despite a normal response to acute
bleomycin-induced lung injury, these mice demonstrated a reduction in lung myofibroblasts
and type I collagen and did not progress to fibrosis. To investigate whether this phenotype
was secondary to a reduction in EMT, the authors examined β-catenin signalling as β￾catenin has been implicated in EMT. They found that in primary alveolar epithelial cells α3
integrin was required for β-catenin phosphorylation at tyrosine residue 654 (Y654),
formation of a pY654-β-catenin/p-SMAD2 complex, and initiation of EMT both in vitro and
in vivo during fibrosis following bleomycin-induced lung injury. Furthermore, analysis of
human lung tissue from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients demonstrated pY654-β￾catenin-pSMAD2 complexes and accumulation of pY654-β-catenin in myofibroblasts. This
suggests that alveolar epithelial integrin-dependent crosstalk between β-catenin and Smad
signaling is important during the evolution of lung fibrosis, and that EMT plays a role in the
development of lung fibrosis. However, it should also be noted that a number of recent cell
fate mapping studies in multiple organs including the lung, have shown that EMT does not
directly contribute to the pool of collagen-producing myofibroblasts during fibrogenesis in

vivo
33,34,35. The molecular mechanisms of integrin-mediated regulation of lung fibrosis are
summarized in Figure 1.
Liver fibrosis
Integrin αvβ6 mRNA expression is increased in patients with fibrotic liver disease
secondary to a variety of aetiologies (primary biliary cirrhosis, alcohol-induced, hepatitis B
and C) and expression increases with fibrosis stage in hepatitis C36. Furthermore αvβ6
expression is virtually absent in normal liver but is significantly upregulated in rodent
models of liver fibrosis36,37. Using the bile duct ligation model of acute biliary fibrosis
Wang et al.37 demonstrated that bile duct obstruction induces a marked increase in
cholangiocyte αvβ6 expression. Furthermore, biliary fibrosis is reduced by 50% in β6
integrin null mice compared to wild type controls, and administration of a blocking antibody
to αvβ6 significantly decreased acute fibrosis after bile duct ligation. A recent study has also
examined the effect of a small molecule inhibitor of αvβ6 (EMD527040) during biliary
fibrosis38. Biliary fibrosis was studied in rats after bile duct ligation and in Mdr2(abcb4)−/−
mice. Differing doses of EMD527040 were given to rats from week 2 to 6 after BDL and to
Mdr2(abcb4)−/− mice from weeks 4 to 8. EMD527040 reduced bile duct proliferation and
peribiliary collagen deposition by 40–50%, decreased pro-fibrotic gene expression and up￾regulated fibrolytic genes.
Hepatic stellate cells (Ito cells, liver specific pericytes) are the major source of extracellular
matrix proteins during hepatic fibrogenesis39,40, and therefore represent an important target
in the development of anti-fibrotic therapies for liver fibrosis. Zhou et al. examined the
possibility that stellate cell fate is influenced by the extracellular matrix through the
intermediary of αvβ3 integrin41
. αvβ3 was expressed by rat and human culture-activated
liver myofibroblasts, and blockade of this integrin inhibited stellate cell proliferation and
increased apoptosis of cultured stellate cells. A recent study using cilengitide (an antagonist
mainly selective for αvβ3 and αvβ5, with less potency towards αvβ6) demonstrated a 30%
increase in hepatic collagen in two models of liver fibrosis (bile duct ligation and
thioacetamide (TAA)-induced)42
.
Kidney fibrosis
αvβ6 integrin expression is low in the normal kidney, but marked induction of this integrin
occurs in a wide range of renal diseases associated with chronic inflammation and fibrosis.
Human biopsy samples from membranous glomerulonephritis, diabetes mellitus, IgA
nephropathy, Goodpasture’s syndrome, Alport syndrome and lupus all demonstrated
prominent αvβ6 staining in the epithelial lining of dilated and damaged tubules43. To assess
the potential regulatory role of αvβ6 in renal fibrosis, Hahm et al. investigated the effects of
function-blocking αvβ6 antibodies and genetic ablation of the β6 subunit using a mouse
model of Alport syndrome (Col4A3−/− mice). αvβ6-blocking antibody treatment attenuated
accumulation of activated fibroblasts and deposition of interstitial collagen matrix, and
similar inhibition of renal fibrosis was observed in β6-deficient Alport mice. Renal fibrosis
is also decreased in β6 null mice following unilateral ureteric obstruction44, further
demonstrating that αvβ6 plays a central regulatory role in the pathogenesis of kidney
fibrosis.
Skin fibrosis
In recent years there have been a number of studies focusing on the role of the αv integrins
in skin fibrosis and wound healing. Systemic sclerosis or scleroderma is an acquired disease
typically leading to fibrosis of the skin and internal organs3
. αvβ3 and αvβ5 expression are
upregulated on human scleroderma fibroblasts and both of these integrins are involved in
Henderson and Sheppard Page 5

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript

activation of latent TGFβ1 in primary cultures of these cells. Furthermore, treatment of
scleroderma fibroblasts with anti-αvβ3 and αvβ5 antibodies reduced type I procollagen
expression8,9,45,46,47. A role for αvβ6 in skin wound healing has also been examined. αvβ6
expression is strongly upregulated in the epidermis of human chronic wounds. Furthermore,
transgenic mice harboring the human β6 integrin gene under the control of the cytokeratin
14 promoter (to target constitutive expression of the αvβ6 integrin in epidermal basal cells)
develop spontaneous chronic skin wounds surrounded by progressive fibrosis48. In addition,
aged β6 null mice demonstrate a significant delay in wound healing when compared to age￾matched controls49
.
Skin scleroderma can be modeled in mice by repetitive subcutaneous injection of bleomycin.
To investigate the role of β1 integrin in cutaneous sclerosis Liu et al. generated mice with
fibroblast specific deletion of the β1 integrin (using mice expressing a tamoxifen-inducible
Cre recombinase driven by the mouse collagen type 1, alpha 2 promoter)50. Bleomycin
treatment induced marked cutaneous thickening and fibrosis in control mice, however
fibroblast specific deletion of β1 integrins resulted in resistance to bleomycin-induced skin
fibrosis.
Table 1 summarizes the murine fibrosis models which have demonstrated a role for integrins
in the regulation of fibrosis in vivo. Clearly these studies cannot be translated directly to
human disease, but they do offer very useful insights into the molecular mechanisms driving
fibrosis, allowing potential therapeutic targets to be identified.
Therapeutic targeting of integrins
Although TGFβ1 is a promising target for the treatment of fibrotic diseases, all of the
currently available methods for inhibiting TGFβ target all three mammalian isoforms. TGFβ
inhibitors therefore have the potential for important unintended side effects. One concern
relates to the potential for carcinogenesis as TGFβ1 has an anti-proliferative effect on most
epithelial cell types. This is particularly relevant with regard to advanced liver fibrosis in
humans, as most hepatocellular carcinomas originate from underlying cirrhotic liver tissue.
Secondly, owing to the critical role of TGFβ1 in immunosuppression (TGFβ1 null mice die
at an early age from massive multi-organ inflammation51,52, generalized blockade of TGFβ
activity may also lead to excessive autoimmunity and inflammation which could be highly
detrimental in a patient with advanced fibrosis and limited organ reserve. Therefore
inhibition of TGFβ1 signaling at specific sites, via inhibition of specific integrins, may yield
the desired anti-fibrotic effects without the unwanted side-effects of pan-TGFβ blockade.
Specific blocking antibodies to αvβ6 have shown therapeutic promise in a wide range of
pre-clinical models of fibrosis including lung fibrosis20,53, renal fibrosis43,44 and peri-biliary
fibrosis37,54. Furthermore, in the lung low doses of αvβ6 blocking antibodies can prevent
bleomycin-induced or radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice, without causing
inflammation20,53. A monoclonal antibody targeting αvβ6 (clone 6.3G9) has been
humanized as STX-100, and is currently being evaluated in phase 2 clinical trials for the
treatment of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. As noted above, pre-clinical data
also suggest that targeting α3β1, αvβ3, αvβ5, αvβ8 or the β1 integrin on fibroblasts that
regulate cutaneous fibrosis could hold promise for treatment of fibrotic diseases, however
much less is currently known about the risk/benefit ratios of any of these interventions.
Conclusions
In recent years it has become apparent that integrins have profound effects on fibrosis in
multiple organs. There is now abundant in vivo data demonstrating critical regulatory roles
for integrins expressed on different cell types during the fibrotic process. The component

parts of tissue fibrogenesis are exquisitely complex, and these studies highlight the
important cross-talk between epithelia, tissue myofibroblasts and the cells of the immune
system during the evolution and resolution of fibrosis. Strategies to manipulate integrins,
such as antibody blockade and small molecule inhibitors, will hopefully yield effective anti￾fibrotic therapies.

Figure 1. Mechanisms of integrin-mediated regulation of lung fibrosis
α3β1-mediated promotion of myofibroblast formation: In uninjured alveolar epithelial cells
α3β1 co-localises with TGFβ receptor I (TBRI), E-cadherin and β-catenin. In the presence
of TGFβ1, α3 integrin is required for β-catenin phosphorylation at tyrosine residue 654
(Y654), which is necessary for formation of a pY654-β-catenin/p-SMAD2 complex. This
pY654-β-catenin/p-SMAD2 complex then translocates to the nucleus and induces EMT
(epithelial-mesenchymal transition). αvβ6-mediated activation of latent TGFβ: αvβ6 binds
to the RGD sequence in the LAP of TGFβ1 and 3. This complex is tethered by a disulfide
linkage to LTBP1, which is essential for TGFβ activation. Binding alone is insufficient to
activate latent complexes. Activation requires extracellular signals that lead to epithelial cell
contraction and induction of a conformational change in the latent complex. This
conformational change presents the active site on the mature TGFβ dimer to TGFβ receptors
on adjacent cells, such as fibroblasts.
