ABSTRAa. Metabolism of propionate in human subjects 
was studied using bolus administration of l-'3C-propionate 
i.v. or orally. The study population consisted of five patients 
with propionic acidemia (PA), eight with methylmalonic 
acidemia (MMA, four responsive to vitamin BIZ), one each 
with multiple carboxylase deficiency and transcobalamin￾I1 deficiency, and five healthy volunteers. Concentrations 
of I-I3C-propionate were measured in blood in three pa￾tients with PA, two with MMA, and two controls. Breath 
samples were obtained at intervals during 3 h after the 
dose, isotopic enrichment of I3CO2 was measured, and the 
cumulative percentage of recovery of I3C was calculated 
from the individual's predicted resting energy expenditure. 
Recovery of I3CO2 and half-time of I-I3C-propionate in PA 
were significantly less than normal. The same parameters 
in MMA were below normal, but significantly greater than 
in PA. Recovery of I3CO2 was well correlated with clinical 
severity in PA, but did not correlate in MMA. Differences 
between MMA and PA may indicate different distribution 
of propionate pools, differences in inducibility of residual 
enzyme activities, or an alternate pathway for decarboxyl￾ation of propionate available in MMA but not PA. Only 
one patient with PA demonstrated increased 13C02 produc￾tion during biotin treatment. In a B12-responsive MMA 
patient, no differences were noted within 2 d of initiating 
treatment with BIZ, but there was an increase in I3CO2 
production after 4 mo. Recovery of I3CO2 was normal in 
the patient with transcobalamin-I1 deficiency before and 
after treatment with vitamin B17. e - In the ~atient with mul￾tiple carboxylase deficiency, 13C02 generation was nearly 
normal while he was receiving his maintenance dose of 
biotin, and was not significantly changed after 3 and 7 d 
without biotin treatment, despite a decrease of 30% in 
lymphocyte propionyl-CoA carboxylase activity. (Pediatr

Disorders of propionate metabolism are potentially life-threat￾ening conditions that present a considerable heterogeneity of 
clinical manifestations, particularly evident in the tolerance to 
protein and response to pharmacologic doses of biotin or vitamin 
BI2 Propionyl-CoA in human metabolism arises from the amino 
acids isoleucine, valine, threonine, and methionine, and to lesser 
extents from cholesterol and odd-chain length fatty acids. An 
additional source is propionate-producing bacteria in the gut. 
Propionyl-CoA is carboxylated by PCC, and the resulting s￾methylmalonyl-CoA is converted by methylmalonyl-CoA race￾mase to R-methylmalonyl-CoA, which is isomerized by methyl￾malonyl-CoA mutase to succinyl-CoA, which is then oxidized in 
the tricarboxylic acid cycle to yield C02. In human disease, this 
pathway may be blocked at either the PCC or mutase steps. PA 
may arise from a defective PCC apoenzyme or from deficient 
holoenzyme formation, as in MCD due to holocarboxylase syn￾thetase or biotinidase deficiency. MMA may arise from an altered 
mutase apoenzyme, from disordered cobalamin metabolism, 
which may give rise to MMA alone or in conjunction with 
homocystinuria, or from B12 deficiency, including that arising 
from TC-I1 deficiency. 
Vitamin BIZ can be lifesaving in certain complementation 
groups of MMA (I), and B12 is highly effective in TC-I1 deficiency 
(2). Treatment of MCD (3) and biotinidase deficiency (4) with 
biotin has been uniformly effective. There has been no evidence 
that patients with PA have improved clinically by treatment with 
biotin. However, reports that biotin treatment lowers the re￾sponse of serum propionate concentrations to an isoleucine load 
(5) and increases cellular activity of PCC (6) provide an argument 
for testing the effects of biotin on each patient with PA. 
Recent studies (7, 8) have established the utility of 1-I3C￾propionate for estimating the rate of propionate oxidation in vivo 
through the rate of I3CO2 evolution, and have indicated that the 

16 BARSHOP ET AL. 
estimated oxidative rate can be of prognostic value. Our study 
was undertaken to explore the use of bolus administration of 1- 
I"-propionate as an adjunct in the evaluation of metabolic 
capacity in vivo, to compare the oxidation of propionate in 
patients with various defects of propionate metabolism, and to 
determine whether this methodology could be useful in evaluat￾ing vitamin responsiveness. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Materials. Sodium l-13C-propionate (90 atom % I3C) was 
purchased from MSD Isotopes, Pointe Claire-Dorval, Quebec, 
Canada or (99 atom % 13C) was provided by Tracer Technologies, 
Somerville, MA. 2H6-propioni~ acid (98 atom % 2H) was pur￾chased from KOR Isotopes, Cambridge, MA. Sodium propionate 
was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO. Glass￾distilled chloroform preserved with amylene was purchased from 
Burdick and Jackson Laboratories, Inc., Muskegon, MI; Bio-Sil 
A (200-400 mesh) silicic acid from Bio-Rad Laboratories, Rich￾mond, CA; and Chromosorb 102 (60-80 mesh) for gas chrom￾otography from Supelco, Bellefonte, PA. Twenty-mL evacuated 
tubes for collection of breath samples were non-silicon-coated 
Venoject tubes from Terumo Medical Corp., Elkton, MD. 
Subjects. This research was approved by the University of 
California Human Subjects Committee, and informed consent 
was obtained from all patients or their parents. The patient 
population and sequence of tests are presented in Table 1. The 
patients studied included five with PA and six with MMA, of 
which three were responsive to vitamin BI2. Unless otherwise 
indicated, biotin was administered at 10 mg/d orally, vitamin 
BI2 was given as 1 mg/d cyanocobalamin intramuscularly, and 
carnitine was given as 100 mg/kg orally, divided into two or 
three doses per day. All of the patients had not had an episode 
of acute acidosis for at least 1 mo before the studies, and all were 
well at the time of study, with two exceptions enumerated below. 
Patient L.S. developed a florid varicella eruption days after her 
first study and was convalescent at the time of the second study, 
while taking biotin. In one of the B12-responsive patients with 
MMA (S.H.), the first I3C-propionate breath tests were performed 
immediately before and 3 d after the initial trial of vitamin B12, 
but his course during the initial days of therapy was complicated 
by a febrile illness, and his urinary methylmalonic acid excretion 
increased from 19 to 92 ~mol/mg creatinine despite the initiation 
of intramuscular cyanocobalamin. Subsequently, his responsive￾ness to B12 was evident and his diagnosis was confirmed by 
enzyme assay of cultured fibroblasts. He was tested again after 4 
mo of ongoing oral cyanocobalamin therapy (1 mg/d), at which 
time he was in good health. One patient (A.F.) (3, 10) with MCD 
was studied who had a defective activity of holocarboxylase 
synthetase. His Km for biotin was higher than that of any of the 
other patients studied (3), and his clinical response to biotin was 
less complete than that of any of the other patients. He was 
studied while receiving 75 mg of biotin p.0. per day and at three 
and seven days after cessation of treatment with biotin. One 
patient with TC-I1 deficiency (M.W.) (2) was studied immediately 
before and after 1 mo of B,2 treatment, an interval over which 
her excretion of methylmalonate decreased from 13.3 to 0.14 
Frnol/mg creatinine. 
Standard metabolic analyses. Urinary organic acids were 
quantified by the method of Hoffmann et al. (1 I). Lymphocyte 
carboxylase activities were assayed as previously described (12). 
Biotin in plasma and urine was determined immunochemically 
(Le TP, Sweetman L, Nyhan WL, unpublished data). 
Studies of metabolism of sodium I-13C-propionate in vivo. 
Sodium 1-I3C-propionate was freshly dissolved in sterile water to 
make a 60 mmol/L solution, sterilized by filtration, and admin￾istered i.v. at 30 pmollkg or orally at 100 Frnol/kg body weight. 
The control individuals and the patients over the age of 3 were 
fasted overnight, and the other patients were fasted 3 h before 
the test; all were fasting during the tests. The subjects reclined in 
bed or engaged in quiet play throughout the period of collection 
of blood and breath samples. Blood samples of 3-5 mL were 
collected in acid citrate-dextrose solution for measurement of 
carboxylases in patients with PA or MCD. In six of the subjects, 
samples of heparinized blood (0.5 mL) were collected for deter￾mination of 1-"C-propionic acid before giving the isotope and 
at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, and 90 min after the isotope. The 
blood samples were placed on ice and then frozen at -20°C until 
analyzed. Two breath samples were obtained before the admin￾istration of the isotope and at 15-min intervals for 3 h after i.v. 
injection or 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120, 150, and 
180 min after oral administration. Fifty mL of end-respiratory 
breath samples were collected in a syringe with a three-way 
stopcock from a Haldane tube in the older subjects and from a 
face mask in the younger subjects. The breath samples were 
transferred to duplicate evacuated tubes and kept at room tem￾perature until analysis. 
Measurement of I2C- and I3C-propionic acid in blood. The 
method of Bachmann et al. (13) for the quantitation of short￾chain fatty acids in plasma by adsorption to silicic acid and 
elution with chloroform was modified by the use of an internal 
standard of 2H5-propionic acid and GCMS. To 0.4-mL samples 
of whole blood or plasma was added 25 pL of 2 pmol/L 2H6- 
propionic acid (98 atom % 2H) in 0.35 mol/L LiOH. The carboxy 
deuterium of 2H6-propionic acid exchanges with the large 
amount of water to give Li.2H5-propionate. The samples, con￾taining 50 nmol of 2H5-propioni~ acid, were acidified to pH less 
than 1 with 25 pL of 6 M sulfuric acid, 1 g of Bio-Sil A was 
stirred in to give a free-flowing powder that was poured onto a 
0.6-cm inner diameter X 15-cm glass column, and the column 
was filled with chloroform. Chloroform was pumped through 
the column at a flow rate of 2.5 mL/min for 6 min and the 
emuent was collected in vials containing 100 pL of 0.1 M LiOH 
in nanograde methanol. The alkaline effluent was evaporated in 
a stream of nitrogen to a small volume and transferred to 1.5- 
mL snap-cap conical tubes by rinsing with methanol, and the 
samples were dried completely in nitrogen, capped, and stored 
at -20°C. For analysis by GCMS, the samples were dissolved in 
50 pL of 0.6 M HCl. Blank samples of distilled water were carried 
through the entire procedure to obtain corrections for the small 
amount of propionic acid in Bio-Sil A and chloroform. 
Standards for GCMS were prepared that contained 0 to 250 
nmol of sodium propionate (90 atom % I3C) and 50 nmol of Li. 
2H5-propionate in 50 pL of 0.6 M HCl. A Finnigan (Sunnyvale, 
CA) model no. 402 1 gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer with 
an INCOS data system was used for (SIM) chemical ionization 
GCMS analysis of propionic acid, l-13C-propionic acid, and 'Hs￾propionic acid. Analyses were done on a GC column 2 mm 
inner diameter x 180 cm packed with Chromosorb 102 (60-80 
mesh) with phosphoric acid-treated glass wool at the outlet end. 
The injector temperature was 200°C, the column temperature 
180"C, and the direct transfer line to the MS source 280°C. The 
GC carrier gas was methane, which also served as the chemical 
ionization reagent gas, and the flow rate was 25 mL/min, with a 
pressure of 0.07-0.08 torr in the source. The ionizing voltage 
was 70 eV. Propionic acid eluted at about 5 min. For the injection 
of solutions of propionic acid, 1 pL of 0.6 M HCl was drawn 
into the syringe and then 2 pL of propionic acid in 0.6 M HC1. 
Between each sample 3 pL of 0.6 M HCl was injected twice to 
clean the column. The solvent fronts were diverted away from 
the source. 
For SIM quantitation, the m/z were 75 for propionic acid, 76 
for l-13C-propionic acid, and 80 for 2H5-propioni~ acid. The 
dwell time for each mass was 100 ms. Peak areas of the SIM 
chromatograms were calculated by the computer with the base￾line points selected by the operator. For each day's analysis, 
standard curves for propionic acid and l-13C-propionic acid (90 
atom % 13C) were determined. Linearity was excellent and the 
standard curve of the ratio of areas at m/z 75 to m/z 80 for I2C￾propionic acid versus nmol of 2Hs-propionic acid was fitted by

linear regression and used to calculate the concentration of I2C￾propionic acid in the samples of blood. Similarly, the standard 
curve of the ratio of areas at m/z 76 to m/z 80 was used to 
calculate the concentration of '3C-propionic acid in the samples 
of blood. The experimentally determined natural abundance of 
'"-propionic acid was 2.70 atom %. The blood samples were 
analyzed and the atom % 13C-propionic acid was calculated as 
(nmol "C-propionic acid)/(nmol "C-propionic acid + nmol 12C￾propionic acid). APE I3C was obtained by subtracting the natural 
abundance. The l-13C-propionic acid injected in these studies 
was determined to be 89.8 atom % I3C. 
Measurement of1"02 in expired air. The '3C02/12C02 ratio 
in breath samples was measured by Tracer Technologies 
(Somerville, MA) using a VG-ISOGAS SIRA-10 ratio mass 
spectrometer. The APE of '"02 was derived from a comparison 
of ion currents at m/z 44, 45, and 46 (including correction for 
oxygen isotopes) relative to a standard sample (calibrated to Pee 
Dee Belemnite limestone). Access to an indirect calorimeter was 
not available throughout these studies, so each subject's endog￾enous Vco2 was estimated based upon predicted REE. The REE 
(kcal/h) was calculated using the Bateman formula and coefi￾cients derived (14) to describe published (15) age- and sex￾dependent basal metabolic rates (kcal/m2. h) and an estimate of 
body surface area (BSA) based on weight and height according 
to the Dubois formula (16). Endogenous C02 production was 
calculated from the REE assuming a RQ of 0.83 (L C02/L 02), 
a heat production of 4.83 kcal/L 02 (1 5), and a density of 44.6 
mmol C02/L at 37°C and 1 atm. Because the basal metabolic 
rate (BMR) applies only under specific conditions (awake, su￾pine, calm, postabsorptive) that are not always feasible during 
testing of subjects of the pediatric age group, an activity factor 
correction is desirable under these experimental conditions (sub- 

18 BARSHOP ET AL. 
jects engaged in sedentary activity). Based upon indirect calorim￾etry, energy expenditure in adult subjects confined to bed and 
out of bed ranges from 1.2 to 1.3 times the basal rate (17), and 
similar measurements in another series (18) yielded an activity 
factor of 1.23 k 0.08. Accordingly, we used an activity factor of 
1.25 in the present study, and calculated Vco2 (mmol/min) as 
VCO~ = BMR/60 X BSA X (0.83 X 44.6)/4.83 X 1.25 
The rate of 13C02 production is normalized to % dose/h, 
calculated as 
% dose/h = APE 
x Vco2/(60 x mmol IT administered) x 100 
To calculate the cumulative percent dose excreted, the area under 
the curve of APE versus t was numerically integrated with cubic 
splines, using algorithms of the International Mathematics and 
Statistics Library (Chicago, IL). The cumulative percent dose 
excreted at time t, CPD(t), is then 
CPD(t) = Vco2 x APE(t)/(mmol I3C administered) x 100 lt 
Calculated spline curves were also used to determine the maxi￾mum values for % dose/h and times of maxima, as presented 
below. 
RESULTS 
Concentrations of I-13C-propionate in blood and half-lives. 
Blood propionate concentrations were measured in three patients 
with PA, two with MMA, the patient with MCD, and two control 
subjects (Table 1). Among the patients with PA, the concentra￾tions of I2C-propionate in blood before administration of I3C￾propionate were 2.5 to 100 times the mean control levels. The 
19- to 41-fold lower concentrations in patient P.S. than in E.A. 
were considered to reflect an excellent level of control in a 
rigorously compliant family. The concentrations of propionate 
were between 5-fold and 16-fold above the control mean in L.S., 
the patient with somewhat milder manifestations of PA; however, 
the second value was obtained during resolution of a varicella 
infection. The blood propionate concentrations in C.H., a patient 
with classic MMA, were as high as typical values from patients 
with PA, whereas in J.B., the patient with much milder B12- 
unresponsive MMA, the concentrations were only approximately 
2.5 times control. 
The half-life of 13C-propionate was between 4 and 5 min in 
each of the three control experiments carried out. Virtually 
identical results were obtained in A.F., the patient with MCD. 
In the patients with PA, the values ranged from about 3 to 7 
times greater than control. The half-times in the two patients 
with MMA were shorter than in PA, and that was true even 
when comparing patient C.H. to patient P.S., although C.H. had 
zero-time propionate concentrations 2.5 to 4 times greater than 
P.S. Pool sizes were estimated for the patients with vitamin￾unresponsive PA or MMA from the natural logarithm of APE 
"C-propionic acid extrapolated to zero time. Pool sizes were 
undefined in the control patients and the patient with MCD, 
because the extrapolated zero-time APE was greater than the 
APE of the infused I3C-propionic acid (reflecting the great excess 
of the bolus relative to the pool and the noninstantaneousness 
of infusion). Turnover of propionate in the patients, estimated 
from the pool sizes and slopes of the first-order curves, ranged 
from 0.41-4.98 pmol/min/kg. This is comparable to the values 
of 0.92-3.10 pmol/min/kg found for five patients with MMA 
studied with continuous infusion of labeled propionic acid (1 9). 
Conversion of l-13C-propionate to I3CO2. The time course of 
isotopic enrichment of I3C in expired C02 after i.v. and oral 
administration of 1-13C-propionate is shown in Figure 1. In 
control individuals, the conversion to I3CO2 was rapid, with the 
greatest enrichment observed at 15 min or less after i.v. admin￾istration. There was very little difference between the time 
courses after i.v. or oral administration, although the maximum 
enrichment was slightly later when the tracer was given orally. 
There was very little generation of I3CO2 in patients with PA, 
and the curves were virtually flat. The I3CO2 enrichment curves 
in patients with MMA were flatter than those for control subjects, 
but there was significantly more generation of I3CO2 than there 
was in patients with PA. With only one exception (patient L.S. 
on biotin), the highest cumulative percent dose expired for any 
patient with PA was below the lowest value for any patient with 
MMA. The recovery of I3CO2 correlated negatively with clinical 
severity (9) in subjects with PA, as shown in Figure 2. The 
regression coefficient of -0.849 was highly significant statisti￾cally. In contrast, the recovery of I3CO2 did not correlate with 
clinical severity of MMA. The results were indistinguishable from 
normal in the patient with TC-I1 deficiency before B12 treatment, 
at a time when she was excreting modest but distinctly abnormal 
quantities of methylmalonate. 
Effects of biotin, vitamin B12, and carnitine. In the patients 
with PA whose blood propionate concentrations were measured, 
there appeared to be no real difference in the concentrations of 
propionate in the blood or in the half-life of 13C-propionate 
before and after treatment with biotin (Table I). In L.S., the 
patient with somewhat milder PA, the concentration of propio￾nate appeared to correlate with the status of her varicella rather 
than to be an effect of biotin. Nevertheless, the conversion of 1- 
I3C-propionate to 13C02 was increased in L.S. during biotin 
treatment (from 21.7 to 30.5% at 3 h), whereas in all of the other 
patients with PA there was no appreciable change in the extent 
of conversion with biotin. Also, among the patients with PA, the 
lymphocyte carboxylase activities increased only in L.S. after 
treatment with biotin (Table 2). 
In the two patients with BI2-unresponsive MMA whose blood 
propionate concentrations were studied, the half-life of propio￾nate and the conversion of 1-I3C-propionate to I3CO2 were 
virtually identical in the presence and absence of vitamin B12 
(Table 1). In the patients with apparent mitochondria1 cobalamin 
reductase deficiency, T.C., T.J., and C.F., who were first studied 
after 2 wk, 4 mo, and 10 y of oral cyanocobalamin treatment, 
respectively, the recoveries of I3CO2 were among the highest for 
patients with MMA. S.H. was the only patient with MMA with 
whom there was an opportunity to test I3CO2 production before 
and after initiation of vitamin B12 treatment. After 3 d of intra￾muscular cyanocobalamin, there was no improvement in his 
apparent 1-I3C-propionate oxidation, although that was a time 
when his course was complicated by a febrile illness. However, 
there appeared to be a modest increase in I3CO2 recovery and a 
distinct increase in maximum enrichment after 4 mo of treat￾ment with oral cyanocobalamin. 
In A.F., the patient with MCD, the half-time of blood 1-I3C￾propionate at 5 and 7 d after cessation of biotin therapy approx￾imated the control value. Similarly, the cumulative percent of 
I3CO2 formation at 180 min indicated that the overall metabo￾lism of propionate in vivo did not change in 7 d without biotin. 
In contrast, the concentration of biotin in plasma and urine 
declined sharply during the period of study (Table 3). The half￾life of the initial loss from the major biotin pool as measured in 
plasma or urine was 1.5 to 2 d. The plasma carboxylase activities 
were never normal. At the start, the values for PCC, 3-methyl￾crotonyl-CoA carboxylase, and pyruvate carboxylase were 16, 
15, and 13%, respectively, compared to simultaneously measured 
controls. Furthermore, they did not change very much during 
the course of the study. By 7 d without biotin, the levels of PCC 
and 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase were 13 and 16% of 
control, respectively. The activity of pyruvate carboxylase de￾clined to a greater degree, to 7.4% of control on d 4 and to 5.0% 
on d 7. The levels of urinary organic acids were maintained at 
close to the initial levels, but there was a gradual increase in the 
urinary content of 3-methylcrotonylglycine, 3-hydroxyisovaler￾ate, and methylcitrate.

This study design provides an estimate of relative propionate 
oxidation with a minimum of bedside procedures, but there are 
certain considerations that limit the interpretation of the data, 
in particular the use of Vco2 predictions and the bolus adminis￾Table 2. Lymphocyte carboxylase activities in subjects with PA*

sible to perform some of these studies at locations remote from 
a major medical center. 
All previous studies of I3C-propionate metabolism in vivo in 
patients with disorders of propionate metabolism have used the 
method of continuous tracer infusion. The bolus method as used 
here has distinct advantages in terms of noninvasiveness and 
acceptance by patients' families. In principle, it also permits the 
resolution of processes with different kinetic constants. However, 
there are certain assumptions that affect the kinetic interpretation 
of bolus tracer studies and that are difficult to validate. These 
limitations have been well discussed (e.g. reference 20). Of par￾ticular concern are 1) the requirement that the tracer mix with 
the primary pool rapidly relative to its rate of metabolism, 2) the 
requirement that the product move from the metabolic site to 
the sampling site rapidly with respect to the time of the sampling, 
3) the fact that the tracee pool size will affect the enrichment of 
tracer, and 4) the possibility that a bolus of a relatively large 
amount of substrate will induce or stimulate residual enzyme or 
enzymes of alternate pathways. Because the first two assumptions 
cannot be validated with the available data, this study cannot be 
used to estimate the actual rate of propionate oxidation. The 
observed rate of I3CO2 appearance includes undefined kinetic 
terms of substrate distribution and transport. Nevertheless, the 
recovery of I3C should provide an index of the relative efficiency 
of propionate utilization, inasmuch as tracer mixing and I3CO2 
excretion are not slow in the 3-h time scale of sampling (manifest 
by the return of 13C02 enrichment to near baseline). It is assumed 
that the retention of I3CO3- in slowly exchanging pools (21), 
which could account for up to 25% of the generated 13C02 (22, 
23), is similar in all patient groups. The proportion of C02 release 
in expired air does not appear to be affected by protein intake in 
the neonate (24). 
To address the effect of tracee pool size comprehensively will 
require more extensive blood propionate analyses than have been 
performed in this study to date. At least a part of the calculated 
decrease in I3C recovery in the patients with increased propionate 
pools may arise from the dilution of the tracer. However, the 
observed differences in recovery between the patients with MMA 
and PA, taken as groups, are not likely to arise from differences 
in pool sizes (e.g. compare patients P.S. and C.H. in Table 1). 
Furthermore, there is a distinct delay of the appearance of I3CO2 
in PA patients with respect to MMA patients (Fig. 3). Although 
pool size would affect isotope recovery (decrease the cumulative 
percent dose), it should not affect the kinetic constants (alter the 
time of maximum l3CO2 enrichment). Other possibilities to 
explain the differences between MMA and PA are that 1) the 
rates of tracer mixing and/or substrate ingress or product egress 
at the mitochondrion are different (unlikely), 2) residual meth￾ylmalonyl-CoA mutase but not PCC is inducible, or 3) an 
alternate pathway of propionate decarboxylation is operant un￾der these conditions in MMA but not in PA.

patients with PA were so flat compared to those for controls that 
it appears likely that a different process or alternate pathway for 
the oxidation of propionate is involved in these patients. Abnor￾mal oxidation of propionate to expiratory C02 was also observed 
in patients with pernicious anemia given 2-I4C-labeled propio￾nate (25), and the kinetics observed in that study suggested the 
presence of two pathways, one prominent in normal individuals 
and another slower process assumed to arise from the poxidation 

I3C-PROPIONA TE METABOLISM 21 
of propionyl-CoA to acrylyl-CoA (26), the pathway that appears 
to give rise to 3-hydroxypropionate in patients with PA (27). The 
slow rate of J3C02 production observed in the patients with P A 
in our study probably does arise from f)-oxidation of propionyl￾CoA. However, the rate of J3C02 production from I-J3C-propi￾onate that we observed in patients with MMA was very much 
greater than that observed in the patients with PA and must arise 
from yet another pathway or process. It is difficult to imagine 
that the net oxidation of propionate in patients with MMA is 
greatly enhanced relative to those with PA because the blood 
propionate concentrations and pool sizes in the former patients 
may be as high as those in the latter, as shown in Table I and in 
the data from the study of Thompson el al. (7). However, it is 
possible that nonoxidative loss of J3C02 could arise from isotope 
exchange through racemization of methylmalonate. The 1_ J3C_ 
s-methylmalonyl-CoA formed from l-J3C-propionate is in equi￾librium with I-J3C-R-methylmalonyl-CoA through methylma￾10nyl-CoA through methylmalonyl-CoA racemase (26), and if 
the CoA moiety is transferred between the carboxylates ofmeth￾ylmalonate (concertedly or sequentially), 3-13
C-s-methylma￾10nyl-CoA would be formed, from which J3C02 would be released 
through PCC, which is known to be readily reversible (28). 
Indeed, isotope exchange between the I and 3 carbons of meth￾ylmalonyl-CoA has been demonstrated in the rat (29), where 
evidence was presented for sequential deesterification and rees￾terification of methylmalonate. However, data cited by Thomp￾son el al. (8) showed only a small amount of 2H3-propionate in 
only one of four children with MMA who were given continuous 
infusion of 2Hs-propionate. This would indicate that recycling 
by isotope exchange is not significant under the conditions of 
continuous infusion, but it is possible that this mechanism 
becomes kinetically significant only at the higher concentrations 
achieved in the present studies when the tracer was given as a 
bolus. It is possible that further studies of patients with MMA 
administered 2-J3C-propionate to eliminate J3C02 generation 
from isotope scrambling might distinguish that process from 
oxidation. 
It is not clear from the available data whether the present 
methodology can discern an effect of cobalamin treatment in 
Bl2-responsive MMA. There was no effect on 13C02 production 
after 2 d of BJ2 treatment in patient S.H. but there was an 
increase of about 25% after 4 mo of treatment. Unfortunately, 
we did not have the opportunity to test other Bl2-responsive 
MMA patients before and after Bl2 treatment or to test patient 
S.H. at more dates early in his therapy. The data from vitamin 
Bll-deficient patients given 2-14
C-propionate (25) indicated that 
changes in propionate oxidation occurred later than changes in 
methylmalonic acid excretion or hematologic abnormalities. 
In the patient with biotin-responsive MCD due to deficiency 
of holocarboxylase synthetase, the metabolism of 1-l3C-propio￾nate was close to normal as measured by its half-life or its 
conversion to expiratory CO2, and it remained so for 7 dafter 
the cessation of biotin therapy. This was true even though the 
activity of PCC was only about 15% of the control level. The 
data provide information on how little carboxylase activity is 
required for normal metabolism of propionate. This sort of data 
could be of utility in the design of gene therapy, if that modality 
should become available for the management of human disease. 
These studies do not provide the answer as to how long a patient 
with MCD can go without biotin before propionate metabolism 
becomes abnormal, although they do indicate that 7 d is at least 
a minimum. This is probably a function of the half-life of the 
holocarboxylase itself, inasmuch as the levels of biotin decline 
promptly, with a half-life of 2 d or less. Among the carboxylases, 
the activity of pyruvate carboxylase appeared to decline more 
rapidly than that of PCC or 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase. 
There was no significant effect of biotin on the half-life of 1-
LlC-propionate or its conversion to 13C02 in any but one of the 
patients with PA. This is in contrast with the observations of 
Wolf (6), who reported a significant increase in PCC activity in 
white cells of seven of eight patients with PA treated with 5-10 
mg/d of biotin. In L.S., the single patient in whom an increased 
production of 13C02 was noted, the improved recovery was still 
as low as in the untreated or Bl 2-unresponsive patients with 
MMA, and her urinary excretion of hydroxy propionic and meth￾ylcitric acid did not change significantly despite the biotin treat￾ment. 
It is interesting to compare these results with those studies 
using continuous infusion of I-DC-propionate in similar patients 
(7, 8, 20). When studied by the continuous infusion method, 
there was little difference in J3C02 generation between patients 
with P A and those with MMA. In fact, there was considerable 
overlap with control populations. In contrast, after bolus admin￾istration there was no overlap of either disease population with 
controls and there was only one (posttreatment) overlap of the 
patients with PA with those with MMA. This may indicate 
differences in propionate pool distributions in P A and MMA or 
differences in inducibility of PCC and methylmalonyl-CoA mu￾tase, or may reflect a role of free methylmalonate in the normal 
metabolism of propionate in man. In patients with PA, the 
recovery of l3C in breath after a bolus dose correlates with clinical 
severity as does the plateau enrichment in the more demanding 
continuous infusion method (7). Bolus administration appears 
to better distinguish disposal of 1-13
C-propionate in PA from 
normal than does continuous infusion (7). Constant infusion 
studies have provided the important finding that a significant 
amount of residual activity is present in patients with MMA and 
PA, as well as phenylketonuria (20), with apparent oxidation 
rates that may be equal to control rates. However, even if ascribed 
to induction by high substrate concentrations, the apparently 
normal steady state enzyme activities do not explain the origin 
of the high concentrations. Because the differences in 13C02 
generation may correspond more closely to differences in maxi￾mal velocities, there would appear to be a role for bolus tracer 
studies in determining metabolic capacities in biochemical dis￾eases and their responses to therapy.
