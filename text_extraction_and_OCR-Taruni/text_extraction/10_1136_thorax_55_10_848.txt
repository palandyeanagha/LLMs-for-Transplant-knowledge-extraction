Abstract
BACKGROUND Enzymatic and histochemical abnormalities of the
peripheral muscle may play a role in exercise intolerance in patients
with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A study was
undertaken to measure the mitochondrial enzyme activity of the
vastus lateralis muscle in patients with COPD and to evaluate the
relationship between enzyme activities and functional status.
METHODS Fifty seven patients with COPD of mean (SD) age 66 (7)
years with forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 39 (15)%
predicted and peak oxygen uptake (V˙o 2) of 14 (4) ml/min/kg and
15 normal subjects of similar age were included in the study. Each
subject performed a stepwise exercise test up to maximal capacity
during which five-breath averages of V˙o 2were measured. Muscle
specimens were obtained by percutaneous needle biopsy of the
vastus lateralis muscle and the activity of two mitochondrial
enzymes (citrate synthase (CS) and 3-hydroxyacyl CoA
dehydrogenase (HADH)) was measured. The functional status of the
patients was classified according to peakV˙o 2.
RESULTS CS and HADH activities were markedly reduced in
patients with COPD compared with normal subjects (22.3 (2.7)
versus 29.5 (7.3) μmol/min/g muscle (p<0.0001) and 5.1 (2.0)
versus 6.7 (1.9) μmol/min/g muscle (p<0.005), respectively). The
activity of CS decreased progressively with the deterioration in the
functional status while that of HADH was not related to functional
status. Using a stepwise regression analysis, percentage predicted
functional residual capacity (FRC), the activity of CS, oxygen
desaturation during exercise, age, and inspiratory capacity (% pred)
were found to be significant determinants of peakV˙o 2. The
regression model explained 59% of the variance in peak V˙o 2
(p<0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS The oxidative capacity of the vastus lateralis


muscle is reduced in patients with moderate to severe COPD
compared with normal subjects of similar age. In these individuals
the activity of CS correlated significantly with peak exercise
capacity and independently of lung function impairment.
