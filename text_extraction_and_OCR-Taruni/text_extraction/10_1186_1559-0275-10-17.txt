Abstract
Background: Serine hydrolases constitute a large enzyme family involved in a diversity of proteolytic and
metabolic processes which are essential for many aspects of normal physiology. The roles of serine hydrolases in
renal function are largely unknown and monitoring their activity may provide important insights into renal
physiology. The goal of this study was to profile urinary serine hydrolases with activity-based protein profiling
(ABPP) and to perform an in-depth compositional analysis.
Methods: Eighteen healthy individuals provided random, mid-stream urine samples. ABPP was performed by reacting
urines (n = 18) with a rhodamine-tagged fluorophosphonate probe and visualizing on SDS-PAGE. Active serine
hydrolases were isolated with affinity purification and identified on MS-MS. Enzyme activity was confirmed with
substrate specific assays. A complementary 2D LC/MS-MS analysis was performed to evaluate the composition of serine
hydrolases in urine.
Results: Enzyme activity was closely, but not exclusively, correlated with protein quantity. Affinity purification and
MS/MS identified 13 active serine hydrolases. The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and calcium channel (TRPV5)
regulators, tissue kallikrein and plasmin were identified in active forms, suggesting a potential role in regulating sodium
and calcium reabsorption in a healthy human model. Complement C1r subcomponent-like protein, mannan binding
lectin serine protease 2 and myeloblastin (proteinase 3) were also identified in active forms. The in-depth compositional
analysis identified 62 serine hydrolases in urine independent of activity state.
Conclusions: This study identified luminal regulators of electrolyte homeostasis in an active state in the urine, which
suggests tissue kallikrein and plasmin may be functionally relevant in healthy individuals. Additional serine hydrolases
were identified in an active form that may contribute to regulating innate immunity of the urinary tract. Finally, the
optimized ABPP technique in urine demonstrates its feasibility, reproducibility and potential applicability to profiling
urinary enzyme activity in different renal physiological and pathophysiological conditions.

Background
Detailed knowledge of the composition and activities of
urine proteins could provide novel insights into normal
renal physiology. Although proteomic studies have iden￾tified a large number of urinary proteins [1-4] their func￾tional relevance remains largely unknown. Furthermore,
many proteomic studies do not account for post-translational
modifications which may have a significant impact on pro￾tein function. Many proteins are enzymes that are main￾tained in a latent state until their activity is required. This
allows for rapid host responses, without the time lag re￾quired for transcription and translation. Thus, there can
be marked changes in functional states in the absence of
significant alteration in concentration. These functional
changes in activity are undetectable with methods that
simply quantify transcript or protein levels, but are im￾portant for characterizing the dynamic physiological status
of the host.

Activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) is a novel ap￾proach to assess the functional status of selected en￾zymes in the proteome [5]. ABPP is based on the use of
tagged probes that selectively react with the active sites
of a given enzyme or family of enzymes [5,6]. Activity￾based probes consist of a reactive group that targets the
active residue of the enzyme, a short linker and reporter
tag. The central premise of ABPP is that accessibility of
substrate to the active site of an enzyme is an indicator
of enzyme activation. Because the underlying molecular
mechanisms of catalysis by members of an enzyme fam￾ily are often identical [7] it is possible to develop a single
probe to detect the active forms of members from a
given family [8,9]. Members of the serine hydrolase fam￾ily share a serine centric charge relay system in their
catalytic site and this common feature can be exploited
with an activity-based probe to selectively label active
serine hydrolases. Furthermore, probe-labeled enzymes
can be affinity-purified through their tag and identified
by mass spectrometry to determine the specific active
enzymes within a biological sample (Figure 1).
The serine hydrolase family is one of the largest en￾zyme classes in humans and constitutes ~1% of pre￾dicted protein products from the eukaryotic genome.
Serine hydrolases consist of greater than 100 serine
proteases and approximately 110 esterases, lipases, pep￾tidases and amidases [10]. While some members are
well-characterized (e.g. trypsin, elastase, thrombin, acetyl￾cholinesterase), many have yet to be described [10].
Indeed the role for ~50% of the non-serine proteases re￾mains undetermined [10], and very little is known about
the presence and role of serine hydrolases in the urine of
healthy individuals. Therefore the objective of this study
was to evaluate the activity and composition of serine hy￾drolases in normal urine.
Thirteen serine hydrolases were identified in an active
form in normal urine that may reflect regulation of renal
electrolyte homeostasis and innate immunity of the urin￾ary tract. The in-depth compositional analysis identified
62 serine hydrolases in normal urine independent of ac￾tivity state. The ABPP technique that we optimized in
urine is a powerful approach for functional proteomic
screening by profiling and identification of enzymes in
an active state.
Results
Demonstration of serine hydrolase activity in normal urine
Initial studies were undertaken to determine if there was
evidence of serine hydrolase activity in normal urine.
Urines were reacted with a fluorophosphonate probe tet￾ramethylrhodamine (FP-TAMRA) which detects a broad
range of serine hydrolase activities independent of the
specific reactions that these enzymes catalyze. Equal vol￾umes of random mid-stream urines from 18 healthy do￾nors were individually reacted with FP-TAMRA probe
under standardized optimal conditions. The proteins
were separated by SDS-PAGE and the fluorescently la￾beled active enzymes were visualized in gel (Figure 2).

Seven to ten distinct fluorescent bands of varying
intensity were observed in each sample with some
evidence of numerous weaker fluorescing species
(Figure 2). There were several common features in the
majority of the samples with bands in the 31 kDa and
75 kDa regions of all samples. Several weaker staining
bands in the 102–110 kDa and 40–50 kDa regions were
also observed in a subset of the samples. There did not
appear to be any gender-based differences in activity
patterns. The degree of FP-TAMRA staining demon￾strated frequent but not exclusive, correlation with total
protein composition as detected by Sypro Ruby, which
suggests that enzyme quantity is closely but not exclu￾sively correlated with enzyme activity. Finally, the
amount of FP-TAMRA labeled bands was significantly
less than the total protein composition as detected by
Sypro Ruby, suggesting that the enzymes detected by
the activity probe represent a minor component of the
total urinary protein pool (Figure 2).
The FP-TAMRA labeled proteins in normal urine were
affinity purified with an anti-TAMRA antibody [11] and ana￾lyzed by mass spectrometry as an approach to identifying the
specific active serine hydrolases in normal urine. The anti￾TAMRA purified material was highly enriched in labeled
proteins but markedly reduced in protein content relative to
the starting material (Figure 3). The gel regions containing
the FP-TAMRA labeled bands were cut and processed for
MS/MS. In a complementary approach, affinity-purified FP￾TAMRA labeled proteins were digested in-solution and iden￾tified by MS/MS. The affinity purification with anti-TAMRA
antibody was specific as demonstrated by the lack of enrich￾ment of TAMRA labeled proteins by an irrelevant antibody
to HIV gp120 (Additional file 1).
Thirteen active serine hydrolases were identified by
MS/MS following the in-gel or in-solution digestion.
The protein identifications were based on high confi￾dence scores ranging from a log10 (−3.2) to log10
(−128.6) using the Global Proteome Machine (http://
www.thegpm.org). A comparison of the predicted mo￾lecular weights of these proteins based on amino acid se￾quence and their molecular weights as estimated by
their positions on the SDS PAGE gels were consistent
with several of the labeled species observed in Figure 2.
This provided further support for the assigned identities
of the enzymes isolated by in-solution digestion.
The presence of serine hydrolase activity in normal
urines was directly assessed by incubating the urines (n = 18)
with one specific substrate and monitoring for the

generation of a reaction product. Evidence of carb￾oxyl ester lipase (bile salt-activated lipase) activity
was demonstrated using 4-nitrophenol palmitate as
substrate (Figure 4) [12]. The presence of kallikrein￾1 (tissue kallikrein) and urokinase activity was dem￾onstrated using the [D] Val-Leu-Arg-paranitronilide
substrate (Figure 4) [13]. Collectively, these results
confirmed the presence of several serine hydrolase
activities in normal urine.
Serine hydrolase composition of normal urine
Although the previous results identified the presence
of active urinary serine hydrolases it was apparent
that not all of the FP-TAMRA labeled species were
isolated by affinity purification (Figure 3). Therefore, a
2D LC-MS/MS analysis of pooled healthy urine sam￾ples (n = 4) was undertaken as an alternate approach
to determining the serine hydrolase composition of
normal urine. The goal was to characterize the overall

normal urinary serine hydrolase population; therefore
pooled urines were utilized for biological averaging in
lieu of individual biological replicates. A total of 1846
urinary proteins were identified and these lists were
annotated to identify all the potential serine hydro￾lases. A total of 62 serine hydrolases were identified
with high confidence GPM log10 (expectation) scores
of less than −3 (Table 1).
Twelve of the thirteen active serine hydrolases identi￾fied with ABPP affinity purification were present on the
2D LC-MS/MS compositional analysis (Table 2). Eleven
had high GPM log10 (expectation) scores, suggesting that
they are high abundance proteins. Notably, myeloblastin
(proteinase 3) appeared to be a low abundance protein
[log10 (−5.9)] and plasma kallikrein was only detected
with ABPP affinity purification, which supports the suc￾cessful isolation of low abundance active proteins. Finally,
several high abundance serine hydrolases (vitamin-K
dependent protein Z, tripeptidyl-peptidase 1, complement
factor I light chain) were not identified with ABPP affinity
purification. Taken together, these data suggest that the

active serine hydrolases identified were not due to non￾specific binding of high abundance enzymes.
Discussion
ABPP is a powerful new technique that provides an un￾biased, functional analysis of the proteome. Many gen￾omic, transcriptomic and proteomic approaches only
identify changes in protein quantity, which does not re￾flect protein functional status. ABPP offers additional in￾sights over metabolomics, since specific enzymes which
are differentially active can be identified for further
characterization. This study demonstrates the ease and
utility of ABPP with its potential applicability to different
renal disease models. This study also provides a unique
in-depth activity and compositional analysis of serine hy￾drolases in normal urine. Serine hydrolase activity fre￾quently, but not invariably, correlates with total protein,
thus emphasizing the need for functional proteomic
characterization. Interestingly, three active esterases were
identified that have limited functional characterization

and no previously specified role in the urine, and these
may be important targets for further analysis. Equally im￾portantly, we identified active serine proteases involved in
key renal physiological processes and innate immunity,
and these are discussed below.
Kallikrein-1 (tissue kallikrein) cleaves kininogen to pro￾duce vasoactive kinins and their activity is primarily medi￾ated through the bradykinin 1 (B1) and bradykinin (B2)
receptors [14]. The pleiotropic effects of kinins include
vasodilation, natriuresis, diuresis, anti-fibrotic and anti￾hypertrophic actions [15]. Bradykinin-dependent activa￾tion of the B2 receptor causes natriuresis by inhibiting
sodium reabsorption in the collecting duct [16]. However,
tissue kallikrein also acts in a kinin-independent manner
to regulate sodium reabsorption [16,17]. Tissue kallikrein
is a locally produced regulator that acts luminally on
ENaC receptors of the principal cells by cleaving its
γ-subunit, thus promoting increased sodium reabsorption
[16,17]. While it modulates sodium absorption, its actions
are not essential, as tissue kallikrein deficient mice main￾tain normal blood pressure and extracellular fluid volume
status.
Tissue kallikrein is also implicated in renal calcium
homeostasis [18]. Calcium is actively reabsorbed in the
distal convoluted tubule through the apical transient re￾ceptor potential channel vanilloid subtype 5 (TRPV5),
transported through the cytosol by calbindin-D28K, and
then basolaterally transported via the Na+
/Ca2+ exchan￾ger and Ca2+ ATPase transporters [19]. Luminal tissue
kallikrein stimulates calcium reabsorption by activating
the B2 receptor, which results in protein kinase C
(PKC)-dependent phosphorylation of TRPV5 [19]. This
causes stabilization and accumulation of TRPV5 at the
plasma membrane, thereby increasing net calcium re￾absorption [19]. Notably, regulation of the TRPV5 recep￾tor was specific to luminal, not basolateral, tissue
kallikrein [19].
Tissue kallikrein is also a unique aldosterone-independent
kalliuretic factor that allows for rapid adaptation to a diet￾ary potassium load in the cortical collecting duct [20]. Lu￾minal tissue kallikrein promotes potassium secretion by
stimulating ENaC activity and sodium reabsorption in the
principal cells, as described above [16,20]. Furthermore,
tissue kallikrein inhibits potassium reabsorption in inter￾calated cells by decreasing H+
/K+
-ATPase expression and
activity, resulting in a net kalliuretic effect [20]. Import￾antly, luminal tissue kallikrein demonstrated inhibition of
H+
/K+
-ATPase activity by 70%, whereas basolateral tissue
kallikrein had no effect [20].
In the kidney, tissue kallikrein is synthesized primarily
in the connecting tubule cells, and to a lesser extent in
the distal convoluted tubules and cortical collecting duct
[17]. Taken together, these data suggest that tissue kalli￾krein is synthesized proximally and released into the
pro-urine of the tubular lumen to act distally in a para￾crine fashion to regulate sodium, calcium and potassium
handling. Our observation that tissue kallikrein is present
in an active conformational state in normal human urine
expands on the mouse and in-vitro work done thus far,
and suggests that it may reflect real-time regulation of so￾dium, calcium and potassium handling. Shedding of active
tissue kallikrein in the urine may also represent a rapid
means to down-regulate its activity.
Kallikrein-related peptidase (KLK3), or prostate spe￾cific antigen, is located on the same gene locus as tissue
kallikrein (KLK1), however its function relates primarily
to the liquefaction of semen to allow sperm to move
freely, and has no known renal physiological functions.
Conversely plasma kallikrein (KLKB1) is located on a dif￾ferent gene locus but has very similar physiological func￾tions as tissue kallikrein [21]. Plasma kallikrein cleaves
high molecular weight kininogens to release vasoactive ki￾nins that activate the B2 receptor [21]. Plasma kallikrein
may potentially contribute to B2-receptor mediated natri￾uresis and calcium reabsorption, in a manner similar to
tissue kallikrein.
Urokinase-type plasminogen activator cleaves the zymo￾gen plasminogen into plasmin, a serine protease. Urinary
plasmin directly activates ENaC by cleaving its γ-subunit
to promote sodium reabsorption in nephrotic patients and
mice [22-24], in a mechanism similar to tissue kallikrein.
Svenningsen et al. postulated that a defective glomerular
filtration barrier allowed for passage of plasmin to activate
ENaC, thus contributing to hypertension and edema in
nephrotic syndrome [24]. However, the increased sensitiv￾ity of ABPP and mass spectrometry techniques utilized in
our study permitted the identification of both plasmin and
urokinase-type plasminogen activator in healthy individ￾uals. These novel data raise the possibility that urinary
plasmin plays a paracrine regulatory role via ENaC in nor￾mal renal physiology, not just nephrotic syndrome.
Urinary plasmin from nephrotic individuals also de￾creases calcium reabsorption by inhibiting the TRPV5 re￾ceptor [25]. Urinary plasmin catalyzes protease-activated
receptor-1, which promotes phosphorylation of TRPV5 at
a different site from tissue kallikrein, resulting in de￾creased channel pore size and calcium reabsorption [25].
Tudpor et al. did not identify plasmin in normal urine by
Western blot, but they demonstrated plasmin activity with
a plasmin-specific activity assay in normal urine [25],
which is consistent with our finding that plasmin is
present in an active conformational state in normal urine.
Interestingly, Tudpor et al. demonstrated that plasmin in￾hibits calcium influx with 50% inhibitory concentration
of ~3nM [25]. Taken together, this suggests that urinary
plasmin may play a physiological role at low concentra￾tions, which is readily detectable with mass spectrometry￾based techniques.

In a cardiac model, cathespin A localizes to atrial tis￾sue myocytes where it cleaves angiotensin I to release
angiotensin 1–9 [26,27]. Angiotensin 1–9 is a bio-active
peptide that enhances the kinin effect on the B2 receptor
and augments arachidonic acid and nitric oxide release
from endothelial cells [26,27]. Grobe et al. used MALDI￾TOF MS to evaluate bio-active peptides resulting from
renal processing of angiotensin II [28], but there is no
renal data regarding cathepsin A on angiotensin I. Our
observation that active cathepsin A is present in normal
urine suggests that it may play a physiological role, such
as potentiating the effect of renal-derived bradykinin.

have been shown to be involved in innate immunity.
Mannan-binding lectin serine protease 2 (MASP2) partici￾pates in activating the lectin pathway of the complement
cascade when MASP2 cleaves C4 [29,30]. Complement
C1r subcomponent-like protein (C1r-LP), homologous to
C1r, participates in activating the classical complement
pathway via cleavage of pro-C1s [31]. The role of C1r-LP
in complement-mediated functions is still unclear with
suggestions of both activating and inhibitory roles [31,32].
Proteinase 3 acts in concert with neutrophil elastase to
promote neutrophil activation by cleaving and inactivat￾ing the anti-inflammatory progranulin [33]. Furthermore,
proteinase 3 has been demonstrated to process human
cathelicidin-18 into the antimicrobial peptide LL-37 [34].
Taken together, these observations raise the intriguing
possibility that this group of enzymes may play an active
role in regulating the innate immunity of the urinary
tract.
There are some limitations to this study. First, this is
strictly an observational characterization of serine hy￾drolases in normal individuals. While there is literature
to support their activities in urine, these observations
are only hypothesis-generating since their physiological
role cannot be validated in the current model. Secondly,
the affinity-purification step was effective but did not
fully retrieve all the FP-TAMRA labelled proteins in the
sample. Given the ENaC regulators identified, we antici￾pated the identification of other ENaC regulators, such
as furin and prostasin [23]. Both furin and prostasin
were present on the 2D LC-MS/MS compositional ana￾lysis, but their active species were not identified with
ABPP. One possibility is that tissue kallikrein and plas￾min are physiologically dominant ENaC regulators, and
furin and prostasin play a limited role if any. However,
since all the bands were not enriched with affinity purifi￾cation we cannot categorically exclude their activity.
The strengths of this study relate to the novel ABPP
methodology which provides a functional proteomic
characterization that may be more physiologically rele￾vant than a straightforward compositional analysis. In￾deed, it provides insight into which enzymes may be
active versus filtered peptide fragments that are detect￾able with highly sensitive MS/MS approaches but may
have no function. ABPP allows for simultaneous assess￾ment of activity for most of an enzyme family and this of￾fers clear advantages for the discovery of novel species
with as yet undetermined substrate specificities. The ease
of visualization and comparison of labeled proteins in dif￾ferent samples offers the potential for rapid comparative
analysis of samples. These properties, linked with the po￾tential for affinity purification and MS-based identification
of labeled enzymes, markedly enhance the utility of the
approach. Critically, identification of specific enzyme ac￾tivity with ABPP offers the potential for developing rapid
colorimetric or fluorometric urine screening assays using
immobilized substrates (e.g. urine dipstick).
Conclusions
In conclusion, this is the first unbiased, functional
characterization of the urinary proteome using serine
hydrolase ABPP. ABPP identified normal urinary serine
hydrolases that are present in an active conformational
state. Urinary tissue kallikrein and plasmin were identi￾fied and may play a key role in sodium, potassium and
calcium homeostasis. Serine proteases involved in com￾plement activation and generation of antimicrobial pep￾tides were also identified which suggests a potential role
for regulation of innate immunity of the urinary tract.
Novel active esterases with undefined functions were
also identified that may be targets for further char￾acterization. Finally, ABPP methodology is a useful tool
that could be broadly applied to renal pathophysiological
states to identify differentially activated enzymes; de￾velop point-of-care monitoring assays; and potentially
identify new therapeutic targets, such as specific enzyme
inhibitors.
Methods
Activity-based protein profiling
Random, mid-stream urine samples were collected from
18 healthy individuals (male, n = 9 and female, n = 9).
Urines were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes at
4°C and the supernatant stored at −80°C for analysis.
Urine samples underwent a single freeze/thaw cycle
prior to ABPP analysis.
Serine hydrolase ABPP was optimized in normal
urines with FP-TAMRA (2 μM) [ActivX FP-TAMRA
serine hydrolase probe, Catalogue 88318, Thermo Fisher
Scientific USA] at different pH, temperature and reac￾tion times. FP-TAMRA probe incubation was performed
at pH 5, 7 and 9 and compared to labeled urines without
pH modification; pH 9 was subsequently determined to
be optimal (Additional file 2). FP-TAMRA probe incuba￾tion was also performed at 20°C, 37°C and 60°C (pH 9),
Navarrete et al. Clinical Proteomics 2013, 10:17 Page 8 of 11

and the weakest FP-TAMRA labeling for males and fe￾males was at 20°C (Additional file 3). Therefore, 37°C
was chosen as the optimal temperature for ABPP label￾ing as it is physiological, and we wanted to avoid heat
activation of enzymes. Lastly, reaction times were evalu￾ated at pH 9, 37°C for 5, 30 and 90 minutes (Additional
file 4) with 90 minutes shown to have optimal FP￾TAMRA labeling. Labeled proteins were separated on
LDS-PAGE [Rainbow Molecular weight marker RPN
800E, GE] and fluorescence from active enzymes was de￾tected on gel at a wavelength of 534 nm and 20 seconds
exposure time [Alpha Innotech – Fluorchem® Q, USA].
Gels were then incubated overnight with SYPRO Ruby ®
[Sypro Ruby gel stain, Catalogue S4942, Sigma Aldrich
USA] and washed with 7% acetic acid, 10% methanol solu￾tion for 20 minutes before scanning at a wavelength of
534 nm [Alpha Innotech – Fluorchem® Q, USA]. Urinary
serine hydrolase activity was found to be stable for up to 5
freeze thaw cycles.
Affinity purification & identification of active
serine hydrolases
Normal urine (50 mL) was concentrated to 800 μL using
centrifugation (4000 g, 30 minutes, 4°C) with a 30 kDa
cut-off [Amicon® UFC903024]. The concentrated sample
(200 μl) was labeled with 2 μM FP-TAMRA probe
[ActivX FP-TAMRA serine hydrolase probe, Catalogue
88318, Thermo Fisher Scientific USA] at pH 9, 37°C for
90 minutes. Samples were cleaned on Zeba columns
[Catalogue# 89891, Pierce] for 2 minutes, 1000 g, at 4°C.
Labeled enzymes were co-immunoprecipitated overnight
using 10 μl anti-TAMRA antibody [A6397, Invitrogen]
bound to 40 μl of Dynabeads® [Dynabeads® protein G,
Invitrogen], and then separated with a magnet. For in￾gel digestion, tagged proteins were separated on LDS￾PAGE, bands excised from gels and analyzed by MS-MS.
For in-solution digestion, the Dynabeads® were washed
(50 mM PBS, 0.25% Tween 20), and tagged proteins
digested with 250 ng trypsin [Promega V5111]. Peptide
digests were desalted and purified off-line using ZipTip®
C18 Pipette Tips [Millipore], were frozen at −80°C and
dried using a speed vacuum.
In-depth compositional analysis of normal urine – 2D
MS-MS
Urine protein (32 μg/individual) was pooled from four
healthy individuals for analysis. Samples (5 mL) were
filtered with a 0.22 μm PVDF syringe filter and then
concentrated to ~400 μl with a 3 kDa molecular weight
cut-off membrane (Amicon Ultra-15, Millipore) by cen￾trifugation (50 min, 4000 g, 4°C). The concentrated
urine was washed 3 times with 4.6 ml ammonium bicar￾bonate 100 mM. The final volume was adjusted to
500 μl with 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate. The sample
was reduced with 12.5 μl 100 mM DTT (30 min, 57°C)
and then alkylated with 12.5 μl 500 mM IAA (30 min,
room temperature). A final incubation with 20 μl DTT
100 mM was performed (30 min, room temperature) and
then trypsin digestion (1/50) was performed overnight
(37°C). After digestion, 50 μl of 10% TFA in acetonitrile
were added, the sample frozen at −80°C and dried in
speed vac. Samples underwent 2D LC/MS-MS for peptide
identification.
Nano RPLC-MS/MS
Samples were analyzed by nano-RPLC-MS/MS using an
A splitless Ultra 2D Plus [Eksigent, Dublin, CA] system
coupled to a high speed Triple TOF™ 5600 mass spec￾trometer [AB SCIEX, Concord, Canada]. Peptides were
injected via a PepMap100 trap column [0.3 × 5mm,
5 μm, 100 Å, Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA], and a 100 μm ×
150mm analytical column packed with 5 μm Luna C18
(2) was used prior to MS/MS analysis. Both eluents A
(water) and B (98% acetonitrile) contained 0.1% formic
acid as an ion-pairing modifier. The tryptic digest was
analyzed with 60 minutes gradient. Eluent B had a gradi￾ent from 0% to 35% over 48 minutes, 35% to 85% in
1 minute and was kept at 85% for 5 minutes at a flow
rate of 500 nL/min. Key parameter settings for the
TripleTOF 5600 mass spectrometer were as follows: ion￾spray voltage floating (ISVF) 3000 V, curtain gas (CUR)
25, interface heater temperature (IHT) 150, ion source
gas 1 (GS1) 25, declustering potential (DP) 80 V. All
data was acquired using information-dependent acquisi￾tion (IDA) mode with Analyst TF 1.5 software [AB
SCIEX, USA]. For IDA parameters, 0.25 s MS survey
scan in the mass range of 400–1250 were followed by 20
MS/MS scans of 100 ms in the mass range of 100–1600
(total cycle time: 2.3 s). Switching criteria were set to
ions greater than mass to charge ratio (m/z) 400 and
smaller than m/z 1250 with a charge state of 2–5 and an
abundance threshold of more than 150 counts. Former
target ions were excluded for 5 seconds. A sweeping col￾lision energy setting of 37 ± 15 eV was applied to all pre￾cursor ions for collision-induced dissociation.
Database analysis and protein identification
Spectra files were generated using Analyst® TF 1.5.1
Software and converted into mascot generic file format
(.mgf ) using AB SCIEX MS Data converter [AB SCIEX,
Foster City, CA]. These files containing the MS/MS
spectra information were submitted for protein identifi￾cation by the X!Tandem GPM (http://www.thegpm.org).
The following parameters were used: (i) enzyme, trypsin;
(ii) one missed cleavage allowed; (iii) fixed modification,
carbamidomethylation of cysteines (for in gel only); (iv)

variable modification, oxidation of methionine; (v) pep￾tide tolerance, 3.0 Da; and (vi) MS/MS tolerance, 0.4 Da.
The 2D LC-MS/MS data of normal urinary proteins
(n = 1846) were annotated against a list of serine hydro￾lases (n = 244) described by Cravatt et al. [8] and 4 other
serine hydrolases identified in Uniprot. Serine hydrolases
identified with high confidence GPM log10 (expectation)
scores of less than −3 (n = 62) derived from this annotated
list were used to generate Table 1.
