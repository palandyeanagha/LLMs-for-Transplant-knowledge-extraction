Abstract
Tissue fibrosis and chronic inflammation are common causes of progressive organ damage, including progressive renal
disease, leading to loss of physiological functions. Recently, it was shown that Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) is expressed in the
kidney and activated by endogenous danger signals. The expression and function of TLR2 during renal fibrosis and chronic
inflammation has however not yet been elucidated. Therefore, we studied TLR2 expression in human and murine
progressive renal diseases and explored its role by inducing obstructive nephropathy in TLR22/2 or TLR2+/+ mice. We found
that TLR2 is markedly upregulated on tubular and tubulointerstitial cells in patients with chronic renal injury. In mice with
obstructive nephropathy, renal injury was associated with a marked upregulation and change in distribution of TLR2 and
upregulation of murine TLR2 danger ligands Gp96, biglycan, and HMGB1. Notably, TLR2 enhanced inflammation as reflected
by a significantly reduced influx of neutrophils and production of chemokines and TGF-b in kidneys of TLR22/2 mice
compared with TLR2+/+ animals. Although, the obstructed kidneys of TLR22/2 mice had less interstitial myofibroblasts in the
later phase of obstructive nephropathy, tubular injury and renal matrix accumulation was similar in both mouse strains.
Together, these data demonstrate that TLR2 can initiate renal inflammation during progressive renal injury and that the
absence of TLR2 does not affect the development of chronic renal injury and fibrosis.

Introduction
Tissue fibrosis is a hallmark of a variety of chronically failing
organs, including progressive renal disease, and is a leading cause of
morbidity and mortality worldwide [1]. A growing body of evidence
suggest that almost 45% of all deaths in the developed world can be
ascribed to some type of chronic fibrotic disease such as interstitial
pulmonary fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, and progressive renal disease [1].
In the kidney, the degree of inflammation and fibrosis of the
tubulointerstitial compartment are strong predictive factors for the
loss of renal function and the risk for progression to end-stage renal
disease [2]. Renal fibrosis is defined by the accumulation of interstitial
leukocytes and myofibroblasts that contribute to abnormal accumu￾lation of extracellular matrix (ECM) and eventual tubular atrophy
and loss of renal function [3–5]. Irrespective of the nature of the
primary disease and the originating renal compartment, renal fibrosis
is considered to be the common final pathway by which kidney
diseases with variable etiology progresses to end-stage renal failure. It
is therefore important to identify factors that participate in the
initiation of tubulointerstitial inflammation and subsequent interstitial
fibrosis during progressive renal injury. From our own and other
data, it has become clear that Toll-like receptor (TLR)2 and 4 plays a
crucial role in the induction of acute inflammation and early tubular
injury in the kidney in a reversible model of acute renal injury [6–8].
TLR2 belongs to the TLR family of conserved pattern
recognition receptors that are expressed on leukocytes, (myo)fi￾broblasts [9,10], and renal cells [11,12] and can detect motifs of
pathogens and subsequently induce innate and adaptive immuni￾ty. Most interestingly, TLRs, including TLR2, also recognize
endogenous danger molecules that have been altered from their
native state or accumulate in non-physiologic sites or amounts
during cellular injury [13–22]. In this context, TLRs may be
crucial cellular sentinels to detect ‘‘danger’’ signals released during
tissue damage [23] and important initiators of inflammation and
fibrosis. The expression and localization of TLRs has however not
been analyzed previously during fibrinogenesis, and nothing is
known about their role in renal progressive disease and fibrosis. A
potential role for TLRs in the physiopathological pathway of
fibrosis is suggested by a recent observation showing that TLR4
enhances myofibroblast activation and fibrinogenesis in the liver
[24]. Together, these data led to the hypothesis that TLR2 plays a
key role in monitoring renal injury and in mediating inflammation
and fibrosis in progressive renal disease. To test this hypothesis we
studied the expression of TLR2 in human and murine chronic
renal diseases and explored its role by inducing renal fibrosis in
TLR22/2 or TLR2+/+ mice using the murine model of unilateral
ureteral obstruction (UUO), a well accepted experimental model
for the study of the mechanisms of progressive renal fibrosis.

Results
TLR2 is upregulated in kidneys from patients with
tubulo-interstitial damage
Fibrosis and renal atrophy are common outcomes of hydrone￾phrosis due to obstruction. Therefore, we wondered if tubulo￾interstitial damage that developed upon obstructive hydronephrosis
may be associated with TLR2 expression. Immunohistochemical
staining for TLR2 with an Ab that was proven to be highly specific
for both murine and human TLR2 [6,25] revealed a strong increase
of TLR2 expression in every one of the four analyzed hydrone￾phrotic obstructed kidneys of patients (Fig 1B) compared to control
biopsies without tubular changes and with few TLR2 positive
interstitial cells (Fig. 1A). Extensive renal atrophy in end-stage
hydronephrotic kidneys made it however impossible to phenotype
TLR2-positive cells on histologic sections. Therefore, we analyzed
TLR2 expression during chronic IgA nephropathy which is also
associated with interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and interstitial
inflammation. Similar to patients with hydronephrosis we found a
strong increase of TLR2 expression in all the fifteen analyzed
kidneys of IgA nephropathy patients (Fig. 1C and D) compared to
control renal biopsy specimens (Fig. 1A). TLR2 was mainly
expressed by tubulointerstitial cells and some expression was found
at the apical side of renal tubules (asterisks Fig. 1D). Double staining
revealed that various interstitial myofibroblasts (blue) (asterisks
Fig. 1E) and in particular macrophages (blue) (asterisks Fig. 1F)
expressed TLR2 (red). Occasionally, we found granulocytes in renal
biopsies with low expression of TLR2 (data not shown).
TLR2 and its endogenous stress ligands are markedly
upregulated in kidneys during UUO in mice
To evaluate the influence of fibrinogenesis at different stages on
the expression and localization of TLR2 we next measured the
amount of mRNA and protein in UUO-injured kidney of TLR2+/+
mice at several time points. This revealed that the amount of TLR2
mRNA was almost 5 times increased 3 days after UUO and
continued to increase at later time points (Fig. 2A). The expression
pattern of TLR2 protein followed a similar trend as compared to
TLR2 mRNA expression. TLR2 protein was markedly upregulated
3, 7 and 14 after UUO-injury in kidneys of TLR2+/+ mice as
compared with the contralateral unobstructed kidneys (Fig. 2B).
High magnification images (inserts) show that 3 and 7 days after the
induction of injury TLR2 was predominantly located at the apical
side of renal tubules. After 14 days, apical TLR2 staining seems to
be lost and in stead extended into the cytoplasm and interstitium.
Control sections (t = 14), omitting primary antibody showed no
overt staining (data not shown). Analysis of the expression of known
endogenous stress ligands that potentially could activate TLR2, e.g.
Gp96, biglycan, HMGB1, HSP60 and HSP70 [16,19,26–28]
during progressive renal injury revealed a strong upregulation of
the amount of biglycan (t = 7, 14), HMGB1 (t = 14), and Gp96
(t = 14) mRNA after UUO injury compared to contralateral kidneys
(Fig. 3A). In line, we found a profound upregulation of
tubulointerstitial Gp96, tubular biglycan and HMGB1 protein 14
days after the induction of UUO injury (Figure 3B). No
upregulation was seen in HSP70 and HSP60 mRNA levels after
UUO-injury (data not shown). Together, these data suggest that
progressive renal injury leads to a marked enhancement of TLR2
and several main endogenous stress ligands.
No effect of TLR2 deficiency on UUO-induced tubular
injury and ECM accumulation
To assess the functional contribution of TLR2 to the develop￾ment of tubular injury and interstitial fibrosis in UUO, we next
scored for histological signs of renal injury and analyzed the
expression of the major ECM component collagen. This revealed
that tubular injury increased markedly after UUO as reflected by
the presence of dilated tubules, loss of brush border, and epithelial
simplification in the tubulointerstitium (data not shown). However,
semi-quantitative scoring of these renal sections revealed no
differences in renal injury between both groups of animals (Fig 4).
Fibrosis increased progressively from day 3 till 14 as reflected by a
marked upregulation of collagen in obstructed kidneys of both
animal strains compared to the contralateral kidney (Fig. 4).
However, no differences in collagen accumulation could be found
between both mouse strains as assessed by picrosirius red staining
and collagen type I and III immunostaining (Fig 4).
Reduced renal inflammation in TLR22/2 mice
One of the early events in progressive renal injury is the
recruitment of inflammatory cells. Analysis of the influx of granulo￾cytes and macrophages demonstrated that the amount of inflamma￾tory cells increased progressively from day 3 till 14 in obstructed
kidneys compared to the contralateral unobstructed kidney (Fig. 5B).
The increased leukocyte influx in the tubulointerstitium was accom￾panied by a strong increase in renal KC (granulocyte attractant), and
MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant) (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, granu￾locyte influx was 3, 2.5 and 4.5 times lower in the obstructed kidney of
TLR22/2 animals compared with TLR2+/+ mice respectively 3, 7,
and 14 days after UUO injury (Fig. 5A,B) as assessed by
immunohistochemistry (Fig. 5A, t = 14). In line, we found that the
levels of KC (t = 3, t = 7) was significantly lower in the obstructed
kidney of TLR22/2 animals compared with TLR2+/+ mice (Fig. 5C).
Although no significant differences were found when analyzing
macrophage influx (Fig. 5B) we did find lower levels of MCP-1 (t = 7)
in TLR22/2 mice compared to TLR2+/+ animals. Together, these
results reveal an important role for TLR2 in the induction of a pro￾inflammatory immune response during progressive renal injury.
Reduced amounts of myofibroblasts in TLR22/2 mice
To further explore the role of TLR2 during obstructive
nephropathy, we additionally analyzed the amount of myofibro￾blasts (a-SMA). This showed that the amount of myofibroblasts was
significantly increased 3 days post-UUO and continued to increase
at later time points. Interestingly, significantly less myofibroblasts
accumulated in the renal peritubular interstitium of TLR22/2 mice
compared with TLR2+/+ animals 14 days after UUO-injury (Fig. 6).
Reduced activation of Matrix Metalloproteinases in
TLR22/2 mice
We next investigated the main pathway that is involved in ECM
degradation: the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) degrading
pathway. This demonstrated that progressive renal injury increased
mRNA expression of MMP2 and MMP9 and their respective
inhibitors TIMP2 (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases) and
TIMP1 (Fig. 7A). Interestingly, both MMPs and TIMPs were
significantly reduced in TLR22/2 mice compared to TLR2+/+
mice 14 days after UUO-injury (Fig. 7A). The decrease in mRNA of
MMP2 and MMP9 was accompanied with a lower MMP9 activity
in kidneys TLR22/2 mice as assessed by zymography at this time
point (Fig. 7B, no difference after 7 days, data not shown). No
difference between TLR22/2 and TLR2+/+ mice was observed for
MMP-2 activity both 7 and 14 days post-UUO.
TLR22/2 mice have lower levels of apoptosis in UUO￾induced fibrosis
Tubulointerstitial injury in UUO-injury can result in an
imbalance between tubular epithelial cell (TEC) apoptosis and
TLR2 and Chronic Renal Injury

proliferation. We found that apoptosis occurred predominantly in
the renal cortex and increased significantly after 3 days of
obstruction. A marked decrease in the number of apoptotic TECs
was present in obstructed kidneys of TLR22/2 mice compared to
TLR2+/+ kidneys at day 7 (Fig. 8A). As it is difficult, if not
impossible, to identify apoptotic TECs after 14 days when tubular
atrophy was very severe we analyzed at this time point the total
amount of apoptotic cells and found a similar trend as seen after 7
days. Tubular proliferation of cortical tubules became prominent
on day 3 post-UUO (Fig. 8B). However, no differences were found
between TLR22/2 and TLR2+/+ at 3 and 7 days after
obstruction. Fourteen days after obstruction, TLR22/2 mice

of IgA nephropathy (C, D) or in control renal biopsy specimens (A). TLR2 was clearly upregulated in kidneys of patients with obstructive
hydronephrosis or IgA nephropathy and mainly expressed by tubulointerstitial cells. Some expression was found at the apical side of renal tubules
(asterisks, D). Double staining showed coexpression of various myofibroblasts (blue) (asterisks E), and numerous macrophages (blue) with TLR2 (red)
(asterisks F). No immunoreactivity of TLR2 was observed in negative control sections derived from IgA nephropathy patients (insert A, primary
antibody omitted).

showed significantly less proliferation of cells than TLR2+/+
animals.
Reduced Renal TGFb activity
TGFb is one of the most important molecules in the
pathogenesis of renal fibrogenesis [29]. To determine whether
the reduction in renal fibrosis and apoptosis in TLR22/2 mice
was associated with an alteration in TGFb, we finally examined
TGFb protein. This revealed that the amount of total TGFb as
well as activated TGFb was significantly lower in kidneys from
TLR22/2 mice compared to TLR2+/+ mice 7 days after UUO￾induced injury (Fig. 9). A trend towards less (active) TGFb was
furthermore seen 14 days after UUO-induced injury (not
significant). As HGF antagonizes the fibrogenic effects of TGFb,

(inserts) show that 3 and 7 days after UUO TLR2 was mainly located at the apical side of renal tubules in both cortex and medulla. After 14 days, apical
tubular TLR2 staining in cortex and medulla is lost and extended into the cytoplasm and the interstitium.

we also analyzed the renal level of this growth factor and found no
significant differences between TLR2+/+ and TLR22/2 mice at all
time points (data not shown).
Discussion
Renal fibrosis is the final common pathway for numerous
kidney diseases regardless of the initiating pathology that can cause
progressive renal failure. Therefore, knowledge of the regulatory
mechanisms involved in monitoring a primary renal insult, and in
mediating renal fibrosis and infammation is essential for the
development of therapeutic strategies for the prevention or
treatment of progressive kidney diseases. Although we have
previously shown that TLR2 plays a critical role in the initiation
of acute renal inflammation and early tubular injury in a reversible
model of acute renal ischemic injury [6], nothing was known about
its role in chronic inflammation and fibrosis during progressive
renal injury. Our results demonstrate that TLR2 and its main
stress ligands are markedly upregulated in the kidney after UUO￾injury, obstructive hydronephrosis (TLR2) and IgA nephropathy
(TLR2) and identify TLR2 as an initiator of renal inflammation
(neutrophil influx, cytokine induction) during progressive renal
injury. TLR2 does not play an essential role in the development of
renal fibrosis or the progression of renal disease after UUO-injury.
In this study we characterized the expression pattern of TLR2
in kidneys from patients with obstructive hydronephrosis, severe
IgA nephropathy as well as from mice subjected to obstructive
nephropathy. We found a clear increase in TLR2 protein
expression in patients with progressive renal injury as well as an
increase in TLR2 mRNA and protein through a time course of
UUO with a prominent change in the distribution pattern. During
early phases of UUO TLR2 was mainly located at the apical site of
tubules while it was lost and in stead extended throughout the
tubular cytoplasm and the interstitium at later time points when
fibrosis was more severe. In agreement, we found that patients
with severe IgA nephropathy had a predominant interstitial TLR2
expression with occasionally apical staining of tubuli. The apical
expression of TLR2 on tubular cells could be optimal for
interaction with filtered or leaked stress ligands [30–32] or with
ligands that are expressed apically [33]. Indeed, we found a
profound upregulation of tubular biglycan with expression at the
apical side and in the cytoplasm during UUO injury. Moreover,

there are data demonstrating that HMGB1 can be secreted from
cells and can leak into the urine [34] making it possible to interact
with apical TLR2. Although cytoplasmic HMGB1 was only faintly
found, it could as well interact with cytoplasmic TLR2. Finally,
tubulointerstitial cell-associated Gp96 might interact with TLR2-
positive tubulointerstitial cells at the later phases of UUO. One has
to keep in mind that these ligands could potentially activate TLR4
as well. The intracellular localization of TLR2 is consistent with
data demonstrating that upon stimulation by specific ligands,
TLR2 receptor clusters are targeted to the Golgi apparatus [35].
Loss of apical TLR2 staining in tubuli in later phases of UUO or
during severe forms of IgA nephropathy could reflect loss of apical
brush border due to tubular damage. Of particular interest was the
observation that several renal myofibroblasts coexpressed TLR2.
In line, others have found that intestinal myofibroblasts and
synovial fibroblasts of patients with rheumatoid arthritis express
TLR2 [9,10]. TLR2 positive interstitial cells in IgA nephropathy
patients and mice subjected to UUO therefore most likely reflect
the influx of leukocytes known to express TLRs and the
accumulation of myofibroblasts. Indeed, we found numerous
TLR2-positive macrophages in patients with IgA nephropathy.
Although Wolfs et al. found constitutive TLR2 mRNA expression
in murine tubular epithelial cells of normal kidney [12], we could
only detect TLR2 protein in tubular cells when the kidney was
damaged. This might indicate that the antibody we used is not
sensitive enough to detect very low levels of protein or that some
sort of regulation of the TLR2 expression is being applied at the
post-transcriptional, translational or proteosomal level.
With the use of TLR22/2 mice, we additionally demonstrated
that TLR2 did not play an essential role in the development of
progressive renal injury and fibrosis during obstructive nephropa￾thy. It is generally believed that fibrosis of several organs, including
the kidney, is a consequence of the disturbance of the balance
between ECM synthesis by myofibroblasts and ECM degradation
by matrix metalloproteinases as well as by excessive and persistent
inflammation. Although we found significantly less myofibroblasts
in TLR22/2 mice compared to Wt animals 14 days post-UUO, the
accumulation of ECM components was not different between both
mouse strains. The latter is in agreement with findings of Seki et al.
which show that TLR2 is not required for hepatic fibrogenesis after
bile duct ligation [24]. The decrease in myofibroblasts can be
explained by the reduction in fibroblasts activation. Fibroblasts
become activated into myofibroblasts by stimuli such as the
infiltration of inflammatory cells and TGF-b1 [36]. Indeed, we
found that both the amount of granulocytes as well as the amount of
TGF-b1 was significantly decreased in mice deficient for TLR2
compared to Wt animals. In line with the similar degree of fibrosis
and injury, no differences were found in the amount of infiltrated
macrophages in TLR2+/+ and TLR22/2 mice.
Next, we investigated analyzed the MMP degrading pathway.
Surprisingly, MMP2/TIMP2 and MMP9/TIMP1 mRNA expres￾sion and MMP9 activity was considerably reduced in TLR22/2
mice compared to Wt animals. This is in line with findings
demonstrating that MMP9 is selectively induced through TLR2 in
human and murine monocytic cells stimulated with bacterial TLR
ligands [37,38]. The diminished MMP activity in TLR22/2 mice
Figure 4. Analysis of UUO-induced tubular injury and fibrosis. Tubular injury was semi-quantitatively scored using PAS-D stained renal tissue
sections. Tubular damage was similar between TLR2+/+ (%) and TLR22/2 (&) mice at all time points. Fibrosis was quantitatively scored by measuring
renal collagen accumulation in TLR2+/+ and TLR22/2 mice 3, 7, and 14 days after UUO or in contralateral kidneys. This revealed that fibrosis was
comparable in kidney of TLR22/2 mice compared with TLR2+/+ animals during UUO-induced injury. The percentage of positive staining for collagen
(picrosirius red staining), collagen type I and III was analyzed in both cortex and medulla using a computer-assisted digital analysis program. Data are
mean and SEM of six mice per group, *p,0.05.

would explain why there is no difference in ECM accumulation in
these animals despite the reduction of matrix-producing myofibro￾blasts and TGF-b. Indeed, it is generally assumed that diminished
MMP activity is responsible for ECM deposition.
In addition, we investigated the role of TLR2 in inflammation
during obstructive nephropathy. The observations that renal
TECs, macrophages and myofibroblasts express TLR2 [9–
12,39](this study) and that the main TLR2 danger ligands are
upregulated during progressive renal injury (this study) suggest that
these cells are capable of monitoring cellular damage and inducing
an inflammatory response. Indeed, we found that TLR22/2 mice
had reduced chemokine levels and neutrophil influx in their
kidneys compared to Wt animals during obstructive nephropathy.
Although the presence and kinetics of neutrophils are not well
documented during UUO and neutrophils are not a major player
in this model, Duymelinck et al. as well demonstrate the presence
of PMNs in UUO-kidneys [40]. The significance of this finding is
however not clear and further studies will be necessary to elucidate
the exact role of neutrophils in this model. We and others have
shown that TLR2 and TLR4 is needed for chemokine production
of murine TECs that are exposed to simulated ischemia in vitro
and that renal-associated TLR is an important initiator of
inflammatory responses in ischemic acute renal failure in vivo
[6–8]. In addition, others have shown that murine TECs,

animals after UUO as counted in 10 randomly selected high-power fields (A, t = 14). No differences were found in the amount of macrophages.
Leukocytes were counted in cortex and medulla of renal tissue sections stained for Ly-6G (A: t = 14, B) and F4/80 (B). TLR22/2 mice have furthermore
significantly reduced KC (t = 3, 7, 14), and MCP-1 (t = 7) levels in their kidneys as compared to kidneys from TLR2+/+ mice (C). The presence of protein
was measured in kidney homogenates by specific ELISA. Data are mean and SEM of six mice per group. *p,0.05.

macrophages and human (myo)fibroblasts produce chemokines via
TLRs when exposed to bacterial components [9,11,41] or
endogenous danger ligands [42]. A further explanation for the
decrease in cytokines and TGF-b in mice lacking TLR2 could be
that there is a reduction in TLR2-dependent macrophage and
(myo)fibroblast activation. This would agree with our observations
that various renal myofibroblasts and in particular macrophages
express TLR2. Indeed, TLR ligands provide a major activating
signal to macrophages [42] and (myo)fibroblasts [9,41,43] via
TLRs which on their turn can produce cytokines among which
TGF-b. In line with this thought is a recent paper demonstrating
that TLR4 induce myofibroblast activation, TGF-b signaling,
chemokine production and fibrinogenesis in the liver after bile
duct ligation [24]. Obviously, further experimental work is
necessary to determine whether these TLR-dependent processes
also apply to primary macrophages and (myo)fibroblasts in the
kidney during renal progressive injury. Together, these data
suggests that the activation of TLR2 on tubular epithelial and
interstitial cells by endogenous stress ligands may play a role in
renal inflammation, and apoptosis during progressive renal injury.
Indeed, mice deficient for TLR2 had less tubular apoptosis as well
as an impaired inflammatory response compared to wild type
mice. These data underline the current concept proposing that
TLRs play a central role in the pathogenesis of a number of kidney
disease [44,45].
Of particular interest is the finding that TLR22/2 mice had less
TEC apoptosis 7 days after UUO-injury while the amount of
proliferation was equal as compared to TLR2+/+ mice. This could
be explained by the reduction in TGF-b and the decrease in the
amount of neutrophils we found in these animals. Indeed, both
neutrophils and TGF-b are involved in the induction of tubular
cell apoptosis in UUO [46]. The lower amount of TGF-b in
TLR22/2 mice could reflect the reduced TLR2-dependent
synthesis of this factor by TECs, macrophages, and interstitial
fibroblasts. The reduction in tubular apoptosis in TLR22/2 mice
can also be explained by studies demonstrating a proapoptotic
function of TLR2 [47,48]. In line, we already found that tubular
apoptosis was markedly lower in kidneys from TLR22/2 mice
than that in kidneys from TLR2+/+ mice after renal ischemic
injury [6]. We also observed significantly less regeneration of
TECs in TLR22/2 mice as compared to TLR2+/+ animals after
14 days of UUO. This could reflect the reduced tubular apoptosis
in these animals or could imply that TLR2 is necessary for tissue
repair [49].
This study presents the first description of the expression,
localization and role of TLR2 in renal progressive injury which is
characterized by inflammation, apoptosis and fibrosis. We found
that TLR2 initiates a renal inflammatory response during
obstructive nephropathy but does not play a significant role in
the development of renal progressive injury and fibrosis. These
results shed new light on the way tissue can monitor chronic
cellular injury and subsequently can initiate an inflammatory
response.

Patients
Four human hydronephrotic obstructed kidneys with extensive
fibrosis and tubulus atrophy were removed from patients with end￾stage renal disease at the Academic Medical Center. Fifteen renal
biopsies of a retrospective study of stored samples were obtained
from patients undergoing diagnostic evaluation before therapy was
started. The diagnosis IgA nephropathy was based on light
microscopic (HE, periodic acid-Schiff, methenamine silver, and
alcian blue), and immunofluorescence (IgA, IgG, IgM, C3, C1Q,
and light chains) analyses. Patients with coexisting diseases were
excluded. We graded renal biopsy specimens according to the
classifications of Haas [50] and analyzed biopsies for TLR2 of
patients with severe IgA nephropathy (class IV and V). Clinical
and biochemical parameters are described before [51]. Five
patients with non-IgA nephropathy were included as controls,
among which patients with minimal change nephropathy, and thin
basement membrane disease that had no pathologic change by
light microscopy. All renal biopsies were taken for diagnostic
purposes only. This research project used left-over biological
material, anonymised and delinked from patient records, and as
such was not subject to any requirement for ethical review or
approval.
Mice
Pathogen-free 9- to 12-wk-old male C57BL/6 Wt (TLR2+/+

backcrossed to C57BL/6 background six times, generated as
described previously [52], and bred in the animal facility of the
Academic Medical Center. Age- and sex-matched mice were used.
Unilateral Ureter Obstruction
Renal progressive injury was induced as described previously
[53,54]. Briefly, the right ureter was ligated under general
anesthesia (0.07 ml/10 g mouse of FFM mixture, containing:
1.25 mg/ml midazolam (Roche), 0.08 mg/ml fentanyl citrate, and
2.5 mg/ml fluanisone (Janssen Pharmaceutica). The abdomen was
closed, and mice received a subcutaneous injection of 50 mg/kg
buprenorphin (Temgesic, Shering-Plough) for analgetic purposes.
Contralateral nonobstructed kidneys served as control. Mice (n = 6
per group) were sacrificed 3, 7, and 14 days after surgery.
RNA purification and RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from renal tissue sections (n = 6 per
group) with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and converted to cDNA.
TLR2, heat-shock protein (HSP)60, HSP70, Gp96, biglycan, high
mobility group box chromosomal protein(HMGB)1, MMP2,
MMP9, TIMP1, and TIMP2 were analyzed by RT-PCR with
SYBR green PCR master mix. Specific gene expression was
normalized to mouse hypoxanthine-guanine-phosphoribosyltrans￾ferase (HPRT) gene expression. SYBR green dye intensity was
analyzed with linear regression analysis. Primer sequences are as
follows: HPRT forward primer 59-tcctcctcagaccgctttt and reverse

TLR2 expression
Five mm frozen tissue sections were prepared, fixed in ice-cold
aceton and endogenous peroxidase activity and non-specific
binding were blocked with 0.3% H2O2 containing sodium azide
and 5% normal goat serum (Dako). Sections were stained for

from TLR2+/+ (%) and TLR22/2 (&) mice 3, 7, and 14 days after
UUO or in contralateral kidneys. The number of apoptotic (t = 7)
tubular cells and proliferating (t = 14) cells were significantly lower in
kidneys from TLR22/2 mice compared to kidneys from TLR2+/+ animals
as counted in 10 randomly selected high-power fields. Cells were
counted on renal tissue sections stained for active caspase-3 (apoptosis)
and Ki67 (proliferation). Due to severe tubular atrophy, it is impossible
to identify apoptotic TECs after 14 days. Therefore we analyzed at this
time point the total amount of apoptotic cells (both interstitial cells and
tubular cells). Data are mean and SEM of six mice per group, *p,0.05.

TLR2 (anti-mouse/human TLR2, T2.5, eBioscience), incubated
with powervision block (human sections, Immunologic), power￾vision poly-HRP-GAM/R/R IgG (human sections, Immunologic)
or goat anti mouse IgG1 HRP (murine sections, Southern
Biotech). The TLR2 Ab was proven to be highly specific for both
murine and human TLR2 and did not bind to murine TLR22/2
macrophages [25] nor to TLR22/2 granulocytes and monocytes
or renal cells of TLR2-antisense-treated mice [6]. Staining without
applying a first antibody served as negative control. Slides were
developed using DAB (human sections, Sigma) or AEC (murine
sections, Sigma). The slides were counterstained with methyl green
(human sections, Sigma) or hematoxylin (murine sections).
Double staining
Frozen sections of human renal biopsies were treated according
to the prescribed method for TLR2 histochemistry. Subsequently
the specimens were incubated with a cocktail of IgG1K anti￾TLR2 mAb (T2.5, eBioscience), anti-a-SMA (1A4, msIgG2a,
Dako), anti-CD68 (EBM11, Dako) which we labeled with DIG,
and anti-CD15 (MMA, NeoMarkers), and incubated with goata
mouse IgG1-HRP (Southern Biotech) or goat a mouse IgG1-AP
(Southern Biotech) for TLR2, goat a mouse IgG2a-AP for a-Sma
(Southern Biotech), sheep a DIG-AP (Roche) for CD68, or goat a
mouse IgM-HRP (Southern Biotech) for CD15 in PBS and 5%
normal human serum. Slides were developed using Vector Blue
alkaline phosphatase substrate kit III (Vector Laboratories) along
with Levamisole (Dako) and Vector NovaRed sustrate kit for
peroxidase (Vector Laboratories). For optimal evaluation of
double staining, we used spectral imaging and image analysis
software (Nuance spectral imaging system, CRi; Woburn) to
improve perceptibility of each individual color in immune double
stains.
Gp96, biglycan and HMGB1 expression
Tissue sections of kidneys were deparaffinized and boiled for
10 min in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0). Non-specific
binding and endogenous peroxidase activity were blocked with
0.3% H2O2 in 100% methanol and 10% normal goat serum
(Dako). Sections were then exposed to rat-anti GRP94 (Gp96,
Abcam), goat-anti biglycan (Abcam) and rabbit-anti HMGB1
(Abcam), followed by a further incubation with rabbit-anti rat
biotine (for GRP94, Dako), swine-anti goat HRP (for biglycan,
Biosource), and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat￾anti rabbit IgG (for HMGB1, Immunovision Technology). Gp96
sections were subsequently incubated with avidin-biotin complex
(ABComplex/HRP, DAKO, UK). Slides were finally developed
using 1% H2O2 and DAB (Sigma) in 0.05 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.9).
The slides were counterstained with methyl green (Sigma).
Staining without applying a first antibody served as negative
control.
Histopathological scoring
All histopathological scorings were made in the cortex using
PAS-D-stained renal tissue sections and performed by a pathol￾ogist on coded slides. The percentage of damaged tubules in the
cortex was estimated using a four-point scale according to the
following criteria: tubular dilatation, epithelial simplification, and
interstitial expansions in ten randomly chosen, non-overlapping
fields (6400 magnification). Lesions were graded on a scale from 0
to 4: 0 = normal; 1 = mild, involvement of less than 25% of the
cortex; 2 = moderate, involvement of 25% to 50% of the cortex;
3 = severe, involvement of 50 to 75% of the cortex; 4 = extensive
damage involving more than 75% of the cortex.
Detection of collagen, granulocytes, macrophages, and
myofibroblasts
Renal tissues were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in
paraffin. Four mm sections were deparaffinized, and digested with
a solution of 0.25% pepsine (Sigma) in 0.01 M HCl for
granulocyte and collagen type III detection, or boiled for 10 min
in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for collagen type I,
macrophage, and myofibroblast detection. Subsequently, endog￾enous peroxidase activity and non-specific binding were blocked as
described and sections were respectively exposed to FITC-labeled
anti-mouse Ly-6G mAb (Pharmingen), rabbit polyclonal to
collagen type I (GeneTex), rabbit polyclonal to collagen type III
(Biologo), rat anti-mouse F4/80 IgG2b mAb (Serotec), or mouse￾a-human-aSMA-IgG2a (DAKO). For staining of granulocytes,
slides were incubated with rabbit anti-FITC antibody (Dako) and
peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Immunovision
Technology). For staining of collagen type I and III slides were
incubated with peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG
(Immunovision Technology). For macrophage staining, slides were
incubated with rabbit anti-rat biotin (Dako), followed by
streptavidin-ABC solution (Dako). For staining of myofibroblasts,
slides were incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG2a-HRP (Southern
Biotech). The slides were developed using 1% H2O2 and DAB in
0.05 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), and counterstained with methyl green.
The number of Ly-6G-positive cells were counted in 10 non￾overlapping fields (6400). The severity of interstitial fibrosis was
additionally evaluated histologically using light microscopy on
paraffin-embedded sections stained with picrosirius red that
identifies interstitial collagen fibers. The percentage of positive
staining for collagen, a-SMA, and F4/80 was analyzed using a
computer-assisted digital analysis program (Image Pro-plusH,
Mediacybernetyics). At least 15 visual fields were sampled from
the cortex and medulla of each kidney using a 206objective.
Evaluation of Metalloproteinase (MMP) Activity by Gel
Zymography
Frozen tissue sections were sonicated in RIPA buffer (Sigma).
Equal quantities of protein (10 mg) were loaded onto a 10%
sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel containing
2 mg/ml gelatin (Bloom 225, Sigma) next to a protein marker.
To induce MMP activity, gels were incubated overnight at 37uC in
a buffer containing 50 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mM NaCl,
5 mM CaCl2 and 0.02% Brij-35 (Sigma). To visualize MMP
activity, gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, destained
and subsequently photographed.
Preparation of renal tissue for cytokine measurements
For cytokine measurements, snap frozen kidneys were diluted in
lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 15 mM Tris, 1 mM MgCl2 pH 7.4,
1 mM CaCl2, 1% Triton, 100 mg/ml pepstatin A, leupeptin and
aprotinin), homogenized and incubated at 4uC for 30 min.
Homogenates were subsequently centrifuged at 1500 g at 4uC
for 15 min, and supernatants were stored at 270uC until assays
were performed.
ELISA
Cytokines and chemokines were measured in kidney homoge￾nates using specific ELISAs (R&D Systems) according to the
manufacturers’ instructions. Activation of latent TGFb is done
according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Renal
HGF was measured by ELISA using a mouse anti-HGF antibody
(R&D ystems) and a goat anti-HGF (R&D systems) following
standard procedures. The detection limits were 12 pg/ml for KC,
TLR2 and Chronic Renal Injury
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 11 May 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 5 | e5704

7 pg/ml for MCP-1, 125 pg/ml HGF, and 16 pg/ml TGF-b.
Cytokine levels were corrected for the amount of protein present
using the BioRad protein assay (BioRad Laboratories) with IgG as
standard.
Detection of apoptosis and proliferation
To evaluate the degree of tubular proliferation and apoptosis,
tubular Ki67 and active caspase-3 indices were, respectively,
determined by counting numbers of positive tubular cells in at least
10 randomly chosen nonoverlapping fields (400 high-power field
(hpf)).Tissue sections of kidneys were deparaffinized and boiled for
10 min in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0). Non-specific
binding and endogenous peroxidase activity were blocked as
described, followed by an incubation with rabbit anti-human
active caspase 3 polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling), rabbit-anti￾Ki67 antibody (DAKO) followed by incubation with peroxidase
(HRP)-conjugated goat-anti rabbit IgG (Immunovision Technol￾ogy), and processed as described above. Slides were finally
developed using 1% H2O2 and DAB (Sigma) in 0.05 M Tris￾HCl (pH 7.9) and counterstained with methyl green (Sigma).
Statistical analysis
Differences between groups were analyzed using Mann￾Whitney U test. Values are expressed as mean6standard error
of the mean (SEM). A value of p,0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
