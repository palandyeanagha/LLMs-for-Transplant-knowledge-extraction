Abstract
Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD; MIM ID’s 173900, 601313, 613095) leads to end-stage kidney
disease, caused by mutations in PKD1 or PKD2. Inactivation of Pkd1 before or after P13 in mice results in distinct early- or
late-onset disease. Using a mouse model of ADPKD carrying floxed Pkd1 alleles and an inducible Cre recombinase, we
intensively analyzed the relationship between renal maturation and cyst formation by applying transcriptomics and
metabolomics to follow disease progression in a large number of animals induced before P10. Weighted gene co-expression
network analysis suggests that Pkd1-cystogenesis does not cause developmental arrest and occurs in the context of gene
networks similar to those that regulate/maintain normal kidney morphology/function. Knowledge-based Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis (IPA) software identifies HNF4a as a likely network node. These results are further supported by a meta-analysis of
1,114 published gene expression arrays in Pkd1 wild-type tissues. These analyses also predict that metabolic pathways are
key elements in postnatal kidney maturation and early steps of cyst formation. Consistent with these findings, urinary
metabolomic studies show that Pkd1 cystic mutants have a distinct profile of excreted metabolites, with pathway analysis
suggesting altered activity in several metabolic pathways. To evaluate their role in disease, metabolic networks were
perturbed by inactivating Hnf4a and Pkd1. The Pkd1/Hnf4a double mutants have significantly more cystic kidneys, thus
indicating that metabolic pathways could play a role in Pkd1-cystogenesis.

Introduction
Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD;
MIM ID’s 173900, 601313, 613095) is the most common genetic
cause of polycystic kidney disease (PKD), with an estimated
prevalence of approximately 1:1000 [1]. ADPKD is caused by
mutations in PKD1 (,85%) or PKD2 (,15%), which encode
polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2), respectively. Morpho￾logically, the disease is characterized by the gradual replacement
of normal kidney parenchyma by fluid-filled cysts [2]. Though 15
years have elapsed since the identification of PKD1 and PKD2 and
despite intense effort focused on determining the function of their
respective gene products, the pathways and mechanisms by which
PC1 and PC2 regulate luminal diameter remain poorly under￾stood.
To better model the disease in rodents and determine how
acquired Pkd1 inactivation results in cyst formation, we had
developed a novel mouse line with floxed alleles of Pkd1 that could
be conditionally inactivated in a large proportion of kidney cells at
distinct timepoints [3,4]. We used this line to determine that Pkd1
inactivation prior to P12 results in cyst formation within 7–21
days, whereas inactivation on or after P14 results in cyst formation
only after 4–5 months [4]. This effect is associated with changes in
gene expression patterns that take place between P12 and P14 in
wild-type kidneys. Other groups have similarly identified devel￾opmental windows in which inactivation of Pkd1 [5] or other
cystogenes (Kif3a and Tg737 [6], HNF-1b [7]) leads to early- or
late-onset cyst development. These observations suggest that
pathways related to kidney maturation play relevant roles in rapid
cyst formation.
The existence of a functional maturation phase in postnatal
kidney was postulated over 50 years ago, when physiologists
observed that the composition and volume of urine excreted by
newborn animals, when compared to adults, tended to vary less in
response to osmotic stress [8]. Subsequent studies linked some of
these changes to intrinsic renal postnatal events, such as changes in
expression patterns of tight junction proteins or transporters
[9,10]. However, the pathways responsible for postnatal kidney
maturation and how they relate to the maintenance and
establishment of kidney architecture remain unknown. The

current study tackles this issue by analyzing mRNA, microRNA
and urinary metabolomics during the early stages of cyst formation
and kidney maturation in control and mutant animals induced
before P10. To our knowledge, this is the first study to focus on this
short time interval and characterize the interplay between these
two phenomena. Our results suggest that there is no developmen￾tal arrest in PKD kidneys, but that metabolic and HNF4a-related
pathways involved in kidney maturation are modifiers of
cystogenesis. This finding was confirmed by showing that double
knockout of Hnf4a and Pkd1 significantly worsens cystic disease.
Results
Metabolic Pathways Could Underlie Kidney Maturation
and Determine the Susceptibility to Rapid Cyst
Formation in the Early-Onset Model of ADPKD
A total of 70 kidneys [36 Pkd1cko/cko;tamoxifen-cre positive
(mutant) and 34 Pkd1cko/cko;tamoxifen-cre negative (control)] in
which Pkd1 knockout was induced between P5 and P9 were
harvested between P11 and P24 and analyzed using gene
expression arrays. This set includes mutant kidneys with variable
degrees of cystic transformation. In fact, animals induced at P7
display mostly normal histology at P12 (6 normal and 11 with
dilated tubes) and are cystic at P14 (4 dilated and 14 grossly cystic;
Figure 1A). Consistent with our previous data showing high rates
of Pkd1 inactivation in this model [4], mutant kidneys are enlarged
and globally cystic at later time points.
A subset of 32 P12 and P14 mutant and control samples was
used for bioinformatics analysis (test group), and the results were
validated using the remaining samples (validation group). Principal
component analysis (PCA) plots show that clustering correlates
with genotype and age in the test group (Figure 1B). Statistical
analysis shows that few genes (48 probes; fold change.1.2 and fdr￾adjusted p,0.05) are different between mutants and controls at
P12, but that over 600 genes (622 probes; fold change.1.2 and
fdr-adjusted p,0.05) are differentially expressed at P14. To enrich
for genes differentially expressed at the early stages of cyst
formation, we focused on the subset that had some evidence of
differential expression at P12 (i.e. either fold change.1.2 or fdr￾adjusted p,0.05) and that fulfilled both criteria at P14 (i.e. fold
change.1.2 and fdr-adjusted p,0.05). This yields a mutant￾signature of 87 genes (Table S1). Most of these genes are up￾regulated in mutants, with higher expression levels in cystic (P14)
animals (Figure 1C). The mutant-signature also clusters mutant
and control mice in the validation group (Figure 1D). Gene
ontology (GO) classification suggests that the mutant-signature is
significantly enriched in categories related to cell differentiation
(3.64E-05), tissue remodeling (5.75E-05), and a variety of
developmental and metabolic processes (E-04 and E-03) (Table
S2).
One surprising result was the small number of genes with
changes greater than 50%. Despite this finding, the expression
patterns in mutant and control groups are sufficiently different to
cluster most samples according to genotype, suggesting many
small, but genotype-specific, differences. Weighted gene co￾expression network analysis (WGCNA) is an approach particularly
well suited for such situations. WGCNA can be used to identify
clusters of genes with similar patterns of expression across a set of
microarray samples rather than individual, differentially expressed
genes [11]. The approach provides various features that can be
used to cluster closely related patterns into a small number of
distinct modules, each of which can be summarized by its first
principal component (module eigengene), which can then be
associated with genotype, developmental state or phenotypic traits.
The greatly reduced number of variables also simplifies the
analyses by minimizing the multiple testing problem. Using
WGCNA, one can create a connectivity matrix that models gene
networks with hubs, a condition likely met by biological networks
[12].
We therefore used WGCNA to analyze our dataset. Calculating
the correlation between module eigengenes and genotypes, we
identified one significantly correlated cluster (ME2, 629 genes,
correlation: 0.81, p = 2.5E-08; Table S3). Of the 629 genes in
ME2, 67 are part of the mutant-signature described above (overlap
p = 6.0E-20). Furthermore, this cluster distinguishes mutant and
control groups also in the validation set of samples (Figure 1E).
The ME2 cluster also was enriched for multiple GO categories
related to development (E-08), cell differentiation, anatomical
structure morphogenesis (E-07), and metabolic pathways E-04;
Table S4). Additional pathway analysis using the knowledge-based
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software suggested that several
genes in both ME2 and the mutant signature gene sets not only
belong to metabolic functional groups but are also connected to/
via HNF4a, a transcription factor involved in the regulation of
several metabolic and developmental pathways [13] (Figure 2A).
Interestingly, other nodes previously implicated in PKD, such as
Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) [14], angiotensinogen (AGT) [15]
and arginine vasopressin (AVP) [16] were also identified in this
network.
Gene Correlation Networks Are Preserved in Mutant
Animals
To further analyze the link between kidney maturation and
early stages of cyst formation, consensus gene modules (i.e. clusters
of genes that are highly connected in each of the four experimental
groups: (P12/P14) x (mutant/control)) were identified using
WGCNA. Correlations between module eigengenes were then
calculated for each experimental group [17]. The analysis of the
preservation of the correlation between module eigengenes across
different biological conditions has been proposed as a measure of
similarity between gene networks [18], and in theory allows one to
determine if changes in gene expression patterns are due to
changes in gene networks, or to changes in the levels of expression
within conserved gene networks.
Author Summary
Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is
the most common genetic cause of polycystic kidney
disease and is responsible for 4.6% of the end-stage renal
disease (ESRD) cases in the United States. It is most often
caused by mutation in the PKD1 gene. To understand this
disease, we made a mouse model in which we could
delete the Pkd1 gene and study the animal as its kidney
becomes cystic. Using this model, we had previously found
that the maturation status of the animal determines
whether cysts form within days or within months, and
we had narrowed down this switch to a two-day interval.
In the current study, we used the rapid cyst-forming model
to analyze the expression pattern of thousands of genes in
mutant and control kidneys, and metabolites excreted in
the urine. Our results identify a number of genes that may
be involved in cyst formation and suggest that metabolic
changes may play a role in ADPKD and could alter disease
progression. These analyses also predict that metabolic
pathways are key elements in normal postnatal kidney
maturation.

Our data yield a high degree of preservation between the
various gene modules across all conditions (preservation values:
0.88 to 0.92), suggesting no major network changes. In addition,
using a dendrogram to depict eigengene correlations, sets of highly
correlated eigengenes (i.e. meta-modules) can be readily visualized
(Figure 2B) and are mostly preserved between mutant and
controls. However, the turquoise module (Table S5), which is
highly correlated with the pink/blue/yellow/red modules at P12,
is less correlated at P14, both in mutants and controls (Figure 2B).
These data suggest the surprising result that the major change in
how the gene networks are inter-related in our model is not due to
Pkd1 inactivation, but rather due to changes that occur normally
between P12 and P14. They also imply that the transcriptional
networks activated during normal kidney maturation are also
deployed in the mutant kidney, which, our data suggest, mature
normally. These data are also consistent with the PCA plot in
Figure 1B, which separated P12 and P14 animals.
Given the striking difference in the susceptibility to the effects of
Pkd1 inactivation before or after P13, it is therefore likely that the
biological processes modulated by genes in the turquoise module
are important modifiers of PKD. Gene ontology classification
suggests that MEturquoise is almost exclusively enriched for
metabolic pathways (top hit, generation of energy, p-2.57E-21;
Table S6). Taken together with the enrichment of metabolic
pathways in disease-specific gene sets (ME2 and mutant signature),
our data are consistent with a role of the metabolic contexts in
determining the switch from early- to late-onset cystic disease in
this Pkd1 model. These findings suggest the unintuitive result that
metabolic, rather than developmental, pathways are responsible
for the dramatic change in susceptibility to Pkd1 inactivation in
P12 vs. P14 mice.
No Evidence of MicroRNA Changes in Pkd1 Mutant
Kidneys
MicroRNA’s are thought to play an important role in fine￾tuning gene expression and have been reported relevant for kidney
development [19] and PKD [20,21]. Therefore, it seemed
reasonable to suppose they could be involved in orchestrating
the observed gene expression changes. We analyzed 47 samples
using Agilent microRNA arrays spanning the P12/P14 mutant
and control groups (Table S7) and failed to identify differences (fdr
p value,0.05). No differences were found by real-time quantita￾tive PCR in a set of 3 microRNA’s previously linked to cystic
disease (mir15a, mir21 and mir31 [20,22]; Figure 3).
Meta-Analysis of Published Gene Array Data of Pkd1
Wild-Type Tissues Identifies Gene Modules Likely
Involved in Kidney Maturation and Cyst Formation
If, as our data suggest, the gene expression changes in Pkd1
mutants are not due to major re-wiring of gene networks, it seems
reasonable to suppose that modules of genes normally co-regulated
in distinct biological conditions (such as different organs,
developmental stages, or activation status of signaling pathways)
might also be co-regulated in Pkd1 mutants. As a consequence,
such modules, when enriched for genes differentially expressed in
Pkd1 mutants, could uncover pathways likely disrupted in mutant
animals. To test this, 1114 microarray experiments surveying
various biological conditions were downloaded from the Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/)
repository, and analyzed using WGCNA (Table S8). Of the 49
gene modules thus obtained (Table S9), two had significant
overlap with the mutant signature set (Modules 5 and 17,
p,0.001, Table S10). Alternatively, ranking these modules
according to how accurately they predict (mutant x age) status
in the test dataset, module 17 had the lowest misclassification rate,
clustering only one of the mutants with the controls (and none of
the controls with mutants; Figure 4). Consistent with the results
described in the previous sections, gene ontology analysis showed
enrichment for metabolic pathways (Module 5, p = 1.82E-97;
Table S11), cell adhesion and organ morphogenesis (Module 17,
p = 1.59E-32 and 3.26E-11; Table S12). Furthermore, enrichment
for HNF4a-pathways (nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group H,
member 4; p = 3.3E-05) was again observed. Analogous analysis
searching for modules with enrichment for genes that change with
the normal P12 to P14 transition identifies modules 5 and 17 as
the most significant gene clusters (Table S10), further suggesting
that similar transcriptional programs are involved in both early
stages of cyst formation and postnatal maturation.
HNF4a Is a Modifier of Pkd1-Cystogenesis
The independent identification of HNF4a as a relevant
transcription node using various strategies suggested that it could
play a role in Pkd1-cystogenesis. In fact, work in our lab had
previously shown increased HNF4a activity in Pkd1 null placentas
and kidneys [23]. To further probe the role of metabolic pathways
in general, and HNF4a in particular, in Pkd1-cystogenesis, Pkd1cko
mice were bred to Hnf4acko mice. Gene knockout was induced at
P7, and the animals were harvested between P12 and P21.
Analyzing kidney/body weight and cystic index between P19 and
P21 in a set of 46 cre positive Pkd1cko/cko animals (8 Hnf4acko/cko; 23
Hnf4acko/wt; 15 Hnf4awt/wt), our results suggest that the presence of
HNF4a has a significant protective effect on cyst formation
(Figure 5). Despite the variability in phenotype, the 95%
confidence interval suggests a reduction of between 5 and 63%
in the kidney/body weight (p = 0.023), and between 10 and 67%
in cystic index (p = 0.013), an effect similar to that reported with
the use of metformin, a metabolism-altering drug [24].
Urinary Metabolomics Shows Altered Metabolic Profile in
Mutant Animals
Metabolic changes in the urine of 84 animals, ranging from P12
to P21, were assessed using ultraperformance liquid chromatog￾raphy followed by quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry
(UPLC/QTOFMS). Principal component analysis suggests that
Pkd1cko/cko cystic mutants have a distinct profile of excreted
metabolites, irrespective of Hnf4a genotype (Figure 6A). A set of
1458 mass spectra (528 electrospray ionization (ESI) positive,
Table S13; 930 ESI negative, Table S14; mean.0.1 in both
mutant and control groups, fdr-p,0.02, fold change.2) were
differentially detected between control and mutants, 84 of which
could be mapped to KEGG ids recognized by IPA (54 of which
were unique identifiers in KEGG pathways; Table S15), and were
used for further pathway analysis. The results suggest altered
activity in several metabolic pathways (Table 1 and Table S16),
including purine and tyrosine metabolism. Tyrosine metabolites

are known to cause kidney injury, and at least one mouse model of
hepatorenal tyrosinemia shows evidence of altered cAMP signaling
[25], a pathway thought to be involved in PKD [16,26,27].
Using partial least squares, urinary acetylcarnitine was identified
as the metabolite that most accurately predicts mutant status, with
levels higher in mutants at all time points (Figure 6B). Verification
of acetylcarnitine was obtained by comparing fragmentation
patterns of urine samples with authentic standard by tandem
mass spectrometry (Figure 6C). Increased concentrations of l￾carnitine and acylcarnitines have been described in patients with
disorders of organic acid metabolism [28], pathologies that also
manifest polycystic kidneys [29]. Taken together, these results are
consistent with the observed changes in metabolic pathways
playing a role in modulating cystogenesis.
Discussion
A handful of studies have previously examined gene expression
changes in human and mouse renal cystic tissue. While they have
reported interesting differences that affect multiple signaling
pathways, they have a number of important limitations that
greatly reduce their informativeness. In the case of human
ADPKD, two studies have described global gene expression
changes in Pkd1-related cyst formation using cells derived from
non-cystic/cystic human kidneys [30,31]. In one, the investigators
performed SAGE analysis of four immortalized cell lines derived
from normal and cystic biliary epithelial cells (N = 1 each) and
normal and cystic renal epithelial cells (N = 1 each). Top
differentially expressed genes (N = 250) were selected for a custom
array that was then used to query gene expression in eight cystic
kidneys removed from individuals with end stage kidney disease
and six undefined ‘‘normal’’ kidneys. Only ,50% of the genes had
detectable signal above background in this set of specimens, and
differential expression was detected for 74. The SAGE and chip
patterns were discordant for 12 of the 74 genes.
The second study compared gene expression levels in a total of
13 cysts (grouped into three sizes) from five cystic kidneys along
with a ‘‘minimally’’ cystic renal cortical specimen from each
specimen to gene expression levels in three non-cancerous
‘‘normal control’’ specimens excised from the renal cortex of
three nephrectomized kidneys with isolated renal cell carcinoma.
The study did not provide any details about the cell-type
composition of the cyst (ie. isolated cyst-lining epithelial cells vs.
excised cysts which include both epithelial and non-epithelial cell
components).
There are a number of other important considerations relevant
for both studies: 1) the number of individuals that was studied was
small; 2) experimentally relevant details were not provided for the
control groups; 3) when using cystic vs. ‘‘control’’ cell lines
extracted from ADPKD patients, defining relevant control lines is
a major challenge as cysts arise from various nephron segments; 4)
differences may be idiosyncratic to individuals or clones and hard
interactions). B) Dendrograms of module eigengenes showing blocks of correlated eigengenes (meta-modules: in rectangles) suggest that gene
correlation networks are preserved in mutant animals but change during P12 to P14 kidney maturation. The metabolism-related MEturquoise cluster
(arrow; genes in Table S5) is part of meta-module at P12 but not at P14.

to generalize; 5) cysts from end-stage kidneys may have gene
expression patterns that are secondary to the cystic stage or uremic
state and not necessarily part of Pkd1-related pathways.
There also have been two studies of Pkd1 mutant mouse models.
Chen et al. used a hypomorphic model to track changes in gene
expression over the course of the first 3.5 weeks of life (four time
points, N = 13 pairs) as the kidney progresses from a globally
microcystic to a macrocystic stage [32] and Pandey et al. focused
on embryonic kidneys, analyzing Pkd1 null and control kidneys at
E14.5 and E17.5 (N = 3 at each time point) [21]. Both studies have
methodologic issues that complicate their interpretation. In the
case of the Chen study, analysis of the raw data suggests the
presence of one outlier (GSM339412) and at least one sample
likely with hybridization artifacts (GSM339408; background
higher than signal in one channel, and undetected in the other),
and it is unclear how/if they affect the reported results. In the case
of Pandey et al, most of the analyses were performed using an
uncorrected p-value. When we repeated the analyses using their
dataset (GSE24532) and corrected for multiple comparisons, very
few probes were significantly differentially expressed (File S1). In
fact, some of the genes reported as differentially expressed between
mutant and control E14.5 animals seemed to have expression
values below background, and high detection p-values, suggesting
that their fluctuations could be experimental noise, rather than

true biological differences. When we re-analyzed the data keeping
only probes with detection p-value,0.01 in all samples, the
number of differentially expressed genes between mutants and
controls at E14.5 or E17.5 was dramatically reduced, and Gene
Set Enrichment Analysis failed to run due to the small number of
differentially expressed genes.
Our study has a number of unique features that distinguish it
from the others. First, we targeted a poorly understood postnatal
renal maturation stage that we had previously shown plays a
critical role in determining the rate of cyst formation in response to
acquired Pkd1 inactivation. Second, we compared gene expression
patterns from both pre-cystic and early cystic specimens and
correlated them to transcriptional programs activated during this
late stage of kidney maturation. Third, we used a large number of
homogeneous samples, thereby minimizing both biological and
experimental noise. Importantly, using rigorous correction for
multiple comparisons, we identified a modest number of small, but
significant, gene expression changes. Finally, we confirmed our
findings in a second, large validation set of specimens that covered
a wider temporal window. The profile generated using the test
group properly clustered the validation set of specimens.
One important goal of our study was to try to identify
transcriptional networks responsible for the cystic state. Using
WGCNA to examine co-expression networks, we were surprised to
find similar architecture in both mutant and controls. We then
extended the study to include meta-analysis of 1114 gene
expression arrays that sampled a variety of tissues and biological
conditions and obtained similar results. In fact, they suggest that
some modules of co-regulated genes are preserved across distinct
biological conditions, including Pkd1 inactivation, and that
transcriptional regulation of a few of these modules is responsible
for a large fraction of the gene expression changes observed in
Figure 5. Hnf4a is a modifier of Pkd1-cystogenesis. (A) Representative kidney histology of Pkd1cko/cko; Hnf4acko/cko; Tamoxifen-Cre+ (left) and

Pkd1 mutants. They also provide proof of principle that one can
mine databases for clusters of co-regulated genes overlapping with
small sets of disease-signature genes to uncover relevant pathways.
Finally, these results lead us to speculate that PKD pathogenesis
might share some characteristics with biological processes such as
ageing, in which the compounding of small changes, rather than
few, major differences, determines the phenotype. However, as the
mechanisms linking these changes to PC1 remain unknown, it is
theoretically possible that a major hub downstream of PC is
responsible for all subsequent changes.
Complementing the WGCNA approach, we used knowledge￾based network tools to identify from the set of mutant signature
genes candidate biological networks with altered activity. One of
the advantages of a network-based approach to studying disease is
that it identifies key molecules at nodes that may play important
roles in modulating disease initiation and progression. Interest￾ingly, we found that a number of the nodes had previously been
linked to polycystic kidney disease (TNF, AGT, AVP). For
example, TNF-awas reported to trigger cyst formation in both
wild-type and Pkd2+/2 kidney organ cultures [14], suggesting a
role for inflammatory pathways in cyst growth. The renin￾angiotensin system (AGT) has been reported to accelerate disease
progression by enhancing fibrosis and promoting cyst growth [15].
The AVP/vasopressin receptor signaling pathway is thought to
promote cystic disease by increasing cAMP levels, which then are
thought to promote fluid secretion via PKA-dependent chloride￾channels and cystic epithelial cell growth via activation of B-Raf/
ERK pathway [27]. Two clinical trials are currently underway
testing the hypothesis that drugs which modulate the AGT and
AVP nodes will slow progression of disease (ClinicalTrials.gov:
HALT PKD NCT00283686; TEMPO 3/4 NCT00428948).
In the current study, we focused on HNF4a because we had
multiple lines of evidence implicating the protein in Pkd1
cystogenesis. As noted elsewhere, we had previously reported
altered HNF4a activity in Pkd1 null placentas and kidneys [23].
Our present data are consistent with those observations, showing
significant enrichment for genes linked to metabolic pathways in
our mutant signature set and in disease-associated eigengenes. Our
metabolomics data further support this connection. HNF4a also
was identified by IPA as one of the most highly connected nodes
with the most direct links. Therefore, we perturbed the network
map by inactivating Hnf4a in the context of Pkd1 inactivation and
found that HNF4a in fact plays an important modulatory role in
the early onset Pkd1 cyst model. Given that our studies
independently identified three nodes previously implicated as
important pathway factors in PKD and predicted a fourth that we
confirmed with genetic manipulation of the gene, we postulate that
some of the other nodes may also be important disease modifiers
(ie. nitric oxide synthase 1 (NOS1), superoxide dismutase 2
(SOD2), SHC-transforming protein (SHC1)). It is perhaps relevant
that both SOD2 and SHC1 have a role in regulating mitochon￾drial activity and response to oxidative stress. Further study will be
required to test this hypothesis.
HNF4a is a transcription factor with complex, possibly inter￾related functions in the regulation of developmental programs,
maintenance of organ differentiation and regulation of metabolic
pathways. In the developing embryo and fetus, it plays a critical
role in epithelial morphogenesis. Homozygous germline inactiva￾tion results in early embryonic demise [33]. Bypassing this lethal
stage by tetraploid rescue or conditional inactivation strategies,
investigators have shown that Hnf4a also is essential for liver and
colon development [34–37]. In post-developmental organs,
inactivation of Hnf4a has more subtle, functional effects [38,39].
Post-partum inactivation of Hnf4a in the liver results in fatty livers
and altered serum levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and bile acids
whereas inactivation in the colon results in an intact organ with
increased susceptibility to injury. Possibly linked to both its
developmental and post-developmental roles is HNF4a’s key
function as a regulator of several metabolic pathways [40,41]. It
may act as a nutritional sensor [36,40–42] with its function
regulated mainly by posttranslational modifications and binding to
co-regulators [42]. The possible inter-dependence of the different
roles for HNF4a are in part suggested by studies that show that
some of the pathologic consequences resulting from its inactivation
appear to be non-cell autonomous. Whereas Hnf4a null hepato￾cytes in vivo lack normal polarity and epithelialization, cultured
Hnf4a null cells polarize properly and are indistinguishable from
control cells, suggesting that polarity defects might be secondary to
abnormal expression of metabolic genes [43].
The role of HNF4a in the kidney is incompletely defined. It is
expressed widely in the developing organ and is thought to help
regulate mesenchymal to epithelial conversion (MEC) during
nephrogenesis [44]. In the adult, Hnf4a is expressed mostly in the
cortex, and in proximal tubules, with very low levels of expression
in collecting ducts [45]. While no comprehensive analysis of post￾natal inactivation of Hnf4a has been reported, in our pilot studies
of Pkd1 wild type mice we saw no obvious histologic effects of
Hnf4a inactivation in the kidney during the timeframe used in this
study (unpublished observation). In contrast, we found that
inactivation of Hnf4a in the context of simultaneous Pkd1

inactivation significantly worsened the cystic phenotype. There￾fore, we speculate that the paucity of cortical cysts in the early
stages of cyst formation, and the increased severity of cystic disease
in double Hnf4a/Pkd1 knockout might reflect a protective role of
HNF4a. In this scenario, HNF4a activity could be compensatory
to Pkd1 inactivation. Alternatively, HNF4acould be a marker (or
driver) of broader metabolic changes, possibly even in other organs
(liver), and it is possible that the relevant modifier is the metabolic
context, rather than one specific metabolic regulator. According to
this model, HNF4a-related changes in metabolic and/or other
signaling pathways could change the way cells respond to signals,
conferring context-dependent differences in the susceptibility to
the effects of Pkd1 inactivation. However, it has to be noted that
animals induced after P14 do eventually get cystic (late-onset
model), suggesting that changing metabolic contexts may retard,
but is unlikely to prevent, disease progression. It also remains to be
shown if the same networks/pathways are involved in early- and
late-onset Pkd1 disease models.
Urinary metabolomic studies provide additional evidence
indicating that dysregulated metabolic pathways may be a
property common to multiple forms of PKD. In the current
study, we found metabolites of four metabolic pathways signifi￾cantly different in the urine of early and moderately cystic Pkd1
mutant mice (Table 1). Taylor et al analyzed the urine of female
control and minimally cystic jck mice, a mouse model for human
nephronophthisis that has a mutation in the murine orthologue of
human NPHP9, and found seven metabolic pathways that differed
significantly between genotypes [46]. Abbiss et al compared the
urine of control and moderately cystic Lewis autosomal recessive
polycystic kidney disease rats and found altered levels of 2-
ketoglutaric acid, allantoin, uric acid and hippuric acid [47].
Together, these data suggest that metabolic pathways may play
an important role in PKD pathobiology. The link between
metabolic changes and cell behavior is well recognized in cancer
cells, where glycolysis in the presence of oxygen (Warburg effect)
and activation of synthesis of substrates for cellular components
have long been noticed [48]. In the case of PKD, interpretation of
the metabolic differences is more complicated. In late stages of the
disease, modest differences in proliferation rate and uremic status
may be a confounding factor. However, the transcriptional
changes and some of the metabolic differences are observed in
minimally cystic animals when proliferation rates are either
normal or minimally different. Moreover, the urine samples of
moderately cystic mutants in our dataset do not cluster by PCA
with those of younger normal mice who have a much higher
proliferation rate. In sum, it is unlikely that changes in
proliferation rates alone can explain the differences in metabolism.
These changes in metabolism may be upstream (or downstream) of
several pathways, such as the AMP/ATP-sensing AMP-kinase, or
aminoacid-activated mTOR signaling, previously linked to PKD
[49]. Our results suggest an alternative explanation for metabolic
changes, based on differences in HNF4a activity.
An important question prompted by these observations is
whether the observed metabolic effects are the result of the cystic
state or a causal factor in promoting cyst growth. We think the
data suggest that both answers are true. As noted above, the cysts
form contemporaneous with the changes in gene expression, and
the altered cellular properties associated with the cystic state likely
result in altered cellular metabolism. In this respect, the altered
metabolic profile and gene expression patterns may be a
consequence of cystic transformation. However, we also show
that manipulating Hnf4a activity, and thereby presumably altering
the regulation of metabolic gene expression, also modifies the
phenotype. This observation suggests that metabolic pathways
may be a disease modifier. Future studies will be necessary to
determine whether it is the altered activity of metabolic pathways
per se or some other functional consequence of Hnf4a activity that
is responsible for our findings. It also will be important to
determine the most proximal, direct, link between Pkd1 deletion
and changes in metabolic pathways.
We have previously shown that proliferation rates drop
normally in mutant kidneys induced at P12, and suggested that,
assuming proliferation can be used as a marker of developmental
status, it was unlikely that Pkd1 deletion induced developmental
arrest [4]. Here we show that changes in gene co-expression
networks correlate with kidney maturation between P12 and P14
in control animals. Furthermore, we observe very similar network
changes in mutant animals during the same interval. WGCNA
analysis seems therefore sensitive enough to detect changes in
developmental status, and the results imply that mutant kidneys
are neither developmentally arrested, nor de-differentiated. It is
however likely, given our GO results, that genes normally involved
in developmental processes are differentially expressed in mutant
kidneys.
Several groups have previously implicated microRNAs in PKD
pathogenesis. Using both a comprehensive screening method
(microarray) on a large number of specimens and targeted real￾time quantitative PCR of a small number of PKD-associated
microRNAs on a subset of specimens, we failed to identify
significant differences in microRNA expression during the early
stages of cyst formation. Several factors could account for these
discrepancies: 1) method sensitivity; 2) differentially expressed
microRNA’s could be cell/model/disease stage-specific; 3) asyn￾chronous waves of microRNA changes may occur in different
nephron segments. It is interesting to note, however, that
conditional knockout of Dicer in proximal tubules, a nephron
segment that becomes cystic when Pkd1 is inactivated, does not
result in cystic disease in mice up to 6 months of age, despite
microRNA depletion [50] (Dr. Dong, personal communication).
Genes in both the mutant-signature and ME2 module are
significantly enriched in gene ontology categories involved in
development, which likely reflect the remodeling of nephron
segments (anatomical structure development, p = 3.42E-09; cell
adhesion, p = 7.87E-09) and surrounding vasculature (vasculature
development, p = 1.13E-05). This suggests that additional signif￾icant categories such as cell differentiation (p = 9.31E-08) could be
related to morphological changes, rather than due to develop￾mental arrest/dedifferentiation, consistent with our results of
normal kidney maturation and preservation of gene correlation
networks in mutants. Enrichment for metabolic pathways, though
also seen in the ME2 cluster (heterocycle metabolic process,
p = 3.13E-06; regulation of steroid metabolic process, p = 3.32E￾03), is particularly noticeable in the turquoise module, which
includes oxidation/reduction (p = 1.16E-14), protein metabolic
process (p = 9.12E-09) and glucose metabolism (1.58E-08). As this
module seems to be correlated with kidney maturation and
possibly to the susceptibility to the effects of Pkd1 deletion, our data
highlight the metabolic context as a likely modifier of cystogenesis,
a hypothesis further supported by the observed genetic interaction
with Hnf4a. It would be interesting to see if perturbing the
metabolic context could turn the early-onset into a late-onset
model in animals induced before P12. It also remains to be shown
that metabolic changes play a role in the late onset form of the
disease.
In conclusion, the present comprehensive systems biology
approach provided important insights into PKD biology and
kidney maturation. The data suggest that Pkd1-cystogenesis does
not require/cause developmental arrest, and occurs in the context
Transcriptomics and Metabolomics of ADPKD

of gene networks essentially similar to those that regulate/maintain
normal kidney morphology/function. We also propose that
postnatal kidney maturation is accompanied by changes in
metabolic pathways that are likely to be modifiers of Pkd1-
cystogenesis and could underlie the differences in the kinetics of
cyst formation in early- or late-onset disease models. Finally, we
show that Hnf4a is a modifier of Pkd1-cystogenesis.
Methods
Ethics Statement
All studies were performed using protocols approved by the
JHU and NIH Animal Care and Use Committee, and mice were
kept and cared in pathogen-free animal facilities accredited by the
American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal
Care and meet federal (NIH) guidelines for the humane and
appropriate care of laboratory animal.
Animals
Fifth-generation C57/BL6 Pkd1cko mice were crossed to fifth￾generation C57/BL6 tamoxifen-Cre (B6.Cg-Tg(Cre/Esr1)5Amc/
J mice (stock 004682), Jackson Laboratories) and C57/BL6
congenic B6.129S4-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1Sor/J (stock 003474, Jackson
Laboratories) to produce the mice used in these studies. The
Pkd1cko thus obtained were bred to Hnf4acko mice (B6.129X1(FVB)-
Hnf4atm1.1Gonz/J (stock 004665, Jackson Laboratories). Cre recom￾binase activity was induced by intraperitoneal injection of
tamoxifen (10 mg/40 g) in corn oil (Sigma-Aldrich) in nursing
moms of mice,10 days of age. Mice were euthanized by
isofluorane treatment followed by cervical dislocation.
Histology and Cystic Index
Specimens were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde buffered
solution, pH 7.4 at 4uC overnight, washed in PBS for 2 h,
dehydrated in 50% ethanol for 2 h and stored in 70% ethanol at
room temperature. The kidneys were cut in half along the
longitudinal axis, embedded in paraffin and sectioned in 5-mm
slices for hematoxylin and eosin staining. To calculate the cystic
index, a composite image of a longitudinal midline kidney section
was assembled using Axiovision (Zeiss), and the total kidney and
cystic areas were measured using ImageJ [51]. Statistical analysis
was performed using Student’s t-test.
mRNA and microRNA Profiling
Total RNA was isolated from kidneys using Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen). For mRNA studies, a subsequent step of RNA
isolation using RNeasy plus kit was performed (Qiagen). Illumina’s
MouseRef-8 v1.0 or v2.0 BeadChip expression arrays with sample
processing performed by the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical
Campus Genomics Core. For microRNA expession profiling,
Agilent miRNA arrays were used with the Johns Hopkins Medical
Institute microarray core (http://www.microarray.jhmi.edu).
microRNA real time PCR amplification was performed using
TaqMan MicroRNA reverse transcription kit (4366596, Applied
Biosystems), and the TaqMan microRNA assays has-miR-21,
mmu-miR-31, has-miR-15a, normalized to microRNA snoRNA
202 control (respectively, RT 397, RT 185, RT 389, RT 1232;
Applied Biosystems).
Microarray Data Analysis
Gene expression data were normalized using software provided
by the Bioconductor project [52]. Briefly, we imported gene
expression data using the lumi package, followed by preprocessing
using variance stabilization transformation and quantile normal￾ization [53,54]. The data were filtered to include only probes with
detection call p value,0.05 in at least one of the arrays and
COMBAT software employed to remove batch effects [55]. When
combining datasets of the two different Illumina array versions
(v1.0 and v2.0), only probes present in both versions were
included. For the microRNA data, quantile-normalization was
applied. For both mRNA and microRNA normalized data, Partek
was used to obtain principal component analysis and heatmap
plots, and to identify differentially expressed probes/genes using
ANOVA-based methods and fdr multiple comparison correction.
For meta-analysis of published gene expression data, CEL files of
experiments performed using Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0
arrays (platform GPL1261) were downloaded from GEO (http://
www.wip.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), imported into Partek using
RMA, followed by quantile normalization. All microarray data
have been uploaded to the GEO database (Accession GSE32586).
Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis
For weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)
[56], the WGCNA R package was used [11]. Briefly, soft
thresholding powers were chosen based on the approximate
scale-free topology criterion [56], and applied blockwise network
construction and module detection to the normalized expression
matrix. We then correlated the modules with age and/or mutant
status.
For comparative network analysis, multiSetMEs [11] was used
to identify consensus modules for the 4 experimental groups: P12-
mutant, P12-control, P14-mutant and P14-control, and to
determine module preservation and quantify eigengene correla￾tions [17].
Pathway Analysis
Genomatix Software Suite (Genomatix Inc.) was used to identify
gene ontology, and pathway enrichment. To build knowledge￾based networks, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used (IPA;
Ingenuity Systems). Briefly, matrices were generated with fold￾change and q-value for each of the comparisons of interest (i.e. age
and mutant status) and considered genes with more than 1.2 fold
change and q,0.05 as network eligible molecules. IPA was then
used to screen the Ingenuity Knowledge Base (January 2011
release) for reported interactions involving these genes, to identify
networks that maximize connectivity and to score them based on
the number of network eligible molecules they contain. The
network score corresponds roughly to –log10 (p value).
Urinary Metabolomics
Urine samples were collected at the time of euthanasia, diluted
with 20 volumes of water and spun at 14,0006g for 10 min at 4C.
The supernatant was transferred to an autosampler tube and
analyzed by ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled
with electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass
spectrometry. MarkerLynx software was used to align and
deconvolute the mass chromatographic data and to generate a
data matrix consisting of peak areas corresponding to a unique m/
z and retention time. Statistical analysis was carried out using
Partek, employing unpaired t-test comparing cre positive and
negative animals, and partial least square (PLS) analysis. The
relevant m/z to KEGG ids [57] were identified by searching the
Scripps Center for Metabolomics Database with 5 ppm accuracy
and possible modifications (+H, +NH4, +Na, +H-2H2O, +H￾H2O in the positive mode; 2H, 2H2O-H, +Na-2H, +Cl, +K-2H
in the negative mode) [58]. Verification of acetylcarnitine (m/z
204.123) was obtained by comparing fragmentation patterns of
urine samples with authentic standard by tandem mass spectrom￾Transcriptomics and Metabolomics of ADPKD

etry. For generation of MS/MS fragments, the mass spectrometer
collision energy was ramped from 6 to 40 V. For pathway
enrichment analysis, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used.
