Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury: 
a neglected therapeutic target

Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. In patients with MI, the 
treatment of choice for reducing acute myocardial ischemic injury and limiting MI size is timely and effective 
myocardial reperfusion using either thombolytic therapy or primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). 
However, the process of reperfusion can itself induce cardiomyocyte death, known as myocardial reperfusion 
injury, for which there is still no effective therapy. A number of new therapeutic strategies currently under inves￾tigation for preventing myocardial reperfusion injury have the potential to improve clinical outcomes in patients 
with acute MI treated with PPCI.
Introduction
Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death and 
disability worldwide. According to the WHO, 7,254,000 deaths 
worldwide (12.8% of all deaths) resulted from CHD in 2008. The 
effects of CHD are usually attributable to the detrimental effects 
of acute myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). IRI typi￾cally arises in patients presenting with an acute ST-segment eleva￾tion myocardial infarction (STEMI), in whom the most effective 
therapeutic intervention for reducing acute myocardial ischemic 
injury and limiting the size of myocardial infarction (MI) is timely 
and effective myocardial reperfusion using either thrombolytic 
therapy or primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). 
However, the process of myocardial reperfusion can itself induce 
further cardiomyocyte death, a phenomenon known as myocar￾dial reperfusion injury (1–3). Although the process of myocardial 
reperfusion continues to improve with more timely and effective 
reperfusion and with advances in PCI technology and antiplate￾let and antithrombotic agents for maintaining the patency of the 
infarct-related coronary artery, there is still no effective therapy for 
preventing myocardial reperfusion injury. In this respect, myocar￾dial reperfusion injury remains a neglected therapeutic target for 
cardioprotection in PPCI patients. In this article, the pathophysi￾ology of myocardial lRI and the emerging therapeutic strategies 
for protecting the heart from its detrimental effects are reviewed.
Pathophysiology of myocardial ischemic injury
Acute occlusion of the coronary artery in the STEMI patient sub￾jects the myocardium supplied by that vessel to acute myocardial 
ischemia, thereby demarcating the area at risk (AAR) of potential 
MI, should the acute coronary occlusion be sustained or perma￾nent. If the period of acute myocardial ischemia is prolonged 
(more than 20 minutes) a “wave front” of cardiomyocyte death 
begins in the subendocardium and extends transmurally over time 
toward the epicardium (4).
The deprivation of oxygen and nutrient supply results in a 
series of abrupt biochemical and metabolic changes within the 
myocardium (Figure 1). The absence of oxygen halts oxidative 
phosphorylation, leading to mitochondrial membrane depolar￾ization, ATP depletion, and inhibition of myocardial contractile 
function. This process is exacerbated by the breakdown of any 
available ATP, as the F1F0 ATPase functions in reverse to maintain 
the mitochondrial membrane potential, resulting in ATP hydro￾lysis and an increase in mitochondrial inorganic phosphate. In 
the absence of oxygen, cellular metabolism switches to anaerobic 
glycolysis, resulting in the accumulation of lactate, which reduces 
intracellular pH (to <7.0). The intracellular accumulation of pro￾tons activates the Na+-H+ ion exchanger, which extrudes protons 
from the cell in exchange for Na+ entry. The lack of ATP during 
ischemia ceases function of the 3Na+-2K+ ATPase, thereby exacer￾bating the intracellular Na+ overload. In response, the reverse acti￾vation of the 2Na+-Ca2+ ion exchanger results in intracellular Ca2+
overloading as the cell tries to extrude Na+ (5).
Pathophysiology of myocardial reperfusion injury
After the onset of acute myocardial ischemia in patients with 
STEMI, timely myocardial reperfusion using PPCI is essential to 
salvage viable myocardium, limit MI size, preserve LV systolic func￾tion, and prevent the onset of heart failure. However, the reperfu￾sion of acutely ischemic myocardium can independently induce 
cardiomyocyte death (1–3), although this concept has been diffi￾cult to accept over the years. The four recognized forms of myocar￾dial reperfusion injury are discussed in detail below, the first two 
reversible and the second two irreversible.
Reperfusion-induced arrhythmias. The sudden reperfusion of acute￾ly ischemic myocardium in STEMI patients undergoing PPCI may 
be accompanied by ventricular arrhythmias, which usually self￾terminate or are easily treated (6).
Myocardial stunning. The reversible post-ischemic contractile 
dysfunction that occurs on reperfusing acute ischemic myocar￾dium is referred to as myocardial stunning. This form of reper￾fusion injury results from the detrimental effects of oxidative 
stress and intracellular calcium overload on the myocardial con￾tractile apparatus (7).
Microvascular obstruction. Microvascular obstruction (MVO) was 
first described by Krug et al. in 1966 as the “inability to reperfuse 
a previously ischemic region” (8). The major contributing factors 
include capillary damage with impaired vasodilatation, external 
capillary compression by endothelial cell and cardiomyocyte 
swelling, micro-embolization of friable material released from 
the atherosclerotic plaque, platelet micro-thrombi, the release of 
soluble vasomotor and thrombogenic substances, and neutrophil

plugging (9–12). At coronary angiography in PPCI patients, MVO 
manifests as sluggish coronary blood flow, impaired myocardial 
blush grade, and a characteristic coronary flow velocity profile 
(13). Importantly, 30%–40% of PPCI patients in whom coronary 
blood flow in the infarct-related coronary artery appears nor￾mal on coronary angiography have evidence of MVO as detected 
by myocardial contrast echocardiography (14, 15), myocardial 
perfusion nuclear scanning (16), or contrast-enhanced cardiac 
MRI (17, 18). The presence of MVO is associated with a larger 
MI size, a lower LV ejection fraction, adverse LV remodelling, and 
worse clinical outcomes (15, 19, 20). In severe cases of MVO in 
which there is significant damage to the endothelium, extrava￾sation of blood into the interstitium can produce intramyocar￾dial hemorrhage within the area of infarction, a feature that can 
also be detected by cardiac MRI (21). No effective therapy cur￾rently exists for reducing MVO in patients who have undergone 
PPCI. Whether MVO is actually an independent causative factor 
of reperfusion-induced cardiomyocyte death or is merely a bio￾marker of severe myocardial IRI remains unclear.
Lethal myocardial reperfusion injury. Reperfusion-induced death 
of cardiomyocytes that were viable at the end of the index isch￾emic event is defined as lethal myocardial reperfusion injury (2). 
The major contributory factors are discussed below and include 
oxidative stress, calcium overload, mitochondrial permeabil￾ity transition pore (MPTP) opening, and hypercontracture (3). 
The existence of lethal myocardial reperfusion injury has been 
inferred in both experimental MI models and in patients with 
STEMI by the observation that therapeutic interventions applied 
solely at the onset of myocardial reperfusion reduced MI size by 
40%–50% (3). This observation suggests that lethal myocardial 
reperfusion injury may account for up to 50% of the final MI 
size. Lethal myocardial reperfusion injury attenuates the full 
benefits of myocardial reperfusion in terms of MI size reduction 
and thus represents an important target for cardioprotection in 
PPCI patients (see Figure 2). However, no effective therapy cur￾rently exists for reducing lethal myocardial reperfusion injury in 
patients who have undergone PPCI.
Mediators of myocardial reperfusion injury
Experimental studies have identified several critical factors that 
act in concert to mediate the detrimental effects of myocardial 
reperfusion injury (see Figure 1).
Figure 1
Schematic illustrating the main proponents of acute myocardial IRI. During acute myocardial ischemia, the absence of oxygen switches cell 
metabolism to anaerobic respiration, resulting in the production of lactate and a drop in intracellular pH. This induces the Na+-H+ exchanger to 
extrude H+ and results in intracellular Na+ overload, which activates the 2Na+-Ca2+ exchanger to function in reverse to extrude Na+ and leads to 
intracellular Ca2+ overload. The Na+-K+ ATPase ceases to function in ischemia, exacerbating intracellular Na+ overload. The acidic conditions 
during ischemia prevent the opening of the MPTP and cardiomyocyte hypercontracture at this time. During reperfusion, the electron transport 
chain is reactivated, generating ROS. Other sources of ROS include xanthine oxidase (endothelial cells) and NADPH oxidase (neutrophils). ROS 
mediate myocardial reperfusion injury by inducing the opening of the MPTP, acting as a neutrophil chemoattractant, and mediating dysfunction 
of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). This contributes to intracellular Ca2+ overload and damages the cell membrane by lipid peroxidation, induc￾ing enzyme denaturation and causing direct oxidative damage to DNA. Reperfusion and reactivation of the Na+-H+ exchanger result in washout 
of lactic acid, resulting in the rapid restoration of physiological pH, which releases the inhibitory effect on MPTP opening and cardiomyocyte 
contracture. The restoration of the mitochondrial membrane potential drives calcium into the mitochondria, which can also induce MPTP opening. 
Several hours after the onset of myocardial reperfusion, neutrophils accumulate in the infarcted myocardial tissue in response to the release of 
the chemoattractants ROS, cytokines, and activated complement.

Oxidative stress. In the first few minutes of myocardial reperfu￾sion, a burst of oxidative stress (22, 23) is produced by a variety 
of sources (Figure 1). This detrimental oxidative stress mediates 
myocardial injury and cardiomyocyte death through a number 
of different mechanisms (Figure 1). Based on these observations, 
antioxidant therapy was naturally considered to be an appropriate 
option to prevent such injury. However, both experimental and 
clinical studies have reported mixed results with the administra￾tion of antioxidant therapy at the onset of myocardial reperfu￾sion. The reason for this may in part be due the inability of the 
antioxidant to enter the cell (24). In this regard, the discovery of 
mitochondrial-specific antioxidants may be more effective (25).
Intracellular Ca2+ overload. Intracellular and mitochondrial Ca2+
overload begins during acute myocardial ischemia and is exacer￾bated at the time of myocardial reperfusion due to disruption of 
the plasma membrane, oxidative stress-induced damage to the 
sarcoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondrial re-energization (Fig￾ure 1). Mitochondrial re-energization allows the recovery of the 
mitochondrial membrane potential that drives the entry of Ca2+
into mitochondria via the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter and sub￾sequently induces the opening of the MPTP (Figure 1). Experimen￾tal studies have shown that pharmacologic antagonists of the sar￾colemmal Ca2+ channel (26) or the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter 
(27), administered at the onset of myocardial reperfusion, reduce 
MI size by up to 50%. However, not all experimental studies using 
this therapeutic strategy have been positive. Clinical studies of 
calcium channel blockers administered at the onset of myocar￾dial reperfusion have not shown beneficial results (28). The recent 
identification of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (29) may result 
in the discovery of a new class of specific inhibitors for targeting 
lethal myocardial reperfusion injury.
The rapid restoration of physiological pH at the time of reperfusion. 
During acute myocardial ischemia the intracellular pH decreases 
to less than 7.0, whereas at reperfusion, physiological pH is rap￾idly restored by the washout of lactate and the activation of the 
Na+-H+ exchanger as well as the Na+-HCO– symporter. This pH 
shift contributes to the cardiomyocyte death of lethal myocar￾dial reperfusion injury (30) by permitting MPTP opening and 
cardiomyocyte rigor hypercontracture in the first few minutes 
of reperfusion. Reperfusion of ischemic animal hearts with an 
acidic buffer can reduce MI size (31). Therefore, a potential treat￾ment strategy for preventing lethal myocardial reperfusion injury 
would be to slow the normalization of physiologic pH at the time 
of myocardial reperfusion, which may be achieved via the phar￾macologic inhibition of the Na+-H+ exchanger (5) or by slowing 
the process of myocardial reperfusion, as in the case of ischemic 
postconditioning (IPost) (32), which has been termed “the pH 
hypothesis” by Cohen and Downey (33).
The MPTP: an important target for cardioprotection. Many of the 
above proponents of myocardial reperfusion injury appear to 
converge on the MPTP. The MPTP is a nonselective channel of 
the inner mitochondrial membrane, the opening of which results 
in mitochondrial membrane depolarization and uncoupling of 
oxidative phosphorylation, leading to ATP depletion and cell 
death (34, 35). In the setting of acute myocardial IRI, the MPTP 
has been shown to remain closed during ischemia and only open 
at reperfusion in response to mitochondrial Ca2+ and phosphate 
overload, oxidative stress and relative ATP depletion, and rapid 
pH correction (36). As such, preventing MPTP opening at the 
time of reperfusion by administering known MPTP inhibitors 
(such as the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A) at the onset of 
myocardial reperfusion has been reported in experimental stud￾ies to reduce MI size by 40%–50% in small and large animal MI 
models (37–40) and protect human atrial trabeculae subjected 
to simulated IRI (41). As such, the MPTP provides an important 
therapeutic target for preventing lethal myocardial reperfusion 
injury (see section below).
Inflammation: guilty mediator or innocent bystander. It is unclear 
whether the inflammatory response that accompanies an acute MI 
contributes to the pathogenesis of lethal myocardial reperfusion 
injury or whether it is a reaction to the acute myocardial injury (42). 
Although experimental studies have reported significant reduction 
of MI with therapeutic strategies designed to inhibit the inflamma￾tory process at the time of myocardial reperfusion using antibod￾ies against cell-adhesion molecules (43–45) and the inhibition of 
complement activation (46), corresponding clinical studies using 
this therapeutic approach have been largely negative (47–49).
Late myocardial reperfusion injury: extending the window of cardiopro￾tection. The previously described stimulators of myocardial reperfu￾sion injury all appear to operate in the first few minutes of myo￾cardial reperfusion, providing a narrow window for reducing MI 
size in PPCI patients. However, several other important processes 
such as apoptosis and inflammation, which are also initiated dur￾ing ischemia and continue over several hours into reperfusion, may 
contribute to the development of lethal myocardial reperfusion 
injury. These contributing pathways provide a potential second 
therapeutic window for reducing MI size, even well after myocar￾dial reperfusion has taken place. Consistent with this proposal are 
Figure 2
This figure illustrates the individual contributions of acute myocardi￾al ischemic injury and myocardial reperfusion injury to final MI size 
(expressed in arbitrary units) in STEMI patients up to 24 hours fol￾lowing PPCI. The black solid line depicts the individual contributions 
to final MI size of acute myocardial ischemic injury and of myocardial 
reperfusion injury. The green dashed line depicts the theoretical MI 
size following PPCI based on acute myocardial ischemia alone in the 
absence of myocardial reperfusion injury. The red dashed line depicts 
the theoretical MI size based on acute myocardial ischemia alone in 
the absence of PPCI. The presence of myocardial reperfusion injury 
attenuates the benefit of PPCI in terms of the reduction of MI size. 
Therefore, the administration of a therapeutic strategy as an adjunct to 
PPCI that is capable of reducing myocardial reperfusion injury would 
result in a smaller MI size (as depicted by the green dashed line) and 
take advantage of full benefits of myocardial reperfusion. Figure modi￾fied from Cardiovascular Research (93).

experimental data demonstrating an increase in MI size as reperfu￾sion time progresses, suggesting a wave front of reperfusion injury 
that progress with time (3, 50, 51). However, this is a controversial 
area of research, and some experimental studies have failed to dem￾onstrate an increase in MI size with reperfusion time (52).
Several experimental studies have reported that administering 
cardioprotective agents such as erythropoietin (anti-apoptotic) 
(53), PI3K-γ/δ inhibitors (anti-inflammatory) (54), intracoro￾nary aqueous oxygen (55), and IPost (anti-apoptotic and anti￾inflammatory) (56) from 30 minutes to 24 hours into myocardial 
reperfusion may still limit acute MI size at 72 hours. Whether this 
therapeutic window exists in patients with STEMI who are under￾going PPCI is of great investigational interest, as such a window 
would allow a cardioprotective intervention to be administered 
some hours after the PPCI procedure. This area of research is still 
in its infancy but may suggest or provide an additional therapeutic 
window to target late into the reperfusion phase.
Therapeutic strategies for reducing acute myocardial 
ischemic injury
For patients presenting with a STEMI, the most effective and well￾established therapeutic strategy for reducing acute myocardial 
ischemic injury and limiting MI size is timely myocardial reper￾fusion using either thrombolytic therapy or PPCI. The duration

of acute myocardial ischemia is a critical determinant of MI size, 
and as such, minimizing the time from chest pain onset to PPCI 
is the treatment priority. In the pre-hospital phase this includes 
increasing patient awareness of the symptoms of a MI (in order 
to minimize the delay before the emergency services are contact￾ed), and the rapid diagnosis and transfer of STEMI patients to 
the PPCI center (57). At the hospital, reducing acute myocardial 
ischemic injury requires a treatment protocol that minimizes the 
door-to-PPCI time. In situations in which the transfer time to the 
PPCI center is prolonged, there is an opportunity for paramed￾ics to administer a therapeutic strategy in the ambulance that can 
delay acute myocardial ischemic injury until PPCI has taken place. 
In this respect, the recently published IMMEDIATE clinical trial 
investigated the effects of metabolic modulation using an intra￾venous glucose insulin potassium (GIK) therapy administered in 
the ambulance to patients experiencing acute myocardial ischemia 
with suspected acute coronary syndrome. However, the study 
failed to find any difference in the primary endpoint of progres￾sion to acute MI, although patients with STEMI administered GIK 
therapy experienced less cardiac arrest and in-hospital mortality 
compared with those administered placebo (58).
Therapeutic strategies for reducing myocardial 
reperfusion injury
For patients presenting with a STEMI in whom acute myocardial 
ischemia has already taken place, the opportunity to intervene is 
limited to after the onset of myocardial ischemia or at the time of 
myocardial reperfusion (PPCI). The process of myocardial reperfu￾sion by PPCI continues to be improved with earlier reperfusion, 
advances in PCI technology, and the introduction of more effi￾cacious antiplatelet and antithrombotic agents for maintaining 
the patency of the infarct-related coronary artery. However, there 
remains no effective therapeutic agent for preventing either MVO 
or lethal myocardial reperfusion injury in patients with STEMI 
who are undergoing PPCI. Unfortunately, therapeutic targeting 
of the individual components of lethal myocardial reperfusion 
injury, including oxidative stress, calcium overload, pH correction, 
and, more recently, inflammation have produced disappointing 
results, the reasons for which are discussed below (59, 60).
However, a number of emerging therapeutic strategies for pre￾venting lethal myocardial reperfusion injury have shown prom￾ise in small proof-of-concept clinical studies, and multicenter 
randomized clinical trials are currently underway to investi￾gate the effects of these strategies on clinical outcomes in PPCI 
patients (Tables 1 And 2).
IPost. In contrast to unimpeded reperfusion, IPost is intermit￾tent reperfusion of the acute ischemic myocardium, which has 
been reported to prevent myocardial reperfusion injury and reduce 
MI size by 40%–50% (61). It must be appreciated that IPost rep￾resents a form of modified reperfusion that was demonstrated 
in the 1980s to be beneficial in the form of gradual reperfusion 
(62–65). Staat et al. (66) first applied IPost to the clinical setting 
of PPCI: immediately after direct stenting, coronary blood reflow 
was allowed for 60 seconds, following which the angioplasty bal￾loon was inflated upstream of the stent for 60 seconds to occlude 
coronary blood flow, and this cycle was repeated 4 times in total 
(Table 1). The results of this study confirmed the existence of lethal 
myocardial reperfusion injury in humans (67). A number of clinical 
studies have subsequently confirmed the beneficial effects of IPost, 
although not all studies have had positive results (Table 1). A large 
multicenter randomized clinical trial is now underway in Denmark 
(DANAMI-3) to investigate the effects of IPost on clinical outcomes 
in PPCI patients (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01435408).
Remote ischemic conditioning. IPost requires an invasive therapeu￾tic intervention applied directly to the heart. However, the heart 
can be protected against acute IRI from a distance, by applying 
one or more cycles of brief, nonlethal ischemia and reperfusion 
to another organ or tissue, a phenomenon that has been termed 
remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) (68, 69). In the clinical set￾ting, RIC has been achieved noninvasively by simply inflating 
and deflating a blood pressure cuff placed on the upper arm to 
induce three 5-minute cycles of ischemia and reperfusion (70, 71). 
This therapeutic approach has been reported to be beneficial 
in patients undergoing cardiac surgery (72–75) and in patients 
undergoing elective PCI (76). Most recently, Botker et al. (77) dem￾onstrated that RIC applied by a paramedic to patients with STEMI 
in transit to the PPCI center improved myocardial salvage com￾pared with control patients (Table 1). Again, the patients that ben￾efited most from this therapeutic intervention were those present￾ing with an anterior STEMI and an occluded coronary artery (77). 
Whether RIC can actually improve clinical outcomes following 
PPCI is currently unknown.
Therapeutic hyperoxemia and hypothermia. Two other mechani￾cal interventions that have been reported in animal studies to 
be beneficial against myocardial reperfusion injury include 
therapeutic hyperoxemia (78) and hypothermia (79). Hyperbaric 
oxygen reduces MI size by decreasing tissue edema, reducing for￾mation of lipid peroxide radicals, altering nitric oxide synthase 
expression, and inhibiting leukocyte adherence and plugging in 
the microcirculation. Lowering myocardial temperature during 
ischemia to 32°C–33°C can limit MI size in experimental stud￾ies by reducing metabolic demand, reducing the inflammatory 
response, decreasing platelet aggregation, and increasing myocar￾dial efficiency. Proof-of-concept clinical studies in PPCI patients 
have demonstrated these therapeutic interventions to be poten￾tially promising (Table 1).
Pharmacologic agents for preventing myocardial reperfusion injury. 
Elucidation of the mechanistic pathways underlying IPost have 
resulted in the identification of a number of new targets to prevent 
myocardial reperfusion injury. These include pharmacologic mod￾ulators of the reperfusion injury salvage kinase prosurvival path￾way, such as adenosine, atrial natriuretic peptide, atorvastatin, 
erythropoietin, exenatide, delcasertib, and GIK (Table 2). Other 
agents are known to preserve mitochondrial function during acute 
IRI, such as cyclosporin A, sodium nitrite, and TRO40303 (Table 2). 
However, the results of clinical studies investigating these agents 
have been mixed, with the most promising pharmacologic agents 
being cyclosporin A (80) and exenatide (ref. 81 and Table 2).
Cardiac MRI for assessing acute myocardial IRI
Recent advances in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging 
have made it possible to retrospectively assess several key features 
of acute myocardial IRI in patients with STEMI who have under￾gone PPCI treatment. Performing a CMR scan in the first week 
following PPCI allows the detection and the quantification of sev￾eral important prognostic imaging biomarkers including MI size, 
MVO, and intramyocardial hemorrhage (82). There is also the 
potential to measure myocardial salvage, with the AAR delineated 
by T2-weighted imaging of myocardial edema (83–85). However, 
this technique for measuring the AAR has its limitations and fur-

review series

ther study is required to validate its use (86–88). A repeat scan 
performed 4 to 6 months later provides an assessment of final MI 
size and post-MI LV remodeling in PPCI patients. Therefore, the 
availability of CMR allows the assessment of the efficacy of thera￾peutic strategies for preventing acute myocardial IRI and provides 
robust surrogate endpoints of cardioprotection for future clinical 
studies. However, it must be appreciated that surrogate endpoints 
to assess the efficacy of therapeutic interventions should be used 
to inform the design of larger, multicenter, randomized clinical 
trials with hard clinical endpoints.
Improving translation of cardioprotection
The research field of cardioprotection has been plagued by the large 
number of failed attempts to translate promising therapeutic strat￾egies for preventing lethal myocardial reperfusion injury discovered 
in the basic science laboratory into the clinical setting. The reasons 
for this failure have been discussed in detail elsewhere (59, 60, 89, 90) 
and can be summarized as the use of inappropriate experimental 
animal models, the clinical testing of inconclusive therapies, and 
poor clinical trial design. Many experimental MI models fail to rep￾resent the clinical setting of an MI in terms of comorbidities (such 
as age, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension) and concomitant 
medication, the presence of which may interfere with the therapeu￾tic cardioprotective intervention (91). The therapeutic interven￾tion should confer conclusive cardioprotection in all experimen￾tal animal models tested before being investigated in the clinical 
setting. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) 
formed the CAESAR Consortium, a network of research centers in 
the United States (92) in which small and large animal models of 
experimental MI are used to investigate any promising cardiopro￾tective strategies using an approach akin to a multicenter, random￾ized, controlled clinical trial. Finally, in terms of improving clinical 
study design, several recent strategy documents (60, 92) have sug￾gested the following guidelines: only patients with anterior STEMI 
with complete occlusion of coronary flow and no collaterals should 
be included; the therapeutic intervention should be administered 
prior to myocardial reperfusion; and relevant endpoints pertinent 
to acute cardioprotection should be used.
Conclusions
Acute myocardial IRI is the major cause of the detrimental effects 
of CHD on the myocardium. This form of myocardial injury is 
characterized in STEMI patients who present with acute myo￾cardial ischemia, in whom treatment priority is timely and effec￾tive myocardial reperfusion using either thrombolytic therapy or 
PPCI. Although improvements in myocardial reperfusion contin￾ue to take place in terms of new antiplatelet and antithrombotic 
agents, there is still no effective therapeutic strategy for preventing 
myocardial reperfusion injury. However, this is an active area of 
ongoing research, with the recent discovery of several mechanical 
and pharmacologic adjuncts to PPCI for preventing myocardial 
reperfusion injury. Multicenter, randomized clinical trials are now 
underway to investigate whether these emerging therapeutic strat￾egies for reducing acute myocardial IRI can improve clinical out￾comes in patients with CHD.
