Abstract
Background: Appendicitis occurs with increased frequency in HIV infected compared to HIV uninfected persons.
CMV-related appendicitis specifically presents with typical appendicitis symptoms including surgical abdomen,
fever and leukocytosis and may have a more severe course with higher mortality than other types of infective
appendicitis. We report the first case of CMV appendicitis as a manifestation of Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory
Syndrome (IRIS).
Case presentation: The patient was a 38 year old woman with a recent diagnosis of HIV infection who complained of
right lower quadrant pain, anorexia, nausea and fevers two weeks after initiating antiretroviral therapy. Acute
appendicitis was suspected and the patient underwent an appendectomy. Pathologic examination of the resected
appendiceal tissue demonstrated inflammation with perforation and cytopathic changes typical of CMV that were
positive for CMV by immunostain. This presentation of CMV abruptly after antiretroviral therapy initiation with a
pronounced cellular infiltration of the tissue, is consistent with CMV-IRIS presenting as appendicitis.
Conclusions: Appendicitis can be a rare manifestation of CMV-IRIS in HIV-infected patients who start antiretroviral
therapy. Evaluation of appendiceal tissue for cytopathic changes and CMV should be considered in acute appendicitis
in HIV infected persons.

Background
Combination anti-retroviral therapy (ART) has reduced
the mortality from cytomegalovirus (CMV) opportunistic
infections in HIV positive patients [1]. CMV continues to
result in morbidity and mortality in patients initiating
ART at low CD4 T-cell counts, occasionally as a result of
immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).
We present a case of unmasking CMV-IRIS in an HIV￾infected patient following ART initiation.
Appendicitis occurs with increased frequency in HIV
infected patients as compared to HIV uninfected pa￾tients [2]. A number of opportunistic pathogens or AIDS
related malignancies have been shown to cause appendi￾citis in HIV-infected patients, including Kaposi sarcoma
[3], Strongyloides [4], Mycobacterium tuberculosis [5], and
Mycobacterium avium complex [6].
Tucker et al. published the first report of CMV appen￾dicitis in an HIV positive patient in 1989 [7] and, since
that time, ten additional reports of CMV appendicitis
in HIV patients have been described in the literature
[8-16]. Ten of the eleven reported patients presented
with right lower quadrant pain and in eight of them fever
was noted at the time of presentation (see Table 1) [7-16].
CMV appendicitis typically presents with similar symp￾toms [17,18], but may have a higher mortality than other
identified etiologies of appendicitis [12,17].
In a study of autopsies of HIV positive patients, CMV
was the most commonly isolated opportunistic infection,
though the vast majority of the patients were asymptom￾atic while alive [19]. In this particular patient, the biopsy
demonstrated substantial inflammation and necrosis as
well as abundant CMV positive cells, making CMV

the likely cause of appendicitis, rather than an incidental
finding.
Case presentation
The patient enrolled in an Institutional Review Board￾approved, prospective study of HIV-1 infected, ART naïve
patients with CD4 count below 100 cells/μL in Bethesda,
Maryland, one month after a new HIV diagnosis. At the
time of enrollment, the patient complained of a 23 Kg
weight loss and had a CD4 count of 72 T cells/μL and a
plasma HIV-RNA of 284,010 copies/ml. The viral geno￾type showed wild type virus and she was initiated on
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir. Her blood CMV PCR
was negative at baseline, CMV IgG was positive (4.460 U)
and CMV IgM was negative.
Two weeks after ART initiation, the patient returned
to care with a four-day history of cramping abdominal
pain predominantly in the right lower quadrant as well
as nausea and anorexia without chills, vomiting, diarrhea,
urinary symptoms, or vaginal discharge. The patient was fe￾brile (38.8°C) and tachycardic (124 bpm). Abdominal exam
revealed normoactive bowel sounds with direct tenderness
to palpation in the lower abdominal quadrants (right more
than left). Guarding, rigidity, and rebound were absent and
the remainder of the exam was noncontributory.
CBC demonstrated leukopenia (leukocytes 2.58 K/μL)
with 0.8% immature granulocytes. Alkaline phosphatase
was 186 IU/L (up from 140 IU/L at baseline), with nor￾mal liver and pancreatic enzyme levels. The CRP had in￾creased to 8.52 mg/dl from 1.95 mg/dl at baseline. Blood
CMV PCR became detectable at 750 copies/ml. An ab￾dominal CT scan demonstrated thickening of the appen￾dix with fat stranding and mild lymphadenopathy of the
pelvic sidewall, predominantly on the right side consistent
with appendicitis. The patient underwent an uncompli￾cated laparoscopic appendectomy, received IV metronida￾zole and vancomycin perioperatively, and was discharged
on post-op day three.
Pathologic examination of the patient’s appendiceal tis￾sue demonstrated appendicitis with sealed perforation
and evidence of CMV infection. There was marked
lymphoid hyperplasia with mature lymphocytes and
plasma cells (Figure 1A). Immunohistochemistry showed
that the lymphocytic infiltration was composed of a mix￾ture of T cells and polyclonal B cells with equal distribu￾tion of immunoglobulin light chain kappa and lambda
staining, making lymphoma unlikely. Neutrophilic in￾filtration was scarce. In situ hybridization for EBV virus
encoded small RNA (EBER) was negative. CMV viral
staining was positive in numerous cells showing typ￾ical cytopathic changes of CMV infection including
cellular and nuclear enlargement and nuclear inclusions
(Figure 1B), and were distributed throughout the full
thickness of the bowel wall.
The patient returned to clinic after 3 weeks with com￾plaints of increased abdominal pain and two episodes of
hematochezia. Valganciclovir was initiated for suspected
CMV colitis (endoscopy could not be performed due to
the recent abdominal surgery). The patient completed
two weeks of valganciclovir therapy with complete reso￾lution of all symptoms.
Conclusions
It has been hypothesized that appendicitis in HIV positive
patients could be a result of IRIS, likely due to reactive
lymphoid tissue in the appendix [20,21]. Although CMV￾IRIS in HIV-infected patients has been mostly reported as
uveitis in those with CMV retinitis [22], appendicitis can
be a rare manifestation of CMV in this clinical setting.
This patient represents the first published case of appendi￾citis as a result of CMV-IRIS. Given the frequency of
CMV co-infection and wide distribution of CMV in the
gastrointestinal tracts of patients with AIDS, a proportion
of excess cases of appendicitis in the HIV-infected popula￾tion may be related to emergent immune responses to
CMV after ART initiation.
