Abstract
Transthyretin amyloidosis is a progressive and eventually fatal disease primarily characterized by sensory, motor, and
autonomic neuropathy and/or cardiomyopathy. Given its phenotypic unpredictability and variability, transthyretin
amyloidosis can be difficult to recognize and manage. Misdiagnosis is common, and patients may wait several years
before accurate diagnosis, risking additional significant irreversible deterioration. This article aims to help physicians
better understand transthyretin amyloidosis—and, specifically, familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy—so they can
recognize and manage the disease more easily and discuss it with their patients. We provide guidance on making a
definitive diagnosis, explain methods for disease staging and evaluation of disease progression, and discuss
symptom mitigation and treatment strategies, including liver transplant and several pharmacotherapies that have
shown promise in clinical trials.

Introduction
Transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis is a systemic disorder
characterized by the extracellular deposition of amyloid
fibrils composed of TTR, a plasma transport protein for
thyroxine and vitamin A that is produced predominantly
by the liver. TTR can dissociate from its native tetramer
form, then misfold and aggregate into amyloid fibrils that
accumulate in various organs and tissues, causing progres￾sive dysfunction. TTR amyloidosis is the most common
form of hereditary (familial) amyloidosis, and is caused by
mutations that destabilize the TTR protein. TTR amyloid￾osis also encompasses an age-related amyloidosis known
as senile systemic amyloidosis, an acquired disorder
mainly affecting men after the age of 60 years, that results
from the deposition of wild-type TTR amyloid.
TTR amyloidosis can present as a progressive, axonal
sensory autonomic and motor neuropathy (familial
amyloidotic polyneuropathy; TTR-FAP, also known as
FAP or ATTR-PN) or as an infiltrative cardiomyopathy
(familial amyloid cardiomyopathy). TTR amyloidosis, in￾cluding TTR-FAP, presents in many different forms, with
considerable phenotypic variation across individuals and
geographic locations. Diagnosis can be challenging and
treatment often requires a multidisciplinary approach.
Physicians likely to diagnose and treat patients with this
disease include neurologists, cardiologists, gastroentero￾logists, ophthalmologists, and other specialists.
The recommendations offered here, which focus pri￾marily on the management of polyneuropathy symptoms,
are based on the published literature, information gleaned
from the Transthyretin Amyloidosis Outcomes Survey
(THAOS) – a TTR amyloidosis patient registry, and the
opinions of the authors. To further assist the treating
physician, Appendix A contains lists of recommended
reading and helpful websites.
Background
In 1952 Andrade reported a large group of patients in
Portugal who had TTR-FAP with the Val30Met TTR
mutation [1]. Over the next two decades other large foci
were discovered in Japan and Sweden. Initially, TTR-FAP
was thought to be restricted to endemic occurrences
in those areas. However, owing to progress in bioche

mical and molecular genetic analyses, TTR-FAP is now
diagnosed worldwide. Most cases involve small kindreds
or patients with no family history of the disease. To date,
about 120 different single or double mutations, or a
deletion in the TTR gene, have been reported; the majority
of these TTR mutations are amyloidogenic, with fewer
than ten considered non-pathogenic [2,3]. Val30Met is the
most common mutation and the only one found in large
foci of patients.
Some mutations induce cardiomyopathy as the predo￾minant feature (e.g. Val122Ile, Ile68Leu, Thr60Ala,
Leu111Met) while others are associated primarily with
neuropathy (e.g. Val30Met), but both manifestations can
be present in different proportions [4]. Less common dis￾ease signs include vitreous opacities, renal disease, and
meningeal involvement. While genotype and population
origin are important determinants of symptoms, the cli￾nical picture of an affected individual may deteriorate over
time (as amyloid continues to deposit in other tissues),
and variability may be observed within the same family.
Genetics
TTR-FAP has autosomal dominant inheritance with
variable penetrance. Carriers of the mutation have a cir￾culating variant protein from fetal life but no amyloid
deposition or symptomatic disease until adulthood, with
development of disease probably controlled by factors
associated with the biochemistry of aging [3,5]. The
penetrance of the gene varies in different regions of the
world and among families [6-8]. There is some evidence
that affected women transmit higher disease penetrance
to their offspring than affected men [9]. Because pene￾trance is incomplete, carriers of the gene may live to an
advanced age without symptoms of the disease but may
see their children become clinically affected. Genetic
anticipation (earlier onset with greater severity in
subsequent generations) has been observed in endemic
regions [6,10-12].
Prevalence and age at onset of TTR amyloidosis
Val30Met is the most prevalent TTR-FAP mutation in
the world, focused in Portugal, Sweden, Japan, Brazil,
and Majorca, and is believed to have arisen independ￾ently in Portugal and Sweden [13-15]. The largest cluster
of individuals with TTR-FAP caused by the Val30Met
mutation may be found in northern Portugal (Póvoa de
Varzim and Vila do Conde), where the incidence is
estimated to be one in 538 individuals [16]. In contrast,
the incidence of hereditary TTR amyloidosis in the
United States is estimated to be one in 100,000
individuals [17]. The cardiomyopathy-related Leu111Met
and Val122Ile mutations are found primarily in Danish
and African American populations, respectively. How￾ever, all mutations, including Val30Met, are identified
across all countries in different families without any ob￾vious relationship.
In Europe, the prevalence of TTR-FAP is estimated to
be less than one in 100,000 individuals [18]. In endemic
areas of northern Sweden (Piteå and Skelleftå), the fre￾quency of the Val30Met mutation is 4%; however, the
penetrance is relatively low (11% by 50 years) [6].
Conversely, in Portugal, the penetrance is high (80% by
50 years) [7]. Although also endemic in some areas of
Japan, the prevalence of TTR-FAP is estimated to be
lower than in Europe, at approximately one in 1,000,000
individuals [19].
The frequency of the Val122Ile mutation in the African
American population is 3% to 3.9% [20,21], with most
individuals developing late-onset cardiac amyloidosis.
The frequency of Val122Ile in Caucasian and Hispanic
populations in the United States is 0.44% and 0%, respect￾ively [21]. The worldwide prevalence of TTR amyloidosis
dominated by cardiomyopathy is unknown, but it is al￾most certainly underdiagnosed, particularly in the African
American Val122Ile carrier population older than 65 years
(approximately 135,000 individuals) [22,23].
The age at onset of disease-related symptoms varies
between the second and ninth decades of life, with great
variations across different populations. Expected age at
onset is critical to determine when amyloidosis testing
should be requisitioned. Portuguese and Japanese foci of
patients with TTR-FAP have traditionally been described
as early-onset (mean age, 33 years) [24,25], whereas
Swedish patients with TTR-FAP are characterized by a
later mean age of onset (56 years) [26]. Even in foci gen￾erally considered early-onset, some subgroups of patients
experience a later onset. In Japan, especially, a form of
later-onset TTR-FAP with no genealogical relationship to
the two foci of this disease now predominates [24,27].
Patients with cardiomyopathy who have wild-type or vari￾ant TTR traditionally develop symptoms in their sixties.
The mean duration of disease onset to death is approxi￾mately 10 years but may vary depending on endemic
region, genotype, symptoms, and other factors.
Clinical presentation of TTR amyloidosis with
polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP)
TTR-FAP is a multi-symptom disease that may present
with peripheral neuropathy (sensory and motor), auto￾nomic neuropathy, gastrointestinal impairment, cardio￾myopathy, nephropathy, or ocular deposition. While the
symptoms described below, including those of Val30Met
TTR-FAP patients, may be present in patients with dif￾ferent TTR-FAP genotypes, phenotypes are not always
uniform, and the same point mutation may have varied
phenotypes even within the same family. Generally, how￾ever, most TTR-FAP cases are classified as neuropathic.

Variation in neuropathies of Val30Met TTR-FAP
The clinical picture for Val30Met TTR-FAP differs con￾siderably between patients originating from endemic foci
and patients with non-endemic origins [28]. In the
former, disease onset often occurs before the age of
40 years, with a progressive sensory-motor and auto￾nomic neuropathy, eventually causing cachexia and
death 10 to 20 years after onset. Although sensory and
motor manifestations are generally the presenting
symptoms, the first clinical presentation can be auto￾nomic neuropathy. However, even when the disease
starts with sensory neuropathy, autonomic neuropathies
often follow [29]. Patients with Val30Met TTR-FAP and
non-endemic origins typically have onset at a late age
(usually after the age of 60), with male predominance
and an apparently sporadic disease presentation. Sensory
and motor neuropathy symptoms of both upper and
lower extremities may appear within a short period or
even simultaneously, while autonomic neuropathies may
be relatively mild [30-32].
Peripheral nerve dysfunction
TTR amyloidosis induces a length-dependent peripheral
neuropathy. Initially the lower limbs are affected, and
symptoms generally include toe discomfort such as
numbness and spontaneous pain. At this stage, as amyl￾oid typically first affects small nerve fibers altering pain
and temperature sensation, clinical examination may
detect impaired thermal sensitivity in the feet, with
decreased pinprick sensation. In contrast, light touch
may be relatively preserved and proprioception spared.
Muscle strength and tendon reflexes are normal. This
neuropathic manifestation typically reflects the involve￾ment of unmyelinated and small myelinated fibers. A
few months later sensory loss extends above the ankle
on both sides. The neurologic deficit then progresses re￾lentlessly, with the extension of sensory loss toward the
proximal lower limbs. Motor deficit appears in the distal
lower limbs, as does the impairment of light touch and
deep sensations, which indicates the involvement of lar￾ger sensory and motor nerve fibers. Walking becomes
increasingly difficult with loss of balance and steppage
gait. Neuropathic pain is often of the burning type and
is worse at night and associated with allodynia. As
months and years pass, sensory deficit extends to the
thighs, then the upper limbs, forearms, and fingers as
the anterior trunk is involved. Motor deficits also follow
a length-dependent progression and walking without as￾sistance becomes increasingly difficult. Life-threatening
autonomic dysfunction is generally present at this stage
along with weight loss and muscle wasting. Loss of pain
sensation with preservation of strength leads to painless
trauma and the development of plantar ulcers and foot
osteoarthropathy (Charcot’s joints) [33]. Due to the
random distribution of amyloid in the peripheral ner￾vous system, deposits may accumulate locally and induce
focal deficit of a cranial nerve, nerve trunk, or plexus.
Carpal tunnel syndrome is an early but nonspecific
manifestation of TTR-FAP. It should be noted that many
patients with TTR-FAP are erroneously diagnosed with
simple carpal tunnel syndrome; progressive symptoms
or lack of improvement after carpal tunnel release sur￾gery often leads to the correct diagnosis.
In patients who have peripheral neuropathy of un￾known origin, testing for autonomic dysfunction should
be considered because patients may not show overt
symptoms of autonomic failure. Early recognition of auto￾nomic failure may lead to an earlier diagnosis of the
underlying pathogenesis of amyloidosis [34].
Other system involvement
Autonomic nervous system involvement includes anhi￾drosis, sexual impotence, disturbances of gastrointestinal
motility (most commonly diarrhea alternating with consti￾pation, but also constipation, diarrhea, nausea, and
vomiting), orthostatic hypotension, and neurogenic blad￾der. In our experience, cardiac disease occurs in approxi￾mately 50% of patients with TTR-FAP, with most TTR
mutations causing amyloid cardiomyopathy [35]. Anemia
due to low erythropoietin levels also may be observed
[36]. Ocular involvement, such as vitreous opacity, dry
eye, glaucoma, and pupillary disorders, is common [37]. In
contrast, kidney involvement is unusual.
Additional symptoms of TTR-FAP include hoarseness,
coldness, decreased skin temperature, dyscoria, dyses￾thesia, muscle weakness and atrophy, dissociated anes￾thesia, and constitutional conditions such as weight loss,
arrhythmia, edema, and burning.
When should a neurologist suspect TTR-FAP?
It is important to differentiate a diagnostic process in
individuals with a known amyloid family history, espe￾cially in endemic areas, from that in patients without
such a history (Table 1). In patients with a known family
history of TTR-FAP, the onset of symptoms and signs of
peripheral neuropathy, manifestations of autonomic
dysfunction, and cardiac arrhythmia call for confirm￾ation of the involvement of these organs by appropriate
investigations (see Tests and Assessments, below). When
there is no known family history of amyloidosis, the
diagnosis of TTR-FAP should be considered in patients
with a progressive, length-dependent axonal polyneurop￾athy predominantly affecting temperature and pain sen￾sation. Special attention must be paid to patients with
concurrent autonomic dysfunction, cardiac involvement,
and carpal tunnel syndrome.
The multisystem involvement of TTR-FAP is a clue to
the diagnosis. It is important to consider the diagnosis
Ando et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2013, 8:31 Page 3 of 18
http://www.ojrd.com/content/8/1/31

of TTR-FAP when one or, especially, several of the
following are present:
 Family history of neuropathic disease, especially
associated with heart failure
 Neuropathic pain or progressive sensory
disturbances of unknown etiology
 Carpal tunnel syndrome without obvious cause,
particularly if it is bilateral and requires surgical
release
 Gastrointestinal motility disturbances or autonomic
nerve dysfunction of unknown etiology (e.g. erectile
dysfunction, orthostatic hypotension, neurogenic
bladder)
 Cardiac disease characterized by thickened
ventricular walls in the absence of hypertension
 Advanced atrio-ventricular block of unknown origin,
particularly when accompanied by a thickened heart
 Vitreous body inclusions of the cotton-wool type
TTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy
Although TTR amyloidosis is considered principally a
neurologic disease, the clinical spectrum varies widely
from almost exclusive neurologic involvement within an
endemic cohort to a strictly cardiologic presentation in
sporadic cases [38-41]. TTR-related cardiac amyloidosis
is thought to be vastly underdiagnosed, particularly
when neurologic involvement is mild or absent [42].
Cardiovascular manifestations
In both hereditary and nonhereditary TTR amyloidosis,
as in amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis, amyloid can
infiltrate any or all of the cardiovascular structures, in￾cluding the conduction system, the atrial and ventricular
myocardium, valvular tissue, and the coronary and large
arteries [38,39,43]. The conduction system is commonly
affected, leading to bundle branch block and, occasionally,
atrioventricular (AV) and sinoatrial block. Myocardial infil￾tration progressively increases the thickness of the left and
right ventricular walls and the interventricular septum.
Cardiac amyloidosis is generally considered to be a cardio￾myopathy with a hypertrophic phenotype and restrictive
pathophysiology, although a true restrictive filling pattern
is seen only in advanced stages [44]. Left ventricular (LV)
ejection fraction is normal or only mildly reduced. How￾ever, abnormalities in long-axis function of both ventricles

on tissue Doppler imaging are frequent and precede the
impairment of circumferential ventricular function [45].
The involvement of the cardiac valves leads to the forma￾tion of nodules or diffuse thickening of the leaflets, accom￾panied by variable degrees (generally mild) of valvular
regurgitation. The clinical spectrum of cardiovascular in￾volvement is wide, ranging from asymptomatic AV and
bundle branch block to severe, rapidly progressive heart
failure due to restrictive pathophysiology. These variations
are related to the specific TTR mutation, geographic area,
and endemic/non-endemic demographics of individual
cases.
When should a cardiologist suspect TTR amyloidosis?
Cardiologists may encounter TTR amyloidosis in pa￾tients who are referred with neurologic impairment or
previously diagnosed TTR-FAP, and in patients who
present with cardiologic problems without any apparent
signs of neurologic disease. If there is a strong suspicion
or an existing diagnosis of TTR-FAP, the cardiologist
should look for signs of cardiac amyloid involvement
(Appendix B). In such situations, electrocardiogra￾phy (ECG), echocardiography, scintigraphy with bone
tracers, biomarkers (brain natriuretic peptide [BNP] and
troponin I or T) and cardiac magnetic resonance
imaging usually provide all the necessary information to
diagnose infiltrative cardiomyopathy. The study of
longitudinal LV function with tissue Doppler echo￾cardiography and 99mTc-3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propano￾dicarboxylic acid (99mTc-DPD) myocardial scintigraphy
are particularly revealing for very early signs of myocar￾dial involvement [45-47]. Although as a general rule
histological evidence of amyloid deposits is essential for
a final diagnosis of amyloidosis, in a patient with mo￾lecularly proven diagnosis of TTR amyloidosis, identifi￾cation of unexplained ventricular hypertrophy and other
typical instrumental findings (see below) provides con￾vincing evidence of amyloidotic cardiomyopathy.
When the phenotypic expression of TTR amyloidosis
is exclusively or predominantly cardiac, the situation is
far more challenging. Affected patients may present for
a wide variety of reasons, including symptoms of heart
failure, arrhythmias, syncope, orthostatic hypotension,
and ECG/echocardiographic abnormalities in the ab￾sence of symptoms. The problem of differential diagno￾sis from cardiomyopathies of other causes is common,
and a frequent pitfall is the misdiagnosis of cardiac
amyloidosis as sarcomeric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
A particularly challenging situation regards elderly
African-Americans with hypertension, increased LV wall
thickness, and minimal or no neuropathy, since a diag￾nosis of TTR amyloidosis in such patients may be
overlooked. A logical first step is to look for the
infiltrative phenotype with echocardiography and for any
major discrepancy between the assessment of LV mass
with echocardiography and ECG (for example, when
increased mass via echocardiography is not accompanied
by ECG signs of LV hypertrophy) [38,42]. Another useful
clue can be the recognition of right-sided heart failure,
unusual in hypertensive heart disease [42]. 99mTc-DPD
scintigraphy can assist in the differential diagnosis
between TTR-related cardiomyopathy and sarcomeric
hyptertrophic cardiomyopathy, since only myocardium
infiltrated by TTR uptakes the tracer [48].
Apart from evident neurologic manifestations, some clin￾ical signs can raise the suspicion of hereditary TTR amyl￾oidosis in a patient with apparently isolated hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy. These signs include a history of carpal
tunnel syndrome, sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy, un￾explained intense myalgias and burning sensations, and
autonomic dysfunction. Careful evaluation for these signs
is mandatory, as they can sometimes be very mild and may
not be reported by the patient.
Leptomeningeal TTR amyloidosis
Attention has recently focused on the relatively rare
leptomeningeal form of TTR amyloidosis, which is
induced by several point mutations in the TTR gene and
also found in the advanced stages of Val30Met TTR-FAP
[37]. In most cases, it is believed that the source of
variant TTR in leptomeningeal amyloidosis is not the
liver but the choroid plexus [49]. Cerebral amyloid
angiopathy and ocular amyloidosis are common clinical
features of this type of TTR amyloidosis. Cerebral amyl￾oid angiopathy is characterized by amyloid deposition in
the media and adventitia of medium-sized and small ar￾teries, arterioles, and, occasionally, veins of the cortex
and leptomeninges. Typical clinical central nervous
system manifestations include cerebral infarction and
hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, ataxia, spastic paralysis,
convulsion, and dementia. These symptoms are often
found in several types of TTR amyloidosis and they lead
to the classification of (oculo)leptomeningeal amyloid￾osis, in which amyloid deposition is also found in vitre￾ous bodies and other tissues of the eye. Although
amyloid deposits in the meningocerebrovascular system
are thought to be the cause of those central nervous
system symptoms, the precise mechanism of amyloid
formation remains to be elucidated.
Other organ involvement
Gastrointestinal symptoms, as a manifestation of auto￾nomic neuropathy, are recognized from an early stage of
TTR-FAP and include nausea, early satiety, recurrent
vomiting, watery diarrhea, severe constipation, and/or
alternating diarrhea and constipation. As a result, weight
loss may be observed in the course of the disease. Renal
complications, while infrequent, include albuminuria
Ando et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2013, 8:31 Page 5 of 18
http://www.ojrd.com/content/8/1/31

and/or mild azotemias. Dry eye is an early autonomic
symptom of TTR-FAP, and a decrease in visual acuity
induced by vitreous opacity or glaucoma is recognized
as TTR-FAP progresses.
Tests and assessments
Overview
Neurologic examination should indicate the presence or
absence of a length-dependent sensorimotor axonal
neuropathy affecting temperature and pain detection in
the feet. Ultimately a patient should undergo a complete
neurologic examination, which may include electromyo￾graphic testing with sympathetic skin response (SSR),
quantitative sensory testing, heart rate deep breathing,
and other autonomic tests, determined by presenting
physical signs. Cardiac evaluation should include ECG,
echocardiography, BNP/troponin measurement and, in
select cases, cardiac magnetic resonance, scintigraphy
with bone tracers, and Holter monitoring. Following
this workup the patient should undergo a DNA ana￾lysis and tissue biopsy (Table 1), although the uneven
distribution of amyloid fibrils may yield false-negative
results. While experienced neurologists in endemic
areas may be able to diagnose TTR-FAP by the pres￾ence of reported family history of the disease as well as
relevant symptoms alone, a biopsy showing amyloid
deposits is mandatory in patients without a family his￾tory (late-onset and apparently sporadic forms) and in
populations with a low disease prevalence. Genetic
testing is needed to document the pathogenic muta￾tion. If it is normal, TTR-FAP is excluded. Symptoms
and stage of disease progression can be identified by
neurologic tests and the modified body mass index
(mBMI; BMI multiplied by serum albumin level [g/L]
to compensate for edema formation) [50], a measure of
nutritional status and wasting.
Diagnosis
Tissue biopsy
To confirm amyloidosis, the demonstration of amyloid
deposits via tissue biopsy is essential. Deposition of
amyloid in the tissue can be demonstrated by Congo red
staining of biopsy specimens [51]. With Congo red
staining, amyloid deposits show a characteristic green bi￾refringence under polarized light. Tissues suitable for bi￾opsy include subcutaneous fatty tissue of the abdominal
wall, kidney, skin, gastric, or rectal mucosa; sural nerve
tissue; retinaculum and peritendinous fat obtained at
carpal tunnel surgery; and tissue from the salivary gland.
The sensitivity of endoscopic biopsy of the gastrointestinal
mucosa is approximately 85%, whereas biopsy of the sural
nerve is less sensitive because amyloid deposition is often
sporadic and random [52]. TTR immunolabeling of
the amyloid deposits can identify the disease as TTR
amyloidosis but cannot distinguish wild-type from heredi￾tary forms. In patients with typical signs and symptoms of
TTR amyloidosis, negative biopsy results should not be
interpreted as excluding the disease.
Serum variant TTR protein
TTR protein normally circulates in serum or plasma as a
soluble protein with a tetrameric structure. The normal
plasma TTR concentration is 20 to 40 mg dL–1 (0.20 to
0.40 mg mL–1
). After immunoprecipitation with anti￾TTR antibody, serum variant TTR protein can be
detected by mass spectrometry [53]. Approximately 90%
of TTR variants identified exhibit the mass shift
predicted by the one amino acid substitution of the vari￾ant TTR [54].
Genetic confirmation
Although mass spectrometry can demonstrate a mass dif￾ference between wild-type and TTR protein variants in
serum, it does not specify the site and kind of amino acid
substitution in a number of disease-related TTR gene
mutations; thus, DNA sequencing is usually required.
Current techniques for performing sequence analysis of
TTR, the only gene known to be associated with TTR
amyloidosis, detect >99% of disease-causing mutations.
Exclusionary diagnoses
AL amyloidosis
The diagnosis of AL amyloidosis is often considered due
to the high incidence of monoclonal gammopathies in the
elderly. Differentiation of AL and TTR amyloid polyneur￾opathy requires analysis of the subunit protein comprising
amyloid tissue deposits. Amyloid immunohistochemical
staining has been the standard approach; however, the
antibody staining can be misleading because of suboptimal
antibody reagents or excessive background staining. In
contrast, immunoelectron microscopy may provide a
clear-cut characterization of amyloid fibrils, but this tech￾nique is not widely available. Mass spectrometry-based
proteomic analysis or immuno-gold electron microscopy
can be useful in this setting, but TTR genopositivity
should be established by DNA analysis in all cases of
suspected FAP.
Mimicking neuropathies
Some adult patients with diabetes mellitus may develop
a polyneuropathy similar to TTR-FAP with early and
predominant small-fiber involvement and autonomic
dysfunction. Chronic alcoholism can also induce a
peripheral neuropathy that is indistinguishable from
TTR-FAP disease.
Ando et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2013, 8:31 Page 6 of 18
http://www.ojrd.com/content/8/1/31

Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP)
When a family history is not known, a diagnosis of CIDP
is often considered first. In CIDP, large myelinated fiber
dysfunction predominates, with slow conduction vel￾ocity, high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein content,
and virtually no symptoms of autonomic dysfunction.
However, axonal lesions predominate in some cases. In
addition, nerve conduction velocity is often mildly
decreased in patients with TTR-FAP, and CSF protein
content can be elevated, which may increase the confu￾sion with CIDP [40]. In such cases, a nerve biopsy
may differentiate amyloid from CIDP by revealing
congophilic deposits.
Other exclusions
Other diagnoses to exclude are familial amyloid poly￾neuropathy (gelsolin type, apolipoprotein A1 type), other
types of inherited sensory polyneuropathy, hereditary
sensory and autonomic neuropathies, Fabry’s disease,
leprous neuropathy, anxiety, irritable bowel syndrome,
cardiac disorders (e.g. arrhythmias, cardiac failure), ocu￾lar disorders (e.g. macular degeneration), alcoholism,
and vitamin B12 deficiency.
Tests for neuropathic symptoms
Neuropathic symptoms can be assessed by the polyneur￾opathy disability (PND) score; neuropathy symptom
score; neurologic disability score (NDS); neuropathy im￾pairment score (total NIS), and neuropathy impairment
score–lower limb (NIS-LL), scales that quantify neuro￾logic function in patients with diabetic polyneuropathy
but are also valuable for patients with TTR-FAP; auto￾nomic reflex screen; composite autonomic severity score;
mBMI; electromyography with SSR; and other original
scores or local variants.
Tools for evaluating TTR-FAP progression
The progression of TTR-FAP can be evaluated by nerve
conduction velocity, sensory action potentials, motor
action potentials, SSR amplitude, NDS, NIS-LL, and
quantitative sensory testing for characterizing small-fiber
(coolness and heat detection) and large-fiber (vibratory de￾tection) peripheral sensory thresholds. Autonomic function
is assessed by heart rate deep breathing measures. Other
means of assessing the progression of TTR-FAP include
echocardiography, Holter monitoring, ophthalmologic
testing, mBMI measurement, and electrophysiologic evalu￾ation. Measurements should be made every 6 months.
Laboratory examinations for evaluating TTR-FAP
progression include measuring cardiac (plasma BNP,
NT-proBNP, and high-sensitivity serum troponin con￾centration) and renal (creatinine clearance and albu￾minuria) parameters.
Scoring systems
Several scoring systems for evaluating TTR-FAP have
been proposed from various clinical centers (Appendix
C). These include systems based on the stages of periph￾eral and autonomic neuropathies proposed by Coutinho
et al. [55], disease staging based on PND score, the
Portuguese classification to evaluate the severity of
TTR-FAP [56], sensory impairment scoring, autonomic
dysfunction scoring, and scoring of motor function for
muscle weakness.
Disease-modifying treatments for ttr-fap
Current treatment options for patients with TTR amyl￾oidosis are limited. For patients with TTR-FAP who have
mild or moderate disease and a diagnosis confirmed by
genetic testing and biopsy, liver transplant is the current
standard of care. However, symptomatic treatment to
provide immediate relief is a priority (Table 2). Since
variant TTR is produced largely in the liver, trans￾planting a new liver should almost completely eliminate
production of the variant protein and halt disease pro￾gression outside the brain and eyes. However, liver
transplant does not effectively prevent cardiomyopathy
in most cases and is not recommended for patients with
late-stage TTR-FAP or with leptomeningeal-type amyl￾oidosis. For these patients, symptomatic relief is the only
treatment strategy at present. The first pharmacologic
agent for patients with TTR-FAP was approved in
Europe in late 2011, and several other agents are in
various stages of clinical development. These pharma￾cotherapies are described in more detail below.
Liver transplant
Orthotopic liver transplant is the only disease-modifying
treatment available to patients with TTR-FAP. This
removes roughly 95% of the production of variant TTR
and can slow or halt the progression of the disease. In
most countries liver transplant is performed using organs
from deceased donors, but in Japan liver tissue from live
donors is used more frequently. Liver transplants for the
treatment of TTR-FAP are reported by participating
centers to the Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy World
Transplant Registry (FAPWTR, Appendix A).
Nerve function rarely improves after successful liver trans￾plantation; however, a lessening of autonomic disturbances
may occur. It is generally agreed that the best outcomes
achieved with liver transplant occur when the procedure is
performed in young patients whose disease has not be￾come advanced. Notably, some patients do not per￾ceive an improvement in their quality of life (QOL)
although their disease progression has been halted and
survival improved.
To be eligible for liver transplant, a patient should
have genetic proof of TTR-FAP, biopsy proof of amyloid
Ando et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2013, 8:31 Page 7 of 18
http://www.ojrd.com/content/8/1/31

deposits, and symptoms of early-stage TTR-FAP. Liver
transplantation in later stages (e.g. PND stage II or III;
see Appendix C) may be complicated by progressive
amyloid cardiomyopathy or neuropathy, prompting
many amyloid experts to recommend liver transplant
only in patients with early disease.
Outcomes of liver transplant for patients with TTR-FAP
Many patients have benefitted from liver transplant and
are able to live relatively normal lives, although the organ
impairment that occurred before the transplant does not
usually reverse. Long-term observations of transplanted
patients have clearly shown the histopathologic regression
of amyloid deposits [54] with an overall patient survival
rate at 5 years of >77% [57]. Current data from the
FAPWTR indicate a 10-year survival rate of 74% for
Val30Met versus 44% for non-Val30Met patients, empha￾sizing mutation-specific utility of liver transplantation in
TTR-FAP [57]. In addition, some patients continue to
demonstrate disease progression following liver transplant.
Mounting evidence indicates that TTR-FAP patients with
significant amyloid infiltration of the heart or nerves at
the time of liver transplantation may experience progres￾sion of disease postoperatively due to wild-type TTR de￾position on existing amyloid of variant TTR [58]. In
addition to the risks of surgery, transplanted patients also
need to remain on immunosuppressants for the rest of
their lives.
Prognosis after liver transplant is influenced by many
factors, including the properties of particular TTR
variants, nutritional status, age, and severity of neur￾opathy and cardiac amyloid involvement. Studies of sur￾vival as well as physical and mental improvement after
transplant are still needed, especially for patients with a
non-Val30Met mutation.
Domino liver transplant (DLT)
The cornerstone of transplantation is organ availability.
Despite advances in this field, a significant proportion of
patients with liver failure may die without a chance at
liver replacement. Because liver involvement in TTR￾FAP is minimal, the liver of an affected individual can be
grafted into selected patients (without TTR-FAP) who
meet the criteria for transplant but for whom the
current allocation schemes for cadaveric organs may not
allow transplant within a reasonable time. This proced￾ure has been termed DLT. Since 1995, more than 950
DLTs have been performed worldwide [59]. The assump￾tion was that amyloidosis would not appear for several
decades after liver transplant because patients rarely be￾come symptomatic before the age of 20 years and most
often not until their forties or fifties [60]. However, de
novo systemic amyloidosis after DLT was found to ap￾pear in a small number of patients earlier than initially
expected, and a number of DLT recipients have since
been retransplanted due to the transmission of TTR￾FAP through a domino graft 8 to 10 years after the
initial transplant [61]. Also, subclinical cutaneous TTR
deposits were reported in five other recipients of DLT
grafts [61,62]. Despite this, the donor shortage still justi￾fies DLT in selected patients. Post-transplant surveil￾lance for amyloid disease requires tissue biopsy and
electromyography in combination with observation
for clinical manifestations. Recipients of DLTs need
to be monitored for signs of de novo amyloid disease
after transplant. DLTs are also reported to the
FAPWTR, within the Domino Liver Transplant Registry
(Appendix A).
Combined heart and liver transplant
Cardiac risks and complications constitute major adverse
events in patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplant
for TTR-FAP. Cardiovascular complications account for
about 39% of deaths following liver transplant, almost
half of which occur within the first 3 months [57,63].
Moreover, cardiac disease may progress even after suc￾cessful liver transplant, especially in patients with
mutations other than Val30Met, due to the deposition of
wild-type TTR fibrils on preexisting amyloid matrix. In
highly selected patients these considerations may pro￾vide a rationale for the extremely challenging procedure
of combined heart and liver transplant [60]. The main
indication for this procedure is severe heart failure due
to amyloidotic cardiomyopathy in a patient without

advanced neurologic involvement. It has also been
proposed as a therapeutic option for patients affected by
mutations other than Val30Met who are candidates for
liver transplant and who have an echocardiographic
diagnosis of cardiomyopathy even in the absence of
major cardiovascular symptoms [41,60].
Pharmacotherapy
Elucidation of the mechanisms contributing to TTR
misfolding and fibril formation identified TTR-tetramer
stabilization as a rate-limiting event, leading to the de￾velopment of several new pharmacologic therapies for
patients with TTR-FAP. TTR stabilizing agents can be
prescribed at an early stage of disease in anticipation of
liver transplantation or, potentially, delaying the need for
liver transplant. Ongoing and recently completed clinical
trials investigating several pharmacotherapies are described
in Appendix D.
Tafamidis
Tafamidis (VyndaqelW; Pfizer Inc, New York, NY, USA)
is a disease-modifying agent that kinetically stabilizes
TTR [64]. It limits dissociation of the native TTR tetra￾mer into monomers, a critical step in fibril generation,
inhibiting TTR amyloid fibril formation. The pivotal
phase 2/3 trial showed that tafamidis was well-tolerated,
and although the coprimary efficacy endpoints (response
to treatment at Month 18 as measured by NIS-LL and
Norfolk Quality of Life–Diabetic Neuropathy total score)
were not met, the totality of the results suggested that
tafamidis could slow progression in patients with stage I
disease. Although the study only included patients aged
18 to 75 years, there is no age limit for initiating patients
on tafamidis. Data show that tafamidis is well tolerated
in patients with stage I disease, although gastrointestinal
side effects and urinary tract and vaginal infections may
occur. Tafamidis has orphan drug designation for TTR￾FAP in the United States and Europe. In 2011, the
European Medicines Agency approved tafamidis for use
in Europe for patients with early (stage I) Val30Met and
non-Val30Met TTR-FAP. The FDA has requested add￾itional clinical data through a second clinical trial before
considering approval in the United States. There are no
data supporting the treatment of patients with stage II
or III TTR-FAP or those who have familial amyloid
cardiomyopathy. Such patients should only receive
tafamidis within a clinical trial protocol.
Diflunisal
Diflunisal (DolobidW; Merck and Co, Inc, Whitehouse
Station, NJ, USA) is a commercially available non￾steroidal anti-inflammatory agent that stabilizes TTR
tetramers in vitro, preventing disaggregation, monomer
release, and amyloid fibril formation by misfolded TTR
monomers. A phase 1 study demonstrated that low
doses of diflunisal stabilized TTR tetramers with no
toxicities; and a phase 2/3 clinical trial involving 130
TTR-FAP patients will conclude in December 2012 [65].
The risks of gastrointestinal bleeding, altered renal func￾tion, or fluid retention may be low in a study population,
but patient selection and surveillance for adverse events
are important components of treatment.
ALN-TTR01 and ALN-TTR02
ALN-TTR01 and ALN-TTR02 (Alnylam Pharmaceuticals,
Inc, Cambridge, MA, USA) are systemically delivered
RNA interference therapeutics designed to suppress the
expression of TTR protein and prevent amyloid formation.
ALN-TTR01 employs a first-generation lipid nanoparticle
formulation. Studies of ALN-TTR01 in TTR-FAP trans￾genic mice have shown both prevention and regression of
pathogenic TTR deposits in peripheral tissues, while a sin￾gle dose results in rapid, dose-dependent, and sustained
reduction in serum TTR levels in patients with Val30Met
TTR-FAP. Recently, Alnylam announced results of a
phase 1 single-dose escalation trial of ALN-TTR02, a
second-generation lipid nanoparticle with >10-fold milli￾gram potency in suppressing serum TTR expression ver￾sus ALN-TTR01. Phase 2 studies are underway.
ISIS-TTRRx
ISIS-TTRRx (Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) is an antisense therapy that suppresses TTR
mRNA expression. A phase 1 study demonstrated a
dose-dependent reduction of TTR in healthy patients
with no reported significant adverse events [66]. A phase
2/3 study examining the effect of the anti-sense oligo￾nucleotide on disease progression and QOL in patients
with TTR-FAP is scheduled to begin in 2012.
Doxycycline/tauroursodeoxycholic acid (Doxy-TUDCA)
The combined use of doxycycline, an antibiotic that
disrupts TTR amyloid fibril formation, and TUDCA, a
drug used in patients with liver disorders that can re￾duce nonfibrillar TTR deposition, has demonstrated a
synergistic effect on lowering TTR deposits in mouse
models of TTR-FAP [67]. A phase 2 open-label trial
evaluating the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety, and tol￾erability of Doxy-TUDCA is ongoing [68].
Symptom management of ttr-fap
Staging overview (based on Coutinho [55])
Patients with stage 0 disease are asymptomatic but have
both a variant form of the TTR gene and evidence of
amyloid deposits. Patients with stage I (mild) disease are
ambulatory, patients with stage II (moderate) disease are
ambulatory but require assistance, and patients with
Ando et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2013, 8:31 Page 9 of 18
http://www.ojrd.com/content/8/1/31

stage III (severe) disease are bedridden or wheelchair￾bound.
Stage 0 disease
As disease onset is often late and diagnosis is difficult,
for many patients sometimes a definitive diagnosis is
made only in their sixties or seventies, although some
patients are diagnosed in their thirties or earlier. In some
countries, such as Portugal, patients tend to be young at
diagnosis, but in all cases these patients are likely to
have offspring or even grandchildren who may want to
be tested for TTR gene mutation. Offspring who are
positive for the mutated gene and test positive for amyl￾oid deposits are considered to have stage 0 disease.
Patients with stage 0 disease could be considered
candidates for pharmacotherapy, but because there are
no data to support the efficacy and safety of treatment
for such patients, they should be treated only within the
confines of a clinical trial.
Stage I disease
It is important to emphasize that, as with many diseases,
early detection is critical and can lead to the best
outcomes. From the outset, patients should be treated
symptomatically and stabilized (Table 2). Since the only
widely available, approved treatment for TTR-FAP is liver
transplant, all patients with stage I disease, irrespective of
mutation status or age, should be placed on a liver trans￾plant list. Early liver transplant is important, and younger
patients with mild symptoms are the best candidates.
Concurrently, patients should be treated with any
approved drugs as they become available and as the
patient’s disease state meets drug indications, independ￾ent of liver transplant plans. Small-molecule inhibitors,
such as tafamidis and diflunisal, may prolong the time
from disease onset to progression. Future studies will
determine whether one or both of these agents will have
durable inhibitory effects on TTR amyloidotic neur￾opathy and cardiomyopathy.
To be eligible for treatment, symptomatic patients
should have a confirmed diagnosis of TTR-FAP. Genetic
documentation as well as a positive amyloid biopsy
would be a sufficient confirmation of diagnosis. Patients
living in highly endemic areas of the world with a TTR
mutation and typical symptoms, depending on the
conventions of the medical community, may not require
a positive biopsy for treatment consideration (sites of
amyloid deposits can vary, so not all will be positive on
biopsy). However, if there is no biopsy evidence of amyl￾oid deposition, confounding diagnoses, such as pain due
to diabetic peripheral neuropathy, need to be excluded.
Patients who have been placed on pharmacotherapy
with objective evidence of disease progression should
pursue other treatment options such as liver transplant.
For patients exhibiting disease stabilization on pharma￾cotherapy, there is currently no consensus among
experts regarding the utility of liver transplant, as long￾term pharmacologic data are not available to address
treatment durability.
Follow-up assessments should be performed on an
average of every 6 months by an experienced physician
to identify disease progression. This is particularly
important for patients who have early and/or substantial
cardiac involvement. The actual battery of assessments
to follow patients should, at a minimum, mirror the
Transthyretin Amyloidosis Outcomes Survey (THAOS)
evaluation (full sensory and motor evaluation and echo￾cardiography) and include the NIS-LL (which can be
measured by nonexpert physicians), mBMI, and electro￾neuromyography.
Stage II disease
Data supporting the use of disease-modifying pharmaco￾therapy in patients with stage II disease are not available
at this time. Market approval for tafamidis in Europe is
limited to patients with stage I disease. Patients with
early stage II disease may also be considered for liver
transplant. Whether TTR-stabilizing pharmacotherapy
will prove effective in slowing or stopping disease pro￾gression in patients with stage II disease requires further
clinical study. These patients, as well as patients with
stage II disease who demonstrate cardiac involvement,
should receive disease-modifying pharmacotherapy only
within the confines of a clinical trial.
Stage III disease
While it is theoretically possible that the pharmacologic
treatment of patients who have stage III disease might
prolong or improve their QOL, no data are available
to support this. Such patients should receive disease￾modifying pharmacotherapy only within the confines of
a clinical trial.
Liver transplant recipients
The pharmacologic treatment of liver transplant recipients
may be appropriate, but currently there are no data avail￾able to support the use of disease-modifying therapies in
these patients. A phase 2 study of combined doxycycline/
TUDCA for the treatment of patients with TTR amyloid￾osis includes liver transplant recipients (Appendix D).
DLT recipients
Although a rationale exists for treating DLT recipients
with pharmacotherapy, no data are available to support
this practice. Drug treatments should not be considered
without evidence of amyloid deposition (e.g. biopsy
proof ). At present, DLT recipients should be treated
only in a clinical trial.
Ando et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2013, 8:31 Page 10 of 18
http://www.ojrd.com/content/8/1/31

Patient support
All efforts should be made to identify TTR-FAP early.
Once patients have developed stage I disease they should
be treated symptomatically regardless of disease presen￾tation. The goal is to alleviate symptoms and subsequently
establish a long-term strategy. Tafamidis, diflunisal, or any
other treatments shown to be efficacious should be started
at once. Until more data are available, patients with later￾stage disease should be treated only within clinical trials.
The questions of early prophylaxis and posttransplant ad￾ministration have yet to be formally addressed but offer
rich possibilities for further research.
For patients requiring liver transplant, local regulations
covering eligibility for transplant vary widely, with age
limits in some countries among other restrictions.
Physicians should discuss all possible options with their
patients. It is not clear whether guidelines for transplant
will change once new medications are approved.
TTR-FAP is extremely difficult to manage; thus, patients
and their families need all the social and moral support
possible. It is important to stress that the physician
involved should be a specialist in peripheral nerve disease
and be experienced in alleviating the symptoms associated
with neuropathies. Some countries will have specific
centers of excellence, but this is not the case everywhere.
Genetically related family members
Genetic testing should be performed on relatives of
patients with TTR-FAP when they are capable of
comprehending the medical, social, and psychological
ramifications of a positive result. Relatives should be
strongly encouraged to undergo genetic testing and, if
positive, tissue biopsies. Treatment options can then be
considered. However, for some individuals, including
those with a family history of late-onset disease, early gen￾etic testing may produce severe anxiety to which the phys￾ician needs to be sensitive. In all cases, genetic counseling
and, if necessary, psychological support should be offered
to affected family members. In some countries long-term
insurance eligibility is affected by genetic disease and
should be considered before DNA analysis.
Disease registries
Physicians are encouraged to enter their patients into the
appropriate registry or registries. These registries act as
valuable resources for disease awareness (for both the
public and the provider), inform clinical practice habits,
and identify gaps in knowledge. Information on enroll￾ment can be found on the websites listed in Appendix A.
THAOS (Transthyretin Amyloidosis Outcomes Survey)
THAOS, an international, longitudinal, observational
survey, developed by FoldRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc, (and
now supported by Pfizer Inc) in collaboration with
clinical disease experts, is designed to characterize the
variability, progression, and natural history of TTR
amyloidosis, as well as regional differences in disease
expression and the genotypic/phenotypic relationship in
TTR amyloidosis. This ongoing survey seeks to gather
information on patients diagnosed with TTR amyloidosis
to better understand this rare disease. As of March
2012, a total of 1224 individuals (657 male and 567
female) had enrolled at 46 sites in 19 countries. Of these,
1111 individuals had TTR mutations, of whom 834 had
the Val30Met mutation and 781 were symptomatic.
FAPWTR
The FAPWTR monitors the history of patients with TTR￾FAP who had undergone liver transplant. As of December
31, 2011, a total of 1985 liver transplant recipients were
recorded in the FAPWTR, including 37 combined heart￾liver transplants. Currently 73 centers perform liver trans￾plant in 19 countries [59]. The objectives of the FAPWTR
are to promote the collaboration and exchange of expe￾rience, monitor international transplant activity, help
optimize patient selection and ensure adequate follow-up
after transplant, and function as an investigative tool for
reporting centers.
Domino liver transplant registry
The Domino Liver Transplant Registry documents pa￾tients who have received a liver from a patient affected
with amyloidosis. Originally it was believed that symptoms
would take decades to develop, but recently some patients
have become diseased much sooner.
Conclusion
TTR amyloidosis is a progressive and fatal disease that is
increasingly diagnosed worldwide. Previously, liver trans￾plant was the only available treatment for patients with
TTR-FAP; the approval of tafamidis in 2011 for use in
Europe in patients with stage I TTR-FAP has broadened
therapeutic options.
The most reliable diagnostic approach involves genetic
testing followed by a tissue biopsy to confirm active
amyloid formation. Common symptoms also exist for
which there are assessment and scoring tools that are
important for documenting disease progression. Most
importantly, patients should be treated symptomatically
regardless of presentation and, if possible, stabilized,
since the immediate goal is to alleviate symptoms.
Physicians should also probe for certain autonomic
symptoms, such as irritable bowel syndrome and erectile
dysfunction, which may not always be revealed on a
standard examination. Such symptoms can then be
addressed. All patients with early-stage disease should
be evaluated for liver transplant and concurrently
considered for drug treatment. Patients with later-stage
Ando et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2013, 8:31 Page 11 of 18
http://www.ojrd.com/content/8/1/31

disease or cardiomyopathy have not yet been shown to
benefit from pharmacotherapy. The decision to remain
on the transplant list, if improvement is seen with drug
treatment, depends on local rules and on each individual
case. To help make this decision, physicians should moni￾tor their patients every 6 months with full sensory and
motor evaluation, echocardiography, NDS, and mBMI.
Many questions remain, including how to treat asymp￾tomatic patients with the TTR-FAP Val30Met mutation
and patients with stage 0 disease who have documented
amyloid, as there are no data to support prophylactic
treatment. In addition, there are no recommendations
regarding pharmacotherapy for liver transplant or DLT
recipients. Current and upcoming clinical trials will pro￾vide a basis for the proper administration of new drug
treatments and improved guidance for the use of cur￾rently available agents.

Recommended studies for TTR amyloidosis patients with
cardiomyopathy
ECG and echocardiographic examinations
The preliminary workup for a patient with suspected
cardiac amyloidosis includes 12-lead ECG and two￾dimensional echocardiography. Echocardiography pro￾vides the mainstay for the noninvasive diagnosis of
amyloidotic cardiomyopathy. A key point is to consider
not only LV wall thickness but other findings that could
suggest cardiac infiltration. Based on a study of patients
with a definite diagnosis of AL amyloidosis, Gertz et al.
[69] suggested a composite echocardiographic approach
based on the presence of end-diastolic thickness of the
interventricular septum >1.2 cm (in the absence of any
other cause of ventricular hypertrophy) plus two or all
of the following: homogeneous AV valve thickening,
atrial septum thickening, and sparkling/granular appear￾ance of the ventricular septum. This has also proved
to be valid for assessing other etiologic forms of
amyloidotic cardiomyopathy [70]. Pericardial effusion is
another frequent finding in cardiac amyloidosis.
The combination of pericardial effusion and increased
ventricular wall thickness should prompt a strong suspi￾cion of amyloidotic cardiomyopathy. In such cases, the
ventricles are usually not dilated and LV ejection fraction
tends to be normal or only slightly reduced, but the wall￾thickening velocity is frequently depressed [71]. Similarly,
the long-axis function of the left ventricle is often reduced
even in the early stages of the disease when radial frac￾tional shortening is still conserved [72,73].
Disease profile and instrumental features (as well as
clinical outcome) are related to the specific etiologic
form of cardiac amyloidosis, and profound differences
exist among the three most frequent pathogenic types of
amyloidotic cardiomyopathy (AL, wild-type, and mutant
TTR amyloidosis). In a large series of patients with
amyloidotic cardiomyopathy, the mean value of wall
thickness was, on average, lower in patients with AL
than in patients with hereditary TTR or senile systemic
amyloidosis, although the overlapping distributions seem
to preclude the use of this measure for differential diag￾nosis [70]. Conversely, echocardiographic features sug￾gestive of amyloidotic involvement commonly appear
only in the later stages of the disease [38,72]. Thus,
echocardiographic images cannot be used in isolation
for diagnostic confirmation and must be interpreted
in the context of the clinical picture and other
examinations. Perhaps the single most useful sign is the
presence of low or normal QRS voltage despite increased
LV wall thickness. Unfortunately, this highly specific sign
Ando et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2013, 8:31 Page 12 of 18
http://www.ojrd.com/content/8/1/31

is not very sensitive, and the prevalence of low QRS volt￾age (QRS voltage amplitude ≤0.5 mV in all limb leads or
≤1 mV in all precordial leads) usually is significantly
lower in patients with TTR amyloidosis than in patients
with AL [70]. This observation underscores the import￾ance of pursuing any clinical suspicion of TTR amyloi￾dotic cardiomyopathy, even in the absence of reduced
QRS voltage.
Other common ECG abnormalities include repola￾rization alterations; anterior, inferior, or lateral pseu￾doinfarct patterns; left anterior hemiblock; bundle branch
block; ischemic-type or nonspecific T-wave abnormalities
[74,75], and rhythm disturbances (e.g. atrial fibrillation). A
low-voltage ECG with increased septal and posterior
LV wall thickness on echocardiography is specific for car￾diac amyloidosis on noninvasive testing [74,75].
MRI
MRI with delayed gadolinium enhancement has proved
very useful for the detection of amyloid protein in the
myocardial interstitium. Since gadolinium tends to accu￾mulate within the interstitium infiltrated by amyloid,
in the presence of amyloidotic cardiomyopathy MRI
provides two highly specific findings: alterations in gado￾linium kinetics, with a faster-than-normal washout of
gadolinium from the blood and myocardium, and a late
enhancement effect, often with a predominant diffuse,
global, and subendocardial distribution [76], although in
some cases accumulation of amyloid in the myocardial
interstitium may appear more focal with variable trans￾mural extension [77].
Current MRI studies collectively describe patients with
different types of systemic amyloidosis, including TTR
amyloidosis, who exhibit previous diagnostic signs com￾mon to all types of amyloidosis. Therefore, it is unknown
whether MRI has the capability to distinguish between
amyloid types.
Scintigraphy
Myocardial amyloid involvement can be visualized by
several scintigraphic tracers, each of which binds to dis￾tinct parts of amyloid fibrils [78]. 123I-labeled serum
amyloid P (SAP) protein binds in a calcium-dependent
way to all amyloid deposits, irrespective of the protein of
origin. SAP scintigraphy (which is available only in a
few highly specialized centers) provides a reliable
semiquantitative evaluation of the extent and distribu￾tion of amyloid deposits in the soft tissues and visceral
organs, but not specifically in the heart [79-81]. 99mTc-aprotinin, a protease inhibitor, is able to detect
extra-abdominal amyloid deposits, such as cardiac
deposits, thanks to the physiologic uptake of the tracer
in the liver, spleen, and kidneys [82,83]. However, avail￾able experience is limited and quantitative assessment is
not feasible [79,82-84]. One tracer that has been used
for detecting cardiac amyloid deposition is 123I-meta￾iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG). Although 123I-MIBG does
not bind directly to amyloid deposits, 123I-MIBG scintig￾raphy has proven useful in the functional evaluation of
amyloid cardiomyopathy because it indirectly reveals the
impairment of cardiac sympathetic nerve endings due to
amyloid deposition [79,85,86]. There is increasing evi￾dence that 99mTc-DPD scintigraphy can image amyloid
deposition in the myocardium with a greater sensitivity
among patients with TTR-related cardiac amyloidosis
(both mutant and wild-type) than immunoglobulin
AL-related amyloidosis, and that, compared with a small
series of normal controls, it is a highly specific imaging
tool that can facilitate the differential diagnosis between
TTR and AL cardiac amyloidosis in routine practice
[47,87].

Clinical trials
Tafamidis
The efficacy and safety of tafamidis were evaluated in a
phase 2/3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
clinical trial (Fx-005) in which patients received oral
tafamidis 20 mg once daily (n = 65) or placebo (n = 63)
for 18 months [88]. Co-primary end points were NIS-LL
response to treatment (<2 point increase from baseline)
at 18 months and change from baseline to 18 months in
QOL as measured by a modified Norfolk Quality of
Life–Diabetic Neuropathy (total QOL; TQOL) score.
The intent-to-treat (ITT) population included all
randomized patients who received ≥1 dose of study
medication and had ≥1 post-baseline assessment for
each primary end point, or who discontinued due to
death or liver transplant. In this ITT population, while
statistical significance was not reached for either of these
endpoints, patients treated with tafamidis overall
experienced numerically less disease progression and
less worsening of quality of life than did patients treated
with placebo. In the pre-specified efficacy evaluable
population analysis at 18 months, the results showed a
significantly greater percentage of patients in the
tafamidis group with no disease progression based on
the NIS-LL responder analysis when compared with the
placebo group, while the tafamidis group demonstrated
significantly less worsening in quality of life than the
placebo group.
Tafamidis appeared to be safe and well tolerated;
treatment-related adverse events included diarrhea,
upper abdominal pain, urinary tract infection, and vagi￾nal infection. An open-label extension study (n = 86)
was conducted to evaluate long-term safety and efficacy
[89]. Slowing of disease progression was observed in
patients treated for either 30 or 18 months with
tafamidis (i.e. the tafamidis-tafamidis and placebo￾tafamidis cohorts, respectively), although earlier initi￾ation of treatment was associated with better outcomes,
including less neurologic deterioration and preserved
nutritional status and QOL. No new safety concerns
(as compared with the pivotal study) were observed over
30 months, and no patients discontinued treatment due
to adverse events.
Two additional phase 2, open-label safety and efficacy
studies of oral tafamidis 20 mg once daily in patients
with non-Val30Met TTR amyloidosis have been
completed, with results expected to be published in late
2012. In the polyneuropathy study, 21 patients with
non-Val30Met TTR-FAP received tafamidis for 12
months, with TTR stabilization at week 6 compared with
Ando et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2013, 8:31 Page 14 of 18
http://www.ojrd.com/content/8/1/31

baseline as the primary outcome measure. Secondary
outcome measures included the incidence of treatment￾emergent adverse events and change from baseline in
NIS and NIS-LL, nerve conduction studies, mBMI,
TQOL, and NT-proBNP and troponin I cardiac bio￾markers. Data suggest that non-Val30Met patients
treated with tafamidis experience slower neurologic pro￾gression (NIS-LL) and sustained quality of life (TQOL)
and nutritional status (mBMI) as compared with the
placebo-treated Val30Met patients in the pivotal trial
[90]. In the infiltrative cardiomyopathy study, 35 patients
with wild-type or Val122Ile TTR amyloidosis with car￾diomyopathy also received tafamidis once daily for 12
months, with TTR stabilization at week 6 compared with
baseline as the primary end point, and secondary out￾come measures, including incidence of treatment￾emergent adverse events and change from baseline in
echocardiography, cardiac MRI, chest x-ray, and Holter
monitoring parameters, NT-proBNP, troponin I and
T cardiac biomarkers, 6-minute walk test (6MWT), and
health-related QOL measures. Compared with non￾randomized, historical controls, patients receiving
tafamidis treatment experienced smaller changes from
baseline in NT-proBNP and 6MWT measures and a
lower incidence of cardiovascular hospitalization/death
at 12 months, although the differences were statistically
insignificant [91]. Although patients in both studies were
older and more severely affected compared with the
Val30Met patients in the blinded study, tafamidis was
effective in achieving and maintaining TTR tetramer
stabilization, and no new safety concerns related to drug
therapy were observed.
Diflunisal
A phase 2/3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
multinational clinical trial is currently under way evaluating
the use of diflunisal 250 mg twice daily for preventing the
progression of lower-limb nerve damage in patients with
TTR-FAP. The primary end point is the Neurologic Impair￾ment Score+7 (NIS+7) measured at 12 and 24 months.
Secondary end points include the Kumamoto neuro￾logic scale score, echocardiographic signs of cardiomyop￾athy, mBMI, amyloid deposition, and QOL. The study is
scheduled to be completed at the end of 2012, with results
announced in early 2013. Preliminary data indicate that
diflunisal is well tolerated in the study population. An
open-label extension study based in Sweden to observe
the long-term effects (over the course of about 2 years)
of diflunisal on neurologic and cardiac deterioration
and nutritional status is currently recruiting patients.
An open-label study in a single center in Japan (Shinshu
University) reported significant stabilization of disease
course [92].
ALN-TTR01 and ALN-TTR02
A phase 1, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-dose
escalation study of ALN-TTR01 in up to 36 patients
with TTR amyloidosis is near completion with results
expected later in 2012. Preliminary results from a phase
1 trial of ALN-TTR02 indicate an up to 94% reduction
of serum TTR levels and nearly 80% suppression after
one month following a single dose, which was safe and
well tolerated. An open-label phase 2 trial is currently
underway.
Doxycycline/TUDCA
A 12-month, phase 2, open-label study to evaluate the
pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety, and tolerability of
combined doxycycline/TUDCA treatment for TTR amyl￾oidosis is ongoing. Twenty patients with both variant and
wild-type TTR were enrolled, including three who had
undergone liver transplants 8 to 15 years before initiation
of the study. The primary end point was response rate to
treatment (non-progression of neuropathy or cardiomyop￾athy), with responders defined as patients with mBMI
reductions of <10% and NIS-LL changes of <2 points (in
patients with TTR-FAP) or NT-proBNP concentration
increases of <30% or <300 pg mL–1 (in patients with
isolated cardiomyopathy). Secondary outcomes included
pharmacokinetics, treatment-related adverse events, and
change in QOL and neurologic assessments. Preliminary
data suggest that the combined treatment can stabilize the
disease and has an acceptable toxicity profile.
