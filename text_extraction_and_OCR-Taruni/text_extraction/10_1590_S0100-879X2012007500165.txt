Abstract
Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) may represent a potential noninvasive molecular biomarker for various pathological condi￾tions. Moreover, the detection of circulating miRNAs can provide important novel disease-related information. In particular, 
inflammation-associated miR-155 and endothelial-enriched miR-126 are reported to be associated with vascular homeostasis. 
Vascular damage is a common event described in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). We hypothesized that miR-155 and miR-126 
may be detectable in the circulation and serve as potential biomarkers for risk stratification. In this study, we assessed miR-155 
and miR-126 in the plasma of 30 ESRD patients and 20 healthy controls using real-time quantification RT-PCR. The circulating 
levels of miR-155 and miR-126 were significantly reduced in patients with ESRD compared to healthy controls. However, there 
was no significant difference of circulating miR-155 and miR-126 levels between prehemodialysis and posthemodialysis patients. 
Furthermore, both circulating miR-126 and miR-155 correlated positively with estimated glomerular filtration rate (miR-126: r 
= 0.383, P = 0.037; miR-155: r = 0.494, P = 0.006) and hemoglobin (miR-126: r = 0.515, P = 0.004; miR-155: r = 0.598, P < 
0.001) and correlated inversely with phosphate level (miR-126: r = -0.675, P < 0.001; miR-155: r = -0.399, P = 0.029). Pearson’s 
correlation was used to compare circulating levels of miRNAs with clinical parameters. These results suggested that circulating 
miR-155 and miR-126 might be involved in the development of ESRD. Further studies are needed to demonstrate the role of 
circulating miR-155 and miR-126 as candidate biomarkers for risk estimation.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small (~22 nucle￾otides) non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression 
at the post-transcriptional level by either translational 
repression or messenger RNA degradation (1). MiRNAs 
have been shown to play critical roles in various cellular 
processes, inflammation, and angiogenesis (2). In particu￾lar, miR-126 and miR-155 have been reported to control 
vascular homeostasis, angiogenesis, and vascular repair. 
In addition, miR-155, an important multifunctional miRNA, 
has been shown to regulate the endothelial inflammatory 
response and migration mediated by angiotensin α (3). 
Moreover, accumulating evidence points to an essential 
role of miRNAs in kidney disease, which is supported by 
the finding that the depletion of the miRNA-processing en￾zyme Dicer results in defects in renin cells (juxtaglomerular 
cells), angiogenesis, and renal morphological integrity and 
function (4-6). Specific miRNA expression profiles have 
been described for diabetic nephropathy, polycystic kidney 
disease and kidney allograft rejection (7). 
Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of 
morbidity and mortality in patients with end-stage renal 
disease (ESRD) (8), and this cardiovascular risk cannot 
be completely elucidated by traditional risk factors. Thus, 
more emphasis has been placed on non-traditional risk 
factors such as vascular calcification, inflammation, en￾dothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress, and sympathetic 
overactivation (9,10). A few specific miRNAs have been 
implicated in the functional regulation of endothelial cells 
(ECs), as well as inflammatory responses and peripheral 
angiogenic signaling (11). Thus, differentially expressed 
miRNAs are responsible for non-traditional risk factors of 
chronic kidney disease (CKD). Given that miR-126 and 

Circulating miR-155 and miR-126 in ESRD 1309
www.bjournal.com.br Braz J Med Biol Res 45(12) 2012
miR-155 play important roles in EC functional regulation, 
endothelial dysfunction has been reported to be associ￾ated with ESRD. Therefore, we hypothesized that miR-126 
and miR-155 may be involved in vascular damage-related 
pathophysiology in patients with ESRD. 
MiRNAs were previously considered to act as intracel￾lular RNAs to regulate gene expression. However, increas￾ing evidence suggested that miRNAs can be detected in 
the circulation in remarkably stable form that withstands 
repeated freezing/thawing cycles (12). It was discovered 
that miRNAs circulate within membrane-bound vesicles 
that are resistant to RNase digestion (13). One study 
additionally demonstrated that circulating Argonaute 2 
complexes, carrying a number of miRNAs independent of 
vesicles, are one mechanism responsible for the stability of 
circulating miRNAs (14). Similarly, it has been recognized 
that specific miRNAs could serve as potential biomarkers 
of various diseases in the circulation. Therefore, in the 
present study, we assayed the circulating levels of in￾flammation-associated miR-155 and endothelial-enriched 
miR-126 in patients with ESRD, expecting to be able to 
provide new insights into the development of ESRD and 
the manifestation of its vascular complications.
Material and Methods 
Patients and volunteers
The study included ESRD patients of ≥18 years of age 
who had been receiving maintenance hemodialysis 3 times 
weekly for at least 3 months. The primary disease in ESRD 
patients was chronic glomerulonephritis in China, which 
was proved by biopsy. Twenty healthy adults without any 
evidence of CKD or inflammatory disorders were included 
in the control group. All participating subjects gave writ￾ten informed consent before participating in the study. 
All study protocols and consent forms were approved by 
the Second Clinical Medical College (Shenzhen People’s 
Hospital) of Jinan University, which abides by the Helsinki 
Declaration on ethical principles for medical research 
involving human subjects.
Blood processing 
In the pre-hemodialysis (pre-HD) patients, whole blood 
samples (3 mL) were collected immediately pre-HD from 
fistula needles before machine connection or any heparin 
exposure. In the post-hemodialysis (post-HD) patients, 
samples were also collected from fistula needles. All blood 
samples were processed for the isolation of plasma within 
4 h of collection. The blood was centrifuged at 2000 g for 
10 min at room temperature. Plasma was then transferred 
to RNase-free tubes and stored at -80°C.
RNA isolation
RNA was isolated by using a Trizol-based miRNA 
isolation protocol in which 300 µL plasma was mixed with 
1200 µL Trizol (Invitrogen, USA). After the addition of 
Trizol, we supplemented the plasma with 2 µL synthetic 
cel-lin-4 (Shanghai GenePharma, China) and subse￾quently mixed it with 200 µL chloroform. The organic 
and aqueous phase was separated by centrifugation. 
The aqueous phase containing the RNA was carefully 
removed, and RNA was precipitated as described previ￾ously (15,16). RNA was solubilized by the addition of 25 
μL RNase-free water.
Real-time quantification RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) of 
mature miRNAs
To determine the regulation of miRNAs, we per￾formed RT-qPCR using RNA isolated from 20 healthy 
controls and 30 pre-HD and post-HD patients. Target￾specific stem-loop RT primers that bind to the 3′ portion 
of miRNA molecules were used and reverse transcription 
was performed using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase 
(Promega, USA). Real-time PCR was then performed 
using an ABI PRISM 7500 Sequence Detection System 
(Applied Biosystems, USA) with miRNA-specific forward 
and reverse primers. Each SYBR Green reaction was 
performed with 5 μL template cDNA, 10 μL 2X SYBR 
Greens PCR Master Mix (Toyobo, Japan), 0.5 μL of 
each primer (10 μmol/μL), and water to adjust to a final 
volume of 20 μL. 
The miRNA-specific forward primer sequences were 
designed based on the mature miRNA sequence ob￾tained from the miRBase database (http://www.mirbase.
org/). The RT primers used include 1) RT forward: hsa￾miR-126, 5′-ACACTCCAGCTGGGTCGTACCGTGAGT 
AATAA-3′; hsa-miR-155, 5′-ACACTCCAGCTGGGTT 
AATGCTAATCGTGATA-3′; cel-lin-4, 5′-ACACTCCAG 
CTGGGTCCCTGAGACCTCAAGTG-3′, and 2) miRNA 
reverse: 5′-CTCAACTGGTGTCGTGGA-3′. All reactions 
were incubated on a 96-well plate at 95°C for 5 min, fol￾lowed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 65°C for 15 s, 72°C 
for 32 s. Each sample was assayed in triplicate for the 
analysis. Finally, at the end of the PCR cycles, melting 
curves were constructed to confirm the specificity of the 
expected PCR products. 
Statistical analysis
All data for continuous variables are reported as means 
± SD, unless otherwise stated. Values were normalized 
to cel-lin-4 and were calculated according to the 2-∆∆CT
method, as described previously (17). For group-wise 
comparisons, the Student t-test (2 groups), ANOVA, or 
Kruskal-Wallis test (n group) were used, as appropriate. 
The Pearson product-moment test was used to examine 
the correlations between miRNA levels and clinical pa￾rameters. All statistical tests were performed 2-sided and 
the level of significance was set at P < 0.05. All statistical 
analyses were carried out using the SPSS (version 13.0) 
software.

Results
A total of 50 subjects were studied, including 30 ESRD 
patients and 20 healthy controls. There was no difference 
in age between ESRD patients and healthy controls (P > 
0.05). The clinical characteristics of the study population 
are summarized in Table 1. 
Expression of miRNAs in plasma 
To date, no reliable endogenous control miRNA has been 
established and validated to normalize for miRNA content. 
The use of synthetic versions of Caenorhabditis elegans
miRNAs as controls has been proposed by many investiga￾tors (15). Therefore, we supplemented the samples 
with recombinant cel-lin-4, which can be consistently 
detected by RT-qPCR, and no significant difference 
in raw Ct values of cel-lin-4 was detected among 
the 3 groups (P = 0.754; Kruskal-Wallis test). Thus, 
cel-lin-4 was used to normalize the differences in 
the efficiency of RNA isolation. 
As shown in Figure 1, the circulating levels of 
miR-126 and miR-155 were significantly different 
when ESRD patients were compared to healthy 
controls. The circulating levels of miR-126 and miR￾155 were significantly reduced in pre-HD patients 
compared to healthy controls. However, no sig￾nificant internal correlation was observed between 
the circulating levels of miR-126 and miR-155 (r 
= -0.179, P = 0.450). Interestingly, the circulating 
levels of miR-126 and miR-155 were still significantly 
reduced in post-HD patients compared to healthy 
controls (miR-126: P < 0.001; miR-155: P < 0.001). 
Remarkably, no significant difference was observed 
between pre-HD and post-HD patients (P > 0.05).
Correlations between miRNA level and clinical 
parameters
The relative expression levels of circulating miRNAs 
were calculated by the comparative 2-ΔΔCT method. Figure 2 
shows that the circulating levels of miR-126 correlated posi￾tively with both estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 
(r = 0.383, P= 0.037) and hemoglobin (r = 0.515, P= 0.004). 
However, they correlated negatively with phosphate level 
(r = -0.675, P < 0.001) and were not significantly correlated 
with C-reactive protein (CRP) (r = -0.234, P = 0.214). As 
shown in Figure 3, the circulating miR-155 levels correlated 
positively with both eGFR (r = 0.494, P = 0.006) and he￾moglobin (r = 0.598, P < 0.001), but correlated negatively

with phosphate levels (r = -0.399, P = 0.029) and CRP (r 
= -0.379, P = 0.039). In addition, the circulating levels of 
miR-126 and miR-155 were not significantly correlated with 
calcium or albumin levels.
Discussion
We showed here that the circulating levels of endothe￾lial-enriched and inflammation-associated miRNAs were 
significantly dysregulated in patients with ESRD receiving 
maintenance hemodialysis compared to healthy controls; 
moreover, the levels of these miRNAs tended to be signifi￾cantly reduced in patients with ESRD. Our findings warrant 
prospective investigation into the role of circulating miRNAs 
in the pathophysiology and cardiovascular complications 
of ESRD.
MiR-126 and miR-155 in ESRD 
It is important to realize that endothelial dysregulation 
starts in the early stage of CKD (18) and is a common 
event identified in both chronic and acute renal failure 
and in ESRD (9). In addition, studies have suggested that 
inflammation exists in patients with ESRD and might be 
aggravated by hemodialysis (19). Similarly, recent stud￾ies have demonstrated that miRNA can regulate vascular 
inflammation, endothelial homeostasis, and angiogenesis. 
In particular, miR-126 and miR-155 have been shown to be 
involved in vascular dysfunction and inflammation. MiR-126 
is highly enriched in ECs and endothelial apoptotic bodies 
and governs the maintenance of vascular integrity and 
angiogenesis (20,21). Moreover, miR-126 can facilitate 
vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway (11) 
and modify vascular inflammation by suppressing leuko￾cyte adhesion to ECs. MiR-155 regulates the expression 
of adhesion molecules in inflammatory ECs as well as 
inflammation response in ECs mediated by and angio￾tensin α (22). Another study revealed that miR-155 and 
angiotensin α type 1 receptor (AT1R) are co-expressed 
in ECs and vascular smooth-muscle cells (23) and their 
expression is negatively correlated with the expression of 
the endogenous AT1R (24). A silent polymorphism (+1166 
A/C) in the human AT1R has been shown to be associated 
with cardiovascular disease (CVD), which might be medi￾ated by enhanced AT1R activity (23). Therefore, miR-126 
and miR-155 might be responsible for endothelial activation 
and increased CVD risk in ESRD patients (25).
Circulating miR-155 and miR-126 in ESRD patients
Recent studies have revealed that miRNAs previously 
identified in specific cells can also be detected in the cir￾culation. Neal et al. (26) have shown that circulating levels 
of total and specific miRNAs were reduced in patients with 
severe chronic renal failure, with important implications for 
the use of circulating miRNAs as biomarkers in patients 
with renal impairment and for the pathogenesis of uremia. 
Moreover, Amabile et al. (27) suggested that miR-210 might 
serve as a strong and independent predictor of survival in 
critically ill patients with acute kidney injury. In the present 
study, we measured the expression of miR-155 and miR￾126, which were significantly reduced in ESRD patients. Our 
data suggested that miR-126 and miR-155 might be useful 
predictive tools in ESRD; however, these results should be 
validated in a large clinical population, in which comparisons 
with standard risk factors could be made.
Although the origin of miRNAs present in the circulation 
is incompletely understood, it is possible that circulating 
miRNAs are derived from vascular and inflammatory cells 
in body fluids. For example, endothelial and inflammatory 
cells can be a source of circulating miR-126 and miR-155. 
Circulating miRNAs are packed within membrane-bound 
vesicles (14). These vesicles are byproducts released from 
cell apoptosis or activation, and are involved in cell-cell 
communication (28). However, the reduced concentration of 
circulating miR-126 and miR-155 detected in patients with 
ESRD was surprising because one would expect that ECs 
and the inflammatory cell activation that occurs in ESRD 
contribute to the release of microparticles and remnants of 
apoptotic cells, thus increasing the expressed levels of circu￾lating miRNAs. However, Neal et al. (26) demonstrated that 
the rate of miRNA degradation is increased in plasma from 
patients with severe CKD. Therefore, one may speculate 
that the reduced circulating miR-126 and miR-155 might 
be associated with the increased miRNA degradation rate 
in patients with ESRD. 
Additionally, accumulating evidence suggests that apop￾totic bodies and microparticles can be transferred to other 
cell types (29), and that low circulating levels might result 
from increased delivery of miR-126 and miR-155 to recipient 
cell, and then act as physiologically functional molecules to 
exert gene silencing through the same mechanism as cel￾lular miRNAs, suggesting the potentially important roles of 
circulating miRNAs in the development of CKD. Therefore, 
it is at least theoretically probable that circulating miR-126 
and miR-155 are involved in the development of ESRD. 
Moreover, in the present study, we observed that 
the circulating levels of miR-126 and miR-155 were also 
significantly reduced in post-HD patients, but did not sig￾nificantly differ between pre-HD and post-HD, suggesting 
that the slight changes of plasma miR-155 and miR-126 
between pre-HD and post-HD might be associated with the 
responsiveness to hemodialysis, or heparin anticoagulation 
may potentially interfere with the RT-qPCR-based assay. 
Nevertheless, further studies are required for the validation 
and extension of these results. We also found that circulat￾ing miR-155 and miR-126 levels correlated positively with 
eGFR and hemoglobin but were inversely correlated with 
phosphate levels. This finding suggested that the reduction 
of circulating miR-126 and miR-155 might be accompanied 
by a series of clinical symptoms. Although preliminary, our 
results showed that the two miRNAs can be considered as 

Circulating miR-155 and miR-126 in ESRD 1313
www.bjournal.com.br Braz J Med Biol Res 45(12) 2012
candidate peripheral markers that may enable the prediction 
of ESRD progression.
Our study specifically addressed the levels and regu￾lation of inflammation-associated and endothelial-derived 
miRNAs. Although altered levels of miR-126 and miR-155 in 
patients with ESRD did not significantly differ between pre￾HD and post-HD patients, miR-126 and miR-155 deserve 
special consideration as novel biomarkers for risk estimation 
and classification. Meanwhile, we need to validate these 
data in large clinical populations. Furthermore, the effect of 
drug treatment on circulating miR-126 and miR-155 levels 
remains to be studied. However, the findings of the current 
study do allow us to propose that circulating miR-126 and 
miR-155 levels may be of clinical importance in ESRD.
