The current epidemic of diabetes with its overwhelming burden on our healthcare system requires better thera￾peutic strategies. Here we present a promising novel approach for a curative strategy that may be accessible 
for all insulin-dependent diabetes patients. We designed a subcutaneous implantable bioartificial pancreas 
(BAP)—the “b-Air”—that is able to overcome critical challenges in current clinical islet transplantation pro￾tocols: adequate oxygen supply to the graft and protection of donor islets against the host immune system. The 
system consists of islets of Langerhans immobilized in an alginate hydrogel, a gas chamber, a gas permeable 
membrane, an external membrane, and a mechanical support. The minimally invasive implantable device, 
refueled with oxygen via subdermally implanted access ports, completely normalized diabetic indicators of 
glycemic control (blood glucose intravenous glucose tolerance test and HbA1c) in streptozotocin-induced dia￾betic rats for periods up to 6 months. The functionality of the device was dependent on oxygen supply to the 
device as the grafts failed when oxygen supply was ceased. In addition, we showed that the device is immuno￾protective as it allowed for survival of not only isografts but also of allografts. Histological examination of 
the explanted devices demonstrated morphologically and functionally intact islets; the surrounding tissue was 
without signs of inflammation and showed visual evidence of vasculature at the site of implantation. Further 
increase in islets loading density will justify the translation of the system to clinical trials, opening up the poten￾tial for a novel approach in diabetes therapy.

INTRODUCTION
A major goal in the treatment of insulin-dependent dia￾betes is to improve the patient’s quality of life by providing 
the patient with an insulin source that regulates the glucose 
levels on a mandatory minute-to-minute basis. Presently, 
this can be achieved only following transplantation of 
donor pancreatic islets (32). Many efforts have been made 
to make islet transplantation a widely applicable proce￾dure to cure diabetes (10). Unfortunately, in recent years, 
many obstacles that prevent islet transplantation from 
being an acceptable alternative for insulin therapy have 
been identified. The first is the requirement for more than 
one donor per recipient (34). This is a major drawback in a 
world of severe shortage of donor organs. Second, immu￾nological and morbidity issues have been described (10). 
Furthermore, the procedure may not allow retransplanta￾tion as recipients may develop allotype immunization (9), 
which may obstruct future transplantations in the same 
patient, and, last but certainly not least, islet allotransplan￾tation requires lifelong use of immunosuppressive therapy. 

1464 Barkai ET AL.
Thus, islet transplantation is currently not considered an 
acceptable alternative for insulin therapy.
All the aforementioned issues could be solved with 
immunoisolation of pancreatic islets. Immunoisolation 
does not require the use of immunosuppressive agents and, 
theoretically, allows for transplantation of islets from non￾human sources, thereby solving the donor shortage prob￾lem. The principle applicability of immunoisolation was 
previously shown in experimental systems (1,12,14,24) 
and in pilot clinical trials (17). However, encapsulated 
islets have a limited graft survival time that has been attrib￾uted to lack of sufficient supply of oxygen (13,21). 
A mathematical model developed by Dulong and 
Legallaise (15) clearly predicts the physiological limi￾tations of encapsulated islets when transplanted into 
a site with venous-type oxygen tension. Essentially, 
inadequate oxygen supply caused loss of islet viability 
and reduced their capacity to secrete insulin (13,21). 
These effects are exacerbated in encapsulated islets 
(2,3,11,16,27,28). Several solutions have been proposed 
to generate oxygen close to the capsules or to reduce 
transport limitations imposed by the encapsulation sys￾tem. Some experimentally tested systems include direct 
supply of oxygen to cultured cells by means of elec￾trochemical generator (39) or to isolated islets by local 
photosynthesis (6). Unfortunately, these systems cannot 
generate the amount of oxygen required to maintain the 
viability of islets in clinical doses. Other approaches to 
increase oxygen supply and graft survival include induc￾ing angiogenesis around the devices (26), the application 
of islet cell clusters of small diameter to reduce diffu￾sional distance to the islet’s core cells (20,25,30), use of 
hypoxia-resistant islet cells (38), and the use of islet cells 
engineered to contain intracellular oxygen carrier such 
as myoglobin (35). Notably, none of these approaches 
attempted to increase oxygen supply by active means. 
An approach utilizing active supply of oxygen has been 
the focus of our research efforts in recent years; such 
an approach not only enhances the in vivo survival 
rates of islets in the current devices implanted in the 
subcutis but may also facilitate increasing the islet dose 
in the devices. 
In this study, we investigated a comprehensive approach 
that allows for active oxygen supply to the islets in an 
immunoisolating device. It involves an immune barrier, an 
adequate oxygen supply, and a minimally invasive surgical 
procedure.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals, Diabetes Induction, and Pretreatment
All experiments were approved by the Israeli National 
Ethical Committee. Lewis and Sprague–Dawley rats were 
purchased from Harlan (Rehovot, Israel). Diabetes was 
induced in Lewis rats (260–280 g) by a single intravenous 
infusion of 85 mg/kg body weight of streptozotocin (STZ; 
Sigma, Rehovot, Israel). This treatment induced irrevers￾ible diabetes (nonfasting blood glucose >450 mg/dl) in 
>90% of rats in our colony. In addition, levels of c-peptide, 
measured from serum samples by ELISA (Alpco Diag￾nostics, Salem, NH, USA), in induced animals (n=6) were 
under detection limits 30 min after receiving a glucose 
(Sigma) bolus of 0.5 g/kg body weight (data not shown). 
Animals were considered diabetic when nonfasting blood 
glucose exceeded 450 mg/dl for ≥4 consecutive days. To 
prepare the diabetic animals for device implantation in a 
nonstressing, close-to-normal blood glucose environment, 
1.5 capsules of slow released insulin (Linplant, LinShin, 
Toronto, ON, Canada) were inserted under the skin of 
the diabetic animals and removed 48 h after implantation 
(so the device would become the only source for insulin). 
Animals were considered ready for implantation when 
their nonfasted blood glucose was <250 mg/dl for ≥3 con￾secutive days. Efficacy of glycemic control was followed 
for 30–180 days postimplantation. The functionality of the 
device was assessed by three different diagnostic tests: 
daily measurements of nonfasting blood glucose, intrave￾nous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTT) performed at 3, 9, 
and 12 weeks postimplantation, and the level of glycosy￾lated hemoglobin (HbA1c) determined at day 90 postim￾plantation. To avoid false-positive results associated with 
regeneration of the native pancreas, blood glucose was fol￾lowed for a period of time after the removal of the device. 
Islet Isolation, Cultivation, and Enumeration
Pancreata were obtained from 9- to 10-week-old male 
Lewis or Sprague–Dawley rats weighing 260–280 and 
300–320 g, respectively. Standard collagenase digestion 
of the donor pancreata was used with some modifica￾tions. Briefly, each pancreas was infused with10 ml enzy￾matic digestive blend containing 15 PZ units collagenase 
NB8 (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) and 1mg/ml bovine 
DNAse (Sigma, cat. no. 159001) in Hank’s balanced salt 
solution (HBSS; Biological Industries, Bet HaEmek, 
Israel) for 14 min. Islets were purified on discontinuous 
Histopaque gradient [1.119/ 1.100/1.077/ RPMI (Sigma)] 
run for 20 min at 1750 g/max in the cold (6°C). They were 
then washed twice and cultured in complete CR medium 
[Connaught Medical Research Laboratories (CMRL): 
Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium (1:1) 
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (all from 
Biological Industries)] for a period of 5–8 days before 
being integrated into the implantable devices. 
For determining number of cells in a rat islet equiva￾lent (IEQ), we selected 21 different lots containing 50–60 
standard islets each. Islets were defined as “standard” 
when diameters of both x- and y-axes were estimated 

IMPROVED VIABILITY OF A NEW BIOARTIFICIAL PANCREAS 1465
to be 150 µm. For enumeration of cells, the method of 
Pisania et al. (33) was used and a value of 1,556±145 
cells/IEQ was obtained. Immediately after isolation, rat 
islets were subjected to the same enumeration protocol 
and found to contain 1,430 ± 185 cells/islet (n = 10). At 
the time of device assembly (6–8 days after isolation), we 
enumerated 1,270±280 cells/IEQ (n=107). During the 
cultivation period, cell count in an average islet declined 
by <20%, and therefore, at time of implantation, an islet 
particle was estimated to correspond to 0.8 IEQ.
Islet particles were either isogeneic (i.e., derived from 
Lewis rats and implanted into diabetic Lewis rats) or 
allogeneic (i.e., derived from Sprague–Dawley rats and 
implanted into diabetic Lewis rats). 
Oxygen Consumption Rate 
Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of naked islets 
was determined with samples of 250 IEQ suspended 
in RPMI:CMRL (1:1) and supplemented with 1% fetal 
bovine serum. Measurements were carried inside a 620-µl 
chamber equipped with stir bar and placed in a tempera￾ture control unit (Eurotherm 808; Eurotherm, Worthing, 
UK) kept at constant temperature of 37°C. OCR of pre￾implanted, encapsulated islets was similarly determined 
with samples of 250 IEQ immobilized in 30 µl of ultra￾pure, high guluronic acid (68%) alginate (UP-MVG, 
Novamatrix). OCR of postimplanted islets was deter￾mined following explantation of the device, release of the 
alginate slab, and manual counting of islets using doses 
of ≥200 islets. Oxygen concentration in the gas cham￾ber of the device was determined by injecting a sample 
taken from the interior of the gas chamber into the oxy￾gen measurement cell in a gas phase, into which a Clark￾type oxygen electrode (Unisense, Arhaus, Denmark) was 
inserted. Oxygen partial pressure in liquids and gases was 
measured using a Unisense oxygen measurement system 
including a micromanipulator, Clark-type microelectrode, 
and PA2000 picoammeter controller (Unisense). Data 
were analyzed using Labview 7.2 software (National 
Instruments, Austin, TX, USA). OCR of naked islets 
was calculated as previously described (31). OCR of the 
device was calculated from the change in oxygen concen￾tration in a gas chamber of known volume 24 h after refu￾eling with a known oxygen concentration. The decrease 
in oxygen concentration was compared to the total OCR 
of the islets during the 24 h (see below).
Subkidney Capsule Transplantation
Doses of 900 IEQ of either isogeneic (Lewis) or allo￾geneic (Sprague–Dawley) rat islets were used for these 
experiments. Islets were separated from the tissue culture 
medium by low force (140´g) centrifugation and con￾centrated to a volume of 5 µl. For naked islet transplanta￾tion, a 3-mm incision was made in the kidney capsule 
and the entire dose of islets was infused into the formed 
pouch. For implantation of encapsulated islets, 40 µl of 
2.2% (w/v) high mannuronic acid (M = 54%) alginate 
(UP-MVM, Novamatrix, Sandvika, Norway) was mixed 
with the islet pellet and poured into a stainless steel mold 
(diameter, 9 mm; width, 0.5 mm; generated in house 
from 316 stainless steel) at density of 1,400 IEQ/cm2
 in 
face surface area. In order to obtain homogeneous cross 
linking of the hydrogel polymer, the mold containing the 
islet-alginate suspension was covered with a sintered 
glass disc (Robu Glas 1530, Robu Galsfilter Gerate, 
Hattert, Germany) presoaked with the cross-linking solu￾tion [70 mM SrCl2 (Sigma); 20 mM NaCl (Sigma), 20 mM
HEPES pH 7.4 (Biological Industries); 270 mOsm]
for 12 min. A 9-mm incision was made in the kidney cap￾sule, separated from the kidney cortex, and the slab was 
inserted into the formed pouch using watchmaker for￾ceps (Bochem Instrumente GmbH, Weilburg, Germany). 
Two identical slabs were implanted, one underneath 
each kidney capsule. 
Implantable Devices 
The bioartificial pancreas (BAP) prototypes (Fig. 1A) 
are subcutaneously implanted disc-shaped devices con￾sisting of two major components—an islet module con￾taining islets encapsulated in an alginate hydrogel slab, 
which is separated from the implantation pocket, and a 
gas chamber, which is separated from the islet module. 
The housing of the device is made of clinical grade 
polyether ether ketone (PEEK Optima LT1R40; Invibio, 
Thornton Cleveleys, Lancashire, UK). Two BAP proto￾types were investigated, designated “b-Air” I and II. The 
two prototypes have identical external diameters and 
materials of construction and were loaded with the same 
islet dose. They differ in the surface area of the islet￾containing slab, the method of gas chamber ventilation, 
and the composition of the infused gas mixture. Surface 
density of the islets in “b-Air II” is more than twice that 
of “b-Air I.” Also, “b-Air I” uses a continuous supply 
of atmospheric air whereas oxygen-enriched gas mixture 
(40% oxygen and 5% CO2
) is injected once a day into 
the gas chamber of the “b-Air II” prototype (see below 
for details).
The exterior diameter and height of “b-Air I” (Fig. 1B) 
is 31.3 and 7 mm, respectively. The gas chamber (vol￾ume, 3 ml) is connected to an external air pump and an 
outlet port by two transcutaneous silicone tubes (1 mm 
OD; Chen Shmuel Chemicals, Haifa, Israel). The internal 
islet module (diameter, 18 mm; surface area, 2.54 cm2
; 
height, 0.5 mm) contains 2,500 donor IEQ embedded in 
ultrapure, high guluronic acid (68%) alginate. 
A custom-fabricated 25-µm-thick Silon IPN (interpen￾etrating network of polydimethylsiloxane and polyethe￾fluoroethylene) oxygen-permeable membrane (Bio Med 

1466 Barkai ET AL.
Sciences, Allentown, PA, USA) separates the gas cham￾ber from the islet module and a 25-µm hydrophylized 
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane (“Biopore”; 
Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany) with a pore size of 
0.4 µm creates a barrier between the islet module and the 
recipient’s tissue. A metal grid on each side of the islet 
module provides mechanical strength. The oxygen perme￾ability of the silon IPN membrane, measured in a diffusion 
apparatus at 37°C, is 4.36´10-14 mol/(s´cm2´mmHg).
The outer dimensions of “b-Air II” are identical to those 
of “b-Air I”; however, the diameter of the islet module in 
“b-Air II” is reduced to 11.5 mm (net surface area, 1.05 cm2
) 
to enable testing of a larger islet density (Fig. 1C). As such, 
the surface density of the encapsulated islets is increased 
from about 1,000 IEQ/cm2
 in the “b-Air I” device to >2,000 
IEQ/cm2
 in the “b-Air II.” The device is connected to two 
implanted subcutaneous access ports (Soloport; Instech 
Solomon, San Antonio, TX, USA) placed on the dorsal 
side of the animal between the scapula by short polyure￾thane tubes (part of the port kit) (Fig. 2A). The foot￾print of the oxygen delivery system is seen on a shaved 
animal shown in Figure 2B. 
Device Assembly
Doses of 2,200–2,600 IEQ were collected by brief cen￾trifugation (140 ´ g). Each pellet was gently mixed with 
1.8% (w/v) of high guluronic acid alginate (G=0.68) and 
transferred to a sterile mold (diameter, 10.6 or 18 mm; 
thickness, 0.5 mm). Alginate was cross-linked by the 
slightly hypotonic strontium cross-linking solution men￾tioned above. Thereafter, the islet-containing slab (Fig. 
3A, B) was released from the mold and washed twice at 
37°C in complete CR medium for 5 min each. The slab 
was then installed into an islet module and a Biopore mem￾brane was fixed onto the device using a Viton75/27 mm 
O-ring (McMaster Carr, Los Angeles, CA, USA). The 
membrane was sealed to the plastic housing with Med 
1000 silicone glue (Nusil, Carpinteria, CA, USA). Fully 
fabricated devices (Fig. 3C, D) were washed in complete 
CR medium in 37°C for 2 h before implantation. 
Device Implantation
Rats were anesthetized by ketamin/xylazin (Vetoquinol, 
Lure Cedex, France) followed by isofluran (Abbott 
Laboratories Ltd., Maidenhead, Berkshire, UK) inhalation. 
A 3-cm incision was made on the dorsal skin, and muscles 
were separated from the hypodermis. A second incision 
was made in the skin between the shoulder blades, and two 
channels, connecting this site with the device implantation 
site, were created by traversing 3-mm-wide stainless steel 
needles (made in house) under the skin. Two silicon tubes, 
part of the gas infusion system of the “b-Air I” device, were 
threaded via these channels to connect the device with an 
external gas supply. The body of the device was inserted

under the dorsal skin incision with the islet module fac￾ing the fascia and skin was sutured and fixed with a tissue 
adhesive (Histoacryl B Braun, Tufflingen, Germany). The 
outlet of the silicone tubes were inserted into a restrain￾ing system (CIH95 Covance Infusion Harness; Instech 
Laboratories, Plymouth, PA, USA) and connected to 
an external air pump (Fig. 2A). In “b-Air II,” the tubes 
(made of polyurethane) and the dedicated subcutaneous 
access ports were both implanted under the skin at a place 
remote from the device. An oxygen-enriched gas mixture 
was infused daily into the gas chamber through this relay 
mechanism (Fig. 2B).
Gas Ventilation
For the “b-Air I” device, filtered atmospheric air from 
a compressed tank with pressure-reducing valve, was 
infused for a period of 15 min at a rate of 5 ml/min every 
2 h through one of the silicone rubber tubes. The tubes 
remained open to the external air for the rest of the time. 
Gas chambers of “b-Air II” devices were replenished 
daily by flushing a gas mixture through the integral sub￾cutaneous access ports (Fig. 2B). In initial tests using gas 
mixture containing either 20% or 30% oxygen, the islet 
grafts failed to function within a short period of time or 
displayed improper glycemic control. Subsequently, fur￾ther refueling of the gas chamber was carried out with gas 
mixtures containing 40% oxygen, 55% nitrogen, and 5% 
CO2
. The CO2
 helped to maintain physiological pH in the 
islets module. 
Functional End Points
Nonfasting blood glucose concentration was measured 
twice daily in whole blood with a portable glucometer 
(Acu-Check; Hoffmann La Roche, Basel, Switzerland). 
For IVGTT, dextrose solution (Cure Medical, Emek 
Hefer Industrial Park, Israel) at a dose of 0.5 g/kg body 
weight was infused during a 15-s period via the penile 
vein following an overnight fast. Blood glucose was mea￾sured before infusion and at 10, 30, 60, 120, and 180 min 
postinfusion. HbA1c was determined by a service pro￾vider using dried blood samples on filter paper (Flexsite 
Inc. Services, Palm City, FL, USA).
Histology and Immunohistochemistry
At the end of the planned implantation period, grafts 
were retrieved for histological examination. Tissues were 
dehydrated with an automated device (Tissue-Tek VIP6 
Sakura; Finetek, CA, USA), embedded in paraffin, and 
sectioned at approximately 4–5 µm. For toluidene blue 
staining, sections were deparaffinized in xylene (Sigma), 
rehydrated in distilled water, and incubated in 0.1% tolui￾dine blue (Sigma) in 1% NaCl for 1 min. Stained slides 
were washed, dehydrated, cleared in xylene, mounted, 
and covered. For glucagon and insulin immunostaining, 
slides were incubated overnight at 60°C, deparaffinized, 
and rehydrated in tap water. Slides were then boiled in 
acidic citrate solution (Invitrogen, Camarillo, CA, USA), 
blocked for 15 min with CAS block (Invitrogen), and incu￾bated with mouse anti-human insulin antibody (Biogenex,

(ab18461; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) diluted 1:100. Slides 
were rewashed, incubated with Super Picture Ploy HRP 
conjugate reagent (Invitrogen) for 15 min, color devel￾oped with DAB substrate solution (Invitrogen) followed 
by a 8-min wash in running tap water. All slides were 
counterstained in Mayer’s hematoxylin (Sigma), dehy￾drated, cleared in xylene, mounted, and covered. For 
Ki67 immunostaining, slides were incubated overnight at 
64°C, deparaffinized, and rehydrated in tap water. Slides 
were then boiled in basic nuclear decloaker solution (Bio￾care Medical, Concord, CA, USA), blocked for 10 min
with CAS block, and incubated with rabbit monoclonal 
anti-human Ki67 antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 
Loughborough, Leicestershire, UK) diluted 1:200 for 1 h 
at room temperature. Slides were rewashed, incubated 
with Super Picture Poly HRP conjugate reagent for 15 min, 
color developed with DAB substrate solution followed by 
a 8-min wash in running tap water. Slides were counter￾stained in Mayer’s hematoxylene, dehydrated, cleared in 
xylene, mounted, and covered. For SMA staining, mono￾clonal anti-a-smooth muscle actin (SMA; clone 1A4; 
Sigma product A2547) was used according to the manu￾facturer’s instructions.
RESULTS
Enhanced Oxygen Supply Facilitates Islet Survival 
in a Subcutaneous Implant
Our initial objective was to determine whether ade￾quate oxygen supply facilitates islet survival in our BAP 
devices by first establishing that, without oxygen, the 
islets in our devices fail after a short period of time. To 
this end, we normalized blood glucose levels of four dia￾betic rats using slow-release insulin capsules, implanted 
one “b-Air II” device, (each containing ~2,300 isogeneic 
IEQ at a density of 2,250 IEQ/cm2
) in each rat, and then 
removed the insulin capsules without pumping oxygen 
into the gas chamber of the device at any time. Indeed, 
our analysis of nonfasting blood glucose levels over time 
(Fig. 4A) demonstrated that, following implantation, nor￾mal nonfasting blood glucose levels were sustained for 
a period of only 1–2 days, after which the graft failed, 
as indicated by the elevated levels of blood glucose. 
These findings are consistent with comparative analyses 
of the islet module. Following 9 days of implantation, 
nearly 50% of the original IEQ loaded into the device 
were recovered; however, <7% of the original total OCR 
and total insulin content were retained at the end of the 
implantation period (Table 1).
We then evaluated the ability of an oxygen-refueled 
“b-Air II” device to normalize blood glucose levels. To 
this end, we implanted “b-Air II” devices (each device 
contained ~2,400 isogeneic IEQ at a surface density of 
2,300 IEQ/cm2 and was refueled daily with gas blend 
containing 40% oxygen) into six diabetic rats (one 
device per recipient) and removed the slow release insu￾lin capsules. Our analysis of nonfasting blood glucose 
levels over time demonstrated that the devices restored 
normal nonfasting blood glucose levels for a period of 
58 days (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, upon stopping the oxy￾gen supply to the device (after 58 days), we observed 
an abrupt rise in nonfasting blood glucose, further con￾firming that the islets in our device could not survive 
in the subcutaneous environment without an exogenous 
supply of oxygen.

devices for a period of 9 days, but oxygen was not refueled at 
any time. Level of nonfasting blood glucose was monitored 
daily. (B) Six rats were made diabetic and blood glucose nor￾malized by a slow release insulin capsule. On day 0, the insulin 
capsules were removed and “b-Air II” devices were implanted 
for a period of 58 days. The gas chamber was refueled once 
a day. At the end of this period, oxygen supply to the devices 
was disabled. Blood glucose was followed for 5 additional days.

Functional Islets Are Maintained 
by Exogenous Oxygen Supply
Our subsequent objective was to characterize the 
functionality of our BAP devices. For this purpose, we 
implanted 17 diabetic Lewis rats with devices containing 
isogeneic donor islets (10 rats received “b-Air I” and 7 rats 
received “b-Air II” devices) for a period of 90 days. Mean 
values (±SD) of islet dose, total OCR at implantation time, 
and packing densities are summarized in Table 2.
Our analysis of nonfasting blood glucose levels over 
time (from the removal of the slow-release insulin capsule 
and device implantation) showed that normoglycemia 
was attained and maintained in both prototype devices 
throughout the entire implantation period and that device 
explantation was followed by a rapid blood glucose 
increase (Fig. 5), suggesting that effective grafts could be 
maintained at surface densities of 1,000 and 2,000 IEQ/
cm2
 once adequate oxygen is being supplied. Several ani￾mals were implanted for extended periods of time (up to 
250 days) with similar results (data not shown). 
The performance of the device was further character￾ized using a retrospective analysis of 107 implantation 
experiments, which demonstrated that total OCR of the 
implanted graft was a better correlate of device perfor￾mance (nonfasting blood glucose levels) at 1 month than 
the implanted IEQ or insulin dose (data not shown). 
Most of the Oxygen Supplied During Each Refueling 
Event Is Consumed by the Islets
Next, we wanted to explore the consumption of sup￾plied oxygen by the islets in our BAP device by studying 
the oxygen concentrations at the device gas chamber over 
time. To this end, we used seven animals implanted with 
“b-Air II” devices. Gas mixture containing 40% oxygen 
was flushed daily into the corresponding gas chambers 
and oxygen levels were recorded twice weekly before 
replenishment event was performed (i.e., when the oxy￾gen concentration was at its nadir). During the 90-day 
period of the experiment, the mean (±SD) of nonfasting 
blood glucose was 109±49.6 mg/dl.
At the end of a 24-h period between two refueling 
events, the average oxygen concentration in the gas cham￾bers decreased from a fixed level of 40% to 25.1±2.0% 
(n=145). For a 3-ml chamber, the corresponding oxygen 
disappearance rate was 19.9 ± 0.14 µmol/day. The islet 
grafts had a total OCR of 8,900±1,600 pmol/min (mea￾sured at time of implantation), corresponding to con￾sumption rates of 12.8±2.3 µmol/day. Thus, assuming a 
stable OCR over time, about 65% of the supplied oxygen 
was consumed by the islets. The remainder probably dif￾fused through the alginate matrix and the adjoining tubes 
into the tissue surrounding the implantation pocket.
Intravenous Glucose Tolerance Test Is Normalized 
by Implanted Devices
A subsequent objective was to further characterize the 
functionality of the “b-Air” device using an acute phase 
test. The question arisen was whether the semipermeable 
diffusion barrier between the implanted islets and the 
local vascular bed may create a delay in insulin response 
to a glucose challenge. To this end, we performed IVGTT 
assays in diabetic rats carrying implanted devices con￾taining isogeneic islets at 3, 9, and 12 weeks postimplan￾tation (Fig. 6). 
The response profiles of the implanted animals, con￾taining either device type, were similar to those of healthy 
rats and markedly different from those of diabetic rats 
(Fig. 6A, B). Although the areas under the curves (AUC, 
120-min period) of the implanted rats were increased 
compared with healthy rats (by 5–33%), this increase was

much smaller compared with the corresponding increase 
observed in diabetic rats (by >400%). Moreover, the 
AUC values of both device types at 3, 9, and 12 weeks 
postimplantation were statistically comparable (Fig. 6C). 
Combined, our findings suggest that the implanted devices 
normalized IVGTT findings in implanted animals. 
Implanted Devices Immunoprotect Allogeneic 
Islet Grafts
Next, we wanted to explore the ability of our device 
to immunoprotect allogeneic islet grafts. To this end, 
we first compared the ability of isogeneic and alloge￾neic islets to cure diabetes in a simple animal model. We 
normalized blood glucose of diabetic Lewis rats using 
slow release insulin capsule, transplanted either Lewis 
or Sprague–Dawley islets under the kidney capsule of 
four experimental groups (n=9), and removed the slow 
release insulin capsule. The transplanted islets included 
either naked islets (900 IEQ) or a similar dose of islets 
encapsulated in flat geometry high M alginate slabs. Our 
analysis of nonfasting blood glucose levels over time 
(Fig. 7) demonstrated that naked or encapsulated isoge￾neic islets were active throughout the entire experimental 
period, whereas allotype islets—either naked or encap￾sulated—were rejected within 10 days of implantation, 
as evidenced by the increase in blood glucose levels and 
microscopic examinations (data not shown). 
As a simple alginate hydrogel immune barrier failed 
to provide adequate protection to allogeneic transplanted 
islets, we explored whether the immunobarrier of our 
devices could do so by implanting seven diabetic Lewis 
rats with “b-Air II” devices containing Sprague–Dawley 
islets (IEQ, 2,130±60; 2,000 IEQ/cm2
). Our analysis of 
nonfasting blood glucose over time (Fig. 8A) demon￾strated that all the implanted animals achieved normogly￾cemia during the 90-day evaluation period and quickly 
reverted to the diabetic state upon device explantation 
(notably, in several animals an initial lag period that 
spanned the first 2 weeks was observed). 
To confirm and expand upon our findings, we per￾formed IVGTT assays on diabetic animals implanted with 
devices containing allotype islets (3, 9, and 12 weeks after 
implantation) (Fig. 8B, C). Our analysis demonstrated that 
the implanted devices were functional not only in preserv￾ing nonfasting blood glucose levels but also in controlling 
acute glucose load. Similar to our findings with devices 
containing isogeneic islets, AUCs (120-min period) of the 
implanted rats were increased compared with healthy rats 
(by 20–45%); however, this increase was much smaller 
than the corresponding increase observed with diabetic 
animals (~350%), and the integrated AUC levels at 3, 9, 
and 12 weeks postimplantation were statistically compa￾rable (Fig. 8C). 
Low Levels of HbA1c Are Observed in 
Experimental Rats With Implanted Devices
To further characterize the functionality of our devices 
(carrying either isogeneic or allogeneic islets), we evalu￾ated HbA1c levels in diabetic rats postimplantation 
[HbA1c is a surrogate measure of the time-averaged 
blood glucose concentration over the mean lifetime of red 
blood cells, which in rats is approximately 60 days (5)]. 
We determined the levels of serum HbA1c 90–120 days 
postimplantation of devices carrying either isogeneic 
(n=17) or allogeneic (n=13) islets (Fig. 9). Collectively, 
the implanted rats had slightly (albeit statistically signifi￾cant) elevated levels of HbA1c compared with healthy 
rats (increase of 21% and 33% relative to healthy rats for 
Figure 5. “b-Air” devices normalize blood glucose levels in 
diabetic rats throughout the implantation period. Diabetic rats 
were implanted with either “b-Air I” (A; n=10) or “b-Air II” 
(B; n=7) devices containing isogeneic islets. Nonfasting blood 
glucose concentrations were monitored twice daily. Devices 
were explanted after the 90-day implantation period and non￾fasting blood glucose was measured for 5 additional days. Gray 
and black lines represent 99% upper and lower 99% confidence 
limits of the averages, respectively.

the increase observed with diabetic rats (275% increase).
Biocompatibility, the Islet Module, and the Fibrotic 
Pocket of the BAP Devices Upon Explantation
Our last objective was to evaluate the biocompatibility 
of our BAP device. To this end, we explanted the devices 
after a period of 90–180 days, inspected them for tissue 
response and integrity of the islet module, and examined 
the fibrotic pocket enveloping the device for growth of vas￾cular bed. The implantation pocket of animals implanted 
with devices carrying either isogeneic or allogeneic islets 
appeared visually healthy and nonirritated with no signs of 
local inflammatory reaction (data not shown). The housing 
of the explanted devices was intact and the “Biopore” 
membrane was complete and undamaged.
We inspected the islet modules visually before separating 
them from the housing. They appeared intact and undam￾aged (Fig. 10A). Immunohistological examination of the 
islets within the module demonstrated that they contained 
functional islets as demonstrated by insulin and glucagon 
staining (Fig. 10B, C) and that they retained some prolifera￾tion capacity (demonstrated by Ki67 staining) (Fig. 10D).
Four fibrotic pockets surrounding explanted “b-Air II” 
devices were processed for histological and immunohis￾tochemical examinations. The pockets were comprised of 
band-like mature films measuring between 350 and 550 µm 
in thickness. On both faces of the device, networks of

“b-Air II” (B; n=7) devices equipped with isogeneic islets were 
fasted overnight. They were then intravenously infused with 
glucose (0.5 g/kg), and blood glucose was periodically sampled 
for 3 h. Dark green line, healthy rats; blue line, diabetic rats.

) on the side facing the active side 
of the device and 12±3.8 on the contralateral side (n=4 
animals; not a statistically significant difference). 
DISCUSSION
Widespread use of pancreatic islet transplantation 
is mainly limited by general shortage of donor organs, 
the need for more than one donor per recipient, and the 
necessity for lifelong use of immunosuppressants. In this 
study, we examined a mechanically stable, retrievable, 
implantable device design that facilitates a more efficient 
use of tissue by enhancing oxygen supply to the islets and 
achieving immunoisolation from the allogeneic immune 
response through the use of a physical immunobarrier. 
Additional characteristics of our device that may facili￾tate its clinical development include its biocompatibility 
and subcutaneous location. 
Visual and histological examination of the implantation 
pocket at time of device retrieval demonstrated physio￾logical responses involving the formation of an ordered 
fibrotic capsule around the device without an inflamma￾tory reaction. In addition, the fibrotic tissue surrounding the 
device exhibited vascular structures with densities compara￾ble to those recently reported by Veriter et al. (36). Notably, 
close proximity of blood vessels and the encapsulated 
islets create short diffusion distances for glucose and 
insulin and consequently a nearly normal IVGTT.
The advantages of the subcutaneous location of our 
BAP device (in contrast to current procedures in which 
islets are either infused into the portal system or trans￾planted into the peritoneal cavity) include implantation 
that requires a minimally invasive surgery, visualization 
during the implantation period, and easy device retrieval. 
However, since the subcutaneous space is characterized

Seven diabetic Lewis rats were made normoglycemic using

by low oxygen partial pressure and low vascularity, it may 
not be an appropriate transplantation site for high oxygen￾consuming islets, although some success has been reported 
using low oxygen consuming porcine islets (14).
Oxygen supply is essential for islet functionality as 
during isolation, islets are separated from their blood 
supply, the intraislet vascular network is lost, and islets 
become dependent on diffusion for oxygen supply. Islets 
exposed to hypoxia undergo hypoxia-mediated inflamma￾tory reactions, oxidative stress, and apoptosis (4,29,40). 
Encapsulation can exacerbate the oxygen supply prob￾lem, as has been demonstrated in detailed studies with 
mathematical models (15,20). Our data show that encap￾sulated islets at high surface density (1,400 IEQ/cm2
) 
survive for 1 month at a well-perfused environment like 
the subcapsular space of the kidney even if not actively 
supplied with oxygen. However, when implanted in the 
poorly oxygenated subcutis, encapsulated islets in the 
device become completely nonfunctional within a very short 
period of time if not supplied with exogenous oxygen. 
Our BAP device provides a unique solution for ade￾quate islet oxygenation. Gas-phase oxygen is contained in 
a chamber that is an integral part of the device, and the oxy￾gen diffuses across a thin gas-permeable membrane and 
through an adjacent alginate hydrogel to supply the islets. 
We observed that the functionality of donor islets integrated 
in devices at a density of ~1,000 IEQ/cm2
 (“b-Air I”) could 
be maintained with atmospheric air for periods as long as 
180 days until experiments were electively terminated. All 
glycemic indicators were corrected to normal values by the

“b-Air I” implanted devices and quickly returned to the 
diabetic state upon device explantation. At a higher islet 
density (>2,000 IEQ/cm2
), the islets could not be sustained 
by atmospheric air in the gas chamber, and therefore, we 
developed a different ventilation approach wherein a gas 
mixture containing 40% oxygen was infused daily through 
subcutaneous access ports into the gas chamber of the 
“b-Air II” device. Our data show that 24 h after refueling 
(i.e., immediately prior to the subsequent oxygen replen￾ishment), the oxygen in the chamber decreased consider￾ably suggesting that 60–75% of the originally contained 
oxygen was consumed by the graft. The remainder prob￾ably diffused into the surrounding host tissue without any 
observed toxicity. The oxygen partial pressures in the gas 
chamber ranged from 304 to 198 mmHg. For an average 
OCR (8,000 pmol/min/device), an area of 1.05 cm2
 (for the 
“b-Air II” device), and a 25-µm-thick Silon IPN membrane 
with permeability of 4.36´10-14 mol/(s´cm2´mmHg), 
the partial pressure drop across the membrane is calculated 
to be ~7 mmHg. Consequently, the islet cells close to the 
membrane are exposed to an oxygen level which is simi￾lar to that in the gas chamber. Although the partial pres￾sure drops as oxygen diffuses and is consumed within the 
500-µm thick islet module, a significant fraction of islet 
tissue is expected to be exposed to an oxygen partial pres￾sure, which is substantially greater than the 100 mmHg 
level typical of arterial blood. Nonetheless, oxygen toxic￾ity was not observed, and the performance of the graft, as 
measured by all glycemic indicators, was maintained for 
prolonged periods of time of up to 180 days. The efficacy 
of the encapsulated islet tissue in the device was further 
confirmed using immunohistochemical analyses, which 
demonstrated the presence of insulin-containing b-cells 
and cell proliferation in explanted grafts. Our observation is 
consistent with the findings of Lacy et al. (22) and Hughes 
et al. (19), both of whom demonstrated beneficial effects 
of high oxygen concentrations before and during implanta￾tion period on the performances of the transplanted grafts. 
After demonstrating the feasibility of transplanting high 
oxygen-consuming islet grafts in an otherwise oxygen-poor 
environment, we explored the immune protection of donor 
islets against the host immune system in an allogeneic trans￾plantation setting. We clearly showed that our BAP device 
immunoprotects the graft (at least for the timeframe of the 
experiments) against the host immune system as all glyc￾emic indicators of the implanted animals were normalized 
for long periods of time (up to 180 days) and no differences 
were observed between the functional capacities of isoge￾neic and allogeneic islets in these devices. In our system, 
such immunoprotection could not be provided when islets 
were encapsulated only in a simple slab of alginate hydro￾gel. The immune barrier established by our BAP device is 
based on a mechanical solution. Donor islets are contained 
in a housing fabricated mainly of PEEK impermeable 
plastic and are separated from the host immune system by 
a two-layer barrier (overlaying membrane and the alginate 
gel). This barrier is hypothesized to prevent physical con￾tact between the islets and any of the host immune cells, 
thereby inactivating the T-cell-mediated immune rejection 
and delaying inward diffusion of immunoglobulins. 
Control of blood glucose involves many players, of 
which insulin and glucagon play a key role. Insulin mono￾therapy for diabetes uses the most important player; still, 
glucagon is important to avoid hypoglycemia. Therefore, 
glucose homeostasis controlled by islets should provide 
a better solution than insulin therapy. However, intra￾hepatic transplanted islets contain fewer a-cells than 
normal islets (23) and glucagon expression in these islets 
decreases over time (18). Bohman’s observation that a￾cells are retained in encapsulated islets for a period of 
100 days (7) is confirmed in our experiments showing 
glucagon staining in islet-containing devices explanted 
after a period of 180 days. As such, an added benefit of 
our solution is that patients implanted with the “b-Air” 
device might experience a better glycemic control com￾pared with those transplanted with the currently available 
state-of-the-art therapy.
The physiologically efficient glucose metabolism is 
facilitated by the anatomy of the pancreas draining into 
the portal system, the cephalic and intestinal signals that 
enhance insulin release, and the highly permeable islet 
vascularity that facilitates rapid insulin and glucagon 
release. In contrast, the BAP device delivers insulin away 
from the liver and might present less efficient kinetics of 
insulin release. Consequently, the pharmacokinetic profile 
of blood glucose after meals might be expected to lead to 
longer periods with higher glucose levels and less efficient 
shutoff of insulin release resulting in later hypoglycemia. 
However, this hypothesis is not supported by our IVGTT 
findings in the implanted animals. The integrated AUC 
(120 min) of diabetic animals is increased by more than 
300% over the AUC of normal, healthy rats (52,700 vs. 
13,000). At the same time, AUC of diabetic rats implanted 
with either isogeneic or allogeneic islet grafts differed from 
that of healthy animals by a modest factor of 25% only. Two 
additional findings refute the “delayed device response” 
hypothesis. First, the 3-h time points of the IVGTT assays 
did not present any significant level of hypoglycaemia; and 
second, results of IVGTT assays performed 3 weeks post￾implantation did not differ from those of assays performed 
12 weeks postimplantation. Our observations support 
the notion that the kinetics of glucose intake and insulin 
release by the implanted devices is sufficiently rapid so as 
to nearly normalize IVGTT assays. This kinetics, in turn, 
might be explained by the observed vascularization of the 
fibrotic tissue encapsulating the device (a vascularization 
that may be induced by proangiogenic factors released 
from the islets) (8,36,37). 

IMPROVED VIABILITY OF A NEW BIOARTIFICIAL PANCREAS 1475
Assuming an islet surface density of ~2,000 IEQ/cm2
(the density of the “b-Air II” devices), a surface area of 
50 cm2 would be required for each 100,000 IEQ implanted. 
For humans (in whom a total of 300–500K IEQ is 
required), this density translates to a required surface area 
of 150–250 cm2
, which is probably clinically impractical, 
even if divided into multiple devices. Therefore, additional 
research focused on increasing islet density is needed. 
In summary, in this report, we present a comprehensive 
approach that addresses the critical issues of current islet 
transplantation in a single device and demonstrate the effi￾cacy of this approach in a small animal model of diabetes. 
A physical immune barrier, adequate oxygen supply, and 
minimally invasive surgical procedure are the hallmarks of 
this new approach.
