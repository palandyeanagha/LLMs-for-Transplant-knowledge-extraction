Nail-patella syndrome (NPS) is characterized by developmental defects of dorsal limb structures,
nephropathy, and glaucoma and is caused by heterozygous mutations in the LIM homeodomain
transcription factor LMX1B. In order to identify possible genotype–phenotype correlations, we performed
LMX1B mutation analysis and comprehensive investigations of limb, renal, ocular, and audiological
characteristics in 106 subjects from 32 NPS families. Remarkable phenotypic variability at the individual,
intrafamilial, and interfamilial level was observed for different NPS manifestations. Quantitative
urinanalysis revealed proteinuria in 21.3% of individuals. Microalbuminuria was detected in 21.7% of
subjects without overt proteinuria. Interestingly, nephropathy appeared significantly more frequent in
females. A significant association was established between the presence of clinically relevant renal
involvement in an NPS patient and a positive family history of nephropathy. We identified normal-tension
glaucoma (NTG) and sensorineural hearing impairment as new symptoms associated with NPS.
Sequencing of LMX1B revealed 18 different mutations, including six novel variants, in 28 families.
Individuals with an LMX1B mutation located in the homeodomain showed significantly more frequent and
higher values of proteinuria compared to subjects carrying mutations in the LIM domains. No clear
genotype –phenotype association was apparent for extrarenal manifestations. This is the first study
indicating that family history of nephropathy and mutation location might be important in precipitating
individual risks for developing NPS renal disease. We suggest that the NPS phenotype is broader than
previously described and that NTG and hearing impairment are part of NPS. Further studies on modifier
factors are needed to understand the mechanisms underlying phenotypic heterogeneity.

Introduction
Nail-patella syndrome (NPS; MIM 161200) is an autosomal
dominant disorder characterised by developmental defects
of dorsal limb structures, the kidney, and the eye, manifested
by nail dysplasia, patellar abnormalities, elbow dysplasia,
iliac horns, nephropathy, and glaucoma, respectively. NPS is
caused by heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding the
LIM-homeodomain transcription factor LMX1B.1,2 Studies
in Lmx1b/ mice have shown that Lmx1b plays a crucial
role in dorso-ventral patterning of the limb, patterning of
the skull, morphogenesis and function of the podocytes and
the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), and develop￾ment of the anterior segment of the eye.3–8 In the central
nervous system, Lmx1b is involved in developing dopami￾nergic and serotonergic neurons of the hindbrain and the
midbrain, and dorsal interneurons of the spinal cord.9 – 12
Nephropathy and glaucoma are the most relevant
clinical manifestations in human NPS.13,14 NPS nephro￾pathy is a disease of both the podocytes and the GBM, with
irregular thickening and electron lucent areas as consistent
ultrastructural hallmarks of the GBM.7,15,16 Interestingly,
abnormal collagen expression has been observed in human
NPS renal biopsy specimens15 and in Lmx1b/ murine
kidneys5 and corneal stroma.6 The molecular mechanisms
underlying the phenotypic aspects of this disorder, how￾ever, are as yet unclear. Recent studies, including an
excellent review by Sweeney et al,
17 have shown remark￾able phenotypic heterogeneity of NPS, but no statistical
analysis of the LMX1B genotype with respect to detailed
multidisciplinary clinical studies has been performed.
Here, we performed comprehensive clinical investiga￾tions and LMX1B mutation analysis in a large cohort of
NPS patients. The aim of the study was three-fold: (a) to
define the complete phenotype of NPS based on the
knowledge of the Lmx1b expression and function (Figure 1);
(b) to compare the presence and severity of renal and
extrarenal manifestations at the individual, intrafamilial,
and interfamilial level; and (c) to evaluate the NPS
characteristics in the view of the LMX1B genotype in order
to identify possible genotype –phenotype associations.
Patients and methods
Patients
The study population comprised 106 subjects with NPS, 50
males and 56 females. The total of 32 families included 96
individuals from 22 unrelated families and 10 sporadic
subjects. In total, 21 families were recruited from Human
Genetics Departments, five from Orthopaedic Surgery
Departments, one from a Paediatric Department, and two
from patient contact groups. Three families contacted us
through the media. The series of families included one of
the first NPS families (family 1) in which linkage of NPS to
the ABO blood group was shown in 195718 and a five

generation family (family 26) with high prevalence of
nephropathy originally described in 1988.19 The study was
approved by the local medical ethics committee and
written informed consent was obtained from all partici￾pants or their parents. All patients were examined at the
Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre.
Examination of limbs and pelvis
Radiographic series of both knees of individuals aged 46
years, included an antero-posterior view, a true lateral view,
and an axial view. For assessment of patellar aplasia or
hypoplasia in subjects aged r6 years, ultrasonography of both
knees was performed. A lateral view of the elbows and an
antero-posterior view of the pelvis were taken in all subjects.
To quantify the nail, patellar and elbow anomalies, iliac horns,
and additional major and minor orthopaedic manifestations
of NPS, the clinical scoring system developed by Farley et al20
was used. However, for objective determination of patellar
anomalies and iliac horns, the radiographic findings were
included instead of palpation. Major orthopaedic diagnoses
included club feet and/or hip dysplasia.20 Minor orthopaedic
findings comprised tendon contractures in hand and feet and/
or foot deformities.20 The severity score was categorised as
mild, moderate, or severe according to Farley et al.
20
Nephrological examination
Nephrological investigations could be performed in 81
patients from 27 families, 35 males and 46 females with a
mean age of 38.6 years (range 0.5 – 81.8 years) at the time of
examination. Blood pressures (BP) were measured in supine
position by Dynamap (Criticon, Tampa, FL, USA). The
determination of protein and albumin excretion and
microscopic examination of urine sediment were per￾formed in a random and a first morning urine specimen.
Serum creatinine, albumin, and cholesterol were measured
by standard chemical procedures. Proteinuria was defined
as total urinary protein 40.1 g/l accompanied by a
protein –creatinine ratio 40.2 g per 10 mM of creatinine.
Microalbuminuria was defined as an albumin –creatinine
ratio (ACR; mg of albumin per 10 mM of creatinine)
between 20 and 300 in males and between 30 and 300 in
females and macroalbuminuria as an ACR 4300. Hyper￾tension was defined as systolic BP Z140 mmHg and/or
diastolic BP Z90 mmHg for adults and age-related BP
reference values were used for children.21 Individuals using
antihypertensive therapy were also considered as being
hypertensive. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was esti￾mated by endogenous creatinine clearance (CrC), calcu￾lated by Cockcroft –Gault formula and adjusted for body
surface area.22,23 To investigate possible characteristics
related to the renal phenotype, individuals were sub￾divided according to the presence or absence of nephro￾pathy. For comparing urine and serum analysis and blood
pressure between proteinuric and nonproteinuric subjects,
the female patient with end-stage renal disease (ESRD)
was excluded. For identifying possible renal – extrarenal
phenotype associations, the patient with ESRD was
included in the group of individuals with nephropathy.
Ophthalmologic investigation
Ophthalmologic investigation could be performed in 51
subjects from 16 families, 21 males and 30 females with a
mean age of 39.7 years (range 6 –74 years) at the time of
evaluation. Ocular examination included visual acuity
assessment, intra-ocular pressure (IOP) measurement with
Goldmann applanation tonometry, slit-lamp biomicro￾scopy, gonioscopy, ophthalmoscopy, and visual field in￾vestigation by Humphrey visual field analysis (central 30-2)
and glaucoma hemifield testing. Subjects using intraocular
hypotensive medication interrupted medical therapy 4 days
before examination until completion of ocular examina￾tion. Ocular hypertension was defined by an IOP
421mmHg on two separate occasions. Glaucomatous optic
disk alteration was defined by a cup –disk ratio of Z0.7 or a
difference in the cup –disk ratios of at least 0.2 between
both eyes accompanied by notching of the rim and/or
peripapillary haemorrhages of the optic rim.24 Primary
open-angle glaucoma (POAG) was defined by glaucomatous
cupping of the optic disk, glaucomatous visual field defects,
an IOP 421mmHg on two separate occasions, and open
anterior chamber angle. Normal-tension glaucoma (NTG)
was defined as POAG with the exception of an
IOPr21mmHg at the first ocular examination and con￾firmed by diurnal phasing 6 –12 months later.
Audiometric evaluation
Based on the remarkable similarities between nephropathy
in NPS and Alport syndrome, a type IV collagen kidney
disease associated with sensorineural hearing loss, we
questioned whether hearing loss may accompany NPS
(Figure 1). Otoscopy and pure tone audiometry were
performed in 28 subjects from six families, nine males
and 19 females with a mean age of 46.2 years (range 11 – 75
years) at the time of examination. Individual binaural
mean pure tone thresholds (dB hearing loss, air conduction
level) at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 kHz were compared with
the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
standard 7029 presbyacusis thresholds.25 For genotype –
phenotype studies, an individual severity score for thresh￾old progression beyond the 95th percentile (P95) presbya￾cusis was assessed. Hearing impairment was designated
significant when Z2 out of 6 thresholds at the frequencies
0.25 –8 kHz were 4P95 presbyacusis matched by age and
gender for each ear separately, bilaterally tested with
Po0.05 and unilaterally with Po0.095.25 Additionally,
individual monaural thresholds were compared with
different percentiles (P70 –P95) of presbyacusis to find the
best-fitting percentile of the ISO 7029 threshold distribu￾tion. Four patients were excluded for audiometric analysis,
one individual due to noise trauma and three patients aged

470 years since no age-related reference values are
available beyond 70 years.
Psychological and health state measures
To investigate psychological symptoms and health status,
individuals aged Z16 years were asked to complete the
Dutch version of standardised self-report questionnaires,
including:
1. Psychopathology using the Symptom Checklist
(SCL-90).26
2. Depression using the Beck Depression Inventory, diag￾nosed from a score of 16.27
3. State and trait anxiety using the Spielberger Trait
Anxiety Inventory.28
4. Five personality dimensions using the Revised NEO
Five-Factor Inventory.29
To compute an overall ‘health-related quality of life’
figure, five health state dimensions were assessed using the
EuroQol-5D inventory.30 Additionally, valuation of health
status using a visual analogue scale (VAS) with a score from
0 to 100, representing the lowest to the highest possible
health status was requested.
Mutational and FISH analysis
Direct sequencing of the eight coding exons and flanking
introns of LMX1B was performed on DNA extracted from
peripheral blood lymphocytes as described already.31 In
subjects in which no LMX1B mutation could be identified,
fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) studies were
carried out on metaphases derived from peripheral blood
lymphocytes. For FISH analysis, biotin labelled PAC clones
830-M14 and 1195-M2 located in the LMX1B region were
used according to standard procedures.32
Statistics
Clinical and molecular findings were analysed using linear
and logistic regression models. Since age and gender are
known covariates in developing renal, ocular, audiological,
and psychological anomalies, multivariate analysis of these
symptoms was adjusted for age and gender. For the
comparison between clinical and molecular data within
and between families, analysis of covariance was per￾formed. For all statistics, P-values are two-tailed and
present unadjusted values concerning multiplicity. Signifi￾cance was set at the 5% probability level.
Results
Limb and pelvic malformations
The results of examination of the limbs and pelvis are
summarised in Table 1. Fingernail anomalies were observed
in all subjects (Table 1, Figure 2a). On physical examina￾tion, an abnormal volume distribution of the proximal
musculature of the upper limb was recognised in some NPS
patients, with a lower muscle volume of the dorsal muscle
groups (triceps brachii) compared to the ventral counter￾parts (biceps brachii) (Figure 2b). In the lower limb, such
evident differences between dorsal (quadriceps femoris)
and ventral (hamstrings) proximal musculature volume
were not observed. The severity of nail and orthopaedic
features, scored according to Farley et al20 was mild in
13.4% (11/82) of individuals, moderate in 52.4% (43/82),
and severe in 34.2% (28/82) and was highly variable both
within and between families (Figure 3). The complete
tetralogy of nail, patellar, elbow, and pelvic anomalies
classified according to Farley et al20 was found in 50.6%
(41/81) of individuals.
Nephropathy
The results of nephrological investigations are summarised
in Table 2. Proteinuria was identified in 13 individuals from
six unrelated families and in four sporadic cases by
quantitative urinanalysis of a random urine specimen

(17/80) (Table 2, Figure 3). Isolated proteinuria was
detected in 14.5% (11/76) of individuals, both proteinuria
and hematuria in 6.6% (5/76), and isolated microscopic
hematuria in 11.8% (9/76). ESRD was found in only one
subject of NPS patients overall (1/106). The mean age of
individuals with proteinuria (48.1 years, range 8.7 – 76.2
years) was significantly higher compared to nonproteinuric
individuals (36.0 years, range 0.5 – 81.8 years). Protein –
creatinine ratio was 1.672.1 g/10 mM (range 0.3 – 7.5
g/10 mM) in proteinuric subjects. GFR was below 60 ml/
min/1.73 m2 in 5.3% (4/76) of subjects overall and between
60 and 90 ml/min/1.73 m2 in 34.2% (26/76). Proteinuric
patients had a significantly lower GFR compared to
nonproteinuric patients (Table 2). Patients with isolated
microscopic hematuria had normal GFR (Table 2). Serum
creatinine, albumin and cholesterol, and mean arterial
blood pressure did not differ between proteinuric and
nonproteinuric subjects. Urinanalysis of first morning
specimens demonstrated microalbuminuria in 27.5%
(14/51) of an unselected series of NPS patients and
macroalbuminuria in 3.6% (2/51) (data not shown). In the
series of nonproteinuric subjects, 21.7% (10/46) had micro￾albuminuria detected in the same morning urine specimen.
In microalbuminuric subjects, ACR was 85.3758.3 g/10mM.
Proteinuria was found significantly more frequent in
females (33.3%; 15/45) than in males (5.7%; 2/35), adjusted
for age (Table 2). The same was true for microalbuminuria,
29.6% (8/27) of females versus 16.7% (4/24) of males,
although statistically not significant (P ¼ 0.28). We per￾formed a follow-up study of family 26, which has been
extensively reported with high prevalence (43.4%; 10/23) of
nephropathy 16 years ago.19,31 Previous investigations
demonstrated proteinuria in 33.3% (5/15) of subjects, with
a mean age of 48 years (range 33–61 years) of proteinuric
subjects at the time of examination. Present studies of the
same subjects revealed proteinuria in 40.0% (6/15) with a
mean age of 62 years (49 –77 years) of proteinuric
individuals at the time of examination and progression of
proteinuria compared to earlier studies in three out of five
subjects (Figure 3). One patient from this family had
undergone kidney transplantation at the age of 24 years.
Previous ultrastructural studies of renal biopsy specimens of
the latter patient demonstrated typical GBM anomalies
characteristic for NPS.33 None of the unaffected relatives of
NPS family 26 were reported to have nephropathy.
Ophthalmologic involvement
Glaucoma, isolated glaucomatous alteration of the optic
disk, and ocular hypertension were found in 35.3% (17/51)
of individuals from five out of 16 families (Table 3).
Glaucoma was diagnosed in 11.8% (6/51) of subjects:
POAG in 3.9% (2/51) or NTG in 7.8% (4/51) (Table 3).
Isolated glaucomatous alteration of the optic disk was
found in 23.3% (10/43) of subjects with normal IOP not
using IOP lowering treatment (data not shown). Ocular
hypertension was shown in 3.9% (2/51) of cases. The mean
age at which glaucoma or ocular hypertension had been
detected was 63.4 years (range 55 –72 years). Under the age
of 40 years, one case (1/23) showed glaucomatous optic
disk excavation and one subject had ocular hypertension.
Between 40 and 50 years, 30.8% (4/13) had glaucomatous
alteration of the optic disk. Over 50 years, 13.3% (2/15) had
POAG, 26.7% (4/15) NTG, 33.3% (5/15) glaucomatous
optic disk alterations, and 6.7% (1/15) ocular hyperten￾sion. Mean IOP was 15.5 mmHg (range 10 –30 mmHg),
respectively. No association between excavation of optic
disk and IOP could be demonstrated, suggesting that
pathological cupping of the optic disk in NPS can occur
without elevated IOP. Cataract was found in 7.8% (4/51) of
subjects, including congenital cataract in two siblings
(family 32). Additional anomalies of the anterior segment
included corneal abnormalities, iris pigmentation, and
pigment dispersion syndrome. The frequency of ocular

findings did not differ significantly between males (6/21)
and females (12/30).
Hearing impairment
Otoscopy revealed no pathological findings. Sensorineural
hearing impairment was observed in 45.8% (11/24) of NPS
subjects from four out of six families examined (Table 3). It
was diagnosed bilaterally in 36.4% (4/11) of individuals
and unilaterally in 63.6% (7/11) and equally distributed
across the various frequencies (0.25 –8 kHz). The mean age
at the time of detection was 46.7 years (range 17.5 – 69.2
years). Unaffected family members had normal hearing.
In family 26 with high prevalence of nephropathy,
bilateral hearing impairment was demonstrated in a
statistical significant proportion of individuals with NPS
(Po0.02), whereas in the group of randomly selected NPS
patients unilateral hearing impairment was detected
significantly frequent (Pr0.02) (Table 3, Figure 3). How￾ever, detailed evaluation of the audiograms of individuals
diagnosed with unilateral hearing impairment showed
fairly symmetrical thresholds suggesting bilateral involve￾ment, although significant scores for both ears were
lacking. No significant differences were found in the
frequency of hearing impairment in females (7/16) com￾pared to that in males (4/9).
The NPS individual pure tone threshold data were
comparable to the 78th percentile of presbyacusis
(Figure 2c).25 In total, 52% of the individual thresholds
were 4P78 at all frequencies. Whether the audiometric
results can be interpreted as mildly accentuated presbya￾cusis or, alternatively, as the development of a normal
degree of presbyacusis at an earlier age than is normal
cannot be elucidated as yet.
Psychological and health state findings
Response rate of self-report questionnaires on psychologi￾cal symptoms was 88.2% (75/85). Signs of psychopathol￾ogy, depression, anxiety, and personality dimensions were
comparable to those of the general population. Depression
was diagnosed in four subjects (5.3%; 4/75) from four
unrelated families. Two out of four individuals with
depressive symptoms used antidepressive medication. In
total, six subjects used antidepressive medication and one
patient used anxiolytics at the time of investigation. The
response rate of the health state inventory was 96.4% (81/
84). Findings of health status valuations, including mobi￾lity, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxi￾ety/depression were also similar to those of the general
population.34
LMX1B mutations and FISH results
By mutational screening, 18 different heterozygous LMX1B
mutations were identified in 28 unrelated families, includ￾ing six novel variants (Table 3). In four families in which
no LMX1B mutation could be detected, FISH analysis
revealed no deletions of the entire LMX1B gene. All four
families showed the cardinal findings of NPS. Additionally,
two siblings from one of these families (family 32) are
known with mild mental retardation and congenital
cataract. These families were too small for genetic linkage

studies. DNA CGH-microarray analysis is presently being
performed to identify possible microdeletions/duplica￾tions, including the region encompassing LMX1B.
Genotype –phenotype relationships
No statistical significant differences between 18 different
LMX1B mutations could be established concerning the
presence and severity of the diverse renal and extrarenal
manifestations (data not shown). However, family 26 (with
LMX1B mutation 672 þ 1G4A) demonstrated a high
prevalence (53.3%; 8/15) of nephropathy compared to
family 4 ((C57S), 0%; 0/8), family 5 ((C63G), 7.6%; 1/13)
and NPS patients overall (22.2%; 18/81) (Table 3, Figure 3).
Comparison of phenotypic manifestations with LMX1B
mutation locations (LIM-A and LIM-B domains versus
homeodomain (HD)) demonstrated a significant higher
frequency of nephropathy (15/40) and higher level of total
urinary protein and albumin excretion in individuals with
mutations in the HD than in those with mutations in the
LIM domains (3/38), adjusted for age, gender, and family
(P ¼ 0.046). Analysis of the different putative effects of
identified LMX1B mutations (premature truncation of
protein, disrupted Zn-finger, or DNA-binding) in relation
to the phenotype observed in patients carrying these
mutations revealed no statistically significant relationships
concerning any of the NPS characteristics.
A significant association was identified between the
presence of renal involvement in NPS patients and a
positive family history of nephropathy. In total, 53% of the
variance in proteinuria measured in a random urine sample
could be attributed to the family to which an individual is
belonging, while the LMX1B genotype explained only 30%
of the variance.
The presence and severity of different NPS manifesta￾tions showed high variability at the individual, intrafami￾lial, and interfamilial level (data not shown). Comparison
of extrarenal NPS characteristics between individuals with
and without nephropathy is summarised in Table 4
(Figure 3). A statistically significant association was
identified between radial head hypoplasia and proteinuria
(Po0.01). In contrast to earlier reports35,36 but consistent
with recent observations,17 no relation could be demon￾strated between elbow pterygia (5%; 5/100) and nephro￾pathy (data not shown). Although statistically not
significant, glaucomatous anomalies or ocular hyperten￾sion were observed more frequently in individuals with
renal symptoms (63.6%; 7/11) than subjects without
nephropathy (35.7%; 10/28) (P ¼ 0.11). No significant
differences were found with respect to hearing impair￾ment, nail dysplasia, orthopaedic manifestations, and
various skeletal anomalies between individuals with and
without nephropathy (Table 4).

In this study, new clinical and molecular aspects of NPS
were identified, establishing that: (a) LMX1B mutations

located in the homeodomain and female gender may be
associated with a higher risk for developing nephropathy;
(b) the family history of nephropathy is important in
precipitating the individual risk for developing renal
disease; and that (c) NTG and sensorineural hearing
impairment expand the NPS phenotypic spectrum.
The prevalence of proteinuria (21.3%) detected by
quantitative analysis of a random urine sample is compar￾able to the frequency (22.3%) demonstrated by dipstick
analysis by Sweeney et al.
17 The present finding of a female
predominance for both proteinuria and microalbuminuria
is in contrast with the findings in the general population,
where the prevalence of microalbuminuria is about two￾fold higher in males.37 The reason for this observation is
unclear and needs to be determined. Nephropathy is
known to occur during pregnancy only.17 However, none
of the present 16 females with nephropathy was pregnant
at the time of investigation and six of them had not been
pregnant. Moreover, we have to keep in mind that half of
the female patients with nephropathy belong to family 26
with a relatively high prevalence of nephropathy and that
less males than females were available for investigation
from this family. Microalbuminuria, as the earliest clinically
measurable finding of changes in glomerular permeability
may be an important diagnostic tool, since it represents an
early phase in the spectrum of NPS renal disease. Addition￾ally, microalbuminuria is known to play a role in the
progression of kidney damage and cardiovascular disease.38
Since GFR was significantly lower in proteinuric individuals
compared to nonproteinuric cases, we recommend annual
screening of CrC for detecting changes in glomerular
filtration in proteinuric patients. In addition to the NPS
podocyte disease,7 the severely impaired development of
the glomerular capillary network with less fenestrated
glomerular endothelial cells as seen in Lmx1b/ mice16
may contribute to a decreased GFR in NPS.
The prevalence of NTG (7.8%) in the present NPS
patients is significantly higher than in the general popula￾tion (0.6%).39 Based on the finding of POAG, NTG, and
isolated glaucomatous optic disk alterations in NPS, we
hypothesise that primary structural changes in the mem￾branes of the lamina cribrosa and the trabecular mesh￾work40 may play a role in NPS glaucomatous optic nerve
damage and may result from disrupted collagen expression
and/or an irregular arrangement or deposition of collagen
fibrils similar to glomerular changes in NPS.
Hearing impairment has previously been described in
two out of six subjects from one NPS family, but no
additional familial hearing impairment has been reported
in NPS.41 We found sensorineural hearing impairment in
almost half of the examined NPS individuals. Cosegrega￾tion of hearing impairment and NPS and absence of
audiological anomalies in unaffected family members
further suggest that hearing impairment is another aspect
of the NPS phenotype.
Recently, it has been suggested that disrupted midbrain
dopamine neuron development and function observed in
Lmx1b/ mice may result in psychological symptoms in
human NPS.11,42 Previous psychological evaluation of self￾report questionnaires revealed depression in five out of 10
cases and anxiety symptoms in five out of eight subjects,
respectively.42 In the present psychological assessment of
75 individuals, however, we found no evidence for
psychological symptoms such as depression and mood
symptoms associated with NPS.
Since nephropathy is important for prognosis and
possibly indicative for the occurrence of associated NPS
manifestations, we performed comprehensive nephrologi￾cal examinations and compared extrarenal NPS manifesta￾tions between the subgroups of individuals with and
without nephropathy. A statistically significant association
was only identified between nephropathy and radial head
hypoplasia, but no common pathogenic mechanism could
be proposed for this finding. No association was found
between the presence and severity of nail and patellar
dysplasia and iliac horns at the individual and familial
level, suggesting that NPS manifestations of disrupted
dorso-ventral patterning are not necessarily associated.
Different spatiotemporal effects of LMX1B mutations or
modifier factors may be involved in the highly variable
clinical expression of dorsal NPS features.
A significant association was identified between the
presence of nephropathy in NPS patients and a positive
family history of renal involvement. These findings
indicate a higher degree of interfamilial than intrafamilial
variability for nephropathy. Individuals within a specific
family do not only share the same LMX1B genotype, but
also possible environmental aspects and endogenous risk
cofactors predisposing to nephropathy, such as blood
pressure and modifier genes. However, no relationship
could be established between mean arterial pressure and
protein excretion (Table 4). The influence of other predis￾posing risk factors will be the subject of future studies.
Individuals with mutations located in the HD of LMXIB
showed significant higher frequency of nephropathy and
higher values of proteinuria than individuals with muta￾tions located in the LIM domains. This is in contrast with a
previous compilation of LMX1B mutations in NPS, which
revealed no such relationship: nephropathy was reported
in 55.2% (16/29) of individuals from 20 families with
mutations identified in the HD of LMX1B and in 55.6% (5/
9) of subjects from four families mutations located within
LIM-A or LIM-B domains.43 However, in the latter study,
phenotypic information was provided by anamnestic
history and/or based on qualitative urinanalysis, and no
definition of nephropathy was mentioned. Two other
patients with the same mutation have been reported, both
are without nephropathy.43 In two other familial cases
with a similar LMX1B mutation (672 þ 1G4T), one patient
had nephropathy.43 In the current study, the high
Genotype – phenotype studies nail-patella syndrome

prevalence of nephropathy in patients with HD mutations
is mainly attributable to the large family 26 with a
mutation 672 þ 1G4A (8/15 nephropathy). However, if
we exclude family 26 from statistical analysis, the relation￾ship between nephropathy and the location of the LMX1B
mutation is still significant, emphasizing the presence of
this association in additional NPS families (Tables 3 and 4).
Although haploinsufficiency has been hypothesised as
the main molecular mechanism of NPS, dominant negative
and/or gain-of-function effects cannot be excluded as yet.
In fact, the clustering of mutations in the LIM and HD
domains, including many that predict premature trunca￾tion codons (PTCs), provide strong genetic support for
such dominant effects. More insight is needed in the
molecular functions of LMX1B to resolve the effects of
individual mutations and to elucidate the mechanism that
underlies the distinct nephrological phenotypes.
The present inventory indicates that both LMX1B
genotype and modifier factors shared among family
members may contribute to the development of nephro￾pathy. A possible role of modifier genes in NPS had already
been put forward in 1956 by the assumption that the NPS
phenotype is modulated by the wild-type LMX1B allele.44
Although haplotype analysis and quantification of the
severity of orthopaedic anomalies have given some support
to this hypothesis,20 recent single-nucleotide polymorph￾ism (SNP) analyses across the LMX1B gene suggest a
relationship between the haplotype of the mutant allele
and the severity of nail anomalies.45 Previous studies on
the candidate modifier gene CLIM2, encoding a transcrip￾tional activator interacting with LMX1B, revealed no
correlation between different CLIM2 polymorphisms and
the renal phenotype in our family 26 (LMX1B mutation
672 þ 1G4A) with high prevalence of nephropathy.46 A
previous observation15,47 of ESRD in one, and absence of
renal symptoms in the other half of identical male twins
with NPS emphasizes a role of external and/or endogenous
cofactors in the development and progression of renal
disease. In the present study, no association could be
identified between the LMX1B genotype and severity
scores of various extrarenal NPS characteristics, indicating
that different modifier factors may also be involved in
extrarenal NPS features.
Further studies on candidate modifier genes are neces￾sary to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying
inter- and intrafamilial phenotypic variation and to
identify cofactors involved in the progression to glaucoma
and terminal renal insufficiency in NPS. Pyrosequencing
and whole-genome microarray techniques offer compre￾hensive genotyping solutions for detecting individual
genetic variations, including SNPs, insertion/deletion
polymorphisms, and mutations in genetic modifiers. Gene
expression profiling of urinary podocytes from NPS
patients with and without renal symptoms is presently
being performed.
The first indication that hearing impairment and NTG
are part of the NPS phenotype and the finding that LMX1B
mutation location, family history, and female gender may
be associated with the NPS renal phenotype requires
confirmation in additional families before applying into
counselling. Further investigation and follow-up of addi￾tional large LMX1B mutation and clinically well-charac￾terised NPS pedigrees, will be of enormous value to finally
elucidate the cofactors underlying the phenotypic varia￾bility and the complete phenotype of NPS.
In agreement with the recommendations for clinical
management proposed by Sweeney et al,
17 we stress the
necessity of annual measurement of albumin/creatinine
ratio in a first morning specimen starting from birth and
additionally annual ophthalmologic screening, including
investigation of glaucomatous optic disk alterations from
late childhood. NPS patients carrying mutations in the HD
of LMX1B, especially from families with a positive family
history of nephropathy, require comprehensive renal
studies.
