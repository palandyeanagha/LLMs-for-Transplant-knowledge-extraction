SUMMARY
Parasitological and immunological diagnoses were part of a study conducted among 151 children, 83 immunocompromised (IC)
and 68 non-immunocompromised (non-IC) aged from zero to 12, seen at the University Hospital, Universidade Federal de Uberlândia,
State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, from February, 1996, to June, 1998. Three fecal samples from each child were analyzed for the
parasitological diagnosis by Baermann-Moraes and Lutz methods. The immunological diagnosis to detect IgG and IgM antibodies
was carried out by the indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) with cryo-microtome sections of Strongyloides stercoralis
and Strongyloides ratti larvae as antigens and by the ELISA test with an alkaline extract of S. ratti as the antigens. Of the 151 children
5 (3.31%) were infected with larvae of S. stercoralis (2 cases IC, 2.41%, and 3 cases non-IC, 4.41%). The IFAT-IgG detected 7
(8.43%) serum samples positive among IC, and 2 (2.94%) cases among non-IC. The ELISA-IgG test detected 10 (12.05%) serum
samples positive among IC, and 1 (1.47%) case among non-IC. The IFAT-IgM detected 6 (7.22%) positive cases among IC, and 3
(4.41%) cases among non-IC. ELISA-IgM test detected 10 (12.05%) positive cases among IC, and 3 (4.41%) cases among non-IC. It
was concluded that the immunological tests can help in the diagnosis of strongyloidiasis in immunocompromised children.
KEYWORDS: Strongyloides stercoralis; Strongyloidiasis; Diagnosis; Children; Immunocompromised.
Strongyloides stercoralis is one of the most difficult parasitic
infections to diagnose. In normal hosts, it causes chronic or subclinical
infections that can persist for decades without any adverse effect.
However, in immunocompromised hosts S. stercoralis may cause a
frequently fatal hyperinfection or disseminated disease11. Many cases of
strongyloidiasis were described among a variety of conditions of
immunosuppression, especially impairment of cell-mediated immunity,
such as hematologic malignancies10,19, lymphoma21, renal transplantation9
and HIV+
 (human immunodeficiency virus infection) 8.
The parasitological methods have low sensitivity even when repeated
several times and have to be performed on fresh stools, rarely a standard
procedure in hospital clinical laboratories7,11. Several studies support
the view that detection of parasite-specific antibodies may be a useful
complement to the traditional parasitological diagnosis of strongyloidiasis
using the indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT)4,12 and
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)3,13,22.
The purpose of the present study was to detect S. stercoralis infection
in immunocompromised (IC) and non-immunocompromised (non-IC)
children aged from zero to 12 years of age seen at the University Hospital,
Universidade Federal de Uberlândia, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, from
February, 1996, to June, 1998.
The study was conducted among 151 children, 83 IC (46
malignancies, 8 protein-calorie malnutrition degree II and III, 6 HIV+, 3
acquired immune deficiency syndrome - AIDS, 3 renal insufficiency, 3
rheumatic fever, 3 falciform anemia, 2 nephrotic syndrome, 2
politraumatism, 1 renal transplantation, 1 cardiac insuficiency, 1 mellitus
diabetes, 1 mucoviscidosis, 1 hepatic insufficiency, 1 Gaucher’s disease,
1 necrotic enterocolite) that were clinically confirmed18,23 and were being
treated with immunosuppressive agents; and 68 non-IC hospitalized
children with other non-immunosupressive infections. Fecal and serum
samples were collected for both groups after previous written
authorization from those responsible for the children. None of the patients
of the two groups presented clinical or parasitological diagnosis of
strongyloidiasis.
To parasitological diagnosis, three fecal samples from each child
were collected in plastic vials without preservatives with intervals of 4
to 15 days and analyzed by the BAERMANN1
, MORAES17 and LUTZ15
methods. Six slides were prepared for each method for each of the 453

samples. The total number of slides examined was thus 5,436. All the
families of the children received the results of the laboratory diagnosis.
The positive cases were given specific treatment.
To immunological diagnosis, S. stercoralis larvae were obtained from
the feces of patients seen at the same University Hospital and S. ratti
was obtained from the feces of experimentally infected rats (Rattus
rattus). The larvae of each antigen were mixed with an equal part of
finely ground charcoal, moistened with water, spread in an uniform layer
on Petri dishes and incubated at 25 °C for 5 days. The filariform larvae
were then harvested by the BAERMANN1
, MORAES17 technique,
concentrated by centrifugation at 1000g for 5 minutes and stored at –20
°C until the time of use.
For IFAT, S. stercoralis and S. ratti antigens were prepared according
to COSTA-CRUZ et al.4
. For ELISA, the alkaline extract was prepared
with the addition of 1 ml of 0.15 M NaOH at 4 °C for 6 hours of agitation.
Subsequently, adding 0.5 ml of 0.3 M of HCl until the pH reached 7.0.
This preparation was centrifuged at 3000g for 15 minutes at 4 °C and
the supernatant was submitted to LOWRY et al.14 method for protein
detection.
The immunofluorescence - IgG tests for S. stercoralis and S. ratti
antigens utilized in the present work was done according to COSTA￾CRUZ et al.
4
. The authors described 94.4% and 94.2% respectively of
sensitivity and specificity to S. stercoralis and respectively 92.5% and
97.1% to S. ratti for IgG antibodies, considered titers positive when ³
20. For IgM antibodies, IFAT was standardized previously by PEIXOTO20
with 37.0% and 29.6% positive serum samples detected in patients with
strongyloidiasis, by S. stercoralis and S. ratti antigens respectively;
considered titers positive when ³ 40. The tests, in the present study,
were performed simultaneously for each serum using each of the two
antigens. The fluoresceinated anti-human IgG and IgM conjugate (Biolab,
Brazil) were added at the ideal titers of 100 (for both antigens) and 20
(for both antigens), respectively.
ELISA was previously described by COSTA-CRUZ et al.
5 with a
sensitivity of 93.4% and specificity of 96.9% for IgG antibodies. For
IgM antibodies, ELISA was standardized previously by COSTA-CRUZ
et al.
6
 and 44.26% positive serum samples were detected in patients
with confirmed strongyloidiasis. The cut off was determined as BASSI
et al.
2 with two standard deviations. The results were expressed as titers,
which were considered positive when ³ 80. The anti-human IgG and
IgM labeled with peroxidase (Sigma) was added respectively at titers
4000 and 2000.
All positive serum sample IgM antibodies were tested using the “Kit
Reumatex â ” (Doles, Brazil) and FTA sorbent (Laborclin, Brazil).
The normality of distribution was tested for two proportions and X2
at the significance level of 5%16 to compare the results obtained with
two groups.
From the 151 children studied, 139 (92.05%) were from the State of
Minas Gerais (86, 56.95%, from Uberlândia) 11 (7.28%) from the State
of Goiás and 1 (0.66%) from the State of Mato Grosso do Sul.
The distribution of intestinal parasites and comensal in IC and non￾IC children is showed in Table 1. Of the 151 children studied 5 (3.31%)
were infected with larvae of S. stercoralis. Two of these cases (2.41%)
were IC, both were girls in the category of two to four years and 3
(4.41%) were non-IC, all were boys, one case being in the category of
two years of age or under and two cases in the category of between ten
and twelve. No statistical difference was observed by test for the two
proportions (Z= 0.69, p>0.05) in the occurrence of S. stercoralis between
the two groups.
The IFAT-IgG detected 9 (5.96%) positive serum samples, 7 (8.43%)
IC and 2 (2.94%) non-IC. The 7 (8.43%) cases of IC were detected by
the S. stercoralis antigen, 4 (4.82%) of these were also S. ratti antigen
positives. The S. stercoralis antigen detected 2 (2.94%) positive cases

difference was observed using the test for the two proportions between
the two antigens or the two groups (p>0.05).
The ELISA-IgG test detected 11 (7.28%) positive serum samples,
10 (12.05%) among IC and 1 (1.47%) among non-IC. The ELISA-IgM
test detected 13 (8.61%) positive cases, 10 (12.05%) among IC and 3

two groups in ELISA-IgG (Z=3.84, p<0.05) and ELISA-IgM (Z=2.75,
p<0.05).
All IgM positive serum samples were negative in rheumatic factor
research.
From the 151 children 19 (12.58%) were positive for S. stercoralis,
considering the parasitological and immunological diagnoses, 16
(10.60%) were from the State of Minas Gerais [9 (5.96%) from
Uberlândia] and 3 (1.99%) from the State of Goiás, aged from five months
to 12 years, and of both sexes.
Positive children to S. stercoralis are shown in the Table 2. The
comparison of positive cases to S. stercoralis by parasitological and
immunological diagnoses is shown in Figure 1.
Considering immunosuppression as a risk factor of strongyloidiasis
and the high positive rate of immunological tests among IC, the present
study shows the value of IFAT and ELISA in the detection of IgG and
IgM antibodies in diagnosis of human strongyloidiasis among
immunocompromised children, contributing to the establishment of the
diagnosis of this parasitosis and the possibility of early treatment of
these children.
RESUMO
Diagnóstico parasitológico e imunológico da estrongiloidíase em
crianças imunodeprimidas e imunocompetentes na cidade de
Uberlândia, MG, Brasil
O diagnóstico parasitológico e imunológico da estrongiloidíase foi
realizado em 151 crianças (83 imunodeprimidas -ID e 68 imuno￾competentes -IC) de zero a 12 anos de idade internadas no Hospital de
Clínicas da Universidade Federal de Uberlândia, Minas Gerais, Brasil,
no período de fevereiro de 1996 a junho de 1998. Para o diagnóstico
parasitológico três amostras de fezes de cada indivíduo foram processadas
pelos métodos de Baermann-Moraes e de Lutz. O diagnóstico
imunológico para a detecção de anticorpos IgG e IgM foi realizado através
das reações de imunofluorescência indireta (RIFI) utilizando-se como
antígeno cortes de 4 micra de larvas filarióides de Strongyloides
stercoralis e Strongyloides ratti e do teste ELISA utilizando-se como
antígeno extrato alcalino de larvas de S. ratti. Das 151 crianças, 5 (3,31%)
estavam infectadas com S. stercoralis (2 casos ID, 2,41% e 3 casos IC,
4,41%). A RIFI- IgG detectou 7 (8,43%) amostras de soros positivas
nas ID, e 2 (2,94%) nas IC. O teste ELISA-IgG detectou 10 (12,05%)
amostras de soros positivas nas ID, e 1 (1,47%) nas IC. A RIFI-IgM
detectou 6 (7,22%) casos positivos nas ID, e 3 (4,41%) nas IC. O teste
ELISA-IgM detectou 10 (12,05%) casos positivos nas ID e 3 (4,41%)
nas IC. Concluiu-se que os testes imunológicos podem contribuir para o
diagnóstico da estrongiloidíase em crianças imunodeprimidas.
