Axon– glial interactions are critical for normal functioning of peripheral nerves, and their disruption leads to peripheral neuropathies.
Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are key players in peripheral nerve regeneration after injury. We investigated the role of FGF receptor
(Fgfr) signaling in Schwann cells and the consequent regulation of normal Schwann cell–axon interactions. Fgfr1 and Fgfr2 were condi￾tionally inactivated, either singly or in combination, in myelinating and nonmyelinating Schwann cells (NMSCs) of transgenic mice. The
double mutant mice displayed significant loss of thermal sensitivity accompanied by marked neuropathy of unmyelinated nociceptive
sensory axons terminating in the dorsal horn of spinal cords, the primary site for integrating pain and temperature inputs. Neuropathy,
althoughto a lesser extent, was also observedinthe nociceptive C-fibersinthe Remak bundles of sciatic nerves; however,there was no loss
of NMSCs that ensheathe these axons. Furthermore, axons wrapped by myelinating Schwann cells and associated myelin sheaths ap￾pearedto be unaffected. Relativetothe double mutants, axonal neuropathy developed much later inthe Fgfr1 but not Fgfr2 single mutant,
indicating a difference in signaling potential of the two receptors, with Fgfr1 being more robust than Fgfr2. These findings emphasize the
importance of Fgfr1 and Fgfr2 signaling as potential mediators of axon– glial interaction in the peripheral sensory pain pathway primar￾ily via influencing NMSC function, which in turn modulates the structure and function of unmyelinated sensory axons. This study
provides a novel molecular mechanismfor nociception with possibleimplicationsfor pain sensitivityin peripheral sensory neuropathies.

Introduction
Schwann cell–axon interactions are critical for the normal devel￾opment and functioning of peripheral nerves (Nave and Trapp,
2008). Myelinating Schwann cells wrap multilamellar mem￾branes around large-diameter axons to form myelin, while non￾myelinating Schwann cells (NMSCs) form Remak bundles that
ensheathe several small diameter unmyelinated sensory axons
(C-fibers). These C-fibers are primarily responsible for nocicep￾tion, the sensory detection of noxious stimulus, including ther￾mal stimuli (Shir and Seltzer, 1090). Several molecules, such as
Neuregulin 1 (Chen et al., 2003; Michailov et al., 2004), L1
(Haney et al., 1999), integrins (Feltri et al., 2002), MAG (myelin￾associated glycoprotein) (Yin et al., 1998), and Po (Li et al., 2006),
have been implicated in mediating interactions between periph￾eral axons and Schwann cells. However, the molecular mecha￾nisms underlying Schwann cell–axon interactions and the in￾volvement of other signaling molecules in this process remain to
be further elucidated.
Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) is a key regulator of periph￾eral nerve regeneration following injury (for review, see Grothe
and Nikkhah, 2001). FGF2 and three of its receptors, Fgfr1, Fgfr2,
and Fgfr3, are expressed by Schwann cells and dorsal root gan￾glion (DRG) neurons and are upregulated following injury (Gro￾the and Nikkhah, 2001). FGF2 is a known mitogen for Schwann
cells in culture (Davis and Stroobant, 1990), and its important
role during regeneration of myelinated peripheral nerves has
been well documented in FGF2-null and Fgfr3-null mice (Grothe
et al., 2006). However, the role and mechanisms of FGF signaling
via Fgfr1 and Fgfr2, particularly in NMSCs for maintaining nor￾mal peripheral nerve structure and function, is poorly under￾stood. Therefore, to elucidate the in vivo role of FGF signaling in
the PNS, we generated conditional knock-out mice with dis￾rupted Fgfr1 and Fgfr2 signaling in both myelinating Schwann
cells and NMSCs.
We found that a lack of Fgfr1 and Fgfr2 signaling in NMSCs in
the double mutant and to a lesser extent in the Fgfr1 single mu￾tant resulted in neuropathy of unmyelinated C-fiber sensory ax￾ons and was accompanied by functional impairment of thermal
sensitivity without loss of NMSCs. These findings emphasize the
importance of FGF signaling for normal functioning of NMSCs

Materials and Methods
Generation of Fgfr1 and Fgfr2 single and Fgfr1/Fgfr2 double
conditional knock-out mice
The generation of floxed Fgfr1flox/ and Fgfr2flox/ (129SV/CD1 strains)
and CNPcre/ mice (2,3-cyclic nucleotide 3-phosphohydrolase;
C57BL/6 strain) has been previously described (Pirvola et al., 2002;
Lappe-Siefke et al., 2003; Kaga et al., 2006). Briefly, loxP sites in the
Fgfr1flox/ mice flank regions encoding the transmembrane and tyrosine
kinase domains and in the Fgfr2flox/ mice flank the ligand-binding IgIII
domain and the transmembrane domain of the receptors. Deletion of
these regions renders these receptors inactive (Pirvola et al., 2002; Kaga et
al., 2006).
As described previously (Kaga et al., 2006), to generate single or double
conditional knock-out mice, Fgfr1flox/, Fgfr2flox/, or Fgfr1flox/flox;
Fgfr2flox/flox transgenic mice were suitably crossed with CNPcre/ mice to
produce progeny in which Fgfr1 and/or Fgfr2 are disrupted in CNP￾expressing myelinating and nonmyelinating Schwann cells and
oligodendrocytes.
The efficiency and specificity of Fgfr1 and Fgfr2 recombination was
assessed by PCR, immunoblotting, and in situ hybridization (supple￾mental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material)
(Kaga et al., 2006). CNPCre/ mice were also mated with reporter mice,
Rosa26-YFP (yellow fluorescent protein), for assessment of Cre￾mediated recombination in the sciatic nerve and spinal cord (supple￾mental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).
Behavior tests
Hot plate test. The hot plate test was performed as described (Crawley,
2007) using analgesia meter (myNeuroLab) maintained at 52 or 55 
0.2°C. Mice of three age groups (1–2, 6 –9,
12–15 months) were placed on the hot plate and
the time taken to begin licking their hindpaws,
shaking, or jumping (latency) was recorded. To
minimize damage to the tissue a cutoff times of
60 or 30 s were set. Test was performed blindly
with respect to the genotypes of the mice by
three investigators.
von Frey test. Mechanical sensitivity of mice
was evaluated by this test as described previ￾ously (Chen et al., 2003; Crawley, 2007) (sup￾plemental Fig. 3, available at www.jneurosci.org
as supplemental material).
Motor function tests. Rotarod and hanging￾wire tests were performed as described previ￾ously (Crawley, 2007) (supplemental Fig. 3,
available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental
material).
Histology and immunohistochemistry
Mice were perfused with 4% paraformalde￾hyde/PBS. Sciatic nerves, sural nerves, DRGs,
and spinal cords were cryoprotected and em￾bedded, and cryostat cross sections (15 m)
were prepared. Sections were incubated over￾night (4°C) in anti-calcitonin-gene-related￾protein (CGRP; 1:200; Bachem), anti-p75 (1:
200; Promega), anti--amyloid precursor
protein (-APP; 1:500; Zymed Laboratories),
or biotinylated Griffonia simplicifolia lectin-I
isolectin-B4 (IB4; 1:100; Vector Laboratories).
For -APP, sections were pretreated with 0.1%
H2O2 and heated (5 min, 0.1 M citrate buffer,
pH 6). Sections were incubated (1 h) with sec￾ondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa 488 or
594 (1:500; Invitrogen) or Cy3 (1:600, Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories) or with avi￾din– biotin peroxidase (ABC-Kit; Vector Labo￾ratories). Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342. For Fluoro￾Jade B labeling, the sections were dehydrated, rehydrated, treated with
0.06% potassium permanganate (10 min), and incubated in 0.0004%
Fluoro-Jade B solution in 0.1% acetic acid (20 min).
Electron microscopy
Electron microscopy on spinal cords and sciatic nerves was performed as
described (Marcus et al., 2006). Sections (1 m) were stained with tolu￾idine blue for light microscopy.
In situ hybridization, immunoblotting, and PCR
These procedures were performed as described previously (Kaga et al.,
2006) (supplemental Figs. 1, 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supple￾mental material).
Results
Floxed Fgfr1 and Fgfr2 transgenic mice were crossed with
CNPcre/ mice to produce progeny with single or double Fgfr null
mutations in CNP-expressing cells. In the peripheral nervous
system, CNP is expressed by myelinating Schwann cells and
NMSCs, but not by neurons (Toma et al., 2007). CNP-Cre￾mediated recombination was specifically achieved in the Fgfr
mutant mice (supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.
org as supplemental material) (see Materials and Methods).
The ultrastructure of Fgfr1/;Fgfr2/ sciatic nerves was an￾alyzed by electron microscopy and semithin sections. We found
that the loss of these receptors did not adversely affect the struc￾ture or numbers of myelinated axons and that the myelin ap￾peared to be well compacted, with no reduction in thickness or in
P0 protein expression (supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.

In contrast, some sensory axons in the Re￾mak bundles of Fgfr1/;Fgfr2/ sciatic
nerves contained electron-dense struc￾tures (Fig. 1A) suggestive of axonal degen￾eration (Yamano et al., 1982). Such struc￾tures were never found in littermate
controls. Since a few Remak bundles in
Fgfr1/;Fgfr2/ sciatic nerves clearly
had degenerating axons, we asked whether
a widespread defect in sensory axon integ￾rity was more apparent by measuring no￾ciception in Fgfr1/;Fgfr2/ mice. We
therefore performed the “hot plate” test to
examine the response of thermal nocicep￾tion conveyed primarily by unmyelinated
C-fibers found in Remak bundles (Fig.
1B). Fgfr1/;Fgfr2/ mice, tested using
three different age groups (1–2, 6 –9,
12–15 months), exhibited significantly
longer (1.6-fold) paw withdrawal laten￾cies than littermate control mice at 55°C.
The same test, performed at 52.5°C,
yielded similar results (data not shown).
These findings suggest that Fgfr1/;
Fgfr2/ mice have significantly impaired
thermosensory functions in unmyelinated
axons.
We also performed the von Frey, ro￾tarod, and hanging-wire tests using these
mice to evaluate their mechanosensory
and motor functions, which are driven
primarily by myelinated axons (Shir and
Seltzer, 1990). No impairment of these
functions was observed, consistent with
the normal structure of peripheral myelin￾ated axons in these mutants (supplemental
Figs. 2, 3, available at www.jneurosci.org as
supplemental material).
How do such profound physiological
changes occur in the absence of dramatic
axonal loss in the Remak bundles? Since
lamina I and II of the dorsal horn of the
spinal cord (Fig. 2Aa) is the predominant
site that receives the unmyelinated noci￾ceptive C-fiber afferents and is a primary
site for integrating pain and temperature
sensation information, one explanation
might be that there are disrupted connec￾tions in this region (Hunt and Mantyh,
2001). Toluidine blue staining of Fgfr1/;
Fgfr2/ spinal cords revealed numerous
large round structures (spheroids) restricted to the lamina I and
II of the dorsal horn (Fig. 2Ba,Bb). These abnormalities were seen
in both the cervical and lumbar regions of Fgfr1/;Fgfr2/
mice spinal cords. Electron microscopy analysis (Fig. 2Ab—Ad)
revealed large (10 –20 m) axonal spheroids that correspond to
the dense spheroids seen in the toluidine blue stained semithin
sections (Fig. 2B). These spheroids are membrane-bound struc￾tures containing large collections of dense bodies and vesicles
with membrane whorls and amorphous substances of varying
densities. These materials selectively accumulated in the sphe￾roids but not in the cytoplasm of neighboring cells. The spheroi￾dal structures were never observed in control littermate mice,
even at 14 months of age. Immunostaining with anti--amyloid
precursor protein (-APP) and Fluoro-Jade B, two common
markers of degenerating axons (Coleman, 2005; Schmued et al.,
1997) (Fig. 2Bc–Bf) showed labeling of spheroids by these mark￾ers in lamina I and II of Fgfr1/;Fgfr2/ dorsal horns, but not
in control mice. Thus, the spheroids of mutant spinal cords are
degenerating nociceptive C-fiber axons, and their disruption is
consistent with impaired nociceptive signaling.
C-fibers are divided into two mostly nonoverlapping groups:

derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) terminating almost exclu￾sively within the inner lamina II; and (2) fibers containing
calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P, and TrkA
receptor, terminating primarily in lamina I and outer lamina II
(Hunt and Mantyh, 2001). Although both C-fiber types are no￾ciceptive and respond to similar stimuli, their differential axonal
receptor expression profiles suggest that their response to growth
factors may also differ. Therefore, we labeled spinal cord sections
for IB4 and CGRP to confirm that the spheroids correspond to
nociceptive C-fibers and to determine
their subtype (Fig. 3A). The large spheroi￾dal structures were found to be strongly
labeled by IB4 (in lamina II) and CGRP (in
lamina I/II) in Fgfr1/;Fgfr2/ mice.
These structures were not colabeled with
the Hoechst nuclear stain, confirming that
these were axonal structures and not cell
bodies. These data strongly suggest that
both subgroups of sensory C-fibers in
Fgfr1/;Fgfr2/ mice undergo neuro￾pathological changes.
Is the observed C-fiber neuropathology
a consequence of disrupted signaling dur￾ing development or a loss of signals re￾quired for maintenance of axonal integ￾rity? To answer this question we analyzed
spinal cords from control and Fgfr1/;
Fgfr2/ mice as a function of age (Fig.
3A,B). No spheroids (IB4 or CGRP)
were observed at P9 (data not shown), and
only small spheroids could be occasionally
observed at P15 in the mutants. Their size
and number, however, increased progres￾sively with age becoming quite prominent
by one-two months (Fig. 3A,B). A similar
conclusion was obtained by analyzing
-APP and semithin sections (data not
shown). Why does elimination of Fgfr1/
Fgfr2 in NMSCs cause C-fiber axonal neu￾ropathy? Loss of FGF signaling in the
NMSCs might adversely affect their viabil￾ity, resulting in axon degeneration similar
to mice with disrupted NRG1-ErbB sig￾naling (Chen et al., 2003). To investigate
this possibility, we immunostained sciatic
nerves and C-fiber rich sural nerve sec￾tions with anti-p75, a marker of NMSCs,
and counted the total number of positive
cells (Fig. 3C). No differences were found
between control and Fgfr1/;Fgfr2/
mice, suggesting sensory axon degenera￾tion is not due to a loss of NMSCs.
Is the axonal degeneration in the
Fgfr1/;Fgfr2/ double mutant due to a
loss of signaling via Fgfr1 or Fgfr2 or both?
To address this question we analyzed
Fgfr1/ and Fgfr2/ single mutants as a
function of age. Examination of the dorsal
horn by immunolabeling for IB4, CGRP,
and -APP or by toluidine blue stained
semithin section and EM showed that in
contrast to double mutants there was no
axonal degeneration in either of the single
mutants up to 7 months. By 8 months, however, Fgfr1/ but not
Fgfr2/ mice developed numerous axonal spheroids in lamina
I/II (Fig. 4; supplemental Fig. 4, available at www.jneurosci.org as
supplemental material), suggesting involvement of both recep￾tors, with Fgfr1 playing a more prominent role than Fgfr2.
Discussion
Pathology of myelinated axons is a common feature in several
hereditary peripheral neuropathies in which myelinating

Schwann cells bear the primary mutation, suggesting an impor￾tant modulatory influence of myelinating Schwann cells on axons
(Sahenk, 1999; Wrabetz et al., 2004; Nave and Trapp, 2008).
Here, we report that disruption of Fgfr1 and Fgfr2 signaling in
nonmyelinating Schwann cells (NMSCs) resulted in neuropathy
of nonmyelinated peripheral sensory axons, accompanied by sig￾nificant insensitivity to noxious thermal stimuli. In contrast, no
abnormalities were observed in the structure or functions of my￾elinated axons from disrupted Fgfr signaling.
The large spheroidal structures observed in lamina I and II of
the spinal cord dorsal horn in the Fgfr1/;Fgfr2/ mice may
represent degenerating presynaptic axonal terminal or distal re￾gion of C-fiber sensory axons. Similar spheroids, reminiscent of
proliferative lysosomal structures have been observed in various
lysosomal storage disorders (Fujisawa, 1988), including
Niemann-Pick type C disease, where they were observed in the
dorsal horn and described as “dystrophic presynaptic axonal ter￾minals” (Ohara et al., 2004). Similar structures were also reported
in Alzheimer disease (Nixon, 2007). It should be noted that al￾though dramatic neuropathy of axonal terminals was observed in
the dorsal horn of Fgfr mutant mice, no loss of neuronal cell
bodies was seen in the DRG by electron microscopy (data not
shown). This raises the possibility that spheroid formation may
represent a form of distal axonopathy in which the terminal por￾tion of axons and presynaptic axon terminals are preferentially
affected. It has been shown that axons degenerate earlier than the
cell body in Niemann-Pick type C mouse brain (Ohara et al.,
2004) and after transaction of the sciatic nerve (Tandrup et al.,
2000). Furthermore, in certain conditions, neuronal cell bodies
remain viable even while the axons are degenerating (Sagot et al.,
1995), dissociating neuronal and axonal functions. Axonal sphe￾roids in the rat gracile nuclei can also develop as a consequence of
normal aging (Fujisawa, 1988). However in the Fgfr1/;
Fgfr2/ mutants these structures first appear in young adults,
suggesting that this defect differs from that seen in normal aging
animals. C-fiber-evoked activity in the dorsal horn begins to de￾velop gradually only over the postnatal period into adulthood
(Fitzgerald, 2005); similarly, the manifestation of the C-fiber de￾fect in our mutant mice also developed over approximately a
parallel time frame. Therefore, it is possible that the defect may be
somehow correlated with the functional maturity of the C-fibers.
Although Schwann cells and DRG neurons both express Fgfr1
and Fgfr2 (Grothe and Nikkhah, 2001), these receptors should be
eliminated in principle only from CNP-expressing Schwann cells
of Fgfr1 and Fgfr2 conditional knock-out mice. Nevertheless, the
possibility exists that Fgfrs may have also been eliminated from
Figure 4. Unmyelinatedsensory axon degenerate in Fgfr1/ but not in Fgfr2/ mice. Spinal cord crosssectionsshowing dorsal horn(DH) of control andFgfr1/ orFgfr2/ micestained

(supplemental Fig. 4, available at www.jneurosci.org assupplemental material). By 8M,they appeared intheFgfr1/ but never in Fgfr2/ mice. Three controls and mutants were examined for
each analysis. Representative images are shown. Scale bars: IB4 and CGRP, 100m; -APP, toluidine blue, and inset, 50m.

DRG neurons as a result of a Cre-mediated recombination that
occurred earlier in embryonic development if CNP promoter
activity were present in neural precursors. Furthermore, dysfunc￾tion of sensory neurons can potentially occur due to deletion of
Fgfrs from the peripheral (skin) or central (spinal cord neurons)
targets of unmyelinated axons, resulting in impairment of tro￾phic support from these targets. In situ hybridization analysis of
the mutant mice, using a probe against the deleted sequence of
Fgfr1, failed to demonstrate loss of Fgfr1 from either DRG and
spinal cord neurons or from regions of the skin that are inner￾vated by C-fibers, thus ruling out these possibilities (supplemen￾tal Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental mate￾rial). We therefore favor the model in which the neuropathy of
sensory neurons in mutant mice is caused by the elimination of
Fgfr1 and Fgfr2 in NMSCs, which then indirectly modulate neu￾ronal function, leading to neuropathy.
The phenotypic difference that was observed between Fgfr1
and Fgfr2 single mutants suggests that these Fgfrs have distinct
signaling potentials, thresholds, or specificities in NMSCs, as has
been observed in oligodendrocytes (Fortin et al., 2005). Although
Fgfr1 signaling is more robust than Fgfr2, the phenotype of
Fgfr1/;Fgfr2/ double mutants is more severe than the
Fgfr1/ single mutant, suggesting that Fgfr2 is involved as well.
Thus, the phenotype of the double mutant potentially emerges
from cooperative signaling by both receptors.
Degeneration and loss of sensory axons resulting from loss of
NMSCs bearing the ErbB receptor mutation has been reported
(Chen et al., 2003); however, unlike the ErbB mutant, the axonal
degeneration in the Fgfr1/;Fgfr2/ mice was not coupled to
the death of NMSCs. Therefore NMSC mortality may not be
necessary, and simply perturbing NMSC receptor function may
be sufficient to adversely modulate axonal function. Neverthe￾less, in both cases it is clear that disruption of axon– glia signaling
resulted in neuropathology.
Exactly how Fgfr1/2 signaling in NMSCs influences axonal
function remains to be determined. A model can be proposed in
which Fgfr signaling in NMSCs regulates the production or de￾livery of certain trophic factors or regulates the expression of cell
surface ligands that are essential for normal function or survival
of axons, the disruption of which in the mutant would then result
in axonal neuropathy and degeneration. For example, FGF sig￾naling is known to upregulate GDNF and NGF mRNA in cells
expressing Fgfr1 and Fgfr2 (Suter-Crazzolara and Unsicker,
1996; Ferhat et al., 1997). These growth factors, produced by
Schwann cells (Bandtlow et al., 1987; Hammarberg et al., 1996),
provide essential trophic support to sensory neurons expressing
receptors of these growth factors (Chen et al., 2003). Disruption
of Fgfr1/2 signaling in nonmyelinating Schwann cells may also
affect the expression of modulatory molecules (such as MAG for
myelinating Schwann cells) (Yin et al., 1998) that function as
ligands to help stabilize the axonal cytoskeleton and transport.
Impairment of axonal transport may in turn lead to the accumu￾lation of molecules, organelles, and disorganized cytoskeletal el￾ements in local enlargements of distal axons or axon terminals,
thereby giving rise to spheroidal structures. The accumulation of
-APP in these spheroids, as seen in the mutants, is consistent
with a failure in efficient axonal transport, which is considered as
an early event in the process of axonal degeneration (Coleman,
2005).
In summary, the selective loss of Fgfr1/2 signaling in NMSCs
results in marked neuropathy of sensory C-fibers accompanied
by significant insensitivity to thermal stimuli. We propose that
neuron-derived FGFs activate glial Fgfrs, which then transduce
signals for production of trophic factors or adhesion molecules
that are essential for maintenance of sensory functions like axonal
transport or survival. Dysfunction of NMSC and Fgfr signaling
may therefore be implicated in the modulation of pain sensitivity
in peripheral sensory neuropathies.
