Abstract
Background
Neurological complications after lung transplantation are common. The full spectrum of neu￾rological complications and their impact on clinical outcomes has not been extensively
studied.
Methods
We investigated the neurological incidence of complications, categorized according to
whether they affected the central, peripheral or autonomic nervous systems, in a series of
109 patients undergoing lung transplantation at our center between January 1 2013 and
December 31 2014.
Results
Fifty-one patients (46.8%) presented at least one neurological complication. Critical illness
polyneuropathy-myopathy (31 cases) and phrenic nerve injury (26 cases) were the two
most prevalent complications. These two neuromuscular complications lengthened hospital
stays by a median period of 35.5 and 32.5 days respectively. However, neurological compli￾cations did not affect patients’ survival.
Conclusions
The real incidence of neurological complications among lung transplant recipients is proba￾bly underestimated. They usually appear in the first two months after surgery. Despite not
affecting mortality, they do affect the mean length of hospital stay, and especially the time
spent in the Intensive Care Unit. We found no risk factor for neurological complications

Introduction
Lung transplantation has been established as a therapeutic option for patients in the terminal
stages of pulmonary disease [1,2]. Approximately 3,500 people worldwide receive a transplant
every year [3–7]. As a result of improved immunosuppression, more refined surgical tech￾niques and precautions against post-transplant infections, the rates of survival for recipients of
lung transplantation are 80–85% after one year and 50–55% after five years [6–9].
Neurological complications arise in around 72% of lung transplant recipients [9–15]. Post￾transplant neurological complications after solid organ transplantation other than the lung are
also common, with an incidence ranging between 10% and 59% depending on the series and
the organ transplanted. For example, a third of patients undergoing liver transplants present
neurological complications [16–17]. These complications are also common in renal transplant
recipients, and contribute to morbidity and mortality [18]. Neurological complications occur
following heart transplantation in 50–70% of patients, mostly during the perioperative period
[19–20].
In lung recipients, serious complications involving the central nervous system (CNS) have
been the focus of study to date, and neurological problems affecting the peripheral and auto￾nomic nervous systems have until recently received little attention [21–23]. Although diseases
of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and the autonomic nervous system (ANS) have been
reported post-lung transplant, the incidence of clinical characteristics and the impact of the
neurological complications in the lung transplant population are generally unknown [13,24–
27]. We report here on CNS, PNS and ANS complications in a large cohort of lung transplant
recipients in a single institution in a two-year period.
Methods
Data collection
This is a retrospective cohort review reporting on the CNS, PNS and ANS concerns of 109
lung transplant recipients (66 men, 43 women) at a single institution over a two-year period
(between January 2013 and December 2014). We subsequently reviewed the medical records,
diagnostic imaging and electrophysiological investigations of all patients who underwent lung
transplantation. The neurological complications were classified in three groups: those affecting
the central nervous system (CNS), those affecting the peripheral nervous system (PNS), and
those affecting the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Phrenic injury and critical illness myop￾athy-neuropathy were evaluated by electrophysiological studies. Gastrointestinal complica￾tions were defined as previously reported [20]. The neurological complications were codified
according to the International Classification of Diseases (10th edition) [28]. The information
was obtained after approval by our institutional review board (IRB).
Statistical analysis
The data are presented as the mean, median, standard deviation, range and interquartile range
for the continuous variables, and counts and percentages for the categorical variables. The data
were compared between groups using the Student t test, the Mann–Whitney U test and the

Brunner-Munzel test (heteroscedastic data), analysis of variance (ANOVA), analysis of covari￾ance (ANCOVA) and the Kruskal-Wallis test by ranks, as appropriate for distribution normal￾ity. In the ANOVA and ANCOVA, log transformation was applied to the dependent variable
to improve normality in some cases.
The proportions of patients presenting neurological complications and other categorical
variables were compared using the chi-squared or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. The associ￾ation between the number of complications and the duration of surgery was studied with a
Poisson regression model. Cox proportional hazard models were used to test the univariate
associations between time-independent covariates, such as demographics, respiratory tests,
ischemic time and post-transplant survival.
A Mantel-Haenszel test was used to determine the contribution of neurological complica￾tions to survival time. Survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology.
We performed a multivariate Cox regression model to study the dependency of survival
time on predictor variables, including age at transplantation, uni- or bilateral transplant, ische￾mic times, total lung operating times, blood loss during surgery, use of ECMO and neurologi￾cal complications.
Statistical analysis was performed using the R computing environment (R Core Team,
2014). A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.
Ethics statement
This retrospective study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee (CREC) of
the Hospital Universitari Vall d’Hebron. None of the transplant donors were from a vulnerable
population. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the
study. Patient records/information was anonymized and de-identified prior to analysis. The
study was conducted according to the principles set out in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Results
Patient characteristics
One hundred and nine patients underwent lung transplantation during the study period. One
patient died within 24 hours of the transplant and was consequently excluded from the mor￾bidity analysis. There were no cases of re-transplant in our series.
The main characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Forty-three (39.8%) of the 108 patients
received single-lung transplantation via anterior thoracotomy through the fourth or fifth inter￾costal space. The transplant involved the left lung in 21 cases and the right lung in 22 cases.
The remaining sixty-five (60.2%) patients received a double lung transplant performed by
bilateral anterior thoracotomy and transverse sternotomy at the level of the fourth intercostal
space. The mean total duration of the surgery was 288.3 ± 80.5 minutes (median 285.0 min￾utes; range 145–580 minutes).
Twenty-seven patients (24.8%) died during the follow-up period. The mean survival time
among the patients who died was 177.6 days, with a median of 127 days and a range between 1
and 717 days. As the third quartile is 307.8 days, the data shows that 81.5% of those who died
did so within one year. The median of the total hospital stay for the 108 patients was 38 days,
with a median stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of 15.5 days.
Distribution of neurological complications and survival analysis
We identified neurological complications in 51 (47.2%) of the 108 patients. These neurological
complications are summarized in Table 2. Sixteen patients had one neurological complication,

Neurological complications in lung TX

9 had two neurological complications, 9 had three neurological complications, and 17 had four
or more neurological complications (68.6% of the patients had 2 or more complications). The
neurological complications were classified in three groups: those affecting the CNS, those
involving the PNS and those affecting the ANS. Two PNS disorders–critical illness polyneuro￾pathy/myopathy (31 cases) and phrenic nerve injury (26 cases)—were the most prevalent neu￾rological complications in our group of lung TX patients. Psychomotor agitation (n = 8),
cerebrovascular accident (stroke) (n = 5), encephalopathy (n = 2), and seizures (n = 2) were
the most common neurological complications involving the CNS, and the most common ANS
complication was gastroparesis, observed in 22 patients.
When we studied the estimated rate of survival for the 108 patients, we observed no signifi￾cant differences in terms of the effect of the variables sex, age, type of transplant and type of
pulmonary disease. The unadjusted survival rates were 90.83% at 3 months and 79.82% at 1
year. No differences were found between complicated and non-complicated rates (94.12% at 3
months and 76.47% at 1 year for complicated, 87.93% at 3 months and 82.76% at 1 year for
uncomplicated) (Fig 1).
Analysis of the effects of neurological complications on mortality (n = 26) showed that the
mean survival time in the group without any complications was 229.08 days, while among
those who had neurological complications, the survival time was 139.77 days. Although the
mean number of days until death is higher among those with no complications, the difference
is not significant, as there is a high level of variability in the death-time variable (p-value 0.21
using the Welch t-test). When we compared survival times between the group with complica￾tions and the group without any neurological complications, we found no dependency on any
of variables mentioned above. Survival was not dependent on the type of neurological compli￾cation (CNS, PNS or ANS).
Risk factors for neurological complications
When we investigated the existence of a correlation between all the variables and the risk of a
neurological complication, the patients at greatest risk of presenting neurological complica￾tions were those who had spent the most time in the operating theater, those requiring blood
transfusion (although this was not related to the number of pRBC required) and those with
longer ischemic times. The mean duration of surgery for cases with complications was
310.30 ± 76.1 minutes (median 315; range 180–580). The mean duration of surgery for cases
with no complications was 267.66 ± 79.6 minutes (median 261.5; range 145–425). (Wilcoxon
test W = 819.5; p-value = 0.01035). Although age was not observed to be a risk factor for

neurological complications, elderly patients were predisposed to multiple (4 or more) neuro￾logical complications (F = 3.117, p-value = 0.0348). Analysis of neurological complications by
group, according to whether they affect the CNS, PNS or ANS, also failed to identify risk
factors.
Characteristics and distribution of neurological complications
Most neurological complications appeared in the first two months (90.3%) post-transplant
(see Fig 2). Early neurological complications include phrenic nerve injury (with a mean post￾transplant latency of 9.7 ± 18.7 days), gastroparesis (13.1 ± 15.0 days), and seizures (23.5 ± 0.7
days), psychomotor agitation (13.1 ± 15.0 days), and stroke (30.2 ± 32.9 days). Critical illness
polyneuropathy/myopathy (48.5 ± 66.4 days) and tremor (46.5 ± 4.9 days) occur later.
When classified in groups, neurological complications affecting the PNS sometimes appear
within 30 days of transplant (39 versus 23) with a p-value = 0.024 for the Wilcoxon rank test
for true location at 30 days or less. Twelve cases of neurological complications affecting the
CNS occurred in the first month (versus 8 cases after 30 days; p-value = 0.32 for the Wilcoxon
rank test). There are also significant differences between the ANS and appearance more
than 30 days post-transplant (15 occurring within 30 days versus 6 occurring after 30 days,
p-value = 0.0008574 for the Wilcoxon rank test).
Hospital stays of lung recipients with neurological complications
The length of hospital stay (on the ward, in the ICU and total) was calculated for patients
with and without complications. The average length of time spent in hospital (for these 108
Fig 2. Post-transplant latencies (days) until appearance of neurological complications.

patients) was 50.01 ± 34.0 days (median 38; range 8–167), with a mean of 32.04 ± 35.6 days
(median 15.5; range 1–147) in the ICU, and 17.97 ± 12.6 days (median 16, range 0–65) in the
Thoracic Surgery Unit (ward) (see Table 3).
The presence of neurological complications was a risk factor for a longer total hospital stay
and a longer stay in the ICU. The average total length of hospital stay among the group without
any complications was 34.3 ± 20.6 days, versus 67.6 ± 37.4 days for the group with neurological
complications (Fig 3). The median for those without complications was 29 days, and for those
with complications it was 56 days (p-value = 3.072e-09 by Wilcoxon test). This longer period
for patients with neurological complications was due to a longer stay in the ICU. The average
total time spent in the ICU in the group without any complications was 16.4 ± 20.5 days, versus
49.5 ± 40.7 days for the group with neurological complications. The median for those without
complications was 8 days, and for those with complications it was 42 days (p-value = 3.392e-08
by the Wilcoxon test). No statistically significant differences for the stay on the thoracic sur￾gery ward were found in either group (p-value = 0.863).
An analysis of the total time spent in hospital among the group with neurological complica￾tions shows a correlation between the mean length of hospital stay and the number of compli￾cations, with the group with four or more complications admitted for the longest period of
time. Logarithmic transmission corrects the heteroscedasticity (p-value = 0.01647, Levene’s
test) of the dependent variable total hospital admission time. The ANOVA test between the
logarithm of the total time spent in hospital and the number of neurological complications is
thus significant (p-value = 0.000205). In short, there are significant differences depending on
the number and type of neurological complications experienced by the patient, which lengthen
the time spent in hospital.
Univariate and multivariate analysis
The univariate analysis performed includes gender, age at transplantation, type of transplant
(uni- or bipulmonary), BMI, ischemic time, total time of operation, blood loss during surgery,
use of ECMO, and all categories of neurological complication. Except for long operating times,
ischemic times and requirement for transfusion (but not the number of pRBC required), none
of the variables had a significant effect on the analysis.
The following variables were observed to be independent prognostic factors for neurologi￾cal complications: ischemic time (p = .023), with an HR of 1.00 and a 95% CI of 0.99 and 1.02,
the need for blood transfusion (p = .005), with an HR of 0.97 and a 95% CI of 0.41 and 2.31,
and longer operating times (p = .01), with an HR of 1.00 and a 95% CI of 0.99 and 1.01. Neither
age, gender, BMI spirometry, type of transplant (uni- or bilateral), ECMO nor the type of pul￾monary disease leading to the transplant were independent prognostic factors for neurological
complications.
In the multivariate Cox regression model to study the dependency of survival time, taking
sex, age, type of pulmonary disease, time spent in the ICU and time on the ward as regression
variables, only the variable “time on the ward” showed a significant association with survival

Discussion
Despite improvements in protocols for the screening, management and medical-surgical treat￾ment of recipients of lung transplantation, survival rates at 5 years do not exceed 60%.
Although a better selection of patients, the search for risk factors influencing the outcome,
improvement in pre-, per-, and postoperative techniques and the standardization of protocols
for procedures in both the operating theater and in the ICU have been proposed, the rates of
morbidity remain very high. There is evidence that long-term survival is directly related to
postoperative complications. Some of these complications, such as rejection and infections,
have been studied extensively [9, 29–30]. Interestingly, postoperative neurological complica￾tions in the outcome of lung transplants, and especially as a risk factor for a long stay in hospi￾tal, have not been studied in depth. This study aims to investigate the incidence of early
neurological complications affecting the CNS, PNS and ANP in a series of 108 lung trans￾plants, and whether their presence correlates with morbidity and prolonged hospital stays.
The incidence of patients with complications (51/108) is consistent with those described in
other retrospective series [11–13]. Recipients may present more than one neurological compli￾cation, with 68% of patients presenting two or more neurological complications in a two￾month period immediately after transplant. Despite the high incidence of neurological compli￾cations, they do not affect mortality. The rate of survival 12 months post-transplant is 81.5%, a
similar proportion to the figure reported at highly specialized lung transplantation centers.

Neurological complications in lung TX
PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0174092 March 16, 2017 9 / 14

Previous studies have analyzed the frequency of neurological complications, mainly focus￾ing on the CNS or on isolated neurological complications [9,12,13,22,23,25]. This explains
why the rate of neurological complications in lung transplantation recipients ranges between
11.5% and 66% [12,13,22,23,25]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the
entire spectrum of neurological complications after lung transplantation (i.e. those affecting
the CNS, PNS and ANS) has been investigated. However, it is not known whether other factors
apart from those mentioned could influence the inter-series variability of the frequencies
observed, and the main bias factor is probably that all the studies are retrospective. Most neu￾rological complications occur in the first two months post-transplant, have an impact on the
length of hospital stay, and on the length of stay in the ICU in particular. The difference in the
length of stay in the ICU between patients presenting complications and those who do not–
28.4 days–has a high financial cost and affects the recovery of lung transplant recipients. When
we investigated risk factors for neurological complications, we found no relationship between
the variables studied and possible neurological complications [13], including previous state
before surgery and drugs administered. Age at transplant, gender, and type of transplant (uni￾or bipulmonary) have been proposed as risk factors in previous series. We found that among
our patients with complications, older individuals presented the most complications, and
patients who had spent the most time in the operating theater were more likely to have compli￾cations, although these differences were not statistically significant.
Critical illness polyneuropathy/myopathy (CIP/CIM) was the most prevalent complication
(29.6%) in our study, with a median post-transplant latency of 35 days. To the best of our
knowledge, this neuromuscular complication has previously been described in only two stud￾ies. In the Pennsylvania series, only 4 of the 90 lung transplant recipients presented CIP/CIM
[13]. In the Minnesota series, of the 95 lung transplant patients who had at least one neurologi￾cal complication, 3 presented CIP/CIM [12]. Although the true incidence of CIP/CIM in lung
transplant recipients is unknown, it is very frequent among patients receiving mechanical ven￾tilation, transplant recipients, and those with severe pulmonary disorders, sepsis and burns
[31–36]. Some reviews suggest that it may occur in 46% [34–36]. Based on these reviews, our
findings and the average length of hospital stay after lung transplantation, the real incidence of
CIP/CIM in lung recipients is probably underestimated. Early identification of this complica￾tion seems wise in view of the impact of CIP/CIM on patients [37]. First, their weaning period
is significantly longer than in those without CIP/CIM, with a consequent longer stay in the
ICU and an increased likelihood of respiratory infections. Second, the muscle wasting and
weakness present in many of these patients with CIP/CIM leads to a significant functional lim￾itation when they are discharged from the ICU.
Phrenic nerve injury (PNI) was the second most frequently observed neurological complica￾tion in our series (23.8%). PNI, a potentially important cause of respiratory failure, was first
reported in 1963 in a group of four patients who underwent aortic valve replacement [37]. It
also occurs after lung transplantation and is generally secondary to phrenic nerve injury during
surgery. Its true incidence is unknown, and it was prospectively evaluated in patients with iso￾lated lung transplantation for the first time in 1995, with an incidence of 29.6% [25]. Subsequent
studies have found an incidence ranging from 2% to 90% [5,11,12,26,38–41]. Bilateral transplan￾tation and male gender were found to be risk factors for PNI in some series, although not in our
series. PNI has been considered the fourth most important complication of post-lung transplant
respiratory failure, after pulmonary edema, acute allograft rejection and pulmonary sepsis. This
complication usually appears in the first few days post-surgery, and lengthens the post-operative
stay in hospital by an average of one month. Another result of PNI is a lengthened UCI stay of
9.28 days (geometric mean). Intra-operative electrophysiological phrenic nerve monitoring is a
recommended measure for preventing damage to the phrenic nerve [42–46].

Encephalopathy, cerebrovascular accident (stroke), and seizures, in that order, were the
most frequent CNS complications. Our findings are similar to those reported in other adult
series. For example, in 2010 Mateen et al. found that the most common neurological complica￾tions in the CNS were strokes (12 patients), encephalopathy (29 patients), and seizures (7
patients) [12]. Strokes, and especially the hemorrhagic forms, are risk factors for mortality. Sei￾zures are the most common CNS complication in pediatric populations, occurring in 27% of
cases [11].
Neurogastroenterological complications were found in 24 patients. Gastroparesis was the
most common, in 22 cases. Gastroparesis following lung transplants—considered a neuro￾pathic disorder which alters the movement of food in the gastrointestinal tract—is common,
with an incidence of up to 95% of cases [24,27,47]. It has been attributed to preexisting lung
disease, intra-operative damage (inadvertent vagotomy or vagal injury during dissection of the
posterior mediastinum) and medications. For many authors, it is a surgical complication, espe￾cially when it appears during the first days post-transplant. Gastroparesis is particularly impor￾tant, as it affects the absorption of medication, delays correct oral nutrition and is a risk factor
for bronchoaspiration.
The weaknesses of our study are those common to most retrospective studies. They include
risk of bias, especially due to misclassification or selection, inter-rater variability, lack of con￾sistency in control over record keeping, and failure to measure other possible risk factors.
In short, neurological complications are common among lung transplant recipients and
their real incidence is very likely to have been underestimated. They usually appear in the first
two months after surgery. Although they do not affect mortality, they do affect the mean length
of hospital stay, and above all the time spent in the ICU. A significant number of patients pres￾ent more than three neurological complications. We found no risk factor for neurological
complications except for long operating times, ischemic times and requirement for transfusion
(but not the number of pRBC required). This study provides an analysis of a full spectrum
(CNS, PNS and ANS) of neurological complications after lung transplantation. Consensus
guidelines and recommendations are necessary to define the requirements for prevention and
early detection of neurological complications in patients scheduled to receive a lung transplant,
including intra-operative electrophysiological phrenic nerve monitoring and the presence of a
neurologist in multidisciplinary lung transplantation teams [45,46].
