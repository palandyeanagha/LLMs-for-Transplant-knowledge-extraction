Abstract
Introduction: Severe hyperkalemia, with potassium (K+
) levels ≥ 6.5 mEq/L, is a potentially life-threatening
electrolyte imbalance. For prompt and effective treatment, it is important to know its risk factors, clinical
manifestations, and predictors of mortality.
Methods: An observational cohort study was performed at 2 medical centers. A total of 923 consecutive Korean
patients were analyzed. All were 19 years of age or older and were hospitalized with severe hyperkalemia between
August 2007 and July 2010; the diagnosis of severe hyperkalemia was made either at the time of admission to the
hospital or during the period of hospitalization. Demographic and baseline clinical characteristics at the time of
hyperkalemia diagnosis were assessed, and clinical outcomes such as in-hospital mortality were reviewed, using the
institutions’ electronic medical record systems.
Results: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was the most common underlying medical condition, and the most
common precipitating factor of hyperkalemia was metabolic acidosis. Emergent admission was indicated in 68.6%
of patients, 36.7% had electrocardiogram findings typical of hyperkalemia, 24.5% had multi-organ failure (MOF) at
the time of hyperkalemia diagnosis, and 20.3% were diagnosed with severe hyperkalemia at the time of cardiac
arrest. The in-hospital mortality rate was 30.7%; the rate was strongly correlated with the difference between serum
K+ levels at admission and at their highest point, and with severe medical conditions such as malignancy, infection,
and bleeding. Furthermore, a higher in-hospital mortality rate was significantly associated with the presence of
cardiac arrest and/or MOF at the time of diagnosis, emergent admission, and intensive care unit treatment during
hospitalization. More importantly, acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with normal baseline renal function was a
strong predictor of mortality, compared with AKI superimposed on CKD.
Conclusions: Severe hyperkalemia occurs in various medical conditions; the precipitating factors are similarly diverse.
The mortality rate is especially high in patients with severe underlying disease, coexisting medical conditions, and
those with normal baseline renal function.
Introduction
Potassium (K+
) is a ubiquitous cation contained mostly
within the intracellular fluid; only about 2% of total body
K+ is found in the extracellular fluid [1]. In healthy
humans, serum K+ levels are tightly controlled within the
narrow range of 3.5 to 5.0 mEq/L [2], thus retaining a
normal ratio between the intracellular and extracellular
compartments. This homeostasis plays a critical role in
maintaining cellular resting membrane potential and
neuromuscular function and is essential for normal activ￾ity of muscles, nerves, and the heart [3]. Hyperkalemia,
resulting from an imbalance in K+ homeostasis, is defined
as a serum K+ level of greater than 5.0 mEq/L and is
further classified as mild, moderate, or severe [4,5]. It has
been reported that drug therapy and impaired renal func￾tion are the main factors predisposing to the develop￾ment of hyperkalemia [6-8].
Severe hyperkalemia (K+ of at least 6.5 mEq/L) is a
potentially life-threatening electrolyte disorder [9] that has
been reported to occur in 1% to 10% of all hospitalized
patients, a higher percentage than that seen in outpatients
[10,11]. It is associated with electrocardiogram (ECG)

abnormalities, including peaked T waves, shortened QT
intervals, prolonged PR intervals, reduction in the ampli￾tude of P waves, and ‘sine-wave’ ventricular rhythms with
wide QRS complexes. Severe hyperkalemia eventually
causes fatal arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation or
asystole, leading to cardiac arrest [12-15]. Severe hyperka￾lemia is a medical emergency and can lead to significant
morbidity and mortality; it therefore requires hospitaliza￾tion, ECG monitoring, and immediate treatment [16].
To promptly and effectively treat severe hyperkalemia,
it is important to know the risk factors, the clinical
manifestations, the therapeutic approaches, and the fac￾tors that predict both mortality and improvement in
this disorder [17-19]. Although most of these factors are
well documented, reliable predictors of clinical out￾comes such as in-hospital mortality have not been
established. We therefore designed this study to identify
common factors predisposing to severe hyperkalemia
and to analyze the relationship between serum K+ levels
and clinical outcomes, including in-hospital mortality.
Furthermore, we attempted to determine the association
between in-hospital mortality and multiple clinical fac￾tors in patients with severe hyperkalemia.
Materials and methods
Study population
This observational cohort study was performed in two
medical centers during a 3-year period. The institutions
involved were Seoul National University Hospital (Seoul,
Korea) and Seoul National University Boramae Medical
Center (Seoul, Korea), which are tertiary referral hospitals
with 1,600 and 800 beds, respectively, and an academic
affiliation with Seoul National University College of Medi￾cine. Using the electronic medical record system, we iden￾tified the population of hospitalized patients at these
centers between August 2007 and July 2010; we enrolled
patients at or over the age of 19 years who had at least
one severe hyperkalemic event, with serum K+ levels of at
least 6.5 mEq/L. In patients who had several of these
events, the first event was used for analysis. All cases of
severe hyperkalemia were diagnosed either at the time of
admission to the hospital or during the period of hospitali￾zation. This study was approved by the institutional review
boards of both hospitals; the need for informed consent
was waived because of the study’s retrospective design. All
clinical investigations were conducted in accordance with
the guidelines of the 2008 Declaration of Helsinki.
Data collection
Detailed evaluations of hospitalizations, prescriptions, and
laboratory findings were performed for all identified patients
by using the electronic medical record systems of the insti￾tutions. Data, including patients’ medical histories, comor￾bid diseases, medications, coexisting medical conditions,
ECG findings, and hyperkalemia management strategies,
were abstracted from admission records, progress records,
nursing records, discharge summaries, and the records of
the emergency department and the intensive care unit
(ICU). The type of admission and the timing of the onset of
hyperkalemia were reviewed; in patients with hospital￾acquired hyperkalemia, the period from admission to diag￾nosis and the hospital location at diagnosis were also
reviewed. The symptoms associated with hyperkalemia and
the occurrence of multi-organ failure (MOF) or cardiac
arrest (or both) at the time of severe hyperkalemia diagnosis
were examined closely.
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was classified into five
groups on the basis of the estimated glomerular filtration
rate (eGFR): normal renal function and stage I CKD,
eGFR of at least 90 mL/minute per 1.73 m2
; stage II, eGFR
of 60 to 89 mL/minute per 1.73 m2
; stage III, eGFR of 30
to 59 mL/minute per 1.73 m2
; stage IV, eGFR of 15 to
29 mL/minute per 1.73 m2
; and stage V, eGFR of less than
15 mL/minute per 1.73 m2 or requiring renal replacement
therapy (RRT). Patients with a previous diagnosis of severe
hyperkalemia were considered to have recurrent severe
hyperkalemia. Hypertension was defined as a systolic
blood pressure of greater than 140 mm Hg or a diastolic
pressure of greater than 90 mm Hg or by the use of anti￾hypertensive drugs. Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in
patients with a random blood glucose concentration of
greater than 200 mg/dL, a fasting plasma glucose level of
greater than 126 mg/dL on at least two separate occasions,
or a glycated hemoglobin of greater than 7.0% or by the
use of oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin. Cirrhosis was
defined by computed tomography or sonography, and
congestive heart failure was defined as a New York Heart
Association functional class III or IV. Coronary artery dis￾ease was defined by a prior diagnosis of ischemic heart dis￾ease and positive ECG findings; pulmonary diseases
included tuberculosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary dis￾ease, and asthma.
We identified prescriptions for the most common medi￾cations that are capable of increasing serum K+ levels:
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II
receptor blockers, potassium-sparing diuretics, beta block￾ers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, digoxin, and
potassium supplements. These medications were consid￾ered potentially contributory if administered within 24 to
36 hours of the onset of hyperkalemia; if patients were
already on dialysis, these medications were considered
noncontributory.
Coexisting medical conditions affecting the occurrence
of severe hyperkalemia were categorized into one of three
groups: those causing renal impairment, those causing K+
shift across cell membranes, and others. The initial cate￾gorization was performed by electronic medical record
review and confirmed on the basis of the clinical judgment

of the researchers. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was defined
by the Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria and consisted
of an absolute increase in serum creatinine of at least
0.3 mg/dL, a percentage increase in the serum creatinine of
at least 50%, and/or a reduction in urine output, defined as
an output of less than 0.5 mL/kg per hour for greater than
6 hours; these changes were required to occur over a rapid
time course (< 48 hours) to meet the definition of AKI
[20,21]. The diagnosis of infection required not only at least
two signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome but
also clinical evidence of infection. Volume depletion was
defined as a clinical situation resulting from decreased
effective circulating volume and total extracellular fluid
volume or as decreased effective circulating volume with
increased total extracellular fluid volume. Bleeding was
defined as class II or higher hemorrhage on the basis of
Advanced Trauma Life Support guidelines, or grade 2 or
higher hemorrhage on the basis of World Health Organiza￾tion guidelines, with definite clinical signs and symptoms.
Metabolic acidosis was defined as an arterial pH of less
than 7.35. Poor compliance with K+
-lowering agents was
determined by review of the attending physician’s records,
including the patient’s medical history, and the reviewer’s
judgment.
When available, ECGs corresponding to the time of
severe hyperkalemia diagnosis or those nearest in time to
the diagnosis were reviewed and compared with baseline
ECGs. The existence of ECG findings typical of severe
hyperkalemia, or an alteration in ECG findings compared
with previous results, was considered a ‘change in ECG
findings’. The findings considered typical of severe hyper￾kalemia were tall T waves, shortening of QT intervals,
prolonged PR intervals, reductions in the amplitude of
P waves, ‘sine-wave’ ventricular rhythms with wide QRS
complexes, and the occurrences of ventricular fibrillation
and asystole. Decisions on ECG findings were based on
formal readings, documented by the attending cardiolo￾gist, and adjudicated by reviewers and researchers on the
basis of an extensive literature review [14,22-24]. The
period from the diagnosis of hyperkalemia to ‘change in
ECG findings’ was also recorded.
Management of severe hyperkalemia was divided into a
conservative management group and an aggressive man￾agement group; patients requiring RRT were in the aggres￾sive management group. The choice of RRT modality was
made by the attending physician after considering the clini￾cal characteristics of each patient. The criteria for initiation
of RRT in AKI included volume overload, oliguria, acidosis,
refractory hyperkalemia, and uremic symptoms or docu￾mented uremia. We categorized management techniques
into ‘level of support I’ and ‘level of support II’ categories.
‘Level of support I’ contained seven initial conservative
management strategies, all given a weight of 1: drug
cessation, intravenous (IV) calcium gluconate, dextrose
fluid with insulin, IV or oral (PO) sodium bicarbonate, cal￾cium polystyrene sulfonate enema, PO calcium polystyrene
sulfonate, and IV or PO loop diuretics. The sum of
weighted values was defined as the ‘level of support I’ value
for each patient. ‘Level of support II’ contained nine initial
conservative management strategies and RRT treatments:
the previously named seven strategies were included with
the addition of hemodialysis (weight 1) and continuous
renal replacement therapy (CRRT) (weight 2). The sum of
weighted values was defined as the ‘level of support II’
value for each patient.
Clinical parameters that could influence either the
development of severe hyperkalemia or in-hospital mor￾tality - serum creatinine, eGFR, total carbon dioxide, and
arterial pH level - were documented. All laboratory data
were collected from the time that the serum K+ level
reached at least 6.5 mEq/L. Serum creatinine levels were
measured by using an assay based on the Jaffe method,
and eGFR was calculated by using the following abbre￾viated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula:
GFR (in mL/minute per 1.73 m2
) = 186 × (serum creati￾nine) 1.154 × (age in years)-0.203 × (0.742 if female).
Clinical outcomes
Clinical outcomes included ICU treatment (including
reasons for ICU treatment), cardiopulmonary resuscita￾tion (CPR), improvement in severe hyperkalemia, and
in-hospital mortality (including reasons for in-hospital
mortality). Improvement in hyperkalemia was defined as
a serum K+ level of less than 5.5 mEq/L, independent of
deterioration in clinical condition or in-hospital mortal￾ity. In-hospital mortality was defined as death during the
period of hospitalization, independent of an improve￾ment in severe hyperkalemia.
Statistical analysis
Categorical variables were described as the frequency and
proportion of variables and were compared by using the
chi-square test. Continuous variables were expressed as
the mean ± standard deviation and compared by using a
Student t test after normality testing. A simple logistic
regression model was used to determine the unadjusted
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
A correlation analysis was conducted in order to avoid
multi-collinearity; only one variable in highly correlated
variable sets was selected for multiple logistic regression
analysis. Statistically significant covariables from univariate
analysis and clinically important covariables were included
in the final multiple logistic regression model, conducted
in a forward stepwise manner. The end results of multiple
logistic regression analysis were demonstrated as a forest
plot. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically

significant. Statistical analysis was performed with the Sta￾tistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 18.0K
(SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Demographic and clinical baseline characteristics
We identified 282,832 patients hospitalized at one of the
two medical centers between August 2007 and July 2010
(Figure 1). Severe hyperkalemia was diagnosed in a total of
1,803 consecutive patients at least 19 years old. Patients
were excluded from analysis if laboratory errors such as
hemolysis were present (279 patients), if they had clinical
conditions causing pseudohyperkalemia (150 patients), if
they were admitted only for palliative care or had docu￾mented ‘do not resuscitate’ (DNR) status (391 patients), or
if they were end-stage renal disease patients admitted for
planned RRT (24 patients) or other procedures (36
patients). Thus, 923 patients were enrolled in this study.
The demographic and clinical baseline characteristics at
the time of severe hyperkalemia diagnosis are shown in
Table 1. Of the 923 patients, 586 (63.5%) were male and
the mean age was approximately 61 years. The mean
serum K+ levels at admission and at the time of severe
hyperkalemia diagnosis were 5.7 ± 1.5 mEq/L and 7.1 ± 0.7
mEq/L, respectively. Emergent admission was required in
68.6% of patients: 10.1% were admitted for severe hyperka￾lemia, and the remaining 89.9% were hospitalized for other
causes, including non-severe hyperkalemia; the most com￾mon reason for admission was infection. Hyperkalemia
occurred during the hospital course in 60.0% of patients;
40% of cases had an onset prior to admission. In those
diagnosed during admission, the period from admission to
diagnosis was approximately 17 days, and the most com￾mon hospital location at severe hyperkalemia diagnosis was
the medical ward. Symptomatic patients accounted for
46.8% of those with severe hyperkalemia; the most com￾mon symptom was cardiac arrest, followed by arrhythmia
and muscle weakness. MOF was present in 24.5% of
patients at the time of hyperkalemia diagnosis, and 20.3%
had cardiac arrest at the time of diagnosis.
CKD was the most common underlying disease, and
angiotensin II receptor blockers were the most common
medications. AKI was a coexisting condition in 205
patients (22.2%) with normal baseline renal function and
478 patients (51.8%) with underlying CKD. In addition,
50.4% of all patients who underwent ECG demonstrated
changes pertinent to severe hyperkalemia; the period from
diagnosis with hyperkalemia to ‘change in ECG findings’
was approximately 22 minutes, and the most common
findings were asystole and pulseless electrical activity.
Severe hyperkalemia management and clinical outcomes
Calcium gluconate was used in 58.1% of patients, dextrose
fluid mixed with insulin in 52.7%, and 38.4% received
sodium bicarbonate (Table 2). Hyperkalemia-causing
drugs were discontinued in 219 patients (23.7%). RRT was
fairly common; 176 patients (19.1%) underwent hemodia￾lysis and 71 (7.7%) received CRRT. The levels of support
offered to patients are described in Additional file 1.
The lower part of Table 2 summarizes clinical outcomes
during hospitalization. ICU treatment was required in 126
patients (13.7%), and the most common reason for ICU
admission was respiratory compromise, followed by the
need for hemodynamic intensive monitoring and septic
shock. CPR was administered for issues related to severe
hyperkalemia in 60 patients (6.5%); 232 patients (25.1%)
had CPR for other reasons. Severe hyperkalemia improved
in 715 patients (77.5%), and a total of 283 patients (30.7%)
died. The most common reason for in-hospital mortality
was septic shock, followed by respiratory and cardiac
issues.
As shown in Additional file 2, patients diagnosed at the
time of cardiac arrest and those with MOF at the time of
diagnosis had lower improvement rates than those who
did not have these complications at the time of diagnosis.
We also analyzed the association of the level of support
offered to patients and their clinical outcomes, including
improvement in hyperkalemia and in-hospital mortality
(Table 3). Higher values for the level of support, in both
categories I and II, were significantly associated with
improvement in hyperkalemia. The value for level of sup￾port I was higher in the survival group than the in-hospital
mortality group; level of support II value was not asso￾ciated with in-hospital mortality. In other words, aggres￾sive initial treatments resulted in improvement of
hyperkalemia and higher survival rate. In patients receiv￾ing even RRT with initial treatments, hyperkalemia
improved; however, in-hospital mortality was not affected.
Association between in-hospital mortality and clinical
factors
Tables 4 and 5 show the comparison between the survi￾val group and the in-hospital mortality group, and the
association of clinical factors, both modifiable and non￾modifiable, with in-hospital mortality. The OR for mor￾tality increased as the levels of the following modifiable
factors increased: the serum K+ level and the difference
between serum K+ levels at admission and at its highest
point. Severe medical conditions, including infection,
volume depletion, and bleeding, were significantly asso￾ciated with a higher mortality rate. Furthermore, the
development of AKI in patients with normal baseline
renal function was a clear predictor of a higher mortality
rate (OR 5.23, 95% CI 3.75 to 7.30; P < 0.001). In con￾trast, the mortality rate decreased in patients with AKI
superimposed on CKD (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.70; P
< 0.001). These findings are demonstrated in Table 6,
which evaluates the mortality rate in patients with AKI

according to the presence or absence of underlying CKD.
Patients with AKI superimposed on CKD had much
lower mortality rates than those with AKI developing
from normal baseline renal function (OR 0.42, 95% CI
0.23 to 0.74; P = 0.003) (Table 6). Patients who received
CPR had much higher mortality rates than those who did
not; in particular, CPR significantly increased the mortal￾ity rate when performed for causes other than those
related to hyperkalemia. ICU treatment during hospitali￾zation was also significantly associated with higher
in-hospital mortality.
With respect to drug-induced hyperkalemia, the in￾hospital mortality rate was lower for those receiving
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II
receptor blockers, beta blockers, K+
-sparing diuretics,
and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (Table 5).

Moreover, a higher value for level of support I, indicating
aggressive initial treatment, was associated with a lower
mortality rate (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.99; P = 0.020).
Improvement in hyperkalemia also markedly lowered in￾hospital mortality (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.12; P <
0.001).
Of the non-modifiable factors, male gender and underly￾ing malignancy were significant risk factors for higher in￾hospital mortality. The mortality rate was lower, however,
in patients with diabetes, hypertension, and a history of
recurrent severe hyperkalemia. As CKD progressed to
higher stages, the OR of in-hospital mortality decreased:
stage II, OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.78; P = 0.002; stage III,
OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.46; P < 0.001; stage IV, OR 0.13,
95% CI 0.06 to 0.26; P < 0.001; stage V, OR 0.17, 95% CI
0.11 to 0.27; P < 0.001. Age and underlying congestive
heart failure did not influence in-hospital mortality.
The in-hospital mortality rate was strongly correlated
with ECG changes pertinent to hyperkalemia, MOF at
admission, and emergent admission (OR 4.29, 95% CI
2.87 to 6.10; P < 0.001). The factors of hospital-acquired
hyperkalemia, presence of MOF at the time of diagnosis,
diagnosis at the time of cardiac arrest, and cardiac arrest
as a symptom of hyperkalemia were also significantly
associated with higher in-hospital mortality.
Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that
malignancy and the precipitating conditions of new-onset
AKI, infection, and bleeding were strong risk factors for
in-hospital mortality. Furthermore, it was verified that in￾hospital mortality increased significantly as the difference
between serum K+ levels at admission and its highest
levels increased. Emergent admission, the presence of
MOF at the time of diagnosis, cardiac arrest as a symp￾tom of hyperkalemia, and ICU care during hospitalization
were also associated with a higher mortality rate. In con￾trast, the mortality rate was lower in patients with drug￾induced hyperkalemia (Figure 2).
Discussion

predisposing to severe hyperkalemia and to analyze the

investigated the association between in-hospital mortal￾ity and multiple clinical factors in patients with severe
hyperkalemia.
Severe hyperkalemia was shown to result from various
medical conditions, predisposing factors, and medications.
Despite appropriate and aggressive management, the in￾hospital mortality was very high (30.7%). The meaningful

treatment for severe hyperkalemia resulted in improve￾ment of K+ values and consequently lowered the in-hospi￾tal mortality rate.
The results of the present study correspond well with
those of earlier studies which reported that angiotensin￾converting enzyme inhibitors, K+
-sparing diuretics, non￾steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and K+ supplements
are associated with an increased incidence of hyperkale￾mia [25,26]. In addition, our results agree with several
published studies that factors such as diabetes, congestive
heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and metabolic acidosis may
contribute to the development of hyperkalemia [27-30].
The association between renal impairment and hyperka￾lemia is well documented [31-33]. Our findings are con￾sistent with those of prior studies indicating that the
mortality rate in patients with hyperkalemia increases as
the serum K+ level increases [34,35]. Additionally, the
finding that most cases resulting in death are complicated
by other medical conditions such as renal failure and
metabolic acidosis is supported by the present study [34].
The results of our study coincide well with those of
Evans and colleagues [36], showing that ECG changes
that are more severe, such as cardiac arrest, are asso￾ciated with greater degrees of hyperkalemia and with a
higher mortality rate.
The present study has a different level of significance
compared with other studies, as we demonstrated a nega￾tive association between baseline renal function and in￾hospital mortality. Whereas the development of AKI
superimposed on CKD was associated with a better prog￾nosis, the occurrence of AKI in patients with normal
baseline renal function conferred an increased mortality
rate and a poorer prognosis. Similarly, in the group of
patients without AKI, the in-hospital mortality rate was
higher in patients without underlying CKD. Patients with

CKD are exposed to hyperkalemia over a long period of
time, and thus the normal range of serum K+ levels in
such patients should be considered higher than in other
patients; an ability to adapt to an imbalance in the serum
K+ level may be acquired, making the clinical manifesta￾tions of severe hyperkalemia, and its outcomes, relatively
mild and less harmful.
In the same vein, a large number of patients with under￾lying diabetes and hypertension had renal insufficiency,
and their mortality rate during the period of hospitalization
tended to be lower than that of other patients. Similarly,
patients taking offending drugs had baseline renal impair￾ment, and thus the mortality rate appeared to decrease.

acute kidney injury (AKI), infection, and bleeding were strongly associated with in-hospital mortality. The mortality rate increased significantly as
the difference in serum K+ level at admission and at its highest point (serum K+ ≥ 6.5 mEq/L) increased. In contrast, the mortality rate decreased
in patients with drug-induced hyperkalemia, including those who used beta blockers. CI, confidence interval.

with AKI developing from normal baseline renal function,
because of a lack of ability of these patients to adapt to
higher serum K+ levels.
We also demonstrated that the severe medical conditions
of infection and bleeding, accompanying hyperkalemia,
increased the mortality rate; these findings had clear signif￾icance after adjustment for serum K+ levels. The typical
ECG changes and symptoms pertinent to hyperkalemia,
particularly cardiac arrest, were shown to be associated
with a higher mortality rate as well. Death of patients with
severe hyperkalemia was not attributable solely to the
severity of the hyperkalemia but to the severity of the coex￾isting medical conditions. Supporting these findings, the
presence of MOF at hyperkalemia diagnosis and the need
for emergent admission or ICU treatment (or for both)
were strongly correlated with an increased mortality rate.
These factors were independently associated with the
severity of the accompanying clinical situation rather than
with the severe hyperkalemia itself.
There are several limitations in our study. First, the entire
study population was hospitalized and diagnosed with
severe hyperkalemia; there was no control group. It is there￾fore impossible to compare various characteristics between
our patients and those with normal K+ levels. Second, there
is a potentially inherent bias resulting from the fact that
only attending physicians evaluated the patients and classi￾fied the diverse clinical situations. Although researchers
examined and reviewed the data from the electronic medical
record in an attempt to minimize bias, inevitable limitations
exist. Third, this study was based upon the premise that all
patients, except those with DNR status, received equally
effective treatment for other conditions such as infection,
volume depletion, and bleeding; we did not verify all treat￾ments offered to all patients. Hence, the association between
treatments not related to hyperkalemia and clinical out￾comes was not verified. Fourth, it was difficult to identify
accurately the drugs that caused severe hyperkalemia, as
most patients took a number of prescribed medications
concurrently. Fifth, the ECG changes described could also
have resulted from severe acidosis and myocardial ischemia.
For this reason, it was difficult to estimate whether ECG
changes were due to severe hyperkalemia alone. Finally, the
present study was retrospective in nature, using only an
electronic medical record system, and thus some essential
information was often unavailable and the subjective opi￾nions and decisions of the researcher became involved in
data collection and analysis. Our retrospective study also
may have inherent confounders for mortality, compromis￾ing our ability to identify a causal relationship between var￾ious clinical factors and the in-hospital mortality rate.
Accordingly, well-designed, multicenter, prospective, large
cohort studies should be conducted to verify the implica￾tions of numerous predisposing factors involving medica￾tions, comorbidities, and concurrent medical conditions.
These future studies should also evaluate the role of differ￾ent treatments in reducing mortality.
Conclusions
Severe hyperkalemia, requiring hospitalization and
prompt treatment, occurs in patients with diverse medi￾cal conditions; precipitating factors also vary. The mor￾tality rate increases in patients with greater differences
between the admission and highest serum K+ levels, in
patients with MOF or cardiac arrest (or both) at the time
of hyperkalemia diagnosis, in those with severe underly￾ing diseases, in those with coexisting medical conditions,
and in those who develop AKI from normal baseline
renal function, as opposed to those with underlying
CKD, with or without AKI.
Consequently, controlling and maintaining the serum
K+ level within a safe range have great importance in the
clinical setting. Determining additional risk factors for
severe hyperkalemia may be valuable and instructive to
clinicians in the identification of high-risk patients and in
the effective management of severe hyperkalemia.
Key messages
• Severe hyperkalemia occurs with diverse precipitat￾ing factors in patients with various medical conditions.
• An increased in-hospital mortality rate is signifi￾cantly associated with severe underlying disease and
coexisting medical conditions as well as with severe
hyperkalemia itself.
• More importantly, the mortality rate is higher in
patients with normal baseline renal function than in
those with underlying CKD.
Additional material
Additional file 1: Level of Support Offered to Patients Diagnosed
with Severe Hyperklaemia. We categorized management techniques
into ‘level of support I’ and ‘level of support II’ categories. ‘Level of
support I’ contained 7 initial conservative management strategies, all
given a weight of 1: drug cessation; intravenous (IV) calcium gluconate;
dextrose fluid with insulin; IV or oral (PO) sodium bicarbonate; calcium
polystyrene sulfonate enema; PO calcium polystyrene sulfonate; and IV or
PO loop diuretics. The sum of weighted values was defined as the ‘level
of support I’ value for each patient. ‘Level of support II’ contained 9 initial
conservative management strategies and RRT treatments: the previously
named 7 strategies were included, with the addition of hemodialysis
(weight 1); and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) (weight 2).
The sum of weighted values was defined as the ‘level of support II’ value
for each patient. The levels of support offered to patients are described
in Additional file 1.
Additional file 2: Association between improvement in severe
hyperkalemia and deterioration occurring at the time of diagnosis.
Patients diagnosed at the time of cardiac arrest, and those with MOF at
the time of diagnosis, had lower improvement rates than those who did
not have these complications at the time of diagnosis. Furthermore,
improvement in hyperkalemia also markedly lowered in-hospital
mortality.
