Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coro￾navirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for 
the current global pandemic of COVID￾19, which is associated with significant 
morbidity and mortality.1
 As of 26 April 
2020, it has infected over three million 
people worldwide and caused more than 
200 000 deaths.2
 Chronic liver diseases 
from HCV, HBV, alcoholism or non￾alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) 
represent a major disease burden in the 
world. Around 1.5 billion people have 
chronic liver diseases worldwide, and 
it causes around two million deaths per 
year. While self-resolving elevations of 
transaminases are reported in 15%–54% 
of patients with COVID-19, those with 
more severe disease experience worse 
liver injury.3–5 An open international 
registry, SECURE-Cirrhosis, is reporting 
a mortality rate of 40% among the 118 
patients with cirrhosis.6
 Thus, patients 
with chronic liver disease represent a 
vulnerable population who are at higher 
risk of acquiring COVID-19 and suffering 
from its complications.7 8
International societies, including the 
American Association for the Study of 
Liver Diseases (AASLD),9
 the European 
Association for the Study of the Liver 
(EASL),10 the International Liver Cancer 
Association (ILCA),11 the Gastroentero￾logical Society of Australia, The Trans￾plantation Society (TTS),12 the American 
Society of Transplantation Surgeons,13 and 
the Liver Transplant Society of India,14
have released guidance to aid physicians 
taking care of patients with chronic liver 
diseases and liver transplantation. Most 
of these recommendations are based 
on expert consensus, as rigorous data 
are not yet available. We compare these 
major international recommendations 
and discuss a consolidated approach to 
managing liver disease in the setting of 
COVID-19. We also share our views on 
the path towards the eventual transition 
back to normality.
Recommendations for inpatient care of 
chronic liver disease during COVID-19
Patients with liver diseases continue 
to require hospitalisation during the 
pandemic both for COVID-related and 
liver-related indications, and attempts 
should be made to minimise their risk of 
contracting COVID-19.15 Both AASLD 
and EASL recommend infection preven￾tion and control measures that include the 
cohorting of inpatients with COVID-19 
from other non-infected patients and maxi￾mising the use of telemedicine to reduce 
contact between patients and healthcare 
workers 9 10 (figure 1). EASL recommends 
considering early admission for patients 
with COVID-19 with advanced liver 
disease, especially in the presence of other 
risk factors. Patients with COVID-19 and 
elevated liver biochemistries should be 
evaluated for coexisting viral hepatitis and 
complications, including myositis, isch￾aemia and cytokine release syndrome.10
Additionally, liver biochemistries should 
be regularly monitored, especially for 
those treated with novel antiviral drugs 
like remdesivir or tocilizumab. Diagnostic 
imaging should only be performed in 
patients with strong clinical suspicion of 
deep venous thrombosis or biliary obstruc￾tion. Both EASL 10 and AASLD suggest 
that liver biopsies should be deferred in 
most patients, but do acknowledge that 
biopsies may be needed in some cases to 
rule out acute rejection or diagnose acute 
autoimmune hepatitis. In the coming 
weeks, as the number of COVID-19 
cases decrease, we expect a second surge 
of patients with hepatic decompensation 
and other liver-related complications to 
require hospitalisation. Some of the steps 
that hospitals could take now to handle 
this surge include maximising hospital bed 
capacity, optimising personal protective 
equipment (PPE) availability and mobil￾ising healthcare workers.
Recommendations for outpatient care of 
chronic liver disease during COVID-19
The major international recommenda￾tions outline basic mitigation principles 
which generally apply to all patients with 
chronic liver disease being managed in 
the outpatient setting.9 10 16 They empha￾sise the need to limit in-person outpa￾tient visits and recommend phone visits 
or telemedicine as an alternative wher￾ever possible. Recommendations suggest 
that medications should preferentially be 
delivered using mail services, and lab tests 
should be performed at local laboratories 
instead of hospitals. AASLD recommends 
in-person new patient visits only for those 
with significant liver disease, such as jaun￾dice, elevated transaminases of >500 U/L 
or recent decompensation. During such 
in-person visits, appropriate PPE should 
be used. AASLD also specifically states 
that patients with COVID-19 symptoms 
or known exposure should not be evalu￾ated in the hepatology clinic but rather in 
designated COVID-19 clinics.
Recommendations for specific liver 
diseases
For patients with viral hepatitis B or C, 
both AASLD and EASL suggest continuing 
ongoing antiviral treatment. For patients 
with HCV who need to be initiated on 
therapy, EASL specifically recommends 
pursuing non-invasive evaluation of 
fibrosis instead of biopsy. AASLD takes a 
slightly different approach and suggests 
considering delaying the initiation of 
direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy 
when possible, likely to avoid the need 
for repeated clinic and lab visits. Patients 
with alcoholic liver disease may be 
particularly vulnerable to relapse during 
the pandemic, since in-person support

groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous 
(AA) are not available. AASLD recom￾mends offering these patients either tele￾phone or online resources. Patients with 
NAFLD usually suffer from comorbid 
conditions such as diabetes, hypertension 
or obesity,10 putting them at an increased 
risk of progression to severe COVID-1917; 
hence, mitigation efforts are particularly 
crucial in this population. Patients with 
autoimmune hepatitis who are on immu￾nosuppressants should generally continue 
treatment except in cases of severe 
COVID-19, lymphopaenia or superinfec￾tion, where reduction of immunosuppres￾sion might be necessary. To summarise, 
the current recommendations for patients 
with chronic compensated liver disease are 
quite similar: to stay calm, stay home and 
continue their current regimen. However, 
the larger questions about reopening care 
for these patients still remain: When is it 
a good time to initiate DAA for HCV if 
it had been postponed? When should we 
resume elective procedures like transient 
elastography? When do we restart clinical 
trial enrolment for non-alcoholic fatty 
liver disease (NAFLD) and other chronic 
liver diseases? How can we help patients 
get back to support services like AA? We 
hope there will be specific guidance to 
answer these questions in the near future.
Liver transplantation and COVID-19
COVID-19 adds another layer of 
complexity to the care of patients who 
are either awaiting or have already under￾gone liver transplantation. While making 
decisions regarding transplantation, one 
has to now consider resource prudence 
not only in the context of organ use but 
also in terms of availability of intensie care 
unit (ICU) beds, transplant staff and blood 
products (online supplementary table 
1). Some societies like TTS recommend 
completely halting deceased donor liver 
transplantation programmes in regions 
of widespread COVID-19 prevalence, 
particularly in low-resource settings,12
while most other societies have advocated 
for limiting transplantation to patients 
with acute liver failure, high MELD (20 or 
above) or HCC close to the limits of Milan 
criteria.9 10 14 Although AASLD recom￾mends stopping almost all living donor 
liver transplantation (LDLT), EASL as well 
as societies from India and China recom￾mend continuing LDLT on a case-by-case 
basis.9 10 14 18 There will be long-term 
and profound implications of completely 
suspending transplant activity; hence, 
blanket guidelines should pave the way for 
more granular recommendations based on 
the principles of safety and priority.
Given that the risk of transmission from 
donors is not well known, most societies 
recommend avoiding organs from COVID￾19-positive donors.10 19 Though there 
are no reported cases of donor-derived 
coronavirus infection, SARS-CoV-2 
viraemia is found in approximately 15% 
of cases20; hence, most societies recom￾mend screening all donors for possible 
exposure and/or symptoms.9
 The Cana￾dian and Japanese Society of Transplan￾tation give specific recommendations to 
employ plans to risk stratify or isolate 
donors for a long-enough duration to 
minimise donor-related transmission of 
SARS-CoV-2.21 22 AASLD recommends 
against transplanting COVID-19-positive 
recipients.9
 Hence, patients on top of the 
list should be screened for COVID-19 
and the possibility of false negative tests 
should be considered before proceeding 
with the transplant.
Whether post-transplant patients are 
at increased risk of COVID-19 is not 
known. In a recent report from Italy, 
deaths were noted in patients who had 
a remote history of transplant and were 
on minimal immunosuppression, while 
the immediate post-transplant patients 
fared better.23 This is in contrast to data 
from an international registry, SECURE￾Cirrhosis, which shows that all four deaths 
in their cohort occurred in patients who 
had undergone transplant within the past 
2 years.24 These contradictory reports 
clearly highlight the need for more robust 
data. For now, all major societies have 
recommended against routine reduction 
of immunosuppression in post-transplant 
patients.9 10 14 18 If a patient tests positive 
for COVID-19, the dose of steroids should 
be decreased to a minimum to avoid 
adrenal insufficiency.9 10 18 In patients who 
are 6 months or more post-transplant 
and develop fever, lymphopaenia and/or 
worsening pneumonia, it is recommended 
to reduce or stop azathioprine and myco￾phenolate and to consider reducing, 
but not stopping, calcineurin inhibitors

(CNI).9 10 18 Another important issue to 
watch out for are drug–drug interactions 
in patients infected with COVID-19 who 
will undergo various treatments. Drug 
levels of CNI and mammalian Target Of 
Rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors should be 
closely monitored when they are adminis￾tered together with drugs such as hydroxy￾chloroquine or azithromycin.25
More than ever, the decision to trans￾plant or not requires a multidisciplinary 
approach with input from local health 
officials. The dilemma between allocating 
resources for transplant versus saving PPE 
and ICU beds for patients with COVID-19 
is a major one and is best answered locally 
based on available resources and prevalence 
of disease. Overall, while the direct impact 
of COVID-19 on transplant patients is not 
known, we expect it to be indirectly detri￾mental by leading to decrease in organ avail￾ability and increase in waitlist mortality.26
Endoscopy in patients with liver disease 
during COVID-19 pandemic
All GI and endoscopy societies suggest 
deferring non-urgent endoscopies.27–30
Only urgent procedures for life-threatening 
conditions such as acute GI bleeding like 
variceal haemorrhage, oesophageal food 
impaction and endoscopic retrograde 
cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) for 
acute cholangitis should be undertaken. 
For variceal screening, EASL recommends 
performing risk assessments, such as 
applying the Baveno VI criteria, whereas 
AASLD goes even further to suggest 
primary prophylaxis with beta blockers 
instead of screening endoscopy in patients 
with clinically significant portal hyperten￾sion or high risk of decompensation. EASL 
suggests that ERCP for dilatation or stent 
replacement in postliver transplantation 
or primary sclerosing cholangitis should 
be performed after careful risk–benefit 
considerations. In addition, upper GI 
endoscopy is considered to be an aerosol￾generating procedure requiring adequate 
levels of PPE, including N95 respirators, 
goggles, face shield, hairnet and long￾sleeved gowns. We believe that each centre 
has to develop its own strategies to ensure 
that deferred endoscopies are not missed 
once normal care resumes, especially for 
patients at risk of variceal bleeding.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 
COVID-19
Overall, patients with cancer have worse 
outcomes with COVID-19.31 32 This 
likely applies to patients with hepatocel￾lular carcinoma (HCC) as well since they 
are generally older, frailer and require 
multiple visits to healthcare facilities. All 
the societies uniformly recommend main￾taining continuity of care for patients with 
HCC by offering in-person visits when 
needed, performing follow-up scans in 
a timely manner and avoiding treatment 
interruptions.9–11 33 AASLD guidelines 
suggest it is reasonable to delay HCC 
surveillance by 2–3 months, since HCC 
is generally felt to be a slow-growing 
tumour. However, given the heterogenous 
growth patterns in HCC, we recommend 
physicians weigh the decision to post￾pone HCC surveillance on a case-by-case 
basis and to err on the side of caution.34
We suggest that multidisciplinary tumour 
boards continue to function remotely 
and provide treatment recommendations. 
ILCA made specific recommendations 
for management of the various stages 
of HCC.11 For patients with early-stage 
HCC whose curative resection or abla￾tion has been cancelled, they recom￾mend transarterial therapies as a bridge 
to definitive treatment. Patients with 
more advanced HCC who are receiving 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) should 
be able to continue therapy uninter￾rupted. EASL recommendations suggest 
that immunotherapy might have to be 
temporarily suspended to avoid expo￾sure to COVID-19 at the infusion centre. 
Enrolment in clinical trials has generally 
been halted during the pandemic, and 
these patients are recommended to be 
treated with TKIs, if eligible. We believe 
that patients with HCC are particularly 
prone to suffer collateral damage during 
COVID-19, and hence they should be 
followed up closely. We recommend using 
one of the published risk scores for HCC 
to prioritise patients for restarting surveil￾lance in the post-COVID-19 era.35 36
Strategic reopening of care for patients 
with chronic liver diseases
We acknowledge that the COVID-19 
pandemic is far from over. However, 
rebuilding is an essential part of disaster 
management. While hospitals hope to 
resume ‘near-normal’ operations soon, 
there are several factors to consider: the 
persistent need for social distancing, 
inadequate hospital capacities, possible 
impaired access to healthcare due to 
financial difficulties and healthcare avoid￾ance due to fears of contracting corona￾virus.37 Moreover, we expect a second 
surge of patients whose care has now been 
deferred, and we need to strategically plan 
ahead to manage this. A scoring system 
based on medical necessity, tailored to 
liver patients, would be ideal to prioritise 
patients who need to be seen earlier.38
Though less palatable, evening and 
weekend slots for clinic visits, as well as 
screening and surveillance imaging, may 
need to be initiated. Additionally, a multi￾pronged communication system needs to 
be set up to ensure all patients have access 
to care. Particularly vulnerable patient 
populations include those who relapsed 
into alcoholism, decompensated liver 
disease or those with HCC. Specifically, 
for patients with HCC, we have to expe￾ditiously reschedule the imaging scans 
that have been postponed, safely resume 
elective procedures like surgical resections 
and ablative therapies, and ramp up clin￾ical trial enrolment. Lastly, we believe this 
is the right time for all hospitals and clinics 
to be investing in organisational prepared￾ness and capacity planning to handle the 
second surge.
Conclusions
The response of the international liver 
community during the COVID-19 
pandemic has been swift and thoughtful. 
Several major international societies have 
undertaken extensive efforts to provide 
recommendations on how to manage 
patients with liver disease during COVID￾19. Our comparative review clearly high￾lights the fact that despite differences in 
healthcare resources and disease preva￾lence, the major concepts outlined in the 
various international recommendations 
are relatively similar but for minor differ￾ences that we highlight. Broad princi￾ples of infection control, mitigation, risk 
stratification and supportive management 
remain universal. While our knowledge 
of COVID-19 is still rapidly evolving, in 
this comprehensive overview, we provide 
a global perspective on the management 
of liver disease during COVID-19. We call 
on policymakers and governments to craft 
a comprehensive plan now, rather than 
later, in anticipation of the ‘second surge’ 
of patients with liver diseases.
