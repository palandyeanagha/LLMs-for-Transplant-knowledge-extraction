Abstract:
A 60-year-old man presented with postoperative recurrence of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with right
portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT). After failure of standard chemotherapy, a liver biopsy showed that his
microsatellite instability (MSI) status was high. Treatment with the immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) pem￾brolizumab was commenced, which resulted in a partial response and resolution of the PVTT. There were no
significant immune-related adverse events. According to recently published reports, the frequency of MSI￾high biliary tract cancer (BTC) is about 0-2.1%, which is extremely rare. However, ICIs may be effective in
patients with MSI-high BTC, such as the present patient.

Introduction
Based on the results of a phase III clinical trial [advanced
bilary tract cancer (ABC)-02 trial] (1) and a phase II clinical
trial (BT-22 trial) (2), gemcitabine plus cisplatin (CisGem)
has become the standard first-line chemotherapeutic regimen
for advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC) in Japan and else￾where. However, the median overall survival (OS) after ad￾ministration of CisGem for advanced BTC is 11.2-11.7
months, which requires improvement.
The phase II KEYNOTE-158 study revealed that, regard￾less of their primary site, microsatellite instability (MSI)-
high and mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) tumors have
promising responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors
(ICIs) (3). In December 2018, pembrolizumab, an anti￾programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) monoclonal anti￾body, was approved in Japan for MSI-high solid cancers that
were refractory to standard chemotherapy; this includes
BTC.
We herein report a patient with MSI-high intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) with portal vein tumor thrombus
(PVTT) in whom pembrolizumab was effective.
Case Report
A 60-year-old man with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related
cirrhosis developed ICC (Fig. 1A, B), for which hepatic S6
partial resection and cholecystectomy were performed
(Fig. 1C-G). After the surgery, he was treated twice for

There was nothing of note in his family history.
Four years after his surgery, a nodule that appeared in the
right posterior segment of the liver was biopsied and found
to be a recurrence of ICC (Fig. 2A, B). Retroperitoneal
lymph node metastasis was also found near the right renal
vein (Fig. 2D), and oral oxycodone was started to control
the right hypochondrial pain caused by it. CisGem was com￾menced as first-line chemotherapy, which achieved stable
disease (SD). Thrombocytopenia necessitated progressive re-

duction of his CisGem to a 60% dose. Finally, despite this
dose reduction, he developed grade 3 thrombocytopenia af￾ter three courses and CisGem therapy was discontinued
(Fig. 3).
He then commenced oral S-1 as second-line chemother￾apy. This initially maintained SD; however, he was found to
have progressive disease (PD) one year later. His perform￾ance status deteriorated, and the decision was made to con￾centrate on palliative care. He was given radiation therapy
(total 46 Gy/23 fractions) to the retroperitoneal lymph node
metastasis to control his cancer pain, which was alleviated
along with significant shrinkage of the metastatic lesion
(Fig. 2C-E). Fifteen months after the initial chemotherapy,
his intrahepatic lesions had grown, accompanied by right
PVTT (Vp3; portal invasion at the first branch; Fig. 4A, B).
His MSI status was determined by an examination of liver
biopsy specimens from the site of recurrence. Because the
MSI status was high, he was started on an ICI (intravenous
pembrolizumab 200 mg, every three weeks). This achieved a
partial response (PR) and disappearance of the Vp3 PVTT
(Fig. 4C, D). During the subsequent year, the PR was main￾tained. Nine months after the start of ICI, the level of carci￾noembryonic antigen (CEA) increased again; however,
whole-body computed tomography showed no apparent new
lesions, and PR was maintained. Ten months after the start
of ICI, the CEA level showed a downward trend (Fig. 3).
Thus far, he has shown no significant adverse events, such
as immune-related adverse events (irAEs).
Discussion
ICIs have revolutionized the treatment of patients with
various advanced-stage cancers. Several studies have shown
that MSI-high/dMMR is a positive predictor of the response
to ICIs (4). In May 2017, the Food and Drug Administration
granted accelerated approval to the anti-PD-1 monoclonal
antibody pembrolizumab for treatment of patients with unre￾sectable or metastatic MSI-high or dMMR solid tumors that
continued to progress after standard chemotherapy based on
the data from 233 patients with MSI-high or dMMR cancers
who had been enrolled in the phase II KEYNOTE-158
study. This was the first time that the Food and Drug Ad￾ministration had approved a cancer treatment based on that
tumor’s specific genetic features, regardless of its primary
site.
In December 2018, pembrolizumab was also approved in
Japan for the treatment of advanced or recurrent MSI-high
solid tumors that continue to progress after standard chemo-

therapy. This new indication marks a paradigm shift in the
strategies for treating cancers; however, MSI-high/dMMR
solid tumors are very rare (5). According to published re￾ports, they account for only 0-18.2% of BTCs (6-12) (Ta￾ble 1). In studies published in the last 3 years, the frequency
of MSI-high BTCs was only 0-2.1%. Silva et al. reported
that MSI-high tumors accounted for 5% of gallbladder can￾cer and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas; however, they ac￾count for 10% of ICC and papillary carcinomas (13). Inter￾estingly, the frequency of MSI-high BTCs may vary by tu￾mor location.
Since 2017, six cases of BTCs treated with pembrolizu￾mab have been reported (Table 2) (14-17). Among these
cases, the responses achieved with ICI treatment were dura￾ble. Thus, other patients with MSI-high BTC besides our
own have also reportedly achieved good therapeutic effects
with ICIs. Table 3 shows the results of clinical trials con￾cerning the treatment of BTCs with pembrolizu￾mab (3, 12, 18, 19). In the trials where patients were treated
with pembrolizumab, irrespective of their MSI status, the
objective response rate (ORR) was 5.8-17%, and the OS
was 6.4-9.1 months. By comparison, in the KEYNOTE-158
study (6), which enrolled only patients with MSI-high tu￾mors, the results of the treatment of 22 patients with ad￾vanced BTC with pembrolizumab were as follows: complete
response (CR), 2 patients; PR, 7 patients; ORR 40.9%, me￾dian progression-free survival (PFS) 4.2 months [95% confi￾dence interval (CI) 2.1 to not reached (NR)]; and median
OS 24.3 months (95% CI 6.5 to NR) (3). Thus, the out￾comes were significantly better than in trials that did not
take the MSI status into consideration. In the ABC-02 study,
the results of treating advanced BTC with CisGem were as
follows: ORR 26.1%, median PFS 8.0 months (95% CI, 6.6-
8.6) and median OS 11.7 months (95% CI 9.5-14.3) (1).
Therefore, the outcomes of treating patients with MSI-high
BTC with pembrolizumab are excellent compared with the
results of CisGem, which has been the standard chemother￾apy for patients with BTC. Because a long-term survival has
been reported in patients with various carcinomas that have
responded to ICIs (20), worsening of the performance status
because of the failure of second-line treatment with CisGem
should be avoided whenever possible. It would instead be
preferable to determine the MSI status as early as possible
after starting CisGem therapy. In the future, ICIs may be￾come the first-line chemotherapy for MSI-high ICC.
Our patient’s ICC was associated with right PVTT. PVTT
occurs more frequently in association with hepatocellular
carcinoma than with ICC; thus, there is little clinical infor￾mation concerning the latter. Lu et al. reported that patients
with ICC PVTT have a poorer post-hepatic resection prog￾nosis than those without PVTT (21). In general, ICC with
PVTT is characterized by an aggressive disease course, poor
hepatic function, high incidence of complications related to
portal hypertension and poor tolerance to treatment. How￾ever, our case shows that pembrolizumab may be an effec￾tive treatment for ICC with PVTT. The good response to
pembrolizumab may have been related to our patient under￾going radiotherapy (RT) for retroperitoneal lymph node me-

tastasis. A phenomenon whereby RT to one site is associated
with regression of metastatic cancer at distant, non-irradiated
sites has been described and called the abscopal effect (22).
Of interest, the enhancement of antitumor effects of ICIs
through the concomitant use of local RT has been reported
for various advanced cancers, including melanoma (22, 23).
When a tumor is irradiated, the cellular stress or injury
within the tumor, manifesting as necrotic and apoptotic tu￾mor cells, may lead to the release of neo-antigens, here re￾ferred to as tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). A substantial
increase in the number and diversity of TAAs can stimulate
a tumor-specific immune response. Thus, this is a possible
mechanism underlying the enhancement of the therapeutic
effect of ICIs by RT.
While there have been many reports of the simultaneous
initiation of RT and ICIs, a PubMed search did not yield
any reports of the effective treatment with an ICI after a
time lag of nearly six months following RT, as in our pa￾tient. However, Yaguchi et al. reported a case of postopera￾tive recurrence of lung adenocarcinoma (pleural seeding,
cancerous lymphangitis, brain metastases, and multiple bone
metastases) in which the patient received palliative RT (30
Gy) at the site of right hip joint bone metastases followed
by nivolumab 1 month later (24). In this patient, nivolumab
was effective and achieved a close to complete response.
Thus, this patient appeared to respond to an ICI in a similar
fashion to our own patient, which suggests a possible absco￾pal effect. The potential utility of a combination of RT and
an ICI for various cancers is currently being investigated in
a number of clinical trials (25). Further research is needed
to determine whether or not this combination can improve
the prognosis of patients with BTC.
The toxicity profile of ICIs differs substantially from that
of classic cytotoxic agents. Although our patient developed
no irAEs, the possibility of irAEs should always be kept in
mind during such treatment.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of pembrolizu￾mab being effective in a patient with ICC and PVTT. More
cases need to be accumulated to confirm the effectiveness of
pembrolizumab in advanced BTC with MSI-high status.
The patient gave his written informed consent for the publica￾tion of the details of his case.
The authors state that they have no Conflict of Interest (COI).
