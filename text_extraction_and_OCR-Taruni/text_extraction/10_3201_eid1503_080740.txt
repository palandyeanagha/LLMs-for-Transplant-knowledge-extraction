In the United States, the seroprevalence rate for hepa￾titis E virus (HEV) is ≈20%. This study examined HEV se￾roprevalence in persons with and without chronic liver dis￾ease. Our data indicate that HEV seropositivity is high in 
patients with chronic liver disease and that HEV seropreva￾lence increases signifi cantly with age. 
The hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an enterically transmit￾ted, hepatotropic, single-stranded RNA virus. It causes 
a self-limiting acute infection, but the infection does not 
develop into chronic disease in immunocompetent persons. 
Although symptoms are generally mild, they may be severe 
in certain cases, especially in pregnant women (1). HEV is 
endemic in regions where the water supply may be con￾taminated with animal waste, such as in Central Asia, the 
Middle East, and parts of South America and Africa. Large 
waterborne epidemics have occurred in refugee camps in 
Somalia (2) and Sudan (3), causing sickness and death. In 
regions where HEV is endemic, seroprevalence and illness 
rates for hepatitis E infection vary from 40%–90% (4,5). In 
the United States, seroprevalence studies detected antibod￾ies against HEV (anti-HEV) in >21% of blood donors (6). 
Despite this indication of its presence in the United States, 
HEV infection is rarely diagnosed in this country except in 
travelers to HEV-endemic areas (7). 
Recent reports have demonstrated that zoonotic 
(swine) reservoirs may exist in non–disease-endemic re￾gions (8) and that unrecognized HEV may be the source of 
cryptogenic hepatitis in certain cases (9). Data concerning 
immunocompromised patients are scarce; however, higher 
seroprevalence of HEV has been reported in HIV-positive 
persons than in the general population. Additionally, in pa￾tients with compromised immune systems, symptoms of 
HEV infection and viremia may be prolonged (10,11). We 
conducted a study to determine the seroprevalence of anti￾HEV in persons with and without chronic liver disease to 
uncover potential associations between clinical markers of 
liver disease and HEV seroprevalence and to identify risk 
factors associated with HEV positivity.
The Study
We performed an observational cross-sectional anal￾ysis of de-identifi ed serum samples and data from patients 
with chronic liver disease who were monitored at the Uni￾versity of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio. Data and samples 
were collected during 1995–2006. Healthy donor samples 
were obtained from controls (generally healthcare and 
laboratory personnel) who had no evidence of liver dis￾ease. Limited demographic, clinical, and laboratory data 
were collected from medical records and existing data￾bases for patients with chronic liver disease and for con￾trols. Tests for anti-HEV immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM 
were performed by ELISA (MP Biomedicals Asia Pacifi c 
Pte Ltd, Singapore; formerly Genelabs Diagnostic Pte 
Ltd) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Assay 
validity was evaluated according to the manufacturer’s 
specifi cations. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory val￾ues were reported as mean ± SD for normally distributed 
variables and as median (range) for nonnormal continu￾ous variables. Between-group comparisons were assessed 
by analysis of variance with the Sidak adjustment for mul￾tiple comparisons, the Kruskal-Wallis test, the χ2
 test, or 
Fisher exact test, as appropriate to the data distribution. 
Logistic regression was used to determine predictors of 
IgG positivity. A 2-tailed p value <0.01 was considered 
signifi cant in all cases.
A total of 167 persons with a mean age of 39.6 years 
(+10.9 years) were evaluated. Of these, 129 had chronic 
hepatitis (46 [35.7%] of whom were co-infected with HIV), 
and 38 were healthy controls. Demographic and labora￾tory characteristics are displayed in Table 1. The most

common causes of chronic liver disease were hepatitis C 
virus (HCV) infection, present in 59 (45.7%) of the 129 
persons, and HCV/HIV co-infection, present in another 39 
(30.2%). Other causes of liver disease included hepatitis 
B virus (HBV) infection (7.8%), HBV/HIV co-infection 
(6.2%), autoimmune hepatitis (3.1%), and idiopathic hepa￾titis (6.9%). Of those with liver disease, 89.9% had viral 
infections and 30.2% had alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
levels >2× the upper limit of the reference range. Eighty￾four patients had risk factors assessed, and 68 of those had 
a known risk factor for viral hepatitis. These risk factors in￾cluded being an injection drug user or man who has sex with 
men, using cocaine nasally, having had a blood transfusion, 
and having hemophilia. Forty-nine (29.3%) of the 167 per￾sons evaluated tested positive for HEV IgG antibody, and 
most of these persons (45/49, 91.8%) had chronic liver dis￾ease. None were positive for anti-HEV IgM, a marker for 
acute HEV infection. Optical densities (ODs) for anti-HEV 
IgG differed signifi cantly (p<0.001); the group with liver 
disease had greater values than the controls (mean 0.63 ± 
0.96 and 0.13 ± 0.38, respectively; median 0.12 and 0.03, 
respectively), as shown in Figure 1. No relationship was 
shown between anti-HEV IgG ODs and the cause of liver 
disease. Because the odds of HEV seropositivity increase 
with age, correlation between age and ODs was examined; 
ODs increased signifi cantly with age (p<0.001, Spearman 
rank correlation r = 0.305) (Figure 2).
To determine characteristics associated with testing 
positive for HEV, univariable logistic regression was con￾ducted. Predictors of signifi cance included age (p = 0.002), 
male gender (p = 0.009), liver disease (p = 0.001), and HIV 
co-infection (p = 0.04). A multivariable regression model 
was then developed with age and liver disease and age by 
liver disease interaction as predictors. The interaction was 
not signifi cant (p = 0.97) and, therefore, was removed from 
the model. The fi nal model showed that the chance of be￾ing HEV positive increases as age increases (adjusted odds 
ratio [AOR] 1.05, p = 0.002). Also, probability of HEV 
positivity is signifi cantly greater if other liver disease is 
present (AOR 7.78, p<0.001) (Table 2). Male gender was 
signifi cantly associated with HEV positivity (AOR 2.07, 
p = 0.009), but no associations were found between HEV 
positivity and race/ethnicity, viral versus nonviral liver dis￾ease, ALT level, or HIV seropositivity.
Conclusions
HEV in the United States and other industrialized 
nations is not thought to present a substantial risk of ill￾ness and death; however, recent data suggest that in these 
regions, HEV may be a cause of cryptogenic hepatitis. In 
Japan, HEV RNA has been detected in blood donors with 
elevated liver enzymes (12). A recent report from France 
found that acute HEV in persons who had not traveled to 
HEV-endemic regions may cause fulminant hepatitis, es￾pecially in those with active alcohol use and other chronic 
liver disease (13). Despite these associations and evidence 
of decompensation in patients with cirrhosis from preexist￾ing liver disease in developing countries (14,15), whether 
HEV causes fulminant hepatitis among those with chronic 
liver disease who live in the United States is unknown. 
Our study has limitations that should be noted. First, 
the intent of this analysis was to determine whether an as￾sociation between HEV and chronic liver disease was de￾tectable. We therefore used an observational study design.

HEV Antibodies in Patients with Liver Disease 
The results of the study should be carefully interpreted to 
avoid assumptions of a cause-effect relationship, as this 
study was a cross-sectional survey. Second, 2 discrete 
populations were included. Differences in sample collec￾tion dates, geographic location, and other variables could 
affect results, although no evidence of any confounding 
effect was detected. Third, as is the case in many retro￾spective analyses, we were unable to collect all risk factors 
and characteristics of persons in the study. Underreport￾ing of injection drug users, for example, would undermine 
power for detection of an association between drug use and 
HEV seropositivity. However, collecting data on behav￾ior risk factors for viral hepatitis poses a challenge even 
in prospective studies, and our results are consistent with 
expectations.
Whether HEV superinfection mediates other liver dis￾ease in persons living in the United States can be deter￾mined only by prospective cohort studies. Such follow-up 
is warranted to determine the role of HEV superinfection as 
a participating factor in liver diseases.
