No consensus on the indications for surgical resection of colorectal liver metastases exists. This systematic review has been
undertaken to assess the published evidence for its efficacy and safety and to identify prognostic factors. Studies were identified by
computerised and hand searches of the literature, scanning references and contacting investigators. The outcome measures were
overall survival, disease-free survival, postoperative morbidity and mortality, quality of life and cost effectiveness, and a qualitative
summary of the trends across all studies was produced. Only 30 of 529 independent studies met all the eligibility criteria for the
review, and data on 30-day mortality and morbidity only were included from a further nine studies. The best available evidence came
from prospective case series, but only two studies reported outcomes for all patients undergoing surgery. The remainder reported
outcomes for selected groups of patients: those undergoing hepatic resection or those undergoing curative resection. Postoperative
mortality rates were generally low (median 2.8%). The majority of studies described only serious postoperative morbidity, the most
common being bile leak and associated perihepatic abscess. Approximately 30% of patients remained alive 5 years after resection and
around two-thirds of these are disease free. The quality of the majority of published papers was poor and ascertaining the benefits of
surgical resection of colorectal hepatic metastases is difficult in the absence of randomised trials. However, it is clear that there is
group of patients with liver metastases who may become long-term disease- free survivors following hepatic resection. Such survival is
rare in apparently comparable patients who do not have surgical treatment. Further work is needed to more accurately define this
group of patients and to determine whether the addition of adjuvant treatments results in improved survival.

Colorectal cancer is the third most common cause of cancer death
in the UK (Cancer Research UK Information Resource Centre,
2003). Surgery is the treatment of choice for patients with localised
disease but over half of all patients will develop metastases. The
liver is often the first site of metastatic disease and may be the only
site of spread in as many as 30 –40% of patients with advanced
disease (Weiss et al, 1986; Hugh et al, 1997a).
It has been postulated that because haematogenous spread
usually occurs in a stepwise fashion, initially to the liver, with
subsequent intrahepatic spread via the portal vein and further
spread to the systemic circulation, surgical resection of isolated
hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer may be curative.
The natural history of metastatic colorectal cancer is variable,
with a median survival without treatment of only 8 months
(Seymour et al, 1997; Simmonds, 2000). Patients with isolated
hepatic metastases have a better prognosis than those with more
extensive metastatic disease (Goslin et al, 1982; Lahr et al, 1983;
Stangl et al, 1994; Rougier et al, 1995) suggesting biological
differences in the two settings (Goslin et al, 1982; Lahr et al, 1983;
Stangl et al, 1994; Rougier et al, 1995). However, few patients with
limited liver-only metastases survive for 5 years (Goslin et al, 1982;
Stangl et al, 1994).
A variety of therapeutic approaches have been used in the
treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer including surgery,
chemotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, cryotherapy or some
combination of these (Primrose, 2002). Around 20 –30% of
patients with liver-only metastases are potentially resectable
(Nordlinger et al, 1994; Stangl et al, 1994; Jeffery et al, 2002).
The selection criteria for surgery are usually controlled primary
tumour, no extra hepatic metastases and that resection is
technically feasible with tumour-free margins (Hugh et al,
1997b). A small proportion of patients with completely resectable
extrahepatic disease may become long-term survivors (Scheele
et al, 1995). Chemotherapy used alone is palliative but may
prolong the survival of patients with unresectable disease (de
Gramont et al, 2000; Douillard et al, 2000; Saltz et al, 2000;
Simmonds, 2000). Used in combination with surgery it may
prolong the time to recurrence after resection of hepatic

metastases (Kemeny et al, 2002) or downsize to resectability
patients previously judged inoperable (Giacchetti et al, 1999). The
role of other treatments is poorly defined (Armstrong et al, 1994;
Donovan, 1995; Adam et al, 1997; de Baere et al, 1999; Primrose,
2002).
Although there are a large number of published studies
reporting the results of surgical resection of hepatic metastases
from colorectal cancer, the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of
such surgery remains unclear. This systematic review has been
undertaken to assess the published evidence for the efficacy and
safety of this intervention and, by examining potential prognostic
factors, identify patients who may either benefit from surgery or in
whom such intervention is inappropriate.
METHODS
Criteria for selecting studies
As randomised trials comparing surgical resection vs no surgery
have never been conducted, we have attempted to identify all
relevant prospective and retrospective series reporting the out￾comes of surgical resection with curative intent of colorectal
hepatic metastases. Patients undergoing repeat hepatic resection
were also included. In order to ensure that the surgical series
reviewed reflected the outcomes for patients treated with modern
surgical, anaesthetic and supportive care techniques, we have
restricted our qualitative analysis to surgical series published after
1980 reporting the outcomes of at least 100 patients. Studies were
required to follow patients for at least 30 days for inclusion of data
on postoperative morbidity and mortality, and for a median of at
least 24 months for inclusion of survival data. No language
restriction was applied on searching. All eligible European
language studies were translated, but retrospective non-European
articles were not.
The outcome measures were overall survival (1 year/3 year/5
year), disease-free survival (1 year/3 year/5 year), operative and
postoperative morbidity, operative and postoperative mortality,
quality of life and cost effectiveness.
Search strategy
We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Con￾trolled Trials Register, Medline, Embase, Cancerlit, Science
Citation Index, Edina Biosis, CINAHL and NHS Economic
Evaluation Database. Both medical subject heading and free text
searching were used to improve the sensitivity of the search. The
search strategy was piloted and modified to improve the hit rate,
and the sensitivity of the search strategy was tested by hand
searching three journals in which a high proportion of identified
studies had been published (Cancer, British Journal of Surgery, and
Diseases of the Colon and Rectum, 1998 –1999). All relevant studies
had been identified, confirming that the search was comprehen￾sive. Searching took place between May 2000 and October 2000.
The full search strategy is available from the authors on request.
The following registers were searched for details of ongoing and
unpublished studies: National Research Register, Current Con￾trolled Trials, MRC Funded Research database, UKCCCR trials
register, Centre Watch Clinical Trials listing, Physician Data Query
(USA), National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials (USA), National
Health and Medical Research Council (Australia), Trial Amnesty
on the Cochrane library, System for Information on Grey
Literature in Europe (SIGLE). Investigators of eligible prospective
studies and large surgical centres were contacted to find further
published, unpublished or ongoing studies, and the reference lists
of review articles on this subject and all eligible studies were
examined. In order to identify studies that had not been indexed in
the above sources, the Proceedings of the American Society of
Clinical Oncology (1982 –2000) were hand searched.
Review procedures and analysis
All relevant studies were assessed according to the above inclusion
criteria using a standard checklist performed independently by two
reviewers (one clinical and one non-clinical) and agreement on
eligibility was reached. Investigators were contacted for further
information where eligibility could not be determined from the
published study. Data were extracted from published papers by
one reviewer using a standard data extraction sheet and then
verified independently by a second reviewer. Data extracted
included demographic characteristics of patients, preoperative
comorbidities, details of the primary tumour, details of hepatic
and extrahepatic metastases, type of resection, nonsurgical therapy
and outcomes. When a study had generated multiple publications,
the most recent was used to extract data on relevant outcome
variables. Earlier publications were used to provide information on
baseline characteristics or methodology where necessary. Validity
was assessed independently by two reviewers using a standard
critical appraisal checklist. For the purposes of this review, items
relevant to the assessment of uncontrolled surgical case series were
combined from two checklists (Cowley, 1995; Downs and Black,
1998). The checklist was piloted by two reviewers and assessed
quality of reporting and internal and external validity. An index of
inter-rater agreement was calculated using the Kappa statistic. As
all of the eligible published studies were either prospective or
retrospective case series, a qualitative summary was produced to
identify and describe trends across all studies.
RESULTS
Description of studies identified
Of 529 studies identified by our initial search strategy, 470 were
not included in the review, often for more than one reason: 409
(77%) reported less than 100 patients, the median follow-up was
less than 24 months in 45 (9%) and unclear in 345 (65%) studies.
Other reasons for exclusion were combined data from colorectal
and non-colorectal liver metastases (38/529) and lack of mortality
and survival data (21/529). The eligibility of 19 publications was
unclear, but as these were updated elsewhere the older reports
were excluded, and 15 studies were not included because their
eligibility remained unclear despite seeking further details from
the authors of the original report. A list of excluded studies with
reasons for exclusion is available on request from the authors.
Forty-nine published and unpublished studies met all the
inclusion criteria, including multiple publications presenting
updated information or data on different aspects of the same
patient population, providing 30 independent eligible studies.
Eighteen of these were single publications (Savage and Malt, 1992;
Sugihara et al, 1993; Donato et al, 1994; Doci et al, 1995;
Fernandez-Trigo et al, 1995; Fuhrman et al, 1995; Beckurts et al,
1997; Rees et al, 1997; Cady et al, 1998; Ohlsson et al, 1998;
Riesener et al, 1998; Bradley et al, 1999; Harmon et al, 1999; Harms
et al, 1999; Kemeny et al, 1999a; Bolton and Fuhrman, 2000; Okano
et al, 2000; Moroz et al, 2002) and in a further 12 cases the data was
obtained from multiple publications (Hughes et al, 1988, 1989;
Hohenberger et al, 1990, 1994; Scheele et al, 1990, 1991, 1995, 1996;
Steele Jr et al, 1991, 1995; Rosen et al, 1992; Gayowski et al, 1994;
Stangl et al, 1994; Fong et al, 1995, 1997, 1999; Leslie et al, 1995;
Jamison et al, 1996, 1997; Jenkins et al, 1997; Bakalakos et al,
1998a, b; Iwatsuki et al, 1999; Minagawa et al, 1999; Ambiru et al,
1999a; Kemeny et al, 1999b, c; Brand et al, 2000; DeMatteo et al,
2000; Minagawa et al, 2000). In addition, data on 30-day mortality
and morbidity were included from a further nine studies (one with
two publications) in which survival data was excluded owing to
insufficient or unclear follow up (Minton and Abou-Issa, 1990;
Fegiz et al, 1991; Nordlinger et al, 1992; van Ooijen et al, 1992;

et al, 1997; Figueras et al, 2001). Details of all studies are tabulated
in Appendix A.
Just two studies included all patients presenting with colorectal
liver metastases (Scheele et al, 1990, 1991, 1995, 1996; Stangl et al,
1994; Harms et al, 1999) and only three studies presented data on
all patients undergoing surgery (radical, nonradical and lapar￾otomy) (Steele Jr et al, 1991, 1995; Fuhrman et al, 1995; Bakalakos
et al, 1998a). The majority (27) of studies presented data on
resected patients, but while some studies distinguished between R0
resections (no residual disease, histologically clear margins), R1
(histologically involved margins) and R2 resections (macroscopic
residual disease), in many this was unclear. Six studies included
only a select group of patients undergoing radical resection, and
one study included patients undergoing repeat resection only.
Eleven studies were conducted prospectively, three of which
were randomised controlled trials comparing surgery alone with
surgery plus chemotherapy (Lorenz et al, 1998; Kemeny et al,
1999a) or comparing two adjuvant chemotherapy regimes
(Kemeny et al, 1999c). Twenty-five studies were retrospective
and the design of three studies was unclear. Twenty-six studies
were conducted in single centres, 11 were multicentre studies and
two were undertaken by two centres.
No data was found on comorbidity, quality of life, or cost
effectiveness of liver resection.
Methodological quality of included studies
There was consistency in validity appraisal between the two
reviewers, as indicated by a Kappa statistic of 0.79. The 16-point
validity scale was completed for all studies, including one study
that was published in abstract form only (Kemeny et al, 1999a)
(Appendix B). Total scores ranged from 2 to 14 (mean 8.7, median
9).
The quality of reporting was poor in many studies. Eligibility
criteria for surgery or inclusion criteria in the study were not
reported by 12 (31%) studies. The distribution of principal
confounders, such as synchronous or metachronous metastases
and curative intent of surgery were not reported by almost a third
of studies. Basic demographic information such as mean age and
sex distribution was also often missing. Patients were thought to be
representative in only a minority of studies (mostly highly
selected), and similarly the treatment centres were considered to
be unrepresentative (highly specialised).
The primary end points of mortality and survival were not
clearly defined in 33 and 74% of studies, respectively; therefore, the
comparability of results between studies is unclear. Postoperative
mortality was excluded from survival analysis in 21% studies, and
patients lost to follow-up were not reported or not included in the
appropriate analysis by over half of the studies. Median length of
follow-up was not reported by 31% of studies. The outcome of
patients receiving surgery alone was reported by just 12 (31%)
studies. In 10 (26%) studies patients receiving additional therapies
such as adjuvant chemotherapy were not analysed separately.
Further, the use of additional therapies was not stated in 17 (44%)
studies.
Postoperative mortality
Death within 30 days of hepatic resection was reported by 24
studies, ranging from 0 to 6.6% of patients (median 2.8%). A
further nine studies reported perioperative mortality within an
undefined time period (1.3 –4.6%, median 3.6%), and two studies
reported 60-day mortality (3.4 –5.5%). Mortality was not reported
by four studies. Cause of death was reported by 15 studies for a
total of 103 patients (Table 1), including two studies that reported
deaths from surgical complications occurring within 90 days
(Iwatsuki et al, 1999) and 128 days (Scheele et al, 1996).
Postoperative morbidity
Perioperative complications, including indicators of morbidity
such as length of hospital stay, were reported by 29 studies.
However, some studies reported fatal complications only (van
Ooijen et al, 1992; Scheele et al, 1996; Lorenz et al, 1998; Bolton
and Fuhrman, 2000; Moroz et al, 2002), length of hospital stay only
(Hohenberger et al, 1994; Fuhrman et al, 1995), blood transfusions
only (Jamison et al, 1997) or simply reported the number of
patients with nonspecified complications (van Ooijen et al, 1992;
Fernandez-Trigo et al, 1995; Scheele et al, 1996; Jenkins et al, 1997;
Taylor et al, 1997; Bakalakos et al, 1998a; Fong et al, 1999; Figueras
et al, 2001).
The number of studies reporting each complication and
the number of patients with the complication is presented in
Table 2.
Overall survival
Two studies reported overall survival at 5 years for all patients
undergoing surgery (resection and laparotomy only), median 23%
(15 –31%) (Table 3). Studies in which it was unclear whether
resections were R0 or R1/2, or only presented data for both types
of resection combined, had a median 5-year survival of 32% (9 –
63%). Sixteen studies presented 5-year survival for patients
undergoing R0 resection, either for the whole study population
or for subgroups of patients. Median 5-year survival for these
studies was 30% (range 15 –67%). Eleven studies reporting 5-year
survival for nonradical resections had a median 5-year survival of
7.2% (range 0 –30%), and six studies reporting patients who did
not undergo resection had a median 5-year survival of 0% (range
0 –6%). Survival according to study design is also presented in
Table 3. Patients who underwent resection without any additional
therapy had a median 5-year survival of 30% (range 20 –33.6%),
whereas patients who received additional therapy had a median 5-
year survival of 35.5% (range 9 –63%). Studies in which use of
additional therapy was not stated reported 5-year survival between
14 and 58% (median 32.5%). Overall 5-year survival was not
reported by three studies (Donato et al, 1994; Hohenberger et al,
1994; Cady et al, 1998), and one study reporting survival from

repeat hepatic resections only was not included in this analysis
(Fernandez-Trigo et al, 1995).
Disease-free survival
Disease-free survival was reported by fewer studies. Median
disease-free survival was 11.6 (Hohenberger et al, 1994) and 17
(Doci et al, 1995) months (median 14.3 months) for radically
resected patients and between 10.8 and 37.4 months (median 17.2
months) for patients with unspecified resections (Jenkins et al,
1997; Ohlsson et al, 1998; Kemeny et al, 1999c; Minagawa et al,
2000).
Five-year disease-free survival was reported between 9 and 35%
(median 18%) (Doci et al, 1995; Scheele et al, 1996; Ambiru
et al, 1999b) and 4 –47% (median 21%) (Hughes et al, 1989;
Jenkins et al, 1997; Ohlsson et al, 1998; Bradley et al, 1999;
Iwatsuki et al, 1999; Minagawa et al, 2000; Okano et al, 2000) by
studies with radically resected patients and unspecified resections,
respectively.
Sites of recurrence
Sites of recurrence following hepatic resection were reported by 13
studies (Table 4). They were classified as liver, extrahepatic or liver
plus extrahepatic. Twenty-two percent of all patients experienced
recurrence in the liver only, although this is likely to be
underestimated as two studies did not specify the proportion of
liver-only recurrences. Liver plus extrahepatic recurrences and
extrahepatic-only recurrences were experienced by 16 and 24% of
patients, respectively. In addition, one study reported recurrences
in 235 (62.5%) radically resected patients, although sites of
recurrence were not specified.
Prognostic factors
Many studies reported 1-year, 3-year, 5-year and median overall
survival and disease-free survival for various potential prognostic
factors relating to the characteristics of the primary tumour and/or
liver metastases. In general, comparison between studies is limited

owing to differences in categorisation of the prognostic factors. A
definition of ‘synchronous’ is not given in most cases, but could
mean hepatic resection within 1 month (Hughes et al, 1989), 3
months (Jamison et al, 1997; Rees et al, 1997) or 6 months (Donato
et al, 1994) of primary surgery. Time interval between resection of
the primary tumour and metastases has been classified into five
different categories. Categories for number and size of liver
metastases are also extremely varied, and reporting of the type of
liver resection is inconsistent. Results from multivariate analysis,
which identified prognostic factors independently associated with
overall survival, are shown in Table 5. As the factors included in
the model differed for each study these cannot be directly
compared.
Repeat resections
In studies that reported this outcome, between 3.6 and 17%
(median 9%) of patients underwent repeat hepatic resection
(Scheele et al, 1996; Rees et al, 1997; Ohlsson et al, 1998; Bakalakos
et al, 1998a; Bradley et al, 1999; Iwatsuki et al, 1999; Ambiru et al,
1999b; Kemeny et al, 1999c; Minagawa et al, 2000). Three hepatic
resections were performed on 0.9 –4% (median 3.8%) of patients
(Ohlsson et al, 1998; Bakalakos et al, 1998a; Minagawa et al, 2000),
and just 0.4% underwent four resections (Minagawa et al, 2000).
The Repeat Hepatic Registry reported a series of 170 patients
undergoing repeat resection, of which 4.7% underwent a third
resection (Fernandez-Trigo et al, 1995). Median and 5-year overall
survival from the date of second liver resection for the 170 patients
was 34 months and 32%, respectively.
DISCUSSION
Although the prognosis of metastatic colorectal cancer is poor with
few patients surviving for 5 years or more (Stangl et al, 1994) long￾term survival has been reported following surgical resection of
isolated hepatic metastases (Fong and Salo, 1999; Geoghegan and
Scheele, 1999). The nature of the published studies of surgical
resection for colorectal liver metastases did not allow for a
quantitative analysis to be performed and we have thus undertaken
a qualitative systematic review to summarize the available evidence
for the effectiveness of this intervention.
Surgical resection of hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer
can be undertaken safely in the majority of patients. The median
postoperative (30 day) mortality reported by 24 studies was only
2.8% (0 –6.6%). There was patchy reporting of the causes of
postoperative death, with the most frequent causes being hepatic
failure, postoperative haemorrhage, and sepsis. It is likely that
current surgical and anaesthetic practice is associated with
perioperative mortalities nearer to 1% as demonstrated in a recent
multicentre trial (Nordlinger et al, 2005). Operative morbidity was
more difficult to quantify as many studies reported only fatal

It was therefore difficult to determine the proportion of patients

was 3 days. These limited results suggest that most patients require
only a short period of intensive care following hepatic resection for
colorectal metastases. The median or mean length of hospital stay
reported by 17 studies ranged from 7 –21 days indicating that
while most patients made a rapid recovery following surgery, some
experienced a more prolonged hospital stay possibly as a result of
complications from their surgery. None of the studies included in
this review presented information on recovery of patients’
functional status or quality of life following discharge from
hospital.
Two studies presented outcome data for all patients with
isolated colorectal hepatic metastases who underwent surgery,
resection and laparotomy only, with 15 and 31% of patients
surviving 5 years, respectively (Fuhrman et al, 1995; Harms et al,
1999). Studies including only patients who underwent resection
reported a survival of around 30% at 5 years for patients
undergoing potentially ‘curative’ resection of isolated hepatic
metastases and the majority are disease free at this time. The
survival of patients undergoing R0 resections were substantially
better (32% at 5 years) than for patients undergoing R1 resections
(7.2% at 5 years) and those who did not undergo resection (0% at 5
years).
Patients undergoing surgery may have a better prognosis than
other patients with metastatic colorectal cancer as their disease is
both confined to the liver and circumscribed within it. The patients
are also more likely to be of good performance status and
have little or no comorbidity. Identifying a comparable control
group in the absence of randomised trials is difficult. Goldberg
et al (1998) identified 548 patients with recurrent colorectal cancer
in a longitudinal study, of whom 222 (41%) were thought to be
suitable for ‘curative intent’ surgery. Potentially curative surgery
was performed in 109 (20%) and of these 28 (5%) were performed
for isolated liver metastases. The estimated recurrence-free
survival of patients following liver resection was 32% at 5 years,
similar to survival after lung resection and complete resection of
local recurrence. The 5-year survival after curative surgery at
other sites and multiple sites appeared worse (16 and 0%,
respectively). Although not stated, the survival of the patients
not treated surgically or who had palliative surgery was by
implication poor, but two out of 19 patients with circumscribed
disease liver or lung disease treated nonsurgically were alive at
final follow-up. A small number of retrospective studies have
attempted to determine the natural history of patients with isolated
liver metastases. In a review of 484 untreated patients with liver
metastases from colorectal cancer, those with the best prognosis
(p25% liver involvement, primary tumour grade 1/2, no extra
hepatic tumour and no mesenteric nodal involvement), had a
median survival of 21.3 months, compared with 30 months in
patients undergoing hepatic resection in the same institution
(Stangl et al, 1994). In a group of 125 patients with liver-only
metastases, most of whom had had no therapy, the median survival
was 12.5 months. All patients died within 5 years. Survival
correlated with the extent of liver disease. The presence of three or
fewer liver metastases was associated with a median survival
of 24 months (Goslin et al, 1982). Lahr et al (1983) studied 175
untreated patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer.
The median survival of these patients was 6.1 months and the
longest survivor lived for 67 months. Patients with 1 –4 liver
metastases lived longer than those with five or more metastases
(median survival 11.8 vs 4 months) (Lahr et al, 1983). A study
of 113 patients with hepatic metastases from colon cancer,
reported a mean survival of 3 months in patients with widespread
liver disease (Wood et al, 1976). Patients with metastases localised
to a segment or lobe had a mean survival of 17 months, compared
with 25 months for patients with a solitary liver metastases.
The overall 1-year survival rates were 6, 27, and 60%, respectively.
Another study attempted to distinguish potentially resectable
from unresectable disease (Wagner et al, 1984). Three groups
of untreated patients were studied. Patients with solitary (n ¼ 39),
multiple unilateral (n ¼ 31) and widespread (n ¼ 182) had
3-year survivals of 21, 6 and 4%, respectively. However by 5 years
virtually all were dead (3, 0 and 2% survival, respectively).
Some small studies have examined the outcome of patients with
unresected synchronous hepatic metastases (Bengtsson et al,
1981; Boey et al, 1981; Finan et al, 1985; Gorog et al, 1997). The
median survival of patients in these series ranged from 4.5 to 10.3
months. These studies suggest that there is a small select group of
patients with isolated liver metastases from colorectal cancer who
may live a long time without surgical intervention. However, their
prognosis remains poor because of the inexorable hepatic
progression and extrahepatic spread.
Disease recurrence is common after resection of colorectal
hepatic metastases indicating that in the majority of cases the
extent of the metastatic disease is underestimated by pre and
intraoperative staging investigations. Around one-third of patients
experienced disease recurrence in the liver alone and may be
candidates for repeat resection. The remainder experienced
recurrence concurrently in the liver and extrahepatic sites or in
extrahepatic sites only. It may be that biological features in the
tumour itself may be important as optimal imaging and this
requires further study.
Identification of prognostic factors that predict the outcome
following surgical resection of colorectal hepatic metastases would
assist in the identification of those patients most likely to benefit
from this intervention, or more importantly assist in the
identification of patients who were unlikely to benefit. Comparison
of the different studies included in this review was hampered by
differing definitions of the prognostic factors considered for
univariate or multivariate analyses. However, some potential
prognostic factors were found to be significant in more than half
of the studies. We are currently attempting to evaluate these
potential prognostic factors using a large prospectively collected
data set contributed by multiple centres. This will be published in
due course.
This review was performed deliberately on series published
up to the millennium as in recent years major changes have
occurred in the management of colorectal liver metastases.
These factors will almost certainly impact increasingly on the
reported outcomes after 2000 (Poston et al, 2005). Firstly modern
chemotherapy using cytotoxic agents alone offers extension of
median survival to 2 years in patients with nonresectable disease
(Cals et al, 2004; Goldberg et al, 2004; Grothey et al, 2004;
Tournigand et al, 2004). When monoclonal biological agents are
added to cytotoxic chemotherapy, the prospect of median survival
now extends beyond 2 years, and 20% of patients will still be alive
4 years after detection of unresectable liver disease (Cunningham
et al, 2004; Hurwitz et al, 2004; Saltz et al, 2004). It is therefore
inevitable that the combination of surgical resection and
chemotherapy, which is becoming commonplace, will impact on
the survival in the surgical series. The EORTC EPOC trial which is
the first to randomise liver resection patients to receive additional,
modern, chemotherapy is due for reporting in 2007 (Nordlinger
et al, 2005). Secondly, novel surgical strategies such as preopera￾tive portal vein embolisation to increase residual acceptably safe
volume, or two-stage hepatectomy to allow compensatory hepatic
hyperplasia before completion of R0 resection (Abdalla et al, 2002;
Pawlik et al, 2005; Poston et al, 2005), have also widened the
number of resectable patients including those with extensive liver￾only disease. These changes in the definition of resectability means
that 420% of patients with liver metastases can now be considered
for surgery with curative intent at the outset. It is unclear what the
long-term outcome of these strategies will be but the results appear
encouraging (Abdalla et al, 2002; Pawlik et al, 2005; Poston et al,
2005). This present review should both set the standard for the
reporting of subsequent surgical series and provide baseline results
to which they may be compared.

In summary there is a substantial body of evidence from
prospective and retrospective case series summarised in this
review demonstrating that resection of colorectal hepatic metas￾tases can be performed safely with a low mortality rate and around
one-third of patients will survive for 5 years or more. These
outcomes in highly selected patients exceed those normally
associated with metastatic colorectal cancer. Randomised trials
comparing surgical resection with nonsurgical treatment are not
now possible. Further information must come from well-docu￾mented prospective studies examining consecutive series of
patients with colorectal cancer and randomised trials comparing
liver resection alone with liver resection plus additional che￾motherapy.
