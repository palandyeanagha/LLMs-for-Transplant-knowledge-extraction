Recognition of the two types of lung disease is important because
their predictors and treatment differ
Pulmonary disease is now the leading cause of death in patients
with scleroderma. Of the 2000 patients in the Pittsburgh
scleroderma databank, 211 patients have died of lung disease over
the past 20 years. One hundred and thirteen died from isolated
pulmonary hypertension and 98 died of pulmonary interstitial
fibrosis. These account for 21.5% of the 981 deaths and 44% of the
scleroderma related deaths. Recently, progress has been made in the
treatment of specific lung problems in scleroderma so it is


imperative that we have a better understanding of the predictors of
these complications. Most important is the acknowledgement and
recognition that there are two types of lung disease in scleroderma
which are very different in their pathogenesis, clinical associations,
predictive factors, and treatment. The investigators of “Predictors of
end stage lung disease in a cohort of patients with scleroderma” in
this issue of the Annals admit that a limitation of their study was
that they were unable to separate their patients into the two types
of lung disease.1 By combining these two types of lung disease they
were unable to identify factors that would have likely been
predictors of one of the forms of lung disease. It is extremely
important to look carefully at the two types of lung disease
individually and not lump them all together as end stage lung
disease.
PULMONARY INTERSTITIAL FIBROSIS
Pulmonary interstitial fibrosis is felt to result from an alveolitis,
which leads to interstitial fibrosis.2 In some patients there may be a
significant vascular component, as there is in other manifestations
of the disease. However, the interactions of these two components
is incompletely understood and thus, we will focus primarily on the
inflammation and fibrosis component. In interstitial …
