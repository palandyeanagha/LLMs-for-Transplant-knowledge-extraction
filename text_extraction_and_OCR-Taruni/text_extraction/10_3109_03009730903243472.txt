Abstract
Alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) is an important serine protease inhibitor in humans. Hereditary alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency
(AATD) affects lungs and liver. Liver disease caused by AATD in paediatric patients has been previously well documented.
However, the association of liver disease with alpha-1-antitrypsin gene polymorphisms in adults is less clear. Therefore, we
aimed to study AAT polymorphisms in adults with liver disease. We performed a case-control study. AAT polymorphisms
were investigated by isoelectric focusing in 61 patients with liver cirrhosis and 9 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The
control group consisted of 218 healthy blood donors. A significant deviation of observed and expected frequency of AAT
phenotypes from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (chi-square = 34.77, df 11, P = 0.000) in the patient group was caused by a
higher than expected frequency of Pi ZZ homozygotes (f = 0.0143 and f = 0.0005, respectively, P = 0.000). In addition, Pi M
homozygotes were more frequent in patients than in controls (63% and 46%, respectively, P = 0.025). Our study results
show that Pi ZZ homozygosity in adults could be associated with severe liver disease. Presence of Pi M homozygosity could
be associated with liver disease via some mechanism different from Z allele-induced liver damage through accumulation of
AAT polymers.

Introduction
Alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) is a glycoprotein also
referred to as SERPINA1 (SERine Proteinase Inhibitors,
clade A, member 1), since it is a member of serine
protease inhibitor (serpin) family. The AAT molecule
is produced mainly in the liver and, in smaller quan￾tities, in macrophages and in the bronchial epithe￾lium. Through the circulation, AAT reaches the
lungs, where it will perform its anti-elastolytic func￾tion. AAT is also an acute phase protein. AAT is
encoded in the SERPINA1 gene, and more than
100 alleles have been identified to date. Approximately
30 of these alleles may have clinical implications.
Based on serum levels of AAT and molecular func￾tion, the Pi (Protese inhibitor) variants are classified
into four groups: normal (M alleles), deficient (serum
AAT less than one-sixth of normal values, Z alleles),
dysfunctional (normal serum AAT but with reduced
function, such as F and Pittsburgh alleles) and
null (undetectable serum level of AAT, QO alleles).
Deficient, dysfunctional and null variants are related
to clinical disease.
AAT serpinopathies (serpin-related diseases) can
affect lung and liver (1). Molecular pathology is com￾plex and includes intracellular accumulation of mutant
AAT, increased activity of proteolytic cascade, and
tissue damage due to the AAT extracellular deposits.
Among all the variants related to clinical disease,
mutations Z and S are the most common and are a
consequence of point mutations in the AAT gene.
The Z mutation (Glu342!Lys342) is present in 4%
of North Europeans and results in a severe decrease in
plasma AAT. In Z mutation homozygotes (Pi ZZ),
plasma AAT levels are decreased to 10%–15% of those
found in the normal M allele-carrying individuals.

In Z mutation carriers posttranslational modification
of AAT synthesis occurs, leading to accumulation of
polymers in the cisterna of the rough endoplasmic
reticulum and a reduction of AAT secretion. Aberrant
AAT protein accumulated in the rough endoplasmic
reticulum of the liver is seen as periodic acid-Schiff￾positive (PAS-positive), diastase-resistant inclusions.
Accumulated AAT aggregates in alpha-1-antitrypsin
deficiency (AATD) cause hepatocyte death and liver
disease, including juvenile liver cirrhosis and
development of hepatocellular car cinoma (2).
The S mutation (Glu264!Val264) found in up to
28% of South Europeans is not associated with clin￾ical disease, although AAT plasma levels are 60% of
those found in M allele carriers. In contrast to the
Z mutation, the S allele causes only mild plasma defi￾ciency due to reduced secretion of AAT. In these indi￾viduals newly synthesized AAT is degraded in the cell
prior to secretion (3,4). Nevertheless, individuals who
are SZ heterozygous (Pi SZ) have liver disease (5).
AATD is a genetic disorder that besides the above￾mentioned liver disease leads to lung injury and early
development of emphysema in adults and accounts for
1%–3% of all cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD) (6,7).
AATD in adults manifests as COPD in 60% of all
patients, while only 12% of adult patients have liver
cirrhosis. The simultaneous presence of COPD and
liver cirrhosis is rare.
The aim of our study was to determine the fre￾quency of AAT mutations in adults with severe liver
disease and assess if differences in liver function tests
related to the presence of Z allele exist.
Material and methods
We included 70 patients in the study group: 61 treated
for liver cirrhosis and 9 diagnosed with hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) at the Clinic for Gastroenterology
and Hepatology, Clinical Centre of Serbia. Diagnosis
was based on clinical features, laboratory tests, imag￾ing diagnostics, and liver histology whenever possible.
The Ethics Committee approved the study, and all
patients gave an informed consent prior to inclusion
into this investigation.
The following data were registered for each
patient: age, gender, aetiology of cirrhosis, biochem￾ical parameters (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine
aminotransferase, total bilirubin, serum albumin, pro￾thrombin activity, and platelet count), presence and
degree of oesophageal varices, and degree of liver
function impairment by Child-Pugh classes. Cirrhosis
aetiology was determined as viral if hepatitis B sur￾face antigen or hepatitis C serum markers were
positive. If viral markers were negative, and the history
obtained indicated alcohol consumption of at least
50 g per day in the past 5 years, liver cirrhosis was
considered as alcoholic. Positive immunological mar￾kers were characteristic for immunological liver dis￾ease. The other studied cases had liver cirrhosis of
different aetiology (Wilson’s disease, AATD, hae￾mochromatosis, etc.). Diagnosis of HCC was based
on imaging techniques (ultrasonography, computed
tomography, and NMR), as well as elevated alpha￾fetoprotein (AFP) and liver histology.
The Child-Pugh score was calculated using five
variables (ascites, encephalopathy, bilirubin, albumin,
and prothrombin time). Values of 1, 2, or 3 were
assigned to each of these variables due to increasing
abnormality, and the score calculated as the sum of
the five variables for each patient. A Child-Pugh score
less than 7 was considered class A, from 7 to 9 class B,
while and any score greater than 9 was class C.
One experienced endoscopist assessed varices using
a four-grade classification. Varices not arising from
surrounding mucosa were recognized as grade I, those
smaller than 5 mm fulfilling less than one-third of the
oesophageal lumen were recognized as grade II, grade
III were varices larger than 5 mm fulfilling more than
one-third of the oesophageal lumen, while grade IV
varices occupied more than two-thirds of the oeso￾phageal lumen. The presence of a mosaic pattern and
speckled red spots of the mucosa was termed portal
hypertensive gastropathy.
The control group consisted of 218 healthy blood
donors.
Blood samples were taken from the patients, sera
separated by centrifugation and stored at -80C until
analysed.
Pi phenotype was determined using the isoelectric
focusing (pH range 4.2–4.9) method described by
Kishimoto et al. (8).
Biochemical parameters and liver enzymes were
determined using routine laboratory methods.
Statistical analysis
The chi-square test was used to assess if the control
and study groups were in Hardy-Weinberg equilib￾rium for the AAT gene. Differences in frequency of
AAT phenotypes and alleles as well as Pi M homozy￾gosity and Pi M heterozygosity between study and
control groups were tested using a chi-square associ￾ation test (2  2 contingency table). If n < 5 we used
the Fisher exact test.
Population characteristics were analysed using
descriptive statistics and data shown as mean (inter￾quartile range). Differences between men and women
Alpha-1-antitrypsin phenotypes in adult liver disease patients 229

were evaluated by Mann-Whitney U-test. P-values of
<0.05 were considered as significant. For statistical
analysis, we used STATISTICA 6.0 software.
Results
Clinical and demographic data of the study group can
be seen in Table I. Significantly higher incidences of
smoking and alcohol consumption, but also positive
autoimmune markers, varices grade III, and portal
gastropathy were observed in male compared to
female patients.
The distribution of AAT phenotypes and AAT
alleles in the study group and controls are shown
in Table II. No deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equi￾librium was detected in controls (chi-square = 3.56;
df 11; P = 0.981), while in the study group deviation
from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (chi-square =
34.77, df 11, P = 0.000) was caused by an excess of
Pi ZZ homozygotes (f = 0.0143 and f = 0.0005, respec￾tively, P = 0.000).
Differences in the distributions of Pi phenotypes
and gene frequencies between patients and controls
are seen in Table III. In our study group Pi M1
homozygotes were more frequent than in controls
(f = 0.5429 and f = 0.4083 respectively, P = 0.048).
In the study group both Pi M1M3 and Pi M2M3
heterozygotes were less frequent than in the control
group (M1M3: f = 0.0714 and f = 0.1697 respecti￾vely, P = 0.035; fM2M3: f = 0.0000 and f = 0.0688,
respectively, P = 0.029).
Patients harboured the M1 allele more often than
did controls (f = 0.7214 and 0.6307, respectively,
P = 0.05). On the other hand, the M3 allele was less
frequent in patients than in controls (f = 0.0357 and
0.1330, respectively, P = 0.01),
Our results revealed differences in distribution
between Pi M homozygotes (Pi M1M1, Pi M2M2,
and Pi M3M3) and Pi M heterozygotes (Pi M1M2,
Pi M1M3, and Pi M2M3), with a higher prevalence of
Pi M homozygosity in the study group compared to
controls (63% and 46%, respectively, P = 0.025).
Our study did not reveal differences in liver enzyme
activity, severity of liver disease, and risk factors for
liver disease related to the presence of the Z allele in
our study group (Table IV).

importance. Risk of AATD-related liver disease in
childhood has been previously well documented.
Results of a large neonatal screening study by
Sveger (9) and other epidemiological studies
(10–14) demonstrated that Pi ZZ-carrying infants
have clinical signs of neonatal cholestasis and other
clinical symptoms of liver disease without jaundice.
Although the majority of children with AATD (83%)
are clinically healthy throughout childhood, it is esti￾mated that 14%–46% of all liver transplantation in
paediatric patients is due to liver failure caused by
AATD (15,16).
In adults the association of AATD and liver disease
is less clear than in children. In a recent review
Kok et al. (17) stated that adult Pi ZZ carriers had
a higher risk of developing end stage liver disease,
cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Heterozygous AATD is an important co-factor in
the aetiology of chronic liver disease, and it can mod￾ify the course of hepatitis C, end stage liver disease,
cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore
clarifying the association between heterozygous
AATD and liver disease in the adult population is
of clinical importance.
In our study 90% of patients had liver cirrhosis
of different aetiology, and 10% were diagnosed with
hepatocellular carcinoma.
Patients with liver disease had a higher frequency
of Pi ZZ homozygosity than expected, which caused
deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and sup￾ported the previously proposed association between
Pi ZZ genotype and severe liver disease. A large

retrospective study (2) demonstrated an increased risk
of cirrhosis and liver cancer in Pi ZZ individuals. In
addition, Elzouki and Eriksson (18) reported that
male, Pi ZZ homozygous individuals have a higher
risk of developing cirrhosis and HCC, independently
of hepatitis B or C infection. Our results in the study
group support these findings.
However, we failed to demonstrate a different
frequency of Pi ZZ homozygosity between patients
with liver disease and healthy individuals, probably
due to a relatively small number of patients in the
study group.
The possible role of the Z allele in the pathogenesis
of chronic liver disease in heterozygous AATD
patients is still controversial. Some studies provide
evidence of an association between the heterozygous
Z allele alpha-1-antitrypsin phenotype and end stage
liver disease of different aetiology (19–22), but
other studies (including ours) failed to identify
an association between heterozygous MZ alpha-1-
antitrypsin deficiency and cirrhosis (23–27). We were
not able to show differences in Pi MZ frequency
between patients and healthy controls. The study by
Rakela et al. (28) showed that liver disease became
symptomatic at the age of 58 years in Pi ZZ, 66 years
in Pi SZ, and 73 years in Pi MZ carriers. The mean
age of our Pi MZ carriers was 54 ± 11 years which
could explain why we could not confirm an association
between Pi MZ phenotype and liver disease.
We could not identify differences in the activity
of liver enzymes and the degree of liver failure
(Child-Pugh score, varices, and portal hypertensive
gastropathy) in patients relative to the presence of
Z allele.
According to our results, there is no difference
in aetiology of cirrhosis related to the presence of
Z allele carriers, implying that adult Z allele carriers
were not more sensitive to any of the known risk fac￾tors for liver disease. Results from our study partially
agree with the data from the literature. Vogel et al. (29)
documented that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is
an exogenous risk factor which is required for the
development of chronic liver disease in Z allele carriers
(homozygotes and heterozygotes), but hepatitis B
virus (HBV), alcohol abuse, and autoimmunity were
not risk factors. A recent study (19) showed that
AATD might be a risk factor for infected HBV indi￾viduals progressing from the carrier stage to chronic
and cirrhotic stages. Bowlus et al. (30) reported that
male gender and obesity, but not alcohol or viral
hepatitis, predispose to advanced liver disease in
adults with AATD.
Surprisingly, we report a significant difference in
distribution of Pi M subtypes between the patient and
control groups. This result is unexpected, because
Pi M subtypes are not AAT-deficient and not related
to clinical diseases. In our study Pi M1 homozygosity
was more frequent in patients than in the controls, and

both Pi M1M3 and Pi M2M3 heterozygosity was less
frequent in patients than in controls. Further analysis
of AAT allele frequency revealed that the M1 allele
was more frequent and the M3 allele less frequent in
patients than in controls. In most populations, the
M3 allele is less frequent compared to the M1 and M2
alleles, and the relatively small number of patients
included in our study could explain the reduced
frequency of M3 allele. It is interesting that
more M homozygosity was found in patients than
in the control group, which could be explained by the
advantages of Pi M heterozygosity in a healthy indi￾vidual. In addition, these findings suggest that M
homozygotes could be associated with liver disease
via some mechanism different from Z allele-induced
hepatocyte damage through accumulation of AAT
polymers, but this finding needs to be confirmed in
larger studies.
