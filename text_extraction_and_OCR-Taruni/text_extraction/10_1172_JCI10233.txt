Introduction
The development of chronic transplant dysfunction
(CTD) has become a limiting factor for long-term graft
survival and is today’s most important problem in clin￾ical organ transplantation after the first perioperative
year. To date, CTD cannot be prevented by current
immunosuppressive protocols (1, 2). Depending on the
type of organ transplanted (liver, kidney, heart, lung),
the incidence of CTD 3 years after engraftment varies
from 4 to >50% (3–5). Irrespective of the organ grafted,
graft vessels eventually develop so-called transplant
arteriosclerosis (TA), which is, however, most promi￾nent in cardiac allografts (6, 7). This vascular remodel￾ing process consists of progressive concentric intimal
thickening (intimal hyperplasia or neointima forma￾tion) coinciding with ongoing perivascular inflamma￾tion. TA has generally been accepted as the main cause
of progressive deterioration in graft function. Patho￾genesis of TA seems to be multifactorial, but precise
mechanisms involved in the development of this
remodeling process still remain obscure. Risk factors
appear to include cold ischemia time and reperfusion
injury, MHC disparity between donor and recipient,
number of rejection episodes, and infection (especially
by cytomegalovirus) (2, 6).
Current thought on the process of TA holds that in
response to signals from inflammatory cells (perivasculi￾tis) and activated or damaged graft endothelium donor￾derived medial vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells of
affected arteries start to proliferate and migrate from the
media into the subendothelial space just beneath the
endothelial cell (EC) layer (8–10). According to this con￾cept, neointimal ECs and VSM cells in TA originate from
graft tissue and are therefore donor-derived.
Since the early 1970s, several groups have studied the
origin of ECs (donor vs. recipient) after solid organ
transplantation (kidney, heart, and lung) in humans.
However, data both supporting (11–16) and discount￾ing (17–20) repopulation of graft vessels by recipient￾derived ECs were reported.
Graft survival rates are significantly improved after
solid organ transplantation since the introduction of
new immunosuppressive drugs in the last two decades.
From that time, not acute rejection but CTD and TA
have become a major problem in clinical organ trans￾plantation. To date, however, only a few studies have
addressed the question of whether the neointimal VSM
cells are indeed graft-derived (donor-derived), and
again, results conflict (20–24). So far, no conclusive
results have been described on the origin of ECs and
VSM cells after solid organ transplantation.
From previous studies in our laboratory, using small￾caliber vascular grafts of synthetic biodegradable bio￾material, we know that such artificial grafts allow de

The development of transplant arteriosclerosis (TA) is today’s most important problem in clinical organ
transplantation. Histologically, TA is characterized by perivascular inflammation and progressive inti￾mal thickening. Current thought on this process of vascular remodeling assumes that neointimal vas￾cular smooth muscle (VSM) cells and endothelium in TA are graft-derived, holding that medial VSM
cells proliferate and migrate into the subendothelial space in response to signals from inflammatory
cells and damaged graft endothelium. Using MHC class I haplotype-specific immunohistochemical
staining and single-cell PCR analyses, we show that the neointimal α-actin–positive VSM cells in rat aor￾tic or cardiac allografts are of recipient and not of donor origin. In aortic but not in cardiac allografts,
recipient-derived endothelial cells (ECs) replaced donor endothelium. Cyclosporine treatment prevents
neointima formation and preserves the vascular media in aortic allografts. Recipient-derived ECs do
not replace graft endothelium after cyclosporine treatment. We propose that, although it progresses
beyond the needs of functional repair, TA reflects the activity of a normal healing process that restores
vascular wall function following allograft-induced immunological injury.

novo formation of a new vessel wall (25, 26). In time, a
neointima and neomedia were found to develop inside
the lumen of the graft. Since the graft itself only con￾sists of synthetic material, the cellular components
forming the neomedia and the neointima, in this
model, must be recipient-derived. Based on these obser￾vations we hypothesized that also after regular allo￾geneic organ transplantation a similar process of de
novo vessel wall formation (vascular remodeling) will
occur in the arteries of the graft, constituting cells orig￾inating from the recipient (27).
To test this hypothesis, we used two experimental
transplant models. First, we used the allogeneic aorta
transplant model in rats, which is a well-described and
reproducible model to study TA (28). Second, we used a
cardiac transplant model in which MHC-incompatible
cardiac allografts are transplanted following intra￾thymic immune modulation and short-term immuno￾suppression (29). Cardiac allograft survival is signifi￾cantly prolonged, but development of TA in the
coronary artery (CA) tree cannot be prevented, resem￾bling clinical outcome after cardiac transplantation
(30). Using both transplant models we analyzed the ori￾gin of neointimal ECs and VSM cells, using MHC class
I haplotype-specific immunohistochemistry and two
independent PCR-based analyses (31, 32). Recipient￾and donor-specific PCR analyses were performed on 
70-µm-thick tissue samples, microdissected neointimal
cell clusters, and single-VSM-cell nuclei (aorta allo￾grafts), and on microdissected whole CAs and single￾VSM-cell nuclei (cardiac allografts). Similar analyses
were performed on aortic allografts that were γ-irradi￾ated prior to transplantation, and grafts from recipients
that were treated with cyclosporine (CsA).
Our results indicate that after allogeneic aorta trans￾plantation neointimal ECs and VSM cells are of recip￾ient and not of donor origin. CsA treatment prevented
neointima formation and preserved the vascular media.
After CsA treatment the ECs were still of donor origin
and had not been replaced by recipient-derived cells.
Although the neointimal VSM cells in cardiac allo￾grafts are of recipient origin, recipient-derived cells do
not replace donor ECs.
Thus, in contrast to current thought, VSM cells con￾stituting the hyperplastic neointima in aortic as well as
cardiac allografts are of recipient and not of donor ori￾gin. EC replacement is not a general phenomenon after
allogeneic organ transplantation and might be related
to the severity of the initial damage of graft endotheli￾um. We propose that TA is part of a normal healing
process trying to restore function of the damaged ves￾sel wall. Recipient-derived ECs and VSM cells are
involved in this repair process, which, however, does
not seem to be controlled adequately and eventually
may lead to total occlusion of the vessels.
Methods
Animals. Specific pathogen–free Lewis (Lew, RT-1l
),
Brown Norway (BN, RT-1n), Pibold Viral Glasco (PVG)
(RT-1c), and Albino Oxford (AO) (RT-1u) rats were
obtained from Harlan (Zeist, The Netherlands). The
rats were 7–10 weeks of age and were used for aorta
and cardiac transplantation. All transplantations were
performed from female donor to male recipient rats.
Animals were maintained under clean conventional
conditions and fed standard rat chow and acidified
water ad libitum. All animals received care in compli￾ance with NIH principles of laboratory animal care
and the Dutch Law on Experimental Animal Care.
Aorta transplantation. Aortic allografts (10–12 mm) were
transplanted orthotopically as described previously (28).
Total ischemic time was consistently less than 30 min￾utes. Transplantations were performed in the following
MHC-incompatible strain combinations: PVG to AO,
BN to Lew, and Lew to BN. Isograft controls consisted
of aortic grafts transplanted from AO to AO and BN to
BN rats. Grafts were removed at autopsy 1 month (BN
to Lew and Lew to BN) or 3 months (PVG to AO and iso￾graft controls) after transplantation and processed for
histological evaluation or microdissection.
Cardiac transplantation. Cardiac allografting was per￾formed from female PVG to male AO recipient rats. To
prevent acute rejection, recipient rats were intrathymi￾cally immune-modulated as described elsewhere (29).
Immediately after cardiac transplantation (day 0), 1 ml
rabbit anti-rat lymphocyte serum (Accurate Chemical &
Scientific Corp., Westbury, New York, USA) was injected
intraperitoneally. CsA (Sandoz Pharma AG, Basel,
Switzerland) was injected intramuscularly on days 1, 2,
and 3 after transplantation (15 mg/kg). Cardiac allografts
thus transplanted show significantly prolonged graft sur￾vival but eventually develop TA indicative of CTD (30).
Treatment groups. Aortic allografting was performed
from female PVG donor to male AO recipient rats. One
group was left untreated (n = 4), whereas in the other
group aortic allografts were ex vivo 50 Gy γ-irradiated
(137Cs, IBL 673; CIS Bio International Gif-Sur-Yvette,
France) prior to transplantation in order to prevent
proliferation and migration of donor-derived medial
VSM cells (n = 3). Three AO isograft controls were per￾formed (n = 3). To study the effect of CsA treatment on
the development of TA, another set of aorta trans￾plantations was performed in the female Lew to male
BN combination. Recipient rats received either no
treatment (n = 5) or CsA (Sandoz Pharma AG) at 5
mg/kg/d (n = 5) or 10 mg/kg/d (n = 4) for 28 days.
These concentrations were shown to reduce intimal
hyperplasia and preserve medial nuclear density after
allogeneic aorta transplantation in rats (33). CsA was
administered as a liquid in olive oil by intramuscular
injections. BN to Lew allografts (n = 3) and BN iso￾grafts (n = 5) served as control groups.
To analyze TA in cardiac allografts, three female￾derived PVG grafts were transplanted into male AO
recipient rats followed by intrathymic immune modu￾lation as described above (n = 3). Grafts were harvested
530 days (19 months) after transplantation and
processed for histological analysis and microdissection.

CsA blood levels. Twenty-four-hour trough whole
blood CsA levels were determined 2 and 4 weeks after
aortic transplantation. Blood was analyzed using the
Emit 2000 cyclosporine-specific assay (Dade Behring,
Marburg, Germany).
Immunohistochemical analyses. At the time of sacrifice,
the explanted aortic and cardiac grafts were either fixed
in Bouin’s fixative and embedded in paraffin or imme￾diately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80°C
for cryostat sections. For evaluation of vascular
changes, paraffin cross sections (7 µm) from the center
of the grafts were prepared, and double staining was
performed for elastin (Lawson solution; Klinipath,
Duiven, The Netherlands) and α-actin to detect neoin￾timal VSM cells in arteriosclerotic lesions. Briefly, 
α-actin–positive intimal cells were detected by an indi￾rect immunoperoxidase technique using mAb asm-1
directed against VSM cell α-actin isoform (34, 35)
(Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Almere, The Nether￾lands). Incubation with the primary asm-1 antibody
was followed by incubation with a second-step horse￾radish peroxidase–conjugated rabbit anti-mouse anti￾body (DAKO A/S, Glostrup, Denmark). Subsequently,
chromogen 3-amino-9-ethyl carbazole was applied, fol￾lowed by counterstaining with Mayer’s hematoxylin.
Sections were coverslipped with Kaiser’s glycerol gela￾tin (Merck, Amsterdam, The Netherlands).
To detect MHC class I expression on ECs and graft￾infiltrating inflammatory cells the following mAb’s
were used: OX18 (pan–class I) (36), OX27 (PVG [RT-1c
]
and BN [RT-1n] class I) (37), and U9F4 (AO [RT-1u] class
I) (38). To detect ECs and infiltrating macrophages,
mAb’s RECA-1 (39) and ED1 (40) were used, respective￾ly. MHC class I, EC, and macrophage staining was per￾formed on 7-µm cryostat sections using the DAKO
EnVision staining kit (DAKO A/S). Sections were coun￾terstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin and coverslipped
with Depex mounting medium (BDH Laboratory Sup￾plies, Poole, United Kingdom).
Quantitation of TA. After histological staining of tissue
sections for elastin and α-actin, presence of TA was
quantitated using a computerized morphometric
analysis system (QWin Software; Leica Microsystems
B.V., Rijswijk, The Netherlands). Total surface area of
arteriosclerotic lesions (neointima) was calculated and
expressed as µm2.
Microdissection of neointimal tissue. Microdissection of
neointimal tissue was performed on α-actin–stained 7-
µm cryostat sections (taken from the center of the graft)
from aortic as well as cardiac allografts. α-Actin stain￾ing ensured positive identification of neointimal VSM
cells in aortic allografts and affected CAs in cardiac allo￾grafts. After counterstaining with Mayer’s hematoxylin,
tissue sections were placed in PBS and stored overnight
at 4°C. Subsequently, microdissection was performed
using a micromanipulator (Leica Microsystems B.V.)
from neointimal lesions containing large numbers of 
α-actin–positive VSM cells. Cell clusters consisting of
20–30 cells were microdissected from neointimal lesions
in aortic allografts as well as in CAs. To prevent poten￾tial contamination of the cell clusters with infiltrating
mononuclear cells, single nuclei from α-actin–positive
neointimal cells in aortic allografts and CAs were
microdissected as well. For single cell picking, nuclei
were randomly selected among α-actin–positive cells
having an easily visible nucleus surrounded by 
α-actin–positively stained cytoplasm. Microdissected
cell clusters and isolated single nuclei were directly
transferred into PCR reaction tubes containing 20 µl
Milli-Q water (Millipore B.V., Etten-Leur, The Nether￾lands, USA) and stored at –20°C until PCR analysis.
PCR analyses. The first PCR that was used to analyze
the origin of neointimal cell types after aortic and car￾diac allografting was based on polymorphic regions
present in the Tap2 gene encoding a subunit of a pep￾tide transporter involved in loading of MHC class I
molecules with peptides (31). Because the Tap2 gene is
located within the MHC, all MHC haplotypes are asso￾ciated with a specific Tap2 allele. To determine the Tap2
genotype of isolated DNA, a PCR procedure developed
by Joly et al. was used based on differences in restriction
sites found in the sequences of the Tap2 cDNAs (31).
Oligonucleotides used were as follows: 360 5′-ccgggctc￾tagaTGCAGACCGTGAGAAGCTTTG-3′ and 361 5′-ccgggc￾gaattcCTGCACACCGACGTTCAGAAT-3′ (sequences in
lower case do not correspond to Tap2 sequences but
were introduced for cloning of the various alleles by
PCR). Since microdissected cell clusters and single
nuclei did not contain sufficient DNA to give a positive
signal (not shown), the Tap2 PCR was performed on
70-µm-thick tissue samples obtained from aortic allo￾grafts. In addition, microdissected CAs showing severe
TA from one graft were pooled (∼10–20 CAs) to get suf￾ficient template DNA to perform the Tap2 PCR. After
amplification, 10 µl of the PCR reaction mixture was
analyzed on a GelStar (BMA, Rockland, Maine, USA)
2% agarose gel. Sizes of the PCR products of the differ￾ent rat strains were: Lewis, 380 bp; BN, 360 bp; PVG,
340 bp; and AO, 360 bp.
Since all transplantations were performed in female
(donor) to male (recipient) combinations, we could also
use sex markers as indicators for cellular origin. There￾fore, a nested PCR procedure was developed that specifi￾cally enabled identification of a Y chromosome–associ￾ated DNA sequence (European Molecular Biology
Laboratory [EMBL]/GenBank data libraries accession no.
X80155) (41) at the single-cell level and thereby the (male)
origin of cells (described in detail elsewhere; ref. 32). The
following Y chromosome–specific oligonucleotides were
used: first round 5′-CAGGCTGGAAAGGCTTGTAG-3′ (for￾ward) and 5′-CCCATGTTTGGTCCACATAG-3′ (reverse),
and second round 5′-GCTGGTGATTTGCAGAGTGA-3′
(forward) and 5′-GAATGTTCGATTCCGACTGG-3′(reverse).
The first and second round of PCR amplification result￾ed in 549-bp and 128-bp DNA fragments, respectively.
After amplification, 10 µl of the 2nd round reaction mix￾ture was analyzed on a GelStar (BMA) 2% agarose gel. All
amplifications were carried out using an Amplitron II
The Journal of Clinical Investigation | June 2001 | Volume 107 | Number 11 1413

Thermolyne thermocycler (Barnstead/Ther￾molyne, Dubuque, Iowa, USA).
Restriction enzyme analysis. Since Tap2 PCR
fragments derived from Lew DNA bear a
HindIII restriction site and BN-derived DNA
fragments do not, further discrimination
between Lew- and BN-derived DNA could
be made by HindIII restriction analysis. After
Tap2 PCR analysis, 5 µl PCR product was
added to 5 µl restriction mix containing 5 U
HindIII (Life Technologies B.V., Breda, The
Netherlands). After incubation for 1 hour at
37°C, DNA samples were analyzed by 2% agarose gel
electrophoresis. Lew-derived DNA was cut into two
fragments (276 and 104 bp), whereas BN-derived
DNA remained uncut.
Since PVG- and AO-derived DNA both lack the
HindIII restriction site in their Tap2 sequence, dis￾crimination could only be made by difference in size
of the PCR products (340 and 360 bp respectively).
Therefore, those PCR products were electrophoresed
on a 12% polyacrylamide gel using a Mini-PROTEAN
II Bio-Rad system (Bio-Rad Laboratories B.V., Veenen￾daal, The Netherlands). After electrophoresis the gel
was soaked in ethidium bromide–containing TBE
buffer to visualize PCR products.
Statistical analysis. To analyze differences in surface
area of arteriosclerotic lesions for statistical signifi￾cance, a Mann-Whitney U test was performed using
SPSS 7.5.2 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, USA).
Differences were considered to be statistically signifi￾cant when P values were less than 0.05.
Results
Effect of irradiation and CsA treatment on TA. Transplan￾tation of fully MHC-mismatched aortic allografts in
the PVG to AO rat strain combination resulted in the
development of severe TA. Whereas AO isografts were
unaffected or only slightly affected, allografts showed
significant (P < 0.05) neointima formation 3 months
after transplantation, indicating that TA in this model
is mainly caused by an alloantigen-driven process (Fig￾ure 1a). We then asked whether aortic allografts, which
contain medial VSM cells that have lost migratory and
proliferative capacities, still lead to development of
neointimal lesions after transplantation. To answer
this question, PVG aortic allografts were ex vivo 50 Gy
γ-irradiated prior to engraftment into AO recipients. As
shown in Figure 1a γ-irradiated allografts developed
neointimal lesions to the same extent as nonirradiated
allografts, indicating that graft medial VSM cells prob￾ably do not contribute to the process of TA.
Subsequently, the influence of immunosuppressive
therapy on the development of TA after allogeneic
aorta transplantation was analyzed. Aortic grafts
were transplanted in the Lew to BN combination.
From previous studies it became obvious that severe
TA develops within 4 weeks after transplantation in
this strain combination (Figure 1b) (42). Recipient
rats received either no treatment or CsA at 5 mg/kg/d
or 10 mg/kg/d for 28 days. After 14 and 28 days, 24-
hour trough whole blood CsA levels were determined

in three animals from either group. No differences
were observed between the 14- and 28-day time
points, and therefore data from both time points
were pooled. Animals treated with 5 mg/kg/d and 10
mg/kg/d CsA had mean trough levels of 1016 ± 268
ng/ml and 2383 ± 327 ng/ml, respectively. The non￾treated group had trough levels below detection level
(<25 ng/ml). Treatment with 5 mg/kg/d and 10
mg/kg/d both resulted in complete inhibition of
neointima formation 28 days after transplantation 
(P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively) (Figure 1b). After
CsA treatment, no differences were observed com￾pared with the isograft (BN to BN) controls.
Representative micrographs of vascular wall mor￾phology are shown in Figures 1, c–f. The nontreated
group displayed severe neointima formation with pres￾ence of large numbers of α-actin–positive VSM cells
(Figure 1c). The media had become acellular, and medi￾al α-actin–positive VSM cells had disappeared. In addi￾tion, graft-infiltrating ED1+ macrophages were present
in both the adventitia and the neointima (Figure 1d).
After CsA treatment, however, morphology appeared to
be normal (no neointima formation) in both treatment
groups and was similar to nontransplanted aortic tissue.
Grafts from CsA-treated recipients were characterized by
a high nuclear density in the media, which appeared to be
α-actin–positive VSM cells (Figure 1, e and f).
Origin of ECs in nontreated and CsA-treated aorta recipients.
To analyze the origin (donor vs. recipient) of ECs after
allogeneic aorta transplantation, MHC class I haplo￾type-specific immunohistochemistry was performed
(Figure 2). PVG allografts transplanted in AO recipient
rats showed severe neointima formation 3 months after
transplantation (Figure 1a). Presence of ECs was con￾firmed by positive staining using mAb RECA-1 (not
shown). Serial tissue sections were stained using mAb’s
OX18, OX27, and U9F4. Neointimal ECs express MHC
class I antigens as indicated by intense staining with
mAb OX18 (pan–class I), whereas neointimal VSM cells
do not express MHC class I antigens sufficiently to
allow detection by this staining (Figure 2a). Note the
absence of nuclei in the media and the swollen appear￾The Journal of Clinical Investigation | June 2001 | Volume 107 | Number 11 1415

Neointimal ECs in aortic allografts are of recipient origin. Immunohistochemical staining using MHC class I haplotype-specific mAb’s was

endothelium had been replaced by recipient-derived ECs (OX27-positive). After CsA treatment, no neointima formation was observed 
1 month after transplantation. (f) ECs covering the internal elastic lamina expressed MHC class I antigens (OX18-positive). However, ECs

ance of the ECs. Staining with mAb OX27 (donor type)
was negative (Figure 2b), whereas mAb U9F4 (recipient
type) clearly showed positive staining of ECs (Figure 2c),
indicating that donor ECs had been replaced by recipi￾ent-derived ECs. Similar results were obtained after hap￾lotype-specific MHC class I staining of PVG allografts
that were 50 Gy γ-irradiated prior to transplantation
into AO recipient rats (not shown).
To further analyze whether EC replacement had also
taken place after CsA treatment, serial tissue sections
from aortic grafts transplanted in the Lew to BN strain
combination were stained using mAb’s OX18
(pan–class I) and OX27 (recipient type). Again, presence
of ECs was confirmed by positive staining using mAb
RECA-1 (not shown). Neointimal ECs from untreated
animals showed abundant MHC class I expression as
indicated by positive OX18 staining (Figure 2d). Also, in
this strain combination, donor endothelium had been
replaced by recipient-derived ECs as indicated by posi￾tive OX27 staining. MHC class I staining of aortic allo￾grafts transplanted in the reciprocal BN to Lew strain
combination confirmed these results (not shown). After
CsA treatment, however, donor endothelium was still
covering the internal elastic lamina and had not been
replaced by recipient-derived ECs. ECs express MHC
class I (positive staining using mAb OX18) (Figure 2f)
but lack positive staining using the recipient specific
mAb OX27 (Figure 2g).
Origin of ECs in cardiac allografts. Cardiac transplanta￾tion following intrathymic immune modulation result￾ed in development of severe TA in the CAs (30). To study
whether EC replacement by recipient-derived ECs had
also taken place in these cardiac allografts, recipient and
donor MHC class I–specific staining was performed. As
control tissue, normal cardiac AO-derived tissue was
used. Representative micrographs are shown in Figure
3. Results of normal AO cardiac tissue and PVG allo￾grafts are depicted in Figure 3, a–e and f–j, respectively.
VSM cell α-actin staining (Figure 3f) confirmed pres￾ence of severe neointima formation and luminal nar￾rowing in the CAs in PVG allografts explanted 530 days
after transplantation. RECA-1 staining showed pres￾ence of ECs (Figure 3, b and g). Note the swollen and
activated appearance of ECs covering the neointima in
the PVG allograft. OX18 (pan–class I) staining con￾firmed presence of MHC class I expression by ECs in
normal cardiac tissue and PVG allografts (Figure 3, c
and h). Neointima-infiltrating leukocytes were virtual￾ly absent in the arteriosclerotic lesions. However,
perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrates (MHC class
I–positive) were present in the PVG allografts. Staining
with recipient-specific mAb U9F4 showed positive
staining of the mononuclear cell infiltrates (which, as
expected, are recipient-derived) (Figure 3i). However, the
neointimal ECs in the PVG allografts are negative, sug￾gesting that, in contrast to aortic allografts, recipient
ECs have not replaced donor endothelium in CAs with
severe TA. This was confirmed by positive staining of
neointimal ECs with the donor-specific mAb OX27

Tap2 PCR analysis of aortic and cardiac tissue. Since
neointimal VSM cells do not express MHC class I anti￾gens sufficiently to allow MHC class I–specific
immunohistochemistry to study the origin of neointi￾mal VSM cells in aortic and cardiac allografts, another
(PCR-based) approach was followed to define the ori￾gin of α-actin–positive neointimal cells.
The first PCR that was used to analyze the origin of
neointimal cell types after aortic and cardiac allograft￾ing was based on polymorphic regions in the Tap2 gene.
Because of the relatively low sensitivity of the Tap2
PCR, analysis was performed on 70-µm-thick tissue
samples of aortic allografts transplanted in the BN to
Lew, Lew to BN, and Lew to BN + CsA (5 and 10
mg/kg/d CsA) combinations. Three individual grafts
from either group were included, and of each graft four
70-µm-thick tissue samples were analyzed. Nontrans￾planted BN and Lew aortic tissue served as controls for
specificity of this Tap2 PCR. As shown in Figure 4a,
control BN and Lew DNA resulted in DNA fragments
of 360 bp and 380 bp, respectively. Restriction analysis
with HindIII showed cleavage of the Lew-derived 380-
bp fragments into 276-bp and 104-bp fragments,
whereas the BN-derived 360-bp fragments remained
uncut, thereby proving the specificity of this Tap2 PCR.
Subsequently, this PCR was applied to tissue samples
obtained from grafts transplanted from BN donor to
Lew recipient rats. Tap2 PCR followed by HindIII
restriction showed cleavage of the DNA fragments into
two fragments, indicating Lew (recipient) origin of the
majority of the DNA present in these samples. This was
confirmed by analysis of tissue obtained from grafts
transplanted in the reciprocal combination (Lew to
BN). After HindIII restriction the DNA fragments
remained uncut, indicating BN (recipient) origin of the
DNA present in these samples. Finally, the same analy￾sis was performed on tissue from Lew grafts trans￾planted into BN recipient rats followed by CsA treat￾ment (5 mg/kg/d) for 28 days. HindIII restriction
showed cleavage of the DNA fragments into two frag￾ments, indicating Lew (donor) origin of the majority of
the DNA after CsA treatment (Figure 4a). Similar
results were obtained from analysis of aortic allografts
after treatment with 10 mg/kg/d CsA (not shown).
These results suggest that both neointimal ECs and
VSM cells are recipient-derived in aortic allografts.
To study whether the same holds true for neointimal
cells in cardiac allografts, Tap2 PCR analysis was per￾formed on microdissected CAs showing severe TA. To
obtain sufficient DNA, microdissected CAs from one
graft were pooled prior to PCR analysis. Since PVG￾and AO-derived DNA both lack the HindIII restriction
site in their Tap2 sequence, discrimination could only

be made by difference in size of the PCR products (340
and 360 bp, respectively). Analysis of one complete 7-
µm section of a cardiac allograft showed presence of
donor-derived (PVG, 340 bp) as well as recipient￾derived (AO, 360 bp) DNA fragments (Figure 5a). Sub￾sequent analysis of pooled microdissected CAs, includ￾ing donor myocardial tissue, again showed presence of
both donor- and recipient-derived DNA fragments.
Finally, 20 CAs of one graft were microdissected with￾out contamination with donor-derived myocardial tis￾sue. Again, recipient-derived (360 bp), and now to a
lesser extent donor-derived (340 bp), DNA fragments
were present (Figure 5a). These results suggest that
after cardiac allografting, neointimal tissue consists, at
least in major part, of recipient-derived cells.
HY PCR analysis of microdissected neointimal aortic tissue
and CAs. Since the sensitivity of the Tap2 PCR was not
sufficient to analyze microdissected cell clusters
(∼20–30 cells) and single CAs, another, more sensitive,
PCR-based analysis was developed as described in
detail elsewhere (32). This highly sensitive and specif￾ic nested PCR procedure enabled the identification at
the single-cell level of a 128-bp Y chromosome–associ￾ated DNA sequence and thereby of the (male) origin of
cells. Since aortic and cardiac allografting was per￾formed not only between MHC-incompatible rat
strains but in a female (donor) to male (recipient) com￾bination as well, we could use this HY marker as an
indicator for male cellular origin.
First, this PCR was applied to microdissected cell
clusters derived from neointimal lesions in aortic allo￾grafts with or without 50 Gy γ-irradiation transplant￾ed from female PVG donor to male recipient rats. Three
individual grafts of either group were studied, and of
each graft five microdissected cell clusters were ana￾lyzed. HY PCR performed on microdissected cell clus￾ters resulted in appearance of Y chromosome–specific
DNA fragments in the nonirradiated as well as the 50
Gy γ-irradiated aortic allografts (Figure 4b). First￾round PCR already resulted in detectable amounts of
specific DNA fragments (549 bp). Additional nested
PCR confirmed this observation by the amplification
of a 128-bp DNA fragment. Subsequently, this PCR
was applied to microdissected single CAs obtained
from three cardiac allografts. Of either graft, four sin￾gle CAs (with severe TA) were microdissected and ana￾lyzed individually for the presence of male-derived
(recipient-derived) cells. All samples analyzed showed
the male-specific DNA fragments after the first round,
as well as after nested PCR. Representative results of
the nested PCR performed on three individual CAs
microdissected from three different grafts, as well as
specificity controls (male- and female-derived DNA),
are shown in Figure 5b. Results obtained with the 
HY-specific as well as with the Tap2 PCR thus indicate
the presence of recipient-derived cells, both in
microdissected neointimal cell clusters obtained from
aortic allografts and in microdissected whole CAs
showing severe TA. However, although neointimal tis￾sue predominantly consists of α-actin–positive VSM
cells (Figures 1c and 3f), neointimal lesions can also
contain an appreciable number of recipient-derived
infiltrating leukocytes, especially macrophages (43).
The neointimal lesions present in aortic allografts in
this study indeed contained considerable numbers of
ED1+ macrophages (Figure 1d). Neointimal lesions in
CAs appeared to contain few if any infiltrating inflam￾matory cells (Figure 3); however, one cannot exclude
the possibility that such inflammatory cells were pres￾ent. Since the HY PCR is sufficiently sensitive to detect
male-derived cells on the single-cell level, false-positive
results could be obtained by neointima-contaminating
recipient-derived inflammatory cells.

recipient (AO, 360 bp) DNA. Analysis of 11 pooled CAs including
(donor-derived) myocardial tissue again showed presence of donor￾as well as recipient-derived DNA. Analysis of 20 pooled CAs without

DNA. (b) HY PCR analysis of three single CAs that were microdis￾sected from three different female-derived PVG cardiac allografts

after nested PCR analysis, indicating presence of recipient-derived
cells. (c) HY PCR performed on eight single nuclei microdissected

diac allografts. α-Actin staining ensured positive iden￾tification of neointimal VSM cells and prevented
potential contamination of our samples with intima￾infiltrating inflammatory cells.
Aortic allografts. Figure 4c shows a representative
micrograph of an aortic allograft with TA after isola￾tion of three VSM cell nuclei. First, PCR analysis was
performed on nuclei isolated from allografts
exchanged between male rats for both donor and recip￾ient. As now neointimal VSM cells, by definition, were
of male origin, we could test the efficacy of the isola￾tion procedure and subsequent PCR analysis. In total,
13 isolated nuclei from two grafts were analyzed, of
which 12 (92.3%) showed the Y chromosome–specific
(male-specific) 128-bp DNA fragment (not shown).
Subsequently, the same procedure was performed on
nuclei isolated from female PVG grafts transplanted
into male AO recipients. Three grafts were analyzed,
and from each graft eight nuclei were isolated. PCR
analysis revealed that 21/24 (87.5%) of the samples con￾tained DNA and, of these, 19/21 (90.5%) displayed the
male-specific 128-bp DNA fragment. These results
indicate that at least 90% of α-actin–positive VSM cells
in transplant arteriosclerotic lesions after allogeneic
aorta transplantation are of recipient origin.
Coronary arteries. Subsequently, this PCR was applied
to single nuclei microdissected from CAs showing
severe TA. Again, three grafts were analyzed and from
each graft eight nuclei were isolated. After allogeneic
cardiac transplantation, neointimal α-actin–positive
VSM cells are recipient-derived. Figures 4d and 5c
show representative results of the HY PCR applied to
microdissected single nuclei from aortic and cardiac
allografts, respectively.
The nucleotide sequence of the 128-bp PCR products
was determined to confirm the Y-chromosomal nature
of the amplified material. The obtained sequences were
compared with the sequence data available from
EMBL/GenBank data libraries, accession no. X80155
(clone 9.1ES8). The sequence data of the PCR products
were identical to the sequence data available from the
database, indicating that the 128-bp DNA fragment
belongs to the Y chromosome (not shown).
Discussion
CTD is the primary cause of allograft loss after the first
perioperative year and is today’s most important prob￾lem in clinical organ transplantation. The hallmark of
CTD is development of TA; i.e., progressive intimal
thickening (neointima formation) consisting of 
α-actin–positive VSM cells intermingled with recipient￾derived mononuclear cells (T cells and macrophages)
(2). Current thought on the process of TA holds that
medial VSM cells of affected arteries migrate into the
subendothelial space and start to proliferate, leading to
vascular narrowing and occlusion (2, 9, 10, 44). In this
paper, we analyzed whether neointimal VSM cells as
well as ECs are truly donor-derived, using two trans￾plant models (aorta and heart) in rats (28, 29). To
address this question, donor and recipient MHC class
I haplotype-specific immunohistochemistry and PCR
analyses of DNA sequences allowing discrimination
between donor and recipient origin were performed.
First we analyzed development of TA after transplan￾tation of aortic grafts that were ex vivo 50 Gy γ-irradi￾ated (to inhibit proliferation and migration of medial
VSM cells) prior to transplantation. It has been shown
that γ-irradiation of cultured VSM cells in vitro inhibits
proliferation of these cells after stimulation (45). Three
months after transplantation, irradiated grafts showed
severe TA, similar to nonirradiated grafts, suggesting
recipient origin of neointimal cells. Aziz et al. per￾formed similar experiments using liquid nitrogen to
destroy medial VSM cells in aortic allografts prior to
transplantation. These frozen allografts showed TA to
the same extent as unmodified grafts, also suggesting
recipient origin of neointimal cells (22).
Subsequently, aorta recipients were treated with 
5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg CsA for 28 days to study the
effect of immunosuppressive treatment on the devel￾opment of TA. CsA treatment completely blocked
neointima formation and preserved the vascular media,
confirming that development of TA is primarily alloim￾mune-mediated. Neointima formation is dependent
on, and proportional to, the extent of medial VSM cell
damage (46). By suppressing the alloimmune response
by CsA treatment, no medial VSM cell (and possibly
also no EC) damage occurs; thereby development of TA
is prevented. However, Stoltenberg et al. showed that
administration of the same amounts of CsA, resulting
in similar 24-hour CsA trough levels, resulted in sig￾nificant inhibition, but no prevention of neointima
formation 3 and 6 months after aorta transplantation
in the A×Cgg35Irish (ACI) to Lew strain combination
(33). Differences between the rat strains used and the
follow-up period might explain the different results.
To confirm the origin (donor vs. recipient) of neoin￾timal endothelial and VSM cells in rat aortic allografts
displaying extensive TA, we first performed recipient
MHC class I specific immunohistochemistry. Results
indicate that ECs indeed are of recipient origin in
nontreated and irradiated aortic allografts. CsA treat￾ment prevented neointima formation, and MHC class
I staining showed that ECs layering the internal elas￾tic lamina are still of donor type and are not being
replaced by recipient-derived ECs. In contrast to the
aortic allografts, neointimal ECs are still of donor
type in cardiac allografts showing severe TA 530 days
after engraftment. Similar results were found by
Hasegawa et al. (47), who showed that after MHC￾mismatched cardiac allografting in mice ECs in CAs
with neointimal lesions are still of donor origin at 12
weeks after transplantation by using MHC class
II–specific immunohistochemistry.
The origin of ECs (donor vs. recipient) after organ
allografting has been debated since Woodruff (48) and
Medawar (49) suggested that replacement of donor ECs
with recipient ECs (graft adaptation) might be an

important factor in establishing transplantation toler￾ance in long-term allograft survivors. Since then, sever￾al groups reported data supporting (11–16) and dis￾counting (17–20, 24) repopulation of graft vessels by
recipient-derived ECs after solid organ transplantation
(kidney, heart, and lung) (reviewed in ref. 50). Taken
together, results from literature and data presented in
this paper suggest that EC replacement is not a general
phenomenon after allogeneic organ transplantation. In
the absence of immunosuppression, donor ECs become
necrotic and disappear within 2 weeks after allogeneic
aorta transplantation in rats (21, 24). This severe dam￾age of donor ECs might explain the repopulation of the
graft with recipient-derived endothelium. After cardiac
transplantation following intrathymic immune modu￾lation and short-term immunosuppression, remaining
alloreactivity against graft endothelium as well as
alloimmune-independent factors do not result in suf￾ficient EC damage leading to EC replacement. Recent￾ly, we reported that after intrathymic immune modu￾lation the intragraft cytokine profile in long-term
allografts (>200 days) has shifted from a Th1 type (high
IL-2 and IFN-γ) toward a Th3 or Tr1 type (high IFN-γ,
TGF-β, and IL-10; no IL-2) profile. This altered
immune response might preserve graft endothelium,
but it does not prevent the development of TA (30).
Studying human kidney biopsies, Lagaaij et al. recently
suggested a correlation between the degree of EC
replacement by recipient-derived endothelium and the
severity of vascular rejection (16). Replacement of
donor endothelium by recipient-derived ECs seems to
be related to graft dysfunction, rather than to graft
function as suggested by Woodruff and Medawar (48,
49), and seems to play a role in endothelial repair
processes upon (severe) vascular injury.
The origin of the neointimal VSM cells in the arte￾riosclerotic lesions still remains questionable. The origi￾nal paradigm concerning the development of TA implies
intimal hyperplasia to be derived from the donor media
(8). This is supported by findings of Hruban et al., who
showed donor origin of neointimal VSM cells in two
patients using fluorescence in situ hybridization on tis￾sue sections (20). However, data have also been reported
indicating recipient origin of neointimal VSM cells in
experimental transplant models (21–23). MHC class I
haplotype-specific immunochemistry did not allow dis￾tinction between donor and recipient origin of neointi￾mal VSM cells in our transplant models, since both
neointimal and medial α-actin–positive VSM cells do not
express sufficient amounts of MHC class I antigens for
detection. A similar lack of expression has been described
for MHC class II antigens on neointimal VSM cells (47).
Therefore we addressed the question of whether
neointimal VSM cells are truly graft-derived using two
unrelated PCR-based analyses (Tap2 and HY) on aortic
and cardiac allografts, enabling discrimination
between donor and recipient-derived cells.
Using both types of PCR analysis on aortic allografts
and microdissected CAs with severe TA, we found that
at least a significant part of the cells in these tissues dis￾plays recipient-type DNA. Similar data were obtained
for irradiated aortic allografts. However, neointimal
lesions have been reported to contain an appreciable
number of recipient-derived infiltrating leukocytes (43).
Also, the aortic allografts analyzed in this study con￾tained neointima-infiltrating mononuclear cells, con￾sisting predominantly of ED1+ macrophages and some
T cells. Such contaminating recipient-derived leuko￾cytes can account for the recipient-specific signal in our
analysis of aortic allografts and microdissected CAs,
especially for the male-specific analysis, since the HY
PCR is much more sensitive than the Tap2 PCR. Simi￾lar problems may also have influenced the results of
Plissonnier et al. (21) and more recently Brazelton et al.
(23) on the origin of VSM cells in vascular allografts.
These groups used allospecific immunofluorescent
staining of cell suspensions (21) and tissue sections (23)
of aortic and femoral arterial allografts. Although their
conclusion, that neointimal VSM cells are of recipient
origin, in itself is probably correct, their type of analysis
cannot distinguish between the infiltrating (recipient￾derived) leukocytes and neointimal VSM cells.
Since our male-specific nested HY PCR allows detec￾tion of male-derived cells at the single-cell level (32), we
analyzed microdissected single nuclei of neointimal
VSM cells. Nuclei were isolated from neointimal lesions
of both aortic allografts and CAs with severe TA by pos￾itive selection (α-actin staining), thereby eliminating
the risk of contaminating our samples with infiltrating
recipient-derived mononuclear cells. HY PCR analysis
of single nuclei of α-actin–positive neointimal cells
showed that at least 90% of these cells in neointimal
lesions of both aortic allografts and CAs from cardiac
allografts are of recipient origin.
Although Hasegawa et al. claim that VSM cells in
neointimal lesions of CAs after cardiac transplantation
in mice are probably still of donor origin at 12 weeks
after transplantation, their type of analysis, MHC class
II specific immunohistochemistry, does not allow
determination of origin of neointimal VSM cells
because of lack of MHC class II antigen expression on
these neointimal VSM cells (47).
Since our data show recipient origin of neointimal
VSM cells (aortic and cardiac allografts) and endotheli￾um (aortic allografts), the question arises: what is the
anatomical origin of these neointimal cells? Kouchi et
al. demonstrated bloodstream origin of endothelial and
α-actin–positive smooth muscle cells present on Dacron
grafts transplanted in dogs (51). Recently, recirculating
bone marrow–derived CD34+ EC progenitor cells
(EPCs) have been identified in the peripheral blood of
humans (52, 53). The frequency of circulating EPCs
increases in response to regional ischemia in both mice
and rabbits. This increased frequency of circulating
EPCs contributes to neovascularization of ischemic
regions (54), indicating that EPCs are mobilized from
the bone marrow into the circulation and subsequently
“home” to sites needing neovascularization. Using bone
1420 The Journal of Clinical Investigation | June 2001 | Volume 107 | Number 11

marrow chimeric dogs, Shi et al. demonstrated donor
(bone marrow) origin of ECs attached on implanted
Dacron grafts, also indicating existence of circulating
bone marrow–derived ECs (55). In another study, Bhat￾tacharya et al. recently showed enhanced re-endothe￾lialization of Dacron grafts after seeding with bone mar￾row–derived CD34+ cells prior to implantation (56).
Taken together, these results suggest an important role
for bone marrow–derived CD34+ progenitor cells as a
source for ECs.
The anatomical source of the neointimal VSM cells is
still unknown. One possibility might be ingrowth of
medial VSM cells from the recipient side of anastomo￾sis, as suggested by Aziz et al. (22). VSM cell destruction
by freezing the recipient aortic ends at both sides near
the anastomosis resulted in less pronounced intimal
thickening compared with untreated aortic allografts.
However, the frozen recipient aortic ends remained
devoid of α-actin–positive VSM cells during the obser￾vation period of 60 days. If the neointimal VSM cells
originate from the recipient media, one should expect
migration of α-actin–positive VSM cells along the
frozen aortic ends toward the mid-graft region. This
was, however, not clear from the study by Aziz et al (22).
A second possibility is transdifferentiation from ECs
into α-actin–positive VSM cells. Studying quail
embryos, de Ruiter et al. showed transdifferentiation of
embryonic ECs into α-actin–expressing mesenchymal
cells in vivo and in vitro (57).
The third possibility for the anatomical origin of
neointimal VSM cells is the existence of VSM progeni￾tor cells that differentiate into α-actin–positive VSM
cells. Circulating VSM progenitor cells, however, have
not been identified so far. Bucala et al. reported the exis￾tence of a non–bone marrow–derived circulating cell
population with fibroblast properties that specifically
enters sites of tissue injury (58). In addition, Kouchi et
al. described the presence of α-actin–positive smooth
muscle cells on Dacron grafts, which apparently origi￾nated from the bloodstream (51). Using whole vessel
wall organ cultures, Slomp et al. showed migration of
adventitial myofibroblasts to the luminal surface, where
they transdifferentiated into endothelial-like cells as
well as into a VSM cell phenotype in intimal thickening
(59). These results suggest the existence of a myofi￾broblast cell lineage that can serve as an endothelial and
smooth muscle stem cell population. In our aortic
transplant model, sequential immunohistological
analysis of developing TA at an early stage after trans￾plantation indeed suggests a blood-borne influx of
regenerating VSM cells (not shown).
In conclusion, in contrast to current thought about
the process of TA, the α-actin–positive VSM cells in the
hyperplastic neointima in aortic and cardiac allografts
are of recipient and not of donor origin. Neointimal
ECs in aortic allografts are replaced by recipient￾derived endothelium, whereas in cardiac allografts
neointimal ECs are not replaced and are still of donor
origin. So, independent of EC replacement, donor VSM
cells in the graft are replaced by VSM cells of recipient
origin in these two transplant models.
We propose that the development of TA is an
attempt to restore vascular function upon immuno￾logical injury (alloreactivity) and is essentially part of
a normal healing process. Basically, as a result of the
immunological injury, medial VSM cells disappear,
leaving the elastin network as a scaffold allowing
restoration of the vessel wall by recipient-derived cells.
However, in TA this remodeling does not seem to stop,
eventually leading to total occlusion of the vessels
involved. According to this concept, at least two win￾dows in time seem to exist that would allow therapeu￾tic intervention to prevent the development of severe
TA. The first is early after transplantation, when pri￾mary vascular graft damage through either ischemia
or alloreactivity should be preventable. Perhaps cur￾rent immunosuppressive therapies should even be
intensified or adapted to suppress nonclinical rejec￾tion episodes causing vascular damage eventually lead￾ing to TA. The second window for intervention would
be later, when TA starts to develop. Our data suggest
that TA is the result of a repair process proceeding
beyond the needs of functional repair. Future inter￾vention strategies at this stage should aim at regaining
proper control of this dysregulated process.
