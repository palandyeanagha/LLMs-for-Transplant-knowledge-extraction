Abstract Background Hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) and portal vein thrombosis (PVT) are
serious causes of morbidity and mortality after pediatric liver transplantation. To
reduce thrombotic complications, routine antithrombotic therapy consisting of 1 week
heparin followed by 3 months acetylsalicylic acid, was implemented in our pediatric
liver transplant program in 2003. This study aimed to evaluate incidences of bleeding
and thrombotic complications since the implementation of routine antithrombotic
therapy and to identify risk factors for these complications.
Methods This retrospective cohort study includes 200 consecutive pediatric primary
liver transplantations performed between 2003 and 2016. Uni- and multivariate
logistic regression analysis, Kaplan–Meier method, and Cox regression analysis were
used to evaluate recipient outcome.
Results HAT occurred in 15 (7.5%), PVT in 4 (2.0%), and venous outflow tract
thrombosis in 2 (1.0%) recipients. Intraoperative vascular interventions (odds ratio
[OR] 14.45 [95% confidence interval [CI] 3.75–55.67]), low recipient age (OR 0.81
[0.69–0.95]), and donor age (OR 0.96 [0.93–0.99]) were associated with posttrans￾plant thrombosis. Clinically relevant bleeding occurred in 37%. Risk factors were high
recipient age (OR 1.08 [1.02–1.15]), high Child–Pugh scores (OR 1.14 [1.02–1.28]),
and intraoperative blood loss in mL/kg (OR 1.003 [1.001–1.006]). Both posttransplant

Introduction
In both adult and pediatric patients with end-stage liver
disease, the only curative treatment is liver transplantation.
Over the past decades patient and graft survival rates have
significantly improved, with 5-year patient and graft survival
of 80 to 95% in contemporary series.1–6 However, bleeding as
well as thrombosis still complicate liver transplantation and
contribute to significant morbidity and mortality.
The liver plays a central role in hemostasis, as it produces
pro- and anticoagulant as well as pro- and antifibrinolytic
factors and thrombopoietin. In patients with a liver disease,
concurrent changes in both pro- and antihemostatic path￾ways occur, resulting in a new hemostatic balance.7,8 This
“rebalanced hemostasis,” though, is fragile and can easily be
tipped toward thrombosis or bleeding,9,10 especially during
liver transplantation when levels of pro- and antihemostatic
factors decrease even further.11,12
In pediatric liver transplantation, the reported incidence of
posttransplant hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) varies be￾tween 5 and 18%, which is almost four times as frequent
when compared with adults, and 5 to 10% of patients develop
portal vein thrombosis (PVT).13–16 We previously reported a
high incidence (20%) of posttransplant vascular complications
in a cohort study (1982–1999) in our pediatric liver transplant
population.17 The high incidence of thrombotic complications
after pediatric liver transplantation is incompletely under￾stood, but may be related to disease etiology, differences in
plasma levels of hemostatic proteins children compared with
adults, and discrepancy in vessel diameters between donor
and recipient.17–19
Posttransplant bleeding complications occur in 5 to 20% of
the pediatric recipients.20,21 Improved surgical techniques,
combined with anesthesiological strategies as restrictive
transfusion, have reduced the bleeding risk significantly.12,22
Despite this, excessive bleeding can still profoundly affect
individual liver transplant recipients, warranting proactive
hemostatic management.
To reduce the number of thrombotic complications, a routine
posttransplant antithrombotic therapy protocol, consisting of
1 week continuous intravenous administration of unfractio￾nated heparin, followed by 3 months oral acetylsalicylic acid,
was implemented in our center in 2003. The aim of this study
was to assess the incidence of posttransplant thrombotic and
bleeding complications in pediatric recipients since the imple￾mentation of routine antithrombotic therapy and to identify
risk factors for these complications.
Methods
Study Design and Setting
We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study of all
pediatric patients ( 16 years) who underwent a primary liver
transplantation at the University Medical Center Groningen,
the Netherlands, between January 2003 and December 2016.
Electronical medical records were used to collect patient
demographic data, including age, gender, indication for trans￾plantation, and relevant medical history. Also, donor charac￾teristics were identified. Transplant-specific details such as
ischemia times and liver graft type and weight were obtained,
as well as technical and clinical intraoperative details, such as
implantation technique and type of anastomoses.
Postoperative outcome data including bleeding and throm￾botic complications were collected up to 3 months after liver
transplantation, along with perioperative administered blood
products. Patient and graft survival were analyzed up to
10 years after transplantation. The study protocol was a priori
approved by the Medical Ethical Research Board (2017.316)
and adhered to the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki.
Technical Aspects
Liver grafts were derived from both deceased and living
donors. Deceased donors included mainly donation after
brain death, but full-size grafts from pediatric donors after
circulatory death (DCD) were accepted as well. Adult full-size
grafts were divided by split or reduction procedures.
Liver grafts were implanted by using classical implantation
or piggyback technique. Portal vein reconstructions were
performed using end-to-end portal anastomoses with running
monofilament sutures. In case of vessel diameter discrepancy
or a hypoplastic portal vein, venous interposition grafts were
used. Arterial anastomoses were conducted end-to-end with
interrupted monofilament sutures, mostly between recipi￾ents’ common or proper hepatic artery and the donor common
hepatic artery in case of full-size grafts and left hepatic artery
in left partial liver grafts. All surgeons used magnifying loops
during the entire procedure. Biliary reconstructions for partial
grafts were conducted with a Roux-and-Y hepaticojejunos￾tomy, for full-size grafts a duct-to-duct anastomosis was
preferred. Immunosuppressive therapy consisted of triple
thrombotic (hazard ratio [HR] 3.38 [1.36–8.45]; p ¼ 0.009) and bleeding complications
(HR 2.50 [1.19–5.24]; p ¼ 0.015) significantly increased mortality.
Conclusion In 200 consecutive pediatric liver transplant recipients receiving routine
postoperative antithrombotic therapy, we report low incidences of posttransplant
vascular complications. Posttransplant antithrombotic therapy seems to be a valuable
strategy in pediatric liver transplantation. Identified risk factors for bleeding and
thrombotic complications might facilitate a more personalized approach in antith￾rombotic therapy.

therapy including tacrolimus (Prograft), with basiliximab
(Simulect), and prednisone as induction, supplemented with
mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept) in case of renal dysfunction.
All recipients, independent of type of primary disease or
type of arterial reconstruction, were treated according to
the routine antithrombotic therapy protocol, which was
implemented in 2003. Before 2003, no standard thrombotic
prophylaxis was administered in pediatric patients undergoing
liver transplantation. The antithrombotic protocol consisted of
1 week continuous intravenous unfractionated heparin,
followed by 3 months oral acetylsalicylic acid (►Fig. 1). Pro￾phylactic vitamin K was administered as well. Heparin was
started in the postreperfusion phase during liver transplanta￾tion or immediately afterwards, depending on intraoperative
bleeding or thrombotic complications and coagulation state. If
the prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplas￾tin time (APTT) levels were below 20 and 50 seconds, respec￾tively, and the platelet count was above 30 109
/L, heparin was
started at 10 U/kg/hour, with subsequent dose adjustments
guided by APTT levels, targeting 50 to 65 seconds. When a
patient received intravenous heparin, antithrombin III (AT-III)
levels were routinely monitored and AT-III concentrate was
administered when AT-III levels were < 60%. The APTT goal for
patients receiving intravenous heparin was independent from
hemoglobin (Hb)levels. Hblevelswere routinelymonitored and
red blood cells were routinely transfused when levels were< 4
mmol/L. Normotensive to supranormal (up to 20%) blood
pressures were pursued. AT-III, Hb, and blood pressure targets
did not change during the study period. Similar to our policy for
adult patients,10 we used a restricted transfusion policy for
blood products and prohemostatic blood products were never
administered based on the results of routine coagulation tests

(i.e., PT, APTT) alone. Only in the presence of excessive, nonsur￾gical bleeding problems, coagulation tests were used to direct
transfusion of prohemostatic blood products (i.e., fresh frozen
plasma, fibrinogen concentrate). Doppler-ultrasounds were
conducted at three standardized moments during liver trans￾plantation (before and after abdominal closure, and after arrival
at the pediatric intensive care unit), daily in thefirst postopera￾tive week and weekly afterwards until discharge.
Definitions and Variables
A posttransplant bleeding complication was defined as a
bleeding requiring blood transfusion or reintervention,
within 3 months after liver transplantation. A posttransplant
thrombotic complication was defined as a clinically sus￾pected thrombosis including HAT, PVT, and venous outflow
tract obstruction, confirmed at diagnostic imaging or surgi￾cal exploration, within 3 months after liver transplantation.
Patient survival was defined as time from liver transplan￾tation to death or end of follow-up (10 years after baseline or
December 31, 2017). Graft survival was defined as time
between date of transplantation and date of graft failure,
death, or end of follow-up. Recipients with and without a
posttransplant thrombotic complication were compared, as
well as recipients with and without a posttransplant bleed￾ing complication.
Statistical Analysis
Continuous data are presented as mean (standard deviation)
or median (interquartile range [IQR]), where appropriate.
Categorical variables are presented as number (percentage).
To test for differences between recipients with and without
posttransplant thrombotic/bleeding complications, two￾sample independent t-tests or Mann–Whitney U test and
Pearson’s chi-square tests or Fisher’s exact test were used for
continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Patient
and graft survival rates were determined by the Kaplan–
Meier method and compared with log rank testing.
In addition, multivariable logistic regression and Cox
regression analysis were performed using a backward stepwise
selection strategy, including variables with p-values < 0.20 in
the univariate analysis. The proportion of missing data was
< 5% for all variables used in regression models. Data were
presented as odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs). All reported p-values are two-tailed
and considered statistically significant if< 0.05. Statistical
analyses were performed using IBM Statistics SPSS, version
23 (IBM Inc., Chicago, Illinois, United States).
Results
Baseline Characteristics
A total of 200 pediatric recipients underwent a primary liver
transplantation in our center between 2003 and 2016 and
were included in this study. Recipients had a median age of
2.6 (IQR 0.8–9.5) years and weight of 14.2 (9.1–30.4) kg at
time of transplantation; 52% were male. Main indications for
liver transplantation were biliary atresia (51%) and metabolic
liver diseases (15%). Prior to transplantation, 6 (3.0%) recip￾ients had a preexisting PVT and 56 (28%) experienced a
bleeding event before transplantation, mainly due to esoph￾ageal varices (►Table 1).
Fifty-six (28%) full size and 144 (72%) partial grafts were
derived from 161 (80%) deceased and 39 (20%) living donors.
Five full-size DCD grafts were transplanted, derived from
pediatric donors aged 1 to 13 years. Deceased donor grafts
were divided via split (n ¼ 43) or reduction (n ¼ 62) proce￾dures into left lateral lobe (n ¼ 69), left lobe (n ¼ 29), right
lobe (n ¼ 5), or right trisegmental grafts (n ¼ 2). Living donor
grafts concerned mainly left lateral lobes (n ¼ 38) and one left
lobe. Median graft/recipient weight ratio was 2.7%
(2.0–3.3%). A piggyback implantation was used in 94% of
the transplantations, whereas 6% of grafts were classically
implanted. Median intraoperative blood loss was 71
(42–142) mL/kg. Median cold ischemia time (CIT) and
warm ischemia time (WIT) were 456 (351–571) and 43
(36–51) minutes, respectively (►Table 2).
Posttransplant Thrombotic Complications
A posttransplant thrombotic complication occurred in 21
(11%) recipients, with 15 (7.5%) HATs, 4 (2.0%) PVTs, and 2
(1.0%) venous outflow tract obstructions. Thrombosis was
diagnosed after a median time of 3.0 (1.0–5.5) days post￾transplantation, and at the time of diagnosis 76% of the
recipients had already started with routine antithrombotic
therapy. In recipients without antithrombotic therapy at
time of thrombosis, heparin was postponed because of
coagulation disorders with inadequate APTT levels (n ¼ 3)
or intraoperative bleeding complications with hemodynamic
instability (n ¼ 2). All 21 recipients with a thrombotic com￾plication underwent surgical reintervention, 12 recipients
eventually had to undergo a retransplantation, concerning 9
recipients with HAT, 2 with venous outflow tract obstruc￾tion, and 1 with PVT.
An increase in posttransplant thrombosis over time was
observed, with an incidence of 7.0, 9.5, and 15% in the conse￾cutive eras 2003 to 2007 (n¼ 71), 2008 to 2012 (n ¼ 63), and
2013 to 2016 (n ¼ 66), respectively. When compared with
recipients without a posttransplant thrombosis, recipients
with a thrombosis more often had metabolic liver diseases
(38 vs. 12%, p ¼ 0.003) and more often received DCD liver
grafts (14 vs. 1.1%, p¼ 0.015). In addition, patients with a
posttransplant thrombosis more often had undergone intra￾operative vascular interventions, during the transplant proce￾dure (55 vs. 16%, p< 0.001), especially concerning the hepatic
artery. These vascular interventions included surgical throm￾bectomy (n ¼ 20), or a redo or reconstruction of the arterial or
portal anastomosis (n ¼ 20) during the liver transplantation,
because of inadequate flow. Furthermore, recipients with a
posttransplant thrombosis had a longer intensive care unit
(ICU) stay (16.0 vs. 7.0 days, p¼ 0.003) and more recipients had
to undergo a reintervention (100 vs. 49%, p  0.001), compared
with those without thrombotic complications (►Table 2).
After uni- and multivariable analysis, only intraoperative
vascular interventions were identified as an independent risk
factor for posttransplant thrombosis (OR 14.45 [3.75–55.67]).
Furthermore, higher recipient age (OR 0.81 [0.69–0.95]),

higher donor age (OR 0.96 [0.93–0.99]), higher Child–Pugh
(CP) score (OR 0.81 [0.67–0.98]), and prior abdominal surgery
(OR 0.04 [0.01–0.20]) all protected against posttransplant
thrombotic complications (►Table 3).
Posttransplant Bleeding Complications
A posttransplant bleeding complication occurred in 73 (37%)
recipients, at a median time of 2.0 (1.0–4.0) days after
transplantation. In patients who received blood transfusion
or reintervention for bleeding, these decisions were based on
a combination of variables, including a low Hb value (55%),
hemodynamic instability (37%), or clinical gastrointestinal
bleeding (8%). At presentation of posttransplant bleeding,
routine antithrombotic therapy had already been started in
75% of patients. More than half of the recipients with a
bleeding complication (52%) could be stabilized with blood
transfusion, while 35 (48%) needed surgical reintervention.
During surgical reintervention, diffuse intra-abdominal
oozing from tissues was seen in 48% of patients, 26% of
patients had a bleeding from anastomosis or other vessels,
and 26% an intra-abdominal hematoma without an identifi￾able bleeding point (►Table 4).
A significant decrease in posttransplant bleeding over the
study period was observed, with an incidence of 49% in 2003
to 2007, 33% in 2008 to 2012, and 26% in 2013 to 2016
(p ¼ 0.014). Recipients with a posttransplant bleeding com￾plication had significant higher CP scores (10.0 vs. 8.0,
p ¼ 0.003), more often a medical history that included hep￾atorenal syndrome before transplantation (33 vs. 15%,
p ¼ 0.003) and longer CITs (506 vs. 441 minutes, p ¼ 0.012)
as compared with those without bleeding complications
(►Table 5). In addition, recipients with a postoperative
bleeding more often had experienced bleeding complica￾tions during transplantation (44 vs. 23%, p ¼ 0.002) with a
significantly higher intraoperative blood loss (85 vs. 62
mL/kg, p ¼ 0.040). In multivariate analysis, independent
risk factors for a postoperative bleeding complication were
a higher recipient age (OR 1.08 [1.02–1.15]), higher CP scores
(OR 1.14 [1.02–1.28]), and intraoperative blood loss in mL/kg
(OR 1.003 [1.001–1.006]; ►Table 3).

Patient and Graft Survival
Overall 1-year graft and patient survival rates were 78
and 87%, respectively. One- and 10-year graft survival in
recipients with a posttransplant thrombosis (29 and 21%)
were significantly lower when compared with recipients
without a posttransplant thrombosis (83 and 71%;
p < 0.001). One- and 10-year patient survival in recipients
with a posttransplant thrombotic complication were 71
and 64%, which was significantly lower than 88 and 83% in
recipients without a thrombotic complication (p ¼ 0.025;
►Fig. 2, ►Supplementary Fig. S1 [available in the online
version]). One- and 10-year graft survival were also
significantly lower in recipients with a bleeding compli￾cation (70 and 56%) compared with those without bleed￾ing (82 and 73%; p ¼ 0.028). This was similar for 1- and
10-year patient survival in those with bleeding compli￾cations (78 and 72%) and without bleeding complications
(91 vs. 87%; p ¼ 0.006).
In Cox regression analysis, posttransplant thrombotic and
bleeding complications were significantly associated with
mortality with a HR of 3.38 (1.36–8.45; p ¼ 0.009) and 2.50
(1.19–5.24; p ¼ 0.015), respectively, when adjusted for
potential confounders including age, weight, diagnosis, CP
score, urgency state, donor type, graft type, CIT, WIT, intra￾operative blood loss, and era.
Discussion
In this study, we report an 11% incidence of posttransplant
thrombotic complications in a cohort of 200 pediatric liver
transplant recipients, including 7.5% HAT, 2.0% PVT, and 1.0%
venous outflow tract obstruction. These incidences are rela￾tively low, as incidences of 5 to 18% for HAT and 5 to 10% for
PVT have been reported in literature.13–16 When compared
with our historical cohort, in which 20% posttransplant
thrombosis was reported, an important reduction has been
achieved in the past years.17 The introduction of routine
antithrombotic therapy might have played an important role
in this, combined with other developments in peritransplant
care. It was previously suggested that routine antithrombotic
therapy is beneficial in pediatric liver transplant recipients,
and it has been demonstrated that the combination of
heparin and acetylsalicylic acid is the most commonly
used antithrombotic therapy strategy.15,23,24
Low recipient and donor age, as well as DCD grafts and
intraoperative vascular interventions, especially when

concerning the hepatic artery, were identified risk factors for
posttransplant thrombosis in this study, which is in line with
previous studies.15,20,25 Notably, 38% of the recipients with a
posttransplant thrombotic complication had a metabolic liver
disease. Thrombosis occurred in recipients with α-1-antitryp￾sine deficiency (38%), urea cycle defects (25%), primary hyper￾oxaluria (25%), and tyrosinemia (12%), but not in those with
Wilson disease or glycogen storage diseases. Previous studies
showed comparable results, and the risk of thrombotic com￾plications in these patients have been attributed to their
hemostatic status at baseline, which in these patients is
unaltered compared with healthy children due to the absence
of liver failure.26–29
Remarkably, prior abdominal surgery appeared to protect
against postoperative thrombosis in our cohort. This might be
explained by the fact that patients with previous abdominal
surgery mainly concerned patients with biliary atresia who
underwent a Kasai procedure. At present, recipients with
biliary atresia are diagnosed early and subsequently trans￾planted in a better condition, which improved postoperative
outcomes.
Posttransplant thrombosis had a major impact on clinical
outcomes of recipients. More reinterventions and a longer ICU
stay were seen in recipients with posttransplant thrombosis,
and more importantly, both graft and patient survival were
significantly decreased. This again emphasizes the demand for
routine antithrombotic therapy in liver transplantation. On
the other hand, caution is required with routine antithrom￾botic therapy in patients with an already fragile “rebalanced
hemostatic” state, which easily can be disturbed. This is
apparent from the high proportion of posttransplant bleeding
complications, affecting 37% of the recipients.
The bleeding incidence in our study is substantially higher
when compared with 5 to 20% as reported in literature.20,21
Yet, it is difficult to compare bleeding incidences between
studies because of a large variety of definitions for bleeding
complications. Importantly, most patients with a bleeding
complication could be stabilized with a blood transfusion.
Although blood transfusions are not without risks, these
risks are fairly minor compared with the risks of thrombosis,
as is also reflected in the inferior graft and patient survival in
those with thrombosis, as shown in ►Fig. 2.
Not all posttransplant bleeding complications are related to
antithrombotic therapy. At the time of posttransplant bleed￾ings, 25% of the recipients had not received intravenous
heparin yet, due to the inadequate hemostatic state of the
recipient. Independent risk factors for posttransplant bleeding
were high recipient age, high CP scores, and intraoperative
blood loss and recipients with posttransplant bleedings more
than twice as often had a hepatorenal syndrome. Both high CP
score and hepatorenal syndrome are manifestations of more
severe, decompensated cirrhosis.8,12
An additional factor that could have played a role in the high
proportion of bleeding complications, is the potentially over￾dosing of heparin in older pediatric patients. According to our
clinical protocol, heparin is started at 10 U/kg/h and doses are
guided by APTT levels, up to a maximum of 30 U/kg/h.
Consequentially, in a 40-kg pediatric patient, doses of
1,200 U/hour could be reached, meaning 28,800 U/24 hours,
whereas a therapeutic heparin dose for adult patients is only
20,000 U/24 hours. However, as the APTT is already prolonged
prior to heparin infusion, target ranges are unclear. Important￾ly, the APTT appears to underestimate the anticoagulant effect
of heparin in adult patients with cirrhosis.30 Also, anti-Xa tests
are unreliable to assess heparin dose in patients with cirrhosis.
Therefore, it might be beneficial to explore other monitoring
modalities such as thromboelastometry, and to establish a
maximum heparin dose in pediatric patients.
Over the study period, the incidence of bleeding compli￾cations decreased. Improvements in surgical, anesthesiolog￾ical, and posttransplant ICU care as well as donor organ
quality and preservation may be an explanation for this.
Furthermore, recipient age decreased substantially over
time, and more experience with dosing of antithrombotic
therapy, combined with the introduction of coagulation tests
such as thromboelastography presumably played an impor￾tant role in this reduction.
In contrast, we observed, though not significant, anincrease
in posttransplant thrombosis over time, which may be related
to several factors. First, recipient age decreased substantially
over time. Second, the proportion of patients transplanted for
metabolic liver diseases and the proportion of DCD liver
transplantations increased in the third era.
In our study population, 76% of the recipients with post￾transplant thrombosis had actually started with antithrom￾botic therapy at time of diagnosing thrombosis, indicating
24% (n ¼ 5) had not. Would thrombotic events in these latter
recipients have been preventable? Intraoperative bleeding
seems to be an adequate reason to postpone antithrombotic
therapy. Inadequate APTT levels though, could be questioned
as reason to postpone antithrombotic therapy, since APTT
tests only measures the procoagulant pathway, which is
probably rebalanced by the anticoagulant pathway in these
patients. This again indicates the vulnerable rebalanced
hemostatic state in these patients, which can be easily
turned from a hypo- to a hypercoagulable state and vice
versa, and requires further research.
The current study has its limitations. First, this is a single￾center retrospective cohort study, which is susceptible to
confounding and selection bias. Second, to study the effects
of routine antithrombotic therapy, recipients are ideally
compared before and after its introduction. However, to
identify a significant reduction, large groups are needed
over a long period, which will lead to results confounded
by the various other developments in peritransplant man￾agement that took place over time.
In conclusion, in 200 consecutive pediatric transplants
receiving routine postoperative antithrombotic therapy, in￾cluding 1 week unfractionated heparin followed by 3 months
acetylsalicylic acid, we report a low incidence of posttrans￾plant vascular complications. Posttransplant antithrombotic
therapy seems valuable for pediatric liver transplant care.
A more personalized approach in antithrombotic therapy to
optimize the risk/benefit ratio, with a more proactive use of
antithrombotic therapy in young recipients with metabolic
liver failure, especially in case of intraoperative vascular

interventions, and a more careful approach in older recipients
with high CP scores or significant intraoperative blood loss
may have merit, but this requires clinical confirmation.
