Abstract
Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent and clinically relevant problem in critically ill patients. Various
randomized controlled trials (RCT) have attempted to assess potentially beneficial treatments for AKI. Different
approaches to applying the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria for AKI make a comparison
of studies difficult. The objective of this study was to assess how different approaches may impact estimates of AKI
incidence and whether the association between AKI and 90-day mortality varied by the approach used.
Methods: Consecutive acutely admitted adult intensive care patients were included in a prospective observational
study. AKI was determined following the KDIGO criteria during the first 7 days of ICU admission. In this post hoc
analysis, we assessed whether AKI incidence differed when applying the KDIGO criteria in 30 different possible
methods, varying in (A) serum creatinine (sCr), (B) urine output (UO), and (C) the method of combining these two
into an outcome, e.g., severe AKI. We assessed point estimates and 95% confidence intervals for each incidence.
Univariable regression was used to assess the associations between AKI and 90-day mortality.
Results: A total of 1010 patients were included. Baseline creatinine was available in 449 (44%) patients. The
incidence of any AKI ranged from 28% (95%CI 25–31%) to 75% (95%CI 72–77%) depending on the approach used.
Methods to estimate missing baseline sCr caused a variation in AKI incidence up to 15%. Different methods of
handling UO caused a variation of up to 35%. At 90 days, 263 patients (26%) had died, and all 30 variations were
associated with 90-day mortality.

Conclusions: In this cohort of critically ill patients, AKI incidence varied from 28 to 75%, depending on the method
used of applying the KDIGO criteria. A tighter adherence to KDIGO definitions is warranted to decrease the
heterogeneity of AKI and increase the comparability of future studies.

Background
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a highly complex and com￾mon syndrome associated with increased mortality. A
myriad of ways to report the incidence of AKI has been
proposed [1]. The first diagnostic criteria for AKI were
created to reduce heterogeneity in reporting AKI and
outcomes; the Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of kidney func￾tion, and End-stage kidney disease (RIFLE) classification
[2], which were slightly updated into the Acute Kidney
Injury Network (AKIN) classification [3]. The Kidney
Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria
combine these and are currently recommended to assess
AKI [4]. The KDIGO definition relies on three diagnos￾tic criteria: a rise in serum creatinine (sCr), a decrease in
urine output (UO), and administration of renal replace￾ment therapy (RRT) [4].
Despite efforts to unify the diagnosis and reporting of
AKI [5], recent literature has reported varying AKI inci￾dences and outcomes [6, 7]. Multiple ways of applying
the KDIGO criteria exist. Some limitations are inherent
to the physiological basis of the criteria themselves. For
example, using sCr has its limitations, such as a delay in
the rise after an insult, and fluctuations according to
fluid and nutritional status as well as muscle mass [8].
Moreover, a baseline sCr value is required for the com￾parison of sCr measurements during admission, which is
often lacking in acutely admitted critically ill patients [9,
10]. Various formulas to estimate baseline sCr exist,
which lead to varying AKI incidences and misclassifica￾tion of AKI [9–13]. The criteria for UO are less fre￾quently used as it is challenging to collect hourly UO
data prospectively, and electronic health record data
may be unreliable [14]. Using only the sCr criteria, how￾ever, likely underestimates AKI incidence [15–17].
Besides the limitations inherent to sCr and UO in crit￾ically ill patients, the KDIGO criteria are currently ap￾plied in different ways leading to various incidences and
outcomes, due to different interpretations but also using
modifications to KDIGO to fit the data available. For ex￾ample, the various formulas for baseline sCr and UO,
calculating the average UO per kilogram per hour using
a 6-h time interval is theoretically more sensitive for de￾tecting AKI compared to 24-h intervals [4].
AKI is a significant clinical problem and at the core of
many ongoing research efforts. Randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) investigating different aspects of AKI in the
last 5 years have used various criteria as either inclusion
or outcome definitions, and this may hamper the com￾parison of these RCTs (Additional file 1: E-Table 1. Ex￾amples of RCTs). A more standardized and therewith
uniform approach towards applying KDIGO criteria may
aid in decreasing the variety in used definitions for AKI,
to help further increase the comparability of future trials.
In this study, we aimed to investigate whether and how
different applications of methods affect AKI outcomes
depending on the options of handling (A) (baseline) sCr,
(B) UO data, and (C) reported outcomes.
Methods
The Simple Intensive Care Studies II (SICS-II) was a
single-center, prospective observational study designed
to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of re￾peated clinical examination and ultrasonography in crit￾ically ill patients (NCT03577405) [18].
Objective
The primary objective of this post hoc analysis was to
evaluate how the options for applying the KDIGO cri￾teria influence the incidence of AKI.
We evaluated different options in terms of the use of
(A) serum creatinine, (B) urine output, and (C) the
method of reporting the AKI outcomes (Fig. 1). Renal
replacement therapy (RRT) was handled similarly in
every variant, always resulting in KDIGO stage 3 for that
observation day.
Options for serum creatinine (A)
In theory, AKI can be assessed without using sCr (A1).
If serum creatinine is used, there are various methods to
estimate the sCr baseline if this is unknown. Four varia￾tions are suggested for estimating the baseline sCr. First,
without any formula, the first sCr observation is used as
a reference value if this is missing (A2) [19, 20]. Second,
while assuming a clearance of 75 mL/min/m2
, the Modi￾fication of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula (A3)
[21], the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collab￾oration (CKD-EPI) formula without age adjustment (A4)
[22], or the CKD-EPI formula with age-adjusted GFR
(A5) [12] can be used to estimate the baseline sCr if this
is missing.
Wiersema et al. Critical Care (2020) 24:164 Page 2 of 8

Options for the use of urine output (B)
UO is frequently not considered in (notably retrospect￾ive) AKI studies (B1). When UO is taken into consider￾ation, there are at least three methods to apply UO
criteria: using hourly registered data for 6-h windows
(sliding method; B2) or fixed 6-h windows (fixed
method; B3) (Additional file 1: E-figure 1), or using 24-h
cumulative UO samples divided by four (B4) to assess
the average UO for 6 h.
Options for reporting AKI outcomes (C)
Four different methods have been suggested for report￾ing the incidence of AKI. The first method is without re￾classification, so essentially reporting KDIGO AKI
stages, thus reporting the highest observed stage during
the observation period (C1) [6]. The second is a reclassi￾fication of a categorical KDIGO variable into a dichot￾omous variable where no AKI includes AKI stage 0, and
any AKI includes AKI stage 1, stage 2, or stage 3 (C2)
[23]. The third method is equal to the second method
but requests that both sCr and UO criteria (in contrast
with either sCr or UO criteria) are fulfilled (C3) [15].
The fourth method is only severe AKI, where no severe
AKI is any AKI stage 0 or 1, and severe AKI is any AKI
stage 2 or stage 3 (C4) [24]. More granular methods that
also include an aspect of time, such as persistent AKI
[25, 26], the duration of AKI [27], or AKI burden [28] (a
proportion of severity and duration based on available
data), were not included in the primary analysis but pre￾sented as supplements.
Theory versus practice
Theoretically, in total, 80 possible combinations can be
calculated from how to apply the different options
(Fig. 1). In practice, however, some options are clinically
somewhat irrelevant. For example, creatinine is nearly
always used (i.e., option A1 might be clinically irrele￾vant), some studies advise only to use available baseline
sCr (A2) and using 6-h sliding windows for UO (B2). In
this study, we therefore chose to calculate the frequently
applied methods, i.e., to use 6-h sliding windows when
testing sCr options, and to assume no baseline estima￾tion when combining with options of UO. Together, var￾iations in sCr and UO then assemble eight options.
Multiplying these eight options of variations in A and B
by four options of reporting AKI results in 32 sensible
variations. However, for C3, it is not possible to calculate
this without either sCr (A1) or UO (B1). Thus, in total,
we calculated 30 sensible variations of AKI (i.e.,
A2B2C4, indicating AKI based on sCr without baseline
Fig. 1 Different options for defining and reporting AKI outcomes. Illustration of how different theoretical options in serum creatinine (level A, five
variants) and urine output (level B, four variants) could lead to twenty different ways of assigning a KDIGO stage per observation day. Here, eight
practical combinations of A and B are shown. In total, this results in a total of 32 variations of reporting AKI, as AKI can be expressed for example
using one of the four displayed reporting outcomes. However, defining AKI on both sCr and UO cannot be done for the two practical
combinations in which either sCr or UO is used. Hence, 30 different variations were investigated. AKI, acute kidney injury; sCr, serum creatinine;

estimation, and UO based on sliding 6-h windows,
expressed as severe AKI).
Participants
All patients admitted to the ICU were screened 24/7 for
eligibility during the study period. The target population
included acutely admitted patients above 18 years of age,
with an expected ICU stay of at least 24 h. Patients were
excluded if they were previously included in this study, if
they were in strict isolation limiting patient access for
research purposes, or when informed consent was not
obtained. The local institutional review board approved
the study (M18.228393). In patients not capable of pro￾viding consent due to the acute illness, informed consent
was first obtained from the legal representatives. Con￾sent for the use of the study data was asked at a later
time whenever possible. If the patient deceased before
consent was obtained, the study data was used, and the
legal representatives were informed of the study.
Variables
We registered patient characteristics such as demo￾graphical data, comorbidities, and severity of illness
scores at admission. Comorbidity data were defined fol￾lowing the Dutch National Intensive Care Evaluation
(NICE) registry; specifically, chronic kidney disease
(CKD) was defined by serum creatinine above 177 μmol/
L [29, 30]. Patient evaluations included clinical examin￾ation and ultrasound, which were performed within 3
and 24 h of ICU admission, respectively. Measurements
were conducted by research interns and PhD students,
who were not involved in patient care. Data for AKI
diagnosis were extracted from electronic health records
(EHR). All available data on sCr, UO, and RRT were col￾lected during the first 7 days of ICU admission. Baseline
sCr was defined as the lowest value of sCr in the year
before ICU admission. We assessed whether any baseline
sCr value was available (up to 1 year prior to ICU admis￾sion) in the EHR which could be from appointments
with specialists or previous admissions. UO data were
extracted from the EHR in two ways which were separ￾ately analyzed: the fluid registry as filled in by health
care providers at the bedside which was used for options
B2 and B3; 24-h urine collection samples sent for labora￾tory analysis as part of routine daily care (option B4).
Outcomes were assessed as AKI incidence and 90-day
mortality. The 90-day mortality data were obtained from
the municipal registry. If patients emigrated within the
90-day follow-up period, they were considered lost to
follow-up.
Statistics
Continuous variables were reported as means (with
standard deviations (SD)) or medians (with interquartile
ranges (IQR)) depending on the distributions. Categor￾ical data, including AKI incidences, were presented in
proportions. We evaluated the different incidences that
resulted from the various combinations and calculated
the 95%CIs.
Associations with 90-day mortality were assessed with
univariable logistic regression analysis. The area under
the ROC curve was assessed as a measure of the per￾formance of each variant to predict mortality. P values
of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Ana￾lyses were performed using Stata version 15 (StataCorp,
College Station, TX, USA) and R version 3.5.1.
Sensitivity analyses
We performed two sensitivity analyses. First, we re￾peated our analysis after excluding patients with CKD to
assess whether this would change our results. Second,
we repeated our analysis after excluding patients with
unknown baseline sCr.
Results
Between May 14, 2018, and July 10, 2019, a total of 3357
patients were assessed for eligibility, of whom 1104 ful￾filled the inclusion criteria. Data were not obtained for
94 patients; as 45 patients died before inclusion, con￾tinuous resuscitation efforts were made in 26 patients
and for other logistic reasons in 23 patients. In total,
1010 patients (91% of 1104) were included in the SICS￾II cohort (Table 1, Additional file 1: E-Figure 2).
Data availability
In 449 patients (44%), the sCr baseline was registered,
and for the other 561 patients, the sCr baseline was esti￾mated using the various options (Additional file 1: E￾Table 4). Among patients with estimated baseline sCr,
the median first sCr was 90 (IQR 69–122) μmol/L. The
median observation period was 2 days (IQR 1–5). Of the
1010 patients, 658 patients (65%) were discharged to the
ward, and 135 patients (13%) died during the first 7 days
of ICU admission. Eighty-eight patients (9%) had CKD.
Altogether, 34 patients (3%) were treated with dialysis
before admission, and in 25 of them, a baseline Cr was
known. In 1008 patients (99%), one or more sCr mea￾surements were available during the first 7 days of ICU
admission. RRT was instigated in 61 patients (6%) during
the first 7 days of ICU admission. One or more 24-h
urine collection period samples were available for 728
patients (72%). UO data in hourly samples were available
for 989 patients (98%); the median number of hours
available was 47 h (IQR 22–120), with the median per￾centage of hours available out of ICU stay hours being
91% (76–96%). In 15 patients (1.5%), no data on UO
were available. Missing data per calendar day are shown
in Additional file 1: E-Table 5.

Acute kidney injury
Overall, AKI incidence ranged from 28% (95%CI 25–31%)
to 75% (95%CI 72–77%) when applying the 30 different
approaches to AKI (Fig. 2, Additional file 1: E-Table 2). In￾cidence was highest when using the age-adjusted CKD￾EPI formula to estimate the baseline sCr and sliding 6-h
UO windows. Incidences were lowest when using only
available baseline sCr and no estimation formula, com￾bined with 24-h cumulative UO values or without using
UO at all. Different sCr options caused a variation of up
to 15%. Different UO approaches caused a variation of up
to 35%. More granular methods, like AKI burden simi￾larly, varied (Additional file 1: E-Table 3).
Ninety-day mortality
Eleven patients (1%) were lost to follow-up due to mi￾gration. At the 90-day follow-up, 263 patients (26%) had
died (Table 1). Most applied criteria for AKI were
associated with 90-day mortality (Additional file 1: E￾Table 6). Of all different criteria, using no baseline
creatinine estimation combined with 24-h cumulative
UO data seemed to have the strongest univariable
association with 90-day mortality for AKI burden and
using no UO data at all for persistent AKI (Add￾itional file 1: E-Table 7).
Sensitivity analyses
Variation of incidences was similar when excluding patients
with CKD (Additional file 1: E-Fig. 3). Variation in AKI in￾cidence was 26% when including only patients in whom
baseline sCr was known (Additional file 1: E-Fig. 4).
Discussion
In this post hoc study using data from a prospective ob￾servational study on AKI in acutely admitted critically ill
patients, we showed that AKI incidence varied depend￾ing on the method used to apply KDIGO criteria. Our
results may partly explain the high variability in AKI in￾cidence in the literature and provide an opportunity to
increase the comparability for future observational stud￾ies and RCTs focusing on AKI.
Previous studies have assessed the differences between
previous versions of AKI definitions such as the RIFLE
criteria and demonstrated that these differences led to
varying associations between AKI and outcomes [31,
32]. The initiative to define AKI uniformly was based on
the need to be able to compare research results. Still,
based on our hypothesis, up to 80 different methods can
be used to assess AKI using the current KDIGO defin￾ition. Methods varied based on baseline sCr handling,
UO data handling, how AKI is defined (any AKI, severe
AKI, etc.), and whether both UO and sCr should be ful￾filled or either [33], as it is recommended they are to be
used independently for diagnosis and staging. In conclu￾sion, without one uniform approach to KDIGO criteria,
comparison of study outcomes or systematic reviews of
previous AKI studies is complicated.
The impact on the incidence of AKI using different
methods to enter baseline sCr has been widely recognized
[20, 34]. The absence of a sCr baseline and differences in
methods handling the missing data should be standard￾ized, as back estimations seem insufficient [12], and in a
sensitivity analysis, we showed that variation of AKI inci￾dence decreased if baseline sCr was known and thus no
estimation was needed. Overall, it seems from our results
that using only available baseline sCr and no estimation
results for sCr leads to the strongest association with mor￾tality. One possible explanation for this finding could be
that the patients with a measured sCr baseline have a rea￾son to be hospitalized or even had renal failure. However,
we deem this explanation unlikely, as the observed sCr
values are within normal ranges.

Even though most recent studies have used the
complete KDIGO criteria, many studies discard or change
the UO criteria, despite that adding UO significantly in￾creases AKI incidence [15–17]. Obtaining UO data may be
challenging, as optimally hourly UO is recorded. Registra￾tion may be inaccurate, and missed observations can mis￾takenly be registered as anuria with implications for AKI
diagnosis. Additionally, the KDIGO does not take ideal
body weight into account, and often, only weight at admis￾sion or an estimation is used, influencing AKI diagnosis
[35, 36]. Notably, the incidence of AKI was higher when
using a sliding window for 6-h periods, indicating that each
hour could mean that the average UO of the previous 6 h
adjusts to below 0.5 mL/kg/h, logically increasing AKI inci￾dence. Further investigation regarding the use of sliding 6-h
UO as AKI criterion is needed, elucidating whether the 6-h
UO should be measured consecutively or averaged to deter￾mine whether a patient has oliguria.
Some of the approaches illustrated in this manuscript
are a result of a difference in interpretation of the
KDIGO criteria, while others are intended modifications
applied to fit certain studies or to assess its prognostic
values. Nonetheless, all the various methods that are
currently used to express AKI were likely adapted to bet￾ter appreciate AKI heterogeneity. However, the resulting
variation in research complicates the generalizability of
results and may profoundly bias some conclusions.
Strengths and limitations
Some strengths of this study exist. First, it was per￾formed following a pre-published protocol, and almost
all eligible patients were included. Second, instead of
choosing one method to define AKI to answer the ori￾ginal research questions, we chose to perform a post hoc
analysis to evaluate the variability in results. Some ap￾parent limitations need to be considered. First, as our
data were to some extent incomplete, we, thus, only per￾formed a complete case analysis for the different defini￾tions of AKI. Therefore, not all 30 approaches could be
compared in the entire population. Second, some data
were lacking throughout the seven observation days, as
patients could have been discharged to the ward or de￾ceased during this period, and if less than 24-h data were
available, no KDIGO stage 3 could be diagnosed based
on UO. However, the amount of missing data while pa￾tients were still in the ICU was low, and patients with an
expected stay below 24 h were excluded. Third, we in￾cluded an all-comers population of critically ill patients,
and therefore, studying subgroups, such as patients with
sepsis, could have further explicated our results. However,
we consider including a heterogeneous group of patients
as appropriate to illustrate the existence and magnitude of
the problem. Fourth, this was a single-center study, and
the lack of external validation is an important limitation.
Last, our outcome was 90-day mortality, and we did not

assess the development of organ dysfunction, administra￾tion of RRT, or any patient-reported outcomes. These out￾comes could, combined with a longer follow-up, potentially
aid in identifying clinically relevant phenotypes of AKI.
Conclusion
In this cohort of critically ill patients, AKI incidence var￾ied from 28 to 75%, depending on the method used to
apply the same KDIGO definition. Availability of base￾line sCr decreased incidence variation. A more uniform
application of the KDIGO definitions for AKI could
decrease the variety of AKI incidences and increase the
comparability of future studies.
