Abstract
Introduction: Evidence-based recommendations are needed to guide the acute management of the bleeding
trauma patient. When these recommendations are implemented patient outcomes may be improved.
Methods: The multidisciplinary Task Force for Advanced Bleeding Care in Trauma was formed in 2005 with the
aim of developing a guideline for the management of bleeding following severe injury. This document represents
an updated version of the guideline published by the group in 2007 and updated in 2010. Recommendations
were formulated using a nominal group process, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and
Evaluation (GRADE) hierarchy of evidence and based on a systematic review of published literature.
Results: Key changes encompassed in this version of the guideline include new recommendations on the
appropriate use of vasopressors and inotropic agents, and reflect an awareness of the growing number of patients
in the population at large treated with antiplatelet agents and/or oral anticoagulants. The current guideline also
includes recommendations and a discussion of thromboprophylactic strategies for all patients following traumatic
injury. The most significant addition is a new section that discusses the need for every institution to develop,
implement and adhere to an evidence-based clinical protocol to manage traumatically injured patients. The
remaining recommendations have been re-evaluated and graded based on literature published since the last
edition of the guideline. Consideration was also given to changes in clinical practice that have taken place during
this time period as a result of both new evidence and changes in the general availability of relevant agents and
technologies.
Conclusions: A comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to trauma care and mechanisms with which to ensure
that established protocols are consistently implemented will ensure a uniform and high standard of care across
Europe and beyond.
Introduction
Severe trauma is one of the major health care issues
faced by modern society, resulting in the annual death
of more than five million people worldwide, and this
number is expected to increase to more than eight mil￾lion by 2020 [1]. Uncontrolled post-traumatic bleeding
is the leading cause of potentially preventable death
among these patients [2,3]. Appropriate management of
the massively bleeding trauma patient includes the early
identification of bleeding sources followed by prompt
measures to minimise blood loss, restore tissue perfu￾sion and achieve haemodynamic stability.
An awareness of the specific pathophysiology asso￾ciated with bleeding following traumatic injury by treat￾ing physicians is essential. About one-third of all
bleeding trauma patients present with a coagulopathy
upon hospital admission [4-7]. This subset of patients
has a significantly increased incidence of multiple organ

failure and death compared to patients with similar
injury patterns in the absence of a coagulopathy
[4,5,7,8]. The early acute coagulopathy associated with
traumatic injury has recently been recognised as a mul￾tifactorial primary condition that results from a
combination of bleeding-induced shock, tissue injury￾related thrombin-thrombomodulin-complex generation
and the activation of anticoagulant and fibrinolytic path￾ways (Figure 1) [5-7,9-11]. Moreover, it has been shown
that high circulating levels of syndecan-1, a marker of

endothelial glycocalyx degradation, is associated with
coagulopathy in trauma patients [12]. Different factors
influence the severity of the coagulation disorder. On
one hand, coagulopathy is influenced by environmental
and therapeutic factors that result in or at least contri￾bute to acidaemia, hypothermia, dilution, hypoperfusion
and coagulation factor consumption [5,6,9,13-15]. On
the other hand, this condition is modified by individual
patient-related factors, including genetic background,
co-morbidities, inflammation and medications, especially
oral anticoagulants, and pre-hospital fluid administration
[15-17]. A recent paper suggests that the severity of
traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents a further indivi￾dual patient-related factor that may contribute to acute
traumatic coagulopathy [18]. A number of terms have
been proposed to describe the condition, which is dis￾tinct from disseminated intravascular coagulation,
including Acute Traumatic Coagulopathy [6,19], Early
Coagulopathy of Trauma [7], Acute Coagulopathy of
Trauma-Shock [9], Trauma-Induced Coagulopathy [20]
and Trauma-Associated Coagulopathy [21].
This European guideline, originally published in 2007
[22] and updated in 2010 [23], represents a second
update and is part of the European “STOP the Bleeding
Campaign“, an international initiative launched in 2013
to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with bleed￾ing following traumatic injury. The campaign aims to
support haemostatic resuscitation measures by providing
clinical practice guidelines to ensure the early recogni￾tion and treatment of bleeding and traumatic coagulopa￾thy. The acronym STOP stands for Search for patients
at risk of coagulopathic bleeding, Treat bleeding and
coagulopathy as soon as they develop, Observe the
response to interventions and Prevent secondary bleed￾ing and coagulopathy. As part of the campaign, this
guideline should not only provide a better understand￾ing of the pathophysiology of the severely bleeding
patient following traumatic injury and treatment gui￾dance for the clinician, but also highlight the areas in
which further research is urgently required. The recom￾mendations for in-hospital patient management have
been adapted to reflect the evidence published during
the last three years, a consideration of changes in clini￾cal practice that have taken place during this period as
well as new recommendations that reflect emerging
areas of clinical relevance. Although the recommenda￾tions outline corridors for diagnosis and treatment, the
author group believes that the greatest outcome
improvement can currently be made through education
and process adaptation. Therefore, our multidisciplinary
group of European experts, including designated repre￾sentatives from relevant professional societies, felt the
need to define clinically relevant “bundles” for diagnosis
and therapy, in order to facilitate the adaptation of the
guiding principles to the local situation and implemen￾tation within each institution. We believe that adherence
to the local management protocol should be assessed,
and that such regular compliance assessments should be
part of institutional quality management processes, and
that personnel training to ensure compliance should be
adapted accordingly. If followed, these clinical practice
guidelines have the potential to ensure a uniform stan￾dard of care across Europe and beyond.
Materials and methods
These recommendations were formulated and graded
according to the Grading of Recommendations Assess￾ment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) hierarchy
of evidence [24-26] summarised in Table 1. Comprehen￾sive computer database literature searches were per￾formed using the indexed online database MEDLINE/
PubMed. Lists of cited literature within relevant articles
were also screened. The primary intention of the review
was to identify prospective randomised controlled trials
(RCTs) and non-RCTs, existing systematic reviews and
guidelines. In the absence of such evidence, case-control
studies, observational studies and case reports were
considered.
Boolean operators and Medical Subject Heading
(MeSH) thesaurus keywords were applied as a standar￾dised use of language to unify differences in terminology
into single concepts. Appropriate MeSH headings and
subheadings for each question were selected and modi￾fied based on search results. The scientific questions
posed that led to each recommendation and the MeSH
headings applied to each search are listed in Additional
file 1. Searches were limited to English-language abstracts
and human studies; gender and age were not limited. The
time period was limited to the past three years for ques￾tions addressed in the 2010 version of the guideline. A
time period limit of 10 years was applied to new searches
yielding more than 500 hits; otherwise no time-period lim￾its were imposed. Abstracts from original publications
were screened for relevance and full publications evaluated
where appropriate. Some additional citations that were
published after the literature search cut-off for the guide￾line document are listed in Additional file 2; these publica￾tions were not selected according to a comprehensive
search strategy, but represent work with sufficient rele￾vance to the guideline that inclusion was requested by one
or more of the endorsing professional societies as part of
the guideline review and endorsement process.
Selection of the scientific enquiries to be addressed in
the guideline, screening and grading of the literature to
be included and formulation of specific recommenda￾tions were performed by members of the Task Force for
Advanced Bleeding Care in Trauma, a multidisciplinary,
pan-European group of experts with specialties in

surgery, anaesthesia, emergency medicine, intensive care
medicine and haematology. The core group was formed
in 2004 to produce educational material on the care of
the bleeding trauma patient on which an update (2006)
and subsequent review article [27] were based. The task
force consisted of the core group, additional experts in
haematology and guideline development, and representa￾tives of relevant European professional societies, includ￾ing the European Society of Anaesthesiology, the
European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, the Eur￾opean Shock Society, the European Society of Trauma
and Emergency Surgery and the European Society for
Emergency Medicine. The European Hematology Asso￾ciation declined the invitation to designate a representa￾tive to join the task force. As part of the guideline
development process that led to the 2007 guideline [22],
task force members participated in a workshop on the
critical appraisal of medical literature. An updated
version of the guideline was published in 2010 [23].
The nominal group process for the current update of
the guideline included several remote (telephone and
web-based) meetings and one face-to-face meeting sup￾plemented by electronic communication. The guideline
development group participated in a web conference in
January 2012 to define the scientific questions to be
addressed in the guideline. Selection, screening and grad￾ing of the literature and formulation of recommendations
were accomplished in subcommittee groups consisting of
two to five members via electronic or telephone commu￾nication. After distribution of the recommendations to
the entire group, a face-to-face meeting of the task force
was held in April 2012 with the aim of reaching a con￾sensus on the draft recommendations from each subcom￾mittee. After final refinement of the rationale for each
recommendation and the complete manuscript, the
updated document was approved by the endorsing orga￾nisations between September 2012 and January 2013. An
updated version of the guideline is anticipated in due
time.
In the GRADE system for assessing each recommen￾dation, the letter attached to the grade of recommenda￾tion reflects the degree of literature support for the
recommendation, whereas the number indicates the
level of support for the recommendation assigned by the
committee of experts. Recommendations are grouped by
category and somewhat chronologically in the treatment
decision-making process, but not by priority or
hierarchy.

Results
I. Initial resuscitation and prevention of further bleeding
Minimal elapsed time
Recommendation 1 We recommend that the time
elapsed between injury and operation be minimised
for patients in need of urgent surgical bleeding
control. (Grade 1A)
Rationale
Trauma patients in need of emergency surgery for ongoing
hemorrhage have increased survival if the elapsed time
between the traumatic injury and admission to the operat￾ing theatre is minimised. More than 50% of all trauma
patients with a fatal outcome die within 24 h of injury [3].
Despite a lack of evidence from prospective RCTs, well￾designed retrospective studies provide evidence for early
surgical intervention in patients with traumatic haemor￾rhagic shock [28-30]. In addition, studies that analyse
trauma systems indirectly emphasise the importance of
minimising the time between admission and surgical
bleeding control in patients with traumatic haemorrhagic
shock [31,32]. At present, the evidence base for the impact
of the implementation of the Advanced Trauma Life Sup￾port (ATLS) protocol on patient outcome is very poor,
because the available literature focuses primarily on the
effectiveness of ATLS as an educational tool [33]. Future
studies are needed to define the impact of the ATLS pro￾gramme within trauma systems at the hospital and health
system level in terms of controlled before-and-after imple￾mentation designed to assess post-injury mortality as the
primary outcome parameter.
Tourniquet use
Recommendation 2 We recommend adjunct tourniquet
use to stop life-threatening bleeding from open extre￾mity injuries in the pre-surgical setting. (Grade 1B)
Rationale
When uncontrolled arterial bleeding occurs from
mangled extremity injuries, including penetrating or
blast injuries or traumatic amputations, a tourniquet
represents a simple and efficient method with which to
acutely control hemorrhage [34-38]. Tourniquet applica￾tion has become standard of care for the control of
severe hemorrhage following military combat injuries,
and several publications report the effectiveness of tour￾niquets in this specific setting [34-37,39]. A study of
volunteers showed that any tourniquet device presently
on the market works efficiently [38]. The study also
showed that ‘pressure point control’ was ineffective
because collateral circulation was observed within sec￾onds. Tourniquet-induced pain was not an important
consideration. Tourniquets should be left in place until
surgical control of bleeding is achieved [35,37]; however,
this time span should be kept as short as possible.
Improper or prolonged placement of a tourniquet can
lead to complications, such as nerve paralysis and limb
ischemia [40]; however, these effects are rare [39]. Some
publications suggest a maximum time of application of
two hours [40]. Reports from military settings report
cases in which tourniquets have remained in place for
up to six hours with survival of the extremity [35].
Much discussion has been generated recently regarding
the translation of this evidence to civilian practice as
there is no published evidence. Bleeding from most civi￾lian wounds can be controlled by local pressure; how￾ever, there are case reports of effective bleeding control
by the use of a tourniquet in civilian mangled extremity
injury.
Ventilation
Recommendation 3 We recommend initial normo￾ventilation of trauma patients if there are no signs of
imminent cerebral herniation. (Grade 1C)
Rationale
Ventilation can affect the outcome of severe trauma
patients. There is a tendency for rescue personnel to
hyperventilate patients during resuscitation [41,42], and
hyperventilated trauma patients appear to have
increased mortality when compared with non-hyperven￾tilated patients [42]. For the purpose of this discussion,
the target arterial PaCO2 should be 5.0 to 5.5 kPa.
A high percentage of severely injured patients with
ongoing bleeding have TBI. Relevant experimental and
clinical data have shown that routine hyperventilation is
an important contributor to adverse outcomes in head￾injured patients; however, the effect of hyperventilation
on outcome in patients with severe trauma but no TBI
is still a matter of debate. A low PaCO2 on admission to
the emergency room is associated with a worse outcome
in trauma patients with TBI [43-46].
There are several potential mechanisms for the adverse
effects of hyperventilation and hypocapnia, including
increased vasoconstriction with decreased cerebral blood
flow and impaired tissue perfusion. In the setting of abso￾lute or relative hypovolaemia, an excessive rate of posi￾tive-pressure ventilation may further compromise venous
return and produce hypotension and even cardiovascular
collapse [44,45]. It has also been shown that cerebral tis￾sue lactic acidosis occurs almost immediately after induc￾tion of hypocapnia in children and adults with TBI and
haemorrhagic shock [47]. In addition, an even modest
level of hypocapnia (<27 mmHg) may result in neuronal
depolarisation with glutamate release and extension of
the primary injury via apoptosis [48].
Ventilation with low tidal volume (<6 ml/kg) is recom￾mended in patients with acute lung injury. In patients
with normal lung function, the evidence is scarce, but
some observational studies show that the use of a large
tidal volume is an important risk factor for the develop￾ment of lung injury [49,50]. The injurious effect of high
tidal volume may be initiated very early. Randomised
Spahn et al. Critical Care 2013, 17:R76
http://ccforum.com/content/17/2/R76

studies demonstrate that short-term ventilation (<5 h)
with high tidal volume (12 ml/kg) without positive end￾expiratory pressure (PEEP) may promote pulmonary
inflammation and alveolar coagulation in patients with
normal lung function [51]. Although more studies are
needed, the early use of protective ventilation with low
tidal volume and moderate PEEP is recommended, parti￾cularly in bleeding trauma patients at risk of acute lung
injury.
II. Diagnosis and monitoring of bleeding
Initial assessment
Recommendation 4 We recommend that the physician
clinically assess the extent of traumatic hemorrhage
using a combination of patient physiology, anatomical
injury pattern, mechanism of injury and the patient’s
response to initial resuscitation. (Grade 1C)
Rationale
Visual estimation of the amount of blood loss at the
scene of trauma can provide important information, but
may be highly influenced by physiologic parameters sug￾gesting normo or hypovolaemia [52]. The mechanism of
injury represents an important screening tool with
which to identify patients at risk for significant trau￾matic hemorrhage. For example, the American College
of Surgeons defined a threshold of 6 m (20 ft) as a “cri￾tical falling height” associated with major injuries [53].
Further critical mechanisms include blunt versus pene￾trating trauma, high energy deceleration impact, low
velocity versus high velocity gunshot injuries and so on.
The mechanism of injury in conjunction with injury
severity, as defined by trauma scoring systems, and the
patient’s physiological presentation and response to
resuscitation should further guide the decision to initiate
early surgical bleeding control as outlined in the ATLS
protocol [54-57]. Table 2 summarises estimated blood
loss based on initial presentation according to the ATLS
classification system. Although the ATLS classification is
a useful guide in haemorrhagic shock, a recent retro￾spective analysis of the validity of this classification sys￾tem showed that increasing blood loss produces an
increase in heart rate and decrease in blood pressure,
but to a lesser degree than suggested by the ATLS clas￾sification. In addition, there are no significant changes
in respiratory rate or in conscience level with bleeding
[58]. Table 3 characterises the three types of response to
initial fluid resuscitation, whereby the transient respon￾ders and the non-responders are candidates for immedi￾ate surgical bleeding control.
Specific scores to predict the risk of haemorrhagic
shock may be useful to provide a prompt and appropri￾ate treatment; however, its usefulness is still not optimal.
Paladino et al. [59] analyzed the usefulness of the Shock
Index (heart rate divided by systolic blood pressure) and
found that this index may be useful in drawing attention
to abnormal values, but that it is too insensitive to rule
out disease and should not lower the suspicion of major
injury. The TASH score (Trauma Associated Severe
Hemorrhage) uses seven parameters (systolic blood
pressure, haemoglobin (Hb), intra-abdominal fluid, com￾plex long bone and/or pelvic fractures, heart rate, base
excess and gender) to predict the probability of mass
transfusion. Maegele et al. [60] retrospectively analysed
a dataset of severely multiply-injured patients from the
German Trauma Registry to confirm the validity of the
TASH score to predict the individual probability of mas￾sive transfusion and, therefore, ongoing life-threatening
hemorrhage. The TASH score has recently been re-vali￾dated with 5,834 patients from the same registry [61].
Immediate intervention
Recommendation 5 We recommend that patients
presenting with haemorrhagic shock and an identi￾fied source of bleeding undergo an immediate bleed￾ing control procedure unless initial resuscitation
measures are successful. (Grade 1B)
Rationale
The source of bleeding may be immediately obvious,
and penetrating injuries are more likely to require surgi￾cal bleeding control. In a retrospective study of 106
abdominal vascular injuries, all 41 patients arriving in
shock following gunshot wounds were candidates for
rapid transfer to the operating theatre for surgical bleed￾ing control [62]. A similar observation in a study of 271
patients undergoing immediate laparotomy for gunshot
wounds indicates that these wounds combined with
signs of severe hypovolaemic shock specifically require
early surgical bleeding control. This observation is true
to a lesser extent for abdominal stab wounds [63]. Data
on injuries caused by penetrating metal fragments from
explosives or gunshot wounds in the Vietnam War con￾firm the need for early surgical control when patients
present in shock [64]. In blunt trauma, the mechanism
of injury can to a certain extent determine whether the
patient in haemorrhagic shock will be a candidate for
surgical bleeding control. Only a few studies address the
relationship between the mechanism of injury and the
risk of bleeding, however, and none of these publica￾tions is a randomised prospective trial of high evidence
[65]. We have found no objective data describing the
relationship between the risk of bleeding and the
mechanism of injury resulting in skeletal fractures in
general or of long-bone fractures in particular.
Traffic accidents are the leading cause of pelvic injury.
Motor vehicle crashes cause approximately 60% of pelvic
fractures followed by falls from great height (23%). Most
of the remainder result from motorbike collisions and
vehicle-pedestrian accidents [66,67]. There is a correla￾tion between ‘unstable’ pelvic fractures and intra￾Spahn et al. Critical Care 2013, 17:R76
http://ccforum.com/content/17/2/R76
Page 6 of 45

abdominal injuries [66,68]. An association between
major pelvic fractures and severe head injuries, conco￾mitant thoracic, abdominal, urological and skeletal inju￾ries is also well described [66]. High-energy injuries
produce greater damage to both the pelvis and organs.
Patients with high-energy injuries require more transfu￾sion units, and more than 75% have associated head,
thorax, abdominal or genitourinary injuries [69]. It is
well documented that ‘unstable’ pelvic fractures are
associated with massive hemorrhage [68,70], and hemor￾rhage is the leading cause of death in patients with
major pelvic fractures. Vertical shear pelvic ring frac￾tures with caudal displacement of the hemipelvis may
disrupt the pelvic floor and pelvic vasculature far more
than standard vertical shear injuries. Inferior displace￾ment of the hemipelvis using X-ray imaging should,
therefore, alert the surgeon to the possible presence of
severe arterial injuries [71].
Further investigation
Recommendation 6 We recommend that patients
presenting with haemorrhagic shock and an uniden￾tified source of bleeding undergo immediate further
investigation. (Grade 1B)
Rationale
A patient in haemorrhagic shock with an unidentified
source of bleeding should undergo immediate further
assessment of chest, abdominal cavity and pelvic ring,
which represent the major sources of acute blood loss
in trauma. Aside from a clinical examination, X-rays of
chest and pelvis in conjunction with ultrasonography
[72] or occasionally diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL)
[73] are recommended diagnostic modalities during the
primary survey [57,74,75]. In selected centres, readily
available computed tomography (CT) scanners [76] may
replace conventional radiographic imaging techniques
during the primary survey. In their systematic literature
review, Jorgensen and colleagues found no evidence that
pre-hospital ultrasound of the abdomen or chest
improves the treatment of trauma patients [77].
Imaging
Recommendation 7 We recommend early imaging
(ultrasonography or CT) for the detection of free fluid
in patients with suspected torso trauma. (Grade 1B)
Intervention
Recommendation 8 We recommend that patients
with significant free intra-abdominal fluid and hae￾modynamic instability undergo urgent intervention.
(Grade 1A)
Further assessment
Recommendation 9 We recommend further assess￾ment using CT for haemodynamically stable patients.

Rationale
Blunt abdominal trauma represents a major diagnostic
challenge and an important source of internal bleeding.
Ultrasonography has been established as a rapid and
non-invasive diagnostic approach for detection of intra￾abdominal free fluid in the emergency room [78-80].
Large prospective observational studies determined a
high specificity and accuracy but low sensitivity of initial
ultrasonographic examination for detecting intra￾abdominal injuries in adults and children [81-87]. Liu
and colleagues [88] found a high sensitivity, specificity
and accuracy of initial ultrasound examination for the
detection of haemoperitoneum. Ultrasonography has a
high specificity but a low sensitivity for detecting free
intra-peritoneal fluid in penetrating torso trauma [89] and
in blunt abdominal trauma in children [90]. A positive
ultrasound suggests haemoperitoneum, but a negative
initial abdominal ultrasound should direct further diagnos￾tic investigations. Although CT scan and DPL were shown
to be more sensitive than sonography for detection of hae￾moperitoneum, these diagnostic modalities are more time￾consuming (CT and DPL) and invasive (DPL) [88].
The role of CT-scanning in acute trauma patients is
well documented [91-98], and in recent years imaging
for trauma patients has migrated towards multi-slice
computed tomography (MSCT). The integration of
modern MSCT scanners in the emergency room area
allows the immediate assessment of trauma victims fol￾lowing admission [93,94]. Using modern MSCT scan￾ners, total whole-body scanning time may be reduced to
less than 30 seconds. In a retrospective study comparing
370 patients in two groups, Weninger and colleagues
[94] showed that faster diagnosis using MSCT led to
shorter emergency room and operating room time and
shorter intensive care unit (ICU) stays [94]. Huber￾Wagner et al. [76] also showed the benefit of integration
of the whole-body CT into early trauma care. CT diag￾nosis significantly increases the probability of survival in
patients with polytrauma. Whole-body CT as a standard
diagnostic tool during the earliest resuscitation phase
for polytraumatised patients provides the added benefit
of identifying head and chest injuries and other bleeding
sources in multiply injured patients.
Some authors have shown the benefit of contrast med￾ium-enhanced CT scanning. Anderson et al. [99,100]
found high accuracy in the evaluation of splenic injuries
resulting from trauma after administration of IV contrast
material. Delayed-phase CT may be used to detect active
bleeding in solid organs. Fang et al. [101] demonstrated
that the pooling of contrast material within the peritoneal
cavity in blunt liver injuries indicates active and massive
bleeding. Patients with this finding showed rapid dete￾rioration of haemodynamic status, and most of them
required emergent surgery. Intra-parenchymal pooling of
contrast material with an unruptured liver capsule often
indicates a self-limited hemorrhage, and these patients
respond well to non-operative treatment. Tan and collea￾gues [102] found that patients with hollow viscus and
mesenteric injuries following blunt abdominal trauma
exhibited an abnormal preoperative CT scan. Wu et al.
[103] showed the accuracy of CT in identifying severe,
life-threatening mesenteric hemorrhage and blunt bowel
injuries.
Compared to MSCT, all traditional techniques for
diagnostic and imaging evaluation are associated with
some limitations. The diagnostic accuracy, safety and
effectiveness of immediate MSCT are dependent on
sophisticated pre-hospital treatment by trained and
experienced emergency personnel and short transporta￾tion times [104,105]. If an MSCT is not available in the
emergency room, the realisation of CT scanning implies
transportation of the patient to the CT room; therefore,
the clinician must evaluate the implications and poten￾tial risks and benefits of the procedure. During trans￾port, all vital signs should be closely monitored and
resuscitation measures continued. For those patients in
whom haemodynamic stability is questionable, imaging
techniques, such as ultrasound and chest and pelvic
radiography, may be useful. Peritoneal lavage is rarely
indicated if ultrasound or CT is available [106]. Transfer
times to and from all forms of diagnostic imaging need
to be considered carefully in any patient who is haemo￾dynamically unstable. In addition to the initial clinical
assessment, near-patient testing results, including full
blood count, haematocrit (Hct), blood gases and lactate,
should be readily available under ideal circumstances.
The hypotensive patient (systolic blood pressure below
90 mmHg) presenting free intra-abdominal fluid accord￾ing to ultrasonography or CT is a potential candidate
for early surgery if he or she cannot be stabilised by
initiated fluid resuscitation [107-109]. A retrospective
study by Rozycki and colleagues [110] of 1,540 patients
(1,227 with blunt, 313 with penetrating trauma) assessed
with ultrasound as an early diagnostic tool showed that
the ultrasound examination had a sensitivity and specifi￾city close to 100% when patients were hypotensive.
A number of patients who present with free intra￾abdominal fluid according to ultrasound can safely
undergo further investigation with MSCT. Under nor￾mal circumstances, adult patients need to be haemody￾namically stable when MSCT is performed outside of
the emergency room [110]. Haemodynamically stable
patients with a high risk mechanism of injury, such as
high-energy trauma or even low-energy injuries in the
older population, should be scanned after ultrasound for
additional injuries using MSCT. As CT scanners are
integrated in resuscitation units, whole-body CT diagno￾sis may replace ultrasound as a diagnostic method.

Haematocrit
Recommendation 10 We do not recommend the use
of single Hct measurements as an isolated laboratory
marker for bleeding. (Grade 1B)
Rationale
Hct assays are part of the basic diagnostic work-up for
trauma patients. The diagnostic value of the Hct for
detecting trauma patients with severe injury and occult
bleeding sources has been a topic of debate in the past
decade [111-113]. A major limit of the Hct’s diagnostic
value is the confounding influence of resuscitative mea￾sures on the Hct due to administration of intravenous
fluids and red cell concentrates [114-116]. In addition,
initial Hct does not accurately reflect blood loss because
patients bleed whole blood and compensatory mechan￾isms that move fluids from interstitial space require
time and are not reflected in initial Hct measurements.
A retrospective study of 524 trauma patients determined
a low sensitivity (0.5) of the initial Hct on admission for
detecting those patients with traumatic hemorrhage
requiring surgical intervention [113]. The concept of the
low sensitivity of initial Hct for the detection of severe
bleeding has recently been challenged. In a retrospective
study of 196 trauma patients, Ryan et al. [117] found
that Hct at admission closely correlates with haemorrha￾gic shock. However, this study included severe cases
requiring emergency surgery only (most with penetrat￾ing injuries), and may not be applicable to the general
trauma patient population. Two prospective observa￾tional diagnostic studies determined the sensitivity of
serial Hct measurements for detecting patients with
severe injury [111,112]. Decreasing serial Hct measure￾ments may reflect continued bleeding; however, the
patient with significant bleeding may maintain his or
her serial Hct.
Serum lactate and base deficit
Recommendation 11 We recommend either serum
lactate or base deficit measurements as sensitive
tests to estimate and monitor the extent of bleeding
and shock. (Grade 1B)
Rationale
Serum lactate has been used as a diagnostic parameter
and prognostic marker of haemorrhagic shock since the
1960s [118]. The amount of lactate produced by anaero￾bic glycolysis is an indirect marker of oxygen debt, tis￾sue hypoperfusion and the severity of haemorrhagic
shock [119-122]. Similarly, base deficit values derived
from arterial blood gas analysis provide an indirect esti￾mation of global tissue acidosis due to impaired perfu￾sion [119,121]. Vincent and colleagues [123] showed the
value of serial lactate measurements for predicting survi￾val in a prospective study in patients with circulatory
shock. This study showed that changes in lactate con￾centrations provide an early and objective evaluation of
a patient’s response to therapy and suggested that
repeated lactate determinations represent a reliable
prognostic index for patients with circulatory shock
[123]. Abramson and colleagues [124] performed a pro￾spective observational study in patients with multiple
trauma to evaluate the correlation between lactate clear￾ance and survival. All patients in whom lactate levels
returned to the normal range (≤2 mmol/l) within 24 h
survived. Survival decreased to 77.8% if normalisation
occurred within 48 h and to 13.6% in those patients in
whom lactate levels were elevated above 2 mmol/l for
more than 48 h [124]. These findings were confirmed in
a study by Manikis and colleagues [125], who showed
that the initial lactate levels were higher in non-survi￾vors after major trauma, and that the prolonged time
for normalisation of lactate levels of more than 24 h
was associated with the development of post-traumatic
organ failure [125]. The usefulness of lactate determina￾tion in trauma patients is well established; however, the
reliability of this measure may be lower when traumatic
injury is associated with alcohol consumption, because
alcohol itself can increase the level of lactate in the
blood. In alcohol associated-trauma, therefore, base defi￾cit may be a better predictor of prognosis than lactate
[126].
Similar to the predictive value of lactate levels, the
initial base deficit, obtained either from arterial or per￾ipheral venous blood [127] has been established as a
potent independent predictor of mortality in patients
with traumatic-hemorrhagic shock [126]. Davis and col￾leagues [128] stratified the extent of base deficit into
three categories: mild (-3 to -5 mEq/l), moderate (-6 to
-9 mEq/l) and severe (<-10 mEq/l), and established a
significant correlation between the admission base defi￾cit, transfusion requirements within the first 24 h and
the risk of post-traumatic organ failure or death [128].
The same group of authors showed that the base deficit
is a better prognostic marker of death than the pH in
arterial blood gas analyses [129]. Furthermore, the base
deficit was shown to represent a highly sensitive marker
for the extent of post-traumatic shock and mortality,
both in adult and paediatric patients [130,131].
In contrast to the data on lactate levels in haemorrha￾gic shock, reliable large-scale prospective studies on the
correlation between base deficit and outcome are still
lacking. Although both the base deficit and serum lac￾tate levels are well correlated with shock and resuscita￾tion, these two parameters do not strictly correlate with
each other in severely injured patients [132]. Therefore,
the independent assessment of both parameters is
recommended for the evaluation of shock in trauma
patients [119,121,132].

Coagulation monitoring
Recommendation 12 We recommend that routine
practice to detect post-traumatic coagulopathy
include the early, repeated and combined measure￾ment of prothrombin time (PT), activated partial
thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen and plate￾lets. (Grade 1C)
We recommend that viscoelastic methods also be
performed to assist in characterising the coagulopa￾thy and in guiding haemostatic therapy. (Grade 1C)
Rationale
Standard coagulation monitoring comprises the early and
repeated determination of PT, APTT, platelet counts and
fibrinogen. Increasing emphasis focuses on the impor￾tance of fibrinogen and platelet measurements. It is often
assumed that the conventional coagulation screens
(international normalised ratio (INR) and APTT) moni￾tor coagulation; however, these tests monitor only the
initiation phase of blood coagulation, and represent only
the first 4% of thrombin production [133]. It is, therefore,
possible that the conventional coagulation screen appears
normal, while the overall state of blood coagulation is
abnormal [134-139]. In addition, the delay in detection of
traumatic coagulopathy can influence outcome, and the
turn-around time of thromboelastometry has been
shown to be significantly shorter compared to conven￾tional laboratory testing, with a time savings of about 30
to 60 minutes [136,140,141]. Viscoelastic testing may also
be useful in the detection of coagulation abnormalities
associated with the use of direct thrombin inhibitors,
such as dabigatran, argatroban, bivalirudin or hirudin.
Furthermore, (early) variables of clot firmness assessed
by viscoelastic testing have been shown to be good pre￾dictors for the need for massive transfusion, the inci￾dence of thrombotic/thromboembolic events and for
mortality in surgical and trauma patients [136,142-151].
Therefore, complete and rapid monitoring of blood coa￾gulation and fibrinolysis using viscoelastic methods may
facilitate a more accurate targeting of therapy.
Tools, such as thromboelastometry and portable coa￾gulometers, have been developed to detect coagulopathy
in the emergency room or at the bedside, improving the
availability of real-time data to guide patient manage￾ment. Portable coagulometers that provide INR or APTT
seem to provide acceptable accuracy for point-of-care
INR testing in the emergency department compared with
laboratory-based methods [152,153], but are limited by
the usefulness of the parameters measured.
The number of publications describing the use of viscoe￾lastic methodology is rapidly increasing; however, the
methods employed by different investigators differ signifi￾cantly, highlighting a need for standardisation of the tech￾nique [154,155]. Case series using viscoelastic testing to
assess trauma patients have been published. One study
applied rotation thrombelastography to 23 patients, but
without a comparative standard [134]. Another study
found a poor correlation between rotation thrombelasto￾graphy and conventional coagulation parameters [14].
Johanssen et al. [135] implemented a haemostatic resusci￾tation regime (early platelets and fresh frozen plasma
(FFP)) guided using thrombelastography in a before-and￾after study (n = 832), which showed improved outcomes.
In a retrospective study of cardiovascular surgery patients
(n = 3,865), the combined use of thromboelastometry and
portable coagulometry resulted in a reduction in blood
product transfusion and thromboembolic events, but did
not influence mortality [156]. Rapid thrombelastography is
a new variant of viscoelastic testing in which coagulation
is initiated by the addition of kaolin and tissue factor that
appears to reduce the measurement time compared with
conventional thrombelastography [157]. Despite the wide￾spread use of viscoelastic methods, some limitations must
be kept in mind. Larsen et al. found that thrombelastogra￾phy was unable to distinguish coagulopathies caused by
dilution from thrombocytopenia, whereas thromboelsto￾metry was indeed capable of distinguishing these two dif￾ferent types of coagulopathy and suggesting the correct
treatment [158]. The use of thrombelastography may thus
lead to unnecessary transfusion with platelets, whereas the
application of thromboelastometry may result in goal￾directed fibrinogen substitution. Although rapidly increas￾ing, at present controversy remains regarding the utility of
viscoelastic methods for the detection of post-traumatic
coagulopathy. One limitation of viscoelastic tests is the
lack of sensitivity to detect and monitor platelet dysfunc￾tion due to antiplatelet drugs. If platelet dysfunction is
expected, point-of-care platelet function tests, for example,
whole blood impedance aggregometry, should be used in
addition to viscoelastic tests [159,160]. More research is
required in this area, and in the meantime physicians
should use their own judgement when developing local
policies.
It is theoretically possible that the pattern of change in
measures of coagulation, such as D-dimers, may help to
identify patients with ongoing bleeding. However, a sin￾gle publication showed that the positive predictive value
of D-dimers is only 1.8% in the postoperative and/or
posttraumatic setting [161]; therefore, traditional meth￾ods of detection for ongoing bleeding, such as serial
clinical evaluation of radiology (ultrasound, CT or
angiography) should be used.
III. Tissue oxygenation, fluid and hypothermia
Tissue oxygenation
Recommendation 13 We recommend a target systolic
blood pressure of 80 to 90 mmHg until major bleed￾ing has been stopped in the initial phase following
trauma without brain injury. (Grade 1C)
Spahn et al. Critical Care 2013, 17:R76
http://ccforum.com/content/17/2/R76
Page 10 of 45

We recommend that a mean arterial pressure ≥80
mmHg be maintained in patients with combined
haemorrhagic shock and severe TBI (GCS ≤8).
(Grade 1C)
Rationale
In order to maintain tissue oxygenation, traditional
treatment of trauma patients used early and aggressive
fluid administration to restore blood volume. This
approach may, however, increase the hydrostatic pres￾sure on the wound, cause dislodgement of blood clots, a
dilution of coagulation factors and undesirable cooling
of the patient. The concept of low volume fluid resusci￾tation, so-called “permissive hypotension”, avoids the
adverse effects of early aggressive resuscitation while
maintaining a level of tissue perfusion that, although
lower than normal, is adequate for short periods [162].
Its general effectiveness remains to be confirmed in ran￾domised clinical trials; however, two studies published
in the 1990s demonstrated increased survival when a
low and delayed volume fluid resuscitation concept was
used in penetrating [163] or penetrating and blunt [164]
trauma. However, in contrast to these studies, no signifi￾cant differences in survival were found in two further
trials in patients with either penetrating and blunt
trauma [165] or blunt trauma alone [166].
Ten years ago a Cochrane systematic review con￾cluded that there is no evidence from randomised clini￾cal trials for or against early or larger amounts of
intravenous fluids to treat uncontrolled hemorrhage
[167]. However, more recent retrospective analyses
demonstrated that aggressive resuscitation techniques,
often initiated in the pre-hospital setting, may be detri￾mental for trauma patients [5,17,168,169]. One of these
studies showed that this strategy increased the likelihood
that patients with severe extremity injuries developed
secondary abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS)
[168]. In that study, early large-volume crystalloid
administration was the greatest predictor of secondary
ACS. Moreover, another retrospective analysis of the
German Trauma Registry database, including 17,200
multiply-injured patients, showed that the incidence of
coagulopathy increased with increasing volume of IV
fluids administered pre-clinically [5]. Coagulopathy was
observed in >40% of patients with >2,000 ml, in >50%
with >3,000 ml and in >70% with >4,000 ml adminis￾tered. Using the same trauma registry, a retrospective
matched pairs analysis (n = 1,896) demonstrated that
multiply-injured trauma patients with an Injury Severity
Score (ISS) ≥16 points and a systolic blood pressure ≥60
mmHg at the accident site who received pre-hospital
low-volume resuscitation (0 to 1,500 ml) had a higher
survival rate than patients in whom a pre-hospital high￾volume strategy (≥1,501 ml) was used [17]. These results
are supported by another retrospective analysis of
patients from the US National Trauma Data Bank [169].
In this study, the authors analysed 776,734 patients, of
whom about 50% received pre-hospital IV fluid and 50%
did not. The group of patients receiving preoperative IV
fluids were significantly more likely to die (OR 1.11,
95% CI 1.05 to 1.17), an association which was especially
marked in patients with penetrating mechanisms of
injury (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.45), hypotension (OR
1.44, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.59), severe head injury (OR 1.34,
95% CI 1.17 to 1.54) and patients undergoing immediate
surgery (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.50). The authors
concluded that the routine use of pre-hospital IV fluid
for all trauma patients should be discouraged.
Evidence for the restricted initial administration of
intra-hospital fluid is more clear. A recently published
prospective randomised trial analysing the consequences
of a hypotensive resuscitation strategy in trauma
patients with hemorrhagic shock demonstrated a benefit
for the initial intra-hospital hypotensive resuscitation
strategy [170]. In this study, with nearly all of the 90
patients suffering from penetrating trauma, patients who
had at least one documented in-hospital systolic blood
pressure ≤90 mmHg were randomised to a group whose
target minimum mean arterial pressure was 50 mmHg
or 65 mmHg. One major drawback to this study was
that no statistically significant differences between the
actual mean arterial pressure was observed between the
two groups for the duration of the study (64.4 mmHg
vs. 68.5 mmHg, P = 0.15). Although the authors could
not demonstrate a survival difference for the two treat￾ment strategies at Day 30, 24 h postoperative death and
coagulopathy were increased in the group with the
higher target minimum pressure. The patients in this
group received not only more IV fluids overall, but also
more blood product transfusions.
In spite of these recently published data that include
patients with TBI, the low volume approach in hypoten￾sive patients is contraindicated in TBI and spinal inju￾ries, because an adequate perfusion pressure is crucial
to ensure tissue oxygenation of the injured central ner￾vous system [171]. In addition, the concept of permis￾sive hypotension should be carefully considered in the
elderly patient, and may be contraindicated if the patient
suffers from chronic arterial hypertension [172].
Fluid therapy
Recommendation 14 We recommend that fluid ther￾apy be initiated in the hypotensive bleeding trauma
patient. (Grade 1A)
We recommend that crystalloids be applied initi￾ally to treat the hypotensive bleeding trauma patient.
(Grade 1B)
We recommend that hypotonic solutions, such as
Ringer’s lactate, be avoided in patients with severe
head trauma. (Grade 1C)
Spahn et al. Critical Care 2013, 17:R76
http://ccforum.com/content/17/2/R76
Page 11 of 45

If colloids are administered, we recommend use
within the prescribed limits for each solution.
(Grade 1B)
We suggest that hypertonic solutions during initial
treatment be used, but demonstrate no advantage
compared to crystalloids or colloids in blunt trauma
and TBI. (Grade 2B)
We suggest the use of hypertonic solutions in
hemodynamically unstable patients with penetrating
torso trauma. (Grade 2C)
Rationale
Although fluid resuscitation is the first step to restore tis￾sue perfusion in severe haemorrhagic shock, it is still
unclear whether colloids or crystalloids, and more specifi￾cally, which colloid or which crystalloid, should be used in
the initial treatment of the bleeding trauma patient. The
most recent Cochrane meta-analysis on the type of fluid,
colloids or crystalloids, could not demonstrate that col￾loids reduce the risk of death compared to resuscitation
with crystalloids [173]. The authors compared albumin
with plasma protein fraction, performing an analysis of
23 trials that included a total of 7,754 patients. Hydro￾xyethyl starch (HES) was evaluated in an analysis of 17
trials that included a total of 1,172 patients, modified gela￾tine was assessed in 11 trials that included a total of 506
patients, and 9 trials that included a total of 834 patients
examined the effectiveness of dextran. The authors con￾cluded that the use of colloids is only justified in the con￾text of RCTs, since they could not show any beneficial
effect of colloids, which are also more expensive than crys￾talloids. Therefore, the initial administration of crystalloids
to treat the hypotensive bleeding trauma patient seems to
be justified. Moreover, it was shown that large volume
crystalloid administration is not independently associated
with multiple organ failure [174]. In contrast, if high ratios
of FFP:RBC (red blood cells) cannot be administered to
trauma patients, resuscitation with at least 1 l crystalloid
per unit RBC seems to be associated with reduced overall
mortality [175]. If crystalloids are used, hypotonic solu￾tions, such as Ringer’s lactate, should be avoided in
patients with TBI in order to minimize a fluid shift into
the damaged cerebral tissue. In addition, the use of solu￾tions with the potential to restore pH may be advanta￾geous, since a recent study demonstrated that Ringer’s
acetate solution more rapidly ameliorated splanchnic dys￾oxia, as evidenced by gastric tonometry, than Ringer’s
lactate [176]. Whether an advantage exists for certain iso￾tonic crystalloids associated with reduced morbidity or
mortality remains to be evaluated.
So far it is not clear whether, and if so, which colloids
should be used after initial infusion of crystalloids. Bunn
et al. published a Cochrane meta-analysis with the aim
of comparing the effects of different colloid solutions in
patients thought to need volume replacement [177].
From this review, there is no evidence that one colloid
solution is more effective or safer than any other,
although the confidence intervals were wide and do not
exclude clinically significant differences between col￾loids. In contrast, another recent meta-analysis, which
included 69 clinical studies with a total of 10,382
patients published since 2002, showed that acute kidney
injury and impaired coagulation associated with different
HES solutions as possible side effects [178]. However,
this analysis was largely influenced by data from the so￾called VISEP trial in septic patients [179]. In this trial
an older hypertonic HES solution (200/0.5) was used
and frequently administered in excess of the maximal
permissible dose. Nevertheless, another study in septic
patients showed similar negative results [180]. So far,
only one recently published small RCT described a ben￾efit for a HES solution. HES (130/0.4) provided signifi￾cantly better lactate clearance and less renal injury than
saline in 67 penetrating trauma patients [181]. Because
only 42 blunt trauma patients were included in the
study, no differences in these parameters could be
observed using the different solutions. Therefore, if col￾loids are administered, dosing should be within the pre￾scribed limits and, if HES is employed, a modern HES
solution should be used.
Promising results have been obtained using hypertonic
solutions. In 2008, a double-blind RCT in 209 patients
with blunt traumatic injuries analysed the effect of treat￾ment with 250 ml 7.5% hypertonic saline and 6% dex￾tran 70 compared to lactated Ringer’s solution on organ
failure [182]. The intent-to-treat analysis demonstrated
no significant difference in organ failure and in acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-free survival.
However, there was improved ARDS-free survival in the
subset (19% of the population) requiring 10 U or more
of packed RBC [182]. Another study comparing hyper￾tonic saline dextran with normal saline for resuscitation
in hypotension from penetrating torso injuries showed
improved survival in the hypertonic saline dextran
group when surgery was required [183]. A clinical trial
with brain injury patients found that hypertonic saline
reduced intracranial pressure more effectively than dex￾tran solutions with 20% mannitol when compared in
equimolar dosing [184]. However, Cooper et al. found
almost no difference in neurological function six months
after TBI in patients who had received pre-hospital
hypertonic saline resuscitation compared to conven￾tional fluid [185]. The validity of these results was sup￾ported by the meta-analysis of Perel and Roberts, which
did not demonstrate beneficial effects of hypertonic
solutions [173]. The eight trials with 1,283 randomised
participants compared dextran in hypertonic crystalloid
with isotonic crystalloid and demonstrated a pooled RR
of 1.24 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.65). Moreover, two recently
Spahn et al. Critical Care 2013, 17:R76
http://ccforum.com/content/17/2/R76
Page 12 of 45

published large prospective randomised multi-centre
studies by Bulger and co-workers [186,187] that were
not included in this meta-analysis analysed the effect of
out-of-hospital administration of hypertonic fluids on
neurologic outcome following severe TBI and survival
after traumatic hypovolaemic shock. These studies were
not able to demonstrate any advantage compared to
normal 0.9% saline among the 2,184 patients included.
In conclusion, the evidence suggests that hypertonic sal￾ine solutions are safe, but will neither improve survival
nor improve neurological outcome after TBI.
Vasopressors and inotropic agents
Recommendation 15 We suggest administration of
vasopressors to maintain target arterial pressure in
the absence of a response to fluid therapy. (Grade 2C)
We suggest infusion of an inotropic agent in the
presence of myocardial dysfunction. (Grade 2C)
Rationale
The first step in shock resuscitation is to rapidly restore
mean arterial pressure and systemic blood flow to pre￾vent regional hypoperfusion and tissue hypoxia. Fluid
resuscitation is the first strategy applied to restore mean
arterial pressure in hemorrhagic shock. However, vaso￾pressor agents may also be transiently required to sus￾tain life and maintain tissue perfusion in the presence of
life-threatening hypotension, even when fluid expansion
is in progress and hypovolaemia has not yet been
corrected.
Norepinephrine (NE) is often used to restore arterial
pressure in septic and haemorrhagic shock. It is now
recommended as the agent of choice for this purpose
during septic shock [188]. NE is a sympathomimetic
agent with predominantly vasoconstrictive effects.
Arterial a-adrenergic stimulation increases arterial resis￾tance and may increase cardiac afterload, and NE exerts
both arterial and venous a-adrenergic stimulation [189].
Indeed, in addition to its arterial vasoconstrictor effect,
NE induces venoconstriction at the level of the splanch￾nic circulation in particular, which increases the pres￾sure in capacitance vessels and actively shifts splanchnic
blood volume to the systemic circulation [190]. This
venous adrenergic stimulation may recruit some blood
from the venous unstressed volume, that is, the blood
volume filling the blood vessels, without generating an
intravascular pressure. Moreover, stimulation of b2-adre￾nergic receptors decreases venous resistance and
increases venous return [190].
Animal studies using models of uncontrolled hemor￾rhage have suggested that NE infusion reduces the
amount of fluid resuscitation required to achieve a given
arterial pressure target, is associated with lower blood
loss and significantly improves survival [191]. However,
the effects of NE have not been rigorously investigated in
humans with haemorrhagic shock. An interim analysis
performed during an ongoing multi-centre prospective
cohort study suggested that the early use of vasopressors
for haemodynamic support after haemorrhagic shock
may be deleterious compared to aggressive volume resus￾citation and should be used cautiously [192]. This study
has several limitations, however. First, this was a second￾ary analysis of a prospective cohort study and was not
designed to answer the specific hypothesis tested and,
second, the group receiving vasopressors had a higher
rate of thoracotomy. Thus, a prospective study to define
the effect of vasopressors in haemorrhagic shock is
clearly needed. Vasopressors may be useful if used transi￾ently to sustain arterial pressure and maintain tissue per￾fusion in face of a life-threatening hypotension. If used,
it is essential to respect the recommended objectives for
arterial pressure (systolic arterial pressure 80 to 90
mmHg).
Because vasopressors may increase cardiac afterload if
the infusion rate is excessive or left ventricular function
is already impaired, an assessment of cardiac function
during the initial ultrasound examination is essential.
Cardiac dysfunction could be altered in the trauma
patient following cardiac contusion, pericardial effusion
or secondary to brain injury with intracranial hyperten￾sion. The presence of myocardial dysfunction requires
treatment with an inotropic agent, such as dobutamine
or epinephrine. In the absence of an evaluation of cardiac
function or cardiac output monitoring, as is often the
case in the early phase of haemorrhagic shock manage￾ment, cardiac dysfunction must be suspected in the pre￾sence of a poor response to fluid expansion and NE.
Temperature management
Recommendation 16 We recommend early applica￾tion of measures to reduce heat loss and warm the
hypothermic patient in order to achieve and main￾tain normothermia. (Grade 1C)
We suggest that hypothermia at 33 to 35ºC for ≥48 h
be applied in patients with TBI once bleeding from
other sources has been controlled. (Grade 2C)
Rationale
Hypothermia, defined as a core body temperature
<35ºC, is associated with acidosis, hypotension and coa￾gulopathy in severely injured patients. In a retrospective
study with 122 patients, hypothermia was an ominous
clinical sign, accompanied by high mortality and blood
loss [193]. The profound clinical effects of hypothermia
ultimately lead to higher morbidity and mortality, and
hypothermic patients require more blood products
[194].
Hypothermia is associated with an increased risk of
severe bleeding, and hypothermia in trauma patients
represents an independent risk factor for bleeding and
death [195]. The effects of hypothermia include altered
platelet function, impaired coagulation factor function (a
Spahn et al. Critical Care 2013, 17:R76

1ºC drop in temperature is associated with a 10% drop
in function), enzyme inhibition and fibrinolysis
[196,197]. Body temperatures below 34ºC compromise
blood coagulation, but this has only been observed
when coagulation tests (PT and APTT) are carried out
at the low temperatures seen in patients with hypother￾mia, and not when assessed at 37ºC as is routine prac￾tice for such tests. Steps to prevent hypothermia and
the risk of hypothermia-induced coagulopathy include
removing wet clothing, covering the patient to avoid
additional heat loss, increasing the ambient temperature,
forced air warming, warm fluid therapy and, in extreme
cases, extracorporeal re-warming devices [198,199].
Whereas hypothermia should be avoided in patients
without TBI, contradictory results have been observed
in meta-analyses that examine mortality and neurologi￾cal outcomes associated with mild hypothermia in TBI,
possibly due to the different exclusion and inclusion cri￾teria for the studies used for the analysis [200-202]. The
speed of induction and duration of hypothermia may be
important factors that influence the benefit associated
with this treatment. It has been shown that five days of
long-term cooling is more efficacious than two days of
short-term cooling when mild hypothermia is used to
control refractory intracranial hypertension in adults
with severe TBI [203]. Obviously, the time span of
hypothermia is crucial, because a recent prospective
RCT in 225 children with severe TBI showed that
hypothermic therapy initiated within 8 h after injury
and continued for 24 h did not improve the neurological
outcome and may increase mortality [204]. Furthermore,
the mode of cerebral hypothermia induction may influ￾ence its effectiveness. In a RCT comparing non-invasive
selective brain cooling (33 to 35°C) in 66 patients with
severe TBI and mild systemic hypothermia (rectal tem￾perature 33 to 35°C) and a control group not exposed
to hypothermia, natural rewarming began after three
days. Mean intracranial pressure (ICP) 24, 48 or 72 h
after injury was significantly lower in the selective brain
cooling group than in the control group [205]. In
another study, the difference in the intracranial pressure
using two different levels of hypothermia was examined.
However, this observational study failed to demonstrate
differences in ICP reduction using either 35°C or 33°C
hypothermia [206].
The most recent meta-analysis divided the 12 RCTs
analysing the effect of mild hypothermia compared to
standard treatment for TBI in 1,327 patients into 2 sub￾groups based on cooling strategy: short term (≤48 h)
and long-term or goal-directed (>48 h and/or continued
until normalisation of ICP) [207]. Although the authors
demonstrated a lower mortality (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.62
to 0.85) and more positive neurologic outcomes (RR
1.52, 95% CI 1.28 to 1.80) for all 12 studies in favour of
the hypothermia-treated patients, these beneficial effects
could neither be shown with respect to mortality (RR
0.98, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.30) nor neurologic outcome (RR
1.31, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.83) if only the short-term cooling
studies were analysed. In contrast, among the eight stu￾dies of long-term or goal-directed cooling, mortality was
reduced (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.76) and good neuro￾logic outcome was more common (RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.44
to 1.96). These results are in line with a meta-analysis
performed two years earlier [208]. Unfortunately, these
results were not confirmed by the National Acute Brain
Injury Study: Hypothermia II (NABIS: H II), which was
a RCT of 232 patients with severe brain injury who
were enrolled within 2.5 h of injury and either randomly
assigned to hypothermia (35°C followed by 33°C for 48
h and then gradually rewarmed) or treated at nor￾mothermia [209]. Due to secondary exclusion criteria,
only 52 patients remained in the hypothermia group
and only 45 in the normothermia group, which was also
one reason that the trial was stopped for futility after
3.5 years. Neither mortality nor the neurological out￾come demonstrated a benefit for hypothermia as a pri￾mary neuroprotective strategy in patients with severe
TBI.
In conclusion, prolonged hypothermia may be consid￾ered in patients with isolated head trauma after hemor￾rhage has been arrested. If mild hypothermia is applied
in TBI, cooling should take place within the first 3 h fol￾lowing injury, preferably using selective brain cooling by
cooling the head and neck, be maintained at least for
>48 h, rewarming should last 24 h and the cerebral per￾fusion pressure should be maintained at >50 mmHg
(systolic blood pressure ≥70 mmHg). Patients most
likely to benefit from hypothermia are those with a
Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) at admission between 4
and 7 [202]. Possible side effects are hypotension, hypo￾volaemia, electrolyte disorders, insulin resistance and
reduced insulin secretion and increased risk of infection
[202]. Nevertheless, a recent case control study did not
reveal any evidence that a 48-h hypothermic period
increases the risk of infection in patients after TBI trea￾ted with selective gut decontamination [210]. Further
studies are warranted to investigate the postulated bene￾fit of hypothermia in TBI taking these important factors
into account.
Erythrocytes
Recommendation 17 We recommend a target haemo￾globin (Hb) of 7 to 9 g/dl. (Grade 1C)
Rationale
Oxygen delivery to the tissues is the product of blood
flow and arterial oxygen content, which is directly
related to the Hb concentration. A decrease in Hb may,
therefore, be expected to result in tissue hypoxia. How￾ever, physiologic responses to acute normovolaemic
Spahn et al. Critical Care 2013, 17:R76
http://ccforum.com/content/17/2/R76
Page 14 of 45

anaemia, including macro- and microcirculatory changes
in blood flow, can compensate for the decrease in Hb
concentration.
No prospective RCT has compared restrictive and lib￾eral transfusion regimens in trauma, but 203 trauma
patients from the Transfusion Requirements in Critical
Care trial [211] were re-analysed [212]. A restrictive
transfusion regimen (Hb transfusion trigger <7.0 g/dl)
resulted in fewer transfusions as compared with the liberal
transfusion regimen (Hb transfusion trigger <10 g/dl) and
appeared to be safe. However, no statistically significant
benefit in terms of multiple organ failure or post-traumatic
infections was observed. It should be emphasised that this
study was neither designed nor powered to answer these
questions with precision. In addition, it cannot be ruled
out that the number of RBC units transfused merely
reflects the severity of injury. Nevertheless, RBC transfu￾sions have been shown in multiple studies to be associated
with increased mortality [213-217], lung injury [217-219],
increased infection rates [220,221] and renal failure in
trauma victims [216]. This ill effect may be particularly
important with RBCs stored for more than 14 days [216].
Despite the lack of high-level scientific evidence for a
specific Hb transfusion trigger in patients with TBI, these
patients are currently transfused in many centres to
achieve a Hb of approximately 10 g/dl [222]. This might
be justified by the finding that increasing the Hb from
8.7 to 10.2 g/dl improved local cerebral oxygenation in
75% of patients [223]. In another preliminary study in
patients with TBI, one to two RBC transfusions at a Hb
of approximately 9 g/dl transiently (three to six hours)
increased cerebral oxygenation, again in approximately
75% of patients [224,225]. A storage time of more than
19 days precluded this effect [224]. In another recent
study, cerebral tissue oxygenation, on average, did not
increase due to an increase in Hb from 8.2 to 10.1 g/dl
[226]. Nevertheless, the authors came to the conclusion,
based on multivariate statistical models, that the changes
in cerebral oxygenation correlated significantly with Hb
concentration [226]. This conclusion, however, was ques￾tioned in the accompanying editorial [227]. In an initial
outcome study the lowest Hct was correlated with
adverse neurological outcome and RBC transfusions were
also found to be an independent factor predicting adverse
neurological outcome [228]. Interestingly, the number of
days with a Hct below 30% was found to be correlated
with an improved neurological outcome [228]. In an out￾come study of 1,150 patients with TBI, RBC transfusions
were found to be associated with a two-fold increased
mortality and a three-fold increased complication rate
[229]. A recent retrospective observational analysis of
139 TBI patients suggests that increasing Hct above 28%
during the initial unstable operating room phase follow￾ing severe TBI is not associated with improved outcome
as determined by the extended Glasgow outcome scale
after six months [230]. In another retrospective study of
234 patients with severe TBI, anaemia (defined as a Hb
level <10 g/dl) in the emergency department or ICU is
not a risk factor for poor outcome [231]. Therefore,
patients with severe TBI should not be managed with an
Hb transfusion threshold different than that of other cri￾tically ill patients.
Erythrocytes contribute to haemostasis by influencing
the biochemical and functional responsiveness of acti￾vated platelets via the rheological effect on platelet mar￾gination and by supporting thrombin generation [232];
however, the optimal Hct or Hb concentration required
to sustain haemostasis in massively bleeding patients is
unclear. Further investigations into the role of the Hb
concentration on haemostasis in massively transfused
patients are, therefore, warranted.
The effects of the Hct on blood coagulation have not
been fully elucidated [233]. An acute reduction of the
Hct results in an increase in the bleeding time
[234,235], with restoration upon re-transfusion [234].
This may relate to the presence of the enzyme elastase
on the surface of RBC membranes, which may activate
coagulation factor IX [236,237]. However, a moderate
reduction of the Hct does not increase blood loss from
a standard spleen injury [235], and an isolated in vitro
reduction of the Hct did not compromise blood coagu￾lation as assessed by thromboelastometry [238].
IV. Rapid control of bleeding
Early abdominal bleeding control
Recommendation 18 We recommend that early
bleeding control of the abdomen be achieved using
packing, direct surgical bleeding control and the use
of local haemostatic procedures. In the exsanguinat￾ing patient, aortic cross-clamping may be employed
as an adjunct. (Grade 1C)
Abdominal resuscitative packing is an early part of the
post-traumatic laparotomy to identify major injuries and
sources of hemorrhage [239,240]. If bleeding cannot be
controlled using packing and conventional surgical tech￾niques when the patient is in extremis or when proximal
vascular control is deemed necessary before opening the
abdomen, aortic cross clamping may be employed as an
adjunct to reduce bleeding and redistribute blood flow
to the heart and brain [241-243]. When blood loss is
significant, surgical measures are unsuccessful and/or
when the patient is cold, acidotic and coagulopathic,
definitive packing may also be the first surgical step
within the concept of damage control [244-253].
Packing aims to compress liver ruptures or exert
direct pressure on the sources of bleeding [239,240,
244-248,250-252]. The definitive packing of the abdomen
may allow further attempts to achieve total haemostasis
Spahn et al. Critical Care 2013, 17:R76
http://ccforum.com/content/17/2/R76
Page 15 of 45

through angiography and/or correction of coagulopathy
[253]. The removal of packs should preferably be per￾formed only after 48 h to lower the risk of re-bleeding
[250,251]. Although clinical experience with the concept
of damage control is good, the scientific evidence is lim￾ited [254].
Pelvic ring closure and stabilisation
Recommendation 19 We recommend that patients
with pelvic ring disruption in haemorrhagic shock
undergo immediate pelvic ring closure and stabilisa￾tion. (Grade 1B)
Packing, embolisation and surgery
Recommendation 20 We recommend that patients
with ongoing haemodynamic instability despite ade￾quate pelvic ring stabilisation receive early preperito￾neal packing, angiographic embolisation and/or
surgical bleeding control. (Grade 1B)
Rationale
The mortality rate of patients with severe pelvic ring
disruptions and haemodynamic instability remains unac￾ceptably high [255]. The early detection of these injuries
and initial efforts to reduce disruption and stabilise the
pelvis as well as contain bleeding is therefore crucial.
Markers of pelvic hemorrhage include anterior-posterior
and vertical shear deformations on standard roentgen￾ograms, CT ‘blush’ (active arterial extravasation), bladder
compression pressure, pelvic haematoma volumes >500
ml evident by CT and ongoing haemodynamic instability
despite adequate fracture stabilisation [256,257].
The initial therapy of pelvic fractures includes control
of venous and/or cancellous bone bleeding by pelvic clo￾sure. Some institutions use primarily external fixators to
control hemorrhage from pelvic fractures [257], but pel￾vic closure may also be achieved using a bed sheet, pelvic
binder or a pelvic C-clamp [258]. In addition to the pelvic
closure, fracture stabilisation and the tamponade effect of
the haematoma, pre-, extra- or retroperitoneal packing
will reduce or stop the venous bleeding [259-262].
Pre-peritoneal packing decreases the need for pelvic
embolisation and may be performed simultaneously or
soon after initial pelvic fracture stabilisation. Pelvic pack￾ing could potentially aid in early intrapelvic bleeding con￾trol and provide crucial time for more selective
management of hemorrhage [260,262]. The technique
can be combined with a consecutive laparotomy if
deemed necessary [259,260]. This may decrease the high
mortality rate observed in patients with major pelvic inju￾ries who underwent laparotomy as the primary interven￾tion. As a consequence, it was recommended that non￾therapeutic laparotomy be avoided [263].
Angiography and embolisation are currently accepted
as a highly effective means with which to control arterial
bleeding that cannot be controlled by fracture stabilisa￾tion [256-259,262-268]. Martinelli et al. [269] report on
the use of intra-aortic balloon occlusion to reduce
bleeding and permit transport to angiography. In con￾trast, Morozumi et al. [270] suggest the use of mobile
digital subtraction angiography in the emergency depart￾ment for arterial embolisation performed by trauma sur￾geons themselves. A number of authors stress that
permissive hypotension while obtaining pelvic stabilisa￾tion and/or angiography (damage control resuscitation,
hypertonic solutions, controlled hypothermia) could
achieve better survival [170,271,272]. Controversy exists
about the indications and optimal timing of angiography
in haemodynamically unstable patients [262]. Institu￾tional differences in the capacity to perform timely
angiography and embolisation may explain the different
treatment algorithms suggested by many authors
[255,260,262,263,268,273,274]. Nevertheless, the general
consensus is that a multidisciplinary approach to these
severe injuries is required.
Damage control surgery
Recommendation 21 We recommend that damage con￾trol surgery be employed in the severely injured patient
presenting with deep haemorrhagic shock, signs of
ongoing bleeding and coagulopathy. (Grade 1B)
Other factors that should trigger a damage control
approach are severe coagulopathy, hypothermia,
acidosis, an inaccessible major anatomic injury, a
need for time-consuming procedures or concomitant
major injury outside the abdomen. (Grade 1C)
We recommend primary definitive surgical manage￾ment in the haemodynamically stable patient and in
the absence of any of the factors above. (Grade 1C)
Rationale
The severely injured patient arriving to the hospital with
continuous bleeding or deep haemorrhagic shock gener￾ally has a poor chance of survival unless early control of
bleeding, proper resuscitation and blood transfusion are
achieved. This is particularly true for patients who pre￾sent with uncontrolled bleeding due to multiple penetrat￾ing injuries or patients with major abdominal injury and
unstable pelvic fractures with bleeding from fracture sites
and retroperitoneal vessels. The common denominator in
these patients is the exhaustion of physiologic reserves
with resulting profound acidosis, hypothermia and coa￾gulopathy, also known as the “bloody vicious cycle” or
“lethal triad”. In 1983, Stone described the techniques of
abbreviated laparotomy, packing to control hemorrhage
and of deferred definitive surgical repair until coagulation
has been established [275]. Since then, a number of
authors have described the beneficial results of this con￾cept, now called “damage control” [249,276-278]. The
type of multiply-injured patient who should be subjected
to a damage control strategy is better defined today
[279,280]. It should be considered in patients with major
abdominal injury and a need for adjunctive use of
Spahn et al. Critical Care 2013, 17:R76
http://ccforum.com/content/17/2/R76
Page 16 of 45

angioembolisation, major abdominal injury and a need to
evaluate early on other possible injuries, major abdominal
injury and traumatic amputation of a limb. Factors that
should trigger a damage control approach in the operat￾ing theatre are temperature ≤34°C, pH ≤7.2, an inaccessi￾ble major venous injury, a need for time-consuming
procedures in a patient with suboptimal response to
resuscitation or inability to achieve haemostasis due to
recalcitrant coagulopathy.
Damage control surgery of the abdomen consists of three
components. The first component is an abbreviated resus￾citative laparotomy for control of bleeding, the restitution
of blood flow where necessary and the control of contami￾nation. This should be achieved as rapidly as possible with￾out spending unnecessary time on traditional organ repairs
that can be deferred to a later phase. The abdomen is
packed and temporary abdominal closure is performed.
The second component is intensive care treatment, focused
on core re-warming, correction of the acid-base imbalance
and coagulopathy as well as optimising the ventilation and
the haemodynamic status. If complementary angiography
and/or further injury investigation is needed, it should be
performed. The third component is the definitive surgical
repair that is performed only when target parameters have
been achieved [63,249,276-278,281,282]. Although the con￾cept of “damage control” intuitively makes sense, no RCTs
exist to support it. Retrospective studies support the con￾cept showing reduced morbidity and mortality rates in
selective populations [278].
The same “damage control” principles have been applied
to orthopaedic injuries in severely injured patients. Scalea
et al. were the first to coin the term “damage control
orthopaedics” [283]. Relevant fractures are primarily stabi￾lised with external fixators rather than primary definitive
osteosynthesis [265,283-285]. The less traumatic and
shorter duration of the surgical procedure aims to reduce
the secondary trauma load. Definitive osteosynthesis sur￾gery can be performed after 4 to 14 days when the patient
has recovered sufficiently. Retrospective clinical studies
and prospective cohort studies seem to support the con￾cept of damage control. The only available randomised
study shows an advantage for this strategy in “borderline”
patients [285]. The damage control concept has also been
described for thoracic and neurosurgery as well as for
post-traumatic anaesthesia [286-288].
Local haemostatic measures
Recommendation 22 We recommend the use of topi￾cal haemostatic agents in combination with other
surgical measures or with packing for venous or
moderate arterial bleeding associated with parenchy￾mal injuries. (Grade 1B)
Rationale
A wide range of local haemostatic agents are currently
available for use as adjuncts to traditional surgical
techniques to obtain haemorrhagic control. These topi￾cal agents can be particularly useful when access to the
site of bleeding is difficult. Local haemostatic agents
include collagen, gelatine or cellulose-based products,
fibrin and synthetic glues or adhesives that can be used
for both external and internal bleeding while polysac￾charide-based and inorganic haemostatics are still
mainly used and approved for external bleeding.
The use of topical haemostatic agents should consider
several factors, such as the type of surgical procedure,
cost, severity of bleeding, coagulation status and each
agent’s specific characteristics. Some of these agents
should be avoided when autotransfusion is used, and
several other contraindications need to be considered
[289,290]. The capacity of each agent to control bleed￾ing was initially studied in animals but increasing
experience in humans is now available [289-308].
The different types of local haemostatic agents are
briefly presented below according to their basis and hae￾mostatic capacity:
Collagen-based agents trigger platelet aggregation,
resulting in clot formation when in contact with a
bleeding surface. They are often combined with a pro￾coagulant substance such as thrombin to enhance the
haemostatic effect. A positive haemostatic effect has
been shown in several human studies [291-294].
â€¢ Gelatine-based products can be used alone or in
combination with a pro-coagulant substance [289].
Swelling of the gelatine in contact with blood reduces
the blood flow and, in combination with a thrombin￾based component, enhances haemostasis [295-297]. The
products have been successfully used for local bleeding
control in brain or thyroid surgery when electrocautery
may cause damage to nerves [298] or to control bleed￾ing from irregular surfaces, such as post-sinus surgery
[299].
â€¢ The effect of cellulose-based haemostatic agents
on bleeding has been less studied and only case reports
that support their use are available.
â€¢ Fibrin and synthetic glues or adhesives have both
haemostatic and sealant properties, and their significant
effect on haemostasis has been shown in several human
randomised controlled studies involving vascular, bone,
skin and visceral surgery [300-302]
â€¢ Polysaccharide-based haemostatics can be divided
into two broad categories [289]: N-acetyl-glucosamine￾containing glycosaminoglycans purified from microalgae
and diatoms and microporous polysaccharide haemo￾spheres produced from potato starch. The mechanism of
action is complex and depends on the purity or combina￾tion with other substances, such as cellulose or fibrin. A
number of different products in the form of pads, patches
or bandages are currently available and have been shown
to be efficient for external use and for splanchnic bleeding
Spahn et al. Critical Care 2013, 17:R76
http://ccforum.com/content/17/2/R76
Page 17 of 45

in animals. An observational study showed that hemor￾rhage control was achieved using a poly-N-acetylglucosa￾mine-based bandage applied to 10 patients with severe
hepatic and abdominal injuries, acidosis and clinical coa￾gulopathy [304].
â€¢ Inorganic haemostatics based on minerals, such as
zeolite or smectite, have been used and studied mainly
in the pre-hospital setting and on external bleeding
sources [289,290].
V. Management of bleeding and coagulation
Coagulation support
Recommendation 23 We recommend that monitoring
and measures to support coagulation be initiated as
early as possible. (Grade 1C)
Rationale
Major trauma results not only in bleeding from anato￾mical sites but frequently also in coagulopathy, which is
associated with a several-fold increase in mortality
[4,5,7,9,13,309]. This early coagulopathy of trauma is
found mainly in patients with hypoperfusion (base defi￾cit >6 mE/l) [9,309] and is characterised by an up-regu￾lation of endothelial thrombomodulin, which forms
complexes with thrombin [310].
Early monitoring of coagulation is essential to detect
trauma-induced coagulopathy and to define the main
causes, including hyperfibrinolysis [14,134,137,139,311,
312]. Early therapeutic intervention does improve coagula￾tion tests [313], reduce the need for transfusion of RBC,
FFP and platelets [314,315], reduce the incidence of post￾traumatic multi-organ failure [315], shorten length of hos￾pital stay [314] and may improve survival [316,317].
Therefore, early aggressive treatment is likely to improve
the outcome of severely injured patients [318]. However,
there are also studies in which no survival benefit could be
shown [313,319]; interestingly, in these studies only tradi￾tional lab values, such as PT, aPTT and platelet count,
were used for coagulation monitoring and only FFP and
platelets were used to treat coagulopathy.
Antifibrinolytic agents
Recommendation 24 We recommend that tranexamic
acid be administered as early as possible to the trauma
patient who is bleeding or at risk of significant hemor￾rhage at a loading dose of 1 g infused over 10 minutes,
followed by an intravenous infusion of 1 g over 8 h.
(Grade 1A)
We recommend that tranexamic acid be adminis￾tered to the bleeding trauma patient within 3 h after
injury. (Grade 1B)
We suggest that protocols for the management of
bleeding patients consider administration of the first
dose of tranexamic acid en route to the hospital.
(Grade 2C)
Rationale
Tranexamic acid (trans-4-aminomethylcyclohexane-1-
carboxylic acid; TXA) is a synthetic lysine analogue that
is a competitive inhibitor of plasminogen. TXA is dis￾tributed throughout all tissues, and the plasma half-life
is 120 minutes [320]. The CRASH-2 trial (Clinical Ran￾domisation of Antifibrinolytic therapy in Significant
Hemorrhage) [321] assessed the effects of early adminis￾tration of a short course of TXA on the risk of death,
vascular occlusive events and the receipt of blood pro￾duct transfusion in trauma patients who were bleeding
or at risk of significant bleeding. The trial randomised
20,211 adult trauma patients with or at risk of signifi￾cant bleeding to either TXA (loading dose 1 g over
10 minutes followed by infusion of 1 g over 8 h) or
matching placebo within 8 h of injury. The primary out￾come was death in hospital within four weeks of injury.
All analyses assessed the intention-to-treat population.
All-cause mortality was significantly reduced with TXA
(1,463 (14.5%) TXA vs. 1,613 (16.0%) placebo; relative
risk 0.91, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.97; P = 0.0035), and the risk
of death due to bleeding was significantly reduced (489
(4.9%) vs. 574 (5.7%); relative risk 0.85, 95% CI 0.76 to
0.96; P = 0.0077). There was no evidence that the effect
of TXA on death due to bleeding varied by systolic
blood pressure, Glasgow coma score or type of injury.
The risk of precipitated thrombosis with the use of the
lysine analogues TXA and ε-aminocaproic acid has been
of major theoretical concern; however, CRASH-2
showed that the rate of thrombosis, especially myocar￾dial infarction, was lower with the use of TXA. No
adverse events were described with the use of TXA in
CRASH-2, although an increased rate of seizures has
been described in patients receiving a high dose of TXA
when undergoing cardiac surgery [322].
A further analysis of the CRASH-2 data [323] showed
that early treatment (≤1 h from injury) significantly
reduced the risk of death due to bleeding (198/3,747
(5.3%) events TXA vs. 286/3,704 (7.7%) placebo; relative
risk (RR) 0.68, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.82; P <0.0001). Treatment
administered between 1 and 3 h also reduced the risk of
death due to bleeding (147/3,037 (4.8%) vs. 184/2,996
(6.1%); RR 0.79, 0.64 to 0.97; P = 0.03). Treatment given
after 3 h seemed to increase the risk of death due to bleed￾ing (144/3,272 (4.4%) vs. 103/3,362 (3.1%); RR 1.44, 1.12 to
1.84; P = 0.004), therefore, we recommend that TXA not
be given more than 3 h following injury. In order to
ensure that TXA is given early, the administration of TXA
at the pre-hospital site of injury needs to be planned, and
we suggest that protocols for the management of bleeding
patients consider administration of the first dose of TXA
at the site of injury. Left to clinical judgment for those at
“high risk” or use only in massive blood loss protocols
Spahn et al. Critical Care 2013, 17:R76
http://ccforum.com/content/17/2/R76
Page 18 of 45

receiving TXA, it is estimated that only 40% of these
deaths arise from the high risk patient group [324]. For a
larger impact, TXA should be administered to all patients
with trauma and significant bleeding. Thus guidelines for
managing “massive blood loss” may need to be revised to
include all patients who are bleeding, not just those with
major hemorrhage.
The cost-effectiveness of TXA in trauma has been cal￾culated in three countries [325]: Tanzania as an example
of a low-income country, India as a middle-income
country and the UK as a high-income country. The cost
of TXA administration to 1,000 patients was US$17,483
in Tanzania, US$19,550 in India and US$30,830 in the
UK. The estimated incremental cost per life year gained
of administering TXA is $48, $66 and $64 in Tanzania,
India and the UK, respectively.
ε-aminocaproic acid is also a synthetic lysine analogue
that has a potency 10-fold weaker than that of TXA. It
is administered at a loading dose of 150 mg/kg followed
by a continuous infusion of 15 mg/kg/h. The initial
elimination half-life is 60 to 75 minutes and must,
therefore, be administered by continuous infusion in
order to maintain therapeutic drug levels until the
bleeding risk has diminished. This agent is a potential
alternative to TXA if TXA is not available.
The use of aprotinin is contraindicated in bleeding
trauma patients, now that TXA has been shown to be
efficacious and safe in trauma, and there have been con￾cerns about the safety of aprotinin in other settings
[326].
Calcium
Recommendation 25 We recommend that ionised cal￾cium levels be monitored and maintained within the
normal range during massive transfusion. (Grade 1C)
Rationale
Two recent observational cohort studies have shown
that low ionised calcium levels at admission are asso￾ciated with an increased mortality as well as an
increased need for massive transfusion [327,328]. More￾over, hypocalcaemia during the first 24 h can predict
mortality and the need for multiple transfusion better
than the lowest fibrinogen concentrations, acidosis and
the lowest platelet counts [327]. Measurement of ionised
calcium levels at admission may facilitate the rapid iden￾tification of patients requiring massive transfusion,
allowing for earlier preparation and administration of
appropriate blood products. However, no data are avail￾able to demonstrate that the prevention of ionised hypo￾calcaemia can reduce mortality among patients with
critical bleeding requiring massive transfusion.
Calcium in the extracellular plasma exists either in a
free ionised state (45%) or bound to proteins and other
molecules in a biologically inactive state (55%). The nor￾mal concentration of the ionised form ranges from 1.1
to 1.3 mmol/l and is influenced by the pH. A 0.1 unit
increase in pH decreases the ionised calcium concentra￾tion by approximately 0.05 mmol/l [329]. The availabil￾ity of ionised calcium is essential for the timely
formation and stabilisation of fibrin polymerisation sites,
and a decrease in cytosolic calcium concentration preci￾pitates a decrease in all platelet-related activities [330].
In addition, contractility of the heart and systemic vas￾cular resistance are low at reduced ionised calcium
levels. Combining beneficial cardiovascular and coagula￾tion effects, the level for ionised calcium concentration
should, therefore, be maintained >0.9 mmol/l [330].
Early hypocalcaemia following traumatic injury shows a
significant correlation with the amount of fresh frozen
plasma transfused and also with the amount of infused
colloids, but not with crystalloids. Hypocalcaemia develops
during massive transfusion as a result of the citrate
employed as an anticoagulant in blood products. Citrate
exerts its anticoagulant activity by binding ionised calcium,
and hypocalcaemia is most common in association with
FFP and platelet transfusion because these products con￾tain high citrate concentrations. Citrate undergoes rapid
hepatic metabolism, and hypocalcaemia is generally transi￾ent during standard transfusion procedures. Citrate meta￾bolism may be dramatically impaired by hypoperfusion
states, hypothermia and in patients with hepatic insuffi￾ciency [330].
Plasma
Recommendation 26 We recommend the initial
administration of plasma (fresh frozen plasma (FFP)
or pathogen-inactivated plasma) (Grade 1B) or fibri￾nogen (Grade 1C) in patients with massive bleeding.
If further plasma is administered, we suggest an
optimal plasma:red blood cell ratio of at least 1:2.
(Grade 2C)
We recommend that plasma transfusion be avoided
in patients without substantial bleeding. (Grade 1B)
Rationale
Damage control resuscitation aims to rapidly address
acute traumatic coagulopathy through the early replace￾ment of clotting factors. Plasma (thawed FFP or patho￾gen-inactivated plasma/industrial purified plasma) is
used throughout the world as a source of fibrinogen and
clotting factors. FFP has about 70% of the normal level of
all clotting factors; therefore, it seems to be an adequate
source for replacement; however, different preparations
show great variability [331]. Acidosis as a consequence of
massive hemorrhage has a detrimental effect on the coa￾gulation cascade; a low pH strongly affects the activity of
factor VII and to a lesser extent factor × and factor V
[272]. Moreover, recent studies demonstrated that hypo￾perfusion in trauma patients is associated with an early
and marked reduction in factor V activity and with a less
important decrease in the activity of factors II, VII, IX, ×
Spahn et al. Critical Care 2013, 17:R76

and XI [332]. The marked fall in factor V probably repre￾sents fibrinolytic activation because factor V is very sus￾ceptible to breakdown by fibrinolysis [333]. Trauma￾associated coagulopathy is present in as many as 25% to
30% of patients with major trauma [6,7] on arrival in the
emergency department.
The use of plasma is not hazard-free and is associated
with an increased incidence of post-injury multiple organ
failure [334-336], acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) [334,337], infections [334,338] and with an
increasing complication rate as the volume of plasma
increases [335,336]. As with all products derived from
human blood, the risks associated with FFP treatment also
include circulatory overload, ABO incompatibility, trans￾mission of infectious diseases (including prion diseases)
and mild allergic reactions. Transfusion-related acute lung
injury (TRALI) [339,340] is a severe adverse effect asso￾ciated with the presence of leucocyte antibodies in trans￾fused plasma. Transmission of infectious diseases can be
minimised by the use of pathogen-inactivated plasma
(industrial purified plasma).
Although the formal link between the administration of
FFP, control of bleeding and an improvement in the out￾come of bleeding patients is lacking, some experts would
agree that FFP treatment is beneficial in patients with mas￾sive bleeding or significant bleeding complicated by coagu￾lopathy. Based on reports from the Iraq War, in May 2005
an international expert conference on massive transfusion
at the US Army’s Institute of Surgical Research introduced
a new concept for resuscitation of patients with massive
bleeding and recommended the immediate administration
of coagulation components with a 1:1:1 ratio for RBC,
plasma and platelets [341-343]. In the following few years
retrospective evidence from both military and civilian
practice suggested improved outcomes in patients with
massive bleeding after the adoption of a massive transfu￾sion protocol, including the early administration of high￾dose plasma therapy [344]. In the meantime, 19 studies
[135,313,316, 319,345-359], 6 systematic reviews [360-365]
and 1 meta-analysis [366] have addressed the impact of
FFP:RBC ratio. However, these studies have severe limita￾tions: none are RCTs, all but three [319,348,359] are retro￾spective and the majority have a number of potential
confounders that might introduce relevant bias. The
majority of the authors used massive transfusion (10 RBC
units within 24 h) as the entry criterion, but Davenport
et al. [359] focused on significant bleeding (>4 units RBC),
Borgman et al. [358] used the TASH score to identify
patients who would need a high FPP:RBC ratio, while
other authors used a different time span than 24 h. A sig￾nificant heterogeneity among the different studies is, there￾fore, present. Moreover, FFP needs to be thawed before
administration; therefore it is often not immediately avail￾able. As 50% of patients who die because of hemorrhage
die within the first 6 h, many of them might not live long
enough to receive blood products at the intended ratio,
introducing potential time and survival biases that may
contribute to confounding results [277,352,356,357]. To
avoid this bias some investigators have excluded those
patients who died within a few hours of hospital admission,
but this may introduce a different but relevant bias because
patients who died from exanguination, but could have
benefited from a higher plasma:RBC ratio, are not included
in these analyses [367,368]. For all of these reasons, the
quality of evidence is very low. In general, outcomes were
favourable for patients who received a higher plasma:RBC
ratio; however, the optimal ratio required to achieve an
improvement in the survival rate was not consistent. The
single meta-analysis [366] showed a significant reduction
in the risk of death (OR 0.38, CI 0.24 to 0.60) for trauma
patients undergoing massive transfusion at a plasma:RBC
ratio in the range of 1:2.5 to 1:1, but the authors caution
against the very low level of supporting evidence. The
majority of the systematic reviews reached the same con￾clusions, suggesting an improved mortality with a higher
level of plasma [360-363], though emphasising that an opti￾mal and consistent FFP:RBC ratio has not yet been identi￾fied [365], and there is insufficient evidence to support the
use of a fixed 1:1 ratio [362]. Lier et al. [363] were the only
author group who felt that the evidence was strong enough
to suggest that a ratio of 1:2 to 1:1 FFP:RBC should be tar￾geted. In contrast, a review by Kozek et al. [364] reached
the conclusion that there is inconsistent and contradictory
evidence concerning the efficacy of FFP, and suggested that
fibrinogen might offer some alternative advantage,
although high-quality prospective studies are required
before any conclusion can be drawn.
Interestingly, a recent prospective cohort study by
Davenport et al. [359] analysed coagulation parameters
before and after transfusion of every four units of RBC
with variable rates of plasma by rotational thromboelasto￾metry. These authors observed a maximal haemostatic
effect with a plasma:RBC ratio ranging between 1:2 and
3:4. A higher rate did not bring any additional improve￾ment, and in some patients the haemostatic function dete￾riorated. These data are consistent with the results of
computer-generated models of massive transfusion [277].
Fibrinogen and cryoprecipitate
Recommendation 27 We recommend treatment with
fibrinogen concentrate or cryoprecipitate in the conti￾nuing management of the patient if significant bleed￾ing is accompanied by thromboelastometric signs of a
functional fibrinogen deficit or a plasma fibrinogen
level of less than 1.5 to 2.0 g/l. (Grade 1C)
We suggest an initial fibrinogen concentrate dose of
3 to 4 g or 50 mg/kg of cryoprecipitate, which is
approximately equivalent to 15 to 20 single donor
units in a 70 kg adult. Repeat doses may be guided by

viscoelastic monitoring and laboratory assessment of
fibrinogen levels. (Grade 2C)
Rationale
Fibrinogen is the final component in the coagulation
cascade, the ligand for platelet aggregation and, there￾fore, key to effective coagulation and platelet function
[233,369]. Hypofibrinogenemia is a usual component of
complex coagulopathies associated with massive bleed￾ing. Coagulopathic civilian trauma patients had a fibri￾nogen concentration of 0.9 g/l (interquartile ratio (IQR)
0.5 to 1.5 g/l) in conjunction with a maximum clot firm￾ness (MCF) of 6 mm (IQR 0 to 9 mm) using thromboe￾lastometry, whereas only 2.5% of healthy volunteers had
a MCF of <7 mm [14]. In trauma patients, a MCF of
7 mm was associated with a fibrinogen level of approxi￾mately 2 g/l [14]. During massive blood loss replacement,
fibrinogen is the first coagulation factor to critically
decrease [370]. During postpartum hemorrhage, fibrino￾gen plasma concentration is the only coagulation para￾meter independently associated with progress toward
severe bleeding, with a level <2 g/l having a positive pre￾dictive value of 100% [371].
An early observational study suggested that fibrinogen
substitution can improve survival in combat-related
trauma [372]. Subsequent retrospective reviews of single
centre experiences managing massive blood loss in trauma
patients have suggested that the use of thromboelastome￾try-guided fibrinogen with other blood products reduced
mortality when compared to expected mortality [317],
reduced the exposure to allogeneic blood products [314]
and increased 30-day survival [355]. However, as recent
systematic reviews have shown [364,373], there are no
adequately powered prospective clinical trials to demon￾strate the risk:benefit analysis of using a source of addi￾tional fibrinogen to manage bleeding trauma patients.
Fibrinogen administration using viscoelastic methods
as guidance may be preferable to measuring fibrinogen
levels in the laboratory. Some methodological issues in
the various laboratory methods to measure fibrinogen
concentration remain [374,375], and in the presence of
artificial colloids, such as HES, even the most frequently
recommended method [374], the Clauss method, signifi￾cantly overestimates the actual fibrinogen concentration
[375].
The issue of whether the administration of fibrinogen
via factor concentrate, cryoprecipitate or FFP is associated
with an increased risk of hospital-acquired venous throm￾boembolism has never been addressed. However, fibrino￾gen levels are expected to rise to a level of approximately
7 g/l after major surgery and trauma [376,377] even with￾out intra-operative fibrinogen administration, and the
effect of intra-operative fibrinogen administration on post￾traumatic fibrinogen levels are unknown. Interestingly,
intra-operative administration of fibrinogen concentrate in
patients undergoing cystectomy and cardiac surgery
resulted in higher early postoperative fibrinogen levels but
already at 24 h post-operation fibrinogen levels were iden￾tical in patients with and without intra-operative fibrino￾gen administration [378,379]. Well-designed prospective,
randomised double-blinded studies evaluating the effect of
fibrinogen supplementation are urgently needed.
The rationale for fibrinogen administration should be
read in conjunction with that for plasma (R26).
Platelets
Recommendation 28 We recommend that platelets be
administered to maintain a platelet count above 50 ×
109
/l. (Grade 1C)
We suggest maintenance of a platelet count above
100 × 109
/l in patients with ongoing bleeding and/or
TBI. (Grade 2C)
We suggest an initial dose of four to eight single
platelet units or one aphaeresis pack. (Grade 2C)
Rationale
The role of platelets in the development of traumatic coa￾gulopathy is not fully understood; however, there is weak
scientific evidence to support a particular platelet transfu￾sion threshold in the trauma patient. One small prospec￾tive study performed in massively transfused patients
found a platelet count of <100 × 109
/l as the threshold for
diffuse bleeding [380], and another study indicated a plate￾let count <50 × 109
/l or fibrinogen <0.5 g/l as the most
sensitive laboratory predictors of microvascular bleeding
[381]. Patients with both platelet and fibrinogen values
above these levels had only a 4% chance of developing
microvascular bleeding. A platelet count >100 × 109
/l
further improved survival in patients with massive bleed￾ing due to ruptured aortic abdominal aneurysms treated
proactively with platelet transfusion compared to lower
levels [382].
As a result, expert consensus is that the platelet count
should not be less than the critical level of 50 × 109
/l in
the acutely bleeding patient [383], with some experts
claiming that a higher threshold of 75 × 109
/l provides a
margin of safety [384,385]. A higher target level of 100
× 109
/l has been suggested for those with multiple
trauma, brain injury and massive bleeding [383,384].
Recently, it was found that a platelet count of <100 ×
109
/l was an independent predictor of mortality in
patients with TBI [386].
Furthermore, in most trauma patients, the admission
platelet count is within the normal range [387-389], with
less than 5% of patients arriving in the emergency room
with a platelet count of <100 × 109
/l [7]. In initial acute
loss, the bone marrow and spleen variably release platelets,
and a platelet count of 50 × 109
/l may be anticipated when
approximately two blood volumes have been replaced by
fluid or red cell components [370]. In addition, in patients
exhibiting traumatic coagulopathy, the platelet count does
Spahn et al. Critical Care 2013, 17:R76
http://ccforum.com/content/17/2/R76
Page 21 of 45

not decline to levels that might be expected to contribute
significantly to coagulopathy [389]. However, the platelet
count on admission, may be predictive of outcome as
documented in some cohorts of massively transfused
trauma patients, where platelet count was inversely corre￾lated with injury severity [387], morbidity [386] and mor￾tality [387,388,390].
Thus, a normal platelet count may be insufficient after
severe trauma, and platelet count alone is a weak indica￾tor of platelet transfusion needs because it ignores plate￾let dysfunction. Additionally, platelet function in trauma
patients has been poorly investigated. Severe injury can
result in increased platelet activation, which, along with
decreased function as observed in TBI, was associated
with increased mortality [391]. Similarly, non-survivors
in a small study had minor but significantly more plate￾let defects as assessed by multiplate electrode aggrego￾metry compared to survivors [160]. Recently it was
found that after an injury the platelet dysfunction is pre￾sent even before substantial fluid or blood transfusion
takes place and continues during the resuscitation per￾iod, this suggesting a potential role for early platelet
transfusion [392].
The normal therapeutic dose of platelets is one con￾centrate (60 to 80 × 109 platelets) per 10 kg body
weight. One aphaeresis platelet product, which is
approximately equivalent to six whole blood-derived
units, generally contains approximately 3 to 4 × 1011
platelets in 150 to 450 ml donor plasma [383,385],
depending on local collection practice. A dose of four to
eight platelet units or a single-donor aphaeresis unit is
usually sufficient to provide haemostasis in a thrombo￾cytopenic, bleeding patient and should increase the pla￾telet count by 30 to 50 × 109
/l [393]. The platelet
concentrate transfused must be ABO-identical, or at
least ABO-compatible, in order to provide a good yield
[385].
For the management of traumatic coagulopathy, there is
still no high-quality evidence supporting up-front platelet
transfusion or higher doses given in pre-defined ratios
with other blood products. The only prospective rando￾mised trial evaluating prophylactic platelet transfusion at a
ratio to whole blood of 1:2 versus the same amount of
plasma in patients receiving ≥12 units of whole blood in
12 h concluded that platelet administration did not affect
microvascular non-surgical bleeding [394]. Although most
of the further studies [348,349,354,395-397] and a meta￾analysis including studies published between 2005 and
2010 [398] that investigated the impact of platelet transfu￾sion in severe trauma and massive transfusion showed an
improved survival rate among patients receiving high pla￾telet:RBC ratios, such evidence provided by retrospective
and observational studies may be subject to serious con￾founding factors, such as survivorship bias. The timing of
platelet transfusion in relation to the initiation of RBC/
FFP transfusion was not reported in most of the studies,
and there might be more than one optimal ratio according
to trauma severity, degree and dynamics of blood loss and
previous fluid administration [398]. A recent analysis of a
large prospective cohort showed that high platelet:RBC
ratio was associated with survival benefit as early as 6 h
and throughout the first 24 h, even when time-dependent
fluctuations in component transfusion are accounted for,
suggesting that survivor bias is unlikely [399]. Negative
[400,401] and partially positive results [402] were also
reported in patients with massive transfusion. Interest￾ingly, patients with penetrating injuries [400] and females
[402] do not benefit from high platelet:RBC ratios, and no
difference in mortality was observed in patients with non￾massive transfusion receiving higher platelet:RBC ratios
[403]. When a research intervention (before-and-after
introduction of a massive hemorrhage protocol performed
with high plasma and platelet:RBC ratios) was reported,
improved survival was shown in three studies
[135,344,355], but not in a further study [404]. Therefore,
the administration of high platelet:RBC ratios along with
high plasma:RBC ratios remains controversial.
One additional reason for the lack of clarity is the diffi￾culty in separating the effect of a high platelet:RBC ratio
from the effect of a high plasma:RBC ratio. Patients
receiving a combination of high plasma and high platelet
ratios had an improved 6-h [349,354,399], 24-h [344,
349,395-397,399], 30-day [135,344,348,349,355,395,397],
in hospital [354] and discharge survival [396]. However,
the impact exerted by platelets on survival was not as
strong as that of plasma transfusion [348,396], higher
than the impact of plasma [355] or even absent, in con￾trast to the benefit of increased plasma:RBC ratios [401].
On the contrary, transfusion of a high platelet:RBC ratio
and not a high plasma:RBC ratio was found to be asso￾ciated with improved survival in patients with TBI [405].
One major drawback to these observational studies is
the wide range of platelet:RBC ratios, along with reported
poor compliance with specified platelet ratios during
active resuscitation [406]. As a result, the definition of the
optimal ratio of platelet:RBC transfusion remains elusive.
A potential shortcoming of ratio-driven blood support is
over-transfusion with plasma and platelets, resulting in no
benefit or in added morbidity, such as multiple organ fail￾ure [334]. The age of transfused platelets may also play a
role [407]. Although decreased morbidity due to aggressive
use of plasma and platelets has been reported
[318,349,354], routine early prophylactic platelet transfu￾sion as part of a massive transfusion protocol appears
unjustified at this time
Antiplatelet agents
Recommendation 29 We suggest administration of
platelets in patients with substantial bleeding or
Spahn et al. Critical Care 2013, 17:R76

intracranial hemorrhage who have been treated with
antiplatelet agents. (Grade 2C)
If the patient has been treated with acetylsalicylic
acid alone, we suggest administration of desmopres￾sin (0.3 µg/kg). (Grade 2C)
We suggest the measurement of platelet function
in patients treated or suspected of being treated with
antiplatelet agents. (Grade 2C)
If platelet dysfunction is documented in a patient
with continued microvascular bleeding, we suggest
treatment with platelet concentrates. (Grade 2C)
Rationale
Little is known about the effects of antiplatelet agents
(APAs), mainly aspirin and clopidogrel, on traumatic
bleeding. Data from non-elective orthopaedic procedures
show both increased peri-operative blood loss in patients
taking APAs before surgery [408,409] or no effect [410].
The increase in blood transfusion in orthopaedic patients
on APAs is also controversial [410,411]. However, the pre￾injury use of APAs did not affect morbidity and mortality
in retrospective studies in patients with pelvic fractures
[412] or general trauma without brain injury [413], but did
have an effect in patients with hip fractures [409]. On the
contrary, even mild head trauma (GCS 14 to 15) while on
APAs is associated with a high incidence of intracranial
hemorrhage (ICH) [414-416], and a risk of delayed ICH in
this group of patients mandates a longer period of obser￾vation [417,418]. Moreover, observational studies found a
five-fold increase in traumatic ICH in patients on APAs
[419]. The relationship between outcome and pre-injury
APAs in the setting of ICH is conflicting in both the
trauma [420-424] and stroke literature [425-427], and a
systematic review of the latter has shown that pre-ICH
APA users experienced only modestly increased mortality
(OR 1.27; 95% CI 1.10 to 1.47) and little or no increase in
poor clinical functional outcome (OR 1.10; 95% CI 0.93 to
1.29) [428].
Few studies have directly focused on outcome associated
with a specific APA. Those that have analysed the use of
clopidogrel prior to both spontaneous and traumatic ICH
reported worsened outcome [426,429,430]. Compared to
controls, patients on clopidogrel demonstrated a 14.7-fold
increase in mortality [430], increased morbidity [429] and
a 3-fold increase in disposition to a long-term facility
[430]. On the contrary, pre-injury aspirin did not affect
outcomes in mild to moderate head injury [431] or mor￾tality [432]. Surprisingly, reduced platelet activity has been
shown in patients with ICH in the absence of known
aspirin use [433], and this was associated with more ICH
volume growth and worse three-month outcome [434].
Early platelet dysfunction was also prevalent after severe
TBI in the absence of APAs [435]. However, greater plate￾let inhibition was identified among patients taking a com￾bination of APAs compared to those on single agents
[433]. These findings coupled with the fact that 20 to 30%
of patients are non-responders to aspirin, clopidogrel or
both agents [436] suggest that reliable measures of platelet
function would be useful in the setting of the bleeding
trauma patient to guide clinicians on the use of platelet
transfusion or other reversal agents. Patients with occult
platelet dysfunction could be identified and unnecessary
platelet transfusion could be avoided [432].
Currently, there is no agreement on the optimal assay
for platelet function, and controversy exists as to whether
ICH in the setting of APAs use warrants platelet transfu￾sion. Transfusion of platelets has a low grade recommen￾dation in the guidelines on ICH management in patients
on APAs [437] and is currently indicated for patients on
clopidogrel and traumatic hemorrhage, although its clini￾cal utility remains to be established [438]. Retrospective
studies have failed to show an outcome benefit from plate￾let transfusion in patients on APAs with spontaneous
[427,439] or traumatic ICH [421,440,441]. A meta-analysis
of six small studies of the impact of platelet transfusion on
survival in patients with pre-injury APAs who experienced
ICH, either spontaneous or traumatic, found no clear ben￾efit [442]. Similarly, a systematic review of five retrospec￾tive registry studies on traumatic ICH provides inadequate
evidence to support the routine use of platelet transfusion
in patients with pre-injury antiplatelet use [443]. However,
the timing of platelet administration was not optimal in
some studies [434,439], and a small prospective study
showed that early platelet transfusion, within 12 h of
symptom onset, improved platelet activity and was asso￾ciated with smaller final hemorrhage size and more inde￾pendence at three months [444]. Another explanation for
the observation that platelet transfusion shows no obvious
benefit is that the inhibitory effect of the APAs is not
being normalised due to insufficient dose or recent inges￾tion of APAs, which may inactivate transfused platelets
[444]. The results of a multi-centre RCT on platelet trans￾fusion in patients with APA-associated ICH are awaited
[445].
The suggested dose for normalising platelet activity in
healthy volunteers given aspirin alone or a combination
of aspirin and clopidogrel was 5 and 10 to 15 platelet
units, respectively [446]. Successful peri-operative man￾agement of patients on aspirin and clopidogrel requiring
urgent surgery using two apheresis platelet units was
recently reported [447]. Given that an active metabolite
of clopidogrel persists after cessation of the medication,
and that the half-life of transfused platelets is short,
recurring platelet transfusion may be justified [448].
Besides platelet transfusion, current potential antipla￾telet reversal therapies include desmopressin and recom￾binant activated coagulation factor VII (rFVIIa) [438].
The clinical utility of desmopressin and rFVIIa has not
been assessed for reversal of the effects of pre-injury
Spahn et al. Critical Care 2013, 17:R76

APAs in patients with traumatic ICH. Although desmo￾pressin has been shown to improve platelet function in
volunteers on aspirin [449] and clopidogrel [450], and
peri-operatively in patients with mild inherited platelet
defects [451], the use of desmopressin for acquired
bleeding disorders is not supported by sound clinical
evidence. One older meta-analysis suggested a benefit of
desmopressin in patients taking aspirin [452], and des￾mopressin has been recommended in patients taking
platelet inhibitors and suffering from ICH [438,453].
The standard dose is 0.3 µg/kg diluted in 50 ml saline and
infused over 30 minutes [451]. Recently, it was shown that
identification of impaired platelet function with a platelet
function analyzer PFA-100 [454] or whole blood multiple
electrode aggregometer [455] might be helpful in the iden￾tification of patients who may benefit from desmopressin
therapy. The combined effect of platelet concentrates and
subsequent administration of desmopressin has also been
advocated to enhance the recovery of normal platelet
function [456]. Furthermore, rFVIIa reversed the inhibi￾tory effects of aspirin and clopidogrel in healthy volunteers
[457]. Interestingly, the effective dose was lower than the
dose used in haemophilia patients [458]. In addition, TXA
was shown to partially improve platelet function in
patients treated with dual antiplatelet therapy as measured
by multiple electrode aggregometry [459]. Potential effec￾tiveness in improving haemostasis in trauma patients
receiving APAs was also shown for fibrinogen concentrate
[460].
Desmopressin
Recommendation 30 We suggest that desmopressin
(0.3 µg/kg) be administered in patients treated with
platelet-inhibiting drugs or with von Willebrand dis￾ease. (Grade 2C)
We do not suggest that desmopressin be used rou￾tinely in the bleeding trauma patient. (Grade 2C)
Rationale
Desmopressin (DDAVP; 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vaso￾pressin) enhances platelet adherence and platelet aggregate
growth on human artery subendothelium and is the first
choice in the treatment of bleeding in patients with von
Willebrand disease, a disease which occurs roughly in 1 in
100 patients [461,462]. Two meta-analyses in patients not
diagnosed with von Willebrand disease [463,464] were
able to demonstrate either a trend towards a reduced peri￾operative blood loss [463] or a small significant reduction
in blood transfusion requirements (-0.29 (-0.52 to -0.06)
units per patient) [464]. Patients with impaired platelet
function as assessed by a platelet function analyser [454]
or whole blood multiple electrode aggregometer [455]
may benefit from desmopressin therapy. Concerns regard￾ing possible thromboembolic complications [465] were
not confirmed in the last meta-analysis from 2008 [464].
Desmopressin has never been formally investigated in
general trauma or TBI [438]. Nevertheless, desmopressin
has been recommended in patients treated with platelet
inhibitors, suffering from intracerebral bleeding [438,453]
and in trauma patients with von Willebrand disease [466].
Interestingly, desmopressin prevents the development of
hypothermia-induced impairment of primary haemostasis
[467] and significantly increases platelet aggregation dur￾ing hypothermia and acidosis [468].
Prothrombin complex concentrate
Recommendation 31 We recommend the early use of
prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) for the
emergency reversal of vitamin K-dependent oral
anticoagulants. (Grade 1B)
If a concentrate-based goal-directed strategy is
applied, we suggest that PCC be administered in the
bleeding patient with thromboelastometric evidence
of delayed coagulation initiation. (Grade 2C)
Rationale
Despite the increasing use of PCC, including activated
PCC, there are no large RCTs to support its use other
than in haemophilia [469-471] or for the rapid reversal
of the effect of oral vitamin K antagonists [472-474]. In
the setting of trauma patients treated with pre-injury
warfarin, a retrospective analysis showed that the use of
PCC resulted in a more rapid time to reversal of the
INR [475-478]. Thromboelastometry appears to be a
useful tool to guide PCC therapy in patients with trau￾matic coagulopathy [314,475,479-482]. With an ageing
population, more trauma patients are likely to have been
pre-treated with vitamin K antagonists; therefore, every
trauma unit should have an established management
policy for these patients [476]. Because there are varia￾tions in the production of PCC, the dosage should be
determined according to the instructions of the indivi￾dual manufacturer [483,484].
The use of PCC carries the increased risks of both
venous and arterial thrombosis during the recovery per￾iod; therefore, the risk of a thrombotic complication due
to treatment with PCCs should be weighed against the
need for rapid and effective correction of coagulopathy
[485-488]. Thromboprophylaxis as early as possible after
control of bleeding has been achieved is recommended
in patients who have received PCC.
Novel anticoagulants
Recommendation 32 We suggest the measurement of
substrate-specific anti-factor Xa activity in patients
treated or suspected of being treated with oral anti￾factor Xa agents such as rivaroxaban, apixaban or
endoxaban. (Grade 2C)
If bleeding is life-threatening, we suggest reversal
of rivaroxaban, apixaban and endoxaban with high￾dose (25 to 50 U/kg) PCC. (Grade 2C)
Spahn et al. Critical Care 2013, 17:R76
http://ccforum.com/content/17/2/R76
Page 24 of 45

We do not suggest the administration of PCC in
patients treated or suspected of being treated with
oral direct thrombin inhibitors, such as dabigatran.
(Grade 2B)
Rationale
In recent years, new oral anticoagulants for the prevention
of venous thromboembolism, prevention of stroke in atrial
fibrillation, reduction of cardiovascular events in patients
with acute coronary syndrome and treatment of pulmon￾ary embolism and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) have
been developed. The primary modes of action by these
novel drugs are direct factor Xa inhibition (rivaroxaban,
apixaban and endoxaban) or thrombin inhibition (dabiga￾tran) [489]. We are, therefore, increasingly likely to be
confronted with trauma patients who have been treated
with one of these drugs [490], which exert an effect on
both coagulation tests [490,491] and haemostasis [492].
No published clinical studies and very little clinical
experience in traumatically injured patients who have
been treated with one of these drugs exist [491,493]. How￾ever, it was recently shown that the effect of these drugs
on coagulation tests of factor Xa (rivaroxaban) but not of
factor IIa (dabigatran) antagonists in human volunteers
could be immediately and completely reversed with high￾dose (50 U/kg) PCC [494].
Anti-factor Xa activity can be measured with a sub￾strate-specific anti-factor Xa test in trauma patients
known or suspected to have been treated with factor Xa
antagonists. If anti-factor Xa activity is detected, high-dose
(25 to 50 U/kg) PCC treatment may be initiated. We sug￾gest an initial dose of 25 U/kg, repeated if necessary, as a
cautious approach given the possible thrombotic potential
of PCC products [486]. Factor IIa antagonist treatment
does prolong aPTT and thrombin time but high-dose
(50 U/kg) PCC treatment is inefficient [494]. Aside from a
consideration of haemodialysis [495] or the administration
of factor VIII inhibitor bypassing activity [496], no specific
treatment for patients treated with a factor IIa antagonist
can be recommended at the current time. The involve￾ment of a haematologist with expertise in coagulation
should be considered.
Recombinant activated coagulation factor VII
Recommendation 33 We suggest that the use of
recombinant activated coagulation factor VII (rFVIIa)
be considered if major bleeding and traumatic coa￾gulopathy persist despite standard attempts to con￾trol bleeding and best-practice use of conventional
haemostatic measures. (Grade 2C)
We do not suggest the use of rFVIIa in patients
with intracerebral hemorrhage caused by isolated
head trauma. (Grade 2C)
Rationale
rFVIIa is not a first-line treatment for bleeding and can
be effective only once sources of major bleeding have
been controlled. Once major bleeding from damaged
vessels has been stopped, rFVIIa may be helpful to
induce coagulation in areas of diffuse small vessel coa￾gulopathic bleeding. rFVIIa should be considered only if
first-line treatment with a combination of surgical
approaches, best-practice use of blood products, (RBC,
platelets, FFP and cryoprecipitate/fibrinogen resulting in
Hct above 24%, platelets above 50 × 109
/l and fibrino￾gen above 1.5 to 2.0 g/l), the use of antifibrinolytics and
correction of severe acidosis, severe hypothermia and
hypocalcaemia fail to control bleeding.
Because rFVIIa acts on the patient’s own coagulation
system, adequate numbers of platelets and fibrinogen
levels are needed to allow a thrombin burst to be induced
by the pharmacological, supra-physiological doses of
rFVIIa through direct binding to activated platelets
[497,498]. pH and body temperature should be restored as
near to physiological levels as possible, since even small
reductions in pH and temperature result in slower coagu￾lation enzyme kinetics [196,197,499]. Predictors of a poor
response to rFVIIa were a pH <7.2 (P <0.0001), a platelet
count <100 × 109
/l (P = 0.046), and blood pressure ≤90
mmHg (P <0.0001) at the time of administration of rFVIIa
[500]. Moreover, hypocalcaemia is frequently present in
severely injured patients [501]; therefore, monitoring of
ionised calcium is necessary, and administration of intra￾venous calcium may be required [502].
Despite numerous case studies and series reporting that
treatment with rFVIIa can be beneficial in the treatment
of bleeding following trauma, there are few high quality
studies [503-506]. A multi-centre, randomised, double￾blind, placebo-controlled study examined the efficacy of
rFVIIa in patients with blunt (n = 143) or penetrating (n =
134) trauma [507] and showed that patients with blunt
trauma who survived for more than 48 h assigned to
receive rFVIIa 200 µg/kg after they had received eight
units of RBC and a second and third dose of 100 µg/mg 1
and 3 h later had a reduction in RBC transfusion require￾ments and the need for massive transfusions (>20 units of
RBC) compared to placebo. They also had a significantly
reduced incidence of ARDS. In contrast, there were no sig￾nificant effects in the penetrating trauma patients in this
study, although trends toward reduced RBC requirements
and fewer massive transfusions were observed. Similar
results and trends were observed in other retrospective
studies and case reports [508-510]. A further randomised
clinical trial [511] aimed to evaluate rFVIIa as an adjunct
to direct haemostasis in major trauma patients who bled
four to eight RBC units within 12 h of injury and were still
bleeding despite strict damage control resuscitation and
operative management. Patients were treated with rFVIIa
(200 µg/kg initially; 100 µg/kg at 1 and 3 h) or placebo.
The trial was terminated early (n = 573) due to difficulty
in consenting and enrolling sicker patients and resulting
Spahn et al. Critical Care 2013, 17:R76

Page 25 of 45

low mortality rates that prompted a futility analysis.
Thrombotic adverse events were similar across study
cohorts.
In contrast, the use of rFVIIa in isolated head injury
was found to be harmful in a case-controlled study of
patients with traumatic intracranial hemorrhage, with the
risk of death appearing to increase with administration
regardless of the severity of injury [512]. No reliable evi￾dence from RCTs exists to support the effectiveness of
haemostatic drugs in reducing mortality or disability in
patients with TBI [513].
The required dose(s) of rFVIIa is still under debate.
Whereas the dosing used in the published RCTs in trauma
patients is also recommended by a group of European
experts [514], Israeli guidelines based on findings from a
case series of 36 patients who received rFVIIa on a com￾passionate-use basis [504] propose an initial dose of
120 µg/kg (between 100 and 140 µg/kg) and (if required) a
second and third dose. Pharmacokinetic modelling techni￾ques have shown that the dose regimen for rFVIIa treat￾ment used in the RCT described above is capable of
providing adequate plasma levels of drug to support hae￾mostasis [515].
If rFVIIa is administered, the patient’s next of kin
should be informed that rFVIIa is being used outside the
currently approved indications (off-label use), especially
since the use of rFVIIa may increase the risk of throm￾boembolic complications [516]. A meta-analysis per￾formed by the manufacturer showed a higher risk of
arterial thrombomebolic adverse events (5.6% in patients
receiving rFVIIa versus 3.0% in placebo-treated patients)
among over 2,000 patients enrolled in placebo-controlled
trials outside currently approved indications in various
clinical settings [517]. In trauma patients, however,
rFVIIa use was not associated with an increased risk of
thromboembolic complications [518].
Thromboprophylaxis
Recommendation 34 We suggest mechanical throm￾boprophylaxis with intermittent pneumatic compres￾sion (IPC) and/or anti-embolic stockings as soon as
possible. (Grade 2C)
We recommend pharmacological thromboprophy￾laxis within 24 h after bleeding has been controlled.
(Grade 1B)
We do not recommend the routine use of inferior
vena cava filters as thromboprophylaxis. (Grade 1C)
Rationale
The risk of hospital-acquired venous thromboembolism
is high after multiple trauma, exceeding 50%; pulmonary
embolism is the third leading cause of death in those
who survive beyond the third day [519]. There are few
RCTs investigating thromboprophylaxis in trauma
patients, and the use of anti-embolic stockings has never
been evaluated in trauma patients. A meta-analysis was
unable to show any reduction in the rate of DVT with
intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) [520]; how￾ever, mechanical methods are widely used because of
the low bleeding risk.
The same meta-analysis showed that low-dose unfractio￾nated heparin (LDUH) was no more effective than no
thromboprophylaxis [520]. A large RCT showed that low
molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was significantly more
efficacious than LDUH, with a relative risk reduction of
proximal DVT with LMWH of 58%, compared to 30% for
LDUH (P = 0.01) [521]. Moreover, LMWH was shown to
be significantly more efficacious than IPC, with a 1% rate
of proximal DVT or pulmonary embolism versus 3% for
IPC [522]. More recently, the Prophylaxis for Throm￾boembolism in Critical Care Trial showed more benefit
with LMWH when dalteparin was compared to unfractio￾nated heparin (UFH) in a critical care population; there
were similar rates of proximal DVT at about 5%, but the
rate of pulmonary embolism was significantly lower with
dalteparin (1.3% vs. 2.3% in the UFH group) and a 5% rate
of major bleeding [523].
Side effects associated with the use of heparin include
heparin-induced thrombocytopenic thrombosis. This
effect is seen more frequently with UFH than LMWH.
The severity of trauma has been associated with the risk
of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia; therefore, the
greater the risk, the greater the importance of monitor￾ing platelet counts in trauma patients [524]. In sum￾mary, the use of heparin once haemostasis has been
achieved is the most efficacious option for trauma
patients. In those with a bleeding risk, mechanical meth￾ods are preferable. Due to the varied results from trials
comparing UFH with LMWH, we do not recommend
one over the other. Because LMWHs are mainly
excreted renally, unlike UFH, which is excreted through
the liver as well, there is risk of accumulation in patients
with renal failure; therefore, dose adjustments and/or
monitoring should be performed with LMWH according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Contraindications to pharmacological thromboprophy￾laxis include patients already receiving full-dose anticoa￾gulation, those with significant thrombocytopenia
(platelet count <50 × 109
/l), an untreated inherited or
acquired bleeding disorder, evidence of active bleeding,
uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure >230/120), a
lumbar puncture/spinal analgesia expected within the
next 12 h or performed within the last 4 h (24 h if trau￾matic), procedures with a high bleeding risk or a new
haemorrhagic stroke.
The use of prophylactic inferior vena cava filters is com￾mon; however, no evidence of added benefit when used in
combination with pharmacological thromboprophylaxis
exists. Pulmonary embolisms still occur despite the pre￾sence of a filter, and filters have short and long-term
Spahn et al. Critical Care 2013, 17:R76
http://ccforum.com/content/17/2/R76
Page 26 of 45

complication rates, are associated with high cost and often
provide a false sense of security, delaying the use of effec￾tive pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. Furthermore,
inferior vena cava filters require a second invasive proce￾dure to remove them.
The optimal timing for the initiation of pharmacologi￾cal thromboprophylaxis is often difficult to judge. Data
from 175,000 critical care admissions showed that the
risk of mortality was higher in those who did not receive
thromboprophylaxis during the first 24 h [525]. This
reflects the concern that those who bleed have a higher
rate of venous thromboembolism than those who do
not [526].
VI. Treatment pathway
Treatment algorithm
Recommendation 35 We recommend that each insti￾tution implement an evidence-based treatment algo￾rithm for the bleeding trauma patient. (Grade 1C)
Checklists
Recommendation 36 We recommend that treatment
checklists be used to guide clinical management.
(Grade 1B)
Quality management
Recommendation 37 We recommend that each insti￾tution include an assessment of adherence to the
institutional algorithm in routine quality manage￾ment. (Grade 1C)
Rationale
The development of a multi-disciplinary evidence-based
treatment algorithm for the bleeding trauma patient
offers a unique opportunity to create awareness among
all involved medical specialities and to improve mutual
understanding. The treatment algorithm allows, within
the framework of the available evidence, flexibility to
accommodate local pre-hospital rescue conditions, locally
available diagnostic and therapeutic options and improves
the consistency of care. Numerous examples demonstrate
the value of a treatment algorithm in improving the care
of trauma patients; some also resulted in cost savings
[527,528]. Conversely, deviation from treatment pathways
increases morbidity and mortality in trauma patients, with
a three-fold increased mortality in the subgroup of major
deviations [529].
The implementation of our recommendations and
adherence to a local treatment algorithm is facilitated by
a checklist analogous to the Safe Surgery Initiative [530].
Suggested items that should be included in such a
checklist are summarised in Table 4. Trauma treatment
training should be an integral part of the implementa￾tion of the algorithm.
In addition, adherence to the institutional treatment
algorithm should be included as part of routine institu￾tional quality management. Most institutions have
established a quality improvement program to assist
clinical teams in evaluating their own performance. An
audit of adherence to best practice, including feedback
and practice change where needed should be included
as part of the local implementation of these guidelines.
In order to evaluate the quality of care provided to the
patient who is bleeding after major trauma, we suggest
that the following quality standards be used:
â€¢ Time from injury to the initiation of intervention
to stop bleeding (surgery or embolisation) in hypoten￾sive patients who do not respond to initial resuscitation.
â€¢ Time from hospital arrival to availability of a full
set of blood results (full blood count, PT, fibrinogen,
calcium, viscoelastic testing (if available)).
â€¢ Proportion of patients receiving TXA before leav￾ing the emergency room.
â€¢ Time from hospital arrival to CT scan in bleeding
patients without an obvious source of hemorrhage.
â€¢ Damage control surgical techniques are used in
accordance with Recommendation 21.
â€¢ Thromboprophylaxis commenced in accordance
with Recommendation 34.
Extended post-discharge follow-up times may be
required to provide longer-term outcome data, because
an increasing percentage of trauma mortality occurs
after hospital discharge [531,532]. Approximately 50% of
mortality among trauma patients older than 65 years of
age occurs between 30 days and 6 months after injury
[532].
Discussion
This guideline for the management of the bleeding
trauma patient is based on a critical appraisal of the pub￾lished literature, a re-appraisal of the recommendations
we published three years ago and a consideration of cur￾rent clinical practice in areas in which randomised clini￾cal trials may never be performed for practical or ethical
reasons. In the process of generating this updated version
of the guideline, we identified a number of scientific
questions that have emerged or were not addressed pre￾viously and have developed recommendations to cover
these issues. The new and revised recommendations
included here reflect newly available evidence, shifts in
patient profiles and the consequent adaptation of general
clinical practice.
All of the recommendations presented here were for￾mulated according to a consensus reached by the author
group and the professional societies involved. Figure 2
and Figure 3 graphically summarise the recommenda￾tions included in this guideline. We have employed the
GRADE [24] hierarchy or evidence to formulate each
recommendation because it allows strong recommenda￾tions to be supported by weak clinical evidence in areas
in which the ideal randomised controlled clinical trials
Spahn et al. Critical Care 2013, 17:R76
http://ccforum.com/content/17/2/R76
Page 27 of 45

may never be performed. To minimise the bias intro￾duced by individual experts, we employed a nominal
group process to develop each recommendation and
several rounds of review and discussion to reach an
agreement on the questions to be considered and to
reach a final consensus on each recommendation. To
ensure that the process included input from all of the
relevant specialties, the group comprised a multidisci￾plinary pan-European group of experts, including the
active involvement of representatives from five of the
most relevant European professional societies.
This version of the guideline includes a new section on
the appropriate use of vasopressors and inotropic agents
and reflects an awareness of the growing number of
patients in the population at large treated with antiplatelet
agents and/or oral anticoagulants. As the elderly popula￾tion grows, clinical practice must adapt to provide optimal
care for patients with inherent thromboembolic risk
profiles and simultaneously accommodate possible pre￾treatment with preventative medications. We continue to
concur that both children and elderly adults who have not
been pre-treated with anticoagulant or antiplatelet agents
should generally be managed in the same manner as the
normal adult patient. The current guideline also includes
recommendations and a discussion of thromboprophylac￾tic strategies for all patients following traumatic injury.
The most significant addition to this version of the
guideline is a new section that discusses the need for every
institution to develop, implement and adhere to an evi￾dence-based clinical protocol to manage traumatically
injured patients. The author group feels strongly that a
comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to trauma care
and mechanisms with which to ensure that established
protocols are consistently implemented will ensure a uni￾form and high standard of care across Europe and beyond.
This guideline is a central feature of the STOP the Bleed￾ing Campaign, which aims to reduce the number of
patients who die within 24 h after arrival in hospital due
to exsanguination by at least 20% within five years. In
order to achieve this goal, educational, implementation
and compliance control steps must be taken by each insti￾tution. These guidelines serve as part of an educational
strategy; however, educational steps alone often fail to
translate new research results into clinical practice, as has
been shown with the introduction of protective lung venti￾lation [533,534]. One tool with which institutions could
measure and compare individual performance and assess
the effectiveness of overall treatment would be the

may not be administered routinely in 
the bleeding trauma patient.

R32
Novel anticoagulants
***
Damage control surgery should be 
employed in the severely injured 
patient presenting with deep 
hemorrhagic shock, signs of ongoing 
bleeding and coagulopathy. Severe 
coagulopathy, hypothermia, 
acidosis, inaccessible major 
anatomic injury, a need for time￾consuming procedures or 
concomitant major injury outside the 
abdomen should also trigger a 
damage control approach. Primary 
definitive surgical management 
R26
Plasma
***
Plasma or fibrinogen should be 
administered initially in patients with 
massive bleeding. If further plasma 
is administered, an optimal 
plasma:red blood cell ratio may be at 
least 1:2. Plasma transfusion should 
be avoided in patients without 
substantial bleeding
Prothrombin complex concentrate 
(PCC) should be used early for the 
emergency reversal of vitamin K￾dependent oral anticoagulants. 
PCC may be administered in the 
bleeding patient with 
thromboelastometric evidence of 
delayed coagulation initiation if a 
concentrate-based goal-directed 
strategy is applied.

Temperature management
***
transfusion. R15
Vasopressors and inotropic 
agents
***
Vasopressors may be administered 
to maintain target arterial pressure in 
the absence of a response to fluid 
therapy and inotropic agents may be 
infused in the presence of 
myocardial dysfunction. 
Novel anticoagulants
***
Substrate-specific anti-factor Xa 
activity may be measured in 
patients treated or suspected of 
being treated with oral anti-factor 
Xa agents such as rivaroxaban, 
apixaban or endoxaban. Reversal 
may be achieved with high-dose 
(25-50 U/kg) PCC if bleeding is life￾threatening. PCC may not be 
administered in patients treated or 
suspected of being treated with oral 
direct thrombin inhibitors such as 
g g
should be employed in the 
haemodynamically stable patient in 
the absence of any of these factors.
R27
Fibrinogen & cryoprecipitate
***
Fibrinogen concentrate or 
cryoprecipitate should be 
administered if significant bleeding is 
accompanied by 
thromboelastometric signs of a 
functional fibrinogen deficit or a 
plasma fibrinogen level of less than
substantial bleeding. Early application of measures to 
reduce heat loss and warm the 
hypothermic patient should be 
employed to achieve and maintain 
normothermia. Hypothermia at 33-
35ºC for 48 h may be applied in 
patients with traumatic brain injury 
once bleeding from other sources 
has been controlled.
R17
Erythrocytes
***
R22
Local haemostatic measures
***
Topical haemostatic agents should 
be employed in combination with 
other surgical measures or with 
packing for venous or moderate 
arterial bleeding associated with dabigatran. plasma fibrinogen level of less than
1.5-2.0 g/l; an initial fibrinogen dose 
of 3-4 g or 50 mg/kg of 
cryoprecipitate, approximately 
equivalent to 15-20 single donor 
units in a 70 kg adult, may be 
employed. Repeat doses may be 
guided by viscoelastic monitoring 
and laboratory assessment of 
fibrinogen levels.
R33
Recombinant activated 
coagulation 
factor VII
***
Treatment with recombinant 
activated coagulation factor VIIa 
(rFVIIa) may be considered if major 
bleeding and traumatic 
coagulopathy persist despite 
standard attempts to control

parenchymal injuries.
R28
Platelets
bleeding and best-practice use of
conventional haemostatic 
measures. rFVIIa may not be used 
in patients with intracranial 
haemorrhage caused by isolated 
head trauma.
***
Platelets should be administered to 
maintain a platelet count above 
50㽢109/l. A platelet count above 
100㽢109/l in patients with ongoing 
bleeding and/or traumatic brain 
injury may be maintained. An initial 
dose of 4-8 platelet concentrates or 
one aphaeresis pack may be used. R34
Thromboprophylaxis
***
Mechanical thromboprophylaxis 
with intermittent pneumatic 
compression and/or anti-embolic 
stockings may be applied as soon 
as possible. Pharmacological 
thromboprophylaxis should be 
employed within 24 h after bleeding 
has been controlled. Inferior vena 
cava filters as thromboprophylaxis 
should not be routinely employed.

circumstances. As new evidence becomes available, both
these clinical practice guidelines and local protocols will
need to evolve accordingly.
Key messages
• Coagulation monitoring and measures to support
coagulation should be implemented as early as possible
following traumatic injury and used to guide haemo￾static therapy.
• A damage control approach to surgical procedures
should guide patient management, including closure and
stabilisation of pelvic ring disruptions, packing, emboli￾sation and local haemostatic measures.
• This guideline reviews appropriate physiological tar￾gets and suggested use and dosing of fluids, blood pro￾ducts and pharmacological agents in the bleeding
trauma patient.
• The growing number of older patients requires spe￾cial attention to appropriately manage the inherent
thromboembolic risk profiles and possible pre-treatment
with antiplatelet agents and/or oral anticoagulants.
• A multidisciplinary approach to the management of the
traumatically injured patient remains the cornerstone of
optimal patient care, and each institution needs to develop,
implement and adhere to an evidence-based management
protocol that has been adapted to local circumstances.
