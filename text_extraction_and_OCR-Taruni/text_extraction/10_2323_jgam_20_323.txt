An enzyme which lysed viable yeast cells was purified about 75-fold 
from the culture fluid of Arthrobacter luteus by procedures including 
salting out with ammonium sulfate and Biogel CM-100 column chromato￾graphy. The purified enzyme appeared homogeneous on electro￾phoresis and ultracentrifugation, and had a molecular weight of about 
21,000. This enzyme lysed viable yeast cells in the absence of any other 
enzymes or additives and was tentatively named zymolyase. 
The optimum pH for lysis of viable yeast cells was 7.0-7.5, the optimum 
temperature was 35°, and the enzyme was relatively stable at pH 5-11. 
About 70 % of its activity was lost on incubation at 50° for 5 min, and 
all its activity was lost on incubation at 60° for 5 min. 
Studies on the hydrolyses of j3-1,3-glucans, i.e., yeast glucan, pachyman, 
curdlan, laminarin, and laminaran, showed that zymolyase is an endo￾jS-1,3-glucanase, which specifically releases laminaripentaose as the 
minimum product unit. 1-lowever, it behaves like an exo-enzyme in 
hydrolysis of high molecular jS-1,3-glucan, which shows strong molecular 
aggregation like yeast glucan, releasing laminaripentaose units. Zymo￾lyase shows much more affinity for insoluble glucan than for soluble 
glucan.
 Previously we reported that the culture broth of a strain of Arthrobacter 
luteus accumulated lytic activity for viable yeast cells only when the culture medium 
contained j3-1,3-glucan, and that the pattern of accumulation of this activity was 
quite different from that of -1,3-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.6) (1). These differences 
 323

suggested that some essential factors, other than fi-1,3-glucanase, might be in￾volved in the lyses of viable yeast cells. 
 This paper describes the purification, properties, and mode of action of an 
enzyme of Arthrobacter luteus, which lyses viable yeast cells but differs from fl-1, 
3-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.6).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
 Strain, medium, cultivation and crude preparation of the yeast-lytic enzyme. 
Arthrobacter luteus B 111-1 was cultivated in dried yeast medium (dried yeast 
2 %, yeast extract 0.2 %, NH4NO3 0.2 %, K2HPO4 0.1 %, MgSO4.7H2O 0.1 %, and 
Fe2(S04)3 • xH2O 0.01 %, pH 10) at 30° for 24 hr with aeration. The culture 
broth was centrifuged at 8,000 rpm for 10 min. The crude enzyme preparation 
was obtained from the supernatant by the same method as described in a previous 
report (1). 
 fl-1,3-Glucanase. Endo-fl- 1 ,3-glucanase was prepared by gel filtration on 
Sephadex G-50 from Glucanase G-4, kindly provided by Dr. Y. Takagi, Amano 
Seiyaku Co., Ltd. 
 Carbohydrates. Yeast glucan was prepared from brewery yeast by the method 
of PEAT et al. (2). Pachyman was prepared from Poria cocos as follows : The 
powdered fungus was added to 0.1 N NaOH solution to 0.5 % concentration, the 
mixture was stirred for 30 min at room temperature, and then filtered. Pachyman 
was precipitated from the filtrate by neutralization with 0.2 N HCI. After being 
washed twice with water, the precipitate was dissolved in 0.1 N NaOH solution 
and centrifuged. Pachyman was reprecipitated from the supernatant by neu￾tralization with 0.2 N HCI, repeatedly washed with water, ethanol, and ether, and 
dried. Heat-treated pachyman was prepared as follows : An aqueous suspen￾sion of 0.25% pachyman was incubated in a boiling water bath for 15 min, cooled 
by running water, and then centrifuged. The precipitate was washed with water, 
ethanol, and ehter, and dried. 
 Acid-treated pachyman was prepared as follows : A suspension of 1 
pachyman in 0.01 N HCl was autoclaved at 120° for 15 min and then centrifuged. 
The precipitate was washed several times with water to remove HC1 and then with 
ethanol and ether, and dried. Curdlan (3) was a gift from Professor T. Harada, 
Osaka University. Heat-treated curdlan was prepared by the same method as 
heat-treated pachyman. DMSO-treated curdlan was obtained as follows : Curd￾lan was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and filtered. The filtrate was 
added to an equal volume of water and the mixture was stood overnight at room 
temperature. The resulting precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed 
with water to remove DMSO, ethanol and ether, and dried. Cold water-insolu￾ble laminarin from Laminaria hyperborea was purchased from Tokyo Kasei Kogyo 
Co., Ltd., and recrystallized from water. Reduced laminarin was prepared as

1974 Lysis of Yeast Cells 325
follows : An aqueous solution of 4 % laminarin was mixed with an adequate 
amount of sodium borohydride powder. The solution was stood overnight at 
room temperature, and then acetic acid was added to remove excess amount of 
sodium borohydride, followed by dialysis against tap water for 4 days. The pre￾cipitated material was collected by centrifugation. An aqueous suspension of the 
precipitate was washed with water, ethanol and ether, and dried. Laminaran 
from Eisenia bicyclis (4) was a gift from Dr. M. Maeda, Saitama University. 
Laminaridextrins (oligosaccharides with ,3-1,3-glucosidic linkages) were prepared 
from pachyman by the method of WHEALAN (S). Laminaribiose was a gift from 
Dr. K. Matsuda, Tohoku University. 
 Determination of lytic activity on viable yeast cells. Viable cells of brewery 
yeast in the resting stage were used as substrate. A mixture of 1 ml of enzyme 
solution, 3 ml of yeast cell suspension (2 mg dry wt./ml), 5 ml of M/15 phosphate 
buffer (pH 7.5), and 1 ml of water was incubated at 25° for 2 hr with gentle shak￾ing. Then the optical density of the mixture was determined at 800 nm (OD800). 
The reference cell contained the same mixture but with 1 ml of water instead of 
the enzyme solution. The percentage decrease in optical density was calculated 
from the following equation: 
 Percentage decrease =(0D800 of reference--0D800 of reaction mixture) 
 x100/initial 0D800 of reference 
Purification of the enzyme was followed by calculating the percentage decrease in 
OD800 per volume of enzyme solution used. One unit of the enzyme activity is 
defined as the amount causing 30 % decrease in optical density per 2 hr. As the 
percentage decrease in 0D800 increased approximately in proportion to the enzyme 
concentration within a range of 0-60%, the enzyme solution showing high lytic 
activity was diluted to the range cited above for determination of enzymic activity. 
 Determination of S-1,3-glucanase activity. -1,3-Glucanase activity was 
assayed as described in a previous report (1). 
 Estimation of protein. Protein was determined by the method of LOWRY et 
al. (6) using egg albumin as a standard. 
 Estimation of total and soluble carbohydrates. Total and soluble carbo￾hydrates were determined by the phenol-H2SO4 method (7) using glucose as a 
standard. 
 Estimation of reducing power of carbohydrates. Reducing power was deter￾mined by the method of SOMOGYi (8) or of PARK and JOHNSON (9) using glucose 
as a standard. Oligosaccharides seemed to show no detectable reducing activity 
by the Somogyi method and they gave too high a value for reducing power using 
the Park-Johnson method because j3-1,3-glucosidic linkages decomposed. There￾fore, reducing power was also estimated by a modification of the ferricyanide 
method of Park and Johnson. The original method was modified by replacing 
carbonate-cyanide solution by carbonate solution (without adding KCN), increas-

326 KITAMURA, KANEKO, and YAMAMOTO VOL. 20
ing the incubation time to 20 min and using laminaribiose as a standard. The 
degree of polymerization (total carbohydrate/reducing power) of laminaribiose 
was estimated as 1.4 by the original method and 2.0 by the modified method, that 
of laminaripentaose was estimated as 1.8 and 4.2, and that of laminarin from 
Laminaria as 5.0 and 20.0, respectively. Accuracy in the determination of the 
degree of polymerization was greater using the modified method. However, a 
few of the 13-1,3-glucosidic linkages seemed to be decomposed even by the modi￾fied method. 
 Paper chromatography of sugars. Paper chromatography was performed on 
Whatman No. 1 paper by the ascending method with a solvent system consisting 
of butanol, pyridine, and water (6: 4: 3, v/v). Materials were developed three 
times. Sugars on the chromatograms were detected with benzidine-trichloro￾acetic acid reagent. 
 Gel filtration of sugars. Gel filtration of sugars was performed on a column 
(2 x 150 cm) of Sephadex G-25. Samples were eluted with water and the effluent 
was collected in 5 ml fractions. Void volume of the column was 175 ml and 
hexa-, penta-, tetra-, di-, and mono-saccharide were eluted at 260, 270, 280, 315, 
and 335 ml, respectively.
RESULTS
Fractionation of lytic activity for viable yeast cells 
 Fractionation on CM cellulose. A solution of 3.2 g of the crude enzyme 
powder in 50 ml of deionized water was dialyzed overnight against 0.01 M phos￾phate buffer (pH 6.0) and centrifuged. The supernatant (ca. 45 ml) was applied 
to a column (3 x 29 cm) of CM-cellulose buffered with 0.01 M phosphate buffer 
(pH 6.0). The column was washed with the same buffer and eluted first with 690 ml 
of 0.01 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and then 'with 400 ml of the same buffer con￾taining 0.1 M NaCI. Each fraction (10 ml) of the eluate was used for the meas￾urement of the absorbance at 280 nm, j3-1,3-glucanase activity, and the lytic activ￾ity. The elution pattern is shown in Fig. 1. Most of the j3-1,3-glucanase activity 
was not adsorbed on the CM-cellulose, and the adsorbed glucanase was eluted 
with the buffer of pH 7.5. The lytic activity was recovered in three peaks. A 
minor peak of lytic activity, observed in unadsorbed fractions, seemed to be due 
to j3-1,3-glucanase. The middle peak, eluted with buffer of pH 7.5, was probably 
a combination of adsorbed 0-1,3-glucanase and a little of the lytic enzyme. The 
major peak of lytic activity, eluted with the buffer containing 0.1 M NaCI, seemed 
to be due to a lytic enzyme which differed from jS-1,3-glucanase. 
 A major part of the lytic activity was separated form most of the x-1,3-gluca￾nase activity by CM-cellulose chromatography, but complete separation from 
the adsorbed 0-1,3-glucanase was not achieved.

powder in 100 ml of 0.01 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) was dialyzed overnight 
against the same buffer and centrifuged. The supernatant was applied to a column 
(3 x 30 cm) of Biogel CM-100 buffered with 0.01 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.0). 
The column was washed with the same buffer. 9-1,3-Glucanase was not adsorbed 
on the column, and the enzyme adsorbed was eluted with 0.01 M phosphate buffer, 
pH 7.5. This elution pattern is shown in Fig. 2. The unadsorbed materials 
showed a very low lytic activity. 
 As shown in Fig. 2, elution profile of the protein peak almost coincided with 
that of the lytic activity and /3-1,3-glucanase activity was not detected in these 
elutions. Rechromatography of a mixture of fractions 80-85 (Fig. 2) gave a 
sharp peak of lytic activity agreeing with a single peak of absorbance at 280 nm 
without any shoulder.
Purlcation of the lytic enzyme 
 The lytic enzyme was purified from the culture broth of Arthrobacter luteus 
B 111-1 on Biogel CM-100. The process of purification and changes in specific 
activity during the process are shown in Fig. 3 and Table 1, respectively. 
 48-1,3-Glucanase activity was not detected in the final preparation. This 
procedure gave 75-fold purification over the culture fluid, with a recovery of about 
7 %. The enzyme appeared homogeneous on electrophoresis in a Tiselius ap￾paratus (Fig. 4) and gave only one peak on ultracentrifugation for 100 min at 
60,000 rpm (Fig. 5). From the ultracentrifugal analysis, sedimentation constant 
and the molecular weight of the enzyme were calculated as 2.43 S and about 21,000, 
respectively.

 One milligram of the purified enzyme (as protein) completely lysed about 
700 mg dry weight of viable brewery yeast cells in 2 hr at 25°. This enzyme was 
effective alone in lysing viable yeast cells and was tentatively named zymolyase.
Properties of zymolyase 
 Optimum pH. As shown in Fig. 6, the optimum pH for lysis of viable yeast 
cells was 7.0-7.5. 
 pH stability. As shown in Fig. 7, zymolyase was relatively stable at pH 5-11. 
 Optimum temperature. As shown in Fig. 8, the optimum temperature for 
lysis of viable yeast cells was 35°. 
 Heat stability. As shown in Table 2, zymolyase lost about 70% of its activity 
on incubation at 50° for 5 min, and all its activity on incubation at 60° for 5 min.

Mode of action of zymolyase 
 Lysis of viable cells of brewery yeast. Zymolyase lysed viable yeast cells, 
decreasing the turbidity (0D800) of the reaction mixture (Fig. 9). The turbidity 
decreased rapidly at first and became approximately constant after incubation 
for 60 min. Decrease in the turbidity was accompanied by increase in 0D280 of

lysis of the yeast cells. After incubation for 60 min, intact cells could hardly be 
found microscopically in the reaction mixture. 
 Degradation of yeast glucan. Yeast glucan was hydrolyzed by zymolyase 
with release of soluble carbohydrate and reducing power (Fig. 10). Soluble carbo￾hydrate increased rapidly with time and became approximately constant after 
incubation for 20 min. The patterns of release of soluble carbohydrate and re￾ducing power, measured by Park-Johnson's method, were similar. Scarcely any 
release of reducing power was detected by Somogyi's method. 
 The soluble product from yeast glucan was submitted to paper chromato￾graphy. As shown in Fig. 11, two spots were obtained, one with the same mo￾bility as laminaripentaose and the other remaining at the origin. These two prod￾ucts were also separated by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column (Fig. 12). 
The two peaks (I and II) on the chromatogram corresponded to the two spots on

that of laminaripentaose. A mixture of 25 mg of the low molecular product 
(peak II), 2.5 ml of M/15 phosphate buffer (pH 5.8), and 5 ml of 18-1,3-glucanase 
solution (140 units/ml) was incubated at 40° for 3 hr. Then the mixture was 
concentrated at room temperature and applied to Sephadex G-25 column (Fig. 
13). Two peaks corresponding to di- and mono-saccharide were obtained on 
the chromatogram. Peaks 1 and 2 were identified as laminaribiose and glucose, 
respectively, by paper chromatography. From these results, the lower molecular 
weight sugar in the soluble product from yeast glucan was deduced to be laminari￾pentaose.

 A suspension of 5 ml of pachyman (2.5 mg/ml) was incubated in a boiling water 
bath for various periods and then cooled and adjusted to 10 ml. A mixture of 1 ml of 
zymolyase solution (50 µg protein/ml), 4 ml of each pachyman suspension, and 5 ml of 
M/15 phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) was incubated at 25° for 30 min. The reaction was stop￾ped by placing the mixture in a boiling water bath for 3 min. The mixture was filtered 
and the total carbohydrate content in the filtrate was determined.

25°, no soluble carbohydrate was released. However, when pachyman had been 
incubated in a boiling water bath for 5 min, it could be hydrolyzed by zymolyase 
with release of soluble carbohydrate (Table 3). When temperature of a suspen￾sion of pachyman reached about 60°, the suspension dipped in a boiling water 
bath became clear and then turbid again. When the suspension was cooled at

the time when it was clear, a gel-like precipitate formed and on incubation of this 
precipitate with zymolyase some amount of soluble carbohydrate was released. 
 The soluble product from heat-treated pachyman was applied to a Sephadex 
G-25 column (Fig. 14). Only one peak of laminaripentaose was observed with 
no peak corresponding to a high molecular product of yeast glucan, glucose, or 
oligosaccharides having lower molecular weights than laminaripentaose; that is, 
zymolyase hydrolyzed heat-treated pachyman releasing laminaripentaose only. 
 The optimum pH and temperature of zymolyase for hydrolysis of heat-treated 
pachyman and yeast glucan were pH 6.5 and 45°, respectively. 
 The time course of hydrolysis of heat-treated pachyman is shown in Fig. 15. 
Reducing power was determined by the modification of Park-Johnson's method. 
Soluble carbohydrate and reducing power increased with time. The ratio of 
total carbohydrate as glucose to reducing power as laminaribiose was 2.1 through￾out the reaction period. The degree of polymerization of the product was cal￾culated as 4.2, which is in good accordance with that of laminaripentaose. The 
products released at intervals during the reaction were submitted to paper chro￾matography but the only product detected was laminaripentaose. 
 Heat-treated pachyman was not completely solubilized by zymolyase and 
the degradation limit of heat-treated pachyman was examined. The reaction 
mixture contained 2 ml of heat-treated pachyman suspension (5 mg/ml), 2.5 ml 
of 0.05 M Tris-maleate-NaOH buffer (pH 6.5), and 0.5 ml of zymolyase solution 
(50 µg protein/ml). It was incubated at 45° for 120 min. Then the reaction 
mixture was placed in a boiling water bath for 5 min, cooled, supplemented with 
0.5 ml of zymolyase solution, and incubated further at 45° for 120 min (Fig. 16). 
The final percentage degradation of heat-treated pachyman was 70%. Insoluble 
materials in the reaction mixture were washed several times with water, dissolved 
in dilute NaOH solution, reprecipitated by neutralization with dilute HCl solu￾tion, and heated by the method used for pachyman. The final percentage de￾gradation of this materials by zymolyase was 50 %, and the insoluble residue treated 
in the same way showed 23 % final degradation by zymolyase. Insoluble materi￾als were finally obtained in about 12% yield based on the original heat-treated 
pachyman. 
 Acid-treated pachyman was more susceptible to zymolyase than heat-treated 
pachyman (Fig. 17). The soluble product was laminaripentaose as from heat￾treated pachyman. 
 The difference between the susceptibilities of pachyman, heat-treated pachy￾man, and acid-treated pachyman to zymolyase may be due to the difference in 
their degree of molecular aggregation, because differences were found in their 
sodium content; pachyman contained 1.42 % sodium (as determined by atomic 
absorption spectrophotometry), while heat- and acid-treated pachyman contained 
no detectable sodium, and in their X-ray diffraction patterns (Fig. 18). The X￾ray diffraction pattern of acid-treated pachyman was almost the same as that of

 Degradation of curdlan. As shown in Table 4, curdlan also became suscepti￾ble to zymolyase after heat treatment. Treatment with dimethyl sulfoxide slightly 
increased the susceptibility of curdlan. The soluble product from heat-treated 
curdlan was also laminaripentaose. 
 Degradation of laminarin and reduced laminarin. The hydrolyses of aaminarin 
and reduced laminarin by zymolyase were examined. The ratios of total carbo-

hydrate (as glucose) to reducing power (as laminaribiose) of laminarin and reduced 
laminarin were 10.2 and 1,560, respectively. That of reduced laminarin indicated 
that the reducing terminals of laminarin were almost completely reduced. 
 As shown in Fig. 19, reduced laminarin was more susceptible to zymolyase 
than laminarin. After incubation for 120 min, the reaction mixture was stood 
overnight at 2° and then centrifuged. The supernatant was applied to a Sephadex 
G-25 column. The elution patterns obtained were similar to each other. Lami￾naripentaose was one of the main products, and neither oligosaccharides lower 
than laminaripentaose nor glucose were released as in the case of heat-treated 
pachyman. However, the product differed from that of heat-treated pachyman 
in the presence of a large amount of oligosaccharides higher than laminaripentaose. 
These products were not residual chains derived from the substrate by exohydro￾lysis, judging from the reducing power of the oligosaccharides released from re￾duced laminarin (Fig. 20), that is, laminarin was hydrolyzed by zymolyase endo￾wise. 
 Degradation of laminaran from Eisenia. The action of zymolyase on lami￾naran was also examined. No reducing power was released and no peak cor￾responding to the hydrolysis product was observed in the elution pattern of the 
reaction mixture on gel filtration on Sephadex G-25. Thus, laminaran does not

 Km values with various substrates. The Km values of zymolyase for various 
substrate were estimated from the Lineweaver and Burk plots of the relation be￾tween the concentration of substrate and the enzyme activity. The Km value 
for laminarin from Laminaria was calculated from Henri's equation (10) by deter￾mination of the increase of reducing power during the enzymic reaction, because, 
unavoidably, a high concentration of the substrate had to be used. 
 In order to obtain the Km values for insoluble glucans, reaction rate was 
determined as follows : A mixture of 2 ml of the substrate suspension (of vari￾ous concentrations), 2.5 ml of 0.05 M Tris-maleate-NaOH buffer (pH 6.5) and 
0.5 ml of zymolyase solution (2 µg protein/ml) was incubated at 45° for 10 min. 
The reaction was terminated by adding 1 ml of 1 N H2S04 and soluble carbohydrate 
was determined by the phenol-H2S04 method. In order to obtain the Km value 
for laminarin, increase of reducing power was determined as follows : A mixture 
of 2 ml of laminarin solution (26 mg as glucose/ml), 2.5 ml of 0.05 M Tris-maleate￾NaOH buffer (pH 6.5), and 0.5 ml of zymolyase solution (20 ,ug protein/ml) was 
incubated at 45° for various periods. The reaction was terminated by placing

the mixture in a boiling water bath for 3 min, and reducing power was determined 
by the modification of Park-Johnson's method. 
 The Km values for various substrates are given in Table 5. The Km values 
for yeast glucan and acid-treated pachyman were low, showing that zymolyase 
had a high affinity for these substrates. The Km value for laminarin was about 
50 times that for yeast glucan.
DISCUSSION
 The culture filtrate of Arthrobacter luteus, capable of lysing viable yeast cells, 
was also found to have an activity of 3-1,3-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.6), an enzyme 
thought to be mainly responsible for lysis of yeast cell walls (11-14). However, 
when the crude enzyme powder was subjected to CM-cellulose column chromato￾graphy, the lytic activity was eluted in fractions different from j3-1,3-glucanase. 
The lytic activity was purified from the culture fluid by chromatography on Biogel 
CM-100 and the lytic enzyme was tentatively named zymolyase. 5-1,3-Glucanase 
which was isolated here only lysed viable yeast cells slightly when added at an 
extremely high concentration (]Fig. 1). Thus zymolyase in culture fluid of A. 
luteus seems to play the essential role in lysis of viable yeast cells. The effects of 
temperature and pH on zymolyase were similar to those reported for the crude 
enzyme in the previous report (1). 
 Zymolyase hydrolyzed yeast glucan with release of soluble carbohydrate. 
This soluble product consisted mainly of two components. One was the saccha￾ride eluted at void volume from a column of Sephadex G-25, and the other was 
laminaripentaose. Glucose and oligosaccharides lower than laminaripentaose 
were not detected. These results suggest that zymolyase may be a type of 5-1, 
3-glucanase releasing laminaripentaose as the minimum product unit, because 
yeast glucan has been reported to be j3-1,3-glucan with a branched structure, con￾taining about 3 % of /3-1,6 interchain linkages (I5). 
 j3-1,3-Glucans such as pachyman and curdlan, which were hardly hydrolyzed 
by zymolyase, became susceptible to the enzyme after heat treatment. Heat￾treated p-1,3-glucan was hydrolyzed by zymolyase, releasing laminaripentaose as 
a sole soluble product, and even on only short incubation, only laminaripentaose 
was detected in the supernatant of the reaction mixture. From these results, it 
seems that zymolyase can catalyze exohydrolysis of heat-treated glucan, releasing 
laminaripentaose units. 
 Zymolyase also hydrolyzed laminarin from Laminaria. Gel filtration showed 
that laminaripentaose was one of the main products, and that neither lower oligo￾saccharides than laminaripentaose nor glucose was released. However, unlike 
heat-treated pachyman, a large amount of higher oligosaccharides was also de￾tected in the product. These higher oligosaccharides did not seem to be residual 
chains derived from the substrate by exohydrolysis because these oligosaccharides

342 KITAMURA, KANEKO, and YAMAMOTO VOL. 20
from reduced laminarin showed reducing power. Thus, zymolyase may catalyze 
endohydrolysis of laminarin. 
 Laminaran from Eisenia is reported to be a linear glucan with j3-1,3- and 
0-1,6-linkages in a ratio of 3:1(4). It was not hydrolyzed by zymolyase, suggest￾ing that long sequences of 3-1,3-linkages are specifically required for the action of 
zymolyase. 
 Pachyman and curdlan were considered to be a Q-1,3-glucan having a degree 
of polymerization of 255 and containing approximately four j3-1,6-glucosidic 
branch points besides one internal j3-1,6-glucosidic linkage, and to be a linear 
j3-1,3-glucan having a degree of polymerization of 455 and containing two internal 
~3-1,6-glucosidic linkage, respectively (16). Laminarin from Laminaria hyper￾borea used in this study was the so-called insoluble laminarin. This polysaccha￾ride was reported to have a degree of polymerization of 24 and to be a linear ,3-1, 
3-glucan with occasional 3-1,6-interchain linkages (17-19). From these results 
of investigation of the hydrolysis of these S-1.3-glucans, we are led to the conclu￾sion that zymolyase is a type of -1,3-glucanase. 
 Zymolyase is a jS-1,3-glucanase which hydrolyzes linear glucose polymers 
with j3-1,3-linkages, specifically releasing laminaripentaose as the minimum product 
unit. It has a specific requirement for long sequences of j3-1,3-linked glucose 
residues, and it may cause endo- or exo-hydrolysis depending mainly on the chain 
length or solubility of the substrate. Zymolyase has a much higher affinity for 
insoluble glucan (heat-treated pachyman, Km=0.04 %) than for soluble glucan 
(laminarin, Km =1.09 %), and it may have a very high specificity for a j3-1,3-glucan 
structure with firm molecular aggregation. 
 Pachyman became susceptible to zymolyase after heat treatment. Pachy￾man contains a considerable amount of sodium which is not removed by dialysis, 
so that it may have a complex molecular structure. On heat treatment, the gucan 
molecules may become rearranged with exclusion of sodium salt, because sodium 
was not detected in the heat-treated pachyman. The X-ray diffraction pattern of 
heat-treated glucan was similar to that of yeast glucan. Zymolyase has a high 
affinity for high molecular S-1,3-glucan and, in addition, it requires some form of 
crystallinity, like that in yeast glucan. On treatment with dimethyl sulfoxide, 
the molecules do not seem to become rearranged in the same way as on heat 
treatment. 
 Heat-treated pachyman was not completely solubilized by zymolyase. The 
insoluble residue was solubilized by the enzyme only after formation of a complex 
with a salt and heat treatment. The nature of the structure in heat-treated pachy￾man, which is resistant to zymolyase, is unknown. It may be a structure like 
that of laminarin from Laminaria. Acid-treated pachyman showed an X-ray dif￾fraction pattern similar to that of yeast glucan. About 90% of acid-treated pachy￾man was solubilized by zymolyase and the Km value for acid-treated pachyman 
was very similar to that for yeast glucan. The change in the structure of pachy-

man during acid treatment requires study, since studies on acid-treated pachyman 
should provide information on the structure of yeast glucan. 
 VILLANUEVA et al. (20, 21) reported that an endo-j3-1,3-glucanase purified 
from the culture fluid of Micromonospora chalcea lysed the cell walls of viable 
yeast, but their enzyme seems to differ from zymolyase, and is probably a normal 
j3-1,3-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.6). BULL and CHESTERS (22) reported that the C and 
D components of laminarinases from Myrothecium verrucaria and Rhizopus 
nodosus hydrolyzed laminarin, releasing only oligosaccharides with degrees of 
polymerization of more than 5. Zymolyase seems to resemble these enzymes, 
but it was not reported whether the C and D components could lyse the cell walls 
of viable yeast. A lytic j3-1,3-glucanase from Cytophaga johnsonii, described by 
BACON et al. (23), showed very slight activity with curdlan prepared by solubili￾zation in alkali and reprecipitation with acid. However, it solubilized heat￾treated curdlan, releasing appreciable amounts of material with a degree of poly￾merization of about 5-6, and also a small amount of lower oligosaccharide and 
traces of glucose. Recently, DOI et al. (24, 25) reported that glucanase I from a 
strain of Arthrobacter lysed viable yeast cells, liberating predominantly laminari￾pentaose from various j3- 1 ,3-glucans, cutting out laminaripentaose from the 
interior of chains of 8-1,3-linked glucose units. Their enzyme seems to resemble 
the lytic -1,3-glucanase described by BACON et al. (23). It is interesting that 
almost all the enzymes, which are reported to lyse viable yeast cell walls, also 
hydrolyze j3-1,3-glucan releasing oligosaccharide with a degree of polymerization 
of about 5-6 as the main product. 
 The mechanism of lyses of viable yeast cell walls by zymolyase remains to be 
elucidated. However, if the above conclusions are correct, the enzyme requires 
some crystallinity of molecules, consisting of long sequences of 3-1,3-linked glucose 
residues. As zymolyase lyses viable yeast cells, such structures are exposed on 
the cell walls of viable brewery yeast and zymolyase may specifically decomposes 
them by exohydrolysis. Furthermore viable yeast cell walls are solubilized by 
zymolyase which is a j3-1,3-glucanase, so that the ~3-1,3-glucan structure may be 
essential for the solidity or rigidity of the walls. Hydrolysis of -1,3-glucan link￾ages would presumably lead to solubilization of residual ~3-1,6-glucan chains (or 
those with short sequences of j3-1,3-linkages), causing dissolution of mannan and 
protein trapped by the j3-glucan net work.
