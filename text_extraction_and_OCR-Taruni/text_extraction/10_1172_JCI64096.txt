of immune system aging

The effects of aging on the immune system are manifest at multiple levels that include reduced production of B and 
T cells in bone marrow and thymus and diminished function of mature lymphocytes in secondary lymphoid tissues. 
As a result, elderly individuals do not respond to immune challenge as robustly as the young. An important goal 
of aging research is to define the cellular changes that occur in the immune system and the molecular events that 
underlie them. Considerable progress has been made in this regard, and this information has provided the rationale 
for clinical trials to rejuvenate the aging immune system.
Introduction
One of the most recognized consequences of aging is a decline 
in immune function. While elderly individuals are by no means 
immunodeficient, they often do not respond efficiently to 
novel or previously encountered antigens. This is illustrated by 
increased vulnerability of individuals 70 years of age and older 
to influenza (1), a situation that is exacerbated by their poor 
response to vaccination (2–4).
The effects of aging on the immune system are widespread and 
affect the rate at which naive B and T cells are produced as well 
as the composition and quality of the mature lymphocyte pool. 
The goal of this article is to review recent advances, with a focus 
on adaptive immunity, in the understanding of the cellular and 
molecular events underlying these age-induced alterations and 
discuss their implications for the design of strategies to rejuvenate 
the immune system in the elderly.
Effects of aging on immune system development
Following their production in the bone marrow and thymus, naive 
B and T cells migrate to secondary lymphoid tissues such as the 
spleen (5–7). This process is particularly robust in the young in 
order to generate a diverse immune repertoire and to fill periph￾eral lymphoid compartments. In contrast, primary lymphopoiesis 
in the elderly is significantly diminished, as exemplified by involu￾tion of the thymus (8–10). The causes of this age-related reduc￾tion in lymphocyte development are multifactorial and include 
changes in HSCs and progenitor cells (11, 12) as well as the local 
tissue and systemic environments (13, 14).
HSCs exhibit multiple age-related changes that include impaired 
adherence to stromal cells and, in some strains of mice (15, 16) and 
elderly humans (17), an increase in number. From an immunologic 
perspective, the most profound effect of stem cell aging in both mice 
(11, 18) and humans (17) is a decreased capacity to produce lym￾phocytes and an increase in myeloid potential. This shift has been 
correlated with increased expression of myeloid lineage genes and 
downregulation of those specifying a lymphoid lineage fate (11, 17).
The ability to identify, at least in mice, distinct HSC subsets that 
are lymphoid biased or myeloid biased, or that exhibit balanced 
lympho-myeloid potential has provided new insights into how 
aging affects the stem cell pool (Figure 1 and refs. 19, 20). Because 
each of these lineage-negative (Lin–) CD117+ (c-kit+) Sca-1+ popula￾tions can be defined based on their relative expression of CD150, 
a signaling lymphocytic activation molecule family member 
(Figure 1 and refs. 21–23), it is now appreciated that the number of 
lymphoid-biased stem cells declines with age concomitant with an 
increase in myeloid-biased HSCs (19). The age-related increase in 
expression of myeloid lineage genes in the studies noted above (11, 
17) likely resulted from the accumulation of myeloid-biased HSCs, 
as these analyses were performed on unseparated pools of HSCs. 
Despite the increase in their number, myeloid-biased stem cells are 
not as robust as their young counterparts (24), which in turn could 
underlie the numerous age-related deficiencies observed in mature 
myeloid cells such as neutrophils and macrophages (25, 26).
Lymphoid-biased HSCs in old mice also appear to accumulate 
deficiencies that, as discussed below, may compromise their self￾renewal potential and contribute to the decline of this population 
(27). In view of this, it is not surprising that the number of B cell 
(28–31) and T cell (32, 33) progenitors in bone marrow and thy￾mus is markedly reduced with age. In addition, the poor quality of 
the lymphoid progenitors that are generated in the aged further 
exacerbates the decline in lymphopoiesis (29, 32, 34). For example, 
common lymphoid progenitors, pre–pro-B cells, and pro-B cells 
from old mice do not proliferate as extensively as do young cells, 
and they exhibit significantly higher rates of apoptosis. The most 
immature intrathymic progenitors, which have been termed early 
T lineage progenitors (ETPs), generate CD4–CD8– double-negative 
(DN) progeny that ultimately become mature CD4+ Th cells and 
CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (35). Similar to B cell progenitors, ETPs and 
DN cells from old mice also exhibit age-related defects in prolifera￾tion and high rates of apoptosis (ref. 32 and Figure 1).
Why aging results in a decline in the number of lymphoid-biased 
HSCs and reduced quality of lymphoid progenitors is not fully 
understood. On the one hand, intrinsically programmed events in 
stem and progenitor cells may be operative, which would presume 
that these cells have some sort of internal clock that regulates their 
function and longevity. However, accumulating evidence suggests 
that declines in lymphopoiesis are influenced by age-related changes 
in the environment. The precise, age-related environmental factors 
that result in depletion of lymphoid-biased HSCs have not been 
identified, although changes in levels of transforming growth factor 
β-1 might be involved (21). Declines in the bone marrow microenvi￾ronment, possibly as a result of decreased IL-7 secretion by stromal 
cells, have been implicated in B cell lineage aging (36, 37). Age-relat￾Conflict of interest: The authors have declared that no conflict of interest exists.

ed microenvironmental changes also have a major impact in the thy￾mus, where T cell development is dependent upon an intact thymic 
milieu composed of fibroblasts, macrophages, dendritic cells, and 
thymic epithelial cells. It is clear that the number of thymic epi￾thelial cells declines over time and that they are not replaced, as a 
result of impaired proliferation (38). In addition, the production of 
inflammatory mediators that may be thymocytotoxic also increases 
with age (39). The thymus, particularly in humans, is increasingly 
infiltrated with adipocytes, the byproducts of which may be toxic to 
developing thymocytes and to the remaining stromal cell popula￾tions (40). A similar fatty deterioration of the bone marrow micro￾environment occurs (41), but the role of adipocyte-derived factors in 
suppression of B lymphopoiesis is not well understood.
Systemic changes that occur during aging may also affect lym￾phocyte production (14) and thymopoiesis in particular. For exam￾ple, numerous reports have demonstrated that growth hormone 
(GH) and IGF-1 can stimulate thymopoiesis (13, 42). Because the 
production of these hormones declines with age (43), this has led 
to the conclusion that age-related changes in the endocrine system 
contribute to declines in lymphopoiesis. This view has formed the 
rationale for clinical trials using GH, which we discuss below.
Aging and the decline of immune function
Although the number of naive B and T cells that migrate from pri￾mary to secondary lymphoid organs is reduced by aging, B and T 
cell development does not cease entirely. Indeed, some functional 
thymic tissue remains even in elderly humans (44). The contin￾ued production of lymphocytes, albeit limited, and the presence 
of relatively normal numbers of lymphocytes in organs such as the 
spleen raises the question of why functional immunity declines in 
the elderly. The answer is that the composition and quality of the 
mature lymphocyte pool is profoundly altered by aging.
For example, an increase in the number of memory T cells is now 
a well-recognized feature of aging. These cells, which are gener￾ated following the initial encounter with antigen, persist long after 
the initial challenge has cleared and provide a source of effectors 
that can respond rapidly upon antigen re-exposure. Exposure to 
multiple pathogens over time results in a diverse immune reper￾toire that includes an increased pool of protective memory cells. 
However, chronic stimulation with persistent viral infections such 
as CMV can exhaust the naive pool of cells and result in an oligo￾clonal memory cell expansion. This phenomenon is thought to be 
a major factor contributing to the accumulation of CD8+ memory 
Figure 1
Effects of aging on HSCs and lymphocyte progenitors. Lymphopoiesis in the young (left) is characterized by robust B and T cell production in the 
bone marrow and thymus. The pool of HSCs includes a relatively high number of lymphoid-biased stem cells that efficiently generate lymphoid 
progenitors with high proliferative potential. However, with increasing age (right), the number of lymphoid-biased HSCs declines and myeloid￾biased stem cells predominate, contributing to the reduced numbers of lymphoid progenitors. In addition, B cell progenitors in the bone marrow 
and T cell progenitors in the thymus exhibit reduced rates of proliferation and higher levels of apoptosis compared with their young counterparts. 
The increased expression of Ink4a and Arf in pro-B cells and Ink4a in ETPs contribute to this decreased proliferation/increased apoptosis. The 
decline in primary lymphopoiesis in turn results in a reduced number of naive cells that migrate to secondary lymphoid tissues such as the spleen.

cells in the elderly (45), although antigen-independent expansion 
of CD8+ T cells may also occur (46). These oligoclonal expanded 
CD8+ memory T cells are further distinguished in humans by loss 
of expression of the CD28 co-stimulatory molecule (47, 48) and 
impaired immune function. The accumulation of CD8+CD28– T 
cells and CMV seropositivity are components of the immune risk 
profile, which has been proposed as a predictor of mortality in 
individuals 65 and older (49), but precisely how the combination 
of these events results in increased death is not clear (50).
The immune risk profile also includes B cells with impaired 
function. B cell number in mice is unchanged by aging, but in 
human peripheral blood their absolute number is reduced (51). 
This decline is likely due to decreased numbers of IgM+ memory 
and switched memory B cells, because the total number of naive 
B cells remains unchanged by aging (51, 52). Human and murine 
B cells also exhibit impaired class switch recombination, which 
has been attributed to decreased induction of activation-induced 
cytidine deaminase (AID) enzyme (53). In view of the critical role 
played by CD4+ T cells in orchestrating the immune response, 
some of the age-related deficiencies observed in B cells (51, 53, 54), 
which include a reduction in the number of plasmablasts that 
develop in response to influenza vaccination (55) and the produc￾tion of poor-quality antibodies to carbohydrate antigens (56–58), 
may occur secondary to T cell deficiencies.
Multiple B cell subpopulations have been defined, and addition￾al study is required to determine how aging affects them. Thus, 
humoral immunity to influenza virus occurs in T cell–indepen￾dent and T cell–dependent waves that may involve B1, marginal 
zone, and follicular B cells (59). It was recently reported that mar￾ginal zone B cell number is reduced in old mice (60), but whether 
and how this affects production of antibodies to specific antigens 
is unknown. Although present at a low frequency (61), B1 B cells 
play a critical role in the response to S. pneumoniae in mice by the 
secretion of anti-carbohydrate antibodies (62). However, very little 
is known about the effects of aging on their function. A popula￾tion of CD20+CD27+CD43+CD70– human B1 cells was recently 
described (63), but again, nothing is known about how aging 
affects their development or function.
Inflammaging (64), a condition in which there is an accumu￾lation of inflammatory mediators in tissues, has been associated 
with aging. The source of these inflammatory factors has been 
proposed to be cells that have acquired a senescence-associated 
secretory phenotype (SASP) (65). The SASP could be acquired by 
cells once they have aged, or it may occur gradually in various pop￾ulations over time as they acquire DNA lesions that in turn trigger 
the increased production of inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 
(66, 67). Regardless of how the shift occurs from a salutary to an 
inflammatory milieu, the end result may be a negative effect on 
the ability of naive lymphocytes from the bone marrow or thymus 
to lodge in an organ such as the spleen as well as the function of 
mature lymphocytes already resident in that tissue. In the latter 
case, for example, CD8+ T cells that accumulate in aged individu￾als proliferate poorly (68, 69), and, as discussed in more detail in 
the following section, CD4+ T cells exhibit reduced T cell receptor 
signaling intensity and altered production of various cytokines 
following antigen binding (70, 71).
The precise source of the various inflammatory mediators may 
vary between individuals. In one scenario, age-related changes in 
microenvironmental elements such as stromal cells or dendritic 
cells (72) would result in a shift from a salutary to an inflammatory 
environment. However, it is equally plausible that changes occur￾ring in aging B and T cells or innate effectors (26) may alter micro￾environmental elements. For example, with increased age, naive 
CD4+ T cells exhibit biased differentiation into Th17 instead of 
Th1 and Th2 cells, and the inflammatory mediators secreted by the 
latter cells could in turn affect stromal cells or other environmental 
Figure 2
The strength of the immune response declines with age. Multiple age-related changes can affect the composition and function of lymphocytes 
in secondary lymphoid tissues. CD4+ Th cells exhibit activation defects and increased differentiation into Th17 cells. CD8+ T cells undergo an 
oligoclonal expansion and loss of CD28 in humans and exhibit impaired function. The number of B cells that respond to influenza is reduced, and 
antibody avidity in response to carbohydrate antigens is diminished. In addition, the tissue environment includes an increased concentration of 
inflammatory cytokines, which may be produced by stromal elements, dendritic cells, or aging B and T cells. The increased number of memory 
cells that occupy tissue niches and the inflammatory milieu in turn may compromise the ability of naive B and T cells migrating from the bone 
marrow and thymus to lodge in the tissue. Together, these changes result in diminished immune function in the elderly.

populations (73). The development of Th17 cells is dependent on 
the basic leucine zipper transcription factor ATF-like (BATF) tran￾scription factor (74), but why its expression might increase with 
age is not clear. Similarly, the CD8+CD28– memory T cells that 
accumulate in aged humans may also be a source of inflammatory 
cytokines (68, 69) that affect the function of stromal elements. The 
specific cells and the order in which age-related changes occur in 
them may vary between individuals as a result of differences in 
genetic background and environmental exposure. However, once 
the effects of aging are manifest in one or more target popula￾tions, a vicious cycle may initiate that leads to a downward spiral of 
increasingly compromised immune function (Figure 2).
Intracellular changes in developing and mature 
lymphocytes
The analysis of stem and progenitor cells from various tissues has 
revealed that aging often results in the dysregulation of similar 
molecular pathways (75). For example, alterations in the PI3K 
pathway are frequently exhibited by aging cells. Consistent with 
this observation, HSCs are depleted due to build-up of ROS in 
mice in which FOXO, a key downstream PI3K component, is 
deleted (76). Levels of ROS in cells may also be regulated by ataxia 
telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase, and age-related declines in 
expression of ATM can result in an increase in ROS in cells (77, 78). 
Increased expression of tumor suppressor proteins such as p16Ink4a
and ARF also occurs in aging cells from multiple tissues (79, 80). 
Expression of p16Ink4a results in activation of retinoblastoma, lead￾ing to cell cycle inhibition, while p19Arf promotes the activity of 
p53, which induces cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. We have had 
a particular interest in understanding why the quality of lymphoid 
progenitors is reduced with age, and recent studies have shown 
that both Ink4a and Arf expression increases in pro-B cells from 
old mice and that inhibiting their expression can partially reverse 
the effects of aging (81). We also observed increased expression of 
Ink4a, but not Arf, in ETPs and their DN progeny (82).
Other age-associated changes may be more specific to the hema￾topoietic system. For example, altered expression of various B lin￾eage transcription factors has been proposed to underlie declines 
in B lymphopoiesis (83). Recent interest has focused on BATF, 
the expression of which is highest in the hematopoietic system, 
in the decline of lymphoid-biased HSCs during aging. Wang and 
colleagues demonstrated that BATF levels increased in HSCs in 
response to DNA damage and that this resulted in the differentia￾tion of lymphoid-biased HSCs at the expense of their self-renewal 
(27). This is a particularly interesting finding, because it provides 
a molecular mechanism for the age-related decline in the number 
of lymphoid-biased HSCs discussed above.
Although there has been considerable focus on stem and progen￾itor cells, aging also affects patterns of gene expression in mature 
B and T cells. As previously discussed, class switch recombination 
is impaired in aging murine and human B cells due to decreased 
expression of enzymes such as AID (53, 84). Aberrant T cell sig￾naling has also been associated with aging (48, 85), and the list 
of dysregulated genes continues to grow, as indicated by several 
recent reports (86–88), two of which focused on altered expression 
of dual specific phosphatases (DUSPs). DUSPs deactivate target 
kinases, including those in the MAPK pathway whose activity is 
critical for T cell activation, differentiation, and cytokine produc￾tion. One study reported the induction and sustained transcrip￾tion of DUSP4 in activated CD4+ memory T cells from humans 65 
and older, which correlated with their altered cytokine production 
and an impaired ability to provide help for B cells (87). A subse￾quent report from the same laboratory described the increased 
expression of DUSP6 in naive CD4+ human T cells, which resulted 
in activation of a lower fraction of Th cells, particularly in response 
to low-affinity stimuli (88).
These signaling abnormalities in HSCs, lymphoid progenitors, 
and mature B and T cells may occur, at least in part, as a result of 
the age-related alterations in the systemic and local tissue envi￾ronments discussed above. For example, over time exposure to an 
inflammatory milieu might induce epigenetic modifications that 
affect the expression of genes required for growth, survival, or dif￾ferentiation (89, 90). The observation that changes in methylation 
status as a result of differential expression of various DNA meth￾yltransferases (DNMTs) can affect HSC behavior is consistent with 
this view. In this regard, loss of DNMT3a impairs differentiation of 
HSCs while their number increases in the bone marrow (91), and 
mice with hypomorphic expression of DNMT1 exhibit relatively 
normal myeloerythroid potential but show a significant block in 
lymphoid development (92). Nevertheless, cell-autonomous events

might also contribute to aging. Thus, repeated cell division may 
result in progressive telomere shortening that in turn results in 
DNA damage that can no longer be repaired efficiently due to age￾related defects in DNA repair mechanisms (75). It is interesting 
that telomere dysfunction has been associated with changes in 
mitochondrial metabolism (93), in view of a study linking compro￾mised mitochondrial function and depressed thymopoiesis (94).
Rejuvenating the aging immune system
The ultimate goal of research in immune system aging is to use the 
information to develop strategies to stimulate immunity in the 
elderly (summarized in Table 1). As discussed above, a number of 
molecules have been identified whose aberrant expression contrib￾utes to aging, and targeting these molecules may potentially slow 
or reverse the aging process. For example, pharmacologic inhibi￾tion of Cdc42, a small Rho GTPase whose increased expression has 
been linked to murine HSC aging, with a selective Cdc42 activity 
inhibitor rejuvenated HSCs (95), and other studies have shown the 
potential of antioxidants to improve the function of old HSCs (76, 
96). As additional age-related changes in the expression of tran￾scription factors, signaling intermediates, cell cycle regulators, and 
microRNAs (97, 98) are defined, novel pharmacologic interven￾tions will likely emerge. In this regard, the increased expression 
of DUSP6 in naive CD4+ T cells described above was due to the 
age-related decline in miR-181a expression (88).
Because of the key role played by T lymphocytes in the immune 
response and the clear effect of aging on mature CD4+ and CD8+
cells, rejuvenation of the involuted thymus to replenish the periph￾eral T cell pool has been of considerable interest. A complete dis￾cussion of the various hormones and growth factors involved has 
been reviewed elsewhere (99, 100), but there has been considerable 
interest in using classical endocrine hormones such as GH and 
IGF-1 as well as other agents such as IL-7 and FGF7 to stimulate 
thymopoiesis (Figure 3).
GH and IGF-1 bind to receptors expressed on thymocytes (101) 
and thymic epithelial cells (102), and numerous studies (42) have 
shown that thymus size is increased in old mice administered 
either hormone (101, 103). These preclinical data were the basis 
for a human clinical trial to determine whether one year of daily 
GH administration could rejuvenate the thymus of HIV-infected 
adults. Despite low viral loads, those enrolled in this trial had low 
CD4+ T cell counts. GH treatment resulted in increased thymic 
mass, increased thymic output as measured by T cell receptor rear￾rangement excision circles in circulating T cells, and increased 
numbers of naive CD4+ T cells. Many GH effects are mediated 
through induction of IGF-1 production, and the elevated levels 
of IGF-1 in GH-treated patients were consistent with this. Admin￾istration of IGF-1 to old mice enhances thymopoiesis predomi￾nantly through effects on thymic epithelial cells and not thymo￾cytes (104). The latter observations suggest that GH in the human 
subjects resulted in an induction of IGF-1 that functioned in a 
similar manner. It is important to note that the effects of GH were 
not thymus specific, as the subjects also had expanded numbers of 
naive peripheral CD4+ T cells (105).
In contrast to GH and IGF-1, which increase thymus cell number 
approximately two-fold in mice (101), FGF7 is particularly remark￾able because its administration to old mice results in a renewal of 
the thymic microenvironment, increased numbers of ETPs, and a 
restoration of thymus cellularity to levels observed in the young 
(106, 107). FGF7, also known as keratinocyte growth factor and 
marketed as Kepivance (palifermin; Biovitrum), is approved by 
the FDA for treatment of oral mucositis in patients undergoing 
Figure 3
Selected strategies to rejuvenate the involuted thymus. The potential of several hormones and growth factors to rejuvenate the involuted thymus 
has been tested in various preclinical and clinical trials. Many of these factors can be grouped into three categories. Those in the first (i), such as 
IL-7, bind to progenitors in the bone marrow and thymus and have only modest effects on thymopoiesis. There is little evidence that IL-7 has effects 
on thymic stromal cells. Instead, the benefit of IL-7 may lie in its ability to stimulate peripheral T cell survival/expansion. The second category (ii) 
includes hormones such as GH that have been demonstrated in preclinical and clinical trials to stimulate thymopoiesis and increase thymic size. 
Many GH effects are mediated through induction of IGF-1. IGF-1 can bind to receptors on thymic stroma and thymocytes, although its actions are 
primarily mediated through effects on the former cells. Stromal cell–derived factors presumably then act on thymocytes (curved arrow). A third 
category of factors (iii), typified by FGF7, bind to stromal cells but not thymocytes. Stromal cell–induced factors then act on thymocytes (curved 
arrow), and we have recently demonstrated that effects include downregulation of Ink4a in ETPs (82). The thymopoietic effects of several addi￾tional factors have been evaluated, and recent detailed reviews should be consulted for more information (99, 100).

myelotoxic therapy. We hypothesized that the increased thymopoi￾esis in FGF7-treated old mice occurred because signals from the 
rejuvenated microenvironment in turn reduced Ink4a expression in 
ETPs. As predicted, levels of Ink4a expression in ETPs and DN cells 
harvested from FGF7-treated mice were downregulated, and these 
cells exhibited enhanced proliferation (82). These observations are 
consistent with a recent report showing that conditional deletion 
of Ink4a in DN thymocytes can significantly delay thymic involu￾tion (108). It will thus be of interest to identify the factor(s) released 
from FGF7-stimulated thymic epithelial cells that then act on aged 
ETPs and DN cells, as these could have therapeutic potential.
Strategies that focus on mature B and T cells may also be of 
value in stimulating immunity in the elderly. For example, if naive 
lymphocytes are unable to lodge efficiently in the spleen because 
niches are occupied by memory cells, deletion of the latter cells 
might create space. The depletion of mature lymphocytes might 
have feedback effects on primary lymphoid organs, as abrogation 
of mature B cells in aging mice has been reported to stimulate pri￾mary bone marrow B lymphopoiesis (109). It may also be possible 
to target specific pathways in old lymphocytes. For example, inhi￾bition of mTOR, a PI3K pathway intermediate, with rapamycin 
has been shown to stimulate CD8+ T cell responses in preclinical 
studies (110). Targeting the expression of DUSP4 (87) or DUSP6 
(88) in old memory or naive CD4+ T cells, respectively, may also 
have therapeutic potential. In support of this, the reduction of 
DUSP6 levels by increasing miR-181a expression or repressing 
activity with the allosteric inhibitor BCI improved the responsive￾ness of old naive CD4+ T cells (88).
Correcting age-related deficiencies in lymphocyte progenitors 
or mature T and B cells may result in significant restoration of 
immune function in the elderly. However, these cells would still 
reside in an aged microenvironment that could eventually dampen 
their potential to mature or function. Consistent with this view, 
Haynes and colleagues (111) found that CD4+ T cells generated 
from old HSCs were functional in young but not old hosts, imply￾ing that the aged thymic or peripheral microenvironments criti￾cally influence the degree to which immune system rejuvenation 
can occur. In view of this point, optimal interventions may need to 
address the effects of aging on multiple cellular targets.
Approaches to inhibit or reverse aging should be widely available 
and applicable to a large cohort. In addition to pharmacologic inter￾ventions, caloric restriction (CR) may also meet these criteria. CR 
has been reported to have multiple beneficial effects on the immune 
system of both rodents and non-human primates that include a 
delay in the accumulation of senescent T cells (112) and a stimu￾lation of thymopoiesis (113). This latter effect is at first puzzling, 
because CR reportedly reduces IGF-1 secretion (114), and low lev￾els of IGF-1 have, as discussed above, been associated with thymic 
involution. However, CR may also increase GH levels (114), which 
could be thymopoietic, or may work through IGF-1–independent 
pathways. For example, CR has been reported to block the age-relat￾ed elevation of the thymic proadipogenic master regulator, PPARγ
(113). In addition to further studies to increase our understanding 
of how CR affects the immune system, we also need to learn more 
about when it should commence in view of a report that beneficial 
effects were observed when it commenced in adults but were not 
evident when initiated in prepubertal or aged non-human primates 
(112). A final point is that, while CR is particularly attractive because 
it is a non-invasive approach, getting a large number of individuals 
to adopt this regimen might be challenging.
Caveats in immune system rejuvenation
The studies reviewed above provide proof-of-concept data that 
pharmacologic stimulation of immunity in the elderly is possible, 
and suggest that such interventions could be administered to a 
large cohort of individuals. However, as the field moves forward, 
there are several points to consider. First, how long do agents 
need to be administered, and how much rejuvenation is neces￾sary in order to observe positive effects on immune function? 
These issues are relevant to the use of GH, IGF-1, and FGF7 to 
stimulate the thymus, because their effects are transient and the 
thymus reverts to its former size following the cessation of treat￾ment. Another caveat is that factors such as GH, IGF-1, and FGF7 
have widespread systemic effects due to the expression of their 
receptors on cells in multiple tissues. A concern with the use of 
some agents is that neoplastic cells might also express receptors 
resulting in tumor growth (115). Thus, like any drug, the use of 
these hormones to rejuvenate the thymus must be balanced with 
potential adverse effects. It will also be crucial to ensure that the 
rejuvenated immune system functions normally. In particular, it 
will be important to establish that the effector populations that 
develop have been appropriately tolerized and are not autoreactive. 
The fact that many autoimmune diseases occur in late adulthood 
makes this a particularly important issue (116).
Conclusions and perspectives
As indicated above, a tremendous amount is now known regarding 
the cellular changes that occur in the aging immune system and 
the molecular events that underlie them. Thus, it is not unreason￾able to expect that this information will continue to be translated 
into therapies to rejuvenate the aging immune system.
It is likely that the effects of aging on the immune system will 
not be uniform between individuals. Thus, an ultimate goal would 
be to identify key biomarkers and establish simple laboratory tests 
to define each person’s aging profile. Such information could 
then be used to develop a personalized approach in which targeted 
interventions could be directed to the individual’s specific aging 
deficit. However, whatever standard of care is ultimately adopted 
for stimulating immunity, the emphasis should not necessarily be 
placed on increasing life span. Rather, the aim is to increase health 
span, defined as years of healthy living (117).
