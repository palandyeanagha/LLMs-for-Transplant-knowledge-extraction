Abstract
Gene products of all three distinct nitric oxide synthases are
present in the mammalian kidney. This mosaic topography
of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms probably reflects
distinct functional role played by each enzyme. While nitric
oxide (NO) is cytotoxic to isolated renal tubules, inhibition
of NO production in vivo invariably results in the aggrava￾tion of renal dysfunction in various models of acute renal
failure. We reasoned that the existing ambiguity on the role
of nitric oxide in acute renal failure is in part due to the lack of
selective NOS inhibitors. Phosphorothioated derivatives of
antisense oligodeoxynucleotides targeting a conserved se￾quence within the open reading frame of the cDNA encod￾ing the inducible NOS (iNOS) were designed to produce a
selective knock-down of this enzyme. In vivo use of these
antisense constructs attenuated acute renal failure in rats
subjected to renal ischemia. This effect was due, at least in
part, to the rescue of tubular epithelium from lethal injury.
Application of antisense constructs did not affect endothelial
NOS, as evidenced by a spared NO release after the infusion
of bradykinin during in vivo monitoring with an NO-selec￾tive microelectrode. In conclusion, the data provide direct
evidence for the cytotoxic effects of NO produced via iNOS
in the course of ischemic acute renal failure, and offer a
novel method to selectively prevent the induction of this en￾zyme. (J. Clin. Invest. 1996. 97:2377–2383.) Key words: is￾chemia • antisense oligonucleotides • nitric oxide • cytotoxic￾ity • NO-selective microelectrode
Introduction
Products of all three distinct nitric oxide synthase (NOS)1
genes are represented in the mammalian kidney: endothelial
constitutive NOS is expressed in the tubular epithelium, in ad￾dition to its localization to the vascular endothelium; neuronal
isoform is found in the macula densa cells and epithelium of
Bowman’s capsule; whereas inducible NOS is present in the
proximal tubule, glomerulus, medullary thick ascending limb,
inner medullary collecting duct and has virtually unlimited rep￾resentation in various pathologic conditions (1–4). This mosaic
topography of all known isoforms of NOS, probably, reflects
distinct functional role played by each isoform, depending on
the requirements and conditions of the microenvironment in
specific segments of the nephron. Under the circumstances,
application of nonselective inhibitors of NOS would produce
uninterpretable results on the involvement and role of individ￾ual isoforms.
Indeed, there is growing ambiguity as to the role of nitric
oxide (NO) and its metabolic product peroxinitrite (5–7)
(ONOO2) in the pathophysiology of acute renal failure. NO
and ONOO2 have been shown to mediate hypoxia-reperfu￾sion injury in different organs including the kidney (8), while
the inhibitors of NOS exhibit antiinflammatory properties (9,
10). Paradoxically, NOS inhibitors, NG-nitro L-arginine methyl
ester (L-NAME) or NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA),
in in vitro experiments, protected renal tubular epithelium
against hypoxic injury (8), whereas they invariably aggravated
renal dysfunction in different in vivo models of acute renal fail￾ure (11–13). Therefore, the major challenge is to reconcile
these experimentally solid, but controversial observations.
One of the possible explanations for such discrepant in vitro
and in vivo effects of NOS inhibitors is in a poor selectivity of
the available antagonists (14, 15). Investigation of the func￾tional role of each isoform awaits highly selective inhibitors.
We elected to utilize the antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (AS￾ODN) (16) strategy for a selective knock-down of inducible
NOS (iNOS). Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides targeting a
conserved sequence within the open reading frame of the
cDNA encoding iNOS were designed to produce selective knock￾down of this enzyme. In vivo use of these antisense constructs
attenuated acute renal failure in rats subjected to renal is￾chemia. This effect was due, at least in part, to the rescue of tu￾bular epithelial cells from injury induced by a product of iNOS.
Methods
Design and synthesis of oligodeoxynucleotides. The phosphorothioated
oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized in an automated solid-phase
DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Since at
least two isoforms of iNOS are expressed in the proximal nephron of
cytokine-stressed rat kidneys, vascular smooth muscle-specific and
macrophage-specific (1), we targeted a conserved sequence within
the open reading frame (ORF) of their cDNAs, nucleotides 1829–
1809, which are homologous in mouse and rat macrophage, as well as

18) AS-ODN-ORF: (59-39) CTT CAG AGT CTG CCC ATT GCT.
To account for any possible nonspecific effects of oligodeoxynu￾cleotides, several control sequences were used:
(a) Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides directed toward the initia￾tion codon of the vascular smooth muscle isoform (AS-ODN-VSM),
nucleotides 6-26 (GenBank accession No. D14051): 59-39 GCA AGC
CAT GTC TGT GAC TTT GTG; (b) Sense and scrambled oligode￾oxynucleotides: sense primer (59-39) AGC AAT GGG CAG ACT
CTG AAG, and scrambled primer (59-39) TCT CAG TGA GCC
CTC ATT CTG. 
The designed sequences showed no homology with other known
mammalian sequences deposited in GenBank database, as screened
using Blast program (19). Oligonucleotides were purified, dried, re￾suspended in 10 mM Tris/1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, and quantified spec￾trophotometrically. These constructs were injected into rats subjected
to renal ischemia, a classical model of acute renal failure which is as￾sociated with the induction of iNOS (1). 
Surgical techniques. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 110–130
grams were allowed rat chow and water ad libitum for 5 d before ex￾periments. After an overnight fast, animals were anesthetized with
ketamine HCl and xylazine HCl (11.6 and 0.77 mg/100 grams body
weight, respectively). Bilateral renal pedicle cross-clamping for 45
min was performed as previously described (20). 24 h after reperfu￾sion, blood was drawn for blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine,
at which time the animals were killed, kidneys flushed with normal
saline, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (followed by embedding
in Tissue-Tek and frozen sectioning) for immunocytochemistry and
with 10% formalin (followed by paraffin-embedment) for morpho￾logical scoring. Pathological findings were analyzed in a blind fashion
according to the previously reported criteria (21) which encompass
both the degree of lethal injury to the epithelium and tubulo-obstruc￾tive manifestations. The second ischemic kidney was harvested for
preparation of isolated cortical tubules and for Western analysis of
iNOS (see below). Oligonucleotides were injected intracardially at
the concentration 1 mg/kg and L-NAME (Bachem California, Tor￾rance, CA) was injected intraperitoneally at the concentration 75 mg/
kg 10 h before the surgery.
Nitrite production by renal cortical tubules. Harvested ischemic or
control kidneys were placed in ice-cold DMEM, cortical tissue was
dissected and minced. The fraction of cortical tubules was obtained
after successive passages through the nylon mesh filters 150 and 75
mm, as previously detailed (8). The collected tubular fraction was re￾suspended in DMEM without phenol red and incubated for 6 h at
37 8C in the atmosphere of 95% O2 1 5% CO2
. At the end of incuba￾tion, the supernatant was collected and the concentration of nitrite
was determined according to the Griess technique (22). The amount
of protein in each sample was determined using bicinchoninic acid
protein assay reagent (23). 
In vivo NO monitoring. Anesthetized rats (100 mg/kg intraperi￾toneal injection of Inactin-Byk) were fixed on a heating table, a
venous line was placed, and the left kidney was accessed via a flank
incision. The kidney was immobilized in a holding cup, and a precali￾brated NO-selective reinforced microelectrode with a tip diameter of
30 mm (24), designed for in vivo experiments (Intra Medical, Nagoya,
Japan), was driven using a micromanipulator (Zeiss-Eppendorff) to
impale the renal cortex. After the acquisition of baseline measurements,
bradykinin (25 nmol/100 grams) was injected intravenously (25). 5–10
min later, depending on the duration of the response, L-NAME (50
mmol/100 grams) was injected intravenously. Electrode current was
digitally transformed using a two-channel recording system Duo-18
(World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) and stored in a PC mi￾crocomputer. Calibration of the electrode was performed using NO
donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP; Molecular Probes,
Eugene, OR), according to the previously described technique (24). 
Expression of iNOS in the kidney. Harvested kidneys were homo￾genized in liquid nitrogen, the lysates were electrophoresed on 5%
SDS–polyacrylamide gel, and Western blotting was performed with
monoclonal antibodies to iNOS, according to the manufacturer’s in￾structions (Transduction Labs, Lexington, Kentucky). Immunohis￾tochemical staining of frozen 8-mm sections was performed using in￾direct immunofluorescence technique. The thawed cryosections were
treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min, and the nonspecific bind￾ing sites were blocked with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Sections
were incubated for 60 min with monoclonal antibodies (0.5 mg/ml
each) against iNOS or endothelial isoform of NOS (eNOS) (Trans￾duction Labs), followed by the rhodamine-conjugated anti–mouse
IgG. Control sections were subjected to second andibody only.
Mounted preparations were examined under an inverted fluores￾cence microscope. Images were similarly processed using Image-1
software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). 
Morphologic evaluation of kidneys. Formalin-fixed sections were
stained with hematoxylin-eosin and scored in a blind fashion for the se￾verity of acute renal failure, based on the well established criteria (21).
Results
To optimize the experimental conditions for in vivo delivery of
systemically injected oligodeoxynucleotides, the time-course
of their accumulation in the proximal nephron was examined.
In experiments with 39-biotinylated AS-ODN derivatives, we
found that maximal labeling of proximal tubular epithelium
occurred 4–8 h after systemic injection (Fig. 1). According to
the above time-course, the rats were treated with control and
experimental ODN constructs ca. 8 h before cross-clamping of
renal arteries. As shown in Fig. 2 A, administration of AS￾ODN-ORF resulted in a dramatic functional protection of kid￾neys from acute ischemia. The concentration of plasma BUN
and creatinine in this group was not different from sham-oper￾ated animals and significantly lower than in experimental ani￾mals receiving AS-ODN-VSM, as well as sense (S) and scram￾Figure 1.

killed at the indicated times. Kidney sections were prepared, as de￾tailed in Methods, and stained with streptavidin conjugated with alka￾line phosphatase. Diffuse cytoplasmic staining becomes conspicuous 
at 4 h after injection and increases in intensity at 8 h. 3190.

bled (Scr) constructs. In sharp contrast with the results
obtained after selective knock-down of iNOS, the use of a non￾selective inhibitor of NOS, L-NAME, had no therapeutic ef￾fect (Fig. 2 B), illustrating the validity of our zero-hypothesis
on the functional diversity of NO produced at different sites
and by different NOS isoforms. 
To verify the efficacy of AS-ODN-ORF treatment, nitrite
production by freshly-isolated cortical tubules obtained from
control and ischemic kidneys was determined in vitro. As evi￾dent from Fig. 3 A, ischemic kidneys show almost sixfold in￾crease in nitrite production. Pretreatment with AS-ODN-ORF
virtually abolished this increase in nitrite production. Further￾more, the expression of iNOS in AS-ODN-ORF-pretreated is￾chemic kidney homogenates was significantly attenuated com￾pared to ischemic control (Fig. 3 B), again confirming the
efficacy of AS-ODN-ORF treatment. Immunohistochemical
data (Fig. 4) complemented these findings. While immunode￾tectable iNOS was conspicuously enhanced in ischemic kid￾neys (Fig. 4 C), antisense constructs partially prevented this in￾duction (Fig. 4 E). Of note, staining with antibodies to eNOS
did not reveal significant differences between the experimental
groups (Fig. 4, B, D, and F). 
To obtain additional insights into the selectivity of the AS￾ODN-ORF towards iNOS, in vivo monitoring of NO release
from control and ischemic kidneys was performed using an
NO-selective electrochemical technique (24). 24 h after cross￾clamping, the left kidney of experimental or control animals
was immobilized (to prevent breathing artifacts) and impaled
with the precalibrated electrode working in the amperometric
mode (Fig. 5 A). As shown in Fig. 5, B–D depicting represen￾tative NO-electrode tracings, intravenous administration of
bradykinin (single arrowhead) resulted in a substantial in￾crease in NO release, as judged by the amplitude of the cur￾rent, in control (B) and AS-ODN-ORF-pretreated rats sub￾jected to renal ischemia (D). In contrast, bradykinin had only a
marginal effect in nontreated ischemic rats (C). These obser￾vations on the blunted NO release in renal ischemia corrobo￾rate the previously reported findings in norepinephrine-induced
renal failure which showed the absence of vasorelaxation in re￾sponse to endothelium-dependent vasodilators (3). Fig. 6 rep￾resents the summary of baseline currents detected with NO￾selective electrode and the amplitude of responses elicited by
bradykinin infusion. It is evident that the baseline current re￾corded from ischemic kidneys was higher than that detected in
control and AS-ODN-ORF-treated ischemic kidneys (A). Fur￾thermore, although profoundly suppressed in nontreated is￾chemic kidneys, the bradykinin-induced elevation in NO re￾lease was spared in AS-ODN-ORF–treated animals (B). These
data further substantiate our conclusion that the applied anti￾sense construct resulted in a selective knock-down of iNOS. 
To elucidate the mechanism of protection afforded by AS￾ODN-ORF, histological scoring of injury to the nephron was
performed (criteria used were reported previously) (21). As
summarized in Fig. 7, the major registered effects of AS-ODN￾ORF were in prevention of tubular necrosis, diminution of the
loss of the brush border membrane, and reduction in cast for￾mation. Since both the loss of the brush border and cast forma￾tion reflect the degree of tubular cell injury, it can be implied
that the AS-ODN-ORF protection of renal function against is￾chemia results from prevention of sublethal and lethal injury
to renal tubular epithelium. 
Discussion
Cytotoxicity of NO and its metabolite ONOO2 has been dem￾onstrated in diverse cell types (5, 6) and has been implicated in
the development of atherosclerosis (7), DNA damage and mu￾tation in human lymphoblastoid cells (26), lipid peroxidation

bular epithelial cells (8). Hence, there is a plethora of observa￾tions that causally relate NO to cytotoxicity.
It can be argued that the available inhibitors of NOS are
not selective enough and/or sufficiently specific (14, 15). Dif￾ferent types of NOS may differently affect cell viability, as has
recently been demonstrated in mice deficient in neuronal NOS
(33). Therefore, if alternative sources of NO exert reciprocal
effects, the use of nonselective NOS inhibitors may produce
ambiguous results. This is, probably, the case with the results
obtained in in vivo and in vitro models of acute renal failure (8,
11–13). To circumvent these problems, we elected to use the
antisense oligodeoxynucleotide strategy. We have previously
investigated the effects of antisense S-ODN to inducible nitric
oxide synthase on the viability of African green monkey kid￾ney cells, BSC-1, under resting conditions and after exposure
to oxidant stress, and demonstrated their cytoprotective effect
(34). These in vitro findings prompted us to investigate the ef￾fect of antisense constructs on the course of ischemic acute re￾nal failure in vivo. Only through a selective knock-down of
iNOS has it become possible to demonstrate the functional
disparity of NOS’s in the kidney: targeted inhibition of iNOS
expression attenuated ischemia-induced dysfunction, while a
nonselective inhibitor L-NAME was ineffective, and even re￾sulted in the deterioration of renal function compared to non￾treated animals. These observations reinforce the recent find￾ings of submaximal eNOS stimulation early in the course of
norepinephrine-induced acute renal failure and profound vas￾oconstriction accompanying L-NAME infusion (3). Collec￾tively, these observations disclose the reciprocity in NOS’s
functions, implying that the degree of injury is linked to the
iNOS, while the restoration of renal function after noxious
stimuli depends on eNOS. When the function of all isoforms of
NOS is blocked, as with a nonselective inhibitor, the deleteri￾ous consequences of inhibiting eNOS invariably prevail over
the possible benefits of inhibiting iNOS.
The data presented above provide direct evidence for the
cytotoxic effects of NO produced via iNOS, and offer a novel
method to selectively prevent the induction of this enzyme.
The application of this approach in rats with renal ischemia re￾sulted in a dramatic attenuation of epithelial cell damage, the
established hallmarks of the syndrome of acute renal failure. 
While in vitro use of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides has
been successfully utilized in the past (16, 35), there are but a
few examples of their efficacy as therapeutic agents in vivo
(36–38). Intraperitoneal injection in mice of antisense phos￾phorothioate ODN hybridizing to the AUG translation initia￾tion codon of mRNA encoding murine protein kinase C-a re￾sults in a dose- dependent reduction of the targeted mRNA in
the liver with the IC-50 value of 30–50 mg/kg (39). Antisense
phosphorothioate constructs to galanin can be successfully in￾troduced through the proximal end of a transsected sciatic
nerve to the dorsal root ganglia (40). Transcatheter delivery of
c-myc antisense ODN results in the reduction of neointimal
formation in a model of coronary artery balloon injury (41). In
our case, the need to target the proximal tubular epithelium,
the site of preferential injury in acute ischemia-reperfusion
model, has certain advantages for applying antisense ODN
strategy. The substantial accumulation of systemically injected
phosphorothioate ODNs by the kidney, and especially by the
proximal tubular epithelium, has been demonstrated previ￾ously in mice and rats (42–44), thus drastically reducing (at
least 10-fold) the required concentration of ODN to z 1 mg/kg
body weight. 
The blockade of the inducible enzyme iNOS carries an ad￾ditional potential benefit, allowing for the reparative processes
to take place in the postischemic period. In this respect, it has

been demonstrated that NO attenuates protein and DNA syn￾thesis (45), the effects which may hamper reparative processes
in the injured epithelial cells. Hence, the dramatic functional
and structural preservation of ischemic kidneys treated with
antisense oligomers to iNOS, as demonstrated above, may be
the consequence of both the reduced cytotoxicity and the en￾hanced regenerative processes. The successful use of antisense
oligonucleotide strategy targeting the iNOS expression in alle￾viating ischemic renal damage represents the first attempt at
this approach in the treatment of acute renal failure and, possi￾bly, other pathological conditions accompanied by the induc￾tion of this gene.
