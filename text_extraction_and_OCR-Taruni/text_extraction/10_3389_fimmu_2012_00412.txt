Properdin, the only positive regulatory protein of the complement system, acts as
both a stabilizer of the alternative pathway (AP) convertases and as a selective pattern
recognition molecule of certain microorganisms and host cells (i.e., apoptotic/necrotic
cells) by serving as a platform for de novo C3b,Bb assembly. Properdin, a highly positively
charged protein, normally exists as cyclic dimers (P2), trimers (P3), and tetramers (P4) of
head-to-tail associations of monomeric 53 kDa subunits. While most complement proteins
are produced mainly in the liver, properdin is synthesized primarily by various cell types,
including neutrophils, monocytes, primary T cells, and shear-stressed endothelial cells
resulting in properdin serum levels of 4–25 μg/ml. Multiple inflammatory agonists stimulate
the release of properdin from stimulated leukocytes into the cellular microenvironment.
Concentrated, focused increases in properdin levels may lead to stabilization and initiation
of AP convertases, thus greatly amplifying the complement response to a local stimulus.
This review highlights current knowledge related to these properties and discusses the
implications of properdin production in a pro-inflammatory microenvironment.

THE COMPLEMENT SYSTEM ALTERNATIVE PATHWAY
The complement system efficiently defends the host from
pathogenic microorganisms, facilitates removal of immune com￾plexes, and represents an important link between the innate and
adaptive immune systems. Complement comprises three dis￾tinct pathways (classical, alternative, and lectin) that converge at
the activation of the central protein C3. Complement activation
results in direct killing, marking of the target with ligands (C3b,
iC3b, C3d) for innate cellular receptors (CR1/CD35, CR2/CD21,
CR3, CR4, CRIg, CD46), and numerous adaptive cellular and
humoral responses. Sub-products generated during complement
activation (C3a and C5a) are important for phagocyte recruitment
to infection sites. Although complement is beneficial to the body’s
defense system, complement also participates in tissue-damaging
processes occurring in many diseases (reviewed in Oksjoki et al.,
2007; Holers, 2008).
The alternative pathway (AP) represents a true safeguard sys￾tem that is initiated in the fluid-phase by spontaneous hydrolysis
of the thioester bond in C3 to produce C3(H2O), which is func￾tionally and structurally similar to C3b (Pangburn et al., 1981).
Binding of factor B to C3(H2O) in the presence of factor D gen￾erates an unstable fluid-phase C3 convertase (C3(H2O),Bb) that
digests C3 to generate C3b fragments (Pangburn et al., 1980). C3b
fragments possess a labile thioester group that binds covalently to
exposed amino or hydroxyl groups on nearby pathogenic as well
as host membranes. Once bound to a surface, C3b binds factor B,
which is then cleaved byfactor D,generating the membrane-bound
AP C3 convertase (C3b,Bb) that leads to C3b deposition on the
cell surface (Muller-Eberhard and Gotze, 1972; Pangburn, 1998;
Rother, 1998). Properdin, the only positive regulatory protein of
the complement system, and the focus of this review, extends the
half-life of the nascent C3b,Bb convertase (5–10-fold) by forming
the complex C3b,Bb,P (Fearon and Austen, 1975; Schreiber et al.,
1975), leading to accelerated and efficient amplification of C3b
deposition on surfaces (Muller-Eberhard and Gotze, 1972; Pang￾burn, 1998; Rother, 1998). The AP plays a fundamental role in the
amplification of all three pathways because C3b molecules gener￾ated by the classical and lectin pathways contribute to generating
AP C3 convertases (Harboe and Mollnes, 2008; Gulati et al., 2012).
Binding of C3b to the C3b,Bb complex forms the AP C5 convertase
(C3b)2−n,Bb, which is also stabilized by properdin. C5 cleavage
forms C5a and C5b (Medicus et al., 1976), initiating formation
of the membrane attack complex (C5b-C9) that is common to
all complement pathways. Although deposition of C3b occurs on
all cells exposed to activated complement, complement regulatory
proteins control activation on our own cells to prevent unintended
injury (reviewed in Ferreira et al., 2010b; Ricklin et al., 2010).
Unlike the classical and lectin pathways that rely on specific
recognition molecules (C1q and mannan binding lectin/ficolins,
respectively) for initiation, the AP activates on any surface that
lacks the ability to regulate complement. However, the AP
does preferentially target selective carbohydrates and amino acids
recognized by reactive C3b molecules (reviewed in Pangburn
et al., 2008). Moreover, bacterial LPS (Liang-Takasaki et al., 1983;
Clardy, 1994), aggregated immunoglobulins (particularly IgA;
Hiemstra et al., 1987), and natural antibodies (Ratnoff et al., 1983;
Jelezarova and Lutz, 1999; Zhou et al., 2012) can activate the
AP independently from the classical or lectin pathways. Recently,

properdin has been identified as an initiating pattern recognition
molecule of the AP, as will be discussed further.
PROPERDIN: AN ANCIENT COMPLEMENT REGULATORY
MOLECULE OF THE ALTERNATIVE PATHWAY
PROPERDIN STRUCTURE
Properdin, a highly positively charged protein, exists as cyclic
dimers (P2), trimers (P3), and tetramers (P4) of head-to-tail asso￾ciations of monomeric subunits (Smith et al., 1984; Pangburn,
1989). Each monomer is ∼53 kDa (Nolan and Reid, 1990), 26 nm
in length × 2.5 nm in diameter (Smith et al., 1984, 1991), contains
442 amino acid residues, and is composed of seven thrombospodin
repeat type I (TSR0-TSR6) domains (Higgins et al.,1995; Sun et al.,
2004). TSR4 is important in stabilizing the C3b,Bb convertase
complex, and TSR5 in C3b and sulfatide binding. TSR3, how￾ever, is not required for C3b,Bb stabilization nor sulfatide binding
(Higgins et al., 1995). In addition, the properdin monomer con￾tains an N-glycosylation site and 14 C-linked mannosylation sites
at tryptophan residues with unknown function (Hartmann and
Hofsteenge, 2000). These native forms of properdin bind with
a greater affinity to cell-bound C3b,Bb or C3b,B than to cell￾bound C3b, but binding to all three molecules is more favorable
when bound to a cell membrane versus their respective fluid-phase
counterparts (Farries et al., 1988b). Properdin also interacts with
C3(H2O) (a C3b-like protein; Pangburn and Muller-Eberhard,
1980) and the Ba domain of factor B (Farries et al., 1988a), which
is important for AP C3 and C5 convertase formation.
RE-EMERGING ROLE OF PROPERDIN AS A SELECTIVE RECOGNITION
MOLECULE
When properdin was discovered, it was thought to be an initiator
of the AP (Pillemer et al., 1954). This controversial view was later
replaced by the widely accepted notion that properdin serves as a
positive regulator that amplifies the AP by extending the half-life
of the C3 and C5 convertases (Fearon and Austen, 1975; Medi￾cus et al., 1976). Recent reports propose that properdin acts as
a pattern recognition molecule (as discussed ahead). This view
is consistent with the complement initiation function proposed
over 50 years ago (Pillemer et al., 1954) and has re-opened the
controversy regarding the functions of properdin.
Properdin bound to a surface has the potential to initiate
complement activation
Hourcade (2006) demonstrated that properdin, covalently bound
to a biosensor surface, could subsequently recruit C3b and fac￾tor B to form C3b,Bb,P. Importantly, this study also showed that
even when properdin binds to surface-bound C3b, properdin can
still recruit C3b and factor B to form a new convertase. This goes
beyond the “convertase stabilizer” function, in which properdin
binds only once the convertase is already formed. Additional evi￾dence supporting the ability of properdin to initiate complement
activation (by forming de novo C3 convertases on cell surfaces)
comesfrom studies where human embryonic kidney cells (Vuagnat
et al., 2000) or Escherichia coli(Spitzer et al., 2007) were transfected
with a vector expressing a transmembrane form of properdin
on the cell surface, turning the cell surface into an activator of
the AP.
Properdin has been shown to bind to a variety of cell surfaces
Recent studies have reported properdin binding directly to
various non-self surfaces: zymosan (Spitzer et al., 2007; Ferreira
et al., 2010a), rabbit erythrocytes, Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Spitzer
et al., 2007), certain E. coli strains (Spitzer et al., 2007; Stover et al.,
2008), early (Kemper et al., 2008) or late (Xu et al., 2008) apop￾totic cells, necrotic cells (Xu et al., 2008; Ferreira et al., 2010a),
live human leukemia T cell lines (Kemper et al., 2008), normal
human proximal tubular epithelial cells (Gaarkeuken et al., 2008),
Chinese hamster ovary cells (Kemper et al., 2008), neutrophils
(Wirthmueller et al., 1997; Camous et al., 2011), and cartilage
oligomeric matrix protein (Happonen et al., 2010). Furthermore,
bound properdin serves as a platform for de novoC3b,Bb assembly,
leading to C3 cleavage and complement activation on these sur￾faces, suggesting that properdin may serve as a pattern recognition
molecule for AP initiation on targets.
To study the specificity of properdin-target interactions the
physiological forms of properdin (P2–P4) should be separated
from aggregated (“activated”) properdin
Biochemical studies of serum-derived pure properdin indicate
that non-physiological high molecular weight, highly positively
charged polymers (known as Pn or “activated” properdin) form
during long term storage and freezing/thawing (Farries et al., 1987;
Pangburn, 1989). Although “activated” properdin (or Pn) retains
the ability to stabilize AP convertases, it possesses the abnormal
capacity to activate complement in solution (consumption of com￾plement; Pangburn, 1989) and bind non-specifically to surfaces
such as live T cells (Ferreira et al., 2010a) and Nesseriae (Agar￾wal et al., 2010). The studies mentioned in the previous section
(except Agarwal et al., 2010; Ferreira et al., 2010a; Cortes et al.,
2011) and parts of other studies (Kemper et al., 2008; Xu et al.,
2008; Camous et al., 2011) were carried out with unfraction￾ated pure properdin potentially containing aggregates. Studies
using physiological forms of properdin (P2–P4) separated from
non-physiological aggregates, by ion exchange and/or size exclu￾sion chromatography, found native properdin does not bind to
some previously described surfaces, such as rabbit erythrocytes,
live Jurkat cells (Ferreira et al., 2010a) and Neisseria sp. (Agar￾wal et al., 2010). However, native properdin forms do bind to
necrotic cells, yeast cell wall components (Ferreira et al., 2010a),
Chlamydia pneumoniae(Cortes et al.,2011), and activated platelets
(Saggu et al., 2012), suggesting it is a highly selective recognition
molecule. In addition, neutrophil-derived native/physiological
properdin can bind to apoptotic T cells (Kemper et al., 2008)
and neutrophils (Wirthmueller et al., 1997; Camous et al., 2011),
while properdin, in the context of C3-deficient serum can bind
to dying cells (Xu et al., 2008). Interestingly, T cell-derived prop￾erdin is ∼100 times more active than serum properdin (Schwaeble
et al., 1993) when tested in a traditional AP hemolytic assay,
but the molecular mechanisms involved in the increased activ￾ity remain unknown. Although it has been speculated that
serum-derived, unfractionated properdin (containing aggregated
“activated” properdin) may be similar to native neutrophil- or T
cell-derived properdin, biochemical experimental evidence is lack￾ing. Moreover, activated properdin forms (Pn), are not normally
in circulation (or are tightly controlled) since their presence leads

Cortes et al. Functions of locally released properdin
to systemic complement activation and consumption (Pangburn,
1989). Based upon available experimental evidence, future studies
should be carried out only with native properdin forms (sepa￾rated from “activated” properdin), or with fresh leukocyte-derived
properdin, in order to effectively determine specific interactions
between properdin and surfaces and not over-estimate the role of
properdin (due to aggregates) in complement activation.
Surface-bound properdin may lead to complement activation
by recruiting C3b molecules derived from different sources. For
instance, it is possible that properdin binds C3b generated during
the activation of any of the three complement pathways or recruits
soluble C3(H2O) (a C3b-like molecule) to form a membrane￾bound C3(H2O),Bb convertase. We have recently determined that
physiological forms of properdin bound to activated platelets,
but not resting platelets, recruits both C3(H2O) and factor B,
generating a functional C3(H2O),Bb convertase that promotes
complement activation on platelets (Saggu et al., 2012), whereas
platelet-bound C3(H2O) alone has been shown to not produce a
functional convertase (Hamad et al., 2010).
THE ROLE OF PROPERDIN IN THE LOCAL
MICROENVIRONMENT
SOURCES OF PROPERDIN
Unlike most other complement proteins, which are produced
mainly in the liver, properdin is synthesized by various cell
types (Table 1, Figure 1) resulting in properdin serum levels
of 4–25 μg/ml (Pangburn, 1989; Nolan and Reid, 1993; Fijen
et al., 1999; Schwaeble and Reid, 1999; Xu et al., 2008). Multiple
inflammatory agonists, such as TNF-α, C5a, or fMLP, stimu￾late the release of properdin (Table 1) into the pro-inflammatory
microenvironment to induce local AP activation.
LOCAL RELEASE OF PROPERDIN
Concentrated transient increases in local properdin levels due to
cell production (i.e., T cells, monocytes, and neutrophils) would
likely lead to stabilization (reviewed in Schwaeble and Reid, 1999)
and initiation of the AP convertases, thus greatly amplifying the
complement response to a local stimulus, in particular because
these cells also synthesize the other complement proteins necessary
for activation.
The complement system plays a role in the clearance of
dead/dying cells through opsonization and promotion of phago￾cytosis (Flierman and Daha, 2007; Trouw et al., 2008). Properdin
released by phagocytes binds to apoptotic and necrotic cells (Kem￾per et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2008), and this may aid in their removal
directly or through properdin-mediated complement activation
(Figure 1). Likewise, local release of properdin may opsonize
and kill microorganisms by directly promoting their phagocytosis
or through properdin-mediated complement opsonization and
killing. Native properdin forms bind directly to C. pneumoniae

Cortes et al. Functions of locally released properdin
FIGURE 1 | Release of properdin in the local microenvironment. Properdin
(P) released by immune cells may directly bind to surfaces (pathogens and
cells) and promote AP complement activation. Properdin may recruit C3b or
C3(H2O) to form a C3 convertase and further promote C3b deposition on
surfaces (P-mediated complement activation). Sources of C3b may be derived
from C3 convertases of the alternative pathway (AP), lectin (LP), or classical
pathways (CP). C3(H2O) derived from “tick over” C3 hydrolysis may also bind
to cell-bound properdin, forming a C3(H2O),Bb convertase on the cell. In
addition, properdin can bind to C3b on surfaces and recruit additional C3b
and factor B, generating new convertases. Properdin that does not encounter
a nearby cell surface may lose the ability to bind to surfaces directly
soon after it is in contact with blood, therefore preventing unwanted
properdin-mediated complement damage in surrounding areas while
keeping the conventional function of stabilizing the C3 and C5 convertases
of the AP. Properdin-mediated complement activation may participate in
opsonization, MAC deposition, and C3a and C5a release, which are important
processes in inflammatory immune responses. Finally, locally released
properdin may carry out functions that are independent from complement
activation/amplification. For simplicity, the orange triangle represents a
properdin trimer.
and promote AP-mediated complement activation, with possible
consequences in infectivity (Cortes et al., 2011) and in chronic
inflammation found in atherosclerosis. Properdin-mediated com￾plement activation may also be important for further recruitment
of pro-inflammatory cells to infection sites. Concomitantly, prop￾erdin may play other direct roles, independent from complement
activation, influencing lipid metabolism (Gauvreau et al., 2012).
At sites of inflammation where many different properdin￾producing cells are in close proximity and cytokine release
and complement activation occurs, neutrophils rapidly secrete
properdin upon degranulation stimuli (Table 1). Endogenous
native properdin has been detected on the surface of iso￾lated, non-stimulated neutrophils (Wirthmueller et al., 1997)
and TNF/fMLP-stimulated neutrophils (Camous et al., 2011),
independently from C3 (Camous et al., 2011). Unfractionated
properdin (known to contain non-physiological complement￾activating aggregates, as described above), when incubated with
isolated resting neutrophils, promotes complement activation on
neutrophil membranes (Camous et al., 2011), and when added to
whole blood, induces the formation of platelet–leukocyte aggre￾gates (Ruef et al., 2008). Interestingly, pro-inflammatory and
coagulation-induced stimuli allow neutrophils to activate the AP
in an autocrine or paracrine fashion, despite the presence of
membrane-bound complement regulatory proteins, on neutrophil
surfaces (Camous et al., 2011). The exact mechanism of comple￾ment activation on neutrophils remains to be determined and

Cortes et al. Functions of locally released properdin
properdin-mediated initiation is possible. Complement activation
on neutrophils results in increased release of complement prod￾ucts such as C5a fragments and the MAC complex which could
further activate neutrophils, endothelial cells, or other cells in
close contact with adherent neutrophils further contributing to a
pro-inflammatory microenvironment.
In vivo studies using properdin-deficient mice have revealed
important roles for properdin in disease models including septic
and non-septic shock (Ivanovska et al., 2008; Stover et al., 2008),
various arthritis models (Dimitrova et al., 2010, 2012; Kimura
et al., 2010), and abdominal aortic aneurism (AAA; Zhou et al.,
2012). Because properdin-deficient mice are protected from the
severity of certain diseases (Ivanovska et al., 2008; Kimura et al.,
2010; Zhou et al., 2012), efforts to understand the consequences
of therapeutically inhibiting properdin (Gupta-Bansal et al., 2000;
Kimura et al., 2010) and the contribution of locally synthesized
properdin in the disease pathogenesis are being evaluated.
POTENTIAL BINDING LIGANDS FOR PROPERDIN ON SURFACES
Properdin is a highly positively charged protein (isoelectric point
>9.5). Properdin may interact directly with surfaces by recog￾nizing glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains of surface proteoglycans
on proximal tubular epithelial cells (Zaferani et al., 2011) and T
cells (Kemper et al., 2008). Candidate sulfated GAGs shown to
interact with properdin include heparin (Yu et al., 2005), hep￾aran sulfate (Kemper et al., 2008; Zaferani et al., 2011), dextran
sulfate (Holt et al., 1990), fucoidan (Holt et al., 1990), and chon￾droitin sulfate (Kemper et al., 2008). Interestingly, Holt et al.
(1990) demonstrated differences between the sulfated glycocon￾jugate binding properties of native and activated (Pn) properdin.
While both native and activated properdin bind to dextran sulfate
(Mr 500,000) and fucoidan, only the“activated”form of properdin
binds to chondroitin sulfate C, heparin, and dextran sulfate (Mr
5,000). Other ligands for properdin on cells include DNA on late
apoptotic and necrotic cells (Xu et al., 2008), and bacterial LPS and
lipooligosaccharide (Kimura et al.,2008). All cell surface molecules
(identified to date), shown to interact directly with properdin on
cells, are negatively charged (with the exception of the convertase
proteins of the AP). Additional studies are needed for identifying
the receptors for properdin on other surfaces on which properdin
has been found to bind, as discussed previously herein.
BINDING OF PROPERDIN TO SURFACES IS REGULATED IN SERUM
Binding of purified physiological forms of properdin to certain
surfaces (zymosan, necrotic cells, and C. pneumoniae) is inhibited
by normal human serum in a dose-dependent manner (Ferreira
et al., 2010a; Cortes et al., 2011). In agreement with these results,
binding of unfractionated pure properdin to apoptotic T cells
was also inhibited in the presence of serum (Kemper et al., 2008),
and direct binding of properdin to zymosan and E. coli was not
detected in the context of normal human serum or lepirudin￾anticoagulated plasma unless C3 components bound first (Harboe
et al., 2012). Therefore, yet-to-be identified inhibitors of this
interaction may exist in serum. Local production of properdin
transiently elevates the concentration in close proximity to the
cells producing it, while properdin that leaves the microenviron￾ment of production will be progressively inhibited as a regulatory
mechanism. Tight regulation of the ability of properdin to bind
to surfaces would be expected in order to prevent unwanted
properdin-mediated complement activation and damage at more
distant/bystander cell surfaces. As mentioned, properdin binds
DNA and sulfated glycoconjugates. Thus, fluid-phase forms of
DNA (Rhodes et al., 2006) or glycoproteins could potentially serve
as regulators of properdin/surface interactions once properdin has
left the microenvironment of the cells producing it (i.e., neu￾trophils). Studies aimed at identifying putative serum-derived
inhibitors of the interaction between properdin and cell surfaces
are necessary.
FINAL REMARKS
The complement system is an essential component of the innate
immune system that participates in elimination of pathogens and
altered host cells. The important role of the local production
of complement components and their role in the inflammatory
microenvironment is an important emerging field. Properdin, the
only known positive regulatory protein of the complement system,
is produced by various cell types. This review describes the role of
properdin as a stabilizer of AP convertases and as a selective pattern
recognition molecule, highlighting its function as an activator of
the AP on surfaces to which it binds (pathogens, host cells). Future
studies aimed at identifying the receptor(s) that bind properdin on
pathogens and host cells, the factors that contribute to regulation
of properdin binding to surfaces in serum, the differences between
serum-derived and leukocyte-derived properdin, and the role of
properdin in the pro-inflammatory microenvironment, specifi￾cally in exacerbating or controlling inflammatory diseases, will
significantly contribute to determining under which scenarios
the therapeutic inhibition of specific properdin functions may be
warranted.
