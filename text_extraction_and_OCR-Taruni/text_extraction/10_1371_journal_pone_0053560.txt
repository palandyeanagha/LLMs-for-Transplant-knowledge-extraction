Abstract
Background: The performance of biomarkers for heart failure (HF) in older residents in long-term care is poorly understood
and has not differentiated between left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) and HF with preserved ejection fraction
(HFpEF).
Methods: This is the first diagnostic accuracy study in this population to assess the differential diagnostic performance and
acceptability of a range of biomarkers against a clinical diagnosis using portable echocardiography. A total of 405 residents,
aged 65–100 years (mean 84.2), in 33 UK long-term care facilities were enrolled between April 2009 and June 2010.
Results: For undifferentiated HF, BNP or NT-proBNP were adequate rule-out tests but would miss one in three cases (BNP:
sensitivity 67%, NPV 86%, cut-off 115 pg/ml; NT-proBNP: sensitivity 62%, NPV 87%, cut-off 760 pg/ml). Using higher test cut￾offs, both biomarkers were more adequate tests of LVSD, but would still miss one in four cases (BNP: sensitivity 76%, NPV
97%, cut-off 145 pg/ml; NT-proBNP: sensitivity 73%, NPV 97%, cut-off 1000 pg/ml). At these thresholds one third of subjects
would test positive and require an echocardiogram. Applying a stricter ‘rule out’ threshold (sensitivity 90%), only one in 10
cases would be missed, but two thirds of subjects would require further investigation. Biomarkers were less useful for HFpEF
(BNP: sensitivity 63%, specificity 61%, cut-off 110 pg/ml; NT-proBNP: sensitivity 68%, specificity 56%, cut-off 477 pg/ml).
Novel biomarkers (Copeptin, MR-proADM, and MR-proANP) and common signs and symptoms had little diagnostic utility.
Conclusions: No test, individually or in combination, adequately balanced case finding and rule-out for heart failure in this
population; currently, in-situ echocardiography provides the only adequate diagnostic assessment.

Introduction
Whilst early, accurate diagnosis and management of heart
failure (HF) may substantially improve prognosis, there is evidence
to suggest that HF is missed in up to half of cases [1–2]. Although
echocardiography is the reference standard for the diagnosis of HF
it does not always provide a definitive result, due to difficulties of
imaging in individual patients, particularly in older, comorbid
populations. Diagnosis ideally requires accurate, accessible, cost￾effective and acceptable alternatives to echocardiography [3].
B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) has been available as a routine
laboratory test since 2003 [4,5], however, there is wide variation in
cut-off levels, and recognition that the optimal threshold may be
age dependent [1,4,6]. A recent European study of nursing-home
residents [1] (n = 150) suggested a cut-off for NT-proBNP of
450 pg/ml (sensitivity 71%, specificity 67%) and BNP 100 pg/ml
(sensitivity 71%, specificity 70%). Other studies suggest cut-offs
ranging from 93–450 pg/ml for NT-proBNP and 40–100 pg/ml
for BNP [1,7,8]. Consequently clinical guidelines provide several

thresholds where chronic HF is unlikely (BNP,100 pg/ml or NT￾proBNP,400 pg/ml) or likely (BNP.400 pg/ml or NT￾proBNP.2000 pg/ml), with a range of uncertainty between
[6,9]. Despite recommendations that natriuretic peptides should
be part of HF diagnostic pathways, their clinical use is relatively
limited [10]. Previous studies have not fully evaluated their clinical
utility in older residents in long-term care and have not
differentiated between types of HF despite the increased preva￾lence of HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) in this
population [3,11–12]. Current cut-offs (based exclusively on
LVSD) may not enable appropriate rule-in or rule-out judge￾ments.
A number of novel biomarkers have possible clinical utility in
HF diagnosis [13–15]. These include mid-regional pro atrial
natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP), mid-regional pro adrenome￾dullin (MR-proADM) and C-terminal provasopressin (Copeptin);
each easily measured using commercially available assays. MR￾proANP was evaluated positively in a European/US study
(n = 1641) as a rule out test for HF using a cut-off value of
120 pmol/L (sensitivity 97%, spec 59.9%, PPV 56%, NPV 97%)
[16]. MR-proADM has been evaluated in the 90-day survival
prognosis of HF with a suggested cut-off value of 1.985 pmol/L
(sensitivity 53%, specificity 76%) [16]. Copeptin has been
investigated in patients with HF following acute myocardial
infarction. A cut-off value of 25.9 pmol/L was established for
predicting one-year mortality (sensitivity 68%, specificity 83%,
PPV 40%, NPV 94%) [17]. In patients with coronary heart
disease, raised high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) is an
independent risk marker for HF [18,19]. Cut-off values for hs￾CRP have been suggested which stratify risk into low (,1 mg/L),
intermediate (1–3 mg/L), high (.3–10 mg/L) [20] and very high
(.10 mg/L) [21] categories. Given the uncertain utility of routine
biomarkers, further evaluation of these easily available, low cost
biomarkers is needed in older, long-term care populations; this is
the first study to do so. Our aim was to determine whether BNP,
NT-pro-BNP, MR-proANP, MR-proADM, Copeptin and
HsCRP could serve as biomarkers for the detection of LVSD
and/or HFpEF in older people in long-term care and whether
appropriate cut off values would differ from those for the general
population.
Methods
Study Population
The cohort for this nested diagnostic accuracy study were
participants in a prevalence study (see [22] for full details) and
randomised controlled trial [23]. Between April 2009 and June
2010, 405 residents aged $65 years without terminal disease were
recruited within 33 care homes in the North East of England. No
exclusions were made on the basis of cognitive capacity,
comorbidities or immobility. We extracted anonymised demo￾graphic details of all eligible residents (including non-participants)
in order to assess their representativeness and thus the potential for
selection bias (see [22] and Figure 1).
Diagnostic Investigation
Each resident underwent a diagnostic assessment in their care
facility, including Mini Mental State Examination [24], demo￾graphic details and past medical history, quality of life assessment
using EuroQol: EQ-5D [25], electrocardiography, echocardiog￾raphy, and blood tests. A doctor conducted the physical
assessment including blood pressure, heart and respiratory rate,
lung signs, displaced apex beat, third heart sound, jugular venous
pressure, peripheral oedema, and New York Heart Association
classification [26].
Portable echocardiograms (Vivid-i, application software version
6.2.0, system software 2.1.16, 3RS probe) were performed by a
British Society of Echocardiography (BSE) accredited physiologist
according to BSE guidelines [27], and electrocardiograms (ECGs;
GE MAC 1600, cardiosoft version 6.5) by a trained phlebotomist.
On completion of the study 50 echocardiograms were randomly
selected and independently reported by an external BSE
accredited cardiac physiologist; 100% agreement on LVSD status
and valvular function was reached. Echocardiograms, ECGs and
clinical assessments were conducted independently and mutually
blinded.
Presence or absence of heart failure
The clinical features, ECG and echocardiogram data were
reviewed by two independent HF specialists (JJM+AF). A diagnosis
of HF was made according to ESC guidelines [6], requiring
objective evidence of a structural or functional abnormality of the
heart at rest in the presence of appropriate symptoms and signs.
Assessment of left ventricular systolic and diastolic function
allowed sub-classification of LVSD and HFpEF [28,29]. If
symptoms and signs were absent but there was left ventricular
systolic dysfunction, LVSD (without HF) was diagnosed [6].
Left ventricular ejection fraction was calculated by Simpson’s
rule and wall motion index using the American Society of
Echocardiography 16 segment model [30]. All patients with
clinical features and either a LVEF of #50% or whose left
ventricular systolic function was assessed by ‘eyeball’ to be mildly,
moderately or severely impaired, were classified as having HF due
to LVSD. Doppler and tissue-doppler measurements of the
longitudinal function of the heart were used to determine left
ventricular diastolic dysfunction. E/E’ measurements were
recorded at both the septum and lateral wall. HFpEF was
diagnosed in accordance with ESC guidelines [31] using clinical,
echocardiographic and BNP measurements. Patients with clinical
features of HF whose LVEF was .50% with E/E’ .15, or those
with an equivocal E/E’ (8–15) but BNP .200 or NT-pro BNP
.220 pg/ml were diagnosed as having HFpEF. Thus reference
standard determinations of LVSD and HFpEF were clinically
determined by interpreting echocardiography findings augmented
with evidence from guidelines.
Assays and sample processing
Blood samples for BNP were drawn into ethylenediaminetetra￾acetic acid-treated tubes, then centrifuged at 2,500 rpm for
10 min and stored at 220uC. Plasma BNP was measured in
batches on a weekly basis with the Siemens Diagnostics Advia
Centaur XP automated immunoassay analyser. The ADVIA
Centaur BNP assay is traceable to an internal standard
manufactured using synthetic human BNP (amino acid 77–108).
The lower limit of detection (analytical sensitivity) for BNP was
,2.0 pg/ml. The intra-assay coefficient of variation was 1.98–
1.26% from 35.27–876.34 pg/ml.
Blood samples for NT-proBNP and hs-CRP were drawn into
serum-separating tubes and for Copeptin, MR-proADM and MR￾proANP into ethylenediaminetetraacetic specimen tubes. Samples
were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes, serum and plasma
aliquoted into secondary tubes 75612 mm polypropylene tubes
(Sarstedt, Leicester, UK) and stored at 280uC. NT-proBNP was
assayed with the Roche Elecsys 2010 (Roche Diagnostics, Lewes,
UK) using the Roche NT-proBNP II electrochemiluminescent
sandwich assay. The analytical range was 5–35000 pg/ml; the
inter-assay and intra-assay variabilities were 4.6–3.8% from 44–

33606 pg/ml and 4.2–2.7% from 44–33606 pg/ml respectively.
Hs-CRP was assayed on the Siemens Advia 2400 Chemistry
analyser (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Frimley, UK) using the
Siemens wide range CRP latex-enhanced immunoturbidimetric
assay. The analytical range for hs-CRP was 0.03–158 mg/L; the
inter-assay and intra-assay variabilities were 4.9–7.8% from 2.25–
49.96 mg/L and 3.2–5.2% from 2.25–49.96 mg/L respectively.
Copeptin, MR-proADM and MR-proANP were assayed on the
Brahms Kryptor Compact analyser (Brahms UK Ltd, Bottisham,
UK), utilising the Time Resolved Amplified Crytate Emission
immunofluorescent assay principle. The analytical range for
Copeptin was 4.8–500 pmol/L; the inter-assay and intra-assay
variabilities were ,15–,8% from 15–20 pmol/L and ,17–,6%
from 2–50 pmol/L respectively. The analytical range for MR￾proADM was 0.05–10 nmol/L; the inter-assay and intra-assay

variabilities were ,20–6% from 0.2–6 nmol/L and ,10–,3.5%
from 0.2–6 nmol/L respectively. The analytical range for MR￾proANP 2.1–1000 pmol/L; the inter-assay and intra-assay vari￾abilities were #6.5% from 10–20 pmol/L and ,4.5–,3.5% from
10–1000 pmol/L respectively.
Data analysis
Descriptive statistics summarised participants’ characteristics,
HF status, and biomarker values. The proportion of correct
diagnoses of LVSD and HFpEF in the biomarker groups were
compared using Fisher’s exact test. Other categorical variables,
expressed as numbers and percentages, were compared using chi￾square tests. Continuous variables were expressed as mean
(standard deviation, range) and compared with an unpaired 2-
sided Student t test when normally distributed. Normality was
determined using the software program SPSS (version 19), using
the Shapiro-Wilk test. Subgroup analysis explored echocardiogra￾phy as the reference standard with and without clinical signs
(including biomarkers) in the diagnosis of HFpEF.
Presence of clinically-assessed (echocardiographically-informed)
LVSD and HFpEF were the principal end-points against which
each diagnostic test was evaluated. Receiver operator curves were
generated for each measure, with area under curve (AUC)
estimates interpreted as a measure of the potential utility of each
test, and test performance explored for optimal predictive values.
‘Optimal’ thresholds were determined as those providing the best
balance of sensitivity and specificity to balance false positive and
negative findings.
Ethics statement
The study complies with the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki; the
study received prior local research management and governance
and national ethics approvals from Leeds West REC (Reference:
08/H1307/96). All participants provided informed consent prior
to participation.
Results
A total of 405 participants were screened, with a mean age of
84.2 y (SD 7.2, range 65–100 y). Of the total, 294 (74%) were
female; all participants were white European; 393 (99%) were
white British. There were four unsuccessful venepuncture attempts
and six participants were excluded because of incomplete
echocardiography data. A total of 399 participants were included
in the final analysis. Study participants and non-participants
showed similar baseline demographic characteristics (see [22]). Of
399 participants, 34 (8.5%) were diagnosed with LVSD: 19 (56%)
mild, 9 (27%) moderate, and 6 (18%) severe; 3 with asymptomatic
LVSD; 57 (14.3%) participants were diagnosed with HFpEF, of
these 46 (81%) had E/E’ .15.
Individual blood test findings
BNP and NTproBNP levels were compared between patients
with heart failure (LVSD or HFpEF) and those without. BNP
values were lower in patients without HF (112 pg/ml, SD 121)
than in patients with LVSD (406 pg/ml SD 413, p = ,0.001), or
in patients with HFpEF (161 pg/ml, SD 107, p = 0.003; see
Table 1). NT-proBNP values were lower in those without HF
(764 pg/ml, SD 1280) than in patients with LVSD (3910 pg/ml,
SD 6065, p = 0.006), or HFpEF (1300 pg/ml, SD 1604,
p = 0.020). Among patients diagnosed with LVSD, BNP and
NTproBNP values were consistently and significantly associated
with disease severity (BNP mean for mild: 270 pg/ml
(p = ,0.001), moderate 680 pg/ml (p = ,0.001) and severe

disease 428 pg/ml (p = ,0.001); NTproBNP mean for mild:
2034 pg/ml (p = 0.037), moderate 8296 pg/ml (p = ,0.001) and
severe disease 3146 pg/ml (p = 0.034)).
Compared with patients without heart failure, novel biomarker
levels for MR-proADM and MR-proANP were statistically
significantly higher in both LVSD (p = 0.013, p = 0.001 respec￾tively) and HFpEP (p = 0.022, p = 0.001 respectively) groups.
Mean differences were non-significant for Copeptin for LVSD
(p = 0.263) and HFpEF groups (p = 0.229).
Using AUC as a screening measure for test utility, BNP (AUC
0.80) and NT-proBNP (AUC 0.78) suggested potentially worth￾while tests for LVSD but not for HFpEF (see Table 1). Although
there were significant differences in mean values for some of the
other biomarkers evaluated, none had adequate potential utility as
tests to diagnose LVSD or HFpEF in this population.
The relationship between BNP and NT-proBNP threshold
values and test accuracy in identifying LVSD (n = 34) is shown in
Figure 2. A BNP threshold value of 145 pg/ml had sensitivity 76%
and specificity 75% (PPV 22%, NPV 97%). A NT-proBNP value
of 1000 pg/ml had sensitivity 73% and specificity 76% (PPV 22%,
NPV 97%). For comparison, published general population cut-off
values [9] are included (BNP: 400 pg/ml; NT-pro BNP: 2000 pg/
ml), and miss more than half of cases of LVSD (sensitivity ,50%).
For LVSD, with BNP at a cut-off of 145 pg/ml, 71% of
participants would test negative and the test would have been
correct (NPV) in 97% of these (see Table 2). Only 29% of subjects
would have been selected for echocardiographic investigation.
However, a test sensitivity of 76% means that one in four cases of
LVSD would be missed; for our study sample, this cut off would
have missed eight patients with LVSD, of whom six had mild, one
moderate and one severe LVSD.
The relationship between Copeptin, MR-proADM, and MR￾proANP cut-off values and test accuracy in identifying LVSD is
shown in Figure 3. Of these novel biomarkers, MR-proANP
performed best, although not as well as BNP or NT-proBNP. A
MR-proANP threshold value of 274 pmol/ml would rule out
LVSD in 70% of subjects (with NPV = 95%) but miss 39% of cases
(sensitivity 61%; see Table 2).
No biomarker provided an accurate test for HFpEF (n = 57)
irrespective of E/E’ diagnostic cut-off. For BNP and NT-proBNP
optimal cut-offs were lower when screening for HFpEF compared
to LVSD (see Table 2). A BNP cut-off of 110 pg/ml would reliably
rule out HFpEF in 58% of subjects (with NPV 95%) but miss one
in three cases (sensitivity 63%). Of the new biomarkers MP￾proANP was most promising: at a cut-off of 218 pmol/ml, MP￾proANP would reliably rule out HFpEF in 55% of subjects (NPV
96%) missing 30% of cases (sensitivity 70%).
For undifferentiated HF (LVSD or HFpEF, n = 91), BNP at a
cut-off of 115 pg/ml, had a sensitivity of 67% and specificity 68%
(PPV 38%, NPV 88%), and would have missed 30 cases (33%, see
Table 2 and Figure 1). A NT-proBNP value of 760 pg/ml had
sensitivity 62% and specificity 75% (PPV 42%, NPV 87%).

Optimisation for ‘rule-out’
Test thresholds were re-evaluated for BNP and NTpro-BNP
requiring 90% sensitivity in detecting LVSD. This was achieved at
thresholds for BNP of 64 pg/ml and NT-pro BNP of 312 pg/ml
(see Figure 2). For both biomarkers 36% of participants would
have tested negative and the test would have been correct (NPV) in
98% of cases. At this threshold only one in 10 subjects with LVSD
would have been missed, however 64% (n = 255) of subjects would
have been referred for echocardiographic investigation.
Individual clinical symptoms and signs
Common symptoms and signs associated with HF were
evaluated; most of these performed inadequately. However, a
normal ECG reliably ruled out LVSD in about half of subjects
(NPV 97%, proportion testing negative 46%) missing only 1 in 7
cases (sensitivity 85%; see Table 2). Previous MI was an unreliable
marker, missing 3 of 4 cases of LVSD (sensitivity 24%) and 9 of 10
cases of HFpEF (sensitivity 12%).
Test combinations
Combinations of ECG, clinical symptoms and signs, BNP and
NT-proBNP and blood markers were investigated; there was no
increase in the balance of diagnostic performance when various
combinations were analysed. A range of test combinations were
explored using ‘abnormal ECG’ as a starting point to reflect
clinical guidelines. Individually, a natriuretic peptide test had a
greater area under the curve than in combination with an
abnormal ECG or other sign or symptom. ECG results did not
increase diagnostic precision if added to a natriuretic peptide test
and clinical assessment (see Table S1 for further details and test
combinations).
Incidental clinical findings
A high proportion of residents had test results outside the
normal range which may have indicated conditions other than HF
(see Table S2). For example, one quarter had raised creatinine;
51% had raised urea; 7% had a raised serum troponin. Other
more definitive diagnoses included two residents whose study
assessment resulted in an urgent referral for a permanent
pacemaker, and one who needed reassessment for a substantially
elevated blood pressure.
Discussion
The study used consultant-interpreted portable echocardiogra￾phy as a reference standard to diagnose HF due to LVSD and
HFpEF in the older long-term care population. Against this
reference a wide range of tests and clinical symptoms and signs
were evaluated for the first time in this older institutionalised
population, including the first formal evaluation of the diagnostic
utility of several novel biomarkers. Diagnostic assessments
(including echocardiogram and venepuncture) were feasible and
acceptable.
BNP and NT-proBNP provided reasonable rule out tests for
LVSD, reducing by about two-thirds the need for referral for
echocardiographic assessment, and may appear cost-effective.
However, by this route one in four patients would be missed,
delaying diagnosis and effective treatment. Our findings indicate
the limited utility of hs-CRP, copeptin, MP-proADM and MP￾proANP in this population. There were no adequate diagnostic
tests for HFpEF [32], which may be an important issue as
consensus for treating HFpEF emerges. Thus sole use of individual
biomarkers may not currently be sufficient for appropriate
decisions about care pathways in this population [33].

For all tests, using lower test thresholds (enhancing ‘rule-in’)
would reduce the number of missed cases of HF but result in
unacceptably large numbers of patients falsely testing positive (thus
requiring echocardiography) meaning that the utility of current
tests is limited. Current NICE guidelines [9] recommend
automatic referral for echocardiography for people with previous
MI and natriuretic peptide screening for those without. The
performance of BNP and NT-proBNP was marginally improved
when limited to residents without previous MI (see Table 2).
Study limitations
The level of heart failure in the study population [LVSD 34/
399; HFpEF 57/399] was modest, and the possibility of missed
heart failure cannot be completely ruled out even with echocar￾diography. Samples were derived from a prevalence study [22];
thus an increase in numbers was not feasible here. While this study
has highlighted the need for differentiation in biomarker cut-offs
for this population, larger scale studies are required to confirm the
performance of these novel and routine biomarkers in this
population.
There is wide variation in previously reported cut-off values for
NT-proBNP and BNP for older people. Used as a rule-out test for
LVSD, our findings suggest NT-proBNP and BNP cut-offs of
1000 pg/ml and 145 pg/ml respectively. These values differ from
those reported by others studying similar populations, which at
93–450 pg/ml for NT-proBNP and from 40–100 pg/ml for BNP
[1,7,8] are more similar to the thresholds in this study for HFpEF
(477 pg/ml and 110 pg/ml respectively). It is possible that
previous studies have included undifferentiated HF (LVSD and
HFpEF), where there is no evidence of a differential diagnosis or
separate cut-off values. The low prevalence of LVSD in this study
(34/399) prevented sub-group evaluation of biomarker perfor￾mance according to gender, age or disease severity. However, rates
of HFpEF were higher than anticipated (57/399). A similar overall
prevalence of HF in our findings and those of others may reflect a
lack of historical differentiation between HFpEF from LVSD. The
high incidence of HFpEF detected suggests the need for further
research in this population, in order to establish clear treatment
guidelines [34].
Participant recruitment was challenging due to organisational
barriers as well as residents’ physical and cognitive limitations.
Nonetheless one third of those approached participated. While
baseline demographics of participants and non-participants were
similar it is possible that non-participation occurred, in part, as a
result of a higher burden of ill-health. We recognise that screening
asymptomatic patients does not reflect routine clinical assessment,
where doctors may attend on the basis of symptoms suggesting HF
or other disease. On-site assessment using echocardiography was
acceptable and feasible to older people in care but remains a time
and resource-intensive option. A simple, definitive test for HF in
this population is elusive. Until such a test emerges, echocardiog￾raphy remains feasible and acceptable to residents, and home￾based access would offer optimal diagnosis when access to other
service configurations may be problematic.
Conclusion
No biomarker test, individually or in combination, adequately
balanced case finding and rule-out for heart failure in this
population; currently, in-situ echocardiography provides the only
adequate diagnostic assessment. Commissioners and policy makers

should consider the routine provision of on-site portable echocar￾diography, particularly if, in addition to LVSD, consensus emerges
about the appropriate treatment of HFpEF.
