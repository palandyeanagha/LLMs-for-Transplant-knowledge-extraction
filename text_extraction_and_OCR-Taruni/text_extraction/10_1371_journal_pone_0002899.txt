Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the deposition of amyloid b-peptide (A-Beta) in the
brain. Transthyretin (TTR) is a tetrameric protein of about 55 kDa mainly produced in the liver and choroid plexus of the brain.
The known physiological functions of TTR are the transport of thyroid hormone T4 and retinol, through binding to the retinol
binding protein. TTR has also been established as a cryptic protease able to cleave ApoA-I in vitro. It has been described that
TTR is involved in preventing A-Beta fibrilization, both by inhibiting and disrupting A-Beta fibrils, with consequent abrogation
of toxicity. We further characterized the nature of the TTR/A-Beta interaction and found that TTR, both recombinant or isolated
from human sera, was able to proteolytically process A-Beta, cleaving the peptide after aminoacid residues 1, 2, 3, 10, 13, 14,16,
19 and 27, as determined by mass spectrometry, and reversed phase chromatography followed by N-terminal sequencing. A￾Beta peptides (1–14) and (15–42) showed lower amyloidogenic potential than the full length counterpart, as assessed by
thioflavin binding assay and ultrastructural analysis by transmission electron microscopy. A-Beta cleavage by TTR was inhibited
in the presence of an aAPP peptide containing the Kunitz Protease Inhibitor (KPI) domain but not in the presence of the
secreted aAPP derived from the APP isoform 695 without the KPI domain. TTR was also able to degrade aggregated forms of A￾Beta peptide. Our results confirmed TTR as a protective molecule in AD, and prompted A-Beta proteolysis by TTR as a
protective mechanism in this disease. TTR may prove to be a useful therapeutic agent for preventing or retarding the cerebral
amyloid plaque formation implicated in AD pathology.

Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is
a brain disorder affecting the elderly and it is one of the causes of
human disability and death in the developed world [1]. Patholog￾ically, this disorder is characterized by intracellular neurofibrillary
tangles, resulting from the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated
microtubule-associated tau, as well as extracellular amyloid deposits
called neuritic or senile plaques [2]; both lesions occur in the central
nervous system, more specifically in the hippocampus and the
cortex. These plaques are primarily composed of a peptide with 40–
42/43 amino acids, amyloid beta peptide (A-Beta) which is formed
through the sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein
(APP) by beta and gamma-secretases [3]. The accumulation of the
peptide can be explained by an imbalance between its production
and its degradation, although much less is known regarding this
latest event [4–6].
The peptide and its precursor (APP) play important roles in
neuronal functions; thus, control of physiological A-Beta levels,
rather than complete inhibition seems to be an important strategy to
reduce the accumulation of neuritic plaques and thus slowing down
the progression of Alzheimer’s disease [7]. Several molecules were
identified and suggested as A-Beta carriers [8,9]. Among them,
transthyretin (TTR) has recently received a large attention [10–13].
TTR is a homotetrameric 55 kDa protein produced mainly in the
liver and in the choroid plexus of the brain and secreted into plasma
and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), respectively [14]. Physiologically, it is
responsible for thyroid hormone and retinol transport, through the
binding of retinol binding protein [15]. More recently, a new
function was attributed to TTR: experiments performed by Liz et al
have demonstrated that TTR is a cryptic protease that cleaves
Apolipoprotein A–I (Apo A–I) at its C-terminal [16,17]. Over 100
TTR mutations have been associated with TTR related amyloid
deposition in Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy, affecting the
peripheral nervous system.
Schwarzman and co-workers used CSF incubated with synthetic
A-Beta (1–40) to identify A-Beta interacting proteins [8]. The
authors concluded that TTR was the major A-Beta binding
protein in CSF. A-Beta interaction with TTR resulted in a
decrease in the aggregation state of the peptide as well as in its
toxicity [8,18]. A sequestration hypothesis was then considered:
normally produced A-Beta is sequestered by certain extracellular
proteins, thereby preventing amyloid formation and A-Beta
cytotoxicity; formation of amyloid and the consequent toxicity
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 August 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 8 | e2899

occurs when sequestration fails [18]. This interaction was further
characterized by our group and the respective Kd was determined
as 2865 nM. WT TTR was observed to interact with all the A￾Beta forms tested (soluble, oligomers and fibrils), with similar
strengths and was able to inhibit the aggregation and disrupt
preformed A-Beta fibrils, behaving as well as a protective molecule
in cell culture through inhibition of apoptosis [19]. In vivo
experiments were performed to investigate the protective effect
of TTR: in Caenorhabditis elegans expressing human A-Beta (1–42),
TTR rescued the neurodegeneration triggered by the toxic peptide
[20]; studies in transgenic mice overexpressing mutant APP
revealed slower disease progression and lack of neurodegeneration
attributed to the increased expression of several neuroprotective
genes, including TTR [11]; in the absence of TTR, A-Beta
deposition was accelerated in transgenic mice models [15,21].
The discussion on TTR/A-Beta interaction and consequent
inhibition of aggregation and toxicity reduction raised the
hypothesis that mutations in the TTR gene or conformational
changes in the protein induced by aging, could affect the
sequestration properties. However, no mutations in the TTR
gene have been found in AD patients [22]. Recent work
investigated binding of A-Beta to several TTR variants; TTR
variants with high amyloidogenic potential bound poorly, whereas
more stable variants had a higher affinity for A-Beta [19].
The total A-Beta burden is a balance between production and
accumulation; besides sequestration, clearance is also achieved by
catabolic processing of the peptide. Proteases, acting in multiple
cellular compartments, are important to degrade the peptide [7].
These include Neprilysin (NEP), Insulin degrading enzyme (IDE),
Endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE), angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE), uPA/tPA-plasmin system, cathepsin D, and
matrix metalloendopeptidase 9 [4,23]. NEP and IDE are
metalloproteases widely expressed in many normal tissues; in the
brain they are localized in areas vulnerable to amyloid deposition.
NEP is able to cleave not only monomeric but also oligomeric A￾Beta forms both localized intracellularly and extracellularly. The
role of these enzymes in A-Beta degradation was confirmed by in
vitro and in vivo studies [7,24,25]. These studies confirmed
diminished A-Beta deposition, when enzymes were overexpressed;
levels of mRNA and expressed enzymes significantly decreased in
AD brains, specifically in regions most vulnerable to AD, as
compared with healthy controls [24].
In this work, we investigated mechanisms underlying TTR
protection against A-Beta aggregation and toxicity, and showed
that A-Beta is processed proteolytically by TTR, resulting in
smaller less amyloidogenic peptides.
Materials and Methods
A-Beta peptides
A-Beta peptides (1–42) and (1–40) from BioSource and A-Beta
peptides (1–14) and (15–42) synthesized at Rpeptide were
dissolved in hexafluorisopropanol (HFIP) and kept at room
temperature for 1–2 hours. The HFIP was then removed under
a stream of nitrogen until a clear film remained in the
microcentrifuge tube. The residue was then dissolved in DMSO
at 2 mM.
TTR production and purification
Human recombinant TTRs were produced in a bacterial
expression system using Escherichia coli BL21 [26] and purified as
previously described [27]. Briefly, after growing the bacteria, the
protein was isolated and purified by preparative gel electrophoresis
after ion-exchange chromatography. The same protocol was used to
isolate TTR from human serum: serum was dialysed against 50 mM
phosphate buffer and 77 mM NaCl (pH 7.6) and chromatographed
on an ion-exchange DEAE-cellulose column. The protein was eluted
by increasing ion strength. The TTR fraction was then re￾chromatographed in a gel-filtration column. Protein concentration
was determined using the Lowry method [28].
A-Beta cleavage products by TTR analysed by SDS-PAGE
and imunoblot
Human, recombinant or sera, TTR (15 mg) and A-Beta peptide
(1–42) (2 mg) were incubated in 20 ml 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, at
37uC for different periods of time, and then reactions were applied
onto a 15% SDS-PAGE gel and visualized by coomassie blue
staining. Alternatively, TTR incubated with A-Beta (1–42) and A￾Beta alone, were run on a SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes, and A-Beta immunodetected using an
anti-A-Beta antibody (BAM-10, Sigma). In another set of
experiments, A-Beta was incubated for 6 hours at 37uC for
aggregation purposes and then subsequently incubated with TTR.
Results were visualized by immunoblot, as described above.
To evaluate possible inhibitors of A-Beta proteolysis by TTR,
recombinant TTR (15 mg) was pre-incubated for 30 minutes at
37uC, either with 1 mM pefabloc, 0.33 mM aAPP of peptide
encompassing aminoacids 18–688, containing the KPI domain
(Neuromics) or with 0.33 mM aAPP peptide derived from the APP
isoform 695 (without the KPI domain) (Sigma), both formed by a
a-secretase cleavage. Then, A-Beta was added (2 mg) in a final
volume of 20 ml, and further incubated for 6 hours at 37uC.
Results were observed by immunoblot as described. Experiments
were repeated at least twice.
Analysis of A-Beta cleavage products
Mass spectrometry. For analysis of A-Beta cleavage
products, a fresh mixture of TTR (30 mg) and A-Beta (4 mg)
reaction was submitted to molecular weight determination by
MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry (Applied Biosystems 4700
Proteomics Analyzer). For control experiments, albumin (Sigma)
or gelsolin (Sigma) was incubated with A-Beta peptide and
analyzed as above. To determine the amino sequence of newly
observed peaks, MS/MS peptide de novo sequencing using a
specific software program (Applied Biosystems DeNovo Explorer)
was performed.
Reversed Phase chromatography. A-Beta (40 mg),
recombinant TTR (192 mg) and mixtures of the two were
incubated in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, at 37uC, for different periods
of time. The reactions were stopped by diluting mixtures with 1%
aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to obtain a final A-Beta
concentration of 19 mM. A-Beta and fragments were resolved by
reversed-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) using an AKTA¨ purifier 10
(GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB) with a LichroCart 250-4
Lichospher 100 RP-18 (Merck) pre-equilibrated in buffer A
(0.1% TFA in water). The elution occurred with a 0–60% B
(0.1%TFA in acetonitrile) gradient over 10 column volumes. The
flow rate was 1 ml/min and elution was monitored by absorbance
at 206 nm. Half minute fractions were collected (Frac-920, GE
Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB) and peaks were analyzed by mass
spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing.
Thioflavin T (Th T) binding assay. 100 mg of each peptide
were diluted in F12 media at 100 mM and incubated at 37uC for
different periods of time. Excitation spectra were recorded on a
Jasco FP-770 spectrofluorometer at 25uC with 30 mM Th T
(Fluka) in 50 mM glycine/NaOH buffer, pH 9.0 in a 1-ml assay
volume. Results were presented by plotting the intensity of
fluorescence at 450 nm which is the characteristic novel excitation

maxima formed upon Th T binding. Experiments were repeated
at least twice.
Transmission Electon Microscopy (TEM). A-Beta (1–14),
(15–42) and (1–42) peptides from a 2 mM stock were diluted to
100 mM in F12 media (Gibco BRL) and incubated at 37uC for 5
days; to analyze the action of the aAPP peptide containing the
KPI domain (Neuromics) and the aAPP peptide derived without
the KPI domain on the inhibitory effect of TTR on A-Beta
aggregation, each peptide (0.33 mM) was pre-incubated with TTR
(10 mM) for 30 min; then A-Beta (100 mM) was added and the
mixture further incubated for 15 hours at 37uC.
For visualization by TEM, sample aliquots were absorbed to
glow-discharged, carbon-coated collodion film supported on 200-
mesh copper grids, and negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate.
The grids were exhaustively visualized with a Zeiss microscope
(model EM10C), operated at 60 kV. Experiments were repeated at
least twice.
Statistical analyses. All data examined were expressed as
mean6S.E. Comparison between groups was made using the
Student’s t test. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Results
TTR cleaves A-Beta
We have previously shown that TTR binds A-Beta, inhibits its
aggregation and consequently abrogates its toxicity [19]. To
characterize the nature of the protective role of TTR on A-Beta
toxicity and since TTR has proteolytic activity [16], we
hypothesized that TTR could cleave A-Beta and thus, contribute
to its clearance. By SDS-PAGE analysis, we observed that the
band corresponding to the A-Beta (1–42) monomer was less
intense in preparations of recombinant TTR incubated with A￾Beta (1–42) as compared with A-Beta incubated alone (Figure 1).
Similar experiments carried out with A-Beta (1–40) peptide
resulted in analogous observations (not shown). This prompted
our attention to the possibility of proteolytic phenomena. We
could not detect new bands in the gel, corresponding to putative
generated fragments, which can be explained by the small size of
cleavage products.
Kinetics studies showed that this effect was evident as early as
1 hour of co-incubation, increasing with time (Figure 1, top left
panel). To verify the identity of the weaker band, we performed
western blot followed by immunodetection using an A-Beta
specific antibody (Figure 1, bottom left panel) and we confirmed
that the weaker band was immunoreactive. At this point we also
assayed different TTR batches to further validate the ability of
TTR at cleaving the A-Beta peptide, excluding the possibility of
being a feature of a single TTR batch, or of contaminants present
in a particular preparation; in all cases, co-incubation of TTR with
A-Beta resulted in a weaker A-Beta monomer band, when
compared with A-Beta incubated alone (not shown).
To further explore this hypothesis and exclude the possibility of
contaminants associated to the protocol of recombinant protein
purification from bacteria, incubation of A-Beta (1–42) with
human TTR isolated from serum was performed. Results are
displayed in Figure 1 and support the above results, since the
amount of A-Beta in the preparation incubated with TTR is lower
than in the preparation of A-Beta alone. The kinetics followed the
trend observed with recombinant TTR either detected by
coomassie blue staining (Figure 1, top right panel) or by
immunodetection (Figure 1, bottom right panel); TTR from
different donors produced the same effect (not shown).
Identification of the cleavage site on A-Beta peptide
To further characterize A-Beta proteolytic processing by TTR,
and establish the cleavage site or sites in A-Beta (1–42), we started
by determining the molecular weight of proteins/peptides present
in preparations after 3 hours incubation, using both recombinant
and serum TTR. We observed a new peak of 1698 Da in the
TTR/A-Beta (1–42) mixture whereas in the separate A-Beta (1–
42) and TTR preparations only the expected 4517 Da and
13745 Da peaks were observed, respectively (Figure 2A). Control
experiments were performed using preparations of A-Beta co￾incubated with albumin which did not reveal any new peak (not
shown). Gelsolin, a known A-Beta ligand was also assessed and
failed to generate new A-Beta peaks (not shown). The aminoacid
sequence of the new peptide was determined by de novo sequencing
of the 1698 Da peak which revealed the first 14 aminoacids of the
A-Beta peptide sequence. Analysis of 15 hours incubations
revealed the 1698 Da peak and in addition peaks of 1010, 1562
and 1955 Da (not shown). Although we could not perform de novo
sequencing on these three peaks, they probably correspond to
aminoacids 3–10, 1–13 and 1–16, respectively, accordingly to the
Figure 1. Kinetics of A-Beta proteolysis by TTR. 2 mg of A-Beta were incubated alone (2) or in the presence of 15 mg of human TTR (+), either
isolated from sera (right panels) or recombinant (left panels), for different periods of time: 1 hour (1 hr), 3 hours (3 hrs), 6 hours (6 hrs) and
15 hours(15 hrs), at 37uC. Visualization was performed either by staining the SDS-PAGE gel with Coomassie Blue (upper panels) or by western blot of
the gel using an antibody specific for A-Beta (lower panels). Bands corresponding to the TTR and A-Beta (1–42) monomers are indicated by arrows
(left side) as well as the molecular weight standards used (right side); TTR incubated for 15 hrs at 37uC was also run on the gel (TTR); MW- molecular

results obtained using the Isotopident program (http://education.
expasy.org/student_projects/isotopident/htdocs/).
Amyloidogenecity of new A-Beta peptides
We next evaluated amyloidogenecity of the smaller generated
peptides as compared to A-Beta (1–42), by Th T binding studies and
by TEM ultrastructural analysis. The fragment (1–14) failed to bind
Th T and to produce the new characteristic peak at 450 nm, even
after 24 hours at 37uC (Figure 3A). A-Beta (15–42) showed
aggregation properties as significant binding to Th T was observed,
although less intense than that of full-length peptide.
Ultrastructural studies depicted in Figure 3B corroborated the
Th T assays since no fibrils were detected by TEM in the A-Beta
(1–14) preparation; A-Beta (15–42) retained the ability to
aggregate, but fibrils were shorter and less abundant than in the
preparation of A-Beta (1–42). Taken together, these results showed
that A-Beta amyloidogenecity is diminished upon cleavage by
TTR.
Reversed phase chromatography
In an attempt to identify additional A-Beta cleavage sites
corresponding to fragments failing to ionize, we analyzed, by
reversed phase chromatography, A-Beta and A-Beta/TTR
preparations incubated for different periods of time. Figure 4
shows the chromatographic profiles obtained after 3, 6 and
15 hours. After 3 hours incubation, 3 peaks were identified: peaks
a, b and c (Figure 4A, lower chromatograms), as compared with
the A-Beta alone profile (Figure 4A, upper chromatograms); the
intensities of these peaks increased over-time. Peaks marked with
an asterisk, also present in preparations corresponding to A-Beta
alone, increased with time, probably due to aggregation of A-Beta;
for the same time-point these peaks decreased with TTR.
N-terminal sequence performed for 5–6 cycles in fractions
corresponding to peaks a, b and c, revealed A-Beta cleaved
between aminoacids 19–20 in peak a; A-Beta cleaved between
aminoacids 1–2 and 3–4 in peak b; peak c revealed the first 5
aminoacids of the A-Beta peptide sequence. Peak c could represent
a new A-Beta aggregation state or a peptide cleaved after position
5. Mass spectrometry analysis of this fraction showed a peak of
3094 Da (Figure 2B), suggesting another cleaving site between
aminoacids 27–28. Figure 4B shows the A-Beta (1–42) aminoacid
sequence and the cleavage sites of A-Beta by various enzymes
including NEP (N), IDE (I), ACE (A), ECE (E), plasmin (P), as
previously described [25], and TTR (T) as determined in this
work.
APP peptides with the KPI domain inhibit A-Beta (1–42)
cleavage by TTR
TTR is a cryptic protease able to cleave Apo A-1 and this
cleavage is inhibited by PMSF, Pefabloc, and others [16] and thus
we tested if A-Beta proteolytic processing by TTR was also
inhibited by the same molecules. Analysis of A-Beta after
incubation with TTR in the presence or absence of Pefabloc
was investigated by immunoblot (Figure 5A). Densitometry
analysis indicated an inhibition of TTR proteolytic activity of
approximately 52% by pefabloc (Figure 5B). APP isoforms with

peptide. B- Fraction corresponding to peak c of A-Beta incubated with TTR for 15 hours at 37uC, and subjected to RP-HPLC, and also analyzed by

the KPI domain are associated with increased A-Beta deposition
[29]. To gain insights into the proteolytic mechanism by which
TTR cleaves and protects against A-Beta toxicity, we tested the
ability of 2 APP peptides formed by a-secretase cleavage to block
A-Beta (1–42) cleavage by TTR. Analysis of the results was
performed by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunodetection, and is
shown in figure 5A. One of the peptides derived from the 770
isoform and containing the KPI domain partially abolished
proteolysis of A-Beta by TTR, by approximately 15%
(Figure 5B). The other used peptide, derived from the APP
isoform 695 without KPI domain, did not inhibit A-Beta
proteolysis by TTR; on the contrary, it seemed to favor cleavage
of the peptide (Figures 5A and B). Structural analysis by TEM,
depicted in Figure 5C, showed that the previously described
inhibition of A-Beta aggregation by TTR [19] is abrogated by the
presence of KPI-containing peptide but not by the KPI-lacking
peptide, thus establishing proteolysis as the mechanism underlying
inhibition of A-Beta fibrillization by TTR.
TTR cleaves aggregated forms of A-Beta
We have previously shown that TTR binds to different A-Beta
species namely soluble, oligomeric and fibrillar A-Beta. Further￾more, besides inhibiting its aggregation, TTR is also capable of
disaggregating A-Beta mature fibrils [19]. In this line of thought,
we next evaluated the possibility of TTR cleaving other forms of
A-Beta and for that we analyzed the preparations by western blot.
In this case, previously to the incubation with TTR, A-Beta
peptide was incubated alone for aggregation purposes, and then
further incubated in the presence or absence of TTR for another
3 hours. Results were visualized by western blot after separation
under denaturing conditions, displayed in Figure 6 and showed
that A-Beta higher molecular forms were also diminished in the
samples containing TTR, implying that TTR also degrades
aggregated forms of A-Beta.
Discussion
TTR has been suggested as an A-Beta carrier [8–10,18] and
attempts to relate TTR levels and Alzheimer’s disease have been
made [30,31]. Very recently, proteolytic activity has been
attributed to TTR as a novel physiological function [16]. In this
work, authors showed that TTR has a chymotrypsin-like serine
protease activity, capable of cleaving apoA-1 in vitro. No other
substrates were identified yet. Proteolysis has been viewed as an
important event in most types of amyloidosis. On one side, in some
cases, the amyloidogenic proteins/peptides are released from
precursors by proteolysis. Examples include the A-Beta peptide
[32,33], the 34-residue Abri peptide [34,35], the 50-residue medin
peptide [36] and others [37]. On the other side, proteolysis can
function to protect, providing a way for clearance of the
amyloidogenic proteins/peptides. It is the case of A-Beta peptide
degradation by several enzymes that participate in A-Beta
catabolism, which include neprilysin, insulin-degrading enzyme
(IDE), endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE) and angiotensin￾converting enzyme (ACE), metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and
plasmin [25]. Many of them have more than one cleavage site
in A-Beta [25], (see figure 4B).
Here we showed that TTR also cleaves A-Beta (1–42) and
several cleavage sites were identified. Proteolysis occurred after
bulky hydrophobic amino acid residues as tyrosine, and phenyl￾alanine; after positively-charged amino acid residues as lysine;
after small neutral amino acid residues as alanine; but also after
other aminoacid residues as aspartic acid, glutamic acid, histidine
and asparagine, which are not part of the common aminoacid
residues used by serine proteases. Nevertheless, cleavage after the
negatively charged glutamic acid and after an aspartic acid has
been described for serine proteases [38]: Staphylococcal exfoliative
toxins A and B cleave the peptide b-melanocyte-stimulating
hormone after specific glutamic acid residues; the crystal structure
of the toxins also indicated that the enzyme probably also cleaves
after an aspartic acid, and other residues as histidines and
asparagines were also identified. Several of these TTR cleaving
sites are also sites for other A-Beta degrading enzymes, suggesting
these are aminoacid residues in A-Beta prone to proteolysis. A￾Beta degradation by TTR, together with the action of other A￾Beta degrading enzymes, will contribute to its clearance; the newly
generated peptides can be eliminated by the cells as they are not
toxic or not as toxic as the 1–42 peptide precursor. Since A-Beta
(15–42) can be further cleaved by TTR in smaller peptides, it is
expected to lose its partial amyloidogenic potential. This finding
together with the demonstrated protection of TTR against A-Beta
toxicity, as assessed by caspase-3 activation, previously described
[19], is suggestive of proteolysis as one possible mechanism of
TTR protection in AD.
It has been reported that A-Beta generated in the brain can be
bound to cholesterol/apoE and in this way cross the blood brain
barrier (BBB), to be further incorporated in HDL for delivery in
the liver [39]; thus, it was important to assess A-Beta cleavage by
TTR in sera; our results demonstrated that isolated sera TTR was
able to cleave A-Beta peptide (1–42), therefore indicating that A￾Beta can be cleaved by TTR also in the liver and/or sera.
Our results indicated that TTR has also a proteolytic effect on
aggregated A-Beta as analyzed by western blot. This, together with
previous findings showing that TTR was able to bind and disrupt
A-Beta fibrils [19], suggests that, in vivo, TTR can also develop its
proteolytic activity on A-Beta deposits. TTR has been localized
within senile plaques [12,40] in AD, either in clinical samples and
animal models. In this way, TTR contributes not only to the
maintenance of A-Beta levels within normal range but also to the
removal of deposited A-Beta in case of imbalance and disease, as it
seems to be the case of other A-Beta degrading enzymes such as
neprilysin [24].
Figure 6. Influence of TTR in A-Beta aggregates. A-Beta alone was
incubated for 3 hours at 37uC to form aggregates and then further
incubated with or without TTR for another 3 hours. Analysis was done
by western blot following separation under denaturing conditions.
Results indicated that in preparations of A-Beta incubated with TTR,
both bands corresponding to A-Beta monomer and to the higher
molecular form presented decreased intensities, as compared to the
same bands in the A-Beta alone preparation.

TTR Cleaves A-Beta Peptide
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 August 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 8 | e2899

APP is presented at least in three isoforms resulting from
alternative splicing [41]. The isoform 695 is predominantly
generated in neuronal cells whereas isoforms 751 and 770 are
more abundant in astroglial cells and contain a KPI domain [42].
Curiously, these two isoforms are associated with increased A-Beta
deposition [29] and the respective mRNAs are increased in AD
brains [41]. It has been already suggested that this may be related
to the inhibitory effect of KPI on serine proteases [43]. In fact,
other reports describe that KPI-containing APP isoforms regulate
extracellular cleavage of secreted aAPP [41], resulting in increased
A-Beta (1–42) production [44]. Here, we showed that TTR ability
to cleave A-Beta peptide (1–42) was inhibited in the presence of an
aAPP secreted form (aminoacids 18–688) containing the referred
domain, supporting the idea of a TTR protective role via
proteolysis. Unexpectedly, the aAPP peptide derived from an
isoform lacking the KPI domain, not only did not inhibit TTR
proteolytic activity but on the contrary, facilitated the cleavage.
Secreted aAPP has been described as neuroprotector, both in vivo
and in vitro [12] and in this context the KPI-containing isoform
should also provide for protection. However, a careful analysis of
the literature indicates that in most studies, including AD mouse
models, the APP isoform used was the 695 one, thus lacking the
KPI domain. Therefore, one can hypothesize that aAPP forms
which are neuroprotective derive solely from the APP isoforms
without the KPI domain, and that the mechanism underlying
neuroprotection involves increasing A-Beta degradation and
clearance. Other reports describe that genetic reduction of TTR
increases A-Beta steady-state levels in the brain, both soluble and
detergent extractable, but does not alter APP processing [13].
Therefore, A-Beta peptide elevation levels found in this model can
result from deficient clearance due to decreased proteolysis by
TTR.
In summary, here we showed for the first time that TTR cleaves
A-Beta and identified several cleavage sites. At this point we
cannot rule out the possibility of other cleaving sites. TTR also
inhibits A-Beta fibrillogenesis and toxicity and thus, we hypoth￾esized that A-Beta proteolysis by TTR contributes to its clearance
as the amyloidogenic potential of the new peptide generated is null
or lower than that of the full-length peptide. We also demonstrated
that the referred cleavage is abolished by an APP peptide
containing the KPI domain. This result can explain, at least
partially, the increased A-Beta deposition in sites related to APP
isoforms containing the KPI domain, since TTR proteolytic
activity is probably inhibited under these circumstances. Cells with
abundant APP isoforms lacking the KPI domain, facilitate TTR
activity and thus, have less or no A-Beta deposition.
Targeting A-Beta clearance represents a potential therapeutic
avenue for patients with AD; A-Beta degrading proteases-based
therapies represent an alternative approach in controlling A-Beta
clearance. It is known that TTR is decreased in the CSF of AD
patients [30] and thus TTR may prove to be a useful therapeutic
agent for preventing or retarding the cerebral amyloid plaque
formation implicated in AD pathology.
