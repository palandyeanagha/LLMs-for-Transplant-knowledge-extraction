Gas exchange in the lung occurs within alveoli, air-filled sacs composed of type 2 and type 1 epithelial cells 
(AEC2s and AEC1s), capillaries, and various resident mesenchymal cells. Here, we use a combination of in vivo 
clonal lineage analysis, different injury/repair systems, and in vitro culture of purified cell populations to obtain 
new information about the contribution of AEC2s to alveolar maintenance and repair. Genetic lineage-tracing 
experiments showed that surfactant protein C–positive (SFTPC-positive) AEC2s self renew and differentiate over 
about a year, consistent with the population containing long-term alveolar stem cells. Moreover, if many AEC2s 
were specifically ablated, high-resolution imaging of intact lungs showed that individual survivors undergo rapid 
clonal expansion and daughter cell dispersal. Individual lineage-labeled AEC2s placed into 3D culture gave rise 
to self-renewing “alveolospheres,” which contained both AEC2s and cells expressing multiple AEC1 markers, 
including HOPX, a new marker for AEC1s. Growth and differentiation of the alveolospheres occurred most 
readily when cocultured with primary PDGFRα+ lung stromal cells. This population included lipofibroblasts 
that normally reside close to AEC2s and may therefore contribute to a stem cell niche in the murine lung. Results 
suggest that a similar dynamic exists between AEC2s and mesenchymal cells in the human lung.
Introduction
The lung is a complex organ with a large and highly vascularized 
epithelial surface area. Efficient gas exchange and host defense 
rely on the integrity of this epithelium and its dynamic interac￾tion with surrounding mesenchyme. Lung cell turnover is nor￾mally slow compared with other adult organs such as the skin and 
intestine. However, significant regeneration and repair are possible 
after physiologic insults, including pneumonectomy and severe 
respiratory infection (1–4). Understanding the regenerative capac￾ity of the lung and the role of resident stem and progenitor cells is 
therefore of considerable practical and therapeutic interest.
Here, we focus on the maintenance and repair of the distal gas 
exchange region of the lung that is composed of millions of alveoli 
organized into hundreds of clusters or acini (5). Each alveolus con￾tains cuboidal type 2 epithelial cells (AEC2s) expressing high levels 
of surfactant protein C (SFTPC) and very thin type 1 cells (AEC1s) 
in close apposition to capillaries. Several pathologic conditions 
disrupt the delicate architecture of the alveoli — with loss of num￾bers in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (6) and 
their obliteration in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) (7). Data 
suggest that these pathologies are triggered in part by defects in 
the alveolar epithelium; increased apoptosis and senescence have 
been described in COPD (8, 9), and mutations associated with 
abnormal surfactant protein processing and ER stress have been 
reported in IPF and hereditary fibrotic lung disease (reviewed in 
ref. 10). These defects are thought to promote disease by reduc￾ing the normal reparative capacity of the alveolar epithelium, but 
precise information about underlying mechanisms is still lacking.
Historical data from simian and rodent models suggested that 
SFTPC+ AEC2s function as progenitor cells in the alveoli and pro￾liferate and differentiate into AEC1s (11, 12). Our recent genet￾ic lineage-tracing studies in the mouse clearly established that 
SFTPC+ AEC2s, as a population, proliferate in vivo and give rise to 
AEC1s (13). These data also showed that these processes, which are 
normally quite slow, are stimulated after injury with bleomycin, a 
chemotherapeutic agent that damages multiple cell types in the 
alveoli and induces transient inflammation and fibrosis (14).
In spite of this progress, many important questions remain 
regarding the identity, behavior, and regulation of alveolar epithe￾lial progenitors. For example, do SFTPC+ AEC2s have the capac￾ity to undergo self renewal and differentiation over many months, 
thereby meeting the definition of long-term tissue stem cells? To 
what extent are they replaced by descendants of SFTPC-negative 
cells during repair after alveolar damage or viral infection? Are 
SFTPC+ AEC2s a heterogeneous population composed of cells with 
different capacities for quiescence, proliferation, and differentia￾tion? And finally, what makes up the niche in which AEC2s reside?
Similar questions have been posed for epithelial stem cells in 
other organ systems such as the skin and gut. In these cases, impor￾tant insights have come from studies using a combination of in vivo 
clonal lineage analysis, different injury/repair systems, and in vitro 
culture of purified cell populations (15–17). Here, we apply similar 
strategies to epithelial progenitors in the distal lung. For lineage￾tracing AEC2s, we have used our Sftpc-CreERT2 allele (13) in which 
a cassette encoding tamoxifen-activated (Tmx-activated) CreER is 
inserted into the endogenous Sftpc locus. To assay the reparative 
behavior of AEC2s, we have used both the bleomycin injury model 
and a new cell ablation model of alveolar damage in which no 
fibrosis occurs. We have coupled this model with high-resolution

imaging to follow the expansion and fate of AEC2 clones in the 
repairing lung. Finally, we show for what we believe is the first time 
that individual lineage-labeled AEC2s can self renew in culture and 
differentiate into alveolar-like structures (“alveolospheres”) that 
contain both mature AEC2s and cells expressing AECI markers. 
This is achieved by coculture with a PDGFRA+ mesenchymal popu￾lation that includes LipidTOX+ lipofibroblasts that normally reside 
in proximity to AEC2 cells in vivo. We present evidence suggest￾ing that a similar mesenchymal-epithelial dynamic exists between 
HTII-280+ (18) AEC2s and stromal cells in the human lung.
Results
Sftpc-CreERT2 lineage labels AEC2s in the adult lung. To lineage label 
adult AEC2s, Sftpc-CreERT2;Rosa26R-tdTm (where Tm indicates 
Tomato) double heterozygous mice (abbreviated Sftpc-CreER;Rosa￾Tm) were given 4 doses of Tmx (0.2 mg/g body weight) and sacri￾ficed at least 4 days after the final injection. As previously reported, 
this leads to lineage labeling of approximately 85% of SFTPC+ cells 
(13). Immunohistochemistry, location, and cell morphology con￾firmed that the great majority (99.5% ± 0.02%) of these cells were 
AEC2s, while 0.3% ± 0.07% were dual￾positive SFTPC+;SCGB1A1+ cuboidal 
cells in the terminal bronchioles. Very 
few remaining cells (0.2% ± 0.06%) 
were SFTPCneg;SCGB1A1+ airway cells 
that were presumably labeled during 
development (Figure 1, A and B).
AEC2s as a population undergo long￾term self renewal and give rise to small 
clones. To determine whether SFTPC+
AEC2s undergo long-term self renewal 
in the adult lung, we lineage labeled a 
population of these cells by injecting 
a cohort of 8- to 12-week-old Sftpc￾CreER;Rosa-Tm mice with 2 doses of 
TMX (0.25 mg/g). We then asked 
whether the proportion of lineage￾labeled SFTPC+ AEC2s remained con￾stant over time or decreased, as would 
be expected if a non–lineage-labeled 
population (either SFTPC expressing 
or not) were to expand preferentially 
to renew and repair the alveolar epi￾thelium. As shown in Figure 1C, the 
proportion of lineage-labeled SFTPC+
AEC2s remained constant over the 
48-week chase period (87.9% ± 2.7% 
at 1 week; 86.5% ± 4.5% at 12 weeks; 
83.5% ± 8.5% at 24 weeks; 82.3% ± 8.4% 
at 36 weeks; 82.1 ± 7.0% at 48 weeks; 
P = NS for all times). We confirmed 
by Ki67 staining that proliferation 
of lineage-labeled AEC2s continued 
throughout the chase (Figure 1E). A 
few lineage-labeled AEC1s were also 
seen over time (Supplemental Figure 
1A; supplemental material available 
online with this article; doi:10.1172/
JCI68782DS1), supporting the con￾clusion that AEC2s not only self renew 
but slowly differentiate during steady-state tissue maintenance.
To test for Tmx-independent recombination of the reporter, a 
cohort of adult SftpcCreER;Rosa-Tm littermates was treated with 
corn oil vehicle alone. At 12 to 48 weeks, recombination was 
observed in only a small number of SFTPC+ cells (5%–9%) (Fig￾ure 1C). Their low density enabled us to see that lineage-labeled 
SFTPC+ cells were often present in small clusters (Figure 1D), con￾sistent with a slow rate of self renewal at steady state.
To further explore the clonal expansion of AEC2s, we exploited 
the Rosa-Confetti multicolor lineage-tracing allele (19). Adult Sftpc￾CreER;Rosa-Confetti double-heterozygous mice (n = 3) were injected 
once with Tmx (0.1 mg/g) to label only a small proportion of 
AEC2s. After approximately 7 months (30 weeks), small clusters of 
lineage-labeled AEC2s of like colors were observed (Supplemental 
Figure 1B), providing strong evidence for clonal proliferation of 
AEC2s during long-term homeostasis.
SCGB1A1+ cells, but not another Sftpcneg population, contribute to AEC2 
replacement after bleomycin injury. Although the proportion of lin￾eage-labeled SFTPC+ AEC2s did not change during steady state, 
our previous studies and those of others had shown a decline in

were dosed ×4 with Tmx (0.2 mg/g). Tiled confocal images of lung sections 4 dpi show (A) that all Tm+
cells express SFTPC. The majority locate in alveoli and resemble AEC2s. No label is seen in bronchi/
bronchioles (Br), indicating that the Sftpc-CreER allele is not active in proximal epithelial precursors 
in the absence of Tmx. (B) Tm+ epithelial cells in the BADJ coexpress SFTPC and SCGB1A1. Insets

purple; SFTPC, green). (C) A cohort of 8- to 12-week-old mice was dosed ×2 with 0.25 mg/g Tmx. 
Controls received vehicle alone. At different dpi, confocal z-stack images of lung sections (n ≥ 3 mice 
per point, 6 sections/mouse) were analyzed to give the proportion of SFTPC+ cells with lineage label. 
This does not significantly decline over the 48-week chase (red circles). Low recombination was seen 
without Tmx (black circles). (D) Section from a 24-week-old Tmx– control mouse from C showing

labeling index after injury of the lung by bleomycin (13, 20). This 
suggested that a cell type that is negative for SFTPC (or expresses 
only low levels of the gene) helps to restore the AEC2 population 
during certain types of lung repair. Potential identities of this 
progenitor include secretory cells expressing the gene Secretoglo￾bin1a1 (SCGB1A1; CC10; CCSP) in the terminal bronchioles (13, 
21–23), cells in the alveoli enriched for integrin α6β4 (20), AEC1 
cells, which may proliferate after injury (24), or another as yet 
unidentified facultative stem cell population.
To address this question, we first confirmed that the proportion 
of lineage-labeled SFTPC+ AEC2s does indeed decline in fibrotic 
areas of the lung at 21 days after bleomycin injury (intratracheal 
delivery of 1.25 U/kg). The control proportion of lineage-labeled 
SFTPC+ AEC2s in Sftpc-CreER;Rosa-Tm mice that received saline is 
82.5% ± 2.0% (mean ± SEM; n = 4 mice); this proportion declined 
to 34.7% ± 8.7%; P = 0.002 (n = 4 mice) in fibrotic areas after bleo￾mycin (Figure 2, A and C).
Previous work has shown that SCGB1A1+ cells can give rise to 
AEC2s and AEC1s following bleomycin lung injury (21, 23, 25). 
However, it is not known whether these cells account for all of the 
SFTPC lineage-negative cells that give rise to AEC2s after bleo￾mycin injury. To specifically address this question, we generated 
Sftpc-CreER;Scgb1a-CreER;Rosa-Tm triple-heterozygous mice and 
injected them with a high dose of TMX (4 injections of 0.2 mg/g). 
This strategy labels a majority of AEC2s as well as dual-positive 
SCGB1A1+;SFTPC+ cells in the bronchoalveolar duct junction 
(BADJ) and alveoli and SCGB1A1+ secretory cells throughout 
the bronchioles (Supplemental Figure 2). In control triple-het￾erozygous mice receiving intratracheal saline but not bleomycin, 
89.7% ± 5.2% (n = 3 animals) of the SFTPC+ AEC2s were labeled. 
Importantly, after intratracheal instillation of bleomycin, the pro￾portion of lineage-labeled SFTPC+ cells in heavily fibrotic areas 
only declined to 83.2% ± 5.0%; P = NS (n = 5 mice), a much smaller 
reduction in the proportion of lineage-labeled AEC2s than was 
observed in the Sftpc-CreER;Rosa-Tm mice (Figure 2, A–C). This 
result supports the previous observations that Scgb1a1-CreER
lineage-labeled (referred to as SCGB1A1 lineage) cells give rise to 
AEC2s after bleomycin injury. The fact that there was still a small 
decline suggests that some replacement of damaged AEC2 cells by 
SFTPCneg,SCGB1A1neg cells, whether integrin α6β4
+ or not, does 
occur in this injury/repair system, although the contribution of 
these cells is only minor.
Figure 2
During repair after bleomycin, SCGB1A1 lineage–labeled cells account for most of the SFTPC lineage-negative AEC2s, and clones can arise 
in bronchioles. Sftpc-CreER;Rosa-Tm and Scgb1a1-CreER;Sftpc-CreER;Rosa-Tm mice were dosed with Tmx (0.2 mg/g × 4) and exposed to 
bleomycin (1.25 U/kg). Controls received Tmx and intratracheal saline. Sections of 21-dpi lungs were stained for SFTPC. Confocal z-stack images 
(n ≥ 3 mice per point, 6 sections/mouse) were acquired and cells counted from fibrotic areas (high density of DAPI+ nuclei) or from random 
alveolar areas in controls. (A) Fibrotic region of Sftpc-CreER;Rosa-Tm lung showing clusters of SFTPC+ AECs that are not lineage labeled. By 
contrast, in a similar region of Scgb1a1-CreER;Sftpc-CreER;Rosa-Tm lung (B), significantly more AEC2 cells are lineage labeled. This is quanti￾fied in C. The smaller decline in value in the Scgb1a1-CreER;Sftpc-CreER;Rosa-Tm group compared with Sftpc-CreER;Rosa-Tm group suggests 
that there is no other important source of AEC2 precursors besides SCGB1A1+ cells. (D–F) Scgb1a1-CreER;Rosa-Confetti mice (n = 3) were 
dosed with Tmx (0.05 mg/g × 1) and sacrificed 21 days after bleomycin. Uninjured areas show random labeling of single cells in the bronchiolar 
epithelium (D), while injured areas display clones of labeled cells (E) especially in the BADJ (asterisks). (F) Clones occasionally extend from the 
BADJ (asterisks) into the alveoli, suggesting that at least some of the SCGB1A1+ lineage-labeled cells giving rise to AEC2s and AEC1s originate 
in the bronchioles. Scale bars: 100 μm. See also Supplemental Figure 2.

The experiments described above used a high dose of Tmx, which 
labels many cells. This strategy cannot be used to identify the clonal
origin of the SCGB1A1 lineage–labeled AEC2s and AEC1s and to 
determine whether they arise in the bronchiolar epithelium, in the 
alveoli, or in both locations following bleomycin injury. To address 
this question, we carried out clonal lineage analysis using Scgb1a1-
CreER;Rosa-Confetti mice (n = 3) given a single low dose of Tmx (0.05 
mg/g), which triggers recombination in widely distributed single 
cells. Mice were sacrificed 21 days after intratracheal bleomycin 
(1.25 U/kg) and sections analyzed with confocal microscopy for the 
presence of lineage-labeled clones that span both bronchiolar and 
alveolar compartments (Figure 2D). In uninjured areas of the lung, 
single-labeled bronchiolar cells are widely distributed. However, in 
injured regions (as evidenced by neighboring areas of tissue with 
a high concentration of DAPI+ nuclei), clones of lineage-labeled 
bronchiolar epithelial cells are observed in some BADJ regions of all 
animals, and in some areas the clones extend well into the alveolar 
region (Figure 2, E and F). These findings strongly suggest that at 
least some SCGB1A1 lineage–labeled cells present in the bronchio￾lar epithelium can give rise to AEC2s and AEC1s in a clonal manner.
New model for AEC2-specific alveolar injury and repair with no fibrosis. 
While intratracheal instillation of bleomycin reliably leads to alveo￾lar injury and repair in mouse lungs, the drug causes injury and/or 
death to epithelial, endothelial, and some mesenchymal cells and is 
associated with transient fibrosis. In addition, there is significant 
disruption of lung architecture, complicating quantitative analysis 
of cell behavior during repair (14). To avoid these problems, we have 
developed a more cell-specific injury model compatible with high￾resolution imaging. To do this, we generated Sftpc-CreER;Rosa26R￾loxp-GFP-stop-loxp-diphtheria toxin A (abbreviated Rosa-DTA)/Rosa-Tm
triple heterozygous mice. A single low dose of Tmx (0.05 mg/g) 
induced expression of the catalytic subunit of diphtheria toxin 
and triggers cell death in some, but not all, AEC2s. Importantly, 
by chance, Tmx-induced recombination occurred only at the Rosa￾Tm locus in a proportion of AEC2s, thereby lineage labeling, but 
not killing these AEC2s. We could then trace the behavior of these 
AEC2s following the destruction of their neighbors. We do not 
expect any bystander effects of DTA expression, as the catalytic sub￾unit alone does not bind at the cell surface (26), and furthermore, 
murine cells do not express diphtheria toxin receptor (27).

shows significant increase in cell death in lungs with Rosa-DTA (upper right). Staining for SFTPC (lower panels of A) shows that 1 dose of Tmx 
lineage labels about 52% of the total SFTPC+ AEC2s at 2 dpi. The Rosa-DTA allele reduces the number of both SFTPC+ and lineage-labeled 
cells in the alveoli. (B) Loss of AEC2s results in failure of mice to gain weight over a 7-day period after injection. (C–F) Minimal changes in lung

groups of healthy AEC2s are seen in injured lung. (F) TEM of lipofibroblast (Lp) adjacent to AEC2 and capillary (cp) at 2 dpi. Scale bars: 100 μm

Two days after giving Tmx to Sftpc-CreER;Rosa-DTA/Rosa-Tm
mice, we observed many TUNEL-positive cells, suggesting apop￾tosis and cell death (Figure 3A). This was confirmed by transmis￾sion electron microscopy (TEM) showing abnormal AEC2s with 
clumped chromatin and disintegrating organelles as well as cells 
being engulfed by macrophages (data not shown). We were techni￾cally unable to quantify the precise proportion of cell death at this 
time by costaining for TUNEL and SFTPC. However, while recog￾nizing that Cre-based recombination may not be the same at both 
Rosa loci, we estimated a value of approximately 52%, based upon 
the recombination of the Rosa-Tm allele with the same dose of Tmx 
(see below). Immunohistochemistry of tissue from DTA and con￾trol animals 2 days after Tmx revealed a significant decrease in 
the number of SFTPC+ AEC2s after DTA ablation compared with 
controls (Figure 3A); there was also a similar decrease in the num￾ber AEC2s expressing LAMP3+ (DC-LAMP/CD208) — a member of 
the lysosomal-associated membrane protein family and a marker 
of normal AEC2s in mouse and human (ref. 28 and Supplemental 
Figure 3A). Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) of whole lung iso￾lated at the same time after Tmx confirmed that the level of tran￾scripts for both AEC2 markers decreased following DTA ablation 
(Supplemental Figure 3B).
Despite the extent of AEC2 cell death and a transient failure of 
the mice to gain weight (Figure 3B), the overall histology of the 
lung remained remarkably intact at 2, 4, 7, and 21 days post injec￾tion (dpi) (Figure 3, C and D, and Figure 4): there was little inflam￾mation and no evidence of alveolar collapse. Repair of the epithe￾lium appeared complete by about 21 dpi, as suggested by a normal 
distribution of SFTPC+ cells in the alveoli (Supplemental Figure 
5A). Contrary to what has been described in another injury model 
in which chronic depletion of AEC2s led to pulmonary fibrosis 
(29), histology also remained relatively normal even after 4 doses 
of Tmx (0.05 mg/g) given every 2 weeks, and there was no statis￾tically significant increase in hydroxyproline content (although 
there was a trend toward significance) in these lungs compared 
with lungs from Sftpc-CreER;Rosa-Tm double-heterozygous con￾trols (Supplemental Figure 3C).
AEC2s undergo clonal proliferation after targeted injury. To lineage 
trace surviving AEC2s during repair after 1 round of cell abla￾tion, a cohort of Sftpc-CreER;Rosa-DTA/Rosa-Tm mice and Sftpc￾CreER;Rosa-Tm littermate controls were injected with a single 
dose of Tmx (0.05 mg/g) and lineage-labeled AEC2s followed over 
21 days (Figure 4, A–D). As expected from our earlier long-term 
lineage trace experiments, the proportion of lineage-labeled cells 
remained relatively constant over the chase period in the Sftpc￾CreER;Rosa-Tm control lungs (52.1% ± 0.9%, 47.1% ± 5.3%, and 
61.4% ± 2.2% at 2 dpi, 7 dpi, and 21 dpi; n = 3 mice per group). 
In the Rosa-DTA group, the initial proportion of lineage-labeled 
AEC2s was lower, with only 22.9% ± 4.8% of the AECs being tagged 
at 2 dpi. However, this value also did not change significantly dur￾ing repair (29.9% ± 3.1%, 7 dpi; 31.5% ± 0.3%, 21 dpi), even as the 
total number of lineage-labeled AEC2s increased. This suggests 
that the surviving lineage-labeled cells did not have a proliferative 
advantage or disadvantage over other survivors that proliferated 
but were not tagged.
Not unexpectedly, as measured by colocalization of EdU with lin￾eage label at 2 and 7 dpi, there was higher proliferation of AEC2s in 
SftpcCreER;Rosa-DTA/Rosa-Tm mice (8.4% ± 6.8% and 4.3% ± 0.4%, 
n = 3 mice per group) compared with SftpcCreER;Rosa-Tm control 
animals (0.20% ± 0.19% and 0.31% ± 0.13%). Minimal proliferation 
was observed in AEC2s of both groups at 21 dpi, consistent with 
repair being complete around this time (Figure 4, A and C). Con￾focal analysis of sections of SftpcCreER;Rosa-DTA/Rosa-Tm lungs 
during repair showed initially a preponderance of single lineage￾labeled Tm+ cells. A few days later, small clusters were seen; when 
well separated from each other, these clusters were presumed to 
represent clones derived from single AEC2s (Figure 4, A and B). The 
clusters were tightly packed at 2 and 7 dpi. Immunohistochemistry 
showed that these cells express SFTPC, and in addition, TEM at 
4 dpi revealed small groups of morphologically normal AEC2s 
with lamellar bodies (Figure 3E). Significantly, by 21 dpi, the cells 
within clusters were more dispersed, sometimes in linear arrays 
(Figure 4A and Supplemental Figure 4A). Moreover, a few lineage￾labeled AEC1s were seen intermingled with lineage-labeled AEC2s 
at this time (Figure 4A, inset, and Supplemental Figure 4B). Assess￾ment of at least 12 random ×20 fields of view from n = 3 Sftpc￾CreER;Rosa-DTA/Rosa-Tm animals revealed that 1.3% ± 0.4% of total 
lineage-labeled cells were AEC1s (compared with 0.30% ± 0.06% 
in Sftpc-CreER;Rosa-Tm control animals). This proportion of lin￾eage-labeled cells scored as AEC1s is in marked contrast to that 
which we previously observed in Sftpc-CreER;Rosa-Tm mice 21 
days following bleomycin instillation (41.4% ± 4.4%; ref. 13). All 
of these data from confocal analysis of sections were recapitulated 
when whole-mount lung lobes were examined with a multiphoton 
microscope after clearing in Scale solution (30), thereby enabling 
imaging deeper into the tissue (Figure 4B and Supplemental 
Figure 4C). Together, these results strongly suggest that lineage￾labeled AEC2s are capable of clonal proliferation and differentia￾tion during repair after targeted injury.
To further examine clonal proliferation, we used the Rosa-Confetti
allele. Sftpc-CreER;Rosa-DTA/Rosa-Confetti and SftpcCreER;Rosa-Con￾fetti controls were given a low dose of Tmx as before and examined 
at 7, 21, and 70 dpi (n = 1 per group, 2 per group at day 70). Lungs 
were cleared in Scale and imaged by whole mount by stereoscopic, 
confocal, or multiphoton microscopy (Figure 4E and Supplemen￾tal Figure 5B). As expected, discrete clones of single colors (either 
red, green, yellow, or cyan) were randomly dispersed throughout 
the tissue in DTA-Confetti animals. This is again strong evidence 
that at least a subset of AEC2s are capable of clonal proliferation 
following injury to the alveolar epithelium.
Because there is much interest in the characterization and poten￾tial stem cell role of SFTPC+SCGB1A1+ cells in terminal bronchi￾oles, we sought to determine whether the clones that arose after 
DTA injury preferentially derived from this cell population. We first 
quantified the occurrence of SFTPC+SCGB1A1+ cells in the BADJ 
in the DTA model to determine whether there was an increase in 
lineage labeling of these cells in the setting of AEC2 ablation. We 
found an increase in the number of SFTPC+SCGB1A1+ cells in the

with controls (0.93 ± 0.10 dual+ cells per BADJ in DTA animals 
[n = 3] vs. 0.15 ± 0.04 dual+ cells per BADJ in controls [n = 3]; mean 
± SEM; P = 0.002). None of the SFTPC+SCGB1A1+ cells in either 
experimental group were EdU positive (50 mg/kg dosed 3 hours 
before sacrifice; data not shown). Furthermore, the occurrence of 
SFTPC lineage-labeled SFTPC+SCGB1A1+ cells remained very low 
and was similar between DTA and control animals (0.025 ± 0.013 
dual+ cells per BADJ in DTA animals vs. 0.049 ± 0.031 cells per 
BADJ in controls [n = 3 per group]). The most likely explanation 
for these findings is that SFTPC is upregulated in SCGB1A1+ cells 
at the BADJ following injury.

Following this assessment, we asked whether SFTPC+ cells 
within or around the BADJ are more likely to clonally prolifer￾ate after DTA injury compared with SFTPC+ cells located with￾in the alveoli. To do this, we imaged multiple sections of lungs 
from n = 3 Sftpc-CreER;Rosa-DTA/Rosa-Tm mice 7 days after Tmx 
injection, along with appropriate littermate controls. For each 
image, in a blinded manner, we placed a 300 μm × 300 μm square 
either at the BADJ (n ≥ 25 BADJs per mouse) or in the alveolar 
space (removed from the BADJ by at least 300 μm) and counted 
the number of clones in each square (Figure 4F). If clones pref￾erentially arose from SFTPC+ cells in and around the terminal 
bronchioles (including dual-positive SFTPC+SCGB1A1+ cells in 
the BADJ), we would expect to see more clones in the vicinity of 
the BADJ than in the alveoli. Our analysis revealed the opposite, 
that there are significantly more clones in the alveolar space than 
near the BADJ (2.04 ± 0.16 [mean ± SEM] clones per square in the 
alveoli versus 0.62 ± 0.22 clones per square near the BADJ) (Figure 
4G). This result argues that the SFTPC+ cells that clonally expand 
after DTA injury are not more likely to be in/near the BADJ than 
within the alveoli. The average number of cells per cluster was 
similar in each group (2.77 ± 0.17 cells per cluster in DTA group 
vs. 2.98 ± 0.12 cells per cluster in controls).

do not proliferate preferentially. (E) An Sftpc-CreER;Rosa-DTA/Rosa-Confetti mouse was given Tmx (0.05 mg/g × 1) and 10 weeks later, lungs

In order to rule out spontaneously occurring recombination 
events early in development as the etiology of the clonal AEC2s, 
we sacrificed a cohort of adult Sftpc-CreER;Rosa-DTA/Rosa-Confetti
mice (n = 3), and imaged cleared lung tissue on the stereoscope. We 
saw no evidence of spontaneously occurring lineage-labeled AEC2 
clusters (Supplemental Figure 3D).
Single lineage-labeled AEC2s form 3D alveolar-like structures (alveolo￾spheres) when cultured with PDGFRA-H2B:GFP+ stromal cells. The results 
of the in vivo injury/repair model described above show that indi￾vidual SFTPC+ AEC2s can clonally proliferate and give rise to AEC1s 
in vivo in the context of a preexisting alveolar environment, albeit 
one that has been specifically depleted of AEC2s. This suggests that 
components of the niche survive the injury, but precisely which cells, 
signals, and/or matrix components are important for regulating 
clonal expansion is not known. To begin to address these questions, 
we established a clonal 3D coculture system in which AEC2s were

combined with specific mesenchymal cell populations. Lineage￾labeled AEC2s from Sftpc-CreER;Rosa-Tm animals that received doses 
of Tmx that labeled 85% of AEC2s were isolated by FACS and seeded 
in culture medium with 50% Matrigel in Transwell inserts (Figure 
5A). Importantly, when plated alone under these conditions, there 
was no proliferation of the lineage-labeled cells.
Recognizing the importance of PDGFRA+ cells in lung develop￾ment and alveolarization (31), we cocultured AEC2s with primary 
PDGFRA+ cells isolated from heterozygous Pdgfra-H2B:GFP+ ani￾mals (6 to 12 weeks of age). In these mice, H2B:GFP is expressed 
from the endogenous Pdgfra locus (32), and approximately 29% 
of the total mesenchymal cell population in the lung is Pdgfra￾H2B:GFP+ (Supplemental Figure 6A). We collected GFPhi cells 
(Figure 5A), a population that is thought to include alveolar fibro￾blasts and lipofibroblasts (33), and seeded them with lineage￾labeled AEC2s at a density of 5,000 AEC2s and 100,000 GFPhi cells 
per insert. Sphere-like colony formation was typically seen by 4 to 
6 days post plating (dpp). Spheres enlarged for the first 10 days 
and appeared to have a single lumen; they later become denser as 
cells accumulated within the center (Figure 5, B and C). Colony 
forming efficiency (CFE) at 14 dpp was 2.3% ± 0.3% (mean ± SEM) 
(n = 8 experiments, ≥ 2 technical replicates per experiment) (Fig￾ure 5D). The clonal origin of spheres was confirmed by mixing 
experiments in which lineage-labeled AEC2s were plated at equal 
densities with GFPhi cells sorted from a Sftpc-GFP transgenic 
mouse line (34). All resulting spheres were either completely Tm+
or GFP+ (Supplemental 
Figure 6, C and D).
Histological analysis and 
confocal microscopy (Fig￾ure 5, E–H) showed that all 
the epithelial cells within 
spheres were lineage labeled. 
Markedly, the periph￾eral cells were cuboidal, 
expressed SFTPC (but not 
SCGB1A1), and proliferat￾ed as judged by Ki67 stain￾ing (Supplemental Figure 
6B). Interior cells were more 
elongated and expressed the 
AEC1 markers T1a (Pdpn) 
and Aquaporin 5 (Aqp5). 
Most of these cells also 
expressed homeodomain 
only protein x (HOPX) (Fig￾ure 5I), a new marker for 
AEC1s in the mouse lung. 
We initially identified HopX
in studies comparing tran￾scripts in SFTPC lineage￾labeled cells at different 
times after bleomycin injury 
to identify potential mark￾ers or regulators of AEC2 
differentiation (ref. 13 and 
our unpublished observa￾tions). HOPX is known to 
regulate both cardiac devel￾opment (35) and pulmo￾nary maturation (36) and immunohistochemistry of adult mouse 
lungs showed HOPX expression in AEC1s (Supplemental Figure 7).
All lineage-labeled spheres were of the morphology described 
above (serial sections of at least 50 spheres fixed after 14–17 days 
in culture from n = 3 independent experiments) and none con￾tained SOX2+, SCGB1A1+, KRT5+, or p63+ secretory or basal cells 
(data not shown). This uniformity is in marked contrast to the 
multiple colony types described by other investigators in which 
distal lung cells, sorted by surface marker expression, are plated in 
3D Matrigel assays (25, 37, 38).
TEM was used to investigate the phenotype of Sftpc-CreEr lineage￾labeled cells in 3D culture. This showed that by 14 dpp, many cells 
had abundant, well-formed lamellar bodies containing surfactant. 
Moreover, the contents were clearly being released into the inner 
spaces of the spheres, where they accumulated in copious amounts. 
The elongated cells lacked lamellar bodies but had thin cytoplasmic 
projections, consistent with the morphology of AEC1s (Figure 5, J 
and K). Given that colonies arising from individual AEC2s have an 
alveolar-like structure and contain cells that resemble both mature 
AEC2s and AEC1s, we have termed them “alveolospheres.”
To determine whether lineage-labeled AEC2s continue to self 
renew and differentiate in culture, 14 dpp spheres were dissociat￾ed and single Tm+ cells isolated by FACS and replated with freshly 
isolated PDGFRA-GFPhi cells. CFE was 6.2% ± 0.7% after passage 1 
and 5.1% ± 0.7% after passage 2 (P = NS for P1 vs. P2) (Figure 5D). 
Moreover, colonies had the same expanded morphology, with

SFTPC+ cells on the periphery and cells with AEC1 markers inside 
(data not shown).
Recapitulating the AEC2 stem cell niche with Pdgfra-H2B:GFP+ cells. To 
address the specificity of the PDGFRA+ trophic effect, we seeded 
AEC2s with fibroblasts from an immortalized fibroblast cell line 
(MLg neonatal mouse lung fibroblasts) previously shown to sup￾port the growth of distal mouse lung epithelial progenitor cells 
(37, 39). Under these conditions, CFE between days 11 and 14 
was only 1.5% ± 0.2% (n = 3 experiments). While there was some 
evidence of differentiation of AEC2s to T1a+ AEC1s after 14 days 
in culture, the colonies were much smaller and flatter than those 
grown with PDGFRA+ cells (Supplemental Figure 6E).
The observation that PDGFRA-GFPhi cells efficiently promote 
the self renewal and differentiation of isolated SFTPC+ AEC2s in 
culture suggests that these mesenchymal cells constitute a criti￾cal component of the AEC2 stem cell niche in vivo. Lung sections 
from normal Pdgfra-H2B:GFP mice showed that SFTPC+ AEC2s are 
generally located in close proximity to cells expressing high levels 
of PDGFRA-GFP fluorescence (PDGFRA-GFP+) (Figure 6B). The 
PDGFRA-GFP+ cells expressed the intermediate filament protein 
desmin (Figure 6D and ref. 40), while our previous studies showed 
that they do not coexpress PDGFRβ or αSMA (13). There are 
PDGFRA-GFP+ cells near the aSMA+ airways, but these cells 
appeared to express H2B:GFP at lower levels than in the alveoli (Fig￾ure 6A). LipidTOX staining revealed that the majority of PDGFRA￾GFP+ cells in the alveoli contained lipid droplets (Figure 6, A and B) 
and PDGFRA-GFP+ cells were LipidTOX+ when FACS-sorted (Fig￾ure 6C), evidence supporting the conclusion that these PDGFRA￾GFP+ cells are lipofibroblasts (41). TEM analysis of a normal area 
from Sftpc-CreER;Rosa-Tm/Rosa-DTA lung at 2 dpi (Figure 3F) con￾firmed previous studies showing lipofibroblasts in close proximity 
to AEC2s in vivo (40). In addition, immunohistochemistry con￾firmed the presence of PDGFRA-GFP+ cells within and around the 
spheres, and TEM of alveolospheres revealed lipid-filled cells in close 
proximity to the lamellar body–containing cells (Figure 6, E–G).
Human AEC2s form self-renewing colonies in 3D culture. We have 
begun to address the question of whether AEC2s from human 
lungs are also long-term self-renewing stem cells able to give 
rise to alveolospheres in 3D culture. AEC2s were isolated using 
FACS based on expression of the surface marker HTII-280 (18). 
Immunohistochemistry of normal human lungs confirmed that 
HTII-280 and SFTPC colocalize, with HTII-280 being expressed 
on the luminal surface and SFTPC in the cytoplasm (Figure 7A). 
There was no evidence of HTII-280 staining in the airways except 
for occasional cuboidal cells in respiratory bronchioles.
To establish 3D culture, HTII-280+ cells isolated by FACS were 
seeded in Transwell inserts in 50% Matrigel with MRC5 cells, a fetal 
human lung fibroblast cell line. Spheres were seen after 5–7 days 
with a CFE of 4.2% ± 0.8% (n = 3 biological replicates; mean ± SEM) 
(Figure 7, B–D). No spheres were observed in the absence of MRC5 
cells. Serial subculture resulted in CFEs of 7.4% ± 1.6% and 4.9% at 
passages 1 and 2, respectively (n = 3 at passage 1; n = 2 at passage 2). 
Histological analysis showed that the human spheres were com￾posed of a single epithelial layer; all cells express HTII-280 on the 
luminal surface, and a majority, but not all, express SFTPC. TEM 
reveals the presence of lamellar bodies, consistent with at least some 
of the cells being mature AEC2s (Figure 7, E–G). No cells in the 
spheres morphologically resemble or express AEC1 markers.
Discussion
Important goals for the field of lung stem cell research are to 
define the epithelial populations that maintain the alveolar region

will use live imaging to address the question of AEC2 migratory 
behavior. It will also be important to carry out statistical analysis 
of changes in clone size over time under different conditions, as 
done recently in other organ systems (17, 44). This will give critical 
insight into the heterogeneity of the AEC2 population in vivo and 
whether some cells behave as committed progenitors during repair 
while others behave as long-term stem cells.
The fact that we have been able to grow and serially subcul￾ture individual AEC2s in a 3D organoid culture system supports 
the concept that SFTPC+ AEC2s as a population contain stem 
cells. We are confident that alveolospheres are not derived from 
SFTPC+;SCGB1A1+ cells in the terminal bronchioles because 
these cells make up only a small percentage of the total lineage￾labeled population (0.29%) and the CFE in our assay is consistent￾ly about 10-fold higher. We cannot exclude, however, that a sub￾set of AEC2s within the alveoli is more capable of clonal growth 
in vitro than others; further quantitative analysis is needed to 
address this interesting question.
Importantly, while there was some variation in size of lineage￾labeled spheres in culture, they displayed the same morphology 
after serial sectioning. They consistently and reproducibly con￾tained not only well-differentiated AEC2s with mature lamellar 
bodies but also cells localized to the interior of the spheres that 
express multiple AECI markers, including HOPX, but not bron￾chiolar cell types. This homogeneity demonstrates an important 
characteristic of our culture system: that we are starting with a 
well-characterized, specific population of cells known to initially 
reside in the alveoli that gives rise to a homogenous population 
of colonies containing only alveolar cells. This is in contrast to 
the populations of distal progenitor cells studied by other inves￾tigators that ultimately yield mixed colony types containing both 
alveolar and bronchiolar cells (25, 37, 38).
The alveolosphere assay we describe here has opened up strat￾egies for identifying the cells that make up the niche of AEC2s 
in vivo and the signals that they produce. The Pdgfra-H2B:GFPhi
population, which appears to contain alveolar fibroblasts and 
lipofibroblasts, is clearly able to support both the proliferation 
and differentiation of AEC2s. However, we do not know whether 
these properties are shared by all cells in the GFP+ population or 
whether some subsets of cells are efficient at supporting prolif￾eration while others promote conversion of AEC2s into AEC1s. 
The relatively low CFE in our assay, even in the presence of 
PDGFRA+ cells, suggests that there are other crucial components 
of the niche, for example, endothelial cells or even AEC1s, that 
need to be added for optimal clonal expansion.
Finally, our data show that human AEC2s are capable of clonal 
growth in vitro, but we have not observed the differentiation of 
these AEC2s into AEC1s. One potential reason for this deficiency 
is that MRC5 cells do not adequately recapitulate the human 
alveolar stem cell niche in this model. Interestingly, hyperplastic 
AEC2s and accelerated cell proliferation are common features of 
IPF (45), suggesting that dysregulation of the alveolar niche may 
be an important mechanism in pathological remodeling of the 
lung parenchyma. Future experiments will test the hypothesis that 
stromal cells are critical regulators of alveolar homeostasis and are 
dysregulated in tissue remodeling.
Methods
Mice. Mice were Sftpc-CreERT2; Scgb1a1-CreERTM; and Rosa26R-CAG-tdTm 
(Rosa-Tm) (13); Rosa26R-CAG-Confetti (Rosa-Confetti) (19) (supplied by 
and repair it after injury and to identify the signaling pathways 
that regulate these behaviors. Here, we have addressed some out￾standing questions and opened up new opportunities for future 
advances. Specifically, we provide evidence that SFTPC+ AEC2s, as 
a population, function as alveolar progenitors and long-term stem 
cells in the adult lung. This evidence comes from lineage-tracing 
studies both during homeostasis and in a model of alveolar repair 
that allows us to visualize in situ clonal expansion of individual 
AEC2s. Finally, our new alveolosphere assay shows that a popula￾tion of Pdgfra-H2B:GFPhi stromal cells, which includes lipofibro￾blasts that normally reside in the proximity of AEC2s, can support 
their clonal growth and differentiation in vitro.
Our previous lineage-tracing experiments had established that 
SFTPC+ AEC2s can proliferate and give rise to AEC1s in vivo (13). 
What was missing was evidence that the same SFTPC+ cells can 
maintain the AEC2 population over the long term, an important 
criterion for defining the population as containing stem cells. We 
now show that long-term self renewal does occur, at least over 
almost a year. In the unperturbed lung, lineage-labeled AEC2s give 
rise to only small clones of daughter cells, and there is a low rate 
of differentiation into AEC1s. However, clonal growth and differ￾entiation are both enhanced if the number of AEC2s is depleted 
by selective cell ablation. Interestingly, while AEC2s do give rise 
to AECIs during DTA-induced repair, the rate of differentiation 
still appears to be significantly lower than during repair after 
bleomycin-induced lung injury (13). This suggests that bleomy￾cin injury promotes the production of local signals that enhance 
the conversion of AEC2s to AEC1s. In the future, clues as to the 
identity of these signaling pathways may come from comparing 
the transcriptional activities of AEC2s and stromal cells in the 
2 injury/repair models.
While SFTPC+ AEC2s can maintain the alveoli during steady 
state and after depletion of AEC2s, other epithelial cell populations 
clearly contribute to alveolar repair following bleomycin-induced 
injury. We and others have previously shown that in the bleomycin 
model, epithelial cells that express SCGB1A1 can proliferate and 
differentiate into AEC2s (13, 21, 23). It has been suggested that 
other SFTPCneg cells, including those enriched for integrin α6β4
(20), are mobilized to give rise to AEC2s under conditions of severe 
injury and inflammation. However, our studies following the pop￾ulations of cells lineage labeled by both Sftpc-CreER and Scgb1a1-
CreER alleles in fibrotic regions of the bleomycin-treated lung sug￾gest that any contribution of SFTPCneg cells to the repair is only 
a minor one. Our AEC2 cell–specific ablation model of alveolar 
injury has opened the possibility of using clonal analysis to follow 
AEC2 localization and behavior during the 21-day repair period. 
Immediately after AEC2 depletion, only single lineage-labeled 
cells were seen. These gave rise to clusters of cells that likely repre￾sent clones. These clusters were not preferentially localized to the 
BADJs, but were found throughout the alveoli. They were closely 
packed at 7 dpi, but by 21 dpi were more widely distributed beyond 
the diameter of a typical alveolus. Two explanations for this appar￾ent dispersal are the expansion of portions of the lung that col￾lapsed following loss of AEC2s and active migration of SFTPC+
cells themselves. Currently, we favor the latter hypothesis because 
collapse appears to be minimal and expansion would not account 
for the linear arrays of lineage-labeled cells seen at 7 and 21 dpi. We 
hypothesize that the cells travel through fenestrations in the alveoli 
known as pores of Kohn (42, 43) and disperse within an individual 
acinus, which is composed of hundreds of alveoli. Future studies

and kept on a rocker at 4°C for 1–2 weeks until maximal tissue clearing 
occurred. Whole-mount samples were imaged either on the inverted Zeiss 
710 confocal microscope in a 35-mm glass-bottom microwell dish with a 
10× objective or immersed in Scale A2 solution using an Olympus FV1000 
Multiphoton scope equipped with a ×25/0.9 NA ScaleView immersion lens 
(XLPLN25XSVMP WD 8 mm) and Prior H117 ProScan III encoded XY 
motorized stage, allowing acquisition of tiled images from large areas and 
volumes of tissue. Imaris software was used to reconstruct and analyze 3D 
images acquired from the multiphoton scope.
Hydroxyproline assay. Total lung collagen content was measured by the 
hydroxyproline method (46).
TEM. Tissue and cell culture insert were processed to preserve lamellar 
bodies as previously reported (47).
Mouse cell culture. Sorted cells were resuspended in MTEC/Plus (48), and 
mixed with 1:1 growth factor–reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences); 90 μl was 
placed in a 24-well 0.4-μm Transwell insert (Falcon). 5 × 103 AEC2s and 
1 × 105 PDGFRA-GFPhi cells were seeded in each insert. 500 μl MTEC/
Plus was placed in the lower chamber, and medium was changed every 
other day. ROCK inhibitor (10 μM, Y0503; Sigma-Aldrich) was included in 
the medium for the first 2 days of culture, which was at 37°C in 5% CO2/
air. For paraffin embedding, the Matrigel disc was removed, dehydrated 
through ethanol, and transitioned into paraffin by standard protocols.
For passaging experiments, spheres were dissociated from Matrigel with 
the addition of 60 μl Dispase (catalog #354235, 5 U/ml; BD Biosciences) 
to the insert and incubation at 37°C for 30 minutes. Cells were washed and 
then incubated in 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA for 30 minutes at 37°C to create a 
single-cell suspension. Cells were then sorted via FACS, and Tm+ cells were 
replated with primary PDGFRA-GFP+ cells.
Human cell culture. Under IRB-approved protocols, human AEC2s were 
isolated from lungs not used for transplantation. Parenchyma was mechan￾ically dissociated by mincing and further dissociated using 2 U/ml dispase 
(BD Biosciences), 0.25% trypsin/2 mM EDTA (Cellgro), and 10 U/ml 
elastase (Worthington). Dissociated cells were passed through a 70-μm 
cell strainer and plated onto PurCol-coated (Advanced Biomatrix) culture 
dishes in bronchial epithelial growth medium (BEGM) (49) overnight at 
37°C. The following day, adherent cells were harvested using trypsin/EDTA 
and labeled for FACS using PE/Cy7 mouse anti-CD45 (0.6 μg/ml 304015; 
BioLegend), Alexa Fluor 647 anti-EpCAM (0.6 μg/ml 324212; BioLegend), 
PE/Cy7 anti-CD31 (0.6 μg/ml 303117; BioLegend), mouse IgM anti-human 
HTII-280 (1:60 dilution), and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgM (20 
μg/ml A-21042; Invitrogen). Single viable cells that were CD45–, CD31–, 
EpCAM+, and HTII-280+ were mixed with MRC5 fibroblasts in 1:1 Matrigel/
human ALI medium (49) and 100 μl added to 24-well (0.4-μm) Transwell 
filter inserts (Greiner Bio-One). 500 μl of ALI medium was placed in the 
lower chamber and changed every other day. Cultures were maintained in a 
humidified 37°C incubator in 5% CO2/air.

and Lynn Sakai, Terry Lechler and other colleagues for stimulat￾ing discussions. This work was supported by T32HL007538 (pro￾Hans Clevers); Rosa26R-loxp-GFP-stop-loxp-DTA (Rosa-DTA) and B6.129S4-
Pdgfratm11(EGFP)Sor/J (Pdgfra-H2B:GFP) from The Jackson Laboratory and 
Sftpc-GFP (34). Mice for the 48-week lineage trace were on a 129S;C57BL/6 
mixed background and controls matched for sex and were littermates. All 
other mice were at least at the N2 backcross generation to C57BL/6. Most 
mice were 8–12 weeks old; Pdgfra-H2B:GFP mice were at least 6 weeks old. 
There was some variability in the extent of injury following TMX dos￾ing (0.05 mg/g) of Sftpc-CreER;Rosa-DTA/Rosa-Tm mice, as approximately 
20% of injected mice died between 4 and 6 dpi with no apparent sex dif￾ferences. Administration of Tmx at doses higher than 0.05 mg/g led to 
substantial animal mortality.
Tmx, bleomycin, and EdU administration. Tmx (T5648; Sigma-Aldrich) was 
a 20 mg/ml stock solution in corn oil and given via i.p. injection. Bleomy￾cin (1.25 U/kg in 0.9% sterile saline) was administered intratracheally as 
described (13). EdU (Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 647 Imaging Kit C10340; 
Invitrogen) was administered via i.p. injection (50 mg/kg).
Histology and immunohistochemistry. Mouse tissue was routinely fixed with 
4% PFA in PBS and cryosections (12 μm) and paraffin sections (7 μm) 
prepared as described (13). Paraffin sections underwent 10 mM sodium 
citrate antigen retrieval. Antibodies were as follows: rabbit, SFTPC (1:500; 
#ab3786; Millipore); goat, SFTPC (1:100; #SC-7706; Santa Cruz Biotech￾nology Inc.); goat, secretoglobin 1a1 (SCGB1A1) (1:10,000; Barry Stripp); 
rabbit, aquaporin 5 (1:200; #ab78486; Abcam); hamster, Pdpn (T1α) 
(1:1000; clone 8.1.1; DSHB); rabbit, HOPX (1:250; #SC-30216; Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology Inc.); chicken, GFP (1:1000; #GFP1020; Aves Lab); rabbit, 
RFP (1:250; #600–401379; Rockland); rabbit, desmin (1:200; #RB-9014-P0; 
Thermo-Fisher); rabbit, Ki67 (1:500; #ab15580; Abcam); rat, Lamp3 (1:50; 
#DDX0192; Dendritics); rabbit, Sox2 (1:750; #WRAB-1236; Seven Hills 
Bioreagents); rabbit, Krt5 (1:1000; #PRB-160P; Covance); and mouse, p63 
(1:50; #SC-8431; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). Alexa Fluor–coupled sec￾ondary antibodies (Invitrogen) were used at 1:500. TUNEL (Roche Applied 
Science) and HCS LipidTOX (Life Technologies) staining were performed 
on paraffin or cryosections respectively, according to the manufacturers’ 
instructions. EdU staining was performed according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. Human tissue and colonies were fixed in 10% neutral buff￾ered formalin overnight and then placed in PBS until paraffin embedding. 
Mouse IgM anti-human HTII-280 (1:100 dilution of hybridoma superna￾tant) was generously provided by Leland Dobbs (Cardiovascular Research 
Institute, UCSD, San Francisco, California, USA) (18).
qRT-PCR. Gene expression levels were quantified by qRT-PCR on the 
StepOne Plus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) as described 
previously (13). Primers are listed in Supplemental Table 1.
Mouse lung dissociation and FACS. Lungs were dissociated with a protease 
solution as described (13). Whole-lung suspension was blocked in 1% FcX 
TruStain (#101320; Biolegend) in 2% FBS, 2% BSA in 1× PBS. Antibodies 
for mouse flow cytometry were optimized with appropriate IgG isotype 
controls and were as follows: rat, CD31-biotinylated (1:50, #13-0311; eBio￾science); rat, CD45-biotinylated (1:200; #13-0451-82; eBioscience); and rat, 
EpCAM-PE/Cy7 (1:800, #25-5791-80; eBioscience). Secondary antibody 
was as follows: PE/Cy5 streptavidin (1:500, #405205; Biolegend). Sorting 
was performed on FACS Vantage SE, and data were analyzed with FACS 
Diva (BD Biosciences).
Confocal microscopy. All images used for scoring cells consisted of a Z stack of 
multiple optical sections captured on a Zeiss 710 or Zeiss 780 inverted confo￾cal microscope. Confocal Z stack images were analyzed and all cells counted 
with the Manually Count Object feature on MetaMorph (Version 7.7.1.0).
Scale processing and imaging. Scale A2 reagent (30) (4M urea [Fisher BP169-
212], 0.1% wt/vol Triton X-100, 10% wt/wt glycerol in water) was allowed 
to stand for at least 1 day at room temperature before use. Following fixa￾tion with 4% PFA and washing with PBS, tissue was transferred to Scale A2
