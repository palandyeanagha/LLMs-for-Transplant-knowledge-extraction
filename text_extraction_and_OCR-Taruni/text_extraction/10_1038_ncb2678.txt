For almost two years, the virus entry path￾way and mechanism of host penetration con￾tinued to elude us. However, in the spring 
of 1978, I had the chance to participate in a 
Dahlem Conference in Berlin called ‘Transport 
of Macromolecules in Cellular Systems’. It was 
an opportune time for a meeting on this topic: 
pathways of vesicle transport were being dis￾covered, receptor-mediated trafficking pro￾cesses were beginning to be described, and the 
important role of clathrin-coated vesicles was 
finally properly appreciated. All the leaders in 
the membrane cell biology field were present. 
During a coffee break, I asked William Sly, a 
pioneer in the trafficking of mannose-6-phos￾phate receptors, whether he knew what weak 
bases such as ammonium chloride and chlo￾roquine do to cells. He directed me to a paper 
by Brian Poole showing that these agents raise 
the pH in lysosomes.
When Erik Fries and I were discussing the 
conference in the laboratory the following 
week, he made a remark that changed every￾thing. He simply asked, “Could pH have some￾thing to do with it?” Suddenly, all the pieces of 
the puzzle fell into a coherent picture. We real￾ized that the acidic pH in lysosomes and other 
endocytic vacuoles was not only required to 
optimize the degradative action of acid hydro￾lases, but could also serve as a ‘cue’ for viruses 
to activate their penetration mechanism. 
Exposure to low pH ‘told’ the viruses that they 
had entered a cell and reached the endocytic 
pathway, and that it was time to activate the 
penetration machinery. We speculated that low 
pH induced a change in the spike glycoproteins 
present on the virus envelope that allowed 
fusion of the viral envelope from the lumenal 
side with the limiting membrane of the vacuole. 
As a result, the viral capsid was released into 
the cytosol without itself having to cross the 
hydrophobic barriers formed by a membrane.
Over the following months, we validated 
all the predictions of our pH hypothesis. For 
example, we could demonstrate a membrane 
fusion reaction in  vitro by simply mixing 
liposomes and SFV, and briefly dropping the pH 
to 6 or below. Moreover, when we added acidic 
medium to cells, we could ‘fool’ surface-bound 
viruses into fusing with the plasma membrane; 
the entry block caused by weak bases was 
bypassed and the cells became infected.
Joined by Judy White, Mark Marsh and 
Karl Matlin as postdoctoral fellows in the lab, 
we extended the acid-activation concept to 
other viruses. For the influenza A virus, the 
threshold was a pH-unit lower, and exposure 
to low pH induced a dramatic, irreversible 
conformational change in the haemagglutinin 
glycoprotein. We realized, moreover, that the 
acidic organelles where viruses were activated 
were not lysosomes, but pre-lysosomal vacu￾oles. We called these vacuoles ‘endosomes’, a 
name that soon became the general term used 
for these complicated and dynamic compart￾ments.
Today, we know that most viruses (whether 
enveloped or not) use endocytic entry mecha￾nisms. For the majority, a drop in pH serves as 
a trigger for host penetration. Some bacterial 
toxins also rely on low pH as a cue. Moreover, 
it is well known that differences in the pH 
between compartments regulate directional 
transport of cargo in the endocytic and secre￾tory pathways. Endosomes have attained a vis￾ibility and recognition that those of us working 
on them in the early 1980s could hardly have 
dreamt of. I have had other turning points 
along my scientific path, but none of them with 
quite as many significant consequences as the 
one involving endosomal entry of SFV and the 
role of pH.
COMPETING FINANCIAL INTERESTS
The author declares no competing financial interests.
After several years of working on membrane 
proteins using the Semliki Forest virus (SFV) as 
a model, I decided in 1976 to focus my research 
on the mechanisms by which animal viruses 
such as SFV enter and infect their host cells. 
I had just moved from Finland with the lab of 
Kai Simons to the newly founded European 
Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in 
Heidelberg, Germany. I was eager to tackle a 
challenging problem — and one that did not 
require work with detergents.
Relying almost exclusively on electron 
microscopy, previous work on animal virus 
entry had left the field divided between pro￾ponents of direct virus penetration through 
the plasma membrane of the host cell and 
those who favoured penetration into the 
cytosol from intracellular vacuoles after endo￾cytosis. Together with Jürgen Kartenbeck, a 
colleague in the German Cancer Research 
Center (where we were temporarily housed), 
and Erik Fries, a Swedish post-doctoral fel￾low, we studied what happened when SFV was 
added to cells in tissue culture. Using electron 
microscopy, we visualized virus particles 
binding to the cell surface, becoming inter￾nalized by coated vesicles and accumulating 
in intracellular vacuoles. Biochemical assays 
with radioactive virus particles demonstrated 
that endocytosis was rapid and efficient. We 
confirmed that infection was prevented by 
weak bases such as ammonium chloride and 
chloroquine, and showed that this involved 
inhibition of virus entry. However, these com￾pounds did not inhibit the endocytic uptake 
of SFV. To our disappointment, we had no 
evidence of fusion between host and virus 
membranes.
