Abstract
Intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) are common surgical emergencies and have been reported as major contributors
to non-trauma deaths in the emergency departments worldwide.
The cornerstones of effective treatment of IAIs are early recognition, adequate source control, and appropriate
antimicrobial therapy. Prompt resuscitation of patients with ongoing sepsis is of utmost important.
In hospitals worldwide, non-acceptance of, or lack of access to, accessible evidence-based practices and guidelines
result in overall poorer outcome of patients suffering IAIs.
The aim of this paper is to promote global standards of care in IAIs and update the 2013 WSES guidelines for
management of intra-abdominal infections.

Background
The world’s burden of emergency surgery diseases is
significant and appears to be increasing. Emergency ser￾vices and acute surgical care constitute a major gap in
the focus of the health sector worldwide, and several
issues need to be addressed in order to promote a global
dialogue on what is the most appropriate way to
configure acute care surgery worldwide [1]. Although
variations in the spectrum of surgical diseases are ob￾served among and within countries, “essential” surgery
and anaesthesia in emergency should be viewed as a core
group of services that can be delivered within the con￾text of universal access [1–3]. Particularly for the rural
populations in low- and middle-income countries
(LMICs), there are enormous gaps in access to life￾saving and disability-preventing surgical services [4–6].
Furthermore, many hospitals continue to have logistic bar￾riers associated with the application of evidence-based
practice. This may lead to an overall poorer adherence to
international guidelines, making them impractical to a
large part of the world’s population [7, 8].
Complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs) are an
important cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly
if poorly managed. A recent multi-center observational
study, conducted in 132 medical institutions worldwide
during a 4-month period (October 2014–February 2015)
enrolled 4553 patients with cIAIs [1]. The overall
mortality in this study was 9.2% (416/4533).
The aim of these guidelines is to present an evidence￾based international consensus position on the management
of IAIs, from collaboration of a panel of experts, with a
view to promoting the standards of care for the manage￾ment of IAIs worldwide.
Methods
These guidelines have been formulated by international
collaboration and discussion among an expert panel of
clinicians, practicing in the field of emergency surgery.
These consensus guidelines have been facilitated and co￾ordinated by the board of the World Society of Emer￾gency Surgery and are an update of the 2013 WSES
guidelines on this topic.
The statements are formulated and graded accord￾ing to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment,
Development and Evaluation (GRADE) hierarchy of
evidence from Guyatt and colleagues [9], summarized
in Table 1.
Principles of sepsis control
The key factors in the effective treatment of cIAIs are
(a) a prompt diagnosis, (b) adequate resuscitation, (c)
early initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy, (d) early
and effective source control, and finally, (e) reassessment
of the clinical response and appropriate adjustment of
the management strategy.
Abdominal sepsis represents the host’s systemic
inflammatory response to intra-abdominal infections.
Sepsis is a dynamic process that can evolve into
conditions of varying severity [10, 11]. The inflamma￾tory response in patients with sepsis depends on the
causative pathogen and the host (genetic characteris￾tics and co-existing illnesses), with differential
responses at local, regional, and systemic levels [11].
If left untreated, it may lead to the functional impair￾ment of one or more vital organs or systems. It was
previously defined that severity of illness and the
inherent mortality risk escalate from sepsis, through
severe sepsis and septic shock up multi-organ failure.
However, differences in the spectrum of etiology and
patient factors, including age and co-morbidities,
make the course of sepsis different from patient to
patient. Illustrating the importance of age, recent data
from a consecutive, population-based cohort of
patients with perforated gastroduodenal ulcer
(PGDU), showed that octa- and nona-genarians with
PGDU presented with fewer signs of peritonitis and
had an attenuated inflammatory response [12]. HIV
patients, common in sub-Saharan Africa, have an
increased risk to develop sepsis due to the HIV infec￾tion itself that affects several components of the im￾mune system involved in sepsis pathogenesis [13].
HIV causes increased susceptibility to invasive
infections and affects sepsis pathogenesis caused by
pre-existing activation and exhaustion of the immune
system [14], and even if HIV-infected patients on
antiretroviral therapy can now safely undergo major
abdominal surgery with encouraging results, they are
still relatively poorer than those of HIV-negative
subjects [15].
Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis
and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) has recently been published
[16] and updated previous classifications [17, 18]. Sepsis
is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused
by a dysregulated host response to infection. Organ
dysfunction can be represented by an increase in the
Sequential (sepsis-related) Organ Failure Assessment
(SOFA) score of 2 points or more. Septic shock should
be defined as a subset of sepsis and should be clinically
identified by a vasopressor requirement to maintain a
mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg or greater and
serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L (>18 mg/dL)
in the absence of hypovolemia. The definition of severe
sepsis is now superfluous. The new definition of sepsis
suggests that patients with at least 2 of these 3 clinical
variables: Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13 or less, systolic
blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or less, and respiratory rate
22/min or greater (quick SOFA - qSOFA) may be prone

to a poor outcome typical of sepsis and patients with posi￾tive qSOFA should be clinically characterized as septic by
SOFA score (Table 2). The SOFA score (Table 2) was
proposed in 1996 by the Working Group on Sepsis￾Related Problems of the European Society of Intensive
Care Medicine [19] to objectively describe the degree of
organ dysfunction over time and to evaluate morbidity in
intensive care unit (ICU) in patients with sepsis. It was
demonstrated to be a good indicator of prognosis in
critically ill patients during the first few days of ICU
admission [20].
Some concerns about the new definition of sepsis have
been reported [21].
Since the first classification in 1991 [17], the definitions
of sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock, though
imprecise, have provided to clinicians a useful framework
for clinical management, stressing the need for early rec￾ognition. The new definition of sepsis requiring the pres￾ence of organ failure has lost its predictive potential and
may hinder the awareness of the importance of early rec￾ognition and treatment of sepsis, de-emphasizing inter￾vention at earlier stages when it is most treatable, and
leading to a higher risk of delayed diagnosis. Early recog￾nition of sepsis is a general principle of sepsis manage￾ment and is very important in LMICs where the priorities
for improving quality of care of critically ill patients are
different.
Documenting the burden of critical illness in low￾resource settings is challenging. In these settings, a
robust triage system that quickly recognizes critically
ill patients and transfers them immediately to an
acute care unit are a vital component of the emer￾gency services [22].
Moreover in many areas worldwide, there are limited
resources for intensive investigations, as a consequence,
any process of improving quality of sepsis care globally
should focus on simple diagnostic criteria based on
physical examination findings that can recognize
patients needing critical care. In these settings, a feasible,
low-cost method of rapidly identifying patients requiring
critical care should be crucial.
Sepsis-3 definition introduces Quick SOFA (qSOFA)
as a tool for identifying patients at risk of sepsis with
a higher risk of hospital death both inside and
outside critical care units. However, qSOFA does not
define sepsis and the new sepsis definitions recom￾mend using an increase in the SOFA score of two
points or more to represent organ dysfunction. The
SOFA score is potentially not accessible everywhere,
especially for PaO2, which would require an arterial
blood gas measurement.
Early warning scores utilize physiological, easy-to￾measure parameters, assessing physiological parameters
such as systolic blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory
rate, temperature, oxygen saturations, and level of con￾sciousness [23].
In patients with intra-abdominal infections, early
warning scores associated with abdominal signs and
symptoms such as abdominal pain and abdominal rigidity
can screen patients needing immediate acute care surgery.
Finally, although some patients with ongoing sepsis
may not have elevated lactate levels at presentation or
during their clinical course [24, 25], lactate measurement
is advised as an important component of the initial evalu￾ation of patients with sepsis. Elevated lactate levels
(even if >4 mmol/l) are no longer part of organ dysfunc￾tion criteria to define sepsis. According to the new defin￾ition of sepsis, high lactate levels should be used only as
one of the criteria to define septic shock.

Early recognition of the patient with ongoing abdom￾inal sepsis is an essential step for an effective treatment.
Prompt administration of intravenous fluids for resus￾citation is critical in patients with an ongoing sepsis. This
initial resuscitation should be titrated to the clinical
response, and not solely guided by a predetermined
protocol. Vasopressor agents may serve to augment and
assist fluid resuscitation, particularly where this therapy
alone is failing (Recommendation 1A).
The data from WISS study showed that mortality was
significantly affected by sepsis––mortality by sepsis sta￾tus was no sepsis 1.2%, sepsis only 4.4%, severe sepsis
27.8%, and septic shock 67.8% [1].
Identifying patients with ongoing sepsis early and
correcting the underlying microvascular dysfunction
may improve patient outcomes. If not corrected, micro￾vascular dysfunction can lead to global tissue hypoxia,
direct tissue damage, and ultimately, organ failure [26].
Fluid therapy to improve microvascular blood flow
and increase cardiac output is an essential part of the
treatment of patients with sepsis. Crystalloid solutions
should be the first choice because they are well tolerated
and cheap [27]. They should be infused rapidly to induce
a quick response but not so fast that an artificial stress
response develops. They should be interrupted when no
improvement of tissue perfusion occurs in response to
volume loading. Basal lung crepitations may indicate
fluid overload or impaired cardiac function. Recently,
measuring inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter by ultra￾sound was suggested as a novel outcome measure to
guide this resuscitative approach [28].
The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) is a joint collab￾oration of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the
European Society of Intensive Care Medicine committed
to reducing mortality from severe sepsis and septic
shock worldwide in 2002. In 2012, the SSC updated its
guidelines. SSC guidelines have been regarded as the
standard of care in patients with severe sepsis and septic
shock in many hospitals worldwide [29]. However, the
possibility to implement the SSC guidelines has been
questioned in LMICs where simple and low-cost
standardized laboratory testing should be emphasized to
allow accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of
treatment response [30, 31]. A study conducted as an
anonymous questionnaire-based, cross-sectional survey
among anaesthesia providers, suggested that the most
recent SSC guidelines cannot be implemented in Africa,
particularly in Sub-Sahara Africa, due to a shortage of
required hospital facilities, equipment, drugs, and dis￾posable materials [32].
The 2016 Surviving Sepsis Campaign International
Guidelines for Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock
was recently published [33]. Previous iterations of these
guidelines aimed to treat the early hypovolemic phase of
sepsis by providing appropriate high volume resuscita￾tion targeting central venous pressure 8–12 mm Hg,
mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65 mm Hg, urine output
>0.5 mL/kg/h, central venous (superior vena cava) or
mixed venous oxygen saturation >70 or >65%, respect￾ively. Since the first draft of guidelines, the basic concept
of the initial resuscitation has been early goal-directed
therapy (EGDT) described by Rivers in 2001, who
reported that patients with severe sepsis and septic
shock presenting to the emergency department had a
lower mortality rate, if they received a specific 6-h
resuscitation bundle of EGDT [34]. Recent randomized
controlled trials (ProCESS, ARISE, and ProMISe trials)
results [35–37] have questioned River’s resuscitation
protocol results demonstrating that use of early goal￾directed therapy for patients presenting to the
emergency department with early septic shock did not
reduce mortality compared with usual care.
These data indicate that an early identification and
prompt administration of intravenous fluids are mandatory.
However, initial resuscitation should no longer be based on
a predetermined protocol but on clinical endpoints.
Hypotension is the most common indicator of inad￾equate perfusion. The SSC advocated a mean arterial
pressure (MAP) goal of 65 mm Hg during the first 6 h
of treatment. It was confirmed by a randomized
controlled trial “Sepsis and Mean Arterial Pressure”
(SEPSISPAM) examining high versus low MAP goals in
patients with septic shock. It demonstrated that target￾ing a mean arterial pressure of 80–85 mm Hg, as
compared with 65–70 mm Hg, in patients with septic
shock undergoing resuscitation did not result in signifi￾cant differences in mortality at either 28 or 90 days [38].
Particularly in patients with abdominal sepsis, requir￾ing urgent surgical intervention, overly aggressive fluid
resuscitation may increase intra-abdominal pressure and
worsen the inflammatory response, which is associated
with a high risk of complications [39, 40]. In patients
with septic shock fluid infusion during resuscitation,
bowel oedema and forced closure of the abdominal wall
can cause intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal
compartment syndrome that can consequently modify
pulmonary, cardiovascular, renal, splanchnic, and central
nervous system physiology causing significant morbidity
and mortality. Clinical endpoints in monitoring fluid
volume infusions should include mean arterial pressure,
skin color and capillary refill, mental status, or urinary
output. Central venous access, where available, may be
helpful for monitoring of central venous pressure. Simpler
non-invasive devices such as tissue perfusion monitors
may be more practical but are not yet widely used.
Repeated measurements of IVC diameter by ultrasound
can be a simple and useful method for defining fluid
requirements [28].
Sartelli et al. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017) 12:29 Page 5 of 34

Vasopressor agents should be administered to restore
organ perfusion if fluid resuscitation fails optimizing
blood flow and if hypotension persists following fluid
loading. These agents should be globally available.
Vasopressor and inotropic agents have increasingly be￾come a therapeutic cornerstone for the management of
sepsis. They have excitatory and inhibitory actions on
the heart and vascular smooth muscle, as well as import￾ant metabolic, central nervous system, and presynaptic
autonomic nervous system effects. The optimal timing
of vasopressors relative to fluid infusion has been
debated. Recently, a large multi-center retrospective
analysis of 2849 patients with septic shock, investigators
found that mortality was lowest when vasopressors were
delayed by 1 h and infused from hours 1 to 6 following
onset of shock [41]. Norepinephrine is now the first-line
vasopressor agent used to correct hypotension in the
event of septic shock [29]. Norepinephrine is more
efficacious than dopamine and may be more effective for
reversing hypotension in patients with septic shock [29].
Dopamine may cause more tachycardia and may be
more arrhythmogenic than norepinephrine, and as an al￾ternative vasopressor agent to norepinephrine, it should
be used only in patients with low risk of tachyarrhyth￾mias and absolute or relative bradycardia.
Dobutamine is an inotropic agent used to treat septic
shock patients increasing cardiac output, stroke index, and
oxygen delivery (DO2). It has been suggested to be adminis￾tered to pre-existing vasopressor therapy in the presence of
myocardial dysfunction, defined as elevated cardiac filling
pressures and low cardiac output. However, dobutamine
increases DO2 to supranormal values and in critically ill pa￾tients, it has raised serious questions regarding its safety in
the treatment of septic shock. Because dobutamine pro￾vides direct stimulation of the β-1 adrenergic receptors, it is
recognized as more problematic with regard to tachycardia
and arrhythmia.
In LMICs, it may be acceptable to use adrenaline
infusions as the inotrope of choice, given it is readily avail￾able, cheap, and has been shown to be equivalent to
noradrenaline in septic shock [42].
Increased global availability of vasopressors together
with a better understanding of their indications, pharma￾codynamics, and important adverse effects are mandatory
to fight sepsis worldwide.
Diagnosis
A step-up approach for diagnosis from clinical and
laboratory examination, to imaging examination should
be used and tailored to the hospitals resources (Recom￾mendation 1B).
The diagnosis of intra-abdominal infections is based
primarily on clinical assessment. Typically, the patient is
admitted to the emergency department with abdominal
pain and a systemic inflammatory response, including
fever, tachycardia, and tachypnoea. Abdominal rigidity
suggests the presence of peritonitis. Hypotension and
hypoperfusion signs such as lactic acidosis, oliguria, and
acute alteration of mental status are indicative of
ongoing sepsis.
In many countries worldwide, a large proportion of
patients with diffuse peritonitis still present to the
hospital with unacceptable delay. This event reduces the
percentage of surviving at the lowest rates in the world
[8]. In emergency departments of limited-resource
hospitals, the diagnosis of intra-abdominal infections is
mainly clinical; supported by basic laboratory tests like
full blood count (complete blood count). Ultrasonog￾raphy is sometimes done to aid diagnosis, if available.
Therefore, the clinician has to improve clinical diagnosis
by looking carefully for those signs and symptoms. In
rural and remote areas of LMICs, diagnostic imaging is
often insufficient, and in some instances, completely
lacking [43]. In recent years, ultrasound use has
increased worldwide, facilitated by ultrasound machines
becoming smaller, more reliable, and less expensive [44].
Ultrasound is reproducible and can be easily repeated,
but remains highly user-dependent, and thus, experience
should be taken into account for diagnostic accuracy
and reliability.
In rural areas of LMICs with limited access to surgical
care and CT, plain X-ray abdomen and ultrasound can
help to identify and diagnose surgical emergencies cost￾effectively, allowing efficient use of resources [45, 46].
CT may be very useful especially when the diagno￾sis is uncertain. In high-income countries, it has
become the gold standard. In 2006, a meta-analysis
by Doria et al. demonstrated that CT imaging fea￾tured significantly higher sensitivity and resolution
than ultrasound in studies of both children and adults
with acute appendicitis [47].
Proposals of staged algorithmics with a step-up
approach with CT performed after an inconclusive or
negative US were proposed in the setting of acute
appendicitis and acute diverticulitis [48–51].
Source control
The timing and adequacy of source control are
important in the management of intra-abdominal
infections; late and/or incomplete procedures may
have severely adverse consequences on outcome
especially in critically ill patients.
IAIs include several different pathological conditions
and are usually classified into uncomplicated and compli￾cated [52]. In uncomplicated IAIs, the infectious process
only involves a single organ and does not proceed to peri￾toneum. Patients with such infections can be managed
Sartelli et al. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017) 12:29 Page 6 of 34

with either surgical source control or with antibiotics
alone. In complicated IAIs (cIAIs), the infectious process
extends beyond the organ and causes either localized peri￾tonitis or diffuse peritonitis. The treatment of patients
with complicated intra-abdominal infections involves both
source control and antibiotic therapy.
Peritonitis is classified into primary, secondary, or tertiary
peritonitis [52]. Primary peritonitis is a diffuse bacterial
infection without loss of integrity of the gastrointestinal
tract in absence of an identifiable source of infection during
surgical exploration; this is rare, and mainly occurs in in￾fancy and early childhood as well as in cirrhotic patients.
Secondary peritonitis, the most common form of periton￾itis, is an acute peritoneal infection resulting from loss of
integrity of the gastrointestinal tract or from infected vis￾cera. It is caused by perforation of the gastrointestinal tract
(e.g., perforated duodenal ulcer) by direct invasion from in￾fected intra-abdominal viscera (e.g., gangrenous appendi￾citis). Anastomotic dehiscences are common causes of
secondary peritonitis in the postoperative period. Tertiary
peritonitis is a recurrent infection of the peritoneal cavity
that follows either primary or secondary peritonitis. It is a
complication of a secondary peritonitis and may be termed
also “ongoing peritonitis” or “persistent” peritonitis [53, 54].
As a general principle, the most established source of in￾fection should be totally controlled as soon as possible.
However, source control requires general anaesthesia that
may not be readily available in some areas of the world. In
many rural areas, patients must be centralized to urban
centers with the loss of much time, largely due to trans￾port delays. Furthermore, the urgency of intervention is
also affected by the rapidity of the evolution of clinical
symptoms.
Source control encompasses all measures undertaken to
eliminate the source of infection, reduce the bacterial in￾oculum, and correct or control anatomic derangements to
restore normal physiologic function [55, 56]. The primary
objectives of intervention include (a) determining the cause
of peritonitis, (b) draining fluid collections, and (c) control￾ling the origin of the abdominal sepsis. This endeavor
generally involves drainage of abscesses or infected fluid
collections, debridement of necrotic or infected tissues, and
definitive control of the source of contamination. Control
of the septic source can be achieved either by surgical or
non-surgical means. Non-surgical interventional proce￾dures imply percutaneous drainages of abscesses, when it is
available. Ultrasound and CT-guided percutaneous drain￾age of abdominal and extraperitoneal abscesses in selected
patients are safe and effective [57–61]. Surgical source
control includes resection or suture of a diseased or
perforated viscus (e.g., diverticular perforation, gastro￾duodenal perforation), removal of the infected organ
(e.g., appendix, gallbladder), debridement of necrotic
tissue, resection of ischemic bowel, and repair/resection
of traumatic perforations with primary anastomosis or
exteriorization of the bowel.
In recent years, laparoscopy has been gaining wider
acceptance in the diagnosis and treatment of intra￾abdominal infections. The laparoscopic approach in the
treatment of peritonitis is feasible for many emergency
conditions. It has the advantage to allow, at the same
time, an adequate diagnosis and appropriate treatment
with a less invasive abdominal approach [62]. However,
laparoscopy due to the increase of intra-abdominal pres￾sure due to pneumoperitoneum, may have a negative
effect in critically ill patients leading to acid–base bal￾ance disturbances, as well as changes in cardiovascular
and pulmonary physiology [40]. Laparoscopy is still
uncommon in many areas of the world for several rea￾sons, a major one being cost. In these countries, the
challenges posed by the burden of primary healthcare
concerns have limited government support for develop￾ment of modern tertiary healthcare facilities, and laparo￾scopic surgery is practiced in only a few tertiary
hospitals. Innovative programs to train surgeons and
develop low-cost equipment in these countries are en￾couraging [63]. Some studies in the literature have
focused on the feasibility of implementing laparoscopic
procedures in resource-poor countries, and how to over￾come the challenges involved [64–66].
Etiological factors of peritonitis show a wide geographical
variation and different spectrum in the various regions of
the world. Table 3 summarizes the sources of infection in
the recent international WISS Study [1].

WISS study [1] confirmed acute appendicitis as the most
frequent cause of intra-abdominal sepsis and demon￾strated that around one-third of these cases were compli￾cated. Interestingly, the incidence of acute appendicitis
varies: it is generally thought to have a low-incidence rate
in sub-Saharan Africa and in many regions of Asia and
Latin America. This condition once thought to be rare in
many regions of the world, but appears to be increasing in
many urban centers and also in LMICs, perhaps due to
changes in life style and diet [65]. However, the true
incidence of appendicitis in many areas of the world is
unknown due to poor medical record-keeping and unreli￾able population census. In 2015, a retrospective study over
a 4-year period in South Africa [66] reported over half
(56%) were from the urban district within the city of
Pietermaritzburg and the remaining 44% were from the
rural health district. The median duration of illness from
onset to definitive care was 4 days. Sixty percent of appen￾dices were perforated and associated with intra-abdominal
contamination. Forty percent of patients required reopera￾tion to control intra-abdominal sepsis. Ten percent
required admission to the intensive care unit. The median
overall length of hospital stay was 5 days. The mortality
rate was 1%. Rural patients had a longer median duration
of illness (3 versus 5 days, p < 0.001) as well as a more
advanced disease profile associated with perforation and
severe intra-abdominal sepsis (19 versus 71%, p < 0.001).
The natural history of appendicitis has been described in
three stages: (1) a normal appendix, (2) uncomplicated
acute appendicitis, and (3) complicated appendicitis,
according to their macroscopic and microscopic appear￾ance and clinical relevance [67]. The high morbidity and
occasional mortality associated with acute appendicitis are
related to delay in presentation by patients or delay in
diagnosis by the clinician. These delays may result in
complications like gangrene, perforation, appendiceal mass,
and peritonitis, all of which would prolong hospital stay
and increase the cost of treatment.
Unfortunately, the clinical presentation of appendi￾citis is often inconsistent. While the clinical diagnosis
may be clear in patients presenting with classic signs
and symptoms, atypical presentations may result in
delay in treatment. Therefore, diagnostic scoring
systems have been described with the aim to provide
clinical probabilities that a patient has acute appendi￾citis. The development of these scores may contribute
to diagnosis and by easily applicable clinical criteria
and simple laboratory tests a score which classifies
the probability of diagnosis may be attributed to the
patient. In 1986, Alvarado published his own method
for the early diagnosis of acute appendicitis [68]. A
score of five or six was compatible with the diagnosis of
acute appendicitis, a score of seven or eight indicated a
probable appendicitis, and a score of nine or ten indicated
a very probable appendicitis. The only laboratory tests
needed in the initial evaluation for acute appendicitis was
a complete blood count to determine if there was shift to
the left or increased segmented neutrophils (more than
75%) [69]. The more recently introduced appendicitis in￾flammatory response (AIR) score incorporated the C￾reactive protein value in its design and was developed and
validated on a prospective cohort of patients with suspi￾cion of acute appendicitis. It was based on similar values
to the Alvarado score, but it also included C-reactive pro￾tein as a new variable [70].
Recently, WSES guidelines for diagnosis and treatment
of acute appendicitis were published [71]
Appendectomy remains the treatment of choice also for
acute appendicitis. Antibiotic therapy is a safe means of
primary treatment for patients with uncomplicated acute
appendicitis, but it is less effective in the long-term due
to significant recurrence rates and probably needs the
certainty of a CT proven diagnosis of uncomplicated ap￾pendicitis (Recommendation 1A).
Antibiotics alone may be useful to treat patients with
early, non-perforated appendicitis, even if there is a risk of
recurrence [71, 72]. In the APPAC (Antibiotic Therapy
versus Appendectomy for Treatment of Uncomplicated
Acute Appendicitis) trial recently published in JAMA [73]
enrolling 530 patients with uncomplicated appendicitis
confirmed by a CT-scan (257 antibiotic therapy, 273 ap￾pendectomy), the 1-year recurrence rate and appendec￾tomy in the antibiotic group was reported as 27%.
Although antibiotic therapy can be successful in selected
patients with uncomplicated appendicitis, the risk of dis￾ease recurrence limits the application of this treatment
strategy. Apart from this high recurrence rate, the need
for additional diagnostic certainty with a CT-proven diag￾nosis further complicates this approach [74]. Finally, in
this era of antimicrobial resistance, antibiotic overuse
should be limited. For all these reasons, appendectomy
has remained in international guidelines the gold-standard
treatment for acute appendicitis worldwide [75].
Both open and laparoscopic appendectomies are viable
approaches to surgical treatment of acute appendicitis
(Recommendation 1A).
The advent of laparoscopy has modified the surgical
treatment of acute appendicitis in high-income countries.
In contrast, in many areas of the world, the challenges
posed by the burden of primary healthcare concerns have
limited support for development of modern tertiary
healthcare facilities, and laparoscopic surgery is practiced
in only a few tertiary hospitals. In the last years, several
prospective randomized studies, meta-analyses, and sys￾tematic critical reviews have been published on the topics
of laparoscopic appendectomy. Laparoscopic appendec￾tomy is safe and effective, but open surgery still confers
benefits, in particular with regard to the likelihood of
Sartelli et al. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017) 12:29 Page 8 of 34

postoperative intra-abdominal abscess. In a meta-analysis
by Li et al. [76] including 44 randomized controlled trials
with 5292 patients laparoscopic appendectomy (LA)
provided considerable benefits over open appendectomy
(OA), including a shorter length of hospital stay, less post￾operative pain, earlier postoperative recovery, and a lower
complication rate. However, LA was associated with a
slight increase in the incidence of intra-abdominal abscess,
intra-operative bleeding and urinary tract infection.
Sauerland et al. [77] performed a meta-analysis including
67 studies, of which 56 compared LA (with or without
diagnostic laparoscopy) versus OA in adults wound
infections were less likely after LA than after OA, but the
incidence of intra-abdominal abscesses was increased. In a
prospective study published in 2010, Tzovaras et al. found
that the postoperative length of hospital stay did not differ
significantly between OA and LA for men. Laparoscopic
appendectomy required more time and did not offer any
advantages compared with OA in men [78].
Patients with a periappendiceal abscess can be man￾aged with percutaneous image-guided drainage in surgi￾cal departments with ready access to diagnostic and
interventional radiology. When percutaneous drainage is
not available surgery is suggested (Recommendation 1B).
In approximately 10% of patients, a periappendiceal
abscess and inflammatory phlegmon is present at diagnosis.
This is more frequently encountered in the situation of a
delayed diagnosis. Clinical features of complicated appendi￾citis such as mass and abscess may include fever, tachycar￾dia, palpation of mass, and extension of area of tenderness
and rebound. Surgical management varies because a
proportion of these cases will evolve into an ileocecal resec￾tion or a right-sided hemicolectomy if operated in the acute
setting [79]. In recent years, high success rates of 76–97%
[80] and low incidences of complications have been
reported in patients with appendicitis associated with
abscess and/or mass, after conservative management; thus,
performing non-surgical treatments, such as antibiotic
therapy and percutaneous drainage, during the initial
period have been proven to be effective and safe [81–84].
However, a necessary condition for conservative manage￾ment of these patients is an easy access to diagnostic and
interventional radiology to perform a percutaneous drain￾age. When percutaneous drainage is not available, surgery
is suggested [85, 86].
In patients treated conservatively, interval appendec￾tomy may be not necessary following initial non￾operative treatment of complicated appendicitis. How￾ever, interval appendectomies should always be per￾formed for patients with recurrent symptoms
(Recommendation 2B).
Traditionally, an interval appendectomy has been of￾fered to patients who initially underwent a non-operative
approach to their appendiceal mass. However, the role of
the interval appendectomy has been questioned, and
controversy continues whether interval appendectomy is
appropriate for adults with an appendiceal abscess. The
main debate revolves around the recurrence rate, the
complication rate of an interval appendectomy, and the
potential for underlying malignancy. The results of a
review by Andersonn and Petzold, based mainly on
retrospective studies, supported the practice of non￾surgical treatment without interval appendectomy in
patients with appendiceal abscess or phlegmon [81].
However, the patient should be informed about the risk of
recurrence especially in the presence of appendicolith.
The risk of missing another underlying condition (cancer
or Crohn disease) is low, but motivates a colonoscopy in
patients above the age of 40 years.
Routine use of intraoperative irrigation for appendecto￾mies does not prevent intra-abdominal abscess formation
and may be avoided (Recommendation 2B).
In 2011, a retrospective review of 176 consecutive ap￾pendectomies, open (39%) and laparoscopic (61%), at a
university-affiliated tertiary care facility from July 2007
to November 2008 investigated routine use of intra￾operative irrigation for appendectomies. The results did
not show a decrease in postoperative intra-abdominal
abscess with the use of intra-operative irrigation. Thir￾teen patients developed postoperative abscess: 11 with
irrigation and two without irrigation. Ten of 13 patients
who developed abscess were perforated; nine with irriga￾tion and one without [87].
Acute left colonic diverticulitis
Acute sigmoid diverticulitis is a common disease of the
Western World and results in a significant number of
hospital admissions. Data from Western populations
suggest that up to one fifth of patients with acute diver￾ticulitis are under the age of 50 years of age [88, 89].
Recent evidence suggests that lifetime risk of developing
acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis (ALCD) is only about
4% among patients with diverticulosis [90].
Recent WSES guidelines for the management of
acute diverticulitis in the emergency setting were
published [91].
Clinical findings of patients having ALCD include
acute pain or tenderness in the left lower quadrant,
which may be associated with increased inflammatory
markers including C-reactive protein (CRP) and white
blood cell count (WBC). However, the clinical diagnosis
of ALCD lacks accuracy: in a prospective analysis [92]
conducted on 802 consecutive patients that presented
with abdominal pain to the emergency department, posi￾tive and negative predictive values of clinical diagnosis
were 0.65 and 0.98, respectively. Additional cross￾sectional imaging had a positive and negative predictive
value of more than 0.95 and 0.99, respectively. Radiology
Sartelli et al. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017) 12:29 Page 9 of 34

examinations improved the diagnostic accuracy in 37%
of the patients, although only changed the management
in 7%.
Antibiotics can be avoided in patients with CT findings
of uncomplicated ALCD and without significant comorbid
conditions or signs of sepsis. Patients should be clinically
monitored to assess for resolution of the inflammatory
processes (Recommendation 1A).
ALCD is generally divided into uncomplicated and compli￾cated. The utility of antimicrobial therapy in acute uncompli￾cated diverticulitis has been a point of controversy in the
international medical community [93]. In terms of clinical
resolution, recent investigation demonstrates that antimicro￾bial treatment was not superior to withholding antibiotic
therapy in patients with mild, unperforated diverticulitis. Fur￾thermore, a multi-center randomized trial involving ten sur￾gical departments in Sweden and one in Iceland, recruited
623 patients with computed tomography-verified acute un￾complicated left-sided diverticulitis [94], and concluded that
antibiotic treatment for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis
neither accelerated recovery nor prevented complications or
recurrence. In these studies, the definition of uncomplicated
ALCD is based on strict CT scan definitions: for example,
patients with pericolic free gas or even minimal free fluid
were classified as having complicated disease and were ex￾cluded from investigation [95].
On the basis of clinical conditions, patients with diver￾ticular smaller abscesses may be treated by antibiotics
alone (Recommendation 1C).
Patients with abscesses having a large diameter should
be treated by percutaneous drainage and intravenous an￾tibiotics (Recommendation 1C).
Whenever percutaneous drainage of the abscess is not
feasible or not available, based on the clinical conditions
patients with large abscesses can be initially treated by
antibiotic therapy alone. However careful clinical moni￾toring is mandatory (Recommendation 1C).
Approximately 15–20% of patients admitted with ALCD
have an abscess [96], and the treatment should be either
antibiotics with or without percutaneous and/or surgical
drainage. The use of antibiotics and percutaneous drainage
in the management of diverticular abscesses facilitates
single-stage operation to perform subsequently an elective
sigmoidectomy. The size of 3–6 cm has been generally ac￾cepted, despite the low level of evidence, to be a reasonable
limit between antimicrobial versus percutaneous drainage
in the management of diverticular abscesses [96–100].
A retrospective study assessing the effectiveness of antibi￾otics as sole initial therapy in patients with large diverticular
abscess was published in 2015 by Elagili et al. [101]. Thir￾ty-two patients were managed by antibiotics alone while
114 underwent percutaneous drainage.
Failure of initial treatment required urgent surgery in
eight patients with persistent symptoms during treatment
with antibiotics alone (25%) and in 21 patients (18%) after
initial percutaneous drainage (p = 0.21). Patients treated
with antibiotics had a significantly smaller abscess diam￾eter (5.9 versus 7.1 cm, p = 0.001). Postoperative complica￾tions in patients treated with antibiotics alone were
significantly less severe than after percutaneous drainage
based on the Clavien-Dindo classification (p = 0.04).
Hartmann’s procedure remains useful in the manage￾ment of diffuse peritonitis in critically ill patients. However,
in clinically stable patients, primary resection with anasto￾mosis, with or without a diverting stoma, may be per￾formed (Recommendation 1B).
Hartmann’s procedure has been considered the proced￾ure of choice in patients with generalized peritonitis and
remains a safe technique for emergency colectomy in di￾verticular peritonitis, especially in critically ill patients and
in patients with multiple co-morbidities. However, restor￾ation of bowel continuity after Hartmann’s procedure has
been associated with significant morbidity [102]. In recent
years, some authors have reported the role of primary
resection and anastomosis with or without a diverting
stoma in stable patients without comorbidity, even in the
presence of diffuse peritonitis [103]. Studies comparing
mortality and morbidity of Hartmann’s procedure versus
primary anastomosis did not show any significant differ￾ences. However, most studies had relevant selection bias
as demonstrated by four systematic reviews [103–107].
Laparoscopic peritoneal lavage and drainage may not
be considered the treatment of choice in patients with
diffuse peritonitis (Recommendation 1A).
Recent investigation continues to define the role of lap￾aroscopic peritoneal lavage in the treatment of ALCD, and
unanswered questions remain. The latest prospective tri￾als, including the SCANDIV, Ladies, and DILALA trials
[108–111], have lacked superiority for lavage in terms of
morbidity, but mortality was not compromised. A meta￾analysis published in 2015 showed that in acute perforated
diverticulitis with purulent peritonitis laparoscopic lavage
is comparable to sigmoid resection in terms of mortality,
but it is associated with a significantly higher rate of
reoperations and a higher rate of intra-abdominal abscess
[111]. No differences in terms of mortality were demon￾strated at follow-up.
Colonic carcinoma perforation
Treatments for perforated colonic carcinoma should both
stabilize the emergency condition of the peritonitis and
fulfil the technical objectives of oncological intervention
(Recommendation 1B).
Patients with perforated colonic carcinoma had a signifi￾cantly poorer prognosis compared with patients with
non-perforated colonic cancer. Colorectal cancer-induced
perforation is considered an advanced stage disease due to
Sartelli et al. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017) 12:29 Page 10 of 34

the potential for peritoneal dissemination of tumor cells
throughout the site of perforation [112, 113].
The stage of illness, proximity of the perforation to the
tumor, and the number of metastatic lymph nodes are
positively correlated with reduced procedural- and cancer￾free survival rates [114].
Hartmann’s procedure has been widely accepted as an
effective means of treating carcinoma of the left colon
(with adequate R0 resection) in certain emergency sce￾narios [115].
Colonic perforation following colonoscopy
Patients presenting with diffuse peritonitis caused by
colonoscopic perforation should undergo immediate sur￾gical intervention, which typically involves primary re￾pair or resection (Recommendation 1B).
Recently, the frequency of colonic perforation has
increased due to routinely performed advanced therapeutic
endoscopy. The recent advent of endoscopic submucosal
dissection (ESD) has resulted in a high incidence of perfor￾ation, although the indication for endoscopic therapy of
colorectal neoplasm has been expanded.
Over the last decade, many advancements have
been streamlined to better address these perforations,
yet there are no definitive guidelines for their optimal
management [116].
Endoscopic management is typically used to treat
colonoscopy-associated perforations if they can be
closed by endoscopic clipping during colonoscopy
[117–119].
Retrospective studies showed that conservative man￾agement of colonoscopic perforation could be an option
for patients without overt symptoms of peritonitis or
with a small defect size [120, 121].
Early exploratory laparotomy with primary closure or
bowel resection has been the standard treatment of colo￾noscopic perforation [122]. In cases of extensive con￾tamination, poor tissue quality and a higher
complication rate, stoma, or fecal diversion after repair
should be performed [123].
Iqbal et al. in a retrospective study [124] indicated
that factors predicting a poor outcome included de￾layed diagnosis, extensive peritoneal contamination,
and patients using anticoagulants (p < .05).
An early laparoscopic approach may be a safe and ef￾fective option for colonoscopy-related colonic perforation
for experienced surgeons (Recommendation 2B).
Laparoscopic surgery is a compromise that may minimize
the risks of invasive surgery as well as those of insufficiently
aggressive non-operative therapy [125–128].
In the Zhang et al. study, their experience in laparo￾scopic direct suturing of colon perforations indicated
that laparoscopic primary perforation repair was a safe
and feasible repair method [127].
If the area of perforation cannot be localized laparo￾scopically, the surgeon should begin with a laparotomy
before proceeding further [128].
Gastroduodenal peptic ulcer perforations
Gastroduodenal ulcer perforations have decreased in the
last few years, largely due to the widespread adoption of
medical therapies for peptic ulcer disease and decreasing
incidence of helicobacter pylori infection in Western
countries. However, ulcer disease is a still common
emergency condition worldwide and is associated with
mortality rates of up to 30% [129, 130]. The main etiologic
factors include use of non-stereoidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs), steroids, smoking, Helicobacter pylori (H.
pylori) and a diet high in salt. All these factors have in com￾mon that they affect acid secretion in the gastric mucosa
[129]. Stress ulcers with perforation may occur in critically
ill patients in intensive care, where the diagnosis may be
obscured owing to lack of signs and symptoms in an
unconscious or sedated patient.
Surgery is the treatment of choice for perforated peptic
ulcers (Recommendation 1A).
Simple closure with or without an omental patch is a
safe and effective procedure to address small perforated
ulcers (<2 cm) (Recommendation 1A).
Surgery is the most effective means of source control
in patients with PPU [131]. The main surgical treatment
for PPU has become simple suture of the perforation site
with or without the addition of an omental patch [132].
In 2010, Lo et al. conducted a study to determine if an
omental patch offers any clinical benefit that is not
offered by simple closure alone [133]. The study demon￾strated that, in terms of leakage rates and overall surgical
outcome, covering the repaired perforated peptic ulcer
with an omental patch did not convey additional advan￾tages compared to simple closure alone.
Scoring systems to predict disease severity or outcome
in patients with gastroduodenal perforations are unreliable
and not accurate and cannot be generalized from one
population to another [133, 134].
Laparoscopic repair of perforated peptic ulcers can be
a safe and effective procedure for experienced surgeons
(Recommendation 1A).
Successful laparoscopic repair of perforated gastric
and duodenal ulcers has been reported, though the tech￾nique has yet to be universally accepted. The literature
was summarized in a recent systematic review [135].
The authors concluded that laparoscopic surgery results
are not clinically different from those of open surgery.
Further data is required to investigate the potentially
long learning curve seen among participating surgeons.
Conservative treatment for PPU is seldom reported
and restricted mostly to case reports and series, [136].

Small bowel perforations
Small bowel perforations are a less common source of
peritonitis in the Western countries, compared with
LMICs. In Western countries, most small intestinal
perforations are due to unrecognized intestinal ischemia
(mesenteric or strangulation) or inflammatory bowel
disease such as Crohn disease. This pattern of disease is
quite different to LMICs, where small bowel perforations
are usually due to typhoid fever. Typhoid fever remains
endemic in Asia, Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean,
and Oceania [137]. Ileal perforation as complication of
typhoid fever and enteritis is a major public health
problem in many areas worldwide because of its persistent
high morbidity and mortality. Typhoid ileal perforations
have a mortality rate up to 60% [138]. In the CIAOW
study, according to stepwise multivariate analysis, the
presence of small bowel perforation was an independent
variable predictive of mortality [139]. The most common
clinical presentation of enteric perforation is abdominal
pain and fever whereas perforation typically occurs in the
third week of disease. Lack of an incidence database and
poor financial resources preclude adequate prevention of
this public health menace [140]. The preoperative diagno￾sis of perforation usually is based on findings of peritonitis
in a patient with a history of prolonged febrile illness. In a
prospective study, 53 consecutive patients with typhoid
perforation were surgically treated; the morbidity rate for
this series of procedures was 49.1%, and the most
common post-operative complications included wound
infection, wound dehiscence, burst abdomen, residual
intra-abdominal abscesses, and entero-cutaneous fistulae.
The mortality rate was 15.1% and was significantly
affected by the presence of multiple perforations, severe
peritoneal contamination, and burst abdomen [141].
Surgery is the treatment of choice for patients with
small bowel perforations (Recommendation 1B).
In the event of small perforations, primary repair is
recommended (Recommendation 1B).
There are many methods of surgical treatment of small
bowel perforation, including primary closure, excision and
closure, resection and primary anastomosis, limited right
hemicolectomy, and stoma creation [142]. Primary repair
should be performed for patients with minor symptoms
and with perioperative findings of minimal peritoneal
contamination of the peritoneal cavity [75]. In the setting
of typhoidal perforation, although closure in two layers of
single perforation with relatively healthy tissue after
refreshment of the edge seems an acceptable option [143],
resection of the unhealthy tissue segment with primary
anastomosis of healthy edges about 10 cm on each side of
the perforation is recommended [144, 145].
In delayed cases with diffuse peritonitis, there can be
severe inflammation and oedema of the bowel, resulting
in friable tissue which precludes anastomosis, and
therefore, an ileostomy should be performed as a life sav￾ing measure [75]. Laparoscopic management of small
bowel perforations was reported, but there was no com￾parative study with open surgery [146].
Other infections that may rarely cause small bowel
perforation in immuno-compromised patients include
amoebic infection, Clostridium difficile, Cytomegalovirus,
and Histoplasmosis [147–150]. Rarely, medications
(NSAIDs, potassium chloride, and steroids), cancer
chemotherapy and radiotherapy may lead to small bowel
perforation.
Abdominal tuberculosis
Tuberculosis (TB) remains prevalent worldwide. It is
considered as a global health problem by the World
Health Organization and is considered the most import￾ant communicable disease in the world.
Although much of the burden is concentrated in high￾burden settings in Asia and Africa, TB continues to be of
concern in high-income nations. The number of tubercu￾losis cases has also been increasing in high-income
countries, mainly because of immigration and as a
consequence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
(AIDS) and also because of the utilization of immunosup￾pressive drugs [151].
Abdominal involvement in tuberculosis is the most
common extra-pulmonary form of this infection.
The most common site of extra pulmonary tuberculosis
is the ileocecal region and terminal ileum [151].
The clinical presentation of tuberculosis is variable
and non-specific, with non-pathognomonic signs and
symptoms. It may mimic other infectious or inflam￾matory pathological diseases, and even neoplastic
conditions [151, 152].
The most common complication of small bowel tuber￾culosis is obstruction due to the narrowing of the lumen
by ileocecal tuberculosis or stricture of small intestine
and perforation in ulcerative type of tuberculosis.
In the case of abdominal tuberculosis perforation
resection of the affected area and anastomosis may be
the treatment of choice rather than primary closure
(Recommendation 1C).
Treatment of tubercular perforation of ileum depends
upon the condition of the gut, general condition of the
patient and number of perforations. The resection of the
affected area and anastomosis may be the treatment of
choice rather than primary closure [152].
Acute calculous cholecystitis
Cholelithiasis is a common disorder all over the world
[153–155]. Its prevalence varies widely by region: in
Western countries, the prevalence of gallstone disease
reportedly ranges from approximately 7.9% in men to
16.6% in women [155]; in Asia, it ranges from
Sartelli et al. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017) 12:29 Page 12 of 34

approximately 3 to 15%, is nearly non-existent (less than
5%) in Africa [156], and ranges from 4.21 to 11% in
China.
Acute cholecystitis develops in 1–3% of patients with
symptomatic gallstones [157].
In 2016, WSES guidelines for the management of acute
calculous cholecystitis (AAC) were published [153].
The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis is made on the
basis of clinical features such as right upper quadrant
pain, fever, and leukocytosis and is supported by
findings from relevant imaging studies. Ultrasound is
the investigation of choice in patients suspected of
having acute cholecystitis [158]. Ultrasound typically
shows pericholecystic fluid (fluid around the gall
bladder), distended gall bladder, oedematous gallblad￾der wall, and gall stones, and Murphy’s sign can be
elicited on ultrasound examination [158]. Treatment
is predominantly surgical, although the timing of
surgery without evidence of gangrene or perforation
has been under debate in recent years. Two
approaches are available for the treatment of acute
cholecystitis: the early option, generally within 7 days
of onset of symptoms, offers a laparoscopic cholecyst￾ectomy (LC) to provide immediate, definitive surgical
treatment after establishing diagnosis and surgical fitness
of the patient in the same hospital admission, while the
delayed treatment option is performed in a second hos￾pital admission after an interval of 6–12 weeks during
which time the acute inflammation settles [159].
Early cholecystectomy is a safe treatment for acute
cholecystitis and generally results in shorter recovery time
and hospitalization compared to delayed cholecystecto￾mies (Recommendation 1A).
Several randomized controlled trials have investigated
early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ELC) versus delayed
laparoscopic cholecystectomy (DLC) and meta-analysis
[160–168]. A recent meta-analysis comparing early versus
delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecyst￾itis [169] reported on 16 studies, involving 1625 patients:
for patients with acute cholecystitis, ELC appears as safe
and effective as DLC. ELC might be associated with lower
hospital costs, fewer work days lost, and greater patient
satisfaction.
Among patients with uncomplicated cholecystitis, if
source control is complete, no postoperative antimicro￾bial therapy is necessary [170].
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a safe and effective
treatment for acute cholecystitis (Recommendation 1A).
It is the first choice for patients with acute cholecystitis
where adequate resources and skill are available. Some
risk factors may predict the risk for conversion to open
cholecystectomy.
Multiple prospective trials have demonstrated that the
laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a safe and effective
treatment for acute cholecystitis [171–174]. As a result,
immediate laparoscopic cholecystectomy has largely
become the therapy of choice for acute cholecystitis in
operable patients. While the laparoscopic approach is usual,
several risk factors predicting the need to convert to an
open approach are reported. In an evaluation of preopera￾tive risk factors as markers for conversion, a meta-analysis
summarizing 11 nRCTs containing 14,645 patients, re￾ported age >65 years, male gender, acute cholecystitis,
thickened gallbladder wall, diabetes mellitus, and previous
upper abdominal surgery all as significant risks, associated
with increased risk of conversion [175, 176]. However,
open cholecystectomy remains a feasible option, particu￾larly in low-income countries [177], or elsewhere in the
setting of resource limitations. The CIAOW study showed
that open cholecystectomy, among the patients with com￾plicated cholecystitis, was the most frequently performed
procedure [139].
In LMICs, laparoscopic surgery is just evolving in ter￾tiary centers. Despite the low volume of patients and the
absence of fluoroscopy in many hospitals results in treat￾ing acute cholecystitis seem to be comparable with high
volume centers [177].
Cholecystostomy is a safe and effective treatment for
acute cholecystitis in critically ill and/or with multiple co￾morbidities and unfit for surgery patients (Recommenda￾tion 1B).
Acute cholecystitis in elderly, critically ill patients still
today remains a real challenge to treat. Despite the low
rate of surgical impact from the laparoscopic approach,
many patients are unfit for any surgery. In this subgroup
of patients, urgent cholecystostomy with or without de￾layed laparoscopic cholecystectomy appears to be the
correct clinical approach [178–198].
Early diagnosis of gallbladder perforation and immedi￾ate surgical intervention may substantially decrease mor￾bidity and mortality rates (Recommendation 1C).
Gallbladder perforation is an unusual complication;
occasionally, acute cholecystitis, inflammation, and
fulminant infection may progress to ischemic necrosis
and gallbladder perforation. Prompt surgical interven￾tion is important in decreasing morbidity and mortal￾ity rates associated with this situation. The reported
incidence of gallbladder perforation in acute chole￾cystitis is 2–11% [190–200], and mortality in such
cases is as high as 12–16% [201–204].
The gallbladder perforation is classified into three types:
acute or type I-free perforation with generalized peritonitis,
subacute or type II-pericholecystic abscess with localized
peritonitis, and chronic or type III-cholecysto-enteric fistula
[205]. Perforation of the fundus is usually free perforation
leading to generalized peritonitis whereas perforation in the
region of body or neck becomes covered with omentum
leading to localized collection. Type I and II perforations
Sartelli et al. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017) 12:29 Page 13 of 34

are reported to occur in a younger age group (around
50 years) whereas type III perforations are commonly seen
in more elderly patients [200]. Type I perforations are
typically encountered in patients with severe systemic
disease (DM, atherosclerotic heart disease) without past
history of acute cholecystitis, while type III perforation
cases usually have previous history of recurrent attacks of
cholecystitis [202–205]. The diagnosis is difficult and often
delayed since the presentation is very much similar to acute
cholecystitis. The ultrasound findings in such cases are also
similar to the findings of acute cholecystitis, but
visualization of the sonographic “hole sign” in the gallblad￾der wall can hint at the diagnosis of perforated gallbladder
[206]. CT scan is more reliable in making the diagnosis as it
better demonstrates the defect in the gallbladder wall in
addition to pericholecystic collection and free intra￾peritoneal fluid [206, 207].
Perforation is rarely diagnosed pre-operatively. Delayed
surgical intervention is associated with elevated morbidity
and mortality rates, increased likelihood of ICU admission,
and prolonged post-operative hospitalization [208–210].
Acute cholangitis
Acute cholangitis is an infectious disease characterized
by acute inflammation and infection in the bile ducts
resulting from a combination of biliary obstruction and
bacterial growth in bile.
Bacteria reach the biliary system either by ascent
from the intestine or by the portal venous system
[211]. The most common cause of cholangitis is cho￾ledocholithiasis [212].
The key elements of therapy in acute cholangitis are
adequate antimicrobial treatment to avoid or manage the
septic complications and biliary decompression to restore
biliary drainage in case of obstruction [213]. The clinical
presentation varies, and initial risk stratification is import￾ant to guide further management [214].
In severe cholangitis, an early interventional approach
is absolutely essential for survival.
The type and timing of biliary drainage should be based
on the severity of the clinical presentation, and the
availability and feasibility of drainage techniques, such as
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP),
percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC), and
open surgical drainage.
ERCP plays a central role in the management of biliary
obstruction in patients with acute cholangitis.
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
(ERCP) is the treatment of choice for biliary decompres￾sion in patients with moderate/severe acute cholangitis
(Recommendation 1A).
A randomized controlled trial (RCT) [215] was con￾ducted to compare endoscopic and open drainage in 82
patients with severe acute cholangitis with hypotension
and disturbed consciousness. This RCT demonstrated
that the morbidity and mortality of endoscopic naso￾biliary drainage (ENBD) + endoscopic sphincterotomy
(EST; n = 41) were significantly lower than those of T￾tube drainage under laparotomy (n = 41). The authors
concluded that morbidity and mortality of endoscopic
naso-biliary drainage (ENBD) + endoscopic sphincterot￾omy are lower than those of T-tube drainage under
laparotomy.
There are various endoscopic transpapillary options
available, including biliary stent or nasobiliary drain place￾ment above the obstruction site ± sphincterotomy, all of
which with their appropriate indications corresponding to
disease severity and clinical context [216].
Endoscopic biliary decompression by nasobiliary cath￾eter or indwelling stent was equally effective for patients
with acute suppurative cholangitis caused by bile duct
stones in a prospective randomized trial published in 2002
[217]. The indwelling stent was associated with less post￾procedure discomfort and avoided the potential problem
of inadvertent removal of the nasobiliary catheter.
Percutaneous biliary drainage (PTBD) should be re￾served for patients in whom ERCP fails (Recommenda￾tion 1B).
There are patients in whom ERCP fails because of un￾successful biliary cannulation, or an inaccessible papilla.
In these cases, percutaneous biliary drainage (PTBD) is
required. However, PTBD can lead to significant compli￾cations, including biliary peritonitis, hemobilia, pneumo￾thorax, hematoma, liver abscesses, and patient
discomfort related to the catheter [218].
In 2012, a retrospective study comparing the safety and
effectiveness of endoscopic and percutaneous transhepatic
biliary drainage in the treatment of acute obstructive sup￾purative cholangitis was reported. It confirmed the clinical
efficacy of endoscopic drainage as well as its ability to facili￾tate subsequent endoscopic or surgical intervention [219].
Open drainage should only be used in patients for whom
endoscopic or percutaneous trans-hepatic drainage is
contraindicated or those in whom it has been unsuccess￾fully performed (Recommendation 2C).
The indication for emergent open operation for acute
cholangitis is rapidly disappearing. Emergency operation
for severe cholangitis carries high mortality rates.
Given the shortened length of hospitalization and the
rarity of serious complications such as intra-peritoneal
hemorrhage and biliary peritonitis, endoscopic drainage
is preferred to open drainage [218–220].
Post-operative peritonitis
Post-operative peritonitis (PP) is a life-threatening
hospital-acquired intra-abdominal infection with high
rates of mortality [221, 222]. The most common cause
of PP is an anastomotic leakage [223]. It is most
Sartelli et al. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017) 12:29 Page 14 of 34

frequent after rectal resection [224], but it may compli￾cate any gastrointestinal anastomosis. Treating patients
with post-operative peritonitis requires supportive ther￾apy of organ dysfunction, source control of infection,
and intensive antimicrobial therapy. The diagnosis of
post-operative peritonitis may be difficult because there
are no absolutely specific clinical signs and laboratory
tests to reject or confirm the diagnosis. The atypical
clinical presentation may be responsible for a delay in
diagnosis and re-intervention or reoperation.
On the basis of the clinical conditions, the size of the
abscess and the access to interventional radiology,
antibiotics and/or percutaneous drainage may be sug￾gested to treat post-operative localized intra-abdominal
abscesses when there are no signs of generalized periton￾itis (Recommendation 2C).
Antibiotics and drainage may be the optimal means of
treating post-operative localized intra-abdominal ab￾scesses when there are no signs of generalized periton￾itis. Several retrospective studies in the fields of surgery
and radiology have documented the effectiveness of per￾cutaneous drainage in the treatment of post-operative
localized intra-abdominal abscesses [225].
Prompt surgical source control should be performed fol￾lowing diagnosis of post-operative peritonitis. Ineffective
control of the septic source is associated with significantly
elevated mortality rates (Recommendation 1C).
Complete surgical source control should be performed
as soon as the patient has been maximally resuscitated.
The inability to control the septic source is associated
with an intolerably high patient mortality [222]. Organ
failure and/or subsequent re-laparotomies that have
been delayed for more than 24 h both result in higher
rates of mortality for patients affected by post-operative
intra-abdominal infections [226]. Early re-laparotomies
appear to be the most effective means of treating post￾operative peritonitis [227].
In 2009, a retrospective study by Chichom-Mefire et
al. [228] analyzed aspects of re-operative abdominal sur￾gery in an economically disadvantaged environment with
respect to indications, operative findings, treatment mo￾dalities, and outcomes. Mortality in this series was 18%,
increasingly significant when the initial operative pro￾cedure was for peritonitis and re-operation was due to
septic complications. Operative re-intervention based on
clinical findings was considered the favored strategy.
Pelvic inflammatory disease
Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of the
upper part of the female reproductive genital tract,
including the uterus, fallopian tubes, and adjacent pelvic
structures and may spread to the abdomen causing periton￾itis [229], caused by bacterial infection spreading from the
vagina and cervix. Occasionally, right-upper quadrant pain
suggestive of inflammation and adhesion formation in the
liver capsule (Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome) can accompany
pelvic inflammatory disease.
The sexually transmitted Neisseria gonorrhoeae and
Chlamydia trachomatis are present in many cases; how￾ever, microorganisms including the endogenous vaginal
and cervical flora may also cause PID. Genital tract
mycoplasmas, most importantly Mycoplasma genitalium,
have recently also been implicated as a cause of acute
PID [230]. The global epidemiologic profile of pelvic in￾flammatory disease has not been well defined. Due to fi￾nancial and logistic reasons, pelvic inflammatory disease
prevention programs that are based on screening are
simply unavailable in most countries, where the burden
of pelvic inflammatory disease may be the greatest [231].
Patients with tubo-ovarian abscess that does not re￾spond to antibiotics should undergo surgical drainage
(Recommendation 1C).
Tubo-ovarian abscesses (TOA) may be a complication
of PID. In women of reproductive age, TOA is one of
the most common types of pelvic abscess. TOA are clas￾sically treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. However,
if antibiotic therapy is not sufficient, surgical drainage
should be performed [232–235].
Post-traumatic gastrointestinal perforations
Trauma continues to be a global major public health prob￾lem worldwide, and it is associated with high morbidity and
mortality worldwide regardless of the socioeconomic status
[236]. Both blunt and penetrating forces may result in
bowel injury; motor vehicle crashes remain the most
common, and falls the next most common, cause of blunt
force trauma globally [237].
Hollow visceral injury (HVI) has a more insidious
presentation in this setting, often resulting in delayed
diagnoses. Clinical signs may take time to develop,
and imaging investigations are not completely sensi￾tive. In addition, other injuries may distract the
patient and clinical team, and accurate and timely
diagnosis is often difficult. An improved outcome is
reported in these settings, where, as a result of
advances in imaging modalities, patient monitoring
devices and prompt intervention is possible, while
poor diagnostic facilities, late presentation, as well as
late intervention adversely may affect the outcome in
other settings [238, 239].
Several mechanisms of bowel injury have been doc￾umented in the wake of blunt abdominal trauma. The
most common injury is the posterior crushing of the
bowel segment between the seat belt and vertebra or
pelvis. It can result in local lacerations of the bowel
wall, mural and mesenteric hematomas, transection of
the bowel, localized devascularization, and full￾thickness contusions. Devitalization of the areas of
Sartelli et al. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017) 12:29 Page 15 of 34

contusion may subsequently result in late perforation.
Colonic injuries occurred less frequently than small
intestinal injuries perhaps due to its location and the
lack of redundancy, which prevents the formation of
closed loops. Abdominal trauma may be associated
with other additional co-morbid injuries, which could
complicate the management and affect the outcome.
Delay in diagnosis and treatment of the HVI may re￾sult in early peritonitis, hemodynamic instability and
increased mortality and morbidity.
Early surgical intervention is recommended in case of
HVI (Recommendation 1C).
Repair or anastomosis of intestinal injuries should be
considered in all patients. A complete diversion of the
faecal stream could be considered in colorectal injuries
involving all layers in the setting of multiple injuries or
comorbid conditions (Recommendation 1C).
Early clinical recognition and surgical intervention
is importance in case of HVI [239–241]. The accuracy
of clinical examination signs in this setting remain
poor. Signs include ecchymosis of the abdominal wall,
increasing abdominal pain and distension are all
associated with HVI [239]. A range of investigative
modalities is available, including imaging techniques
(plain x-ray, ultrasound, CT), and diagnostic periton￾eal aspirate/lavage. However, in the presence of
clinical peritonitis, surgical exploration is mandatory.
Repair or anastomosis of intestinal injuries should be
considered in all patients. A complete diversion of
the fecal stream should be considered in colorectal
injuries involving all layers in the setting of multiple
injuries and resultant physiological compromise,
unfavorable comorbid conditions, and perhaps in the
setting of delayed diagnoses [239].
Damage control laparotomy (DCL) in the context of
HVI is accepted for small bowel injury in the context of
coagulopathy, while colon ligation has been debated
because of high complication rates and an increased in￾cidence of leakage; however, delayed anastomosis of
colon injuries after DCL may avoid stoma creation in
some patients who are not candidates for anastomosis
during initial intervention [242].
Re-laparotomy strategy
Severe infection may be associated with marked inflam￾matory responses, which in the extreme circumstance
may result in an excessive, dysfunctional immune
response, with resultant physiological collapse. These
shocked patients develop organ dysfunction and
progress to a multiple organ dysfunction syndrome
(MODS). In this case, a staged operative approach may
minimize further physiological insults associated with a
time and energy intense primary definitive operative
strategy [243].
Apart from a staged operative approach, the clinical team
may also employ a planned re-laparotomy approach to re￾examine pathology and facilitate repeated debridement of
contaminated tissues. However, deciding if and when to
perform a re-laparotomy in cases of secondary peritonitis
remains difficult. Factors indicative of progressive or per￾sistent organ failure during early post-operative follow-up
analysis are the best indicators of ongoing infection [52].
Three relaparotomy strategies are currently employed for
management of abdominal sepsis following an initial lapar￾otomy: (a) open abdomen, (b) planned re-laparotomy, and
(c) on-demand re-laparotomy.
The on-demand re-laparotomy is recommended for
patients with severe peritonitis because its ability to
streamline healthcare resources, reduce overall medical
costs, and prevent the need for further re-laparotomies
(Recommendation 2A).
In 2007, van Ruler et al. published a randomized, clinical
study comparing planned and on-demand re-laparotomy
strategies for patients with severe peritonitis [243].
Patients in the on-demand relaparotomy group did not
have a significantly lower rate of death or major
peritonitis-related morbidity compared with the planned
relaparotomy group, but did have a substantial reduction
in relaparotomies, healthcare utilization, and medical
costs. More recently, a study conducted over a 30-month
period in South Africa analyzed prospectively gathered
data entered into an established electronic registry com￾paring patients requiring planned laparotomy (PR) with
patients requiring on-demand laparotomy [244]. A total of
162 patients were included, with an average age of 36 years
(standard deviation 17) and 69% male predominance.
Patients selected for the PR strategy had higher admission
pulse rates, higher Modified Early Warning System
(MEWS) scores and significantly higher rates of diffuse
intra-abdominal sepsis at initial laparotomy.
The open abdomen may be a viable option for treating
physiologically deranged patients with ongoing sepsis,
facilitating subsequent exploration and control of
abdominal contents, and preventing abdominal compart￾ment syndrome (Recommendation 1C).
In order to define the role of OA with negative pressure
therapy for improved biomediator clearance and miti￾gated systemic sepsis in patients with severe peritonitis a
prospective trial is needed.
The OA concept is closely linked to damage control
surgery. In patients with ongoing sepsis, an OA
approach may be required for controlling any persist￾ent source of infection and preventing abdominal
compartment syndrome.
OA facilitates repeated abdominal exploration in the
patients with severe peritonitis allowing easy second-look
to control the source of infection and evacuate inflamed
and toxic content, reducing the load of peritoneal
Sartelli et al. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017) 12:29 Page 16 of 34

cytokines and other inflammatory substances and prevent￾ing their production by removing the source itself [245].
Temporary closure of the abdomen may be achieved by
using gauze and large, impermeable, self-adhesive mem￾brane dressings, both absorbable and non-absorbable
meshes, and negative pressure therapy devices. The first
and easiest method to perform a laparostomy was the ap￾plication of a plastic silo (the “Bogota bag”). This system is
inexpensive. However, it does not provide sufficient traction
to the wound edges and allows the fascial edges to retract
laterally, resulting in difficult fascial closure under signifi￾cant tension, especially if the closure is delayed [243–247].
At present, negative pressure techniques (NPT) have
become the most extensively employed means of tem￾porary closure of the abdominal wall.
In 1986, Schein [246] et al. described a management
technique of the open abdominal wound. It consisted
of a “sandwich” composed of a Marlex mesh and an
Op-Site wound dressing with interposition of suction
tubes. Brock et al. in 1995 [248] described the place￾ment of a fenestrated polyethylene sheet between the
abdominal viscera and parietal peritoneum, followed
by a moist towel, Kerlix gauze bandage rolls with
closed suction drains or a sponge covered with an
occlusive adhesive drape [245]. This method defined
as the “Vacuum Pack Technique” is inexpensive, easily
applied and changed, protects the viscera, prevents
adhesions, removes exudate, and prevents some loss
of domain [247]. Commercially prepared negative
pressure dressings are available, and the initial dress￾ing may be changed to commercial dressing, if early
closure is impossible.
Rapid closure with the assistance of negative pressure
therapy should be the primary objective in the manage￾ment of patients with open abdomen, in order to prevent
severe morbidity such as fistulae, loss of domain and
massive incisional hernias (Recommendation 1B).
Severe complications including loss of the abdominal
domain, fistula formation, and the development of giant
incisional hernias may be observed in this procedure.
Following re-exploration, the goal should be the early and
definitive closure of the abdomen, in order to reduce the
complications associated with an open abdomen. Early de￾finitive closure (within 4–7 days of the initial laparostomy)
is the basis of preventing or reducing the risk of complica￾tions [248–250].
A systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate
whether early fascial abdominal closure had advantages
over delayed approach was published in 2014 [251]. The
study confirmed the clinical advantages of early fascial
closure compared with delayed closure in treatment of
patients with open abdomen.
If unable to close the abdomen early, a progressive
closure device may be necessary.
A systematic review and meta-analysis of the open
abdomen and temporary abdominal closure techniques
in non-trauma patients was recently published [252].
The best results in terms of achieving delayed fascial
closure and reducing the risk of entero-atmospheric
fistula were shown for NPT with continuous fascial trac￾tion. Despite that the authors concluded that the overall
quality of the available evidence was poor, and uniform
recommendations cannot be made.
Antimicrobial therapy
Judicious use of antimicrobials is an integral part of
good clinical practice. This attitude affects therapeutic
efficacy of treatment and minimizes the risks associated
with the selection of resistant pathogens.
Antimicrobial resistance poses a global challenge. No
single country can protect itself from the importation of
resistant pathogens through travel and trade.
The global nature of antimicrobial resistance calls for
a global response, both in the geographic sense and
across the whole range of sectors involved. Nobody is
exempt from the problem [253].
Although most surgeons are aware of the problem of
antimicrobial resistance, most underestimate this prob￾lem in their own hospital. The necessity of formalized
systematic approaches to the optimization of antibiotic
therapy for patients with intra-abdominal infections in
the setting of surgical units worldwide has become in￾creasingly urgent.
Knowledge of regional/local rates of resistance, when it
is available, should be always an essential component of
the clinical decision-making process when deciding the
empirical treatment of infection (Recommendation 1C).
Regional epidemiological data and resistance profiles
are essential for selecting appropriate antibiotic therapy
for IAIs [254, 255].
However, while high-income countries (HICs) have ex￾tensive surveillance systems to monitor antimicrobial resist￾ance [255], in low- and middle-income countries LMIC
surveillance systems have not really been established.
The Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance
Trends (SMART) provides the best available evidence
for the current status of cIAIs worldwide. The
SMART has monitored the in vitro susceptibility pat￾terns of clinical gram-negative bacilli to antimicrobial
agents collected worldwide from intra-abdominal in￾fections since 2002 [256, 257]. Isolates worldwide
showed the highest levels of antimicrobial resistance
of the global regions included the SMART study, and
a trend of increasing resistance continues year by
year. One particular cause for concern is the preva￾lence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-pro￾ducing Enterobacteriaceae in the clinical setting. The
prevalence of ESBLs intra-abdominal infections has
Sartelli et al. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017) 12:29 Page 17 of 34

steadily increased over time for in Asia. Europe, Latin
America, Middle East, North America, and South Pa￾cific [256, 257].
In addition to the expected increased resistance to
beta-lactams, fluoroquinolone resistance in ESBL-positive
Escherichia coli causing intra-abdominal infections ranges
from 60 to 93% in India, China, North America, Europe,
and South Africa [256, 257]. Although carbapenem activ￾ity against isolates from IAIs is also high, it is slightly
lower than activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates
from urinary tract infections.
Predicting the pathogens and potential resistance pat￾terns of a given infection begins by establishing whether the
infection is community-acquired or healthcare-associated.
For patients with community-acquired intra￾abdominal infections (CA-IAIs), agents with a narrower
spectrum of activity are preferred. However, in CA-IAI
patients at risk for extended-spectrum beta-lactamases
(ESBLs) producing Enterobacteriaceae infections, anti￾ESBL-producer coverage may be warranted. For patients
with healthcare-associated infections (HA-IAIs), anti￾biotic regimens with broader spectra of activity are pre￾ferred (Recommendation 1B).
Initial antibiotic therapy for IAIs is typically empirical in
nature because a patient with abdominal sepsis needs im￾mediate treatment, and microbiological data (culture and
susceptibility results) can require up to 48–72 h before they
are available for a more detailed analysis. Selection of
appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy is critical for pre￾venting unnecessary morbidity and mortality from cIAIs.
The major pathogens involved in community-acquired
intra-abdominal infections are usual residents of gastro￾intestinal flora, including Enterobacteriaceae, streptococci,
and certain anaerobes (particularly Bacteroides fragilis)
[75]. Narrower spectrum antimicrobial agents are appropri￾ate for these patients [258].
In the context of intra-abdominal infections, the main
resistance problem is posed by ESBL-producing Entero￾bacteriaceae, which are prevalent in hospital-acquired
infections but observed in CA-IAIs too [139].
Specific risk factors for ESBL-producing bacteria in
community-acquired infections include recent exposure to
antibiotics (particularly third generation cephalosporins or
fluoroquinolones) within 90 days of IAI or known
colonization with ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae [253].
Although increasing overtime everywhere, carriage of
ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae did not evolve with
the same dynamics and large intra- and inter-regional
variations have been observed. Poor access to drinking
water, water pollution, and a high population density are ef￾ficient drivers for ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae dis￾semination, as for any fecally-orally transmitted diseases
[259]. Reports from the Western Pacific, Eastern Mediterra￾nean, and Southeast Asia regions showed the highest
carriage rates and the most striking recent ascending trends
[259], explaining why travelers into these areas of the world
are at risk of becoming colonized [260]. In contrast, rates re￾ported in Europe never exceeded 10% [259].
HA IAIs include hospital-acquired infections (develop￾ing greater than 48 h after initial source control) but also
infections in patients having recent hospitalization
within 90 days, living in a skilled nursing or other long￾term care facility, using aggressive medical therapies
(intravenous therapy, wound dressing) at home and in￾vasive therapies (haemodialysis, chemotherapy, radio￾therapy) in outpatient clinics within 30 days of the index
infection. HA-IAIs are commonly caused by more re￾sistant flora. Here, complex multidrug regimens may be
necessary for first line, empiric therapy. Although trans￾mission of multidrug resistant organisms is most fre￾quently documented in acute care facilities, all
healthcare settings are affected by the emergence and
transmission of antimicrobial-resistant microbes [253].
Resistant flora may include the non-fermenting gram￾negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa, very dangerous either
in the abdominal cavity, [261] or in hepatobiliary surgery
[262–265] and Acinetobacter spp, ESBL-producing K.
pneumonia, E. coli and vancomycin-resistant enterococci
(VRE) [266, 267].
During the last two decades, antimicrobial resistance has
become a global threat to public health systems and some of
the most common causes include erroneous use of antibi￾otics, and poor prevention and control with respect to infec￾tions. Particularly, infections caused by resistant gram￾negative bacteria [253, 268] are becoming increasingly
prevalent and now constitute a serious threat to public
health worldwide because they are difficult to treat and are
associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Bacteria
producing carbapenemases, such as K. pneumonia, are rap￾idly emerging as a major source of multidrug-resistant infec￾tions worldwide [269–272] and pose a serious threat in
clinical situations where administration of effective empiric
antibiotics is essential to prevent mortality following bacter￾aemia and infections in immunocompromised patients.
Non-fermenting gram-negative bacteria (P. aeruginosa, Ste￾notrophomonas maltophilia, and Acinetobacter baumannii)
have exhibited alarming rates of increased resistance to a
variety of antibiotics in health facilities worldwide. Both spe￾cies are intrinsically resistant to several drugs and could
acquire additional resistance to other important antimicro￾bial agents [253]. P. aeruginosa coverage is only generally
recommended for patients with HA-IAIs.
Among gram-positive bacteria, enterococci play a sig￾nificant role in IAI. Some studies have demonstrated poor
outcomes among patients with documented entero￾coccal infections, particularly in those with post￾operative IAI where enterococci coverage should be
always considered [273, 274].
Sartelli et al. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017) 12:29 Page 18 of 34

The acquisition of glycopeptide resistance by en￾terococci has seriously affected the treatment and
control of these organisms. Affected patients usually
have multiple and relevant co-morbidities, with pro￾longed hospital stay and received long courses of
broad-spectrum antibiotics [274].
The burden of multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO)
infections in LMICs is difficult to quantify because in
these countries, routine microbiologic culture and
sensitivity testing, especially in rural hospitals, are not
performed because of the lack of personnel, equip￾ment, and financial resources. As a consequence, anti￾microbial therapy is empirical and a small collection
of antimicrobials may be overused. This approach,
although relatively inexpensive, may increase the
emergence of antimicrobial resistance and hence sub￾optimal clinical outcomes [253].
Therefore, although resistance containment inter￾ventions in healthcare structures have mostly been
implemented in high-income countries, there is a
pressing need to intervene in the resistance pandemic
also in LMIC.
In the setting of HA-IAIs, post-operative peritonitis (PP)
is a life-threatening hospital-acquired intra-abdominal in￾fection with high rates of mortality and high risk for MDR
infections and invasive candidiasis [275, 276]. Antimicrobial
therapy between initial intervention and reoperation seems
to be a significant risk factor for emergence of MDRO in
patients with PP. A study by Augustin et al. [276] included
all consecutive adult patients with a diagnosis of post￾operative peritonitis requiring admission to a surgical inten￾sive care unit from January 2001 to December 2004. A total
of 269 bacteria were cultured in 100 patients including 41
episodes with MDRO. According to logistic regression
analysis, the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics between the
initial intervention and reoperation was a significant risk
factor for emergence of MDRO.
In 2015, a retrospective review of patients with anasto￾motic leakage after colorectal cancer surgery [277], re￾ported the use of antibiotics for more than 5 days before
diagnosis of anastomosis site leakage, and diabetes melli￾tus were identified as independent risk factors for MDRO
acquisition by multivariate analysis.
In critically ill patients antimicrobial therapy should
be started as soon as possible.
In these patients to ensure timely and effective admin￾istration of antibiotics, clinicians should always consider
the pathophysiological status of the patient as well as the
pharmacokinetic properties of the employed antibiotics
(Recommendation 1B).
An ineffective or otherwise inadequate antimicro￾bial regimen is one of the variables more strongly
associated with unfavorable outcomes in critical ill
patients [278].
Empiric antimicrobial therapy should be started as
soon as possible in patients with organ dysfunction and
septic shock [279].
However, apart from early timing of administration,
selection of a pharmacological agent with penetration
to the site of presumed infection, is necessary.
Furthermore, the pathophysiological and immuno￾logical status of the patient and the pharmacokinetic
properties of the chosen drugs warrant consideration.
In the event of abdominal sepsis, clinicians must be
aware that drug pharmacokinetics may be altered
significantly in critically ill patients due to the patho￾physiology of sepsis. For example, in critically ill patients,
higher than standard loading doses of hydrophilic antimi￾crobials such as beta-lactams should be administered to
ensure optimal exposure at the infection site independ￾ently of the patient’s renal function because of the dilution
effect [280].
Two patterns of bactericidal activity have been de￾scribed for antibiotics: time-dependent activity (where
the time that the plasma concentration persists above
the MIC of the etiological agent is considered the
major determinant for efficacy) and concentration￾dependent activity (where the efficacy is mainly
related to the plasma peak concentration in relation
to the MIC of the microorganism). The efficacy of
time-dependent antibacterial agents in severely ill
patients is related primarily to the maintenance of
supra-inhibitory concentrations, and therefore, mul￾tiple daily dosing or continuous infusion may be
appropriate [280, 281].
On the other hand, some agents including aminogly￾cosides have concentration-dependent activity; therefore,
for this antibiotic class, the entire daily dose should be
administered in a once daily way (or with the lowest
possible number of daily administrations) to achieve the
highest peak plasma level and reduce the renal cortex
exposure to aminoglycosides and reduces the risk of
nephrotoxicity [282].
In patients with uncomplicated IAI such as uncompli￾cated appendicitis and uncomplicated cholecystitis, where
the source of infection is treated definitively, post-operative
antibiotic therapy is not necessary (Recommendation 1A).
In patients with complicated IAI undergoing an ad￾equate source-control procedure, a short course of anti￾biotic therapy (3-5 d) is always recommended
(Recommendation 1A).
Patients who have ongoing signs of peritonitis or sys￾temic illness (ongoing infection) beyond 5 to 7 days of
antibiotic treatment, should warrant a diagnostic investi￾gation (Recommendation 1C).
Antibiotics should be used after a treatable infection has
been recognized or if there is a high degree of suspicion of
an infection. In the setting of uncomplicated acute IAIs
Sartelli et al. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017) 12:29 Page 19 of 34

such as uncomplicated appendicitis or cholecystitis, single
doses have the same impact as multiple doses and post
operative antimicrobial therapy is not necessary if source
control is adequate [170, 283–285].
In the setting of cIAIs, a short course of antibiotic ther￾apy (3–5 days) after adequate source control is a reason￾able option [170, 283–285]. The recent prospective trial
by Sawyer et al. demonstrated that in patients with cIAI
undergoing an adequate source control, the outcomes
after approximately 4 days fixed-duration antibiotic
therapy were similar to those after a longer course of anti￾biotics that extended until after the resolution of physio￾logical abnormalities [286]. However, in critically ill
patients with ongoing sepsis, an individualized approach
should be always mandatory and patient’s inflammatory
response should be monitored regularly [287] and deci￾sions to continue, narrow, or stop antimicrobial therapy
must be made on the basis of clinician judgment.
Patients who have ongoing signs of peritonitis or
systemic illness beyond 5–7 days of antibiotic treatment
normally warrant a diagnostic investigation to determine
whether additional surgical intervention is necessary to
address an ongoing uncontrolled source of infection or
antimicrobial treatment failure. The prolonged and
inappropriate use of antibiotics appears a key factor in the
rapid rise of antimicrobial resistance worldwide over the
past decade [287]. A rational and appropriate use of anti￾biotics is particularly important both to optimize quality
clinical care and to reduce selection pressure on resistant
pathogens. Several strategies aiming at achieving optimal
use of antimicrobial agents have been described, but it is
important that surgeons know antibiotic administration
minimal requirements. Without these minimal require￾ments, surgeons worldwide will increase the likelihood of
treatment failures and antibiotic resistance.
The choice of empiric antibiotic regimens in patients with
IAI should be based on the clinical condition of the patients,
the individual risk for infection by resistant pathogens, and
the local resistance epidemiology (Recommendation 1C).
Intra-abdominal infections may be managed with ei￾ther single or multiple antibiotic regimens.
Beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations have
an in vitro activity against gram-positive, gram-negative,
and anaerobe organisms. Amoxicillin/clavulanate is still an
option in mild community acquired IAIs. Broad-spectrum
activity of piperacillin/tazobactam, including anti-P. seudo￾monas effect and anaerobic coverage, still make it an inter￾esting option for management of severe IAIs. However, the
use of piperacillin/tazobactam in patients with ESBLs infec￾tions is still controversial [288, 289], even if in stable pa￾tients, it may be still a therapeutic chance.
Third generation cephalosporins including cefotaxime
and ceftriaxone in association with metronidazole, may
be still options for the treatment of mild IAIs.
Ceftazidime and cefoperazone are third generation ceph￾alosporins with an activity against P. aeruginosa. Cefe￾pime, is a fourth-generation cephalosporin, with broader
spectrum activity than third generation cephalosprins
and effective against AmpC-producing organisms [290].
For empiric therapy, also cefepime should also be com￾bined with metronidazole because it does not possess
anti-anaerobic activity [291].
Ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are no longer appropri￾ate choice as first-line treatment in many geographic
regions because of the prevalence of fluoroquinolone
resistance. However, when employed, these drugs should
be used in association with metronidazole. In many
current practices, the fluoroquinolones remain available
for patients presenting allergy to beta-lactams, with mild
intra-abdominal infections [75].
Carbapenems offer a wide spectrum of antimicrobial ac￾tivity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and
anaerobic pathogens (with the exception of MDR-resistant
gram-positive cocci). Group 1 carbapenems include
ertapenem. This group has activity against extended￾spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing pathogens,
but not active against P. aeruginosa and Enterococcus
species. Group 2 includes imipenem/cilastatin, merope￾nem, and doripenem, which share activity against non￾fermentative gram-negative bacilli [75].
For more than two decades, carbapenems have been
considered the agents of choice for multidrug-resistant
infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae. The recent and
rapid spread K. pneumoniae carbapenems resistant has
become a critical issue in hospitals worldwide. The use
of carbapenems should be limited so as to preserve ac￾tivity of this class of antibiotics because of the concern
of emerging carbapenem-resistance [253].
Other options include aminoglycosides, particularly
for suspected infections by gram-negative bacteria.
They are effective against P. aeruginosa, but are inef￾fective against anaerobic bacteria and need association
with metronidazole. Because of their toxic side effects,
some guidelines did not recommend aminoglycosides
for the routine empiric treatment of community￾acquired IAI, reserving them for patients with aller￾gies to beta-lactam agents or in combination with
beta-lactams for treatment of IAI with suspected
MDR gram-negative bacteria [292].
Tigecycline is a viable treatment option, especially in em￾piric therapy, for complicated IAIs due to its favorable in
vitro activity against anaerobic organisms, enterococci, sev￾eral ESBL- and in association carbapenemase-producing
Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter species, and Stenotropho￾monas maltophilia [293–295]. It does not feature in vitro
activity against P. aeruginosa or P. mirabilis. Caution is al￾ways advised for its use, in suspected bacteremia and
healthcare-associated pneumonia [296].
Sartelli et al. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017) 12:29 Page 20 of 34

The recent challenges of treating multidrug-resistant
gram-negative infections, especially in critically ill patients,
have renewed interest in the use of “old” antibiotics such as
polymyxins and fosfomycin [297, 298], now routinely used
for treatment of MDR bacteria in critical ill patients.
Ceftolozone/tazobactam and ceftazidime/avibactam are
new antibiotics that have been approved for treatment of
cIAIs (in combination with metronidazole) including in￾fection by ESBLs producing Enterobacteriaceae and P.
aeruginosa. These antimicrobials will be valuable for treat￾ing infections caused by MDR gram-negative bacteria in
order to preserve carbapenems [299]. Ceftolozone/tazo￾bactam has excellent in vitro activity against MDR P. aer￾uginosa [299]. Ceftazidime/avibactam seems to have an in
vitro activity against K. pneumoniae carbapenemase￾producing bacteria [300]. Although many reviews have
been written, their precise role as empiric treatment for
complicated IAI remains to be defined [301].
In table 4, antibiotics for treating patients with cIAIs
as proposed by the AGORA working group are illus￾trated [253]. Appendices 1, 2, 3, 4 list antimicrobial regi￾mens for management of patients with cIAIs in different
settings worldwide.
Intra-operative cultures should be always performed in
patients with HA-IAs or with CA- at risk for resistant
pathogens or in critically ill patients. They allow expan￾sion of the antimicrobial regimen if the initial choice is
too narrow and to perform a de-escalation if the empir￾ical regimen is too broad.
When a microorganism is identified in clinical cultures,
antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) should always
be performed and reported to guide antibiotic therapy
(Recommendation 1C).
Although a lack of impact on patient outcomes by bac￾teriological cultures has been documented in patients
with community-acquired IAI, especially in appendicitis
[302, 303], the results of microbiological testing may
have great importance for the choice of therapeutic
strategy of every patient, in particular, in the adaptation
of targeted antimicrobial treatment in patients at risk of
unpredictable organisms.
Obtaining microbiological results from intra-operative
culture from the site of infection has two advantages: (a)
to expand antimicrobial regimen if the initial choice was
too narrow and (b) to perform de-escalation of antimicro￾bial therapy if the empirical regimen was too broad [253].
When a microorganism is identified in clinical cultures,
antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) should always be
performed to guide antimicrobial therapy. Data are
reported in the form of MIC, which is the lowest concen￾tration of an antibiotic that inhibits visible growth of a
microorganism.
The numerical MIC number, expressed as micrograms/
ml, is usually reported by microbiology laboratories as a
categorical guide for clinicians, i.e., as “susceptible”, “resist￾ant”, or “intermediate,” according to Clinical or Laboratory
Standards Institute (CLSI) criteria in the USA or the
European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility
Testing (EUCAST) criteria in Europe.
Knowledge of mechanisms of secretion of antibiotics into
bile may be helpful in designing the optimal therapeutic
regimen for patients with biliary-related intra-abdominal
infections (Recommendation 1C).
Organisms most often isolated in biliary infections are
those isolated in intra-abdominal infections including the
gram-negative aerobes, E. coli and K. pneumonia and an￾aerobes, especially B. fragilis [153]. The role of enterococci
in biliary tract infections remains unclear, and specific
coverage against these microorganisms is not routinely
suggested for community-acquired biliary infections [153].
Although there are no clinical data to support the use of
antibiotics with biliary penetration for these patients, the
efficacy of antibiotics in the treatment of biliary infections
may depend on effective biliary antibiotic concentrations
too [153]. Obviously in patients with obstructed bile ducts,
the biliary penetration of antibiotics may be poor and ef￾fective biliary concentrations are reached only in a minor￾ity of patients [153].
Antibiotics commonly used to treat biliary tract infec￾tions and their biliary penetration ability are illustrated
in Table 5.
Empirical antifungal therapy for Candida species is rec￾ommended for patients with hospital-acquired IAIs, espe￾cially those with recent abdominal surgery or anastomotic
leak (Recommendation 1C).
The epidemiological profile of Candida spp in the con￾text of nosocomial peritonitis is incompletely defined. Its
clinical presence is usually associated with poor prognosis.
Empirical antifungal therapy for Candida spp is typically
not recommended for patients with community-acquired
intra-abdominal infections, with the notable exceptions of
critically ill patients or immunocompromised patients
(due to neutropenia or concurrent administration of im￾munosuppressive agents, such as glucocorticosteroids,
chemotherapeutic agents, and immunomodulators) [304].
Recently, IDSA guidelines for the treatment of invasive
candidiasis were developed and addressed Candida
peritonitis [275]. IDSA guidelines suggested considering
empiric antifungal therapy for patients with clinical
evidence of intra-abdominal infection and significant risk
factors for candidiasis, including recent abdominal sur￾gery, anastomotic leaks, or necrotizing pancreatitis, who
are doing poorly despite treatment for bacterial infections.
Preferred empiric therapy in critically ill patients or
those previously exposed to an azole is an echinocandin
(Caspofungin: loading dose of 70 mg, then 50 mg daily;
Micafungin:100 mg daily; Anidulafungin: loading dose of
200 mg, then 100 mg daily). However, fluconazole,
Sartelli et al. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017) 12:29 Page 21 of 34

600 mg (12 mg/kg) loading dose, then 400 mg (6 mg/kg)
daily, should be still considered first-line antifungal ther￾apy, in hemodynamically stable patients who are colonized
with azole susceptible Candida species or who have no
prior exposure to azoles [275].
Conclusions
IAIs remain an important cause of morbidity and mortality
in modern surgical practice worldwide. The cornerstones of
effective treatment of IAIs include early and accurate diag￾nosis, prompt resuscitation, early and effective source

control, and initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy.
IAIs have different disease and clinical spectra in the vari￾ous regions of the world, and their etiological factors show
a wide geographical variation. Promoting standards of care
in the managing IAIs worldwide should be mandatory to
grant management guidelines to all surgeons.

Appendix 5
WSES recommendations for management of intra￾abdominal infections
Principles of sepsis control
Statement 1
Early recognition of the patient with ongoing abdominal
sepsis is an essential step for an effective treatment.
Prompt administration of intravenous fluids for
resuscitation is critical in patients with an ongoing
sepsis. This initial resuscitation should be titrated to the
clinical response, and not solely guided by a predetermined
protocol. Vasopressor agents may serve to augment and
assist fluid resuscitation, particularly where this therapy
alone is failing (Recommendation 1A).
Diagnosis
Statement 2
A step-up approach for diagnosis from clinical and
laboratory examination, to imaging examination
should be used and tailored to the hospitals resources
(Recommendation 1B).
Source control
Statement 3
Appendectomy remains the treatment of choice also for
acute appendicitis. Antibiotic therapy is a safe means of
primary treatment for patients with uncomplicated acute
appendicitis, but it is less effective in the long-term due
to significant recurrence rates and probably needs the
certainty of a CT proven diagnosis of uncomplicated
appendicitis (Recommendation 1A).
Statement 4
Both open and laparoscopic appendectomies are viable
approaches to surgical treatment of acute appendicitis
(Recommendation 1A).
Statement 5
Patients with a periappendiceal abscess can be managed
with percutaneous image-guided drainage in surgical
departments with ready access to diagnostic and
interventional radiology. When percutaneous drainage is
not available, surgery is suggested (Recommendation 1B).
Statement 6
In patients treated conservatively, interval appendectomy
may be not necessary following initial non-operative
treatment of complicated appendicitis. However, interval
appendectomies should always be performed for patients
with recurrent symptoms (Recommendation 2B).
Statement 7
Routine use of intra-operative irrigation for appendectomies
does not prevent intra-abdominal abscess formation and
may be avoided (Recommendation 2B).
Statement 8
Antibiotics can be avoided in patients with CT findings of
uncomplicated ALCD and without significant comorbid
conditions or signs of sepsis. Patients should be clinically
monitored to assess for resolution of the inflammatory
processes (Recommendation 1A).
Sartelli et al. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017) 12:29 Page 24 of 34

Statement 9
On the basis of clinical conditions, patients with diverticular
smaller abscesses may be treated by antibiotics alone
(Recommendation 1C).
Statement 10
Patients with abscesses having a large diameter should
be treated by percutaneous drainage and intravenous
antibiotics (Recommendation 1C).
Statement 11
Whenever percutaneous drainage of the abscess is not
feasible or not available, based on the clinical conditions
patients with large abscesses can be initially treated by
antibiotic therapy alone. However, careful clinical
monitoring is mandatory (Recommendation 1C).
Statement 12
Hartmann’s procedure remains useful in the management
of diffuse peritonitis in critically ill patients. However, in
clinically stable patients, primary resection with
anastomosis, with or without a diverting stoma, may be
performed (Recommendation 1B).
Statement 13
Laparoscopic peritoneal lavage and drainage may not be
considered the treatment of choice in patients with
diffuse peritonitis (Recommendation 1A).
Statement 14
Treatments for perforated colonic carcinoma should
both stabilize the emergency condition of the peritonitis
and fulfil the technical objectives of oncological
intervention (Recommendation 1B).
Statement 15
Patients presenting with diffuse peritonitis caused by
colonoscopic perforation should undergo immediate
surgical intervention, which typically involves primary
repair or resection (Recommendation 1B).
Statement 16
An early laparoscopic approach may be a safe and effective
option for colonoscopy-related colonic perforation for
experienced surgeons (Recommendation 2B).
Statement 17
Surgery is the treatment of choice for perforated peptic
ulcers (Recommendation 1A).
Statement 18
Simple closure with or without an omental patch is a
safe and effective procedure to address small perforated
ulcers (<2 cm) (Recommendation 1A).
Statement 19
Laparoscopic repair of perforated peptic ulcers can be a
safe and effective procedure for experienced surgeons
(Recommendation 1A).
Statement 20
Surgery is the treatment of choice for patients with small
bowel perforations (Recommendation 1B).
Statement 21
In the event of small perforations, primary repair is
recommended (Recommendation 1B).
Statement 22
In the case of abdominal tuberculosis perforation,
resection of the affected area and anastomosis may be
the treatment of choice rather than primary closure
(Recommendation 1C).
Statement 23
Early cholecystectomy is a safe treatment for acute
cholecystitis and generally results in shorter recovery
time and hospitalization compared to delayed
cholecystectomies (Recommendation 1A).
Statement 24
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a safe and effective
treatment for acute cholecystitis (Recommendation 1A).
It is the first choice for patients with acute cholecystitis
where adequate resources and skill are available. Some
risk factors may predict the risk for conversion to open
cholecystectomy.
Statement 25
Cholecystostomy is a safe and effective treatment for
acute cholecystitis in critically ill and/or with
multiple comorbidities and unfit for surgery patients
(Recommendation 1B).
Statement 26
Early diagnosis of gallbladder perforation and immediate
surgical intervention may substantially decrease morbidity
and mortality rates (Recommendation 1C).
Statement 27
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
is the treatment of choice for biliary decompression
in patients with moderate/severe acute cholangitis
(Recommendation 1A).
Statement 28
Percutaneous biliary drainage (PTBD) should be reserved
for patients in whom ERCP fails (Recommendation 1B).
Sartelli et al. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017) 12:29 Page 25 of 34

Statement 29
Open drainage should only be used in patients for whom
endoscopic or percutaneous trans-hepatic drainage is
contraindicated or those in whom it has been
unsuccessfully performed (Recommendation 2C).
Statement 30
On the basis of the clinical conditions, the size of the
abscess and the access to interventional radiology,
antibiotics, and/or percutaneous drainage may be
suggested to treat post-operative localized intra￾abdominal abscesses when there are no signs of
generalized peritonitis (Recommendation 2C).
Statement 31
Prompt surgical source control should be performed
following diagnosis of post-operative peritonitis. Ineffect￾ive control of the septic source is associated with signifi￾cantly elevated mortality rates (Recommendation 1C).
Statement 32
Patients with tubo-ovarian abscess that does not
respond to antibiotics should undergo surgical drainage
(Recommendation 1C).
Statement 33
Early surgical intervention is recommended in case of
HVI (Recommendation 1C).
Statement 34
Repair or anastomosis of intestinal injuries should be
considered in all patients. A complete diversion of the
fecal stream could be considered in colorectal injuries
involving all layers in the setting of multiple injuries or
comorbid conditions (Recommendation 1C).
Statement 35
The on-demand re-laparotomy is recommended for
patients with severe peritonitis because its ability to
streamline healthcare resources reduce overall medical
costs and prevent the need for further re-laparotomies
(Recommendation 2A).
Statement 36
The open abdomen may be a viable option for treating
physiologically deranged patients with ongoing sepsis,
facilitating subsequent exploration and control of
abdominal contents, and preventing abdominal
compartment syndrome (Recommendation 1C).
In order to define the role of OA with negative
pressure therapy for improved biomediator clearance
and mitigated systemic sepsis in patients with severe
peritonitis, a prospective trial is needed.
Statement 37
Rapid closure with the assistance of negative pressure
therapy should be the primary objective in the management
of patients with open abdomen, in order to prevent severe
morbidity such as fistulae, loss of domain, and massive
incisional hernias (Recommendation 1B).
Antimicrobial therapy
Statement 38
Knowledge of regional/local rates of resistance, when it
is available, should be always an essential component of
the clinical decision-making process when deciding the
empirical treatment of infection (Recommendation 1C).
Statement 39
Predicting the pathogens and potential resistance patterns
of a given infection begins by establishing whether the
infection is community-acquired or hospital-acquired.
For patients with community-acquired intra-abdominal
infections (CA-IAIs), agents with a narrower spectrum of
activity are preferred. However, in CA-IAI patients at risk
for extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) producing
Enterobacteriaceae infections, anti-ESBL-producer coverage
may be warranted. For patients with hospital-acquired
infections (HA-IAIs), antibiotic regimens with broader
spectra of activity are preferred (Recommendation 1B).
Statement 40
In critically ill patients, antimicrobial therapy should be
started as soon as possible.
In these patients, to ensure timely and effective
administration of antibiotics, clinicians should always
consider the pathophysiological status of the patient as
well as the pharmacokinetic properties of the employed
antibiotics (Recommendation 1B).
Statement 41
In patients with uncomplicated IAI such as uncomplicated
appendicitis and uncomplicated cholecystitis, where the
source of infection is treated definitively, post-operative
antibiotic therapy is not necessary (Recommendation 1A).
Statement 42
In patients with complicated IAI undergoing an
adequate source-control procedure, a short course of
antibiotic therapy (3–5 days) is always recommended
(Recommendation 1A).
Statement 43
Patients who have ongoing signs of peritonitis or
systemic illness (ongoing infection) beyond 5–7 days of
antibiotic treatment should warrant a diagnostic
investigation (Recommendation 1C).
Sartelli et al. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017) 12:29 Page 26 of 34

Statement 44
The choice of empiric antibiotic regimens in patients
with IAI should be based on the clinical condition of the
patients, the individual risk for infection by resistant
pathogens, and the local resistance epidemiology
(Recommendation 1C).
Statement 45
Intra-operative cultures should be always performed in
patients with HA-IAs or with CA- at risk for resistant
pathogens or in critically ill patients. They allow
expansion of the antimicrobial regimen if the initial
choice is too narrow and to perform a de-escalation if
the empirical regimen is too broad.
When a microorganism is identified in clinical
cultures, antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST)
should always be performed and reported to guide
antibiotic therapy (Recommendation 1C).
Statement 46
Knowledge of mechanisms of secretion of antibiotics
into bile may be helpful in designing the optimal
