Background: Existing data on the association of metastatic sites and prognosis of
patients with metastatic testicular malignancy are limited. In this study, the association
of survival outcome and the prognostic value of different metastatic sites in patients with
metastatic testicular cancer was investigated.
Methods: A dataset from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) survey
was selected for a retrospective metastatic testicular cancer cohort study. Patients with
different metastatic sites were divided into corresponding groups for further analysis.
Kaplan-Meier analysis with log-rank test was implemented for comparison of the survival
distribution of cases. Multivariate Cox regression models were then applied to analyze
the association of distant metastases with survival for all selected patients and subgroup
based on different histological type with a single metastatic site.
Results: A total of 1,661 patients treated for metastatic testicular malignant tumors
between 2010 to 2016 were enrolled in this cohort study. Upon initial diagnosis, 61.9,
15.2, 6.7, 6.4, and 36.2% of patients were found to have lung, liver, bone, brain,
and distant lymph nodes metastatic sites, respectively. Patients with lung, liver, or
bone metastases showed more undesirable prognosis for overall survival (OS) and
cancer-specific survival (CSS), in contrast with those with distant lymph node metastases
(all P < 0.05). In comparison with patients with more than one metastatic site, those with
a single metastasis had extended OS and CSS (both P < 0.001). In patients with a single
metastatic site, Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariate Cox regression demonstrated the
association of bone and liver with the worst two groups of OS and CSS. Multivariate Cox
models based on histological type showed different prognostic values of metastases in
patients with seminoma or non-seminomatous germ cell tumors.
Conclusion: There is much heterogeneity in the oncological outcome of site-specific
metastatic patients. Metastatic profiles and the prognostic value of metastases are
dependent on the histological type in TC patients. Distant lymph nodes and lung
metastases indicate favorable prognostic factors, while bone and liver metastases
indicate negative survival outcomes in TC.

Xu et al. Impact of Metastatic Sites on Survival of TC
INTRODUCTION
Testicular cancer (TC), which represents 1% of male neoplasms
and 5% of urological tumors, is the most common solid cancer
in men between 20 and 45 years old (1, 2). With over 9,560 new
cases diagnosed each year in the United States (US), the incidence
of TC has been on the rise for the last 10 years, especially in more
economically-developed areas (2–5). For metastatic TC (mTC),
the treatment load of platinum-based chemotherapy is usually
associated with cure rate. Inappropriate systemic treatment can
result in a low rate of cure, whereas overtreatment may lead to
acute and late adverse events (6, 7). In this regard, characterizing
mTC into different groups based on variant clinical outcome
is indispensable.
Many factors have been demonstrated as contributing to
the prognosis of advanced TC, and metastatic site has an
important role in many malignancies (8, 9). The favorable
prognostic impact of lung is widely known based on the
data from the International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative
Group (IGCCCG) (10). However, several drawbacks limit the
generalizability of previous data in contemporary populations.
For example, historical cohorts were evaluated in this study,
and only a small proportion of the patients received the current
standard chemotherapy (10). Furthermore, despite TC tending to
spread to sites including lung and distant lymph nodes, the risk
of atypical metastases is not negligible (10, 11). Approximately
9–11% of the patients with mTC have atypical metastases
(non-pulmonary) (10, 11). However, little is known about the
prognostic value of non-pulmonary metastases since limited
data exists on the previous findings (10–15). Consequently, to
address this lack of knowledge and to investigate the potential
prognostic value of site-specific metastases in TC, we studied
the association of survival outcome and prognostic value with
different metastatic sites in patients with metastatic cancer in a
retrospective metastatic TC cohort from the US.
METHODS
Cohort Selection and Data Collection
A retrospective metastatic TC cohort including patients with
primary mTC (M1 stage) from 2010 to 2016 was selected
from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)
program dataset. Additional inclusion criteria were as follows:
patients must be no <14 years old of age; TC was the primary
diagnosis of cancer; distant metastatic sites must be documented,
including distant lymph nodes, lung, liver, bone, and brain;
patient received active follow-up; and patients had a survival
length ≥ 1 month. We excluded patients with insufficient data
of pathological characteristics, distant metastases, M1 stage,
extragonadal germ cell tumor, and data of survival outcomes.
Patients with controversial data (e.g., patients at M1a stage
without metastases of lung or distant lymph nodes) were
also excluded from the cohort (Figure S1). Covariates such
as metastatic sites, surgery of primary tumor, TNM stage,
serum tumor markers after orchiectomy, and pathological
characteristics were included in the analysis. Survival time
(months), the status of survival, and cause of death were also
included in the analysis. S stage was obtained according to
different level of patient’s postoperative tumor markers including
alpha fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG),
and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) based on the staging system of
the 2016 Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) of the International
Union Against Cancer (UICC). Data such as systemic therapy,
radiation therapy, and surgery of metastatic site were not
available in the database. Unless specifically emphasized, distant
lymph nodes generally refer to following three conditions: (1)
retroperitoneal lymph nodes specified as above the diaphragm;
(2) external iliac nodes, pelvic nodes and inguinal nodes without
or unknown previous scrotal or inguinal surgery prior to
presentation of the testis tumor; (3) other kinds of metastatic
distant lymph nodes. It is worth noting that external iliac nodes,
pelvic nodes as well as inguinal nodes with previous scrotal or
inguinal surgery prior to presentation of the testis tumor were
classified as regional nodes. And retroperitoneal nodes below the
diaphragm, nodes around spermatic vein, periaortic nodes, and
pericaval nodes were also classified as regional lymph nodes.
Study Outcomes
Overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were the
two major outcomes of this study. OS was defined as the interval
of time from TC diagnosis to death. CSS was defined as the
interval from the date of TC diagnosis to death due to TC or
other causes.
Statistical Analysis
Demographic factors were reported as mean, median, and
interquartile range for continuous variables, and frequency and
proportion for categorical variables. Comparisons of means and
proportions were analyzed by the Student’s t-test and Chi￾squared test, respectively. Survival was analyzed by the Kaplan￾Meier survival analysis. Breslow test as well as log-rank test were
performed to analyze the discrepancies between OS and CSS.
A Cox proportional model with hazard ratios and 95% CI was
then implemented for multivariate analyses of the cohort. All
statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics software
version 20.0 (IBM, NY, US).
RESULTS
Demographic and Clinical Characteristics
Overall, 1,661 patients with mTC were enrolled in the current
study, and were identified according to our defined inclusion
and exclusion criteria (Figure S1). Patients’ demographical
characteristics are shown in Table 1. The average age at diagnosis
was 33.2 years, with a median of 31 years. There was no
significant difference in the distribution of the number of patients
in each year (from 2010 to 2016). Most of the population (90.4%)
was ethnically white. More than two-thirds of the patients were
unmarried. Primary TC on the right side was more common
than on the left side. Approximately 84.3% of patients underwent
radical orchiectomy. Patients’ clinicopathological information
are also summarized in Table 1 according to histological type.
Since the number of patients (n = 80) with non-germ cell
testicular cancer (NGCTC) was too small, these individuals were

seminoma were older than those with non-seminomatous germ
cell tumor (NSGCT) (P < 0.001).
FIGURE 1 | Venn diagram of the distribution of distant metastatic sites in the
overall cohort.
Distribution of Distant Metastases
The distributions and discrepancies in the sites of metastases of
TC patients are illustrated in the Venn diagram of Figure 1. The
most common sites of metastases were lung (1,029 cases, 61.9%),
followed by distant lymph nodes (601 cases, 36.2%), liver (252
cases, 15.2%), bone (112 cases, 6.7%), and brain (106 cases, 6.4%).
Most patients (953, 57.4%) had a single site of distant metastases,
followed by two sites (444, 26.7%), three sites (73, 4.4%), and
four sites (10, 0.6%). No more than four metastatic sites were
found in any one case of the cohort. When classified according
to histological type, the distribution was different than that
of metastases in TC patients (Figures S2A, S2B). Patients with
seminoma usually had distant lymph node metastases (199 cases,
49.4%), followed by that to lung (108 cases, 26.8%) (Figure S2A).
Furthermore, patients with NSGCT were more likely to have
metastases to lung (855 cases, 72.5%), followed by distant lymph
nodes (385 cases, 32.6%) (Figure S2B).
Associations Between Metastatic Sites
and Survival Outcomes
Since it is commonly acknowledged that patients with distant
lymph node metastases have favorable prognoses, we took distant
lymph node metastases as a reference and patients with a
single metastatic site were included in the Kaplan-Meier analysis
(n = 947). Patients with brain metastases were excluded in the
analysis of patients with only one metastasis due to insufficient
samples (only six patients). In Figures 2A–F, it was consistent
with clinical experience that patients diagnosed with liver, lung,
and bone metastases had worse outcomes in the measurement of
both OS and CSS, compared with those with distant lymph node

metastases alone. Using log-rank test to compare the number of
metastatic sites in all patients (n = 1,661) with TC, significantly
longer OS and CSS was observed in patients with one metastatic
site than those with more metastases (OS: HR = 2.196, 95%
CI = 1.760–2.739; CSS: HR = 2.492, 95% CI = 1.964–
3.162; both P < 0.001) (Figures 3A,B) In the subgroup of
patients with only one metastatic site (n = 947), patients
with lymph node and lung metastases showed significantly
longer OS and CSS compared with bone and liver metastases
by log-rank comparison (P < 0.001) (Figures 4A,B). Since
curves of liver metastases and bone metastases crossed with
each other in the Kaplan-Meier analysis, comparisons between
liver and bone metastases required further multivariable Cox
regression analysis.

regression model of single-site metastasis patients. As shown in

prognostic factors for mTC patients both in OS and CSS (all
P < 0.05). S stage was a prognostic factor only for CSS
(P = 0.016). However, it still showed a trend in predicting OS
(P = 0.052). N stage showed no statistical difference in predicting
OS and CSS of mTC patients. In the analysis of metastatic
sites, bone and liver represented the two groups with the worst
prognosis of OS and CSS (all P < 0.05) (Table 2). Lung and brain
metastases did not achieve statistical difference.
Subgroup Analysis Based on Histological
Type
Among mTC patients with single metastases, a total of 251
patients with seminoma and 655 patients with NSGCT were
included in the subgroup analysis, while patients with brain
metastases were excluded (n = 6).
For patients with NSGCT, bone and liver metastases
showed worse outcome than lung and distant lymph
node metastases both in OS and CSS (both P < 0.001)
(Figures 5C,D). The same results could be validated in
multivariable Cox models (Tables 3, 4). Especially, bone
metastases showed a worst outcome compared with the
other three types of metastases (OS: HR = 5.116, 95%
CI = 2.031–13.884; CSS: HR = 5.243, 95% CI = 1.900–14.466;
both P = 0.001).
For patients with seminoma, although there was no
statistical difference in the Kaplan-Meier analysis, it still
showed a certain trend that liver metastases indicated the
worst outcome than the other three types of metastases
both in OS and CSS (Figures 5A,B). Subsequent Cox models
showed the same trend, although they also did not meet
statistical significance (Table 4). Interestingly, patients with bone
metastases show similar survival trend as lung and lymph
node metastases.
DISCUSSION
Prognostic system of testicular cancer proposed by IGCCCG is
widely used. However, data of the IGCCCG (the largest available
dataset) were accumulated from 1975 to 1990, and only a small
proportion of patients received a bleomycin, etoposide, and
cisplatin (BEP)-based regimens. Currently, BEP-based regimen
is the main standard chemotherapy for advanced TC, which

is superior to other combinations of chemotherapy agents
(16). Therefore, many researches questioned the prognostic
value of IGCCCG model in current population. Up to now,
few studies have systematically focused on the association
between metastatic sites and survival in the post-BEP era (12,
17). Our study is the first to comprehensively address the
role of the metastatic site on TC patients’ survival using a
contemporary cohort with a large sample size. We found different
metastatic profiles exist in mTC patients. Patients with seminoma
tend to metastasize to distant nodes, while patients with
NSGCT often develop pulmonary metastases. Notably, our study
provided additional information on site-specific survival for
distant metastases.
Previous studies about the impact of metastatic sites on
prognosis of mTC often enrolled all metastatic populations and
impact of different metastatic sites on survival often affect each
other (10, 18). Since many people involves in multiple metastatic
sites, it is difficult to accurately describe the impact of metastatic
sites on survival.
Therefore, for the first time we conducted further analyses
using a subgroup of patients with a single metastatic site. We
revealed that bone and liver metastases represent the two worst
survival outcomes in all mTC patients, while lung and distant
nodes metastases indicate better survival than other kind of
metastases. We attributed the lack of statistical difference in
patients with brain metastases to the sample size (n = 6).
However, categorization of the patients according to histological
type resulted in different observations. For patients with NSGCT,
distant lymph node and lung metastases showed the best
two outcomes compared with bone and liver metastases, in
line with the IGCCCG database. However, for patients with

seminoma, bone metastases showed a similar survival trend
compared with lung and distant lymph node metastases. Liver
tends to bare the worst survival outcome alone. Interestingly,
subgroup analysis of IGCCCG also reveal a higher 5-year
survival rate of patients of seminoma with bone metastases
than that of lung (10). Consequently, we suppose that the
prognosis of site-specific metastases should be carefully revalued
in the contemporary cohort according to histological type. In
this study, we also found that more sites of metastases were
associated with poorer clinical outcomes, which is easy to
understand. A greater number of metastatic sites commonly
suggest more aggressive biological behavior of the tumor and
worse physical conditions.
Several clinical implications should be highlighted in the
current study. On one hand, our results might inspire physicians
to develop novel therapeutic approaches through a better
understanding of the natural history of TC. On the other hand,
our findings highlight the need to improve the risk stratification
of metastatic patients for identifying candidate for clinical
trials (19, 20).
Despite our current study identifying the association of
prognostic outcomes with different metastatic sites in patients
with metastatic cancer in a large retrospective TC cohort, it
does have some limitations. First, the retrospective nature of
our datasets may lead to incomplete or even contradictory
clinical information. Second, our analyses were prevented from
adjusting for potential confounders due to the lack of information
regarding systemic treatment regimens or surgery toward
metastatic sites, which may impact prognosis of patients (21).
CONCLUSION
There is much heterogeneity regarding oncological outcomes
in site-specific metastatic patients. Different metastatic profiles
and different prognostic values of metastases exist in TC
patients depending on histological type. Distant lymph
nodes and lung metastases are favorable prognostic factors,
while liver metastases indicate negative survival outcomes
in TC.
