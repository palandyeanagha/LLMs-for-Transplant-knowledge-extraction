Abstract
Background: We aimed to determine the effects of treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin on bacterial infections in
patients with hypogammaglobulinemia (HGG) after lung transplantation.
Methods: We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled two-period crossover trial of immune globulin
intravenous (IVIG), 10% Purified (Gamunex, Bayer, Elkhart, IN) monthly in eleven adults who had undergone lung
transplantation more than three months previously. We randomized study participants to three doses of IVIG (or 0.1%
albumin solution (placebo)) given four weeks apart followed by a twelve week washout and then three doses of placebo (or
IVIG). The primary outcome was the number of bacterial infections within each treatment period.
Results: IVIG had no effect on the number of bacterial infections during the treatment period (3 during IVIG and 1 during
placebo; odds ratio 3.5, 95% confidence interval 0.4 to 27.6, p = 0.24). There were no effects on other infections, use of
antibiotics, or lung function. IVIG significantly increased trough IgG levels at all time points (least square means, 765.3 mg/dl
during IVIG and 486.3 mg/dl during placebo, p,0.001). Four serious adverse events (resulting in hospitalization) occurred
during the treatment periods (3 during active treatment and 1 during the placebo period, p = 0.37). Chills, flushing, and
nausea occurred during one infusion of IVIG.
Conclusions: Treatment with IVIG did not reduce the short-term risk of bacterial infection in patients with HGG after lung
transplantation. The clinical efficacy of immunoglobulin supplementation in HGG related to lung transplantation over the
long term or with recurrent infections is unknown.

Introduction
Potent immunosuppressive regimens, consisting of a calcineurin
inhibitor, an anti-metabolite, and corticosteroids, predominantly
target cell-mediated immunity to prevent lung allograft rejection
after lung transplantation. Not surprisingly, lung transplant
recipients suffer from an increased risk of infection by pathogens
such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and
cytomegalovirus despite intensive antimicrobial prophylaxis
[1,2,3,4,5].
Immunosuppressive therapy after solid organ transplantation
may also contribute to humoral immunodeficiency due to
hypogammaglobulinemia (HGG). [6,7,8,9] A recent meta-analysis
suggested that severe HGG after solid organ transplantation is
associated with an increased risk of early infection and all-cause
mortality. [10] In one study of lung transplant recipients, HGG
was identified in 70% of lung transplant recipients, of whom 50%
had very low immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels (,400 mg/dL). [9]
Bacterial, fungal, and viral infections were significantly more
common and survival significantly worse among those with HGG.
We previously found that 58% of lung transplant recipients had
mild incident HGG and 15% had severe HGG, with most
episodes occurring within the first year of transplantation. [7] In
that study, use of mycophenolate mofetil was an independent risk
factor for HGG. We have also shown that the presence of HGG is
associated with an increased risk of pneumonia, supporting the

clinical importance of HGG in our lung transplant recipients. [8]
Moreover, HGG has been reported in recipients of other solid
organ transplants, such as heart and kidney, with significant
clinical implications [11,12,13].
Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy is the current
standard of care for patients with primary and certain secondary
immunodeficiency states. Presently, IVIG is FDA-approved for
treatment of primary humoral immunodeficiency, Kawasaki
syndrome, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and bone marrow
transplant recipients with recurrent infections, pediatric HIV
infection, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. It is well￾established that augmentation of immunoglobulin levels in these
immunodeficiency states results in decreases in bacterial infections
[14].
IVIG therapy could significantly decrease the incidence and/or
severity of infections in lung transplant recipients with HGG,
however the use of IVIG in HGG after solid organ transplantation
has not been well-studied. Despite the potential benefits, IVIG is
relatively difficult to administer (requiring monthly intravenous
infusion), has potential adverse reactions, and is very expensive.
We performed a pilot phase II clinical trial to determine the
efficacy and safety of immunoglobulin supplementation for HGG
after lung transplantation.
Materials and Methods
The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist
are available as supporting information; see Checklist S1 and
Protocol S1.
Ethics Statement
The protocol was approved by the Columbia University
Medical Center (CUMC) Institutional Review Board and the
medical monitor.
Study Design
This was a single-center, randomized double-blind, placebo￾controlled, two-period crossover study to determine the efficacy
and safety of IVIG in patients with HGG after lung transplan￾tation. The original protocol called for the recruitment of 10
subjects; we enrolled one additional subject after one dropped out.
The first subject was randomized in April 2006 and the last subject
by July 2008.
The manuscript was written by the authors, and the decision to
submit the manuscript for publication was made solely by the
authors. This manuscript was sent to the sponsor before
submission for publication, however the sponsor had no right to
delay or require any revisions to this manuscript. The sponsor did
not participate in data analysis or drafting of the manuscript.
Study Participants
We recruited adult lung transplant recipients at Columbia
University Medical Center (CUMC) who were at least 3 months
out from lung transplantation and had HGG (IgG levels ,
500 mg/dL) on two assessments at least one month apart within
three months. Study subjects had to be on a stable medical
regimen for at least one month before enrollment. We excluded
those with acute rejection (defined histologically) or active
infection within one month before enrollment, a contraindication
to IVIG (acute renal failure, severe selective IgA deficiency, known
hypersensitivity to IVIG), pregnancy, or a history of a thrombotic
event within three months. The initial protocol called for IgG
levels ,400 mg/dL, which was increased to ,500 mg/dL due to
slow enrollment. All participants provided written informed
consent. This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov before the
initiation of enrollment (NCT00115778) (http://clinicaltrials.gov/
show/NCT00115778).
Study Procedures
This was a crossover study with two 12 week treatment periods
(separated by a 12 week washout period) comparing immune
globulin intravenous (Human), 10% Caprylate/Chromatolgraphy
Purified (Gamunex) (Bayer, Elkhart, IN) (‘‘IVIG’’) with 0.1%
albumin (‘‘placebo’’). The in vivo half-life of this form of IVIG is
approximately 35 days. The dose of IVIG in this study was
400 mg/kg every 4 weeks, which is a widely used dosage in clinical
practice. The initial infusion rate was 0.01 mL/kg/min, titrated to
a maximum infusion rate of 0.08 mL/kg/min. Placebo was 0.1%
albumin in an equal volume, prepared by the Columbia Research
Pharmacy. IVIG and placebo infusion bags had identical color
and appearance. All participants were pre-medicated with
acetaminophen 650 mg po and diphenhydramine 25 mg po
before every study drug infusion.
The Research Pharmacy at Columbia University randomly
assigned the treatment order. Investigators, study personnel, and
study participants were blinded to the order and identity of the
treatments. IGG levels were not performed during the study;
samples were banked and then run after the conclusion of the
study. Study drug was prepared by an unblinded research
pharmacist and delivered to the infusion suite at our medical
center where each dose of study drug was administered.
Study participants were evaluated at baseline and at Week 4, 8,
12, 24, 28, 32, and 36. The ‘‘Period 1’’ study drug was
administered at baseline and at Week 4 and 8 study visits. The
‘‘Period 2’’ study drug was administered at Week 24, 28, and 32.
There was a twelve week washout period between the Period 1
and Period 2. Phlebotomy was performed on the morning of each
study visit, before infusion of the study drug. Participants
maintained a diary of any new medications or symptoms during
the study period.
Outcome Assessments
The primary outcome was the number of bacterial infections
during the treatment period. Secondary outcomes included viral,
fungal and all non-bacterial infections, hospital admissions,
antimicrobial use, serious bacterial infections, trough IgG levels,
acute rejection, spirometry, and mortality in each period. The
definitions of infectious end points were drawn from an FDA draft
document. [15] The necessary criteria were collected prospectively
and all infectious events were determined with blinding to the
treatment period.
Statistical Analysis
Generalized estimating equations with a compound symmetry
covariance structure and logit link were used to estimate odds
ratios. Linear mixed effects modeling with an autoregressive
covariance structure were used to assess differences in lung
function and IgG levels between treatment arms. Models included
fixed effects for drug and period. Subject was included as a
random effect. Least squares means and 95% confidence intervals
for continuous outcomes are reported. Paired sample analysis was
performed secondarily.
In order to detect a reduction in the mean number of bacterial
infections/patient by one standard deviation over three months
with 80% power at an a level of 0.05, we estimated that we would
need 10 subjects. This effect estimate was similar to the difference
between patients with and without HGG in prior studies. [9] The
crossover design of the trial, in which each subject serves as his or
IVIG for Hypogammaglobulinemia after Lung Transplantation
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 August 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e103908

her own control, allows sufficient power for the detection of a
clinically significant effect of IVIG with only a small number of
patients and is the major strength of this design. For example, a
sample size of 10 patients in a crossover trial has more power to
detect differences than double the sample size using a parallel
group design (i.e., randomizing 10 patients to IVIG and 10
patients to placebo). As we did not have multiple bacterial
infections per patient (see below), the power of the study was less
than anticipated.
The primary analysis proceeded according to the intent-to-treat
principle. All randomized participants were analyzed in their
originally assigned group whether or not they discontinued study
drug. P values,0.05 were considered significant. Analyses were
performed using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). There were
no interim analyses or stopping rules planned a priori for the trial.
Results
We screened 237 lung transplant recipients between January
2005 and July 2008 (Figure 1). Eleven subjects were eligible and
randomized, and 10 completed all study assessments. One subject
discontinued the interventions because of inability to comply with
the schedule of study visits.
Participant characteristics are shown in Table 1. The mean age
was 55 years (range 28 to 66 years) and six (55%) were male. Most
were non-Hispanic white. Six underwent lung transplantation for
COPD and ten had undergone bilateral transplantation. The
median time from transplantation to enrollment was 187 days
(interquartile range 153 to 660 days). Five study participants (45%)
were taking valganciclovir for prophylaxis against cytomegalovi￾rus. The median baseline IgG level for the study sample at
randomization was 487.5 g/dl (IQR 423.5 to 513.8 g/dl), showing
the variability over time in IgG levels (as all patients had IgG levels
,500 g/dl on two assessments at least one month apart within
three months before enrollment).
Subjects received the study treatments in the assigned order.
One participant experienced chills, flushing, and nausea during
infusion of IVIG. No other infusion-related adverse events
occurred. Study drug was discontinued in one subject because of
inability to comply with study visits. There were no period or
carryover effects.
During the IVIG period, there were three bacterial infections (in
three patients) compared to the placebo period, when there was
one bacterial infection (in one patient) (odds ratio (OR) 3.5, 95%
CI 0.4 to 27.6, p = 0.24; Table 2). Paired sample analyses showed
similar results (data not shown). Similarly, there were non￾Figure 1. Study flow.

significant increases in overall infections (IVIG-7 vs. placebo-3,
OR 2.7, 95% CI 0.95 to 7.6, p = 0.06), antibiotic initiation (IVIG￾9 vs. placebo-8, OR 1.4, 9% CI 0.3 to 6.0, p = 0.61), and
hospitalization (IVIG-3 vs. placebo-1, OR 3.5, 95% CI 0.2 to
51.2, p = 0.37; Table 2) during the IVIG period compared to the
placebo period. IVIG had no significant effect on lung function
over three months (Table 3). As expected, the administration of
IVIG significantly increased IgG levels throughout the treatment
period compared to placebo (Table 3; Figure 2).
Table 4 shows the adverse events during the IVIG and placebo
periods. Five serious adverse- events occurred during the study,
and four during a treatment period. Three (pancreatitis, vitreous
hemorrhage, and E. coli pneumonia) occurred during the IVIG
period and one (hospital admission for thymoglobulin infusion)
during the placebo period. There was a hospitalization for a fall
during the washout period. The most common adverse events
were bronchoscopy (in .50% of participants in both periods).
Cough and neck stiffness were more common during IVIG
periods.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled clinical trial of IVIG for HGG after lung
transplantation. In a crossover design, we did not find a significant
impact of IVIG on bacterial infections or other infectious episodes,
despite observing expected increases in IgG levels following IVIG
administration. Adverse events were mild and common during
both IVIG and placebo periods.
Previous studies have shown associations between the presence
of HGG after lung transplant and worse outcomes. We previously
demonstrated that lung transplant recipients with severe HGG
(IgG,400 mg/dl) had a higher cumulative incidence of pneumo￾nia (63%) compared to that of recipients without HGG (18%),
(p = 0.01), but there was no significant increase in the risk of CMV
disease. [8] Those with severe HGG also had an increased risk of
death. The incidence of severe HGG was about 15% in our prior
studies, [7,8] however other investigators have demonstrated even
higher prevalences of HGG after lung transplantation. [9] A
recent study in pediatric lung transplant recipients found an
association between HGG and the risk of infections and
hospitalization. [16] More recently, lower post-transplant IgG
levels were associated with an increased risk of BOS [6].

IVIG for Hypogammaglobulinemia after Lung Transplantation
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 August 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e103908

While supplementation using IVIG in HGG after solid organ
transplantation would be presumed to be effective, there are
several reasons why it may not be. Organ transplant recipients
receive a medical regimen that not only reduces B cell function
(and antibody production), but also T cell function. HGG might
be an epiphenomenon of reduced T cell function and merely
replacing antibodies might not improve defenses against infection.
To our knowledge, there is only one other RCT of immuno￾globulin replacement for HGG in thoracic organ transplantation.
Yamani et al. studied the use of Cytogam in patients with IgG
levels between 350 and 500 mg/dl in a randomized, double-blind
placebo controlled trial with 13 patients randomized to Cytogam
and 10 patients randomized to placebo (5% dextrose). [18] An
average of only 1.4 doses were administered per patient, without a
standard regimen. The investigators found a decrease in the
number of episodes of CMV disease, but no other differences
between the groups. These results may not be generalizable as this
study 1) used Cytogam in patients who received valganciclovir for
CMV prophylaxis for only 4 weeks after transplantation, 2) on
average only administered 1–2 doses of study drug for the entire
study period, 3) only showed an effect on CMV infection (defined
as a positive CMV PCR with fever, malaise, leukopenia, or other
evidence of organ disease), and 4) demonstrated no effect on
bacterial infections. These data may be difficult to extrapolate to
the chronic use of IVIG in lung transplant patients with HGG
receiving more prolonged CMV prophylaxis.
Our study had several limitations. While the crossover design
provided more power than we would have had with .20 subjects
studied in a parallel design, there were few outcomes and our
findings could very well be attributable to inadequate power. For
the crossover design to be valid, we needed to ensure clinical
stability over the time of both treatment periods, necessarily
limiting the duration of each. Longer studies with greater numbers
of patients would be necessary to detect smaller differences in
outcomes. The primary statistical analysis may be anti-conserva￾tive in small samples, however no differences in the primary end
point were seen and paired sample analyses were similar. We
recruited patients with low IgG levels documented twice over a
short period of time. Even so, some of the patients in the study had
IgG levels .500 mg/dl at the time of randomization and during
the placebo period. This was not attributable to a carryover effect
(i.e., the effect of IVIG treatment during the first period continuing
into the second period), but likely reflects the variable nature of
IgG levels over time. While reflecting the ‘‘real world’’ application
of IVIG (i.e., some patients clinically diagnosed with HGG based
on two IgG levels in whom IVIG might be prescribed will go on to
have IgG levels which are higher), it is possible that IgG levels .
500 mg/dl during the placebo period could have led to bias to the
null, even though the study subjects had significantly higher levels
of IgG at every time point during treatment with IVIG. Finally,
one participant dropped out early in the first period, which could
have reduced power as well.
In summary, monthly IVIG therapy did not reduce the
incidence of bacterial or other infections compared to placebo
over three months in stable adult lung transplant recipients with
HGG. Our results do not support the routine clinical use of IVIG
in patients with HGG after lung transplant. However, it is
unknown whether IVIG may be effective for lung transplant
recipients with HGG and repeated or refractory bacterial, fungal,
or viral infections.
