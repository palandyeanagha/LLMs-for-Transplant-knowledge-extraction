Abstract


The Val30Met transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy (TTR-
V30M-FAP) is the most frequent familial amyloidosis, with
autosomal dominant transmission. This severe disease shows
important differences in age of onset and penetrance. Recently, a
difference in penetrance according to the gender of the transmitting
parent was elicited in different geographic areas with a higher
penetrance in case of maternal transmission of the trait. In addition,
differences in mitochondrial haplogroup distribution in early and
late onset Swedish and French cases of TTR-V30M-FAP suggested
that a polymorphism of mitochondrial DNA could be one
underlying mechanism of the phenotypic variation. We further
investigated this hypothesis by modeling the penetrance function
with a parent-of-origin and/or a mitochondrial polymorphism effect
in samples of Portuguese (n=33) and Swedish families (n=86) with
TTR-V30M-FAP in which several individuals had been tested for
mitochondrial haplogroups. Our analysis showed that a
mitochondrial polymorphism effect was sufficient to explain the
observed difference in penetrance according to gender of the
transmitting parent in the Portuguese sample, whereas, in the
Swedish sample, a clear residual parent-of-origin effect remained.
This study further supported the role of a mitochondrial
polymorphism effect that might induce a higher penetrance in case
of maternal inheritance of the disease. In clinical practice, these
results might help to better delineate the individual disease risk and
have a significant impact on the management of both patients and
carriers.
