SOUHRN
Účel/cíl: V předchozích studiích bylo popsáno prodloužení intervalu QT u pacientů s cirhózou jater. Naším 
cílem bylo zkoumat změny na elektrokardiografi ckém (EKG) záznamu a jejich korelaci se závažností 
onemocnění u pacientů s cirhózou. 
Metody: Ve studii bylo vyšetřeno celkem 69 pacientů s cirhózou. Prodloužení korigovaného intervalu QT 
a nízkovoltážní komplexy QRS na EKG záznamu byly zkříženě porovnány s klinickými a biochemickými údaji. 
Byla zkoumána spojitost EKG nálezů se závažností cirhózy podle Childova-Pughova skóre i skóre z modelu 
terminálního nemocnění jater (model for end-stage liver diseases, MELD).
Výsledky: Prodloužení intervalu QT bylo zjištěno u 63,5 % pacientů a 57,7 % jich splnilo kritéria 
nízkovoltážních komplexů QRS. U pacientů s prodlouženými intervaly QT sice byly zjištěny vyšší hodnoty 
Childova-Pughova skóre (9,58 ± 2,5, resp. 8,16 ± 2,29; p = 0,04), avšak při použití MELD byly hodnoty skóre 
při prodlouženém intervalu QT a nízkovoltážní EKG křivky podobné. Častost výskytu prodlouženého inter￾valu QT a nízkovoltážních komplexů QRS byla u pacientů v různých třídách Childovy-Pughovy klasifi kace 
podobná. U pacientů s nízkovoltážní EKG křivkou byla vyšší i srdeční frekvence (89 ± 15 tepů/min, resp. 79 
± 16 tepů/min; p = 0,01). Průměrná voltáž komplexu QRS v prekordiálních svodech byla u pacientů s ascitem 
nižší (8,5 ± 2,6 mV vs. 11,8 ± 3,4 mV; p = 0,006).
Závěr: Změny na elektrokardiogramu jsou u cirhózy bez ohledu na závažnost onemocnění časté. Přítomnost 
nízkovoltážních komplexů QRS může souviset s antropomorfními změnami a s rozvojem ascitu u této 
skupiny pacientů.

ABSTRACT
Purpose/aim: Previous studies reported prolongation of QT interval in cirrhotic patients. We aimed to inves￾tigate the electrocardiographic changes and their correlation with the disease severity in cirrhotic patients. 
Methods: Sixty-nine cirrhotic patients were examined. The prolongation of corrected QT interval and low-
-voltage QRS in electrocardiography were cross-examined for clinical and biochemical data. The association 
of electrocardiographic fi ndings with the severity of cirrhosis, as determined by both Child-Pugh and model 
for end-stage liver diseases (MELD) scores, was investigated.

128 ECG in cirrhosis
Introduction
Cirrhosis, which is the late stage of progressive hepatic 
fi brosis, makes patients susceptible to several complica￾tions [1]. Cardiac dysfunction in cirrhotic patients, which 
was once believed to be the result of alcoholic toxicity, 
is now considered because of the disease process [2,3]. 
Diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle is described in 
majority of patients with cirrhosis. However, the other 
devastating consequences of cirrhosis may obscure the 
emergence of other cardiac complications [2,3].
Prolongation of QT-interval is a common electrocar￾diographic (ECG) fi nding in cirrhotic patients that is an 
indication of extended repolarization phase prolongati￾on in cardiac muscle [2,4,5]. Prolongation of QT-interval is 
associated with a higher mortality rate among the affec￾ted individuals [6]. Low-voltage ECG is another fi nding 
that is rarely investigated in cirrhotic patients. A recent 
study has revealed that presence of low-voltage ECG in 
patients with no prior cardiovascular diseases increases 
mortality in affected individuals [7]. A low-voltage ECG 
in any patient may indicate the presence of another im￾portant underlying problem such as cardiac ischemia and 
pericardial effusion [8,9].
This study was conducted to investigate the frequen￾cy of electrocardiographic changes in cirrhotic patients 
and to further investigate whether these changes (QT-
-prolongation and or low-voltage QRS pattern) have any 
correlation to the severity of liver disease as assessed by 
Child-Pugh and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) 
scores. Our primary hypothesis was that QT prolongati￾on and the low-voltage pattern were frequently seen in 
patients with cirrhosis and their frequency or extent inc￾reased, as the disease process was further advanced. 
Patients and methods
The study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional 
Review Board Committee at Tabriz University of Medical 
Sciences (Tabriz, Iran). Due to the retrospective design of 
this study involving chart reviews, which poses no more 
than minimal risk to the participants, the requirement for 
informed consent was waived. However, appropriate ste￾ps were taken to maintain complete patient privacy.
Patient population
All patients admitted to the Gastroenterology Services 
from March 2011 through December 2013 with a diagno￾sis of cirrhosis were reviewed. One hundred and ninety re￾cords were screened and 121 patients were excluded for 
the following reasons: cardiac related diseases including 
patients with a history of ischemic heart disease (history 
of or electrocardiographic evidence of prior myocardial 
infection, history of coronary revascularization) (30), con￾gestive heart failure (9) and implantation of cardiac pace￾maker (3); renal insuffi ciency Stage 3 or above (33 cases) 
and pulmonary-related disease (25 cases) as assessed by 
history, clinical evaluation and laboratory data. A further 
21 patients were excluded for other reasons including 
having incomplete medical records or taking medicati￾ons known to adversely affect ECG changes. After these 
exclusions were taken into consideration, 69 patients in 
total were included in this study. All patients were in nor￾mal sinus rhythm with no extrasystoles. Demographic and 
anthropomorphic (e.g., height, weight, BMI) data were 
collected from source documents and entered into the 
study datasheet.
The presence of cirrhosis was confi rmed on clinical, bio￾chemical, and histological grounds as available. The seve￾rity of cirrhosis was determined by two separate clinical 
assessments: the Child-Pugh classifi cation and the MELD 
[10–12]. In terms of the Child-Pugh classifi cation, patients 
were scored according to standard criteria as done in cli￾nical practice and allocated into three groups based on 
their Child’s class (i.e., Class A, Class B or Class C). With 
regard to MELD scoring, the following standard formula 
was used: 9.6 × loge (creatinine mg/dL) + 3.8 × loge (total 
bilirubin mg/dL) + 11.2 × loge (INR) + 6.4. In addition, the 
following scoring modifi cations as used by the United Ne￾twork for Organ Sharing (UNOS) were made: values of 
creatinine, bilirubin, and INR below 1 were rounded to 1, 
and creatinine was assigned a value of 4 if patients had 
received hemodialysis at least twice within the last 7 days 
prior to scoring. MELD scores with and without UNOS mo￾difi cations were calculated and no signifi cant difference 
was observed. We additionally calculated MELD-Na by 
adding MELD to 1.59 × (135 – Na) which has been shown 
to predict the mortality in patients with cirrhosis.
The etiology of cirrhosis, presence of ascites and he￾patic encephalopathy were recorded for all patients. The 
various etiologies of cirrhosis were determined based on 
history of alcohol intake of 80 gm/day for males or 60 gm/
day for females for at least 10 years for alcoholic cirrhosis, 
and presence of hepatitis B and C specifi c antigen/anti￾bodies for post hepatitis cirrhosis and history established 
autoimmune disease for autoimmune causes. In the ab￾sence of any of aforementioned evidence, the etiology of 
cirrhosis was recorded as unknown. Ascites and hepatic 
encephalopathy were evaluated clinically and rated as fo￾llows: 0 = none; 1 = medically controlled; 2 = poorly con￾trolled. Laboratory data required for clinical assessment 
Results: QT-interval prolongation was detected in 63.5% patients and 57.7% met the criteria for low-voltage 
QRS. Patients with prolonged QT-interval had higher Child-Pugh scores (9.58 ± 2.5 vs. 8.16 ± 2.29 respec￾tively, p = 0.04) but model for end-stage liver diseases scores was similar in those with prolonged QT and 
low-voltage electrocardiogram. The frequency of prolonged QT interval and low-voltage QRS were similar 
among patients with different Child-Pugh classes. Heart rate was also higher in patients with low-voltage 
electrocardiogram (89 ± 15 beats per minute vs. 79 ± 16 beats per minute, p = 0.01). Mean QRS voltage in 
precordial leads was lower in those with ascites (8.5 ± 2.6 mV vs. 11.8 ± 3.4 mV, p = 0.006).
Conclusion: Electrocardiographic changes are common in cirrhosis regardless of the disease severity. Low-
-voltage QRS may be related to anthropomorphic changes and development of ascites in these patients.

of cirrhosis including serum concentrations of albumin, 
bilirubin, prothrombin time, international normalized 
ratio (INR) and creatinine were also documented for all 
patients. 
Electrocardiographic measurements
The standard 12-lead electrocardiogram tracing was re￾corded using a paper speed of 25 mm/s at 10 mm/mV am￾plitude for each patient. A cardiologist who was blinded 
to the medical history of the patient manually reviewed 
all 12-lead electrocardiographic tracing and recorded the 
measurements. Maximum QRS voltage in all limb (I, II, III, 
aVR, aVL and aVF) and precordial leads (V1–V6), as well as 
the intervals for P, PR, QRS, R-R and QT were measured. 
Both sum and mean voltage for limb leads and precordial 
leads were separately recorded. In leads II, V5 and V6, QT 
interval was measured from the beginning of QRS com￾plex to the end point of T-wave and the longest interval 
was identifi ed. If a U wave was present, the measurement 
of QT interval was performed to the nadir of the curve 
between the T wave and U wave. The average of the QT 
interval in 3 consecutive heartbeats in the lead with the 
longest QT interval was reported. The returning of T wave 
to isoelectric line was considered as the termination of T 
wave. The low-voltage ECG, defi ned as a QRS amplitude 
< 10 mm in the precordial and < 5 mm in all limb leads. 
QT-interval was corrected for R-R interval and recorded 
as QTc. The QT-interval was corrected using the standard 
clinical correction (Bazett’s formula): QTc = QT/√RR. QT 
prolongation was identifi ed when QTc values were > 440 
ms (milliseconds) for males and > 460 ms for females. 
Statistical analysis
Statistical software SPSS 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) 
was used for data analysis. Electrographic measurement 
of QRS voltage and evidence for QT prolongation were 
the primary endpoints of this study. Continuous varia￾bles were presented as the mean ± standard deviation. 
Categorical variables were reported as frequencies and 
percentages. Independent t-test was used to compare the 
severity scores for those with and without QT prolongati￾on. For comparison of numerical variables in polynomial 
groups, one-way ANOVA test was used with Bonferroni 
post hoc test to compare inter-groups variables. Cate￾gorical variables were compared between groups with 
chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. Mul￾tivariate linear regression models were constructed to 
examine the level of contribution of independent factors 
on the length of QT interval. Variable selection was based 
on multiple univariate analysis that showed any trend to￾ward signifi cance with p values < 0.100. P values less than 
0.05 were considered statistically signifi cant. 
Results
A total number of 69 patients with cirrhosis were studied. 
Forty-fi ve of the 69 patients were male (65.2%) and the 
remaining 24 were female (34.8%). The mean age of all 
patients was 56.8 ± 16.0 years. The most common cause 
of cirrhosis was hepatitis B (40.6%) followed by alcoho￾lic cirrhosis (21.7%) and hepatitis C (7.2%). In the remai￾ning patients, the etiology was either unknown (24.6%) 
or due to an autoimmune process (5.8%; categorized as 
“Others”) (Table 1). The 69 patients were divided into 3 
groups according to their Child-Pugh Classifi cation: 14 
patients (20.3%) in Class A, 28 patients (40.5%) in Class 
B and 27 patients (39.1%) in Class C (Table 2). Severity 
of liver disease was confi rmed by comparing mean MELD 
scores in each respective group (Class A: 12.9 ± 4.7; Class 
B: 16.3 ± 5.6; Class C: 20.6 ± 7.0, p < 0.001). With regards 
to differences in serum electrolytes between the three 
classes, there was a signifi cant decrease in serum sodium 
with increasing Child Class and thus severity of liver dise￾ase (Class A: 142 ± 3; Class B: 139 ± 4; Class C: 136 ± 5 mE￾q/L, p < 0.001). There was no signifi cant difference in total 
calcium, ionized calcium or potassium. As patients with 
renal insuffi ciency were excluded, serum creatinine did 
not vary signifi cantly between the three groups (Table 2).
Various electrocardiographic fi ndings between pati￾ents in the three Child classes were also compared (Table 
3). Only the heart rate, which increased with progression 
of Child class severity, differed signifi cantly (Class A: 77 ± 
17; Class B: 83 ± 16; Class C: 89 ± 18 beats per minute, p = 
0.029) (Table 3). However, approximately half of patients 
in each Child Class demonstrated a prolonged QTc-in￾terval (42.9% in Child class A, 57.1% in Child class B and 
48.1% in Child class C, p < 0.644), which refl ected the pro￾portion of patients overall with a prolonged QTc-interval 
(50.7% or 35/69 patients). A similar pattern was also seen 
with regards to low-voltage ECG fi ndings. Approximately 
one-third to one-half of patients in each Child class had 
low-voltage ECG fi ndings (35.7% in class A, 50% in class 
B and 50% in class C, p = 0.634), and about half of pati￾ents overall had low-voltage ECG fi ndings either in the 
precordial or limb leads (46.4% or 32/69 patients). Speci￾fi cally, 19 out of 69 patients (30.6%) had low-voltage ECG 
in precordial leads and 24 out of 69 (38.7%) had low-vol￾Table 1 – Etiology of cirrhosis according to Child-Pugh classifi cation.

Patients in our study were also grouped into two classes 
based on the absence or presence of a prolonged QT-in￾terval, and the two groups were compared in terms of 
laboratory values, clinical features, ECG fi ndings and seve￾rity of cirrhosis (Table 5). Patients with a prolonged QTc-
-interval had a signifi cantly lower serum creatinine than 
patients with a normal QTc-interval (1.0 ± 0.3 vs 1.2 ± 0.3, 
p = 0.013). There were no signifi cant differences between 
the two groups in terms of other fi ndings including serum 
electrolytes, mean heart rate, and mean Child and MELD 
scores (p > 0.05 for all variables). In linear regression mo￾dels, serum creatinine is the only independent factor that 
signifi cantly correlates with QT interval. For every 1 mg/
dL of serum creatinine concentration, Q interval prolongs 
13.5 ms (p = 0.040) (Table 6).
Patients were then allocated into two groups based on 
the absence or presence of low-voltage ECG, and similar 
to the previous analysis, the two groups were compared in 
terms of laboratory, clinical and ECG fi ndings. When com￾pared to patients with normal ECG voltage, patients with 
low ECG voltage had a signifi cantly higher mean MELD 
score (21.1 ± 7.2 vs 17.8 ± 6.2 mV, p = 0.038) as well as 
lower serum albumin levels (2.9 ± 0.5 vs. 3.3 ± 0.6 mV, p = 
0.045). Patients with low-voltage ECG also had signifi cant￾ly higher heart rates (89 ± 18 vs. 80 ± 15 beats per minute, 
p = 0.030) and were signifi cantly older (60.2 ± 12.6 vs. 53.2 
± 17.7 years, p = 0.049). In contrast to patients with a pro￾longed QTc-interval, patients with low-voltage ECG did 
not demonstrate a signifi cant difference in serum creati￾nine levels from patients with normal voltage (1.1 ± 1.4 vs. 
1.0 ± 0.4, respectively; p = 0.39). There was also no diffe￾rence in mean Child scores or serum electrolytes between 
the two groups. The presence of ascites also occurred in si￾milar proportions of patients with or without low-voltage 
ECG (59.4% vs. 55.6%, respectively; p = 0.47) (Table 6).
By excluding the patients with low-voltage limb leads, 
the mean QRS voltage in precordial limbs was signifi cantly 
lower in patients with ascites (8.8 ± 2.7 mV vs. 11.1 ± 3.4 
mV, p = 0.018). However, the reverse was not true and by 
excluding the patients with low-voltage precordial leads, 
there was no difference in mean limb lead voltage in pati￾ents with and those without ascites (4.6 ± 1.4 mV vs. 5.5 ± 
2.7 mV, respectively; p = 0.118).
Discussion
ECG abnormalities have been commonly seen with cirrho￾sis [5]. Prolongation of the QT-interval and low-voltage of 
QRS complex were thought to refl ect cardiac dysfunction 
secondary to cirrhosis through undetermined mechanisms 
[2,15]. A direct correlation was described between the QT-
-prolongation and the ventricular loading in patients with 
severe cirrhosis [16]. In this study, QTc-prolongation was 
present in approximately 50% of the patients regardless 
of disease severity. This fi nding indicates that QTc-prolon￾gation can be found in early, well-compensated cirrhosis 
as well as late stages of the disease. 
Additionally, our study showed that Child-Pugh sco￾res tend to be higher in patients with QT-prolongation 
although there was no difference in QT-interval and the 
frequency of QT-prolongation among difference classes 
of cirrhosis. A retrospective review of 48 cirrhotic patients 
described that the prevalence of QTc-prolongation rose 
from 19% in Class A 86% in Class C.17 However, when the 
patients were analyzed according to etiology, they found 
that 15 out of 18 or 83% of patients with alcoholic cirrho￾sis had a QTc > 440 ms, whereas only 20% of patients with 
post-viral cirrhosis had the same abnormality. Furthermo￾re, they noted that the severity of the disease was higher 
in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. In a study of 94 cirrho￾tic patients, the prevalence of abnormal QTc rose from 
25% in Class A to 60% in Class C and QTc-interval corre￾lated with Child-Pugh scores [5]. Although the prevalence 
of prolonged QTc or its duration did not differ between 
patients with alcoholic versus nonalcoholic cirrhosis, the 
authors could not rule out the role of alcohol toxicity in 
QT-prolongation.
In other studies that also noted a correlation between 
cirrhosis severity and QTc-prolongation, alcoholic etiology 
similarly played a confounding role. Majority of patients 
(85.7%) with Class C and 53.4% in Class B had alcohol-
-related cirrhosis compared with only 15.4% of patients 
in Class A. In addition when the slope of the regression 
line QT/RR was calculated, patients with alcoholic cirrhosis 
had a steeper QT/RR slope than patients with viral cirrho￾sis, indicating that QTc was prolonged to a greater extent 
as the heart rate decreased [18]. Likewise, in a study by 
Bal and Thuluvath, QTc prolongation was more common￾ly seen in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis (60%) as com￾pared with non-alcoholic cirrhosis, and alcoholic etiology 
was an independent predictor of QT-interval prolongati￾on [4]. In contrast, Pozzi et al. found that the structural 
heart abnormalities were present more frequently even in 
pre-cirrhotic patients with HCV infection [19].
Electrolyte abnormalities are common in cirrhotic pati￾ents and lower calcium level described in cirrhotic patients 
with QT-prolongation [17]. Genovesi et al. noted that the 
three Child groups had modest but signifi cant difference 
in calcium levels [17]. Calcium levels decreased from 1.25 
mg/dL in Class A to 1.22 mg/dL in Class C and the QTc-inter￾val duration was inversely correlated with plasma calcium 
ion concentration. Thus, serum concentrations of ionized 
calcium confound the positive association between QTc-
-prolongation and Child class. In this study, patients with 
ionized calcium abnormality were all excluded to eliminate 
the role of serum calcium. This may suggest the contributi￾on of other intrinsic cardiac factors rather than electrolyte 
disturbance in pathogenesis of cardiac abnormalities. 
Similar to our fi ndings, in a prospective study of 48 ci￾rrhotics, Henriksen et al. showed an increased prevalence 
of QTc-prolongation in cirrhotics without any correlation 
to the severity [20]. They claimed that this higher prevalen￾ce was due to the fact that a majority of the patients had 
alcoholic liver cirrhosis (43/48). However, alcoholic etio￾logy was considerably less common among our patients 
despite the higher prevalence of QT-prolongation. These 
authors did observe, however, that patients with cirrhosis 
have deranged hemodynamics and abnormal coupling of 
electrical and mechanical systole and proposed that this 
fi nding may be due to mechanical cardiac defects due to 
portal hypertension. 
Lastly, Kosar et al. also investigated the relationship be￾tween QT-dispersion and Child-Pugh Class, and found that 
127_136_Puvodni sdeleni Pourafkari.indd 133 10/04/2017 11:16:16

134 ECG in cirrhosis
QT-dispersion increased from Class A to Class C but was 
not different between Class A and Class B [6]. This study is 
mainly limited by the fact that the reliability of QT-disper￾sion is signifi cantly lower than that of the QT-interval, 
and QT-dispersion is considered a crude refl ection of ven￾tricular repolarization abnormalities as shown by others 
[21]. As such, only grossly abnormal values (> 100 ms) may 
have practical value, whereas authors of this study used 
a much lower cut-off (> 70 ms). Patel et al., similarly re￾ported higher INR in patients with prolonged QT-interval 
[22], while another group found no relationship between 
the severity of liver disease as determined by the MELD 
and QT-prolongation among 117 cirrhotic patients [23].
In our study, neither the mean QTc-interval duration 
nor the prevalence of QTc-prolongation correlated with 
Child Class severity. The difference between these fi ndings 
and those of previous studies may be explained by the ab￾sence of specifi c confounders and limitations as mentio￾ned above. In this study, the proportion of patients with 
alcoholic cirrhosis did not differ signifi cantly between the 
three classes and did not differ between patients with or 
without QT-prolongation, which minimizes the confoun￾ding infl uence of alcohol toxicity. Separating the effects of 
alcohol is critical because it is well established that harm￾ful levels cause cardiac dysfunction and QT-prolongation 
independent of liver cirrhosis. Patients with low calcium 
were also excluded in this study, elimination the effect of 
this electrolyte abnormality on ventricular repolarization. 
Furthermore, regardless of correlation to Child score, the 
prevalence of QT-interval in well-compensated cirrhosis is 
not negligible, both in the aforementioned studies as well 
as in this one [4,6]. The consistency of this fi nding strongly 
suggests the potential role of other underlying factors in 
developing cardiac abnormalities beside liver disease se￾verity. 
Another important fi nding in this study is the attenua￾tion of QRS voltage in both precordial and limb leads in 
a relatively high proportion of cirrhotic patients. As with 
QT-prolongation, the presence of low-voltage QRS com￾plex in ECG is associated with impaired cardiac function and 
increased mortality [8]. Both cardiac and extra-cardiac etio￾logies including peripheral edema, ascites, hypovolemia 
and various pulmonary diseases can potentially affect the 
electrical conductivity of tissue and pericardial fl uid. 
Similar to QT-prolongation, while low-voltage was 
common in cirrhosis, there was no correlation to disease 
severity. This fi nding strengthens the notion that cardiac 
dysfunction may be present even in early stages of the 
disease. Furthermore, when patients were grouped by 
the presence or absence of low-voltage, patients with 
low-voltage have signifi cantly lower serum albumin con￾centrations as well signifi cantly higher MELD and MELD-
-Na scores. Lower serum albumin may contribute to and 
exacerbate peripheral edema while hyponatremia, which 
is caused by solute-free water retention, is considered an 
indirect marker of portal hypertension. Serum sodium 
concentration was found to be a sensitive, independent 
predictor of mortality with decreases as little as 1 mEq sig￾nifi cantly affecting survival in cirrhosis. Indeed, MELD-Na 
captures a subset of patients with refractory ascites and 
low sodium that are typically underscored by MELD but 
have a high risk of early death. 
Madias reported low-voltage ECG in two patients with 
cirrhosis, ascites and peripheral edema who were closely 
followed for a number of years [24]. They noted that low-
-voltage state became more profound with fl uid overlo￾ad and responded well to diuresis. Repeated abdominal 
paracentesis (up to 10 L ascites removed) did not affect 
the QRS voltage, they suggested that low-voltage was not 
associated with ascites and was likely due to peripheral 
edema alone. On the other hand, in 20 patients with asci￾tes (of which half were cirrhosis-related) and showed that 
low-voltage was seen in both limb and precordial leads 
[25]. They proposed that low-voltage was due to upwards 
displacement of the heart by increased intra-abdominal 
pressure and could be temporarily corrected by more cra￾nially placing the precordial leads. 
In our study population, patients with ascites had similar 
rates of low-voltage criteria that include patients with low 
QRS voltage in either limb or precordial leads. However, by 
considering the patients with low-voltages in only the pre￾cordial limbs, patients with ascites had signifi cantly lower 
voltage in precordial leads as compared to those without 
ascites, confi rming Cuculi’s fi nding. This may suggest a di￾fferent pathophysiological process for developing low-vol￾tage ECG in limb and precordial leads as Cuculi pointed out, 
with low-voltages in the precordial leads more specifi c for 
ascites than peripheral edema. While we did not fi nd a sig￾nifi cant difference between low ECG voltages in the limb 
leads, QRS attenuation can be a normal variant particularly 
in the limb leads. Additionally, patients with refractory as￾cites typically have the poorest prognosis. 
The present study is limited by its retrospective design. 
Automatic QTc measurement by ECG device may not be 
accurate partly because of the inconsistency between al￾gorithms used for interval calculations [26]. Accordingly 
manual reading is preferred and was utilized in this stu￾dy. The fi ndings in our study are important and clinically 
signifi cant for several reasons. First, we confi rm previous 
studies that ECG abnormalities are common in cirrhotic 
patients. In addition, our fi ndings serve to help clarify 
the controversy regarding the effect of cirrhosis severity 
and related clinical symptoms on the emergence of car￾diac complications [4,27,28]. Our results show that both 
QTc-prolongation and attenuation of QRS voltage are 
not related to liver severity and that these ECG changes 
are present even in well-compensated cirrhosis. Whether 
screening stable compensated patients for prolongation 
of QT interval infl uence the survival of the patients needs 
to be determined.
