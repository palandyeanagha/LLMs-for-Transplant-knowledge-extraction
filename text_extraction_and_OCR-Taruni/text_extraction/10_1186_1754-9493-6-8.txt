Abstract
Background: The adoption of robotic assistance has contributed to the increased utilization of partial
nephrectomy for the management of renal tumors. However, partial nephrectomy can be technically challenging
because of intraoperative hemorrhage, which limits the ability to identify the tumor margin and may necessitate
the conversion to open surgery or radical nephrectomy. To our knowledge, a comprehensive safety checklist does
not exist to guide surgeons on the management of hemorrhage during robotic partial nephrectomy. We
developed such an safety checklist based on the cumulative experiences of high volume robotic surgeons.
Methods: A treatment safety checklist for the management of hemorrhage during robotic partial nephrectomy
was collaboratively developed based on prior experiences with intraoperative hemorrhage during robotic partial
nephrectomy.
Results: Reducing the risk of hemorrhage during robotic partial nephrectomy begins with reviewing the
preoperative imaging for renal vasculature and tumor anatomy, with a focus on accessory vessels and renal tumor
proximity to the renal hilum. During hilar exposure, an attempt is made to identify additional accessory renal
arteries. The decision is then made on whether to clamp the hilum (artery +/- vein). If bleeding is encountered
during resection, management is based on whether the bleeding is suspected to be arterial or from venous
backbleeding. Operative maneuvers that may increase the chance of success are highlighted in safety checklists for
arterial and venous bleeding.
Conclusions: Safely performing robotic partial nephrectomy is dependent on attention to prevention of
hemorrhage and rapid response to the challenge of intraoperative bleeding. Preparation is essential for maximizing
the chance of success during robotic partial nephrectomy.

Introduction
Hemorrhage during surgery is a patient safety concern
and a source of stress for surgeons. During partial
nephrectomy, in which part of the kidney is removed for
a renal tumor, hemorrhage can be particularly trouble￾some because the kidney is a well perfused organ and
renal cell carcinomas are associated with increased vascu￾larity [1]. Traditionally, partial nephrectomy had been
performed via an open approach but there has been a
steady trend toward a minimally invasive approach [2].
As partial nephrectomy is increasingly performed with
a minimally invasive approach, control of intraoperative
hemorrhage can be more challenging than simple man￾ual compression of the renal parenchyma with suturing,
as can be done in open surgery. Hemorrhage is further
concerning as control can occupy valuable time during
which the renal unit is ischemic due to renal vascular
clamping during tumor excision. The surgeon is essen￾tially “on the clock” to unclamp the renal unit as soon
as possible to prevent acute tubular necrosis and further

loss of renal function. During this stressful situation, it
is imperative for the surgeon to have an organized
approach to management of hemorrhage, as delayed
management could lead to prolonged ischemic times,
iatrogenic positive surgical margins from inadequate
visualization, conversion to open surgery, or radical
nephrectomy.
Series on robotic partial nephrectomy report a reason￾able blood loss (Table 1). Nevertheless, the specific situa￾tion of “bleeding while clamped” is likely underreported.
Experts who publish their results may seamlessly manage
this issue without adverse events, and thereby avoid com￾plications in their published series. Thus, the existing lit￾erature does little to educate surgeons on how to deal
with bleeding during robotic partial nephrectomy while
clamped.
The goal of this manuscript is to educate robotic sur￾geons in factors to minimize hemorrhage during robotic
partial nephrectomy. We identified factors to consider
during review of preoperative imaging and renal hilar
exposure. We then developed a safety and management
checklist for “hemorrhage while clamped” during robotic
partial nephrectomy.
Methods
Robotic partial nephrectomy was initially reported in
2004 [19]. Since that time, the authors have performed a
total of over 1500 robotic partial nephrectomies. During
educational courses on robotic urological surgery from
2007 to 2010, it was noted that comments were made
regarding management of hemorrhage during robotic
partial nephrectomy. Suggestions for management were
made from audience members, experts, and other atten￾dees of the courses. However, starting in 2011, there
were no new suggestions or options, suggesting “satura￾tion” of management options. Based on these com￾ments, a safety checklist with the mentioned options for
managing hemorrhage was constructed for educational
purposes by two of the authors (KN and SB) and then
revised based on comments from the multi-institutional
group of authors.
Results
Preoperative imaging
Avoiding hemorrhage during robotic partial nephrectomy
begins with review of the preoperative imaging, which for
renal tumors typically includes CT or MRI with contrast.
The imaging should be reviewed carefully, in axial and
coronal planes, for the presence of accessory renal
arteries which may be identified in greater than 20% of
cases [20]. Accessory renal arteries become important
because if such an artery is not occluded during hilar
clamping, then substantial arterial bleeding can occur
during tumor resection. Tumor size and vicinity to renal
hilar vessels is also inspected on preoperative imaging, as
larger and more central tumors have an increased risk of
hemorrhage [21].
Renal hilar dissection and clamping
Prior to renal tumor dissection, the renal hilum (renal
artery and vein) is exposed. Surgical dissection should
proceed slowly to avoid inadvertent vascular injury and

blood loss during this portion of the procedure, and it is
useful to have vascular suture (i.e. 4-0 Prolene on an
RB-1 needle anchored with a LAPRA-TY clip) available
for vascular suturing if necessary to control venous
bleeding. An accessory renal artery is sometimes identi￾fied which was not visualized on preoperative imaging.
Further delineation of renal arterial anatomy (to identify
accessory renal arteries or confirm adequate clamping)
may be assisted by the use of a laparoscopic Doppler
ultrasound probe [22] or near infrared fluorescence of
intravenous indocyanine green [23]. Even in cases where
there is only one renal artery, the surgeon must be
mindful of clamping the renal artery after it has already
branched. If arterial clamping is performed too distally,
an unoccluded proximal renal artery branch supplying
the tumor itself can result in significant arterial bleeding
during resection.
In the case of tumors of increased complexity (hilar
tumors, endophytic, larger tumors), additional dissection
can be considered to improve hilar exposure. Additional
dissection to consider include: extra dissection of the
renal hilar vessels proximally and distally, ligation of the
gonadal vein to improve exposure, or dissection of the
adrenal gland away from the kidney. These measures
may improve hilar access if needed for subsequent
clamping with a laparoscopic Satinsky clamp or use of a
stapler if conversion to radical nephrectomy is required.
Once the hilar anatomy is delineated and the tumor is
exposed, the decision is then made on how to perform
hilar clamping. Available methods of hilar clamping
include assistant-placed laparoscopic vascular clamps,
robotic surgeon-placed clamps, or placement of a laparo￾scopic Satinsky clamp. The correct choice of clamp is
based primarily on surgeon preference. If the Satinsky
clamp is placed then an additional assistant port must be
placed and care must be taken to avoid a collision
between a robotic arm and the clamp, which could
potentially lead to avulsion of the hilum and significant
hemorrhage.
Following renal hilar and tumor exposure, a decision
is then made to clamp the artery alone or to clamp both
the artery and the vein. For small, exophytic renal
tumors, clamping of the artery alone is typically suffi￾cient. However, for tumors that are more endophytic,
the possibility of encountering a sizable venous branch
during excision is increased and therefore clamping of
the renal vein should also be considered.
Bleeding source during tumor resection: arterial versus
venous
All suggestions for intraoperative management of hemor￾rhage during robotic partial nephrectomy involved iden￾tification if the hemorrhage was arterial or venous in
origin, as management options differed depending on
this critical branch point. Several clues may help the sur￾geon identify whether the bleeding source is arterial or
venous. Arterial bleeding is pulsatile and typically of a
larger volume while venous bleeding may generally be
more of an ooze and of a lower volume. In additional to
the initial assessment of bleeding as arterial versus
venous, communication should also occur with anesthe￾sia to alert them to the possibility of hemodynamic
instability from hemorrhage so that appropriate support
with intravenous fluid and blood transfusion may be
given as needed.
Arterial bleeding
The arterial safety checklist (Figure 1) addresses man￾agement of arterial bleeding from the partial nephrect￾omy bed. Often more than one of these maneuvers may
be needed. Two suggestions involve adjunct measures,
which despite not directly controlling the arterial bleed￾ing may nonetheless help to decrease the amount of
hemorrhage and allow for the opportunity to identify
the arterial source of bleeding. First, if the patient is
hypertensive, then controlled reduction of blood pres￾sure by anesthesia may improve visualization. A second
temporizing option is to unclamp the renal vein. This
option at times may substantially improve visualization
by allowing venous outflow in the setting of continued
arterial inflow into the partial nephrectomy bed.
Further suggestions for the management of arterial
bleeding focus on methods to control the actual renal
arterial branch which is the source of the bleeding. These
include placement of an additional clamp for arterial con￾trol, either on the same artery if there is inadequate clamp
pressure or on an accessory artery if one is identified with
further dissection.
Even with the aforementioned efforts, arterial bleeding
may persist. If this bleeding persists at a manageable level,
then excision of the renal mass can continue expediently
with consideration of adjunct measures to control bleeding
such as tamponade of the bleeding (by placement of pres￾sure by the surgical assistant with suction device or other
instrument) or by placement of a suture at the resection
bed even if the mass has only been partially excised. Once
the mass is excised then further hemostatic measures can
be performed including cauterizing the base of the resec￾tion bed, suturing the resection bed, and placing sliding
clip renorrhaphy sutures [15] ultimately providing com￾pression of the parenchyma. However, if bleeding is not
manageable, then importantly, emergent open conversion
(for open partial nephrectomy or complete nephrectomy)
or robotic nephrectomy may be necessary.
Venous backbleeding
The management safety checklist of venous hemorrhage
(Figure 2) is generally technically easier to manage than

arterial bleeding. The insufflation pressure maintaining
the pneumoperitoneum can be increased up to 18 mm
Hg to improve visualization. This measure is typically
well tolerated by most patients, although anesthesia
should be informed of the need to monitor for increases
in end tidal carbon dioxide or difficulty with ventilation.
The theoretical increased risk of gas embolism with
increased pneumoperitoneum pressures has been
hypothesized [24], but the authors are not aware of the
actual occurrence [25].
In contrast to vein unclamping with arterial bleeding,
with venous bleeding an additional clamp can be placed
on the renal vein to decrease venous backbleeding.
Additionally, on the left side placement of the clamp on
the renal vein lateral to the gonadal and adrenal veins
may stop additional backbleeding from those branches.
In practice, the tumor can often be excised despite
venous hemorrhage which can subsequently be con￾trolled with suturing the tumor bed. Conversion to open
surgery for radical nephrectomy for venous bleeding
during minimally invasive partial nephrectomy is
uncommon [26,27].
Discussion
Hemorrhage during robotic partial nephrectomy is
probably underreported, as most series are reported by
high volume surgeons at tertiary care centers who may
not have major consequences from this bleeding. There￾fore, hemorrhage may not result in a formal complica￾tion if it is quickly and efficiently controlled.
Nevertheless, as hemorrhage may occur during critical
and often stressful portions of the operation, an array of
management options should be recognized by the sur￾geon performing the procedure. We present a compre￾hensive discussion of factors to consider regarding
hemorrhage during robotic partial nephrectomy. It is
our hope that review of these factors will educate other
surgeons in preparation for this experience, and thus
increases patient safety and surgeon confidence in deal￾ing with this difficult situation.

In practice, hemorrhage prevention may be more impor￾tant that hemorrhage management. Hemorrhage can be
prevented quite simply with accurate identification of all
arteries and veins, and use of adequately functioning vas￾cular clamps. Unfortunately, such a statement presumes
that the surgeon ability, radiographic imaging, and patient
anatomy are uniform, easily identified, and subject to no
variability. In “real world” situations, all of our high
volume experts have dealt with hemorrhage during partial
nephrectomy while clamped and thus have contributed to
the discussion of options.
The safety checklists present an array of options, how￾ever good clinical judgment remains paramount. For
example, a surgeon may not improve hemostasis by
implementing measures for venous hemorrhage in a
patient that actually has arterial hemorrhage instead.
Additionally, as the brisk bleeding with arterial hemor￾rhage can be difficult to manage and can result in rapid
patient instability, the decision to eventually convert to
an open procedure or radical nephrectomy to allow for
safe completion of the surgery is ultimately based on
sound clinical acumen which guides the surgeon
through their organized approach to such a scenario.
On an educational and safety level, knowledge of the
potential options for hemorrhage management may pre￾vent worsening of conditions, particularly amongst
lower volume surgeons. Although testing such safety
checklists is impossible, discussion of the management
of hemorrhage is important to disseminate in the litera￾ture in an effort to potentially improve patient safety.
Conclusions
Safely performing robotic partial nephrectomy is depen￾dent on attention to prevention of hemorrhage and
rapid response to the challenge of intraoperative bleed￾ing. Preparation is essential for maximizing the chance
of success during robotic partial nephrectomy.
