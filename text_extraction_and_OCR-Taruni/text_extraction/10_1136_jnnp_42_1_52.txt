Uraemic myoclonus: an example of reticular reflex
myoclonus?
D. CHADWICK AND A. T. FRENCH
From Whipps Cross Hospital, Leytonstone, London
S U M M A R Y Two patients are described who developed action, reflex myoclonus during acute
renal failure. In both cases the myoclonus was abolished after the intravenous administration of
clonazepam. We suggest that the characteristic action myoclonus, which occurs in both acute
renal failure and postanoxic encephalopathy, is caused by a disturbance of function in the lower
brainstem reticular formation.
A number of abnormal movements may occur in
patients with acute renal failure. These include
muscle fasciculation, asterixis, and myoclonus
(Locke et al., 1961; Tyler, 1968). There are, how￾ever, relatively few detailed clinical descriptions of
uraemic myoclonus. Our purpose in this short
communication is to describe the clinical
characteristics of myoclonus in two patients with
acute renal failure, and to report the dramatic
effect of clonazepam in suppressing the myoclonus.
These observations appear relevant to other recent
observations in patients with myoclonus of differ￾ent aetiologies (Chadwick et al., 1977), and may
further our understanding of the basic mechanisms
of some forms of myoclonus.
Case reports
CASE 1
A 69 year old man was admitted to hospital after
a brief episode of uncontrollable shaking of his
limbs without alteration of consciousness. For
three weeks he had had backache and dysuria,
which had been treated with cotrimoxazole and
benorylate without effect. He had not passed urine
for the 18 hours before admission.
For many years he had been hypertensive, ade￾quately controlled by hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg,
reserpine 62.5 jug, and potassium chloride 572 mg,
one tablet (Salupres) daily. Nineteen months pre￾viously, bladder carcinoma had been diagnosed at
cystoscopy, after an episode of haematuria. His￾Address for correspondence and reprint requests: Dr D. Chadwick,

Tyne.

tology showed a transitional cell papilloma with
infiltration of the lamina propria. This was treated
by transurethral resection, and three subsequent
cystoscopies had shown no evidence of recurrence.
The indices of renal function had been normal
until two months before admission, when plasma
urea was 10.1 mmol/l and creatinine 139 ptmol/l.
On admission he was obviously unwell, but
apyrexial. The jugular venous pressure was raised
30 mm above normal, and his blood pressure was
220/120 mmHg. There were no palpable ab￾dominal masses but per rectum there was a hard
fixed mass, proximal to the prostate, extending
bilaterally into the pelvis. He was fully conscious,
and orientated in time and space. There was no
asterixis, but he exhibited a variety of rapid, brief
involuntary movements. At rest there were fre￾quent, but irregular, fascicular muscular contrac￾tions. When these affected proximal muscles no
movement resulted, but when they involved distal
limb muscles, fine movements of fingers and toes
occurred. Any disturbance, however, precipitated
more gross muscle jerking, affecting either a
single limb or, more frequently, the head, trunk,
and all four limbs synchronously. Such myoclonus
was at times sufficiently violent to be a danger to
the patient and his attendants. A number of stimuli
were effective in precipitating such myoclonus. The
most potent of these was attempted voluntary
movement. Passive movement of a limb, eliciting
tendon reflexes, and rapid stretch stimuli applied
to the fingers, also resulted in myoclonus which
was sometimes restricted to the limb stimulated
but more often involved the whole body. Sudden
auditory stimuli evoked generalised myoclonus,
but tactile (without joint displacement) and photic
stimuli did not. There were no abnormal cranial

nerve signs. Muscle tone and power were normal,
but co-ordination was grossly impaired because of
myoclonus. Sensation was normal and tendon re￾flexes normally reactive. Plantar responses were
flexor.
At admission investigations showed a haemo￾globin of 13.3 g/dl, white cell count of 8.2X109/l,
and an ESR of 66 mm in the first hour. The plasma
urea was 34.6 mmol/l, creatinine 1188 ,umol/l,
sodium 144 mmol/l, potassium 5.8 mmol/l, chlo￾ride 109 mmol/l, and bicarbonate 15 mmol/l. Re￾sults of serum calcium and phosphate, blood sugar,
and liver function tests were all normal. The ECG
showed peaked T waves compatible with hyper￾kalaemia, and the chest radiograph showed upper
lobe blood diversion. A high dose intravenous
urogram demonstrated an enlarged right kidney
with dilated calyces. The left kidney was of normal
size but the calyces were not clearly visualised.
A diagnosis of acute obstructive renal failure
was made, and peritoneal dialysis started. His in￾voluntary movements ceased over 24 hours with the
fall in plasma urea and creatinine. Subsequent
cystoscopy showed the bladder to be oedematous
and deformed by a posterior mass. Exploratory
laparotomy revealed a tense right kidney and
retroperitoneal tumour invading the pelvis with
involvement of para-aortic lymph nodes. Histology
showed moderately differentiated transitional cell
carcinoma.
Dialysis was terminated, and over the subsequent
two days he developed an identical pattern of
involuntary movements to that described previ￾ously, as his blood urea rose from 16.9 to 25.3
mmol/l. He died three days after laparotomy.
Effect of clonazepam
On admission the patient's myoclonus was of such
violence as to make the insertion of a peritoneal
dialysing cannula impossible. However, a 1 mg
intravenous bolus of clonazepam abolished the
myoclonus, allowing insertion of the cannula under
local anaesthesia. Voluntary movement and pre￾viously effective sensory stimuli no longer evoked
myoclonus, although some small fascicular muscle
contractions were still present. When the myo￾clonus returned after stopping dialysis, there was
a similar response to further clonazepam intra￾venously. Intravenous saline in an equivalent vol￾ume was without effect. A single 1 mg bolus of
clonazepam relieved myoclonus for up to four
hours.
CASE 2
A 55 year old man, with no preceding relevant
medical history, was admitted to the intensive
therapy unit with a two week history of sore
throat, cough, malaise, and fever.
He was plethoric, hyperventilating, and had
multiple areas of skin infarction over the arms
and the legs. He was hypotensive (90/70 mmHg)
with a sinus tachycardia of 140/minute. There was
a long midsystolic murmur (grade 2/6) audible at
the left sternal edge but his chest was clinically
clear and his abdomen normal to palpation. He
was drowsy but orientated in time and space. There
was no neck stiffness, and his fundi were normal.
There were no localising neurological signs.
At admission his haemoglobin was 14.2 g/dl,
white cell count 14.1 X 109/l (82% neutrophils),
platelets 15 000X 109/l, and ESR 70 mm in the
first hour. Clotting factors were normal, as was a
CSF examination. The chest radiograph showed a
slightly increased cardiothoracic diameter, but was
otherwise unremarkable. A midstream specimen
of urine was sterile but contained 50-100 red cells/
pl. An initial blood culture yielded a growth of
Staphylococcus albus, but a throat swab produced
a heavy growth of 83-haemolytic (Lancefield Group
A) streptococci. Liver function tests and a bone
marrow examination were normal.
A diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis was made,
and treatment was started with intravenous benzyl
penicillin (4 g, four hourly), methicillin (1 g, four
hourly), and cephalothin (1 g, four hourly). How￾ever, his condition deteriorated, and he became
oliguric. On admission his plasma urea was 19.4
mmol/l, creatinine 244 ymol/l, sodium 126 mmol/
1, potassium 3.7 mmol/l, bicarbonate 15 mmol/l,
and chloride 92 mmol/l. Over three days his
plasma urea rose to 42 mmol/l and creatinine to
424 ,mol/l. At this time he developed myoclonus.
He was by then stuporose and confused. There
were no abnormal movements at rest, but any
voluntary movement precipitated myoclonus. It
could also be evoked by passive movement, stretch
stimuli applied to the fingers, and eliciting tendon
reflexes. There was no clinical myoclonic response
to auditory or photic stimuli. The myoclonus
usually involved both proximal and distal limb
muscles in the limb moved or stimulated. No
truncal myoclonus was seen, and only on rare
occasions did the response to movement or sensory
stimuli involve more than one limb.
The myoclonus persisted for 48 hours, except
when suppressed by clonazepam (see below). After
this, deteriorating renal and respiratory function
required peritoneal dialysis and intermittent posi￾tive pressure ventilation. He died 14 days after
admission. Postmortem examination confirmed the
presence of bacterial endocarditis with some Gram
positive cocci within vegetations on the mitral
valve. The brain and kidneys were macroscopically
normal.

Eflect of clonazepam
The administration of 0.75 mg of clonazepam as an
intravenous bolus abolished the myoclonus in the
patient from one minute to five hours after injec￾tion. Injection of diluent and an appropriate
amount of saline was without effect.
Discussion
The myoclonus which occurred in both these
patients with acute renal failure was clinically
similar to the action or intention myoclonus des￾cribed by Wolfhart and Hook (1951) and Lance
and Adams (1963) in syndromes of different
aetiology-that is, it was usually absent when the
patient was at rest, but was provoked by any
voluntary movement. Lance and Adams (1963)
also demonstrated that a variety of sensory stimuli
were capable of provoking a myoclonic response in
their patients with postanoxic encephalopathy.
Most potent of these were proprioceptive and sud￾den auditory stimuli. The same was true of these
uraemic patients.
Our understanding of the basic mechanisms of
such action myoclonus has been advanced by
recent physiological, pharmacological, and bio￾chemical observations in patients with postanoxic
myoclonus (Chadwick et al., 1977; Hallett et al.,
1977). It now seems possible to identify a group of
such patients in whom (a) myoclonus frequently
involves proximal limb and truncal muscles; (b)
the myoclonic response to peripheral propriore￾ceptive stimuli involves not only the distal muscles
of the limb to which the stimulus is applied, but
also proximal muscles of that limb and often the
muscles of other limbs; (c) the EEG shows spike
or polyspike and slow wave activity which bears a
variable temporal relationship to the muscle action
potential associated with the myoclonic jerk; (d)
the cortical somatosensory evoked responses to
electrical stimulation of the median nerves are not
enlarged; (e) during a generalised myoclonic jerk;
brainstem nuclei appear to be activated in an
ascending order; and (f) the myoclonus is alleviated
dramatically by the administration of either sero￾tonin precursors or clonazepam. In such patients
the myoclonus may be mediated by a spinobulbar￾spinal reflex, which, under normal circumstances,
is inhibited by serotonergic neural systems (Chad￾wick et al., 1977). The term "reticular-reflex myo￾clonus" has been used to describe this phenonemon
(Hallett et al., 1977).
There appear to be several similarities between
reticular reflex, postanoxic myoclonus, and the
myoclonus in these uraemic patients. In the latter,
proximal muscle groups were frequently involved
in the myoclonic response to voluntary movement,
and sensory stimuli could evoke a generalised
myoclonic response in one case. We were unable
to make electrophysiological observations on our
patients but Tyler (1968) described paroxysmal
slow wave, and spike and slow wave activity occur￾ring in the EEG of uraemic patients. He does not,
however, comment on its relationship to myo￾clonus. While we know of no data on the effect of
renal failure on the somatosensory evoked re￾sponse, or the direction of activation of brainstem
structures in uraemic myoclonus, clonazepam is
dramatically effective in suppressing both uraemic
and reticular reflex, postanoxic myoclonus (Chad￾wick et al., 1977).
Further study is necessary before firm conclu￾sions can be drawn, but it seems probable that
both uraemia and anoxia cause myoclonus medi￾ated by similar mechanisms. Indirect evidence
from electrophysiological studies in postanoxic
patients suggests that the lower brainstem reticular
formation is actively involved (Hallet et al., 1977).
However, no animal model of postanoxic myo￾clonus exists, and this makes direct testing of this
hypothesis impossible. It is, therefore, of interest
that infusions of urea cause myoclonus in cats.
Zuckerman and Glaser (1972) noted that, during
the continuous infusion of urea, cats initially de￾veloped asynchronous fascicular muscle twitching,
which gradually increased in magnitude, tended to
become synchronised, and merged into clear-cut
localised myoclonic jerks. Loud noises, proprio￾ceptive stimuli, and voluntary movement evoked
generalised myoclonus. The myoclonus in this
model thus appears identical to that occurring in
the clinical setting. Detailed electrophysiological
studies in the cat showed that supramesencephalic
structures were not involved in the production of
the myoclonus which appeared to be related to
paroxysmal activity in the lower brainstem re￾ticular formation, in particular in the nucleus
gigantocellularis. This depended to a large extent
on a sensory input, as cervical cord section and
curarisation both reduced, but did not completely
abolish, the paroxysmal activity during urea
infusion.
We would, therefore, suggest that the character￾istic action myoclonus, which occurs in both acute
renal failure and postanoxic encephalopathy is
caused by disturbance of function in the lower
brainstem reticular formation. This results in the
abnormal reflex responses to sensory stimuli which
constitute this form of myoclonus.
