Background and Objectives
There are no widely accepted criteria for the definition of hematopoietic stem cell
transplant -associated microangiopathy (TAM). An International Working Group was
formed to develop a consensus formulation of criteria for diagnosing clinically signif￾icant TAM.
Design and Methods
The participants proposed a list of candidate criteria, selected those considered nec￾essary, and ranked those considered optional to identify a core set of criteria. Three
obligatory criteria and four optional criteria that ranked highest formed a core set. In
an appropriateness panel process, the participants scored the diagnosis of 16
patient profiles as appropriate or not appropriate for TAM. Using the experts’ ratings
on the patient profiles as a gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity of 24 candi￾date definitions of the disorder developed from the core set of criteria were evaluat￾ed. A nominal group technique was used to facilitate consensus formation. The defi￾nition of TAM with the highest score formed the final proposal.
Results
The Working Group proposes that the diagnosis of TAM requires fulfilment of all of
the following criteria: (i) >4% schistocytes in blood; (ii) de novo, prolonged or progres￾sive thrombocytopenia (platelet count <50x109
/L or 50% or greater reduction from
previous counts); (iii) sudden and persistent increase in lactate dehydrogenase con￾centration; (iv) decrease in hemoglobin concentration or increased transfusion
requirement; and (v) decrease in serum haptoglobin. The sensitivity and specificity of
this definition exceed 80%.
Interpretation and Conclusions
The Working Group recommends that the presented criteria of TAM be adopted in clin￾ical use, especially in scientific trials.
Key words: bone marrow transplantation, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,
thrombotic microangiopathy, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura,
transplant-associated microangiopathy.

Decision Making and Problem Solving
ABSTRACT

| 96 | haematologica/the hematology journal | 2007; 92(01)
Microangiopathy following hematopoietic stem
cell transplantation, particularly allogeneic
transplantation, is a well recognized but poor￾ly defined syndrome. A number of terms have been used
to describe this entity, including thrombotic thrombocy￾topenic purpura (TTP), hemolytic uremic syndrome
(HUS), TTP-HUS, thrombotic microangiopathy, trans￾plant-associated microangiopathy (TAM), and microan￾giopathic hemolytic anemia. The pathogenesis is not
well understood; endothelial toxicity caused by chemo￾radiotherapy, infections, immunosuppressive drugs, and
graft-versus-host disease have been thought to play a
role.
1-3 In published reports, an association has been vari￾ably found between this disorder and female sex,
4-6,8 an
unrelated donor,
5,7-9 presence of graft-versus-host dis￾ease,
1,4,6,8,9 fungal or viral infections,
8,9 and administration
of cyclosporine A1 or sirolimus.
10 The onset of TAM usu￾ally occurs within 150 days post-transplantation.
4,5,11
Despite some features in common, TAM differs from de
novo TTP in many aspects including the absence of
severe ADAMTS13 deficiency, a different spectrum of
clinical symptoms, poor response to plasmapheresis,
and the lack of evidence of systemic microthrombus for￾mation.
12
Minor laboratory findings suggestive of microan￾giopathy are seen in a large proportion of allogeneic
transplant recipients.
1,13-15 The reported proportions of
patients developing a clinically significant microan￾giopathy syndrome have varied greatly. Recently
George and co-workers12 presented a review of pub￾lished reports on microangiopathy following allogeneic
stem cell transplantation. Twenty-eight different defini￾tions of this syndrome had been used in the 35 reviewed
reports. Nineteen different parameters had been used as
criteria, many of them indicating the same factors
phrased differently. The most commonly used criteria
were red cell fragmentation, increased lactate dehydro￾genase (LDH) concentration, a decrease in platelet count
or increased platelet transfusion requirement, renal fail￾ure, decreased hemoglobin level or increased red blood
cell transfusion requirement, a neurological abnormality,
the absence of disseminated intravascular coagulation,
and a negative direct antiglobulin test. Reflecting the dif￾ferent definitions, the incidence of post-transplant
microangiopathy varied in the reports from 0.5 to
63.6%, the median frequency of diagnosis being 7.9%.
The mortality in the different series ranged from 0 to
100 %; the overall mortality rate was 61%. Of the
deceased patients, 82% died within 3 months.
The lack of accepted standard criteria and the marked
heterogeneity in the definitions used largely prevent
meaningful comparisons of the published reports. For clin￾ical studies, particularly those aiming at the development
of prevention and treatment of TAM, a widely accepted
definition of this complication would be highly desirable.
On an initiative of the European Group for Blood and
Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) and the European
LeukemiaNet, an International Working Group was
formed with the intention to produce, by a consensus
process, a proposed definition of the clinical syndrome of
transplant-associated microangiopathy. The purpose was
to identify rigorous, consistent, and feasible criteria appli￾cable both to future clinical trials and also to routine prac￾tice.
Design and Methods
The diagnostic criteria for TAM were developed by a
multistep process, based on the approach of the American
College of Physicians16 with some modifications. This
process is described below and summarized in Figure 1.
An Expert Panel, constituted in September 2004, was
composed of 14 experts in microangiopathic disorders
and/or clinical stem cell transplantation (members of the
Working Group) and was chaired by a clinician with
expertise in clinical epidemiology (GB). After the initial
meetings, the Expert Panel agreed on the aim of the proj￾ect to develop diagnostic criteria for clinically significant
TAM.
Development of a core set of criteria for the
diagnosis of TAM
A questionnaire was mailed to each member of the
Expert Panel asking them to propose candidate diagnostic
criteria, and these criteria were further refined in a Delphi
process17 with a second questionnaire that asked the pan￾elists to rank the top choices among the candidate criteria.
An other category was provided for criteria not included in

the preliminary list. All the questionnaires were returned,
and the candidate criteria were ranked according to their
priority votes, with the 12 criteria that ranked highest
forming the preliminary core set of criteria. A third ques￾tionnaire was mailed to each Panel member asking them
to select the necessary criteria, defined as criteria that must
be present and the presence of which must be ascertained
in order to define patients as having TAM. All the ques￾tionnaires were returned, three necessary criteria were
identified (>80 % consensus) and the other candidate cri￾teria were ranked according to their priority votes. The
three necessary criteria and the four optional criteria that
ranked highest formed the core set of criteria.
Development of candidate diagnostic definitions
Using a mail-only system, we performed an appropri￾ateness panel process in order to develop candidate
diagnostic definitions of TAM. The overall goal of the
process was to decide upon the definition of the disor￾der based on the core set of criteria, using a combination
of statistical and consensus formation techniques.
18 In
order to achieve this, the co-ordinator of the project
generated 16 constructed patient profiles based on the
core set of diagnostic criteria. The profiles listed the
findings of the patients for each criterion of the core set.
The participants were asked to rate each of the profiles
as appropriate or not appropriate for the diagnosis of TAM
based on the individual physician’s clinical judgement.
If an 80% consensus about whether a constructed
patient’s profile did or did not have TAM was not
achieved, the case with the comments from the pan￾elists was redistributed to the panelists, and a second
vote was taken. If an 80% consensus was still not
attained, the patient’s profile was declared uninter￾pretable and was not considered further.
By using combinations of the variables in the core set,
24 sound candidate definitions of TAM were generated
for testing. The candidate definitions required the pres￾ence of the three necessary criteria and one to four
optional criteria.
Evaluation of the performance characteristics of the
candidate diagnostic definitions
The 16 profiles were then used to test the candidate
diagnostic definitions for their ability to classify individ￾ual patients as having or not having TAM, using the
physicians’ consensus in the rating of the constructed
patient profiles as a gold standard. The agreement
between the decision based on the criteria and the con￾sensus of the physicians was assessed. Only the patient
profiles for which a physician consensus was achieved
were used. For each definition, we calculated the sensi￾tivity (ability of the definition to identify a patient as
having TAM when he/she had been classified as having
TAM by the physicians), the specificity (ability of the
definition to identify a patient as not having TAM
when he/she had been classified as not having TAM by
the physicians), the rate of false-positivity ([number of
patients falsely identified as having TAM by the given
criteria divided by all patients identified as having
TAM×100), and the rate of false-negativity ([number of
patients falsely identified as not having TAM by the
given criteria divided by all patients identified as not
having TAM] ×100). We used the kappa statistic19 as an
additional measure of agreement between the evalua￾tion made by the physicians and the definitions: κ val￾ues ≥0.7 were considered to be evidence of agreement.
At a final consensus questionnaire, the Panel ranked
the top three candidate definitions based on face validi￾ty and content validity, and the definition that obtained
the highest ranking was selected as the first choice.
Results
The Expert Panel listed 27 criteria (15 positive, i.e. the
presence of which indicates TAM, and 12 negative, i.e.
the presence of which excludes TAM), to be included as
candidate criteria for the diagnosis of TAM (Table 1).
The three criteria with the highest preference rate
(>80% consensus) as being necessary for the diagnosis
were: (i) increased percentage (>4%) of schistocytes in

peripheral blood; (ii) de novo, prolonged or progressive
thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than 50×109
/L or
a 50 % or greater decrease from previous counts); and
(iii) sudden and persistent increase in LDH. These crite￾ria were regarded as necessary. When the other criteria
were ranked according to their priority score, the four
with the highest rank for the core set were the follow￾ing: (i) a decrease of hemoglobin concentration or
increased red cell transfusion need; (ii) a sudden and per￾sistent increase in BUN or creatinine; (iii) neurologic
abnormalities; (iv) decreased haptoglobin.
Using the appropriateness panel process, the 14 Panel
members scored eight of the 16 patients’ profiles as hav￾ing TAM, and eight as not having TAM. Three of the 24
definitions of TAM showed a sensitivity >80%. These
three definitions, their corresponding sensitivity and
specificity and false-positive and false-negative rates are
shown in Table 2. Face validity, i.e. a subjective judg￾ment of clinical appropriateness, and content validity,
i.e. a subjective judgment of the relevance of the defini￾tion, were analyzed and discussed by the Panel. Taking
into account the statistical performance of the definition
and the validity judgments, the final definition of TAM
was as follows (Table 3): all of the following present: (i)
increased percentage (>4%) of schistocytes in peripher￾al blood; (ii) de novo, prolonged or progressive thrombo￾cytopenia (platelet count less than 50×109
/L or a 50% or
greater decrease from previous counts); (iii) sudden and
persistent increase in LDH; (iv) a decrease in hemoglo￾bin or increased red blood cell transfusion requirement,
and (v) a decrease in serum haptoglobin.
Discussion
In this work we report the results of a consensus
process on the diagnostic definition of TAM. In the
absence of a specific biological marker for the disorder,
we were aware that searching for a definition of TAM
raised both a true diagnostic issue, i.e. what are the
diagnostic criteria and how to use them for the diagno￾sis, and a classificatory one, i.e. how to distinguish this
disorder among a spectrum of disorders with similar
features. To focus the problem, the Working Group
stated that the aim of this project was to arrive at a def￾inition of clinically significant TAM to be primarily
used in clinical trials. The task of finding a consensus
for diagnostic criteria was complicated by the fact that
the area is characterized by reports which do not deal
with prospective clinical trials, and few ad hoc studies
report the statistical information needed for summing
up the evidence. The conceptual framework of this
project was an assumption that acknowledged experts
have an implicit and comprehensive mastery of the sci￾entific and practical information that would yield the
most appropriate definition. The value of this type of
consensus approach to the definition of operational cri￾teria in medicine has been exploited in many similar
processes.
20,21
Using consensus formation and a statistical approach,
the results of this project suggest that TAM can be
defined with five criteria: increased percentage of schis￾tocytes, thrombocytopenia, increased LDH, a decrease
in hemoglobin concentration or increased transfusion
requirement, and a decrease in serum haptoglobin, as
specified in Table 3. This definition is constructed from
criteria widely used in different definitions of post￾Table 2. Final results for the three best definitions of TAM. Each
definition consists of three necessary criteria and, in addition,
other criteria as indicated.

Diagnostic criteria for TAM
transplant microangiopathy, but not in this precise com￾bination. The results of this work were derived from a
structured consensus process and a statistical analysis of
the reactions of the experts to 16 constructed patient
profiles. The characteristics of the resulting definition of
the disorder, i.e. its specificity and sensitivity, should be
interpreted as a result of uncertainty inherent both to
the consensus process and the idea the panelists had of
the disorder. The former depends on the size of the
expert panel and the number of cases used during the
consensus process; the latter reflects the absence of clear
markers for defining the disorder. The resulting defini￾tion had a 100% specificity and a 100% sensitivity, thus
producing no false positive and no false negative defini￾tions. Therefore these criteria seem to be appropriate
when used for enrolling patients into clinical trials.
The Working Group chose to use the term transplant￾associated microangiopathy for the disorder. This is a
descriptive term not referring to the pathogenesis which
is unclear and probably heterogeneous. The Working
Group wanted to avoid the word thrombotic, as systemic
microthrombus formation has not been shown to play
an essential role in this complication, contrary to de novo
TTP.
12 This terminology may also be helpful in pointing
out the difference in the utility of plasmapheresis in the
treatment of TTP and TAM.
The present criteria for TAM were developed for
practical clinical purposes, especially for clinical trials,
and the definition has limitations. It does not take into
account the etiology of the microangiopathic process.
The definition has not been prospectively validated in
patients; this remains to be done in future trials. The cri￾teria are not independent from each other, they are
essentially different markers of microangiopathic
hemolytic anemia and, in addition, consumption
thrombocytopenia. However, as allogeneic transplant
patients often have multiple problems that may affect
one or more of the individual criteria, the presented
combination of criteria confirms the microangiopathic
red cell destruction. The defined level for the proportion
of schistocytes is only an estimate, and it cannot be con￾cluded that patients with a somewhat lower or higher
schistocyte level would have a different outcome.
Nevertheless, in the present state of great heterogeneity
in the definitions used, a consensus definition by a rela￾tively large group of experts is of value in an effort to
standardize the definition of TAM for clinical trials.
The treatment of TAM is problematic, and no consis￾tently effective therapies are available. The subject was
recently reviewed by George et al.
12 On purpose, this
consensus panel did not address the topic of treatment.
During the present consensus process the Toxicity
Committee of the Blood and Marrow Transplant
Clinical Trials Network published a consensus summa￾ry of thrombotic microangiopathy after hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation.
22 They presented a consensus
definition for this complication which differs markedly
from the present proposal. Their definition included the
presence of schistocytes, increased LDH level, concur￾rent renal and/or neurological dysfunction, and a nega￾tive Coombs’ test. They did not include thrombocy￾topenia among the criteria because transplant recipients
often have low platelet counts from various causes dur￾ing the early post-transplantation period. The present
Expert Panel concluded that although the causes of
thrombocytopenia may be variable in this group of
patients, low or decreasing platelet counts are an essen￾tial feature of TAM, and a patient with a stable normal
platelet count would be unlikely to have TAM. De novo,
prolonged or progressive thrombocytopenia ranked sec￾ond highest as a criterion for TAM in the consensus
process. Nephropathy and neurological abnormalities
were among the highest ranked optional criteria but
they did not qualify for the final set of criteria. Renal
problems are very common in allogeneic transplant
recipients but the causes are manifold, including the
effects of cyclosporine, and a proportion of patients
with TAM do not have nephropathy.
4,5 Neurological
abnormalities are a less prominent feature in TAM than
in de novo TTP.
4,5 The Expert Panel also considered the
role of exclusion criteria such as a positive Coombs’ test
and the presence of signs of disseminated intravascular
coagulation but their ranking in the consensus process
did not indicate their inclusion in the final set of criteria.
In conclusion, the Working Group proposes that the
presented criteria for transplant-associated microan￾giopathy, which were developed using an American
College of Physicians-based consensus process and offer
a definition with more than >80% sensitivity and speci￾ficity, be adopted for clinical use, especially for scientif￾ic trials.
