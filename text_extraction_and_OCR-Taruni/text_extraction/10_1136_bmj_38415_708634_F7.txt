Voluntary surveillance systems are subject to
under-reporting. Figures may underestimate true
numbers. Miscategorisation of probable country of
infection by presuming the country with the highest
prevalence as the likely country of infection will under￾estimate the number of infections acquired in the
United Kingdom, particularly among people originat￾ing from countries with high prevalence. New HIV
diagnoses do not represent new HIV infections, as
diagnosis can occur at any point between infection and
death, which in the natural course of infection is
typically 10-12 years. Furthermore, surveillance
reports do not distinguish between partners infected in
high prevalence countries while visiting and partners
infected before migrating from those countries.
The number of people becoming infected with
HIV through heterosexual intercourse in the United
Kingdom is rising steadily. As the number of
heterosexuals living with HIV (diagnosed and undiag￾nosed) in the United Kingdom grows, the likelihood of
heterosexual transmission within the country will
increase, particularly among ethnic minorities.

voluntary HIV/AIDS reporting system in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland is gratefully acknowledged, as is the help,

Metformin and reduced risk of cancer in diabetic patients
Josie M M Evans, Louise A Donnelly, Alistair M Emslie-Smith, Dario R Alessi, Andrew D Morris
Metformin, widely given to patients with type 2 diabetes,
works by targeting the enzyme AMPK (AMP activated
protein kinase), which induces muscles to take up glucose
from the blood. A recent breakthrough has found the
upstream regulator of AMPK to be a protein kinase
known as LKB1.1 2 LKB1 is a well recognised tumour
suppressor. Activation of AMPK by metformin and
exercise requires LKB1, and this would also explain why
exercise is beneficial in the primary and secondary
prevention of certain cancers.3 We hypothesise that
metformin use in patients with type 2 diabetes may
reduce their risk of cancer.
Participants, methods, and results
We tested this hypothesis using record linkage databases
developed in Tayside, Scotland: a diabetes clinical
information system (DARTS) and a database of
dispensed prescriptions (MEMO).4 We did a pilot
case-control study using previously validated methods.5
From 314 127 people who were resident (or died) in
Tayside in 1993-2001, 11 876 had been newly diagnosed
with type 2 diabetes. Of these, 923 were subsequently
admitted to hospital with an ICD-9 or ICD-10
(international classification of diseases, 9th or 10th
revision) diagnostic code for malignant cancer in study
period (for which first admission occurred at least one year
after diagnosis of diabetes). The index date of these cases
was the date of first admission. We generated random
controls from the diabetic population (two for each case);
patients without cancer matched for age, year of diagnosis,
and sex, and we gave them matching index dates.
We collated information about use of metformin for
all cases and controls and calculated unadjusted odds
ratios using conditional logistic regression (taking
matching into account). The proportions of cases and
controls for whom confounding data were available were
smoking 73%, body mass index 62%, blood pressure
67%, and postcode rank for material deprivation 99%.
We categorised continuous variables into quartile groups,
with missing values forming a separate category. We
adjusted odds ratios for these possible confounders.
More than half of the patients with cancer (488; 53%)
were men. Mean age was 73 (standard deviation 9.8)
years and mean duration of diabetes was 8.5 (6.4) years.
More than a third (336; 36.4%) of the cases had been
given at least one prescription for metformin in the year
before their index date compared with 732 (39.7%) of the
controls. The unadjusted odds ratio was 0.86 (95%

confidence interval 0.73 to 1.02). The unadjusted odds
ratio for any exposure to metformin since 1993 was 0.79
(0.67 to 0.93).
We also investigated total duration of exposure (time
between first and last metformin prescription), total
number of prescriptions, and total amount of metformin
dispensed since January 1993 (table). Adjustment did not
greatly affect the risk estimates, indicating no substantial
confounding effects.
Comment
Taking metformin may be associated with reduced risk of
cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes, and a biologically
plausible mechanism exists. Of particular interest is the
suggestion of a dose-response relationship (table).
The strengths of the study were its population based
sampling, the objective method used to define metformin
exposure, detailed dispensed prescribing histories
available for patients, and adjustment for confounders.
Because this is a pilot observational study, however, we
must consider alternative explanations. We used a crudely
defined case series of cancer patients. The index date
used for the cases was their date of first admission to
hospital for cancer. If cases’ actual dates of diagnosis of
cancer were much earlier, this could affect clinicians’
prescribing.
We are planning a large cohort study linked to a
cancer registration database. We will identify a more
tightly defined case series of specific cancers, with more
precise dates of diagnosis, to explore this further.
We thank the DARTS Steering Group for their support. We also
thank the support staff of the DARTS/MEMO collaboration,
who facilitated this work.

One hundred years ago
The spitting nuisance
The police authorities of New York appear now to be thoroughly
in earnest in carrying out the municipal enactments forbidding
expectoration in public places. Quite recently ten well-dressed
men were fined two dollars each for spitting in one of the subway
stations. Persons who do not happen to have sufficient money
about them to pay the fine are sent to gaol, a procedure which of
itself is likely to have a wholesome educative influence on the
public mind. The wardens of some of the police court prisons say
they have more public spitters in their custody than any other
class of offender. In some courts the average number of charges
of this kind dealt with daily is about half a dozen. When will our
own civil authorities follow the excellent example of New York,
and instead of leaving it to the discretion of omnibus and railway
companies to put up notices mildly deprecating expectoration, set
themselves resolutely to put down the disgusting and noxious
practice? (BMJ 1905;i:205a)
