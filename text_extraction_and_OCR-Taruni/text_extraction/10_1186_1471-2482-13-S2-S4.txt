Abstract
Background: In chronic hemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism, pathological modifications of
bone and mineral metabolism increase the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Parathyroidectomy,
reducing the incidence of cardiovascular events, may improve outcomes; however, its effects on long-term survival
are still subject of active research.
We compared, in hemodialysis patients, the results of parathyroidectomy, in terms of cardiovascular outcomes and
mortality, with those present in patients following medical treatment only, prior to the diffusion of calcimimetics.
Methods: From January 2004 to December 2006, 30 hemodialysis patients, affected by severe and unresponsive
secondary hyperparathyroidism, underwent parathyroidectomy - 15 total parathyroidectomy and 15 total
parathyroidectomy + subcutaneous autoimplantation. During a 5-year follow-up, patients did not receive a renal
transplantation and were evaluated for biochemical modifications and major cardiovascular events - death,
cardiovascular accidents, myocardial infarction and peripheral vascular disease. Results were compared with those
obtained in a control group of 20 hemodialysis patients, affected by secondary hyperparathyroidism, and refusing
surgical treatment, and following medical treatment only.
Results: The groups were comparable in terms of age, gender, dialysis vintage, and comorbidities. Postoperative
cardiovascular events were observed in 18/30 - 54% - surgical patients and in 4/20 - 20%- medical patients, with a
mortality rate respectively of 23.3% in the surgical group vs. 15% in the control group. Parathyroidectomy was not
associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular morbidity and survival rate was unaffected by surgical treatment.
Conclusions: In secondary hyperparathyroidism hemodialysis patients affected by severe cardiovascular disease,
surgery did not modify cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates. Therefore, in secondary hyperparathyroidism
hemodialysis patients, resistant to medical treatment, only an early indication to calcimimetics, or surgery, in the

Further studies will be useful to clarify the role of secondary hyperparathyroidism in determining unfavorable
cardiovascular outcomes and mortality in hemodialysis population.
Introduction
Incidence of secondary hyperparathyroidism (2HPT) in
the setting of chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disor￾der (CKD-MBD), increases with dialysis vintage, and, prior
to the calcimimetic era, parathyroidectomy (PTx) became
necessary in 15% of cases after 10 years, which rose to 38%
after 20 years [1]. According to PA Decker et al., an inter￾vention was required in 2.5% of dialysis patients a year [2].
From the analysis of medical treatment results, it emerged
that only about half of the patients were controlled in
terms of serum calcium (Ca), serum phosphate (P), Ca × P
product and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH)[3].
Recently, calcimimetics, well tolerated allosteric modula￾tors of the calcium-sensing receptor, inhibiting glandular
hyperplasia and significantly reducing circulating iPTH
levels without exacerbating hyperphosphatemia or hyper￾calcemia, have been shown to exert a major beneficial
impact on 2HTP management. They determine a reduc￾tion of fractures, hospitalizations and of PTxs in CKD￾MBD population [4,5]. However, R Narayan et al. reported
that PTx is more cost effective than cinacalcet in the
majority of patients, with the exception of those who are
either at high mortality risk, or those who would expect to
receive a kidney transplantation in the near future [6].
2HPT has a negative effect on quality of life under many
respects, and induces a higher mortality rate, particularly
due to the onset of premature cardiovascular complica￾tions, which is associated with vascular calcifications and
hypertension. In addition, anemia, at times resistant to
erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, becomes a risk factor
for unfavorable cardiovascular outcomes [7,8]. The risk for
cardiovascular events is increased by 10- to 30-fold among
HD patients compared with the general population [9]. It
has been demonstrated that at PTH levels > 495 pg/ml
there is a 25% increased risk of mortality [10], and
the response to vitamin D is reduced by 50% at PTH >
750 pg/ml [11]. Therefore, early surgery could offer an
improved quality of life and possibly a higher long-term
survival rate. KDIGO parameters modified the National
Kidney Foundation (NKF) guidelines [12], by referring to
local normal laboratory ranges for Ca, phosphorus and
PTH levels, which should be between 2 and 9 times the
normal range [13]. Successful surgical treatment often
results in a dramatic reduction of iPTH levels, relieving
the patient from clinical symptoms [14-17], and different
papers showed that PTX could also improve mortality and
cardiovascular morbidity [18-23].
With the aim to analyze this issue, we tested the impact
of surgery on cardiovascular outcomes and survival in 50
2HPT HD patients, after long-term follow-up. Pre and
postoperative cardiovascular status and postoperative out￾comes were evaluated in 30 patients submitted to PTx and
compared to 20 HD patients refusing surgery. In both
populations, calcimimetics were not utilized, and indica￾tions to surgical procedure were set according to both
K/DOQI 2003 guidelines and Y Tominaga et al. [12,17].
Materials and methods
Study design
A retrospective cohort study, in a group of 50 HD patients
with severe 2 HPT, unresponsive to medical treatment,
selected for PTx, and addressed to our Institution from
regional HD centers, was performed. Renal transplantation
was considered criteria of exclusion. iPTH levels > 53-84,
8 pmol/L, serum P level > 2,09 mmol/l, US enlarged para￾thyroid glands (> 1 cm or >500 mm3
) and persisting clini￾cal symptoms, six months after medical therapy, were
considered the main criteria for PTx. 30 patients accepted
to undergo surgical treatment (surgical group) and
20 patients, refusing surgery, were considered as medical
control group. 4 parathyroid glands at least were removed
in every case eligible for the study. Cardiovascular disease
was defined as presence of hypertension, peripheral artery
disease, electrocardiogram (ECG) signs of cardiac hyper￾trophy, ultrasound (US) cardiac valves calcification, ven￾tricular hypertrophy, arrhythmia, and coronary or
cerebrovascular disease. According to P Raggi et al. [24],
US valvular calcification was considered as the hallmark of
arterial wall calcification in identifying patients affected by
severe cardiovascular disease, and an unfavorable prognos￾tic factor, linked to a higher mortality risk. Anemia was
evaluated according to the Royal College of Physicians
(UK) National Clinical Guideline Centre [25]. During
60 months follow-up, cardiovascular outcomes and survi￾val were evaluated. Mortality data were available trough
December 2011. Major cardiovascular events - heart fail￾ure, myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease and
stroke - were the primary end-points, while death was the
second end-point.
Surgical group
Data were retrospectively collected from 30 consecutive
patients (11♂ and 19 ♀), affected by 2HPT of CKD, on
standard three-weekly HD, and submitted to PTx

between January 2004 and January 2006. All patients
gave informed consent to participate in the study.
Preoperative medical treatment consisted in phosphate
chelators (Ca carbonate, sevelamer, lanthanum carbo￾nate), dialysis baths with various Ca concentrations, vita￾min D and its analogues. Antihypertensive drugs were
used in 22/30 patients (73.3%). The erythropoiesis sti￾mulating agents (ESA) treatment regimen consisted in
three-weekly recombinant human ESA (alpha-erythro￾poietin) injections - 5.200 ± 3824.48 IU, in 29/30
patients. 1/30 patients were treated with alpha darbo￾poetin 30 (30 μg/every 15 days). Ptx was considered suc￾cessful when postoperative iPTH level was < 26.52
pmol/L. The 1.06-6.89 pmol/L range was taken as
reference of normal iPTH level based on which eu-
(1.06-6.89), hypo- (< 1.06), aparathyroidism (0) and per￾sistence or relapse (> 6.89) of disease were determined.
Hypocalcemia was considered to be present when serum
calcium was <1.99 mmol/L (normal value = 2.09-
2.54 mmol/L). High-resolution neck ultrasonography,
ear, nose and throat (ENT) examination, technetium￾99m-sestamibi scintigraphy of the neck and mediasti￾num, were the main preoperative diagnostic procedures.
12-lead ECG and epiaortic 2-dimensional and color
doppler transthoracic echocardiogram, by experienced
in-center cardiologists, and peripheral artery color dop￾pler ultrasonography examination were pre and post￾operatively performed. Cardiac valves calcification was
evaluated according to Wong [26]. iPTH, Ca, P, alkaline
phosphatase (ALP) and FT3, FT4, TSH, thyroglobulin
were measured along with fine needle biopsy of the
thyroid nodules; all blood samples were obtained before
dialysis. The Liaison®NTact®PTH Assay (DiaSorin Inc￾Stillwater, MN, USA), based on chemiluminescence
immunoassay (CLIA), was used for the quantitative
determination of iPTH (Coefficient of variation: CV%
intra assay 1.7-3.7; CV% inter assay 2.6-5.9; limit of
detection 0.07 pmol/L). Indications to surgical proce￾dure were set according to both K/DOQI 2003 guide￾lines and Y Tominaga et al. [12,17]. Regarding the
surgical procedures, 15 patients underwent total para￾thyroidectomy (TP) and another 15, awaiting renal
transplantation, underwent total parathyroidectomy with
autotransplantation (TPai) of 9-15 fragments of non￾nodular glandular tissue, in 3 subcutaneous pockets of
the non-dominant forearm. In 12 out of 30 patients
(40%) with thyroid gland disease, 8 total thyroidectomy
and 4 hemithyroidectomy procedures were performed.
In all cases, 4 at least parathyroid glands were removed
(the nature of the tissue was confirmed via intraopera￾tive histological examination). Only in a few cases, a HD
treatment was required immediately after surgery, due
to an electrolyte imbalance. The majority of patients
required intravenous administration of calcium, due to
postoperative hypocalcemia. Patients who underwent
autoimplantation completed long-term follow-up moni￾toring of iPTH from the implantation site and from the
contralateral arm, in order to evaluate gradients.
Medical group
During the same years, 20 patients, (8♂ and 12 ♀), eval￾uated by a similar preoperative work-up, in which com￾parable laboratory and clinical criteria for PTx were
present (aggressive 2HPT unresponsive to medical ther￾apy), refused surgery for various reasons and were con￾servatively managed. Medical treatment consisted in
phosphate chelators with sevelamer hydrochloride 3200-
4000 mg ±1000 in 10/20 (50%) of patients, Vitamin D
in 10/20, (50%). Aluminum salts were used in 1 patient
and finally calcium carbonate was used in 10 patients.
Patients were on three-weekly recombinant human ESA
(alpha erythropoietin) injection, 6000 UI in 10/20
patients; 5/20 patients were treated with alpha darbo￾poietin 60 mcg every week, and 5 with darbopoietin
80 mcg every 15 days. Antihypertensives were used in
60% of patients. Every occurrence of a major cardiovas￾cular event and death was evaluated during a 60 months
follow-up.
Statistics
Data were reported as the mean ± standard error of the
mean (SEM). A paired t Student test was performed.
The log-rank Mantel-Cox test and the Gehan-Breslow￾Wilcoxon test were used to calculate survival. All calcu￾lations were performed using the software package
GraphPad Prism, Version 5.0 for Windows (GraphPad
Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Statistical significance is
considered at p < 0.05.
Results
Surgical groupDemographics
Patient mean age was 51.5 ± 10.89 years, and mean dia￾lysis vintage was 12.93 ± 8 years. Mean preoperative
iPTH was 142.08 ± 64.01 pmol/l, and mean serum cal￾cium level was 2.50 ± 0.45 mmol/l (Table 1). All
patients reported diffuse pruritus, arthromyalgia and
mood alterations, while the incidence of baseline cardio￾vascular pathologies is reported in Table 2. No case of
calciphylaxis was reported. Twelve patients (40%) suf￾fered from coexisting thyroid pathology. None of them
had iron deficiency or external blood loss and a mild or
moderate anemia (Hb level 7 - <12 gr/dl) was observed
(Table 1).
Surgical outcomes
TP and TPai were followed by comparable functional
outcomes. Surgical treatment produced a benefit in
terms of itching, a substantial improvement in clinical

osteoarticular symptoms as well as in mood patterns
first, and later in sleep disorders [14-16], an increase in
muscular strength, which were associated to a statisti￾cally significant reduction in PTH levels (Figure 1), ESA
need and improvement of Hb levels. With regard to
twelve-months Hb levels, 26/30 pts (86.6%) showed a
significant increase and 5 (19.2%) of them had an Hb
level >12 gr/dl. No significant variations were reported
in 4/30 pts (13.3%).
Regarding the postoperative ESA dosage, 27/30 pts
(90%) did not need drug treatment, whilst 3/30 pts
(10%) needed a lower dosage. No significant peri- or
postoperative complications were observed. None of the
patients was found to be aparathyroid (Table 3). Eigh￾teen patients (60%) required intravenous postoperative
administration of calcium gluconate due to hypocalce￾mia, which was occasionally severe, with a minimum
value of 1.42 mmol/L, but was never associated with
hypocalcemic seizures. The definitive histological exami￾nation confirmed the hyperplasia of the removed glands;
2 patients (6.6%) had 5 hyperplastic glands; 8 patients
(26.6%) had an associated multinodular goiter, 2 (6.6%)
an adenomatous goiter and 2 (6.6%) a papillary carci￾noma. Table 3 shows immediate (on postoperative day 1)
and long term TP-TPai functional results. After one year,
Computed Bone Mineralometry and skeletal x-rays
showed a clear regression of osteodystrophy in all
patients, irrespective of the procedure carried out. No
long-term pathological fractures were reported. In 18/30
patients -54%- postoperative cardiovascular events were
observed and mortality rate was 23.3% (Table 4). One
patient died for abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture, 3 for
congestive hearth failure and 3 for myocardial infarction
(after a postoperative mean interval time of 27.2 months).
One patient also died for a pulmonary cancer.
Medical groupDemographics
Patient mean age was 55 ± 11.20 years, and mean dialy￾sis vintage was 10 ± 1.96 years. Mean preoperative
iPTH was 102.94 ± 32.51 pmol/l, and mean serum cal￾cium level was 2.4 ± 0,65 mmol/l (Table 1). All patients
reported similar clinical symptoms with respect to the
surgical group, while cardiovascular disease was found
in 20%. Incidence of baseline cardiovascular pathology is
reported in Table 2. No case of calciphylaxis was
reported. No iron deficiency or external blood loss was
observed, while and a mild or moderate anemia (Hb
level 7 - <12 gr/dl) was present in every case.
Outcomes
Pathological fractures were not reported. Cardiovascular
events are reported in Table 4. Mortality rate was 15%.
Two patients died for cardiovascular disease.
Discussion
In the present series, PTx did not demonstrate a protec￾tive effect against major cardiovascular events, with
respect to the incidence observed in the medical control
group and also the mortality rate, in patients affected by
severe preoperative cardiovascular diseases, was unaf￾fected by surgery (Figure 2), probably because surgery
was indicated in 2HPT advanced stages. Even if preo￾perative iPTH serum levels were higher in surgical
patients, the compared groups were similar in 2HPT
stage, demographics and preoperative clinical data.
According to the literature, a lower cardiovascular
events-risk was expected in patients undergoing surgery.
Dramatic reductions in iPTH serum levels, Ca, P, Ca ×
P, increase in hematocrit and Hb levels and, possibly, a
significant decrease of ESA needs, in most surgical
patients, could explain PTx beneficial effects in HD
population. In 2HPT of CKD-MBD, pathological modifi￾cations of mineral metabolism, particularly phosphate
(18), worsening atherosclerosis symptoms and favoring
arterial stiffness, increase the risk of cardiovascular mor￾bidity and mortality. Liu et al. reported a high preva￾lence of CKD-MBD in HD patients with coronary
arteries disease diagnosed by coronary angiography [27].
Furthermore, uremia is linked to platelet and coagula￾tion dysfunction [28]. Valvular and arterial wall calcifica￾tions, depending on common pathogenetic mechanisms

[29], left ventricular hypertrophy and hypertension, are
the main unfavorable prognostic factors. Regarding the
relationship between cardiac valves calcification and
mortality rate, US cardiac valves calcifications were pre￾sent in 5 of the 7 patients who died in our series. Early
surgery could offer a remarkable improvement in the
quality of life and, possibly, a higher long-term survival
rate. Successful surgical treatment often results in a dra￾matic reduction of iPTH levels, relieving the patient
from clinical symptoms, improving nutritional state and
immunity, relieving insomnia and improving cognitive
function [14,16,30,31]. Moreover, different papers
showed that PTX could also improve mortality and car￾diovascular morbidity [18-23]. B Dussol et al. [32]
reported that PTx is the main cause of postoperative
hypoparathyroidism in HD patients, and is associated
with a lower mortality risk, suggesting that a more
aggressive 2HPT treatment could decrease mortality. Y
Tominaga et al. reported, after PTx, an overall 10-year
survival rate of 77.6% in 2000 observed patients [22],
higher than that observed in our series (5 years survival
of 76.7%). According to the present data, PTx did not
demonstrate a protective role against cardiovascular
events, and did not modify severe effects of unfavorable
vascular uremic ossification. Our results were compar￾able to those finally reported by EVOLVE Trial [9],
demonstrating that, similarly to our surgical trial, calci￾mimetics likewise did not significantly reduce the risk of
death or major cardiovascular events in HD patients
affected by moderate-severe 2HPT. Different experimen￾tal and clinical studies tried to explain beneficial effects
of PTx on cardiovascular outcomes, but they remain
unclear [19]. Reductions of iPTH, Ca, P, and increase in
serum albumin, hematocrit are the main investigated
factors. According to AJ Bleyer et al. [33], PTx may also
induce vascular remodeling, but in our series no post￾operative regression of cardiovascular calcification was
observed. KR Neves et al. [34] suggested that P stimu￾lates the transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells
into osteoblast-like cells, creating a promineralization
environment. Uremia is associated with a loss of inhibi￾tors of calcification [35] and in addition, parathyroid
hormone, acting on vascular system via PTH2 receptors
[36,37], may increase atherosclerosis by stimulating vas￾cular smooth muscle cells collagen production [33], or
by increasing receptor of advanced glycation end pro￾ducts (RAGE), monocyte-macrophages cytokines and
IL-6 expressions [38]. Thus, PTx, with a low morbidity
rate similar to that reported in thyroid surgery [39-47],
reducing iPTH levels [30], may determine a lower cardi￾ovascular complications rate.
The compared groups were similar in 2HPT stage,
demographics and preoperative clinical data, but the
relatively small number of examined subjects was the
main limitation of this retrospective analysis. Moreover,

it must be considered that calcimimetics were not admi￾nistered; therefore, the impact of novel therapies is not
known.
Conclusions
Our study supports the following: PTx determined a
remarkable improvement of quality of life in all cases.
However, the lower expected cardiovascular events rate
following PTx, compared to that observed in non-surgical
patients, was not confirmed. Moreover, mortality was
unaffected by surgery, with a 5 years survival of 76.7%.
Therefore, a more aggressive multimodal 2HPT treatment
should be suggested. Calcimimetics, as well as early sur￾gery, in unresponsive to medical treatment HD patients,
may offer an improved quality of life and possibly a higher
long-term survival, only if implemented in 2HPT initial
stage. Further studies will be useful to clarify the role of
2HPT in determining unfavorable cardiovascular out￾comes and mortality in HD population.
