Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is the third most common endogenously produced gaseous signaling molecule, but its impact
on hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, especially on mitochondrial function, remains unclear. In this study, rats
were randomized into Sham, I/R, ischemia preconditioning (IPC) or sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS, an H2S donor)
preconditioning groups. To establish a model of segmental (70%) warm hepatic ischemia, the hepatic artery, left
portal vein and median liver lobes were occluded for 60 min and then unclamped to allow reperfusion.
Preconditioning with 12.5, 25 or 50 μmol/kg NaHS prior to the I/R insult significantly increased serum H2S levels, and,
similar to IPC, NaHS preconditioning decreased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase
(AST) levels in the plasma and prevented hepatocytes from undergoing I/R-induced necrosis. Moreover, a sub-toxic
dose of NaHS (25 μmol/kg) did not disrupt the systemic hemodynamics but dramatically inhibited mitochondrial
permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening and thus prevented mitochondrial-related cell death and apoptosis.
Mechanistic studies revealed that NaHS preconditioning markedly increased the expression of phosphorylated
protein kinase B (p-Akt), phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (p-GSK-3β) and B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2)
and decreased the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c and cleaved caspase-3/9 levels. Therefore, NaHS
administration prior to hepatic I/R ameliorates mitochondrial and hepatocellular damage through the inhibition of
MPTP opening and the activation of Akt-GSK-3β signaling. Furthermore, this study provides experimental evidence
for the clinical use of H2S to reduce liver damage after perioperative I/R injury.

Introduction
Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury influences the
prognosis of patients in a variety of clinical contexts, including
transplantation, liver resection surgery, trauma and
hemorrhagic shock [1,2]. However, the current therapeutic
treatment strategies used to prevent hepatic I/R injury are not
optimal because the underlying molecular mechanisms remain
unclear. Evidence suggests that liver I/R injury occurs along
with an inflammatory process that causes cellular damage due
to complex factors, such as the production of reactive oxygen
species (ROS), chemokines, and cytokines [3]. The disruption
of intracellular energy metabolism, which results in adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) depletion, an accumulation of sodium and
edema [4], suggests that mitochondria play an important role in
I/R injury.

the inner mitochondrial membrane has been implicated in I/R

injury. It causes a disruption of the proton gradient and
electrical potential across the inner mitochondrial membrane,
which leads to an influx of solutes and water and eventual
rupture of the outer membrane, culminating in necrotic cell
death. In addition, cytochrome c, apoptosis-inducing factor
(AIF) and Ca2+, which are released from the mitochondria,
activate procaspase-9 and other members of the caspase
family [5,6,7,8], which lead to apoptosis. Previous studies have
shown that inhibiting MPTP opening by activating intracellular
signal transduction pathways, such as the phosphoinositide 3'-
OH kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt), extracellular regulated
protein kinases (ERK1/2) and the Janus kinase/signal
transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathways,
can alleviate I/R injury [9,10,11,12].
For many years, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) was considered a
toxic agent that, at high concentrations, could reversibly inhibit
complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase), the terminal enzyme
complex in the electron transport chain [13]. Recently, H2S has
been recognized as a third inorganic gaseous mediator
[14,15,16], in addition to nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide
(CO), and can thus influence various cellular processes. H2S is
produced by cystathionine-β-synthase, cystathionine-γ-lyase
and 3-mercapto-pyruvate-sulfur-transferase in mammalian cells
[17]. Two-thirds of H2S molecules dissociate into hydrogen ions
(H+
) and bisulfide ions (HS-
) under physiological conditions
[18]. Therefore, sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) can be
administered as a water-soluble H2S donor. The diverse
physiological functions of H2S make it capable of protecting the
heart [19], brain [20], liver [21,22,23], kidney [24], and lung [25]
against I/R injury when given at sub-toxic doses. In the liver,
the underlying mechanisms of protection appear to include
suppressing oxidative stress via antioxidant activities, reducing
inflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF￾α), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and intercellular cell adhesion
molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and reducing hepatocyte apoptosis.
Additionally, H2S can up-regulate B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2)
expression [22,23]. However, whether H2S preserves
mitochondrial function in hepatic I/R injury remains unclear.
Therefore, we employed a rat model of 70% warm hepatic I/R
to elucidate the role of H2S preconditioning on the susceptibility
of the MPTP and the underlying mechanism of H2S-mediated
protection of the liver.
Materials and Methods
Materials
NaHS was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO). Antibodies for Akt, phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt),
GSK3β, phosphorylated GSK-3β (p-GSK-3β), Bcl-2, activated
caspase-3/9 and cytochrome c were purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology (CST, Boston, MA). The Calcium
Green-5N probe was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA,
USA). All other chemical reagents were of pure analytic grade.
Animals and surgery
Eight-week-old male Sprague–Dawley rats (weighing
200-220 g), obtained from Sino-British Sippr/BK Lab Animal Ltd
(Shanghai, China), received a standard laboratory diet
containing 12% fat, 28% protein, and 60% carbohydrates and
were housed under SPF conditions according to the
institutional guidelines. The study protocol was approved by the
Committee on the Ethics of Biomedicine Research of the
Second Military Medical University (Approval file number:
2009LL029). Our experimental design is illustrated in Figure 1.
Briefly, animals were randomly divided into one of the following
groups: the sham operation (Sham) group; hepatic ischemia/
reperfusion (I/R) group; ischemia preconditioning (IPC) group;
and three NaHS preconditioning groups, which received 12.5,
25 or 50 μmol/kg of NaHS prior to the induction of I/R injury.
IPC was performed by routine vascular clamping prior to the
induction of long-term ischemia. Given that IPC has been
shown to have protective effects through the activation of
multiple protective signaling pathways during I/R [26,27], we
chose it as a positive control. All animals were fasted for 12
hours prior to surgery and anesthetized with pentobarbital (1%,
40 mg/kg) intraperitoneally. The left femoral vein was exposed
and cannulated to infuse 0.9% saline and drugs, while the left
femoral artery was cannulated to measure the heart rate (HR)
and the mean arterial pressure (MAP). A model of segmental
(70%) warm hepatic I/R was established as described
previously, with minor modifications [28]. Briefly, after a midline
laparotomy, an atraumatic clip was used to interrupt the arterial
and portal venous blood supply to the left and median liver
lobes for 60 min. Reperfusion was initiated by removal of the
clamp. Sham-operated rats underwent the same procedure but
without vascular occlusion. IPC rats received 10 min of
ischemia and 10 min of reperfusion before the 60 min ischemic
insult. Rats in the NaHS group were treated with different
NaHS solutions (12.5, 25 or 50 μmol/kg) through the left
femoral vein 5 min prior to the onset of liver ischemia, and the
other groups received a comparable volume of saline. During
the surgery, the animals’ core body temperatures were
maintained at 37°C using heat pads and lamps. The rats were
sacrificed after 4 or 24 h of reperfusion, and liver and serum
samples were collected for analysis.
Measurement of H2S concentration and
aminotransferase levels in the plasma
The rats were euthanized 4 h after reperfusion. Blood
samples were immediately collected from the heart and
centrifuged to obtain plasma. H2S concentrations in the plasma
were measured as previously described [21]. Briefly, 75 μL of
plasma was mixed with 250 μL of 10% trichloroacetic acid, 250
μL of 1% zinc acetate and 150 μL of distilled water in a 1.5 ml
Eppendorf tube. Subsequently, 133 μL of 20 mmol/L N￾dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine sulfate and 133 μL of 30 mmol/L
FeCl3
 were added to the plasma, and the reaction mixture was
incubated at room temperature (25°C) for 10 min followed by
centrifugation at 32,900×g for 5 min. The absorbances of the
resulting supernatants were read at 670 nm with a micro-plate
reader (Model 680, BioRad, USA). All samples were assayed
in duplicate, and the concentrations of each sample were
calculated based on a standard curve constructed with known
concentrations of NaHS. The serum levels of alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)

were determined with a multi-analyzer (H-7600; Hitachi Ltd.,
Tokyo, Japan).
Histology
Liver tissue samples were collected, fixed with formalin and
embedded in paraffin for histological analyses. Liver sections
(4 μm) were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) and
analyzed in a blinded manner. The severity of I/R injury was
graded with Suzuki’s criteria [29], with some modifications.
Briefly, in this classification, sinusoidal congestion, hepatocyte
necrosis, and ballooning degeneration were graded from 0 to 4.
Samples without any necrosis, congestion or centrilobular
ballooning were given a score of 0, whereas samples with
severe congestion, ballooning degeneration and greater than
60% lobular necrosis were given a score of 4. A terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling
(TUNEL) stain was performed with a commercial kit from
Roche (Rotkreuz, Switzerland), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. In each section, areas without
significant necrosis in 10 different visual fields (400×) were
analyzed for TUNEL-positive cells. A TUNEL index was
calculated by counting the total nuclei and the cells with brown
nuclei in the peri-infarcted area of five visual fields. The TUNEL
index was determined using the following formula: (number of
stained cells/number of stained cells + number of unstained
cells) *100. Four sections of tissues were analyzed for each
group.
Systemic hemodynamic status measurement
To determine the systemic hemodynamic status of the
animals, the rats were first anesthetized with pentobarbital. A
polyethylene catheter (PE 50; Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MA)
was advanced through the left femoral artery and into the
descending aorta to measure the central mean arterial
pressure (MAP). The catheters were flushed intermittently with
saline solution containing 2.5 IU/mL bovine heparin. The MAPs
and heart rates (HRs) of the rats were measured with a multi￾channel physical recorder (MPA 2000, Alcott Biotech,
Shanghai, China) during the I/R insult.
Mitochondria isolation
Mitochondria were isolated by gradient centrifugation as we
previously described [25]. Briefly, fresh liver tissues (1 g) were
homogenized with 8 ml of isolation buffer containing 220
mmol/L D-mannitol, 70 mmol/L sucrose, 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 1
mmol/L EGTA, and 0.4% bovine serum albumin (pH 7.4). The
homogenates were centrifuged at 850×g for 10 min to collect
supernatants, followed by centrifugation at 10,000×g for an
additional 10 min. The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in
a final wash buffer containing 220 mmol/L D-mannitol, 70
mmol/L sucrose, and 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The total
protein concentration was determined with the biuret method
and was calibrated to a standard curve generated with bovine
serum albumin.
Calcium retention capacity
A calcium retention capacity (CRC) assay was adapted from
a previously described method [25]. Briefly, the CRC was
defined as the amount of Ca2+ required to trigger a massive
Ca2+ release in isolated liver mitochondria. It was used as an
indicator of the resistance of the MPTP to opening after matrix
Ca2+ accumulation and is expressed as nmol CaCl2
 per mg
Figure 1. Experimental design. Rats underwent 60 min of ischemia followed by 4 or 24 h of reperfusion. Ischemia
preconditioning (IPC) consisted of 10 min of ischemia and 10 min of reperfusion before the full 60 min of ischemia insult. For the
NaHS groups, different doses of NaHS (12.5, 25 or 50 μmol/kg) were injected intravenously 5 min prior to the onset of liver
ischemia. I/R, ischemia/reperfusion.

mitochondrial protein. The extramitochondrial Ca2+
concentration was determined with a fluorescence microplate
reader controlled by SOFTmax PR software (Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) in the presence of 1 µmol/L
Calcium Green-5N molecular probe, with the excitation and
emission wavelengths set at 505 and 535 nm, respectively.
The fluorescence scan interval was set at 12 s. Isolated
mitochondria (2 mg total protein) were suspended in 1 ml of
incubation buffer (220 mmol/L D-mannitol, 70 mmol/L sucrose,
1 mmol/L Pi-Tris, 10 mmol/L Tris-MOPS, 5 mmol/L glutamate￾Tris, and 2.5 mmol/L malate-Tris, pH 7.4, containing 0.01%
[w/v] bovine serum albumin and 1 μmol/L of the Ca2+ indicator
Calcium Green-5N) in a clear 24-well plate. After a 120 s pre￾incubation period, 10 nmol CaCl2
 pulses were performed every
60 s to calculate the CRC. After sufficient calcium loading, the
extra-mitochondrial calcium concentration abruptly increased,
indicating a massive release of calcium by the mitochondria as
a result of MPTP opening.
Western blot analysis
The levels of Akt, GSK3β, Bcl-2, caspase-3 and caspase-9
were determined in liver lysates. Cytochrome c levels were
determined in cytoplasmic extracts according to the method of
Ludovic Gomez [30]. Briefly, liver tissues were homogenized in
lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). After removing the
nuclei and cell debris by centrifugation at 850×g for 10 min at
4°C, the supernatants were further centrifuged at 10,000×g for
10 min at 4°C. Then, the supernatants were collected for
cytoplasmic cytochrome c analysis. The protein concentration
of the extracts was determined by the BCA protein assay
(Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). An equal amount of protein from
each sample was separated on an SDS polyacrylamide gel and
transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore,
Temecula, CA, USA). After incubation with the indicated
primary antibodies, the blots were probed with a goat anti￾rabbit or an anti-mouse secondary horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)-conjugated antibody (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and
developed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents
(Pierce). The relative amount of the target protein was
normalized to β-actin and analyzed with a Gel Pro Analyzer
(Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA).
Statistical analysis
The hemodynamic data are presented as the median
(range). Data within groups were analyzed with a Friedman
repeated-measures ANOVA on ranks and a subsequent post￾hoc multiple comparison procedure (Dunn method).
Differences between treatment groups within one
measurement point were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney U
rank sum test for unpaired samples. Other data are expressed
as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical analysis was
performed with a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and
comparisons between tested groups were conducted with LSD
tests. SPSS 10.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for
the statistical analysis. In all cases, a P value <0.05 was
considered to be statistically significant.
Results
H2S preconditioning reduces I/R-induced hepatic injury
To identify the effect of different preconditioning doses of
NaHS on hepatic injury, the serum levels of H2S, ALT and AST
were measured 4 h after reperfusion. Preconditioning with
12.5, 25 or 50 μmol/kg NaHS five minutes prior to the ischemic
insult markedly increased the serum concentration of H2S
(Figure 2) and reduced the serum levels of ALT and AST to
varying degrees (Figure 3) compared with the I/R group. These
results imply that the NaHS preconditioning alleviated the
hepatic damage caused by the I/R injury. However, the
reduction of ALT and AST serum levels did not occur in an H2S
concentration-dependent manner, as no difference could be
found between the 25 μmol/kg and 50 μmol/kg NaHS-treated
groups (ALT: 706U/L in 25 μmol/kg versus 832 U/L in 50
μmol/kg NaHS; AST: 509 U/L in 25 μmol/kg NaHS versus 512
U/L in 50 μmol/kg NaHS, P >0.05). Next, H-E staining was
performed on the liver tissues after 24 h of reperfusion, and a
Suzuki’s score was calculated to measure the severity of
hepatocyte injury. These scores further confirmed the above
results. Rats that were preconditioned with 25 or 50 μmol/kg
NaHS and rats that received IPC displayed less liver damage
(Figure 4A) and lower Suzuki’s scores (Figure 4B) than rats in
the I/R group. These results suggested that NaHS
preconditioning protects rats from I/R-induced hepatic injury by
inhibiting cell death, similar to IPC. However, in the 50 μmol/kg
NaHS group, 33.3% of rats presented with dyspnea and died
during the surgical procedure, which was likely caused by H2S￾related lung injury, as previously reported [31]. Therefore, we
decided to use a sub-toxic dose of NaHS (25 μmol/kg) to
further investigate the protective mechanisms of H2S on
hepatic I/R.
H2S preconditioning has no effect on systemic
hemodynamics during I/R injury
Alterations in systemic hemodynamics and organ blood
supply may contribute to I/R injury. Thus, the systemic
hemodynamics of rats in the I/R, IPC and NaHS (25 μmol/kg)
groups were measured at six different time points (before
ischemia; 20, 40 and 60 min after ischemia; and 2 h and 4 h
after reperfusion). There was a transient drop in blood pressure
during the rapid intravenous injection of 25 μmol/kg NaHS,
which was quickly restored to the baseline level after the
injection (data not shown). At each time point, the HRs and
MAPs were not significantly different between rats in the NaHS
group and the I/R and IPC groups (Table 1). These results
indicated that NaHS preconditioning did not have an effect on
systemic hemodynamics; however, there may be other
mechanisms by which H2S reduced cell death and protected
the liver from I/R injury.
H2S regulates MPTP opening
The MPTP is an important master regulator of cell death in
I/R injury. Several signaling pathways, such as the PI3K-Akt
pathway, Erk1/2 pro-survival kinase pathway and JAK-STAT
pathway, regulate the MPTP during reperfusion [11,32].
However, the effects of H2S on the MPTP in hepatic I/R remain

unclear. Therefore, to identify MPTP susceptibility to H2S
preconditioning, we evaluated the CRC of mitochondria
isolated from the liver after 24 h of reperfusion. As shown in
Figure 5, a single preconditioning dose of 25 μmol/kg NaHS
significantly improved the ability of mitochondria to tolerate
calcium induction, which strongly improved the CRC, compared
with the I/R group. Because MPTP opening is an important
factor in determining whether I/R-induced cell death occurs
during reperfusion, our findings suggest that H2S may protect
hepatocytes from I/R injury by inhibiting MPTP opening.
H2S suppresses cytochrome c release and caspase
activation
MPTP opening causes mitochondrial-related cell apoptosis,
which involves cytochrome c release and caspase activation
[33]. Therefore, we next investigated the effect of H2S on
apoptosis inhibition. TUNEL staining was performed to identify
the effect of 25 μmol/kg NaHS on hepatocyte apoptosis. As
showed in Figure 6A, a single preconditioning dose of 25
μmol/kg NaHS markedly reduced the TUNEL index (22.8% in
NaHS rats versus 38.6% in I/R rats, P < 0.05). Furthermore, we
investigated the effect of H2S on cytochrome c release and
caspase-3/9 activation during hepatic I/R injury. Animals in the
I/R group displayed increased levels of cytosolic cytochrome c
expression compared with the Sham animals, while a dose of
25 μmol/kg NaHS administration prior to I/R insult greatly
lowered the levels of cytochrome c released (Figure 7A).
Cytochrome c release is associated with caspase family
activation; therefore, we analyzed caspase-3 and caspase-9
cleavage with a western blot analysis. As expected, NaHS
preconditioning markedly reduced the cleavage of caspase-9
(Figure 7B) and caspase-3 (Figure 7C). Taken together, these
data suggest that H2S plays a role in preventing mitochondrial￾related hepatocyte apoptosis by suppressing cytochrome c
release and caspase activation during I/R injury.
The effects of H2S on Akt-GSK-3β signaling
PI3K-Akt signaling and reperfusion injury salvage kinase
(RISK) signaling are known to regulate the MPTP [10]. Akt has
been shown to regulate members of the Bcl-2 family, which is
composed of protective proteins involved in the mitochondrial
apoptotic pathway. Moreover, Akt regulates the
phosphorylation of GSK-3β [32,34], a pivotal enzyme
implicated in MPTP regulation. Thus, we assessed the effect of
preconditioning with 25 μmol/kg NaHS on Akt signaling in the
liver after 24 h of reperfusion. As expected, NaHS
preconditioning increased Bcl-2 (Figure 8A), p-ser9-GSK3β
(Figure 8B) and p-Akt expression (Figure 8C), which indicates
Figure 2. Serum levels of H2S. Rats in the different groups were treated as described in Figure 1. Serum levels of H2S were
assayed in the animals after 4 h of reperfusion. Rats that received a preconditioning dose of 12.5, 25 or 50 μmol/kg NaHS displayed
significantly increased serum levels of H2S compared to rats in the I/R group. At least six rats were included in each study group.
The results are expressed as the mean ± SD. * P < 0.05 versus I/R.

that NaHS preconditioning reduced MPTP opening by
activating the PI3K-Akt-GSK3β signaling pathway.
Discussion
IPC has been shown to alleviate hepatic I/R injury through
the activation of protective signaling pathways and can be
applied in clinical practice [26]. However, it may cause greater
blood loss during the reperfusion period and a prolonged
surgery course, which restricts its applications [35,36,37]. For
this reason, an effective pharmacological approach for
ischemia preconditioning is urgently needed. Recently, H2S has
shown therapeutic potential in protecting against I/R injury.
Recently, a study that exposed mice to various
concentrations of H2S demonstrated that with sub-toxic
concentrations, there is a linear relationship between the
concentration of inhaled H2S and an organ protection effect.
The study also revealed that a high concentration of H2S has
definite toxicity [13]. Therefore, no more than 100 ppm H2S gas
was administered to the mice [23,38,39]. It is more accurate to
administer NaHS by intravenous injection for animals such as
rats and pigs. Sodha et al. found that intravenous
administration of sodium sulfide (100 mg/kg bolus + 1 mg/kg/h
continuous infusion) 10 min prior to the onset of reperfusion
was cardioprotective during porcine cardiac I/R injury [40].
Intravenous administration of 0.2 or 0.4 μmol/kg H2S
significantly decreased the apoplexy index, neurological
symptom scoring, and infarcted areas of the brain in a dose￾dependent manner in a rat model of cerebral I/R injury [41].
Yen et al. found that administration of 30 μmol/kg NaHS
reduced infarct size and prevented cardiomyocyte apoptosis in
a rat model of myocardial I/R injury [42]. In the present study,
we evaluated the potential role of H2S in a model of 70% warm
hepatic I/R. Our results showed that pretreatment with 12.5, 25,
or 50 μmol/kg NaHS decreased ALT and AST levels in the
plasma and that the higher two doses significantly decreased
the Suzuki’s scores for the tissues (Figures 3 and 4). However,
33.3% of rats in the 50 μmol/kg NaHS group presented with
dyspnea and died during the surgical procedure, which is likely
caused by H2S-related lung injury, as Francis et al. previously
reported [43]. Therefore, we decided to use a sub-toxic dose of
NaHS (25 μmol/kg), which is similar to that used by Yen et al.
[42], to further investigate the mechanisms of H2S on hepatic
I/R.
Systemic hemodynamic alteration and organ blood supply
may contribute to I/R injury. Previous research on a porcine
model of cardiac I/R injury showed that intravenous
administration of sulfide improved the noradrenaline

responsiveness during reperfusion after aortic occlusion,
implying that H2S may stabilize the hemodynamics in large￾animal models [31]. However, there is no direct evidence that
H2S has an effect on systemic dynamics. Our study confirmed
that intravenous injection of 25 μmol/kg NaHS had no effect on
systemic hemodynamics at various time points in a rat model of
70% warm hepatic I/R, which is widely used in studies focused
on hepatic I/R [25,28,44,45,46,47]. Given that the hepatic
portal system was not completely blocked (with the blood
supply maintained in the right lobe and the caudate lobe), the
blood returns from the postcava to the right atrium unaffected.
Thus, this model causes few interruptions of the systemic
dynamics and has a low mortality rate. Additionally, the
ischemia phase lasted for only 60 min, which would have a
comparably smaller impact to the long term ischemia insult,

 pulses to mitochondria isolated after 24 h of reperfusion. At the end of the preincubation
period, 10 nmol CaCl2
 pulses were performed every 60 s in 1 ml of 2 mg/ml mitochondria incubation buffer. After sufficient calcium
loading, the extra-mitochondrial calcium concentration abruptly increased, indicating a massive release of calcium by mitochondria
as a result of MPTP opening. The CRC was then calculated. NaHS preconditioning significantly restored the ability of mitochondria
to tolerate calcium induction compared with mitochondria from rats that only received I/R. (B) Calcium retention capacity after 24 h

30 min) [48]. This evidence implies that the protective effects of
NaHS are not achieved by influencing the systemic dynamics.
Thus, it likely works through different underlying mechanisms.
There are several molecular processes that are targeted by
H2S to mediate injury protection [49]: (1) cell signaling, which
plays various roles in anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic
processes; (2) ion channels, specifically, activation of the KATP
channel and inhibition of Ca2+ channels; (3) metabolism; and
(4) protein modifications. The effects of these molecular targets
provide evidence that H2S potentially mediates mitochondrial
protection and thus prevents I/R injury. Although previous
studies have shown that H2S preconditioning can up-regulate
Bcl-2 expression in hepatocytes during I/R [22,23], the detailed
mechanisms underlying H2S-mediated mitochondrial protection
remain unclear.
Our data revealed that administration of a single dose of
NaHS (25 μmol/kg) 5 min before ischemia significantly
increased the H2S concentration in the plasma (Figure 2).
Furthermore, similar to IPC, H2S pretreatment further protected
rats against I/R-induced hepatic injury, as shown by the
decreased serum levels of ALT and AST (Figure 3) and the
maintenance of the normal morphological structure of liver cells
(Figure 4). In addition, our results suggested that H2S
preconditioning inhibited MPTP opening by improving the CRC
(Figure 5) and reduced cell apoptosis (Figure 6) by inhibiting
cytochrome c release and caspase-3 and caspase-9 activation
during reperfusion (Figure 7). These findings provided strong
evidence that, similar to IPC, H2S preconditioning preserves
mitochondrial function and reduces mitochondria-mediated
hepatocyte apoptosis.
Akt is an initiator of the downstream pathways that inhibit
apoptosis. It phosphorylates Bad and ultimately inhibits
cytochrome c release through blocking the channel formed by
Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) in the mitochondrial
membrane [50]. Moreover, Akt can phosphorylate GSK3β to
prevent MPTP opening. Therefore, we examined the Akt￾GSK-3β signaling pathway to elucidate how H2S modulates
MPTP opening and mitochondrial function. We found that
NaHS preconditioning significantly increased Bcl-2 and p-Akt
levels (Figure 8A and Figure 8E). Members of the Bcl-2 family
can regulate MPTP opening, and Bcl-2 can prevent MPTP
depolarization [51,52]. Furthermore, our data indicate that
NaHS preconditioning significantly enhanced Akt
phosphorylation and GSK-3β phosphorylation at Ser9 (Figure
8B and Figure 8E). Previous studies demonstrated that
GSK-3β phosphorylation at Ser9 leads to interactions with
MPTP regulators and inhibits MPTP opening during reperfusion
[3]. The present study demonstrates that H2S can increase
Bcl-2 protein levels, inhibit MPTP opening, decrease activation
of the cytochrome c-caspase-3/9 apoptosis pathway, reduce
cell apoptosis and protect hepatic cells from I/R injury via
activating Akt-GSK-3β signaling.
I/R-induced hepatocyte injury is a complicated process, and
many aspects of damage are related to mitochondria.
Therefore, the experiments presented here only addressed
some major mechanistic pathways relevant to this process.
Further research is required to explore additional mechanisms
that may be involved.

Conclusion
In conclusion, our data demonstrate a novel function for H2S
whereby it inhibits MPTP opening and protects hepatic cells
from I/R-induced injury. This discovery suggests that H2S could
be a useful agent to preserve liver function in surgical settings,
such as liver transplantation or tumor resections.
