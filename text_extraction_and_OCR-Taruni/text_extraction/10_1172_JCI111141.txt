A B S T R A C T Prednisone-induced insulin resistance
may depend on either reduced sensitivity (receptor
defect) or reduced response to insulin (postreceptor
defect). To clarify the mechanism of prednisone-in￾duced insulin resistance, a [3H]glucose infusion (1 ,uCi/
min) was performed for 120 min before and during a
euglycemic clamp repeated at 100, -1,000, and
-10,000 MU/ml steady state plasma insulin concen￾tration in 10 healthy, normal weight subjects, aged
35±7 yr. Each test was repeated after 7-d administration
of placebo or prednisone (15 plus 15 mg/d per subject),
in a randomized sequence with an interval of 1 mo
between the two tests. Mean fasting blood glucose
(89.5±2.1 vs. 83.7± 1.9 mg/dl) and mean fasting plasma
insulin values (17.8±1.2 vs. 14.3±0.8 AU/ml) were sig￾nificantly higher (P < 0.01) after prednisone. The in￾sulin sensitivity index (glucose metabolic clearance rate
in ml/kg per min) was significantly lower (P < 0.001)
after prednisone at all three steady state plasma insulin
levels: 2.8±0.3 vs. 7.4±1.1 at '100 MU/ml; 6.0±0.5
vs. 12.2±1.1 at -1,000 psU/ml; 7.4±0.6 vs. 14.4±0.5
at -10,000 ,uU/ml. Fasting glucose production (in mg/
kg per min) was significantly higher after prednisone:
3.7±0.2 vs. 2.9±0.2, P < 0.001. Suppression of glucose
production at steady state plasma insulin level of - 100
IAU/ml was less after prednisone (1.01±0.35 vs.
0.14±0.13, NS), and total at - 1,000 and -10,000 1uU/
ml after both prednisone and placebo. The metabolic
kinetic parameters of insulin after prednisone were not
significantly different from those after placebo. In ad￾dition, insulin binding and 3-ortho-methyl-glucose
transport were studied in vitro on fat cells from 16
normal-weight surgical candidates aged 40±8 yr (10

treated with placebo and 6 with prednisone as above).
No significant difference was observed with regard to
specific insulin binding (tested with 1 ng/ml hormone
only), whereas significant transport differences were
noted at the basal level (0.40±0.10 vs. 0.54±0.12 pmol/
105 cells, P < 0.05), and at increasing concentrations
up to the maximum stimulation values (5 ng/ml):
0.59±0.04 vs. 0.92±0.12 pmol/105 cells, P < 0.005.
These results suggest that (a) administration of an an￾tiinflammatory dose of prednisone for 7 d induces in￾sulin resistance in man; (b) this is more dependent on
depressed peripheral glucose utilization than on in￾creased endogenous production; (c) total insulin binding
on isolated adipocytes is not significantly affected; (d)
insulin resistance is primarily the outcome of postre￾ceptor defect (impaired glucose transport).
INTRODUCTION
Like other glucocorticoids (1-4), prednisone increases
blood glucose in man (5). This effect is accompanied
by hyperinsulinemia (insulin resistance) (6) that may
be attributable to either reduced peripheral insulin
sensitivity or increased hepatic glucose production (6).
Different glucocorticoids, too, may exert a different
metabolic effect on the hepatic and peripheral sites
(4). It is not yet known whether this situation reflects
reduced sensitivity (i.e., a receptor defect), a reduced
response to insulin (i.e., a postreceptor defect), or both
(7, 8). Since an increase in insulin binding by gluco￾corticoids was reported in vitro study, a postreceptor
mechanism must be taken in consideration. Account
must also be taken of the fact that glucocorticoids bind
to specific cytoplasmatic receptors and influence cell
metabolism through a second messenger (9, 10) that
also seems to act at the nuclear level. The result is a
control of protein synthesis, maybe including modu￾lation of receptor protein and glucose carriers turnover.

The first postreceptor step, in fact, is that related to
the transmembrane transport of glucose. This step can
now be investigated in man (11).
In vivo use of the euglycemic clamp enables an as￾sessment of insulin action in the periphery and a pro￾visional discrimination between reduced response and/
or reduced sensitivity to the hormone (12). Simulta￾neous examination of endogenous glucose production
under basal conditions and during euglycemic-hyper￾insulinemic clamp (13) offers quantification of the he￾patic level of insulin resistance as well. Joint utilization
of this technique in healthy subjects before and after
an average antiinflammatory dose (30 mg/d) of pred￾nisone should thus permit analysis of the mechanism
whereby this corticosteroid induces insulin resistance.
METHODS
Subjects. Six male and four female healthy volunteers
aged 35±7 yr with no family history of diabetes mellitus,
94±3% ideal body weight, were studied after receiving a
placebo or 15 plus 15 mg (at 8 and 15 h) prednisone tablets
per d for 7 d in a random sequence. Six subjects repeated
the test six times (three after placebo and three after pred￾nisone) respectively at -100, -1,000, and - 10,000 AU/
ml. The other four underwent two tests (one after placebo
and one after prednisone at -100 ,U/ml). Insulin binding
and glucose transport on isolated fat cells were also studied
in 12 males and 4 females aged 40±8 yr, 98±4% ideal body
weight, with no family history of diabetes, operated for cho￾lelithiasis. The females were studied in the first 2 wk of the
menstrual cycle. Prednisone was given before surgery (same
protocol) in six cases and placebo in 10 cases. No marked
differences were found between the treated subjects and the
controls with regard to their eating habits and physical activity
in the months before the study. Physical activity was moderate
in each case. Cholecystectomy was elective and not a matter
of urgency. There was no evidence of inflammatory or in￾fectious disease. The period of hospitalisation before surgery
was 1 wk in all cases. During this time, the patients were
not confined to bed, and engaged in moderate physical ex￾ercise.
No other drug was administered in the previous month.
During the study, diet was balanced in all subjects (30 kcal/
kg, 50% carbohydrates, 30% fats, 20% proteins). Informed
consent was obtained from all subjects.
Test procedure. All studies were carried out at 8 a.m.
after a 12-h overnight fast. The glucose clamp was started
after continuous infusion of 60 jACi/h D-[3-3H]glucose (Amer￾sham, United Kingdom) for 2 h; this was continued throughout
the clamp. Steady state plasma insulin of - 100, - 1,000,
and - 10,000 MU/ml were obtained by infusing 40, 372, and
1,280 mU/m2 per min prompt insulin (regular, Eli Lilly &
Co., Indianapolis, IN), respectively. In the first 10 min, the
insulin dose was augmented according to De Fronzo et al.
(14) and infusion was continued for 2 h. Blood glucose was
kept at ±5% of the fasting value by automatic infusion of a
30% dextrose solution through a Biostator (CGIIS, Ames,
Elkhart, IN). Blood was withdrawn with a double-lumen
Ames catheter in a wrist vein after arterialization by wrapping
the hand in a thermophore at 60°C. Blood gas analyses in
test studies on blood obtained in this manner had shown a
Po2 of 88±3 mmHg. An adjacent cannula in the same vein
was used in the evaluation of plasma glucose and insulin.
The following constants were used in the formula: Dextrose
infusion rate = RD QD + 1); where BD is blood glucose
level at which basal dextrose infusion starts (equal to fasting
blood glucose + 5%); QD is inverse of the static gain for
dextrose infusion (equal to 45); RD is minimal amount of
dextrose infused by Biostator (equal to 0.8 mg/kg X min
[clamp at -100 ,uU/ml], 2 mg/kg X min [clamp at -1,000
IAU/ml], 3 mg/kg X min [clamp at -10,000 ,uU/ml]). The
dextrose infusion tube was replaced by a Baxter hemotrans￾fusing apparatus (flow = 5 ml/min). Potassium aspartate (15
and 25 meq/h, respectively) was infused during the clamp
at steady state plasma insulin -1,000 and -10,000 MU/ml
to prevent hypokalemia. Serum potassium values at the end
of each clamp were not significantly different from the base
lines.
Adipocytes were taken from the periumbilical subcuta￾neous tissue during the first few minutes of narcosis (nitrogen
protoxide) (15).
Analytical procedure. Glucose levels during the in vivo
test automatically measured by the Biostator were also
checked on plasma every 5 min with a Beckman II glucose
analyzer. Good reproducibility was obtained (<5% varia￾tion). For calculation of all indexes, plasma glucose values
were always used.
Specific plasma radioactivity during [3H]glucose infusion
was determined according to Issekutz et al. (16).
Plasma insulin was measured by solid-phase antibody ra￾dioimmunoassay (RIA) (Korning Kit, Medfield, MA). Sepa￾ration of adipocytes by digestion with collagenase was per￾formed as previously described (15). Insulin binding to iso￾lated adipocytes (106 cells) was performed in Krebs-Ringer
bicarbonate buffer pH 7.4 (plus 1% bovine serum albumin)
at 25°C in a 95:5% 02/CO2 atmosphere per 60 min in du￾plicate in the presence of 1 ng/ml monoiodoinsulin. Non￾specific binding was evaluated by subtracting radioactivity
labeled to the cells in the presence of 100 ,ig native insulin.
Adipocytes were separated and radioactivity was counted as
previously reported (15).
Intracellular transport of glucose was performed accord￾ing to Ciaraldi et al. (11). Briefly, cells were preincubated
for 60 min at 37°C in the presence of 0-5 ng/ml insulin.
The substrate used, 3-ortho-methyl-['4C]glucose (3-OMG,l
New England Nuclear, Boston, MA), enters the cell but is
not metabolized. The reaction is blocked after 10 s with 0.3
mM cold phloretin, followed by centrifugation in silicone
oil. The glucose space is corrected by a parallel study with
L-['4C]glucose (Amersham).
Calculations. Endogenous glucose production (milligrams
per killogram per minute) was determined from Steele's for￾mula (17). Fasting glucose production was calculated from
the specific activity value (counts per minute per milliliter)
of plasma glucose during the 110-120-min period of
[3H]glucose infusion (steady state). Glucose production during
the clamp was determined by subtracting the amount of dex￾trose infused from the isotopically determined total glucose
production rate (endogenously produced plus exogenously
infused). Negative glucose production values were treated
as 0 (13, 18). The amount of dextrose infused (milligrams
per kilogram per minute) was calculated every 5 min. The

Mechanism of Prednisone-induced Insulin Resistance 1815

glucose metabolic clearance rate (milliliter per kilogram per
minute) was used to assess peripheral sensitivity to insulin.
Since the euglycemic steady state was almost exactly the
same in the three groups of tests, preference was given to
Verdonk's method for the calculation of glucose metabolic
clearance rate (19): De Fronzo's M20-120 index (milligram per
kilogram per minute) (14) was divided by the mean blood
glucose value (milligram per milliliter). When the glucose
production during the clamp was >0, this value was added
to the M index in calculating the metabolic clearance rate.
Insulin metabolic clearance rate (milliliter per kilogram
per minute) was calculated at all three steady state plasma
insulin levels according to De Fronzo et al. (14), namely:
insulin infusion rate/increase in plasma insulin above the
base line. This formula was used because plasma C-peptide
measured at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min during insulin infusion
was <0.5 ng/ml (RIA, Byk-Mallinckrodt Inc., St. Louis, MO).
During the -100 uU/ml clamp, the insulin basal systemic
delivery rate (milliunits per kilogram per minute) was cal￾culated by multiplying the insulin metabolic clearance rate
by the basal plasma insulin/1,000 according to Mc Guire et
al. (20).
All values were expressed as means±SEM. The t test was
used to compare the means obtained after placebo and pred￾nisone.
RESULTS
Blood glucose and plasma insulin values after placebo
and prednisone are shown in Table I. If fasting plasma
glucose and insulin values are considered as a whole,
it appears that prednisone was responsible for a sig￾nificant (P < 0.01) increase in both plasma glucose
(89.5±2.1 vs. 83.7±1.9 mg/dl) and insulin (17.8±1.2
vs. 14.3±0.8 ,uU/ml), whereas values during steady
state plasma insulin were not significantly different
after placebo and prednisone. Mean values of plasma
glucose, plasma insulin, and dextrose infusion rate dur￾ing euglycemic clamp at all three steady state plasma
insulin levels are reported in Fig. 1. M20-120 values were
significantly lower (P < 0.001) after prednisone at
steady state plasma insulin level: -100 jU/ml (2.5±0.2
vs. 6.1±0.5 mg/kg per min), l1,000,U/ml (4.9±0.2
vs. 11.1±0.6), and -10,000 AU/ml (7.2±0.2 vs.
13.4±0.4).
Glucose metabolic clearance rate (milliliter per ki￾logram per minute) was also significantly (P < 0.001)
reduced after prednisone at all three steady state plasma
insulin levels (Fig. 2): 2.8±0.3 vs. 7.4±1.1 at -100
,uU/ml; 6.0±0.5 vs. 12.2±1.1 at - 1,000 ,uU/ml; 7.4±0.6
vs. 14.4±0.5 at --10,000 ,uU/ml. Fasting glucose pro￾duction was significantly increased after prednisone:
3.7±0.2 vs. 2.9±0.2 mg/kg per min (P < 0.01) (Fig.
3). Suppression of glucose production was never com￾plete during steady state plasma insulin level of - 100
,uU/ml after prednisone (1.01±0.35 vs. 0.14±0.13 mg/
kg per min, NS), whereas total suppression after both
placebo and prednisone was observed at steady state
plasma insulin levels of --1,000 and --10,000 ,uU/ml.
The increase in insulin basal systemic delivery rate
after prednisone was not significant: 0.23±0.02 vs.
0.19±0.01 mU/kg per min. The change in insulin met￾abolic clearance rate after prednisone was not signif￾icant: 14.3±0.7 vs. 13.9±0.7 ml/kg per min at -100
,uU/ml; 10.1±0.7 vs. 12.1±0.8 at -1,000 AU/ml and
3.6±0.2 vs. 3.7±0.3 at - 10,000 ,uU/ml. Specific insulin
binding was determined at only one level of insulin
concentration, owing to the difficulty of obtaining
enough fat for the study of the glucose transport and
the competition curve. It was much the same after
prednisone and placebo (4.45 vs. 4.48%) (Fig. 4). Glu￾cose transport is illustrated in Fig. 5. There is a sig￾nificant decrease after prednisone not only at the base
line (absence of insulin) (0.40±0.10 vs. 0.54±0.12 pmol/
105 cells, P < 0.05), but also at increasing insulin con￾centrations (Fig. 5 A). The kinetics of glucose transport
is significantly different up to the maximum insulin
stimulation of transport (5 ng/ml): 0.59±0.04 vs.
0.92±0.12 pmol/105 cells, P < 0.005. The percentage
of the maximal response was much the same after pla￾cebo and prednisone (Fig. 5 B), whereas the percent
increase over basal transport was lower after prednisone
at insulin concentrations of 0.5 ng/ml (Fig. 5 C).
DISCUSSION
These results suggest that an average antiinflammatory
dose of prednisone administered for 7 d induces insulin
resistance characterized by depressed peripheral uti￾TABLE I

pears to be significantly increased after prednisone in
spite of an increase in plasma insulin. It is clear, there￾fore, that prednisone also promotes insulin resistance
at the hepatic level. The decrease in glucose production
following intravenous insulin was quite the same in the
two groups (basal minus 100 ,uU/ml glucose produc￾tion), indicating that this insulin dose is too high to
show the insulin resistance at the hepatic level. Other
authors (6) used a lower insulin concentration (40 uU/
ml) to study this phenomenon. The hepatic glucose
production was totally suppressed at - 1,000 and
-10,000 ,uU/ml steady state plasma insulin in both
groups. At the hepatic level, therefore, reduced sen￾sitivity to exogenous insulin (rightward shift of the dose￾response curve) is unaccompanied by a change in the
maximum effect.
This finding is quantitatively different from that
obtained by Rizza et al. (6), indicating that 7-d pred￾nisone administration, unlike acute infusion of cortisol,
influences the insulin action in the periphery more
than in the liver.
Further information on the hyperglycemic effect of
prednisone was obtained by the in vitro study of in￾sulin's effects on fat cells. These cells were studied
because they are known targets of both insulin (8, 9)
and steroids. As stated earlier, binding was studied at
only one concentration (1 ng/ml) of insulin, owing to
the difficulty of performing complete binding in parallel
with the study of 3-OMG transport. The percentage of
bound insulin was virtually the same after prednisone
and placebo. The literature on this subject is conflicting
in that there have been reports of an increase (8, 21),
a decrease (22), or no change (23) in the number of
insulin receptors, or a change in receptor affinity (24)

with postreceptor defect(s) was observed after long￾term treatment. Fantus et al. (8), however, in an in
vitro study of insulin binding to IM-9 cultured human
lymphocytes found that corticoids enhance insulin
binding in vitro, whereas hyperinsulinemia in vivo leads
to a reduction in the number of receptors. Thus, the
type of drug and its dose and the duration of treatment
will determine which of these phenomena prevails.
A further comment may be added in the light of the
criticisms leveled by Klotz (26) against application of
the Scatchard analysis to in vitro models. In his opinion,
the graphic method on which determination of both
the number of receptors and the affinity constants is
based is imprecise and subject to variations. From this
it may be deduced that the discrepancies observed in
the literature may also have a technical explanation.
In the absence of a sound alternative method, therefore,
we feel it prudent to report the total specific binding
percentage, even though it is clear that this cannot
distinguish a change in the number of receptors from
a change in their affinity. The outcome is that our
measurement is the result of two phenomena (affinity
and number) that may be the subject of opposing
changes. Insulin binding, therefore, is not significantly
altered by 7-d treatment with 30 mg/d prednisone,
though a variation in affinity as suggested by Yasuda
and Kitabchi (27) cannot be ruled out. In addition,
insulin sensitivity of 3-OMG transport in fat cells was
much the same after both placebo and prednisone (Fig.
5 B). Glucose transport is significantly reduced in the
basal state as well as in the presence of insulin up to
5 ng/ml (maximum effective concentration of insulin
added in vitro) (Fig. 5, A and C). This is clear evidence
of postreceptor defect, in line with our data in vivo
and the deduction of Rizza et al. (6). The existence of
a 3-OMG transport defect could be ascribed to the
nonavailability of the specific carrier described by
Czech (28). According to other workers (29, 30), energy￾and hormone-dependent translocation of the carrier
systems takes place from a pool of intracellular mem￾branes to the plasma membrane.
Since steroids, after binding to cytoplasmic recep￾tors, signal the nucleus (9) and modify cellular enzyme
activities (10), they may have either a direct or indirect
effect on the glucose transport system. Evidence in
favor of a direct effect can be seen in the results of
Olefsky's study (31); dexamethasone action in rat
adipocytes is not due to nonspecific binding to the
plasma membrane but to specific reaction with an in￾tracellular receptor. The possibility of an indirect ef￾fect, however, cannot be entirely ruled out. This could
be due, for example, to the decrease in contrainsular
hormones postulated by some workers (32), or to a
change in intermediary metabolism, as yet undefined.
Lastly, emphasis may be placed on the fact that our
in vitro finding partially conflicts with our in vivo re￾sults. Thus, in vitro we observed only a reduction of
the maximum biological effect, whereas in vivo the
reduction of the maximum biologic effect is associated
with a rightward shift of the dose-response curve. This
discrepancy may perhaps depend on a different pat￾tern of insulin binding in different tissues. Caro and
Amatruda (25), in fact, have shown that cells from
various tissues, or the same cells under different met￾abolic conditions, may respond in different ways to
regulation of their receptor by the hormone (25).
It is clear, therefore, that further work is required
on the interaction between corticosteroids and insulin
effects not only in different cells (especially liver and
muscle tissue), but also in intracellular sites. These are
at present difficult to study, particularly in man. Nev￾ertheless, they attract the greatest interest, since they
are probably more influenced by the direct than the
indirect effects of steroids.
