Abstract
Introduction: Several studies have shown that goal-directed hemodynamic and fluid optimization may result in
improved outcome. However, the methods used were either invasive or had other limitations. The aim of this
study was to perform intraoperative goal-directed therapy with a minimally invasive, easy to use device (FloTrac/
Vigileo), and to evaluate possible improvements in patient outcome determined by the duration of hospital stay
and the incidence of complications compared to a standard management protocol.
Methods: In this randomized, controlled trial 60 high-risk patients scheduled for major abdominal surgery were
included. Patients were allocated into either an enhanced hemodynamic monitoring group using a cardiac index
based intraoperative optimization protocol (FloTrac/Vigileo device, GDT-group, n = 30) or a standard management
group (Control-group, n = 30), based on standard monitoring data.
Results: The median duration of hospital stay was significantly reduced in the GDT-group with 15 (12 - 17.75) days
versus 19 (14 - 23.5) days (P = 0.006) and fewer patients developed complications than in the Control-group [6
patients (20%) versus 15 patients (50%), P = 0.03]. The total number of complications was reduced in the GDT￾group (17 versus 49 complications, P = 0.001).
Conclusions: In high-risk patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, implementation of an intraoperative goal￾directed hemodynamic optimization protocol using the FloTrac/Vigileo device was associated with a reduced
length of hospital stay and a lower incidence of complications compared to a standard management protocol.

Introduction
There is growing evidence that perioperative goal-direc￾ted therapy (GDT) based on flow-related hemodynamic
parameters improves patient outcome [1,2], particularly
in high-risk patients [3,4]. Mean arterial blood pressure
(MAP) and central venous pressure (CVP) are routinely
used to monitor hemodynamics, but no information on
blood flow can be obtained with MAP and CVP. There￾fore, enhanced hemodynamic monitoring seems to be
crucial in the guidance of perioperative volume therapy
and cardiocirculatory support. Previous optimization
studies vary largely with regard to study design and the
complexity of the monitoring technique used. Most of
the trials used the pulmonary artery catheter (PAC)
[5-8] and the esophagus Doppler (ED) method [9-11].
These methods are either highly invasive (PAC) or show
limited accuracy (ED) [12] combined with other disad￾vantages such as frequent dislocation of the ultrasound
probe [13] or poor toleration in awake patients [14].
In the present study, we used the FloTrac/Vigileo, a
minimally invasive device, which only needs standard
arterial access for enhanced, flow-based hemodynamic
monitoring. The device is reported to be easy to use
and easy to set up [15] and calculates the stroke volume
on the basis of the arterial waveform in combination

with demographic data. Recent studies have shown a
good agreement compared with more invasive methods
to determine cardiac output (CO) [16-19]. In this study
we aimed to determine whether an intraoperative opti￾mization protocol using the enhanced flow-based hemo￾dynamic parameters of the FloTrac/Vigileo device would
result in an improvement in outcome in high-risk
patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, measured
by the length of hospital stay (LOS) compared with a
standard protocol based on conventional hemodynamic
data.
Materials and methods
After obtaining written informed consent and Institu￾tional Review Board approval, 60 patients with an
American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical
status (Table 1) [20] of III with two or more risk factors
according to risk index of Lee (Table 2) [21] undergoing
open major abdominal surgery (intestine resection, gas￾tric resection, liver resection, esophageal resection,
Whipple) were studied between 18 January 2008 and 16
March 2009. Patients under 18 years, patients with
severe aortic regurgitation, permanent cardiac arrhyth￾mias, intra-aortic balloon pump and patients undergoing
emergency surgery were excluded from the study.
The study was a single-centre, prospective randomized
trial carried out in a tertiary, university affiliated hospital.
Patients were randomized preoperatively either into a
standard protocol group (control group) or an enhanced,
goal-directed hemodynamic monitoring group (GDT
group) using a closed envelope system. Randomization
was performed by a member of the research team.
In both groups, premedication consisted of midazolam
(0.01 mg kg-1), and standard general anesthesia was
induced with fentanyl 1 to 2 μg kg-1, propofol 1.5 to
2 mg kg-1 and cisatracrurium 0.07 mg kg-1. After intu￾bation of the trachea, the lungs were ventilated to main￾tain normocapnia (end expiratory partial pressure of
carbon dioxide level 32 to 38 mmHg) using a constant
fresh gas flow of 1 L min-1. Maintenance of anesthesia
was performed with 0.9 to 1.8% end tidal sevoflurane,
and fentanyl and cisatracrurium boli were given as
needed. Standard monitoring for both groups included
electrocardiogram, invasive arterial blood pressure via
right or left radial artery, CVP, pulse oximetry, tempera￾ture, inspiratory and expiratory gas concentrations.
In the control group, MAP was kept between 65 and 90
mmHg, CVP between 8 and 12 mmHg and urinary out￾put more than 0.5 mL kg-1 h-1. The GDT-group patients
received enhanced hemodynamic monitoring with the
FloTrac/Vigileo device (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA,
USA) and an attempted cardiac index (CI) of at least 2.5
L·min-1·m-2. The arterial line was connected to the Vigi￾leo monitor (software version 1.14; Edwards Lifesciences,
Irvine, CA, USA) via the FloTrac pressure transducer and
all intravascular pressure measurements were referenced
to mid-axillary line level. The shape of the arterial curve
was checked visually for damping throughout the study
period. CI, stroke volume index (SVI), as an indicator for
fluid status, and stroke volume variation, (SVV) as an
indicator for fluid responsiveness during mechanical ven￾tilation and sinus rhythm, were continuously measured.
Details of the protocols for both standard and enhanced
hemodynamic monitoring are summarized in Figures 1
and 2. Side effects of GDT (e.g. tachycardia during dobu￾tamine infusion) were not acceptable and as soon as they
developed further optimization attempts were ceased and
patients were kept at the best possible level. Blood loss
was substituted with fluids according to the protocols
and a hemoglobin value below 8 mg dL-1 was considered
to be a trigger for transfusion of packed red blood cells.
The respective protocols in both groups were contin￾ued until the transportation monitoring equipment was
attached to the patients, which happened after the end
of surgery and hemodynamic stability. All patients were
admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and both
groups were managed by the same physicians on the
same wards (ICU and general ward) who were not
involved in the intraoperative management, data collec￾tion or group allocation of the study. Complications
were assessed daily by senior anesthesiologists and
senior surgeons blinded to group allocation and study
design using standard predefined criteria. All data were
collected by a study nurse blinded to the study design
and group allocation, except vital data, which were

collected automatically using custom PC software (Nar￾koData, Imeso, Hüttenberg, Germany).
To ascertain comparable preconditions between the
groups with respect to preoperative co-morbidity and
type of surgery, all patients underwent POSSUM (phy￾siological and operative severity score for the enumera￾tion of mortality and morbidity) scoring [22].
Patients were ready for hospital discharge when they
showed stable cardiovascular and respiratory conditions,
ability to take oral fluids, sufficient pain control, mobili￾zation (as far as possible), spontaneous micturition,
infection parameters within normal range, consciousness
comparable with the preoperative state and non-irritated
wound conditions. These criteria were classified by spe￾cialist surgeons, who where not involved in the study
design or group allocation.
Statistical analysis
The primary outcome variable was the duration of hos￾pital stay. Secondary outcome variables were the inci￾dence of perioperative complications, the duration of
the ICU stay, the amount and type of fluids used intrao￾peratively, and the amount and type of vasoactive and
positive inotropic support used intraoperatively.
A MedCalc 4.31 software package (MedCalc Software,
Mariakerke, Belgium) was used for statistical analyses.
The number of patients required in each group was
determined before the study by a power calculation
based on the results of a similar previous study [1]. It
was found that the minimum clinically important differ￾ence we wished to detect was a 20% decrease in the pri￾mary endpoint duration of hospital stay. With an
assumed a error of 0.05 (two-sided) and type II error of
0.2, we found 24 patients per group to be required. To
compensate for possible dropouts, we decided to include
30 patients per group.
The assumption of normality was checked using the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Continuous, normally distrib￾uted data were compared using paired and unpaired
Student’s t-test and a Bonferroni correction for repeated
measurements was applied. Continuous, non-normally
distributed data were compared using the Wilcoxon
test. Binominal data were compared using chi-squared
analysis and Fisher’s exact test. All tests were two-sided
and were performed at a corrected a = 0.05 level unless
otherwise specified.
Results
The patient flow through the study is shown in Figure 3.
Both groups were comparable with respect to age, gen￾der, weight, co-morbidities and the type of surgery as
determined by the Lee classification scheme (Table 2)

[21] and the POSSUM score [22] (Table 3). Anesthetic
requirements and duration of surgery also did not differ
between the groups (Table 4). In the GDT group, we
found a reduced median (interquartile range) duration
of hospital stay of 15 (12 to 17.75) days versus 19 (14 to
23.5; P = 0.006; Figure 4) in the control group. The
number of patients who developed complications was
lower in the GDT group (6 patients, 20%) than in the
control group (15 patients, 50%; P = 0.03) and fewer
complications per group were documented in the GDT
group (17 complications) than in the control group (49
complications; P = 0.001; Table 5). No difference was
found between the groups in the duration of ICU stay
(39.6 ± 39.5 hours in the GDT group vs. 41.9 ± 43.5
hours in the control group; P = 0.70) and postoperative
mechanical ventilation (4.8 ± 4.5 hours in the GDT
group vs. 7.8 ± 10.0 hours in the control group; P =
0.14). Significantly more colloids were administered in
the GDT group (1188 ± 550 ml vs. 817 ± 467 ml; P =
0.006), whereas the amount of crystalloid volume repla￾cement was lower (2489 ± 805 ml vs. 3153 ± 1264 ml;
P = 0.02). The total amount of fluids administered

intraoperatively (including packed red blood cells and
fresh frozen plasma) was not different between the
groups (4528 ± 2317 ml vs. 4494 ± 1561 ml). Positive
inotropic support with dobutamine was higher in the
GDT group (30.4 ± 50.5 μg kg-1 h-2 vs. 4.1 ± 19.0 μg
kg-1h-2; P = 0.01). Administration of norepinephrine,
epinephrine and nitrates was similar between the
groups. No difference was found with regard to urinary
output, loss of blood and blood transfusion. One patient
in the GDT group did not achieve the predefined goals
and optimization attempts were ceased because of
tachyarrhythmia with a CI around 2.2 L·min-1·m-2. All
patients of the control group achieved the predefined
goals. Two postoperative deaths occurred in each group.
In each group, one patient died secondary to anastomo￾tic leakage and sepsis. In one patient of the control
group, myocardial infarction was diagnosed leading to
fatal cardiogenic shock. One patient of the intervention
group developed massive intraabdominal bleeding,
which was fatal before emergency re-laparotomy could
be performed.
Two patients in each group were actually discharged
two days later than possible because of social reasons.
Discussion
Intraoperative GDT based on minimally invasive, flow￾related parameters obtained by autocalibrated arterial
waveform analysis resulted in a significant reduction in

LOS and significantly less perioperative complications
compared with a standard management protocol with
pressure-based target parameters.
The first evidence that flow-based cardiovascular para￾meters such as CO or oxygen delivery index (DO2I) cor￾relate with the outcome in high-risk patients or high￾risk surgery was shown by Shoemaker and colleagues
[23,24]. Although these studies remained controversial,
subsequent work confirmed that goal-directed protocols
for perioperative management using flow-related para￾meters improve patient outcome [1-3,5-8,25,26]. The
underlying mechanisms of the success of GDT are not
yet entirely clear. Most authors assume that an oxygen
debt from decreased blood flow, hypoxia or hypovolemia
may cause mitochondrial damage and subsequent organ
dysfunction [27]. Thus, adequate tissue oxygen supply
seems to play a key role to prevent adverse patient out￾come. Although blood flow to peripheral tissues is diffi￾cult to measure, tissue oxygen supply may be
approximated using the DO2I. However, the DO2I needs
to be calculated from information provided by repeated
blood gas analyses. We therefore decided to use the CI
as the target variable of the GDT protocol in this study,
because this variable can be easily obtained and continu￾ously measured with the arterial waveform analysis
method in a busy intraoperative setting. Together with
adequate hemoglobin levels and arterial oxygen satura￾tion, we considered the CI as an adequate target for
flow-based GDT.
The results of this study are in good agreement with
previous trials dealing with goal-directed hemodynamic
optimization based on flow-related parameters, although
target variables and methods to achieve the goals vary
widely in the literature. Lithium indicator dilution was
used by Pearse and colleagues [1] to determine CO and
DO2I in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery.
In this study, patients in the intervention group were
optimized postoperatively with colloids and dopexamine
to achieve a DO2I of 600 ml min-1 m-2. A significant
reduction in LOS from 29.5 days to 17.5 days and in the
number of patients with complications (69% vs. 44%)
were found in comparison to a CVP-based protocol in a
standard care group. POSSUM score values and surgical
interventions were comparable with the present study,

but Pearse and colleagues initiated their optimization
protocol later with admission to ICU. The Lithium dilu￾tion cardiac output (LiDCO) method was used, which is
considered more invasive and complicated than autocali￾brated arterial waveform analysis because frequent man￾ual recalibrations are required [28] and an artificial
indicator limits the number of calibrations per day [29].
Lopes and colleagues [25] analyzed the effects of intrao￾perative optimization of pulse pressure variation (PPV).
PPV was kept below 10% with colloid boluses in the
intervention group and a significant reduction in LOS
(from 17 to 7 days) and complications (75% of the
patients vs. 41% of the patients) was found. In contrast
to the present study, no protocol for the control group
existed and PPV was the only parameter to guide opti￾mization. Several previous studies used ED as the GDT,
but were mostly limited to fluid optimization [19,10,11].
Noblett and colleagues [11] investigated the effects of
ED-guided intraoperative colloid fluid resuscitation in
patients undergoing colorectal resection and found a
reduced LOS (nine vs. six days) and a reduced compli￾cation rate. The median POSSUM scores, however, were
lower in this study (explaining the shorter LOS), admin￾istration of inotropes was not part of the optimization
protocol and no protocol for the standard care group
existed. The role of the ED method in goal-directed
fluid therapy was investigated in a meta-analysis by
Abbas and Hill [26] and an overall reduction of LOS
and lower complication rates were found in the GDT
groups of five studies, although absolute CO measure￾ments were found to be imprecise [12].
In the present study, the amount of colloids adminis￾tered in the GDT group was significantly higher and the
amount of crystalloids was lower, which could have
been protocol dependant. However, this finding is con￾sistent with findings in other GDT literature, where a
trend towards a more generous administration of col￾loids instead of crystalloids can be seen [1,2,25,30] and
may be most likely a result of an earlier detection of
fluid demand with enhanced hemodynamic monitoring.
Kimberger and colleagues [31] recently investigated the
influence of different volume regimens on tissue perfu￾sion in an animal model and found a significantly
increased microcirculatory blood flow and tissue oxygen
tension with goal-directed administration of colloids.
The ongoing discussion about the ‘optimal’ amount and
type of fluid can at least partially be resolved, as evi￾dence grows that individually titrated, goal-directed
administration of primarily colloid solutions improves
patient outcome in patients undergoing major abdom￾inal surgery [2,25,32].
Permanent cardiac arrhythmias are a problem that
affects almost all methods to determine flow-based
hemodynamic variables, in particular those using the
arterial waveform as source of information. The preci￾sion becomes less accurate and determination of SVV is
not possible. Although temporary, short arrhythmic epi￾sodes can be eliminated by the algorithm of the Vigileo
device, episodes shorter than five minutes were elimi￾nated by ceasing measurements during this time. We
also had to exclude patients with permanent cardiac
arrhythmias, which might be a limitation of this study.
It has also been found that the bolus administration of
vasoactive drugs may affect accuracy of the arterial
waveform-based method [33]. However, bolus adminis￾tration was rarely necessary and measurements were dis￾continued during this period. Furthermore, the study is
underpowered to analyze mortality and patient follow￾up was performed until hospital discharge only.
Conclusions
The results of this study demonstrated that an optimiza￾tion protocol based on flow-related hemodynamic para￾meters obtained with the minimally invasive FloTrac/
Vigileo device reduced the duration of hospital stay and
perioperative complications in high-risk patients under￾going major abdominal surgery.
Key messages
• Intraoperative GDT using a protocol based on
enhanced hemodynamic variables derived by the Flo￾Trac/Vigileo device reduced the LOS in high-risk
patients undergoing major abdominal surgery com￾pared with a standard management protocol.
• The incidence of complications was reduced in the
enhanced monitoring group.
• No difference between the standard and enhanced
monitoring protocol groups was found with regard
to ICU stay.
