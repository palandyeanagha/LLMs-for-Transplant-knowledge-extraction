Abstract


Aprior phase I/II trial of bortezomib/tacrolimus/methotrexate
prophylaxis after human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched
reduced intensity conditioning allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation documented low acute graft-versus-host disease
incidence, with promising overall and progression-free survival. We
performed an open-label three-arm 1:1:1 phase II randomized
controlled trial comparing grade II–IV acute graft-versus-host
disease between conventional tacrolimus/methotrexate (A) versus
bortezomib/tacrolimus/methotrexate (B), and versus bortezomib/
sirolimus/tacrolimus (C), in reduced intensity conditioning
allogeneic transplantation recipients lacking HLA-matched related
donors. The primary endpoint was grade II–IV acute graft-versus-
host disease incidence rate by day +180. One hundred and thirty-
eight patients (A 46, B 45, C 47) with a median age of 64 years
(range: 24–75), varying malignant diagnoses and disease risk (low
14, intermediate 96, high/very high 28) received 7–8/8 HLA-
mismatched (40) or matched unrelated donor (98) grafts. Median
follow up in survivors was 30 months (range: 14–46). Despite early
immune reconstitution differences, day +180 grade II-IV acute
graft-versus-host disease rates were similar (A 32.6%, B 31.1%, C
21%; P=0.53 for A vs. B, P=0.16 for A vs. C). The 2-year non-
relapse mortality incidence was similar (A 14%, B 16%, C 6.4%;
P=0.62), as were relapse (A 32%, B 32%, C 38%; P=0.74), chronic
graft-versus-host disease (A 59%, B 60% C 55%; P=0.66),
progression-free survival (A 54%, B 52%, C 55%; P=0.95), and
overall survival (A 61%, B 62%, C 62%; P=0.98). Overall, the
bortezomib-based regimens evaluated did not improve outcomes
compared with tacrolimus/methotrexate therapy. clinicaltrials.gov

Introduction
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is
curative in advanced or aggressive hematologic malignancies
despite associated toxicities. While a sibling matched at human
leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1 is optimal, only a
minority of patients who may benefit from HSCT have such a donor
available.1 Utilizing a 7/8 HLA-matched graft increases the
likelihood of obtaining an adult donor for all racial and ethnic


groups,1 but at the expense of worse outcomes. In reduced-intensity
conditioning (RIC) HSCT, retrospective registry studies document
increased rates of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease
(aGvHD) and non-relapse mortality (NRM), with worse progression-
free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for 7/8 vs. 8/8 HLA-
matched donors.2
The proteasome-inhibitor bortezomib (bort) can selectively deplete
proliferating alloreactive T lymphocytes, reduce Th1 cytokines and
Interleukin-6 levels, and block antigen-presenting cell (APC)
activation.63 It can also spare regulatory T cells (Tregs) that are
relevant in GvHD control.7 Administered early after graft infusion,
short-course bort can control GvHD in major histocompatibility
complex (MHC)-mismatched mouse HSCT and maintain graft-versus-
tumor responses,986 while avoiding the pro-inflammatory colonic
toxicity of delayed or prolonged bort.1085
In a phase I/II study of RIC we documented that bort-based GvHD
prophylaxis (bort 1.3 mg/m IV on d +1, +4, +7, plus
conventional tacrolimus [tax] and methotrexate [mtx]) was safe
and potentially efficacious in T-replete HLA-mismatched donor
(MMD) transplantation, with survival comparable to HLA-matched
cohorts.1211 These data were used to support the inclusion of the
bort-based regimen as one novel arm of an ongoing multicenter
phase II randomized trial, comparing it to two other novel
regimens: post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy), and
maraviroc, each compared to a non-randomized ‘conventional care’
cohort (The Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network
[BMTCTN] 1203).
We additionally conducted a phase II randomized control trial
(RCT) for patients lacking 8/8 HLA-matched sibling donors (DFCI
12–404), directly randomizing conventional tac/mtx vs. two novel
bort-based GvHD prophylaxis regimens, whose mature results we
report herein. The regimens comprised bort plus tac/mtx (arm B),
directly based on our phase I/II data; and bort plus sirolimus (sir)/
tac (arm C), to explore the tolerizing effects of enhanced Treg
sparing with combined proteasome- and mechanistic target of
rapamycin (mTOR)-inhibition during early immune
reconstitution.137 We chose bort/sir/tac instead of bort-based


calcineurin inhibitors (CNI)-free prophylaxis (e.g., bort/sir/
mycophenolate mofetil [MMF]) as the sir/MMF doublet has limited
clinical efficacy,14 and in our experience, adding bort to sir/MMF
did not provide adequate efficacy in GvHD prevention, while the
sir/tac doublet has documented efficacy comparable to
conventional tac/mtx.15
Methods
This prospective clinical trial was approved by the institutional
review board of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Harvard Cancer
Center. Written informed consent was obtained prior to patient
enrollment.
Study Design
The study was a one-stage randomized phase II trial with the
primary objective of comparing the incidence of aGvHD in two
bort-based GvHD prophylaxis regimens to conventional tac/mtx.
The study was designed for the primary comparisons of the grade II-
IV aGvHD rates in Arm A vs. B and Arm A vs. C in parallel, and was
powered to test the hypothesis of superiority in Arm B and C (15%),
compared to that in Arm A (40%). The accrual goal was 138
patients, randomizing all eligible patients in 1:1:1 ratio to the three
regimens. Randomization was stratified by degree of HLA-match
(8/8 vs. 7/8).
Patients
Adult hematologic malignancy patients lacking an available HLA-
matched sibling with an available 8/8 (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1)
matched unrelated donor (MUD) or 1-antigen/allele mismatched
related donor (MMRD) or mismatched unrelated donor (MMUD)
were enrolled on the trial between January 2013 and November
2015. Patients with HIV infection, active hepatitis B or C disease,
abnormal renal (serum creatinine > upper limit of normal [ULN]
with clearance <40 mL/min/1.73m2 body surface area [BSA]) or
liver function (serum total bilirubin >ULN, serum alanine/
aspartate aminotransferase >2x ULN), Eastern Cooperative


Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status >2, hyperlipidemia
(serum cholesterol >300mg/dL; trigylcerides >400mg/dL) despite
therapy, and peripheral neuropathy ≥grade 2 within 21 days prior
to transplantation were excluded.
Transplantation
Conditioning comprised busulfan (0.8 mg/kg twice daily IV) and
fludarabine (30 mg/m once daily IV) from days −5 to −2. T-
replete donor peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) dosed at ≥ 2×10
CD34 cells/kg were infused on day 0. GvHD prophylaxis regimens
were: tac/mtx (arm A), bort/tac/mtx (arm B), and bort/sir/tac (arm
C). Dosing was: bort (1.3 mg/m IV on day +1, +4, +7), mtx (10
mg/m IV on day +1, 5 mg/m on day +3, +6, +11), sir (target
trough level 5–12 ng/ml) and/or tac (target trough level 5–10 ng/
ml) from day −3. The tapering of immunosuppression started at
around d+100, with the aim of being off immune suppression (IS)
by day +180, as applicable per treatment arm.
Participants received levetiracetam for seizure prophylaxis from day
−5 to −1 and filgrastim 5 μg/kg daily from day +1 until an
absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >1500 cells/μl was attained, and
at least 12 months of Pneumocystis jiroveci and herpes simplex virus
(HSV)/varicella zoster virus (VZV) prophylaxis. Anti-fungal
prophylaxis was not routine.
Immunophenotyping
CD4 T cells were defined as CD3+CD4; CD8 T cells were defined as
CD3CD8; CD8 naïve cells were defined as CD8CD45RO-CD62L; CD4
Tregs were defined as CD3CD4CD25CD127; CD4 conventional T
cells (Tcons) were defined as CD3CD4CD25CD127; natural killer
(NK) cells as CD56CD3; and B cells as CD19. Aliquots of anti-
coagulated whole blood (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA])
were incubated with fluorophore-conjugated monoclonal
antibodies: anti-CD3 V450 (clone UCHT1, BD Biosciences), anti-CD4
APC-H7 (clone RPA-T4, BD Biosciences), anti-CD8 Pacific-Orange
(clone RPA-T8, Biolegend), anti-CD25 PE-Cy7 (clone M-A251, BD
Biosciences), anti-CD127 PE-Cy5 (clone eBioRDR5, eBioscience) for
T-cell subsets; anti-CD56 PE (clone B159, BD Biosciences), anti-CD3


V450 (clone UCHT1, BD Biosciences) for NK/NKT cells, and anti-
CD19 APC (clone HIB19, BD Biosciences) for B cells. RBC lysis with
BD Pharm Lyse was performed either prior to or following
incubation with conjugated antibodies. Flow cytometry analysis
utilized FACSCanto II (BD Bioscience) or the Fortessa (BD
Bioscience) and FACSDiva software (BD Bioscience). There was a
change in the use of flow cytometry machines over the course of the
study. Both flow cytometers were validated and results were
comparable.
Statistical considerations
The primary endpoint was a grade II-IV aGvHD rate by day 180
after stem cell infusion. Secondary endpoints included cumulative
incidence of aGvHD, NRM, relapse, chronic (c)GvHD, and PFS, OS
and GvHD-free/relapse-free survival (GRFS). The study was
designed for the primary comparisons of the grade II-IV aGvHD
rates in arm A vs. B and arm A vs. C in parallel. We projected the
incidence of grade II-IV aGvHD as 40% in arm A and 15% in arm B
and in arm C. With the sample size of 46 per arm, there is an 80%
power to detect a 25% difference in grade II-IV aGvHD rate
between two arms. This power calculation is based on Fisher’s exact
test at one-sided type I error rate of 0.05. The primary analysis was
performed per the modified intent-to-treat principle (mITT), i.e., all
patients who were randomized and received any amount of the
study treatment were included in the primary analysis. Cumulative
incidence of aGvHD and cGvHD, relapse and NRM were estimated
in the competing risk framework. Relapse with or without death
was considered a competing risk for NRM, and similarly NRM for
relapse. Death or relapse without developing GvHD was a
competing event for GvHD. GvHD incidences occurring after
relapse, in the setting of relapse interventions (e.g.,
immunosuppression [IS] taper, donor lymphocyte infusion [DLI]),
were counted in the estimation of cumulative incidence of GvHD in
order to obtain comprehensive estimates, and both inclusive and
exclusive estimates are presented for aGvHD endpoints. GRFS, PFS
and OS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. GRFS was
defined as the time from stem cell infusion to incidence of grade III/
IV aGvHD, cGvHD requiring systemic immunosuppression agents,
relapse or death, whichever occured first. PFS and OS have been


defined elsewhere. Cumulative incidences in the presence of
competing events were compared using the Gray test, and Kaplan-
Meier estimates were compared using the log-rank test.16 For time-
to-event endpoints, P-values reflect comparing entire distributions
along with point estimates for ease of presentation. For the primary
endpoint, incidence rates of grade II-IV aGvHD by day +180 were
compared at one-sided significance level of 0.05 using Fisher’s exact
test; P-values for secondary endpoints are two-sided at the
significance level of 0.05, without adjusting for multiple
comparisons. Multivariable analysis adjusting for variables, as listed
in Table 1, were performed for OS and PFS using a Cox model, and
a Fine and Gray model was used for grade II-IV aGvHD.17
Immunophenotype data were compared using the Wilcoxon rank-
sum test at each time point without adjusting for multiple
comparisons. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS
version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and R version 3.1.3 (the
CRAN project).

Results
Patient and transplant variables: one hundred and forty-two subjects
enrolled and 138 randomized subjects were evaluable per the
protocol-specified mITT criteria (four cancelled study participation
before receiving transplantation conditioning: two due to acute
infection (one with subsequent disease relapse), one due to provider
preference to continue protocol-excluded medications, and another
due to disease relapse at transplantation admission) (Figure 1). The
treatment arms (A 46, B 45, C 47) were balanced for pre-transplant
variables (Table 1), except lower cytomegalovirus (CMV)
seropositivity in arm C (A, 78.3% vs. B, 77.8% vs. C, 53.2%,
P=0.01). Subjects had a median age of 64 years (range: 24–75),
varying diagnoses (53 acute myeloid leukemia [AML], 33
myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS], 20 non-Hodgkin lymphoma
[NHL], 11 chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL], etc.) and disease-


risk indices (low 14, intermediate 96, high/very high 28). They
received T-replete 8/8 MUD (n=98) or 7/8 MMD (n=40) PBSC
grafts. Median follow up in survivors was 30 months (range: 14–
46).

Engraftment, chimerism, safety: the median time to neutrophil
(>500/μl) and platelet engraftment (>20,000/μl) among patients
who experienced count nadir (i.e., neutrophil count <500/vl and/
or platelet count <20,000/μl) was 11 days (range: 2–45) and 19
days (range: 10–57), respectively, with no significant difference
between treatment arms (P=0.9 and P=0.55 for neutrophils and
platelets, respectively). For the entire cohort, 31% of patients did
not experience count nadir (24% in arm A, 27% in arm B, 43% in
arm C, P=0.11) and no subject failed neutrophil engraftment.
Median total nucleated cell donor chimerism by day 30 was 96%
(range: 42–100) and by day 100 was 97% (range: 0–100, with no
significant difference between treatment arms (P=0.84 and
P=0.83, respectively). The bort-based regimens were well
tolerated. No bort doses were delayed or reduced due to toxicity.
No serious adverse event (SAE) attributable to bort (e.g.,
neuropathy) was documented. Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade ≥3 organ dysfunction (hepatic,
renal, pulmonary) did not differ significantly between treatment
arms, including the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI, 8.7%
overall), thrombotic microangiopathy/hemolytic-uremic syndrome
(TMA/HUS, 6.5% overall) or hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD,
3.3% overall) (P=0.14, P=0.16 and P=0.41, respectively).
Acute GvHD: The primary endpoint of grade II-IV aGvHD incidence
rate by day +180 did not differ significantly between treatment
arms, at 32.6% (A) vs. 31.1% (B, one-sided P=0.53 for arm A vs. B)
vs. 21% (C, one-sided P=0.16 for arm A vs. C) (Table 2). This result
is consistent with the cumulative incidence of aGvHD (P=0.36)
(Table 3, Figure 2A). For seven patients, grade II-IV aGvHD
occurred after hematologic malignancy relapse (six after early IS


taper, and 1 after donor lymphocyte infusions [DLI]). Four of these
(B, 1; C, 3) had aGvHD onset prior to day +180, and are included
in the primary endpoint. This result was consistent with the result
from multivariable analysis: subdistribution hazard ratio (sHR) was
0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42–1.78, P=0.7) for arm B vs.
arm A, and 0.68 (95% CI 0.33–1.4, P=0.29) for arm C vs. arm A. If
patients with aGvHD onset after relapse are excluded from the
analysis, the grade II-IV aGvHD incidence rate by day +180 was
32.6% (A) vs. 28.9% (B, one-sided P=0.44 for arm A vs. B) vs.
14.9% (C, one-sided P=0.04 for arm A vs. C) (Table 2). On
multivariable analysis, sHR was 0.8 (95% CI 0.39–1.66, P=0.55)
for arm B vs. A, and 0.53 (95% CI 0.23–1.18, P=0.12) for arm C vs.
A. aGvHD incidence continued to rise after day +180 across arms,
and the 1-year cumulative incidence of grade II-IV aGvHD was 40%
in arm A, 34% in arm B, and 26% in arm C (P=0.71 for arm A vs.
B, P=0.33 for arm A vs. C) (Figure 2A). For grade III-IV severe
aGvHD, day +180 cumulative incidence was 2.2% (A) vs. 8.9% (B,
P=0.64 for arm A vs. B) vs. 15% (C, P=0.07 for arm A vs. C) (Table
3, Figure 2B).

for comparing the entire distributions was used. *: Acute graft-
versus-host disease (GvHD) after relapse with IS taper included. Tac:
tacrolimus; Mtx: methotrexate; Bort: bortezomib; Sir: sirolimus.


In an exploratory analysis in line with our protocol stratification,
we repeated the analysis by HLA match status (Online Supplementary
Table S1A). For the 8/8 HLA-matched recipients, when all grade II-
IV aGvHD were counted, the six-month cumulative incidence was
33% (A) vs. 16% (B, P=0.1 for arm A vs. B) vs. 19% (C, P=0.21 for
arm A vs. C) (Online Supplementary Figure S1). When arms B and C
were combined, the six-month cumulative incidence was 17%
(P=0.08 for arm A vs. arm B or C). When we repeated the analysis
after excluding aGvHD that occurred after relapse and IS taper, the
six-month cumulative incidence was 33% (A) vs. 13% (B, P=0.046
for arm A vs. B) vs. 16% (C, P=0.13 for arm A vs. C). When arms B
and C were combined, the cumulative incidence was 15% (P=0.03
for arm A vs. arm B or C). However, for 7/8 MMD recipients such a
benefit was not appreciable (albeit with limited sample size) (Online
Supplementary Table S1A, Online Supplementary Figure S1).
NRM, relapse, chronic GvHD, and survival: NRM did not differ
significantly between treatment arms (Table 3), with a 2-year
cumulative incidence of 14% (A, 95% CI, 5–26) vs. 16% (B, 95% CI,
7–29) vs. 6.4% (C, 95% CI, 1.6–16; P=0.62) (Figure 2C). Relapse
did not differ significantly between treatment arms, with a 2-year
cumulative incidence of 32% (A, 95% CI, 18–46) vs. 32% (B, 95%
CI, 19–47) vs. 38% (C, 95% CI, 24–52; P=0.74) (Figure 2D). The 2-
year cumulative incidence of cGvHD did not differ significantly
between treatment arms, at 59% (A) vs. 60% (B) vs. 55% (C;
P=0.66) (Figure 3A). For five patients, cGvHD occurred after
documented hematologic malignancy relapse (A, 1; B, 2; C, 2) and
these were included in the estimation of cumulative incidence of
cGvHD. Two had early IS taper, none received DLI. The 2-year PFS
did not differ significantly between treatment arms, at 54% (A) vs.
52% (B) vs. 55% (C; P=0.95) (Figure 3B). The 2-year OS did not
differ significantly between treatment arms, at 61% (A) vs. 62% (B)
vs. 62% (C; P=0.98) (Figure 3C). The composite 2-year GRFS
endpoint did not differ significantly between treatment arms, at
11% (A) vs. 12% (B) vs. 8% (C; P=0.53) (Figure 3D).

Immune reconstitution: The median total CD3 T-cell count/μl at one
month after transplantation was 401 in arm A (Q1-Q3, 248–681) vs.
414 in arm B (Q1-Q3, 195–898) vs. 190 in arm C (Q1-Q3, 137–340;
P<0.0001), and remained lower in arm C through months two and
three (A, 602 and 728 vs. B, 639 and 571 vs. C, 221 and 269,
respectively; P<0.0001). At six months after transplantation, CD3
T-cell counts were similar in all three arms at 763 (A, Q1-Q3, 463–
1120) vs. 535 (B, Q1-Q3, 333–907) vs. 508 (C, Q1-Q3, 322–728;
P=0.10) (Figure 4A). This reflected both a lower median CD8 and
CD4 T-cell count/μl at one to three months after transplantation in
arm C (P<0.0001, data not shown). Similarly, the median CD19 B-
cell and the median CD56CD3 NK cell count/μl was lower for arm C
during the one to three months following transplantation (P<0.05,
data not shown).

While the total CD4 Tcon cell count/μl at one, two, and three
months after transplantation was lower for arm C (P=0.005,
P=0.0006, P=0.024 at one, two and three months after
transplantation, respectively), the total CD4 Treg cell count/μl was
unimpaired in arm C at those time points, resulting in an improved
ratio of Treg:Tcon reconstitution at one and three months after
transplantation (A: 0.049 and 0.05 vs. B: 0.051 and 0.032 vs. C:


0.088 and 0.067; P=0.006 and P=0.012, respectively) (Figure 4B).
Discussion
Most adult hematologic malignancy patients who may benefit from
allogeneic HSCT lack an available sibling donor and are considered
for a MUD or 1-locus MMD, with umbilical cord blood (UCB) and
haploidentical (haplo) donors being additional alternative options.
Regarding 8/8 MUD, as a result of improvements in DNA-based
typing and supportive care, survival outcomes are considered
similar to those of MRD HSCT,1918 although studies indicate that
MUD HSCT is associated with increased grade II-IV aGvHD (52% vs.
34%), grade III-IV aGvHD (21% vs.16%), and NRM (RR 2.76;
P<0.01).20 The use of 1-locus MMD adds risk. A large registry
analysis of 2,588 patients with acute leukemias, MDS or chronic
myeloid leukemia (CML) undergoing RIC HSCT compared 7/8 with
8/8 HLA-matched donors, and documented higher rates of grade II-
IV aGvHD and NRM, and lower 3-year OS (30% vs. 38%,
respectively; P=0.01) with a mismatched graft.2 Novel regimens to
improve GvHD outcomes for patients lacking a preferred sibling
donor would represent a major advance, and is the focus of our
efforts.
Proteasome inhibition with bort has immunomodulatory properties
relevant to allogeneic HSCT, as previously highlighted. Based on
encouraging phase I/II results in HLA-mismatched T-replete RIC
HSCT, we undertook a prospective randomized evaluation of
aGvHD prophylaxis with conventional tac/mtx (arm A) vs. two
novel regimens of short-course bort for transplantation recipients
lacking 8/8 HLA-matched related donors: bort plus tac/mtx (arm
B), and bort plus sir/tac (arm C).
In our study, Bort, limited to three doses peritransplantation (day
+1, +4 and +7), did not add toxicity. No bort doses were missed
or modified. No subjects developed toxicities of prolonged/delayed
bort administration (e.g., neuropathy, colonic necrosis). Comparing
treatment arms, no increase in hepatic VOD, AKI or TMA/HUS was
noted for bort-based regimens vs. tac/mtx.
Engraftment was rapid and sustained, with robust donor chimerism


by day 30 that was sustained and comparable across treatment
arms. The addition of bort alone did not appear to impair
immunologic recovery, with similar counts of T cells (CD4, CD8), B
cells and NK cells in the conventional tac/mtx vs. bort/tac/mtx
arms. Count recovery for arm C (bort/sir/tac) was lower, as we
previously documented for other sir-based cohorts.10 As
hypothesized, there was relative sparing of Treg reconstitution with
arm C (bort/sir/tac), with no impairment of Treg count recovery
and elevated Treg:Tcon ratios.
The clinical impact of these systematic immunologic differences,
however, remains unclear. Importantly, the 2-year NRM incidence
was low (ranging from 6.4% to 16%) and did not differ significantly
between treatment arms. Relapse was in the expected range after
RIC HSCT (ranging from 24% to 36%), and did not differ
significantly between treatment arms. In this study, survival, while
not differing significantly between treatment arms, with 2-year OS
ranging from 61% to 62% (P=0.98), appeared better than
anticipated for 7/8 and 8/8 HLA-matched recipients, plateauing at
50% and 66%, respectively, in contrast to 1- and 3-year registry
benchmark survivals recently reported for 7/8 and 8/8 donor
recipients, of 48% → 30% and 55%→38%, respectively2. We
highlight a lack of significant difference between treatment arms
with regard to the primary endpoint of grade II-IV aGvHD rate by
day +180.
In the context of delayed T-cell reconstitution noted for arm C, this
suggests that the combination of a CNI (tac) plus mTOR inhibitor
(sir) provides IS without long term tolerizing effects. While it is
possible that longer duration of tac/sir immunosuppression in arm
C beyond day +180 may have better prevented aGvHD, ultimately,
aGvHD deferral rather than long-term amelioration remains a
possibility. In subgroup analysis for the 8/8 HLA-matched
recipients, bort-based regimens had a borderline trend towards
grade II-IV aGvHD benefit vs. tac/mtx, with a cumulative incidence
of 17% vs. 33%, respectively, (P=0.08). However, grade III-IV
severe aGvHD rates were not improved, and for 7/8 MMD grafts a
similar trend for aGvHD benefit of bort-based regimens was not
appreciable, though sample size was limited.


Our trial has strengths due to its appropriate size in the phase II
context, and its direct prospective randomization to conventional
tac/mtx vs. two novel bort-based GvHD prophylaxis regimens.
Concerns regarding open-label treatment assignment are
ameliorated by the minimal dropout rate and the mITT analysis to
further avoid bias, while the ‘hard’ endpoints of GvHD, NRM,
relapse and survival additionally obviate assessment bias concerns.
Our primary finding is that, as tested, bort-based regimens did not
appear to provide additional benefit for grade II-IV aGvHD
prevention in T-replete PBSC RIC HSCT, failing to meet the
protocol-specified 25% reduction in aGvHD incidence for success.
Our phase II RCT requirements for success were stringent, which
limits our ability to detect lower, albeit potentially clinically
meaningful benefit with bort. However, it is also notable that
conventional tac/mtx outcomes were better than anticipated, a
finding similar to that recently reported in other contemporary
randomized HSCT trials.21
These data highlight the inadequacy of non-randomized
comparators for evaluating early phase single arm interventional
studies, and document, as an updated standard, the improved MMD
and MUD RIC HSCT outcomes achievable with conventional tac/
mtx in this study (2-year OS of 58% and 62%, respectively). In the
future, prospective trials of alternative donors (e.g., UCB, haplo)
and novel GvHD prophylaxis regimens (e.g., maraviroc, PTCy) may
need to benchmark these outcomes. In contrast, the bar for the
novel GRFS endpoint appears far lower, ranging from 8% to 12% in
our study, with no significant difference between treatment arms
(P=0.53).
In summary, mature data from this open-label 1:1:1 three-arm
phase II RCT indicates that the bort-based regimens evaluated
appear to provide lower than anticipated grade II-IV aGvHD benefit
compared to conventional tac/mtx in T-replete PBSC RIC HSCT.
While we note the potential benefit of bort for 8/8 HLA-matched
transplants, direct phase III prospective randomization is required
in order to confirm such a benefit. Overall, however, the lack of
benefit for other transplantation outcomes (NRM, relapse, chronic
GvHD, and survival) suggests limited utility for bort prophylaxis in


the doses and combinations assessed. Alternative proteasome
inhibitor combination regimens (e.g., with PTCy) should also be
considered.
