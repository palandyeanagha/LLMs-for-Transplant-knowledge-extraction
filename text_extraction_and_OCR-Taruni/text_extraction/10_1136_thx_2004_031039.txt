Abstract
Among the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, the two entities—
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) characterised by the presence of
the usual interstitial pneumonia pattern of histopathology (IPF/UIP)
and non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP; same nomenclature
for the histopathological pattern and idiopathic disease)—have
provoked considerable debate. IPF/UIP and NSIP closely mimic
each other clinically but NSIP has a far better outcome. However, it
remains unclear if NSIP is a truly separate and distinct entity. The
histopathological pattern of NSIP can be found in a wide variety of
clinical and radiological contexts. This review addresses these and
other uncertainties regarding NSIP and UIP.
