ABSTRACT
Cytomegalovirus (CMV), a ubiquitous human pathogen that is never cleared from the host, has 
long been thought to be relatively innocuous in immunocompetent adults, but causes severe 
complications including blindness, end-organ disease, and death in newborns and in immuno￾compromised individuals, such as organ transplant recipients and those suffering from AIDS. Yet 
even in persons with intact immunity, CMV infection is associated with profound stimulation of 
immune and inflammatory pathways. Carriers of CMV infection also have an elevated risk of de￾veloping cardiovascular complications. In this review, we define the proposed mechanisms of how 
CMV contributes to cardiovascular disease (CVD), describe current approaches to target CMV, 
and discuss how these strategies may or may not alleviate cardiovascular complications in those

with HIV infection receiving antiretroviral therapy, and describe how these 2 viral infections may 
interact to potentiate CVD in this especially vulnerable population.

INTRODUCTION
Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a beta-herpesvirus that is common worldwide, infecting about 
50% of the general population in the United States and in Europe, and is particularly prevalent 
among those who have low socio-economic status or receptive sexual intercourse (women and 
men who have sex with men) [1, 2]. Many adults are initially infected with CMV during child￾hood or early adulthood, and the incidence continues to rise throughout adulthood, by approx￾imately 1% annually [3]. In some resource-poor areas, such as sub-Saharan Africa and parts of 
Asia, CMV infection rates approach 100% [4-6]. Primary CMV infection elicits robust innate and 
adaptive immune responses and can cause a febrile mononucleosis and hepatitis but is subclinical 
for most healthy individuals. Like the other herpesviruses, CMV is never fully cleared from the 
infected host and persists either in a true latent form or in a state of low-level replication made 
possible by multiple immune evasion mechanisms [7]. Reactivations from latency that can lead 
to virus transmission occur periodically and are triggered by various inflammatory stimuli and 
other physiologic stressors; however, they are largely asymptomatic and are mostly self-limited. 
Importantly, and unusually, immunity to CMV does not readily confer protection from super-in￾fection, and secondary infection with other strains of CMV is not uncommon [8-11]. 
Active CMV infections can be identified by the presence of CMV nucleic acids and proteins in 
mucosal secretions. The frequency of CMV DNA shedding in the genital tract and saliva can vary 
substantially across different studies and is strongly dependent on the detection methods and co￾hort characteristics including geographical location [12, 13]. Such asymptomatic CMV shedding 
is important both for horizontal transmission and for the interactions of CMV with co-pathogens, 
adaptive immune responses, and innate immune activation. CMV is a large virus (approximately 
236 kb) and is highly immunogenic—upwards of 10% of all memory T cells may be reactive to 
CMV antigens in persistently-infected individuals [14]—and many viral proteins have evolved to 
combat and evade host immunity [13]. When an infected individual has a compromised immune 
system, shedding of CMV DNA increases dramatically. In individuals who are profoundly immu￾nocompromised (eg, AIDS or after transplant), CMV replication can be uncontrolled and lead to 
end‐organ diseases such as pneumonitis, retinitis, hepatitis, or hemorrhagic colitis [7]. Congenital 
CMV infection is a substantial problem, particularly in resource-limited settings [15, 16], and can 
lead to hearing and vision loss, among other complications [15, 17-19]. 
While long thought to be relatively innocuous in immunocompetent adults, CMV infection is 
becoming more appreciated as an active contributor to a variety of complications. For example, 
in adults, CMV infection is associated with the development of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) 
including atherosclerosis, ischemic heart disease, and myocardial infarction, as well as cardio￾vascular death [20-22]. A recent meta-analysis of 10 prospective studies including over 30,000 
participants determined exposure to CMV was associated with a 22% increased relative risk of 
developing CVD [20], and a comprehensive study of people with HIV infection (PWH) found

that having anti-CMV antibodies (CMV seropositivity) was an independent risk factor for CVD 
and cerebrovascular diseases [23]. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of the 
mechanistic pathways by which CMV infection might promote CVD development in the general 
population, and, as a special case, in PWH. We also describe several innovative strategies to target 
CMV and how they might be applied to reducing CVD onset and severity.
MECHANISTIC LINKS OF CMV TO CVD
Systemic Inflammation 
Persistent systemic inflammation is a risk factor for many complications, including CVD. Indeed, 
several systemic inflammatory mediators, such as high serum or plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-
1b, IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), as well as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor II (TNFR2), 
D-dimer, soluble CD14, and soluble CD163 have been shown to be associated with multiple 
cardiovascular outcomes and/or mortality [24-26]. Recently, in a large study of people at risk for 
CVD, treatment with the IL-1b antagonist canakinumab was shown to reduce systemic inflamma￾tion (ie, IL-6 and CRP levels) and also reduce the frequency of cardiovascular events even without 
lowering circulating lipid concentrations [27, 28]. IL-1b is produced by multiple cell types early 
after CMV infection or injury [29, 30]. While IL-1b can induce CMV reactivation from latency 
in cell culture and in mouse models [31, 32], evidence also suggests that CMV employs several 
mechanisms to counter IL-1b activity—potentially limiting its antiviral effects to allow for more 
robust infection [33-36]. 
IL-6 levels are highly correlated with CVD risk [37-39], and targeting IL-6 activity with tocili￾zumab has been shown to improve indices of endothelial dysfunction in participants at high risk 
for CVD [40, 41]. Acute CMV infection is associated with IL-6 expression both in vitro and in 
vivo [42-45]. During latency, plasma IL-6 levels remain elevated, even in those without active 
CMV replication, suggesting active CMV replication is not necessary for ongoing IL-6 expression 
[46, 47]. Accordingly, inhibiting CMV replication with ganciclovir in CMV seropositive critically 
ill individuals had no effect on IL-6 levels [47]. 
Pharmacologically targeting either IL-1b or IL-6 results in decreased CRP levels, consistent with 
CRP expression being downstream of their activities [27, 28, 48]. CRP can bind to low-density 
lipoproteins (LDL), allowing macrophages to take up the LDL without further modifications such 
as oxidation, and studies have shown increased inflammation following CRP treatment [49-51]. In 
a study of nearly 1000 participants with coronary artery disease, elevated CRP levels coupled with 
CMV seropositivity were associated with mortality, whereas neither elevated CRP levels without 
CMV nor CMV seropositivity without elevated CRP showed such an association [52]. These ob￾servations are consistent with other studies of the links among CMV, CRP, and CVD [53, 54]. 
TNF has been shown to be a major proinflammatory contributor to CVD risk in multiple studies, 
and targeting TNF can alleviate cardiovascular outcomes [55-57]. Much like for IL-1b, levels of 
TNF and CMV are associated [58], and TNF can induce CMV reactivation from cell lines [32, 58, 
59]. However, CMV infection can impair TNF signaling in vitro [36, 60]. Thus, it is possible that 
while CMV limits TNF activity within infected cells to support its pathogenesis, continued TNF 
release from infected cells and from nearby cells during ongoing CMV replication leads to TNF 
accumulation in plasma [61]. Levels of the soluble TNF receptors TNFR1 and TNFR2 are surro-

gate markers of TNF activity in vivo [62], and their levels are linked to cardiovascular outcomes, 
including in PWH [25, 63]. As discussed in more detail below, we found that CMV infection was 
associated with elevated levels of soluble TNFR2 in PWH compared to CMV-uninfected PWH 
[64], and a small interventional study demonstrated that inhibiting CMV replication with val￾ganciclovir resulted in a significant reduction in plasma levels of soluble TNFR2 in PWH [65]. 
Taken together, these data from multiple studies suggest that CMV infection (and likely con￾tinued low-level viral replication) is a critical determinant of persistent systemic inflammation, 
especially in those who are at risk of developing inflammation and CVD from other factors. 
Monocyte Activation
The stimulatory effect of CMV infection on the activity of immune cells has been well document￾ed [66, 67]. Myeloid cells, including monocytes and macrophages, have long been known to be 
major contributors to CVD, and myeloid cells are some of the most abundant cells within plaque 
tissues [68, 69]. In atherosclerosis, monocytes enter the nascent plaque from the circulation where 
they encounter proinflammatory cytokines, take up oxidized lipoproteins via scavenger receptors, 
and differentiate into cholesterol-laden foam cells [70]. The combination of infiltration and cell 
retention results in macrophage accumulation in the plaques. 
The latent CMV reservoir is retained mainly within CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells—including 
monocyte precursor cells—in the bone marrow [71-73]. Circulating monocytes harbor latent 
CMV that turns on viral gene expression upon differentiation into tissue macrophages [66]. The 
proinflammatory microenvironment in the developing plaque may thus induce CMV replica￾tion, because in vitro experiments have demonstrated that endothelial cell (EC) co-culture and 
oxidized LDL (oxLDL) can synergistically induce CMV gene expression [66]. CMV infection 
reciprocally promotes expression of the scavenger receptor CD36 and enhances oxLDL uptake in 
a monocyte/macrophage cell line [74]. CMV infection also increases production of IL-1β, IL-18, 
TNF, and interferon (IFN)-g by infected monocytes and macrophages in vitro [61, 75]. These 
phenomena are of particular interest because of the proatherogenic effects of these cytokines in 
atherosclerosis. Mechanistically, CMV could promote early atherogenesis through direct effects 
on CMV-laden monocytes as they enter the nascent plaque, release proinflammatory cytokines, 
acquire oxidized lipoproteins, and differentiate into foam cells. 
Intriguingly, CMV encodes several chemokine receptor homologs that induce signaling path￾ways in the infected cell. One of these is US28, a G-protein-coupled receptor that can bind to the 
chemokines CCL2, CCL5, CCL7, and CX3CL1, and which may contribute to the development of 
CMV-associated CVD [76, 77]. The binding of US28 to CX3CL1, also known as fractalkine, may 
be particularly important. CX3CL1 is abundantly expressed by vascular ECs, is upregulated by 
inflammation, is detected in atherosclerotic plaque tissues, and mediates both cell adhesion and 
chemotaxis of cells that express the fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) [78, 79]. In addition, CX3CL1 
binding to US28 induces macrophage migration [80]. As US28 expression is also necessary for 
the maintenance of CMV latency [81], circulating monocytes harboring latent CMV should have 
constitutive expression of US28. Thus, it is conceivable that latently infected cells might be more 
susceptible to the influence of CX3CL1 signals and traffic more readily to sites of endothelial dys￾function, such as atherosclerotic plaques. As the infected monocyte is activated and differentiates, 
CMV could reactivate from its latent state, spread to surrounding ECs and smooth muscle cells,

and further potentiate atherogenesis. 
T-cell Stimulation 
Primary CMV infection drives expansion of CMV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells. The function￾ality of these cells, and ultimately their capacity to prevent CMV recurrence, can be predicted 
by their expression of transcription factors, including T-bet and eomesodermin [82, 83]. Un￾like many other viral infections in which the T-cell response is substantially reduced during the 
contraction phase and is maintained as a low-level memory response, latent CMV infection often 
drives the continued expansion of activated T cells, a process known as memory inflation. In hu￾mans, this phenomenon can result in a surprisingly large proportion of all memory T cells being 
specific for CMV antigens, upwards of 10% in the general population and even higher in PWH 
and the elderly [14, 84-86]. Although these CMV-specific T cells retain their functionality, and 
are not exhausted per se, they are incapable of either clearing CMV infection from the body or 
preventing CMV superinfections. 
CD4 and CD8 T cells that express the fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) have been associated with 
adverse cardiovascular outcomes [87-90]. As described above, fractalkine (CX3CL1) may drive 
the infiltration and retention of T cells, other CX3CR1+ cells (ie, macrophages and NK cells), 
and CMV-infected cells expressing US28 into the plaques where they may colocalize at sites of 
EC activation, interact, and contribute to atherogenesis [78-80]. We have recently shown that 
CMV infection is associated with an increase in the proportion of peripheral blood T cells that 
expresses CX3CR1 [91], and we and others have shown that CMV-specific CD8 T cells are en￾riched for CX3CR1 expression [91-94]. CX3CR1+ CD8 T cells are potent effector cells; they are 
enriched for the cytolytic enzymes granzyme B (GzB) and perforin [94, 95] and for production 
of IFN-g and TNF following T-cell receptor (TCR)-mediated stimulation [93]. TNF release may 
be an important link between CMV-specific CX3CR1+ T cells and CVD: we have shown that 
TCR-activated CX3CR1+ CD8 T cells can induce the procoagulant tissue factor (TF) on the 
surface of monocytes in a TNF-dependent manner [96], and TF-expressing monocytes have been 
shown to promote coagulopathy in a non-human primate model of HIV infection [97]. Although 
less abundant than their CD8 T-cell counterparts, CX3CR1+ CD4 T cells are also enriched for 
TNF production [98-100], and our group recently demonstrated that CX3CR1+ CD4 T cells can 
migrate toward TNF-activated EC in vitro in a CX3CL1-dependent manner [101]. Accordingly, 
CMV-specific CD4 T cells in general [102], and CMV-specific CX3CR1+ CD4 T cells in partic￾ular [99], have been linked to increased carotid intima media thickness in PWH. Furthermore, 
T cells from CMV seropositive donors provoke endothelial damage, and EC upregulation of 
adhesive proteins and CX3CL1 [103, 104]. Thus, it is plausible that CMV infection results in an 
immune environment that is primed to exacerbate CVD via trafficking of CX3CR1+ T cells to 
sites of endothelial dysfunction, which are enriched in CX3CL1. The T cells can mediate further 
damage to the endothelium via cytokine and lytic granule release and interact with colocalized 
cells such as monocytes to initiate inflammatory and coagulation pathways. Whether these in￾teractions and subsequent atherogenesis require specific recognition of CMV peptides is unclear, 
but evidence suggests that CMV nucleic acids and proteins are abundant in plaque tissues (see 
below). Following this, it is unclear if the cell-mediated mechanisms that may promote cardiovas￾cular risk in CMV seropositive individuals are fundamentally different than those found in CMV 
seronegative people, or if they are just more abundant.

CMV and Endothelium
The importance of the endothelium in the development and progression of atherosclerosis has 
long been recognized [105]. The condition of the endothelium determines the adhesive status of 
the vessel, vessel tone and permeability, the possibility for thrombus formation, and other fea￾tures. The endothelial state can in turn correlate with the clinical complications of atherosclerosis 
[106-110]. Smoking, severe mental stress with high catecholamine emission, hemodynamic forc￾es, oxLDL, IFNg, TNF, and other factors can influence the health and function of the endothelium 
[111-116].
Numerous studies have revealed that CMV infection is a key determinant of endothelial status. 
Direct CMV infection causes vascular EC injury [117, 118], enhancing adhesiveness, and EC 
damage caused by CMV leads to the synthesis and expression of CX3CL1, intercellular adhesion 
molecule (ICAM)-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM), von Willebrand factor (vWF), and 
other molecules [119-123]. CMV infection also results in EC apoptosis and downregulation of 
endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression [104, 119, 121, 122, 124], which may explain 
the experimentally impaired endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent arterial 
vasodilation driven by CMV [125, 126]. Thus, CMV infection increases the permeability of the 
endothelium, the recruitment and trans-endothelial migration of monocytes [117], and possibly 
of CX3CR1+ T cells. CMV has recently been shown to affect the expression of matrix metallo￾proteinases in endothelial and smooth muscle cells, influencing atherosclerotic plaque stability 
[61, 75, 127]. Moreover, CMV infection-associated inflammation leads to an imbalance in the 
thrombogenic/antithrombogenic function of the endothelium, increasing platelet adhesion to the 
endothelium as well as the risk of thrombus formation [122, 128]. 
That CMV directly infects the vascular walls in vivo has been demonstrated in clinical studies of 
individuals suffering from inflammatory eye diseases [129]. CMV seropositivity has been linked 
to impaired vascular function, assessed from response to bradykinin [130] and brachial artery 
flow-mediated dilation (FMD) [131], but these results are somewhat controversial [132, 133]. In a 
study of children after heart transplantation, detectable CMV DNA in peripheral blood cells was 
associated with a significant impairment in FMD [134]. CMV infection in adult heart transplant 
recipients was associated with impaired endothelial function, assessed from coronary flow re￾serve [135]. These effects might be due in part to modulation of eNOS activity by CMV infection. 
Specifically, CMV infection results in an elevated level of asymmetric dimethylarginine (an endog￾enous eNOS inhibitor), which abolishes eNOS activation, in the serum of heart transplant patients 
[136]. Endothelial function was also assessed from angiography in coronary artery atherosclerosis 
patients with different titers of IgG antibodies against the coronary artery disease-related infec￾tions CMV, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis A virus, and herpes simplex 
virus (HSV)-1. Simultaneous detection of antibodies against several pathogens significantly 
correlated with deteriorated endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasodilation 
in tests using adenosine and acetylcholine in both patients with atherosclerosis and volunteers 
[137]. In our recent study, we analyzed productive CMV infection using detection of CMV DNA 
in blood plasma of individuals with acute myocardial infarction and volunteers without CVD. We 
found a significantly higher frequency of presence and load of CMV DNA in patients with acute 
myocardial infarction than in controls [138]. Furthermore, when we assessed endothelial function 
in these patients, we for the first time showed a significant negative correlation between CMV 
DNA in plasma and the results of the FMD test in patients with acute myocardial infarction [139].

Pathogens and Immunity - Vol 5, No 1 246
CMV infection is also closely related to increased production of the proinflammatory cytokine 
IL-15, which also activates T cells, enhances mitochondrial activity, and promotes the intracellu￾lar accumulation of cytolytic molecules such as GzB and perforin, as shown in our studies and in 
those of others [91, 101, 140-142]. In our recent report investigating the role of CMV infection on 
the development of CD57+ CD4 memory T cells, we found that IL-15 treatment in vitro upreg￾ulated intracellular GzB and perforin and surface expression of CX3CR1 by both CD57+ and 
CD57- CD4 memory T cells, but more so for CD57+ cells [101]. IL-15 has also been shown to 
promote the maintenance of CMV-specific inflationary memory T cells in a mouse model [142], 
and it has been linked to cardiovascular disease—serum IL-15 levels are elevated in patients 
with coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, and hypertension compared to controls 
[143, 144]. In addition, IL-15 is induced by a Western diet and exacerbates atherosclerotic lesion 
development in the LDL receptor knockout mouse model [145]. IL-15 protein is detected within 
atherosclerotic plaques in mice and humans, seemingly colocalized with macrophages [146, 147], 
and we recently showed that oxLDL exposure can trigger IL-15 production by monocytes in vitro 
[148]. Thus, IL-15 is a likely contributor to CVD, and the pathways that drive its expression in 
CMV seropositive individuals require further exploration. 
As described above, CMV infection of the endothelium triggers active recruitment of peripheral 
mononuclear cells [117, 124], as well as the transfer of CMV antigens to T cells via exosome-like 
extracellular particles [149]. Therefore, it has been suggested that CMV infection of the endothe￾lium results in secretion of viral proteins and mature viral particles, which are then presented by 
the neighboring ECs to smooth muscle cells [150]. As a result, chemokines actively recruit my￾eloid cells and T cells to the endothelium, leading to perpetuation of inflammation in the plaques 
and atherosclerosis progression. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) significantly increase in myocardial 
infarction [151]; this may be one of the mechanisms allowing CMV to spread among endothelial 
and immune cells. Over the last few years, the transfer of virus-derived genetic material between 
cells by EVs has been reported, which in some cases promoted further infection of the target cells 
with mature viral particles [152, 153] or even resulted in productive infection mediated by EVs 
[154, 155]. A similar mechanism has been examined in detail for the transmission of HIV, influ￾enza virus, hepatitis B and C viruses, HSV-1, and HSV-2 [156], and recently the same pathway 
was demonstrated for CMV transfer in blood [150]. Furthermore, statins, which significantly de￾crease EV shedding in blood [157], can also suppress production of CMV DNA in cultured cells 
[158] and abolish the effect of CMV on the expansion of atherosclerosis in mice [159], supporting 
a role for EVs in CMV production and shedding. 
ANIMAL MODELS
Human CMV is highly species-specific, so current animal models of CMV infections and patho￾physiology utilize related viruses. Indeed, much of the foundational animal work linking CMV 
and CVD has been performed in rat models. In a model of photochemically-induced femoral 
artery injury, rats infected with CMV at the time of injury or 2 weeks later exhibited increase 
media or neointima thickness, respectively, consistent with the interpretation that CMV infec￾tion stimulates cell proliferation in the vasculature [160]. Lemstrom and colleagues reported that 
CMV infection early after aortic allograft transplantation accelerated atherosclerosis development 
[161], which could be delayed by ganciclovir administration [162]. In a subsequent study, acute 
CMV infection was associated with significant EC proliferation and increased intimal thicken-

Pathogens and Immunity - Vol 5, No 1 247
ing, and mononuclear cell infiltrates around CMV-infected cardiac allografts exhibited both early 
and late CMV antigen expression [163]. Murine CMV has also been shown to be associated with 
CVD—in fact, mice latently infected with CMV demonstrate vascular dysfunction, particularly as 
the mice age [126]—and atherosclerotic lesions in CMV-infected apolipoprotein E (ApoE) knock￾out mice are larger and more advanced than those in uninfected ApoE knockout controls [164]. 
Monkey studies of CMV pathogenesis, which might be most informative given the similarity to 
human physiology, are unfortunately hindered by the high prevalence of CMV infections in most 
non-human primate colonies. 
CMV AND HIV — A SPECIAL CASE
Although CMV and HIV are very different at the molecular level, both viruses persist lifelong, 
and almost all individuals infected with HIV are also infected with CMV (>90%). However, un￾like CMV, which has been infecting humans since our species arose, HIV is a far younger virus, 
infecting humans for only the past hundred years or so, and currently an estimated 40 million 
people are living with HIV infection worldwide. In the absence of therapy, infection with HIV-1 
results in a progressive loss of immune function marked by depletion of CD4 T cells, leading to 
opportunistic infections and malignancies characteristic of AIDS. Before the advent of antiretro￾viral therapy (ART), CMV disease was the most common viral complication of AIDS, leading to 
devastating blindness in many PWH. The introduction of ART in 1995–1996 profoundly reduced 
the incidence of AIDS-related CMV end-organ diseases [165]. Notably, the substantial overlap 
between the HIV epidemic and CMV prevalence does not appear to be coincidental. In addition 
to having similar risk factors for acquisition, accumulating data show that HIV and CMV infec￾tions enhance each other’s pathogenesis not only by facilitating replication and transmission but 
also by exacerbating comorbidities, including CVD [12, 23]. 
In a large longitudinal study of PWH with (n=5119) or without (n=992) CMV coinfection, CMV 
seropositivity was linked to an increased risk of adverse clinical events, and the cardiovascular 
outcomes were the most frequent events associated with CMV [23]. HIV infection is also associ￾ated with elevated levels of systemic inflammatory mediators (such as IL-6 and interferon-induc￾ible protein [IP]-10) and with chronic immune activation, as evidenced by persistently activated 
platelets, monocytes, and T cells [166]. The extent to which these effects are due to HIV infection, 
or are due to coinfections such as CMV, is not known. That CMV infection does contribute is 
clear however, as we and others have shown that CMV seronegative PWH lack the HIV-associat￾ed CD8 T-cell expansion [64, 167] and have significantly reduced plasma levels of IP-10, soluble 
TNFR2, and D-dimer compared to CMV seropositive PWH [64]. 
STRATEGIES TO TARGET CMV
Antiviral Drugs
Since CMV infection is a major complication in immunosuppressed individuals, targeting CMV 
with antivirals has been tried in several clinical settings, including in allogeneic hematopoiet￾ic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients and in PWH, but any cardiovascular benefits of these 
treatments are unclear. A randomized controlled study showed reductions in CMV shedding 
and in CD8 T-cell activation when PWH were treated for just 8 weeks with the anti-CMV drug 
valganciclovir [168]. Because this trial was small (n=30) and of relatively short duration, analysis 

www.PaiJournal.com
Pathogens and Immunity - Vol 5, No 1 248
of CVD outcomes was not possible, although soluble TNFR2 levels, which are associated with 
cardiovascular outcomes in PWH [25], were reduced following valganciclovir treatment [65]. 
Letermovir is a CMV DNA terminase complex inhibitor that is FDA-approved for prophylaxis 
of CMV infection and disease in adult CMV-seropositive allogeneic HSCT recipients [169-171]. 
Letermovir has superb antiviral activity against CMV with an excellent safety profile and little 
cross-resistance with other antivirals. Letermovir demonstrated significant benefit compared 
to placebo measured by time to clinically significant CMV disease post-HSCT (18.9% vs 44.3% 
cumulative rate; stratified log-rank test, 2-sided P-value <0.0001). Overall, letermovir has shown 
promising clinical efficacy and is generally well tolerated, thus providing a favorable new option 
in the prophylaxis of CMV infection and disease. Some limitations of letermovir are that the drug 
has no significant activity against other herpesvirus or non-human CMV, and it has a relatively 
low barrier for resistance. Our group is currently developing a clinical trial to test the safety and 
antiviral efficacy of letermovir in CMV-seropositive PWH. Although this trial will not be pow￾ered to detect if letermovir treatment reduces CVD, we plan to measure indices of arterial inflam￾mation and levels of CVD risk biomarkers, including soluble TNFR2, which is strongly linked to 
cardiovascular outcomes and to CMV coinfection in PWH [25]. 
Adoptive Cell Therapies
One of the most exciting areas of current research is the development of adoptive cell therapies. 
This term encompasses a wide range of clinical approaches that span from HSCT to the more 
recent developments of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. In addition to its benefits for 
treating malignancies, HSCT is the only strategy that has resulted in functional cure of HIV infec￾tion [172, 173]. However, given the inherent dangers in the procedure and the lack of scalability, 
HSCT is unlikely to be a widely applied strategy for treatment of any viral infection, especially one 
as prevalent as CMV. In that sense, more directed approaches, such as CAR T and CAR NK cells, 
are more promising. CAR cells express engineered transmembrane constructs that contain the an￾tigen-binding variable portion of an antibody extracellularly (to confer specificity) and the CD3z 
signaling portion of a TCR receptor intracellularly (to confer functionality), often with additional 
costimulatory elements included, thereby allowing the engineered cell to bypass traditional TCR￾MHC restrictions [174, 175]. CAR T cells that have specificity for CMV glycoprotein B (gB) have 
been developed and seem to limit CMV infection in vitro and in a humanized mouse model by 
cytokine release but not cytotoxicity [176-179]. Unfortunately, CAR T cells carry considerable 
risk, including that of cardiovascular complications [180, 181], and so it is unlikely anyone but the 
most vulnerable would be eligible for adoptive cell therapy with CMV-specific CAR T cells. 
Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy is another exciting area of advancement in cancer treatment that is being applied 
for infectious diseases. While the term “immunotherapy” refers to any agent that targets the host 
response as opposed to the tumor or pathogen (such as with chemotherapy or antivirals), most 
often the term is used to described therapies (usually antibodies) that inhibit components of 
immune checkpoint pathways. The FDA has approved immunotherapy regimens that target the 
immune checkpoint molecules programmed death (PD)-1, PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1), and cytotoxic 
T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), alone or in combination, and therapies that target 
other pathways are currently in development [182, 183]. Many CMV-reactive T cells express PD-

1, although their functionality does not seem to be impaired [100, 184]. In general, these therapies 
inhibit the molecular pathways that actively limit T-cell function. Unfortunately, immunotherapy 
can also lead to considerable immune-related adverse events [185], and as with adoptive cell ther￾apy, it is unlikely that immunotherapy against CMV will gain widespread use in healthy individu￾als. However, when someone who is CMV seropositive requires immunotherapy, it is possible that 
anti-CMV activity could be a welcome ‘side-effect’ of treatment, ie, PD-1 blockade could poten￾tially license T cells to kill CMV-infected monocytes that they might otherwise ignore.
We should note that CMV encodes some of its own inhibitory agents that are potentially targets 
for immunotherapy. For instance, the viral UL18 protein is a homolog of class I major histocom￾patibility complex (MHC-I) molecules and can inhibit the function of cells that express the leuko￾cyte Ig-like receptor, subfamily B (LILRB)-1 protein [186]. LILRB-1 expression is found on about 
half of the CMV-specific CD8 T cells, and blocking LILRB-1 activity increases IFN-g production 
[187]. Since LILRB-1 binds UL18 with more than 1000-fold higher affinity than host MHC-I 
molecules [188], UL18 expressed by CMV-infected cells could be a potent inhibitor of immune 
responses in vivo [189]. Therefore, blocking LILRB-1/UL18 interactions might confer anti-CMV 
specificity with limited immunopathology and be a useful strategy to target CMV and its associat￾ed comorbidities. 
CMV Vaccines
The development of a CMV vaccine is a top priority due to its potential cost-effectiveness and 
associated public health benefits. Prophylactic vaccines might prevent the acquisition of CMV in￾fection, thereby reducing overall infectious burden, and therapeutic vaccines might reduce reac￾tivation from latency, virus shedding and transmission, and CMV-associated morbidities such as 
CVD. However, there are many challenges facing vaccine development including (1) complex im￾mune evasion mechanisms, (2) unclear immune correlates of protection, and (3) a narrow range 
of CMV hosts which limits the value of animal models. In spite of these limitations, several types 
of CMV vaccine candidate, including live-attenuated, DNA, vectored, and peptide vaccines, have 
been developed or are currently under development, and have been reviewed in detail elsewhere 
[190, 191]. Recently, a modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA)-based vaccine (Triplex), which encodes 
3 full-length CMV antigens—pp65 (UL83), IE1-exon4 (UL123), IE2-exon5 (UL122)—obtained 
excellent safety and immunostimulatory results in a phase 1 trial with healthy adults [192] and in 
a phase 2 trial of over 100 adult HSCT recipients at high risk for CMV reactivation [193]. A ran￾domized placebo-controlled clinical trial to test the safety and efficacy of Triplex in PWH is being 
developed by our group. While the trial will not be powered to assess clinical outcomes such as a 
reduction in cardiovascular outcomes, we plan to measure whether vaccination elicits changes in 
plasma levels of soluble inflammatory markers associated with CVD. 
Cardiovascular Benefits of Anti-CMV Therapies
Most of the focus of anti-CMV therapies has understandably been to prevent acute congenital 
and transplant-associated infections, as these situations represent the most immediate need for 
interventions. However, given the association of CMV infection and cardiovascular risk, it is 
tempting to consider CMV as a target for novel strategies to treat and/or reduce CVD. The high 
prevalence of CMV within atherosclerotic plaques of patients undergoing endarterectomy [138, 
194, 195], suggests that active CMV replication might be a contributor to plaque development

and/or stability. Thus, these approaches could have a direct positive effect by protecting the vascu￾lar endothelium and smooth muscle cells that become infected with CMV. Alternatively, target￾ing CMV could have an indirect effect by reducing the proinflammatory milieu that is central to 
CVD risk. Of course, these outcomes are not mutually exclusive, and it may be a combination of 
these effects that ultimately proves protective. As CVD is already the leading cause of mortality 
worldwide [196], and expected to increase in prevalence [197], finding novel targets to alleviate 
disease burden is critical. Targeting CMV infection just might serve as such an opportunity. 
CMV AS VACCINE VECTOR 
In addition to the advancements in anti-CMV drugs, vaccines, and other therapeutic approaches, 
another promising area of research has been to utilize CMV as a vaccine vector. This is an ap￾pealing strategy for a number of reasons, including its robust immunostimulatory potential, its 
lifelong persistence, and its ability to resist immune clearance in CMV-infected hosts [198, 199]. 
Indeed, preclinical studies have demonstrated that CMV vectors are highly efficacious against 
challenge with a wide array of pathogens including viruses (SIV), bacteria (Mycobacterium tuber￾culosis), parasites (Plasmodium knowlesi), and even cancers [200-207]. Current efforts are under￾way to translate this technology for safe usage in human trials [199, 206, 208, 209]. This potent 
vaccine efficacy seems to be linked to the development of vaccine antigen-specific effector mem￾ory CD8 T cells, as opposed to antibody or central memory T-cell responses [200, 210], a finding 
that is consistent with the important role of CD8 T-cell surveillance in limiting superinfections 
with CMV [211]. Interestingly, much of the vaccine efficacy seems to be due to the elicitation of 
CD8 T cells that recognize nonclassical MHC-E alleles [212], and how these observations will 
manifest in human studies remains to be seen. Nevertheless, caution must be taken to ensure that 
recipients of CMV-based vaccine constructs do not acquire increased risk of developing cardio￾vascular complications. 
CONCLUSION 
Although traditional risk factors (smoking, diabetes, etc.) are certainly important drivers of CVD, 
it is becoming increasingly evident that persistent CMV infection is a contributor to a variety of 
cardiovascular complications, even in individuals without overt virus expression. Asymptomatic 
reactivation from latency is likely far more common than appreciated and promotes inflamma￾tion and activation of T cells and monocytes. Early in life, this response is possibly protective—
evidence suggests latent CMV infection may promote influenza vaccine efficacy and clearance 
of bacterial coinfections [213, 214]—yet over time, this benefit is lost and the CMV-associated 
inflammation proves detrimental. When coupled with direct infection of vascular endothelial 
and smooth muscle cells, CMV becomes a key factor in cardiovascular pathogenesis. Given the 
high prevalence of latent CMV infection worldwide, innovative strategies to target the virus, like 
those described in this review, may be instrumental in helping to alleviate the tremendous bur￾den of CVD.
