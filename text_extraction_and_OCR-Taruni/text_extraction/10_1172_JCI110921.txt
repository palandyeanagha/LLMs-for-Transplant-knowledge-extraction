A B S T R A C T Papillary and surface micropuncture
were used to study the handling of ammonium and
the formation of net acid by surface nephrons, deep
nephrons, and the terminal segment of collecting duct
(CD) after renal mass was reduced by two-thirds. Net
acid excretion by the remnant kidney (RK) was sig￾nificantly reduced, averaging 794±81 neq/min (SE)
compared with 1,220±105 neq/min after sham op￾eration (P < 0.001), due to a decrease in ammonium
excretion (494±54 vs. 871±79 nmol/min in controls,
P < 0.001). Urinary pH and titratable acid excretion
were not different in the two groups of animals. After
RK formation, ammonium delivery to the end of the
proximal tubule increased nearly threefold and aver￾aged 66.2±5.6 compared with 18.4±2.9 pmol/min in
controls, (P < 0.001). This greater delivery of am￾monium was primarily due to renal tubule entry rather
than to changes in the filtered load and was only par￾tially related to the differences in flow rate. Ammo￾nium processing by deep nephrons was profoundly
affected by a reduction in renal mass. Although ab￾solute delivery of ammonium was greater to the bend
of Henle's loop (BHL), the difference could be ac￾counted for on the basis of an increase in nephron size.
Thus, fractional delivery (FDNH4) to this site was not
different for the two groups of animals, averaging
1,567±180% in controls and 1,400±181% in the group

with the RK. Hydrogen secretion in the proximal seg￾ments of deep and surface nephrons did not increase
in proportion to the decrease in renal mass and as a
consequence bicarbonate delivery to the end of the
proximal tubule of surface nephrons and to the BHL
of deep nephrons was increased.
When renal mass was reduced FDNH. to the base of
the terminal CD doubled but did not change by the
tip. In both groups FDNI4+ to the base of the CD was
greater than to the end of the distal tubule. However,
the increase was the same. On the other hand, the
increase in the net acid index between the end of the
distal tubule and the base of the CD was profoundly
greater in rats with an RK. This difference was pri￾marily due to bicarbonate reabsorption rather than
enhanced ammonium reentry. Indeed, >400% of the
fractional ammonium delivered to the end of the prox￾imal tubule was lost from the tubule fluid. The data
suggest that the decrease in acid excretion by the RK
is due to two factors. First, hydrogen secretion in the
proximal segments of both nephron populations fails
to increase in the proportion to the reduction in renal
mass. Second, a reduced reentrapment of ammonia,
rather than its impaired production, causes ammonium
excretion to decrease.
INTRODUCTION
One early consequence of a reduction in renal mass
is the development of a metabolic acidosis, a reflection
of the inability of the residual nephrons to excrete the
hydrogen ion generated through the metabolic deg￾radation of dietary protein (1-4). At least two different
mechanisms are responsible for this altered acid ex￾J. Clin. Invest. © The American Society for Clinical Investigation, Inc. - 0021-9738/83/06/1661/15 $1.00 1661

cretion. First, it appears that secretion of hydrogen ion
in the proximal tubule, as it relates to bicarbonate reab￾sorption, fails to keep pace with the increase in the
filtered load of bicarbonate per nephron that occurs
as renal function declines. This suggestion is supported
by whole kidney clearance studies in humans (4, 5)
and experimental animals (6-8) with reduced renal
function, and appears to be a consequence of uremia
per se, since the diseased kidney functioning in the
presence of the contralateral control kidney (CK)l does
not "waste" bicarbonate (6, 9). The micropuncture
studies of Lubowitz et al. (6) have implicated the prox￾imal tubule in this altered reabsorption of bicarbonate.
However, beyond these studies, the handling of bi￾carbonate by the various nephron segments of the
chronically diseased kidney have not been assessed. No
information is available concerning the role of the
proximal segments of deep nephrons in bicarbonate
reclamation in the setting of reduced renal mass.
The second mechanism operative in the metabolic
acidosis of uremia is the reduced excretion of am￾monium (4, 10-13). In humans (4, 11, 12) and in an￾imals (14-17) with reduced renal mass, ammonium
excretion does not increase appropriately when an acid
load is administered chronically or when the substrate
for ammonia production, glutamine, is given (13).
Although ammonium excretion seems to bear a pro￾portional relationship to the degree of reduction in
nephron mass (11, 12), there is evidence that an adap￾tive increase occurs. Studies of unilateral renal disease
have shown that the excretion of ammonium by the
diseased kidney is similar to that of the contralateral
kidney when factored by glomerular filtration rate
(GFR) (9, 16). However, when the normal functioning
kidney is removed (9, 16), ammonium excretion/100
ml of GFR by the remnant kidney (RK) increases sig￾nificantly. Similarly, several investigators have shown
that ammonium excretion per nephron is increased in
this setting (15-17). Finkelstein and Hayslett (15) have
reported a more profound decrease in ammonium and
titratable acid excretion in rats after papillectomy than
after partial renal ablation. These data suggest that
papillary structures play an important role in the ex￾cretion of buffered acids. Except for these observations
no studies have been performed that are directed to￾ward the specific nephron site or sites where altered
ammonium handling occurs after renal mass is re￾duced.
Recently, we (18, 19) and others (20) have provided
evidence, using micropuncture techniques, suggesting

that ammonium production occurs primarily in the
proximal segments of surface and deep nephrons. That
ammonium leaves surface nephrons between the end
of the proximal and distal tubule to become reen￾trapped along the medullary collecting duct (CD) (18-
21). Thus, it would appear that the process of acidif￾cation involves two steps, either of which might be
affected by a reduction in renal mass. This study was
therefore designed to characterize the relative contri￾bution of deep and surface nephrons of the RK to the
process of net acid formation and ammonium pro￾duction and to determine whether the reduction in
ammonium excretion seen after renal mass is reduced
is due to decreased production in the proximal seg￾ments of these two nephron populations or to a failure
to reentrap ammonia along the terminal nephron and
the CD.
METHODS
Approximately 14 d before study, 21 Munich-Wistar rats
weighing 60-70 g were lightly anesthetized with ether. The
left kidney was exposed through a midline abdominal in.
cision and the renal pedicle was carefully dissected free of
the surrounding adipose tissue. The lower pole, upper pole,
and posterior surface of the kidney were infarcted by ligat￾ing the secondary and tertiary branches of the renal artery
with 6-0 silk suture. 1 wk later the rats were again anesthe￾tized with ether and a right nephrectomy was performed.
Approximately 5-7 d later, the rats were prepared for study.
In 11 rats, the renal papilla was exposed and prepared for
micropuncture as previously described (22). In the remain￾ing 10 rats, a piece of polyethylene tubing (PE No. 50) was
placed in the bladder and standard clearance studies were
performed. 25 rats underwent sham operation - 14 d before
study, the time between renal infarction and study in the
group with the RK. In 10 of the sham-operated animals, only
clearance studies were performed; in the remaining 15, the
left kidney was prepared for papillary micropuncture (22).
In all rats, food but not water was withheld for '-12 h before
study.
On the day of micropuncture the rats were anesthetized
with Inactin (Promonta, Hamburg, West Germany). Im￾mediately after the abdomen was opened but before the
kidney was prepared for study, all rats were given an inulin
prime in 1 ml of 0.9% NaCl. This was followed by an infusion
of normal saline containing inulin in sufficient amounts to
maintain the plasma concentration >50 mg/dl. The infusion
rate was calculated at 35 ul/min per 100 g body wt. This
rate of fluid replacement resulted in a stable hematocrit. The
mean value was 42.2±3.3% in the control and 39.6±0.6% in
the remnant group at the beginning of the study, and
41.4±0.8 and 39.9±0.6%, respectively, at the end of the ex￾periment. These values were slightly lower (P < 0.01) than
those obtained before the institution of fluid replacement
(44.9±0.8% in controls and 41.3±0.6% in the RK group). In
all studies an equilibration period of 45-60 min was allowed.
Collection from the papillary structures was instituted 20-
30 min following removal of the ureteral pelvis. In each
group, two to five loops were identified visually and timed
tubule fluid samples were collected. Immediately after the
collection of each timed sample a microquinhydrone pipet
was introduced into the tubule site of the previous puncture.

In most cases, fluid spontaneously entered the pipet and
when a sufficient amount was collected to cover the end of
the electrode, the pipet was removed and the tip immedi￾ately sealed with egg albumin. In all cases the sample size
was <10 nl, as judged visually. Samples were then obtained
from CD at sites as close to the base of the papilla (CDprox)
as possible and from points along the same CD near the tip
(CD,i,). The distance between the two collecting duct sites
was estimated with an eyepiece micrometer. In almost all
cases, fluid samples were obtained from at least two different
CD. In situ pH was then determined at the sites of previous
collection using double-barreled pipettes consisting of a glass
membrane pH microelectrode and a reference electrode.
Either before or after collections from papillary structures
were obtained, the cortical surface was illuminated with a
fiberoptics light guide attached to a quartz rod. The end
accessible portion of proximal and distal tubules was iden￾tified by a small amount of 5% lissamine green (0.02-0.05
ml) injected intravenously. After the dye disappeared from
the surface of the kidney timed tubule fluid collections were
obtained, in situ pH measurements were made, and fluid
was collected into a microquinhydrone electrode.
The methods for the measurements of volume and the
tubule fluid concentration of sodium, potassium, osmolality,
and inulin are reported elsewhere (22). The concentration
of ammonium and titratable acid in the tubule fluid sample
was determined with a microtitrating apparatus that has
been described in prior studies (18, 19, 23). The bicarbonate
concentration of tubule fluid was calculated from in vitro
pH measurements determined with the microquinhydrone
electrodes and a modification of the Henderson-Hasselbalch
equation (19). The precision and accuracy of these methods
have been detailed in previous studies (18, 19). The double￾barreled pH microelectrodes for both titration of tubule fluid
samples and in situ pH measurements were constructed with
pH-sensitive glass as described by Pucacco and Carter (24).
The pH-sensitive side of the microelectrode was filled with
1 mM magnesium acetate saturated with silver chloride. The
reference side contained a solution of 2.5 M KCI and 0.5 M
KNO3. The potential difference between the two sides of the
microelectrode was sensed by an electrometer (model 602C,
Keithley Instruments, Cleveland, OH) to which they were
connected by silver chloride wires. In all cases the reported
values were obtained after the measurement had remained
stable for 45-60 s. These electrodes were checked with buff￾ers of known pH before and after in situ pH measurements
had been made. The slope of the pH electrodes used in the
study averaged 58.1±0.07 mV/pH unit.
Blood samples and blood pressure measurements were
obtained at hourly intervals or immediately after the col￾lection of tubule fluid. Body temperature was determined
with a rectal thermometer and maintained at 36°-38°C. In
sham-operated rats, one or two timed collections of urine
were made in preweighed test tubes and the volume was
determined gravimetrically. The methods for determination
of inulin, sodium, potassium, osmolality, blood urea nitrogen
(BUN) in plasma and urine have been described previously
(22). Arterial pH and Pco2 was measured hourly with a blood
gas microsystem (BMS-3, Radiometer America, Inc.,
Westlake OH). Urine and plasma ammonium concentration
was determined with an ion specific electrode and a flow
through cell (Orion Research, Inc., Cambridge, MA) as pre￾viously described (18).
Tubule fluid-to-plasma inulin ratios (TF/P,1) permitted
the calculation of fractional fluid reabsorption before the site
of micropuncture. Single nephron glomerular filtration rate
(SNGFR) and fractional delivery of fluid (FD), and ions to
the site of micropuncture were determined using standard
formulas.
At proximal sites, renal tubule secretion of ammonium
(TNH+) was calculated according to the following formula:
TNH+ = (TFNH+Vtf) - (FLNH+), where TFNH+Vff is the absolute
delivery of NH+ to each site of micropuncture and FLNH+ is
the single nephron filtered load of this cation (SNGFR
X PNH+). Entry of ammonium between the end of the proxi￾mal and distal tubule [(TNH+)DI9W was calculated as the differ￾ence in the ammonium delivered to these sites: (TNH+)DUaI
= (TFNH+Vtf)DitaI - (TFNH+Vtf)proxim.I. Mean values for absolute
delivery of ammonium delivered to the end of the proximal
and distal tubule for each rat were used in these latter cal￾culations.
The net acid content of tubule fluid samples was calculated
as follows: TFNA = (TFTA) + (TFNH - (TFHCo-), where TF
is the tubule fluid concentration of net acid (NA), titratable
acid (TA), ammonium (NH+), and bicarbonate HCO ). The
bicarbonate content of CD fluid was not determined. Be￾cause of the relatively low pH it seemed justified to assume
that TF,,(-O did not contribute significantly to the overall
measurements. Thus, TFNA = TFTA + TFNH4. The rate of
hydrogen secretion before the site of micropuncture was
assumed to be TFII+Vtf = TFTAVtf + TFNH4VIf + THCOS, where
TFXVtf is the absolute delivery of TA and NH+ to the site of
micropuncture and THCOS is the absolute rate of bicarbonate
reabsorption before this site. The index for titratable acid,
ammonium, and net acid was calculated according to the
following formula: TFX/(TF/PIn), where x is the TA, NH+,
and NA content of the sample.
The mean values for individual micropuncture samples
obtained at similar anatomical sites for each rat were used
for statistical analysis. Mean differences in whole kidney and
superficial nephron function were examined by the Student's
t test for unpaired data when comparing the two groups of
animals studied and for paired data when comparing su￾perficial and deep nephron functions in the same animal or
when comparing proximal and tip measurements along the
same CD. When indicated, samples were compared statis￾tically after logarithmic transformation (25).
RESULTS
Table I summarizes the base-line information obtained
in the two groups of rats. Micropuncture and clearance
studies were performed 11.4±2.8 d (SD) after sham
operation and 12.9±1.9 d after left renal infarction.
There was no statistical difference in the body weights
of the two groups of animals at the time of the study.
The mean weight of the RK was slightly more than
a third of the values obtained for the total renal mass
of the sham-operated group. This reduction in renal
mass was reflected in a significant rise in BUN (from
20.7±0.9 to 59.4±6.1 mg/dl [SE], P < 0.001). At the
time of study, rats with an RK exhibited a mild met￾abolic acidosis; both the arterial pH and bicarbonate
concentration were significantly lower in this group
than in the sham-operated group. Plasma ammonium
concentrations were not different in the two groups
of animals.

of animals was the same. In the remnant group, the
area of functioning renal tissue formed a central band
with scar tissue present on the posterior surface and
both superior and inferior poles. Microscopically, renal
tubules on the surface of the RK appeared larger and
more dilated than those of the CK. The appearance
of the papilla available for study was not different in
the two groups of rats. The mean length averaged
1.1±0.1 mm for the RK compared with 1.2±0.1 mm
for the CK.
Clearance studies
The mean values for whole kidney function obtained
in 10 sham-operated rats and in 10 rats with an RK
are presented in Table I1. The GFR of the RK averaged
523±62 ,ul/min, a third of the mean obtained in the
control group, 1,366+114 .d/min. However, because
of the threefold increase in fractional fluid excretion
by the RK (from 0.365±0.043 to 1.05±0.48%, P
< 0.01), urine flow (V) did not differ statistically in
the two groups. Mean values for urine pH obtained
in the control and remnant group were virtually the
same. However, the total buffered acid excreted, that
is, net acid excretion, was reduced in the group with
the RK (794±81 vs. 1,220±105 neq/min in controls,
P < 0.001). This decrease was primarily due to a re￾duction in the excretion of ammonium, which aver￾aged 494±54 nmol/min, in contrast to 871±79 nmol/
min for the control group (P < 0.001). Neverthe￾less, ammonium excretion by the RK rose relative to
the filtered load. Fractional excretion averaged
1,154±142% in contrast to 803±107% for controls (P
< 0.05) indicating that adaptation in ammonium pro￾duction by the remaining nephrons occurred in this
setting.
Nephron function
Surface nephrons. SNGFR measurements obtained
near the end of the proximal tubule of the RK averaged
27.8±2.6 nl/min, which was not different from the
mean obtained at end distal sites (Table III). However,
both values were significantly greater than measure￾ments obtained in the sham-operated group, which
averaged 14.7±0.9 and 13.3±1.6 nl/min, respectively
(P < 0.005). As in previous studies (22), delivery of
fluid to the end of the proximal and distal tubule of
the RK was significantly greater than delivery to these
sites in the CK. In absolute terms, fluid delivery to the
end of the proximal tubule averaged 17.3±1.9 nl/min
in the remnant group in contrast to only 7.5±0.5 nl/

min in the sham-operated group. There was a similar
increase in fractional fluid delivery to this site (from
51.6±2.4 to 61.2±2.4%, P < 0.01). Fluid delivery to
end distal sites averaged 7.03±1.02 nl/min after renal
mass was reduced, threefold greater than the mean of
controls (2.11±0.34 nl/min, P < 0.001). Fractional de￾livery of fluid to the end of the distal tubule of the RK
increased similarly from 16.1±1.8 to 27.0±4.0% (P
< 0.025).
Acid measurements were made at 26 end proximal
and 18 end distal micropuncture sites in the group
with the RK. Similar measurements were made near
the end of 33 proximal and 16 distal tubules of surface
nephrons in the sham-operated group. Data obtained
for both groups of animals are summarized in Table
III. In situ pH measurements made near the end of
the proximal tubule averaged 6.75±0.09 in the group
with the RK. This value was slightly lower than the
mean obtained at this site in the control group
(6.92±0.05). This small increase in the free acid con￾centration was associated with a marked increase in
the total buffered acid content of fluid delivered to
this site. Tubule fluid titratable acid concentration was
almost twofold greater in the RK group, averaging
1.89±0.25 meq/liter compared with 1.01±0.11 meq/
liter for controls (P < 0.005). Absolute delivery of ti￾tratable acid to this site was nearly fivefold greater,

rising from 7.09±1.20 in controls to 31.1±5.0 peq/min
in the RK group. The ammonium concentration in
fluid obtained near the end of the proximal tubule of
the RK averaged 4.17±0.38 mM, nearly twice the
mean obtained in the CK. Absolute delivery of am￾monium rose from 18.4±1.9 to 66.2±5.6 peq/min after
renal mass was reduced by two-thirds, (P < 0.001).
The increase was primarily a consequence of entry of
ammonium between the glomerulus and the site of
collection. This is evidenced by the proportional in￾crease in TNH4 and the twofold rise in the fractional
delivery of ammonium to the end of the proximal tu￾bule. Further, this increased delivery was more than
could be accounted for by the differences in tubule
flow rate (Fig. 1). Despite the marked increase in de￾livery of buffered acid to the end of the proximal tu￾bule of the RK, fractional bicarbonate reabsorption
before this micropuncture site was reduced and ab￾solute delivery of bicarbonate increased from 54.4±6.9
to 134±20 pmol/min. In fractional terms, delivery rose
from 19.3±2.2 to 29.4±3.7% (P < 0.005). Despite the
marked increase in buffered acid delivery to the end
of the proximal tubule of the RK, total hydrogen se￾cretion before this site did not increase in proportion

to the reduction in renal mass. The increase was less
than twofold and averaged 433±54 peq/min in con￾trast to 238±16 peq/min for the CK (Fig. 2).
The in situ pH determined at end distal micro￾puncture sites was not significantly different in the two
groups of animals. However, titratable acid concen￾tration and delivery were strikingly greater in the RK
group. Tubule fluid titratable acid concentration av￾eraged 4.84±0.78 in contrast to 2.22±0.39 meq/liter
in the control group. Titratable acid delivery was in￾creased nearly sixfold, averaging 31.8±7.6 vs. 5.42±1.25
peq/min in sham-operated rats. Ammonium delivery
to this site was also greater after renal mass was re￾duced, averaging 29.3±5.5 pmol/min in contrast to
10.7± 1.9 pmol/min in the control group. However, as
we have reported previously, in normal and acidotic
rats (18, 19) delivery of ammonium to this site was
significantly less than to the end of the proximal tubule.
This is depicted graphically in Fig. 3. The net loss of
ammonium between the end of the proximal and distal
tubule averaged 38.2±5.0 pmol/min, fourfold greater
than that of the sham-operated group, which was
9.1±2.3 pmol/min. As a consequence, fractional de￾livery of ammonium to the end distal site was less than
to end proximal micropuncture sites in both groups of
animals.
Bicarbonate delivery to the end of the distal tubule
of the RK was markedly greater than to this site in
shams. In absolute terms the mean value for the RK
group was 58.8±12.5 pmol/min in contrast to 8.76±2.33
pmol/min in controls. Fractional delivery of bicar￾bonate rose from 4.16±1.29% in controls to 13.7±3.3%
after renal mass was reduced. Hydrogen secretion
prior to this site averaged 465±71 peq/min and did
not differ significantly from the mean value obtained
near the end of the proximal tubule (Fig. 2).
Deep nephrons. In the remnant kidney SNGFR
measurements made near the bend of Henle's loop
(BHL) of deep nephrons averaged 35.9±3.2 nl/min.
This value is similar to what has been previously re￾ported (22, 26) and was significantly greater than the
mean obtained for the CK (Table IV). There was the
expected increase in absolute and fractional delivery of fluid to the BHL after renal mass was reduced (21,
26). The tubule flow rate was greater for the RK and
averaged 7.20±0.76, in contrast to 3.38±0.33 nl/min
after sham operation (P < 0.001). Fractional fluid de￾livery increased from 14.5±0.9 in controls to 20.6±1.3%
in this setting (P < 0.001).
Acid measurements were made in fluid obtained
near the BHL of 35 deep nephrons in the sham-op￾erated group and from 27 nephrons in the RK group.
Mean values for these data are presented in Table IV
and are contrasted with measurements obtained near
the end of the proximal tubule of surface nephrons in
Fig. 4. Mean tubule fluid pH measured near the BHL
in the remnant group averaged 7.14±0.08. This value
was significantly less than the mean for the controls

(7.34±0.05, P < 0.05). In both groups in situ pH mea￾surements made at this site were consistently and sig￾nificantly greater than the values obtained near the
end of the proximal tubule of surface nephrons. The
concentration of titratable acid measured near the
BHL was considerably lower than values obtained at
end proximal sites of surface nephrons, but was not
different in the two groups of animals. Because of the
difference in the rate of tubule flow, delivery of ti￾tratable acid was fourfold greater after renal mass was
reduced than after sham operation (6.87±2.55 peq/
min vs. 1.63±0.53 peq/min in the control group). In
both groups titratable acid delivery was considerably
greater to end proximal micropuncture sites of surface
nephrons (Fig. 4).
As expected, the filtered load of ammonium in deep
nephrons was significantly greater in the remnant
group than in shams. The tubule fluid concentration
of ammonium measured near the BHL was actually
lower in the remnant group, averaging 9.52±1.08 mM
compared with 14.5±1.7 mM after sham operation.
Despite this, delivery of ammonium to the bend in￾creased significantly, from 45.6±7.0 to 70.2±13.3
pmol/min. This increase was primarily due to the dif￾ferences in nephron size resulting from hypertrophy
of the RK. Thus, TNHJ was greater to this site in the
RK but fractional delivery of ammonium to this site
was unchanged.
Absolute bicarbonate delivery to the BHL was sig￾nificantly greater after remnant formation, averaging
113±11 pmol/min in contrast to 79.5±9.7 pmol/min
in the control group (P < 0.05). This occurred despite
the fact that tubule fluid bicarbonate concentration
was actually lower after renal mass was reduced,
(16.6±1.6 vs. 24.6±1.8 mM in controls, P < 0.005). On

the BHL of deep nephrons did not differ significantly
in the two groups of rats. Although total hydrogen
secreted proximal to this site of collection was signif￾icantly greater in the RK group, averaging 624±70
peq/min vs. 432±42 peq/min (Fig. 2), the increase
was not in proportion to the reduction in renal mass.
Papillary CD function
Mean measurements obtained near the base and tip
of the CD of control and RK are presented in Table
V. The distance between proximal and tip CD sites
averaged 0.81±0.05 mm in the control group. This
value was not statistically different from that of RK
(0.79±0.03 mm). In both groups fractional delivery of
fluid fell between the base and tip of the CD and was
accompanied by a significant increase in the osmolality
of fluid between these two sites. However, the fraction
of the filtered load of fluid remaining at proximal and
tip CD sites was greater for the RK than the CK. Sim￾ilarly the osmolality of fluid obtained at the base of
the CD was significantly less after renal infarction than
after sham operation (903±39 vs. 1,193±62 mosmol/
kg water in controls, P < 0.001). These results are
similar to what we have previously reported after rem￾nant formation and in hydropenia (22).
In situ pH measurements at proximal and tip CD
sites were not statistically different in the two groups
of animals. In both groups the pH measured at prox￾imnal sites was greater than the mean obtained at tip
CD sites. The concentration of titratable acid at both
sites was similar in the two groups of animals. The TA
index averaged 0.57±0.11 at the proximal and
0.43±0.03 at tip CD sites after sham operation, which
are similar to values that we have previously reported
(19). The TA index measured at these two CD sites
was threefold greater in the RK group. However, as
in the control group there was no statistical difference
in measurements made at these two sites of collection.
The ammonium concentration measured near the
base of the CD was significantly less in the RK, av￾eraging 60.1±6.8 mM in contrast to 105±11 mM after
sham operation. In both groups, the concentration rose
between the base and the tip of the CD. Fractional
delivery of this buffer to the base of the CD was
902±96% after sham operation and did not change by
tip CD sites. In the remnant group delivery was
greater, averaging 1,323±133%, but as with shams, was
not different from the average obtained near the tip
of the CD. The relationship between fractional deliv￾ery of ammonium to the end of the proximal tubule
and the base of the CD is depicted in Fig. 5 for both
groups of animals. In controls, delivery to these sites
did not differ statistically. However, FDNH4 to CDprox
in the RK group was significantly less than the mean
measured near the end of the proximal tubule. The

measured near the base of the CD was not different

the RK group, the NH' index did not change statis￾tically between base and tip CD sites. However, the
values were significantly greater at both CD sites in

DISCUSSION
In this study a two-thirds reduction in renal mass af￾fected the capacity of the residual functioning neph￾rons to excrete acid in ways similar to those described
by other investigators in humans (4, 10-13) and in
experimental animals (14-17). That is, the capacity of
the RK to excrete acid was significantly impaired and
a metabolic acidosis ensued. In this setting titratable
acid excretion and urine pH measurements were sta￾tistically the same for the sham-operated group and
the group with the RK. In contrast, ammonium ex￾cretion was reduced by nearly 50% after RK formation.
However, as in previous studies (1-4, 10-17), there
was clear evidence of enhanced ammonium produc￾tion by the RK. That is, when factored by filtered load
the excretion of ammonium from the RK was greater
than from the CK (Table II). Therefore, it seems rea￾sonable to assume that a partial infarction of the left
kidney followed by right nephrectomy provides a valid
model for the segmental analysis of the adaptive
changes in acid excretion by superficial nephrons, deep
nephrons, and the terminal segment of CD when renal
mass is reduced.
After renal mass is reduced, ammonium delivery to
the end of the superficial proximal tubule in the RK
group rose more than threefold, averaging 66 pmol/
min. Although this increase appeared to be propor￾tional to the decrease in renal mass, it is difficult to
assess the absolute contribution to ammonium excre￾tion by superficial nephrons because the number re￾maining in the RK is uncertain. However, if one as￾sumes that (a) nephron hypertrophy results in a 29%
increase in the weight of the RK (27), (b) 72% of the
nephrons remaining are superficial (28), and (c) the
kidney of a rat contains 30,000 nephrons (29), then
one can estimate the total number of surface nephrons
contained in the remnant kidney from the following
formula: 0.71(RK/CK) X 21,600, where RK is the
mean weight of RK (268 mg) and CK is the mean
weight of the left kidney (426 mg) of the control group
of those rats that underwent micropuncture study.

Thus, -9,700 surface nephrons are contained in the
RK of the animals that underwent micropuncture
study. If these estimates are correct, then 676±44
nmol/min are delivered out of the superficial proximal
tubules of the RK. This value was not significantly
different from that calculated for both kidneys of the
sham-operated group (747±73 nmol/min). Although
there was an increase in the filtered load of ammonium
and in nephron size after RK formation, the major
reason for the increased delivery was that entry of
ammonia along the proximal tubule was markedly en￾hanced (Table III). Several factors appear responsible
for this. First, the tubule fluid flow rate near the end
of the proximal tubule of the RK was more than twice
the control value (Table III). This increase would op￾timize the concentration gradient for the diffusion of
ammonia into this tubule segment and therefore in￾crease delivery of ammonium to the proximal micro￾puncture sites. Indeed, the flow dependence of am￾monia entry along the proximal tubule is readily ap￾parent in Fig. 1. Nevertheless, it does not seem likely
that this increase in flow rate is the entire explanation,
since the concentration of ammonium in fluid obtained
at this site was higher in the RK than in the control
group. Further, ammonia entry along the proximal
tubule was greater in the RK group at any level of
flow. A second factor is that luminal pH measured near
the end of proximal tubule of the RK was slightly lower
than that measured in controls. This increased pH gra￾dient would favor luminal entry and entrapment of
ammonia in the proximal tubule. A third factor that
could have contributed to an enhanced entry of am￾monia along the proximal tubule was the mild meta￾bolic acidosis exhibited by the RK group. The mean
arterial pH and plasma bicarbonate concentration
were significantly lower in this group than in the sham￾operated group. However, ammonium delivery out of
the proximal tubule of the RK was substantially greater
than that we have reported for rats chronically fed
ammonium chloride (18, 19). In those studies, we
found that ammonium delivery to the end of the prox￾imal tubule increased by only twofold in face of met￾abolic acidosis that was more profound than that seen
after RK formation. Indeed, the difference in delivery
to this site under the two experimental conditions is
more strikingly seen when ammonium delivery is fac￾tored by kidney weight. In this study, delivery to this
micropuncture site in the RK group averaged 259+27,
fivefold the value of 51.5±5.2 pmol/min per g kidney
wt we reported for the group made chronically aci￾dotic (19).2 Thus, the changes in ammonium delivery
seen after renal mass was reduced can be only partially

Tables II and IV of reference 19.
explained on the basis of changes in the acid-base status
of the rat. Nevertheless, it seems likely that an increase
in the cortical production of ammonia is a major factor
contributing to the increase in the end proximal de￾livery of ammonium. Although the rate of ammonium
production cannot be determined from the data pre￾sented in this work, an estimate of differences in the
production of ammonia by renal cortical tissue in the
two groups of animals can be obtained by calculating
the pNH3 of the cortex. If it is true that ammonia entry
into the tubule lumen is due to nonionic diffusion of
the free base NH3 where protonation and entrapment
occurs (30), and that NH3 is in equilibration through￾out all structures located in the cortex (31, 32), then
given the in situ pH and ammonium concentration of
fluid obtained near the end of the proximal tubule, the
pNH3 of the renal cortex can be calculated with the
following formula (33, 34):
PNH,3 =total NH4 x
22.09
10pK-pH + 1 a
Using a pK of 9.02 (35) and the solubility coefficient
(a) of 0.626 (34), cortical pNH3 averaged 1,267±234
mmHg X 10-6 in the RK group, twofold the value in
the sham-operated group (658±70 mmHg X 10-6). If
intracellular pH fell during acidosis (36) and if am￾monia entry was due solely to diffusion and no increase
in synthesis occurred, then one would expect that the
cortical pNH3 of the RK group would be lower than
that of the sham-operated group. The results of the
present study are therefore most consistent with en￾hanced cortical production of ammonia by the RK, a
finding that is in agreement with previous studies of
this model of renal disease (17).
The rate of titratable acid excretion also increased
in proportion to the decrease in renal mass; this is com￾patible with previous studies in which titratable acid
excretion from the diseased kidney did not change (4,
11, 12). This increased excretion was associated with
a similar increase in proximal delivery of titratable
acid and was most likely a consequence of the different
filtered loads of phosphate in the two groups of animals
(4, 11, 12).
In the RK total hydrogen secretion before the end
of the proximal tubule increased by less than twofold
the value obtained in the sham-operated group. This
increase was in near proportion to the adaptive change
in SNGFR and was therefore not in proportion to the
threefold decrease in renal mass (Fig. 2). Thus, bicar￾bonate delivery to the end of the proximal tubu4le was
increased in both absolute and fractional terms. The
finding that bicarbonate reabsorption in the proximal
segments of surface nephrons is lower after renal mass
is reduced is compatible with previous studies in hu￾mans (4, 5) and in experimental animals (6-8). The
mechanism for this decreased reabsorption cannot be

determined from the present study, although part of
the explanation may relate to the decrease in fractional
sodium reabsorption that occurs in this segment of the
RK (1, 6, 22). As a result there was an increase in
bicarbonate delivery to the distal tubule where the
capacity to secrete hydrogen ion is more limited (37).
After renal mass was reduced delivery of ammo￾nium to the BHL of deep nephrons increased but not
to the same extent as ammonium delivery to the end
of the proximal tubule of surface nephrons (Fig. 4).
If the previously stated assumptions are correct, and
-3,770 deep nephrons are contained in the RK, then
total delivery of ammonium out of the proximal seg￾ments of this nephron population would be 264±50
nmol/min. This is less than half of the ammonium
delivered out of the superficial proximal tubules. In
the sham-operated group total ammonium delivery to
the BHL of deep nephrons and to the end of the prox￾imal tubules of surface nephrons did not differ statis￾tically (329±47 and 396±14 nmol/min, respectively).
Thus, while there was evidence of an increase in am￾monium production by the deep nephron proximal
segments of the RK, total ammonium delivery to the
BHL of all deep nephrons of this kidney did not ap￾proach the twofold increase needed for complete ad￾aptation. These results are in sharp contrast to those
observed in chronic metabolic acidosis (18, 19). In that
setting, the deep nephron population played an im￾portant role in the renal response to an acid load. The
ammonium concentration of loop fluid more than dou￾bled and delivery to the BHL increased significantly.
The mean ammonium delivery was 152±17 pmol/min
per g kidney wt, more than threefold that obtained
near the end of the proximal tubule of acidotic rats.3
The response of deep nephrons to an acid load was
therefore greater than that of surface nephrons (18,
19). In this study, when factored by kidney weight,
delivery of ammonium to the deep nephron BHL
of the RK was 260±38 pmol/mg per g kidney wt
(P < 0.025) and was not different from the mean ob￾tained near the end of the proximal tubule. This value
was less than twice that obtained in chronic acidosis,
whereas the delivery of ammonium to end proximal
micropuncture sites after RK formation were more
than five times that observed after the induction of a
chronic metabolic acidosis.
The failure in complete adaptation by deep neph￾rons after a reduction in renal mass does not appear
to be a consequence of altered proximal proton secre￾tion; in this study hydrogen ion secretion in this seg￾ment of deep and surface nephrons increased to a sim￾ilar extent (Fig. 2). Rather, it seems that the differences
3The mean value was derived from data presented in
Tables II and V of reference 19.
in delivery under the two experimental circumstances
are related to the reduction in the solute concentration
of the papillary interstitium. Several factors support
this hypothesis. First, the osmolality of loop fluid was
significantly less after RK formation than after sham
operation (Table IV) or after the induction of a chronic
metabolic acidosis (18). Second, the concentration gra￾dient for ammonium between the end of the proximal
tubule and the BHL (4.8 to 9.4 mM) was considerably
less in the RK than in the CK (2.5 vs. 14.8 mM near
the BHL). Indeed, the concentration of ammonium in
fluid obtained near the BHL was actually lower in the
RK group than in controls. Finally, estimates of the
pNH3 content of the papillary interstitium averaged
4,963±764 mmHg X 10-' in the RK group, a value
which was less than half the mean of 11,754±2,425
mmHg X 10-6 calculated for the control group. The
countercurrent multiplication of ammonia in the pap￾illary interstitium appears impaired when renal mass
is reduced. One factor responsible for this failure is
that the tubule flow rate measured near the BHL of
deep nephrons is increased. An increase in medullary
blood flow to the papilla would also serve to dissipate
the gradient, although to date there is no information
available to support this possibility. Such changes in
the dynamics of countercurrent multiplication might
enhance the upstream movement of ammonia out of
the renal tubule of deep nephrons and account for the
smaller increase in ammonium delivery to BHL than
to end proximal micropuncture sites.
In situ pH measurements made along the distal tu￾bule of the RK averaging 6.61, were not significantly
different from values measured at this site in sham￾operated rats, and the gradient for hydrogen secretion
in the distal tubule of the RK is the same as in controls.
Because of the difference in flow rate, however, free
hydrogen delivery to the end of the distal tubule of
the RK is actually greater. Nevertheless, these data
suggest that the segments between the end of the prox￾imal and distal tubule of surface nephrons are not
major sites of proton secretion under normal conditions
or after renal mass is reduced. That is, the rate of
hydrogen ion secretion that occurred between the end
of the proximal and distal tubule in both groups of
animals was not great enough to be detected with the
methods used in the present work (Fig. 2). Neverthe￾less, distal delivery of bicarbonate was less than to end
proximal micropuncture sites. It seems likely that part
of this decrease was due to bicarbonate buffering by
the hydrogen ion previously bound to the ammonia,
which was lost in the intervening segment, and to con￾tinued hydrogen secretion along the remaining prox￾imal segments of the nephron.
In this study there is evidence to suggest than when
renal mass is reduced ammonium entry along the med￾ullary and terminal segments of the CD is inappro￾Net Acid Formation and Ammonium Production by the Remnant Kidney 167t3

priately low. Although the index for net acid excretion
increased to a greater extent between the end of the
distal tubule and CDprox in the group with the RK, it
is apparent that the greater increase in this index was
not a reflection of differences in ammonium entry or
in the titration of phosphate along this segment (Fig.
7). Rather, the increase seems attributable to the ti￾tration of the bicarbonate delivered out of the distal
tubule. Thus, a reduction in renal mass does not result
in enhanced entrapment of ammonia along this seg￾ment. These data contrast sharply with those obtained
in rats made chronically acidotic (18, 19). In those
studies, the increase in the NH' index between the end
of the distal tubule and the base of the CD was twofold
greater after the chronic administration of ammonium
chloride. In fractional terms, >800% of the filtered
ammonium entered along this segment in contrast to
<300% in the control group. Further, fractional de￾livery of ammonium to the base of the CD was sig￾nificantly greater than to the end of the proximal tu￾bule in chronically acidotic rats (18), whereas in the
present study delivery of ammonium to the base of
CD was consistently lower in the group with the RK
(Figs. 5 and 6).
Although the entire explanation for this failure to
reentrap ammonia along the CD after RK formation
remains unclear, several factors are apparent. First,
as in controls, the terminal segment of the CD of the
RK secretes hydrogen ion. Tubule fluid pH measured
at the base of the papilla was significantly greater than
that measured near the tip. The decline in luminal pH
between the end of the distal tubule and the base of
the CD was also similar in the two groups of animals,
which suggests that the gradient for hydrogen ion se￾cretion along the entire CD is the same in both groups
of animals. Therefore, an alteration in the hydrogen
ion gradient between the lumen and cell of the CD
cannot be an explanation for the loss of ammonium
produced in the proximal tubule. Second, as in acidosis
(18, 19), the loss of ammonia between proximal and
distal micropuncture sites is enhanced after renal mass
is reduced (Fig. 3 and Table III). Thus, delivery of
ammonia to the medullary interstitium appears ap￾propriate after a reduction in renal mass. On the other
hand, it seems likely that a significant portion of the
ammonia produced in the proximal segments of sur￾face nephrons is lost to the circulation. The concen￾tration of ammonium in the tul)ule fluid obtained near
the BHL was lower after RK formation than after sham
operation, and delivery of ammonium to this site did
not increase appropriately. Furthermore, Maclean and
Hayslett (17), comparing control and RK groups found
that there was a significantly greater percentage of the
ammonium produced by the RK in the venous effluent
than in the final urine. Thus, it seems likely that the
altered dynamics of solute concentration in the pap￾illary interstitium after renal mass is reduced may af￾fect the capacity of the RK to establish high concen￾trations of ammonia in the papilla. This would de￾crease the gradient favoring the movement of ammonia
into CD fluid.
In conclusion, the present study suggests that two
mechanisms underly the incapacity of the RK to se￾crete a hydrogen load. First, hydrogen secretion in the
proximal segment of deep and surface nephrons does
not increase in proportion to the decrease in renal
mass. As a consequence, more bicarbonate is delivered
out of these segments. This obligates the distal nephron
segment to reclaim bicarbonate rather than to titrate
nonabsorbable buffers. Second, the decrease in am￾monium excretion after renal mass is reduced is due
to a failure to reentrap ammonia along the distal neph￾ron rather than to a reduction in the capacity of the
cortical segments of the nephron to produce ammonia.
