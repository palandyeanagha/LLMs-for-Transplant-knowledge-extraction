ABSTRACT
Ischemic hepatitis is an important, yet underdiagnosed pathological condition seen in either cardiology or 
hepatology clinics or intensive care units. The main causes are severe heart failure, circulatory and septic 
shock. Close monitoring of biological tests (AST, ALT, LDH) together with hemodynamic parameters (blood 
pressure, cardiac output and central venous pressure) allow for rapid and accurate diagnosis. Correction of 
hemodynamic parameters, hypoxemia, hepatic and/or renal dysfunction leads to a more favorable outcome 
of these patients. 
Keywords: ischemic hepatitis, severe heart failure, shock, biological tests, hemodynamic 
parameters.
INTRODUCTION
I
schemic hepatitis (IH) is a clinical, biological 
and histological syndrome characterized by 
a rapid, significant and transient rise in the 
plasma aminotransferase level (AST, aspar￾tate aminotransferase and ALT, alanine ami￾notransferase) in various pathological conditions, 
such as heart failure (HF), circulatory or septic 
shock, respiratory failure. The pathologic hall￾mark of IH is hepatocellular necrosis in the cen￾trilobular zone, known as hepatic centrilobular 
necrosis(1). Ischemic hepatitis has also been re￾ferred to in the literature as “hypoxic hepatitis” 
(HH) or “shock liver”. The term “hypoxic hepati￾tis” emphasizes multifactorial pathophysiologic 
factors resulting in hypoxia and subsequent bio￾logical and histological changes. The term 
“shock” might not be very accurate, as centri￾lobular ischemia and necrosis are not always as￾sociated with shock. 
Congestive hepatopathy describes a spectrum 
of clinical and biological manifestations (e.g., mild 
increase in plasma aminotransferase level) due to 
passive and often prolonged hepatic congestion 
occurring in the setting of right-sided heart failure 
(e.g., dilated cardiomyopathy, mitral stenosis, 
constrictive pericarditis). The morphological 
pattern is centrilobular congestion (1, 2). Conges­

tive hepatopathy may precede the onset of is￾chemic hepatitis. However, there is a significant 
overlap between these two conditions. In fact, 
both ischemic and congestive hepatitis are the 
result of constant interaction and relation 
between cardiac and liver disease, related to 
specific pathophysiologic setting and different 
stages of heart failure. 
Ischemic hepatitis is a pathological condition 
which is managed nowadays by at least three 
types of medical specialties: cardiology, hepa￾tology and intensive care. There are still unmet 
needs concerning a relatively high incidence, 
underdiagnosis and poor prognosis of IH/HH, 
which require a more rigorous and extensive 
research in this field. 
Three criteria are currently accepted for the 
diagnosis of IH/HH (3, 4):
- clinical setting, such as heart failure, 
circulatory or respiratory failure;
- sudden, significant, but transient raise in 
plasma aminotransferase level;
- exclusion of other causes of hepatic cellular 
necrosis, especially viral hepatitis or 
drug-induced hepatopathy. 
Epidemiology and etiology
The concept of IH/HH has been initially 
described in the setting of HF, following the 
morphological changes induced by the passive 
liver congestion. Later, IH/HH would become 
increasingly recognized in critically ill patients 
admitted in intensive care units (ICU). A minimum 
10 times sudden increase in plasma aminotrans￾ferase levels is the “cut-off” point for IH/HH 
diagnosis (5).
Incidence of IH has been previously reported 
between 0.6-1.5% amongst medical ICU patients 
(6). A more recent meta-analysis of 1782 patients 
concluded that IH/HH was diagnosed in 2.5% of 
subjects (7). The occurrence of IH was even 
higher (11%) in a multicentric study that enrolled 
1066 patients during their ICU admission period 
(8). Moreover, 18% of patients with cardiogenic 
shock following an acute myocardial infarction 
had an aminotransferase level >20 times the 
upper limit of normal, as reported in a recent 
study (9).
There is a wide variation in IH/HH incidence, 
especially in critically ill patients, related to the 
underlying pathological condition of each patient 
and also to different cut-off values for the plasma 
aminotransferase level. For example, IH/HH was 
diagnosed in 1.46% cases amongst 33654 pa￾tients admitted to ICU, when IH/HH was defined 
as a rapid increase of AST/ALT ≥ 800 UI/l, exclu￾ding other causes (10). 
The etiology of IH/HH is often multifactorial, 
with more than one risk factor identified as 
important triggers (Figure 1). Heart failure is the 
main etiopathogenic condition for IH/HH. In the 
previous meta-analysis (7), acute HF was present 
in 78% of patients with IH/HH. The risk of IH/HH 
was particularly high in the group of patients with 
right-sided HF and liver congestion, as a precon￾dition for IH/HH (6).
Other risk factors for IH/HH, besides HF, are 
septic shock (aproximately 23%), respiratory fail￾ure (approximately 15%), major cardiovascular 
surgery, anemia, hypovolemic shock, extensive 
burns, prolonged hypotension (4). 
Preexistent hepatic injuries that may favor 
IH/HH occurrence has to be considered in some 
patients: chronic viral hepatitis, non-alcoholic 
hepatitis, hepatic disease with portal hyperten￾sion or toxic hepatitis (drug-induced). These con￾ditions may raise important and difficult IH/HH 
diagnosis concerns. 
Pathophysiology
The pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in 
hepatocyte necrosis in the setting of ischemic 
hepatitis are directly related to hepatic blood 
flow characteristics. Hepatic blood flow accounts 
for about 25% of the cardiac output, delivered to 
the liver via two vascular systems: the portal vein

system (approximately two thirds of the blood 
flow) and the arterial hepatic system (approxi￾mately one third). The portal blood is rich in nu￾tritive elements but low in oxygen, whereas the 
arterial blood is rich in oxygen and accounts for 
more than 50% of the oxygen delivered in the 
liver. Thus, the liver is well protected against isch￾emia, primarily due to this dual system. Zones 1 
and 2 (central zones) belonging to the liver acinar 
structure receive the highest amount of oxygen, 
while lower oxygen concentration blood is deliv￾ered to zone 3 (perivascular zone), which be￾comes the most vulnerable area when exposed to 
changes in the hepatic blood flow. Maximum 
oxygen extraction occurs in the liver (approxi￾mately 90%) (4).
Hepatic arterial blood flow and portal blood 
flow are interdependent. Reduced venous portal 
flow (e.g., in heart failure) leads to hepatic arterial 
vasodilation and increased flow, and vice versa, 
increased venous portal flow leads to reduced ar￾terial blood flow. This autoregulation mechanism 
is adenosine mediated and is also known as “he￾patic arterial buffer response” (11). Adenosine, 
which is synthesized by liver cells and Kuppfer 
cells, is found around terminal hepatic arteries 
and is washed by the portal blood. A decrease in 
the portal blood flow leads to a rise in adenosine 
level and hepatic arteriolar dilation (11), whereas 
an increase in the portal blood flow leads to a 
decrease in the adenosine level in the space of 
Mall, followed by arteriolar vasoconstriction and 
lower hepatic arterial flow. 
Despite this autoregulation mechanism, most 
of the hepatic circulation via the portal vein 
system is not autoregulated, but depends on the 
mesenteric circulation and gradient between 
portal and hepatic veins pressure. A decrease in 
this gradient increases the ischemic risk of the 
liver (4). 
Cellular hypoxia plays a central role in the 
pathophysiology of hepatic centrilobular necrosis 
typical for ischemic hepatitis (Figure 2). Three 
main pathological conditions are defined: 
1) reduced hepatic flow and consecutive ische￾mia; 2) passive liver congestion; and 3) severe sys￾temic hypoxia. These conditions are seen in heart 
failure (chronic, acute), shock and severe respira￾tory failure. In critically ill patients, all the above 
situations may be present in different combina￾tions.
Heart failure is the major pathological 
condition that leads to IH/HH in approximately 
two thirds of cases. Heart failure with passive 
liver congestion is associated with an increased 
risk of IH/HH development. Passive hepatic 
congestion, usually chronic, is a major factor 
linked with IH/HH and probably a mandatory 
condition (5). 
In congestive hepatopathy, structural changes 
developed over time (sinusoidal centrilobular 
dilation, hepatocyte atrophy, perisinusoidal￾perivenular fibrosis) reduce oxygen diffusion and 
generate hypoxia, particularly in zone 3 (7). In 
heart failure patients, a supplementary decrease, 
even transient (minimum 20 minutes), in cardiac 
output and hepatic blood flow, often clinically 
undiagnosed, leads to hepatic necrosis, consi￾dering the liver has already been exposed to 
hypoxia due to passive hepatic congestion (6, 12). 
IH/HH may also develop in the setting of 
acute heart failure, as it is the case in acute 
myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, 
cardiac tamponade. In these cases, liver ischemia 
is the main mechanism of cellular hypoxia and 
necrosis, following severe decrease in cardiac 
output, arterial hypotension and reduced hepatic 
blood flow. 
Passive hepatic congestion and reduced 
arterial liver blood flow and “ischemia” lead to 
cellular hypoxia as final condition, in the setting 
of both chronic and acute heart failure.

Severe systemic hypoxia induced by 
respiratory failure (e.g., acute episodes of COPD, 
interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, etc) is the main 
cause of IH/HH in approximately 15% of cases. 
Severe arterial hypoxia (O2
 arterial 
pressure < 40 mmHg) significantly reduces 
oxygen delivery to hepatocytes and leads to 
cellular hypoxia. Systemic oxygen delivery falls 
below the critical level of 330 ml O2
/min/m2
(normal level 720 ml O2
/min/m2
) (14). Cardiac 
output and hepatic blood flow are normal or 
even higher than normal, as opposed to chronic 
heart failure. Thus, there is no actual liver 
ischemia. In patients with chronic decompensated 
cor pulmonale, passive hepatic congestion may 
also play an additional role. 
Shock, and especially septic shock, frequently 
seen in intensive care units, may lead to IH/HH. 
Septic shock prevalence varies from 11% to 16% 
and 23% (12, 13). The pathophysiologic 
mechanisms of IH/HH in patients with septic 
shock are different from cardiogenic shock. 
Cardiac output and hepatic blood flow are 
elevated, at least during the initial phase of septic 
shock. Hepatic hypoxia in septic shock is a result 
of hepatocytes increased metabolic needs, 
together with decreased O2
 extraction capacity, 
despite preserved O2
 saturation. Moreover, 
circulating endotoxins and inflammatory 
cytokines decrease the ability of hepatocytes to 
use oxygen and affect the microcirculation (15). 
Severe reduction in the cardiac output during 
shock may increase hepatic hypoxia. 
Recently, the role of ischemia/reperfusion 
process in IH/HH injury is being discussed. 
Hepatocyte necrosis is present not only during 
ischemia but also during reperfusion (16). 
Oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) may lead to injury either directly, by 
oxidation of proteins, lipids or DNA, or indirectly, 
by inflammatory cascade initiation and 
hepatocytes changes (17).
Hepatic cellular hypoxia is the final 
pathophysiological process, as a result of ischemia 
(flow reduction), passive hepatic congestion, 
systemic hypoxia or other previously mentioned 
conditions. At the cellular level, decreased 
oxygen intake is followed by adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP) depletion and failure of 
energy dependent metabolic pathways and 
transport systems. Approximately two hours from 
the onset of ischemia, first hypoxic lesions appear 
in the centrilobular region, but it takes three 
hours for the cellular injury to become irreversible 
(18). The cellular influx of Ca2+ signals 
non-reversible hepatocyte injury. Moreover, 
oxygen deprivation increases anaerobic glycolysis, 
lactate accumulation and decreased intracellular 
pH. Membrane transport is also affected, and 
potassium efflux in the extracellular space 
increases calcium storage in the cells. Cytosolic 
calcium activates proteases and phospholipases, 
which leads to a perpetual cellular membrane 
and cytoskeleton injury. Ischemia and probably 
apoptosis result in cellular death (12). 
Elevated blood enzymes represent a marker 
of cellular death and IH/HH, and are a result of 
hypoxic injury of hepatocyte mitochondria and 
endoplasmic reticulum, especially in the 
centrilobular region. Cellular membrane changes 
allow for their systemic discharge. Similar 
enzymatic changes have been experimentally 
described through arterial hypoxia, hypoperfusion 
or endotoxins injury (13).
Clinical manifestations
Clinical manifestations in IH/HH have little 
specificity and are largely related to the underlying 
pathological condition (HF, respiratory failure, 
septic shock, postoperative status).
Typically, IH/HH develops in patients with 
congestive HF and congestive hepatopathy, with 
or without systemic congestion. Usually, the 
patient is admitted in the intensive cardiac care 
unit and has severe HF, with a recent/acute 
decompensation episode, after a prior HF 
standard treatment with diuretics, beta-blockers, 
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors. 
On admission, the patient may have a moderate￾severe ill status with dyspnea, lethargy and 
drowsiness. 
The response to maximal in-hospital medical 
therapy is poorer in these patients, with persistent 
congestion signs and/or low cardiac output and 
incomplete response to diuretics (diuretic-resis￾tance).
The diagnosis of IH/HH, in the setting of 
congestive HF and systemic hypoperfusion, 
requires biological assessment and daily moni￾toring of several parameters. 
The typical diagnostic pattern is based on 
sudden elevation in plasma aminotransferase 
and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level in the 

Ischemic Hepatitis – Intercorrelated Pathology

setting of cardiac decompensation. The first 
24-48 hours are characterized by an unexpected 
rise in AST levels shortly followed by an increase 
in ALT levels. Diagnostic values are 10 up to 
250 times the normal upper limit (5, 12). However, 
the actual diagnostic cut-off limit may vary. 
Another characteristic of IH/HH is a higher level 
of plasma AST compared to ALT, as a direct result 
of higher concentration of AST in zone 3, the 
place where ischemic necrosis develops. There is 
a rapid decrease in AST plasma levels over 
24-48 hours, whereas ALT takes longer (over 
one–two weeks) to return to normal (14).
Serum LDH is reported to be markedly 
elevated in IH/HH, sometimes even more than 
AST/ALT, yet it shortly returns to normal values. 
The early massive rise in LDH level is helpful in 
the differential diagnosis of IH/HH from viral 
hepatitis.
Additional liver tests abnormalities may occur 
in relation to IH/HH severity. The presence of 
elevated total and, more specifically, unconjugated 
bilirubin up to 2-3 mg/dL is a negative prognostic 
marker. Only one third of patients develop 
jaundice (13). One study found high levels of 
bilirubin being correlated with the arterial 
pressure level, but not with cardiac output (19). 
Other liver tests are within the normal range or 
slightly elevated – for example, alkaline 
phosphatase or INR values. An INR level >1.5 
may precede the onset of acute liver failure. 
Abnormal liver tests may be accompanied by 
other altered functional tests as a result of organ 
hypoperfusion. In a study including 182 patients, 
acute renal injury and elevated serum creatinine 
were present in 67% of cases, rhabdomyolysis in 
46% of them, and 25% of patients developed 
ischemic pancreatitis (high levels of creatine￾kinase and lipase, respectively) (20). 
Half of patients with IH/HH in the setting of 
chronic liver diseases may also be at risk of 
developing hepatopulmonary syndrome, a 
complication that carries a poor prognosis (21).
The positive diagnosis of IH/HH relies on the 
currently accepted previously described criteria, 
which are based on characteristic biological tests 
and typical clinical signs of the underlying disease 
(cardiac or pulmonary disease, shock, prior 
subclinical liver disease).
There are several clinical conditions that have 
to be considered in the differential diagnosis of 
rapid increase in aminotransferase level 
10-20x the upper limit of normal:
- acute viral hepatitis or worsening of chronic 
viral hepatitis;
- toxic hepatitis (medication, drugs, 
acetaminophen etc);
- autoimmune hepatitis;
- transient biliary obstructive syndrome, with 
spontaneous gallstone obstruction;
- liver trauma.
In clinical practice, viral hepatitis is a frequent 
condition seen in patients with ischemic heart 
disease and heart failure. 
Several biological elements are helpful to 
distinguish IH from viral hepatitis:
- persistent elevated plasma aminotransferase 
level in viral hepatitis, along with normal/
minimum rise in LDH level;
- ALT/LDH < 1.5 during acute phase of 
hepatitis suggests IH over viral hepatitis (22); 
- elevated serum creatinine is a relatively 
frequent finding in IH (induced by 
hypoperfusion), but not in viral hepatitis (6).
Moreover, certain imaging findings may add 
incremental value to IH diagnostic in difficult 
cases such as dilation of hepatic veins and inferior 
vena cava (23). Liver ultrasound might reveal 
hepatic changes, e.g., liver masses, which are 
accompanied by elevated levels of amino￾transferase or other enzymes.
Outcome and prognosis 
The prognosis of IH may range from complete 
regression of biological changes to short-time 
mortality, being more related to the underlying 
etiology and hemodynamic severity, hypo￾perfusion and hypoxia. Management should 
focus on correcting hypoperfusion and liver 
congestion, which are followed by regression of 
aminotransferase and LDH levels. There is a rapid 
decrease of AST level in 24-48 hours, while ALT 
and LDH plasma levels are reported to slowly 
return to normal values over a period of one to 
two weeks.
Complications may develop in patients with 
prolonged IH/HH, which they are often very 
difficult to manage. Acute hepatic failure may 
develop especially if IH/HH overlaps a chronic 
hepatopathy (hepatic cirrhosis, congestive 
chronic hepatopathy) (7, 24). In intensive care 
units with critically ill patients, IH/HH can be

associated with acute kidney injury (AKI) (25). In 
a recent study on 240 patients with IH/HH, 81% 
developed AKI, more than with half stage 3 AKI. 
In IH/HH patients, AKI correlated with underlying 
disease severity, especially shock, vasoactive 
drugs and elevated lactate level on admission 
(26).
Other IH/HH complications are severe 
hypoglycemia (4% of cases) but also hyper￾glycemia. Hepatopulmonary syndrome, less 
often seen in IH/HH as compared to liver 
cirrhosis, is associated with a worse prognosis of 
IH/HH. Once the liver function returns to normal, 
the hepatopulmonary syndrome is also reduced 
(27).
Approximately 50% of patients with IH/HH 
admitted in ICU have a severe prognosis. A recent 
review identified a 51% mortality rate (6). In 
another study on 38645 patients admitted to 
ICU, of which 1.46% developed IH/HH, the 
mortality rate was 41.1% (9). The causes of death 
are related to worse prognosis of the underlying 
disease and less often to acute liver injury. 
Pathological conditions associated with the 
highest mortality rate are cardiogenic shock and 
septic shock (8, 10). 
Mortality predictors are older age and higher 
severity risk score related to the primary con￾dition; elevated and persistent levels of amino￾transferase and LDH; INR >2; worsened jaundice 
with bilirubin level >3 mg/dL; acute kidney 
injury; and vasopressors use (12). 
Treatment principles 
The main focus in IH/HH treatment addresses 
the underlying pathological conditions leading to 
liver dysfunction: severe heart failure, acute 
circulatory failure and respiratory failure. 
Therapeutic targets, as far as the liver is 
concerned, focus on hypoxia correction and 
increased oxygen supply with improved oxygen 
transport between blood and hepatic cells. 
Tailored therapeutic measures primarily target 
systemic hemodynamic correction by increasing 
cardiac output and arterial pressure, adequate 
vascular fluid replacement and volume expansion 
control, arterial hypoxia correction.
Acute or severe heart failure treatment may 
be the main concern. In patients with significant 
congestion and very low cardiac output, inotropes 
associated with diuretics (dobutamine plus 
furosemide) increase cardiac output, reduce liver 
(and systemic) congestion and improve hepato￾splanchnic circulation (14). Cardiogenic or septic 
shock requires specific measures: inotropes and 
vasoconstrictors; oxygen optimization; interven￾tional treatment in acute myocardial infarction; 
antibiotics. 
Dopamine use in renal or cardiac doses may 
lead to hepatic blood flow increase, although the 
benefits are uncertain (4). Inotrope medication 
may have potential detrimental effects on the 
already compromised cardiac function: 
arrhythmia, cardiac micronecrosis, death.
Excessive use of vasopressors (e.g., norepi­­­￾nephrine) in shock may worsen acute liver injury 
and IH/HH progression. Care must be taken 
when prescribing diuretics to avoid excess volume 
depletion, which may be responsible for reduced 
hepatic perfusion and zone 3 necrosis (12).
Other general measures focus on oxygen 
therapy, relative to hypoxia severity and tissue 
hypoperfusion, glycemic and hyperammonemia 
control.
Acute hepatic injury rarely represents the 
main clinical expression and its prognosis de￾pends on the underlying pathological conditions 
leading to IH/HH. N-acetil cysteine or other 
antioxidants failed to prove their efficiency (12).
Some patients with heart failure were already 
on statin treatment prior to IH/HH episode. They 
might be responsible for elevated aminotransferase 
level, but without the specific pattern of IH/HH. 
Most cardiologists chose to stop the treatment in 
these particular situations. A recent study on 
851 patients admitted to ICU, of which 
87 presented IH/HH, showed that IH/HH had 
developed in 11% of those without statin therapy 
vs. 5% of subjects on statins at admission (26). 
These results need further validation in future 
studies.
CONCLUSIONS
I
schemic hepatitis is a rare pathological condition, 
often difficult to separate from congestive 
hepatopathy. Accurate diagnosis is based on 
rigorous biological and clinical monitoring (rapid 
increase in aminotransferase and lactic-dehi￾drogenase levels) in certain pathological settings. 
Critical patients are prone to develop more 
severe forms of IH/HH, frequently seen in acute 
heart failure, circulatory failure or shock. Patients
