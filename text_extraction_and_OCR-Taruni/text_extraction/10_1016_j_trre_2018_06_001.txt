Background: Currently, there is no consensus on which treatments should be a part of standard deceased-donor
management to improve graft quality and transplantation outcomes. The objective of this systematic review was
to evaluate the effects of treatments of the deceased, solid-organ donor on graft function and survival after trans￾plantation.
Methods: Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane, and Clinicaltrials.gov were systematically searched for randomized con￾trolled trials that compared deceased-donor treatment versus placebo or no treatment.
Results: A total of 33 studies were selected for this systematic review. Eleven studies were included for meta-anal￾yses on three different treatment strategies. The meta-analysis on methylprednisolone treatment in liver donors
(two studies, 183 participants) showed no effect of the treatment on rates of acute rejection. The meta-analysis
on antidiuretic hormone treatment in kidney donors (two studies, 222 participants) indicates no benefit in the
prevention of delayed graft function. The remaining meta-analyses (seven studies, 334 participants) compared
the effects of 10 min of ischaemic preconditioning on outcomes after liver transplantation and showed that isch￾aemic preconditioning improved short-term liver function, but not long-term transplant outcomes.
Conclusions: There is currently insufficient evidence to conclude that any particular drug treatment or any inter￾vention in the deceased donor improves long-term graft or patient survival after transplantation.

1. Introduction
Due to the persistent shortage of organs available for solid organ
transplantation [1], the transplant community has been searching for
possibilities to further expand the donor pool. One way to achieve this
is by accepting organs retrieved from older and higher risk donors,
without compromising good transplantation outcomes. Improving
quality of suboptimal organs from donors after brain death (DBD),
older expanded-criteria donors (ECD), or donors after circulatory
death (DCD) mandates better assessment and optimisation prior to
transplantation. These donors have all suffered cerebral injury, which
leads to a profound systemic inflammatory response [2, 3]. Further￾more, DBD and DCD donors face additional disturbances that threaten
the quality of the future organ grafts.
In DBD donors, an increased intracranial pressure impairs brain per￾fusion and causes herniation of the brain stem. This results in the release
of catecholamines and a cascade of derangements that lead to endothe￾lial dysfunction and inflammation in the potential grafts-to-be [4, 5]. In
addition, the function of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland becomes
impaired, which leads to decreased cortisol, triiodothyronine (T3), insu￾lin, and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) plasma levels in the donor [6, 7].
After herniation of the brain stem, a haemodynamically unstable state
will follow that requires fluid resuscitation and often inotropic support.
In DCD donors, there is no catecholamine release. Instead, withdrawal of
medical support results in a significant blood pressure drop until circu￾latory arrest. This period of circulatory arrest is followed by a in most
countries medico-legal five-minute no-touch period prior to confirma￾tion of death, which adds extra warm ischaemic injury and threatens
the quality of the potential grafts. In addition to these donor-related in￾juries, the grafts-to-be subsequently endure a period of preservation
and cold ischaemia that are further detrimental to the organ quality.
To improve transplant outcomes in solid organ transplantation, an
optimised and more organ-protective Intensive Care regimen should

be adopted. In the last decade, such a strategy has increasingly become
important since donor age and comorbidities have increased signifi￾cantly in most countries. In deceased donor care, this has led to the con￾sideration of numerous treatment options aspiring improvement of
graft function and survival after transplantation. Unfortunately, clinical
implementation has not happened, whilst a lot of controversy still exists
about which treatment could actually benefit donor organs potentially
improving transplant outcomes.
The purpose of this systematic review is to provide an update on all
systematically tested clinical interventions in the deceased donor and
their impact on graft function and/or survival following solid organ
transplantation. This review will concern any clinical treatment regi￾men that was carried out in either DBD or DCD donors using either spe￾cific drugs, fluids, or procedures to reduce donor organ injury prior to
organ preservation and transplantation.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Selection criteria
RCTs or quasi-RCTs (trials in which the allocation method is not truly
random) were selected that compared differences in graft function and
survival between pre organ retrieval-treated, deceased, adult (16 years
or older) solid-organ donors (including DCD, DBD, and ECD donors) to
untreated or placebo-controlled donors. Primary outcomes for this sys￾tematic review were graft function and patient and graft survival. Sec￾ondary outcome parameters were surrogate markers of organ injury.
Exclusion criteria for this systematic review were 1. articles not in
English; 2. duplicate studies; 3. living donors; 4. average donor age b
16 years old; 5. studies with pregnant participants; 6. animal studies;
7. tissue transplantation; 8. donor treatment after graft procurement;
9. ex-situ treatment of the graft; 10. treatment of the recipient; and
11. no information on organ function or survival.
2.2. Search methods for identification of studies
This systematic review was performed according to the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
guidelines [8]. Potential RCTs were identified using electronic and man￾ual search strategies. The final electronic literature searches were per￾formed in Pubmed (5 Nov 2016), Embase (5 Nov 2016), and the
Cochrane library (7 Nov 2016). The ClinicalTrials.gov register was also
searched (7 Nov 2016) to identify unpublished or ongoing trials. The
search was limited to RCTs with a highly sensitive search-strategy filter.
The bibliographies of identified studies and reviews were manually
searched for additional trials. A qualified librarian reviewed the final
search strategy. The search strategy for each consulted database is avail￾able in the supplementary data (Fig. S1, Table S1 and S2).
2.3. Data extraction and validity assessment
All identified records were screened on title and abstract after re￾moval of duplicates with an algorithm provided by Refworks
(ProQuest-LCC, USA). Full articles of selected records were retrieved
and assessed for eligibility; disagreements were resolved by consensus.
Abstracts not providing information on the study type or outcome pa￾rameters were retrieved for full-text evaluation. Study information
was extracted independently by two reviewers. The risk of bias assess￾ment was performed according to the Cochrane risk of bias tool [9]. The
assessment of study quality included random sequence generation, allo￾cation concealment, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias,
reporting bias, and “other” bias. Quality assessments were performed
independently and disagreements were resolved through discussion.
2.4. Data synthesis
Outcome parameters of interest for all transplanted solid organs
were: patient and graft survival; development of primary dysfunction,
sometimes subdivided in either primary non-function or initial poor
function; acute rejection; Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or hospital stay;
and post-operative complications (such as post-operative infections or
biliary complications, Table 1). Organ-specific parameters of interest
were: creatinine clearance, serum creatinine, and delayed graft function
(DGF, measured as the need for renal replacement therapy including
haemodialysis (HD) or haemofiltration (HF) in the first week post trans￾plantation) (kidney); aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine amino￾transferase (ALT), albumin, alkaline phosphatase (AF), bilirubin,
gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (ɣGT), and lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) levels, and International Normalised Ratio(INR) (liver); left ven￾tricular function, and left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and HF re￾quirement (heart); and PaO2/FiO2 ratio, compliance (plateau pressure
at the end of respiration), and organ utilization rates as an indirect
way of assessing graft function (lung). Qualitative assessment was per￾formed for single studies that could not be grouped for meta-analyses.
For studies that could be grouped, a forest plot was constructed to assess
the heterogeneity, using Cochran's Q test and the I2
-test (considered
significant when p b .1 or I2 N 30%). A random-effects analysis model
was applied, followed by the Mantel-Haenszel test to calculate cumula￾tive relative risk ratios for dichotomous variables. As no more than four
studies were included per meta-analysis, funnel plot analyses could not
be constructed to distinguish potential asymmetry. All statistical analy￾ses were performed with Review Manager v5.3 (The Cochrane Collabo￾ration 2014).
3. Results
3.1. Literature search and summary of included studies
From 7309 hits in total, 62 studies were assessed. As 29 studies
failed to meet our inclusion criteria, a total of 33 articles were in￾cluded in this systematic review (Fig. 1, Table 1, Table S3). Even
though the search strategy was aimed towards all solid organs,
only studies on kidney, liver, heart, and lung transplantations were
found. In addition, we identified 13 trials that were still ongoing or
did not yet publish results (Table 2). As none of the included studies
involved interventions in DCD donors, this systematic review de￾scribes only trials in DBD donors.
The following treatment strategies for DBD donors were identified:
anti-oxidant treatment [10–13], enteral feeding [14], organ retrieval
techniques [15, 16], haemodynamic support [17–24], mild therapeutic
hypothermia (MTH) [25], immunosuppressants [26–31], ischaemic pre￾conditioning (IPC) [32–39], a lung protection strategy [40, 41], and T3
administration [42]. Table 1 shows a summary of these included studies,
while Table S4 shows the risk of bias for these trials. In 16 studies, the
methods for patient selection and allocation concealment were ade￾quately performed and described. Eight studies used a placebo-con￾trolled group, whereas the remaining studies had either non￾treatment groups (n = 20) or compared the intervention to a conven￾tional treatment (n = 5).
3.2. Studies that could not be included for meta-analyses
Twenty-two studies [10–18, 21–28, 31, 32, 40–42] were not in￾cluded for meta-analyses because the type of intervention or outcome
parameter could not be compared to other trials included in this review.
None of the studies reported a significant effect of the treatment or in￾tervention on ICU or hospital stay.
Four studies tested effects of anti-oxidant treatments in DBD do￾nors on graft function [10–13]. Treatments with N-acetylcysteine
[12] and L-alanyl-glutamine [10] showed no effects following kidney

and liver transplantation, respectively. Studies on Ascorbic acid
treatment [11] and donor ventilation with sevoflurane [13] showed
improved short-term liver function but did not report effects on pa￾tient or graft survival.
Two trials investigated two different hepatic retrieval techniques.
Chui et al. [15] showed no differences between single (aortic) or double
(aortic and portal) perfusion on liver and kidney transplantation out￾comes, whilst D'Amico et al. [16] showed superiority of the double per￾fusion technique, evidenced by improved short-term liver function,
lower rates of re-transplantation, and improved six-month graft and pa￾tient survival.
Six out of eight studies on hemodynamic support of the deceased
donor could not be grouped for meta-analyses [17, 18, 21–24]. Dopa￾mine treatment improved long-term graft survival after heart [18], but
not kidney transplantation [17], despite a reduced incidence of DGF of
renal organ grafts [17]. Prostaglandin I2 treatment improved short￾term liver function, but failed to improve patient or graft survival [21].
Protocolised fluid administration did not alter recipient survival after
solid organ transplantation [22]. The use of the colloid hydroxyl-ethyl
starch (HES) (of unknown molecular weight) did not affect liver func￾tion following transplantation [23]; treatment with low molecular
weight-HES did increase rates of DGF following renal transplantation
[24].
Four out of six trials on the use of immunosuppressive drugs could
not be clustered. Administration of neither methylprednisolone and cy￾clophosphamide [27, 28], nor cyclophosphamide [31], nor prednisolone
[26] improved renal transplantation outcomes.
Of the seven studies found on IPC treatment in liver donors, the only
study investigating five minutes of IPC showed no benefits following
liver transplantation.
The remaining trials investigated possible clinical benefits of enteral
feeding [14], MTH [25], albuterol [41] or T3 [42] administration, and a
protective lung ventilation strategy [40]. Neither enteral feeding [14],
nor albuterol administration [41], nor protective lung ventilation [40]
improved survival rates of recipients after heart, lung, liver, or kidney
transplantations. MTH decreased the incidence of DGF after kidney
transplantation [25]. Lastly, T3 administration did not improve liver
function following transplantation [42].
3.3. Studies included for meta-analyses
Eleven studies were identified for further meta-analyses. None of the
studies that were included for meta-analyses reported a significant ef￾fect of the treatment or intervention on ICU or hospital stay. The
meta-analysis on the effects of donor treatment with ADH included
222 participants [19, 20] and showed no difference in the development
of DGF after kidney transplantation between treated and untreated DBD
donors (Fig. 2).
The meta-analysis on donor methylprednisolone treatment versus
placebo or no treatment included a total of 183 participants [29, 30]
and showed similar acute rejection rates of liver grafts retrieved from
donors treated either with or without methylprednisolone (Fig. 3).
Ten meta-analyses were included on the effects of 10 min of IPC
versus no treatment in the liver, with a total of 335 participants
from seven trials [33–39]. Results show that IPC treatment did not
influence one-year (Fig. 4A,B) or two-year graft and patient survival
(Fig. S1A,B). In the short-term, IPC treatment improved AST levels
on day one and international normalised ratio (INR) levels on day
three after surgery (Fig. 5A,C), but did not affect INR (Fig. 5B) or bil￾irubin levels (Fig. S1E) one day post-operatively. Also, the incidence
of primary non-function or initial poor function was not different
between treated and untreated grafts (Fig. S1C,D). The risk of bias
for included studies is described in Table S4. In general, the studies
included in the meta-analyses were judged to have a relatively high
risk of bias.
4. Discussion
This systematic review provides an update on the existing evidence
of treatments that were applied to deceased organ donors and aimed to
improve graft quality and survival after kidney, liver, heart, and lung
transplantations. Our meta-analyses found no consistent evidence to
support that any specific donor-management strategy or treatment in
DBD donors benefited outcomes after transplantation (see Fig. 6 for an
overview of all included studies per organ). This finding is in line with
previous and older reviews published on this topic [43–47].
4.1. Anti-oxidants
Brain death and IRI are associated with increased levels of reactive
oxygen species (ROS), which play a central role in the deleterious effects
following transplantation [48]. Therefore, the use of anti-oxidants to
scavenge ROS or support cellular detoxification appears to be an intui￾tively sound strategy to limit IRI. However, none of the four compounds
tested improved survival rates following kidney (N-acetylcysteine) [12]
or liver (L-alanyl-glutamine, ascorbic acid, sevoflurane) [10, 11, 13]
transplantation, even though ascorbic acid [11] and donor ventilation
with sevoflurane [13] improved short-term liver function. In addition,
Minou et al. showed that sevoflurane did have protective effects in mar￾ginal livers with various degrees of hepatic steatosis [13]. Recently, a
RCT on simultaneous kidney and pancreas transplantations showed
that treatment with 600 mg alfa-lipoic acid in both donors and recipi￾ents resulted in decreased inflammatory markers in the transplanted
grafts [49]. These promising results may encourage more trials with
anti-oxidant treatment strategies, either in the donor, during graft pres￾ervation or at time of reperfusion.
4.2. Enteral feeding
For critically ill patients, enteral feeding is the preferred route for nu￾tritional support [50]. However, nutritional support is usually withheld
in DBD donors due to suggested negative side effects of both enteral and
parenteral feeding. Negative effect of enteral feeding are thought to be
impaired nutritional uptake as a result of the inflammatory response
taking place in the bowel of DBD donors [51]. Alternatively, parenteral
feeding is related to metabolic, infectious, and mechanical complica￾tions [52]. The only RCT on this topic compared fasting of the DBD
donor to enteral feeding with a diet containing fatty acids, antioxidants,
and glutamine. This study shows that transplant outcomes and inflam￾matory parameters were not different between groups following on av￾erage 12.6 h of enteral feeding [14]. Effects of nutritional duration were
not investigated. As about 30% of the donors were able to metabolise en￾teral nutrition without negative side effects [14], enteral feeding ap￾pears to be safe method for nutritional support in DBD donors.
4.3. Organ retrieval techniques
During organ procurement, there are two techniques to flush-out
and perfuse the liver graft. The classic, dual perfusion technique flushes
the graft via both the aorta and portal vein [53]. Alternatively, most cen￾tres now use single aortic perfusion as an simplified, alternative method
that is of particular interest during multiple organ harvesting or split
liver transplantation [16], followed by additional back-table flush of
the liver. The two RCTs that compared these techniques show conflict￾ing results [15, 16]. Chui et al. [15] found no differences between the
techniques following liver and kidneys transplantation, while D'Amico
et al. [16] found an improved function of marginal livers after dual per￾fusion. Unfortunately, it is challenging to draw conclusions from these
studies: Chui et al. did not provide a full report on their study design,
whilst D'Amico et al. focused primarily on marginal donors, which
makes extrapolation of these results to the general donor population

difficult. In conclusion, there is currently no strong evidence suggesting
superiority of either perfusion technique.
4.4. Haemodynamic support
Diabetes insipidus is a common finding amongst DBD donors and
may cause haemodynamic instability in the donor due to hypovolaemia
and electrolyte disturbances [20]. However, treatment strategies to im￾prove haemodynamic instability in the donor are frequently based on
personal experience as there is no general consensus on what treatment
is most effective.
Treatment of hypovolaemia with crystalloids has been suggested to
cause organ oedema, diminished organ perfusion, and impaired oxygen
diffusion in the lungs. Therefore, the use of colloids was introduced to
avoid this build-up of extravascular fluids. In DBD donor care, two
RCTs studied the effects of donor treatment with the colloid HES. The
study by Randell et al. [23] showed no difference in graft function
after the administration of HES (unknown molecular weight) compared
to saline prior to liver transplantation. However, treatment of DBD do￾nors with low molecular weight HES resulted in harmful short-term ef￾fects in kidney grafts [24]. This result has led to the notion that HES
should not be administered to potential kidney donors. However, it
should be noted that both studies have a high risk of bias, which may
have influenced the results and possibly their interpretation. A different
approach to achieve donor euvolaemia is to monitor the pulse pressure
variation and correct hypotension according to a protocol that includes
fluid or vasopressive drug administration [22]. However, implementa￾tion of this protocol failed to improve the recipient survival rate or num￾ber of organs transplanted per donor.
Alternatively, five RCTs tested the effects of pharmaceuticals as a
means to provide haemodynamic support. Firstly, administration of
ADH did not improve graft function (Fig. 2), but did result in decreased
urine output and, therefore, the need for fluid therapy. Secondly, admin￾istration of dopamine in DBD donors had a positive effect on short-term
renal graft function [17], whilst in heart transplantation it improved
long-term graft and patient survival [18]. Finally, administration of
prostaglandin I2 improved transaminase levels immediately and one
day after liver transplantation, but failed to improve graft survival [21].
In conclusion, unstable haemodynamic parameters should be
treated appropriately with volume replacement and haemodynamic re￾suscitation. However, volume replacement with HES should be used
with caution, especially when kidney donation is considered. Haemody￾namic support using dopamine appears to be beneficial in heart and
possibly in kidney transplantation. Thus, further studies on the use of
dopamine as part of standard donor care and its effects on other organ
grafts is desirable.
4.5. Hypothermia during donor management
Promising results published by Niemann et al. show that MTH of the
deceased donor (cooling of the donor from 37 °C to 34–35 °C at the In￾tensive Care Unit) preserved kidney function during donor manage￾ment in the Intensive Care Unit, with decreased DGF rates after
transplantation. These results are in line with a retrospective cohort
study on patients with a myocardial infarction, for whom MTH treat￾ment prior to and during their percutaneous coronary intervention im￾proved survival rates and preserved renal function [54]. However, these
protective effects of MTH could not be reproduced in RCTs on patients
with cardiac arrests [55, 56] or intracranial aneurysms [57]. Long-term
effects of MTH treatment are eagerly awaited before implementation
of this technique can be considered as standard donor care [25]. Fur￾thermore, the study by Niemann only included statically cold-stored
kidneys, whilst hypothermic machine perfusion has demonstrated to
significantly reduce DGF and improve graft survival, especially in older
and higher-risk donor kidneys [58]. Therefore, the question arises
whether both treatment regimens are necessary and which one is
more cost-effective. Recently, a new trial has started that will compare
the effects of donor MTH with hypothermic machine perfusion on
graft function after transplantation62.

4.6. Immunosuppression
Brain death results in pro-inflammatory changes, both systemically
and in the organ grafts [4]. Additionally, endogenous cortisol levels de￾crease after the onset of brain death [59, 60]. Therefore, it is conceivable
that donor treatment with immunosuppressive drugs could prevent
pro-inflammatory changes and improve graft quality, as was suggested
in experimental animal studies [61, 62] and a large retrospective cohort
study [63]. However, our meta-analysis on the effects of prednisolone
treatment showed no changes in the frequency of acute rejection fol￾lowing liver transplantation (Fig. 3). Furthermore, immunosuppressive
drug treatment did neither improve long-term graft function, nor pa￾tient, nor graft survival following kidney and liver transplantation
[26–31], despite a decrease in DBD-related pro-inflammatory changes
in these organs. In addition, the one study that investigated the effects
of immunosuppressive therapy in marginal donors (higher donor
age), found no differences in kidney function or graft survival [19]. Fi￾nally, the short-term benefits of prednisolone treatment in liver graft

as observed by Kotsch et al. [30], could not be reproduced in a similar
study by Amatschek et al. [29]. In conclusion, these studies do not sup￾port the routine use of methylprednisolone alone, or in combination
with cyclophosphamide, in the management of DBD donors.
4.7. Ischaemic preconditioning
Ischaemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is an unavoidable deleterious
process during organ transplantation. Initially, the organs suffer from a
period of ischaemia during procurement, followed by injury during sub￾sequent reperfusion in the recipient. Murry et al. first introduced the
concept of IPC as a method to induce transient ischaemia, preparing
the organs for subsequent IRI [64]. We identified eight studies on IPC,
all performed prior to liver transplantation. Pooled data from our
meta-analyses shows a short-term benefit of ten-minute IPC treatment
that seems independent of the duration of warm ischemia, evidenced by
improved post-operative AST and INR levels. Even though long-term ef￾fects on patient and graft survival were lacking and the different studies
showed some conflicting results, data from our meta-analysis highly
suggests a potential benefit of IPC prior to liver transplantation, particu￾larly as AST levels in the first week after transplantation have been cor￾related to early graft survival (b3 months) [65]. The RCT by Franchello et
al. reported improved AST levels in a subgroup of marginal donors
(N65 years old and/or with steatosis) [38]. Further studies powered to
detect changes in short-term survival rates and adjusted for graft qual￾ity should be performed to elucidate whether IPC should be included in
standard donor care. Furthermore, there are currently several on-going
trials investigating remote IPC, a technique where (repetitive) cycles of
ischaemia are applied to a remote organ or tissue such as a limb with,
consequentially, a possible wider therapeutic timeframe in the donor
(Table 2).
4.8. Lung protection strategies
DBD donors are at increased risk of pulmonary damage caused by in￾creased pulmonary hydrostatic pressure, catecholamine release, and
pro-inflammatory changes [66]. However, the optimal lung ventilation
strategy in decreased donor care has been a topic of controversy [67].
Conventionally, high tidal volumes (TV) (10–12 mL/kg) were applied,
ensuring hypocapnia and a decrease in intracranial hypertension, and
combined with low positive end-expiratory pressures (PEEP) (3–5 cm
H2O) to provide optimal oxygenation [66]. Recent studies on patients
with the acute respiratory distress syndrome support an alternative
strategy with a low TV and high PEEP, as this strategy appears to have
improved outcomes of acute lung injury by reducing ventilation re￾lated-injury and preventing atelectasis [66, 68]. Based on these studies,
Mascia et al. studied this protective ventilation strategy with low TV
(6–8 mL/kg) and high PEEP (8–10 cm H2O) in DBD donor care [66].
Even though this ventilation strategy did not improve patient survival,
there was a significant increase (27–54%) in the number of lungs
transplanted [40]. These data have supported the implementation of
this protective lung ventilation strategy as the preferred ventilation
strategy for deceased donors, according to the recent guidelines from
the Eurotransplant region as well as the American Thoracic Society
[69, 70].
An alternative strategy to protect the lungs is the use of beta-2-ad￾renergic agonists, which increase the rate of fluid clearance from the
lungs, potentially lowering the risk of pulmonary oedema and subse￾quent infiltrates, and improving oxygenation capacity [71]. However,
treatment of the donor with aerosolised albuterol did not improve
lung function, recipient survival, or lung utilization rates [41]. A sub￾group analysis of marginal donor lungs only even indicated lower lung
utilization in the albuterol-treated group. Finally, albuterol treatment
resulted in a lower kidney utilization rate of 77% vs. 88% in the pla￾cebo-treated group. As such, donor treatment with albuterol does not
seem to improve lung function and may have a negative impact on mar￾ginal donor lungs as well as kidney grafts.
4.9. Triiodothyronine
Brain death causes ischaemia of the brain and subsequent cessation
of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. As a result, plasma levels of the ac￾tive thyroid hormone T3 diminish in a matter of hours, whereas variable
levels of levothyroxine (T4), reverse T3, and thyroid stimulating hor￾mone have been observed [43]. A large retrospective cohort of 66,629
donors suggested that T3 treatment improved the haemodynamic pro￾file of donors and increased the number of organs transplanted [72].
However, the only RCT that has evaluated post-transplantation graft
function failed to show any effects of T3 therapy on liver function [42].
During the screening process, we did identify nine RCTs that assessed
effects of T3 treatment on haemodynamic stability in the donor. Of
these studies, none found any differences in haemodynamic donor pa￾rameters or inotropic needs [42, 73–80]. As a result, the current national
guidelines of National Health Service Blood and Transplant in the UK no
longer advise administration of a rather costly T3 as part of the DBD
donor management.

4.10. Limitations of this review
Firstly, the number of RCTs that investigated treatment strategies in
the donor and their impact on graft function and survival after trans￾plantation is limited. Furthermore, as our search strategy focused on
donor treatment only, potentially promising treatment strategies of
the graft after procurement and during preservation were excluded
that may be of a pre-transplant treatment potential. In addition, several
studies we did include were performed with a low number of partici￾pants, did not report power calculations or were underpowered to de￾tect changes in the outcome parameters as stipulated in this review.
Consequentially, potential effects on organ function or survival might
have been missed and interpretation of the data from these studies
should be done with caution. Furthermore, we acknowledge that
some outcome parameters, such as plasma bilirubin to assess liver func￾tion or number of organs transplanted in the case of the kidney, are pos￾sibly weakly correlated to organ injury. However, as these endpoints
were assessed in conjunction with other biomarkers, the prognostic
value of these endpoints is strengthened. The few number of studies
also limited us from assessing the risk of publication bias or perform
subgroup analyses. Therefore, drawing conclusions from these studies
is risky, particularly when grouping for meta-analyses was not possible.
Additionally, we found limited studies on lung transplantation, and no
studies on pancreas or intestinal transplantations. Lastly, we realise
that several promising treatment strategies published in relevant ani￾mal models are not included in this article. However, we believe that
these studies were outside the scope of this review as interpretation
of these results are not yet influential in clinical decision making in de￾ceased donor care.
5. Conclusions
The current global shortage of suitable donor organs and often un￾certainty which organ to accept or decline, underlines the need for op￾timisation of deceased donor care. Treatment strategies aim at
reducing the detrimental effects of haemodynamic, hormonal, inflam￾matory, and metabolic disturbances prior to organ retrieval. Better con￾ditioning of the grafts-to-be and reducing, or even preventing, donor￾related injury prior to preservation and transplantation have become
important goals to transplant higher risk donor organs, without
compromising outcomes after transplantation. Unfortunately, current
donor management protocols may vary considerably per centre and
are based on low-level evidence. In this systematic review, we could
not find consistent evidence supporting that any individual treatment
that has been tested until now will protect donor organs or improve sur￾vival after transplantation. More organised and defined RCTs are re￾quired to identify and validate possible benefits of innovative
treatments before clinical implementation can be recommended as
part of standard donor care. We feel that a concerted action between
professionals in Intensive Care and organ transplantation is needed to
gain better insight and stimulate clinically relevant interventions in
DBD donors.
