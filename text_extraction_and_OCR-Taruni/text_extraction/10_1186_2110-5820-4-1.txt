Lung ultrasound in the critically ill
Daniel A Lichtenstein
Abstract
Lung ultrasound is a basic application of critical ultrasound, defined as a loop associating urgent diagnoses with
immediate therapeutic decisions. It requires the mastery of ten signs: the bat sign (pleural line), lung sliding
(yielding seashore sign), the A-line (horizontal artifact), the quad sign, and sinusoid sign indicating pleural effusion,
the fractal, and tissue-like sign indicating lung consolidation, the B-line, and lung rockets indicating interstitial
syndrome, abolished lung sliding with the stratosphere sign suggesting pneumothorax, and the lung point indicating
pneumothorax. Two more signs, the lung pulse and the dynamic air bronchogram, are used to distinguish atelectasis
from pneumonia. All of these disorders were assessed using CT as the “gold standard” with sensitivity and specificity
ranging from 90% to 100%, allowing ultrasound to be considered as a reasonable bedside “gold standard” in the
critically ill. The BLUE-protocol is a fast protocol (<3 minutes), which allows diagnosis of acute respiratory failure. It
includes a venous analysis done in appropriate cases. Pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and pneumothorax yield specific profiles. Pulmonary edema, e.g., yields anterior
lung rockets associated with lung sliding, making the “B-profile.” The FALLS-protocol adapts the BLUE-protocol to acute
circulatory failure. It makes sequential search for obstructive, cardiogenic, hypovolemic, and distributive shock using
simple real-time echocardiography (right ventricle dilatation, pericardial effusion), then lung ultrasound for assessing a
direct parameter of clinical volemia: the apparition of B-lines, schematically, is considered as the endpoint for fluid
therapy. Other aims of lung ultrasound are decreasing medical irradiation: the LUCIFLR program (most CTs in ARDS or
trauma can be postponed), a use in traumatology, intensive care unit, neonates (the signs are the same than in adults),
many disciplines (pulmonology, cardiology…), austere countries, and a help in any procedure (thoracentesis). A 1992,
cost-effective gray-scale unit, without Doppler, and a microconvex probe are efficient. Lung ultrasound is a holistic
discipline for many reasons (e.g., one probe, perfect for the lung, is able to scan the whole-body). Its integration
can provide a new definition of priorities. The BLUE-protocol and FALLS-protocol allow simplification of expert
echocardiography, a clear advantage when correct cardiac windows are missing.

Lung ultrasound in the critically ill
The possibility of exploring the lung using ultrasound, at
the bedside and noninvasively, is gaining popularity
among intensivists. Lung ultrasound would be of minor
interest if the usual tools (bedside radiography, CT) did
not have drawbacks (irradiation, low information content
for radiography, need for transportation…). This review
will show that ultrasound can be used instead of CT in
many cases.
We used ultrasound first in 1983, on occasion in François
Fraisse’s ICU in 1985–1989, then since 1989 in François
Jardin’s ICU, using the on-site 1982 ADR-4000 devoted to
cardiac assessment, in actual fact suitable for whole body
and lung assessment and not larger than nowadays laptops
[1]. At this time, although an old idea [2], ultrasound was
not routine in the ICUs and had neglected this vital
organ [3]. Many doctors thought that lung ultrasound
was unfeasible [4,5]. For demonstrating that this dogma
was wrong, deciphering the artifact code was the easy
part, but publishing was the hard one, far from finished.
We will briefly consider the elements of this code, then
major clinical uses. Correspondence: D.Licht@free.fr

Lung ultrasound is part of critical ultrasound, defined
as a whole-body approach using simple machines, one
universal probe, new applications [6,7]. Our priority
was to publish lung ultrasound, leaving little time for
developing basic fields (search for blood in trauma,
venous line insertion…).
Seven principles of lung ultrasound
1) Lung (and critical) ultrasound is performed at best
using simple equipment.
2) In the thorax, gas and fluids have opposite locations,
or are mingled by pathologic processes, generating
artifacts.
3) The lung is the most voluminous organ.
Standardized areas can be defined [8].
4) All signs arise from the pleural line.
5) Static signs are mainly artifactual [9,10].
6) The lung is a vital organ. The signs arising from the
pleural line are foremost dynamic.
7) Almost all acute life-threatening disorders abut the
pleural line, explaining the potential of lung
ultrasound.
Ten signs
The Japanese microconvex probe we use is directly
applied to the intercostal space. In the BLUE-protocol,
three standardized points are the upper BLUE-point,
lower BLUE-point and PLAPS-point [8] (Figure 1). In
ARDS (Pink-protocol), a more comprehensive analysis
includes four stages of investigation (anterior, lateral,
posterior, apical). Ten signs are currently assessed. All
our studies directly compared ultrasound with CT.
The pleural line generates the bat sign, a permanent
landmark visible in all circumstances (agitated, bariatric
patients, subcutaneous emphysema…). It indicates the
parietal pleura (Figure 2).
The normal lung surface (Figure 2) associates lung slid￾ing with horizontal repetitions of the pleural line, called
A-lines. They indicate gas (physiological or free). Lung
sliding is a to-and-fro movement at the pleural line,
spreading below. The M-mode helps to understand
that this movement is relative to superficial tissues (sea￾shore sign). Lung-sliding indicates that the pleural line also
contains the visceral pleura. Lung-sliding, physiologically
more discrete at the upper parts, can be very discrete in
pathological conditions. Some filters, especially average, dy￾namic noise, can make discrete lung-sliding more diffi￾cult to distinguish. We usually bypass all filters.
Pleural effusion, a familiar field [1,11], became of interest
to intensivists only recently. Our short probe is applied at
the PLAPS-point, a posterior area accessible in supine
patients, locating all free effusions, regardless their volume
[8]. This direct approach generates standardized signs:
the quad and sinusoid sign. The deep boundary of the
collection is regular, roughly parallel to the pleural line,
and is called the lung line (visceral pleura). This draws the
quad sign (Figure 3). The lung-line moves toward the
pleural line on inspiration. This draws the sinusoid sign,
which also indicates a low viscosity, allowing fine needle
insertion if needed (Figure 3). Our definition makes
independent of the effusion color, traditionally anechoic:
the most severe cases are echoic: empyema, hemothorax.
For pleural effusions, sensitivity is 93%, specificity 97%
[12,13]. Safe fluid withdrawal is possible even in radio￾occult effusions in ventilated patients [12]. Small effusions
Figure 1 Areas of investigation and the BLUE-points. Two hands placed this way (size equivalent to the patient’s hands, upper hand
touching the clavicle, thumbs excluded) correspond to the location of the lung, and allow three standardized points to be defined. The upper￾BLUE-point is at the middle of the upper hand. The lower-BLUE-point is at the middle of the lower palm. The PLAPS-point is defined by the inter￾section of: a horizontal line at the level of the lower BLUE-point; a vertical line at the posterior axillary line. Small probes, such as this Japanese
microconvex one (1992), allow positioning posterior to this line as far as possible in supine patients, providing more sensitive detection of pos￾terolateral alveolar or pleural syndromes (PLAPS). The diaphragm is usually at the lower end of the lower hand. Extract from “Whole body ultra￾sonography in the critically ill” (2010 Ed, Chapter 14), with kind permission of Springer Science.

can be withdrawn for diagnostic purpose (even if they
appear smaller on CT), provided a 15-mm inspiratory
distance is respected [12]. This safety distance allows
fluid withdrawal without precise volume assessments,
yet rough assessment is possible [14]. We don’t use
ultrasound during thoracentesis.
Lung consolidations are fluid disorders and, therefore, are
easily traversed by ultrasound. This old potential [2,15,16],
long underused in ICUs, benefits from a standardized
approach. Lung consolidations touch the wall in 98% of
cases [17], arise at any site, making ultrasound sensitivity
dependent on the site, size, time spent. Most cases (90%)
Figure 2 Normal lung surface. Left: Scan of the intercostal space. The ribs (vertical arrows). Rib shadows are displayed below. The pleural line
(upper, horizontal arrows), a horizontal hyperechoic line, half a centimeter below the rib line in adults. The proportions are the same in neonates.
The association of ribs and pleural line make a solid landmark called the bat sign. The pleural line indicates the parietal pleura in all cases. Below
the pleural line, this horizontal repetition artifact of the pleural line has been called the A-line (lower, small horizontal arrows). The A-line indicates
that air (gas more precisely) is the component visible below the pleural line. Right: M-mode reveals the seashore sign, which indicates that the
lung moves at the chest wall. The seashore sign therefore indicates that the pleural line also is the visceral pleura. Above the pleural line, the
motionless chest wall displays a stratified pattern. Below the pleural line, the dynamics of lung sliding show this sandy pattern. Note that both
images are strictly aligned, of importance in critical settings. Both images, i.e., lung sliding plus A-lines make the A-profile (when found at the
anterior chest wall). They give basic information on the level of capillary pressure. Extract from “Whole body ultrasonography in the critically ill”

Figure 3 Pleural effusion. Left and middle: minute pleural effusion at the PLAPS-point. Below the pleural line, a line regular and roughly parallel
to the pleural line can be seen: the lung line, indicating the visceral pleura (arrows). This line, together with the pleural line and the shadow of the
ribs, display a kind of quad: the quad sign. Right: M-mode shows a movement of the lung line (white arrows) toward the pleural line (black arrows)
on inspiration—the sinusoid sign, indicating also a free pleural effusion, and a viscosity enabling the use of small caliper needle if thoracentesis is
envisaged. E, expiration. Quantitative data: this effusion found at the PLAPS-point has an expiratory thickness of roughly 13 mm, i.e., an expectedly small
volume (study in progress). A 15-mm distance is our minimum required for safe diagnostic or therapeutic puncture, allowing to simplify the problem
of modeling the real volume of an effusion (Ref. 14). Extract from “Whole body ultrasonography in the critically ill” (2010 Ed, Chapter 15), with

locate, however, at the PLAPS-point [17]. In the critically
ill, consolidations are nontranslobar or translobar, an
important distinction because this generates different
signs, each quite specific (Figure 4). The sign of nontranslo￾bar consolidation (most cases) is the shred sign: the border
between consolidated and aerated lung is irregular, drawing
the fractal line, fully opposed to the lung line. The sign of
translobar consolidation is the tissue-like sign: it looks like
liver. Both signs allow for 90% sensitivity (as explained) and
98% specificity [17]. Other signs are reserved for difficult
cases [18]. The dynamic air bronchogram [17] and the lung
pulse, which visualizes heart beats at the pleural line
through a noninflating lung, can distinguish pneumonia
from atelectasis. For quantitative data, see Figure 4.
Interstitial syndrome is a disorder rarely recognized
with usual tools. Intensivists don’t devote much energy to
its detection, yet this application has basic, unexpected
potential. Our updated definition of the B-line requires
three constant and four quite constant criteria [19]. The
B-line is always a comet-tail artifact, always arises
from the pleural line, and always moves in concert
with lung-sliding. It is almost always long, well-defined,
laser-like, hyperechoic, erasing A-lines (Figure 5). This
definition distinguishes it from all other comet-tail
artifacts. Briefly, air and water are simultaneously hit
by ultrasound beams, as occurring when subpleural
interlobular septa are edematous [20]. Three or more B-lines
between two ribs are called lung-rockets. Lung-rockets
correlate with interstitial syndrome with 93% accuracy
using alveolar-interstitial radiographic changes as reference,
and full accuracy using CT [20]. Up to 3–4 B-lines are
called septal rockets, correlated with Kerley B-lines [21].
Twice as many, called ground-glass rockets, correlate with
ground-glass areas [20]. In the BLUE-protocol, only
anterolateral lung-rockets are considered: posterior
interstitial changes can be due to gravity alone. Harmonics
of modern machines can alter B-lines. The BLUE-protocol
can distinguish hemodynamic pulmonary edema from
ARDS, COPD, and rule out pneumothorax [22,23] as
confirmed [24-27].
Diagnosis of pneumothorax requires three steps.
Abolished lung-sliding, long described in horses [28],
is found anteriorly in quite all significant cases in supine
patients [29]. It has a 95% sensitivity (100% if revisiting
methodology) and 100% negative predictive value [30].
Pneumothorax therefore is confidently discounted each
time lung-sliding is present, as confirmed [31-34].
Lung-sliding can be extremely moderate, up to the
lung-pulse, an equivalent of lung-sliding when searching
for pneumothorax. Pneumothorax generates a completely
motionless pleural line using real-time. M-mode shows a
standardized stratified pattern below and above the pleural
line: the stratosphere sign (Figure 6). Dyspnea generates
interfering movements above the pleural line. Vascular
probes are usually used, but our microconvex probe has no
drawbacks, plus the advantage of immediate whole-body
assessment. Abolished lung-sliding is everything but
specific: inflammatory adherences (i.e., ARDS), atelectasis
(one-lung intubation), chronic adherences, fibrosis, phrenic
palsy, jet ventilation, cardiopulmonary arrest, apnea, esopha￾geal intubation, inappropriate settings, inappropriate
probes are usual factors, and frequent in critically ill
patients. The positive predictive value of abolished lung￾sliding, only 87% in a general population [30], falls to
56% in the critically ill [35], and to 27% in patients
with respiratory failure [36]. The notion of ultrasound
Figure 4 Lung consolidation. Two signs of lung consolidation. Left: a massive consolidation (probe at the PLAPS-point) invades the whole left
lower lobe. No aerated lung tissue is present, and no fractal sign can be generated. The deep border is at the mediastinal line (arrows). The
pattern is tissue-like, similar to the spleen (S). The thickness of this image is roughly 10 cm, a value incompatible with a pleural effusion. Image ac￾quired using an ADR-4000 and a sectorial probe (1982 mobile technology) Right: a middle lobe consolidation, which does not invade the whole
lobe. This generates a shredded, fractal boundary between the consolidation and the underlying aerated lung (arrows): the quite specific shred
(or fractal) sign. Such an anterior consolidation generates the C-profile in the BLUE-protocol. Compare with the regular lung line of Figure 3. Note
the blurred letters due to multiple transfers of this image. Quantitative data: a reasonable thickness at the right image is 5.5 cm, giving an index
of 5.5 corresponding to a 165-mL consolidation, roughly. In the left image, the 10-cm depth would correspond to a volume of roughly 1 L.

“false-positives” makes little sense when another sign
is added: the A-line sign (i.e., no B-line seen), with
60% sensitivity but 100% specificity, a logical finding:
interlobular septa come only from visceral pleura [23].
One motionless B-line discounts pneumothorax. Too
superficial linear probes make it difficult to distinguish
B-lines from other comet-tail artifacts (Figure 5).
Abolished lung-sliding plus absence of B-lines, at the
anterior area, in supine patients, is called A’-profile in
the BLUE-protocol (Figure 6). The third step—the
lung point—is pathognomonic [35]. It shows in patients
with an A’-profile, at a precise location, lung signs suddenly
appearing with respiration: transient B-lines, lung-sliding
(Figure 7). It is explained by the inspiratory increase
of parietal contact of the collapsed lung. Complex
pneumothoraces with extensive adherences will not
generate any lung-point. The lung-point indicates that
abolished lung-sliding is not linked to technical flaws,
modern machines, or excessive filters (modern equipments
with time lags may generate issues). The sensitivity is 66%:
fully collapsed lungs cannot reach the wall. Sensitivity for
occult pneumothorax is 79% [37], proving that the
lung-point indicates pneumothorax volume: moderate
if anterior, massive if posterior or even absent. Lateral

(see others in text). Arrows: location of the pleural line. The combination of abolished lung sliding with A-lines, at the anterior chest wall, is the
A’-profile of the BLUE-protocol (as opposed to the A-profile, where lung sliding is present, ruling out pneumothorax). Extract from “Whole body

lung-points correlate with a 90% need for drainage
versus 8% with anterior lung-point [37], as confirmed
[34,38]. Some seconds are required for well-trained
physicians to determine lung-sliding, B-lines, or their
absence—less than 1 minute to detect a lung-point.
The lung-pulse is useful for immediate diagnosis of
an atelectasis (one-lung intubation included) [39]. The
diaphragm is interesting, but we do not devote much
time to careful analysis: locating the thoracoabdominal
frontline and its respiratory movement shows where it is
and how it works [40].
Clinical applications of lung ultrasound in the critically ill
How can lung ultrasound become a daily tool for the
intensivist? By applying fast protocols devoted to acute
respiratory or circulatory failure or cardiac arrest, by
limiting irradiation, mainly.
The approach to acute respiratory failure: the
BLUE-protocol
Acute respiratory failure is a life-threatening condition
whose cause is sometimes difficult to recognize immedi￾ately. Initial mistakes have deleterious consequences
[41]. The extreme patient’s suffering legitimizes the
use of any tool that expedites relief. Reducing the
time needed to provide this relief is the aim of the
BLUE-protocol.
The BLUE-protocol, performed on dyspneic patients
who will be admitted to the ICU, is a fast protocol:
3 minutes are required using suitable machines and
the standardized points of analysis. Novices can take
longer (this time depends on the simplicity and adequacy
of their equipment, of the standardization of their training).
Based on pathophysiology, it provides a step-by-step
diagnosis of the main causes of acute respiratory failure, i.e.,
six diseases seen in 97% of patients in the emergency room,
offering an overall 90.5% accuracy [28,42].
The BLUE-protocol combines signs, associates them
with a location, resulting in seven profiles (Figure 8).
The A-profile associates anterior lung-sliding with A-lines.
The A’-profile is an A-profile with abolished
lung-sliding.
The B-profile associates anterior lung-sliding with
lung-rockets.
The B’-profile is a B-profile with abolished lung-sliding.
The C-profile indicates anterior lung consolidation,
regardless of size and number. A thickened, irregular
pleural line is an equivalent.
The A/B profile is a half A-profile at one lung, a half
B-profile at another.
The PLAPS-profile designates PosteroLateral Alveolar
and/or Pleural Syndrome. PLAPS are sought for after
Figure 7 Pneumothorax and the lung point. A specific sign of pneumothorax. Real-time mode allows detection of the inspiratory increase in
volume of the collapsed lung. When reaching the chest wall where the probe is laid, it makes a sudden change in the ultrasound image, from an
A’-profile to an A- or B-profile usually. The change is sudden because (using an appropriate equipment, without average filters or time lag mainly)
ultrasound is a highly sensitive method, able to detect subtle changes, such as the difference between free gas and alveolar gas. The left image
shows the pleural line just before the visceral pleura appears. The right image shows (arrow) the very moment the visceral pleura has touched
the parietal pleural. This sign has been called lung point (it can be seen along a line, but one point is sufficient for the diagnosis). Video visible at

detection of an A-profile (a pattern compatible with
pulmonary embolism) and of a free venous network
(a pattern making the diagnosis of embolism less likely).
The profile combining A-profile, free veins, and PLAPS is
called A-V-PLAPS-profile.
Each profile is associated with a disease, schematically,
with accuracy indicated in Table 1.
The B-profile suggests acute hemodynamic pulmonary
edema with 97% sensitivity and 95% specificity. The
A-profile associated with DVT provides an 81% sensitivity
and 99% specificity for pulmonary embolism. The B’-profile,
A/B-profile, C-profile, and A-V-PLAPS profile are typical
profiles indicating pneumonia. An A-profile without DVT
or PLAPS (the nude profile) is likely to be severe asthma or
exacerbated COPD. The A’-profile and a lung-point is
specific to pneumothorax.
The BLUE-protocol is initiated just after the physical
examination and followed by echocardiography, cardiac
windows permitting, restricted to a basic, real-time
analysis. Called simple cardiac sonography at CEURF, this
approach is increasingly developing [43].
Space lacks to describe many subtleties. Hemodynamic
pulmonary edema generates transudate, a kind of oil
explaining conserved lung-sliding (B-profile). Pneumonia
generates exudate, a kind of glue, explaining the B’-profile.
This partly explains the potential for distinguishing ARDS
from hemodynamic pulmonary edema. Hemodynamic
edema generates the B-profile in 97% of cases; ARDS
generates a profile of pneumonia in 86% of cases [36].
This is found again in the Italian literature, under the
name of spared areas (A/B-profile), lung consolidations
(C-profile), pleural line modifications (C-profile) [44].
Countless subtleties (such as the C’-profile, a C-profile
with abolished lung sliding) will be included in the
extended BLUE-protocol, a definitive version of the
BLUE-protocol, which must be considered as a prelimin￾ary approach using simplicity. Auscultation data, echocar￾diographic data also will be included.
Regarding rare, double, absent causes, read [42]. False￾positives and false-negatives are of interest, because ultra￾sound provided data that questioned a posteriori the value
of the “gold standard” [36]. Let us remind that, more
than simple CT (which isolated does not have a perfect dis￾criminatory power for a given disease), the “gold standard”
was the final diagnosis of the hospitalization report.
Hemodynamic assessment of circulatory failure using
lung ultrasound: FALLS-protocol
Acute circulatory failure is associated with high mor￾tality. Many tools have been successively used [45].
Echocardiography is one of the most popular [1]. This
presupposes expertise, suitable cardiac windows, or
transesophageal approach. Here, we use a fast protocol
again based on pathophysiology. The heart approach is
limited to the simple cardiac sonography. The lung
approach will compensate for any lack of echocardio￾graphic expertise, considering a direct parameter of
clinical volemia.
Data for using the FALLS-protocol (Fluid Administration
Limited by Lung Sonography) have been published,
showing the correlation between an A-profile or equivalents
(A/B-profile) and a low pulmonary artery occlusion
pressure (PAOP), with a 18-mmHg value occurring
when B-lines appear [46]. Caval vein analysis is
Figure 8 The BLUE-protocol decision tree. This decision tree, slightly modified from the original article (Chest 2008;134:117–125), with the
permission of Chest, indicates a way proposed for immediate diagnosis of the main causes of acute respiratory failure, using a lung and venous
ultrasound approach.

associated to the FALLS-protocol, especially in the
case of initial B-profile.
The FALLS-protocol follows Weil’s classification of
shock. It first searches for substantial pericardial effusion
(likened to pericardial tamponade in acute circulatory
failure), then for right ventricle dilatation (suggesting, in
this context, pulmonary embolism, schematically). If the
cardiac windows are suboptimal, the BLUE-protocol is
used instead. Then, tension pneumothorax is sought for.
If these disorders are absent, obstructive shock can be
discounted, schematically.
Cardiogenic shock from the left heart (i.e., most cases)
is defined by low cardiac output and high PAOP. In the
absence of a B-profile, such cardiogenic shock can be
discounted.
The remaining causes are hypovolemic and distributive
shock. At this step, patients with the A-profile or equiva￾lents, proving dry lungs, are called FALLS-responders.
They are those who can, but mostly must, receive fluids, a
therapy common to both causes. The FALLS-protocol per
se begins: fluid administration.
A hypovolemic mechanism will benefit from fluid
therapy, with corrections of the circulatory failure, and
unchanged A-profile.
If no clinical improvement occurs, fluids eventually
penetrate the lung, which is normally fluid-free. Interstitial
edema always precedes alveolar edema [47] and is
detected by ultrasound at an early step clinically silent,
before gas exchange impairment [48,49]. The change from
A- to B-lines indicates the endpoint for fluid therapy.
Associated with no improvement of circulatory failure,
this indicates, schematically, the only remaining mechanism:
distributive shock, meaning in current practice septic
shock (obvious diagnoses such as anaphylactic shock or
rarities being excluded). This septic shock has just
benefited from one major therapy, following the current
guidelines [50], with two advantages. Early fluid therapy in
sepsis? Far before the diagnosis of septic shock. Massive?
Up to the last admissible drop using pathophysiological
basis. The intensivist can now consider that this fluid
therapy, generating interstitial edema (even silent),
has positioned the heart at the beginning of the flat portion
of the Frank-Starling curve. Minute fluid withdrawal
is achieved, from hemodiafiltration if already present,
reversion of passive leg raising (“FALLS-PLR”-protocol), to
simple blood cultures, specifically useful here, with a view
to positioning the heart at the ideal point of the curve.
If a B-profile is seen on admission, the FALLS-protocol
cannot be used. The diagnosis is usually cardiogenic
shock, but sometimes lung sepsis. The inferior caval
vein roughly correlates with volemia [51,52]. The su￾perior caval vein is accessible to our microconvex

probe. Small dimensions, inspiratory collapse suggest
hypovolemia [53].
Questions are answered in [54]. One cannot pretend
that the FALLS-protocol answers such a complex field;
it is open to any criticism. A validation should raise the
issue of the choice of a pertinent “gold standard.” Physicians
can surround the FALLS-protocol with traditional tools.
The change from A-lines to B-lines, which defines septic
shock in the FALLS-protocol, can be considered as a direct
marker of clinical volemia. Schematically, A-lines indicate
fluid responders, B-lines an endpoint for fluid therapy,
making FALLS-protocol not comparable to approaches
assessing cardiac output. It provides a parameter independ￾ent of usual limitations (transmural pressures, cardiac
arrhythmia, invasive procedures, etc.). One point should be
understood: the caval vein is usually analyzed for predicting
fluid responsiveness: fluid is given, cardiac output moni￾tored. FALLS-protocol does not search for any cardiac
output increase. In the described sequence, the A-profile
indicates that fluid can (and must) be administered. The
B-profile on admission (or appearing during fluid therapy)
indicates that the patient is (or becomes) an equivalent of
not fluid-responder. FALLS-protocol provides a static
parameter, which therefore can be used at the start
(unlike dynamic parameters).
Cardiac arrest: the opportunity for technical
considerations
Ultrasound plays a major role when showing reversible
causes. The SESAME-protocol, a fast protocol devoted to
cardiac arrest, assesses the lung before the heart, because
pneumothorax can be discounted in 2 seconds, with in
addition, windows usually available. This apparently
futile property influences the choice of equipment.
The following section is personal and subjective. A
valuable combination may be our kind of equipment,
coupled with high-level Echo machines used every
time needed, as we repeatedly wrote [55].
Nowadays machines are good. Each probe is good for
its devoted application (vascular, cardiac, abdominal).
We just advocate to have, before the current trend,
defined critical ultrasound using (after the perfectly
suitable ADR-4000) a unit built from 1992 to 2010
which was not inferior, especially in the specific setting
of cardiac arrest, and made every step more simple [6].
This machine that we now use every day is 30-cm wide
on the cart (no matter its height), i.e., narrower than
most machines, laptops with carts included. This
answered to the problem of the economy of room in
busy ICUs, ORs, ERs, where each saved centimeter
makes a difference. It starts in 7 seconds, a critical point
in cardiac arrest (in machines with longer start-up, there
is nothing to do but wait). Its microconvex probe is a
compromise allowing in a few seconds, lungs, heart,
vessels, abdomen assessment exploiting its 17-cm range,
revealing reversible causes (pneumothorax, tamponade,
venous thrombosis, abdominal bleeding…). It is flat,
therefore cleanable, keyboard highlights three basic knobs
useful in extreme emergencies: gain, depth, M-mode. Its
technology does not filter out the artifacts and does not
create time lags. Its low cost was an opportunity for most
patients on Earth. Each detail interacts with the
others, e.g., our single probe lies on our machine top, not
laterally, a detail that saves lateral width. Our main
work was to optimize each step. Our slim machine is
permanently configurated “cardiac arrest,” which works the
same, without necessary change, for routine, daily tasks
(venous line insertion…). Some manufacturers begin to
build machines inspired by this 1992 technology.
Unexpected limitations (dealt with in our textbook,
some apparently futile) can suddenly appear at any step of
the management of extreme emergencies, potentialized by
the extreme stress. An issue is the permanent risk to
face unsuitable cardiac windows. If the user wishes to
follow the SESAME-protocol, i.e., assessing here the
veins (especially calf areas), the cardiac probe should be
urgently replaced by a vascular probe. Time is necessary
at each probe change (heart, abdomen, lungs…), setting
change, not to forget probe/cable disinfection (here
theoretical, usually a critical point). Complex keyboards
turn into hindrances to novices. Several probes make
cables inextricably mixed. Cables lying on the floor
favor the risk of a machine tipover when suddenly
mobilized. Problems occur when each of these small
difficulties is added to each other.
For expediting the mastery of lung ultrasound, we
advise to bypass all filters (a setting one may call “lung”).
Each probe provides fractional data (abdominal probe
for pleural-alveolar characterization, cardiac probe for
posterior analysis in challenging patients, vascular probe
if others cannot show lung-sliding, abdominal again for
assessment of artifacts length, etc.). Most microconvex
probes found in laptop machines do not have the
resolution or range of ours. Machines with lag between
real-time and M-mode can confuse young or stressed
users. Physicians also should check that their cardiac
probes are able to document lung sliding in all conditions
(skinny patients, dyspnea, etc.).
This section was an opportunity to emphasize the interest
of our universal probe among others [56]. We think each
user, even expert, should try similar systems, at least once.
Lung ultrasound: a holistic discipline
A perspective is holistic when the relevance of each of
its multiple element can be understood only if integrated
with the others. Lung ultrasound makes ultrasound a
holistic discipline, as partially seen in the previous
section.

Multifaceted tool
Lung ultrasound can be used without complex adaptation
from the intensivist to anesthesiologists, pediatricians,
neonatal intensivists, emergency physicians, and others
(cardiologists, pulmonologists, nephrologists, etc.), even
out-of-hospital doctors [57]. The lung is a common target
in these disciplines. The signs assessed using CT in adults
are found without difference in critically ill neonates
[58,59]. The unit is easily affordable, generating huge
cost-cutting [39]. These potentials are applicable from
sophisticated ICUs to more basic settings on Earth.
Lung ultrasound complements poor cardiac windows:
B-profile shows pulmonary edema, A-profile hypovolemia,
schematically. Its feasibility is nearly 100%: this vital organ
is superficial and extensive, including bariatric patients,
where the anterior approach provides basic data. Painful
blood gas analyses become less relevant.
Attractive tool
Lung ultrasound is not really ultrasound (i.e., this expert,
operator-dependent tool) for several reasons. Just two
signs are sufficient to define the normality (lung-sliding,
A-lines). This potential allows us to reconsider usual
priorities. Once the physicians operational for life-saving
protocols (BLUE-protocol, FALLS-protocol), they can
quietly learn comprehensive echocardiography during as
long time as necessary.
Solution to the issue of growing irradiation
All intensivists prefer the least invasive tool, all else
being equal. Ultrasound is an answer to the longstanding
dilemma: “Radiography or CT in the ICU?” Radiography
is a familiar tool that lacks sensitivity [60]: 60-70%, all
fields considered [61-63]. CT has a high accuracy but
severe drawbacks: cost (a real problem for most patients
on Earth), transportation of critically ill patients, delay
between CT and the resulting therapy, renal issues,
anaphylactic shock, mainly high irradiation [64,65].
Ultrasound has quite similar performances to CT
[12,17,20,30,37], being on occasion superior: better
detection of pleural septations, necrotic areas [66],
real-time measurement allowing assessment of dynamic
signs: lung-sliding, air bronchogram [67], diaphragm
[68,69]. Ultrasound should be considered as reasonable,
bedside “gold standard.” For all assessed disorders, it
provides quantitative data (Figures 3, 4, and 7). Pleural
effusions can be quantified [14,70-72]. Lung consolidation
can be monitored, which is useful for those who want to
increase end-expiratory pressure [73]. The volume and
progression of a pneumothorax are monitored using the
lung-point location [34,37,38]. Lung ultrasound will favor
programs allowing decrease in bedside radiographs and
CTs in the next decades.
Limitations
Dressings and subcutaneous emphysema make unsuperable
limitations. Exceptional cases provide difficult interpretation,
even for experts. Is lung ultrasound easy? Some experiences
show high interobserver agreement [13]. A burgeoning
literature, up to a consensus conference [74-88], seems
to confirm this accessibility. A scientific assessment of
the learning curve remains to be done, not in volunteers
(creating a selection bias), but in unselected physicians.
Care should be taken to confide training to experts
choosing simplicity, although one can practice lung
ultrasound with any machine, any probe, any teaching
approach. Our work was mainly to provide standardized
signs, a major advantage of lung ultrasound, because the
risk of wrong interpretations is highly decreased.
Review, conclusions
Lung ultrasound allows fast, accurate, bedside examina￾tions of most acute respiratory disorders. It enables a
pathophysiological approach to circulatory failure. Simpli￾city is providentially found at this vital organ. The versatil￾ity of lung ultrasound heralds a kind of visual medicine, a
priority in intensive care as well as many other disciplines
and settings [89].
