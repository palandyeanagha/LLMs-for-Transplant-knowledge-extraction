Abstract
miRNA regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional level and fine-tune the key biological processes, including cancer
progression. Here, we demonstrate the involvement of miR-200b in the metastatic spread of prostate cancer. We identified
miR-200b as a downstream target of androgen receptor and linked its expression to decreased tumorigenicity and
metastatic capacity of the prostate cancer cells. Overexpression of miR-200b in PC-3 cells significantly inhibited their
proliferation and the formation of subcutaneous tumors. Moreover, in an orthotopic model, miR-200b blocked spontaneous
metastasis and angiogenesis by PC-3 cells. This decreased metastatic potential was likely due to the reversal of the
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, as was evidenced by increased pan-epithelial marker E-cadherin and specific markers
of prostate epithelium, cytokeratins 8 and 18. In contrast, mesenchymal markers, fibronectin and vimentin, were
significantly downregulated by miR-200b. Our results suggest an important role for miR-200b in prostate cancer progression
and indicate its potential utility for prostate cancer therapy.

Introduction
MicroRNA (miRNA) are short, (21–22 nucleotides) non-coding
RNA that bind to mRNA and repress gene expression by mRNA
degradation/destabilization or through impaired translation [1].
MicroRNA are first transcribed as 100 bp primary miRNA
hairpin structures, which are subsequently cleaved by Drosha into
pre-miRNA and exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm for
further processing [2,3]. Cleavage of pre-miRNA by Dicer
proteins yields 22 bp double-stranded molecules, of which one
strand is selectively loaded onto the Argonaute proteins, which
facilitate miRNA binding to the 39UTR target sequences on
mRNA. MiRNA play pivotal roles in multiple developmental and
pathological processes, including cancer of the breast, skin, lung,
and cervix [4–9].
The miRNA hsa-miR-200b belongs to a family that includes
miR-200a, miR-200c, miR-141, and miR-429. Dysregulation of
mir-200b has been ascribed a critical role in the epithelial to
mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis in cancers such as
breast, gastric, and pancreatic carcinomas [10–12]. Human miR￾200b participates in a double feedback loop with the two
transcriptional regulators of E-Cadherin, ZEB1 and ZEB2 [13].
In normal epithelial cells, miR-200b is expressed at high levels; by
targeting the 39UTR regions of pro-metastatic transcriptional
factors ZEB1 and ZEB2 it blocks the expression and halts EMT
[10]. In contrast, in mesenchymal cells, where ZEB1/ZEB2
expression is abnormally high, they suppress the miRNA of miR￾200 family by blocking their promoter activity [13]. Multiple
studies assess miR-200b function in EMT, although there are few
attempts to address its role in the primary tumor growth.
Here, we demonstrate that miR-200b possesses a similar activity
in prostate cancer. Seeking to identify miRNA that contribute to
decreased aggressiveness and tumorigenesis in prostate cancer, we
performed miRNA profiling of cell lines with inducible expression
of androgen receptor previously developed in our lab. We found
that miR-200b was significantly upregulated in the poorly
tumorigenic PC3 AR-positive cells and that overexpression of
miR-200b led to decreased tumor growth. This decreased
tumorigenesis was likely due to decreased proliferation. On the
other hand, miR-200b strongly upregulated the epithelial cell
marker E-cadherin in PCa cells, while the mesenchymal markers
Fibronectin and Vimentin were concomitantly decreased. In
agreement with the analyses performed in other tumor types,
ZEB1, a transcriptional regulator of E-Cadherin was also
decreased upon miR-200b overexpression. In addition, miR￾200b reduced the invasive potential of the PCa cells in vitro and
decreased metastasis. Our results show that miR-200b decreases
tumor growth and reverses EMT in prostate cancer.

Cell Lines and Treatment Conditions
PC3 cells transfected with inducible wild-type androgen
receptor (AR) or control plasmid were established previously
[14]. Cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with
10% Tetracycline-free Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 2% penicillin/
streptomycin, 50 mg/ml Zeocin and 1 mg/ml Blasticidin. For AR
expression, PC3-AR cells were treated for 5 days with 1 mg/ml of
Doxycycline and 1 nM of methyltrienolone (R1881) in phenol red
free RPMI media supplemented with 10% Charcoal-Stripped
FBS, 2% penicillin/streptomycin, 50 mg/ml Zeocin and 1 mg/ml
Blasticidin. The parental PC3 cells were maintained in RPMI with
10% FBS and 2% penicillin/streptomycin. All cells were grown at
37uC and 5% CO2, in a humidified incubator.
Immunoblotting
Cells were plated at a density of 100,000 cells per 10 cm dish.
The cells were collected by scraping in phosphate buffered saline
(PBS) and centrifuged at 2,500 RPM for 10 minutes at 4uC. The
cell pellet was lysed in Ripa buffer (Sigma, St. Louis, MO)
supplemented with 1X protease/phosphatase inhibitor solution
(Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) and centrifuged at 12,000
RPM for 20 minutes at 4uC. The concentration of the supernatant
was determined in triplicate by protein assay (DC Protein Assay,
Biorad, Hercules, CA). The lysates were electrophoresed on 4%–
20% Tris HCL polyacrylamide gels (Biorad, Hercules, CA).
Protein lysate was transferred overnight onto PVDF membranes
(GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburg, PA). Each membrane was
rinsed in 1X Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T),
blocked with 5% non-fat milk in TBS-T and probed with
antibodies as indicated in Table S3.
RNA Extraction
For miRNA detection, total RNA was isolated with miRNeasy
Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). For mRNA extraction, tumors
were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and transferred into RNA
stabilization solution (Ambion, Life Technologies, Grand Island,
NY). The tumors were maintained at 280uC and RNA extraction
was performed using miRNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).
The RNA concentration and purity was measured with NanoVue
Plus spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburg,
PA).
Real Time RT-PCR
RNA was reverse transcribed with miScript II RT Kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The
resulting cDNA was used for real-time PCR analysis using
miScript SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). For
individual miRNA quantification we used miScript Primer Assays
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA). For polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
analysis, forward and reverse primers were designed and
purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA)
and reactions performed using SYBR Green super mix (Quanta
Biosciences, Gaithersburg, MD). The reactions were performed in
a Thermal iCycler (Biorad, Hercules, CA). Each sample was tested
in triplicate.
miRNA Array Analysis
PC3-AR cells were treated with Doxycycline (Dox) and R1881
(as described above) for expression and activation of Androgen
Receptor (AR), respectively. RNA was extracted as described
above and 5 mg of each sample was sent to LC Sciences (Houston,
TX) for array analysis. Samples were labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 and
the intensity ratio of each was used to determine the changes in
miRNA expression level. A 20-nucleotide RNA control sequence
complementary to multiple control probes spotted on each chip
was included in each sample as an internal control. The
microarrays were performed in triplicate for human, mouse and
rat sequences. The potential target spectrum for select miRNA was
defined using Sanger miRBase 11.0. Statistical significance was
determined using Student’s T-test for p,0.10, p,0.05 and
p,0.01.
miR-200b Overexpression
Shuttle vector encoding precursor sequence hsa-miR-200b
(pMIRNA1 pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-copRFP) and control vector
(pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-copRFP) from System Biosciences (SBI,
Mountain View, CA) were propagated in Luria Broth +50 mg/ml
ampicillin overnight at 30uC in an orbital shaker. Endotoxin-free
plasmid DNA was isolated using Endo-Free Maxi Prep kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Lentiviral particles were produced for
each plasmid in HEK293T cells using the pMD2.G envelope and
psPAX2 2nd generation packaging plasmids (AddGene, Cam￾bridge, MA). The titer was determined by flow cytometry of
infected cells as described previously [15]. For transfection, PC3
cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 105 cells/well. The following
day, the media was replaced with 1 ml of 1X DMEM containing

the appropriate MOI of lentiviral particles for miR-200b and
empty vector control. After 6 hr incubation, the cells were fed with
RPMI with 10% FBS and 2% penicillin/streptomycin and
incubated for an additional 48 hrs. Transduced cells expressing
high levels of RFP marker were isolated and flow cytometry
combined with cell sorting and maintained in RPMI with 10%
FBS, penicillin/streptomycin and 1 mg/ml Puromycin for addi￾tional selection.
Tumorigenesis Assays
(1) Subcutaneous inoculation. Parental PC3 cells, PC3 cells
transduced with control lentivirus and miR-200b cells were grown
as described above, harvested and resuspended at 26107 cells/ml
in serum-free RPMI. One hundred mL of cell suspension (26106
cells/mouse) were injected subcutaneously into the rear hindquar￾ters of athymic male mice (Nu/Nu, n = 5). The tumors were
measured with microcalipers three times a week and the
experiment was terminated at 29 days post implantation. The
tumors were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 280uC
for subsequent analysis.
(2) Orthotopic implantation of tumor cells was performed
as described previously [16]. Briefly, midline incisions were
made, superior to the genital area of supine anesthetized male
athymic mice (nu/nu). The bladder was externalized and extended
with a cotton swab to reveal the seminal vesicles and the dorsum of
the prostate. Tumor cells in 50 ml of serum-free RPMI (106 per
animal) were injected into the prostate and the muscle and skin
were closed with sutures and metal clips, respectively. All
procedures were performed in sterile environment. Metal clips
were removed 2 weeks post-injection. Tumor growth was
monitored by GFP fluorescence, using small animal imaging
system OV100 (Olympus). The experiment was terminated
20 days post implantation. The tumors were excised and snap￾frozen for subsequent analysis. To assess metastasis, the residual
fluorescence was measured after removal of the primary tumor.
Proliferation Assay
The cells were seeded in triplicate in 96 well plates at 36103
cells/well. After 24, 48, and 72 hours, 10 ml of WST-1 reagent
(Roche, Indianapolis, IN) was added to each well and incubated
for 2 hours. The absorbance was measured for each time point at
450 nm wave length using the Biorad microplate reader (Biorad,
Hercules, CA).
In Vitro Invasion Assay
Transwell inserts (Corning, Tewksbury, MA) were coated with
100 ml of 1 mg/ml of Phenol Red free Growth Factor Reduced
Matrigel (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and allowed to
solidify at 37uC in a tissue culture incubator for 24 hours. The cells
were resuspended at a density of 106 cells/200 ml in serum-free
RPMI, seeded in duplicates in the top part of the coated inserts
and incubated at 37uC for 24 hours, with 700 ml of 10% FBS
added to the lower chamber as a chemoattractant. The cells were
fixed and stained using DiffQuick Fixative solutions (Dade
Behring, Malvern, PA) and 6 fields were imaged for each
experimental condition. The invasion was calculated as percent
invaded cells. The experiment was performed twice.
Cell Cycle Analysis
The cells were seeded at 106 cells/ml in RPMI supplemented
with 0.2% FBS. After 48 hrs the cells were trypsinized, washed
twice in cold PBS, fixed in 10 ml 75% ice-cold ethanol and kept
overnight at 220uC. The cells were washed twice in 1X PBS at
4uC, resuspended in 2.0 ml DAPI staining solution (0.1% TritonX
100 in 10 ml PBS, 100 ml of 1 mg/ml DAPI) and analyzed by
FACS.
Statistical Analysis
All quantitative data were generated from at least two
independent experiments pooled together, with each individual
data point performed in triplicates. Standard Deviation (SD) were
calculated using Microsoft Excel software. To determine statistical
significance of the observed difffrences, we have performed
pairwise comparison of the datasets, using one-tailed Student’s
T-test. Statistical significance was set at P value not exceeding
0.05.

cancer cell line, PC-3 [14]. MicroRNA are important modifiers of
biological functions, including tumor growth. We sought the
miRNA that are controlled by AR and involved in the negative
regulation of prostate cancer progression. For this purpose, we
performed miRNA profiling of the previously generated cell line
with tetracycline-inducible AR expression ([14], Fig. 1a). The cells
were treated with Doxycycline (Dox) to ensure AR expression and
with R1881, to induce AR nuclear translocation and transcrip￾tional activity.
Microarray analysis revealed statistically significant differential
expression of 837 individual miRNA in response to AR activation
(p,0.05 as determined by Students’ T-test), of which 116 were
showed P-values below 0.01 (Figure 1b, Tables S1 and S2). We
selected miRNA that were changed more than 2-fold and analyzed
their potential targets and functions using Sanger miRBase version
11.0 and Diana Micro T version 3.0. Eight miRNA were selected
based on their potential involvement in cancer progression as was
determined by in silico analysis and published studies. Five of the
selected miRNA upregulated in the less tumorigenic PC3-AR cells
were also associated with decreased tumorigenesis in other cancers
(Table 1). MicroRNA from the miR-200 cluster (miR-200a, miR￾200b) have been shown to act as tumor suppressors in gastric,
cervical, lung, breast and prostate cancers [9,10,17,18]. Increased
miR-200c levels have been linked to decreased metastasis in
melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and prostate cancer
[6,18,19]. miR-30a and miR 30-d expression is significantly
decreased in chronic myeloid leukemia, non-small cell lung cancer,
renal cell carcinoma, and prostate cancer [20–23]. In contrast,
miR-7 and miR-9 levels were decreased in the less tumorigenic cell
line. In accord, miR-7 has been identified as an oncogene in renal
cell carcinoma [24] and miR-9 ascribed a role in leukemogenesis
[25–27]. Low miR-196a levels were observed in malignant
melanoma [28] (Table 2).
We have validated select microRNA identified by array analysis
using real-time PCR. Indeed, miR-200b, 30a, and 30d were
increased, and miR-9 decreased, and these changes were
statistically significant (p#0.05) (Figure 2a). We selected miR￾200b for further analysis since it showed the highest fold change
and because of its known role in EMT and metastasis [10,13].
We measured miR-200b levels in PC3-AR cells treated with the
combination of Doxycycline, a synthetic androgen R1881 and the
anti-androgen flutamide, a competitive inhibitor of AR function.
MiR-200b was significantly increased in response to R1881 and
this increase was abolished by flutamide in a dose dependent
manner, suggesting a direct transcriptional regulation by AR
(Figure 2b).
miR-200b Suppresses the Growth of Prostate Cancer
Xenografts
We next sought the effect of miR-200b expression on prostate
cancer tumorigenesis. We overexpressed miR-200b in PC3 cells by
transduction with high-titer lentivirus, using empty vector (pCDH￾CMV-MCS-EF1-copRFP) as a negative control, and confirmed
miR-200b expression by real-time RT-PCR (Figure 3a). The
resultant cell lines and parental PC3 cells were subcutaneously
injected into male athymic nude mice. Importantly, tumors
formed by the cells expressing miR-200b were significantly smaller
then the tumors formed by the parental PC3 and the cells
transduced with control vector (Figure 3b). Importantly, miR-200b
expression was maintained for the duration of the experiment, as
was verified by real-time RT-PCR (Figure 3c). Because tumor
interactions with its microenvironment play a critical role in tumor
progression, we performed orthotopic implantation of the PC3-
200b and control cell lines as previously described [16] into the
dorsal prostate of male athymic mice. We took advantage of the
RFP marker incorporated in the bicistronic lentiviral vector to
perform longitudinal in vivo imaging. The overall fluorescence pre￾dissection was significantly lower in mice bearing PC3 miR-200b
positive tumors compared to the vector control group (Figure 3d,
e). Thus miR-200b expression was sufficient to reduce tumor
growth. Moreover, imaging of abdomen after tumor removal
revealed significantly lesser fluorescence due to secondary lesions,
suggesting that miR-200b decreased both the primary growth and
metastasis by the PC-3 PCa cells (see below).
miR-200b Suppresses Proliferation of the PCa Cells
Seeking factors that contribute to the decreased tumor growth,
we performed cell cycle analysis of PC3 control and PC3 miR￾200b cells and observed a mild increase in G2/M phase om miR￾200b positive cells suggesting cell cycle arrest (Figure S1). Indeed,
WST-1 assay for viable cells revealed a slight but significant
reduction in cell numbers in the miR-200b positive cells as
compared to vector control (Figure 3g, h). Combined with
significant decrease in Ki-67 positive nuclei in the PC-3 tumors
upon miR-200b expression (Figure 3f), our results suggests that the
observed decreased in tumor growth was caused by decreased
proliferation.
miR-200b Reverses Epithelial to Mesencymal Transition in
PCa Cells
In previous studies, miR-200b expression in breast, gastric, and
renal cell carcinoma correlates with the more differentiated state, and
re-introduction of miR-200b reverses EMT [10,11,29]. These
changes can ultimately contribute both to decreased tumor growth
and metastasis. Therefore, we analyzed the levels of known EMT and
differentiation markers expressed by the PC-3 cells in the presence or
absence of miR-200b. First, Western blot analysis showed a
significant increase in the typical differentiation markers of prostate
epithelium Cytokeratin CK8 and CK18 by miR-200b, suggesting a
more differentiated state of miR-200b positive cells (Figure 4).
In agreement, the levels of E-cadherin were also increased
(Figure 5a), suggesting a shift towards epithelial phenotype.
Furthermore, Vimentin, a mesenchymal marker, underwent a
statistically significant decrease upon miR-200b expression.
Another mesenchymal marker, fibronectin (FN) displayed a similar
trend although the decrease did not reach statistical significance
(Figure 5b). Because in previous studies miR-200b controlled
E-Cadherin and EMT by repression of the transcriptional factor
ZEB1, we have assessed both total ZEB1 protein and RNA levels
in miR-200b-positive and control PC-3 cells. We observed a

significant and reproducible decrease in ZEB1 protein and mRNA
in response to miR-200b (Figure 5c, d). This result is consistent
with the increased E-cadherin expression (Figure 5a). Our results
clearly demonstrate that miR-200b expression promotes the
epithelial cell characteristics and suppresses mesenchymal features
in PC3 cells.

miR-200b Decreases Invasion and Metastasis by PC-3
Cells
Because miR-200b caused EMT reversal in PCa PC-3 cells, it
was reasonable to expect a decreased invasive potential as well.
Using a standard procedure to measure cell invasion, we observed
a significant decrease in the percentage of invaded cells due to
miR-200b expression as compared to control (Figure 5e). This
decreased invasion likely underlies the decreased regional metas￾tasis by PC3 miR-200b cells in vivo.
Orthotopic injection of parental PC-3 and vector control cells
into the dorsal prostates of athymic male mice resulted in
spontaneous metastasis, as was detected after the removal of the
primary tumors (Fig. 5f and Figure S2). The overall fluorescence
due to metastasis was dramatically decreased in mice implanted
with the PC-3 cells overexpressing miR-200b (Figure 5f, g and
Figure S2). Thus our data suggest that miR-200b significantly
decreases mesenchymal features in prostate cancer cells and thus
reduces their invasive characteristics and metastatic potential.
miR-200b Reduces Tumor Angiogenesis
Another feature that may enable metastasis is angiogenesis and
EMT is often accompanied by increased angiogenesis. The
expression of miR-200b appeared to reverse angiogenic switch
in PC-3 cells as was evidenced by decreased microvascular density
in the miR-200b positive tumors compared to the parental PC-3
or vector control tumors (Fig. 6).
Discussion
The miR-200 family is a tumor-suppressive family of micro￾RNA that play critical roles in suppression of EMT. While the role
of miR-200 family in breast and some other epithelial cancers is
well established, there are few findings linking miR-200 with
prostate cancer. A small-scale study (20 patients) suggests an
association between the biochemical relapse after radical prosta￾tectomy and the lower levels of miR-200c [30]. One study by He
et al. demonstrates that low levels of miR-200b-3p in androgen￾independent cells are caused by decreased expression of the p-53-
related protein p73 and contribute to increased proliferation [31].
The two clusters encoding miR-200 family are found on
chromosomes 1 and 12, with miR-200b, miR-200a, and miR￾429 on chromosome 1 and miR-200c and miR-141 on chromo￾some 12. MicroRNA 200c is thought to be epithelial-specific and
its expression is repressed by hypermethylation of the proximal
CpG island in the fibroblasts and in breast cancer cell lines [32]. In
the PC-3, but not in LnCaP and DU145 PCa cells, similar
hypermethylation of the CpG island coincides with the low levels
of miR-200c and miR-141 [32]. Consistent with our results, in this
study the PC3 cells negative for miR-200c and miR-141, display a
clear mesenchymal phenotype and the capacity for invasion and
metastasis [32]. Two studies indicate the role for miR-200 in
tumorigenesis by the PCa stem cells. In stem-like PCa cells the
expression of Sox2, Nanog, Oct4, Lin28B and/or Notch1 is
consistent with enhanced clonogenic survival and the ability to form
spheroids (prostaspheres). These stem-like features are connected to
decreased expression of miR-200b/c and/or of let-7 family whereby
re-expression of miR-200 inhibits prostasphere formation and
reduces Notch1 and Lin28B, the drivers of self-renewal [33]. In an
unrelated study, the invasive tumorigenic clones derived from the
benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)-1 cell line chronically exposed to
TGF-b display prominent EMT features with high levels of SNAI2,
ZEB1, and ZEB2, all confirmed miR-200 targets; however, the
basal miR-200 levels in these cells remain unaltered suggesting a
divergent mechanism [34].
The augmented stem-like features suggest enhanced tumorige￾nicity. Indeed, multiple groups have shown that miR-200b alters
the growth rate of experimental tumors by the cultured PCa cells
[35]. Our data clearly corroborate these observations. MiR-200b
expression dramatically reduced the size of both subcutaneous and
orthotopic tumors formed by the PC-3 cells. In contrast with
previous observations in breast cancer cells and preclinical models
of breast cancer, which showed dramatic reduction of proliferative
capacity by miR-200 family members [36], we found that miR￾200 only modestly decelerated the growth of PC-3 cells in vitro and
in vivo. It is possible that miR-200b alone is insufficient to inhibit
proliferation: microRNA are generally changed in concert and
multiple miRNA target a single trait. The miR-200 family has
often been studied in tandem, and our array analysis also revealed
lesser but significant increases in miR-200c and miR-429, which
could further enhance anti-proliferative effect of miR-200b.
Our study for the first time identified miR-200b as direct target
of androgen receptor: in AR-expressing PC-3 cells miR-200 levels
were increased by DHT and the anti-androgen Flutamide fully
abolished this increase. In PCa, hyperactivation or amplification of
AR signaling often increases proliferation and contribute to
tumorigenesis [37]. However, in some contexts, including PC-3
cells, AR opposes PCa progression [14,38–40]. This tumor
suppressive activity is consistent with AR role as the driver of
differentiation in prostate epithelium [41]. Our results suggest that
the AR may contribute to the maintenance of miR-200 family
members in the normal poorly tumorigenic transformed prostate
epithelium and that this pathway is disrupted in the aggressive,
metastatic PCa. In our previous studies AR expression in PC3 cells
led to G1 cell cycle arrest and senescence. Despite its effect on cell
proliferation, miR-200b failed to cause growth arrest or senes￾cence in vitro and in vivo (data not shown) suggesting that AR￾induced senescence occurs independently of miR-200b. Interest￾ingly, in the study by He et al., decreased miR-200b occurred in
the cells with perturbed AR signaling (PC-3 and androgen￾independent sub-clone of LNCaP; however, this study established

a causative link between miR-200b expression and p73 (see above)
but not AR [31].
The role of the miR-200 family in the suppression of
mesenchymal characteristics and metastasis is firmly established
in kidney, gastric, and breast cancers [11]. Similarly, the loss of
miR-200 is associated with EMT of the PCa. In murine
adenocarcinoma of the prostate there is a direct self-reinforcing
regulatory loop where miR-1 and miR-200 are decreased in the
course of progression causing de-repression of Slug (SNAI2),
which in turn blocks miR-1 and miR-200 transcription and
amplifies EMT [42]. In addition, the exposure to exogenous
PDGF-B as well as its stable overexpression dramatically augments
the EMT features in cultured PC-3 PCa cells. In this case, the
enhanced mesenchymal features are associated with a decrease of
miR-200b and re-introduction of miR-200b significantly inhibits
the migration and invasion due to PDGF-B [35]. In agreement
with these findings, miR-200b increased epithelial features of the
PC-3 cells and reduced some of the mesenchymal markers, such as
vimentin and fibronectin. The expression levels of CK8 and
CK18, the markers of AR-positive, fully differentiated prostatic
epithelium [43,44], were much higher in the presence of miR￾200b.
In agreement, we found the partial reversal of the EMT
signature upon miR-200b expression, with increased E-cadherin
and decreased Fibronectin, Vimentin, and ZEB1. These changes
could be more dramatic if multiple miR-200 family members were
activated, however even a single member, miR-200b, caused a
dramatic reduction in the invasive potential of the PC-3 cells and a
striking decrease in spontaneous regional metastasis in an
orthotopic model. We were unable to demonstrate the change in
SNAI2, which may reflect the difference in the target spectrum
between the murine and human cells.
The effect of miR-200 family on angiogenesis has been
established only recently. One study implicates miR-200c in the
regulation of angiogenesis in the endometrial tissue, by suppressing
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its VEGF receptor
2 (FLT1) [45]. Another very recent analysis elucidates the link
between increased angiogenesis in the breast, ovarian and renal
cancers and the loss of miR-200a and b, whereby miR-200a/b
collectively block the expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and
CXCL1, a small cytokine previously called GRO1 [46]. The
IL-8 contributes the angiogenesis proper (the sprouting of pre￾existing capillaries), while CXCL1 supports the recruitment of the
bone marrow-derived progenitor cells to the tumor neovascula￾ture. In agreement we observe a marked decrease in angiogenesis
in prostate cancer xenografts upon miR-200b overexpression. This
decreased angiogenesis is likely to further attenuate metastatic
burden in a model where PC-3 cells metastasize spontaneously
from an orthotopic site.
In conclusion, we identified miR-200b as a factor in decreased
tumor growth when expressed in PC3 cells. We also found
evidence that miR-200b could reverse or hinder EMT as
described in other cell lines and for the first time demonstrated
the anti-metastatic activity of miR-200 in an orthotopic preclinical
model of PCa that recapitulates PCa progression in an appropriate
microenvironment, which includes microvasculature. The inclu￾sion of other members of the miR-200 family may shed further
light on their role in PCa proliferation and survival and provide
compelling rationale for miR-200 based treatment for the
metastatic PCa.
