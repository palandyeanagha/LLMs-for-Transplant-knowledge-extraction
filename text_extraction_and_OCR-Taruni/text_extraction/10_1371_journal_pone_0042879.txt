Abstract
Purpose: The effectiveness of immunotherapy for postoperative hepatocellular carcinoma patients is still controversial. To
address this issue, we did a systemic review of the literatures and analyzed the data with emphasis on the recurrence and
survival.
Methods: We searched six randomized controlled trials that included adoptive immunotherapy in the postoperative
management of hepatocellular carcinoma and compared with non-immunotherapy postoperation. A meta-analysis was
carried out to examine one- and 3-year recurrence and survival.
Results: The overall analysis revealed significantly reduced risk of 1-year recurrence in patients receiving adoptive
immunotherapy (OR = 0.35; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.71; p = 0.003), in that the risk of 3-year recurrence with a pooled OR estimated
at 0.31 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.61; p = 0.001). However, no statistically significant difference was observed for 3-year survival
between groups with adoptive immunotherapy and without adjuvant treatment (OR = 0.91; 95% CI, 0.45 to 1.84; P = 0.792).
Conclusions: Adjuvant immunotherapy with cytokine induced killer cells or lymphokine activated killer cells may reduce
recurrence in postoperative hepatocellular carcinoma patients, but may not improve survival.

Introduction
Each stage of cancer development is regulated uniquely by the
immune system; whereas full activation of adaptive immune cells
at the tumor stage may result in eradication of malignant cells,
chronic activation of innate immune cells at sites of premalignant
growth may actually enhance tumor development [1]. Higher
incidences of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have been reported
in chronic liver disease related to viral hepatitis B and C. And
HCC patients often have functional deficiency in host adaptive
and innate immune responses against the cancer [2]. Immuno￾therapy is a promising treatment option for HCC by stimulating
the immune system to recognize and kill the tumor cells [3].
Immunotherapy mainly includes lymphokine-activated killer
(LAK) cells and cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells, and has
evolved from experimental procedures into early clinical studies
with encouraging preliminary efficacy towards susceptible autol￾ogous and allogeneic tumor cells in both therapeutic and adjuvant
settings. First described in the early 1980s, LAK cells are cytotoxic
effector lymphocytes whose cytolytic activities are not restricted by
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and have the ability to
kill tumor cells and NK-resistant tumor cell lines [4]. CIK cells are
generated by polyclonal T effector cells when cultured under
cytokine stimulation. CIK cells exhibit potent, non-MHC-restrict￾ed cytolytic activities against susceptible tumor cells of both
autologous and allogeneic origins [5].
However, the value of immunotherapy for postoperative HCC
patients remains controversial, especially in preventing recurrence
and prolonging survival [6]. Takayama et al. reported that
immunotherapy can lower recurrence and improve recurrence￾free outcomes after surgery for HCC [7]. But Kawata et al.
reported no statistically significant difference in the survival rate or
in the cumulative disease free rate [8]. The current study is a meta￾analysis of published randomized controlled trials to investigate
the efficacy of adoptive immunotherapy in postoperative hepato￾cellular carcinoma.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
To be included in the meta-analysis, studies must be random￾ized controlled trials that compared adoptive immunotherapy with

no adjuvant treatment in HCC patients who had undergone
curative resection.
Relevant studies were identified by searching PubMed (1976
onward), Embase (1966 onward), the Cochrane Center Register of
Controlled Trials (no date restriction), Biological Abstracts (no
date restriction), Science Citation Index (no date restriction),
China National Knowledge Infrastructure (no date restriction),
and the Chinese BioMedical Literature Database (no date
restriction). Keywords used included ‘‘liver neoplasms’’, ‘‘liver
cancer’’, ‘‘hepatocellular carcinoma’’, ‘‘resectable’’, ‘‘operation’’,
‘‘operative’’, ‘‘resection’’, ‘‘hepatectomy’’, ‘‘postoperative’’, ‘‘post￾operation’’, ‘‘immunotherapy’’, ‘‘cytokine induced killer cells’’,
‘‘tumor infiltrating lymphocytes’’, ‘‘lymphokine activated killer
cells’’ and ‘‘interleukin-2’’. We also manually searched the
American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Scientific
Meeting proceedings from 2004 to 2011. In addition, reference
lists of the trials selected before and relevant reviews were
examined for other eligible trials. We also searched http://www.
ClinicalTrials.gov website for the information of prospective and
ongoing trials. No language restriction was applied.
Data extraction and quality assessment
Data extraction was independently conducted by two reviewers
(Feng Xie and Xinji Zhang) using a standardized approach.
Disagreement was adjudicated by a third reviewer (Hui Li) after
referring back to the original publications. The following
information was obtained from each source article: year of
publication, number of patients, sex, cirrhosis rate, alpha￾fetoprotein levels, Child–Pugh class, operative method, immuno￾therapy regimen, number of patients assessable for 1- and 3- year
recurrence, and number of patients assessable for 3-year overall
survival.
The modified 10-point Jadad scale [9,10] was used to assess the
quality of the trials based on the reporting of the study methods
and results, namely allocation sequence generation, allocation
concealment, double blinding, description of protocol deviations,
withdrawals, and dropouts, and efficacy of randomization.
Statistical analysis
The analysis was carried out by pair-wise comparison of the
immunotherapy-containing arms of the identified trials with the
respective non-immunotherapy arms. One study [15] included in
the meta-analysis had a four-arm design: it compared two
regimens at two different approaches; therefore, each immuno￾therapy arm was paired to its natural counterpart defined by the
matching treatment approaches.
Treatment effects are reflected by odds ratios (ORs) for
recurrence and 1-year survival. To calculate the pooled odds
ratio (OR), the number of recurrence or survival in each arm were
extracted from each study and combined using a method reported
by Mantel and Haenszel [11]. A pooled OR,1 indicated lower
recurrence or lower survival in the immunotherapy arm. To
evaluate whether the results of the studies were homogeneous, we
used the Cochran’s Q test (considered significant for P,0.10) [12].
It is a chi-squares test with df equal to the number of studies minus
one, and tests the null hypothesis that the difference between the
study estimates of OR is due to chance. We also calculated the
quantity I2 [13,14] that describes the percentage of variation
across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance. I2
values of 25%, 50%, and 75% were used as evidence of low,
moderate, and high heterogeneity, respectively. The OR was
calculated with a fixed-effect model when no statistically significant
heterogeneity existed; otherwise, a random-effect model was
employed. All the reported p values were two-sided. P values at
,0.05 were regarded as statistically significant. Statistic analyses
were carried out using STATA 11.0.
Results
We identified 6 randomized controlled trials [7–8,15–18]
including 494 patients using the strategy summarized in Figure 1.
Of these 6 trials, 4 trials were conducted in mainland China; the
remaining two were conducted in Japan. All used resection as
basic treatment before adoptive immunotherapy. Two trials used
CIK as adoptive immunotherapy, one used CIK plus interleukin-2
(IL-2), and the remaining three used LAK plus IL-2. The
characteristics of each study are listed in Table 1.
The Jadad score was 6 for one trial, 5 for two trials , 3 in two
trials, and 2 in the remaining one trial.
1-year recurrence
Information on 1-year recurrence was available in 2 trials
[15,16] contained 163 patients (85 patients received immunother￾apy). In each protocol, HCC recurred in 19 (22.3%) adoptive
immunotherapy patients compared with 34 (43.6%) controls
within 1 year. Only one of the trials showed lower recurrence for
adoptive immunotherapy patients while the others did not found
difference between the two groups. The estimated pooled OR for
both 2 trials shows a highly significant reduction of the risk of
recurrence for patients receiving adoptive immunotherapy
(OR = 0.35; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.71; p = 0.003; Fig. 2). The
Cochran’s Q test had a p value of 0.342 and the corresponding
quantity I2 was 6.7%, indicating that the degree of variability
between trials was consistent with what would be expected to
occur by chance alone.
3-year recurrence
Information on 3-year recurrence was available for 2 trials (163
patients) [15,16]. Among the 94 recurrence cases, HCC recurred
in 38 (44.7%) adoptive immunotherapy patients compared with 56
(71.8%) controls within 3 year. Again, the meta-analysis demon￾strated a significant reduction in the risk of 3-year recurrence in
the group undergoing adoptive immunotherapy with a pooled OR
estimated at 0.31 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.61; p = 0.001; figure 3). There
was no evidence of heterogeneity among individual studies
(p = 0.648; I2= 0%).
Survival
Information on 3-year overall survival was available for 2 trials
[8,18] including 151 patients. No statistically significant difference
was observed between adoptive immunotherapy and no adjuvant
treatment for 3-year survival (OR = 0.91; 95% CI, 0.45 to 1.84;
P = 0.792; Figure 4). There was no evidence of heterogeneity
among individual studies (p = 0.708; I2= 0%).
Discussion
Our analysis confirms that adoptive immunotherapy is a safe,
feasible treatment that can decrease recurrence and improve
recurrence-free outcomes for postoperative HCC. However,
overall survival is not affected.
One reason is that tumor could escape the host immune
surveillance and is difficult to cure. The human immune responses
against tumor are mainly dependent on the cellular immunity.
The host immune response in HCC patients is significantly
suppressed. The cytotoxic cell number and cytotoxicity are
necessary for efficient immunotherapy of tumors. CIK and LAK
cell immunotherapy are two of the most efficient approaches of

HCC. Some studies indicated that CIK or LAK cell transfusion
was safe and efficient to treat HCC [19–21].
Early animal experiments showed that immunotherapy was
effective in eliminating micrometastases [22]. Patients with fewer
burdens of micrometastases benefited more from immunotherapy
than those with larger burden of micrometastases [7]. Most of the
local recurrence of postoperative HCC occurs during the 6 months
after the operation, adoptive immunotherapy can eliminate these
residual cancer cells and destroy the proliferating cancer cells. So
immunotherapy could decrease recurrence rate and improve
recurrence-free outcome for postoperative HCC [23].
Immunotherapy can only eliminate micrometastases and can
not prevent multi-center recurrence of HCC [7]. Therefore, early
survival may differ but overall survival may not differ significantly.
Since recurrence is just one of the causes of death in HCC (the
other causes of death include liver failure, gastrointestinal
bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, renal failure, infection) [24],
different effective treatments for recurrence is another reason of no
difference of the overall survival.
Postoperative adjuvant TACE appears to be promising for
HCC paticents with multiple nodules .5 cm or vascular invasion,
so immunotherapy may be used in combination with TACE [25].
Interferon (IFN) has a significant beneficial effect after curative
treatment of HCC in terms of both survival and tumor recurrence,
so immunotherapy may be combined with IFN [26]. More studies
are needed to evaluate the efficacy of such treatment strategies.
A study by Shi et al. (2004) indicated that CIK cell treatment
can decrease HBV viral load [19]. A high viral load is an
independent risk factor for recurrence after resection of HBV￾related HCC [27]. So CIK treatment of HCC patients with HBV
infection could be a promising treatment strategy. This is of
particular interest since CIK treatment is typically not considered
in patients with active hepatitis A, B, or C infection.
Persistent fever was the only severe side effect observed in
patients receiving immunotherapy. As a matter of fact, immuno￾Figure 1. Identification process for eligible studies.

therapy may ameliorate some of the symptoms: patients had
increased appetite, improved sleep, gained body weight, and pain
relief [19]. Hence, immunotherapy may also improve the quality
of life of postoperative patients.
There are some limitations in our study. First, all six trials
included in the analysis were conducted in Asia, with two studies
published only in the Chinese language. The total sample size is
not very large. The follow-up time was not sufficiently long. Some
of the studies did not even report the follow-up time, Child-Pugh
score, tumor size, background liver diseases and alpha-fetoprotein
(AFP). Patients with information on 3-year overall survival was
limited (151 patients), and that might cause no difference was
observed between adoptive immunotherapy and no adjuvant
treatment for 3-year survival.
The reliability of this systemic review might also be influenced
by other factors. For example, not all the included studies reported
clinic random allocation concealment, so this meta-analysis may
have distribution and implementation bias.
Clinical studies with CIK cells are still in their infancy and only
involve a relatively small number of patients in most of these

studies. The relatively robust and simple cell culture procedures to
expand CIK cells have enabled this approach of adoptive cellular
immunotherapy to be widely studied. Based on the encouraging
experimental and clinical evidence currently available, random￾ized clinical trials are justifiable and should be done under
stringent compliance with the CONSORT principles. This will
certainly involve a large number of patients in order to
demonstrate statistical significance for a modest degree of outcome
superiority. Such studies are urgently needed in order to provide
unequivocal evidence of the clinical usefulness of immunotherapy,
so as to enable its integration into cancer treatment protocols to
improve overall survival [28].
