Abstract
International sustainable development goals for the elimination of viral hepatitis as a public
health problem by 2030 highlight the pressing need to optimize strategies for prevention,
diagnosis and treatment. Selected or transmitted resistance associated mutations (RAMs)
and vaccine escape mutations (VEMs) in hepatitis B virus (HBV) may reduce the success of
existing treatment and prevention strategies. These issues are particularly pertinent for
many settings in Africa where there is high HBV prevalence and co-endemic HIV infection,
but lack of robust epidemiological data and limited education, diagnostics and clinical care.
The prevalence, distribution and impact of RAMs and VEMs in these populations are
neglected in the current literature. We therefore set out to assimilate data for sub-Saharan
Africa through a systematic literature review and analysis of published sequence data, and
present these in an on-line database (https://livedataoxford.shinyapps.io/1510659619-
3Xkoe2NKkKJ7Drg/). The majority of the data were from HIV/HBV coinfected cohorts. The
commonest RAM was rtM204I/V, either alone or in combination with associated mutations,
and identified in both reportedly treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced adults. We also
identified the suite of mutations rtM204V/I + rtL180M + rtV173L, that has been associated
with vaccine escape, in over 1/3 of cohorts. Although tenofovir has a high genetic barrier to
resistance, it is of concern that emerging data suggest polymorphisms that may be associ￾ated with resistance, although the precise clinical impact of these is unknown. Overall, there
is an urgent need for improved diagnostic screening, enhanced laboratory assessment of
HBV before and during therapy, and sustained roll out of tenofovir in preference to lamivu￾dine alone. Further data are needed in order to inform population and individual approaches
to HBV diagnosis, monitoring and therapy in these highly vulnerable settings.

Author summary
The Global Hepatitis Health Sector Strategy is aiming for the elimination of viral hepatitis
as a public health threat by 2030. However, mutations associated with drug resistance and
vaccine escape may reduce the success of existing treatment and prevention strategies. In
the current literature, the prevalence, distribution and impact of hepatitis B virus (HBV)
mutations in many settings in Africa are neglected, despite the high prevalence of HBV
and co-endemic HIV infection. This systematic review describes the frequency, preva￾lence and co-occurrence of mutations associated with HBV drug resistance and vaccine
escape mutations in Africa. The findings suggest a high prevalence of these mutations in
some populations in sub-Saharan Africa. Scarce resources have contributed to the lack of
HBV diagnostic screening, inconsistent supply of drugs, and poor access to clinical moni￾toring, all of which contribute to drug and vaccine resistance. Sustainable long-term
investment is required to expand consistent drug and vaccine supply, to provide screening
to diagnose infection and to detect drug resistance, and to provide appropriate targeted
clinical monitoring for treated patients.
Introduction
In 2015, the World Health Organisation (WHO) estimated that 3.5% of the world’s population
(257 million people) were living with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, resulting in 887,000
deaths each year, mostly from complications including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) [1]. United Nations Sustainable Development Goals set out the challenge of elimina￾tion of viral hepatitis as a public health threat by the year 2030 [2]. One of the existing strate￾gies in the elimination toolbox is use of antiviral drugs in the form of nucleos(t)ide analogues
(NAs). Suppression of viraemia not only reduces inflammatory and fibrotic liver disease in the
individual receiving treatment but also reduces the risk of transmission. However, the emer￾gence of HBV resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) is a potentially significant concern for
the success of this strategy.
Africa is the continent with the second largest number of individuals with chronic HBV
(CHB) infection, with an estimated 6.1% of the adult population infected [1]. However, there
is little commitment and resource invested into the burden of this disease, and many barriers
are contributing to the epidemic [3,4]. Globally, less than 10% of the population with CHB are
diagnosed, with an even smaller proportion on treatment [1,4]. This proportion is likely to be
even lower in Africa. The situation in Africa is further complicated by the substantial public
health challenge of coendemic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and HBV; coinfection
worsens the prognosis in dually infected individuals [5]. There is also a lack of robust epidemi￾ological data on HBV from Africa [3,4].
Widespread use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV, incorporating NAs that also have
activity against HBV, may have an impact on HBV through improved rates of viraemic sup￾pression, but also potentially by driving the selection of RAMs. The WHO recommends
screening for Hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) in all HIV-1 infected individuals prior
to ART initiation, and for all pregnant women during antenatal visits, to improve the clinical
outcomes of people living with CHB and to enhance interventions that reduce the incidence of
new cases [6]. However, screening of HBsAg is not routinely performed in many settings in
Africa, with lack of implementation at least partially driven by cost and lack of programmes
for HBV treatment outside the setting of HIV coinfection. HBV infected patients either remain
untreated (most typical in the setting of monoinfection), or are exposed to antiviral drugs

without proper monitoring and often intermittently, putting them at risk of developing RAMs
(more likely in the setting of HIV coinfection) [4,7–10].
HBV is a DNA virus that replicates via an RNA intermediate, with reverse transcriptase
(RT) catalysing the transcription of RNA into DNA [7]. NAs that inhibit RT are therefore used
to prevent HBV replication, including lamivudine (3TC), entecavir (ETV) and tenofovir (con￾ventionally in the form of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), but more recently available as
the prodrug, tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF)), with mostly historical use of other agents
including telbivudine (LdT) and adefovir (ADV) [6,11]. Choice of TDF/TAF or ETV is deter￾mined by availability, cost, safety profile and barrier to resistance [4]. In Africa, the choice of
agent is usually limited to 3TC or TDF. Emergence of mutations happens because the RT
enzyme is error-prone and lacks the proofreading function required to repair errors during
transcription [7]; when these mutations confer a selective advantage by allowing the virus to
escape the effect of drug therapy, they will become amplified in the viral population. Some
RAMs confer resistance to one agent only, while others are associated with resistance to several
agents (Fig 1).
3TC was originally seen as a major breakthrough in treating HBV [19]. However, it is now
known to have a low genetic barrier to resistance and its long-term effectiveness is limited as a
result of resistance mutations in the ‘YMDD’ motif (tyrosine, methionine, aspartate, aspartate;
amino acids 203–206) in domain C of the viral polymerase (Pol). These occur with associated
upstream mutations in Pol domains A, B and in the B-C interdomain [7,15,16]. Among
chronic HBV monoinfected patients, incidence of HBV resistance to 3TC is as high as 20% per
year. In HIV/HBV coinfected patients, this can reach 90% over 5 years of treatment, as

resistance. HBV genes are shown in the coloured ovals. TDF = tenofovir, ETV = entecavir, 3TC = lamivudine. This figure incorporates data from eight studies; three were
identified by the systematic review presented in this manuscript [12–14] and five from the wider literature [7,15–18].

development of resistance is accelerated in HIV coinfection [5,20]. 3TC has also been associ￾ated with the induction of cross-resistance to emtricitabine (FTC), LdT, and at least partially
ETV, thus reducing the options for subsequent treatment [10].
TDF is widely used in treatment of both HIV and HBV and is generally well tolerated. TDF
has a high genetic barrier to resistance and maintains effective suppression of HBV in both
monoinfected and HIV/HBV coinfected individuals [5,7,10,21,22]. Although it has a recog￾nised association with nephrotoxicity in HIV treatment, current literature suggests it may be
better tolerated in HBV infection [11]. Conversely, African populations have a higher back￾ground of renal disease [23] and could be potentially more vulnerable to nephrotoxitiy from
TDF [24]. TAF delivers equally potent viraemic suppression at lower plasma levels, and is
therefore associated with reduced nephrotoxicity [25], but is not available in Africa at present.
HBV resistance to TDF is not well characterised, but there are emerging data from in vitro
studies associating Pol mutations rtA194T and rtN236T with decreased susceptibility [11,21].
Virological breakthrough on TDF therapy has been reported in two patients harbouring
rtS78T/sC69 mutations [17], and in another patient with multi-site polymerase mutations;
rtL80M, rtL180M, rtM204V/I, rtA200V, rtF221Y, rtS223A, rtT184A/L, rtR153Q, and rtV191I
[26]. The significance of these mutations needs to be further explored in clinical studies.
First line ART treatment regimens for HIV in sSA now almost universally include TDF,
and current guidelines also recommend TDF-based regimens in individuals with HBV/HIV
coinfection [27]. Accordingly, in both HIV monoinfection and HBV/HIV coinfection, use of
TDF has increased across much of Africa. Nevertheless, it remains the case that 3TC is used as
the only HBV-active agent in some settings [7,8], as well as in second line regimens, exempli￾fied by South Africa where second line ART substitutes Zidovudine (AZT) for TDF leaving
only 3TC coverage for HBV [28]. Among HBV/HIV coinfected children in South Africa
treated with regimens including 3TC and/or TDF, HBV viraemia has been demonstrated,
highlighting potential underlying HBV drug resistance [29].
ETV is another active agent, and is safe and well tolerated. However it is not active against
HIV and therefore has to be added to ART regimens rather than being part of the primary
backbone, is not recommended in pregnancy, and is not routinely available in most African
settings [30]. Resistance arises more commonly in the context of prior 3TC exposure [11,31],
which may limit its future potential in Africa, particularly in HIV endemic populations.
As a component of the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI), HBV preventive
vaccines have been rolled out in Africa since 1995 [4]. HBV vaccine is highly effective in pre￾vention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT); when administered to infants within 24
hours of birth followed by a dose given at 6 and another at 14 weeks to complete the primary
series, it reduces the rate of mother to child transmission by 85%–95% [32,33]. However, by
2016 only 11 countries in Africa had adopted birth dose HBV vaccination as part of the routine
infant immunisation schedule [34]. Changes in the S protein can result in vaccine escape
mutants (VEMs) [16,18], and also diagnostic escape mutations which result in false negative
HBsAg testing [16]. Mutations in HBV Pol can also lead to amino acid changes in the Surface
(S) protein due to overlapping reading frames (ORFs) in the genome [16]. Whilst the S protein
mutation sG145R has been identified as the major VEM, recently other mutations in S protein
have been associated with immune escape [16] Fig 1. There are very few data for VEMs in
Africa, but in other settings of high endemicity, VEMs can be common, as evidenced by a
reported prevalence of 28% in vaccinated HBV-infected children in Taiwan [35].
To date, no systematic review has assessed the geography and prevalence of HBV RAMs
and VEMs in Africa. An understanding of the extent to which these mutations circulate in
Africa is essential to improving HBV therapy in patients with and without HIV coinfection.
We therefore set out to describe the frequency, co-occurrence and distribution of RAMs and

VEMs in Africa, and to suggest whether changes are needed in recommendations for labora￾tory diagnostics and/or approaches to drug therapy or vaccine deployment. This will underpin
further research to identify and track relevant mutations in these populations.
Methods
Search strategy
Between October 2017 and January 2018, we searched the published literature, in MEDLINE
(PubMed; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed), SCOPUS (https://www.elsevier.com/
solutions/scopus) and EMBASE (https://www.elsevier.com/en-gb/solutions/embase￾biomedical-research). Our search strategy is detailed in S1 Table (documenting use of
PRISMA criteria and selection of studies) and S2 Table (listing our search criteria). The earliest
paper we identified on HBV drug resistance in Africa was published in 2007. We reviewed the
titles and abstracts matching the search terms and only included those relating to drug or vac￾cine resistance in HBV infection, including only those that presented original data and had
undergone peer review. All retrieved articles were in English, therefore no exclusion in relation
to language was required.
For each publication we recorded reference, publication year, study design, sample size,
study population, proportion of participants who tested HBsAg+ or HBV DNA+, country,
year(s) of specimen collection, genotype identified, antiviral treatment, sequencing method,
gene sequenced, number of sequenced samples, participant recruitment site and sequence
accession number. Data were curated using MS Excel software (Microsoft, Redmond, WA).
RAMs reported in published sequences not represented in primary studies
We expanded our search for evidence of RAMs by identifying publicly available HBV
sequences from Africa, that had not been included in the results of our primary literature
search. We used both the Hepatitis B Virus database (https://hbvdb.ibcp.fr/ [36] and Hepatitis
Virus Diversity Research Alignments database (http://hvdr.bioinf.wits.ac.za/alignments/) [37].
Analysis
In order to determine the prevalence of RAMs and VEMs, we first reported these using the
denominator (total number of HBV positive patients) and numerator (total number of HBV
positive patients with the specified mutation) as reported in published studies. We also pooled
data by country in order to provide regional estimates. Downloaded sequences were managed
using Sequence editor, database and analysis platform, SSE version 1.3, for analysis [38].
Data visualisation
We developed an R package, gene.alignment.tables, for the visualisation of the sequence data
in this study; this is available on Github [39] and can be used for visualising generic gene
sequence datasets. The package was developed by University of Oxford’s Interactive Data Net￾work and a specific instance of the visualisation is hosted as a Shiny app which can be viewed
here: https://livedataoxford.shinyapps.io/1510659619-3Xkoe2NKkKJ7Drg/ [40].
Results
The initial search yielded 56 articles in MEDLINE, 150 in SCOPUS and 150 in EMBASE. Of
these, 32, 136 and 119 were excluded from search results of MEDLINE, SCOPUS and
EMBASE respectively, as they did not did not meet the inclusion criteria. After de-duplication,
37 articles were included. 27 articles identified from MEDLINE, SCOPUS and EMBASE were

identical; five unique articles were included from EMBASE, four from SCOPUS and one from
MEDLINE. A total of 37 articles were downloaded in full (S1 Table (part II); S3 Table).
Study characteristics
Epidemiological data for HBV represented by the 37 studies we identified are summarised in
Table 1. Studies included were from Southern Africa (Botswana, Mozambique, South Africa,
Zambia and Zimbabwe), East Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Sudan and Uganda), West
Africa (Cote d’Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau and Nigeria) and Central Africa (Cam￾eroon, Gabon). There was considerable heterogeneity in recruitment protocols and exposure
to anti-viral treatment. Twenty-six studies recruited from hospitals, three studies recruited
from the community [8,41,42] and eight studies did not specify where recruitment was under￾taken [10,43–49]. All studies were observational.
Study populations were categorised as follows:
• HBV/HIV coinfected patients: (n = 28 studies), [8–10,12–14,20,43–48,50–56,58–
62,64,67,70];
• HBV infected with and without HIV coinfection: (n = 8 studies), [41–43,57,63,65,66,68];
• Chronic HBV monoinfection: (n = 1 study), [69].
Antiviral treatment exposure varied as follows:
• Treatment-naïve: (n = 8 studies), [14,46–48,63,64,68,70];
• 3TC-based regimen only: (n = 10 studies), [8,9,20,44,45,49,53,59,61,69];
• Regimens including 3TC or TDF: (n = 6 studies), [10,13,51,52,55,65];
• Mixed regimen where some received 3TC, others TDF, while others left untreated; (n = 7
studies), [12,50,54,56,60,62,66];
• Treatment regimen not specified: (n = 6 studies), [41–43,57,58,67].
HBV amino acid polymorphisms were studied from within the following proteins;
• Pol only (n = 13 studies), [8,9,12–14,20,44,53,55,56,59,63,68]; only one of these used a deep
sequencing method [20];
• S only (n = 3 studies), [43,57,65];
• Pol and S (n = 12 studies),[10,41,45,48,51,52,54,58,60,62,64,67];
• Pol, S and PC/BCP (n = 4 studies), [47,50,61,69];
• S and PC/BCP region (n = 3 studies), [42,46,70];
• Whole genome (n = 2 studies), [49,66].
All studies, except for two [53,68], specified the HBV genotype (S3 Table & S2 Fig).
Prevalence of HBsAg, HBeAg and HDV coinfection
The prevalence rates of HBsAg in these study cohorts ranged from 3%-26%; however, the pop￾ulations included were highly selected and therefore not necessarily representative of the gen￾eral population, particularly as a result of a strong bias towards HIV-infection (Table 1). Only
three studies included in this review reported on HDV prevalence: two studies did not detect

RAMs identified in African cohorts
The co-occurrence and distribution of HBV RAMs and VEMs are summarised according to
the region where they were identified (Fig 2). This illustrates the patchy and limited data that
are available, with South Africa, Ghana and Cameroon best represented, but with large areas
(especially in northern and central Africa) not represented at all in the literature.
Although 35 studies specified the HBV genotype, it was only possible to group RAMs
according to genotype in fourteen studies [8,9,13,14,44,46,47,50,51,56,60–62,69] (S1 Fig; S2
Fig). The remaining 21 studies generally reported the genotypes identified, but did not specifi￾cally state the genotype of HBV within which RAMs were identified.
We have developed an interactive tool to display the genomic positions of RAMs identified
through our literature review alongside relevant metadata. This can be accessed on-line here:

Overall, the most prevalent RAM was rtM204V/I in both treatment experienced and treat￾ment naïve individuals, and occurring either alone or in combination with other polymor￾phisms rtL80I/V, rtV173L, rtL180M, rtA181S, rtT184S, rtA200V and/or rtS202S (Fig 3);
mutations among individuals with and without exposure to HBV therapy are listed in S4 Table
and S5 Table, respectively). This mutation was present in 29 studies at a highly variable preva￾lence of between 0.4% [12] and 76% [69]. Across all cohorts, the mutation was present in 208/
2569 (8%) of all individuals represented. The mutation, by itself, was most prevalent in South
Africa; on pooling data for three studies from this setting, it was present in both treatment expe￾rienced and treatment naïve patients (n = 13/17, 76% [69] and n = 16/72, 22% [67,68] respec￾tively). In addition to South Africa, rtM204I/V was also frequent in Malawi among treatment
experienced patients (n = 24/154, 16% [20,45]) (Fig 3), and in genotype non-A infection: in this
setting, the mutation was detected in genotype C infection (n = 2/17, 12% [69]) (S2 Fig).
The rtM204I/V mutation by itself confers resistance to 3TC; in combination with A194T it
may also be associated with reduced efficacy to TDF, and in combination with L180M and
V173L with vaccine escape, through corresponding substitutions in the surface antigen sites
targeted by neutralising antibodies. Although TDF has a high genetic barrier to resistance, and

summary of RAMs identified from each study is presented (Fig 2, S4 Table, S5 Table). Prevalence of RAMs for a specific country was determined by grouping all
studies from that country that reported a specific mutation. We used all individuals who tested HBsAg positive to generate a denominator in order to provide a
conservative estimate of RAM prevalence, and the numerator was the total number of individuals with that specific mutation from these studies. A: treatment
naïve; B: treatment experienced.

is associated with reliable suppression of HBV viraemia [7,10,21,22], mutations rtN236T and
rtA194T, which have been linked with resistance to both TDF and ADV [7], have been identi￾fied in Southern Africa in both treatment naïve [14] and treatment experienced [10] patients.
WHO guidelines recommend a first-line regimen including TDF in HIV/HBV coinfected
patients [6], and the South African Department of Health HIV/AIDS treatment guideline
included TDF as first-line regimen from 2010 [71], however we found a minority of studies (9/
37, 24%) reporting TDF-containing regimens for HIV/HBV coinfected individuals. As antici￾pated, most of the studies that did use TDF were carried out after 2010, whereas those that
used 3TC were generally earlier (S3 Table).
From this dataset, it is difficult to ascertain whether RAMs are genuinely more prevalent in geno￾type A infection, or this simply reflects enrichment of genotype A in sub-Saharan African popula￾tions (S2 Fig). Interpreting RAMs according to sub-genotypes was difficult since most studies did
not specify sub-genotype and others did not indicate which RAMs were identified in which geno￾type. Of concern is the detection of RAMs even in reportedly treatment naïve individuals (Fig 3 &
S4 Table), suggesting that RAMs are being transmitted. A study in South Africa that recruited 3TC￾naïve HBV infected adults with or without HIV, reported rtM204I in 13/35 (37%) individuals [68].

duplication of results, we excluded fourteen studies already identified by our literature review
that had submitted their sequences to GenBank (S3 Table). RAMs in the additional 69 isolates
were as follows:
• rtM204V in genotype A (2/69, 2.9% of sequences), this occurred in combination with
rtL180M;
• rtM204V + rtL180M in genotype E (1/69, 1.5%);
• rt180M + rtA181V in genotype E (1/69 (1.5%);
• rtQ215S identified in genotype D (4/69, 5.8%).
All these mutations are associated with 3TC resistance; rtA181V has also been associated
with reduced susceptibility to TDF [7,15].
In the S gene, the most prevalent mutations were:
• sD144A/E/G occurring in genotype A (6/69, 8.7%), D (10/69, 14.5%) and E (7/69, 10.1%)
associated with VEM;
• sI110L occurring in genotype A (3/69, 4.3%), D (4/69, 5.8%) and E (11/69, 15.9%) associated
with immunoglobulin resistance.
VEMs
VEMs were identified in Central, East, West and Southern Africa (Fig 2). However, it was not
possible to ascertain whether individuals harbouring these mutations had been vaccinated
against HBV infection. The most common VEM was the triple mutation rtV173L + rtL180M
+ rtM204I/V, found in the Pol gene. This suite of mutations was identified in 14 studies
[12,13,20,44,50–55,58–60,62], at a pooled prevalence of 4% (57/1462). Another significant
VEM, sG145K/R [16], was identified in six studies [12,42,47,57,60,62] and sM133L/T, associ￾ated with VEM, immunoglobulin and diagnostic escape mutation [12,48], was identified in
seven studies [12,41,47,48,57,62,70] (Fig 2).
Discussion
Summary
To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review that assesses RAMs and VEMs for HBV in
Africa. The high rates of HBV infection among HIV infected individuals in some locations
including Cameroon [60] and South Africa [10] could be an indication that HBV infection has
been previously under-reported, possibly due to lack of routine screening, poor awareness,
stigma, high costs and limited clinical and laboratory infrastructure [4,8–10,45,53]. The litera￾ture suggests a widespread exposure of the HIV-infected population to 3TC-based treatment.
This may be changing over time in line with current ART treatment recommendations (regi￾mens for Africa summarised in S6 Table), but the introduction of TDF-based regimens for
HIV treatment has been inconsistent, and TDF monotherapy is not consistently available for
HBV infection in the absence of HIV.
In keeping with other settings, the most common RAM identified here was rtM204I/V,
either alone or in combination with compensatory mutations rtL180M ± rtV173L. Of concern,
rtM204V/I was seen in 76% of treatment experienced patients [69] and 22% of treatment naïve
patients [67,68] in South Africa. A review of worldwide incidence of RAMs among treatment
naïve patients also described rtM204V/I as the most frequent, but with a much lower preva￾lence of 5% [72]. The contribution of unreported or undocumented 3TC exposure in the
Drug and vaccine resistance in HBV in Africa
PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0006629 August 6, 2018 13 / 24

reportedly treatment naïve populations remains to be determined. A European study demon￾strated that the most frequent primary mutation was rtM204V/I, found in 49% of treatment
experienced patients [73], while in China rtM204I, rtN236T and rtL180M+rtM204V+-
rtV173L/rtS202G were also the most prevalent RAMs [74].
The triple mutation rtM204V + rtL180M + rtV173L has been identified in East, West and
Central Africa [20,44,51–54,59]. This combination of polymorphisms is associated with both
vaccine escape and resistance to 3TC and other L-nucleoside analogues [20,44,51,54,59,60].
Interestingly, this triple mutation has not been reported in the Southern African region to
date, which is likely to reflect the composition of the study populations.
Clinical and public health significance of RAMs
Apart from the nature of drugs being used for HBV treatment, other reported predictors of
HBV drug resistance include HBV viral load, HBV intra host heterogeneity, HBeAg status,
host body mass index and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity [20,75,76]. Individu￾als with rtM204V/I plus compensatory mutations typically exhibit high HBV DNA levels [20]
and are therefore highly infectious to others. The spread of RAMs may lead to a rise in drug
resistance in treatment naïve chronic HBV infection, representing a substantial challenge for
Africa and highlighting an imperative to ensure routine use of TDF in preference to, or in
combination with, 3TC-based therapy.
Although these data provide a preliminary picture of the prevalence of RAMs in some set￾tings, there are no recommendations to stipulate any specific prevalence threshold above
which HBV drug resistance mutations represent a significant barrier to successful treatment at
a population level, and/or RAM prevalence thresholds that should trigger a switch to alterna￾tive first-line therapy. For HIV, surveillance for transmission of RAMs is based on screening
recently infected, treatment naive individuals, and classifies drug resistance using thresholds of
<5%, 5–15%, and >15% to stratify the risk to public health [77]. Similar thresholds and rec￾ommendations for HBV could help to underpin the assimilation of epidemiological data and
to unify treatment approaches.
TDF resistance
The identification of mutations associated with reduced TDF susceptibility are of concern, as
they suggest the potential for increasing prevalence of polymorphisms that confer partial or
complete viral escape from a drug that to date has not been widely associated with resistance.
There is now potential for increasing selection of TDF resistance as this drug becomes more
widely used. However, as a new first line single tablet option incorporating 3TC, TDF and
Dolutegravir (DTG) (triple therapy abbreviated to ‘LTD’) emerges as a recommended option
for HIV treatment in Africa, surveillance is needed to determine the clinical outcomes for
HBV [78].
If clinically significant, TDF resistance mutations may still represent a particular problem
for many African settings, as resource constraints make it unrealistic to provide baseline
screening for RAMs, or to monitor patients on treatment with serial viral load measurements.
Despite these potential concerns, it has been shown that TDF is effective even in the presence
of RAMs and that there is comparable efficacy among 3TC-experienced and NA-naïve patients
[79].
VEM
VEM were identified in 16 different countries in East, West, Central and Southern Africa.
Information on vaccine exposure was not available, but there are two strands of evidence to
Drug and vaccine resistance in HBV in Africa
PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0006629 August 6, 2018 14 / 24

support significant population exposure to HBV vaccination. First, vaccination has been pro￾gressively rolled out in most countries in sSA since the mid-1990’s; second, most HBsAg muta￾tions reported by these studies are located within the common immunodominant B cell
epitope (aa 124–147) in which selection of polymorphisms is associated with HBV vaccination
[80,81].
VEM have been more robustly reported from Asia, in settings where the HBV infant vacci￾nation programme is well established; for example, in Taiwan, VEM prevalence among vacci￾nated children increased from 7.8% to 23.1% within 15 years of the launch of the universal
vaccine program, although the decline in VEM prevalence thereafter may be partly related to a
smaller HBV carrier pool [80]. HBV infection despite immunoprophylaxis can occur either as
a consequence of MTCT of pre-existing VEM, or as a result of de novo selection of escape
mutations from vaccine- induced immune responses, particularly in the setting of delayed vac￾cination [80,81].The HBV genotype sequence used for vaccines may potentially have an influ￾ence on immunogenicity against non-vaccine genotypes, but there are limited data to support
this [82]. Only 11 African countries recommend the first HBV vaccine dose at birth, in con￾trast to the majority of African countries in which HBV vaccination is delayed until 6 weeks of
age [33]. It is likely that this delay not only provides a window of infection but also increases
the possibility of transmitted VEM and/or emergence of new escape mutations.
High maternal HBV viral load and immunosuppression are other risk factors associated
with VEM among infants [80]; both of these are pertinent for emergence of VEMs in Africa
given that HBV viral load testing is not routinely available, and HIV is highly prevalent in
some populations. Effective PMTCT strategies in Africa, including screening and treating
antenatal women, increasing access to viral load monitoring, and introducing HBV birth dose
vaccine will help to decrease the prevalence of VEM [4,33,83].
HDV/HBV coinfection
One study from our literature review reported a high HDV prevalence of 25%; however, in
this cohort, RAMs occurred in individuals with HBV monoinfection [56]. Given that HDV is
characteristically associated with decreased HBV replication [84], it is possible that emergence
of HBV RAMs is altered in this setting. However, as the true prevalence and impact of HDV in
sSA is not known [85], further studies are needed to determine the impact of HDV coinfection
on HBV RAMs.
Limitations of current data
Screening for HBV infection is not routinely performed in many African settings and therefore
the true prevalence and characteristics of HBV infection are not known [4,7–10]. We identi￾fied very few published studies; only a minority of patients had HBV sequencing undertaken,
and there were no data from certain regions of Africa. This highlights the substantial problem
of HBV neglect in Africa, and a specific blind-spot relating to sequence data [4]. Identifying
the true prevalence of resistance mutations, and characterising the populations in which these
are selected and enriched, is currently not possible due to sparse data and lack of clear descrip￾tions of the denominator population. Most such studies do not perform a truly systematic
assessment, but focus on high risk groups–particularly including those with HIV/HBV coin￾fection: of the 37 studies included here, only one exclusively reported on participants who
were HBV mono-infected [69]. Although we have made every effort to assimilate the relevant
data to build up a regional picture for Africa, the heterogeneity between studies makes it diffi￾cult to draw robust conclusions from pooled data. These findings are a reflection of the little
Drug and vaccine resistance in HBV in Africa
PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0006629 August 6, 2018 15 / 24

attention paid towards the burden of this disease in Africa and the neglect in robust epidemio￾logical data.
Only nine studies undertook a longitudinal approach to detection of drug resistance [8–
10,20,44,45,49,52,53]. The results of the other 28 studies that undertook a cross-sectional
approach could be skewed by the timing of recruitment of study participants, with a risk of
under-representation of drug resistance if screening is undertaken only at baseline, and poten￾tially an over-representation if screening is undertaken in patients with HIV coinfection, who
are more at risk of advanced disease and prolonged drug exposure. As most of these studies
recruited individuals from hospital settings, this raises the latter possibility.
Mutations across the whole genome might be relevant in determining resistance [86]. How￾ever, most of the included studies analysed only defined genes from within the HBV genome;
only two sequenced the whole genome, and these determined consensus sequence. This poten￾tially results in an under-representation of RAMs and VEMs that may be present as low num￾bers of quasispecies, but could become significant if selected out by exposure to drug or vaccine.
In studies that reported RAMs among treatment naïve individuals, the literature suggests
that sequence analysis was performed prior to ART initiation. However, we cannot exclude the
possibility that that some of these participants had prior ART exposure. Due to the nature of
the cohorts that have been studied, most of the RAMs identified were from HIV/HBV coin￾fected individuals. It is possible that HIV increases the risk of HBV RAMs both in terms of
drug exposure, and also as a function of increased HBV viral loads. A study from Malawi dem￾onstrated the rapid emergence of 3TC resistance in HIV coinfection, with virtually all treat￾ment naïve HBeAg positive individuals starting antiviral treatment showing emergence of
rtM204I by six months. Likewise, a study carried out in Italy revealed that patients with HIV
coinfection were more likely to harbour the rtM204V mutation and to show multiple muta￾tions compared to HBV monoinfected patients [87]. It would be worth further exploration of
this observation in Africa, as there are currently very limited data.
Challenges and opportunities for Africa
A major challenge for Africa is to improve coverage rates of infant vaccination, deploy catch￾up vaccination programmes for older children and adults, adopt widespread screening and
develop treatment programmes for HBV. While HBV vaccine is effective, gaps in vaccine cov￾erage in Africa can be demonstrated by the high perinatal transmission rate of HBV in sSA
(estimated at 38% among women with a high HBV viral load) and the observation that up to
1% of newborns in sSA are still infected with HBV [88]. Sustained efforts are required to build
robust PMTCT programmes that deliver screening and treatment for antenatal women, and
timely administration of HBV birth vaccine for their babies [33,83].
Although the WHO recommends monitoring for the development of drug resistance once
on therapy [6], implementation remains challenging as viral load monitoring and sequencing
are both rarely available [7]; despite the advancement and availability of HIV testing and mon￾itoring, in many settings it remains uncommon to monitor HIV viral load after ART initiation
[89,90]. Affordable, accessible and sustainable platforms for quantifying both HIV and HBV
viral loads remain an important priority for many settings in Africa, given the lack of on-treat￾ment monitoring in many settings. Given the simplicity and relative ease of collection, prepa￾ration and transport of dried-blood-spot (DBS) samples [91], adopting DBS testing could
improve access to HBV diagnosis, viral load monitoring and linkage to care, especially in areas
with limited access to laboratory facilities.
Development of a cheap, rapid test for the detection of the most frequently observed RAMs
and VEMs should be considered as a potentially cost-effective strategy for Africa. Proof of
Drug and vaccine resistance in HBV in Africa

principle for a rapid test for diagnosis and detection of resistance has been demonstrated by
the GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) [92]. A similar approach
has been applied for HBV through use of a multiplex ligation-dependent probe real time PCR
(MLP-RT-PCR) [93]. Although this assay is able to detect RAMs quickly and cheaply, there
are still limitations as the test requires high viral load samples, is based on detection of known
RAMs from within discrete regions of the genome, and may not identify RAMs that are pres￾ent as minor quasispecies.
New metagenomic sequencing platforms, such as Illumina and Nanopore, provide the oppor￾tunity for whole deep genome sequencing, which can reveal the full landscape of HBV mutations
in individual patients, quantify the prevalence of drug resistance mutations among HBV quasi￾species, and determine the relationship between these polymorphisms and treatment outcomes
[87]. Nanopore technology also has the potential to develop into an efficient point of care test
that could detect viral infection and coinfection, as well as determining the presence of VEMs
and RAMs [94], but is currently limited by cost and concerns about high error rates.
There have been few studies looking at the correlation between genotype, clinical outcomes
of disease, response to antiviral therapy and RAMs/VEMs, but none from Africa. Studies out￾side Africa have shown that genotype A is more prone to immune/vaccine escape mutants,
pre-S mutants associated with immune suppression, drug associated mutations and HCC in
HIV/HBV coinfected participants [46,87,95]. Studies investigating the role of genotypes in
predicting response to antiviral therapy and their association with various types of mutations
are urgently needed in Africa, particularly in light of the high frequency of genotype A infec￾tion and high population exposure to antiviral agents that have been rolled out over the past
two decades as a component of first-line ART.
Existing infrastructure for diagnosis, clinical monitoring and drug therapy for HIV repre￾sents an opportunity for linkage with HBV care. Particularly in settings of limited resource,
joining up services for screening and management of blood-borne virus infection could be a
cost-effective pathway to service improvements.
Conclusions
This review highlights the very limited data for HBV RAMs and VEMs that are available from
Africa. Scarce resources resulting in lack of diagnostic screening, inconsistent supply of HBV
drugs and vaccines, and poor access to clinical monitoring contribute to drug and vaccine
resistance, potentially amplifying the risk of ongoing transmission and adding to the long￾term burden of HBV morbidity and mortality in Africa. We call for urgent action to gather
and analyse better data, particularly representing the HBV monoinfected population, and for
improved access to TDF.
HBV RAMs and VEMs have been identified in several African countries among HIV/HBV
coinfected and HBV monoinfected patients, before and during treatment with NAs but the
data are currently insufficient to allow us to form a clear picture of the prevalence, distribution
or clinical significance of these mutations. Overall, the data we describe suggest a significantly
higher prevalence of drug resistance in some African populations than has been described else￾where, and that is not confined only to drug-exposed populations, highlighting an urgent need
for better population screening, assessment of HBV infection before and during therapy, and
increasing roll out of TDF in preference to 3TC. At present, TDF accessibility is largely con￾fined to HIV/HBV coinfected individuals; we now need to advocate to make monotherapy
available for HBV monoinfected individuals. However, there are uncertainties as to whether
its long-term use might result in nephrotoxicity, and potentially in an increase in selection of
TDF RAMs.

We should ideally aim for the goals of a combined HBV test that includes diagnosis of infec￾tion, genotype and presence of RAMs/VEMs; new sequencing platforms such as Nanopore
make this technically possible, although cost remains a significant barrier at present. Sustain￾able long-term investment is required to expand consistent drug and vaccine supply, to pro￾vide screening infection and for drug resistance, and to provide appropriate targeted clinical
monitoring for treated patients.

Data summarised from fourteen studies published between 2009–2017 (inclusive). 21 studies
were not represented here as they did not specifically indicate which genotype individuals with
RAMs belonged to. Available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5774091 [96].

S2 Fig. Distribution of HBV genotypes and prevalence of HBV resistance associated
mutations (RAMs) in Pol/RT proteins in geno-A and geno-non-A samples. A: Distribu￾tion of HBV genotypes derived from 35 studies reporting resistance associated mutations
(RAMs) in Africa published between 2009 to 2017 (inclusive); B: Prevalence of HBV resis￾tance associated mutations (RAMs) in Pol/RT proteins in geno-A and geno-non-A samples.
These data are derived from 14 studies of HBV drug resistance in Africa published between
2007 and 2017 (inclusive). 21 studies were not represented here as they did not specifically
indicate which genotype individuals with RAMs belonged to. We had more geno-A samples
represented than other samples, we therefore combined samples from other genotypes that
had RAMs (B, C, D, E, D/E) to form geno-non-A samples. We then compared prevalence of
Pol/RT mutation between geno-A samples to geno-non-A samples. Prevalence of RT/Pol
mutations for a specific genotype(geno-A/geno-non-A) was determined by grouping all
studies with geno-A/geno-non-A infection that reported a specific mutation; the denomina￾tor was the total number of individuals infected with geno-A/geno-non-A from these stud￾ies and the numerator was the total number of individuals infected with geno-A/geno-non￾A with that specific mutation.
