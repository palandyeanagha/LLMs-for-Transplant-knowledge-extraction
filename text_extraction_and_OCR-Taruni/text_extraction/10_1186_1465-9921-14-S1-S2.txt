Abstract
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the most prevalent idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, is associated with a poor
prognosis. An accurate diagnosis of IPF is essential for optimal management. The recent ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT
recommendations on the diagnosis and management of IPF were developed from a systematic review of the
published literature. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scanning has a central role in the IPF
diagnostic pathway with formal designation of criteria for an HRCT pattern of UIP. In the correct clinical context, a
UIP pattern on HRCT is indicative of a definite diagnosis of IPF without the need for a surgical lung biopsy.
However, although the 2011 ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT statement is a major advance, the application of guideline
recommendations by clinicians has identified limitations that need to be addressed in future statements. Key
problems include: 1) the lack of management recommendations for the highly prevalent clinical scenarios of
probable and possible IPF; 2) the ongoing confusion about the diagnostic role of bronchoalveolar lavage
(reflecting ambiguity in the current recommendation); 3) HRCT misdiagnosis by less experienced radiologists,
increasingly recognised as a major problem; and 4) the lack of integration of clinical data, including the treated
course of disease, in the designation of the diagnostic likelihood of IPF.
Introduction
Idiopathic Interstitial Pneumonias (IIPs) make up a het￾erogeneous group of diseases, which are collectively
included in the umbrella term “Interstitial Lung Diseases
(ILDs)” [1]. In 2002, the ATS/ERS multidisciplinary panel
proposed a classification of IIPs that comprises clinico￾pathological entities such as Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis
(IPF), Nonspecific Interstitial Pneumonia (NSIP), Respira￾tory Bronchiolitis-associated Interstitial Lung Disease (RB￾ILD), Cryptogenic Organising Pneumonia (COP), Acute
Interstitial Pneumonia (AIP), Desquamative Interstitial
Pneumonia (DIP), and lymphoid interstitial pneumonia
(LIP) [1].
IPF is defined as a specific form of chronic, progressively
fibrosing IIP, occurring primarily in older adults, limited
to the lungs, and associated with the histopathological
and/or radiologic pattern of unspecified interstitial pneu￾monia (UIP) [2]. IPF is the most common and pernicious
ILD [3]. In addition, the histologically confirmed UIP pat￾tern of IPF is shown to be associated with a significantly
worse prognosis than other histologic patterns of chronic
interstitial pneumonia [4]. The diagnosis of IPF requires
an integrated multidisciplinary approach involving pulmo￾nologists, radiologists, and pathologists. Hence, establish￾ing an accurate diagnosis of IPF is a challenging process.
This clinical review focuses on the revised diagnostic
criteria (2011) for IPF and discusses the feasibility of their
application in the clinical setting. Key problems that have
emerged with the application of the guidelines by clini￾cians are discussed.
The ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT 2011 revised diagnostic
criteria

lung fibrosis, computed tomography (CT) findings and, in Correspondence: Athol.Wells@rbht.nhs.uk

cases with CT abnormalities that are not classical for IPF,
the use of pathological criteria. Diagnostic uncertainties,
partly due to the multiple different ways in which physi￾cians approach IPF (e.g. the availability of appropriate lung
biopsy specimens and accurate medical histories) along
with the variability in the natural history of disease and in
HRCT appearances; and the lack of a validated algorithm
for excluding known causes of lung fibrosis all contribute
to the inherent confusion surrounding this topic.
The lack of a known cause of lung fibrosis represents a
key factor in the diagnostic process. Even when a surgical
lung biopsy (SLB) reveals a histopathological pattern of
UIP, a definitive diagnosis required the exclusion of other
known causes of ILD, including collagen vascular disease,
drug toxicity, and various environmental exposures
(Table 1) [1,5]. In some patients, surgical lung biopsy (SLB)
is unnecessary as the diagnosis of IPF is secure, based on
typical clinical and HRCT features. The statement in 2000
identified four major and four minor diagnostic criteria for
IPF, with a requirement for the presence of all four major
and three of the four minor criteria (Table 2) [1,5].
However, all four minor criteria have significant limita￾tions. The requirements for a slow onset of disease and a
duration of at least three months do not acknowledge the
fact that some IPF patients first present with an acute
exacerbation. Furthermore, in patients with symptoms
from pre-existing smoking-related lung damage, it can be
impossible to accurately evaluate the separate symptomatic
course of coexisting IPF. Finally, the presence of crackles
on auscultation is a highly non-specific sign.
The updated evidence-based guidelines for diagnosis
and management of IPF were devised in 2011 by the col￾laborative effort of the American Thoracic Society, the
European Respiratory Society, the Japanese Respiratory
Society, and the Latin American Thoracic Association.
The main objective was to provide recommendations on
the diagnosis and management of IPF, based on a thor￾ough review of the evidence published to date, and the
use of expert opinion only when the evidence base is
inadequate.
The diagnostic criteria from 2000 indicate that in the
correct clinical context, the finding of a UIP pattern on a
high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan may
be sufficient to diagnose IPF, without the need to perform
SLB [1]. This conclusion is consolidated in the 2011 guide￾lines, in which HRCT has a primary role in the IPF diag￾nostic pathway. Imaging criteria for the diagnosis of a UIP
pattern on HRCT include the presence of bilateral, predo￾minantly subpleural, basal reticular abnormalities and the
absence of additional features considered incompatible
with a diagnosis of IPF. However, these HRCT features are
only indicative that IPF is a possible diagnosis: a definite
diagnosis requires the presence of honeycombing, a much
more specific feature of a UIP pattern [2]. The HRCT
features of honeycombing are, clustered cystic air space,
usually of comparable diameters (3–10 mm, occasionally
larger), mainly subpleural and characterised by thick
well-defined walls [2]. Honeycombing on HRCT in an
appropriate distribution has a positive predictive value for
a histologic pattern of UIP ranging from 90-100% [6
].
The ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT 2011 guidelines clearly state
the precise HRCT features that meet the criteria for
‘‘UIP’’, ‘‘possible UIP’’ and ‘‘inconsistent with UIP’’ patterns
(Tables 3 &4) [2]. In the appropriate clinical setting, satis￾faction of HRCT criteria for a pattern of UIP obviates a
diagnostic SLB. In patients demonstrating features that
meet the criteria for ‘‘possible UIP’’ and/or ‘‘inconsistent
with UIP’’ patterns on HRCT images, a SLB should be
considered. Specific combinations of HRCT and histo￾pathology patterns are also provided in the statement with
delineation of the likelihood of IPF as definite, probable or
possible [2].
A multidisciplinary, dynamic approach, with the input of
clinicians, radiologists, and pathologists has been shown to
improve diagnostic accuracy [7,8] and is strongly recom￾mended. In the ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT statement, no
attempt is made to define minimum standards required
for the process of multidisciplinary evaluation.
Management guidance in relation to diagnostic
likelihood of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
A key problem in applying the updated guidelines on
management is related to the designation of IPF as “defi￾nite”, “probable” or “possible” (Tables 3 &4) [2]. On one
level, this aspect of the guidelines is a major advance as
there has been no previous definition of probable and
possible IPF, even though both are frequently encoun￾tered in clinical practice. However, it must be acknowl￾edged that the recommendations provided in the new
evidence-based guidelines are focused on patients with a
definite diagnosis of IPF and are often difficult to apply
when the diagnosis of IPF is less certain. When a realistic
differential diagnosis exists (usually chronic hypersensi￾tivity pneumonitis [HP] or fibrotic non-specific intersti￾tial pneumonia [NSIP]), the less interventional approach
recommended in IPF may lead to the under-treatment of
disorders other than IPF, with major adverse consequences.

The appropriate recommendation is also made that a SLB
should be performed when the diagnosis of IPF is uncer￾tain. However, a significant minority (perhaps a large min￾ority) of patients with suspected IPF cannot undergo a SLB
procedure, either because of contraindications (comorbid
conditions, disease severity, advanced age), or because the
patient declines the procedure. Thus, IPF patients present￾ing with non-diagnostic scans must undergo a SLB or be
disenfranchised by current diagnostic criteria. This scenario
is especially a difficulty in elderly patients who are unwill￾ing or unable to undergo a SLB and are therefore debarred
from receiving novel therapies which are licensed for use
in definite IPF. The most prevalent problem is the IPF
patient without honeycombing on HRCT but with a predo￾minantly basal and sub-pleural distribution of reticular
abnormalities that is typical of IPF, which is also seen in
chronic HP and fibrotic NSIP. There is an urgent need to
repeat the study of Fell et al. [9], in which it was shown
that in patients aged over 65 with reticular abnormalities
(as described above) but no honeycombing, the diagnostic
likelihood of IPF exceeded 95%. Confirmation of this find￾ing in another large cohort would allow the current HRCT
criteria for a diagnosis of definite IPF to be expanded.
The best diagnostic use of bronchoalveolar
lavage
The value of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in the diagno￾sis of IPF is contentious. In patients with suspected IPF,
the most important application of BAL is to increase the
index of suspicion for alternative disorders, including HP
and NSIP, by the demonstration of a lymphocytosis
>30%. The ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT 2011 guidelines make a
weak negative recommendation that BAL cellular analysis
should not be performed in the diagnostic evaluation of
IPF in the majority of patients, but may be appropriate in
a minority of patients [2].
However, feedback from European practitioners indi￾cates that this recommendation has caused a good deal
of confusion as it can be applied to either of two very
separate scenarios. At the time of BAL, a HRCT scan has
almost always been performed. If HRCT features are clas￾sical for IPF, and the clinical context is correct, the
patient does not have “suspected IPF” but “definite IPF”.
If the HRCT features are not classical for IPF, but IPF is
suspected, the diagnostic overlap includes IPF/NSIP,
IPF/HP, IPF/sarcoidosis and IPF/unclassifiable. It is
not helpful to combine these two scenarios in a single

recommendation. Two independent statements are
required. Thus, some clinicians take the recommendation
to apply to patients, with clinical and HRCT features
typical of IPF on HRCT (“definite IPF”). Others assume
that the recommendation does indeed apply to “sus￾pected IPF”, in which, by definition, the likelihood of IPF
is probable or possible but realistic differential diagnoses
exist, usually of HP or NSIP. These two scenarios differ
radically.
Regarding the first scenario (typical clinical and HRCT
features of IPF), it is likely that most clinicians would
agree that an additional diagnostic test is not required.
As occasional patients have uncertain exposures, which
might or might not be relevant to a diagnosis of HP, a
weak negative recommendation for the use of BAL,
reserved for those patients, seems appropriate. However,
even this apparently logical conclusion can be ques￾tioned. In a study by Ohshimo et al., of the diagnostic
significance of a BAL lymphocytosis when the clinical
and HRCT presentation is typical of IPF [10], a BAL lym￾phocytosis of >30% was present in six out of 74 patients
and in all six cases an alternative diagnosis to IPF was
made. The change in diagnostic perception was validated
by surgical biopsy in two cases, and by the subsequent
outcome (which was not typical of IPF) in four cases.
This finding, applying to a handful of patients, needs to
be reproduced in multicenter studies with a larger cohort
of patients before major changes in the recommendation
are considered.
By contrast, when the diagnosis of IPF is “suspected”
and, thus, by definition, uncertain, most European clini￾cians would favour the performance of BAL, with findings
expected to radically alter the likelihood of alternative
diagnoses. This view was endorsed by formal voting in a
large European-wide meeting of clinicians with expertise
in IPF and flies directly in the face of the ATS/ERS/JRS/
ALAT 2011 recommendation. This is likely to reflect the
fact that the ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT recommendation cov￾ered two such dissimilar clinical scenarios with a single
recommendation, although cultural differences between
Europe and the USA in the performance of BAL might
also have played an important role. However, irrespective
of the source of confusion, there is a perceived need for
separate recommendations to address the two distinct
clinical scenarios, as in the British Thoracic Society (BTS)
guidelines on the diagnosis and management of interstitial
lung disease. In the BTS guidelines, the diagnostic use of
BAL was reserved for patients in whom the diagnosis is
uncertain after clinical assessment and HRCT scanning,
with the case by case exclusion of patients with severe dis￾ease or because a biopsy will ultimately be performed [11].
It can be argued that a similar statement is now required
for the specific diagnosis of IPF, with the two key clinical
scenarios clearly distinguished.

* The accuracy of the diagnosis of IPF increases with multidisciplinary discussion (MDD). This is particularly relevant in cases in which the radiologic and
histopathologic patterns are discordant (e.g., HRCT is inconsistent with UIP and histopathology is UIP). There are data to suggest that the accuracy of diagnosis is
improved with MDD among interstitial lung disease experts compared to clinician-specialists in the community setting; timely referral to interstitial lung disease
experts is encouraged.
†Nonclassifiable fibrosis: Some biopsies may reveal a pattern of fibrosis that does not meet the above criteria for UIP pattern and the other idiopathic interstitial
pneumonias. These biopsies may be termed ‘‘nonclassifiable fibrosis.’’
Multidisciplinary discussion should include discussions of the potential for sampling error and a re-evaluation of adequacy of technique of HRCT. NOTE: In cases
with an ‘‘inconsistent with UIP’’ HRCT pattern and a ‘‘UIP’’ surgical lung biopsy pattern, the possibility of a diagnosis of IPF still exists and clarification by MDD
among interstitial lung disease experts is indicated.

Guideline recommendations require expertise
that is not always available
Some radiologists continue to perform sub-optimal CT
scans, using historical thick section protocols (rather than
high resolution CT), a practice that needs to be eradicated
in the diagnostic evaluation of interstitial lung disease. This
issue aside, expert HRCT (and also pathological) interpre￾tation is central to the diagnosis of IPF and requires the
identification of honeycombing. In this regard, there are
two issues of major concern: the distinction between hon￾eycombing and traction bronchiectasis, and the distinction
between honeycombing and the admixture of emphysema
and fibrosis. Both distinctions can be difficult, even for an
experienced observer. The accuracy of a trained observer
in discriminating between ILDs appears to be around
80-90% [12-14]. However, less experienced observers are
substantially less accurate In the Europe-wide IPF meeting
mentioned previously, it was evident, on formal voting,
that a clear majority of clinicians found the HRCT diagno￾sis of IPF to be reliable in less than a third of practicing
radiologists. Furthermore, a substantial majority of clini￾cians stated that IPF was over-diagnosed more often than
it was under-diagnosed. This impression is consistent with
findings in a retrospective review of 39 patients with diffuse
parenchymal lung disease [8] there was significant dis￾agreement in the diagnosis between community and aca￾demic practitioners, with community physicians and
radiologists more likely to over-diagnose IPF.
The under-diagnosis of IPF, albeit a less prevalent pro￾blem, is also important as a confident diagnosis of IPF is
made by HRCT evaluation in, at most, two thirds of IPF
patients [2,15]. In at least one third of cases, IPF cannot be
diagnosed from HRCT appearances. The distinction
between typical and atypical HRCT appearances for a
diagnosis of IPF is a major source of inter-observer varia￾tion among less experienced observers. The 2011 ATS￾ERS recommendations may prove to be a major spur to
better standardisation of radiological expertise by means
of multidisciplinary diagnostic meetings, but do not
directly address the major problem of HRCT misdiagnosis.
Clearly, training in applying guideline recommenda￾tions in the diagnosis of ILD/IPF should be directed not
only to radiologists but also to pathologists and clini￾cians. Inter-obsever variation is a significant problem in
histopathologic diagnosis. Multidisciplinary diagnosis is a
relatively recent phenomenon in interstitial lung disease
and there is a need for clinician training in integrating
and reconciling data to distil a final accurate clinical/radi￾ological/histologic diagnosis.
The integration of observed disease behaviour in
the diagnosis of IPF
The principle of integrating HRCT and histopathologic
data in assigning a diagnostic likelihood of IPF is an
admirable feature of the 2011 ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT state￾ment, which may well be helpful in the majority of cases
and sets an important precedent for future statements.
However, a problem arises in an important subgroup of
patients. Sometimes, HRCT appearances are apparently
incompatible with IPF but the treated disease course is
classical for IPF, with inexorable progression despite ther￾apy. Often, in this setting, a SLB reveals histologic
abnormalities that are absolutely typical of IPF. Using the
schema advanced in the ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT 2011 state￾ment, such patients cannot be diagnosed as having definite
or probable IPF but must be classified as having possible
IPF. This is a deeply unsatisfactory state of affairs. A SLB
is often performed in these cases because the treated
course of disease is typical of IPF [2] and atypical for the
alternative diagnosis suggested by HRCT. Plainly, in such
patients, IPF is, at the very least, a possible diagnosis and,
sometimes, a probable diagnosis, before SLB is performed.
Does the demonstration of a classic UIP pattern on biopsy
really have no impact on the diagnostic likelihood of IPF
in this scenario? Is the diagnosis of IPF truly no more than
a possible diagnosis, once the biopsy findings are inte￾grated? This unhappy conclusion is seriously unhelpful for
patients, relatives and clinicians who see the performance
of SLB as a means of reducing diagnostic uncertainty.
Perhaps patients with HRCT appearances “not compati￾ble” with IPF should not be included in trials of new thera￾pies in IPF, but it would be helpful if the next major
statement on the diagnosis of IPF contains an explicit
acknowledgement that a definite multidisciplinary diagno￾sis of IPF can sometimes be made, based on biopsy find￾ings and a typical treated course, even when the HRCT
features are apparently “incompatible” with a diagnosis of
IPF.
A deficiency common to all guideline statements is the
absence of pragmatic guidance on the level of risk of SLB
in individual patients. A clearer separation between
patients who can undergo a SLB with an acceptably low
risk and those in whom SLB should be avoided would be
helpful to clinicians. The presence of major co-morbidity
is an obvious contraindication to SLB but the level of
severity of IPF associated with a significant increase in
post-operative mortality has not been sufficiently
addressed. It is acknowledged that in the absence of defi￾nitive data, broad statements based on indirect evidence
might be required. However, guidance on this point, even
based solely on expert opinion, would be extremely
useful as a means of facilitating patient participation in
decisions based on “risk-benefit” thinking.
Conclusions
The evidence-based ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT 2011 guideline
recommendations have assisted clinicians in making a
diagnosis and subsequent treatment decisions for the

clinical management of IPF. The guidelines are a major
improvement on the previous statements of the committee
that were published in the early 2000s, with an impressive
review of the literature and a disciplined approach to a
previously undisciplined field. However, in common with
all such statements, guidance mainly focuses on definite
IPF, most often diagnosed from typical HRCT appear￾ances. The definition of probable and possible IPF is also
an advance, but the failure to provide “intention to man￾age” guidance on these highly prevalent clinical scenarios
is a major limitation.
Other aspects of the diagnostic guidelines would merit
review, based on problems that have become increasingly
apparent as recommendations have been applied. The
BAL recommendation has caused confusion due to the
use of a single recommendation to cover two radically dif￾ferent clinical scenarios. The over-diagnosis of IPF on
HRCT appears to be widespread, with urgent work needed
on the standardisation of HRCT diagnosis by expert prac￾titioners. The integration of HRCT and histologic data in
the assigning of diagnostic likelihood is more often helpful
than not, but does not meet the needs of some patients in
whom a multidisciplinary diagnosis of definite IPF should
be made, based on the treated course of disease and typi￾cal biopsy appearances, even when HRCT appearances are
non-diagnostic or suggestive of an alternative diagnosis.
As with any other disease, these issues highlight the con￾tinued need for updating the guidelines, including diag￾nostic and therapeutic aspects, based upon the limitations
that become evident as recommendations are applied.
Pending revision by expert groups, awareness of the
flaws in the current IPF guidelines should alert clinicians
to the need to reject or modify guideline recommenda￾tions in individual patients, provided that these decisions
can be defended at multidisciplinary review.
