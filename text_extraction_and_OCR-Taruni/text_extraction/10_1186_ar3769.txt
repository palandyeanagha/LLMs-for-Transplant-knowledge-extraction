Abstract
Introduction: Increased frequencies of hyperuricemia and gout have been associated with primary
hyperparathyroidism, and recent clinical trials of parathyroid hormone (PTH) have reported hyperuricemic adverse
events. We evaluated the potential population impact of PTH on serum uric acid (SUA) levels by using a nationally
representative sample of United States adults.
Methods: By using data from 8,316 participants aged 18 years and older in the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey 2003 to 2006, we examined the relation between serum PTH and SUA levels with weighted
linear regression. Additionally, we examined the relation with hyperuricemia by using weighted logistic regression.
Results: SUA levels increased with increasing serum PTH concentration. After adjusting for age, sex, dietary factors,
glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and other potentially related biomarkers (calcium, phosphorus, alkaline-phosphatase,
25-hydroxyvitamin D), the SUA level differences from the bottom (referent) to top quintiles of serum PTH levels
were 0, 8, 13, 14, and 19 μM (95% CI, 12 to 26; P for trend, < 0.001). These estimates were larger among renally
impaired individuals (multivariate SUA difference between the extreme quintiles of PTH, 26 versus 15 μM among
those with GFR ≥ 60 versus < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2
, respectively) (P for interaction = 0.004). The odds of
hyperuricemia by various definitions increased with increasing PTH levels as well (multivariate P values for trend, <
0.05).
Conclusions: These nationally representative data indicate that serum PTH levels are independently associated
with serum uric acid levels and the frequency of hyperuricemia at the population level.
Introduction
Hyperuricemia is the precursor of gout, a common and
painful inflammatory arthritis with a growing disease
burden [1]. Hyperuricemia and gout have been long
observed to occur with an increased frequency among
patients with hyperparathyroidism, whereas parathyroi￾dectomy is known to reduce serum uric acid levels in
these cases [2-7]. Elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH)
levels are thought to reduce renal urate excretion,
although the exact mechanism remains unclear [7].
Furthermore, recent randomized controlled trials have
also found that hyperuricemia or gout is associated with
use of teriparatride, a recombinant human PTH
approved for osteoporotic fracture prevention [8-10].
After cessation of teriparatride, serum uric acid levels
decrease [8]. The baseline data of a randomized trial
based on men aged > 40 years [11] and another commu￾nity population study of men aged ≥ 70 years [12]
showed a significant association between PTH and
serum uric acid levels. These data suggest that a signifi￾cant biologic influence of PTH on serum uric acid level
exists, but the impact of this relation at the general
population level (including women) is not known. To
address this issue, we examined the relation between
serum PTH and uric acid levels in a nationally represen￾tative sample of men and women (US National Health
and Nutritional Examination Survey, NHANES 2003 to

Methods
Study population
The NHANES studies are designed to assess the health
and nutritional status of adults and children in the
United States. These studies are based on a representa￾tive sample of the noninstitutionalized US civilian
population that is selected by using a multistage, strati￾fied sampling design. The survey is unique in that it
combines interviews, physical examinations, and var￾ious laboratory data [13]. Beginning in 1999, NHANES
became a continuous survey conducted annually with
data released in 2-year cycles. In this analysis, we used
two recent NHANES datasets that obtained serum
PTH levels, the NHANES 2003-2006. After a home
interview, participants were invited to attend examina￾tion sessions, in which blood and urine specimens
were obtained. Our analysis included participants 18
years or older who attended the medical examination,
and included the 8,316 participants (3,961 men, 4,355
women) with complete information. We repeated our
analysis among 8,272 participants, after excluding par￾ticipants who were taking allopurinol or uricosuric
agents (n = 44).
The NHANES studies underwent institutional review
board approval, and written informed consent was
obtained from participants before starting the study.
Measurements
PTH levels were measured by using the Origen-Electro￾chemiluminescent analysis (Elecsys 1010 Immunoassay
analyzer). The analytic protocols for other serum ana￾lytes and laboratory quality-assurance procedures are
described in the NHANES Laboratory Procedures Man￾uals [14]. Values are reported in picomoles per liter, and
can be converted to picograms per microliter by divid￾ing by 0.1061.
Serum uric acid levels were measured by oxidization
with the specific enzyme uricase to form allantoin and
H2O2 (Beckman Synchron LX20). Details about quality￾control procedures were been published in the
NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manuals [14]. Values
are reported in micromoles per liter and can be con￾verted to milligrams per deciliter by dividing by 59.48.
Assessment of covariates
The NHANES collected information on body measure￾ments (including body mass index (BMI)), medication
use (including diuretics, allopurinol, and uricosuric
agents), medical conditions (including self-reported
hypertension), and relevant laboratory values (serum
creatinine, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, phosphorus,
and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels). Glomerular filtration
rate (GFR) was estimated by using the Modification of
Diet in Renal Disease study equation:
GFR (ml/min per 1.73 min2) = 186×(serum creatinine level (mg/dl))−1.154×(age)
−.203)×(0.0742, if female)×(1.212, if black)
[15-17].
The average daily intakes of energy, protein, carbohy￾drates, sugar, fat, caffeine, and alcohol were derived
from a mean of two 24-hour dietary recalls conducted
two separate days after the medical examination.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were computed by using survey
commands of STATA (for example, SVYMEAN and
SVYREG) to incorporate sample weights and to adjust
for clusters and strata of the complex sample design
(STATA Corporation, College Station, TX, USA).
We used linear regression modeling to evaluate the
relation between PTH levels and serum uric acid levels.
PTH levels were categorized into quintiles, and each
quintile was compared with the lowest quintile. Multi￾variate models were adjusted for: age, sex, race, BMI,
self-reported hypertension, use of diuretics, use of allo￾purinol or uricosuric agents, GFR, intake of alcohol, total
energy, protein, and sugar, and mutually for serum levels
of PTH, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, phosphorus, and
vitamin D. To help address the potential influence of
central adiposity (reflecting insulin resistance), we con￾ducted analyses with adjustment for waist circumference
in addition to, as well as in place of, BMI. Trends in
serum uric acid levels across PTH categories were
assessed in linear regression models by using continuous
PTH values. We performed logistic regression with a
dichotomous outcome of hyperuricemia (serum uric acid
level > 7.0 mg/dl in men and > 5.7 mg/dl in women [18]),
adjusting for the same covariates. We also examined the
potential impact of alternative definitions of hyperurice￾mia (serum uric acid level > 6.0 mg/dl and > 7.0 mg/dl,
both regardless of sex) in these regression models.
We examined whether the observed associations per￾sisted within the subgroups stratified by sex, BMI (< 25
kg/m2 versus ≥ 25 kg/m2
), GFR (≥ 60 versus < 60 ml/
min per 1.73 m2
), serum vitamin D levels (≥ 52.4 nM
(median value) versus < 52.4 nM), and serum calcium
levels (≥ 2.4 mM (median value) versus < 2.4 mM). We
determined the statistical significance of potential sub￾group effects by testing the significance of interaction
terms added to our final multivariate models. For all dif￾ference estimates and odd ratios, we calculated 95%
confidence intervals (CIs). All P values are two-sided.
Results
The mean age of the population was 46 years. The mean
serum uric acid level was 319.05 μM (361 μM among
men and 280 μM among women), and 19.13% were
hyperuricemic (20.86% among men and 17.54% among

women). The characteristics of the study according to
PTH level are shown in Table 1. With increasing PTH
levels, age, BMI, serum levels of alkaline phosphatase,
use of diuretics and urate-lowering agents, and the fre￾quency of hypertension and diabetes tended to increase,
whereas GFR, the proportion of whites, and serum levels
of calcium, vitamin D, and phosphorus tended to
decrease. Furthermore, intake of total energy, carbohy￾drates, protein, sugar, fat, and caffeine tended to
decrease with increasing PTH levels.
After adjusting for age and sex, serum uric acid levels
among individuals in the highest quintile were higher
than those in the lowest quintile by 36 μM (95% CI, 28
to 44; P for trend, < 0.001). After adjusting for other
covariates, the difference was attenuated to 19 μM (95%
CI, 12 to 26; P for trend < 0.001), but remained signifi￾cant (Table 2). When we repeated our analyses after
excluding participants who were taking allopurinol or
uricosuric agents (n = 44), the results did not signifi￾cantly change. When we repeated our multivariate ana￾lyses with adjustment for waist circumference,
additionally or in place of BMI, our results did not
change materially (P values for trend < 0.001).
When hyperuricemia was examined as a dichotomous
outcome, the relations were similar (Table 3). For exam￾ple, the multivariate odds ratios (ORs) for hyperuricemia
according to increasing quintiles of serum PTH level
were 1, 1.07, 1.22, 1.36, and 1.39 (95% CI, 1.03 to 1.88;
P for trend = 0.03). Alternative definitions of hyperuri￾cemia (serum uric acid levels > 6.0 mg/dl and > 7.0 mg/
dl, both regardless of sex) did not materially alter these
results (P values for trend < 0.03).
Additionally, when we stratified our multivariate ana￾lysis by subgroups of BMI, GFR, serum vitamin D levels,
and serum calcium levels, the association between PTH
and serum uric acid levels persisted in all subgroups (P
values for trend ≤ 0.007). The association did not vary
significantly by these subgroups (P values for interaction
> 0.55) except for GFR subgroups. Serum uric acid
levels in individuals of the highest quintile of PTH were
higher than in the lowest quintile by 26 μM (P for trend
< 0.001) in the lower GFR group, whereas the corre￾sponding difference was 15 μM (P for trend = 0.007) in
the higher GFR group (P for interaction = 0.004).
Discussion
In our nationally representative population study of US
men and women, we found that serum uric acid levels
and the frequency of hyperuricemia increased with
increasing PTH levels in a graded manner. These asso￾ciations were independent of other risk factors for
hyperuricemia, such as age, sex, BMI, waist circumfer￾ence, dietary risk factors, alcohol intake, renal function,
hypertension, diuretic use, and serum levels of calcium
and vitamin D. The association persisted across sub￾groups of BMI, serum levels of calcium, and vitamin D,
and was greater in the lower GFR group. These findings
provide evidence that supports an independent link
between serum PTH and uric acid levels at the national
population level.
The mean difference in serum uric acid level between
the extreme quintiles of PTH was 19 μM (0.31 mg/dl),
whereas the difference among individuals with chronic
kidney disease (stage 2 or higher) was 26 μM (0.43 mg/
dl). These levels of adjusted population mean differences
were comparable to difference estimates between the
extreme quintiles of intakes of total meats or seafood
(0.11 mg/dl versus 0.10 mg/dl) in another NHANES
study [19], which can be translated into a significant
risk for incident gout, as demonstrated in a prospective
analysis of the Health Professionals Follow-up Study
[20]. This potential impact on the eventual risk of gout
was also supported by our results with various defini￾tions of hyperuricemia as a dichotomous outcome.
The link between PTH, hyperuricemia, and gout was
observed in primary hyperparathyroidism [2-7]. For
example, in an NIH case series, 20 of 56 patients (not
taking diuretics) had serum uric acid levels > 7 mg/dl

[3]. After parathyroidectomy, serum uric acid levels
decreased by more than 1 mg/dl in 64% of these
patients [3]. Limited studies have suggested that reduced
renal excretion is responsible for the link, but the
detailed underlying process remains unknown [7].
Recently, notable advances were made in the physiol￾ogy of proximal tubular urate transport, with the identi￾fication of multiple secretory and absorptive
transporters at both the basolateral and apical mem￾branes [21-24]; urate transport across the proximal
tubule is the net sum of these two processes. PTH
would be expected to have more-negative effects on net
proximal tubular urate reabsorption, given that proximal
tubular salt (Na+
-Cl-
) and urate transport are regulated
in parallel [25] and that PTH is a potent inhibitor of
NHE3 [26], a critical apical transporter for proximal
tubular salt absorption.
Recent osteoporosis prevention trials of teriparatride
as a bone-formation stimulant have also reported hyper￾uricemia as an adverse event. For example, a clinical
trial of 1,637 postmenopausal women found that teripar￾atride increases the incidence of hyperuricemia in a
dose-response fashion, up to 25% at a dose of 40 μg per
day [8,9]. After cessation of treatment, serum uric acid
levels returned to or approached pretreatment levels [8].
However, a randomized trial of men 40 years or older
suggested that reducing PTH levels by calcium supple￾mentation may not affect serum uric acid levels [11].
Interestingly, the hyperuricemia adverse events in the
teriparatride trial [8,9] were substantially more frequent
among renally impaired patients, which was the case in
the current population data. These data suggest that
renal impairment or its associated processes significantly
influence the hyperuricemic effects of PTH, calling for
future investigations to elucidate the underlying
mechanisms. Furthermore, this raises an intriguing
question of whether vitamin D supplementation in ren￾ally impaired patients could help to reduce their serum
uric acid levels. Another clinical trial of 428 glucocorti￾coid-treated adults reported both hyperuricemia (n = 3)
and gout (n = 1) as adverse events of teriparatride, 20
μg per day [10]. Our findings expand these randomized
trial data from a specific disease population to a general
population level [2-10].
Strengths and limitations of our study deserve com￾ment. This study was performed in a nationally repre￾sentative sample of US men and women; thus the
findings are likely to be generalizable to the US adult
population. Although our cross-sectional study alone
would leave uncertainty regarding the temporal
sequence of exposure-outcome relations and thus about
a potential causal link, the aforementioned randomized
trial data with dose-response relation and reduction of
uric acid levels after cessation of exposure (that is, teri￾paratride) or after parathyroidectomy in primary hyper￾parathyroidism, collectively provide a strong causal
argument. Thus, our study findings should be viewed as
expanding the generalizability of these previous findings
to the general population.
Regardless, confirming the relation in a prospective
longitudinal observational context (for example, the rela￾tion between prior PTH levels and incident gout, parti￾cularly in a renally impaired group) would be valuable.
Conclusions
These nationally representative data indicate that serum
PTH levels are independently associated with serum
uric acid levels and the frequency of hyperuricemia at
the general population level. These data provide support
for future studies aimed to clarify the underlying mole￾cular mechanisms.
