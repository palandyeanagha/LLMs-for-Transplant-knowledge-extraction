Abstract. The heart is abundantly innervated, and the nervous system precisely controls the
function of this organ. The density of cardiac innervation is altered in diseased hearts, which
can lead to unbalanced neural activation and lethal arrhythmia. For example, diabetic sensory
neuropathy causes silent myocardial ischemia, characterized by loss of pain perception during
myocardial ischemia, and it is a major cause of sudden cardiac death in diabetes mellitus. Despite
the clinical importance of cardiac innervation, the mechanisms underlying the control of this
process remain poorly understood. We demonstrate that cardiac innervation is determined by the
balance between neural chemoattractants and chemorepellents within the heart. Nerve growth
factor (NGF), a potent chemoattractant, is synthesized abundantly by cardiomyocytes, and is
induced by the upregulation of endothelin-1 during development. By comparison, the neural
chemorepellent Sema3a is expressed at high levels in the subendocardium in the early stage of
embryogenesis and is downregulated as development progresses, leading to epicardial-to￾endocardial transmural sympathetic innervation patterning. We also show that the downregula￾tion of cardiac NGF is a cause of diabetic neuropathy and that NGF supplementation prevents
silent myocardial ischemia in diabetes mellitus. Both Sema3a-targeted and Sema3a￾overexpressing mice display sudden cardiac death or lethal arrhythmias due to disruption of
innervation patterning. The present review focuses on the regulatory mechanisms controlling
cardiac innervation and the critical roles of these processes in cardiac performance.

Introduction
Cardiac tissues are extensively innervated by auto￾nomic nerves. The sympathetic nervous system produces
norepinephrine and increases the heart rate, conduction
velocity, as well as myocardial contraction and relax￾ation. It is well known that sympathetic innervation
density, which is high in the subepicardium and the
central conduction, is stringently regulated in the heart
(1). Regional differences in sympathetic innervation
correspond to different areas of influence over cardiac
function to effectively control heart rate and myocardial
contraction and relaxation. Despite the clinical impor￾tance of cardiac innervation, little is known about the
developmental and regulatory mechanisms underlying
cardiac sympathetic innervation patterning. Moreover,
to date there has been no experimental demonstration of
the consequences of disrupting this patterning.
The density of cardiac innervation is altered in
diseased hearts, as in cases of congestive heart failure
and myocardial infarction. Following myocardial injury,
cardiac nerves undergo Wallerian degeneration, which
may be followed by neurilemmal cell proliferation and
axonal regeneration, resulting in heterogeneous innerva-

Cardiac Innervation and Sudden Cardiac Death 349
tion. Unbalanced sympathetic innervation may trigger
lethal arrhythmia through ion channel modulation in
cardiomyocytes (2). Also of clinical concern is the
development of cardiac sensory denervation in diabetes
mellitus (DM) patients. As the sensory nervous system
is responsible for pain perception, cardiac sensory dener￾vation can lead to diabetic sensory neuropathy and silent
myocardial ischemia. This condition is characterized by
loss of pain perception during myocardial ischemia and
frequently leads to sudden cardiac death (SCD) in DM
patients. Despite the severity of these complications,
the molecular mechanisms underlying the control of
innervation density in pathological hearts are poorly
understood. Addressing these questions requires a better
understanding of the anatomical distribution of cardiac
nerves and the molecular mechanisms regulating inner￾vation during development.
In this article, we review the regulatory mechanisms
involved in neural development in the heart and also
discuss the critical role of innervation patterning in
cardiac performance.
Cardiac nerve development
Neural crest cells migrate and form sympathetic
ganglia by mid-gestation and subsequently proliferate
and differentiate into mature neurons (3). The cardiac
sympathetic nerves extend from the sympathetic neurons
in stellate ganglia, which are located bilateral to the
vertebra. Sympathetic nerve fibers project from the base
of the heart into the myocardium and are located
predominantly in the subepicardium of the ventricle.
The central conduction system, which includes the
sinoatrial node, atrioventricular node, and His bundle,
is abundantly innervated compared with the working
myocardium. We and others have reported that this
regional difference in cardiac sympathetic innervation
(innervation patterning) is highly conserved among
mammals.
The cardiac nervous system also involves afferent
nerves. The sensory signals generated in the heart are
conducted through cardiac afferent nerves, primarily
thinly myelinated Aδ-fibers and nonmyelinated C-fibers.
The sensory nerve fibers project to the upper thoracic
dorsal horn via dorsal root ganglia neurons, which are
also derived from neural crest cells.
A major challenge to analysis of cardiac innervation
of the heart has been the lack of suitable molecular
markers. Recent advances in immunohistochemical
technology now allow autonomic nerves to be stained
using antibodies against nerve-specific markers, such
as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a sympathetic marker;
calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a sensory
marker; protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5), a general
peripheral nerve marker; and growth-associated protein
43 (GAP43), a nerve sprouting marker. As discussed
below, we and others have used these specific neural
markers to demonstrate that the organization of cardiac
innervation is strictly controlled in the heart during
development, whereas in diseased hearts, innervation
density and organization are dramatically altered.
Nerve sprouting and SCD
Sympathetic stimulation is important in the generation
of SCD in diseased hearts. There is circadian variation
in the frequency of SCD that parallels sympathetic nerve
activity. β-Blocker therapy prevents SCD secondary to
ventricular tachyarrhythmia in ischemic heart disease or
congestive heart failure. Immunohistochemical analysis
of cardiac nerves in explanted hearts of transplant
recipients reveals a positive correlation between nerve
density and clinical history of ventricular tachyarrhythmia
(4). Zhou et al. showed that nerve growth factor (NGF),
which is critical for sympathetic nerve sprouting, is
upregulated after myocardial infarction (MI) in animal
models, resulting in the regeneration of cardiac sympa￾thetic nerves and heterogeneous innervation (5). In other
experiments, augmented myocardial nerve sprouting
through NGF infusion after MI results in a dramatic
increase in SCD and a high incidence of ventricular
tachyarrhythmia, compared with animals not receiving
NGF infusion (6). These results demonstrate that NGF
upregulation and nerve sprouting in diseased hearts may
cause lethal arrhythmia and SCD. However, the mole￾cular mechanisms that regulate NGF expression and
sympathetic innervation in the heart are poorly under￾stood.
The endothelin-1 (ET-1) / NGF pathway is critical
for cardiac sympathetic innervation
In general, the growth-cone behavior of nerves is
modulated by coincident signaling modulated by neural
chemoattractants and chemorepellents synthesized in the
innervated tissue. NGF, a potent neural chemoattractant,
is a prototypic member of the neurotrophin family
that plays critical roles in the differentiation, survival,
and synaptic activity of the peripheral sympathetic and
sensory nervous systems (7). The level of NGF expres￾sion within innervated tissue corresponds approximately
to innervation density. NGF expression increases during
development and is altered in diseased hearts.
ET-1 is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of cardiac
hypertrophy, hypertension, and atherosclerosis. Gene
targeting of ET-1 and its receptor ETA results in un-

350 M Ieda and K Fukuda
expected craniofacial and cardiovascular abnormalities
not observed in other hypertrophic factor–deficient mice
(8). Although these phenotypes are consistent with
interference of neural crest differentiation, the role of
ET-1 in neural crest development remains undetermined.
We hypothesized that ET-1 affects the induction of
neurotrophic factors and that the disruption of ET-1
contributes to the immature development of neural
crest–derived cells.
We found that ET-1, but not angiotensin II, phenyle￾phrine, leukemia inhibitory factor, or IGF-1, upregulates
NGF expression in primary cultured cardiomyocytes (9).
ET-1–induced NGF augmentation is not observed in
cardiac fibroblasts and is specific to cardiomyocytes.
ET-1–induced NGF augmentation is mediated via the
ETA receptor, Giβγ, PKC, the Src family, EGFR, extra￾cellular signal-regulated kinase, p38MAPK, activator
protein-1, and the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein δ
element. To study the role of the ET-1/NGF pathway in
the development of the cardiac sympathetic nervous
system, we analyzed various mouse models of modified
genes. NGF expression, cardiac sympathetic innerva￾tion, and norepinephrine concentration are reduced in
ET-1–deficient mouse (Edn1−/−
) hearts, but not in the
hearts of angiotensinogen-deficient mice (Atg−/−
). In
Edn1−/−
 mice, the sympathetic stellate ganglia exhibited
excessive apoptosis and display loss of neurons at the
late embryonic stage. Moreover, we demonstrate that
cardiac-specific overexpression of NGF in Edn1−/−
 mice
rescues the heart from sympathetic nerve retardation.
These findings indicate that ET-1 is a key regulator of
NGF expression in cardiomyocytes and that the ET-1
/NGF pathway is critical for sympathetic innervation
in the heart. Given that ET-1 is strongly induced in
pathological conditions, the ET-1/NGF pathway may
also be involved in NGF upregulation and nerve
regeneration after myocardial infarction.
NGF is critical for cardiac sensory innervation and
rescues the diabetic heart from neuropathy
The cardiac autonomic nervous system is composed
of efferent and afferent nerves. The cardiac sensory
nervous system is responsible for pain perception and
for initiating a protective cardiovascular response during
myocardial ischemia. Cardiac sensory nerve impairment
causes silent myocardial ischemia, which is a major
cause of sudden death in DM patients. Despite the
severity of this complication, the alterations in cardiac
sensory innervation in diabetic sensory neuropathy and
the molecular mechanism underlying this process are
poorly understood. Moreover, little is known about the
anatomical distribution of cardiac sensory nerves and the
molecular mechanism controlling innervation during
development.
Unlike somatic tissues, visceral organs, such as the
heart, are believed to be rich in autonomic efferent
innervation but poor in nociceptive afferent nerves. In
fact, Zahner et al. report that vanilloid receptor-1–
immunopositive sensory nerves are enriched in the
epicardium but scarce in the myocardium (10). We
show that cardiac sensory innervation is rich not only at
epicardial sites but also in the ventricular myocardium
and that sensory innervation increases with development
(11). In a screen of several neurotrophic factors, we
showed that development of cardiac sensory nerves
coincides with synthesis of NGF in the heart. Cardiac
nociceptive sensory nerves that are immunopositive for
CGRP, including the dorsal root ganglia and the dorsal
horn, are markedly retarded in NGF-deficient mice,
while cardiac-specific overexpression of NGF rescues
the heart from these deficits. Thus, NGF synthesis in
the heart is critical for the development of the cardiac
sensory nervous system.
To investigate whether NGF is involved in diabetic
neuropathy, DM was induced with streptozotocin in
wild-type (WT) and transgenic mice overexpressing
NGF in the heart. DM-induced WT mice show down￾regulation of NGF, CGRP-immunopositive cardiac
sensory denervation, and atrophic changes in dorsal root
ganglia, whereas these defects are prevented in DM￾induced NGF-transgenic mice. Cardiac sensory func￾tion, as measured by myocardial ischemia-induced c-Fos
expression in dorsal root ganglia, is also downregulated
by DM in WT mice, but not by DM in NGF-transgenic
mice. Direct gene transfer of NGF into diabetic rat hearts
improves the impaired cardiac sensory innervation and
function, as determined by the electrophysiological
activity of cardiac afferent nerves during myocardial
ischemia. These findings demonstrate that development
of the cardiac sensory nervous system depends on the
synthesis of NGF in the heart, and that DM-induced
suppression of NGF expression may lead to cardiac
sensory neuropathy.
Phase I and phase II clinical trials showed that
systemic administration of recombinant NGF is safe and
has potential efficacy in diabetic polyneuropathy, but a
phase III trial did not show any beneficial effects,
perhaps because the dosage and route of administration
were suboptimal (12, 13). The dosage of NGF was
restricted by side-effects in the phase III clinical trial,
and the development of anti-NGF antibodies may have
contributed to the lack of beneficial effects. We
examined the possibility of avoiding these complications
by direct administration of the NGF gene to the cells
that require the factor. We showed that NGF expression

Cardiac Innervation and Sudden Cardiac Death 351
and CGRP-immunopositive nerves are proportionally
reduced in diabetic hearts and thus demonstrated the
successful treatment of cardiac sensory neuropathy by
direct NGF gene transfer. Consistent with our findings,
the efficacy of NGF gene therapy has been reported in
diabetic cystopathy and neuropathy of the footpad (14).
Further studies on the reliability and efficacy of NGF
gene therapy are required before clinical trials can pro￾ceed.
Sema3a is critical for cardiac sympathetic innerva￾tion patterning
As discussed above, NGF plays critical roles in cardiac
nerve development. In contrast, the neural chemorepel￾lent that induces growth-cone collapse and repels nerve
axons has not been identified in the heart. The Class 3
secreted semaphorin, Sema3a, has been cloned and
identified as a potent neural chemorepellent and a direc￾tional guidance molecule for nerve fibers (15 – 17).
However, it is not known whether cardiomyocytes
produce Sema3a, and if so, whether this protein affects
sympathetic neural patterning and cardiac performance.
We analyzed the kinetics and distribution of cardiac
sympathetic innervation in developing murine ventricles
(1). TH-immunopositive sympathetic nerve endings
appear on the epicardial surface at embryonic day (E)15
and gradually increase in number in the myocardium
after postnatal day (P)7 and P42. In the ventricular
myocardium, sympathetic nerves are more abundant
in the subepicardium than in the subendocardium,
suggesting an epicardial-to-endocardial gradient. We
analyzed heterozygous Sema3a knocked-in lacZ mice
(Sema3alacZ/+) to identify the Sema3a expression pattern
and its relationship to innervation patterning in the heart.
At E12, lacZ expression was detected strongly in the
heart, especially in the trabecular components of the
ventricles. In E15 hearts, lacZ expression was observed
in the subendocardium but not in the subepicardium of
the atria and ventricles (Fig. 1). At P1 and P42, lacZ
expression was reduced in certain regions and high￾lighted the Purkinje fiber network along the ventricular
free wall. Quantitative RT-PCR of Sema3a in developing

Fig. 2. Regulation of cardiac innervation pattern￾ing. a: Cardiac sympathetic innervation shows an
epicardial-to-endocardial transmural gradient. This
patterning is established by the balance between
ET-1/NGF and Sema3a expression in the heart. Note
that NGF is expressed abundantly in the working
myocardium, whereas Sema3a is expressed specifi￾cally in the subendocardium. b: Appropriate Sema3a￾mediated sympathetic innervation patterning is
critical for the maintenance of an arrhythmia-free
heart. Sema3a−/−
 mice exhibit sinus bradycardia, and
SemaTG mice are highly susceptible to ventricular
tachyarrhythmias.

352 M Ieda and K Fukuda
hearts confirmed the presence of Sema3a from E12 and
the subsequent linear decrease in expression. The spatial
and temporal expression pattern of Sema3a contrasts
directly with the patterning of sympathetic innervation
in developing hearts. These results indicate that Sema3a
is a negative regulator of cardiac innervation.
We analyzed Sema3a-deficient mice (Sema3a−/−
)
to investigate whether Sema3a is critical for cardiac
sympathetic nerve development. The WT hearts show a
clear epicardial-to-endocardial gradient of sympathetic
innervation. In contrast, the sympathetic nerve density is
lower in the subepicardium and higher in the sub￾endocardium of Sema3a−/−
 mice, resulting in disruption
of the innervation gradient in Sema3a−/−
 ventricles. The
Sema3a−/−
 mice also exhibit malformation of the stellate
ganglia that extend sympathetic nerves to the heart. To
investigate whether the abnormal sympathetic innerva￾tion patterning in Sema3a−/−
 hearts is a secondary effect
of stellate ganglia malformation, we generated transgenic
mice overexpressing Sema3a specifically in the heart
(SemaTG). SemaTG mice are associated with reduced
sympathetic innervation and attenuation of the epicardial￾to-endocardial innervation gradient. These results indi￾cate that cardiomyocyte-derived Sema3a plays critical
roles in cardiac sympathetic innervation by inhibiting
neural growth. Since cardiomyocyte-derived NGF acts
as a chemoattractant, it is possible that the balance
between NGF and Sema3a synthesized in the heart
determines cardiac sympathetic innervation patterning.
The growth-cone behavior of somatic sensory axons
is also modulated by the coincident signaling of NGF
and Sema3a (18, 19). During development, NGF and
Sema3a are expressed within the spinal cord and
influence the guidance pathway of sensory axons.
Sema3a is specifically expressed in the ventral half of
the spinal cord and mediates the termination of NGF￾responsive sensory axons at the dorsal part of the spinal
cord. The targeted inactivation of Sema3a disrupts
neural patterning and projections in the spinal cord,
thereby highlighting the critical role of Sema3a signal￾ing in the directional guidance of nerve fibers (17, 20).
Sema3a maintains arrhythmia-free hearts through
sympathetic innervation patterning
Most Sema3a−/− mice die within the first postnatal
week, with only 20% surviving until weaning. We
performed telemetric electrocardiography and heart-rate
variability analysis to identify the cause of death and the
effects of abnormal sympathetic neural distribution in
Sema3a−/−
 hearts (1). In addition to multiple premature
ventricular contractions, Sema3a−/−
 mice develop sinus
bradycardia and abrupt sinus arrest due to sympathetic
neural dysfunction.
By comparison, the SemaTG mice die suddenly at 10
months of age without symptoms. Sustained ventricular
tachyarrhythmia is induced in SemaTG mice, but not in
WT mice, after epinephrine administration, and pro￾grammed electrical stimulation reveals that SemaTG mice
are highly susceptible to ventricular tachyarrhythmia.
The β1-adrenergic receptor density is upregulated and
the cAMP response after catecholamine injection is
exaggerated in SemaTG ventricles. Action potential
duration is significantly prolonged in hypoinnervated
SemaTG ventricles, presumably via ion channel modula￾tion. These results suggest that the higher susceptibility
of SemaTG mice to ventricular arrhythmia is due, at least
in part, to catecholamine supersensitivity and prolonged
action potential duration, both of which can augment
triggered activity in cardiomyocytes. Thus, Sema3a￾mediated sympathetic innervation patterning is critical
for the maintenance of arrhythmia-free hearts.
Sympathetic nerves modulate the function of ion
channels and trigger various arrhythmias in diseased
hearts (21, 22). Various studies highlight the importance
of regulatory factors in sympathetic innervation
patterning. For example, Sema3a−/− mice exhibit sinus
bradycardia, abrupt sinus slowing, and stellate ganglia
defects. Consistent with our data, right stellectomy
induces sinus bradycardia and sudden, asystolic death in
dogs (23). In addition, Stramba-Badiale et al. report that
developmental abnormalities in cardiac innervation may
play a role in the genesis of some cases of sudden infant
death syndrome (24). The SemaTG hearts are also highly
susceptible to ventricular arrhythmias, albeit without
contractile dysfunction or structural defects. Given
that catecholamine augments systolic function, it is
surprising that SemaTG mice show normal cardiac
function. Patients with denervated hearts who undergo
heart transplantation do not develop heart failure but
approximately 10% of the patients develop SCD (25).
Together, these studies highlight the significance of
cardiac nerve regulation as a new paradigm for the
management of SCD.
Conclusions
Cardiac nerves are highly plastic, and innervation
patterning is strictly controlled by the balance between
NGF and Sema3a synthesized in the heart (Fig. 2a).
ET-1 regulates NGF expression in cardiomyocytes, and
the ET-1/NGF pathway modulates nerve sprouting and
plays critical roles in sympathetic nerve development.
NGF is also important in sensory nerve development,
and NGF downregulation may result in sensory neuro￾pathy in diabetic hearts. By comparison, Sema3a inhibits

Cardiac Innervation and Sudden Cardiac Death 353
neural growth and establishes appropriate innervation
patterning in the heart. The disruption of sympathetic
innervation patterning may lead to SCD, in both
diseased and developing hearts (Fig. 2b). An under￾standing of the mechanisms regulating cardiac innerva￾tion patterning in hearts represents an important step
towards the development of therapies for SCD.
