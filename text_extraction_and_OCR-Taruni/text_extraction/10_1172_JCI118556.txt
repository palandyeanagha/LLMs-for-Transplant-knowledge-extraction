Abstract
Lipoproteins can bind lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and de￾crease the LPS-stimulated production of pro-inflammatory
cytokines. We investigated the effect of increased plasma
concentrations of low-density-lipoproteins (LDL) on sur￾vival and cytokine production after a lethal challenge with
either LPS or live Gram-negative bacteria in LDL receptor
deficient mice (LDLR2/2). The LDLR2/2 mice chal￾lenged with LPS had an eightfold increased LD50 when
compared with the wild type controls (C57Bl/6J), while tu￾mor necrosis factor a (TNFa) and interleukin-1 a (IL-1a)
plasma concentrations were decreased twofold. LDLR2/2
mice had significantly lower and delayed mortality than
control mice after infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae. No
differences in the outgrowth of bacteria in the organs were
present between the two groups, while circulating cytokine
concentrations were decreased twofold in LDLR2/2 mice.
In contrast, the LPS-stimulated in vitro production of cyto￾kines by peritoneal macrophages of LDLR2/2 mice was
significantly increased compared with controls. This in￾crease was associated with enhanced specific binding of
LPS to the macrophages of LDLR2/2 mice. In conclusion,
endogenous LDL can protect against the lethal effects of en￾dotoxin and Gram-negative infection. At least part of this
protection is achieved through decreased in vivo production
of pro-inflammatory cytokines, in spite of increased cyto￾kine production capacity. (J. Clin. Invest. 1996. 97:1366–
1372). Key words: lipopolysaccharide • gram-negative infec￾tion • tumor necrosis factor • interleukin-1 • low-density li￾poproteins.
Introduction
Mammals infected with Gram-negative bacteria may develop
a severe syndrome characterized by hypotension, disseminated
intravascular coagulation, and renal, hepatic and cerebral
damage. Most of these deleterious effects can be mimicked by
infusion of endotoxin, a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) component
of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria (1). Binding of LPS
to various receptors on leukocytes triggers the production and
release of proinflammatory cytokines as tumor necrosis factor
a (TNFa), interleukin-1a (IL-1a) and IL-1b. In experimental
models, treatment of animals with anti-TNF antibodies attenu￾ates the lethal effects of endotoxin or Gram-negative bacteria
(2, 3). A protective effect can also be obtained by treatment
with either of the natural antagonists of TNF or IL-1, soluble
TNF receptors or IL-1 receptor antagonist (4, 5). Thus, these
cytokines are thought to play a central role in the pathophysi￾ology of sepsis.
Once LPS enters the circulation, initial interactions with
LPS-binding protein (LBP) and lipoproteins play a critical role
in subsequent stimulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine syn￾thesis. The LPS-LBP complex is bound by CD14, the cellular
receptor for LBP, and this binding stimulates macrophages to
release pro-inflammatory cytokines (6, 7). Recent studies also
suggest that LBP may facilitate the binding of LPS not only to
CD14, but also to lipoproteins (8), either by direct action of
LBP or by a two-step reaction in which LPS is first transferred
to sCD14 and subsequently to HDL (9). In plasma, LPS bind
to the various types of lipoproteins: high-density lipoproteins
(HDL) (10), low-density lipoproteins (LDL) (11), very-low￾density lipoproteins (VLDL) (12) and chylomicrons (13). For￾mation of LPS-lipoproteins complexes greatly reduces the
binding of LPS to macrophages (14, 15). In vitro, this results in
decreased production and release of the pro-inflammatory cy￾tokines TNF, IL-1 and IL-6 (16, 17), and a subsequent loss of
LPS toxicity.
The potential protective effect of lipoproteins against LPS￾toxicity in vivo has been investigated in recent studies. Prein￾cubation of LPS with lipoproteins prior to injection into ani￾mals decreased the mortality (10), while the in vivo infusion of
lipoproteins markedly reduced the cytokinemia and mortality
after LPS administration (18). Transgenic mice that express
human apolipoprotein A-1 at high levels and thus have ele￾vated plasma HDL concentrations are protected against LPS
challenge (19). In contrast, hypolipidemic mice are more sensi￾tive to the toxic effects of endotoxin (20).
All these studies have shown a protection by lipoproteins
against LPS effects, while only one recent study has reported
that hyperlipoproteinemia may beneficially influence severe
infections with live microorganisms (21). In a rat model of ce￾cal ligation and puncture, infusion of exogenous chylomicrons
reduced both circulating LPS and TNF concentrations and
mortality. However, no data regarding the effect of endoge￾nously elevated lipoprotein concentrations on severe infec￾tions have been reported. In the present study, we assessed the
effects of a lethal LPS challenge and a lethal Gram-negative
infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae in the recently developed

Lipoproteins Protect Against Gram-negative Infections 1367
low density lipoprotein receptor knockout mice (LDLR2/2).
These LDLR2/2 mice have a markedly increased plasma
cholesterol concentration compared with the wild-type con￾trols, due to a 7–9-fold increase in intermediate density lipo￾proteins (IDL) and LDL (22). To study the mechanisms in￾volved in the lipoprotein-induced protection we assessed the
bacterial outgrowth in the organs and the cytokine response
during infection. In addition, we studied the cytokine produc￾tion capacity by the peritoneal macrophages of the LDLR2/2
and control mice.
Methods
Animals. Homozygous C57Bl/6J mice lacking low density lipopro￾tein receptors (LDLR2/2) and wild-type littermates were obtained
from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) as mating pairs, and
bred in our local facility. For the experiments, 6–8 weeks old mice,
weighing 20–25 grams, were used. The animals were fed standard lab￾oratory chow (Hope Farms, Woerden, the Netherlands) and housed
under specific pathogen-free conditions. The experiments were ap￾proved by the ethical committee on animal experiments of the Catho￾lic University Nijmegen.
Lethal endotoxemia model. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Escheri￾chia coli serotype O55:B5) was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co.
(St. Louis, MO). Groups of LDLR2/2 and C57Bl/6J mice were in￾jected i.v. in the retroorbital plexus (after anesthetizing with ether)
with various amounts of LPS (0.25–2.5 mg/mouse). 90 min after chal￾lenge with LPS, five animals from each group were anesthetized with
ether and bled from the retroorbital plexus for measurement of
TNFa circulating concentrations. Another five animals per group
were bled 4 h after LPS for measurement of IL-1a and IL-1b circulat￾ing concentrations. In the remaining mice (at least 5 animals/group),
survival was assessed daily for 7 d.
Lethal cytokinemia model. To investigate the role of TNF and
IL-1 in the LPS-induced mortality, LDLR2/2 and control mice re￾ceived a single i.v. injection of recombinant human TNFa (50 mg/
mouse) (kindly provided by Dr. G. Adolf, Ernst-Boehringer Institut,
Vienna, Austria), recombinant human IL-1a (10 mg/mouse) (kindly
provided by Dr. P. Lomedico, Hoffmann-LaRoche, Nutley, NJ), or a
combination of both. Several combinations of recombinant cytokines
were used in different experiments: 10 mg TNFa with 1 mg IL-1a, 20
mg TNFa with 5 mg IL-1a, and 50 mg TNFa with 20 mg of IL-1a. Sur￾vival was assessed every 12 h for 2 d.
Klebsiella pneumoniae infection. Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC
43816), a strain that produces a lethal infection in normal mice, was
injected i.v. in the retroorbital plexus (106–107
 CFU/mouse) into
LDLR2/2 and control mice (LD50 8 3 105
 CFU/C57Bl/6J mouse).
To assess whether the same protection is obtained in a more sus￾tained model of infection, K. pneumoniae 106
 CFU/mouse was in￾jected intramuscularly (i.m.) (LD50 5 3 105
 CFU/C57Bl/6J mouse)
into the left thigh muscle of the animals as described (23). Survival
was assessed daily for 14 d, in groups of at least 18 (i.v. infection) or 9
animals (i.m. infection). The surviving animals were sacrificed on day
28 of infection. After 90 min and 4 h, subgroups of five mice were
killed and blood was collected from retroorbital plexus for the mea￾surement of cytokine concentrations. The outgrowth of the microor￾ganisms from the blood, liver, spleen and kidneys of the animals was
quantified 24 h after the injection of K. pneumoniae. The organs were
removed aseptically, weighed, and homogenized in sterile saline in a
tissue grinder. Serial dilutions of the homogenized tissues or blood
(0.1 ml) were plated on sheep blood agar, and CFU were counted af￾ter overnight incubation at 378C.
To determine the circulating LPS concentrations, in a separate set
of experiments groups of 10 LDLR2/2 and control mice were in￾fected i.v. or i.m. with 106
 CFU K. pneumoniae as described above. 90
min and 4 h after infection, groups of five animals were anesthetized
and blood collected by intracardiac puncture into 5-ml pyrogen-free
plastic vials (Falcon; Becton-Dickinson Labware, Lincoln Park, NJ)
containing 25 IU of pyrogen-free heparin. The tubes were centrifuged
at 200 g for 10 min and plasma was collected and stored at 2708C un￾til assay.
Ex vivo cytokine production. Resident peritoneal macrophages
were harvested by rinsing the peritoneal cavity aseptically with cold
PBS containing 0.38% (wt/vol) sodium citrate. After centrifugation
for 10 min, 1800 cpm, at 48C, cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640
(Dutch modification; Flow Laboratories, Irvine, UK), containing 1 mM
pyruvate, 2 mM l-glutamine and 100 mg/ml gentamicin. 105
 cells/well
were cultured in 96-well microtiter plates (Costar Corporation, Cam￾bridge, MA) in RPMI medium (final volume 200 ml), with or without
LPS at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. No plasma or serum was
added to the culture medium. The supernatants were collected after
24 h of incubation at 378C, and stored at 2708C until assay. To the re￾maining macrophages, 200 ml RPMI 1640 was added, and the cells
were disrupted by three freeze-thaw cycles to determine the cell-asso￾ciated cytokine contents. The samples were stored at 2708C until
cytokine measurements.
The cytokine production capacity of peritoneal macrophages was
also measured after stimulation by heat-killed (1008C, 30 min) Staph￾ylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923). The suspension was washed three
times in RPMI (final concentration 2 3 107
 CFU/ml). 100 ml suspen￾sion containing 106
 microorganisms in RPMI were added to 105
 peri￾toneal macrophages in 96-well microtiter plates and the cells were in￾cubated 24 h at 378C. The samples were obtained and stored at 2708C
until cytokine measurements, as described above.
Cytokine measurements. TNFa, IL-1a and IL-1b concentrations
were determined using specific radioimmunoassays (RIAs) devel￾oped in our laboratory (24). Briefly, standards and samples were di￾luted in RIA-buffer (per liter: 10 mM Na2HPO4
.2H2O; 12 mM
EDTA; 1 ml sodium-azide (20% wt/vol); 2.5-gram bovine serum al￾bumin fraction IV (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO); 1 ml Triton
X-100; 25 ml aprotinin solution (Trasylol, containing 10,000 inhibitor
units per milliliter, Bayer BV, Mydrecht, The Netherlands) diluted
with deionized water milli-Q, pH 7.4. 100 ml of an appropriate mono￾specific rabbit antiserum against the respective mouse cytokine was
added to 100 ml of samples and standards. After vortexing, the tubes
were incubated for 24 h at 48C, followed by addition of 100 ml of the
respective 125I-labeled tracers. After 20 h, 750 ml RIA buffer contain￾ing 9% (wt/vol) polyethylene-glycol 6000, and 3% (vol/vol) goat anti–
rabbit IgG was added. The tubes were incubated for 20 min at room
temperature and then centrifuged at 1,500 g for 15 min. Supernatants
were discarded carefully and quickly drained on absorbent paper. Re￾maining radioactivity was counted in a gamma-counter. The radioac￾tivity in control tubes (the non-specific binding activity) was sub￾stracted from samples and standards. Detection limits were between
0.02 and 0.04 ng/ml. The mean of duplicate determinations was calcu￾lated for each sample. The accuracy of the cytokine assays was deter￾mined using reference preparations: murine recombinant TNFa, IL￾1a, and IL-1b obtained from the National Institute of Biological
Standards and Control (NIBSC, Hertfordshire, UK). Using various
batches of tracers the bias of all cytokine-assays was , 20%; interas￾say precision ranged between 10 and 13% depending on the concen￾tration (n 5 22).
LPS measurements. Plasma samples were diluted 1/100 and 1/600
with apyrogenic saline and heated at 758C for 5 min before the limu￾lus assay to remove the effect of serum inhibitors. LPS was deter￾mined in platelet-rich plasma by a chromogenic limulus amoebocyte
lysate assay (Endosafe Inc., Charleston, SC).
Radioactive labeling of LPS. E. coli O55:B5 LPS was labeled
with tritium as described previously (25) with minor modifications.
Briefly, LPS (5 mg/ml) was oxidized with sodium periodate (1.5 mg/
ml) in 50 mM acetate buffer, pH 4.0, during 24 h. The remaining peri￾odate was destroyed with ethylene glycol and the LPS was buffer￾changed and concentrated in an Amicon concentrator (molecular
cut-off 10,000 Da). 10 mCi [3H] sodium borohydride (specific activity

1368 Netea et al.
21 Ci/mmol) was added to the oxidized LPS (5 mg/ml) in 1 mM Tris￾HCl, pH 8.0. After a 2 h incubation at room temperature, the reaction
was terminated by the addition of 25 mg nonradioactive sodium boro￾hydride. The tritiated LPS was purified on a PD-10 column (Pharma￾cia, Woerden, The Netherlands). Subsequently, the unincorporated
3H was removed by repeated concentration in an Amicon concentra￾tor. Elution of the 3H-labeled LPS preparation on a PD-10 column in￾dicated that more than 95% of the 3H-label was associated with LPS
both in the fresh preparation, as well as in the preparation incubated
overnight at room temperature (the temperature of the incubation in
the binding studies). The specific activity of this 3H-LPS was 16,000
cpm/mg.
Binding of radiolabeled LPS to peritoneal macrophages. Peritoneal
macrophages from LDLR2/2 and C57Bl/6J mice were collected as
described above, and 106
 peritoneal macrophages were incubated in
100 ml RPMI 1640 in 0.5 ml Eppendorf plastic cups. No plasma or se￾rum was present in the system. Increasing amounts of [3H-LPS]
(10,000–100,000 cpm) were added and the cells were incubated at
room temperature for 45 min (26). Cells were spun down (2,000 g, 5
min), washed twice in 100 ml RPMI, solubilized in scintillation fluid
and counted in a b-counter. Nonspecific binding was determined in
the presence of a large excess of nonradioactive LPS. Specific binding
of LPS was defined as the difference between total and nonspecific
binding.
Determination of plasma lipids. Cholesterol and triglycerides were
determined by enzymatic methods on a Hitachi 747 analyzer.
Statistical analysis. Survival data were analyzed using the Kaplan￾Meyer log rank test (27). Differences in concentrations of cytokines
and in organ counts of the microorganisms were analyzed using the
Kruskall-Wallis test (28). Differences were considered significant at
P , 0.05. All experiments were performed at least twice.
Results
Lethal endotoxemia model. Plasma cholesterol concentra￾tions are presented in Table I. The total cholesterol concentra￾tions were fourfold higher in LDLR2/2 mice at all the time
points tested. The plasma triglyceride concentrations differed
only marginally in the two mouse strains both 90 min
(0.6760.13 vs. 0.6260.09 mmol/liter, P . 0.05) and 4 h
(0.5060.07 vs. 0.4260.06 mmol/liter, P . 0.05) after LPS. The
survival of the LDLR2/2 mice was significantly increased
when compared with C57Bl/6J mice, the estimated endotoxin
LD50 dose being 8-times higher (P , 0.001) (Fig. 1). Mortality
occurred in the first 48 h after endotoxin administration, with￾out further mortality during the next days of the follow-up.
Plasma concentrations of TNFa were significantly lower in
LDLR2/2 mice 90 min after LPS administration, than in con￾trol animals (1.560.5 vs. 3.760.9 ng/ml, P , 0.02) (Fig. 2).
Four hours after the endotoxin challenge, IL-1a concentra￾tions were also lower in LDLR2/2 mice (60621 vs. 106626
pg/ml, P , 0.05), while no differences in IL-1b concentrations
were detected (3669 vs. 3769 pg/ml, P . 0.05) (Fig. 2).
Lethal cytokinemia model. To investigate whether the pro￾tection to a lethal injection of endotoxin is due to decreased
susceptibility to proinflammatory cytokines, mice were in￾jected i.v. with pro-inflammatory cytokines. The administra￾tion of either 50 mg recombinant human TNFa or 10 mg IL-1a
did not induce any mortality. After the administration of a
combination of these cytokines, no protection by the high lipo￾protein concentrations of LDLR2/2 mice was observed. The
mortality was 0% in both mouse strains when a combination of
10 mg of TNFa and 1 mg IL-1a was injected. When a combina￾tion of 20 mg TNFa with 5 mg IL-1a was injected the mortality
was 20% in LDLR2/2 mice and 33% in the C57Bl/6J mice
(P . 0.05), and when a combination of 50 mg TNFa with 10 mg
IL-1a was injected the mortality was 80% in LDLR2/2 mice,
and 91% in controls (P . 0.05). The mortality occurred exclu￾sively during the first 48 h.
Klebsiella pneumoniae infection. Cholesterol concentrations
during K. pneumoniae infection decreased in both strains of
mice. However, they remained significantly higher in LDLR2/2
mice than in control mice (Table I). No significant differences
in triglyceride levels 90 min after infection were found be￾tween the LDLR2/2 and C57Bl/6J mice (0.7960.11 vs.

LPS challenge. Groups of at least five animals received an intrave￾nous LPS challenge with the dosages shown on the x-axis and the out￾come was recorded as percentage mortality after 48 h. LDLR2/2
mice had a significantly improved survival when compared with the 
control animals.

significantly decreased in LDLR2/2 mice when compared with con￾trol mice. No differences in IL-1b plasma concentrations were de￾tected 4 h after LPS was injected. *P , 0.05; **P , 0.02.

0.7560.06 mmol/liter, P . 0.05). However, 4 h after infection
the triglycerides concentrations were slightly higher in
LDLR2/2 mice than controls (0.7960.21 vs. 0.5160.07 mmol/
liter, P , 0.05). After i.v. injection of 107
 CFU of K. pneumo￾niae, LDLR2/2 mice showed a delayed and decreased mor￾tality (70%) compared with control animals (100%, P , 0.01)
(Fig. 3). After an i.v. infection with 106
 CFU, only 42% of
LDLR2/2 mice died, in comparison with 67% of the C57Bl/
6J mice (P , 0.05) (Fig. 3). In the K. pneumoniae infection
models studied, no deaths occurred after 14 d of infection. No
differences in K. pneumoniae outgrowth in the organs of the
two groups 24 h after infection was observed (Table II). Also,
quantitative blood cultures revealed no differences between
the two mouse strains (Table II). However, the LPS concen￾trations in LDLR2/2 mice tended to be lower when com￾pared with C57Bl/6J mice, in both strains reaching high values
90 min after i.v. injection of Klebsiella, and decreasing at 4 h
(Table III). TNFa concentrations in the plasma of LDLR2/2
mice measured 90 min after infection were lower compared
with control mice, although statistical significance was not
reached (0.4560.46 vs. 0.8160.61 ng/ml, P . 0.05). Concentra￾tions of IL-1a in the plasma of LDLR2/2 mice were lower as
compared with control mice at 4 h after infection (56640 vs.
11469 pg/ml, P , 0.04); only marginally lower IL-1b was de￾tected in LDLR2/2 mice (55621 vs. 78613 pg/ml, P . 0.05).
When the more sustained K. pneumoniae infection was in￾duced by intramuscular injection of 106
 CFU, the survival in
the LDLR2/2 group was 56%, while only 11% of the control
animals survived (P , 0.05). Most of the animals died between
days 5 and 12 of the follow-up. No differences in the outgrowth
of K. pneumoniae in the organs and blood of the two mouse
strains were found (Table II). LPS plasma concentrations were
similar in both mouse strains (Table III). The LPS determina￾tions were performed after heating the plasma, a process
which liberates lipoprotein-bound LPS, and thus the total
plasma LPS rather than the free LPS concentrations were as￾sessed. Compared with i.v. infection, the LPS concentrations
during the i.m. infection were lower 90 min after infection, but
higher at 4 h. This was also accompanied by later increases in
cytokines: TNFa and IL-1a plasma concentrations in most of
the samples after 90 min were below the detection limit, to be￾come detectable at 4 h. At the latter time point, a tendency to￾wards decreased circulating concentrations of TNFa (101689
vs. 2356228 pg/mL, P . 0.05) and IL-1a (35612 vs. 85652 pg/
ml, P . 0.05) was observed in the LDLR2/2 mice when com￾pared with controls, although statistical significance was not
reached. IL-1b concentrations were below detection limit both
90 min and 4 h after infection.
Ex vivo cytokine production capacity. To investigate whether
the decreased in vivo cytokine production by the LDLR2/2
mice was due to reduced cellular production capacity, rather
than to LPS binding and neutralization by the high lipoprotein
concentrations, resident peritoneal macrophages were stimu￾lated in vitro by LPS in the absence of plasma or serum. Some￾what surprisingly, cytokine concentrations in supernatants of
macrophages from LDLR2/2 mice were 2–3-fold higher af￾ter LPS stimulation when compared with C57Bl/6J mice (Fig.
4 a). The cell-associated TNFa did not differ between the two
mouse strains, while both cell-associated IL-1a and IL-1b were
increased in LDLR2/2 mice (Fig. 4 b). This increased cyto￾kine production capacity was observed only after LPS stimula￾tion, and was not detected after stimulation with heat-killed
Staphylococcus aureus (Fig. 4, a and b).
Binding of tritiated LPS to peritoneal macrophages. To test
whether the increased cytokine production capacity was due to
increased LPS binding to macrophages, we assessed the spe￾cific binding of [3H-LPS] to the peritoneal macrophages of the
two mouse strains. The specific binding of radiolabeled LPS to

Discussion
In this study we showed that LDL receptor deficient mice
were protected against lethal endotoxemia as well as against
severe infections with Gram-negative microorganisms, not
only after acute i.v. infection, but also in a more subacute
model of intramuscular infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae.
Lipoprotein concentrations in the LDLR2/2 mice are geneti￾cally elevated, due to increased IDL and LDL (22). Our ap￾proach thus differs from other models in which exogenous li￾poproteins were administered to obtain hyperlipoproteinemia
(10, 11, 18). This intervention was associated with decreased
cytokinemia and improved survival during lethal endotoxemia.
The same protection was reported in mice in which endoge￾nously elevated HDL were responsible for the increased lipo￾proteins (19). The importance of endogenous lipoproteins in
the protection against lethal endotoxemia was also observed
by Feingold and colleagues (20), who reported increased LPS￾induced mortality when serum lipids were decreased by phar￾macological agents. However, our study shows that the pro￾tection due to increased endogenous LDL can be extended to
severe Gram-negative infections with live microorganisms.
In general, mortality to infection is considered to be due to
lethal cytokinemia or to functional impairment by excessive
growth of microorganisms in the organs of the host. In the model
of infection we studied, showing no difference in the number
of circulating bacteria or the number of bacteria in the tissues,
the protection was probably achieved through the high levels
of LDL in the LDLR2/2 mice, which are able to neutralize
the effects of LPS released by similar bacterial loads as in the
control mice, and consequently inhibit the induction of lethal
concentrations of cytokines. The crucial role of cytokines in
the response to a Gram-negative infection, independently of
the bacterial load, has also been documented in our previous
studies (29, 30).
The protection against the LPS component of Gram-nega￾tive bacteria by lipoproteins is achieved either by direct neu￾tralization of LPS by forming LPS-lipoprotein complexes (8,
9, 10), or by accelerating the clearance of LPS by lipoproteins
(11). In this respect, we considered if in our study an increased
clearance of LPS or the direct neutralization of LPS by lipo￾proteins is playing the main role in the protection of LDLR2/2
mice during K. pneumoniae infection. The LPS concentrations
tended to be lower in LDLR2/2 mice than in controls when
the infection was induced by i.v. injection of K. pneumoniae.
This may be due to increased LPS clearance, since we deter￾mined the LPS concentrations after heating the plasma before
the assay, a procedure which liberates lipoprotein-bound LPS
(31). However, in the i.m. K. pneumoniae infection model, the
LPS concentrations were similar in the LDLR2/2 and control
mice. Since LDLR2/2 mice in this model also showed de￾creased circulating cytokines, as well as decreased mortality

 CFU K. 
pneumoniae was given to LDLR2/2 (closed triangles) and C57Bl/6J 
mice (closed circles). Other groups of LDLR2/2 (open triangles) 
and C57Bl/6J mice (open circles) received 106
 CFU K. pneumoniae.
Survival was significantly improved in LDLR2/2 mice. The figure 
gives pooled data of three experiments with at least 18 mice per 
group each.

Lipoproteins Protect Against Gram-negative Infections 1371
compared with control mice, we conclude that probably the
main mechanism of protection of LDLR2/2 mice in K. pneu￾moniae infection is through direct binding and neutralization
of LPS by lipoproteins, rather than increased clearance of en￾dotoxin. This is not surprising since the clearance of LDL,
which is the main lipoprotein fraction increased in the
LDLR2/2 mice, is decreased in these mice (22), due to the
lack of the receptor.
The increased cytokine concentrations in the circulation
during Gram-negative infections are thought to be induced by
the LPS component of the cell wall. We have shown that
LDLR2/2 mice were more LPS tolerant, the LPS LD50 in
LDLR2/2 mice being increased approximately eightfold. As￾sociated with the increased protection of LDLR2/2 mice we
observed decreased concentrations of the pro-inflammatory
cytokines TNFa and IL-1a. The LDLR2/2 mice were not
protected against a lethal injection of these cytokines, arguing
against a direct inactivation of circulating cytokines by lipopro￾teins, and against decreased peripheral sensitivity of LDLR2/2
mice to TNFa or IL-1. This confirms that the protection of
LDLR2/2 mice in lethal endotoxemia is due to an inactiva￾tion of the bacterial LPS by increased plasma lipoproteins,
which in turn results in a blunted response of the pro￾inflammatory cytokines.
An interesting observation was made when we evaluated
the in-vitro cytokine production capacity of the LDLR2/2
mice. We showed that, in contrast to the in-vivo decreased
cytokine production after LPS challenge, the in-vitro LPS￾stimulated cytokine production capacity of peritoneal mac￾rophages of mice with hypercholesterolemia was higher than
in control mice. This increase was observed for all the cyto￾kines tested: TNFa, IL-1a and IL-1b. An explanation for these
findings could be up-regulation of LPS receptors on the mac￾rophages of LDLR2/2 mice. Indeed, our LPS-binding experi￾ments showed increased specific binding of tritiated LPS to the
macrophages of LDLR2/2 mice. In normal mice, exposure to
small LPS quantities may down-regulate its own receptors on
the host cells, as has been shown for the CD14 molecule on hu￾man cells (32). We hypothesize that in the LDLR2/2 mice,
such down-regulation of LPS receptors may not occur because
the enhanced plasma lipoproteins rapidly bind and neutralize
the circulating endotoxin. In our experiments, stimulation with
S. aureus did not induce an enhanced cytokine production by
the macrophages of LDLR2/2 mice, suggesting a selective
down-regulation of LPS-receptors. Still, a direct effect of the
high lipoprotein concentrations on the LPS receptors and LPS
binding cannot be excluded, since others have shown that cho￾lesterol modulates CD14 expression on human cells (33), and
the clustering of other glycophospholipid-anchored receptors
(34). Because LPS binds not only to CD14, but also to CD11b/
CD18, to the scavenger receptor, and possibly other mem￾brane proteins, it remains to be elucidated which of these re￾ceptors and mechanisms contributed to the increased LPS
binding.
An increased cytokine production capacity has also been
observed in monocytes of patients with familial hypercholes￾terolemia (35) and in individuals with high plasma HDL con￾centrations (36). The results of these studies and our present
findings argue for a more general phenomenon of increased
cytokine production by monocytes/macrophages of hosts with
high circulating lipoprotein concentrations. The clinical impor￾tance of this phenomenon remains to be further studied.
