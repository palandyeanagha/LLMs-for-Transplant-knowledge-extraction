Sir,
Scopulariopsis, which is a genus of non-dermatophytic 
filamentous fungi, contains a number of common sa￾prophytic fungi found in soil, vegetables, air, and organic 
waste. To date, eight species of Scopulariopsis have been 
reported to cause human infections. Of these, S. brevi￾caulis is the most common; although is not generally 
considered to be a skin pathogen, the organism is isolated 
relatively frequently from onychomycosis patients (1). 
However, deeper cutaneous infection caused by S. brevi￾caulis is extremely rare. We describe here a woman with 
treatment-resistant S. brevicaulis facial infection after a 
filler injection performed by an unlicensed practitioner.
CASE REPORT
A 42-year-old woman presented in June 2008 with an ulcer 
covered by a black crust and surrounding palpable tender no￾dules on the right temple (Fig. 1). In September 2006, she had 
received collagen injections into both temples, administered by 
an unlicensed practitioner. About 6 months later, she detected 
palpable nodules on both temples. She visited the unlicensed 
practitioner again, and received intralesional injections of an 
unknown material (described as a neutralizing agent) into both 
temples. Thereafter, her face became gradually more swollen, and 
an ulcer developed on her right temple. The patient was otherwise 
healthy, and routine laboratory tests, including blood tests and a 
chest roentgenogram, yielded data within normal limits.
A skin biopsy was performed of a palpable nodule beside the 
crusted ulcer. Histology disclosed numerous branching septated 
hyphae and conidia in the deep dermis and subcutaneous fat 
(Fig. 2a). Fungal culture revealed entire-edged flat colonies with 
powdery, buff-to-brown, rugose surfaces. The reverse of the 
specimen culture was more waxy and yellow-white in colour. 
Lactophenol cotton blue mounts revealed numerous branching 
and septated hyphae with conidiophores and conidia in basipetal 
chains (Fig. 2b). As a Scopulariopsis infection was suspected, 
internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing was performed 
to identify the isolate. An ABI PRISM 3130xl genetic analyser 
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and a Big-Dye 
Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) were 
employed. We found 100% homology with S. brevicaulis IFM 
54315 (GenBank accession no. AB363754) and 99.5% (593 
bp/596 bp) homology with S. brevicaulis CTSP F6 (GenBank 
accession no. EU862178) (2). Because the species showing 
the next-best homology (98.7%) was S. flava (GenBank ac￾cession no. AY494711), we identified the isolate as S. brevi￾caulis (Fig. 3S, http://adv.medicaljournals.se/article/abstract/ 
10.2340/00015555-0713/fig3) (2).
Treatment with itraconazole (200 mg daily) and terbinafine 
(250 mg daily) was commenced, but, after one week, the crusted 
ulcer was much enlarged. We decided to hospitalize the patient, 
and surgical debridement was performed. Itraconazole and 
terbinafine administration were simultaneously terminated and 
intravenous amphotericin B (1 mg/kg daily) was commenced. 
Approximately 2 weeks later, blood creatinine level increased, 
but the glomerular filtration rate fell. Amphotericin B therapy 
was terminated, and itraconazole (200 mg daily) was again ad￾ministered. During the next 12 weeks, the ulcer size decreased, 
but repeated fungal cultures revealed growth of the originally 
isolated organism. Therefore, a flap operation was performed to 
cover the ulcer, and, simultaneously, drug therapy was changed 
to itraconazole 125 mg daily and terbinafine 250 mg daily. After 
2 weeks, however, our patient reported a palpable nodule on her 
left temple. A skin biopsy revealed multiple fungal hyphae. She 
was hospitalized once more and voriconazole (4 mg/kg twice 
daily) was initiated. However, within one week, blood levels 
of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase 
were markedly increased and the drugs were discontinued. We 
then treated the patient with terbinafine (250 mg daily) and 
clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) for 3 weeks. She did not 
present to us again.
In vitro testing of S. brevicaulis drug susceptibility was per￾formed (3). The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for 
amphotericin B were 8 μg/ml, for fluconazole > 64 μg/ml, for 
itraconazole > 16 μg/ml, for voriconazole 4 μg/ml, for caspo￾fungin 4 μg/ml, and for micafungin > 16 μg/ml.
DISCUSSION
Although 1–10% of onychomycosis cases are caused 
by S. brevicaulis, cutaneous infections are rare (except

in the nails) (1). In immunocompetent patients, S. 
brevicaulis infections usually develop after trauma or 
surgery. However, cutaneous S. brevicaulis infections 
without previous injury have been reported (4–7). In 
immunocompromised patients, several cases of inva￾sive systemic infections have been reported (8–10).
Treatment of S. brevicaulis infections is difficult. 
Several drug susceptibility studies have shown that 
the organism is resistant to broad-spectrum antifungal 
agents including amphotericin B, flucytosine, flucona￾zole, itraconazole, voriconazole, and terbinafine (7, 11, 
12). However, in many cases, in vitro data differ from 
in vivo observations (5, 6). Generally, in immunocom￾petent patients, cutaneous S. brevicaulis infections 
can be treated successfully using modern antifungal 
agents. However, the minimal fungicidal concentration 
(MFC) for S. brevicaulis is higher than the MFC for 
dermatophytic fungi. In a previous report of cutaneous 
S. brevicaulis infection, ringworm lesions on the legs 
of a 14-year-old girl were cleared with terbinafine 
(250 mg daily) and itraconazole (100 mg daily) (4). 
An ulcerative granulomatous cheilitis with lymphatic 
invasion in a 43-year-old man was completely healed 
on administration of itraconazole (200 mg daily) for 
2 months (5). In that case, the itraconazole MIC for 
S. brevicaulis was greater than 100 μg/ml (5). However, 
a plantar infection in a 42-year-old woman was resistant 
to both terbinafine and itraconazole (6). In addition, a 
granulomatous skin infection in a 14-year-old girl could 
not be readily cleared with terbinafine and itraconazole 
(7). In immunocompromised patients, treatment tends 
to be much more difficult.
Therefore, some authors have recommended a com￾bination of surgical debridement and antifungal agent 
therapy to clear S. brevicaulis infections (8, 9). In our 
patient, however, several combination treatments, in￾cluding itraconazole, terbinafine, amphotericin B, and 
voriconazole, with concurrent surgical debridement, 
failed to resolve the problem.
A similar case has been reported in a Korean journal 
(13). A 54-year-old woman, who had received filler 
injections, developed cellulitis-like lesions. Liposuction 
was performed to remove foreign materials and necrotic 
tissue, and pus cultures revealed S. brevicaulis infec￾tion. Although this patient did not ingest any antifungal 
agents, no recurrence was noted at 6 months. In another 
interesting case, antifungal- and cryotherapy-resistant 
subcutaneous hyalohyphomycosis in an immunocom￾petent patient was almost completely healed within one 
month after application of topical 5% imiquimod cream 
(14). Although the causative fungus, Acremonium stric￾tum, was not the same as in our patient, the observation 
may be relevant.
Our patient received a collagen injection from an un￾licensed practitioner. We have treated one other patient 
with a Mycobacterium chelonae infection developed 
after collagen injection by the same person (15).
