Abstract
Objectives: To evaluate late mortality and morbidity after an atrial
switch procedure for correction of transposition of the great arteries
(TGA) and to assess predictive factors for adverse outcome.
Setting: Tertiary referral centre.
Design and patients: Retrospective follow up study of 137 patients
surviving hospitalisation for TGA atrial switch procedure (Mustard
or Senning) in a single institution and divided into two groups
(simple and complex) depending on presurgical anatomy. Several
surgical and follow up factors were evaluated during 16.7 (5.6)
years’ follow up.
Results: Late mortality was 5.1% (95% confidence interval 1.37%
to 8.84%) with sudden death as the most common cause. No
significant difference was found between Mustard and Senning
procedures and between the complex and simple groups in terms of
mortality. Independent predictive factors for late mortality were a
history of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias and advanced New
York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class during follow up. A


very common finding was development of sinus node dysfunction
(47.6%), which had no influence on mortality. There was little need
for reintervention (5.1%) and relatively few cases of right
ventricular systolic dysfunction (14.6%). During follow up, most
patients (96.2%) were in NYHA functional class I–II.
Conclusions: Overall long term outcomes of patients with atrial
repair of TGA in the present era are encouraging in terms of late
mortality and quality of life. Nevertheless, better outcomes may be
offered through improved diagnostic methods for right ventricular
function and better management of supraventricular
tachyarrhythmias.
