Abstract
BACKGROUND The development of pulmonary infiltrates is a
frequent life threatening complication in immunocompromised
patients, requiring early diagnosis and specific treatment. In the
present study non-invasive and bronchoscopic diagnostic techniques
were applied in patients with different non-HIV
immunocompromised conditions to determine the aetiology of the
pulmonary infiltrates and to evaluate the impact of these methods
on therapeutic decisions and outcome in this population.
METHODS The non-invasive diagnostic methods included
serological tests, blood antigen detection, and blood,
nasopharyngeal wash (NPW), sputum and tracheobronchial aspirate
(TBAS) cultures. Bronchoscopic techniques included fibrobronchial
aspirate (FBAS), protected specimen brush (PSB), and
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Two hundred consecutive episodes
of pulmonary infiltrates were prospectively evaluated during a 30
month period in 52 solid organ transplant recipients, 53
haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients, 68 patients
with haematological malignancies, and 27 patients requiring
chronic treatment with corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive
drugs.
RESULTS An aetiological diagnosis was obtained in 162 (81%) of
the 200 patients. The aetiology of the pulmonary infiltrates was
infectious in 125 (77%) and non-infectious in 37 (23%); 38 (19%)
remained undiagnosed. The main infectious aetiologies were
bacterial (48/125, 24%), fungal (33/125, 17%), and viral (20/125,


10%), and the most frequent pathogens were Aspergillus fumigatus
(n=29),Staphylococcus aureus (n=17), andPseudomonas aeruginosa
(n=12). Among the non-infectious aetiologies, pulmonary oedema
(16/37, 43%) and diffuse alveolar haemorrhage (10/37, 27%) were
the most common causes. Non-invasive techniques led to the
diagnosis of pulmonary infiltrates in 41% of the cases in which they
were used; specifically, the diagnostic yield of blood cultures was
30/191 (16%); sputum cultures 27/88 (31%); NPW 9/50 (18%);
and TBAS 35/55 (65%). Bronchoscopic techniques led to the
diagnosis of pulmonary infiltrates in 59% of the cases in which they
were used: FBAS 16/28 (57%), BAL 68/135 (51%), and PSB 30/125
(24%). The results obtained with the different techniques led to a
change in antibiotic treatment in 93 cases (46%). Although changes
in treatment did not have an impact on the overall mortality,
patients with pulmonary infiltrates of an infectious aetiology in
whom the change was made during the first 7 days had a better
outcome (29% mortality) than those in whom treatment was
changed later (71% mortality; p=0.001).
CONCLUSIONS Non-invasive and bronchoscopic procedures are
useful techniques for the diagnosis of pulmonary infiltrates in
immunocompromised patients. Bronchial aspirates (FBAS and
TBAS) and BAL have the highest diagnostic yield and impact on
therapeutic decisions.
