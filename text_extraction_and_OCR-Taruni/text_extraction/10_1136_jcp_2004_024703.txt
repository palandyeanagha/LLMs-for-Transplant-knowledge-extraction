Abstract
Background: Invasive fungal infections are often diagnosed by
histopathology without identification of the causative fungi, which
show significantly different antifungal susceptibilities.
Aims: To establish and evaluate a system of two seminested
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays to identify and discriminate
between agents of aspergillosis and mucormycosis in paraffin wax
embedded tissue samples.
Methods: DNA of 52 blinded samples from five different centres
was extracted and used as a template in two PCR assays targeting


the mitochondrial aspergillosis DNA and the 18S ribosomal DNA of
zygomycetes.
Results: Specific fungal DNA was identified in 27 of 44 samples in
accordance with a histopathological diagnosis of zygomycosis or
aspergillosis, respectively. Aspergillus fumigatus DNA was amplified
from one specimen of zygomycosis (diagnosed by histopathology).
In four of 16 PCR negative samples no human DNA was amplified,
possibly as a result of the destruction of DNA before paraffin wax
embedding. In addition, eight samples from clinically suspected
fungal infections (without histopathological proof) were examined.
The two PCR assays detected a concomitant infection with Absidia
corymbifera and A fumigatus in one, and infections with Rhizopus
arrhizus and A fumigatus in another two cases.
Conclusions: The two seminested PCR assays described here can
support a histopathological diagnosis of mucormycosis or
aspergillosis, and can identify the infective agent, thereby
optimising antifungal treatment.
