Abstract
The gastrointestinal tract is a specialized organ in which dynamic interactions between host cells and the complex
environment occur in addition to food digestion. Together with the chemical barrier of the mucosal layer and the
cellular immune system, the epithelial cell layer performs a pivotal role as the first physical barrier against external
factors and maintains a symbiotic relationship with commensal bacteria. The tight junction proteins, including
occludin, claudins, and zonula occludens, are crucial for the maintenance of epithelial barrier integrity. To allow the
transport of essential molecules and restrict harmful substances, the intracellular signaling transduction system and a
number of extracellular stimuli such as cytokines, small GTPases, and post-translational modifications dynamically
modulate the tight junction protein complexes. An imbalance in these regulations leads to compromised barrier
integrity and is linked with pathological conditions. Despite the obscurity of the causal relationship, the loss of barrier
integrity is considered to contribute to inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, and metabolic disorders. The elucidation
of the role of diseases in barrier integrity and the underlying regulatory mechanisms have improved our
understanding of the intestinal barrier to allow the development of novel and potent therapeutic approaches.
Introduction
The intestinal epithelial layer forms the major barrier
that separates our body from the external environment.
Trillions of commensal bacteria reside in the gastro￾intestinal tract and have a vital role in digestion and the
development of the immune system. However, they pre￾sent a risk of infection1
. The maintenance of the intestinal
epithelial barrier is the essential function of the intestinal
epithelial cells (IECs). The IECs integrate positive and
negative interactions from the microbiota living in the gut
and signal the immune cells to accommodate the micro￾biota, thereby perpetuating the normal function of the
body2–4
. An imbalance in the intestinal barrier structure
can flare up into an uncontrollable immune reaction in
the intestinal microenvironment or allow the unrestrained
growth of microbiota, which leads to various diseases,
including intestinal inflammatory disorders, extra￾intestinal autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid
arthritis and multiple sclerosis, and metabolic disorders
such as diabetes and obesity4–6
. Critically ill patients and
patients receiving chemotherapy/radiotherapy show
severely compromised intestinal barrier integrity.
Asymptomatic close relatives of patients with inflamma￾tory bowel diseases (IBDs) also show compromised bar￾rier integrity. Intestinal barrier permeability may therefore
be a prognostic marker for disease pathophysiology;
similarly, targeting the intestinal barrier permeability
holds promise for therapy and for the prevention of
disease.
Intestinal epithelial barrier
The intestinal epithelial barrier is a one-cell-thick
internal lining of the gut that contains different types of
epithelial cells. Underneath the epithelial layer, there is a
thin layer of connective tissue, the lamina propria, which
has a crucial role in nurturing healthy communication

between the microbiome and the immune cells. The
intestinal epithelial system is also home to immune cells,
including dendritic cells, T cells, B cells, and macro￾phages, which function in close relation with the IECs to
maintain intestinal homeostasis3,7
. Gut microbiota, con￾sisting of hundreds of trillions of bacteria and viruses, are
pivotal for the maintenance of a symbiotic relationship
with immune cells8–10. Recent studies have reported
compelling evidence for the metabolic, immunological,
and physiological roles had by the gut microbiota. How￾ever, the first layer of defense in the epithelium of the gut
is formed by a layer of mucus, which is critical for the
limitation of the exposure of epithelial cells to the
microbiome11. The absence of mucin, a highly glycosy￾lated polymeric protein in the mucous layer, makes an
animal vulnerable to intestinal inflammation, which leads
to the development of spontaneous colitis and confers a
predisposition to the development of colorectal cancers
(Fig. 1).
Cellular functions of IECs
The intestinal epithelial layer is highly dynamic and
characterized by a remarkable turnover rate; IECs are
rapidly renewed and replaced every couple of days12,13.
The maintenance of this cell layer renewal requires tight
regulation to avoid any imbalance in homeostasis14,15.
The intestinal epithelial monolayer is composed of dif￾ferent types of specialized epithelial cells, such as enter￾ocytes, Paneth cells, goblet cells, endocytes, and microfold
cells, each with a distinct function. The most abundant of
these are IECs or enterocytes, for which the major func￾tion is the maintenance of epithelial barrier integrity16,17.
Paneth cells reside in the base of crypts and secrete anti￾microbial peptides, such as α-defensin, to impede
microbial entry to the intestinal lumen. Goblet cells
secrete mucous, trefoil peptides, and resistin-like mole￾cule-β, which are central to both the defense and repair of
the epithelial layer and have significant roles in epithelial
homeostasis18–20. Endocytes regulate incoming antigens
and microfold cells secrete IgA, which, in addition to
goblet cells, helps present bacterial antigens to dendritic
cells. Collectively, these cells form a polarized layer to
establish a tight barrier by virtue of intracellular tight
junctions, adherens junctions, and desmosomes.
IECs are capable of phagocytosing bacteria and can also
sequester and neutralize bacterial toxins. These cells are
also specialized to recognize bacterial-derived molecules,
known as prokaryotic-associated molecular patterns,
with the help of the Toll-like receptors on the cell surface
and the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain￾like receptors in the cytoplasm, which activate defense
mechanisms by the secretion of anti-microbial peptides2
.
IECs also maintain two-way communication with the
underlying immune cells to regulate the inflammatory
response against bacterial toxins21. In conjunction with
the mucosal layer and specialized cells, the epithelial layer
forms a well-equipped, intricately regulated and stringent
barrier with continuous scrutiny by immune cells to
create an immune-silent environment.
Mechanism of regulation of intestinal epithelial
tight junction proteins
A crucial function of IECs is the maintenance of barrier
integrity, which allows the permeability of essential ions,
nutrients, and water but restricts the entry of bacterial
toxins and pathogens21. The transport of molecules across
the epithelial layer occurs through three major pathways:
the trans-cellular pathway (passive diffusion across the
cell membranes), the carrier-mediated pathway (carrier/
receptor-mediated trans-cellular pathway), and the para￾cellular pathway (passive diffusion between the spaces
through adjacent cells). The epithelial tight junction
proteins, the most apical component of epithelial intra￾cellular junctions, equip IECs with this function, which
seals the paracellular space between the cells and tightly
restricts the transport of hydrophilic molecules22–24. That
is, the main function attributed to the tight junction
proteins is the “gate and fence function,” which allows the
paracellular transport of some solutes and molecules but
prevents the intramembrane transport of proteins, lipids,
and microbial-derived peptides25,26. Any alteration in
the tight junction structure can prove to be detrimental
to the organism.
Fig. 1 Intestinal epithelial barrier. Epithelial cells form a layer that
functions as a physical barrier facilitated by tight connections between
each cell. A number of tight junction protein components seal the
paracellular pathway and conduct gate and fence functions. The
mucosal layer is a chemical barrier that is critical to limit the contact
between the microbiome and epithelial cells. Immune cells are also a
major participant in the immune response and the tolerance of the
host against external substances. The graphical illustration was drawn

The tight junction is composed of several transmem￾brane and cytosolic proteins, including occludin, claudins,
zonula occludens (ZOs), tricellulin, cingulin, and junc￾tional adhesion molecules (JAM), which interact with
each other, as well as with the cytoskeleton, and form a
complex architecture27. Most of these proteins, except for
cingulin and ZO, are integral membrane proteins that
extend into the paracellular spaces between the cells.
Cingulin and ZOs are cytoskeletal linker proteins, which
interact with the cytoplasmic peripheral membrane pro￾teins, occludin, claudin, and JAM to form strong cross￾links and interact with the membrane cytoskeleton com￾posed of F-actin and myosin. Together with intracellular
signaling proteins, tight junction proteins activate a ple￾thora of cellular processes to maintain barrier integrity28.
Tight junction complexes are the rate-limiting factor for
paracellular permeability; they are programmed to rapidly
open and seal the barrier in the event of injury and other
signals. They form a highly dynamic entity, continuously
transmitting signals to the individual components that
undergo a series of regulations to enhance or modulate
the integrity of the intestinal barrier.
Although it is well-accepted that tight junctions are
crucial for the maintenance of barrier integrity, the exact
function of the individual tight junction proteins remain
elusive. Over the years, researchers have highlighted the
diverse functions performed by tight junction proteins.
Occludin, the first identified tight junction protein,29,30
has a dual role in the intestinal barrier; it provides
structural integrity to the tight junction and is an integral
component in the barrier function of tight junctions31.
The expression level of occludin was found to be closely
correlated with the barrier properties in vitro and
in vivo32–35. Interestingly, occludin knockout mice had
morphologically intact tight junctions but displayed
complex histological phenotypes, with chronic inflam￾mation and a defective epithelial barrier, which implicated
that its crucial role was in tight junction stability rather
than tight junction assembly. In contrast, certain other
studies reported normal barrier function in occludin￾deficient mice but showed chronic inflammation and
hyperplasia in the gastric epithelium and testicular atro￾phy36,37. Severely compromised occludin expression has
been observed in disease models of intestinal inflamma￾tory diseases, which suggests it has a critical role in the
maintenance of barrier integrity38–40. Collectively, these
studies indicated that the functions of occludin are
complex, and the mechanism by which occludin regulates
the tight junction should be investigated in great detail.
Claudins, the other major tight junction proteins, are
responsible for the regulation of paracellular space27,41,42.
There are several isoforms of claudin, each having
potentially different roles43,44, and a fine balance between
them is needed for the maintenance of paracellular
integrity. Alterations in the claudin levels can affect the
intestinal barrier integrity in different ways depending on
the type of claudin isoform45. For example, the down￾regulation of claudin 5 and 8 can drastically reduce the
barrier integrity46; in contrast, claudin-2, a tight junction
protein required for the formation of paracellular water
channels that is highly expressed in leaky epithelial tis￾sues, is upregulated in IBDs and promotes inflamma￾tion27,46,47. ZOs are peripheral membrane-associated
proteins ubiquitously expressed in epithelial and endo￾thelial cells. The various isoforms, ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3,
are all characterized by their ability to interact with dif￾ferent cellular proteins through a multitude of protein
binding domains, such as the SH3 domain, the PDZ
domain, and the leucine-zipper domain,48,49 and are also
essential for scaffold formation and the connection of
other tight junction proteins to the cytoskeleton. JAM-A,
another tight junction protein, is also implicated in the
maintenance of intestinal barrier integrity. JAM-A￾deficient mice have increased barrier permeability with
elevated bacterial translocation; however, they do not
develop spontaneous colitis50,51. The roles of other tight
junction proteins and their mechanism of action remain
largely unknown.
Tight junction proteins are closely regulated, which is
imperative for the maintenance of normal barrier integ￾rity. IECs proliferate rapidly and renew quickly, and it is
essential that the tight junction proteins are also strictly
regulated to avoid any detrimental effect on membrane
integrity52. They are also capable of efficiently adapting to
the different demands of the cell by sealing, opening, and
maintaining paracellular transport under various physio￾logical and pathological conditions53.
The mechanism of the regulation of tight junction
proteins is intricate and somewhat obscure. The tight
junction proteins are regulated by multiple signaling
proteins and signaling molecules. Several molecules
involved in the signal transduction processes, including
small GTP-binding proteins and tyrosine kinases, such as
c-Src, c-Yes, and protein kinase C (PKC), have been found
to be localized at these tight junctions, presumably indi￾cating their pivotal role in the maintenance of tight
junction integrity54,55. A significant body of evidence has
highlighted the role of cytokines in the regulation of
various tight junction proteins in a multitude of patho￾logical conditions.
Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), interferon-γ (IFN-γ),
and interleukins all are well-known for their indisputable
role in the regulation of tight junction integrity56. TNFα is
a key player in the caveolin-1-mediated internalization of
occludin, which elevates gut permeability; further, the
overexpression of occludin alleviates the cytokine￾induced increase in gut permeability57. TNFα stimula￾tion of the NFκB signal transduction pathway is another

major mechanism involved in tight junction regulation58.
NFκB inhibition protected mice from severe water
loss and diarrhea, which indicated its role in the regula￾tion of the barrier property of IECs. The mechanism
through which IFNγ modulates epithelial permeability
is still under investigation; however, the acto-myosin
cytoskeletal interaction with tight junction proteins is
thought to be altered by IFNγ treatment59–61. IFNγ also
induces an increase in barrier permeability through the
reduction of ZO-1 and occludin expression in an adeno￾sine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-
dependent pathway, irrespective of the cellular energy
levels62. The simultaneous presence of both these cyto￾kines has a detrimental effect on intestinal integrity
through the disassociation of tight junction proteins63,64.
A prominent player in cytokine-mediated tight junction
regulation is myosin light chain kinase (MLCK)56,65,66,
which disrupts the interaction between the tight junction
proteins and the actin-myosin cytoskeleton, subsequently
damaging the tight junction scaffold, which is crucial for
the maintenance of barrier integrity66–68. TNF-mediated
endocytosis of the tight junction requires enhanced
MLCK transcription and activity at the tight junctions.
Cytokines are also responsible for occludin redistribution
from the tight junction to caveolin-containing vesicles69,
and MLCK is also involved in the regulation of tight
junction proteins through the alteration of ZO-1 protein
dynamics70.
Another major mechanism of tight junction regulation
is post-translational phosphorylation, which drastically
alters their membrane distribution and turnover. Among
the tight junction proteins, the post-translational phos￾phorylation of occludin has been widely studied and is
responsible for opening and sealing tight junctions71. The
phosphorylation status of occludin is intricately regulated
by several kinases. Various research groups have sug￾gested that serine/threonine phosphorylation is the pre￾dominant phosphorylation modification of occludin;
however, recent research advances in this area have
emphasized the importance of tyrosine phosphorylation.
Hence, kinases such as PKC and c-Src and phosphatases,
including PP2A, PP1, and PTP1B, which phosphorylate
and dephosphorylate occludin, have a crucial role to play
in intestinal barrier integrity72–74.
Occludin is highly phosphorylated at serine and threo￾nine residues in the basal epithelium72. The specific
kinases involved in occludin phosphorylation remain
elusive; however, cellular/tight junction localization stu￾dies have suggested PKC as one of the cardinal players.
Phosphorylated occludin interacts with ZO-1 and other
tight junction proteins. An alteration in the phosphor￾ylation pattern, such as an increase in tyrosine phos￾phorylation, which results from pathological conditions,
such as inflammation or elevated ROS, can alter the
protein–protein interactions of occludin with ZO-1, ZO￾2, and ZO-3, and thereby alter the membrane integrity75.
Oxidative-stress-induced intestinal permeability is
thought to be mediated through the tyrosine phosphor￾ylation of occludin and the redistribution of occludin, ZO￾1, E-cadherin, and β-catenin from the intracellular junc￾tions76,77. The tyrosine kinases involved in occludin
phosphorylation remain largely obscure, although certain
studies have speculated the role of c-Src family kinases in
hydrogen peroxide-induced occludin tyrosine phosphor￾ylation at the cellular level31,78. Tyrosine phosphorylated
occludin could delocalize/disassemble from the tight
junctions and undergo proteasome-mediated degradation,
a phenomenon observed in patients suffering from
inflammatory bowel syndrome79,80. The cellular energy
sensor, AMPK, has been implicated in tight junction
assembly by several studies81. AMPK is activated during
the calcium switch-induced assembly of ZO-1, which
facilitates tight junction assembly81. Butyrate, a short
chain fatty acid abundant in the gut after the bacterial
fermentation of carbohydrates, also induces tight junction
assembly of ZO-1 and occludin through an AMPK￾dependent pathway82. Although studies in this field have
elucidated some of the mechanisms of tight junction
regulation, in vivo studies that describe their role in
pathological conditions are lacking. Despite the dis￾coveries identifying the indisputable role of the post￾translational phosphorylation of tight junction proteins,
future studies to decipher the kinases and phosphatases
involved, in addition to the putative binding partners and
protein–protein interactions, are imperative for a better
understanding of their regulatory mechanisms.
Regulation of barrier integrity during pathological
conditions
The significance of the gut barrier in disease patho￾genesis has recently attracted attention. Compromised
intestinal barrier integrity is observed in both intestinal
and systemic diseases, including IBDs, autoimmune
diseases, and other metabolic diseases83. However, the
scientific community has not yet determined whether
the loss of barrier integrity is the cause or consequence
of these diseases. Pathophysiological or environmental
factors may be the crucial factors that usurp normal
physiology and increase the permeability of the barrier.
Hence, it is imperative to understand the factors that
contribute to the loss of barrier integrity under patholo￾gical conditions (Fig. 2).
Inflammatory bowel disease and ulcerative colitis
IBD is a group of conditions in which patients have
severe inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract84–86. It
is a chronic condition that affects one out of 250 people
in the European population as well as a significant
Chelakkot et al. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2018) 50:103 Page 4 of 9

population of people of other ethnic origins, and it has
an unknown etiology, poor prognosis, and lifelong
morbidity in patients87,88. There are two major classifi￾cations of IBD: ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease
(CD). In UC, the inflammation is restricted to the rectum
and the colon and never affects the small intestine;
in contrast, in CD, there can be severe inflammation in
any part of the intestine, including the small intestine
and the large intestine89. The mechanism and etiology
of disease progression are entirely different for these
two types of IBD. Genetic predisposition to the disease
is observed widely; in most cases, patients have at least
one or more members in the family with the disease.
Although the exact cause and mechanism of both types
of IBD are yet to be completely understood, environ￾mental or autoimmune-related factors are major causative
factors90,91. The dysregulation of the mucosal immune
response is also thought to be primarily responsible for
disease progression92,93.
The loss of barrier integrity is a characteristic feature
of IBD. A leaky gut may be an initial event in the
pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disorders, allowing
bacteria-derived molecules into the mucosa and flaring up
uncontrollable inflammatory signal cascades. The altered
expression of tight junction proteins is observed in
patients with UC and IBD94. Although there is an unre￾solved dispute over the contribution of the tight junction
barrier to the disease pathology, recent studies have
concluded that even in the presence of a normal under￾lying immunity, functional abnormalities of tight junction
proteins could result in these diseases. In patients with
CD, an increase in epithelial permeability precedes disease
relapse, which emphasizes the essential role of tight
junction proteins95,96. It has been reported that first￾degree relatives of patients with IBD have abnormal
intestinal permeability97, but it is still unclear whether
individuals are genetically pre-disposed to compromised
barrier integrity or if diet or environmental factors make
them susceptible to the disease. The increase in apoptosis
in IECs and cell shedding could also be responsible for the
leakiness observed in these patients. However, some
genetic studies have revealed a potential link between
mutations in TJ-associated proteins, such as myosin IXB
(MYO9B), partitioning defect protein (PARD3), PDZ
containing protein 2 gene (MAGI2), and the development
of IBD and celiac diseases98–100. All these studies rein￾force the important role played by tight junction proteins
and highlight the central role of epithelial barrier function
in the pathogenesis of IBD.
Studies on in vivo experimental and spontaneous colitis
models have identified the quintessential role played by
tight junction proteins in the pathogenesis of UC. The
roles of several kinases and proteins in the regulation of
tight junction protein expression in pathological condi￾tions were also investigated in these studies. Recently, it
was reported in an experimental colitis model that dex￾tran sodium sulfate (DSS) treatment, a chemical agent
known to induce colitis, elevated the c-Src-mediated
tyrosine phosphorylation of occludin in a phospholipase
D2 (PLD2)-mediated pathway in PLD2 knockout mice.

conditions affect barrier integrity directly or indirectly through changes in microbiota. Compromised barrier integrity leads to an immune response
and contributes to several pathological conditions

The inhibition of this pathway was shown to ameliorate
DSS-induced colitis101.
Obesity and metabolic disorders
The loss of barrier integrity is closely associated with the
onset of metabolic disorders, including obesity and type-II
diabetes (T2D). Clinical studies have shown that increased
intestinal permeability decreased to within the normal
range after weight reduction in patients with obesity102.
Recent studies have also demonstrated a difference in the
intestinal permeability between individuals with or with￾out T2D, which implicated a crucial contribution of
intestinal permeability to metabolic disorders103. How￾ever, further studies are necessary before the regulation of
barrier permeability can be introduced into clinical
practice104.
Metabolic endotoxemia, arising from the loss of barrier
integrity, is thought to be a major factor that contributes
to insulin resistance and obesity105–107. Damage to the
intestinal epithelial layer causes the leakage of gut
microbiota-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and other
toxins into the blood stream, resulting in metabolic
endotoxemia. Mice fed a high-fat diet for 4 weeks
showed a three- to fourfold increase in serum LPS,
which is defined as metabolic endotoxemia. This condi￾tion can subsequently lead to low-grade systemic
inflammation and insulin resistance that is central to
metabolic diseases. LPS itself is known to impact the
increase in gut permeability. Physiologically relevant LPS
concentrations (0–10 ng/ml) can induce intestinal tight
junction permeability in enterocytes via an increase in
TLR-4 and CD14 expression, without inducing cell
death108. As bacterial-derived LPS has a key role in the
increase in gut permeability, changes in the gut micro￾biota must be a contributory factor to the pathogenesis
of obesity and diabetes109.
Changes in the gut microbial composition are a char￾acteristic feature of many metabolic diseases; obese and
diabetic individuals show drastic differences in their gut
microbiomes compared with healthy counterparts, and
the gut microbiome plays a pivotal role in the main￾tenance of barrier integrity110–112. The two major bac￾terial phyla in the gut, Bacteriodetes and Firmicutes,
have been investigated widely for their effect on IECs.
Mice fed with an high fat diet (HFD), or patients with
obesity or diabetes show a change in this ratio with
elevated levels of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria compared
with the beneficial species, Bacteriodetes. Akkermansia
muciniphila is one such beneficial bacterial species known
to be less abundant in obese and diabetic individuals
and has been implicated in the regulation of intestinal
barrier integrity113. The daily administration of live
A. muciniphila has been shown to mitigate HFD￾induced gut barrier dysfunction114,115. Bacterial-derived
components have also been reported to directly affect
tight junction assembly. Plovier et al.116 recently identified
that a specific outer membrane protein of A. muciniphila,
termed Amuc100, improved the gut barrier integrity and
that administration of this protein alone could partly
recapitulate the beneficial effects shown by A. mucini￾phila. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted from bacteria
are other major components that are known to interact
directly with IECs and exert their function. EVs from A.
muciniphila have been shown to improve the symptoms
of DSS-induced colitis in mice117. Another study from our
group recently showed that EVs derived from A. muci￾niphila improved barrier integrity and glucose tolerance
and reduced body weight gain in HFD-fed mice (in press).
The reduction in metabolic endotoxemia through the
improvement of gut barrier permeability could therefore
present an interesting strategy to treat metabolic dis￾orders such as obesity and diabetes.
Future perspectives
Recent studies have provided substantial evidence for
the role of intestinal permeability in the regulation of
several intestinal and extra-intestinal diseases. The
improvement of barrier integrity by the regulation of
tight junction protein expression or through other
mechanisms has shown promising results with improve￾ment of the disease symptoms in UC, CD, and metabolic
diseases; strategies to identify and develop novel ther￾apeutic targets to improve gut barrier integrity have
become increasingly more attractive. The improvement
of gut barrier integrity alone might not be sufficient in
severe inflammatory diseases. However, in combination
with conventional immunosuppressant drugs, such as
TNFα inhibitors, approaches to improve intestinal barrier
might prove beneficial. Metagenomic studies on gut
microbiota from individuals with various diseases have
shown that gut microbiota also actively interact with
IECs for the regulation of barrier integrity. Various
research groups are also investigating the strategy of
probiotic and prebiotic administration to improve
intestinal barrier integrity, as well as metabolic diseases.
However, therapeutic intervention for the regulation
of barrier integrity is an emerging topic and more
investigations are essential to understand the role of
intestinal barrier integrity in various diseases. The eluci￾dation of signaling pathways involved in the regulation
of the tight junction would allow the identification of
novel barrier-restoring agents, which is imperative for
deciphering novel and potent approaches for disease
treatment.
