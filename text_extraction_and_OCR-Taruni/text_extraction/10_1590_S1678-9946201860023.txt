ABSTRACT
Leptospirosis is an acute bacterial septicemic febrile disease caused by pathogenic 
leptospires, which affect humans and animals in all parts of the world. Transmission can 
occur by direct contact with infected animals or, more commonly, through indirect contact 
with water or soil contaminated with urine from infected animals. Leptospires enter the 
body by penetrating mucous membranes or skin abrasions and disseminate through the 
hematogenic route. In humans, leptospirosis may cause a wide spectrum of symptoms. Most 
cases have a biphasic clinical presentation, which begins with the septicemic phase followed 
by immune manifestations. The severe forms of the disease may be life threatening with 
multisystem damage including renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, vascular damage, pulmonary 
hemorrhage and muscle lesions. In this review, we present and discuss the pathogenesis of 
the human disease and the mechanisms of cell membrane injuries, which occur mainly due 
to the presence of leptospires and/or their antigen/s in the host tissues.
KEYWORDS: Leptospira. Leptospirosis. Cadherins. Weil syndrome. Acute liver and 
kidney injury.
INTRODUCTION
Leptospirosis is an acute bacterial septicemic febrile disease caused by 
pathogenic species of Leptospira, which affect humans and animals in all parts of 
the world1
. It is a zoonosis associated with chronically infected carrier animals2
. In 
humans, leptospirosis has a biphasic clinical presentation, which begins with the 
septicemic phase followed by immune manifestations3
. The most severe form of the 
disease, with multisystem damage, including vascular, hepatic, renal, pulmonary 
and skeletal muscles injury, is known as the Weil syndrome4-7. Many cases of 
leptospirosis exhibit a non-specific picture of a febrile disease, however the vascular 
manifestation of the disease may be present as a hemorrhagic conjunctivitis3,8
. It 
has been estimated that the annual mortality rate of leptospirosis is 0.84 deaths per 
100,000 people, globally1
.
Pathogenic leptospires are widespread in nature and their life cycles keep them 
in the environment thanks to their hematogenous and intercellular dissemination 
to the proximal kidney tubules of the various reservoir hosts. Potential gateways 
to leptospire are usually skin abrasions and mucous membranes of the oral cavity 
and conjunctiva. Transmission may occur by direct contact with an infected host, 
but more commonly occurs via soil, from contaminated water where bacteria are 
known to persist, and from the urine of infected animals. Therefore, occupational 
activities involving infected animals and contaminated soil and water are risk

factors for developing leptospirosis3,9. Humans are 
accidental hosts, and commonly exhibit urinary shedding 
of leptospires for short durations3,9
. In the proximal tubules, 
the leptospires colonize the reservoir’s brush border over 
long periods, which does not produce apparent adverse 
effects in the reservoir host but acts to disseminate the 
microorganism10. However, we should remember that 
during human and animal infections, proximal tubules 
are the main site of important lesions, which determine 
the brush border of morphological and immunoenzymatic 
changes, among other alterations11. It should be expected 
that the presence of the microorganism in the reservoir 
host might be accompanied, at least in certain cases, by 
discrete pathophysiological manifestations. In this context, 
a study of asymptomatic renal colonization of humans 
by leptospires has shown that excretion of leptospires 
can occur for periods exceeding a year. Moreover, it was 
speculated that in regions with high disease transmission 
like the one studied, “humans can develop some clinical 
and serological characteristics of asymptomatic urinary 
carriers” as observed in reservoir hosts12.
An important study was carried out by RamachandraRao 
et al.
13 in rats, which are animal carrier hosts for leptospires. 
Both female and male rats were experimentally infected 
with leptospires and urine exosome analysis was carried out 
in the kidneys. Exosomes are nanovesicles that are released 
from cells and mediate intercellular communication14. 
Exosome analysis can identify important information 
related to kidney function such as the protein content 
of urine. It was found that the urine from infected rats 
showed a marked increase in protein content and many 
of the proteins were unique to the urine of infected male 
or female rats. Moreover, the top discriminator between 
control and infected rats was an alanyl aminopeptidase of 
membrane origin, also known as neutral aminopeptidase 
or CD13, expressed on the kidney brush border of the 
proximal tubules. Additionally, the Tamm-Horsfall protein, 
which is secreted by the transitional epithelium of the thick 
ascending Henle loop and distal tubules, was significantly 
decreased in the infected rat urine, suggesting a lesion in 
this part of the nephron.
Once inside the host, the hematogenous dissemination 
of leptospires through capillaries occurs and persists there 
during the septicemic phase of the disease, which lasts 
for the first eight days of fever15. Experimental studies 
of leptospirosis suggest that afterwards, leptospires find 
their way to the interstitium. This usually occurs either 
when the leptospires pass between endothelial cells, as 
suggested by a study in guinea pigs using colloidal carbon 
as capillary marker16 or after other kind of insult to the 
cell such as direct damage to the endothelial membrane. 
Additionally, leptospires can pass between epithelial cells, 
including the ones lining the renal tubules, and this could 
be an important way to reach and colonize the lumen of 
the proximal tubules. It is interesting to speculate about 
the interplay between leptospires and cell brush borders, 
where the microorganisms apparently find a relatively 
safe environment to persist for a long time. However, 
morphological lesions, such as the disappearance of the PAS 
(periodic acid–Schiff reaction) and alkaline phosphatase 
histochemical reactions, are present in this segment of the 
nephron during the infection, suggesting that the presence 
of the microorganism can damage the host during active 
disease11.
Liver cell plate disarray is a major histopathologic finding 
in human autopsies of leptospirosis, receiving attention 
since the early pathologic studies of the disease during the 
first World War (1914 - 1918)17,18. They are also present in 
experimental leptospirosis and are accompanied by antigen 
deposits over the cell membrane, as demonstrated by 
immunohistochemistry19 and immunoelectron microscopy20. 
Liver cell disarray is absent in human biopsies of leptospirosis 
cases when studied by light microscopy21,22. However, it 
must be remembered that since the biopsy procedure is only 
possible when the hemorrhagic phase of the disease subsides 
and patients are recovering, it is expected that at least some 
of the acute lesions are no longer present. In accordance with 
this, electron microscopy studies of human liver biopsies 
in leptospirosis show cellular junctions practically restored 
but with a few enlarged intercellular spaces21,23. Moreover, 
although most of the electron microscopy findings are non￾specific and might be related to the septicemic manifestations 
of the disease, the altered microvilli, both at the sinusoidal 
and the biliary pole, suggest a marked cell membrane 
disturbance. It was speculated at the time that the damage 
to cell membranes could be the result of hypothetical toxins 
produced by pathogenic leptospires, since it has been shown 
that leptospires have genes encoding for proteases and other 
products that can cause host cell membrane degradation24,25. 
CADHERINS
Our previous autopsy work on human leptospirosis26
has shown the importance of loss of E-cadherin membrane 
expression in the pathogenesis of liver plate disarray. 
E-cadherin is a 120 kDa glycoprotein that is highly 
expressed during development and is the predominant 
cadherin of the liver epithelium, where it is concentrated 
in the adherens junction and interacts with the actin 
filaments of the cell. This duality, including an extracellular 
domain that mediates cell-cell adhesion interactions and 
a cytoplasmic tail associated with catenins, and therefore

with the cytoskeleton, produces its fundamental roles in 
the organization and maintenance of the cell junction. In 
leptospirosis, the expression of E-cadherin in liver cells 
is diminished and/or absent in areas of the lobule, thus 
contributing to the lack of a stable intercellular adhesion 
(Figures 1A and 1B). Human biopsy studies of the liver in 
leptospirosis demonstrate a robust recovery of E-cadherin 
expression in the liver, since, as noted earlier, biopsy is 
possible only during the recovery phase of the disease 
(Figures 1C and 1D). Moreover, the definite signs of 
hepatocyte regeneration demonstrate an important previous 
insult to the liver during the acute stage of the disease. The 
data corroborate, as previously noted (De Brito et al.)5
, 
leptospirosis as a disease of the cell membrane.

Leptospirosis can also be regarded as a hemorrhagic 
septicemia, therefore, the main findings involving vessels, 
chiefly those of the microcirculatory circulation, are 
essential for its pathogenesis.
Evangelista et al.27,28 focused their work on vascular 
VE-cadherin, a major component of endothelial adherence 
junctions, which maintains vascular integrity, and found 
that pathogenic leptospires bind to endothelial cells lining 
blood vessels and to VE-cadherin of human mammalian 
cell culture. The binding of bacteria was reduced in the 
presence of antibodies against VE-cadherin, supporting 
the importance of this surface protein in the integrity of 
the endothelium. Non-pathogenic leptospires such as L. 
biflexa were less efficient, compared with L. interrogans, 
in attaching to endothelia and to fibronectin. The binding 
of pathogenic leptospires to host cells through receptors, 
such as cadherins, is not followed by a definite intracellular 
invasion. However, experimental and autopsy data suggest 
an altered cell membrane permeability16,26 with the presence 
of leptospira remnants and/or antigens in the cytoplasm and 
even in the nuclei of endothelial and human hepatic cells.
Therefore, VE-cadherin is a quite important previously 
identified receptor for pathogenic leptospires. The binding 
of bacteria to VE-cadherin is mediated by adhesins, proteins 
and lipoproteins, which have been identified in sera from 
leptospirosis patients27,28.
Martinez-Lopez et al.
29 demonstrated that pathogenic 
strains of Leptospira did not cause apoptosis or necrosis 
of the cells even after prolonged incubation periods, but 
significantly disrupted the endothelial cell layers, which 
may be interpreted as a main contributor to the hemorrhagic 
manifestations of the disease.
Our previous observations, using CD3430 and now 
VE‑cadherin31 immunohistochemical detection in the 
pulmonary circulation of autopsied patients who manifested 
marked pulmonary hemorrhage, showed morphological 
alterations which, particularly in the case of VE-cadherin, can 
explain the increased vascular permeability seen in conditions 
affecting the adherens junction organization31,32. As previously 
noted30, the hemorrhage is due to a non-inflammatory 
vasculopathy. VE-cadherin immunohistochemical detection 
shows disruption of endothelial cell-cell junctions, cell 
retraction and the consequent opening of intercellular gaps, 
thereby explaining the marked increase in paracellular 
permeability that is responsible for both pulmonary edema 
and hemorrhage (Figures 1E and 1F and Figures 2A and 
2B). Areas of capillary dilation are present and there is 
an irregular expression of CD34 in capillary walls by 
immunohistochemistry. As expected, the findings are in 
accordance with the marked clinical manifestations of acute 
pulmonary failure.
A recent study by Sato and Coburn33 showed that the 
most important finding seen in L. interrogans was the 
disruption of adherens junctions due to protein alterations. 
VE-cadherins, p120 catenin, alpha and beta catenins 
are specifically involved in the process. In contrast to 
the disturbance of the adherens junction, there were no 
changes in the tight junctional transmembrane, except for 
mislocalization of ZO-1. Moreover, infection by leptospires 
altered other host proteins of different classes.
H o w e v e r , V E - c a d h e r i n d e t e c t e d b y 
immunohistochemistry is not the only component of 
the endothelial cells of the microcirculation involved in 
the altered vascular permeability seen in leptospirosis. 
The immunohistochemical detection of endothelial 
transmembrane glycoproteins by CD3434, which also 
plays a role in cell adhesion, showed a reduction of focal 
expression in the capillaries of the lung microcirculation. 
Gaps of different sizes were present, which were interpreted 
either as sections of twisted dilated capillaries or disrupted 
cell junctions30. Moreover, an increased reactive expression 
of vascular intercellular adhesion molecules and Toll-like 
receptor was found in the lungs of leptospirosis cases35.
Recently, glycocalyx, another important component of 
the endothelium, was found to be damaged in a study of 
acute kidney injury in human leptospirosis36. Glycocalyx has 
antiadhesive and anticoagulant properties that are essential 
for the endothelium to maintain the barrier function. In this 
study, leptospirosis was found to be associated with higher 
levels of intercellular adhesion molecules, particularly 
ICAM-1 and syndecan-136.
Taking the above data together, we suggest that the 
endothelial cell is injured in leptospirosis, and this includes 
not only the main important lesion at the adherens junction 
but also alterations of the cell membrane, leading to altered 
permeability. 
The lung in leptospirosis showed a surprising amount 
of preservation of the immunohistochemical phenotype 
for cells of the alveolar lining, including those in areas 
of edema and hemorrhage30. Usually, rare cell necrosis 
and/or no definite cell necrosis was observed. Connexin 
43 expression seen in the epithelial cells inside areas of 
edema and hemorrhage might be interpreted as evidence of 
cytoplasmic communication between less damaged cells. 
This finding suggests previous cell disarray, as observed 
in other organs such as the liver, and therefore strengthens 
the possibility of a predominant lesion of the cell adherens 
junction, thus following a common pattern of cell membrane 
lesion. In addition, the immunohistochemical aspects of 
VE‑cadherin detection, which mediates the paracellular 
pathway of endothelial permeability in the pulmonary 
capillaries, is in accordance with a similar pathogenesis.

MUSCULAR LESIONS
Even though this broad approach to the pathogenesis of 
aspects of the disease does not apply to muscular lesions in 
leptospirosis, the most severely involved skeletal muscles 
are those of the calf, pectoral muscles may also be, although 
less frequently, damaged37. As seen microscopically, 
the process selects isolated or small groups of muscle 
fibers, which may exhibit loss of striation, and round 
lumps of hyaline material, interpreted as isolated muscle 
fiber necrosis. A peripheral inflammatory infiltrate made 
up mostly of mononuclear cells was seen close to the 
damaged muscle fiber. Leptospira antigens were detected by 
immunohistochemistry, particularly in the macrophages but 
also occasionally inside the muscle as granular deposits38.
Recently, it was also shown, in normal guinea pigs 
that Lp25, a surface protein of pathogenic leptospires, 
was partially responsible for hyperkalemic pre-renal acute 
kidney manifestations induced by rhabdomyolysis39. 
Pathology demonstrated in this experiment, that there is no 
wide range of muscle fiber sizes nor small or large groups 
of atrophic or hypertrophic fibers. Internal sarcolemma 
nuclei were not detected in isolated muscle fibers. However, 
focal muscle lesions were present, ranging from hyaline 
cytoplasmic changes, which may progress to excessive 
hypercontraction of isolated fibers and necrosis prior to 
phagocytosis, or to intermediate damage characterized by 
staining changes of myofibrils, producing pale necrotic 
cells (“ghost” cells), which can be demonstrated by usual 
staining, but chiefly by the Gomori trichrome dye. Small 
vacuoles might be detected in muscle fibers near irregular 
areas of muscle necrosis, which are the result of these 
changes. Mild inflammatory infiltrates, made up mostly 
of macrophages, may be found around this group of cells.

deposits delineating partially isolated myocyte membranes 
and occasionally spreading to the cytoplasm below. The 
inflammatory infiltrate, which is important in human 
muscular disease40, was usually discrete and was made up 
mostly of small groups of monocytes. These monocytes 
were present as focal isolated interstitial groups or as a part 
of small groups of isolated muscle fibers, frequently with 
antigenic linear deposits partially circumscribing muscle 
fibers or even inside their cytoplasms. Rarely, when the 
inflammatory infiltrate was more conspicuous, cytoplasmic 
antigenic granules were detected also in the mononuclear 
phagocytic cells.
The subsurface lipoprotein LipL32, which is abundant 
in pathogenic leptospires, was not initially considered 
important for the pathogenesis of the skeletal muscle 
lesions. However, LipL32 causes similar, but apparently 
less frequent, focal muscle lesions, characterized chiefly 
by small linear areas of necrosis. The focal isolated muscle 
lesions, as described after Lp25 administration, were less 
frequent when LipL32 was used. Immunohistochemistry 
with rabbit anti LipL32 was positive in isolated muscle 
fibers. Scarce mononuclear inflammatory interstitial 
reactions close to the damaged muscle were also present. In 
summary, both LipL32 and Lp25 can induce skeletal muscle 
damage, but lesions after Lp25 administration appear to be 
more diffuse and more accentuated than those seen with 
LipL32, in accordance with the pathophysiological findings 
described in the experiment39. 
The human skeletal muscle disease showed more 
accentuated findings, but also as seen in the experimental 
design, Lp25 was demonstrated over the muscle cell 
membrane and in the underlying cytoplasm. The focal 
inflammatory infiltrate was more marked when compared 
to the experimental results, but again was made up mostly 
of mononuclear cells. Antigens were demonstrated not only 
in phagocytic cells but also in the muscle sarcoplasm39. 
However, it is necessary to note that in this instance, we are 
dealing with patients with leptospirosis, and the immune 
serum can also recognize the microorganism antigens 
which, as previously demonstrated38, may be present in 
the muscle.
LIVER IN LEPTOSPIROSIS
It is well known that the most severe form of 
leptospirosis, the Weil’s disease, is mainly characterized 
by hemorrhage, hepatic and renal manifestations3
. Jaundice 
is an important manifestation of hepatic dysfunction, but 
its mechanism in leptospirosis remains not completely 
elucidated. Serum biochemical studies have demonstrated 
that the concentrations of transaminases and to a lesser 
degree of alkaline phosphatase, are moderately increased 
in human leptospirosis. Jaundice is mainly due to increased 
conjugated bilirubin and disturbances of bile excretion with 
intrahepatic cholestasis, which appeared at the time to be 
its main cause.
Previous observations in patients recovering from 
leptospirosis, therefore out of the hemorrhagic phase of 
the disease, showed a non-specific hepatocellular damage 
affecting the sinusoidal pole, endoplasmic reticulum, 
mitochondria and the bile secretory apparatus21,23. 
The sinusoidal pole showed altered microvilli, and the 
intercellular spaces were frequently widened with secondary 
microvilli and bile canaliculi dilated with microvilli 
partially or completely absent. Tight junctions were usually, 
but not always preserved. Golgi complexes might disclose 
dilated vesicles with an electron dense material inside. 
Hepatocytes showed glycogen depletion, microbodies 
and, in more severe cases, a predominance of the smooth 
endoplasmic reticulum. Mitochondrial alterations were 
present, correlating with a histochemical low demonstration 
of respiratory enzymes, probably related to the previous 
hemorrhagic phase of the disease. Remnants of leptospires, 
and probably bile pigment, were inside the widened 
intercellular spaces, between the hepatocytes. It is worth 
mentioning that, in guinea pigs, seemingly intact leptospires 
were seen by electron microscopy in the intercellular space 
between the hepatocytes in the experimental disease, 
sometimes close to the cell junctions11.
Therefore, cholestasis in leptospirosis was interpreted, 
at the time, as the result of disturbances to the bile secretory 
apparatus, which comprises the smooth endoplasmic 
reticulum, Golgi apparatus and biliary capillaries. Unknown 
factors, among them a currently hypothetical circulating 
toxin (or toxins), along with cell membrane damage, 
were thought to explain the pathological findings. These 
pathological findings include the presence of possible 
biliary products in the widened intercellular spaces, 
which exhibited microvilli on their surfaces, suggesting 
an abnormal paracellular conjugated bile excretory route 
through the altered cell membrane23.
Recent report from Miyhara et al.
41 in a hamster model 
of experimental leptospirosis proposes the destruction of 
the hepatocytic intercellular junction directly by leptospire 
intercellular migration, as cause of jaundice in the disease. 
Using scanning electron microscopy together with freeze￾cracking and cross-cutting methods for liver samples, 
three-dimensional images were obtained. Leptospires were 
found to migrate from the sinusoids to the biliary capillaries 
after disruption of the cellular junctions. Bile leaks from 
the biliary capillaries to the blood circulation during the 
induction of jaundice. This is a novel mechanism of jaundice

caused by leptospiral infection, based on a previous electron 
microscopy study of the liver in a hamster experimental 
model of leptospirosis42.
The mechanism of jaundice proposed by Miyhara et 
al.
41 is supported by the electron microscopy finding for 
leptospires and/or their remnants in the intercellular spaces 
of hepatocytes in humans23, and particularly in guinea pigs 
experimental disease11.
However, despite the electron microscopy findings 
showing that human and experimental leptospirosis is 
non-specific and differs only in degree from findings 
associated with viral hepatitis23, they show the importance 
of altered hepatocyte transport and chiefly the excretion of 
bile in leptospirosis. Most likely, both mechanisms are at 
work in the pathogenesis of jaundice in leptospirosis, but 
the mechanism suggested by Miyhara et al.41 has strong 
experimental support and is in accordance with leptospirosis 
being a disease with important cell membrane damage.
A biopsy study of the liver in leptospirosis during 
recovery21 showed that the liver architecture is preserved but 
infrequent mitotic figures are present in hepatocytes, along 
with multinucleation and hepatic cells with acidophilic 
cytoplasm suggesting apoptosis, and even the presence of 
occasional Councilman-like corpuscles. Observations on 
the repair of the E-cadherin showed a robust proliferation of 
fibers and the presence of frequent binucleated hepatocytes 
with variations in size and shape. This shows the importance 
of a previous general hepatocyte injury in leptospirosis, 
which cannot be neglected when the pathogenesis of 
jaundice is discussed.
KIDNEY IN LEPTOSPIROSIS
The kidney is a common target organ in leptospirosis, 
and tubule-interstitial nephritis is the most common 
clinical and pathological manifestation. Clinically, non￾oliguric acute kidney injury with hypokalemia, sodium 
and magnesium wasting frequently occurs in human 
leptospirosis. Immunohistochemical exams in autopsy 
material43 confirmed a primary lesion of the proximal 
convoluted tubules when a decrease of the endogenous 
sodium/hydrogen exchanger isoform 3 (NH3), aquaporin 1 
and 2 and α-Na+ K+ ATPase are found. Sodium and 
water transport were particularly affected with increased 
distal potassium excretion and consequent hypokalemia 
and polyuria. Previous electron microscopy results also 
showed definite lesions, chiefly of the brush border of 
the convoluted proximal tubules, both in the human 
disease44 and in experimental infection of guinea pigs11. 
Glomeruli, both in humans and experimental models, 
showed few alterations, usually manifested by areas of foot 
processes fusion, focal swelling of the basal membrane 
and endothelial cells. VE-cadherin immunohistochemical 
expression in glomerular capillaries was diminished and 
even focally absent (Figures 2C and 2D). VE-cadherin is 
part of the slit diaphragm protein complex of the glomerular 
podocytes, which are composed of proteins common to 
most cell-cell junctions. The possible role of VE-cadherin 
for the functional renal filtration barrier in the podocyte is 
so far unknown45. These glomerular alterations might be 
related to the proteinuria observed in a few leptospirosis 
patients46. Mesangial cell hypertrophy, also focally detected, 
is a non-specific reactive manifestation commonly seen in 
septicemias.
OTHER MANIFESTATIONS OF LEPTOSPIROSIS
Leptospirosis is a septicemic disease and manifestations 
such as leptomeningitis and myocarditis are expected during 
the disease. Myocarditis in leptospirosis was reported 
initially by Arean in 1957 in 61.5% of the hearts studied47. 
Our data48 found myocarditis in 50% of the hearts, a figure 
close to the one previously reported. The pathological 
findings were essentially the same as the ones reported by 
Arean47,49, except that we detected the involvement of the 
conductive system of the heart in our cases, which might 
be clinically relevant.
Vascular injury is present in the heart in leptospirosis 
and usually characterized by segmental lesions in on the 
walls of the coronary artery and their branches. Deposits 
of leptospiral antigens are usually revealed across groups 
of endothelial cells. Small intramyocardial branches might 
present subintimal edema and a perivascular non-specific 
inflammatory infiltrate, usually consisting of mononuclear 
cells. Occasionally, a peculiar mononuclear focal response 
of Anitchkow-like cells, resembling Aschoff bodies of 
rheumatic fever, was described by Arean47 close to the 
medium-sized coronary branches. They were also seen by 
us both in humans and in experimental animals48.
Another interesting vascular lesion seen in leptospirosis 
is aortitis, found in 57.8% of cases48. First described by 
Arean49, it resembles syphilitic aortitis but, unlike syphilis, 
the vasa vasorum fail to show obstructive vasculitis and 
there are no changes in the aortic media other than the 
extension of adventitial inflammation. 
Therefore, we suggest that the most common and 
important lesion in leptospirosis is the vascular damage, 
which affects the endothelial cell as a whole. Moreover, 
the altered adhesion between endothelial cells is quite 
important. It is mediated chiefly by VE-cadherin but also 
by CD34 and other endothelial cell components, which 
permits endothelial permeability with massive loss of

blood. Immunohistochemical studies, when demonstrating 
alterations to the glycoproteins of the endothelial 
cells membrane, add transcellular permeability to the 
hemorrhagic manifestations of the disease. 
Leptospires and their antigens are frequently in close 
contact with the cell membrane and it has been demonstrated 
that the leptospire can penetrate the cell. Their antigens can 
be found in the cytoplasm, and rarely, inside the nucleus5
.
Recently, a leptospiral lipase was characterized (Abreu 
et al., unpublished results) and its immunohistochemistry 
on hepatocytes from human autopsies showed a definite 
presence of the enzyme in the cell membrane in leptospirosis. 
Lipase is probably secreted by leptospires during cell 
adhesion and is probably important in the pathogenesis of 
cellular disruption, as seen chiefly in the liver and possibly 
in other organs during leptospiral infection. 
Deposits of leptospiral antigen (or antigens) on the 
host cell membrane and the loss and/or alteration of 
cadherin expression might corroborate suggestions that cell 
membrane damage is the primary lesion in leptospirosis, 
which is mediated by unknown factors, among them 
glycol and/or lipoproteins of the leptospiral surface. 
Vinh et al.50 suggested that the adherence of leptospires 
and/or their products might lead the intercalation of the 
microorganism’s fatty acids into the cell membrane. We 
may, however, provide an alternative to Vinh’s speculation 
and consider that the major carbon and energy sources 
of leptospires are long-chain fatty acids derived chiefly 
from beta-oxidation. Therefore, the adherence to the cell 
membrane is a mechanism to fulfill the microorganism’s 
energy requirements, which would be provided by the cell 
membrane fatty acids5
.
Therefore, the general pattern of altered cell adhesion 
with partial or total disappearance of cadherins is also 
present in microcirculatory vessels.
In the context of a definite lesion of the cell membrane, 
the pathogenesis of the muscular damage, as seen chiefly 
in the experimental work, suggests a toxin-like action of a 
protein from the subsurface of the leptospiral membrane as 
an important factor in the mechanism of the disease. 
CONCLUSIONS
In summary, the primary lesion in leptospirosis seems 
to be the cell membrane damage mediated by unknown 
factors, possibly leptospiral proteins and/or toxic cellular 
components. Injuries to the cell membrane may result in 
severe consequences to the host, such as loss of vascular 
integrity, ischemia and necrosis, leading to significant organ 
dysfunctions. Understanding the molecular mechanisms 
involved in the pathogenesis and pathology of leptospirosis 
is of utmost importance for prognostic and therapeutic 
applications.
