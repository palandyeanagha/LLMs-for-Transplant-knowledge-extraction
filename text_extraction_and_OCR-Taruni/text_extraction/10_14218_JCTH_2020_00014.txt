Abstract
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a hepatic mani￾festation of metabolic syndrome. The spread of obesity
worldwide in pandemic proportions has led to a rapid rise of
NAFLD in developed and developing countries alike. There are
no approved pharmacological agents to treat steatohepatitis
or advanced fibrosis but obeticholic acid recently has shown
some promise in phase III trial. Currently, NAFLD is the
number one etiology for simultaneous liver and kidney trans￾plantation in the USA, second most common indication for
liver transplantation (LT) and projected to become number
one very soon. LT for NAFLD poses unique challenges, as
these patients are generally older, obese and more likely to
have a number of metabolic risk factors. Bariatric surgery is
an option and can be considered if a structured weight loss
program does not achieve the sustained weight loss goal.
Comprehensive cardiovascular risk assessment and aggres￾sive management of comorbid conditions are crucial in the LT
evaluation process to improve post-transplant survival. Re￾current nonalcoholic steatohepatitis after LT is not uncom￾mon, and thus warrants primary and secondary prevention
strategies through a multidisciplinary approach. Prevalence of
NAFLD in a donor population is a unique and growing concern
that limits the access to quality liver grafts.

Introduction
Recent advances in chronic hepatitis B and C therapies,
combined with increasing prevalence of the obesity epidemic
and of other metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes
mellitus (T2DM) and hyperlipidemia, have led to a dramatic
rise in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Today, NAFLD
is a major global health problem and has emerged as the 2nd
most common indication for liver transplantation (LT) in the
USA, and is projected to become number one soon.1 NAFLD is
a spectrum of liver disease that includes two major types:
nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), when there is steatosis, and
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), when there is significant
inflammation. Because of sedentary lifestyle and poor dietary
habits, combined with advancing age, prevalence of NAFL and
its progression to NASH cirrhosis, liver failure, and HCC, and
ultimately the need for LT, are continuing to rise.
While LT is curative and has been shown to improve
survival of patients with advanced liver disease of any
etiology, there are unique challenges in NASH patients.
First, there is no effective pharmacotherapy currently avail￾able to halt progression of NASH to advanced fibrosis stages,
unlike viral hepatitis. Second, NASH patients are often older,
obese and have numerous comorbidities compared to those
with other chronic liver disease (CLD) etiologies, thus increas￾ing the risk of mortality during and after LT. Third, increased
prevalence of NAFLD in the donor population may adversely
affect the availability and quality of liver grafts in future.
Finally, recurrent NASH after LT in recipients can negatively
affect graft and patient survival. In this evolving landscape,
the purpose of this review is to discuss the burden of NAFLD,
its risk factors, and its implications on LT.
Epidemiology of NAFLD
As noted previously, due to the growing obesity epidemic now
affecting more than 1.9 billion adults globally, NAFLD has
become one of the leading causes of CLD.2 According to
recent estimates, NAFLD affects as many as one billion indi￾viduals throughout the world. Similarly, in the USA, NAFLD
affects nearly 80-100 million individuals, making it the
number one etiology of CLD.3 Nearly 25% of patients with

NAFL progress to NASH; however, the true prevalence of
biopsy-proven NASH is difficult to determine, as the majority
of NAFL patients do not undergo biopsy. Although the preva￾lence of NAFLD is increasing throughout the world, there
appears to be a significant geographical variation. Overall
global prevalence of NAFLD is reported to be 25.2%, accord￾ing to a recent meta-analysis, with the highest rates being in
the Middle East (32%) and South America (31%) and the
lowest in Africa (14%).4 The prevalence is 27% in Asia, fol￾lowed by 24% in North America, and 23% in Europe.
The prevalence of NASH in the general population is
estimated to be in the range of 1.5% and 6.45%.2 However,
the true prevalence of NASH is difficult to ascertain, primarily
because of inaccuracies of diagnostic modalities used. Ultra￾sound fails to identify the mild form of liver steatosis; up to
50-80% of patients with NAFLD may have normal liver
enzymes, and the gold standard liver biopsy suffers consid￾erable sampling error.5 Nevertheless, if the current trend con￾tinues, the future burden of NASH and its related
complications are only going to rise astronomically. Novel
methodologies used in modeling studies have given a
glimpse into future projections. For example, in a modeling
study utilizing obesity (by body mass index) and incidence of
T2DM in eight countries, involving approximately one-quarter
of the world’s population, Estes and colleagues6 estimated a
significant rise in NASH and related complications by 2030.
Specifically, they reported a 63% increase in NASH preva￾lence, 168% increase in incidence of decompensated NASH
cirrhosis, 137% increase in hepatocellular carcinoma inci￾dence, and 178% increase in liver-related death, with
overall number of deaths as high as 800,000. Figure 1 sum￾marizes the natural history and progression of NAFL/NASH to
related CLD, LT and recurrent NAFL/NASH.
Risk factors of NAFLD
It is very well established that T2DM, obesity and related
metabolic syndrome (hyperlipidemia, increased waist circum￾ference, hypertension) play a major role in the pathogenesis
of NAFLD. According to a large systematic review, involving
222,816 diabetic patients from 25 countries, the NAFLD
prevalence in T2DM patients is as high as 61.1%.7 Similarly,
the prevalence of NASH and advanced fibrosis ($F3) in biop￾sied diabetic patients was reported as 64% and 10.4%
respectively.7,8 NAFLD prevalence increases with increasing
body mass index8 and it is estimated that 95% of morbidly
obese patients undergoing weight-loss surgery have NAFLD.9
As the rates of obesity amongst children have risen from
5.0% in 1960 to 16.9% in 2010, NAFLD is increasingly diag￾nosed in children and adolescents.10
Among the non-modifiable risk factors, age, sex and
ethnicity are implicated in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. In
the USA, NAFLD is most prevalent in Hispanic Americans,
followed by non-Hispanic Whites, and is least common in
African Americans.11 According to population studies, NAFLD
is more common in males and prevalence increases with age.
NAFLD also causes substantial economic impact due to health
care dollar spending. The 10-year burden of NAFLD is esti￾mated to reach more than 1 trillion dollars in the USA alone.
In Europe, the 10-year burden is expected to reach 334 billion
euros.10
NASH as an indication for LT
As already noted, NAFLD is now the most common cause of
CLD in the USA and Europe and is continuing to rise world￾wide.10 Among the top indications for LT in the USA, based on
the United Network for Organ sharing (UNOS) data from
2003-2014, NASH experienced the highest rate of increase
(162%) compared to alcohol (55%) and hepatitis C virus
(HCV) (33%).12 Subsequently in 2013, NASH became the
2nd leading indication for LT in the USA.1 In the same year,
the advent of direct acting antiviral agents, a highly effective
and safer type of medications, has led to dramatic reduction
in chronic HCV disease burden and rates of LT. The decline of
HCV prevalence, combined with recent resurgence of alcohol￾ism, has resulted in alcoholic liver disease (ALD) to become
the number one cause for LT in the USA, surpassing HCV.13
However, this trend is not expected to last very long, as
NASH, with its current trajectory, is expected to replace ALD
and become the leading indication very soon.
Although NASH patients undergoing LT are older and obese
compared to those with other etiologies, studies have dem￾onstrated that the short-term and long-term post-transplant
survival rates are very similar. For example, 1- and 3-year
post-transplant survival rates for NASH LT recipients were
84% and 78% compared to 87% and 78% (p=0.67) for other
indications (HCV, ALD, and cholestatic and autoimmune hep￾atitis). In addition, the 3-year graft survival rate was 76% for
NASH LT recipients.14 In another study, the 5-year survival of
LT recipients for NASH was superior to those with HCV
(77.81% vs. 72.15%).12 More recently, in a retrospective
study of 26,121 LT recipients with HCC from 2002-2016,
NASH patients were older (mean age of 62.9 years) com￾pared to those with HCV (59.2 years), HBV (57.2 years) and
ALD (60.6 years), obese (body mass index of >30, NASH
60.5% vs. HCV 32.9%, HBV 14.4% and ALD 40%) and
more likely to be diabetic (NASH 60.3% vs. HCV 22.5%,
HBV 19.3% and ALD 32.7%). The 1-year post-transplant sur￾vival rate was similar across all cohorts (p>0.5) but long-term
mortality and graft loss were highest in HCV and lowest in
HBV.15
Although HCV has remained as the most common cause of
HCC in LT candidates, NASH was the most rapidly growing
cause, with 11.8-fold increase from 2002 to 2016. Figures 2
and 3 demonstrate the temporal trends of annual waitlist
additions and LT rates in the USA from 2008-2018 for the
top 5 etiologies of CLD based on the most recent UNOS
data. These graphs demonstrate a steady and upward trend
for NASH-related LT in the USA.

Strategies to prevent progression of NAFL/NASH
T2DM, insulin resistance, obesity and other metabolic risk
factors are the main factors driving the prevalence of NAFLD
and remain the primary targets in its prevention and pro￾gression. Lifestyle modifications, such as exercise and a
healthy diet, resulting in sustained weight loss are the only
proven and effective strategies available currently to curtail
the NAFL/NASH burden.2 NAFLD is considered to be the
hepatic manifestation metabolic syndrome. Approximately
70% of patients with T2DM have NAFLD and these diseases
share common pathophysiological pathways.
Antidiabetic drugs, as well as statins, can improve bio￾chemical and histological features of NAFL/NASH.16 Manage￾ment of comorbidities is not only critical in decreasing
progression of NASH but is also pivotal in decreasing cardio￾vascular mortality, which is the major cause of death in these
patients. While weight loss is the single most effective inter￾vention, it can be extremely challenging for patients to
achieve the sustained weight loss goal. Structured weight
management programs with a multidisciplinary team have
had variable success. In morbidly obese patients, who are
less likely to be considered for LT surgery, bariatric surgery
may be necessary and has not shown to have any negative
impact on the LT outcomes.17 Additionally, bariatric surgery
improves and sometimes eliminates other comorbid condi￾tions in many patients and has shown to improve long-term
survival from the two most common causes of death in
NAFLD, malignancy and cardiovascular disease (CVD).18
Recent advances in pharmacotherapy
The two primary endpoints of numerous ongoing clinical trials
are resolution of steatohepatitis and improvement in liver
fibrosis or both, which are considered surrogate markers for
slowing the progression of NASH. Despite the vast knowledge
of risk factors and clear elucidation of pathophysiologic path￾ways in NASH, there has been no significant breakthrough in
disease-specific pharmacotherapy yet. However, recent
studies have shown some promise. Obeticholic acid, which
is already approved for primary biliary cholangitis, is currently
under review by the national Federal Drug Administration and
could potentially be the first approved medication for NASH.
In recent interim analysis of the REGENERATE trial, a phase
III multicenter, randomized placebo-controlled study, biopsy￾proven NASH patients with F1-F3 fibrosis, treatment with
obeticholic acid at 25 mg a day has reached the primary end
point of improvement in liver fibrosis score by $ 1 stage
without worsening of NASH at 18 months follow-up compared
to placebo (23% vs. 12%, p=0.0002).19
A number of other agents, such as cenicriviroc, elafibranor,
aramchol and resmetirom, are in the pipeline with phase III
trials. Primary end points are fibrosis improvement and
prevention of worsening of NASH for cenicriviroc and NASH
resolution and prevention of progression fibrosis for elafibri￾nor.20 Elafibranor with its favorable safety profile and toler￾ability makes an attractive choice, but the phase III results of
the RESOLVE-IT trial are delayed. Cenicriviroc’s phase IIb
results were promising, but poor preliminary efficacy results
cast doubt over the success of the ongoing AURORA phase III
trial.21 The strong safety and efficacy found in a phase II trial
as well as in preliminary results of the phase III MAESTRO￾NASH trial has made resmetirom a hopeful alternative.22
Finally, early results of aramchol are inconsistent but phase
III trial is in progress.
Special considerations of NASH in LT
NASH is a multisystem disease associated, with clinical
manifestations beyond the liver. NASH patients are at higher
risk of mortality and morbidity due to increased prevalence of
metabolic comorbidities. Importantly, CVD and malignancies
contribute to higher mortality in NASH patients than liver￾related morality (cirrhosis and HCC).23 These factors should
be considered in the LT evaluation process.
Cardiovascular risk assessment and management in LT
NASH independently contributes to increased cardiovascular
mortality and morbidity, regardless of other cardiovascular
risk factors. In addition to coronary artery disease, several
other cardiovascular complications are reported in NAFLD
patients, such as premature atherosclerosis to left ventricular
dysfunction and hypertrophy, aortic sclerosis, congestive
heart failure, and cardiac arrythmias (atrial fibrillation and
prolonged QTc).24 Based on the recent meta-analysis by
Targher et al.,
25 including 34000 patients, presence of
NAFLD is associated with 65% increase in fatal and non￾fatal cardiovascular events at medial 7-year follow-up
period. LT surgery is inherently stressful to the heart
because of sudden changes in hemodynamic parameters
and furthermore, post-operative complications can unmask
underlying clinically silent CVD leading to poor outcomes
and increased mortality.26 Compared to other etiologies,
post-transplant cardiovascular events are higher in LT recipi￾ents with NASH cirrhosis, especially in the immediate post￾operative period.27 Therefore, several societies recommend
comprehensive cardiovascular risk assessment and testing
during the LT evaluation process.
While it is important to thoroughly evaluate these patients,
it is unclear what constitutes comprehensive cardiovascular
evaluation and that itself varies significantly across the LT
centers. However, the general approach should focus on
identifying underlying CVD, congestive heart failure and
portopulmonary hypertension, and optimize these conditions
prior to LT surgery and exclude high-risk patients. Patients
with clinically significant congestive heart failure should be
excluded from LT due to the risk of decompensation and
death. High-risk patients with coronary artery disease should

either undergo revascularization before transplant surgery or
be excluded from the waitlist.28 Additionally, patients with
moderate to severe portopulmonary hypertension who fail
to respond to vasodilator therapy are considered high-risk
and should be excluded from LT.29
Both structural and functional cardiac evaluation is
required in LT candidates. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing
is challenging because cirrhotic patients may be decondi￾tioned with poor performance status, ascites, malnutrition,
and frailty. Doppler echocardiography is routinely performed
to assess left and right ventricular and valvular function and
to screen for pulmonary hypertension. Noninvasive stress
testing is performed using dobutamine stress echocardio￾gram or myocardial perfusion imaging, and if abnormal,
further evaluation with cardiac catheterization may be
required. Although, dobutamine stress echocardiogram has
shown to be a good noninvasive test to evaluate coronary
ischemia in the general population, it suffers from poor
sensitivity in cirrhotic patients due to difficulty in achieving
target heart rate and double product, perhaps due to use of
betablockers for variceal prophylaxis in many patients.30
Because of these limitations, several centers routinely
perform right and left heart catheterization as a part of trans￾plant evaluation process of NASH patients. Although this
approach is debated, it may be reasonable in these patients
due to their inherently higher cardiovascular risk. Further￾more, this approach allows identifying patients with clinically
silent coronary artery disease and provides an opportunity to
revascularize them prior to LT. However, it is interesting to
note that in a small study of 13 patients, 50% with severe
coronary artery disease died due to cardiovascular causes
after LT surgery despite undergoing revascularization (3 per￾cutaneous coronary intervention and 6 coronary artery
bypass graft surgery) prior to surgery.31 This suggests that
there may be other factors to consider before embarking on
LT surgery in NASH patients.
Other traditional risk factors, such as hypertension, hyper￾lipidemia, T2DM and CKD should be screened and managed
appropriately. Despite the small potential risk of hepatotox￾icity, statins have far reaching benefits against progression of
cirrhosis, portal hypertension and HCC beyond treating
hyperlipidemia and thus should be strongly considered.32
Finally, the LT evaluation process should include a multidisci￾plinary team approach, including cardiology, cardiac anes￾thesiology, nephrology, endocrinology and nutrition in
addition to hepatology and transplant surgery, to appropri￾ately risk stratify and optimize NASH patients to improve
post-transplant outcomes.
Obesity and role of bariatric surgery
It is clear that obesity is highly prevalent in NASH patients.
Obesity by itself and high body mass index are not absolute
contraindications for LT surgery. Moreover, body mass index is
not a reliable indicator and tends to overestimate obesity in
the presence of ascites and volume overload. Studies on
effects of obesity on LT outcomes have shown conflicting
results. In a large meta-analysis published in 2015 that
included 13 studies comparing 2275 obese patients with
72212 non-obese LT recipients, body mass index did not
negatively impact the post-transplant survival.33 Because
body mass index is a less reliable surrogate for obesity,
other parameters such as visceral adipose tissue and
muscle mass should be included in the evaluation process to
optimally predict post-transplant survival.34
Based on the Scientific Registry of Organ Transplants data
from 1994 to 2013 that included over 85,000 adult LT
recipients, body mass index values did not impact post￾transplant survival, whereas T2DM in LT recipients in both
pre-transplant (hazard ratio of 1.21, 95% confidence interval
of 1.12-1.30) and post-transplant settings (hazard ratio of
1.06, 95% confidence interval of 1.02-1.11) and T2DM in
donors (hazard ratio of 1.10; 95% confidence interval of
1.02-1.19) were associated with poor outcomes.35 Therefore,
it is evident that, not obesity alone, but the presence of other
metabolic comorbidities in addition to obesity lead to poorer
outcomes. Nevertheless, a body mass index of $40 is gener￾ally considered a relative contraindication for LT in most
centers.
Bariatric surgery is a feasible option for morbidly obese
patients. Due to lack of data regarding long-term follow-up,
the optimal timing of bariatric surgery whether before, during
or after LT surgery remains unclear. Although metabolic
comorbidities seem to improve with bariatric surgery in the
pre-transplant setting, studies have reported significantly
higher post-operative complications.36,37 Concomitant LT
and bariatric surgery is an option in highly select patients.
In a Mayo study, LT candidates with a body mass index of
$35 who were unable to achieve weight loss goal in the
pre-transplant setting underwent combined LT surgery and
sleeve gastrectomy.38 Compared to the LT alone group, the
combined LT-sleeve gastrectomy group achieved more sus￾tained weight loss at 3-year post-transplant follow-up and
were less likely to develop insulin resistance, hepatic steato￾sis and hypertension. However, this approach is limited by
prolonged surgery time, immediate need for immunosup￾pression post-transplant, and risk of poor nutrition status.39
Overall, based on studies, sleeve gastrectomy appears to be a
preferred option compared to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
surgery and has several advantages. Compared to Roux-en￾Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy requires less operative
time, does not cause malabsorption or altered anatomy,
maintains adequate immunosuppression, and provides endo￾scopic access to the biliary system in the event of post-oper￾ative biliary complications.26 While weight-loss is a desired
goal in NASH patients, it is important to screen and manage
malnutrition and sarcopenia, which are independent predic￾tors of poor waitlist and post-transplant mortality. Studies

have shown that up to 25% of obese patients suffer from
malnutrition.40 Therefore, it is very critical to maintain
proper nutrition and adequate protein supplementation in
obese NASH patients who undergo bariatric surgery or are
enrolled in weight-loss programs, to avoid malnutrition and
sarcopenia.
Post-transplant outcomes of NASH compared other
CLDs
Despite the higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in
NASH patients, several studies have shown that post-trans￾plant outcomes of NASH patients are similar to those of other
indications of LT. In a large systematic review comparing LT
recipients with NASH (n=717) and non-NASH (n=3520), 1-
year, 3-year, and 5-year post-transplant survival rates were
similar between the two groups, although the NASH patients
were older, with higher prevalence of women, had higher
body mass index, and were more likely to have T2DM, hyper￾tension and hyperlipidemia compared to non-NASH counter￾parts.41 While NASH patients experienced higher mortality
due to CVD (odds ratio of 1.65, 95% confidence interval of
1.01-2.70; p = 0.05) and sepsis (odds ratio of 1.71; 95%
confidence interval of 1.17-2.50; p = 0.006), graft failure
was lower (odds ratio of 0.21; 95% confidence interval of
0.05-0.89; p=0.03) compared to non-NASH LT recipients.
Studies based on UNOS data, showed similar results. From
2001 to 2009, comparing 1959 NASH LT recipients and
33,822 non-NASH patients, 1-year and 3-year post-LT sur￾vival was similar: 84% and 78% for NASH respectively,
86% and 79% for cryptogenic cirrhosis, and 87% and 78%
for other indications (p=0.67).14 A more recent UNOS study
from 2003 to 2014 showed outcomes of 63,061 adult LT recip￾ients, including 20,782 HCV patients (32.96%), 9470 ALD
patients (15.02%), and 8262 NASH patients (13.11%).
Results of this study demonstrated that 5-year post-trans￾plant survival was better in NASH patients compared to HCV
(77.81% vs. 72.15, p<0.001) despite the NASH cohort being
more likely to have obesity and higher rates of T2DM and
CVD.12
In another retrospective study, Sadler et al.42 showed that
HCC patients with NASH (60/929, 6.5%) and non-NASH
(869/929, 93.5%) had similar 1-year, 3-year, 5-year survival
rates (98%, 96%, and 80% respectively in NASH vs. 95%,
84%, and 78% in non-NASH, p=0.1). Overall, based on mul￾tiple studies, both single-center as well as those involving
large databases, NASH patients, despite the older age and
higher prevalence of comorbidities compared to other etiolo￾gies, showed similar post-transplant survival. This could, in￾part, be explained by better graft survival rates and rigorous
LT selection process, where patients with higher cardiovascu￾lar risk are excluded from the LT waitlist.26
Recurrent NASH after LT
While recurrent NASH is an important complication in LT
recipients with NASH, de novo NASH is a growing concern in
non-NASH LT recipients. There are several reasons for this:
patients in the post-transplant setting generally feel well, not
in a catabolic state of cirrhosis, and are more likely increase
the daily calorie intake, resulting in accelerated weight gain.
In fact, use of corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive
agents, including calcineurin inhibitors and mammalian target
rapamycin inhibitors can result in metabolic derangement and
development of obesity, insulin resistance, T2DM, hyperten￾sion, and hyperlipidemia.43–46 Additionally, some studies
have suggested that non-NASH indications, such as HCV
and ALD, are also associated with development of de novo
NASH after LT.47,48 There exists a considerable heterogeneity
among the studies that estimated the prevalence of recurrent
and de novo NASH. In a study, 30% of the LT recipients with
NASH developed recurrent steatohepatitis at 1-year;
however, none of them developed cirrhosis in long-term
follow-up.49 The rates of recurrent NAFL in another study,
comprising 257 NASH/cryptogenic cirrhosis LT recipients, at
1-year, 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year follow-up were higher
(8.2%, 13.6%, 24.9%, and 32.9% respectively) compared
to non-NASH/cryptogenic cirrhosis LT recipients (3.1%,
5.9%, 9.6%, and 10%).50 However, the rate of recurrent
NASH was much lower, at 5% (13 out of 257), and advanced
fibrosis was rare, and in fact, post-LT survival was similar to
that in the non-NASH/cryptogenic cirrhosis group. Neverthe￾less, CVD and infection-related complications were higher in
patients with recurrent NAFL. Therefore, these patients
should be closely monitored to prevent rapid weight gain,
and screened for development of metabolic conditions and
managed accordingly.
Presence of NAFLD in donor livers is another challenge,
due to overall increasing prevalence of NAFLD in the general
population. This ominous trend not only affects the quality
and numbers of donor livers but it also may cause delayed or
primary graft dysfunction, as well as graft loss and poor
recipient outcomes ultimately.51–54 Steatosis-induced
microcirculatory and cellular dysfunction following reperfu￾sion is thought to be a major cause for hepatocyte necrosis
and graft loss. Thus, it is important to identify the extent of
steatosis in donor livers. Mild steatosis (<30%) in the donor
grafts is generally accepted and not associated with poor
outcomes compared to more than >30%, which showed
poor outcomes at 1-year after transplant.51,52,54 Some
transplant centers routinely perform donor rush liver
biopsy prior to LT and discard high-risk grafts; however,
this approach may prolong cold-ischemia time and is not
widely available in all centers. Nonetheless, donor steatosis
does not appear to affect rates of recurrent NASH in NASH￾recipients more than non-NASH recipients and therefore,
there is insufficient data to recommend different approach
in each group at this time.
Conclusions
NAFLD is steadily raising throughout the world and is on a
trajectory to become the number 1 indication of LT in the USA.
Despite the prevalence of metabolic comorbidities, post￾transplant survival for NASH is comparable to other etiolo￾gies. Obesity alone is not a contraindication for LT in the
absence of other comorbid conditions and body mass index is
not a reliable indicator of obesity in the presence of ascites
and volume overload. Weight loss surgery before or during LT
surgery can be considered in select patients but it is limited
only to specialized centers, due to higher complication rates.
Prevention of sarcopenia and malnutrition while achieving
weight loss is a challenging task. LT cures end-stage liver
disease but not the underlying metabolic risk factors asso￾ciated with NAFLD; therefore, strategies to address these
comorbidities are crucial to improve outcomes and prevent
recurrence of NAFLD after transplantation. Prevalence of

NAFLD in donor livers is increasing and needs attention to
expand the donor pool to meet the growing demand for LT.
