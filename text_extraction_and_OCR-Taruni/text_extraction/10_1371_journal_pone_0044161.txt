Abstract
Elevations of circulating Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) are associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes and
progression of renal failure in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Efforts to identify gene products whose transcription is directly
regulated by FGF23 stimulation of fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR)/a-Klotho complexes in the kidney is
confounded by both systemic alterations in calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D metabolism and intrinsic alterations caused
by the underlying renal pathology in CKD. To identify FGF23 responsive genes in the kidney that might explain the
association between FGF23 and adverse outcomes in CKD, we performed comparative genome wide analysis of gene
expression profiles in the kidney of the Collagen 4 alpha 3 null mice (Col4a32/2) model of progressive kidney disease with
kidney expression profiles of Hypophosphatemic (Hyp) and FGF23 transgenic mouse models of elevated FGF23. The
different complement of potentially confounding factors in these models allowed us to identify genes that are directly
targeted by FGF23. This analysis found that a-Klotho, an anti-aging hormone and FGF23 co-receptor, was decreased by
FGF23. We also identified additional FGF23-responsive transcripts and activation of networks associated with renal damage
and chronic inflammation, including lipocalin 2 (Lcn2), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b) and tumor necrosis factor￾alpha (TNF-a) signaling pathways. Finally, we found that FGF23 suppresses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
expression in the kidney, thereby providing a pathway for FGF23 regulation of the renin-angiotensin system. These gene
products provide a possible mechanistic links between elevated FGF23 and pathways responsible for renal failure
progression and cardiovascular diseases.

Introduction
FGF23 is a bone-derived hormone that regulates phosphate and
vitamin D metabolism through FGFR/a-Klotho co-receptors [1]
that are expressed in a limited number of tissues, including the
kidney [2]. In the kidney, FGF23 suppresses sodium-phosphate co￾transporter function leading to phosphaturia and reduces
1,25(OH)2D synthesis in the proximal tubule [3,4]. Physiological￾ly, FGF23 is part of a bone-kidney feedback loop [4,5], where
circulating 1,25(OH)2D stimulates FGF23 production in bone and
FGF23 suppresses 1,25(OH)2D production in the kidney [5].
FGF23 expression is also regulated by local bone-derived factors
that may link bone mineralization with renal phosphate handling
[6,7,8].
FGF23 plays a pathological role in hereditary hypophosphate￾mic disorders [8] and tumor induced osteomalacia [9]. Elevations
of circulating FGF23 also occur early in the course of chronic
kidney disease (CKD), where it stimulates phosphaturia to
maintain phosphate balance and contributes to the development
of secondary hyperparathyroidism through suppression of
1,25(OH)2D levels [10,11,12]. FGF23 is also markedly elevated
in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) [13,14,15].
Elevated FGF23 levels are associated with left-ventricular
hypertrophy and hypertension in patients with X-linked hypo￾phosphatemia (XLH) [16]. FGF23 is also an independent risk
factor for left ventricular hypertrophy [17] and cardiovascular
disease [18] in the general population. In chronic kidney disease,
FGF23 is one of the strongest predictors of mortality [19,20], and
adverse cardiovascular outcomes [21,22]. In addition, elevated
circulating FGF23 concentrations are independently associated
with more rapid progression of kidney disease [23] and renal
allograft loss [24].
There are many gaps in our knowledge of the molecular
mechanisms whereby FGF23 regulates kidney function and leads
to adverse outcomes in CKD. It is uncertain which tubular
segment and FGF receptors mediate the effects of FGF23 on the
kidney [25]. In addition, knowledge of the full complement of
renal gene products regulated by FGF23 in the kidney that might
mediate progressive renal damage or kidney processes affecting
cardiovascular disease is largely unexplored. Without this infor￾PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 September 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 9 | e44161

mation, it remains uncertain whether the associations between
FGF23 and adverse outcomes represent cause-and-effect relation￾ships or epiphenomena due to co-variance of FGF23 with other
causative factors arising from the loss of renal function [26,27]. In
addition, because of the limited number of organs that co-express
FGFR/2a-Klotho complexes [28], it is also possible that elevated
circulating FGF23 are directly mediated by off-target effects of
FGF23 to activate FGF receptors in non-renal tissues [22], rather
than indirectly thru FGFR/a-Klotho-dependent modulation of
systemic pathways affecting the cardiovascular system.
Determining the FGF23 responsive genes in the kidney in the
setting of chronic kidney disease is challenging because of the
systemic effects resulting from FGF23 regulation of phosphate and
vitamin D homeostasis and the intrinsic abnormalities related to
kidney disease process. To define FGF23 responsive genes in
CKD, we performed a genome wide comparative analysis of
kidney gene expression in the Col4a32/2 model of excess FGF23
[29] and CKD. We compared this CKD model to the kidney gene
transcriptome of models of excess FGF23 without CKD that have
different abnormalities of phosphate and vitamin D regulation
[30,31]. Shared candidate FGF23 responsive genes in the kidney
of these models were confirmed by assessing their expression in
FGF232/2 mice and following the acute and chronic administra￾tion of recombinant FGF23 in vivo. Direct regulation of a subset of
genes by FGF23 was assessed in distal tubule cells ex vivo. We
identified several genes regulated by FGF23 that may link this
hormone to processes responsible for progression of kidney disease
as well as pathways responsible for adverse cardiovascular
outcomes.
Results
Col4a32/2 Mice, a Model of FGF23 Excess
Col4a3+/+
(WT) Col4a3+/2 and Col4a32/2 mice were found to
be born with the expected Medelian frequency. Homozygous
Col4a32/2 display are known to display a progressive decrease in
kidney function [32]. By 12 weeks-of-age, we observed a decrease
in body-weight in Col4a32/2 mice (Figure 1A &B) and the
presence of kidney disease, as evidenced by reduced kidney size
(Figure 1C) and histological evidence of glomerulosclerosis and
interstitial cell infiltration (Figure 1D). A 3-fold increase in blood
urea nitrogen (BUN) and 2-fold increase in creatinine were
observed in Col4a32/2 mice (Table 1). Col4a32/2 mice had a
55-fold increase in serum PTH and a 9-fold increase in serum
FGF23 concentrations along with an increase in fractional
excretion of phosphate. Serum phosphate and calcium concen￾trations were also increased in Col4a32/2 mice (Table 1).
Identification of Additional Renal Signalization Pathways
in Chronic Kidney Disease
Clustering of all the significant genes revealed two different
patterns corresponding to increased and decreased expression of
renal transcripts in Col4a32/2 mice as compared to their WT age￾matched control animals (Figure 2A). Subsequent analysis
revealed that chronic kidney disease led to a dramatic upregula￾tion of gene transcripts, whereas the degree of downregulation was
more limited. For instance, using a stringent, five-fold selection
criteria to identify changes in gene transcripts, we found that only
4 transcripts were downregulated by this magnitude, whereas 500
genes were upregulated by at least 5-fold in Col4a32/2 mice
(Figure 2B). This shows that kidney disease progression involves
activation of gene transcription and that modifications in the renal
transcriptiome is not simply a passive process caused by loss of
functioning renal tissue.
The top 25 upregulated genes (Table 2) showed evidence of
matrix protein replacement with increased collagen synthesis
(Col1a1 and Col3a1) and cellular infiltration (Cxcl1, Lyzs, Ccl5,
Lyz2, Lyz, C3 VCAM1 and Ear2), consistent with the histological
presence of chronic kidney disease in the mice. In total, more than
30 transcripts of protein belonging to the collagen familly were
increased in the kidneys of Col4a32/2 mice, as well as proteins
from the TNFa superfamilly (30 transcripts) and TGFb super￾familly (11 transcripts). Furthermore, TIMP1 was increased along
with a substantial disregulation in proteases in the kidney of
Col4a32/2 mice, with a total of 24 mettaloendopeptidases being
overexpressed.
The top 25 down-regulated genes are shown in Table 3. Of
note, we found evidence for reductions in DNAse1 and epidermal
growth factor (EGF). In addition, we observed reductions in COP9
[33], which regulate ubiquitin-meidated proteoloysis of cullin that
is cause of pseudohypoaldosteroinism type 2 and involved in distal
tubular regulation of blood pressure and potasium homeostasis
[34]. We also observed reduction in Cyp2c44, which important in
producing compensatory renal artery vasodilation in response to
salt-loading through the regulation of prostaglandin metabolism
[35]. We also observed reduction in Slc6a19, which is a major
luminal sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter in the
proximal tubule [36] and parvalbumin, which is involved in distal
convoluted sodium transport [37]. Higd1c, which belongs to
hypoxia inducible genes that may play a role in protecting the
kidney from hypoxic injury during progressive CKD [38], was also
reduced in Col4a32/2 kidneys. Corin, a protease that activates
atrial natriuretic peptide, was also reduced in the kidneys of
Col4a32/2 mice [39].
A total of twelve up-regulated and twelve downregulated genes
were randomly chosen from the renal Co4a32/2 transcriptome to
be confirmed by RT-PCR as shown in Table 4. We also
confirmed that the proteins encoded by the mRNAs of the most
downregulated and upregulated genes, DNAse1 and Lcn2
respectively, were also altered, as shown in Figure 3.
FGF23-related Gene Transcripts in the Kidney
To establish that the Col4a32/2 microarray data set contained
genes involved in FGF23 regulation of mineral metabolism, we
initially focused on alterations in Cyp24a1, Cyp27b1, Npt2a,
Npt2c and Klotho expression. We found that Col4a32/2 mice
displayed an increase in the renal Cyp24a1 transcripts, (2.6 and
5.1 fold by microarray and RT-PCR, respectively) as well as
marked increase in Cyp24a1 protein level (Figure 4). However,
we failed to detect any significant changes in Cyp27b1 expression.
Additionally, Npt2c (22.0 and 22.3 fold by microarray and RT￾PCR), but not Npt2a, was down-regulated in the kidney of
Col4a32/2. Most importantly, a-Klotho, the FGF23 co-receptor,
was down-regulated (22 and 22.2 fold by microarray and RT￾PCR) and a-Klotho protein levels in the kidney were reduced by
immunohistochemical staining (Figure 4).
Comparative Analysis of FGF23 Excess Models
To determine additional FGF23-responsive genes in the kidney
of Col4a32/2 mice, we compared microarray analysis of kidneys
isolated from 12 week-old WT and Col4a32/2 mice with the renal
transcriptome in Hyp mice, which have hypophosphatemia and
elevated FGF23 caused by inactivating mutations of Phex in
osteoblasts [40], and FGF23 transgenic mice [31]. We hypothe￾sized that shared genes in these three data sets would be enriched
with FGF23-responsive transcripts.
From 13694 transcripts present in all three datasets, 31 were
found to be significantly altered in the kidney of two or more

mutant mice models compared to their respective WT control
mice (Figure 5). We have identified 19 of these genes that were
consistently (downregulated or upregulated compared to their
respective controls in all three datasets) altered in Col4a32/2, Hyp
and FGF23-transgenic mice (Table 5) by subsequently testing by
PCR other populations of the same mice. Eleven gene transcripts
were increased (Table 5), including lipocalin 2 (Lcn2), which was
the most up-regulated transcript common to Col4a32/2 and
FGF23tg databases (but not the Hyp data set). In addition,
inflamatory markers, including VCAM1, which is expressed in
proximal tubule cells in response to inflammatory renal diseases
[41], complement factor I, a serine protease that regulates the
complement cascacade, and galectin-3-binding protein
(LGALS3BP), were increased in all data sets. Several genes
related to cell signaling were also increased, including tumor￾associated calcium signal transducer 2 (Tacstd2), Receptor activity
modifying protein 2 (Ramp2), guanylate binding protein 2,
immediate early response 3, (ler3), phospholipase A2 (Pla2g7),
phospholipid scramblase 1 (Plscr1). Lipoprotein-associated phos￾pholipase A2 (Pla2g7), an enzyme mostly synthesized by plaque
inflammatory cells (macrophages, T cells, mast cells) that
hydrolyzes oxidized phospholipids in LDL was also upregulated.
With regards to down-regulated genes, 8 were reduced in all
three data sets. Most interestingly, in addtion to reductions in a￾Klotho described above, we also found that DNase1, a secreted
nuclease that eliminates DNA from necrotic cells, was dramatically

reduced in all three data sets. Most interestingly, angiotensin￾converting enzyme (ACE) 2, a homolog to the carboxypeptidase
ACE, was decreased in all three data sets. Finally, Them2
(thioesterase superfamily member 2) a 140-amino-acid protein of
unknown biological function was also decreased.
Finally, we performed an Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to identify
molecular interactions networks (Figure 6) related to these newly
identified transcripts. Consistent with the non-mineral metabolism
pattern of the expanded set of FGF23-regulated genes, this
analysis suggests a central role of activation of transforming growth
factor beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TGF-beta and TNF￾alpha), nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in
B-cells 1 (NFkB), interleukin 1, beta (IL1B), interferon, platlet
derived growth factor (PDGF), progesterone, protein kinase C,
epsilon (PRKCE), and Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 13 (CCL13)
pathways in the common genes regulated in the three data sets,
consistent with activation of inflamatory and immunoregulatory
processes.
Independent Confirmation of Newly Identified FGF23-
responsive Genes
We have used complementary in vivo approaches to verify
FGF23 regulated genes in the kidney. First, we tested the effects of
chronic daily administration of rat recombinant rFGF23 on genes
identified from the comparative microarray analysis, plus addi￾tional genes (Cyp24a1, Cyp27b1, Npt2a and Npt2c) in FGF232/2
and compound Col4a32/2 FGF232/2 mice. The FGF23 null
background was used to minimize the effects of endogenous

FGF23 production peaks, as well as the amount of FGF23 injected
to these animals. The administration of 50ng/g of rFGF23 twice
daily to FGF232/2 and compound Col4a32/2 FGF232/2 mice
resulted in a ,12-fold increase in Cyp24a1 and induced a
decrease in Cyp27b1 expression (Table 6), consistent with known
actions of FGF23 on these gene products. Additionally, we have
found that chronic FGF23 administration induced elevations in 5
genes (lcn2, cfi, vcam1,gbp2 and plscr1) and decreased the
expression of 4 genes (dnase1, car14 ace2 and slca2) in FGF232/2
mice.
Secondly, we have transferred FGF232/2 mice on the
Col4a32/2 background, thus identifying genes that respond to
CKD progression independently of FGF23. We found that lcn2,
cfi, pla2g7, and ier3 were upregulated by kidney disease
progression. In addition, we also administered rFGF23 to
compound FGF232/2Col4a32/2 mice, to attempt separation of
CKD effects from those mediated by FGF23, as well as possible
interactions between FGF23 and CKD. The transfer of FGF232/
2 on the CKD background, singled out genes that respond to
FGF23 only with decline in renal function (upregulated: tacstd2,
lgals3bp, ramp2; downregulated: afm, them2). Renal failure and
FGF23 interacted to further increase FGF23 actions on lcn2, cfi
and ier3, while CKD, although without independent regulatory
actions per se, potentiated the effects of FGF23 on gbp2,,plscr1,
dnase1 and slc2a2. Interestingly, Klotho is upregulated by rFGF23
in FGF232/2 mice and normalized in animals with impaired renal
function.
Since the chronic admnistaration of FGF23 may lead ot
systemic changes, we also evaulated the rapid, short-term response
to rFGF23 admnistration. This was accomplished by examining
the acute effects of rFGF23 administration in C57Bl6 mice after 1
and 12 h. We found that injection of rFGF23 resulted in a 10-fold
increase in Cyp24a1 one hour after injection that persisted after
12 h. We also observed that rFGF23 induced a decrease in
Cyp27b1 and Npt2c, but had no effect on Npt2a (Table 7).
Lipocalin2 was confirmed to be increased in the kidney following
rFGF23 administration. We also found that GBP2 Tacstd2 and
Plscr1 were increased in response to acute FGF23 elevation.
Furthermore, Dnase1 and Car14 were decreased by FGF23,
consistent with the microarray data. However, we could not
confirm FGF23 regulation of ACE2 and Them2 in these short￾term FGF23 administration studies.
To investigate if FGF23 directly regulates these genes, we
examined the effects of rFGF23 on distal 209 renal tubular cells
in vitro. By real-time PCR, we found that 209 cells express a-klotho
and FGFR4, and lesser amounts of FGFR1 or FGFR3 transcripts
(data not shown). We found that 8 of 10 genes tested were directly
modified by FGF23 in vitro, including FGF23 stimulation of

Discussion
Comparative analysis of gene expression profiles of the
Col4a32/2 mice, a CKD model of elevated circulating levels of
FGF23, and two other models of FGF23 excess and normal renal
function [31,40,42,43], along with confirmation of FGF23
regulation of these transcripts in vivo and in vitro, identified novel
genes not previously recognized to be regulated by FGF23 as well
as confirmed the regulation of genes known to be regulated by
FGF23 in the kidney.
The effects of FGF23 on phosphate and vitamin D metabolism
are mediated by the regulation of Npt2a, Cyp27b1 and Cyp24a1
functions in the proximal tubule [9]. With the exception of Npt2a,
we have evidence in Col4a2/2 mice of alterations in Cyp24a1,
Nap2a, Npt2c by FGF23, consistent with their known involvement
in mediating FGF23 effects on kidney phosphate, calcium and
vitamin D metabolism. The failure to observe changes in Npt2a
gene transcripts likely points to the important role of post￾translation regulation of brush border membrane insertion of this
transporter in the regulation of phosphate transport [44]. Also,
consistent with post-transcriptional regulation of Cyp27b1, FGF23
had only transient effects on Cyp27b1 gene transcription [45].
While serum soluble a-Klotho concentrations are inversely
correlated with serum FGF23 [46] and reductions in a-Klotho
mRNA levels in the kidney have been observed with CKD and
other states of FGF23 excess FGF23 [47], direct regulation of a￾Klotho by FGF23 has not been previously demonstrated. Rather,
reductions in a-Klotho in CKD has been attributed to a primary
decrement a-Klotho caused by loss of renal tubular cells in the
diseased kidney, leading to secondary increments in FGF23 [48].
Both a-Klotho message and protein were decreased in kidneys of
Col4a32/2 mice, and the administration of rFGF23 results in
decrements in a-Klotho expression in the kidney of wild-type mice
and in cultured distal tubular cells. Interestingly however, chronic
administration of rFGF23 to both Fgf232/2 and Col4a32/
2Fgf232/2 mice, failed to suppress a-Klotho message levels,
which may be due to offsetting effects of 1,25(OH)2D, which is
known to stimulate a-Klotho gene transcription [49], in this
model. Regardless, FGF23 suppression of a-Klotho might have
several physiological effects, including providing a mechanism to
desensitize FGF23 signaling responses through FGFR [50] as well
as regulate circulating forms of a-Klotho produced by the distal
tubule that potential act as a hormone and/or paracrine co-factor
for several growth factor receptors [28,48] [48,51].
We identified other gene products that could potentially
account for the associations between elevated circulating FGF23
concentrations renal failure progression and cardiovascular
mortality that have been found in clinical association studies. At
present it is not certain if these untoward effects associated with
elevations in FGF23 are due to direct effects of FGF23 on FGFR/
a-Klotho complexes in the kidney, off ‘‘target effects’’ of high
levels of FGF23 to directly activate FGFRs in the absence of a￾Kotho in the heart [22], or represent epiphenomena caused by
effects of CKD to increase FGF23 levels. In support of on-target
actions, we identified FGF23-regulated renal genes with mecha￾nistic linkages to cardiovascular diseases. In this regard, we found
that ACE2 is reduced by excess FGF23 in all three models and
found that FGF23 suppresses ACE2 expression in the distal tubule
cultures. ACE2 is a negative regulator of the rennin-angiotensin
system (RAS) that has vasodilator and natriuretic effects, leading to
reduced blood pressure [52]. A direct effect of FGF23 to suppress
ACE2 provides an alternative explanation for the recently
proposed associations between vitamin D deficiency, activation
of the renin-angiotensin system and regulation of a-Klotho
expression [53]. FGF23 direct suppression of ACE2 expression
could lead to activation of RAS, establishing a linkage between
increased FGF23 and increased mortality.

We also identified renal gene products that may mediate a
direct effect of FGF23 to accelerate the progression of chronic
kidney disease. In addtion to a-Klotho, which has been shown to
modulate renal damage [54], we also observed FGF23 regulation
of several other genes associated with renal injury, including, Cfi,
which has been shown to contribute to inflammatory and acute
renal injury [55,56], and suggesting an effect of FGF23-mediated
complement activation; DNase1, which is associated with systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE) [57,58], implicating a role of FGF23 in
stimulating inflamatory responses in the kidney; carbonic anhy￾drase 14 (car14), whose inactivation in transgenic mice leads to
progressive renal injury [59,60]. Additionally, both slc2a2 and
afamin were found to be downregulated in the distal tubular cell
line by Fgf23. Slc2a2 (also known as the glucose transporter gene
GLUT2) is a disease causing gene for Fanconi-Bickel syndrome,
which has systemic as well as characteristic tubular nephropathy

abnormalities [61]. Decrements in afamin (Afm), a vitamin E￾binding protein, related to vitamin D binding protein [62], are
observed in early acute renal allograft rejection [63].
Regarding additional genes involved in renal injury, we found
that lcn2 (or NGAL) was markedly increased in the Col4a32/2
and the FGF23Tg data set as well as in Fgf232/2 and Col4a32/2
Fgf232/2 mice receiving rFGF23. Lcn2 mRNA is normally
expressed in the kidney [64] where it promotes epithelial
differentiation of the mesenchymal progenitors, leading to the
generation of glomeruli, proximal tubules, Henle’s loop and distal
tubules [65,66]. Lcn2 expression is markedly induced in injured
epithelial cells through NF-kB dependent pathways [67], and plays
a central role in controlling cell survival and proliferation [68–69].
Lcn2 has been shown to contribute to CKD progression both in
mice and humans [70]. The magnitude of the increase in Lcn2 as
a response to FGF23 was greater in animals with CKD, suggesting
that other factors other than FGF23 are also stimulating
transcription of this gene. Additionally, 8 other genes which are
significantly expressed during the repair stage in AKI were also
increased in the kidneys of Col4a32/2 mice, including C3,
Vcam1, Serpin10 m C3, Lyz, Col3a1, Col1a1,and abp1 [71].
Finally, Them2, which belongs to a family of enzymes that play an
important role in lipid metabolism and might contribute to tubular
toxicity [72] was also increased in models of FGF23 excess.
Finally, pathway analysis identified TGF- b and TNF- a
signaling pathways as being involved in FGF23 responses in the
kidney. The TGF-b pathway are increased in most forms of CKD
in humans and experimental animals and controls including
fibrogenesis, apoptosis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and
inflammation leading to glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial
fibrosis [73]. Three additional genes observed to be altered in a
Tgf-b1 Tg mouse model of CKD, were also in the top modified
genes in the Col4a32/2 kidneys, including Timp1, Lcn2 and
Cxcl1 [73]. TNF alpha is a central proinflammatory agonist
mediator that is generated in a wide variety of innate and adaptive
immune responses inflammatory mechanisms regulated by TNF
might contribute to renal disease progression and cardiovascular
events [74,75,76], and even in non-calcified aortas in patients with
CKD display increased TNF immunoreactivity [77]. The central
role of these pathways, together with IL1-beta, another pro￾inflammatory cytokine, demonstrate that the inflammatory state
that correlates with kidney disease may be modified by FGF23.
We also found FGF23 associated increases in VCAM1, which is
expressed in proximal tubule cells in response to inflammatory
renal diseases [41], and interferon-induced guanylate-binding
protein 2 (GBP2), which regulates cell growth and matrix
metalloproteinase expression [78].
Our analysis has several limitations. Data sets from Hyp and
FGF23Tg mice have fewer number of genes analyzed than the
Col4a32/2 (,13,000 vs. ,45,000, respectively), with the resulting
possibility that some genes may have been missed. The presence of
CKD could mask FGF23-responsive genes since both FGF
receptors and klotho expression and function are altered.
However, this appears to be an minor issue, since we confirmed
that the known FGF23 regulated genes were still altered in this
model. In addition, the microarray analysis was performed in
whole tissues, which gives a composite read out of all cell types.
We also did not define the specific tubular segments or the role of
Klotho/FGFR complexes in the FGF23-mediated changes in gene
expression in the kidney. Further studies will be needed to
determine the cell-type specific alterations in gene expression. Age
difference between the animals of all three databases may also
confound the interpretation. The functional significance of FGF23
regulation of these genes remains to be established.
Regardless, we have discovered novel and potentially important
FGF23 regulated genes involved in inflammation and progressive
renal fibrosis as well as alterations in factors with systemic effects,
such as ACE2, which might impact on cardiovascular function.
Further studies are needed to test the role of these factors in linking
FGF23 to mortality and progressive renal dysfuction.
Materials and Methods
Animals and Genotyping
All mice were maintained on a standard diet (7912, Harlan
Teklad, Madison, WI, USA). Animal care and protocols were in
accordance with the guidelines established by the University of
Tennessee Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee as
detailed in the ‘‘Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals,’’
prepared by the Institute on Laboratory Animal Resources,
National Research Council (Department of Health & Human
Services Publication NIH 86–23, National Academy Press, 1996)
and UTHSC IACUC specifically approved this study (protocol
1884). Animals were anesthetized before serum collection and
sacrifice by ip injection of ketamin (120 mg/Kg) and xylazin
(20 mg/Kg), followed by cervical dislocation. During the entire
period of the study, activity, respiratory rate, muscle strength via
grip strength, feeding and drinking, fur loss were the major signs

investigator team and daily by the Comparative Medicine
employees. If any signs of discomfort or infection were observed,
the animal was euthanized by CO2 inhalation followed by cervical
dislocation and excluded from the study.
Heterozygous Col4a3+/2 mice were initially obtained from
Jackson Laboratories (Westgrove, PA, USA). To obtain the
compound Col4a32/2 Fgf23 mice 2/2 we first crossed heterozy￾gous Col4a3+/2 females to Fgf23 mice +/2 males to obtain
Col4a3+/2/
Fgf23+/2mice and then crossed Col4a3+/2/
Fgf23+/2
males to Col4a3+/2/
Fgf23+/2.
Tail or ear biopsies were collected to genotype the mice.
REDExtract-N-Amp Tissue PCR Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA) was used for DNA extraction and PCR amplification.
Mice were genotyped for col4a3 mutation and PCR was repeated
in all mice after sacrifice to exclude artifacts and ensure the correct
genotype [30,79].
Administration of Rat Recombinant FGF23
Rat recombinant FGF23 (rFGF23) was administered intraper￾itoneally (ip) to WT, Fgf232/2 and Col4a32/2/
Fgf232/2 mice.
To test the chronic effects of FGF23, FGF232/2 and compound
Col4a32/2 FGF232/2 mice were administered twice daily (every
12 hours) with 50 ng/g rFGF23 during eight weeks. Kidneys were
collected 12 hours after the last rFGF23 administration. This
procedure partially corrected the circulating FGF23 levels in
serum samples collected 6 and 12 hours after the last injection
(69622 and 47616 in FGF232/2 mice and 65614 and 41612 in
Col4a32/2FGF232/2). To test the acute effects of excess FGF23,
C57Bl6 mice were given a single injection of 50ng/g rFGF23 and
the kidneys were collected 1 and 12 hours after the injection.
Experimental animals were compared to animals of the same
genotype receiving 0.9% NaCl vehicle.
Serum Biochemistry
Serum samples were collected by intracardiac exsanguination.
Serum calcium was measured using a Calcium CPC Liquicolor
Kit (Stanbio Laboratories, Boerne, TX, USA) and serum
phosphorus was measured using the phosphomolybdylate-ascorbic
acid method, as previously described [80]. Serum parathyroid
hormone (PTH) levels were measured using the Mouse Intact
PTH ELISA kit (Immutopics, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Serum
1,25(OH)2D and 25OHD levels were measured using the vitamin
D EIA Kits (Immunodiagnostic Systems, Fountain Hills, AZ,

ELISA kit (Kainos Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan).
RT-PCR and Microarray
RT-PCR and microarray analysis were performed on kidneys
from 12 week-old mice. Total RNAs were isolated using TRI￾reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA)
according to previously published method [81]. First-strand cDNA
was synthesized from the kidney RNAs using iScript cDNA
Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The 20mL reverse
transcriptase reaction was based on 1mg total RNA. The iCycler
iQ Real-Time PCR Detection System and iQ SYBR Green
Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) were used for real-time
quantitative PCR analysis. The expression was normalized by
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh) in the same

Western Blotting and Immunohistochemistry
These techniques were performed as previously described
[8,82,83]. Briefly, total proteins from kidneys were extracted in
1ml lysis buffer of T-PER Tissue protein extraction reagent
(Pierce, IL, USA). supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche
Applied Science, IN, USA). Protein lysates (25 mg/sample) were
reduced and extracted in LDS Sample buffer (Invitrogen, CA,
USA) heated for 10 min at 70uC, migrated on NuPAGE Novex
10% Bis-Tris Gels (Invitrogen, CA, USA), and then analyzed by
Western blotting using the ECL Advance WB Detection Kit (GE
Healthcare, UK). The immunoreactive bands were visualized
using enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (GE
Healthcare, UK) on a Fluor-S Multi Imager (BioRad, CA,
USA). Band intensities were determined by densitometry using
ImageJ (NIH, USA).
For immunohistochemistry, left kidneys were dehydrated in
absolute ethanol and embedded in paraffin. 5mm thick sections
were cut on a rotary microtome. Sections were dried overnight
on pre-charged pre-cleaned slides (VWR Scientific, PA, USA),
deparaffinized and rehydrated. Nonspecific sites were blocked
with 1X animal free blocker (Vector Laboratories Inc., CA,
USA) and then sections were incubated with specific primary
antibodies for 1 hour. An Immunohistological Vectastain ABC
kit (Vector Laboratories Inc., CA, USA) was subsequently used
for detection of the target protein and slides counterstained with
DAPI, dehydrated and mounted with entellan. The following
primary antibodies have been used: goat-raised anti-human
Klotho (sc-22218), goat-raised anti-human Cyp27b1 (sc-49642),
goat-raised anti-human Cyp24a1 (sc-32165), goat-raised anti￾mouse lipocalin2 (sc-18698), goat-raised anti-mouse DNase1 (sc￾19269) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).

Friedman [84]. Cells were plated in standard 25 cm2 flasks and
allowed to grow until confluence. Cells were removed with 0.25%
trypsin solution containing 0.02% EDTA (Sigma- Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA) and plated on 6-well plates for 7 days, then
treated with 2 mg/well of rFGF23 or vehicle for 24 hours.
Statistics
Differences among the two groups were tested by Student T test
using the Statistica software (Statsoft, Tulsa, OK, USA). The
differences were considered statistically significant at p,0.05.
Microarray analysis and filtering was performed as previously
described [8]. Briefly, microarray data were analyzed using
GeneSpring GX7.3 software (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara,
CA, USA). The Robust Multichip Averaging probe summariza￾tion algorithm was used to perform background correction,
normalization, and probe summarization. Data were normalized
per chip and per gene to the median. Genes were filtered to
include only those that were expressed in at least one of the eight
samples. The statistical analysis was performed using a one-way
ANOVA followed by Benjamini-Hochberg multiple test correction
assuming variances were equals to minimize the false positive
discovery. P value was set at 0.05. Cluster analysis using a gene
tree classification, Pearson correlation and average linkage was
then performed to identify groups of genes for which the patterns
of expression were similar. Pathway analysis was performed using
the Ingenuity program (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA,
USA) to match the identified genes of interest to already known
broader networks of genes contained in the literature database.
