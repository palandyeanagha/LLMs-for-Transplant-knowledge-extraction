Alagille's syndrome associated with cystic renal
disease
S R Martin, L Garel, F Alvarez
Abstract
Although renal abnormalities have been
described in children with Alagille's
syndrome, cystic kidney disease has not
often been documented, and then usually
only at necropsy. Three children with
Alagille's syndrome are described, in two
of whom a unilateral multicystic dysplas￾tic kidney was detected by prenatal ultra￾sound; in the other, a solitary cortical cyst
was found later in childhood. All have
normal renal function, growth, and liver
synthetic function but continue to have
clinical and biochemical signs of cholesta￾sis. These cases show that unilateral cystic
kidney disease with or without renal dys￾plasia may be associated with Alagille's
syndrome, that the clinical course is
not necessarily unfavourable, and that
Alagille's syndrome should be included in
the differential diagnosis of cystic kidney
disorders associated with cholestatic liver
disease. Patients with Alagille's syndrome
should be evaluated by renal ultrasound.

Alagille's syndrome, one of the most common
causes of intrahepatic cholestasis of infancy, is
a familial disorder characterised by five major
features: abnormal facies, chronic cholestasis,
butterfly vertebrae, peripheral pulmonary
artery stenosis, and posterior embryotoxon of
the eye. Renal involvement, which is included
among a number of other less common mani￾festations, has recently been reported more
often.2-12 Renal abnormalities comprise three
main types: non-specific mild alterations in
renal function,8 10 12 those possibly related to
the hypercholesterolaemia that is associated
with cholestasis, such as mesangiolipidosis,2-4
and those resulting from abnormalities in renal
morphogenesis.2 4-12 We present three French
Canadian children with Alagille's syndrome
associated with cystic kidney disease, in two
of whom the diagnosis was initially made by
fetal ultrasound. These observations have
importance for the significance of multicystic
kidneys detected prenatally and extends the
differential diagnosis of hepatic disorders
associated with cystic kidney disease.
Case 1
A 21 month male was admitted to hospital at 4
months of age for jaundice associated with
acholic stools. Previously, he had been investi￾gated for renal disease that presented with a
multicystic right kidney detected by fetal ultra￾sound at 16 and 24 weeks' gestation and con￾firmed postnatally (fig 1). Evaluation in the
neonatal period revealed a urinary tract infec￾tion with Escherichia coli that was treated. He
was jaundiced in the first week of life but the
jaundice resolved spontaneously. Results of
investigations of his kidney disease are shown
in table 1. At 4 months of age investigations
for cholestasis revealed a total bilirubin of
139 mmol/l (normal <23 mmol/l) and direct
bilirubin of 105 mmol/l (normal <19 mmoYl).
The -y glutamyltranspeptidase (-yGT) was 40 x
normal and there was evidence of fat soluble
vitamin deficiency. The diagnosis of Alagille's
syndrome was suggested by the presence of
four of the five major clinical features -
cholestasis associated with the typical facies,
peripheral pulmonary stenosis, and posterior
embryotoxon. In addition, the patient's cry
was high pitched, as previously described in
this syndrome.2 Liver biopsy revealed diffuse
cholestasis, enlargement of the portal tracts
with mild fibrosis, paucity of interlobular bile
ducts, and a degeneration of the bile ducts with
vacuolisation of the epithelium.
At 23 months of age, his course has been
marked by normal growth (height 5th centile
for age, weight 10th centile), variable choles￾tasis (currently: total bilirubin 136 mmol/l;
direct bilirubin 74 mmol/1; -yGT 15X normal,
and normal liver synthetic function). He
receives supplemental fat soluble vitamins.
Xanthomas were first observed at 14 months of
age; serum cholesterol peaked at 17 months of
age at 41 mmol/l (normal <4 3 mmol/l) and
has since gradually declined to 15-9 mmol/l.
Pruritus became clinically significant at 10
months of age and was treated with variable

ursodeoxycholic acid, or rifampicin.
Case 2
A left multicystic dysplastic kidney was
detected by prenatal ultrasound in this patient
at 19 weeks (fig 2) and confirmed at 21 and 27
weeks' gestation. He was born at term with a
birth weight of 3750 g. Jaundice was noted on
the third day of life; the serum bilirubin con￾centration peaked on the fifth day (total bili￾rubin 208 mmoll; direct 111 mmol/l ). At six
weeks of age he was admitted to hospital for
investigation of his kidney disorder and persis￾tent cholestasis. The renal findings are sum￾marised in table 1. The diagnosis of Alagille's
syndrome was established from the presence
of chronic cholestasis, peripheral pulmonary
stenosis, posterior embryotoxon, butterfly
vertebrae, and typical facies. Follow up was
notable only for biochemical signs of choles￾tasis (total bilirubin 23 mmol/l; direct bilirubin
19 mmol/l; -yGT 29 x normal, cholesterol
6-9 mmol/l) without xanthomas, for which he
has received supplemental fat soluble vitamins,
and a mild pruritus that was successfully
treated with ursodeoxycholic acid. His growth
is normal (weight 10th centile for age, height
50th centile).
Case 3
This 14 year old patient was initially dis￾covered to have a solitary cortical cyst of the
right kidney on routine follow up ultrasound at
1 1 years of age (table 1). He was first admitted
to hospital at Hopital Sainte Justine at 21
months of age for pruritus and biochemical
changes consistent with cholestasis. He had
presented elsewhere with cholestasis on the
fourth day of life that had not subsequently
been extensively investigated. The presence
of cholestasis, typical facies, peripheral pul￾monary stenosis, and posterior embryotoxon
suggested the diagnosis of Alagille's syndrome;

his mother was also observed to have the
typical facies of Alagille's syndrome, pruritus,
and characteristic voice, but she refused
further investigation. A liver biopsy at 21
months of age revealed a paucity of bile ducts
without fibrosis or histological signs of
cholestasis. The evolution of this patient's ill￾ness was characterised by almost complete
remission of the cholestasis (total bilirubin
5 mmol/l, direct bilirubin 0 mmol/l, yGT 3 X
normal, cholesterol 4'1 mmol/1). He receives
rifampicin for mild pruritus and fat soluble
vitamin supplementation, and is growing nor￾mally (weight 75th centile for age, height 50th
centile).
Discussion
Renal involvement was not a prominent feature
of early reports of Alagille's syndrome.' Since
then, a variety of non-specific findings has been
described, including azotaemia, urine concen￾tration defects, and nephrolithiasis. Mesangio￾lipidosis is common and while it most probably
relates to the hypercholesterolaemia that is
associated with chronic cholestasis,2-4 Alagille
and coworkers did not find a correlation with
the serum lipid levels.2 In addition, a variety of
abnormalities in renal morphogenesis has been
described, which include small kidneys,6 10 12
congenital single kidney,5 '0 microcystic tubular
dilatation with interstitial fibrosis,4 9-l1 and
renal Cysts.2 4 5 7 9 11 The association of cystic
kidney disease with Alagille's syndrome has
been reported infrequently (table 2), possibly
because of the poor definition of cysts using
older ultrasound equipment and the difficulty
in identifying early lesions by ultrasound.
Medullary cystic kidney disease was found at
necropsy in two patients with a partial form of
Alagille's syndrome,5 in one dying of sepsis
following liver transplantation at three years of
age,4 and in another who died at two months of
age in renal failure.I1 All other documented
cases of cystic kidney disease have been
described at necropsy, prompting some investi￾gators to question whether this finding may
suggest a poor prognosis in Alagille's syn￾drome.5 6 However, none of our three patients
has shown signs of deteriorating renal function,
while showing the full spectrum of possible
evolution of their cholestasis. This implies that
cystic kidney disease may not of itself indicate a
poor prognosis, but rather the type (simple cyst
versus nephronophthisis) and extent (unilateral
versus bilateral) of renal involvement that
governs the patient's prognosis.
Hyams and colleagues, in observing that
their patient did not have dysplastic changes in
either kidney, suggested that the findings in
Alagille's syndrome differed from other condi￾tions with cystic renal lesions associated with
biliary tract abnormalities such as Meckel's
syndrome, Jeune's syndrome, and Zellweger's
syndrome.9 Two of our patients presented pre￾natally with a unilateral multicystic dysplastic
kidney, suggesting that dysplastic kidneys may
also occur in this syndrome. Indeed, concen￾tric layering of mesenchymal cells around bile
ducts in early Alagille's syndrome was sug￾gested to be superficially reminiscent of
changes observed in dysplastic kidneys. 13
Desmet hypothesised that a defect in epithe￾lial-mesenchymal inductive interactions in
early gestation may explain the coexistence of
biliary and renal cystic abnormalities in a
variety of inherited malformation syndromes
associated with fibrocystic cholangiopathy and
abnormal remodelling of the primitive ductal
plate.'4 In some, progression of the disease
leads to ductal degeneration and involution.
He suggested that because intrahepatic paucity
of interlobular bile ducts is not associated with
renal lesions, the cause and mechanism of bile
duct destruction is probably different from
those disorders associated with congenital
hepatic fibrosis. Our observations, together
with other reports of abnormalities in renal
morphogenesis with Alagille's syndrome,
suggest that a defect in epithelial-mesenchymal
induction may also be responsible for the con￾stellation of abnormalities in this disorder. The
lack of reports of ductal plate malformation
does not necessarily exclude Alagille's syn￾drome from Desmet's hypothesis. Rather this
may merely reflect a slower, less aggressive
hepatic disease process that allows more com￾plete ductal plate remodelling to occur, while
in other organs more severe disturbances arise
in early development, giving the typical post￾natal pattern of malformations of Alagille's
syndrome. The cause of such failures of induc￾tion is likely to be multifactorial and may
include differences in the expression of genes
regulating inductive interactions. Such differ￾ences may account for the variability of clinical
expression of inherited disorders with biliary
and renal manifestations.
In conclusion, Alagille's syndrome belongs
in the spectrum of disorders associated with
cystic renal disease and thus expands the dif￾ferential diagnosis of multicystic kidney
detected by prenatal ultrasound. Cystic
dysplastic kidneys may be included in the

order to determine the prevalence of cystic
