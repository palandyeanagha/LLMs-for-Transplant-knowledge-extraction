We report an unusual histologic manifestation of light chain deposition disease in a 69-year-old female patient,
who presented with nephrotic syndrome and an increased serum creatinine. The renal biopsy findings by light
and electron microscopy suggested a glomerulonephritis with massive immune-complex deposition, such as
lupus nephritis. However, the overall clinical scenario was inconsistent with lupus. Subsequent tests revealed
multiple myeloma confirmed by bone marrow biopsy and identification of a monoclonal kappa light chain
immunoglobulin by serum and urine immunoelectrophoresis and immunofixation. Additional immunohisto￾chemistry of the first biopsy also demonstrated strong kappa light chain staining of the glomerular capillary
walls and mesangium but not lambda light chain or IgG staining. The patient responded well to therapy and was
asymptomatic until nearly 7 years later. A repeat biopsy revealed similar findings to the first biopsy with the
addition of immunofluorescence microscopy, which confirmed the prominent kappa light chain staining of the
glomeruli, tubular basement membranes, and interstitium with corresponding electron-dense deposits
visualized by electron microscopy. This case represents an unusual histologic variant of light chain deposition
disease, which to our knowledge has not been previously described and further expands the wide
clinicopathologic spectrum within the diagnostic entity of light chain deposition disease.

Light chain deposition disease has been found in
10% of renal biopsies of patients with an underlying
monoclonal gammopathy.1 Patients with this dis￾ease may have clinical presentations of proteinuria,
renal insufficiency, or both. The histologic features
are frequently characterized by nodular glomerulo￾sclerosis, but a wide spectrum of glomerular
changes has been described which ranges from an
absence of histologic changes by light microscopy,
indistinguishable from minimal change disease, to
variable degrees of mesangial alterations, to mem￾branoproliferative glomerulonephritis.2–9 Immuno￾fluorescence microscopy or immunohistochemical
localization is essential for establishing the diag￾nosis of light chain deposition disease, which is
characterized by monoclonal deposition of either
kappa or lambda light chains, but not both, in
glomerular and tubular basement membranes, me￾sangium, interstitium, and vessel walls. Electron
microscopy typically demonstrates granular elec￾tron-dense deposits, often with a confluent ap￾pearance, involving the glomerular and tubular
basement membranes.
In this report, we present a rare variant of light
chain deposition disease with histologic features
that mimic a glomerulonephritis with massive
immune-complex deposition. Cases with similar
ultrastructural features but with deposits of mono￾clonal immunoglobulins have been recently de￾scribed and have been proposed to comprise a
unique clinicopathologic entity.10 An alternate per￾spective suggested by our case is that cases of
monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition and pre￾dominantly light chain deposition disease with
ultrastructural features of immune-complex glomer￾ulonephritis represent an overlapping clinical and
pathologic spectrum, similar to what has previously
been encountered in other glomerulopathies Received 2 August 2004; revised and accepted 29 November 2004;

associated with lymphoplasmacytic disorders. A
particular example of such an overlapping pattern
of renal injury would be nodular glomerulosclerosis,
which can be encountered in heavy chain deposi￾tion disease (no or minimal light chain deposits
present), monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition
disease (both light and heavy immunoglobulin
chain deposits present), and light chain deposition
disease (no immunoglobulin heavy chain present).
Despite the unique histologic and ultrastructural
features of the case presented below, the corre￾sponding clinical features fall within the reported
experience of light chain deposition disease and
suggest that our case expands the pathologic
spectrum of this diagnostic category rather than
representing a new diagnostic entity.
Materials and methods
Standard procedures were used to process formalin￾fixed tissue for light microscopic evaluation. The
sections were approximately 2 mm in thickness.
Hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid Schiff, and
Jones methenamine silver stains on three level
sections and a Masson trichrome stain on one level
section were obtained for both biopsy specimens.
Owing to the absence of diagnostic glomeruli in
the tissue submitted for immunofluorescence micro￾scopy, immunohistochemistry was performed on the
formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue sec￾tions of the first biopsy. We used the protocol
published on the Renal Pathology Society website
(http://www.renalpathsoc.org/000R000R.htm). The
sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. A
limited antibody panel consisting of IgG, kappa light
chain, and lambda light chain (DAKO Corporation,
Carpinteria, CA, USA) was performed.
Standard immunofluorescence microscopy was
performed on 4 mm frozen tissue sections of the
second biopsy stained with polyclonal fluorescein
isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies to IgG, IgA,
IgM, C3, C1q, kappa light chains, lambda light
chains, fibrinogen, and albumin (DAKO). The
immunofluorescence staining was scored on a
semiquantitative scale from 0 to 4 þ .
Standard procedures were applied to evaluate the
renal specimens using a Philips EM410LS electron
microscope. A magnification of up to  38 000 was
used to exclude the presence of substructural
organization within the electron-dense deposits.
The use of the term plasma cell dyscrasia refers to
monoclonal proliferations of plasma cells or plas￾macytoid lymphocytes, which are frequently char￾acterized by the secretion of a monoclonal
immunoglobulin component. The term multiple
myeloma is used specifically when the clinical
and/or pathologic criteria have been satisfied, as
enumerated by the World Health Organization
Classification of Tumours of Haematopoietic and
Lymphoid Tissues.11
Clinical history
This 69-year-old female patient with a past medical
history of well-controlled hypertension for 20 years
presented with headaches and increasing hyperten￾sion, dyspnea, orthopnea, and edema involving the
face and upper and lower extremities. A serum
creatinine was 3.3 mg/dl (442 mmol/l), 1 month prior
to her initial presentation. Her blood pressure was
221/115 mmHg, which decreased to 110/55 mmHg
with aggressive angiotensin-converting enzyme in￾hibitor treatment following her presentation.
Laboratory data were noteworthy for: blood urea
nitrogen, 70 mg/dl (25 mmol/l); creatinine, 5.0 mg/dl
(442 mmol/l); calcium, 8.2 mg/dl (2.1 mmol/l); hema￾tocrit, 23%; and albumin, 2.9 mg/dl (29 g/l). A 24-h
urine protein excretion totaled 5.8 g. Creatinine
clearance was 5 ml/min (0.08 ml/s). A chest X-ray
showed pulmonary edema. An echocardiogram
demonstrated an ejection fraction of 45–50% with
mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and pulmonary
hypertension. A renal ultrasound showed normal￾sized right and left kidneys. Serology for hepatitis A
IgG was positive, but hepatitis A IgM was negative.
Serologies for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, anti-neutro￾phil cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-glomerular base￾ment membrane antibodies, rheumatoid factor, and
HIV were negative. C3 complement component was
62 mg/dl (normal: 75–161 mg/dl), and C4 comple￾ment component was 21 mg/dl (normal: 16–47 mg/
dl) Antinuclear antibodies were positive at 1:40
with a speckled pattern. Serum cryoglobulins were
not tested. A diagnostic renal biopsy was performed.
Renal biopsy #1 pathology
The histologic sample contained approximately 10
glomeruli per level section. The glomeruli showed
massive accumulation of eosinophilic material with
a confluent appearance permeating the subendothe￾lial aspect of the glomerular basement membranes,
reminiscent of massive ‘wire-loop’ deposits, more
typical of lupus nephritis, but also involving
mesangial areas (Figure 1). The eosinophilic materi￾al focally appeared to occlude the lumina of a few
capillary loops. There was rare splitting of the
glomerular basement membranes. The glomeruli
demonstrated accentuation of the lobular architec￾ture, but nodular glomerulosclerosis or mesangial
hypercellularity was not prominent. Crescent for￾mation or necrosis of glomerular tufts was not
identified. There was diffuse interstitial fibrosis
with a mild degree of tubular atrophy and associated
mild interstitial mononuclear cell inflammation.
The arteries showed moderate intimal sclerosis
without evidence of vasculitis. The arterioles were
not prominent. A Congo red stain was negative for
amyloid. The tissue submitted for immunofluores￾cence microscopy contained renal medulla only
without diagnostic glomeruli, and immunofluores￾cence studies were not performed. A limited panel

of immunohistochemistry performed on the forma￾lin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections demonstrated
strong kappa light chain staining for mesangial
areas and the glomerular and tubular basement
membranes (Figure 2), but IgG and lambda light
chain were both negative. Electron microscopy of
three representative glomeruli showed massive
accumulations of electron-dense material in sub￾endothelial regions of the peripheral capillary walls
and in mesangial areas (Figure 3). The electron￾dense deposits lacked substructural organization.
Endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions were not
identified. Examination of the tubular basement
membranes and interstitium showed no evidence
of electron-dense deposits similar to those seen in
the glomeruli.
Clinical follow-up
A bone marrow biopsy performed subsequent to the
renal biopsy demonstrated 30% plasma cells and
both serum and urine immunoelectrophoresis and
immunofixation electrophoresis revealed a mono￾clonal kappa light chain immunoglobulin. The
amount of protein was not quantitated in the urine.
No lytic bone lesions were identified by a skeletal
X-ray survey. The patient received a regimen of
melphalan and prednisone over the next 8–10
months. However, this regimen was halted after
only three cycles due to numerous complications,
including bleeding, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia,
and several episodes of sepsis. During this period,
she was anuric, but 3 months after the renal biopsy
there was recommencement of urine production. At
2 months after this resumption of urine output, her
creatinine clearance was 18 ml/min and total urine
protein declined to 1.5 g/24 h. Dialysis was stopped
shortly thereafter and the serum creatinine returned
to a baseline of 1.0–1.2 mg/dl (88.4–106.1 mmol/l). A
repeat bone marrow biopsy at that time revealed 5%
plasma cells. Several bone marrow biopsies over the
next several years were negative for a plasma cell
neoplasm, of which some were confirmed by flow
cytometry. Regular testing of serum and urine
immunofixation electrophoresis were negative for a
monoclonal immunoglobulin. Of note, the patient
developed overt diabetes mellitus approximately 2
years prior to the second renal biopsy. Her blood

glomerulus exhibits massive accumulation of amorphous eosino￾philic material both in mesangial areas and along the suben￾dothelial aspect of glomerular basement membranes,
indistinguishable from massive ‘wire-loop’ type deposits that
can be encountered in lupus nephritis (Jones silver methena￾mine).
Figure 2 First biopsy. Immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections
for kappa light chain (counterstained with hematoxylin) demon￾strates strong staining of the glomerular capillary walls, mesan￾gium, Bowman’s capsule, and adjacent tubular basement

of similar renal structures.

glucose and hemoglobin A1C levels initially showed
persistent elevation, but have subsequently normal￾ized with administration of glyburide and diet
control.
At 2 months prior to a second renal biopsy, a
serum protein electrophoresis showed a new finding
of hypogammaglobulinemia. At 1 month prior to
this repeat biopsy, she developed lower extremity
edema and her urinalysis demonstrated 3 þ protein.
Laboratory tests revealed a serum creatinine of
1.7 mg/dl (150.3 mmol/l) and albumin of 2.0 mg/dl
(20 g/l). Her dyspnea worsened and her headaches
returned. A chest X-ray revealed pleural effusions,
and an abdominal ultrasound showed normal sized
kidneys, but ascites was present. The 24-h urine
showed a creatinine clearance of 34 ml/min
(0.57 ml/s) and total protein excretion of 13.5 g.
Subsequent serologic tests for ANA were negative
and serum complement levels were normal. At 83
months after the initial renal biopsy, a second renal
biopsy was performed. Both serum and urine
immunofixation electrophoresis studies demon￾strated a monoclonal kappa light chain immuno￾globulin.
Renal biopsy #2 pathology
The second biopsy contained 36–58 glomeruli per
level section for light microscopic evaluation.
Approximately 30% of these glomeruli were glob￾ally sclerotic. The remaining glomeruli demon￾strated massive accumulations of eosinophilic
material in mesangial regions and in subendothelial
portions of glomerular capillary walls similar to the
first biopsy (Figure 4). There was accentuation of the
lobular architecture due to the massive accumula￾tions of eosinophilic material, but nodular glomer￾ulosclerosis and mesangial hypercellularity were
not prominent features. Glomerular inflammatory
cell influx, crescent formation, or necrosis of
glomerular tufts was not identified. The tubulointer￾stitial compartment showed patchy, mild interstitial
fibrosis and tubular atrophy. The arteries showed
moderate intimal sclerosis and the arterioles demon￾strated frequent subendothelial hyalinosis. A Congo
red stain was negative for amyloid. Immunofluores￾cence microscopy of 14 glomeruli revealed diffuse
and strong staining (4 þ /4 þ ) of the glomeruli in
mesangial areas and glomerular basement
membranes for kappa but not lambda light chains
(Figure 5a). The tubular basement membranes and
interstitium showed patchy and strong staining for
kappa light chains (4 þ /4 þ ) (Figure 5b), but not
lambda light chains. C3 stained the glomeruli
diffusely similar to kappa light chains but less
intensely (2–3 þ /4 þ ). There was weak (less than 1
þ /4 þ ) and segmentally distributed linear staining
of the glomerular basement membranes for IgG.
There was no significant glomerular staining for
IgA, IgM, C1q, lambda light chains, fibrinogen, or
albumin. Ultrastructural studies demonstrated mas￾sive accumulation of electron-dense deposits iden￾tical in appearance to those seen in the first biopsy
in subendothelial locations along the glomerular
basement membranes and more focally in sube￾pithelial locations as well. These deposits extended
prominently into mesangial areas. Examination of
the interstitium and peritubular capillaries showed
occasional aggregates of similar electron-dense
deposits (Figure 6). The tubular basement mem￾branes revealed ill-defined electron-dense material,
which could represent either cellular debris or
immune complexes. The final diagnosis was light
chain deposition disease, of monoclonal kappa light
chain type.
Clinical follow-up #2
A bone marrow biopsy around the time of the
second renal biopsy revealed a clonal kappa light
chain restricted plasma cell neoplasm, which was
confirmed by flow cytometry. There remained no
lytic bone lesions visualized by MRI. She was being
treated with thalidomide and doing well with the
exception of some neuropathy. At 7 months after
the second renal biopsy, her serum albumin was
4.1 mg/dl (41 g/l) and a spot urine protein decreased
to 285.5 mg/dl with a urine creatinine of 41 mg/dl.
Her serum creatinine was approximately 2.7 mg/dl
(238.7 mmol/l), and she remained on hemodialysis
(2 days per week).
Discussion
Light chain deposition disease is the most common
entity under the broad classification of monoclonal
immunoglobulin deposition disease, which also

accumulations of amorphous eosinophilic material in suben￾dothelial regions, identical to the first biopsy (Jones silver
methenamine).

consists of light and heavy chain deposition disease
and heavy chain deposition disease.12,13 It has been
over 30 years since the early descriptions of light
chain deposition disease in 1973 by Antonovych
et al14 with additional characterization by Randall
et al4 in 1976. Light chain deposition disease is
thought to affect 3–5% of patients with underlying
multiple myeloma or other plasma cell dyscra￾sia.15,16 In 30% of light chain deposition disease
cases, there is an absence of an underlying plasma
cell dyscrasia or lymphoproliferative disorder by
histologic examination despite the presence of a
monoclonal gammopathy.17
The most common glomerular histopathological
lesion in light chain deposition disease is nodular
glomerulosclerosis, which is present in 55–100% of
renal biopsies within some series.1,3,13 The histolo￾gic spectrum of light chain deposition disease can be
quite variable, and ranges from minimal glomerular
changes with or without glomerular deposits to
membranoproliferative or mesangial proliferative
glomerulonephritis.2–9 These lesions can occur in￾dependently of nodular glomerulosclerosis but often
occur concomitantly with nodular glomerulosclero￾sis in the same biopsy. All of these histologic
subtypes can occur with or without crescents.5
Since the first description of light chain deposi￾tion disease, over 150 cases have been documented
in the English language medical literature.2–7,10,18–23
Despite the common occurrence of light chain
deposition disease, our current case represents a
unique manifestation of light chain deposition
disease with histologic and ultrastructural features
that resemble a massive immune-complex deposi￾tion form of glomerulonephritis, which has not been
previously reported to our knowledge. Nodular
accentuation of the glomerular tuft architecture
was present focally in both biopsies, but this feature
was overshadowed by the prominent accumulation
of amorphous eosinophilic material corresponding
to the prominent electron-dense deposits involving
all mesangial regions and glomerular capillary loops.
Figure 5 Immunofluorescence microscopy of the second biopsy. (a) A representative glomerulus shows diffuse and strong confluent
kappa light chain staining of the glomerular capillary walls and mesangium. There is no significant staining of Bowman’s capsule,
tubular basement membranes in this region, unlike the region depicted in (b). No staining for lambda light chains was observed in the
glomeruli, tubular basement membranes, or interstitium (not shown). (b) There is patchy and strong kappa light chain staining of the
tubular basement membranes and interstitium.
Figure 6 Second biopsy. There are prominent aggregates of
electron-dense deposits focally present in the interstitium (arrows
point to some of the many deposits present). Glomerular deposits
identical to those seen in Figure 3 were uniformly present but not
illustrated in this field (electron microscopy, original magnifica￾tion  2600).

The light microscopic findings considered in
isolation were most suggestive of an immune￾complex-mediated glomerulonephritis, such as lu￾pus nephritis. The prominent eosinophilic material
in the subendothelial aspects of the glomerular
basement membranes most closely resembled the
‘wire-loop’ deposits of focal or diffuse proliferative
glomerulonephritis in systemic lupus erythemato￾sus. In fact, the constellation of histologic and
ultrastructural findings in conjunction with the
positive ANA titer and the absence of immunofluor￾escence microscopy led to an initial provisional
diagnosis of lupus nephritis in this patient’s initial
biopsy. However, the clinical presentation and the
absence of endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions
detectable by electron microscopy argued against
the diagnosis of lupus nephritis at that time. The
patient’s proteinuria and abnormal ANA titer satis￾fied only two of four criteria in the 1982 American
Rheumatism Association criteria for the classifica￾tion of lupus that were necessary to establish a
diagnosis. Subsequent immunohistochemistry of the
first biopsy and immunofluorescence microscopy of
the second biopsy confirmed the absence of IgA,
IgM, C1q, or significant levels of IgG deposition and
demonstrated strong staining only for kappa light
chains, thereby establishing the diagnosis of light
chain deposition disease.
Weak segmental and linear staining of some of the
glomerular basement membranes for IgG by immu￾nofluorescence microscopy was also present. We
believe this pattern of weak, linear IgG staining,
distinct from the strong, diffuse and confluent
staining for kappa light chain, most likely represents
a nonspecific finding consequent to altered affinities
of the damaged capillary wall similar to that
frequently observed in diabetic nephropathy and
some allograft kidneys. In view of the patient’s 2-
year history of diabetes, it is likely that the IgG
staining is a manifestation of the weak linear
staining of glomerular capillary walls for IgG that
is commonly encountered in renal biopsies of
patients with diabetes mellitus. In support of this
interpretation, the large glomerular and interstitial
deposits, tubular basement membranes, and inter￾stitium were noticeably negative for IgG but strongly
positive for kappa light chains by immunofluores￾cence microscopy. Finally, this patient’s urine or
serum protein immunoelectrophoresis and immu￾nofixation electrophoresis studies have detected
only kappa light chains but not an IgG component
of the monoclonal immunoglobulin.
This case is of particular interest in view of a
series of cases recently reported by Nasr et al,
10
describing a purportedly new clinicopathologic
entity with essentially identical ultrastructural
features to our current case.10 They collected 10 cases
that demonstrated monoclonal IgG deposits with
histologic and ultrastructural features mimicking
an immune-complex glomerulonephritis. Notably,
the immunoglobulin deposition involved only the
glomeruli and not the interstitium or tubular base￾ment membranes. Five of the patients had a
detectable monoclonal protein by either serum or
urine protein electrophoresis, but despite extensive
workups, none of these patients had additional
evidence of an underlying multiple myeloma or
plasma cell dyscrasia. In their report, Nasr et al
reviewed the literature and found at least four
additional cases which demonstrated light and
heavy chain deposition disease and massive im￾mune-complex type deposits in patients without an
underlying hematopoietic disorder.7,24–26
Our case is noteworthy for its expansion of the
spectrum of clinicopathologic findings that may be
encountered in glomerulopathies attributable to a
monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disorder
but whose pathologic features mimic a proliferative
glomerulonephritis of immune-complex type.
First, our patient had a 7-year history of multiple
myeloma, well documented by bone marrow biopsy,
in contrast to the patients of Nasr et al10 who lacked
evidence of overt neoplasia. Second, immunofluor￾escence studies demonstrated a light chain deposi￾tion process, with a corresponding circulating
monoclonal kappa chain detectable by serum and
urine immunoelectrophoresis and immunofixation
studies, rather than a monoclonal immunoglobulin
composed of both light and heavy chains. Finally,
the deposition process in the present case was not
limited to the glomeruli, but also involved the
tubular basement membranes and interstitium. In
our review of the literature, we have identified one
case of light and heavy chain deposition disease
with a documented history of myeloma, which
demonstrated prominent granular electron-dense
deposits, in addition to those cases with such
deposits that have been reported previously or
reviewed by Nasr et al.
10,27 Although the histologic
features in this last case showed nodular glomerulo￾sclerosis rather than a proliferative glomerulone￾phritis, we believe that all of these reported cases,
including our present case, represent the wide
histologic spectrum that can be encountered within
the broad category of monoclonal immunoglobulin
deposition disease.
Although based on a single case, our clinical
follow-up data of 7 years indicates that this variant
may represent a less aggressive form of light chain
deposition disease, which typically has a median
patient survival and renal survival time of 49–69
months and 2 years, respectively.13,17
In summary, this report illustrates an unusual
clinical and histologic presentation of light chain
deposition disease, further expanding the histologic
spectrum that is already recognized within the
categories of monoclonal immunoglobulin deposi￾tion disease and, specifically, light chain deposition
disease. Although the histologic features are un￾usual, the combination of clinical information with
the morphologic evaluation established the diagno￾sis of light chain deposition disease. The 7-year
Light chain deposition disease variant

clinical follow-up suggests that this variant may
have a less aggressive clinical course than the usual
form of light chain deposition disease, but addi￾tional follow-up of this and other cases are neces￾sary to establish the clinical significance of this rare
variant.
