Abstract
Background: Locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is unsuitable for standard locoregional
therapies, remains a challenge to manage. Among the recently developed treatments, proton beam therapy (PBT)
has been reported to achieve good local control. However, in patients with large HCC adjacent to the esophagus,
high-dose PBT may rarely lead to radiation-induced esophageal necrosis or perforation. Furthermore, the optimal
strategy to safely treat these fatal complications remains unclear.
Case presentation: A 49-year-old man who was diagnosed with a large (16 cm) HCC in the right lobe with tumor
thrombosis in the main trunk of the portal vein (PVTT) received high-dose hypofractionated PBT in another hospital.
A total dose of 66 GyE in 10 fractions was administered to the primary tumor and the PVTT. After 5 months, a 1-cm
solitary nodule was noted in the upper lobe of the right lung. Therefore, sorafenib was started. About 6 months
after the PBT, lower esophageal mucosal inflammation that progressed to an ulcer was noted. About 7 months after
the PBT, the lower esophagus developed full-thickness necrosis. Therefore, emergency thoracoscopic
esophagectomy was performed, followed by two-stage reconstruction 2 months later. The operation and
postoperative clinical course were mostly uneventful, except for a minor anastomotic leakage. The outcome of the
primary HCC, including the PVTT, was graded as a complete response, which has been maintained for 51 months
after the PBT.
Conclusion: PBT is a promising option for patients with locally advanced HCC; however, for large tumors adjacent
to the esophagus, ischemic esophageal necrosis due to antiangiogenic effects may occur, particularly with the
combined use of PBT and sorafenib. In such a life-threatening condition, the thoracoscopic esophagectomy and the
two-stage reconstruction are a safe option that can prevent critical postoperative complications due to the poor
general condition, effects of PBT on the remnant gastric conduit, and use of sorafenib.

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most
common cancers in the world and is especially prevalent
in Asia and Africa. In contrast to other cancers, HCC
may be treated with various modalities, such as surgical
resection, liver transplantation, transcatheter arterial
chemoembolization, radiofrequency ablation, sorafenib,
and external beam radiation therapy (ERBT), as enlisted
in the current clinical guidelines [1–3]. Despite the re￾cent progress in these HCC treatments, strategies for lo￾cally advanced tumors that are unsuitable for standard
locoregional therapies remain a challenging area.
Proton beam therapy (PBT) is a type of ERBT that
uses charged particles and can increase energy depos￾ition at a penetration depth of up to a sharp maximum
to form the so-called Bragg peak [4]. Compared with
standard photon beams, PBT can distribute tumoricidal
doses without aggravating toxicity in the adjacent nor￾mal organs. Therefore, PBT has been reported to achieve
good local control and less toxicities for patients with lo￾cally advanced HCC, such as those presenting as large
tumors [5] and those with portal vein tumor thrombosis
(PVTT) [6] or inferior vena cava tumor thrombus [7].
However, in patients with an HCC adjacent to the
gastrointestinal (GI) tract, a high dose of PBT may cause
radiation-induced ischemic bowel complications or
bowel perforation. In addition, a combination of radio￾therapy (RT) and sorafenib, which is a potent multiki￾nase inhibitor with antiangiogenic and antiproliferative
properties, may result in a higher risk for serious bowel
complications secondary to delayed microvasculature re￾covery, compared to that expected with either treatment
alone [8].
This study reported a case of radiation-induced
esophageal necrosis after complete response in a patient
with large HCC involving PVTT in the main trunk who
was treated with PBT followed by sorafenib; the case
was successfully treated via thoracoscopic esophagec￾tomy and two-stage reconstruction.
Case presentation
A 49-year-old man was diagnosed with a 16-cm bulky
HCC in the right lobe (Fig. 1a) with PVTT in the main
trunk (Fig. 1b). We attempted curative surgical resection
initially, but collateral vessels in the hepatoduodenal
ligament were noted intraoperatively. Substantial
hemorrhage was assumed; therefore, the treatment for
the primary tumor and the PVTT was converted to
high-dose hypofractionated PBT for a total dose of 66
GyE in 10 fractions, which were administered in another
hospital (Fig. 2a). There was no acute toxicity exceeding
grade 1. After 5 months of PBT completion, the outcome
of the primary HCC, including the PVTT, was graded as
a complete response (CR), according to the response
evaluation criteria in solid tumors (Fig. 2b). However, a
1-cm solitary pulmonary nodule was noted in the right
upper lobe on computed tomography (CT). Therefore,
daily oral sorafenib (800 mg) was administered as
molecular-targeted drug therapy.
About a month after the initiation of sorafenib, the pa￾tient complained of heartburn. Upper endoscopy re￾vealed mucosal inflammation in the lower esophagus
(Fig. 3a), and a proton-pump inhibitor was started for
reflux esophagitis. After 1 more month, the esophageal
lesion progressed to a severe ulcer. After hospitalization,
sorafenib was discontinued, and the patient was placed
on nothing per orem. On day 7 after the admission, the
esophageal ulcer progressed to full-thickness necrosis
(Fig. 3b), and CT revealed a wall defect on the right side
of the lower esophagus (Fig. 3c). Based on these findings,
the patient was diagnosed as necrotic perforation of the
lower esophagus.
He underwent emergency thoracoscopic esophagec￾tomy in a prone position. Intraoperatively, the right

lower mediastinal pleura and diaphragm around the ir￾radiation field were noted to have thickened and devel￾oped a yellowish-white color, indicating ischemic
changes (Fig. 4a). The right pleural cavity contained ser￾ous pleural effusion. The right lower esophageal wall
above the diaphragm showed full-thickness hypovascular
necrosis (Fig 4b), and both crura of the diaphragm were
inflamed and strongly adherent to the esophagus. We
performed subtotal esophagectomy combined with par￾tial diaphragmatic crus resection. Since the necrotic
changes in the serosa extended into the gastric cardia,
simultaneous resection of the upper stomach was un￾avoidable. A gastric conduit was made using the macro￾scopically intact region and was pulled up and through
the subcutaneous route. We decided to avoid performing
simultaneous esophagogastrostomy, considering the
poor general condition, the effect of PBT to the remnant
stomach, and the sorafenib use. Finally, external esopha￾gostomy was created in the neck, followed by placement
of a gastrostomy tube for drainage and a jejunostomy
tube for postoperative enteral nutrition on the subcuta￾neous gastric conduit. The postoperative schema is
shown in Fig. 5.
Two months after the first surgery, anastomosis of the
remnant cervical esophagus and the gastric conduit was
performed as a two-stage operation. Minimal anasto￾motic leakage was observed on postoperative day (POD)
18 and was successfully managed by conservative ther￾apy. The patient was discharged on POD 44 without
other complications.
To date, the HCC with PVTT has been maintained on
prolonged CR for 51 months after the PBT, and the pul￾monary nodule has remained stable.
Discussion
We presented a case of bulky HCC with PVTT in the
main trunk that achieved local CR after hypofractionated
PBT. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network
guidelines of 2017 suggest that PBT may be appropriate
in specific situations of locoregional therapy; however,
treatment at centers with experience is recommended
[3]. PBT may be considered appropriate in cases with
unresectable, locally advanced, or recurrent HCC. Re￾cently, hypofractionated RT in approximately 10 frac￾tions has been attempted to reduce treatment duration,
give more convenience for patients, and increase the

biologic effect of RT. Hong et al. demonstrated that
high-dose hypofractionated PBT for HCC achieved a
high local control rate of 94.8% at 2 years and less tox￾icity rate of 2% [9]. Several studies are ongoing to inves￾tigate the impact of hypofractionated PBT on HCC
outcomes.
PBT-induced toxicity to the adjacent normal GI tract
was reported to be a rare complication; nevertheless, ser￾ious problems should be considered with caution [10].
The late toxicities of PBT to an adjacent GI tract are
caused by local micro ischemia, which can occur grad￾ually but is progressive; it may frequently occur after
more than half a year after PBT.
There were several reasons that may have caused the
esophageal necrosis in our case. First, the actual irradi￾ation may not have matched the planned dose distribu￾tion, especially for the lesion in contact with the
diaphragm, owing to respiratory motion. With the
planned dose distribution in our case, the esophagus
should have been hardly irradiated. However, because
the proton beam from the horizontal irradiation port
encompassed the nearby right lower lobe of the lung on
the level of the esophagogastric junction, a large respira￾tory motion might have displaced the actual irradiation
from the planned position of distal fall and Bragg peak.
Second, the administration of sorafenib at 5 months after
the PBT completion might have aggravated the esopha￾geal necrosis. Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, has ac￾tivities against Raf kinase and several receptor tyrosine
kinases, such as vascular endothelial growth factor re￾ceptor 2, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, FLT3,
Ret, and c-Kit, and inhibits tumor angiogenesis in HCC
[11]. A phase II trial showed that RT combined with so￾rafenib therapy achieved 55% complete or partial re￾sponse rate in patients with unresectable HCC [12].
Theoretically, the combination therapy is a promising
strategy and is expected to exert synergistic antiangio￾genesis effects; however, its treatment-related toxicity
has not been formally evaluated. The vascular endothe￾lial growth factor signaling pathway is needed for the re￾covery of PBT-induced microvasculature damage in
normal organs, but this pathway is blocked in patients
receiving sorafenib after PBT. Barney et al. reported that
9% of patients who received vascular endothelial growth
factor receptor inhibitor after stereotactic body radiation
therapy in 3–5 fractions developed grade 3–5 bowel
complications, such as ulcer or perforation [8]. In our
case, even if the proton dose applied to the esophagus
was low, the occurrence of ischemic esophageal necrosis
remained possible because of the synergistic antiangio￾genic effects of sorafenib and PBT. On the other hand, it
is noteworthy that Chen et al. demonstrated only one
case (2.8%) of > grade 3 bowel complication after com￾bined sorafenib therapy and RT in a conventional frac￾tion size ranging from 2.0 to 2.5 Gy [12]. Compared with
hypofractionated PBT, the use of conventional fraction
size during PBT may reduce the risk for ischemic bowel
complications in cases of large HCC adjacent to the GI
tract, like our case.
Esophageal necrosis or perforation is a life-threatening
condition. In this case, we safely completed the thoraco￾scopic esophagectomy and the two-stage reconstruction
for the extensive radiation-induced necrosis, which
spread from the lower esophagus to the upper stomach.

There have been only few studies regarding the use of
thoracoscopic treatment in such emergency settings.
Recently, the safety and efficacy of thoracoscopic man￾agement for severe spontaneous esophageal perfor￾ation were reported [13]. In the presence of strong
adhesions, fibrotic changes of the tissues or obscur￾ation of the anatomic layer structures are caused by
radiation therapies as seen in this case, and magnifica￾tion of thoracoscopy may help surgeons to identify the
dissection line between the fibrotic tissue and the ad￾jacent normal organ (Supplementary Fig. S1). A fur￾ther study is required to determine the efficacy of the
thoracoscopic approach for critical esophageal illness.
The transhiatal approach should be considered in
terms of minimally invasiveness, but in our case, with
wide spreading local necrosis and strong adhesion,
transthoracic approach would be suitable than trans￾hiatal esophagectomy which includes blind and blunt
dissections.
Two-stage esophagectomy has been reported as a safe
option that can prevent critical postoperative complica￾tions in patients with esophageal cancer at high risk
[14]. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding its
use in benign diseases, including esophageal necrosis.
Prolonged hospital stay, mental stress, and economic
burden are disadvantage of the procedure; therefore, a
reasonable indication is necessary. In this case, two-stage
operation was suitable for two reasons: First, septic risk
due to esophageal necrosis and anastomotic risk due to
the severe antiangiogenesis effect of PBT combined with
sorafenib could be separately managed by two-stage op￾eration. Second, some length of time was needed to ob￾serve whether the gastric conduit created showed
further progression of ischemia. Gastric conduit is not
generally created in the first stage of two-stage oper￾ation, and only esophagectomy, external esophagostomy,
and gastrostomy are performed. In this case, esophagec￾tomy and the creation of a gastric conduit were

esophagostomy. A gastrostomy tube for drainage and a jejunostomy tube for postoperative enteral nutrition are placed on the subcutaneous

performed at the same time in the first operation since
the gastric cardia could not be divided due to PBT￾induced damage of the upper stomach, and proximal
gastrectomy was unavoidable. The gastric conduit was
subsequently pulled up through the subcutaneous route
to be able to deal with further progression of ischemia.
Esophagogastrostomy was performed in the second op￾eration after confirming the stability of the gastric con￾duit. Our modified two-stage operation may be
beneficial when stomach damaged by radiation therapy
is intended to be used for reconstruction.
Conclusions
PBT is one promising option in patients with locally ad￾vanced HCC, but for large tumors adjacent to the GI
tract, it would be necessary to pay careful attention to
accurate radiation planning to avoid radiation-induced
bowel complications. Sorafenib administration after PBT
for HCC adjacent to the GI tract may inhibit microvas￾culature recovery and can lead to irreparable RT-related
bowel complications. Further improvements of PBT are
warranted, and patients should be carefully monitored
for the development of late-phase GI complications.
Additionally, in such a life-threatening condition, the
thoracoscopic esophagectomy and two-stage reconstruc￾tion are a safe option that can prevent critical postopera￾tive complications due to poor general condition, effects
of PBT to the remnant gastric conduit, and use of
sorafenib.
