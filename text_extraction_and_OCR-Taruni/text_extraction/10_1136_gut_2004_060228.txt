Background and aims: Several antibodies have been reported in the sera of patients with Crohn’s disease
(CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The most commonly described are anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannan
antibodies (ASCA) in CD and perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies (pANCA) in UC. Familial
clustering of these antibodies has been described, suggesting they might be genetic markers. Our aim was
to investigate the presence of these antibodies before the emergence of overt clinical manifestations.
Methods: Since 1980, the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) Medical Corps Serum Repository has stored serum
samples obtained systematically from 5% of all recruits on enlistment, and from the same population on
discharge from compulsory military service. We evaluated serum samples obtained from 32 subjects with
CD and eight with UC before they were clinically diagnosed, along with samples from matched controls.
Results: ASCA were present in 10/32 (31.3%) CD patients before clinical diagnosis compared with 0/95
(0%) controls (p,0.001). None of the eight patients with serum samples available before diagnosis of UC
were ASCA positive. ASCA was positive in 54.5% of patients after diagnosis of CD. The mean interval
between ASCA detection and diagnosis was 38 months. In 90% of patients, antibodies were detected in
the first available serum sample; therefore, measurements of the average time from the presence of ASCA
to diagnosis may be even longer. pANCA were present in 2/8 (25%) patients with available sera before
the diagnosis of UC. None of their 24 matched controls were positive (p = 0.014).
Conclusions: ASCA and pANCA may predict development of inflammatory bowel disease years before
the disease is clinically diagnosed.
Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are
common clinical subtypes of idiopathic inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD). These diseases are characterised
by excessive and tissue damaging inflammatory responses
of the gastrointestinal tract. Although the aetiology is
unknown, it is increasingly clear that these diseases represent
the outcome of three essential interactive cofactors: environ￾mental factors (for example, enteric microflora), multigenic
host susceptibility, and immune mediated tissue injury. A
variety of immune abnormalities have been described in IBD,
both at the systemic and intestinal levels. Several auto￾antibodies differentially associated with CD and UC have
been investigated in this respect.1 The most frequently
studied in clinical trials, anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae anti￾bodies (ASCA) and perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic
antibodies (pANCA), have been suggested as diagnostic
markers of the two diseases. The prevalence of these
antibodies among patients with confirmed IBD has been
well established. None the less, it is not known whether they
may precede the clinical diagnosis of IBD.
We evaluated a prospectively assembled collection of
frozen serum samples to test the hypothesis that the
appearance of ASCA and pANCA precedes the diagnosis of
IBD.
METHODS
Serum samples
Since 1980, the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) Military Corps
Serum Repository has stored serum samples obtained from
5% of all recruits on enlistment, and from the same
population on discharge from compulsory military service.
The sample selection process was systematic, included both
male and female soldiers, and was based on a numerical digit
code derived from the subject’s serial number. Samples were
stored at 220˚C.
The IDF computerised medical database was crosslinked
with the serum repository records in order to identify military
personnel diagnosed with CD or UC from 1980 to 2002.
Records containing these diagnoses from 115 persons with
sera in the repository were reviewed. Data on sex, ethnic
group, date of birth, and date and age at diagnosis were
obtained. Patients were excluded because of inadequate data,
insufficient evidence of a diagnosis of IBD (see below), or
absence of adequate serum samples. For each patient with at
least one blood sample taken before IBD diagnosis, three
controls were randomly selected from the repository records,
matched for sex, age (within one year), and day of
recruitment (for one of the CD cases only two controls were
identified). For patients with a blood sample(s) taken after
IBD diagnosis, two controls were randomly selected.
Review of medical records
The diagnosis of IBD was determined by review of medical
records. Diagnostic criteria included typical clinical features
of CD or UC and, in addition, at least one of the following: (a)
characteristic endoscopic findings; (b) characteristic radi￾ological features for CD in the small bowel; (c) macroscopic
evidence of disease at laparoscopy; and (d) histopathological

findings consistent with IBD. Patients with indeterminate
colitis were excluded.
The protocol was reviewed and approved by the Human
Use Committee of the IDF-Medical Corps. Informed consent
for the testing of the coded stored serum samples and review
of records by appropriate military personnel was waived. To
protect the privacy of the patients, their names and unique
personal information were not recorded or released. The date
of sampling and analyses ranged from 1980 to 2002.
Antibody assays
ASCA testing
Sera were analysed for ASCA expression in a blinded manner
using a fixed IgG and IgA ELISA assay, Aeskulisa (Aesku Lab,
Wendelsheim, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. In short, 100 ml of serum were added at a
dilution of 1:101 to 96 well polystyrene microtitre plates. The
plates are coated with highly purified mannan extracted from
the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Bound ASCA was detected
by incubation with horseradish peroxidase IgG or IgA
conjugate (goat antihuman). Unbound conjugate was
washed off, and addition of TMB substrate generated an
enzymatic colorimetric (blue) reaction which was stopped by
diluted acid (colour changes to yellow). Colour development
is proportional to concentrations of antibody present in sera.
Samples were read at 450 nm with a reference wavelength of
620 nm on a Anthes HT2 microtitre plate reader (Anthos;
Labtech Instruments, Salzburg, Austria). Diluted human sera
provided by the manufacturer served as internal controls. Six
calibrators were used (0, 3, 10, 100, 300 U/ml). The assays
were evaluated quantitatively by calculation of a standard
curve from the six calibrators. A sample was considered
positive when calculated at values .15 U/ml. For every
sample, two analyses on the same plate were carried out. Sera
exhibiting ASCA reactivity (IgG and/or IgA) exceeding the
normal reference range were termed ‘‘ASCA positive’’.
Antineutrophil cytoplasmic (atypical pANCA)
testing
Detection of pANCA was performed by an IIF technique on
ethanol fixed buffy coat leucocytes, as previously described.2
Briefly, samples were initially diluted to 1:20 in phosphate
buffered saline. An FITC conjugated rabbit antihuman IgG
antibody (Dako, Copenhagen, Denmark) was used for
detection of bound IgG antibodies. All slides were evaluated
by two independent observers; in the event of a difference in
opinion, a third observer was decisive. Staining patterns that
were considered ANCA positive were: perinuclear (pANCA)
and cytoplasmic (cANCA) staining of neutrophils. Samples
that were scored positive were further analysed by ELISA for
antiproteinase 3 (PR3) and antimyeloperoxidase (MPO)
antibodies, as described previously.2 Samples that were found
positive for PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA by ELISA were
excluded. These pANCA positive samples, negative to PR3,
MPO, and ANA, were considered as neutrophil specific
autoantibodies without a known molecular target, as
described in detail previously.3
Statistical analysis
Demographic characteristics of CD and UC patients were
described according to mean age, sex, and origin. Origin was
designated as Ashkenazi (European or American descent),
Sephardic (Asian or African descent), or Israeli (at least three
generations born in Israel).
Among CD patients in whom a prediagnostic serum sample
was available, we calculated matched odds ratios (ORs) for
having a positive ASCA test compared with controls. In order
to evaluate the time from ASCA formation to diagnosis of CD,
we determined the prevalence rate of ASCA positivity within
three time frames: more than 60 months, 37–60 months, and
36 or less before CD diagnosis. In this analysis we included all
serum samples available for each time frame (that is, patients
with two serum samples before CD diagnosis were included
twice in the analysis, unless both samples were from the
same time frame). By comparing each group to controls,
matched ORs for each time frame were calculated. Due to the
fact that none of the controls was positive for ASCA, the OR
was estimated by designating one positive control in each
case. All OR, 95% confidence intervals (CI), and p values of
these analyses were calculated applying the Mantel-Hanzsel
method for matched analysis. The geometric mean concen￾tration (GMC) of ASCA for all CD patients was calculated for
each time frame, and one way ANOVA was used to test for
the significance of time trend. We further calculated mean
time before diagnosis for all positive samples. In order to
calculate the accrual of ASCA positivity, a Kaplan-Meier
survival curve of all CD patients was plotted, beginning at
60 months before diagnosis up to 18 months after diagnosis.
For this analysis, a patient with a negative result was
considered to be negative up to that point, and was censored
at the time of the last available serum sample if it was also
negative. A patient with a positive result was considered to be
positive from that time onwards (until 18 months after
diagnosis). Median time for seropositivity was calculated. All
results are expressed as mean (SEM).
RESULTS
Patient population
A diagnosis of CD was established in 37 military personnel,
some formerly and some currently on active duty. Thirty
eight serum samples were available from 32 of these patients
before a diagnosis of CD was established. Of these 32 patients
88% were males, 47% were Ashkenazi Jews, 44% were
Sephardic Jews, and 9% were of Israeli descent. Mean (SEM)
age at diagnosis was 24.8 (0.9) years. The earliest available
serum sample for each patient was obtained a mean of 59
(4.4) months before the diagnosis, with a maximal interval
of 189 months to diagnosis. Eleven patients had post￾diagnosis serum samples taken from 1 to 28 months after
diagnosis.

A diagnosis of UC was established in 12 cases. Ten serum
samples were available from eight of these patients, before
diagnosis of UC was established. Of these 10 patients six were
Ashkenazi Jews, one was Sephardic, and three were of Israeli
descent. Mean (SEM) age at diagnosis was 23.5 (1.3) years.
The earliest available serum sample for each patient was
obtained a mean of 68 (17.7) months before the diagnosis,
with a maximal interval of 134 months. Serum samples
obtained after diagnosis (up to 53 months afterwards) were
also available from six patients.
ASCA prevalence in IBD patients and controls
CD patients
A total of 38 serum samples taken from 32 patients before
diagnosis and 113 samples from matched controls were
evaluated for ASCA antibodies. Ten of 32 (31.3%) CD patients
were positive for ASCA compared with 0/95 (0%) controls
(matched OR for having a positive test: cases v controls ‘
(95% CI 6.73–‘); p,0.001). By designating one control as
ASCA positive, the matched OR was 30.0 (95% CI 4.27–
1301.93). Of 11 patients with serum samples after diagnosis,
six (54.5%) were positive for ASCA. In all six cases in which
ASCA was positive after diagnosis of CD, ASCA were also
present in the prediagnostic serum samples.
UC patients
One of 12 UC patients was positive for ASCA (for this patient
the serum sample was obtained after the diagnosis of the
disease). One of 36 controls had a positive ASCA serum
sample.
Time from development of ASCA to diagnosis of CD
Table 1 describes the proportion of positive patients and
controls with serum available within three time frames
before and after diagnosis. The proportion of CD patients
with positive ASCA increased from 15.4% at over 60 months
before diagnosis to 36.8% within 36 months before diagnosis
(54.5% were positive after diagnosis). The OR for each time
frame is also presented in table 1.
In nine of 10 CD patients (90%) with positive ASCA before
diagnosis, antibodies were detected in the first available
serum sample. The other CD patient was negative 80 months
prior to diagnosis but tested positive at 48 months before
diagnosis. Overall, the mean interval between ASCA detec￾tion and diagnosis was 38 months (range 20–77 months).
Figure 1 demonstrates accrual of patients testing positive
in relation to the time of diagnosis. According to this analysis,
50% of CD patients were ASCA positive at 20 months before
diagnosis. As mentioned, in a substantial proportion of cases,
ASCA were present in the earliest available serum sample and
were therefore never documented as having been undetect￾able. To allow for patients with positive ASCA in the first
sample who may have been ASCA positive much earlier, we
used the Kaplan-Meier product limit curve to evaluate the
change in the proportion of patients with positive results over
time.
Figure 2 demonstrates the GMC of ASCA at different time
frames for all CD patients. GMC increased as the time of CD
diagnosis was approached, and further increased in samples
that were taken after diagnosis. This increase was statistically
significant (p = 0.029).
Table 2 depicts the evolution of ASCA levels in the
subgroup of ASCA positive CD patients in whom sera were
also available before diagnosis. As mentioned previously,
ASCA were also present in all six cases before diagnosis. In
4/6 patients there was a significant increase in ASCA levels
after diagnosis of disease compared with the prediagnostic
serum sample. In one patient there was no change in levels
(patient No 1) and in one patient (patient No 3) there was a
decreased level after diagnosis.
pANCA prevalence in IBD patients and controls
UC patients
Two of eight UC patients with available sera before diagnosis
were positive for pANCA antibodies (25%). None of their 24
matched controls were positive (p = 0.014). For six patients,
serum samples were available after diagnosis. Of these, one
patient was positive for pANCA (16.7%). None of the 12
matched controls was positive (p = 0.157).

DISCUSSION
It has recently been demonstrated in a variety of auto￾immune diseases that the appearance of specific serum
antibodies may precede the onset of clinical disease by many
years.4 These antibodies may not be directly responsible for
many of the manifestations of the disease, but are markers of
future disease in presently healthy individuals. A partial list
includes rheumatoid arthritis,5 systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE),6 and type I diabetes mellitus.7 In the case of SLE, a
concept of a crescendo of autoimmunity culminating in
clinical illness was formed.6 This concept is supported by data
showing increasing concentrations of autoantibodies before
diagnosis.6 8
The prospectively assembled IDF serum repository has
provided an opportunity to examine the development of
ASCA and pANCA before the onset of clinical illness in
patients with IBD. ASCA were present in a subgroup of CD
patients, years before the clinical onset of disease: 31.3% of
patients were ASCA positive before clinical diagnosis and
54.5% after diagnosis versus none in controls. Overall, the
mean interval between ASCA detection and diagnosis was
38 months (range 20–77). As in the majority of these subjects
the first serum sample was ASCA positive, this means that
the time interval was actually underestimated. In six patients
who were ASCA positive after clinical onset, serum samples
were also available before diagnosis. In all of these cases
ASCA were present in prediagnostic serum samples.
Our findings correlate with the previously observed
frequency of these antibodies in CD patients (40–70%).9–11
Despite modest sensitivity, several studies have found ASCA
expression (either IgA or IgG) to be nearly 95% specific for
CD.9 11 12
The reason for generation of ASCA remains unclear. ASCA
are detected through their reactivity with sequences of
mannose residues expressed in the cell wall mannan of
S cerevisiae.
13 It was hypothesised that increased permeability
in the small bowel of CD patients might lead to increased
exposure of yeast antigens (which are a resident part of the
normal intestinal flora) to immune reactive cells. Increased
permeability of the small bowel as an early event in the
pathogenesis of CD (before gross inflammatory damage to
the bowel wall is apparent) may also explain our findings of
the early appearance of ASCA. However, no association was
found between ASCA titres and permeability of the small
intestine, as measured by the cellobiose/mannitol test,14 or 51Cr/EDTA.15 Thus ASCA and increased permeability of the
small bowel are most likely independent phenomena in CD.16
ASCA have also been described as a genetic (or a familial)
marker in IBD. This is based on studies demonstrating ASCA
positivity in 20–25% of unaffected first degree relatives of
patients with CD.16–18 It was argued that whether the presence
of ASCA in these healthy relatives is genetically determined
or attributed to an environmental factor, it does not have any
clinical implication.1 As none of the studies provided long
term follow up on these subjects, no conclusion can be made
as to whether they actually remain unaffected in years to
come. We found that ASCA levels increased in asymptomatic
subjects as the time to diagnosis of CD approached (fig 2).
Therefore, the question relating to the clinical importance of
the presence of ASCA in an asymptomatic family member
may only be resolved by prospective studies with follow up of
ASCA titres, as well as clinical symptoms in these individuals.
Recent evidence suggests that ASCA serology may correlate
with particular clinical features, including young age at onset
of disease,16 ileal involvement,9 19 and development of
strictures and fistulae.20 Furthermore, ASCA have also been
associated with increased risk for early surgery (defined as
occurring within three years of diagnosis).21 22 Early identi￾fication of a rising titre of ASCA may help to identify a
subgroup of patients that might benefit from a more
aggressive approach with preventive medical therapy or
immunomodulation. This may alter the course of disease
and decrease the necessity for surgery.22
Should asymptomatic persons incidentally discovered to be
ASCA positive be monitored? Based on our findings it can be
argued that the presence of ASCA in asymptomatic subjects
may be in itself a predictor for future development of CD,
with the distinct pattern of clinical features, as described
above. This would be especially relevant for high risk
individuals, such as asymptomatic first degree family
members of CD patients. None the less, it is too early to
recommend a specific course of action until further data are
obtained through prospective clinical trials.
We were able to identify a relatively small number of UC
patients with available serum samples before diagnosis of
disease. pANCA were present in 25% of UC patients before
clinical diagnosis compared with none of the controls. In our
small cohort, only 1/6 patients (16.7%) were pANCA positive
after diagnosis. The accuracy of pANCA as a diagnostic tool
largely depends on the technique employed.3 23 A wide range
of sensitivities (from 0% to 63%) has been reported24
although, as in the case of ASCA for CD patients, the
specificity of pANCA for diagnosis of UC is high.
ANCA constitute a heterogenous group of antibodies which
are mainly directed against constituents of neutrophil
granules in patients with primary vascultides. The neutrophil
specific pANCA-like antibodies found in the sera of patients
with UC however seem to target many different neutrophil
antigens located in nuclei, granules, and cytosol.3 In UC,
serum pANCA are thought to reflect mucosal pANCA
production,25 thus implying that recognition of mucosal
antigen(s) is involved. Most studies do not support a
relationship between the presence or level of pANCA and
UC activity,26 and pANCA persist after total colectomy.27
Although our study reports only a small number of UC
patients, it clearly demonstrates that pANCA is present in a
subgroup of patients before clinical diagnosis.
In summary, our results demonstrate that clinical IBD is
preceded by the presence of specific antibodies for many
years before diagnosis. In the case of CD, we found a steady
increase in the percentage of ASCA positive cases as well as a
significant rise in levels of ASCA as time progresses, until
symptoms of clinical illness appear. This distinct pattern,
which is a common feature of autoimmune disease, under￾mines the current belief that ASCA are simply a genetic
marker of CD.
Thus the presence of ASCA in a high risk healthy
individual might be a marker for future development of CD
and may even predict the clinical course. A similar associa￾tion may exist for pANCA and UC.
