Abstract
Background: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, chronic interstitial lung disease that is unresponsive to
current therapy and often leads to death. However, the rate of disease progression differs among patients. We hypothesized
that comparing the gene expression profiles between patients with stable disease and those in which the disease
progressed rapidly will lead to biomarker discovery and contribute to the understanding of disease pathogenesis.
Methodology and Principal Findings: To begin to address this hypothesis, we applied Serial Analysis of Gene Expression
(SAGE) to generate lung expression profiles from diagnostic surgical lung biopsies in 6 individuals with relatively stable (or
slowly progressive) IPF and 6 individuals with progressive IPF (based on changes in DLCO and FVC over 12 months). Our
results indicate that this comprehensive lung IPF SAGE transcriptome is distinct from normal lung tissue and other chronic
lung diseases. To identify candidate markers of disease progression, we compared the IPF SAGE profiles in stable and
progressive disease, and identified a set of 102 transcripts that were at least 5-fold up regulated and a set of 89 transcripts
that were at least 5-fold down regulated in the progressive group (P-value#0.05). The over expressed genes included
surfactant protein A1, two members of the MAPK-EGR-1-HSP70 pathway that regulate cigarette-smoke induced
inflammation, and Plunc (palate, lung and nasal epithelium associated), a gene not previously implicated in IPF.
Interestingly, 26 of the up regulated genes are also increased in lung adenocarcinomas and have low or no expression in
normal lung tissue. More importantly, we defined a SAGE molecular expression signature of 134 transcripts that sufficiently
distinguished relatively stable from progressive IPF.
Conclusions: These findings indicate that molecular signatures from lung parenchyma at the time of diagnosis could prove
helpful in predicting the likelihood of disease progression or possibly understanding the biological activity of IPF.

Introduction
Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive
disease of unknown etiology that is characterized by irreversible
scarring in the lung. IPF is one of a subgroup of the diffuse
parenchymal lung diseases (DPLD) of unknown origin, represent￾ed by the idiopathic interstitial pneunomias (IIPs). IPF is the most
common form of IIP, and pathologically is represented by usual
interstitial pneumonia (UIP) [1–3]. While hypotheses have been
put forth, varying from chronic inflammation leading to
widespread fibrosis to abnormal wound healing and deregulated
epithelial cell function [4–9], the basic mechanism of disease
pathogenesis remains unknown.
Disease progression is highly variable in IPF. While the 3 to 5
year mortality is 50%, this is quite variable with some patients
living up to 10 years following diagnosis [10]. The disease course is
also variable, ranging from patients who remain stable for
protracted periods of time to others whom experience rapid
stepwise progression with accelerated mortality [11–13]. Although
predictors of survival [10] and disease progression [14] have
included demographic factors, exposures, lung physiology, radi￾ography, and pathology, it remains difficult to predict the
prognosis of any one case of IPF. Moreover, none of the
prediction models have accounted for differences in molecular
features of the pathological process.
Unfortunately, patients generally present in the later stages of
disease. And no medical treatment either reverses or slows the
progression of IPF. This heterogeneity of disease progression and
the lack of available treatment emphasize the importance of early
diagnosis, especially with the hope that intervention may be more

effective in the early stages of disease. This also underscores the
need for biomarkers which not only may predict progression but
may contribute to discovery of molecular mechanisms that are
involved in disease pathogenesis.
We hypothesized that by comparing the transcriptome of
relatively stable and progressive IPF, markers of disease activity
would be identified that could lead to biomarker discovery,
improved prognostic ability, and further contribute to the
understanding of IPF pathogenesis. In this study, we generated
the lung expression profiles from pre-treatment, diagnostic surgical
lung biopsies using SAGE technology [15] from 6 individuals with
relatively stable (or slowly progressive) IPF and compared these
profiles to 6 individuals with progressive IPF. In silico analyses of
the comprehensive SAGE profiles allowed for the generation of an
IPF molecular signature that distinguished relatively stable from
progressive patients, and identified genes not previously implicated
in IPF. Moreover, the SAGE IPF gene expression profile identified
molecular pathways that may be important in disease development
and progression.
Results
A summary of the clinical and demographic features are
presented in Table 1. The average age was 64.8 years in the
progressive group and 66.7 years in the relatively stable group.
Both groups included smokers and non-smokers. However, only
one female subject was present in the progressive group, whereas 3
were included in the relatively stable group (Table 1). The
percent predicted pulmonary function test (PFT) values at baseline
and end point for both groups are depicted in Figure 1. The
mean of the percent predicted PFT values at baseline are not
significantly different between both groups (Table 1). The actual
PFT values are depicted in Figure S1. A significant difference
between the progressive and the relatively stable group was found
for the actual change in DLCO and the change in percent
predicted DLCO with a P-value,0.05 based on a Mann-Whitney
test. Given that not all samples were collected at equal time
intervals between baseline and end point, a time-weighted factor
was calculated to assure the correct group assignment. The time￾weighted change in % predicted values between the two groups
was significantly different with P-values between 2.2E-3 (DLCO)
and 8.7E-3 (FVC).
IPF SAGE Transcriptome
For an in-depth assessment of the IPF transcriptome, we
generated and analyzed 12 IPF SAGE libraries with an average of
79,578 tags per library. A total of 954,932 transcript tags were
sequenced of which 168,272 were unique. After removal of linker
and repetitive sequences the number was reduced to 168,066.
Transcript tags with a raw count of one in the entire IPF
transcriptome (singletons) were also removed resulting in 149,291
transcripts. For comparison purposes, the tag counts in each
library were normalized to 200,000 tags. We also included 8 other
human lung tissue libraries comprising another 500,244 tags that
were downloaded from the SAGE Genie (http://cgap.nci.nih.
gov/SAGE) or the GEO website (http://ncbi/geo/). All libraries
included in this study are described in Table S1. Hierarchical
clustering analysis of the 12 IPF and 5 normal lung parenchyma
SAGE libraries included in this study demonstrated that IPF

samples are distinguishable from normal lung parenchyma
(Figure 2A). Three IPF samples are clustered together and are
dissimilar from the other 9 IPF samples indicating the possible
existence of other subtypes and reflecting the heterogeneity among
IPF patients. Though the three samples belong to the relatively
stable group (Table S1), it cannot be excluded that this separation
might be simply due to normal lung parenchyma present within
the surgically removed biopsy sample. We repeated the unsuper￾vised clustering with all 22 SAGE libraries available and noticed
that these particular three samples are still closer related to certain
normal tissue samples though the separation between IPF and
normal lung parenchyma is not as efficient as in the first analysis
(Figure S2A).
Initially, we compared the normal lung parenchyma libraries
NB1, NLP-1 and NLP-2 with the 12 IPF SAGE libraries in order
to identify genes that are over expressed in IPF and are minimally
expressed or absent in normal lung parenchyma. The filter applied
for each individual transcript tag selected for a P-value#0.05 and
a fold difference of at least 10; less than 2 counts in the normal
libraries; 10 or more counts in the IPF group; and an expression
level of at least 5 counts in 50% of all the IPF SAGE libraries,
which resulted in 1,121 transcript tags. The tag to gene mapping
was performed using SAGE Genie downloads and the tag to gene
classifications of the 1,121 transcript tags shows that 80% of the
tags can be mapped to well-defined transcripts, 5% match to
hypothetical proteins/open reading frames of unknown function
and 13% represent unknown transcripts (Figure 2B). A total of
18% of the significantly over expressed transcripts possibly
represent novel genes and/or alternative transcripts [16] uniquely
expressed in the IPF transcriptome. Careful analysis of the over
expressed genes in IPF revealed known genes that have been
shown to be highly expressed in IPF like S100 calcium binding
protein 2, chemokine CXC ligand 14, several collagens, tenascin,
metalloprotease 7, and fibronectin. These results confirm previ￾ously published IPF and normal expression profiles comparisons
[17–19]. However, our results also indicate that there are other
genes over expressed in our SAGE IPF libraries when compared to
normal lung with an unknown role in IPF pathogenesis like

syndecan 1(SDC1), suppression of tumorigenicity 5 (ST5,
regulator of MAPK1/ERK2 kinase) and centaurin delta 2
(CENTD2); all of which have been associated with lung
adenocarcinomas. Interestingly, we did not find significantly down
regulated genes in IPF compared to normal lung tissue.
Given that the IPF samples used in this study were selected
based on clinical variation in disease progression, we applied a
more stringent criteria in order to define a clear molecular
signature that would distinguish IPF from normal lung parenchy￾ma. We applied the above mentioned criteria and then selected for
the expression of at least 5 counts in more than 75% of all the IPF
SAGE libraries. This yielded a list of 293 transcripts tags of which
244 matched to well defined genes (Table S2). A T-test analysis
showed that the mean expression level of the 293 transcripts in IPF
differs significantly from the mean level in normal lung
parenchyma (P#2.7E-31). Furthermore, cluster analysis, including
five normal lung SAGE libraries (Table S1), indicated that this
signature is sufficient to separate IPF from normal lung by a single￾linkage hierarchical algorithm (Figure 2D), a clear improvement
in separation when compared with Figure 2A. Interestingly, even
when using all 22 SAGE libraries the 293-signature results in a
good separation of most IPF from the normal lung parenchyma
samples demonstrating the strength of the 293-signature (Figure
S2B).
Differentially expressed genes characterizing the
progressive and relatively stable disease groups in IPF
After establishing that our newly generated SAGE IPF
transcriptome contained sufficient information to distinguish IPF
from normal lung parenchyma and other lung diseases, we
analyzed the differential expression between progressive and
relatively stable IPF. The progressive and relatively stable groups
had 446,158 and 508,774 total SAGE tag counts respectively.
After applying a filter for a total sum of at least 2 or more tag
counts in both groups only 16,089 unique transcript tags were left
of which 13,745 were in common between the two groups; 1,268
were only present in the progressive group and 1,076 were only
present in the relatively stable group. To identify significant
differentially expressed transcript tags that distinguished the two
groups, we also selected for a fold difference $5, a minimal tag
count in the corresponding group $5 counts, and a P-value#0.05
resulting in 243 differentially expressed transcripts. As a final filter,
we selected for an expression level of 4 or more counts in at least
50% of the SAGE libraries representing either of the two groups.
In this way, we identified 102 transcripts up regulated and 89
down regulated transcripts in the progressive group (Figure 3A,
Table 2 and S3). The up regulated genes in the progressive
group includes surfactant protein A1 (SFTPA1) and also members
of the MAPK-EGR1-HSP70 pathway that regulates cigarette￾smoke induced inflammation [20]. Other up regulated genes are
ADM (adrenomedullin), CCL2 (chemokine ligand 2), PTPRF
(protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor F) and SPP1 (osteopontin).
Interestingly, we found 26 genes among the list of 102 up
regulated transcripts that are also associated with various cancers
like Heat shock 70KDa protein 1A (HSPA1A), Macropain
(PSMA7), Ras homolog gene family member B (RHOB), FK506
binding protein 2 (FKBP2) and Plunc (palate, lung and nasal
epithelium carcinoma associated). None of the above mentioned
genes, with the exception of SFTPA1, have been previously
correlated with disease progression in IPF. Other candidate
molecular biomarkers, not necessarily previously implicated in IPF
pathogenesis, were selected by IPA analysis among the differen￾tially expressed genes in the progressive group and are listed in
Table 3. Real-time PCR confirmed the over expression of ADM,
Plunc, SPP1, and the down regulation of RTKN2 (rhotekin 2) in a
subset of samples (n = 4) used for SAGE library construction
representing the progressive group. The values obtained for the
relatively stable group (n = 4) was arbitrarily set to one in order to
calculate a fold difference (Figure 3B). Both ADM and SPP1
have been previously shown to be up regulated in IPF confirming
our results [13,21,22]. To examine the cellular distribution of
Plunc, we analyzed IPF and normal lung tissue by immunohis￾tochemistry. Plunc was found to be mainly expressed in the
secretory/goblet type of bronchial columnar cells. In regions of
honeycombing there are bronchial/bronchiolar epithelia (includ￾ing the secretory type) that are strongly staining. It appears that
Plunc is also secreted into the mucus that is filling these cystic
spaces (Figure 3C). No Plunc expression was detected in normal
lung tissue (Figure 3D).
A molecular signature for disease progression in IPF
To determine if the identified 191 differentially expressed genes
associated with rapid progression in IPF (102 up and 89 down
regulated) represent a molecular signature, we selected for genes
with a P-value,0.05, and analyzed the significance of the
difference in mean expression level in both groups and determined
that the expression level of 134 of the 191 genes was sufficient to
correctly distinguish the progressive from the relatively stable
group (Student T-test P-values between 6.5E-3 and 2.4E-5). This
expression signature was tested by an unsupervised hierarchical
clustering of all IPF lung SAGE libraries used in this study showing
a clear distinction between the progressive and relatively stable
groups (Figure 4A). Interestingly, a study by Selman and
colleagues described an accelerated and slowly progressive variant
of IPF [13]. The sample size in the Selman microarray based study
is small but offers an opportunity to test our 134-signature in an
independent cohort. We found 90 genes (67%) in common with
our 134 expression signature that were represented on the custom
Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays [13]. Cluster analysis using
those 90 genes was insufficient to clearly distinguish the
accelerated variant from the slow variant (Figure 4B). Analysis
of the significance of the difference in mean expression level
between the accelerated and slow variant group among the 90
genes tested, demonstrated that only 58 out of the 90 genes were
significant (Student T-test P-value of 8.0E-3). This prompted us to
repeat the hierarchical clustering using a smaller set of genes and
the results show an improved separation of both groups
(Figure 4C). It is possible that when using the full progressive
IPF signature of 134, the clustering will be even more definitive for
the accelerated and slow variant. The clustering ‘behavior’ of the
dataset might simply reflect the differences in definition of the
accelerated and slow variant between Selman’s study and our
study. The main distinction being that the slow variant group in
Selman’s study included subjects with more than 24 months of
symptoms while in our study we selected subjects based on their
PFT values within a 12 months period following the initial biopsy.
Though the preliminary results are promising, the small sample
size does not support any formal conclusions regarding the
classification strength of the proposed 134-expression signature.
Pathway analysis of the IPF transcriptome and biomarker
selection
Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) was applied to select for the
main canonical pathways represented in the 1,121 transcript list of
over expressed genes in the IPF SAGE Transcriptome, using a
Fisher’s exact test with a P-value threshold of 0.05. These
pathways are the IGF-1 signaling, the ERK/MAPK signaling, the
protein ubiquitination, the PI13/AKT signaling, the cardiac
Disease Progression in IPF

b-adrenergic signaling, the actin-cytoskeleton signaling, the
integrin signaling, and the NRF2-mediated oxidative stress
response pathway (Figure 2C). Some of the canonical pathways
identified in this study have been previously implicated in IPF
[23,24]. Biomarker analysis using the IPA software identified 33
candidate biomarkers in the 293-IPF SAGE transcript signature.
Expression of these genes has been detected in various bodily fluids
like blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, plasma/serum, sputum,
and lung tissue in various diseases (Table S4). Two genes located
in the extracellular space have been detected in sputum as well as
in other bodily fluids; complement factor H (CFH) and
metallopeptidase inhibitor 1 (TIMP1). CFH is secreted into the
bloodstream and has an essential role in the regulation of
complement activation, and it acts as an adrenomedullin binding
protein [25]. The metallopeptidase inhibitor 1 has been previously
detected in interstitial macrophages in human IPF samples [26]
and is a key player in the fibrogenic response to bleomycin in
C57BL/6 mice [27,28]. The proteins encoded by the TIMP gene
family are natural inhibitors of the matrix metalloproteinases
(MMPs), a group of peptidases involved in degradation of the
extracellular matrix. Though it is unmistakable that MMPs play
an important role in IPF pathogenesis the exact mechanism how
TIMP1 is activated is still unresolved [29]. Recently it has been
shown that the over expression of TIMP1 was an independent
prognostic marker in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma
[30].
Gene Ontology, Pathway and Network analysis of
significant differentially expressed genes among patients
with progressive IPF
The identified differentially expressed genes in the progressive
group offer insight to the possible pathways and cellular processes
that might be involved in IPF progression. For a systematic and
unbiased analysis we used the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
program to explore the list of differentially expressed genes.
Figure 5A depicts the top canonical pathways that are
significantly associated with our dataset and are highly represented
in either the up regulated or down regulated list of genes. The
significance is determined by a high ratio (or percentage of genes
in pathway found in the gene list) and by a high negative logarithm
of the P-value; indicating that the pathway is significantly
associated with the data and that a large portion of the
corresponding canonical pathway may be affected.
The most prominent pathways in the progressive group (up
regulated list of genes) are integrin signaling, regulation of actin￾Figure 3. Differentially expressed genes in the lung parenchyma from the relatively stable and progressive IPF. (A) Selection criteria

calculate a fold difference. The fold difference in the progressive group is indicated by solid bars and the levels in the relatively stable group are

based mobility (cell migration), glycosaminoglycan (mucopolysac￾charides) degradation, (LXR/VDR) retinoic X receptor (RXR)
activation and chemokine signaling; suggesting an important role
for integrin signaling, immune function, bone metabolism and
vitamin D3/RXR activation in disease progression. The glycos￾aminoglycan degradation pathway is a process that seems to be
significantly associated with increased disease progression
(Figure 5). Glycosaminoglycans (mucopolysaccharides) are car￾bohydrate molecules or complexes of protein and carbohydrate
that form the ground substance of connective tissue. One of these
carbohydrates is hyaluronic acid. All substances passing to and
from cells must pass through the ground substance. Variations in
its composition and viscosity may therefore have an important
influence on the exchange of materials between tissue cells and the
blood. Another finding is the association of the nuclear RXR
(retinoic X receptor)/VDR (vitamin D receptor) activation
pathway with disease progression. The nuclear RXR can regulate
transcription by forming complexes with other nuclear factors and
can be activated by retinoid acid. This pathway has until now been
unexplored in pulmonary fibrosis, however it is important to note
that VDR-deficient mice failed to develop experimental allergic
asthma, suggesting an important role for the vitamin D endocrine
system in the generation of Th2-driven inflammation in the lung
[31].
Another clear distinction can be seen between the two groups of
patients with IPF when analyzing the percentage of genes
associated with various molecular and cellular functions
(Figure 5B). During disease progression, an increase is detected
in genes associated with cellular growth and proliferation, cellular
compromise (stress), cell signaling, cell morphology, cell death, cell
cycle and cell movement; molecular functions usually associated
with cancer. These results were confirmed by performing a
Network analysis. This analysis identified five partially overlapping
networks (Table 4) in our list of differentially expressed genes,
highlighting similar molecular functions associated with the
corresponding networks. The overlap between Network 1 and 3
is depicted in Figure 6 in which the central role for genes like p38
MAPK, NFkB, HSP70, EGR1, CCL2 and Ras homolog can be
easily detected.
Discussion
Our results indicate that molecular signatures of gene
expression appear to be useful in the identification of the presence
and predictive of the activity of IPF. We have shown that
molecular signatures can distinguish IPF from both normal lung
and other chronic lung diseases. Moreover, our findings suggest
that molecular signatures from lung parenchyma at the time of
diagnosis appear to be helpful in predicting disease progression
and may prove valuable in predicting the activity of IPF.
Genome-wide analyses of gene expression have facilitated the
identification of gene expression patterns or signatures revealing
the complexity of human cancer. Most of the work using large
scale gene expression data has been focused on discovering gene
expression profiles that can lead to a better understanding of
tumor development and proliferation. The strength of gene
expression analysis has been shown by the ability to identify new
cancer subtypes and predict clinical outcome [32]. A prognostic
gene expression signature has been proposed for survival in early￾stage lung cancer [33] and was recently validated in a large,
training-testing, multi-site, blinded study [34]. Gene expression
profiling has also allowed the prediction of breast cancer
recurrence [35] which has ultimately lead to the development of
the Mammaprint, a clinical test based on a 70-genes signature that
predicts the risk of metastasis in breast cancer patients [36].
While gene expression profiling has proven to be a powerful tool
for the identification of specific gene patterns and pathways
associated with certain types of human cancers, our findings
suggest that these molecular signatures may also prove useful in
understanding complex lung diseases, like IPF. The increase of the
protein ubiquitination pathway could be associated with an
increase of apoptosis of epithelial cells but has not been extensively
studied in IPF. There are few studies implicating the PI3/AKT
signaling pathway in IPF. Bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis
studies in mice have shown activation not only of TGF-beta but
also phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B via
a Semaphorin (SEMA) 7A-dependent mechanisms, and PKB/
AKT inhibition diminished TGF-beta-induced fibrosis [37].
SEMA 7A was not found to be differentially expressed in our
dataset though many family members and its receptor intergrin
beta are involved in the transcriptional profile of IPF. It has been
shown that collagen accumulation can be reduced by the
administration of PI3K inhibitors [38], implying that the PI3K/
AKT pathway might play an important role in pulmonary fibrosis.
Deregulation of the PI3K/PTEN/AKT pathway is one of the
most common altered pathways in human malignancy. Significant
advances have been made in the understanding of the AKT
signaling pathway in oncogenesis and in the development of small
molecule inhibitors. Whether this pathway could be targeted in
human pulmonary fibrosis remains to be established and could
offer new treatment opportunities. The integrin signaling pathway
is anticipated to be associated with pulmonary fibrosis since
integrins are the primary extracellular matrix (ECM) receptors
mediating ECM remodeling [39]. In response to changes in the
ECM, integrin signaling also regulates many other interrelated
cellular processes like proliferation, survival, cell migration and
invasion. However, further studies in larger cohorts, using either,
real-time PCR, a customized SAGE signature array or tissue￾array, are needed to validate the importance and relevance of
these findings for early diagnosis and disease management.
Our results may have a significant impact in the development of
early biomarkers for IPF. Identifying biomarkers that could reduce
the time to diagnosis may create a window of opportunity for
therapeutic intervention, especially in a disease like IPF where the
diagnosis is often delayed. While our transcriptional signature for

Disease Progression in IPF

disease progression was developed using lung biopsy samples, 47 of
the 134 gene products that were associated with clinical
progression have been detected in body fluids in various diseases
(such as blood, plasma/serum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or
sputum) according to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software.
Although for many of these 47 genes the biological function and
role in IPF pathogenesis is unknown, these genes and gene
products could potentially serve as biomarkers for this disease.
Genes like ADM (adrenomedullin), CCL2 (chemokine ligand 2),
PTPRF (protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor F) and SPP1
(osteopontin) play a role in the migration of smooth muscle cells
and cell proliferation and/or invasion implying a potentially more
important role of these processes in disease progression. The
chemokine CCL2 have been previously detected in metaplastic
epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells of IPF cases and it was
proposed that CCL2 may play a key role in the irreversible
progression of IPF [40]. In addition, a decrease of lung fibrosis was
detected in CCL2 null mice when exposed to bleomycin [41,42].

What’s more, CCL2 has been shown to be elevated in human
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with IPF [42,43]. The
protein was measured in plasma as well and it was shown that there
was no significant difference between IPF patients and normal
controls [44]. Our results indicate that CCL2 is a potential marker of
disease progression in IPF. Whether the plasma levels of CCL2
correlates with disease progression remains unknown [44]. Interest￾ingly, SPP1 have been localized to the alveolar epithelial cells in IPF
lungs, was also significantly elevated in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
from IPF patients [21] and, has been detected in plasma from
patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia [45]. Previous studies
have shown that SPP1 null mice clearly develop less fibrosis when
exposed to bleomycin. It was suggested that SPP1 is secreted by the
epithelial cells and has a profibrotic effect [21].
Some of these potential biomarkers genes have been implicated
in human cancers. Heat shock 70KDa protein 1A (HSPA1A) is up
regulated in brain, lung, and liver cancer. Macropain (PSMA7) is
increased in brain, breast, and stomach cancer, and plays an

important role in colorectal cancer progression providing a unique
target for drug development. The Ras homolog gene family
member B (RHOB), a Rho GTPase, is up regulated in brain and
breast cancer though down regulated in lung neoplasms. These
GTPases are crucial regulators of the actin cytoskeleton and also
play an important role in membrane trafficking. Associated with
lung cancer are FK506 binding protein 2 (FKBP2) and Plunc
(palate, lung and nasal epithelium carcinoma associated). The
latter gene belongs to the PLUNC family of proteins postulated to
play a role in innate immune response and is uniquely expressed in
the upper respiratory tract. Studies in cystic fibrosis have shown a
significant elevation of Plunc expression in diseased airways
[46,47]. As Plunc can be detected in sputum [48] and
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, it appears to be an ideal candidate
biomarker for disease progression in IPF. SAGE and microarray
analysis have recently indicated that Plunc is a novel marker that
distinguishes gastric hepatoid adenocarcinoma from primary
hepatocellular carcinoma [49].
The extensive SAGE IPF transcriptome presented in this
investigation demonstrates the complexity and scope of the
biological activity involved in IPF. Some of the pathways identified
by SAGE profiling have not been previously associated with IPF.
Network and pathway analyses have also shown that various
signaling pathways can interact or even partially overlap with each
other, thereby suggesting that IPF may be the result of multiple,
consecutive (or interactive) biological events, possibly triggered
by environmental stimuli. However, despite this biological
complexity, our findings clearly illustrate that molecular signatures
of gene expression in IPF may prove helpful in predicting disease
progression among those with IPF. Molecular and cellular
functions like cell proliferation, migration, invasion and cell
morphology appear to be over represented in the more progressive
IPF group; a striking similarity with human cancers. The
association with disease progression and the identifiable heteroge￾neity seen within samples emphasize the importance and the need
for an extensive molecular classification of IPF and other forms of
interstitial lung disease. The recognition that IPF may have
different subtypes that can be distinguished by their molecular
patterns could identify novel therapeutic targets and personalize
the clinical approach to this complex group of diseases.
Materials and Methods
Study Population
Lung tissue was obtained from patients with IPF who had a
definitive diagnosis based on UIP pathology from a surgical lung
biopsy [1,2]. Flash frozen surgical lung biopsy specimens, were
obtained from 12 patients with IPF who were undergoing initial
diagnostic evaluation and were not being treated for their IPF.
The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board
from National Jewish Health and written informed consent was
obtained where required. Further processing of the frozen samples
was performed at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This
research activity was approved by the Office of Human Subjects

Research at the NIH. The 12 specimens were specifically obtained
from two groups of patients; progressive IPF or relatively stable
IPF. In the progressive group (n = 6), the percent predicted forced
vital capacity (FVC) and the percent predicted diffusing capacity of
carbon monoxide (DLCO) declined significantly up to 12 months
following biopsy (respectively $10% and $15% ). The relatively
stable group (n = 6) had a relatively uneventful eventless course
over the 12 months following surgical lung biopsy with a decline in
percent predicted FVC,10% or a decline in percent predicted
DLCO,15%. No patient in either group received treatment for
IPF prior to lung biopsy.
RNA isolation and SAGE library construction
Total RNA was extracted from frozen lung tissue using the
RNAgents total RNA isolation system (Promega, Madison, WI,
USA). The quality of total RNA was analyzed using the RNA
6000 Nano Labchip kit on a 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, California). On average 1 to 5 mg of
total RNA as determined by the Ribo-Green RNA Quantification
kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) was used to construct
SAGE libraries from 12 IPF samples using Nla III as the anchoring
enzyme and BsmF I as the tagging enzyme according to a micro￾SAGE protocol [50]. The SAGE library clones were arrayed and
inserts were purified and sequenced at Agencourt Bioscience
Corporation. The SAGE 2000 software version 4.5 (available at
http://www.sagenet.org) was used to extract SAGE tags from the
original sequence files, remove duplicate ditags, remove linker
sequences, remove one base pair variations of linker sequences and
tabulate the occurrence of each tag. Tag sequences, tag counts and
gene associations were stored in a Microsoft Access relational
database for subsequent analysis. The complete SAGE IPF dataset
have been deposited in the GEO database (GSE11665). Other
SAGE profiles used in this study were downloaded from the GEO
(http://ncbi/geo/) or the SAGE Genie [51] website and are
depicted in Table S1. P-values for differentially expressed
transcripts were calculated according to the sequence odds ratio
and significant test (http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/SAGE). Similar
results were obtained when using the SAGE software Monte
Carlo approach or the significant test available as part of the
DiscoverySpace application [52].
Hierarchical Clustering
The open source clustering software Cluster 3.0 was used for
gene expression data analysis. Cluster 3.0 is an enhanced version
of Cluster [53] built for the Microsoft Windows platform. The
Cluster program is based on a modified Pearson correlation, and
was applied to the normalized SAGE data. Starting with a dataset
of 149,291 unique transcript tags, a second filter selecting for a
project total (sum expression level all 22 libraries included in this
study) of $10 counts was applied reducing the amount of
transcript tags to 23, 649. This SAGE dataset was then filtered for
at least five observations across the 22 libraries, with an absolute
value $2 and a maximum minus minimum value $2. These
settings produced a data set of 11,467 transcript tags. This data set
was subsequently adjusted by performing median centering and
normalization. This procedure resulted in a median-polished (i.e.
all row and column-wise median values are close to zero) and
normal (i.e. all row and column magnitudes are close to 1.0)
dataset. Next, the dataset was analyzed by applying a correlation
centered complete linkage clustering, which assembles the dataset
into a tree. Items joined by short branches are very similar,
whereas longer branches represent decreasing similarities. Results
were displayed with the TreeView program [53]. For confirmation
of the results and subsequent clustering of small datasets or
microarray data, the MultiExperiment Viewer (Version 4.1,
January 18th, 2008) was used [54] as well as a modified version
specific for SAGE data analysis [55].
Real-time PCR
Equal amounts of total RNA (5 mg) were used in a 20 ml cDNA
synthesis reaction primed with oligo-dT (Superscript II; Invitro￾gen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Control reactions were prepared in
parallel without reverse transcriptase. Prior to cDNA synthesis,
residual genomic DNA was removed from total RNA with a
DNase I treatment (DNA-free; Ambion, Austin, TX, USA).
Quantitative PCR was performed with a 7900TH Fast Real-Time
PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using
SYBR-Green. PCR reactions were performed in triplicate, and the
threshold cycle numbers were averaged. Gene expression levels
were normalized to ACTB (actin, beta), and PGK1 (phospho￾glycerate kinase 1). The relative expression levels were calculated
in comparison to the levels in total RNA from normal lung
(Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the Comparative Ct method in
which the relative expression equals 2-DDCt. PCR primers were
designed using the Primer 3 interface (http://www.bioinformatics.
nl/cgi-bin/primer3plus/primer3plus.cgi).
Immunohistochemistry
Five micron sections of paraffin-embedded tissue were depar￾affinized using 5 minute incubations in Xylene followed by 100%
and 95% ethanol. Slides were rinsed in distilled water and then
incubated for 30 minutes in a 3% aqueous solution of hydrogen
peroxide at room temperature. Slides were rinsed in distilled water
and then transferred to a Citrate buffer at pH 6.0 for antigen
retrieval in a pressure cooker at 125uC for 5 minutes followed by a
gradual cooling back to room temperature. Slides were rinsed in
distilled water, and then washed for 5 minutes in Tris-buffered
saline with 0.1% Tween (TBS-T). Washed slides were incubated in
Serum-free protein blocking buffer (DAKO, Carpenteria, CA) for
30 minutes. Blocking buffer was removed without washing and
100 ul of biotinylated primary antibody (#BAF1897, 1:50 dilution
in TBS-T, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was applied to each
slide. Slides were incubated in primary antibody solution overnight
at 4uC. Slides were washed for 5 minutes in TBS-T. Biotin-labeled
antibody detection was carried out using the Vectastain RTU
ARB reagent (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) following the
manufactures instructions. Staining was visualized with a 5 minute
room temperature incubation using DAB chromagen/buffer
(DAKO, Capenteria, CA). The color reaction was stopped in
distilled water and slides were counterstained for 3 minutes in
hemotoxylin, dehydrated in graduated ethanol’s and cleared using
Xylene prior to cover slipping. All slides were scanned using the
Aperio ScanScope XT (Aperio, Vista, CA).
Gene Ontology, Biomarker selection and Functional
Network Analysis
Data were analyzed through the use of Ingenuity Pathways
Analysis (Ingenuity SystemsH, www.ingenuity.com). Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis (IPA) is a web-based application that enables
the visualization, discovery and analysis of molecular interaction
networks within gene expression profiles. All generated gene lists
and corresponding expression levels, represented as the log2 ratios,
were uploaded within the IPA database for further analysis. Both
gene symbols and gene bank accession numbers were used with no
apparent differences in results. These genes, called focus genes,
were overlaid onto a global molecular network developed from
information contained in the Ingenuity knowledge base. The IPA
Disease Progression in IPF

knowledge base represents a proprietary ontology of over 600,000
classes of biologic objects spanning genes, proteins, cells and cell
components, anatomy, molecular and cellular processes, and small
molecules. Networks of the focus genes were then algorithmically
generated based on their connectivity. The Functional Analysis
of a network identified the biological functions and/or diseases
that were most significant to the genes in the network. The
network genes associated with biological functions and/or diseases
in the Ingenuity knowledge base were considered for the analysis.
Fischer’s exact test was used to calculate a P-value determining the
probability that each biological function and/or disease assigned
to that network is due to chance alone. Canonical Pathways
Analysis identified the pathways from the Ingenuity Pathways
Analysis library of canonical pathways that were most significant
to the dataset. The significance of the association between the
dataset and the canonical pathway was measured in 2 ways: 1) a
ratio of the number of genes from the dataset that map to the
pathway divided by the total number of molecules that exist in the
canonical pathway is displayed; 2) Fischer’s exact test was used to
calculate a P-value. Biomarker Analysis allows the identifica￾tion of the most relevant molecular biomarker candidates from a
dataset based on contextual information such as mechanistic
association with a disease or detection in bodily fluids.
