There is currently no consensus on the ideal body mass index (BMI) for kidney transplantation, yet an elevated 
BMI can limit access to transplantation. This study explored the attitudes of kidney transplant professionals 
regarding BMI as a selection criterion for kidney transplantation. Brief, in-person interviews were conducted at 
the 2016 American Transplant Congress. Participants were queried on their views regarding kidney transplant
eligibility for patients with classes 1, 2, and 3 obesity, as well as their transplant centers’ BMI-related policies. 
Most (88%) of the 94 participants did not consider class 1 obesity (BMI 30 to < 35) a contraindication to 
kidney transplantation, with a greater number of participants reluctant to consider patients with class 2 (BMI 35 
to < 40) or class 3 obesity (BMI ≥ 40) for transplantation. Participants’ suggested BMI limit was 2.3 points 
higher than that reported in transplant center policies. Overall, kidney transplant professionals viewed BMI a 
useful patient selection criterion when considered within the larger context of the patient’s clinical picture. Future 
research should assess outcomes for transplant recipients with varying obesity levels.
Introduction
Since the first successful kidney transplant was performed in 1954, there has been a persistent 
disparity in the supply of kidneys available for transplantation and the increasing demand.1,2
Today, there are nearly 95,000 individuals waiting for a kidney transplant, while just over 23,400 
kidney transplants were performed in the United States last year.1 This imbalance has forced the 
medical community to consider the ethical allocation of these scarce resources. The dilemma has 
primarily been addressed through the institution of patient selection or eligibility criteria policies 
and practices. Presently, in the United States, it is at the discretion of every kidney transplant 
center to define their own patient selection criteria for potential kidney transplant candidates, in 
the form of indications and contraindications to kidney transplantation. 
The rate of obesity in the United States has increased dramatically over the past several decades. 
Currently, over 40% of Americans have obesity, having a body mass index (BMI) greater than 
30 kg/m2
. 3 Another third of Americans have a BMI between 25 and 30, placing them at risk for 
becoming clinically obese as they age.4 Because of the rapidly increasing prevalence of obesity, 
BMI has emerged as a relevant factor when determining an individual’s eligibility for kidney 
transplantation. The average BMI of patients on dialysis has also been increasing exponentially

in the past several years.5,6 Twenty-four percent of kidney transplant candidates on the waiting 
list in the United States meet the criteria for class 1 obesity (defined as BMI of 30 to < 35 kg/m2
) 
and more than 14% meet the criteria for classes 2 or 3 obesity (defined as BMI of 35 to < 40 
kg/m2 and ≥ 40, respectively).
1,7
Some research suggests that patients with obesity have inferior clinical outcomes following 
kidney transplantation, including decreased patient survival,8 delayed graft function, 9–13 poor 
wound adhesion,
13–18 increased graft failure, 11,19 and an increased risk of diabetes and cardiac 
disease,20,21 compared to patients without obesity. Consequently, some patients with obesity are 
denied kidney transplantation due to a perceived increased risk of poor outcomes.22 Conversely, 
although some immediate postoperative outcomes are inferior, kidney transplant recipients with 
obesity have comparable long-term outcomes to those without obesity.14,18,23,24 Further, kidney 
transplantation in patients with obesity provides a survival benefit compared to long-term 
dialysis,6,14,16 with one study finding that the mortality rate for patients with obesity who 
underwent transplantation was half that of those remaining on the wait list.25
Kidney transplant professionals (i.e., nephrologists, surgeons, nurse coordinators, social 
workers, pharmacists) involved in the transplantation referral and patient selection processes are 
the gatekeepers to kidney transplantation. Their knowledge and interpretation of the current 
evidence related to outcomes for kidney transplant recipients with obesity thereby influences 
clinical decision-making, and ultimately, patient selection for kidney transplantation. Therefore, 
the primary purpose of this study was to explore the attitudes of kidney transplant professionals 
regarding BMI-related patient selection criteria for kidney transplantation. 
Materials and Methods
Setting and Participant Sample 
 
Trained members of the research team conducted brief (<10 minute) in-person, intercept 
interviews (i.e., the interviews were conducted onsite, spontaneously, without prior arrangement 
with the participants26) with a convenience sample of kidney transplant professionals attending 
the 2016 American Transplant Congress (ATC) in Boston, Massachusetts. The ATC is an annual 
meeting providing the most current information in the field of transplantation to physicians, 
surgeons, nurses, and other transplant professionals. In all, 277 (33.9%) kidney transplant 
professionals were approached at the conference entrance and verbally invited to participate by 
two trained research assistants on three consecutive days during the conference. Potential 
participants were screened for eligibility with a single question asking whether they worked in 
the field of kidney transplantation at the time of the interview (see Appendix for screening 
question and full interview guide). All eligible participants (N=94) provided verbal consent to 
be surveyed and audio-recorded for research purposes. The Temple University Institutional 
Review Board deemed the study exempt.

Measurement 
 
Eligible participants answered a series of 14 open- and closed-ended questions about obesity and 
kidney transplant eligibility, and weight-related policies for patient selection at their respective 
transplant centers. Specifically, participants were asked to provide their opinions about kidney 
transplantation for patients with class 1 or classes 2 or 3 obesity using two open-ended questions. 
Participants were then asked to indicate if patients with class 1 obesity or classes 2 or 3 obesity 
should be eligible to receive a kidney transplant, and a maximum BMI limit for which they would 
still consider a patient eligible for kidney transplantation. Finally, participants were asked about 
their knowledge of any policies regarding BMI and kidney transplant eligibility at their respective 
transplant centers, and whether participants agreed with those policies. All interviews were 
audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim by trained research assistants; a subset of 20 transcripts 
were reviewed for transcription accuracy. Demographic information on respondents’ role, 
gender, age, and race was also collected.
Data Analysis 
Transcripts of open-ended responses were uploaded to MAXQDA (Version 12; VERBI 
software), a qualitative data analysis software, for content analysis.27 Initial coding categories 
were derived deductively from the literature and the questions posed during the interview, with 
additional codes emerging inductively through review of participant responses.28 Intercoder 
reliability of at least 80 percent agreement was achieved before two trained research assistants 
independently assigned specific codes to capture the thematic content of the response. Further 
disagreements in coding application were resolved by discussion. Descriptive statistics were used 
to summarize each quantitative variable, with means and standard deviations for continuous 
variables and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. IBM SPSS Statistics for 
Windows (Version 24.0; Armonk, NY, USA) was used for all quantitative analyses.

Class I Obesity and Patient Eligibility for Kidney Transplantation
The majority of participants (88.0%) indicated that patients with class 1 obesity (i.e., BMI 
between 30 and < 35 kg/m2
) should be eligible to receive a kidney transplant (see Table 2). 
Coding of the open-ended responses to participants’ attitudes towards kidney transplantation 
for patients with obesity revealed ten themes (see Table 3). A majority of responses indicated 
that obesity alone is not a contraindication to kidney transplantation (57.0%); few responses 
cited obesity as an absolute contraindication to kidney transplantation (3.2%). Few participants 
also indicated that they would advise patients to pursue weight loss or bariatric surgery prior to 
kidney transplantation (5.4%). For example, one respondent remarked, “… I think those patients 
may benefit more from bariatric surgery referral and then we’ll consider if they don’t go or if they lose some 
weight…” [Participant 1002], and another noted, “They [patients] would be referred to get bariatric surgery 
and lower BMI so they can have better outcomes” [Participant 2027]. A minority of participants (15.0%) 
stated that kidney transplant eligibility based on BMI should be determined individually: “…it 
always depends on the patient, it always has to be – you have to always take a look at all the factors involved –
comorbidities, social support, psychosocial, all those issues before you make any decision about any patient...” 
[Participant 1003].

A few individuals suggested that BMI alone is a poor indicator of success with kidney 
transplantation (4.3%). For instance, one respondent commented, “A lot of these people tend to have 
higher weights and higher muscle mass and I think we are limiting our population of potential good candidates 
based on BMI,” [Participant 1007]. Similarly, another stated, “…you have to look at comorbidities and 
assess all the things you would do for any other transplant, you know, are they going to be able to get their 
medications, are they going to go to their follow up appointments, I don’t think that BMI alone should qualify –
or disqualify – initially…” [Participant 1027]. Participants also remarked on the benefits of 
transplantation afforded to patients compared to indefinite dialysis: “…their outcomes are better than 
dialysis so it should be offered with informed consent of some of the increased complication rates.” [Participant 
1032]. This was a common sentiment, even when challenges were acknowledged: “It’s a challenge 
because there’s a very high risk of wound infections in these patients and they just don’t tend to do as well as the 
rest, but… if you don’t transplant them, these patients have no other options.”

Classes II or III Obesity and Patient Eligibility for Kidney Transplantation 
 
When asked about transplant eligibility for patients with classes 2 or 3 obesity (BMI ≥ 35kg/m2
), 
far fewer participants were unreservedly willing to consider these patients as transplant 
candidates (33.7%), with just over half of the sample (56.5%) indicating that it would depend on 
other factors (see Tables 2 & 3). Twenty-two percent (22.2%) considered classes 2 or 3 obesity 
an absolute contraindication to kidney transplant. However, over a quarter of respondents 
(26.4%) indicated that the determination depends on the individual patient’s entire clinical and 
psychosocial presentation, not merely the patient’s BMI. One participant claimed, “I would say 
you have to take into account other factors because BMI itself doesn’t mean much, you have to look at them in 
person to make that decision” [Participant 1020]. Respondents (18.7%) also acknowledged that 
kidney transplant surgery among patients with more severe obesity can be technically challenging 
and has an increased risk of postoperative complications: “I think these people tend to have higher 
complication rates, more wound complications, DVTs, pulmonary complications… and they tend to have more 
comorbidities so I’m a little more cautious, but I do transplant them” [Participant 807]. For patients with 
severe obesity, 15% of the professionals surveyed advised weight loss or bariatric surgery prior 
to kidney transplantation.

Knowledge of and Agreement with Transplant Center BMI Policy 
 
The majority of participants (86.8%) were aware of a BMI-specific kidney transplant patient 
selection criteria policy at their respective transplant centers (see Table 4). Of the participants 
aware of a BMI-specific patient selection policy, most were in agreement with the BMI 
parameters stated in the current policy (87.3%) (see Table 4). However, transplant professionals 
suggested a mean maximum BMI limit for kidney transplantation that was 2.3 points higher than 
the mean maximum BMI limit detailed in the transplant centers’ policies. More specifically, the 
average maximum BMI for which participants would still consider patients for kidney 
transplantation was 38.6 ± 3.1 kg/m2 while the average maximum BMI stipulated recalled in 
transplant centers’ policies was 36.3 ± 3.1 kg/m2 (see Table 5). The highest suggested BMI was 
45.0, compared to a maximum BMI limit of 40.0 among the transplant center policies (see Table 
5).

Discussion
The findings of this study suggest that kidney transplant professionals have a nuanced 
understanding of the issue of obesity and kidney transplant eligibility. Participants in this study 
endorse assessment of the specific clinical and psychosocial circumstance of each individual 
patient, over a specific BMI cutoff, when making a determination for transplant eligibility. This 
is consistent with the official stance of the Renal Association, which concluded that obesity is 
not an absolute contraindication to transplantation, and recommends rigorous screening for 
cardiovascular disease, and individual assessments of transplant eligibility rather than a maximum 
BMI limit.29 Nevertheless, being classified as having obesity can impede attaining an active status 
on the kidney transplant waiting list and can significantly increase wait time. 30 In 2012, 1096 
(5.6%) of transplant candidates classified as inactive on the transplant waiting list after their 
initial listing were labeled as such secondary to their BMI. 31 Among transplant candidates with 
obesity who were categorized as inactive for weight-related reasons, just half ever achieved active 
status on the waiting list, and another 15% died before reaching active status. 22 Further, 
investigations of access to transplantation by weight found that as BMI increased, the likelihood 
of receiving a transplant decreased, and the risk of being bypassed once an available kidney was 
identified also increased.32
The American Society for Transplantation recommends that potential transplant candidates 
receive weight loss therapy to achieve a goal BMI < 30 kg/m2 prior to transplantation.33 Those 
individuals would be considered overweight rather than obese. This suggestion was cited by 
several study participants, who report advising patients with obesity, particularly patients with a 
BMI above 35, to engage in weight loss interventions, such as lifestyle modification (which 
typically includes caloric restriction, increased physical activity, and instruction in behavioral 
modification), pharmacotherapy, or bariatric surgery prior to accessing the transplant wait list. 
However, achieving sustained, significant weight loss while on dialysis can be difficult. Patients 
receiving dialysis, and following the dietary restrictions that accompany dialysis, may experience 
fatigue, declines in cognitive function, decreased muscle strength and endurance, as well as 
increased frailty.34–37 In comparison, more aggressive weight-reduction approaches such as 
bariatric surgery are effective at reducing BMI in transplant candidates.38 Transplant centers likely 
do not have the resources or expertise to provide weight loss interventions to their patients. 
While many medical centers and hospitals may have multidisciplinary weight loss programs that
offer the range of treatments, end stage renal disease likely makes active participation challenging 
for patients. Furthermore, weight loss treatment is not part of the universal insurance mandate 
at this time. While the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) began to provide 
coverage for medically supervised weight loss several years ago, only a limited number of 
physicians (primarily obesity medicine specialists) routinely offer this treatment to patients.39 
Finally, the modest weight losses of 5-7% of initial body weight typically seen with non-surgical 
weight loss treatment have not been shown to improve transplant outcomes.30,31 Thus, the 
appropriateness of mandating weight loss for patients to qualify for transplantation may not be 
scientifically justified at this time. 
CMS, which helps to oversee transplantation in the U.S., mandates that kidney transplant centers 
have patient selection criteria policies that identify indications and contraindications to kidney 

Urbanski et al. Kidney Transplant and BMI

transplantation.40 Transplant centers are expected to adhere to their patient selection policies; 
however, any diversion from the policy can be documented with an acceptable justification.40 In 
our study, participants self-selected a mean maximum BMI limit for kidney transplant recipients 
that was 2.3 points higher than the mean maximum BMI limit reported in their respective 
transplant centers’ policies. This finding suggests that transplant professionals are more willing 
to accept patients with higher BMIs and may be able to advocate within their programs for 
access to transplantation for a wider range of patients. This warrants further consideration, as it 
remains unclear if the inherent flexibility of patient selection criteria policies is well-known. 
Dialysis centers often use the transplant eligibility policies from local transplant centers to guide 
their transplant referral process for dialysis patients. Patients with higher BMIs may be 
discouraged from entering the transplantation evaluation process, and subsequently will not 
receive the medically managed weight loss support that may allow them to meet the kidney 
transplant eligibility criteria of their respective transplant centers. Some researchers have also 
suggested that a bias against considering high-risk candidates for kidney transplantation may 
exist among providers who may opt for a more conservative patient selection approach to 
accommodate regulatory agencies and payer sources.32 
This study’s findings should be interpreted in the context of its limitations. Namely, the 
convenience sample of kidney transplant professionals that attended the 2016 ATC is subject to 
selection bias, thus limiting the generalizability of the findings. In addition, information regarding 
the geographic location of participants or their respective transplant centers was not collected. 
Finally, participants’ may not have accurately recalled their transplant program’s BMI limits; 
patient selection policies were not collected for verification. Future studies should obtain these 
data points and utilize random sampling methods to increase the generalizability of their results. 
However, these findings serve as a critical initial step for understanding kidney transplant 
professionals’ perceptions about patients with obesity and their kidney transplant eligibility. 
Moreover, future studies should include an analysis of kidney transplant centers’ patient selection 
criteria policies to identify common practices and conduct an in-depth examination of outcomes 
among kidney transplant recipients with obesity.
The persistence of the supply and demand disparity in kidney transplantation ensures that patient 
selection criteria will remain in use for the foreseeable future. Therefore, it is essential to critically 
examine the policies and practices utilized in patient selection by transplant professionals and 
transplant centers, to ensure that these scarce resources are allocated in an unbiased and just 
manner, based on existing clinical evidence.
