Abstract
Objective
Evidence-based characterization of the diagnostic and prognostic value of the hematologi￾cal and immunological markers related to the epidemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019
(COVID-19) is critical to understand the clinical course of the infection and to assess in
development and validation of biomarkers.
Methods
Based on systematic search in Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Science Direct up to
April 22, 2020, a total of 52 eligible articles with 6,320 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19
cohorts were included. Pairwise comparison between severe versus mild disease, Intensive
Care Unit (ICU) versus general ward admission and expired versus survivors were per￾formed for 36 laboratory parameters. The pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) and
95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the DerSimonian Laird method/random
effects model and converted to the Odds ratio (OR). The decision tree algorithm was
employed to identify the key risk factor(s) attributed to severe COVID-19 disease.
Results
Cohorts with elevated levels of white blood cells (WBCs) (OR = 1.75), neutrophil count (OR
= 2.62), D-dimer (OR = 3.97), prolonged prothrombin time (PT) (OR = 1.82), fibrinogen (OR

= 3.14), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (OR = 1.60), procalcitonin (OR = 4.76), IL-6 (OR =
2.10), and IL-10 (OR = 4.93) had higher odds of progression to severe phenotype. Decision
tree model (sensitivity = 100%, specificity = 81%) showed the high performance of neutro￾phil count at a cut-off value of more than 3.74x109
/L for identifying patients at high risk of
severe COVID-19. Likewise, ICU admission was associated with higher levels of WBCs
(OR = 5.21), neutrophils (OR = 6.25), D-dimer (OR = 4.19), and prolonged PT (OR = 2.18).
Patients with high IL-6 (OR = 13.87), CRP (OR = 7.09), D-dimer (OR = 6.36), and neutro￾phils (OR = 6.25) had the highest likelihood of mortality.
Conclusions
Several hematological and immunological markers, in particular neutrophilic count, could be
helpful to be included within the routine panel for COVID-19 infection evaluation to ensure
risk stratification and effective management.
Introduction
Coronavirus disease– 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease that was detected in December 2019 in
Wuhan, China, and led to the risk of mortality of about 2% [1]. This disease is caused due to
infection with a recently arising zoonotic virus known as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syn￾drome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [2]. Previously, infection with coronaviruses appeared in
2002 within China in the form of SARS-CoV, and it appeared later also in 2012 within Saudi
Arabia that was known as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) [3, 4]. All these
coronaviruses are enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses that are isolated from bats that can
be transferred from animals to humans, human to human, and animals to animals [5]. They
share a similarity in the clinical symptoms in addition to specific differences that have been
recently observed [5–7]. The symptoms of this disease appear with different degrees that start
in the first seven days with mild symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, and
fatigue [8]. Afterward, critical symptoms may develop in some patients involving dyspnea and
pneumonia that require patient’s management in intensive care units to avoid the serious
respiratory complications that may lead to death [9]. However, there are no specific symptoms
to diagnose coronavirus infection, and accurate testing depends on the detection of the viral
genome using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis [10].
Unfortunately, COVID-19 is not limited to its country of origin, but it has spread all over
the world. Therefore, there is no wonder emerging research has been directed to provide infor￾mation and clinical data of patients infected with this virus that may help to not only to the
early detection in different patient categories, but it will also help in the characterization of the
viral complications with other chronic diseases [1, 2, 6, 9]. However, there is no sufficient data
that characterize the changes in the hematological and immunological parameters in COVID￾19 patients. In the current comprehensive meta-analysis study, we aimed to analyze different
hematological, inflammatory, and immunological markers in COVID-19 patients at different
clinical stages in different countries that may help in the early detection of COVID-19 infec￾tion and to discriminate between severity status of the disease to decrease the death risk.

Materials and methods
Search strategy
This current meta-analysis was carried out according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Sys￾tematic reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement [11] (S1 Table). Relevant literature
was retrieved from Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Science Direct search engines up to
April 22, 2020. Our search strategy included the following terms: “Novel coronavirus 2019”,
“2019 nCoV”, “COVID-19”, “Wuhan coronavirus,” “Wuhan pneumonia,” or “SARS-CoV-2”.
Besides, we manually screened out the relevant potential article in the references selected. The
above process was performed independently by three participants.
Study selection
No time or language restriction was applied. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Types of
Studies: retrospective, prospective, observational, descriptive or case control studies reporting
laboratory features of COVID-19 patients; (2) Subjects: diagnosed patients with COVID-19
(3) Exposure intervention: COVID-19 patients diagnosed with Real Time-Polymerase Chain
Reaction, radiological imaging, or both; with hematological testing included: complete blood
picture (white blood cells, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, monocyte count, eosinophils
count, basophils, red blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count), coagulation
profile (prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, activated partial thromboplastin
time, thrombin time, fibrinogen, and D-dimer) or immunological parameters including
inflammatory markers (ferritin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, procalcitonin, and C-reactive
protein), immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, and IgM), complement tests (C3 and C4), interleukins
(IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-2R, and TNF-α), and immune cells (B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes,
CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells); and (4) Outcome indicator: the mean and standard deviation
or median and interquartile range for each laboratory test. The following exclusion criteria
were considered: (1) Case reports, reviews, editorial materials, conference abstracts, summa￾ries of discussions, (2) Insufficient reported data information; or (3) In vitro or in vivo studies.
Data abstraction
Four investigators separately conducted literature screening, data extraction, and literature
quality evaluation, and any differences were resolved through another two reviewers. Informa￾tion extracted from eligible articles in a predesigned form in excel, including the last name of
the first author, date and year of publication, journal name, study design, country of the popu￾lation, sample size, mean age, sex, and quality assessment.
Quality assessment
A modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) was adopted to evaluate the process
in terms of queue selection, comparability of queues, and evaluation of results [12, 13]. The
quality of the included studies was assessed independently by three reviewers, and disagree￾ments were resolved by the process described above. Higher NOS scores showed a higher liter￾ature quality. NOS scores of at least six were considered high-quality literature.
Statistical analysis
All data analysis was performed using OpenMeta[Analyst] [14] and comprehensive meta-anal￾ysis software version 3.0 [15]. First, a single-arm meta-analysis for laboratory tests was per￾formed. The standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95%confidence intervals (CI) were
used to estimate pooled results from studies. Medians and interquartile range were converted

to mean and standard deviation (SD) using the following formulas: [Mean = (Q1+median
+Q3)/3] and [SD = IQR/1.35], whereas, values reported in the articles as mean and 95%CI
were estimated using the following formula [SD = pN � (Upper limit of CI–Lower limit of
CI)/3.92]. A continuous random-effect model was applied using the DerSimonian-Laird
(inverse variance) method [16, 17].
Next, in the presence of individual patient data, single-armed observed values were con￾verted to two-armed data to act as each other’s control group based on covariate information.
Only studies investigating different outcomes were considered as potential matched pairs, and
two-arm meta-analysis was applied to compare between mild versus severe COVID-19 infec￾tion (based on the results of the chest radiography, clinical examination, and symptoms), ICU
admission versus general ward admission, and expired versus survivors. Meta-analysis for each
outcome was processed using a random-effects model since heterogeneity among studies was
expected. For pairwise comparison, estimates of SMD served as quantitative measures of the
strength of evidence, which were then converted to the odds ratio (OR) with 95%CI for better
interpretation by clinical domains.
Decision tree to identify predictors for poor outcomes
Using laboratory features for clinical prediction, the decision tree algorithm was employed to
identify the key risk factors attributed to severe COVID-19 infection, which include a count of
studies �10. The accuracy of the model was measured by the Area Under the Receiver Operat￾ing Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC), which depicts the true positive rate versus the false
positive rate at various discrimination thresholds. The markers that have the highest AUC
were identified, and the sensitivity and specificity of the cut-off threshold level were deter￾mined. R Studio was employed using the following packages: tidyverse, magrittr, rpart, caret,
and pROC.
Trial sequential analysis (TSA)
The statistical trustworthiness of this meta-analysis assessment was conducted using TSA
through combining the cumulative sample sizes of all appropriate records with the threshold
of statistical impact to diminish the accidental errors and enhance the intensity of expectations
[18]. Two side trials with “type I error (α)” along with power set at 5% and 80% were
employed. In the case of the “Z-curve” traverses the TSA monitoring boundaries, a reasonable
degree of impact was accomplished, and no supplementary trials are crucial. Nevertheless, in
case of the “Z-curve” failed to achieve the boundary limits, the estimated information size has
not accomplished the required threshold to attract appropriate decisions and advance trials
are mandatory. TSA platform (version 0.9.5.10 beta) was operated in the experiment.
Assessment of heterogeneity and publication bias
After that, the heterogeneity was evaluated using Cochran’s Q statistic and quantified by using
I
2 statistics, which represents an estimation of the total variation across studies beyond chance.
Articles were considered to have significant heterogeneity between studies when the p-value
less than 0.1 or I
2 greater than 50%. Subgroup analysis was performed based on the study sam￾ple size (�50 patients compared to >50 patients) and the origin of patients (Wuhan city versus
others). Also, sensitivity analyses and meta-regression with the random-effects model using
restricted maximum likelihood algorithm were conducted to explore potential sources of
heterogeneity.
Finally, publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot and quantified using Begg’s and
Mazumdar rank correlation with continuity correction and Egger’s linear regression tests.

Asymmetry of the collected studies’ distribution by visual inspection or P-value < 0.1 indi￾cated obvious publication bias [19]. The Duval and Tweedie’s trim and fill method’s assump￾tion were considered to reduce the bias in pooled estimates [20].
Results
Literature search
A flowchart outlining the systematic review search results is described in Fig 1A. A total of
4752 records were identified through four major electronic databases till April 22, 2020 includ￾ing Web of Science (n = 557), PubMed (n = 1688), Scopus (n = 1105) and Science Direct
(n = 1402). Upon reviewing the retrieved articles, a total of 1230 records were excluded for
duplication, and 3522 unique records were initially identified. Following screening of titles
and abstracts, several studies were excluded for being case reports (n = 44), review articles
(n = 262), irrelevant publications (n = 1355), or editorial materials (n = 1809). The resulted
424 full-text publications were further assessed for eligibility, during which 372 records were
removed for lacking sufficient laboratory data. Ultimately, a total of 52 eligible articles were
included for the quantitative synthesis of this meta-analysis study, with 52 records represented
single-arm analysis [1, 9, 21–70], 16 records represented two-arms severity analysis [24, 26, 32,
34, 37, 40, 41, 45, 46, 50, 51, 63, 64, 66, 69, 70]; meanwhile, 7 and 4 records were utilized for
survival [9, 30, 53, 55, 61, 67, 68] and ICU admission [1, 31, 36, 52] analyses, respectively.
Characteristics of the included studies. Our review included 52 studies that were pub￾lished from January 24 through April 22, 2020, including 48 articles from China [Wuhan (30),
Chongqing (4), Zhejiang (4), Shanghai (2), Ningbo (1), Hong Kong (1), Shenzhen (1), Anhui
(1), Macau (1), Hainan (1), Jiangsu (1), and Beijing (1)], two articles from Singapore [Singa￾pore and Sengkang], one article from Taiwan [Taichung], and one article from USA [Wash￾ington] (Fig 1B). The main characteristics of eligible studies are shown in Table 1. A total of
6320 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled across the articles. Most records
(n = 47) were retrospective case studies, while other study design included two prospective
cohort studies, one observational cohort study, one descriptive case series, and one case-con￾trol study. Our team stratified 36 different laboratory parameters into seven subclasses, includ￾ing complete blood picture, coagulation profile, immunological markers, immunoglobulins,
complement tests, interleukins, and immune cells, as previously described in the methodology.
Regarding quality score assessment, 39 studies achieved a score higher than six out of a maxi￾mum of nine (high quality), while the remaining 13 studies earned a score equal or lower than
six (low quality), as shown in Table 1.
Pooled estimates of laboratory parameters: Single-arm meta-analysis
The final pooled estimates of single-arm meta-analysis included 52 eligible articles. The pooled
mean of laboratory parameters and 95%CI among SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, including
hematological, immunological, and inflammatory variables, is illustrated in Table 2. Our
results depicted a wide variability between studies for each laboratory marker. Apart from
immunoglobulins, IL-2R, and IL-8, significant heterogeneity was observed. Subgroup analysis
by sample size and city of origin and sensitivity analysis failed to reveal the source of variation
for each parameter. Additionally, meta-regression also rendered insignificant results.

Pooled estimates of laboratory parameters according to disease severity:
Pairwise meta-analysis
Two-arms meta-analyses were then conducted for three pairwise comparisons; (1) Severe ver￾sus mild COVID, (2) ICU admitted patients versus the general ward, and (3) Expired versus
survivors (Table 3).
Laboratory parameters of 16 eligible records were utilized to compare between severe and
non-severe patients. Severe cohorts were more likely to have high blood levels of white blood
cells (OR = 1.75, 95%CI = 1.21–2.54, p = 0.002), neutrophil count (OR = 2.62, 95%CI = 1.72–
3.97, p <0.001), prothrombin time (OR = 1.82, 95%CI = 1.00–3.33, p = 0.047), D-dimer
(OR = 3.97, 95%CI = 2.62–6.02, p <0.001), fibrinogen (OR = 3.14, 95%CI = 1.64–6.00, p
<0.001), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (OR = 1.60, 95%CI = 1.16–2.22, p <0.001), procalcito￾nin (OR = 4.76, 95%CI = 2.48–9.14, p <0.001), IL-6 (OR = 2.10, 95%CI = 1.02–4.32,
p = 0.043), and IL-10 (OR = 4.93, 95%CI = 2.18–11.1, p <0.001). In contrast, patients with nor￾mal lymphocyte count (OR = 0.30, 95%CI = 0.19–0.47, p <0.001), platelet count (OR = 0.56,
95%CI = 0.42–0.74, p <0.001), CD4+ T cells (OR = 0.04, 95%CI = 0.02–0.07, p <0.001), and
CD8+ T cells (OR = 0.03, 95%CI = 0.01–0.09, p <0.001) were less likely to develop severe form
of COVID-19 disease (Table 3A).
Significant heterogeneity was observed in eight of these parameters, namely WBC (I2 =
62.9%, p <0.001), neutrophil count (I2 = 67.6%, p <0.001), lymphocyte count (I2 = 77.4%, p
<0.001), prothrombin time (I2 = 72%, p = 0.003), D-dimers (I2 = 55.6%, p = 0.021), procalcito￾nin (I2 = 86.1%, p <0.001), IL-6 (I2 = 84.4%, p <0.001), and IL-10 (I2 = 82.8%, p = 0.003).
Pooled estimates of laboratory parameters according to ICU admission:
Pairwise meta-analysis
A total of 4 eligible articles were recognized to include laboratory features of ICU and floor
patients. Our data revealed having elevated levels of WBCs (OR = 5.21, 95%CI = 3.0–9.05, p
<0.001), neutrophils (OR = 6.25, 95%CI = 2.05–19.0, p = 0.001), D-dimer (OR = 4.19, 95%
CI = 1.88–9.35, p <0.001), and prolonged prothrombin time (OR = 2.18, 95%CI = 1.19–3.99,
p = 0.012) were associated with increased odds of ICU admission, while normal lymphocyte
count (OR = 0.23, 95%CI = 0.09–0.62, p = 0.003) and hemoglobin (OR = 0.14, 95%CI = 0.03–
0.64, p = 0.012) conferred lower risk of ICU admission (Table 3B).
Remarkable heterogeneity was obvious in studies of neutrophil count (I2 = 93.1%, p
<0.001), lymphocyte count (I2 = 68.5%, p = 0.023), and hemoglobin (I2 = 66.3%, p = 0.08).

These parameters were enclosed in two to four studies; therefore, further tracing for the source
of heterogeneity was not applicable.
Pooled estimates of laboratory parameters according to mortality: Pairwise
meta-analysis
Of the included articles, 7 studies contained separate results for laboratory testing in survival
versus expired patients. As depicted in Table 3C, our data revealed increased odds of having
elevated levels of WBC (OR = 5.21, 95%CI = 3.0–9.05, p <0.001), neutrophils (OR = 6.25, 95%
CI = 2.05–19.0, p = 0.001), prothrombin time (OR = 3.19, 95%CI = 1.58–6.47, p = 0.001), D￾dimer (OR = 6.36, 95%CI = 4.72–8.58, p <0.001), ferritin (OR = 5.50, 95%CI = 1.6–18.8,
p = 0.006), ESR (OR = 1.82, 95%CI = 1.16–2.86, p = 0.008), procalcitonin (OR = 5.70, 95%
CI = 2.18–14.9, p <0.001), CRP (OR = 7.09, 95%CI = 3.23–15.5, p <0.001), and IL-6
(OR = 13.87, 95%CI = 7.6–25.4, p <0.001) in expired cases. However, patients with normal
lymphocyte count (0.21 (0.10, 0.47, p <0.001), platelet count (0.43 (0.28, 0.68, p <0.001),
CD4+ T cells (OR = 0.30 (0.16, 0.55, p <0.001), and CD8+ T cells (OR = 0.22 (0.15, 0.34, p
<0.001) had higher chance of survival (Table 3C).
Considerable heterogeneity was also noted in some of these parameters, namely WBC (I2 =
78.0%, p <0.001), neutrophilic count (I2 = 90.9%, p <0.001), lymphocyte count (I2 = 89.3%, p
<0.001), platelet count (I2 = 59.5%, p = 0.030), ferritin (I2 = 91.6%, p <0.001), procalcitonin
(I2 = 81.5%, p = 0.005), CRP (I2 = 87.3%, p <0.001), and IL-6 (I2 = 75.4%, p = 0.007). Given the
small number of enrolled studies with discriminated data on patients who survived or died, we
failed to identify the source of heterogeneity.
Subgroup and sensitivity analysis
For the studies which included a comparison between mild and severe patients, subgroup and
sensitivity analyses were performed for five laboratory markers (WBC, neutrophil count, lym￾phocyte count, procalcitonin, and CRP). First, to identify how each study affects the overall
estimate of the rest of the studies, we performed leave-one-out sensitivity analyses. Results did
not contribute to give explanations to heterogeneity. In contrast, subgroup analysis revealed
homogeneity with certain categorizations. For WBCs lab results, heterogeneity was resolved
on stratification by the origin of study population [Wuhan population: I
2 = 73.4%, p = 0.002,
other cities: I
2 = 0%, p = 0.53] and month of publication [April: I
2 = 74.5%, p = 0.001,

results resolved in articles with large sample size >50 patients (I2 = 46.2%, p = 0.06). Moreover,
the degree of dissimilarities of procalcitonin results found in different studies was ameliorated
in April publications (I2 = 41.5%, p = 0.16) and in those with low sample size (I2 = 0%,
p = 0.80). Similarly, homogeneity was generated in CRP results in articles with low sample size
(I2 = 0%, p = 0.58) (Table 4).

Meta-regression analysis
Considering the number of the included studies with severity, ICU admission, and mortality
data was rather small, we performed meta-regression analyses for only five parameters (men￾tioned above) in studies comparing mild and severe disease (Table 4).
For WBCs, higher difference between mild and severe cohorts was noted in Wuhan studies
than other population (coefficient = 0.31, 95%CI = 0.03, 0.58, p = 0.029). Moreover, articles
with larger sample size exhibited a wider variation of neutrophilic count between severe and
non-severe cases (coefficient = 0.60, 95%CI = 0.20, 1.01, p = 0.003). For the same marker, later
studies published in April also showed higher difference compared to those published in Feb￾ruary and March (coefficient = 0.31, 95%CI = 0.06, 0.55, p = 0.014). In contrast, more reduc￾tion of lymphocytes was observed in April articles than earlier ones (coefficient = -0.57, 95%CI
= -0.97, -0.17, p = 0.006).
Publication bias
Publication bias was performed to the same five parameters with study count �10 (S1 Fig).
Visual inspection of the funnel plots suggested symmetrical distribution for all laboratory
parameters tested. The Egger test (p > 0.1) confirmed that there was no substantial evidence of
publication bias; Egger’s regression p values were 0.44, 0.50, 0.68, 0.56, and 0.22 for WBC, neu￾trophil count, lymphocyte count, procalcitonin, and CRP, respectively.
Decision tree and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve
To identify predictors for severity, decision tree analysis was applied using multiple laboratory
results. High performance of classification was found with the usage of a single parameter;
neutrophilic count identified severe patients with 100% sensitivity and 81% specificity at a cut￾off value of >3.74 identified by the specified decision tree model. Further analysis of the area
under the curve of input data is shown in Table 5.
Trial sequential analysis
As elaborated by the decision tree algorithm for the role of neutrophilic count on decision￾making to discriminate between COVID-19 patients with a mild and severe presentation, TSA
was employed on that particular laboratory parameter to test for the presence of sufficient
studies from which results were drawn. The sample size of studies containing neutrophilic

accounted for a total of 1,558 subjects. TSA illustrated crossing of the monitoring boundary by
the cumulative Z-curve before reaching the required sample size, suggesting that the cumula￾tive proof was acceptable, and no additional future studies are needed to authenticate the sig￾nificances (Fig 2).
Discussion
During the last few months, the prevalence of COVID-19 infection was increased daily among
different countries overall in the world. Thus, the need to assess the disease severity and mor￾tality are required to limit the pervasiveness of this pandemic [71]. A diverse of abnormal labo￾ratory parameters including hematological, inflammatory as well as immunological markers
thought to be raised throughout COVID-19 outbreak [2, 72]. In this comprehensive meta￾analysis, our team attempted to interpret the distinct questions raised about the various spec￾trum of laboratory parameters associated with the severity and mortality of COVID-19. At the
beginning of this workflow, our team investigated different hematological, inflammatory, and
immunological variables of 6320 patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Our findings using ran￾dom-effect models revealed increased levels of WBCs and neutrophil counts that were signifi￾cantly associated with higher odds ratio among severe, ICU admission and Expired patients
with COVID-19. On the contrary, the levels of lymphocyte and platelet counts were lowered
among severe and expired patients with COVID-19. Also, we observed depletion in quantities
of CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells among severe and mortality patients.
Nevertheless, in patients with the COVID-19 outbreak, the WBC count can vary [73].
Other reports indicated that leukopenia, leukocytosis, and lymphopenia have been reported,
although lymphopenia appears most common [74, 75]. Another study supported that lympho￾penia is an effective and reliable indicator of the severity and hospitalization in COVID-19
Fig 2. Trial sequential analysis. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) for the neutrophil count. The acquired sample size of the neutrophil
count was 1558 subjects and the cumulative Z-curve crossed the monitoring boundary before reaching the required sample size
(n = 540), suggesting that the cumulative proof was reliable, and no additional trials are required to achieve the significance.

patients [76]. The additional report suggested that COVID-19 illness might be implicated with
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells depletion through acting on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes
[34]. A recent meta-analysis study discovered that the severity among COVID-19 patients
might correlate with higher levels of WBCs count and lower levels of lymphocyte, CD4+ T
cells, and CD8+ T cells counts [72]. In this respect, we could speculate that the depletion in the
number of lymphocytes count is directly proportional with the severity of COVID-19 infection
and the high survival rate of the disease is associated with the ability to renovate lymphocyte
cells, particularly T lymphocytes which are crucial for destroying the infected viral particles
[77]. During disease severity, remarkable thrombocytopenia was observed and confirmed by
Lippi and his colleagues that revealed a reduction of platelet count among severe and died
patients with COVID-19 supporting that thrombocytopenia could consider as an exacerbating
indicator during the progression of the disease [78]. Therefore, our findings could support Shi
et al. conclusion that high WBC count with lymphopenia could be considered as a differential
diagnostic criterion for COVID-19 [79].
Considering coagulation profile, our team observed a prolonged in most coagulation mark￾ers among severe, ICU and expired patients, especially prothrombin time, fibrinogen, D￾dimer, but with normal proportions of activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) that
could focus the light on the pathogenesis of COVID-19 infection through interfering with
extrinsic coagulation pathway. A recently published report concluded similar findings in the
form of observation of higher levels prothrombin time, D-dimer along fibrin degradation
products among non-survival compared with survival patients [80].
Numerous studies illustrated the pathogenesis action of COVID-19 with the induction of
cytokine storm throughout the progressive phase of the infection [72, 81, 82]. The generation
of cytokine storm within COVID-19 patients required increased levels of IFN-γ and IL-1β that
could stimulate the cellular response of T helper type 1 (Th1) which has a crucial function in
the acceleration of specific immunity against COVID-19 outbreak [81]. Due to the elevated
levels of IL-2R and IL-6 accompanied by the advancement of COVID-19, several cytokines
secreted by T helper type 2 (Th2) cells that could neutralize the inflammatory responses
including IL-4 and IL-10 [72, 81]. Our findings revealed a significantly associated with elevated
levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines involving IL-6 and IL-10 among severe and expired
patients with COVID-19. A recent study indicated a similar assumption with these findings
and identified elevated levels of IL-6 and IL-10 among non-survived compared with survived
patients [9]. Another confirmation of this conclusion is confirmed by a newly published meta￾analysis report that indicated an exaggerated elevation of IL-6 and IL-10 throughout the severe
level of COVID-19 infection [72].
Concerning the inflammatory markers associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, this com￾prehensive meta-analysis study observed higher concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP)
and procalcitonin besides elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) levels among severe
and expired patients with COVID-19. Recently, Henry et al. established a meta-analysis survey
and corroborated this finding with a higher significance of CRP and procalcitonin levels [72].
Other recent reports identified higher levels of CRP among severe patients with COVID-19
infection [76]. An additional meta-analysis survey established based on four recent articles
indicated prolonged levels of procalcitonin among severe patients with COVID-19 [83]. In
this respect, we might speculate the potential role of procalcitonin as a prognostic biomarker
during the severe status of COVID-19. Finally, our team revealed increased levels of serum fer￾ritin among non-survived patients compared with survived patients, and this significant out￾come was observed in another meta-analysis study among severe and non-survival patients
with COVID-19 infection [72].

This comprehensive meta-analysis confronted several limitations that raised throughout
the processing of the outcomes. First, the insufficient laboratory data concerning the interest
of design causing the increasing bias among different covariates. Second, the variation in the
characteristics among different articles concerning the severity and survival of COVID-19.
Third, the small sample sizes of some studies besides most of the concerned articles were estab￾lished within China, especially Wuhan. Finally, there was an observed publication bias and
heterogeneity in this comprehensive meta-analysis.
Conclusion
In conclusion, several laboratory parameters could associate with the severity and mortality of
COVID-19 infection and should be screened and measured continuously during the progres￾sion of this pandemic. These parameters included WBCs count, lymphocytes, platelet count,
prothrombin time, D-dimer, and fibrinogen. Also, various interleukins could serve as anti￾inflammatory markers such as IL-6, and IL-10 and should be evaluated. The estimation of
other inflammatory biomarkers like CRP and procalcitonin could be helpful in the monitor
the severity of the disease.
