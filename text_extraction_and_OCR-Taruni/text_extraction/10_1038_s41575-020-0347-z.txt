Liver transplantation (LT) programmes worldwide 
have been deeply affected by coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respira￾tory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Solid 
organ transplantation activity has decreased even in 
regions where COVID-19 prevalence was low, which 
suggests a global and nationwide effect beyond the local 
COVID-19 prevalence (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Given the speed of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, no 
scientific evidence regarding LT is available to guide 
medical policymakers during this period of readjust￾ment. Yet, given the potential negative consequences, 
multiple organizations have released recommendations 
stating that all potential organs from deceased donors 
with SARS-CoV-2 infection should be deferred, includ￾ing those from otherwise medically eligible donors with 
mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most 
programmes recommend screening deceased donors 
to prevent the inadvertent transplantation of organs 
from a SARS-CoV-2-infected donor1
. However, owing 
to a scarcity of deceased donor organs and high risk 
of waitlist mortality, some advocate the utilization of 
COVID-19-positive liver donors in selected cases. 
The rationale is the low (albeit not null) proportion of 
viraemic cases and no recognized SARS-CoV-2 trans￾fusion transmissions, as well as the absence of evidence 
of SARS-CoV-2 infection in liver in the very limited 
number of autopsy studies2
.
Notably, although the potential for SARS-CoV-2 
transmission by non-lung organ donation is unclear, 
a case of COVID-19-associated hepatitis in the recip￾ient of a living donor liver allograft, whose donor 
subsequently tested positive for COVID-19, has been 
described (Supplementary Table 1). Furthermore, the 
potential negative consequences of COVID-19-positive 
donations not only to the recipients but also to the 
transplant team, organ procurement organization and 
associated hospital workforce community, particularly 
in the absence of effective therapy, argues against this 
strategy. In this scenario, donor screening using both 
clinical and laboratory approaches remains an important 
consideration.
Most societies recommend a thorough epidemio￾logical and clinical history screening alongside donor 
testing for COVID-19 (nucleic acid testing (NAT) of 
nasopharyngeal specimens of donor and recipient) 
(Supplementary Box 1)1,3
. Donor testing should be 
executed preferentially by bronchoalveolar lavage in 
deceased donors or by nasopharyngeal swab in living 
donors1
. As no test is 100% sensitive or specific4
, risk 
stratification by epidemiological and clinical screening 
as recommended by the AST (see Related links) should 
be considered.
In countries with a high incidence of COVID-19, a 
positive epidemiological screening (that is, residence 
in or travel to a high-risk area, or contact with a sus￾pected or confirmed case) can be assumed positive. 
Positive clinical screening includes the onset of any 
of a set of symptoms 21 days before evaluation (Fig. 1; 
Supplementary Box 1). Donors who are positive for 
both the epidemiological and clinical screenings are 
considered high risk, while one or no positive screening 
denote intermediate or low risk, respectively. The organs 
of donors who test positive for COVID-19 by NAT or 
who are considered high risk without available NAT 
should not be used for transplantation. In the absence 
of available testing, only four professional societies con￾sider it acceptable that organs be procured according to 
epidemiological and clinical risk stratification1
 (Fig. 1; 
Supplementary Box 1).
Liver grafts recovered from COVID-19-positive 
deceased donors 21–28 days after symptom resolu￾tion and two negative swabs 24h apart are considered 
safe for transplantation. High-risk donors with clinical 
symptoms within 28 days before organ procurement 
should not be considered even if they test negative 
(Supplementary Box 1)3
.
For living donors, most societies recommend testing 
donors at least once within 24–72 days before trans￾plantation. Moreover, 14–21 days’ self or hospital-based 
quarantining has been recommended together with pre￾ventive transmission counselling. COVID-19-positive 
or high-risk living donors should postpone donation 
until at least 21–28 days after symptom resolution

The effect of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on liver transplantation programmes and 
recipients is still not completely understood but overall involves the risk of donor-derived 
transmission, the reliability of diagnostic tests, health-care resource utilization and the effect of 
immunosuppression. This Comment reviews the effect of COVID-19 on liver transplantation and 
summarizes recommendations for donor and recipient management.

and until two negative PCR tests have been observed 
(Supplementary Box 1)3
. The recipient should undergo 
a real-time PCR test within 24 h of transplantation. 
Recipients with clinical suspicion or active SARS-CoV-2 
infection should have transplantation deferred until 
28 days after symptom resolution and after two negative 
tests at least 24h apart1
.
The decision to pause a life-saving procedure such 
as LT becomes increasingly difficult as waitlist mortal￾ity increases. To optimize transplant activity and limit 
collateral damage, a system based on risk tolerance, 
hospital capacity and degree of virus activity in the 
jurisdiction has been proposed. This phased approach 
would mean that urgent transplantations would pro￾ceed first, while ‘elective’ cases could be phased in later 
based on Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) 
score, risk of drop-out (particularly from liver cancer 
progression) and fulminant hepatic failure3
. Living 
and deceased donor LTs would be performed pref￾erentially in clinically unstable patients according to 
intensive care unit capacities and facilities3
. Most pro￾fessional societies recommend the temporary cessa￾tion of elective living donor and non-urgent deceased 
donor liver transplantation during the pandemic1
(Supplementary Fig. 2).
Liver injury has been widely reported in COVID-19 
(ref.
5
), particularly in patients with severe disease. 
Pre-existing liver disease6
, comorbidities, drug toxicity 
or the complex systemic inflammatory response syn￾drome associated with the infection might also explain 
liver injury5
.
On the basis of data from other viruses, includ￾ing SARS-CoV, one would argue that immunosup￾pressed patients with COVID-19 are at increased risk 
of higher viral loads, severe clinical manifestations and 
prolonged shedding3
. Yet, preliminary data in LT sug￾gest that COVID-19 ranges from mild to severe, with 
similar or lower incidence than the general popula￾tion (Supplementary Table 1). Unfortunately, data on 
COVID-19 in solid organ transplantation, and particu￾larly in LT, are based on short and uncontrolled series 
with conflicting results. The incidence of COVID-19 
in a large Italian LT survey (n =640) was only 1.25%, 
and most patients (75%) had mild disease7
. Conversely, 
a report showed worse outcome in solid organ trans￾plantation recipients in New York City, USA8
. Long-term 
LT recipients seem to be more prone to severe disease 
than short-term LT patients, suggesting that immuno￾suppression per se does not increase the risk of severe 
COVID-19, and that alternatively, the presence of 
metabolic-related comorbidities typically observed in 
long-term recipients is responsible for the increased 
risk of severe COVID-19 in this population9
. Prolonged 
shedding is also relevant in terms of viral spreading 
and the need for long quarantine periods. Although no 
convincing data have been published, case reports have

Fig. 1 | Approach to liver transplantation during COVID-19. Epidemiological screening includes any of the following: 
travel or residence in a high-risk area, contact with a suspected case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)≤21 days 
before, or contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19≤28 days before. Clinical screening includes onset of any of the 
following symptoms 21 days before evaluation: fever>38°C; malaise or flu-like symptoms; new cough; shortness of breath; 
unexplained abdominal pain, nausea or diarrhoea; or loss of sense of taste or smell. *Liver transplantation (LT) decision 
should be made with caution and at least 28 days after presumptive diagnosis of COVID-19. Figure is based on the main 
international transplant societies’ recommendations (such as AST and AASLD). DCD, deceased donor; LD, living donor.

described positive PCR tests lasting up to 36 days from 
clinical onset (Supplementary Table 1).
According to the WHO, there is no specific treatment 
or vaccine for COVID-19. Therefore, treatment of LT 
recipients should be based on the principles of acute res￾piratory distress syndrome therapy. Although controver￾sial, data suggest that an altered immune response might 
be the main driver of pulmonary injury, thereby indicat￾ing a potential protective role of immunosuppression10. 
Society recommendations are based on the general 
approach to transplant recipients with active infection, 
whereby minimization of immunosuppression is typ￾ically beneficial and the trade-off between the benefit 
and risk of graft rejection must be considered. Overall, 
most societies advise against immunosuppression mod￾ifications in patients with mild COVID-19, whereas 
reduction or discontinuation of antiproliferative agents 
and lymphocyte-depleting therapies has been suggested 
in special circumstances such as severe lymphopenia, 
worsening pneumonia or bacterial or fungal superin￾fection (for example, by the AASLD; see Related links). 
Furthermore, experimental COVID-19 treatments 
might interact with immunosuppressive drugs, lead￾ing to an increased risk of graft rejection or toxicity. 
More data are needed on LT and COVID-19 to inform 
treatment decisions.
