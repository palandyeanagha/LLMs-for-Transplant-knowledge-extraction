We evaluated the prevalence of hepatitis E virus 
(HEV) in the pork production chain in Czech Republic, 
Italy, and Spain during 2010. A total of 337 fecal, liver, 
and meat samples from animals at slaughterhouses were 
tested for HEV by real-time quantitative PCR. Overall, HEV 
was higher in Italy (53%) and Spain (39%) than in Czech 
Republic (7.5%). HEV was detected most frequently in 
feces in Italy (41%) and Spain (39%) and in liver (5%) and 
meat (2.5%) in Czech Republic. Of 313 sausages sampled 
at processing and point of sale, HEV was detected only in 
Spain (6%). HEV sequencing confi rmed only g3 HEV strains. 
Indicator virus (porcine adenovirus) was ubiquitous in fecal 
samples and absent in liver samples and was detected in 
1 slaughterhouse meat sample. At point of sale, we found 
porcine adenovirus in sausages (1%–2%). The possible 
dissemination of HEV and other fecal viruses through pork 
production demands containment measures.
Human hepatitis E is endemic worldwide, particularly 
in Asia, where large waterborne outbreaks have been 
reported (1). Seroprevalence of hepatitis E virus (HEV) is 
>60% in rural southern People’s Republic of China (2) and 
4%–10% in western Europe (3) and the United States (4). 
In these areas, hepatitis E occurs mostly as sporadic cases 
(5–7), but epidemics also have been described (8). Most 
cases in Europe have been linked to genotype 1 (g1) virus 
and associated with travel to g1-endemic areas. However, 
autochthonous human infections are increasing in Europe 
and in other industrialized countries (5,6,9). Of the 4 
genotypes affecting humans, genotype 3 (g3) is the main 
HEV genotype also circulating among pigs in Europe (10) 
and human infections are observed sporadically worldwide 
(11,12).
Several reports indicate that HEV can be transmitted 
through zoonotic and foodborne pathways, including 
through consumption of raw and undercooked liver, meat, or 
sausages from domestic pigs, wild boar, and deer (8,13,14). 
Several investigations have shown that farmed domestic 
pigs are widely infected with and shed g3 HEV in Europe. 
Studies conducted in Spain (8,13,14), Italy (15), and France 
(16) have detected HEV genomic RNA in livers of pigs 
of slaughtering age, indicating that HEV-contaminated 
food might reach supermarkets (17). In butcher shops in 
the Netherlands (18) and Germany (19), ≈6.5% and ≈4%, 
respectively, of pork livers contained HEV, which raises 
concern about the potential for direct transmission through 
contact with or consumption of contaminated food.
Despite the large widespread distribution of HEV￾shedding pigs and the possible role of farmed pigs as the 
main virus reservoir, the number of human hepatitis E 
cases in Europe remains low, suggesting ineffi cient virus 
transmission or lower pathogenicity of swine g3 strains 
than of g1 strains for humans. Because g3 HEV is common 
in pigs but rare in humans, humans are postulated to not be 
a main host for g3 virus replication (11,20). Nonetheless, a 
possibly large underestimation of HEV spread in humans 
cannot be excluded because of asymptomatic cases, 
inadequate diagnostics, and scarce medical attention (21). 
Mansuy et al. suggested inadequacy of previous diagnostic 
methods and recently found unprecedentedly high HEV 
seroprevalence among blood donors in France (22).

HEV in Pork Production Chain
 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 18, No. 8, August 2012 1283
Relatively few studies of foodborne human hepatitis 
E are available (8,21,23), making evaluation of HEV￾associated risks diffi cult. Investigation of HEV throughout 
the pork production chain from farm to point of sale 
is needed to highlight areas of risk and proper control. 
A recent report from European Food Safety Authority 
biohazard experts (24) underscored an urgent need for 
integrated studies on HEV circulation, performing farm￾to-table integrated risk assessment. For other foodborne 
pathogens, such studies comprise quantitative microbial 
risk assessment on the basis of exposure and dose-response 
models (25). Unfortunately, for HEV, quantitative 
approaches are hardly accessible because of the absence of 
reliable cell culture systems for viral infectivity titration.
We aimed to assess HEV prevalence in the pork 
production chain from slaughterhouse to point of sale 
in Czech Republic, Italy, and Spain during 2010 in the 
framework of the FP7 VITAL (Integrated Monitoring and 
Control of Foodborne Viruses in European Food Supply 
Chains) project (www.eurovital.org/). This systematic 
multicountry investigation of domestic swine HEV was 
conducted by using standardized molecular approaches, 
including reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT￾qPCR) detection, process, and internal amplifi cation 
controls (IACs) and proper fecal viral indicators (porcine 
adenovirus [PAdV]).
Materials and Methods
Sampling Strategy
Samples were taken at perceived critical points for virus 
contamination. They were identifi ed from Hazard Analysis 
and Critical Control Point System audit principles-based 
questionnaires (K. Willems and R. Moloney, pers. comm.) 
completed in each premise and analyzed by VITAL 
food-safety management and risk assessment experts (M. 
Bouwknegt and A. De Roda Husman, pers. comm.).
Samples
A total of 113 fecal, 112 liver, and 112 meat (lingual 
muscle) samples from 113 healthy pigs (Sus scrofa subsp. 
domestica) were collected in slaughterhouses from Czech 
Republic, Italy, and Spain during 2010 (Table 1). Samples 
originated from 4 pig farms per country. Packaged sausages 
were sampled in processing sites and supermarkets in Italy 
and Spain (128 and 93 samples, respectively) and in 8 
supermarkets in Czech Republic (92 samples).
Additional ad hoc samples were collected during fact￾fi nding visits to production farms, processing plants, and 
points of sale (Table 2). Briefl y, 73 samples were collected 
from working surfaces and cutting tools (swabs from knife, 
belt surface, and meat mincer) from slaughtering areas (10 
samples), processing areas (19 samples), and points of sale 
(12 samples) and from workers’ hands (20 samples) and 
workers’ toilets (12 samples). In Czech Republic, 6 effl uent 
water samples from slaughterhouses also were examined.
Sample Process Control Virus
Murine norovirus 1 (MNV-1) was used as sample 
process control virus (SPCV). A single batch with MNV-1 
at the concentration of 4.7 × 107
 PFU/mL was prepared and 
used by all collaborating institutes throughout the study 
(26).
Virus Concentration and Nucleic Acid Isolation
Pig Feces
Feces (>1 g) were collected aseptically. A total of 250 
mg of sample in 15-mL centrifuge tubes were suspended in 
2.25 mL phosphate-buffered saline containing gentamycin 
(10 mg/mL), and 10 μL SPCV (4.7 × 105
) was added. 
Suspensions were vortexed for 60 s and centrifuged at 
3,000 × g for 15 min. Supernatants were immediately 
used for nucleic acid isolation or stored at –70°C. Nucleic 
acid was extracted by using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini 
Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Final elution was performed 
2× with 50 μL elution buffer, resulting in a 100-μL nucleic 
acid extract, for immediate testing or −70°C storage.
Pork Liver, Meat, and Sausages
Liver and meat or sausage samples were collected (1 
cm3
 from 3 different locations) and stored in sterile plastic 
bags. According to the method of Bouwknegt et al. (18), 
samples were fi nely chopped and homogenized in an RNase￾free mortar with 4 mL of Buffer RLT (RNeasy Midi Kit, 
QIAGEN) containing 1:100 β-mercaptoethanol. A total of 
250 mg homogenate was transferred into microcentrifuge 
tubes containing 1 mL RLT buffer, 2.5 g sterile 1-mm 
zirconia beads (BioSpec Products, Inc., Bartlesville, OK, 
USA), and 10 μL SPCV (4.7 × 105
). Tubes were applied to 
a mechanical disruptor (Ribolyser-Cell-Disrupter, Hybaid 
Ltd., Ashford, UK) for two 40-s/4-m/s cycles. After 
centrifugation (10,000 × g, 20 min, 2×), 800 μL of resulting 
supernatants were immediately processed by RNeasy Midi 
Kit or freeze-stored. Nucleic acid extracts (300 μL) were 
assayed immediately or freeze-stored.
Workers’ Hands and Surfaces
Workers’ hands and surfaces were sampled by using 
sterile moistened swabs, and samples were stored in 5 mL 
of 10 mg/mL gentamicin-containing phosphate-buffered 
saline in plastic tubes. Unwashed hands were sampled 
immediately before lunch or afternoon coffee break. 
For surfaces, 10-cm2
 areas were rubbed. Liquids were 
decanted from swab containers into 50-mL centrifuge

tubes containing 10 μL SPCV (4.7 × 105
). Suspensions 
were vortexed and centrifuged (3,000 × g, 5 min), and 
supernatants were used immediately or freeze-stored. 
Nucleic acids were extracted by NucliSENS miniMAG Kit 
(bioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France) and eluted 2× with 50 
μL elution buffer.
RT-qPCR
Nucleic acids were assayed undiluted and diluted 10-
fold by performing RT-qPCRs in duplicate. All reaction 
mixes included an IAC (27). All RT-qPCRs were in duplex 
format, targeting specifi c viruses (MNV-1, HEV, PAdV) 
and IACs labeled with FAM (6-carboxy fl uorescein) and 
VIC (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) probes, 
respectively. All tests included virus- and IAC-negative 
controls.
PAdV RT-qPCR
A duplex RT-qPCR was used as described (28), 
including IACs and a carryover contamination prevention 
system using uracil-N-glycosylase (Roche Molecular 
Diagnostics, Manheim, Germany). Reactions contained 1× 
TaqMan Universal PCR Master-Mix (Life Technologies, 
Branchburg, NJ, USA), 0.9 μM primers, 0.225 μM PAdV 
TaqMan probe (FAM-labeled), 50 nM IAC probe (VIC￾labeled), and 100 copies of PAdV IAC. Ten microliters 
of nucleic acid extract were added to 25-μL fi nal reaction 
volumes. Thermocycling conditions were 2 min at 50°C 
and 10 min at 95°C, followed by 45 cycles of 15 s at 95°C 
and 1 min at 60°C.
HEV RT-qPCR
A 1-step duplex RT-qPCR was used (29) and included 
IACs. Reactions contained 1× RNA UltraSense reaction 
mix (Life Technologies), 0.25 μM primers, 0.1 μM probe 
HEV-P (FAM-labeled), 50 nM IAC probe (VIC-labeled), 
1× ROX reference dye, 1 μL RNA UltraSense enzyme mix, 
and 300 HEV IAC copies. Ten microliters of nucleic acid 
extracts were added to 20 μL fi nal volumes. Thermocycling 
conditions were 15 min at 50°C and 2 min at 95°C, followed 
by 45 cycles of 10 s at 95°C, 20 s at 55°C, and 15 s at 72°C.
MNV-1 RT-qPCR
A 1-step duplex RT-qPCR was adopted (30), including 
IACs. Reaction contained 1× RNA UltraSense reaction 
mix, 0.2 μM primers, 0.2 μM probe minor groove binder–
open reading frame (ORF) 1/ORF2 (FAM-labeled), 50 
nM IAC probe (VIC-labeled), 1× ROX reference dye, 1 
μL RNA UltraSense enzyme mix, and 600 MNV-1 IAC 
copies. Ten microliters of nucleic acid extract were added

(fi nal reaction volume 20 μL). Thermocycling conditions 
were 15 min at 50°C and 2 min at 95°C, followed by 45 
cycles of 15 s at 95°C and 1 min at 60°C.
Data Reporting and Interpretation
For proper results interpretation, we considered 
4 signals: 1) target virus, 2) SPCV, 3) target IAC, and 
4) SPCV IAC (31). With cycle threshold (Ct
) <45, 
independently of corresponding IAC Ct
, the PCR result 
was considered positive. With Ct
>45 and corresponding 
IAC Ct
<45, results were interpreted as negative. When both 
targets and corresponding IACs showed Ct
>45, reactions 
were considered failed. When >1 replicate target assay 
(HEV or PAdV) was positive, the sample was considered 
positive. Absence of SPCV and its IAC signals indicated 
preamplifi cation processes (virus concentration and 
extraction) failure (31). In the presence of SPCV, SPCV 
IAC, and target IAC signals, target virus signal absence 
was conclusively indicating test negative result.
HEV Genotyping
Positive HEV samples were sequence-analyzed 
amplifying 2 ORF2 regions (348- and 121-bp fragments) 
(32,33). Sixteen sequences obtained were examined 
in GenBank (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank). The 5 
shorter 100-bp fragments (3 fecal samples in Italy and 
1 liver and meat sample in Czech Republic) were used 
only to identify genotype or confi rm longer sequences. 
The 11 longer sequences (300 bp) from 4 fecal samples 
in Italy (GenBank accession nos. JN861803, JN861804, 
JN861805, JN861806) and 7 sequences from 5 sausages and 
2 environmental swabs in Spain (GenBank accession nos. 
JN903913, JN903914, JN903915, JN903916, JN903917, 
JN903918, JN903919) also were used for HEV genotyping 
and subgenotyping. We performed phylogenetic analyses 
with Bionumerics v6 (Applied Maths, Kortrijk, Belgium) 
by using the neighbor-joining method with 1,000 replicates 
with Kimura-2 correction factor.
Results
HEV in Pork Products
We detected HEV RNA in all pork production chain 
sites in investigated countries, with some differences 
(Table 1). Overall, HEV RNA was detected in >1 samples 
(feces, liver, meat) from 36 (32%) of 113 pigs examined 
at slaughterhouses for which all sample types were 
collected (Table 1). HEV RNA was detected frequently in 
slaughterhouse samples in Italy and Spain, i.e., 18 (53%) 
positive samples from 34 animals and 15 (38%) of 39, 
respectively (Table 1), whereas in Czech Republic, HEV 
RNA prevalence at slaughterhouses was remarkably lower, 
i.e., 3 (8%) positive samples from 40 animals. Pig feces 
showed highest HEV RNA presence (27%), followed by 
liver (4%) and meat (3%) (Table 1).
Sausage samples from Italy and Spain were collected 
from processing plants of the same company slaughtering 
animals or from same company products in local 
supermarkets. Sausages sampled in Czech Republic were 
obtained from randomly chosen supermarkets. HEV was 
detected in 6 (6%) of 93 samples in Spain, whereas 0 of 220 
sausages in Czech Republic or Italy were positive.
PAdV in Pork Products
To evaluate possible fecal contamination, PAdV DNA 
presence (34) was determined for all samples assayed for 
HEV. PAdV was highly prevalent in feces (90%–98%) in 
investigated countries (Table 1). None of 112 liver samples 
were PAdV positive, and only 1 of 112 meat samples was 
PAdV positive, in Italy. In addition, 4 (1%) of 313 sausages 
(2 from Spain, 1 each from Czech Republic and Italy) were 
positive for PAdV (Table 1).
Environmental Samples
We collected 41 surface swabs from working surfaces, 
meat mincers, knives, and other working items at the 3 
pork production chain sites. Overall, swab samples were 
positive for either HEV (11 [27%] of 41) or PAdV (6 [15%] 
of 41) (Table 2). HEV-positive samples were found more 
frequently at slaughterhouse (6 of 10) than at processing and 
points of sale (4 [21%] of 19 and 1 [8%] of 12, respectively) 
sites, and PAdV was found only in slaughterhouse 
samples (6 of 10). At slaughterhouses, positive swabs (3 
knives, 2 fl oor, 1 belt surface) contained both HEV and 
PAdV, indicating potential fecal contamination during 
slaughtering steps, whereas 0 of 5 HEV-positive samples at 
processing and points of sale sites was positive for PAdV, 
disproving possible fecal cross-contamination during later 
production phases (Table 2). A total of 20 swab samples 
were taken from workers’ hands, gloves, or aprons along 
the production chain. Overall results were similar to those 
for working surfaces in slaughtering premises; in fact, 
5 (71%) of 7 samples were positive for both HEV and 
PAdV. Moreover, PAdV was detected in 1 of 2 HEV￾positive samples at processing sites (Table 2). Finally, 
HEV or PAdV was detected in 1 (8%) of 12 toilet swab 
samples collected at points of sale. The 6 Czech Republic 
slaughterhouse effl uent samples were negative for both 
PAdV and HEV.
Sequence Analysis
HEV-positive samples were genotyped and sequenced 
to determine possible animal or human origin of the 
virus. A total of 9 samples (4 from Italy, 5 from Spain) 
yielded ≈300-bp sequences and were compared with HEV 
sequences in public databases. All HEVs belonged to g3. 

RESEARCH
The 4 HEV-positive samples (HEVSwITFAE09BO10, 
HEVSwITFAE18BO10, HEVSwITFAE22BO10, HEVSw
ITFAE11BO10) in feces from slaughterhouses in Italy 
originated from the same herd and belonged to subtype 
g3c, sharing 99.4%–100% identical nucleotides. Three 
of 5 sequences from sausage in Spain belonged to 
subtype g3f (HEVSwESSAU56, HEVSwESSAU57, 
HEVSwESSAU60), whereas 2 additional g3 strains 
(HEVSwESSAU64, HEVSwESSAU66; 99.5% identity) 
could not be assigned to specifi c subtypes (online 
Appendix Figure, wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/18/8/11-
1783-FA1.htm), although their sequences were closer 
to subtype g3c. Two sequences from swabs collected in 
Spain (HEVSwESADHOC4A, HEVSwESADHOC5A) 
also belonged to g3f, showing 100% reciprocal nucleotide 
identity and 89% identity with g3f strains from sausages. 
Sequences for g3 subtypes from Italy and Spain exhibited 
<85% nucleotide identity, suggesting circulation of 
different strains in these countries.
Shorter sequences (121 bp, ORF2) also were obtained 
(33) from 3 fecal samples in Italy (100% identity), and 2 
additional identical sequences were obtained from liver 
and meat at a slaughterhouse in Czech Republic. All were 
confi rmed as g3 swine HEV, but further subtyping was not 
possible because of short sequence length.
Discussion
Pork is a major food source worldwide (10), and HEV 
is widespread among farmed swine and can be transmitted 
zoonotically, including through pork products (5,10). We 
investigated HEV presence throughout the pork production 
chain in 3 European countries from pigs entering 
slaughterhouses through processing to retail stores.
To optimize detection sensitivity, in our sampling 
strategy we assumed low HEV prevalence in pork 
products and environmental surfaces (17,35) and involved 
3 laboratories. In addition to liver, we selected sausage 
because it is handled by consumers and is a blend of 
different meat and slaughtered animals. To maintain 
consistent results among countries and sample treatment, 
we validated standardized sampling and molecular 
procedures by ring test (36), including IAC and sample 
process controls (26,27,31).
Samples analyzed throughout the pork production 
chain in Italy and Spain were from the same herds from 
farm to retail sale. In Czech Republic, more points of sale 
were sampled, thus representing a larger animal population. 
HEV prevalence in pig feces was similar in Italy and Spain 
(41% and 38%, respectively), refl ecting previous data in 
these and other European countries (10). Conversely, only 
3% of pigs from Czech Republic shed HEV. Because of 
shared protocols and controls, this difference cannot be 
attributed to different diagnostic sensitivity among partners, 
which otherwise detected HEV in similar numbers of liver 
and meat samples.
Lower HEV shedding by pigs in Czech Republic 
might refl ect different farming methods, such as animal 
housing and separation, herd size, slaughtering age, and/
or environmental factors that possibly infl uence infectious 
HEV persistence, spread, and transmission. Previous data 
from Czech Republic (37) showed up to 40.0% HEV￾positive bile samples from piglets, suggesting infection 
rates close to shedding rates reported for Italy and Spain. 
However, that study did not examine HEV fecal shedding, 
and pigs were only 2–3 months of age. Furthermore, varying 
prevalence of HEV in pig feces also has been reported in 
Italy and Spain (15,38), possibly refl ecting differences in 
farm selection.
The absence of fecal HEV in pigs with HEV￾positive liver or bile in Czech Republic suggests that bile 
concentration in the fecal mass was lower when samples 
were taken, as might be expected if pigs were fed long 
before reaching the slaughterhouse. This fi nding might 
also help explain the different fecal HEV positivity among 
countries.
We confi rm broad HEV circulation within pig farms 
and HEV RNA in livers and other pork products (8,17,18). 
We found HEV prevalence in 3%–6% of liver samples at 
slaughter, similar to fi ndings in the Netherlands (18) but 
somewhat less than in the United States (11%) (17). HEV 
RNA was present in meat samples only in Czech Republic 
and Italy (3% and 6%, respectively), whereas sausages were 
HEV positive only in Spain (6%). This fi nding might result 
from low sample numbers but also could refl ect different 
methods for fi nal product preparation by using different 
meat blends, fat, or liver intentionally or after unintentional 
cross-contamination.
HEV positivity markedly decreased from feces (27%) 
to liver (4%), meat (3%), and sausage (2%) but never 
disappeared during production. However, detection of 
HEV by RT-qPCR did not conclusively demonstrate viable 
virus and thus risks to consumers.
PAdV has been confi rmed as a suitable indicator of 
swine fecal contamination during pork production (28). 
Although most pig feces in our study were PAdV positive 
(90%–98%), PAdV was never detected in liver and detected 
only occasionally in pork meat (1/33 samples in Italy) or 
sausage (4/313 samples, all 3 countries). Comparing HEV 
and PAdV fi ndings, risks for cross-contamination of pork 
products with swine feces during preparation appear to be 
low but not absent.
Three of 112 pork meat samples tested were positive 
for HEV and 1 for only PAdV (Table 1). We have no proof 
of HEV replication in muscle, and fi nding HEV RNA in 
pork products probably refl ects endogenous HEV particles 
in infected liver and/or viremic blood (39). Although liver

and bile are usually removed before processing, the HEV 
genome sporadically detected in meat most likely represents 
cross-contamination of carcasses during slaughtering, 
which suggests a need for worker training.
PAdV detection in 1 meat sample and 4 sausages also 
indicates some fecal contamination during slaughtering, 
which was, however, similarly low in all countries. PAdV 
and HEV were not present in the same sausage samples 
from Spain, and PAdV was detected in fewer samples than 
was HEV (2 vs. 6), which argues against potential higher 
risks for fecal contamination in the food chain in Spain. 
The higher HEV prevalence in sausage in Spain than in 
Italy or Czech Republic is unclear and deserves further 
investigation.
The samples from food handlers and the environment 
in Italy and Spain also identifi ed areas where procedures 
and information could be implemented. Detection of 
HEV and PAdV in 60% of fl oor and working surfaces 
and 57%–71% of hands and aprons of workers dissecting 
pigs indicates that the initial production areas (bleeding to 
evisceration) are at higher risk for fecal contamination and 
highlight possible hazards to workers.
In the cutting/slicing/chopping areas, we did not detect 
PAdV in fecal samples. However, HEV detection on hands 
and surfaces indicates that endogenous HEV can be spread 
during cutting of liver and meat in industrial premises, 
requiring cross-contamination control measures. Limited 
handling might instead explain the single detection of HEV 
on a butcher’s bench at point of sale.
The HEV detected from a supermarket personnel toilet 
was not genotyped. Thus, its possible origin, i.e., pig versus 
human, cannot be confi rmed.
Our analysis of short sequences confi rms presence 
of only g3 HEV. Sixteen sequences from Italy and Spain 
were subtyped; g3c was identifi ed as the prevalent strain 
in Italy, and the less common g3f was noted only in Spain. 
Two identical HEV sequences in sausage from Spain might 
represent a novel g3 subtype, similar to a deer g3 HEV 
strain found in Spain in 2010 (40).
In conclusion, our study indicates that HEV is 
present throughout the pork production chain and that 
processing does not substantially abate endogenous virus. 
Consequently, consumers might purchase pork products 
that contain detectable HEV genome in up to 6.0% of 
instances, independent of source and country of origin, 
probably unrelated to fecal contamination during pork 
processing.
We cannot exclude the possibility that in some pork 
products HEV was infectious. However, HEV infectious 
dose for humans is unknown, and viral load in pork might 
not be suffi cient to infect humans effi ciently. Storage, 
processing, and blending of meat from HEV-positive 
and -negative animals (e.g., sausage) might substantially 
decrease risks for foodborne infection, possibly explaining 
why HEV food transmission in Europe seems relatively 
ineffi cient. However, consumers should eat only pork that 
has been thoroughly cooked, particularly liver, and avoid 
cross-contamination of surfaces and other food by handling 
pork products, especially offal.
This study addressed only fresh meat or sausage sold 
within few days of preparation. Future studies should be 
extended to other pork products, such as salami, which are 
eaten after short periods of curing and might still contain 
residual infectious virus.
