Abstract: Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are common medications, used in respiratory medicine for controlling conditions 
such as asthma and other obstructive airway diseases. The systemic effects of oral corticosteroids are well known and 
established; inhaled steroids have been known to cause relatively minor and localized adverse effects such as oral 
candidiasis. However, less attention has been paid to their systemic effects. Although currently there is a paucity of 
prospective studies demonstrating the systemic effects of inhaled corticosteroids, there are numerous retrospective studies 
adding evidence to this link. Inhaled corticosteroids can affect the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, bone density and 
growth, eyes, skin and immunity including an increased risk of pneumonia. Clinicians are recommended to aim for the 
lowest possible dose to avoid these systemic side effects. Fluticasone is more likely to cause systemic effects compared to 
budesonide. Newer ICS molecules such as ciclesonide may be more beneficial in reducing such systemic complications 
on prolonged use. This paper provides an updated overview of the common systemic effects encountered with ICS 
treatment.

INTRODUCTION
Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are frequently used to treat 
chronic respiratory conditions such as asthma and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). They are effective 
by reducing inflammation and airway hyper-responsiveness 
and therefore reduce the risk of exacerbations [1].
There are four main types of inhaled steroids that are 
widely available for treating patients, namely; beclometasone 
dipropionate, budesonide, fluticasone propionate and 
mometasone furoate. Relatively newer inhaled steroid 
molecules include ciclesonide and flunisolide.
Systemic effects can vary depending on the type of 
steroid and the dosage used. Other factors include pharmaco￾kinetics, type of inhaler and method of administration with 
inter-patient differences in susceptibility and response [2].
Although prolonged exposure to oral steroids has long 
been associated with systemic side effects that are well 
established, the systemic effects of inhaled preparations are 
less often considered. As ICS are recommended for the 
management of common respiratory conditions such as 
asthma and COPD, and inhaled steroids being step 2 on the 
asthma management ladder [3] it is imperative that their 
systemic complications are highlighted and reviewed 
regularly by the prescribing clinician.
There is a substantial amount of data suggesting that 
inhaled corticosteroids are effective at managing respiratory

conditions and thus will continue to remain the mainstay of 
treatment. However, clinicians must appreciate and 
recognize their widespread effects. The main objective of 
this article is to provide an overview of the systemic 
complications and effects that may occur in patients on long￾term ICS. It aims to provide the clinician with an 
understanding of these effects so as to aid clinical 
management and knowledge when dealing with such 
patients.
ICS may exert their effects and cause complications in 
the hypothalmo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, bones, skin, 
eyes, growth and immunity. This paper will also address 
effects of ICS use in pregnancy.
EFFECTS ON HYPOTHALAMO-PITUITARY￾ADRENAL (HPA) AXIS
ICS have been found to affect the hypothalamo-pituitary￾adrenal axis [4]. Exogenous corticosteroids act on the 
hypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland, and cause a 
negative feedback which attenuates the release of cortisol 
from the adrenal cortex [5]. This hypo-stimulation causes 
shrinkage of the adrenals due to disuse. This suppressive 
effect of corticosteroids is only problematic if the exogenous 
stimulus is removed suddenly (i.e. inhalers discontinued), or 
if a greater cortisol response is required during the 
introduction of stressful stimuli e.g. infection, surgery, or 
trauma. The lack of an adequate endogenous glucocorticoid
response (due to adrenal atrophy) would result in an adrenal 
insufficiency crisis.
Several studies have compared the effects of different 
ICS on the HPA axis and have assessed for a dose response

relationship. Low dose ICS (0.4 mg/day), regardless of the
device or drug, have not shown to cause adrenal suppression 
[6]. Contrasting results do exist however as these studies 
were conducted over a short period of only two weeks [7] 
and one of these was not blinded [8] leading to potential 
confounders.
With higher doses (>0.4 mg/day), Clark et al. showed 
fluticasone administered to asthmatic children via a large 
volume spacer caused adrenal suppression as measured by 
urinary cortisol. Budesonide however at the same dose did 
not have this effect [9]. In a similar test in asthmatic adults 
comparing fluticasone and budesonide administered via 
metered-dose inhalers, only 8.3% patients had low urinary 
cortisol levels with budesonide, whilst 58% of patients on 
fluticasone were seen to have low urinary cortisol levels 
[10].
On comparing high dose ICS given via the same device, 
fluticasone propionate and beclomethasone dipropionate 
have more of an effect on the HPA axis than budesonide [9, 
11]. Thus it can be concluded that fluticasone is more potent 
at inhibiting the HPA axis than budesonide and also this 
suppression is dose related.
In order to assess whether patients on ICS would be able 
to mount a response to stressful situations, stimulation with 
high dose exogenous corticotropin such as cosyntropin is 
required. Such studies have been conducted with long term 
beclomethasone dipropionate with no concomitant use of 
oral corticosteroids. Of the 11 patients on higher doses of 
ICS, 4 had low serum cortisol levels pre- and post￾cosyntropin test [12]. Thus ICS at higher doses upset the 
response required to stressful stimuli.
Todd carried out a survey to inquire whether ICS caused 
adrenal crisis in children and adults. Of the 28 children 
meeting the study criteria, 22 had an episode of acute 
hypoglycemic events where they presented with reduced 
conciousness, coma or convulsions. In one case, the child’s 
death was thought to be caused by adrenal insufficiency as 
demonstrated by adrenal hemorrhages and cushingoid 
features. In the study population (n=33), 30 subjects were 
found to have an impaired response to the short synacthen 
stimulation test. Moreover there were 37 episodes of adrenal 
crisis. The cause was found to be related to cessation or a 
reduction in the ICS dose [13]. This observation is consistent 
with the studies that prove ICS diminish the ability of the 
adrenals to mount a response to stress. 76% of adrenal crisis 
episodes in this survey were in patients on high dose ICS. In 
addition most of the episodes include the use of fluticasone 
despite it being the least prescribed ICS in the patient 
population [14, 15]. This is consistent with a meta-analysis 
showing that fluticasone was more effective in suppressing 
the adrenals vs budesonide [5, 15]. The higher lipophilic 
properties and longer half-life [16] of fluticasone may 
explain this difference. Fluticasone is able to distribute 
effectively due to its highly lipophilic nature, and its long 
half-life means it is able to exert its adrenal suppressive 
effects for an extended period [17]. This may also explain 
why fluticasone can be used to wean patients off oral 
corticosteroids i.e. high dose fluticasone has systemic effects 
comparable to that of oral corticosteroids [18].
With the abundance of data suggesting that ICS do affect 
the HPA axis, clinicians should regularly assess adrenal 
function particularly in patients on high doses of fluticasone 
[13]. Though budesonide may have a lesser effect on HPA, 
ciclesonide and flunisolide, which are newer ICS molecules, 
have been assessed for effects on the HPA, and have been 
found to possess reduced effects on the HPA [19, 20] and 
may be better treatment options in patients where this is of 
concern.
EFFECTS ON BONE
The link between systemic steroids and osteoporosis is 
well established. Glucocorticoids affect bone in a number of 
ways; they reduce the lifespan of osteoblasts and osteoclasts 
by inducing apoptosis as well as reducing recruitment of 
these cells from progenitor cells (thereby affecting bone 
formation and resorption). They also affect calcium 
absorption and excretion either by direct effects on the renal 
tubule or by affecting calcium binding in the intestines [21].
There is much controversy surrounding the effects of ICS 
on bone health. There are conflicting studies on the effects 
ICS have on bone density, and whether they increase fracture 
risk [22]. Some studies show that it is not the use of ICS that 
increase fracture risk, but rather the chronic respiratory 
disease process itself. This is demonstrated by Staa et al. 
[23]. Their study composed of three cohorts: patients on ICS, 
patients on non-corticosteroid bronchodilators and a control 
group. Those on systemic steroids were not included in the 
study. The relative rates of vertebral, non-vertebral and hip 
fractures were higher in the cohorts on ICS and those on 
non-corticosteroid bronchodilators compared to the control 
group. There was no difference however, between the ICS 
and non-corticosteroid cohort. This suggests that COPD 
patients are at a greater risk of developing osteoporosis and 
thus fractures independent of ICS use. The factors 
responsible for this may include hypercapnea, low BMI and 
the likelihood of COPD patients being heavier smokers [24]. 
Other studies such as the TORCH study also did not show an 
increase in fracture risk with the use of ICS [25].
Gonnelli compared the fracture risk of ICS compared 
with β2-agonists in COPD patients [26]. The parameters 
assessed were bone status of the calcaneus using ultrasound 
and vertebral fractures using radiography. This large study 
revealed that at higher doses (>1500 µg/day) of ICS is 
associated with an increase in the risk of vertebral fractures. 
Osteoporosis risk was higher in COPD patients on ICS 
versus COPD patients on other medications such as β2-
agonists but not including ICS. In this study there was no 
correlation between β2-agonists and osteoporosis or a dose 
response relationship with fracture risk.
This is corroborated by Pujades-Rodriguez who also 
found an increased risk, albeit small, of fractures of any bone 
with higher doses of ICS [27]. Studies investigating the link 
between ICS and osteoporosis have found a negative 
correlation in asthmatics treated with ICS with regards to 
total minimized dose and Bone Mineral Density (BMD) up 
to 0.16SD [28]. Fracture risk and osteoporosis is of 
particular concern in the elderly in whom fractures can 
almost double the mortality rate for 5-10 years post fracture 
[29].

Systemic Effects of Inhaled Corticosteroids The Open Respiratory Medicine Journal, 2014, Volume 8 61
The systemic effects of ICS are not just limited to bone 
but have also been observed to affect the dental arch and 
palate. An increased frequency of malocclusion and an open￾bite in children using ICS has also been found [30].
EYES
Cataracts are well known complications of systemic 
steroids and tend to be of central posterior location in the 
eyes. However, the etiology is still unclear [31]. The main 
postulated mechanism is gene transcription induced by 
glucocorticoids in the lens epithelium, though other indirect 
mechanisms acting on growth factors affecting lens 
development and homeostasis are suggested [32]. Also 
suggested is fluid build up in the lens fibers and lens protein 
agglutination as a result of inhibition of the sodium￾potassium pump at the lens epithelium is postulated to be the 
relevant mechanism via which corticosteroids exert their 
cataract forming effect [33].
Many earlier studies did not exclude subjects who had 
been exposed to oral corticosteroids thus confounding their 
results [34]. A cross-sectional study by Cumming concluded 
that the use of ICS is associated with the growth of nuclear 
and sub-capsular cataracts [35]. A greater lifetime exposure 
to ICS was also related to higher risk of cataract formation 
with severity being measured through analyses of lens 
photographs. However, there was no significant increase in 
the risk of cortical cataract with the use of ICS [34].
There have been reports of ICS causing other serious 
ocular complications such as open angle glaucoma, which 
can lead to permanent eye damage if not managed 
appropriately. Garb et al. found that regular and long term (3 
months or more) ICS or intranasal corticosteroid use lead to 
an increased risk of open angle glaucoma [36]. Several 
conflicting studies have been carried out in children, in 
whom cataracts are uncommon, and thus a significant 
increase in risk may not be observed [37]. Furthermore, 
some of these studies have also been confounded by 
previous exposure to oral corticosteroids [38].
Cataracts are one of the leading causes of blindness in the 
world [39]. It is thus important to establish via prospective 
studies whether ICS increase risk of cataracts as patients 
would benefit from regular monitoring of their ocular health.
EFFECTS ON IMMUNITY
There is a plethora of data evidencing the suppression of 
cell-mediated immunity by oral corticosteroids [40]. Thus far 
it is uncertain whether ICS do the same. Case reports have 
suggested that ICS may cause a recurrence of viral infections 
and tuberculosis [41, 42]. Lee et al. assessed the effects of 
high dose ICS on cell mediated immunity, using delayed 
type hypersensitivity skin testing as the measure of impaired 
cellular immunity. This small study among 18 subjects found 
that asthmatics on ICS for a duration of at least six months, 
did not have an impaired immunity compared with 
asthmatics on medications other than ICS [43]. England 
et al., who carried out a similar study, also did not find a 
suppression of cell mediated immunity with the use of high 
dose inhaled corticosteroids in healthy subjects [44]. 
However, the duration of ICS use was short (only 28 days). 
Moreover the prolonged use of low dose ICS has not been 
shown to affect cell mediated immunity either [45].
On the contrary, studies showed that fluticasone and 
budesonide, in COPD patients increased the risk of 
pneu=monia [46, 47]. Two recent studies have further 
cemented the association of inhaled corticosteroids and 
increased risk of pneumonia. The PATHOS study [48] 
assessed the yearly pneumonia events as well as hospital 
admissions and deaths due to pneumonia in patients with 
combinations of inhaled steroid and long acting beta 2 
agonists. The study revealed that patients taking fluticasone
and salmeterol were more likely to be admitted with 
pneumonia or pneumonia-related events compared to those 
on budesonide and formoterol. A further recent study by 
Suissa et al. [49] analysed a cohort of Canadian patients to 
assess the effects of inhaled corticosteroids. They confirmed 
that all ICS molecules are associated with an increased risk 
of serious pneumonia infections with fluticasone the most 
commmonly associated ICS type and having a dose-related 
risk.
EFFECTS ON GROWTH/LINEAR GROWTH
Several factors affect growth such as chronic disease, 
genetic background, suppression of the HPA axis and onset 
of puberty, and therefore it is difficult to fully assess the 
effects of steroids on growth [5]. Severe asthma therefore 
may confound the results of several studies which aim to 
determine whether ICS suppress growth. The limitations in 
studies exploring this field are: a short study duration which 
would not include final height, and the measure of growth 
such as knemometry whereby the length between the knee 
and heel is measured. Such studies confirm that oral 
prednisolone suppress lower leg growth as measured by 
knemometry and to a lesser degree, high dose ICS (>0.4 
mg/day) also suppressed growth [50]. Beclomethasone 
compared with theophylline albeit more effective at disease 
control, has been shown to reduce height velocity, 
particularly in boys [51]. This study however did not follow 
up the patients to assess final growth.
Long term studies in this field are rare. However, they 
have shown that although ICS such as high dose 
beclomethasone result in delayed puberty and slower growth 
velocity, catch up growth allows them to reach their growth 
potential (predicted adult height) [52]. Another long-term 
study comparing asthmatics and non-asthmatics found that 
after accounting for mid-parental height, predicted height for 
asthmatics was comparable to healthy controls and that ICS 
had no effect on growth [53].
A recent study assessed the effects of inhaled steroids on 
bone density and growth. The authors found that children on 
budesonide and beclomethasone dipropionate had reduced 
linear growth and this did persist for up to two years from 
treatment commencement [54].
A recent Cochrane review [55] found that regular ICS 
use even at low to medium doses was associated with a 0.48 
cm/year reduction in linear growth in children with mild to 
moderate asthma. They found that the effect decreased after 
the first year however there was limited long-term data and 
therefore could not ascertain whether ICS affected long-term 
growth.

PREGNANCY
Asthma affects a significant number of young women 
[56]. Optimal control of asthma in pregnancy is prudent to 
avoid complications in both the mother and fetus. ICS are 
the medications of choice for treating asthma in pregnancy 
and there are reports suggesting that their use in pregnancy 
reduces acute exacerbations and frequency of visits to 
primary care services [57]. Thus it is important to ensure that 
there are no major complications with their use.
Clinicians, particularly general practitioners, are often 
cautious about treating asthmatic pregnant women and feel 
that they do not have a good understanding on how to 
manage the condition safely [58]. A recent study [59] has 
also looked into non-pharmacological methods of treating 
asthma perhaps suggesting the hesitant nature among 
healthcare professionals surrounding the use of 
corticosteroids during pregnancy.
It is difficult to discern whether the reported maternal 
complications of asthma such as pre-eclampsia [60] are due 
to the medications used to treat asthma or the condition 
itself. Earlier studies suggest an association with peri-natal 
mortality and ICS [61], although this has been disproved by 
several more recent studies. One study does show however 
that there is an increased risk of preterm births with the use 
of ICS [62].
However, longer term effects of ICS on the offspring of 
women using ICS during pregnancy has not been explored 
sufficiently. Animal studies have shown that the 
cardiovascular and metabolic systems of fetus can be 
affected if exposed to glucocorticoids in-utero [63]. 
Therefore, the implications of ICS use on the fetus should be 
considered by the clinicians while prescribing the 
medications.
A prospective study by Marion et al. evaluated the 
effects of intrauterine glucocorticoid exposure in the 
offspring of 4083 women with asthma against a control 
group. The offspring were followed up to the median age of 
6.1 years. This study revealed an increased risk of metabolic 
and endocrine disorders in the in-utero ICS exposed cohort 
versus control. Risk of other disorders however was not 
increased [64].
It is possible that glucocorticoids exert their effects on 
the fetus by crossing the placenta and acting on 
glucocorticoid regulated pathways. Hodyl however reports 
that these pathways are not affected by ICS [65]. This study 
aims to continue to follow up their cohort that may reveal 
development of further complications and whether the 
metabolic and endocrine disorders persist. There is a lack of 
reports corroborating Marion et al. and furthermore, the 
association between dosage of ICS and outcome was not 
assessed, therefore subsequent studies will need to address 
this.
Large cohort studies in Swedish populations have 
specifically assessed steroid use in pregnant women and 
found that in general anti-asthmatic drugs carry no risk for 
congenital malformations [66] and specifically budesonide is 
unlikely to cause any teratogenic risk to offspring [67].
SKIN EFFECTS
Corticosteroids cause a reduction in collagen synthesis by 
the skin and this is true of both oral and inhaled steroids. 
Thinning of the dermis and increased bruising/purpura have 
been noted in patients on high dose ICS [68].
What is difficult to ascertain once again is the influence 
of oral corticosteroids on these studies as in the study by 
Capewell et al., low dose ICS did not cause increase in 
purpura or skin bruising whereas the patients on high dose 
inhaled steroids also had oral steroid treatment. However, a 
slightly larger study looked at the effects of high dose ICS 
on skin bruising found that there was increased bruising 
compared to the control group and that this bruising was 
commoner in the elderly [69].
Although one case report has suggested a link between 
ICS and acne, no subsequent studies have analyzed this 
association [70].
The implications of these findings are more related to 
patient and physician awareness rather than adverse event 
prevention. However, skin tears and the increased risk of 
infection are potential concerns. As with the other systemic 
effects, using the lowest possible dose of ICS is expected to 
reduce this risk.
INHALED CORTICOSTEROIDS AND DIABETES 
RISK OR PROGRESSION
Glucocorticoids cause hyperglycaemia by two main 
mechanisms, namely, increased gluconeogenesis in the liver 
(including increased glucagon release which stimulates 
gluconeogenesis) and decreased glucose uptake in the liver 
and adipocytes via reduced insulin binding [71].
As with oral corticosteroids, ICS have been associated 
with an increased risk of developing diabetes and also 
worsening of glycemic control in patients with known 
diabetes.
There have been few case reports acknowledging the 
worsening of glycaemic control in patients commenced on 
high dose ICS including worsening of HbA1c [72]. 
However, a small prospective double-blind randomized 
controlled trial (n=12) found no difference in HbA1c values 
in patients with known asthma or COPD and diabetes on 
inhaled steroids at six weeks [73].
A large Canadian study looking at a cohort of patients 
with COPD treated with ICS found an increased risk of 
development and progression of diabetes in ICS users, 
especially at high doses. They found a statistically 
significant 34% mean increase in the incidence of type 2 
diabetes in those patients on inhaled steroids [74].
There is enough evidence to suggest that patients with 
diabetes commenced on inhaled steroids should be 
monitored for worsening of glycemic control, and this is 
more important when higher doses of steroids are 
administered.
OTHER COMPLICATIONS
It has been difficult to confirm that ICS use is associated 
with an increased psychiatric morbidity. A study conducted 

Systemic Effects of Inhaled Corticosteroids The Open Respiratory Medicine Journal, 2014, Volume 8 63
in Netherlands in 2006 [75] analysed adverse drug reporting 
patterns in pediatric populations found that alterations in 
behavior were the commonest reported effects. The authors 
suggested that this provides more evidence of the link 
between ICS and behavioral alterations. Another study in an 
adult population on high dose ICS suggested a negative 
association with mental well being. However, it was difficult 
to conclude that this was solely due to ICS rather than 
severity of disease [76].
A recent study has looked into the risk of gastrointestinal 
side effects: ulceration, gastritis and bleeding in patients 
taking ICS [77]. The study found a slight increase in the risk 
in patients on ICS, though this was reduced on using a 
spacer. This differs from previous suggestions that there was 
no link, although further studies are required to ascertain 
whether there is an actual increase in the risk.
CONCLUSION
ICS are one of the common medications prescribed in 
both primary and secondary care. Whilst not having the same 
potency or systemic effects as oral steroids, their systemic 
effects cannot be disputed. It is imperative that clinicians are 
aware of these effects to ensure that they can be minimized 
and patients can be monitored effectively and promptly. 
There are areas with lack of sufficient evidence with regards 
to the effects of ICS, especially whether there is a link 
between psychiatric or gastrointestinal side effects, and 
further studies will allow for a more detailed assessment.
It is important to note that for the most part, low dose 
steroids have reduced side effect profile and there is a dose 
response relationship with regards to systemic effects. Also 
worth noting is the difference in patient susceptibility to 
systemic effects regardless of steroid type. From current 
evidence we can conclude that budesonide has the least 
systemic effects with fluticasone having a higher risk 
especially at doses above 400 mcg/day. Other ICS molecules 
such as ciclesonide and flunisolide still lack sufficient 
evidence to comprehensively conclude whether they have a 
better side effect profile, although initial studies are 
promising.
Thus, clinicians should be watchful about increasing ICS 
doses and perhaps consider other methods of improving 
control such as pharmacological and non pharmacological 
methods to ensure that the risk does not outweigh benefit. 
Clinicians should also try and taper doses to find the lowest 
effective dose.
KEY POINTS
• ICS have demonstrable systemic effects, especially 
on the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis.
• Among ICS molecules, fluticasone has greater 
systemic side effects than other steroids, with 
budesonide having a better systemic adverse effect 
profile.
• Newer ICS such as ciclesonide might be of better 
beneficial effects in reducing the risk of systemic 
effects.
• Clinicians should use the lowest effective dose 
(ideally less than 400 mcg/day) when commencing 
patients on ICS, and be aware of the dose-dependant 
nature of the systemic effects.
