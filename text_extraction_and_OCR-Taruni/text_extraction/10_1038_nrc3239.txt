The myriad of genetic and epigenetic alterations that 
are characteristic of all cancers provide a diverse set of 
antigens that the immune system can use to distinguish 
tumour cells from their normal counterparts. In the
case of T cells, the ultimate amplitude and quality of 
the response, which is initiated through antigen recogni￾tion by the T cell receptor (TCR), is regulated by a bal￾ance between co-stimulatory and inhibitory signals (that 
is, immune checkpoints)1,2 (FIG. 1). Under normal physio￾logical conditions, immune checkpoints are crucial for 
the maintenance of self-tolerance (that is, the prevention 
of autoimmunity) and also to protect tissues from damage 
when the immune system is responding to pathogenic 
infection. As described in this Review, the expression 
of immune-checkpoint proteins can be dysregulated by 
tumours as an important immune resistance mecha￾nism. T cells have been the major focus of efforts to 
therapeutically manipulate endogenous antitumour 
immunity owing to: their capacity for the selective rec￾ognition of peptides derived from proteins in all cellular 
compartments; their capacity to directly recognize and 
kill antigen-expressing cells (by CD8+ effector T cells; also 
known as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)); and their 
ability to orchestrate diverse immune responses (by 
CD4+ helper T cells), which integrates adaptive and innate 
effector mechanisms. Thus, agonists of co-stimulatory 
receptors or antagonists of inhibitory signals (the subject 
of this Review), both of which result in the amplifica￾tion of antigen-specific T cell responses, are the primary 
agents in current clinical testing (TABLE 1). Indeed, the 
blockade of immune checkpoints seems to unleash 
the potential of the antitumour immune response in a 
fashion that is transforming human cancer therapeutics.
T cell-mediated immunity includes multiple sequen￾tial steps involving the clonal selection of antigen￾specific cells, their activation and proliferation in second￾ary lymphoid tissues, their trafficking to sites of antigen 
and inflammation, the execution of direct effector func￾tions and the provision of help (through cytokines and 
membrane ligands) for a multitude of effector immune 
cells. Each of these steps is regulated by counterbalanc￾ing stimulatory and inhibitory signals that fine-tune the 
response. Although virtually all inhibitory signals in 
the immune response ultimately affect intracellular sig￾nalling pathways, many are initiated through membrane 
receptors, the ligands of which are either membrane￾bound or soluble (cytokines). As a general rule, co￾stimulatory and inhibitory receptors and ligands that 
regulate T cell activation are not necessarily over￾expressed in cancers relative to normal tissues, whereas 
inhibitory ligands and receptors that regulate T cell effec￾tor functions in tissues are commonly overexpressed on

The blockade of immune checkpoints 
in cancer immunotherapy
Drew M. Pardoll
Abstract | Among the most promising approaches to activating therapeutic antitumour 
immunity is the blockade of immune checkpoints. Immune checkpoints refer to a plethora of 
inhibitory pathways hardwired into the immune system that are crucial for maintaining 
self-tolerance and modulating the duration and amplitude of physiological immune responses 
in peripheral tissues in order to minimize collateral tissue damage. It is now clear that tumours 
co-opt certain immune-checkpoint pathways as a major mechanism of immune resistance, 
particularly against T cells that are specific for tumour antigens. Because many of the immune 
checkpoints are initiated by ligand–receptor interactions, they can be readily blocked by 
antibodies or modulated by recombinant forms of ligands or receptors. Cytotoxic 
T‑lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) antibodies were the first of this class of 
immunotherapeutics to achieve US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. 
Preliminary clinical findings with blockers of additional immune-checkpoint proteins, such as 
programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1), indicate broad and diverse opportunities to enhance 
antitumour immunity with the potential to produce durable clinical responses.

Quality
In immunology, this refers to 
the type of immune response 
generated, which is often 
defined as the pattern of 
cytokine production. This, in 
turn, mediates responses 
against specific types of 
pathogen. For example, CD4+
T cells can be predominantly: 
TH1 cells (characterized by IFNγ
production; these cells are 
important for antiviral and 
antitumour responses); TH2 
cells (characterized by IL‑4 and 
IL‑13 production; these cells 
are important for antihelminth 
responses); or TH17 cells 
(characterized by IL‑17 and 
IL‑22 production; these cells 
are important for mucosal 
bacterial and fungal responses).
Autoimmunity
Immune responses against an 
individual’s normal cells or 
tissues.
CD8+ effector T cells
T cells that are characterized 
by the expression of CD8. They 
recognize antigenic peptides 
presented by MHC class I 
molecules and are able to 
directly kill target cells that 
express the cognate antigen.
tumour cells or on non-transformed cells in the tumour 
microenvironment. It is the soluble and membrane￾bound receptor–ligand immune checkpoints that are 
the most druggable using agonist antibodies (for co￾stimulatory pathways) or antagonist antibodies (for 
inhibitory pathways) (TABLE 1). Therefore, in contrast to 
most currently approved antibodies for cancer therapy, 
antibodies that block immune checkpoints do not tar￾get tumour cells directly, instead they target lymphocyte 
receptors or their ligands in order to enhance endogenous 
antitumour activity.
Another category of immune-inhibitory molecules 
includes certain metabolic enzymes, such as indoleam￾ine 2,3‑dioxygenase (IDO) — which is expressed by both 
tumour cells and infiltrating myeloid cells — and argi￾nase, which is produced by myeloid-derived suppres￾sor cells3–9. These enzymes inhibit immune responses 
through the local depletion of amino acids that are 
essential for anabolic functions in lymphocytes (particu￾larly T cells) or through the synthesis of specific natural 
ligands for cytosolic receptors that can alter lympho￾cyte functions. Although this category is not covered in 
this Review, these enzymes can be inhibited to enhance 
intratumoral inflammation by molecular analogues of 
their substrates that act as competitive inhibitors or 
suicide substrates10–12.
In considering the mechanisms of action of inhibi￾tors of various immune checkpoints, it is crucial to 
appreciate the diversity of immune functions that they 
regulate. For example, the two immune-checkpoint 
receptors that have been most actively studied in the 
context of clinical cancer immunotherapy, cytotoxic 
T‑lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4; also 
known as CD152) and programmed cell death protein 1 
(PD1; also known as CD279) — which are both inhibi￾tory receptors — regulate immune responses at differ￾ent levels and by different mechanisms. The clinical 
activity of antibodies that block either of these receptors 
implies that antitumour immunity can be enhanced at 
multiple levels and that combinatorial strategies can be 
intelligently designed, guided by mechanistic consid￾erations and preclinical models. This Review focuses 
on the CTLA4 and PD1 pathways because these are 
the two immune checkpoints for which clinical infor￾mation is currently available. However, it is important 
to emphasize that multiple additional immune check￾points represent promising targets for therapeutic 
blockade based on preclinical experiments, and inhibi￾tors for many of these are under active development 
(TABLE 1).
CTLA4: the godfather of checkpoints
The biology of CTLA4. CTLA4, the first immune￾checkpoint receptor to be clinically targeted, is expressed 
exclusively on T cells where it primarily regulates the 
amplitude of the early stages of T  cell activation. 
Primarily, CTLA4 counteracts the activity of the T cell 
co-stimulatory receptor, CD28 (REFS 13–15). CD28 
does not affect T cell activation unless the TCR is first 
engaged by cognate antigen. Once antigen recognition 
occurs, CD28 signalling strongly amplifies TCR signal￾ling to activate T cells. CD28 and CTLA4 share identi￾cal ligands: CD80 (also known as B7.1) and CD86 (also 
known as B7.2)16–20. Although the exact mechanisms 
of CTLA4 action are under considerable debate, because 
CTLA4 has a much higher overall affinity for both 
ligands, it has been proposed that its expression on the 
surface of T cells dampens the activation of T cells by 
outcompeting CD28 in binding CD80 and CD86, as well 
as actively delivering inhibitory signals to the T cell21–26. 
The specific signalling pathways by which CTLA4 blocks 
T cell activation are still under investigation, although a 
number of studies suggest that activation of the protein 
phosphatases, SHP2 (also known as PTPN11) and PP2A, 
are important in counteracting kinase signals that are 
induced by TCR and CD28 (REF. 15). However, CTLA4 
also confers ‘signalling-independent’ T cell inhibition 
through the sequestration of CD80 and CD86 from 
CD28 engagement, as well as active removal of CD80 
and CD86 from the antigen-presenting cell (APC) sur￾face27. The central role of CTLA4 for keeping T cell 
activation in check is dramatically demonstrated by the 
lethal systemic immune hyperactivation phenotype of 
Ctla4‑knockout mice28,29.
Even though CTLA4 is expressed by activated CD8+
effector T cells, the major physiological role of CTLA4 
seems to be through distinct effects on the two major 
subsets of CD4+ T cells: downmodulation of helper 
T cell activity and enhancement of regulatory T (TReg) 
cell immunosuppressive activity14,30,31 (BOX 1). CTLA4 
blockade results in a broad enhancement of immune 
responses that are dependent on helper T cells and, 
conversely, CTLA4 engagement on TReg cells enhances 
their suppressive function. CTLA4 is a target gene of 
the forkhead transcription factor FOXP3 (REFS 32,33),

CD4+ helper T cells
T cells that are characterized 
by the expression of CD4. They 
recognize antigenic peptides 
presented by MHC class II 
molecules. This type of T cell 
produces a vast range of 
cytokines that mediate 
inflammatory and effector 
immune responses. They also 
facilitate the activation of CD8+
T cells and B cells for antibody 
production.
the expression of which determines the TReg cell line￾age34,35, and TReg cells therefore express CTLA4 consti￾tutively. Although the mechanism by which CTLA4 
enhances the immunosuppressive function of TReg
cells is not known, TReg cell-specific CTLA4 knockout 
or blockade significantly inhibits their ability to regu￾late both autoimmunity and antitumour immunity30,31. 
Thus, in considering the mechanism of action for 
CTLA4 blockade, both enhancement of effector CD4+
T cell activity and inhibition of TReg cell-dependent 
immunosuppression are probably important factors.
Clinical application of CTLA4‑blocking antibodies — 
the long road from mice to FDA approval. Initially, 
the general strategy of blocking CTLA4 was ques￾tioned because there is no tumour specificity to the 
expression of the CTLA4 ligands (other than for some 
myeloid and lymphoid tumours) and because the dra￾matic lethal autoimmune and hyperimmune pheno￾type of Ctla4‑knockout mice predicted a high degree of 
immune toxicity associated with blockade of this recep￾tor. However, Allison and colleagues36 used preclinical 
models to demonstrate that a therapeutic window was 
indeed achieved when CTLA4 was partially blocked with 
antibodies. The initial studies demonstrated significant
antitumour responses without overt immune toxicities 
when mice bearing partially immunogenic tumours were 
treated with CTLA4 antibodies as single agents. Poorly 
immunogenic tumours did not respond to anti‑CTLA4 as
a single agent but did respond when anti‑CTLA4 was 
combined with a granulocyte–macrophage colony￾stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-transduced cellular 
Figure 1 | Multiple co-stimulatory and inhibitory 
interactions regulate T cell responses. Depicted are 
various ligand–receptor interactions between T cells and 
antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that regulate the T cell 
response to antigen (which is mediated by peptide–
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule 
complexes that are recognized by the T cell receptor 
(TCR)). These responses can occur at the initiation of 
T cell responses in lymph nodes (where the major APCs 
are dendritic cells) or in peripheral tissues or tumours 
(where effector responses are regulated). In general, 
T cells do not respond to these ligand–receptor 
interactions unless they first recognize their cognate 
antigen through the TCR. Many of the ligands bind to 
multiple receptors, some of which deliver co-stimulatory 
signals and others deliver inhibitory signals. In general, 
pairs of co-stimulatory–inhibitory receptors that bind the 
same ligand or ligands — such as CD28 and cytotoxic 
T‑lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) — display 
distinct kinetics of expression with the co-stimulatory 
receptor expressed on naive and resting T cells, but the 
inhibitory receptor is commonly upregulated after T cell 
activation. One important family of membrane-bound 
ligands that bind both co-stimulatory and inhibitory 
receptors is the B7 family. All of the B7 family members 
and their known ligands belong to the immunoglobulin 
superfamily. Many of the receptors for more recently 
identified B7 family members have not yet been identified. 
Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) family members that bind 
to cognate TNF receptor family molecules represent a 
second family of regulatory ligand–receptor pairs. These 
receptors predominantly deliver co-stimulatory signals 
when engaged by their cognate ligands. Another major 
category of signals that regulate the activation of T cells 
comes from soluble cytokines in the microenviron￾ment. Communication between T cells and APCs is 
bidirectional. In some cases, this occurs when ligands 
themselves signal to the APC. In other cases, activated 
T cells upregulate ligands, such as CD40L, that engage

vaccine37. These findings suggested that, if there is an 
endogenous antitumour immune response in the ani￾mals after tumour implantation, CTLA4 blockade could 
enhance that endogenous response, which ultimately can 
induce tumour regression. In the case of poorly immuno￾genic tumours, which do not induce substantial endoge￾nous immune responses, the combination of a vaccine and 
a CTLA4 antibody could induce a strong enough immune 
response to slow tumour growth and in some cases 
eliminate established tumours.
These preclinical findings encouraged the produc￾tion and testing of two fully humanized CTLA4 anti￾bodies, ipilimumab and tremelimumab, which began 
clinical testing in 2000. As with virtually all anticancer 
agents, initial testing was as a single agent in patients 
with advanced disease that were not responding to con￾ventional therapy38. Both antibodies produced objective 
clinical responses in ~10% of patients with melanoma, 
but immune-related toxicities involving various tissue 
sites were also observed in 25–30% of patients, with coli￾tis being a particularly common event39–41 (FIG. 2). The 
first randomized Phase III clinical trial to be completed 
was for tremelimumab in patients with advanced mela￾noma. In this trial, 15mg per kg tremelimumab was given 
every three months as a single agent and compared with 
dacarbazine (also known as DTIC), a standard mela￾noma chemotherapy treatment. The trial showed no 
survival benefit with this dose and schedule relative to 
dacarbazine42.
However, ipilimumab fared better. Even though the 
intrinsic activity, response rates in Phase II trials and 
immune toxicity profiles were similar for both antibod￾ies, ipilimumab was more carefully evaluated at different 
doses and schedules. Additionally, more careful definition 
of algorithms for improved clinical management of the 
immune toxicities (using steroids and tumour necrosis 
factor (TNF) blockers) mitigated the overall morbidity 
and mortality that were associated with immunological 
toxicities. Interestingly, although there is evidence that 
clinical responses might be associated with immune￾related adverse events, this correlation is modest43. Finally, 
in a randomized three-arm clinical trial of patients with 
advanced melanoma that received either: a peptide 
vaccine of melanoma-specific gp100 (also known as 
PMEL) alone; the gp100 vaccine plus ipilimumab; or ipil￾imumab alone, there was a 3.5 month survival benefit for 
patients in both groups receiving ipilimumab (that is, with
or without the gp100 peptide vaccine) compared 
with the group receiving the gp100 peptide vaccine 
alone44. As ipilimumab was the first therapy to dem￾onstrate a survival benefit for patients with metastatic 
melanoma, it was approved by the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) for the treatment of advanced 
melanoma in 2010 (dacarbazine was approved on the 
basis of response rate but has not been shown to provide 
a survival benefit in patients with melanoma).
More impressive than the mean survival benefit was 
the effect of ipilimumab on long-term survival: 18% 
of the ipilimumab-treated patients survived beyond two 
years (compared with 5% of patients receiving the gp100 
peptide vaccine alone)44. In this and other studies, the
proportion of long-term survivors was higher than 
the proportion of objective responders. The finding of 
ongoing responses and survival long after completion 
of a relatively short course of therapy (four doses of
10mg per kg over 3 months) support the concept that 
immune-based therapies might re-educate the immune 
system to keep tumours in check after completion of the 
therapeutic intervention.
As with all oncology agents that benefit a limited pro￾portion of treated patients, there has been much effort 
in defining biomarkers that predict clinical responses

Natural killer (NK) cells
Immune cells that kill cells 
using mechanisms similar to 
CD8+ effector T cells but do 
not use a clonal TCR for 
recognition. Instead, they are 
activated by receptors for 
stress proteins and are 
inhibited through distinct 
receptors, many of which 
recognize MHC molecules

peptide.

to anti‑CTLA4 therapy. To date, no such pretreatment 
biomarker has been validated to the point at which it 
could be applied as part of standard-of-care therapeu￾tic decision-making, although insights have emerged 
from the identification of certain post-treatment 
immune responses that seem to correlate with clinical 
outcome45–47.
An important feature of the anti‑CTLA4 clinical 
responses that distinguishes them from conventional 
chemotherapeutic agents and oncogene-targeted small 
molecule drugs is their kinetics. Although responses to 
chemotherapies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) 
commonly occur within weeks of initial administration, 
the response to immune-checkpoint blockers is slower 
and, in many patients, delayed (up to 6 months after 
treatment initiation). In some cases, metastatic lesions 
actually increase in size on computed tomography (CT) 
or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans before 
regressing, which seems to occur owing to increased 
immune cell infiltration. These findings demand a re￾evaluation of response criteria for immunotherapeu￾tics away from the conventional time-to-progression 
or Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours 
(RECIST) objective response criteria, which were devel￾oped on the basis of experiences with chemotherapeutic 
agents and as the primary measure of drug efficacy48.
Blockade of the PD1 pathway
Another immune-checkpoint receptor, PD1, is emerg￾ing as a promising target, thus emphasizing the diversity 
of potential molecularly defined immune manipula￾tions that are capable of inducing antitumour immune 
responses by the patient’s own immune system.
The biology of the PD1 pathway. In contrast to CTLA4, 
the major role of PD1 is to limit the activity of T cells 
in peripheral tissues at the time of an inflammatory 
response to infection and to limit autoimmunity49–55
(FIG. 3). This translates into a major immune resistance 
mechanism within the tumour microenvironment56–58. 
PD1 expression is induced when T cells become acti￾vated49. When engaged by one of its ligands, PD1 inhib￾its kinases that are involved in T cell activation through 
the phosphatase SHP250, although additional signalling 
pathways are also probably induced. Also, because PD1 
engagement inhibits the TCR ‘stop signal’, this pathway 
could modify the duration of T cell–APC or T cell–
target cell contact59. Similarly to CTLA4, PD1 is highly 
expressed on TReg cells, where it may enhance their 
proliferation in the presence of ligand60. Because many 
tumours are highly infiltrated with TReg cells that prob￾ably further suppress effector immune responses, block￾ade of the PD1 pathway may also enhance antitumour 
immune responses by diminishing the number and/or 
suppressive activity of intratumoral TReg cells.
The two ligands for PD1 are PD1 ligand 1 (PDL1; also 
known as B7‑H1 and CD274) and PDL2 (also known 
as B7‑DC and CD273)50,61–63. These B7 family members 
share 37% sequence homology and arose through gene 
duplication, which has positioned them within 100 kb 
of each other in the genome63. Recently, an unexpected 
molecular interaction between PDL1 and CD80 was dis￾covered64, whereby CD80 expressed on T cells (and pos￾sibly APCs) can potentially behave as a receptor rather 
than a ligand by delivering inhibitory signals when 
engaged by PDL1 (REFS 65,66). The relevance of this inter￾action in tumour immune resistance has not yet been 
determined. Finally, genetic evidence from PD1‑deficient 
T cells suggests that both PDL1 and PDL2 may bind to 
a co-stimulatory receptor that is expressed on T cells67. 
These complex binding interactions are reminiscent 
of the CD80 and CD86 ligand pair, each of which binds 
the co-stimulatory receptor CD28 that is expressed on 
resting T cells and the inhibitory receptor CTLA4 that is 
expressed on activated T cells. However, as stated above, 
PD1 predominantly regulates effector T cell activity 
within tissue and tumours, whereas CTLA4 predomi￾nantly regulates T cell activation (FIG. 3). Understanding 
the role of these various interactions in different can￾cer settings is highly relevant for the selection of both 
antibodies and recombinant ligands for use in the clinic.
PD1 is more broadly expressed than CTLA4: it is 
induced on other activated non‑T lymphocyte subsets, 
including B cells and natural killer (NK) cells68,69, which 
limits their lytic activity. Therefore, although PD1 
blockade is typically viewed as enhancing the activity 
of effector T cells in tissues and in the tumour micro￾environment, it also probably enhances NK cell activity 
in tumours and tissues and may also enhance antibody 
production either indirectly or through direct effects on 
PD1+ B cells70.
In addition, chronic antigen exposure, such as 
occurs with chronic viral infection and cancer, can lead
to high levels of persistent PD1 expression, which 
induces a state of exhaustion or anergy among cognate 
antigen-specific T cells. This state, which has been 
demonstrated in multiple chronic viral infections in 
mice and humans, seems to be partially reversible by 
Box 1 | TReg cells in the maintenance of immune tolerance in cancer
Regulatory T (TReg) cells are crucial forthe maintenance ofself-tolerance. Their unique
genetic programme is driven by the forkhead transcription factor FOXP3, which is
encoded on the X chromosome. Foxp3‑knockout mice, and humans with homozygous
mutation of FOXP3 (which causesimmunodysregulation, polyendocrinopathy,
enteropathy and X‑linked (IPEX)syndrome) develop autoimmune syndromesinvolving
multiple organs30–33. The inhibitory activity of TReg cells on immune responsesremainsto
be completely understood, butinvolvesthe production of inhibitory cytokines,such as
transforming growth factor‑β (TGFβ), interleukin‑10 (IL‑10) and IL‑35. They are
subdivided into ‘natural’ TReg (nTReg) cells, which develop in the thymus, and ‘induced’
TReg (iTReg) cells, which accumulate in many tumours and are thoughtto represent a
majorimmune resistance mechanism. They are therefore viewed asimportant cellular
targetsfortherapy. TReg cells do not express cellsurface moleculesthat are unique to
eithersubset, butthey do express high levels of multiple immune-checkpointreceptors,
such as cytotoxic T‑lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4), programmed cell death
protein 1 (PD1), T cell membrane protein 3 (TIM3), adenosine A2a receptor(A2aR) and
lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3).Genes encoding some ofthese immune￾checkpointreceptors,such asCTLA4, are actually FOXP3 target genes. Paradoxically,
although inhibiting effector T cells,these receptorsseem to enhance TReg cell activity or
proliferation. Although an antibody thatspecifically targets TReg cells has not yet been
produced, many ofthe immune-checkpoint antibodiesin clinicaltesting probably block
the immunosuppressive activity of TReg cells as a mechanism of enhancing antitumour
immunity.

PD1‑pathway blockade71. Finally, although the major 
role of the PD1 pathway is in limiting immune effector 
responses in tissues (and tumours), it can also shift the 
balance from T cell activation to tolerance at the early 
stages of T cell responses to antigens within secondary 
lymphoid tissues (that is, at a similar stage as CTLA4). 
Taken together, these findings imply a complex set of 
mechanisms of action for PD1-pathway blockade.
Regulation of expression of PD1 and its ligands in 
tumours: constitutive versus adaptive immune resist‑
ance. PD1 is expressed on a large proportion of tumour￾infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from many different 
tumour types72,73. Some of the enhanced PD1 expres￾sion among CD4+ TILs reflects a generally high level 
of PD1 expression on TReg cells, which, as noted above, 
can represent a large proportion of intratumoral CD4+
T cells. Increased PD1 expression on CD8+ TILs may 
either reflect an anergic or exhausted state, as has been 
suggested by decreased cytokine production by PD1+
compared with PD1–
 TILs from melanomas73.
Just as PD1 is highly expressed on TILs from many 
cancers, the PD1 ligands are commonly upregulated 
on the tumour cell surface from many different human 
tumours2,56. On cells from solid tumours, the major 
PD1 ligand that is expressed is PDL1. Forced expres￾sion of PDL1 on mouse tumour cells inhibits local 
antitumour T cell-mediated responses56,74,75. Indeed, 
this combination of findings provides the basis for 
PD1‑pathway blockade to enhance antitumour effec￾tor functions in the tumour microenvironment. 
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) techniques and flow 
cytometry-based analyses of surface expression have 
shown that the selective upregulation of PD1 ligands 
in various types of human tumour is heterogeneous 
at a number of levels58. Expression patterns of PD1 
ligands may be crucial for determining the suitabil￾ity of therapeutic blockade of this pathway because 
its primary role in cancer is thought to be immune 
inhibition within the tumour microenvironment and 
because PD1 only inhibits lymphocyte function when 
it is engaged by its ligands, PDL1 and PDL2.

immune checkpoint. Depicted on the left of the figure are examples of regressions of lung (top two panels) and brain 
(lower panel) metastases in a patient with melanoma who was treated with the cytotoxic T‑lymphocyte-associated 
antigen 4 (CTLA4) antibody, ipilimumab. 25–30% of patients treated with extended doses of anti‑CTLA4 therapy can 
develop immune-related ‘on-target’ toxicities. However, the frequency of severe adverse toxicities was lower (10–15%) 
with the short course that was used in the Phase III trial that led to the approval of ipilimumab. This short-course 
regimen (4 doses at a cost of US$30,000 per dose) was recommended by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
As shown on the right of the figure, common tissues affected by immune-related toxicities from treatment with 
anti‑CTLA4 therapy include the skin (dermatitis) and the colon (colitis). Tissues that do not undergo such rapid 
regeneration as the skin and colon, such as lung and liver and the pituitary and thyroid glands, are less frequently 
affected. Immune toxicities from anti‑CTLA4 therapy are usually successfully mitigated by treatment with systemic 
steroids and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) blockers when systemic steroids are not effective. Ongoing tumour responses 
typically continue even after a course of steroids. Figure is reproduced, with permission, from REF. 39 © (2003) National

Initially, most melanoma, ovarian and lung cancer 
samples were reported to have high expression levels 
of PDL156,75,76 and, subsequently, many other human 
cancers were reported to upregulate PDL1 expression 
(reviewed in REF. 2). In addition to tumour cells, PDL1 
is commonly expressed on myeloid cells in the tumour 
microenvironment77–79. An initial report in renal can￾cer demonstrated that the expression of PDL1 on either 
tumour cells or TILs in primary tumours predicted a 
worse prognosis (decreased overall survival) relative to 
PDL1–
 tumours80. Since that report, analyses of various 
tumours have suggested that the PDL1 status can either 
correlate with poor prognosis, better prognosis or show 
no correlation with prognosis58,81–85. Probable contrib￾uting factors to the wide range of reported outcomes 
among different patient cohorts are variations in IHC 
technique, cancer type, stage of cancer analysed (most 
analyses are of primary, not metastatic, lesions) and 
treatment history.
Although most of the analyses of PD1 ligand 
expression have focused on PDL1, PDL2 has also been 
reported to be upregulated in various tumours. PDL2 
is highly upregulated on cells from certain B cell lym￾phomas, such as primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma, 
follicular cell B cell lymphoma and Hodgkin’s disease86. 
Upregulation of PDL2 on these lymphomas is com￾monly associated with gene amplification or rearrange￾ment with the class II major histocompatibility complex 
(MHC) transactivator (CIITA) locus, which is highly 
transcriptionally active in B cell lymphomas87.
Given the heterogeneity of the expression levels of 
PD1 ligands and their potential relevance as biomark￾ers for blockade of the PD1 pathway, it is important to 
understand the signals that induce the expression of 
PD1 ligands on tumour cells and also haematopoietic 
cells within the tumour microenvironment. Two general 
mechanisms for the regulation of PDL1 by tumour cells 
have emerged: innate immune resistance and adaptive 
Figure 3 | Immune checkpoints regulate different components in the evolution of an immune response. a | The 
cytotoxic T‑lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4)-mediated immune checkpoint is induced in T cells at the time of 
their initial response to antigen. The level of CTLA4 induction depends on the amplitude of the initial T cell receptor 
(TCR)-mediated signalling. High-affinity ligands induce higher levels of CTLA4, which dampens the amplitude of the initial 
response. The key to the regulation of T cell activation levels by the CD28–CTLA4 system is the timing of surface 
expression. Naive and memory T cells express high levels of cell surface CD28 but do not express CTLA4 on their surface. 
Instead, CTLA4 is sequestered in intracellular vesicles. After the TCR is triggered by antigen encounter, CTLA4 is 
transported to the cell surface. The stronger the stimulation through the TCR (and CD28), the greater the amount of 
CTLA4 that is deposited on the T cell surface. Therefore, CTLA4 functions as a signal dampener to maintain a consistent 
level of T cell activation in the face of widely varying concentrations and affinities of ligand for the TCR. b | By contrast, the 
major role of the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) pathway is not at the initial T cell activation stage but rather to 
regulate inflammatory responses in tissues by effector T cells recognizing antigen in peripheral tissues. Activated T cells 
upregulate PD1 and continue to express it in tissues. Inflammatory signals in the tissues induce the expression of PD1 
ligands, which downregulate the activity of T cells and thus limit collateral tissue damage in response to a microorganism 
infection in that tissue. The best characterized signal for PD1 ligand 1 (PDL1; also known as B7‑H1) induction is 
interferon‑γ (IFNγ), which is predominantly produced by T helper 1 (TH1) cells, although many of the signals have not yet 
been defined completely. Excessive induction of PD1 on T cells in the setting of chronic antigen exposure can induce an 
exhausted or anergic state in T cells. MHC, major histocompatibility complex.

immune resistance (not to be confused with innate and 
adaptive immunity) (FIG. 4). For some tumours, such 
as glioblastomas, it has been demonstrated that PDL1 
expression is driven by constitutive oncogenic signal￾ling pathways in the tumour cell (innate immune resist￾ance). The expression on glioblastomas is enhanced 
on deletion or silencing of PTEN, which implicates the 
involvement of the PI3K–AKT pathway88. Similarly, con￾stitutive anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) signalling, 
which is observed in certain lymphomas and occasion￾ally in lung cancer, has been reported to drive PDL1 
expression through signal transducer and activator of 
transcription 3 (STAT3) signalling89.
The alternative mechanism for PDL1 upregulation 
on tumours that has emerged from both clinical and 
preclinical studies reflects their adaptation to endog￾enous tumour-specific immune responses — a process 
termed adaptive immune resistance58 (FIG. 4). In adaptive 
immune resistance, the tumour uses the natural physiol￾ogy of PD1 ligand induction that normally occurs to pro￾tect a tissue from infection-induced immune-mediated 
damage in order to protect itself from an antitumour 
immune response. Expression of PDL1 as an adaptive 
response to endogenous antitumour immunity can 
occur because PDL1 is induced on most tumour cells in 
response to interferons (IFNs) — predominantly IFNγ 
— which also occurs in epithelial and stromal cells in 
normal tissues90–92. This mechanism represents an alter￾native to the conventional drug resistance mechanisms 
that involve the mutation of drug targets. It also contrasts 
with mechanisms of viral immune escape that involve 
the mutation of immunodominant epitopes. The mecha￾nism of adaptive immune resistance intrinsically implies 
that immunosurveillance exists even in advanced can￾cers. However, the tumour ultimately resists immune 
elimination by upregulating the expression of ligands 
for inhibitory receptors on tumour-specific lymphocytes 
that consequently inhibit antitumour immune responses 
in the tumour microenvironment.
Various preclinical and clinical studies support 
the adaptive immune resistance hypothesis. Gajewski 
and colleagues93 have shown that melanomas can be 
approximately divided into inflammatory and non￾inflammatory categories, which were defined by the 
expression of multiple inflammatory genes, includ￾ing those involved in IFN pathways. A recent study of 
melanoma demonstrated a strong correlation between 
cell surface PDL1 expression on tumour cells and both 
lymphocytic infiltration and intratumoral IFNγ expres￾sion. This correlation was not only seen among tumours 
but within individual PDL1+ tumours at the regional 
level, in which regions of lymphocyte infiltration were 
Figure 4 | Two general mechanisms of expression of immune-checkpoint ligands on tumour cells. The examples 
in this figure use the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) ligand, PDL1 (also known as B7‑H1), for illustrative purposes, 
although the concept probably applies to multiple immune-checkpoint ligands, including PDL2 (also known as B7-DC). 
a | Innate immune resistance. In some tumours, constitutive oncogenic signalling can upregulate PDL1 expression on all 
tumour cells, independently of inflammatory signals in the tumour microenvironment. Activation of the AKT and signal 
transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathways has been reported to drive PDL1 expression. b | Adaptive 
immune resistance. In some tumours, PDL1 is not constitutively expressed, but rather it is induced in response to 
inflammatory signals that are produced by an active antitumour immune response. The non-uniform expression of PDL1, 
which is commonly restricted to regions of the tumour that have tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, suggests that PDL1 is 
adaptively induced as a consequence of immune responses within the tumour microenvironment. Adaptive induction may 
be a common mechanism for the expression of multiple immune-checkpoint molecules in tumours. IFNγ, interferon-γ;

also exactly where PDL1 was expressed on both tumour 
cells and TILs58. These findings suggest that the occur￾rence of a negative feedback loop whereby IFNγ induces 
PDL1 expression, which in turn suppresses the activity 
of PD1+ T cells.
Evidence of clinical activity for PD1 blockade. Taken 
together, the general findings of increased PD1 expres￾sion by TILs and the increased PD1 ligand expression 
by tumour cells provided an important rationale for 
the capacity of antibody blockade of this pathway to 
enhance intratumoral immune responses. This was 
validated through many studies using mouse models 
of cancer, which demonstrated enhanced antitumour 
immunity through antibody blockade of PD1 or its 
ligands56,57,74. Furthermore, the relatively mild pheno￾types of Pd1 (also known as Pdcd1), Pdl1 (also known 
as Cd274 and Pdcd1lg1) and Pdl2 (also known as Cd273
and Pdcd1lg2) knockout mice suggest that blockade of 
this pathway would result in less collateral immune tox￾icity than for CTLA4 blockade, which seems to be the 
case in clinical trials.
Although the clinical experience with PD1 antibod￾ies is currently much less extensive than with CTLA4 
antibodies, the initial results look extremely promising. 
In the first Phase I clinical trial with a fully human IgG4 
PD1 antibody, there were some cases of tumour regres￾sion, including mixed responses, partial responses and a 
complete response94. Tumour regressions were observed 
in four of the five histologies examined: colon, renal and 
lung cancers and melanoma, which were also associated 
with significant increases in lymphocyte infiltration 
into metastatic tumours. In initial results from a second 
clinical trial, extending the treatment with anti‑PD1 to 
2 years, objective responses were observed in 16 out 
of 39 patients with advanced melanoma, and an addi￾tional 14 patients achieved either a mixed response 
or disease stabilization95. Similar response rates have 
been observed in renal cancer96, and there is ongo￾ing evaluation of anti‑PD1 in lung cancer. Follow-up 
on the initial clinical trial suggests that the responses 
are durable. In fact, all objective responders from the 
initial Phase I trial continued to be in remission more 
than a year after the cessation of therapy (E. Lipson and 
S. Topalian, Johns Hopkins University School of 
Medicine, personal communication).
As predicted by the distinct phenotypes of 
Pd1‑knockout mice versus Ctla4‑knockout mice, the 
frequency of immune-related toxicities from anti‑PD1 
treatment seems to be less than anti‑CTLA4 treat￾ment. For example, only 1 of 39 patients in the initial 
Phase I trial of anti‑PD1 had a severe immune-related 
adverse event. When immune-related toxicities owing to 
anti‑PD1 treatment occur, they seem to be grossly simi￾lar to those caused by anti‑CTLA4 treatment and can 
affect different organs in different patients. Ultimately, 
the efficacy of anti‑PD1 treatment awaits evaluation in 
many ongoing trials.
It is logical to imagine that the enhancement 
of antitumour immune responses on blockade of 
the PD1 pathway would substantially depend on the 
expression of a PD1 ligand by tumour cells. Analyses of 
9 patients that were treated with anti‑PD1 in the initial 
Phase I trial demonstrated a strong correlation between 
PDL1 expression and response: 0 of 5 patients with no 
membrane PDL1 expression on pretreatment biopsies 
responded to anti‑PD1 therapy, whereas 3 of 4 patients 
with >5% of tumour cells expressing PDL1 on the cell 
membrane had either an objective response or a mixed 
response. The lack of response in patients whose tumour 
cells exclusively had cytosolic PDL1 is notable because 
cytosolic PDL1 would fail to activate the PD1 pathway. 
If validated in larger series of patients, this finding sets 
the stage for a broader assessment of immune-checkpoint 
ligands and receptors as targets for antibody blockade, as 
well as for the assessment of ligand expression in tumours as
biomarkers for predicting the success of strategies that 
involve the blockade of specific immune-checkpoint 
pathways.
There are various companies that are developing 
and testing antibodies targeted to either PD1 or PDL1 
but currently there is no published information on 
their clinical performance. Based on the known inter￾actions of the PD1 ligands, it is theoretically possible 
that a PD1 antibody would have distinct biological 
activity from a PDL1 antibody. A PD1 antibody would 
block PD1 from interacting with both PDL1 and PDL2 
but not the interaction between PDL1 and CD80. By 
contrast, most PDL1 antibodies block the interaction 
between PDL1 and CD80 and between PDL1 and PD1 
but would not block PD1 from interacting with PDL2. 
Thus, it is possible that, depending on which interac￾tions dominate in a particular cancer, PD1 and PDL1 
antibodies might not have redundant activity.
Multiple promising immune checkpoints
Basic immunological studies have demonstrated that 
various immune-checkpoint receptors are expressed 
coordinately under circumstances of tolerance to self￾antigens and chronic infections, as well as in inflam￾matory settings. In addition to defined lymphocyte 
inhibitory receptors, numerous B7 family inhibitory 
ligands — in particular B7‑H3 (also known as CD276) 
and B7‑H4 (also known as B7‑S1, B7x and VCTN1) — 
do not yet have defined receptors, but mouse knockout 
experiments support an immune inhibitory role for 
these ligands97. In addition, B7‑H3 and B7‑H4 are upreg￾ulated on tumour cells or tumour-infiltrating cells98. 
B7‑H3 seems to be upregulated on endothelial cells of 
the tumour vasculature, and B7‑H4 has been reported 
to be expressed on tumour-associated macrophages97. 
Preclinical mouse models of cancer have shown 
that blockade of many of these individual immune￾checkpoint ligands or receptors can enhance antitumour 
immunity, and dual blockade of coordinately expressed 
receptors can produce additive or synergistic antitumour 
activities. Inhibitors for a number of these immune￾checkpoint targets are either entering the clinic or are 
under active development. Those described below are 
targets for which blocking antibodies or small molecule 
inhibitors are currently available but do not represent a 
comprehensive list.

Dendritic cells
Specialized immune cells that, 
when activated, present 
antigens to and activate T cells 
to initiate adaptive immune 
responses.
Lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3; also known as 
CD223), 2B4 (also known as CD244), B and T lympho￾cyte attenuator (BTLA; also known as CD272), T cell 
membrane protein 3 (TIM3; also known as HAVcr2), 
adenosine A2a receptor (A2aR) and the family of killer 
inhibitory receptors have each been associated with 
the inhibition of lymphocyte activity and in some cases the
induction of lymphocyte anergy. Antibody targeting of 
these receptors, either alone or in combination with a 
second immune-checkpoint blocker, has been shown 
to enhance antitumour immunity in animal models 
of cancer. Because many tumour cells express multiple 
inhibitory ligands, and TILs express multiple inhibi￾tory receptors, there are many opportunities to enhance 
antitumour immunity through dual or triple blockade of 
immune checkpoints. Although human blocking anti￾bodies that are specific for a number of these ‘second 
generation’ inhibitory receptors are under development, 
none have yet entered the clinic. Most of these recep￾tors are induced on T cell activation, in keeping with the 
biological theme that they have roles in feedback inhibi￾tion of T cell responses when their cognate ligands are 
present. In addition to providing inhibitory signals to 
activated effector T cells, some of these receptors, such 
as LAG3, are highly expressed on TReg cells, where they 
are important for amplifying the immunosuppressive 
activity of TReg cells99. This implies that as with CTLA4 
and PD1, these receptors have dual roles in inhibiting 
effector immune responses, and blocking antibodies 
therefore have multiple potential mechanisms of action.
LAG3 was cloned over 20 years ago as a CD4 homo￾logue100, but its function in the immune checkpoint was 
only defined in 2005 when it was shown to have a role 
in enhancing the function of TReg cells99,101. LAG3 also 
inhibits CD8+
 effector T cell functions independently of 
its role on TReg cells102. The only known ligand for LAG3 is 
MHC class II molecules, which are upregulated on some 
epithelial cancers (generally in response to IFNγ) but 
are also expressed on tumour-infiltrating macrophages 
and dendritic cells. The role of the LAG3–MHC class II 
interaction in the LAG3‑mediated inhibition of T cell 
responses is unclear because LAG3 antibodies that do 
not block the LAG3–MHC class II interaction nonethe￾less enhance T cell proliferation and effector cell func￾tions in vitro and in vivo. This interaction may be most 
important for the role of LAG3 in enhancing TReg cell 
function. LAG3 is one of various immune-checkpoint 
receptors that are coordinately upregulated on both TReg
cells and anergic T cells, and simultaneous blockade of 
these receptors can result in enhanced reversal of this 
anergic state relative to blockade of one receptor alone. 
In particular, PD1 and LAG3 are commonly co-expressed 
on anergic or exhausted T cells103,104. Dual blockade of 
LAG3 and PD1 synergistically reversed anergy among 
tumour-specific CD8+ T cells and virus-specific CD8+
T cells in the setting of chronic infection. Dramatic evi￾dence of the effects of coordinate T cell inhibition by PD1 
and LAG3 comes from Pd1–/–Lag3–/– double-knockout 
mice, which completely reject even poorly immuno￾genic tumours in a T cell-dependent manner but also 
develop autoimmune syndromes much more quickly 
than Pd1–/– or Lag3–/– single-knockout mice. The auto￾immune syndromes in Pd1–/–Lag3–/– double-knockout 
mice are ultimately fatal, although they do not develop 
as quickly as in Ctla4‑knockout mice105. These findings 
emphasize the balance between antitumour effects and 
autoimmune side effects that must be considered in all of 
the immune-checkpoint-blockade strategies.
TIM3, the ligand of which is galectin 9 (a galectin 
that is upregulated in various types of cancer, including 
breast cancers) inhibits T helper 1 (TH1) cell responses106, 
and TIM3 antibodies enhance antitumour immu￾nity107. TIM3 has also been reported to be co-expressed 
with PD1 on tumour-specific CD8+ T cells, and dual 
blockade of both molecules significantly enhances the 
in vitro proliferation and cytokine production of human 
T cells when stimulated by the cancer–testes antigen, 
NY‑ESO‑1. In animal models, coordinate blockade of 
PD1 and TIM3 was reported to enhance antitumour 
immune responses and tumour rejection in circum￾stances in which only modest effects from blockade of 
each individual molecule were observed108–110.
BTLA was first identified as an inhibitory receptor on 
T cells on the basis of the enhanced T cell responses that 
were observed in Btla-knockout mice111. Subsequently, 
herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM; also known as 
TNFRSF14) — which is expressed on certain tumour 
cell types (for example, melanoma) as well as on tumour￾associated endothelial cells — was shown to be the BTLA 
ligand112. This is a rare case in which a TNF family mem￾ber interacts with an immunoglobulin supergene family 
member. BTLA expression levels on activated virus￾specific CD8+ T cells are quite low, but can be much 
higher on TILs from patients with melanoma. BTLAhi
T cells are inhibited in the presence of its ligand, HVEM. 
Thus, BTLA may also be a relevant inhibitory receptor 
for T cells in the tumour microenvironment113. The sys￾tem of HVEM-interacting molecules is complex: two 
additional interacting molecules, CD160 (an immuno￾globulin superfamily member) and LIGHT (also known 
as TNFSF14, a TNF family member), seem to mediate 
inhibitory and co-stimulatory activity, respectively. It 
also seems that signalling can be bidirectional, depend￾ing on the specific combination of interactions. The 
complexity of this system makes therapeutic inhibition 
strategies less straightforward than for other inhibitory 
receptors or ligands, although dual blockade of BTLA 
and PD1 clearly enhances antitumour immunity114.
A2aR, the ligand of which is adenosine, inhibits T cell 
responses, in part by driving CD4+ T cells to express 
FOXP3 and hence to develop into TReg cells115. Deletion of 
this receptor results in enhanced and sometimes patho￾logical inflammatory responses to infection. This receptor 
is particularly relevant to tumour immunity because the 
rate of cell death in tumours from cell turnover is high, 
and dying cells release adenosine. In addition, TReg cells 
express high levels of the exoenzymes CD39 (also known 
as NTPDase 1), which converts extracellular ATP to AMP, 
and CD73 (also known as 5′-NT), which converts AMP to 
adenosine116. Given that A2aR engagement by adenosine 
drives T cells to become TReg cells, this can produce a self￾amplifying loop within the tumour. Indeed, tumours grow

been tested clinically in patients with cancer.
Killer inhibitory receptors are a broad category of 
inhibitory receptors that can be divided into two classes 
based on structure: killer cell immunoglobulin-like 
receptors (KIRs) and C‑type lectin receptors, which are 
type II transmembrane receptors118–120. These receptors 
were originally described as crucial regulators of the kill￾ing activity of NK cells, although many are expressed on 
T cells and APCs121. The importance of their inhibitory 
role on T cells and APCs (for example, dendritic cells) 
is less well studied but the resulting activation of NK 
cells can provide potent antitumour activity. Many of
the killer inhibitory receptors are specific for subsets 
of human leukocyte antigens (HLAs; the human MHC 
molecules) and possess allele-specificity. However, 
other receptors recognize broadly expressed molecules; 
for example, the C‑type lectin receptor KLRG1 recog￾nizes E‑cadherin. The potential value of NK cells in 
antitumour immune responses when their inhibitory 
receptors are not appropriately engaged is best exem￾plified by the significantly enhanced graft-versus-tumour 
effects in allogeneic bone marrow transplants elicited by 
mismatches between donor NK inhibitory receptors and 
recipient HLA alleles. The big question in therapeutic 
blockade of NK inhibitory receptors is which among the 
>20 receptors should be targeted?
Future prospects: biomarkers and combinations 
There is nothing like a clinical success to open up a new 
area of therapeutics. The FDA approval of anti‑CTLA4 
therapy, quickly followed by reports of encouraging pre￾liminary clinical data for anti‑PD1 therapy, has engen￾dered a new-found awareness among oncologists of the 
potential antitumour activity of a patient’s endogenous 
immune system once the ‘brakes’ elicited by the immune 
system have been released. As described above, these 
immune checkpoints are a tiny fraction of the receptors 
and ligands that have been defined by genetic and biologi￾cal analyses to inhibit specific types of immune responses 
at various levels. The opportunities to explore therapeu￾tically the plethora of potential immune-checkpoint tar￾gets bring forth two challenges. First is the definition of 
potential biomarkers that can determine which immune￾checkpoint pathway or pathways dominate in a particu￾lar tumour — this will be crucial to guide the choice of 
inhibitor. In the case of immune-checkpoint pathways 
that primarily operate in the tumour microenvironment, 
such as the PD1 pathway, the expression of the key ligands 
and receptors in tumour biopsies are certainly the most 
obvious potential determinants of responsiveness to path￾way blockade. It is also possible that specific oncogenic 
pathways, such as PI3K–AKT or STAT3 (which are con￾stitutively activated in some tumours), may induce the 
expression of specific immune-inhibitory molecules and 
could thus be used as surrogate biomarkers.
The second challenge is the clinical development of 
combinatorial approaches. Preclinical models validate 
dramatic synergy between tumour vaccines and inhi￾bition of most of the immune checkpoints described 
here. Anti‑CTLA4 therapy strongly enhances the ampli￾tude of vaccine-induced antitumour responses in many 
poorly immunogenic tumour models, as does anti‑PD1 
therapy37,122. The concept of adaptive immune resistance 
— whereby immune-checkpoint ligands such as PDL1 
are induced in tumours in response to an endogenous 
antitumour immune response — suggests that PD1-
pathway blockade as a monotherapy will only succeed 
in the setting of a pre-existing antitumour immune 
response in the patient. However, expanded efficacy 
might be achieved when PD1-pathway blockade is com￾bined with a vaccine or any other therapy that induces 
de novo antitumour immune responses (FIG. 5). As is cov￾ered in detail elsewhere in this issue123, emerging stud￾ies demonstrate that targeted cancer therapies that are 
not conventionally thought of as immunotherapies can 
elicit or enhance antitumour immunity. Such therapies 
include: vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)–
VEGF receptor (VEGFR) inhibitors; RAF inhibitors; 
certain chemotherapeutic agents; antibodies targeted 
to receptor tyrosine kinases that are overexpressed in 
tumours; and epigenetic therapies. These therapies 
may therefore force the tumours to upregulate immune 
checkpoints that consequently can be blocked as part of a 
combinatorial strategy.
Figure 5 | Implications of the adaptive immune resistance mechanism for 
combinatorial immunotherapy of cancer. The adaptive immune resistance 
mechanism implies that the blockade of an induced immune-checkpoint protein, such as 
programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1), as a single intervention will only induce tumour 
regressions when there is a pre-existing antitumour immune response to be ‘unleashed’ 
when the pathway is blocked. Multiple interventions, such as vaccines, that activate a 
de novo antitumour immune response may not induce tumour regressions because 
tumours respond by upregulating immune-checkpoint ligands. Therefore, combining the 
two approaches may induce tumour regressions in patients that would not have 
responded to either treatment alone. PDL1, PD1 ligand 1; TAM, tumour-associated 
macrophage.
