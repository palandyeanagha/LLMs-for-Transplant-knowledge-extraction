Introduction: Alcoholic hepatitis is associated with a high short term mortality. We aimed to identify those
factors associated with mortality and define a simple score which would predict outcome in our
population.
Methods: We identified 241 patients with alcoholic hepatitis. Clinical and laboratory data were recorded
on the day of admission (day 1) and on days 6–9. Stepwise logistic regression was used to identify
variables related to outcome at 28 days and 84 days after admission. These variables were included in the
Glasgow alcoholic hepatitis score (GAHS) and its ability to predict outcome assessed. The GAHS was
validated in a separate dataset of 195 patients.
Results: The GAHS was derived from five variables independently associated with outcome: age
(p = 0.001) and, from day 1 results, serum bilirubin (p,0.001), blood urea (p = 0.019) and, from day 6–9
results, serum bilirubin (p,0.001), prothrombin time (p = 0.002), and peripheral blood white blood cell
count (p = 0.001). The GAHS on day 1 had an overall accuracy of 81% when predicting 28 day outcome.
In contrast, the modified discriminant function had an overall accuracy of 49%. Similar results were found
using information at 6–9 days and when predicting 84 day outcome. The accuracy of the GAHS was
confirmed by the validation study of 195 patients The GAHS was equally accurate irrespective of the use of
the international normalised ratio or prothrombin time ratio, or if the diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis was
biopsy proven or on the basis of clinical assessment.
Conclusions: Using variables associated with mortality we have derived and validated an accurate scoring
system to assess outcome in alcoholic hepatitis. This score was able to identify patients at greatest risk of
death throughout their admission.
Alcoholic hepatitis is perhaps the most florid manifesta￾tion of alcoholic liver disease. The more severe forms of
this condition are associated with a high mortality.
Identification of those patients at greatest risk of death is
vital not only for decisions relating to individual manage￾ment but also for the design of clinical studies assessing
possible treatments for this condition.
In 1978 the discriminant function (DF) was first described
in a placebo controlled study of the benefit of corticosteroid
therapy in 55 patients with alcoholic hepatitis.1 DF was
calculated between seven and 12 days after admission.
Patients with a DF .93 and treated with placebo had a
25% 28 day survival while those with a score (93 had a
survival of 100%. In 1989 the DF was modified in the context
of a further placebo controlled corticosteroid trial involving
66 patients.2 A modified DF (mDF) of .32 and/or the
presence of encephalopathy in placebo treated patients was
associated with a 65% 28 day survival. A recent reanalysis of
a previously published placebo controlled corticosteroid trial
confirmed this observation, with a 68% 28 day survival in
placebo treated patients with an mDF >32 while those with a
score ,32 had a survival of 93%.3 The American College of
Gastroenterology has recommended that the mDF be used to
assess the severity of alcoholic hepatitis and a threshold of 32
be used to consider corticosteroid therapy.4 More recently, the
MELD score has been applied to alcoholic hepatitis. In a
study of 34 patients identified with a MELD score of .11,
there was 45% 30 day survival while those with a score (11
had a survival of 96% (table 1).5
Our own clinical experience indicated that the mDF did not
clearly identify those patients at greatest risk and indeed the
published studies suggest that most patients with an mDF
.32 survive without treatment. We wished to identify those
factors associated with a poor outcome in our population of
patients with alcoholic hepatitis. The ultimate aim was to
create and validate a simple clinically useful score which was
easily calculable from readily available variables, and which
may better inform decisions regarding treatment by more
accurately identifying patients with higher mortality than the
currently available scoring systems.
METHODS
Analysis of prognostic factors and development of the
Glasgow alcoholic hepatitis score
We identified patients presenting with alcoholic liver disease
to the Glasgow Royal Infirmary and the Victoria Infirmary,
Glasgow. Patients had a history of excessive alcohol ingestion
until at least three weeks before admission and a serum
bilirubin level of >80 mmol/l on admission. No patient was
treated with corticosteroids or pentoxifylline. Patients were
excluded if they had an inpatient stay of less than 48 hours
either because of early death or discharge from hospital, or if
they presented with gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Patients
with evidence, either initially or subsequently, of viral

hepatitis, autoimmune liver disease, biliary obstruction, or
hepatocellular carcinoma were excluded.
Patient records were reviewed and the findings on clinical
examination at the time of admission were documented.
Results of standard laboratory tests were also recorded on the
day of admission (day 1) and between days 6–9 after
admission. The outcome of the admission episode, and short
term (28 day) and medium term (84 day) mortality were also
documented.
Stepwise logistic regression was used to identify variables
which were independently associated with short and medium
term outcome. Based on the variables identified by the
logistic regression analysis, a simple scoring system for
severity of disease was derived. Comparison of accuracies
was performed using x2 analysis. Analysis was performed
using SPSS version 10.0.7.
Validation of the Glasgow alcoholic hepatitis score
(GAHS)
In order to validate the Glasgow alcoholic hepatitis score, we
identified patients presenting to eight hospitals throughout
the UK: Glasgow, Newcastle, London, Birmingham,
Sandwell, Dudley, Edinburgh, and North Staffordshire. All
patients had a serum bilirubin level >80 mmol/l and a history
of recent alcohol excess. As in the initial dataset, patients
with viral hepatitis, autoimmune liver disease, or hepatocel￾lular carcinoma were excluded.
The GAHS was calculated for each patient. mDF was
calculated if prothrombin time was measured. The MELD
score was calculated if the international normalised ratio
(INR) was measured. These scores were calculated on the day
of admission (day 1) and on day 7. Outcome was related to
survival at day 28 and day 84. There was inevitably a degree
of heterogeneity in recruitment of patients between the
different hospitals, as detailed in table 2. No patients was
treated with corticosteroids or pentoxifylline. Patients treated
with antioxidant therapy were included as no improvement
in survival was seen with their use.
RESULTS
Analysis of prognostic factors and derivation of the
GAHS
Patient population
In total, 241 patients were identified. Their clinical char￾acteristics are shown in table 3. Overall survival was 77% and
68% at days 28 and 84, respectively. Patients with an
admission mDF of >32 had a survival of 71% and 62% at
days 28 and 84, respectively.
Logistic regression
Variables considered predictive of 28 and 84 day outcome
were age, sex, the presence of ascites, the presence of
encephalopathy, day 1 sodium, day 1 blood urea, and serum
bilirubin, serum albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), the ALT to AST ratio,
alkaline phosphatase, prothrombin time, and peripheral
white blood cell count (all on day 1 and on days 6–9).
Factors independently associated with 28 day mortality
identified by stepwise logistic regression were age (p = 0.001)
and, from day 1 results, serum bilirubin (p,0.001), serum
albumin (p = 0.025), blood urea (p = 0.019), and the
presence of encephalopathy (p = 0.028) and, from day 6–9
results, serum bilirubin (p,0.001), prothrombin time

(p = 0.002), and peripheral blood white blood cell count
(p = 0.001).
Factors independently associated with 84 day mortality
identified by stepwise logistic regression were age (p = 0.006)
and, from day 1 results, serum bilirubin (p = 0.001), serum
albumin (p = 0.022), blood urea (p = 0.001), and the AST to
ALT ratio (p = 0.018) and, from day 6–9 results, serum
bilirubin (p,0.001), prothrombin time (p,0.001), and peri￾pheral blood white blood cell count (p = 0.009).
Development of the scoring system
Of the variables associated with outcome, we selected five for
the derivation of a scoring system: patient age, blood urea
(mmol/l), peripheral blood white cell count (109
/l), serum
bilirubin (mmol/l), and prothrombin time, expressed as a ratio
of the control value. The GAHS was calculated as the sum of
the scores derived (table 4). Values obtained ranged from 5 to
12. There was a marked rise in mortality when a score greater
than 8 was attained, and a receiver operating curve (fig 1)
suggests that using scores greater than 8 to define poor
prognosis is optimum for simultaneous maximisation of
sensitivity and specificity.
Based on this cut point, the GAHS lacked sensitivity but
had a far superior specificity and overall accuracy relative to
the mDF (table 5). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for both
mDF and the GAHS is shown in fig 2.
Validation of the GAHS
Patient population
In total, 195 patients were studied. Of these, 65 (33.3%) had
biopsy proven alcoholic hepatitis. Overall survival was 71%
and 63% at days 28 and 84, respectively. Patients with an
admission mDF of >32 (n = 118) had a survival of 64% and
52% at days 28 and 84, respectively. Survival in relation to
individual GAHS values as well as for patients with a GAHS
value ,9 or >9 is shown in table 6.

There were 134 patients with a calculable mDF. On
comparison with the mDF, the GAHS at days 1 and 7 was
significantly more accurate in predicting 28 day outcome
than the mDF (p = 0.0016 and p = 0.0038 respectively). The
day 1 and 7 GAHS was more accurate than the mDF score in
predicting day 84 outcome (p = 0.0179 and p = 0.0477,
respectively) (table 7). There were 46 patients whose
coagulation was measured as an INR and had a calculable
MELD score, but whose mDF was not able to be calculated. In
these patients, GAHS was calculated using the INR rather
than the prothrombin time ratio. On comparison with the
MELD score, the GAHS day 7 was significantly more accurate
in predicting 28 day outcome than the MELD score
(p = 0.0339), but the day 1 GAHS just failed to be
significantly more accurate than the MELD (p = 0.0686).
The day 1 and 7 GAHS was more accurate than the MELD
score in predicting day 84 outcome (p = 0.0005 for both
scores) (table 8). There were 63 patients with liver biopsy
confirming alcoholic hepatitis. There were no differences in
the accuracy of the GAHS between biopsied patients and 70
patients who did not have a liver biopsy (table 9).
DISCUSSION
Early identification of patients with alcoholic hepatitis at
greatest risk of death is necessary for potentially beneficial
treatments to be instituted. A significant proportion of
patients will deteriorate after initial presentation. It would
be advantageous to accurately identify patients who might
benefit from intervention before their clinical condition
worsened.
The variables we identified which were associated with
poor outcome were similar to those noted by other observers.
One other study noted that prothrombin time, white cell
count, patient’s age, and creatinine were related to mortality
on logistic regression analysis.6 We excluded encephalopathy
as a factor in our score as assessment of this can be extremely
subjective in its milder forms. In addition, we did not include
the presence of ascites as patients may undergo paracentesis
during their admission. Thus the significance of this variable
may be lost prospectively. For similar reasons, serum albumin
was not used as intravenous albumin infusions are given in
the management of large volume paracentesis, spontaneous
bacterial peritonitis, or hepatorenal syndrome. Despite serum
creatinine being a significant variable, we decided to use
blood urea as a marker of renal function. This was largely to
widen the clinical applicability of the score. Measurement of
serum creatinine is based on the Jaffe reaction by many
analysers. Unless a correction is performed, creatinine will be
underestimated in the context of hyperbilirubinaemia.7 Such
biochemical correction may not be immediately available,
thus rendering a creatinine based score inapplicable in many
clinical situations. In our initial dataset, the GAHS did
perform equally well when serum creatinine, with a thresh￾old of 100 mmol/l, was used in place of blood urea. For similar
reasons of universal applicability, we decided to use the
prothrombin time expressed as a ratio of the control value.
This avoids the difficulties of differing assays for prothrombin
time being used in different laboratories.8
In our initial population, mDF was highly sensitive in the
prediction of death from alcoholic hepatitis but lacked
specificity. It incorrectly predicted the outcome at 28 days
after admission in 51% of cases. Other practical difficulties
beset the mDF. The formula relies on the absolute value of
prothrombin time and, as mentioned above, there exists
significant variation in the absolute values of prothrombin
time obtained using different assays.8 This creates an
inherent inaccuracy in the mDF value and limits its
translation between different clinical practices.
The validation study confirmed the accuracy of the GAHS
relative to the mDF. There were however differences in the
sensitivities and specificities of the GAHS between the
derivation and validation datasets. GAHS was more sensitive
in the validation dataset without significant loss of specifi￾city. This may be because a large number of patients were
identified as part of randomised controlled trials in two of the
validation centres (Newcastle and London) whose entry
criteria required an mDF >32. Thus patients with more
severe alcoholic hepatitis would be selected, as reflected in
the higher mortality in the validation population relative to

the derivation group. As the GAHS is more specific for
mortality, sensitivity would also increase in a population with
an overall worse prognosis.
The validation population was heterogeneous; it included
patients assessed immediately on admission as well as those
referred on for tertiary care. Some patients had biopsy proven
alcoholic hepatitis and some had their coagulation measured
using the INR rather than prothrombin time. In each of these
subgroups, the score retained its accuracy which we believe
supports the universal applicability of the GAHS.
Patients from whom we derived the GAHS did not have
biopsy proven alcoholic hepatitis. Therefore, strictly speaking,
the score assessed patients with alcoholic liver disease
presenting with jaundice. However, similar clinical defini￾tions of alcoholic hepatitis were used in the development and
testing of the discriminant functions and also have been used
for recruitment of patients into clinical trials.9–12 While some
trials have required histological confirmation of alcoholic
hepatitis,13 others have indicated that liver biopsies of those
presenting with the clinical syndrome alcoholic hepatitis
confirm the diagnosis in over 80% of cases.14 To further
vindicate the applicability of the GAHS, the validation study
indicated no difference in accuracy between biopsy proven
and alcoholic hepatitis diagnosed on clinical grounds. Thus
the GAHS appears to be applicable to clinical practice.
In the initial analysis, we were not in a position to calculate
the MELD score as the INR was not measured in these
patients, and INR and prothrombin time ratio are not
necessarily equivalent. However, in the validation study it
proved possible to compare the accuracy of the GAHS (using
the INR rather than prothrombin time ratio) with the MELD
score. The GAHS proved more accurate than the MELD score.
In common with the mDF, the MELD score is similarly
difficult to calculate at the bedside and inclusion of creatinine
in the MELD may also limit its usefulness, as already
discussed. In addition, the study by Sheth and colleagues5 did
not demonstrate the superiority of the MELD score over the
mDF. Another study of 98 patients with alcoholic hepatitis
indicated that the MELD score was as useful as the Child￾Pugh score but no comparison with the mDF was made.15
In addition to informing individual patient management,
an accurate scoring system would also help in structuring
clinical trials in alcoholic hepatitis. On the basis of expected
response from clinical studies, no published clinical study has
been adequately powered to identify a significant fall in
mortality with corticosteroid treatment. It might be that
much of the longstanding debate regarding the use of
corticosteroids is due in part to the entry criterion of an
mDF >32 being inadequately specific for mortality.
In conclusion, we have identified factors related to
mortality in patients presenting with clinical alcoholic
hepatitis. Using these factors we have created a scoring
system for patients which is simple to calculate and has a
high degree of accuracy in predicting mortality. This score has
been validated in a second data set.

Clinical Evidence—Call for contributors
Clinical Evidence is a regularly updated evidence-based journal available worldwide both as
a paper version and on the internet. Clinical Evidence needs to recruit a number of new
contributors. Contributors are healthcare professionals or epidemiologists with experience in
evidence-based medicine and the ability to write in a concise and structured way.
Areas for which we are currently seeking authors:
N Child health: nocturnal enuresis
N Eye disorders: bacterial conjunctivitis
N Male health: prostate cancer (metastatic)
N Women’s health: pre-menstrual syndrome; pyelonephritis in non-pregnant women
However, we are always looking for others, so do not let this list discourage you.
Being a contributor involves:
N Selecting from a validated, screened search (performed by in-house Information
Specialists) epidemiologically sound studies for inclusion.
N Documenting your decisions about which studies to include on an inclusion and exclusion
form, which we keep on file.
N Writing the text to a highly structured template (about 1500–3000 words), using evidence
from the final studies chosen, within 8–10 weeks of receiving the literature search.
N Working with Clinical Evidence editors to ensure that the final text meets epidemiological
and style standards.
N Updating the text every six months using any new, sound evidence that becomes available.
The Clinical Evidence in-house team will conduct the searches for contributors; your task is
simply to filter out high quality studies and incorporate them in the existing text.
N To expand the topic to include a new question about once every 12–18 months.
If you would like to become a contributor for Clinical Evidence or require more information
about what this involves please send your contact details and a copy of your CV, clearly
stating the clinical area you are interested in, to Klara Brunnhuber (kbrunnhuber@
bmjgroup.com).
Call for peer reviewers
Clinical Evidence also needs to recruit a number of new peer reviewers specifically with an
interest in the clinical areas stated above, and also others related to general practice. Peer
reviewers are healthcare professionals or epidemiologists with experience in evidence-based
medicine. As a peer reviewer you would be asked for your views on the clinical relevance,
validity, and accessibility of specific topics within the journal, and their usefulness to the
intended audience (international generalists and healthcare professionals, possibly with
limited statistical knowledge). Topics are usually 1500–3000 words in length and we would
ask you to review between 2–5 topics per year. The peer review process takes place
throughout the year, and our turnaround time for each review is ideally 10–14 days.
If you are interested in becoming a peer reviewer for Clinical Evidence, please
complete the peer review questionnaire at www.clinicalevidence.com or contact Klara
Brunnhuber (kbrunnhuber@bmjgroup.com).
