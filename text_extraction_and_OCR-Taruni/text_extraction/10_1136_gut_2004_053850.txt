rompt removal of unwanted cells, such as senescent, damaged, genetically mutated, or virus
infected cells, is crucial for the maintenance of liver health. This process is naturally achieved
through a highly regulated programmed form of cell death called apoptosis. In healthy
organisms, the number of cells eliminated by apoptosis equals the number of cells generated by
mitosis, ensuring the proper organ homeostasis. In addition, ‘‘physiological’’ apoptosis allows the
removal of cells with virtually no release of proinflammatory cytokines and minimal immune
response. However, in pathophysiological situations, the balance between cell proliferation and
cell death is often altered, with the consequent loss of tissue homeostasis and the onset of several
liver diseases. Insufficient apoptosis, with failure of removal of cells carrying mutated genes, and
unregulated proliferation within the context of a persistent inflammatory milieu, can promote the
development of liver and biliary cancer.1–4 Paradoxically, a chronic apoptotic stimulus can also
predispose to cancer development due to the high rate of regeneration invoked in the tissue,
which elevates the risk of mitotic errors. In contrast, excessive and/or sustained apoptosis can lead
to acute injuries, such as fulminant hepatitis and reperfusion damage,5 6 or even chronic
sustained injuries, such as alcoholic liver disease, cholestatic liver disease, and viral hepatitis.7–10
Therefore, therapeutic strategies to inhibit apoptosis in liver injury, or selectively kill malignant
cells in tumours, have the potential to provide a powerful tool for the treatment of liver disease.
Indeed, with an improved understanding of the molecular pathways and the pathophysiological
role of apoptosis, new drugs aimed at therapeutically modulating apoptosis are now available for
clinical trials and/or as new therapeutic options for the treatment of several human diseases. In
this review, we will focus on the role of apoptosis in selected liver diseases, such as alcoholic liver
disease, viral hepatitis, cholestatic liver diseases, non-alcoholic liver disease, and hepatocellular
carcinoma.11–14 We will also review some pro- and antiapoptotic therapies currently in use (or in
clinical trial) or potentially useful for the treatment of human diseases, including liver diseases.
c DEFINITION OF APOPTOSIS
Apoptosis is a highly organised and genetically controlled type of cell death, essential during
embryonic development to ensure proper organogenesis15 as well as for the health of adult
organisms. It is characterised by a number of distinct morphological alterations, such as
chromatin condensation and marginalisation, cell shrinkage, and plasma membrane blebbing,
which are accompanied by biochemical features such as DNA fragmentation, membrane
alterations (that is, exposure of phosphatidylserine on the outside of the plasma membrane), and
degradation of specific cellular proteins, as a result of the massive activation of a large number of
intracellular proteases and endonucleases. In the latest stages, the dying cell is fragmented into
membrane bound vesicles containing relatively intact organelles and chromatin residues named
‘‘apoptotic bodies’’16 which are readily engulfed by neighbouring cells and professional
phagocytes, such as resident macrophages or, in the liver, by Kupffer cells (fig 1). Supposedly,
the efficient clearance of dead cells prevents triggering of the immune response that may follow
spontaneous lysis of the apoptotic bodies and release of proinflammatory cytokines, making it
ideal for remodelling of the tissue. Perhaps the most remarkable feature of apoptosis is its highly
regulated nature. Apoptosis occurs through activation of a cell death machinery via specific
molecular pathways that are under the tight control of a complex network of proteins and their
endogenous inhibitors. This allows the cell to control its fate by starting the apoptotic programme
and relieving the apoptotic inhibitions, whenever is necessary, or preventing the engagement of
the death machinery under normal conditions. The control occurs mainly at checkpoints in the
pathways that can also potentially be used as targets for therapeutic modulation of apoptosis.
Many of the above concepts are however likely not relevant to ‘‘apoptosis’’ in pathobiology.
Whereas physiological apoptosis is tightly restricted to discrete subsets of cells, both spatially and
temporally, pathological apoptosis involves large numbers of cells, is non-selective, can be
sustained over time, and often occurs in an inflammatory milieu. Therefore, the concept of

apoptosis in disease must be re-evaluated. For example, we
now know that single disruption of an antiapoptotic gene
results in sustained serum ALT elevations,17 and specific
apoptotic protease mediated cleavage products circulate in
the serum of HCV infected individuals.18 Obviously, based on
these observations, it is clear that sustained apoptosis is
associated with release of cellular constituents into the
extracellular space and serum. Lipid products from apoptotic
cells can also serve as chemotactic factors and recruit
inflammatory cells (fig 1).19 Apoptosis of liver cells has now
been linked to liver fibrosis in several studies. Thus the
physiological concept that liver cell apoptosis is ‘‘innocuous’’
cannot be transferred to pathological apoptosis.
MECHANISMS OF APOPTOSIS
In order to develop new strategies aimed at modulating
apoptosis in the treatment of liver disease, it is necessary to
understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate the
apoptotic process.
Although apoptosis can be triggered by several different
stimuli, apoptotic signalling within the cell is transduced
mainly via two defined molecular pathways: the death
receptor pathway (also called the extrinsic pathway) and
the mitochondrial pathway (also called the intrinsic path￾way). The end point of both the intrinsic and extrinsic
pathways is activation of a wide variety of intracellular
proteases (especially a group of proteolytic enzymes called
caspases) and endonucleases that ultimately degrade the
cellular constituents. The extrinsic pathway originates at the
plasma membrane following the engagement of a family of
cytokine receptors named death receptors (such as tumour
necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNF-R1), Fas/CD95, and tumour
necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand receptors 1
and 2 (TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2)) by their cognate ligands
(TNF-a, Fas ligand (FasL)/CD95L, TRAIL).20 Ligand/receptor
binding induces the recruitment of several adapter proteins
and proenzymes (that is, procaspase-8 and -10) at the
intracellular domain of the receptor to form a complex
usually referred to as DISC (death inducing signalling
complex). The signal generated at the DISC by activated
caspases results in cell death which, depending on the cell
type, may or may not require the involvement of mitochon￾dria for its execution (fig 2). The intrinsic pathway is
triggered by different extra- or intracellular signals, such as
c irradiations, oxidative stress, toxins, reactive intermediates
of xenobiotic metabolism, endoplasmic reticulum stress
inducing factors, growth factor deprivation, or some chemo￾therapeutic drugs which induce mitochondrial dysfunc￾tion.21 22 As a result, organelle architecture and membrane
permeability are altered, and mitochondrial proteins are
released into the cytosol, including proapoptogenic factors
such as cytochrome c, SMAC/DIABLO (second mitochondria
derived activator of caspases/direct IAP binding protein with
low pI), HtrA2/Omi, apoptosis inducing factor, and endonu￾clease G (fig 3), which contribute to protease activation and
c Under physiological conditions, apoptosis is a highly
regulated form of cell death, crucial for the development
and proper functioning of all multicellular organisms.
c Pathological apoptosis occurs in an unregulated fashion,
and can be sustained and injurious.
c Several diseases, including many liver diseases, are
associated with dysregulation of apoptosis.
c Therapeutic modulation of apoptosis may represent a
valid strategy for the treatment of human liver diseases.

examination of a liver section from a patient with hepatitis C virus by

Figure 2 Death receptor mediated (extrinsic) pathway of apoptosis.
Schematic representation of signalling through the main death
receptors (Fas/CD95, tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNF-R1),
tumour necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand receptors 1
and 2 (TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2)). Engagement of death receptors by
their cognate ligands results in oligomerisation of the receptor and
recruitment of adaptor proteins (Fas associated protein with death
domain (FADD), TNF-R1 associated death domain protein (TRADD)),
which in turn bind the inactive initiator caspase-8 and/or -10. The
resulting complex is referred to as the death inducing signalling
complex (DISC). The close proximity of several procaspase molecules
results in activation of the caspase by self processing. Active initiator
caspases can directly activate downstream caspases such as caspase-3,
-6, and -7, or engage the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis by
cleavage and activation of the BH3 only protein Bid (see fig 3 for
details).

chromatin degradation. The extrinsic and intrinsic pathways
are not mutually exclusive, as some cells, including hepato￾cytes and cholangiocytes, have been shown to require
mitochondrial involvement to amplify the apoptotic signal
from death receptors.
A group of proteases, in particular the caspases (cysteinyl
aspartate specific proteases), play a central role as executors
of the cell death programme.23 Caspases are constitutively
expressed as inactive proenzymes and generally require
proteolytic processing for their activation. As caspases cleave
substrates on the carboxy terminal side of an Asp residue,
and they also require cleavage at Asp sites to acquire their
catalytic activity, caspases are capable of self activation, as
well as of activating each other in a cascade-like process.
Among the 14 mammalian caspases identified to date, 12 of
which have also been cloned in humans, some are primarily
involved in apoptosis (caspases-2, -3, -6, -7, -8, -9, -10, and
-12). These caspases can be divided into either upstream
caspases (also known as initiator or apical caspases) or
downstream caspases (also called effector or distal caspases).
Upstream caspases (-2, -8, -9, -10) are activated following
binding to adaptors (such as FADD or apoptosis associated
factor 1), which promotes self association and autocatalytic
activation. In contrast, downstream caspases (-3, -6, and -7)
lack the ability to self associate and require cleavage by
initiator caspases for their activation. Activated downstream
caspases are responsible for degradation of several cellular
substrates associated with the morphological changes of
apoptosis, including nuclear degradation, cytoskeleton altera￾tions, and membrane blebbing. Other caspases, such as
caspases-1, -4, -5, and -11, are involved in inflammation.24
This concept is important to note in that systemic adminis￾tration of pan-caspase inhibitors also disrupts many inflam￾matory cascades. Therefore, the use of these agents cannot be
solely ascribed to blocking apoptosis. The ability to both
disrupt inflammation and apoptosis however may be
therapeutically very beneficial.
Several intracellular proteins are involved in the regulation
of apoptosis. In particular, the Bcl-2 family of proteins, which
includes both pro- and antiapoptotic members, are perhaps
the most important regulators of the intrinsic pathway. These
proteins act upstream and at the level of the mitochondria to
integrate death and survival signals, and the balance between
pro- and antiapoptotic members of the family, as well as their
reciprocal interactions, determines whether or not the
intrinsic pathway of apoptosis is initiated. To date, the
mammalian Bcl-2 family comprises at least 20 members with
various degrees of homology within four conserved regions,
named Bcl-2 homology (BH) 1–4 domains.25 26 The family can
be further divided into three main subclasses, defined in part
by this homology and in part by their function. The first
subclass includes, among others, the antiapoptotic proteins
Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Mcl-1, which share the highest homology
in all of the four conserved BH 1–4 domains. Their
localisation is generally mitochondrial but some have also
been found on the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear
membrane. The mechanisms by which they prevent mito￾chondrial dysfunction are still largely unclear although they
have been found to directly bind to several proapoptotic
members of the family.27 The second and third subclasses
include only proapoptotic proteins: the so-called multi￾domain Bax-like proteins, such as Bax and Bak, and the
BH3 only proteins, such as Bid, Bad, Bim, Noxa, and Puma.
Both multidomain and BH3 only proteins are required for
apoptosis. In healthy cells, Bax is found in the cytosol as a
monomer, but following an apoptotic stimulus it undergoes
conformation changes, integrates into the outer mitochon￾drial membrane, and oligomerises, causing membrane
permeabilisation28–30 Bak is an oligomeric integral mitochon￾drial membrane protein but it also undergoes conformational
changes during apoptosis and forms larger aggregates.30 31
Following specific death signals, BH3 only proteins are
activated which in turn activate Bax or Bak either by directly
interacting with them32 or by binding to and antagonising the
antiapoptotic members of the family.33 Activation of either
Bax or Bak triggers mitochondrial dysfunction and is
required for apoptosis, but the mechanism(s) through which
mitochondrial permeabilisation is achieved is still debated
(fig 3).34 The BH3 only protein Bid also provides crosstalk
between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Indeed, Bid is
activated by caspase-8 following death receptor engagement
and translocates to the mitochondria where it contributes to
activation of Bax or Bak, and to mitochondrial dysfunction
(fig 2).31 35 36
APOPTOSIS AND LIVER DISEASE
Death receptors, especially Fas, are widely expressed in all
liver cell types, likely in response to the evolutionary pressure
to eliminate hepatotropic viruses.37 The Fas/FasL system is
indeed the pathway most commonly used by immunocytes to
kill virally infected cells.38 Because of this high level of death
receptor expression in hepatocytes, apoptosis in the liver
occurs mainly via the extrinsic pathway (table 1). However,
in both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, mitochondria are
also engaged by the death receptor pathway via activation of
Bid,39 40 and therefore alterations in the intrinsic pathway are
often reported in liver diseases. Based on the above concepts,
we will now explore what is known about apoptotic path￾ways in acute and chronic liver injuries.
Hepatocellular carcinoma
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common
primary malignant tumour of the liver, with a vast incidence
throughout the world. Its pathogenesis is multifactorial, with
a strong aetiological association with chronic viral hepatitis,
alcohol consumption, exposure to hepatic toxins, as well as
some genetic disorders such as haemochromatosis and a1
antitrypsin deficiency. Especially in its promotion stage, HCC
c Apoptosis occurs mainly via a two signalling pathways: a
death receptor mediated extrinsic pathway or a mito￾chondria mediated intrinsic pathway. The pathways are
not mutually exclusive.
c The cysteine proteases caspases are key executors of the
apoptotic programme and are activated by both the
extrinsic and intrinsic pathways; downstream caspases
are directly responsible for degradation of several cellular
components.
c Proteins of the Bcl-2 family are the main regulators of the
intrinsic pathway; they serve as sensors to integrate death
and survival signals at the level of the mitochondria, and
the balance between pro- and antiapoptotic members of
the family, as well as their interactions, determine whether
mitochondria are permeabilised.

has been associated with defective apoptosis and increased
cell proliferation. In particular, tumour cells often show
alterations in expression of tumour suppressor genes, DNA
repair genes, genes regulating the cell cycle, and genes
involved in apoptosis.41
Among the most common alterations frequently observed
in HCC, as well in numerous other tumours, are mutations of
p53.42 43 The protein p53 is the product of a tumour
suppressor gene activated as a result of DNA damage. To
allow the repair of the DNA damage, p53 initially induces cell
cycle arrest. However, if the damage is too extensive to be
repaired and the cell has to be removed, p53 can also induce
apoptosis by transcriptional upregulation of BH3 only
proteins such as Noxa, Puma, and Bid, and/or the multi￾domain protein Bax. p53 can also promote apoptosis by
upregulation of death receptors and death ligands, including
TRAIL-R1, Fas, and FasL.44–46 In addition, a transcriptional
independent mechanism for p53 mediated apoptosis has
been described where it directly associates with and causes
mitochondrial dysfunction.47 Therefore, p53 provide an
effective mechanism to protect the organism from the
accumulation and propagation of genetic lesions. A dysfunc￾tional p53 allows the tumour cell to escape apoptosis and
results in cancer development. In addition, as several
chemotherapeutic drugs induce apoptosis of tumour cells
by causing DNA damage and activation of p53, tumours with
disrupted p53 are generally resistant to chemotherapy and
associated with an unfavourable prognosis. Studies in vitro
and in vivo have demonstrated that adenoviral mediated
expression of wild-type p53 suppresses the transformed
phenotype of many cell types and potentiates the cytotoxicity
of both chemotherapeutic agents and radiation therapy.48
Several phase I and II studies have evaluated the safety,
biological effect, and different routes of administration of
adenoviral mediated p53 gene therapy in various tumour
types, indicating that adenovirus mediated introduction of
wild type p53 into tumour cells represents a potentially
valuable tool for the therapy of many types of human
cancers.49 50 However, only preliminary and not conclusive
results are available to date from p53 gene therapy clinical
trials for HCC.51
Another alteration leading to defective apoptosis that is
frequently observed in several tumours, including HCC, is
downregulation or loss of Fas expression.52 53 Loss of Fas,
often accompanied by expression of FasL, represents an
advantageous adaptation for cancer cells as it enables them
not only to survive the attack carried by FasL expressing

Figure 3 Mitochondria mediated (intrinsic) pathway of apoptosis.
Various stimuli, including ultraviolet (UV) and c-irradiation,
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, growth factor deprivation, and
oxidative stress with production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
trigger the intrinsic pathway via activation of proapoptotic members of
the Bcl-2 family of protein (that is, Bax, Bak), which oligomerise on the
outer mitochondrial membrane and cause mitochondrial dysfunction.
The proapoptotic action of Bax and Bak can be antagonised by the
antiapoptotic members of the same family Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL. Following
mitochondrial dysfunction, several apoptogenic factors, including
cytochrome c and second mitochondria derived activator of caspases/
direct IAP binding protein with low pI (SMAC/DIABLO), are released
from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into the cytosol.
Cytochrome c binds to the adaptor apoptosis associated factor 1
(Apaf-1) and recruits procaspase-9 to form a complex named
apoptosome which, in an APT requiring reaction, results in activation of
the initiator caspase-9. Caspase-9, in turn, activates the effector
caspases (caspase-3, -6, and -7) responsible for degradation of cellular
substrates. SMAC/DIABLO contributes to caspase activation by binding
and inactivating the endogenous inhibitor of caspases IAPs.

cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells, but also to
actively kill the immune cells and create immune privileged
sites.54–56 Several studies have described complete or partial
reduction of Fas expression in HCC, which negatively
correlated with the degree of HCC differentiation and patient
survival.55 57–59 For this reason, levels of Fas expression could
also be used as a marker of dedifferentiation to predict HCC
biological behaviour. However, as activated immune cells can
induce apoptosis not only via engagement of the Fas/FasL
pathway, but also through other death receptors, or via the
perforin/granzyme pathway, downregulation of Fas alone
may not be sufficient to escape the immune response. Indeed,
many HCC have been found to also overexpress the
antiapoptotic protein Bcl-XL, which confers resistance to
mitochondria mediated apoptosis.17 As the death receptor
mediated pathway of apoptosis is strictly linked to the
mitochondrial pathway in hepatocytes, overexpression of
Bcl-XL may contribute to Fas resistance in these tumours.
Therapeutic approaches aimed at restoring Fas expression
and sensitivity to Fas mediated apoptosis in tumour cells may
therefore be proved useful in the therapy of HCC, as well as in
other tumours. Several drugs currently in use for chemother￾apy have been found to upregulate Fas expression via
activation of p53 and increase sensitivity to Fas mediated
apoptosis in tumour cells with wild-type p53.46 60 However,
modulation of other component of the Fas/FasL apoptotic
pathway, such as Bcl-XL, must be considered in designing
new improved chemotherapeutic strategies.
Viral hepatitis
Infection by hepatitis B (HBV) or C virus (HCV), two of the
seven human hepatitis viruses identified so far, is the main
cause for viral hepatitis and represents a worldwide health
problem. These viruses are able to persist in the host for
years, contributing to the onset of chronic hepatitis.
Moreover, because of continuous intrahepatic inflammation
due to persistent infection, liver tissue undergoes a high rate
of cell destruction and regeneration that results in an
increased risk of developing HCC. HBV and HCV triggered
liver injury is mediated mainly by host immune response to
viral proteins expressed by infected hepatocytes and, to a
lesser extent, by direct cytopathic effects of the virus. Indeed,
during viral hepatitis, cytotoxic T lymphocytes recognise and
kill viral antigen expressing HBV or HCV infected hepatocytes
to clear the virus from the liver, causing the initial liver
damage. Subsequently, the influx of antigen non-specific
inflammatory cells exacerbates the tissue damage, with the
formation of necroinflammatory foci. Several studies have
documented that cytotoxic T lymphocytes kill virus infected
hepatocytes by Fas dependent apoptosis, as demonstrated by
enhanced Fas expression and increased number of FasL
positive infiltrating mononuclear cells in the liver of hepatitis
C patients,61–63 and patients with chronic active hepatitis
B,64–66 which correlate with the severity and location of liver
inflammation. Fas expression can be induced either by virus
specific protein expression or by inflammatory cytokines such
as interleukin 1, generated after the first immune response.
Other pathways, including TNF-a and the perforin/granzyme
system, have also been implicated in hepatocyte apoptotic
processes in viral hepatitis.67 68 Caspase activation, triggered
by death ligands, other cytokines, granzyme B, or HCV
proteins, is considerably increased in HCV infected liver, and
correlates closely with the inflammatory response.69 In this
context, it is interesting to note that hepatocytes are resistant
to granzyme B mediated cell death, and cytotoxic T
lymphocytes kill virally infected hepatocytes almost exclu￾sively by the Fas pathway.70 Finally, a recent study has
demonstrated that patients with active HCV, independent of
their alanine aminotransferase values, have elevated levels of
caspase generated cytokeratin 18 cleavage fragments, a
measurement of caspase activation in the liver, compared
with healthy controls.18 These findings are of great clinical
importance as they may have identified a new more sensitive
biomarker for detecting apoptosis mediated liver injury that
could be used both for disease diagnosis and as an end point
for assessing therapies.
The role of the HBV X gene product (HBx) in hepatocyte
apoptosis remains controversial. Studies with transgenic mice
have demonstrated that HBx may stimulate the apoptotic
turnover of hepatocytes.71 In contrast, HBx has also been
reported to stimulate nuclear factor kB (NFkB) or JNK
pathways, which block Fas induced apoptosis in liver
cells.72 73 Similarly, single HCV proteins have been reported
to have both pro- and antiapoptotic effects. Infection with the
hepatitis C core protein increases susceptibility to Fas
mediated apoptosis in a hepatoma cell line although the
mechanism remains unclear and seems not to be due to
increased Fas expression.74 In contrast, multiple HCV proteins
(core, E1, E2, and NS2 proteins) expressed in transgenic mice
have been shown to inhibit Fas mediated apoptosis by
preventing the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria
and activation of caspase-9, -3, and -7.75 Therefore, hepatitis
virus proteins may either sensitise hepatocytes to Fas induced
apoptosis, critically contributing to liver damage, or inhibit
apoptosis, as a possible mechanism to maintain persistent
infection, and promote development of HCC.
In summary, the onset of hepatitis seems to proceed from
an initial non-inflammatory event (apoptosis) to unspecific
necroinflammation. The inflammatory process likely results
from ineffective clearance of the apoptotic bodies by
neighbouring phagocytes whose phagocytic capacity is over￾whelmed by the large number of dying cells. The result is the
release of potentially toxic or immunogenic intracellular
contents, which elicits the inflammatory response and
exacerbates tissue injury, leading to acute or fulminant
hepatitis. In contrast, failure in eliminating infected hepato￾cytes as a result of virus elicited resistance may lead to viral
persistence and promote the development of chronic hepa￾titis. Therefore, a therapeutic approach aimed at modulating
immune cell mediated hepatocyte apoptosis may be appro￾priate to reduce liver damage during viral hepatitis.
Preliminary studies recently showed effective reduction of
liver damage and improvement of survival in mice injected
with small interfering RNA (siRNA) against caspase-8 in
models of acute liver failure (mediated by Fas agonistic
agents) or acute viral hepatitis.76 Moreover, the same siRNA
approach against Fas has been shown to protect mice from

pointed out that although the data are solid and certainly
promising, the applicability of this therapeutic approach to
humans remains to be established. On the other hand, a
nitric oxide derivative of ursodeoxycholic acid, NCX-1000, a

caspase activity. In particular, NCX-1000 protected against T
helper 1 mediated liver injury by inhibiting both the
proapoptotic and proinflammatory branches of the caspase
superfamily, demonstrating that caspase inhibition may be a
valid therapeutic strategy to reduce immune cell mediated
liver damage.78 Finally, phase II trials are currently ongoing to
explore the effect of a pan-caspase inhibitor in HCV patients
unresponsive to approved antiviral agents.
Alcoholic hepatitis
The pathogenesis of alcoholic hepatitis and its degeneration
to alcoholic cirrhosis are poorly understood. Data obtained
from studies employing models of experimental ethanol
induced liver injury have highlighted the crucial role of
apoptosis in this type of liver damage.79 80 However, the
importance of apoptosis in alcoholic liver diseases has only
recently been demonstrated. Hepatocyte apoptosis has been
observed in patients with alcoholic hepatitis, and directly
correlates with disease severity, being most abundant in
patients with high bilirubin and aspartate aminotransferase
levels and grade 4 steatohepatitis.7 81 Apoptotic hepatocytes
often colocalise with infiltrating neutrophils, suggesting an
inflammatory response triggered by apoptosis.81–83 Among the
several mechanisms proposed to explain alcohol induced
hepatocyte apoptosis, induction of CYP2E1, one of the many
cytochrome P450 isoforms, and CYP2E1 dependent formation
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxides, appears
to be one of the possible explanations.84 85 ROS, whose
production is driven by increased availability of the reduced
form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide due to mitochon￾drial acetaldehyde metabolism, may cause mitochondrial
dysfunction and release of proapoptotic factors such as
cytochrome c into the cytosol where they promote caspase
activation. Consistently, antioxidants have been shown to
reduce hepatocyte apoptosis in rats exposed to acute ethanol
intoxication.84 On the other hand, some death receptors and
their ligands, especially Fas/FasL, have been found strongly
expressed in hepatocytes of patients with alcoholic hepatitis
compared with healthy controls or patients with alcoholic
liver disease without hepatitis, which could increase the
sensitivity of cytotoxic T lymphocyte mediated apoptosis.7 86
Hepatocyte apoptosis could also occur by autocrine and/or
paracrine mechanisms, given the fact that both FasL and Fas
are expressed on the same cell. Levels of circulating Fas and
FasL were also found to be raised in patients with severe
alcoholic hepatitis but the sources of these mediators and
their biological importance remains to be investigated.87 The
increase in FasL could be mediated by ROS,88 or may be the
result of TNF-a induced activation of NFkB, which can
upregulate the transcription of both Fas and FasL genes.89
Indeed, TNF-a serum levels are also increased during
alcoholic hepatitis and play a crucial role in mediating
hepatocyte damage.90 Chronic ethanol administration has
also been shown to increase TNF-R expression in hepato￾cytes91 and therefore hepatocytes are likely to be more
susceptible to apoptosis by TNF-a during alcohol exposure.
Apart from a direct cytotoxic effect on the hepatocyte, the
TNF-a/TNF-R1 system seems to be also required for Fas
mediated cell death. Indeed, recent studies demonstrated
that TNF-R1/TNF-R2 double knockout mice, which fail to
undergo TNF-a mediated apoptosis, display increased resis￾tance to Fas induced fulminant liver injury.92 Thus activa￾tion of the TNF-a/TNF-R1 complex may synergise with
Fas mediated signalling to induce hepatocyte apoptosis,
suggesting that both death receptors may contribute to
ethanol mediated liver injury. Therapeutically, several studies
have now been conduced in alcoholic hepatitis employing
anti-TNF-a therapies. These biologicals, antibody therapeu￾tics, appear promising although results are far from
definitive.
Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)
Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) represents a subset of
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), characterised by
the accumulation of fat in the liver (steatosis) along with
inflammation in patients with no history of alcohol con￾sumption or drug use/abuse. NASH can be associated with
fibrosis and can progress to cirrhosis. The cellular mechan￾isms culminating in NASH remain poorly understood and
therefore specific therapies for the treatment of this disease
are still lacking. Recent studies demonstrated that hepatocyte
apoptosis is increased in patients with non-alcoholic steato￾hepatitis, and correlates with disease severity and stage of
fibrosis, suggesting an aetiopathogenic role for apoptosis in
the progression of the disease.93 94 Death receptor expression,
especially Fas and TNF-R1, is also significantly enhanced in
patients with NASH, even more markedly than in alcoholic
hepatitis patients.94 95 Thus NASH may sensitise hepatocytes
to extracellular death ligands (that is, Fas, TNF-a), promot￾ing apoptosis via the extrinsic pathway. Both Fas and TNF
induced hepatocyte apoptosis proceeds via caspase-8 depen￾dent cleavage of Bid, which translocates to mitochondria and
induces mitochondrial dysfunction in cooperation with the
other proapoptotic members Bax or Bak.39 Mitochondrial
dysfunction results in release of cytochrome c, activation of
effector caspases (caspase-3 and -7) and apoptosis.
Consistently, liver samples from NASH patients have been
found to show enhanced Fas expression, activation of
caspase-3 and -7, and apoptosis, which positively correlated
with biochemical and histopathological markers of liver
injury.93–95 In patients with NASH, levels of circulating free
fatty acids (FFA) are elevated and correlate with disease
severity.96 Recent findings showed that treatment of liver
cells in vitro with a mixture of long chain FFA resulted in Bax
translocation to lysosomes and lysosomal destabilisation with
release of lysosomal enzymes into the cytosol, which was, in
part, dependent on a specific lysosomal enzyme, cathepsin
B.97 Lysosomal permeabilisation was also confirmed in liver
specimens from patients with NAFLD, with a positive
correlation with disease severity. Lysosomal destabilisation
resulted in NFkB dependent TNF-a expression, which
promotes triglyceride accumulation and hepatic steatosis.
Moreover, TNF-a can induce further lysosomal destabilisa￾tion and cathepsin B dependent apoptosis in a feed forward
loop that exacerbates liver damage.98 The key role of
cathepsin B in this process is demonstrated by data showing
that, in a dietary murine model of NAFLD, either genetic or
pharmacological inactivation of cathepsin B prevented the
development of hepatic steatosis, liver injury, and insulin
resistance.97 Consistently, genetic or pharmacological inhibi￾tion of cathepsin B has also been shown to reduce hepatocyte
apoptosis and liver damage in steatotic liver after cold
ischaemia/warm reperfusion injury.99 Thus therapeutic
approaches aimed at inhibiting death receptor mediated
apoptosis and/or cathepsin B may prove useful in reducing
liver damage and preventing the development of cirrhosis in
NASH.

Cholestatic liver disease
In cholestatic liver injury, elevated concentrations of bile
acids accumulate in the tissue and within the hepatocytes as
a consequence of reduced bile flow, and trigger liver injury.
Although the mechanisms of liver damage associated with
cholestasis are likely complex and multifactorial, bile acid
mediated hepatotoxicity certainly plays a pivotal role in the
pathogenesis of the disease. Hydrophobic bile acids have been
shown to induce hepatocyte apoptosis in vitro8 100–102 and in
vivo, in animal models of extrahepatic cholestasis.9 103 In
particular, bile acids trigger hepatocyte apoptosis by activat￾ing the death receptor pathway in a ligand independent
manner.8 101 104 Studies in vitro and in vivo have demonstrated
that hepatocyte exposure to toxic bile acids results in ligand
independent oligomerisation of Fas, recruitment of FADD,
activation of caspase-8, and subsequent activation of effector
proteases, including downstream caspases and cathepsin B.
The importance of this pathway is underlined by reports that
hepatocyte apoptosis is decreased in lpr mice, which express
only minimal amounts of Fas, after bile duct ligation (an
experimental model of extrahepatic cholestasis).9 The
mechanism triggering Fas oligomerisation independent of
FasL, however, is still unclear. Pathophysiological concentra￾tions of conjugated bile acids have been shown to induce
apoptosis only in cells expressing a bile acid transporter.105
Therefore, bile acids are likely to trigger receptor oligomer￾isation from inside the cell. In agreement with this
hypothesis, elevated bile acid concentrations within the
hepatocyte have been found to induce Fas translocation
from its intracellular locations to the plasma membrane,
where the increased surface density likely triggers its
oligomerisation.100
Although Fas certainly plays a crucial role in bile acid
mediated cytotoxicity, other death receptor pathways are also
likely to be involved. The absence of functional Fas, indeed,
seems to confer only transient protection, as suggested by the
increase in apoptosis in lpr mice under conditions of
persistent cholestasis.9 Studies on Fas deficient cells have
demonstrated that at least one of these pathways involves
transcriptional induction and oligomerisation of another
death receptor, TRAIL-R2 (also called death receptor 5,
DR5), suggesting other death receptor can functionally
replace Fas in its absence.101 Because both Fas and
TRAIL-R2 oligomerisation results in activation of caspase￾8/-10 and Bid cleavage, targeted inhibition of caspases or Bid
could be therapeutically useful in the treatment of cholestatic
liver diseases. Consistently, experimental inhibition of Bid by
injection of antisense oligonucleotides has been shown to
reduce hepatocyte apoptosis and liver damage in bile duct
ligated mice.103 Moreover, the pan-caspase inhibitor
IDN-6556 has been found to be effective in attenuating liver
injury and fibrosis in bile duct ligated mice.106 The drug is
currently in clinical trial for treatment of various liver
diseases.107
Hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis
Fibrogenesis is a relatively late event in chronic liver injury,
and occurs as a consequence of activation of hepatic stellate
cells (HSC) and excessive deposition of extracellular matrix,
under conditions of persistent inflammation. The first phase
of liver injury, however, independent of the aetiology, is
almost always characterised by increased hepatocyte
apoptosis. Because for many years apoptosis has been
considered a mechanism of cell death not associated with
an inflammatory response, the two phases in the develop￾ment of the disease have never been connected. It is only
recently that a link between these two pathological events
has been established.108 Recent studies have demonstrated
that hepatic fibrosis was significantly reduced in a model of
experimental extrahepatic cholestasis when Fas mediated
apoptosis was impaired, or when caspases or cathepsin B, a
lysosomal enzyme involved in bile acid induced apoptosis,
were inhibited.10 106 109 Conversely, persistent hepatocyte
apoptosis due to hepatocyte specific disruption of Bcl-XL
has been shown to lead to liver fibrosis with advanced age.110
This latter model is highly illustrative because it directly
demonstrates that hepatocyte apoptosis is profibrogenic.
Apoptosis is indeed a proinflammatory process when
occurs in pathological conditions. In the presence of massive
hepatocyte apoptosis, the ability of phagocytic cells to
effectively and rapidly remove dead cells in tissue is
overwhelmed, with accumulation and subsequent autolysis
of the apoptotic bodies, and release of their proinflammatory
contents. Moreover, engulfment of apoptotic bodies by
Kupffer cells, the major phagocytes in the liver, has been
demonstrated to enhance expression of death ligands,
especially Fas ligand and the proinflammatory cytokine
TNF-a, thereby accelerating hepatocyte apoptosis and
eliciting hepatic inflammation.111 Phagocytosis of apoptotic
bodies also promotes generation of transforming growth
factor b (TGF-b), a cytokine with potent profibrogenic and

Figure 4 The link between apoptosis and fibrosis in the liver.
Schematic representation of the molecular mechanisms involved in the
proposed model linking hepatocyte apoptosis and liver fibrosis.
Different injuries on the liver result in hepatocyte apoptosis. The
generated apoptotic bodies are cleared by phagocytosis by Kupffer
cells and hepatic stellate cells, which enhances their expression of
profibrogenic genes and death ligands, such as Fas ligand. Persistent
activation of these cells promotes further hepatocyte apoptosis,
progression of fibrosis, hepatic inflammation, and liver damage.

proapoptotic activity in the liver.110 112 113 Although their
capacity to engulf apoptotic bodies is lower than Kupffer
cells, HSC are anatomically better positioned to engulf
apoptotic bodies from dying hepatocytes than Kupffer cells,
and have been shown to clear apoptotic bodies in vitro.114
More importantly, this process is associated with activation
of quiescent HSC, as demonstrated by induction of the classic
marker a-smooth muscle actin, and increase production of
TGF-b1 and collagen Ia, both markers of fibrogenic activity.114
More data however are required to ascertain the occurrence
of the process in vivo. Thus it appears that engulfment of
apoptotic bodies by both Kupffer cells and HSC promotes
their expression of profibrogenic proteins and death ligands.
Persistent activation of these cells results in exacerbation of
hepatocyte apoptosis, hepatic inflammation, sustained HSC
activation, and progression to liver cirrhosis (fig 4).
Therefore, purposeful induction of apoptosis of activated
HSC may be a useful antifibrotic therapy. As activated HSC
have been found to express preferentially TRAIL-R2 and
show increased sensitivity to TRAIL mediated apoptosis,115
whereas TRAIL-R2 is not expressed on hepatocytes, induction
of apoptosis via treatment with a TRAIL-R2 agonist antibody
might represent an ideal therapeutic strategy to selectively
kill HSC. Inhibition of apoptotic body engulfment by HSC, or
modulation of signalling events occurring in HSC as a result
of phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies, also appear to be
potentially valid therapeutic strategies to inhibit liver
fibrogenesis.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUDING REMARKS
Apoptosis represents the physiological way to eliminate
excessive cells during embryogenesis and tissue remodelling.
Under these conditions, apoptosis occurs in a controlled
environment where dying cells are promptly removed by
phagocytosis and replaced by new cells generated by mitosis.
Apoptosis, however, is also an essential feature of a wide
variety of acute and chronic diseases, including liver diseases.
Imbalance between cell proliferation and death always leads
to loss of tissue homeostasis and onset of various diseases.
Excessive apoptosis has, indeed, been identified in acute and
chronic viral hepatitis, alcoholic and non-alcoholic hepatitis,
cholestatic liver disease, Wilson’s disease, and graft versus
host disease (GVHD). Sustained apoptosis has also been
linked with the development of hepatic fibrosis. In contrast,
insufficient apoptosis has been associated with development
and progression of tumours of the liver and the biliary tree.
Thus identification of target molecules involved in apoptosis
may offer new options for pharmacological and/or gene
mediated therapies for patients with liver diseases (fig 5).

Figure 5 Therapeutic modulation of apoptosis in liver diseases. Imbalance between cell proliferation and cell death in the liver contributes to the
pathogenesis of several liver diseases. Excessive apoptosis is associated with acute diseases, such as acute and fulminant hepatitis, as well as with
chronic diseases, such as chronic hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, cholestatic liver disease, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Sustained
apoptosis also causes persistent inflammation and promotes fibrogenesis. In contrast, deficient apoptosis contributes to the development of liver and
biliary cancer. Therapeutic strategies currently in use or potentially useful to modulate apoptosis in liver diseases are depicted. TRAIL, tumour necrosis
