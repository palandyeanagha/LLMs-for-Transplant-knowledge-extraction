Abstract
Background: The clinical value of LVRS has been questioned in the
absence of trials comparing it with pulmonary rehabilitation, the
prevailing standard of care in COPD. Patients with heterogeneous
emphysema are more likely to benefit from volume reduction than
those with homogeneous disease. Disease specific quality of life is a
responsive interpretable outcome that enables health professionals
to identify the magnitude of the effect of an intervention across
several domains.
Methods: Non-smoking patients aged <75 years with severe COPD
(FEV1 <40% predicted, FEV1/FVC <0.7), hyperinflation, and
evidence of heterogeneity were randomised to surgical or control
groups after pulmonary rehabilitation and monitored at 3 month
intervals for 12 months with no crossover between the groups. The
primary outcome was disease specific quality of life as measured by
the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ). Treatment failure
was defined as death or functional decline (fall of 1 unit in any two
domains of the CRQ). Secondary outcomes included pulmonary
function and exercise capacity.
Results: LVRS resulted in significant between group differences in


each domain of the CRQ at 12 months (change of 0.5 represents a
small but important difference): dyspnoea 1.9 (95% confidence
interval (CI) 1.3 to 2.6; p<0.0001); emotional function 1.5 (95% CI
0.9 to 2.1; p<0.0001); fatigue 2.0 (95% CI 1.4 to 2.6; p<0.0001);
mastery 1.8 (95% CI 1.2 to 2.5; p<0.0001). In the control group
one of 27 patients died and 16 experienced functional decline over
12 months. In the surgical group four of 28 patients died and three
experienced functional decline (hazard ratio = 3.1 (95% CI 1.3 to
7.6; p=0.01). Between group improvements (p<0.05) in lung
volumes, flow rates, and exercise were sustained at 12 months (RV
−47% predicted (95% CI −71 to −23; p=0.0002); FEV1 0.3 l
(95% CI 0.1 to 0. 5; p=0.0003); submaximal exercise 7.3 min (95%
CI 3.9 to 10.8; p<0.0001); 6 minute walk 66 metres (95% CI 32 to
101; p=0.0002).
Conclusions: In COPD patients with heterogeneous emphysema,
LVRS resulted in important benefits in disease specific quality of life
compared with medical management, which were sustained at 12
months after treatment.
