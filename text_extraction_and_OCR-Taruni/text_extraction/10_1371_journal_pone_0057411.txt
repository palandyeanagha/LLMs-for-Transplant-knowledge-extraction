Abstract
Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, a consequence of kidney hypoperfusion or temporary interruption of blood flow is
a common cause of acute kidney injury (AKI). There is an unmet need to better understand the mechanisms operative
during the initial phase of ischemic AKI. Non-invasive in vivo parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may elucidate
spatio-temporal pathophysiological changes in the kidney by monitoring the MR relaxation parameters T2* and T2, which
are known to be sensitive to blood oxygenation. The aim of our study was to establish the technical feasibility of fast
continuous T2*/T2 mapping throughout renal I/R. MRI was combined with a remotely controlled I/R model and
a segmentation model based semi-automated quantitative analysis. This technique enabled the detailed assessment of
in vivo changes in all kidney regions during ischemia and early reperfusion. Significant changes in T2* and T2 were observed
shortly after induction of renal ischemia and during the initial reperfusion phase. Our study demonstrated for the first time
that continuous and high temporal resolution parametric MRI is feasible for in-vivo monitoring and characterization of I/R
induced AKI in rats. This technique may help in the identification of the timeline of key events responsible for development
of renal damage in hypoperfusion-induced AKI.

Introduction
Acute kidney injury (AKI) can be caused by kidney hypoperfu￾sion or temporary interruption of blood flow in various clinical
settings [1–3]. This ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/RI) is charac￾terized by mismatch of local tissue oxygen supply and local cellular
energy demand and results in sublethal or lethal injuries to the
tubular epithelium and neighbouring cell structures which is
clinically detected as compromised glomerular filtration rate [4,5].
Despite substantial progress in the field of AKI including
biomarker discovery and renal replacement therapy dosing, there
is an unmet need to better understand the mechanisms operative
during the initial phase of ischemic AKI. Treatments targeting
processes operative before the onset of sublethal or lethal cellular
injuries would have great clinical impact. Animal models are well
suited to study mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of renal
ischemia/reperfusion injury and helped to define the injury phases
of initiation, extension and regeneration [6–8]. The imbalance
between oxygen demand and supply is considered to be the
initiating step in the pathophysiologic cascade of events [9–11].
Renal tissue oxygen tension (pO2) as determined by invasive in-vivo
measurements in the first hour after reperfusion may be decisive
for renal damage at 48 hours [12,13]. However, lack of adequate
diagnostic tools capable to determine spatio-temporal distribution
of oxygenation during the phases of renal ischemia/reperfusion
precluded elucidation of events taking place immediately after
initiation of ischemia and reperfusion.
Non-invasive in vivo imaging holds the promise to elucidate
spatio-temporal pathophysiological changes in the kidney by
monitoring the early phases of ischemia and reperfusion. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) meets the needs of non-invasive renal in￾vivo imaging. Parametric MRI can provide maps of the MR
relaxation parameters T2* and T2, which are known to be blood
oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) [13]. The BOLD effect
relies on the paramagnetic property of deoxygenated hemoglobin.
A signal attenuation in T2*-weighted MR images occurs if the
volume fraction of deoxygenated hemoglobin increases. T2* or its
reciprocal value (R2* = 1/T2*) have been used in numerous
clinical and preclinical studies as a surrogate of renal (blood)
oxygenation [14]. Renal R2* has even been suggested to display
a close correlation with renal tissue pO2 levels [15], and R2*-
mapping has been deemed ideally suited for the evaluation of

intra-renal oxygenation [14]. The full potential of BOLD MRI
and T2*/T2 mapping remained as yet untapped [16–20]. Few
rodent studies performed so far include preliminary reports about
T2*/T2 measurements in renal ischemia models [21–23], chronic
renal artery stenosis in rats [16] and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in
mice [20]. Due to technical limitations, none of these studies
focused on high temporal resolution continuous parametric MRI
based in-vivo monitoring during ischemia – and in particular
during early reperfusion of the kidney. We sought to establish the
feasibility high temporal resolution longitudinal T2*/T2 mapping
throughout I/R. To meet this goal an I/R model that affords
remote induction of ischemia/reperfusion inside an MR scanner is
implemented together with a standardized segmentation model of
the rat kidney. This integrated approach enabled for the first time
the monitoring of renal T2* and T2 in the initial reperfusion phase.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the
guidelines provided and approved by the Animal Welfare
Department of the Landesamt fu¨r Gesundheit und Soziales Berlin
(Berlin State Office of Health and Social Affairs, permit numbers
G00121/11, G0059/12). All experiments were carried out under
urethane anesthesia (20% in saline, 6 ml/kg body mass, intra￾peritoneal), and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.
Animals were kept under constant thermal conditions: 37uC body
temperature was maintained by warming the animal beds using
a circulating heated water system (Thermo Haake GmbH,
Karlsruhe, Germany). Rectal temperature and respiratory mo￾tion/rate were monitored (SA Instruments, Inc., New York, USA)
throughout the imaging experiments.
MR Imaging
All imaging experiments were carried out on a 9.4T small
animal MR system (Biospec 94/20, Bruker Biospin, Ettlingen,
Germany) equipped with a linear polarized birdcage RF resonator
for transmission in conjunction with a curved four channel receive
RF coil array (Bruker Biospin, Ettlingen, Germany) customized for
rats.
MRI protocols for parametric mapping of T2* and T2 were
tailored for fast measurements in the rat kidney at a magnetic field
strength of 9.4 Tesla. T2-weighted pilot scans and local B0
shimming that uses a voxel enclosing the kidney only were
performed first. Subsequently, parametric T2* and T2 mapping
using respiratory gated imaging techniques was performed. For
T2* mapping a multi gradient echo (MGE) sequence (repetition
time = 50 ms, echo times = 10, first echo time = 1.43 ms, echo
spacing 2.14 ms, averages = 4) was employed with a total acqui￾sition time of approx. 1 min 20 s (respiratory rate dependent). For
T2 mapping a multi spin echo (MSME) sequence (repetition
time = 550 ms, echo times = 7, first echo time = 10 ms, echo
spacing 10 ms, averages = 1) was used with a total acquisition
time of approx. 1 min 40 s. A coronal oblique image slice was
acquired with a spatial in plane resolution of (2266445) mm2 (field
of view = (38.2650.3) mm2
, matrix size = 1696113 zero-filled to
1696215) and a slice thickness of 1.4–1.5 mm.
Renal blood flow during I/R experiments was monitored by
time-of-flight (TOF) MR angiographies of the kidney. TOF
angiography consisted of an untriggered spoiled gradient echo
sequence (2D FLASH, repetition time = 11 ms, echo time = 3 ms,
flip angle = 80 degree, spatial in plane resolution of (2006268)
mm2
) with 15 slices of 1.0 mm thickness placed perpendicular to
the major renal blood vessels, acquired in 24 seconds.
Image Analysis and Kidney Segmentation Model
Parametric maps of absolute T2* and T2 values were calculated
by pixel-wise mono-exponential fitting to the signal intensities of
the T2*- and T2-weighted images acquired at different echo times
(in-house developed program; MATLAB, R2010a, MathWorks,
Natick, WA, USA). The relaxation times T2* and T2 were chosen
over the relaxivities (i.e. R2* = 1/T2* and R2= 1/T2), as they
allow for a better visualization of changes in the parameter maps
for the different kidney regions and stimuli. In quantitative data
representations such as value tables or bar charts the relaxation
times are complemented by the corresponding relativities, which
were also derived on a pixel-by-pixel basis.
Movements of the kidney during I/R experiments were
compensated by image registration (FLIRT, FSL, www.fmrib.ox.
ac.uk/fsl) using the first echo images of the multi-echo MGE or
MSME acquisitions. Images were registered onto a baseline scan
and the resulting spatial transformation matrices applied to the
corresponding parameter maps.
Mean T2* (R2*) and T2 (R2) values for several regions-of￾interest (ROI) within the renal cortex, outer medulla and inner
medulla were calculated from the parameter maps. To reduce
operator-induced variability in the ROI placement a standardized
segmentation model of the rat kidney was developed. For this
purpose special care was taken with regard to the location of the
ROIs in the kidney. The aim was to determine ROIs strictly
according to morphological kidney features, i.e., the distinct renal
layers: cortex, outer medulla, and inner medulla (Figure 1). To this
end, the dimensions of the rat kidney layers were measured in
a series of freshly harvested kidneys as well as in a series of
formalin-fixed kidneys (altogether 16 kidneys). To account for the
inter-individual variability of the absolute length (cranial to caudal
extremities) and width (lateral to medial border) of the kidneys,
a rectangular frame that tightly encloses the kidney in the coronal
view was used as a reference. The segmentation model consists of
nine ROIs at defined relative positions (percentages of both
diameters) within this rectangular reference frame (Figure 1). The
size and positions of nine ROIs were defined for three ROIs in the
renal cortex (COR), for three ROIs in the outer medulla (OM),
and for three ROIs in the inner medulla (IM). All ROIs were
placed in safe distance from the borders between these kidney
layers to avoid any ‘contamination’ from the neighboring layers
(partial segment effects) and to allow for inter-individual variations
in morphology without the need to change the ROI position. The
implementation of this model in a semi-automated analysis
program developed in ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA,
http://imagej.nih.gov/ij) limited user interaction to the placement
of the rectangular reference frame around the kidney. The
automatically placed ROIs were overlaid onto the parameter maps
and their position was visually validated. ROIs that included
artifacts were excluded from further analysis.
Due to the need for respiratory triggering the time intervals
between MRI scans (,180 seconds) varied slightly during the
imaging experiments and between animals. To allow for
a comparison between different animals the acquired T2* time
courses were linearly interpolated and T2* calculated for time
points at exact intervals of 180 seconds. Group mean values and
standard errors of the mean (SEM) were then calculated for each
time point and T2* (mean 6SEM averaged over six animals)
plotted versus time. In all other cases (e.g. bar charts of parameter
values at end-baseline, end-ischemia, etc) the original, non￾interpolated, data were used.

Hypoxia and Hyperoxia Experiments
Renal T2* and T2 mapping at 9.4 Tesla in rats under variable
physiological conditions has not been reported so far. Hence, the
sensitivity of T2* and T2 to renal blood oxygenation changes was
demonstrated by examining the changes induced in these
parameters by externally controlled variations of blood oxygena￾tion. Blood oxygenation level changes (hypoxia or hyperoxia) were
induced in six male rats (Wistar, aged 3–4 month, 300–350 g body
weight) by adapting the inhaled gas composition.
Experimental protocol. A respiratory mask was used, which
provided air (normoxia) at a flow rate of 1000 ml/min. Following
baseline measurements of T2*/T2, hypoxia was induced by
adjusting the gas mixture to 10/90% O2/N2. T2*/T2 measure￾ments were conducted throughout 8 minutes after induction of
hypoxia. The final T2*/T2 scans during hypoxia were started
exactly 5 minutes after hypoxia onset, to ensure equal hypoxia
durations and comparable timing of the MR scans. On completion
of these MR scans, inhaled gas mixture was changed back to air
and T2*/T2 continuously monitored for another ,9 minutes. The
same protocol was followed for the hyperoxia experiments by
setting the inhaled gas to 100% O2. Figure 2 illustrates the
experimental procedure, by showing the timeline and the
corresponding T2*-weighted MR images together with calculated
T2* parameter maps acquired prior, during and after hypoxia/
hyperoxia.
Ischemia/Reperfusion Experiments
Six male rats (Lewis, aged 2–3 months, 250–300 g body weight)
underwent experimental ischemia-reperfusion inside the MR
scanner.
Preparation. The abdominal cavity was opened by a mid￾ventral incision and the right kidney was removed. A remote
controlled hydraulic occluder was placed around the renal artery
and vein of the remaining left kidney to allow induction of renal
ischemia. The hydraulic occluder (Figure 3) consists of a distensible
silicone tube that is connected to a syringe via an indistensible
extension tube. A suture loop around the distensible tube and
renal vein and artery leads to a compression of the artery and vein
when the distensible tube is inflated hydraulically. For intra￾arterial administration of a vehicle solutions (to be replaced by
drugs in future studies) to the kidney a catheter was placed in the
aorta with its tip directly at the renal branch. A second remote
controlled hydraulic occluder was placed just below the renal
branch around the aorta. With the purpose of monitoring the
temperature of the kidney throughout the imaging experiment,
a fiber-optic temperature probe (OTP-M, AccuSens, Opsens,
Quebec City, Canada) was positioned in close proximity to the
kidney. The abdominal cavity was then filled with warmed saline
and closed by sutures.
Experimental protocol. Directly following surgery the
animal was transferred to the warmed MRI animal bed. For the
remainder of the experiment T2* and T2 were continuously
monitored by interleaved T2*/T2 mapping with a temporal
resolution of ,3 minutes. After a baseline of five T2*/T2
measurements the hydraulic occluder around the aorta was
temporarily closed and a vehicle (100 ml of saline containing 1%
DMSO) administered. Thereafter, ischemia was induced by
closing the hydraulic occluder around the renal artery and vein
for 45 minutes, followed by a reperfusion phase of ,100 minutes.
Renal blood flow during the three phases of the I/R experiment
was monitored by time-of-flight (TOF) MR angiographies of the
kidney, acquired prior and immediately after ischemia induction,
as well as after onset of reperfusion. The absence of the flow￾dependent intra-vascular signal during ischemia served to confirm
complete occlusion of the renal artery and vein. Figure 4 illustrates
the experimental procedure, by showing the timeline and the
corresponding T2*-weighted and T2-weighted MR images for six
time points, together with T2* and T2 parameter maps.

Statistical Analysis
T2* and T2 derived from the nine kidney ROIs were statistically
analyzed using SPSS (version 20, IBM Deutschland GmbH,
Germany). Data are expressed as mean6SEM. Normal distribu￾tion was confirmed by a one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
Tests of significance (2-tailed t-test) were performed for the last
time points in each experimental phase (baseline, ischemia,
reperfusion) following Levene’s test for equality of variances. A
probability value of #0.05 was considered significant.
Results
Changes in renal T2*, T2 were explored during variations of
inspiratory gas composition (hypoxia, hyperoxia) and during renal
ischemia/reperfusion.
Hypoxia and Hyperoxia Experiments
The variations in inspiratory gas composition demonstrated
a high sensitivity of T2* and T2 to renal blood oxygenation
changes. Parametric mapping revealed a decrease in T2* and T2
for hypoxia and an increase for hyperoxia in all kidney layers
(Fig. 2). For quantitative examination of T2* and T2 changes,
mean values were determined for nine regions-of-interest (ROI)
according to the proposed standardized renal segmentation model.
Under hypoxic conditions T2* decreased by 35–49% (COR), 53–
62% (OM), and 53–64% (IM), while T2 decreased by 25–29%
(COR), 29–33% (OM), and 29–31% (IM). The observed increase

air to 10%/90% O2/N2 or 100% O2. T2*/T2 measurements were repeated directly after and exactly 5 minutes after onset of hypoxia/hyperoxia (to
ensure equal timing of the MR scans). Subsequently inhaled gas was changed back to air and T2*/T2 monitored continuously for another ,9 minutes.

(IM) for T2* and 3–8% (COR), 11–20% (OM), 11–16% (IM) for
T2.
Ischemia/Reperfusion Experiments
T2* and T2 were monitored before and during ischemia/
reperfusion with a temporal resolution of ,3 minutes. Figure 4
shows T2*-weighted and T2-weighted MR images for six time
points, together with T2* and T2 parameter maps. The six time
points represent last baseline, onset of ischemia and end of
ischemia after 45 minutes, onset of reperfusion, and 12 minutes
and 100 minutes after onset of reperfusion. T2* and T2 parameter
maps of an entire ischemia reperfusion experiment are presented
in Figures S1 and S2. These parametric maps demonstrated
immediate changes in T2*/T2 after onset and end of ischemia.
Quantitative examination of T2* and T2 changes used the
standardized renal segmentation model. Plots of T2* (mean
6SEM averaged over six animals) versus time for these ROIs
are shown in Figure 5. The T2* time courses revealed an immediate
drop in T2* after onset of ischemia followed by a slow and steady
decrease in T2*. During ischemia T2* was significantly reduced in
all ROIs (p#0.01 in C1, p#0.001 in all other ROIs), which clearly
distinguished this condition from baseline. The time courses of T2
were very similar to those of T2*. During reperfusion, T2* and T2
did return to baseline in the cortex, but not in the medulla. While
no major differences among the cortical, outer medullary, and
inner medullary T2* changes were found during ischemia, there
was a clear regional dynamics during reperfusion. After onset of
reperfusion T2* returned close to baseline for cortical segments
(p = 0.97 (C1), p = 0.22 (C2), p = 0.65 (C3)). For the outer medulla
T2* remained below baseline throughout reperfusion and was at
40–47% below baseline after 100 minutes (p#0.05 (C1), p#0.001
(C2), p#0.01 (C3)). T2 was 19–21% below baseline at 100 minutes
reperfusion. In the inner medulla T2* and T2 exceeded baseline by
17–28% and 14–18% respectively (non-significant) at the end of
reperfusion. These differences among the layers were pronounced
during early reperfusion and remained stable throughout reperfu￾sion. The assessment of the heterogeneity among segments within
one kidney layer revealed an almost equal time course in T2* for
the cortical, outer medullary and inner medullary segments,
respectively.

were repeated continuously throughout the entire experiment (55 time points). Images and maps are shown for six time points: last baseline, onset
of ischemia and end of ischemia after 45 minutes, onset of reperfusion, and 12 minutes and 100 minutes after onset of reperfusion. All parameter
maps are shown in Figure S2.

Comparison of Hypoxia/Hyperoxia and Ischemia/
Reperfusion
Changes in renal T2* and T2 during hypoxia, hyperoxia,
ischemia and reperfusion are illustrated in Figure 6 by T2* and T2
difference maps. Hypoxia/hyperoxia led to a rather uniform T2*/
T2 reduction/rise across the kidney. The T2*/T2 reduction in
ischemic kidneys exceeded that during hypoxia. Changes in the
course of reperfusion clearly differentiated cortex and medulla. In
accordance with the ROI data medullary T2*/T2 remained
reduced throughout reperfusion, cortical T2* returned to baseline
and cortical T2 even rose markedly above baseline.
For a quantitative synopsis of the ischemia-reperfusion results
together with the hypoxia/hyperoxia results the MR parameter
values at baseline, end-hypoxia/hyperoxia, end-ischemia and end￾reperfusion were chosen. The group mean T2* and T2 with
standard errors (SEM) are surveyed for all regions-of-interest in
Table S1, together with the corresponding relativities R2* and R2.
Relative changes in these parameters are summarized in Figure 7.
DT2* (DR2*) and DT2 (DR2) derived from the outer/inner medulla
exceeded those observed in the cortex (except for DT2 (DR2)
during reperfusion). For all regions the T2* (R2*) changes during
ischemia were more pronounced than during hypoxia. T2 (R2)
effects during ischemia were comparable to hypoxia.
Figure 5. Ischemia reperfusion results derived from the standardized segmentation model of the kidney: Plots of T2* (mean 6SEM
averaged over six animals) versus time for the ROIs in the cortex (C1, C2, C3; top row), in the outer medulla (O1, O2, O3; middle
row), and in the inner medulla (I1, I2, I3; bottom row). Ischemia (shaded in gray) led to an immediate and significant T2* decrease in all kidney
ROIs (p#0.01 in C1, p#0.001 in all other ROIs). Clear differences between cortex, outer medulla and inner medulla were observed. At the end of the
reperfusion period T2* was close to baseline (dashed line) in the cortex (p.0.2), below baseline in the outer medulla (p#0.05 (C1), p#0.001 (C2),
p#0.01 (C3)), and above baseline in the inner medulla (non-significant). The three ROIs within each kidney regions showed very similar but not
identical trends.

Discussion
Our study demonstrates that continuous and high temporal
resolution parametric MRI is feasible for in-vivo monitoring and
characterization of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) induced AKI in
rats. Fast T2*/T2 mapping was combined with a remotely
controlled I/R model and a segmentation model based semi￾automated quantitative analysis. This approach allowed tracking
of T2*/T2 in the kidney during I/R with a high spatial and
temporal resolution. Our study provides a technical advance in the
field, as only snapshot images acquired before and after induction
of injury were previously analyzed in I/R models [16–20].
The proposed segmentation model of the rat kidney served to
reduce operator-induced variability compared to manually drawn
regions-of-interest used in similar studies [16–19]. Taking into
account that the histological borders among the kidney layers are
rather undulating, extra care was taken to leave a generous
spacing between the ROIs in the cortex and the outer medulla,
and between the ROIs in the outer and the inner medulla to avoid
partial segment effects. Thus, parametric MRI data of these ROIs
can be attributed exactly to the respective morphological layer.
T2* and T2 changes were observed for all kidney regions shortly
after induction of renal ischemia and during the initial reperfusion
phase, which remained stable throughout the monitored reperfu￾sion period. These findings could help to support the hypothesis
that key events for the initiation of injury occur immediately after
reperfusion, if a link to observations at later time points (e.g. 6–48
hours) can be established in future studies. In this study the
surgical/experimental procedures were adapted for performing
in vivo I/R experiments inside of an MR scanner; they do not allow
for a recovery of the animal and additional MRI at later time
points.
Considering the oxygenation-sensitivity of T2* (R2*) measure￾ments during hypoxia, the immediate decline of T2* at the onset of
ischemia, and the accordance with reports on invasively measured
tissue pO2 during ischemia [12], it is reasonable to attribute the
detected T2* (R2*) changes primarily to variations in intrarenal
blood oxygenation. Still, T2* and T2 may only be surrogates for
physiological parameters of interest, such as renal blood oxygen￾ation. The influence of numerous other physical and physiological
parameters on T2*/T2 variations in vivo, and in particular on the
absolute values of these parameters, must be taken into account
when comparing parametric MRI data with other quantitative
measures of blood (or even tissue) oxygenation. For this reason it is
conceptually appealing for future studies to combining invasive
techniques and non-invasive MRI in a hybrid setup with the goal
to calibrate, monitor and interpret parametric MR and physio￾logical parameters by means of standardized interventions.
Absolute values of baseline renal R2* were found to be lower in
the inner medulla versus outer medulla and cortex, which is in
agreement with previous reports [16,24,25]. This finding does not
correspond with tissue pO2 levels measured by invasive methods
[26], which showed the lowest pO2 levels in the inner medulla.
One reason behind what seems to be a discrepancy is that the
blood oxygenation dependence of R2* (T2*) does not relate to the
deoxyhemoglobin/oxyhemoglobin ratio, but to the absolute
amount of deoxyhemoglobin per tissue volume. Thus, besides
being dependent on blood oxygenation, R2* (T2*) is influenced by
the blood vessel volume fraction and the hematocrit. Both, vessel
volume fraction and hematocrit are low in the inner medulla
[27,28].
In our study complete occlusion of the renal artery and vein
were confirmed by MR angiography, rendering potentially
confounding changes in global renal blood volume unlikely.
Two possibly involved physiological factors are alterations in pH
and fluid shifts. A significant drop in pH during renal artery
occlusion in rats has been reported earlier [22]. By altering the
hemoglobin oxygen saturation curve a pH reduction significantly
influences the blood oxygenation effect on T2* [14]. To this end,
simultaneous MRI mapping and conventional invasive measure￾ments of oxygenation may allow further insights.
During hypoxia and ischemia MRI revealed significantly higher
R2* indicating lower renal oxygenation. The observed increases in
Figure 6. Change of renal T2* and T2 during hypoxia, hyperoxia, ischemia and reperfusion. Shown are T2* and T2 difference maps of the
kidney (color-coded, overlay on anatomical MR image) between the last time point in each experiment phase and baseline. The three interventions
(hypoxia, hyperoxia, ischemia) led to a reasonably homogeneous decrease/increase in both parameters. During ischemia the magnitude of the T2*/T2
reduction exceeded that during hypoxia. Parameter changes in the reperfusion phase clearly differentiated cortex and medulla: while medullary T2*/
T2 remained reduced throughout reperfusion, in the cortex T2* returned to baseline and T2 rose above baseline.

R2* during ischemia (180–500% of baseline) are comparable with
previous reports [20] considering the difference in species (rat
versus mouse model), magnetic field strength and analyses
techniques. Parametric MRI monitoring, as established in our
study, overcomes the limitations of snapshot data acquisitions at
a few time points only and greatly enhances the assessment of
spatio-temporal evolution of MR biomarkers – particularly in the
initial reperfusion phase.
Our findings regarding R2* during I/R show similarities to
invasively measured medullary pO2 time courses previously
reported [12] and reflect impaired reoxygenation and hypoperfu￾sion in the outer medulla after reperfusion which is related to the
so-called ‘‘no reflow’’ phenomenon [29]. Parametric MRI in￾dicated a strong persistent hypoxia in the outer medulla during
reperfusion. The outer medulla is particularly susceptible to an
ischemic insult due to high cellular metabolic rate (S3 segment of
the proximal tubules, thick ascending limbs of Henle’s loop) is high
and marked hypoperfusion and congestion persist during reperfu￾sion, i.e. in the extension phase of AKI [30]. The R2* effects of
hyperoxia on renal oxygenation were much smaller compared to
hypoxia, which might be due to the already high arterial oxygen
saturation of hemoglobin during normoxia. The amount of oxygen
not bound to hemoglobin but dissolved in blood, which is expected
to increase during hyperoxia, contributes only a rather small
fraction to the overall oxygen supply.
Interleaved mapping of T2* and T2 may provide complemen￾tary information about the (patho)physiological conditions in the
kidney as both MR parameters are affected by changes in blood
oxygenation and water content to different degrees. Variations in
the volume fraction of deoxygenated hemoglobin impact on the
MR signal stemming from intra-vascular spaces of large vessels or
capillaries as well as regions around these vessels. These intra- and
extra-vascular signal components contribute differently to T2* and
T2 [31,32] and T2 is sensitive to water content [33]. Hence
mapping of both parameters could allow for a more comprehen￾sive assessment of renal oxygenation changes. The strong T2* and
T2, changes observed in this study will inspire further explorations
into MR methodology suitable for simultaneous T2*/T2 mapping.
In conclusion, continuous parametric MR monitoring of T2*
and T2 throughout an I/R experiment in rats is feasible and

provides a temporal resolution of approximately 80–100 seconds
for each read-out resulting in 3 minutes for alternating T2*/T2
measurements. The proposed MRI approach enables the detailed
assessment of in vivo changes in all kidney regions during ischemia
and early reperfusion. Observations in the early reperfusion phase
promise to offer new insights into the pathogenesis of ischemia
induced AKI and might help to identify the timeline of key events
responsible for development of hypoperfusion-induced renal
damage. The established method of parametric MR monitoring
holds the promise to be a useful investigational tool for other
models of AKI such as x-ray contrast agent induced AKI,
rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI, or sepsis-induced AKI.
