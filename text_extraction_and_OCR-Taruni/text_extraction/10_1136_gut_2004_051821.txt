SUMMARY
A systematic review of the epidemiology of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) has been
performed, applying strict criteria for quality of studies and the disease definition used. The
prevalence and incidence of GORD was estimated from 15 studies which defined GORD as at least
weekly heartburn and/or acid regurgitation and met criteria concerning sample size, response
rate, and recall period. Data on factors associated with GORD were also evaluated.
An approximate prevalence of 10–20% was identified for GORD, defined by at least weekly
heartburn and/or acid regurgitation in the Western world while in Asia this was lower, at less
than 5%. The incidence in the Western world was approximately 5 per 1000 person years. A number of
potential risk factors (for example, an immediate family history and obesity) and comorbidities (for
example, respiratory diseases and chest pain) associated with GORD were identified.
Data reported in this systematic review can be interpreted with confidence as reflecting the
epidemiology of ‘‘true’’ GORD. The disease is more common in the Western world than in Asia,
and the low rate of incidence relative to prevalence reflects its chronicity. The small number of
studies eligible for inclusion in this review highlights the need for global consensus on a symptom
based definition of GORD.
c INTRODUCTION
The study of the epidemiology of GORD is restricted by the lack of consensus over the basic
definition of the disease. To review the global epidemiology of GORD is currently problematic as
there is no internationally applied definition, although the need for this has been recognised.1
Gastro-oesophageal reflux manifests as a continuum of symptom frequency and/or severity in the
general population. Occasional symptoms are experienced by a large proportion of the population
but GORD results from frequent or severe symptoms which are sufficient to impair the
individual’s health related quality of life (fig 1).
To establish the true prevalence of GORD, a symptom threshold must be defined which
adequately selects for patients whose quality of life is impaired as a result of their disease.
Experience of heartburn at least twice weekly is thought to be sufficient to result in impaired
quality of life.1 However, in keeping with the general lack of consensus in this area,
epidemiological studies reporting the prevalence of symptoms of GORD rarely refer to those
occurring twice weekly. More commonly, studies refer to weekly or at least weekly symptoms of
gastro-oesophageal reflux.
The aim of this paper is to systematically review the findings of studies which report the
prevalence or incidence of GORD, defined as symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux at least
weekly or by physician diagnosis. A realistic estimate of the prevalence of GORD can be made on
review of these studies. Data from these studies on the association of GORD with a range of risk
factors, comorbidities, and complications can then be interpreted with confidence.
STUDY SELECTION
Studies to be covered in the review were primarily identified via three Medline searches whose
terms reflected the symptomatic basis used for defining GORD. The search terms were selected to
identify studies describing the prevalence or incidence of GORD, and used ‘‘reflux’’ or
‘‘heartburn’’, together with ‘‘prevalence’’, ‘‘incidence’’, and ‘‘risk factor’’. As additional sources
of potential studies for inclusion, reviews of the epidemiology of GORD2 3 and our existing
database were also examined for appropriate publications.
The initial searches identified 36 studies which were suitable for further analysis. These
publications were then analysed according to predefined criteria. Eligible study samples were to
be selected from the general population or general practice, and either form part of a population
based study or serve as a control group, representative of the general population, in a case control

study. GORD was to be diagnosed through a symptom
questionnaire or by a clinician. Surveys were required to state
the prevalence of at least weekly heartburn, acid regurgita￾tion, or a combination of the two.
In order to ensure that included data were representative
of the general population, a sample size had to be reported
and the minimum sample size was set at 200. Sample size
was defined as the number of eligible individuals who were
approached for inclusion in the study. In order to minimise
response bias, studies were required to report a response rate
of at least 50%. Similarly, to reduce the chance of recall bias,
the recall period was required to be given as 12 months or
less.
Fifteen studies (originating from North America, Europe,
and Asia) met the criteria for inclusion in this review (tables 1
and 2). A further 21 studies did not meet the inclusion
criteria (table 3).
PREVALENCE OF GORD
North America
Some of the most comprehensive data on the epidemiology of
GORD are from the population of Olmsted County,
Minnesota, USA. Two published papers identified comorbid￾ities and risk factors,4 5 while a third, older study, reported
only the prevalence of GORD.6
Locke et al used the validated gastro-oesophageal reflux
questionnaire, distributed by post, to assess the prevalence of
GORD in a sample of Olmsted County residents between the
ages of 25 and 74 years, who were stratified according to age
and sex. The prevalence of at least weekly heartburn and/or
acid regurgitation reported in the 1997 and 1999 publications
was 19.8%4 and 20%,5 respectively. The prevalence of at least
weekly heartburn alone over the previous year in these two
studies was 17.8% and 17.4%.4 5 Acid regurgitation was less
common at 6.3% and 6.6%.4 5 Nearly half (42%) of those
subjects with at least weekly heartburn and/or acid regur￾gitation had experienced their symptoms for more than
10 years, and a further fifth (19%) for between 5 and
10 years.4
An older North American study was also conducted in the
population of Olmsted County. The validated bowel disease
questionnaire was sent to 1021 eligible subjects between
the ages of 30 and 64 years. Recalling their symptoms
over the past year, 13.2% of individuals reported at least
weekly heartburn and 6.5% reported at least weekly acid
regurgitation.6
Although these population based studies have provided
valuable data on the prevalence of GORD, the population of
Olmsted County does not accurately reflect that of the USA as
a whole, as it is disproportionately Caucasian: over 95% of
this population is White.4–6 The most recently published
survey of the prevalence of GORD in the USA focused
specifically on ethnic variation in the prevalence of GORD, by
recruiting subjects from the employees of the Houston
Veterans’ Affairs Medical Center, of whom 55% are black.
Using the gastro-oesophageal reflux questionnaire, at least
weekly heartburn was reported by 27% of Black and 23% of
White subjects, and at least weekly acid regurgitation by 16%
of Black and 15% of White subjects.7 These data are valuable

in that they highlight the fact that ethnicity is not a
significant predictor of either symptom. However, it should
be noted that this was in an employed study population,
which may not be representative of the population as a
whole.
Europe
Six of the studies which met the inclusion criteria originated
from Europe and, of these, two were carried out in the UK.
One, a study of genetic influences on GORD, recruited
subjects from the St. Thomas’ Adult UK Twin Registry. A
validated questionnaire was sent to all pairs of twins in this
registry. Of the 1960 evaluable twin pairs who responded,
18% reported having experienced heartburn and/or acid
regurgitation at least weekly over the previous year.8
The other UK study is considerably older. Thompson and
Heaton invited 327 apparently healthy British individuals to
be interviewed by a consultant gastroenterologist. These
subjects were all from the UK city of Bristol and were selected
from medical staff and students, a randomly selected
population undergoing screening for coronary artery disease,
and elderly residents of self catering flats. Eligible subjects
who agreed to be interviewed were aged 17–91 years and
reported experiencing heartburn at least weekly over the
previous year with a prevalence of 10.3%.9 The representa￾tiveness of this study sample is open to question as subjects
originated from a relatively limited geographical area and
were all either employed or care home residents.
A population based study in Finland was based on a
random sample of 2500 people aged 20 years or above, which
was obtained from the national population registry. A postal
questionnaire recorded heartburn and regurgitation, among
other symptoms, experienced on the day of response or
during the preceding week, month, and year. The study
population reported an equal prevalence of heartburn and
acid regurgitation (15%) during the previous week.10
A case control study of risk factors for oesophageal
adenocarcinoma carried out by Terry et al randomly selected
subjects for its control group from the Swedish population
register, who were frequency matched to resemble the age
and sex distribution among the cases for this study. It is
important to note that, in this case, frequency matching
limits the representativeness of the sample, as oesophageal
adenocarcinoma patients are generally elderly. The response
rate of 73% in this group yielded a total 1123 subjects, who
were interviewed face to face by a professional interviewer,
aided by computer. Recalling their symptoms over the
previous year, 16.7% of the control group had experienced
at least weekly heartburn and/or acid regurgitation.11
A study in Italy used physician interview to diagnose
GORD in staff of the San Matteo Hospital and the Military
Factory of Pavia. The 700 subjects who completed interviews

were aged 21–68 years. At least weekly heartburn was
reported by 7.7%, and regurgitation of the same frequency
by 6.6%.12 As this study population included only employed
individuals, these results may not be representative of the
population as a whole.
In a Spanish study by Diaz-Rubio et al, a random sample of
the general population of Spain was obtained from the
national telephone directory in computerised format. A
validated questionnaire was completed via telephone inter￾view and a response rate of 71% was sufficient to generate
the target sample of 2500 individuals. Recalling their
symptoms over the previous year, 9.8% of subjects reported
at least weekly heartburn or acid regurgitation. Similarly to
the Olmsted County study, 41.8% of those with weekly
symptoms reported having experienced them for 10 years or
more.13
Asia
The three eligible Asian studies were all carried out in Hong
Kong or China. Hu et al carried out a study in which ethnic
Chinese households in Hong Kong were contacted by
telephone, their telephone numbers having been randomly
generated by computer. A Chinese version of a previously
validated bowel symptom questionnaire was completed by
1649 subjects. These individuals, who were all at least
18 years old, reported at least weekly heartburn and/or acid
regurgitation with a prevalence of 4.8%.14
A second Chinese study also used a validated question￾naire, completed over the telephone, to assess symptoms of
gastro-oesophageal reflux. Ethnic Chinese households were
contacted, following random selection by computer from the
telephone directory, and the questionnaire was completed by
2209 subjects. These individuals, who were all over the age of
18 years, reported at least weekly heartburn and/or acid
regurgitation with a prevalence of 2.5%.15 It should be noted
that the use of a telephone survey in a developing country
may bias the study population towards the urban, and
possibly more wealthy, population.
The third of the Chinese studies was conducted by Pan et al.
Subjects were randomly selected from the adult population of
Beijing and Shanghai, and asked to complete a questionnaire
while assisted by trained doctors or medical students. Five
thousand residents of these two regions, aged 18–70 years,
provided data, with 3.1% reporting at least weekly heartburn
over the previous year.16
Inter-study comparisons
On the basis of inter-study comparisons, certain regional and/
or ethnic variations in the prevalence of GORD can be
identified (figs 2, 3). There is little difference between the
prevalence of GORD (as defined by heartburn and/or acid
regurgitation at least weekly) in North America (19.8–20%,
n = 2) and in Europe (9.8–18%, n = 3). There is some
indication that the prevalence may be lower in Southern
than Northern Europe. There is a definite trend, however,
towards a lower prevalence of GORD in Asia (2.5–4.8%,
n = 2).
On examining data on the prevalence of at least weekly
heartburn, a more defined trend emerges within the Western
world. The range of weekly heartburn prevalence in North
America (13.2–27%, n = 5) does appear to be higher than that
in Europe (7.7–15%, n = 3) although the Asian prevalence

(3.1%, n = 1) remains significantly lower than that seen in
Western regions. A similar pattern was seen for acid
regurgitation alone: 6.3–16% (n = 5) in North America versus
6.6–15% (n = 3) in Europe.
INCIDENCE OF GORD
Two longitudinal studies reporting the incidence of GORD
were identified, both based on records of GORD cases, as
diagnosed by physicians. The first study was carried out in
the UK General Practice Research Database.17 The authors
examined a source population of patients aged 2–79 years
who were enrolled with a participating general practitioner
for at least two years prior to 1996. They then identified those
patients with a first diagnosis of GORD during 1996. The
overall incidence of GORD was determined to be 4.5 per 1000
person years (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.4–4.7).
The second study was a longitudinal review of claims data
from Georgia Medicaid investigating the use of non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as a predisposing factor
for the development of GORD. This involved interrogation of
the records of all patients aged over 25 years and continu￾ously eligible for 1996, 1997, and 1998.18 Patients were
excluded if they had received a GORD diagnosis during 1996
or 1997, and were classified into GORD and control cohorts
according to GORD diagnoses in 1998. From the data
provided, it can be calculated that the incidence of GORD
within the whole study population (control and NSAID
cohorts) was 0.0054, or 5.4 per 1000 person years.
The diagnostic criteria in these studies are less clear than
the definitions used in the prevalence studies. Furthermore,
the data are probably influenced by consulting behaviour and
it is not clear what proportion of incident GORD cases
consulted a physician. However, these data relate to the
clinical understanding of the term GORD and are likely to be
relevant to everyday practice.
POTENTIAL RISK FACTORS AND COMORBIDITIES
ASSOCIATED WITH GORD
Cross sectional and longitudinal studies included in this
review also report the association of GORD with a number of
putative risk factors and possible, but not well accepted,
complications. These are presented in the section below in
four categories—namely, genetic, demographic, behavioural,
and comorbid associations. No prejudgement has been made
as to the causal nature of each individual relationship but the
four categories are discussed in order of their a priori
likelihood of being influenced by GORD (fig 4).
Genetic factors
There is sparse, but positive, data on the association between
GORD and genetic factors in the studies included in this
review.578 For example, a study of the St Thomas’ Adult UK
Twin Registry demonstrated that GORD was significantly
associated with a parental family history of reflux disease
(odds ratio (OR) 1.46 (95% CI 1.22–1.74)).8 It also high￾lighted the higher concordance in prevalence of GORD in
monozygotic over dizygotic twin pairs (pairwise concordance:
27% v 15%, p = 0.001; casewise concordance: 42% v 26%,
p,0.001) (fig 5). The second Olmsted County study demon￾strated a significant association between symptoms of GORD
and significant heartburn or disease of the oesophagus or
stomach in an immediate relative (OR 2.6 (95% CI 1.8–3.7)).5
The authors found no significant association however
between the presence of GORD and a positive history in the
subject’s spouse (OR 1.1 (95% CI 0.7–1.7)). These data imply
that a genetic component exists in the development of GORD,
exerting influence beyond that of any shared familial
environmental factors.

Demographic factors
Four cross sectional studies and one longitudinal study
investigated the influence of sex on the prevalence of GORD
symptoms.4 5 8 10 18 All five concluded that there was no
significant association between sex and GORD. This is despite
the well known association between symptoms of GORD and
pregnancy, as demonstrated in the Finnish study.10 It is
therefore noteworthy that several of the studies excluded
pregnant subjects from their analyses.8 10 17
The effect of increasing age on the prevalence of GORD
symptoms is unclear, with two European studies reporting a
slight but significant association.8 10 This relationship was not
seen for heartburn with or without acid regurgitation in
Olmsted County.4 5 In the UK GP database study, the
incidence of GORD increased with age in both men and
women until the age of 69 years, from which point the trend
was reversed.17 In the Georgia Medicaid study, a similar trend
was observed, although the trend reversed earlier, at
55 years.18 This study reported a marginally significant
increase in risk with increasing age (OR 1.1 (95% CI 1.0–
1.1)). Such studies of GORD defined on a symptomatic basis
are of course unable to evaluate the possibility that
objectively demonstrable aspects of GORD, such as reflux
oesophagitis, are more prevalent and/or severe in older
individuals.
Increasing prevalence of GORD was associated with excess
body mass/higher body mass index (BMI), with a reported
OR of 2.8 (95% CI 1.7–4.5) in Olmsted County.5 7 8 10 Higher
body mass was also significantly associated with the
incidence of GORD, with the UK GP database study reporting
a small but statistically significant association of GORD
diagnosis with BMI .25 (OR 1.3 (95% CI 1.2–1.4)) or BMI
.30 (OR 1.3 (95% CI 1.2–1.5)).17 The Georgia Medicaid study
also reported a clear positive relationship between GORD
diagnosis and obesity (OR 2.8 (95% CI 2.1–3.6)).18
Increasing GORD prevalence was associated with a lower
educational level.7 13 GORD was not associated however with
handedness (OR 1.06 (95% CI 0.82–1.36)).8
Behavioural factors
A number of behavioural factors are thought to trigger
gastro-oesophageal reflux episodes. The most commonly
investigated factors in the included studies were cigarette
smoking and coffee consumption. Three cross sectional
studies demonstrated a significant relationship between
GORD symptoms and smoking.5 8 10 Furthermore, the long￾itudinal studies also investigated the relationship with
smoking. The UK GP database study found that there were
significantly more ex-smokers (OR 1.2 (95% CI 1.1–1.4)) and
slightly more current smokers (OR 1.1 (95% CI 1.0–1.2)) in
patients with a new diagnosis of GORD than in the control
cohort.17 The Georgia Medicaid study revealed that the odds
of a GORD diagnosis were increased significantly by observed
tobacco use (OR 2.6 (95% CI 1.9–3.5)).
For coffee consumption, however, there are few data and
the picture is less clear. Two cross sectional studies reported
that there was no significant association with this behav￾ioural trait5 11 while a third identified an inverse relation￾ship.13 The Swedish study by Terry et al concentrated
particularly on behaviour relating to food consumption. In
addition to the lack of association with coffee consumption,
the authors also demonstrated that there was no association
with consumption of trigger foods (total fat, chocolate, mint,
coffee, onions, citrus fruits, and tomato), portion size of
meals, or time of the last meal of the day.11
The Georgia Medicaid study identified a significant
association between a GORD diagnosis and observed alcohol
consumption (OR 1.8 (95% CI 1.4–2.4)). This was consistent
with the positive association between GORD and alcohol
consumption reported in one cross sectional study (OR 1.9
(95% CI 1.1–3.3) for >7 drinks per week). In a second cross
sectional study, however, the association between GORD and
excess alcohol consumption (.28 units/week for a man, .21
units a week for a woman) did not reach statistical
significance (OR 0.99 (95% CI 0.99–1.0)).8 Likewise, alcohol
consumption did not significantly affect the risk of a first
time diagnosis of GORD in the UK GP database study.17
A number of significant associations were demonstrated
with the use of prescription medication. Increased use of
anticholinergic drug therapy was significantly associated
with the prevalence of GORD (OR 1.52 (95% CI 1.12–2.05)).8
The Olmsted County survey, however, found no significant
association between GORD and the use of aspirin (OR 0.8
(95% CI 0.4–1.7)) or NSAIDs (OR 0.9 (95% CI 0.5–1.6)).5 The
longitudinal UK GP database study demonstrated significant
associations between the incidence of GORD and current use
of NSAIDs (OR 1.5 (95% CI 1.3–1.7)) but not of aspirin (OR
1.1 (95% CI 0.9–1.3)). This study also revealed relationships
with the current use of nitrates (in the case of patients with
ischaemic heart disease) (OR 1.5 (95% CI 1.1–2.0)) and past
use of oral steroids (OR 1.3 (95% CI 1.1–1.5)).17
The study in the UK Twin Registry also reported a lack of
association of GORD with other drug treatments (including
benzodiazepines and calcium antagonists).8 This study did
however highlight an interesting inverse association between
symptoms of GORD and use of oral contraceptives or
hormone replacement therapy (OR 0.76 (95% CI 0.63–0.93)).8
Comorbid factors
A number of comorbidities of GORD were identified by the
studies included in this review. Several of the comorbidities
identified were gastrointestinal in origin. In the UK GP
database study, a history of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
(OR 1.6 (95% CI 1.2–2.1)) or peptic ulcer disease (OR 2.5
(95% CI 1.7–3.6)) was associated with an increased risk of
GORD diagnosis.17 A cross sectional UK study demonstrated
that GORD was significantly associated with abdominal pain
and symptoms or signs of abdominal IBS.9 In the Olmsted
County population, dysphagia and dyspepsia were shown to
be significantly associated with GORD whereas the asso￾ciation with globus sensation did not reach statistical
significance.4
The UK GP database study is also a particularly good
source of data on extra oesophageal morbidities which are
associated with GORD. In the year following the GORD
diagnosis, patients were at increased risk of a first time
diagnosis of cough (OR 1.7 (95% CI 1.4–2.1)), angina (OR 3.2
(95% CI 2.1–4.9)), gall bladder disease (OR 3.7 (95% CI 2.1–
6.7)), sinusitis (OR 1.6 (95% CI 1.2–2.0)), and chest pain (OR
2.3 (95% CI 1.8–2.8)). Associations with pneumonia, asthma,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), laryngitis,
hoarseness, and otitis failed to reach statistical significance.17
The longitudinal Georgia Medicaid study reported asthma to
be a significantly associated factor. However, asthma was
interpreted as a risk factor as it significantly increased the
odds of a GORD diagnosis (OR 3.2 (95% CI 2.6–4.0)).18
Similarly, although the UK database study did not identify

a significantly increased risk of COPD in the year following a
GORD diagnosis, prior COPD did slightly increase the risk of
GORD (OR 1.3 (95% CI 1.0–1.8)).17 The significant associa￾tion of GORD with chest pain was supported by the cross
sectional Olmsted County study.4 However, the association
between respiratory conditions (bronchitis and hoarseness)
and GORD failed to reach statistical significance.4
There is also evidence of the association of GORD with
psychosomatic/psychiatric factors. In China, both anxiety and
depression were found to be more common in patients with
GORD.14 Furthermore, two studies reported a significant
association of GORD with a psychosomatic checklist score (a
questionnaire based measurement of presence and frequency
of psychophysiological symptoms) in Western populations.5 13
CONCLUSIONS
A definition of GORD with a strict symptom frequency
threshold has been used in this systematic review in order to
allow a realistic assessment of the prevalence and incidence
of the disease. True GORD, with symptoms sufficient to
impair quality of life, appears to show global variation in its
prevalence. When defined as at least weekly heartburn and/or
acid regurgitation, the prevalence in the Western world
generally ranges between 10% and 20% whereas in Asia the
prevalence is reported to be less than 5%. There is a trend for
the prevalence in North America to be higher than that in
Europe, and a trend is also suggested for a higher prevalence
in Northern over Southern Europe. While these prevalence
values may represent a slight overestimate of the true
prevalence of GORD, given that symptoms at least twice
weekly is the definition which is thought to best predict
impaired quality of life,1 the same regional trends are also
seen in included studies of heartburn alone, and in the
Domestic/International Gastroenterology Surveillance Study
of upper gastrointestinal symptoms.19
Only two studies included in this review reported the
incidence of GORD, and both were based in the Western
world. From these limited data, the incidence of GORD can
be taken as approximately 5 per 1000 person years. This
incidence appears particularly low relative to the prevalence
of GORD but is consistent with the recognised chronicity of
the disease20; nearly half of affected individuals in the
population report experiencing symptoms for more than
10 years.4 13
A number of potential risk factors for GORD have been
identified by reviewing the epidemiological data reported in
the included studies. However, all of the positive associations
have rather small odds ratios, leaving their clinical implica￾tions for preventative or therapeutic strategies in doubt.
Furthermore, the limitations of cross sectional studies mean
that some of these associated factors cannot be described
categorically as risk factors or complications. Data from the
included longitudinal studies indicate that obesity and
possibly increasing age are risk factors for GORD, although
sex is not. The relationship with age is difficult to establish,
given that older patients may underreport reflux symptoms.21
The relationship with obesity has been confirmed in long￾itudinal studies of severe gastro-oesophageal reflux symp￾toms22 and of oesophagitis related hospitalisation,23 and may
contribute to the high prevalence of GORD in the USA
compared with the rest of the world. Genetics appear to play
a role in the epidemiology of GORD but the remarkable
geographic differences in prevalence are unlikely to be
explained purely on the basis of genetic variation. This
means that, as indicated by several recent studies in this
area,24–28 the relatively low prevalence of GORD in Asia may
not be sustained in the face of ongoing changes in diet and
lifestyle.
The lack of association of well accepted behavioural factors
with symptoms of GORD in cross sectional studies may
reflect behavioural adaptation (an ‘‘avoidance pattern’’) in
response to such symptoms. It is reasonable to expect that,
although behaviour such as alcohol consumption, smoking,
and diet may contribute to development of the disease, a
subject would also be likely to adapt their behaviour in
response to the experience of life impairing symptoms.
Therefore, behavioural risk factors are particularly difficult
to identify in cross sectional studies.
The included longitudinal and cross sectional studies show
that respiratory disease and chest pain are among a number
of complications of GORD, confirming the findings of other
studies of oesophagitis and hospitalisation.29–31 It is notable
that potential risk factors and complications tend to be less
strongly associated with GORD symptoms than they are with
oesophageal complications of GORD, such as erosive oeso￾phagitis and oesophageal adenocarcinoma.32–34
There is a notable lack of epidemiological data describing
GORD in children. Adulthood did not form part of the
inclusion criteria for this review yet only one of the studies
had a sample which included individuals under the age of
18 years.9 Given that symptoms suggestive of GORD are not
uncommon in children35 and may give rise to a range of
respiratory complications in this age group,30 this is an area
which should be further explored. Longitudinal data could
prove particularly valuable for the study of the progression of
GORD from infancy to adulthood. Further studies are also
needed to investigate the influence of Helicobacter pylori
infection and temporal trends in GORD prevalence.
In summary, GORD, defined as symptoms likely to impair
quality of life, affects up to 20% of the Western population
and is associated with a range of risk factors. An under￾standing of the potential extra oesophageal complications of
GORD, primarily of the respiratory system, will aid the
physician in diagnosing and managing this chronic
disease.
