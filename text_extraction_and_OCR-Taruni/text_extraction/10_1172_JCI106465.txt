A B S T R A C T Angiotensin II was determined by ra￾dioimmunoassay in systemic arterial, pulmonary arterial,
and renal venous plasma and in renal hilar lymph in
dogs. Levels of the peptide were determined prior to and
during progressive graded hemorrhage or reduction in
renal perfusion pressure. Levels of angiotensin II in
plasma consistently rose during transit through the lung
indicating pulmonary conversion of angiotensin I to
angiotensin II. On the other hand, angiotensin II in the
renal vein plasma was less than that in arterial plasma
indicating renal extraction of the peptide from plasma.
When renal hilar lymph was sampled under similar
conditions, angiotensin II in lymph was consistently
higher than that in arterial or renal venous plasma.
Furthermore, in some experiments angiotensin II in
lymph increased at a time when the concentration in
plasma was undetectable. No evidence was found to indi￾cate that angiotensin II in plasma entered renal lymph.
It was concluded that angiotensin II levels in lymph re￾flected the concentration of angiotensin II in renal tis￾sue. The data further suggested that angiotensin II is
partially removed from arterial plasma by hydrolysis
during transit through the -kidney.
INTRODUCTION
Several investigators have proposed models in which
angiotensin II (AII) is a critical mediator for the con￾trol of glomerular filtration rate (1), renal autoregula￾tion (2), and tubular sodium reabsorption (3, 4). It
is not clear whether the AII postulated to mediate these
control mechanisms is produced within the kidney or
reaches the kidney from the systemic circulation.
This work was presented in part at the meeting of the
American Federation for Clinical Research, Atlantic City,
N. J., 3 May 1970 (Clin. Res. 18: 493).

The production of All requires angiotensinogen and
renin for the formation of angiotensin I (Al) and con￾verting enzyme(s) for generation of All from AI. Ng
and Vane have demonstrataed that All in the systemic
circulation is mainly derived from the conversion of AI
in the pulmonary capillary bed (5). If All is produced
locally within the kidney, then the appropriate enzyme
systems must be present in renal tissue. Bakhle, Reynard,
and Van were unable to demonstrate conversion of AI
to All in the kidney (6). Recently however, Gocke,
Gerten, Sherwood, and Laragh, by use of a radioimmuno￾assay for All, found increased concentrations of the
peptide in the renal venous plasma of affected kidneys
in patients with unilateral renal artery obstruction and
hypertension (7). This finding would suggest that gen￾eration of All can take place in the kidney.
In order to investigate further the metabolisnr of All
by both lung and kidney, a sensitive radioimmiunoassay
has been used to determine the concentration of All in
systemic arterial, renal venous, and pulmonary arterial
plasma, and renal lymph during stimuli usually associ￾ated with increased renin secretion by the kidney. The
results support the concept that the lung is a major site
of conversion of AI to All and that All is extracted
from plasma during transit through the kidney. How￾ever, high levels of All in renal lymph when plasma
levels are undetectable suggest the generation of All
within the kidney and the presence of the enzyme(s)
needed for conversion of AI to All.
METHODS
Preparation of aniimals. Experiments were carried out
on mongrel dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium
(30 mg/kg). A peripheral vein was catheterized for infusion
of solutions and additional anesthetic agent. Both femoral
arteries were catheterized to record blood pressure by
strain-gauge transducer, (Statham P23 AA), obtain arterial
blood samples, and remove blood for the purpose of inducing
hypotension. In all experiments the left kidney was exposed
through an extraperitoneal flank incision and a catheter
placed in the left renal vein.

In those animals in which hypotension was induced by
bleeding, the right kidney was removed through a flank
incision; this procedure eliminated a source of renin or
AII other than that from the kidney being studied. In
some experiments, in order to sample pulmonary arterial
blood, a catheter was passed into the pulmonary artery via
the external jugular vein using pressure as a guide to
placement. In seven experiments a hilar lymph vessel was
isolated and cannulated with polyethylene tubing (PE 12).
In three animals reduction in renal arterial perfusion pres￾sure was accomplished by tightening a snare placed around
the aorta above the renal artery. In those experiments
involving intrarenal arterial infusions, a curved 23 gauge
needle attached to a polyethylene catheter was placed
directly into the renal artery.
A minimum of 1 hr was allowed for the recovery of
the animal after the completion of surgery, and all animals
were heparinized prior to the beginning of the experiment.
All blood samples were drawn into plastic syringes and
immediately transferred to chilled tubes containing disodium
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Renal lymph was
collected in similarly chilled tubes. After centrifugation
at 4°C, the plasma was removed and both plasma and
lymph stored at -20'C until assayed for angiotensin.
Radioimmunoassay of angiotensin II. The radioimmuno￾assay used was a modification of the method previously
described by Gocke and coworkers (7). Antisera were pro￾duced in rabbits after immunization with aspartyl-l-valyl-5
angiotensin II (Ciba) conjugated to rabbit serum albumin
(Pentex), as described by Goodfriend, Levine, and Fasman
(8). Radioiodinated angiotensin II (AII-'"I) was obtained
from a commercial source (Cambridge Nuclear Corp.).
To prepare the incubation mixture, standard AII or
unknown plasma was added to 0.1 M Tris buffer (pH 8.6)
containing 1 mg/ml lysozyme and 2 mg/ml neomycin sulfate.
To this solution 50 Al of antiserum (dilution 1: 3000) and
50 pl of labeled hormone containing 5 Agg AII (1500-2000
cpm) were added. To keep the protein content of the stan￾dards similar to that of the unknowns, 100 pl of AII-free
plasma was added to the standard tubes. This plasma was
prepared by dialyzing plasma for 24 hr against distilled
water and 24 hr against 0.003 M disodium EDTA at 4VC.
The final volume of the incubation mixture was brought to
0.5 ml with Tris buffer. The tubes were incubated for 24 hr
at 40C.
Separation of antibody-bound and free AII was accom￾plished with dextran-coated charcoal (9); 100 Al of dex￾tran-coated charcoal was added to the incubation mixture
and the tubes centrifuged at 10,000 g for 15 min at 40C.
400A1 of supernatant was removed after which the charcoal
was washed once with cold buffer. Both supernatant and
charcoal were counted in a well type scintillation counter
(Tracer Lab), and the per cent labeled hormone bound to
antibody was calculated. Concentration of AII in unknowns
was expressed as picograms per milliliter of plasma or
lymph.

and Triton X-100 (Packard).
RESULTS
Characterization of the radioimmunoassay. Gocke et
al., utilizing Tris buffer at pH 7.5, found that replacement
of plasma in the incubation mixture with buffer resulted
in a shift in the standard curve, most likely owing to the
change in protein concentration (7). This is demon￾strated in Fig. 1 where the percentage of labeled anti￾gen bound to antibody is plotted against the concentration
of standard AII in the incubation mixture. At pH 7.5
the curve is shifted upward when plasma is replaced
with buffer. On the other hand, at pH 8.6 the curve is
not affected by removal of plasma. This modification is
significant because the protein content of renal lymph is
less than that of plasma (10).
Fig. 2 demonstrates that the naturally occurring AII
in unknown plasma and the standard AII added to
plasma react in a similar manner with the antibody.

The addition of 'I-labeled AII in increasing 50-Al
increments from 50 to 350 ul results in a uniform de￾pression of binding as shown in Fig. 3. This finding
indicates that the labeled hormone has a reactivity with
the antibody similar to that of the standard material.
The specificity of the antibody for AII in comparison
to AI was determined. It was found that there was less
than 1% cross-reactivity with AI up to concentrations of
3000 pg/ml in the incubation mixture. The recovery of
standard AII added to AII-free plasma is essentially
100% as indicated by Fig. 4.
Table I shows the results of analysis of six different
plasma samples on 4 separate days. The variation in
the result is greater at the low concentrations. However,
duplicate determination of the per cent binding of AII-
'I to antibody were consistently reproducable to within
10%.
The system is, therefore, a sensitive, specific, and
reproducible method for the determination of AI. It has
the advantage over the previously described method in
that it is not sensitive to protein concentration in the
incubation mixture.

terial blood were sampled during progressive hemorrhage.
Hemorrhage was accomplished by continuous removal of
arterial blood at 2.5 ml/min using an infusion pump (The
Holter Co., Bridgeport, Pa.). The results of one of these
experiments are shown in Table II. The concentration
of AII in arterial plasma rose as hemorrhage progressed.
There was a consistent increase in the concentration dur￾ing transit through the lung as demonstrated by the dif￾ference in the aortic and pulmonary artery concentra￾tions: pulmonary generation averaged 92%. By con￾trast, the concentration in the renal vein was consisently
less than that in the aorta: renal extraction averaged
64%. Similar results were obtained in all five experi￾ments (Table III). The level of AII in the renal vein
was less than that in the aorta in all 45 simultaneously
collected samples in the five experiments. Extraction by
the kidney was greater than 40% in 39 samples.

summarized in Table IV. Levels of AII in renal lymph
were consistently greater than the concentration in either
aorta or renal vein. Hemorrhage resulted in increased
lymph AII concentrations in all experiments, and in two
animals this rise in lymph level was unassociated with
any significant change in plasma levels (Table IV, ex￾periments 3 and 4). The increase in lymph concentra￾tions was seen prior to any changes in blood pressure;

this is most notable in experiment 3. Furthermore, in the
first two experiments in Table IV, lymph concentrations
of AII rose in the face of continuing renal extraction.
In three experiments renal lymph was collected dur￾ing reduction in renal perfusion pressure (Table V).
Renal lymph concentration of AII increased when the
perfusion pressure was reduced and fell when the pres￾sure returned to control levels. Lymph levels of AII were
again consistently greater than plasma. In experiments
2 and 3 (Table V) lymph flow from the single cannulated
vessel was determined; flow increased in experiment 2
and in experiment 3 fell by less than 50% while AII
concentration increased more than 13 times.
Origin of AII in renal lymph. In order to determine
whether the AII in renal lymph represents extraction of
the peptide from arterial plasma or is produced de novo
in the renal interstitium, the following studies were car￾ried out in three dogs. After obtaining a control collection
of renal lymph, 5-L-isoleucine-"C angiotensin II (New
England Nuclear) was infused directly into the renal
artery at the rate of approximately 30,000 cpm/min
(35,000 pg/min). A period of 15 min was allowed for

equilibrium and then the renal perfusion pressure was
reduced to 90-100 mm Hg by an aortic snare. 15 min
after the pressure was reduced a second collection of
lymph was begun and continued for 1 hr. The specific
activity of the infusate, renal arterial plasma, and renal
lymph were compared. The amounts of 14C and AII in
the infused solution, plasma, and renal lymph were de￾termined by liquid scintillation counting and radioim￾munoassay respectively. The specific activity of the
renal arterial plasma was estimated from the infusion
rate of labeled AI, concentration of AII in arterial
plasma, and the renal plasma flow estimated from the
clearance of sodium p-aminohippurate.

As can be seen from Table VI the reduction of renal
perfusion pressure was associated with a rise in the con￾centration of AII in renal lymph as previously observed.
In each case the specific activity of the AII in the renal
lymph was significantly less than that in the renal ar￾terial plasma. Since we are unable to determine whether
the "C in lymph is actually AII or hydrolyzed fragments,
the values for specific activity in lymph are maximal.
It is important to emphasize that the infusion of AII-"C
was begun 15 min before aortic constriction while renal
lymph concentrations of AII were low. Therefore, the
low specific activity in renal lymph cannot be attributed
to failure of labeled AII to equilibrate with a large pool
of intrarenal AI, but instead must reflect the de novo
synthesis of new unlabeled AI.
Mechanism of removal of All from renal plasma. In
order to define the mechanism of removal of AII from
plasma during transit through the kidney, 5-L-isoleucine￾1'C angiotensin II was infused directly into the renal
artery. The "C-labeled peptide was first diluted in AII￾free plasma, and then 1 ml of this plasma infused over a
30 sec period into the artery. To reduce circulating en￾dogenous AII, renin secretion was suppressed by ex￾panding the animal with isotonic saline infused at 20 ml/
min for 1 hr prior to the infusion of labeled peptide.
Arterial and renal venous blood were obtained before
starting the infusion and then sampled at 15-sec intervals
for 45-120 sec after starting the infusion. The amount
of 14C and AII in the infused solution, and in arterial and
renal venous plasma was determined. Results were ex￾pressed as the ratio of AII in picograms per milliliter
to "C in counts per minute per milliliter (AII/"C). A
constancy of this ratio between the infused plasma and
renal venous plasma indicates that the AII has passed
through the kidney unchanged. On the other hand, as
shown in Table VII, in all but one of eight experiments
the ratio in the renal vein was less than that in the in￾fused plasma. This latter finding indicates that some of
the "C leaving the kidney is no longer immunologically
reactive and, therefore, has been altered in transit
through the kidney.
DISCUSSION
The finding of an increase in the plasma AII concentra￾tion after transit through the lung is in agreement with
the results of Ng and Vane (5). The lung is the only
organ which has been shown to convert AI in the plasma
to AII. Furthermore, while liver, kidney, and limb have
been shown to inactivate AI, lung does not appear to
remove AII from the plasma (11, 12). The possibility
exists that AI is converted to AII in several organs and
is destroyed before entering the venous effluent.
The finding by Gocke et al. of elevated AII levels in
renal venous plasma in patients with renal hypertension
suggests that AII is being formed within the kidney
under these circumstances (7). Skinner, McCubbin, and
Page reported pressor material in both renal vein and
thoracic duct lymph after acutely reducing the renal
perfusion pressure in dogs (13). These authors con￾tended that the pressor material was AII. Lever and
Peart previously reported increased concentrations of
renin and pressor material in renal lymph but not in re￾nal venous plasma during similar conditions (14).
In the present acute experiments elevated levels of
AII in renal vein were not demonstrated during either
hemorrhage or reduced renal perfusion pressure (Ta￾ble III). However, the concentration of AII in renal
lymph was clearly elevated with these maneuvers and was
always greater than that in plasma (Tables IV and V).
Several factors might explain both the high lymph
concentration of AII and the increase during hemorrhage
and reduced perfusion pressure. The rise in AII concen￾tration in lymph cannot be ascribed to a fall in lymph
flow rate (Table VII) and appears to be due to the ad￾TABLE VII

dition of AII to the lymph. The AII appearing in the
lymph might be derived from peptide removed from the
arterial plasma. This is unlikely since the levels of AII
in lymph increased in the face of undetectable arterial
and renal venous concentrations of AII (Tables IV and
V). The concentrations in lymph do not appear to be
due to differential binding of AII in renal lymph since
in vitro experiments have failed to demonstrate any sig￾nificant binding in either plasma or lymph. Most im￾portantly, however, when 14C-labeled AII was continu￾ously infused into the renal artery during aortic con￾striction, the specific activity of AII in renal lymph
was much less than that in the renal arterial plasma
(Table VI). This clearly demonstrates that AII in
renal lymph is a consequence of de novo synthesis of
the peptide within the kidney rather than extraction of
AII from the plasma.
The most likely explanation of the experimental find￾ings is that AII is generated within the kidney through
the interaction of angiotensinogen, renin, and converting
enzyme and that the concentration of AII in lymph is a
reflection of the concentration of free AII in the renal
interstitium. The finding by Hosie et al. that the concen￾tration of angiotensinogen in renal lymph is low while
renin concentration may be higher than arterial or renal
venous plasma further suggests that the AII found in
lymph is generated within the kidney (15). The apparent
independance of the AII levels in lymph and plasma sug￾gest that the hormone in renal tissue is not in equilibrium
with that in plasma.
High AII concentration in renal tissue might come
about in several ways. First, renin may be released from
the juxtaglomerular cells into both the circulation and
the renal extracellular space at the same rate. The dif￾ference in volume of distribution between the plasma and
renal interstitial space might then result in a difference
in renin concentration and, therefore, the amount of AII
formed. Second, AII may be generated and stored within
cells in the kidney and released selectively into the ex￾tracellular space. The present data do not distinguish
between these two alternatives.
Despite the fact that AII is present in lymph in con￾centrations greater than that in either arterial or renal
venous plasma, the kidney extracts 40-70% of AII in
plasma during a single transit. Part of the mechanism by
which AII is extracted from the arterial plasma by kidney
may be explained by the present studies. Since the frac￾tional extraction of AII by kidney (40-70%) is greater
than the expected filtration fraction, the mechanism must
involve more than filtration and urinary excretion alone;
insignificant amounts of '4C appear in the urine after
infusion of "4C-labeled AII into the renal artery. Re￾moval in lymph does not appear to play an important
part since virtually none of the injected AII-"C ap￾peared in renal lymph. The finding of a decrease in the
AII/14C ratio in the renal venous plasma suggests that
the All is being hydrolyzed during transit through the
kidney and, therefore, becomes immunologically un￾reactive. The data of Cain, Catt, and Coghlan indicate
that some of the All breakdown products in venous
plasma may react with antibody directed against All
(16), suggesting that the assay may overestimate the
venous levels; renal extraction may in fact be greater
than the data indicate. The fact that 40-70% of arterial
All can be removed from plasma during transit through
the kidney (Table III) in association with the finding
that All appears to be hydrolyzed rather than excreted
by the kidney suggests that the removal process is medi￾ated by intravascular angiotensinase, probably located
in the renal vascular endothelium.
Several important physiological implications can be
drawn from the present studies. First, exceedingly high
tissue concentrations of All suggest that this hormone
plays an important intrarenal regulatory role during
hemorrhage and reduced renal perfusion pressure. Sec￾ond, the intrarenal concentrations of All are in no way
reflected in the arterial and renal venous levels. The
peptide in the renal interstitium is, therefore, in a com￾partment which is not in equilibrium with plasma. Third,
a large fraction of either naturally generated All or
exogenous All in arterial plasma is removed in a single
passage through the kidney, presumably by hydrolysis;
consequently little of the hormone in plasma appears to
reach the important sites of intrarenal action other
than vascular smooth muscle.
The exact physiological function subserved by the
generation of high intrarenal concentrations of All is
not clear. One possibility is that All generated in the
kidney reaches the systemic circulation via the renal
lymph and thoracic duct and thus contributes to the con￾trol of systemic All levels. This possibility cannot be
completely evaluated by the present experiments since
the concentration of All above and below the entrance
of the thoracic duct into the vena cava was not deter￾mined. However, the large increase in All concentration
during transit through the lung indicates that pulmonary
conversion of Al to All is the primary mechanism de￾termining the circulating systemic level of All (11).
Other investigators have suggested that the intrarenal
release of All plays a role in the control of tubular so￾dium reabsorption or mediates autoregulation of renal
blood flow and glomerular filtration rate (1-3, 17). The
present studies do not permit evaluation of these two
possibilities.
