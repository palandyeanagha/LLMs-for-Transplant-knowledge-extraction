Abstract
Background: In this study, we sought to evaluate the feasibility of improved transcatheter aortic valve implantation
(TAVI) in noncalcified aortic valve by using the novel concept of double-layer ChenValve prosthesis. TAVI was
initially considered as an alternative treatment for high-risk patients with aortic stenosis. However, non noncalcified
aortic valve disease was considered as a contraindication to TAVI.
Methods: ChenValve prosthesis, which consisted of a self-expanding Nitinol ring, a balloon-expandable cobalt￾chromium alloy stent and a biological valve, was implanted at the desired position under fluoroscopic guidance in
a transapical approach through a 20F sheath in 10 goats. Aortic angiography was performed to measure the
diameter of the aotic annulus and assess the performance of the artificial valve. The ultrasound was used to
evaluate the regurgitation or paravalvular leakage and trans-prosthetic vascular flow velocity postoperatively. The
aortogram and transthoracic echocardiography were applied to observe whether the valve stent was implanted at
the desired position.
Results: ChenValve prosthesis was successfully transppical implanted in all animals. The aortogram and
transthoracic echocardiography performed immediately after implantation revealed that the valve stent was
implanted at the desired position. There was no significant paravalvular leakage, obstruction of coronary artery
ostia, stent malpositioning or dislodgement occurred.
Conclusions: This preliminary trial with the novel double-layer ChenValve prosthesis demonstrated the feasibility of
improved TAVI in noncalcified aortic valve. The mechanism of Nitinol ring-guided locating the aortic sinus enables
us to anatomically correct position the artifact valve. This improved strategy seems to make the TAVI process more
safe and repeatable in noncalcified aortic valve.

Background
Aortic valve disease is common among elderly individuals,
and its prevalence increases with age [1]. Transcatheter aor￾tic valve implantation (TAVI) is developed as the standard
of care for inoperable patients with severe symptomatic cal￾cific aortic stenosis and is recommended by clinical practice
guidelines [2, 3]. However, TAVI is rendered less effective
in patients with pure aortic valve regurgitation. The stand￾ard of care for these patients remains surgical aortic valve
replacement [4, 5]. The main reason is that the noncalcified
aortic valve lacks fluoroscopic landmarks and anchor site
for prosthesis, which tends to increase the risk of prosthesis
dislocation in TAVI [6, 7]. In addition, absent or minimal
calcification of aortic valve induced insufficient anchoring
results in prosthesis dislodgement, which can lead to poor
prognosis. For these reasons, improving the TAVI is critical
for the therapy of AR.
The Edwards HELIO transcatheter aortic dock is a novel
approach for the treatment of NAVR and this method uses a
pre-placed dock behind the aortic leaflets to facilitate im￾plantation of a SAPIEN XT valve [8]. However, the whole
procedure is too complicated to be popularized in clinic
practice. Another technique is to use two pigtail catheters to
place in two coronary sinuses [9]. This technique could sig￾nificantly reduce the valve stent dislocation in TAVI using
CoreValve prosthesis for AR patients. However, the follow￾up residual aortic regurtitation requires to implant a second
valve [9]. A small single-centered series demonstrated the
feasibility of transapical TAVI with the new generation self￾expandable ACURATE TA device (Symetis SA, Ecublens,
Switzerland) in high-risk patients with severe AR [10]. How￾ever, the size of delivery system of AVURATE device was
too large (28F) for transapical TAVI, which would cause add￾itional injuries to cardiac muscle. The new generation of
Jena-Valve prosthesis (JenaValve Tchnology GmbH, Munich,
Germany) is featured with a unique clip fixation mechanism
of the native aortic valve leaflets that might offer anchorage
for the valve stent during TAVI for AR [11]. The JenaValve
was proved to be a promising therapeutic strategy [12] and
becomes the only TAVI device approved for the treatment
of high-risk or inoperable patients with severe AR.
In this study, we developed the ChenValve with a
novel double-layer stent and featured with a nitinol
outer-ring. This unique design could ensure the accurate
position of the aortic sinus and provide an anchor for
prosthesis to improve the success rate of TAVI in non￾calcified aortic valve. The purpose of the study was to
evaluate the feasibility of transapical TAVI by the using
ChenValve in a goat model.
Methods
Aortic valve stent and delivery device design
The ChenValve prosthesis and delivery device was de￾signed for transapical aortic valve implantation and was
made by LePu Medical Technology (Beijing) Co.,Ltd..
The ChenValve prosthesis (Fig. 1) consisted of a
balloon-expandable cobalt-chromium alloy stent, a self￾expanding nitinol ring and a biological valve. Nitinol
ring was designed for three “feelers” to be placed into
the three aortic sinuses to achieve an anatomically cor￾rect position of aortic valve annulus. The stent was made
of cobalt-chromium alloy by laser cutting and had an
overall length of 18 mm. Two parts of this device were
connected by three V-shape Nitinol memory alloy
threads. Three leaflets cut from tissue-fixated porcine
pericardium were mounted on the stent. The additional
polyester skirt sealed the cells of the cobalt-chromium
alloy stent frame to prevent paravalvular leaks. The
diameter of Nitinol ring was designed to be 3 mm less
than that of the stent. The prothesis was available in
sizes of 20, 23, and 26 mm, according to the diameter of
the stent. All sizes could be loaded into a 20F delivery
system for implantation.
The stent delivery system was comprised of an outer
sheath (20F) and a stent delivery catheter which formed
an integral unit (Fig. 2). The proximal segment of a stent
delivery catheter was an inflatable balloon. The valved
stent was compressed on the balloon and then be with￾drawn into the outer sheath by retracting the delivery
catheter. The tip of the delivery catheter had a conical
smooth transition made of silica gel material to allow
implantation of the delivery catheter by performing ap￾ical puncturing. The delivery system allowed a two-step
release of the prosthesis: first, releasing the Nitinol ring
to locate the aortic annulus, and then releasing the
cobalt-chromium alloy stent by injecting the balloon
with diluted contrast agent once achieved a correct posi￾tioning. According to the size of the balloons, the stent
delivery system was classified into 20, 23, and 26 mm
sizes, respectively.
Experimental animals
Ten healthy goats (5 male and 5 female), with an average
weight of 22.3 ± 1.85 kg, were obtained from the Marine
Animal Medical Research Institute. Animal studies were
approved by the Experimental Animal Ethics Committee
of Zhongshan Hospital (Approval no.20170426181252).
All animals received humane care in compliance with
the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
(www.nap.edu/catalog/5140.html). Each goat was anes￾thetized by intramuscular injection of ketamine (10-mg/
kg) after 8 h of fasting, followed by intravenous injection
of propofol (0.2 mg·kg− 1
·min− 1
). The airway was main￾tained by endotracheal intubation and a respirator.
Valve stent implantation
The electrocardiogram and oxygen saturation were mon￾itored throughout the entire operation. The right

femoral artery and femoral vein were punctured and
inserted with a 6-Fr leak-proof sheath. Heparin 50 U/kg
IV was administered. The temporary pacing lead was in￾troduced into the apex of the right ventricle via femoral
vein sheath. A 6-Fr pigtail catheter was delivered via
femoral artery sheath. Aortic angiographic procedures
were performed to determine the best imaging position
and the diameter of the aortic annulus was measured
(Fig. 3a). The valve stent size should be suitable to the
annulus diameter, and then was compressed to the bal￾loon of the delivery catheter by using a crimping ma￾chine. The diameter of the selected stent was 2–4 mm
larger than the that of the animal aortic annulus. Trans￾apical access was achieved through a left anterolateral
minithoracotomy in the fourth intercostals space and
purse-string sutures with 4–0 Prolene were applied to
the left ventricular apex. The apex of the left ventricle
was punctured, and then a stiff guidewire was inserted
and acrossed the aortic valve into the descending aorta
under fluoroscopic guidance (Fig. 3b). A 20-Fr delivery
system with the ChenValve prosthesis was inserted into
the left ventricle from the heart apex over the stiff guide￾wire (Fig. 3c).
The delivery catheter was fixed when prosthesis had
advanced into a supra-annular position under fluoro￾scopic guidance. Then the outer sheath was withdrawn
slowly, and the Nitinol alloy outer-ring of prosthesis
automatically expanded. Then the operator located the
three positioning “fellers” of Nitinol ring in the corre￾sponding three aortic sinuses on fluoroscopy, thereby
embracing the native leaflets (Fig. 3d). After correct pos￾ition of three “fellers” was verified in 2 different fluoro￾scopic angulations. Ventricular temporary rapid pacing
(250–300 beats/min) was used to slow down the velocity
of blood flow from the left ventricle and reduced the
movement amplitudes of aortic annulus. Then the pros￾thesis was expanded and precise released in ideal loca￾tion by injecting the balloon with a contrast agent
diluted 5:1 (Fig. 3e).
The contrast agent was extracted when the valve stent
was fully opened. Temporary pacing was shut down,
then the delivery catheter and guidewire were retraced
from the heart and the apex closed with the purse string
suture. Subsequently, the position of the valve stent and
performance of the artificial valve were assessed by aor￾tic angiography (Fig. 3f).

Postoperative treatment
The chest was closed if no active bleeding occured in
the thoracic cavity. After the sheaths of the femoral ar￾tery and vein were removed, the hemostasis of femoral
artery was performed by applying direct pressure to
puncture points for 20 min. Propofol was not used until
15 min before the end of the operation. After the oper￾ation, 0.5-mg atropine and 1-mg neostigmine were intra￾venously injected to reverse muscle relaxation, and 160–
320 million units of penicillin were administered to pre￾vent postoperative infection. The tracheal catheter of the
experimental goat was removed when autonomous res￾piration and blood pressure were restored. Penicillin was

administered for 7 days to prevent infection, and then
low-molecular-weight heparin and aspirin were adminis￾tered for 3 and 90 days, respectively. The wound was dis￾infected daily with iodine. 2 weeks later, the sutures
were removed.
Assessment of valve stent position and functionality
In each case, the location and function of the prosthetic
aortic valve were detected by aortic root angiography
and transthoracic echocardiography immediately after
the operation. One randomly selected goat was eutha￾nized two hours after successful implantation for macro￾scopic inspection at necropsy. The general health status
of goat models, including eating, defecation, and activ￾ities, were observed. The performance of the prosthetic
aortic valve, including perivalvular leakage and aortic re￾gurgitation, was evaluated by transthoracic echocardiog￾raphy 1 month after operation.
Statistical analyses
All the statistical analyses were performed using the
SPSS 18.0 software package. The measurement data
were indicated as mean ± SD. The data from the differ￾ent groups were analyzed using a repeated-measures
method. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
The deployment of prostheses for all 10 goats were suc￾cessfully completed. The mean diameter of the valve
stent was 21.18 ± 1.28 mm. The operation duration and
X-ray exposure time were 128.90 ± 10.67 min and
14.40 ± 3.44 min, respectively (Table 1). In each case, the
results from aortogram and transthoracic echocardiog￾raphy (Fig. 5) that were applied immediately after im￾plantation revealed that the valve stent was implanted at
the desired position, There were no obstruction of
coronary artery ostia, malpositioning or stent dislodge￾ment occurred. No moderate--gross regurgitation or
paravalvular leakage were observed. One goat (No. 6)
was sacrificed 2 h after successful implantation to ob￾serve the position and function of the valve. The cardiac
anatomy of the sacrificed animal showed that the valve
stent was well “anchored” on the aortic wall of desired
position (Fig. 6). Three “fellers” of Outer-ring of Pros￾thesis were taken to locate the three aortic sinus. The
upper edge of the valve stent was lowered from coronary
artery ostia by 3-5 mm, while the lower edge of the valve
stent was far away from the mitral valve. The functions
of the coronary artery and mitral valve were not affected.
The remaining 9 goats survived for more than 1 month
with normal diet and activity. Transthoracic color Dop￾pler ultrasound performed 1 month after operation
showed normal trans-prosthetic vascular flow velocity
and normal position of the prosthetic valve without
stenosis, insufficiency apparent and stent dislodgement.
Discussion
There has been emerged some devices for TAVI. The
Edwards HELIO transcatheter aortic dock used a pre￾placed dock behind the aortic leaflets to facilitate im￾plantation of a SAPIEN XT valve [8]. CoreValve pros￾thesis had two pigtail catheters to place in two
coronary sinuses to significantly reduce the valve
stent dislocation in TAVI for AR patients [9]. The
ACURATE TA device (Symetis SA, Ecublens,
Switzerland) is used for high-risk patients with severe
AR, however, the delivery system was too large (28F)
for transapical TAVI [10]. The Jena-Valve prosthesis
(JenaValve Tchnology GmbH, Munich, Germany) of￾fered anchorage for the valve stent during TAVI for
AR [11] and is a promising therapeutic strategy [12]
for high-risk or inoperable patients with severe AR.

However, all these devices have their limitations. The
Edwards HELIO transcatheter aortic dock is novel ap￾proach for the treatment of NAVR, which uses a pre￾placed dock behind the aortic leaflets to facilitate im￾plantation of a SAPIEN XT valve [8]. But the whole
procedure is too complicated to generalize this tech￾nique in clinic practice. Another technique for placing
pigtail catheters in two coronary sinuses was useful to
decrease valve stent dislocation in TAVI using Core￾Valve prosthesis for AR patients [9]. The result of oper￾ation was not ideal, and the residual aortic regurtitation
required implantation of a second valve in 8 of 43 pa￾tients due to residual AR. A small single-centered series
demonstrates the feasibility of transapical TAVI with
the new generation self-expandable ACURATE TA de￾vice (Symetis SA, Ecublens, Switzerland) in high-risk
patients with severe AR [10]. However, the size of deliv￾ery system of AVURATE device is too large (28F) for
transapical TAVI and would cause more damage of car￾diac muscle. The new generation of Jena-Valve pros￾thesis (JenaValve Tchnology GmbH, Munich, Germany)
features a unique clip fixation mechanism of the native
aortic valve leaflets that may offer anchorage of the
valve stent during TAVI for AR [11]. The JenaValve
had demonstrated promising results [12] . However,
Jena-Valve prosthesis is only a implanted transapical
approach.
The present study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of
ChenValve prosthesis, which consists of a self-expanding
nitinol ring and a balloon-expandable cobalt-chromium
alloy stent. The mechanism of Nitinol ring-guided locat￾ing the aortic sinus allows for anatomically oriented im￾plantation of stent in noncalcified aortic valves. Not only
can the correct position of Nitinol ring be verified in
fluoroscopic angulations, but also the tactile feedback
(movement of the delivery catheter once the three
“feeler” against the three aortic sinus) can guide the op￾erator for optimal deployment. The height of the ring is
10 mm, and the upper edge of ring and stent are at the
same level. After the three “feelers” of rings are placed at
the three aortic sinuses, the correct position of the pro￾thesis below the coronary ostia was determined. The
bottom edges of stent are designed 5 mm lower than the
bottom edges out-ring (Fig. 7), which allows the bottom
of stent to be precisely implantated 5 mm lower than the
aortic sinus. This design can effectively reduce the risk
of atrioventricular block. Compared with the JenaValve,
the main body of ChenValve is a balloon-expanding
cobalt-chromium alloy stent. The advantage of balloon￾expanding stent is that the length is shorter than that of
the self-expanding stent, and a smaller part of the stent
is prominent to the left ventricular outflow tract. This
design can effectively abrogate the occurrence of atrio￾ventricular block. The diameter of ring is 2–3 mm

smaller than that of the stent. Once the stent is ex￾panded, the stent can be deployed within the outer-ring
to sandwich the native aortic leaflets in between, in favor
of prosthesis stabilization and reducing the occurrence
of dislodgement and perivalvular leakage. Another dis￾tinctive design, the three V-shape Nitinol alloy connect￾ing threads would be straightened into “一” shape, so
that the ring would be stretched above the stent after
prothesis is compressed (Fig. 8), which allows the profile
of prothesis to become much smaller, in favor of delivery
with smaller sheath (20F). The design of the skirt is
intended to prevent paravalvular. In out study, no mass
or moderate perivalvular leakage were observed.
Before the chen-valve was expanded, ventricular tem￾porary rapid pacing (250–300 beats/min) was used to
slow down the velocity of blood flow from the left ven￾tricle and reduce the dynamic amplitudes in the aorta,
to ensure that the implantation position of prosthesis is
accurate. The Nitinol alloy outer-ring of prosthesis is
not a solid anchoring structure. In addition to looking at
the image, the precise positioning also depends on the
hand feeling of the operator during prosthesis positioning.
Many ARs are frequently related to the dilation of aortic
root. Dilation of sinuses and sino-tubular junction may be
an intense obstacle for TAVI. In this study, it has not been
proven whether the chen-valve is suitable for AR, since
dilation of aortic root is not proved in this research.
According to the characteristics of the chen-valve, it is
possible to implant the Chen valve through the transfe￾moral route, and we will confirm this hypothesis in fur￾ther studies.
Our study is the first report to evaluate the composite
ChenValve prosthesis in vivo test. The ChenValve pros￾thesis is only available for implantation via the transapi￾cal approach. This study still has limitations. First, the
number of study animals is small and a larger study
samples are needed to confirmed the results. In addition,
the experimental animals are healthy goats instead of

AR model. Moreover, the patients with AR have a more
complex and variable anatomy.
Conclusion
This initial trial using the novel double-layer ChenValve
prosthesis demonstrated the feasibility of of TAVI in non￾calcified aortic valve. The mechanism of Nitinol ring￾guided locating of the aortic sinus enables anatomically
corrent positioning and seems to make the TAVI process
safe and reproducible in noncalcified aortic valve.
