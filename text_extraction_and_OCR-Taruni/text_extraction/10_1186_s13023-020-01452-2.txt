Abstract
Background: Macrophages play a significant role in liver disease development and progression. The macrophage
activation marker soluble (s)CD163 is associated with severity and prognosis in a number of different acute and
chronic liver diseases but has been only sparsely examined in Wilson’s disease (WD). We investigated sCD163 levels
in patients with acute and chronic WD and hypothesized associations with liver disease phenotype and
biochemical markers of liver injury.
Methods: We investigated sCD163 in two independent cohorts of WD patients: 28 patients with fulminant WD
from the US Acute Liver Failure (ALF) Study Group registry and 147 patients with chronic disease from a German
WD registry. We included a control group of 19 healthy individuals. Serum sCD163 levels were measured by ELISA.
Liver CD163 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry.
Results: In the ALF cohort, median sCD163 was 10-fold higher than in healthy controls (14.6(2.5–30.9) vs. 1.5(1.0–
2.7) mg/L, p < 0.001). In the chronic cohort, median sCD163 was 2.6(0.9–24.9) mg/L. There was no difference in
sCD163 according to subgroups based on initial clinical presentation, i.e. asymptomatic, neurologic, hepatic, or
mixed. Patients with cirrhosis at the time of diagnosis had higher sCD163 compared with those without cirrhosis
(3.0(1.2–24.9) vs. 2.3(0.9–8.0) mg/L, p < 0.001); and both cohorts significantly lower than the ALF patients. Further,
sCD163 correlated positively with ALT, AST, GGT and INR (rho = 0.27–0.53); and negatively with albumin (rho =
− 0.37), (p ≤ 0.001, all). We observed immunohistochemical CD163 expression in liver tissue from ALF patients.
Conclusions: Although sCD163 is not specific for WD, it was elevated in WD patients, especially in those with ALF.
Further, sCD163 was higher in patients with cirrhosis compared to patients without cirrhosis and associated with
biochemical markers of liver injury and hepatocellular function. Thus, macrophage activation is evident in WD and
associates with liver disease phenotype and biochemical parameters of liver disease. Our findings suggest that
sCD163 may be used as a marker of liver disease severity in WD patients.

Background
Wilson’s disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive inher￾ited disorder of copper metabolism resulting from muta￾tions in the ATP7B gene. The gene encodes the ATP7B
protein that mediates the build-in of copper in cerulo￾plasmin and/or excretion of excess copper into the bile.
Dysfunction of ATP7B causes copper accumulation in
the body, particularly in the liver and brain [1]. The clin￾ical presentation of WD can vary widely and the most
common clinical presentations are neuropsychiatric or
hepatic disease either alone or mixed while asymptom￾atic patients are typically detected by family screening.
The manifestations of liver disease range from an
asymptomatic state with only abnormal liver function
tests to cirrhosis and even life-threatening acute liver
failure. WD is fatal if left untreated [2–4]. While most
treatments arrest the development of neurological symp￾toms, slow progression of liver disease to cirrhosis is not
uncommon [5]. Liver function tests like alanine amino￾transferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
are used to monitor progression of liver disease [3], but
seems to be of questionable value [6–8]. In this situation
a reliable biomarker for progression of liver disease is
needed.
The pathogenesis of hepatocyte injury in WD is still
incompletely understood [9]. The liver pathology of WD
is highly variable and range from steatosis, glycogenated
nuclei in hepatocytes and focal hepatocellular necrosis
to chronic hepatitis, and cirrhosis [10]. With progression
of disease, mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates develop
and Kupffer cell hyperplasia and macrophage activation
is present, especially in advanced cases with fibrosis and
cirrhosis [10]. Macrophages may be activated by diverse
stimuli, e.g., via pathogen-associated molecular patterns
(PAMPs) or damage-associated molecular patterns
(DAMPs) from injured hepatocytes [11]. To which ex￾tend the activation of macrophages is involved in the
pathogenesis of WD remains unknown.
In a number of other liver diseases, activation of
macrophages plays an important role in the development
of liver inflammation, fibrosis and portal hypertension
[12–14]. CD163, the hemoglobin-haptoglobin scavenger
receptor, is lineage specific and expressed on the cell
surface of macrophages and to some extent on mono￾cytes. Upon macrophage activation, CD163 is shed and
can be detected in the blood as soluble (s)CD163 [15]
and used as a circulating biomarker of macrophage acti￾vation. We have previously shown that sCD163 is ele￾vated in patients with a variety of inflammatory liver
diseases with increasing levels dependent on liver disease
severity from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [16],
chronic viral hepatitis [17], autoimmune hepatitis [18]
and alcoholic hepatitis [19]. We also demonstrated clear
associations between sCD163, liver disease severity
(Child-Pugh and MELD scores), and portal hyperten￾sion in patients with cirrhosis [20]. Furthermore,
sCD163 increased in a stepwise manner in patients
with increasing grades of acute-on-chronic liver fail￾ure [21]; however, the highest levels are observed in
patients with acute liver failure (ALF) [22].
A pilot study from our laboratory suggested that
sCD163 was elevated in WD patients and may be a bio￾marker of progression of liver disease [23]. In the
present study, we aimed to investigate macrophage acti￾vation by sCD163 serum levels in a larger group of pa￾tients with WD and different liver disease phenotypes
ranging from chronic liver disease to ALF.
Materials and methods
Patients
We investigated 28 patients with WD from the US
Acute Liver Failure (ALF) Study Group registry and
147 patients with WD from a German WD registry
including patients with chronic WD in a retrospective
cohort study. We used a control group of 19 healthy
individuals [19].
In the US ALF cohort, 24 patients met ALF criteria of
coagulopathy (International normalized ratio (INR) >
1.5) and any degree of hepatic encephalopathy and four
patients presented with severe acute liver injury (ALI). It
is understood that although fulminant WD presents as a
newly diagnosed condition with rapid onset liver failure
most if not all such patients have underlying cirrhosis.
After informed consent was obtained from next of kin,
detailed prospective clinical and laboratory data were en￾tered in anonymous fashion into case report forms at
admission to study and 3 weeks later, or at time of death
or liver transplantation. Blood samples for sCD163
analyses were collected at day 1–7 and information on
21-day mortality was recorded. The study met all re￾quirements of Institutional Review Boards at the respect￾ive study sites.
In the German cohort of 147 chronic patients the
diagnosis of WD was established according to standard
criteria [5, 24]. The ATP7B mutational analysis was per￾formed as previously described [25, 26] in 100 of the 147
WD patients. Data on initial presentation were recorded
and patients categorized into subgroups on the basis of
symptoms present at the time of diagnosis: asymptom￾atic, neurologic, hepatic, or mixed presentation. No
patient presented with ALF. The presence of Kayser–
Fleischer rings was recorded. Cirrhosis was diagnosed by
histology or on the presence of typical findings in
imaging in combination with clinical signs of portal
hypertension (splenomegaly, ascites or esophageal vari￾ces). Thirty patients (20%) were diagnosed by family
screening. Blood samples for sCD163 determination and
standard biochemical analyses were collected between
Glavind et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases (2020) 15:173 Page 2 of 9

January 2011 and June 2016, which was median 15 years
(range = 0–50 years) after establishment of the WD diag￾nosis. Two patients (1%) were treatment naive and 145
patients (99%) were prescribed medicine for WD at the
time of blood sample collection. The majority of patients
were treated with a chelating agent, i.e. penicillamine or
trientine (n = 116; 80%), and the minority with either
zinc (n = 14; 10%) or a combination of a chelating agent
and zinc (n = 11; 8%). In a few patients the type of
medication was unknown (n = 4; 3%). Current medical
treatment was also first-line treatment in 66 patients
(46%). The median time under current medical treat￾ment prior to blood sampling was 76 months (range =
0–547 months). Twenty-two patients were in the early
phase of treatment, i.e. less than or equal to 12 months
(median 3 months), and 123 patients beyond 12 months
of treatment (median 104 months). All patients signed
informed consent before participation in the study in ac￾cordance with the Helsinki Declaration, and the local
Ethics Committee approved the study.
The historical healthy control group consisted of 9
females and 10 males with a median age of 44 years
(range = 31–64 years).
Biochemical analyses
The serum sCD163 levels were determined in duplicates
in samples that had been frozen at − 80 °C by an in-house
sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA)
using a BEP-2000 ELISA analyser (Dade Behring, Deer￾field, IL, USA), as previously described [15]. Using the
same assay, we have previously measured sCD163 in a
large cohort (n = 240) of healthy subjects (median = 1.7
mg/L, reference interval = 0.7–3.9 mg/L) [27].
Immunohistochemistry
Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue from
explanted liver tissue and core needle liver biopsies from
8 randomly selected WD patients from the US ALF co￾hort were obtained, and 4 μm sections were cut and
mounted onto slides. All slides were stained with a
CD163 antibody (clone MRQ-26 from Ventana Medical
System Inc., Tucson, Arizona USA) as a ready-to-use
formula with a dilution of 0,23 μl/ml. Pre-treatment was
performed including incubation of the unstained slides
for 4 min at temp. 72 °C, following rinse with EZ Prep
(Ventana Medical Systems) and incubation with Cell
Conditioner for 16–22 min. Incubation with the primary
antibody was performed at temp. 36 °C for 24 min. Auto￾mated staining with Bench Mark Ultra nr. 233,378,
Ventana Medical System Inc., Tucson, Arizona USA was
applied. Nuclear counterstaining with Mayer’s
hematoxylin was performed and the slides were cover￾slipped using the Tissue-Tek Prisma & Tissue-Tek Film
(Sakura Finetek Europe B.V., Alphen aan den Rijn, The
Netherlands). Positive controls included liver tissue, ap￾pendix and tonsil.
Semiquantitative evaluation was performed with an es￾timation of the overall expression of CD163 cells
throughout the entire slide applying a scale from 0 to 3.
The value 0 indicated no CD163 positive cells in the
slide, 1 low density of CD163 positive cells with only
very few cell-cell contacts, 2 moderate density of CD163
positive cells with more frequent cell-cell contacts, and 3
indicating high density of CD163 positive cells with
many cell-cell contacts. Please see Supplementary Infor￾mation for histology pictures illustrating the scoring al￾gorithm. The samples were scored individually by two
trained liver pathologists, and in cases of disagreement
the samples were reviewed under a double-headed
microscope and consensus was obtained.
Digital evaluation was performed applying an in-house
customized CD163 targeted application on scanned
slides. The slides were scanned using a Nano Zoomer
slide scanner (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Japan) using
40 times resolution. The application designed, using the
VIS program from Visiopharm (Visiopharm, Hørsholm,
Denmark), was customized to estimate the area fraction
(%) of CD163 positivity in the entire scanned slide.
Statistical analysis
Differences between groups were assessed by unpaired t￾tests (parametric, continuous variables) or Wilcoxon
rank-sum tests (non-parametric, continuous variables).
The assumption of normality was checked using
quantile-quantile plots and histograms and we used
logarithmic transformation to ensure a normal distribu￾tion where appropriate. The Kruskal-Wallis test was
used for more than two groups, and significant results
were further analysed. Changes within each group were
assessed by Wilcoxon singed-rank test. Fisher’s exact test
was used to assess differences in proportions. The Spear￾man rank-order correlation coefficient (rho) was used to
estimate the associations between sCD163 and biochem￾ical markers of liver injury, hepatocellular function and
WD specific markers. We performed multiple logistic re￾gression analysis to investigate the relationship between
sCD163 and cirrhosis adjusting for demographic and
biochemical parameters associated with cirrhosis and
disease severity (age, gender, ALT, bilirubin, albumin,
INR, creatinine). All continuous variables were logarith￾mically transformed. To identify candidate variables for
a new CD163-based cirrhosis score we performed back￾ward elimination based on the multiple logistic regres￾sion analysis with a significance limit of 0.1 with
inclusion of significant parameters in the score. Non￾parametric receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) ana￾lysis was used to assess the performance of sCD163 and
of the CD163-based cirrhosis score in the prediction of
Glavind et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases (2020) 15:173 Page 3 of 9

liver cirrhosis and the two were compared using the test
of equality of ROC areas. The Youden index method
was used to determine the optimal cut-off value. Data
are expressed as medians (ranges) for continuous vari￾ables and total number (%) for categorical variables ex￾cept when otherwise specified. P-values ≤0.05 were
considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was
performed using Stata 12.1 software from Stata Corpor￾ation (College Station, TX, USA).
Results
Patient characteristics
Demographic and biochemical data for both patient co￾horts are provided in Table 1. On admission in the US
ALF cohort, 17 patients had hepatic coma grade I or II,
and 11 patients had grade III or IV hepatic encephalop￾athy; maximum hepatic encephalopathy was I or II in 8
patients, whereas 20 patients had maximum grade III or
IV hepatic encephalopathy. In the German chronic co￾hort, 18 patients (12%) were asymptomatic, 20 patients
(14%) had neurologic presentation, 77 patients (52%)
hepatic, and 32 patients (22%) mixed hepatic and neuro￾logic. Cirrhosis was diagnosed in 3/18 of the asymptom￾atic, 1/20 of the neurologic, 23/77 of the hepatic, and
13/32 of the patients with mixed presentation. Thus, in
total, 40 patients (27%) had cirrhosis at diagnosis.
Seventy patients (48%) presented with Kayser–Fleischer
ring/rings.
CD163 in healthy controls
The median (range) plasma sCD163 in the 19 healthy
controls was 1.5 (1.0–2.7) mg/L and similar to the nor￾mal values of our laboratory.
CD163 in ALF WD patients
In the US ALF cohort, baseline (i.e. day 1, n = 18; day 2,
n = 10) sCD163 was 10-fold higher than in healthy
controls (14.6 (2.5–30.9) mg/L vs. 1.5 (1.0–2.7) mg/L,
p < 0.001) (Fig. 1). Out of 28 patients in the ALF cohort,
21 (75%) including two ALI patients received a liver
transplant within 21 days of enrolment and 6 patients
(21%) died, two after transplantation. Three patients
(11%) including two ALI patients were spontaneous sur￾vivors at day 21. There was no difference in sCD163
levels between the ALI and ALF patients (15.2 (10.0–
15.5) mg/L vs. 14.2 (2.5–30.9) mg/L, p = 0.75). The
sCD163 levels at baseline were similar between the
spontaneous survivors and the patients who received a
liver transplant or died (14.1 (10.0–15.0) mg/L vs. 15.3
(2.5–30.9) mg/L, p = 0.55). Among the spontaneous sur￾vivors, sCD163 did not significantly change between
baseline and last available measurement between day 4–
7 (data not shown). There was no correlation between

sCD163 and ALT, AST, bilirubin, albumin, INR, cerulo￾plasmin or 24-h urinary copper excretion. Immunohisto￾chemical CD163 expression was observed in the liver
tissue from WD patients from the US ALF cohort
(Fig. 2). The semiquantitative score was 2.5 [1–3], none
were graded 0, and the estimated area fraction of CD163
positivity was 4.5 (0.4–12.5).
CD163 in chronic WD patients
In the German chronic cohort, sCD163 was almost 2-
fold higher than in healthy controls (2.6 (0.9–24.9) mg/
L, p < 0.001) but significantly lower than in ALF patients
(p < 0.001) (Fig. 1). There was no difference in sCD163
levels according to subgroups based on initial
presentation (asymptomatic, neurologic, hepatic, or
mixed), but patients with cirrhosis at the time of
diagnosis had higher sCD163 levels compared with pa￾tients without cirrhosis (3.0 (1.2–24.9) mg/L vs. 2.3
(0.9–8.0) mg/L, p < 0.001) (Fig. 1). Patients with cirrhosis
had lower levels of albumin (p < 0.01), urea (p < 0.01)
and WBC count (p < 0.05) and higher levels of INR (p <
0.001) compared with patients without cirrhosis.
Further, patients with cirrhosis tended to be older (p =
0.06) and having higher levels of bilirubin (p = 0.06) and
lower levels of serum copper (p = 0.09) compared with
patients without cirrhosis.

There was no difference in sCD163 levels between pa￾tients with or without the point mutation H1069Q in
one allele or both alleles (data not shown). Also, there
was no difference between those with and without
Kayser-Fleisher ring (data not shown).
Patients on current medical treatment for WD for more
than 12 months had lower sCD163 levels compared with
those treated for less than 12 months (2.5 (0.9–9.6) mg/L
vs. 3.5 (1.7–24.9) mg/L, p = 0.02) (Fig. 3). Also, those with
longer treatment duration were older and had lower levels
of ALT, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), and urinary
copper (p < 0.05–0.001) (Supplementary Table 1). Regard￾ing type of medication, i.e. a chelating agent, zinc or the
combination, patients treated with zinc had lower sCD163
levels compared with those treated with a chelating agent
(2.0 (1.3–3.1) mg/L vs. 2.7 (0.9–24.9) mg/L, p < 0.001),
while there was no difference in sCD163 levels between
the other treatment groups (Fig. 4). Further, there was no
significant difference in treatment duration under the
current medication between treatment groups (data not
shown).
In the chronic cohort, sCD163 correlated positively
with ALT (rho = 0.27), AST (rho = 0.53), GGT (rho =
0.48) and INR (rho = 0.41); and negatively with albumin
(rho = − 0.37) (p ≤ 0.001, all). There was no correlation
between sCD163 and bilirubin, ceruloplasmin or 24-h
urinary copper excretion.
Regression analysis for cirrhosis prediction using sCD163
in chronic WD patients
The multiple logistic regression analysis showed that
sCD163 was not an independent predictor of cirrhosis.
However, after a backward elimination procedure,
sCD163, ALT and INR were independent variables in
the final model (Supplementary Table 2) and included in
a CD163-ALT-INR cirrhosis score:
CD163-ALT-INR = 0.91 * log sCD163 (mg/L) - 1.13 *
log ALT (U/L) + 12.14 * log INR.
In non-parametric ROC analysis, sCD163 and the
CD163-ALT-INR cirrhosis score predicted cirrhosis with
an area under the ROC curve of 0.69 (95% confidence
interval (CI): 0.59–0.79) and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.71–0.88),
respectively (p = 0.02). The optimal cut-off value was at
CD163-ALT-INR = − 2.19 (sensitivity = 69%, specificity =
81%, NPV = 87%, PPV = 59%).
Discussion
This is the first study to investigate macrophage activa￾tion by sCD163 in a large sample of WD patients pre￾senting with either ALF or chronic disease. Soluble
CD163 was elevated in WD and with the highest levels
in WD patients with ALF where immunohistochemical
CD163-staining confirmed the presence of activated
macrophages in the liver. In the chronic cohort sCD163
correlated with markers of liver injury and hepatocellular

function and was higher in patients with cirrhosis than
in those without cirrhosis at the time of diagnosis. Fur￾ther, those with longer duration of treatment had lower
sCD163 and improved liver function tests indicating bet￾ter control of the liver disease. Our observations contrib￾ute to evidence that macrophage activation is important
for the development of liver disease in WD and may
suggest that sCD163 can be used as a marker of liver
disease severity in WD patients.
The major strength of the present study is the large
number of WD patients included from two different
registries and the broad spectrum of liver disease pheno￾types represented, ranging from the asymptomatic pa￾tient with only biochemical abnormalities to cirrhosis
and also ALF. Study limitations include the use of a his￾torical control group but sCD163 in that group (1.5
(1.0–2.7) mg/L) was similar to the normal values in the
laboratory (1.7 mg/L (reference interval = 0.7–3.9 mg/L)
based on 240 individuals [27]. Further, it is a limitation
that time of initial diagnosis and blood sampling was
separated in time. We therefore cannot be sure if the pa￾tients presenting with cirrhosis at diagnosis also had cir￾rhosis when the blood samples were taken. Finally, the
major part of the study is cross-sectional which limits
the causality aspects; however, we do provide follow-up
measurements on sCD163 and data on day-21 mortality
in patients from the US ALF cohort.
Compared with our previous study on sCD163 in ALF,
sCD163 levels were lower (14.6 (2.5–30.9) mg/L) in our
patients with WD and ALF than in patients with ALF
due to acetaminophen, drugs, indeterminate or other
unspecified reasons (median 21.1 mg/L) [22]. The
sCD163 levels in the US cohort of patients with WD and
ALF were similar to those previously presented in hospi￾talized patients with alcoholic hepatitis (median 15.4 mg/
L) [19]. These data suggest massive activation of hepatic
macrophages in the ALF situation, as also supported by
the histological examination. The observed sCD163
levels in the patients from the German cohort with
chronic WD were in agreement with our previous find￾ings in a smaller pilot study [23]. In the large German
cohort, sCD163 was not significantly different among
clinical presentations: Asymptomatic, neurologic, hep￾atic, and mixed. There was no association between
sCD163 and the presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings, the
levels of serum ceruloplasmin or of urinary copper. Nei￾ther did we see an association with the H1069Q muta￾tion and sCD163 but associations between genotype and
clinical presentation are in general scarce in WD [28,
29]. At the same time, sCD163 levels were elevated in
patients with cirrhosis independent of the clinical pre￾sentations. Our findings do not indicate that sCD163 is
a marker for WD per se but instead suggest that macro￾phage activation and elevated sCD163 levels in WD

reflect liver disease severity. This is in accordance with
studies in other liver diseases [20, 30, 31].
Interestingly, patients pharmacologically treated for
WD for less than 12 months had higher sCD163 levels
than patients on long-term treatment suggesting a treat￾ment effect with improved liver disease and reduced
macrophage activation as observed in patients with
chronic viral hepatitis [17, 32] or non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease [33]. In addition, patients treated with zinc
had lower sCD163 levels compared to chelating agents,
which may suggest differences in treatment effects on
macrophage activation. Of interest, CD163 is shed into
the plasma on Toll-like receptor activation and parallels
the response of tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) to
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [27]. Zinc supplementation in￾hibits the LPS-induced hepatic release of TNF-α [34]
and may in a similar way inhibit LPS-induced CD163
shedding partly explaining the lower sCD163 levels in
zinc treated patients. However, no firm conclusions can
be drawn based on our data and further studies are
needed. The difference in sCD163 levels in treatment
groups may also reflect selection bias since patients with
elevated levels of ALT may change treatment from zinc
to a chelating agent.
Soluble CD163 in the German chronic WD cohort
correlated to biochemical markers of liver injury and he￾patocellular function, while such correlations were not
found in the US ALF cohort. This may indicate differ￾ences in the pathophysiological role for sCD163 in the
two cohorts. In ALF due to WD ALT is only moderately
elevated, and alkaline phosphatase surprisingly low [35],
so these markers of liver injury develop differently in
ALF due to WD than in other types of ALF. In accord￾ance, in a larger sample of ALF patients of mixed origins
sCD163 was in fact correlated to the liver function tests
[22]. It may be speculated that in ALF patients, macro￾phage activation and sCD163 shedding may be caused
by the massive hepatic necrosis with production of
DAMPs. In contrast, in WD patients with chronic liver
disease both DAMPs but also PAMPs including endo￾toxin and LPS from a leaky gut in patients with portal
hypertension may be involved. Further, copper may itself
be involved in macrophage activation and sCD163 shed￾ding [36].
The severity of WD in the individual patient depends
on the heterogenic expression of the range of symptoms
such as neurological, psychiatric, hepatic, haemolysis
and others. Most of these will not be reflected in
sCD163. However, monitoring of liver disease progres￾sion and cirrhosis development in WD patients is a spe￾cific clinical challenge. As a single marker sCD163
predicted liver cirrhosis with modest accuracy with
AUROC of 0.69. Using multiple logistic regression ana￾lysis with backward elimination the combination of
sCD163, ALT and INR into a CD163-ALT-INR cirrhosis
score resulted in a higher AUROC of 0.80. This score
may represent a most needed tool for the non-invasive
monitoring of disease progression and cirrhosis develop￾ment in patients with WD but it needs validation in in￾dependent cohorts and with liver biopsy as gold
standard.
Conclusions
In conclusion, sCD163 was elevated in WD patients, es￾pecially in those with ALF. Further, sCD163 levels were
higher in patients with cirrhosis compared to those with￾out cirrhosis at the time of diagnosis, and associated
with biochemical markers of liver injury and hepatocel￾lular function. In patients with more than 1 year of
treatment duration sCD163 levels were lower than in
those with shorter duration. Thus macrophage activation
is evident in WD and associates with the liver disease
phenotype and biochemical parameters of liver disease.
Our results indicate that sCD163 may reflect the liver
disease severity in WD patients. Whether sCD163 could
be a biomarker of progression of liver disease in WD
should be examined and validated in larger prospective
liver biopsy verified cohorts.
