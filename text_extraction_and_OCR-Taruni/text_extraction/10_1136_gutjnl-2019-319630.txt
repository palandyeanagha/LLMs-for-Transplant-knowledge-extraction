Significance of this study
What is already known on this study?
► The intestinal bacterial profile of patients with 
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) differs from that 
of healthy subjects.
► The low bacterial diversity (dysbiosis) in 
patients with IBS might contribute to the 
pathophysiology of IBS.
► Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has 
been investigated in two previous double-blind,
placebo-controlled studies. One of those studies 
found improvement of the IBS symptoms, 
whereas the other found no effect.
What are the new findings?
► FMT is an effective treatment for IBS that 
improves abdominal symptoms, fatigue and 
quality of life.
► The use of a superdonor is necessary for 
successful FMT.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the 
foreseeable future?
► This study demonstrates the effectiveness of 
FMT in the treatment of IBS.
► The use of frozen faeces administered via a 
gastroscope makes FMT easy to perform in the 
clinic.
Abstract
Objective Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from 
healthy donors to patients with irritable bowel syndrome 
(IBS) has been attempted in two previous double-blind,
placebo-controlled studies. While one of those studies 
found improvement of the IBS symptoms, the other 
found no effect. The present study was conducted to 
clarify these contradictory findings.
Design This randomised, double-blind, placebo￾controlled study randomised 165 patients with IBS
to placebo (own faeces), 30 g FMT or 60 g FMT at 
a ratio of 1:1:1. The material for FMT was obtained 
from one healthy, well-characterised donor, frozen and 
administered via gastroscope. The primary outcome was 
a reduction in the IBS symptoms at 3 months after FMT 
(response). A response was defined as a decrease of 
50 or more points in the total IBS symptom score. The 
secondary outcome was a reduction in the dysbiosis 
index (DI) and a change in the intestinal bacterial profile, 
analysed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, at 1month 
following FMT.
Results Responses occurred in 23.6%, 76.9% 
(p<0.0001) and 89.1% (p<00.0001) of the patients who 
received placebo, 30 g FMT and 60 g FMT, respectively. 
These were accompanied by significant improvements in 
fatigue and the quality of life in patients who received 
FMT. The intestinal bacterial profiles changed also 
significantly in the groups received FMT. The FMT adverse 
events were mild self-limiting gastrointestinal symptoms.
Conclusions FMT is an effective treatment for patients 
with IBS. Utilising a well-defined donor with a normal DI
and favourable specific microbial signature is essential 
for successful FMT. The response to FMT increases with 
the dose.

Introduction
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a relatively 
common gastrointestinal disorder with an estimated 
prevalence of 11.2% in the global population.1 2
Although IBS does not increase mortality, it reduces 
the quality of life considerably.1 2 The aetiology 
of IBS is not completely understood, and there is 
no effective treatment for the condition.1
 The gut 
microbiota in patients with IBS differs from that 
of the healthy subjects, including exhibiting a low 
bacterial diversity (dysbiosis).1 3–5 It is believed that 
microbiota dysbiosis is one of the factors contrib￾uting to the aetiology of IBS.1
The application of faecal microbiota transplan￾tation (FMT) in several open-label trials with small 
cohorts of patients with IBS has produced good 
results.1
 One recent randomised double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study of FMT found positive 
results for FMT, whereas another found no effect.6 7
The present study was carried out to resolve these 
contradictory findings.

baseline visit, the patients provided a faecal sample and were 
asked to complete five questionnaires to assess their abdominal 
symptoms, fatigue and quality of life. At the second visit, the 
patients provided a faecal sample and completed a new set of 
questionnaires. The patients also completed similar sets of ques￾tionnaires at 2 weeks and 3 months after FMT, and returned 
them by post. The patients were asked to keep a diary to record 
bowel habits and register any adverse events. Polyethylene glycol 
and loperamide were allowed during the intervention as rescue 
medication. The frequency of using these rescue medications in 
the three intervention groups was not recorded.
Enrolment and randomisation of patients
Randomisation
The patients were randomised to the placebo (30g of their own 
faeces), 30g FMT and 60g FMT groups at a ratio of 1:1:1 in 
blocks of six using a Web-based system (http://www.randomiza￾tion.com) by a nurse who was not involved in the trial (figure 1). 
The patients delivered two faecal samples at the start of the 
trial to the same nurse: one was used for gut bacterial analysis 
in all patients, while the other was either used for transplan￾tation (in patients randomised to placebo) or discarded (in 
patients randomised to ‘superdonor’ FMT, as described later). 
The researcher who prepared the transplant was not aware of 
the identity of the faecal sample used for transplantation. The 
patients and researchers involved in the study were blinded to 
the randomisation. The randomisation key was revealed to the 
researcher and patients after the trial had ended.
Patients
Patients who fulfilled the Rome IV criteria for the diagnosis of 
IBS without red flags were recruited from those attending the 
outpatient clinic at Stord Hospital. All of the patients had been 
experiencing IBS symptoms for a long time (mean=17 years, 
range=9–25 years), and the onset of symptoms had not been 
associated with gastrointestinal or other infections. The medical 
history was obtained for all patients, and they underwent a 
complete physical examination as well as blood tests for full 
blood count, electrolytes and inflammatory markers including 
faecal calprotectin, liver tests and thyroid function tests. They 
also underwent a gastroscopy with duodenal biopsies and a colo￾noscopy with segmental biopsies to exclude other gastrointes￾tinal diseases.
The patients had not previously consumed a low-fermentable 
oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols diet. All of the recruited 
patients adhered to a diet consistent with the modified guide￾lines of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
(NICE) at least for 3 months, which did not result in a marked 
improvement in symptoms, including in the bowel habit, abdom￾inal pain or abdominal bloating/distension. These patients were 
considered as non-responders to a NICE-modified diet,8
 and 
they stopped consuming that diet on entering the trial. They 
underwent a 12-hour course of IBS treatment lasting 2 days 
that provided with information delivered by a gastroenterolo￾gist, specialist nurse, psychiatrist, dietitian and physiotherapist.9
The patients’ symptoms improved slightly after participating in 
the course, which is consistent with previously published data 
related to a similar course.9
The following inclusion criteria were applied:
1. Aged 18–85 years.
2. Moderate-to-severe IBS symptoms, as indicated by a score of 
≥175 on the IBS Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS).
The exclusion criteria were as follows:
1. Presence of systemic disease, immune deficiency or treat￾ment with immune-modulating medication.
2. Pregnant, planning pregnancy or lactating.
3. Having undergone any abdominal surgery, with the excep￾tion of appendectomy, cholecystectomy, caesarean section 
and hysterectomy.
4. Severe psychiatric disorder, or alcohol or drug abuse.
5. Use of probiotics or treatment with antibiotics within 8 
weeks prior to study entry.
6. Use of IBS medication within the previous 3 months, with 
the exception of polyethylene glycol and loperamide.

Gut microbiota
Figure 2 Although the superdonor was normobiotic, his bacterial profile deviated from the expected normal abundance in 14 of the 39 bacteria 
markers. The deviating bacteria belong to the typical commensal bacteria species that do not contribute to dysbiosis. In all, 12 of these bacteria belong 
to the phylum Firmicutes (grey), one to the phylum Proteobacteria (light green) and one to the phylum Verrucomicrobia (light blue).
Donor
A single superdonor was recruited and screened according to the 
European guidelines for donors for FMT.1 10 This involved inter￾viewing him to obtain his medical history and lifestyle habits 
to exclude any exposure to infectious agents or risky social 
or sexual behaviour such as drug abuse. He also underwent a 
physical examination as well as blood tests to exclude gastroin￾testinal, metabolic or neurological disorders (full blood count, 
blood glucose, electrolytes and inflammatory markers), liver 
tests and thyroid function tests. Serology screening tests for HIV, 
syphilis and hepatitis A, B and C were also performed. Stool 
culturing was performed for pathogenic bacteria (Shigella spp., 
Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Yersinia spp. and toxin￾producing Clostridioides difficile). Rotavirus and stool ova and 
parasites were also examined. The findings of all of these tests 
and examinations were negative.
The donor was an athletic Caucasian male aged 36 years. He 
was a non-smoker, healthy, not taking any medication and had a 
BMI of 23.5kg/m2
. He was not related to any of the patients in 
the trial. His mother (a medical professional) confirmed that he 
was born via a vaginal delivery, breastfed and had been treated 
three times with antibiotics during his life. He trained for 1hour 
five times weekly. The MoBa Food Frequency Questionnaire 
was used to determine his frequency of consuming 225 food 
items grouped according to the Norwegian meal patterns over 
the previous 12 months, and his answers were analysed using 
software for nutrient calculations.11 The superdonor’s diet 
was within the normal range of those of 35 previously exam￾ined healthy subjects.11 However, the superdonor regularly 
took dietary supplements rich in proteins, vitamins, fibre and 
minerals (online supplementary table 1) that made his diet richer 
than average in those substances.
His microbiota in a faecal sample was analysed using the 
GA-map Dysbiosis Test (Genetic Analysis, Oslo, Norway),3
which revealed a dysbiosis index (DI) of 1, indicating normo￾biosysis. Despite the donor having a DI of 1, deviation from 
the expected normal abundance was observed in 14 of the 39 
bacteria markers. These deviating bacteria belong to the typical 
commensal bacteria species, and increases or decreases in their 
abundances are not considered to contribute to dysbiosis. In all, 
12 of the bacteria were in the phylum Firmicutes, with one each 
in the phyla Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia. The other 25 
more opportunistic bacteria markers that showed abundances 
similar to normal are important candidates in a dysbiotic condi￾tion (figure 2). The donor had donated his faeces in 18 months, 
and his faeces samples were tested every 3 months. The samples 
remained normobiotic, with only minor variations in the constit￾uent bacteria (figure 3).
Faecal sample collection, preparation and administration
Faecal samples from the superdonor and the patients were frozen 
immediately and kept at –20°C until they were delivered frozen 
to the laboratory on the same day. They were kept at –80°C in 
the laboratory, and thawed at 4°C for 2 days before transplan￾tation. On the day of transplantation, the faecal samples were 
weighed, and 30g and 60g portions were mixed with 40mL of 
sterile saline (0.9 NaCl), filtered through a 110 cm × 10 cm 
non-woven swab (One Med, Helsinki, Finland), drawn into 
50mL sterile syringes, sealed and kept at 4°C until the time of 
transplantation. Each transplant was administered to the distal 
duodenum via the working channel of a gastroscope, which was 
then flashed with another 40mL of sterile saline.
Measures
Abdominal symptoms, fatigue and quality of life
Abdominal symptoms were assessed using the IBS-SSS and 
the Birmingham IBS Symptom (Birmingham IBS-S) question￾naires.12 13 Fatigue was measured using the Fatigue Assessment 
Scale (FAS).14 Quality of life was measured using the IBS Quality 
of Life (IBS-QoL) and Short-Form Nepean Dyspepsia Index (SF￾NDI) questionnaires.15–17 Higher IBS-QoL and lower SF-NDI 
scores indicate a better quality of life.
Patients whose total IBS-SSS score decreased by ≥50 points 
after FMT were considered responders. A decrease of ≥175 
points in the IBS-SSS total score, a decrease of ≥4 points in the 
FAS score and an increase of ≥14 points in the IBS-QoL score 
were considered to indicate significant clinical improvements

in abdominal symptoms, fatigue and quality of life, respec￾tively.12 16 18 The responses were also analysed according to 
the European Medicines Agency and (EMA) and the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) using a composite responder 
endpoint.19 20 According to EMA, a responder should fulfil the 
response criteria for at least 50% of the observation time. The 
response criteria for IBS-D are an improvement at least 30% in 
the abdominal pain score and a 50% reduction in the number of 
days with at least one stool that that has consistency of 6 or seven 
as compared with the base line. The response criteria for IBS-C 
are a reduction at least 30% in the abdominal pain score and an 
increase of at least one complete spontaneous bowel movement 
per week as compared with the base line. In IBS-M, a responder 
is a patient who has at least 30% improvement in the abdominal 
pain score and a subjects global assessment of efficacy scale of 
the highest two improvement grades in a 7-point scale, or of the 
highest improvement grade in a 5-point scale as compared with 
the base line.
Faecal bacterial analysis
The faecal bacteria were analysed with the GA-map Dysbiosis 
Test using a method described in detail elsewhere.3 4 In brief, 
the test uses the 16S rRNA gene to determine both the bacterial 
profile and DI. It detects bacteria within five phyla (Firmicutes, 
Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Tenericutes and Verrucomicrobia) 
that cover 10 bacterial classes, 36 genera and 32 species,3
 which 
means that the test assesses >300 bacteria at different taxo￾nomic levels.4
 The DI is measured on a 5-point scale from 1 to 
5 (severe dysbiosis), where DI values>2 indicate the presence of 
dysbiosis.3
The GA-map Dysbiosis Test was also used to analyse the 
changes in the intestinal bacterial profile following transplanta￾tion, in which the bacterial abundance was quantified from –3 
to +3, where 0 represents the normal value based on a previous 
analysis of faecal samples of 297 healthy subjects.3
 In addition, 
principal component analysis (PCA) was used to plot scaled

within a group. The differences in the signals were analysed 
using the lmFit function in the limma package.21
Outcomes
The primary endpoint was a reduction in the IBS-SSS total score 
of ≥50 points at 3 months following transplantation,22 which 
the secondary endpoint was a change in the DI and intestinal 
bacterial profile.
Ethics
All subjects provided both oral and written consents to 
participate.
Statistical analysis
The sample size required in each arm of the trial was calcu￾lated by assuming that a placebo effect was 40% and an effect 
response was 80%. The total sample size was estimated to be 
60 patients, with 20 in each arm (α=0.05, 1–β=0.80). We 
intended to assess 200 patients for eligibility mainly because 
a previous study employing a similarly calculated sample size 
failed to show any benefit of FMT, and also to allow for drop￾outs.7
 Differences between the placebo, 30 g FMT and 60 g
FMT groups in age and in IBS-SSS, Birmingham IBS-S, FAS, 
IBS-QoL and SF-NDI scores were analysed using one-way
analysis of variance with Tukey’s multiple-comparisons test 
as a post-test. The differences between the placebo, 30 g FMT
and 60 g FMT groups in sex, overall responses, numbers of
included IBS subtypes, IBS-subtype responses, IBS-subtype
dysbiosis and IBS-subtype medications, and differences in 
responses with sex and IBS duration were analysed using the 
χ2
 test. The correlations between the changes in bacterial 
profile and the IBS-SSS and FAS scores were analysed using the 
non-parametric Spearman test. The paired t-test was used to
calculate the differences in the bacterial profile and DI in the 
placebo, 30 g FMT and 60 g FMT groups between before and
1 month after transplantation. Wilcoxon’s test was applied in 
PCA to test for differences in the placebo, 30 g FMT and 60 g
FMT before and 1 month after transplantation. These analyses 
were performed using GraphPad Prism (version 8, La Jolla, CA, 
USA). All authors had access to the study data and reviewed 
and approved the final manuscript.

Results
Patients and responses
In all, 200 patients were initially assessed for eligibility, of which 
164 patients completed the study (figure 1). The characteristics 
of these patients are summarised in table 1. Responses occurred 
after 3 months in 23.6%, 76.9% and 89.1% of the patients in the 
placebo, 30g FMT and 60g FMT groups, respectively (figure 4). 
There were significant response differences between 30g FMT 
and 60g FMT after 2 weeks, 1month and 3 months (figure 4). 
The response to FMT did not differ between the IBS subtypes. 
However, IBS-C (constipation-predominant IBS) and IBS-M 
(mixed-diarrhoea-and-constipation IBS) patients in the placebo 
group exhibited significantly larger responses after 1 and 3 
months (online supplementary table 2), which could have been 
at least partially due to the rescue medication used for constipa￾tion (polyethylene glycol) being more effective than that used for 
diarrhoea (loperamide). The responses in the placebo, 30g FMT 
and 60g FMT groups did not differ with sex (p=0.9, 0.5 and 
0.6, respectively) or between patients with IBS for ≥10and<10 
years (p=0.9, 0.8 and 0.7, respectively). The total IBS-SSS 
scores for diarrhoea-predominant IBS (IBS-D), IBS-C and IBS-M 
patients in the 30g FMT group at the endpoint of the trial (after 
3 months) were 157.7±83.2 (mean±SD), 207.9±114.7and 
204±125.5, respectively, with corresponding values in the 60g 
FMT group of 156.4±113.3, 189.2±123.0and 158.9±127.1. 
The total IBS-SSS score did not differ between the IBS-subtype 
patients who received 30g FMT and 60g FMT (p=0.260and 
0.652, respectively).
Abdominal symptoms, fatigue and quality of life
Abdominal symptoms as measured using IBS-SSS and 
Birmingham IBS-S were significantly improved after 3 months 
for both 30g FMT and 60g FMT compared with placebo 
(table 2 and online supplementary table 3), as was fatigue as 
assessed using FAS (table 3) and the quality of life as assessed 
using IBS-QoL and SF-NDI (table 4 and online supplementary 
table 4). In more detail, there were clinical improvements in 
abdominal symptoms in 5.5%, 35.2% and 47.3% of the patients 
in the placebo, 30g FMT and 60g FMT groups, respectively, in 
fatigue in 21.8%, 53.7% and 52.7% of them, and in the quality 
of life in 7.3%, 61.1% and 58.2% of them (online supplemen￾tary table 5). The responses according to EMA/FDA composite 
responder endpoint, 3 months after FMT were 16.7%, 50% and 
70.9% in the placebo, 30g and 60g groups, respectively. The 
responses in 30g and 60g groups versus placebo group were 
significant (p<0.0001, both). There was a significant difference 
in response between 30g and 60g groups (p=0.004).
Bacterial analysis
Some of the tubes containing faecal samples shattered during 
transportation to the laboratory for analysis, which resulted in 
the bacterial analyses of faecal samples before and after trans￾plantation only being performed on 47, 42 and 39 patients in 
the placebo, 30g FMT and 60g FMT groups, respectively. The 
DI values before transplantation were 2.6±1.1, 2.8±1.1and 
2.7±0.9 in the placebo, 30g FMT and 60g FMT groups, 
respectively; the corresponding values after transplantation were 
2.6±1.1, 2.6±1.1and 2.4±1.1 (p=0.087, 0.508 and 0.262). 
Dysbiosis was present in 57%, 55% and 61% of the patients in 
the placebo, 30g FMT and 60g FMT groups before transplan￾tation, respectively, in 53%, 50% and 39% of them after trans￾plantation (p=0.836, 0.828 and 0.108, respectively).
The analysis of the faecal bacterial profiles obtained using the 
GA-map Dysbiosis Test showed significant changes in the abun￾dance of bacteria in the 30g FMT and 60g FMT groups but not 
in the placebo group (online supplementary table 6). Alistipes
spp. were increased for both 30g FMT and 60g FMT. Bacte￾roides and Prevotella spp. increased in the 30g FMT group while 
Eubacterium hallii decreased, and Firmicutes spp. and Akker￾mansia muciniphila increased in the 60g FMT group, while 
Dorea spp. decreased.
PCA and the differences in signals analysed using the lmFit 
function in the limma package showed changes in the bacterial 
profiles after transplantation in the placebo, 30g FMT and 60g 
FMT groups as well as in the responder and non-responder groups 
(figure 5). The same approach showed that the responders in 
both the 30g FMT and 60g FMT groups had higher signals for 
Eubacterium biforme, Lactobacillus spp. and Alistipes spp. after 
transplantation, and lower signals for Bacteroides spp. (online 
supplementary figure 1). These changes occurred in responders 
in the 30g FMT and 60g FMT groups but not in the placebo 
group (online supplementary figures 2–5).
The IBS-SSS score was significantly correlated with the 
concentrations of Lactobacillus spp. (p=0.002, r=–0.3) and

Discussion
The findings of this study show that FMT is an effective treat￾ment for IBS that improves both the symptoms and quality of 
life regardless of the IBS subtype. About half of the patients 
experienced significant clinical improvements in abdominal 
symptoms, fatigue and quality of life. These improvements 
were accompanied by changes in the bacterial faecal profile 
but not in the DI. The clinical relevance of the dysbiosis has 
been questioned recently.4 23 It is notable that the scores in all 
IBS-QoL domains except for health worries improved after the 
patients received FMT. This is probably because the patients 
attended an IBS course prior to the trial, which is reported to 
improve the perceived knowledge of IBS.9
 The response to FMT 
increased with the dose. The adverse events of FMT were mild 
self-limiting gastrointestinal symptoms. It is noteworthy that a 
cohort of patients with IBS stated that they would give up an 
average of 15 years of their life (corresponding to 25% of their 
remaining lifespan) while 14% would risk a 1-in-1000 chance of 
death to receive a treatment that would make them free of IBS 
symptoms.24
At 1month following the FMT, higher concentrations of 
Eubacterium biforme, Lactobacillus spp. and Alistipes spp. and 
a lower concentration for Bacteroides spp. were observed in this 
study in both the 30g FMT and 60g FMT groups. The concen￾trations for Alistipes spp. and Lactobacillus spp. were inversely 
correlated with the IBS-SSS score, while the signal for Alistipes
spp. was inversely correlated with the FAS score. These findings 
indicate an association between the clinical improvement and 
the changes found in the bacterial profile following FMT in the 
present patients.
The finding that frozen faeces samples were effective in FMT 
confirms previous observations for FMT in Clostridioides diffi￾cile and in patients with IBS.6 25 Furthermore, administering the 
transplants via the upper gastrointestinal route with the aid of a 
gastroscope seems to work well. These observations would elim￾inate the logistical problems associated with both FMT involving 
fresh faeces and the bowel preparation needed for administering 
such a transplant to the colon. Moreover, it might be possible to 
establish faeces banks for the routine clinical use of FMT.
It is difficult to compare the findings of the present study with 
those of previously reported randomised placebo-controlled 
trials.6 7 due to differences in the sizes of the patient cohorts, the 
forms and amounts of the transplants, the routes of administra￾tion and the donors used. Johnsen et al investigated 83 patients 
with either IBS-D or IBS-M in whom 50–80g of a mixture of 
the faeces from two donors was introduced into the colon.6
Halkjaer et al included 51 patients with all IBS subtypes except 
unclassified IBS who received 50g of a mixture of faeces from 
four donors in a capsule form for 12 days (totalling 600g).7
In the present study, the response rate in the placebo group 
at 2 weeks after transplantation was 49.1%, which decreased 
to 24.5% after 1month and 23.6% after 3 months following 
transplantation. The placebo-group response in this study at 
3 months after transplantation was slightly lower than that of 
30% reported by Johnsen et al.
6
 This difference could be due 
to the present placebo group containing almost twice as many 
patients as in that previous study. Moreover, the patients in the 
study of Johnsen et al were subjected to bowel preparation and 
colonoscopy, which is often painful and takes more time than 
the gastroscopy applied in the present study. This aspect could 
have affected the expectations of the patients and increased the 
placebo effect. Halkjaer et al7
 used a reduction in the IBS-SSS 
score as the primary end point rather than a response based on 
a definition of such a reduction in IBS-SSS score, which makes it 
difficult to compare the response in their placebo group with the 
present observations.
The clinical efficacy of FMT is not affected by the choice of 
the donor in patients with Clostridioides difficile,
5 26 whereas 
the success of FMT in inflammatory bowel disease and other 
disorders is donor-dependent.5
 A new definition of superdonor 
has emerged for someone who is normobiotic and has a posi￾tive microbial signature, but an attempt to use stool pooling 
to produce a superdonor was not successful.5
 Two randomised 
double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of FMT in patients 
with IBS produced conflicting results, which might have been 
due to variability in the donor stools used.6 7
What constitutes a positive microbial signature in an IBS super￾donor remains unclear.5
 Therefore, when choosing the super￾donor in the present study, we had to consider the factors that 
might positively affect intestinal microbiota. Smoking/smoking 
cessation affects the gut microbiota negatively.27 28 To be born by 
caesarean section and/or be formula-fed affect the gut microbiota 
profile and reduce the bacterial diversity.29–32 Frequent treat￾ment with antibiotics and/or a regular intake of non-antibiotic 
drugs have negative effects on the gut microbiota.33–35 Regular 
exercise and consuming a sport-specific diet are known to be 
associated with a favourable gut microbiota.36–38 Furthermore, 
the superdonor should not be a first-degree relative of any of 
the patients in a trial since the intestinal microbiota is affected 
by the genetic composition, and a superdonor and recipient with 
greater genetic similarity may also have greater similarities in 
their faecal microbiota.39 40 Thus, among the several candidate 
donors that we screened, we chose a donor who was a non￾smoker, not taking any medication and had been treated only 
a few times with antibiotics. He was born via a vaginal delivery 
and breastfed, he trained regularly, consumed a sport-specific 
diet rich in protein and fibre, and was not related to any of the 
patients in the trial.
The present study utilised a single well-defined donor who 
was normobiotic with a bacterial signature that included an 
abundance of Streptococcus, Dorea, Lactobacillus and Rumino￾coccaceae spp. These four genera of bacteria have been reported 
to constitute favourable bacteria for a donor.5 41–43 Further 
studies involving well-defined donors are needed to identify 
their favourable bacterial signatures.
One strength of this clinical trial is that it involved a relatively 
large cohort of patients with IBS that included three of the IBS 
subtypes (including IBS-C) and used a single well-defined donor. 
Furthermore, it confirmed that frozen faeces samples obtained 
from a donor are effective in FMT, which facilitates their use 
in the clinic. However, the study also had limitations: it did not 
investigate the entire intestinal bacterial contents or the long￾term effects of FMT, and it did not record the frequency of using 
rescue medication in the intervention groups. A simultaneous 
weakness and strength of the study was that it investigated a 
cohort of patients that had moderate-to-severe IBS symptoms 
despite adhering to a diet consistent with the modified NICE 
diet. This is a weakness because the outcome cannot be applied 
to the entire IBS population, while it is a strength since it showed 
that FMT succeeded when diet failed.
