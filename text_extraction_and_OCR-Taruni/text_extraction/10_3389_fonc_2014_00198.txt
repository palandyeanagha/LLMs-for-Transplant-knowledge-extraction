Limited therapeutic options are available for hepatic malignancies. Image guided targeted
therapies have established their role in management of primary and secondary hepatic
malignancies. Radioembolization with yttrium-90 (90Y) microspheres is safe and effica￾cious for treatment of hepatic malignancies. The tumoricidal effect of radioembolization
is predominantly due to radioactivity and not ischemia. This article will present a compre￾hensive review of the side effects that have been associated with radioembolization using
90Y microspheres. Some of the described side effects are associated with all transarter￾ial procedures. Side effects specific to radioembolization will also be discussed in detail.
Methods to decrease the incidence of these potential side effects will also be discussed.

INTRODUCTION
PRIMARY HEPATIC MALIGNANCIES
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intra-hepatic cholangio￾carcinoma (ICC) are primary liver malignancies. HCC is much
more common than ICC (1, 2). Surgical resection is reserved for a
select group of patients with resectable disease (3). Orthotopic liver
transplantation may be performed in patients with HCC who are
within the Milan criteria (4). Chemoembolization and radiofre￾quency ablation are considered standard locoregional therapies
for patients with unresectable HCC (5, 6). Radioembolization is
an alternative locoregional therapy, which has established its role
in the management of primary liver tumors.
SECONDARY HEPATIC MALIGNANCIES
Malignancies commonly metastasize to the liver (7). Hepatic
metastases are generally managed by surgical resection or systemic
medical treatments. Radioembolization for hepatic metastases is
safe and effective in secondary hepatic malignancies (8–10).
RADIOEMBOLIC AGENTS
90Y microspheres are used in treatment of hepatic malignan￾cies. The details of 90Y are beyond the scope of this manuscript.
Table 1 presents the relevant differences in the two available 90Y
microsphere devices.
SIR-Spheres® are FDA-PMA (Food and Drug Administration￾Premarket Approval) approved for metastatic colorectal cancer
to the liver (11). TheraSpheres® are FDA approved under HDE
(humanitarian device exemption) for radiation treatment or as
neo-adjuvant to surgery or transplantation in patients with HCC
who can have appropriately placed hepatic arterial catheters (12).
This device is indicated for HCC patients with partial or branch
portal vein thrombosis/occlusion when clinical evaluation war￾rants the treatment. Other investigational uses of these devices are
being employed.
Multiple other radioactive devices are being investigated for
transarterial therapy. These include iodine-131 labeled iodized
oil, rhenium-188 HDD labeled iodized oil, phosphorus-32 glass
microspheres, and Milican/holmium-166 microspheres.
PRE-TREATMENT ASSESSMENT
Pre-treatment evaluation of radioembolization includes:
• Pre-treatment clinical evaluation
• Pre-treatment laboratory evaluation
• Pre-treatment radiological evaluation
• Pre-treatment angiography
Pre-treatment clinical evaluation
A multidisciplinary team consisting of hepatologists, med￾ical/surgical/radiation oncologists, transplant surgeons, and inter￾ventional radiologists should select patients for radioemboliza￾tion. A clinic visit is necessary. A history, which includes patient’s
prior surgical and medical therapies, is necessary. A recent article
suggested safety of radioembolization in patients who have had
prior partial hepatectomies (13). The patient’s performance sta￾tus per Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) should be
assessed.
Pre-treatment laboratory evaluation
Appropriate laboratory tests including but not limited to liver
function tests and corresponding tumor markers should be per￾formed to ascertain baseline values. For patients with cirrhosis,
it is essential to classify patients. The Child-Pugh classification
is commonly employed by multiple disciplines and includes the
following variables:
a) Serum bilirubin
b) Serum albumin
c) PT/INR
d) Encephalopathy
e) Ascites

FIGURE 1 | Schematic representation of celiac arterial anatomy.
Pre-treatment cross-sectional imaging evaluation
A triphasic liver CT or MRI is usually performed to evaluate the
following:
a) Extent of disease
b) Location of disease
c) Relative tumor hypervascularity
d) Variant vascular anatomy
Pre-treatment angiography
Angiography prior to radioembolization is essential. This provides
the interventional radiologist with knowledge of the hepatic arte￾rial anatomy and aberrant vasculature (14). Figure 1 is a diagram
representing conventional celiac arterial anatomy.
An aortogram assesses aortic atherosclerosis and tortuosity. A
superior mesenteric angiogram is essential to determine variant
vessels to the liver. Delayed images can assess the patency of the
portal vein. A celiac angiogram determines hepatic vasculature and
variants. Segment 1 tumors require special attention given various
potential contributing feeders (15). More selective angiography
with microcatheters/microwires is recommended to determine a
safe and efficacious point of radioembolization to the tumor.
Coil embolization
Coil embolization of communicating vessels that may lead to aber￾rant microsphere deposition can be performed if necessary. The
aberrant deposition of microspheres in the gastrointestinal tract
(GIT) or pancreas can have grave consequences (16–18). Some
vessels that may need to be coil embolized prior to treatment are:
gastroduodenal artery (GDA), right gastric artery (RGA), acces￾sory left gastric artery, falciform artery, phrenic arteries, inferior
esophageal artery,supraduodenal artery, and retroduodenal artery.
Pre-treatment prophylactic coil embolization is dependent on
the following variables (19, 20):
• Experience of the treating physician
• Planned location of radio-microsphere delivery
• Size of vessel
Collateral hepaticoenteric flow can develop following coil
embolization. This may increase aberrant microsphere deposi￾tion on following repeat treatments. Theoretically, if the interval
between coil embolization and radioembolization is long, this
phenomenon can also occur during the initial treatment. Further
research on this issue is needed.
POTENTIAL METHODS TO ENHANCE/CONFIRM TUMOR DELIVERY OF
RADIOMICROSPHERES
C-arm CT
Appropriate tumor targeting is now routinely confirmed by
using C-arm CT. This method aids in accurately recognizing
non-tumor/non-hepatic contrast delivery.
Consolidation of hepatic arterial flow
Variant hepatic artery and parasitized hepatic artery can be coil
embolized prior to radioembolization. This leads to intra-hepatic
collateralization in preparation for radioembolization.
Angiotensin II
A systematic review concluded that Angiotensin II could increase
tumor to non-tumor blood flow by approximately up to threefold
(21). However, further studies are needed to determine systemic
safety profile as Angiotensin II could increase systemic blood
pressure.
Degradable starch microspheres
A five patient analysis on the use of degradable starch microspheres
as an embolizate to normal hepatic parenchyma during radioem￾bolization was performed. Post-radioembolization SPECT/CT
demonstrated sparing of normal parenchyma (22). This is an
interesting concept, which needs validation.
TECHNETIUM-99M MACROAGGREGATED ALBUMIN (99MTC-MAA) SCAN
A
99mTc-MAA scan is performed to assess the lung shunt fraction
(LSF) and splanchnic shunting. Figure 2 shows a hypervascular
HCC. Figure 3 shows planar scintigraphic imaging from a nuclear
medicine scan demonstrating significant LSF. SPECT can enhance
detection of splanchnic flow. However, conventional angiogra￾phy is considered standard for identifying GI uptake by most
interventional radiologists (23).
In 2011, Sabet et al. published an article demonstrating that oral
administration of sodium perchlorate before the test angiogram
with 99mTc-MAA resulted in effective avoidance of free 99mTc￾pertechnetate concentration and decreased incidence of equivocal
findings in the gastroduodenal region (24).

DOSE CALCULATIONS
A brief overview of dose calculations is important to understand
potential complications. Recent data suggest that 99mTc-MAA
(simulates 90Y) and 99mTc-sulfur colloid (SC) (accumulates in
reticuloendothelial tissue), dual tracer SPECT/CT may provide
more accurate dose calculations as this method provides a more
accurate dose to functional liver (DFL) (25). Research is being
done on the utilization of PET/CT for dosimetry (26).
Dose calculation for TheraSphere®
Dose is calculated for TheraSphere® using the following formula:
Dose 
Gy
=
50 
Injected activity 
GBq[1 − LSF]
Liver Mass 
kg
Per the TheraSphere® package insert, the upper limit of injected
activity to the lungs is 0.61 GBq (12).
Dose calculation for SIR-Sphere®
The two acceptable methods for individual patient dose calcula￾tion for SIR-Sphere® include the partition model and empirical
model (11). The empirical model is based on dose known from
previously published clinical data and chooses the safest and most
effective dose from it. The recommended patient dose is based on
percent involvement by the tumor in the liver. A 3 GBq vial is used
for greater than 50% hepatic tumor involvement; a 2.5 GBq vial
is used for 25 to 50% hepatic tumor involvement; a 2 GBq vial is
used for less than 25% hepatic tumor involvement. The package
insert for SIR-sphere® acknowledges that individual patient dose
calculation is complex.
Additionally, LSF affects dose reduction. If there is less 10%
LSF, there is no reduction in dose. If there is 10–15% LSF, the
dose is reduced by a factor of 20%. If there is 15–20% LSF, the
dose is reduced by a factor of 40%. If the LSF is greater than 20%,
treatment is not recommended.
SINGLE-SESSION RADIOEMBOLIZATION
A recently published method of single-session radioembolization
(pre-treatment angiography/Tc-99m MAA scan/radioembolization
on same day) employed by the group showed no reportable events.
In this analysis, planar scintigraphy was performed in 2 h following
administration of Tc-99m MAA and LSF was determined. Final
dosimetry calculations were performed while the patient was being
transferred back from nuclear medicine to interventional radiol￾ogy. This method decreased the costs and time between initial
clinical assessment and radioembolization (27). It should be noted
that this method requires high level of expertise and efficient com￾munication between the nuclear medicine department, physicist,
and interventional radiologist.
POST-TREATMENT ASSESSMENT
Post-treatment imaging
At our institution, cross-sectional contrast enhanced imaging
(triphasic CT or MRI) is obtained at 1 month following treat￾ment and at 3 month intervals following the first post-treatment
imaging. This protocol evaluates response, or lack thereof, to
treatment.
Bremsstrahlung SPECT/CT and PET/CT are being investigated
for evaluating post-treatment technical success and predicting
treatment efficacy (26). Time of flight PET/CT has improved
spatial resolution when compared to Bremsstrahlung SPECT/CT.
Aberrant microsphere deposition may also be identified using
SPECT/CT and/or PET/CT. Gupta et al. have published a case
report of aberrant delivery of 90Y to the duodenum identi￾fied on PET/CT performed after radioembolization (28). Early
www.frontiersin.org July 2014 | Volume 4 | Article 198 | 3

Riaz et al. Side effects of yttrium-90 radioembolization
knowledge of aberrant microsphere deposition may lead to early
interventions.
Post-treatment laboratory evaluation
Post-treatment LFTs and complete blood count are usually per￾formed 1 month following treatment. Tumor markers (such as
alpha-fetoprotein for HCC) may aid in assessing response to
therapy.
COMPLICATIONS OF RADIOEMBOLIZATION
The complications occurring after radioembolization (29) are dis￾cussed in detail below. Table 2 summarizes available data on
post-radioembolization complications.
Please note that it is important to standardize recording and
reporting toxicities. Clinical and laboratory toxicities may be clas￾sified according to the standard criteria such as the Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0,
whenever possible (43). Tables 3 and 4 give some of the relevant
clinical and laboratory (investigational) toxicities according to
CTCAE v4.0.
POST-RADIOEMBOLIZATION SYNDROME
A post-radioembolization syndrome (PRS) includes fatigue, nau￾sea/vomiting, abdominal pain/discomfort, and/or cachexia. PRS
is less severe than that observed after embolic therapies. Hospital￾ization is rarely required (44–47). Incidence of PRS ranges from
20 to 70% (17, 44–46). In a two-institution, 112-patient analy￾sis, the incidence of PRS was 70% (48). Patients should be made
aware of these potential side effects before therapy. A 2-week post￾radioembolization telephone call is recommended to inquire for
symptoms of PRS. A clinic visit 1 month following treatment is
recommended to clinically assess the patient.
NAUSEA/VOMITING
Nausea and vomiting may occur following radioembolization.
Based on this experience, antinauseants/antiemetics such as

COMPLICATIONS DUE TO ABERRANT MICROSPHERE
DEPOSITION OR RADIOACTIVITY TO SURROUNDING
STRUCTURES
HEPATIC DYSFUNCTION
Pre-existing liver dysfunction is a significant confounding vari￾able when assessing post-radioembolization liver toxicities in HCC
patients (30). It is important to classify these cirrhotic patients
according to their liver function prior to treatment as previously
discussed. A Child-Pugh class C (score of greater or equal to
10) is usually considered a contraindication to locoregional ther￾apies. Patients with elevated baseline bilirubin (>2 mg/dL) are
generally not considered ideal candidates. As the background liver
parenchyma is usually normal in patients with hepatic metastases,
liver function tests are usually within normal limits. This may not
be the case where a majority of the liver is replaced by tumor.
Radiation-induced liver disease (RILD) is a potentially seri￾ous post-radioembolization complication (31). Given complexity
of radioembolization dosimetry, using the empirical method for
dose calculation is not recommended when using SIR-Spheres®.
The incidence of RILD after 90Y radioembolization ranges from 0
to 4% (30–32). RILD occurs due to the exposure of normal hepatic
parenchyma to radiation. The embolic (ischemic) effect of these
microscopic particles is minimal and is not thought to contribute
to the hepatotoxicity from radioembolization.
Available data
A recent article demonstrated repeated radioembolization to be
a significant risk factor in development of radioembolization
induced liver disease (49). Two of the patients in their eight-patient
analysis who had received multiple radioembolization treatments
died with clinical features of RILD.
Prior exposure of the liver to external beam radiation therapy
(EBRT) may lead to increased liver toxicity after radioemboliza￾tion. This depends on fractional liver exposure and dose level. The
authors concluded that radioembolization appears to be safe for
the treatment of hepatic malignancies only in patients who have
had limited hepatic exposure to prior EBRT (50).
As biochemical aberrations may occur without clinical manifes￾tations, follow-up liver function tests are routinely recommended
1 month after treatment. In rare cases of clinically manifest RILD,
a biopsy of the normal parenchyma may help confirm the diag￾nosis. A case of post-radioembolization fulminant hepatic failure
has been reported (51).
In a single center article analyzing hepatic dysfunction follow￾ing radioembolization with SIR-Spheres®, liver function toxicity
(grades 1 through 4) was seen in 58% of infusions. The median
duration of LFT toxicities was 20–29 days. Grade 3 or greater toxi￾cities occurred after 9% of infusions in their analysis. One patient
died in 32 days of treatment with signs and symptoms compatible
with radiation-induced liver disease (52).
Dose to functional liver
99mTc-SC SPECT has been used to calculate DFL. 99mTc-SC
accumulates in normal liver parenchyma due to presence of
reticuloendothelial tissue. Increased post-radioembolization liver
enzyme elevation was seen with increased DFL (25).
Hepatic fibrosis/portal hypertension
Pre-existing findings consistent with portal hypertension are not
a contraindication to radioembolization. Post-radioembolizaiton
hepatic fibrosis and/or portal hypertension are potential post￾treatment complications (53). In an analysis by Jakobs et al. (54),
32 patients with secondary hepatic malignancies were selected to
exclude the confounding variable of cirrhosis. Mean decrease in
hepatic volume was 11.8% and mean increase in splenic volume
was 27.9% in patients who had undergone bilobar radioemboliza￾tion. The authors concluded that radioembolization may cause
portal hypertension by imaging criteria. However, no patients
exhibited any clinical sequelae of portal hypertension. Clini￾cally significant manifestations such as reduced platelet counts
(<100,000/dL) or variceal bleeding are rarely seen following
radioembolization.
Radioembolization in patients with transjugular intra-hepatic
portosystemic shunts
Radioembolization can be performed in patients with transjugular
intra-hepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS). An analysis by Memon
et al. (55) in patients with TIPS who underwent radioemboliza￾tion demonstrated new grade 3/4 bilirubin toxicity in 25% of their
patients.
BILIARY SEQUELAE
Post-radioembolization biliary complications are potential side
effects of radioembolization. The incidence of these complica￾tions is less than 10% (33). These may be due to the microembolic
effect or radiation-induced injury to the biliary system.
Post-radioembolization biliary complication rates are signifi￾cantly higher in patients with surgeries/procedures violating the
integrity of the ampulla of Vater. 90Y radioembolization in the
setting of tumor-related biliary obstruction has an acceptable
safety profile (36). Biliary complication incidence is also higher
in patients who have had polychyemotherapy. Cirrhosis is found
to be protective against biliary complications (35).
These patients usually present with pain and can be evaluated
with conventional anatomic imaging techniques (33). Incidentally
found biliary sequelae on imaging may be seen. Hence, clinical cor￾relation with the imaging findings is necessary (56, 57). Biopsy
may be needed in rare cases (34). Following are some biliary
complications that have been observed after radioembolization:
Radiation cholecystitis
Radiation cholecystitis may be prevented by identifying the cystic
artery. Microsphere injection distal to its origin and coiling can
decrease its incidence. (58). This is schematically seen in Figure 4.
Cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice.
Radiation-induced cholangitis
Fever, jaundice, and right upper quadrant pain may repre￾sent radiation-induced cholangitis following radioembolization.
Antibiotics may be required.

FIGURE 4 | Schematic representation of aberrant microsphere

Abscess/bilomas
Abscesses and bilomas are intra-hepatic fluid collections that
may form following radioembolization. Bilomas are usually clini￾cally occult and require conservative management. Abscesses may
require percutaneous drainage.
Other
a) Obstructive jaundice due to biliary strictures
b) Biliary necrosis
RADIATION PNEUMONITIS
Radiation pneumonitis is very rare (less than 1% if standard
dosimetry models are used) (35, 36). This is schematically rep￾resented in Figure 5. Please note that if LSF is high, the chance of
delivering a high pulmonary dose increases.
Delivery to the lungs of greater than 30 Gray (Gy) in one
treatment or a cumulative dose of greater than 50 Gy in mul￾tiple treatments is considered a relative contraindication. Pla￾nar scintigraphy is usually employed to calculate LSF. Yu et al.
described a new method of calculating the mean lung dose for
TheraSphere® and SIR-Sphere® radioembolization of liver can￾cer based on 99mTc-MAA SPECT/CT. According to Yu et al., this
method provides a more accurate estimate of radiation risk to the
lungs (59). However, this is not routinely performed currently.
A restrictive ventilatory dysfunction following radioemboliza￾tion has been reported (60). Radiation pneumonitis can be seen
as a typical bat-wing appearance on chest CT (35). Data pre￾sented by Salem et al. demonstrated a very low incidence of
post-radioembolization pulmonary complication (36).
Steroids may play a role in management. Other thoracic
complications include atelectasis and/or pleural effusion.
GASTROINTESTINAL (GI) COMPLICATIONS
Diarrhea
Diarrhea has been described following radioembolization. This is
rarely significant enough to require hospitalization.
FIGURE 5 | Schematic representation of aberrant microsphere
deposition in the lungs.
Gastroenteritis/gastrointestinal ulcera
Post-radioembolization GI complications occur secondary to
hepaticoenteric arterial communications resulting in aberrant
microsphere deposition (37). Recognition of these hepaticoenteric
arterial communications is essential (38). This is schematically
represented in Figure 6. Incidence of GI complications is less than
5% (37–40).
Prophylactic coil embolization of the gastroduodenal and
RGA may be considered. The left hepatic angiogram is per￾formed to identify left gastric and inferior esophageal arteries.
Delayed angiography of the left hepatic artery with opacifica￾tion of the coronary vein confirms hepaticoenteric flow. The right
hepatic angiogram is required to identify the supraduodenal and
retroportal arteries (23).
Prophylactic use of gastric acid suppressive agents (such as pro￾ton pump inhibitors) is recommended. If GI ulceration is clinically
suspected, endoscopy is recommended to confirm the diagnosis
(39, 61).
A recent root cause analysis showed stasis during injection to
be the strongest independent risk factor for development of gas￾troduodenal complications (42). Distal origin of the GDA, young
age (p = 0.04), and proximal injection of the microspheres were
also significant risk factors.
A potential complication of coil embolization of vessels, such
as the GDA and RGA, is formation of collateral hepaticoenteric
flow. This can result in increased enteric complications on repeat
treatments.
ACUTE PANCREATITIS
Acute pancreatitis is a potential but very rare complication of
radioembolization (62). Patients present with severe epigastric or

periumbilical pain. Serum lipase and amylase levels are usually
elevated. Imaging may be helpful to determine other causes of
acute pancreatitis. SPECT/CT to detect 90Y Bremsstrahlung in the
pancreas may be performed. Treatment is conservative.
RADIATION DERMATITIS
Periumbilical pain may occur due to aberrant microsphere depo￾sition in the anterior abdominal wall via the falciform artery (16,
19, 20). Radiation dermatitis is rare.
Recognition of the falciform artery is essential. Prophylactic
embolization of this vessel can be performed if needed to decrease
the incidence of radiation dermatitis. Prophylactic topically
applied ice prevents complications as it causes vasoconstriction
which decreases cutaneous flow (63).
LYMPHOPENIA
Lymphopenia may be seen after glass microsphere radioem￾bolization. Greater than 25% decrease in lymphocyte count after
treatment is seen in the majority of patients (45, 64). How￾ever, no opportunistic infections due to the lymphopenia after
radioembolization have been reported (45, 64).
OTHER COMPLICATIONS
THROMBOCYTOPENIA
A retrospective analysis demonstrated thrombocytopenia as a
complication following radioembolization. Splenomegaly can be
seen following radioembolization which was shown to be an
independent risk factor for development of a low platelet count
(65). No significant bleeding diathesis has been reported due to
thrombocytopenia following radioembolization.
VASCULAR INJURY
The incidence of vascular injury may be prevented by the
following:
a) Knowledge of prior anti-cancer therapy
b) Stopping and resuming “blood thinners” appropriately
c) Reviewing cross-sectional anatomy to determine vascular
anatomy such as the furcation of the common femoral artery.
Dissection
Newer anti-cancer drugs such as bevacizumab (Avastin) have been
shown to make vasculature more friable and prone to injury,
increasing the chances of dissection and vascular rupture. Abnor￾malities in vasculature and hepatic arterial flow in 12/16 (75%)
patients who were on anti-cancer therapy has been reported.
During angiography, a search for stenoses and abnormal flow
should be undertaken (66). Murthy et al. (67) demonstrated a
reasonable safety profile of radioembolization with resin micros￾pheres in 10 patients who had been on cetuximab or bevacizumab.
Usage of microcatheters and careful wire/catheter manipulation is
recommended in patients on or previously exposed to systemic
anti-cancer therapy.
Dissection at the site of arteriotomy is rare but possible. A
pre-closure common femoral angiogram assists in its diagnosis.
However, this may not be routinely performed. The patient may
present with a “cold” extremity and stenting/anti-platelet therapy
may be required.
Bleeding
Hematoma formation at the arteriotomy may be seen in radioem￾bolization (68). Standard protocols mitigating bleeding such as
stopping “blood thinners” and making sure the patient’s coag￾ulation profile is within normal limits should be meticulously
employed (69). Manual compression may be necessary. Surgical
intervention is very rarely required.
If there is suspicion of pseudoaneurysm formation, ultrasound
with Doppler may be needed. This is usually treated with ultra￾sound guided manual compression. Thrombin injection may be
performed if necessary. Surgery is rarely necessary.
CONTRAST INDUCED NEPHROTOXICITY
It is important to know the patient’s baseline renal function
prior to performing transarterial therapies such as radioem￾bolization. Adequate hydration pre- and post-radioembolization
and stringent use of iodinated contrast limit contrast induced
nephrotoxicity.
ALLERGIC REACTION TO IODINATED CONTRAST MEDIA
Anticipation of possible allergic reactions is essential. Most
patients being considered for radioembolization have received
prior iodinated contrast media for CT scans. An allergic reac￾tion can range from a minor reaction such as a pruritic rash to an
anaphylactoid reaction. If there is a history of prior minor allergic
reactions (such as hives) to iodinated contrast, the patient may still
received iodinated contrast after receiving an allergy preparation
prior to planned transarterial procedure (usually a combination
of steroids and anti-histamines).

ACUTE CHILLS
Acute chills may occur during treatment, which usually respond
to anti-histamines (70).
CONCLUSION
Radioembolization is being employed for treatment of various
hepatic malignancies. As with any other common therapy, knowl￾edge of potential complications of this therapy is essential. Select￾ing appropriate patients using a multidisciplinary approach can
improve outcomes and decrease complications. Meticulous pre￾treatment planning (angiography and 99mTc-MAA scintigraphic
imaging) is necessary to minimize side effects of radioemboliza￾tion. The incidence of complications that may require intervention
is low. Grade 3 or higher complications following radioemboliza￾tion occur in less than 9% of patients. Aberrant microsphere
deposition may lead to various complications such as radiation
cholecystitis. Surgical therapy may be required in severe cases. As
radioembolization is a transarterial procedure, knowledge of gen￾eral complications associated with transarterial therapies is also
important.
