Predicting relapse in patients with
inflammatory bowel disease: what is
the role of biomarkers?
D S Pardi, W J Sandborn
...................................................................................
Faecal calprotectin seems to be a relatively sensitive and specific
marker of the risk of relapse in ulcerative colitis, but not in Crohn’s
disease
Various laboratory biomarkers have
been studied in inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD) as diagnostic
aids, indicators of disease activity or
severity, and to predict the risk of
relapse in those patients in remission.
These biomarkers have enormous
potential implications for patient
management. For example, therapeutic
decisions could be directed more
appropriately if a marker could reliably
distinguish active IBD from other
inflammatory or non-inflammatory
causes of symptoms, or if one could
distinguish Crohn’s disease from ulcera￾tive colitis. In addition, a simple, inex￾pensive, sensitive, specific marker could
help monitor response in the clinic and
in clinical trials. Finally, the ability to
reliably predict the risk of recurrence
would help direct appropriate therapy to
those who would most likely benefit
from it and avoid the expense and
potential toxicity of chronic mainte￾nance therapy in those who have a low
risk of recurrence. In the current issue of
Gut, Costa and colleagues1 addressed the
latter issue by studying the role of faecal
calprotectin as a marker of risk of
relapse in ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s
disease (see page 364). Calprotectin
represents 50–60% of neutrophilic cyto￾solic protein, is stable in faeces for
several days after excretion, and has a
relatively easy to perform assay which is
available commercially and correlates
well with the more difficult and more
expensive indium 111-labelled leucocyte
excretion2
Costa and colleagues1 studied 38
patients with Crohn’s disease and 41
with ulcerative colitis in remission for a
mean of five months. A baseline faecal
calprotectin level greater than 150 mg/g
had a sensitivity for predicting relapse
within the next year of 89% in ulcerative
colitis and 87% in Crohn’s disease. The
specificity in ulcerative colitis was 82%
but only 43% in Crohn’s disease. After
multivariate analysis, patients with
Crohn’s disease with a baseline faecal
calprotectin greater than 150 mg/g had a
non-significant twofold increased like￾lihood of relapse whereas those with
ulcerative colitis and an elevated faecal
calprotectin had a significant 14-fold
increase risk. C reactive protein (CRP)
and erythrocyte sedimentation rate
(ESR), either as single tests or combined
with calprotectin, were not useful for
predicting relapse.
The results of this study add to the
growing body of literature on biomar￾kers in IBD in general and faecal
calprotectin in particular. In previous
studies, faecal calprotectin has been
shown to be a sensitive marker of
activity in Crohn’s disease and to
correlate well with endoscopic and
histological disease activity in ulcerative
colitis.3 4 Faecal calprotectin also nor￾malises along with endoscopic healing
in Crohn’s disease5 and is a very
sensitive and specific marker for distin￾guishing IBD from irritable bowel syn￾drome (IBS).3 The Costa study suggests
that calprotectin is a good marker of
relapse risk in ulcerative colitis, but not
in Crohn’s disease, related primarily to
poor specificity, and therefore poor
positive predictive value. However, a
previous study of faecal calprotectin as
a marker of relapse risk in IBD found a
faecal calprotectin level of 50 mg/g to be
a sensitive and specific marker of
recurrence risk in both ulcerative colitis
and Crohn’s disease.6 In this study,
patients with a faecal calprotectin level
greater than 50 mg/g had a 13-fold
increased risk of relapse, and the speci￾ficity for predicting relapse in Crohn’s
disease was 83%, compared with 43% in
the Costa study.6
The reason(s) for the poorer specifi￾city of calprotectin in the current study
are not clear. A different cut off value
was used, but the higher cut off in the
Costa study would be expected to
increase specificity rather than decrease
it. The definition of remission and
relapse were similar in the two studies,
and both used an ELISA assay
(although the assays were probably at
least slightly different). In the previous
study, patients were in remission for 1–
4 months while in the Costa study they
were in remission for 1–12 months.
Perhaps the value of calprotectin for
predicting relapse in Crohn’s disease
decreases the longer a patient is in
remission.
Several other clinical indices and
biological markers have been studied
in IBD. These can be divided into clinical
disease activity indices, endoscopic
indices, serum markers, faecal markers,
and miscellaneous tests. Clinical indices,
including the Crohn’s disease activity
index (CDAI) and other disease activity
indices for Crohn’s disease and ulcera￾tive colitis, are largely subjective and
typically cumbersome and have signifi￾cant interobserver variability. Further￾more, they are not valid in patients with
fistulas, stomas, and non-inflammatory
causes of symptoms (for example, ste￾nosis, post surgical anatomy). There are
also several endoscopic indices of sever￾ity. The Crohn’s disease endoscopic
index of severity7 has a poor correlation
with clinical activity and treatment
induced remission, although complete
mucosal healing may predict a favour￾able course. However, this index is
complex and not suitable for routine
clinical practice.8 The most well known
endoscopic index of severity is the
Rutgeerts score which is simple and
accurately predicts the risk of recurrence
after surgical resection.9
A multitude of serum markers have
been studied in IBD. Many of these are
acute phase reactants (acid a1 glycopro￾tein (orosomucoid)), CRP, fibrinogen,
lactoferrin, serum amyloid A, and a1
antitrypsin.10 In an early study, Brignola
and colleagues found that combining
acid a1 glycoprotein, a2 globulin, and
ESR into an index resulted in 88%
accuracy in predicting relapse over
18 months in patients with Crohn’s
disease in remission.11 They found no
value in baseline levels of haemoglobin,
white blood cell count, albumin, iron, or
CRP. Other studies have also found
limited value for CRP in predicting
relapse.1 6 12 Data on other markers such
as serum and urinary neopterin levels,
serum tumour necrosis factor (TNF) a
levels, TNF-a receptor levels, and var￾ious interleukins (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8),
interleukin receptors (IL-2R, IL-6R),
or interleukin receptor antagonists
(IL-1ra) are limited or contradictory.9 13
As serum markers of inflammation
can be elevated in a variety of condi￾tions, it seems likely that faecal markers

of inflammation, in the absence of
enteric infection, would be more specific
for IBD. Faecal markers can be divided
into faecal excretion of leucocytes,
serum proteins, or leucocyte products.
Faecal excretion of indium 111-labelled
white blood cells has a good correlation
with colitis but not ileitis and has
no correlation with CDAI.14 These
issues, together with the cost, radiation
exposure, and limited availability of
this technology makes measurement
of faecal excretion of indium-labelled
white blood cells of limited value
clinically.
Faecal excretion of various serum
proteins has also been studied in IBD.
Perhaps the best studied is faecal a1
antitrypsin excretion. However, the data
on this protein and its correlation with
disease activity and response to therapy
are mixed.14 More promising is faecal
excretion of various leucocyte products.
Faecal lysozyme excretion correlates
with disease activity and indium 111
white blood cell excretion in colitis but
not in ileitis, and it is also elevated in
other gastrointestinal inflammatory dis￾orders, limiting its specificity for IBD.14
Faecal lactoferrin concentration is
increased in active IBD compared with
inactive IBD, IBS, and healthy con￾trols.14 15 In addition, in patients taper￾ing off steroids, persistent elevations in
faecal lactoferrin may predict an
increased risk of early relapse and
therefore may help guide the rapidity
of the steroid taper.15 Finally, faecal
lactoferrin levels may rise significantly
prior to a clinically evident relapse and
thus may be a good marker to predict
subsequent IBD flares.15 Other faecal
markers, such as elastase, myeloperox￾idase, leucocyte esterase, and TNF-a,
have less promising data.14
Several miscellaneous tests have also
been studied in IBD. Indium 111 white
blood cell scanning can identify and
localise active disease and distinguish
IBD from IBS and fibrotic from inflam￾matory strictures. However, labelled
leucocyte scans cannot distinguish IBD
from other causes of intestinal inflam￾mation and are expensive and involve
radiation exposure.16
Intestinal permeability can be mea￾sured by a variety of methods. Measures
of intestinal permeability have 95%
sensitivity for identifying active
Crohn’s enteritis but only 50% for
colitis.17 Intestinal permeability is
thought to be a potentially useful
measure of response to therapy in
Crohn’s disease, particularly in the small
bowel.16 In Crohn’s disease, tests of
intestinal permeability have a sensitivity
of 84–89% and a specificity of 61–76%
for predicting relapse within one year
but only 53% and 85%, respectively, at
four months.8 Furthermore, these tests
are somewhat time consuming and
difficult, with limited availability and
therefore are of questionable clinical
value.
Other tests that have been used to
measure disease activity or to predict
relapse include assaying whole gut
lavage fluid for immunoglobulin G,
IL-1B, and IL-8.13 However, data on
these markers are limited and patient
acceptability would likely be low for
repeated testing. Others have measured
various inflammatory markers, includ￾ing TNF-a and IL-1B production from
stimulated cultured lamina propria
mononuclear cells and showed that the
degree of production is predictive of
relapse over one year.18 However,
this technology requires mucosal bio￾psies and therefore application to
small bowel disease would be limited.
Furthermore, this technique is relatively
difficult requiring cell culture and
stimulation.
In summary, the current clinical
indices or biological markers of disease
activity are for the most part too
invasive, too difficult, too expensive, or
require radiation exposure. Two possible
exceptions are faecal calprotectin and
faecal lactoferrin excretion, which are
relatively simple and inexpensive. Based
on two studies to date1 6 faecal calpro￾tectin seems to be a relatively sensitive
and specific marker of the risk of relapse
in ulcerative colitis. It also appears to be
a sensitive marker of relapse risk in
Crohn’s disease but the data on specifi￾city are conflicting at this point.
However, these data need to be inter￾preted cautiously. The number of
studies is small, and in both studies
using calprotectin to predict relapse
risk, most patients were on medical
therapy. Calprotectin may behave
differently in patients who are on no
therapy. Therefore, before faecal calpro￾tectin or any other biological marker
of activity can be incorporated into
routine clinical practice, other studies
in larger and diverse groups of patients
will be necessary to clarify its role
further.

Wireless capsule endoscopy and
Crohn’s disease
P Swain
...................................................................................
Wireless capsule endoscopy appears to be superior to all current
forms of radiological investigation of the small intestine in
detecting the mucosal abnormalities of Crohn’s disease
When the wireless capsule endo￾scope (WCE) was introduced,1
fears that the capsule might
become impacted caused early clinical
protocols to exclude any patients with a
hint of previous subacute obstruction or
symptoms suggestive of Crohn’s dis￾ease.2–6 In fact a few patients with
Crohn’s disease were inadvertently
included in these early studies3–6 as the
symptoms of this disease are often
subtle and other investigations are
sometimes inconclusive. WCE in a short
time has acquired a well established role
in the investigation of patients with
recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding of
obscure origin when gastroscopy and
colonoscopy fail to reveal the source.2–6
Occult Crohn’s disease was found to be
a cause of bleeding or anaemia in
several of these series. Capsule endo￾scopy has been used in more than
100 000 patients worldwide.
Several comparative studies have
shown that WCE could outperform push
enteroscopy in finding clinical causes of
bleeding. Although the image quality of
push enteroscopy is superior in the area
it reached, WCE did not miss much that
push enteroscopy saw and provided
images from the large percentage of
the small intestine that could not be
reached by push enteroscopy. In five
comparisons the capsule found more
small intestinal pathology than push
enteroscopy (66%, 68%, 69%, 55%, 66% v
19%, 32%, 36%, 38%, 28%)3–5 7 8 and four
of these studies showed statistically
significant differences in favour of
capsule endoscopy.4578
WCE has also performed well in com￾parisons with small bowel radiology.
Just as the numbers of barium meal and
barium enemas have atrophied with the
widespread availability of gastroscopy
and colonoscopy, radiological investiga￾tions of small intestinal disease may
also wither with the advent of painless
less invasive enteroscopy offered by the
wireless capsule endoscope.
The first published study on this topic
by Costamagna et al in Gastroenterology9
comparing capsule endoscopy with radi￾ology in the form of a small bowel meal
caused controversy because some felt
that WCE was being compared with an
inferior radiological investigation. In
this study, barium follow through was
normal in 17 patients and showed ileal
nodularity in three patients. Capsule
endoscopy was normal in three patients
and showed positive findings in the
remaining 17 patients. The barium
study was considered diagnostic in four
(20%) patients. Capsule endoscopy was
considered diagnostic in nine (45%)
patients, suspicious in eight (40%)
patients, and failed in three (15%)
patients. For obscure gastrointestinal
bleeding, the diagnostic potential of
barium follow through was much worse
compared with capsule endoscopy (5% v
31%; p ,0.05). Capsule endoscopy was
well tolerated and better accepted by
patients compared with the most
recently performed endoscopic proce￾dure.
Subsequent studies have shown that
wireless capsule was also superior to
state of the art enteroclysis (small bowel
enema) and computed tomography (CT)
enteroclysis, which currently constitute
the best available radiological investiga￾tions for imaging the small bowel.
Liangpunsakul and colleagues10 com￾pared state of the art enteroclysis with
WCE for its capacity to demonstrate
ulcers in the small intestine. There were
40 patients during this study period
with negative upper and lower endos￾copies and small bowel series. Three
patients had multiple small bowel ulcers
detected by WCE. The radiologists were
told in advance of the WCE findings.
Despite this, the enteroclysis studies
were negative. All three patients
improved after therapy for Crohn’s
disease. In this study, WCE was more
sensitive for small bowel ulcers than the
best enteroclysis available.
Voderholzer and colleagues11 com￾pared the diagnostic yield of WCE with
CT enteroclysis. Twenty two patients
with suspected small bowel pathology
underwent both CT enteroclysis and
wireless capsule enteroscopy examina￾tions, conducted by two independent
blinded investigators. The results of the
two investigations (diagnoses and num￾ber, extent, and location of lesions
detected) were compared by a third
investigator. Patients included in the
study had obscure gastrointestinal
bleeding (n = 8), Crohn’s disease (n
= 8), unexplained diarrhoea (n = 5), or
suspected carcinoid tumour (n = 1).
Pathological lesions were detected using
capsule enteroscopy in 13 patients (59
%) and using CT enteroclysis in eight
(36%; p = 0.12). In seven patients (one
case each of colonic Crohn’s disease,
diverticulitis, Meckel’s diverticulum,
carcinoid tumour, mesothelioma, colon￾ic polyps, and irritable bowel syn￾drome), no pathological changes were
found in the small intestine using either
method. The diagnosis was established
by wireless capsule enteroscopy in four
patients with obscure bleeding whereas
CT enteroclysis was positive in only one
patient (p = 0.1). Crohn’s disease was
found in two patients with unexplained
diarrhoea. Small bowel lesions were
identified in six patients with known
Crohn’s disease using capsule entero￾scopy or CT enteroclysis. Wireless cap￾sule enteroscopy detected more small
bowel lesions than CT enteroclysis in
patients with obscure gastrointestinal
bleeding and Crohn’s disease.
Enteroclysis with or without CT or
magnetic resonance may produce super￾ior images compared with barium fol￾low through but is hated by many
patients who find the trans-nasal intu￾bation of the duodenum uncomfortable.
Technical improvements in MR have
allowed this technology to provide good
quality small bowel images using MR
enteroclysis, and contrast swallowed by
mouth may provide nearly as good
images as those acquired when contrast
is administered by nasoduodenal tube.12
The surprise to many endoscopists
using capsule endoscopy was how some
apparently very severe mucosal abnorm￾alities could be missed on good quality
radiological studies.
There are now several fully published
peer reviewed studies suggesting that
Crohn’s disease can be diagnosed with
capsule endoscopy in patients who have
had a negative colonoscopy, gastro￾scopy, and small bowel barium stud￾ies.13–17 It may be true that a higher rate
of ileoscopy might have increased the
rate of diagnosis of Crohn’s disease in
some of these series. Rates of ileoscopy
in large published series of colonoscopy
are surprisingly low (for example, 11%
in 9000 patients18) and it can be difficult
to get through the ileocaecal valve,
especially if Crohn’s disease has altered

the anatomy of the valve. WCE on the
other hand does not always reach the
ileocaecal valve because of delayed
transit.
It is clear from these and other studies
that patients with normal ileoscopy at
colonoscopy have been found to have
small bowel abnormalities which are
thought to be Crohn’s disease at capsule
endoscopy and appeared to respond to
treatment for this condition. Mow and
colleagues,16 Hume and colleagues,19 and
Lo20 suggested that capsule enteroscopy
may be especially helpful in distinguish￾ing Crohn’s disease from ulcerative
colitis in patients with indeterminate
colitis, perhaps especially in those in
whom ileal pouch formation is being
considered. WCE has also been used in
children with gastrointestinal blood
loss, anaemia, or abdominal pain, and
cases of Crohn’s disease are a moder￾ately common finding in this group.21 22
In India, WCE was able to provide
images of small intestinal tuberculosis
which can be difficult to distinguish
from Crohn’s disease.23
In Voderholzer’s paper published in
this issue of Gut,
24 the frequency of small
intestinal Crohn’s disease found by
WCE in a consecutive series of patients
with Crohn’s was double that detected
by CT enteroclysis (25 v 12/41; p,0.005)
and these findings led to alteration of
management in 10 patients with clinical
improvement in all (see page 369). They
suggest that the logic of designing slow
release treatments that are only effective
in the colon and terminal ileum for
Crohn’s disease may be flawed. Their
results also demonstrate that a normal
terminal ileoscopy at colonoscopy does
not exclude active small bowel Crohn’s
disease higher up and also that a normal
wireless capsule examination does not
rule out the diagnosis of Crohn’s disease
(lesions can be missed or not reached).
Because WCE appears superior to all
current forms of radiological investiga￾tion of the small intestine in detecting
the mucosal abnormalities of Crohn’s
disease, one might imagine that there
would be rapid adoption of this techni￾que which does not expose patients to
the hazards of repeated high dose x ray
examinations and that radiological
methods might be abandoned. There
will be some hesitancy to do this for
three reasons. There is anxiety that a
capsule might become stuck or impacted
against a stricture. The costs and man￾power implications of changing from
small bowel radiology to WCE will slow
the rate of uptake. WCE will probably be
less good than radiology at detecting
fistulae and this might be a reason for
occasionally choosing radiological inves￾tigations in preference to capsule exam￾inations.
Addressing the stricture issue, capsule
impaction does occur and the reported
incidence was 2% in one large pooled
series.25 Perhaps unexpectedly, most
capsule impactions are asymptomatic
and rarely produce obstructive symp￾toms of colicky abdominal pain, failure
to pass gas, or vomiting. If the capsule is
pointing forwards it may provide good
images of the stricture. It is usually
possible to tell if the capsule is pointing
forwards as it passes through the
pylorus and does not usually ‘‘tumble’’
once in the small intestine. For many
patients, capsule impaction can be a
good outcome as it can lead to surgery
which can cure symptoms and also
provide histological diagnoses, which
are sometimes unexpected. Most recom￾mend that if the capsule examination
does not show images of the colon, and
the patient does not notice the passage
of the capsule in the stool, a plain
abdominal x ray should be performed
approximately seven days after the
examination to check for capsule reten￾tion.
It would dampen enthusiasm for the
use of wireless capsule examination in
Crohn’s disease if a radiological study
such as a CT enteroclysis had to precede
every wireless capsule examination.
Alternative options might include the
use of a ‘‘patency capsule’’, careful
patient selection to avoid patients with
symptoms suggestive of subacute
obstruction, using capsules on a thread
so that the capsule could be retrieved if
it got stuck at a stricture, making a
smaller diameter capsule, which might
also be valuable in small children, and
developing better retrieval methods.
A ‘‘patency’’ capsule has been devel￾oped (M2A patency; Given, Yoqneam,
Israel) to detect possible strictures non￾invasively which might lead to capsule
retention. This device has identical
dimensions to the M2A wireless capsule
endoscope. It contains a small trans￾ponder in the form of a passive radio￾frequency identification tag (RFID) and
a dissolving body. Patency is verified if
the capsule is excreted intact from the
patient’s body. Excretion is tested before
disintegration with a patency scanner,
which emits a radiofrequency signal and
detects the presence of the RFID tag in
the patient’s body. If the capsule is
retained in the gastrointestinal tract, it
disintegrates into small, mostly soft,

fragments which can easily pass
through strictures
Clinical studies with the patency
capsule are available at present in
abstract form only. In one study, 61
patients ingested 63 patency capsules:
36 capsules were excreted intact (29/36
in less than 40 hours) and 27 disinte￾grated in the gastrointestinal tract. Of
54 patients who had radiographically
indicated strictures, 31/54 passed the
capsules intact. Fifteen patients who
tested positively for patency were given
the M2A video capsule, all of which
passed naturally.26 These results suggest
that this method might be used in
patients with suspected Crohn’s disease
strictures to allow safe use of the
wireless capsule endoscope without
prior radiological investigation, even in
patients with strictures.
The absence of a ‘‘definition’’ of
Crohn’s disease causes difficulties.
Voderholzer and colleagues24 has sug￾gested that the finding of more than 10
aphthous ulcers on a capsule examina￾tion is strongly suggestive of Crohn’s
disease. It seems likely that a few
patients with one or two aphthous
ulcers may be found to have Crohn’s
disease if they are followed up, but most
will not. It is also apparent that a
normal wireless capsule examination
does not exclude Crohn’s disease as
lesions are missed by this examination,
as with any other, and because macro￾scopic mucosal abnormalities can heal
completely and relapse later in the colon
and are likely to do the same in the
small intestine. The ultimate diagnosis
of patients with a few aphthous ulcers
in the small intestine on WCE, assum￾ing such patients are not taking non￾steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, will
require prospective studies.
Capsule endoscopy appears to be most
valuable in its ability to diagnose early
Crohn’s disease, and several studies
have demonstrated its value in patients
with suggestive symptoms but negative
colonoscopy and radiology. It also has
proved valuable in investigating chil￾dren with symptoms suggestive of
Crohn’s disease.20 21
It may be possible to categorise early
endoscopic appearances of small bowel
Crohn’s disease from wireless capsule
images as follows: notching of folds, a
few small aphthous ulcers, larger ulcers,
linear ulcers, circumferential involve￾ment, abnormal vascularity, vasculitis,
and even cobblestone appearances
before radiological involvement can be
demonstrated. The images in figs 1–4
were all taken from patients with
normal small bowel radiology who
improved clinically when treated for
Crohn’s disease. Location, length of
segment involvement, and small bowel
transit information can be derived from
the capsule images, localisation imager,
and timer, although the capsule often
does not move at a steady rate and
frequently moves in a retrograde fash￾ion.
WCE does not yet feature a biopsy
capacity. Such a function would be very
valuable for management and diagnosis
of small intestinal Crohn’s. The advent
in Japan of a practical but demanding
form of push enteroscopy with a double
balloon system has allowed for the first
time the possibility of taking directed
biopsies under endoscopic visual control
from the mid jejunum and upper ileum27
without surgery.
There is currently a problem with how
best to use capsule endoscopy in
patients with abdominal pain or irrita￾ble bowel-like syndrome symptoms.
Some of these patients may have
Crohn’s disease or perhaps coeliac dis￾ease but most will not have small
intestinal pathology. The finding of one
or two aphthous ulcers or erosions in
patients during capsule endoscopy is
common and it is likely that many of
these do not have Crohn’s disease. It
may be clinically expedient at present to
avoid using WCE in patients with
chronic abdominal pain unless they also
have abnormal blood tests or other
symptoms such as weight loss, as the
incidence of clinically relevant small
intestinal pathology is very low while
minor clinically irrelevant abnormalities
are common.28
It seems probable that the wireless
capsule will have an increasing role in
the investigation and management of
Crohn’s disease and will be used in
preference to radiological investigations
using x rays. It is likely to be of most
assistance in the early diagnosis, in
determining the extent and sites of
small intestinal involvement, and in
examining patients with indeterminate
colitis. It may also be valuable in
differentiating Crohn’s from other
causes of small intestinal disease, find
a role as a radiation free method of
follow up, and provide evidence about
the cause of specific symptoms which

Pancreaticobiliary biofilm: is
cholesterol the answer?
R A Kozarek
...................................................................................
Cholesterol stone formation may be a physiological response to
limit bacterial biofilm development in bile. Its incorporation into
plastic polymers may be a novel way to prevent biofilm
development and subsequent stent occlusion in patients with
biliary prostheses
B
acteria in the biliary tree have been
the bane of surgeons and gastro￾enterologists alike. On the one
hand, up to 50% of patients with chronic
cholecystitis have positive bile cultures,
as do 75% of patients with acute
cholecystitis, and virtually 100% of
individuals with cholangitis.1 2 On the
other hand, gut flora are thought to play
a key role in the formation of at least
black pigment and mixed gall stones, by
virtue of mucus production, and the
elaboration of B-glucuronidase that
deconjugates bilirubin leading to its
precipitation with calcium and palmi￾tate.3–7 Moreover, in the form of a
biofilm in which bacteria deposit them￾selves in complex patterns within a
mucopolysaccharide or glycocalyx infra￾structure, their presence has been asso￾ciated with progressive occlusion of
implanted medical devices which have
a lumen and infections resistant to
conventional courses of antibiotics.8
Plastic biliary stents, most often placed
for malignant obstructive jaundice, have
also been noted to occlude by virtue of
biofilm development.9 10 This biofilm
appears to be multidimensional and
consists of slime, immunoglobulins,
and other proteins in conjunction with
multiple bacteria species in the setting
of incomplete stent occlusion, and

interlaced within a bacterial matrix with
complete stent occlusion.4 9 11–13 In either
setting, the cholesterol concentration
within the stent is relatively low.
Attempts to improve prosthesis
patency by use of prophylactic antibio￾tics, antimucin drugs, ursodeoxycholic
acid, and changes in stent polymer have
invariably been disappointing.14–16 Clini￾cal stent occlusion leads to jaundice and
bacterial cholangitis, with polymicrobial
infections in up to 90% of patients in
several studies.2 11 17 Recently, similar
changes to include polymicrobial bac￾terial contamination and pancreatic
sepsis have been noted in patients with
indwelling pancreatic prostheses.18 19
In this issue of Gut, Swidsinski and
colleagues20 present elegant insights into
the presence of bacterial biofilm and the
viability of those bacteria in duodenal,
bile duct, and pancreatic duct mucosa as
well as in gall stones, common bile duct
stones, and biliary stents (see page 388).
Using oligonucleotide probes, fluores￾cence in situ hybridisation (FISH) stu￾dies were used to characterise bacterial
species within a biofilm and three
different parameters used to define
presumptive bacterial viability: (1)
amenability of cells to FISH versus ratio
of EUS 338 Cy3 positive and Gram
positive cells (DNA staining); (2) hybri￾disation time required to achieve fluor￾escence signal; and (3) time associated
with complete exhaustion of fluores￾cence. Decreased bacterial viability was
assumed in the presence of decreased
DNA staining, prolonged time to achieve
autofluorescence, and rapid exhaustion
of fluorescence staining.
Results included the presence of a
bacterial biofilm in brown/mixed gall
stones, findings supported by Stewart, et
al, who noted that 73% of pigmented
gall stones/bile duct stones contained
bacteria,4 data comparable with those
previously noted with black pigment
stones. In contrast, no biofilm was
noted within the mucosa of 20 gall
bladder or five bile duct walls or in the
elutes of 132 cholesterol gall stones that
were tested.
The latter data can be construed as a
different pathogenesis of cholesterol gall
stone formation (mucin eliciting choles￾terol crystal nucleation in supersatu￾rated bile).21 Alternatively, as the
authors suggest, it is possible that
cholesterol has the potential to inhibit
bacterial growth and may actually be a
novel mechanism to inhibit bacterial
growth within biofilms.
Perhaps the most intriguing findings
in the study were the presence of
bacterial attachment to pancreatic duct
epithelium in seven of nine patients
with chronic calcific pancreatitis as well
as the dramatic diminution in bacterial
viability of bacteria within a biofilm
with progressive biliary stent occlusion.
Our group has previously noted negative
bacterial cultures in patients with
chronic calcific pancreatitis at the time
of initial manipulation but an average of
3.4 enteric bacteria in aspirated juice
once a stent has been placed.18
Moreover, we have noted that pancrea￾tic sepsis can occur uncommonly and
that prosthesis occlusion is necessary
but not a sufficient explanation for why
the patient develops infectious compli￾cations of pancreatic endotherapy. The
findings by Swidsinski et al, that indivi￾duals with chronic calcific pancreatitis
who have undergone endoscopic ther￾apy develop complex biofilms within the
duct epithelium may mean nothing
more than exposure of the pancreatic
duct to duodenal flora by virtue of stent
placement or pancreatic sphincterot￾omy.20 If so, further work should
demonstrate that distal bile duct walls
have comparable bacterial biofilm in
individuals who have undergone biliary
sphincterotomy. The latter may or may
not play a role in the subsequent
development of common bile duct
stones seen in a subset of patients, even
those with widely patent sphincterot￾omies. Alternatively, the development of
biofilm in patients with chronic calcific
pancreatitis may be onerous and asso￾ciated with increased stone formation,
paralleling recent studies demonstrating
pancreatic stone protein within biliary
stents prior to complete occlusion.11
Perhaps the most interesting aspect of
the manuscript from a personal stand￾point was the finding that bacteria were
always above, and not below, the sludge
matrix in patients with variably
occluded biliary stents, and that bacter￾ial concentrations in patent, but nar￾rowed, stents were higher at the liver, as
opposed to the duodenal, end of the
prosthesis. In contrast, occluded stents,
as well as brown pigment and mixed
cholesterol gall stones, were associated
with decreased viable bacteria as detect￾able by FISH, and less than 10% of the
bacteria seen by Gram stain or auto￾fluorescence were amenable to FISH.
Had the authors simply cultured the bile
proximal to the stent, however, our
group as well as others would have
shown polymicrobial bacterial contam￾ination that may ultimately result in
‘‘stent flu’’ or frank cholangitis.2 17 18
The implied conclusion that choles￾terol stone formation may be a physio￾logical response to limit bacterial
biofilm development in bile and there￾fore useful to prevent biofilm develop￾ment and subsequent stent occlusion in
patients with biliary prostheses holds
some merit. More likely, however, chol￾esterol coated stents or pharmacological
manipulation of biliary excretion of
cholesterol would not preclude mucin
or protein deposition onto the inner
stent surface, findings noted by most
authors, prior to bacterial adherence.10–13
Nevertheless, Swidsinski et al have
added further fuel to the importance of
bacterial biofilms and the need to
delineate novel therapies to prevent
their initiation or preclude their propa￾gation.

Hepatocellular carcinoma
.......................................................................................
Predicting survival in early
hepatocellular carcinoma
S Ryder
...................................................................................
Are prognostic models for hepatocellular carcinoma useful in
predicting survival?
Over the past decade, non-surgical
therapies for hepatocellular car￾cinoma (HCC) occurring on a
background of cirrhosis have been
established as effective. Hepatic arterial
chemoembolisation has a proven survi￾val advantage in selected patient
groups,1 2 and there is now strong
evidence that ablative therapies, both
percutaneous alcohol injection3 and
radiofrequency ablation,4 have survival
benefit. In addition, HCC incidence is
increasing in the Western world, mainly
due to the hepatitis C epidemic and this
cancer now has an increasing impact on
health services.
A further change in the clinical
setting in which we encounter HCC
has occurred. The advent of ablative
therapy for HCC, which can destroy
tumour nodules up to approximately
5 cm in diameter, has focused the need
for detection of tumours at an early
stage in cirrhotic patients and has led to
the widespread use of screening in most
of the world. There is no doubt that
screening using ultrasound and a feto￾protein will detect HCC at a smaller
size.5 This has produced the need for
new prognostic models given that the
initial Okuda system6 was developed
some 30 years ago when the size of
HCCs at presentation was substantially
larger than today.
Thus prognostic models are important
from both a clinical perspective, of being
able to give patients and their relatives
accurate information on survival, and
from a research perspective, to assess
outcome of new therapies to help define
prognosis as accurately as possible. A
number of prognostic models for HCC
have been developed. All models have
been established in patient cohorts and
validated in other cohorts. All available
models have established two key factors
influencing outcome: how good is the
underlying liver function and how
extensive is the tumour.
In this issue of Gut, two articles
address this issue: one comparing cur￾rent prognostic models—Cancer of the
Liver in Italy (CLIP),7 Barcelona Clinic
Liver Cancer (BCLC),8 and the Okuda
system6
—in a single Italian centre,9 and
the other by Tateishi and colleagues10
assessing a new model developed in a
large cohort of Japanese patients (see
pages 411 and 419). It should be
emphasised that these are not natural
history based models; almost all
patients had therapy and some patients
had more than one treatment modality.
This form of modelling of survival
therefore reflects the outcome likely to
be seen in a real clinic setting but is
subject to the impact of many treatment
related effects on survival which may
not be reproducible in standard clinical
practice. It is also important to recognise
that these studies were aimed at prog￾nosis in patients with ‘‘early’’ HCC,
essentially presymptomatic patients
detected primarily by screening, and
therefore represent a subgroup of the
patient population.
The comparative study, in which 87%
of patients had screening detected HCC,9
showed that the long established Okuda
system is no longer useful in patients
with relatively early HCC; not surprising
given that Okuda I (early) is defined as
less than 50% of liver volume replaced
by tumour, which can still include
massive tumours which would be far
too large to treat with ablative therapy.
The other systems performed well, with
the best predictor being the BCLC
system. This has the disadvantage of
complexity; if strictly followed it
requires measurement of portal pressure
whereas the CLIP system is simple, uses
clinical parameters, and can be used at
the bedside. The accuracy of the CLIP
model is interesting as many of the
same parameters as Okuda (Child-Pugh
score and tumour extent) are used, yet
simple changes such as the classification
of tumours as uni or multifocal drama￾tically improves its predictive value over
Okuda. The Barcelona Clinic Model
(BCLC) presents features in more detail
with more categories, and uniquely
includes performance status, a factor
which has been key in predicting
response to treatment in most other
oncology settings. In large clinical trials
of therapy for HCC, the BCLC system
would seem to have significant advan￾tages in the level of detail of stratifica￾tion which is possible. From a clinical
perspective, the CLIP score will give
patients and clinicians an almost
equally reliable guide as to outlook.
The Japanese model was developed
entirely in patients treated by ablative
therapy, which meant that 93% of
patients had tumours smaller than
5 cm in diameter.10 Again, the analysis
produced a simple clinical algorithm
based on parameters known to reflect
liver function (bilirubin and albumin)
and tumour extent (size and number).
In this system, the ability of these
simple parameters to predict survival
was high. The overall five year survival
rates varied from almost 80% in patients
with good liver function and small
tumours to 15% in those with poor liver
and large or multiple tumours. This
model will require further validation;
perhaps its major drawback was its
validation in a cohort undergoing
another form of therapy (surgical resec￾tion). However, it was interesting that it
still predicted survival in a group being
treated with an alternative strategy,
suggesting that the parameters used
will hold true for most situations where
early HCC is being treated. The simpli￾city of this score is attractive; it only
takes into account tumour size and
number, albumin, and bilirubin, para￾meters which will be available for all
patients early on in the clinical assess￾ment. It differs from the CLIP score in
not using a fetoprotein and portal vein
invasion and excludes the other compo￾nents of the Child Pugh score. Further
validation of this system is required to

see if it performs as well as CLIP and
BCLC in other parts of the world, where
the aetiology of liver disease may be
different, and with treatment modalities
such as arterial chemoembolisation.
The overriding importance of tumour
size and liver function comes across in
all of these scoring systems. The real
difference between them is in which
components of liver function to include
and if tumour size and number is
enough or if other factors of tumour
extent such as portal invasion are better
markers. One area which has not been
examined specifically in the models is
the cause of death. In patients with
advanced liver disease the tumour may
be incidental and one would expect that
most would die of liver failure. In
patients with good liver function the
outlook may be much more determined
by tumour extension. In this latter
group, second tumour development
and the potential to treat the underlying
liver disease are also likely to affect
outcome; there is compelling evidence
that therapy for hepatitis C will reduce
cancer incidence.11
Perhaps the most important point
from both the comparative studies and
this new algorithm is that in using a
combination of ablative therapy and
chemoembolisation survival rates are
very high. The best comparator studies
were two natural history series in
untreated patients with small HCC and
good liver function at presentation
which showed an approximate three
year survival rate of 25%.12 13 The three
year survival in the Grieco study was
40% with a comparable aetiology of liver
disease. This is in contrast with overall
survival values which remain poor
worldwide, with only 5–8% five year
survival rates in the USA and Europe.
These values emphasise that good
results with a change in outcome can
be achieved but only if tumours are
diagnosed at an early stage on a back￾ground of good liver function. The
treatment option in patients with
decompensated liver disease is limited
to liver transplantation and there is no
possible therapy for those with both a
poorly functioning liver and a large HCC
because of the high tumour recurrence
rates post transplantation. In most parts
of the world, the typical patient with
HCC still presents with advanced dis￾ease which explains the poor overall
survival figures. Can we improve the
situation and detect more HCC at a
treatable stage? Screening of high risk
cirrhotic patients has gained wide
acceptance and there is clear evidence
that such strategies can detect cancers
of a smaller size5 14; this can translate
into more treatable HCC with survival
rates as high as seen in these two
cohorts.15 What has not been established
is if this strategy can alter overall
survival, and if the costs, both finan￾cially and psychologically, are worth￾while. The main problems with
screening are that a significant minority
of HCC patients present with their
tumour at the same time as the present
with their underlying liver disease, and
that the screening tests (a fetoprotein
and ultrasound) are either relatively
insensitive for small HCC or very opera￾tor dependant. The risk of HCC varies
according to sex and the cause of
cirrhosis, adding further complexity to
the debate. There is a need for studies
which better identify patients at risk
and examine new modalities of screen￾ing, such as magnetic resonance ima￾ging. However, there is no doubt that if
small HCC are detected they can be
treated. We also have prognostic models
which allow both clinical prediction of
outcome and clinical trials of therapy to
be undertaken.
