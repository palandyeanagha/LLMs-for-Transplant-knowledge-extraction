Magnet-assisted endoscopic choledochoduodenostomy in anomalous opening
of the common bile duct into the duodenal bulb
Variations of the biliary opening into the
enteral lumen may cause conditions such
as biliary colic, recurrent cholangitis, and
pneumobilia, among others [1, 2]. Sur￾gery is the main treatment, but it has
high morbidity and mortality rates. Mag￾netic compression anastomosis (MCA) is
a novel technique that has been widely
applied in the gastrointestinal system
[3]. Herein, we present a patient with an
anomalous biliary opening that was treat￾ed with magnet-assisted endoscopic cho￾ledochoduodenostomy (MECD), which
was based on the MCA technique.
A 36-year-old man with a history of bili￾ary sepsis was referred to our clinic with
the need for recurrent endoscopic retro￾grade cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
procedures. Previous ERCP examinations
had demonstrated an anomalous open￾ing of the common bile duct (CBD) into
the duodenal bulb, which led to a hook￾shaped narrowing of the distal CBD
(▶Fig. 1). Previous interventions using
ERCP had been difficult to perform
owing to apical bulb narrowing and had
remained inconclusive.
It was decided to perform MECD (▶Fig. 2;
▶Video 1) to avoid the possible compli￾cations of bilioenteric diversion surgery.
A 3.5 × 10-mm N35 Neodymium magnet
was inserted into the distally narrowed
CBD using the through-the-scope tech￾nique. Subsequently, a 10 × 10-mm N35
Neodymium magnet was inserted into
the duodenal bulb endoscopically with
the help of a snare. Fluoroscopy con￾firmed the alignment of the magnets
(▶Fig. 3 a). After 20 days, the magnets
were seen to be coupled on fluoroscopy
(▶Fig. 3 b) and they were removed endo￾scopically (▶Fig. 4). Cannulation and
radiocontrast examination of this newly
formed choledochoduodenal fistula
demonstrated a well-formed tract from
the biliary system through to the duode￾num. A coated metal stent was inserted
to preserve and enlarge the new opening.
In conclusion, avoidance of the hook￾shaped distal narrowing and mainte￾nance of a free passage for bile with the
MECD technique protected the patient
from future attacks stemming from bili￾ary stasis, as well as from the complica￾Video 1 Anomalous opening of the common bile duct into the duodenal bulb that has
caused recurrent choledocholithiasis treated with a new method, magnet-assisted chole￾dochoduodenostomy.

the best of our knowledge, the MECD
technique was used for the first time in
the presented case.
