Abstract
Background: Chronic bird fancier’s lung (BFL) has often been
misdiagnosed as one of the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs).
Methods: To define the clinical and pathological characteristics of
chronic BFL, 26 patients with chronic BFL from whom a surgical
lung biopsy specimen was taken between October 1992 and June
2001 were evaluated. The histopathological characteristics of the
surgical lung biopsy specimens were examined and correlations
between the histopathology and clinical characteristics were
analysed. The quality of chronic inflammatory and fibrotic changes
was expressed according to the 2002 ATS/ERS consensus
classification of IIPs.
Results: Two patients were diagnosed as having bronchiolitis
obliterans organising pneumonia (BOOP)-like lesions, five as having
cellular non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP)-like lesions, and
eight as having fibrotic NSIP-like lesions. The other 11 patients
were considered to have usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP)-like
lesions because of the temporal heterogeneous appearances of the
fibrotic changes. However, fibrosis in these patients had developed
in centrilobular as well as perilobular areas, suggestive of
hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Nineteen patients (73.1%) had


multinucleated giant cells, often with cholesterol clefts, while only
five patients (19.2%) had granulomas. Patients with BOOP-like or
cellular NSIP-like lesions tended to have recurrent acute episodes,
whereas patients with UIP-like lesions had an insidious onset.
Patients with BOOP-like or cellular NSIP-like lesions had a more
favourable outcome than those with fibrotic NSIP-like and UIP-like
lesions.
Conclusions: The qualities of chronic inflammatory and fibrotic
lesions vary significantly among patients with chronic BFL but
correlate with clinical features and prognosis.
