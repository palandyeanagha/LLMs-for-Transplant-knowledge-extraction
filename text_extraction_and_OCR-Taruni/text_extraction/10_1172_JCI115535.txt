Abstract
Plasma net cholesteryl ester (CE) transfer and optimum cho￾lesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity were determined
in primary hypertriglyceridemic (a = 11) and normolipidemic
(a = 15) individuals. The hypertriglyceridemic group demon￾strated threefold greater net CE transfer leading to enhanced
accumulation of CE in VLDL. This increased net transfer was
not accompanied by a change in CETP activity. In normolipide￾mia, but not in hypertriglyceridemia, net CE transfer correlated
with VLDL triglyceride (r = 0.92, P < 0.001). In contrast, net
CE transfer in hypertriglyceridemia, but not in normolipide￾mia, correlated with CETP activity (r = 0.73, P< 0.01). Correc￾tion of hypertriglyceridemia with bezafibrate reduced net CE
transfer towards normal and restored the correlation with
VLDL triglyceride (r = 0.90, P < 0.005) while suppressing the
correlation with CETP activity. That net CE transfer depends
on VLDL concentration was confirmed by an increase of net CE
transfer in normolipidemic plasma supplemented with purified
VLDL. Supplementation of purified CETP to normolipidemic
plasma did not stimulate net CE transfer. In contrast, net CE
transfer was enhanced by addition of CETP to both plasma
supplemented with VLDL and hypertriglyceridemic plasma.
Thus, in normal subjects, VLDL concentration determines the
rate of net CE transfer. CETP becomes rate limiting as VLDL
concentration increases, i.e, in hypertriglyceridemia. (J. Clin.

teins by cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) (1, 2; see ref. 3
for review). Kinetic data (4) and in vitro studies (5) indicate
that transfer of HDL CE, derived from the lecithin-cholesterol
acyltransferase (LCAT) reaction, to lower density, apo B-con￾taining lipoproteins is an important route for clearance ofHDL
CE. However, the absence of premature atherosclerosis in sub￾jects with markedly increased HDL levels caused by CETP
deficiency (null phenotype) (6, 7) suggests that the action of
CETP could promote atherogenesis. Low plasma HDL con￾centration, which is an important predictor of coronary heart
disease risk (8-10), is commonly observed in hypertriglyceride￾mic subjects. Since HDL cholesterol concentration is inversely
related to plasma Tg levels (1 1, 12), the low HDL cholesterol
levels in hypertriglyceridemia could result from an increased
rate of CE transfer from HDL to Tg-rich lipoproteins.
Consistent with this analysis, previous studies have shown
that compared to normal, hypertriglyceridemic HDL are CE
depleted and Tg enriched, while VLDL are enriched with CE
(13). In contrast, plasma incubation studies have shown that in
hypertriglyceridemic subjects with vascular disease, the rate of
net CE transfer from HDL to apo B-containing lipoproteins is
reduced (5). This observation suggests that the apoB-contain￾ing lipoproteins of these subjects display impaired ability to
accept CE from HDL (5, 14). Recent investigations, however,
have shown that apo B-containing lipoproteins of hypertri￾glyceridemic subjects accept HDL CE at a rate comparable
with normal subjects (15). Also, net CE transfer has been re￾ported to be enhanced in other conditions ofhypertriglyceride￾mia, i.e., dysbetalipoproteinemia (16), and postprandial lipe￾mia (17, 18). To address this controversial issue, we investi￾gated the mechanism of CETP-mediated transfer of CE in a
homogeneous group of subjects with primary hypertriglyceri￾demia, and in a control group of normolipidemic subjects
matched for age and sex.
In this paper, we report that in primary hypertriglyceride￾mia, the rate of CE accumulation in VLDL is increased three￾fold compared to normolipidemia. This enhanced net CE
transfer does not result from a change in optimum CETP activ￾ity, but rather from an increase in VLDL concentration.

Subjects. This study involved the participation of informed, con￾senting adult human subjects. Hypertriglyceridemic patients (VLDL
Tg > 1.5 mmol/liter or 130 mg/dl) attending Leeds General Infirmary
Lipid Clinic, Leeds, England, were screened for secondary causes of
hyperlipidemia. Subjects with glucose intolerance, liver or kidney dis￾ease, thyroid dysfunction, or alcoholism were excluded. To ensure a
homogeneous population, those individuals with raised LDL (1.006
< d < 1.063 g/ml) cholesterol concentration (> 4.2 mmol/liter or 160
mg/dl) were also excluded from the study. Ofthe I1 selected hypertri￾glyceridemic subjects, none had taken lipid-active medication in the
previous four months, and each was following lipid clinic dietary guid￾ance. 8 of these 11 subjects, diagnosed with (n = 4) or having family
history of (n = 4) cardiovascular disease, were restudied after 6 wk
treatment with bezafibrate (200 mg, three times per day). The criterion
for positive family history was diagnosis of cardiovascular disease in
first or second degree relatives: one before age 50, two before age 60, or
three before age 65. 15 normolipidemic control subjects (LDL choles￾terol . 4.2 mmol/liter, and VLDL Tg . 1.2 mmol/liter or 110 mg/dl)
were matched for age and sex.
Sample preparation. After an overnight fast, blood was collected
into tubes containing disodium EDTA (final concentration, 1 mg/ml)
at 4VC. Aprotinin (0.14 IU/ml) and E600 (di-ethyl 4-nitrophenyl phos￾phate) (2 mM, final concentration) were added to all plasma samples to
inhibit protease and LCAT activities, respectively.
Measurement oflipids and apoproteins. Concentrations of plasma
and lipoprotein total cholesterol, unesterified cholesterol, and triglycer￾ide were measured using enzymatic reagents, and are expressed as mil￾limoles per liter using molecular weights of 387 for cholesterol and 885
for triglyceride. CE was calculated as the difference between measured
total and unesterified cholesterol concentrations. HDL total and unes￾terified cholesterol were determined in plasma after precipitation of
apo B-containing lipoproteins with sodium heparin (250 U/ml plasma)
and MnCl2 (92 mM, final concentration) at 4°C (19). To prevent inter￾ference of excess manganese ions with these lipid determinations, the
enzymatic reagents were first supplemented with 8 mM EDTA. Con￾centrations of apoproteins Al and B in plasma were determined by
immunoturbidimetric methods. Protein was determined by the
method of Lowry et al. (20) using BSA as standard.
Isolation of lipoprotein fractions. VLDL and LDL were obtained
from individual plasma samples (1-1.5 ml) by sequential ultracentrifu￾gation. VLDL (d < 1.006 g/ml) was isolated using a rotor (TFT1 80.4;
Sorvall Instruments Div., part ofDuPont Co., Newton, CT) at 310,000
g for 4 h 10 min at4C. LDL (1.006 < d < 1.063 g/ml) was isolated by a
second centrifugation at 265,000 g for 7 h 10 min at 4°C.
Lipoproteins isolated for preparative purposes were obtained by
sequential ultracentrifugation using a rotor (Ti5O.2; Beckman Instru￾ments, Fullerton, CA) at 145,000 gand 4C: VLDL (d < 1.006 g/ml, 18
h), LDL (1.006 < d < 1.063 g/ml, 24 h), HDL (1.063 < d < 1.21 g/ml,
48 h). Each fraction was concentrated by subsequent flotation using a
rotor (SW40; Beckman Instruments) at 4°C. Isolated fractions were
dialyzed against buffer containing 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM
EDTA, pH 7.4, and then stored at 4°C in the presence of aprotinin
(0.14 IU/ml). All preparations were used within 48 h.
Determination of net CE transfer in plasma. Net CE transfer was
measured as the change of CE concentration in VLDL and LDL frac￾tions after in vitro incubation of plasma, unless otherwise indicated.
Fresh plasma samples (1-1.5 ml) capped under nitrogen were incu￾bated at 37°C for the indicated times, and the reaction was terminated
by chilling on ice. VLDL and LDL fractions were isolated as described
above. Each sample was analyzed twice and all lipid measurements
were in quadruplicate, unless otherwise indicated. Since CETP activity
is negligible at 4°C (21), corresponding samples incubated at this tem￾perature served as controls. Fig. 1 shows the linearity with time of net
CE transfer to VLDL in normolipidemic and hypertriglyceridemic
plasma.
Determination ofoptimum CETP activity. CETP activity was mea￾sured under conditions that optimize the unidirectional movement of
radiolabeled CE between donor (HDL) and acceptor (LDL), i.e., as a

HDL cholesterol 1.38 mmol/liter (53 mg/dl). Hypertriglyceridemic

and 8 h in the presence of the LCAT inhibitor, E600 (final concen￾tration, 2 mM). VLDL (d < 1.006 g/ml) was isolated from each ali￾quot using a Sorvall TFT 80.4 rotor at 310,000 g for 4 h 10 min at

measure of plasma CETP mass. 3H-CE-HDL3 (1.125 < d < 1.21 g/ml)
were prepared according to Albers et al. (2). Plasma (5 JAl) was incu￾bated for 3 h at 370C with 3H-CE-HDL3 (25 nmol CE) and unlabeled
LDL (500 nmol CE) in buffer containing 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 2
mM EDTA, pH 7.4 (final vol, 100 Ml). After incubation, LDL was
removed by heparin/MnCI2 precipitation, and CETP activity was de￾termined as the loss of3H-CE from the HDL supernatant, compared to
a blank incubated for the same time without plasma. Each plasma and
blank was assayed in quadruplicate. Transfer of labeled substrate did
not exceed 25% per incubation. Fig. 2 shows that under the conditions
described, movement of 3H-CE from donor to acceptor lipoproteins
was dependent on CETP mass (Fig. 2 A) and time of incubation
(Fig. 2 B).
Purification ofCETP. Human plasma CETP was purified 500-fold
from blood bank plasma (800 ml). Plasma (d = 1.21 g/ml) was centri￾fuged in a rotor (TiSO.2; Beckman) at 145,000 g for 48 h at 40C. The
clear middle zone, which contained > 70% oftotal plasma CETP activ￾ity, was directly applied to a 45 X 2.5 cm column of phenyl-Sepharose
CL4B equilibrated in 10 mM Tris, 3 M NaCl, pH 7.4. The column was
washed with 5 bed vol ofbuffer containing 10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl,
pH 7.4. Bound material was then eluted with distilled water containing
3 mM sodium azide, pH 7.4. Fractions with CETP activity were
pooled, dialyzed against 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, and then applied to a 25
X 1.5 cm column ofDEAE Sepharose CL6B equilibrated with the same
buffer. Elution was with a linear gradient (600 ml) of0-250 mM NaCl
in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4. CETP-containing fractions, which eluted be￾tween 95 and 130 mM NaCl, were pooled and concentrated by nega￾tive pressure dialysis (Bio-Molecular Dynamics, Beaverton, OR).
Buffers used in the purification contained 2 mM EDTA, and all proce￾dures were at 4°C. The partially purified CETP (optimum CETP activ￾ity: 750 nmol CE transferred/h -mg protein) in buffer containing 10

Statistical analyses. Statistical significance of the differences be￾tween two means was determined by two-tailed Student's t test for
paired or unpaired samples as indicated. Correlations were analyzed
using linear Pearson correlation coefficient.
Results
Increased net CE transfer in hypertriglyceridemic subjects does
not result from changes in CETP activity. Compared to the
normolipidemic group, hypertriglyceridemic subjects showed
significantly higher VLDL Tg and significantly lower HDLcho￾lesterol (Table I). Two parameters were determined to assess
neutral lipid redistribution between lipoprotein subfractions.
Net CE transfer was measured as the change of CE concentra￾tion in VLDL and LDL fractions following whole plasma incu￾bations. Plasma optimum CETP activity was measured under
conditions that minimize the relative effects of donor and ac￾ceptor lipoproteins. The latter parameter provides a measure of
CETP mass (23). In the hypertriglyceridemic group, net CE
transfer was enhanced compared to normolipidemic subjects
leading to a threefold increased accumulation of CE in VLDL
(Table I). Net CE transfer to LDL was not significantly in￾creased in hypertriglyceridemia. For both normolipidemic and
hypertriglyceridemic subjects, net CE transfer to VLDL was
accompanied by an equivalent molar net Tg transfer from
VLDL (data not shown). There was no statistically significant
increase in optimum CETP activity in hypertriglyceridemic
plasma. These data suggested that net transfer of neutral lipids
is accelerated in hypertriglyceridemia, but does not result from
an increase in plasma CETP mass.
Net CE transfer correlates with plasma VLDL triglyceride
concentration only in the normolipidemic group. The observa￾tion that CETP activity is normal in hypertriglyceridemia led
us to question the ability of lipoprotein neutral lipid levels to
modulate the rate of net CE transfer. Since net CE transfer to
LDL was small, and not statistically different between the two
groups studied, we analyzed potential relationships of net CE
transfer with lipoprotein CE donor (HDL) and acceptor
(VLDL) concentrations. A positive linear correlation (r = 0.92,
P < 0.001) between net CE transfer and VLDL Tg was found in
the normolipidemic group (Fig. 3 A) but not in the hypertri￾glyceridemic group (Fig. 3 B). The correlation observed in nor￾molipidemic subjects is consistent with data reported previ￾ously in 15 other normolipidemic controls (24). No statistically
significant correlation could be found in either group, between
net CE transfer and HDL CE concentration (Fig. 3, C and D).
These results suggested that in normolipidemia, the concentra￾tion of CE acceptor (VLDL), rather than CE donor (HDL),
determines the rate of net CE transfer. For the hypertriglyceri￾demic group, however, the absence of significant correlations
between net CE transfer and either acceptor or donor lipopro￾tein lipid concentrations indicated that the rate of net CE
transfer is independent of plasma lipid levels in these subjects.
Net CE transfer correlates with CETP activity only in the
hypertriglyceridemic group. We next questioned whether in hy￾pertriglyceridemia the rate of net CE transfer is related to
CETP mass. Fig. 4 shows that, in contrast with the normolipi￾demic group (Fig. 4 A), the hypertriglyceridemic group (Fig. 4
B) displayed a positive significant correlation between net CE
transfer and optimum CETP activity. Taken together, these
observations led us to hypothesize that: (a) the rate of net CE
transfer in normolipidemia is limited by Tg-rich acceptor-lipo￾protein concentration; and (b) in hypertriglyceridemia, en￾hanced net CE transfer as a result of raised VLDL concentra￾tion, is limited by the normal CETP mass in these subjects.
Supplementation of normolipidemic plasma with normal
VLDL increases net CE transfer. To test whether net CE
transfer is determined by VLDL concentration, we created
conditions of hypertriglyceridemia in vitro by supplementing

net CE transfer in conditions of excess Tg-rich acceptor, nor￾molipidemic plasma (VLDL Tg = 0.38 mmol/liter, 34 mg/dl)
and the same plasma enriched with normal VLDL (VLDL Tg
= 5 mmol/liter, 440 mg/dl) were supplemented with partially
purified CETP. Fig. 6 shows that addition of CETP enhanced
net CE transfer in VLDL-enriched plasma, but not in normoli￾pidemic plasma. The inset ofFig. 6 demonstrates that the opti￾mum CETP activities in both VLDL-rich and normal plasma
increased linearly with the addition of CETP. Thus, the inabil￾ity of CETP to increase net CE transfer in normal plasma is
consistent with this protein being in excess in normolipidemic
subjects.

threefold faster than in normolipidemic individuals. In either
group, CE did not accumulate in LDL. Our findings also show
that optimum CETP activity, which provides a measure of
CETP mass (23) is not concomitantly increased in hypertri￾glyceridemic plasma. This latter finding is in agreement with
the observation that hypertriglyceridemic subjects have normal
CETP mass as measured by radioimmunoassay (23).
Investigation of the factors determining net CE transfer in
normolipidemic and hypertriglyceridemic subjects provided a
mechanism to explain the dissociation between rate of net CE
transfer and CETP mass. Correlation analysis indicated that a
direct relationship exists between plasma VLDL concentration
and net CE transfer in normolipidemic subjects. The analysis
further suggested that, in contrast to normal subjects, net CE
transfer in hypertriglyceridemia is determined by CETP mass.
A possible explanation for these different correlations was that
in normolipidemia, CETP is in excess and VLDL concentra￾tion (i.e., availability of Tg) limits the rate of net CE transfer,
while in hypertriglyceridemia, where VLDL concentration is
increased, net CE transfer is dependent on CETP mass.

1.09 mmol/liter (42 mg/dl); subject 2 (.)-cholesterol 3.3 mmol/liter
(128 mg/dl), Tg 0.54 mmol/liter (48 mg/dl), and HDL cholesterol
1.21 mmol/liter (47 mg/dl). Plasma CETP activities were 216 and 143
nmol/ml * h, respectively. l-ml aliquots from subjects 1 and 2 were
incubated at 37°C for 2 h with or without increasing amounts of
VLDL isolated from subject 1. The LCAT inhibitor, E600 (2 mM,
final concentration) was included in the assay and the final volume
was adjusted to 1.2 ml. Net CE transfer was measured as the loss of
CE from the d > 1.006 g/ml (HDL + LDL) fraction. Corresponding
samples incubated at 4°C served as controls. Each point represents
the mean±SD of quadruplicate determinations.
in the eight subjects before and after treatment. The signifi￾cances ofthese correlations before treatment were not different
from those observed in the 11 original subjects (Figs. 3 and 4).
Fig. 8 shows the correlations after bezafibrate treatment. The
correlation between net CE transfer and optimum CETP activ￾ity did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 8 A), contrasting
with the significant correlation observed prior to treatment.
Concomitantly, a statistically significant correlation between
net CE transfer and plasma VLDL Tg concentration was ob￾served after bezafibrate treatment (Fig. 8 B). The lack of corre￾lation between net CE transfer and HDL CE observed before
bezafibrate, persisted after therapy (Fig. 8 C). This showed that
correction of hypertriglyceridemia with bezafibrate suppresses
the relationship of net CE transfer with CETP activity, and
restores the relationship with plasma VLDL Tg. These data
therefore further support the hypothesis that Tg-rich lipopro￾tein concentration determines the rate of net CE transfer in
normolipidemia, while CETP limits net CE transfer in the pres￾ence of high VLDL concentrations.

The possibility that VLDL concentration limits net CE

supplementation of plasma with purified VLDL increased net
CE transfer. Conversely, the hypothesis that CETP is rate limit￾ing in hypertriglyceridemia was verified by supplementation of

0.61 mmol/liter (54 mg/dl), HDL cholesterol 1.20 mmol/liter (46

supplemented with increasing concentrations ofautologous HDL (A)
or LDL (B) as indicated, and incubated at 37°C for 4 h. Separate ali￾quots of plasma were enriched to 5 mmol/liter VLDL Tg either with￾out (e) or with (,) addition of purified CETP (twofold activity of
original plasma), then supplemented with increasing concentrations
of HDL or LDL and incubated at 37°C for 2 h. All samples (1.4 ml,
final vol) contained 2 mM E600 as LCAT inhibitor. After incubation,
net CE transfer was measured as the increase ofCE in the d < 1.006
g/ml fraction (VLDL). Means±SD are shown for quadruplicate de￾terminations except where SD bars are concealed by the symbols.

normal and VLDL-enriched plasma with purified CETP. In￾creasing the mass of CETP in normolipidemic plasma had no
effect on net CE transfer to VLDL. In contrast, the same quan￾tity of CETP added to VLDL-enriched plasma increased net
CE transfer more than twofold. The rate-limiting effect of
CETP was also demonstrated directly in hypertriglyceridemia.
Increasing the mass ofCETP in plasma from hypertriglyceride￾mic subjects significantly enhanced the initially high rate of net
CE transfer. Further evidence for this interpretation is found in
data obtained from hypertriglyceridemic subjects treated with
bezafibrate. Correction of hypertriglyceridemia reduced net
CE transfer towards normal levels but did not affect optimum
CETP activity. After this treatment, linear correlation between
net CE transfer and VLDL concentration was restored as in the
normolipidemic group, while the preexisting correlation be￾tween net CE transfer and optimum CETP activity was no
longer significant. Our investigations therefore indicate that in
normolipidemia, the concentration of Tg-rich lipoproteins in
plasma provides the driving force for net CE transfer, while in
hypertriglyceridemia, the enhanced rate of net transfer is lim￾ited by CETP mass. This suggests that, for hypertriglyceridemic
subjects, dietary (23) or genetic (25) factors affecting CETP
expression could influence the individual variation in net CE
transfer.
We have demonstrated in this study that stimulation of net
CE transfer to the same extent as that observed in hypertriglyc￾eridemia was achieved by supplementation of normal VLDL
to normal plasma. Alterations in VLDL composition are there￾fore not required for these particles to increase net CE transfer.
This does not exclude that the reported enrichment of hyper￾triglyceridemic VLDL with unesterified cholesterol (13, 26)
could modulate the ability of such particles to accumulate
CE (27).
The observation that VLDL concentration drives net CE
transfer provides a mechanism to explain the correlations be￾tween plasma Tg concentration and lipoprotein core-lipid
compositional abnormalities in hypertriglyceridemia, as well
as the reversion of these compositional changes towards nor￾2064 C. J. Mann, F. T. Yen, A. M. Grant, and B. E. Bihain

mal after reduction of VLDL concentration by administration
of bezafibrate (13). Although plasma HDL CE concentration
did not correlate with net CE transfer in either the normolipi￾demic or the hypertriglyceridemic group, a significant inverse
correlation (r = -0.69, P < 0.001) was observed when data
from both groups were pooled. Thus, accelerated net CE
transfer as a result of increased VLDL concentration could
explain differences in HDL CE concentration between, but not
within, the two groups.
It must also be considered that determination of net CE
transfer in incubated plasma reflects only partially the physio￾logical transfer of neutral lipid. Indeed, the role of factors, e.g.,
lipolysis which has been shown to enhance CETP activity (28),
is not taken into account in such an assay. Therefore, the possi￾bility remains that other parameters contribute in vivo to the
regulation of net CE transfer.
In agreement with the present study, increased plasma net
CE transfer has been reported in other conditions of hypertri￾glyceridemia. Compared to fasting normal subjects, net CE
transfer was enhanced threefold in dysbetalipoproteinemia
(type III hyperlipidemia) (16), and two to threefold during
postprandial lipemia (17, 18). In both conditions, the enhanced
net CE transfer was attributed to a combined stimulatory effect
of hypertriglyceridemia and increased activity of CETP (16,
18). Our conclusions, however, are not consistent with the in￾terpretation that net CE transfer is reduced or unchanged in
hypertriglyceridemia (5). This discrepancy most likely results
from the fact that hypertriglyceridemic groups studied in the
previous investigation were small and included subjects with
secondary hypertriglyceridemia, as well as individuals receiv￾ing lipid-active drugs or with high plasma cholesterol.
In this report, we clarify the mechanisms through which a
potentially independent atherogenic risk factor, i.e., CETP, af￾fects lipoprotein core composition in hypertriglyceridemia.
This analysis led us to propose that the driving force for net CE
transfer is VLDL. As VLDL concentration increases, CETP
becomes rate-limiting. Thus, in hypertriglyceridemia, net CE
transfer is limited by CETP and could therefore be affected by
factors modulating CETP concentration. We postulate that the
relative excess of CETP in plasma of overnight fasted normoli￾pidemic subjects may provide the reserve to satisfy greater need
for transfer of neutral lipids during the postprandial stage.
