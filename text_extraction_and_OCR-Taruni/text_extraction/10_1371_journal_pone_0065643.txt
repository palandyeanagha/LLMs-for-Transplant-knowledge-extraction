Abstract
Exercise capacity and survival of patients with IPF is potentially impaired by pulmonary hypertension. This study aims to
investigate diagnostic and prognostic properties of gas exchange during exercise and lung function in IPF patients with or
without pulmonary hypertension. In a multicentre setting, patients with IPF underwent right heart catheterization,
cardiopulmonary exercise and lung function testing during their initial evaluation. Mortality follow up was
evaluated. Seventy-three of 135 patients [82 males; median age of 64 (56; 72 years)] with IPF had pulmonary
hypertension as assessed by right heart catheterization [median mean pulmonary arterial pressure 34 (27; 43) mmHg]. The
presence of pulmonary hypertension was best predicted by gas exchange efficiency for carbon dioxide (cut off $152%
predicted; area under the curve 0.94) and peak oxygen uptake (#56% predicted; 0.83), followed by diffusing capacity.
Resting lung volumes did not predict pulmonary hypertension. Survival was best predicted by the presence of pulmonary
hypertension, followed by peak oxygen uptake [HR 0.96 (0.93; 0.98)]. Pulmonary hypertension in IPF patients is best
predicted by gas exchange efficiency during exercise and peak oxygen uptake. In addition to invasively measured
pulmonary arterial pressure, oxygen uptake at peak exercise predicts survival in this patient population.

Introduction
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating interstitial
lung disease usually associated with poor survival [1,2]. Although
respiratory failure is the most frequent cause of death in IPF,
mortality is also driven by several comorbidities [2]. Amongst
others, there has been a growing appreciation of interceding
pulmonary hypertension (PH) in IPF as a important comorbidity
with prognostic implications [3,4,5,6]. Depending on its severity,
PH may tremendously reduce life expectancy in IPF to less than
one year [3]. The severity of lung volume restriction in IPF is well
quantified by forced vital capacity (FVC). The degree of FVC
reduction as well as FVC decline over time reliably predicts
survival in patients with mild to moderate IPF [7], but little is
known on how lung volume assessment may mirror circulatory
limitations in patients with interceding PH as well.
Impaired pulmonary vascular blood flow due to PH results in
reduced exercise capacity and disproportional dyspnoea
[6,8,9,10]. Peak oxygen uptake (peakVO2) assessed by cardiopul￾monary exercise testing (CPET) as well as 6 minute walk distance
are significantly impacted by PH [6,8,11]. If IPF is complicated by
PH, impaired exercise capacity is usually associated with gas
exchange inefficiency for carbon dioxide at rest and during
exercise, potentially explaining exaggerated dyspnoea [8]. Venti￾lation to carbon dioxide output ratio (VE/VCO2) as a measure of
gas exchange efficiency has been shown to be impaired depending
on the severity of interceding PH – independent of FVC reduction
[8,9]. However, neither diagnostic nor prognostic implications
have been reported for exercise related gas exchange measures.
Since transthoracic echocardiography as one standard tool to
suspect PH reveals impaired diagnostic accuracy in IPF, additional
non-invasive measures predicting interceding PH in this patient
populations are of potential interest [12].
The objective of this study is to evaluate lung function variables,
exercise capacity and gas exchange efficiency in patients with
interceding PH in IPF. As a reference population, IPF patients
without PH will be investigated. First, the study aims to describe
non-invasive predictive measures for the presence of PH. Second,
potential prognostic implications of these measures will be
assessed.
Methods
Ethics statement
All subjects gave written informed consent. The protocol for
investigations, data acquisition and analysis was approved by the
local Ethics Committee (Ethics committee of the University of
Greifswald, BB 87/11).

Study population
The study population consist of 135 patients (82 male) with
definitive IPF. The diagnoses of definitive IPF were in accordance
to current guidelines [13]. All analyses base on a prospectively
designed database for IPF patients of the University of Greifswald.
The local assessment was obtained at tertiary centres for
pulmonary hypertension and IPF in Berlin, Dresden and
Greifswald, Germany between 2004 and 2011. All subjects
underwent transthoracic echocardiography, right heart catheter￾ization, pulmonary function testing (PFT), diffusing capacity for
carbon monoxide and CPET. The mortality follow up was
terminated in August 2011. For the prognostic assessment, death
and lung transplantation were considered as endpoints.
Subjects with evidence of left heart disease [echocardiography
and/or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PWP) .14 mmHg
by right heart catheterization [14]], diseases other than IPF and/
or PH resulting in a life expectancy of less than 24 months or
inability to perform CPET due to orthopaedic or neurological
impairments were excluded.
Pulmonary hypertension was defined as an increase in mean
pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) to $25 mmHg assessed by
right heart catheterization [14]. Right heart catheterization was
done by Swan-Ganz catheter via Jugular vein at rest in a lying
position.
Lung function and Exercise testing
Immediately prior to CPET, each subject underwent PFT
including spirometry, body chamber and diffusing capacity
evaluation for carbon monoxide (TLCO and KCO as corrected
for alveolar surface area) according to current guidelines
[15,16,17]. Pulmonary function testing was conducted using a
body chamber equipped with a pneumotachograph (VIASYS
Healthcare, MasterScreen Body/Diff., JAEGER, Hoechberg,
Germany) which meets the American Thoracic Society (ATS)
criteria [18].
For the purpose of this study, the following PFT variables were
investigated: forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) in
litres (L), FVC in L, FEV1/FVC ratio, inspiratory vital capacity
(IVC) in L, total lung capacity (TLC) in L and KCO in mmol/
min/kPa/L.
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing was performed with a
physician in attendance according to a modified Jones protocol
[19] using a calibrated electromagnetically braked cycle ergometer
(Ergoselect 100, Ergoline, Germany). Gas exchange and ventila￾tory variables were analysed breath by breath using a VIASYS
HEALTHCARE system (Oxycon Pro, Combitox mask) which
had been recalibrated just prior to each test. 12-lead ECG’s were
recorded during rest and every minute thereafter; pulse oximetry
was monitored continuously; and blood pressure was obtained by
cuff sphygmomanometer every two minutes. Prior to the test,
patients were encouraged to reach maximal exhaustion; during
exercise no further motivation was utilised. All tests were
performed according to current guidelines for CPET [20,21].
Values for minute ventilation (VE), tidal volume (Vt), VO2, and
carbon dioxide output (VCO2) were acquired on a breath-by￾breath basis and averaged over 20 s intervals. PeakVO2 was
defined as the highest 20-s average of VO2 in the last minute of the
exercise test. Ventilatory efficiency, expressed as the relation of VE
and VCO2, was defined as the slope of the regression of both
parameters excluding excess hyperventilation at the end of
exercise (VE vs. VCO2 slope). The anaerobic threshold (AT)
was determined according to Wasserman et al and quantified as
oxygen uptake at AT (VO2@AT) [22]. The breathing reserve
(VE/MVV) was calculated as maximal VE in relation to maximal
voluntary ventilation (MVV). MVV was calculated by FEV1641.
At peak exercise, dynamic flow-volume loops were documented
and evaluated for inspiratory capacity (IC). The manoeuvre was
assessed for peak Vt in relation to peak exercise IC (Vt/IC) [8].
The following CPET variables were assessed for the purpose of
this investigation: peakVO2 and VO2@AT (mL/min), VE vs.
VCO2 slope, VEmax and Vtmax (L),m Vtmax/IC and VE/MVV.
Statistical analysis
Besides absolute values relative % predicted values were
analysed. The following sets of reference were applied to calculate
% predicted values (pred): PFT by Koch et al [23], TLC by Hansen
[24], KCO by Gla¨ ser et al [25], exercise variables by Wasserman
et al, Koch et al and Gla¨ ser et al [22,26,27,28].
Predicting prognosis based on variables for age, sex, FEV1pred,
FVCpred, KCOpred, peakVO2pred, VO2@ATpred and VE vs.
VCO2 slopepred. In addition, absolute values of all variables were
analysed.
Continuous data are expressed as median (25th and 75th
quartile). The Mann-Whitney U-test (continuous data) or X-test
(nominal data) were used for comparison of IPF patients with PH
or without PH. Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed
to assess the association between pulmonary variables and the end
point. Hazards ratios and 95% confidence intervals for risk factors
as well as levels for x2
-test (likelihood ratio test) are given. Kaplan
Meier cumulative survival plots were constructed (SPSS version
20.0). Differences in survival were analyzed by log-rank test. Cut￾off values for best discrimination were calculated using receiver￾operating-characteristics. A p-value,0.05 was considered signifi￾cant. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS (SPSS,
Version 20.0 for Windows; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL), SAS 9.1
software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and R (free shareware,
www.r-project.org).
Results
The study population bases upon 135 subjects (82 males) with
definitive IPF. The median age was 64 years (25th percentile: 56;
75th percentile: 72). Of those, 73 patients had PH [mPAP:
median, 34 (25th percentile: 27; 75th percentile: 43) mmHg; PWP:
median 8 (25th: 5; 75th: 12) mmHg; cardiac index: median 2.13
(25th: 1.83; 75th: 2.44) l/min/m2
)]. Patients with and without PH
did not differ concerning sex [men: 64.8 vs. 55.0%, p = 0.271],
height [171 (164; 178) vs. 170 (164; 175) cm, p = 0.299] and
weight [75 (65; 85) vs. 72 (63; 85) kg, p = 0.466], but in age [63 (52;
68) vs. 68 (58; 74) years, p = 0.026].
Lung function and CPET variables of both groups are given in
table 1. With the exception of KCO there were no differences in
PFT variables. Patients with PH had lower VO2@AT and peak
exercise and had significantly higher VE vs. VCO2 slope values.
Ventilatory constrains (VE, Vt, VTmax/IC and VE/MVV) did not
differ.
PH prediction
Potentials of prediction of interceding PH as well as statistical
significant cut offs are given in table 2. Highest AUC was seen for
VE vs. VCO2 slopepred, followed by peakVO2pred and KCOpred.
Applying %pred values showed statistical significant superiority to
absolute values (data not shown). AUC for KCOpred was 0.751
(cut off 57.4), for peakVO2 pred 0.832 (cut off 56.3), for
VO2@ATpred 0.743 (cut off 71.9) and for VE vs. VCO2 slopepred
0.938 (cut off 152.4). Combined endpoints consisting of each of the

significant variables did neither improve AUC nor sensitivities/
specificities (data not shown).
Prognosis in IPF
Survival analysis is shown in figure 1. During the follow up, 37
patients died and 6 underwent lung transplantation. For two
subjects, no follow up information were available, reducing the
study sample to 133 patients. Overall survival in the IPF
population was 87.5% at one year and 79.3% at two years. The
statistically most powerful prognosticator was the presence of PH
assessed by right heart catheterization [mPAP: hazard ratio 1.07
(1.04; 1.11); ChiSq 17.22; ProbChiSq ,0.0001].
In the overall IPF population KCOpred, peakVO2pred and
VO2@ATpred revealed significant prognostic properties (table 3) in
the univariate analysis. In the multivariate analysis, besides the
presence of PH only peakVO2pred was independently predictive
for survival. Again, applying %pred values showed statistically
significant superiority to absolute values (data not shown).
Subgroup analyses for subjects with PH again revealed the
prognostic properties of the presence of PH, but other significant
associations could not be shown.
Discussion
In terms of the hypothesis framing this study, patients with
interceding PH in IPF show significant differences in exercise
capacity, gas exchange as quantified by ventilatory efficiency for
carbon dioxide and diffusing capacity, independent of the severity
of restrictive lung disease. The presence of PH is best predicted by
VE vs. VCO2 slope and peakVO2 in our patients. Survival is
severely impaired in PH patients. Besides the presence of PH as
invasively assessed by mPAP, prognosis is best predicted by oxygen
uptake at peak exercise.
Advanced interstitial lung diseases impair exercise capacity and
increase dyspnoea during exercise [8,9,29,30]. In IPF, exercise

capacity is further diminished by coexisting PH, reflected in a
further impairment of peakVO2 during incremental exercise tests
as well as in 6 minute walk distance [6,8]. As demonstrated
previously, reduced exercise capacity is accompanied by increasing
ventilatory constrains to eliminate carbon dioxide as quantified by
ventilatory inefficiency, both independent of the severity of
restrictive lung disease due to IPF [8,9]. During incremental
exercise, exercise capacity depends on any organ system involved
in the coupling of respiration, gas exchange and cellular
metabolism. In patients with advanced IPF, one may expect that
the restriction in exercise capacity is due to ventilatory mechanics.
In the present study, lung volumes did not differ between PH and
non-PH subjects. Furthermore, measures during exercise to
quantify ventilatory mechanical constrains such as breathing
reserve and Vt/IC relationship turned out to be moderately
abnormal and did not separate between patients with and without
PH. Therefore, we assume that diminished lung mechanics
contribute to impaired exercise capacity and ventilatory ineffi￾ciency in the overall population of IPF patients. Our as well as
previously published findings imply that interceding PH in IPF
results in a further limitation due to circulatory impairment [8,9].
To the best of our knowledge this is the first study investigating
the potencies of PFT and CPET measures in their predictive
power to suspect PH in IPF. Diagnosing PH even in IPF implies
invasive assessment of mPAP, and in the majority of cases
suspicion of PH will base on transthoracic echocardiography
[14,31]. Since transthoracic echocardiography is complicated by
impaired sensitivity and specificity in IPF patients, we suggest PFT
and CPET measures as useful additional tools in the diagnostic
work up [12]. Boutou et al described VE/VCO2 ratio at AT as an
independent predictor of PH in 81 IPF patients [9]. However, this
study bases on echocardiography only and does not provide a
usable cut off for VE/VCO2 ratio. The present study shows that
PH is best predicted by VE vs. VCO2 slopepred, followed by
peakVO2pred, KCOpred and VO2@ATpred applying relative
(%predicted) rather than absolute values and adjusting for
potential interfering factors, such as age, sex, height and weight.
This theoretical rational is further verified by our analyses, since
relative values showed statistical superiority.
This study further contributes to our knowledge on how lung
function and exercise capacity will contribute to the prognostic
assessment in IPF. Longitudinal decline in FVC has been shown to
be a reliable prognosticator in IPF [7]. The data shown by du Bois
base on patients evaluated within interventional trials, and it
remains unclear whether these trials include substantial numbers
of patients with interacting PH [32,33]. Fell et al outlined
peakVO2 as prognostically important for patients with different
entities of interstitial lung disease [29]. Besides the heterogenic
population the proportion of PH patients was not investigated
[29]. In our study, patients with PH showed poor survival
compared to the overall IPF population. The major impact on
survival was due to the presence of PH as assessed by invasive
diagnostics. In addition, peakVO2pred showed prognostic proper￾ties. Focusing on the PH subgroup, no statistical significant
predictors were shown - potentially because of an underpowered
subgroup of PH patients. Further studies are needed to clarify
prognostication in this specific population.
The strength of the study is the multi-centre design with a
standardized study protocol for exercise testing and lung function.
In this setting, ‘‘real life’’ IPF patients of centres specialized in IPF
and PH have been investigated, the potential biases due to
interventional therapeutic trials or waiting lists for lung transplan￾tation have been avoided. All evaluations base on invasively
assessed PH. Of course, this study has limitations. First, the study
was not powered to investigate further subgroups of IPF patients
for prognostication since just 19 patients in the non-PH group
reached an endpoint. Second, the majority of patients were
investigated in specialized centres for PH and IPF resulting in
some recruitment bias. We are unable to quantify this bias. Finally,
the data set lacks measurements of arterial blood gases in a
substantial number of patients and consequently, these measures
could not be analysed. Unfortunately, the same is true for
6 minute walk distance.
Conclusion
In IPF, coexisting PH further impairs diffusing capacity,
exercise capacity and ventilatory efficiency. The clinical and
prognostic consequences of PH might not adequately be assessed
by resting PFT only. Exercise related measures in addition to PFT
will help to evaluate IPF patients, since PH in this patient
population has a major prognostic impact. Ventilatory efficiency
quantified by VE vs. VCO2 slopepred is the most reliable predictor
of PH. In the overall IPF population, besides the presence of the
PH survival is best predicted by peak oxygen uptake.
