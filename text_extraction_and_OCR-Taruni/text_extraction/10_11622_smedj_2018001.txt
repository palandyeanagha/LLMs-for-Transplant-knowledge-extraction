INTRODUCTION
Acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP) is an uncommon, but 
potentially fatal, disease occurring in the late stage of pregnancy or 
in the early puerperium with microvesicular fatty infiltration of the 
liver, which can induce maternal multiorgan failure or even death 
of the mother and fetus.(1) As early as 1934, AFLP was depicted 
by Stander and Cadden(2) as ‘acute yellow atrophy of the liver’. 
Existing evidence shows that the aetiology of AFLP may involve 
oxidative stress on the liver, increased levels of serum arachidonic 
acid and abnormalities in the intramitochondrial processes of fatty 
acid oxidation, such as long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A 
dehydrogenase deficiencies caused by G1528C mutation.(1,3) The 
estimated incidence of AFLP ranges from approximately one in 
7,000 deliveries to one in 20,000 pregnancies,(2-6) suggesting a 
low prevalence among pregnant women.
Although the incidence of AFLP is low, it remains a common 
cause of liver failure in pregnancy and may be accompanied 
by renal failure, coagulation disorders, hypoglycaemia, 
encephalopathy and, often, multiple organ dysfunction.(1,7) Both 
maternal and fetal mortality rates are significantly increased 
and vary between 1% and 20% despite optimal obstetric and 
medical management.(2,8) With acceptance of the importance 
of early recognition and diagnosis of AFLP as well as prompt 
delivery and intensive supportive care, maternal mortality 
has decreased from as high as 85%(9) to the current range of 
12.5%–18%.(10) Simultaneously, neonatal mortality rate has 
also decreased and is in the range of 7%–66%.(3,11) Previous 
clinical studies on AFLP, largely based on a few patients due 
to its low prevalence, have found large variations in results 
vis-à-vis its epidemiology,(2-6) symptoms,(12) complications(12)
and outcomes.(3,10,11,13) For instance, Cheng et al(14) found that, 
besides aetiology, other clinical characteristics of pregnancy 
(e.g. primiparity, male fetus and multiparous women) that had 
been identified as potential risk factors in some other studies(9,15)
seemed to be partially statistically insignificant in their patients. 
Cheng et al also indicated that twin pregnancies might be a 
protective factor for maternal outcome.(14) Conversely, Knight 
et al(6) concluded that twin pregnancies were at higher risk of 
AFLP, similar to Davidson et al,(16) who demonstrated that triplet 
gestation could increase risk for AFLP.
In view of the insufficient understanding of AFLP and 
inconsistencies in the related literature, further studies involving 
larger patient populations are necessary to better guide clinical 
decision-making, improve prognosis, allow risk stratification 
and design clinical trials. Our study aimed to analyse a large 
sample of 133 patients with AFLP in order to: (a) summarise their 
Outcomes and risk factors of patients with acute fatty 
liver of pregnancy: a multicentre retrospective study

INTRODUCTION Acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP) frequently causes liver failure in pregnant women. A better 
understanding of the clinical characteristics, management, outcomes and risk factors of AFLP is required, given its 
relatively high mortality rate. We aimed to describe the characteristics of AFLP, and further assess its outcomes and 
potential risk factors from the perspectives of the mother and fetus.
METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study of 133 patients with AFLP hospitalised at four tertiary hospitals in 
China between January 2009 and April 2014.
RESULTS Among 133 patients, AFLP was diagnosed in the postpartum period for 13 (9.8%) patients. Potential factors 
influencing adverse maternal outcome were male fetus (p = 0.04), postpartum diagnosis of AFLP (p < 0.01), intrauterine 
fetal death (p = 0.04), disseminated intravascular coagulation (p < 0.01), prothrombin time (p < 0.01) and activated 
partial thromboplastin time (p = 0.04). The frequency of fetal distress (p = 0.03) and activated partial thromboplastin 
time (p < 0.05) were significantly higher in pregnancies with dead fetuses than in those where the fetuses survived. 
Independent risk factors for perinatal maternal mortality were history of legal termination of pregnancy (odds ratio [OR] 
1.958, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.133–3.385), total bilirubin (OR 1.009, 95% CI 1.003–1.014) and serum creatinine 
(OR 1.010, 95% CI 1.003–1.017).
CONCLUSION Compared with total bilirubin and serum creatinine, history of legal termination of pregnancy appeared 
to be a greater risk factor for maternal mortality among patients with AFLP.

clinical characteristics; and (b) further appraise the outcomes and 
potential risk factors of maternal and fetal mortality.
METHODS
We retrospectively analysed a consecutive series of 133 patients 
with AFLP hospitalised between January 2009 and April 2014 
at the departments of critical care medicine or obstetrics at the 
following hospitals in China: Shandong Provincial Hospital 
Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan; The First Affiliated 
Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang; Beijing Chao-Yang 
Hospital, Beijing; and Liaocheng People’s Hospital, Liaocheng. 
Patients’ data was collected from their medical records. The 
study was approved by the ethics committees at these hospitals.
The diagnosis of AFLP was determined based on both clinical 
features and laboratory findings, including: (a) symptoms of 
jaundice, anorexia, fatigue, nausea, vomiting and abnormal liver 
function during the third trimester of pregnancy; (b) characteristic 
laboratory findings (e.g. elevated alanine transaminase, bilirubin and 
serum creatinine levels), leucocytosis, prolonged prothrombin time, 
reduced fibrinogen and hypoglycaemia; (c) ultrasonography images 
or computed tomography (CT) examination showing fatty liver; and 
(d) liver biopsy sample, with characteristic pathological changes, 
where available. All patients exhibited six or more of the Swansea 
criteria (Table I), which objectively confirmed the diagnosis of 
AFLP.(2) During the study period, patients with AFLP for whom liver 
dysfunction had other causes, such as viral hepatitis, hepatotoxicity, 
biliary tract disease and cholestasis of pregnancy, were excluded.
The diagnosis of acute liver failure based on clinical and 
laboratory criteria was made as follows: evidence of coagulopathy, 
international normalised ratio ≥ 1.5 or prothrombin activity 
≤ 40%; serum total bilirubin ≥ 171 µmol/L or a daily rise ≥ 17.1 
µmol/L; and any degree of mental alteration (encephalopathy) in 
a patient without pre-existing liver disease and illness < 2 weeks’ 
duration.(13) Acute renal failure (ARF) was defined as deterioration 
of renal function over days to weeks and serum creatinine ≥ 265.2 
µmol/L, and acute kidney injury was defined as a deterioration in 
renal function and serum creatinine > 150 µmol/L.(13)
All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS 
Statistics for Windows version 22.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, 
USA). Data was expressed as mean ± standard deviation, or 
frequency and percentages. Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test 
was used for analysis. Logistic regression analysis was performed 
to analyse relative factors. A p-value < 0.05 was considered to 
be statistically significant.
RESULTS
In total, 140 patients were clinically diagnosed with AFLP during 
the study period. Among them, five patients were excluded as they 
did not meet the Swansea criteria and two patients were excluded 
because of obstetric cholestasis. Eventually, 133 patients with 
AFLP were enrolled in the study, among whom 13 (9.8%) were 
diagnosed in the postpartum period. Abdominal ultrasonography 
was performed for all patients and 57.1% had positive results. 
Biopsy was not done for any patients in view of their serious 
condition and lack of consent.
The mean maternal age of the patients was 27.1 years and 
mean gestational age was 36.1 weeks (Table II). Prodromal 
symptoms lasted for a mean duration of 10.0 days before 
admission. The median duration from first symptom to 
delivery was five days. Detailed maternal manifestations and 
complications, and main abnormal prenatal laboratory findings 
are shown in Tables III and IV, respectively. Abnormal blood 
glucose levels were found in 89 (66.9%) patients, among whom 
hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia were seen in 76 (57.1%) 
patients and 13 (9.8%) patients, respectively. 24 (18.0%) patients 
were treated with plasma exchange, 32 (24.1%) patients needed 
renal replacement therapy and 43 (32.3%) patients required 
mechanical ventilation. However, no patient underwent liver 
transplantation. Major reasons for maternal death in our study 
were multiple organ system failure, disseminated intravascular 
coagulation and shock.
As shown in Table V, higher proportions of the women who 
died compared to those who recovered had a history of legal 
termination of pregnancy (TOP) (68.2% vs. 37.8%; p = 0.01),

male fetus (81.0% vs. 57.4%; p = 0.04), AFLP diagnosed in the 
postpartum period (31.8% vs. 5.4%; p < 0.01), intrauterine fetal 
death (18.2% vs. 4.5%; p = 0.04), disseminated intravascular 
coagulation (45.5% vs. 15.3%; p < 0.01), elevated serum 
creatinine (86.4% vs. 55.9%; p < 0.01), prolonged prothrombin 
time (95.5% vs. 64.0%; p < 0.01) and prolonged activated partial 
thromboplastin time (95.5% vs. 74.8%; p = 0.04). Similarly, 
when fetuses were compared in terms of death versus recovery, 
fetal distress (16.7% vs. 4.8%; p = 0.03) and prolonged activated 
partial thromboplastin time (91.7% vs. 76.8%; p < 0.05) were 
more common among fetuses that died. Thus, history of TOP, 
male fetus, postpartum diagnosis of AFLP and intrauterine fetal 
death might be risk factors for maternal mortality, even as fetal 
distress was a risk factor for fetal death.
Multivariate logistic regression analysis was carried out for 
these variables, including gestational age, days from first symptom 
to delivery, frequency of TOP, gravidity and laboratory findings 
(Table VI). History of TOP (OR 1.958, 95% CI 1.133–3.385), total 
bilirubin (OR 1.009, 95% CI 1.003–1.014) and serum creatinine 
(OR 1.010, 95% CI 1.003–1.017) were independent risk factors for 
maternal outcome.
DISCUSSION
Symptoms of AFLP, especially in the early stages of disease, are 
atypical and can be overlooked. There is disagreement in the 
published literature regarding the symptoms and clinically common 
manifestations of AFLP, which included malaise, anorexia, nausea, 
vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice, ascites, hypertension and 
abdominal distension.(4,12-14,17) We found that anorexia, nausea, 
vomiting and abdominal pain were the main prodromal symptoms, 
while progressive jaundice and ascites were common signs.
Although the gold standard for diagnosis of AFLP is liver 
biopsy, this was not done for any patient in our study due to the 
invasive nature of the procedure, the seriousness of the patients’ 
condition and lack of consent. Much like in our study, the 
diagnosis of AFLP has seldom been confirmed using liver biopsy 
in other reports.(6,11,13,14) Also, liver biopsy may not be necessary 
for the diagnosis of AFLP in most cases, especially for patients 
with typical clinical findings or severe coagulation disorders.(2,3)
Imaging evidence of fatty changes in the liver was commonly 
demonstrated by abdominal ultrasonography and CT. Knight 
et al found that classical features of ascites or bright liver were 
only seen in a quarter of patients who underwent abdominal 
ultrasonography.(6) All patients underwent ultrasonography in

our study and 57.1% of patients had positive results. Similar 
to Knight et al’s findings,(6) few patients were diagnosed by CT 
in our study. Although CT may be considered a better option 
than ultrasonography when AFLP is suspected in a patient, 
ultrasonography is used more frequently for pregnant women, 
as it is difficult for these patients to accept CT given the possible 
harmful effects of radiation on the fetus. Wei et al(18) reported that 
the rates of positive AFLP diagnosis by ultrasonography and CT 
were 79.7% and 85.3%, respectively. However, the difference 
between the two methods was not statistically significant. In our 
study, we did not attempt to identify women with suspected AFLP 
using magnetic resonance imaging because of the undefined role 
of this modality in the diagnosis of AFLP.(19) However, the latest 
research has shown that magnetic resonance imaging-based liver fat 
quantification may be an effective tool to obtain a secure diagnosis 
of AFLP without liver biopsy.(20)
Early diagnosis, immediate delivery and comprehensive 
supportive treatment are the mainstay for the management of AFLP. 
The occurrence of complications is often associated with poor 
outcomes. Similar to earlier studies,(17) the major complications 
of AFLP observed among our patients were coagulopathy and 
hypoproteinaemia. Acute liver failure and ARF are the most 
significant and life-threatening complications of AFLP.(13) Among 
133 patients, 74 (55.6%) patients experienced acute kidney injury, 
but only 13 (9.8%) patients developed ARF. Hence, the morbidity 
of ARF in our study was far less than in other reports.(12,17) Only 
32 (43.2%) out of 74 patients with acute kidney injury in our 
cohort received renal replacement therapy. It is possible that 
early intervention, by way of renal replacement therapy, may 
have checked the further worsening of acute kidney injury in our 
patients, possibly resulting in the lower incidence of ARF. Ganesan 
and Maynard found that the cause of ARF in patients with AFLP 
may be related to early suppression of the β-oxidation of fats.(21)
In our series, 44 (33.1%) patients developed acute liver failure 
and 24 (18.0%) patients were treated with plasma exchange. 
Liver transplantation was not reported in our patients, although 
it has been suggested by Pereira et al(22) for patients with hepatic 
encephalopathy, severe metabolic acidosis or worsening 
coagulopathy. The role of liver transplantation in patients with 
AFLP is very limited due to the huge potential for recovery after 
delivery. Xiong et al have suggested that acute liver failure and 
ARF in patients with AFLP are reversible.(13) Related pathological 
findings were also reported by Rolfes and Ishak.(23)
Some clinical characteristics of pregnancy, such as 
primiparity, male fetus, multiple pregnancies and experiencing 
preeclampsia, were previously identified as potential risk 
factors for AFLP.(6,16,18,24) In our study, we identified history of 
TOP, male fetus, postpartum diagnosis of AFLP and intrauterine 
fetal death as the potential risk factors for adverse maternal 
outcome. Postpartum diagnosis of AFLP, which entails delayed 
comprehensive management of the condition, may be caused 
by the absence of early clinical manifestations and/or positive

laboratory findings. While our data confirms the importance 
of early diagnosis of AFLP in pregnant woman, the diagnostic 
time appeared to have no effect on fetal outcome.
In our study, maternal and fetal mortality rates were 16.5% 
and 22.4%, respectively. This finding is similar to those reported 
previously(3,10) and highlights the vulnerability of patients with 
AFLP. There were 22 (16.5%) women with twin pregnancies in 
our study, which was similar to another study.(6) A retrospective 
study by Cheng et al(14) found significant differences between 
patients who survived and those who died with respect to twin 
pregnancies. The proportion of mothers with twin pregnancies in 
their study (28.1%) was much higher than in ours (16.5%) and 
another previous report (18.0%).(6) However, it is possible that their 
finding was incidental and, given the small size of their sample, 
cannot be generalised to all populations. Having twin pregnancies 
might be a potential protective factor for maternal outcome, but 
we did not find any statistical significance in our study.
The difference between fetal survival and death in this study 
was not statistically significant for women with multiparity, 
singleton pregnancies, male fetus, vaginal delivery, history 
of TOP and postpartum diagnosis of AFLP. However, the 
frequency of fetal distress was significantly higher among dead 
fetuses than those that survived, such that fetal distress might 
be a risk factor for fetal mortality (p = 0.03). Logistic regression 
analysis demonstrated that history of TOP, total bilirubin and 
serum creatinine were independent risk factors for maternal 
outcome. Importantly, the mortality rate among patients with a 
history of TOP was nearly 1.958 times that of patients without 
such history. Related research also shows that prothrombin 
time and international normalised ratio are risk factors for fatal 
complications in patients with AFLP, and perinatal mortality is 
associated with the level of fibrin degradation products.(25)
A key strength of our study was that data was sourced from 
tertiary hospitals and our sample was larger than that of previous 
reports. To the best of our knowledge, the potential risk factors 
we identified have not been previously described. Logistic 
regression analysis identified some independent risk factors of 
patient outcome, with a history of TOP being associated with 
worse and adverse maternal outcomes.
Nevertheless, our study was not without limitations. First, we did 
not evaluate the morbidity of AFLP, due to the deficiency of data on 
total pregnant women during the study period. Second, we could 
not explain why a history of TOP was associated with mortality 
for patients with AFLP. It is possible that this association between 
a history of TOP and poor maternal outcome in our cohort was a 
matter of chance and not causative. More extensive studies may be 
needed to establish or negate the existence of such a relationship. 
Third, given the retrospective nature of our study, we were unable to 
determine patient outcomes following discharge from the hospital.
To conclude, the main prodromal symptoms of AFLP were 
anorexia, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, while progressive 
jaundice and ascites were common signs among our patients. We 
found that male fetus, postpartum diagnosis of AFLP, intrauterine 
fetal death, disseminated intravascular coagulation, prolonged 
prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were 
potential risk factors for maternal outcome. Similarly, fetal distress 
and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time were risk 
factors for fetal mortality. History of TOP, total bilirubin and serum 
creatinine were independent risk factors for maternal mortality.
