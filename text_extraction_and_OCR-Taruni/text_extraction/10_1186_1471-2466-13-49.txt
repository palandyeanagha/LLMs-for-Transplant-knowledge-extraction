Abstract
Background: The six-minute walk test (6MWT) is a simple, low tech, safe and well established, self-paced
assessment tool to quantify functional exercise capacity in adults. The definition of normal 6MWT in children is
especially demanding since not only parameters like height, weight and ethnical background influence the
measurement, but may be as crucial as age and the developmental stage. The aim of this study is establishing
reference values for the 6MWT in healthy children and adolescents in Switzerland and to investigate the influence
of age, anthropometrics, heart rate, blood pressure and physical activity on the distance walked.
Methods: Children and adolescents between 5–17 years performed a 6MWT. Short questionnaire assessments
about their health state and physical activities. anthropometrics and vitals were measured before and after a
6-minute walk test and were previously defined as secondary outcomes.
Results: Age, height, weight and the heart rate after the 6MWT all predicted the distance walked according to
different regression models: age was the best single predictor and mostly influenced walk distance in younger age,
anthropometrics were more important in adolescents and females. Heart rate after the 6MWT was an important
distance predictor in addition to age and outreached anthropometrics in the majority of subgroups assessed.
Conclusions: The 6MWT in children and adolescents is feasible and practical. The 6MWT distance depends mainly
on age; however, heart rate after the 6MWT, height and weight significantly add information and should be taken
into account mainly in adolescents. Reference equations allow predicting 6-minute walk test distance and may help
to better assess and compare outcomes in young patients with cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and are
highly warranted for different populations.

Background
The six-minute walk test (6MWT) is a simple, low tech,
safe and well established self-paced assessment tool to
quantify functional exercise capacity in individual with
various cardiorespiratory diseases [1]. The 6MWT is
performed by instructing the participant to walk as fast
as possible (without running) on a flat surface in 6 mi￾nutes, the distance walked (6MWD) is recorded [1]. The
6MWD is a good predictor for morbidity and mortality
in various diseases in adult populations [2-6]. Normal
values available for the 6MWD are based on different
adult cohorts [7-9]. From these, patients’ 6MWD in %
predicted of normal values can be calculated by formu￾las. However, whether the expression of 6MWD in %
predicted provide better prognostic information is still
debated [9].
The definition of normal 6MWD in children is espe￾cially demanding since not only parameters like height,
weight and ethnical background influence the measure￾ment, but may be as crucial as age and the developmen￾tal stage [10]. Therefore a reliable comparison with
healthy children of similar age, ethnical background and

posture is important. Values for children living in differ￾ent countries may not directly applicable to each other
[5]. Until now, data on normal values of the 6MWD
performed according to ATS standards for healthy chil￾dren and adolescence of both sex living in Central
Europe are very rare and highly warranted in order to
have comparative data for children and adolescents with
disease. Previous studies assessing normal values for the
6MWD in children or adolescent mostly investigated re￾stricted age ranges, distinct ethnics, were limited by their
small number of participants or investigated modified
6MWD tests [10-12].
The aim of the present study was to provide reference
values of the 6MWD based on demographics for
children and adolescents, aged 5–17 years living in
Switzerland. Further aims were to study the differential
influence of age, sex, height and weight on the 6MWD
and the potential added values of arterial blood pressure
(BP), heart rate (HR) before and after the 6MWD and
questionnaire-assessed physical activity in everyday life.
We aimed to study the above-mentioned measures taken
as a whole, gender-specific and separately for children
and adolescents as we hypothesised that age, sex and an￾thropometrics would influence the distance walked.
Methods
Patients
This study was performed according to the Declaration
of Helsinki, ICH-GCP as well as all national legal and
regulatory requirements. The study was approved by the
local ethics committee (Ethics committee University of
Zurich). The authors of this manuscript comply with the
Principles of Ethical Publishing in the International Jour￾nal of Cardiology [13]. Written informed consent for all
participants was given by parents or legal guardian as
well as by subjects. Recruitment took place at Swiss
schools in rural and urban areas after contacting the
authorities by an information letter and through mouth￾to-mouth propaganda. All candidates asked to partici￾pate took part in this study. Questionnaire assessment
and 6MWT were performed by the same two study
nurses in all participants.
6 minute walk test
Questionnaire and 6MWT took place at the same day.
In brief, exact age and sex were noted. Body weight and
height were measured and the body mass index (BMI, in
kg/m2
) was calculated by dividing the weight (in kg) by
the square of the body height in meters (m). Thereafter,
the blood pressure (mmHg), heart rate (bpm) and the
peripheral arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2%) were
measured after a resting period in sitting position for at
least 5 minutes. Thereafter the 6MWT was performed
according to the guidelines of the American Thoracic
Society for adults [1]. Children and adolescents were
instructed according to a standardised protocol to per￾form the 6MWT by walking around two flagpoles posi￾tioned 30 m apart on a flat ground. Subjects were
instructed to walk as fast as possible (without running)
at a steady pace for 6 minutes. After 5 minutes time left
had been advised to the participant. No other comman￾dos or verbal feedback was given. Specially trained study
nurses who supervised the test measured the exact cov￾ered distance. Directly after the test, exercise BP, HR and
SpO2 were re-measured. The mean arterial pressure
(MAP) was calculated by adding twice the diastolic pres￾sure to the systolic pressure and dividing the sum by
three.
Questionnaire assessments
Health state of participants was assessed by a standar￾dised questionnaire asking the following information
from parents and adolescents, respectively: Is your child/
are you healthy? Is your child/are you able to participate
normally in physical activities? Is your child/are you tak￾ing regular medication? Does your child/do you suffer
from asthma or another chronic disease? Did your child/
did you have an operation of the lower extremities,
which make it difficult for you to walk? If with the aid of
this questionnaire disability was detected, the child was
excluded from the study. In addition, we asked for phys￾ical activities as follows: How many hours do your child/
do you participate in physical activities a week beside
the obligatory school sport? Answers were scored re￾ferred to physical activity score (PAS) on a scale between
0 and 4 with 0 standing for no additional physical

weekly physical activity.
Statistical methods and power calculation
Power calculation on the basis of the available data from
adults [7] revealed that with the assumption of a standard
deviation of 40 m per age group the inclusion of 20 girls
and boys each for each age year resulting in testing a total
of 440 children respectively adolescents would be suffi￾cient to provide reliable normal values of the 6MWD for
the age groups tested including an alpha error of 5%.
Characteristics of the participants are summarized by
means ± (standard deviation, SD). Patients were allocated
into yearly age groups and binary by an assumed onset of
puberty at 12 years in girls and 13 years in boys in children
and adolescents. Baseline variables for different groups
have been compared using Mann–Whitney-U-Test. Per￾centile curves were plotted using a specialized computer
program (LMSchartmaker pro, Version 2.43, http://
homepage.mac.com/tjcole). Pearson correlation, linear and
step-wise multiple linear regressions as provided by the
SPSS program were used to correlate characteristics with
the 6MWD and to provide prediction equations for the
6MWD. Durbin-Watson tests (DW) were used to correct
for autocorrelation in multiple linear regression models.
IBM, SPSS package Version 21 was used for statistical cal￾culation. A probability of P < 0.05 has to be considered
significant.

Results
General
A total of 496 children and adolescents (252 girls) were
included upon written informed consent. All participants
were healthy according to the predefined questionnaire.
Subjects’ characteristics are shown in Table 1. All chil￾dren completed the entire 6MWT according to the
protocol and thus none of them had to be excluded from
the study. In no case it was necessary to stop the test
prematurely, and there were no unexpected events dur￾ing the tests.
Gender-related characteristics in 6 minute walk distance,
body dimensions and vital signs
Overall, the mean distance walked within six minutes
was 618 ± 79 meters. Whereas weight and height steadily
increased with age, the 6MWD mainly increased until
puberty and then flattened (Figure 1a and b). 6MWD
distances, vital signs by gender-specific yearly age groups
are shown in Table 2 and Figure 2.
In females, the increase in 6MWD peaked just at the
time of assumed puberty (around age 12) and then
decreased back to a level already reached with about 9
years. In boys, the peak was similarly found around age
12, however, with exception of a temporary drop with 13,
they kept the peak 6MWD reached (Figure 2). Further
analysis revealed that taking a cut-off point a year earlier
or later would not have changed the main prediction.
We found a significant difference between boys and
girls in the 6MWD (626 ± 65 m versus 608 ± 55 m) and
the PAS (3 versus 2) (p < .001 and .017, respectively). We
found no other overall gender-specific differences. Sep￾arate analysis for children < 12 and ≥ 12 years revealed
significant difference in the 6MWD and PAS only for
adolescents (p = .000 for both). Analysis by yearly age
groups revealed significant gender-specific difference in
the 6MWD for 14, 15 and 16 year old and PAS￾Table 2 Age stratified characteristics and Six-minute walk test

difference for 9, 12, 13, 14 and 15 years old (lower
6MWD and PAS in females).
The MAP increased with age, whereas the heart rate
overall slightly decreased with increasing age groups
(Figure 3a and 3b).
The MAP slightly increased with exercise, on average
7 mmHg, without any significant gender or age differ￾ences. The mean heart rate at the end of the 6MWT
was 136 ± 23 bpm. The HR considerably increased by a
mean of 41 ± 22 bpm (43% change from resting heart
rate) without major differences between age groups. We
found a slightly higher exercise increase in HR in girls
compared with boys (43 vs. 40 bpm, p = .025). The SpO2
remained stable in both sex over all ages and after
exercise.
Correlations and equations to calculate normal 6MWD in
healthy children
Total group
We found a significant univariate correlation of age, height,
weight, BMI, resting and peak exercise blood pressures, ex￾ercise HR and PAS with the 6MWD (all p < .0001). Linear
regression revealed the following formula to calculate over￾all age-adjusted 6MWD: 6MWD = 11.89 × age (y) + 486.1
(p = .000, DW 2.045, see Table 3). Multiple, stepwise linear
regression in a model including age, weight and height re￾vealed that in this model age did no longer add informa￾tion to mere weight and height. Normal values for the
6MWD could therefore be calculated from height and
weight as follows (overall anthropometric formula):
6MWD = 391.9 × height (m) – 2.41 × weight (kg) + 140.2
(p = .000, DW 2.032). The same regression models were
then calculated separated by gender and sub-divided by an
assumed puberty of 12 years in girls and 13 years in boys
(Table 3).
Equations by gender
In girls, we found a significant univariate correlation of
age, height, weight, BMI, resting and exercise blood
pressure and HR with the 6MWD (all p = .000), but not
with PAS. Linear regression revealed significant age
dependency of the 6MWD for girls (p = .000, DW
2.187, Table 3). Addition of weight and height revealed
that age did no longer add information. Thus, a 7 year
old girl being 1.25 m tall and weighing 25 kg would
have a predicted walk distance of 575 m by the
gender-specific age-adjusted equation, 572 m by the
gender-specific anthropometric equation, and 569 m
by both, the age-adjusted and anthropometric overall
equation.
In boys, we found a significant univariate correlation of
age, height, weight, BMI, baseline and exercise BP, exercise
HR and the PAS with the 6MWD (all p < .000). The pre￾dicted 6MWD in boys could be calculated by age (p = .000,
DW 1.709, Table 3). Addition of weight and height revealed
that both significantly added to the equation (p = .001, .001
and .017, respectively, DW 1.724, Table 3).
Differential equations before versus after puberty in girls
and boys
In girls <12 years, linear regression revealed that age sig￾nificantly predicted the 6MWD (p = .000, DW 1.901,
Table 3). Multiple stepwise linear regressions by adding

weight and height reveal that only height did signifi￾cantly count below the age of 12 years in girls (p = .000,
DW 1.928). Thus, the predicted 6MWD for a 7-year-old
girl being 1.25 m tall would herewith be 566 m.
In female adolescents’ ≥12 years, age was still a signifi￾cant predictor of the 6MWD, however, the significance
is lower (p = .036, DW 1.901). Addition of height and
weight revealed that only weight remained significant
(p = .001, DW 1.870).
A 14-year-old girl being 1.65 m tall and weighting 56
kg would have a predicted walk distance of 630 m (to
compare: overall-equation of girls 634 m and height and
weight adjusted 639 m).
In boys < 13 years, age significantly predicted the
6MWD (p = .000, DW 1.539) and neither height nor
weight added to age to predict the 6MWD in pre￾teenage boys. In adolescent boys ≥ 13 years, age re￾mained the only significant predictor of the 6MWD,
weight and height did not add (p = .031, DW 1.789,
Table 3).
A 14-year-old boy has a predicted walk distance of
660 m (to compare: overall equation for boys 671 m).

Impact of vital signs and physical activity scores to
predicted 6MWD
Univariate correlation revealed that beside age, height
and weight, also exercise HR, MAP at rest and exercise
and PAS significantly correlated with the 6MWD. How￾ever, gender-separated analysis revealed that PAS corre￾lated with the 6MWD only in boys. Inclusion of vitals at
rest and exercise and the PAS in the stepwise regression
model in addition to age, weight and height revealed that
only exercise HR added information to age and an￾thropometrics in gender-specific analysis (Table 3).
If this extended model was analysed in gender-specific
before puberty, we found that in girls, the exercise HR
and height were significant predictors of the 6MWD,
whereas in boys, exercise HR, age, and weight were sig￾nificant predictors (Table 3).
In adolescents, this extended model revealed that in
girls the rest and exercise HR, weight, height and
PAS all significantly added to the prediction equation,
whereas in adolescent males only exercise HR and age
were significant predictors of the 6MWD.
Discussion
Our study shows that the 6MWD in healthy children
and adolescents is feasible. The 6MWD was clearly re￾lated to gender and age. On the basis of our study we
provide gender-specific, age-adjusted reference equations
and percentile curves (Figure 4a and 4b) for the 6MWT
in healthy children and adolescents living in Switzerland.
Multivariate stepwise models revealed that weight and
height may be taken into account; however, their value
added is mostly limited and depends on age-subgroup
analysed. Beside age and anthropometrics, the HR
achieved at peak exercise added to predict the 6MWD,
whereas questionnaire assessed physical activity only
weakly contributed in post-pubertal girls.
The 6MWT has become a standard in clinical practise
and research as a simple tool to assess exercise perform￾ance, function and response to treatment in adults with
cardiorespiratory disorders [1]. In analogy to the adult
population, the 6MWT has become increasingly import￾ant in children with cardiorespiratory disorders and it
has been shown to be reproducible, reliable and valid
[14]. In adults it is still controversial if the absolute
6MWD is best to assess performance and outcome or if
expressing the 6MWD in per cent predicted would be
better [9]. Reference equations for the 6MWD in adults
are available since over a decade [7]. However, they
failed to date to show a clear advantage over absolute
values. Current guidelines state that the 6MWD is
influenced by age, sex, weight, height and motivation,
but despite this, absolute thresholds around < 330–380
m are mostly mentioned to be predictors of a poorer
prognosis [1,15,16]. Despite this lack of proven clinical
validity to express the 6MWD in % predicted in adults,
it is obvious that in children and adolescents the influ￾ence of age and/or anthropometrics by far outreaches
their potential influence on 6MWD compared to adults.
Therefore, reference equations for the 6MWD in chil￾dren and adolescents are of importance for clinicians
and researchers treating and assessing children with car￾diorespiratory disorders. Li et al. performed 6MWT in
healthy children aged 7–16 years in Hong-Kong and
found a strong correlation with height [6]. However,
Asian children are known to have different anthropo￾metrics compared to Caucasian counterparts. In our
Swiss and purely Caucasian collective, we found some
influence of height, mainly in prepubertal girls, and
weight, mainly in adolescent women. However, age alone
was a significant predictor of the distance walked overall
and in different subgroups. Lammers et al. performed
6MWT in children aged 4–11 years in the UK and

found that in this collective with 83% Caucasians age
alone accounted for 41% of the variation in 6MWD, if
weight and height were added, 44% could be explained
[11]. In our collective, age alone was a significant pre￾dictor of the 6MWD overall, gender-specific overall and
separately addressed for prepubertal and post pubertal
children and adolescents. If height and weight were co￾analysed with age in a multivariate stepwise model we
found that age alone performed similarly well in gender￾specific and overall analysis (Table 3). Reference
equations including weight and height might be taken
into account for children with anthropometrics at the
margins of the normal distribution, e.g. extremely thin,
obese, small or large. Therefore we were able to plot
age-adjusted normal percentile curves for the 6MWD
for children and adolescents and can recommend their
use in everyday practice (Figure 4a and 4b). These
curves may help to visualize a sick child’s performance
in relation to healthy coevals and to observe the per￾formance over time, as it is known for many percentile

curves in paediatrics, such as weight and height. In
addition, we can provide simple age-adjusted, gender￾specific reference equations to assess the % predicted of
the 6MWD in girls and boys (Table 3).
In order get insight into the performance of children
compared to adolescents we did subgroup analysis by
separating girls at an age cut-off of 12 and boys with 13
years. We choose these cut-off points according to as￾sumed midpuberty at around this age. However, further
analysis revealed that taking a cut-off point a year earlier
or later would not have changed the main results. In fe￾males we found that height significantly predicted the
6MWD in prepubertal girls, whereas in adolescents,
weight had to be taken into account. We found that an￾thropometrics did not add to calculate reference values
of the 6MWD in boys and adolescent males.
A further interest of this study was to address the im￾pact of HR, BP, SpO2 and reported physical activity
assessed by a score on the 6MWD. According to normal
children’s development, resting BP slightly increased and
HR tended to decrease with age. The BP slightly in￾creased with exercise (mean increase 7 mmHg), the exer￾cise HR increased overall by a mean of 40%. As others
[11,17], we found a slightly higher exercise increase in

HR in girls compared with boys. Interestingly, we found
that the HR achieved at peak 6MWD (exercise HR) sig￾nificantly added to gender and age to calculate normal
6MWD, even if equations were calculated separately for
the subgroups before and after puberty. The degree of
HR increase during exercise most probably reflects a
higher effort (Figure 5a and 5b). These findings are novel
and indicate that the effort taken expressed by exercise
HR significantly influences the 6MWD.
In order to get information about physical activity and
fitness of the healthy children investigated, we asked
them or their legal representatives about participation in
sport and other physical activity and scored this with
numbers (from 0 to 4, no up to 4 additional weekly ac￾tivity hours). However, this PAS added significant infor￾mation to predict the 6MWD only in adolescent girls.
Potentially, the questionnaire to assess this PAS did not
really reflect physical activity in everyday life. It may well
be that some children were very active outdoors in gar￾dens and playground without achieving a high PAS as
they did not count outdoor playing to Sports activity.
The better performance of this score in adolescents may
point towards this direction.
Our work has the following limitations: In our study,
the 6MWD was measured only once in every child. So
we cannot provide information on the test – retest reli￾ability. We did not include an instrument to measure
specific motivation in our study. As we included several
children and adolescents of each age group, we believe
that the inter-individual differences in motivation would
somehow equilibrate around the average. Although we
tried to include consecutive children living in different
areas without any selection criteria, we cannot exclude a
selection bias with potentially more motivated subjects
being investigated by us. As we did only the 6MWD test
as described in the methods, we do not know the rela￾tionship of our test to other submaximal exercise test
such as cadence-based estimates or a method including
stride length [10,18]. A head-to-head comparison of dif￾ferent tests would be interesting, but also logistically de￾manding as performing more than one test would
potentially be biased by the time sequence. We did also
not simultaneously assess other parameters of physi￾ology, such as lung function tests. Peripheral oxygen sat￾uration was normal and remained normal during the
test in all healthy children as expected. Our normative
values and reference equations are only usable for the
age group we investigated. Thus, they will not apply for
very young children and toddlers, in which a 6MWD
test might as well be difficult to perform. Despite these
limitation, in our experience, the present form of the
6MWD is easy performable and utile as comparative
measures in the management and follow-up of children
and adolescents with cardiorespiratory diseases.
Conclusions
In summary, in this study we can provide sound refer￾ence equations and age-adjusted percentile curve to as￾sess the predicted 6MWD derived from a well-powered
and gender-adjusted Swiss cohort. We could show that
overall, age was the most important predictor, especially
for prepubertal children and boys, anthropometrics sig￾nificantly add mainly in girls. Exercise HR significantly
adds to predict the 6MWD and can be included to cal￾culate effort-adjusted walk distances.
