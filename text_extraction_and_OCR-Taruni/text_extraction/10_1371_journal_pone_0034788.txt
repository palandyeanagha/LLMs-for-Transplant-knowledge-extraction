Abstract
Rapamycin, an immunosuppressant agent used in renal transplantation with antitumoral properties, has been reported to
impair longitudinal growth in young individuals. As growth hormone (GH) can be used to treat growth retardation in
transplanted children, we aimed this study to find out the effect of GH therapy in a model of young rat with growth
retardation induced by rapamycin administration. Three groups of 4-week-old rats treated with vehicle (C), daily injections
of rapamycin alone (RAPA) or in combination with GH (RGH) at pharmacological doses for 1 week were compared. GH
treatment caused a 20% increase in both growth velocity and body length in RGH animals when compared with RAPA
group. GH treatment did not increase circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor I, a systemic mediator of GH actions.
Instead, GH promoted the maturation and hypertrophy of growth plate chondrocytes, an effect likely related to AKT and
ERK1/2 mediated inactivation of GSK3b, increase of glycogen deposits and stabilization of b-catenin. Interestingly, GH did
not interfere with the antiproliferative and antiangiogenic activities of rapamycin in the growth plate and did not cause
changes in chondrocyte autophagy markers. In summary, these findings indicate that GH administration improves
longitudinal growth in rapamycin-treated rats by specifically acting on the process of growth plate chondrocyte
hypertrophy but not by counteracting the effects of rapamycin on proliferation and angiogenesis.

Introduction
Rapamycin or sirolimus (Rapamune, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals,
Philadelphia, PA, USA) is used as immunosuppressant in
transplanted patients. Rapamycin directly inhibits mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR), a ubiquitous kinase that controls
different pathways related with cell proliferation, growth and
metabolism [1]. On the basis of its potent immunosuppressive,
antiproliferative and antitumor effects, rapamycin is able to treat
multiple conditions simultaneously [2]. Experimental and clinical
studies have showed that rapamycin is able not only to provide a
low rate of acute rejection and a significant improvement in kidney
allograft function, but also to significantly decrease the incidence
of posttransplant malignancies [3,4]. In addition, rapamycin has
the potential to interfere with fibrotic processes that often
accompany transplant rejection and to influence the preferential
development of immunological tolerance [2]. However, the use of
rapamycin is associated with many side effects, including increases
in serum cholesterol and triglycerides, anemia, proteinuria, skin
rashes, retard of wound healing and diarrhea, which can
eventually lead to rapamycin withdrawal [5].
In pediatric renal transplantation, rapamycin is mainly used as a
substitute for calcineurin inhibitors when nephrotoxicity or
proliferative diseases occur [6]. In this group of patients,
preservation and improvement of height potential, which can be
severely reduced due to multiple factors, is a major challenge [7].
Longitudinal growth is the result of new bone formation during
endochondral ossification, in which proliferation and differentia￾tion of epiphyseal growth plate chondrocytes directly correlate
with bone elongation. Recent studies from our group found that
rapamycin impairs longitudinal growth in young rats, causing
marked alterations in the growth plate [8], and that rapamycin
disrupts angiogenesis and decreases proliferation and hypertrophy
of growth cartilage chondrocytes [9]. In humans, Gonzalez et al
[10] reported lower growth rate in a small series of kidney
transplanted children treated with rapamycin in comparison with
a control group not treated with rapamycin. Therefore, there is
growing evidence that rapamycin can adversely affect longitudinal
growth this undesirable effect being of special relevance in
pediatric renal transplantation.
Over the past two decades, introduction of recombinant human
growth hormone (hereafter referred as GH) treatment has been
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 4 | e34788

used to improve growth retardation in children with chronic renal
disease, including transplanted patients [7]. It is unknown whether
the growth promoting effect of GH remains in the presence of
rapamycin and, on the contrary, the growth inhibiting effect of
rapamycin may be counterbalanced by GH treatment.
The study presented here was designed to find out the effect of
GH therapy on longitudinal growth in a model of young rat with
growth retardation induced by rapamycin administration.
Results
GH Effects on Growth and Nutrition
As shown in Table 1, animals treated with rapamycin and GH
(RGH) had a significantly greater increase in both nose to tail-tip
length gain and longitudinal bone growth rate when compared
with those treated with rapamycin (RAPA). Representative images
of tibial growth plate sections illustrating the differences in
longitudinal bone growth rate are shown in Figure 1A. GH
treatment was not associated to higher levels of circulating IGF-I
in RGH group when compared with RAPA (C: 288627 ng/ml;
RAPA: 524632 ng/ml; RGH: 516693 ng/ml). Trough rapamy￾cin levels were similar in both groups (RAPA: 19.464.0 ng/ml vs
RGH: 18.163.8 ng/ml).
GH Effects on Growth Plate Morphology
As shown in Figure 1B, RAPA animals exhibited marked
morphological alterations in the proliferative and hypertrophic
zones of the epiphyseal cartilage, including disorganization of the
proliferative layer with loss of the columnar pattern, hardly
noticeable transition zone from proliferative to hypertrophic
strata, and highly irregular chondro-osseus junction. These
alterations were also found in RGH growth plates. In addition,
Von Kossa staining revealed an abnormal pattern of mineraliza￾tion in both groups of rats evidenced by a wide area of
extracellular mineralized matrix as well as presence of both
transverse bands of mineralized matrix (red arrows) and numerous
chondrocytes totally surrounded by mineralized tissue (Figure 1C).
As resumed in Table 2, histomorphometrical analysis revealed
that the height of tibial growth cartilage was greater in RGH than
in RAPA animals. These differences were also found in the height
of the hypertrophic zone. However, the ration of hypertrophic
zone to cartilage height was not significantly different between the
three groups. Interestingly, the height of the terminal chondrocyte
was significantly higher in RGH animals when compared with
RAPA.
Finally, chondrocyte proliferation was assessed in growth
cartilage by immunodetection of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU).
BrdU-labelled chondrocytes were localized in the proliferative
zone in all groups (Figure 2A). Although there were a significant
decrease in the percentage of positive cells between rapamycin
treated groups and control animals, no statistical differences
between RAPA and RGH groups were found [C: 3561 positive
cells/100 cells; RAPA: 2863 positive cells/100 cells (p#0.05 vs C);
RGH: 3162 positive cells/100 cells (p#0.05 vs C)].
GH Effects on Growth Plate Angiogenesis
Picrosirius red/alcian blue staining showed morphological
anomalies in the primary spongiosa of both groups treated with
rapamycin (Figure 2B). In contrast with the typical arrangement of
longitudinal trabeculae seen in the primary spongiosa of C rats,
numerous transverse unresorbed septa were found in both groups
(yellow arrows), strongly depicting the pattern of the invading
capillary sprouts (red arrows).
Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) positive cells were
found in the primary spongiosa and along the vascular invasion
front in all groups (Figure 2C). In the area between the chondro￾osseous junction and 50 mm deep in the primary spongiosa, there
was a significant decrease in the number of TRAP-reactive cells
per mm2 between both groups treated with rapamycin and C
animals [C: 26266; RAPA: 139621 (p#0.05 vs C); RGH: 10366
(p#0.05 vs C)].
VEGF immunohistochemical signal was localized within the
cytoplasm of hypertrophic chondrocytes from the early hypertro￾phic zone to the distal end of the cartilage in all groups (Figure 2D).
This pattern of VEGF protein distribution was also observed at
mRNA level as disclosed by in situ hybridization experiments
(Figure 2E). In rapamycin treated animals, it is of note that several
chondrocytes adjacent to distal end of the growth cartilage did not
express VEGF, despite being metabolically active, as evidenced by
normal collagen X expression and alkaline phosphatase activity
(see Figure S1). Accordingly, the percentage of terminal VEGF
immunopositive cells showed a significant decrease in both
rapamycin treated groups when compared with controls [C:
9261 positive cells/100 terminal chondrocytes; RAPA: 6264
positive cells/100 terminal chondrocytes (p#0.05 vs C); RGH:
6863 positive cells/100 terminal chondrocytes (p#0.05 vs C)].
GH Effects on Chondrocyte Autophagy and Metabolism
Autophagy was studied in growth cartilage of rapamycin treated
rats using two different approaches. First, fluorescent immunode￾tection of total microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3)
revealed a strong signal mostly in the cytoplasm of early
hypertrophic chondrocytes in both groups (Figure 3A). This
signal, often detected as punctual staining (arrows in Figure 3B),
indicated induction of autophagy in these cells. Second, conversion
of LC3-I isoform to LC3-II, as indicative of autophagosome
formation, was assessed by western blotting. No differences in
LC3-II/LC3-I ratio were found between groups (Figure 3C),
suggesting that GH administration did not modify autophagy in
the epiphyseal chondrocytes.
Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain was used to identify glycogen
deposits, as an index of the energetic reserves of growth plate
chondrocytes. As shown in Figure 4A, PAS positive cytoplasmatic
granules were mostly seen in chondrocytes of the upper
hypertrophic zone, and positively marked cells were gradually
disappearing toward the distal end of the cartilage in all groups. In
C and RGH samples, PAS-positive granules were more abundant
and more intense stained than in RAPA animals suggesting
increased glycogen content.
Expression and phosphorylation of several proteins related to
glycogen biosynthesis and chondrocyte hypertrophy were studied.
IGF-I expression, assessed by immunohistochemistry and in situ
hybridization, was confined to the hypertrophic zone of growth
cartilage without differences between groups (data not shown). As

shown in Figure 4B, GH treatment strongly increased phosphor￾ylation of GSK3b (Ser9), a kinase that inhibits glycogen synthesis
and that is inactive upon phosphorylation. In addition, in RGH
animals GSK3b inactivation was associated with increased levels
of b-catenin (Figure 4C), one of the main GSK3b substrates that is
known to be degraded upon phosphorylation. Finally, marked
increases of p-AKT (Thr308) and p-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204)
were also found in RGH animals with regard to RAPA group
(Figure 4D).
Discussion
This study shows for the first time that GH administration
increases longitudinal growth in young individuals treated with
rapamycin at therapeutic doses. We [8,9] and others [11,12] have
previously reported that rapamycin impairs longitudinal growth in
young rats. In the present study, RAPA animals were markedly
growth retarded in comparison with control rats. GH treatment
caused a 20% increase in both growth velocity and nose to tail tip
length in RGH animals when compared with RAPA group. In a
recent case report, Rangel et al showed that GH therapy induced
catch up growth in a kidney transplanted child with growth failure
associated with sirolimus treatment [13]. Taken together, these
data suggest that GH administration has the potential to improve
longitudinal growth in transplanted children receiving rapamycin.
Prospective clinical trials are needed to confirm this assumption.
The present work also shows that GH acts locally in the growth
plate to promote linear growth in rapamycin treated animals. GH
is known to bind to specific receptors located in the epiphyseal
chondrocytes to increase longitudinal growth [14]. In our study,
GH treatment did not increase IGF-I circulating levels in RGH
animals when compared with RAPA, indicating that GH effects
on growth are exerted at local level in the growth plate rather than
mediated by an increase of systemic IGF-I. On the other hand, it is
unlikely that GH action was mediated by stimulus of the local
expression of IGF-I because in situ hybridization and immuno￾staining for IGF-I showed no differences between groups. As we
have previously shown [9], IGF-I levels were increased in
rapamycin treated animals when compared with control group
suggesting a resistance to systemic IGF-I. Since IGF-I levels have
been reported to control GH secretion through a negative
feedback loop [14], it could be argued that some of rapamycin
effects on growth may be the result of lower levels of circulating
GH. As GH is secreted in pulsatile form, further studies including
repeated serum samples and assessment of the GH profile and the
secretory bursts are required to confirm o reject this hypothesis.
An important finding of this study was that GH enhanced
chondrocyte hypertrophy in rapamycin treated animals, as
disclosed by a significant increase in the height of the terminal
chondrocyte. Similar effects on chondrocyte hypertrophy have
also been found in uremic young rats receiving GH [15]. Given
that chondrocyte enlargement supports nearly 60% of longitudinal
bone growth in young rats [16], and height of terminal
chondrocytes and longitudinal growth rate have been shown to
be positively correlated [17], it is likely that the increase in
longitudinal growth seen in RGH animals was mainly produced
by terminal chondrocyte enlargement. Although chondrocyte
hypertrophy is the major contributor to longitudinal growth [16],
numerous aspects of chondrocyte physiology contribute to bone
growth, and we cannot rule out that GH could target others than
those adversely affected by rapamycin. In fact, GH administration
rescued only partially longitudinal growth velocity of rapamycin
treated animals, indicating that some rapamycin adverse effects on
growth plate biology were still persistent. Indeed, GH adminis￾tration did not increase chondrocyte proliferation in the growth
cartilage and did not normalize the alterations in vascular invasion
described in RAPA animals, further supporting this notion.
Chondrocyte hypertrophy is a complex process regulated by
largely unknown molecular mechanisms. We have previously
shown that mTOR inhibition by rapamycin decreased chondro￾cyte hypertrophy in the growth plate [8,9]. Indeed, Akt/mTOR
pathway has been found to regulate chondrocyte autophagy [18],
a process thought to increase chondrocyte survival and maturation
within the epiphyseal cartilage [19]. As shown by immunofluo￾rescent detection of LC3, a major component of autophagosomes
and a marker of autophagy [20], we found that chondrocytes in
the early hypertrophic cartilage zones exhibited a distinctive
autophagic phenotype. This immunofluorescent labeling and the
western blot analysis of LC3-II/LC3-I ratio were not different
between both groups of animals, indicating that modulation of
autophagy is not involved in the effects of GH on growth plate.
A recent report has showed that hypertrophic differentiation of
growth plate chondrocytes during skeletal growth is promoted by
phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK-3b [21]. PIP3/Akt and
MAPK signalling pathways are both downstream of GH and IGF￾I receptors [22], and have been found to directly phosphorylate
and inactivate GSK3b [23]. In addition, inactivation of GSK3b
upon phosphorylation in Ser9 has been shown to increase
glycogen synthesis and to stabilize b-catenin in chondrocytes
[21]. b-catenin is a well known mediator of the canonical Wnt
signalling pathway, a major promoter of both chondrocyte
hypertrophy and final maturation [24]. In our study, we
demonstrated that GH administration increases GSK3b phos￾phorylation, cytoplasmatic glycogen deposits and b-catenin
protein levels in growth plate chondrocytes of rapamycin treated
rats. Moreover, we also reported a marked increase in Akt and
ERK 1/2 phosphorylation in GH treated animals when compared
with RAPA group. In the light of these findings, we propose that
GH would signal through PIP3/Akt and MAPK pathways to
phosphorylate and inactivate GSK3b in epiphyseal chondrocytes
(Figure 5). This would lead to an increase of glycogen synthesis
and stabilization of b-catenin, which eventually would enhance
chondrocyte hypertrophy. However, the role of GSK3 in cartilage
physiology is not completely understood. GSK3 protein family
consist of two different isoforms, GSK3a and GSK3 b with both
overlapping and distinct roles. A recent report by Gillespie et al.
showed that cartilage-specific inactivation of GSK3b in mice does
not affect bone growth [25]. Conversely, the authors report that
GSK3a expression levels were increased in these mice suggesting
the existence of a compensatory mechanism to counteract the loss

of GSK3b in cartilage. We cannot rule out the possibility that GH
administration is also inhibiting GSK3a activity in our study, thus
resulting in an overall inhibition of GSK3 signalling pathway. In
addition, it is of note that activation of the ERK1/2 pathway has
been shown to repress endochondral bone growth [26] which is
not consistent with the above hypothesis. Further experiments are
needed to clarify the role of the various intracellular pathways and
its functional interrelationship into the processes of cell growth and
maturation.
It is worth to mention that rapamycin antiproliferative and
antiangiogenic activities remained in the growth plate of RGH
animals. Despite being a well known mitotic agent, GH did not
increase cell proliferation in the growth cartilage of RGH animals.
In addition, alterations in vascular invasion seen in rapamycin
treated animals, such as abnormal arrangement of septa and blood
vessels in primary spongiosa, decreased VEGF expression in
terminal chondrocytes, and reduction of TRAP positive cells near
chondro-osseous junction, were also found in RGH group.
Antitumoral effects of rapamycin are thought to be related to
inhibition of cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Our study
importantly indicates that GH treatment can promote growth
without interfering with these effects, at least at the growth plate
level. Further studies are needed to clarify whether the potential of
GH to increase the risk of malignancy in kidney transplanted
children [27] persists in the presence of rapamycin treatment.
In summary, our study reports that GH administration
improves longitudinal growth in young rats treated with
rapamycin. This GH promoting effect is not related to antagonism
of the antiproliferative and antiangiogenic actions of rapamycin,
but to an increase in the growth cartilage chondrocyte hypertro￾phy which involves GSK3b inactivation and b-catenin stabiliza￾tion.
Materials and Methods
Animals
Female Sprague–Dawley rats aged 4 weeks and weighing
7065 g were housed in individual cages under controlled
conditions of light (12 h light/dark cycle) and temperature (21–
23uC). All animals received standard rat chow (A03; Panlab,
Barcelona, Spain) and tap water. Control animals were fed ad
libitum and RAPA and RGH were pair fed with C group. The study
complied with the Directive 86/609/EEC on the protection of
Animals used for Experimental and other scientific purposes in the
European Union. The protocol was approved by the Ethics
Committee on Animal Research of the University of Oviedo,
Spain.
Experimental Protocol and Sample Collection
After 3 days of adaptation to the experimental area, 1 mg/kg/
day of rapamycin diluted in 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO,
Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) was administered intraperitoneally at
10.00 am for seven days to 20 animals whereas control (C, n = 10)
rats were injected with 5% DMSO. On day 0 of the protocol,
rapamycin treated animals were classified into two groups of 10
individuals each: RAPA and RGH. From day 0 to 6 of the
protocol, in addition to rapamycin injection, RGH animals
received also 10 IU/kg/day of intraperitoneal recombinant
human GH (Norditropin, Novo Nordisk Pharma, Madrid, Spain)
at 09.00 and 17.00 h, whereas C and RAPA received vehicle.
Animals were killed under anesthesia on day 7 of the protocol.
Three days before sacrifice, each animal received 20 mg/kg of
calcein (Sigma) by intraperitoneal route for calculation of osseous
front advance as an index of longitudinal bone growth rate [9].
BrdU (100 mg/kg; Sigma) was also injected intraperitoneally at 1,
9, and 17 h before animals’ death. Blood samples were collected

and stored at 220uC until the measurement of rapamycin and
circulating IGF-I concentrations. Proximal ends of right tibiae
were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for protein expression
studies. Proximal ends of left tibiae were embedded in methyl
metacrilate as previously described [15]. Samples from half the
animals were fixed in 40% ethanol and used for analysis of calcein
and BrdU staining. The remaining samples were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde and used for histomorphometry, immunohis￾tochemistry, immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization studies.
Blood Measurements
Concentrations of rapamycin were measured in whole-blood
samples using an Abbott Imx analyzer (Abbott Cientifica, Madrid,
Spain) as previously described [8,9]. IGF-I serum concentrations
were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a
commercial kit and following manufacturer’s instructions (Immu￾nodiagnostic Systems, Boldon, UK). Inter- and intra-assay
variation coefficients were below 7%.
Growth
Nose to tail-tip length was measured under anesthesia on days 0
and 7. Longitudinal growth rate was measured in 10 mm-thick
frontal sections of the proximal end of tibiae as described
elsewhere [8].
Growth Plate Histology and Histomorphometry
Frontal sections (5 mm thick) of proximal tibiae fixed in
formalin were stained by the following methods: alcian blue/
safranine (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) for morphometric
analysis, alkaline phosphatase stain (Roche, Basel, Switzerland)
for chondrocyte maturation, TRAP stain (Sigma) for osteoclast
identification, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) reaction to stain glycogen
deposits (Merck), and picrosirius red/alcian blue/hematoxylin
(Merck) for analysis of bone and cartilage extracellular matrix.
Heights of the growth cartilage and its hypertrophic zone were
identified following morphological criteria and measured at
regular intervals using an image analysis system previously
described [8]. Height of the hypertrophic chondrocytes placed in
three most distal rows, those adjacent to the metaphyseal bone,
was measured in alternate columns using the same system.
Approximately, twenty five measurements were made per section
for a total of fifty measurements per animal. The number of TRAP
positive cells at the vascular invasion front was measured in an
area extending 50 mm from the distal end of the growth cartilage
into the primary spongiosa. Two slides per animal were used and
results were expressed as the number of positive cells per mm2
.
Growth Plate Immunohistochemistry and in situ
Hybridization
Immunodetection of BrdU, VEGF, IGF-I and collagen X were
carried out as described elsewhere [9]. For the immunohisto￾chemical detection of LC3, after overnight incubation with
primary antibody (dilution 1:10, MBL International, Woburn,
MA, USA), sections were treated with Alexa Fluor 488–labeled
secondary antibody (dilution 1:500, Fisher-Invitrogen, Barcelona,
Spain), counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vecta￾shield, Vector Laboratories Inc., Peterborough, UK), and
examined by confocal microscopy. Two sections per animal were

Figure 5. Proposed mechanism of the stimulating effect of GH on the hypertrophy of growth cartilage chondrocytes. GH would signal
through PIP3/Akt and MAPK pathways to phosphorylate and inactivate GSK3b in growth plate chondrocytes. This would lead to an increase of
glycogen synthesis and stabilization of b-catenin that, eventually, would enhance chondrocyte hypertrophy.

analyzed. The proliferating activity was expressed as the number
of positive cells per 100 cells in the proliferative zone, previously
defined as the band of tissue between the resting zone and a line
traced by the most distal BrdU-labeled cells. VEGF immunohis￾tochemical signal was measured in the three most distal rows of
chondrocytes and expressed as number of positive cells per 100
terminal chondrocytes.
In situ hybridization was used to define the mRNA distribution
pattern of VEGF and IGF-I in the growth cartilage following a
methodology previously described [9].
Western Blot
A total of 30 mg of protein, extracted from tibial frozen samples
as previously described [9], were resolved in SDS-PAGE and
transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P;
Millipore Iberica, Madrid, Spain). After blocking the membranes
in 5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk in TBST (Tris-buffered saline, pH
7.4, containing 0.05% Tween 20) at room temperature for 1 h,
blots were incubated with primary antibody specific to LC3
(MBL), p-AKT (ser473), AKT, p-ERK 1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204),
ERK 1/2, p-GSK3b (ser9), GSK3b, and b-catenin (Cell
Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA) diluted 1:1000 in TBST at 4uC
overnight. Immunoblots were then incubated at room temperature
for 1 h with the corresponding secondary antibody (Sigma).
Peroxidase activity was visualized using a chemiluminescent HRP
substrate commercial kit (Immobilon Western; Millipore Iberica)
following manufacturer’s instructions.
Statistical Analysis
Data are given as mean 6 SEM. Differences between groups
were assessed by ANOVA. Comparisons between two groups were
performed by Student t test. A P value #0.05 was considered
significant. All data sets were analyzed using SPSS 15.0 software
package (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).
