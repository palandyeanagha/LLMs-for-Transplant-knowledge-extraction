Abstract. Fabry disease is a lysosomal storage disorder 
(LSD) caused by deficiency of α-galactosidase A (α-gal A), 
resulting in deposition of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3; also 
known as ceramide trihexoside) in the vascular endothelium 
of many organs. A gradual accumulation of Gb3 leads 
to cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and renal dysfunction. 
Endothelial cell dysfunction leads to renal complications, 
one of the main symptoms of Fabry disease. However, the 
pathological mechanisms by which endothelial dysfunction 
occurs in Fabry disease are poorly characterized. The purpose 
of this study was to investigate whether the expression 
of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is associated with the renal 
pathogenesis of Fabry disease. We found that the protein 
expression levels of renal thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), TGF-β1 
and VEGF were higher in the kidneys from Fabry mice 
compared to wild-type mice. The expression levels of VEGF 
receptor 2 (VEGFR2), fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) 
and phospho-p38 (P-p38) were also higher in the kidneys 
from Fabry mice compared with wild-type mice. Activities 
of cysteine aspartic acid protease (caspase)-6 and caspase-9 
were higher in kidneys from Fabry than from the wild-type 
mice. These results suggest that overexpression of TGF-β1 
and VEGF in the Fabry mouse kidney might contribute 
to Fabry disease nephropathy by inducing apoptosis. To 
test whether Gb3 accumulation can induce apoptosis, we 
incubated bovine aortic endothelial cells with Gb3 and found 
increased expression of TGF-β1, VEGFR2, VEGF, FGF-2 and 
P-p38. The combination of increased expression of TGF-β1 
and VEGF caused by Gb3 accumulation may allow upregula￾tion of FGF-2, VEGFR2 and P-p38 expression, and these 
changes may be associated with Fabry disease nephropathy by 
inducing apoptosis.
Introduction
Fabry disease (OMIM 301500), also known as Anderson￾Fabry disease, is a rare X-linked inherited lysosomal storage 
disorder (LSD) caused by deficiency of α-galactosidase A 
(α-gal A; EC 3.2.1.22) (1,2). A lack of lysosomal α-gal A 
enzyme causes accumulation of glycosphingolipids, mainly 
globotriaosylceramide (also known as Gb3, GL-3, or ceramide 
trihexoside) within the vascular endothelium in the brain, 
heart, liver, spleen, eyes, skin and kidney, leading to cere￾brovascular, cardiac and renal complications (3). Renal 
insufficiency is observed in the final stage of life in a Fabry 
patient. However, structural changes in the kidney, including 
glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis, are observed even 
in young Fabry patients (4).
The Fabry mouse model has been established by disrup￾tion of the α-gal A-encoding gene (5). This knockout mouse 
model appears to be clinically normal, but ultrastructural 
analysis shows lipid inclusions in the liver and kidney. These 
pathophysiological changes in the α-gal A-knockout mouse 
are similar to those in patients with Fabry disease. An in vitro
vascular cell model has been generated by culturing aortic 
endothelial cells from α-gal A-null mice (6). In the vascular 
endothelium of α-gal A-null mice, the deposition of Gb3 
increases with age. Excessive Gb3 deposition in vascular 
endothelial cells is related to increased thrombosis and 
atherogenesis (7,8). The pathological mechanisms by which 
endothelial dysfunction occurs are poorly characterized. 
However, the pathogenic context of other kidney diseases 
including diabetes can provide clues for understanding the 
nephropathy of Fabry disease (9). Intracellular signaling 
proteins and growth factors such as insulin-like growth 
factors, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) play a role in the develop￾ment of diabetic nephropathy. These growth factors might 
also be related to the renal complication in patients with 
Fabry disease (9). TGF-β1 is known to play a key role in 
many diseases such as diabetes and renal disease (10,11). The 
TGF-β1 signaling pathway is mediated by mitogen-activated 
protein kinases (MAPKs), and TGF-β1 induces apoptosis in 
endothelial cells (12). VEGF is important in angiogenesis. 
VEGF binds to the VEGF receptors, fms-like tyrosine kinase 
[Flt-1, VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1)] and fetal liver kinase 1 
(Flk-1, KDR, VEGFR2). VEGF expression is regulated 
by hypoxia, cytokines and growth factors (13). VEGF is

expressed in glomerular podocytes and tubular epithelial 
cells.
Some investigators have proposed that the expression 
of TGF-β1 or VEGF is associated with Fabry nephropathy. 
Proteomic studies have demonstrated that circulating levels 
of VEGF and VEGFR2 are higher in young Fabry patients 
compared with controls (14,15). These observations suggest 
that TGF-β1 and VEGF expression is associated with Fabry 
nephropathy. We explored the roles of TGF-β1 and VEGF in 
the relationship between increased levels of Gb3 and endo￾thelial dysfunction in renal pathogenesis in a mouse model of 
Fabry disease.
Materials and methods
Animals. Fabry mice were kindly provided by Dr Roscoe O. 
Brady (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) 
and bred to produce sufficient numbers of mice for this study. 
To genotype each mouse, PCR was performed as described 
previously (5). Male mice were grouped into wild-type and 
hemizygous (Fabry) mice. Each group included a minimum 
of three animals. Sixteen-week-old mice were used for all 
experiments. All mice were provided with autoclaved water 
and diet ad libitum. All mice were treated in accordance 
with the Animal Care Guidelines of the School of Medicine, 
Ewha Womans University (Seoul, Korea). Fabry mice were 
treated with an injection of 1 mg Fabrazyme/kg (Genzyme, 
Cambridge, MA, USA) in saline through the tail vein.
Cell culture. For in vitro study, bovine aortic endothelial 
cells (BAECs) were cultured in minimum essential medium 
(MEM) supplemented with 5% neonatal calf serum, 2 mM 
l-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin (100 U/ml) at 37˚C 
in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. BAECs were used up to 
passages 7-9. All reagents were purchased from Gibco-BRL 
(Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Western blot analysis. Proteins obtained from 50 mg of renal 
tissue were homogenized using Pro-Prep buffer (iNtRON 
Biotechnology, Inc., Seongnam-si, Korea) supplemented 
with phosphatase inhibitor cocktail solution (Dawinbio, Inc., 
Hanam-si, Korea). Tissue samples were incubated on ice for 
30 min. Gb3-treated BAECs (80% confluent) were washed 
with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in PRO-PREP buffer 
supplemented with phosphatase inhibitor cocktail solution for 
30 min on ice. Insoluble material was removed by centrifuga￾tion at 12,000 x g for 10 min at 4˚C. Proteins (30-80 µg) 
were separated on a 7.5-13.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and 
electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride 
or nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). 
The membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris￾buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) for 2 h 
at room temperature. The blots were then incubated with 
primary antibody overnight at 4˚C. Antibodies used for 
western blot analysis were anti-thrombospondin (TSP)-1 
monoclonal (NeoMarker, Oviedo, FL, USA); anti-cleaved 
cysteine aspatric acid protease (caspase)-6 polyclonal; 
anti-cleaved caspase-9 polyclonal; anti-cleaved caspase-12, 
phospho-p38 (P-p38) polyclonal; anti-VEGFR2 polyclonal 
(Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA); anti￾fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) polyclonal (Abfrontier, 
Seoul, Korea); anti-TGF-β1 monoclonal (R&D Systems, 
Minneapolis, MN, USA); and anti-VEGF monoclonal (Santa 
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA) antibodies. 
The blots were washed with TBST three times for 5 min 
and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled 
secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Goat anti￾mouse IgG (1:2,500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and goat 
anti-rabbit IgG (1:2,500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were 
used as the secondary antibodies. After additional washes, the 
blots were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using 
an ECL detection kit (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) 
according to the manufacturer's instructions. The protein 
signals were visualized by exposing the membranes in a 
luminescent image analyzer (LAS-3000; Fujifilm, Tokyo, 
Japan). Each protein expression level was normalized to the 
expression of β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). 
The results were quantified using Multi Gauge V3.0 software.
Caspase-3/7 assay. Fifty micrograms of protein from kidney 
lysates (100 µl) and caspase-3/7 substrate-containing solution 
(100 µl) were mixed and incubated for 30 min to 1 h at 30˚C 
in 96-well tissue culture test plates (SPL Life Sciences, 
Pocheon-si, Korea). The activity was measured on a Veritas 
Microplate Luminometer instrument (Promega Corporation, 
Madison, WI, USA). Caspase-3/7 substrate was purchased 
from Promega Corporation.
Gb3 treatment. BAECs were seeded in 60 mm tissue culture 
plates (SPL Life Sciences) and were either untreated or treated 
with Gb3 (Matreya, Pleasant Gap, PA, USA) in complete 
MEM culture medium. The final Gb3 [dissolved in 100% 
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich)] concentration of 
the treatment was 15 µM.
Data analysis and statistics. The values are presented as the 
mean ± SD or ± SE. Statistical comparisons between groups 
were performed using the Student's t-test. P<0.05 was consid￾ered to indicate a statistically significant result.
Results
Protein expression of TSP-1, VEGF and TGF-β1 in kidneys 
of Fabry mice. The expression patterns of TSP-1, VEGF and 
TGF-β1 proteins were examined in the kidneys from Fabry 
and wild-type mice. As expected, TSP-1 protein expression 
was 234% higher in Fabry than in wild-type mice (Fig. 1) 
(P<0.05). VEGF protein expression was 214% higher in 
Fabry mice (P<0.05). TGF-β1 protein expression was 422% 
higher in Fabry than in wild-type mice (P<0.01). These results 
suggest that VEGF expression is influenced through another 
pathway associated with TGF-β1.
Protein expression of VEGFR2, FGF-2 and P-p38 in kidneys 
of Fabry mice. Western blot analysis was performed to test 
the hypothesis that the combined overexpression of TGF-β1 
and VEGF is associated with Fabry disease nephropathy. The 
protein expression of VEGFR2 was 157% higher in kidneys 
from Fabry than that in wild-type mice. FGF-2 expression 
was 365% higher in Fabry mice and P-p38 was 631% higher 

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MEDICINE 30: 1275-1280, 2012 1277
in Fabry than these levels in wild-type mice (Fig. 2). These 
results suggest that apoptosis signaling may be induced by the 
increased expression of TGF-β1 and VEGF in the kidney in 
the Fabry disease mouse model.
Activation of caspases in the Fabry mouse kidney. The degree 
of activation of caspase-6, -9 and -12 was determined by 
measuring the levels of the cleaved forms of these caspases. 
The results shown in Fig. 3 indicate that the levels of cleaved 
caspase-6 (148%, P<0.05) and cleaved caspase-9 (157%, 
P<0.05) were significantly higher in Fabry mice than in wild￾type mice. Cleaved caspase-12 level increased nonsignificantly 
(163%, P=0.06). To confirm that apoptosis was induced in the 
kidneys of Fabry mice, caspase-3/7 activity of key apoptotic 
proteins was measured using a colorimetric assay. The results 
shown in Fig. 4 indicate that caspase-3/7 activity was 128% 
higher in the kidney lysates from Fabry mice than in those 
from wild-type mice. In enzyme replacement therapy (ERT)-
treated Fabry mice, activity of caspase-3/7 was 68% lower 
than that in the untreated Fabry mice (P<0.01).
Effect of in vitro Gb3 treatment on BAECs from Fabry 
mice. To investigate whether Gb3 accumulation induces the 
expression of TGF-β1 and VEGF in vitro in BAECs in a 
manner similar to that observed in Fabry mice, BAECs were 
treated either with control (vehicle, DMSO alone) or 15 µM 
Gb3 for 2 or 8 h (Fig. 5). The protein expression levels of 
TGF-β1, VEGFR2, VEGF, FGF-2 and P-p38 were higher in 
Gb3-treated BAECs than in control BAECs. Expression of

compared with 2 h.
Discussion
Endothelial dysfunction related to excess Gb3 leads to renal 
complications in Fabry disease (3); however, the pathological 
mechanism responsible for the endothelial dysfunction caused 
by Gb3 accumulation is poorly understood. We hypothesized 
that growth factors such as TGF-β1 and VEGF, which play a 
role in the development of diabetic nephropathy, are upregu￾lated in Gb3-accumulated endothelial cells and the Fabry 
mouse kidney, and that these factors play a crucial role in the 
development of the renal complications of Fabry disease (9).
Previously, we observed upregulation of lipocalin 2 
(LCN2) and TSP-1 in the Fabry disease mouse and suggested 
that these molecules are candidate biomarker molecules for 
Fabry disease (16). To investigate further whether LCN2 
induces TSP-1 expression and inhibits VEGF expression as 
reported previously (17), we examined the expression patterns 
of TSP-1 and VEGF in kidneys from Fabry and wild-type 
mice. We found higher TSP-1, VEGF and TGF-β1 expression 
levels in the kidneys from Fabry mice when compared with 
these levels in the wild-type mice (Fig. 1). These findings 
suggest that increased VEGF expression is associated with 
increased TGF-β1 expression.
TSP-1 is an extracellular matrix-remodeling glycoprotein 
and a crucial component of tissue remodeling and is associated 
with inhibition of angiogenesis (18). TSP-1 binds to multiple 
integrins and their receptors. The regulatory effects of TSP-1 
are mediated by the interactions between TSP-1 and receptors 
(19). Zhang et al (20) reported that hepatocyte growth factor/
scatter factor induces angiogenesis via TSP-1 downregula￾tion and VEGF upregulation. In tumor cells, ectopic TSP-1 
expression directly inhibits endothelial cell proliferation and 
survival, which promotes endothelial cell apoptosis. Thus, 
TSP-1 and VEGF can act as angiogenic regulators. In endo￾thelial cells, TSP-1 induces apoptosis through activation of the 
Src-family tyrosine kinase (p59 Fyn), caspase-3-like proteases 
and p38. Subsequent activation of activator complex-1 (AP-1) 
leads to apoptosis (21,22). TSP-1 expression is increased in 
progressive renal disease and is associated with renal fibrosis 
(23) and TSP-1 stimulates TGF-β1 in diabetes (24). TSP-1 is a 
possible activator of TGF-β1 in kidney injury and can induce 
apoptosis of endothelial cells in many normal tissues (25,26). 
Consistent with previous reports, our data also showed that 
TSP-1 and TGF-β1 expression levels were higher in Fabry 
mice than in wild-type mice (Fig. 1).
VEGF increases vascular permeability, prevents apoptosis 
in endothelial cells (27,28) and induces apoptosis in cerebral 
endothelial cells after cell injury (29). Ferrari et al (30) 
suggested that TGF-β1 activates FGF-2 expression in endo￾thelial cells, which then promotes VEGF production. They 
reported that TGF-β1 induces apoptosis via VEGF/VEGFR2-
mediated phosphorylation of MAPK p38. Cross-talk between 
TGF-β1 and VEGF expression can alter the response of 
endothelial cells to apoptotic signals. Our results, shown in 
Figs. 1, 2 and 5, are consistent with these observations. Other 
investigators have also supported the hypothesis that TGF-β1 
induces VEGF expression through MAPK (ERK1/2 and p38) 
activation (31) and that FGF-2 modulates VEGF expression in 
endothelial cells (32). Li et al (33) also suggested that VEGF￾induced FGF-2 expression in injured endothelial cells leads 
to migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells. VEGF 
stimulation results in TGF-β1-induced fibrosis in proximal 
tubular (NRK52E) cells (34). TGF-β1-induced epithelial cell

apoptosis is associated with p38 (35). As discussed above, 
VEGF expression may not be downregulated by LCN2, but 
may be upregulated by TGF-β1.
We found that TGF-β1 and VEGF expression is increased 
in the Fabry mouse kidney and in Gb3-treated BAECs 
(Figs. 1 and 5), suggesting that TGF-β1 and VEGF upregula￾tion may be associated with dysfunction of endothelial cells. 
Similarly, Sanchez-Nino et al (9) reported that the expression 
of TGF-β1, CD74 and extracellular matrix protein were 
increased by adding lyso-Gb3 (deacylated Gb3 form) to human 
podocytes, showing that TGF-β1 and CD74 are mediators 
of podocyte injury. CD74, the macrophage inhibitory factor 
receptor, is a potent receptor of kidney injury in diabetic 
nephropathy. Increased expression of TGF-β1 and/or VEGF in 
podocytes is associated with apoptosis or nephropathy (36,37). 
Our results are consistent with those from a rat nephropathy 
model in which TGF-β1 and VEGF expression increases (38). 
Therefore, we hypothesized that the combined overexpression 
of TGF-β1 and VEGF may be associated with Fabry disease 
nephropathy through induction of apoptosis.
We found significantly increased activities of caspase-6 
and -9 in the Fabry mouse kidney and nonsignificant 
increases in the relative caspase-3/7 and -12 activities 
(Figs. 3 and 4). Caspase-9 and -12 are initiator caspases and 
caspase-3, -6, and -7 are effector caspases. In the final stage 
of the apoptosis pathway, effector caspases are activated by 
cleavage of cellular substrates (39). We found that apoptosis 
was induced in kidneys from Fabry mice when compared 
with wild-type mice. This apoptosis pathway might be 
related to the intrinsic pathway rather than to endoplasmic 
reticulum stress. Activity of caspase-3/7 in the kidney did not 
differ significantly between Fabry and wild-type mice but 
was lower in ERT-treated Fabry mice compared with Fabry 
mice. De Francesco et al (40) suggested that peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMC) from Fabry disease's patients were 
in an apoptotic state, which correlated with the accumulation 
of Gb3. This suggests that Fabry nephropathy is associated at 
least partly with the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.
To investigate whether Gb3 treatment induces expression 
of TGF-β1 and VEGF in the endothelial cells, BAECs were 
treated either with control (DMSO alone) or with 15 µM 
Gb3 for 2 or 8 h (Fig. 5). As expected, protein expression of 
TGF-β1 and VEGF increased in Gb3-treated BAECs. The 
combined expression of increased TGF-β1 and VEGF by Gb3 
treatment may allow the upregulation of FGF-2, VEGFR2 
and P-p38 expression (30). This finding is consistent with the 
increased protein expression observed in kidneys from Fabry 
mice.
Since apoptotic changes in renal biopsies from Fabry 
patients have not been demonstrated, apoptosis caused by the 
combined overexpression of TGF-β1 and VEGF cannot be the 
main pathogenic mechanism underlying the renal complica￾tions of Fabry disease (41,42). However, a greater apoptotic 
state has been observed in PBMC from Fabry patients (40,43), 
Gb3-induced apoptosis via TGF-β1 and VEGF overexpression 
may be associated with Fabry nephropathy.
In conclusion, we found upregulation of TGF-β1, VEGF, 
VEGFR2, FGF-2 and P-p38 expression in the Fabry mouse 
kidney and in Gb3-treated BAECs. Caspase-6 and -9 activa￾tion was also observed in the Fabry mouse kidney. The 
combined overexpression of TGF-β1 and VEGF by Gb3 may 
allow the upregulation of FGF-2, VEGFR2 and P-p38 expres￾sion. These results suggest that increased expression of these 
proteins is related to Fabry disease nephropathy through the 
induction of apoptosis.
