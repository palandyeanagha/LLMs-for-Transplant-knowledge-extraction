During embryogenesis, the liver is the site of hepatogenesis and hematopoiesis and contains many cell lineages derived from the
endoderm and mesoderm. However, the characteristics and developmental programs of many of these cell lineages remain
unclear, especially in humans. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of whole human and mouse fetal livers throughout
development. We identified four cell lineage families of endoderm-derived, erythroid, non-erythroid hematopoietic, and
mesoderm-derived non-hematopoietic cells, and defined the developmental pathways of the major cell lineage families. In both
humans and mice, we identified novel markers of hepatic lineages and an ID3+ subpopulation of hepatoblasts as well as verified
that hepatoblast differentiation follows the “default-directed” model. Additionally, we found that human but not mouse fetal
hepatocytes display heterogeneity associated with expression of metabolism-related genes. We described the developmental
process of erythroid progenitor cells during human and mouse hematopoiesis. Moreover, despite the general conservation of cell
differentiation programs between species, we observed different cell lineage compositions during hematopoiesis in the human and
mouse fetal livers. Taken together, these results reveal the dynamic cell landscape of fetal liver development and illustrate the
similarities and differences in liver development between species, providing an extensive resource for inducing various liver cell
lineages in vitro.

INTRODUCTION
The liver consists of greater than 20 cell types, including
hepatocytes, biliary ductal cells (cholangiocytes), liver endothelial
cells, hepatic stellate cells, Kupffer cells, mesothelial cells, and
various circulatory immune cells, which are all organized to form
the foundation for liver functions, including nutrient metabolism,
drug detoxification, and immune responses.1–4 Cell lineage
differentiation and organogenesis mainly occur in the fetal stage.
Although the development of certain cell lineages across fetal
development in the mouse liver has been studied,5–8 the cell type
components and their development pathways during embryo￾genesis have not been comprehensively defined, especially in
humans. In addition, a comparative study of fetal liver develop￾ment between two important species, mice and humans, is also
critical to our understanding of the mechanisms of liver
development and regeneration, but we know little about the
degree to which liver development is conserved between humans
and mice.
During embryogenesis, hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, two
major lineages for the majority of liver functions, are derived from
bipotential hepatoblasts, which are widely considered to originate
from the definitive endoderm at 3–4 weeks post-coitum (W) in
humans or at embryonic day (E) 8.5–E9.0 in mice.9 Several
transcription factors (TFs), such as FOXA1/2, GATA4/6, HHEX, and
HNF1A/1B, are involved in hepatoblast specification.9,10 The
differentiation of hepatoblasts into hepatocytes and cholangio￾cytes begins at E13.5 in mice, and characteristic differentiated
hepatobiliary cells can be clearly observed at approximately W7 in
humans.5,11 Several single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)
studies have investigated the developmental processes that
underlie hepatic lineage development.5,12–14 Our previous
scRNA-seq analysis revealed a “default-directed” model of
hepatoblast differentiation in mice.5 In this model, hepatoblasts
that have begun to express hepatocyte function-related genes
choose the default fate of becoming hepatocytes, while cholan￾giocyte differentiation involves a sharp detour from this default
path via de novo activation of additional TFs and multiple
signaling pathways, including the Sox4, Sox9, Hnf1b and Notch,
Tgfb, Wnt, FGF, Hippo-Yap, and MAPK pathways.5,15–22 However,
whether this “default-directed” regulatory strategy is conserved in
humans remains unknown.
In the processes of hepatoblast proliferation and liver bud
formation, surrounding mesoderm-derived cells invade the
developing liver tissue and further differentiate into various
vessels and mesenchymal cells, the latter producing hepatic
stellate cells and mesothelial cells.23 These mesoderm-derived
cells provide critical signals to regulate hepatobiliary development
and contribute to the formation of the liver structure.3 However,

the cell fate of these mesoderm-derived cells in human fetal liver
is largely unknown.
The fetal liver is a fundamental organ for hematopoiesis during
embryogenesis.24 Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells
(HSPCs) that originate from the yolk sac contribute to the first
“wave” of hematopoiesis by producing cells with limited
hematopoietic activities, such as circulating primitive erythrocytes,
megakaryocytes, macrophages, and some granulocytes.25–27
HSPCs derived from the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region
evoke another “wave” of hematopoiesis, circulate in blood vessels,
and seed the fetal liver.28,29 Immigration of HSPCs into the liver
bud occurs at approximately W6 in humans or E12.0 in mice.24,28,30
Then, the fetal liver becomes the major hematopoietic organ and
provides a specific niche for HSPC proliferation and
differentiation.29,30 HSPCs give rise to three main lineages of
blood cells in fetal liver: megakaryocyte–erythroid–mast cells,
lymphoid cells, and myeloid cells.31 Hematopoiesis also promotes
the morphological and functional maturation of hepatocytes in
fetal liver.32 As the liver matures, HSPCs migrate out of the liver
and permanently reside in the bone marrow. Using scRNA-seq,
several recent studies have revealed precise models of hemato￾poiesis in the human fetal liver.31,33–35 However, whether the fetal
liver hematopoiesis model is conserved across species remains
unclear.
In this study, we performed unbiased scRNA-seq of fetal livers
over developmental time from W5 to W19 in humans and from
E11.0 to E17.5 in mice. We systematically identified four major cell
lineage families: endoderm-derived lineages, erythroid lineages,
non-erythroid hematopoietic lineages, and mesoderm-derived
non-hematopoietic lineages, as well as various specific cell types
within each family in humans and mice. We also defined cell
lineage differentiation pathways in the human and mouse fetal
livers. In addition, we observed significant differences in gene
expression, cell composition, cell heterogeneity, and lineage
differentiation pathways during mouse and human fetal liver
development.
RESULTS
Cell population landscapes in the human and mouse fetal livers
We collected fetal livers at 9 time points from W5 to W19 in
humans and 6 time points from E11.0 to E17.5 in mice. At W5–W6
in humans and E11.0–E11.5 in mice, small clusters of red blood
cells were scattered throughout the liver (Supplementary informa￾tion, Fig. S1a). At W7 in humans and E13.0 in mice, the livers were
filled with red blood cells and were completely reddened
(Supplementary information, Fig. S1a). This dramatic morphologi￾cal change indicated that both human and mouse fetal livers
experienced blood immigration and rapid growth during the
period studied in our experiments.
After digestion of isolated fetal livers, we performed unbiased
scRNA-seq using the 10× Genomics platform and obtained a total
of > 100,000 single-cell transcriptomes for each species (Supple￾mentary information, Fig. S1b); we detected an average of ~2000
genes in non-erythrocytes and 1000 genes in erythrocytes (HBA1+,
HBE1+/Hba-a1+, Hba-x+) in the human and mouse samples
(Supplementary information, Fig. S1c). This result is consistent
with the finding that RNA synthesis declines upon erythrocyte
maturation.36 In this study, we used the same software and
strategies to analyze the human and mouse datasets. After
dimension reduction, doublet removal (Supplementary informa￾tion, Fig. S1d), iterative clustering, and batch effect correction, we
identified 13 major cell types across all developmental stages in
both the human and mouse fetal livers based on marker gene
expression (Fig. 1a; Supplementary information, Table S1). These
cell types included hepatoblasts/hepatocytes (HNF4A+, AFP+/
Hnf4a+, Afp+), cholangiocytes (SPP1+/Spp1+), erythroid progeni￾tors (KIT+GATA1+/Kit+Gata1+), erythroblasts (CD71+KIT–
BPGM–
/
Cd71+Kit–
Bpgm–
), early erythrocytes (GYPA+BPGM+/
Gypa+Bpgm+),37,38 primitive erythrocytes (HBE1+/Hba-x+),39
HSPCs (CD34+/Cd27+),40,41 myeloid/lymphoid/megakaryoid cells
(CD45+, ITGA2B+/Cd45+, Itga2b+), Kupffer cells (CD68+, C1QA+/
Cd68+, C1qa+),42,43 septum transversumal cells (STCs) (PDGFRA+,
NCAM1+/Pdgfra+, Ncam1+),3,6 hepatic stellate cells (DCN+, HGF+/
Dcn+, Hgf+),3,6 mesothelial cells (PDPN+/Pdpn+),6 and liver
endothelial cells (VEGFR3+/Vegfr3+) (Fig. 1a, b). Erythropoiesis
was extremely active in the fetal liver; hence, erythrocytes
accounted for a large proportion of the total cells (Fig. 1a).
To understand the conservation and evolutionary differences in
cell types between humans and mice, we performed a cross￾species comparison analysis, which was based on one-to-one
orthologues annotated by the Ensembl genome annotation
system (http://www.ensembl.org/index.html). We found that 13
major cell types were relatively conserved according to the
transcriptomic profiles in human and mouse fetal livers (Fig. 1c).
Curiously, these cell types were clustered into four families, and
based on the nature of the cell types involved, we designated
these families as endoderm-derived lineages (hepatoblasts/
hepatocytes and cholangiocytes), erythroid lineages (erythroid
progenitors, erythroblasts, early erythrocytes, and primitive
erythrocytes), non-erythroid hematopoietic lineages (HSPCs,
Kupffer cells, and myeloid/lymphoid/megakaryoid cells), and
mesoderm-derived non-hematopoietic lineages (hepatic stellate
cells, STCs, mesothelial cells, and liver endothelial cells) (Fig. 1c).
Next, to study the conservation of and differences in gene
regulatory networks between species, we used the WGCNA
algorithm44 to construct weighted gene co-expression networks
(WCGNs) based on genes differentially expressed in the 13 major
cell types. To address differences caused by unbalanced sample
sizes, we sampled 100 cells from each population to generate
balanced datasets. Using these datasets, we constructed human
and mouse topological overlap matrices (TOMs) to generate
species-specific WCGNs. In both species, four cell family-specific
gene modules clustered together (Supplementary information,
Fig. S2a). We also calculated the centrality of each shared gene in
human and mouse WCGNs and observed that the centralities
were highly correlated between human and mouse (Supplemen￾tary information, Fig. S2b). These observations indicate that the
regulatory hierarchy and positions of the regulators in the gene
regulatory networks are conserved between humans and mice.
To study the conservation of and differences in gene expression
patterns, we performed differential expression analysis on the
resampled cells (Materials and Methods) to identify cell type￾specific genes (Fig. 1d; Supplementary information, Table S2).
Next, we focused on the abundant hepatoblasts/hepatocytes and
erythroid progenitors to evaluate differences in gene expression
patterns between species. We calculated the eigengenes of
hepatoblast/hepatocyte- and erythroid progenitor-specific genes
and found that the patterns of the eigengenes were conserved
between humans and mice (Supplementary information, Fig. S2c).
Despite these similarities, we also identified a series of genes that
were specifically correlated with eigengenes of a single species,
indicating the species-specific expression patterns of these genes,
such as ORM1/Orm1, NRN1/Nrn1 and LDHB/Ldhb (Supplementary
information, Fig. S2d, e, Table S3).
Identification of novel hepatic markers
Next, we focused our analysis on endoderm-derived hepatic cells,
including hepatoblasts, hepatocytes, and cholangiocytes (SOX17+
extrahepatic cholangiocytes were excluded from this study).
Several cell surface markers, such as CD13 and DLK1, were found
to label and isolate hepatoblasts/hepatocytes from the mouse
fetal liver.45–47 Based on our scRNA-seq data, we found that these
marker genes were also expressed in the human fetal liver
(Fig. 2a). Additionally, we identified new cell lineage-specific
surface markers for hepatoblasts/hepatocytes, FXYD1 and GJB1, in

both the human and mouse fetal livers (Fig. 2a) and validated their
expression in HNF4A+ hepatocytes in W12 human livers and E17.5
mouse livers by immunofluorescence (Fig. 2b, c). However, we
found that EPCAM, a unique surface marker for cholangiocytes in
mice, was not specific for cholangiocytes in the human fetal liver,
as EPCAM was simultaneously expressed in both cholangiocytes
and erythroid progenitors (Fig. 2a). In addition, the FGB gene
encodes the fibrinogen β chain, and the gene expression profile
database for E14.5 mouse embryos showed that Fgb was uniquely
expressed in the liver (http://www.eurexpress.org). Single-cell
transcriptomic analyses showed that FGB was specifically
expressed in hepatobiliary cell lineages in both humans and mice
(Fig. 2a). Immunostaining of FGB and HNF4A or the cholangiocyte
marker SOX9 in W7 human embryonic liver sections revealed that
FGB was co-distributed with HNF4A+ hepatoblasts/hepatocytes
and the differentiated SOX9+ cells (Fig. 2d; Supplementary

information, Fig. S3a). These findings suggested that a transgenic
mouse strain expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the
Fgb element can be used to trace and genetically manipulate
hepatobiliary lineages. To test this hypothesis, we generated a
transgenic mouse that contained the Fgb promoter adjoined to a
sequence encoding inducible Cre recombinase (Fgb-CreERT2)
(Fig. 2e). These mice were crossed with the Rosa26-tdTomato
strain; pregnant Fgb-CreERT2;Rosa26-tdTomato mice were intraper￾itoneally injected with tamoxifen at E11.5, and embryos were
investigated at E17.5. Compared with WT embryos, in Fgb-CreERT2;
Rosa26-tdTomato embryos, tdTomato signals were exclusively
detected in the liver but not in other major organs (Fig. 2f;
Supplementary information, Fig. S3b). Flow cytometric analysis of
liver cells showed that tdTomato marked an average of 81.9% of
DLK+ hepatocytes and 76.9% of EpCAM+ cholangiocytes (Fig. 2g).
To verify that Fgb is specifically expressed in tdTomato+ cells in
the fetal livers of Fgb-CreERT2;Rosa26-tdTomato mice, we peritone￾ally injected tamoxifen at E11.5 and sorted tdTomato+ and
tdTomato– cells at E14.5 for single-cell reverse transcription
quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) to detect the expression levels of
CreERT2, Fgb, Alb, and Afp. We observed that ~98% of tdTomato+
cells co-express CreERT2, Fgb, Alb, and Afp, but these genes could
not be detected in tdTomato– cells (Supplementary information,
Fig. S3c, d). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) plots also
showed that ~94% of tdTomato+ cells expressed the hepatoblast
marker DLK (Supplementary information, Fig. S3c). Taken together,
these data indicate that Fgb is specifically expressed in
hepatoblasts during the early stage of liver development and
that Fgb-CreERT2 is an efficient tool for tracing and genetic
manipulation of hepatoblasts. Therefore, these datasets provide a
resource for identifying novel cell lineage-specific markers during
hepatogenesis.
Identification of a novel hepatoblast subpopulation
On the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) plot,
the hepatoblasts/hepatocytes sampled at the same developmen￾tal time were generally clustered together, except the cells from
the W5 and W6 human livers and the E11.0 and E11.5 mouse
livers. At these early stages of liver development, from the same
sample, we observed a small cell cluster separate from the main
cluster (Fig. 3a, b). Our analyses revealed that 8% (918 cells of
11,604 cells) of W5–W6 human hepatoblasts and 6% (383 cells of
6269 cells) of E11.0–E11.5 mouse hepatoblasts belonged to this
small cluster. However, after the early stages of liver development,
this cluster could no longer be detected (Fig. 3c). Greater than 100
genes were differentially expressed between the small and the
main clusters (Fig. 3d; Supplementary information, Table S4).
Curiously, the small cluster of cells expressed many mesoderm￾related genes, such as ID3, COL1A1, and HAND2 (Fig. 3d, e), and
gene ontology (GO) analysis showed that this cluster was enriched
in genes involved in mesenchymal and epithelial development
(Supplementary information, Fig. S4a and Table S4). To confirm
the existence of this subgroup of hepatoblasts, we performed
immunofluorescence to validate the existence of HNF4A+ID3+
cells in the W5 human fetal liver and E11.5 mouse fetal liver
(Fig. 3f). We designated these HNF4A+ID3+ cells as ID3+
hepatoblasts. We also used a VEGFR3 antibody to mark the blood
vessels but found that the distribution of HNF4A+ID3+ hepato￾blasts was independent of that of blood vessels (Supplementary
information, Fig. S4b). We reanalyzed our scRNA-seq data that was
previously generated using the Smart-seq2 method5 and detected
a few hepatoblasts with high expression of Id3 (Supplementary
information, Fig. S4c). However, due to the low cell number, these
Id3+ cells could not be identified as an independent cell cluster.
To investigate the fate of ID3+ hepatoblasts, we collected ID3+
hepatoblasts to perform in vitro organoid culture. Our scRNA-seq
data showed that Ncam1 was highly expressed in ID3+ but not
ID3– hepatoblasts. FACS using an NCAM1 antibody could separate
DLKhigh mouse E11.5 hepatoblasts into two clusters, NCAM1+DLK+
and NCAM1–
DLK+ (Supplementary information, Fig. S4d).
NCAM1+DLK+ cells highly express Id3 and were considered as
ID3+ hepatoblasts (Supplementary information, Fig. S4e). Accord￾ingly, NCAM1–
DLK+ cells are ID3– hepatoblasts. We also estimated
the purity of our FACS-sorted cell population using single-cell RT￾qPCR analysis and found it to be ~92.5% (Supplementary
information, Fig. S4f). We then collected the same number of
cells (5000) from the NCAM1+DLK+ and NCAM1–
DLK+ popula￾tions and cultured them on gelatin.48 After 6 days, both
NCAM1+DLK+ and NCAM1–
DLK+ single hepatoblasts formed
colonies and gave rise to HNF4A+ hepatocytes (Fig. 3g, h;
Supplementary information, Fig. S4g). We also cultured
NCAM1+DLK+ and NCAM1–
DLK+ cells on Matrigel.48 After 10 days,
a single hepatoblast formed a cystic structure comprised of SOX9+
cholangiocytes (Fig. 3g, h; Supplementary information, Fig. S4g).
These data indicate that both ID3+ and ID3– hepatoblasts
contribute to liver development. Together, our data reveal a
novel ID3+ hepatoblast subpopulation, although the origin of this
subpopulation needs to be determined.
Recently, Prior et al.14 identified LGR5+ stem and progenitor cells
from the hepatoblast pool at the early stage of liver development.
We examined the expression patterns of LGR5 and found a fraction
of LGR5+ hepatoblasts based on our 10× analysis (Fig. 3e).
Considering the dropping-out effect of the 10× platform, we also
examined the expression pattern of Lgr5 in the published Smart￾seq2 datasets.5 Curiously, at E10.5–E13.5, 80%–90% of hepatoblasts
express Lgr5, but the percentage of Lgr5+ cells dropped to ~40% or
lower starting at E14.5 (Supplementary information, Fig. S5a–d). In
cholangiocytes, Lgr5 expression could not be detected (Supplemen￾tary information, Fig. S5a–d). This finding may suggest that LGR5
expression is associated with bipotent developmental potential of
hepatoblasts. However, on the tSNE plot of the 10× data or the PCA
plot of the Smart-seq2 data, the LGR5+ and LGR5– cells at a specific
developmental stage are intermingled, indicating the transcriptomic
similarity of these cells.
Suzuki et al.49 also identified CD29+CD49f+/lowc￾Kit–
CD45–
TER119– stem cells in the fetal liver, which could be
clonally propagated in vitro and generate hepatocytes and
cholangiocytes. However, when we exanimated the expression
patterns of these genes (CD29, CD49F, KIT, CD45, and TER119 coding
gene GYPA) in our 10× and Smart-seq2 data, we found that
hepatoblasts/hepatocytes possess these characteristic gene expres￾sion patterns (Supplementary information, Fig. S5e–g), indicating
that the stem cells identified by Suzuki et al. were primarily
hepatoblasts. Therefore, these two studies demonstrated the
bipotentiality of hepatoblast function in vitro and in vivo,
respectively.
Conserved “default-directed” pathways of hepatoblast
differentiation in humans and mice
Our previous scRNA-seq of marker-enriched hepatobiliary cells
illustrated that hepatoblast differentiation in mice follows a
“default-directed” model in which the hepatoblast-to-hepatocyte
transition is a progressive process characterized by gradual
changes in gene expression, but the hepatoblast-to￾cholangiocyte transition is a specifically regulated process.5
However, whether human hepatoblasts adopt similar strategies
to differentiate is unclear. We performed differentiation trajectory
analysis of hepatobiliary cells using human and mouse 10×
Genomics datasets. As hepatoblasts/hepatocytes comprised the
majority of detected endoderm-derived cells in our unbiased
dataset, we performed sampling to obtain a small number of
hepatoblasts/hepatocytes and ensured that cholangiocyte-related
genes could be uncovered by a variable gene-finding algorithm.
We then performed principal component analysis (PCA) of the
sampled hepatoblasts/hepatocytes with all detected cholangio￾cytes. In the PCA plots of both human and mouse cells, the

hepatoblast-to-hepatocyte transition formed a main straight
trajectory along PC1, while cholangiocytes followed dispersed
branches along PC2 (Fig. 4a). This pattern was similar to that
identified in our previous experiments in mice using the Smart￾seq2 method. Additionally, ID3+ hepatoblasts were located near
or overlapping with ID3– hepatoblasts and maintained the same
developmental progress in pseudotime along PC1 (Supplementary
information, Fig. S5h). After excluding cell cycle-related genes,
heatmaps from differential expression analysis showed that
group-A/a and group-B/b genes were gradually downregulated
Article
1114
Cell Research (2020) 30:1109 – 1126

or upregulated during hepatoblast-to-hepatocyte differentiation,
whereas cholangiocytes specifically expressed group-C/c genes,
including many TFs, such as SOX4, SOX9, and SOX6, in both
humans and mice (Fig. 4b; Supplementary information, Table S5).
These results suggested that in both species, hepatoblasts default
to the hepatocyte fate and follow a gradual and progressive
transition to hepatocytes, while cholangiocyte differentiation
requires escape from this default fate choice via de novo
activation of regulatory factors.
Using the CellCycleScoring algorithm,50 we identified the cell
cycle phases of human and mouse hepatoblasts/hepatocytes
(Supplementary information, Fig. S5i). Consistent with a previous
study in mice, the proportion of proliferative hepatoblasts/
hepatocytes (the cells in S and G2/M phases) decreased through
human hepatoblast/hepatocyte development. Specifically, these
proliferative cells decreased from W5 (~50%) to W7 (< 20%) in
humans, and at W19, the proportion of proliferative cells was less
than 10% (Fig. 4a, c). Therefore, in both humans and mice, the
proliferation rate of hepatoblasts/hepatocytes decreased through￾out development.
In our previous study, we found that the hepatoblast-to￾hepatocyte transition was completed after E14.5. Hierarchical
clustering analysis of 10× Genomics data also detected a dramatic
switch in gene expression between E14.5 and E16.0 (Fig. 4d),
which is consistent with our previous study.5 Similarly, hierarchical
clustering analysis strongly suggested that the hepatoblast-to￾hepatocyte transition was completed at a time point between W9
and W12 (Fig. 4d). Altogether, these analyses revealed conserved
pathways and characteristics between humans and mice during
hepatic lineage differentiation.
Heterogeneity of human fetal hepatocytes
Based on scaled orthologous genes, we performed PCA of
quiescent hepatoblasts/hepatocytes from humans and mice
(Materials and Methods). All cells were arranged according to
their developmental process along PC1 (Fig. 5a). At the earlier
stages of liver development in both humans and mice, ID3–
hepatoblasts/hepatocytes displayed a nearly homogenous dis￾tribution. However, in the fetal livers of humans but not mice, the
distribution of developing hepatocytes gradually expanded along
PC2 (Fig. 5a). We classified two cell groups based on the PC2-
related gene expression patterns (Fig. 5b, c; Supplementary
information, Table S6). Differential expression analysis showed
that one cell group highly expresses the vitronectin coding gene
VTN, which is mainly expressed in the liver rather than other
organs (https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000109072-VTN/
tissue) (Fig. 5d; Supplementary information, Table S6). We named
this group of cells VTNhigh cells, and correspondingly, the other
group was named VTNlow cells. To validate the heterogeneity of
the maturing human hepatocytes, we analyzed the expression
patterns of RPL13, a gene highly expressed in VTNlow cells, and VTN
in the fetal liver by in situ hybridization. In the W19 human liver,
VTN+ and RPL13+ hepatocytes formed separate cell clusters that
generally presented a mutually exclusive spatial distribution,
unrelated to the positions of the portal veins (PVs) or central
veins (CVs). In contrast, Vtn+ and Rpl13+ cells were widely
distributed and colocalized in E17.5 mouse hepatocytes (Fig. 5e, f).
Differential gene expression and GO analyses of VTNhigh and
VTNlow hepatocytes indicated that highly expressed genes in
VTNhigh cells were enriched for liver functions, including blood
coagulation, detoxification, and organic acid metabolism, while
genes highly expressed in VTNlow cells were associated with
growth and increases in cell mass and had functions in processes
such as ribosome synthesis and protein translation (Fig. 5g;
Supplementary information, Table S6). Notably, at each biological
developmental stage, all of these maturing hepatocytes main￾tained the same developmental pace along maturation pseudo￾time (PC1) (Fig. 5a). In mice, maturing hepatocytes from each
biological stage clustered tightly and displayed homogeneous
expression of Vtn and Rpl13 (Fig. 5a, e, f).
In the adult liver, hepatocytes are heterogeneously distributed
along the axis of the CV and PV. This unique distribution is called
zonation, which organizes metabolism and secretion in a highly
hierarchical structure and facilitates efficient fulfillment of liver
functions. To investigate whether this fetal hepatocyte hetero￾geneity reflects zonation-related hepatocyte heterogeneity, we
identified CV and PV cells based on the expression patterns of
zonation-related genes described in previous scRNA-seq studies of
the adult human liver2 and projected the adult CV and PV cells to
the PCA plot of human fetal hepatocytes. Adult CV and PV
hepatocytes were intermingled along the PC2, and zonation￾related genes, such as GLUL and HAL, did not show distinct
expression patterns in VTNlow and VTNhigh cells (Supplementary
information, Fig. S6a, b). This result indicates that fetal gene
expression heterogeneity is not related to zonation.
In humans, a rare EPCAM+NCAM1+ cell population in W15–W19
and adult livers was recently reported to be putative liver stem
cells named hepatobiliary hybrid progenitors (HHyPs), which have
the potential to differentiate into hepatocytes and
cholangiocytes.13,51 We projected the scRNA-seq data of HHyPs
on the PCA plot of hepatobiliary development, and surprisingly,
we found that HHyPs were projected onto the cholangiocyte
population (Supplementary information, Fig. S7a, b). This result
suggested that HHyPs are cholangiocytes or retain the character￾istics of cholangiocytes.
Erythroid lineage differentiation and maturation pathway in the
fetal liver
The vast majority of cells in the fetal liver were hematopoietic
cells, which were mainly comprised of erythroid cells. HBE1+/Hba￾x
+ yolk sac-derived erythrocytes existed prior to W9 in humans
and E14.5 in mice as the primitive erythrocyte population rapidly
decreased (Fig. 6a). Then, AGM-derived definitive erythrocyte
population rapidly increased. In this study, we focused on the
process of definitive erythropoiesis. We presented cell types at
different stages of erythropoiesis on the UMAP (Fig. 6b). At a given
developmental time, we observed an erythropoiesis path along
erythroid progenitor–erythroblast–early erythrocytes. Interest￾ingly, erythroid progenitors existed at all detected time points
but displayed different transcriptional profiles, especially in the
human fetal liver, suggesting that a transition in progenitor
features occurs throughout fetal development. However, after
differentiation into early erythrocytes, the gene expression
patterns generally converged (Fig. 6b). In both humans and mice,

erythropoiesis could be divided into three different stages:
W7–W9, W12–W14, and W16–W19 in humans and E11.5,
E13.0–E16.0, and E17.5 in mice. Erythroid cells from the same
stage clustered together (Fig. 6b).
Focusing on the erythroid progenitors at different stages, we
performed three-dimensional (3D) PCA and identified develop￾mental pathways of erythroid progenitor development in both
humans and mice; these pathways may reflect the develop￾mental process of fetal erythroid progenitors (Fig. 6c). To confirm
the transcriptomic differences between erythroid progenitors,
we used FACS to isolate colony-forming units-erythroids (CFU-Es)
(cKit+CD71high)
52 from E11.5, E13.0, E16.0, and E17.5 mouse livers
and performed scRNA-seq using a more sensitive well-based
modified STRT-seq (mSTRT-seq) approach53 (Supplementary
information, Fig. S8a). This mSTRT-seq produced single-cell cDNA
and involved barcoding during reverse transcription. Then, the
samples were pooled for library construction to avoid batch
effects caused during library construction and sequencing. In
total, we obtained 301 cells after quality control, with an average
of 200,000 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) and greater than
4000 genes (Supplementary information, Fig. S8b). The sorted
CFU-Es expressed erythroid progenitor markers Kit, Cd71, and
Gata1 (Supplementary information, Fig. S8c). Similarly, we
observed the separation of cell populations at E11.5, E13.0,
E16.0, and E17.5 in the PCA plot (Fig. 6d), and differential
expression analysis identified stage-specific genes (Fig. 6e;
Supplementary information, Table S7). GO analysis revealed that
genes highly expressed at E11.5 were mainly associated with cell
growth and proliferation, which included processes such as
glycolysis and biogenesis of ribonucleoprotein and nucleotides,
while genes highly expressed at E17.5 were involved in
erythrocyte differentiation and terminal functions (Fig. 6f).
Moreover, the Aldoa, Fos, Hk2, and Stat3 genes, which are
important in regulating progenitor characteristic and prolifera￾tion,54–57 were highly expressed at E11.5, whereas the genes
Klf13, Stat5a, and Tcf3, which play roles in regulating erythroid
cell differentiation,58–60 were highly expressed at E17.5. The
expression patterns of these genes and other genes (Aldoa and
Galk1, Fech and Gsta4, and Cela1 and Cirbp, which were highly
expressed in the early, middle, and late developmental stages,
respectively) were validated by single-cell RT-qPCR (Fig. 6g;
Supplementary information, Fig. S8d).
CFU-Es have the ability to proliferate and can directly generate
proerythroblasts, the first erythroid cells recognizable by

morphology.61 For functional validation, we collected CFU-Es for
colony-forming unit (CFU) assays. We isolated the same number
(100,000) of CFU-Es from E11.5 and E17.5 mouse livers and
cultured the single cells in MethoCult GF M3434 medium. After
3 days, we found that there was no difference in the numbers of
colonies between the cultured erythroid progenitors from
different stages. However, the size of colonies from E11.5 erythroid
progenitors was significantly larger than that from E17.5 erythroid
progenitors, indicating that the early erythroid progenitors retain a
high proliferation rate (Fig. 6f, h–j). Altogether, these results
demonstrate that erythroid progenitors are not stable in their own
state and that they are developing while differentiating into
erythrocytes.
Non-erythroid hematopoietic lineage differentiation pathway
We next focused on non-erythroid hematopoietic cells. Using
Seurat,50 we identified 13 cell types in our second round of cell

in humans and E13.0–E16.0 in mice, the cells were generally
clustered together (Supplementary information, Fig. S9a, b),
indicating that non-erythroid hematopoietic cells were continuously
produced and did not show developmental stage-related changes
in gene expression. Using force-directed layout, we analyzed the
cells at W7–W19 in humans and E13.0–E16.0 in mice and delineated

three HSPC-derived lineage differentiation branching paths (Fig. 7a).
We also applied the RNA velocity algorithm83 and Monocle384 to
predict the developmental directions of the cell lineages (Fig. 7b, c).
The HSPC-derived lineage differentiation branching paths, which
were consistent with those described in a previous scRNA-seq study
in humans, were conserved in humans and mice.31 Although
neutrophils were not identified in the human fetal liver, we found
that a large percentage of blood cells in the mouse liver are
neutrophils. In addition, we identified a CD3E+ NK/T cell population
in human but not mouse fetal livers (Fig. 7a–d). These analyses
identified differences in lineage components between human and
mouse hematopoiesis. Overall, single-cell analysis of human and
mouse non-erythroid hematopoietic cell lineages enabled us to
determine the similarities and differences between species.
Generation of Kupffer cells, endothelial cells, and mesenchymal
lineages in the liver
Next, we focused on mesoderm-derived liver-resident cell types,
including Kupffer cells and non-hematopoietic lineages of liver
endothelial cells and liver mesenchymal lineages (hepatic stellate
cells, mesothelial cells, and STCs).23 Together, these cells
accounted for only a small percentage of cells in the fetal liver
(~2.7% in the W19 human fetal liver or ~3.4% in the E17.5 mouse
fetal liver). The t-SNE plot showed that the distributions of these
mesoderm-derived liver-resident cell types at different develop￾mental time points did not overlap, indicating that the maturation
process occurred across fetal development (Supplementary
information, Fig. S9a, b).
Based on the expression patterns of the tissue-specific endothelial
marker genes LYVE1/Lyve1 (sinusoidal endothelial cells), ITGA2/Itga2
(PVs and arteries), ITGA3/Itga3 (PVs), and ITGB4/Itgb4 (CVs and
arteries), we found that vascular endothelial cells (ITGA2+/Itga2+ or
ITGA3+/Itga3+ or ITGB4+/Itgb4+) accounted for a small proportion of
the endothelial cells we identified, while sinusoidal endothelial cells
(LYVE1+/Lyve1+) accounted for most of the endothelial cells
(Supplementary information, Fig. S9c). This finding may be due to
the fact that the digestive conditions used in this study are not
suitable for isolation of vascular endothelial cells.
To investigate the developmental process of Kupffer cells, liver
endothelial cells, and liver mesenchymal cells, we performed
diffusion mapping on these cell clusters. We defined the
continued maturation pathways of Kupffer cells and liver
endothelial cells in humans and mice, and using hierarchical
clustering analysis, we identified genes that were differentially
expressed during the human and mouse maturation processes
(Fig. 8a–d; Supplementary information, Table S8). Liver mesench￾ymal cells were comprised of hepatic stellate cells, STCs, and
mesothelial cells, all of which exhibited clearly distinct differentia￾tion paths on the diffusion map. At early developmental stages,
STCs differentiated into hepatic stellate cells and mesothelial cells,
which then entered maturation processes (Fig. 8e). We identified
cell type-specific genes expressed during liver mesenchymal cell
differentiation (Fig. 8f; Supplementary information, Table S8).
Therefore, using high-throughput scRNA-seq, we detected
mesoderm-derived cell populations with fewer cells in the fetal
liver and identified their differentiation and maturation pathways.
DISCUSSION
Fetal liver development is a complex process that includes
differentiation, immigration, and interaction of many cell lineages
derived from the endoderm and mesoderm. Our understanding of
the overall landscape of fetal liver development is limited. Using
scRNA-seq, we described the comprehensive cell composition and
developmental pathways of the human and mouse fetal livers,
mainly focusing on the processes that comprise hepatogenesis.
The major cell types and developmental pathways were generally
similar between humans and mice; however, we observed
significant differences between species in terms of the gene
expression patterns, heterogeneity, and composition of certain
cell types.
In the W5–W6 human and E11.0–E11.5 mouse fetal livers, we
identified a new subpopulation of ID3+ hepatoblasts that
expressed many mesenchymal-featured genes (Fig. 3a, b, d, e).
These ID3+ hepatoblasts consisted of a considerable proportion of
hepatoblasts at early stages of development that then rapidly
decreased to undetectable levels. In the early stages of liver bud
formation, the septum transversum mesenchyme surrounds and
invades the nascent liver bud. These ID3+ hepatoblasts may be
differentiated from STCs or affected by STCs or other signals to
express mesenchyme-related genes. The origin of ID3+ hepato￾blasts requires further investigation.
In our previous study, we used antibodies against DLK and
EpCAM to sort mouse hepatic lineages for low-throughput smart￾seq2 scRNA-seq,5 and here, we performed high-throughput
analysis using the 10× Genomics platform. The main conclusions
that mouse hepatoblast differentiation follows the “default￾directed” model and the time point of hepatoblast-to￾hepatocyte transition were consistent between these studies. This
study confirmed that the “default-directed” model of hepatoblast
differentiation that was developed in mice is also applicable to
human. However, after W12, human hepatocytes exhibited
heterogeneity; some hepatocytes displayed stronger protein￾producing capacity (VTNlow), and others were more functionally
specialized (VTNhigh) (Fig. 5a–g). Notably, this heterogeneity is
unrelated to hepatocyte zonation (Supplementary information,
Fig. S6a, b). This heterogeneity is absent in murine fetal
hepatocytes. In fact, mouse hepatocytes are more similar to the
human VTNlow state (Fig. 5a) and do not display heterogeneity
(Fig. 5a, e, f). These differences indicated that, in contrast to mouse
hepatocytes, a portion of human hepatocytes may become
functionally active at the early stages of fetal liver development.
Several studies have suggested the existence of liver stem cells
in the fetal liver. Bipotential liver stem cells may differentiate into
both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes or contribute to transdiffer￾entiation between the two cell types.49,51,85 Combining the recent
scRNA-seq studies13 and the marker genes of the identified fetal
liver progenitors, we found that these progenitors are likely
hepatoblasts or a fraction of cholangiocytes that may retain
potential to differentiate into hepatocytes. Prior et al.14 identified
LGR5+ stem and progenitor cells from the hepatoblast pool at the
early stage of liver development, and Suzuki et al.49 also identified
stem cells (CD29+CD49f+/lowc-Kit–
CD45–
TER119–
) in fetal livers.
Given these findings and those from our scRNA-seq analysis, we

concluded that these cells represent hepatoblasts. Recently, Segal
et al.13 performed scRNA-seq of sorted NCAM1+ HHyPs. When we
projected their scRNA-seq data to our data, we found that those
NCAM1+ cells were located within the cholangiocyte population
(Supplementary information, Fig. S7a). Curiously, a previous
lineage tracing study showed that a subset of fetal Sox9+
cholangiocytes can revert to hepatocyte fate during develop￾ment,85 and a study identified human hepatic stem cells located in
the ductal plates in the fetal liver. This finding suggests that
cholangiocytes at the early developmental stage maintain
plasticity to transdifferentiate into hepatocytes. In this study, we
uncovered a subpopulation of ID3+ hepatoblasts only at the
earliest stage of hepatogenesis. ID3+ and ID3– cells are separate
cell clusters on the tSNE plot, indicating that the ID3+ cell
population is distinct from the ID3– population. We also validated
that both ID3+ and ID3– hepatoblasts could give rise to
hepatocytes and cholangiocytes in an in vitro culture system.
Based on these findings, we conclude that we identified a novel
bipotent hepatoblast population.
Few studies have focused on the development of mesoderm￾derived non-hematopoietic lineages in the human fetal liver. In our
study, we found that the differentiation or maturation pathways of
resident STCs, liver endothelial cells, and Kupffer cells followed a
timeline in both the human and mouse fetal livers, similar to the
hepatoblast-to-hepatocyte differentiation pathway (Figs. 4a, b and
8). In addition, we discovered that erythroid progenitors experience
stage changes at the transcriptomic level (Fig. 6b–f). In contrast,
many other hematopoietic lineages (non-erythroid) in the fetal liver

follow a developmental stage-independent process during W7–W19
in humans or E13.0–E16.0 in mice in which the non-erythroid
hematopoietic cell lineages maintain relatively stable expression
profiles (Supplementary information, Fig. S9a). Nevertheless, we
observed that the proportions of various blood lineages differed in
humans and mice (Fig. 7a–d).
Together, our findings provide a clear and comprehensive
understanding of the differentiation processes of all cell types in
the human and mouse fetal livers. Defining the developmental
pathways of various cell types in vivo provides key data needed to
direct cell lineage differentiation and liver organoid construction
in vitro.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mouse lines
All experimental animal protocols were approved by the Institu￾tional Animal Care and Use Committee of Peking University. All
mice were maintained under pathogen-free conditions at 23 ±
2 °C with a 12-h day/night cycle. C3H male and C57BL/6 female
mice were purchased from Vital River Laboratories (Beijing, China).
F1 progenies of C3H and C57BL/6 mice were used. The morning
on which the vaginal plug was detected was defined as E0.5.
Rosa26-tdTomato mice86 were used for tracing.
The Fgb-CreERT2 transgenic mouse strain was generated in this
study. Briefly, the mouse Fgb promoter (~11.0 kb from the
translation start codon) adjoined to the coding sequence of
inducible Cre recombinase CreERT2 was cloned into the pInsulator
vector. The target region of the pInsulator-Fgb-CreERT2 fragment on
the final vector was released by I-CeuI restriction enzyme digestion
and injected into the pronucleus of mouse zygotes. Zygotes were
transplanted into surrogate mice. Transgenic integration was
examined by PCR. Genetically stable transgenic mice were obtained
after at least five generations of mating. Eight- to twelve-week-old
Rosa26-tdTomato females were mated with Fgb-CreERT2 males and
intraperitoneally injected with tamoxifen (Cayman Chemical,
#13258, 4 mg/20 g body weight) at E11.5.
Human embryos
Human embryos were obtained following electively terminated
pregnancies at Haidian Maternal & Child Health Hospital in Beijing.
All experiments were performed in accordance with protocols
approved by the Peking University Institutional Review Board (PU￾IRB) (certificate number: IRB00001052-18083). Written informed
consent was obtained before sample collection. The gender of
human tissues was determined based on the expression patterns
of the Y-chromosome gene RPS4Y1.
Cell sample preparation
For 10× Genomics scRNA-seq, human or mouse fetal livers were
dissociated into single cells by treatment with 0.25% trypsin at 37 °
C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.4 volumes of
FBS. Cells were washed once with PBS and passed through a 50-
μm filter into a new tube. For mSTRT-seq, mouse fetal livers were
directly pipetted to release blood cells. Cells were sequentially
passed through 70-μm and 50-μm filters into new tubes.
scRNA-seq library preparation
For droplet-based scRNA-seq, cDNA preparation and library
construction were conducted using the Single Cell 3′ Reagent
Kit v2 (10× Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s instruc￾tions. For well-based mSTRT-seq, a single targeted cell was picked
up for barcoded cell lysis, and cDNAs from 48–96 different cells
were pooled together. Four cycles of PCR amplification using
biotinylated index primers were conducted to produce 3′ end
biotin-tagged cDNA. After cDNA fragmentation using a Bioruptor
plus (Diagenode), biotin-tagged fragments were captured using
“Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1” beads (Thermo, 65002), and
libraries were constructed using a Kapa Hyper Prep Kit (Kapa
Biosystems, KK8505). The qualities of cDNAs and libraries were
assessed using an Advanced Analytical Fragment Analyzer (AATI).
Immunofluorescence staining
Dissected human or mouse liver tissues were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for at least 12 h and incubated in 30%
sucrose at 4 °C overnight. Samples were embedded in the
optimum cutting temperature (OCT) compound and cut into 5-
μm sections. After blocking with TBST containing 20% FBS,
sections were incubated with anti-FXYD1 (Abcam, ab76597, 1:500),
anti-GJB1 (Abcam, ab66613, 1:500), anti-HNF4A (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, sc-6556, 1:50), anti-SOX9 (Millipore, ab5535,
1:200), anti-FGB (Abcam, ab118533, 1:500), anti-ID3 (Abcam,
ab41834, 1:500), and anti-VEGFR3 (Invitrogen, 14-5988-82, 1:100)
antibodies at 4 °C overnight. After washing, sections were treated
with Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-goat IgG (Invitrogen, A11055,
1:1000), Alexa Fluor 594 donkey anti-goat IgG (Invitrogen, A11058,
1:1000), Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen,
A11008, 1:1000), Alexa Fluor 594 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Invitro￾gen, A21207, 1:1000), Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-rat IgG (Jackson
ImmunoResearch, 712-605-150, 1:250), and Alexa Fluor 488
donkey anti-sheep IgG (Invitrogen, A11015, 1:1000). DAPI (Sigma,
D9564, 0.5 µg/mL) was used for nuclear staining. Images were
acquired using an LSM 710 NLO and DuoScan System (Zeiss).
In situ hybridization
The cDNA templates were derived from human or mouse fetal
liver tissues. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Micro Kit
(Qiagen, 74004) and was reverse transcribed with SuperScript II
Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, 18064014). T7 and SP6 promo￾ter sequences were attached to the 5′ end of gene-specific
primers used to create probes. Probe templates were synthesized
using X5 Plus High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase PCR Mix (2×) (Mei5
Biotechnology, MF006), cloned into the pTOPO-Blunt vector (Mei5
Biotechnology, MF021), validated by sequencing, and linearized
with EcoRI (New England Biolabs, R3101). Riboprobes were
generated using the DIG RNA Labeling Kit (Roche, 11277073910).
Dissected W19 human and E17.5 mouse liver tissues were fixed
in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for at least 12 h and then
incubated in 30% sucrose and 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C
overnight. Fixed samples were embedded in OCT reagent and cut
into 5-μm sequential sections. In situ hybridization was performed
according to a previously described protocol with some modifica￾tions.87 Sections were refixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room
temperature for 20 min. After washing twice with PBS, sections
were incubated in 70% ethanol at 4 °C for at least 1 h. After
washing, sections were treated with proteinase K (Invitrogen,
25530049, 1:1000) in PBST; the proteinase K reaction was
terminated with 2 mg/mL glycine. Antisense riboprobes were
used for hybridization, and BM purple was used for signal
detection. Images were acquired on an AXIOIMAGER M2
fluorescence microscope (Zeiss).
Flow cytometry
Human or mouse liver single-cell suspensions were incubated with
anti-DLK-FITC (MBL, D187-4, 1:100), anti-EpCAM-APC (eBioscience,
17-5791-82, 1:50), anti-NCAM1 (Sangon Biotech, D198946, 1:50),
Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen, A31571,
1:1000), anti-cKit-APC (BioLegend, 105812, 1:200), or anti-CD71-PE
(eBioscience, 113808, 1:200) antibodies at 4 °C for 20 min. After
washing once with PBS, cells were analyzed and sorted using a
FACS Aria SORP cell sorter (BD Biosciences). Dead cells were
excluded by DAPI staining.

HiPer Realtime PCR Super mix with Low Rox (Mei5 Biotechnology,
MF797) on a Roche LightCycler® 480 Instrument II. For bulk-cell RT￾qPCR, total RNA was extracted from the collected cells using the
RNAprep Pure Micro kit (Tiangen, DP420), and reverse transcrip￾tion was performed with HiScript II Q RT SuperMix for RT-qPCR
(Vazyme, R223-1). Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary
information, Table S9.
Hepatoblast differentiation in vitro
For hepatocyte differentiation, the collected hepatoblasts were
plated on gelatin-coated (Sigma) 24-well dishes for 6 days. For
cholangiocyte differentiation, the collected hepatoblasts were
plated on Matrigel-coated (BD Bioscience) 24-well dishes for
10 days. Cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 (Gibco) medium
supplemented with 10% FBS, 1× ITS-X (Invitrogen), 1× Penicillin￾Streptomycin (Gibco), 25 ng/mL hEGF, 25 ng/mL hHGF, and 40
ng/mL dexamethasone (Sigma). For immunostaining, cells were
stained with anti-SOX9 (Millipore, ab5535, 1:200), anti-HNF4A
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-6556, 1:50), Alexa Fluor 488
donkey anti-goat IgG (Invitrogen, A11055, 1:1000), and Alexa
Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen, A11008, 1:1000).
DAPI (Sigma, D9564, 0.5 µg/mL) was used for nuclear staining.
Images were acquired using an LSM 710 NLO and DuoScan
System (Zeiss).
Mouse CFU assays
Collected cells were washed twice with Iscove’s MDM plus 2% FBS,
added to MethoCult GF M3434 medium (Stemcell Technologies),
and vortexed. Cells were plated on 12-well plates and incubated
for 3 days. Images were acquired on an AXIOIMAGER M2
fluorescence microscope (Zeiss).
scRNA-seq and data preprocessing
The 10× Genomics libraries were sequenced as 150-bp paired-end
reads on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform. Raw files were
processed with Cell Ranger 2.0.2 using the default parameters.
Human and mouse reads were respectively mapped to the
GRCh38 or mm10 reference genomes version 1.2.0 provided by
10× Genomics (https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell￾gene-expression/software/downloads/latest). Cell filtering was
performed with Cell Ranger using the default settings.
Preprocessed data normalization and variable gene identification
Preprocessed data were imported into the Seurat v2.2.1 R
package.50 The UMI counts of each cell were normalized using
the “NormalizeData” function with a scale factor of 10,000. Then,
variable genes were identified using the “FindVariableGenes”
function.
Dimension reduction, RNA velocity, and trajectory analysis
PCA was performed based on the variable genes. We further
performed t-SNE based on the PCA subspaces.
For the developmental trajectory visualization, we applied three
independent algorithms: FDL, UMAP, and diffusion map. Before
dimensional reduction, we performed hierarchical clustering of
variable genes and removed cell cycle-related genes and
transcripts from contaminated blood cells. FDL was performed
using the R package igraph v1.2.2 (https://cran.r-project.org/web/
packages/igraph/) based on the shared nearest neighbor (SNN)
matrix, which was built using the “BuildSNN” function in Seurat.
UMAP and diffusion map analyses were performed using the
functions “RunUMAP” and “RunDiffusion” in Seurat, respectively.
We fitted the development pathway with a principal curve
(smoothing spline fitness) using princurve v2.1.3 (https://cran.r￾project.org/web/packages/princurve/).
RNA velocity was determined using velocyto v0.17.1683 with
default parameters and analyzed using the function “gene.relative.
velocity.estimates” in the R package velocyto.R v0.683 with
parameters “kCells = 10, fit.quantile = 0.02”. The embedding of
arrows representing RNA velocity was performed using the
function “show.velocity.on.embedding.cor” in velocyto.R with
parameters “n = 30, scale = sqrt’”.
Trajectory analysis was performed using the R package
Monocle3 v0.2.0.84 The preprocessing and dimension reduction
were performed using the functions “preprocess_cds” and
“reduce_dimension” in Monocle3 with default parameters. The
trajectories were calculated using the function “learn_graph” in
Monocle3 with the parameter “minimal_branch_len = 2” based on
defined cell clusters.
Cell clustering, doublet identification, batch effect correction, and
differential expression analysis
Cell clustering was performed with the whole dataset using the
“FindClusters” function in Seurat. Three major cell populations of
endoderm-derived cells, erythrocytes, and other mesoderm￾derived cells were separately isolated as subset data. Each
population was subjected to next round of clustering using the
same procedure. To identify detailed cell subtypes in non￾erythroid blood cells, we separately isolated E11.0–E11.5,
E13.0–E16.0, and E17.5 mouse non-erythroid blood cells and
W7–W19 human non-erythroid blood cells from other mesoderm￾derived cells and performed clustering.
Doublet identification was performed using the following
method. First, to simulate the transcriptomic state of doublets,
we randomly sampled 10% of cells from the whole dataset twice
to form two cell subsets. Cells in two subsets were merged to
make artificial doublets. We performed PCA on the union of the
artificial doublets and the whole datasets using the Seurat
standard pipeline. Based on the PCA space, the proportion of
artificial doublets in the top 1% of cells nearest to each cell was
considered the cell’s doublet index. Cells with doublet indices in
the top 10% were considered putative doublets.88 Next, we
performed differential expression analysis between putative
doublets and normal cells to define doublet-related genes.
Dimension reduction and clustering were performed based on
the doublet-related genes using the Seurat standard pipeline. The
clusters with high putative doublet percentages were defined as
definitive doublets. For other mesoderm-derived non-erythroid
cells, we identified hemoglobin genes enriched in the PC using
PCA and performed clustering based on hemoglobin-related
genes. Then, doublets derived from erythrocytes were identified
and removed.
To eliminate batch effects among different stages, we
performed batch effect correction using the “scanorama.correct”
function in the Python package Scanorama89 with default
parameters.
To overcome biases due to unbalanced sample sizes, we
searched the differentially expressed genes of 13 cell populations
using the following procedure. We sampled 100 cells per cell
population to form a balanced dataset. To minimize disturbances
due to dropping out, we performed imputation of this dataset
using scImpute90 with default parameters. Then, differential
expression analysis was performed on this dataset using the
function “FindAllMarkers” in Seurat. To ensure robustness, we
repeated the sampling and differential expression analysis 50
times. Differentially expressed genes with P values < 10–20 were
recorded. Differentially expressed genes that were reproducible
with 50 replicates were defined as specific differentially expressed
genes in the 13 cell populations.
To determine the differentially expressed genes on the
development pathways, we performed differential expression
analysis among various developmental stages, and classified the
differentially expressed genes using hierarchical clustering. Next,
we used a heatmap to present gene clusters related to
development processes (cell cycle-related genes and contami￾nated blood cell-related genes were filtered out).

Cross-species comparison and weighted correlation network
analysis
Our cross-species comparison was based on one-to-one ortholo￾gues annotated by the Ensembl genome annotation system
(http://www.ensembl.org/index.html). The average expression
levels in 13 major cell types were calculated. Pearson correlations
of 13 major cell types in human and mouse were used to
determine cross-species similarities.
Weighted correlation network analysis was performed using the
WGCNA algorithm.44 To overcome biases due to unbalanced
sample sizes, we sampled 100 cells per cell population to form a
balanced dataset. Based on the differentially expressed genes in
the 13 major cell types, we constructed human and mouse TOMs
to generate species-specific WCGNs.
To determine the similarity and difference between human
and mouse WCGNs, we calculated the centrality of each shared
gene in the human and mouse WCGNs, which was equal to the
sum of the neighbor edge weights of a node in the WCGN.
Pearson correlation between the human and mouse centralities
was used to evaluate the structure similarity between human
and mouse WCGNs. To identify the different expression patterns
of hepatic cells and erythroid cells, we individually calculated
the eigengene of each cell type’s differentially expressed
genes.44 Next, for each gene, we calculated the gene-to￾human eigengene and gene-to-mouse eigengene Pearson
correlations. Genes specifically correlated with the eigengene
of one species (Pearson correlations > 0.5) but not correlated
with the other (the differences between Pearson correlations of
two species > 0.5) were regarded as having species-specific
expression patterns.
Identification of proliferative cells in hepatoblasts/hepatocytes
We identified the cell cycle phases of hepatoblasts/hepatocytes
using the “CellCycleScoring” function in Seurat with the para￾meters “g2m.genes = g2m.genes, s.genes = s.genes, n.bin = 10”.
The reference genes used to determine the S and G2/M phases
were based on the default cell cycle-related gene list in Seurat.
Analysis of hepatoblast differentiation pathways
Due to the unbalanced population sizes of hepatocytes and
cholangiocytes, we first performed sampling of hepatoblasts/
hepatocytes. According to the size of the cholangiocyte popula￾tion, we collected 250 hepatoblasts/hepatocytes at each stage for
human samples and 80 hepatoblasts/hepatocytes at each stage
for mouse samples. The sampled hepatoblasts/hepatocytes were
concatenated with all cholangiocytes and underwent PCA
dimensional reduction. We calculated the Pearson correlation
between PC1/2 scales and gene expression values to define PC1/
2-related genes. Next, hierarchical clustering was performed on
PC1/2-related genes to identify hepatocyte- and cholangiocyte￾related genes.
Combination of human and mouse hepatoblasts/hepatocytes
To analyze the heterogeneity of human and mouse hepatoblasts/
hepatocytes, we combined the human and mouse datasets using
the following procedure. First, we excluded species-specific genes
of the human and mouse datasets based on orthologous genes
annotated by the Ensembl genome annotation system (http://
www.ensembl.org/index.html). Next, we separately identified the
variable genes and performed scaling on gene expression
matrices from the human and mouse datasets to reduce the
species-derived difference. The scaled matrices from humans and
mice were combined, and PCA was performed based on the union
set of human and mouse variable genes.
Analysis of mSTRT-seq data
The mSTRT-seq libraries were sequenced as 150-bp paired-end
reads on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform. Raw files (fastq format)
were separated based on cell-specific barcode sequences. PolyA
sequences were trimmed from R1 reads (3′ end of cDNA).
Preprocessed R1 reads from each cell were then aligned to the
Mus musculus reference genome GRCm38/mm10 with TopHat
V2.1.0. Bam files were annotated to genes with featureCounts
(v1.5.3).91 We used samtools (v1.3.1)92 to sort and index the output
bam files. UMIs of each gene were counted with umi-tools
(v0.5.0)93 with the “unique” method. Next, the UMI count matrix
was imported into Seurat v2.2.1 and transformed into transcripts
per 0.1 million (TP0.1M), which normalized the number of total
transcripts in one single-cell library to 100,000. Then, TP0.1M was
further ln-normalized [lnTP0.1M]. Cells with < 4000 detected genes
were removed from further analyses. Dimension reduction and
differential expression analysis were performed using Seurat as
described previously.
GO enrichment analysis
GO enrichment analysis was performed using the R package
clusterProfiler v3.10.0.94
Statistics
A two-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare
differentially expressed genes between populations and analyze
single-cell RT-qPCR results.
