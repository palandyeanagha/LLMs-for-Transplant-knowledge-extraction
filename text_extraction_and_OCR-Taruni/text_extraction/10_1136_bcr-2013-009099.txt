SUMMARY
Cryptococcal peritonitis is a rare disease. Although the
respiratory tract is considered to be the usual port of
entry for the organism, the gastrointestinal tract can also
serve as the potential site of entry. Here, we present a
case of cryptococcal peritonitis that developed in an HIV￾negative patient with underlying liver cirrhosis. We
reviewed the literature and a total of 61 cases of
cryptococcal peritonitis were identified. Liver cirrhosis,
HIV/AIDS and end-stage renal disease on continuous
ambulatory peritoneal dialysis were the major risk factors
for developing crytococcal peritonitis.
BACKGROUND
Cryptococcal peritonitis is an uncommon infection.
Although the respiratory tract is the usual port of
entry for the organism, the gastrointestinal (GI)
tract can also serve as a potential site of entry when
the organism is ingested or via direct blood stream
inoculation following upper GI bleeding.1 2
Here, we present a case of cryptococcal peritonitis
that presented with increased abdominal distension
and generalised fatigue. Abdominal paracentesis was
performed and the patient was started on empiric
treatment for suspected spontaneous bacterial peri￾tonitis (SBP). However, the culture of ascitic fluid
grew Cryptococcal neoformans. This patient presen￾tation warrants the fact that the physicians should
have a broad perspective in mind when dealing with
patients who present with typical symptoms that
might be pointing towards an obvious pathological
process. However, the causative agent can be atypical,
as it was evident in this case.
CASE PRESENTATION
A 60-year-old man, with a medical history of liver
cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis B and hepatitis C,
presented with increased abdominal distension and
fatigue.
In the preceding 6 months, he had multiple
admissions for treatment of hepatic encephalopathy
and for banding of oesophageal varices. His HIV
status was known to be negative.
On physical examination vital signs were stable.
The abdomen was distended with shifting dullness
to percussion and normal bowel sounds but
without tenderness or guarding. His neurological
examination was grossly normal. During the hospi￾talisation, the patient had nausea, diffuse abdom￾inal discomfort and subsequently his mental status
began to deteriorate.
INVESTIGATIONS
Full blood count revealed haemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL,
white blood cell (WBC) count of 8600/mm3 and
platelets of 53 000/mm3
. The electrolytes were all
within normal range. Liver function testing showed
aspartate transaminase of 69 U/L, alanine transamin￾ase of 35 U/L, alkaline phosphatase of 107 IU/L and
total bilirubin of 1.9 mg/dL. Prothrombin time was
21 s, partial thromboplastin time was 38 s and the
international normalized ratio was 2. Chest X-ray
showed small bilateral pleural effusions, with under￾lying atelectasis. An ultrasound-guided paracentesis
was performed and 2 L of cloudy, yellow ascitic fluid
was removed. Ascitic fluid showed 300/mm3 RBCs,
1250/mm3 WBCs with 90% lymphocytes, total pro￾teins of 782 mg/dL (serum total proteins: 7.6 g/dL),
albumin of 272 mg/dL (serum albumin: 2.3 g/dL)
and a negative Gram stain. Within few days the
patient’s ascitic fluid culture grew Cryptococcus
neoformans.
Upon deterioration of the patient’s mental status,
he underwent CT of the head which revealed no
acute intracranial abnormality and a lumbar punc￾ture was performed. The opening pressure was
about 200 mm H2O. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
analysis showed 214/mm3 WBCs (95% lympho￾cytes), 125 mg/dL proteins, 5 mg/dL glucose and
121 mEq/L chloride. CSF cryptococcal antigen by
latex agglutination test (LAT) was positive. Tests to
identify bacterial pathogens, other fungi and
viruses were negative. Furthermore, blood crypto￾coccal antigen by LAT was positive as well. All the
procedures were performed in complete aseptic
conditions to avoid contamination.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The initial concern was of possible SBP compli￾cated with hepatic encephalopathy. Initially, the
patient was started empirically on ceftriaxone for
suspected SBP. He was started on lactulose and
rifaximin for treatment of suspected hepatic
encephalopathy as well.
The patient had prior presentations with hepatic
encephalopathy, which were associated with epi￾sodes of GI bleeding and responded well to
medical therapy with complete resolution of
encephalopathy, but this time the encephalopathy
persisted despite medical therapy targeting hepatic
encephalopathy. The ascitic fluid culture confirmed
cryptococcal peritonitis and subsequently the
lumbar puncture confirmed cryptococcal meningitis
as a cause of his change of mental status.
TREATMENT
Treatment was started with amphotericin B and
fluocytosine, but shortly the patient developed
acute renal failure and the antifungal therapy was
switched to fluconazole.

OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP
The patient’s condition deteriorated over a week with hypoten￾sion that required treatment in the intensive care unit. The
patient and his family elected to undergo home hospice care.
Two weeks later, the patient had haematemesis with rapid
deterioration of his condition and he died.
DISCUSSION
The genus Cryptococcus includes almost 40 species of which C.
neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii are considered truly patho￾genic in humans.3 Although other cryptococcal species rarely
cause true infections, both Cryptococcus curvatus and
Cryptococcus laurentii were described as a cause of peritonitis
associated with gastric lymphoma and peritoneal dialysis,
respectively.3 4 Of these pathogenic strains in humans, C. neo￾formans, which is encapsulated yeast, is mainly pathogenic in
immunocompromised patients.
Cryptococcal organisms can be identified on cytology as
narrow-based budding yeasts surrounded by a polysaccharide
capsule. Different C. neoformans serotypes are based on the anti￾gens present on the capsule. The capsule is periodic acid-Schiff
positive that additionally stains strongly with mucicarmine stain.
Also, the capsule can be readily demonstrated by the use of India
ink stain.256 The Fontana-Masson stain can reveal the melanin
contained in the yeast cell wall and it can be useful in some cases
with poorly encapsulated Cryptococci.7 The major virulence
factors for C neoformans are the antiphagocytic polysaccharide
capsule, phenol oxidase enzyme that offers an antioxidant pro￾tective effect via catalysing melanin production and the tempera￾ture tolerance exhibited by the organism.8
Cryptococcal infections range from pulmonary involvement
to disseminated disease that frequently involves central nervous
system. However, cryptococcal peritonitis is a rare disease with
a total of 61 cases reported between 1951 and 2012.1–6 9–54
Among all these cases, the mean age was 45 years and the
ages ranged from 13 to 64 years. Underlying pathologies
included cirrhosis in 45.9%, chronic kidney disease on continu￾ous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis in 24.60% and HIV/AIDS in
19.7% (figure 1).
In these patients, the diagnosis of cryptococcal peritonitis was
established by paracentesis and analysis of the peritoneal fluid.
Along with the evidence of cryptococcal infection in the peri￾toneal fluid, positive specimens were also found in blood
(36.10%), CSF (16.40%) and urine (8.20%). Other biological
specimens also revealed the presence of cryptococcus, although
their frequency was low (figure 2). Of all the patients whose
outcome could be determined, 41% died (figure 3). Analysing
the current data present on cryptococcal peritonitis suggests that
the predisposing factors for this rare disease are similar to those
seen in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.25
Patients who have hepatic disease are already at increased risk
of infections due to impaired phagocytic function of leucocytes,

hypocomplementaemia, increased use of antibiotics with pos￾sible fungal overgrowth, the necessity to carry out invasive pro￾cedures that may cause direct inoculation of the organism and
due to GI bleeding which can cause translocation of the organ￾ism into the blood stream from GI sites.2 6 10 11 All these
factors act in concert to make the patient more vulnerable to
cryptococcal infection.5
Patients with cryptococcal peritonitis usually have initial
symptoms of abdominal pain, fever, increased abdominal girth
besides non-specific signs and symptoms upon presentation
which makes the diagnosis challenging.2 9 13 14 However, with
the assistance of ascitic fluid cytology and simultaneous India
ink preparation, the patient can be readily evaluated for the pos￾sibility of cryptococcal peritonitis. Although culture is the gold
standard for diagnosis of cryptococcal infection, the diagnosis
of cryptococcal peritonitis can be delayed if cytological analysis
of the ascitic fluid is not employed.
In conclusion, despite being a rarity, cryptococcal infection
should be considered in the differential diagnosis whenever
evaluating a patient with an advanced liver disease and possible
peritonitis, especially with concomitant immunocompromised
state.
Learning points
▸ An uncommon causative organism can be missed if the
patient presents with manifestations of a common
pathology.
▸ A thorough workup of the patient is essential when the
presenting symptoms are not responding to the routine
treatment employed.
▸ Cryptococcal peritonitis can mimic spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis, yet discerning the organism can be a diagnostic
challenge and cannot be always determined, particularly if
the suspicion is not broad-based in the initial workup.
▸ Although an uncommon cause of peritonitis, fungal
peritonitis in general needs to be in the list of differential
diagnoses when a patient with relevant history and
comorbid conditions presents to the healthcare facility,
especially when the routine therapeutic measures are not
proving to be effective.
