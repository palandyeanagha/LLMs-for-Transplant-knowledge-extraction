In the United States (US), since the implementation of the 
model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scoring system in 
2002, there has been a substantial increase in the number of 
liver transplantation (LT) candidates simultaneously suffer￾ing from renal dysfunction [1]. To deal with these high-MELD 
score recipients with pre-transplant renal dysfunction, some 
transplantation centers in the US have started to incorporate in￾traoperative renal replacement therapy (ioRRT). Unfortunately, 
a significant amount of strong evidence validating the usefulness 
of ioRRT during LT is scarce. In Korea, LT candidate prioritiza￾tion changed from the Child Turcotte Pugh scoring system to 
the MELD scoring system in June 2016. Accordingly, as it has 
been shown in the US, the number of LT recipients having pre￾transplant renal dysfunction will likely rapidly increase. Conse￾quently, increasing cases of intraoperative complications, includ￾ing hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and volume overload are 
expected during LT. Additionally, decisions regarding the need 
for ioRRT will be addressed more frequently to anesthesiolo￾gists. As such, it seems to be a reasonable moment to retrospec￾tively discuss our current state and to prepare for post-MELD 
era challenges. 
Currently, our institutional strategy does not include the 
performance of ioRRT due to its lack of supporting evidence. 
We have managed over 1,700 cases of LT without ioRRT to date. 
Although there is a strong expectation that ioRRT would be 
beneficial for recipients with pre-transplant renal dysfunction, 
there is little evidence supporting the decision to accept ioRRT 
as a routine practice. Theoretically, simultaneous liver and kid-
 Case Report
Since the implementation of the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scoring system in 2002, the liver transplanta￾tion (LT) society has observed a substantial increase in the number of recipients with renal dysfunction. Intraoperative 
renal replacement therapy (ioRRT) has emerged as one of the solutions available to manage high-MELD score recipients; 
however, its usefulness has not yet been proven. To date, we have experienced five cases of simultaneous liver and kidney 
transplantation (SLKT). Recipients of SLKT tend to have a lower pre-transplant kidney function and the longer operation 
time mandates a larger amount of fluid than LT alone. Hence, anesthetic care is more prone to be challenged by hyper￾kalemia, metabolic acidosis, and volume overload, making ioRRT a theoretically valuable intervention. However, in all 
five cases, recipients were managed without ioRRT, resulting in excellent graft and patient survival. As such, in this case 
series, we discuss current issues about ioRRT and SLKT.

ney transplantation (SLKT) recipients are more suitable candi￾dates for ioRRT than those undergoing LT alone, as recipients 
of SLKT have irreversible kidney disease that is not expected to 
improve following LT without the assistance of a kidney trans￾plant (KT) procedure. In addition, patients undergoing SLKT 
experience a longer operation time and require a larger amount 
of fluids. Therefore, we felt it was beneficial to gather relevant 
SLKT cases and analyze them with respect to the inclusion of 
intraoperative renal dysfunction management. Discussions on 
ioRRT and SLKT will follow. 
Case Report
Five cases of SLKT have been performed in our institute 
since our first LT procedure in 1996. Four recipients had end￾stage liver disease due to hepatitis B virus, and one recipient had 
cryptogenic liver failure. Patients’ MELD scores ranged from 21 
to 23. Two recipients had hyponatremia preoperatively, and one 
recipient was managed in the intensive care unit (ICU) before 
the operation, but the patient did not require vasoactive drugs or 
ventilator therapy. None of the patients who underwent SLKT at 
our institute showed hepatorenal syndrome or encephalopathy 
prior to the operation. 
In addition to liver disease, all of the five patients had renal 
dysfunction. Three had diabetic chronic kidney disease and one 
had membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. The remain￾ing one had unspecified glomerulonephritis and received KT 
in 2005, though the transplanted kidney became dysfunctional 
when he was hospitalized for the SLKT. All of the patients 
showed heterogeneity in kidney pathology, but none were 
expected to recover without a KT. Three of the patients had 
received preoperative renal replacement therapy (RRT), two via 
hemodialysis, and one via peritoneal dialysis. Kidney function 
assessed by serum creatinine (SCr)-based estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR) ranged from 3 to 46 ml/min. All SCr val￾ues were obtained before RRT. These three recipients received 
preoperative RRT a day before the scheduled operation. Addi￾tional detailed information of the recipients is shown in Table 1.
Operational procedures
During the SLKT procedures, we focused on keeping not 
only adequate blood pressure without volume overload, but also 
homeostasis of the acid-base, electrolytes, and coagulation sys￾tem. First, intravenous fluids comprised of both crystalloids and 
colloids were infused, targeting a mean arterial pressure over 70

mmHg. In cases C and D, 0.9% saline was mainly infused while 
in case A, plasma solution A was mainly infused, as we changed 
maintenance fluid during LT from 0.9% saline to Plasma so￾lution A (CJ Healthcare, Seoul, Korea). In cases B and E, the 
recipients had hyponatremia (124 mEq/L and 129 mEq/L, re￾spectively) and so, 0.45% saline was the main fluid administered 
during the operations to prevent central pontine myelinolysis [2]. 
A continuous infusion of dopamine, norepinephrine, and vaso￾pressin was also an effective option to maintain the target blood 
pressure. A large caliber central line (AVA, Edwards, Irvine, CA, 
USA) and pulmonary arterial catheter (Swan Ganz SvO2, Ed￾wards, Irvine, CA, USA), with the aid of a corresponding moni￾toring system (Vigilance II, Edwards, Irvine, CA, USA), were 
utilized to choose the appropriate fluid and drug infusion rate. 
Second, any imbalances of acid-base and electrolytes were 
monitored and corrected immediately. We performed arte￾rial blood gas analysis from the start of operation and once 
every hour. A complete blood cell count, determination of 
international normalized ratio of prothrombin time (PT INR), 
activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, and throm￾boelastography were performed every two hours. At the start of 
both the anhepatic and the reperfusion phases, we set the clock 
to zero and recounted the time. Additional blood samples were 
collected at 10 minutes pre-reperfusion, and 5 and 30 minutes 
post-reperfusion. Ionized calcium values, below 0.8 mmol/L, 
were handled with 300 mg of calcium chloride. Potassium values 
over 4.5 mEq/L in pre-reperfusion period were handled with 10 
international units (IU) or 5 IUs of regular insulin (RI) boluses, 
followed by a 5% dextrose solution infusion. To deal with meta￾bolic acidosis, we infused 1 liter of 0.45% saline containing 80 
mEq of sodium bicarbonate in cases in which base excess (BE) 
was below −10 mmol/L. However, in the first case (case E), we 
used a lower BE value to initiate bicarbonate infusion than that 
we use today [3].
Lastly, a strict rule was applied to every decision involving 
blood product transfusion. In total, 300 ml of Cell SaverⓇ (Hae￾monetics, Braintree, MA, USA) blood was infused in cases in 
which hemoglobin (Hb) was below 9 g/dl, and two units of leu￾kocyte-depleted red blood cells (LDRBC) were infused in cases 
in which Hb was below 8 g/dl. Additionally, we prepared two 
units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for when PT INR was above 3 
and one unit of single-donor platelet for when platelet count was 
below 30,000 /µl. Also, we infused six units of cryoprecipitates 
in cases in which fibrinogen was below 80 mg/dl, but only three 
units of cryoprecipitates when platelet count was above 50,000 /
µl, even if the fibrinogen was below 80 mg/dl. Operation time 
as well as total input and output are shown in Table 2. The most 
extreme results of the potassium and BE interventions we carried

out are shown in Table 3. Figs. 1 and 2 are time series plots dem￾onstrating the results of the laboratory tests and interventions.
Hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis
 In cases A, C, and D, one RI bolus was needed in each pre￾reperfusion period (because potassium values were 4.6 mEq/L, 
4.5 mEq/L, and 4.5 mEq/L, respectively). In case E, RI bolus was 
not required in the pre-reperfusion period, but two RI boluses 
were given in the post-reperfusion period (because potassium 
values were 5.4 mEq/L and 5.1 mEq/L, respectively). In case B, 
RI bolus was not required at any point throughout the opera￾tion. 
In cases A and C, BE values were kept above −10 mmol/
L, throughout the operation, and sodium bicarbonate infusion 
was not needed. In case D, 80 mEq of sodium bicarbonate was 
infused in the pre-reperfusion period (BE value was −11.0 
mmol/L at two hours into the operation) and another 80 mEq of 
sodium bicarbonate was infused in the post-reperfusion period 
(BE value was −15.5 mmol/L at seven hours post-reperfusion). 
In case E, 50 mEq of sodium bicarbonate was infused in the pre￾reperfusion period (BE value was −16.1 mmol/L at one hour 
into the anhepatic) but sodium bicarbonate was not followed 
even when the BE decreased to lower than −15 mmol/L in the

post-reperfusion period. On the contrary, in case B, vigorous 
efforts to keep the BE above −10 mmol/L in both the pre- and 
post-reperfusion periods were carried out. A total amount of 
480 mEq of sodium bicarbonate was infused as a result. Ironi￾cally, this patient, who received the most aggressive sodium 
bicarbonate therapy, died a month after the operation. He was 
the only recipient who received both deceased liver and kidney 
grafts, and also the only one who received continuous renal 
replacement therapy (CRRT) after the operation. Our aggres￾sive sodium bicarbonate infusion therapy worked effectively 
throughout the operation. However, inappropriate function of 
the deceased liver and kidney grafts, to our knowledge, initiated 
the fatal clinical outcome in the post-operative period.
Metabolic acidosis was managed tightly in four of the cases 
(in cases A, B, C, and D). In case E, however, the BE value to 
initiate the infusion of sodium bicarbonate was lower than that 
we use today [3]. As a result, less aggressive sodium bicarbon￾ate infusion therapy was conducted, and even a BE value below 
−15 mmol/L was observed without intervention. However, as 
the kidney graft successfully functioned, the laboratory results 
all converged to normal after the operation, and hemodynamic 
instability remained unreported during the operation.
None of the five recipients showed signs or symptoms of vol￾ume overload in the post-operative period. Post-operative chest 
X-rays revealed absence of pulmonary edema and/or pleural 
effusion in all cases. The PaO2/FIO2 value before extubation at

ICU was 254 (A), 361 (B), 418 (C), 263 (D) and 256 (E), respec￾tively. Laboratory results other than potassium and BE during 
the operation are shown in Table 4, while laboratory results at 
ICU are shown in Table 5. Length of hospital stay, patients and 
grafts survival rates are shown in Table 6.
Accumulation of wasted materials
Even if potassium and metabolic acidosis were managed 
sufficiently without the use of ioRRT, it is unknown how much 
waste material is being accumulated during the operation. To 
identify it, in the most recent case (case A), we performed an ad￾ditional laboratory test just before the reperfusion of the kidney 
graft. It took approximately 12 hours from the start of the opera￾tion to the reperfusion of the kidney graft. Blood urea nitrogen 
and SCr values before the operation were 17 mg/dl and 1.93 mg/
dl respectively, and they decreased to 11.7 mg/dl and 1.31 mg/dl 
just before the kidney reperfusion. Total input and output at that 
moment were 15,100 ml of crystalloid, 1,670 ml of 5% albumin, 
1,000 ml of 6% Hextend (CJ Healthcare, Seoul, Korea), 500 ml 
of 6% Volulyte (Fresenius Kabi, Bad Homburg, Germany), 430 
ml of 15% mannitol, 1,439 ml of Cell SaverⓇ blood, two units of 
LDRBC, four units of FFP, six units of cryoprecipitate, and 2,140 
ml of urine output. Total estimated blood loss was 5,175 ml. We 
discussed the decrement of SCr during the operation and postu￾lated that the decrement of body waste could be the result of the

removal of a huge amount of body fluid via surgical bleeding. 
Meanwhile, supplementation of fluids and fresh blood products 
mimicked the function of ioRRT. 
Discussion
In the Korean Journal of Anesthesiology, four case reports of 
SLKT were identified. In 2002, Lee et al. [4] reported a case of 
SLKT (living liver and kidney donor) in a 45-year-old man re￾ceiving preoperative hemodialysis. Authors discussed the case 
with transplant surgeons and decided not to use ioRRT because 
of its unfamiliarity. Instead, they decided to implant the kidney 
graft earlier and the liver graft later, to ease the intraoperative 
management of renal dysfunction. Liver grafting is usually im￾planted earlier than kidney grafting to avoid kidney graft hypo￾perfusion during the liver reperfusion period, and to shorten the 
ischemia time of liver grafting, which is known to be more more 
limited than that of the kidney grafting. However, the authors in 
that case concluded that in the living donor LT, ischemia time 
could be shortened by timing the operation of the donor to that 
of the recipient. The implanted kidney graft functioned well 
during whole operation, including in the liver reperfusion pe￾riod, and anesthesia was maintained successfully. 
In 2009, Park et al. [5] reported a case of SLKT (deceased 
liver and kidney donor) in a 13-year-old child receiving preop￾erative peritoneal dialysis. Authors found it difficult to place an 
additional large caliber central line in a child, and so did not use 
ioRRT. Instead, they used non-potassium-containing fluid, fresh 
blood products within a week and sodium bicarbonate infusion, 
which resulted in an adequate acid-base and electrolyte balance 
during the operation. Of interest in that case is the fact that the 
authors used non-potassium-containing 0.9% saline during 
SLKT. Recent studies on balanced crystalloids have revealed the 
benefits of low incidence of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis 
and renal vasoconstriction, implicating less kidney injury [6]. In 
addition, a more recent randomized controlled study reported 
that the risk of hyperkalemia in KT recipients receiving acetate￾buffered balanced solution was not significantly higher than in 
KT recipients receiving 0.9% saline, although the former solu￾tion contains potassium [8]. Therefore, in light of this informa￾tion, we changed our primary fluid during LT and KT from 0.9% 
saline to acetate-buffered balanced crystalloid (i.e., Plasma solu￾tion A).
In 2002, Huh et al. [7] reported two cases of SLKT. One in￾volved a deceased donor and the other involved a living donor. 
Authors used ioRRT in the living donor case, and a clot forma￾tion in the filter disabled the system two hours after initiation. 
They replaced the filter, and the system stopped again after 
another two hours. The last period of anesthesia was maintained 
well without ioRRT. Theoretically, ioRRT actually has several 
complications. Above all, ioRRT has a risk of filter clotting. 
Unfortunately, systemic anticoagulation has a risk of increased 
bleeding tendency. It is difficult to stay at an appropriate point 
between pro-coagulation and anti-coagulation in patients with 
end-stage liver disease because they already have a drifting bal￾ance of coagulation. Recently, a regional anticoagulation tech￾nique with circuit inborn citrate was invented as an alternative. 
Other reported complications of ioRRT include hypothermia, 
vascular access dysfunction, fluid and electrolyte balance errors 
and, rarely, mechanical problems. Financial issues should also 
not be ignored, because ioRRT has been reported to consume 
a significant portion of national medical insurance resources in 
Korea.
As a next step, we searched international reference databases 
and found a few studies on the use of ioRRT in LT and SLKT. In 
the early 2000s, there were sporadic case reports and experience 
reports prepared by a single center or authors with a small-sized 
study population, addressing the possibility of better intraopera￾tive management of metabolic and acid-base homeostasis with 
ioRRT. In 2011, Parmar et al. [9] reported a retrospective cohort 
study of ioRRT in 72 LT recipients, and noted that there was no 
difference in post-operative complication rates between ioRRT 
and non-ioRRT groups, despite the fact that the ioRRT group 
had a higher pre-operative disease severity and CRRT ratio. 
However, this report was limited by the failure to incorporate 
matching between the two groups. In 2014, Agopian et al. [10] 
reported a retrospective cohort study of ioRRT in 407 LT and 93 
SLKT recipients who were already receiving preoperative CRRT. 
Among them, 401 patients did not receive ioRRT, 70 patients 
received planned ioRRT, and 29 patients received emergent 
ioRRT. Perioperative variables were analyzed between these 
three groups, and the authors observed similar intraoperative 
complication rates between the planned-ioRRT group and non￾ioRRT group, despite the fact that preoperative disease severity 
variables were significantly worse in the planned-ioRRT group. 
From this, they suggested that these intraoperative outcomes, 
observed to be better than expected in the planned-ioRRT 
group, were in fact due to the utilization of ioRRT. In addition, 
they observed significantly lower intraoperative complica￾tion rates in the planned-ioRRT group than in the emergent￾ioRRT group, despite the fact that preoperative disease severity 
variables were similar in the two groups. From this, the authors 
also suggested that the inferior intraoperative results in the 
emergent-ioRRT group could be due to not initiating ioRRT as a 
planned intervention. 
As was demonstrated, most studies on the use of ioRRT are 
mainly observational or retrospective, and the necessary strong 
evidence does not exist so far. Fortunately, according to clini￾caltrials.gov, the first large multicenter, prospective randomized 
controlled trial is in process by Bagshaw et al., which began in

2012. This study is designed to compare ioRRT during LT with 
standard supportive therapy in patients with a glomerular filtra￾tion rate (GFR) of less than 60 ml/min. The results are prelimi￾nary and the study population is limited to non-pre-transplant 
CRRT patients receiving LT alone; nevertheless, the study may 
become a cornerstone for ioRRT research and may affect the fu￾ture management of high-MELD score recipients in the future.
Simultaneous liver and kidney transplantation
As a last step in this study, we searched literature databases 
for SLKT listing criteria. We realized that almost all of the SLKT 
recipients in Korea, including the patients from our cases, 
showed lower MELD scores as compared with recipients in 
the US. In living donor SLKT, the availability of simultaneous 
donors exerts more leverage on the decision of SLKT than the 
nature of the disease itself. However, even in the deceased do￾nor case (case B), kidney function was enough to filtrate body 
wastes without RRT (SCr 1.58 mg/dl). This may be attributed 
to the current non-existence of SLKT listing criteria in Korea. 
In the US, there are a few consensus guidelines on SLKT listing 
criteria, which have been largely made and revised using Organ 
Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) data. How￾ever, they are, by all means, not perfect and there are still many 
obstacles to be solved. 
First, currently there is no consensus on the definitions of 
AKI and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the setting of LT. It is 
well known that SCr, the classic biomarker, can lead to overes￾timation of the true kidney function in end-stage liver disease 
recipients. However, the feasibility and widespread laboratory 
availability of SCr has made it to form the basis for estimating 
the degree of renal dysfunction, even in LT and SLKT. For now, 
the most notable definition of renal dysfunction is the Risk, 
Injury, Failure, Loss, End-stage kidney disease (RIFLE) 5 stage 
criteria developed in 2004, which was modified to a three-stage 
system by the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) in 2007. 
Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) in 2012 
added a last touch to the RIFLE criteria by formulating albu￾minuria criteria and applying a time frame to the SCr criteria. 
Furthermore, to define renal dysfunction in LT recipients, a 
working party by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI) 
and International Ascites Club in 2011 suggested a proposal to 
apply the RIFLE criteria to define AKI and CKD in patients with 
cirrhosis, irrespective of the cause [11]. New candidates for bio￾markers, such as cystatin C and neutrophil gelatinase-associated 
lipocalin (NGAL), are currently under investigation. A new def￾inition of renal dysfunction made up by those novel biomarkers 
is needed to create an appropriate SLKT listing criteria.
Second, key factors that determine non-recovery of kidney 
function after LT remain poorly defined. Recently, Sharma et al. 
[12] reported a retrospective review analyzing 2,112 adult de￾ceased donor LT recipients who received acute RRT for less than 
90 days before LT. The authors concluded that native renal func￾tion was recovered in the majority of patients within six months 
post-transplant, with the cumulative risk of renal non-recovery 
being 8.9%. According to the study by Sharma et al., risk factors 
of renal non-recovery were age at LT, longer duration of RRT, re￾transplant and pre-LT diabetes. Although it is a good option for 
a patient who has both end-stage liver and kidney disease, SLKT 
should not be performed in patients in whom renal dysfunction 
is expected to disappear after LT. According to literatures, in 
the past decade in the US, more than 30,000 adults were added 
to the KT waiting list annually, but only 55–60% eventually re￾ceived a deceased kidney graft. During that same time period, 
13–15% of the individuals on the waiting list died while waiting 
for a transplant and 3–10% of them were removed from the list 
due to high disease severity. It should be noted that organ short￾age is apparent in Korea, too. Further research on eligible risk 
factors is needed to avoid overzealous listing for SLKT.
Third, the appropriate time to initiate RRT in recipients wait￾ing for SLKT is unknown. In the first national survey of prac￾tice patterns of SLKT in the US by OPTN, 70% of centers used 
dialysis duration as a criterion to determine the need for SLKT, 
whereas 30% of centers used AKI duration [1]. However, there is 
still no guideline regarding when to start RRT in recipients wait￾ing on a list. The decision of when to begin RRT is especially 
difficult to make in cases in which recipients develop AKI. Thus, 
a consensus on this decision is essential to build an acting SLKT 
criteria that embodies all recipients with or without RRT.
Lastly, there are debates regarding the true benefits of SLKT. 
In a review based on OPTN data by Formica et al. [13], recipi￾ents undergoing LT with SCr > 2.5 mg/dl or pre-transplant 
dialysis time of > 2 months have 81.1% one-year survival rate 
and 65.9% five-year survival rate. SLKT increased this outcome 
to only 86.2% and 70.1%, respectively. More recent study data 
based on a propensity score-analysis of OPTN data concluded 
that survival benefit may even be as little as one month at five 
years after transplantation [14]. In addition, transplantation of 
a kidney graft in recipients of LT with a high risk of mortality 
can be a waste of scarce organs. In a single-center study consist￾ing of 169 patients with a MELD score > 40, futile LT outcomes 
(defined as three-month mortality or in-hospital mortality) 
occurred in over 22% of those involved in the study. In another 
analysis using the national database, patients with MELD score 
> 40 were more than twice as likely to die within 30 days of 
transplant than those with MELD scores of less than 30. Accord￾ing to them, futility predictive factors included age > 60 years, 
body mass index > 30 kg/m2
, a pre-transplant requirement for 
ICU care or life support and the presence of multiple comorbidi￾ties [15]. The overall one-year kidney graft survival after SLKT

was 77.2%, while graft survival after KT alone was 89.3%, fol￾lowing OPTN data in a similar study. Thus, the additory benefit 
from SLKT over LT alone should be better estimated and bal￾anced with the disadvantage of patients waiting for KT alone.
Despite all of the limitations above, several consensus guide￾lines for SLKT listing criteria were made and published by 
several researchers as well as associations and government divi￾sions in the US. The most notable ones are those from two big 
consensus conferences by OPTN. The first one was published 
by Eason et al. in 2008 and the second one by Nadim et al. in 
2012 [1]. The latter one adopted and modified the definition of 
AKI and CKD by KDIGO, and consisted of persistent AKI for 
more than four weeks, CKD for three months and metabolic 
diseases that affect both the liver and kidney. Recently, OPTN 
pronounced a new SLKT allocation criteria in 2016 [13]. Those 
criteria are as follows. Metabolic diseases requiring SLKT (for 
example, primary hyperoxaluria), sustained AKI (defined as 
eGFR < 25 ml/min for six consecutive weeks) and/or CKD 
(defined as eGFR < 60 ml/min for > 90 days prior to listing and 
< 30 ml/min at the time of listing). All eGFR values are based 
on a six-variable Modified Diet in Renal Disease formula. The 
guideline in 2016 also incorporated the concept of a “safety net,” 
which means prioritizing the patients who received LT to the 
kidney graft listing, in case of renal non-recovery. It was sug￾gested that the addition of this component may affect the deci￾sion to undergo SLKT by removing the concern that if a patient 
does not receive the SLKT, that they will remain on dialysis and 
suffer a worse outcome.
In summary, we searched reported references to figure out 
the necessity of ioRRT in LT and SLKT. We also searched refer￾ences to make an appropriate decision on the performance of 
SLKT, instead of LT alone. As we discussed above, great chal￾lenges are expected following the adoption of the MELD scoring 
system. It is not just a simple matter of increasing renal dysfunc￾tion; there are bundles of problems to be solved, like a domino 
effect. Utilization of novel biomarkers in LT recipients, the de￾velopment of a more precise formula to detect kidney injury ear￾lier; locating more risk factors on post-LT renal non-recovery; 
analyzing the effects of ioRRT on the renal recovery and deter￾mining the benefits of ioRRT in either living or deceased grafts; 
investigating complication reports of ioRRT; building a national 
statistics of SLKT and ioRRT; estimating the additory benefit 
from SLKT and the disadvantage of patients on KT waiting list; 
and finally, establishing our own consensus criteria for both 
ioRRT and SLKT are all important considerations in the post￾MELD era of LT anesthetic portion of care. Further research is 
needed indeed in next decade.
