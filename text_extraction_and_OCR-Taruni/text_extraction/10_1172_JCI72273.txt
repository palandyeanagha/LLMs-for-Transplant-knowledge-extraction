kidney transplant injury

Improvements in clinical care and immunosuppressive medications have positively affected outcomes following 
kidney transplantation, but graft survival remains suboptimal, with half-lives of approximately 11 years. Late graft 
loss results from a confluence of processes initiated by ischemia-reperfusion injury and compounded by effector 
mechanisms of uncontrolled alloreactive T cells and anti-HLA antibodies. When combined with immunosuppres￾sant toxicity, post-transplant diabetes and hypertension, and recurrent disease, among other factors, the result 
is interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and graft failure. Emerging evidence over the last decade unexpectedly 
identified the complement cascade as a common thread in this process. Complement activation and function 
affects allograft injury at essentially every step. These fundamental new insights, summarized herein, provide the 
foundation for testing the efficacy of various complement antagonists to improve kidney transplant function and 
long-term graft survival.
Introduction
Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for end-stage 
kidney disease. Advances in immunosuppression, HLA matching, 
and improvements in medical care have reduced acute rejection 
rates to less than 10%, but long-term graft survival remains sub￾optimal, as kidney transplant half-lives are only 8 to 11 years (1). 
As a consequence, the extension of allograft survival is one current 
focus of transplant research. An improved understanding of the 
pathophysiology of acute and chronic allograft injury will likely 
guide development and implementation of novel therapies capa￾ble of prolonging kidney transplant survival.
Current concepts are that kidney transplant injury is initiated by 
surgical trauma and the requisite associated ischemia-reperfusion 
(IR) injury, the latter being particularly detrimental in recipients of 
deceased donor allografts. IR rates following transplantation are 
increasing (2), and kidney graft survival is worse in recipients with 
significant IR injury (3). Donor-reactive T cells and anti-HLA anti￾bodies are established mediators of transplant injury and must 
be controlled by appropriate immunosuppression. Inadequate 
immunosuppression predisposes to acute cellular rejection and 
antidonor HLA alloantibody formation, both of which are asso￾ciated with progressive interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy 
(IF/TA) and shortened graft survival (4–6). In contrast, excessive 
immunosuppression not only predisposes to infectious compli￾cations, but is associated with multiple toxicities including direct 
kidney damage (7) and indirect effects of drug-induced diabetes 
(8) and hypertension (9).
Emerging evidence over the past 15 years supports the concept 
that the complement cascade, traditionally considered a compo￾nent of innate immunity, unexpectedly regulates kidney IR injury, 
T cell and humoral alloimmunity that underlie transplant rejec￾tion, and progressive kidney injury that results in late graft failure. 
This body of literature, to be reviewed herein, suggests that comple￾ment components produced by the liver as well as by kidney cells 
and immune cells play crucial roles as pathogenic mediators of 
transplant rejection in animals and humans. The data support the 
need for further efficacy testing of targeting complement and/or 
its receptors to improve kidney transplant outcome in humans.
Overview of the complement cascade
The complement system is composed of over 30 soluble and mem￾brane-bound proteins that are activated as a cascade by three initi￾ating pathways: (a) the lectin pathway triggered by carbohydrates 
present on bacteria surface, (b) the classical pathway triggered by 
cross-linking, cell-bound subclasses of IgG and IgM antibodies, 
and (c) the alternative pathway that undergoes spontaneous acti￾vation on cell surfaces (Figure 1 and ref. 10).
The three pathways converge to form C3 convertases, multim￾eric protein complexes with enzymatic activity (10). Cleavage of 
C3 yields C3a and C3b, the latter of which triggers formation of 
the C5 convertase. Subsequent C5 cleavage initiates formation of 
the membrane attack complex (MAC, C5b-9) on the target cells. In 
addition to the MAC, soluble and surface-bound split products, 
including C3a, C3b, iC3b, C3dg, and C5a, mediate inflammation 
by directly lysing target cells, serving as chemoattractants, func￾tioning as opsonins, and activating innate immune cells such as 
macrophages and neutrophils (11).
Complement activation is tightly regulated (Figure 1) so as 
to prevent bystander damage to self cells (11). This regulation is 
accomplished through the expression of membrane-bound and 
soluble complement–regulating proteins. Decay accelerating fac￾tor (DAF or CD55) is a glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored, mem￾brane-bound complement regulator that accelerates the decay of 
cell surface–assembled C3 convertases. DAF limits downstream 
complement activation and restricts production of the afore￾mentioned cleavage products (12). Notably, DAF only functions 
intrinsically, limiting complement activation on the cell surface 
upon which it is expressed, but not on proximally located patho￾gens, which lack DAF expression. Human CD46 (murine homolog 
Crry), also known as membrane cofactor protein (MCP), has simi￾lar decay-accelerating function, but also exhibits cofactor activity. 
In conjunction with soluble factor I, this membrane-bound regula￾tor inactivates C3b to iC3b, thereby preventing re-formation of the 
C3 convertase. Other examples of complement regulators include

CD59 (protectin), a cell surface–expressed regulator that inhibits 
formation of the MAC at the C9 step; factor H, a soluble comple￾ment regulatory protein that exhibits both decay-accelerating and 
cofactor activity; and CR1, which limits amplification of the com￾plement cascade and MAC formation by inhibiting C3 convertases.
The majority of the complement components circulating in the 
blood (systemic compartment) are produced by the liver. Comple￾ment proteins are also generated by tissue-resident (e.g., tubular 
cells in the kidney, ref. 13) and migratory/immune cells, including 
T cells and APCs (14). Theoretically, non–liver cell–derived com￾plement could activate and function locally without affecting sys￾temic complement activation.
Complement and IR injury
The pathophysiology of post-transplant IR injury and delayed 
graft function (DGF) has been reviewed elsewhere in detail (15). 
Briefly, IR injury results from tissue hypoxia, mitochondrial dam￾age, and ATP depletion, followed by the generation of free oxy￾gen radicals upon reperfusion, which initially damage endothe￾lium. Ensuing inflammation driven by TLR signaling and locally 
secreted cytokines, chemokines, and complement amplify the 
inflammation, resulting in tubular injury and kidney dysfunction.
Early evidence implicating a role for complement in IR injury 
derived from mouse models in which complement deposition and 
loss of membrane-bound complement regulators were described 
during kidney IR injury and overexpression of Crry ameliorated 
IR injury (16, 17). IR injury was later shown to be dampened in 
complement-depleted mice (18, 19) and in C3-deficient (16, 19), 
factor B-deficient (20) or C5-deficient (21) mice, while mice 
deficient in DAF (22) or in Crry and factor H (23, 24) (in which 
restraint on complement activation is lifted) were more suscep￾tible to IR injury. Strikingly, IR injury studies performed in ani￾mals following transplantation of WT or C3-deficient kidneys 
into syngeneic WT or C3-deficient recipients showed that donor 
kidney–derived C3, and not systemic recipient C3, is the predom￾inant mediator of IR injury (25).
Peng et al. (26) used C3a receptor– (C3aR-), C5aR-, and C3aR/
C5aR-deficient mice and models of renal IR injury to demonstrate 
that deficiency of either or both of these receptors protected mice 
from injury. The C3aR/C5aR- and C5aR-deficient mice were most 
protected. Studies performed in BM chimeras showed that the 
absence of C3aR and C5aR on either renal tubular epithelial cells 
or circulating leukocytes attenuated renal IR injury, indicating 
that expression of C3aR and C5aR on both renal cells and circulat￾Figure 1
Schematic representation of the complement cascade. C1q,r,s cross-linking of antibodies activates the classical pathway. Mannose-associated 
serine proteases (MASPs) bind to mannose motifs expressed on bacteria to activate complement via the MBL pathway. Subsequent cleavage 
and assembly of C4 and then C2 form the C4bC2b C3 convertase. C3 spontaneously binds to H2O, forming C3(H2O), which binds to cell sur￾faces and initiates factor B–dependent (fB-dependent) and fD-dependent assembly of the alternative pathway C3 convertase (C3bBb). The 
latter cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b, amplifying complement activation. Addition of a second C3b molecule to either C3 convertase forms the C5 
convertase, which cleaves C5 into C5a and C5b. C5b, in conjunction with C6 to C9, comprises the MAC. C3b functions as an opsonin, whereas 
C3a and C5a have inflammatory and chemotactic properties. DAF (CD55) and MCP (CD46) are cell surface–expressed complement regulators 
that accelerate the decay of all surface-assembled C3 convertases, thereby limiting amplification of the downstream cascade. MCP and fH also 
have cofactor activity: in conjunction with soluble fI, they irreversibly cleave C3b to iC3b, thereby preventing re-formation of the C3 convertase. 
CD59 inhibits formation of the MAC.

ing leukocytes contributes to the pathogenesis of renal IR injury. 
In these studies, protection from injury was associated with less 
cellular infiltration and lower mRNA levels of kidney injury mol￾ecule-1, proinflammatory mediators, and adhesion molecules in 
post-ischemic kidneys. One specific mechanism is that C3a pro￾duced in response to IR injury drives renal tubular epithelial cell 
production of chemokines (27). Together, the animal model data 
support the conclusion that IR injury upregulates production of 
complement components by kidney endothelial and tubular cells 
as well as by infiltrating immune cells. Local activation through 
the alternative pathway yields C3a and C5a, which amplify local 
inflammation and injury through autocrine and paracrine liga￾tions with their receptors expressed on cells in the graft.
A role for complement activation in human IR injury was eval￾uated by de Vries et al. (28). These investigators detected soluble 
C5b-9 following reperfusion of deceased donor but not living 
donor kidneys. Whole genome expression profiling of 53 human 
renal allograft protocol biopsies obtained at implantation con￾firmed significantly higher expression levels of complement genes 
in deceased donor kidneys (29). Extending these findings prior to 
surgical removal of the donor organ, van Werkhoven et al. found 
that brain death initiates systemic complement activation, upreg￾ulates C5aR expression in renal tubular cells (30), and is associated 
with induction of intrarenal inflammatory cytokines. The authors 
hypothesized that complement activation that occurs in the donor 
accounts in part for the poorer outcomes of grafts harvested from 
deceased compared with living donors.
The recognition that complement participates in the pathogene￾sis of post-transplant IR injury has prompted investigators to test 
whether complement inhibitors are effective therapies. An analog 
of the human complement-regulatory protein CD35 (CR1; blocks 
complement activation at the C3 convertase step) has been con￾jugated to a myristoylated peptidyl tail, such that when admin￾istered by intravenous perfusion of the harvested organ ex vivo it 
will self-insert into the lipid bilayer of the EC membranes (31). 
Patel et al. used this approach to show that the reagent was effec￾tive in preventing post-transplant kidney IR injury in a rat model 
(32). The human reagent mirococept (APT070) is currently being 
studied in a clinical trial for prevention of DGF (31). Eculizumab 
(Soliris; Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc.), a humanized anti-C5 mAb 
that is FDA approved to treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobi￾nuria is also being tested for efficacy in preventing post-transplant 
DGF (NCT01403389; NCT01919346).
The aforementioned findings indicating that brain death is asso￾ciated with complement activation in the donor kidney prior to 
organ removal raise the intriguing concept that complement inhi￾bition in the donor could be an effective prophylactic therapy to 
prevent IR injury. Innovative study designs involving randomized 
treatment of organ donors and collaborations between organ pro￾curement agencies and multiple transplant centers will need to be 
developed to test this possibility.
Complement and alloreactive T cells
Complement and effector T cells. Building upon the paradigm-shifting 
observation published in 2002 that WT mice do not reject allog￾rafts from C3-deficient donors (33), work from several groups, 
including ours, uncovered an unexpected role for complement as a 
regulator of T cell immunity. During cognate interactions between 
T cells and APCs, both partners upregulate and secrete alternative 
pathway complement components C3, fB, and fD, as well as the 
common pathway protein C5, and upregulate surface expression 
of C3aR and C5aR (34, 35). These changes are a consequence of 
costimulatory molecule signaling via CD28/CD80/CD86 and 
CD154/CD40 (35), which simultaneously and transiently reduce 
cell surface–expressed DAF (thereby lifting restraint on comple￾ment activation). Locally produced C3a and C5a bind to their 
receptors and function as autocrine and paracrine stimulators of 
the T cell and the APC (34, 35). Signaling via these GPCRs in T cells 
activates PI3Kγ and induces phosphorylation of the intracellular 
signaling molecule AKT (14, 35), upregulating the antiapoptotic 
protein Bcl2 and downregulating expression of the proapoptotic 
molecule Fas. Together, these complement-dependent mechanisms 
enhance T cell proliferation and diminish T cell apoptosis (14). The 
evidence also indicates that C3aR and C5aR signaling is required 
for T cell homeostasis, as T cells deficient in both receptors spon￾taneously undergo accelerated cell death in vitro and in vivo (35).
On DCs and macrophages, C3a/C3aR and C5a/C5aR ligations 
induce upregulation and release of innate cytokines (e.g., IL-12, 
IL-23) and costimulatory molecules (e.g., CD80, CD86) (35–38). 
APCs deficient in C5aR/C3aR or C3 produce less IL-12, express 
lower levels of CD80, and are weaker T cell stimulators than WT 
APCs, while DCs and macrophages obtained from mice genetically 
deficient in DAF produce more IL-12 and induce stronger T cell 
responses than cells from WT animals (35–38). Independent of the 
phenotype of the APC, T cells deficient in C3aR and C5aR signal￾ing respond poorly to WT and Daf1–/– APCs and undergo acceler￾ated cell death (14, 35).
Alloresponses are dampened in WT chimeric mouse recipients 
of C3–/– BM, despite normal serum complement. In contrast, 
C3-deficient chimeric hosts repopulated with WT BM exhibited 
normal T cell alloreactivity (14, 39). Analogously, BM chimeras 
produced using C5aR-deficient donors or recipients confirmed 
that T cell immunity is dependent on C5aR expression on BM￾derived cells (14, 39).
Complement and T cell–mediated rejection. Studies performed in 
transplant models revealed WT mice reject Daf1–/– heart allografts 
with accelerated kinetics (39), and that the accelerated rejection is 
due to a complement-dependent augmentation of antidonor T cell 
immunity. Collaborative work additionally showed that donor or 
recipient DAF deficiency accelerates skin graft rejection (34) and 
overcomes the immune privilege of the eye by enhancing patho￾genic T cell alloimmunity induced by normally tolerogenic corneal 
transplants, resulting in rapid corneal rejection (40).
CD8+ T cells, the principal mediators of solid organ transplant 
rejection, require helper signals derived from CD4+ T cells in 
order to become optimal pathogenic effector cells (CD4-defi￾cient mice do not reject cardiac allografts; ref. 41). Current con￾cepts regarding how CD4+ T cells help alloreactive CD8+ T cells 
are that during cognate TCR/APC interactions, CD154 expressed 
on CD4+ T cells transmits activating signals to APCs through 
ligation with CD40 (42, 43). This in turn upregulates costimula￾tory molecule (CD80/86) and MHC expression on the APC and 
induces proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-12), which together 
facilitate optimal CD8+ T cell activation, expansion, differentia￾tion, and survival. Building upon previous findings linking com￾plement to T cell activation, our research group provided exper￾imental evidence, using in vivo transplant models, that immune 
cell–derived complement is a crucial molecular intermediary 
underlying how CD4 cells provide help to alloreactive CD8+ T 
cells required for rejection (44).

Local complement production also influences effector CD8+
T cell responses to allogeneic vascular ECs (45). Experiments 
performed using in vitro culture systems and in vivo heart trans￾plantation models showed that complement is produced by ECs 
and regulates T cell function and expansion (46). The effects of 
EC-derived complement are transmitted in part through C5aR 
signaling on T cells (45).
C5a/C5aR interactions also modulate T cell–dependent kidney 
transplant rejection in rodents (47). Together with the findings 
that anti-C5 mAb synergizes with CTLA4-Ig to prevent T cell 
priming, limits T cell trafficking to an allograft, and prolongs 
transplant survival in mice (48), the body of work supports the 
conclusion that complement is a physiologically important regu￾lator of pathogenic T cell immunity that causes allograft rejection 
in animal models.
Important confirmatory human experiments published in 2013 
showed that C3a and C5a are generated during in vitro cultures 
of human T cells responding to allogeneic DCs (49). Both part￾ners express the receptors for C3a and C5a (50–53), and C3aR 
and C5aR antagonists inhibit human T cell proliferation (49). 
Recombinant C3a/C5a promote human CD4+ T cell expansion, 
bypassing the inhibitory effects of CTLA4-Ig, and inducing AKT 
phosphorylation. Lowering human DC C3a/C5a production by 
siRNA knockdown of DC-expressed C3 reduces human T cell 
alloresponses. Conversely, downregulating DC expression of DAF 
increases immune cell C3a/C5a and augments human alloreac￾tive T cell proliferation, identifying APCs as the dominant com￾plement source (49). In vitro studies by Zhou et al. also showed 
that different subsets of human DCs produce complement, and 
that C5aR/C3aR signaling regulates DC activation and function 
(54). Pharmacological C5aR blockade reduced human anti-mouse 
graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) scores and inhibited T cell 
responses in NOD/SCID/γcnull mouse recipients of human periph￾eral blood mononuclear cells, verifying that the C5aR-dependent 
effects on human T cells apply in vivo (49).
In further support of the clinical relevance of local complement 
in human transplantation, the quantity of RNA message for alter￾native pathway complement components and complement recep￾tors, including C5aR and C3aR, is higher in human allograft biop￾sies with histologic evidence of rejection compared to non-injured 
control tissue (47, 55).
Complement and Tregs. Tregs are instrumental for tolerance induc￾tion and maintenance (56) in rodents and are associated with 
improved long-term transplant outcomes in humans (56, 57). 
Data published in 2013 indicated that complement also regulates 
Treg induction, function, and stability (58, 59). Our laboratory 
demonstrated that peripheral murine natural Tregs (nTregs) 
express C3aR and C5aR, and that signaling through these recep￾tors inhibits Treg function (60). Genetic and pharmacologic block￾ade of C3aR/C5aR signal transduction in nTregs augments their 
in vitro and in vivo suppressive activity, abrogates autoimmune 
colitis, and prolongs allogeneic skin graft survival. Mechanisms 
involve C3a/C5a-induced phosphorylation of AKT and, as a conse￾quence, phosphorylation of the transcription factor Foxo1, which 
results in lowered nTreg Foxp3 expression. Two additional sets of 
data showed that genetic deficiency or pharmacologic blockade 
of C3aR/C5aR signaling augments murine induced Treg (iTreg) 
generation, stabilizes Foxp3 expression, resists iTreg conversion 
to IFN-γ/TNF-α–producing effector T cells, and as a consequence, 
limits the clinical expression of GVHD (58, 59).
Immune cell–derived complement also modulates human Treg 
generation and function (58, 61). Pharmacologic antagonists to 
human C3aR and C5aR augment in vitro generation and stabil￾ity of human iTreg from naive precursors. In NOD/SCID/γcnull
mouse recipients of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, 
we showed that pharmacologic C5aR blockade enhances human 
iTreg generation and stability and results in better disease protec￾tion (61). These clinically relevant translational findings provide 
proof of concept that C3a/C3aR and C5a/C5aR ligations are viable 
targets for facilitating iTreg-mediated transplant tolerance.
Building upon previously published evidence that coengage￾ment of the TCR and the complement regulator CD46 promote 
regulatory IL-10 production (62), these new results underscore 
the crucial role of complement in modulating the balance between 
pathogenic and protective adaptive T cell responses. Whether com￾plement antagonists can therapeutically control T cell alloreactiv￾ity while simultaneously promoting Treg induction, function, and 
stability in transplant patients remains to be determined. Anti-C5 
mAb and C5aR antagonists are currently being tested in humans 
for other indications, providing opportunities to assess their 
effects on human alloreactive T cells in vivo (NCT01363388).
Complement and antibody-mediated transplant injury
Donor reactive anti-HLA antibodies are generally accepted as 
pathogenic mediators of acute and chronic transplant injury 
(63). It has been known for decades that complement depletion 
impairs antibody production (64). One mechanism involves anti￾gen-bound C3dg (a C3b cleavage product; see Figure 1) binding to 
B cell–expressed complement receptor 2 (CD21), which facilitates 
antigen presentation to B cells and lowers the threshold for B cell 
activation (65, 66). Isotype switching in B cells that results in IgG 
production is dependent upon T follicular helper (TFH) cell/B cell 
interactions (reviewed in ref. 67), transmitted in part by IL-21/
IL-21 receptor, and CD40/CD154, ligations. As outlined above, 
T cell immunity is regulated by locally produced complement, 
indicating that complement could impact antibody production 
indirectly through regulating T cell immunity. To our knowledge, 
there are no data addressing whether complement specifically 
alters induction, function, or stability of TFH cells. Regardless of 
the specific mechanism, C3-deficient mice fail to produce high￾affinity IgG responses against major histocompatibility antigens 
in skin grafts (68), demonstrating the relevance of complement’s 
influence over antibody formation in response to transplant anti￾gens. Whether complement blockade impacts anti-HLA antibody 
formation in human transplant recipients has not been tested.
Once produced, anti-HLA antibodies can bind to donor tissue and 
mediate damage through multiple mechanisms including those that 
are complement dependent (69). An unequivocal role for alloanti￾body-initiated, complement-dependent human kidney transplant 
injury was first documented in the 1969 Terasaki article (70), in which 
the authors showed that patients with serum containing antibody 
capable of inducing complement-dependent donor cell lysis strongly 
predicted hyperacute kidney transplant rejection. The importance of 
complement as an effector mechanism of antibody-initiated allograft 
injury was illustrated by studies using anti-C5 mAb in presensitized 
murine allograft recipients (71). These experiments revealed that 
inhibition of the C5 convertase, in combination with cyclosporine 
and short-term cyclophosphamide treatment, prevented acute rejec￾tion and resulted in prolonged allograft survival despite persistent 
antidonor IgG in the sera and in the graft (71). Extending the ther-

apeutic approach to humans, the anti-human C5 mAb eculizumab 
plus plasma exchange reduced the incidence of antibody-mediated 
rejection in 26 sensitized kidney transplant recipients compared 
with a historical control group of 51 patients treated with a plasma 
exchange–based protocol alone (72). Anti-C5 mAb also successfully 
reversed established antibody-mediated rejection (73). In light of the 
association between anti-HLA antibodies and chronic antibody-medi￾ated graft rejection, ongoing studies are testing the efficacy of eculi￾zumab in preventing graft loss in kidney transplant recipients with 
donor-specific antibodies (NCT01327573).
From a diagnostic/biomarker standpoint, investigators hypothe￾sized that detection of serum anti-HLA antibodies capable of bind￾ing C1q would enhance the prognostic utility of serum alloantibody 
analysis in kidney transplantation (74, 75). The latest iteration of 
the single antigen bead technology currently used for detecting 
anti-HLA antibodies (76) additionally identifies those antibodies 
that bind C1q. A 2013 population-based study of 1,016 kidney 
transplant recipients suggested that, among patients with anti-HLA 
antibodies, those that were C1q+ had the worst graft survival (77).
Colvin and colleagues pioneered the use of C4d staining in graft 
tissue as a diagnostic test for antibody-mediated allograft rejection 
(AMR) (78). C4d is an activation byproduct of classical pathway 
complement activation and its detection in graft tissue is more 
sensitive than detection of immunoglobulin. As a consequence, 
C4d staining has become a valuable tool for diagnosing AMR. 
Importantly, diagnostic sensitivity depends on staining method￾ology and cases of C4d– AMR have been described (79).
Complement and kidney graft injury and fibrosis
Mechanisms of late graft failure are complex and involve immune 
and non-immune mechanisms (80), but late graft loss routinely 
results in pathological evidence of progressive glomerulosclerosis, 
Figure 2
Overview of pathogenic mechanisms linking complement to kidney transplant injury. (A) During cognate interactions between alloreactive T 
cells and APCs, alternative pathway complement components are released and undergo activation, yielding C3a and C5a. Upon binding to their 
respective G protein–coupled receptors, these anaphylatoxins stimulate PKA and induce PI3Kγ-dependent pAKT, together amplifying alloreactive 
Th1 T cell expansion and inhibiting Treg induction, function, and stability, thus facilitating acute and chronic graft rejection. (B) The antigen-bound 
complement degradation product C3dg binds to B cell–expressed CR2, lowering the threshold for B cell activation and antibody production. 
Complement may indirectly enhance antibody production by augmenting T cell help (not shown). Classical pathway–dependent, complement￾mediated effector mechanisms initiated by cross-linking tissue-bound, donor-reactive (IgG) antibodies also contribute to allograft injury. Insertion 
of the MAC into the EC results in EC activation. C3a and C5a mediate chemoattraction and activation of polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells, which, 
through Fc receptors, ligate Fc portions of antibodies bound to endothelium, contributing to injury. (C) IR leads to the production of ROS, which 
in turn promote release of DAMPs, including HMGB1, chemokines, cytokines, and complement components, by ECs and tubular and infiltrating 
cells. Through alternative complement pathway activation, locally generated C3a and C5a contribute to EC and tubular cell activation and injury, 
enhancing inflammation and graft immunogenicity. (D) Locally produced (intragraft) and activated complement contributes to progressive injury 
and fibrosis, in part through stimulating the renin angiotensin system and driving epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

IF/TA, and arteriosclerosis (81, 82). The functional and structural 
changes of chronic renal allograft failure share similarities with 
those observed in other forms of chronic progressive kidney dis￾ease, in which decline of functioning nephron mass has been con￾sidered the key event (83).
Unexpectedly, several pieces of evidence suggest that intragraft 
complement activation contributes to this progressive kidney 
injury. C3–/– kidney isografts transplanted into WT recipients were 
protected from toxin-induced tubular damage, proteinuria, and 
progressive renal failure, despite the presence of abundant circu￾lating C3 (84). Follow-up work showed that C3 is implicated in 
the activation of the renin-angiotensin system and in the epitheli￾al-to-mesenchymal transition (85, 86), supporting the concept that 
synthesis of complement components by renal epithelial cells is one 
critical mediator of tubular damage in proteinuria-associated renal 
disease. As proteinuria is one hallmark of kidney graft dysfunction 
(87), these results raise the possibility that kidney-derived comple￾ment participates in the development of IF/TA after transplant.
Indirect associative evidence linking complement to progressive 
transplant injury derives from studies of complement gene poly￾morphisms and transplant outcomes in humans. Specific C5 poly￾morphisms in both the donor and the recipient have been asso￾ciated with worse late graft function, but interestingly not with 
the risk of acute rejection (88). Although controversial, some addi￾tional evidence suggests that donor kidney expression of a specific 
polymorphic variant of C3 is associated with worse post-trans￾plant outcomes (89, 90). In further support of the concept that 
intragraft complement production modulates progressive kidney 
injury, proteomic studies of kidney allograft tissue by the Salomon 
group demonstrated strong associations between IF/TA and the 
alternative pathway, but not the classical pathway, complement 
components (91). An ongoing study of chronic anti-C5 mAb ther￾apy in kidney transplant recipients (NCT01327573) could poten￾tially provide further insight into the role of complement as a 
mediator of progressive graft dysfunction and IF/TA.
Conclusions
The complement system is now firmly established as a pervasive, 
multifaceted mediator of transplant injury in animal models, 
and studies from multiple groups have largely confirmed that 
these newly recognized mechanisms apply to human transplant 
recipients (Figure 2). This success of translational immunol￾ogy, along with the development of pharmacologic agents that 
block human complement components and receptors (92, 93), 
now allows for testing of the intriguing concept that targeting 
complement in kidney transplant recipients will improve graft
