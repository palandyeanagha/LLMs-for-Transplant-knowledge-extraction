Abstract
Objectives
We examined the long-term effects of everolimus in patients with renal angiomyolipoma
associated with tuberous sclerosis complex or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis.
Methods
Following favorable results from the double-blind core phase of EXIST-2 (NCT00790400),
patients were allowed to receive open-label everolimus (extension phase). Patients initially
randomly assigned to everolimus continued on the same dose; those who were receiving
placebo crossed over to everolimus 10 mg/day. Dose modifications were based on tolerabil￾ity. The primary end point was angiomyolipoma response rate, defined as a 50% reduction
from baseline in the sum volume of target renal angiomyolipomas in the absence of new tar￾get angiomyolipomas, kidney volume increase of >20% from nadir, and angiomyolipoma￾related bleeding grade 2. The key secondary end point was safety.
Results
Of the 112 patients who received 1 dose of everolimus, 58% (95% CI, 48.3% to 67.3%)
achieved angiomyolipoma response. Almost all patients (97%) experienced reduction in
renal lesion volumes at some point during the study period. Median duration of everolimus
exposure was 46.9 months. Sixteen (14.3%) patients experienced angiomyolipoma

progression at some point in the study. No angiomyolipoma-related bleeding or nephrecto￾mies were reported. One patient on everolimus underwent embolization for worsening right
flank pain. Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma lesion response was achieved in 48% of
patients and skin lesion response in 68% of patients. The most common adverse events
suspected to be treatment-related were stomatitis (42%), hypercholesterolemia (30.4%),
acne (25.9%), aphthous stomatitis and nasopharyngitis (each 21.4%). Ten (8.9%) patients
withdrew because of an adverse event. Renal function remained stable, and the frequency
of emergent adverse events generally decreased over time.
Conclusions
Everolimus treatment remained safe and effective over approximately 4 years. The
overall risk/benefit assessment supports the use of everolimus as a viable treatment
option for angiomyolipoma associated with tuberous sclerosis complex or sporadic
lymphangioleiomyomatosis.

Introduction
Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder with a birth incidence of 1 in 6000 and
results in growth of hamartomas in organs such as the brain, kidneys, skin, lungs, eyes, and
heart [1,2]. In the brain, subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) develop in up to 20%
of patients and their growth can potentially lead to ventricular obstruction, acute hydrocepha￾lus, and death [3,4]. Skin lesions of various types including hypopigemented macules, ungual
fibromas, and facial angiofibromas are the most readily visible TSC manifestation with more
than 90% of patients possessing one or more lesions [4].
Angiomyolipomas are the most common renal lesions associated with TSC, occurring in
up to 80% of patients [5–8]. They are also seen in 33%–50% of patients with sporadic lymphan￾gioleiomyomatosis (LAM) [9]. Angiomyolipomas usually manifest as multifocal, bilateral,
asymptomatic disease, but as the lesions exceed 3 to 4 cm, they may become symptomatic [10–
12] and carry an increased risk for aneurysms that can lead to hemorrhage [11,13]. Renal
angiomyolipomas associated with TSC or sporadic LAM (sLAM) exhibit upregulated activity
of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) resulting from mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2
genes [4,14]. The TSC consensus guidelines recommend mTOR inhibitors as first-line therapy
for asymptomatic growing angiomyolipomas measuring >3 cm in diameter, whereas selective
embolization and kidney-sparing resection are acceptable second-line therapies [15]. The
EXIST-2 (EXamining everolimus In a Study of Tuberous sclerosis complex) study demon￾strated superiority of everolimus over placebo in angiomyolipoma response rate, time to
angiomyolipoma progression, and skin lesion response rate in patients with angiomyolipoma
associated with either TSC or sLAM [16,17]. Results from an interim analysis of the open-label
extension phase demonstrated stability of everolimus effects over time [18]. Here we report
data from the end of the EXIST-2 extension phase to evaluate the longer-term efficacy and
safety of everolimus in treating renal angiomyolipoma.

Methods
Study participants
A complete description of study participants, design, and outcomes has been published
[16,18]. In short, patients 18 years of age with a definitive diagnosis of TSC per consensus
criteria or sLAM confirmed by biopsy or chest computed tomography (CT) with 1 angio￾myolipoma measuring 3 cm on longest diameter using CT/magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) were eligible. Patients were excluded if their angiomyolipoma necessitated surgery at
randomization or if they had angiomyolipoma-related bleeding or embolization within 6
months before randomization. Patients who had carbon monoxide diffusion capacity (DLCO)
35%, below-normal oxygen saturation at rest, or oxygen saturation 88% on a 6-minute
walking test (6MWT, with up to 6 L/min of oxygen) were also excluded [16].
The study was reviewed by an independent ethics committee or institutional review board
for each center (see S1 Table for list of committees/review boards), and was conducted in com￾pliance with Good Clinical Practice and under the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.
Informed written consent was obtained from each patient or the patient’s guardian before ran￾domization. The protocol of this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as sup￾porting information (see S1 Protocol and S1 CONSORT Checklist).
Study design and treatment
EXIST-2 was a prospective, double-blind, randomized, parallel group, placebo-controlled,
multicenter phase 3 study of everolimus 10 mg/day versus placebo [16,18]. During the double￾blind core phase, patients were unblinded if they had any evidence of angiomyolipoma pro￾gression, and those receiving placebo were allowed to cross over to receive open-label everoli￾mus. The study was unblinded on September 9, 2011, after a planned interim review showed
everolimus to be highly effective and safe, while patients receiving placebo experienced contin￾ued deterioration [18]. An extension phase ensued in which patients who had been on everoli￾mus during the core phase continued to receive the same dose and those who had been on
placebo were switched to open-label everolimus (10 mg/day) (S1 Fig). Dose reductions to 5
mg/day or 5 mg/every other day were permitted based on safety. The extension phase contin￾ued until 4 years after the last patient was randomly assigned, ensuring patient follow-up of 4
to 5 years. Any patient who discontinued everolimus had a follow-up visit 28 days after the last
dose to assess safety.
This analysis from EXIST-2 presents all data from patients who received everolimus during
either the core or the extension phase of the study up to the data cutoff date of February 4,
2015.
Study outcomes
The primary efficacy outcome was the angiomyolipoma response rate, defined as the propor￾tion of patients with a confirmed angiomyolipoma response (50% reduction in the sum vol￾ume of target renal angiomyolipomas [1 cm in longest diameter] relative to baseline in the
absence of new target angiomyolipomas, kidney volume increase of >20% from nadir [to
account for possible growth in non-target lesions], and angiomyolipoma-related bleeding
grade 2) [16]. Initial response required confirmation by second MRI. All MRI scans were
analyzed in a central institute by independent radiologists. Additional end points included
response duration, time to angiomyolipoma response and progression, proportion of patients
with 30% reduction in angiomyolipoma volume, proportion of patients with angiomyoli￾poma-related surgery, skin lesion response rate (50% improvement on skin lesions, based on

Physicians Global Assessment), SEGA response rate (50% reduction in sum volume of target
SEGA lesions in the absence of new target SEGA lesion with no worsening of nontarget SEGA
lesions and no new or worsening hydrocephalus). Pulmonary function tests were monitored
in patients with LAM. Skin lesion types included in the assessment for skin lesion response
were facial angiofibromas, shagreen patches, periungual or subungual fibromas, hypomelano￾tic macules, and forehead plaques.
Safety assessments included collection of all adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs, with
their severity. AEs were assessed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Termi￾nology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0 [19]. Serious AEs were defined as those that
were fatal or life-threatening, resulted in persistent or signifnicant disability/incapacity, consti￾tuted a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation
of existing hospitalization. Clinically notable AEs, defined as those AEs eliciting specific clini￾cal interest in connection with everolimus, were also reported. Renal function was assessed
using glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which was calculated using the Modification of Diet in
Renal Disease formula [20]. Severe renal impairment was defined as a GFR <30 mL/min/1.73
m2 (chronic kidney disease stage 4).
Statistical analysis
Combined data from the core and extension phases were analyzed for all patients who received
at least one dose of everolimus using an intention-to-treat principle. Descriptive statistics were
used to summarize baseline data and efficacy variables. The best percentage change from base￾line at any time in the sum volume of target angiomyolipomas was represented by a waterfall
plot. A piecewise linear mixed model with repeated measurements was used to link the post￾baseline sum volume of angiomyolipoma lesions to the duration on treatment. The model
included the sum volume of angiomyolipoma lesions at baseline as a covariate and considered
two periods of time: the period in the first 3 months, and the period beyond the first 3 months.
Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed for median duration of angiomyolipoma response.
Summary statistics determined median time to angiomyolipoma response and progression,
with statistics given as point estimates with 95% confidence interval (CI). Exact 95% CIs for
angiomyolipoma, skin lesion, and SEGA responses were obtained from the Clopper-Pearson
method. For median time to angiomyolipoma, skin lesion, and SEGA responses, 95% confi￾dence interval were calculated with the LIFETEST procedure using the method of Brookmeyer
& Crowley, 1982 [21]. Box plots depict GFR and creatinine values over time with mean,
median, and interquartile range indicated. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS soft￾ware (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Baseline characteristics
Overall, 112 patients received at least one dose of everolimus and were included in this analy￾sis: 79 patients originally randomly assigned to everolimus and 33 patients who switched to
open-label everolimus from placebo. At the data cutoff (February 4, 2015), 83 patients (74.1%)
completed the treatment duration as per protocol (Fig 1).
Most (65.2%) patients were women, and their median age was 32.2 years at baseline
(Table 1). More than five target angiomyolipoma lesions at baseline were observed in 59.8% of
patients, and 29.5% of patients had renal angiomyolipoma measuring 8 cm. The median
sum of volumes of target angiomyolipoma lesions was 92.1 (range, 2.8–1611.5) cm3
. More
than one-third of patients (37.5%) had undergone angiomyolipoma-related surgery before

m2
. Fifty patients (44.6%) had 1 target SEGA lesion.
Everolimus exposure
The median time on study was 47.2 (range, 0.9–65.3) months, and the median duration of
everolimus exposure was 46.9 (range, 0.5–63.9) months. The median dose intensity was 8.7
(range, 1.9–19.3) mg/day, and the relative dose intensity (ratio of administered dose to planned
dose) was 0.86. Most (82.1%) patients were exposed to everolimus for 2.8 years, and 12.5%
had exposure for 4.5 years. Ten (8.9%) patients discontinued the study because of AEs.
Approximately 80% of patients required 1 dose interruption and/or reduction; AEs were the
most common reason (66.1% for dose interruptions, 59.8% for dose reductions). At 4 years

into the study, approximately 60% of patients were taking 10 mg/day of everolimus (as per
protocol), approximately 30% of patients were taking between 5 and <10 mg/day of everoli￾mus (mostly 5 mg/day) and 10% to 15% of patients were taking between 0 and <5 mg/day
(mostly 5 mg/every other day) out of the 58 patients who had at least 4 years of exposure to
everolimus in the study.
Renal angiomyolipoma response
Of the 112 patients with 1 target renal angiomyolipoma at baseline, a confirmed response
was achieved in 65 patients (58.0%; 95% CI, 48.3%–67.3%) at any time. The median time to
angiomyolipoma response was 2.89 months (95% CI, 2.79 to 3.19). A best overall result of sta￾ble disease (between <50% reduction in lesion volume from baseline and <25% increase in
volume over nadir) was reported in 34 patients (30.4%; 95% CI, 22.0%–39.8%); one patient
(0.9%; 95% CI, 0.0%–4.9%), experienced disease progression within 18 weeks of the start of
everolimus as a best response. Twelve (10.7%; 95% CI, 5.7%–18.0%) patients were not evalu￾able for response, primarily because of missing baseline kidney volume measurements.
At least one reduction from baseline in the sum of volumes of target angiomyolipoma lesions
was observed in 98 (97%) of 101 evaluable patients at some point in the study (Fig 2). Renal
angiomyolipoma volume reductions of 30% were maintained for 75% of patients at all time
points. The proportion of patients achieving 50% reductions increased over time (Fig 3). The
longitudinal analysis confirmed that longer treatment duration was associated with lower post￾baseline sum volumes of angiomyolipoma lesions, especially within the first 3 months after
treatment was initiated. During the initial 3-month period, a 46% (95% CI, 37%–54%) mean
reduction in the post-baseline sum volumes of angiomyolipoma lesions was estimated. Beyond
this period, three additional months of treatment resulted in a slight reduction of less than 2%
(95% CI, <1%–2%) in the post-baseline sum volumes of angiomyolipoma lesions. Overall,
renal angiomyolipoma progression was observed in 16 (14.3%; 95% CI, 8.4%–22.2%) patients
(Fig 4). Reasons for progression were increased angiomyolipoma size (6 patients) and kidney
enlargement (10 patients); 9 continued the treatment despite disease progression because of a
perceived clinical benefit. Progressive disease was preceded by dose reduction or interruption
in 13 of the 16 patients (81.3%), similar to the reduction/interruption rate in the overall study

reported at any time point in the study in 101 evaluable patients.a a
11 patients were considered “non-evaluable” due to
missing overall angiomyolipoma response status at each radiological assessment. Among the 12 patients with a best overall
response with the status “not evaluable”, only one patient reported at least one radiological assessment with a non-missing
overall angiomyolipoma response status.

population (80.4%, 90/112). Only 2 of the 65 patients who achieved a confirmed angiomyoli￾poma response had disease progression based on their lowest angiomyolipoma volume during
the course of the trial. The duration from the first response to angiomyolipoma progression or
the last available radiologic assessment ranged from 3.0 to 55.5 months.
Skin lesion response
Of the 107 patients with 1 skin lesion at baseline, investigators noted response in 73 patients
(68.2%; 95% CI, 58.5%–76.9%; complete clinical response [n = 1, 0.9%; 95% CI, 0.0%–5.1%]

and partial response of 50% to <100% [n = 72, 67.3%; 95% CI, 57.5%–76.0%]); 29 (27.1%;
95% CI, 19%–36.6%) patients had stable disease. The proportion of responders increased
steadily over time (from 23% [24/103] at week 12 to 70% [39/56] at week 204). The median
time to skin lesion response was 8.41 months (95% CI, 5.59–11.53). None of the 73 responders
experienced progression of skin lesions.
Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma lesion response
Among 50 patients with 1 baseline SEGA lesion measuring 1.0 cm, the response rate was
48% (24/50; 95% CI, 33.7%–62.6%), and 42% of patients (21/50; 95% CI, 28.2%-56.8%)
achieved stable disease (five were not evaluable). Patients experienced gradual decreases in
median SEGA volumes over time (week 12, –35.2%; week 144, –53.3%; and week 240, –
54.4%). More than half the patients had 30% reduction in SEGA volume at all time points,
and the proportion of patients with 50% reduction in SEGA volume increased over time (Fig
5). The median time to SEGA response was 8.31 months (95% CI, 5.55–11.30 months). None
of the 24 SEGA responders experienced SEGA progression during the study.
Changes in pulmonary function
Among 29 patients with LAM who were treated with everolimus, forced expiratory volume in
1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and DLCO decreased slightly over time. The
median percentage change in FEV1 from baseline was –3.45% at week 24, –5.88% at week 96,
and –9.00% at week 192. The median percentage change in FVC was 0% at week 24, –1.25% at
week 96, and –4.29% at week 192. The median percentage change in DLCO was –2.69% at
week 24, –10.19% at week 96, and –10.62% at week 192. In addition, there was an increase in
total lung capacity (median percentage change in TLC: week 24, 0%; week 96, 0.89%; week
192, 7.13%) and residual volume (median percentage change in RV: week 24, 0%; week 96,
3.94%; week 192, 14.29%) over time. Percentage changes and absolute values over time are
provided in Table 2.

Safety outcomes
Most of the reported AEs were of grade 1 or 2 in severity. Individual grade 3 AEs occurred at
a frequency 4.5%, and the most frequently reported that occurred in 2% were decreased
blood phosphorus (laboratory abnormality; 4.5%), hypophosphatemia (per investigator;
2.7%), amenorrhea (3.6%), and epilepsy (2.7%). Individual grade 4 AEs were infrequent; the
most common was blood uric acid increased (2.7%). The most common AEs suspected to be
related to everolimus (20% of the patients) were stomatitis (42%), hypercholesterolemia
(30.4%), acne (25.9%), and aphthous stomatitis and nasopharyngitis (21.4% each). Emer￾gence of individual AEs was generally highest in the first year and decreased each subsequent
year (Table 3). Serious AEs were observed in 37.5% of the patients, most frequently epilepsy
(5.4%) and pneumonia (2.7%). Several AEs that have been previously noted with everolimus
were monitored closely for their clinical impact. Infections were noted in 91.1%. Most

infections involved the upper respiratory tract and were mild to moderate in severity. In
addition to administration of appropriate non-drug therapy and concomitant medication,
infections lead to everolimus dose interruptions or adjustments in 41 patients (36.6%). Sto￾matitis/related events were reported in 73.2% of patients. Hemorrhage-related events (pro￾longed activated partial thromboplastin time, decreased hemoglobin, menorrhagia, epistaxis,
vaginal hemorrhage, international normalized ratio increased, and metrorrhagia) were
reported in 49.1% of patients. Female fertility—related events (including secondary amenor￾rhea) occurred in 47.9% (34 of 71 females between 10 and 55 years of age) of patients, and
31% (22/71) experienced 1 episode of amenorrhea. Three patients reported grade 3 amen￾orrhea suspected to be related to everolimus. Two patients reported amenorrhea events
requiring dose adjustment; none led to study discontinuation. Noninfectious pneumonitis
occurred in two patients (both grade 2).
Note that an adverse event is counted only in the time period in which it started.
None of the treated patients reported angiomyolipoma-related bleeding during the study.
The most common AEs requiring additional therapy included nasopharyngitis and stomatitis
(33% each). One death (status epilepticus) was reported and was not suspected by the investi￾gator to be treatment related.
Renal function
Most patients had GFR 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 or normal serum creatinine values while receiv￾ing treatment with everolimus (92.9% and 83.9%, respectively). Median GFR and serum creati￾nine values remained stable during the everolimus treatment (Fig 6). Severe renal impairment
(postbaseline GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2
) was observed in eight (7.1%) patients. All eight
patients had GFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 at baseline, including three patients with GFR <30
mL/min/1.73 m2 before everolimus initiation. In addition, 8 of 23 patients with GFR <60 mL/
min/1.73 m2 at baseline attained a GFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 while on everolimus,
whereas in 15 patients GFR remained stable or increased. Grade 1 or 2 elevations in serum cre￾atinine were observed in 15.2% of patients, and one patient (0.9%) had a grade 3 elevation in
serum creatinine. Among the 18 patients with grade 1 elevations in serum creatinine, half
reported normal creatinine level at baseline and half reported grade 1 or 2 serum creatinine
increase before starting everolimus. Renal events occurred in 5% (4/79) of everolimus- and
15% (6/39) of placebo-treated patients during the double-blind period (median treatment
duration, 8.8 and 7.8 months, respectively) [16,17] and in 20.5% of the 112 everolimus-treated
patients for this final analysis (treatment duration, 46.9 months). Significant worsening of
existing proteinuria (continuous urine dipstick 2 stages higher than baseline) occurred in
two patients.
Angiomyolipoma-related clinical events
Among the 112 patients who received everolimus, two patients underwent angiomyolipoma￾related interventions. One patient receiving everolimus for 1.5 years underwent embolization
after pain worsened in the right flank (progressive disease). Another patient underwent elec￾tive left partial nephrectomy following everolimus discontinuation (after 3 years of exposure)
in an apparent attempt to use everolimus to reduce tumor burden prior to surgery.
Discussion
This analysis from the conclusion of treatment in EXIST-2 supports the long-term efficacy and
safety of everolimus in patients with renal angiomyolipoma associated with TSC or sLAM.
Renal angiomyolipoma response continued to improve from 41.8% in the core phase (median

exposure, 8.8 months) to 58% in the extension phase (median exposure, 46.9 months) [16].
Clinically relevant renal angiomyolipoma reductions persisted over time as shown by the lon￾gitudinal data analysis which demonstrated an important reduction in the first 3 months of
treatment and a continuous but less marked reduction later on. Low rates of renal angiomyoli￾poma progression were observed.
Over the 4-year duration of everolimus treatment, angiomyolipoma-related complications
or procedural interventions were uncommon, and no treated patient experienced an angio￾myolipoma-associated hemorrhage, whereas one-third of the patients experienced major renal
interventions before entering the trial.
Everolimus was also associated with sustained reductions in SEGA volume and improve￾ment in skin lesions. In the subset of patients with TSC-associated LAM, a lower than expected
rate of decline in pulmonary function was reported. A 12-month, placebo-controlled, double￾blind study in patients with LAM reported an annual decline in FEV1 of 10% in patients taking
placebo (n = 43) [22], whereas the current study reported a decline of 5.9% after nearly 2 years
of everolimus treatment. Together, the evidence supports a multisystem clinical impact of
everolimus on various manifestations of TSC.
The longer-term safety profile of everolimus was consistent with that previously reported in
TSC-associated clinical settings with everolimus [23–26]. AEs occurred in most patients but
were managed by dose adjustment in the majority. After the placebo arm was discontinued, it
was difficult to distinguish between true everolimus side effects and AEs due to TSC (eg, infec￾tions were just as common in the placebo as in the everolimus group in the double-blind phase
[16]). Some AEs, however, were predictable or known effects of mTOR inhibitors, often attrib￾uted to downregulation of cellular turnover (eg, amenorrhea, mouth ulcers). Nearly three￾quarters of the patients completed this long-term study as per protocol. Stomatitis, an event
known to be associated with everolimus, was the most frequent AE. While infections were
common and mostly mild to moderate in severity during the study, it should be noted that
severe life-threatening infections have been reported in patients treated with everolimus for
TSC [27]. The frequency of emergent AEs of all types decreased over time. Renal function
remained stable in most patients, and no angiomyolipoma-related bleeding events were
reported. Immediate surgical intervention with embolization was performed in one patient
(during the study period), and nephrectomy was performed in another (after treatment dis￾continuation). The observation of a single embolization while on everolimus over a median
exposure of approximately 4 years indicates that treatment was successful and suggests a need
for longer-term mTOR inhibition to continue to prevent or slow tumor regrowth, preserve
renal function, and reduce the need for future embolization. This reduction in hemorrhage
frequency could be due to restoration of a more appropriate mTORC1 axis in the TSC mutant
vascular pericytes, thus preventing vascular remodeling and aneurysm formation [28]. Better
angiographic data are required to assess the vascular effects on therapy [10]. Patients included
in this study were at high risk for long-term renal deterioration because most of them had
large, bilateral angiomyolipomas at baseline. Sustained clinical responses to everolimus in
angiomyolipoma and other lesional manifestations of TSC—such as skin lesions, SEGA, and
LAM—support everolimus as a viable treatment option for TSC and its potential to be a dis￾ease-modifying therapy in these patients.
Given the magnitude of effect with everolimus in the primary analysis, maintenance of an
untreated arm was unethical, thus justifying the omission of the placebo arm in the extension
phase. A planned noninterventional follow-up of EXIST-2 will provide longer-term data to
determine angiomyolipoma characterizations for up to 1 year after the discontinuation of
everolimus. Results of EXIST-2 demonstrate that everolimus is a safe and effective longer-term
therapy for patients with renal angiomyolipoma associated with TSC or sLAM not requiring

immediate surgical intervention. Early treatment with everolimus may prevent progressive
damage to renal tissue, reduce renal-related complications and the need for renal intervention,
and improve patient outcomes.
