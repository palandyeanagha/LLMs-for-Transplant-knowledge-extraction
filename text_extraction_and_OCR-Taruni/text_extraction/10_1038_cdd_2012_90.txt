Although TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis inducing ligand) is a well-known apoptosis inducer, we have
previously demonstrated that acidic extracellular pH (pHe) switches TRAIL-induced apoptosis to regulated necrosis
(or necroptosis) in human HT29 colon and HepG2 liver cancer cells. Here, we investigated the role of RIPK1 (receptor interacting
protein kinase 1), RIPK3 and PARP-1 (poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1) in TRAIL-induced necroptosis in vitro and in
concanavalin A (Con A)-induced murine hepatitis. Pretreatment of HT29 or HepG2 with pharmacological inhibitors of RIPK1 or
PARP-1 (Nec-1 or PJ-34, respectively), or transient transfection with siRNAs against RIPK1 or RIPK3, inhibited both TRAIL￾induced necroptosis and PARP-1-dependent intracellular ATP depletion demonstrating that RIPK1 and RIPK3 were involved
upstream of PARP-1 activation and ATP depletion. In the mouse model of Con A-induced hepatitis, where death of mouse
hepatocytes is dependent on TRAIL and NKT (Natural Killer T) cells, PARP-1 activity was positively correlated with liver injury
and hepatitis was prevented both by Nec-1 or PJ-34. These data provide new insights into TRAIL-induced necroptosis with
PARP-1 being active effector downstream of RIPK1/RIPK3 initiators and suggest that pharmacological inhibitors of RIPKs and
PARP-1 could be new treatment options for immune-mediated hepatitis.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis inducing
ligand (TRAIL) is a key inducer of apoptosis in tumor cells1
and a mediator of tumor immune surveillance.2 TRAIL has
also a crucial role in Con A-induced hepatitis.3
TRAIL activates apoptosis by binding to death receptors
DR4 (TRAIL-R1) and DR5 (TRAIL-R2)4 in humans and only to
mDR5 (mTRAIL-R2/mKILLER) in mice.5 Besides apoptosis
induction, TRAIL induces necrosis in Jurkat cells6 or in murine
prostate adenocarcinoma TRAMP-C2 cells.7 More recently,
we have shown that acidic pHe switches TRAIL-induced
apoptosis to RIPK1 (receptor interacting protein kinase 1)-
dependent regulated necrosis in human HT29 colon
adenocarcinoma and human HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cell
lines.8,9 Such an acidic extracellular environment could occur
under some pathological conditions including cancer and
inflammation.10,11
Necrosis has long been considered as an accidental cell
death process until it has been shown that necrosis is also a
well-orchestrated programmed cell death12,13 like apoptosis.
However, there was no consensus on the specific biochemical
changes, as many initiators, modulators or effectors of
necrosis have been described.14 Nonetheless, some specific
molecular mechanisms have been pointed out in PARP-1
(poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1)-mediated necrotic cell
death induced by DNA-damaging agents, called parthanatos,15
and in RIPK1-dependent programmed necrosis induced
by TNF-like cytokines.16 Recently, RIPK3, another RIP
family kinase, has been identified as an essential mediator
for TNF-, FasL- and TRAIL-mediated necroptosis.17–19 This
emerging necrotic pathway in vitro has been shown to be
relevant in vivo in vaccinia virus infection17 and cerulein￾induced pancreatitis.18
The mouse model of immune-mediated liver injury, after
i.v. administration of the T-cell mitogen Con A, results
in fulminant hepatitis.20 Several lines of evidence suggest
that NKT cells are critically involved in Con A-induced
hepatitis,21–23 and that TRAIL expressed by these cells in
the liver is directly responsible for mediating hepatic cell
death.3
Here, we studied the molecular mechanisms involved in
TRAIL-induced necroptosis at acidic pHe and found that
TRAIL induced an early PARP-1-dependent intracellular ATP
depletion, which was dependent on both RIPK1 and RIPK3
demonstrating for the first time an interrelationship between
RIPK1/RIPK3 and PARP-1. We also provided evidence that
Con A-induced hepatitis was a relevant model for TRAIL￾induced necroptosis in vivo, as Nec-1 and PJ-34 protected
mice from this hepatitis.

Results
TRAIL-induced necroptosis at acidic pHe is dependent
on RIPK1 and RIPK3. TRAIL induced apoptosis at pHe 7.4
(B25–30% of apoptotic cells) (Figure 1a, upper panel) with
very low ATP depletion Figure 1b) whereas it induced
regulated necrosis at pHe 6.5 (B70% of necrotic permea￾bilized cells) (Figure 1a, lower panel) with high ATP depletion
(B90%/NT (non-treated cells)) (Figure 1b). As TRAIL￾induced necrosis was significantly inhibited by Nec-1
(Figure 1a, lower panel), a specific inhibitor of RIPK1 kinase
activity, this type of cell death has been designated as
necroptosis in the following text. Moreover, Nec-1 or
geldanamycin (GA) pretreatment led to a switch from
necroptosis to apoptosis at acidic pHe (Figure 1a) with
partial intracellular ATP repletion (Figure 1b). Then, we
studied the role of RIPK1 and RIPK3 in TRAIL-induced
necroptosis at acidic pHe and observed that transient
transfections with siRNA targeting RIPK1 or RIPK3 almost
totally reduced the expression of RIPK1 and RIPK3 in HT29
cells (Figure 1d and Supplementary Figure S1a) and
significantly inhibited both TRAIL-induced necroptosis
(Figure 1c, lower panel) and ATP depletion (Figure 1e).
However, gene knockdown of RIPK1 and RIPK3 did not
achieve complete inhibition of TRAIL-induced necroptosis at
acidic pHe (Figure 1c, lower panel) probably due to
increased RIPK1 and RIPK3 expression upon TRAIL
treatment (data not shown). Moreover, gene knockdown of

RIPK1 and/or RIPK3 led to a switch from TRAIL-induced
necroptosis to apoptosis at acidic pHe with partial restoration
of intracellular ATP level (Figures 1c and e). We then tested
mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from Ripk1  /  and
Ripk3  /  mice with respective littermate WT controls. Both
WT MEFs (MEFs RIPK1 and MEFS RIPK3) were resistant to
TRAIL-induced apoptosis at physiological pHe (Figures 2a
and b, left panels) but were sensitized to TRAIL-induced
necroptosis at acidic pHe (Figures 2a and b, right panels). As
expected, TRAIL-induced necroptosis at acidic pHe was
almost completely inhibited in MEFs RIPK1 KO and MEFs
RIPK3 KO, which do not express RIPK1 or RIPK3,
respectively, (Figure 2c and Supplementary Figure S1b),
confirming a role for both RIPK1 and RIPK3 in TRAIL￾induced necroptosis at acidic pHe.
Interestingly, an acidic pHe sensitized HT29 cells only to
TRAIL-induced cell death but not to FasL or TNF
(Supplementary Figure S2a, right panel), although the pro￾death activities of FasL or TNF in Jurkat or L929 cells were not
impaired, respectively (data not shown). TRAIL-induced cell
death in HT29 cells was inhibited by the use of antagonistic
antibodies directed against DR4 or DR5, but not by an
antagonistic antibody directed against Fas or by a TNF
inhibitor (Supplementary Figure S2b). However, anti-Fas
or TNF inhibitor inhibited FasL-induced cell death in Jurkat
cells or TNF-induced cell death in L929 cells, respectively
(Supplementary Figures S2c and d). Moreover, transient
transfection of HT29 cells with siRNA targeting DR4, DR5,
Fas or TNF-R1 led to a decreased expression of DR4, DR5,
Fas or TNF-R1, respectively (Supplementary Figures S3b
and c), but only reduced expression of DR4 and DR5 inhibited
TRAIL-induced necroptosis at acidic pHe (Supplementary
Figure S3a, right panel). Besides, transient transfection of
Jurkat with siRNA targeting Fas or L929 cells with siRNA
targeting TNF-R1, significantly inhibited FasL-induced cell
death and TNF-induced cell death, respectively (Supplemen￾tary Figures S4a–d). Finally, upon TRAIL treatment at
physiological or acidic pHe, very low concentrations of TNF
were secreted by HT29 cells (Supplementary Figure S4e). All
these data suggested that TRAIL-induced necroptosis at
acidic pHe was only triggered via TRAIL death receptors
(DR4 or DR5) independently of TNF secretion.
RIPK1/RIPK3-dependent PARP-1 activation initiates
TRAIL-induced necroptosis at acidic pHe. PARP-1 activity
was not detected in HT29 cells treated with TRAIL at pHe
7.4 but was increased between 4 and 16 h after TRAIL
treatment at acidic pHe (Figure 3a, upper panel). Protein poly
ADP-ribosylation (PAR), analyzed by western blot, increased
accordingly (Figure 3a, lower panel and Supplementary
Figure S5a). To confirm the role of PARP-1, transient
transfection with siRNA targeting PARP-1 almost totally

reduced PARP-1 expression in HT29 cells (inset Figure 3b
and Supplementary Figure S5b), inhibited TRAIL-induced
ATP depletion (Figure 3b) and necroptosis at acidic pHe
(Figure 3c, lower panel) and switched to TRAIL-induced
apoptosis (Figure 3c, upper panel). Moreover, pretreatment
with PJ-34, a pharmacological inhibitor of PARP-1, switched
from TRAIL-induced necroptosis to apoptosis and partially
restored intracellular ATP levels (Figures 3c and d).
Pretreatment with PJ-34 or gene knockdown of PARP-1 by
RNA interference completely inhibited TRAIL-induced PARP￾1 activation at acidic pHe (Figures 3e and f). Moreover,
pretreatment with GA or Nec-1, or gene knockdown of RIPK1
or RIPK3 by RNA interference inhibited TRAIL-induced
PARP-1 activation at acidic pHe (Figures 3e and f),
suggesting that RIPK1/RIPK3-dependent signaling is
required for PARP-1 activation. In accordance with the
above results obtained with HT29 cells, MEFs PARP-1 KO
cells were more resistant than WT MEFs (MEFs PARP-1) to
TRAIL-induced necroptosis at acidic pHe (Figure 4a, lower
panel). Moreover, TRAIL-induced ATP depletion at acidic
pHe was partially inhibited by pretreatment of MEFs PARP-1
with GA, Nec-1 or PJ-34 (Figure 4b), suggesting a role for
RIPK1 and PARP-1 in TRAIL-induced necroptosis at acidic
pHe. Transient transfection of MEFs PARP-1 with siRNA
targeting PARP-1 decreased PARP-1 expression (Figure 4c
and Supplementary Figure S5c) and rendered these cells
more resistant to TRAIL-induced cell death at acidic pHe
(Figure 4d). Finally, gene knockdown of RIPK1, RIPK3 or
PARP-1 by RNA interference in human HepG2 hepatocarci￾noma cells inhibited TRAIL-induced necroptosis at acidic
pHe and led to a switch from necroptosis to apoptosis with
restoration of intracellular ATP level (Figures 5a and b). All
these data confirmed a role for PARP-1, RIPK1 and RIPK3 in
TRAIL-induced necroptosis at acidic pHe in HT29, MEFs and
HepG2 cells.
ROS production is not involved in TRAIL-induced
necroptosis at acidic pHe. As reactive oxygen species
(ROS) generation has been involved in TNF-induced
necrosis24,25 and as ROS-mediated DNA damage might
contribute to activation of PARP-1, we looked for such a role.
We first measured ROS generation by flow cytometry using

dihydroethidium probe. We observed an important ROS
production (superoxide anion, O2
. ) in HT29 cells, from 12 to
24 h after TRAIL treatment at acidic pHe (Supplementary
Figure S6a). ROS generation 24 h after TRAIL treatment at
acidic pHe or after menadione treatment was inhibited by
several antioxydants (Thiourea, N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) and
TEMPOL) (Supplementary Figures S6b and c). However,
TRAIL-induced necroptosis (Supplementary Figure S7a),
PARP-1 activation (Supplementary Figure S7b) or intracel￾lular ATP depletion (Supplementary Figure S7c) at pHe 6.5
were not inhibited by NAC or TEMPOL, which were able to
inhibit ROS-dependent cell death induced by propionate/
acetate in HT29 cells26 (Supplementary Figures S7d and e).
Altogether, these results suggested that TRAIL-induced
necroptosis at acidic pHe involved a RIPK1/RIPK3-depen￾dent PARP-1 activation pathway independent of ROS
production leading to high ATP depletion.
Con A-induced hepatitis is inhibited by Nec-1 or PJ-34
pretreatment. As CD1d-deficient (CD1d KO) mice have
been shown to be protected from Con A-induced hepatitis
demonstrating a role for NKT cells21–23 and TRAIL has been
shown to have a crucial role in Con A-induced hepatitis,3 we
questioned whether TRAIL-induced necroptosis has a causal
role in this model. Pathological examination of liver tissues
stained with Hematoxylin/Eosin showed that a single injec￾tion of Con A led to a clear liver damage as presented by
large diffused perivascular and parenchymal zones of
necrosis observed at 6 h or 10 h in WT (data not shown)
but not in CD1d KO mice, confirming a role for NKT cells in
Con A-induced hepatitis. These histological findings were
corroborated with biochemical findings showing that levels of
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotrans￾ferase (ALT) were elevated in serum of WT mice but were
very low in serum of CD1d KO mice at 6 and 10 h after Con A
injection (Figure 6a). As TRAIL has been shown to have
a crucial role in Con A-induced hepatitis, we performed
RT-qPCR to determine mRNA levels of TRAIL and its death
receptor DR5 in mouse liver tissues. TRAIL and DR5 mRNA
levels were increased at 6 and/or 10 h after Con A injection in
WT but not in CD1d KO mice (Figure 6b, left and right panels,
respectively).
Besides, the mode of hepatic cell death induced by Con A
was rather necrotic than apoptotic, as a time-dependent
decrease of intracellular LDH level and very low caspase-3
activity were measured in lysates of liver tissues from Con
A-treated WT mice (Figures 6c and d). We also observed an
increased expression of necrotic markers such as HMGB1
and cyclophilin A in lysates of liver tissues from Con A-treated
mice at 6 and 10 h after ConA injection (Figure 6e and
Supplementary Figure S8a). Interestingly, intracellular LDH
levels were preserved in lysates of liver tissues from Con
A-treated CD1d KO mice confirming protection of these mice
against Con A-induced hepatitis (Figure 6c).
Next, we looked for a role of PARP-1. PARP-1 activity was
increased at 6 and 10 h after Con A injection in lysates of liver
tissues from WT mice but not in those from CD1d KO mice
(Figure 7a). Accordingly, PAR residues formation, analyzed
by western blot in lysates of liver tissues, was increased at 6
and 10 h after Con A injection in WT but not in CD1d KO mice
(Figure 7b). The Spearman Rank Correlation analyses to
compare ALT or AST serum levels with PARP-1 activity after
Con A injection in WT mice demonstrated a positive
correlation between these biological markers of hepatic injury
(Spearman r ¼ 0.8166, Po0.001 for AST/PARP-1 and Spear￾man r ¼ 0.7669, Po0.05 for ALT/PARP-1) (Figure 7c).
At last, to investigate the role of RIPK1 and PARP-1 in Con
A-induced hepatitis, WT mice were pretreated with Nec-1, PJ-34
or both inhibitors before Con A injection. Pretreatment with
either Nec-1 or PJ-34 significantly decreased Con A-induced

hepatotoxicity (Figure 8a, see arrows), associated AST/ALT
serum levels (Figure 8b) and PARP activation in lysates from
affected liver tissue (Figure 8c). This suggests a potential role
of RIPK1 and PARP-1 in this type of hepatic injury.
Interestingly, Con A-induced PARP-1 activation (Figure 8c)
and increased PAR residues formation (Figure 8d and
Supplementary Figure S8b) were significantly attenuated in
lysates of liver tissues from mice pretreated with Nec-1,
suggesting that RIPK1 might be involved upstream of PARP-1
activity. In agreement with a hepatic necrotic death, no
proteolytic fragments of caspase-3 (p32-p17 and p10) and
PARP-1 (p116-p84) were detected in lysates of liver tissues
from mice treated with Con A (Figure 8d and Supplementary
Figure S8b). Moreover, the increase in PARP-1 expression in
liver tissues after Con A treatment (Supplementary Figure
S8b) was inhibited by pretreatment with Nec-1 or PJ-34
(Figure 8d). All these data pointed out that Con A-induced
hepatitis is mediated by TRAIL-induced necroptosis driven by
RIPK1. We did not observe any increased protective effect
when both inhibitors were combined (Figures 8b and c).
Moreover, Con A-induced increase in PARP-1 expression and
protein poly ADP-ribosylation were inhibited to the same
extent by either Nec-1 or PJ-34 or the combination
(Figure 8d). Altogether, these data suggest that PARP-1
activation has a significant role in Con A-induced hepatitis and
that RIPK1 and PARP-1 constitute a major cell death signaling
pathway.
Discussion
We reported earlier that TRAIL induces a RIPK1-dependent
necrosis-like cell death pathway at acidic pHe.9 We further
investigated here the underlying molecular mechanisms
involved in this cell death pathway. By using Nec-1, an RIPK1
allosteric inhibitor,27 and RNA interference targeting RIPK1 or
RIPK3, we demonstrated that TRAIL-induced cell death at
acidic pHe can indeed be defined as necroptosis and depends
on both RIPK1 and RIPK3. The role of RIPK1 and RIPK3 was
clearly confirmed in MEFs derived from ripk1 and ripk3
knockout mice, as in both MEFs TRAIL-induced necroptosis

at acidic pHe was completely inhibited in contrast to control
MEFs. Moreover, an acidic pHe sensitized HT29 cells only to
TRAIL-induced cell death but not to TNF or FasL. And only
decreased expression of DR4 or DR5 by RNA interference, or
use of antagonistic antibodies directed against DR4 and DR5,
significantly inhibited TRAIL-induced necroptosis showing
that TRAIL-induced necroptosis at acidic pHe was specific
of the TRAIL death pathway. Although a TNF autocrine
production is implicated in zVAD-fmk-induced necroptosis in
L929 cells,28 it was not involved in TRAIL-induced necroptosis
at acidic pHe, as we observed no inhibition of this cell death
pathway by using a TNF inhibitor and low increased
production of TNF by ELISA.
Although the effector mechanisms of apoptosis are well
defined, little is known about those involved in regulated
necrosis.29 The role of mitochondrial ROS in necrosis has
been previously shown.24 And recent data have demonstrated
that RIPK1 and RIPK3 act upstream mitochondria to regulate
ROS production during regulated necrosis.17,19 However,
ROS are not required for regulated necrosis in all cell types,
particularly in U937, HT29 or Jurkat cells.18,30 Accordingly, we
demonstrated here that TRAIL-induced necroptosis at acidic
pHe was not inhibited in HT29 cells by Thiourea, NAC or
TEMPOL, three antioxidants. However, we found a clear link
between RIPK1/RIPK3 and PARP-1 activation in TRAIL￾induced necroptosis at acidic pHe. PARP-1 has been critically
implicated in the necroptosis induced by TNF in L929 cells31
and more recently in parthanatos.15,32 Our data showed that
PARP-1 activity increased with time during the course of
TRAIL-induced necroptosis and concomitantly resulted in
increased ATP depletion. Indeed, PJ-34, a pharmacological
inhibitor of PARP-1, and RNA interference targeting PARP-1
inhibited TRAIL-induced ATP depletion leading to a switch
from necroptosis to apoptosis at acidic pHe, thus further
supporting an active role of PARP-1 in determining the mode
of death receptor-induced cell death.31 Such a switch was
also observed after Nec-1 or GA pretreatment (Meurette
et al.9 and present data). Our previous and present data are in
agreement with literature reporting that GA induced a switch
from TNF-induced necroptosis to apoptosis.33 Moreover, the
role of PARP-1 in TRAIL-induced necroptosis at acidic pHe
was confirmed in parp-1 KO MEFs, in which cell death was
completely inhibited. In addition, knockdown of PARP-1
mRNA in MEFs rendered these cells more resistant to
TRAIL-induced cell death. Interestingly, Nec-1 and knock￾down of RIPK1 or RIPK3 revealed that TRAIL-induced PARP￾1 activation at acidic pHe was dependent on both RIPK1 and
RIPK3, suggesting that these two kinases most likely act
upstream of PARP-1 and ATP depletion during necroptosis.
Until now, RIPK1 activation leading to mitochondrial dysfunc￾tion has been shown to occur downstream of PARP-1
activation in DNA alkylating agent-induced necrosis,34

Cell Death and Differentiation

and the relationship between this cell death process and
necroptosis remains unclear. More studies are needed to
understand the relationship between RIPK1/RIPK3 and
PARP-1 activation in TRAIL-induced necroptosis at acidic
pHe. It has been suggested that PARP-1 activity may be
regulated by phosphorylation.35 Therefore, it is tempting to
speculate that PARP-1 might be a direct or indirect substrate
for RIPK1- and/or RIPK3-mediated kinase cascade.
Besides, NKT cells and TRAIL have been shown to have a
crucial role in Con A-induced hepatitis and liver damage (large
area of necrosis) was associated with high serum levels of
AST and ALT.3,22 Accordingly, we reported increased TRAIL
mRNA expression levels in the liver of Con A-treated WT mice
but not in Con A-treated CD1d KO mice suggesting that the
increase might be confined to certain immune cells such as
NKT cells. In line with this, we observed increased mDR5
mRNA levels in liver of Con A-treated animals, which could
mediate hepatocyte cell death induced by TRAIL-expressing
NKT cells. Increased expression of HMGB1 and cyclophilin A
in the liver of Con A-treated mice are other evidence in favor of
ongoing necrosis.36,37 Moreover, we demonstrated that Con A
injection activated PARP-1 in the liver of WT mice but not of
CD1d KO mice. In agreement with our in vitro data showing
high PARP-1 activation during TRAIL-induced necroptosis at
acidic pHe, high PARP-1 activity was correlated with liver
damage and high AST/ALT serum levels in WT mice treated
with Con A. Moreover, we observed an increased PARP-1
expression in injured liver tissues suggesting that PARP-1
may serve as a biological marker of Con A-induced hepatitis.
Interestingly, pretreatment of mice with Nec-1 significantly
protected mice from Con A-induced hepatitis by decreasing
serum AST/ALT levels, PARP-1 expression and PARP-1
activation in the liver suggesting a role for RIPK1 upstream of
PARP-1 in necrosis of hepatocytes. This was confirmed by the
protective effect of Nec-1 and PJ-34 on Con A-induced
hepatitis. However, no increased protective effect was shown
when combining both inhibitors.
All these data suggest that Con A-induced hepatitis may be
a relevant in vivo model of TRAIL-induced necroptosis at
acidic pHe, as it involves the TRAIL/mDR5 pathway and the
RIPK1/PARP-1 axis. The role of RIPK3 in Con A-induced
hepatitis remains to be determined. The required acidic
conditions during Con A-induced hepatitis or TRAIL-mediated
necroptosis could be generated by the inflamed liver environ￾ment,38 which could lead to acidification of the extracellular
environment.10
Necrotic death is associated with diverse pathological
conditions, including myocardial infarction, cerebral ischemia,
acute organ failure and infection.16 The in vitro and in vivo
models of TRAIL-induced necroptosis described in this work
may be the basis to identify new modulators or inhibitors.
These drugs would be particularly useful in the treatment of
degenerative diseases where necrotic pathways are involved.
In addition, programmed necrosis could be triggered to induce
cell death in apoptotic/drug-resistant cancers against che￾motherapy to counteract the ‘Achilles heel’ of cancers.39
In this context, in solid tumors with acidic pHe, TRAIL may be
an efficient inducer of necroptosis and the release of damage￾associated molecular pattern molecules and proinflammatory
cytokines may favor the recruitment of immune cells leading
to tumor regression. In conclusion, our findings provide
evidence that TRAIL-induced necroptosis involves RIPK1/
RIPK3-dependent PARP-1 activation.

371C. Apoptotic cells (i.e., with condensed blue chromatin or fragmented blue
nuclei) or necrotic cells (i.e., with non-fragmented red nuclei) were counted in
comparison with total population (n ¼ 300 cells).
Caspase-3 activity assay. Caspase-3 activity was measured by monitoring
fluorescence continuously in a dual luminescence fluorimeter (Spectra max Gemini
XS, Molecular Devices). Briefly, 50–80 mg of cell lysates obtained in a lysis buffer
(50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween, 10%
glycerol, 1 mM DTT) were incubated at 371C in a caspase assay buffer (20 mM
PIPES pH 7.2, 100 mM NaCl, 10% sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 1 mM
dithiothreitol) containing 80 mM of DEVD-AMC (Sigma-Aldrich). Enzyme activities
were determined as initial velocities and expressed as relative intensity/hour.
LDH concentration measurement. LDH concentration was measured
with the CytoTox-One homogenous membrane integrity assay (Promega,
Charbonnie`res, France) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. LDH
concentration was expressed as %/NT.
ATP concentration measurement. ATP concentration was measured
using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit (Promega). Briefly,
cells were seeded in MW96 at a density of 30 000 cells/well. Half an hour
before the end of treatment, cells were allowed to equilibrate to room temperature.
Then, medium was thrown, cells were lysed in the provided buffer and the
luminescent substrate was added. Luminescence was measured in a dual
luminescence fluorimeter (Spectra max Gemini XS). In parallel, cell viability was
determined by a methylene blue assay. ATP concentration was next expressed
as %/NT/cell number.
ELISA. Conditionned media were collected after TRAIL treatment for indicated
times and hTNF (DuoSet ELISA, R&D Systems Europe, Lille, France) was
measured according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Western blot analysis. Immunoblotting analysis was performed as
previously described.9 Revelation was performed by chemiluminescence using
the LAS-3000 analyzer (Fujifilm, Bois-d’Arcy, France). Image processing and
densitometry analyses were performed using Multi Gauge software (Fujifilm).
Cell transfections. HT29, HepG2, Jurkat, L929 and MEFs cells were
transfected by reverse transfection with double-stranded siGenome SMARTpool
siRNAs targeting mRNAs of hRIPK1 (ID ¼ 8737), hRIPK3 (ID ¼ 11 035), hFas/
CD95 (ID ¼ 355), hTNFR1 (ID ¼ 7132), mTNFR1 (ID ¼ 21 937), hPARP-1
(ID ¼ 142), mPARP-1 (ID ¼ 11 545) (ThermoFisher Scientific, Illkirch, France),
or Silencer Select siRNA targeting mRNAs of hDR4 (ID ¼ 8797) and hDR5
(ID ¼ 8795) (Ambion, Applied Biosystems, Courtaboeuf, France). A non-specific
targeting siRNA (siNT1, control siRNA, ThermoFisher Scientific) was used as a
negative control for all experiments.
Cells were seeded in MW96 at a concentration of 20 000 cells/well for cell death
assays and ATP measurement experiments. Per well, 80 nM siRNA and 0,3 ml of
DharmaFECT-4 transfection reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific) were applied in 25 ml
Opti-MEMI (Invitrogen), for HT29, HepG2, L929 and MEFs cells. Then, 100 ml cells/
well was added. For Jurkat cells, 0,3 ml of Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen) and 0.1 ml
of PLUS Reagent (Invitrogen) were used instead of DharmaFECT-4. Following a
72-h transfection period, cells were treated with TRAIL at pHe 7.4 or 6.5, for
indicated times.
Cells were seeded in MW6 at a concentration of 400 000 cells/well for
immunoblotting experiments and PARP-1 activity measurements. Per well, 80 nM
siRNA and 5 ml of DharmaFECT-4 transfection reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific)
were applied in 1 ml Opti-MEMI (Invitrogen), for HT29, HepG2, L929 and MEFs
cells. Then, 1 ml cells/well was added. For Jurkat cells, 5 ml of Lipofectamine LTX
(Invitrogen) and 2.5 ml of PLUS Reagent (Invitrogen) were used instead of
DharmaFECT-4. For immunoblotting, cells were harvested 72 h after transfection.
For PARP-1 activity measurement, following a 72-h transfection period, cells were
treated with TRAIL at pHe 7.4 or 6.5, for 4 h.
RNA extraction and RT-qPCR analysis. Total RNA was extracted from
cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. To measure the relative mRNA levels of mTRAIL and mDR5,
quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed using Power SYBRGreen PCR
(Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies), in conjunction with an ABI7300 real-time
PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Each sample was tested in duplicate in at least
three independent experiments. rRNA 18S was used as the invariant control and
primers efficiency was measured in each plate. The following primer sets were
used. mTRAIL: 50
-CCCTGCTTGCAGGTTAAGAG-30 (forward), 50
-GGCCTAA
GGTCTTTCCATCC-30 (reverse); mDR5: 50
-TGACGGGGAAGAGGAACTGA-30
(forward), 50
-GGCTTTGACCATTTGGATCT-30 (reverse).
PARP-1 activity assay. PARP-1 activity was measured with the PARP
Universal Colorimetric Assay (Trevigen Inc., R&D Systems, Lille, France) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 5  106 cells were lysed in PARP buffer
containing 0.4 M NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 and proteases inhibitors; protein
concentration was determined by Bradford assay and at least 20 mg of protein
were used in triplicate to measure, by a colorimetric assay, the incorporation of
biotinylated PAR onto histone proteins coated in a 96-well plate. PARP-1 activity
was expressed as arbitrary units.
Measurement of intracellular superoxide anion by flow cyto￾metry. Dihydroethidium (DHE, Molecular Probes, Life Technologies) was used
to detect intracellular superoxide anion (O2
. ) production. After treatment, floating
and adherent cells (1  106 cells) were recovered, washed and incubated in PBS
containing 5 mM DHE for 30 min at 371C. Dye oxidation (increase in FL-2
fluorescence) was measured using a FC-500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter).
A positive control was obtained by incubating cells for 1 h with Menadione
(100 mM). Each measurement was conducted on 10 000 cells and analyzed on
CXP Analysis (Beckman Coulter). Superimposition of control and Menadione
histograms allowed defining a gate for calculating the percentage of cells with
accumulated superoxide anion.
Con A-induced hepatitis. Seven to nine-week-old female C57Bl/6 WT
(Janvier, Le Genest St. Isle, France) or CD1d KO mice (provided by Dr. A Lehuen,
Hoˆpital St. Vincent de Paul, INSERM U986, Paris) were treated with a retro-orbital
administration of 20 mg/kg Con A (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in PBS. Mice were killed
at 6 h (WT, n ¼ 6; CD1d KO, n ¼ 7) or 10 h (WT, n ¼ 7; CD1d KO, n ¼ 6)
following treatment. Control mice were treated with vehicle only (PBS) (WT, n ¼ 7;
CD1d KO, n ¼ 6). All mice used were bred in our local house facilities.
For Nec-1 and PJ-34 experiment, C57Bl/6 WT mice were pretreated with i.p.
administration of 10 mg/kg PJ-34 for 1 h, or i.v. administration of 125 mg Nec-1 for
15 min, or with both inhibitors before i.v. administration of 12 mg/kg Con A for 10 h.
At the end of treatment, mice were killed (PBS þ Con A, n ¼ 10; Nec-1 þ Con A,
n ¼ 6; PJ-34 þ Con A, n ¼ 6; PJ-34 þ Nec-1 þ Con A, n ¼ 7). Control mice were
treated with Nec-1 þ PBS (n ¼ 7), PJ-34 þ PBS (n ¼ 7) or PJ-34 þ Nec-1 þ PBS
(n ¼ 7). All animals received human care and all study protocols comply with the
institution’s guidelines.
Fragments of mouse livers were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in
paraffin for Hematoxylin/Eosin staining. Serum AST and ALT were measured in
serum according to the IFCC primary reference procedures and using the Olympus
AU2700 Autoanalyser (Olympus France, Rungis, France).
For liver lysates preparation, 100 mg of liver was homogenized on ice in 650 ml
PARP assay lysis buffer containing 0.4 M NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 and proteases
inhibitors, with an ULTRA-TURRAX homogenizer. Lysates were incubated on ice
with periodic vortexing for 40 min, and then centrifuged at 10 000  g for 10 min at
41C to remove insoluble material. Protein concentration was determined by
Bradford assay before further analysis.
Statistical analyses. Data presented were acquired from a minimum of
three independent experiments. They are expressed as means±S.D. Statistical
analyses for in vitro studies were performed with a Student’s t-test considering the
variances as unequal. For in vivo studies, Mann–Whitney U test was used for
comparison of control group parameters with treatment group and multiple group
analysis was carried out by one-way ANOVA with post Mann–Whitney U test.
The correlation between continuous variables was examined using Spearman’s
rank-order coefficients. All statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad
Prism5 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The significance
is shown as follows: *Po0.05, **Po0.01 and ***Po0.001, TRAIL versus NT. #
