Background: During acute heart transplant rejection, infiltration of lymphocytes and 
monocytes is followed by endothelial injury and eventually myocardial fibrosis. To date, 
no information is available on monocyte–macrophage-related cellular shifts and their 
polarization status during rejection. Here, we aimed to define and correlate monocyte–
macrophage endomyocardial tissue profiles obtained at rejection and time points prior to 
rejection, with corresponding serial blood samples in 25 heart transplant recipients expe￾riencing acute cellular rejection. Additionally, 33 healthy individuals served as control.
Materials and methods: Using histology, immunohistochemistry, confocal laser scan 
microscopy, and digital imaging expression of CD14, CD16, CD56, CD68, CD80, 
and CD163 were explored to define monocyte and macrophage tissue profiles during 
rejection. Fibrosis was investigated using Sirius Red stainings of rejection, non-rejection, 
and 1-year biopsies. Expression of co-stimulatory and migration-related molecules on 
circulating monocytes, and production potential for pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines 
were studied using flow cytometry.
Results: At tissue level, striking CD16+ monocyte infiltration was observed during 
rejection (p < 0.001). Significantly more CD68+CD163+ M2 macrophages were docu￾mented during rejection compared to barely present CD68+CD80+ M1 macrophages. 
Rejection was associated with severe fibrosis in 1-year biopsies (p < 0.001). Irrespective 
of rejection status, decreased frequencies of circulating CD16+ monocytes were found 
in patients compared to healthy individuals. Rejection was reflected by significantly 
increased CD54 and HLA-DR expression on CD16+ monocytes with retained cytokine 
production potential.
Conclusion: CD16+ monocytes and M2 macrophages hallmark the correlates of heart 
transplant acute cellular rejection on tissue level and seem to be associated with fibrosis 
in the long term.

INTRODUCTION
During acute cellular heart transplant rejection, infiltration of 
lymphocytes and monocytes is followed by endothelial injury, 
structural tissue damage, and eventually myocardial fibrosis 
(1). Not only T-cells but also monocyte-/macrophage lineage 
cells are abundantly present in the rejecting heart (2, 3). To date, 
the rejection-related monocyte–macrophage subset profiles in 
both tissue and blood compartment are not yet defined in heart 
transplant recipients. It is also unclear whether rejection-related 
changes of monocyte–macrophage subsets on tissue level are 
reflected in circulation.
Expression of CD14 (LPS co-receptor) and CD16 (Fcγ receptor 
III) define three phenotypically and functionally distinct human 
monocyte subsets: CD14++CD16− (classical), CD14++CD16+
(intermediate), and CD14+CD16++ (non-classical) monocytes 
(4). The CD16+ monocytes are considered pro-inflammatory due 
to production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and 
IL-1β compared to classical monocytes (4, 5). Higher expression 
of HLA-DR, CD86, and CD54 (ICAM-1) distinguish CD16+
monocytes from the classical ones.
Monocytes are important in many inflammatory diseases. 
Coronary artery disease patients have higher numbers of 
monocytes compared to healthy cohorts (6, 7). Local biphasic 
monocyte accumulation was observed following acute myocar￾dial infarction (8, 9). The monocytes, located in the infarct border 
zone during the inflammatory phase after infarction, consisted 
mainly of CD14+CD16− cells, whereas during the proliferative 
phase, the monocytes in the infarct core showed comparable 
percentages of CD14+CD16− and CD14+CD16+. Different 
macrophage populations are also observed following myocardial 
infarction with pro-inflammatory cells early on followed by 
reparative macrophages (9).
Related to the state of activation, macrophages can be function￾ally grouped into two main classes: the M1 (pro-inflammatory) 
and the M2 (anti-inflammatory), although an increasing number 
of different phenotypes with intermediate and contrasting features 
have been described recently (10). Classically, the M1 macrophages 
can be induced after stimulation of monocytes with IFN-γ and 
mainly have phagocytic, anti-microbial, and pro-inflammatory 
functions (11). On the other hand, M2 macrophages are induced 
after monocyte-stimulation with modulating factors such as 
IL-4/IL-13, immune complexes, or glucocorticoids and are phe￾notypically characterized by expression of CD163, CD206, and/
or CD204. These macrophages exert anti-inflammatory functions 
by production of IL-10 and TGF-β (12). M2 macrophages can 
also produce matrix metalloproteinases contributing to extra 
cellular matrix turnover and fibrosis (13).
As different monocyte and macrophage subset phenotypes 
are functionally different in induction and/or maintenance of 
inflammation or fibrosis, it is important to investigate their role 
in relation to heart transplant rejection. This information will 
eventually help identifying key cell types, molecules, and mark￾ers, which can serve as diagnostic biomarkers of rejection, and/
or as targets for rejection treatment. Here, we aimed to define and 
correlate monocyte/macrophage profiles in tissue and circulation 
using endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) obtained at rejection and 
time points prior to rejection, and their corresponding serial 
blood samples in 25 heart transplant recipients experiencing 
acute cellular rejection. Next, we wondered whether these cellular 
shifts were associated with structural graft damage and fibrosis. 
Additionally, blood profiles of non-rejecting heart transplant 
recipients were compared with 33 healthy individuals using a 
cross-sectional approach.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Characteristics
Twenty-five heart transplant recipients underwent protocol 
surveillance biopsies within the first year after transplantation 
at the Erasmus University Medical Center (Rotterdam, The 
Netherlands). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) 
were collected serially in time: at a time point that the protocol 
biopsy showed no rejection, and subsequently at a time point 
of biopsy-proven rejection (median time ± SEM between both 
time points: 3 ±  1.4  weeks). Additionally, biopsies obtained at 
1-year post-rejection were used for Sirius Red staining (median 
time ±  SEM between rejection and post-rejection time points: 
56  ±  12.5  weeks). Of note, no rejection episodes occurred 
between the rejection time point and 1-year post-rejection. 
Histopathological features were scored according to 2011 and 
2005 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation 
guidelines in order to diagnose acute antibody-mediated rejection 
and acute cellular rejection and to grade EMBs as non-rejection 
(0R) or rejection (2R) (14, 15).
All studied endomycardial biospies (n =  50) showed acute 
cellular rejection (2R according to 2005 ISHLT classification 
system) with no signs of histopathologic and immunopathologic 
evidence of acute antibody-mediated rejection. All biopsies were 
C4d negative. Intravascular macrophages and neutrophils as well 
as signs of endothelial injury such as swelling and denudation 
with congestion and/or hemorrhage were absent. No serologic 
evidence of anti-HLA antibodies could be detected using 
Luminex technique.
This study was performed according to the tenets of the 
Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Medical Ethical 
Committee of the Erasmus MC. All patients signed written 
informed consent. Table 1 lists the transplantation characteristics 
and the clinical and immunological features of this cohort. In 
addition, blood samples were collected from 33 healthy individu￾als [age: median +  range: 51 (25–73); male: 42%] and used as 
control.
All patients were treated with horse or rabbit antithymocyte 
globulin (hATG or rATG) as induction therapy in combina￾tion with maintenance calcineurin inhibition (Prograft® or 
Neoral®), mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept®), and steroids; the 
dose schedule was adjusted according to the local standard 
protocol.

collected from whole blood using Ficol gradient. Labeling and 
flow cytometric assessment were performed as described before 
(16, 17). Monocytes were identified based on forward/sideward 
scatter, lack of expression of CD3, CD20, and CD56, and expres￾sion of CD14 and CD16 (Figure 1A).
Intracellular Cytokine Production
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were incubated overnight 
with 10 ng/ml LPS (Sigma-Aldrich) in the presence of GolgiPlug 
(1:1,000, Becton Dickinson) after pre-stimulation with IFN-γ
for 2 h. The cells were then incubated with conjugated primary 
antibodies in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine 
serum albumine for 30 min. The antibodies used were CD3-PE, 
CD14-Pacfic Blue, CD16-PE-Cy7, CD20-PE, and CD56-PE (all 
Biolegend) at 4°C and were incubated with EDTA for 15 min 
followed by incubation with FACS permeabilizing solution 2 
(BD Biosciences) for 15  min. Next, conjugated antibodies to 
TNF-α-Percp-Cy5.5, IFN-γ-APC-Cy7, IL-1β-FITC, IL-6-APC, 
and IL-10-APC and their respective isotype controls (all 
Biolegend) were added to determine intracellular cytokine 
production. The cells were washed and analyzed using flow 
cytometry (FACSCanto II, BD Biosciences) and FACSDiva 
software (16).
Immunohistochemical Staining
Immunohistochemistry was performed by an automated staining 
system (Ventana Benchmark ULTRA, Ventana Medical Systems, 
USA) using horseradish peroxidase with brown chromogen 
(3,3′-diaminobenzidine) as enzymatic label. Tissue sections were 
incubated with antibodies against CD14 (clone 7, mouse-mon￾oclonal IgG2a, 1:100, Leica Biosystems, Newcastle, DE, USA), 
CD16 (clone sc-20052, mouse-monoclonal IgG1, 1:400, Santa 
Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), CD56 (clone 123C3, 
mouse-monoclonal, Ventana, ready to use, Tucson, AZ, USA), 
CD68 (clone KP1, mouse-monoclonal, ready to use, DAKO, 
Carpentaria, CA, USA), CD80 (clone 37711, mouse-monoclonal 
IgG1, 1:50, R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), or CD163 
(clone EDHu-1, mouse-monoclonal, IgG1, 1:400, AbD Serotec, 
Raleigh, NC, USA). Two pathologists independently scored these 
EMBs.
Immunofluorescence Staining
Tissue sections were incubated with primary mouse monoclonal 
CD14 IgG2a antibody overnight at 4°C. Secondary goat anti￾mouse IgG2a Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen) was applied and 
incubated for 1  h at room temperature (RT). After washing 
steps, the second primary antibody mouse-monoclonal CD16 
IgG1 was added for 1 h. Next, the secondary goat-anti-mouse 
IgG1 Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen) was applied for another 1 h 
at RT. Slides were covered with anti-fading mounting medium 
containing DAPI (Vectashield, UK) and stored at 4°C until 
evaluation.
To distinguish CD16 expressing monocytes from the infiltrat￾ing CD16+ NK-cells and CD68+ macrophages, CD14/CD16, 
CD56/CD16, and CD68/CD16 double stainings were performed 
as described above. Double staining with CD68 (1:1,600, clone 
KP1, mouse-monoclonal, DAKO, Carpentaria, CA, USA) 
and CD80 (clone 37711, mouse-monoclonal IgG1, 1:50, R&D 
systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) were used to characterize 
M1-type macrophages. For M2 macrophages, double stainings 
were performed with CD68 and CD163 (clone EDHu-1, mouse￾monoclonal, IgG1, 1:400, AbD Serotec, Raleigh, NC, USA) 
mAbs. Specific controls are used as displayed in Figure S2 in 
Supplementary Material.
Sirius Red Staining
In brief, following deparaffinization slides were rehydrated by 
passage through decreasing ethanol series, 5 min predifferenta￾tion step using 0.2% fosformolybdeen acid followed by 45 min 
incubation with 0.1% Sirius Red solution. Slides were analyzed 
using polarization method. Representative pictures were made 
under polarized light and positive stained area was analyzed by 
the ImageJ software.
Image Analyses and Laser Scanning 
Confocal Microscopy
Endomyocardial biopsy samples were scored using ImageJ IHC 
analysis software (18). Analyses were performed blinded to the 
clinical source using scanned Nanozoomer Digital Pathology files. 
Images of the entire biopsy sample (mean size range: 3.4–3.6 mm) 
were analyzed at 10× objective magnification.
Confocal microscopy was performed using LSM-700 laser 
scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss). The entire biopsy 
samples were scored counting the absolute number of cells as for 
CD16+CD56−, CD16+CD56+, CD16−CD56+, CD14+CD16−, 
CD14+CD16+, or CD14−CD16+ using 40× magnification.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using Graphpad Prism 6. 
Statistical significance was evaluated by Mann–Whitney U test, 
t-test, and one-way ANOVA. A p-value of <0.05 was considered 
statistically significant.

RESULTS
CD16+ Monocytes Are Significantly 
Decreased and CD16− Monocytes Are 
Significantly Increased in Peripheral Blood 
in Heart Transplant Recipients 
Independent of Rejection Status
We first aimed to investigate how the monocyte subset composi￾tion in heart transplant recipients would relate to that of healthy 
individuals. Although the absolute numbers of monocytes were 
similar, the percentages of classical CD14++CD16− monocytes 
[NR: 92% ± 7.5, R: 90% ± 4.5 (median ± IQR)] were significantly 
higher (p < 0.05, p < 0.001), and the percentages of intermediate 
CD14++CD16+ [NR:4% ±  1.5, R:4% ±  3.5 (median ±  IQR)] 
and non-classical CD14+CD16++ monocytes [NR:3%  ±  3.5, 
R:3% ±  3.5 (median ±  IQR)] were significantly lower in heart 
transplant recipients than healthy controls [83%  ±  5.25, 
5.5% ± 3.5, 9% ± 4.75 (median ± IQR)] (p < 0.001) (Figures 1B–
D). Moreover, no subset differences could be detected between 
non-rejection and rejection time points.
Circulating CD3+ T  cell frequencies were significantly 
increased during rejection as compared with non-rejection time 
points which is consistent with previous findings (19) (p < 0.001) 
(Figure S1 in Supplementary Material).
CD16+ Monocytes Are Significantly 
Increased in Rejecting EMBs
Serial EMBs were stained using double immunofluorescence 
labeling with CD14 and CD16. Co-localization and mem￾branous staining of CD14 and CD16 is shown in rejected 
tissue (Figure  1H). Absolute numbers of stained cells were 
counted using 20× magnification field by confocal microscopy. 
Considering the fact that mean surface area of the total biopsies 
ranged between 3.4–3.6 mm2
, there was no need to correct the 
data for the size of biopsies. Absolute numbers of CD14+CD16−
monocytes were significantly higher during rejection com￾pared to non-rejection biopsies (p <  0.05). Although usually 
minor subsets in peripheral blood, both CD14+CD16+ and 
CD14−CD16+ subsets were prominantly increased during 
rejection in tissue compared to the prior non-rejection time 
point (p < 0.001, Figures 1E–G).
To verify whether CD16+ cells were either CD14+
monocyte or CD56+ NK-cell or CD68+ macrophage, double 
immunofluorescence stainings were performed using CD16/
CD56, CD14/CD68, and CD16/CD68 labeling (Figures 2G–I). 
Individual biopsy analyses showed hardly any co-localization 
between CD56 and CD16 staining (Figure 2G). Intra-individual 
analysis of the monocyte subsets showed high numbers of 
CD16+ expressing cells at rejection (Figures 2A–C). Although 
the simultaneously present CD56+ NK cells were very low in 
absolute numbers at rejection compared to non-rejection time 
points, this difference appeared to be statistically significant 
between these two time points (Figure 2D). The absolute num￾bers of infiltrating CD56−CD16+ cells were significantly higher 
compared to CD56+CD16− within rejecting tissue (p < 0.001, 
Figures 2D–F). Similarly, representative confocal images could 
hardly show co-localization between CD14- and CD16-positive 
cells with CD68 surface-expression using CD14/CD68 and 
CD16/CD68 double stainings of all biopsies (Figures  2H–I). 
Based on these data, the CD14−CD16+ tissue pool can be 
considered as monocytes.
Rejection Is Reflected by Increased 
Expression of HLA-DR and CD54 by 
CD16+ Peripheral Blood Monocytes
To compare monocyte subsets at functional level, expression of 
co-stimulatory and migration-related molecules by CD16− and 
CD16+ blood monocyte populations were studied in 10 patients at 
non-rejection and rejection time points. The HLA-DR expression 
level was significantly increased on CD16+ monocytes compared 
with CD16− monocytes at both non-rejection and rejection time 
points (Figure  3A). During rejection, HLA-DR expression by 
CD16+ monocytes was even significantly higher as compared 
to non-rejection time point before. CD16+ monocytes express 
CD54 at a higher degree compared to CD16− monocytes and 
this CD54 expression was, although statistically not significant, 
enhanced during rejection (Figure 3B).
Pro-inflammatory Cytokine Production 
Potential of Monocytes in Heart Transplant 
Recipients Is Preserved and Independent 
of Rejection Status
To explore the cytokine production capacity of monocytes in 10 
heart transplant recipients, we preferred to investigate production 
of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ
and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 by in  vitro experiments 
after LPS stimulation and compared this with healthy individuals 
(Figure  3C) because localizing cytokine expression on tissue 
level is generally considered to be associated with a high rate of 
false positive and false-negative results. The percentage of IFN-γ￾producing cells was higher in healthy individuals compared with 
heart transplant recipients (p: 0.112), whereas the production 

Figure 2 | CD16+ cells in graft tissue are monocytes and accumulate upon rejection. The expression of CD14 and CD16 was analyzed in biopsies at two 
time points; non-rejection (NR; n = 25) and rejection (R; n = 25) and compared intra-individually. The absolute number of cells is depicted for (A) CD14+CD16−, 
(B) CD14+CD16+, and (C) CD14−CD16+. The expression of (D) CD56 was measured using immunohistochemistry, analyzed by ImageJ and depicted as mean 
% positive stained area. The absolute numbers of cells of (E,F) CD56+CD16− and CD56+16+ were determined. A representative overview of rejecting 
endomyocardial tissue stained for (G) CD56 (green) and CD16 (red) at 20× magnification is shown. A representative overview of rejecting endomyocardial tissue 
stained for (H) CD14 (green), (I) CD16 (green) and CD68 (red) at 20× magnification is given (*p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001).

NR and R time points after LPS stimulation (C) (mean ± SEM) (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).

potential of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-10 was similar between 
heart transplant recipients and healthy individuals. These findings 
indicate that, despite the use of potent immunosuppressive drugs 
in heart transplant recipients, monocytes still remain capable of 
cytokine production, oftentimes at a similar level as in healthy 
individuals.
M2 Macrophages Increase in Rejecting 
Endomyocardial Tissue Compared to 
Non-Rejection Time Point
To explore the type of tissue-infiltrating macrophages, CD68, 
CD80, and CD163 expression was tested using immunohisto￾chemistry and quantified using ImageJ analysis. A significantly 
increased presence of CD68+ macrophages was detected in 
rejected tissue compared to non-rejected tissue in both grouped 
and intra-individual analysis (p < 0.001, Figures 4A,D,G,H). To 
investigate whether these macrophages are of M1 or M2 origin, 
adjacent immunohistochemical and double immunofluores￾cence staining were performed using CD68+CD80 (M1) and 
CD68+CD163 (M2) combinations. Confocal microscopy was 
used to show co-localization (Figure  4K). CD80 was hardly 
expressed by CD68+ macrophages in the endomyocardial tissue 
(Figures 4B,E,I). Expression increased, albeit not significantly, 
with rejection, but levels of CD80-expressing cells remained 
low. In contrast, the vast majority of CD68+ macrophages co￾expressed CD163 in biopsies of both rejecting and non-rejecting 
tissue (Figures  4C,F,J,K) showing a significant increase upon 
rejection.
Severe Persistent Fibrosis at Rejection 
Which Is Irreversible over Time
To investigate the association between the detected cellular shifts 
and the degree of fibrosis, the positive Sirius Red stained area at 
non-rejection, rejection, and approximately 1-year post-rejection 
was measured. A significantly increased degree of fibrosis was 
found at rejection compared to non-rejection time point persist￾ing at 1-year post-rejection (p < 0.001: Figure 5B). Fibrosis was 
mainly localized in interstitium and the perivascular areas show￾ing focal collagen accumulation (Figure 5A).
DISCUSSION
Here, we present an in-depth analysis of peripheral blood and 
tissue monocyte/macrophage profiles of 25 heart transplant 
recipients experiencing acute cellular rejection. We found 
contrasting monocyte subset profile in blood and tissue during 
rejection with prominent presence of CD16+ monocytes and M2 
macrophages at the tissue level. Increased classical monocytes and

simultaneously decreased fractions of CD16+ monocytes signify 
the monocyte subset composition in heart transplant recipients 
compared to healthy individuals. No numerical differences were 
noted between rejection and non-rejection conditions. However, 
rejection was reflected by a significantly increased expression of 
HLA-DR and CD54 within the circulating CD16+ monocyte 
pool pointing toward a higher activation grade, antigen presenta￾tion potential, and increased migratory capacity of the activated 
monocytes toward the graft. In line, at tissue level, significantly 
more CD16+ monocytes, especially of CD14-negative phenotype 
were detected. Also, significantly more CD68+CD163+ M2 
macrophages were documented during rejection. CD68+CD80+
M1 subtype remained a minute subset. The finding of signifi￾cantly increased fibrosis at rejection, which was also persistently 
detectable in 1-year biopsies together with the accumulation of 
CD16+ monocytes and M2 macrophages, indicates an associa￾tion between these cellular shifts in induction of the prolonged 
damage to the heart transplant tissue.
On tissue level, we detected significantly higher frequencies 
of CD16+ monocytes in the rejecting heart tissue. We showed 
that CD16+ tissue-infiltrating cells are monocytes as hardly 
co-localization with CD68 and CD56 could be detected ruling 

Figure 6 | A model for contrasting findings between blood and tissue monocyte–macrophage lineage cells during heart transplant rejection. The 
putative scenario of events based on our findings is described in Section “Discussion.” Briefly, step 1: subendothelial migration of monocytes, step 2: migration of 
pro-inflammatory CD16+ monocytes toward the tissue, and step 3: macrophage polarization in to high numbers of anti-inflammatory M2-macropghages 
contributing to remodeling and fibrosis of the damaged heart.

out macrophage or NK cell phenotype as the cell source. M2 
macrophages accumulate increasingly in tissue during rejec￾tion suggesting that the presence of CD16+ monocytes, with 
a presumed pro-inflammatory nature, and anti-inflammatory 
IL-10-producing M2 macrophages are parts of a micro-envi￾ronmental balance within the endomyocardial tissue. Higher 
tissue macrophage frequencies are known to predict worse graft 
outcome (20). Future research is needed to investigate mono￾cyte–macrophage profiles during acute antibody-mediated 
rejection.
In Figure  6, we attempt to visualize a model based on our 
data. It is tempting to think that preferentially CD16+ mono￾cytes will leave circulation and enter the graft at transplantation, 
causing vasculopathy in due time (21). Rejection results in an 
even higher influx of activated CD16+ monocytes producing 
pro-inflammatory cytokines. At the same time, a counterbal￾anced predominance of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages 
contributes to the remodeling and fibrosis of the damaged heart 
tissue (22).
In conclusion, although the numbers of included patients 
in this explorative study are limited, fibrosis is investigated 
by Serius Red stainings and not by cardiac MRI with delayed 
gadolinium pre- and post-rejection, to our knowledge, this is 
the first report on matched serial blood samples and EMBs at 
time points prior to rejection and at rejection. Here, we showed 
that CD16+ monocytes and M2 macrophages hallmark the 
correlates of acute cellular rejection on tissue level and seem 
to be associated with fibrosis after heart transplant rejection in 
the long term. The elucidation of the molecular mechanisms 
underlying these cellular shifts may lead to discovery of new 
molecular biomarkers indicating the immunological graft 
status and may help finding new molecular targets for specific 
immunotherapy.
