Abstract
Background: HBV infection is a serious global heath problem. It is crucial to monitor this disease
more closely with a non-invasive marker in clinical trials. We aimed to evaluate the predictive value
of serum hyaluronate for the presence of extensive liver fibrosis and inflammation.
Methods: 28 healthy volunteers and 65 patients with HBeAg negative chronic hepatitis B were
enrolled. Liver biopsies scored according to Ishak system. Association of serum hyaloronate with
liver fibrosis and inflammation were assessed, and cut off points for serum hyaluronate levels were
identified by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves and their values for prediction of
fibrosis and inflammation were assessed.
Results: In patients with CHB serum hyaluronate had the most significant correlation and
predictive values for the liver fibrosis and inflammation comparing to the other variables. At the
cut off point of 126.4 ngm/ml it could discriminate extensive fibrosis from milder ones with
sensitivity of 90.9% and specificity of 98.1%. With the same value it could discriminate extensive
inflammation from their milder counterparts with sensitivity of 63.6% and specificity of 92.6%.
Conclusion: Serum hyaluronate was the best predictor of extensive liver fibrosis and inflammation
and it could discriminate subgroups of patients with chronic hepatitis B. It could be used as a non￾invasive test to monitor these patients more closely with developing anti viral agents in clinical
trials.

[1,2]. Chronic HBV infection is the major cause of end
stage liver disease, 25% of them will die prematurely of
liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma [3]. It is crucial
to monitor the course of this disease more closely, espe￾cially with developing antiviral agents in clinical trials [4].
Liver biopsy is currently considered the gold standard for
evaluation of liver fibrosis [5]. However it has several lim￾itations like sampling error, post biopsy pain and death
[6-9]. It is expensive procedure and could be exceedingly
dangerous in cases of advanced liver disease with pro￾longed prothrombin time and low platelet count [10].
Liver function tests are essential parts of assessing liver
damage, but have poor correlation with histology [11-13].
Because of limitations in conventional approaches, sev￾eral non invasive tests have been developed for this pur￾pose. Among them, serum hyaluronate as a direct marker
of liver fibrosis appears to be the most promising one [14-
17]. The studies have shown that hyaluronic acid increase
in acute liver failure [18], primary billiary cirrhosis [19],
alcoholic liver disease [20] and chronic hepatitis C [15].
Most of those studies have been performed in patients
with chronic hepatitis C. The value of such markers in
patients with in chronic hepatitis B remained unclear. We
aimed to find out the utility of serum hyaluronate to eval￾uate the presence of extensive liver fibrosis and inflamma￾tion in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Methods
Study population
Population groups under study consist of 28 normal vol￾unteers, 65 patients with HBeAg negative chronic hepati￾tis B. We defined chronic hepatitis B as subjects who met
at least two of three following criteria: 1) serum level of
aminotransferases above 1.5–10 times of upper limit of
normal. 2) total score of 4 or more according to Ishak
(modified HAI) scoring system, and 3) viral DNA load of
more than 1.77 pg/ml (equivalent to 500,000 copies/ml)
using a signal amplification technique (Naxcor assay).
Patients of chronic hepatitis B were selected from an open
labelled Lamivudine trial from January 2001 to January
2004. All patients with chronic hepatitis B were negative
for HBe antigen. They were all negative for HDV Ab, HCV
Ab and HIV Ab. None of them had any evidence for
decompensated cirrhosis or any other cause for chronic
liver disease. Control group were selected from healthy
volunteers. Five ml of peripheral of blood was taken from
each patient in fasting state, one hour before performing
liver biopsy and in complete rest. serum was isolated and
kept at -70 degrees centigrade for measurement of serum
hyaluronate. The same procedure was applied for normal
volunteers.
Assessment of liver histology
Liver biopsy was performed by automatic true cut biopsy
needle. Length and width of each sample were at least 10
mm and 1.4 mm respectively and contained 4 or more
portal spaces. The liver histology was scored according to
Ishak (modified HAI) scoring system [21]. Maximum
grade (inflammation) was scored 18, and maximum stage
(fibrosis) was scored 6. Stage 3 or more was considered as
significant fibrosis, and stage 5 or 6 was considered as cir￾rhosis. All biopsies were reviewed by a single pathologist
who was unaware of patients' clinical records.
Measurement of hyaluronic acid
Hyaluronic acid test kit was provided by Corgenix Inc.
(Colorado, USA, under licence of Chugai diagnostic sci￾ence Co.). Serum hyaluronate was measured by ELISA
according to instruction manual of manufacturer. All sam￾ples used in duplicate. Briefly 100 µl of serum or reference
solution (diluted 1:10) was added to each HABP
(hyaluronic acid binding protein) coated micro well,
incubated for 60 minutes, after washing 100 µl HRP-con￾jugated-HABP solution was added and incubated for 30
minutes. Eventually 100 µl of stopping solution (0.36 N
sulphuric acid) was added. Optical density (OD) was read
at 450 nm. Water was used as zero blank. Standard curve
was produced by using ODs of 50,100, 200, 500, and 800
ng/ml of reference solution. Linear regression equation of
standard solutions was produced. Values of all samples
were computed on the basis of regression equation of
standard solutions.
Statistical considerations
Statistical analyses were performed by using the SPSS, ver￾sion 10.1, software package (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). Data
are reported as means ± standard deviation (SD). Patients
with CHB were arbitrary divided into subgroups accord￾ing to the degrees of fibrosis (stage 2 or less vs stage 3 or
more) and inflammation (grade 0–8 vs grade 9 or more).
The associations between factors (age, AST, ALT, alkaline
phosphatase, platelet count, albumin, total bilirubin, pro￾thrombin time (PT), and serum hyaluronate) with liver
fibrosis or inflammation were assessed by Spearman cor￾relation test. Then, independent factors associated with
extensive fibrosis or inflammation were assessed by the
regression analysis. Subsequently, the sensitivity, specifi￾city, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predic￾tive value (NPV) of hyaluronate to differentiate between
subgroups of patients with chronic hepatitis was calcu￾lated using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve
with different cut-off points. P values less than 0.05 were
considered statistically significant.
Results
Twenty eight normal volunteers consist of 17 male and 11
female with the mean age of 32.0 ± 5.2 (range: 20–44)

years old. Sixty five patients with chronic hepatitis B, con￾sist of 54 male and 11 female with the mean age of 39.8 ±
12.3 (range: 18 – 76) years old. All of them had HBeAg
negative CHB. Fifty four out of 65 patients with chronic
hepatitis B had mild fibrosis (stage 0–2) and 11 (17%)
had extensive fibrosis (stage 3–5).
Serum hyaluronate levels of the populations under study
were shown in table 1. Normal volunteers had mean ± SD
of serum hyaluronate level of 20.4 ± 15.4 ng/ml. The
upper limit of normal (as defined by the 95th percentile of
the variable) in the normal volunteers was 58.6 ng/ml.
Patients with chronic hepatitis B as a single group had
higher serum hyaluronate level than normal volunteers
(73.4 ± 124.8 vs 20.4 ± 15.5 ng/ml respectively; P =
0.002). Serum hyaluronate level of cases with extensive
fibrosis was significantly higher than those with mild
fibrosis (309.7 ± 143.5 vs 24.7 ± 31.9 respectively; p <
0.001).
Fifty four out of 65 of CHB patients with mild inflamma￾tion (grade 0–8) had hyaluronate level of 39.6 ± 74.2
ngm/ml, while eleven of them with severe inflammation
(grade = 9) had serum hyaluronate level of 236.5 ± 188.7
ngm/ml (p = 0.006) (Table 1).
Correlation of the variables with the level of fibrosis, and
inflammation were assessed by Spearman correlation test.
Serum hyaluronate had the most significant correlation
with the level of fibrosis comparing to the other variables
(Correlation coefficient = 0.58, p < 0.001) (Figure 1).
Next to that was correlation of serum hyaluronate to the
level of inflammation which was highly significant com￾paring to the remaining variables (correlation coefficient
= 0.42, p < 0.001). (Table 2).
Logistic regression analysis was carried out to find the
independent variables associated with extensive liver
fibrosis and inflammation in two separate analyses. Stage
and grade were selected as dependent factor and other var￾iables (age, hyaluronic acid, AST, ALT, alkaline phos￾phatase, platelet count, albumin, total billirubin and PT)
as independent factors. Serum hyaluronate was the only
independent factor associated with extensive liver fibrosis
(P = 0.005), and inflammation (P < 0.001) in patients
with chronic hepatitis B.
The ability of serum hyaluronate as a non-invasive test to
discriminate levels of fibrosis and inflammation was
assessed by ROC curve. Within the subgroups of chronic
hepatitis B, serum hyaluronate at the cut-off point of
126.4 ngm/ml could discriminate mild (stage 0–2) from
extensive fibrosis (stage 3–5) with an area under ROC
curve (AUC) of 0.98, sensitivity of 90.9%, specificity of
98.1%, PPV of 90.9% and NPV of 98.1% (Figure 2). On

the same basis serum hyaluronate could differentiate mild
(grade 0–8) from extensive inflammation (grade ≥ 9) with
an AUC of 0.86, the sensitivity of 63.6%, specificity of
92.6%, PPV of 63.6% and NPV of 92.6% (Figure 3).
Discussion
In this study we have shown that::1) Sub groups of
patients with HBeAg negative chronic hepatitis B who had
extensive fibrosis and inflammation had also high serum
hyaluronate level. The differences were statistically signif￾icant comparing to normal values and to the patients with
milder liver involvement. 2) Serum hyaluronate had more
significant correlation with severity of liver fibrosis and
inflammation amongst the other variables. 3) In the
regression analysis serum hyaluronate had best predictive
value for liver fibrosis and inflammation in patients with
chronic hepatitis B. 4) At cut-off point of 126.4 ngm/ml it
could differentiates extensive fibrosis from milder ones
with sensitivity of 90.9% and specificity of 98.1%. At the
same cut-off point, it could differentiate extensive
inflammation from milder ones with sensitivity of 63.6%
and specificity of 92.6%.
Liver biopsy is the method of choice in evaluating fibrosis
and inflammation in patients with parenchymal liver dis￾ease [5,17], but it has several limitations which include
false negative result of 24% especially in macro nodular
cirrhosis [6,7], post biopsy pain and discomfort [9], high
cost [10], and death rate of 0.015% [8]. In the past decade,
several investigators focused on developing non-invasive
test for liver fibrosis [16,17,22]. None of them proved to
be perfect. Guechot et al showed that hyaluronate had bet￾ter correlation to the degrees of fibrosis than PIIIP in
chronic liver disease [23]. In the study by Oberti et al,
serum hyaluronate level was considered the most sensi￾tive test for screening in viral hepatitis B, and C [14].
Imbert-Bismuth et al suggested that, by fibro test 50% of

liver biopsies could be avoided in patient with chronic
hepatitis C [24]. However fibro test was reanalysed in
treated hepatitis C, but its complex equation will limit its
usefulness in clinical practice [25]. Thus, due to expense
and complexity of Fibrotest-Actitest, it could not be uti￾lized on routine basis in developing countries. Myers et al
used Fibrotest and Actitest to decriminate.mild from
extensive fibrosis and inflammation in patients with
chronic hepatitis B [26]. In Spite of the interesting results,
it is difficult to compare it with our data. However,
hyaluronic acid may have a lower sensitivity for minimal
fibrosis (as in chronic hepatitis C) as well as an absence of
independent assessment of both fibrosis and activity as
given by FibroTest-Actitest. We were looking for a direct
marker of fibrogenesis to be cheap, reproducible and sim￾ple. The price of hyaluronic acid test is about 10 US Dol￾lars in Iran as well as in Europe. In this regard serum
hyaluronate appears to be an appropriate choice.
Hyaluronate is a polysaccharide with molecular weight
ranging from 4 × 103 to 8 × 106 Daltons. It forms constit￾uent of extracellular matrix in all connective tissues [27-
29]. It is mainly produced by mesenchymal cells and
cleared by hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells through a
high affinity receptor (Kid = 6 × 10-11 M) with a maximum
capacity of 104 molecules/cells [30-33] It has short half
life and increases by age [18].
Alcohol, viruses, auto immune diseases, and inborn errors
of metabolism could increase production of hyaluronate
by activating hepatic stellate cells and decrease clearance
by hepatic sinusoidal capilarization [34]. Sinusoidal capi￾larization could be associated with shunting of blood
which is an additional factor for increase of serum hyalur￾onate in this condition [35]. It was shown that serum
hyaluronate increase in alcoholic liver disease [5,20,35],
primary billiary cirrhosis [19] and in patients with hepati￾tis C [12,36]. In addition, it could be increased in
rheumatoid disease due to overproduction by synovial
cells [34,38]. It also increases in renal failure because of
disturbed clearance of low molecular weight hyaluronate
by the kidneys [39].
Aetiology of liver damage in our patients was only HBV
infection. None of them had received any alcohol in their
life time. None of them had any evidence for renal failure
or any other disease which could explain their liver dis￾ease except HBV. Bloods were taken in complete physical
rest and fasting state in order to rule out other interfering
factors like eating and physical activity. Our normal level
was 20.4 ± 15.5 ngm/ml which is in agreement with man￾ufacturer levels (28.5 ± 24) and what we reported by the
other investigators with the same age groups
[15,16,20,40].
The proposed cut-off points in different studies were not
the same. The cut-off point will depend on the aetiology
of liver disease and on the level of sensitivity and specifi￾city that an investigator is looking for [14,15,23]. Our
study showed that the cut-off point of 126.4 ngm/ml
could differential extensive fibrosis from milder ones with
sensitivity of 90.9% and specificity of 98.1% and at the
same level could differentiate extensive inflammation
from milder ones with sensitivity of 63.6% and specificity
of 92.6% in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Also, it
should be noted that the cut-off value for a given variable
depends upon the sample in which it has been identified.
In order to be reproducible, a cut-off value should be
obtained in a sample representative of the population
with the disease.
Interestingly enough our results showed that, serum
hyaluronate had best predictive value for the fibrosis and
inflammation comparing to the other variables. This is in
agreement with report of Ding H et al in which serum
hyaluronate reflect both inflammation and fibrosis in
HBV infection [41]. Currently it is believed that serum
hyaluronate is a marker of liver fibrosis rather than
inflammation. To what extent increased level of hyaluro￾nate is due to inflammation alone without fibrosis, is dif￾ficult question to answer at the moment. It is because of
complex interrelation of fibrogenesis and inflammatory
process in vivo, which makes separation of pure fibrosis
and inflammation impossible in a clinical setting. Eluci￾dation of this complex issue requires further work. As
stated above, regression analysis showed that only serum
hyaluronate was associated with significant liver fibrosis.
It should not be misinterpreted that other important fac￾tors (e.g. age, serum albumin, etc) are not associated with
liver fibrosis in CHB. Since, the association of such a pow￾erful factor (e.g. serum hyaluronate) was so close to the
outcome (liver fibrosis) that the effects of other factors
were excluded from the regression model.
Our study has some limitations. First and the most impor￾tant limitation is that our study is considered a training
study, and our data should be validated in another set of
patients with chronic hepatitis B. Secondly, number of
our patients with extensive fibrosis was relatively small.
Further works are underway to validate this test, and also
to find out other markers of liver fibrosis and inflamma￾tion in patients infected with hepatitis B virus.
Conclusion
In conclusion our data indicated that serum hyaluronate
had significant correlation and predictive value for the
presence of significant liver fibrosis and inflammation
comparing to the other variables. In addition it was able
to discriminate extensive fibrosis and inflammation from
their milder counterparts in patients with HBeAg negative

We think serum hyaluronate is a useful non-invasive test
to monitor these patients more frequently in clinical
trials.
