Bile acids are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver, excreted with bile into the
duodenum, almost completely taken up again in the distal ileum and finally returned
to the liver with portal blood in a process termed enterohepatic circulation. Bile acid
synthesis, excretion, and reuptake are tightly regulated. The apical sodium-dependent
bile acid transporter [ASBT; also known as ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT) and
SLC10A2] is pivotal for the almost complete reabsorption of conjugated bile acids in
the ileum. Dysfunctional IBAT may be the cause of bile acid diarrhea. Pharmacological
IBAT inhibition results in an increased bile acid load in the colon and subsequently a
lower bile acid pool, which is associated with improved liver histology in animal models
of cholestatic liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In humans, IBAT
inhibitors have been tested in clinical trials with widely different indications: in patients
with idiopathic chronic constipation, an increased number of bowel movements was
observed. In adult and pediatric cholestatic liver diseases with pruritus, various IBAT
inhibitors showed potential to improve itching. Adverse events of IBAT inhibitors, based
on their mode of action, are abdominal pain and diarrhea which might patients to
withdraw from study medications. So far, no data are available of a study of IBAT
inhibitors in patients with NASH. In this review we summarize the preclinical and most
recent clinical studies with various IBAT inhibitors and discuss the difficulties that should
be addressed in future studies.

ENTEROHEPATIC CIRCULATION AND FEEDBACK CONTROL
OF SYNTHESIS OF BILE ACIDS
Bile acids (BAs) are amphipathic molecules that are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver
(Figure 1) (de Aguiar Vallim et al., 2013; Molinaro et al., 2018). Their primary function is to
solubilize lipids into micelles, aiding digestion and absorption of fat. Once synthesized, they
are conjugated with glycine or taurine and then excreted with bile into the small bowel from
where about 95% are reabsorbed in the terminal ileum via the apical sodium-dependent bile salt
transporter [ASBT, SLC10A2, also known as ileal BA transporter (IBAT)] (Dawson et al., 2003)
and recirculated via the portal vein to the liver where they are taken up by the sodium-dependent

taurocholate co-transporting peptide (NTCP, SLC10A1) (de
Aguiar Vallim et al., 2013). This so-called enterohepatic
circulation of BAs is shown in Figure 2. Of note, the related
membrane proteins ASBT and NTCP preferentially transport
conjugated BAs whereas unconjugated BAs may diffuse through
the bowel mucosa and are taken up into the liver with the help of
organic anion transporters.
The rate-limiting enzyme of BA synthesis, CYP7A1, is
controlled by two different negative feedback pathways that
are both regulated by binding of BAs to its nuclear receptor,
farnesoid X receptor (FXR): (i) within the liver via the nuclear
receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP) and (ii) from the
ileum via fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19), which circulates
to the liver in portal blood, binds to the heterodimer FGF4-
receptor/β-klotho, and triggers a signaling cascade to inhibit
CYP7A1 (Figure 2). When ileal reuptake of BAs is functionally
impaired or pharmacologically blocked with an IBAT inhibitor,
circulating BAs decrease and fecal BA excretion increases.
Decreased BA activation of ileal FXR results in reduced formation
of FGF19 and, in turn, increased BA synthesis, as reflected by
increased levels of the serum BA precursor C4 (7α-hydroxy￾4-cholesten-3-one). Enhanced conversion of cholesterol to BA
results is compensated both by increased de novo biosynthesis
and increased hepatic expression of low-density lipoprotein
(LDL) receptor, which results in lowered circulating LDL
cholesterol (Figure 2). The opposite biochemical changes, and
decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol probably
due to decreased apolipoprotein (apo) A1 and increased
scavenger receptor-B1 (SR-B1) expression, are observed by
the administration of FXR activators such as obeticholic acid,
which is a semisynthetic BA derivative (Nevens et al., 2016;
Pencek et al., 2016). Of note, other semisynthetic BA derivatives
were in rodents found to act on xenobiotic transporters such
as multidrug-resistance protein (MRP) 3 (Al-Salami et al.,
2008).
Because the ASBT inhibitors that are currently being tested
have negligible systemic effects (i.e., they do not appear to affect
ASBT expressed elsewhere, in particular in the biliary tree), we
will use the term IBAT inhibitor in this review to refer to these
ASBT inhibitors.
PHASE I CLINICAL TRIALS WITH IBAT
INHIBITORS
The mode of action of IBAT inhibitors has been demonstrated in
three randomized double-blind placebo-controlled phase 1 trials.
The first study used the IBAT inhibitor A4250 and included 40
and 24 healthy individuals, respectively, that were administered a
single dose of A4250 (dose range: 0.1–10 mg) or A4250 for 1 week
(1 or 3 mg once daily or 1.5 mg twice daily). A4250 decreased
circulating FGF19 and increased C4 concentrations. Serum BA
concentrations decreased consistently with increased fecal BA
excretion (Graffner et al., 2016).
The second trial evaluated the IBAT inhibitor SHP626
(Volixibat) in 50 healthy subjects and in addition in 11 patients
with type 2 diabetes mellitus /T2DM). SHP626 was administered
in a dose range of 0.5–10 mg/day for 28 days. SHP626, as
compared with placebo, increased mean total fecal BA excretion
about ∼1.6–3.2 times in healthy volunteers and ∼8 times in
patients with T2DM. With SHP626, mean C4 concentrations
increased by ∼1.3–5.3-fold from baseline to day 28 in healthy
volunteers and twofold in T2DM patients (Tiessen et al., 2018).
The third trial evaluated the IBAT inhibitor GSK2330672 in a
4-period crossover study in 16 Japanese subjects with single oral
doses of GSK2330672 (10–180 mg) or placebo in each period.
A dose-dependent tendency for total serum BAs to reduce and
for serum C4 to increase was observed (Ino et al., 2018).
All three IBAT inhibitors showed similar adverse events: dose￾dependent diarrhea (up to 50, 100, and 83% with A4250, SHP626,
and GSK2330672, respectively) and abdominal pain (up to 33, 78,
and 17% with A4250, SHP626, and GSK2330672, respectively)
(Graffner et al., 2016; Ino et al., 2018; Tiessen et al., 2018).
IBAT INHIBITION FOR THE TREATMENT
OF CONSTIPATION-PREDOMINANT
IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME
Impaired or absent reuptake of BAs in the terminal ileum
as seen in Crohn’s patients with active ileal disease or after
terminal ileal resection may result in diarrhea. This clinical
condition is nowadays termed type 1 BA malabsorption in
contrast to idiopathic or type 2 BA malabsorption where impaired
function of IBAT or impaired ileal feed-back regulation of BA
synthesis may be the reason for BA diarrhea (Mottacki et al.,
2016). A 2-week proof-of-concept study in patients with primary
and secondary BA diarrhea indicated the potential benefit of
enhancing FGF19 feedback signaling from the terminal ileum
by administration of obeticholic acid (Walters et al., 2015).
Idiopathic adult-onset BA malabsorption is not a rare finding
and may often be the underlying cause of diarrhea-predominant
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) (Wedlake et al., 2009).
Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of IBAT might
increase the number of bowel movements in patients with
constipation-predominant IBD (IBD-C) or chronic idiopathic
constipation (CIC). Indeed, this concept has successfully
been tested using the IBAT inhibitor A3309 (Elobixibat) in
European, United States and Japanese patients, respectively
(Supplementary Table 1). In the first single-center randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 30 patients with CIC
were randomized into five dose-levels (range: 0.1–10 mg/day)
or placebo for 14 days (Simren et al., 2011). A3309 induced
BA synthesis (C4) and reduced FGF19, as well as total and
LDL cholesterol. Colonic transit time was reduced in the highest
dose group and, overall, a trend for an increased number of
bowel movements was observed (Simren et al., 2011). In a larger
phase IIb randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo￾controlled trial, 190 patients with CIC were randomized to
5, 10, or 15 mg A3309 or placebo once daily (Chey et al.,
2011). All patients randomized to A3309 noticed a significant
improvement in spontaneous bowel movements (SBM) that was
dose-dependent and maintained over 8 weeks. In addition, A3309
improved the serum lipid profile with significant decreases in

FIGURE 1 | Bile acid synthesis in the liver. Bile acids (BAs) synthesis from cholesterol synthesis requires almost 20 enzymatic reactions in different subcellular
compartments of the hepatocyte. The rate limiting enzyme is cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). Its activity is reflected by serum 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one
(C4) which is formed by the action of 3β-hydroxy-15
-C27-steroiddehydrogenase/isomerase (HSD3B7). In humans (shown in green), the primary BAs are
chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and cholic acid (CA); the ratio between them is determined by 12α-hydroxylase (CYP8B1), which is required for the formation of CA.
In rodents (shown in yellow), there are additional primary BAs; ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and α-and β-muricholic acids (α/β MCA). α/βMCAs are generated by
7β-hydroxylation of CDCA and UDCA by cytochrome CYP2C70 while the mechanism of epimerization of CDCA toward UDCA still is unknown. BAs are conjugated
with glycine- or taurine (in humans) and with taurine (in rodents) before excretion into bile. Murine BA profiles are much more hydrophilic than human BA profiles and
have substantially different activation proprieties of the nuclear BA receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR, see Figure 2). While CDCA is the strongest natural activator of
FXR, taurine-conjugated α/βMCAs are natural antagonists of FXR, which one needs to keep in mind when translating BA-related metabolic data from rodents to
humans.
total and LDL cholesterol in the 10- and 15-mg dose groups
while HDL cholesterol or triglycerides did not change. The most
common adverse events were abdominal pain and diarrhea,
which occurred most commonly in the 15-mg A3309 group
(Chey et al., 2011). A third randomized placebo-controlled study
in 36 women with functional constipation administered 15 or
30 mg A3309 for 14 days. The IBAT inhibitor accelerated colonic
transit and loosened stool consistency. Main adverse effects also
in this trial were abdominal pain and diarrhea (Wong et al.,
2011). In the fourth phase II trial with A3309, 163 Japanese
patients were randomized to placebo or either 10 or 15 mg A3309
(Nakajima et al., 2018a). A dose of 10 mg/day was considered
optimal; common adverse events included mild abdominal pain
and diarrhea in the A3309 groups. Subgroup analysis indicated
that A3309 was equally effective in patients with or without IBS-C
(Nakajima et al., 2018a).
Recently, the combined results of two phase 3 trials with
A3309 for CIC in Japanese patients have been published. The
first was a randomized placebo-controlled 2-weeks trial with
15 mg/day of A3309 in 133 patients, the other an open label trial
were 341 patients could titrate the dose of A3309 between 5 and
15 mg/day (Nakajima et al., 2018b). A3309 resolved constipation
in the short-term trial and resulted in sustained improvement
in bowel functions and quality of life in the 52-week treatment
period where mild gastrointestinal disorders occurred in 40%
of patients. A3309 also significantly reduced LDL cholesterol.
Abdominal pain and diarrhea were reported in 19 and 13% in
the 2-weeks, and in 24 and 15% in the 52 weeks trial, respectively
(Nakajima et al., 2018b). Based on these studies, on January 20,
2018, A3309 was approved in Japan for the treatment of chronic
constipation.
PRE-CLINICAL TRIALS OF IBAT
INHIBITORS IN MOUSE MODELS OF
LIVER DISEASES
The accumulation of BAs undoubtedly plays a major role in liver
injury in cholestatic liver disease (Fickert and Wagner, 2017),
and aberrant BA profiles have been found in various studies of
human obesity and metabolic syndrome-related diseases such as
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and NAFLD/NASH (Molinaro
et al., 2018). Importantly, BAs both by intestinal and hepatic FXR
activation in addition to cholesterol turnover via apoA1, LDLR,
and SR-B1 also regulate triglyceride metabolism by pathways
that involve FXR, SHP and sterol responsive element binding
protein 1c (SREBP-1c) and FG15/FGF19 (reviewed in Chavez￾Talavera et al., 2017). Thus, both by depleting the BA pool and
interruption of intestinal FXR activation, IBAT inhibitors may
improve liver function both in cholestatic and/or non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH) (Arab et al., 2017). This hypothesis is supported by
pre-clinical studies using animal models of cholestatic and
fatty liver disease. IBAT inhibitors SC-435 and A4250 were

FIGURE 2 | Enterohepatic circulation of bile acids and mode of action of ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT) inhibitors. Glycine- or taurine- conjugated BAs are excreted
via the bile salt export pump (BSEP) into bile in which they reach the duodenum. About 95% of conjugated BAs are reabsorbed in the terminal ileum via the apical
sodium-dependent BA transporter (ASBT, SLC10A2; also known as IBAT, ileal BA transporter) and recirculated to the liver via the portal vein from which they are
reabsorbed via the sodium-dependent taurocholate co-transporting peptide (NTCP, SLC10A1). This recycling process is called enterohepatic circulation. The
rate-limiting enzyme of BA synthesis from cholesterol, CYP7A1, is controlled by two different negative feed-back pathways that are both regulated by binding of BAs
to its nuclear receptor, FXR: (1) within the liver, when BA exceed physiological levels as in cholestasis, via small heterodimer partner (SHP) that signals to reduced
expression of CYP7A1 and NTCP, and increased expression of BSEP; and (2) from the ileum via increased formation of fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19, FGF15 in
rodents), which circulates to the liver in portal blood, binds to the heterodimer FGF4-receptor/β-klotho, and triggers a signaling cascade to inhibit CYP7A1. When
ileal reuptake of BAs is functionally impaired as in BA malabsorption syndrome or pharmacologically blocked with an IBAT inhibitor (right part of figure), BAs decrease
and fecal BA excretion increases which may cause BA malabsorptive diarrhea. Decreased BA activation of ileal FXR results in reduced formation of FGF19 and
diminished feed-back inhibition of BA synthesis. Increased BA synthesis via CYP7A1, reflected by increased serum C4, depletes the liver from cholesterol, which is
compensated by increased cholesterol synthesis and the enhanced expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), which results in decreased serum LDL
cholesterol.
investigated in Mdr2−/− mice, which is an established model
of sclerosing cholangitis (Fickert et al., 2004), and SC-435 was
also studied in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced fatty liver disease.
SC-435 was previously described to lower serum cholesterol
and reduce atherosclerosis in dogs, apolipoprotein E (apoE)
deficient mice (Bhat et al., 2003), and guinea pigs (West et al.,
2003).
In one study in Mdr2−/− mice, 30-day-old female mice were
fed HFD containing 0.006% SC-435 for 14 days. Compared with
untreated mice, SC-435 resulted in an eightfold increase in fecal
BA excretion, with a concomitant 90-fold reduction of serum
BA concentrations and reduction of serum alanine transferase
(ALT), total bilirubin, and serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
levels, indicating anti-inflammatory and anti-cholestatic effects.
Liver histology improved and the extent of fibrosis decreased
concomitant with reduced expression of hepatic profibrotic
genes (Miethke et al., 2016). In another study, 8-week-old
Mdr2−/− (Abcb4−/−) mice received either a diet supplemented
with A4250 (0.01% w/w) or a chow diet. A4250 significantly
reduced serum ALT, ALP and BA levels, hepatic expression of
pro-inflammatory (Tnf-α, Vcam1, Mcp-1) and pro-fibrogenic
(Col1a1, Col1a2) genes, cholestatic injury in liver histology
and bile duct proliferation as shown by immunohistochemistry
for cytokeratin 19 (CK19). Furthermore, A4250 significantly
reduced bile flow and biliary BA output while biliary HCO−
3
and phospholipid secretion was preserved. Importantly, A4250
profoundly increased fecal BA excretion without causing diarrhea
(Baghdasaryan et al., 2016). Both these studies thus showed
that IBAT inhibition improved biochemical and histological
features of sclerosing cholangitis, indicating that this drug
treatment could be potentially beneficial for human cholestatic
liver disease.
SC-435 then was studied in male C57Bl/6J mice fed HFD
for 16 weeks. To show its protective effect against NAFLD,

Al-Dury and Marschall ASBT/IBAT Inhibitors
SC-435 was administered during the whole 16 weeks HFD
period while administration of SC-435 was first started after
12 weeks to show its ability to reverse the effects of HFD. SC￾435 induced mRNA expression of BA synthesis genes in the
liver and reduced mRNA expression of ileal BA-responsive genes,
including FGF15 (murine homolog of human FGF19). SC-435
also restored glucose tolerance, reduced hepatic triglyceride
and total cholesterol concentrations, and improved NAFLD
activity score in HFD-fed mice. These changes were associated
with reduced hepatic expression of lipid synthesis genes and
normalized expression of the central lipogenic transcription
factor, Srebp1c (Rao et al., 2016). Despite fourfold increased
fecal BA excretion during SC-435 treatment, total liver BAs
did not change. Rather, hepatic BA profiles in HFD fed mice
shifted from a more hydrophilic and FXR antagonistic/non￾agonistic composition with 42% 6-hydroxylated (murine) BAs to
are more hydrophobic and FXR agonistic composition (17% 6-
hydroxylated BAs). Of note, the phenotype of HFD-fed Asbt−/−
mice was very similar to HFD and SC-435 treated wild-type
mice, further supporting the concept that interruption of the
enterohepatic circulation of BAs might protect against NAFLD
(Rao et al., 2016).
PHASE 2 CLINICAL TRIALS WITH IBAT
INHIBITORS FOR THE TREATMENT OF
CHOLESTATIC PRURITUS
Cholestatic liver diseases arise from impaired hepatobiliary
production and excretion of bile, which cause bile constituents to
enter the circulation. Injuries to bile ducts or hepatocytes can lead
to a range of clinical presentations, from isolated abnormalities in
liver biochemistry, to liver failure or hepatobiliary malignancy;
congenital, immunologic, structural (obstructive/vascular), and
toxic factors can all contribute to disease. In response to
injury, mature cholangiocytes and hepatocytes proliferate, which
may lead to periductular fibrosis, biliary fibrosis, and cirrhosis.
Disease progression and the efficacy of repair depend on
etiology and the individual’s response to injury. Most common
cholestatic liver diseases in adults are primary biliary cholangitis
(PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and drug-induced
cholestasis and in children, Alagille syndrome, biliary atresia, and
progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) (Hirschfield
et al., 2010).
Pruritus (itch) is a frequent and troublesome symptom in
patients with cholestatic liver disease, in particular in PBC where
it is seen in 60–70% of patients at some point during the
disease process (Talwalkar et al., 2003). The pathogenesis of
cholestatic pruritus is complex and several putative pruritogens
have been proposed, including circulating BAs (Beuers et al.,
2014). Recently, autotaxin was identified as a major contributor
to cholestatic pruritus (Kremer et al., 2010, 2012). Limiting
the amount of circulating BAs by the administration of BA
binding resins (BA sequestrants) is an established treatment
modality of cholestatic pruritus and despite modest evidence
of its efficacy and poor tolerability profile, cholestyramine
is the only drug licensed for the treatment of PBC-related
pruritus (European Association for the Study of the Liver,
2017). Rifampicin as second-line therapy for cholestatic pruritus
has a success rate of about 50% in clinical practice but is
hampered by hepatotoxic side effects (Prince et al., 2002).
Other drug therapies including opiate antagonists (as third-line
therapy), selective serotonin uptake inhibitors and gabapentin
are less well-documented (European Association for the Study
of the Liver, 2009). Nasobiliary drainage effectively reliefs from
cholestatic pruritus but is invasive and uncomfortable (Hegade
et al., 2016).
Although the role of BAs in the pathogenesis of cholestatic
pruritus remains unclear (as BA levels in serum, urine, or skin
do not correlate with severity of pruritus) (Beuers et al., 2014),
depleting the BA pool by the administration of IBAT inhibitors
might improve itching. This concept has been tested in pilot and
phase II trials in both PBC and pediatric cholestatic liver diseases
(Supplementary Table 1).
The IBAT inhibitor GSK2330672 was tested in a double￾blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial in two
United Kingdom medical centers (Hegade et al., 2017). In
this study, 22 PBC patients with refractory, severe pruritus
received 14 days each of placebo or GSK2330672 (45–90 mg
twice daily) with randomization to the sequence of placebo
and GSK2330672. Pruritus as estimated by visual analog scale
(VAS), PBC-40 itch domain and 5-D itch scale improved by
placebo but the IBAT inhibitor was significantly more efficient
in any of these parameters and the effect was independent
of the course of treatment. GSK2330672 reduced serum BAs,
FGF19 and autotaxin and increased C4 concentrations. Of note,
33% of the patients receiving GSK2330672 reported diarrhea
and a substantial number of patients reported abdominal pain,
but no study subjects withdraw from treatment (Hegade et al.,
2017). The phase 2 trial of GSK2330672 administration for the
treatment of pruritus in patients with primary biliary cholangitis
(GLIMMER) trial is currently recruiting 118 patients for a 16-
week treatment (NCT02966834).
The IBAT inhibitor SHP625 (LUM001, Lopixibat, Maralixibat)
was administered for 12 weeks in 66 PBC patients at a dose
of 10–20 mg once daily (Mayo et al., 2016). This compound
was not more efficient on pruritus than placebo, which
markedly decreased all itching scores. In patients randomized
to SHP625, serum BA reductions and C4 increases reached
nominal significance; however, a higher incidence of diarrhea and
abdominal pain was reported, resulting in withdrawal in 2/42
patients (Mayo et al., 2016). SHP625 has also been tested in 27
patients with PSC but no data are available as yet.
In a recent pilot study, we assessed the tolerability and
effect on pruritus of A4250 in patients with PBC. Nine patients
with ongoing long-term BA sequestrant treatment of cholestatic
pruritus were treated with A4250 for 4 weeks after a 2-week wash
out of the resins. Patients’ pruritus was also here assessed by VAS,
5-D itch scale and the PBC40 pruritus module. All nine patients
exposed to A4250 (0.75 mg, n = 4; 1.5 mg, n = 5) reported a
rapid (within 48 h) and substantial improvement in pruritus that
in particular restored normal sleep at night in the four patients
who finished the whole 4-week treatment period with A4250.
Also scratch marks on the skin diminished in the patients who

Al-Dury and Marschall ASBT/IBAT Inhibitors
had this sign of severe pruritus. However, five of the nine patients
exposed to A4250 withdrew already during the first week due to
diarrhea and abdominal pain, which indicates that the starting
dose of A4250 might have been too high (Al-Dury et al., 2018).
The effect of IBAT inhibitors SHP625 and A4250 on
pruritus was also investigated in various cholestatic pediatric
liver diseases. Thirty-seven patients with Alagille syndrome
were randomly assigned to receive either SHP625 (70, 140, or
280 µg/kg/day once-daily) or placebo for 13 weeks. Pruritus
was assessed using a novel pediatric version of the Itch Report
Outcome (ItchROTM) and a clinician-reported scratch scale, both
of which grade the severity of reported itching on a scale of 0–4
(none to severe). The percentage of patients with a decrease in
the degree of itching from baseline to week 13 was higher among
those who received SHP625 than those who received placebo for
both scales (ItchRO: 65 vs. 25%; clinician-reported scratch scale:
76 vs. 25%, respectively). Adverse events were similar between
SHP625 and placebo recipients (Shneider et al., 2017).
In another study with SHP625, this IBAT inhibitor was
administered for 48 weeks to 33 children with PFIC (age:
1–13 years); the SHP625 dose was escalated from 14 to
280 µg/kg/day over 13 weeks (depending on tolerability) and
maintained for up to 50 weeks. Efficacy data were available in
26/29 participants who reached week 48 (PFIC1, n = 6; PFIC2,
n = 20), of whom 23 were receiving maralixibat 280 µg/kg/day.
In 6/20 participants with PFIC2 (30%), efficacy profiles over
48 weeks indicated clinically significant response to SHP625:
BA levels normalized to ≤8.5 µmol/L (n = 4) or reduced by
≥70% (n = 2); ItchRO scores showed no pruritus (n = 2) or
improved by ≥1.0 points (n = 4). Treatment-emergent adverse
events were reported in all 33 participants, were judged related
to SHP625 in 22, serious in 15 and led to discontinuation in 1.
The most frequently reported treatment related adverse events
were pyrexia (n = 15), diarrhea (n = 14), cough (n = 13),
abdominal pain (n = 10), and vomiting (n = 10) (Thompson et al.,
2017).
A4250 was administered to 20 pediatric patients (12 males,
8 females, age: 1–17 years) with PFIC type 1, 2, or 3
(n = 13: 3 re-entries), Alagille syndrome (n = 6), biliary
atresia (n = 3), and intrahepatic cholestasis (n = 2; 1 re-entry).
A4250 was administered orally once daily for 4 weeks at
five doses (10–200 µg/kg). Serum BAs decreased significantly
(p < 0.008). Patients reported an improvement in pruritus and
sleep, and reductions in VAS-Itch were significantly correlated
with reductions in serum BAs. No serious adverse events were
deemed treatment related, and most adverse events, including
some increased transaminases, were transient (Sturm et al.,
2017).
PHASE 2 CLINICAL TRIALS WITH IBAT
INHIBITORS FOR THE TREATMENT OF
NON-ALCOHOLIC STEATOHEPATITIS
(NASH)
In the T2DM cohort of the phase 1 study with SHP626, trends
were observed toward increased levels of HDL cholesterol,
decreased levels of serum triglycerides and reductions in fasting
glucose levels that were considered suggestive of improvements
in both lipid and glucose homeostasis (Tiessen et al., 2018).
T2DM and obesity are the most common underlying disorders in
NAFLD and its serious form NASH. Recently, SHP626 has gained
fast track designation by the food and drug administration (FDA)
and is now being tested in a phase II double-blind, randomized,
placebo-controlled, dose-finding trial with 292 patients. SHP626
or placebo is being orally administered for 48 weeks at a daily
dose of 5, 10, or 20 mg. The primary outcome of this study
(NCT02787304) is a reduction from baseline of the NAFLD
activity score of at least two points, without worsening of
fibrosis, at 48 weeks. Other outcome parameters are changes in
liver fat content (as measured by magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), fibrosis state, liver enzymes, bilirubin and metabolic
biochemistry.
In summary, so far IBAT inhibition has only emerged as
treatment option in chronic constipation, gaining its benefit by
inducing BA malabsorptive diarrhea. For cholestatic pruritus,
published data, while somewhat inconclusive, support the
hypothesis that the interruption of the enterohepatic circulation
of BAs via IBAT inhibition has the potential to relieve patients
from itch. However, the substantial incidence of abdominal
pain and diarrhea may limit its applicability, at least in adults
and during long-term treatment. Careful drug administration
regiments might help to improve tolerability, in particular
very slowly increasing doses. Certainly, efficacy and tolerability
need to be compared to BA sequestrants although it seems
to be very difficult to do this under placebo-controlled
conditions.
PERSPECTIVE
Depletion of the BA pool from potentially toxic compounds by
interrupting their enterohepatic circulating with drugs that have
very low systemic enrichment is conceptionally interesting and it
might turn out that patients with liver inflammation as in NASH
might have the highest clinical benefit. Also, these compounds
might have a role in combination therapies, e.g., with nor￾ursodeoxycholic acid (Fickert et al., 2017), where reabsorption of
conjugated in contrast to de novo absorption of unconjugated BA
is less desirable as this would result in higher enrichment of the
unconjugated compounds in the BA pool.
