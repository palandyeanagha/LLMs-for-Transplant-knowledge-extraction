Nucleic acid amplification technique–based assays
are a primary method for the detection of acute hepati￾tis E virus (HEV) infection, but assay sensitivity can vary
widely. To improve interlaboratory results for the detection 
and quantification of HEV RNA, a candidate World Health
Organization (WHO) International Standard (IS) strain was
evaluated in a collaborative study involving 23 laboratories
from 10 countries. The IS, code number 6329/10, was for￾mulated by using a genotype 3a HEV strain from a blood
donation, diluted in pooled human plasma and lyophilized.
A Japanese national standard, representing a genotype 3b
HEV strain, was prepared and evaluated in parallel. The
potencies of the standards were determined by qualita￾tive and quantitative assays. Assay variability was sub￾stantially reduced when HEV RNA concentrations were
expressed relative to the IS. Thus, WHO has established
6329/10 as the IS for HEV RNA, with a unitage of 250,000
International Units per milliliter.
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a nonenveloped, single￾stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Hepeviri￾dae (1,2). In developing countries, HEV is a major cause of 
acute hepatitis, transmitted by the fecal–oral route and as￾sociated with contamination of drinking water. In industrial￾ized countries, reports of HEV infection have been uncom￾mon but are being reported more frequently; some cases are 
imported after travel to HEV-endemic areas, but reports of 
autochthonous cases are also increasing, and infection with 
HEV appears to be more prevalent than originally believed 
(3). Prospects for control of HEV infection are encouraged 
by recent efforts in vaccine development (4,5). 
Four main genotypes of HEV, representing a single 
serotype, infect humans. Genotype 1 viruses are found 
mainly in Africa and Asia and genotype 2 in Africa and 
Central America; it is in these areas that prevention of 
HEV infection by vaccination would be most beneficial. 
Genotypes 3 and 4 viruses are generally less pathogenic, 
although some exceptions have been reported, particularly 
for genotype 4; these genotypes infect not only humans but 
also animals such as swine, wild boar, and deer. Although 
genotype 4 strains have mainly been restricted to parts of 
Asia, genotype 3 viruses are found widely throughout the 
world. Zoonotic transmission of HEV genotypes 3 and 4 to 
humans can occur by consumption of contaminated meat 
or meat products or by contact with infected animals (6,7). 
Shellfish, such as bivalve mollusks, have also been shown 
to act as reservoirs for HEV (8).
An alternate route of transmission of HEV by trans￾fusion of blood components has been reported in Japan 
(9,10), the United Kingdom (11), and France (12,13). Stud￾ies in Japan (14) and the People’s Republic of China (15) 
have identified acute HEV infections in blood donors, con￾firmed by the detection of HEV RNA. Analysis of blood 
and plasma donors in Europe has identified HEV-infected 
donors in Germany (16–20), Sweden (18), and England 
(21). Transmission of HEV by solid organ transplantation 
has also been reported (22). Rates of HEV infection may be 
underreported in some countries, and misdiagnosis of HEV 
infection also occurs. For example, in some cases of sus￾pected drug-induced liver injury, HEV has been determined

as the cause (23). In one such recent case, HEV was shown 
to have been transmitted by blood transfusion (13).
Infection with HEV may cause particularly severe ill￾ness in pregnant women and in persons who have preexist￾ing liver disease. Chronic infection with HEV genotype 3 is 
an emerging problem among solid organ transplant recipi￾ents and may also occur in persons with HIV and certain 
hematologic disorders (24). In patients with chronic infec￾tion, viral loads are monitored to investigate the efficacy 
of antiviral treatment (25,26) and effects of reduction of 
immunosuppressive therapy (27).
HEV infection is diagnosed on the basis of detection of 
specific antibodies (IgM and IgG), but the sensitivity and 
specificity of these assays is not optimal (28–30). Analy￾sis of HEV RNA by using nucleic acid amplification tech￾niques (NATs) is also used for diagnosis; this method can 
identify active infection and help confirm serologic results 
(31). Several NAT assays have been reported for the detec￾tion of HEV RNA in serum and plasma or fecal samples: 
conventional reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and 
nested protocols (32), real-time RT-PCR, and reverse tran￾scription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (33). The 
NATs include generic assays designed for the detection of 
HEV genotypes 1–4 (34,35). 
In 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) Ex￾pert Committee on Biological Standardization endorsed a 
proposal by the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut (PEI) to prepare an 
International Standard (IS) for HEV RNA for use in NAT￾based assays. PEI recently completed an initial study that 
investigated the performance of HEV NAT assays in de￾tection of HEV infection (36). In that study, dilution pan￾els of HEV genotype 3 and 4 strains underwent blinded 
testing in laboratories that had experience in detection 
of HEV RNA. Results demonstrated wide variations in 
assay sensitivity (in the order of 100- to 1,000-fold for 
most assays). 
After the initial study, 2 virus strains included in the 
panel (36) were selected for further development of a can￾didate IS for the WHO, and a candidate Japanese national 
standard (done in collaboration with the National Institute 
of Infectious Diseases in Tokyo). These viruses belong to 
genotype 3, which is widely distributed, and were geno￾type 3a and 3b strains, which were equally well detected 
in the initial study. The strains were derived from plasma 
samples that had sufficient titers of HEV RNA to prepare 
standards of good potency. An international collaborative 
study was conducted to establish the respective standards, 
demonstrate suitability for use, evaluate potency, and as￾sign an internationally agreed-upon unitage.
Methods
Preparation of Materials
The 2 HEV strains selected for the preparation of the 
candidate WHO IS and candidate Japanese national stan￾dard were genotype 3a strain HRC-HE104 and genotype 
3b strain JRC-HE3, respectively. The HEV-positive plas￾ma donations were kindly provided by the Japanese Red 
Cross Society Blood Service Headquarters (Tokyo, Ja￾pan). Characterization of the stock virus strains is shown 
in Table 1. 
The samples were tested for IgG/IgM against HEV by 
using an HEV enzyme immunoassay (Institute of Immu￾nology Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Full-length sequences of 
the HEV strains were determined as described (37). Phy￾logenetic analyses were conducted by using MEGA ver￾sion 5.05 (38), and HEV genotype and subgenotype were 
determined as described (39). The nucleotide sequenc￾es of HRC-HE104 and JRC-HE3 were deposited into 
GenBank under accession nos. AB630970 and AB630971, 
respectively.
The target HEV RNA concentration for the 2 bulk 
standard preparations was ≈5.5 log10 HEV RNA copies/
mL, on the basis of the concentrations determined in the 
initial study (36). The 2 virus strains were negative when 
tested for hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and HIV-1/2 
by using the Cobas TaqScreen MPX test (Roche Molecular 
Systems Inc., Branchburg, NJ, USA). The samples were 
diluted by using pooled citrated plasma (36) that had tested 
negative by NAT for hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, 
and HIV-1/2, and HEV and was also negative for antibod￾ies against HEV by using the recomWell IgG and IgM 
enzyme immunoassays (Mikrogen GmbH, Neuried, Ger￾many). The diluted plasma was placed into 4-mL screw￾cap glass vials, freeze dried, filled with nitrogen, sealed 
with rubber stoppers, and stored at –20°C. Stability studies 
demonstrated no substantial change in HEV RNA concen￾tration after freeze drying or after 10 months of storage at 
–20°C (the usual temperature), +4°C, and +20 to +26°C, 
compared with samples stored at <−80°C.

Standard to Harmonize Assays for Detection of HEV
Study Design
The collaborative study was conducted by 24 labora￾tories from 10 countries; each laboratory was randomly as￾signed a code number. The samples analyzed in the study 
were coded sample 1 and sample 2 (replicates of the can￾didate WHO IS) and sample 3 and sample 4 (replicates of 
the candidate Japanese national standard). Samples were 
shipped to participants at ambient temperature. Participants 
tested the samples by using the laboratory’s routine assays 
for HEV RNA, in 4 separate assay runs, using fresh vi￾als of each sample for each run. Quantitative assay results 
falling within the linear range of the assays were reported 
in copies/mL. For qualitative assays, participants assayed 
each sample by a series of 1.0-log10 dilution steps to obtain 
an initial estimate of an endpoint and then, in 3 subsequent 
runs, assayed 0.5-log10 dilutions around the endpoint deter￾mined in the first run.
Statistical Methods
Quantitative Assays
Evaluation of quantitative assays was restricted to dilu￾tions of 0.0 log10 to -2.5 log10, a range over which the assays 
of most participants produced comparable data. For com￾parison of laboratories, the replicate results of each labora￾tory, corrected for the dilution factor, were combined as 
the arithmetic mean of log10 copies/mL. Furthermore, these 
estimates were combined to obtain an overall estimation 
for each sample by means of a mixed linear model, using 
laboratory and log10 dilution as random factors.
Qualitative Assays
The data from all assays were pooled to give a series 
of values for number positive/number tested at each dilu￾tion. For each participant, these pooled results were evalu￾ated by means of probit analysis to estimate the concen￾tration at which 50% of the samples tested were positive; 
for assays in which the change from complete negative to 
complete positive results occurred in <2 dilution steps, the 
Spearman-Kaerber method was applied for estimation. The 
calculated endpoint was used to give estimates expressed 
in log10 NAT-detectable units/mL, after correcting for the 
equivalent volume of the test sample.
Relative Potencies
For quantitative assays, potencies of samples 2, 3, 
and 4 were estimated relative to sample 1 by using par￾allel-line analysis of log-transformed data. For qualita￾tive assays, relative potencies were determined by using 
parallel-line analysis of probit-transformed data. Statisti￾cal analyses were performed by using SAS/STAT version 
9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Estimation of end￾point dilution and relative potencies was performed by us￾ing CombiStats version 4.0 (European Directorate for the 
Quality of Medicines and HealthCare/Council of Europe, 
Strasbourg, France).

RESEARCH
Results
Data were returned by 23 of the 24 participating labora￾tories; 20 sets of qualitative data and 14 sets of quantitative 
data were evaluated. The assays used by the participants 
are shown in online Technical Appendix Table 1 (wwwnc.
cdc.gov/EID/article/19/5/12-1845-Techapp1.pdf). All as￾says were developed in-house and were either conventional 
or nested RT-PCRs or based on real-time RT-PCR.
Quantitative and Qualitative Assay Results
Laboratory mean estimates for quantitative assays (in 
log10 copies/mL) and qualitative assays (in NAT-detectable 
log10 units/mL) for the HEV preparations are shown in 
histogram form in Figure 1, which shows that laboratory 
means are more variable for the qualitative assays than 
the quantitative assays, reflecting different assay sensitivi￾ties and lack of standardization. The individual laboratory 
means are given in online Technical Appendix Tables 2 
and 3; relative variation of the individual laboratory esti￾mates for the quantitative assays is illustrated by the box￾and-whisker plots in Figure 2. Intralaboratory variation 
was lower than the interlaboratory variation for both types 
of assays (data not shown).
Determination of Overall Laboratory Means
The means for all the laboratories performing quan￾titative assays are shown in Table 2. The means for sam￾ple 1 and sample 2, replicates for the candidate WHO IS, 
were 5.58 log10 and 5.60 log10 copies/mL HEV RNA, 
respectively, with good agreement between the replicate 
samples. The candidate Japanese national standard showed 
identical mean results of 5.66 log10 copies/mL HEV RNA for 
replicate samples 3 and 4.
The means for all the laboratories performing qualita￾tive assays are also shown in Table 2; again, there was good 
agreement between the duplicate samples. Results for the 
qualitative assays showed 0.3-log10 lower mean estimates 
and a higher SD than those for the quantitative assays. The 
combined mean values for the replicate samples for both 
types of assays are shown in Table 2.
Relative Potencies
On the basis of the combined data from both qualita￾tive and quantitative assays, the candidate WHO standard 
was determined to have a potency of 5.39 log10 units/mL 
(95% CI 5.15–5.63). This value was calculated with a com￾bined endpoint evaluation of qualitative and quantitative 
data (restricted to dilutions in the range of 0.0 log10 to -2.5 
log10) by means of a mixed linear model.
The potencies of samples 2, 3, and 4 were calculated 
relative to sample 1, taking the value of sample 1 as 5.39 
log10 units/mL. The relative potencies for the quantitative 
and qualitative assays are shown in online Technical Ap￾pendix Tables 4 and 5, respectively. Table 3 summarizes 
the overall mean potencies relative to sample 1, with the 
95% CIs, SDs, and geometric coefficients of variation. 
For the quantitative data from laboratory 9, no potency 
could be estimated by endpoint evaluation because only 1

dilution was tested for each sample. The data are plotted in 
histogram form in Figure 3. 
The data demonstrate that expressing the results as po￾tencies relative to sample 1 (set as a standard with an assumed 
unitage of 5.39 log10 units/mL) results in a marked improve￾ment in the agreement between the majority of methods and 
laboratories, as evidenced by the reduction in SDs. Further￾more, these data provide some evidence for commutability 
of the candidate standard for evaluation of HEV from in￾fected persons, because samples 1 and 2 represent a different 
strain of HEV compared with samples 3 and 4.
Discussion
In this study, a wide range of quantitative and qualitative 
assays were used to determine the suitability and evaluate 
the HEV RNA content of the candidate standards. Although 
the methods used by the study participants were all devel￾oped in-house, most assays consistently detected the 2 HEV 
strains. On the basis of data from the qualitative and quanti￾tative assays, the candidate WHO IS was estimated to have 
a potency of 5.39 log10 units/mL. For practical purposes, the 
candidate IS was assigned a unitage of 250,000 International 
Units (IU)/mL; because the difference in the overall mean 
for the candidate Japanese national standard was negligible 
compared with the WHO preparation, the 2 materials were 
assigned the same value. In the case of the quantitative as￾says, laboratories reported values in HEV RNA copies/mL. 
The participating laboratories used plasmid DNA contain￾ing HEV sequences, synthetic oligonucleotides, and in vi￾tro–transcribed HEV RNA to control for copy number. In 
some cases, laboratories used HEV-containing plasma that 
had been calibrated against in vitro–transcribed HEV RNA. 
One laboratory prepared a standard by using stool-derived 
virus, the titer of which was determined by endpoint dilution 
and analysis by Poisson distribution. No standard method or 
common quantitation standard material was used; this fact is 
reflected in the variation observed for the quantitative results 
(in the order of 2 log10), which were improved by express￾ing the results against sample 1 as a common standard. For 
qualitative assays, the variation in NAT-detectable units was 
>3 log10, and as with quantitative assays, expressing poten￾cies relative to sample 1 improved the agreement among the 
different laboratories and methods.
Many of the laboratories participating in the study used 
a real time RT-PCR developed in 2006 (34) that was de￾signed to detect the 4 main genotypes of HEV. However, a 
recent study in the United Kingdom found a polymorphism 
in the probe-binding site in several HEV-infected patients 
who initially had negative test results using this assay (40). 
A modification of the probe, increasing the melting temper￾ature, restored detection of the polymorphic virus strains. 
We identified a further polymorphism in an HEV strain 
(GenBank accession no. JN995566) from a plasma donor 
(18), located in the probe-binding site of the same assay; 
use of the modified probe improved the amplification curve 
for this virus strain (S. Baylis and T. Gärtner, unpub. data). 
Genetic variation and its potential effects on HEV RNA 
detection highlight the importance of confirmatory tests of 
different design, rather than reliance on single methods.
The WHO IS will be valuable for development of 
secondary standards traceable to the IU, which will fa￾cilitate comparison of results between laboratories and

determination of assay sensitivities and be helpful for vali￾dation purposes. We anticipate that the IS will find applica￾tion in clinical laboratories, particularly in hepatitis refer￾ence laboratories that perform diagnosis and monitor HEV 
viral loads in chronically infected patients. The IS will also 
be helpful for research laboratories and blood and plasma 
centers that implement HEV NAT screening, regulatory 
agencies and organizations that are working to develop 
HEV vaccines, and manufacturers of HEV diagnostic kits.
The established WHO IS has been prepared by using a 
genotype 3a HEV strain. WHO has further endorsed a pro￾posal by the PEI to prepare a genotype panel for HEV for 
NAT-based assays to continue standardization efforts for 
detection of this emerging infection. It is intended that the 
panel will contain representative strains of the 4 main geno￾types of HEV that infect humans and notable subgenotypes. 
A new collaborative study will evaluate the IS against other 
genotypes and subgenotypes of HEV and investigate the 
commutability of the IS for standardization of assays for 
different genotypes of HEV. Laboratories that are able to 
provide high-titer HEV samples to aid in development of 
the proposed panel are requested to contact the authors.
In summary, WHO has established a genotype 3a HEV 
strain as the IS for HEV RNA (code number 6329/10), with 
an assigned a unitage of 250,000 IU/mL. The WHO IS for 
HEV RNA is available from PEI (www.pei.de).
