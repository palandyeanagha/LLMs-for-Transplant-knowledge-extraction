Introduction
Liver transplantation is a treatment option for both acute 
liver failure (ALF) and end stage liver disease (ESLD). ALF 
is by far more morbid of the two states with acute and near￾catastrophic multi-organ failure with the liver as the central 
and precipitating failed organ. Cirrhosis, on the other hand, 
is a slow and insidious liver dysfunction resulting in gradual 
failure of all other systems in the body. As a consequence 
of these scenarios, all the organ dysfunctions and failures 
are carried through the phase of transplant surgery and 
the posttransplant intensive care phase. The functioning 
transplanted liver forms the common denominator of organ 
system recovery and gives the patient a new life. Whereas, 
in the unfortunate event of graft dysfunction or failure of 
the transplanted liver, the patient will continue to be in 
multi-organ failure and will require continued or even an 
enhanced level of critical care support.
The unique pathophysiology of patients with ESLD has 
important implications for their critical care treatment,

Critical care issues in adult liver transplantation
Palepu B. Gopal, Dharmesh Kapoor, Ravichandra Raya, M. Subrahmanyam, Deven Juneja,
B. Sukanya Abstract Over the last decade, liver transplantation has become an operational reality in our part of the world. As a result, 
clinicians working in an intensive care unit are more likely to be exposed to these patients in the immediate postoperative 
period, and thus, it is important that they have a working knowledge of the common complications, when they are likely 
to occur, and how to deal with them. The main focus of this review is to address the variety of critical care issues in 
liver transplant recipients and to impress upon the need to provide favorable circumstances for the new liver to start 
functioning and maintain the function of other organs to aid in this process. 
Key words: Adult liver transplantation, critical care, orthotopic liver transplantation 
particularly in the postoperative state. Typically 
endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation are 
continued into the postoperative period. As a standard 
practice, all the modalities of monitoring and medication 
are continued into the postoperative period, the degree of 
which will be decided depending on the progress of the 
patient. In a very stable low risk transplant, all anesthetic 
and relaxant medications can be discontinued and patient 
can be fast tracked to weaning and extubation. Otherwise, 
the patient continues to be infused with longer acting 
anesthetics, analgesics, and muscle relaxants. In such 
cases, the process of weaning and time of extubation will 
depend on the patient’s subsequent progress, which in 
turn is largely guided by ‘kick-starting’ of the engrafted 
liver. Intra-abdominal drains should be inspected for 
the nature and rate of blood and fl uid loss. Biochemical, 
hematological and microbiological monitoring are 
implemented on a periodic manner depending on the 
protocol of individual units. Radiological investigations 
like chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasound, hepatic vascular 
Doppler monitoring are done on a minimum daily 
basis till the patient continues to require critical care 
services. Doppler ultrasonography has high sensitivity 
and specifi city in evaluating hepatic artery, portal veins, 
hepatic veins, inferior vena cava, and the bile duct 
for signs of thrombosis or stenosis in a posttransplant
patient.

Though it is the degree of functioning of the transplanted 
liver that largely determines the other system functions, 
their dysfunction may be an outcome of an independent 
entity, not least important among which is sepsis. 
Optimum renal function is of paramount importance as 
a determinant of good outcome.[1]
Function of the Liver Allograft
A smooth ICU course after liver transplant is 
dependent on satisfactory graft function, which can be 
assessed by clinical parameters, such as wakefulness, 
normal mentation, improvement of muscle-power, 
stable respiratory effort, change in drain fl uid from 
sero-sanguinous to ascites, improvement in urine-output, 
and lab parameters including improvement in acidemia, 
stable platelet counts, stable and improving INR without 
use of fresh-frozen plasma, improving serum lactate, 
declining transaminases, and normal fl ow patterns on 
Doppler.
Serum bilirubin concentration gradually falls to normal 
levels during the fi rst week. Aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) peak during 
the fi rst three days and slowly level off, from then, in 
case of a healthy uptake of the grafted liver. Gamma 
glutamyl transferase and alkaline phosphatase, which 
are canalicular enzymes rise to four to fi ve times of 
normal and then return to normal in the next few days. 
Synthetic functions normalize after the third day. While 
all of the above parameters may remain equivocal, 
the deteriorating clinical condition with multi-organ 
dysfunction may be the main clue to the nonfunction 
of transplanted liver. In such situations, liver biopsy 
(percutaneous or transjugular) may provide the ultimate 
answer.
Hyperacute graft rejection is very rare in liver 
transplantation and occurs due to the presence of 
preformed antibodies. On the other hand, acute cellular 
rejection is as common as 15-25%.[2,3] It can be present 
from within few days to a few years, and so in reality 
the term acute is inaccurate. Here a rise in serum 
bilirubin is associated with rise in aminotransferases 
and canalicular enzymes. Clinical symptomatology can 
be rather nonspecifi c with loss of appetite, pruritis, and 
fever without tachycardia. This picture is associated with 
increased hepatic artery resistive index on Doppler. The 
diagnosis is made on liver biopsy and treatment based 
on severity or the degree of rejection (Banff score).[4,5]
The so called “chronic” rejection can also occur at any 
time and is evidenced by cholestatic features clinically 
and advancing arteriopathy and degenerating bile ducts 
on liver histology, with terminal liver failure ensuing 
eventually. Chronic rejection is extremely uncommon, 
accounting for less than 5%[6] of all cases of graft 
loss, and may occur due to untreated acute rejection, 
noncompliance to immunosuppression medication, or 
some immunological mechanisms which are not very 
well understood.
Various kinds of anastomotic problems can be 
present in the early postoperative days with varying 
incidence. Hepatic artery thrombosis, with incidence 
of 4-12%,[7] can present as sudden deterioration in 
hemodynamics, ARDS, severe coagulopathy, sudden 
and marked elevation of aminotransferases, with 
commonly accompanying liver abscesses due to bile duct 
strictures. Complications involving the portal vein are 
seen in 1.7-6% of liver transplant recipients.[8-10] Persistent 
ascites, enteric congestion and bleeding denoting portal 
hypertension, and later variceal hemorrhage may point 
to portal vein thrombosis. Doppler ultrasound followed 
by a traditional angiogram or magnetic resonance 
angiogram (MRA) will be diagnostic. Appropriate 
surgical or radiological intervention can be both, graft 
and life saving in these conditions. Patency of biliary 
tract can be jeopardized, either due to direct insult to 
the duct system or because of feeder vessel obstruction. 
Biliary tract complications account for up to 15% of 
postoperative surgical complications.[11] These are more 
common in partial grafts than in whole liver grafts. Again 
surgical intervention and/or radiological intervention 
are imperative.
Mediators from the liver or intestine may lead to a 
reperfusion syndrome after the graft is revascularized, 
which may manifest as hypotension from peripheral 
vasodilation, bradycardia, hyperkalemia, and pulmonary 
hypertension.
Systemic Management
Cardiovascular system 
An important aspect of pretransplant workup is to 
establish suitability of a patient to withstand the severe 
cardiopulmonary stress that the surgery poses to him. 
With the upper age limit of recipients being increasingly 
liberalized, the possibility of coronary artery disease 
in the recipient must be kept in mind. Since cirrhotic 
patients have a modifi ed lifestyle due to chronic and 
debilitating disease, as well as have a hyperdynamic 
systemic circulation, the classical symptoms of coronary 
insuffi ciency are often not present on presentation. This 
obviously does not imply an absence of the underlying 
cardiac disorder, which manifests in the intraoperative or 
early postoperative period, complicating the anesthetic 
and early ICU management.

Some patients, especially those with alcohol 
related cirrhosis, may present with reversible dilated 
cardiomyopathy after liver transplantation. [12] The 
intensivist must be aware of the possibility of perioperative 
myocardial infarction causing left ventricular dysfunction. 
Preoperative dobutamine stress echo (DSE) is a good 
screening test for occult coronary artery disease because 
it assesses the adequacy of myocardial oxygen supply. In 
addition, assessment must be made of valvular function 
and the presence of intrapulmonary shunting (by contrast 
Echo) and portopulmonary hypertension. A negative DSE 
predicts a good prognosis, that is, a low probability of 
perioperative cardiac events.[13] Unrecognized coronary 
artery disease is associated with a mortality of up to 50% 
and morbidity of 80%.[14] While high cardiac output is 
common in cirrhosis, a relative low cardiac output status 
may be seen in cirrhotic patients with cardiomyopathy 
and amyloidosis. These patients will need advanced 
hemodynamic monitoring such as Swan Ganz or PiCCO, 
and inotropic support.
Arterial hypotension is quite common in peritransplant 
period. A vasodilated and hyperdynamic state is 
typical of liver failure. These changes resolve slowly 
after liver transplantation. Magnitude of hepatic 
reperfusion syndrome may infl uence the posttransplant 
cardiopulmonary status. It may take days to weeks 
sometimes for these changes to revert to near normal. 
Failure to normalize with reduction in the level of 
vasoconstrictor support indicates poor prognosis. 
Sepsis may further complicate the picture. Elevated 
venous pressures will lead to hepatic congestion, and 
this may in turn increase the portal pressure. As a 
result of this, graft function may further suffer and 
lead to bacterial translocation and endotoxemia. To 
avoid such sequences of events, hypotension has to be 
classifi ed as cardiac or vasodilatory. Moderate fi lling 
followed by vasoconstriction should treat this. Whereas, 
inotropic support can be provided by dobutamine and 
adrenaline, vasoconstriction can be achieved with low 
dose noradrenalin or vasopressin. Cardiac tamponade 
has to be excluded in face of low cardiac output and high 
fi lling pressures. 
Systemic hypertension is common in the early 
postoperative period in a patient with a well functioning 
graft. It generally occurs either due to lack of analgesia 
or sedation in this setting. Later in the course of patient 
recovery, hypertension occurs due to cyclosporine or 
tacrolimus. Treatment is usually initiated when the 
systolic blood pressure is greater than 160 mmHg or 
the diastolic blood pressure greater than 100 mmHg. 
Atrial fi brillation may occur due to perioperative fl uid 
shifts, acid base imbalance and electrolyte abnormalities. 
Treatment includes etiological management, beta-blockers 
and calcium antagonists, but amiodarone should be 
avoided if possible because of its potential hepatotoxicity.
Pulmonary system
It is estimated that 45-69% patients with cirrhosis 
have some degree of hypoxemia.[15] Long-standing 
mechanical factors like ascites, atelectasis, and pleural 
effusion with restrictive lung changes are added to the 
major post upper abdominal surgical status leading to 
hypoxemia in the posttransplant period. Good pain 
control, chest physiotherapy, and incentive spirometry 
with functioning graft will improve this scenario. 
Widespread vasodilatation with vascular shunting in 
liver disease will have its refl ection on the pulmonary 
system. In a more etiopathogenic sense, hepatopulmonary 
syndrome (HPS) and porto-pulmonary hypertension 
(PPH) may continue into the posttransplant period. 
Introduction of pulmonary artery catheter is essential 
for management of these patients. HPS is hypoxemia 
in the background of liver disease with air contrast 
echocardiogram (Bubble study) demonstrable 
intrapulmonary shunting. This syndrome presents with 
dyspnea and desaturation on erect posture, platypnea 
and orthodeoxia. Their ventilation-perfusion mismatch 
resolves after a few days of successful transplantation. [16]
Fixed nonreversible shunt denotes poor prognosis. 
Pulmonary hypertension is more likely in cirrhotic 
patients with worsening porto-pulmonary shunting. This 
can affect right ventricular function and may have to be 
corrected with epoprostenol (prostacylclin-PG12
), which 
is a potent pulmonary and systemic vasodilator. Severe 
PPH is a contraindication to transplantation. Pulmonary 
hypertension developing fi rst time after transplant is 
usually due to pulmonary embolism.
Cardiogenic and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, 
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), and 
pulmonary infection are not uncommon in this period. 
In the immediate postoperative period, OLT recipients 
may develop ARDS as a result of the surgical insult 
or transfusion related acute lung injury[17] (TRALI). In 
case of a suspected infection, broncho-alveolar lavage 
has to be obtained for quantitative bacteriological and 
fungal cultures, which should be followed by sensitive 
antibiotics or antifungal agents. Early application of 
noninvasive ventilation rather than just supplemental 
oxygen can reduce the incidence of reintubations, major 
or fatal complications and overall mortality. Preventing 
intubation should be a major aim of management of 
respiratory failure in these immunocompromised patients.
Indian J Crit Care Med July-September 2009 Vol 13 Issue 3

Ventilatory strategies that minimize insult to the 
graft function should be used, as positive-pressure 
ventilation and high positive end-expiratory pressures 
may alter the splanchnic blood fl ow and decrease graft 
oxygenation and cause congestion of the inferior vena 
cava and hepatic vein drainage areas. Posttransplant 
ventilation is usually for a day or two, depending on 
various pulmonary and extra-pulmonary determinants. 
This is a risk-benefi t ratio evaluation between the need 
for good graft oxygenation and risk of infection. All 
possible precautions should be employed to avoid 
ventilator-associated pneumonia. 
Renal system
Pretransplant renal dysfunction is an independent 
predictor of posttransplant morbidity and mortality.[1]
Up to 25% of recipients suffer from renal impairment 
prior to transplantation, and nearly two-thirds of 
transplant recipients show impaired posttransplant renal 
function.[18] It has been found that in the posttransplant 
period there is a 40% decline in the glomerular fi ltration 
rate at the end of 6 weeks after which it stabilizes.[19]
The etiological reasons for renal dysfunction in the 
posttransplant phase include pre-transplant renal 
dysfunction, which maybe due to acute tubular necrosis 
(ATN) or hepato-renal syndrome or other medical 
problems, tubular damage due to peritransplant 
hypotension, graft dysfunction, ATN from postoperative 
sepsis and drug induced injury (cyclosporine, tacrolimus, 
amphotericin, aminoglycosides etc.). Management 
of renal dysfunction depends on the etiology. Those 
with HRS are more likely to require renal replacement 
therapy (RRT) with about 10% progressing to develop 
ESRD.[20] Intra-operative management of hypotension, 
use of veno-venous bypass,[21] and avoidance of 
nephrotoxic drugs are important reno-protective 
strategies. Nephrotoxicity is a known complication of 
calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) used to prevent rejection. 
Reducing the dosage, use of CNI sparing anti-rejection 
protocol or delaying introduction of CNIs in those with 
high probability of renal dysfunction and use of calcium 
channel blockers in CNI related hypertension have 
been found to be useful strategies in long term renal 
protection. Oliguria may be the earliest warning sign of 
renal dysfunction. 8-10% of transplant recipients require 
renal replacement therapy in the immediate post op 
period.[22,23] Dialysis, preferably lactate free continuous 
renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is required to stabilize 
these patients. So-called reno-protective agents like 
dopamine, calcium channel blockers or prostaglandins 
have not been proven to be of value. Combined liver and 
kidney transplant is an option reserved for those patients 
with pre-transplant renal dysfunction due to other 
concomitant medical illness or intrinsic renal disease.
Gastrointestinal system 
Many patients are severely malnourished before 
transplantation. As most patients have brisk return of 
gastrointestinal function, early enteral nutrition is the 
goal, except in patients with choledochojejunostomy. 
Upper gastrointestinal bleed is usually due to gastritis 
or stress ulceration. In general, upper gastrointestinal 
bleeding and good graft function do not co-exist. Portal 
vein thrombosis may result in recurrence of varices 
and bleeding. Posttransplant pancreatitis is a feared 
complication of liver transplantation. Conservative 
management is usually preferred to aggressive measures.
Central nervous system
A functioning allograft will generally improve 
neurological impairment, especially in those patients 
with certain pre-existing metabolic encephalopathy. 
Neurological events do occur, which can range from 
seizures to stroke to coma and are often fi rst recognized 
while the patient is still in the intensive care unit. Clinical 
series have documented neurological complications in 8.3% 
to 47% of all patients receiving liver transplantation. [24,25]
Alteration of mental status is common and upto 
one-third of liver recipients can have some degree of 
neurologic dysfunction in the perioperative period.[26]
Rapid recovery from encephalopathy is expected in the 
presence of good graft. Compromised graft function 
may result in recurrence of encephalopathy. Fulminant 
hepatic failure patients undergoing liver transplant need 
continuous monitoring of intra-cranial pressure. Focal 
defi cit should lead to suspicion of stroke or embolism. 
Acute change in mental status and occurrence of seizures 
should need checking up of drug, electrolytes and blood 
glucose levels. 
Psychosis is another feared complication in transplant 
recipients. It has a multifactorial etiology and could be 
due to prolonged ICU stay, use of steroids and other 
immunosuppressants. The fact that most antipsychotics 
are hepatotoxic is a major impediment in the treatment 
of this condition. Psychosis resulting in a noncompliant 
patient, can be a major stumbling block in rapid recovery, 
due to ineffective delivery of medication, physiotherapy 
and mobilization.
Endocrine and metabolic problems
Hyperglycemia is common because of surgical stress, 
steroid administration and insulin resistance associated 
with liver failure and there is increasing evidence to 
Indian J Crit Care Med July-September 2009 Vol 13 Issue 3

117
deploy tight control regimens.[27] Hypoglycemia may 
be a sign of inadequate graft function or severe sepsis.
Hypothermia is common in the posttransplant patient 
and can precipitate metabolic acidosis, and accentuate 
coagulopathy. Mild metabolic acidosis is common in the 
fi rst few hours after transplantation. Optimum fl uid and 
ionotropic management should attenuate this acidosis. 
Persistent metabolic acidosis in the absence of other 
causes should warrant suspicion of graft dysfunction. 
Slightly delayed acidosis may indicate sepsis. Serial 
lactate levels are helpful in managing such situations. 
Adrenal insufficiency and hypothyroidism are 
sometimes seen in these patients and have to be corrected 
after establishing the diagnosis.
Fluid and electrolytes
The recipient is generally kept in a euvolemic or slightly 
hypovolemic state in the posttransplant period, with 
minimal intravenous infusions, to optimize graft function 
and avoid pulmonary edema. If needed, 5% dextrose 
with 0.45% NS is used unless the serum sodium is less 
than 130 mEq/L, when 5% dextrose with 0.9% NS can 
be used. Gelatins are generally preferred to starches in 
these patients. Packed red cell and albumin transfusions 
are preferred when volume expansion is required.
Electrolyte imbalance is quite common in these 
patients. Hyponatremia should be gradually corrected 
with judicious use of fluids with a target serum 
sodium rise of 10-12 mEq/dL/day is desirable.[28]
Hypomagnesemia is common in cirrhotic patients 
and may be exacerbated in the posttransplant patient 
by excessive blood loss and medications (CNIs, loop 
diuretics, and amphotericin B). Recovering graft has a 
high requirement for phosphate and magnesium and 
these should be replaced adequately. Ionized serum 
calcium levels should be monitored as total calcium 
levels depend on the albumin concentration which may 
fluctuate widely in the early posttransplant period. 
Pretransplant hypocalcemia due to malnutrition and 
vitamin D dysfunction may be exacerbated early in 
the posttransplant patient by citrate chelation (with 
blood transfusion), gastrointestinal malabsorption and 
hepatocyte injury resulting in an intracellular shift of 
calcium. Hypercalcemia and hypermagnesemia are rare.
Coagulopathy
Coagulopathy results from preexisting portal 
hypertension, inadequate clotting factor synthesis, 
hypersplenism, fi brinolysis, hypocalcaemia and dilution. 
The risk of bleeding must be balanced against the risk of 
hepatic artery or portal vein thrombosis, so over correction 
should be avoided. Hence, monitoring of coagulation 
becomes mandatory after liver transplantation. 
Thrombelastography (TEG), a method for evaluating the 
viscoelastic properties of the blood clot, can be used to 
complement the standard coagulation parameters in these 
patients. TEG can be useful in differentiating between 
bleeding secondary to incomplete surgical hemostasis, 
platelet dysfunction or anomalies in coagulation factors 
and therefore, can help in optimizing and minimizing 
blood component usage by guiding use of selective blood 
component therapy.[29] TEG guided replacement can 
reduce transfusions and attendant complications.[30,31] It 
may also be useful in detecting a hypercoaguable state, not 
refl ected by standard coagulation parameters, which may 
be present after any major surgery and thus, may guide 
antithrombotic therapy with increased safety.[32,33] TEG has 
further advantages of allowing rapid bed-side monitoring 
and may be useful in assessing the graft function.[34]
Platelet dysfunction due to renal insuffi ciency can be 
managed with desmopressin. Replacement of blood 
products is necessitated in the presence of active bleeding 
or any planned intervention. Otherwise, maintenance of 
an INR between 1.5 and 2, a platelet count 50  109
/L 
and a fi brinogen level 100 mg/dL is satisfactory. 
Infection
The primary cause of death after liver transplantation 
is infection.[35] Bacterial and fungal infections are 
common in the early posttransplant period, originating 
from intravascular lines, lung, urinary tract, surgical 
wound, and the biliary system.[36] Prophylaxis against 
gram-negative bacteria is usually deployed depending 
on local antibiogram patterns. Prolonged surgery, 
multiple transfusions, malnutrition, hyperglycemia, 
requirement of dialysis and retransplantation are risk 
factors for fungal infections.[37] Viral infections are seen 
much later in this population. A detailed account of 
posttransplant infections is beyond the preview of this 
article [Table 1].
Immunosuppressive Therapy
Triple therapy is generally given in most centers based 
on a CNI, like tacrolimus or cyclosporin, in conjunction 
with an antiproliferative agent (mycophenolate 
mofetil) and a steroid.[41] A dual regimen of steroids 
and a CNI has shown to be equally effi cacious as triple 
therapy. [42] The advantage of early use of triple therapy 
is that it may allow delaying the initiation of the CNI, 
while the posttransplant changes in renal function 
recover. One must maintain a balance between 
under-immunosuppression, which may lead to graft 
Indian J Crit Care Med July-September 2009 Vol 13 Issue 3

118
rejection, and over-immunosuppression, which may 
lead to sepsis and malignancy.
Cyclosporin and tacrolimus seem to be similar in 
terms of graft and patients survival.[43] However, 
tacrolimus is associated with fewer episodes of rejection 
and less need for steroid use. Tacrolimus is equally 
nephrotoxic and is associated with increased rates of 
diabetes and neurotoxicity but has a lower incidence of 
hypertension and hyperlipidemia.[44,45]
Nutritional Support 
Factors such as preoperative malnutrition, stress from 
surgery, and immunosuppressive therapy, enhance the 
need for nutritional support after transplantation. In the 
immediate postoperative period, protein catabolism is 
markedly increased,[46] and hence, these patients should 
receive 1.5-2.0 grams of protein per kilogram of dry 
weight during this phase.[47] Energy requirements are not 
signifi cantly elevated; especially in an uncomplicated, 
nonseptic patient therefore, calories should be provided 
at approximately 120-130% of the calculated basal energy 
expenditure (BEE).[47] Patients should be encouraged to 
start oral diets as soon as tolerated. 
Conclusion
The principles guiding critical care for liver transplant 
patients, are to provide favorable circumstances for the 
new liver to start functioning and maintain the function 
of other organs to aid in this process.
