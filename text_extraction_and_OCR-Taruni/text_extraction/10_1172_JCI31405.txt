The ability of the immune system to identify and destroy nascent tumors, and to thereby function as a primary
defense against cancer, has been debated for many decades. Recent findings by a number of investigators in both
mouse models of cancer and humans with cancer now offer compelling evidence that particular immune cell types,
effector molecules, and pathways can sometimes collectively function as extrinsic tumor suppressor mechanisms.
This work provides the basis for further study of natural immunity to cancer and for rational use of this informa￾tion in the design of immunotherapies in combination with other conventional cancer treatments.
Introduction
The immune system has three primary roles in the prevention
of tumors. First, the immune system can protect the host from
virus-induced tumors by eliminating or suppressing viral infec￾tions. Second, the timely elimination of pathogens and prompt
resolution of inflammation can prevent the establishment of an
inflammatory environment conducive to tumorigenesis. Third,
the immune system can specifically identify and eliminate tumor
cells on the basis of their expression of tumor-specific antigens or
molecules induced by cellular stress.
The third process is referred to as tumor immune surveillance,
whereby the immune system identifies cancerous and/or precan￾cerous cells and eliminates them before they can cause harm. The
idea that the immune system, which so effectively protects the
host from microbial pathogens, might also recognize and destroy
tumor cells was first discussed over a century ago and has recently
been reviewed in detail (1). Despite tumor immune surveillance,
tumors do develop in the presence of a functioning immune sys￾tem, and therefore the updated concept of tumor immunoediting
(1) is a more complete explanation for the role of the immune sys￾tem in tumor development.
The tumorimmunoediting concept is divided into 3 phases, des￾ignated elimination, equilibrium, and escape (2) (Figure 1). The
elimination phase of cancerimmunoediting is exactly the same pro￾cess described in the initial theory of tumor immune surveillance,
whereby the immune system detects and eliminates tumor cells
that have developed as a result of failed intrinsic tumor suppres￾sor mechanisms. The elimination phase can be complete, when all
tumor cells are cleared, orincomplete,when only a portion oftumor
cells are eliminated. In the case of partial tumor elimination, the
theory of immunoediting is that a temporary state of equilibrium
can then develop between the immune system and the developing
tumor. During this period it is envisaged that tumor cells either
remain dormant or continue to evolve, accumulating further
changes (such as DNA mutations or changes in gene expression)
that can modulate the tumor-specific antigens and stress-induced
antigens that they express. As this process continues, the immune
system exerts a selective pressure by eliminating susceptible tumor
clones where possible. The pressure exerted by the immune system
during this phase is sufficient to control tumor progression, but
eventually, ifthe immune response stillfailsto completely eliminate
the tumor,the processresultsin the selection oftumor cell variants
that are able to resist, avoid, or suppress the antitumor immune
response, leading to the escape phase. During the escape phase the
immune system is no longer able to contain tumor growth, and a
progressively growing tumor results.
This new concept of cancer immunoediting is a more satisfac￾tory interpretation of various clinical and experimental data,which
implicate a protective role forthe immune system in tumor control.
The observationsthat have led to the concept oftumorimmunoed￾iting are reviewed here,with a particularfocus on experimental data
from various mouse models of cancer and clinical experience.
Evidence for cancer immunoediting in animal 
models of cancer
Spontaneous tumor development in immunodeficient mice. The sim￾plest approach for testing the role of the immune system in con￾trolling tumor development is to remove specific components of
the mouse immune system and monitor the mice for the develop￾ment of tumors. Predominantly through the use of gene-targeted
mice, this approach has demonstrated that a number of immune
effector cells and pathways are important for suppression of
tumor development (Table 1).
A role for the adaptive immune system in suppressing tumor
growth wasrevealed when it wasshown that 129/Sv RAG2-deficient
mice,which lack bothBandTcells, develop spontaneous adenocarci￾noma ofthe intestine and lung (35%and 15%,respectively, of all mice
analyzed) at 15–16 months of age, and an additional 50% of mice
develop intestinal adenomas (3). Interestingly, when Rag2–/– mice
were also deficient for STAT1, an important mediator of signaling
induced by both type I and type II IFN, tumor incidence is further
increased, and the spectrum of tumors broadens to include breast
adenocarcinomas (∼40% of mice), colon adenocarcinomas (∼10% of
mice), or both (∼20%of mice)(3).Together,these resultssuggestthat
both the innate and the adaptive arms of the immune system are
involved in the prevention of tumors, as mice lacking both IFN sig￾naling and an adaptive immune system develop a broaderspectrum
of tumorsthan mice only lacking an adaptive immune system.
Mice lacking T cell and NK cell cytotoxic effector pathways have
also been shown to develop spontaneous tumors. For example,
mice that lack perforin, a cytotoxic molecule used by cytotoxic cells

such asCD8+ T cells and NKcellsto form membrane poresin target
cells, develop lymphomaswith age. These spontaneouslymphomas
are of B cell origin, develop in older mice (>1 year of age) regard￾less of the mouse strain (4, 5), and, when transplanted into WT
mice, are rejected by CD8+ T cells(4). B cell lymphomas also arise in
mice lacking both perforin and β2m, and tumor onset is earlier and
occurs with increased prevalence compared with mice lacking only
perforin. In addition, B cell lymphomas derived from mice lacking
both perforin and β2m are rejected by either NK cells or γδ T cells
following transplantation to WT mice, rather than by CD8+ T cells
(asin tumors derived from mice lacking only perforin), demonstrat￾ing that cellsurface expression of MHC classI molecules by tumor
cells can be an important factorin determining which effector cells
mediate immune protective effects (6). Intriguingly, mutations in
the gene encoding perforin have also been identified in a subset of
lymphoma patients (7), although it is not clear whether this con￾tributesto disease. Mice lacking the death-inducing molecule TNF￾related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) or expressing a defective
mutant form of the death-inducing molecule FASL have also been
shown to be susceptible to spontaneous lymphomas that develop
with late onset(8, 9). These aging studies have clearly demonstrated
a critical role for cytotoxic pathways in immunoregulation and/or
immunosuppression of spontaneous tumor development in mice.
Several cytokine-deficient mice also develop spontaneous malig￾nancies(5, 10, 11). In one study, approximately 50% of IFN-γ–defi￾cient C57BL/6 mice were found to develop T cell lymphomas that

Extrinsic tumor suppression by the immune system. Transformed cells escaping intrinsic control are subjected to extrinsic tumor suppressor 
mechanisms that detect and eliminate developing tumors before they become clinically apparent. This is known as the elimination phase of a 
broader process that has been termed cancer immunoediting. Cancer immunoediting takes into account the observation that the immune system 
both protects the host against tumor development and promotes tumor growth. Cancer immunoediting is now considered a process composed 
of 3 phases: elimination, or cancer immune surveillance; equilibrium, a phase of tumor dormancy where tumor cells and immunity enter into a 
dynamic equilibrium that keeps tumor expansion in check; and escape, where tumor cells emerge that either display reduced immunogenicities 
or engage a large number of possible immunosuppressive mechanisms to attenuate antitumor immune responses leading to the appearance 
of progressively growing tumors. These phases have been termed the 3 Es of cancer immunoediting. DR5, death receptor 5; IDO, indoleamine

are predominantly disseminated lymphomas, although some
cases of thymic lymphoma are also noted; interestingly, the sus￾ceptibility of Ifng–/– mice to T cell lymphomas is strain dependent
(5). Furthermore, the spectrum of tumors observed in IFN-γ– and
STAT1-deficient mice do not overlap, despite STAT1 being a cru￾cialsignaling molecule downstream of the IFN-γ receptor, indicat￾ing either that these molecules have some nonoverlapping activi￾ties or that the background strain has a modifying influence on
tumor type. In addition, C57BL/6 mice lacking both IFN-γ and
perforin display accelerated B cell lymphoma onset compared with
perforin-deficient mice (5), indicating that IFN-γ has an important
role in modifying the progression to B cell lymphoma in perfo￾rin-deficient mice. IL-12 and IL-18 are important IFN-γ–inducing
cytokines; however, studies of aging have demonstrated that nei￾therIL-12– norIL-18–deficient mice display increased incidence of
tumor development compared with WT mice (5).
A possible link between tumor immunity and autoimmune or
infection-induced inflammation has been raised by several studies.
Curiously,with age, 50% of mice lacking the β2 subunit ofthe IL-12
receptor (IL-12Rβ2) develop plasmacytomas or lung carcinoma in
the context ofthe autoimmune disease immune complex mesangial
glomerulonephritis(10). It is presently unclear why IL-12–deficient
miceonthe same geneticbackgroundasthe IL-12Rβ2–deficientmice
do not display either autoimmunity or spontaneous tumor devel￾opment. Furthermore, mice deficient for both IFN-γ and GM-CSF
have also been found to develop tumorswith age; in this case,tumor
development is associated with acute or chronic inflammatory
lesions in a range of organs, and maintaining mice on the antibi￾otic enrofloxacin prevents(or at least delays) tumor onset (11). Col￾lectively, these findings demonstrate that the immune system can
suppress tumor development, but they do not constitute proof for
tumorimmunoediting perse. The finding that antibiotic treatment
could prevent tumor development in Gm-csf–/–Ifng–/– mice raises the
possibility that rather than directly eliminating tumor cells, the
immune system might preventtumor growth by the timely elimina￾tion of infections, thereby limiting inflammation, which is known
to facilitate tumor development (12). However, this finding cannot
be generalized, as Rag2–/– and Rag2–/–Stat1–/– mice maintained on
the same antibiotics and housed understrictspecific pathogen–free
conditions still display heightened tumor incidence despite testing
negative for common pathogens with known links to malignancy
and showing no signs of idiopathic inflammation (3).
Carcinogen-induced tumors in immunodeficient mice. In orderto more
readily study the role ofthe immune system in shaping tumorigen￾esis,researchers have turned to inducible tumor models, including
carcinogen-induced tumors. The 2 most commonly employed car￾cinogen-induced tumor models are fibrosarcomas induced using
methylcholanthrene (MCA) and skin papillomas induced by a
combination of 7,12-di-methylbenz[a]-anthracene (DMBA) and
12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA). To date, a number
of mice with defined immunodeficiencies have been tested for
their susceptibility to carcinogens (Table 2).
Rag2–/– and SCID mice, both of which lack an adaptive immune
system, display a heightened susceptibility to tumor induction
with MCA (3, 13), and similar findings have been made in nude
mice (14), which lack most T cells. Both αβ and γδ T cells were
subsequently found to be important in suppressing MCA-induced
tumors, as mice deficient for either of these T cell subsets display
increased susceptibility to tumor induction (15). Interestingly,
40% of tumors derived from Rag2–/– mice are rejected when trans￾planted into WT recipients but grow progressively in either Rag2–/–
hosts or mice depleted of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, whereas tumors
derived from WT mice grow readily when transplanted into either
WT or Rag2–/– hosts(3). These observations are important because
they not only show that carcinogen-induced tumors arise more
frequently in immunodeficient mice, but also that tumors derived
from these immunodeficient mice are more immunogenic than
those arising in mice with a functional immune system. CD1d￾Table 1

restricted T cells, which bridge the innate and adaptive arms of
the immune system, also have a role in suppressing MCA-induced
fibrosarcomas. Mice that lack the potential TCR component Jα18
are unable to generate the semi-invariant Vα14-Jα18–containing
TCR expressed by NKT cells and show increased susceptibility to
fibrosarcoma induction (16, 17). Interestingly, similar to immu￾nogenic tumors from Rag2–/– mice, a portion of tumors arising in
mice lacking Jα18 are rejected when transplanted into WT hosts
(18), indicating that they are immunogenic and that the absence
of NKT cells might contribute to the enhanced tumor develop￾ment in Rag2–/– mice. Evidence that the innate immune system
is also important in suppression of MCA fibrosarcomas was pro￾vided in mice chronically depleted of NK cells, since these mice
display increased tumor incidence (16).
To further understand howthe immune system suppressesfibro￾sarcoma growth, a number of mice deficient for specific immune
effector molecules and pathways have been examined, including
mice lacking perforin (19), TRAIL (20), IL-12 (16), IFN-γ (21),
IFNAR1 (a component of the type I IFN receptor) (22), and NK
group 2, member D (NKG2D) (23). Each of these mouse strains
demonstrates enhanced susceptibility to fibrosarcoma induction,
suggesting that cytotoxic cells(NK cells and CD8+ CTLs) use these
pathways to suppress tumor growth in vivo. Interestingly, further
investigation of this phenomenon revealed that tumor cells are
important targets for the antitumor effects of IFN-γ (21), where￾as the host hematopoietic system is the target of the antitumor
effects of type I IFN (22), suggesting that the ability of type I IFNs
to induce antitumor activity in immune cells might be the critical
mode of action for this cytokine family.
This interpretation of the results regarding the role of IFN-γ
in prevention of MCA-induced fibrosarcomas has not been uni￾versally accepted, however, with other researchers proposing that
IFN-γ contributes to an inflammatory response that results in
the encapsulation of injected MCA (a process referred to as a for￾eign body reaction), limiting its spread and thereby reducing its
carcinogenic effects (24). However, the finding that Ifng–/– mice
are more susceptible to lymphomas induced by the soluble car￾cinogen N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (25), where encapsulation of
the carcinogen is not possible, is at odds with this concept. The
finding that restoration of IFN-γ receptor 1 (IFN-γR1) expression
in MCA-induced tumor lines from Ifngr1–/– mice leads to a delay
in tumor growth or complete tumor rejection when such tumors
are transplanted into WT mice also strongly suggests IFN-γ is not
merely a driver for encapsulation of MCA.
A role for the immune system in regulating the development of
DMBA/TPA-inducedpapillomashas also beeninvestigated(Table 2).
With the DMBA/TPA model, skin carcinomas are induced by the
topical application of DMBA (the tumor initiator), followed by
repetitive doses of TPA (the tumor promoter). In this model, lesions
progress from benign papillomas through to metastatic squamous
cell carcinomas, and the number and progression of the lesions
is dependent on the mouse strain. While γδ T cells confer protec￾Table 2

tion from DMBA/TPA-induced papillomas (15), αβ T cells seem to
promote tumor progression in this model of carcinogenesis (26).
One mechanism by which γδ T cells might regulate tumor develop￾ment is through NKG2D recognition of the stress ligand retinoic
acid early transcript 1 (RAE1), expression of which isinduced in the
skin by DMBA/TPA treatment. NKG2D-expressing dendritic epi￾dermal γδ T cells can kill RAE1-expressing targets in vitro (15), but
in transgenic mice expressing RAE1 in the skin, NKG2D expression
is downmodulated on lymphocytes and consequently these mice are
more susceptible to papilloma induction than are WT mice (27).
Collectively these data indicate that the NKG2D pathway is impor￾tant in the control of carcinogen-induced tumors. IL-23 and IL-12
are functionally related heterodimeric cytokines that both contain
the IL-12β subunit (although paired with distinct subunits) and
activate distinct receptors that each contain the IL-12Rβ1 subunit.
Recently, Langowski et al. induced papillomas in mice that lack
eitherthe IL-23–specific subunitthat pairswith IL-12β orthe IL-12–
specific subunit that pairs with IL-12β (28). Interestingly, mice that
lack functional IL-23 are resistant to tumor development, whereas
mice thatlack functional IL-12 develop increased numbers of papil￾lomas comparedwith WT mice. In a broad panel of human tumors,
the authors also found substantial upregulation of the mRNAs
encoding both subunits of IL-23 and hypothesized that expression
of IL-23 in human tumors has a causative role in promoting tumor
development. Although the mechanism by which IL-23 promotes
tumor growth requires further clarification, it has been found
that carcinogen-treated IL-23–deficient mice produce less IL-17 (a
cytokine with tumor growth–promoting activity; refs. 29, 30) than
do WT controls. Moreover,since the DMBA/TPA model of canceris
known to be dependent on a strong inflammatory response, more
work is needed to explore the relative importance of inflammation
versus immunoediting in other primary tumor models and wheth￾er these are distinct or overlapping processes. Tumors induced by
physical carcinogenssuch as UV radiation also seem to be controlled
by the immune system (31), and it is thought that UV-induced
immune suppression is an important factor in the development of
UV-induced tumors, as UV-induced tumors are often immunogenic
when transplanted into naive hosts but growin immunosuppressed
recipients or recipients depleted of CD8+ T cells(32).
Genetic tumor models in immunodeficient mice. Data supporting the
ability of the immune system to suppress tumor development in
genetic models of mouse cancer is less extensive. Several studies
have demonstrated that the immune system can protect mice from
malignancy induced by genetic means, whereas others have shown
no effect(Table 3). Ofthe genetic tumor models, mice heterozygous
for the tumorsuppressor p53 (p53+/– mice) have provided the most
convincing evidence for tumor immune surveillance, indicating a
role for perforin (4),TRAIL (8), and IFN-γR1 (21)in immune control
of tumor development. Transgenic expression of oncogenes under
the control oftissue-specific promoters has become a common tech￾nique to investigate the process of tumorigenesis; however, few of
these studies have addressed the role ofthe immune system in delay￾ing or preventing the development of tumors. A role for IFN-γ in
suppressing tumor development has been observed in mice express￾ing the human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV) type 1–derived onco￾gene Tax under the control of a granzyme B promoter (HTLV-Tax
transgenic mice); these mice develop a lymphoproliferative disease
similartohumanadultTcellleukemia/lymphoma.WhenHTLV-Tax
mice are crossed with Ifng–/– mice, tumor onset is accelerated, sug￾gesting that IFN-γ has a protective effect in this model (33). In a
second transgenic tumor model, using the oncogene encoding the
SV40 large T antigen (Tag), IFN-γ deficiency has no effect on tumor
onset or the spectrum of tumors that develop (34); instead, tumor
growth causes the skewing of T cell responses, with tumor-specific
T cells producing TGF-β rather than IFN-γ. Similarly, CD8+ T cells
have no effect on tumor development in the rat insulin promoter–
Tag4 (RIP-Tag4) pancreatic tumor model, where Tag is expressed
in the pancreas under the control of RIP, resulting in the develop￾ment of pancreatic tumors (35). These results again confirm that
the role of the immune system in suppressing tumorsislikely to be
dependent on the natural history of the individual tumor and the
oncogenic changes that it has acquired.
Summary of mouse models. In summary, various celltypes, including
αβ and γδTcells,NKTcells, andNKcells, have been implicated in the
processes of elimination and immunoediting, along with a number
of effector molecules, including perforin and TRAIL, and cytokines,
including IFN-γ, type I IFNs, and IL-12. It is important to note that
the effector cells and cytokinesthoughtto be involved in elimination

and immunoediting differ among models, demonstrating that the
success of immunoediting and the evidence of its occurrence varies
among experimentalsystems. Indeed, there are modelsin which the
immune system seems to have little influence on the rate of tumor
onset or progression (34) and models in which the immune system
has a distinct protective role,such asthe carcinogen-induced tumor
models outlined above.The level ofimmune regulationand tolerance
(a state of nonresponsiveness to specific antigens) imparted by the
tumors in each of these models might explain, at least in part, why
in some cases the effect of subtracting immune elements on tumor
progression isless overt.Blocking these tolerance mechanisms might
reveal the true mechanisms of tumor suppressor immunity. There￾fore, to date, observations in mouse models are an indirect readout
oftumor elimination, and it has not yet been possible to observe the
establishment and subsequent immune-mediated regression (i.e.,
elimination) of an autochthonoustumor.
Evidence forthe equilibrium phase oftumorimmunoediting, dur￾ing which the tumor and antitumor immune response coevolve, is
least advanced and again indirect.MCA-induced fibrosarcomasfrom
mice lacking IFN-γ, IFNAR1, TRAIL, or T cells aswell aslymphomas
from mice lacking perforin can be eliminatedwhen transplanted into
immunocompetent recipients but grow progressively when trans￾planted into mice of the same genotype as that in which they arose.
These data suggest that the immune system sculpts the immuno￾genic profile of evolving tumors, the exact processthought to occur
during the equilibrium phase of immunoediting. In contrast to the
equilibrium phase, abundant evidence exists for the escape phase of
immunoediting (see below), and the growth of tumors in immuno￾competent hosts is the most basic evidence that tumors can escape
immune control. More specific evidence for the escape phase comes
from studies in which an abortive, concurrent antitumor immune
response is detected in mice with progressive tumor growth.
Evidence for cancer immunoediting in humans
Anumber of clinical observationshaveprovidedevidence supporting
the notion oftumorimmune surveillance in humans. The increased
risk oftumor developmentin immunosuppressed patients, instanc￾es of spontaneous tumor regression, and the appearance of tumor￾reactiveTcells and B cellsin relation to improved prognosis all point
to a role for the immune system in suppressing tumor growth.
Immunosuppressed patients. Immunosuppression (caused by either
primary or secondary immunodeficiencies) and therapy to prevent
transplant rejection are often associated with a heightened risk of
malignancy. Immunosuppression to prevent transplant rejection is
clearly associated with a heightened risk (3- to 100-fold increase) of
developing certain types of malignancy (36). These diseases are pre￾dominantly lymphomas; however, a range of solid tumors with no
known viral association also occurwith increased frequency (36, 37).
In addition to these tumors in patients receiving immunosuppres￾sive drugs, a number of tumors (especially lymphomas) also occur
commonly in patientswith primary and acquired immunodeficien￾cies; however, these are generally thought to have a viral etiology
(37). Perhaps a more convincing argumentthat cancerimmunoedit￾ing does not occurin individualswho are immunosuppressedwould
be if preexisting, dormant tumors grew after immunosuppression
commenced or if an existing tumor regressed following withdrawal
of immunosuppression. No studies have yet addressed these issues
in depth. In summary, although evidence from immunosuppressed
patients supports the theory of immunoediting, further investiga￾tion in this area is warranted, asthe contributions of viral infection,
cytotoxic drugs, and persistent inflammation to tumorigenesis in
thissetting must also be taken into consideration.
Microsatellite unstable human tumors. Some tumortypes exhibit a par￾ticular type of genetic instability referred to as microsatellite insta￾bility (MSI), where defects in DNA mismatch repair mechanisms
lead to the duplication or deletion of short repeated sequences of
DNA known as microsatellites. Immunoediting seems to have an
importantrole in controlling genetically unstable colorectaltumors
in particular (38, 39). The infiltration of colorectal cancer cell nests
by CD8+ T cells is associated with a favorable prognosis (40), and
this association is further strengthened in cases where tumors
exhibit high levels of MSI (MSI-H) (38, 39, 41). Strikingly, MSI-H
tumors are often strongly infiltrated with lymphocytes, including
activated CD8+ T cells(41), and lymphoid follicles are often present
(39), indicative of a potent local immune response. The high rate of
mutation in MSI-H tumors has been shown to result in the genera￾tion of a number of novel tumor antigens that can be recognized
by B cells (42), CD4+ T cells (43), and CD8+ T cells (42). Together,
these findingssuggestthatthe generation of antigenic peptides as a
result of genomic instability mightresultin the priming of a protec￾tiveCD8+ T cell–mediated immune response in patientswith MSI-H
colorectal cancers. Interestingly, this finding might not be unique
to colorectal cancers, as gastric medullary cancers,which frequently
exhibit MSI-H (41.2% of cases), are more prominently infiltrated
with lymphocytes than are nonmedullary gastric cancers, which
rarely display a MSI-H phenotype (1.6% of cases) (44). This trend
has also been observed in a study ofresectable pancreatic cancer(45)
and in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (46).
Human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Tumorinfiltration by T cells,
NK cells, or NKT cells has been associated with an improved prog￾nosis for a number of different tumor types (2, 47–49). However,
tumor infiltration by some leukocytes, such as macrophages and
Tregs, can have a detrimental impact on tumor progression. An
association between favorable patient prognosis and tumor-infil￾trating lymphocytes(TILs)wasfirst observed in patientswith mela￾noma (47, 48), where it was shown that patients with high levels of
CD8+ T cell infiltration survive longer than those whose tumors
contain low numbers of lymphocytes. Since then, various mela￾noma-specific antigens have been identified, and the presence of
melanoma-specific T cellsrecognizing a range of different antigens
has been confirmed in various studies (reviewed in ref. 49). Taken
together, these studies indicate that melanoma TILs are often
tumor specific but respond to a wide range of different antigens.
However, it is important to note that the presence of melanoma￾specific CTLsin the blood is not predictive ofsurvival, although the
presence ofsuch cells among TILs can be an indicator of enhanced
survival in patients undergoing immunotherapy (50).
The plasma cell malignancy multiple myeloma (MM) might also
be a system in which immunoediting can be evaluated in a clinical
setting (51). The advantage of studying MM is that several stages of
disease have been identified, and disease progresses from a prema￾lignant state, known as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined
significance (MGUS), through to terminal disease (52). The ability
to detectthis premalignant phase of disease allowsforimmunologic
monitoring to assessthe contribution ofthe immune system to pre￾venting and/orinhibiting progression toMM(53).Intriguingly,such
monitoringhasrevealed thatTcells derived fromthe bone marrowof
patientswith MGUS mountstrong responsesto autologous prema￾lignant cells; these responses are not detected in patients with MM
(53).These findings are consistentwith aTcellresponse holding pre-

malignant cells in check (i.e., equilibrium) followed by the eventual
failure of thisresponse to controlsuch abnormal plasma cell clones,
resulting in the eventual transition to MM (i.e., escape).
Paraneoplastic autoimmune syndromes. In some cases, patients with
tumors experience disease symptomsthat are caused by the presence
of a tumor but are notthe result oflocaltumor growth.These diseas￾es are referred to as paraneoplastic syndromes; if caused by activation
of an immune response specific forself antigens expressed on tumor
cells, they are known as paraneoplastic autoimmune syndromes.
Paraneoplastic autoimmune syndromes may be caused by cross-reac￾tivity between the antitumorimmune response and neurologic anti￾gens, and the onset of neurologic symptoms often precedes diagnosis
of a previously undetected tumor.Interestingly, certain paraneoplas￾tic autoimmune syndromes are associated with particular tumor
types and particular autoantibodies (54), and the fine specificity of
the antineuronal antibodiesfound in patientsis often related to the
type of tumor present (55, 56). For example, paraneoplastic cerebel￾lar degeneration (PCD) is a neurologic syndrome that arisesin some
patients with gynecologic malignancies and Hodgkin disease; these
patients typically exhibit high titers of Yo-specific autoantibodies
(in the case of gynecologic tumors) or thioredoxin reductase 1–spe￾cific autoantibodies (in the case of Hodgkin disease) (57). Not only
autoantibodies, butCTLsspecific for antigensshared by tumors and
Purkinje cells have been detected in the blood of PCD patients (58),
and tumorsfrom patients with PCD often show prominent infiltra￾tionwith lymphocytes and plasma cells,which isindicative of a local
immune response at the tumor site. In most cases, PCD is terminal,
and the only patients that generally survive this condition are those
that achieve complete tumor remission in response to therapy, once
again demonstrating that the tumor is the probable driver of the
immune response that is both self and tumorreactive. Interestingly,
PCD symptoms can precede tumor diagnosis by a number of years
(59), indicating that antitumor responses might be primed even by
undetectable, microscopic tumors early in their evolution.Itremains
to be determinedwhetherthe antitumorimmune response substan￾tially delays tumor growth in patients with PCD, and such analysis
islikely to be confounded by the lethality of the disease as a result of
neurologic complications.
Summary of human cancer immunoediting. As is the case for mouse
studies, varying evidence has been gathered supporting each of the
distinct phases of human tumorimmunoediting. The phenomenon
ofspontaneously regressing melanoma lesions accompanied by the
clonal expansion of T cells is presently the strongest evidence for
the elimination phase of cancerimmunoediting in humans(60–62).
Generally speaking, however, cases ofspontaneoustumorregression
are rare, and it is presently unknown why regression is most com￾mon in melanoma. Spontaneoustumorregression accompanied by
lymphocyte infiltration has also been noted for a number of other
tumor types, including basal cell carcinoma (63), malignant lym￾phoma (64), Merkel cell carcinoma (65), mesothelioma (66), lung
carcinoma (67), and congenital fibrosarcoma (68); however,the role
ofthe lymphocyte infiltrate in tumorregression has not been estab￾lished in these cases, and doing so is likely to be difficult due to the
rarity with which such cases are observed.
Clinical evidence supporting the existence of the equilibrium
phase of immunoediting is provided by a number of findings
(53, 69, 70–75). First, the existence of an immune response to pre￾malignant MGUS cells that eventually progress to MM is consis￾tent with the equilibrium phase, with the immune system control￾ling, but not eliminating, MGUS cells that eventually evolve and
progress to malignancy (53). Passive immunization with idiotype￾specific antibody, in conjunction with either cytokine therapy or
chemotherapy, can induce remission in some patients with low￾grade B cell lymphoma; however, tumor cells are not complete￾ly eliminated and can be detected in the blood or bone marrow
for up to 8 years following clinical remission (69). A role for the
immune system in establishing long-term remission has also been
suggested by studies of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia patients
treated with either chemotherapy or chemotherapy combined with
autologous bone marrow transplantation (70).
Clinical evidence suggests that tumors can remain dormant in
patients for many years, and cases of relapse after long periods (at
least 10 years) oftumorremission have been noted (71–73), making
immune control with subsequent escape an intriguing possibility
in these cases. In a similar vein, cases of transmission of tumors
from organ donor to recipient have also been noted (74, 75). In
such cases, it is possible that the tumor was being held under con￾trol by an immunologic mechanism in the donor and that trans￾plantation of the organ into an immunosuppressed host allowed
tumor outgrowth. Once again, although thisis consistent with the
theory oftumorimmunoediting, other explanationsforthe growth
of donor-derived malignancies are possible, such as alterations in
tumor oncogene expression from a common cancer stem cell.
The escape phase isthe best characterized ofthe three in both mice
and humans. For example, the growth of melanomas clearly results
in the priming of a tumor-specific immune response, even though
this response is often insufficient to completely eliminate tumors
(76). Similarly,the antitumorimmune response seen in patientswith
paraneoplastic autoimmune syndromes indicates that an ongoing
immune response is, in many cases, insufficient to control tumor
growth, evenwhen itissufficientto destroy normalselftissues. How
tumors escape immune control is nowan active area ofresearch, and
the number of escape mechanismsreported is everincreasing.
Failure of cancer immunoediting — tumor escape
There is a considerable amount now known about tumor escape. In
some cases it seems that the immune system is incapable of influ￾encing tumor progression, butin many casesitseemsthat although
the immune system prevents or delays tumor growth, it is eventu￾ally overwhelmed or evaded, and the tumor progresses. For example,
tumors driven by expression of Tag develop in immunocompetent
mice, even though the tumors express an antigen that is readily
recognized by the immune system (34). Despite the inability of the
immune system to controlthe growth ofTag-induced tumors, aTag￾specific immune response is often primed; however, this response
declines, is overwhelmed, or is evaded, and tumors eventually prog￾ress. The failure of the immune system to control tumor growth in
Tag-transgenic mice can occur at a number of levels, including the
induction of central or peripheraltolerance.Centraltolerance refers
to the process by which self-reactive T cells are deleted or converted
to a regulatory phenotype in the thymus(77). Clearly, however, cen￾traltolerance failsto eliminate alltumor- and/orself-reactive T cells,
asis evident by the presence of tumor-specific T cellsthatrecognize
nonmutated self antigens (such as those belonging to the cancer/
testis antigen family) in cancer patients(49).
In caseswhere tumor-associated antigens are not expressed in the
thymus, or when T cells specific for tumor antigens escape central
tolerance, tumor growth can induce T cell tolerance in the periph￾ery. Peripheral tolerance can occur through a deletional mecha￾nism, the induction of antigen unresponsiveness, orthe skewing of

T cell functional responses, and evidence for each of these mecha￾nisms has been observed in tumor models (34, 78). Often, immu￾notherapiesthat are able to induce protective responseswhen given
before tumor challenge/onset(thatis, prophylactically) fail against
established tumors (35, 79–81). Importantly, in a number of cases,
although tumor-specific immunity is compromised in tumor-bur￾dened mice, there is often no generalized immune deficiency (82),
indicating that tumors can specifically dampen down the induc￾tion of effective antitumor immunity. Concomitant immunity
is one example where tumor growth clearly primes an antitumor
immune response that ultimately fails to control the tumor’s
growth: a mouse challenged with a given tumor will reject a sub￾sequent challenge with the same tumor at a distant site, despite
the fact that the initial tumor continues to grow (83–85). All of
these examples collectively demonstrate that, in addition to cen￾tral and peripheral tolerance, failure of antitumor immunity can
be the result of factorswithin the localtumor environment. Similar
findings have also been noted in clinical studies (86), and the lack
of appropriate stimulation in the tumor microenvironment might
cause the ineffective responses generated by TILs (87).
Many factors in the tumor microenvironment have been shown
to contribute to tumor escape, including activation of T cellsin the
absenceof appropriate costimulation,resulting inanergy (88); expres￾sion of T cell–inhibitory moleculessuch as B7-H1 (89), HLA-G (90),
and HLA-E (91) by tumor cells; tumor antigen loss or downregula￾tion of MHC molecules(92);the presence of bothCD4+CD25+ Tregs
andCD1d-restrictedT cellsthatsuppress antitumorimmunity (93);
soluble suppressive factors expressed by tumors, such as TGF-b
(94–96), VEGF (97), IL-10 (98), and gangliosides (99); expression of
indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in tumors(reviewed in ref. 100);
tumorresistance to cytotoxic pathways, as observed in tumors with
mutations in the gene encoding FAS (101, 102), mutations in the
gene encoding the TRAIL receptor death receptor 5 (DR5) (103),
and overexpression ofthe antiapoptotic molecules FLIP and BCL-XL
(104, 105); and expansion ofimmunosuppressive myeloid cell popu￾lations(106, 107).In the latter case, expansion ofimmature myeloid
cell populations has been observed in a number of studies and is
associated with profound suppression of T cell responses in both
mice and humans (108, 109). Several tumor-derived cytokines have
now been implicated in the expansion of immature myeloid cells
(iMCs), including VEGF (110), IL-1b (111), and GM-CSF (112). The
mechanism of iMC suppression is complex and seems to involve
contributionsfrom eitheriNOS (also known as NOS2) or arginase 1
(ARG1) (113–115). The signaling pathways activated by these mole￾cules enable iMCsto inhibit T cellresponsesin variousways, includ￾ing induction of apoptosis, inhibition of proliferation, orinduction
of a regulatory phenotype.Type 2 macrophagesfound attumorsites
have also been implicated in suppression of tumor immunity and
seem to share some functional properties with iMCs (116). From
these examplesit can clearly be seen that by generating the appropri￾ate environment, tumors can skew the immune response such that
tumor growth, rather than elimination, isfavored.
Future directions
We are armed with a lot of knowledge from mouse models of can￾cer regarding the various roles played by the immune system in
tumor development; however, immunodeficient humans clearly
have a far greater susceptibility to lethal viruses and pathogens
than do immunocompromised mice in specific pathogen–free
mouse facilities, and therefore the opportunities for observing
increased spontaneous tumor formation in patients with muta￾tions in specific genes encoding immune effector molecules are
few. On the positive side, we might expect to see a wealth of new
human genetic information generated by emerging high-through￾put sequencing techniques, and this might enable a very rapid
assessment of polymorphisms and mutations in immune path￾ways of large cancer patient cohorts that will confirm or deny the
importance of key immune pathwaysin controlling human tumor
development. The value of early detection, predicted risk, and pre￾vention cannot be underestimated in this context.
Itis also importantinthe future to clarifywhichparticularimmune
cells are prognostic for each distinct type of cancer. Gene expression
profiling and proteomics are going to have a key role in defining the
major positive andnegative immune indicators ofhumancancer pro￾gression. More also needs to be understood about the mechanisms
required for the induction of a therapeutically relevant immune
response in humans in the face of tumor escape. Indeed, even in
mice, there is very little information about the extensive and con￾tinual coexistence of tumor cells, hoststromal cell populations, and
infiltrating leukocytes during any particularstage oftumor develop￾ment.Itistherefore importantfortumorimmunologiststo gather a
clearer molecular definition of the tumor microenvironment in real
time, and perhaps only advanced imaging technologieswill allowthe
specific cellularrelationshipsto be properly discerned.
Immunotherapy is potentially synergistic with other treatment
modalities, and approachesthat trigger tumor cell death, alter the
tumor microenvironment, reduce tolerogenic mechanisms, and
stimulate immune responses might act in concert. An improved
understanding of the immunobiology of cancer immunoediting
and a molecular definition of how tumors are shaped by this pro￾cess will undoubtedly bring us closer to a more effective use of
immunotherapy together with other conventional cancer treat￾ments to prevent, control, and/or eradicate established cancer.
