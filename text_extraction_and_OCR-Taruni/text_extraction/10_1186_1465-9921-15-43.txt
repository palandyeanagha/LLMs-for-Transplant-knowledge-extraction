Abstract
Background: Interstitial lung disease occurring in children is a condition characterized by high frequency of cases
due to genetic aberrations of pulmonary surfactant homeostasis, that are also believed to be responsible of a
fraction of familial pulmonary fibrosis. To our knowledge, ABCA3 gene was not previously reported as causative
agent of fibrosis affecting both children and adults in the same kindred.
Methods: We investigated a large kindred in which two members, a girl whose interstitial lung disease was first
recognized at age of 13, and an adult, showed a diffuse pulmonary fibrosis with marked differences in terms of
morphology and imaging. An additional, asymptomatic family member was detected by genetic analysis. Surfactant
abnormalities were investigated at biochemical, and genetic level, as well as by cell transfection experiments.
Results: Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis of the patients revealed absence of surfactant protein C, whereas the
gene sequence was normal. By contrast, sequence of the ABCA3 gene showed a novel homozygous G > A transition at
nucleotide 2891, localized within exon 21, resulting in a glycine to aspartic acid change at codon 964. Interestingly,
the lung specimens from the girl displayed a morphologic usual interstitial pneumonitis-like pattern, whereas the
specimens from one of the two adult patients showed rather a non specific interstitial pneumonitis-like pattern.
Conclusions: We have detected a large kindred with a novel ABCA3 mutation likely causing interstitial lung fibrosis
affecting either young and adult family members. We suggest that ABCA3 gene should be considered in genetic
testing in the occurrence of familial pulmonary fibrosis.

Introduction
Pulmonary surfactant, a lipid-protein complex, is synthe￾sized, packaged, and secreted by alveolar type II cells. The
lipid portion constitutes approximately 90%, whereas the
protein portion constitutes approximately 10% by weight
of pulmonary surfactant. The latter is primarily composed
of four surfactant-associated proteins (SP-) A, B, C and D.
An important component in surfactant metabolism is the
ATP binding cassette member A3 (ABCA3), a transporter
protein that is thought to be involved in the inward trans￾port of phospholipid into lamellar bodies. Approximately
half of the alveolar surfactant pool is cleared through a
GM-CSF-dependent alveolar macrophage pathway. Most
of the remaining surfactant is then taken up by type II epi￾thelial cells and transported to the lamellar body, while a
portion is degraded in the respective lysosomes [1].
Mutations in the genes for surfactant proteins have been
associated with interstitial lung diseases (ILD). Interest￾ingly, ILD associated with mutations in SFTPC and
SFTPA genes usually occur later in infancy or in adult￾hood, while ILD associated with mutations in SFTPB and
ABCA3 genes generally consist of respiratory failure in
term newborns [2,3]. Of interest, patients with rare muta￾tions in SFTPA2 have been described in familial lung
fibrosis [4].

More than 150 distinct mutations have been identified
in the ABCA3gene, making this the largest class of mu￾tations that cause genetic abnormalities in surfactant
metabolism. Lung disease caused by ABCA3 mutations is
an inherited autosomal recessive disorder, requiring muta￾tions on both alleles. However, a significant fraction of re￾ported cases are compound heterozygous resulting in
variable expression in the neonatal period or in infancy [3].
The clinical spectrum and severity of lung disease
caused by ABCA3 deficiency is extremely variable,
strongly depending on the mutations found and the
patho-morphological pattern induced. The majority of
patients with ABCA3 mutations exhibit severe respira￾tory distress and failure in the neonatal period or in in￾fancy [5-7]. Lamellar bodies are abnormally small and
dense, with eccentrically placed inclusions creating a
characteristic “fried egg” appearance, and result in bio￾chemically abnormal surfactant that is dysfunctional [8].
Here, we provide evidence for a familial clustering of
ILDs associated with a novel homozygous ABCA3 gene
mutation; affected family members exhibited a variety of
interesting clinical, radiological, and cellular features.
Materials and methods
Subjects
All members of the family described here were enrolled
in a study protocol focused on identifying the genetic
cause of ILD that affected some members of this family,
which is from Italian origin.
As control groups for the determination of gene vari￾ant frequency, 242 healthy individuals (lab staff and
blood donors), 30 patients with pulmonary alveolar pro￾teinosis (PAP) and 113 patients with idiopathic pulmon￾ary fibrosis (IPF), all of Italian descent, were enrolled.
The diagnosis of PAP was established by the presence of
typical “crazy paving” pattern on chest high-resolution
computed tomography (HRCT) and consistent morph￾ology confirmed with a lung biopsy, or bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid (BALF). Autoimmune PAP was defined on the
basis of a positive test result for serum auto antibodies
anti GM-CSF (GMAb). GMAb levels were measured by
ELISA on patients’ sera which were previously collected
and stored frozen (−20°C), as previously reported [9].
For the IPF patients, enrolment criteria included those
described in the international consensus documents (ATS/
ERS 2002), appropriate clinical picture coupled with a sur￾gical lung biopsy or HRCT findings consistent with UIP
(usual interstitial pneumonia) were required. No IPF pa￾tient has a positive family history. Ethical implications and
confidentiality were discussed with family members; all in￾dividuals gave written informed consent before entering
the study, which was approved by the ethical committee of
the institutions involved. The ethical committee approved
the use of human tissue for this investigation.
Pulmonary function testing
When indicated, subjects were tested for FEV1/FVC,
FVC,VC, single-breath diffusing capacity of carbon mon￾oxide (DLCO), and arterial blood gases at rest and
exercise.
Genetic analysis
Genomic DNA was extracted from EDTA whole blood
or dried blood spots (DBS) with the DNA Mini Kit®
(Qiagen). DNA from IPF patients was extracted from
paraffin embedded tissue specimens with the NucleoS￾pin Tissue kit (Machery-Nagel) according to the manu￾facturer’s protocol. After identification of the ABCA3
Gly964Asp mutation in the proband, genomic DNA of the
parents and siblings was examined if available. ABCA3
Gly964Asp SNP detection was performed with the Taqman
Assay on a Light cycler 480 (Roche), with the following
primers and probe: forward primer: AGGTCCCGGGA
ACTGAGAA, reverse primer: CCATGCTGAGGCTGAC
CTT, reporter 1: VIC-CGAGTACGGCAGAACC, reporter
2: FAM-CGAGTACGACAGAACC, quencher: NFQ. In
heterozygous and homozygous samples, each of the 30
coding exons of the ABCA3 gene including the donor and
acceptor splice sites was amplified by PCR using exon spe￾cific primers [10], located in the flanking intronic regions
and sequenced by direct sequencing using a CEQ8800 sys￾tem (Beckman Coulter).
The five coding exons of SFTPC and the exon–intron
boundaries were analyzed by direct DNA sequencing of
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products using specific
primers as previously described [11].
Bioinformatic analysis
Sequences were analysed using BioEdit software (7.0.5.3
version) and compared with the reference sequences
NM_001089, for the ABCA3 gene, and NM_003018.3,
for the SFTPC gene. Multiple sequence alignment was
performed with the ClustalW software. For predictive
analysis of mutation effects, the web-based tool FANS
(Functional analysis of novel SNPs and mutations in hu￾man and mouse genomes) was used [12].
Western blot analysis
Total protein content was determined with the BioRad
Protein Assay Kit (BioRad, Richmond, CA, USA). Four
BALF (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) samples containing
5 μg total protein each were prepared to detect Pro-SP-B
and Pro-SP-C under reducing and SP-B and SP-C under
non-reducing conditions. The proteins were separated
on NuPage 10% Bis-Tris gels using a Novex X-cell II
Mini Cell system (Novex, San Diego, CA, USA) and then
transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes by Western
Blot in Nupage Blot modules (Novex, San Diego, CA,
USA). Membranes with proteins separated under reducing

conditions were first incubated with pro-SP-B-antibody
(recombinant anti-human from rabbit, C-terminal, charge
1/24/00, from Guttentag, USA), SP-C-antibody (recom￾binant anti-human from rabbit, charge 22/96, from
Byk-Gulden, Konstanz, Germany), SP-B-antibody (recombin￾ant anti-human from rabbit, charge C 329, from Byk-Gulden,
Konstanz, Germany) and pro-SP-C-antibody (recombinant
anti-human from rabbit, N-terminal, from Beers, USA).
As second antibody we used horseradish peroxidase
(HRP) conjugated goat Ig-G anti-rabbit from DIA￾NOVA, Hamburg, Germany. The membranes were acti￾vated with the enhanced chemiluminescence assay before
exposing them to x-ray films (Hyperfilm ECL, Amersham
Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). After development,
films were scanned with the FluorSMulti-Imager and bands
were analyzed using the software-program "Quantity One".
In addition to the qualitative evaluation, a quantitative ana￾lysis was performed by multiplying the optical density with
the average diameter of each band. Comparison with stand￾ard curves allowed approximate determinations of the
amount of SP-B and SP-C in each patient sample [13]. HA￾Tag, EEA1, calnexin, BiP and β-Actin in non-transfected
and transfected A549 cells were detected by western
immunoblot as previously described [14]. The following
antibodies were used: primary antibodies, rat anti-HA-tag
(Roche), rabbit anti-EEA1 (Acris Antibodies), rabbit anti￾BiP (Cell Signaling), goat anti-calnexin (Santa Cruz); sec￾ondary antibodies, goat anti-mouse, goat anti-rabbit and
rabbit anti-goat IgG antibodies (Dianova), conjugated to
HRP; anti-β-Actin antibody (Santa Cruz), conjugated to
HRP.
Histochemistry
Hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides of lung surgical biop￾sies from patients A and B were available. Histopathological
specimens were examined by pulmonary pathologists from
other institutions and reviewed by the pulmonary patholo￾gist at our center.
ABCA3 Gene expression analysis
Total RNA was isolated from blood collected in PAX
Gene RNA Tubes (PreAnalytix). Messenger RNA was
reversed transcribed into complementary DNA with
ThermoScript RT-PCR (Invitrogen) and used to measure
messenger RNA expression levels relative to house-keeping
β-actin mRNA (Human ACTB Gene Assay, Roche). Real
Time PCR analysis was performed on a LightCycler 480
(Roche, Mannheim, Germany), by using two independent
assays (assay 27 and assay 62). The primers for the
real-time PCR assays were: 27 F (ccttcgtggacctgacctt),
27R (gctttctccagaataccgaaaa), used in combination with
UPL (Universal Probe Library) #27 (Roche), and 62 F
(gccagttccccagtagtcct), 62R (ttgctcagctccacactcat) used
in combination with UPL #62 (Roche). The primer set
62 F/R was localized at the beginning (nucleotides 332 to
403, NM_001089.2 sequence) and 27 F/R at the end of
ABCA3 mRNA (nucleotides 5598 to 5718, NM_001089.2
sequence). All PCR experiments were conducted in tripli￾cate with reactions taking place in a final 10 μl volume, by
adding the following: 0.2 μl forward primer (200 nM),
0.2 μl reverse primer (200 nM), 0.2 μl UPL probe, 5 μl
LightCycler 480® Probe Master, 0.2 μl reference primer
(Human ACTB Gene Assay, Roche), 0.2 μl reference
probe (Human ACTB Gene Assay, Roche), 1 μl water, 3 μl
cDNA diluted 1:50.
The “Advanced Relative Quantification” analysis pro￾vided by the LightCycler 480®software was used to gen￾erate reliable results, in terms of concentration ratio
target/reference.
Total RNA was isolated from transfected cells using
the High Pure RNA Isolation Kit (Roche). 1 μg of total
RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the
QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen). Quanti￾tative real time PCR was performed with the iQ™SYBR®
Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and the following primers:
ABCA3-for 5’-CGGGAAGACCACGACTTT-3’, ABCA3-
rev 5’-GCTGCCGCACCTTTC-3’, HPRT-for 5’-CATTGT
AGCCCTCTGTGTGC-3’ and HPRT-rev5’-CTGACCAA
GGAAAGCAAAGTCTG-3’ in an I-cycler real time PCR
machine (Bio-Rad). Relative changes in ABCA3 mRNA
expression were calculated using the 2-ΔΔCT method
after normalization to the housekeeping gene hypoxan￾thine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT).
Plasmids
pUB6-ABCA3 vectors were constructed as previously
described [15]. The ABCA3-G964D point mutation was
introduced into the pUB6-ABCA3-WT vector using the
Quick Change Site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene)
with the following primers: G964D-for 5’-GCGAGTAC
GACAGAACCGTCGTG-3’ and G964D-rev 5’-CACGAC
GGTTCTGTCGTACTCGC-3’.
Cell culture
The human A549 epithelial cell line was obtained from
DMSZ (German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell
Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany). Cells were main￾tained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS.
For all experiments, cells were seeded into 12-well plates
and transfected with pUB6 vectors at 70% confluence
with ExGen 500 (Fermentas). In mock-reactions, trans￾fection reagent without plasmids was used. Cells were
harvested 48 h after transfection.
Human HEK cell line was obtained from DMSZ. Cells
were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with
10% FBS. For stable transfection, cells were seeded into
12-well plates and transfected with pEYFP-hABCA3 vectors
at 70% confluence with ExGen 500. 24 h after transfection,

selection was started by addition of 500 μg/ml G418. After
reaching confluence, cells were singled out from the wells
of a 96-well plate. Stable clones were selected by YFP fluor￾escence and western blot signal. For experiments, stable
cells were seeded onto 12-well plates with or without cover￾slips and cultured for 72 h, at 37°C, 5% CO2.
Immunofluorescence staining
Cells grown and transfected on 15×15 mm cover slips
were fixed with 4% PFA, permeabilized with Triton-X
100 and stained with rat anti-HA-Tag (Roche), mouse
anti-CD63 (LAMP3) (Chemicon) or goat anti-calnexin
(Santa Cruz) primary antibodies. Alexa Fluor® 488 donkey
anti-rat IgG (H + L), Alexa Fluor® 555 donkey anti-mouse
IgG (H + L) and Alexa Fluor® 555 F(ab')2 fragment of goat
anti-mouse or anti-goat IgG (H + L) secondary antibodies
(Invitrogen) were used to visualize the signal. Coverslips
were viewed with a Zeiss Axiovert 135 microscope and
images were recorded with a Zeiss AxioCam MR camera
and the Axiovision 3.1 software.
Electron microscopy
Cells were fixed in 150 mM HEPES, pH 7.35, containing
1.5% formaldehyde and 1.5% glutaraldehyde at room
temperature for 30 min and then at 4°C over night. After
dehydration in acetone cells were embedded in EPON.
50 nm sections were stained with 4% uranyl acetate and lead
citrate [16] and observed in a Morgagni TEM (FEI). Images
were taken with a 2 K side mounted Veleta CCD camera.
Lipid analysis of cultured cells
Cells were extracted in the presence of not naturally
occurring lipid species as internal standards and crude
lipid extracts were quantified by direct flow injection
electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI￾MS/MS) in positive ion mode [17,18]. Lipid species were
annotated according to the shorthand notation of lipid
structures [19]. Results are presented as total phospho￾lipids or free cholesterol, expressed as nmol/ml.
Statistics
Comparisons of multiple groups were made using one￾way repeated measure ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc
test, comparisons of two groups were made using the
students t-test. Results are presented as mean + S.E.M.
from a minimum of three different experiments. All tests
were performed using GraphPad Prism 4.0 (GraphPad
Software). P-values of less than 0.05 were considered sta￾tistically significant.
Results
Patient A (the proband)
A 16 year-old, girl who never smoked was referred to
the IRCCS Policlinico S. Matteo hospital for ILD causing
a progressive exertional dyspnoea associated with digital
clubbing. The patient medical history indicated that by
the age of 2 years, pulmonary aspiration was suspected
as a consequence of gastroesophageal reflux and sliding
hiatal hernia; this was confirmed by pH-metry, contrast
radiography analysis and gastroscopic examination. By
the age of 4, her HRCT showed bronchi with thick walls
and small bronchiectasis. One year later, ventilation￾perfusion lung scintigraphy revealed a perfusion defect
involving both upper lobes. By the age of 13, a chest
HRCT scan revealed diffuse ILD characterized by a fine
reticular pattern alternating with areas of normal lung
tissue and some areas with irregularly distributed small
sized bullae. BAL revealed numerous lipid-laden macro￾phages, whereas lung function testing showed a restrict￾ive syndrome (Table 1) with a marked reduction in
DLCO. A diagnosis of PAP was suspected and the pa￾tient was referred to our center. The chest HRCT
showed fibrotic ILD, with an atypical pattern, character￾ized by features of IPF/UIP, fibrotic NSIP, and centrilob￾ular fibrosis (Figure 1). The ILD was predominant in the
upper lobes, with relative sparing of the lower lobes. The
serum GMAb test was negative and the serum LDH
level was within the normal range. A VATS (Video￾Assisted Thoracic Surgery) lung biopsy revealed pulmon￾ary fibrosis with a UIP pattern (Figure 2). To investigate
whether the condition was associated with surfactant ab￾normalities, hydrophobic surfactant proteins were ana￾lyzed by Western blotting of BALF. A small amount of
pro-SP-B was detected, whereas SP-B was detected in fair
amounts. No aberrant proforms of SP-C were detected,
but importantly, no SP-C was detected (Figure 3). Clinical
course: the patient is currently in follow up, and in stable
conditions. Cycles of low dose prednisone and macrolides
at anti-inflammatory doses have been administered.
Genetic analysis
Sequence analysis of all 30 coding exons of the ABCA3
gene revealed the presence of a novel homozygous G > A
transition at nucleotide 2891, localized within exon 21,
resulting in a glycine to aspartic acid change at codon
964 (Figure 4). Bioinformatic analysis of this mutation
identified a high risk associated with the A allele, which
putatively causes the abolishment of a protein domain.
A search for this ABCA3 mutation resulted negative
in 195 Italian healthy individuals, in 30 Italian patients
with autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, and
113 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (data not
shown). Both parents and two siblings of the proband were
heterozygous for this ABCA3G/A mutation (Figure 5).
They had no symptoms or signs of ILD. Interestingly, the
parents disclosed a history of consanguinity, being second￾degree blood relatives. On that basis, we extended the gen￾etic analysis to another 18 members of the family. Figure 4
Campo et al. Respiratory Research 2014, 15:43 Page 4 of 15
http://respiratory-research.com/content/15/1/43

shows the pedigree of the family: we identified 10 ABCA3
G/A heterozygous carriers and 6 ABCA3 G/G homozy￾gous carriers. Medical history and analysis of these 16 fam￾ily members did not reveal any clinical abnormalities; all
had normal pulmonary function test results (Table 1) and
chest X-rays. Interestingly two subjects (herein after re￾ferred as patients B and C) were homozygous for the
ABCA3 Gly964Asp mutation.
Sequence analysis of SFTPC coding exons detected
two common non-synonymous polymorphisms: rs4715
heterozygous C/A and rs1124 homozygous AA, inside
exon 4 and exon 5 respectively (Table 2). In patient A, B
and C, no mutation was detected in SFTPA and SFTPB
gene sequence; moreover the long PCR of SFTPC gene
did not reveal any large deletion (data not shown).
In all tested subjects, including patients B and C, the
serum GMAb test was negative.
Patient B
Patient B was a 57 year old male, non-smoker. In 2005, at
the age of 52, he started to complain of cough and dys￾pnea on exertion. Chest X-ray showed bilateral areas of
interstitial thickening. After several cycles of antibiotic
therapy which proved ineffective, a HRCT scan of the
thorax was performed, revealing a bilateral patchy intersti￾tial fibrosis associated with diffuse ground glass opacities,

the latter prevailing on the fibrotic component. Minimal
apical honeycombing was also present.
The pulmonary function test showed a mild restrictive
syndrome with marked reduction in DLCO (49% pre￾dicted). Gas exchange at rest was normal. The 6MWT
(six Minutes Walking Test) showed reduced tolerance to
physical exertion in hemoglobin oxygen desaturation.
Collagen-vascular diffuse lung disease was excluded and
in February 2006 the patient underwent a VATS lung bi￾opsy, revealing interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, suggestive
of collagen vascular disease or hypersensitivity pneumo￾nia, characterized by areas of interstitial scarring in an
otherwise uninvolved alveolar background. The patient
was then referred to our center, and lung specimens
were reviewed. In most lobules, fibrosis was limited to
the centrilobular areas; however complete scarring of
some lobules was observed in the subpleural region. In
the centrilobular areas, lesions of variable severity were
observed, spanning from simple lymphocytic infiltration
of the submucosa of terminal bronchioli, to inflamma￾tory infiltrates associated with mild fibrosis, limited to
the bronchiolar walls, to severe bronchiolar scarring and
fibrosis of the alveolar septa surrounding the small air￾ways associated with peribronchiolar metaplasia and
mucus plugging. The fibrosis was dense, eosinophilic
and homogeneous. Portions of the lobules not involved
in the scarring were unremarkable. Membranous bron￾chi showed lymphocytic infiltrates and mild submucosal

from the upper lobe (a, b) shows limited architectural changes, with centrilobular inflammation and fibrosis. Fibroblastic foci and small aggregates
of multinucleated giant cells engulfing cholesterol clefts are visible in centrilobular areas. Granular pink material is visible in some alveolar spaces

scarring. Sparse interstitial lymphocytic infiltrates were
present (Figure 6). When consanguinity with patient A
was disclosed, the ABCA3 gene was sequenced and
homozygosity for the Gly964Asp mutation was identi￾fied. Western blot analysis of BAL fluid detected no pro￾SP-B and low SP-B levels (53 ng/ml). No SP-C was
detected.
The patient has been in follow up at our center for the
last five years, treated with low dose prednisone and low
dose azitromycin, with minimal progression of lung
function impairment. The last HRTC scan showed the
disappearance of ground-glass areas with persistence of
fibrosis (Figure 7a,b).
Patient C
Patient C, brother of patient B, was a 52-year old, mild
former smoker, who did not complain of respiratory
symptoms and, interestingly, his ILD was diagnosed fol￾lowing the genetic analysis.
His clinical history was remarkable for acute myocar￾dial infarction, treated with coronary revascularization
three years before. The chest X-ray taken at that time
was considered within normal limits. Pulmonary func￾tion testing documented normal lung volumes (Table 1),
but with a marked reduction in DLCO (56% of pre￾dicted). The 6MWT showed reduced exercise tolerance
with oxyhemoglobin desaturation.
We did not perform any invasive diagnostic procedures,
because of the patients’ chronic ischemic cardiac disease.
His HRTC chest scan revealed a pattern very similar to
that found in his brother, with areas of reticular ground
glass opacities and initial honeycombing (Figure 7c,d). Par￾enchymal abnormalities had a bilateral and asymmetrical
distribution, with a clear separation between preserved and

Gene expression analysis
To determine the effect of the ABCA3 G > A transition at
nucleotide 2891 on gene transcription, we performed a Real
Time PCR relative quantification analysis by using two in￾dependent assays. We analysed ABCA3 mRNA from three
healthy subjects with ABCA3 GG genotype, four GA het￾erozygous subjects and the two ABCA3 AA homozygous
brothers. No differences in mRNA levels between heterozy￾gous, non-mutated and mutated homozygous subjects were
detected in peripheral blood (mean concentration ratios
target/reference were 0.42, 0.50, 0.46, respectively with
assay #62 and 0.16, 0.17,0.20, respectively with assay #27).
Expression, intracellular processing, and cellular effects
resulting from ABCA3 G > A transition at nucleotide 2891
Transient transfection of A549 cells with DNA coding for
ABCA3-WT and ABCA3-G964D induced ABCA3-mRNA
transcription 500 to 600-fold compared to non-transfected
cells (Figure 8a). Protein concentrations of HA-tagged
ABCA3 in ABCA3-WT and ABCA3-G964D transiently
transfected A549 cells were similar (Figure 8b). Intracellu￾lar processing as assessed by western immunoblotting did
not differ between ABCA3-WT and p.G964D, both pro￾teins were found to have a 150 kDa as well as a larger
190 kDa processing form (Figure 8b). The ratio of
upper to lower bands was not significantly different in
ABCA3-WT and p.G964D cells (Figure 8c). Immunofluor￾escence staining of transfected A549 cells revealed a
mostly vesicular ABCA3 pattern, which colocalized with
the lamellar-body marker LAMP3 for both HA-tagged
ABCA3-WT and G964D proteins (Figure 8d). This is in
concordance with the native localization of ABCA3 in the
outer membrane of lamellar bodies in alveolar type II cells.
Almost no colocalization was observed for ABCA3-WT
and p.G964D with the ER-resident chaperone calnexin, so
ER-retention due to protein-misfolding can be excluded
(Figure 8e). Expression of the p.G964D mutation did
not induce the early-endosomal marker (EEA1), the ER
chaperone calnexin or the ER-resident stress marker BiP￾when compared with the ABCA3-WT protein (Figure 8f ).
Similar results for the intra-cellular processing and the
lack of induction of ER stress were obtained with stably
transfected HEK cells with DNA coding for ABCA3-WT
and ABCA3-G964D (Additional file 1: Figure S1).
The G964D mutation decreases ABCA3-induced intra￾cellular accumulation of phospholipids and free choles￾terol in HEK cells.
Phospholipids and cholesterol were determined in
HEK cells stably transfected with vectors coding for
ABCA3-WT and G964D. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) was
the most abundant phospholipid (approximately 50% of
total phospholipids), while phosphatidylinositol (PI), phos￾phatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and sphingomye￾lin were present in smaller amounts. Cellular content

of PC, phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and PI were signifi￾cantly increased in cells expressing wild type ABCA3
when compared to G964D stably transfected HEK cells
(Figure 9).
Electron microscopy of both stably transfected WT
and G964D HEK cells possessed organelles which
resemble lamellar bodies (Figure 10). Whereas these
organelles appeared in different states of organisation,
G964D transfected HEK had less mature and more
variable appearing organisation of the organelles than
the WT.
Taken together, these results suggest that transport
function of ABCA3 with the G964D mutation is severely
impaired especially with regard to the sorting of import￾ant surfactant phospholipids and FC, as well as quality
of lamellar body formation.
Discussion
An increasing body of evidence suggests that inherited
or acquired disorders associated with the surfactant sys￾tem may result in the development of ILD, either acute
or chronic. Among the different genes involved in these
processes, the ABCA3 gene encodes a 1704 amino acid
protein of the ATP binding cassette transporter family.
It is mainly expressed in the lungs at the limiting mem￾brane of the lamellar bodies of alveolar type II cells; loss

of normal ABCA3 function is associated with lung dis￾ease [20,21].
There is a wide spectrum of mutations in the ABCA3
gene, with more than 150 described so far. Some muta￾tions correlate with forms of severe respiratory distress
in newborns and death within the first months of life,
whereas other mutations are associated with milder clin￾ical forms, such as ILD, desquamative interstitial pneu￾monitis or NSIP presenting in childhood [1]. A compound
heterozygous mutation involving a substitution of valine
for glutamic acid in codon 292 (E292V) on at least one al￾lele has been identified in children with chronic ILD.
These children survived well beyond infancy and in one
case to early adulthood. The onset of symptoms in the
majority of these patients was at birth, in the neonatal
period, or in infancy (<1 year), with histopathologic diag￾noses of PAP or DIP [5].
Compound heterozygous mutations in ABCA3 have
also been identified in adults with chronic ILD, as well
as in one adolescent patient who presented at age 15
with a 6-month history of exercise intolerance, chest dis￾comfort, and histologic features of UIP [22]. ABCA3 may
also act as a modifier gene for the phenotype associated
with an SFTPC mutation, as heterozygosity for ABCA3
mutations in severely affected infants with SFTPCI73T
leads to more severe lung disease than family members
with only the I73T mutation [23]. Recently a full-term
baby girl, who developed severe chronic lung disease and
eventually became ventilator-dependent via tracheotomy,
was reported [24]. Sequence analysis revealed that the
patient was a homozygous carrier of the loss-of-function
mutation p.Trp308Arg (c.922 T > C) at exon 9 of the
ABCA3 gene, without any additional abnormalities in
SFTPB, SFTPC and CSF2RA genes.
The ABCA3 G964D mutation identified in our pa￾tients has never been described previously and it shows
an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, as sug￾gested by evidence that lung disease develops only in

homozygous carriers. The ABCA3 G964D mutation was
not detected in a large control group of healthy subjects,
thus it is unlikely that it is a polymorphism, but rather a
rare variant. Recently, Flamein et al. [25] reported a case
where an infant died from neonatal respiratory distress,
which carried a ABCA3 G964S mutation in compound
heterozygosity with a L462R mutation. Together with
the fact that aminoacid G at position 964 is conserved in
many species, this suggests that this position is critical
for correct function of the protein. When we performed
the pedigree analysis we took into account the high de￾gree of inbreeding that characterized this family. From
this point of view, consanguinity was implicated in the
susceptibility to familial ILD, with cousin marriages shar￾ing the same predisposing allele inherited from a common
ancestor. Patients with a hereditary ABCA3 deficiency do
not share a typical histopathological pattern. It has been
suggested that histology patterns of diffuse lung disease in
pediatric cases differ from those of adults. The reported fi￾brotic evolution of ABCA3 pediatric lung disease [26]
could in part support the hypothesis that the different pat￾tern observed in our patients correspond to different
phases of the disease evolution, as suggested by the pres￾ence of similar histological features in less affected areas
in patients A and B. On the other hand, the evidence of a
more advanced disease stage in the younger patient (pa￾tient A) contradicts this hypothesis.
To the best of our knowledge, only one other case of
an adolescent patient with an UIP pattern of pulmonary
fibrosis associated with an ABCA3 mutation has been
described [22]. Our patient A exhibited a similar distri￾bution of pulmonary lesions with prevalence in the upper
lobes and relative sparing of the lower lobes. These fea￾tures are actually in contrast with the HRCT scan pattern
of common UIP/IPF, which is typically characterized by
predominant lower lobe involvement, with peripheral/sub￾pleural honeycombing and reticular opacities.
In marked contrast, the histology pattern observed in
patient B was characterized by a patchy fibrotic process,
with NSIP-like lobular scarring, while the HRTC scan of
both adult patients (B and C) shared a very similar pat￾tern, with areas of reticular ground glass opacities and
initial honeycombing. They were both diagnosed at a
much older age, and the morphology and radiology fea￾tures are consistent with a milder form of disease.
In an attempt to further elucidate the consequences of
the ABCA3 mutation on surfactant metabolism and in
turn the development of ILD, we designed a series of ex￾periments based on a cell culture model system for al￾veolar epithelial cells. Transient cellular expression of
wild type and mutated G964D ABCA3 in alveolar epi￾thelial cells resulted in enhanced expression of normal
and mutated protein which did not differ in size and
molecular form, intracellular processing or localization

magnification. The boxed area is shown in the top image as inset in higher magnification. Note the concentric arrangement of the lamellae in
the ABCA3-WT strain. Dark appearing lamellae are mostly wound around a centre of less electron density and appear as parallel lines in the high
magnification. In the strain G964D these organelles appear less organized: lamellae are often not arranged perfectly parallel (see inset), and the
concentric organisation is not as distinct as in the WT.
Campo et al. Respiratory Research 2014, 15:43 Page 12 of 15

into lamellar body like structures. No differential reten￾tion in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was observed
and the extent of expression of ER or early endosome
stress markers was not different, suggesting no abnor￾malities were induced by the mutation in the folding
and assembly of these proteins in the ER or their sorting
to late endosomes and lysosomes. Similar results on
ABCA3 expression, intracellular processing and the lack
of induction of ER-stress were obtained for stably trans￾fected HEK-293 T cells.
The substrates believed to be transported by ABCA3,
i.e. phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol, were substan￾tially enriched in HEK cells expressing wild type ABCA3
in comparison to non-transfected cells, demonstrating
induction of ABCA3 specific activity with transfection of
the transporter into the cells (data not shown). This result
resembles findings from A549 cells expressing GFP-tagged
ABCA3 [27]. We further demonstrated reduced level of
the lipids characteristic for pulmonary surfactant, i.e. phos￾phatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol
and free cholesterol, in those cells that carried the
G964D – ABCA3. In accordance with these results it was
also shown previously that phosphatidylcholine accumula￾tion in cells expressing ABCA3 with the walker A motif
mutant N568D was diminished [27]. However, in A549
cells, no increased free cholesterol levels have been ob￾served. Accumulation of free cholesterol due to expression
of ABCA3 in HEK cells is in line with the free cholesterol
transport activity that has been reported for ABCA3 [28].
By electron microscopy lamellar bodies, as characteristic
in type II alveolar epithelial cells in the lungs, were clearly
induced and visualized in both stably transfected WT and
G964D HEK cells. However G964D cells appeared to have
a more variable and less mature organisation of these or￾ganelles than the WT. This finding is concordant with the
functional transport defect for phosphatidylcholine, phos￾phatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol and free cholesterol
observed in the cells carrying the G964D – ABCA3 muta￾tions and described above.
Therefore, based on these cell culture data, disordered
lipid composition, reduced and faulty lamellar body
organization due to the G964D – ABCA3 mutation may
represent mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis on
ILD in this family, whereas misfolding, aberrant process￾ing, mislocalization and ER-stress can be excluded as
factors contributing to the development of ILD by the
G964D mutation. However, as discussed below, ER stress
seems not to be mandatory for an epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) in ABCA3 mutation- associated ILD: ac￾cumulation of lipid species, as happening in ABCA3 im￾pairment, might per se induce EMT [29].
Onset and progression of ABCA3-related ILDs might be
influenced by external stress factors such as respiratory
infections. Several respiratory viruses, as well as other
viruses, especially Epstein-Barr Virus and Herpesvirus-8,
have been implicated in ILD exacerbation [30]. Recently,
Kaltenborn and coworkers [29] demonstrated that respira￾tory syncytial virus (RSV), one of the most common re￾spiratory pathogens in infants, children and adults, could
substantially drive a pulmonary epithelial cell pheno￾type into a fibroblast like phenotype, particularly in
cells harboring ABCA3 mutations and infected by RSV.
In those cells they observed alterations in cell morph￾ology, loss of epithelial cell properties and function,
and gain of mesenchymal, fibroblast-like characteristics
suggesting that a genetic predisposition of epithelial
cells, due to ABCA3 mutations, creates a permissive
environment for the development of EMT, a process
believed to play a central role in the development of
pulmonary fibrosis.
As it is known that ILD induced by SFTPC mutations
in children [5] and in adults [31] may be aggravated by
ABCA3 mutations present in a heterozygous state, we
hypothesized that alterations in SFTPC might have con￾tributed to disease severity. We found two common
non-synonymous SFTPC polymorphisms rs4715 (C/A
Thr138Asn) and rs1124 (G/A Ser186Asn) in patient A,
which are in strong linkage disequilibrium [32]. Thus we
cannot exclude that the different presentation of the dis￾ease in patient A in comparison with patients B and C
was due to the presence of these SFTPC variations
(Table 2).
The BALF analysis of our patients demonstrates the
lack of mature SP-C in alveolar spaces, which could be a
further consequence of abnormalities in the lamellar
bodies resulting from ABCA3 mutations. Mature SP-B
and precursors of SP-C are delivered together with lipids
by multivesicular bodies to lamellar bodies and subse￾quently secreted into the alveolar space after final pro￾teolytic remodeling of the N-terminal SP-C propeptide
[33]. This process may be impaired by ABCA3 defects.
Bioinformatic analysis of the homozygous ABCA3 muta￾tion suggested unaffected transcription levels of the
gene, however with abolishment of a protein domain. In
fact each aminoacid has its own specific size, charge,
and hydrophobicity-value. The original wild-type residue
and newly introduced mutant residue differ in these
properties. The mutant residue is bigger than the wild￾type residue. The wild-type residue was neutral, the mu￾tant residue is negatively charged. The wild-type residue
is a glycine, the most flexible of all residues. This flexi￾bility might be necessary for the protein's function. Mu￾tation of this glycine can abolish this function. It is
possible that the residue is needed at this position to
make a special backbone conformation or to facilitate
movement of the protein. The mutation introduces a
less flexible residue thereby disturbing this conformation
or movement. Although little is known about the role of
Campo et al. Respiratory Research 2014, 15:43 Page 13 of 15
http://respiratory-research.com/content/15/1/43

this domain for ABCA3 routing and function, the
change of glycine to aspartic acid in the transporter
could result in severely impaired phospholipid transport
function which in turn could affect surfactant processing
and contribute to the development of ILD in this family.
Familial interstitial pneumonia has emerged as a distinct
clinical phenotype [34,35], characterized by an underlying
pulmonary transcriptional profile markedly different from
that of sporadic fibrosis [36]. The search for mutations in
known candidate genes, including SFTPA2, SFTPC [37]
and genes encoding for telomerase components (TERT,
TERC) accounts for approximately 22% of these cases
[38]. In contrast, in sporadic fibrosis, only 3–4% of cases
are estimated to be caused by these genes. Moreover very
recently the ATP11A gene, which encodes for another
ATP-binding cassette transporter, has been identified as a
risk factor for fibrotic idiopathic interstitial pneumonias in
a genome-wide association study on 1616 cases [39]. In
spite of the limitations of this paper, including the poor as￾sessment of the family members (related to their domicile
very far from Pavia), we believe that our results would
demonstrate that ABCA3 mutations must be considered
additional candidates that may cause familial fibrosis and
thus we suggest that ABCA3 be included in genetic test￾ing in cases of familial pulmonary fibrosis.
