This article discusses current understanding of myocardial biology, emphasizing the regeneration potential of the 
adult human heart and the mechanisms involved. In the last decade, a novel conceptual view has emerged. The 
heart is no longer considered a postmitotic organ, but is viewed as a self-renewing organ characterized by a resident 
stem cell compartment responsible for tissue homeostasis and cardiac repair following injury. Additionally, HSCs 
possess the ability to transdifferentiate and acquire the cardiomyocyte, vascular endothelial, and smooth muscle 
cell lineages. Both cardiac and hematopoietic stem cells may be used therapeutically in an attempt to reverse the 
devastating consequences of chronic heart failure of ischemic and nonischemic origin.
Introduction
Our understanding of the process of myocardial regeneration is 
currently under debate. Although the adult human heart is no 
longer considered a static organ unable to replace its parenchy￾mal cells during the course of life, the rate of myocyte regener￾ation reported thus far varies dramatically. Minimal levels of 
myocyte turnover, which decrease with age, have been claimed 
(1–5), but results have also been obtained supporting continu￾ous myocyte renewal at a remarkable degree (6–12). Indepen￾dent from the extent of the process, the debate is further inten￾sified by contrasting views regarding the origin of newly formed 
cardiomyocytes (13, 14). These issues have important implica￾tions because knowledge of the magnitude of cell regeneration 
and the mechanisms involved may offer a novel dynamic per￾spective of cardiac homeostasis and myocardial biology. This 
information is critical for the identification of strategies aim￾ing at the restoration of the functional and structural integrity 
of the failing human heart.
The recognition that the adult heart harbors a compartment 
of multipotent c-kit–positive cardiac stem cells (CSCs) (15–23) 
and other progenitor cell classes (24–29) capable of differenti￾ating into cardiomyocytes and coronary vessels has raised the 
challenging question concerning their embryologic origin and 
role in cardiac cell turnover and regeneration. CSCs are stored in 
interstitial structures with the characteristics of stem cell niches 
and can divide symmetrically and asymmetrically, with the abil￾ity to self-renew and form a committed progeny (17, 21, 30). But 
whether this stem cell pool is actually self-autonomous and fully 
distinct from HSCs in the bone marrow remains to be deter￾mined. c-kit–positive HSCs transdifferentiate and acquire the 
myocyte, endothelial cell, and smooth muscle cell lineage (31), 
suggesting that the bone marrow participates in the homeostatic 
control of the myocardium and the restoration of myocytes and 
coronary vessels following injury. Additionally, the possibility has 
been advanced that postmitotic myocytes dedifferentiate, acquire 
an immature cell phenotype, and then reenter the cell cycle and 
divide (32–35), representing an alternative or complementary 
modality of myocyte formation. In this Review, we discuss CSCs, 
HSCs, and myocyte dedifferentiation as potential mechanisms of 
myocardial regeneration in the adult organ physiologically and in 
the presence of pathologic states.
CSCs
The shift in paradigm dictated by the discovery of c-kit–positive 
CSCs has been difficult for the field to accept. The recognition 
that myocyte regeneration, mediated by activation and lineage 
specification of endogenous CSCs, is an important determinant 
of cardiac homeostasis and tissue repair was received with skep￾ticism. Studies suggesting a limited role of myocyte renewal in 
animals and humans (2, 36) were highly publicized with accompa￾nying editorials neglecting CSC function and reiterating the lim￾ited nature of myocyte replacement in the adult heart (37, 38). The 
simple concept of a requisite equilibrium between myocyte death 
and renewal physiologically has often been ignored.
Myocyte apoptosis in the normal human heart involves at least 
1 in 100,000 cells (39). Considering that apoptosis lasts at most 
4 hours, 0.006% of myocytes are lost per day, which accounts for 
a decrease of 2.2% of myocytes per year. Moreover, myocyte apop￾tosis increases linearly with age, so that over a period of 30 years 
approximately 95% of the original ventricular myocytes are lost 
as a result of wear and tear of the organ (12). This magnitude of 
cell death does not include cell necrosis, which has recently been 
documented independently by the presence of cardiac troponin in 
the circulation of apparently healthy individuals (40, 41). There￾fore, a level of myocyte regeneration significantly higher than that 
predicted by the extent of cell apoptosis is required to preserve 
cardiac mass and function.
Following the discovery of c-kit–positive CSCs (15), several addi￾tional, distinct CSC classes have been described, including ISL1 
progenitors, epicardial progenitors, side population progenitors, 
Sca1 progenitors, progenitors generating cardiospheres, and 
mesenchymal stem cells (24–27, 29). This unusual number of CSC 
categories is in sharp contrast to the properties of all other self-re￾newing organs in the organism, in which a single tissue-specific 
adult stem cell has been found. By definition, stem cells possess 
well-defined growth properties, suggesting that it is unrealistic 
that the heart contains such a variety of primitive cells all perform￾ing the same biologic function.
Among the different progenitor cell subsets, the c-kit–positive 
CSC has been well characterized in the mouse (42), rat (15), dog 
(16), and human (17, 21) heart. The expression of the stem cell anti￾gen c-kit is associated with a pool of undifferentiated cells that have 
essentially identical properties in vitro and in vivo and are indis￾tinguishable among species. Typically, stem cells reside in niches 
(30), where they are structurally connected to the supporting cells 
by gap and adherens junctions made by connexins and cadherins,

respectively (Figure 1A). The niche constitutes the microenviron￾ment within which stem cells retain their undifferentiated state 
and receive growth signals from the supporting cells (43, 44). Fol￾lowing growth activation, stem cells divide symmetrically or asym￾metrically, generating new stem cells and cells destined to acquire 
specialized functions; c-kit–positive CSCs self-renew, form mul￾ticellular clones, and give rise to a differentiated progeny in vitro 
and in vivo (Figure 1B). By employing viral transduction for clonal 
tracking of individual mouse and human CSCs, their fate in vivo 
has been determined (42). The clonality and multipotentiality of 
c-kit–positive CSCs (Figure 1C) was demonstrated in physiological 
conditions and following myocardial injury.
This extensive work has provided strong evidence in support of 
the notion that the adult heart possesses a class of c-kit–positive 
CSCs that modulates organ homeostasis and conditions tissue 
repair. During physiological myocardial aging in humans, from 20 
to 100 years, the growth and differentiation of c-kit–positive CSCs 
replaces the entire myocyte compartment approximately 12 times 
(12). Similarly, activation and myocyte specification of c-kit–pos￾itive CSCs occurs in response to myocardial infarction (MI) and 
chronic aortic stenosis in humans (7, 9, 10). The crucial role of 
resident c-kit–positive CSCs in the turnover of cardiomyocytes in 
the adult rat and mouse heart has also been shown (30, 42, 45).
The recurrent statement made against the presence of resident 
CSCs and the significant growth reserve of the human heart is 
that spontaneous cardiac repair does not occur after infarction 
and that necrotic tissue is not restored by intact myocardium (14); 
instead, the healing process results in a thick scar. There is validity 
in this comment because it describes correctly the progression of 
MI and the need for cell therapy with appropriate cells that repair 
a non-contracting scar with functionally competent cardiomyo￾cytes and coronary vessels. However, a lack of endogenous regen￾eration after infarction is present in organs including the skin, 
liver, intestine, kidney, and bone marrow. In all cases, occlusion 
of a supplying artery leads to scar formation, mimicking cardiac 
pathology (46–50). In the case of polyarteritis nodosa and vascu￾litis, microinfarcts develop in the intestine, and skin and resident 
stem cells do not repair the damaged tissue (51). Infarcts of the 
bone and bone marrow occur with sickle cell anemia, but HSCs 
and mesenchymal stromal cells do not reconstitute the structural 
integrity of the organ (46, 49). The simplest example is provided 
by the occlusion of a branch of a mesenteric artery; a segmental 
infarct of the intestine develops rapidly, but viable stem cells of 
the crypts fail to regenerate necrotic tissue (52). The stem cell 
compartment appears to be properly equipped to regulate tissue 
homeostasis but does not respond effectively to ischemic injury or, 
late in life, to aging and senescence of the organ (Figure 2).
Some comments must be made concerning the ISL1-positive 
cardiac progenitor that has been argued to represent the mas￾ter human heart stem cell (27, 53). The cardiomyocyte specifi￾cation dictated by the expression of ISL1 defeats the inclusion 
of ISL1-positive cells into the category of stem cells. As recently 
stated, adult stem cells are undifferentiated, long-lived cells that 
have the capacity to self-renew and give rise to a differentiated

progeny (54). ISL1-positive cells are not clonogenic, forming at 
best small, abortive colonies in vitro, and their functional impor￾tance in vivo remains to be shown. ISL1-positive cells are restricted 
to the embryonic fetal heart and are not present after birth (55), 
raising questions about their relevance to the treatment of heart 
disease in children and adults. Similar limitations apply to the 
other categories of cardiac progenitors; whether they regulate car￾diac cell turnover physiologically and promote tissue repair fol￾lowing myocardial injury has not been documented as of yet. At 
present, the c-kit–positive CSC is the only candidate that fulfils 
the criteria of tissue-specific adult stem cell (54, 56).
Lineage tracing has been viewed as the gold standard for rec￾ognizing the properties of stem cells (57). With this approach, 
the expression of a fluorescent reporter gene is placed under the 
control of promoters coding for myocyte and vascular proteins 
to track the origin of cells and their destiny in animals in which 
genetic manipulations can be routinely performed (Figure 3). 
Unfortunately, this protocol cannot document whether stem 
cells divide asymmetrically, i.e., self-renew, or whether the labeled 
progeny derive from activation of a single or several stem cells, i.e., 
unipotency or multipotency (13, 42, 58, 59). Additionally, results 
from fate-mapping strategies cannot be taken at face value. Fate 
mapping indicates that no myocyte renewal in the mouse heart 
occurs up to 1 year of age (36), despite continuous myocyte death 
by apoptosis and necrosis (45, 60). This conclusion is in stark con￾trast to pulse-chase labeling studies with thymidine analogs and 
mathematical modeling of hierarchically structured cell popula￾tions, both of which document constant formation of new myo￾cytes (12, 30, 42, 45). Most importantly, lineage-tracing protocols 
cannot be implemented in humans.
HSCs
The recognition that CSCs reside in the adult myocardium poses 
the question of their origin and mechanisms of growth activation. 
CSCs may be present early during development and be responsible 
for cardiomyogenesis in embryonic and fetal life, a role that may 
continue postnatally and into adulthood. Conversely, these undif￾ferentiated cells may be located in distant organs, in particular the 
bone marrow, and continuously translocate to the developing and 
mature heart, where they assume specific functions, leading to the 
formation of the mature cardiac phenotype during development 
and to the preservation of tissue homeostasis in the adult organ.
Recent results favor the notion that cardiac development is con￾trolled mainly by growth and differentiation of c-kit–positive CSCs, 
which are largely responsible for the formation of the myocyte 
progeny present at birth (61). Spontaneous Ca2+ oscillatory events 
that occur within CSCs promote cell cycle reentry and asymmetric 
stem cell division (61, 62). HSCs appear not to be an important 
determinant of cardiomyogenesis, but the possibility that the bone 
marrow contributes partly to the maturation of the embryonic, 
fetal, and neonatal heart cannot be excluded. Similarly, bone mar￾row–derived cells are involved in the adaptive response of the adult 
heart following ischemic and nonischemic myocardial injury (63, 
64), although the magnitude of the process is currently unknown.
The possibility that HSCs are involved in the restoration of 
damaged myocardium and contribute to the cardiac repair pro￾cess suggests that bone marrow–derived cells are capable of form￾ing cardiomyocytes and coronary vessels in spite of their prede￾termined lineage specification. During prenatal life, stem cells 
undergo a hierarchical progressive restriction of developmental 
options, and this mechanism of embryonic specification was 
thought to be irreversible and inviolable in adulthood (65, 66). 
However, this notion has been challenged by several examples of 
transition from one cell type to another or, more unexpectedly, 
from one cell lineage to another lineage (67–70). The unantici￾pated plasticity of adult HSCs to generate cells beyond their own 
tissue boundary became the driving force of a series of studies 
in which HSCs were implemented experimentally to restore the 
necrotic myocardium after infarction (71–78).
The notion that HSCs transdifferentiate and form cardiomyo￾cytes and coronary vessels has been sharply attacked, and criti￾cisms have been made, regarding the implementation of this form 
of cell therapy in human beings (79–82). However, based on posi￾tive results obtained in phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials (83, 84),

different classes of bone marrow cells are currently being used 
in patients with acute and chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy. A 
phase 3 trial supported by the European Union is ongoing (BAMI; 
http://www.euram.ltd.uk/BAMI/). But whether the apparent ben￾efit of bone marrow–derived cells is dictated by the ability of these 
cells to regenerate damaged myocardium is the subject of intense 
debate. The predominant view is that these cells secrete a variety of 
cytokines that activate endogenous progenitors, which are actually 
responsible for the repair process and the improvement in ventric￾ular function (82). Unfortunately, the documentation of the para￾crine effects mediated by bone marrow cells in animals has been 
elusive at best, and data in humans have not helped to resolve this 
conundrum. Findings have been reported that support the notion 
that HSCs acquire the myocyte lineage and differentiate into func￾tionally competent cardiomyocytes (75, 85), strengthening the view 
that HSCs may have therapeutic import for the human disease 
by acquiring the myocyte and endothelial cell lineage (Figure 4). 
Despite animal and human results, myocardial repair continues to 
be viewed with suspicion and trepidation. The traditional view of 
the ability of the heart for proliferative growth was defined as “on 
shadings between none and almost none” (86), whether it derives 
from activation of resident CSCs or HSCs.
Myocyte dedifferentiation
Myocytes with decreased myofibrils and expansion of the undif￾ferentiated cytoplasm have been found in pathological cardiac 
hypertrophy (9), idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC), and 
acute MI (7, 35) and in the presence of hibernating myocardium 
(87). Partial loss in the normal distribution pattern of titin, 
desmin, and cardiotin has been reported, together with the reex￾pression of fetal genes, including α-smooth muscle actin, atrial 
natriuretic peptide, α-skeletal actin, and α-smooth muscle actin 
(35, 87). Cardiomyocytes with these structural characteristics 
have been interpreted as the product of cell dedifferentiation, 
resulting in the acquisition of an immature proliferative cell phe￾notype. Dedifferentiation of adult cardiomyocytes has also been 
claimed following inhibition of p38 MAPK (32), myocardial injec￾tion of the extracellular matrix component periostin (33), or the 
growth factor neuregulin (34), although the effect of periostin on 
myocyte replication in vivo has been challenged (88).
Myocytes essentially identical to those commonly involved in the 
prenatal and early postnatal development of the myocardium (89, 
90) reappear in the diseased human heart, and this process may be 
mediated by the release from macrophages of a member of the IL-6 
inflammatory cytokines, oncostatin M (35). Surprisingly, divid￾Figure 3

promoter coding for a stem cell–specific protein. Following differentiation and loss of stem cell antigen, myocytes, ECs, and SMCs continue to

of one or several stem cells, failing to document the multipotency of the parental stem cell. (B) Representation of viral gene tagging. Infection 
of CSCs with EGFP lentivirus results in the semirandom insertion of the proviral integrant in the genome of the recipient cell. Transcription and 
translation of the viral DNA result in expression of EGFP and fluorescent labeling of the infected CSCs. The unique insertion site of the viral 
genome is inherited by the entire population derived from the parental cell and can be amplified by PCR. CSCs nested in atrial and apical niches 
were labeled in situ to identify their progeny in vivo. (C) Four distinct clones were identified in EGFP-tagged CSCs, ECs, fibroblasts (Fbl), and 
cardiomyocytes (Myo) isolated from the ventricle of one mouse heart. Multiple PCR products (bands in agarose gel) were identified. Bands of 
the same molecular weight correspond to identical sites of integration of the proviral sequence in the host genome of CSCs, myocytes, ECs and 
fibroblasts, documenting the multipotency of CSCs in vivo. Reproduced with permission from Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences

ing myocytes repeatedly observed in IDC and acute and chronic 
MI in humans (6, 7, 10) have not been detected (35). Addition￾ally, enhanced delivery of oncostatin M by macrophages in an in 
vivo model of dilated cardiomyopathy or following MI recapitu￾lates the fetal-neonatal cell program but fails to promote myocyte 
regeneration (35), questioning the mechanisms involved in the 
negative (dilated myopathy) and positive (MI) effects of myocyte 
dedifferentiation on ventricular remodeling and cardiac hemody￾namics. Similarly, the dedifferentiated cardiomyocytes identified 
in the human heart with IDC or acute MI never reached karyoki￾nesis or cytokinesis. The expression of the fetal gene program with 
hemodynamic overload may simply reflect regenerated myocytes 
derived from commitment of resident CSCs rather than dediffer￾entiation of terminally differentiated postmitotic myocytes, which 
acquire an unwanted, mechanically inefficient cell phenotype (13).
Oncostatin M has also been argued to reverse in vitro the struc￾tural organization of postmitotic myocytes, resulting in the 
upregulation of several stem-related genes, including c-kit (35). 
Although the c-kit protein was never identified and the potential 
contamination of culture preparations from resident c-kit–pos￾itive progenitor cells was not excluded, a reinterpretation was 
immediately offered for the data on c-kit–positive CSCs (91). In 
the absence of in vivo findings, and despite the disclaimer from 
the authors, the validity of multiple demonstrations of resident 
c-kit–positive CSCs (15–23) was challenged (91). The rationale for 
this scientific view is obscure at best.
Recently we tested whether fetal myocytes, obtained from mice 
at E16–E18 expressing EGFP under the control of the c-kit pro￾moter, were able to dedifferentiate and reacquire a degree of stem￾ness, including the expression of c-kit (61). A total of 102 myo￾cytes in mitosis were examined and none showed EGFP labeling. 
Moreover, non-dividing fetal myocytes expressing different levels

of sarcomeric proteins were all EGFP negative, excluding cell ded￾ifferentiation. Importantly, the generation of myocytes by dedif￾ferentiation of mature cells, if it occurs, would have a minor role 
in physiological cell renewal, being restricted to cardiomyocytes 
(Figure 5). Similarly, dedifferentiated myocytes would be severely 
limited in their ability to sustain or improve ventricular perfor￾mance following injury. Myocytes in the absence of adequate vas￾cular supply and tissue oxygenation would be mechanically ineffi￾cient. Conversely, CSCs are multipotent and form in a coordinated 
manner cardiomyocytes and coronary vessels, fundamental com￾ponents of myocardial repair.
Future directions
Endothelial progenitor cells, mononuclear bone marrow cells, 
mesenchymal stromal cells, and CD34-positive cells have been 
administered to patients suffering from acute MI or chronic ische￾mic cardiomyopathy (83, 84). Based on meta-regression analyses, 
these interventions have had positive outcomes, documenting 
the feasibility and safety of this therapeutic strategy and, in most 
cases, the beneficial effects on cardiac function. An average signifi￾cant increase in ejection fraction of 3 percentage points has been 
reported (83, 84), although studies have also been published that 
indicate no changes in ejection fraction (92–96). Although enroll￾Figure 5

ment is ongoing for a large clinical trial to test the effect on mortal￾ity of the delivery of mononuclear bone marrow cells (BAMI; http://
www.euram.ltd.uk/BAMI/), the documentation of tissue-specific 
adult CSCs offers an alternative and theoretically more effective 
form of cell therapy for patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). 
Based on this premise, a phase 1 clinical trial with autologous CSCs 
is in progress (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00474461), and the prelimi￾nary results are encouraging (97). Additionally, difficulties do not 
appear to exist in the acquisition of small myocardial samples in 
humans or in the isolation and expansion of CSCs in quantities 
that can be employed therapeutically and repeatedly over time (98).
However, multiple variables may negatively affect the growth 
reserve of resident CSCs in the aging, decompensated heart, lim￾iting their regenerative potential (99–101). The amplification in 
vitro of c-kit–positive human CSCs yields a cell population com￾posed of stem cell subsets with considerably different ability to 
divide and differentiate. The association of c-kit with distinct 
membrane receptors conditions the phenotypic plasticity of CSCs 
and their ability to form mechanically efficient cardiomyocytes 
(101). Aging is associated with a progressive decrease in the com￾partment of human CSCs with high regenerative potential, and 
with a progressive increase in the pool of stem cells with mini￾mal or no ability to divide (12, 99–101). The loss of CSC function 
with aging is mediated partly by an imbalance between factors 
promoting growth and survival and factors enhancing oxidative 
stress, telomere attrition, and apoptosis. However, a small pool 
of CSCs with significant growth reserve persists in the senescent 
and decompensated heart (12, 98, 102). Two growth factor recep￾tor systems have a critical role in CSC replication, differentiation, 
senescence and death: the IGF1/IGF1 receptor system and the 
renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The IGF1/IGF1 receptor induces 
CSC division, upregulates telomerase activity, maintains telomere 
length, hinders replicative senescence, and preserves the popula￾tion of functionally competent CSCs in animals (45) and humans 
(101). The expression of IGF1 receptors and the synthesis of IGF1 
are attenuated in aging CSCs, possibly diminishing the ability 
of IGF1 to activate cell proliferation and interfere with oxidative 
damage and telomeric shortening (60).
The documentation that a local RAS is present in human CSCs 
and that formation of Ang II and expression of Ang II receptors 
increase with age provides evidence in favor of the role that this 
octapeptide has in CSC senescence and death. Ang II generates 
reactive oxygen species, resulting in DNA damage; 8-OH-deoxy￾guanosine (8-OH-dG) accumulates at the GGG triplets of telo￾meres, resulting in telomeric shortening and uncapping (103). 
Conversely, IGF1 decreases oxidative stress (60) and repairs DNA 
damage by homologous recombination (104). Therefore, changes 
in the proportion of these growth factor receptor systems in 
CSCs influence their growth reserve, a critical determinant of 
stem cell–based therapy.
Importantly, CSCs cannot be implemented in acute events in 
view of the time required for their preparation, whereas mono￾nuclear bone marrow cells constitute an appealing form of cell 
intervention. Mononuclear bone marrow cells can be easily col￾lected from bone marrow aspirates or the peripheral blood upon 
their mobilization from the bone marrow with cytokines. How￾ever, mononuclear bone marrow cells should not be confused 
with c-kit–positive HSCs that constitute a minute fraction of 
the mononuclear bone marrow cell pool (105). Experimentally, 
remarkable levels of myocardial regeneration after infarction 
have been obtained with c-kit–positive HSCs (71, 72, 75, 85) but 
not with mononuclear bone marrow cells (106). At present, it is 
unknown whether CSCs and HSCs are similarly effective in recon￾stituting the necrotic and scarred tissue, or whether limitations 
exist in CSC growth and HSC transdifferentiation, resulting in 
inadequate restoration of the damaged myocardium. A funda￾mental question to be answered is whether CSCs are superior, 
equal, or inferior to HSCs for the regeneration of myocytes and 
coronary vessels in animal models of CHF.
The therapeutic efficacy of these two stem cell classes depends 
on their ability to survive in the hostile milieu of the damaged 
heart, to engraft within the myocardium, and to grow and dif￾ferentiate. HSCs may have a growth potential that is superior to 
CSCs, but transdifferentiation could affect this characteristic, 
and CSCs may constitute a more powerful form of therapy for 
cardiac repair. The process of transdifferentiation may alter the 
growth behavior of HSCs, which may lose in part their capability 
of dividing through alterations of the telomere-telomerase sys￾tem, premature cellular senescence, and apoptosis. The opposite 
may also be true, and HSCs may retain after transdifferentiation 
a stronger regenerative capacity than CSCs. However, with HSCs, 
the newly formed myocytes have fetal-neonatal properties and may 
not reach the adult phenotype, a problem that may not affect the 
commitment of CSCs. Understanding the biology of HSC trans￾differentiation and the molecular control of CSC growth and lin￾eage commitment is a challenging and exciting endeavor due to 
the extraordinary clinical importance of myocardial regeneration 
for patients affected by acute MI and CHF.
