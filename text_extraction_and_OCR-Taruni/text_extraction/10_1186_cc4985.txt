Abstract
Introduction Patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure show
an aggravated hyperdynamic circulation. We evaluated, in a
controlled manner, potential changes in systemic
haemodynamics induced by the molecular adsorbent
recirculating system (MARS) and the Prometheus system liver
detoxification devices in a group of patients with acute-on￾chronic liver failure.
Methods Eighteen patients (51.2 ± 2.3 years old; Child–Pugh
score, 12.5 ± 0.2; Maddrey score, 63.1 ± 5.0; hepatic venous
pressure gradient, 17.6 ± 0.9 mmHg) with biopsy-proven
alcoholic cirrhosis and superimposed alcoholic hepatitis were
either treated with standard medical therapy (SMT) combined
with MARS (n = 6) or Prometheus (n = 6) or were treated with
SMT alone (n = 6) on three consecutive days (6 hours/session).
Liver tests, systemic haemodynamics and vasoactive
substances were determined before and after each session.
Results Groups were comparable for baseline haemodynamics
and levels of vasoactive substances. Both MARS and
Prometheus decreased serum bilirubin levels (P < 0.005 versus
SMT), the Prometheus device being more effective than MARS
(P = 0.002). Only MARS showed significant improvement in the
mean arterial pressure (∆change, +9 ± 2.4 mmHg versus -0.3 ±
2.4 mmHg with Prometheus and -5.2 ± 2.1 mmHg with SMT, P
< 0.05) and in the systemic vascular resistance index (∆change,
+131.5 ± 46.2 dyne.s/cm5/m2 versus -92.8 ± 85.2 dyne.s/cm5/
m2with Prometheus and -30.7 ± 32.5 dyne.s/cm5/m2 with SMT;
P < 0.05), while the cardiac index and central filling remained
constant. This circulatory improvement in the MARS group was
paralleled by a decrease in plasma renin activity (P < 0.05),
aldosterone (P < 0.03), norepinephrine (P < 0.05), vasopressin
(P = 0.005) and nitrate/nitrite levels (P < 0.02).
Conclusion The MARS device, and not the Prometheus device,
significantly attenuates the hyperdynamic circulation in acute￾on-chronic liver failure, presumably by a difference in removal
rate of certain vasoactive substances. These findings suggest
conspicuous conceptual differences among the albumin dialysis
devices.
Introduction
The natural course of chronic liver disease is often compli￾cated by acute episodes of potentially reversible decompen￾sation, triggered by a precipitating event such as infection or
upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and is frequently referred to
as acute-on-chronic liver failure (AoCLF) [1-3]. This complica￾tion is associated with a further aggravation of the systemic
haemodynamic dysfunction associated with portal hyperten￾sion, also called the hyperdynamic state. The hyperdynamic
state is characterized by a reduced systemic vascular resist￾ance and mean arterial pressure (MAP), as well as an
increased cardiac index, heart rate and total plasma volume.
AoCLF = acute-on-chronic liver failure; FPSA = fractionated plasma separation, adsorption, and dialysis; MAP = mean arterial pressure; MARS = 
molecular adsorbent recirculating system; NO = nitric oxide; NOx = nitrite/nitrate; RRT = treatment phase percentage reduction rate; SMT = standard 
medical therapy; SVRI = systemic vascular resistance index.

The pathophysiology is still incompletely understood but an
overload of endogenous vasodilatory substances, including
nitric oxide (NO), are presumed to play a major role [4-6]. The
combination of vasodilatation and expanded intravascular vol￾ume is associated with abnormal distribution of the plasma vol￾ume with hypervolaemia in the splanchnic region (splanchnic
hyperaemia) and other noncentral vascular territories, while
relative hypovolaemia prevails in the central thoracic compart￾ment. Sensor mechanisms interpret this relative central hypo￾volaemia as a reduced effective circulating volume, which
results in an activation of endogenous vasoconstrictor and
water-retaining and sodium-retaining systems such as the
renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system and the sympathic
nervous system, and in the nonosmotic release of arginine
vasopressin. Persistent activation of these systems appears to
worsen the increased intrahepatic resistance, thus playing a
central role in the aggravation of portal hypertension, and pro￾motes vasoconstriction with ischaemia in essential organs,
which may lead to the development of the hepatorenal syn￾drome, portopulmonary hypertension and, finally, multiorgan
failure [6-10]. Several studies have emphasized the relation
between the degree of arterial hypotension in cirrhosis and the
severity of portal hypertension, hepatic dysfunction, signs of
decompensation and survival [8,11,12].
AoCLF is at present managed by treating the precipitating
event and offering supportive therapy for end-organ dysfunc￾tion in the hope that liver function recovers. Unfortunately, 30–
50% of these patients will die within 30 days [13].
Extracorporeal liver detoxification devices such as the molec￾ular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS) [14] and fraction￾ated plasma separation, adsorption, and dialysis (FPSA) – the
Prometheus system [15] – have recently been proposed as
novel treatment options for severe liver failure and its compli￾cations (Figure 1). For the MARS device, besides detoxifica￾tion, several studies have ascribed a beneficial effect on portal
and/or systemic haemodynamics [3,16-21]. In contrast, the
impact of the Prometheus device on these variables remains
currently unknown. We therefore aimed to compare, in a con￾trolled manner, potential changes on systemic haemodynam￾ics induced by the MARS or Prometheus system in a group of
patients with alcoholic AoCLF and concomitant hyperdynamic
circulation, and to evaluate associated changes in vasoactive
substances.
Methods
After obtaining approval of the Medical Ethics Committee of
the University Hospital Gasthuisberg, signed informed con￾sent was obtained from all patients or through their next of kin.
Patient selection
Inclusion criteria
The criteria for study entry were histologically (transjugular
liver biopsy) proven alcoholic cirrhosis with superposed alco￾holic hepatitis, portal hypertension with associated hyperdy￾namic circulation (assessed by the hepatic venous pressure
gradient and invasive haemodynamic monitoring), and AoCLF
(defined as a persistent deterioration in liver function despite
treatment of the precipitating event and characterized by an
elevated bilirubin above 12 mg%).
Exclusion criteria
Patients were excluded if they were younger than 18 years or
older than 75 years old, if they had evidence of extrahepatic
cholestasis, of coma of nonhepatic origin or of active gastroin￾testinal bleeding in the past five days before inclusion, if they
had comorbidities associated with poor outcome (necrotic
pancreatitis, neoplasia, severe cardiopulmonary disease
defined by a New York Heart Association score >3, or oxygen￾dependent or steroid-dependent chronic obstructive pulmo￾nary disease), and if there was clinical or microbiological evi￾dence (culture of urine, blood, sputum and ascites) indicative
of ongoing infection. For the purpose of this study, patients
with hepatorenal syndrome type I were excluded since in our

unit these patients are routinely treated with terlipressin and
albumin, which might have interfered with the haemodynamic
measurements.
Study design
The study was designed to include 18 patients, who were ran￾domly assigned (by the method of sealed envelopes) to either
standard medical therapy (SMT) or to SMT with additional
extracorporeal treatment (MARS or Prometheus device).
Treatment was initiated the day after randomization and was
performed during three successive days with a duration of six
hours for each session.
Standard medical therapy
SMT consisted of antibiotic therapy given as primary preven￾tion of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients with tense
ascites. Additionally, in these patients sodium chloride was
restricted to <4 g/day. In case of diuretic-resistant or impaired
respiratory function, therapeutic paracentesis with simultane￾ous intravenous infusion of albumin (8 g/l ascites upon
removal of more than 5 l) was administered. Lactulose was
given in patients with encephalopathy, and if the encephalop￾athy worsened under this regime the protein intake was
reduced to 0.5 g/kg/day.
Vitamin K was given at 10 mg/day intravenously. Substitution
of fresh frozen plasma or appropriate amounts of packed cells
was instated when the prothrombin time dropped below 10%
and haemoglobin decreased below 8 g/dl, respectively. Sub￾stitution of fresh-frozen plasma, packed cells, human serum
albumin or any other plasma expander was recorded. No com￾pensation was foreseen for asymptomatic hyponatraemia
above 120 mEq/l. High caloric nutrition with carbohydrates,
lipids and proteins was calculated at 25 kcal/kg body weight/
day in order to deliver a maximum amino acid intake of 1.2 g/
kg body weight/day. None of the patients were treated with
corticosteroids or experimental drugs during the study period.
Extracorporeal liver assist
Vascular access was obtained for both the MARS and Pro￾metheus devices with a dual-lumen haemodialysis catheter
(Baxter, Brussels, Belgium), preferably placed in a femoral
vein.
Molecular adsorbent recirculating system
The MARS device (kindly provided by Dirinco, Rosmalen, The
Netherlands) consisted of a standard dialysis machine
(AK100; Gambro, Leuven, Belgium) to drive the extracorporal
blood circuit and an extra device to run and monitor a closed￾loop albumin circuit (MARS Monitor; Teraklin AG, Rostock,
Germany) (Figure 1a). The blood flow rate was 150–200 ml/
minute. An albumin-impregnated, highly permeable dialyser
(MARS-flux; Teraklin AG) was used. The closed-loop dialysate
circuit was primed with 600 ml of 20% human serum albumin
(CAF-DCF, Brussels, Belgium) and was driven by a roller
pump of the MARS monitor at 200 ml/minute. The closed-loop
dialysate is regenerated online by dialysis against a bicarbo￾nate-buffered dialysate (processed by the dialysis machine),
followed by passage through a column with uncoated char￾coal and through a second column with an anion exchanger
resin adsorber.
Anticoagulation was carried out with unfractionated heparin as
a priming dose in the arterial line of the extracorporeal circuit
followed by a maintenance infusion, with dosage adjustments
to maintain the activated clotted time between 150 and 200 s.
The Prometheus system
The Prometheus system (Figure 1b) combines FPSA with
high-flux haemodialysis for the removal of both albumin-bound
and water-soluble toxins. The clearance of toxins is achieved
in several steps. Firstly, albumin is separated from blood by a
novel capillary albumin dialyser (AlbuFlow; Fresenius Medical
Care AG, Bad Homburg, Germany). The AlbuFlow is made of
polysulfone hollow fibres and is permeable to albumin (sieving
coefficient, 0.6), and hence to albumin-bound substances. The
blood flow rate was 150–200 ml/minute. The albumin filtrate
in the FPSA circuit is subsequently perfused through a column
with neutral resin (prometh01) and through a second column
with an anion exchanger resin adsorber (prometh02), whereby
the bound toxins are captured by direct contact with the high￾affinity adsorbing material. The 'native' albumin is then returned
to the patient. The FPSA recirculation circuit is driven by a
roller pump at 300 ml/minute. Finally, after passage through
the AlbuFlow, the patient's blood is dialysed through a high￾flux dialyser (FX50; Fresenius Medical Care AG, Bad Hom￾burg, Germany), whereby water-soluble toxins are eliminated.
Maintenance and monitoring of the extracorporeal circuit is
performed by a modified 4008 H haemodialysis unit Fresenius
Medical Care AG, Bad Homburg, Germany).
Anticoagulation was achieved by either unfractionated heparin
(priming dose followed by a maintenance infusion) or regional
citrate.
Monitoring procedures
Biochemical measurements
Serum values with relation to inflammation (leukocytosis and
C-reactive protein), to excretory and desintoxication function
(ammonia, bile acids, bilirubin), to synthesis capacity (albumin,
prothrombin time), to renal function (creatinine, ureum,
sodium) and to endogenous vasopressors (plasma renin activ￾ity, aldosterone, vasopressin and catecholamines) were meas￾ured using standard laboratory procedures. Serum samples
were also assayed for nitrate/nitrite (NOx), a parameter of NO
production, via a fluorometric method using 2,3-diaminon￾aphtalene as previously described with slight modifications
[22].

At the end of the sessions, dialysate samples were taken to
determine potential elimination of neurohumoral pressor sys￾tems and NOx. More specifically, for MARS the dialysate was
sampled with a syringe from the closed loop circuit immedi￾ately after the MARS flux, whereas in the PROMETHEUS sys￾tem the equivalent location was immediately after passage
through the AlbuFlow. If elimination was found, the treatment
phase percentage reduction rate (RRT) was calculated: RRT =
100 × (1 - Cafter/Cbefore), with Cafter and Cbefore being the serum
level before and after treatment, as described elsewhere
[23,24].
All samples were taken in a supine position and at the same
time as the haemodynamic measurements were done, in order
to guarantee reproducible time-points.
Haemodynamic measurements
A radial artery catheter was used for monitoring the MAP, the
heart rate and blood sampling. For measurements of the cen￾tral venous pressure, the cardiac index, the stroke volume and
the systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), either a four￾lumen balloon-tipped, thermodilution, pulmonary artery cathe￾ter (Swan-Ganz; Baxter) was used or a pulse contour continu￾ous cardiac output catheter (PiCCO; Pulsion Medical
Systems AG, Munich, Germany) was used. It is currently
accepted that measurement with this aortic transpulmonary
thermodilution technique gives continuous and intermittent
values that agree with the pulmonary thermodilution method,
but in a less invasive manner [25,26].
Haemodynamic measurements were performed one hour prior
to the MARS/Prometheus treatment and one hour after the
end of the sessions. For the SMT group, haemodynamic meas￾urements were carried out in the same time window as the
SMT with MARS/Prometheus treatment group.
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as the mean ± standard error of the mean,
and as ∆change ± standard error of the mean. The paired t test
was used for pairwise comparison within groups, or the Wil￾coxon test when appropriate. Analysis of variance was used
for comparison between groups. Fisher's Exact test was used
for comparison of frequencies. Data were analysed using Sig￾maSTAT 2.0 (Jandel Corporation, San Rafael, CA, USA). P ≤
0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Patient demographics
Of a total of 35 patients with AoCLF eligible for potential liver
support therapy, 18 patients were finally included in the study.
Seventeen patients were excluded because of diverse rea￾sons: nonalcoholic origin of AoCLF (eight patients), enrolment
in another (multicentre) study (three patients), sepsis (two
patients), hepatorenal syndrome type I (two patients), newly
diagnosed cholangiocarcinoma (one patient) and fatal cardiac
arrest before entry in the study (one patient). General charac￾teristics of the included patients at study entry for each desig￾nated treatment group are presented in Table 1.
Transjugular liver biopsy in all patients, performed in the
screening period, was consistent with the diagnosis of alco￾Table 1

holic cirrhosis with superimposed active alcoholic hepatitis.
Leukocytosis and an elevated C-reactive protein level further
emphasized the inflammatory nature of this condition (Table
2). In five patients variceal bleeding (n = 3) and spontaneous
bacterial peritonitis (n = 2) were found as additional precipitat￾ing factors to alcoholic hepatitis at admission. In order to min￾imize the possibility of spontaneous improvement of liver
function, a time interval, varying from 5 to 11 days, was
respected between control of the precipitating event and
inclusion into the study.
There were no differences between the three groups with
regard to age, biochemical prognostic markers, hepatic
venous pressure gradient, presence of ascites, grade of
encephalopathy and different risk scoring systems for mortal￾ity. All patients were in an advanced state of decompensated
liver disease, with a mean Sequential Organ Failure Assess￾ment score and Model for End-stage Liver Disease score,
respectively, of 8.9 (range, 6–12) and 25.6 (range, 16–35).
These scores are associated with a mean three month pre￾dicted mortality between 76% and 88% [12,27]. The mean
Maddrey score was 63.1, which implies a mortality risk above
50% in the absence of intervention [28].
Biochemical analysis with regard to hepatic 
detoxification, synthetic liver capacity, systemic 
inflammation and renal function
Biochemical variables before and after treatment with MARS
or Prometheus and SMT or with SMT alone are presented in
Table 2. Baseline values of all groups were comparable.
Levels of bilirubin and bile acids, representative of albumin￾bound toxins, were significantly decreased after both MARS
and Prometheus therapy (Table 2). The removal of these sub￾stances was more pronounced with the Prometheus device
(Figure 2).
Re-evaluation of bilirubin levels 3 and 7 days after termination
of the treatment period showed a comparable bilirubin level in
the MARS-treated group at day three post-treatment (19.8 ±
3.8 mg% versus 16.6 ± 1.2 mg% at the end of treatment, P =
0.455), which increased to 25.3 ± 5 mg% at day 7 (P = 0.042
versus end of treatment). A similar evolution was noted in the
Prometheus group – day 3 bilirubin levels amounted to 19.2 ±

3.3 mg% (versus 18 ± 3.2 mg% at the end of treatment, P =
0.590) and rose further to 26.3 ± 2.8 mg% at day 7 (P =
0.046 versus the end of treatment). In the SMT group, bilirubin
remained stable at 29.1 ± 4.5 mg% on day 3 (P = 0.396 ver￾sus end of treatment) and 28 ± 5.4 mg% on day 7 (P =
0.840).
Systemic haemodynamics
The baseline measurements were comparable between all
groups. All patients showed hyperkinetic circulation with a low
MAP (69.7 ± 1.1 mmHg), an elevated cardiac index (4.8 ± 0.3
l/minute/m2) and a low SVRI (1085 ± 76 dyne.s/cm5/m2). In
the control group treated only with SMT, patients showed a
further decrease in MAP (P = 0.05) without changes in the
heart rate, the central venous pressure, the cardiac index and
the SVRI (Table 3). After MARS treatment, we observed an
improvement in the MAP (P = 0.014), stroke volume (P =
0.028) and SVRI (P = 0.036), whereas patients treated with
Prometheus system showed stable haemodynamic parame￾ters, except for an increased heart rate at the end of treatment
(P = 0.001).
Values of the MAP and the SVRI for individual patients are
illustrated in Figure 3a–f. When the effect of treatment on sys￾temic haemodynamics was compared between the different
groups, the beneficial effect of MARS on the MAP (P =
0.002), on the stroke volume (P = 0.003) and on the SVRI (P
= 0.007) was confirmed (Figures 4a–c). There was no signifi￾cant change in the central venous pressure within or between
the groups, suggesting maintenance of the circulating volume
irrespective of extracorporeal liver support. The amount of
packed cells, human serum albumin or any other plasma
expander did not differ between groups. No significant differ￾ence was seen in urine production in the groups and between
all groups over the study period.
Re-evaluation of the MAP three and seven days after termina￾tion of the treatment period showed a comparable MAP at day
three post-treatment (74 ± 3 mmHg versus 76 ± 4 mmHg at
the end of treatment, P = 0.807) which afterwards decreased
to 66 ± 2 mmHg at day seven (P = 0.047 versus end of treat￾ment). No differences in MAP were noted in the Prometheus
and SMT group at day three and seven after the end of the
study period compared with at the end of treatment.
Endogenous vasoactive substances
Changes in levels of endogenous vasoactive substances
within and between the different treatment groups are pre￾sented in Table 4 and Figure 5a–e, respectively. Baseline val￾ues of all groups were comparable. Similar to the direct
haemodynamic assessment, we only observed changes in the
MARS-treated group. All circulating endogenous vasopres￾sors, including the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system
(plasma renin activity, P = 0.044; aldosterone, P = 0.027),
norepinephrine (P = 0.043) and vasopressin (P = 0.005),
decreased significantly after MARS treatment as compared
with the group treated with Prometheus and SMT (Table 4).
Additionally, NOx levels (metabolites of NO) were exclusively
lowered in the MARS group (P = 0.012) (Table 4).
To evaluate potential elimination by the devices, circulating
endogenous vasopressors and NOx levels were also meas￾ured in the albumin dialysate of both the MARS and Prometh￾eus devices. Determination of the concentration of
vasopressin in the dialysate was technically not possible due
to a low detection window. Renin was undetectable in the dia￾lysate of the closed loop of the MARS system. Aldosterone,
norepinephrine and NOx were detected at concentrations of
363 ± 73 ng/l, 0.021 ± 0.05 µg/l and 54.9 ± 11.2 µM, respec￾tively. The calculated RRT values of aldosterone, norepine￾phrine and NOx amounted to 59.5 ± 9%, 38.5 ± 8.3% and

Outcome and safety profile
Overall, the Prometheus and MARS treatment devices were
well tolerated.
In the MARS group, one patient developed trombocytopaenia
with diffuse petechiae and a large haematoma in the left groin
3 days after ending MARS treatment, which after extensive
investigation was attributed to alloimmunization. The patient
recovered fully.
With the Prometheus device, we observed an episode of seri￾ous thrombocytopenia (125 × 10-9/l to 45 × 10-9/l) and hyper￾calcaemia in one patient, a one-time clotting of the secondary
circuit in a second patient, and an episode of hypotension at
the start of the procedure in a third patient.
Discussion
The current concept of the pathogenesis of circulatory dys￾function in cirrhosis is based on the peripheral vasodilation
hypothesis [4,6-8,29]. This hypothesis proposes that splanch￾nic arterial vasodilation is the initiating factor in the systemic
haemodynamic dysfunction. At the early stages of disease,
there is a homeostatic increase in the cardiac output as a
result of the decrease in cardiac afterload and the stimulation
of the sympathetic nervous system. With progression of the
disease and intensified splanchnic vasodilation and subse￾quent systemic vasodilation, the cardiac compensation is no
longer sufficient to balance the decreasing afterload. The arte￾rial pressure decreases, which leads to a baroreceptor-medi￾ated stimulation of sympathetic nervous activity and of the
renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, and to an increased
nonosmotic release of vasopressin in an attempt to preserve
circulatory homeostasis. Activation of these systems leads to
renal salt and water retention, and to ascites. Additionally, the
activation is also responsible for a further aggravation of the
active intrahepatic vascular resistance and the development of
multiorgan failure in cirrhosis [6,8,30].
The exact underlying pathophysiological mechanism to the
hyperdynamic state remains unknown but probably represents
a multifactorial phenomenon and may involve impaired neuro￾genic responses, accumulation of vasodilators and diminished
responsiveness to a variety of vasoconstrictors [31]. Ample
evidence suggests a central role for excessive production of
NO in both the splanchnic and systemic vascular territories
[31-36].
In the present study we observed an improvement of the
hyperdynamic state during MARS therapy. It is unlikely that
this haemodynamic improvement in the MARS group was

induced by changes in fluid balance. Indeed, there were no dif￾ferences between the treatment groups with regard to central
filling, serum albumin and creatinine levels. In both dialysis
groups, pump speeds and fluid exchange rates were similar.
Furthermore, the favourable effect on the MAP in patients
treated with MARS disappeared within four days after cessa￾tion of treatment, which further emphasizes a causal relation￾ship to MARS. The improvement in the SVRI and MAP
therefore strongly suggests temporary changes and/or elimi￾nation in endogenous vasoactive substances.
We observed a reduction in NOx levels that correlated nega￾tively with the improvement in the SVRI. Additionally, this was
associated with a drop in endogenous vasopressor systems,
which are considered to act as counteracting factors for
excessive splanchnic and systemic vasodilation, most proba￾bly induced by NO. The question of whether NO is directly
removed from the circulation by the MARS device is difficult to
explore as the metabolic fate of NO is still poorly understood.
NO is a labile species with a half-life of only a few seconds
[31]. NO therefore acts locally and is degraded or converted
rapidly into intermediate metabolites. Putative intermediate
metabolites include an array of low molecular weight and high
molecular weight thiols, nitrosoglutathione, nitrosohaemo￾globin and nitrosoalbumin, some of which might be present in
sufficient quantities to exert biological effects [37-41].
Whether S-nitroso adducts of serum albumin act as a 'haemo￾dynamically active' circulating depot of NO in vivo, as sug￾gested by Stamler and colleagues [38] and Rafikova and
colleagues [39], and result in the removal of NO in this way by
MARS, remains subject to practical and theoretical criticism
[38-41]. Furthermore, the value of measuring NOx as a param￾eter of NO synthase activity can also be discussed, but at
present it remains by far the most 'simple' and direct index of
NO generation [37].
A second explanation of how MARS might affect the systemic
characteristics of portal hypertension is that it might directly
target the active, modifiable component of the increased intra￾hepatic vascular resistance by a decrease in the intrahepatic
action of vasoconstrictors [16,42]. In the present study we
found a reduction in vasopressor hormones during MARS
treatment, suggesting either decreased production or elimina￾tion, or a combination of both. Combined elimination and
decreased production seems most probable. We could dem￾onstrate the presence of pressor hormones, such as norepine￾phrine and aldosterone, in the closed loop albumin dialysate,
whereas renin was undetectable in dialysate samples despite
decreased serum levels after MARS treatment. Because of its
molecular size, renin is not removable by MARS, indicating
that MARS exerts control on the degree of counteractivation
of endogenous vasoconstrictor systems. This latter observa￾tion suggests that the reduction in vasopressors is a conse￾quence of the improved haemodynamic situation, therefore
favouring the hypothesis of primarily eliminating a systemic
vasodilating substance, such as NO.
A third possibility involves removal of inflammatory mediators
due to the inflammation-related precipitant of the AoCLF in all
of these patients, more specifically alcoholic steatohepatitis.
Tumour necrosis factor alpha, a highly expressed proinflamma￾tory cytokine, particularly in alcoholic steatohepatitis, is cur￾rently considered the most important vasoactive inflammatory
mediator in this context [43]. More specifically, it has been
shown that antagonism of tumour necrosis factor alpha with
anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha antibody attenuates portal
hypertension and the associated hyperdynamic state, both
experimentally [44] and in humans [45].
Sen and colleagues [46] studied the effect of MARS on
tumour necrosis factor alpha in patients with alcoholic AoCLF
and found no changes in plasma levels after seven days of
MARS treatment, despite a documented removal of tumour
necrosis factor alpha and its receptor TNF-R1, suggesting that
the concurrent cytokine production due to the disease proc￾ess itself balanced any removal. In the current study, inflamma￾Table 4

tory markers, such as leukocytosis and C-reactive protein,
remained unchanged in all groups, which supports the find￾ings of Sen and colleagues [16,46]. Together these data re￾emphasize the hypothesis that MARS removes a putative cir￾culating vasoactive circulating factor from the peripheral blood
independent of changes in vasoactive cytokines.
Our results further suggest that MARS is effective in temporar￾ily improving haemodynamics, while the Prometheus system

does not. In contrast, the Prometheus device showed a higher
ability of clearing albumin-bound toxins [24,47] than MARS. A
possible explanation for this finding relates to conceptual dif￾ferences (Figure 1). The Prometheus device is based on
FPSA, which involves selective filtration of the native albumin
('fractionated plasma separation') through a specific albumin￾permeable polysulfon filter (with a cutoff value of 250 kDa) into
a secondary circuit. In this secondary circuit, the albumin frac￾tion is then directly purified by adsorption on a neutral resin
adsorber and an anion exchanger, and thereafter returned to
the plasma. In addition to the FPSA step, high-flux haemodial￾ysis is performed. The filtration step presumably is the predom￾inant factor in the lack of haemodynamic effects [48].
Besides a decreased potential to eliminate the investigated
endogenous vasoactive substances, as documented by the
lower calculated reduction ratios for these hormones com￾pared with those of MARS, the FPSA step of the Prometheus
system might also have been responsible for minimal changes
in colloid osmotic pressure during the procedure. These mini￾mal changes could have caused subclinical volume shifts that
prohibited the deactivation of the homeostatic baroreceptor
response [15]. Indeed, in our study the concurrent production
of endogenous vasoactive substances itself balanced any
removal since no differences in the levels of these agents were
observed at the end of treatment compared with the beginning
of treatment. The increased heart rate, as a compensatory
mechanism, might also be an indirect index of subclinical vol￾ume shifts.
Several factors make patients with AoCLF extremely sensitive
to volume changes, such as the decreased effective circulat￾ing volume with persistent counteracting vasopressor
response, the increased cardiac output with impaired end￾diastolic filling and the autonomic vascular dysfunction [49].
Conclusion
The present study demonstrates that MARS improves haemo￾dynamic disturbances in patients with acute on chronic alco￾holic liver failure with associated hyperdynamic circulation.
These beneficial haemodynamic effects can be explained by
the removal of circulating endogenous vasoactive substances
and are in agreement with the current hypothesis of the patho￾genesis of portal hypertension.

Key messages
• Central in the pathogenesis of AoCLF, defective detoxi￾fication leads to life-threatening complications, includ￾ing an aggravated hyperdynamic circulation.
• The liver assist devices, MARS and Prometheus, are 
extracorporeal, nonbiological liver support devices able 
to remove albumin-bound toxins, typically present in 
AoCLF.
• Compared with SMT alone, the MARS and Prometheus 
devices significantly decrease albumin-bound toxins 
(bile acids, bilirubin) in patients with alcoholic AoCLF.
• Additionally, the MARS device, but not the Prometheus 
device, also attenuates the hyperdynamic circulation by 
increasing both the MAP and SVRI, probably by the 
demonstrated decrease in endogenous circulating 
vasoactive substances. This further supports the crucial 
role of vascular mediators in the pathophysiology of por￾tal hypertension in humans.
• The haemodynamic difference in this study emphasizes 
conspicuous conceptual differences among the albu￾min dialysis devices.
