Abstract
Introduction: Patients with severe acute pancreatitis are at risk of candidal infections carrying the potential risk of
an increase in mortality. Since early diagnosis is problematic, several clinical risk scores have been developed to
identify patients at risk. Such patients may benefit from prophylactic antifungal therapy while those patients who
have a low risk of infection may not benefit and may be harmed. The aim of this study was to assess the validity
and discrimination of existing risk scores for invasive candidal infections in patients with severe acute pancreatitis.
Methods: Patients admitted with severe acute pancreatitis to the intensive care unit were analysed. Outcomes and
risk factors of admissions with and without candidal infection were compared. Accuracy and discrimination of
three existing risk scores for the development of invasive candidal infection (Candida score, Candida Colonisation
Index Score and the Invasive Candidiasis Score) were assessed.
Results: A total of 101 patients were identified from 2003 to 2011 and 18 (17.8%) of these developed candidal
infection. Thirty patients died, giving an overall hospital mortality of 29.7%. Hospital mortality was significantly
higher in patients with candidal infection (55.6% compared to 24.1%, P = 0.02). Candida colonisation was
associated with subsequent candidal infection on multivariate analysis. The Candida Colonisation Index Score was
the most accurate test, with specificity of 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68 to 0.88), sensitivity of 0.67 (95% CI
0.41 to 0.87), negative predictive value of 0.91 (95% CI 0.82 to 0.97) and a positive likelihood ratio of 3.2 (95% CI 1.9
to 5.5). The Candida Colonisation Index Score showed the best discrimination with area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve of 0.79 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.87).
Conclusions: In this study the Candida Colonisation Index Score was the most accurate and discriminative test at
identifying which patients with severe acute pancreatitis are at risk of developing candidal infection. However its
low sensitivity may limit its clinical usefulness.
Introduction
Infections caused by fungal pathogens have increased in
the last two decades with data from the USA between
1979 and 2000 demonstrating a 207% increase [1]. In
the Extended Prevalence of Infection in Intensive Care
(EPIC II) study, candida was the fourth most common
cause of infection in ICUs worldwide [2]. Infections in
Europe are less frequent; however, in the Sepsis Occur￾rence in Acutely Ill Patients (SOAP) study, candidal
organisms still accounted for 17% of infections [3].
Other data demonstrate that candidaemia in intensive
care patients, however, has remained static or even
decreased in recent years [4]. Most cases are caused by
Candida albicans, but there are numerous other species,
and antifungal resistance spectrums of these vary.
Numerous risk factors have been identified for the
development of Candida spp bloodstream infection.
These include the presence of invasive lines, for example
central venous catheters (CVCs), antibiotic therapy,
acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy
(RRT), malignancy and neutropenia, previous abdominal
surgery, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), long term hos￾pitalisation and prior fungal colonisation [5-8].
Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) has also been identi￾fied as a risk factor for candidal infection [9]. Candidal
infection has been identified as a cause of increased

mortality in patients post-operatively and in the criti￾cally ill [8,10,11] but its effect on the outcome of SAP
has been disputed [12-15]. A healthy pancreas is rela￾tively resistant to fungal infection; however, pancreatic
necrosis carries a disproportionately higher risk of infec￾tion with bacterial and fungal organisms. Prior use of
antibiotics has been demonstrated to increase the risk of
fungal infection [5]. Prophylactic or empirical antifungal
treatment has been advocated for high-risk surgical
patients [16-19] and demonstrated to prevent fungal
infection in SAP patients [12]. ‘Prophylactic’ antifungal
treatment is defined as administration of antifungals to
patients identified as having a particular diagnosis or
particular factors that confer a high risk of subsequent
fungal infection. ‘Empirical’ treatment is defined as anti￾fungal therapy given to patients with clinical features of
an inflammatory response consistent with infection but
without microbiological confirmation. As delays in treat￾ment are associated with increased mortality and fungal
culture can take up to 72 hours, it would be desirable to
identify patients at risk for invasive infection whilst
minimising unnecessary treatment and reducing the risk
of resistance through increases in non-albicans species
[7,20].
As a consequence, several risk scoring systems have
been developed in an attempt to aid discrimination
between candida colonisation and invasive candidal
infection (ICI) [6,8,9]. These combine the identification
of high-risk patients with clinical and microbiological
data to identify those patients at risk of developing ICI.
The aim of this study was to identify the prevalence of
ICI in a population of critically ill patients with SAP, to
identify risk factors for the development of ICI and to
evaluate its impact on patient outcome. In addition we
assessed the accuracy and discrimination of three pre￾viously described risk scores for ICI in this cohort of
patients [6,8,9].
Materials and methods
A single centre, retrospective study was conducted at a
tertiary referral centre for patients with SAP. After dis￾cussion with the local Research Ethics Committee, the
study protocol was approved and the requirement for
written informed consent was waived, since informed
consent for collection and analysis of patient data
recorded in the Case Mix Programme database is not
required under Section 251 of the NHS Act 2006
(approval number PAIG 2-10(f)/2005). All patients
admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of SAP between
July 2003 and February 2011 were screened for inclusion
in the study. Suitable cases were identified from the
admissions database. Patients who were re-admitted to
the ICU during the same hospital stay or who were
transferred from other ICUs were excluded from further
analysis. SAP was defined as acute pancreatitis with true
organ dysfunction irrespective of local complications as
per consensus guidelines in 2004 [21]. ‘Significant
necrosis’ was defined as the presence of more than 30%
necrosis seen on abdominal computed tomography
scans, as reported by a radiologist. Three independent
workers extracted data from the case notes and electro￾nic records of each admission onto an Excel spread￾sheet. The aetiology of SAP was classified into ‘alcohol’,
‘gallstones’, ‘drug’, or ‘idiopathic’. ‘Unknown’ was
recorded if no cause could be identified from the case
notes. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation
(APACHE II) scores were extracted from the ICU
admission database. For admissions without APACHE II
scores due to a unit length of stay less than eight hours,
admission physiology data were entered into a web￾based calculator [22] in order to calculate an admission
APACHE II score.
All patients were treated according to a routine stan￾dard of care. This included adherence to care bundles, no
prophylactic antibiotics, daily measurement of C-reactive
protein and early enteral feeding. Naso-gastric feeding
was used for nutritional support, guided by the patient’s
ideal body weight. Prokinetics were started when absorp￾tion was poor and, if necessary, a post-pyloric feeding
tube was inserted. TPN was considered if post-pyloric
feeding was unsuccessful. Abdominal computed tomo￾graphy scans were performed on admission and then
every seven to ten days, and minimally invasive pancrea￾tic necrosectomy (MIRPN), open necrosectomy or radi￾ologically-guided drainage was performed, as surgically
indicated.
Samples for candidal colonisation were taken routinely
from tracheal aspirates and/or bronchial lavage, skin
swabs and drainage fluid (if drains were in situ). Further
sampling (for example, culture of blood, line tips and
pancreatic tissue samples) was performed if indicated by
clinical need. Patients were classified as having ICI if
they had: 1) ≥ 1 positive blood culture or 2) ≥ 1 positive
pancreatic tissue culture or 3) ≥ 1 pancreatic drain fluid
culture positive for Candida spp. and in addition
received antifungal drugs after the positive drain fluid
culture. Antifungal therapy is only initiated after discus￾sion between an intensive care consultant and a medical
microbiologist with an interest in intensive care. Patients
with Candida cultured from one or more samples from
respiratory secretions, urine, line tips, or wound or skin
swabs alone were classified as colonised.
For determination of risk in the scoring systems, the
following were considered risk factors: 1) severe sepsis
as defined by the 2001 SCCM/ESICM/ACCP/ATS/SIS
International Sepsis Definitions Conference criteria [23];
2) central venous access: presence of a CVC or periph￾erally inserted central venous catheter (PICC) on days

one to three post ICU admission; 3) systemic antibiotics:
any intravenous antibiotics on days one to three post
ICU admission (excluding prophylactic antibiotics given
after surgery or to treat reduced gastric motility); 4)
renal replacement therapy (RRT): any form of RRT
given on day one to three post ICU admission; 5) ster￾oids: any dose of corticosteroids given during the seven
days prior and three days after admission to ICU; 6)
immunosuppressive drugs: any immunosuppressive
drugs (as listed in the British National Formulary ver￾sion 59 section 8.2) given during the seven days prior to
admission; 7) surgery: any intra-abdominal surgical pro￾cedure during the seven days prior to admission; and 8)
TPN: any TPN delivered via a CVC or PICC on days
one to three post ICU admission.
Statistics
Descriptive statistics were performed on the entire
cohort of admissions and on admissions with and with￾out ICI. Univariate analysis was performed to assess dif￾ferences in the characteristics of patients with and
without ICI. ICU and ultimate hospital mortality were
compared between the two groups.
Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed
using ICI as the dependent variable with candida coloni￾sation, presence of necrosis and length of ICU stay as
independent variables.
‘Candida score’ was calculated for each admission as
described previously [6] with appropriate weightings for
each variable. Weightings are as follows: TPN, surgery,
multifocal colonisation: 1 point; severe sepsis: 2 points.
Patients with a score >3 were defined as ‘positive’. Since
the Invasive Candidiasis score includes SAP as a risk
factor, SAP was removed for this study and a modified
‘Invasive Candidiasis’ risk score [9] was calculated for
each admission as follows: Patients who had developed
ICI and met the criteria of having received antibiotics
and had a CVC and at least one of: TPN, RRT, surgery,
steroids or immunosuppressants were defined as true
positives. Immunosuppression was defined as described
above. A Candida Colonization Index Score (CCIS) was
calculated for each patient using the methods described
[8] as follows: CCIS = ratio of the number of non-blood
distinct body sites colonised with Candida spp to the
total number of body sites cultured. A CCIS ≥ 0.5 pre￾dicts Candida infection; therefore, patients who had ICI
and a CCIS ≥ 0.5 were defined as true positives.
The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value
(PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), positive likeli￾hood ratio (LR+) and negative likelihood ratio (LR-) were
calculated for each score, along with 95% confidence
intervals. For PPV and NPV, prevalence levels as
described in the study population were used. Area under
the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC)
with exact binomial confidence intervals was calculated
for each score using the method of DeLong [24]. Com￾parisons between groups of categorical data were made
using Fisher’s exact test or c2 test where appropriate.
Continuous data were compared using the student’s t
test for normally distributed data, or the Mann-Whitney
U test for non-normally distributed data. Results were
considered statistically significant when P values were
<0.05. MedCalc v.12.0 (MedCalc Software, Belgium) was
used for statistical analysis.
Results
There were 213 ICU admissions with SAP during the
study period. There were 32 re-admissions of 26 patients
during the same hospital stay. Seventy-six patients were
excluded as they were directly transferred to the ICU
from other hospitals. Four patients already had estab￾lished candidal infection on admission to ICU and were
excluded from further analysis (Figure 1). Therefore, 101
patients were included of whom 58 (57%) were men. The
median (IQR) age was 60 (50 to 73) years, and the most
common causes of SAP were gallstones (45 (44.6%)) and
alcohol (30 (29.7%) (Table 1)
There was no significant difference in APACHE II
scores between the two groups. Eighteen (17.8%) patients
developed ICI. Patients with ICI had a longer median
length of ICU stay (16.9 versus 7.3 days, P = 0.0043).
There was a significant association between open necro￾sectomy and subsequent ICI (Table 1, P = 0.0171) on
univariate analysis, but this was not significant in regres￾sion analysis. Overall, 18 (17.8%) patients died in ICU
with a higher mortality in patients with ICI (5/18 (27.8%)
versus 13/83 (15.7%)). Overall hospital mortality was
29.7% (30/101) which was significantly higher in patients
who developed ICI: 10/18 patients (55.6%) died, com￾pared to 20 deaths in 83 patients without ICI (24.1%)
(P = 0.0201) (Table 1).
Table 2 displays the risk factors for development of
ICI for those patients with and without ICI. There were
no significant differences in incidence of severe sepsis,
or use of CVC lines, antibiotics, RRT, steroids, immuno￾suppressive therapy, previous surgery or TPN between
the two groups. Of the known risk factors, only coloni￾sation with Candida spp. was significantly greater in the
ICI group. Sixteen (88.9%) patients with invasive candida
infection were colonised with candida, as opposed to 37
(44.6%) without subsequent infection (P = 0.0006)
(Table 2). Using logistic regression analysis, colonisation
with candida (OR 4.33) was the only factor significantly
associated with invasive candidal infection (Table 3).
Candida infections
Eighteen patients developed ICI, giving an infection rate
of 13.2 per 1,000 days (18/1,359 days). Candidaemia was

present in 5 (27.8%) infected patients (3.7 per 1,000
days). Five patients had only candidaemia, whereas three
patients with candidaemia also had either tissue or
abdominal fluid samples that were positive for candida
spp. Candida spp. were isolated in pancreatic tissue in
four patients. Ten patients had Candida in abdominal
drain fluid samples only and received antifungal
medication.
Candida species isolated
In the patients with a positive blood or tissue culture,
C. albicans was isolated in seven patients, C. glabrata
and C. lusitaniae each in one patient and C. albicans
and C. glabrata in one patient. In patients who had a
positive drain fluid culture and subsequent antifungal
therapy, there were three patients with C. albicans, two
with C. glabrata and one each with C. parapsilosis and
C. lusitaniae. One sample contained a mixed growth of
C. albicans and C. parapsilosis (Figure 2a and 2b).
Candida risk scores
Data regarding colonisation screening were not available
for six patients and so these were excluded from analy￾sis of the performance of the CCIS. The risk prediction
scores tested demonstrated low sensitivities, with values
below 0.7 (Table 4). The Candida Score had the highest
specificity of 0.85 and the CCIS had a specificity of 0.79.
All scoring systems had high NPVs (>0.7). PPVs were
all below 0.5. The CCIS demonstrated a LR + of 3.2 and
the other scores tested had lower LR + values. No
scores had LR - below 0.1.
The CCIS had the best discrimination of the scores
tested, with AUROC of 0.79 (Figure 3). The other two
scores demonstrated poor discrimination, with AUROCs
less than 0.7.
Discussion
An increase in Candida infection in non-neutropenic criti￾cally ill patients has been demonstrated to put them at
increased risk of mortality and morbidity [4,6]. Whilst
there is a concern that this is the case in patients with
SAP [10,11,25-28], this has not been universally demon￾strated [12-15]. It is, however, likely that colonisation plays
an important instigating role in these invasive infections.
Patients with SAP are at particular risk of ICI. In this
study both colonisation with Candida spp. and a CCIS
>0.5 were associated with subsequent infection [8]. It can
be difficult to distinguish colonisation from ICI. There is
evidence that delaying antifungals in ICI is associated with
increased mortality [29]; however, current antimicrobial
culture techniques can still take up to 72 hours to grow
yeasts [30]. Therefore, the unanswered question is whether
critically ill patients with SAP should receive routine pro￾phylactic antifungals with the risk of selecting out resistant
strains of candida or whether treatment should be delayed
until a positive culture is obtained.

Aetiology and infection
The aetiology of SAP in this study was predominantly
gallstones (44%) or alcohol (30%). In this study, as in
previous studies, there was no difference in the inci￾dence of ICI in patients with either aetiology [31].
Our data indicate that a clinically significant proportion
of patients (17.8%) with SAP develop ICI during their

ICU admission, giving an infection rate of 13.2 per 1,000
days for ICI and 3.7 per 1,000 days for candidaemia.
However, as our data includes infections other than can￾didaemias, the infection rate is higher than others have
demonstrated [7,32,33]. ICI was associated with both a
longer ICU length of stay and higher hospital mortality.
APACHE II scoring did not distinguish between the two
groups (median APACHE II scores were 17 and 16 for
patients with and without ICI, respectively). Other
groups have identified an association in critically ill
patients between severity of illness and prevalence of ICI
[8,11]. It might be expected that the prevalence of candi￾dal infection should be higher in those with a greater
severity of illness. Pittet et al. found that an APACHE II
score of 20 or above was associated with increased noso￾comial infections [8]. Our patients had a lower median
APACHE II score than described in other studies that
included critically ill patients with fungal infections,
which may partly explain why we did not find the same
association with candidal infection.
Risk factors for invasive candidal infection
Previously identified risk factors for the development of
fungal infection in critically ill patients include the pre￾sence of CVCs, the use of antibiotics and steroids, recent
abdominal surgery and TPN [5-7,34]. In this study only
colonisation with candida was identified as being signifi￾cantly associated with subsequent candidal infection.
Although we did not find an association between abdom￾inal surgery prior to admission and candidal infection,
there was a significant association between open necro￾sectomy and subsequent ICI on univariate analysis (Table
1). However, since open necrosectomies are performed
less frequently and are reserved for more complex and dif￾ficult cases, this finding should be interpreted with caution
since it may well represent a confounding factor. Indeed,
on logistic regression analysis, open necrosectomy was not
associated with candidal infection (Table 3). Antibiotics,
steroids, CVC, TPN, RRT, immunosuppression and pre￾vious abdominal surgery were not associated with ICI in
this study. In previous studies, the use of broad-spectrum
antibiotics has been consistently associated with candidal
infection [8,27,28,34,35]. One explanation for this discre￾pancy may be that we only looked at a period of three
days after ICU admission when antibiotics were used and
not the period before ICU admission.
Our data differ from those of other groups who have
consistently demonstrated surgery, TPN and severe sep￾sis to be predictors of candidal infection in an unse￾lected group of critically ill patients [6,34]; however, the
number of patients who developed ICI in this study was
small. More than 90% of our cohort of patients had cen￾tral venous access and, therefore, it is perhaps not sur￾prising that this did not discriminate between patients
with and without ICI.
Colonisation
Leon et al. demonstrated that multifocal colonisation
(two or more non-contiguous sites) was a predictor of
ICI [6]. The results of this study support the finding

that colonisation is a risk factor for later infection with
an odds ratio of 4.49 (Table 3). Simple numerical num￾ber of colonisation sites has been disputed as a techni￾que sophisticated enough to predict invasive infection;
and Pittet et al. developed a ‘corrected colonisation
index’ that expressed the intensity of colonisation rather
than just the number of sites [8]. A threshold index of
0.5 (positive/sites tested) was able to identify patients
who went on to develop invasive bloodstream or other
sterile site infection [8]. Our data demonstrated a signif￾icant association between candida colonisation and
development of ICI, when compared to patients without
ICI (88.9% versus 44.6% P = 0.006).
The CCIS had a NPV of 0.91 (Table 4) and specificity of
0.79, that is, patients with a CCIS <0.5 are unlikely to have
invasive infection, although the negative LR was 0.4, above
the value of 0.1 that has been suggested as being useful at
the bedside [36]. The CCIS may be the most useful test to
identify those patients who are unlikely to benefit from
antifungal therapy. In these patients, the risks of adminis￾tering prophylactic antifungals may outweigh the benefits.
Using this rule in this cohort of patients, 28 (27.7%) would
have received prophylactic antifungals, 16 of whom were
‘false positives’, and six patients would not have received
prophylactic antifungals when they actually had an inva￾sive candidal infection.
Performance and discrimination of risk scores for
invasive candidal infection
The AUROC is a measure of discriminative power with
values above 0.8 suggesting excellent discrimination [37].
The CCIS was the most discriminating test between
patients with invasive infection and those without, as
assessed by the AUROC, with an AUROC of 0.79 (95% CI
0.69-0.87) (Figure 3). The other two scores did not show
good discrimination in this cohort of patients (Table 4).
Although the PPV (0.43) and LR+ (3.2) were greatest
for the CCIS among the three scores tested, they are not
high enough to be clinically useful [36]. In agreement
with other studies [37], the existing scoring systems are
good at identifying those at lower risk of developing inva￾sive candidal disease, since all scores showed reasonable
specificities and NPV (Table 4).
Limitations
This study is limited in its retrospective nature with the
risk of missing data. True ICI is also difficult to identify.
Our definition of ICI in those patients who had candida in
abdominal fluid and received antifungal treatment could
be disputed, as it may not be a completely accurate indica￾tor of invasive disease. However, given the retrospective
nature of this study, it is an appropriate assumption that
patients who received antifungal therapy after a positive
fluid culture represented true infection.
Another weakness in this study is that routine surveil￾lance swabs of patients with SAP are not taken, so it
could be argued that the association between colonisa￾tion and infection is not causative, since patients with￾out signs of infection are less likely to have been
screened. However, there was no significant difference
in the proportion of patients with ICI who were
screened (100%) and those without ICI who were
screened (92.8%, P = 0.587). Patients known to be colo￾nised with candida who then cultured candida in
abdominal fluid may have been more likely to receive
antifungal treatment, representing a confounding factor,
despite the input from a medical microbiologist. The
data may also be skewed by our hospital being a tertiary
referral centre and receiving patients at varying stages of
their disease. Finally, the study was conducted at a sin￾gle-centre, and so our results may not be applicable to
other health-care settings.
Conclusions
Patients with SAP are known to be at high risk for ICI. We
have demonstrated that ICI in SAP patients is associated
with increased hospital mortality and longer duration of
ICU stay. We have also shown that one of the existing risk
scoring systems (CCIS [8]) in a population of critically ill
patients with SAP has good discrimination to identify
patients who are at low risk of developing ICI. Patients
who have a CCIS of <0.5 are unlikely to go on to develop
invasive candida infections. Further studies investigating
the benefit of prophylactic antifungal treatment in patients
with SAP and a CCIS of ≥ 0.5 are needed.
Key messages
• Patients with pancreatitis and invasive fungal infec￾tion have significantly greater hospital mortality.
• Existing scoring systems are good at discriminating
patients at low risk of developing invasive candidal
infection.
• Colonisation significantly increases the risk of inva￾sive infection.
• Patients with a CCIS of <0.5 are unlikely to
develop invasive infection.
