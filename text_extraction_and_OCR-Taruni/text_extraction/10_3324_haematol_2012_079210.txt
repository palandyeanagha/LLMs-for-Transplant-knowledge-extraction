Amyloidosis
Introduction
Systemic immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis (AL) is a
fatal form of plasma cell dyscrasia characterized by the fibril￾lar deposits of monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains.
1 The
deposition process results in progressive organ dysfunction
leading to the death of the patient. Fortunately, over the past
decade several therapies have been found to be effective
against AL. These include high-dose melphalan followed by
autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), melphalan-dex￾amethasone and regimens containing novel agents.
2
Successful therapy in AL is characterized by hematologic
response followed by organ response.
3,4 Organ response is
essential since the majority of these patients do not have mul￾tiple myeloma and do not die from bone marrow failure.
5
Instead, they die of organ failure, most commonly heart fail￾ure. The importance of this is highlighted by the ability of
cardiac biomarkers [high sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs￾cTnT) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro￾BNP)] to predict outcomes and tolerability of aggressive treat￾ment such as ASCT.
6 Improvement in cardiac biomarkers has
also been associated with better overall survival.
4
The kidney is the most common organ involved in AL and
may be the only organ involved in some patients. Proteinuria
is present in up to 73% of patients and approximately 50%
will have renal insufficiency.
5 Since measurements of creati￾nine and proteinuria are well standardized, the determination
of renal response is quite easy and reliable. Indeed, renal
response has been shown to correlate with overall survival.
3
Currently, renal response is defined as a 50% decrease in pro￾teinuria in the absence of a 25% increase in serum creatinine
(Scr) with a minimum of 0.5 mg/dL or a 25% decrease in
glomerular filtration rate or creatinine clearance.
7
Unfortunately, these criteria do not differentiate patients with
complete reversal of proteinuria from those who just had a
50% reduction. Furthermore, the importance of maintaining
stable renal function in order to achieve a renal response has
been called into question. This study was undertaken to
study the individual renal response criteria in greater detail.
Design and Methods
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the
Mayo Foundation, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki
Principles and the guidelines of the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPPA). Potential patients were identified by
querying the Mayo Clinic AL Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation
database for subjects transplanted between 1995 and December of
2010. The details of ASCT have been previously described.
8 To be
included in this study, patients had to have a baseline proteinuria >1
g/dL and at least 1 year of follow-up after ASCT. Patients with missing
relevant laboratory data (n=3), or who were dialysis dependent prior

Organ response correlates with overall survival in patients with immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis and is the
goal of treatment. This study evaluates the current renal response criteria and their ability to predict overall survival.
Patients with immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis who underwent autologous stem cell transplantation
between 1995 and 2010 were recruited. Eligibility criteria included >1 g/dL of proteinuria, dialysis independence at
baseline and within the first year of autologous stem cell transplantation, and a minimum follow-up of 1 year.
Responses were assessed by the best values after autologous stem cell transplantation. The difference between
involved and uninvolved serum free light chain levels was used to determine hematologic response. Increases in
serum creatinine were calculated from the highest creatinine after autologous stem cell transplantation. Inclusion
and exclusion criteria were met by 141 patients. These patients had a median follow-up of 52 months. Superior
overall survival was observed in patients with a >75% reduction in proteinuria and those who had a >95% reduc￾tion had additional benefits. The overall survival of patients with >50% to ≤75% proteinuria was similar to that of
patients with ≤50% reduction. A rise in serum creatinine >25% was not associated with a poorer outcome in
patients with a >75% reduction in proteinuria. Deeper hematologic responses were associated with higher rates of
proteinuria reduction. These results suggest that further evaluation of the current renal response criteria is needed.
In particular, discrimination of the renal response into complete and partial categories and modification of the serum
creatinine requirement seem justified.

ABSTRACT

to ASCT (n=12) were excluded. Patients who developed end-stage
renal disease requiring dialysis or within a year of ASCT or who
had a kidney transplant (n=44) were excluded from the study.
Patients who died (n=78) within 1 year of ASCT were also exclud￾ed. Anyone who developed a second malignancy (n=4) other than
multiple myeloma was also excluded. Finally, since survival was
measured from the day of stem cell infusion, patients who had
received >4 months of chemotherapy prior to ASCT were also
excluded (n=8).
Baseline data were collected from the closest time prior to
ASCT. Overall survival was calculated from the day of stem cell
infusion. Proteinuria was calculated from 24-hour urine collec￾tions. The best proteinuria reduction was calculated from the low￾est proteinuria measured after ASCT. Time to 50% reduction in
proteinuria was measured in 3-month intervals between 12 and 24
months after transplantation. The change in Scr after ASCT was
calculated from the highest (of at least two consecutive readings)
stable Scr after ASCT. Hematologic response was determined
using the new criteria.
9 Reduction of free light chain was assessed
by both involved serum free light chain (sFLC) and the difference
between involved and uninvolved free light chains (dFLC).
According to the new hematologic response criteria, complete
response was defined as having a normal sFLC ratio with no
detectable monoclonal protein in the serum or urine. A very good
partial response was defined as a dFLC of <40 mg/L. Reduction of
dFLC by >50% was considered a partial response and a reduction
<50% was considered no response. In this study, the best hema￾tologic response was used for comparison. Receiver operator
characteristic (ROC) curves were employed to determine cutoffs
for various parameters. Overall survival was calculated using the
Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analysis was performed using
a proportional hazard model. P values <0.05 were deemed statis￾tically significant.
Results
During the study period, 156 patients met the inclusion
criteria. Three patients were excluded for not having both
pre- and post-transplant sFLC measurements. Four
patients developed another malignancy (1 acute myeloge￾nous leukemia, 2 non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and 1 adeno￾carcinoma of the gut) and eight were excluded for having
had >4 months of therapy prior to ASCT. The median fol￾low up for the remaining 141 patients was 51.8 months.
The median age was 58 (range 25 -72) years and 57.7%
were male. Other baseline characteristics are listed in
Table 1. Cardiac biomarkers were considered normal
according to cardiac staging in 54.7% of patients in this
study.
10 All patients in cardiac stage 2 in this study were
classified in this stage as the result of abnormal
NTproBNP.
Proteinuria was reduced by >50%, >75% and >95% in
73.1%, 58.2% and 34.0% of patients, respectively. The
median time to 50% proteinuria reduction was 11.1
months and all renal responders had >50% reduction in
proteinuria by 24 months. Scr increased >25% in 38.2%,
and >25% with a minimum of 0.5 mg/dL in 24.1% of this
cohort. According to the current definition, 61.0% met the
criteria for renal response. The distribution of hematologic
response was 53.9% with complete response, 34.7% with
very good partial resposne, 8.5% with partial response
and 2.8% with no response. A >50% reduction in sFLC
was noted in 90.8% and a >90% reduction in 38.3% of
patients. Serum albumin improved by 12 g/L after ASCT.
Using the proportional hazard model, the best serum albu￾min achieved after ASCT was associated with improved
overall survival (P=0.03) but the change in serum albumin
was not (P=0.16). It was not an independent predictor of
overall survival in the multivariate analysis.
Overall survival was significantly better in patients who
achieved a renal response (P<0.001). To explore the effect
of the depth of the renal response on overall survival,
patients were further divided into smaller groups. In the
subgroup analysis, overall survival was found to improve
with increasing reduction in proteinuria (Figure 1A). Best
overall survival was noted in patients with >95% reduc￾tion in proteinuria. Even within the group of patients with
>75% proteinuria reduction, there was a statistically sig￾nificant improvement in overall survival in those with
>95% proteinuria reduction versus those with >75% to
≤95% reduction (not reached versus not reached, P=0.006).
On the other hand, just having a >50% reduction in pro￾teinuria had little impact on overall survival. There was no
difference in overall survival between patients with >50%
to ≤75% reduction in proteinuria (n=21) versus those
(n=34) with ≤50% proteinuria reduction (72.8 months ver￾sus not reached, respectively, P=0.34, Figure 1B). Among
the patients with a >50% reduction in proteinuria, overall
survival was improved only in those who achieved >75%
reduction in proteinuria (P=0.04, Figure 1C). A borderline
improvement in overall survival was found in patients
with 0 to ≤75% proteinuria reduction (n=50) as compared
to those (n=8) with no proteinuria reduction (79.8 months
versus 42.9 months, P=0.049). Of the 48 patients with
>95% reduction in proteinuria, the proteinuria was nor￾malized in 58.3%. Their overall survival was similar (not
reached, P=0.40). ROC analysis suggested that patients
with proteinuria <231 mg/day had the best overall sur￾vival [P=0.01, OR = 7.47 (CI 1.63 – 34.7)].
Previously, a rise of Scr >25% was an exclusion criterion
for renal response. In this study, 24.1% of patients had a
>25% rise in Scr (with a minimum of 0.5 mg/dL). There
was an inverse relationship between proteinuria reduction
and having a Scr >25%, P<0.001 (Table 2). An increase of
>25% in Scr was associated with inferior overall survival

in the univariate analysis, although in the multivariate
analysis, a >25% increase in Scr no longer had an impact
on overall survival (P=0.13) in patients who had >75%
reduction in proteinuria (P<0.001).
To understand how hematologic response affected renal
response, the relationship between hematologic response
and proteinuria reduction was explored. As the depth of
hematologic response increased, so did the percentage of
patients with current renal response (Table 3). Of the
patients with a complete response 73.7% and 52.6% of
patients achieved a >75% and >95% reduction in protein￾uria, respectively. Only 25% of patients with a partial
response had a >75% reduction in proteinuria and no
patient with less than very good partial response had a
>95% reduction in proteinuria. There was no difference in
the rate of achieving a >75% reduction in proteinuria
between patients who had a partial response or no
response (P=0.16). There were, however, differences in
the rates of achieving a >75% reduction in proteinuria
between patients who had achieved a very good partial
response versus no response (P=0.03) and complete
response versus very good partial response (P=0.002). A
ROC curve was used to determine the optimal hematolog￾ic response to ensure a renal response. Using a >75%
reduction in proteinuria as the target, it was found that a
>81% reduction of the involved sFLC (P=0.001) or > 86%
reduction in dFLC (P=0.004) was needed to produce the
reduction in proteinuria. Additionally, a sFLC <28.1 mg/L
(odds ratio 1.07, CI 1.01 – 1.20, P=0.008) or a dFLC <7.45
mg/L (OR 1.09 CI 1.02 – 1.24, P=0.005) was associated
with an increased frequency of achieving >75% reduction
in proteinuria. As in previous studies, overall survival was
associated with depth of hematologic response (Figure 2).
However, only patients with a very good partial response
did not have significantly better overall survival than
patients with a partial response (P=0.14). Otherwise, over￾all survival was significantly longer for patients with a
complete response than for those with a very good partial
response (P=0.004) and, likewise, for those with a partial
response compared to patients with no response
(P<0.001).
Parameters of hematologic response and renal response
were significantly associated with overall survival. In uni￾variate analysis, proteinuria reduction (P<0.001), sFLC
reduction (P=0.01), dFLC reduction (P<0.001), <25%
increase in Scr (P=0.003), hematologic response (P<0.001)
and a 50% proteinuria reduction within 24 months of

treatment (P=0.03) were associated with better overall sur￾vival. In the multivariate analysis using a proportional
hazard model, dFLC reduction (P=0.02) and proteinuria
reduction (P=0.02) were independent predictors of overall
survival. If the depth of hematologic response was consid￾ered, then very good partial response or better (P=0.001)
and >75% reduction in proteinuria (P=0.001) were inde￾pendent predictors of overall survival (Figure 3). Elevation
in Scr did not have a significant effect in the multivariate
analysis in any of the models.
Discussion
One of the biggest differences between AL and multiple
myeloma is in the sequelae of the plasma cell disorder.
Patients with AL die of organ failure, particularly heart
failure, whereas patients with multiple myeloma die of
bone marrow failure and its consequences, including
infection. It is, therefore, important to realize that while
hematologic response is a primary endpoint in the treat￾ment of both AL and MM, the ultimate goal of treatment
in AL is organ response. Achievement of a complete
response is associated with a higher rate of organ
response, but by no means is it a guarantee nor is it always
necessary. Accurate assessment of organ response is cru￾cial for the monitoring and decision making on the treat￾ment of these patients.
The results of our study confirmed that renal response
remains an excellent marker of overall survival. Patients
who achieved a renal response had a significantly longer
overall survival than those who did not. More detailed
evaluation revealed some discrepancies between our
results and the current renal response criteria. First, even
though it appeared that reduction of proteinuria by >50%
was associated with better overall survival, the improve￾ment in overall survival was limited to patients with a
>75% reduction in proteinuria. In fact, the overall survival
of patients who had a >50% but ≤75% reduction in pro￾teinuria was similar to that of patients with a <50% pro￾teinuria reduction. Moreover, a further improvement in
overall survival was observed in those who had a >95%
proteinuria reduction, suggesting that there are different
levels of response. Finally, while there was an association
between increase in Scr and poorer outcomes in the uni￾variate analysis, in the multivariate analysis a rise of Scr of
>25% did not affect survival in those patients who had a
>75% reduction in proteinuria. To achieve a renal
response, patients must first achieve a hematologic
response. Deeper hematologic responses translated into
higher rates of achieving a >75% reduction in proteinuria.
The highest rate of proteinuria reduction was seen in
patients with complete responses. ROC analysis revealed
a reduction in sFLC and dFLC by >86% was strongly asso￾ciated with a >75% reduction in proteinuria. Reducing the
involved sFLC to 28.1 mg/L or the dFLC to 7.45 mg/L also
improved the odds of achieving a >75% reduction in pro￾teinuria.
These results clearly showed that a gradation of renal
response exists. The best outcomes were observed in
those with a >95% reduction of proteinuria followed by
those with a >75% reduction. Patients who had any pro￾teinuria reduction up to 75% did better than those with￾out any reduction. This suggests that the single category
of 50% reduction in proteinuria currently in use may not
be sufficient. Obviously, these results need to be validated
in larger AL populations. If confirmed, they suggests that
the creation of a category of complete renal response
(CRenal) to describe patients with a >95% reduction in
proteinuria and a category of partial renal response
(PRenal) for those who achieve a >75% reduction in pro￾teinuria would be justified. There was also some benefit in
patients who had <75% reduction in proteinuria as com￾pared to those with no reduction and hence patients with
>50% reduction could be categorized as having a minimal
renal response (MRenal). The use of 50% reduction in pro￾teinuria would hopefully reduce biological and laboratory
variations.
The analyses also showed that a rise in Scr (>25%) did
not negatively affect overall survival in patients once they
achieved a >75% reduction in proteinuria. One way to
interpret this is that reductions in proteinuria by >75%

can overcome the negative impact of a rise in Scr.
However, an alternative explanation is that a proteinuria
reduction of >75% strongly indicates that the kidney is
recovering from the deleterious effects of amyloidosis.
Thus, the elevation in Scr is unlikely to be due to AL and
would not have the same impact on survival as progres￾sion of AL. Again, confirmation of this would require
changes to the 2005 criteria.
Patients who achieved a hematologic very good partial
response or better were more likely to have better out￾comes than those with a partial response or less. Despite
that, a >75% reduction in proteinuria was an independent
predictor of survival in these patients. This again empha￾sizes the importance of organ response in order to guide
treatment. In some patients, a deeper hematologic
response may be required in order to achieve organ
response. Recently, the National Amyloidosis Center in
London reported that a >90% reduction of dFLC was
associated with a higher probability of renal response.
11
This was similar to results of a previous study in which it
was found that a sFLC reduction of >90% was equivalent
to a complete response.
12 These findings resemble ours as
reductions of >81% of sFLC and >86% of dFLC were
needed to achieve adequate reduction of proteinuria.
Several limitations of our study should be highlighted.
First and foremost is the nature of the organ response. An
organ response takes time and, therefore, the patient
must live long enough for it to occur. In this population,
the median time for a 50% reduction in proteinuria was
11 months. We, therefore, chose to include only those
patients that had more than 12 months of follow-up and
excluded those who died or developed end-stage renal
disease within the first 12 months. While it is possible
that a small number of these patients may have achieved
some renal response before they died, based on our pre￾vious study the number would be extremely low.
3 The
renal response is dynamic and improves over time. This
study only looked at the best response after ASCT. In
some patients, the best response has yet to occur while
others had already relapsed. This study was not designed
to evaluate those patients but rather the impact that a cer￾tain renal response had on overall survival. Cardiac bio￾markers were not included in the analysis in this study.
There is no doubt that cardiac biomarkers are quite useful
as markers of response in AL, but not all patients have
cardiac involvement and this study was designed to eval￾uate whether renal response can also be used a surrogate
of response. In this regard, it performed well even with￾out input from cardiac biomarkers. Finally, these patients
all underwent ASCT. While some patients did receive
other treatments, whether our findings also apply to
patients who never undergo ASCT is not known.
In conclusion, this study confirms that renal response is
a good marker of response after treatment in AL patients.
Renal response may be useful in patients who do not have
alterations in their cardiac biomarkers and presents with
predominantly renal manifestations. Our data showed an
improvement in overall survival correlated with degree of
proteinuria reduction. A rise in Scr >25% in the setting of
proteinuria reduction was not associated with worse over￾all survival. These results suggest that refinement of the
current renal response criteria is indicated. At minimum, it
supports larger studies to confirm the findings.
