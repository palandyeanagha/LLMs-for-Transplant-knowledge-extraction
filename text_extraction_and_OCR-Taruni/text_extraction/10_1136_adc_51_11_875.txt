glomerular filtration rate from plasma creatinine concentration in children.
The relation between the true plasma creatinine concentration (Pc) and the glomerular
filtration rate corrected for body surface area (GFR/SA) was investigated in 108
individuals, and the following formula was derived: GFR/SA (ml/min per 1 * 73m2SA)
= 0 43 Ht (cm)/Pc (mg/100 ml). This formula was tested in a second group of 83
children, and its accuracy and precision was compared to the 24-hour creatinine
clearance. It was found to be superior to the creatinine clearance overall, and was as
good, even if all results involving suspect 24-hour-urine collections were eliminated
from analysis. The formula in SI usage is: GFR/SA (ml/min per 1 * 73 m2SA) = 38
Ht (cm)/PC (tZmol/l).
The estimation of glomerular filtration rate
(GFR) is of central importance in assessment of
renal function. However, the most precise methods
are too cumbersome for routine clinical use, and in
practice a compromise between accuracy and sim￾plicity has to be sought. The 24-hour creatinine
clearance (Cc) is widely used to estimate GFR,
but difficulties in the accurate collection of timed
urine samples, particularly from children, limit its
value, and even under research conditions its
reproducibility is poor (Chantler and Barratt, 1972).
Because creatinine excretion is approximately
constant, an inverse relation exists between GFR
and the plasma creatinine concentration (Pc),
and formulae for the estimation of GFR from PC
in adults have been presented (Doolan, Alpen, and
Theil, 1962; Jelliffe, 1971; Cockcroft and Gault,
1976). In healthy children, however, PC rises with
age (Donckerwolcke et al., 1970), whereas GFR,
corrected in accordance with convention for body
surface area (SA) does not do so after the age of 2
years. It is therefore apparent that the relation
between PC and GFR/SA in children must reflect
some further aspect of body size. Taking into
account the fact that creatinine excretion (UCV;
Uc = urine creatinine concentration, V = urine

flow rate) is proportional to body weight (Wt)
(Graystone, 1968), we argued that GFR/SA should
be proportional to body height (Ht) and inversely
proportional to Pc:
(i) GFR oc Cc = UcV/pc
(ii) UcV oc Wt
(iii) Wt oc cube of height (Ht3)
(iv) SA oc square of height (Ht2),
substituting the proportionalities (ii), (iii), and (iv)
in (i):
(v) GFR/SA Gc Ht/Pc = a Ht/Pc.
The same conclusion was reached empirically by
Schwartz et al. (1976).
We analysed the data from a first group of 108
individuals to estimate the proportionality constant
a, and then compared the accuracy of the estimation
of GFR from equation (v) with the 24-hour Cc in a
second group of 83 individuals; we found that the
estimate of GFR/SA from PC was as good as that
obtained from Cc.
Patients
Group I consisted of 103 children with renal disease
and 5 healthy adults; the children were between 2
months and 14 years of age, and had various renal
diseases but were not oedematous. They were in a

stable state with GFR in the range 4-200 ml/min per
1-73 m2SA. For group II, 83 children with kidney
disease consecutively admitted to the renal ward, who
had both C, and GFR determined within an 8-day
period, were identified. In both groups only the first
relevant result in each child was recorded for analysis.
Methods
GFR was estimated from the plasma clearance of 51-
chromium edetic acid (5"Cr-EDTA) after intravenous
injection. Blood samples were collected at 2 and 4
hours and GFR calculated by a single exponential analy￾sis incorporating the correction factor described by
Chantler and Barratt (1972). Surface area was derived
from height and weight using the formula of Du Bois
and Du Bois (1916) and GFR was corrected to 1-73
m2SA.
In group I, Pc was determined manually in duplicate
by the Jaffe reaction after adsorption onto an ion-ex￾change resin to remove noncreatinine chromogens
(Stoten, 1968), and also by an automated method
(Technicon, 1966). The latter method includes some
noncreatinine chromogens, and was found to over￾estimate the true creatinine concentration by 0-14
mg/100 ml+0 13 (SD). In group II only the auto￾mated method was used, and the true value for Pc
estimated by subtracting 0-14 mg/ 100 ml. Throughout
this paper, Pc refers to the true plasma creatinine
concentration.
Creatinine clearance was calculated from a single
24-hour urine collection and a single determination of
the plasma creatinine concentration by the automated
method without the correction for noncreatinine chromo￾gens. Urine creatinine concentration was measured by
the same automated method as for plasma with different
dilution factors. Urine collections were judged to be
accurate if the creatinine excretion fell within the follow￾ing limits (Ghazali and Barratt, 1974): Uc V/Wt (mg/kg
body weight per day) = 15+0 5 xAge (years) ± 6
(2SD). 26 (31%) of the 83 24-hour urine collections
failed to satisfy this criterion.
Results
Relation of Pc, Ht, and GFR/SA (group I).
The relation between PC and GFR/SA in the first
group of individuals is shown in Fig. 1. The data
have been treated logarithmically to stabilize
variances. The symbols indicate groups of patients
of different height, and the effect of height on the
relation between PC and GFR/SA is apparent.
Theoretical considerations given above suggested
the following relation: GFR/SA = a Ht/P,, which
was also indicated by the plot of log GFR/SA against
log Ht/Pc (Fig. 2). The more general forn was
first considered, GFR/SA = a HtbPcC, which is
equivalent to log GFR/SA = log a +b log Ht +c log
PC.
A multiple linear regression was undertaken.

log Ht and log PC is 0 14. This model accounted
for 87 % of the variation in log GFR/SA. Its
validity was tested by calculating and examining
the residuals, and there was good evidence that they
were normally distributed. From this analysis the
best estimate of a is 0 43. Therefore, to predict
GFR/SA from Ht and PC the relation is GFR/SA
=0*43 Ht/Pc.
The 95% confidence limits for the predicted
value of GFR/SA are 0 43 Ht/Pc10±028, i.e. 52 and

indicating an underestimate by CcISA. However,
when the 26 estimates with inadequate urine collec￾tion were excluded, dB was not significantly different
from zero.
The variances of dA and dB were compared as for
a paired sample (see for example Armitage, 1971).
When the 26 individuals were excluded as above,
there was no significant difference between them
(P >0 2), but when all 83 individuals were con￾sidered the variance of dB was significantly greater
than that of dA (P <0 001). This analysis implies
that 0 - 43 Ht/Pc as an estimate of GFR/SA is
superior to CC/SA overall, and is just as good even
when criteria are applied to exclude estimates of
CCJSA based on 24-hour urine collections of dubious
adequacy.
Discussion
This study shows that measurement of Pc
provides a simple and reliable method of estimating
GFR in children, provided that height is taken into
consideration. The formula GFR/SA (ml/min per
1.73 m2SA) = 0 43 Ht (cm)/Pc (mg/100 ml), is
based on the true plasma creatinine concentration;
using the commonly available automated method,
0 - 14 mg/100 ml should be subtracted to allow for
noncreatinine chromogens. If SI units are used,
and plasma creatinine concentration expressed in
,umol/l, the formula should be rewritten: GFR/SA
(ml/min per 1-73 m2SA) = 38 Ht (cm)/Pc (,umol/l)
and 12-4 ,umol/l should be subtracted from the
automated estimates of Pc.
Our statistical analysis has shown that this method
of estimating GFR is as accurate and as precise as
measuring the 24-hour Cc, even when urine is
collected on a ward specializing in the care of children
with renal disease, and when results are eliminated if
the creatinine excretion does not fall within the nor￾mal range, implying erroneous urine collections.
Our conclusion, therefore, is that the 24-hour Cc
should be abandoned as an estimate of GFR in
children except in special circumstances such as
emaciation were creatinine production may be low,
in changing states where the actual PC does not
represent the equilibrium value, and in special
tests where Cc can be used as an internal reference
clearance. It is possible, however, that greater
precision may be obtained with shorter urine collec￾tions for measurement of Cc, but we have not
examined this point.
Schwartz et al. (1976) have undertaken a similar
analysis to our own, and present the formula:
GFR/SA (ml/min per 1-73 m2SA) = 0 55 length
(cm)/Pc (mg/100 ml). The difference between
their value of 0 - 55 and ours of 0 - 43 can be explained
by the fact that they did not measure true plasma
creatinine concentration, and used the inulin clear￾ance as reference estimate of GFR.
It should be recognized, however, that the error of
estimation of GFR/SA from Pc is large, the 95%
confidence limits being 52-190%. Nevertheless,
measurement of 24-hour Cc does not reduce this
error, and if more precise estimates of GFR are
necessary, other methods, such as the plasma
clearance of 51Cr-EDTA should be used.
