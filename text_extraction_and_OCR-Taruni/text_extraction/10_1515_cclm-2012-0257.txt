Abstract 
 Serum creatinine does not share the properties of an ideal 
marker of glomerular fi ltration rate (GFR) like inulin, but 
continues to be the most widely used endogenous marker 
of GFR. In the search of a better biomarker of GFR, the 
small molecular weight protein cystatin C has been intro￾duced with features more similar to that of inulin, such as 
constant production and no non-renal elimination. However, 
it has not enjoyed widespread use despite its signifi cantly 
improved diagnostic performance in the detection of 
impaired GFR and its independence of body composition. A 
variety of formulae based on either cystatin C or creatinine 
or both have been developed to estimate GFR. We summa￾rize the currently used methods of GFR measurement, their 
limitations and analytical errors. The review also summa￾rizes the history, features and the feasibility of cystatin C 
measurements as well as the most widely used formulae for 
the estimation of GFR in children. The diagnostic perfor￾mance of the cystatin C derived eGFR formulae at various 
levels of GFR is also discussed. An eGFR formula derived 
from pooled studies analyzing both creatinine and cystatin 
C, and using a biology-based mathematical approach may 
be advantageous.

Introduction 
 It is widely accepted that kidney function is best measured as 
glomerular fi ltration rate (GFR) (1) . GFR cannot be measured 
directly. However, if a substance in the plasma is in a stable 
concentration, physiologically inert, and freely fi ltered at 
the glomerulus, but is not secreted, reabsorbed, synthesized, 
or metabolized by the kidney, the amount of that substance 
fi ltered at the glomerulus is equal to the amount excreted in 
the urine (2) . The gold standard for the GFR measurement is 
inulin clearance (3) . In 1934, Richards found that the polysac￾charide inulin (a fructose polymer made from the Jerusalem 
artichoke) is freely fi ltered through collodion membranes but 
not absorbed, while studying water reabsorption in the renal 
tubule of amphibians (4) . Inulin shares many features of an 
ideal marker of glomerular fi ltration, namely exclusive elimi￾nation by glomerular clearance with no tubular secretion and 
no non-renal excretion (5) . 
Inulin clearance 
 Inulin clearance is widely regarded as the gold standard for 
measuring GFR. The classic method of measuring inulin 
clearance requires an intravenous infusion with timed urine 
collections over a period of several hours. This is costly and 
cumbersome. In the traditional way developed by Homer 
Smith (6) , an inulin bolus is given intravenously to increase 
the concentration in the extra-cellular water that needs to be 
equilibrated. This is then followed by an intravenous infu￾sion for a period of several hours until a steady concentration 
in the plasma is obtained. In clinical practice, this is rarely 
achieved because the amount of inulin infused has to be esti￾mated using surrogate markers of the renal function. This 
process can over- or under-estimate the amount of inulin that 
is required. Accurate urine collections are necessary over a 
period of a few hours. Ideally, the bladder should be catheter￾i zed and emptied, and saline washout and air displacement 
should be used at the end of each collection period. To mini￾mize collection errors, several collection periods are required, 
typically three times per hour. In addition, there are consid￾erable diffi culties with the measurement of inulin. Reliable 
methods using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chro￾matography have only been published after the millennium 
 (7) . Because measuring inulin clearance is cumbersome and 
there are methodological problems with its accurate measure￾ments and high inter- and intra-assay variability if methods 
other than mass spectrometry are used (5) , alternate methods 
of measuring GFR have been developed.

Nuclear medicine GFR methods 
 Nuclear medicine techniques of GFR estimation have been in 
use as a replacement for inulin clearance since the 1970s (2) . 
The main advantage of using a radiolabeled compound with 
characteristics that are similar to inulin is its immediate deter￾mination by counting the radioactivity. Today ’ s nuclear medi￾cine methods form a new standard for GFR measurements 
because of its easily assayed, radiolabeled and stable com￾pounds that meet the criteria of a good GFR marker, namely 
clearance only by glomerular fi ltration without tubular secre￾tion and extra-renal elimination. The most widely used single 
bolus-injection technique utilizes the intravenous injection 
of a suitable compound at a precisely known quantity. It is 
important that no material is injected interstitially and all mat￾ter enters the intravascular space, which may be particularly 
challenging in the case of young children. Extravasation will 
cause signifi cant overestimation of GFR (8) . After the injec￾tion, the plasma is sampled from the opposite arm. The mea￾sured concentrations are plotted against time (Figure 1 ). 
 The different substances used for nuclear medicine GFR 
measurement are listed in Table 1 . 
 The accuracy of the subsequent calculations are affected by 
a number of factors, in particular the exact time and the fre￾quency of the sampling. It is generally recognized that at least 
three sampling points are required (22) . Unfortunately, there 
is poor standardization amongst most centers, and only two￾point sampling time points are chosen to reduce the number 
of venipunctures in children. 
 Furthermore, most centers utilize only one-compartmental 
models. A single compartmental model results in some over￾estimation of GFR (23) . Late sampling (4 and/or 5 hour con￾centrations after injection) could overcome this problem (24) , 
but is rarely implemented. For a more accurate assessment 
of the extracellular water (especially important in children 
with altered fl uid status, for instance if they are on long-term

extracellular volume. 
diuretics), an early sampling point is required (25) . Also, if 
one-compartmental model is utilized, appropriate corrections 
for the overestimation should be employed (26) . 
What are the particular problems with GFR 
measurement in children ? 
 The body of a child is in constant change. To accommodate for 
this change, GFR is normalized to body surface area, which 
is considered to be the best denominator, although the extra￾cellular volume is also considered (27) . While all nephrons 
are terminally differentiated at birth, only the juxtaglomerular 
glomeruli are used at birth and there is continuous recruitment 
of additional glomeruli until 18 – 24 months of age. Ideally, 
GFR should be reported as age-independent z-scores, rather 
than as absolute GFR or GFR/body surface area (28) . In the 
fi rst year of life, and during puberty, there are growth spurts 
and rapid increase of muscle mass, requiring special consid￾erations for the calculation of GFR (29) , especially in ado￾lescent males (30) . The most important determinant of GFR 
is height, which when taken into account led to the famous 
Schwartz formula (31) , a GFR estimation model based on 
the height creatinine ratio. Gold-standard measurements of 
GFR are cumbersome and invasive, and those children at risk 
requiring frequent GFR monitoring, such as transplant recipi￾ents (32) are already subject to numerous other tests. As such, 
accurate non-invasive measurements of GFR are essential, 
and endogenous markers are required. 
Endogenous surrogate markers of GFR 
 The earlier stated methods of inulin clearance and nuclear 
medicine methods are invasive and involve undesirable 
effects, such as radiation exposure or the need for multiple 
blood samples and urinary catheterization. Therefore, it has 
become a preferred practice to use an endogenous marker 
that is produced at a constant rate, shares the features of inu￾lin, and thus eliminates the need for a compound injection. 
Popper and Mandel proposed the use of serum creatinine in 
1937 (33) , which remains to be the most widely used marker 
for GFR estimation in spite of its shortcomings. This marker 
remains the most widely used marker for estimation of GFR. 
Where serum endogenous markers are considered as suitable 
markers of GFR, the National Kidney Foundation guidelines 
recommend the use of serum marker based prediction equa￾tions for GFR estimation and rules against the use of serum 
markers alone in the assessment of renal function, as dis￾cussed in ref. (34) . 
Limitations of serum creatinine as endogenous 
marker of GFR 
 Serum creatinine is the most widely used endogenous marker 
to predict GFR. Creatinine is a metabolic product of creatine 
and phosphocreatine found in muscle and as such refl ects 

Filler et al.: Cystatin C and related formulae in pediatrics 2083
muscle mass and varies little from day to day (35) . Serum 
creatinine measurement is widely available at low cost. 
However, while creatinine may be a feasible marker of GFR 
in populations with near normal GFR, it has multiple limi￾tations for individuals. There is substantial inter- and intra￾patient variability due to differences in muscle mass (36) . In 
childhood, there is age and muscle mass dependency of serum 
creatinine and accurate assessment of normal GFR even with 
the use of body length/creatinine ratios (see below) remains 
diffi cult. In certain pediatric patient clientele, such as patients 
with spina bifi da (37) , neuromuscular disease, anorexia ner￾vosa, or liver cirrhosis, serum creatinine is completely unus￾able because of the abnormal muscle mass in these children 
who are often wheelchair bound (38, 39) . In addition, the 
production of creatinine is not constant; the rate of turnover 
is also variable (40) . It is also known that creatinine is also 
undergoing tubular secretion (41) . Creatinine is secreted in 
the proximal convoluted tubule by active transport similar to 
that of organic cations. Tubular secretion of creatinine divided 
by inulin clearance increases progressively from 0.16 in adult 
patients with normal GFR to 0.92 in patients with GFR < 40 
mL/min (12) . Furthermore, there used to be considerable 
variability in the reference range for serum creatinine based 
on the method used for its determination (42, 43) . Profi ciency 
testing surveys published periodically by the College of 
American Pathologists, evaluated the variability in creatinine 
measurement among various methods used by different insti￾tutions across the US and demonstrated substantial variability 
 (44) . This will make the validation of older methods to esti￾mate GFR based on serum creatinine, measured by different 
techniques, subject to debate. Only more recently, the trace￾ability of the creatinine measurements to higher-order refer￾ence methods [isotope dilution-mass spectrometry (IDMS) 
reference method] improved accuracy of creatinine measure￾ments (45) . This paper established improved pediatric refer￾ence intervals that may be adopted by any laboratory serving 
a similar population (predominantly Caucasian). Clinical 
implications of creatinine standardization have recently been 
reviewed (46) . 
 Overall, the method used for serum creatinine is of high 
importance. Calculation of GFR based on serum creatinine 
measured by the alkaline picrate method is limited because 
of method non-specifi city, low values in children, particularly 
in infants, and lack of appropriate GFR formulae. Therefore, 
enzymatic methods are preferred, as widely suggested in the 
literature (47) . 
 However, the problem of tubular secretion of serum cre￾atinine cannot be addressed with the methodology of mea￾surement. Approximately a decade ago, blockade with H2 
antagonists revealed promising results that may overcome the 
signifi cant problem of tubular secretion of serum creatinine 
 (48, 49) . The use of cimetidine protocols in children remains 
scarce (50) . Creatinine clearance determinations involving 
timed urine collections may provide greater accuracy but are 
diffi cult for pediatric patients to perform, time-consuming, 
and impractical for routine use. Only recently small molecu￾lar proteins have emerged as potentially superior endogenous 
markers of GFR (51) . 
Small molecular weight proteins as markers of 
GFR 
 Small molecular mass proteins have long been proposed as 
markers of GFR as they are normally almost freely fi ltered 
through the normal glomerular membrane (52, 53) . In a 
normally functioning kidney these small molecular weight 
proteins should then be almost completely reabsorbed and 
degraded by the proximal tubular cells. Several proteins have 
been tested, such as β-2 microglobulin and β -trace protein 
[analyzed in children in ref. (13) ], however, of all these mark￾ers, cystatin C appears to be the most promising. 
What is cystatin C ? 
 Cystatin C is a small molecular weight protein that was ini￾tially known as γ – trace protein. The amino acid sequence of 
the single polypeptide chain of human cystatin C was deter￾mined in 1981 (54) . Two years later, cystatin C was identifi ed 
as an inhibitor of cysteine proteases after discovering signifi -
cant homology with the sequence of chicken cystatin – both 
proteins had a sequence identity of 44 % (55) . 
 Cystatin C is produced by all human nucleated cells, since 
immunochemical and Northern blot studies of human tissues 
and cell lines have shown that cystatin C and/or its mRNA is 
present in all investigated cell types (56) . Likewise, investi￾gations of the production of cystatin C by human cell lines in 
culture have displayed that all cell lines that were investigated 
all secrete cystatin C (57) . Determination of the structure of 
the human cystatin C gene and its promoter has demonstrated 
that the gene is of the house-keeping type, which indicates

a stable production rate of cystatin C by most nucleated cell 
types (56) . Earlier studies of the serum level of cystatin C in 
large patient cohorts have failed to correlate the serum level 
to any pathophysiological state besides those affecting the 
glomerular fi ltration rate, which also is compatible with a 
stable secretion of cystatin C from most human tissues (58) . 
However, very large doses of glucocorticoids have recently 
been described to increase the production of cystatin C (59, 
60) whereas low and medium doses of glucocorticoids do not 
seem to alter the production of cystatin C (61) . Also, thyroid 
dysfunction can affect cystatin C levels (62) , but our group 
found no association with thyroid function markers in recent 
studies (63, 64) . 
 The reference values for cystatin C obtained in a carefully 
selected population are 0.75 ± 0.09 mg/L for children aged 
4 – 19 years, 0.74 ± 0.10 mg/L for males and 0.65 ± 0.09 mg/L 
for females (aged 20 – 59 years), and 0.83 ± 0.10 mg/L for older 
individuals ( > or = 60 years) (65) . In the fi rst year of life, renal 
function matures physiologically. Accordingly, much higher 
cystatin C values up to 2.8 mg/L were found at birth. These 
are subject to a rapid decline after birth refl ecting maturation 
of kidney function (66) . Age dependency also has to be con￾sidered in adults. New reference intervals with more detailed 
age distribution from central Europe have recently been pub￾lished on 985 healthy subjects older than 25 years (67) . 
 Studies of the handling of human cystatin C in rats have 
shown that the plasma renal clearance of cystatin C is 94 % 
of that of the generally used GFR-marker 51 Cr-EDTA and that 
cystatin C thus is practically freely fi ltered in the glomeruli 
 (68) . At least 99 % of the fi ltered cystatin C is degraded in 
the tubular cells. When the GFR of a set of rats was variably 
lowered by constricting their aortas above the renal arteries, 
the renal plasma clearance of cystatin C correlated strongly 
with that of 51 Cr-EDTA with a linear regression coeffi cient of 
0.99 and with the y-intercept not being statistically different 
from 0 (69) . 
 After these encouraging studies, additional studies sug￾gested that the reciprocal of cystatin C correlates better with 
a gold standard GFR measurement than the reciprocal of 
serum creatinine (70 – 72) . Cystatin C as a marker of GFR 
was found to be independent of body composition (36, 73, 
74) . Development of automated and rapid particle-enhanced 
immunoturbidimetric and immunonephelometric meth￾ods, also more precise than the original radioimmuno- or 
enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays (75, 76) , has allowed 
large-scale use of serum cystatin C as a clinically useful GFR￾marker (76) . 
 The diagnostic performance of cystatin C in compari￾son with serum creatinine was fi rst analyzed in 2002 with a 
meta-analysis of 46 studies, in both adults and children (77) . 
The pooled data analysis compared correlation coeffi cients 
between GFR and the reciprocals of serum creatinine and 
cystatin C in 3703 individuals and found signifi cantly bet￾ter correlations (mean r = 0.816 [95 % confi dence interval (CI) 
0.804 – 0.826] vs. mean r = 0.742 [95 % CI 0.726 – 0.758]). ROC 
plots were available for a pooled sample size of 997 individu￾als, again showing a signifi cantly better area under the [ROC] 
curve (mean = 0.926 [95 % CI 0.892 – 0.960] vs. mean r = 0.837 
[95 % CI 0.796 – 0.878]). This meta-analysis suggests that 
cystatin C is superior to serum creatinine for the detection 
of impaired GFR in cross-sectional studies. More recently, 
another meta-analysis from 24 studies (n = 2007) also con￾fi rmed that the diagnostic accuracy favored cystatin C (78) , 
although in this more recent study, the diagnostic odds ratios 
started to overlap, most probably due to the IDMS testing of 
serum creatinine. 
The need for standardization of cystatin C, 
similar to the IDMS traceability of serum 
creatinine 
 It should be highlighted that problems due to lack of stan￾dardization of cystatin C lead to similar problems as was 
highlighted above with regards to serum creatinine and the 
need for IDMS traceability (45) . Results obtained with the 
two main assays that are commercially available, namely 
the DAKO kit (turbidimetric, PETIA) and the Siemens 
Healthcare assay (nephelometric, PENIA), can be quite dif￾ferent, as recently demonstrated with the publication of ref￾erence intervals for healthy term and preterm infants. The 
results with the PENIA method in our study (79) were sig￾nifi cantly lower than those reported by Harmoinen et al. (80) . 
Similar problems occurred when the results of the CKiD 
study were re-analyzed using PENIA, which lead to substan￾tially better results (81) . Recently, Anders Grubb reported the 
fi rst certifi ed standardized reference material for cystatin C 
 (82) . World-wide standardization, as just shown in the pre￾vious paragraph, is a powerful tool towards improving the 
diagnostic accuracy of GFR biomarkers, and the authors of 
this review are convinced that standardization of cystatin C 
similar to that of creatinine will further enhance the diag￾nostic performance of cystatin C. 
Endogenous markers as basis for GFR 
estimation models 
 Studies have continuously reported the accuracy of serum 
endogenous marker based GFR estimation models in mea￾suring GFR over the serum levels of such markers alone 
 (34) . As such, numerous GFR estimation models have been 
developed to estimate GFR using creatinine and cystatin C as 
base markers. Some of these formulae where either creatinine 
based, cystatin C based or formed by a combination of both 
markers. 
Estimating GFR using creatinine 
 First and foremost, creatinine standardization is of paramount 
importance to account for the analytical variability of differ￾ent creatinine methods. The various formulae cannot be com￾pared if the creatinine measurements are not standardized (46) . 
Fortunately, the National Kidney Disease Education Program 
(NKDEP), the College of American Pathologists (CAP), and 

Filler et al.: Cystatin C and related formulae in pediatrics 2085
the National Institute for Standard and Technology (NIST) 
have collaborated to prepare a serum-creatinine reference 
material (NIST 967) with demonstrated commutability with 
native clinical specimens in routine methods. These materials 
are value-assigned with the gas chromatography-isotope dilu￾tion mass spectrometry (GC-IDMS) and liquid chromatog￾raphy (LC)-IDMS reference measurement procedures (83) . 
Nearly all clinical laboratory methods are now expected to 
have calibration traceable to an IDMS reference measurement 
procedure, which may lead to better formulae for the estima￾tion of GFR. 
 A wide range of creatinine based formulae were devel￾oped over the years to estimate GFR. The most commonly 
used creatinine based formulae are the Cockcroft-Gault 
 (84) , the Modifi cation of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) 
formula (85) , which later was replaced with a four-variable 
version and adjusted for standardized creatinine (86) and the 
chronic kidney disease-epidemiology collaboration CKD￾EPI formula (87) . The (CKD-EPI) equation was reported 
to perform with higher level of accuracy than the MDRD 
equation (87) . 
 In the case of children, the most widely-used formula is 
the Schwartz-formula (31) together with modifi cations for 
adolescent boys (30) and infants (29) . The Counahan-Barratt 
formula may be slightly more suitable for GFR estimation 
based on serum creatinine in children (88, 89) . 
 It should be emphasized that adult formulae cannot be used 
in children. This was shown clearly for the Cockcroft-Gault 
formula (90) and the MDRD formula (91) . The bias worsens 
with younger age. The literature on validation of the CKD-EPI 
formula in children remains scarce. One study of 850 children 
and adults aged 5 – 95 years comes to the conclusion that the 
formula should not be used for children and youth (92) . 
 Recently, the Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKid) 
study recruited a cohort of approximately 600 children with 
chronic kidney disease in the USA and Canada that involved 
creatinine being referenced to IDMS (93) . This has led to an 
improved Schwartz formula (21) . 
 The commonly used creatinine based GFR estimation for￾mulae are summarized in Table 2 , some of which were also 
derived for children. 
Estimating GFR using cystatin C 
 Recent research has reported cystatin C to be less dependent 
on muscle mass than creatinine and as a result simpler GFR 
prediction equations were derived from cystatin C compared 
to creatinine (13, 70, 96) . These models proved to give a more 
accurate and precise measurement of GFR than creatinine 
based equations with less bias, irrespective of anthropometric 
data, especially in identifying patients with GFR below 60 
mL/min/1.73 m 2
 (97) . Cystatin C based estimation formulae 
were also shown to correctly classify CKD patients in 61.5 % –
 72.0 % compared to 62.1 % – 64 % of the creatinine based for￾mula (97) . Some authors have also suggested replacing the 
classic Schwartz formula with GFR calculated from serum 
cystatin C in children since serum cystatin C concentrations 
are only slightly overestimated while creatinine levels show 
considerable bias (98) . 
 One important aspect is that pediatric formulae based on 
cystatin C work well in adults, as could be shown for both 
the Filler formula (98) , which was prospectively validated in 
a cohort of adult renal transplant recipients (99) , and Anders 
Grubb ’ s formula GFR = 84.69 × cystatin C (mg/L) − 1.680 × 1.384 
(if child < 14 years) (91) . 
 In contrast, a large number of different cystatin C based 
prediction models were produced using a plethora of different 
mathematical models, with the inclusion of different clinical 
variables, variable methods for the measurement of cysta￾tin C, variations in cystatin C calibrators, and the different 
ethnical backgrounds (100) . Perhaps the most striking differ￾ences of the accuracy of different formulae occurred when 
the same patients were compared using turbidimetric (21) vs. 
nephelometric methods (81) . Based on that study it appears 
that the Siemens Healthcare cystatin C nephelometry assay

may be preferable. There is a need for the development of 
a standardized cystatin C based GFR prediction model (97) . 
Certainly, the recently developed standardized reference mate￾rial for cystatin C forms a most important step towards this 
goal (82) . 
 The commonly used cystatin C based GFR estimation for￾mulae are summarized in Table 3some of which were also

the measured and estimated GFR with 90.1 % of eGFR within 
30 % of measured GFR (81) . Similarly, Zappitelli et al. also 
demonstrated the highest accuracy with a formula combining 
cystatin C and serum creatinine (107) . In adults, Tidman et 
al. also reported a greater accuracy for GFR estimation using 
combined models than the cystatin C or the Creatinine based 
estimation equations (108) . Also, the combined models have 
shown to correctly classify CKD more frequently and to have 
the best performance in those with near-normal renal func￾tion (97) . Of these well-known formulae are the Bouvet et al. 
 (101) and the Zappitelli et al. (107) in children. 
 The list of formulae for the estimation of GFR based on 
cystatin C ± serum creatinine is constantly expanding. Several 
important themes emerge when comparing the various 
formulae:
• Some formulae are based on cystatin C alone. These for￾mulae are convenient and do not require any additional data 
in most cases. Some of them have been prospectively vali￾dated in adults and in children (99) . 
• Some formulae use both creatinine and cystatin C (21, 107) . 
These formulae require signifi cant additional information, 
which may include height, gender and urea. Formulae that 
include creatinine require more data, such as gender, eth￾nicity etc. While formulae with cystatin C alone can be 
quite useful for both children and adults, there is not much 
point in using a formula based on both creatinine and cys￾tatin C for adults and children, similar to creatinine-based 
eGFR formulae (90) . 
• A wide variety of “ gold-standard methods ” have been em￾ployed to derive the eGFR formula. This in itself provides 
considerable bias, especially if only two sampling points 
are used (see Table 3). The proper use of two-compartmen￾tal model has been rather limited as well. 
 A very detailed analysis of these formulae was recently 
performed by our group (97) . The diagnostic accuracy of 
various cystatin C equations varies with different levels of 
GFR. We compared various cystatin C equations across 
GFR strata < 60, < 90, ≥ 135, and ≥ 150 mL/min per 1.73 m 2
for an accurate prediction and appropriate classifi cation of 
the measured GFR. The CKiD (21) , Zappitelli-CysEq (107) ,

and Zappitelli-CysCrEq (107) equations had a higher accu￾racy, estimated by eGFR values within 10 % and 30 % of the 
respective (99m)Tc DTPA, in the GFR categories < 60 and 
 < 90 mL/min per 1.73 m 2
 , whereas the B ö kenkamp (70) , 
Bouvet (101) , and Filler (98) equations had a greater accu￾racy in the GFR categories ≥ 135 and ≥ 150 mL/min per 
1.73 m 2
 . The Bouvet, CKiD, Filler, Zappitelli-CysEq, and 
Zappitelli-CysCrEq equations had a greater sensitivity to 
classify GFR < 60 and < 90 mL/min per 1.73 m 2
 , whereas the 
B ö kenkamp equation had a higher sensitivity for GFR ≥ 135 
and ≥ 150 mL/min per 1.73 m 2
 . In short, formulae always 
perform best in the range where most of the patients were 
recruited. As such, the CKiD formula (21) may be particularly 
good for patients with a GFR between 25 and 75 mL/min. 
The method of determination of cystatin C also plays an impor￾tant role. As outlined above, the re-analysis of the CKiD study 
using the Siemens Healthcare assay rather than the DAKO assay 
gave convincingly better results (81) . Given the variability in 
the performance of various equations with GFR, an ideal equa￾tion that can be applied to all remains a challenge. Short of an 
individualized approach based on GFR levels by center, further 
research on refi ning the equations should focus on data pooling, 
ensuring the quality of the gold-standard method, and choosing 
a mathematical model that best resembles the naturally occur￾ring decline of isotope measurements in the time concentration 
curve. Ideally, non-linear mixed pharmacokinetic models that 
adjust for extracorporeal volume, gender, ethnicity and age as 
well as selecting an appropriate model with the number of com￾partments should be utilized. Perhaps the Baysian approach for 
the WinNonLin derived GFR calculations employed by Bouvet 
et al. can maximize the quality of the gold-standard method of 
measuring GFR (101) . As outlined above, standardized calibra￾tion and uniformity in using cystatin C assays can improve the 
prediction by cystatin C equations (109) . 
Cystatin C as a potential marker for volume 
assessment and cardiovascular outcomes 
 In patients with chronic kidney diseases with or without dia￾lysis, their volume status is an important but diffi cult clinical 
assessment. In our recent publication, we have found that in 
patients who are on dialysis with no residual kidney function, 
the cystatin C reduction ratio per single hemodialysis treat￾ment is negatively infl uenced by ultrafi ltration rate (64) . As a 
result, cystatin C level, its volume of distribution and its kinet￾ics relating to volume status, needs to be further explored. 
 Furthermore, the current evidence explaining the biologi￾cal plausibility of the association between cystatin C levels 
and cardiovascular outcomes are scant, despite a signifi cant 
number of studies that have found strong associations in adult 
population. Likely, the mechanisms are partly due to the fact 
that cystatin C is a marker of reduced residual renal function, 
which is associated with cardiovascular outcome. However, 
in patients with cardiovascular diseases, studies have shown 
similar associations independent of residual renal function 
 (110) . A systematic review of 15 studies on “ cardiovascular 
disease and cystatin C ” showed that cystatin C level > 1.3 
mg/L is a risk factor for the occurrence of fatal and non-fatal 
cardiovascular events (111) . Furthermore, recently published 
studies have provided some possible explanations to the 
mechanisms of cystatin C leading to an increase in cardio￾vascular diseases. Cystatin C is a base proteinase inhibitor 
and is produced by all nucleated cells. Xie et al. demonstrated 
that oxidants induce cystatin C elevation. Cystatin C regu￾lates Cathepsin B activity and its elevation can affect cardiac 
extracellular remodelling (112) . In addition, there is a positive 
association between cystatin C and monocyte levels which 
can lead to atherosclerosis (113) . One might argue that arth￾erosclerosis is not prevalent among children with chronic kid￾ney disease, however, there clearly is evidence for vascular 
disease with media calcifi cations in these patients, leading to 
the major cause of death (32) . Finally, Funayama et al. have 
shown that cystatin C level is an independent predictor for 
vasospastic angina (114) . Clearly, these studies have demon￾strated some of the possible mechanisms by which this impor￾tant marker can lead to increased cardiovascular diseases and 
alter left ventricular mass. More studies are therefore needed. 
Therefore, cystatin C can be an important marker for both 
assessing kidney function and predicting cardiovascular out￾comes. The infl uence of these cardiovascular morbidities on 
the variability of both creatinine and cystatin C levels as well 
as the accuracy of eGFR estimations has been understudied. 
Limitations of prediction equations 
 Although prediction equations have shown to be more accu￾rate estimators of GFR than the serum levels of the markers 
alone, these prediction equations tend to have limitations to 
their use. Prediction equations have shown to represent only 
the relationship between the marker and its non-GFR deter￾minants (74) . They also vary across populations and over 
time which would yield inaccurate estimations when applied 
to different populations from the one used in developing these 
formulae (81) . The use of prediction equations may also be 
limited by other laboratory factors, such as the different cali￾brators used in determining the cystatin C blood levels, non￾accurate methods for cystatin C determination, and the higher 
cost associated with cystatin C in the case of the cystatin C 
based equations (115) . If one is to control for these varying 
parameters, a universal model can be developed using the 
appropriate statistical approach. 
Conclusions 
 In summary, gold standard GFR measurements are cumber￾some and invasive. It is without doubt that cystatin C offers 
signifi cant advantages over serum creatinine as endogenous 
markers of GFR. The Schwartz formula is a good estimate of 
GFR in children with normal body composition, but for more 
accurate assessment across the lower levels of GFR, the CKiD 
or Filler or Zappitelli formula offers signifi cant advantages. In 
certain conditions, such as spina bifi da patients, only cystatin 
C-derived eGFR correlates with measured GFR. Signifi cant

variability exists with regards to high quality of the “ gold￾standard GFR measurement ” across the various studies. Very 
few centers use appropriate sampling frequency and appropri￾ate two-compartmental models to determine the GFR. The pre￾analytical error related to the body composition, anthropometry 
variability, body surface area calculation vs. extra-cellular vol￾ume and intra- and inter-patient variability of the GFR measure￾ments has been understudied. This also applies to the effect of 
the patient cohort ’ s GFR range on the diagnostic performance 
of the various formulae. The best approach towards a better 
formula for worldwide use would be the pooling of data to gen￾erate more robust formulae with appropriate validation cohorts. 
The importance of standardization and calibration of the cysta￾tin C assays also cannot be underestimated. Nonetheless, of all 
endogenous markers, cystatin C appears to be the best surro￾gate for GFR and it is hoped that serum creatinine be combined 
or replaced for the estimation of GFR in children.
