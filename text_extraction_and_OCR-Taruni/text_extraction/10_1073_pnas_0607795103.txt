Abstract
Maintaining muscle size and fiber composition requires contractile
activity. Increased activity stimulates expression of the
transcriptional coactivator PGC-1alpha (peroxisome proliferator-
activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha), which promotes
fiber-type switching from glycolytic toward more oxidative fibers.
In response to disuse or denervation, but also in fasting and many
systemic diseases, muscles undergo marked atrophy through a
common set of transcriptional changes. FoxO family transcription
factors play a critical role in this loss of cell protein, and when
activated, FoxO3 causes expression of the atrophy-related ubiquitin
ligases atrogin-1 and MuRF-1 and profound loss of muscle mass. To
understand how exercise might retard muscle atrophy, we
investigated the possible interplay between PGC-1alpha and the
FoxO family in regulation of muscle size. Rodent muscles showed a
large decrease in PGC-1alpha mRNA during atrophy induced by
denervation as well as by cancer cachexia, diabetes, and renal
failure. Furthermore, in transgenic mice overexpressing
PGC-1alpha, denervation and fasting caused a much smaller
decrease in muscle fiber diameter and a smaller induction of
atrogin-1 and MuRF-1 than in control mice. Increased expression of
PGC-1alpha also increased mRNA for several genes involved in
energy metabolism whose expression decreases during atrophy.
Transfection of PGC-1alpha into adult fibers reduced the capacity of
FoxO3 to cause fiber atrophy and to bind to and transcribe from the
atrogin-1 promoter. Thus, the high levels of PGC-1alpha in dark and
exercising muscles can explain their resistance to atrophy, and the
rapid fall in PGC-1alpha during atrophy should enhance the FoxO-
dependent loss of muscle mass.
