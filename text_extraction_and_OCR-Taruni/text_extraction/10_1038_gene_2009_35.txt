Over 30 years ago, receptors for the Fc region of IgG (FcgR) were implicated in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE). Since those pioneering studies, our knowledge of the structure and function of these FcgRs has
increased dramatically. We now know that FcgR contributes to the regulation of acquired immunity and to the regulation of
innate immune responses where FcgRs act as specific receptors for innate opsonins (CRP and SAP). Our understanding of the
genomic architecture of the genes encoding the FcgR has also witnessed remarkable advances. Numerous functionally
relevant single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants and copy number (CN) variants have been characterized in the FcgR
genes. Many of these variants have also been shown to associate with risk to development of SLE and some have been
associated with disease progression. This review will provide an overview of the FcgR in relation to SLE, including
consideration of the role of genetic variants in FcgR in SLE pathogenesis. The difficulties in assessing genetic variation in these
genes will be discussed. To enhance our understanding of the functional roles of these receptors in SLE, future research will
need to integrate our knowledge of SNP variants, CN variants and the functional diversity of these receptors.

Introduction
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypic
autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of
autoreactive B cells and the formation and deposition of
antibody–antigen immune complexes (IC) consistent
with the diathesis, which involves multiple organ
systems. Evidences from familial aggregation studies,1–5
together with a high concordance among monozygotic
twins,6–8 suggest a genetic contribution. However, a
single gene with a clearly causal Mendelian effect has
not been identified, underscoring a multigenic mode
of inheritance. Among the quantitative trait loci identi￾fied from candidate gene-association studies of murine
lupus models and diverse human populations,
consistent linkage at chromosome 1q21.1–24, a region
that includes a functionally and structurally diverse
group of receptors that recognize the constant (Fc)
portion of specific immunoglobulin (Ig) isotypes, has
been shown9–15.
Consistent with a role for receptors for the Fc region of
IgG (FcgR), the pathogenesis of SLE involves the
production of autoantibodies, resulting in IC formation.
Altered or delayed clearance of these autoantibody￾containing ICs results in the deposition of these ICs in
various tissues, eliciting inflammation and damage by
engaging FcgRs and complement. Even from decades
ago it was well known that FcgR expression levels and
function were altered in SLE. The classic antibody
opsonized erythrocyte (EA) clearance studies16,17 showed
delayed in vivo FcgR-mediated clearance in patients with
SLE and ex vivo studies showed altered FcgR functions
such as phagocytosis.18 These alterations in FcgR func￾tion correlate with disease activity, suggesting that
disease activity may alter receptor function. However,
extensive studies of FcgRs in both animal models and
human population studies have since been per￾formed,19,20 and several functional genetic polymorph￾isms have been identified and associated with SLE in
several ethnic populations. Thus, FcgR function in
patients with SLE is influenced by both inherited genetic
variation and by acquired differences in function
attributable to disease activity.
Fc receptors are a heterogeneous group of hemato￾poietic cell surface glycoproteins that facilitate the
efficiency of antibody–antigen interactions with effector
cells of the immune system. These receptors regulate a
variety of humoral and cellular immune responses,
including phagocytosis, degranulation, antibody-depen￾dent cellular cytotoxicity, transcriptional regulation of
cytokine and chemokine expression, B-cell activation and
IC clearance. The cellular distribution and Ig isotype Received 26 March 2009; accepted 30 March 2009; published online

(IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM) specificity influence the
regulatory roles of Fc receptors. In addition, common
variation in the genes that encode Fc receptors, capable
of altering the efficiency of the mononuclear phagocyte
system to clear Ig ICs, provides a mechanism for the
heritable differences observed in the susceptibility to SLE
and subsequent IC-mediated tissue injury.21,22
The Fc receptor complex is noteworthy for its high
degree of sequence homology, pattern of linkage dis￾equilibrium and common copy number variation (CNV).
This group of structurally and functionally diverse
receptor genes are co-localized to a region on chromo￾some 1q21.1–24 that includes the classical Fc receptors
for IgG (Fcg) and non-classical Fc-like receptors (FCR1-
FCRL6L), Fc receptors for IgE (FceRI) and IgA/IgM
(Fca/mR). The consistency of genotype–phenotype find￾ings coupled with the topology of the Fcg receptor gene
cluster underscores the importance of this locus as
containing susceptibility alleles with potentially deleter￾ious functional consequences.
Human Fcc receptor structure and
function
FcgRs bind to the Fc portion of IgG and serve as a crucial
link between humoral and cell-mediated immune
responses. In addition, more recent data showed that
FcgRs also function as receptors for innate immune
opsonins (CRP and SAP) and provide a link between
innate and acquired immunity. In human, the classical
FcgR family is divided into three receptor families (FcgRI
(CD64), FcgRII (CD32) and FcgRIII (CD16)) based on
structural homology, difference in affinity and differ￾ences in specificity for IgG subclasses. These FcgRs are
also defined as either activating receptors (FcgRI,
FcgRIIA/C and FcgRIII) or as inhibitory receptor
(FcgRIIB) as they elicit or inhibit immune functions such
as phagocytosis, cytotoxicity, degranulation, antigen pre￾sentation and cytokine production through immune
tyrosine activating or inhibitory motifs (immunoreceptor
tyrosine activation motif (ITAM) or immunoreceptor
tyrosine inhibitory motif (ITIM)). These signaling motifs
are either on the same ligand-binding a-chain as for FcgRII
or on the associated homodimer accessory chains such as
the common Fc receptor g-chain (for FcgRI and FcgRIII,
Figure 1) that is also shared with FceRI and FcaRI.19 On
natural killer (NK) cells, FcgRIIIa associates with a
homodimer of the T-cell receptor z-chain. The ligand￾binding a-chain of most FcgRs consists of two or three
Ig-like domains in the extracellular region, a transmem￾brane domain and an intracellular cytoplasmic domain.
FcgRI
Located in chromosome 1q21, FcgRI is the only high￾affinity Fcg receptor that can strongly bind monomeric
IgG. This receptor is also unique from other FcgRs in
having three extracellular Ig-like domains (see Figure 1).
The FcgRI family has three genes (FCGRIA, FCGRIB and
FCGRIC) but only the FcgRIa product of FCGRIA has
been identified as a full-length cell surface receptor.23
FcgRI has been found on the surface of monocytes,
dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages and also activated
neutrophils.24 Stable expression of FcgRIa requires the
presence of the common FcR g-chain homodimer,
resulting in the expression of a complex of FcgRIa (the
a-chain)/g-g on the cell surface. FcgRIa can be expressed
in the absence of this g-chain homodimer, but its
expression is transient.
FcgRII
The FcgRII subclass of receptors on human chromosome
1q23 is composed of three genes (FCGR2A, FCGR2B and
FCGR2C) that encode the FcgRIIa, FcgRIIb and FcgRIIc
proteins. Expressed on monocytes, certain DCs, neutro￾phils, B cells, platelets and NK cells, FcgRII (CD32) is the
most widely distributed FcgR, with low binding affinity
for IgG.25 With two extracellular Ig-like domains, FcgRII
has a low binding affinity for monomeric IgG, but binds
IgG aggregates and ICs readily. As mentioned earlier,
unlike other FcgRs, the FcgRII proteins bear signaling
motifs directly in their intracellular cytoplasmic domains
and do not require the common FcR g-chain for stable
expression or function. Although the FcgRIIa and FcgRIIc
proteins contain the ITAM, the FcgRIIb protein is the
only inhibitory Fcg receptor containing an ITIM in its
cytoplasmic domain. An additional level of complexity
in the FCGR2B locus is that three alternatively spliced
transcripts can be expressed: b1 and b2 differ by an insert
of 19 amino acids in the FcgRIIb cytoplasmic domain,
whereas the b3 form lacks part of the signal sequence.
FcgRIIb1 is expressed on B cells as the only currently
recognized Fcg receptor on B cells, whereas FcgRIIb2 is
found on myeloid cells together with FcgRIIa. The
FCGR2C gene has a stop codon (STP)/glutamine (Q)
polymorphism at amino-acid position 13 in the first
extracellular domain and has been described as an
expressed protein on NK cells only when the 13Q allele
is present.26,27 The FCGR2C gene encodes an extracellular
domain that is highly homologous to FcgRIIB and an
intracellular cytoplasmic domain that is nearly identical
to the cytoplasmic domain of FCGR2A. Characterization
of the FCGR2C locus has suggested that the FCGR2C
gene is the result of an unequal crossover event between
FCGR2A and FCGR2B.

FcgRIII
Two genes, FCGR3A and FCGR3B, encode the two
receptors of the FcgRIII family (FcgRIIIa and FcgRIIIb).
FcgRIII is also considered as of low affinity; however,
FcgRIIIA can bind monomeric IgG with an intermediate
affinity and both FcgRIIIA and FcgRIIIB bind multimeric
IgG and IC efficiently. FcgRIIIa ligand binding is further
influenced by receptor glycosylation. Different glyco￾forms of FcgRIIIa are expressed on human NK cells and
monocytes/macrophages and these glycoforms have
different abilities to bind IgG ligand.
The FcgRIIIa protein is expressed as a transmembrane
protein on monocytes, tissue-specific macrophages, DCs,
d/gT cells and NK cells.19 On these cells, g-chain (or the
T-cell receptor z-chain on NK cells) is necessary for both
stable expression of the protein on the cell surface and
for signal transduction through the FcgRIIIa receptor
complex. Interestingly, in mast cells, the FcgRIIIa
receptor complex can also incorporate the b-chain from
the IgE receptor, resulting in an a/b/g-g complex on the
cell surface.
The FcgRIIIB gene is unique among the FcgR genes in
that it encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored
(GPI) receptor, FcgRIIIb. This receptor is expressed on the
surface of neutrophils and basophils.28 It is worth noting
that on the surface of neutrophils, FcgRIIIb is highly
expressed, with 150 000–200 000 receptors expressed per
cell. Biochemical studies have suggested that when
FcgRIIIb is expressed on the surface of neutrophils, it
interacts with the b2-integrin, CD11b/CD18. This is of
interest given the recent demonstration of the strong
genetic association between a variant in the CD11b/
ITGAM locus and SLE.
As mentioned above, each FcgR protein has differen￾tial ligand-binding preferences with respect to IgG
subclasses and differing affinities for IgG subclasses.
These preferences are summarized in Table 1 and have
been recently reviewed in great detail.29 It is worth
noting that the binding of IgG2 is generally limited to the
R131 allele of FcgRIIa, whereas the binding of IgG4 is
limited to the 159V allele of FcgRIIIa (see below).
FcgR function
Regulation of cell signaling. Upon cross-linking by IC,
activating FcgRs (FcgR associated with the common FcR
g-chain or the T-cell receptor z-chain or FcgRIIa/c)
initiate a signaling cascade through the ITAM, which
normally starts with sequential activation of protein
tyrosine kinases of the Src family followed by activation
of the Syk tyrosine kinase.30,31 This results in the tyrosine
phosphorylation of the ITAM itself, with recruitment of
various downstream targets, including other kinases,
adaptor molecules and other signaling intermediates (see
Bezman and Koretzky32 for a review). In many cell types,
activation of phosphoinositide-3 kinase results in the
recruitment of phospholipase Cg, which in turn induces
a phospholipase Cg-mediated calcium influx triggering
different effector functions.33,34 In antigen-presenting
cells, such as macrophages and DCs, activating FcgRs
mediate cell functions such as phagocytosis, respiratory
burst and cytokine production (tumor necrosis factor-a
and interleukin-6); in neutrophils and NK cells, they
trigger antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and
degranulation; and in mast cells, they induce degranula￾tion.35,36 It is a noteworthy finding that these so-called
activating receptors are not merely overlapping in
functional properties but in fact have specialized func￾tions that are due in part to the differences in the
cytoplasmic domains of the ligand-binding a-chains. For
example, a recent study has shown the unique ability of
FcgRIa to facilitate antigen presentation.37 Even more
surprising is our recent finding that FcgRIa is unique
among FcgR, and among other g-chain-associated Fc
receptors, in its ability to regulate the cell surface
expression of TNFSF13b (also called BLyS or BAFF)
upon cross-linking with either IgG ligand or with the
innate immune opsonin, CRP.38 Other differences in
receptor function are the result of differences in cell
surface expression. FcgRIIa is unique in its expression on
platelets, and cross-linking of FcgRIIa can directly
activate platelets resulting in platelet aggregation.
Although all of these functions are dependent on the
ITAM, it is likely that the sequences in the associated
a-chains are also contributing to net receptor function.
Indeed, we have shown that the cytoplasmic domain of
FcRIa, devoid of any known signaling motifs, modifies
g-chain-based signaling and other recent studies have
shown that these cytoplasmic domains can recruit
different molecules to the receptor complex. Future work
will be required to fully delineate the signaling elements
engaged by the ITAM-expressing FcgR, and this work
promises to provide additional insights into the func￾tions of each of these different FcgRs.
A key function of these activating FcgRs is the removal
or clearance of ICs. As noted above, this function is
known to be altered in patients with SLE. Of all FcgRs,
FcgRIIIa is thought to play an important role in IC
clearance. The intermediate affinity of this receptor on
macrophages (fixed tissue macrophages) makes it ideally
suited as a capture receptor to facilitate clearance. Of

course, this does not preclude a role for other FcgR in IC
handling, and it is likely that IC clearance represents the
integrated function of multiple FcgR working in concert
with complement receptors.
As the sole Fcg receptor bearing an ITIM, FcgRIIb acts
as a suppresser of IC-mediated cell activation and when
co-cross-linked with surface Ig FcgRIIb functions as a
suppressor of B-cell activation. When FcgRIIb is cross￾linked with other activating receptors, the ITIM is
phosphorylated by an Src family kinase such as Lyn,
which leads to the recruitment of Src homology 2
domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP-1),
SHP-2 and/or SH2-domain-containing inositol polypho￾sphate 50 phosphatase (SHIP). In B cells, SHIP can inhibit
activation pathways mediated by pleckstrin homology￾domain-containing kinases, such as phospholipase Cg
and Bruton’s tyrosine kinase, therefore suppressing
downstream events such as the Ig-induced calcium flux
and diminish multiple cellular functions induced by
ITAM-containing receptors as mentioned above.39 A key
role for FcgRIIb in regulating autoimmunity has been
shown in both murine models and in patients with SLE.
Certain mouse strains that are deficient in FcgRIIb
develop a spontaneous lupus-like disease, resulting in
glomerulonephritis and premature mortality.40 Conver￾sely, increases in FcgRIIb expression in these mice can
restore tolerance and ameliorate the spontaneous auto￾immune phenotype.41 In patients with SLE, alterations in
FcgRIIb expression have also been noted. However,
disease is associated with increased expression of the
FcgRIIb protein on the surface of B cells. Clearly,
additional work is needed to more fully understand the
critical role of this receptor in the regulation of immune
tolerance and autoimmunity.
More recent data from a number of different receptor
systems have challenged the conventional ITAM/ITIM
concept.42,43 Extensive cross-talk, or co-modulation,
between receptor systems has now been described and
is likely to be pervasive across many different receptor
systems. For example, the IgA Fc receptor, FcaRI, can not
only activate cells but also cross-inhibit other receptors,
including the classical FcgR. Similarly, engagement of
receptors containing ITIMs can result in the induction of
functional responses such as antigen presentation
through FcgRIIb on DCs. The regulation and determina￾tion of the activating and inhibitory potential of FcgR are
likely influenced through the complex interplay of the
degree of receptor cross-linking, the nature of interaction
between receptor subunits and the interactions with
other cell surface receptors (such as CD11b/CD18).
FccR polymorphisms and association
with SLE
Sequencing of the genes in the Fcg receptor cluster has
resulted in the identification of numerous genetic
variants, including functionally relevant variants. The
importance of FcgR variants as SLE susceptibility factors
and as factors influencing disease outcomes is high￾lighted by the consistent association of many of these
genetic variants with disease. Table 2 highlights some of
the consistent associations observed between FcgR
variants and SLE. However, limiting the ability to
examine the role of genetic variants in these genes is
the high degree of sequence homology between genes
(Figure 2). Indeed, this sequence homology precludes the
assessment of most single-nucleotide polymorphisms

(SNPs) in these genes on the currently available genome￾wide SNP arrays. In the first two published genome￾wide association studies (GWAS),44,45 the arrays con￾tained only 11 and 19 SNPs across the entire low-affinity
FcgR cluster, precluding a detailed analysis of association
between these genes and SLE. We will summarize the
current knowledge regarding associations between
genetic variants in each of the low-affinity classical FcgR
and SLE.
FCGR2A
A non-synonymous G-to-A variant in the FCGR2A gene
(rs1801274) results in a single amino-acid difference at
position 131 (R131 and H131) in the second extracellular
Ig-like domain of the FcgRIIa protein. This allelic
difference alters recognition of ligand. The FcgRIIA￾H131 (histidine residue at position 131) allele is able to
bind IgG2 effectively, whereas the R131 (arginine residue
at position 131) allele does not bind IgG2.21,46 This
affinity variation leads to functional difference: phago￾cytes from homozygous H131 individuals are much
more effective than those from homozygous R131 donors
in terms of phagocytosis of IgG2-opsonized particles.47
Several independent studies in multiple ethnic groups
have reported the association of R131 with the suscept￾ibility to SLE and/or lupus nephritis in Dutch Cauca￾sians, European-Americans, African-Americans and
Koreans,48–50 whereas other studies have presented
inconsistent results.51–55 Karassa et al.
56 did a meta￾analysis of 17 published studies and inferred that the
R131 allele had 1.3-fold higher risk for SLE susceptibility
compared with the H131 allele. Besides contributing to
susceptibility, the FcgRIIa-R131 allele was also shown to
be related to SLE severity.57 Haseley et al.
57 found that the
presence of 131R/R was associated with renal involve￾ment in patients with IgG2 anti-C1q autoantibody￾positive nephritis. Inconsistencies between studies might
be attributable to ethnic differences, disease heterogene￾ity (that is, subclass of autoantibodies) or to genotyping
error.
FCGR2B
A non-synonymous T/C SNP in the FCGR2B gene has
been identified that results in the change of an isoleucine
(I) to threonine (T) substitution at position 187 in the
transmembrane domain of the FcgRIIb protein.58,59 This
single amino-acid substitution has been shown to affect
the inhibitory function of FcgRIIb on B cells. The 187T
allele is excluded from lipid rafts and has a decreased
inhibitory potential toward BCR signaling.60,61 Likewise,
the 187T allele has been reported to be associated with
SLE in Asian populations, including Japanese, Chinese
and Thais,59,62,63 but no association has been found in
African-American or Caucasian in the United States or
Europe.58,64 A meta-analysis of association of this variant
in FCGR2B with SLE in three independent studies of
Asian populations showed an odds ratio of 2.45 for
187T/T vs 187I/I for SLE susceptibility.60
In 2004, Su et al.
65 identified a promoter haplotype that
alters FcgRIIb promoter activity. The less frequent
promoter haplotype (386C-120A) showed increased
promoter activity and drove higher receptor expression
in both transfected cell lines and on cells ex vivo from
genotyped donors than the more frequent haplotype
(386G-120T).65,66 The less frequent and more active
promoter haplotype was associated with SLE in a
Caucasian population with an odds ratio of 1.6.65
Confirmation of this association has been published
and has shown that the same 386G/C SNP associates
with SLE susceptibility.67 The analysis of these promoter
variants in FCGR2B is hampered by complete sequence
identity with the proximal promoter of FCGR2C.65
Studies examining these SNPs need to take care to
ensure gene specificity in any analysis of this genomic
region.
FCGR3A
As noted above, FcgRIIIa is thought to play a critical role
in IC clearance. In addition, this receptor is an important
mediator of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxi￾city functions on NK cells.68 A non-synonymous SNP
(rs396991) that encodes a T-to-G change at nt559 results
in a phenylalanine (F) to valine (V) amino-acid change at
position 159 in the second extracellular domain of the
FcgRIIIa protein. These alleles of FcgRIIIA have differing
binding affinities for IgG. The FcgRIIIA-158V allele (also
known as 176V/F when the leader sequence is included)
binds IgG1, IgG3 and IgG4 with higher affinity relative to
the 158F (176F) allele. In addition, the increased binding
capacity of the 158V allele results in more robust
downstream functional effects. Using peripheral blood
NK cells from genotyped donors, individuals homo￾zygous for the 159V allele show higher calcium transi￾ents, higher induction of CD25 expression and more
rapid apoptosis when compared with donors homozy￾gous for 159F.69,70 Consistent with a critical role for
FcgRIIIa in IC clearance, the lower IgG-binding allele,
158F, is associated with SLE susceptibility in several
case–control studies in multiple ethnic groups (Cauca￾sian and African-American).
A role for FcgRIIIa in disease severity has also been
shown. Within patients with renal disease, the higher
binding 159V allele is associated with development of
end-stage renal disease.71 This result, in conjunction with
the SLE susceptibility studies of FCGR3A, shows that
this gene can influence not only disease susceptibility but
also disease progression. In patients with renal disease,
progression to end-stage renal disease is associated with
the higher binding allele of FcgRIIIa, consistent with a
role for this receptor in promoting more vigorous local
inflammatory responses in the kidney.
FCGR3B
Three different allotypic variants of FcgRIIIb, NA1, NA2
and SH, have been identified through serological studies.
The sequence bases for these FCGR3B variants are now
known (Figure 3). The six SNP differences underlying
these three serologic allotypes include five non-synon￾ymous SNPs and one synonymous SNP. The five amino￾acid changes are all in the first extracellular domain of
FcgRIIIb (marked as black in Figure 3), with the amino￾acid 65 change resulting in a loss of a glycosylation site in
the NA2 allele.22,72 The enhanced functional capacity of
the NA1 allele is firmly established. Some studies have
suggested differing binding affinities for IgG1 and IgG3
between the FcgRIIIB-NA1 and FcgRIIIb-NA2 alleles,
with the NA1 allele showing higher binding. Alterna￾tively, the NA1 and NA2 alleles may interact differently
with other cell surface receptors, such as the b2-integrin,
CD11b/CD18. Interactions with other cell surface recep￾FccR and SLE

tors may be critical or essential to FcgRIIIb function. As
noted above, this receptor lacks a transmembrane and
cytoplasmic domain and is anchored to the cell surface
through a GPI linkage. In the absence of these domains,
such inter-molecular interactions may be necessary for
FcgRIIIb to function, and glycosylation change between
the NA1 and NA2 alleles may alter such interactions.
In a Japanese population, the NA2 allele has been
reported as a susceptibility factor for SLE.73 However,
this observation has not been replicated. More recently, a
re-examination of the importance of variation—CNV—at
the FCGR3B locus has suggested a role for decreased CN
of FCGR3B in SLE susceptibility (see below).
Genome-wide association studies
A number of GWAS studies in SLE have now been
reported. As noted above, SNP coverage in the low￾affinity Fcg receptor is poor, with some genes (FCGR2C
and FCGR3B) receiving no coverage. Nonetheless, a
statistically significant association at the non-synon￾ymous H131/R131 variant (rs1801274) was noted in the
recent GWAS performed by the International Consor￾tium on Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.45 The SNPs in
other FCGR genes previously associated with SLE were
not represented on any of the arrays used in the recent
GWAS studies. The presence of high sequence homology
between the FCGR genes, with the presence of a
segmental duplication in this region (Figure 2), precludes
any GWAS-based conclusions regarding association at
the FCGR3A or FGR2B loci with SLE. In addition,
association between SNP variants and SLE in this
genomic region may also be confounded by the presence
of known CNVs.

CNV of FCGR3B in SLE has been known since the 1990s,
although it was not reported as such.74 Although
FCGR3B is almost identical at the sequence level to
FCGR3A, unique alleles in the 30
-most exon have been
used to detect FCGR3B CNV. Deficiency (that is, a CN of
zero) of FCGR3B was first observed as a lack of all three
alleles in two healthy individuals in 1990.75,76 An
increased CN was later observed through the presence
of all three alleles in three individuals.77
Association of FCGR3B CNV with SLE has been
determined using a real-time PCR assay developed by
Aitman et al.
78 Relative CN of o2 at the FCGR3B locus
was associated with risk for SLE (with and without
nephritis). Relative CN of 42 FCGR3B was not
significantly associated with protection against SLE but
was significantly associated with protection against
Addison’s disease and Wegener’s granulomatosis in a
French population.79 The same assay has been used to
show an association of FCGR3B CN with risk for
glomerulonephritis and lupus nephritis: increased CN
was protective and decreased CN was a risk factor.78 There
is evidence that CNV of FCGR3B is associated with
alterations of surface expression on neutrophils, neutrophil
adhesion and IC uptake by neutrophils.80 Deficiencies in
these neutrophil functions could cause or contribute to the
characteristic buildup of ICs seen in SLE.
CNV of the other FCGR genes in the 1q23 cluster
CNV has been reported for other FCGR genes, but no
association with SLE has been reported yet. CNVs of
FCGR2C and FCGR3B have been reported to be linked.81
CNV of FCGR2C, assessed by multiplex ligation-depen￾dent probe amplification, was determined to be asso￾ciated with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.27 In
the same report, CNV of FCGR3A was also reported.
CNV of the two remaining receptors in the chromosome
1q23 FCGR cluster, FCGR2A and FCGR2B, has yet to be
reported. Although CNV of the other FCGR genes has yet
to be associated with SLE, if reported at all, the clear
significance of FCGR3B CNV in SLE, the evidence of
more extensive CNV in the cluster, and the logical
connection between FCGRs and the pathology of SLE
suggest that further study of CNV in the 1q23 FCGR
cluster is warranted.

Genes and Immunity

mental factors will expedite our understanding of SLE
pathogenesis and importantly, its natural history.
Heritable indices of SLE severity and progression
Recent advances in human genome sequencing and
marker density, together with estimating unknown phase
and accounting for population stratification in large
case–control association studies, have become key
elements for identifying heritable risk factors for lupus
susceptibility. However, longitudinal studies will be
essential to facilitate our understanding of the genetic
markers involved in influencing disease severity and
progression, which is characterized by flare, chronically
active disease and quiescence. Such characterization
would facilitate an evaluation of the effectiveness of a
prognostic index for SLE.
Fc receptor co-expression and function
Immune surveillance is redundant and is reflected by the
co-expression of multiple ITAM- or ITIM-containing Fc
receptors on the same cell. The co-expression of multiple
stimulatory ITAM-dependent Fc receptors provides a
mechanism by which the joint effect conceivably results
in a synergistic activation of effector cells and enhanced
efficiency for IC clearance. Alternatively, in cells that
co-express inhibitory ITIM- and ITAM-dependent Fc
receptors, the magnitude of the effector cell response
upon IgG isotype cross-linkage is attenuated, reflecting
an antagonistic joint effect. Thus, the SLE diathesis may
reflect the relative difference in the magnitude of ITAM￾and ITIM-dependent effects on the activation of effector
cells, which in turn may be influenced by the genetic
heterogeneity observed in the genes that encode the Fc
receptors. The delineation of individual stimulatory and
inhibitory effects of Fc receptor gene loci or haplotypes
may advance our understanding of the combined effects
of these receptors on the risk of, or time to, SLE and
related sequelae or clinical manifestations.
Gene-by-gene interactions
In addition to the Fcg receptors, strong and consistent
gene associations were shown across diverse populations
for human leukocyte antigens,70,72,82,83 components of the
classical complement activation system belonging to the
major histocompatibility complex class III region70,72,83,84
and more recently, the type I interferon regulatory
factor-5 (IRF5),69,85–87 the protein tyrosine phosphatase,
PTPN22,69,75,78,88–90 ITGAM, PXK and KIAA1542.45 De￾spite strong associations with SLE, these susceptibility
loci do not sufficiently contribute to the risk of this
complex phenotype alone. The joint effects of deleterious
variation in these susceptibility loci and Fc receptor
genes, which offer fundamental biologically plausible
mechanisms for pathological processes, may contribute
to our understanding of SLE pathogenesis and natural
history of SLE.
Gene-by-environment interactions
Tantamount to the exploitation of gene–gene inter￾actions are evaluations of microenvironment factors that
alter Fc receptor expression and function. Several
cytokines, chemotactic factors and growth factors have
been shown to alter Fcg receptor expression on diverse
cell types in an autocrine and paracrine manner. Fcg
receptor effector functions may also be altered by
reactive oxygen species and serine proteases, which
promote differences in receptor phagocytotic and bind￾ing capacity, respectively. It is conceivable that additional
microenvironmental factors, including infectious agents,
sex hormones, C-reactive protein and mannose-binding
lectin that correlates with the SLE diathesis, influence Fc
receptor function. Such modifying effects may under￾score the variation in Fcg receptor gene associations
observed with disease and lupus nephritis. This is
particularly noteworthy because the pleiotropic effects
of these inflammatory molecules act locally to perturb
Fcg receptor-mediated IC clearance, leading to chronic
inflammation of the glomeruli, fibrinoid necrosis and
reduced renal capacity, consistent with lupus nephritis.
Conclusion
The study of Fcg receptors in SLE has a rich heritage
dating back over 30 years to the initial Fcg receptor￾mediated clearance studies. Our knowledge of the
diversity of Fcg receptor structure and function has
developed substantially since that time. On the basis of
this increase in knowledge about these receptors, many
pivotal mechanistic and genetic studies have reinforced
the functional importance of these receptors in the
pathogenesis of SLE. As we develop additional tools to
assess genomic variants in this region, we will undoubt￾edly be surprised by the diversity of variation among
these genes and gain increased insight into the role of Fcg
receptors in SLE.
