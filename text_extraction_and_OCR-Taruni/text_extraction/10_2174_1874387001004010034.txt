Abstract: Shape Medical Systems, Inc. has developed a new miniaturized, simplified system for non-invasive 
cardiopulmonary gas exchange quantification and has targeted their system for submaximal clinical exercise testing in 
order to abbreviate testing in an expanding clinical market during a climate of escalating health care costs. The focus of 
the present study was to compare this new device to a validated, standardized system for measures of cardiopulmonary 
gas exchange. Eighteen healthy adults (10 male/8 female, age 29±7 yr, BMI 23.8±2.4 kg/m2
) were brought to the 
laboratory and instrumented with both measurement systems via in-series pneumotachs. Additionally, the Shape system 
included a pulse oximeter for heart rate (HR) and oxygen saturation (SaO2), while the standard system included separate 
12-lead ECG and oximetry devices. The protocol included 2-min resting breathing, followed by 3-min at each of 3 
workloads (50, 70, 125 watts) on a cycle ergometer. Data were collected breath-by-breath and averaged the last 30-sec of 
each workload. After a 15-min rest period, the pneumotach order was reversed and the study repeated. Since gas exchange 
data were similar (p>0.05) within a given metabolic testing system between sessions the data were pooled for comparing 
the Shape and Standard systems. There were no differences (p>0.05) between the systems for oxygen consumption-VO2, 
carbon dioxide production-VCO2, ventilation-VE, end tidal CO2-PetCO2, tidal volume-VT, respiratory rate-fb, and HR at 
rest or any work load. SaO2 was slightly, but significantly lower using the Shape embedded oximeter (p<0.05, averaging 
~1% across workloads). There were significant correlation coefficients (p<0.001) between the systems for VO2 (r=0.991), 
VCO2 (r=0.986), VE (r=0.995) and PetCO2 (r=0.953). Bland Altman plots indicated good agreement between systems for 
the same gas exchange measures, independent of workload. The Shape system was sensitive to small increases in work 
(50 to 70 watts) and there were no differences in gas exchange measures in a subgroup of subjects (n=4) using a tight 
fitting mask instead of a mouthpiece (p>0.05). These data suggest that the new, simplified metabolic system developed by 
Shape Medical Systems, Inc. accurately quantifies key cardiopulmonary variables over a range of workloads, has a 
coefficient of variation similar to a well validated system and can be used with mouthpiece or mask.

INTRODUCTION 
 Cardiopulmonary exercise testing is playing an 
expanding role in the management of a variety of clinical 
populations, including heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, 
obstructive and restrictive lung disease [1]. Traditionally, 
non invasive measures of gas exchange have focused on 
determination of peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak), 
however, it is becoming increasingly clear that many 
submaximally determined gas exchange parameters (e.g., 
ventilatory efficiency -VE/VCO2, end tidal CO2-PetCO2, 
oxygen efficiency slope) may be as important as peak 
variables for quantifying health status, determining 
prognosis, as well as following response to therapy [2-4]. 
There may also be advantages to clinical submaximal 
cardiopulmonary exercise testing including more 
reproducible measures, levels of activity that correspond to 
tasks of daily living, better patient compliance and reduced

potential for adverse events [5, 6]. The testing environment 
and length of the test would also be greatly simplified, thus 
reducing test costs. 
 There are a number of automated metabolic measurement 
systems currently available on the market, each with specific 
strengths and limitations [7-11]. Typically however they 
require an integration of equipment, multiple test personnel 
and significant technical knowledge to run the systems and 
capture consistent and reliable data. Technical expertise is 
needed to perform relatively sophisticated calibration 
routines and some basic understanding of the algorithms 
used for assessment along with a skilled team for carrying 
out the testing (typically a nurse, exercise specialist and/or a 
physician) are needed. The instruments have tended to be 
bulky and require separate space for performing the testing 
along with code carts and other complimentary equipment 
(ECG machines) needed when exercising patients to their 
maximal capacity. 
 In view of these limitations various studies have 
examined simpler and more portable metabolic systems. 
However, the validity of these newer systems, e.g. the Jaeger 

Clinical Exercise Testing The Open Sports Medicine Journal, 2010, Volume 4 35
Oxycon Mobile, remains controversial as systematic errors 
have been reported in gas exchange measurements [12]. 
 More recently, a metabolic testing system has been 
developed (Shape Medical Systems, Inc, St. Paul, MN) that 
is small, portable, self calibrating (minimizing user error), 
with built-in automated temperature, barometric pressure, 
and humidity corrections. The user interface is simplified 
and software is designed so that extensive understanding of 
the measurements or equipment is not needed. The system 
relies on algorithms that were designed for light submaximal 
testing to obtain much of the same information gleaned from 
a maximal stress test. It relies on a simple 3-5 min, light￾moderate intensity exercise test to determine health status 
and can be performed in a doctor’s office without need for 
complimentary monitoring equipment or sophisticated 
treadmills or cycle ergometers and can be used with a simple 
step test. The system however has not been validated with an 
established metabolic measurement system. Thus, the focus 
of this study was to compare gas exchange data obtained 
with this simplified system with a sophisticated, validated 
and calibrated state-of-the-art system currently used in our 
laboratory. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Participants 
 Healthy active males and females (between the ages of 
18 and 49 yr) were recruited from the surrounding area. 
Exclusion criteria included use of medications, history of 
cardiac or pulmonary abnormalities, obese (BMI >27), or 
orthopedic limitations. The study was reviewed and 
approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board and 
all subjects reviewed and signed informed consent prior to 
participation. 
Overview of the Protocol 
 Subjects reported to the laboratory and were 
simultaneously instrumented with the Shape simplified 
system and the “standard system”. For the Shape system they 
were instrumented with a pulse oximeter (for heart rate) and 
a pneumotach attached in series with the standard system. 
For the standard system, subjects were instrumented with a 
12-lead electrocardiogram (for heart rate and safety 
monitoring), a mouthpiece in series with pneumotachographs 
from both systems, along with a nose clip. Both systems 
were started simultaneously and data were collected in the 
following order, 2-min rest, 3-min 50 watts, 3-min 70 watts 
and 3-min 125 watts on a cycle ergometer. After a brief rest 
period (15 minutes) the order of the pneumotachs was 
reversed and the test repeated (see Fig. 1). The small 
increment from 50 to 70 watts provided a test for sensitivity 
of the systems to discriminate small changes in external 
work. Linking the pneumotachs in series allowed 
simultaneous data collection, however, this could have small 
influences on breath timing, phase relationships and dead 
space and thus the data were collected with the pneumotachs 
under both conditions for comparison. 
Standard System for Non invasive Gas Exchange Testing 
 The standard system included a Medical Graphics 
CPX/D.(Medical Graphics, St Paul, MN) integrated to a 
Perkin Elmer Mass Spectrometer MGA 1100 (MA Tech 
Services, Inc, St. Louis, MO) for gas analysis. This system 
using the Prevent Pneumotach has been previously validated 
using classical bag collection techniques and gravimetric 
quality gases for calibration of the mass spectrometer [13, 
14]. In addition, characteristics of the system were optimized 
by testing individuals at multiple breathing rates and exercise 
loads [13, 15]. Previously published data regarding this 
system resulted in a coefficient of variation for oxygen 
consumption-VO2 ranging from 8.7% at rest to 2.3% during 
heavy exercise [14]. An ECG was integrated with the 
Medical Graphics System to obtain heart rate on a breath by 
breath basis throughout testing. 
Fig. (1). Protocol for validating the Shape system for 
cardiopulmonary gas exchange measures. Subjects were 
instrumented with both systems by putting pneumotachs in series. 
Data were collected at rest, 50, 70 and 125 watts followed by a 15-
min rest period, reversing pneumotach order and repeating the 
testing. 
Shape System for Submaximal Cardiopulmonary 
Exercise Testing 
 The Shape-HF™ Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing 
System (St. Paul, MN) consisted of the following significant 
components, 1) Laptop Computer, 2) Shape-HF Data 
Analyzer, 3) Patient Interface, 4) Pulse Oximeter Finger 
Probe (Smiths Medical PM, Inc. 3711 BCI Digital Micro 
Power Board with w Comfort-Clip Oximetry Finger Sensor) 
(see Fig. 2). The laptop computer supplied with the Shape￾HF system is OEM supplied operated with Windows XP® 
operating software. Shape-HF system software is installed in 
the laptop computer.

 The Shape system is designed for use with a wide range 
of exercise testing modalities including simple stair stepping, 
cycle ergometry, treadmill, or other exercise modalities 
while the patient is connected to the Shape-HF Data 
Analyzer via the patient interface and pulse oximeter finger 
probe. The data analyzer contains discrete analyzers that 
measure expired oxygen and carbon dioxide, an airflow 
measurement subsystem that measures expired and inspired 
air using a fixed orifice, differential pressure pneumotach, 
and a pulse oximeter to measure heart rate and blood oxygen 
saturation. The data analyzer transmits measured data once 
per breath via a USB interface cable to the laptop computer. 
The system requires a laptop computer; however, future 
designs will allow standalone systems. Transmitted data 
includes breath count, PetCO2, VCO2, VO2, tidal volume-VT, 
breathing frequency-fb, heart rate-HR, barometric pressure, 
SaO2, dead space, peak expiratory flow, volume Inspired, 
resting energy, expiratory time, and inspiratory time. The 
patient interface consists of a fixed orifice, differential 
pressure pneumotach to which a respiratory gas sample line 
and upstream and downstream differential pressure sample 
lines are attached. 
Additional Testing 
 A subset of subjects (n= 4) were brought back to the 
laboratory on a subsequent day to repeat testing using the 
Shape tight fitting mask. This was to assure that the use of a 
mask did not alter gas exchange data quality. 
Data Collection and Analysis 
 Data were collected on a breath-by-breath basis using both 
systems with complete datasets for each subject downloaded 
into Excel. Data were then averaged over the last 30-sec for 
each condition for each subject. Initial comparisons between 
exercise sessions for a given system did not reveal significant 
differences (p>0.05) across measures and thus data from each 
session were averaged for further comparisons between the 
Shape and standard systems. Descriptive statistics (means, 
standard deviations and ranges) were computed with 
comparisons made between systems for VT, fb, VE, VO2, VCO2, 
HR, SaO2, and PetCO2 values using students t-tests (=0.05). In 
addition, Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated to 
determine linearity between systems and Bland-Altman plots 
were constructed to assess agreement between systems. Primary 
analyses for correlations and Bland-Altman plots focused on the 
measures of VO2, VCO2, VE and PetCO2 as these measures take 
into account the integration of the primary measures used in 
cardiopulmonary gas exchange. 
RESULTS 
 Subject characteristics are reported in Table 1. Subjects 
were young men and women with normal weight and blood 
pressure values. 
 The Shape system tracked closely with breath-by-breath 
changes measured by the standard system. Fig. (3) is an 
example of the breath-by-breath changes in VO2 in a subject 
transitioning from rest to the initial work loads (50 and 70 
watts). Slight differences in phase are noted in part due to the 
sequence of pneumotachs and the ability to start the systems 
at identical time periods.

system for VO2 at rest and during the initial work intensities. Slight 
differences are noted in phase due to the differences in pneumotach 
order and slight variations in systems when attempting to start 
testing at identical time periods. 
Reproducibility of Shape Values Relative to the Standard 
System (Session 1 vs 2) 
 The coefficient of variation (CV) between sessions 1 and 
2 for the Shape system ranged from 2.9 to 10.8% for VO2, 
4.0 to 8.7% for VCO2, 1.9 to 3.3% for VE, 2.6 to 9.3% for 
HR, 0.3 to 0.4% for SaO2 and 2.9 to 4.3% for PetCO2. 
Typically the CV’s were higher in resting data and reduced 
with exercise. The exception was HR, which was highest at 
125 watts. The CV’s for the standard system were similar to 
the Shape system during exercise, except for HR which 
ranged from 1.6 to 3.8%. However this might be expected 
when comparing a 12-lead ECG to pulse oximetry. The CV’s 
for VO2 and VCO2 at rest tended to be lower in the standard 
system at 4.1 and 5.4%, respectively. 
Sensitivity of Shape System for Detecting Small Changes 
in Cardiopulmonary Measures 
 In order to test the ability of the Shape system to 
accurately measure small changes in gas exchange variables, 
the protocol included a relatively small 20 watt increment in 
workload during the exercise session (50  70 watts). 
Significant increases of similar magnitude were measured by 
both systems for VO2 (0.24±0.08 vs 0.23±0.07 L/min, 
p<0.05), VCO2 (0.27±0.08 vs 0.28±0.07 L/min, p<0.05) and 
VE (5.8±2.4 vs 6.3±2.3 L/min, for Shape and standard 
systems, respectively, p<0.05).

Comparison of Shape Cardiopulmonary Measures to the 
Standard System 
 Gas exchange and HR data are provided in Table 2 for 
rest and each exercise stage. There were no significant 
differences between the mean data obtained from the Shape 
system vs the mean values obtained from the standard 
system for the primary gas analysis measures (p>0.05). 
 Bland-Altman plots indicated good agreement between 
the systems for VO2, VCO2, VE, and PetCO2. Plots are 
shown in Figs. (4, 5) for rest and all workloads. The Bland￾Altman plots for VO2 demonstrated a mean for rest and all 
work levels of 0.180 L/min with limits of agreement 
(mean±2SD) of -0.178 to 0.228 L/min. VCO2 demonstrated a 
mean of 0.043 L/min with limits of agreement of -0.178 to 
0.260 L/min. VE demonstrated a mean of 1.13 L/min with 
limits of agreement of -1.31 to 3.56 L/min. PetCO2
demonstrated a mean of -0.56 with limits of agreement of -
2.40 to1.52 mmHg. These findings coincide with excellent 
correlation coefficients between Shape and the standard 
metabolic measurement system (not shown) for VO2
(r=0.991, P<0.0001, Root Mean Square Error [RMSE] = 
0.076), VCO2 (r=0.986, P<0.001, RMSE = 0.089), VE
(r=0.995, PV0.001, RMSE=1.601) and PetCO2 (r=0.953, 
P<0.001, RMSE = 1.341). 
Shape Mask vs Mouthpiece 
 In a subgroup of subjects we compared a tight fitting 
mask to the mouthpiece using the Shape system only. 
Correlation coefficients ranged from 0.94 for PetCO2 to 0.98 
for VO2, VCO2 and VE (p<0.001) with no significant 
difference between values at rest or any of the work 
intensities (p>0.05). This suggests that the mask is a valid 
tool for use with the Shape system when measuring 
cardiopulmonary exercise variables. 
DISCUSSION 
Overview of Main Findings 
 There is a need for simplified measurement systems to 
assess cardiopulmonary gas exchange in the clinical setting. 
The purpose of this study was to test a new simplified, 
miniaturized device developed by Shape Medical Systems, 
Inc. which is specifically designed for ‘plug and play’ 
submaximal exercise testing. This system compared 
favorably to our previously validated “state-of-the-art” 
cardiopulmonary gas exchange system that integrates the 
Medical Graphics CPX/D metabolic cart with a Perkin Elmer 
mass spectrometer and a GE 12-lead electrocardiographic 
system. The Shape system tracked small changes in external 
work and no systematic differences were observed across the 
primary cardiopulmonary gas exchange variables used in 
clinical exercise testing. In addition, the Shape system had 
similar CV’s for repeat testing compared to the standard 
system during exercise. Moreover, the use of a tight fitting 
mask provided similar gas exchange measures when 
compared to those made using a mouthpiece. 
 The protocol used allowed for the system pneumotachs to 
be aligned in series which facilitated simultaneous 
quantification of dynamic breath-by-breath changes in gas 
exchange during exercise. In addition, to obviate any issues 
due to slight differences in dead space or phase relationships 
when one system was down stream from the other, we tested 
subjects twice after reversing the pneumotach order. We 
performed submaximal testing (average HR <140 bpm and 
RER <1.0 at 125 watts) and thus there was little metabolic 
carry over into the second session. In fact, cardiopulmonary 
measures did not significantly differ from session 1 to 2 
which allowed for the pooling of data for comparisons 
between systems. The strong, highly significant correlation 
coefficients are consistent with minimal differences between 
the two systems. 
Benefits of Submaximal Cardiopulmonary Exercise 
Testing 
 The use of non invasive cardiopulmonary gas exchange 
testing has expanded into a number of clinical areas and is 
now used frequently to characterize disease status, determine 
response to therapy and gain perspective on prognosis [1, 3, 
16-20]. Limitations to further expansion of this testing to 
other clinical areas include space requirements, adequately 
trained personnel, the complexity and time for testing as well 
as the significant costs. In contrast, the Shape system has 
simplified procedures by eliminating physical calibration 
routines, miniaturizing the device, simplifying the computer 
interface and focusing on submaximal low level exercise

testing, thus meeting a potential market need. The system 
operates by using a vacuum to pull in gas samples from a 
patient’s inhalation and exhalation which is then split and 
sent to an O2 and CO2 sensor and analyzed simultaneously. 
The O2 cell is a standard chemical cell, used in various 
products, while the CO2 cell is a calibrated and temperature 
compensated infrared sensor. Flow rates are determined 
using traditional differential pressure measurements through 
a fixed orifice plate. 
 A number of studies have examined submaximal 
measures of cardiopulmonary testing. Measures such as 
ventilatory efficiency slope, O2 efficiency slope, PetCO2 and 
HR recovery slope all appear to be good prognostic 
indicators; in many cases as good as peak values [21]. In

addition, many of these measures may be more reproducible 
than maximal values since they are not effort dependent [5, 
6, 22]. 
Validity of the Standard System for Comparison 
 The system used as the “gold” standard for which to 
compare the Shape system was the Medical Graphics CPX/D 
integrated with mass spectrometry. This system has been 
validated against classical bag collection techniques and 
further optimized using various breathing patterns [13]. In 
addition, this system is maintained using strict quality 
control standards including routine physiologic calibrations 
in addition to the specific calibration procedures conducted 
prior to each testing session. The integrated mass 
spectrometer has clearly been shown to be the most stable 
system for gas analysis; able to measure several gases 
simultaneously, quickly and without the complication of 
water vapor. This automated system was chosen as the 
standard to validate the Shape system in order to be able to 
track breath-by-breath changes and to optimize collection 
timing. In addition, there are other short comings to the bag 
collection method. Lucia and colleagues report, among other 
concerns [10], the cumbersome inability to make simult￾aneous real time sample collections as a primary limitation 
of the bag collection method. Additionally, others have 
suggested that the ideal experimental design when validating 
metabolic measurement systems would have simultaneous 
breath-by-breath data collection [11]. The CPX/D has been 
successfully used as a reference system during rest and 
varying intensities of exercise elsewhere [7, 9, 22, 23].

Collectively, the CPX/D metabolic measurement system is a 
valid and reliable metabolic measurement system. 
LIMITATIONS 
 The Shape system is dependent on pulse oximetry for 
heart rate and does not contain a 12-lead ECG for detecting 
silent ischemia or arrhythmias. As demonstrated, the CV for 
heat rate ranged from 3.8% at rest to 2.4% at 50 and 2.6% at 
70 watts, but increased to 9.3% at the 125 watt workload. 
Excessive hand movement or gripping the cycle ergometer 
may have played a role in the variability, though subjects 
were generally asked to keep a loose grip on the handle bars. 
The mean HR did not differ between systems and the CV 
was within generally acceptable ranges. Other oximetry 
probes (e.g., forehead) have the potential to reduce this 
variability [25]. 
 The Shape system is also limited by the orifice restrictor 
plate in the pneumotach and hence the amount of volume 
that can flow through it. The Pneumotach can theoretically 
handle flow rates up to 300 L/minute; however, we have not 
tested it beyond the values reported in this manuscript. The 
reason for this is that the device in general is designed for 
low level submaximal exercise testing which is the clinical 
impetus for the product to be used quickly and safely in a 
physician office. 
CONCLUSIONS 
 The system developed by Shape Medical System, Inc 
tracks changes in key cardiopulmonary gas exchange 
measures accurately up to modest levels of exertion and 
provides a novel, simplified system for office based clinical 
cardiopulmonary exercise testing.
