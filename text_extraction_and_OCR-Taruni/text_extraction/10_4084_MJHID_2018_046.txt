Introduction. The myelodysplastic syndromes
(MDS) are a group of clonal bone marrow (BM) 
stem cell disorders, characterized by ineffective 
hematopoiesis, peripheral cytopenias, and 
hematologic cellular dysfunction, as well as 
potential transformation to acute leukemia.1,2,3 The 
clinical course is variable and the main clinical 
manifestations are related to the cytopenias:
anemia with the related symptoms, leukopenia with 
an increased incidence of infections, and 
thrombocytopenia with a risk of bleeding. MDS is 
usually a disease of the elderly, with 74 as the 
median age of diagnosis, and overall survival (OS) 
ranging from 4.6 years in patients with lower-risk 
disease4 to less than two years for the patients with 
higher-risk disease.2,5

Abstract. The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of clonal bone marrow (BM) stem 
cell disorders, characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, peripheral cytopenias, and 
hematologic cellular dysfunction, as well as potential transformation to acute leukemia.
Thrombocytopenia is common in MDS and is associated with bleeding complications, 
occasionally life-threatening. Low platelet count (PLT), as well declining PLT also serves as a 
prognostic marker. Understanding thrombopoiesis led to the cloning of thrombopoietin, 
resulting in the development of platelet stimulating agents, thrombomimetics, romiplostim and 
eltrombopag.
Both agents have been shown to increase PLT, decrease the need for platelet transfusions and 
reduce the number of bleeding episodes, with a reasonable tolerance. They are already approved 
for immune thrombocytopenia and thrombocytopenia related to liver disease.
Romiplostim and eltrombopag have proven efficacy in lower- and higher-risk MDS with 
thrombocytopenia, as monotherapy, as well as a part of a combination, either with lenalidomide, 
and mainly combined with hypomethylating agents. However, safety concerns have been raised: 
while several trials have been completed with no evidence of disease progression, others have 
been early terminated due to an increased number of BM blasts and possible leukemic 
transformation in treated-patients. The jury is still out regarding this safety concern, although 
recent publications are more encouraging.

Thrombocytopenia, defined as platelet count 
(PLT) less than 100x109
/L, occurs in 40-65% of 
patients with MDS.6 It is more common in the 
elderly and in patients with higher–risk disease. 
Severe thrombocytopenia, PLT< 30x109
/L occurs 
in 7.1% of MDS patients.7 The Low PLT, as well 
as the PLT dysfunction,8 is associated with 
bleeding in 19% of MDS patients,9 and bleeding is 
the cause of death in 10%-20% of MDS 
patients.6,10
The differential diagnosis of MDS with isolated 
thrombocytopenia from immune 
thrombocytopenia (ITP) might be sometimes 
difficult. The involvement of other lineages, as 
well as the use of additional markers, might help 
in distinguishing between both disorders and 
establishing the diagnosis of MDS. The use of 
flowcytometry, and applying the Ogata score,11 as 
well as molecular analysis and detection of MDS 
typical signatures, might help.12
Low PLT is also considered an independent 
prognostic factor and has been introduced into the 
prognostic classification systems,4,12,13 since it is 
believed to reflect the BM function and reserve. 
Recently, Itzykson et al14 have shown that not only 
PLT at presentation but also the rapidly decreasing 
platelet count (kinetics) might indicate a poor 
prognosis.
In addition to BM failure as a cause of 
thrombocytopenia, one has to take into 
consideration that PLT may decline due to some of 
the treatments administered to these patients, such 
as lenalidomide15,16 and hypomethylating agents 
(HMA), azacitidine17 and decitabine.18
Until recently, PLT transfusions have been the 
only available treatment for clinically significant 
thrombocytopenia.2 More than 33% of patients 
require PLT transfusions at some point in their 
treatment.9 However, PLT transfusions might carry 
the risk of infection transmission (being a 
biological product), and might also be associated 
with a risk of alloimmunization, and a short effect. 
Thus, more effective therapy is needed.
Thrombopoiesis and Thrombomimetic Agents. 
It has been more than a hundred years since James 
Homer Wright proposed that BM megakaryocytes 
are responsible for PLT production.19 Production 
of PLT involves hematopoietic stem cells, 
megakaryocytes, their differentiation, BM 
microenvironment and hematopoietic cytokines. In 
1958 Kelemen et al. described the humoral
substance responsible for PLT production, 
thrombopoietin (TPO, THPO).20 In 1994, three 
research groups simultaneously cloned and 
identified thrombopoietin.
21 TPO is a hormone 
produced in several organs, including the liver, 
kidney, skeletal muscle, and mainly by the BM 
stroma. The hormone acts on megakaryocyte 
progenitors to enhance their proliferation and 
survival.22 TPO interacts with the surface receptor, 
c-mpl, a member of the hematopoietic growth 
factor receptor superfamily.23 TPO has also been 
reported to have an effect on other lineages as 
well, at least in murine systems.24,25
The TPO cloning opened new avenues for 
treatment of MDS-related and other types of 
thrombocytopenia. A successful treatment is 
characterized by increasing PLT, and/or reducing 
the need for PLT transfusions and/or minimizing 
significant bleeding episodes, with a reasonable 
tolerance. The first generation drug, the 
recombinant human TPO mimicked TPO function 
by activating thrombopoietin receptor (TPOR). 
Despite encouraging preliminary results,26 the 
development of these agents was stopped when 
they were found to be associated with stimulation 
of antibodies that cross-reacted with endogenous 
TPO, eventually leading to severe 
thrombocytopenia.27 The next step was the 
development of non-peptide TPO mimetics or 
peptide TPO mimetics, thrombopoietin receptor 
agonists (TPO-RA), that do not share epitopes 
with endogenous TPO, the second-generation TPO 
mimetics, romiplostim and eltrombopag.
The two agents have been successfully tested in 
several types of thrombocytopenia, and have been 
approved in Europe and the US, for the treatment 
of adults with thrombocytopenia related to aplastic 
anemia, chronic ITP and liver disease.28 Both 
agents have good short- and long-term safety 
profiles and reasonable tolerance.29,30 The 
common adverse effects are fatigue, diarrhea, and 
headache.28 Other potential adverse effects are a 
risk for thrombotic complications, cytogenetic 
abnormalities, BM fibrosis, rebound 
thrombocytopenia, hepatic abnormalities, 
cataracts, and development of cross-reactive 
antibodies.
Romiplostim (Nplate®, Amgen) is a homodimer 
of a single-chain peptide consisting of the human 
IgG1-Fc region linked to a TPOR binding 
domain.31 Romiplostim binds the extracellular

www.mjhid.org Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis 2018; 10; e2018046 Pag. 3 / 7
domain of the TPOR and competes with TPO for 
this binding site. It is administered as a weekly 
subcutaneous (SC) injection. Single intravenous or 
SC injection in healthy people showed a dose￾responsive PLT production with an apparently 
linear relationship between PLT response and dose 
and a peak PLT on days 12 to 16.
In the first phase I/II clinical trial (Table 1), 44 
patients with lower-risk MDS and 
thrombocytopenia, (PLT<50x109
/L), romiplostim 
monotherapy increased PLT in four dosing 
regimens (300, 700, 1000, and 1500 µg).32 Finally, 
700 µg was suggested to be the optimal dose. A 
durable PLT response (eight consecutive weeks 
independent of PLT transfusions) was achieved in 
19 of 41 patients (46%). Those who achieved PLT 
response required fewer transfusions. However, 
two patients had an increase in BM blast count and 
progressed to AML, and other four patients 
experienced a transient increase in BM blast 
percentage. The results of this study, although 
encouraging, raised concerns about a possible 
association with leukemic progression.32
This was followed by a phase II study, in which
250 patients with low- or intermediate-1- risk 
MDS were randomized to receive romiplostim or 
placebo.33 The number of clinically significant
bleeding events (CSBE) was smaller in the 
romiplostim group. CSBE per patients had a hazard 
ratio for romiplostim: placebo of 0.83. PLT response 
rates were also higher in the romiplostim group 
(36.5%) versus the placebo group (3.6%). 
Unfortunately, the trial was early terminated due to 
concerns about increased rates of AML in the 
romiplostim group (6% vs 4.6%). Survival rates 
were similar among the two groups. Recently, 
Kantarjian et al.,34 have updated the study results, 
reporting a 5-year long-term prognosis of the 
patients who continued the follow-up. According to 
this report, both previously romiplostim-treated and 
placebo-treated patients had a similar leukemic 
transformation rate (12 vs 11%, HR 1.06) and 
mortality (56% vs 54%, HR 1.03).34,35 However, as 
we noted in our commentary,36 caution is still 
required in interpreting these data, since the patients 
in the romiplostim group had not been receiving 
romiplostim since 2011, and thus the report 
summarizes long-term prognosis of patients treated 
for a relatively short period. We still lack the safety 
data on monotherapy romiplostim administration for 
a long time.
Another study was designed to determine optimum 
scheduling of romiplostim in 28 low-risk MDS 
patients.
Patients were randomized to receive 750µg,

weekly SC, biweekly SC, or biweekly IV. Of the 
patients who completed 8 weeks of treatment, PLT 
response and reduced PLT transfusions were 
achieved in 65% and 61% of the patients, 
respectively.37 Duration of response was twice as 
long in the weekly vs biweekly administration. 
Two patients did have an increase in blast 
percentage. No neutralizing antibodies were 
found. The authors recommended 750µg per week 
SC as the standard dose.
A meta-analysis summarizing data from five 
TPO-RA trials with 384 patients, reported a 
relative risk (RR) of 0.84 for bleeding and 0.69 for 
PLT transfusion rate with romiplostim compared 
with placebo.38 The risk of AML progression was 
not increased. In an attempt to develop a 
predictive model for the response to romiplostim, 
based on a cohort of 250 patients, factors such as 
low levels of TPO, and less than 6 PLT 
transfusions were found to predict better response 
to the drug.39
Given the high incidence of decreasing PLT in 
MDS patients treated with HMA and/or 
lenalidomide, TPO-RA were investigated in these 
patients. In a small study (n=40), SC weekly 
romiplostim, 500µg, 750µg, or placebo was 
administered to azacitidine (AZA)-treated MDS 
patients. The clinically significant 
thrombocytopenic events (CSTE) in the placebo, 
romiplostim 750 and romiplostim 500 groups
occurred in 85%, 71% and 62% of the patients 
respectively, but the results were not statistically 
significant.40 No neutralizing antibodies were 
detected. Two patients in the romiplostim arm and 
one in the placebo arm progressed to AML.
In a study with 29 low- or intermediate-1 risk 
MDS patients receiving decitabine, patients were 
randomized to receive romiplostim or placebo. 
Bleeding events occurred in 43% of placebo and 
27% of romiplostim treated patients. PLT response 
was higher in the romiplostim group as well (33% 
vs 21%). Disease progression did not seem to be 
associated with romiplostim in this study since a 
similar percentage in each group progressed to 
AML.41
A phase II study with 54 lenalidomide - treated 
MDS patients, assessed whether concurrent 
romiplostim could alleviate the drug-related 
thrombocytopenia.42 Clinically significant 
thrombocytopenic events (CSTE) were reported in 
67% in the placebo group and 29% in the
romiplostim group. Romiplostim-treated patients 
also required fewer PLT transfusions. Two patients 
were found to have an increase in BM blasts >20% 
during the treatment.
Eltrombopag (Revolade ®, Novartis), is an oral, 
small-molecule, nonpeptide TPO-RA.43 
Eltrombopag does not have structural or sequence 
homology to endogenous TPO, which eliminates 
the risk of cross-reactive antibody development. 
Furthermore, unlike endogenous TPO, 
eltrombopag binds the transmembrane domain of 
TPOR, thus, does not compete with TPO for 
receptor binding. As a result, eltrombopag may 
enhance endogenous TPO function rather than 
substitute it. In addition to the effect on 
megakaryocyte proliferation and differentiation, 
eltrombopag was found to have in vitro anti￾leukemic effect, via intracellular iron 
depletion.44,45
Oliva et al.,46 reported their experience with 
eltrombopag monotherapy in patients with low￾and intermediate-1-risk MDS and severe 
thrombocytopenia (PLT<30x109
/L) with 
refractory or relapsed disease. Ninety patients 
were enrolled and randomized to eltrombopag vs 
placebo in this prospective phase 2 trial. 
Eltrombopag was safe and induced PLT response 
in 47% vs 3% (eltrombopag vs placebo). The 
assessment of long-term safety and efficacy of 
eltrombopag and its effect on OS (phase 2 part of 
the study) is still ongoing.
In another multicenter, randomized, placebo￾controlled, double-blind, phase 1/2 trial, 
eltrombopag monotherapy or placebo was 
administered to 98 patients with advanced 
myelodysplastic syndromes or AML.47
Eltrombopag increased rates of PLT and red 
blood cell transfusion independence compared 
with placebo (38% vs 21% and 20% vs 6%, 
respectively) and was well tolerated, with no new 
safety concerns.
We recently published the encouraging results 
of the part 1 and 2 of the ASPIRE trial.48,49 In this 
phase II, placebo-controlled trial, 145 patients with 
higher-risk MDS and AML were randomized 2:1 
to receive eltrombopag monotherapy or placebo. 
In part 1 of the study, 4 out of 17 treated patients 
experienced increased PLT and ten patients 
benefited from reduced PLT transfusion needs. In 
part 2, the primary endpoint, the number of 
clinically relevant thrombocytopenic events

www.mjhid.org Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis 2018; 10; e2018046 Pag. 5 / 7
(CRTEs) was observed in 54% of eltrombopag 
treated patients compared with 69% in the placebo 
group. No safety concerns were raised in this trial, 
and OS was not significantly different between the 
two groups.
Eltrombopag as a part of an anti-MDS 
combination therapy has been investigated as well. 
In a small pilot study, 9 of 12 AZA-treated 
patients maintained or improved their PLT.50 Up 
to 200 mg qd was tolerated in this study. 
Importantly, no increase in blast count or other 
serious adverse effects could be implicated to 
eltrombopag.
Finally, the preliminary results of the 
interesting SUPPORT study were presented.51 In 
this phase 3 trial, 356 patients with Int-1, Int-2 and 
high-risk MDS and thrombocytopenia 
(PLT<75x109
/L) were all treated with AZA and 
randomized 1:1 to eltrombopag or placebo. The 
study was early terminated due to futility. 
Eltrombopag given concomitantly with AZA was 
inferior to placebo/AZA-treated. Surprisingly, 
eltrombopag/AZA-treated increased the number of 
required PLT transfusions. Actually, 16% 
eltrombopag and 31% placebo patients were 
platelet transfusion- independent during the first 
four cycles of AZA. The eltrombopag/AZA group 
also had higher rates of febrile neutropenia. 
Although there was no difference in overall deaths 
rates between the two groups, the number of 
patients transforming to acute leukemia was higher 
in the eltrombopag/AZA group: 12% versus 6% in
the placebo/AZA group. A complete assessment of 
disease progression, including AML progression at 
the time of study termination, is still in progress. We 
suggested that there might be some interaction 
between AZA and eltrombopag that could account 
for the worsening clinical outcomes.
Summary and Conclusions. Thrombocytopenia 
is common in MDS and still presents a challenge. 
Understanding of thrombopoiesis biology enabled 
the cloning of thrombopoietin, which led to the 
development of pharmacological agents, 
romiplostim and eltrombopag. Both agents are still 
investigated in several clinical setups, including 
MDS-related thrombocytopenia. In MDS, these 
two agents have been shown to increase the 
platelet count, decrease the need for platelet 
transfusions and reduce the number of clinically 
significant bleeding episodes, with a reasonable 
tolerance. However, the response rate, as well as 
its duration, is still modest, and concerns have 
been raised regarding potential disease progression 
and leukemic transformation. Recent data are 
encouraging and predict a solution for the safety 
concerns, but further research is still needed on the 
way to solve this serious problem of MDS-related 
thrombocytopenia completely. A recent meta￾analysis further supports these conclusions, stating 
that no comparison between both agents have been 
performed, and further research is mandatory to 
answer the open question.52
