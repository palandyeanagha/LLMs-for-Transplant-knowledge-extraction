SUMMARY: A 14-year-old girl with acute lymphocytic leukemia complained of right flank pain and
fever. As her fever was prolonged, she underwent renal biopsy and was diagnosed with mucormycosis.
We performed right nephrectomy, and subsequent pathological examination of her tissue specimen also
detected mucormycosis. Here, we report a rare case of renal mucormycotic abscess.
Mucormycosis is an invasive fungal infection target￾ing compromised hosts and leading to hematological
malignancy. Mucormycosis is the common name given
to diseases caused by fungi belonging to the order
Mucorales (1). Mucormycosis displays a high mortality
rate without treatment. The genitourinary infections
caused by Mucor spp. are rare (2–5).
Here, we describe in detail the histological, immuno￾histochemical, and microbiological detection of mucor￾mycosis in a patient with acute lymphocytic leukemia
(ALL).
A 14-year-old girl with a history of ALL was admitted
to our pediatric department because of right flank pain
combined with fever and chills. She underwent intensive
chemotherapy for ALL and was scheduled to undergo
an additional chemotherapy regimen. She experienced
agranulocytosis for four times, for a total of 77 days,
induced by nine courses of chemotherapy; however, it
was treated by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor
(G-CSF), and her condition promptly improved.
Although her ALL was in remission and she displayed a
reduced peripheral blast count, she suffered right flank
pain on day 177 of her illness. The patient was a junior
high school student and was otherwise healthy before
admission for ALL. She had not suffered any trauma or
bruising.
On admission, her temperature was 39.79C, blood
pressure was 96/58 mmHg, pulse rate was 118
beats/min, and respiration rate was 24 breaths/min.
She had no apparent skin eruptions or urinary symp￾toms but displayed right costophrenic angle knock
tenderness. Laboratory tests revealed a leukocyte count
of 3,600 cells/l, hemoglobin level of 6.8 g/dl, and plate￾let count of 51,000 cells/l. In addition, her blood urea
nitrogen level was 4.0 mg/dl and creatinine concentra￾tion was 0.57 mg/dl. Urinary analysis showed an occult
blood score of 3＋ without bacteria, and serological
analysis detected a C-reactive protein level of 28.81
mg/dl and beta-D glucan concentration of º3.5 pg/ml.
Two sets of blood cultures were negative for infection.
Contrast enhanced abdominal computed tomography
(CT) detected a suspected right renal abscess; however,
there was no apparent abnormality in chest X-ray,
thoracic CT, and brain magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI). Initially, she underwent bactericidal anti￾microbial therapy; however, her condition did not im￾prove and fever continued. Because we had to rule out
differential diagnoses, e.g., a non-bacterial infection
such as candidiasis or a non-infectious condition such as
a tumor or infarction, we consulted the urology depart￾ment of our hospital to obtain renal biopsy. Thus, the
patient underwent biopsy of her right kidney on day 199
of her illness. The renal tissue specimen was obtained by
needle biopsy, and histopathological examination de￾tected severe inflammatory cell infiltration and abscess
formation. In addition, irregularly branched, thick, and
aseptate hyphae were detected. Periodic acid-Schiff
(PAS) staining and Grocott's staining depicted these
hyphae more clearly, which was consistent with mucor￾mycosis. Renal tissue culture was also performed, and
Mucor sp. was detected in the fungal agar tissue culture.
In order to allow the patient to continue and complete
her chemotherapy for ALL, we performed right
nephrectomy to remove the renal abscess. Grossly, the
removed right kidney weighed 400 g, measured 8 cm
along its longest axis, and displayed a large necrotic
abscess with hemorrhage in the renal capsule (Fig. 1a).
Histopathological examination revealed neutrophilic,
lymphocytic, and giant cell infiltration with necrosis
(Fig. 1b, ×400). The presence of fungi was also con￾firmed. Broad, pleomorphic hyphae that predominantly
branch at right angles besides non-septae, which are
characteristic features of mucormycosis, were observed
(Fig. 2a, ×400; Grocott's staining). In addition, severe
inflammation and multinucleated giant cell granuloma

were observed. Although any organisms could not be
detected in the kidney tissue culture, we diagnosed this
patient with a renal abscess involving mucormycosis.
Finally, in the kidney tissues, we immunohistochemi￾cally detected Rhizomucor (Fig. 2b). In brief, the kid￾ney tissue samples were stained, fixed in 10z formalin,
and embedded in paraffin. In 4-mm thick tissue sections,
immunohistochemical studies were performed using
anti-Rhizomucor antibody (1:500 dilution, monoclonal
mouse, clone: WSSA-RA-1; DAKO, Glostrup, Den￾mark). Next, the samples were rinsed with citrate buffer
solution (10 mM, pH 6.0), heated for 10 min, and
hybridized. Finally, using the amino acid polymer
method (simple stain), visualization was performed
using 3,3?-diaminobenzidine, and counterstaining was
performed with hematoxylin. Based on our immuno￾histochemical results, we diagnosed the causative agent
as belonging to the order Mucorales.
The entry sites of the organism were unclear, and
there was no apparent abnormality of thoracic organs.
Following nephrectomy, her postoperative course was
good and ALL went into complete remission; therefore,
she was discharged on postoperative day 383.
This is a rare case of renal infection involving mucor￾mycosis. Most patients with invasive mucormycosis are
compromised hosts that display an acute and progres￾sive course. Accordingly, this infection displays a high
mortality rate. Mucor spp. often invade blood vessels.
Rhinocerebral mucormycosis is the most common form
of mucormycosis; however, other sites such as the
lungs, intestinal tract, and skin can also be affected,
although kidney involvement is rare (3–6). The risk fac￾tors for mucormycosis are hematological malignancies
such as leukemia or malignant lymphoma, multiple
trauma, diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, severe burns,
immunosuppressive therapy, cancer chemotherapy,
steroid therapy, receiving an iron chelate preparation,
or undergoing bone marrow or organ transplantation.
Because it is difficult to detect species belonging to the
Zygomycota phylum using antigenic and molecular de￾tection methods, the diagnosis of mucormycosis de￾pends on the identification of morphological and patho￾logical features of the causing fungus (1). Levy and Bia
reported that the differential diagnoses of renal mucor￾mycosis include renal tumors, infarction, and abscesses
(5).
Genitourinary infections of mucormycosis are rare,
and previous cases were traced to a renal cortical abscess
or positive urine culture derived from the infection of an
occult site, and others (2–5). Our case involved a renal
abscess that was confirmed as mucormycosis by im￾munohistochemical and microbiological examinations.
On pathological examination, fungal infection was
confused with tuberculosis or other infections because
they share similar characteristics such as tissue necrosis,
neutrophil and macrophage infiltration, Langerhans
giant cell accumulation, and granuloma formation,
which are induced by the host immune response. Mucor
spp. often invade vessel walls and cause vascular necro￾sis or thrombosis as well as necrosis or bleeding within
the surrounding tissues. Their hyphae have also been
found within glomeruli, tubules, and the interstitium
(5).
The entry sites of these organisms remain unclear;
however, they live in natural and environmental
habitats, and susceptible hosts are always at a risk of ex￾posure. The major mode of disease transmission for
Zygomycetes is presumed to be the respiratory tract by
inhalation of spores from environmental sources, and
while that for others is the percutaneous or gastrointes￾tinal route. The traumatic implantation of spores has
been observed in a number of patients. Exposure can
also occur at medical injection sites, catheter insertion
sites, injection sites for illicit drug use, and the sites of
other traumas such as wounds or insect bites or stings
(7).
Our patient was diagnosed with mucormycosis based
on renal biopsy, and we confirmed the diagnosis using
tissue cultures and by pathological examination in
addition to immunohistochemistry. Thus, life-saving
nephrectomy was promptly performed. Mucormycosis
is an invasive fungal infection with a poor prognosis.
Renal biopsy is contraindicated for detecting renal
infection, including renal abscesses. However, in the
present case, we had to differentiate between a renal
abscess, renal infarction, and invasion of the right

347
kidney by ALL cells. Pathological examinations are
useful to arrive at a definitive diagnosis; therefore, we
recommend more aggressive surgical treatment
(removal or resection) in complex cases.
