Abstract
Background: Increased production of nitric oxide (NO) by the
lower respiratory tract is viewed as a marker of airway
inflammation in asthma and bronchiectasis. NO is a potentially
important immune modulator, inhibiting the release of several key
pro-inflammatory cytokines. As sarcoidosis is characterised by
granulomatous airway inflammation, we hypothesised that exhaled
NO levels might be raised in sarcoidosis and correlate with the
morphological extent and functional severity of disease.
Methods: Fifty two patients with sarcoidosis (29 men) of mean age
42 years underwent thin section computed tomography (CT),
pulmonary function tests, and measurement of exhaled NO.
Results: Exhaled NO levels (median 6.8 ppb, range 2.4–21.8) did
not differ significantly from values in 44 control subjects, and were
not related to the extent of individual CT abnormalities or the level
of pulmonary function impairment.
Conclusion: Exhaled NO levels are not increased in pulmonary
sarcoidosis.
