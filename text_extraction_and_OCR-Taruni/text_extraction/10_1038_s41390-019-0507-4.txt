Vaccine-preventable infections (VPIs) are a common and serious complication following transplantation. One in six pediatric solid
organ transplant recipients is hospitalized with a VPI in the first 5 years following transplant and these hospitalizations result in
significant morbidity, mortality, graft injury, and cost. Immunizations are a minimally invasive, cost-effective approach to reducing
the incidence of VPIs. Despite published recommendations for transplant candidates to receive all age-appropriate immunizations,
under-immunization remains a significant problem, with the majority of transplant recipients not up-to-date on age-appropriate
immunizations at the time of transplant. This is extremely concerning as the rate for non-medical vaccine exemptions in the United
States (US) is increasing, decreasing the reliability of herd immunity to protect patients undergoing transplant from VPIs. There is an
urgent need to better understand barriers to vaccinating this population of high-risk children and to develop effective interventions
to overcome these barriers and improve immunization rates. Strengthened national policies requiring complete age-appropriate
immunization for non-emergent transplant candidates, along with improved multi-disciplinary immunization practices and tools to
facilitate and ensure complete immunization delivery to this high-risk population, are needed to ensure that we do everything
possible to prevent infectious complications in pediatric transplant recipients.

INTRODUCTION
Pediatric solid organ transplantation has transformed the survival
rate and quality of life for patients with organ dysfunction and
failure. In the past 30 years, >53,000 children have benefited from
solid organ transplantation.1 Advancements in organ procurement
procedures, surgical techniques, anesthetics, postoperative man￾agement, and refined immunosuppression protocols have drasti￾cally improved short-term survival; >90% of pediatric solid
organ transplant recipients are alive 1-year posttransplant. There
is now an increasing shift in focus on reducing morbidity from life￾long immunosuppressive medications and optimizing long-term
survival.
Infectious complications remain a major source of morbidity
and mortality for all transplant recipients regardless of organ graft
type.2–4 Pediatric transplant recipients are at heightened risk for
infections compared to adult recipients, including vaccine￾preventable infections (VPIs), as children may lack previous
immunity from natural exposure and may not have had time to
finish their primary immunization series by the time of trans￾plant.5–7 This article provides an overview on the incidence and
impact of VPIs in the pediatric solid organ transplant population
and proposes policies and tools to improve immunization rates,
decrease VPIs, and improve long-term outcomes in this high-risk
pediatric population.
INCIDENCE OF VPIS IN PEDIATRIC SOLID ORGAN TRANSPLANT
RECIPIENTS
VPIs (including influenza, pneumococcus, meningococcus, Haemo￾philus influenzae type B, human papillomavirus, varicella, pertussis,
rotavirus, measles, mumps, Hepatitis A, and Hepatitis B) are a
common occurrence after pediatric solid organ transplantation.8–17
In a recent study of nearly 7000 pediatric solid organ transplant
recipients from 45 tertiary care centers across the United States,
1092 (15.6%) were hospitalized with a VPI in the first 5 years
posttransplant.18 The most common VPIs were influenza (40% of
cases), rotavirus (19% of cases), varicella (11% of cases), pneumo￾coccus (10% of cases), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (10% of
cases). The rates of hospitalization for these infections in the first
year posttransplant were much greater than the expected annual
rates of hospitalization in the general pediatric population (influenza
3.0% of the transplant population vs 0.06% of the general pediatric
population, rotavirus 2.6% of the transplant population vs 0.03% of
the general pediatric population, pneumococcus 1% of the
transplant population vs 0.5% of the general pediatric population,
and RSV 1.8% of the transplant population vs 0.3% of the general
pediatric population). These statistics do not include those
transplant recipients who had a VPI that was managed in the
outpatient setting, which presumably would also occur at higher
rates in pediatric transplant recipients compared to healthy children.

MORBIDITY, MORTALITY, AND COSTS FROM VPIS IN
PEDIATRIC SOLID ORGAN TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS
VPIs result in significant morbidity, morbidity, graft injury and
hospitalization costs after transplant.8–17,19 In Feldman et al.’s
study of >7000 children who received a solid organ transplant
between 2004–2011, the overall case fatality rate for VPIs was
1.7%.18 The case fatality rate for each individual VPI was
significantly higher in the transplant population than in the
general pediatric population. Pediatric transplant patients com￾pared to the generic pediatric population had 53 times greater
mortality rate from RSV, 17 times greater mortality rate from
pneumococcus, 23 times greater mortality rate from rotavirus, and
4 times greater mortality rate from influenza. Excluding infections
that occurred during the initial transplant hospitalization during
which every child would be intubated for the transplant surgery
and then return to the intensive care unit (ICU) postoperatively,
8% of children with a VPI required mechanical ventilation and 17%
required ICU-level care. Transplant hospitalizations complicated by
a VPI were on average $120,000 more expensive and 39 days
longer than transplant hospitalizations not complicated by a VPI.
VPIs can also result in vaccine-preventable cancers, which have
associated morbidity, mortality, and costs. In a cohort study of
>187,000 transplant recipients, 890 human papillomavirus-related
cancers were observed.11 Compared to the general population,
transplant recipients had a 3–20-fold increased risk for vaginal,
anal, vulvar, and penile in situ cancers and a 2–7-fold increased
risk for invasive cancers.
INCREASING RATES OF VACCINE HESITANCY, NON-MEDICAL
VACCINE EXEMPTIONS, AND VPIS ACROSS THE UNITED
STATES
Immunization is one of the most cost-effective ways of avoiding
disease. It has been estimated that vaccination prevents
approximately 42,000 early deaths and 20 million cases of disease,
with net savings of $13.5 billion in direct costs and $68.8 billion in
total societal costs, respectively.20 Despite the proven benefits of
vaccination,21–25 vaccine hesitancy (the reluctance or refusal to
vaccinate despite the availability of vaccines) continues to
threaten progress made in tackling VPIs. According to data from
the 2017 National Immunization Survey, the percentage of
children <24 months of age who had received no vaccines at all
had risen to 1.3%, up from 0.3% in the 2001 survey.26 A study
recently published by Olive et al. found an increase since 2009 in
“philosophical-belief” non-medical vaccine exemptions in 12 of
the 18 states that allow “philosophical-belief” exemptions and
describe hot spots of significantly lower vaccine rates in certain
large urban and also rural areas.27 Likewise, for the third year in a
row the Center for Diseases Control and Prevention observed a
rising rate of exemptions from school vaccination among children
entering kindergarten.28 The number of children who receive
some vaccines but refuse or delay others is much higher than
these statistics indicate.
Importantly, because under-immunization and vaccine refusal
tend to cluster geographically,27,29,30 vaccination rates in some
areas may fall well below levels needed to maintain “herd
immunity” for individual diseases, resulting in outbreaks.21,29,31
“Herd immunity” describes a concept where immunization of a
significant portion of the population provides some degree of
protection for those members of society who have not or cannot
develop immunity (for example, people with allergies to vaccines,
children who are too young to receive vaccines, or immunocom￾promised people who either cannot receive certain vaccines (such
as live vaccines) or who cannot mount an immune response to
vaccines). Vaccine refusal has been associated with outbreaks of
multiple infections that are potentially vaccine-preventable includ￾ing Haemophilus influenzae type b,32 varicella,25 pneumococcus,24
pertussis,33,34 and measles.34,35 World Health Organization data
shows a rise in the number of cases of measles in almost every
region of the world, with 30% more cases in 2017 than in 2016. In
2018, there were >370 confirmed measles cases in the US, which is
the second largest number since measles was eliminated in the US
in 200036; in just the first 4 months of 2019, this number has
already been exceeded. The recent outbreaks of measles in
Washington, Minnesota, and New York exemplify what happens
when the vaccine rate is lower than required for herd immunity in
geographic centers.
UNDER-IMMUNIZATION OF SOLID ORGAN TRANSPLANT
CANDIDATES
As is the case with the general population, immunizations are a
minimally invasive, cost-effective, and safe approach to reducing
the incidence of VPIs in children who are transplant candidates.
Although immunizations will likely not prevent every case of VPI in
the immunosuppressed transplant recipient, they can help
decrease the incidence and severity of VPIs in this population.
The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the
American Society of Transplantation (AST) recommend that “solid
organ transplant candidates receive all age-appropriate vaccines
based on the Centers for Disease Control (CDC’s) annual schedule
for immunocompetent persons.”
37,38 The North American Society
for Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN), The
American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), and
the AST recommend in their joint practice guideline on evaluation
of the pediatric patient for transplant that “completion of all age￾appropriate vaccinations should occur prior to transplantation and
ideally before the development of end-stage liver disease; and
that children who have not completed the necessary vaccine
schedule can receive vaccinations on an accelerated schedule.”
39
It is crucial for immunizations to be maximized pretransplant as (1)
vaccines are more immunogenic before immunosuppressive
therapies are initiated posttransplant, (2) administration of
vaccines pretransplant increases the immunogenicity of vaccines
posttransplant, and (3) live vaccines are currently not recom￾mended for the majority of transplant recipients due to the risk of
causing vaccine-strain disease in an immunocompromised
host.40,41
Despite these recommendations, and in spite of the fact that
children with organ failure receive constant medical surveillance
given their acutely ill status, the majority of transplant recipients
are not up-to-date on age-appropriate immunizations at the time
of transplant. In a recent study of >300 pediatric liver transplant
recipients from 34 North American centers, only 29% of children
were completely up-to-date for age-appropriate immunizations
using the CDC’s standard immunization schedule and only 19%
were up-to-date using the accelerated immunization schedule for
transplant candidates.42 Under-immunization was a universal
problem across all liver transplant recipients and was not
associated with specific demographic or clinical factors. Live
vaccines were particularly under-utilized among children aged
6–11 months, suggesting that practitioners may not be aware of
the ability to accelerate live vaccines before a year of age in
transplant candidates.
ETHICS OF IMMUNIZATION IN THE SOLID ORGAN
TRANSPLANT POPULATION—CAN AND SHOULD WE REQUIRE
THAT ALL PEDIATRIC TRANSPLANT CANDIDATES BE FULLY
IMMUNIZED BEFORE RECEIVING AN ORGAN?
Currently, the decision about whether to offer transplantation to a
child who is under-immunized is left to the discretion of each
individual transplant center. In a survey of 73 North American
pediatric hepatologists, 19% stated that their program lacked any
written protocols regarding pretransplant and posttransplant
immunization policies.43 In a separate survey of 114 medical

directors, surgical directors, and transplant coordinators from 138
pediatric heart, kidney, and liver transplant programs in the United
States (US), 39% of respondents reported that their program had
encountered listing decisions involving a child whose parents or
caregivers refused vaccination; however, only 4% reported that
their program had a written policy regarding parental vaccine
refusal before transplant.44 When given a hypothetical scenario
about whether they would list such a child who was not fully
vaccinated due to parental refusal, 47% of respondents stated that
they would still list the child for transplant.
Given the growing mismatch between the number of people in
need of an organ and the number of organs available, resulting in
20 deaths on the transplant waiting list each day,45 one must ask
whether the United Network of Organ Sharing should institute a
national policy requiring complete age-appropriate immunization
for non-emergent transplants, rather than leaving this decision to
individual centers. Such a policy would prevent a patient/family
from “center shopping” to find a transplant center that does not
require immunizations.
Additionally, institution of a national policy regarding immuni￾zation for non-emergent transplant candidates would uphold
several important ethical goals including beneficence, utilitarian￾ism, and justice.46 According to the principle of beneficence, there
is a moral obligation to maximize well-being and minimize
possible harms for an individual patient.47 Vaccines are potentially
lifesaving for immunocompromised patients and should be
treated as such.46 All transplant recipients receive immunosup￾pressive medications to prevent graft rejection and therefore are
at increased susceptibility for infection. Although vaccines cannot
prevent all infectious complications, they decrease the probability
of getting VPIs that are known to cause encephalitis, meningitis,
pneumonitis, allograft rejection, and death after transplant.18,19,48
According to the principle of utilitarianism, there is an obligation
to consider the best ultimate outcome for society as a whole. With
vaccines, this is where the concept of “herd immunity” or
“community immunity” becomes important. Immunization not
only directly protects the individual vaccinee by reducing the
chance of infection and possible complications but also indirectly
benefits society by lowering the probability that non-immune
members of society will come into contact with an infectious
person and lowering the probability that the disease will
circulate.49,50 Finally, according to the principle of justice there
should be fair, equitable, and appropriate distribution of scarce
resources. Despite advances in technology and efforts to increase
organ donation awareness, there are more people in need of
organs than there are organs available. If an under-immunized
child loses a graft or dies posttransplant secondary to an infection
that was potentially vaccine-preventable, the loss of that organ
harms not only that child but every person who died on the
waiting list because no organ was available.
A CALL TO ACTION FOR THE PEDIATRIC COMMUNITY
The barriers to vaccinating pediatric transplant candidates have
not been well studied, but similar to vaccination in the general
population they are complex and will require a multi-pronged
solution. In addition to consideration of stricter policies requiring
immunizations for non-emergent transplant candidates, the
pediatric community must come together to develop new
multi-disciplinary practice guidelines to improve immunization
rates for transplant candidates who are jointly cared for by
primary care providers and subspecialists so that children do not
fall through the cracks. These policies must establish that the
standard of care is that all patients should be as up-to-date as
possible on standard vaccines by the time of transplant. The
guidelines should also provide guidance to centers on catch-up
vaccination in under-immunized patients who are being evalu￾ated for transplant, acceleration of live-virus vaccines before
transplant, and circumstances under which live vaccines should
be reconsidered posttransplant. Transplant centers need strong
national policies to guide and support their local center policies
on vaccines.
In addition to standard barriers to immunization faced by
healthy children (parental concern about vaccine side effects,
safety, and pain; lack of access to health care; lack of insurance
coverage; and moral or religious objections),51–55 transplant
candidates face unique transplant-specific immunization barriers.
These include divided care between multiple care providers, acute
medical problems that may overshadow preventative care,
inaccurate provider knowledge about vaccinating patients in the
pretransplant period, and division of the medical home between
the primary care provider and subspecialist.56 In addition, some
providers are still concerned about immunizations causing graft
rejection,57 although this has been disproven by multiple
studies.58,59 Transplant centers may also face center-specific
unique barriers and thus will need the resources (time, expertise,
financial) to identify and understand their own barriers.
To overcome these barriers, novel tools are necessary to (1)
educate subspecialists, primary care providers, and allied health
professionals about transplant-specific immunization guidelines,
(2) provide data about vaccine safety and efficacy in the transplant
population to help address and overcome potential vaccine fear
or hesitancy, (3) improve communication among patients and
their families and a medical team that consists of multiple care
providers and (4) help create automated vaccine reminders.
Health information technology (IT) solutions have been
demonstrated to facilitate patient–provider communication,
increase adherence to medical regimens, and improve outcomes
in chronic illnesses.60,61 Digital health tools on multiple technology
platforms (mobile phone, electronic medical record, and web￾based) have shown to be effective for immunization-specific
needs, including but not limited to creation of population-based
immunization registries,62–65 implementing vaccine reminder/
recall systems,66–71 providing education about vaccines for
parents and providers,72 providing automated clinical decision
support or “practice alerts,”
73–76 reducing missed vaccine oppor￾tunities, and increasing immunization rates.53,54,72,77,78 Future
cloud-based tools could be developed that are specifically tailored
to the needs of the transplant population to provide (1) education
about vaccine safety, efficacy, and use pretransplant and
posttransplant, (2) communication portals to facilitate sharing of
information between patients and multiple providers, (3) a
centrally located, easily accessible vaccine record, and (4)
automated vaccine reminders triggered from the accelerated
schedule to assist with logistics of vaccine timing. In a recent
qualitative study of 53 pediatric liver stakeholders, 94% believed
that a health IT tool would be useful in increasing pretransplant
immunization rates.56
CONCLUSIONS
Immunizations are one of the most important public health
interventions in history and are responsible for decreasing
childhood morbidity and mortality from VPIs worldwide. Each
year, we invest $1.2 billion dollars in pediatric solid organ
transplants79; however, we fail to protect our investment and
the lives and health of our patients by not ensuring that these
immunosuppressed children are fully immunized. Unfortunately,
the transplant population is not the only high-risk population of
children who remain under-immunized, as under-immunization is
also reported in children with lupus,80–83 inflammatory bowel
disease,84–87 and rheumatoid arthritis.88 As a pediatric community,
we must come together to strengthen transplant immunization
policies and utilize health IT tools to facilitate immunization
delivery in a high-risk population that is jointly cared for by
primary care providers and multiple subspecialists.
