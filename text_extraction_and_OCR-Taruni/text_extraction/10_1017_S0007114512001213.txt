Abstract
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) may play an important role in chronic diseases through the activation of inflammatory responses. The type of diet
consumed is of major concern for the prevention and treatment of these diseases. Evidence from animal and human studies has shown that
LPS can diffuse from the gut to the circulatory system in response to the intake of high amounts of fat. The method by which LPS move into
the circulatory system is either through direct diffusion due to intestinal paracellular permeability or through absorption by enterocytes
during chylomicron secretion. Considering the impact of metabolic diseases on public health and the association between these diseases
and the levels of LPS in the circulatory system, this review will mainly discuss the current knowledge about high-fat diets and subclinical
inflammation. It will also describe the new evidence that correlates gut microbiota, intestinal permeability and alkaline phosphatase activity
with increased blood LPS levels and the biological effects of this increase, such as insulin resistance. Although the majority of the studies
published so far have assessed the effects of dietary fat, additional studies are necessary to deepen the understanding of how the amount,
the quality and the structure of the fat may affect endotoxaemia. The potential of food combinations to reduce the negative effects of fat
intake should also be considered in future studies. In these studies, the effects of flavonoids, prebiotics and probiotics on endotoxaemia
should be investigated. Thus, it is essential to identify dietetic strategies capable of minimising endotoxaemia and its postprandial
inflammatory effects.
Key words: High-fat diets: Lipopolysaccharides: Gut microbiota: Intestinal permeability
The role of gut microbiota in the development of diseases such
as obesity(1), diabetes(2) and atherosclerosis(3) has received
increased attention from researchers worldwide. These diseases
share a common mechanism because the activation of the
immune system leads to greater inflammation(4–9). Components
originating from gut microbiota, such as lipopolysaccharide
(LPS), lipoteichoic acid, peptidoglycan, flagellin and bacterial
DNA, can cause immune system activation. LPS is thought to
be a major inducer of the inflammatory response, suggesting a
possible association between intestinal LPS and these metabolic
diseases(10–13).
LPS is one of the main components of the external cell wall of
Gram-negative bacteria. Therefore, the gut microbiota is a huge
reservoir of this endotoxin(14). There are 1012 bacterial cells in
each gram of faeces(15). Consequently, it is possible to detect
more than 1 g of LPS in the intestinal lumen(16,17). Under
normal conditions, the presence of LPS in the intestinal lumen
does not cause negative health effects(18). However, some fac￾tors can favour the transfer of LPS into the circulatory system.
It has been suggested that the type of diet consumed, especially
high-fat diets, can contribute to endotoxaemia, which is caused
by elevated LPS levels in blood plasma(19).
Thus, considering the impact of metabolic diseases on public
health and the association between these diseases and the
levels of LPS in the circulatory system, this review will focus
on the current understanding of high-fat diets and subclinical
inflammation and the new evidence that correlates gut

microbiota and intestinal permeability alterations with the
increase in blood LPS levels and its biological effects.
Methods
Medline/PubMed, Scielo and Lilacs were searched using the
following terms: lipids, high-fat diet, LPS, endotoxins, metabolic
endotoxaemia, inflammation, intestinal or gut permeability,
gut microbiota, chronic diseases, alkaline phosphatase, pro￾inflammatory cytokines, obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis and
inflammatory mediators. For data searches, the terms in English,
Spanish and Portuguese were used either alone or in associ￾ation. Review and original articles were selected according
to their titles and abstracts. Each selected manuscript was then
studied critically.
The role of diet in the transfer of lipopolysaccharide to the
circulatory system
It was once believed that the movement of LPS from the
intestinal lumen to the circulatory system would be effectively
inhibited by the intestinal epithelia, such that LPS would be
present in the circulation only in diseased states. However,
LPS has been detected even in the blood of healthy animals(20)
and in the plasma of healthy human subjects at low concen￾trations (between 1 and 200 pg/ml)(19,21,22), suggesting that
small amounts of LPS are constantly passing through the intes￾tines. The biological relevance of low circulatory levels of LPS
seems to be related to immune modulation. The increase in
phagocytic capacity, lymphocyte proliferation and the secretion
of lymphokines are some effects of the stimulation of the
immune system by LPS. The level of mediators produced by
the activated cells determines the beneficial effects, such as
resistance to infections, or the negative effects, such as
increased inflammation(23,24).
The greater inflammation observed in individuals with
metabolic diseases(4–9) could be a consequence of the exces￾sive production of mediators by immune cells stimulated by
LPS. Patients with obesity, diabetes, CVD and non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis have higher circulating LPS levels than healthy
individuals(25–29). Diet has been shown to play a role in increas￾ing circulatory LPS levels(19,21,30,31). Excessive fat intake may
favour an increase in circulatory LPS, leading to metabolic endo￾toxaemia(10,22,32–35). Therefore, excessive fat intake is
considered to be one of the triggering factors that increase
LPS in the circulatory system.
The oral administration of oil or water to mice confirmed
the role of fat intake in LPS movement into the circulatory
system; increases in plasma LPS levels were observed only
after the ingestion of oil. The higher the fat content of a diet
was, the higher the increase in plasma LPS levels(11). Healthy
men presented postprandial increases in LPS levels after con￾sumption of high-fat meals (33 and 50 g) when compared
to those who fasted(19,22). Because LPS contain an insoluble
fraction (lipid A) in their molecular structure(36), they can be
incorporated into micelles and absorbed and aggregated into
the chylomicrons in the postprandial period(20,37).
The transport of LPS by chylomicrons may confer a physio￾logical advantage because it favours hepatic clearance of LPS,
reducing LPS toxicity(38,39). However, excessive chylomicron
formation induced by the consumption of high-fat diets can
lead to prolonged chylomicronaemia, increasing the chances
of extra-hepatic exposure to LPS(20). Chylomicrons are secreted
into the intercellular space and they must reach the lamina pro￾pria and lymphatic vessels before entering the systemic circu￾lation. In this process, an accumulation of chylomicrons in
the intercellular space due to a high-fat diet may increase
the local pressure and cause the loosening of junctional com￾plexes between the enterocytes(40,41) or even basal membrane
rupture(42). It has been demonstrated that during fat absorption,
the intestinal epithelium becomes temporarily injured and
is repaired approximately 50 min later(43). After injury, the
gut barrier can become compromised, increasing intestinal
permeability, especially through the paracellular space, to
molecules of higher molecular weight, such as LPS.
Higher fat intake has also been shown to increase intestinal
permeability in obese rodents(44). Dietary fat can indirectly
affect intestinal permeability through the activation of mast
cells in the intestinal mucosa(45). Mast cells are directly related
to the regulation of transcellular and paracellular intestinal per￾meability through the secretion of mediators, such as TNF-a,
IL-1b, IL-4 and IL-13 as well as tryptase via protease activation
receptor-2(46), which in turn favour LPS translocation. TNF-a
levels, for example, can increase as a result of myosin
light-chain kinase phosphorylation, leading to cytoskeletal
contraction and possibly tight junction rupture(47). Reduced
expression of proteins in tight junctions, such as claudin-1,
claudin-3, occludin and junctional adhesion molecule-1, has
also been observed in the intestinal mucosa of animals fed
high-fat diets(48,49).
High-fat diets (49·5 % lipids) also induce changes in the
composition of gut microbiota, including the reduction in
Bifidobacterium spp. and Eubacterium rectale–Clostridium
coccoides (Gram-positive bacteria) as well as Bacteroides
(Gram-negative bacteria). A negative correlation between
Bifidobacterium spp. and plasma LPS levels has been observed,
and an increase in bifidobacteria induced by prebiotic intake
reduces endotoxaemia(10). Bifidobacteria can reduce the
levels of endotoxins by improving gut barrier function(50–53).
These bacteria do not degrade mucus glycoproteins, as some
pathogenic bacteria do; they instead promote a stable environ￾ment, inhibiting the translocation of bacteria and toxins(50,54).
In contrast, increasing the proportion of Gram-negative bacteria
can decrease the integrity of the intestinal mucosa and lead to
higher levels of plasma LPS(11). The administration of antibiotics
to mice fed high-fat diets resulted in changes in gut microbiota
composition accompanied by recovery of the integrity of the
intestinal epithelia (higher zonulin expression), reduction in
metabolic endotoxaemia and reduction in the caecal levels of
LPS(44). These results suggest that changes in the composition
of gut microbiota can modulate intestinal permeability and
endotoxaemia, even when a high-fat diet is consumed.
High-fat diets can induce changes in gut microbiota without
necessarily being associated with obesity. Caecal samples
obtained from rats fed high- or low-fat diets for 8 weeks were

analysed. Not all animals receiving the high-fat diet became
obese after 8 weeks, but all the animals eating the high-fat
diet showed reductions in the total number of bacteria and
increases in the relative proportion of Bacteroidales and
Clostridiales in comparison with the ones that consumed the
low-fat diet(48). These results suggest that excessive fat intake
leads to changes in the composition of microbiota without
necessarily causing obesity. The differences between obesity￾prone and obesity-resistant animals were related to an intestinal
enzyme, alkaline phosphatase, which will be discussed later.
Another consequence of the consumption of high-fat diets is
the increased production of bile observed in both obese and
lean animals(49). There is evidence to suggest a relationship
between bile secretion, microbiota in the small intestine,
increased intestinal permeability and endotoxin production.
The majority of gut microbiota are mainly located in the
caecum or large intestine. The microbiota in the small intestine
is less abundant and is usually limited as a source of LPS due to
the presence of bile. Bile represents a major challenge to the sur￾vival and colonisation of the gastrointestinal tract by micro￾organisms. The presence of IgA and mucus, which are secreted
into the bile to prevent bacterial growth, and the detergent
property of bile acids confer potent antimicrobial properties
on bile. However, it is evident that certain bacteria have evolved
to resist these antibiotic elements, and pathogens can even use
bile to regulate virulence factors(55).
Small-intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) represents
alteration in the local microbiota and is characterised by an
increased number of bacteria in the proximal small bowel
(105 colony-forming units/ml) or the presence of a lower
count of bacteria (.103 colony-forming units/ml), but with a
profile of species isolated in the jejunal aspirate that is typical
of micro-organisms that normally colonise the large bowel(56).
SIBO has been detected in obese individuals(57), suggesting
that the increased circulatory levels of LPS in response to
high-fat diet-induced chylomicronaemia might reflect changes
in the microbiota of the small intestine.
The chemical structure of bile acid and its concentration
might affect the biological effects of bile. Bile acids in the
conjugated form are necessary for the absorption of dietary
fats and have been suggested to repress bacterial growth in
the small intestine through direct antimicrobial effects and up￾regulation of host mucosal defences(58). Bile also reduces the
permeation of endotoxin by binding it to micelles in vitro (59).
Decreased conjugated bile acid secretion or increased deconju￾gation reduces the bacteriostatic properties of bile, allowing
bacterial growth, which in turn leads to more deconjugation
and, ultimately, to bacterial translocation and endotoxaemia(60).
Endotoxaemia can also reflect a direct effect of bile on intestinal
permeability. The mechanisms underlying the multifaceted
effects of bile acids on the modulation of tight junctions
are under investigation(61). Exposure of Caco-2 cells to bile
juice increased permeability through different mechanisms:
decreased protein expression in tight junctions(49), occludin
dephosphorylation(61) and reduction of transepithelial electrical
resistance through the generation of reactive oxygen species
(ROS)(62). The influence of a high-fat diet on the quantity and
composition of bile in human or animal models of obesity,
and how it affects the composition of microbiota and intestinal
permeability, should be further investigated.
Chronic high-fat diets can affect the composition of gut
microbiota, increase the incorporation of LPS into chylomicrons
and compromise gut mucosal integrity, which can result in the
entry of pathogenic agents from the intestinal lumen into the
blood stream(10,32,45). The role of dietary fat in metabolic endo￾toxaemia is of major concern, and it may partly explain the high
prevalence of chronic diseases in Western countries(63,64).
Inflammation and insulin resistance as a result of the
biological effects of lipopolysaccharide
Insulin signalling is a very complex process that involves
multiple pathways and cascades of phosphorylation events.
Interference with these signalling pathways can alter insulin
action and lead to the development of insulin resistance(65).
One of the metabolically relevant sites of insulin resistance is
white adipose tissue. The hypertrophy of adipocytes and infil￾tration of macrophages into white adipose tissue can culminate
in a higher production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as
TNF-a and IL-6, through the activation of intracellular signalling
pathways involving NF-kB and Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)
systems(66). Cytokines such as TNF-a can blunt the proper
transmission of the insulin signal by altering the pattern of
insulin-receptor substrate proteins phosphorylation(65), and
LPS can also interfere with the insulin signalling pathways.
The LPS molecule is structurally divided into three parts: lipid
A, the oligosaccharide core and the O-antigen(36). Lipid A is the
portion of the LPS molecule that is responsible for endotoxicity.
The recognition of an LPS molecule by Toll-like receptor-4
(TLR4) is mediated by the LPS-binding protein, the CD14
co-receptor of TLR4 and the myeloid differentiation protein-2.
CD14 is present in soluble form (sCD14), which is derived
from both the secretion of CD14 and the enzymatic cleavage
of the membrane form of CD14. TLR4 is present on the mem￾brane surface of immune cells (monocytes, macrophages,
Kupffer cells) and other cells (adipocytes, hepatocyte, endo￾thelial cells). Upon recognition of LPS, TLR4 undergoes
oligomerisation and recruits its downstream adaptor molecules,
TIR domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-b (TRIF)
and myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88
(MyD88), into lipid rafts of the membrane, leading to the
activation of downstream signalling pathways, such as NF-kB
and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which can lead
to inflammation(38,67,68). The translocation of NF-kB to the
nucleus promotes the activation of genes that codify proteins
involved in the inflammatory response, such as TNF-a, IL-6,
inducible NO synthase and monocyte chemotactic protein-1(69).
The signalling pathways activated by MAPK include JNK, p38
MAPK and extracellular signal-regulated kinases that can induce
insulin resistance via different mechanisms(38,70–72).
ChronicandsystemicexposuretoslightlyincreasedLPSlevels
is relevant for the manifestation of many diseases because it
induces an immune response and activates signalling pathways
that culminate with a subclinical inflammatory status, inhibiting
proper insulin signalling and leading to insulin resistance. Insu￾lin resistance is animportant component in the pathophysiology

of diseases like obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and related co￾morbidities, such as hypertension, non-alcoholic fatty liver,
cancer, and cardiovascular and renal diseases(38,73–76).
The chronic administration of very low doses of LPS to
wild-type mice results in the development of subclinical inflam￾mation, which is followed by increases in body and liver weight,
increases in the subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue and
increases in fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels(11).
In human subjects, acute administration of LPS disturbs
insulin sensitivity(77–79).
There is a network of factors that, in addition to the action of
LPS, contributes to the development of insulin resistance, such
as elevated plasma levels of NEFA and mitochondrial dysfunc￾tion(80–82) and hormone levels (reduced adiponectin or leptin
resistance)(66). The role of microbiota and molecular patterns
associated with microbes may add more complexity to this net￾work, not necessarily as a cause but as a key actor in the
relationship between diet and host. The metabolism of phos￾pholipid (phosphatidylcholine) by microbiota results in the
production of a metabolite (trimethylamine N-oxide), which
has been shown to increase the pro-atherogenic phenotype,
while the suppression of microbiota by the use of antibiotics
inhibits the progression of atherosclerosis and the production
of this metabolite(83). In another animal model of atherosclero￾sis, the interaction between genetic susceptibility, diet (high-fat
diet) and infectious agents illustrates that microbial elements are
not the cause of atherosclerotic lesions; instead, they accelerate
the progression of the disease in a susceptible host but not
necessarily in combination with a high-fat diet(84). This might
also be the case with insulin resistance; LPS may add stronger
inflammatory stimuli to a diet and genetic background that are
already unfavourable.
Intestinal alkaline phosphatase: a possible
therapeutic target
LPS clearance is fundamental to the attenuation of its negative
consequences. The liver is the main organ responsible for the
removal of LPS from the circulation. The majority of systemic
LPS are taken up by the Kupffer cells in the liver and most
probably by the endothelial cells as well. The Kupffer cells
modify the endocytosed LPS to neutralise its endotoxic
activity, passing it to the hepatocytes, which subsequently
excrete it into the bile. Some LPS is also removed directly by
hepatocytes mediated by lipoproteins(38,85).
Another important mechanism is the dephosphorylation
of LPS by the enzyme alkaline phosphatase, which induces
a 100-fold reduction in lipid A toxicity(86,87). In the liver, there
is an increase in the expression of this enzyme after LPS
injection(85). The activity of this enzyme is high in enterocyte
membranes, where the enzyme also helps to protect against
bacterial translocation and regulates duodenal pH and fat
absorption(88,89). A decrease in intestinal alkaline phosphatase
activity may decrease LPS degradation and increase circulating
LPS levels(90). Intestinal alkaline phosphatase may also exert a
protective effect systemically in addition to that conferred in
the intestinal lumen(85,89).
Many food components, including fat, proteins, carbo￾hydrates and some micronutrients, can modulate the expression
or activity of the intestinal alkaline phosphatase, depending on
the type and quantity of nutrient consumed(88). A reduction in
the activity of this enzyme was observed in the duodenal
mucosa of rats with a propensity for obesity receiving high-fat
diets(48). However, intestinal alkaline phosphatase knockout
mice gained more weight when fed a high-fat diet than wild￾type mice fed the same diet(91).
Sprague–Dawley rats fed high-fat diets presented higher
alkaline phosphatase activity in the duodenum and jejunum.
They also showed hypertrophy of the jejunal mucosa when
compared to the control group, which was fed a control diet
(9·5 % of energy from fat). However, rats receiving high-fat
diets were subsequently classified as sensitive or resistant to
obesity according to weight gain. Mice resistant to obesity
were observed to have higher intestinal alkaline phosphatase
activity(92). Some authors suggest that dietary fat content and
specific fatty acids can modulate the enzyme activity in different
ways(88,93,94). Thus, more studies are needed to determine
the relationship between fat absorption, intestinal alkaline
phosphatase activity and LPS clearance.
Recently, the importance of phosphatase in preserving gut
microbiota homeostasis and in the protection against patho￾genic bacteria was demonstrated in intestinal alkaline phospha￾tase knockout mice(95). When high-fat diets affect intestinal
alkaline phosphatase activity, it may interfere with the inter￾action between diet, microbiota and endotoxaemia, suggesting
that this enzyme can be a possible therapeutic target in the
future. The routes that may favour metabolic endotoxaemia
and related diseases in response to the consumption of high￾fat diets are represented in Fig. 1.
Future perspectives
Theeffectsoftheconsumptionoftwoisoenergeticmeals(3807kJ
(910kcal) of either a high-fat or a normal meal) wereevaluated in
healthy, lean individuals (BMI ,25 kg/m2
). The high-fat meal
induced increases in plasma LPS levels and the expression of
TLR4,ROSandNF-kBactivity(34).Theresultsofthisstudyempha￾sise the importance of reducing the amount of fat consumed to a
level required to maintain good health.
The chronic and excessive intake of fat has been asso￾ciated with the development and progression of many non￾transmissible chronic diseases. Traditionally, this association
is attributed to the biological effects of fats, such as direct acti￾vation of the innate immune system through NEFA or through
the increase in oxidation of fatty acids(96,97). Recognition of
the relationship between high-fat diets and endotoxaemia is
recent and can partly explain the manifestation and main￾tenance of a subclinical inflammatory status that favours the
development of insulin resistance and associated diseases(33).
Similar macronutrient distributions in two diets differing in fat
and carbohydrate sources have shown that the components of
the diet rather than the macronutrient composition determine
the extent of protection from developing obesity when compar￾ing germ-free and conventional mice, and those components
also exert different effects on the composition of microbiota(98).

It is important to understand how the fatty acid profile of
different lipid sources can affect endotoxaemia. As incorpor￾ation into chylomicrons and alteration of intestinal permeability
are the main routes contributing to endotoxaemia, how differ￾ent types of fatty acids can influence postprandial lipaemia
and intestinal barrier function should be further explored.
For example, creamy saturated butter has been extensively
replaced with vegetable-based ‘unsaturated’ margarines on
supermarket shelves. However, this choice may not be the
healthiest. Postprandial lipaemia and chylomicron secretion
can be modified by the fatty acid composition and physico￾chemical properties of dietary fat, which in turn may have an
impact on postprandial endotoxaemia(33). It has been observed
that the consumption of butter in a meal resulted in lower
postprandial lipaemia and chylomicron accumulation in the
circulation in young men than that in men who consumed
olive and sunflower oils(99). Moreover, oil emulsification has
been shown to result in different levels of postprandial lipaemia.
Rodents receiving emulsified sunflower oil showed higher post￾prandiallipaemiathan when they were givennon-emulsifiedoil,
most probably because emulsification increases the surface area
of oil and facilitates fat hydrolysis and absorption. Postprandial
endotoxaemia was also higher in the group fed emulsified sun￾flower oil, showing that the physico-chemical structure of fat
can affect the levels of circulating LPS as well(19).
The type of fatty acid can also influence gut barrier function.
The influence of oleic, eicosapentaenoic and DHA on intestinal
epithelial integrity through the modulation of tight junctions
has been demonstrated in vitro (100,101), suggesting that the fatty
acid profile of different foods might lead to different effects on
intestinal permeability and cause differential increases in LPS.
Recently, Laugerette et al.(102) investigated the effects of
dietary oil composition on markers of endotoxin action. Milk
fat, palm oil, rapeseed oil or sunflower oil (22·4 % lipids) was
administered to mice for 8 weeks. The palm oil group presented
the highest level of IL-6 in plasma; and the highest expression
of IL-1b, TLR4 and CD14 was in white adipose tissue(102).
LPS-binding protein is used as a marker of metabolic endotox￾aemia because it is a major LPS transporter in plasma, while
sCD14 seems to provide protective effects against the LPS
response(102), buffering the inflammatory signals by the avoid￾ance of LPS exposure to the cell-anchored membrane form of
CD14(103). The higher inflammatory response observed in
the palm oil group was correlated with a greater ratio of
LPS-binding protein/sCD14 in plasma. Rapeseed oil intake
resulted in higher levels of sCD14 than the intake of palm oil
and was associated with less inflammation in plasma and
white adipose tissue despite the higher plasma endotoxaemia.
This finding reveals that the fatty acid profile can contribute to
modulation of the onset of low-grade inflammation by influen￾cing the type of endotoxin receptors and transporters, and it
shows that higher endotoxin levels will not necessarily cause
a more intense activation of the inflammatory pathways.
Thus, components of the diet, such as fatty acids, also trigger
inflammation, and LPS, in some situations, might increase the
inflammatory burden induced by the diet.
The stimulation of adipocytes with LPS or different types of
fatty acids (myristic, palmitic, linoleic or a-linolenic acids)
shows that palmitic and linolenic acids are able to trigger
inflammation, either alone or synergistically with LPS, inducing
a greater increase in IL-6 than that of LPS alone(102). The
activation of immunological cells in the intestine can also be
influenced by the type of fatty acids, which in turn can
result in different inflammatory response patterns(45,104). In
macrophages, for example, long-chain SFA bind to TLR4 and
induce pro-inflammatory cytokine expression(105). By contrast,

medium-chain TAGwere shown toprotectratsfromLPS-induced
injuries of the gut and liver in comparison to maize oil(106).
The possibility that some specific fatty acid types can be
incorporated into the cell membrane, changing the compo￾sition of the lipid raft domain, indicates that they can shift/dis￾place signalling proteins from the lipid raft and alter the
activation of TLR4. LPS and lauric acid (medium-chain SFA)
induce dimerisation and activation of TLR4, while DHA, an
n-3 PUFA, inhibits the recruitment of TLR4 and other signalling
proteins (TRIF and MyD88) to the lipid raft. The recruitment of
TLR4 to the lipid raft is dependent on NADPH-oxidase, which
is mediated by ROS; and LPS and lauric acid increase the cel￾lular levels of ROS, while DHA reduces them(107). Thus, low￾grade inflammation induced by fatty acids is not a common
characteristic of all fatty acids(102). Therefore, although
creamy butter may seem to favourably affect lipaemia, its
fatty acid profile, which is rich in SFA, may trigger inflam￾mation independently of LPS action. How the fatty acid profile
affects bile acid secretion and absorption of the fatty acids and
of LPS, as also the increase and duration of postprandial lipae￾mia and the expression of receptors that bind to LPS and fatty
acids, should be examined.
The potential of food combinations to reduce the negative
effects of fat intake should also be considered in future studies.
Orange juice, for example, when consumed with a high-fat
meal, did not induce oxidative stress or inflammation, nor did
it increase TLR4 expression or endotoxaemia, compared to
when the same type of meal was consumed with water or a glu￾cose solution. The authors attributed this beneficial effect of
orange juice to its high levels of bioactive compounds, such as
flavonoids, naringenin and hesperidin, because they exert a sig￾nificant ROS-suppressive effect(21). In another study, orange
juice consumption did not affect the analysed parameters (sup￾pression of cytokines signalling-3, TNF-a, IL-1b, LPS, TLR4)
compared to water, cream and a glucose solution(108),
suggesting that other phytochemicals may also play an import￾ant role in the intestinal environment or systemically(31).
Endotoxaemia induced by dietary fat can also be prevented
by the administration of prebiotics and probiotics. A prebiotic
is a selectively fermented ingredient that allows specific
changes in the composition or activity of the gastrointestinal
microbiota that confers benefits upon host well-being and
health(109). Nutrients with prebiotic properties change the gut
microbiota, stimulate the secretion of intestinal hormones
such as glucagon-like peptide 1 and 2(50) and modulate the
activation of the endocannabinoid system in the intestine
and in the adipose tissue(110). All these effects contribute to
reduce gut permeability, thereby decreasing endotoxaemia,
and systemic inflammation(90). Probiotics are defined as viable
microbial dietary supplements that exert beneficial effects on
host health. Some bacterial strains reportedly inhibit TLR4
expression and/or activation in the intestinal epithelial cells(111).
Conclusions
Diet can modify the composition of gut microbiota, increase
intestinal permeability and decrease LPS clearance, favouring
metabolic endotoxaemia. This endotoxaemia, in turn, can
cause subclinical inflammation that has been associated with
the manifestation of several metabolic diseases. More studies
are necessary to deepen the understanding of how specific
nutrients or foods may affect metabolic endotoxaemia to
allow the identification of nutritional strategies capable of its
modulation. It is essential to identify dietetic strategies capable
of minimising the extension and kinetics of postprandial endo￾toxaemia. From this perspective, two principles of nutrition
guidelines seem to be very important: the types of nutrients
consumed and the combination of different food types in a
meal. This perspective offers new challenges for future studies
once current recommendations, especially for foods that are
typical sources of fat, have been reviewed. The amount of fat
consumed, the fat’s fatty acids profile and its physico-chemical
properties are important characteristics to consider. In the near
future, food will certainly be classified as pro-endotoxaemic
or anti-endotoxaemic, which will be useful for future
interventional studies.
