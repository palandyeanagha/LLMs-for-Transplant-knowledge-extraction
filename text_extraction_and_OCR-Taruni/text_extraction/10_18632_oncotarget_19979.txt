ABSTRACT
Acute kidney injury (AKI) predisposes patients to an increased risk into 
progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD), however effective treatments are still 
elusive. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of human adipose￾derived MSCs (hAD-MSCs) in the prevention of AKI-CKD transition, and illuminate 
the role of Sox9, a vital transcription factor in the development of kidney, in this 
process. C57BL/6 mice were subjected to unilateral renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) 
with or without hAD-MSC treatment. We found that hAD-MSC treatment upregulated 
the expression of tubular Sox9, promoted tubular regeneration, attenuated AKI, 
and mitigated subsequent renal fibrosis. However, these beneficial effects were 
abolished by a drug inhibiting the release of exosomes from hAD-MSCs. Similarly, 
Sox9 inhibitors reversed these protective effects. Further, we verified that hAD￾MSCs activated tubular Sox9 and prevented TGF-β1-induced transformation of TECs 
into pro-fibrotic phenotype through exosome shuttling in vitro, but the cells did not 
inhibit TGF-β1-induced transition of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. Inhibiting the 
release of exosomes from hAD-MSCs or the expression of Sox9 in TECs reversed these 
antifibrotic effects. In conclusion, hAD-MSCs employed exosomes to mitigate AKI-CKD 
transition through tubular epithelial cell dependent activation of Sox9.
INTRODUCTION
AKI is an increasingly clinical problem associated 
with high morbidity and mortality, especially among 
intensive care unit patients (>50%) [1-3]. Despite the 
fact that some AKI patients returned to normal renal 
function after supportive treatments, it shows a 25 
percent increase in the risk of dormant progression to

CKD and a 50 percent increase in mortality over a ten 
year follow-up [4, 5]. Recent epidemiological study 
strongly supports the hypothesis that AKI and CKD are 
intrinsically tied syndromes [6]. The pathophysiology 
of AKI is characterized as renal tubular epithelial 
cell damage, inflammatory infiltration and vascular 
dysfunction, which initiates the self-repair mechanism 
of the kidney [7, 8]. Nevertheless, the regenerative 
capacity of kidney is relatively limited compared to 
heart, liver and other powerful organs [9]. Generally, the 
injured kidney generates an inflammatory milieu, which 
inhibits the migration, homing and paracrine capacity 
of endogenous stem and progenitor cells into kidney 
[10]. Thus, maladaptive repair presents as the persistent 
proliferation, activation of myofibroblasts and excellular 
matrix deposited in the renal interstitium [11, 12], which 
are the hallmarks of AKI to CKD transition. However the 
underlying mechanisms of AKI to CKD progression are 
still incompletely understood, making the search for new 
and efficient therapheutic strategies an urgent necessity.
MSCs are adult stem cells with abilities of self￾renewal and multi-potent differentiation into mesodermal 
lineage cells [13], which are used to attenuate AKI induced 
by cisplatin [14, 15], hypertonic glycerol [16] and folic 
acid [17]. However, the mechanisms remain controversial. 
Fate tracing studies demonstrated that exogenous 
transplanted MSCs failed to directly differentiate into 
renal epithelial cells [18, 19]. Recent studies have shown 
that MSC-derived microvesicles or exosomes mediate the 
protective effect of MSCs in AKI by promoting the repair 
of TECs [16, 20].
Exosomes (30–100 nm) are microvesicles (MVs) 
originated from the multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and 
can be isolated from diverse body fluids and multiple cell 
culture supernatants [21-23]. The contents of exosomes 
are of a complex nature, including various types of 
proteins, RNAs, enzymes and lipids, which act as 
messengers during cell-to-cell communication [23, 24]. 
It has been reported that exosomes derived from MSCs 
mediate the regenerative process of TECs by transducing 
RNAs and micro-RNAs into TECs and endothelial cells 
in AKI models [25-27]. However, almost all these studies 
focused solely on AKI, we know very little about the 
potential role of MSCs and exosomes in the prevention 
of progression from AKI to CKD and the subsequent 
renal fibrosis.
Sox9 is a transcription factor that belongs to 
the Sex-determining region Y box family and plays a 
crucial role in the development of multiple tissues and 
organs including kidney [28-31]. It was confirmed that 
combined mutants of Sox8 and Sox9 in mice led to 
severe renal dysplasia [32]. Recent translating ribosome 
affinity purification (TRAP) studies showed that Sox9 
expression upregulated significantly within the injured 
tubular epithelium in early phase of I/R injury, and this 
activation persisted on day 28 in spite of the recovery 
of renal function [32, 33]. Further immunofluorescence 
research demonstrated that about 40% of Sox9-positive 
cells were proliferating and expanding following 
renal injury, suggesting that Sox9 might facilitate the 
intrinsic repair process of injured renal TECs [32]. 
However, these previous research did not concern the 
association of Sox9 with MSC treatment in AKI-CKD 
transition, both of which could promote the repair 
of renal tubules. Thus, we supposed that hAD-MSC 
treatment can activate tubular Sox9, thereby mitigating 
AKI and subsequent chronic kidney fibrosis via tubular 
dependent exosome shuttling. To verify this hypothesis, 
we injected hAD-MSCs or exosomes to mice subjected 
to unilateral I/R and detected the levels of Sox9. Drugs 
were injected to mice to inhibit the release of exosomes 
from hAD-MSCs or inhibit the expression of Sox9 in 
TECs.
RESULTS
The hAD-MSCs attenuated murine AKI
In this study, hAD-MSCs from patients underwent 
liposuction surgery were isolated and were cultured in 
plastic flasks (Supplementary Figure 1A). The cells were 
positive for mesenchymal markers of CD105, CD44 
and CD90, and were negative for CD34 (a mark for 
hematopoietic cells) or CD45 and CD11b (markers for 
myeloid cells) (Supplementary Figure 1B). The hAD￾MSCs were transferred to mice through tail vein on day 
1 after I/R injury (Figure 1A). An obvious ischemic zone 
was seen at the junction of cortex and medulla in injured 
kidneys when sacrificed on day 5, which was significantly 
reduced after hAD-MSC treatment (Figure 1B and 1C). 
I/R induced tubular epithelial cell edema, necrosis, tubular 
dilation, casts formation and brush border loss, which 
were significantly alleviated with hAD-MSC treatment 
(Figure 1D). To fully compare the loss of tubules, we 
used lotus tetragonolobus lectin (LTL) to detect proximal 
tubules. As shown in Figure 1E, the LTL-positive tubules 
were restored compared to the injured kidney after hAD￾MSC treatment. The kidney injury molecule 1 (Kim-1) 
was less expressed in hAD-MSC group compared with 
non-treated I/R mice (Figure 1F). We also observed that 
TUNEL-positive TECs were reduced after hAD-MSC 
treatment, accompanied by the increasing expression of 
Bcl-2 and the decreasing expression of BAX (Figure 1G 
and 1H). We did not observe any difference between the 
cell injection group (without I/R) and the control group 
(data not shown). We also examined renal function and 
found no significant change between I/R and hAD-MSC 
treated group (Supplementary Figure 2A). However, 
hAD-MSC therapy did improve renal function in folic 
acid nephropathy (Supplementary Figure 2B). These data 
suggestedthat hAD-MSC treatment alleviated murine AKI.

The hAD-MSCs promoted regeneration of TECs
Previous studies have shown that AKI 
accompanished with regeneration and repair of renal 
TECs [19, 34]. We found I/R injury induced a slight 
increase in Ki67-positive nuclei in TECs, which 
significantly increased in hAD-MSC treated group 
(Figure 2A), suggesting that hAD-MSC treatment 
promoted proliferation of TECs. However, proliferation 
doesn’t mean survived and regeneration of TECs. 
Effective proliferation in TECs is characterized as with 
the capacity to dedifferentiate and proliferate, called “self￾duplication model” [35]. To make it clear, we performed 
immunofluorescence double labeling with antibodies 
against PCNA and vimentin, whose positive in TECs 
means dedifferentiation [36]. As shown in Figure 2B, 
hAD-MSC treatment increased the proportion of PCNA 
and vimentin double positive cells than non-treated 
I/R group, suggesting that hAD-MSC promoted the 
regeneration of injured TECs.
As described previously that cell cycle arrest in 
TECs mediates kidney fibrosis after AKI [37, 38], we 
next performed immunofluorescence double labeling 
with antibodies against Ki67 and PH3 to assess the level 
of cell cycle arrest in TECs. It showed that more than 15 
percentage of TECs was double stained with Ki67 and 
PH3, indicating these cells were arrested in G2/M on day 
5 after I/R injury, which was reduced after hAD-MSC 
treatment (Figure 2A), suggesting that TECs mediated 
fibrosis was decreased after hAD-MSC treatment 
compared to non-treated I/R group.
Previous research showed that Sox9 was activated 
within TECs and might facilitate the repair of injured 
kidneys [32, 39]. We then detected the level of Sox9 in 
TECs. As shown in Figure 2C, Sox9-positive cells were 
almost invisible in control kidneys and AKI triggered a 
slight increase of tubular Sox9, however, hAD-MSC 
treatment significantly increased the expression of tubular 
Sox9, suggested that hAD-MSC treatment activated 
tubular Sox9.
Inflammatory infiltration and peritubular rarefaction 
are important promoters for the progression of renal 
injury to CKD [40-42]. We next investigated the effects 
of hAD-MSC therapy on inflammatory infiltration and 
peritubular capillary rarefaction. As shown in Figure 2D, 
I/R injury significantly reduced the percentage of CD31 
positive peritubular capillaries, while the percentage was 
increased after hAD-MSC therapy. The expression of HIF￾1α was also reduced in hAD-MSC treated group (Figure 
2E), suggesting that hAD-MSC treatment improved 
kidney hypoxia. hAD-MSC therapy significantly reduced 
the infiltration of lymphocytes (CD45 and CD3 double 
positive cells, Figure 3A) and macrophages (CD45, 
CD11b and F4/80 triple positive cells, Figure 3B) in 
the interstitium. CD3-positive lymphocytes and F4 / 
80-positive macrophages were reduced as confirmed by 
immunofluorescence in Figure 3C. As shown in Figure 3D, 
cell therapy also reduced the secretion of inflammatory 
cytokines induced by I/R and increased anti-inflammatary 
factor such as IL-10. In summary, hAD-MSC treatment 
promoted tubular repair and regeneration, through 
activating tubular Sox9, increasing the dedifferentiation 
and effective proliferation, improved cell cycle arrest 
and hypoxia, prevented the infiltration of inflammatory 
cells, which are the hallmarks for the transtion from AKI 
to CKD [37, 43], suggesting that hAD-MSCs had the 
potential to delay AKI and subsequent CKD.
The hAD-MSCs mitigated subsequent renal 
fibrosis after I/R
We next examined the effects of hAD-MSCs on 
I/R induced renal fibrosis (Figure 4A). Kidney weight 
and size were more dramatically decreased in non-treated 
I/R group compared to hAD-MSC treatment group on 
day 28 after I/R (Figure 4B and 4C). Kim-1 was also 
reduced in hAD-MSC treatment group (Figure 4D). As 
shown in Figure 4E, Sox9 was still activated in TECs 
on day 28 and there were no significant differences 
between I/R and hAD-MSC treatment kidneys. Masson 
(Figure 4F) and Sirius Red (Figure 4G) staining showed 
the collagen deposition was reduced in renal interstitium 
after hAD-MSC treatment compared to the control group. 
As the activation and proliferation of myofibroblasts is 
a key step in the development of renal fibrosis [11, 12, 
44], we then investigated the expression of proteins 
and genes associated with myofibroblasts. As shown in 
Figure 5A, the expression of specific fibrosis markers 
α-SMA and Col-I was significantly reduced after hAD￾MSC treatment compared to non-treated I/R kidneys. 
This was also confirmed by Western Blot (Figure 5B) 
and RT-PCR (Figure 5C). Previous reports suggest that 
TGF-β1/Smad2/3 is one of the most classical signaling 
pathways involved in the activation of myofibroblasts 
in organ fibrosis [45]. Thus, we examined the effects of 
hAD-MSCs on this pathway. As shown in Figure 5D, we 
found that hAD-MSC treatment significantly reduced the 
expression of TGF-b1 in left kidneys and decreased the 
phosphorylation level of Smad3 compared to non-treated 
I/R kidneys. Thus, it indicated that hAD-MSC therapy 
delayed the subsequent renal interstitial fibrosis through 
inhibiting the activation of TGF-β1/Smad 3 signaling 
pathway.
The hAD-MSCs protected injured kidneys 
through exosome shuttling
As fate tracing studies showed the engraftment of 
MSCs without a direct differentiation into mature TECs [46, 
47], we tried to confirm it by using several methods to trace 
the injectedhAD-MSCs. Firstly, hAD-MSCs were marked 
with PKH-26 (Figure 6A), and we observed only a few

labeled cells in kidneys. We then extracted AD-MSCs from 
GFP mice and injected them into I/R mice (Figure 6A). It also 
showed very little cells in the interstitium of injured kidneys. 
As shown in Figure 6B, we didn’t find out any GFP-positive 
cells in LTL-positive tubules, confirming that the injected AD￾MSCs did not directly differentiate into renal tubular cells.
Hence we further explored whether exosomes derived 
from hAD-MSCs benefit kidneys. Exosomes from hAD￾MSCs were purified and identified by transmission electron 
microscopy (Figure 6C), under which a homogenous 
pattern of spheroid particles with membrane structure 
was identified. By Western Blot, exosomes derived from 
hAD-MSCs were positive for CD63 (Figure 6D), a marker 
for membranes of intracellular vesicles. Those exosomes 
were injected into mice suffering from I/R through tail 
vein at different concentrations 24 hours after reperfusion 
(Figure 6E). Kidneys were obtained on day 7. It showed 
that exosomes derived from hAD-MSCs attenuated kidney 
injury at the dose of 100 ug (Figure 6F). In Figure 6G, 
exosome treatment reduced expression of myofibroblast 
markers, α-SMA and PDGFR-β. At the same time, the hAD￾MSC-induced attenuation of renal fibrosis was reversed 
after GW4869 treatment (Figure 6G). Thus, hAD-MSCs 
ameliorated AKI and subsequent renal fibrosis through 
paracrine of exosomes.
Sox9 was activated in TECs after hAD-MSC and 
exosome treatment
Sox9 has been reported to be the most highly 
upregulated gene in TECs upon AKI [32, 33], we next 
explored the profile of Sox9 after hAD-MSC treatment. 
We found that Sox9 was activated slightly in I/R group, 
but was dramatically activated in tubular epithelium after 
hAD-MSC or exosome treatment on day 7 of I/R injury, 
which was reversed by GW4869 inhibiting the release 
of exosomes (Figure 7A). To examine Sox9 response in 
detail, we then conducted immunofluorescence double 
labeling with antibodies against Sox9 and LTL or Kim-1. As 
shown in Figure 7B and 7C, none Sox9 or Kim-1-positive 
tubules were found in normal kidneys, in which numerous 
LTL-positive tubules were seen. We observed more LTL 
and Sox9-positive tubules after hAD-MSC and exosome 
treatment than I/R and GW4869 treated mice (Figure 
7D), suggesting that Sox9 activation may facilitate kidney 
regeneration. We also found more Kim-1-positive tubules 
in I/R and GW4869 treated mice in Figure 7B, only some 
of these tubules were Sox9-positive. Less Kim-1-positive 
tubules were observed in hAD-MSC and exosome treatment 
group, however, almost all these tubules were Sox9-
positive, suggesting that Sox9 activation mitigated kidney 
injury. We next used an inhibitor of Sox9, SB203580. 
The expression of Sox9 was reduced after drug treatment 
(data now shown), however, the expression of α-SMA and 
PDGFR-β were increased in I/R group compared to hAD￾MSC therapy group (Figure 7E).
The hAD-MSCs employed exosomes to prevent 
the transformation of TECs, not fibroblasts, into 
pro-fibrotic phenotype via activating tubular 
Sox9
Previous studies demonstrated that kidney injury 
triggers a senescence-associated profibrotic secretory 
phenotype of TECs and subsequent renal fibrosis [38, 
48]. Thus we investigated the effect of hAD-MSCs on 
TGF-β1 induced transformation of TECs into a pro￾fibrotic phenotype. After 24 hours of TGF-β1 exposure, 
the primary TECs were co-cultured with hAD-MSCs or 
exosomes in transwell chambers with or without GW4869 
for another 24 hours (Figure 8A). As shown in Figure 8B 
and 8C, the expression levels of α-SMA, Col-I, TGF-β1 
and CTGF decreased after hAD-MSC and exosome 
treatment, but were reversed by inhibiting the release of 
exosomes from hAD-MSCs. Sox9 expression in TECs 
was increased upon hAD-MSC treatment but decreased 
after inhibiting the release of exosomes from hAD-MSCs 
in Figure 8D. As shown in Figure 8E, the expression 
levels of α-SMA and Col-I were increased after inhibiting 
Sox9 in TECs. It suggested that hAD-MSCs prevented 
TGF-β1 induced transformation of TECs into pro-fibrotic 
phenotype via exosome shuttling between hAD-MSCs and 
TECs, accompanied by tubular Sox9 activation.
As activation of myofibroblasts is the key point in 
the progression of renal fibrosis [11, 12], we evaluated 
whether hAD-MSCs directly inhibit TGF-β1 induced 
activation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts (Figure 
9A). It showed that the expression levels of α-SMA 
and fibronectin were increased after TGF-β1 treatment, 
suggesting these cells were activated into myofibroblasts. 
However, it did not show a decrease of α-SMA and 
fibronectin after co-cultured with hAD-MSCs and 
exosomes (Figure 9B and 9C), which suggested that 
hAD-MSCs and exosomes did not directly inhibit the 
transformation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. We 
didn’t observe changes of Sox9 expression among each 
group in Figure 9D. We detected the same phenomenon 
in NRK49F, a cell line of rat kidney fibroblast (Figure 
9E). Thus, hAD-MSCs prevented TGF-β1 induced 
transformation of renal TECs, but not fibroblasts, into pro￾fibrotic phenotype via exosome shuttling accompanied by 
Sox9 activation, which in turn delayed the progression of 
AKI into CKD and kidney fibrosis.
DISCUSSION
We report here the finding that hAD-MSCs 
employed exosomes to attenuate murine AKI to CKD 
progression through tubular epithelial cell dependent 
Sox9 activation in model of unilateral renal I/R injury. 
The principle findings were that hAD-MSC treatment 
reduced renal pathological damage, promoted effective 
proliferation of TECs, improved cell cycle arrest of

TECs, reduced renal ischemia and hypoxia and decreased 
the infiltration of inflammatory cells. The hAD-MSC 
treatment also alleviated subsequent renal fibrosis and 
inhibited transformation of TECs, but not fibroblasts 
into a pro-fibrotic phenotype induced by TGF-β1. The 
mechanism of hAD-MSCs mitigating AKI to CKD 
progression lied in the exosome shuttling into TECs, 
thereby activating tubular Sox9, which was reversed by a 
drug blocking the release of exosomes from hAD-MSCs 
or a drug inhibiting the expression of Sox9 in TECs.

in the past few decades [49], however its mechanism is 
still unclear. Here, we have demonstrated that infusion 
of human AD-MSCs into I/R mice conferred profound 
renalprotection to the injured kidneys not only in acute 
phase also in subsequent chronic phase. Sox9 has been 
reported to be an early injury response signature within 
the kidney epithelium and take part in the intrinsic 
mechanisms regulating kidney development and repair 
[31, 32, 39, 50], however previous research did not 
associate hAD-MSCs with Sox9 activation, both of which 
had been reported to facilitate regeneration of injured 
kidneys. In this study, we have proved that hAD-MSCs 
employed exosomes to attenuate murine AKI to CKD 
progression through tubular epithelial cell dependent Sox9 
activation.
In contrast to previous reports, we have 
demonstrated that hAD-MSC therapy promoted efficient 
proliferation of TECs, which suggested that the survival 
cells from injury performed dedifferentiation and 
proliferation, and then redifferentiated into proximal 
tubular epithelium. We further reported that hAD-MSCs 
treatment changed hallmarks of AKI-CKD transition, 
manifestied by improved tubular cell cycle arrest in 
G2/M phase, reduced renal hypoxia and decreased the 
infiltration of inflammatory cells into kidney interstitium. 
Li Yang and colleagues [38] verified that TECs arrested in 
G2/M phase could not perform normal mitosis, seriously 
preventing the repair and regeneration of TECs, which 
promotes the progression of AKI. Sox9 activation has 
been proved to highlight an intrinsic cellular pathway of 
tubular regeneration in AKI [32, 50]. hAD-MSC treatment 
further promoted the activation of tubular Sox9, which 
synthetically facilitated the repair and regeneration of 
TECs through advancing the time point of proliferation 
and repair, and reducing the proportion of cells in aberrant 
cell cycle phase and improving renal hypoxia. Eirin A and 
colleagues used a porcine model of metabolic syndrome 
and renal artery stenosis and confirmed that extracellular 
vesicles derived from mesenchymal stem cells mitigated 
renal inflammation, which was mediated by IL-10 [51]. In 
our study, we also demonstated that hAD-MSC therapy 
attenuated the infiltration of inflammatory cells and 
increased the anti-inflammatory factor--IL-10, suggested 
that hAD-MSC therapy modified the inflammatory milieu 
of kidney. The ischemic, hypoxic and inflammatory 
microenvironment have been effectively improved, which 
not only reduced acute kidney injury, also attenuated 
chronic fibrosis, thereby improving renal prognosis.
Our studies confirmed that hAD-MSC treatment 
alleviated chronic renal injury and fibrosis, as had been

proved already in some previous research in models of 
unilateral ureteral obstruction [52] and folic acid [17] 
induced kidney fibrosis. However, unlike previous 
studies, we used the model of unilateral renal ischemia￾reperfusion without contralateral nephrectomy, which had 
been confirmed as a robust model for the study of AKI￾CKD progression by both histology and gene expression 
[53]. Furthermore, we verified that co-cultured TECs with 
hAD-MSCs and exosomes in vitro activated Sox9 and 
reduced TGF-β1 induced expression of proteins and genes 
associated with fibrosis. Sox9 activation in renal TECs has 
been proved to reduce fibrosis and genetic knockout of 
tubular Sox9 aggravated kindey injury and subsequent 
fibrosis [50]. In our study, inhibiting the expression of 
Sox9 reversed the beneficial effects of hAD-MSCs, which 
was consistent with previous research.
TECs have been identified to uptake exosomes and 
subsequently change the phenotype of epithelial cells by 
reducing the release of fibrosis-associated factors, while 
depleting the microRNAs in MSCs and extracellular 
vesicles obviously inhibited the intrinsic regenerative 
potential of epithelial cells [16]. Our immunofluorescence 
results confirmed that Sox9 was expressed only in TECs, 
suggesting there might exist a specific receptor for Sox9 
on TECs, thus, we assumed that hAD-MSCs might 
employ exosomes to deliver some genetic materials of 
Sox9 to TECs, or activate the tubular receptors of Sox9. 
Thus, the transcription and translation of Sox9 were 
activated in injured TECs and then synthetically promoted 
regeneration of injured kidneys. However, we found that 
co-cultured NIH3T3 or NRK49F with hAD-MSCs and 
exosomes did not reduce TGF-β1 induced activation of 
those two kinds of cells. We did not observe changes in 
Sox9 expression in NIH3T3 and NRK49F. The crosstalk 
between cells is relatively specific. Thus, it is likely to 
speculate that hAD-MSCs used exosomes to act directly 
on TECs by activating tubular Sox9, not only transmitting 
anti-fibrotic factors, also reducing the secretion of pro￾fibrotic factors from injured TECs. Its effect on fibroblasts 
in vivo might be indirect, which was accomplished by 
reducing the secretion of pro-fibrotic factors of TECs, 
subsequently inhibiting the activation of fibroblasts.
In this study, human AD-MSCs were used to treat 
murine renal injury aiming to eliminate the possibility 
of human stem cells differentiating into mouse renal 
TECs. Combining the finding that few injected cells 
were remained in the injured kidneys, we speculated 
that the protective effect of hAD-MSCs was achieved by 
paracrine action, not depending on differentiating into 
renal parenchymal cells. This hypothesis was confirmed 
by the results that the exosomes derived from hAD-MSCs 
could exert equivalent protective role as cells. This was 
supported further by our findings that inhibition the release 
of hAD-MSC-derived exosomes reversed the beneficial 
effect. These findings were consistent with previous 
research demonstrating that MSCs reduced AKI through 
paracrine [20, 54], rather than directly differentiating 
into renal parenchymal cells. With the development of 
exosomes in the field of tumors [23], it was hypothesized 
that stem and progenitor cells can secrete exosomes 
to exert organ protective effects. This hypothesis was 
verified in studies showing that exosomes extracted 
from MSCs had similar protective efficacy, which was 
inhibited by blocking the producing of exosomes and other 
microparticles [55]. Our studies showed that exosomes 
extracted from hAD-MSCs exerted renal protective 
effects and was reversed by drugs inhibiting the release 
of exosomes, which was consistent with reports in other 
organs [55, 56]. Exosomes are membranous structures 
with small diameters, which allows free shuttle between 
cells, and carry important genetic materials from the 
source cells to transfer them to target cells [21]. In our 
study, exosomes may carry mRNAs, miRNAs or proteins 
of Sox9 and deliver them to TECs, thus activated the 
receptors of Sox9 on TECs and promoted regeneration of 
injured tubules. We will clarify the specific mechanism of 
the activation of Sox9 in future studies.
In summary, our research indicated that hAD-MSC 
therapy employed exosomes to reduce AKI and subsequent 
CKD progression through tubular epithelial cell dependent 
Sox9 activation. Inhibiting the release of exosomes or the 
expression of Sox9 abolished the beneficial effects.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells
hAD-MSCs and AD-MSCs from GFP mice (Jackson 
Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were extracted from 
human adipose tissue of patients suffered from liposuction 
surgery and inguinal adipose tissue, respectively. In 
general, adipose tissue was isolated and washed in PBS 
and was homogenized and enzymatic hydrolyzed in 0.1% 
collagenase-I at 37°C for 2 hours in a 5% CO2 incubator 
with shaking every 15 minutes. Then the digestion was 
terminated by 3-5 times the volume of collagenase-I 
of complete medium. The cell suspension was filtered 
through a 70um cell strainer. The cells were cultured in 
DMEM/F12 (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS 
(Gibco, USA) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. The 
medium was changed after 48 hours and replaced every 
three days. The cells were used between the third to sixth 
passages. Stem cells were identified through differentiation 
assays and Flow Cytometry as previously described [15]. 
Cell treatment: the third generation of hAD-MSCs were 
suspended in 200uL sterile PBS and injected into mice 
with or without I/R injury through tail vein 24 hours after 
I/R. Control mice were injected with 200uL sterile PBS. In 
some experiments, mice were administrated with 2.5ug/g 
GW4869 (Sigma, USA) or equal volume of DMSO 
intraperitoneally 24hours after I/R. hAD-MSCs were 
pretreated with 20uM GW4869 or DMSO for 2 hours in 

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget 70722 Oncotarget
vitro and then were injected into I/R mice in 200uL sterile 
PBS. In some other experiments, mice were treated with 
50mg/kg SB203580 (MedChemExpresss, USA) to inhibit 
Sox9 or equal volume of DMSO intraperitoneally 24hours 
after I/R. hAD-MSCs were injected through tail wein one 
hour after SB203580 or DMSO treatment.
Isolation of hAD-MSC-derived exosomes
Exosomes were obtained from the supernatants 
of hAD-MSCs through ultracentrifugation according to 
classical methods reported in the literature [57]. hAD￾MSCs were cultured overnight in DMEM/F12 with 10% 
exosome-depleted FBS (Gibco, USA), and the medium 
was collected. The supernatants were centrifuged at 
2000g for 30minutes and filtered through a cell filter of 
0.22um to remove debris and the cell-free medium was 
then centrifuged at 100000g (Beckman Coulter, USA) for 
1hour at 4°C. The supernatants were discarded and the 
pellets were washed in M199, after which the suspension 
was centrifuged at 100000g for 1hour at 4°C. hAD-MSC￾derived exosomes were characterized by transmission 
electron microscopy and Western Blot analysis for CD63 
(Abcam, UK) expression as previously described [24].
Cell culture and treatment
Kidneys were removed from normal male C57BL/6 
mice under sterile conditions, minced and digested with 
collagenase-I for 1 hour at 37°C. The digestion was 
terminated with complete medium and the suspension 
was filtered through two cell strainers of 40um and 70um. 
Then the suspension was centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 10 
minutes. After cracking of red blood cells and washed 
twice, mTECs were cultured in flasks in DMEM/F12 
supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco, USA), 1% penicillin 
and streptomycin and other grow factors. After one week, 
mTECs were stimulated with recombinant mouse TGF-β1 
(10 ng/mL, R&D system, USA) for 24 hours and then co￾cultured with hAD-MSCs in transwell chambers for another 
24 hours. In some experiments, exosomes were added 
into mTECs which were stimulated with TGF-β1. Then 
mTECs were lysed to collect proteins and RNA. In some 
experiments, primary TECs were treated with SB203580 
(MedChemExpresss, USA, 100nM) to inhibit Sox9 before 
the intervention of TGF-β1 or hAD-MSCs or exosomes. 
NIH3T3, a cell line of mouse embryonic fibroblast, was 
bought from Procell (Wuhan, China) and was cultured in 
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco, USA) and 
1% penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were seeded in 6-well 
plates and starved for 24 hours. Then cells were incubated 
with recombinant mouse TGF-β1 (10ng/mL, R&D system, 
USA) for 24 hours without serum. NRK49F, a cell line of 
rat kidney fibroblast, was presented by Professor Gang 
Xu in our department. The cells were cultured in DMEM 
supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco, USA) and 1% 
penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were seeded in 6-well 
plates and starved for 24 hours. Then cells were incubated 
with recombinant TGF-β1 (10ng/mL, Pepro Tech, USA) for 
24 hours without serum. In some experiments, cells were 
co-cultured with hAD-MSCs or exosomes for another 24 
hours after TGF-β1 was washed away. All experiments 
were repeated for three times.
Animal model
Male C57BL/6 mice (8-10 weeks old, weighing 
22-25g, Hua Fukang, Beijing, China) were anaesthetized 
with 1% sodium pentobarbital solution (0.009 mL/g, 
Sigma, USA) by intraperitoneal injection. The left renal 
pedicle was clamped with an atraumatic vascular clip for 
30 minutes (Roboz Surgical Instrument Co, Germany) 
through a flank incision and the left kidney turned 
purple subsequent to clamping. Clamps were removed 
after 30 minutes to start reperfusion and the left kidney 
reverted to red within approximately 10 seconds. The 
body temperature was controlled at 36.6°C-37.2 °C by 
a sensitive rectal probe throughout the procedure (FHC, 
USA). The muscle layer and skin were closed with 4-0 silk 
sutures. Sham animal models were subjected to a similar 
surgical procedure without clamping the left kidney 
pedicle.
Histology and immunofluorescence
Kidneys were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 
24 hours, embedded in paraffin and sliced into sections 
(2-3um). PAS staining was used to evaluate kidney 
pathological injury, and Masson and Sirius Red staining 
were carried out to estimate the extent of tubular￾interstitial fibrosis. The tubular damage score was 
evaluated based on our previous research [58].
For IF analysis, renal sections were subjected to 
heat antigen retrieval in a microwave. The nonspecific 
antigens were blocked with serum for 30 minutes at room 
temperature. The slides were then incubated with specific 
primary antibodies against Kim-1 (1:1000, R&D system, 
USA), LTL (1:50, Vector Laboratories, USA), Ki-67 
(1:200, Abcam, UK), PH3 (1:300, Abcam, UK), α-SMA 
(1:100, Abcam, UK), Collagen-I (1:200, Abcam, UK), 
Sox9 (1:200, Abcam, UK), CD31 (1:100, BD, USA), 
vimentin (1:100, Abcam, UK), GFP (1:100, Abcam, UK) 
and PCNA (1:50, Santa Cruz, USA) at 4°C and further 
developed with fluorescent labeled secondary antibodies 
for IF. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. TUNEL was 
stained using a kit according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions (Roche, Switzerland). Staining was carefully 
quantified in each slide by capturing eight randomly 
chosen fields in a blind manner by two experienced 
renal pathologists and the data was analyzed by Image 
Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD, 
USA).

Kidney function
Blood was harvested through eyeball removal and 
centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to obtain mice 
serum. Serum urea and creatinine levels were investigated 
using colorimetric assays according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions (Bioassay System, USA).
Western blotting
Renal tissues were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer 
containing protease inhibitor. Equal amounts of proteins 
(50 μg) were loaded and separated by SDS-PAGE. The 
gel was transferred onto PVDF membranes (Roche, 
Switzerland). The membranes were blocked with 5% 
skimmed milk in TBST for 1 hour at room temperature and 
were then incubated with appropriate primary antibodies 
against α-SMA (1:2000, Abcam, UK), Collagen-I (1:1000, 
Abcam, UK), Hif-1α (1:1000, Abcam, UK), Bcl-2 (1:1000, 
Abclonal, USA), Bax (1:1000, Abclonal, USA), CD63 
(1:1000, Abcam, UK), Fibronectin (1:1000, Abcam, UK), 
TGF-β1 (1:500, Abcam, UK), Smad3 (1:1000, Abclonal, 
USA), p-Smas3 (1:1000, CellSignalingTech, USA) 
and PDGFR-β (1:1000, Abcam, UK) at 4°C overnight. 
The membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated 
secondary antibodies and were visualized by enhanced 
chemiluminescence (ECL, BioRad, USA). The relative 
expression levels were normalized to those of GAPDH 
(1:4000, Abbkine, China). The signal intensity of the 
targeted band was quantified using Image J (NIH, USA).
Quantitative real time-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from renal tissues using 
Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions 
(Invitrogen, USA) and one microgram of RNA was 
reverse transcribed into first strand cDNA using the 
GoScript reverse transcription system (Promega, USA). 
Quantitative PCR was conducted using the SYBR master￾mix (Qiagen, Germany) on the Roche light 480II. Relative 
mRNA expression levels were calculated using the 2−ΔΔCt
method and were normalized to the expression levels of 
GAPDH. The primer sequences for mice were shown in 
Table 1.
Flow cytometry
Mouse kidney tissue was diced and digested with 
Collagenase-I at 37°C for 1 hour. The suspension was 
filtered through a 40 um strainer to remove cell pellets 
and washed in PBS to generate a single cell suspension 
after lysis of red blood cells (BD, USA). The cells were 
washed twice with PBS. The third generation of hAD￾MSCs were trypsinized and washed twice with PBS. The 
cells were then incubated with the following fluorescent 
antibodies and corresponding isotype controls (Cat.
Number: 400605, 400611 and 400507, Biolegend, USA) 
for 30 minutes shielded from light at room temperature: 
FITC-conjugated anti-CD45, APC-conjugated anti￾CD11b, PE-Cy7-conjugated anti-CD3, PE-conjugated 
anti-F4/80, APC-conjugated anti-CD34, PE-conjugated 
anti-CD31, FITC-conjugated anti-CD90, APC-conjugated 
anti-CD44 and PE-conjugated anti-105 (Biolegend, USA). 
The positive cells were sorted using a BD FACS and the 
data were analysed using the FlowJo v7.6.3 software.
Statistical analysis
All results were presented as means ± SEM from 
at least three separate experiments. Statistical differences 
between two groups were analysed using the unpaired t￾test or Mann-Whitney U test by GraphPad Prism 5.0. The 
statistical significance of differences was set at P < 0.05.
