Bile acids and bile salts have essential functions in the liver
and in the small intestine. Their synthesis in the liver
provides a metabolic pathway for the catabolism of
cholesterol and their detergent properties promote the
solubilisation of essential nutrients and vitamins in the small
intestine. Inherited conditions that prevent the synthesis of
bile acids or their excretion cause cholestasis, or impaired
bile flow. These disorders generally lead to severe human
liver disease, underscoring the essential role of bile acids in
metabolism. Recent advances in the elucidation of gene
defects underlying familial cholestasis syndromes has
greatly increased knowledge about the process of bile flow.
The expression of key proteins involved in bile flow is tightly
regulated by transcription factors of the nuclear hormone
receptor family, which function as sensors of bile acids and
cholesterol. Here we review the genetics of familial
cholestasis disorders, the functions of the affected genes in
bile flow, and their regulation by bile acids and cholesterol.

E
ach day, approximately 500 mg of bile acids
are synthesised from cholesterol in the adult
human liver. Newly synthesised bile acids
are conjugated with either glycine or taurine and
subsequently secreted into bile and stored in the
gallbladder. Biliary secretion of bile salts against
a concentration gradient requires the hydrolysis
of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and this process
provides the driving force for bile flow. Because
of their detergent properties, bile acids are
inherently cytotoxic, and hence it is important
that intracellular levels of bile acids are tightly
regulated. This is largely accomplished by tran￾scriptional regulation of genes encoding proteins
involved in bile acid synthesis and transport.
Cholestasis, or impaired bile flow, is one of the
most common and devastating manifestations of
liver disease. Cholestasis is clinically charac￾terised by elevated plasma concentrations of
biliary constituents, resulting in jaundice, malab￾sorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins and, in
many cases, progressive liver damage. Both
acquired and hereditary forms of cholestasis
have been described. Familial intrahepatic cho￾lestasis syndromes can be caused by a deficiency
either in bile acid synthesis or in the transport of
bile salts into bile. Elucidation of the gene defects
underlying these hereditary cholestasis syn￾dromes is of critical importance for our under￾standing of hereditary cholestasis and,
consequently, for our knowledge of the process
of bile acid synthesis and transport.
During the last decade, many loci underlying
intrahepatic cholestasis have been mapped, the
genes have been identified, and protein functions
have been studied. Taken together with the
recent exciting discovery of nuclear hormone
receptors that act as bile acid sensors by
transcriptional regulation of key enzymes and
transporters in bile acid metabolism, these
studies have allowed a detailed understanding
of the molecular mechanisms and regulation of
bile formation. This review summarises recent
insights into the genetics of familial intrahepatic
cholestasis syndromes and the functions and
regulation of the affected proteins. We have
divided most familial cholestasis syndromes in
classes comprising bile acid synthesis defects and
bile salt transport defects because the genetic
disorders in these different classes have common
aspects in disease outcome and possible treat￾ment, which will be discussed below. We have
classified a defect in bile acid conjugation as a
synthesis defect and we tentatively consider
familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 1 (FIC1)
disease as a bile salt transport defect, although
the exact mode by which FIC1 disease causes
intrahepatic cholestasis is unknown.

transport of bile acids are essential for efficient bile flow. Bile
acids are synthesised in the liver and stored in the
gallbladder. Upon digestion of a meal, bile salts are delivered
to the lumen of the small intestine where they act as
emulsifiers of dietary lipids, cholesterol, and fat-soluble
vitamins. Bile salts are converted by intestinal bacteria,
transported from the intestine to the liver via the portal
circulation, and subsequently resecreted into bile.
Approximately 95% of bile salts are recovered in the gut
during each cycle of this enterohepatic circulation, and the
5% that are lost via the faeces are replaced by de novo
synthesis in the liver (fig 1A).
In fig 1B, some important transport proteins involved in
the enterohepatic circulation of bile salts are depicted
schematically. As can be seen from this figure, the
enterohepatic circulation of bile salts requires regulated
vectorial transport of bile salts in polarised epithelial cells,
such as the hepatocyte and the enterocyte. The bile salt
export pump (BSEP) mediates secretion of bile salts from the
apical domains of hepatocytes into bile. In the intestine, the
apical sodium-dependent bile salt transporter (ASBT) is
responsible for reabsorption of bile acids at the brush border,
while the ileal bile acid binding protein (IBABP) is thought to
transport bile acids through the cytoplasm of the enterocytes
to the basolateral membrane. A truncated form of ASBT
(tASBT) transports bile acids from the enterocytes into the
blood. At the basolateral membrane of the hepatocytes, the
sodium-dependent taurocholate protein (NTCP) and to a
lesser extent the organic anion transporter family (OATP) are
needed for the uptake of bile acids. It is incompletely
understood how the biliary epithelium, which consists of
cholangiocytes, functionally participates in bile salt transport.
It is known that ASBT is also expressed at the apical
membranes of cholangiocytes. In cultured cholangiocytes,
taurocholate is transported from the apical to the basolateral
membrane in a sodium dependent fashion. These findings
provided indirect evidence for a cholehepatic shunt pathway
for bile salts, which is further discussed elsewhere.1 2
BILE ACID SYNTHESIS
Bile acids are formed from cholesterol in the hepatocytes. In
humans two bile acids are formed: cholic acid (CA), a
trihydroxy-bile acid with hydroxyl groups at C-3, C-7, and C￾12; and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), a dihydroxy-bile acid
with hydroxyl groups at C-3 and C-7 (fig 2). Bile acid
biosynthesis is quite complex and synthesis of the full
complement of bile acids requires 17 enzymes, which
involves the addition of hydroxyl groups to the ring structure
of cholesterol and the oxidation and shortening of the side
chain3 (figs 2 and 3). In order to survive the low pH in the
intestine, bile acids are conjugated to glycine or taurine,
forming bile salts. The enzymes required for bile acid
biosynthesis are located in different cell organelles; the
addition of hydroxyl groups mainly occurs in the endoplas￾mic reticulum, whereas further ring structure modifications
are performed in the cytoplasm. Side chain modification and
conjugation are mainly performed in the peroxisomes.3 The
hepatocyte, therefore, faces an enormous challenge in
transporting intermediates throughout its interior, but the
responsible transport mechanisms are unknown.
CA and CDCA are termed primary bile acids because they
are synthesised de novo in hepatocytes. There are two main
pathways that lead to the formation of bile acids: the classical
pathway, which results in CA formation, and the acidic
pathway, which is responsible for CDCA formation. In the
intestine, bile salts undergo deconjugation by bacterial
enzymes to form an unconjugated bile acid and glycine or
taurine. Some of these unconjugated bile acids are reab￾sorbed in the ileum and returned to the liver. When primary
bile acids enter the colon, the hydroxyl group at C-7 is
removed by anaerobic bacteria, and 7-deoxy bile acids are
formed. By this process, CA is converted to deoxycholic acid
(DCA) and CDCA is converted to lithocholic acid (LCA). DCA
and LCA are called secondary bile acids because they are
formed from primary bile acids in the intestine. Both are
reabsorbed in the colon by an unknown mechanism and
returned to the liver. In the liver, DCA is conjugated with
glycine or taurine and circulates with the primary bile acids.
In contrast, LCA is conjugated with glycine or taurine and
additionally sulfated at the C-3 position. These sulfated bile
salts are secreted into bile but are not efficiently absorbed
from the intestine and are therefore eliminated from the body
via the faeces.4 5
Bile acids are cytotoxic when their concentrations increase
to abnormally high levels intracellularly or extracellularly and
this cytotoxicity is strongly dependent on their physicochem￾ical properties. CA is the most hydrophilic bile acid with three
hydroxy groups and is therefore less cytotoxic, whereas DCA
and CDCA are more harmful because they only have two
hydroxyl groups. LCA is the most cytotoxic naturally
occurring bile acid with only one hydroxyl group. UDCA, a
naturally occurring bile acid in black bears but detected in
humans only in trace amounts, is devoid of cytotoxic
properties; this bile acid is relatively hydrophilic, although
it is a di-hydroxy bile acid, but the hydroxyl group at C-7 is in
the b rather than the a configuration as in CDCA.6 UDCA is
used as a therapeutic agent in many forms of cholestasis in
order to partly replace the relatively cytotoxic bile salt pool in
human patients. The biliary bile salt pool consists mainly of
equal amounts of conjugated CA and CDCA (80%), and more
than 10% consists of conjugated DCA. Normally, only trace
amounts of the conjugated forms of LCA and UDCA are
present in bile. In the faeces, only DCA (70%) and LCA (30%)
are detected.
Because of the potential cytotoxicity of bile acids, the
expression of selected enzymes in the bile acid biosynthesis
pathway is tightly regulated by feedback inhibition and feed
forward induction processes. It is now know that the main
regulatory responses are at the level of transcription and are
largely mediated by nuclear hormone receptors and other
transcription factors, which ensure a continuous supply of
bile acids in an always-changing metabolic environment.
BILE ACID SYNTHESIS DEFECTS
Inherited mutations that impair bile acid synthesis cause a
spectrum of human disease ranging from liver failure in early
childhood to progressive neuropathy in adults. As discussed
above, the ATP-dependent secretion of bile salts provides a
hyperosmotic environment in hepatic canaliculi, which is
responsible for the subsequent secretion of water, eventually
resulting in bile flow. A decrease in bile acid availability,
secondary to biosynthesis defects, is therefore predicted to
impair bile flow. In this review, we focus on disorders that
result in intrahepatic cholestasis. In fig 3, we depicted a
simplified schematic representation of the bile acid synthesis
pathway. Only enzymes that are implicated in disease are
depicted in this figure. (For reviews of the total bile acid
synthesis pathway, see Russell3 and Chiang.7
)
Deficiency of 7a-hydroxylases
Initiation of bile acid synthesis begins with the conversion of
cholesterol to 7a-hydroxycholesterol by CYP7A1 and CYP7B1
and this is the rate-limiting step in bile acid biosynthesis.
CYP7A1 is used in the classical pathway, while CYP7B1 is
used in the acidic pathway and is preceded by 27a￾hydroxylation of cholesterol (fig 3 and reviewed in Russell3
and Chiang7
).

CYP7A1 deficiency
Mice deficient in 7a-hydroxylase activity were produced by
targeted disruption of Cyp7a1.
8 Homozygous animals
appeared normal at birth but died within the first 18 days
of life, unless their diet was supplemented with vitamins and
CA. The newborn Cyp7a12/2 mice developed neonatal
cholestasis and, due to vitamin deficiencies, oily coats,
hyperkeratosis, vision defects, and behavioural irregularities.
Cyp7b1 starts to be expressed after weaning (at 21 days after
birth) and this enzyme can probably compensate for Cyp7a1
deficiency after weaning, because Cyp7a12/2 mice that
survived through day 17 became healthy and had life spans
that approximate those of wildtype mice.8
Human CYP7A1 is located at chromosome 8q21.13 and
currently only one human family with CYP7A1 deficiency has
been described.9 In three adult patients a nonsense mutation
was detected in homozygous form, which resulted in the
truncation of the last 91 amino acid residues. Lack of CYP7A1

activity in vitro was confirmed using a mutant protein
lacking the carboxy terminal 91 amino acid residues. Patients
have hyperlipidaemia, premature coronary and peripheral
vascular disease, and premature gallstone disease, together
with a markedly reduced bile acid synthesis rate. The acidic
bile acid synthesis pathway is upregulated. However, the
severe malnutrition and neonatal cholestasis observed in
mice were not present in this family. This may reflect
differences in how bile acid synthesis is regulated between
these two species.10
The disorder appears to be inherited in an autosomal
codominant fashion because heterozygous family members
had increased serum LDL cholesterol levels in comparison
with their unaffected relatives.
CYP7B1 deficiency
CYP7B1 is located at chromosome 8q21.3 and encodes
CYP7B1, which is localised in the endoplasmic reticulum in
the cells of many tissues and hydroxylates cholesterol in the
acidic pathway. Setchell et al11 reported the only known case
of CYP7B1 deficiency. A child of consanguineous parents
presented with neonatal cholestasis and cirrhosis at 6 days of
age. Primary bile acid conjugates were absent in serum,
whereas the concentration of the highly toxic mono-hydro￾xylated 27a-hydroxy cholesterol was 4500-fold higher than
normal. Strikingly, there were no 7a-hydroxylated bile acids.
Neither CYP7A1 nor CYP7B1 hydroxylase activities were
detectable in the liver of this patient, although 7a-hydro￾xylase protein was present as evidenced by immunoblotting.
Sequence analysis revealed a nonsense mutation in exon 5
(of 6) of CYP7B1 but no mutations in CYP7A1. The truncated
CYP7B1 protein was inactive when expressed in cells.
Presumably, the accumulated 27a-hydroxysterol reduced
CYP7A1 expression or activity and resulted in a complete loss
of bile acid synthesis. Oral bile acid therapy did not improve
the patient’s condition and a liver transplantation was
performed at 4.5 months of age. Acute allograft rejection
occurred and the patient died 20 days after transplantation.
Setchell et al11 speculate that CYP7B1 mutations generally
cause prenatal or early neonatal lethality, and that this single
reported case represents an exception to fetal death. Li￾Hawkins et al12 observed that Cyp7b1 knockout mice were
phenotypically indistinguishable from healthy littermates.
They concluded that the major physiological role of Cyp7b1 is
to inactivate oxysterols and that loss of this enzyme in the
liver of mice is compensated for by an increase in the
synthesis of bile acids by other pathways. Again, the
differences between mice and man are presumably the result
of differences in regulation of bile acid synthesis between
these species.10

revealed accumulation of hepatotoxic C24 and C27 steroids.
C27 3b-HSD enzyme activity was absent in cultured
fibroblasts of this patient. Since then, several patients have
been diagnosed with C27 3b-HSD deficiency.13–15 It was only
in 2000 that HSD3B7, which encodes C27 3b-HSD, was cloned
and mapped to chromosome 16p11.2–12, and a homozygous
mutation was found in HSD3B7 of the patient previously
described by Clayton and his colleagues.13 16 This mutation
resulted in truncation of the last 23 amino acid residues and
elimination of enzyme activity in transfected cells. Bile acid
therapy leads to increased well being, a decrease in pruritus,
and a normalisation of urinary steroids in these patients.17
D4-3-Oxosteroid-5b reductase (AKR1D1) deficiency
Severe intrahepatic cholestasis was observed by Setchell et al
in two identical twin siblings in 1988.18 The parents were not
consanguineous. Jaundice, pale stools, and dark urine were
noted on the first day of life. Mass spectrometry analysis
revealed markedly reduced primary bile acid synthesis and
concomitant accumulation of D4-3-oxo and allo bile acids.
These biochemical findings, which were identical in both
infants, indicated a defect in bile acid synthesis catalysed by
D4-3-oxosteroid-5b reductase (AKR1D1). The accumulating
sterols are hepatotoxic and cause liver failure over time, a
situation which is effectively treated with oral bile acid
therapy.
Kondo et al19 cloned the human gene for D4-3-oxosteroid￾5b reductase (AKR1D1), which is located at chromosome
7q32–33.20 Mutation analysis in the twin patients has not
been reported and currently there is no mouse model
available.
Other bile acid biosynthesis defects not involving
intrahepatic cholestasis
Patients have been described with Cyp27A1 deficiency (fig 3
and table 1) which causes the neuropathological disorder
cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX).21 Bile acid synthesis
is reduced but it is the buildup of cholesterol and cholestanol
in the blood and tissues that causes xanthomata together
with cardiovascular problems. In the brain, these sterols
gradually disrupt the myelin sheaths surrounding neurons
resulting in progressive neurological dysfunction. If diag￾nosed at an early age, CTX is treated efficiently with oral bile
acid therapy.
Patients with 2-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) (fig 3
and table 1) deficiency accumulate pristanic acid and the bile
Figure 3 Schematic representation of proteins that are involved in bile flow in the hepatocyte. On the left side of the hepatocyte, a simplified
representation of bile acid synthesis is depicted; only proteins that are known to be implicated in familial disease are depicted. At the canalicular
membranes of the hepatocytes, transporters in which mutations cause cholestasis are depicted. MDR3 transports phosphatidyl choline (PC) from the
inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, the BSEP transports bile salts into the bile canaliculi, and FIC1 is thought to transport
aminophospholipids. Mutations in TJP2 and VSP33B are also associated with cholestatic disease. See text for further explanation.

acid intermediates di- and trihydroxycholestanoic acid
(DHCA and THCA) and present with adult-onset sensory
motor neuropathy, but liver function appeared normal in
these patients. Interestingly, two brothers are described with
THCA syndrome (OMIM 214950); these patients only accu￾mulate THCA and present with cholestasis and obstructive
jaundice.22 A disease locus has not yet been identified.
Finally, loss of D-bifunctional protein activity (fig 3) is
associated with the accumulation of C27 bile acid inter￾mediates and pristanic acid. Patients present with hepato￾megaly, developmental defects, hypotonia, and seizures. All
patients manifest the neurological deficiencies but only some
patients have symptoms of liver failure,23 probably due to
excretion of C27 bile acid intermediates into bile.24–26 Effective
therapy for D-bifunctional protein deficiency has not yet been
reported.
Common denominators of bile acid biosynthesis
defects
In general, bile acid synthesis defects that affect early
biosynthetic steps cause neonatal cholestasis because bile
acid intermediates accumulate in the liver. These disorders
can generally be treated with oral bile acid therapy. It is
hypothesised that bile acid therapy causes suppression of
cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase preventing further synthesis of
cholestatic intermediates (see ‘‘Regulation of bile acid
homeostasis’’ section below). One exception is CYP7B1
deficiency, with concomitantly reduced CYP7A1 activity and
expression, probably because of feedback inhibition of
CYP7A1 by C-27 hydroxylated cholesterol. This exception
could be explained by absence of feedback regulation of bile
acids on CYP27A, which is responsible for the first step in bile
acid synthesis via the acidic pathway, leading to further
accumulation of C-27 hydroxylated cholesterol.
Why do some bile acid synthesis disorders not manifest
with liver disease but with neuropathology? AMACR and
D-bifunctional protein are both localised in peroxisomes and
both cause neurological defects but liver disease only some￾times. It is thought that the bile acid intermediates that are
substrates for these enzymes can function as bile acids.24 Both
enzymes are not only involved in bile acid synthesis but also
act on branched chain fatty acids such as pristanic acid. This
explains the accumulation of pristanic acid in both disorders.
Pristanic acid, which is neurotoxic, accumulates in the
circulation and causes the progressive neuropathy in these
patients. A similar phenotype of progressive peripheral
neuropathy is characteristic for peroxisome biogenesis dis￾orders such as Refsum disease and Zellweger syndrome. In
such generalised peroxisomal disorders, these enzymes are
not functional; pristanic acid accumulation is thought to
contribute to the neurologic problems in these disorders.27
Hyperlipidaemia is observed in some of the biosynthesis
disorders. The relationship between defective bile acid
synthesis and hyperlipidaemia has long been recognised,
but its mechanism is poorly understood. It was suggested
that bile acids have an effect on the synthesis of VLDL
triglycerides, but there is also evidence that the reduced bile
acid pool causes a decrease in the activity of the nuclear
hormone receptor FXR (farnesoid X receptor) and a
corresponding decline in the expression of apolipoprotein
C-II which normally induces lipoprotein lipase activity.3 28 29
The different bile acid biosynthesis defects can easily be
distinguished from each other and from bile salt transport
defects by mass spectrometry analysis of blood and urine; all
have a characteristic pattern of accumulating bile acid
intermediates. In the past, mass spectrometry analysis has
proven to be a powerful technique for elucidating this class of
cholestasis disorders, even before their genetic basis was
known. Future studies should address whether mass spectro￾metry analysis of blood, urine, and bile samples could also
distinguish between BSEP and FIC1 disease (see below),

BILE ACID SYNTHESIS/TIGHT JUNCTION DEFECT
Familial hypercholanaemia (FHCA)
FHCA is a recently resolved genetic defect, which was
diagnosed in 12 families of Old Order Amish descent in
Lancaster County in the USA.30 Patients manifest fat
malabsorption, vitamin K deficiency, and rickets, indicating
a shortage of bile salts in the intestine. Serum bile salt
concentrations were usually elevated and cholestasis and
chronic hepatitis were sometimes observed. Symptoms could
often be reversed by UDCA treatment. A whole genome
screen in these families revealed a chromosomal region
(9q12–9q13) shared identically by descent in eight FHCA
patients. This region contained the candidate gene TJP2.
Genomic sequencing of this gene identified a homozygous
valine to alanine substitution (V48A) in these eight patients.
As three unaffected siblings were also homozygous for this
mutation, penetrance of FHCA was incomplete.
Tight junction protein 2 (TJP2) belongs to a family of
membrane-associated guanylate cyclase homologues that are
involved in the organisation of tight junctions.31 32 In the
hepatocytes, tight junctions have an important role in
separating bile from plasma and the canalicular membrane
domain from the sinusoidal membrane domain. TJP2 is
presumed to affect tight junction structure by binding to
claudins and occludin. Carlton et al30 proposed that in
patients with the V48A mutation in TJP2, bile salts enter
the bile but subsequently leak into plasma through dysfunc￾tional tight junctions, resulting in high serum bile salt
concentrations.
In five patients with FHCA the V48A mutation in TJP2
could not be detected. Carlton et al30 discovered a second
FHCA locus at 9q22–9q23, which contains the candidate gene
BAAT (bile acid CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase), the key
enzyme in conjugation of bile acids with glycine or taurine
(fig 3 and table 1). Sequencing revealed a methionine to
valine substitution (M76V) in BAAT in four individuals who
did not harbour the V48A mutation in TJP2. Unconjugated
bile acids cannot be secreted into bile by the bile salt export
pump (BSEP).33 Thus, unconjugated bile acids accumulated
in the livers of these patients, with concomitantly reduced
concentrations in bile and intestine. Strikingly, five of the
eight individuals with the homozygous V48A mutation in
TJP2 additionally presented with a heterozygous BAAT
mutation and, conversely, one patient with a homozygous
M76V mutation in BAAT also had a heterozygous V48A
mutation in TJP2. In one patient with FHCA, mutations were
not detected in TJP or in BAAT nor was this patient
homozygous at either region at chromosome 9. Therefore, a
third locus for FHCA probably exists. Interestingly in this
respect, recessive mutations in microsomal epoxide hydrolase
(mEH), which plays a central role in carcinogen metabolism
but is also able to mediate sodium-dependent uptake of bile
acids into hepatocytes, are also associated with hyperchola￾naemia.34
Carlton et al30 speculate that manifestation of FHCA
associated with homozygous TJP2 mutations requires a
concomitant heterozygous mutation in a second locus, such
as BAAT, or the third locus postulated to be associated with
FHCA. The population frequency of the TJP2 V48A mutation
is unexpectedly high (7%) for the number of FHCA patients
detected with a homozygous TJP2 mutation, indicating that
this disease has an oligogenic mode of inheritance. Both
BAAT and TJP2 may represent important genetic modifiers of
disease severity. Further studies should address whether
there are differences in clinical and biochemical presentation
in FHCA patients with distinct genetic backgrounds.
TRANSPORTER DEFECTS AFFECTING BILE
FORMATION
After biosynthesis of bile acids or reuptake of bile salts from
blood into hepatocytes, conjugated bile acids are actively
transported into the bile canaliculus, where they are the
predominant components of bile. Bile formation in bile
canaliculi is an osmotic process that largely depends on
secretion of various compounds by ATP-dependent transpor￾ters in the canalicular membrane of the hepatocytes. In this
way bile salts, and also cholesterol, bilirubin, bicarbonate,
glutathione, heavy metals, various drugs, toxins, and
phospholipids are secreted into bile. The protein pumps
responsible for the transport of these compounds are ATP￾binding cassette (ABC) transporters or transporters that
belong to the P-type ATPase superfamily. Several of these
transporter genes are associated with familial cholestasis
syndromes or other hereditary disorders in man.
Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) and
benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC) are two long
recognised autosomal recessive hereditary cholestasis dis￾orders characterised by a defect in bile secretion. However,
when these disorders were first described it was not known
that PFIC and BRIC displayed genetic heterogeneity.
Currently, PFIC is known to be associated with mutations
in ATP8B1 (PFIC1), ABCB11 (PFIC2), and MDR3 (PFIC3),
while BRIC is associated with mutations in ATP8B1 (BRIC1)
and ABCB11 (BRIC2). A subtype of BRIC with autosomal
dominant inheritance is also described, but the gene mutated
in this defect has not yet been identified.35
FIC1 disease
FIC1 disease is defined by genetic criteria: all patients have
mutations in ATP8B1. However, the disorder comprises at
least three previously described clinical entities: progressive
familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 1 (PFIC1), benign
recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis type 1 (BRIC1), and
Greenland familial cholestasis (GFC).
PFIC was first reported in an Amish family who were all
descendants of a Jacob Byler, hence the former name Byler
disease.36 Seven patients of this family suffered the same
symptoms: steatorrhoea, diarrhoea, jaundice, hepatospleno￾megaly, and failure to thrive. From the Byler pedigree it was
deduced that the disorder followed autosomal recessive
inheritance. Because patients presented with very low biliary
bile salts, but high serum levels of bile salts, a bile acid
biosynthesis defect was ruled out. Therefore, these patients
were thought to have a defect in bile salt transport.
Subsequently, homozygosity mapping identified a locus for
PFIC at chromosome 18q21–q22,37 the same locus previously
attributed to BRIC.38 BRIC was first described in 1959 by
Summerskill and Walshe39 and manifests with similar
symptoms although with episodic attacks of cholestasis.
Between attacks the patients are symptom-free and the
progressive liver damage seen at an early age in PFIC is not
seen in BRIC. Further studies revealed that both disorders
were associated with mutations in the same gene, ATP8B1,
which encodes FIC1, and currently these disorders are termed
PFIC1 and BRIC1. One other syndrome of intrahepatic
cholestasis in childhood, Greenland familial cholestasis
(GFC), was described in 16 Inuit children from Greenland.40
The patients presented shortly after birth with jaundice and
pruritus. Homozygosity mapping revealed homozygosity for a
conserved microsatellite haplotype on chromosome 18,
containing ATP8B1.
41 In 2000, Klomp et al42 identified a
homozygous missense mutation (D554N) in the ATP8B1 gene
as the cause of GFC.
All three clinical entities present with and are defined by
normal or slightly elevated gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase
(GGT) activity in serum. GGT is normally bound to the

canalicular membrane by a glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol
(GPI) anchor, but when excessive amounts of bile salts are
present in the canaliculus, the detergent activity liberates
GGT, which is usually seen in obstructive cholestasis. In FIC1
disease, however, it is thought that the reduced concentration
of bile salts in bile preserves GGT localisation at the canalicular
membrane, hence the normal GGT activity in serum.
Mutation analysis has revealed 39 different mutations in
ATP8B1 in PFIC1 patients and 19 in BRIC1 patients.38 42–47 The
ATP8B1 I661T mutation is the most common mutation in
FIC1 disease; it was detected in approximately 75% of BRIC1
patients but was associated with a remarkable variability in
clinical presentation.44 Compound heterozygosity for I661T
and other different mutations can lead to PFIC1.
Homozygosity for I661T is associated with recurrent pheno￾types and even with a symptom-free life,44 indicating
incomplete penetrance. The differences in phenotypes of
these patients with the same homozygous mutation suggest
that environmental factors and/or modifier genes play a role
in the clinical expression of FIC1 disease. Candidates for
modifier genes of FIC1 disease could be TJP2 and BAAT
(described above). Interestingly, patients from the Faeroe
Islands with the homozygous I661T mutation have similar
genetic makeup, but this group of patients still shows marked
heterogeneity in disease phenotype.47
It was postulated that BRIC1 and PFIC1 represent two ends
of a phenotypic spectrum, because both are caused by
mutations in the same gene. An intermediate form between
BRIC1 and PFIC1 was described by Van Ooteghem et al48 in
two BRIC1 patients with a splice site mutation resulting in
skipping of exon 24. These patients presented with recurrent
cholestatic bouts initially but developed progressive choles￾tasis later in life. A difference in the severity of mutations is
likely to be linked to this phenotypic continuum. Consistent
with this notion, 63% of the ATP8B1 mutations identified in
BRIC1 patients were missense mutations, whereas only 41%
of mutations associated with PFIC1 are missense mutations.
PFIC1 patients more often have nonsense and frame shift
mutations than BRIC1 patients; these mutations likely alter
protein structure and/or function severely.44 Residual activity
of FIC1 protein could be the explanation for the relative mild
phenotypes observed in BRIC1 patients. Future functional
studies should systematically address the effects of ATP8B1
mutations associated with mild and severe disease.
FIC1 is expressed at the apical membranes of different
epithelial cells: at the apical membranes of enterocytes from
the proximal to the distal intestine, of cells lining the gastric
pits, of pancreatic acinar cells, and of cholangiocytes and
hepatocytes.49–51 Strikingly, the expression in hepatocytes is
low compared to that in some other tissues. Pancreatitis and
diarrhoea are commonly observed in FIC1 disease patients
and do not resolve after liver transplantation.46 47 52 These
symptoms are probably explained by the absence of FIC1
function in pancreas and intestine in these patients. Mice
with an engineered mutation in Atp8b1, the G308V mutation
that was commonly detected in patients of Amish descent,
displayed no cholestatic phenotype and unimpaired biliary
secretion, even upon bile salt feeding, but these mice did
present with serum bile salt accumulation, weight loss,
jaundice, and hepatomegaly, suggesting that there is a defect
in the regulation of resorption of bile acids in the
cholangiocytes or enterocytes. Furthermore, Atp8b1G308V/
G308V mice counteract bile salt accumulation by enhanced
rehydroxylation of excess bile salts, indicating an important
difference between mice and humans.53
During immediate postnatal development, FIC1 expression
is hardly detectable in the intestinal tissue of newborn mice
but is specifically induced at 3 weeks of postnatal life. In
contrast, FIC1 is already expressed in liver, pancreas, and
stomach before weaning and is not further induced during
postnatal development.49
It is presently unclear how all these observations fit into a
working model of the function of FIC1 and how impairment
of FIC1 activity causes intrahepatic cholestasis. The primary
biochemical function of FIC1 is not yet known. However, it
belongs to the P4 P-type ATPase subfamily and initial
functional studies have suggested that this subfamily may
have conserved functions in the transport of aminopho￾spholipids from the outer leaflet to the inner leaflet of plasma
membranes,54–56 but this has not been unequivocally demon￾strated.57 Indeed, Ujhazy et al51 were able to demonstrate
aminophospholipid translocase activity in canalicular liver
membrane preparations which contained FIC1 protein.
Transfection of CHOK1 cells with ATP8B1 cDNA resulted in
the appearance of FIC1 in membrane preparations and
energy-dependent translocation of a fluorescent analogue of
phosphatidylserine, providing indirect evidence that FIC1
may actually represent an aminophospholipid transporter.51
How this proposed function is related to bile salt transport is
unclear.
As an aminophospholipid translocase, FIC1 might have a
role in intracellular vesicular transport, thereby regulating
proper expression or function of the canalicular transporters
such as BSEP. Such a function would be consistent with the
localisation of FIC1 at the canalicular membrane.50 51 A recent
preliminary study revealed unremarkable BSEP expression at
the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes in PFIC1 patients,
but BSEP function was not addressed.58 In addition, the
expression of P-glycoproteins at the canalicular membrane
was not affected in a PFIC1 patient.50 There are additional
hypotheses for the function of FIC1; it might be a bile salt
transporter for hydrophilic bile salts or could play a role in ion
transport, based on the 30% homology with P-type ATPases
that function as Ca2+ transporters. These hypotheses are
explained in more detail in van Mil et al59; further studies are
required to reveal how the biochemical function of FIC1 is
related to bile salt homeostasis.
Recently, Chen et al60 observed that in ileal biopsies from
PFIC1 patients and in Caco2 cells treated with ATP8B1
antisense oligonucleotides, ASBT expression was increased,
whereas FXR, short heterodimeric partner (SHP), and IBABP
showed reduced expression. The authors proposed that loss
of FIC1 expression leads to diminished nuclear translocation
of FXR. This hypothesis partly explains the pathophysiology
of FIC1 disease as pathologic alterations in the transcriptional
regulation of intestinal and hepatic bile acid transport
expression. Cholestasis presumably develops because of both
enhanced ileal uptake of bile acids via up-regulation of ASBT
and diminished canalicular secretion of bile acids secondary
to down-regulation of BSEP. Although this possible explana￾tion of FIC1 disease pathophysiology is attractive, it raises a
novel question as to how FIC1 expression regulates FXR
activity. The observed changes in transporter expression
might also be secondary to altered bile acid levels resulting
from diminished FIC1 expression or function.
Mutations in ASBT are associated with primary bile acid
malabsorption (PBAM), which manifests with chronic
intractable diarrhoea, steatorrhoea, interruption of the
enterohepatic circulation, and reduced plasma cholesterol
levels.61 Both FIC1 disease and PBAM result in chronic
intractable diarrhoea, although there are elevated and
diminished levels, respectively, of functional ASBT present,
which indicates that the pathogenesis of the diarrhoea is
different in these disorders.
BSEP disease

activity was mapped to chromosome 2q24 by homozygosity

mapping and linkage analysis.62 After locus refinement,
mutations were detected in ABCB11 (formerly called SPGP
and BSEP),63 which encodes BSEP, an ABC transporter that
was first cloned in rat. In vitro studies revealed that it
functions as a bile salt transporter and is expressed solely at
the canalicular membranes of hepatocytes.33 64–66
The knockout of Abcb11 in mice resulted in intrahepatic
cholestasis but with significantly less severity than found in
human patients with mutations in ABCB11 (PFIC2
patients).67 Biliary cholate excretion was reduced to 6% of
that of wildtype mice, but there was excretion of tetra￾hydroxylated bile salts, which were not detected in healthy
littermates. Hence, the bile salt output was 30% of that of
wildtype mice, whereas bile salt output in PFIC2 patients is
almost absent. These results suggest that hydroxylation and
an alternative canalicular transport mechanism can compen￾sate for the absence of Abcb11 in mice and this may protect
the mutant mice from liver damage.67 Crossing these mice
with several other mouse models might reveal the nature of
this alternative canalicular transport mechanism.
A large number of different mutations have been described
in patients with PFIC2.63 68 Two mutations, E297G and
D482G, are commonly detected and have been described in
25 and 16 families, respectively; at least one of these two
mutations is present in 30% of PFIC2 patients of European
descent.69 Functional studies revealed that in the case of the
E297G mutation, almost all bile salt transport activity was
abolished, probably because the mutation caused misfolding
of the newly synthesised protein.70 For the D482G mutation,
functional studies revealed conflicting results; Wang et al
reported that a mutated rat BSEP was expressed normally at
the apical membranes of MDCK cells but had diminished
activity,70 but Plass et al71 reported that mouse BSEP with the
D482G mutation was glycosylated inefficiently and was
therefore retained intracellularly. The DF508 mutation in
the ABC transporter CFTR also leads to inefficient glycosyla￾tion of the mutant protein, and the processing and stability of
mutant BSEP as well as CFTR were shown to be temperature
sensitive.66 72 73 These studies are important in elucidating the
effects of the mutations and in providing new therapeutic
strategies.
As in PFIC1, PFIC2 manifests with severe intrahepatic
cholestasis in infancy and progresses to end-stage liver
disease and death in childhood, unless a liver transplanta￾tion, a partial biliary diversion, or an ileal exclusion is
performed. There are some variable differences between
PFIC1 and PFIC2: extrahepatic features have been described
exclusively in PFIC1 patients but not in PFIC2 patients. Also,
PFIC2 often presents with non-specific giant cell hepatitis,
whereas in PFIC1, the cholestatic liver disease is typically
more bland. Despite these variable differences, it is currently
only possible to accurately distinguish between PFIC1 and
PFIC2 by genetic testing.
Recent genetic evidence implies a third locus for autosomal
recessive PFIC, because 10 families were inconsistent with
linkage to either ABCB11 or ATP8B174 and no mutations in
either ABCB11 or ATP8B1 could be detected in several PFIC
patients.44 In this last study, 83% of BRIC patients did not
harbour mutations in ATP8B1, strongly suggesting that there
is at least one additional locus underlying autosomal
recessive BRIC.
Recently, it was discovered that 11 BRIC patients from
eight different families harboured mutations in ABCB11;
these individuals are currently denoted as BRIC2 patients.75
None of these BRIC2 patients manifest with extrahepatic
features, but seven out of 11 presented with cholelithiasis. It
was speculated that supersaturation of cholesterol in bile
occurs due to diminished bile salt secretion, secondary to
impaired BSEP function,76 and that this may account for the
high incidence of gallstone formation. Interestingly, Abcb11 is
one of two candidate genes of the Lith1 locus, which is
associated with increased risk of gallstone formation in
inbred mice. Three BRIC2 patients manifest with progressive
cholestasis in the third or fourth decade of life, as was also
described for two BRIC1 patients. Therefore, it was proposed
that ABCB11 disease ranges along a phenotypic continuum,
as was described previously for ATP8B1 disease.59 The E297G
mutation that was commonly detected in PFIC2, was also
observed in homozygous form in two BRIC2 families,
indicating that other genetic and environmental factors play
a role in the phenotypic expression of ABCB11 disease. As in
ATP8B1 disease, there seems to be a correlation between the
predicted effects of mutations and the severity of the
phenotype. In this same study, 12 BRIC patients did not
harbour mutations in either ATP8B1 or ABCB11, providing
additional evidence for a third locus for autosomal recessive
BRIC and PFIC with low serum GGT activity.
MDR3 disease
Individuals with MDR3 disease are called PFIC3 patients.
PFIC3 is quite different from the other PFIC subtypes,
because serum GGT activity is usually elevated in these
patients and liver histology shows extensive bile duct
proliferation and fibrosis.77–79 The age of onset ranges from
1 month to 20.5 years of age and the most prominent
features are portal hypertension, hepatosplenomegaly, jaun￾dice, pruritus, and liver failure later in life.
The genetic background of PFIC3 was elucidated after mice
with a disruption in the Mdr2 gene, the murine orthologue of
human MDR3, were found to develop hepatocyte necrosis,
dilated canaliculi, cholangiopathy represented by portal tract
inflammation, severe ductular proliferation in the first
3 months of life, and hepatocellular carcinoma.80
The bile of Mdr2 knockout mice and PFIC3 patients is
almost devoid of phosphatidylcholine, whereas bile salt
secretion is normal. Normally, phosphatidylcholine is the
predominant phospholipid in bile. Bile salts secreted into the
bile canaliculi induce the extraction of phospholipids from
the exoplasmic leaflet of the canalicular membrane. In the
biliary tree phospholipids are of crucial importance in
protecting the cellular membranes against the high concen￾trations of bile salts by the formation of mixed micelles.
Ruetz and Gros81 discovered that Mdr2 translocates phos￾phatidylcholine from the inner to the outer plasma mem￾brane leaflet. The phenotypic and biochemical similarities
between PFIC3 patients and Mdr22/2 mice led Hadchouel,
Oude Elferick, and coworkers77–79 to investigate whether
mutations in MDR3 underlie PFIC3. This revealed 17 different
mutations in MDR3 (at chromosome 7q21) in 22 PFIC3
patients: 11 missense mutations and six mutations that were
predicted to result in a truncated protein.77–79 The truncated
MDR3 proteins could not be detected in the livers of these
patients by immunochemical methodology and almost no
biliary phospholipids were present in samples obtained from
patients affected with such MDR3 mutations, whereas
residual expression of MDR3 was observed concomitantly
with low but detectable levels of biliary phospholipids in
some patients with missense mutations in MDR3. Children
with an MDR3 missense mutation have relatively mild
disease, with late onset and a slow progression. Missense
mutations are likely associated with residual transport
activity and treatment with UDCA was beneficial in most
patients with missense mutations but not in patients with
truncating MDR3 mutations. It was hypothesised that,
despite the reduced amounts of phospholipids in bile, partial
replacement of endogenous hepatoxic bile acids by the
hydrophilic UDCA can realise a reduction of bile salt
toxicity.82 In conclusion, MDR3 disease can be associated

Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP)
Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is a reversible
form of cholestasis that may develop in the third trimester of
pregnancy and persists until delivery. The main symptoms
are pruritus and to a lesser extent, jaundice.83 84 Serum bile
salt levels are increased. The prognosis is good for the mother,
but ICP can be associated with increased incidence of fetal
distress, premature birth, and stillbirth.85 Oestrogen and
progesterone levels probably have important roles in the
pathogenesis of ICP because the disease starts in the last
trimester of pregnancy, when the hormone concentrations
are high, and resolves 1 or 2 days after delivery, when levels
of placenta-derived hormones return to normal.86 87
In ethinyloestradiol-induced cholestasis in rats, the expres￾sion of basolateral bile acid transport proteins (NTCP and
different OATPs) is inhibited at the transcriptional level,88 89
which could explain the etiology of cholestasis in ICP.
Besides hormonal factors, genetic factors play a role in ICP.
A higher incidence of ICP has been observed in mothers of
patients with PFIC1, PFIC3, or BRIC1,36 90 91 indicating that
heterozygous mutations in genes involved in bile formation
predispose to ICP, thereby underscoring the contribution of
genetic factors to the development of ICP. More frequently,
ICP occurs in women with no known family history of PFIC.
In some of these patients heterozygous mutations were
detected in MDR3.
92 93 Savander et al94 genotyped 16 indivi￾duals from two Finnish ICP families for markers flanking
ABCB11, ATP8B1, and MDR3, but linkage to any of these genes
was excluded, indicating that further genetic heterogeneity in
ICP is expected. Known genes involved in the regulation of
bile acid metabolism are good candidates for factors
predisposing to ICP. Finally, environmental factors might
also increase the risk for ICP. This is indicated by the fact that
ICP recurs in less than 70% of pregnancies in multiparous
women and by the decline in ICP prevalence rates in Chile
over the last decade.95 Furthermore, the incidence of ICP is
reported to be higher in winter than in summer.96
During ICP, there is an increased flux of bile salts from the
mother to the fetus and it is hypothesized that the placental
transfer capacity for bile salts is reduced. This might result in
decreased fetal elimination and retention of toxic bile salts by
the fetus, which may explain the higher risk of premature
birth and stillbirth in these pregnancies.97 98 UDCA has been
shown to be beneficial in ICP mothers and the incidence of
fetal loss decreases.99 Furthermore, because stillbirths occur
late in pregnancy, labour is induced in these women before
term.
OTHER FAMILIAL INTRAHEPATIC CHOLESTASIS
SYNDROMES
ARC syndrome/VPS33B deficiency
ARC syndrome refers to an autosomal recessive association
between arthrogryposis, renal tubular dysfunction, and
cholestasis. It has become apparent that there is notable
clinical variability, even within the same family. Cases may
even be undiagnosed as not all patients present with these
three cardinal features.100 101 Additional symptoms have been
reported in some patients, including diarrhoea, cerebral
malformation, nerve deafness, nephrogenic diabetes insipi￾dus, and failure to thrive. Most patients die by the age of
7 months, but those who exceed this age have shown severe
developmental delay.102
The GGT activity in serum in these ARC patients with
neonatal cholestasis is low, indicative of decreased amounts
or absence of biliary bile salts, and suggestive of a defect in
bile salt transport. Because of the multiplexity of the ARC
syndrome, a general membrane transport defect was
expected.103 Since it is expressed in multiple tissues, including
brain, liver, kidney, intestine, and skeletal muscle, ATP8B1
was suspected as a candidate gene mutated in this disorder,
but mutations in ATP8B1 were excluded by Gissen et al.
104
Recently, it was demonstrated that recessive mutations in
VPS33B at chromosome 15q26.1 cause ARC syndrome.105 Nine
different mutations have been characterised, the majority
leading to truncated VPS33B proteins. VPS33B encodes a
homologue of the yeast S cerevisiae class C vacuolar protein
sorting 33 gene (Vps33) which is important in the regulation
of the fusion of intracellular vesicles with the plasma
membrane. VPS33B interacts with members of the syntaxin
family of t-SNAREs, thereby probably influencing vesicle
SNARE to target SNARE complex assembly, an essential step
in determining the specificity of heterotypic membrane
docking and fusion. The clinical features of ARC syndrome
are consistent with abnormal intracellular protein trafficking
and defective membrane fusion mechanisms. The neonatal
cholestasis with low GGT activity observed in these patients
is probably caused by the absence of bile salt transport
proteins at the canalicular membranes of these patients.
Consistent with this observation, the polarised localisation of
a canalicular marker protein, carcinoembryonic antigen
(CEA), was markedly disturbed in liver biopsies of ARC
patients.105
Lymphoedema-cholestasis syndrome (LCS) or
Aagenaes syndrome
Patients with LCS (lymphoedema-cholestasis syndrome),
also called Aagenaes syndrome, suffer from severe neonatal
intrahepatic cholestasis and develop lymphoedema in their
youth. In most patients, the cholestasis lessens during early
childhood and becomes episodic, as in BRIC. A few patients,
however, manifest with cirrhosis and death in early child￾hood, or develop cirrhosis as adults. The lymphoedema,
which can start at birth or in early childhood, becomes
chronic and severe, mainly affecting the lower extremities
but also the hands, scrotum, and periorbital soft tissues.
Aagenaes first described LCS in patients in an isolated
population in the south west of Norway. To date, there have
been many published cases: most are Norwegian but some
are of other origin.106 107 Bull et al mapped a locus for LCS to
chromosome 15q in Norwegian patients,107 but the gene has
not yet been identified. Interestingly, the locus for LCS
reported by Bull et al contains VPS33B, which is mutated in
ARC syndrome, and both disorders manifest with develop￾mental defects. Sequencing of VPS33B in LCS patients is
therefore warranted. In a consanguineous Serbian Romani
LCS family no linkage was detected at chromosome 15q,
suggesting that locus heterogeneity exists for LCS.108
It is not know whether the normal GGT cholestasis in this
syndrome is a direct or a secondary feature of the LCS gene
defect. Cholestasis might develop due to abnormal function
of the lymphatic system or both lymphatic vessels and bile
ducts might develop abnormally.109 110 Perhaps the livers of
LCS patients are able to compensate for the gene defect in
LCS later in life.107
North American Indian childhood cirrhosis/Cirhin
deficiency (NAICC)
North American Indian childhood cirrhosis (NAICC) is a
rapidly evolving form of familial cholestasis with autosomal
recessive inheritance found in Ojibway-Cree children from
north western Quebec in Canada.111 112 The disease manifests
with transient neonatal jaundice, which progresses to biliary
cirrhosis requiring hepatic transplantation in childhood or
young adulthood. Histological samples show early bile duct
proliferation and rapid development of portal fibrosis and
biliary cirrhosis, suggesting involvement of bile ducts rather

than bile canaliculi. A missense mutation in Cirhin at
chromosome 16q22 has been detected in these patients. The
secondary structure predicts that this protein contains 10 WD
repeats (also known as WD40 or beta-transducin repeats),
which are short motifs of approximately 40 amino acids,
often terminating in a Trp-Asp (WD) dipeptide. WD repeats
are implicated in the organisation of proteins into complexes
and are thus involved in many processes such as signal
transduction, vesicular trafficking, cytoskeletal assembly, and
transcription initiation complex assembly.113–115 The elucida￾tion of the function of Cirhin requires further studies.
Furthermore, since all patients with Cirhin deficiency
currently are from one isolated population, the clinical
presentation of NAICC may expand when other unrelated
patients with Cirhin deficiency are identified.
REGULATION OF BILE ACID HOMEOSTASIS
Because of the intrinsic toxicity of bile acids, bile acid
synthesis and transport must be tightly regulated. It is now
apparent that members of the nuclear hormone receptor
family of lipid-activated transcription factors are key reg￾ulators of these physiological processes. Nuclear hormone
receptors, after sensing inappropriate oxysterol and bile acid
levels, are transcription factors that initiate the genetic
transactivation of DNA response elements in promoter
regions of target genes to modulate the synthesis of bile
acids and their enterohepatic circulation. The four key
nuclear hormone receptors that regulate bile acid home￾ostasis are FXR, VDR, PXR/SXR, and LXR, although others
have been described (for reviews, see Betard et al,
113 Chagnon
et al,
114 Smith et al,
115 Chawla et al,
116 Goodwin et al,
117 and
Redinger et al118). FXR, PXR/SXR, and VDR bind bile acids and
are therefore sensors of excessive amounts of bile acids,
whereas LXR is a cholesterol sensor and binds oxysterols.
These nuclear hormone receptors act as heterodimers; RXR,
the retinoid receptor, is an obligatory partner in this
heterodimer.
When bile acid levels increase in hepatocytes, the farnesoid
X receptor (FXR) binds bile acids, which then activates
transcription of short heterodimeric partner (SHP). SHP
inhibits transcription of LRH1, the liver receptor homologue
1, which normally transactivates CYP7A1 and CYP7B1.
Consequently, bile acid synthesis is inhibited (fig 4).10 SHP
is also responsible for the inhibition of the transcription of
NTCP, encoding the principal importer of bile salts at the
basolateral membrane; this leads to a reduction of bile salt
absorption into hepatocytes (fig 4).119–121 On the other hand,
FXR induces transcription of BSEP resulting in enhanced
secretion of excessive bile salts into bile (fig 4).122 Hence, FXR
functions as a bile acid sensor to maintain low bile acid
concentrations in hepatocytes. In the intestine, FXR facil￾itates bile salt secretion into the portal circulation through
induction of the ileal bile acid binding protein (IBABP) gene
(fig 4).123 Mice lacking the nuclear bile acid receptor Fxr
developed normally but are distinguished from wildtype mice
by elevated serum and hepatic bile acid, cholesterol, and
triglyceride levels. Fxr2/2 mice also had reduced bile acid
pools and reduced fecal bile salt excretion due to decreased
expression of BSEP. These data demonstrate that FXR is
critical for bile acid and lipid homeostasis.124
The pregnane X receptor (PXR) can be activated by the
toxic bile acid LCA. PXR inhibits transcription of CYP7A1125
but also stimulates transcription of CYP3A4, a cytochrome P￾450 enzyme that detoxifies secondary bile acids by mono￾oxygenation leading to formation of more hydrophilic bile
acids (fig 4). The vitamin D nuclear receptor (VDR) binds
vitamin D but also LCA at low concentrations, which also
results in induction of CYP3A4 expression in the enterocytes
and cholangiocytes, which explains how the enteric system
and the biliary epithelium could protect themselves from the
harmful effects of LCA (fig 4).126 127 This may be the secondary
defence protecting the liver against the accumulation of
highly toxic bile acids.128 When cholesterol levels increase in
hepatocytes, oxysterols activate the liver X receptor a (LXRa)
to induce CYP7A1 to convert excess cholesterol into bile
acids.129 This provides a feed-forward mechanism to primarily
regulate cellular cholesterol levels rather than bile acid levels.
Bile salt homeostasis is also regulated at the posttransla￾tional level. Oestradiol-17b-D-glucuronide has been shown to
induce an acute and completely reversible cholestasis in the
rat. The mechanism of pathogenesis of cholestasis is
explained by the induction of endocytic internalisation of
both Bsep and Mrp2 by oestradiol-17b-D-glucuronide,
thereby rapidly reducing the number of canalicular trans￾porters. Mrp2 is an ABC type transport protein that secretes
glutathione but also the lithogenic sulfated and glucuronated
bile salts across the canalicular membranes of hepato￾cytes.130 131 Bile duct ligation in the rat, a well known
experimental model of cholestasis, also resulted in decreased
Mrp2 protein at the canalicular membrane accompanied by
intracellular localisation of the protein in pericanalicular
vesicular structures.130–132 In any case, these events provide a
rapid way to regulate the cell surface expression of bile salt
transporters based on cellular demand and further studies of
the molecular mechanisms governing this posttranslational
regulation may permit the development of novel therapeutic
approaches to prevent or ameliorate the clinical symptoms of
cholestasis.
CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE
PERSPECTIVES
Identification of genes involved in familial intrahepatic
cholestasis has proven to be an important strategy to unravel
the processes of bile acid synthesis and bile salt transport.
The complexity of the mechanisms of bile flow clearly
suggests that many more genetic abnormalities have yet to
be identified. Consistent with this hypothesis, numerous
unexplained familial cholestasis syndromes are known and
the affected genes are likely to have a role in bile flow (for a
list of these syndromes see Jansen et al133). Identification of
the genes involved in these syndromes will further enhance
our insight into bile formation and cholestasis.
Polymorphisms in these genes may cause an individual’s
response to changes in bile acid homeostasis to vary and may
be genetic modifiers of disease severity. Genes involved in the
regulation of bile acid homeostasis are candidate genes for
idiopathic hereditary cholestasis syndromes.
Mass spectrometry analysis remains an important tool for
future studies to elucidate enzyme defects in bile acid
synthesis and further studies should reveal whether this
application can also distinguish between specific transport
defects. Microarray and proteomic approaches that compare
RNA or protein expression patterns in livers from patients or
mouse models with different forms of familial cholestasis,
could identify new players in bile flow but may also be tools
to recognise specific gene defects. Such approaches will also
define common pathophysiological pathways responsible for
liver damage in different forms of intrahepatic cholestasis.
Phenotype-genotype correlation studies are possible for
those disorders in which many different mutations have been
identified. In FIC1 disease, BSEP disease, and MDR3 disease,
a correlation between the types and location of distinct
mutations in the affected genes and the severity of the
patient’s phenotype has been observed. These observations
need to be complemented by additional functional studies
that allow determination of the impact of distinct mutations
on protein localisation, expression, and function. Often,
missense mutations cause relatively mild symptoms and it

is thought that residual activity of the mutated proteins
explains this observation. Novel therapeutic approaches for
these patients might be found by inducing the expression of
the mutated proteins. Recent knowledge concerning the
regulation of bile acid homeostasis by nuclear hormone
receptors is promising in this respect, because specific
agonists and antagonists of nuclear hormone receptors are
now being developed. Not only might specific genetic
disorders be treatable with such agonists and antagonists,
but symptoms of patients with acquired forms of cholestasis
might also improve using this approach. UDCA has recently
been found to be effective in ameliorating intrahepatic
cholestasis in some cases not only because it replaces the
toxic endogenous bile acid pool by the less toxic, less
hydrophobic bile acid UDCA, but also because it is a ligand
for PXR. PXR transactivates CYP3A4, resulting in enhanced
detoxification of bile acids.134 Other PXR agonists such as
rifampicin, often used for treatment of cholestasis, may also
enhance CYP3A4 expression. Furthermore, FXR agonist
GW4064 has been shown to enhance Bsep expression
resulting in increased bile salt export from mouse hepato￾cytes.135 Combined therapy with PXR and FXR agonists holds
great promise as a potential remedy for cholestasis symp￾toms.
Gene defects in bile acid synthesis are often treatable with
bile acid supplements. For deficiencies in canalicular export,
however, orthotopic liver transplantation or partial external
biliary diversion are still the best treatment options. In
addition to drug therapy, other remedies have to be explored.
Genes that are exclusively expressed in the liver are good
candidates for gene therapy: restoration of gene function
should confer a selective advantage in bile acid handling to a
population of hepatocytes.136 However, these approaches to
curative therapy may be far away.

Figure 4 Role of nuclear hormone receptors in transcriptional regulation of bile acid synthesis and transport. In response to high concentrations of bile
acids, bile acid synthesis and absorption in the hepatocyte are decreased, whereas bile salt secretion and detoxification are increased due to nuclear
hormone receptor action. In the enterocyte, detoxification of secondary bile acids is increased and the secretion of bile acids into the portal venous
system is eventually enhanced by transcriptional activation of IBABP. See text for further explanation.
