Abstract
Introduction: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are adult, multipotent, stem cells with immunomodulatory
properties. The mechanisms involved in the capacity of MSCs to inhibit the proliferation of proinflammatory T
lymphocytes, which appear responsible for causing autoimmune disease, have yet to be fully elucidated. One of
the underlying mechanisms studied recently is the ability of MSCs to generate T regulatory (Treg) cells in vitro and
in vivo from activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), T-CD4+ and also T-CD8+ cells. In the present
work we investigated the capacity of MSCs to generate Treg cells using T-CD4+ cells induced to differentiate
toward the proinflammatory Th1 and Th17 lineages.
Methods: MSCs were obtained from mouse bone marrow and characterized according to their surface antigen
expression and their multilineage differentiation potential. CD4+ T cells isolated from mouse spleens were induced
to differentiate into Th1 or Th17 cells and co-cultured with MSCs added at day 0, 2 or 4 of the differentiation
processes. After six days, CD25, Foxp3, IL-17 and IFN-γ expression was assessed by flow cytometry and helios and
neuropilin 1 mRNA levels were assessed by RT-qPCR. For the functional assays, the ‘conditioned’ subpopulation
generated in the presence of MSCs was cultured with concanavalin A-activated CD4+ T cells labeled with
carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester. Finally, we used the encephalomyelitis autoimmune diseases (EAE) mouse
model, in which mice were injected with MSCs at day 18 and 30 after immunization. At day 50, the mice were
euthanized and draining lymph nodes were extracted for Th1, Th17 and Treg detection by flow cytometry.
Results: MSCs were able to suppress the proliferation, activation and differentiation of CD4+ T cells induced to
differentiate into Th1 and Th17 cells. This substantial suppressive effect was associated with an increase of the
percentage of functional induced CD4+
CD25+
Foxp3+ regulatory T cells and IL-10 secretion. However, using mature
Th1 or Th17 cells our results demonstrated that while MSCs suppress the proliferation and phenotype of mature
Th1 and Th17 cells they did not generate Treg cells. Finally, we showed that the beneficial effect observed
following MSC injection in an EAE mouse model was associated with the suppression of Th17 cells and an increase
in the percentage of CD4+
CD25+
Foxp3+ T lymphocytes when administrated at early stages of the disease.
Conclusions: This study demonstrated that MSCs contribute to the generation of an immunosuppressive
environment via the inhibition of proinflammatory T cells and the induction of T cells with a regulatory phenotype.
Together, these results might have important clinical implications for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.

Introduction
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent stromal
cells characterized by their ability to differentiate into
cells from mesodermal tissue making them an interest￾ing cell source for application in regenerative medicine
[1,2]. Another attractive potential of MSCs is their cap￾acity to inhibit the proliferation of T and B lymphocytes,
natural killer and dendritic cells both in vitro and in vivo
[3-6]. These immunosuppressive abilities are mediated
by different mechanisms specific for human or mouse
MSCs, such as indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) or ni￾tric oxide (NO), respectively, or overlapping suppressive
factors, such as transforming growth factor β1 (TGF￾β1), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and IL-10 among others
[7-9]. Moreover, it has been shown that MSCs are able
to generate CD4+
CD25+high Foxp3+ T regulatory (Treg)
cells in vitro, from activated human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC), mouse splenocytes or iso￾lated T-CD4 cells. Indeed, MSCs promote the induction
of CD4+
CD25+high regulatory cells from human PBMC
cells activated with IL-2 [10]. In the same line, Maccario
et al. demonstrated that MSCs favor the differentiation
of CD4+ T-cell subsets co-expressing CD25 and/or
CTLA4, two markers of Treg cells [11]. These observa￾tions were supported and extended by a study showing
that direct MSC-T cell contact is required for Foxp3 and
CD25High expression by CD4+ T cells; however, soluble
factors produced by MSCs, such as TGF-β1 and PGE2,
also played a non-redundant contribution in the ge￾neration of CD4+
CD25+
Foxp3+ [8]. A role for other
molecules including the human leukocyte antigen-G5
(HLA-G5) and the stress inducible enzyme heme￾oxygenase-1 (HO-1) has also been described in the ge￾neration of regulatory T cell phenotype mediated by
human MSCs [12,13]. The ability of MSCs to induce
such a regulatory phenotype in T cells was described
both in vitro and in vivo. As an example, in a mouse ani￾mal model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the
beneficial effect of injected human adipose derived
MSCs (hASCs) on the clinical and histological scores of
mice was associated with an increased number of CD4+
CD25+
Foxp3+ and CD4+
IL10+ cells in the lymph nodes
[14]. The induction of a regulatory T cell phenotype
population has also been shown in clinical applications.
Indeed, a significant induction of CD4+
CD25+
Foxp3+ cells
was observed in two systemic lupus erythematous (SLE)
patients [15]. Moreover, after autologous MSC administra￾tion in patients with kidney transplantation, Perico et al.
reported not only an increase in the number of CD4+
CD25+
Foxp3+ cells but also a substantial decrease of the
activity of CD4+ and CD8+ effectors as well as a subse￾quent improvement in their renal function [16].
In the context of inflammatory diseases, T helper 1
(Th1) and Th17 T cell subsets are well known to
mediate inflammation [17,18]. Interestingly, we showed
that MSCs inhibit human Th17 cell differentiation and
function and induce a regulatory T cell phenotype [19].
This result revealed that, even under inflammatory con￾ditions, MSCs exert in vitro anti-inflammatory effects
through the induction of a regulatory T cell phenotype.
However, the capacity of MSCs to generate functional
Treg cells in vitro during the differentiation process or on
fully differentiated Th1 and Th17 cells still remains to be
elucidated. Therefore, in this study, we explored the
capacity of MSCs to generate, in vitro, functional CD4+
CD25+
Foxp3+ Treg cells under Th1 and Th17 inflamma￾tory culture conditions. In parallel, in the experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, we assessed
the percentage of regulatory T cells after MSC administra￾tion at two different time points post-immunization. The
aim of this study was to determine whether MSCs are able
to increase the percentage of regulatory T cells in vitro
when co-cultured with either CD4+ cells induced to diffe￾rentiate into Th1 and Th1 or with fully differentiated Th1
and Th17 cells and in vivo in the EAE model.
Methods
Isolation and characterization of mouse mesenchymal
stem cells
MSCs were isolated from eight- to ten-week-old C57BL/
6 mice. Bone marrow cells were collected by flushing fe￾murs and tibias and the cell suspension (1 × 106
cells/cm2
)
was plated in a modified minimum essential Eagle's
medium (MEM) © (α-MEM, Gibco, Auckland, NZ) sup￾plemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone,
Thermo Fisher Scientific, Brebières, France), 2 mM glu￾tamine and 100 U/mL penicillin with 100 mg/mL strepto￾mycin (Gibco, Auckland, NZ) (α-20). At sub-confluence,
cells were replated at a density of 20,000 cells/cm2 and,
after the second passage, MSCs were isolated by negative
selection using a CD45+ microbeads kit (Miltenyi Biotec,
Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany). MSCs were characterized
for expression of hematopoietic and mesenchymal cell an￾tigens by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) ana￾lysis and by their capacity to differentiate into adipogenic,
chondrogenic and osteogenic lineages as previously de￾scribed [20].
Th1 and Th17 differentiation and MSC cocultures
CD4+ T cells from spleen of C57BL/6 mice were purified
by negative selection using the CD4+ T cell Isolation Kit
MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufac￾turer’s instructions. Purified CD4+ T cells were cultured
in complete medium containing RPMI 1640 supplemen￾ted with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mM l-glutamine,
100 U/mL penicillin/100 μg/mL streptomycin. In a
24-well plate, 2 × 106 CD4+ T cells were cultured in the
presence of 2.5 μg/ml coated antibodies against CD3 and

1.5 μg/ml CD28 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA)
under Th1 or Th17 differentiation conditions. Th1 cells
were differentiated with 20 ng/ml of IL-12 (R&D Systems,
Minneapolis, MN, USA) and 2.5 μg/ml anti-IL-4 anti￾bodies (BD Biosciences). Th17 cells were differentiated
with 50 ng/ml IL-6 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN,
USA), 5 ng/ml of TGF-β1 (BioVision, Milpitas, CA USA)
and 2.5 μg/ml of anti-IFN-γ and -IL-4 antibodies (BD Bio￾sciences). MSCs were added at a MSC:Th ratio of 1:10 or
1:100 at day 0, 2 or 4 of the Th1 and Th17 differentiation
process. After six days of culture, relative cell quantifica￾tion was measured using the CellTiter-Glo™ luminescent
cell viability assay (Promega, Charbonnières-les-Bains,
France) and intracellular cytokine detection was measured
by flow cytometry.
Analysis by flow cytometry
After six days of culture, T cells were stimulated for
four hours with 50 ng/ml phorbolmyristate acetate
(PMA) (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) and 1μg/ml
ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), prior to the addition of 10
μg/ml brefeldin A (eBiosciences, San Diego, CA, USA).
For the detection of surface markers, cells were stained
with CD4-PEcy5 (eBiosciences) and CD25-PE-texas red
(Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) and incubated for
20 minutes at 4°C in the dark. After two washing steps,
we performed intracellular staining for IFN-γ-FITC, IL￾17-PE or FoxP3-Alexa488 detection. For that purpose,
cells were fixed and permeabilized using the Cytofix/
Cytoperm™ (BD Biosciences) kit according to the manu￾facturer’s instructions. Acquisition was performed with a
Coulter Epics-XL flow cytometer using the System II
software (Coulter Corporation, Brea, CA, USA). Analysis
was performed using the FCS express software (De novo
softwares, Los Angeles, CA, USA).
Functional assay
After six days of co-culture at different times post￾T-CD4+ activation (0, 2 and 4), the ‘conditioned’ Treg
subpopulations generated from Th1 and Th17 cells
cocultured with MSCs (cond-Th1 or cond-Th17 cells)
were evaluated for their ability to suppress allogenic T
cell proliferation. For that purpose, fresh T-CD4+ cells
were labeled with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester
(CFSE) and cocultured with or without cond-Th1 or
cond-Th17 cells at different ratios in the presence of
1 μg/ml of concanavalin A (ConA) (Sigma-Aldrich).
After 72 hours, the proliferation of CD4+ T cells was an￾alyzed on a FACS Canto II using the BD FACSDiva soft￾ware measured by flow cytometry.
Quantification of cytokines
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) from
R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA) for IL-10 and
the Enzyme Immunoassay kit from Arbor Assays (Ann
Arbor, MI, USA) for PGE2 were used. IL-10 and PGE2
were quantified from the supernatants of cocultures
which were stored at −20°C until tested.
MSC purification from Th1 and Th17 cocultures
MSCs were washed three times with a PBS/0.05mM
ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) buffer in order
to detached lymphocytes from MSCs. Then, MSCs were
trypsinized and resuspended in α-20 and cultured for
two hours. After this time, MSCs were washed three
times with a PBS/0.05mM EDTA to eliminate possible
resting contamination with lymphocytes. The percentage
of MSCs was 98%.
RT-qPCR analysis
Total RNA from purified MSCs and from Th1 and Th17
cells was extracted in the presence or absence of MSCs
using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen S.A., Courtaboeuf,
France). RNA (500 ng) was reverse transcribed using the
Multiscribe reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems,
Courtaboeuf, France). Quantitative PCR was performed
using the SYBR Green I Master kit and a LightCycler®
480 Detection System, following the manufacturer’s rec￾ommendations (Roche Applied Science, Meylan, France).
Specific primers for IL-10, TGF-β1, Helios, Foxp3 and
Nrp1 were designed using the Primer3 software [21].
Briefly, 50 ng cRNA were amplified and the analysis of
mRNA expression level was performed using the Roche
LightCycler® 480 software 1.5. Expression levels of tran￾scripts were normalized to the housekeeping gene ribo￾somal protein S9 (RPS9). For quantification, values were
expressed as the relative mRNA level of specific gene ex￾pression as obtained using the 2−ΔCt method.
EAE induction and treatment protocols
Female C57BL/6J mice, six- to eight-weeks old, were
purchased from the Faculty of Medicine, Universidad de
Chile (Santiago, Chile). All animals were housed and
treated according to the guidelines of the Animal Ethical
Committee of our Institution (Universidad de los Andes,
Chile). Mice were immunized according to a previously
published protocol using 50 μg MOG35-55 (LifeTein,
Detroit, MI, USA), emulsified in Complete Freund’s
Adjuvant (CFA; Difco, Detroit, MI, USA) containing
4 mg/ml Mycobacterium tuberculosis H35RA (strain
H35Ra; Difco, Detroit, MI, USA) and injected subcu￾taneously [22]. Immunization with MOG35-55 was
followed by intraperitoneal administration of 350 ng per￾tussis toxoid (Sigma-Aldrich) on days 0 and 2. Mice
were injected with 1 × 106 MSCs on days 18 and 30 after
immunization. Clinical score was recorded daily and

assigned according to a standard and validated 0 to 5
scale [23]. At day 50, the mice were euthanized and
splenocytes and draining lymph nodes (drLN) were
extracted and cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 10% of heat-inactivated FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine
and 100 U/mL penicillin/100 μg/mL streptomycin in
24 well plates for four hours with 50 ng/ml PMA and
1 μg/ml ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), in the presence
of 10 μg/ml brefeldin A (eBiosciences) for intracellu￾lar staining.
Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as the mean ± (SEM). Individual
experiments were carried out between three and seven
times to ensure reproducibility. Generated P values and
post-analyses were performed with the Kruskal–Wallis
test, considering non-normal distributions with small
sample sizes and multiple groups and the Mann–Whitney
test to compare between two groups. P-values <0.05 (*),
P <0.01 (**) or P <0.001 (***) were considered statistically
significant. Analysis and graphical representation were
performed using Graph-Pad Prism™ software (Graphpad,
San Diego, CA, USA).
Results
Phenotypic and functional characterization of murine MSCs
Murine bone marrow-derived MSCs were successfully
isolated by negative selection with the CD45+ micro￾beads isolation kit. After passage seven, MSCs had a
stable fibroblast-like phenotype and were positive for the
mesodermal surface antigens CD90, CD29, SCA-1 and
CD44 and negative for the hematopoietic markers CD45
and CD11b as shown in Figure 1A. MSCs were also
functionally capable of differentiating into adipocytes,
chondrocytes and osteoblasts under inductive culture
conditions showing their multipotent characteristics
(Figure 1B).
MSCs inhibit the activation, proliferation and differentiation
of Th1 and Th17 cells
The effect of MSCs on the activation, proliferation and
Th1 or Th17 differentiation was assessed using purified
CD4+ T cells activated with anti-CD3/CD28 monoclonal
antibodies (mAb) under Th1 or Th17 skewing conditions.
MSCs were added at day 0, 2 or 4 post-activation. First,
we showed that under Th1 and Th17 culture conditions,
IFN-γ-producing cells and IL-17-producing cells, respec￾tively, were generated after six days of culture (Figure 2).

Under these conditions, the addition of MSCs at the
beginning of the differentiation process (day 0) highly
reduced the number of activated CD4+
CD25+ T cells,
whatever the ratio used (Figure 3A). This effect was still
significant when MSCs were added at day 2. Interestingly,
while MSC addition did not affect the activation state of
fully differentiated Th1 and Th17 cells, they significantly
suppressed the latter mature T cells when added at the
highest ratio (Figure 3B). We then studied the effect of
MSCs on the T cell differentiation process toward Th1
and Th17 and observed a significant inhibition of the per￾centage of IFN-γ-producing Th1 and IL-17-producing
Th17 cells. However, the percentage of IL-17-producing
mature Th17 cells co-cultured with MSCs was not af￾fected at the lowest MSC:T-cell ratio tested (Figure 2).
MSCs induce functional CD4+
CD25+
Foxp3+ T cells during
the differentiation process of Th1 and Th17 cells
Previous studies have shown that MSCs induce CD4+
CD25+
Foxp3+ T regulatory cell phenotype from PBMC
or CD4+ activated cells in vitro [8,10,11]. In the present
study, we investigated the capacity of MSCs to induce
functional Treg cells when co-cultured with T cells
induced to differentiate toward Th1 or Th17 cells. Flow
cytometry analysis revealed that MSCs increased the
percentage of CD4+
CD25+
Foxp3+ T cells only when they
were added at day 0 or 2 of the differentiation processes
(Figure 4A). This latter increase of Foxp3 was confirmed
at the RNA level (Figure 4B). Moreover, we showed an
up-regulation of IL-10 production in the supernatants
(Figure 5A). Since we demonstrated that MSCs sup￾pressed the proliferation of CD4+
T cells undergoing Th1
or Th17 differentiation we hypothesized that MSCs
generate induced CD4+
CD25+
Foxp3+ T cells. To test
that hypothesis, we investigated whether the CD4+
CD25 +
Foxp3+ T cells obtained in the co-cultures with MSCs
were natural (nTregs) or induced (iTregs) by determi￾ning the expression levels of surface Nrp1 and helios, an
ikaros family transcription factor [24-26]. We showed
that CD4+
CD25+
Foxp3+ T cells generated in the co￾cultures with MSCs expressed significantly lower levels
of helios and Nrp1 when compared to the Th1 or Th17
differentiated T cells cultured in absence of MSCs. These
results strongly suggest that MSCs might generate iTreg
cells rather than stimulating the expansion of nTreg cells
(Figure 4B).
Figure 2 MSCs inhibit Th1 and Th17 differentiation depending on the stage of activation and cell ratio. The differentiation of Th1 and
Th17 cells was measured by intracellular detection of IFN-γ and IL-17 positive cells, respectively, from purified CD4-T cells differentiated into Th1
and Th17 cells in the presence or absence of MSCs at different stages of activation and different MSC:Th ratios (left: representative dot plot: 1:10
upper panels and 1:100 lower panels). ** = P <0.01 and * = P <0.05, n = six for Th1 and n = seven for Th17. Values represent means ± SED for six
and seven independent experiments for Th1 and Th17 cells, respectively. MSCD0, D2 and D4 = MSC added at day 0, 2 and 4 of the
differentiation process, respectively. MSCs, mesenchymal stem cells; Th, T helper.

Finally, in a functional test, we assessed the suppres￾sive capacity of conditioned Th1 or Th17 (Th1cond or
Th17cond) cells obtained after MSC addition at day 0 or
2 of the T cell differentiation processes (Figure 5B). By
using different ratios of Thcond cells:CD4+ (1:1; 1:2 or
1:5), we showed a dose dependent capacity of the condi￾tioned cells to inhibit the proliferation of activated CD4+
T cells (Figure 5B). In contrast, conditioned T cells ob￾tained from the co-cultures of mature Th1 or Th17 cells
with MSCs did not modulate the proliferation of ConA
activated T cells (data not shown).
PGE2, TGF-β1 and IL-10 are up-regulated in the
cocultures of MSCs with Th1- or Th-17 cells
Several studies have shown that soluble factors including
PGE2, TGF-β1 and IL-10 are directly involved in Treg
cell induction [27]. Therefore, we quantified PGE2
production in the supernatants of the co-cultures of
MSCs with differentiating or mature Th1 or Th17 cells
(Figure 6A). Compared to MSCs, Th1 or Th17 cells
cultured alone, the secretion of PGE2 was significantly
increased in the supernatants of the co-cultures. No
significant difference was observed between the MSC:

of activation of Th1 and Th17 cells. T cell activation was measured using purified CD4+ T cells differentiated into Th1 or Th17 cells in the presence
or absence of MSCs according to the expression of the activation surface antigen CD25 (left: representative dot plot: 1:10 upper panels and
1:100 lower panels). B) MSCs suppress Th1 and Th17 cells independent of the stage of activation and cell ratio. Relative cell quantification was
determined using purified CD4+ T cells differentiated into Th1 or Th17 cells in the presence or absence of MSCs added at day 0, 2 or 4 after T cell
activation and at a MSCs:Th ratio (1:10 and 1:100), using the Cell Titer Glo™ luminescence assay. RLU = relative light units. MSCs, mesenchymal

T cell ratios tested or between differentiating or ma￾ture Th1 or Th17 cells. Then, using quantitative PCR
we measured the expression levels of these molecules
in MSCs after co-culture with either differentiating or
mature Th1 and Th17 cells. We found that all MSC
co-cultures tested were able to increase the mRNA
expression levels of TGF-β1 and IL-10 in MSCs
(Figure 6B).

Finally, we addressed whether MSCs could affect the
generation of Th1, Th17 and CD4+

Foxp3+ Treg
cells in a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease such as
EAE. MSCs were administrated at day 18 and 30 after
EAE induction in mice and the clinical scores were
recorded daily until day 50. Compared to the control

group, we observed an early improvement of clinical score
when MSCs were administrated at day 18 (Figure 7A).
This beneficial effect was observed shortly after MSC
injection and maintained for ten days. However, MSC ad￾ministration at day 30 did not improve the EAE symp￾toms. Then, the percentage of CD4+
IFN-γ+
, CD4+ IL-17+
and CD4+
CD25+
Foxp3+ T cells in lymph node cells and
splenocytes were measured at day 50. We observed a sig￾nificant decrease of Th17 cells and an increase of CD4+
CD25+
Foxp3+ T cells only in the lymph nodes of EAE
mice that received MSCs at day 18 (Figure 7B and 7C).
Compared to the control group, the percentage of Th1
cells was not modified (Figure 7B) and the different T cell
sub-populations studied were not affected in the spleens
after the MSC treatments (data not shown).
Discussion
The capacity of MSCs to suppress the proliferation of
T-cells has opened new perspectives for their clinical
use. Currently, it is well established that MSCs rely on
different mechanisms to exert their suppressive proper￾ties. One important mechanism is the capacity of MSCs
to generate functional Treg cells, as shown in the last
decade. The demonstration that direct MSC–T cell in￾teractions induce T cells with regulatory properties has
arisen from a number of studies describing the ge￾neration of Treg populations with typical phenotypic
characteristics [10,11,28]. Later on, Prevosto et al. de￾monstrated that CD4+
CD25+
Foxp3+ cells, generated
from PBMC after three days of culture with MSCs, were
functional and inhibited the proliferation of alloantigen￾activated T cells [29]. Another study established that
MSCs were able to induce Treg cells from CD4+ T lym￾phocytes via cell contact as well as a non-redundant
contribution of PGE2 and TGF-β1 [8]. These and other
studies confirmed that Treg cell generation was contact￾and soluble factors-dependent and priming of MSCs was
required for an immunosuppressive effect [30]. However,

the MSC potential to stimulate the proliferation of na￾tural Tregs or to induce Tregs when co-cultured with
Th1 or Th17 cell subsets has not been investigated. There￾fore, we explored the ability of MSCs to induce functional
CD4+
CD25+
Foxp3+ regulatory cells, when cultured in the
presence of activated CD4+ T cells submitted to Th1 or
Th17 skewing conditions. We first showed that MSCs
strongly suppress the proliferation, activation and differen￾tiation of Th1 and Th17 cells when added at early stages
of the differentiation processes regardless of the cell ratio
tested. However, MSCs added at the highest ratio in the
presence of fully differentiated Th1 and Th17 cells were
able to significantly reduce the percentage of the mature
T cells as well as their proliferation rate. Moreover, we
showed for the first time that under these culture con￾ditions, MSCs were able to generate iTreg cells expres￾sing low levels of Nrp 1 and helios. The generation of
CD4+
CD25+
Foxp3+ regulatory T cells was not observed
when MSCs were added to mature Th1 or Th17 cells.
Furthermore, we showed that the latter iTreg cells were
functional and suppressed the proliferation of activated
CD4+ T cells.
It is now well established that the generation of Treg
cells is mainly induced by the presence of TGF-β1 and
IL-10 cytokines [31,32]. It has also been shown that
PGE2 is involved in increased expression of Foxp3 in
T-CD4+ cells [33] and that MSCs are able to produce
PGE2, TGF-β1 and IL-10 [8,29]. Therefore, we deter￾mined the expression levels of IL-10 and TGF-β1 in
MSCs and the concentration of IL-10 and PGE2 in the
supernatants of MSCs co-cultured with Th1 or Th17
cells. In parallel to the Treg generation, we found that
IL-10 production was significantly increased in superna￾tants of the co-culture when MSCs were added at day 0
or 2 of the differentiation processes. Along the same
line, under the same conditions we reported a significant
increase of IL-10 and TGF-β1 mRNA expression level in
MSCs. However, we did not find an increase of IL-10

MSCs co-cultured in the presence or absence of Th1 and Th17 cells. B) IL-10 and TGF-β1 expression was quantified in the supernatants of MSCs

production in the supernatants of MSCs when cultured
with fully differentiated Th1 or Th17 cells. We also
showed an increase of PGE2 production in the superna￾tants of MSCs cultured with both differentiating or ma￾ture Th1 and Th17 cells. This observation supports
other studies revealing that PGE2, TGF-β1 and IL-10
may play a critical role in the induction of Treg cells by
MSCs [8,19].
Finally, we used an experimental murine model of
EAE to evaluate the effect of MSCs injected at different
time points post-immunization on the percentage of
Th1, Th17 and CD4+
CD25+
Foxp3+ Treg cells. Since a
single injection of MSCs at an early stage of the disease
has been shown to improve EAE symptoms [34], in this
study we performed one injection of MSCs at different
stages of EAE. Our results demonstrated that MSCs
were able to improve the clinical signs of EAE only
when they were administrated at the peak of the disease.
This therapeutic effect was associated with both a sig￾nificant decrease of Th17 cell numbers and an increased
percentage of CD4+
CD25+
Foxp3+ Treg cells in the
lymph nodes. Interestingly, MSCs injected at the later
time point neither diminished the percentage of Th17
cells nor increased the percentage CD4+
CD25+
Foxp3+
Treg cells. No effect was observed on Th1 cells.
Contradictory results have been previously reported
following MSC injection showing either an increase of
the Treg population associated with a therapeutic effect
or describing an absence of any beneficial effect in dif￾ferent animal models of autoimmune diseases [14,35,36].

In the present study, we confirmed the generation of
Treg cells following MSC injection in parallel with an
improvement in the clinical signs of EAE.
Conclusion
Taken together, these data demonstrate that MSCs are
able to induce functional Treg cells during the differenti￾ation process of Th1 and Th17 cells. The generation of
Treg cells was associated with an increase of IL-10 pro￾duction in the supernatant of the co-cultures and
resulted in the inhibition of the proliferation, activation
and differentiation of Th1 and Th17 cells. These data
were confirmed in the EAE model, in which the thera￾peutic effect of MSCs on disease progression was asso￾ciated with an increase of the percentage of Treg cells
when MSCs were administrated at a specific time point
during disease progression.
