Abstract
Human Papillomaviruses (HPV) cause widespread infections in humans, resulting in latent infections or diseases ranging
from benign hyperplasia to cancers. HPV-induced pathologies result from complex interplays between viral proteins and the
host proteome. Given the major public health concern due to HPV-associated cancers, most studies have focused on the
early proteins expressed by HPV genotypes with high oncogenic potential (designated high-risk HPV or HR-HPV). To
advance the global understanding of HPV pathogenesis, we mapped the virus/host interaction networks of the E2
regulatory protein from 12 genotypes representative of the range of HPV pathogenicity. Large-scale identification of E2-
interaction partners was performed by yeast two-hybrid screenings of a HaCaT cDNA library. Based on a high-confidence
scoring scheme, a subset of these partners was then validated for pair-wise interaction in mammalian cells with the whole
range of the 12 E2 proteins, allowing a comparative interaction analysis. Hierarchical clustering of E2-host interaction
profiles mostly recapitulated HPV phylogeny and provides clues to the involvement of E2 in HPV infection. A set of cellular
proteins could thus be identified discriminating, among the mucosal HPV, E2 proteins of HR-HPV 16 or 18 from the non￾oncogenic genital HPV. The study of the interaction networks revealed a preferential hijacking of highly connected cellular
proteins and the targeting of several functional families. These include transcription regulation, regulation of apoptosis, RNA
processing, ubiquitination and intracellular trafficking. The present work provides an overview of E2 biological functions
across multiple HPV genotypes.

Introduction
Papillomaviruses are non-enveloped small DNA viruses, of
which over 140 types infect humans (HPV). HPV are strictly
epitheliotropic, with specificity for stratified epithelia of the skin
(cutaneous HPV) or genital and oral mucosa (mucosal HPV). They
are either associated with asymptomatic infections or induce
benign proliferative lesions, which have the potential to progress
toward malignancy for the ‘high risk’ HPV (HR-HPV). Although
carcinogenic conversion occurs only in a minority of infections,
mucosal HR-HPV are associated with almost all cervical cancers,
and with 50% anogenital and 30% head and neck cancers [1]. In
addition, growing evidence point to a role of some cutaneous HPV
in non-melanoma skin cancer [2]. Therefore, from inapparent
infections to cancers, HPV cover a large spectrum of diseases in
humans [3].
The productive viral cycle both depends on and perturbs the
differentiation of infected keratinocytes [4], and HPV pathogenesis
relies on complex interplay between early viral and host proteins.
The carcinogenic conversion of HR-HPV-associated lesions
proceeds from a deregulation of virus-host cross-talk, leading to
over-expression of E6 and E7 viral oncogenes and to the
accumulation of cellular genetic alterations. This long-lasting
process culminates in the emergence of fully-transformed cells
critically dependent on the immortalizing properties of the HR￾HPV E6 and E7 proteins to drive continuous cell proliferation.
The HPV E2 early protein is a pivotal factor of both productive
and persistent infection. It provides the control of viral DNA
transcription, replication and mitotic segregation through specific
binding to the viral genome. Such activities are shared by all HPV
and are mediated by E2 interactions with cellular transcription
factors, mitosis-associated factors, and with the viral E1 helicase
(see [5,6] for review). As such, the E2 protein is mainly envisioned
as a basic viral factor. Contrary to the E6 and E7 proteins, the
involvement of E2 in the different features of HPV pathology is
elusive. Indeed, only few studies demonstrated that E2 functions
may differ between oncogenic HR-HPV and the Low-Risk HPV
(LR-HPV), which are always associated with benign hyperplasia.
Some activities are specific of the HR-HPV E2 proteins, such as
the induction of apoptosis or of a G2/M cell cycle arrest [7–9]. In
PLoS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 1 June 2012 | Volume 8 | Issue 6 | e1002761

addition, the HR-HPVE2 proteins induce genomic instability [9],
and E2 from cutaneous HPV8 exhibits intrinsic oncogenic
potential when expressed in the skin of transgenic mice [10],
pointing to a role of E2 in the carcinogenic conversion of HR￾HPV associated lesions (see [11] for review).
Given the major public health concern caused by genital
cancers, the activities of viral early proteins have been far more
extensively studied for mucosal HR-HPV than for other HPV.
However, the variability of HPV-associated lesions indicates that
the interplay among viral and host proteins may strongly differ. A
global understanding of cell alterations generated by viral proteins
according to the tropism and pathogenic potential is currently
lacking. To make progress in this issue, we mapped the virus-host
protein-protein interactions of the E2 proteins from 12 genotypes
representative of HPV diversity. We selected HPV of different
tropism specificity (cutaneous: HPV1, 3, 5, 8, 9 or mucosal:
HPV6, 11, 16, 18, 32, 33, 39) and with different pathogenic
potential (LR-HPV 1, 3, 6, 9, 11, 32 or HR-HPV 5, 8, 16, 18, 33,
39). This selection spans over three clades of the typical HPV
phylogeny based on the sequence of the L1 capsid protein [12]: a￾types HPV 3, 6, 11, 16, 18, 32, 33, 39; b-types HPV 5, 8, 9 and m￾type HPV 1. Interaction mapping was performed by combining a
large scale identification of E2 partners by successive yeast two￾hybrid screenings and a cell-based interaction assay for the
validation of protein-protein interactions. This work gives an
overview of E2 biological functions across multiple HPV
genotypes, and provides a comprehensive framework for under￾standing the role of E2 in HPV pathologies.
Results/Discussion
Mapping of E2-Host Protein-Protein Interactions by Yeast
Two Hybrid Screenings
To provide a comprehensive assessment of E2-host Protein￾Protein Interactions (PPI), we mapped PPI of E2 from 12 HPV
genotypes representative of HPV tropism and pathogenic poten￾tial: mucosal HR-HPV 16, 18, 33 and 39; mucosal LR-HPV 6, 11
and 32; cutaneous HPV 1, 3, 5, 8 and 9. The 12 E2 proteins were
used as baits in a mating-based yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) to screen a
human keratinocyte (HaCaT) cDNA library. The number of
diploid yeasts generated was systematically evaluated to be at least
ten times higher than the library complexity. In order to obtain
exhaustive Y2H datasets, successive screenings were performed
with each of the E2 proteins.
In total, the Y2H screen identified 251 distinct interactions
involving 202 different cellular proteins. Few proteins were
interacting with numerous E2, indicating a low overlap of E2-
PPI in Y2H. Indeed, only 27 proteins (13.4%) were picked up with
more than one E2 protein as follows: 16 with two E2, seven with
three E2, and a single one with four, five, six or seven E2 proteins.
Five proteins (GPS2, SFRS1, AP3D1, C1QBP and TP53) had
been previously identified as E2 interacting proteins in the
literature (further referred to as Literature Curated E2-Protein
Protein Interactions or LCE2-PPI). LCE2-PPI were extracted
from the VirHostNet [13], virusMINT [14] and PubMed
databases (Table S1). For some of these interactors, PPI were
detected in our Y2H screen with an E2 protein of a different HPV
genotype than in LCE2-PPI (Table S2). These latter cases
probably point to shared E2-PPI, which could be verified through
their assessment with the series of 12 E2 proteins. The recovery of
5 out of 53 known E2 partners indicated a sensitivity of Y2H
screening around 10%, which is in the range of previously
described similar analyses [15]. This, combined with the high
coverage of the HaCaT cDNA library reached in each screening,
suggest a satisfactory sampling sensitivity. Overall, the Y2H screen
led to the identification of 197 new potential cellular binding
partners of at least one E2 protein.
Matrix Building for the Validation of E2-Host PPI
The Y2H screen applied to a wide spectrum of HPV genotypes
was appropriate to get an overview of E2-PPI without bias toward
the most studied E2 proteins, contrary to the LCE2-PPI datasets.
However, the coverage of PPI detected by Y2H is estimated to be
around 20% of total PPI [16], highlighting a high false-negative
rate inherent to this screening methodology [17]. We therefore
speculated that, despite repetitive probing of the HaCaT cDNA
library with each of the E2 protein, PPI detected with a subset of
E2 might have escaped detection with the others, which would
explain the low overlap of E2-PPI observed in the Y2H screens.
Moreover, it was previously demonstrated that combining
different methodologies is necessary to increase the robustness of
PPI datasets [18]. A stringent validation strategy consists in the use
of orthogonal PPI detection methods, as it ensures the discarding
of false positive interactions generated in Y2H screens.
We thus decided to challenge a subset of cellular proteins
selected from the Y2H screen for pair-wise interaction with the
whole set of the 12 E2 proteins using a mammalian cell-based
orthogonal PPI detection assay. Such a strategy allows a
comparative interaction analysis among the different HPV
genotypes. We used a secondary High-Throughput Gaussia princeps
luciferase-based Complementation Assay (HT-GPCA, Figure 1A)
recently described [19]. Briefly, bait and prey proteins were
expressed in 293T cells in fusion with two inactive fragments of the
Gaussia princeps luciferase (designated GL1 and GL2), which restore
a significant enzymatic activity when brought in close proximity by
an interaction. The reconstituted Luciferase activity is estimated
from a Normalized Luminescence Ratio (NLR, Figure 1A). This
assay has been recently benchmarked by using two positive
reference sets of protein pairs known to interact, and a set of a priori
non-interacting protein pairs [19]. It was determined that when
setting a NLR threshold of 3.5, there was only 30% false negatives
(known PPI not recovered in HT-GPCA) and 2.5% false positives.
A 3.5 NLR threshold was accordingly used to discriminate positive
interactions in the present study.
Author Summary
Over 100 types of human papillomaviruses are responsible
for widespread infections in humans. They cause a wide
range of pathologies, ranging from inapparent infections
to benign lesions, hyperplasia or cancers. Such heteroge￾neity results from variable interplay among viral and host
cell proteins. Aiming to identify specific features that
distinguish different pathological genotypes, we mapped
the virus-host interaction networks of the regulatory E2
proteins from a set of 12 genotypes representative of HPV
diversity. The E2-host interaction profiles recapitulate HPV
phylogeny, thus providing a valuable framework for
understanding the role of E2 in HPV infection of different
pathological traits. The E2 proteins tend to bind to highly
connected cellular proteins, indicating a profound effect
on the host cell. These interactions predominantly impact
on a subset of cellular processes, like transcriptional
regulation, apoptosis, RNA metabolism, ubiquitination or
intracellular transport. This work improves the global
understanding of HPV-associated pathologies, and pro￾vides a framework to select interactions that can be used
as targets for the development of new therapeutics.

A high-confidence core set of 48 potential E2 partners was
selected for validation from the Y2H dataset by keeping proteins
identified at least three times in Y2H [20]. Assuming that potential
false positives would be eliminated by combining two orthogonal
methods, 54 proteins found only one or two times were
additionally rescued for further validation in mammalian cells.
This non-core set consisted in proteins known from other studies
as E2 partners, proteins functionally relevant to E2 (transcription,
replication factors), or proteins related to potential E2 partners of
the core set. In total, 102 proteins were selected, corresponding to
138 distinct Y2H interactions obtained through 1,135 sequenced
PPI (Figure S1 and Table S3). We also increased the explored area
by including 19 known E2 partners, which were used as positive
controls herein referred as Gold Standards (GS). Combined with
the five known E2 partners recovered in our Y2H screen, the final
list of GS comprised 24 cellular proteins. In total, 121 cellular
proteins were to be validated for interaction with E2, of which 97
represented novel potential partners of E2.
Before proceeding to HT-GPCA, we wished to ensure that fusion
with a Gaussia fragment would not alter the folding and
functionality of E2 in the GL2-E2 fusion proteins. To that aim,
we assessed E2-dependent transcription of pTK6E2BS, containing
six E2 binding sites (E2BS) upstream of the minimal TK promoter.
The sequences of E2BS were designed to be optimal for the binding
of a large panel of E2 [21] in order to homogenize E2 binding to this
promoter. All GL2-E2 fusion proteins properly activated transcrip￾tion, demonstrating that the E2 proteins were functional (Figure 1B)
and thus that fusion of the GL2 tag at their N-terminus did not
induce incorrect folding or localization. The relative accumulation
of the E2 proteins was approximated by fusion with the Firefly
luciferase protein (Fluc-E2 fusion), so that their expression levels
could be deduced from luciferase activity as previously reported
[22]. Fluc-E2 fusion proteins accumulated to levels ranging from
5% (HPV32 E2) to 35% (HPV1 E2) of the Firefly luciferase alone,
indicating variations in E2 accumulation levels (Figure 1C).
However, there was no correlation between steady-state levels and
transcriptional activation (Figure 1B and 1C), pointing to differences
in the intrinsic transcriptional properties of the E2 proteins, thereby
corroborating previous studies [23,24]. As for the GL2-E2 fusion
proteins, the expression levels of the selected 121 cellular proteins
expressed as GL1 fusions may vary. The heterogeneity in protein
accumulation levels would potentially bring a degree of variability in
HT-GPCA assay, that have to be taken into consideration for the
comparative analysis of their interaction patterns.

assay is based on the reconstitution of a luciferase activity upon co-expression of interacting partners in fusion with two inactive fragments of the

Analysis of the Interactions between E2 Proteins and the
Gold Standards by HT-GPCA
To evaluate the reliability and sensitivity of the HT-GPCA
method applied to E2, we first conducted a pilot experiment with
the set of 24 gold standards (GS), which covered about half of
LCE2-PPI (Table S1). The results are displayed as Heat maps
where the intensity of an interaction, based on the NLR, is
represented by a color gradient from black (no interaction) to light
blue (strong interaction) (Figure 2A). As underscored in Figure 2,
the majority of E2-PPI in the GS set had been studied with a single
E2, mainly 16E2. Thus our approach significantly broadens the
scope of GS analysis.
Out of the 39 studied known E2 interactions (LCE2-PPI), 28
interactions (72%) were recovered by HT-GPCA (Figure 2A and
Table S4). For 7 of the 11 expected LCE2-PPI that failed to be
recovered, the corresponding gold standard protein interacted
with other E2 proteins, suggesting that the missing interactions
represent HT-GPCA false negative interactions. We noticed that
PPI with p53 (TP53) were detected in HT-GPCA with all the E2
proteins, in contrast to previous studies showing that this
interaction was restricted to mucosal HR-HPV E2 [8]. Such
discrepancies might be due to increased sensitivity of HT-GPCA,
and outline the need to combine different methods to improve the
confidence of interactions datasets.
A negative control interaction matrix provided a rough estimate
of the false-positive rate of PPI detected by HT-GPCA applied to
the E2 proteins. It consisted in cellular proteins randomly picked
in the human ORFeome resource, a priori not interacting with E2.
Among this matrix of 120 PPI (12E2610 proteins) the false
positive rate was 5.8% (Figure 2B).
Furthermore, the specificity of HT-GPCA was illustrated by
using E2 proteins invalidated for interaction with BRD4 by
mutation of Isoleucine 73 (HPV16) or 77 (HPV18) to Alanine
[25,26]. Both mutated proteins, 16E2 I73A and 18E2 I77A
exhibited an impaired binding to BRD4, with a five fold decrease
of NLR when compared to the wild-type proteins (Figure 2C).
Overall, these data demonstrate both the robustness and the
sensitivity of HT-GPCA to detect pair wise interactions involving
the E2 proteins.
Mapping of the 12 E2-Host Interaction Profiles by HT￾GPCA
We then processed all selected cellular proteins, performing
1,452 ( = 121612) tests. In total, 617 interactions (42%) exhibited a
NLR above 3.5, thereby scoring positive in HT-GPCA. Of the
121 cellular proteins tested, 23 (19%) did not engage detectable
interaction with any of the E2 proteins (Table S5). Of note,
virtually all of the 98 validated partners interacted with more than
one E2 protein, highlighting a high overlap between E2
interactors.
Comparison of the Y2H and HT-GPCA PPI datasets (schema￾tized in Figure S1) indicated that among the 138 interactions
detected in the Y2H screen (Y2H-PPI), 72 were validated in HT￾GPCA, representing 53 cellular proteins. 38 Y2H-PPI, involving

27 cellular proteins, were not recovered in HT-GPCA but
interactions were detected with different E2 proteins than in
Y2H. As discussed previously, we assume that the corresponding
non-recovered Y2H-PPI most probably represent HT-GPCA false
negative interactions. Lastly, 28 Y2H-PPI were not validated and
involved 22 cellular proteins that did not interact with any E2
proteins. These proteins were consequently discarded for further
analyses. Altogether, these results point a 53% overlap between
Y2H-PPI and HT-GPCA interactions. When considering the
interactors, the recovery was 79%.
PPI validation rate was higher with m- or b-types E2 proteins
(HPV1, 5, 8, 9) than with the a-types E2 (HPV 3, 6, 11, 16, 18, 32,
33 and 39), as reflected by brightness variations of the heat maps
(Figure 3A). Significantly, the overall NLR levels were not related
to E2 accumulation levels, since 9E2 exhibited the highest
interaction rate but was not the most accumulated. Conversely,
33E2 engaged the most interactions in the mucosal group, whereas
it accumulated at low levels (Figure 1C). These observations
clearly argue that variations in E2 accumulation levels are not
driving the differences observed by HT-GPCA, and therefore do

not essentially alter this comparative interaction mapping.
Differences in E2 interaction rates are more likely related to
intrinsic characteristics of the proteins. Notably, the m or b-E2
proteins contain the longest hinge regions (. 122 amino acid, ,79
for the others), which is an intrinsically disordered segment in E2
proteins. Their higher interaction rate is consistent with the notion
that disordered regions are enriched in exposed interaction motifs
[27].
The E2-host PPI profiles were gathered according to their
similarities by agglomerative hierarchical clustering (Cluster
software). Matrix tree plots were generated from this analysis,
and were used to build an E2-interaction dendrogram using the
UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic
Mean) method with the Euclidian distance function and a
complete linkage method (Figure 3B). Strikingly, in the interaction
dendrogram, the E2 proteins segregated according to HPV
tropism (cutaneous and mucosal), and further clustered following
pathogenic potential (high-risk versus low-risk). We found a high
correlation between the E2-interaction dendrogram and the
phylogenetic dendrogram based on the E2 sequences (Figure 3B),
the Pearson correlation coefficient calculated from the distance
matrices of the two dendrograms was 0.91, with a p-value ,
10210. Of note, using different parameters for the clustering
analysis did not drastically affect the structure of the interaction
dendrogram or the closeness to phylogenetic tree (Figure S2). This
observation demonstrates the robustness of the interaction
dendrogram generated by our approach.
The E2 protein is mainly envisioned as a basic viral factor,
essential for all HPV through its regulatory role of viral DNA
transcription, replication and mitotic segregation. Only few studies
demonstrated that E2 activities may differ according to HR or LR￾HPV type [8,9,27].
We show in the present study that the E2 proteins engage
different patterns of interaction with the host proteome depending
on both the tropism and the HR or LR trait of HPV. Such
interaction mapping may thus improve the understanding of cell
alterations induced by E2.
E2-PPI in Correlation with the HR Trait of HPV 16 and 18
The very first branching division in the E2-PPI dendrogram
separates the b/m from the a-types E2, which essentially
corresponds to a distinction between cutaneous (b/m-HPV) and
mucosal (a-HPV except for HPV3) HPV. Within each group, the
interaction profiles further clustered according to pathogenic
potential.
Now considering only the a group, we compared the interaction
profiles of E2 from the genital HR-HPV 16, 18, 33 and 39 with
those of the LR-HPV 6 and 11, in order to extract interactions
that may play a role for the life cycle of mucosal HR-HPV. Only
one protein, GPS2, which is an integral component of the NCoR
complex (Nuclear receptor Co-Repressor) [28] interacted with all
mucosal HR-HPV and not with the LR-HPV E2 proteins.
Focusing on the most prevalent HR-HPV16 and 18, we identified
a series of cellular proteins differentially bound by either 16E2 or
18E2 compared to the LR-HPV E2 proteins (table 1). Six of these
proteins were targeted by both 16E2 and 18E2 (GPS2, HSP5A,
ARFIP2, CDC20, SPTAN, VPS52), whereas the others were
genotype-specific. It is noteworthy that the above-mentioned
cellular partners interact with members of the m/b-types HPV E2
proteins, suggesting that they could also take part to HPV
pathogenesis in the context of cutaneous tropism. Of note, the
CDC20 protein was recovered among the HR-specific partners
interacting with both 16 and 18E2, in line with the proposed role
of this interaction in carcinogenic conversion associated with both
genotypes [9]. Given that the mucosal HR and LR viruses infect
distinct biological niches (HPV16/18 infect mucosal transforma￾tion zones, while HPV6/11 infect the external genitalia), such
discriminating interactions could result from the different
proteome of infected tissues. They nevertheless might point to
targets important for the life cycle of HPV16 or HPV18 genotypes,
responsible for most of the genital cancers.
Topological Analysis of the E2-Host Interaction Networks
Topological analysis of viral interaction networks can be
informative with regard to the global impact of viral proteins in
the host cell, as well as the dynamics of viral pathogenesis. To
conduct such analysis, we built E2-host interaction networks with
PPI scoring positive in HT-GPCA.
The degree of a protein reflects the number of interactions it
engages in the cell, and the degree distribution of a network gives a
measure of its local dynamics. We studied the degree distribution
of the E2-host network compared to that of a human interactome
reconstructed from Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD
2010 release 9), including 39,100 binary protein-protein interac￾tions. The cumulative plot of E2 and human interactomes relative
to protein degree (Figure 4A) shows that 75% of proteins of the
human interactome have a degree lower than eight (estimated
mean degree of the present human interactome), while for only
25% of E2 targets the degree is lower than eight. Such difference
was found statistically significant by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
(0.5 with a p-value , 0.002). These results indicated that E2
proteins preferentially bind to highly connected proteins, also
called hubs. The distribution of degree probability in both
interactomes further substantiates a clear overrepresentation of
high-degree proteins in the E2 interactome (Figure 4B). Overall,
these results show that E2 proteins preferentially target highly
connected cellular proteins. Such findings indicate that E2 broadly
impacts on host cells by interacting with key proteins involved in
many pathways of the cellular network. This likely maximizes E2
effects on a wide range of cellular functions. The preferential
targeting of central proteins was previously observed with other
viral proteins from EBV, KSHV and HCV [29–31]. Indeed, the

binding to hub proteins could be a general hallmark of viral
proteins to hijack at a systemic level the cellular interactome. It is
noteworthy that protein centrality has been correlated with the
presence of disordered regions [27]. We may therefore speculate
that the intrinsically disordered hinge region provides a platform
for most E2 interactions with the host proteome, as discussed
previously.
Functional Enrichment Analysis of the E2-Host
Interaction Networks
We next analyzed the E2 interaction network from a functional
point of view to get insights into the functions of E2 that could
emerge. Gathering of E2-targeted cellular proteins based on their
GO (Gene Ontology) terms with the DAVID bioinformatics base
[32] indicated enrichment of E2 targets in the following functional
families: regulation of transcription, regulation of apoptosis, RNA
processing, ubiquitination processes and intracellular transport
(Figure 5 and details of the DAVID analysis are given in the Figure
S3). This analysis gives an overview of E2 biological functions
across multiple HPV genotypes.
Transcription regulation. The most significant targeted
category consisted of proteins involved in transcriptional regula￾tion, corroborating the prominent role of E2 as a transcription
factor. It also highlights both the reliability of our approach and
the pertinence of the interaction datasets. This cluster is composed
of 26 proteins including transcription factors and cofactors,
activators and repressors (table 2 and table S6). Only seven
factors were bound by almost all E2 proteins (BRD4, TBP, MGA,
TP53, RSF, NMI and MYST2), and could be instrumental for E2
transcriptional activity. Non-shared partners would rather underlie
some specificity in intrinsic transcriptional properties of the E2
proteins. For example, our interaction data indicate that the
general transcription factor TFIIB (GTF2B) is only targeted by
16E2. This could account for the improved recruitment of basal
transcription components, which has been proposed for this viral
protein [23]. Of note, the equal proportion of E2-targeted factors
involved in activation and in repression of transcription likely
underlies a dual role of E2 in transcriptional regulation. It
highlights the importance of repression in the transcriptional
regulatory functions of E2. In line with this notion, a recent study
showed that the recruitment of multiple repressors by HPV18 E2
is required for full repression of early promoter transcription [33].
Interestingly, of the 34 cellular proteins that were found involved
in this repression, two (BRD4, HSPB1) have been detected as
direct E2 targets in the present study. Overall, the E2 interaction
mapping provides an experimental assessment of the complex
interplay between the E2 proteins and the host cell transcriptional
machinery.
Regulation of apoptosis. Multiple interactions between the
E2 proteins and death or survival signaling pathways could be
detected, through the targeting of 12 cellular proteins (table 2 and
table S7). This is a common trend of viral proteins, since
manipulations of cell death or survival pathways are key processes
during viral infections. Generally, apoptosis is prevented in early
phases of viral cycle to allow viral replication, and subsequent
apoptotic induction occurs along with the production of viral
particles [34]. The E2 proteins target both positive and negative
regulators of apoptosis, suggesting a complex regulation of cell
death pathways. Three apoptotic regulators were bound by all the
E2 proteins (TP53, CASP8, TAX1BP1). Interestingly, for two of
them, TP53 and CASP8, the binding of E2 may not have similar
functional consequences according to HPV genotype. Indeed,
apoptotic induction resulting from E2 binding to p53 was shown to
be specific to HR-HPV [8]. The binding of LR-HPV E2 proteins
to p53 detected here may either counteract p53 apoptotic
functions or affect other p53 activities. Similarly, E2 binding to
caspase 8 triggers apoptosis only for HR-HPV E2 proteins [35],
since it depends on the cytoplasmic accumulation of the E2
proteins, which is specific to HR-HPV [7].
RNA processing. This family comprised nine proteins, of
which six are involved in mRNA processing through the
spliceosome (table 2, table S8). The interaction with splicing
factors of the SR protein family was anticipated for b-types E2
proteins, through their hinge regions which contain long stretches
of SR repeats [36]. Our results provide evidence that the targeting
of SR-rich factors is conserved among all HPV genotypes. The a￾type E2 proteins show greatly reduced levels of interaction, in
accordance with the presence in their hinge of only short R￾alternating sequences (Figure S4). Our results nevertheless suggest
a conserved role of E2 in the regulation of RNA splicing. Of note,
several E2 proteins were found to interact with PCBP1, a protein
involved in the inhibition of translation of the late mRNA
encoding the L2 capsid protein [37].
Ubiquitination. E2 targets were enriched in proteins in￾volved in ubiquitination (table 2 and table S9). Some targets are
general factors of the Ubiquitin Proteasome System, as the
activating enzyme UBA1 or PSMA2 and POMP involved in
formation of the 26S proteasome, possibly affecting the global
process of proteasome-mediated protein degradation. Most E2
targets are, however, involved in the transfer of ubiquitin on
substrates. They include ubiquitin ligases of the HECT domain
family (HUWE1, WWP2), as well as substrate adaptors of Cullin￾based ubiquitin ligase complexes (BTBD1, SPOP, CDC20,
CDH1, FBX022). Given that E2 are ubiquitinated and degraded
by the proteasome [38–40], some of these interactions probably
mediate E2 degradation. Indeed, all E2 proteins were found to
bind an adaptor of CUL3-based ubiquitin complexes (SPOP or
BTBD1), in line with the involvement of these ligases in the
degradation of HPV16 E2 protein [39]. Alternatively, E2 binding
to Ub-ligases could have a functional impact by altering the
degradation of their natural targets. This was shown for the
binding of mucosal HR-HPVE2 to CDC20 and CDH1 (FZR1),
which leads to the stabilization of cyclin B by inhibiting the
‘‘Anaphase Promoting Complex’’ ubiquitin ligase [9].
Intracellular trafficking. Unexpectedly, intracellular trans￾port emerged from the HT-GPCA dataset as a functional family
targeted by E2 (table 2 and table S10). A high proportion of E2
targets are involved in vesicle-mediated transport, affecting
dynamics and maintenance of intracellular membranous organ￾elles (table 2). Only one protein, VPS52, involved in traffic
between the Golgi apparatus and endosomes, was bound by all the
E2 proteins. Conversely, most of the E2 proteins interacted with
several factors of this family. It highlights both a conserved and
extensive targeting of intracellular trafficking factors, probably
underlying novel E2 activities. This targeting is more concentrated
on the Golgi apparatus, with 7 factors affecting this organelle
(CLTA, SCYL1, VPS52, GGA1, KIF20A, NRBP1, RAB3IP).
The Golgi is central in the translocation of processed viral antigens
in association with type II MHC molecules. It might suggest that
through this targeting, the E2 proteins would alter antigen
presentation by infected keratinocytes. Surprisingly, E2 binds to
several proteins involved in HPV entry pathways such as clathrin
(CLTA), Rab-family proteins (RAB3IP), molecular motors
(KIF20A), endosomal/lysosomal trafficking factors (VPS39) [41].
From this overlap, it is tempting to speculate that E2 may have a
role in the early steps of infection. Only sparse information is
available regarding E2 involvement in virus infectivity. In the
BPV1 pseudovirion system, a study reported that E2 enhanced

encapsidation of full-length viral DNA and may be packaged within
the pseudovirion [42]. This was not corroborated by another study
where E2 expression was not found to alter BPV1 pseudovirions
production and infectivity [43]. The HPV pseudovirion system clearly
works without E2 while requiring L2 [43]. One hypothesis would be
that, in the context of a natural infection, the E2 protein is lying in the
virion and could affect the nuclear translocation of viral genome in
collaboration with L2. In conclusion, the functional targeting of
intracellular trafficking possibly uncovers a novel biological function of
E2, whose functional relevance requires further investigation.

Functional and Biological Validation of a Subset of E2
Targets
A subset of E2 cellular targets was selected in order to provide
further biological insight to some of the E2-host PPI identified
from the HT-GPCA dataset.
HR-specific E2-cellular targets. We selected interactions
that distinguished either HPV16 E2 or HPV18 E2 from other
mucosal E2 proteins, since they might increase the understanding
of the pathogenicity of these two viruses.
We first analyzed the impact of GTF2B on transcriptional
activity of 16E2 in comparison to 18E2. Indeed, GTF2B binding is
part of the PPI discriminating 16E2 from all the other tested
mucosal HPV, including 18E2. Coexpression of GTF2B increased
2.6-fold the transcriptional activation of E2-responsive promoter
by 16E2, while the effect on 18E2-mediated transactivation was
minor (1.7 fold, Figure 6A). Accordingly, siRNA-mediated
silencing of GTF2B impaired the activation of transcription by
16E2 but not by 18E2 (Figure 6B). These results substantiate both
the functional relevance and the specificity of 16E2/GTF2B
interaction.
Aiming to study a HR-specific PPI discriminating the 18E2
protein from all other mucosal E2, we chose VPS39, which plays a
role in clustering and fusion of late endosomes and lysosomes.
Both proteins were coexpressed in HaCaT keratinocytes fused to
fluorescent tags, GFP (E2) and monomeric cherry (VPS39). As
shown in figure 6C, VPS39 when expressed alone, exhibited a
cytoplasmic distribution pattern in vesicles, in line with its
association with lysosomes [44]. Coexpression with GFP-18E2
increased mcherry-VPS39 vesicles density, reminiscent of lyso￾somal clustering [44]. VPS39 vesicles were all labelled with GFP
indicating a colocalization of 18E2 in these vesicles (Figure 6C). In
contrast, 16E2 did not affect the density of VPS39 vesicle, despite
some degree of colocalization. These results show that the specific
interaction between 18E2 and VPS39 results in the clustering of
VPS39 vesicles.
Targeting of intracellular trafficking factors. Given that
E2 is primarily a nuclear transcription/replication factor, the
targeting of cellular proteins involved in intracellular trafficking
was a surprising aspect of our results. We therefore wished to
visualize a subset of identified interactions using the colocalization
assay previously described. Since it was the strongest interaction
detected with 16E2 in this family, we first focused on the cellular
protein VPS52 (Vacuolar Protein Sorting 52), a protein involved
in vesicle trafficking from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network.
Ectopically expressed VPS52 distributed in vesicles as described
[45] (Figure 7A). When co-expressed with 16, 18 or 39 E2, a
colocalization of VPS52 and E2 proteins could be observed
(Figure 7A). In addition, VPS52 vesicles concentrated in a
perinuclear region specifically in the presence of 16E2, which in
turn massively redistributed in these vesicles. These observations
are in good agreement with the HT-GPCA interaction data where
16E2/VPS52 NLR is the highest (table S10).
A similar redistribution was detected for 9E2 when co-expressed
with VPS39 (figure 7B), in line with the VPS39 NLR profile in HT￾GPCA. As shown in Figure 6C, VPS39 also interacts with 18E2.
Interestingly, the impact of 18E2 and 9E2 expression on the pattern
of VPS39 distribution varied, since vesicles clustering could only be
observed in the presence of 18E2 (compare Figures 6C and 7B). The
functional consequences of shared interactions may thus vary
according to HPV genotypes, especially for the cutaneous and
mucosal HPV which rely on more divergent pathogenesis.
Likewise, the interaction of clathrin light chain (CLTA) with 9
and 18E2 proteins, evidenced by colocalization, led to an
increased nuclear accumulation of CLTA and induced different
nuclear patterns (Figure 7C). No colocalization could be observed
with 5 or 16 E2, in line with the HT-GPCA profiles.

Comparative Interactomics of HPV E2 Proteins

We lastly studied KIF20A, a protein involved in the transport of
Golgi membranes and associated vesicles along microtubules, and
shown to localize both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm where it
can adopt a filamentous distribution [46]. Co-expression of
KIF20A with a panel of E2 proteins confirmed the HT-GPCA
results since all the E2 proteins interacting with KIF20A showed
colocalization patterns (Figure 7D). When co-expressed with
HPV5 E2, KIF20A strictly accumulated in 5E2-containing
nuclear dots, while for other E2 proteins, in particular 18E2 and
33E2, colocalization could be observed both in the nucleus and
cytoplasmic filaments.
Overall, the colocalization studies substantiate the targeting by
E2 of proteins involved in cellular trafficking processes. In
addition, they uncover differential effects of E2 binding on the
distribution of targeted factors. This suggests that the E2 proteins
may have various impacts on the intracellular trafficking, whose
biological significance will clearly require further investigation.
Our comparative interactomics approach provides an unbiased
mapping of E2-host protein-protein interactions and offers a
unique opportunity to assess E2-host PPI profiles in relation to
HPV tropism and pathogenic potential. The correlation between
E2 interaction dendrograms and HPV phylogeny clearly demon￾strates the reliability of the screening strategy, and suggests that E2
engages differential patterns of interaction. Accordingly, some
interactions are discriminating the E2 proteins of HR-HPV from
LR-HPV in the genital context. The targeting of cellular hubs
accounts for a broad impact of E2 on the host cells. Analysis of E2-
host PPI networks provides an overview of E2 biological functions
across multiple HPV genotypes. It corroborates the essential role
of E2 in the control of gene expression through regulation of
transcription, which emerges as the prime target of the E2
proteins, and also through the regulation of RNA processing. In
addition, the E2 proteins turn out to affect cell physiology through
the targeting of apoptosis, ubiquination and intracellular traffick￾ing. A striking feature of our results is the targeting of both positive
and negative regulators of the same cell processes, suggesting dual
roles of the E2 proteins. Further biological validations of a subset
of identified PPI support interaction data, and provide evidence of
a diversified functional impact of the E2 proteins on cellular
processes. Overall, this study constitutes a framework for future
functional investigations on E2 proteins and provides a solid basis
to understand the role of E2 in HPV pathogenesis.
Materials and Methods
Plasmids
The 12 ORF encoding for the E2 proteins were amplified from
viral genomic DNA corresponding to the different HPV
genotypes, cloned by the gateway recombinational cloning system
(Invitrogen) into the entry vector pDON207 (Invitrogen), and were
listed in the ViralORFeome database [47]. The E2 ORFs were
then transferred into gateway-compatible destination vectors

pGBKT7-gw to generate E2-GAL4 DNA-binding domain fusion
proteins for Y2H; pCI-Neo-FLuc-gw to generate Firefly luciferase￾E2 fusions proteins for steady state levels measurement; pSPICA￾N2-gw to generate proteins with amino acids 110 to 185 of the
humanized Gaussia princeps luciferase in fusion with the N-terminus
of E2 (GL2-E2 fusion proteins) for the High-Throughput Gaussia
princeps Luciferase-based Complementation Assay (see [19] for
construct details). Entry gateway plasmids for cellular partners
were obtained either by PCR amplification from clones recovered
by Y2H or from the human ORFeome resource (hORFeome
v3.1). The cellular ORF were transferred into gateway-compatible
destination vectors pSPICA-N1-gw to generate proteins fused at
the N-terminus with the amino acids 18 to 109 of humanized
Gaussia luciferase (GL1-fusion proteins). Mutagenesis of E2
proteins from HPV 16 and 18 was performed by PCR-directed
mutagenesis method. The luciferase reporter (pTK6E2BS) driven
by E2-responsive promoter contained 6 E2 binding sites upstream
the minimal TK promoter. E2 BS sequences were as follows:
(aACCGTTTTCGGTtaaACCGTTTTCGGTt)X3, designed af￾ter the study of Sanchez et al [21] to be optimal for the binding of
a large panel of E2 proteins. The polymerase III-directed Renilla
Luciferase plasmid (polIII-Ren) used as an internal control of
transfection contained a 100-mer nucleotide encompassing the
human Histone H1 promoter upstream of the Renilla ORF
(hRluc).
Yeast Two Hybrid
For yeast two hybrid screening, GAL4 DNA-binding domain￾E2 fusion proteins, expressed from the pGBKT7 vector, were used
to probe a human HaCaT cDNA library (Clontech), cloned in
fusion with the GAL4 transcription activation domain in pACT2.
Each independent screening was performed by mating pGBKT7-
E2 transformed yeast strain AH109 (MATa, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112,
ura3-52, his3-200, gal4D, gal80D, LYS2 : : GAL1UASGAL1TATA￾HIS3, GAL2UAS-GAL2TATA-ADE2, URA3 : : MEL1UAS-MEL1-
TATA-lacZ) with Y187 strain (MATa, ura3-52, his3-200, ade2-101,
trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, gal4D, met–, gal80D, URA3 : : GAL1UAS￾GAL1TATA-lacZ) transformed with the HaCaT cDNA library.
Mating was performed 4 hr at 30uC on plates of non-selective rich
YCM media. The number of diploid cells generated was
systematically evaluated to be at least 10 times higher the HaCaT
cDNA library complexity (2.56106
, Clontech).
Mated yeasts were grown on selective medium lacking
tryptophan, leucine and histidine (SD-W-L-H), and supplemented
with 3-aminotriazol according to the basal autoactivation test
previously performed (see below). HaCaT cDNA sequences from
positive colonies were PCR amplified and sequenced. Independent
Y2H screens were repeated in the same way for each of the E2
protein until around 100 PPI could have been sequenced.
Yeast Two-Hybrid Bait Basal Transactivation Test
Because bait constructs sometimes self-transactivate reporter
genes, SD-W-L-H culture medium was supplemented with 3-
aminotriazole (3-AT) in the Y2H screenings. Appropriate
concentrations of this inhibitor were determined by growing bait
strains (AH109 yeast strain transformed with each E2 bait) on SD￾W-H culture medium supplemented with increasing concentra￾tions of 3-AT. Concentrations of 3-AT ranging from 5 mM (for
33, 39, 18, 11, 5 and 8 E2) to 10 mM (for 1, 3, 6, 9, 32 and 16E2)
were sufficient to counter the weak transactivation observed. This
falls into the range of Clonetech standards.
Analysis of Sequenced Y2H PPI (Interactor Sequence Tag
or IST)
A bioinformatic pipeline was developed to assign each IST to its
native human genome transcript. First, ISTs were filtered by using
Figure 6. Validation of HR-specific interactions. (A) HeLa cells were transfected by pTK6E2BS-Luc reporter and HPV16 or HPV18 E2 expression

High-Throughput Gaussia princeps Luciferase-Based

HEK-293T cells were seeded at 35,000 cells per well in 96-well
plates. After 24 h, cells were transfected by linear PEI (poly￾ethylenimine) with pSPICA-N2-E2 and pSPICA-N1-cellular
protein constructs (100 ng each), for expression of the GL2-E2
and GL1-fusion proteins, where GL1 and GL2 are two inactive
fragments of the Gaussia princeps luciferase. 10 ng of a CMV-firefly
luciferase reporter plasmid was added to normalize for transfection
efficiency. Cells were lysed 24 h post-transfection in 40 mL of
Renilla luciferase lysis buffer (Promega) for 30 minutes. The
Gaussia princeps luciferase activity was measured on 30 mL of total
cell lysate by a luminometer Berthold Centro XS LB960 after
injection of 100 mL of the Renilla luciferase substrate (Promega).
Firefly luciferase was measured on the remaining 10 ml lysate with
Firefly luciferase substrate. Gaussia Luciferase activity was
reported to Firefly luciferase activity for each sample, giving a
normalized Gaussia luminescence. Each normalized Gaussia
luciferase activity was calculated from the mean of triplicate
samples. For a given pair of proteins (A and B), the normalized
Gaussia luminescence of cells coexpressing GL1-A+GL2-B pro￾teins was divided by the sum of normalized Gaussia luminescence
of each partner coexpressed with matched empty plasmid: GL1-

Normalized Luminescence Ratio (NLR) corresponding to the
reconstituted Gaussia luciferase activity, thus reflecting the level of
interaction between protein pairs. See [19] for further details on
the method.
Analyses
Literature curated interaction (LCI) involving the E2 proteins
were extracted from the VirHostNet [13], virusMINT [14] and
PubMed databases. Interaction data analyses were performed
using the R statistics package. Raw NLR interaction data were
separated into categories in order to minimize the dispersion of
NLR values. Cut-off thresholds of each category were determined
with the goal of maintaining the same frequency distribution
across all categories. An Euclidian distance matrix was calculated
from the data categories using the ‘‘dist’’ function from R. The
interaction dendrogram was calculated using the ‘‘complete’’
(UPGMA) linkage method from the ‘‘hclust’’ function from R. E2
protein sequences were clustered using the ‘‘phylip’’ package [48].
Protein distances were calculated with the ‘‘prodist’’ program,
using default parameters. The phylogenetic dendrogram was
generated with the ‘‘neighbor’’ program using the UPGMA
method and default parameters. Both interaction and phylogenetic
dendrograms were generated using JavaTreeView [49]. A Pearson
correlation coefficient was calculated with the ‘‘cor’’ function in R
using the cophenetic distances between both interaction and
phylogenetic dendrogram to determine the closeness of the two
dendrograms, The label order for the intensity data was then
randomly changed to generate 100,000 random dendrograms.
The cophenetic distance matrix for these randomized dendro￾grams was compared to the cophenetic distance matrix from the
phylogenetic dendrogram with a Pearson correlation (‘‘cor’’)
function from R. The p-value was calculated based on the
number of standard deviations the correlation between the
interaction dendrogram and the phylogenetic dendrogram was
from the mean of the distribution of the correlation between the
random and the phylogenetic dendrogram. A Cumulative Density
Function of the randomized dataset was compared to a normal
distribution generated by the R function ‘rnorm’ using the same
mean and standard deviation from the randomized dataset to
check the normality of the data.
The E2 interaction networks were generated with the cytoscape
software [50] with interactions scoring positive in HT-GPCA
(NLR above 3.5). The degree of each cellular protein in both E2
and HPRD-based human interactomes was extracted from
cytoscape. To determine the overrepresented GO (Gene Ontol￾ogy) terms in the interaction dataset and to evaluate the gathering
of E2 targets by functional categories, we used the DAVID
bioinformatic database [32]. P-values were generated by DAVID.
Transactivation Assay
293T cells were plated at 35,000 cells per well in 96-well plates
and transfected 24 h later by linear PEI with 25 ng of pTK6E2BS
E2 responsive reporter plasmid, 10 ng of the polIII-Ren as
internal control for transfection efficiency, and 100 ng of GL2-E2
fusion proteins or empty GL2 plasmid. To assess the effect of
GTF2B, HeLa cells plated in 12-well plates were transfected by
linear PEI with 100 ng of pTK6E2BS, 10 ng polIII-Ren, 100 ng
of mCherry-fused E2 or mCherry expressing plasmids, and either
1 mg of GTF2B expressed from pCI Neo or of empty pCI Neo
(Promega). 30 h post transfection, cells were lysed in Passive lysis
buffer according to manufacturer’s instructions and luciferase
activity was measured with Dual Glo Buffer (Promega). Results are
given as the mean of three independent tests 6 SD (errors bars).
Fluorescence Assay
HaCaT cells grown in coverslip were co-transfected by linear
PEI with expression plasmids for GFP-fused E2 proteins (3 mg) and
Cherry-fused cellular proteins (1 mg). 24 h post transfection, cells
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, washed in PBS,
and incubated with DAPI for 30 min. Cells were mounted with
CitiFluor. Fluorescent Images were acquired using a ZEISS
Apotome microscope.
siRNA Assay
7,500 HeLa cells were reverse transfected by INTERFERin
(Polyplus-Transfection) with 1.75 picomole of a pool of four
siRNA targeting GTF2B (from Qiagen bank Human Whole
Genome siRNA Set V4.1), and plated in 96-well plates. 2
scrambled siRNA (ref 1027310, Qiagen) were used as negative
controls. 48 h later, 20 ng of Cherry-E2 expression plasmids were
transfected by linear PEI along with the 25 ng of pTK6E2BS
reporter and 10 ng of polIII-Ren as internal control for
transfection efficacy and cell viability. 24 h post transfection, cells
were lysed in passive lysis buffer according to manufacturer’s
instructions (Promega). Firefly and Renilla luciferase were
measured on a Berthold Centro luminometer to generate a
Luciferase/Renilla ratio, each transfection was tested in triplicates
with each bar representing the mean 6 SD. Results are given as
fold activation of TKE2BS by E2 in the presence of the siRNA,
calculated relative to TKE2BS activity without E2. P-values were
calculated by a Student statistical test.
