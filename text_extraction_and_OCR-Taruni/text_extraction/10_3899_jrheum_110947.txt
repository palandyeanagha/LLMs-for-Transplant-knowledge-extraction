ABSTRACT. Objective. To describe clinical fracture rates, back pain, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in
postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who are receiving glucocorticoids (GC), during a 36-month
study of teriparatide treatment for up to 18 months, with an additional 18-month followup period when
patients were receiving other osteoporosis medications.
Methods. A prospective, multinational, observational study. Data for clinical fractures, back pain (by
visual analog scale; VAS) and HRQOL (by EQ-5D) were collected over 36 months. Fracture data were
summarized in 6-month segments and analyzed using logistic regression with repeated measures.
Changes from baseline in back pain VAS and EQ-VAS were analyzed.
Results. Of 1581 enrolled women with followup data, 294 (18.6%) had antecedents of GC use. Of
these, 49 (16.7%) patients sustained a total of 69 fractures during the 36-month study period. Adjusted
odds of fracture were significantly decreased during the last year of followup compared with the first 6
months of teriparatide treatment: an 81% decrease in the 24 to < 30-month period (p < 0.05), and an
89% decrease in the 30 to < 36-month period (p < 0.05). There were significant reductions in back pain
and improvements in HRQOL in both groups of GC users and nonusers.
Conclusion. Postmenopausal women with severe osteoporosis receiving GC, who were treated with
teriparatide for up to 18 months, showed a reduced incidence of clinical fractures during the third year
while receiving sequential osteoporosis treatments compared with the first 6 months, together with
reduced back pain and improved HRQOL. Our results should be interpreted in the context of an uncon￾trolled observational study in a routine clinical setting. (First Release Jan 15 2012; J Rheumatol

Glucocorticoids (GC) are potent antiinflammatory and
immunosuppressive agents widely used for the treatment of
diseases including chronic lung disease, rheumatoid arthritis
(RA) and other connective tissue diseases, and inflammatory
bowel disease and after transplantation. GC use, however, is
associated with adverse effects including rapid bone loss lead￾ing to osteoporosis and an increased risk of fracture1.
Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIO) is the most com￾mon cause of secondary osteoporosis and fractures, which
may occur in 30% to 50% of patients receiving chronic GC
therapy1. The mechanisms underlying GC-induced deteriora￾tion of bone quality differ from those in postmenopausal
osteoporosis, and affect predominantly osteoblasts and
decreased bone formation2,3. The negative effect of GC on
bone quality is also reflected by the higher risk of fractures in
GC users than nonusers with a similar level of bone mineral
density (BMD)4, indicating that the increase in fracture risk in
GC users is at least partly independent of BMD.
Teriparatide [recombinant human parathyroid hormone
(1-34)] is a bone anabolic agent approved for the treatment of
postmenopausal women and men with severe osteoporosis
who are at high risk of fracture. Evidence from a randomized,
double-dummy, active-controlled trial showed that teri￾paratide treatment of men and women with GIO resulted in

greater gains in lumbar spine BMD and fewer new vertebral
fractures, compared with alendronate therapy, after 18 and 36
months of treatment5,6. Although randomized controlled trials
(RCT) are considered the “gold standard” for evaluating drug
efficacy, the design of such studies limits the generalizability
of their findings to everyday clinical practice7. Therefore, the
conclusions of RCT can be complemented by observational
studies, because their findings may have wider applicability to
the patient population treated in regular clinical practice.
The effectiveness of teriparatide in regular clinical practice
has been evaluated in the European Forsteo Observational
Study (EFOS), a 36-month prospective observational study in
the outpatient setting, designed to evaluate fracture outcomes,
back pain, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in post￾menopausal women with severe osteoporosis8. The aim of our
predefined analysis was to describe the baseline characteris￾tics, fracture outcomes, back pain, and HRQOL in the sub￾group of EFOS patients who were concomitantly treated with
GC at any time during the study (i.e., at baseline or at any time
during the 36-month followup). We describe these outcomes
both during active treatment with teriparatide for up to 18
months and in the subsequent 18-month followup period after
teriparatide was discontinued, when most patients were
receiving other osteoporosis medications.
The changes in clinical fracture risk, back pain, and
HRQOL during the up to 18-month teriparatide treatment
period and the 18-month followup period for the total study
cohort have been reported previously9,10.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients. Postmenopausal women with a diagnosis of osteoporosis who were
about to initiate teriparatide treatment according to the clinical judgment and
usual practice of the participating physicians were enrolled in EFOS, a mul￾ticenter, prospective, observational study conducted in 8 European countries
(Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, The Netherlands, and
Sweden). Participating physicians specialized in the treatment of osteoporo￾sis and its complications. Teriparatide treatment (20 µg once daily by
self-administered subcutaneous injection; Forsteo, Eli Lilly, Windlesham,
UK) was initiated at the baseline visit. Patients were followed for the duration
of their teriparatide treatment, which they could discontinue at any time, with
followup visits at 3, 6, 12, and up to 18 months after initiation of teriparatide.
Patients were asked to return for 2 additional visits at about 6 and 18 months
after discontinuing teriparatide treatment.
Patients were excluded from the study if they were currently being treat￾ed with an investigational drug or procedure, or had any contraindications as
described in the teriparatide product label11. There were no further restrictions
regarding patient selection. All study participants provided written informed
consent prior to enrollment and were able to withdraw at any time without any
consequences in their medical attention. The study was approved by local
ethics committees or review boards, depending on local requirements, and
was conducted from April 2004 (first patient enrolled) until February 2009
(last patient completed) in accord with the ethical standards of the Declaration
of Helsinki. The study design and characteristics of the EFOS patient popula￾tion have been described in detail8.
Assessments. Patient demographic characteristics, risk factors for osteoporo￾sis and falls, drugs related to the risk of osteoporosis (including GC), and dis￾ease status were recorded at the baseline visit8. The number and type of pre￾vious and current medications for the treatment of osteoporosis were record￾ed. Diagnosis of osteoporosis was based upon axial or peripheral dual x-ray
absorptiometry measurements of BMD and was confirmed following review
of medical reports by the treating physician. Incident clinical vertebral and
nonvertebral fragility fractures during the observational period were diag￾nosed and confirmed by review of the original radiographs and/or the radiol￾ogy or surgical reports at the investigational site. A new or worsened clinical
vertebral fracture was defined as the presence of a confirmed radiographic
vertebral fracture associated with signs and/or symptoms suggestive of verte￾bral fracture(s)12.
Back pain was self-assessed by patients at each study visit using a
100-mm visual analog scale (VAS), ranging from 0 = no back pain to 100 =
worst possible back pain. Patients also completed a back pain questionnaire
that recorded the frequency and severity of back pain, limitations of activities,
and days in bed due to back pain in the previous month9.
HRQOL was measured at each visit using the European Quality of Life
Questionnaire (EQ-5D)13, where patients assess their perceived overall health
status on a VAS (EQ-VAS) that ranges from 0 (worst imaginable health state)
to 100 (best imaginable health state), and classify their own health status
according to 5 dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities,
pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), each of which is scored on a
3-point scale (no problems, some problems, or extreme problems). The
Health State Value (HSV) was calculated from the 5 EQ-5D dimensions using
the UK scoring algorithm to allow comparisons among countries14.
Statistical analysis. For data analyses, the total study cohort included all
patients with a baseline visit and at least 1 followup visit. The post-teri￾paratide cohort included those patients who discontinued teriparatide at any
time between baseline and 18 months and had at least 1 post-teriparatide fol￾lowup visit. Patients were categorized as being GC users or nonusers. Patients
in the GC user group were those who were taking GC at the baseline visit or
at any time during the study.
Descriptive statistics, such as frequencies, percentages, means, SD, and
ranges, were used to describe the GC user and nonuser groups.
Between-group comparisons were made using chi-square or Fisher’s exact
tests (categorical variables) or the Kruskal-Wallis test (continuous variables).
The number of fractures occurring in GC users and nonusers was sum￾marized in 6-month periods. For each group, a logistic regression with repeat￾ed measures was used to assess the change in number of patients with 1 or
more fractures over time15,16, giving an analysis of the odds of 1 or more frac￾tures. Patients were included in the model at all observed periods, regardless
of whether they had experienced a fracture during a previous period. The
repeated observations of each patient were assumed to be related, but no fur￾ther assumptions were made about the relationship. Unadjusted and adjusted
analyses were performed that included age, prior bisphosphonate use, and
fracture in the last 12 months before starting teriparatide. Contrasts were
made between the odds of fracture in the first 6 months of treatment (0 to < 6
months) and each subsequent 6-month interval.
Back pain and HRQOL were summarized over the teriparatide treatment
period and after teriparatide discontinuation for the GC user and nonuser
groups. Changes in back pain VAS from baseline were analyzed using a
mixed model of repeated measures (MMRM), adjusting for back pain VAS
at baseline, number of previous fractures, age, diagnosis of RA, duration of
previous bisphosphonate therapy, and history of fracture in the 12 months
before entering the study. Variables analyzed using the sign test were the
number of patients reporting an improvement, no change, or worsening from
baseline in the severity of back pain, frequency of back pain, and limitation
of activities due to back pain. The median change from baseline in the num￾ber of days in bed due to back pain was analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed￾rank test.
A similar MMRM was used to assess the change from baseline in
EQ-VAS, including its baseline value. The number of patients reporting an
improvement, no change, or worsening from baseline in each of the 5 EQ-5D
domains was analyzed using the sign test. Changes from baseline in EQ-5D
HSV were assessed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test because this param￾eter has a nonparametric distribution.

RESULTS
Patient disposition and characteristics. A total of 1649 post￾menopausal women were enrolled in EFOS, and 1581 had a
baseline visit and at least 1 postbaseline visit (the total study
cohort). Of these 1581 patients, 294 (18.6%) were GC users
and 1287 (81.4%) were GC nonusers. Figure 1 shows the
patient disposition over the course of the study for GC user
and nonuser groups.
The demographic and baseline characteristics of the GC
users and nonusers are summarized in Table 1. Compared with
the GC nonuser group, the GC user group was younger, had a
higher frequency of surgical menopause, a higher lumbar
spine BMD T score, a higher frequency of previous bisphos￾phonate use, and more frequent need to use their arms when
standing up from a chair (Table 1). In addition, a significantly
higher percentage of patients in the GC user group had RA,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or chronic hepatopa￾thy, and were taking concomitant chronic medications such as
antihypertensives, benzodiazepines, antiarrhythmics and anti￾depressants (Table 1). At baseline, the GC user group had a
lower HRQOL as indicated in a significantly lower mean EQ￾VAS and median EQ-HSV compared with the GC nonuser
group (Table 1).
Teriparatide treatment and osteoporosis medications after
teriparatide treatment. The median duration of teriparatide
treatment was similar in the GC user and nonuser groups: 545
days (Q1, Q3: 503, 554) and 542 days (Q1, Q3: 520, 555),
respectively. Persistent use of calcium and vitamin D through￾out teriparatide treatment was reported by 74.7% of the GC
users and 68.2% of GC nonusers.
After teriparatide was discontinued, there were 156 GC
users and 753 GC nonusers in the post-teriparatide cohort.
The majority of GC users took osteoporosis medication after
teriparatide (n = 149, 95.5%): 109 (69.9%) took any antire￾sorptives, mainly bisphosphonates (n = 96, 61.5%). Other
antiresorptives were used much less frequently after teri￾paratide was discontinued and included estrogens or ralox￾ifene (8.3%) and calcitonin (5.1%). Calcium and vitamin D
were widely used after teriparatide was stopped in the GC
users (89.7% and 87.8% of patients, respectively). Similarly,
706 (94.0%) of the GC nonusers took osteoporosis medication
after teriparatide: 532 (70.8%) took any antiresorptives, main￾ly bisphosphonates (n = 478, 63.6%). The use of other antire￾sorptives and of calcium and vitamin D was similar to the GC
users group.
Fracture outcomes. The incidence of fractures during teri￾paratide treatment (0 to < 18 months) and after teriparatide
was discontinued (18 to < 36 months, when most patients
were receiving other osteoporosis medications) in the GC user

and nonuser groups is shown in Table 2. In the GC user group,
49 (16.7%) women sustained 1 or more fractures during the
36-month study period. Of the 69 fractures, 21 (30.4%) were
vertebral, and 48 (69.6%) were nonvertebral: 38 (55.1%) of
all fractures were main nonvertebral fractures at the humerus
(n = 12), leg (n = 9), hip (n = 8), forearm/wrist (n = 7), and
sternum/ribs (n = 2). Table 2 shows a significant decrease in
the adjusted odds of fracture in the last 2 time periods com￾pared with the first 6 months of teriparatide treatment (0 to <
6 months), i.e., the decrease was 81% in the 24 to < 30-month
period and 89% in the 30 to < 36-month period after teri￾paratide had been discontinued.
To determine whether changes in GC use during followup
may have influenced the incidence of fractures, we performed
a posthoc analysis repeating the logistic regression model but
adding current GC use during each 6-month period as a time￾varying covariate. As for the predefined analysis, the adjusted
odds of fracture were significantly decreased (compared with
the first 6-month period) during the last year of followup, i.e.,
there was an 88% decrease in the 24 to < 36-month period 
(p = 0.003) and a 94% decrease in the 30 to 36-month period
(p = 0.004).
In the GC nonuser group, 159 (12.4%) women sustained 1
or more fractures during the study. Of the 189 fractures, 66
(34.9%) were vertebral and 123 (65.1%) were nonvertebral;
91 (48.1%) of all fractures were main nonvertebral fractures at
the forearm/wrist (n = 34), hip (n = 19), sternum/ribs (n = 17),
leg (n = 12), and humerus (n = 9). Table 2 shows a significant
decrease in the adjusted odds of fracture for GC nonusers at
every time period, compared with the first 6 months of teri￾paratide treatment (0 to < 6 months).
The adjusted odds of fracture were significantly higher in

Table 3 summarizes the incidence of clinical fractures after
teriparatide discontinuation in the GC users and nonusers (the

the clinical fracture rates during the last 12 months of fol￾lowup for GC users only.
A posthoc analysis repeating the logistic regression model
but adding current GC use during each 6-month period as a
time-varying covariate in the GC user group gave results sim￾ilar to those in Table 3. Compared with the first 6 months after
teriparatide was discontinued (0 to < 6 months), there was a
significant decrease in the adjusted odds of fracture at 6 to <

back pain during teriparatide treatment in both the GC user
and nonuser groups (Table 4). These changes were maintained
after teriparatide was discontinued. The only differences seen
between the GC user and nonuser groups were a greater

back pain after teriparatide was discontinued in the GC
nonuser group (Table 4).

EQ-VAS was significantly higher in the GC nonuser group
than in the GC user group at the 12-month visit only. Results
similar to those in Figure 3 were obtained when the model was
repeated including GC use as a time-varying covariate (data
not shown). The percentage of GC users and nonusers report￾ing some/extreme problems for each of the 5 EQ-5D domains
is summarized in Table 5. There were significant improve￾ments from baseline (p < 0.001, sign test) in all 5 domains
during teriparatide treatment that were maintained after teri￾paratide was discontinued.
In the GC user group, median (Q1, Q3) HSV values were
significantly increased (p < 0.001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test)
from baseline at all postbaseline visits and were 0.689 (0.516,
0.796) at 18 months and 0.691 (0.516, 0.812) at 36 months.
The same was seen in the GC nonuser group, where the medi￾an (Q1, Q3) HSV values were 0.725 (0.620, 0.848) and 0.760
(0.587, 1.000) at 18 and 36 months, respectively.
DISCUSSION
The results of this subgroup analysis of the EFOS study
showed that postmenopausal women with severe osteoporosis
receiving GC, who were treated with teriparatide for up to 18
months in a routine clinical setting, had a reduced incidence of
clinical fractures during the third year of observation, when
the majority of them received subsequent treatment with cal￾cium, vitamin D, and antiresorptive drugs. This finding was
accompanied by reduced back pain and improved HRQOL
during teriparatide treatment that was maintained after the
drug was discontinued. The clinical characteristics of the
patients enrolled in the EFOS study show that both groups of
GC users and nonusers who were treated with teriparatide had

Model includes baseline back pain VAS score, number of previous frac￾tures, fracture in 12 months before study entry, age, duration of previous bisphosphonate use, and diagnosis of rheumatoid arthri￾tis. The unadjusted mean back pain VAS scores at baseline, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months and end of study (last observation
carried forward) for the GC users were 58.4 (SD 27.4), 42.5 (SD 25.4), 37.9 (SD 25.9), 35.3 (SD 26.4), 32.8 (SD 26.1), 32.9 (SD
28.1), 31.3 (SD 27.6), and 36.9 (SD 28.8), respectively. For the GC nonuser group, the corresponding unadjusted mean scores
were 57.6 (SD 26.4), 43.0 (SD 24.9), 38.4 (SD 25.3), 34.5 (SD 25.5), 31.7 (SD 25.4), 31.9 (SD 26.4), 28.8 (SD 26.0), and 32.7
(SD 26.9). Between-group difference for the unadjusted scores was significant only for end of study (p = 0.02, 2-sample t test).
The unadjusted mean change from baseline to endpoint for the GC users and nonusers was –22.0 (SD 34.9) and –24.8 (SD 31.2),
respectively. All values p < 0.001 versus baseline. SE: standard error.

severe osteoporosis, a highly impaired HRQOL, and were at
very high risk of further fractures as indicated by their risk
profiles at baseline. A high proportion of patients in both
groups had previously used bisphosphonates, which was
expected because bisphosphonates are routinely used as first￾line treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis. Although we
did not collect the reasons for initiating teriparatide in our
study, most of the treatment guidelines in the participating
countries indicate that teriparatide can be used as a second￾line treatment for severely osteoporotic patients who do toler￾ate or have contraindications to other osteoporosis medica￾tions, or who have sustained new fractures while taking other
osteoporosis medications. However, in some countries teri￾paratide can be used as first-line therapy in patients with
severe osteoporosis.
We performed a subgroup analysis based on GC use
because it has been well established that treatment with GC
significantly increases the risk for fragility fractures, especial￾ly in postmenopausal women17,18. Moreover, although both
GIO and postmenopausal osteoporosis lead to bone loss and
increased fracture risk, these bone metabolic disorders differ
in their pathophysiological mechanisms2,3,19. Thus, chronic
exposure to GC has various direct and indirect effects on bone
tissue, with a primary effect on lowering bone formation due
to inhibition of the differentiation, activity, and lifespan of the
osteoblasts and osteocytes1,3,20. In contrast, postmenopausal
osteoporosis is mainly characterized by an accelerated bone
turnover secondary to an increased rate of bone resorption due
to osteoclast hyperactivity that is not compensated for by ade￾quate bone formation to maintain a normal bone balance. The
histomorphometric analysis of biopsies from individuals
receiving GC shows a greater reduction in bone formation at
the cellular and tissue level compared with that noted in post￾menopausal osteoporosis21. Moreover, it has been suggested
that the combination of GC therapy in osteoporotic subjects
receiving longterm treatment with potent antiresorptive drugs,
such as bisphosphonates, may increase the risk for atypical
subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures22,23. Based
on the pathophysiology of GIO, it has been suggested that
pharmacological agents that stimulate bone formation and
accelerate remodeling may be a more appropriate treatment
option than antiresorptive agents for patients with GIO at high
risk for fracture5,24,25.
Teriparatide has a number of pharmacological effects that
could counteract the main mechanisms of GC-induced bone
loss. It increases the differentiation of bone lining cells and
preosteoblasts into osteoblasts, enhances osteoblast function,
and decreases osteoblast and osteocyte apoptosis26,27,28,29,
resulting in an improvement of the microarchitectural proper￾ties of the bone and an increase in its strength30,31.

Karras, et al: Teriparatide in glucocorticoid users 607
In a recent RCT in patients with GIO, Saag, et al5 showed
that 18 months of teriparatide treatment resulted in a greater
increase in BMD than alendronate treatment. Significantly
fewer subjects had new vertebral fractures in the teriparatide
group compared with the alendronate group (0.6% vs 6.1%,
respectively; p = 0.004), while the incidence of nonvertebral
fractures was similar in both groups (5.6% vs 3.7%; p = 0.36).
In the subgroup of postmenopausal women with GIO, increas￾es from baseline in lumbar spine BMD were significantly
greater in the teriparatide group compared with the alen￾dronate group (7.8% vs 3.7%; p < 0.001)32. In addition, there
were fewer new vertebral fractures in the teriparatide group
(0.9% vs 5.4% in the alendronate group; p = 0.05), and the
incidence of nonvertebral fractures was similar in both groups
(6.7% vs 4.2%; p = 0.36)32. On the basis of this RCT, the
recently published American College of Rheumatology 2010
guidelines for the prevention and treatment of GIO now rec￾ommend teriparatide as an alternative treatment option to oral
or intravenous bisphosphonates for patients at high risk of
fracture33.
Observational studies can complement RCT because they
provide information on the use and effectiveness of treatments
in routine clinical practice. EFOS was conducted in a natura￾listic setting without randomization to treatment and included
a broader range of patients than those included in the pivotal
RCT with teriparatide5,34.
Although it is difficult to compare the results of this obser￾vational study with the phase III RCT of teriparatide versus
alendronate in GIO5,32, our findings suggest that in routine
clinical practice in the European countries represented in
EFOS, teriparatide is used in patients at higher risk than the
population included in the RCT5. Compared with the subgroup
of postmenopausal women included in the RCT32, GC users in
EFOS were older (69.9 vs 61.9 years), had a lower lumbar
spine T score (–3.1 vs –2.7), and had a higher frequency of
prevalent vertebral fractures (85% vs 39%). Of note, we
observed that in normal clinical practice, despite the current
recommendations for calcium and vitamin D supplementation
in GIO35, more than one-quarter of GC users did not consis￾tently take these supplements during teriparatide therapy.
The results of our study revealed that the rapid improve￾ments from baseline in HRQOL and back pain during teri￾paratide treatment were similar in GC users and nonusers. This
improvement was significant in both groups, despite the worse
baseline HRQOL of the GC users. The benefits with regard to
back pain and HRQOL were maintained after teriparatide was
discontinued, when most of the patients received subsequent
antiresorptive therapy, mainly oral bisphosphonates.

EQ-VAS score, number of previous fractures, fracture in 12 months before study entry, age, duration of previous bisphospho￾nate use, and diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. For GC users, unadjusted mean EQ-VAS values at 0, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36
months and end of study (last observation carried forward) were 48.8 (SD 22.2), 55.7 (SD 19.2), 58.9 (SD 20.9), 59.8 (SD
22.4), 63.5 (SD 22.1), 63.6 (SD 24.5), 64.8 (SD 24.2), and 60.0 (SD 24.3), respectively. The corresponding values for the GC
nonuser group were 52.8 (SD 21.9), 59.7 (SD 19.9), 62.6 (SD 19.8), 65.6 (SD 21.1), 68.3 (SD 21.1), 68.2 (SD 21.9), 69.6 (SD
22.0), and 65.9 (SD 22.9). Between-group difference for the unadjusted scores was significant at every timepoint (p < 0.05,
2-sample t test). The unadjusted mean change from baseline to endpoint was 12.1 (SD 28.7) and 12.9 (SD 26.2) in the GC user
and nonuser groups, respectively. All values p < 0.001 versus baseline. †p < 0.05 versus GC user group.

Our study has several limitations. First, the number of
patients in the GC users group was rather small (294 patients,
18% of total study cohort). Second, the study was not ran￾domized and there was no comparator group to teriparatide, so
we cannot attribute observed changes in any endpoint to teri￾paratide treatment. Third, although the risk of fracture is relat￾ed to GC dose and duration of therapy1, we did not collect
quantitative data on these variables. Fourth, our method for
quantifying the fracture incidence may have led to an under￾estimation of fractures, because only symptomatic vertebral
fractures were considered, and it is well known that between
60% and 70% of spine fractures are asymptomatic. Fifth, as
the information on previous and concurrent medication use
was based on patient self-report, it may be subject to recall
bias. In addition, the back pain results must be interpreted
conservatively because we did not collect information on the
use of analgesics during the study. Finally, the study included
only postmenopausal women, so the findings cannot be
extended to men or premenopausal women.
As the safety of teriparatide has already been established
and was not an objective of this observational study, adverse
events were not recorded. Investigators were reminded to
report any significant adverse events to the study sponsor.
All spontaneously reported adverse events have been
 reported previously10 and confirm that teriparatide is well
 tolerated.
The strengths of our study include the recruitment of a
diverse range of patients, many of whom had comorbidities or
were taking concomitant medications often excluded in RCT,
reflecting real-life clinical practice. Other strengths are the
prospective examination of clinical fractures both during teri￾paratide therapy and after teriparatide discontinuation, the analy￾sis of pain and HRQOL using validated patient-completed
instruments, and the adjustment for potential confounding fac￾tors in the analyses, including age, prior bisphosphonate use, and
previous fracture in the 12 months before starting teriparatide.
In our study of postmenopausal women with severe osteo￾porosis treated with teriparatide for up to 18 months and fol￾lowed for an additional 18 months in a routine setting, those
who were also receiving GC, and who were therefore at even
greater risk of fracture, showed a reduced incidence of clini￾cal fractures during the third year, when most patients were
receiving sequential therapy with other osteoporosis medica￾tions. These patients also reported a significant reduction in
back pain and an improvement in HRQOL during the 18
months of teriparatide treatment, which was maintained for at
least 18 months after teriparatide was discontinued, when the
majority of patients were receiving other osteoporosis med￾Table 5. Percentage of glucocorticoid (GC) users and nonusers reporting problems (some/extreme) in each of the EQ-5D domains. Number varies for each
