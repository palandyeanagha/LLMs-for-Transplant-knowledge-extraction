lthough primary cardiac tumors are relatively rare,1
physicians unexpectedly encounter them in clini￾cal practice and it is important to establish a histo￾pathological diagnosis in order to treat them adequately; 
however, it is difficult to do so non-invasively. We describe 
a case of a primary cardiac malignant lymphoma that was 
easily and safely diagnosed histopathologically after a 
transvenous intracardiac echocardiography (ICE)-guided 
biopsy.
Case Report
A 63-year-old woman was admitted to hospital with the 
chief complaint of new onset chest discomfort and pretibial 
pitting edema. On physical examination, dilated jugular 
veins and pretibial pitting edema were noted. Auscultation 
revealed a cardiac ejection systolic murmur and normal 
vesicular lung sounds. Chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly 
(cardiothoracic ratio=64%), and the electrocardiogram 
demonstrated right-axis deviation, right bundle blanch 
block, low voltage in the limb leads, and poor R wave pro￾gression in the precordial leads. Transthoracic echocar￾diography (TTE) revealed a large invasive cardiac tumor 
protruding into the right atrium (RA) and right ventricle 
(RV), obstructing the outflow tract (RVOT) (Figs1A,B). 
There was also moderate pericardial effusion without any 
hemodynamic significance. Contrast computed tomogra￾phy (CT) also showed the large cardiac tumor measuring 
76×37mm in diameter and stretching from the RA to the 
RV and pulmonary artery (Fig2). Pericardial effusion, as

A 63-year-old woman was admitted to hospital with the chief complaint of new onset chest discomfort and pre￾tibial pitting edema. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a large invasive tumor on the heart protruding into 
the right atrium and right ventricle, which obstructed the outflow tract. She underwent transvenous 9Fr, 9-MHz 
ultra intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) (EP Technologies, Boston Scientific Corporation, San Jose, CA, USA) 
guided biopsy, and a diagnosis of malignant lymphoma was established from the specimen obtained. ICE-guided 
cardiac tumor biopsy may be one of the most useful strategies for diagnosis of cardiac tumors.  (Circ J 2009; 73:

well as mediastinal and mesenteric lymphadenopathy, were 
revealed. Because the cytology examination from the peri￾cardial effusion was negative, a percutaneous cardiac tumor 
biopsy was performed in order to establish a histopatho￾logical diagnosis. Right atriography also revealed the 
cardiac tumor protruding into the RA and RV (Fig 3A). A 
6Fr cardiac biopsy catheter (Technowood Biopsy Forceps, 
Tonokura Ika Kogyo Co Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) and 9Fr, 
9-MHz Ultra ICE catheter (EP Technologies, Boston Scien￾tific Corporation, San Jose, CA, USA) were percutaneously 
inserted into the RA via the right jugular vein and right 
femoral vein, respectively (Fig 3B). Because ICE images 
enabled detailed examination of the intracardiac structures, 
as well as an accurate surveillance of the positioning of the 
biopsy catheter (Fig4), cardiac tumor specimens were easily 
and safely taken without any complications, pain, or expo￾sure of the echocardiographer to radiation. Histopathologi￾cal analysis showed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The 
patient underwent R-THPCOP chemotherapy (rituximab, 
pirarubicin, cyclosporin, vincristine, and prednisolone). 
During the first month following the treatment, her condi￾tion improved, which correlated with the finding of a 
decrease in the tumor size, and resolution of the pericardial 
effusion and RVOT obstruction on TTE. She has remained 
well under chemotherapy as an outpatient.
Discussion
Primary cardiac tumors are relatively rare with an inci￾dence of 0.002–0.3% in autopsy series;1 however, physi￾cians unexpectedly encounter them in clinical practice and 
although the exact incidence of each specific tumor type 
can not be stated, approximately 75% of all cardiac tumors 
are histologically benign and the remainder are malignant.2
Sarcomas are the most common malignant primary cardiac 
tumors and primary cardiac lymphomas are much less 
common,3 with a relative incidence of only 2% of primary 
cardiac tumors.

ICE-Guided Cardiac Tumor Biopsy 383

such as echocardiography, CT, and magnetic resonance 
imaging can provide much important information regard￾ing the size, shape, composition, attachment, and surface 
characteristics of tumors,4,5 which are important consider￾ations for surgical excision, but surgery is not an effective 
treatment for the great majority of malignant cardiac 
tumors, because of the large mass of cardiac tissue involved, 
as in the present case, and because all cardiac tumors have 
the potential for causing life-threatening complications,6
including embolization. Thus, it is critically important to 
establish a histopathlogical diagnosis for instigation of 
appropriate treatment as soon as possible.
Previous reports demonstrate that a transvenous biopsy 
under TTE or transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) 
guidance4,7,8 is a useful diagnostic approach. Although TTE 
is the most noninvasive and convenient technique, TEE can 
provide superior imaging to TTE, especially of posteriorly 
located structures.9 However, TEE sometimes causes the 
patient pain if performed without anesthesia, and for that 
reason it may usually requires local pharyngeal anesthesia 
and sometimes general sedation. Moreover, the operator of 
the TTE or TEE is at risk of exposure to radiation during 
the procedure.
ICE is a new technique based on the use of an ultrasonic 
diagnostic catheter that can be introduced through the 
femoral vein and provides a 2-dimensional view.10 Image 
acquisition is usually from within the RA or RV. Thus, ICE 
enables complete examination of the inter-atrial and -ven￾tricular structures, as well as an accurate surveillance of the 
positioning of intracardiac devices11 such as a biopsy cath￾eter. A major advantage of ICE is its potential to provide 
superior information to TEE,10,11 as well as avoiding general 
sedation and exposure of the echocardiographer to radia￾tion. Therefore, ICE may be one of the most useful diag￾nostic strategies and should be considered when trying to 
diagnose the histopathology of cardiac tumors. At present, 
however, the main limiting factor is its high cost, which is 
related to the single-use catheters.
