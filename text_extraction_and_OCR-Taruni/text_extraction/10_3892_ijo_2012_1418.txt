Abstract. Cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) is a member of 
the cytochrome p450 enzyme family, which is involved in the 
metabolisms of carcinogenic metabolites, such as benzo(a)
pyrene. In this study, we identified miR-892a as a negative 
regulator of CYP1A1 expression. Luciferase assays revealed a 
sequence in the 3'-untranslated region of CYP1A1 that displayed 
a perfect match with miR-892a, and revealed that this sequence 
was a specific miR-892a target site. The overexpression of 
miR‑892a inhibited the expression of the CYP1A1 protein, and 
the miR‑892a antagonist increased CYP1A1 expression. Of 
note, benzo(a)pyrene, a major inducer of CYP1A1 transcrip￾tion, decreased the expression of miR-892a. Moreover, the 
miR-892a-induced CYP1A1 repression inhibited the benzo(a)
pyrene-mediated decrease in cell viability. These data provide 
insight into the CYP1A1 regulatory network.
Introduction
Cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) is a key carcinogen-metabo￾lizing enzyme that catalyzes the hydroxylation of environmental 
carcinogens including benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) (1). After cells are 
exposed to BaP-containing pollutants, BaP binds to and acti￾vates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which subsequently 
translocates to the nucleus (2). The activated AhR interacts 
with the aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator and induces 
the upregulation of CYP1A1 expression (3). The upregulated 
CYP1A1 converts BaP into a metabolite that can form DNA 
adducts. Moreover, high CYP1A1 inducibility phenotypes 
and the MspI polymorphism are suspected to correlate with 
increased lung cancer frequency.
Although AhR is a major regulator of CYP1A1 gene expres￾sion, other regulatory proteins have been reported to be involved 
in CYP1A1 induction. For instance, peroxisome proliferator￾activated receptor α (PPARα), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 
(HNF4), and its co-activator, PPARγ coactivator 1α (PGC1α), 
have been found to induce CYP1A1 transcription. Furthermore, 
the transcription factor OCT-1 inhibits CYP1A1 expression. 
However, these factors merely control CYP1A1 transcription.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that 
function as post-transcriptional regulators to inhibit mRNA 
translation (4-6). The presence of miRNAs has been described 
in heterogenic cell processes, such as differentiation, apop￾tosis, hematopoiesis, fat metabolism and limb morphogenesis 
(7-10). A number of miRNAs have been identified and have 
provided important information as regards drug metabolism. 
miR-27b is a specific negative regulator of CYP1B1 that is 
known to be involved in drug metabolism and tumorigenesis 
(11,12). miR-27a and miR-451, which are upregulated in 
multidrug-resistant cancer cell lines, induce the overexpres￾sion of the drug resistance-related protein, P-glycoprotein, in 
multidrug-resistant cell lines (13). Although many studies have 
demonstrated the importance of miRNAs in the regulation of 
drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters, the negative 
regulation of CYP1A1 expression at the post-transcriptional 
level remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that the 
translational repression of CYP1A1 mRNA expression is medi￾ated by miR-892a.

Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). The cells were cultured in 
MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml 
penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin and maintained at 37˚C 
in a 5% CO2 incubator. Transfection was performed using 
Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) 
for 5 h in serum-free medium. After changing the medium, the 
cells were incubated for 24-48 h and harvested.
Quantitative real-time PCR analysis. The cDNAs were 
synthesized from total RNAs by using the miScript Reverse 
Transcription kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's 
instructions. The primer for human precursor miR-892a 
(pre‑miR-892a) was 5'-CACUGUGUCCUUUCUGCGUAG-3'. 
The forward and reverse primers for human U6 snRNA were 
5'-CGCTTCGGCAGCACATATACTAA-3' and 5'-TATGGA 
ACGCTTCACGAATTTGC-3', respectively. The cycling 
protocol for human pre-miR-892a was as follows: initial 
denaturation at 95˚C for 5 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95˚C 
for 15 sec, 63˚C for 20 sec, and 72˚C for 30 sec. The PCR 
protocol for human U6 snRNA was as follows: initial dena￾turation at 95˚C for 30 sec, followed by 45 cycles of 94˚C for 
10 sec (denaturation) and 62˚C for 20 sec (annealing and 
extension). PCR was performed using the miScript SYBR￾Green PCR kit (Qiagen) with Line-Gene K software (Bioer 
Technology Co. Ltd., Hangzhou, China).
Cell viability assay. Cell viability was assessed using the MTS 
assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). The 
results are graphically represented as the measured cell viability 
ratio normalized to the control.
Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis was performed 
as described previously (14). A primary antibody specific 
for CYP1A1 was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology 
(Santa Cruz, CA, USA). An anti-β-actin antibody was purchased 
from Sigma-Aldrich.
Construction of 3'-UTR reporter plasmids and luciferase assay. 
To construct luciferase reporter plasmids, various target frag￾ments were ligated into the XbaI site downstream of the 
luciferase gene in the pGL3-promoter vector. The sequence of 
the miR-892a recognition element (MRE892a) spanned from 
2021 to +2080 of the human CYP1A1 gene (5'-GAACUAGG 
CUGCAAUCUGACCCUAUGGGUCUAGGACACAGUUCCU 
GGGAA-3'). A fragment containing the perfect matching 
sequence of the mature miR-892a, 5'-CUAUGGGUCUAGG 
ACACAGU-3' (the matching sequence of miR-892a is italicized), 
was cloned into the pGL3 promoter vector (pGL3-MRE892a). 
The region (+1661 to +2609) in the human CYP1A1 gene 
containing MRE892a was amplified by PCR using the following 
primers adapted to the XbaI site: 5'-GCTCTAGAGTGCTT 
GAGAGCCCTGAG-3' and 5'-GCTCTAGA CTGAACAATAT 
CTTTATTTAGC-3'. The pGL3 promoter plasmid containing 
the 3'-UTR of CYP1A1 was termed pGL3‑3'UTR. DNA 
sequencing analyses confirmed the nucleotide sequences of 
the constructed plasmids. For luciferase assays, various 
luciferase reporter plasmids (pGL3) were transiently trans￾fected with the precursors for miR-892a, the control, or the 
antago-miR for miR-892a and the pSV-β-gal plasmid into the 
cells. Briefly, 500 ng pGL3 plasmid and 200 ng pSV-β-gal 
plasmid were transfected using Lipofectamine plus reagent into 
the cells. After incubation for 48 h, the cells were re-suspended 
in Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega Corp., Madison, WI, USA), 
and then the luciferase activity was measured with a Veritas 
Luminometer (Turnur Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). The relative 
luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity 
and presented as the fold activation with standard deviations. The 
results are the averages of three independent experiments.
Results
miR-892a contains a complementary sequence of the 3'-UTR 
of human CYP1A1 mRNA. To identify human miRNAs that can 
regulate CYP1A1 expression, we used the target scan program 
to predict miRNAs and found that miR-892a was highly 
scored for targeting CYP1A1 in all three algorithms, namely 
TargetScan, miRanda (MicroCosm), and PicTar (15-17). The 
predicted target site for miR-892a is encoded by nucleotides 
515-535 in the 3'-UTR of CYP1A1 mRNA (Fig. 1). In addition, 
miR-892a contains a conserved target sequence of the 3'-UTR 
of CYP1A1 in humans and other mammalian species, including 
the chimpanzee. This region was termed MRE892a. From 
these in silico results illustrating that a cognate miR-892a target 
region is located in the 3'-UTR of CYP1A1, we hypothesized 
that miR‑892a could modulate the expression of CYP1A1 by 
targeting MRE892a.
miR-892a regulates the mRNA expression of CYP1A1. First, we 
determined whether the expression of miR-892a and CYP1A1 
is negatively correlated. To investigate this, we used antago￾miRNA to reduce the levels of endogenous miR-892a in MCF7 
cells. The treatment of the cells with antago-miR-892a reduced 
miR-892a expression (Fig. 2A) and increased the mRNA and 
protein expression of CYP1A1 (Fig. 2B). It has previously 
been reported that CYP1A1 mRNA and protein expression are 
induced by BaP via the activation of AhR, which is a known 
CYP1A1 gene transcription factor. Therefore, we next exam￾ined whether the CYP1A1 mRNA expression was affected 
by miR‑892a. As shown in Fig. 2C, the expression levels of 
CYP1A1 mRNA and protein were dramatically increased 
after BaP treatment in the cells; however, this upregulation 
was markedly inhibited by treatment with miR-892a mimics 
compared with the inhibition induced by the control and control 
mimics. These results indicate that miR-892a is an effective 
post-transcriptional regulator of CYP1A1 mRNA.
3'-UTR of CYP1A1 is a target for miR-892a. We then exam￾ined whether the negative regulation of CYP1A1 expression 
by miR‑892a is due to a direct interaction between miR-892a 
and the predicted binding site in the 3'-UTR of CYP1A1. We 
therefore constructed recombinant luciferase reporter plasmids 
in which the 3'-UTR (pGL3-3'-UTR) and MRE892a (pGL3-
MRE892a) of CYP1A1 were cloned downstream of the firefly 
luciferase reporter gene in pGL3 vectors (Fig. 3A). These 
reporter plasmids were co-transfected with either the miR-892a 
mimics or its antago-miR in MCF7 cells, and then luciferase 
activity was measured after 24 h after transfection. As shown 
in Fig. 3B, the overexpression of miR-892a markedly decreased 
the luciferase activities of pGL3-3'-UTR and pGL3-MRE892a 
by 30 and 50%, respectively, compared to those of the control.

Inversely, this downregulation was rescued by co-transfection 
with antago-miR-892a, indicating that miR-892a negatively 
regulates CYP1A1 expression post-transcriptionally by directly 
recognizing MRE892a in the 3'-UTR of CYP1A1.
BaP decreases miR-892a expression. As the upregulation of 
CYP1A1 expression is highly induced by BaP treatment (3), 
we examined whether BaP could affect the expression level of 
CYP1A1 by regulating miR-892a expression. To test this hypoth￾Figure 1. In silico analysis of CYP1A1 mRNAs and the predicted target sequence of miR-892a. As regards numbering, the ATG codon is numbered +1, and the 
coding region of human CYP1A1 spans to +1539 (black box). The sequences of the 3'-UTR and MRE892a are located from +1540 to +2487 and from +2054 to +2073

334 CHOI et al: miR-892a REGULATES THE EXPRESSION OF CYP1A1
esis, we first examined the expression levels of miR-892a upon 
stimulation with BaP in MCF7 cells. Interestingly, BaP greatly 
decreased miR-892a expression in a concentration-dependent 
manner (Fig. 4A). This result led to us examine whether BaP 
could decrease not only the expression level of miR-892a, but 
also the activity of this miRNA activity by blocking the trans￾lation of the CYP1A1 transcript. To test this hypothesis, we 
used recombinant luciferase reporter plasmids, such as pGL3 
control, pGL3-3'-UTR and pGL3-MRE892a (see Materials 
and methods) and co-transfected these plasmids with antago￾miR-892a into BaP-stimulated MCF7 cells. We found that the 
luciferase activities of pGL3-3'-UTR and pGL3-MRE892a 
were decreased by 20 and 30%, respectively, compared to 
those in the control pGL3-transfected MCF7 cells (Fig. 4B). 
However, this downregulation was completely blocked by BaP 
stimulation, suggesting that BaP negatively regulates miR-892a 
expression and activity (Fig. 4B). Similarly, antago-miR-892a 
perfectly restored the downregulated luciferase activities 
in pGL3-3'-UTR- and pGL3-MRE892a-transfected cells 
(Fig. 4B). These results indicate that the regulatory mechanism 
between miR-892a and its target CTP1A1 is controlled by BaP 
stimulation.
miR-892a inhibits BaP-induced loss of cell proliferation. As 
the CYP1A1 upregulation, which is induced by BaP stimula￾tion, decreases cell proliferation (18), we investigated the effect 
of miR-892a on proliferation in BaP-stimulated cells. First, we 
confirmed that BaP decreased MCF7 cell viability and induced 
CYP1A1 expression in a concentration-dependent manner 
(Fig. 5A). The MCF7 cells were then transfected with CYP1A1 
target-specific siRNA. Following 24 h of transfection, cells 
were treated with 40 µM BaP for 24 h. The siRNA completely 
blocked CYP1A1 expression (Fig. 5B, bottom panel) and 
inhibited the BaP-induced loss of cell viability compared to 
the findings in control and negative control siRNA-transfected 
cells (Fig. 5B, top panel). Similarly, miR-892a mimics also 
restored the BaP-induced loss of cell viability (Fig. 5C). These 
results suggest that miR-892a negatively regulates CYP1A1 
function by inhibiting cell growth suppression in the presence 
of BaP.
Discussion
The present study demonstrates that miR-892a is a direct 
transcriptional target of CYP1A1 that negatively regulates 
BaP-induced cell growth suppression by inhibiting CY1A1 
expression. Our in silico analysis revealed that miR-892a 
has a high-affinity binding site in the 3'-UTR of CYP1A1. In 
MCF7 cells, antago-miR-892a upregulated CYP1A1 mRNA 
and protein expression. Conversely, the miR-892a mimics 
decreased the expression level of CYP1A1 in MCF7 cells. 
Furthermore, luciferase reporter assays revealed that miR-892a 
can directly target the MRE892a-containing region in the 
3'-UTR of CYP1A1. Of note, both the expression level and the 
translation-repressing activity of miR-892a were decreased by 
BaP stimulation, which is a well-known inducer of CYP1A1 
expression in cells. In addition, the BaP-mediated loss of cell 
viability was blocked through the repression of CYP1A1 expres￾Figure 3. CYP1A1 is a target of miR-892a. (A) A series of luciferase reporter constructs containing the 3'-UTR and MRE892a of CYP1A1 genes. The 3'-UTR and

336 CHOI et al: miR-892a REGULATES THE EXPRESSION OF CYP1A1
sion by miR-892a overexpression. Overall, our data indicate that 
miR‑892a is a novel regulator of BaP-induced CYP1A1 expres￾sion by directly repressing CYP1A1 expression, inducing BaP/
CYP1A1-mediated cell growth suppression.
Recent studies have highlighted the importance of 3'-UTRs 
in gene regulation, especially via miRNA-mediated interference 
or silencing of mRNA (19). Many types of CYP mRNAs have 
different sequences in different human populations; therefore, 
miRNA and siRNA play an important role in this regulation. 
For example, miR-27b has a near-perfect matching sequence in 
the 3'-UTR of CYP1B1, through which it directly suppresses 
CYP1B1 gene expression. In particular, the expression levels 
of miR-27b and CYP1B1 protein in cancerous and adjacent 
non-cancerous breast tissues from patients are significantly 
and inversely correlated (11,20). CYP17 is critical in androgen 
biosynthesis, and CYP17 mRNA expression has been proven 
to be augmented in thecal cells from a patient with polycystic 
ovary syndrome. siRNA-mediated CYP17 mRNA depletion can 
reduce steroid synthesis in cells (21). siRNA duplexes targeting 
CYP4B1 reduced the expression of this gene by 60%, and 
12-HETrE levels were barely detected in corneal homogenates 
from eyes. These results strongly implicate corneal CYP4B1 
as a component of the inflammatory and neovascular cascade 
initiated by injury (22). Recently, analysis of genetic varia￾tion revealed a region of the CYP1A1 locus having decreased 
nucleotide diversity in the pooled populations, possibly due 
to a selective sweep (23). Of note, the analysis of the 3'-UTR 
of the CYP1A1 gene revealed that most single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) are concentrated in the region (23). In 
addition, an in silico study identified different miRNA-binding 
patterns in the region when mutations were present compared 
to when mutations were absent (23). These data suggest that 
SNPs affected by selective sweeping, which are located in the 
CYP1A1 3'-UTR are worthy of further investigation. Although 
the miR-892a expression levels in tissues or populations have 
not yet been researched, our findings, for the first time, suggest 
that miR-892a can regulate the CYP1A1 pathway activated by 
pollutants such as BaP.
Although AhR mainly induces BaP-mediated CYP1A1 
expression, our findings indicate that this novel pathway of 
BaP-mediated miR-892a suppression can also induce CYP1A1 
expression. There are a number of reports demonstrating 
AhR-independent CYP1A1 gene expression. For example, 
dibenso(α)pyrene has been shown to induce CYP1A1 mRNA 
expression in AhR knockout mice (24). In addition, 3-meth￾ylcholanthrene has been shown to increase CYP1A1 protein 
levels in AhR knockout mice (25).
Although the accurate mechanisms of BaP-dependent 
miR‑892a downregulation are largely uncovered, the aforemen￾tioned reports and our findings indicate that an AhR-independent 
pathway provides a possible future investigation topic for 
CYP1A1-related fields.
