Abstract
Development of a human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-based therapy for type 1 diabetes will require the translation of proof￾of-principle concepts into a scalable, controlled, and regulated cell manufacturing process. We have previously
demonstrated that hESC can be directed to differentiate into pancreatic progenitors that mature into functional
glucose-responsive, insulin-secreting cells in vivo. In this study we describe hESC expansion and banking methods and a
suspension-based differentiation system, which together underpin an integrated scalable manufacturing process for
producing pancreatic progenitors. This system has been optimized for the CyT49 cell line. Accordingly, qualified large-scale
single-cell master and working cGMP cell banks of CyT49 have been generated to provide a virtually unlimited starting
resource for manufacturing. Upon thaw from these banks, we expanded CyT49 for two weeks in an adherent culture format
that achieves 50–100 fold expansion per week. Undifferentiated CyT49 were then aggregated into clusters in dynamic
rotational suspension culture, followed by differentiation en masse for two weeks with a four-stage protocol. Numerous
scaled differentiation runs generated reproducible and defined population compositions highly enriched for pancreatic cell
lineages, as shown by examining mRNA expression at each stage of differentiation and flow cytometry of the final
population. Islet-like tissue containing glucose-responsive, insulin-secreting cells was generated upon implantation into
mice. By four- to five-months post-engraftment, mature neo-pancreatic tissue was sufficient to protect against
streptozotocin (STZ)-induced hyperglycemia. In summary, we have developed a tractable manufacturing process for the
generation of functional pancreatic progenitors from hESC on a scale amenable to clinical entry.

Introduction
Since the development of the Edmonton protocol [1], clinical
islet transplantation has proven the feasibility of a curative
treatment for type 1 diabetes, a debilitating disease caused by
autoimmune destruction of pancreatic b-cells. Replacing lost b-cell
function is an effective therapeutic strategy, but the shortage of
pancreata available for islet isolation places serious constraints on
this intervention option [2]. Therefore, efforts are focused on
developing a larger scale source of pancreatic cells with clinical
utility. Human embryonic stem cells (hESC) are an attractive
option due to their vast proliferative and differentiation potential
[3], [4]. Using a step-wise protocol, we have demonstrated that
hESC can be directed to differentiate to a mixed population
comprised of pancreatic endoderm (PE) and poly-hormonal
endocrine cells [5], [6], [7]. Implanted PE gives rise to functioning
islet-like structures in vivo through a mechanism that appears to
primarily involve the de novo commitment of pancreatic progenitors
to the endocrine lineages followed by further maturation to
glucose-responsive b-cells. Such grafts are therefore capable of
sensing blood glucose, responding with metered release of
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 5 | e37004

processed human insulin, and protecting against streptozotocin
(STZ)-induced hyperglycemia in mice [6], [7]. Implantation of
enriched populations has demonstrated that PE, defined as
chromogranin A (CHGA) negative and NKX6-1/PDX1 co￾positive, and not the poly-hormonal endocrine cells, are progen￾itors of these islet-like structures [7].
The production of hESC-derived pancreatic progenitors offers a
promising approach to circumvent issues with the supply of clinical
cadaveric islets [3]. Nonetheless, bringing a cell therapy to the
clinic requires developing manufacturing processes that consis￾tently generate pancreatic populations that are functional and safe,
eventually at a scale sufficient to produce many human doses in
single manufactured lots. Thus far, protocols for generating hESC￾derived pancreatic cells with proven utility to regulate blood
glucose in vivo have only been described on a small scale using
adherent cell culture formats that exhibit variable cell composi￾tions [6], [7]. While other candidate pancreatic lineages have been
derived from hESC [8], [9], [10], [11], none have demonstrated
robust post-engraftment function in vivo, as defined by both long￾term glucose-responsive human C-peptide secretion and protec￾tion against STZ-induced hyperglycemia [12], [13], [14]. Without
demonstrated function in animal models, it is difficult to gauge the
scalability, or clinical potential, of these alternate protocols.
Limitations in the methods for cryopreservation, expansion, and
directed differentiation all restrict the ability to generate large
amounts of functional pancreatic progenitors from hESC.
Furthermore, it is not yet feasible to expand a stable endodermal
progenitor that maintains a comparable differentiation potential in
vivo. As we typically observe a near 1:1 ratio of starting hESC to
differentiated end-stage cells [5], our strategy to increase the
amount of implantable material produced has therefore concen￾trated on efficient expansion of hESC, followed by their
differentiation to pancreatic progenitors en masse.
With a doubling time of approximately 24 hrs [15], hESC
exhibit a remarkable capacity for expansion in culture if harnessed
effectively. As a proof-of-concept for this capacity, we have
previously demonstrated that feeder-free conditions using defined
media can support single cell passaging and bulk culture of hESC
[16]. A single batch of .161010 BG02 hESC was produced that
represented an expansion of four orders of magnitude in 6
passages [16]. Critical for the progression of hESC-based
technology to clinical trials is a demonstration of comparable
scalability using cGMP-compliant manufacturing processes with
appropriately developed reagents. Improvements that enhance
expansion efficiencies will also save time and produce cost savings,
as well as minimize the potential for population drift over time
spent in culture [17]. Importantly, robust scaling and cryopreser￾vation of hESC will enable the established strategy of master- and
working-cell banks (MCB and WCB, respectively) to be employed,
and will provide defined and consistent material for product
manufacture.
In this report, we describe coupled processes that permit scaled
production of hESC and thereafter, pancreatic progenitors. A
feeder-free culture system was developed for expansion of the
CyT49 hESC line (NIH registration number: 0041. [6]) and the
generation of large-scale, single cell MCB and WCB of CyT49
under cGMP. We also developed a rotational suspension-based
differentiation method. The reproducibility of this protocol was
demonstrated by performing repeated differentiation runs with
consistent pancreatic cell compositions and production of glucose￾responsive insulin-secreting cells after maturation of progenitors in
vivo in many cohorts of mice. Levels of human insulin release were
sufficient to protect against STZ-induced hyperglycemia, and
implants were capable of prolonged engraftment. Moreover, as a
proof of scalability, we report the production of 3.36109
pancreatic cells in a single manufactured lot with only four
passages from a single thawed vial of a high-density CyT49 bank.
Our suspension-based approach coupled with scaled hESC
culture, represents an integrated and robust methodology that
will be the foundation for manufacturing pancreatic progenitors
for clinical trials.
Results
Scalable Conditions for Adherent hESC and cGMP Cell
Banking
We have developed a feeder-free culture method for hESC, to
enable scaled expansion of adherent cultures of the CyT49 cell
line, and the cGMP production of cell banks from single-cell
suspensions. The media was composed of DMEM/F12 supple￾mented with Xeno-free KnockOutTM Serum Replacement,
recombinant heregulin-1b and activin A, a formulation providing
self-renewal signaling similar to the defined media we described
previously [16], [18]. Cell attachment was facilitated using a
soluble activity present in human serum, which was added to the
media on the first day of each passage. Undifferentiated CyT49
cells could be maintained under these conditions, using serial
passaging with AccutaseTM (Fig. S1), which was the approach
taken for all the experiments described here. Accutase was the only
reagent in these conditions with xeno-sourced components.
Optimization of our conditions increased expansion efficiencies
by defining plating densities for either a three- or four-day interval
of culture, and refinements to feeding volumes and schedules. We
found that tight control over cell dissociation, increasing the
volume of media used in each subsequent day of culture and
feeding with fresh media for several hrs on the day of passage were
instrumental in maintaining cell viabilities and plating efficiencies
of .90% (Fig. S2). The method was applied to the routine culture
of CyT49 in large T-flasks, and cell factories, achieving 50–100
fold expansion per week (Table S1).
A series of CyT49 cell banks were generated using this scalable
system (Table 1, Fig. S3A). Cryopreservation of hESC has
traditionally been a problem, characterized by poor viability
and/or plating efficiency of thawed cell clusters [19]. The original
cGMP hESC banks of CyT49, MCB1 and WCB1, were made
with cell clusters, which are not amenable to rapid, or scalable,
post-thaw expansion and differentiation. Banks of dissociated
CyT49 cells were therefore prepared to demonstrate that cultures
could be successfully expanded on a large scale and cryopreserved
as single-cell suspensions, and that high thaw viabilities and plating
efficiencies could be achieved in such a format. The research cell
banks RCB-D and RCB-Dw were prepared from cultures of
CyT49 that had been previously adapted to culture in defined
media [18]. Thaw viability of RCB-D was 93.162.6% (mean 6
SD, n = 5 vials) and these cultures averaged a 3.6-fold expansion
within 4 days, by the first post-thaw passage. RCB-Dw was
generated after an additional 3 passages from a thawed vial of
RCB-D, and exhibited a thaw viability of 93.963.2% (n = 3 vials).
Cell counting after 24 hrs of culture, which takes into account
plating efficiency, proliferation and cell death, indicated that
93.466.4% of the plated cell number remained (n = 3). We
observed similar thaw and expansion efficiencies from a single cell
bank of the BG02 cell line [16]. Here we confirm and extend these
findings to demonstrate the ability to cryopreserve banks of hESC
in single-cell format using a classic master and working cell bank
strategy. Next, separate thaws from MCB1 were transitioned to
single-cell conditions, expanded and cryopreserved as RCB-E and
RCB-G, in order to trial and optimize the procedure for high￾Production of Functional Pancreatic Progenitors

density banking at 107 cells/vial. Thaw viabilities of 87.865.7%
and 85.562.1% (n = 3 vials) were observed for RCB-E and RCB￾G, respectively, and 24 hr cell counts were 98.2613.8% and
102.3612.8% of plated cells, respectively. Following these pilot
studies, single cell MCB and WCB were generated according to
cGMP for eventual product manufacturing (Table 1). Two vials
each of MCB1 and WCB1 were thawed, transitioned to feeder￾free conditions in xeno-free growth media, expanded and
cryopreserved independently as MCB3, MCB4 and MCB5. While
karyotypically normal prior to cryopreservation, a fourth expan￾sion (MCB6) was disqualified after mosaic aneuploid populations
were observed within four passages of thawing banked cells. After
in vitro qualification and in vivo functional evaluation, WCB4B was
produced from MCB4 according to cGMP. Thawed cultures from
these banks were shown to exhibit a normal karyotype by G￾banding (Table 1). Further examination indicated that banked
cells were undifferentiated and retained characteristics of hESC
such as an undifferentiated morphology and markers of pluripo￾tent cells (Fig. S3B–D). In order to demonstrate the capacity for
rapid bulk-expansion of CyT49 cultures, we produced 2.76109
cells from a single vial of 107 cryopreserved cells in standard tissue
culture T-flasks and cell stacks in a 2-week period (Table S1, Table
S2 Expt #21). Only ,25% of the potential expansion capacity of
this culture was utilized, indicating that as many as 1–261010
CyT49 cells could have been readily generated within the same
time frame.
Reproducible Production of Functional Pancreatic
Progenitors with a Scalable Suspension-Based
Manufacturing Process
To circumvent surface-area constraints of adherent-based
systems and permit manufacturing-scale culture and differentia￾tion, we developed suspension methodologies for the production of
pancreatic progenitors. Adherent hESC were dissociated to single
cells and aggregated in suspension to generate three-dimensional
spheres of undifferentiated cells (Fig. 1, Fig. S4). Cells were seeded
at 16106 cells/mL in ultra-low adhesion 6-well dishes and
incubated under rotation on an orbital platform. Principles of
bioengineering design were used to examine factors that
influenced adhesion and aggregation in suspension [20], such as
seeding density, volume, rotational radius and speed, collision
frequency and shear rate, in a systematic optimization of
aggregation (not shown). Under optimal conditions, aggregates
formed by self-association overnight, generating spherical clusters
with diameters of 100–200 mm. Modeling of diffusion rates
suggests that aggregates of this size would not be expected to be
substantially impacted by mass transfer limitations [21]. Efficient
rates of incorporation into aggregates were typically observed, in
the range of 75% of input cells after 24 hrs (Fig. S4). Aggregates
displayed high uniformity and lacked cavitation, cystic structures,
or cellular layering that would indicate spontaneous differentia￾tion. The completely undifferentiated nature of these aggregates
was indicated by the maintenance of uniform expression of hESC

markers and absence of gene expression for differentiated
phenotypes (Figs. S4, S6). Undifferentiated cultures of hESC
could be maintained in suspension via serial passaging of
aggregates (Fig. S4).
We adapted our previously reported pancreatic differentiation
protocols [6], [7], to the suspension system and optimized the
methodology to enable efficient and large-scale differentiation of
the CyT49 cell line (Fig. 1). Differentiation of CyT49 was initiated
the day after hESC aggregation, and was typically carried out over
12 days (Fig. S5), although in some cases Stage-4 was extended up
to 8 days (d16). As before, the procedure entailed directing the
cells through successive intermediates including mesendoderm
(d1), definitive endoderm (d2), nascent gut endoderm (d5),
posterior foregut endoderm (d8), and pancreatic endoderm (PE)
with endocrine precursors (d12), en route to robust hormone
expression (d16) (Fig. 1A). The suspension differentiation protocol
involved only a few modifications from our previous publications
[5], [6], [7]. The TGF-b RI kinase Inhibitor IV was included
during Stage-2, and retinoic acid was replaced with a more stable
retinoid analog, TTNPB (3 nM), during Stage-3. The growth
factors KGF (50 ng/mL) and EGF (50 ng/mL) were added to
Stage-4 to preserve cell mass. Noggin (50 ng/mL) was also
included at Stage-4. Using TGFb inhibitors, other reports have
described increased production of endocrine cells, principally poly￾hormonal in nature [22], [23], an effect we have also observed
(data not shown). Sectioning of undifferentiated aggregates and
aggregates at the end of Stages-2 and -4, confirmed that distinct
transitions in cellular architecture occurred during differentiation
(Fig. 1B–D).
Using this modified protocol, a series of thirty-seven indepen￾dent differentiation runs were carried out to assess the reproduc￾ibility of this scalable manufacturing process. To minimize
technical dissimilarity from batch-to-batch and between multiple
handlers, tight controls on cell culture variables were implement￾ed. Each process began with a thaw from one of the large-scale
single cell CyT49 hESC banks, followed by acute expansion in
adherent culture. These scaled cultures maintained a normal
karyotype (Table S2). Starting from expanded undifferentiated
cultures of typically 6.66108 CyT49 cells, hESC were aggregated
and differentiated en masse.
Extensive analyses of gene expression and cellular composition
were used to characterize differentiating aggregates. Rare OCT4-
immunoreactive cells persisted until day 5 of differentiation at the
latest, and at this time point were only detected in small pockets of
cells within aggregates that consisted predominantly of OCT42/
-
FOXA2+ target endoderm cells (Fig. 1E, F). These OCT4+ cells
also expressed SOX2, but not NANOG (not shown), indicating
that they were not likely to be pluripotent stem cells. By the end of
Stage-4, nuclear-localized NKX6-1 and PDX1 transcription
factors were detected in aggregates, marking PE in a mixed
pancreatic population that also included NKX2-2+ and CHGA+
endocrine cells (Fig. 1G, H). Some non-endocrine PDX1+ cells
that did not express NKX6-1 were present as well; it is not known
if these cells represent an earlier stage of PDX1+ pancreatic
progenitors, or a non-pancreatic lineage such as posterior
stomach, or duodenum [6]. Unlike NKX6-1+
/PDX1+/2 PE,
which has demonstrated islet cell neogenesis potential in vivo [7],
the potential for NKX6-12/
PDX1+ endoderm to contribute to
functional b-cell mass in vivo is at this point unclear.
We also assessed the cellular compositions of undifferentiated d0
aggregates, and at day 2, day 12 and day 16 of differentiation
using flow cytometry. The proportion of SOX17+
/FOXA2+ cells
increased from a rare 1.76% at d0, to 99.0% of the population
after two days of differentiation, indicating highly efficient
specification of definitive endoderm (Fig. 2A). The composition
of each of the thirty-seven scaled differentiation runs was
examined at Stage-4 (n = 45 d12, n = 4 d16 analyses), demon￾strating that a large majority of differentiated cells expressed
CHGA, NKX6-1, or PDX1 (Fig. 2B, Table S2). Differentiation
runs contained 40–65% immature endocrine or poly-hormonal
cells (CHGA+
), 16–47% PE cells (CHGA2/
NKX6-1+
), and 7–
32% PDX1-expressing endoderm (CHGA2/
NKX6-12/
PDX1+
).
Typically, fewer than 2% of cells failed to be demarcated by any of
these three markers, compared to the ,10% that were observed in
the best examples of our previous plate-based adherent differen￾tiation methodology [7]. While the proportions of distinct cell
subsets varied to some extent among differentiation runs, the low
frequency of unidentified cell types (CHGA2/
NKX6-12/
PDX12)
was consistently observed. Differentiation runs extended to d16
did not differ markedly in cellular composition from d12
populations (Table S2), although immuofluorescent analyses
confirmed that expression of endocrine hormones became more
robust (data not shown).
To compare the outcomes of the differentiation process from
different banks, as well as to model lot-to-lot variation, we focused
a more detailed analysis on a selected group (n = 13 differentiation
runs, 3 banks, 17 cytometric analyses). Included in this group was
a batch that utilized 2.76109 hESC and yielded 3.36109 Stage-4
cells, as a demonstration of the scalability of this process (Table S2
Expt #21). Two groups of processes that were performed semi￾consecutively, termed ‘‘13C’’, were selected to investigate lot-to-lot
consistency (Table S2). Group 1 consisted of: MCB4 expt #18–20,
RCB-Dw expt #25–30 (9 sequential runs); and Group 2 of:
MCB4 expt #21, WCB4B expt #35–37 (4 sequential runs). Box￾plots of the cellular composition of all the manufacturing runs
(Table S2) compared to the 13C group, demonstrated a robust
and consistent distribution of pancreatic lineages in sequential
experiments (Fig. 2C). A bank comparison confirmed that such
consistency was achieved from 6 different CyT49 banks (Fig. 2D),
indicating excellent process control over pancreatic specification.
An average of 51.961.5 (mean 6 SEM)% immature endocrine or
poly-hormonal cells, 31.961.0% PE cells, and 14.461.0% PDX1-
expressing endoderm were observed, with only 1.860.4% of cells
not positively stained for any of these markers (Fig. 2D). The
means within the PE, endocrine, or PDX-1 only groups were not
statistically different, whereas the mean of the residual population

(CHGA2/
NKX6-12/
PDX12) in the differentiation runs from
MCB4 was lower than those from the RCB-D, MCB3, RCB-Dw
and WCB4B banks (p,0.01). While highlighting change in only a
minor fraction of the population, it suggests that the four MCB4-
derived differentiation runs exhibited the tightest technical control
over target lineage specification.
Gene expression analysis of the 13C group by digital mRNA
profiling [24], [25] also highlighted the reproducibility of our
system (Fig. 3, Figs. S6, S7), in particular the consistency of mRNA
dynamics between independent experiments. In addition to the
expected sequence of target mesendoderm, endoderm, gut and
pancreatic lineage marker expression as cells proceed through
each successive stage of differentiation, we observed the rapid
downregulation of markers of undifferentiated cells, such as OCT4
(Fig. 3, POU5F1), NANOG, SOX2, DPPA4 (Fig. S6) and very
low expression levels of markers for mesoderm, neural ectoderm,
trophectoderm, and intestinal, or liver endoderm phenotypes (Figs.
S6, S7). The precise dynamics of gene regulation from stage-to￾stage and from process-to-process confirm tight control of each
stage of differentiation. We expect that the elevated level of process
control implemented through all phases of scaled hESC culture,
aggregation and differentiation contributes to minimizing overall
process variation.
Reproducibility of Generating Functional Glucose￾responsive, Insulin-secreting Cells in vivo
We tested the pancreatic populations generated in thirty-one
scaled differentiation runs (Table S2) for the capacity to generate
islet-like tissue with functional insulin-secreting cells after implan￾tation into the epididymal fat pad (EFP) of male SCID/Bg mice.
In total, 240 mice were implanted with typically 36106 cells, in 44
cohorts, of which 228 (95%) showed evidence of cell engraftment,
remained healthy through at least 3 months and exhibited a
functional response to glucose challenge (GSIS: glucose-stimulated
insulin secretion, Fig. S8A). Based on our previous findings, we
scored mice with a maximal-stimulated-release of .2000 pM
serum human C-peptide as a high-functioning group (Figs. 4A,
S8B, n = 166 mice (69%), 457462415 (mean 6 SD) pM, weeks
21–50) which would be fully protected against STZ-induced
hyperglycemia [6]. A second group of 62 mice (26%) also
exhibited glucose-stimulated release of human C-peptide (Fig.
S8C, 11096573 pM, weeks 16–25), but did not reach this
2000 pM benchmark by 25 weeks post-engraftment. Such animals
would be predicted to be partially protected in our STZ-lesion
paradigm. To enable more refined analyses of the development of
graft function, we examined the GSIS data at various time points
after implantation (Fig. 4A). As we have observed previously [6],
the implanted cells in the high functioning group produced
increasing levels of both basal and stimulated human C-peptide as
the grafts matured over time (weeks 5–10 vs. 11–50, p,0.01).
Human C-peptide was detected as early as 5–6 weeks post￾implant, and a statistically significant stimulation above fasting
levels was first observed at 11–15 weeks. By 16–20 weeks post￾implant, statistically significant GSIS was observed within 5–
10 mins of glucose challenge, demonstrating maturation of the
functional glucose-responsive cell mass to a state exhibiting
dynamics akin to a first phase insulin response [26]. The group
of partially protected mice also exhibited increasing GSIS response
over time (Fig. S8C), and both groups combined exhibited an
average fasting serum C-peptide of 8886356 pM and a maximum
GSIS of 443062458 pM at 21–50 weeks (p,0.01). The 12 mice
(5%) that failed to exhibit function, or were sacrificed due to poor
health, were all in cohorts that otherwise exhibited high￾functioning animals, suggesting a failure of engraftment rather
than an inability of the implanted cells to differentiate and function
per se. Confounding technical and health-related issues attributed
to surgical complication, animal stress, fighting, or the onset of
SCID-associated thymoma [6], could all manifest as poor initial
engraftment, or reduced observable function. We also note that
each of these thirty-one scaled differentiations, derived from 5
different banks and produced by 6 different operators, generated
functional cells in vivo (Fig. S8), highlighting the robustness of the
manufacturing system.
To examine the therapeutic potential of the implanted,
functional pancreatic progenitors, we eliminated the endogenous
mouse b-cells at approximately 4–5 months after engraftment.
This was achieved using the b-cell toxin STZ [27] which exhibits
significantly greater cytotoxic activity against murine as compared
to human b-cells [28], [29]. We observed complete protection
from hyperglycemia post-STZ administration in each of the 15
animals tested and this protective effect was stable for .6 months
in the 6 mice maintained for that duration (Fig. 4B). Blood glucose
was maintained at or below 100 mg/dL (84.4617.3, n = 6 mice
(68 bleeds), 105–204 days post-STZ), indicating continued control
by human b-cells, which drive blood glucose to a lower set-point
than their mouse counterparts [30]. Hyperglycemia was observed
when the grafts were explanted, demonstrating that glucose
homeostasis was maintained by the implanted cells and not by
regeneration of mouse b-cells in the endogenous pancreas. These
findings were consistent with our previous analysis of the
functional capacity of mature pancreatic progenitor-derived grafts
in vivo [6].
Characterization of Pancreatic Grafts from Scaled
Differentiation Runs
Of the 240 mice implanted in this study, all grafts were maintained
in vivo for at least four months, and some for greater than 6 months
(n = 19 mice, 27 grafts). Measurement of grafts explanted at 16–52
weeks post-implant demonstrated that they were typically small with
a greatest dimension of 5.262.5 mm, although in some cases grafts
were larger due to the formation of cysts (mean 6 SD, n = 112 mice,
191 grafts; max = 15.0 mm; min = 2.0 mm; Fig. S9). The structure
and cellular composition of the implants were examined with
histological and immunofluorescent analyses (Fig. 5, Figs. S10, S11,

S12, S13, S14). The grafts contained large areas of endocrine clusters
surrounded bymouseconnectivetissueand occasional small, orlarge,
ductswith varying epithelialmorphologies (Fig. 5A,B; Figs. S10, S11,
S12, S13, S14). A subset of small and large grafts (n = 17) were
examined independently by a board-certified pathologist at
approximately 18 or 26 weeks post-implant. The pathologist
characterized the grafts as pancreatic tissue comprised of islets
and ducts, and noted that approximately half of these grafts
were cystic (Figs. S10, S11, S12, S13, S14). These cysts were
suggested to represent dilated pancreatic ducts. Immunofluores￾cence analyses supported the histological and physiological data.
Consistent with glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, the grafts
exhibited large clusters of insulin+ cells with PDX1+ and NKX6-
1+ nuclei (Fig. 5C–E). Cells immunoreactive for other pancreatic
hormones, including glucagon, somatostatin, ghrelin, and
pancreatic polypeptide were also observed (Fig. 5C, D; data
not shown). The grafts also occasionally displayed trypsin+
exocrine cells (Fig. 5F) and cytokeratin 19+
/PDX1+ ductal cells
(Fig. 5G), demonstrating the potential to generate all three
pancreatic lineages in vivo, as described previously [6], [7].

undifferentiated cells (POU5F1) were directed through mesendoderm (Brachyury: T), definitive endoderm (SOX17, CXCR4), primitive gut tube

These cell components were confirmed to be derived from the
implanted cells as determined by staining for a human nuclear
specific antigen (Fig. 5G, data not shown). The histological and
immunofluorescent analyses therefore indicated that the grafts
were predominantly comprised of endodermal derivatives,
principally pancreatic tissues.
Discussion
We report here an integrated manufacturing process for a
hESC-based therapeutic candidate for type 1 diabetes using the
CyT49 cell line (Fig. 6). High-density, single cell banks of CyT49
were thawed and expanded with efficient population doublings.
Expanded cultures were aggregated in suspension, generating
uniform clusters of undifferentiated cells, which were then
differentiated in suspension en masse. An optimized 4-stage
protocol directed the stepwise formation of highly enriched
pancreatic populations that functioned robustly in vivo. The
process integrates a standardized cell source and scaled differen￾tiation with the ability to cryopreserve the end-stage pancreatic
aggregates so that function is retained in vivo (not shown). This
provides the critical ability to test function and safety of scaled
manufactured lots, prior to pre-clinical studies or clinical
application. Our approach represents the first demonstration of
a practical system for manufacturing a hESC-based treatment for
type 1 diabetes, mitigating many of the perceived hurdles to
clinical development.
In contrast to previous reports of cGMP banking of clinically￾relevant hESC lines, which by necessity relied on earlier clump￾passaging methodologies [31], our single-cell suspension cGMP
MCB/WCB are a starting point for acute scaled expansion for
producing large batches of pancreatic progenitors. WCB4B vials
could theoretically be thawed on a monthly basis, generating
batches of .1010 cells each month, and at that rate would provide
starting material for more than 20 years of manufacturing. If
exhausted, additional WCBs derived from MCB4 could be

generated as required. Our strategy also minimizes the potential
for karyotypic drift in euploid hESC cultures [17], [32], as banked
cells are only expanded for 3–6 passages over a 15–20 day period
before differentiation. It is notable that while theoretical consid￾erations implicate population size as a risk factor in accumulating
aneuploidies in hESC cultures [33], our conditions could support

Figure 6. Schematic representation of the manufacturing process for pancreatic progenitors. Scaled and high-density single-cell master
(MCB) and working cell banks (WCB) of CyT49 cells were prepared with cGMP and serve as a virtually unlimited source of starting material for
differentiation. Cryopreserved vials of 107 CyT49 cells from a qualified working cell bank are thawed and expanded in adherent culture conditions for
4 or 5 passages over a 2-week period. A single cell suspension is harvested and aggregated in rotational culture in 6-well trays. After 24 hrs the hESC
aggregates are differentiated en masse with the 4-stage protocol to a population of pancreatic progenitors. For clinical development, scaled lots of
differentiated aggregates will be produced with cGMP and cryopreserved, enabling a proportion of each lot to be tested for safety, efficacy and other
regulatory considerations. Qualified lots of differentiated pancreatic progenitors will be thawed, recovered, formulated, loaded into a durable
immunoisolation device and delivered for preclinical or clinical studies. The manufacturing process is amenable to further scaling via additional
passages in adherent culture, as well as aggregation and differentiation in larger vessels.

the expansion of euploid cells on a clinical-manufacturing scale.
The simplicity of this expansion system for CyT49 is also likely to
be amenable to automation.
Aggregation of undifferentiated hESC in dynamic rotational
suspension culture is a unique methodology. Current examples of
suspension culture of hESC use aggregates generated from
collagenase passaging [34], shear of suspension clusters [35], in
static culture conditions [34], require microcarrier support [36],
[37], [38], [39], or heat shock in combination with the ROCK
inhibitor Y27632 to support aggregation and survival [40]. Such
limitations add hurdles to maintaining cells in an undifferentiated
state, the ability to scale and automate, or support effective
population expansion in the face of passaging inefficiencies.
Conversely, we have demonstrated that uniform clusters of
undifferentiated hESC could be aggregated with high incorpora￾tion efficiencies in rotational culture, by taking advantage of the
inherent self-associative properties of hESC. The particular
conditions we optimized were critical for effective aggregation,
as the circular movement imposed a shallow central vortex
drawing cells into a high local density in the middle of each well.
The epithelial characteristics of undifferentiated hESC, presum￾ably E-cadherin expression in particular [41], may mediate
effective self-association of cells as they collide [42]. Aggregates
did not form efficiently in static suspension culture, rocked, or
stirred cultures, or even in centrifuged cell pellets (not shown),
indicating that fluid movement and limited shear forces played an
important role in transitioning cell-cell contact into stable
adhesion, a well characterized phenomenon [43]. The ability to
serially passage aggregates of euploid hESC in dynamic rotational
culture suggests that future manufacturing processes may also
utilize scaling of hESC cultures in such a format.
The pairing of scaled expansion of CyT49 in adherent culture
with aggregation and differentiation en masse is also a novel
strategy. Effective step-wise lineage specification en route to
pancreatic cell types was achieved by adapting our previous
adherent-based system to dynamic suspension culture. This
approach is essentially unrelated to traditional embryoid body
differentiation, which is stochastic at best and not capable of
directing uniform specification. Our strategy is also conceptually
different from efforts to expand endoderm intermediates such as
DE [11]. In the present method, differentiation was directed in a
highly controlled manner and resulted in consistency and
uniformity of cellular composition superior to that we reported
previously. In contrast to differentiation of hESC in adherent
culture, which in our hands appears to be sensitive to variations in
local densities, hESC aggregates by their very nature have high
and uniform local cellular density, which may exert a positive
influence on the uniformity of pancreatic differentiation. We
demonstrated with our previous methods that multiple hESC lines
could be differentiated to pancreatic lineages [5], [6], [7],
including CyT203-derived glucose responsive, insulin secreting
cells in vivo [6]. Furthermore, others have recently generated
functional grafts from the WA1 hESC line [44]. Given the likely
requirement for cell line-specific optimization of culture conditions
and timing [5], [6], it is reasonable to expect that these suspension
methodologies could be applied to other pluripotent cell lines. The
mechano-physical properties of the cellular microenvironment are
also likely to be quite different in suspension as compared to
adherent conditions, which may also contribute to consistency of
cell fate determination. We have achieved defined cell composi￾tions without the requirement for cell sorting and the associated
poor yields that accompany it [7], although sorting of the
dissociated Stage-4 aggregates to enrich PE or endocrine cells
for profiling analyses was achieved using CD142 and CD200,
respectively (data not shown). Furthermore, for a cellular therapy
based on implanting pancreatic lineages, the use of cellular
aggregates offers a significant advantage over microcarrier-based
suspension technologies. Pancreatic aggregates can be implanted
without disrupting the maturing cellular architecture, avoiding
substantial losses that would occur when harvesting from
microcarriers.
The manufacturing process we have developed serves as a
foundation for additional scaling, development of conditions for
cGMP manufacturing and production of qualified material for
preclinical and clinical studies. The Edmonton protocol calls for a
patient dose of 10,000 islet equivalents (IEQ)/kg body weight to
achieve the primary endpoint of insulin independence [45]. A
projected dose suggests that a large number of hESC-derived
pancreatic progenitors will be required for clinical application,
estimated to be a minimum of 108 cells/patient [7]. A sensitivity
analysis of the scale required to enter a phase 1 clinical trial needs
to account for the number of patients, absolute doses to be tested,
amount of product utilized in quality control testing, and
efficiencies at each step of the manufacturing process (Fig. 6).
Given the assumptions that can be made for each variable and
allowing for the range within these may fall, we can speculate that
a batch of somewhere between 2.56109 and 3.361010 CyT49 cells
will be necessary to generate sufficient cell product for a phase 1
clinical trial of ten patients at a dose of 108 cells/patient. In this
report we have demonstrated the ability to reach the lower end of
this predictive window using our current technology. A single vial
of 107 cells was thawed, expanded over two weeks, and
differentiated to produce pancreatic aggregates of 3.36109 cells,
which functioned appropriately in vivo (data not shown). The upper
end of this prediction is also well within reach, as additional
passages in multilayer chambers are neither technically difficult
nor approaching the limit of the technology. A single 40-stack cell
factory has a surface area of 25,000 cm2
, which conservatively
would yield .6.26109 CyT49 cells under our present conditions.
Given the progress in automating hESC expansion with robotics,
the application of hESC expansion in suspension culture, or the
logical adaptation of differentiation to controlled, expandable, and
closed bioreactor manufacturing systems, we anticipate that we
will be able to increase the scale of our process by several
additional orders of magnitude.
Assessing the consistency that could be achieved with a
scalable manufacturing process for hESC-derived pancreatic
progenitors was the primary objective of this study. CyT49
could be differentiated with high reproducibility using an
optimized process, achieving robust function in vivo. In
concordance with our previous reports, we generated pancreatic
grafts that could sense blood glucose and respond by releasing
human insulin [6], [7]. The grafts differentiated and matured
over time, as shown by the statistically significant increase in
baseline and amplitude of response observed after week 10, and
significant 5 to 10 min GSIS response at weeks 16–50.
Critically, grafts could maintain blood glucose homeostasis in
an endogenous b-cell ablation model. The combination of
scaled differentiation and functional outcome in hundreds of
animals represents an experimental magnitude far greater than
previously reported, with reproducibility that enables progres￾sion to formal preclinical development. We envision developing
an allo-compatible neo-pancreatic product, by engrafting
pancreatic progenitors within a vascularizing and durable
immunoisolation, or macroencapsulation, device.
Suspension-based pancreatic differentiation runs consistently
yielded only minimal amounts of non-pancreatic tissue upon
implantation, in contrast with the variability in teratoma rates

displayed in our previous reports [6], [7]. Nonetheless, some
grafts also contained dilated ducts and/or cysts derived from
these ducts. While not a particular safety concern pathologically,
an enlarged cyst could potentially impinge upon surrounding
tissue. Cell implantation within a durable macroencapsulation
device could potentially constrain such structures, and offer an
additional level of safety by enabling retrievability of implanted
cells. In any format, formal demonstration of product safety
requires both regulated preclinical studies, and eventual batch
release qualification of cryopreserved material produced under
cGMP.
In summary, we have assembled and demonstrated the utility of
a system for the manufacturing of a functional hESC-based
therapeutic product for type 1 diabetes. Our approach coordinates
many discrete steps into a highly regulated process, linking a scaled
and standardized cell source with expansion and scalable
differentiation, through to qualification in vivo. The process
generates implantable material with reproducibility and the
compatibility required for industrialization.

Care and Use Committee, protocol #VC-02-09-148.
Undifferentiated hESC Culture
The CyT49 hESC line ([6], NIH registration number: 0041)
was used in these studies. Xeno-free growth media (XF HA)
consisted of DMEM/F12 containing GlutaMAX (Life Technol￾ogies, cat#10565) supplemented with 10% (v/v) of Xeno-free
KnockOut Serum Replacement (Life Technologies, cat#12618-
001), 1% (v/v) non-essential amino acids (Life Technologies,
cat#11140-050), 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Life Technologies,
cat#21985-023), 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technol￾ogies, cat#15070-063), 10 ng/mL heregulin-1b (Peprotech,
cat#100-03) and 10 ng/mL activin A (R&D Systems, cat#338-
AC). Upon thaw, or at regular passaging, dissociated hESC were
plated at 50,000 or 33,000 cells/cm2 for three and four day growth
cycles, respectively. On the day of plating only, cell attachment
was facilitated by including 10% (v/v) of non-heat inactivated
human AB serum (Valley Biomedical, cat#HP1022). A standard￾ized plating volume of 0.2 mL/cm2 was used for different tissue
culture plates, T-flasks and cell factories. The volume of growth
media used was increased for each additional day of feeding
according to Methods S1, and did not include human serum. On
the day of passaging, cultures were fed with fresh growth media
and cultured 4–8 hrs before dissociation. Cultures were washed
with PBS (Life Technologies, cat#10010-031) and dissociated for
6 mins at 37uC using pre-warmed Accutase (Innovative Cell
Technologies, cat# AT104). Dissociated cells were gently
collected using 36volume of cold hESC media (without heregulin
or activin), counted using a ViCell automated cell counter (BD
Biosciences), or a hemocytometer, centrifuged for 5 mins at 2006
g and the pellet resuspended in fresh growth media at 1–106106
cells/mL for subsequent plating. Where indicated, the StemPro
hESC SFM medium (Life Technologies, cat#A1000701) supple￾mented with 10 ng/mL heregulin-1b, 10 ng/mL activin A,
10 ng/mL FGF2 and 200 ng/mL LR3
-IGF1 (StemPro), or the
same media without FGF2 (SP HAI) were used for hESC culture
or suspension culture. Cell culture was performed in humidified
incubators at 37uC and 8% CO2.
Cryopreservation and Banking of hESC
Small and large-scale single-cell banks were cryopreserved using
the same approach, essentially as described previously [46].
Adherent cell cultures were harvested according to the above
passaging protocol, pooled and counted. Cell pellets were
resuspended in prewarmed 50% hESC culture medium (without
growth factors)/50% human serum. An equal volume of 80%
hESC culture medium (without growth factors)/20% DMSO was
added drop-wise, with swirling. 1 mL of cells was distributed to
1.8 mL Nunc cryovials for freezing at 280uC in Nalgene Mr
Frosty containers for 24 hrs, before transferring to liquid N2.
cGMP culture and banking were performed by Viacyte employees
at a certified 3rd party contract research organization.
Aggregate Formation and Differentiation
Scaled pancreatic differentiation runs in suspension typically
utilized 18–20 6-well trays and were carried out by first generating
hESC aggregates. On the fourth day after passage adherent hESC
cultures were fed with fresh XF HA media and cultured 4–8 hrs
before dissociation. Cultures were harvested according to the
passaging protocol and resuspended in approximately 10 mL cold
XF HA media per 150 cm2 culture surface area. Cells were
counted using a ViCell automated cell counter, then seeded into
ultra-low adhesion 6-well trays (Greiner BioOne, cat#657185) at
16106 cells/mL in XF HA media and 5.5 mL per well. The 6-well
trays were incubated at 37uC on orbital rotators set at 95 rpm
(Innova2000, New Brunswick Scientific). During overnight
culture, single cells aggregated to form spherical clusters approx￾imately 100–200 mm in diameter (Figs. S4, S5) and roughly 5,000
aggregates per well. The differentiation media and rotation
conditions used for each day are detailed in Methods S1. To
initiate differentiation, aggregates were pooled into conical tube(s)
and allowed to settle by gravity, or in some experiments by
centrifugation at 500 rpm for 90 seconds, followed by a wash using
Stage-1 media without growth factors. The aggregates were re￾settled, then resuspended in day 1 media and evenly redistributed
to the same number of wells using new 6-well trays in 5.5 mL total
volume per well. After 20–24 hrs of differentiation some cell death
and a wispy mass, or clump, of DNA was visible in each well (Fig.
S5A). On this day, clumps were disrupted by triturating with a
P200 pipettor and returned to the rotator for 30 seconds to allow
aggregates to collect in the center of the well. Approximately
4.5 mL of media was aspirated from each well and wells were fed
with 4.5 mL of day 2 media. Aspiration of 4.5 mL of media
followed by feeding with 4.5 mL of the subsequent day’s media
was performed daily thereafter. In some experiments, at the end of
Stage-2 the aggregates were pooled and redistributed to half the
original number of wells in 5.5 mL of day 5 media. Aggregates
were sampled at the indicated time points for histological,
immunofluorescence, and gene expression analyses.
Digital Gene Expression Analysis
Total RNA was isolated from triplicate samples using the 6100
nucleic acid extractor (Applied Biosystems; Foster City, CA) and
100 ng used per reaction for quantitation of gene expression using
the nCounter System [25] according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Nanostring; Seattle, WA). The raw count data were
normalized to the count data from internal control sequences
(‘‘spikes’’). After spike-normalization, the data were normalized to
the count data from four different housekeeping genes using
geometric means of the spike-normalized counts for ACTB,
POLR2A, PPIG, and TBP. The average and standard deviations
of the fully normalized counts were calculated for three biological
replicates.

Flow cytometric analyses were conducted essentially as

Buffer (Miltenyi Biotec #130-091-221) was added and the
suspension was passed through a 40–100 mm filter and pelleted.
For surface marker staining, dissociated cells were incubated with
fluorescent-conjugated antibody diluted in MACS Separation
Buffer for 20 mins and then washed in MACS Separation Buffer.
Following dissociation, and in some cases surface marker staining,
cells were fixed for 30 mins in 4% (wt/v) paraformaldehyde,
washed in FACS Buffer (PBS, 0.1% (wt/v) BSA, 0.1% (wt/v)
NaN3) and stored in IC Buffer (PBS, 1% (wt/v) BSA, 0.1% (wt/v)
NaN3). For intracellular staining cells were permeabilized with
Perm Buffer (PBS, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 5% (v/v) normal
donkey serum, 0.1% (wt/v) NaN3) for 30 mins on ice and then
washed with IC buffer. Cells were incubated with primary
antibodies diluted with Block Buffer (PBS, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X￾100, 5% (v/v) normal donkey serum, 0.1% (wt/v) NaN3) overnight
at 4uC. Cells were washed in IC buffer and then incubated with
appropriate secondary antibodies for 60 mins at 4uC. Cells were
washed with IC Buffer and then in FACS Buffer. Cells were
resuspended in FACS buffer for flow acquisition. Antibodies and
dilutions used for staining are detailed in Methods S1. Flow
cytometry data were acquired as described previously [7] with a
FACSCaliburTM (BD Biosciences), using excitation lines at
488 nm and 635 nm and detecting fluorescence at 530615 nm,
585621 nm, and 66168 nm. Data were analyzed using FlowJo
software (Tree Star, Inc.). Intact cells were identified based on
forward (low angle) and side (orthogonal, 90u) light scatter. To
account for the varying levels of autofluorescence observed in
these complex samples, additional gating of intact cells (2–3 sub￾populations) was performed and cells were subsequently analyzed
for fluorescence intensity. Background was estimated using
unstained, secondary-antibody alone, or irrelevant antibody
controls, as appropriate. In figures, a representative flow cytometry
plot is shown from one of the sub-populations. Numbers reported
on plots and in tables represent the percentage of total cells from
the intact cells gate.
Graft Preparation and Implantation
Pancreatic populations were grafted to the EFP as described
previously [6]. Most aggregates were collected and prepared at
day 12 of differentiation, while some were maintained in Stage-4
medium until d14 or d16 before preparation. Briefly, the
aggregates were allowed to settle by gravity and 5 mL of cell
aggregate slurry (representing 1.56106 cells) was transferred onto
6 mm diameter by 0.8–1.0 mm thick gelatin foam disks
(VetsponH. Novartis Animal Health US, Inc, cat#96001) that
were prewetted with RPMI 1640 with 2% (v/v) FBS. The
implantable constructs were transferred to culture dishes with pre￾warmed medium until implantation, typically the same day. For
implantation surgery, male SCID/Bg mice (Harlan) 6–13 wks of
age were anesthetized by intra-peritoneal injection of an anesthetic
cocktail (90 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg of xylazine) and
abdomens were shaved and swabbed with povidone iodine
solution. A 1-cm midline incision was made through both skin
and abdominal muscle layers, and one of the EFP was carefully
externalized through the incision and placed on a saline￾dampened gauze pad. A single implant construct was wrapped
in the EFP and fixed in place with a small amount of veterinary
tissue adhesive (VetBond, 3 M, cat#1469SB) and the EFP was
returned to the abdominal cavity. The procedure was typically
repeated on the contralateral EFP, for a total of two implant
constructs per mouse. Absorbable suture were used to close the
abdominal wall and wound clips were used to close the skin
incision.
Glucose Stimulated Insulin Secretion (GSIS) Assays
Starting from 35 days, but typically at about 42–56 days post￾implantation, graft function was assessed by performing measure￾ment of serum human C-peptide in response to glucose
administration. Prior to the GSIS assay, mice were fasted for
approximately 15–18 hrs. Glucose was administered via intra￾peritoneal injection of a 30% dextrose solution at a dose of 3.0 g/
kg body weight, and blood was collected prior to (fasting) and at
combinations of 5, 10, 30, or 60 mins after glucose administration.
Blood samples of approximately 20–40 mL were collected by retro￾orbital sinus puncture and transferred to microtainer tubes (BD
Biosciences, cat#365956) containing blood/serum separation gel.
Serum was collected after spinning these tubes at 1000–20006 g
for 5–10 mins. The ELISA used for human C-peptide (Mercodia
Ultrasensitive Human C-peptide ELISA, cat#10-1141-01) was the
same as used previously [6], [7]. We regard the lower limit of
accurate quantitation of human C-peptide in serum samples to be
50 pM [6]. The level of cross-detection of mouse C-peptide is
,1%, or a maximum of 30 pM in glucose-stimulated control
mice. The level of cross-detection of human insulin is ,0.0006%
and ,1.8% for proinsulin.
Streptozotocin (STZ) Treatment of Mice
Mice received 70 mg STZ (Sigma-Aldrich, cat#S0130) per kg
body weight, through intra-peritoneal injection on five consecutive
days for a total dose of 350 mg/kg as described previously [6].
Under these conditions non-implanted animals typically reach
blood glucose levels greater than 300 mg/dL, indicating depletion
of endogenous b-cells [6]. For blood glucose measurements, tail
vein samples were tested using glucometers specifically calibrated
for measuring rodent blood glucose values (Alpha-Trak gluc￾ometer and Omnistrips, Abbott Animal Health #32004-05 and
#32006-05).
Statistical Analyses
One-way ANOVA was performed for all statistical analyses
using the StatPlus package for Excel (AnalystSoft, Alexandria,
VA), with p,0.01 considered significant.
Histopathological Analysis
Grafts from mice were explanted and fixed in 10% neutral
buffered formalin for paraffin embedded blocks, and in 4% (wt/v)
paraformaldehyde for 4 hrs in 4uC for frozen blocks, followed by
washing with PBS for 3 hrs and then equilibration in 30% sucrose
at 4uC overnight. Samples of cell aggregates were made into
frozen blocks by fixing with 4% (wt/v) paraformaldehyde for
30 mins and then with 30% sucrose at 4uC overnight. The
paraffin embedded specimens were sectioned at 5 mm and OCT
compound mounted frozen blocks were sectioned at 8 mm.
Standard histological hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining were
performed on both graft and cell aggregates. The H&E images
were captured by a Nanozoomer digital slide scanner (Olympus
Inc.). Immunofluorescence analyses of aggregates and grafts were
performed as described previously [5], [6], [7], [41]. The
antibodies used are detailed in Methods S1. Images were acquired
with a confocal microscope (Nikon, Eclipse 80i, Ci).

expansion. (A) Phase contrast images of single-cell passaged
CyT49 at six time points after plating. Single plated cells (3 hr)
migrate to form micro-colonies (d1), which proliferate to form a
near confluent monolayer of hESC (d5). (B) Cell counts of serially
passaged CyT49 cells in xeno-free culture media confirmed that
addition of FGF2 was not required for long-term self-renewal
under these conditions (XF HA vs XF HAF). A control condition
(SR AF HS), which also supports self-renewal of undifferentiated
hESC (data not shown) was included. The base media was
DMEM/F12, and the cultures were passaged with Accutase and
maintained in 6-well trays. XF: 10% xeno-free serum replacer,
SR: 20% knockout serum replacer, H: 10 ng/mL heregulin-1b, A:
10 ng/mL Activin A, F: 10 ng/mL FGF2, HS: 10% soluble-phase

Figure S2 Optimization of the feeder-free culture
system for scaled expansion of CyT49. (A) Determination
of the cell yield 1–6 days after plating with three different densities
(0.66, 1.0, or 1.56106 cells/60 mm dish, or 3.3, 5.0, or 7.66104
cells/cm2
, respectively) demonstrated that near-exponential ex￾pansion occurred for the first four days. In comparison to a plot of
theoretical-low expansion (plating 0.56106 cells/60 mm dish,
24 hr population doubling), the cell yield did not continue to
increase after day four. Slowing of expansion was detected earliest,
and was most prominent at, the highest plating density, suggesting
that culture confluence may restrict further yield increases. These
studies contributed to electing to use densities of 56104 cells/cm2
for a 3-day culture interval, and 3.36104 cells/cm2 for a 4-day
culture interval during large-scale processes. (B) Pre-feeding of
cultures prior to passaging improves plating efficiency. Cultures
were fed with fresh media for 1, 2, 4, or 8 hrs prior to passaging
(n = 2 dishes per time point). A moderate increase in cell yield was
observed with pre-feeding (grey columns, left axis), as well as in
plating efficiency (black bars, right axis). Plating efficiencies were
determined by counting cultures 24 hrs post-plating. (C) The
duration of Accutase dissociation was standardized to a 6-minute
exposure by determining that it supported effective plating
efficiencies for both pre-fed and non pre-fed cultures compared
to a 4-, or 8-minute treatment. (D) In order to reduce the number
of handling steps in scaled-expansion processes, we demonstrated
that Accutase could still disaggregate cultures effectively if it was
added, then immediately aspirated from vessels. The residual
activity (‘‘aspirated accutase’’) was sufficient to disaggregate
cultures and provide a plating efficiency of .85%. The plating
efficiency of cultures grown in 60 mm dishes, pre-fed for 7 hrs,
and then exposed to aspirated Accutase for 4, 6, 8, or 10 minutes
are shown, as is a control plate passaged with standard Accutase
treatment for 6-minutes (Cont.).

efficiencies were estimated after 24 hrs by two methods. First,
counting the number of live unincorporated cells and extrapolat￾ing, indicated that 7263.2% and 7661.5% of input cells were
incorporated (% Inc.) for XF HA and SP HAI conditions,
respectively (mean 6 SD, n = 3). Secondly, cell counts of
dissociated aggregates (d1) indicated that they contained
63.562.2% and 98.9610.1% of input cells for XF HA and SP
HAI conditions, respectively. After 3 days of expansion (d3)
aggregates contained 162.4614.7% and 248.7612.7% of input
cells for XF HA and SP HAI conditions, respectively. (E)

conditions). Markers shown in kD. (K–N) The ability to maintain
hESC in suspension culture was demonstrated by serially
passaging CyT49 aggregates in XF HA media for 10 passages.
Cultures were passaged by dissociating aggregates to single cells,
and re-aggregating in rotational culture. No spontaneous differ￾entiation was observed. Cells were subsequently plated in adherent
culture for immunofluorescence analysis, and exhibited uniform
expression of (K) OCT4 and (L) TRA-1-81 after 10 passages (,2
months) in suspension culture. Matched 49,6-diamidino-2-pheny￾lindole (DAPI) staining images are shown in the right panels in

-
IGF1, 10 ng/mL HRG and 10 ng/mL ActA. Suspension
aggregates retained robust expresson of markers of pluriptency
(POU5F1/OCT4, NANOG and SOX2), but did not express
appreciable levels of markers upregulated during differentiation
(Eomes, MIXL1, CXCR4, SOX17, HNF1B, HNF4A). Differen￾tiating aggregates at Stage-1 (d2) and Stage-2 (d5) were included as
controls. Fold values are plotted relative to the XF HA sample.
These data suggest that hESC could be incorporated efficiently
into aggregates, expanded, and serially-passaged as euploid
undifferentiated cells. Similar results were observed using BG02
(not shown). Suspension aggregates could also be differentiatiated
to representatives of all three germ layers in teratomas in
immunocompromised mice (not shown). Scale bars: 200 mm (A–
C), 100 mm (F,G), 50 mm (H,I,K,L).
