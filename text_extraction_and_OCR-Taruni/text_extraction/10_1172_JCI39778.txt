Although several cytokines and neurotrophic factors induce sympathetic neurons to transdifferentiate into
cholinergic neurons in vitro, the physiological and pathophysiological roles ofthis remain unknown. During
congestive heartfailure (CHF), sympathetic neural tone is upregulated, but there is a paradoxical reduction in
norepinephrine synthesis and reuptake in the cardiac sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Here we examined
whether cholinergic transdifferentiation can occur in the cardiac SNS in rodent models ofCHF and investigat￾ed the underlying molecular mechanism(s) using genetically modified mice. We used Dahl salt-sensitive rats
to model CHF and found that, upon CHF induction, the cardiac SNS clearly acquired cholinergic characteris￾tics. Of the various cholinergic differentiation factors, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and cardiotrophin-1
were strongly upregulated in the ventricles of rats with CHF. Further, LIF and cardiotrophin-1 secreted from
cultured failing rat cardiomyocytes induced cholinergic transdifferentiation in cultured sympathetic neurons,
and this process was reversed by siRNAs targeting Lif and cardiotrophin-1. Consistent with the data in rats,
heart-specific overexpression of LIF in mice caused cholinergic transdifferentiation in the cardiac SNS. Fur￾ther, SNS-specific targeting ofthe gene encoding the gp130 subunit ofthe receptor for LIF and cardiotrophin-1
in mice prevented CHF-induced cholinergic transdifferentiation. Cholinergic transdifferentiation was also
observed in the cardiac SNS of autopsied patients with CHF. Thus, CHF causes target-dependent cholinergic
transdifferentiation of the cardiac SNS via gp130-signaling cytokines secreted from the failing myocardium.
Introduction
Cardiac function is tightly controlled by the balance between 
the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the parasympathetic 
nervous system (PNS). The SNS produces norepinephrine (NE) 
and increases the heart rate, conduction velocity, and myocardial 
contraction and relaxation, while the PNS produces acetylcho￾line (Ach) that reduces cardiac performance. In congestive heart 
failure (CHF), sympathetic neural tone is upregulated, and excess 
SNS activation leads to pathophysiological effects, such as myo￾cardial damage, decline of cardiac function, and lethal arrhyth￾mia (1, 2), and also causes depletion of cardiac NE content (3). 
This depletion of NE in CHF has been considered to be the result 
of excess NE secretion, disturbance of NE reuptake, and loss of 
noradrenergic nerve terminals (4, 5). However, we recently report￾ed that the attenuation of NE in CHF was caused by downregula￾tion of NE synthesis, concomitant with the reduced NE reuptake 
(6). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the reduc￾tion in catecholaminergic characteristics of cardiac SNS in CHF 
remain poorly understood.
Neurotrophic factors that are secreted by the target organ and 
their target-derived retrograde signals are essential for the develop￾ment and differentiation of neurons and well as for neuronal diversi￾fication and acquisition of neuronal properties (7). Previous studies 
have established that leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a member of 
the IL-6 cytokine family, can induce cultured sympathetic neurons 
to switch neurotransmitters, from NE to Ach (8). Fukada purified a 
cholinergic differentiation factor from cultured rat heart cells that 
can induce neurotransmitter switching from NE to Ach in cultured 
sympathetic neurons (9, 10), and Yamamori confirmed that this 
factor was identical to LIF (11). LIF can induce neurotransmitter 
switching in vitro and in vivo. Although sweat glands are innervated 
by catecholaminergic sympathetic nerves at birth, the switch of neu￾rotransmitter from catecholamine to Ach occurs gradually during 
development (7). Sympathetic neuron-specific gene targeting of 
gp130, an IL-6 cytokine family receptor, revealed that sympathetic 
nerves do not undergo cholinergic differentiation in the sweat gland 
(12). Studies in transgenic mice overexpressing LIF in pancreas 
show that the catecholaminergic characteristics decline, while the 
cholinergic characteristics increase (13). These results demonstrate 
that LIF/gp130 signaling plays an essential role in cholinergic neu￾rotransmitter switching in sympathetic nerves.

CHF leads to upregulation of a range of growth factors and 
cytokines in the heart (14). LIF and other members of the IL-6 
family, which can induce fetal gene expression (so-called rejuve￾nation) in adult cardiomyocytes, are upregulated during CHF 
(15, 16). In cardiac SNS in CHF, we also observed strong expres￾sion of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43) and highly polys￾ialylated neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM), which 
are immature neuronal markers expressed specifically in the 
fetal SNS. This result suggests that cardiac SNS dysfunction is 
accompanied by neuronal rejuvenation (6). To further under￾stand the precise pathophysiological molecular mechanism, we 
investigated the relationship between phenotype and paracrine 
factors in failing myocardium.
In the present study, we show that cardiac SNS in CHF in 
human hearts and animal models, can cause neurotransmitter 
switching and transdifferentiation from catecholaminergic into 
cholinergic neurons, and this process is induced by gp130-medi￾ated signaling via cholinergic differentiation factors released 
from failing myocardium.
Results
Distribution of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves in the rat heart. 
We first defined the sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation 
of the rat heart. Immunostaining of LVs for tyrosine hydroxylase 
(TH) and choline transporter (CHT) was performed as a catechol￾aminergic and cholinergic nerve marker, respectively. TH-immu￾nopositive (TH+) nerves were abundant in LVs, with greater inner￾vation of the subepicardium (Figure 1, A and B) as we previously 
reported (17). CHT+ nerves were fewer in number than TH+ nerves, 
and their density was not different between myocardial layers (Fig￾ure 1, A and C). The thick and fasciculated nerve fibers at the epi￾cardial surface expressed TH but not CHT (Figure 1A).

In cardiac SNS, preganglionic and postganglionic synapses 
occur mainly in the stellate ganglia and partially in the upper tho￾racic ganglia. The vast majority of neurons in the stellate ganglia 
were TH+, and a few coexpressed choline acetyltransferase (ChAT, 
a cholinergic nerve marker). In contrast, almost all neurons in the 
cardiac ganglia were ChAT+, with a few expressing TH (Figure 1D). 
Thus, catecholaminergic sympathetic innervation is predominant 
in LVs, and the cardiac SNS and PNS extend from the neurons in 
stellate and cardiac ganglia, respectively.
Cardiac sympathetic nerve fibers show an increase in cholinergic marker–
positive neurons in Dahl salt-sensitive rat ventricles. In Dahl salt-sensitive 
(DS) rats, high salt intake causes hypertension, cardiac hypertro￾phy, fibrosis, and DS rats are a common model of CHF. To deter￾mine whether cardiac innervation is altered in CHF, we analyzed 
sympathetic neuronal function in DS rats and the control Dahl 
salt-resistant (DR) rats (control). DS rats showed elevated blood 
pressure and heart rate as well as pleural effusion (Supplemental

doi:10.1172/JCI39778DS1). DS rats demonstrated heart-to-body 
weight ratios that were 1.7-fold higher than those for DR rats at 
15 weeks (Supplemental Figure 1A) and also showed dilated LVs 
and reduced fractional shortening (Supplemental Table 2). DS rats 
also showed elevated brain natri￾uretic peptide (BNP) expression 
and plasma NE concentrations but 
significantly lower cardiac NE con￾centrations, consistent with CHF 
(Supplemental Figure 1, B–D).
Triple-immunostaining revealed 
that DS LVs had fewer catechol￾aminergic nerves (TH+) and more 
cholinergic nerves (CHT+) than 
DR LVs (Supplemental Figure 
1E). The epicardial sympathetic 
nerve bundles in DS rats show a 
marked increase in CHT+ nerves 
and a marked decrease in TH+
nerves compared with DR rats (Fig￾ure 2A and Supplemental Figure 
2, A and B). Coexpression of CHT 
was observed in some TH+ nerves. 
In DR rats, the majority of these 
fibers express TH (TH+/neurofila￾ment+ [TH+/NF+] ratio, 84%), and 
a small proportion coexpress CHT 
(CHT+/NF+ ratio, 3%). In contrast, 
DS rats had markedly more CHT+
nerves (CHT+/NF+ ratio, 21%) and 
fewer TH+ nerves (TH+/NF+ ratio, 
39%) than DR rats (Figure 2, B 
and C). Double immunostaining 
for calcitonin gene-related peptide 
(a sensory nerve marker) and NF 
revealed that the density of sensory 
nerves in the LV of DS rats was not 
significantly different from that 
observed in DR rats (Supplemental 
Figure 2, C and D). We also per￾formed double immunostaining 
for NF and dopamine β-hydroxy￾lase (DBH), another marker for 
sympathetic nerves (Supplemental 
Figure 3A). We found fewer cat￾echolaminergic (DBH+) nerves in 
both the LV and stellate ganglia in 
DS rats than in DR rats. This result 
is consistent with our findings 
from TH immunostaining. These 
changes occur gradually with the 
progression of cardiac hypertrophy 
to CHF (Supplemental Figure 4). 
Taken together, these results show 
that markers of cholinergic signal￾ing are increased in DS rats, and 
some cardiac sympathetic nerve 
fibers contain both catecholamin￾ergic and cholinergic properties in 
the LV of DS rats.
Stellate ganglia neurons in rats with heart failure have predominantly 
cholinergic activity. Next, we investigated the expression of specific 
markers in the stellate ganglia. DR rats showed many TH+ and 
DBH+ neurons, a few ChAT+ neurons, and many ChAT+ presyn￾Figure 3

aptic nerve fibers. By comparison, DS rats had more abundant 
ChAT+ neurons, some of which coexpressed TH and DBH (Figure 
2, D and E, and Supplemental Figure 3B). CHT (Cht1) and vesicu￾lar Ach transporter (VAChT) expressions were also significantly 
higher (1.9-fold and 6.6-fold higher, respectively) in the stellate 
ganglia of DS rats (Figure 2, F and G). This shift toward choliner￾gic activity in DS rats was specific to the superior cervical, stellate, 
and upper thoracic ganglia. Lower thoracic and lumbar ganglia 
had no detectable ChAT expression (Supplemental Figure 5). 
Taken together, the cholinergic transdifferentiation of the cardiac 
SNS in CHF occurs not only at the peripheral axons but also the 
neuronal bodies themselves.
Functional evidence that the cardiac sympathetic nerves of DS rats switch 
from catecholaminergic to cholinergic activity. To confirm that the car￾diac SNS undergoes a functional change from catecholaminergic 
to cholinergic activity, we labeled the cardiac SNS anterogradely 
from the stellate ganglia by injection of biotinylated dextran amine 
(BDA), an anterograde neuronal tracer. Both the sympathetic neu￾rons in the stellate ganglia and the projecting nerve fibers were 
labeled with BDA (Figure 3A and Supplemental Figure 6A). In the 
LV of DR rats, all neurons injected with BDA+ expressed TH (data 
not shown), whereas some other neurons either expressed TH or 
CHT in DS rats (Figure 3B).
Furthermore, direct observation of the nerve endings of the 
SNS by transmission electron microscopy showed that many 
small granular vesicles (SGVs, involving catecholamine) were 
observed in DR rats, consistent with previous studies (18), 
whereas the nerve endings in DS rats had both SGVs and small 
agranular vesicles (SAGVs, involving Ach) (Figure 3C and Sup￾plemental Figure 6B). Quantification of the percentage of SGVs, 
found using the formula (SGV/[SGV + SAVG]), revealed that a 
substantial subset of cardiac SNS undergo partial transdifferen￾tiation (Supplemental Figure 6C).
AF64A is a cholinergic nerve-specific toxin, which induces vacu￾olar degeneration of cholinergic nerve endings (19). We injected 
AF64A into the rats and analyzed the sympathetic nerve endings 
with immunoelectron microscopy, using anti-TH antibody. In 
DR rats, the catecholaminergic nerve endings, which were labeled 
with the TH immunogold particles, remained intact, and vacuolar 
degeneration was observed only at the cholinergic nerve endings, 
which were marked with SAGVs. In DS rats, vacuolar degeneration 
was also observed at the catecholaminergic nerve endings, which 
were labeled with TH immunogold particles and had both SGVs 
and SAGVs (Figure 3D and Supplemental Figure 6D). Thus, the 
SNS acquired functional cholinergic activity in CHF.
Cardiomyocytes can induce neurotransmitter switching in cul￾tured sympathetic neurons by secretion of cholinergic differen￾tiation factors. We then investigated whether neurotransmitter 
switching of the SNS in DS rats may be mediated by humoral fac￾tors, specifically IL-6 family cytokines, neurotrophins, and glial cell–
derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), secreted from cardiomyocytes. 
Expression levels of Lif and cardiotrophin-1 (Ctf1) were significantly 
higher in the ventricles of DS rats than DR rats (approximately 
5-fold higher), as was the expression of Gdnf (2-fold higher), but 
there was no difference in the levels of expression of neurotrophin-3 
between animals with CHF and controls (Figure 4A).
We developed an in vitro model of heart failure by exposing cul￾tured cardiomyocytes to various stimuli, including Ang II, H2O2, 
doxorubicin, NE, ceramide, hypoxia, and mechanical stretch. The 
effect of induced heart failure on Lif and Ctf1 mRNA was quantified. 
All stimuli upregulated Lif and Ctf1, with the strongest effect observed 
for Ang II (Figure 4B). DS rat ventricles also showed upregulation 
of angiotensinogen (Agt) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (Ace), 
indicating renin-angiotensin system is augmented with CHF (Figure 
4A). Based on these findings, we treated the cultured cardiomyocytes 
with Ang II to mimic the failing myocardium. Ang II markedly aug￾mented Lif and Ctf1 by 8.1- and 4.2-fold, respectively, but had a less 
significant effect on the other factors (Figure 4C).
Primary stellate ganglion neurons were then cultured in the pres￾ence of conditioned media from unstimulated cardiomyocytes 
(UCM) or Ang II–stimulated cardiomyocytes (Ang II–CMs). Ang II–
CMs markedly upregulated Cht1 and VAChT (3.2- and 11.5-fold 
increases, respectively) and markedly downregulated Th, while UCM 
had no effect (Figure 4D). Direct treatment of stellate ganglion neu￾rons with Ang II did not induce any changes in cholinergic-related 
genes. Treatment of stellate ganglion neurons with LIF (10 ng/ml) 
had similar effects to those seen with conditioned media from stim￾ulated cardiomyocytes; upregulation of Cht1, Chat, and VAChT and 
marked downregulation of Th (Figure 4E). These results were con￾firmed by immunofluorescence staining (Figure 4F).
We then specifically inhibited Lif and/or Ctf1 expression by pre￾treatment of cardiomyocytes with siRNA before stimulation with 
Ang II. VAChT expression was reduced by 64% and 56% with siRNA 
specific for Lif and Ctf1, respectively, relative to their expression in 
cells treated with the negative control (scrambled) siRNA (Figure 
4G). Together, these results suggested that a combination of cholin￾ergic differentiation factors secreted from hypertrophic cardiomyo￾cytes, mainly LIF and CT-1, mediate neurotransmitter switching.
Cardiac-specific overexpression of LIF induces neurotransmit￾ter switching in the cardiac SNS. We first generated LIF-loxP mice 
and crossed them with α-myosin heavy chain–cardiac-specific Cre￾expressing (αMHC-Cre) mice (Figure 5A). The LIFαMHC-Cre double￾transgenic mice specifically overexpress LIF in the heart (Figure 
5B). We generated 13 double-transgenic lines, and selected lines 3 
and 10 as representative lines that expressed LIF at different lev￾els (Figure 5C and Supplemental Table 3). At 4 weeks of age, line 
3 and 10 mice showed moderate and severe cardiac hypertrophy, 
respectively, whereas the αMHC-Cre or LIF-loxP littermates did not 
show any obvious cardiac changes when compared to age-matched 
WT littermates. Body weight in line 10 was significantly decreased 
compared with the other mice.
WT, αMHC-Cre, and Lif-loxP mice had abundant TH+ nerves in LVs 
but very few CHT+ nerves. LIFαMHC-Cre line 10 mice had fewer TH+
nerves (78% of WT) and significantly more CHT+ nerves by 8 fold, 
but there were no changes in neurotransmitter phenotype in line 3 
(Figure 5, D and E). Cardiac NE concentration was also reduced in 
LIFαMHC-Cre hearts (line 10) (Figure 5F). Consistent with these results, 
the stellate ganglia in WT, αMHC-Cre, and Lif-loxP mice only had a 
few ChAT+ neurons, whereas LIFαMHC-Cre stellate ganglia (line 10) had 
abundant ChAT+ neurons, some of which coexpressed TH (Figure 
5, G and H). These show that cardiac-specific overexpression of LIF 
can induce neurotransmitter switching and cause cholinergic trans￾differentiation in the cardiac SNS in vivo.
SNS-specific conditional gp130 gene-targeted mice prevent heart fail￾ure–induced cholinergic transdifferentiation. We investigated whether 
gp130-mediated signaling induces cholinergic transdifferentia￾tion of SNS in CHF. SNS-specific EGFP reporter mice were gen￾erated by crossing DBH–Cre recombinase transgenic (DBH-Cre) 
mice with EGFP-floxed mice, and expression of the EGFP in the 
adrenal gland, stellate ganglia and SNS was confirmed (Figure 6A).

We demonstrated that 57% of the neuronal bodies of the stellate 
ganglia were marked with EGFP, thereby validating the efficiency 
of these transgenic mice (Figure 6B). SNS-specific gp130 gene-tar￾geted mice were generated by crossing DBH-Cre and gp130-floxed 
(gp130flox/flox) mice. The resultant gp130DBH-Cre mice developed nor￾mally, and, under normal physiological conditions, the stellate

consistent with control gp130flox/flox mice (Figure 6, C and E).

Chronic transverse aortic constriction and sustained hypoxia 
were used to generate a model of pressure overload-induced LV 
and RV heart failure, respectively (Supplemental Figure 7, A–F). 
Pressure gradient caused by transaortic constriction (TAC) was 
shown in Supplemental Figure 7, G and H. The baseline cardiac 
parameters of gp130DBH-Cre mice, including heart weight/body 
weight ratio, heart rate, blood pressure, RV systolic pressure 
(RVSP), maximum LVdP/dt, and maximum RVdP/dt, were not 
significantly different from those of gp130flox/flox mice (Supplemen￾tal Figure 8). gp130flox/flox mice showed cholinergic transdifferen￾tiation in cardiac SNS and stellate ganglia, consistent with the 
rat CHF model. These changes were rescued in gp130DBH-Cre mice 
(Figure 6, C and E). Quantitative analysis revealed that the relative 
TH+/NF+ nerve area of the ventricular SNS in gp130DBH-Cre mice 
returned to the control level, while the relative CHT+/NF+ nerve 
area was significantly reduced (Figure 6D). The ChAT+/TH+ ratio 
of the stellate ganglia was significantly reduced in gp130DBH-Cre
mice (Figure 6F). We demonstrated that 57% of the neuronal bod￾ies of the stellate ganglia were marked with EGFP, thereby validat￾ing the efficiency (Cre expression) of these transgenic mice. These

results suggest that cholinergic transdifferentiation of the SNS in 
CHF is regulated primarily by gp130-signaling pathway.
We also evaluated cardiac function in gp130flox/flox and gp130DBH-Cre
mice to determine whether cholinergic transdifferentiation has a 
significant effect in the setting of chronic hypoxia-induced heart 
failure. In chronic hypoxia, RVSP was significantly elevated in both 
gp130flox/flox and gp130DBH-Cre mice to levels that were not signifi￾cantly different from each other (Figure 7A). Furthermore, there 
was no significant difference in heart rate between gp130flox/flox
and gp130DBH-Cre mice (Figure 7B). The maximum RVdP/dt was 
significantly lower in both gp130DBH-Cre and gp130flox/flox mice than 
in controls, which is indicative of RV heart failure. Interestingly, 
the maximum RVdP/dt was significantly lower in gp130DBH-Cre mice 
than in gp130flox/flox mice (Figure 7, C and D). Moreover, Kaplan￾Meier analysis revealed a significant difference in the cumulative 
survival between gp130flox/flox and gp130DBH-Cre mice subjected to 
chronic hypoxia. These results suggested that cholinergic trans￾differentiation of the cardiac SNS via gp130 signaling might play a 
pivotal role in improving cardiac function during the development 
and progression of heart failure.
Neurotransmitter switching of the human cardiac SNS in CHF. To 
determine whether our observations held true in humans, we 
examined the neurotransmitter phenotype of the cardiac SNS in 
patients with CHF (Figure 8 and Table 1). Consistent with the 
experimental results, the epicardial nerve bundles of control 
hearts had a predominance of TH+ nerves, whereas CHT+ nerves 
were predominant in CHF hearts, with some nerves coexpress￾ing both markers. The same neurotransmitter phenotypes were 
seen in the stellate ganglia (Figure 9), confirming that the CHF 
patients undergo a switch from predominant catecholaminergic 
to cholinergic activity.
Discussion
The inherent plasticity of sympathetic neurons is widely accepted 
(8–10, 18, 20, 21). The neurotransmitter plasticity is also char￾acteristic of other neuron types, such as dorsal root ganglia 
sensory neurons (22). However, here we demonstrate that neu￾rotransmitter switching or cholinergic transdifferentiation of 
the cardiac SNS can also occur in a pathophysiological event, 
CHF, in the adult. These results suggest cardiac SNSs have dual 
potential and the capacity to switch neurotransmitter, according 
to environmental conditions. Furthermore, we have identified 
the mechanism for this process; failing cardiomyocytes secrete a 
host of factors that can drive the SNS toward cholinergic activity 
by gp130-mediated signaling pathway.
This cholinergic transdifferentiation in cardiac SNS can explain 
some long-standing questions about CHF. The failing heart 
requires sympathetic stimulation to increase cardiac performance 
but, paradoxically, shows depletion of NE (3). This was initially 
thought to be due to excess NE secretion (23, 24), but recent 
studies have suggested that it arises from decreased NE reuptake 
(25, 26) and decreased NE synthesis (6). TH+ nerves are reduced 
in hearts after CHF, leading to the assumption that the SNS is 
anatomically denervated (5, 27–29). Conversely, Liang reported 
that there was a discrepancy between anatomical integrity and 
the catecholaminergic properties of the cardiac SNS in CHF, 
and that nerve fibers expressing the general neuronal marker, 
protein gene product 9.5, are intact, despite an overall reduc￾tion in catecholaminergic neurotransmitters (30). We have previ￾ously shown that in the cardiac SNS in CHF, the expression of 
TH and DBH is downregulated, with concomitant upregulation 
of GAP43 or PSA-NCAM proteins (6). The cholinergic transdif￾ferentiation can explain these various observations. We propose 
that the neurotransmitter switching to the cholinergic phenotype 
might contribute to NE depletion and can explain the discrepancy 
between the anatomical profile and catecholaminergic properties 
of the cardiac SNS in CHF. It remains unknown why choliner￾gic transdifferentiation occurs. One possibility is that it is a side 
effect. Since LIF and CT-1 have a cardioprotective effect, their 
upregulation may be required for the survival of a failing heart, 
and this upregulation may accidentally cause transdifferentia￾tion. Another possibility is that cholinergic transdifferentiation 
of the SNS in CHF is an adaptive response to protect the heart 
from excessive sympathetic discharge, similar to the way that

β receptor downregulation, β adrenergic receptor kinase, and beta 
blockers are protective. Our findings showing the chronic hypoxia￾induced RV failure in gp130DBH-Cre mice suggest that cholinergic 
transdifferentiation of cardiac sympathetic nerves might be an 
adaptive response to protect the heart. Supporting this notion, 
cholinergic signaling via muscarinic Ach receptors has been 
shown to promote specific cytoprotective signaling pathways and 
to improve cardiac function (31, 32). Other studies have shown 
that augmentation of parasympathetic nerve activity decreased 
mortality rates with CHF, thus suggesting a beneficial effect of 
cholinergic signaling in CHF (33). Taken together, these findings 
support our idea that cholinergic transdifferentiation is an adap￾tive response. Further analysis is required to draw firm conclu￾sions on the importance of cholinergic transdifferentiation in 
modulating cardiac function.
LIF was first identified as a cholinergic differentiation factor 
from the conditioned medium of cardiomyocytes (11) and also 
has a range of specific roles in a variety of cell types (34, 35). Recent 
reports have shown that other members of the IL-6 cytokine fam￾ily (12), neurotophin-3 (36), and GDNF (37) can induce choliner￾gic differentiation. The present study found that a combination of 
cholinergic differentiation factors, particularly LIF and CT-1, are 
critical for this neurotransmitter change in cardiac SNS. LIF has 
previously been shown to be upregulated in cardiac hypertrophy 
and CHF (38, 39). Our study also determined the level of expres￾sion of LIF required for induction of neurotransmitter switching. 
Comparison of LIF-transgenic mice at different levels suggested 
there may be a threshold concentration required to induce trans￾differentiation. The expression level of LIF in DS rats was less 
than 8.9 fold (line 10), but we still observed the acquisition of cho￾linergic characteristics, suggesting that additional factors may be 
critically involved in this process. We observed 
that CHF-induced cholinergic transdifferentia￾tion is rescued by sympathetic neuron-specific 
gp130-targeted mice. This finding suggests that 
gp130-mediated cytokines, LIF and CT-1, play a 
pivotal role in cholinergic transdifferentiation 
of cardiac SNS.
This research began with the use of DS rats 
as a model for heart failure, because this model 
could produce heart failure with high reproduc￾ibility, without variation in the severity of heart 
failure, because this model can be obtained with￾out surgical treatment. In addition, we could 
not perform the experiment with the neuronal 
tracer using the mouse model. However, gain of 
function and loss of function was necessary to 
clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying 
heart failure. Thus, we used the genetic mouse 
model for our experiments.
The clinical significance of cholinergic trans￾differentiation in the cardiac SNS in CHF 
remains unclear, but further clarification of the 
mechanisms that mediate these phenomena may 
represent a novel step toward potential therapies 
in patients with CHF.
Methods
Animal experiments. Six-week-old DS and DR rats and 
six- to eight-week-old Wistar rats were purchased 
from Japan CLEA. Rats were fed a high-salt diet (8% NaCl) for 9 weeks. 
All experimental procedures and protocols were approved by the Animal 
Care and Use Committees of Keio University.
Generation of transgenic mice expressing LIF in the heart. LIF cDNA was sub￾cloned into pCALNL5 plasmid (a gift from I. Saito, University of Tokyo, 
Tokyo, Japan) (40), which contains chicken β-actin gene (CAG) promoter 
and loxP-neo-loxP. Transgenic mice (LIF-loxP mice) were generated by 
pronuclear microinjection. The transgene was identified by PCR analy￾sis (forward, 5′-GAGGATCGTTTCGCATGATT-3′; reverse, 5′-TATTCG￾GCAAGCAGGCATCG-3′). LIF-loxP mice were crossed with MHC-Cre 
mice (a gift from Michael D. Schneider, Imperial College London, London, 
United Kingdom) (41) to generate LifαMHC-Cre mice.
Generation of sympathetic nerve–specific gp130 gene-targeted mice. The gp130flox/flox
mice (42) and DBH-Cre mice (43) were provided by Werner Müller (GBF mbH, 
Braunschweig, Germany) and Günther Schütz (German Cancer Research 
Center, Heidelberg, Germany), respectively. The CAG–chloramphenicol acetyl 
transferase–EGFP (CAG-CAT-EGFP) transgenic mice, carrying the reporter 
gene construct CAG-CAT-EGFP (44), were a gift from J. Miyazaki (Osaka 
University, Osaka, Japan). Double-transgenic mice were generated by cross￾ing DBH-Cre mice with either the gp130flox/flox or CAG-CAT-EGFP mice.
Preparation of cardiomyocyte-conditioned media. Primary culture of neonatal 
Wistar rat cardiomyocytes was performed as described previously (45). Car￾diomyocytes were incubated in medium containing serum for 24 hours and 
then the medium was replaced with fresh serum-free medium. After 24 hours 
with or without Ang II (1 × 107 M), the conditioned media was collected.
Heart failure was simulated in vitro by exposing cardiomyocytes to 
1 × 10–7 M Ang II (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 minutes, 50 μmol/l H2O2 for 
3 hours (Wako), 1 μmol/l doxorubicin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 hours, 10 μmol/l 
NE (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 minutes, or 5 μmol/l ceramide for 15 minutes 
(Sigma-Aldrich). For hypoxic stimulation, the cells were cultured in a 90% 
N2/5% CO2/5% O2 atmosphere for 2 hours. For mechanical stretch stimu￾Table 1

lation, cardiomyocytes were cultured on laminin-coated silicon dishes 
that were stretched by 20% for 1 hour.
Lif and Ctf1 siRNA transfection. Lif and Ctf1 siRNA and negative control 
(scrambled) siRNA were purchased from Ambion. Cardiomyocytes were 
transfected using the Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen).
Culture of sympathetic neurons. Stellate ganglia neurons from 2-day￾old Wistar rats (Japan CLEA) were dissociated and cultured in DMEM 
(Sigma-Aldrich) containing 5% fetal bovine serum and nerve growth factor 
(50 ng/ml; Upstate), as described previously (8, 9). Proliferation of non￾neuronal cells was prevented by addition of 10 μM cytosine 1β-d-arabino 
furanoside (Sigma-Aldrich) for the first 5 days. After 2 days, the neurons 
were cultured with LIF (Chemicon) or cardiomyocyte-conditioned media 
for 14 days. The culture media was replaced every 2–3 days.
RNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR. RNA extraction and quantitative 
RT-PCR were performed as described previously (45) using the ABI Prism 
7500 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). All samples were

m1), and ACE (Rn00561094_m1) were purchased from Applied Biosys￾tems. The mRNA levels were normalized by comparison to GAPDH.
RT-PCR. The primers for ChAT (46) and VAChT (47) were as described 
previously. The primers for murine LIF were murine LIF forward, 
5′-CCTCTAGAGTCCAGCCCATAA-3′, and murine LIF reverse, 5′-CTC￾TAGAAGGCCTGGACCAC-3′.
Western blot analysis. Samples were prepared by homogenization of hearts 
in ice-cold buffer as described (45). Immunodetection was performed with 
an anti-LIF antibody (AB-449-NA; R&D Systems). After transfer to nitro￾cellulose membranes, LIF protein was visualized by chemiluminescence 
detection (SuperSignal West Pico; Pierce).
Immunohistochemistry. Hearts were perfused from the apex with 0.4% 
paraformaldehyde in PBS, fixed overnight, embedded in OCT compound, 
and then frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cryostat sections were stained with anti￾bodies against TH (Chemicon, Sigma-Aldrich, and ImmunoStar) and DBH 
to detect sympathetic nerves, with CHT (Chemicon) and ChAT (Chemicon) 
to detect parasympathetic nerves, and with calcitonin gene-related peptide 
(Biogenesis) to detect sensory nerves. The sections were incubated with 
secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 546, 
Alexa Fluor 633 (Molecular Probes) and TRITC (DAKO), and the nuclei 
were stained with Toto3 (Molecular Probes). All confocal microscopy was 
carried out on a LSM 510 META Confocal Microscope (Carl Zeiss). In some 
experiments, paraffin-embedded sections were treated with 10 mM citrate 
buffer (pH 6) and 20 mM Tris-HCL buffer (pH 9) for antigen retrieval, and 
signals were visualized using a TSA Direct Kit (NEN Life Science). Nerve 
density was determined using ImageJ software (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/) 
(48). For human sympathetic ganglia, cresyl violet staining (Nissl staining) 
was performed, and the total number of neurons was determined.
Anterograde labeling of sympathetic nerve fibers. To label sympathetic nerve 
fibers in the stellate ganglia, DS and DR rats were injected with 10% BDA 
in the left stellate ganglia, via a Hamilton micropipette under mechanical 
ventilation. The rats were killed after 3 days and were perfused with 0.4% 
paraformaldehyde in PBS for immunohistochemistry.
Transmission electron microscopy. Hearts were fixed with 0.2% glutaralde￾hyde and 0.4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer and embedded 
in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections (80 nm) were stained as described previ￾ously (49) and viewed under a JEOL-1230 transmission electron micro￾scope (JEOL Ltd.). AF64A was prepared from acetylethylcholine mustard 
hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) and administered to rats intraperitoneally 
(150 μmol/kg). AF64A is specifically taken up by CHT and degener￾ates cholinergic nerve fibers. Saline was injected in control experiments. 
After 3 days, hearts were removed and fixed as above. The samples were 
immunostained with an antibody against TH (Chemicon) and incubated 
with a secondary antibody of Nanogold-Fab conjugates (Nanoprobes). The 
conjugated gold particles were visualized as described previously (50).
Mouse models of heart failure. LV failure was induced by TAC, which was 
performed by ligating the transverse thoracic aorta with a 27-gauge nee￾dle, using a 7.0 nylon suture (51). RV failure was induced by long-stand￾ing hypoxia (10% O2) in the mouse model of pulmonary hypertension as 
described previously (52).
Echocardiography and hemodynamic measurements. Transthoracic echocar￾diography was performed with a Vevo 770 scanner (VisualSonics), using 
17.5 and 30 MHz probes. TAC pressure gradients were determined by 
pulsed-wave Doppler echocardiography and calculated as 4 × Vmax2, where 
Vmax is the velocity of the blood across the constriction. Mice with a pres￾sure gradient of more than 40 mmHg were included in the study. For 
hemodynamic measurements, the mice were intubated and then mechani￾cally ventilated with a respirator. A left thoracotomy was performed, and 
RV pressure was measured from a 1.0F Mikro-Tip pressure transducer 
(SPR-1000; Millar Instruments), directly inserted into the RV. The LV and 
aortic pressures were measured by catheters inserted into the right carotid 
artery. LV pressure, RV pressure, and aortic pressure were recorded using a 
polygraph system (iWorx Systems Inc.). All recordings were performed on 
rats and mice anesthetized with 2% isoflurane.
Human samples. Control samples of LV and stellate ganglia were pre￾pared from 8 autopsied patients without heart disease (mean age, 57 ± 17 
years). Heart failure samples were prepared from 8 autopsied patients 
(mean age, 51 ± 13 years), who died of CHF due to various heart diseases, as 
described in Table 1. After removal samples were fixed immediately in 0.4% 
paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin or OCT compound. The use 
of autopsied specimens of human tissue was approved by the institutional 
review board of Keio University and National Cardiovascular Center.
Statistics. Values are presented as mean ± SD. Statistical significance was 
evaluated using 2-tailed, unpaired Student’s t tests for comparisons of 
2 mean values. P values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically sig￾nificant. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were analyzed by SPSS software. 
Survival analysis was performed by using the Kaplan-Meier method. The 
log-rank test was used to compare survival curves.
