Abstract
Objective To clarify the clinical characteristics of type 2 diabetic patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver dis￾ease (NAFLD) and to assess whether NAFLD is related to angiopathy.
Methods The study included 388 Japanese type 2 diabetic outpatients without viral hepatitis. The main out￾come measures were angiopathy and NAFLD.
Results The 388 subjects were divided into two subgroups based on alcohol consumption. Fatty liver was
recognized in 36 of the 142 drinking patients (25%). There was no association of fatty liver disease with dia￾betic macro- or microangiopathy in these patients. Fatty liver disease (namely, NAFLD) was recognized in 77
of the 246 non-drinking patients (31%). Type 2 diabetic patients with NAFLD had a significantly younger
age, higher body mass index level, higher levels of HbA1c, total cholesterol and triglyceride, lower HDL-C
level, higher prevalence rates of hypercholesterolemia and obesity than counterparts without NAFLD. In addi￾tion, individuals in the elderly (≧65 years) non-drinking group with NAFLD had a significantly higher
prevalence rates of diabetic macroangiopathy, coronary heart disease and thicker intima-media thickness level
than their counterparts without NAFLD. The logistic regression analysis showed that NAFLD is an independ￾ent predictor of diabetic macroangiopathy.
Conclusion NAFLD was associated with an increased prevalence of diabetic macroangiopathy and coronary
heart disease in elderly patients. In addition, NAFLD is an independent predictor for diabetic macroangiopa￾thy. These findings suggest that type 2 diabetic patients with NAFLD should be considered as a high risk
group for developing macroangiopathy, even if macroangiopathy is not clinically detected.

Introduction
Fatty liver is very common, especially in overweight indi￾viduals. The prevalence of fatty liver disease (FLD) in the
general population ranges from 10% to 24% in various
countries (1). FLD is a reversible condition where large
vacuoles of triglyceride fat accumulate in liver cells, and
sometimes cause serious liver problems. The liver has an
important role in the regulation of metabolism. Several
pathological conditions are associated with intra-hepatic tri￾glyceride accumulation, but FLD has long been considered
as a trivial finding. Although FLD has multiple causes, it is
thought to be associated with excessive alcohol intake and
obesity. However, recent studies have revealed many new
metabolic aspects of FLD, especially non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease (NAFLD).
NAFLD is a clinicopathological syndrome closely corre￾lated to visceral obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and
type 2 diabetes, suggesting that NAFLD is feature of meta￾１Department of Diabetes, Metabolism and Kidney Disease, Edogawa Hospital, Japan and ２Department of Laboratory, Edogawa Hospital, Japan

bolic syndrome (2-5). NAFLD encompasses a broad spec￾trum of liver diseases ranging from simple steatosis (fatty
liver) to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrho￾sis (6-8). This metabolically derived liver disease is becom￾ing a major problem in hepatology departments, and it is
now recognized as the most common chronic liver condition
in the Western world (6). Jimba et al. showed that the preva￾lence of NAFLD was 29% in apparently healthy middle￾aged Japanese adults (9). The majority of patients with
NAFLD are overweight/obese or has type 2 diabetes; an￾other commonly associated clinical feature is atherogenic
dyslipidemia (i.e. high triglyceride, low HDL-cholesterol
and increased small dense LDL-cholesterol levels). A great
deal of evidence suggests that NAFLD is the hepatic mani￾festation of metabolic syndrome (10). Notably, NAFLD is
associated with insulin resistance even in non-obese and
non-diabetic individuals, suggesting that NAFLD may be an
early predictor of metabolic disorders and diseases in the
normal-weight population (11). Accordingly, the cardiovas￾cular disease risk dictates the outcome of these patients
more frequently and to a greater extent than does liver dis￾ease progression. Although NAFLD is recognized in type 2
diabetic patients with a relatively high frequency, the clinical
characteristics of these patients are not sufficiently clarified.
The present study sought to clarify the clinical characteris￾tics of type 2 diabetic patients with NAFLD and to examine
the association of NAFLD with diabetic angiopathy in these
patients.
Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
This study was conducted according to the principles ex￾pressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. The Ethics Commit￾tees of Edogawa Hospital approved the protocol of this
study and waived the need for written informed consent be￾cause the data were analyzed anonymously for this observa￾tion study based on the data stored in the hospital database.
Study patients
A total of 388 Japanese type 2 diabetic outpatients were
selected from all outpatients that presented from 2007 to
2008 (n=1,307) for the study. A total of 919 patients were
excluded because a physical measurement was missed, ab￾dominal ultrasonography was not performed or their alcohol
drinking habit was unclear. All participants were asked
about their medical history and alcohol consumption, and
underwent a physical examination. Alcohol consumption
was determined with a question that was embedded in the
health interview self-report questionnaire. The patients were
asked to indicate whether they drank alcohol or abstained
(yes/no) and if they indicated that they did drink, to describe
how many drinks they daily consumed in a given volume of
alcohol in ethanol equivalents (20 g/>20 g daily). The pre￾sent study defined the patients drinking >20 g ethanol
equivalents/day as ’drinking patients’. Patients drinking alco￾hol 20 g/day or abstainers were defined as ’non-drinking
patients’. NAFLD was defined as a fatty liver detected by
abdominal ultrasonography in individuals whose consump￾tion of alcohol was 20 g daily or abstainers (12). Blood
sampling, routine medical examinations of their glycemic
control and chronic diabetes complications, abdominal ultra￾sonography, echo-Doppler scanning of carotid arteries,
measurement of ankle brachial pressure index (ABI) and
brachial-ankle pulse wave velocities (baPWV) were also
performed for all participants.
Clinical measurements and laboratory procedures
Body mass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing the
weight in kilograms by the height in meters squared. The
blood pressure was measured twice with the subjects in a
sitting position after a 5-minute rest. The lower value of the
two measurements was used for the study. Hypertension was
defined as a systolic blood pressure 140 mmHg and/or a
diastolic blood pressure 90 mmHg. The participants cur￾rently using antihypertensive medications were also classi￾fied as positive for hypertension. Information on daily alco￾hol consumption and current use of medications was ob￾tained from all participants by a questionnaire. Sixty-three
percent of the participants (n=246) were abstainers or drank
minimally (alcohol consumption 20 g/day). Thirty-seven
percent (n=142) of participants were moderate or heavy
drinkers (alcohol consumption >20 g/day).
Venous blood measurements were performed by standard
laboratory procedures. Most participants had serum liver en￾zymes within the reference ranges in our laboratory, which
for aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotrans￾ferase (ALT) and γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) activities
were 10 to 35 U/L for women and 10-50 U/L for men. Tri￾glycerides were measured at any time, either after fasting or
after a meal. No participants had seropositivity for viral
hepatitis B and C. The HbA1c levels were determined by
high performance liquid chromatography using an automated
HLC-723G7 analyzer (Tosoh Corporation, Tokyo, Japan)
and calibrated by the Japan Diabetes Society (JDS) standard
calibrators. The value for HbA1c (%) is estimated as a Na￾tional Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP)
equivalent value (%) calculated by the formula: HbA1c =
HbA1c (JDS) + 0.4, considering the relational expression of
HbA1c (JDS) measured by the previous Japanese standard
substance and measurement methods and HbA 1 c
(NGSP) (13). The estimated glomerular filtration rate
(eGFR) was calculated using the formula reported by Ma￾tsuo et al. (14). This equation originated from the MDRD
study group (15) adjusted for Japanese individuals, and rec￾ommended by the Japanese Society of Nephrology: eGFR
(mL/min/1.73m2
)=194×Scr-1.094×Age-0.287×0.739 (if female).
Hypercholesterolemia was defined by serum concentrations
of total cholesterol 220 mg/dL, LDL-cholesterol 140 mg/
dL or as patients already being treated with lipid-lowering
agents.

The ankle brachial pressure index (ABI) and brachial￾ankle pulse wave velocities (baPWV) were measured as in￾dicators of atherosclerosis using Form PWV/ABI, BP-203
PRE II (Omron Colin Co., Ltd., Bunkyo, Tokyo, Japan).
The intima-media thickness (IMT) of the carotid artery was
measured with ultrasonographic examinations by skilled
laboratory technicians using Aplio XV ultrasound machine
(Toshiba Medical Systems Corp., Ohtawara, Tochigi, Japan).
B-mode imaging of the carotid artery and examination of
IMT was performed as described in our previous re￾port (16). Although the carotid IMT increases with age, it
does not rise above 1.0 mm in normal Japanese adults.
Therefore, the presence of increased IMT (IMT thickening)
in the carotid artery has been defined as an IMT of 1.1
mm (17).
Assessment and definition of diabetic microangiopathy
was based on the following criteria. Diabetic nephropathy
(DN) was staged according to an analysis of a spot urine
sample as: DN stage I (normoalbuminuria), albumin/cre￾atinine ratio (ACR) <30 mg/g creatinine; DN stage II (mi￾croalbuminuria), 30 ACR <300 mg/g creatinine; DN stage
III (macroalbuminuria), ACR 300 mg/g creatinine (or dip￾stick urinalysis revealed 2+, 3+ or 4+) and eGFR 30 mL/
min/1.73m2
; and DN stage IV, ACR 300 mg/g creatinine
(or dipstick urinalysis 2+, 3+ or 4+) and eGFR <30 mL/
min/1.73m2
. Diabetic retinopathy was defined as simple ret￾inopathy or as more severe conditions, which were judged
according to the results of a fundoscopic examination per￾formed by expert ophthalmologists. Diabetic neuropathy was
diagnosed by the presence of two or more components
among clinical symptoms (bilateral spontaneous pain, hy￾poesthesia, or paresthesia of the legs), the absence of ankle
tendon reflexes and decreased vibration sensations using a C
128 tuning fork.
Assessment and definition of diabetic macroangiopathy
was based on the following criteria. Coronary heart disease
(CHD) was diagnosed based on a previous history of myo￾cardial infarction, angina pectoris, electrocardiogram abnor￾malities suggesting myocardial ischemia or intervention after
coronary angiographic examination. Cerebrovascular disease
(CVD) was diagnosed by the physicians as a history of an
ischemic stroke using brain computed tomography or mag￾netic resonance imaging. Only the patients with symptoms
were classified as having cerebrovascular disease, and cases
of silent brain infarction, transient ischemic attack or brain
hemorrhage were excluded from this study. Peripheral arte￾rial disease (PAD) was diagnosed by the absence of a pulse
in the legs along with ischemic symptoms, obstructive find￾ings on an ultrasonographic examination of the lower ex￾tremities, or ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI) <0.9. The
present study defined ‘diabetic macroangiopathy’ as a ge￾neric concept of large blood vessel disorders including either
CHD, CVD or PAD in diabetic patients.
Statistical analysis
Data are shown as the means ± SD. Clinical characteris￾tics were compared by two-tailed unpaired t-tests or a one￾way analysis of variance for continuous variables, and the
chi-squared test for categorical variables. Differences with p
values of less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically
significant. The JMP statistical software package, version
8.0, (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) was used to perform
all analyses.
Results
Three hundred eighty-eight patients were analyzed. They
were divided into two groups based on their alcohol con￾sumption, the drinking group (n=142) and the non-drinking
group (n=246). Table 1 shows the clinical characteristics of
the patients in each group. The percentage of alcohol drink￾ing was significantly less in the female participants (12 vs.
46%, p<0.01). Drinking patients had a younger age at onset
of diabetes (51±10 vs. 54±10 years, p<0.05), higher GGT
level (70±88 vs. 44±101 U/mL, p<0.05) and a higher HDL￾C level (64±19 vs. 57±15 mg/dL, p<0.01) than non-drinking
patients. Thirty-six of the 142 drinking patients developed
fatty liver disease. Seventy-seven of the 246 non-drinking
patients developed FLD. The prevalence of FLD was 25%
and 31%, respectively, and there was no significant differ￾ence between these subgroups.
Table 2 shows the clinical and biochemical characteristics
of the four subgroups; drinking patients with FLD, drinking
patients without FLD, non-drinking patients with FLD and
non-drinking patients without FLD. Drinking type 2 diabetic
patients with FLD had significantly higher BMI level (26.2±
4.0 vs. 23.1±4.0 kg/m2
, p<0.01) and higher rates of obesity
(56 vs. 23%, p<0.01) than their counterparts without FLD.
There was no significant difference between these two sub￾groups in other variables including the lipid profile. No as￾sociation of FLD was recognized with macro- or microan￾giopathy in drinking type 2 diabetic patients.
Table 2 also shows the clinical and biochemical character￾istics of non-drinking patients after dividing the subjects
into two subgroups according to FLD. Non-drinking type 2
diabetic patients with FLD (namely, NAFLD) had a younger
age (61±9 vs. 65±7 years, p<0.01), higher BMI level (26.4±
3.6 vs. 23.7±3.7 kg/m2
, p<0.01), higher HbA1c level (8.2±
1.9 vs. 7.7±2.0%, p=0.04), higher TC level (211±56 vs.
197±44 mg/dL, p=0.04), lower HDL-C level (53±19 vs. 58±
18 mg/dL, p=0.01), higher TG level (215±197 vs. 146±83
mg/dL, p<0.01), higher eGFR level (58±18 vs. 53±19 mL/
min/1.73m2
, P=0.04), higher rates of obesity (61 vs. 30%,
p<0.01) and hypercholesterolemia (79 vs. 63%, p=0.01) than
their counterparts without NAFLD.
The non-drinking type 2 diabetic patients were divided
into four subgroups to adjust for the influence of the pa￾tients’ age; elderly patients (age 65 years) with NAFLD,
elderly patients without NAFLD, nonelderly patients (age 
64 years) with NAFLD and nonelderly patients without
NAFLD. Fig. 1 shows the prevalence rates of diabetic
macroangiopathy in each subgroup. As shown in Fig. 1a,

patients with NAFLD had significantly higher prevalence
rates of macroangiopathy and CHD than counterparts with￾out NAFLD (Fig. 1b). Fig. 2 shows the measurements of
IMT, baPWV and ABI in these four subgroups. The IMT
was significantly thicker in elderly patients with NAFLD
than in their counterparts without NAFLD. The numerical
value of baPWV, another predictor of atherosclerosis, had a
tendency to be higher in elderly patients with NAFLD than
in counterparts without NAFLD (p>0.05).
The non-drinking type 2 diabetic patients were divided
into four subgroups to investigate the influence of obesity
on macroangiopathy; non-obese patients (BMI <25 kg/m2
)
with NAFLD, non-obese patients without NAFLD, obese
patients (BMI 25 kg/m2
) with NAFLD and obese patients
without NAFLD. Fig. 3 shows the prevalence of diabetic
macroangiopathy in each subgroup. There was no significant
difference in the rates of macroangiopathy, CHD, CVD and
PAD between the non-obese, non-drinking type 2 diabetes
patients with NAFLD and those without NAFLD. Obese
non-drinking type 2 diabetic patients with NAFLD had sig￾nificantly higher rates of macroangiopathy, CHD and PAD
than their counterparts without NAFLD (Fig. 3b). Although
IMT, baPWV and ABI were also measured in these four
subgroups, there were no significant differences.
Furthermore, the non-drinking type 2 diabetic patients
were divided into four subgroups to investigate the influence
of sex on macroangiopathy; male patients with NAFLD,
male patients without NAFLD, female patients with NAFLD
and female patients without NAFLD. Fig. 4 shows the rates
of diabetic macroangiopathy in each subgroup. There was
no significant difference in the rates of macroangiopathy,
CHD, CVD and PAD between the male, non-drinking type
2 diabetes patients with NAFLD and those without NAFLD.
Female non-drinking type 2 diabetic patients with NAFLD
had significantly higher rates of macroangiopathy, CHD than
their counterparts without NAFLD (Fig. 4b). Although the
IMT, baPWV and ABI were also measured in these four
subgroups, there were no significant differences.
Table 3 shows the association of clinical variables with
macroangiopathy determined by a logistic analysis in non￾drinking type 2 diabetic patients. Fatty liver was signifi￾cantly and independently associated with diabetic macroan￾giopathy (p=0.02).
Discussion
This study clarified the clinical and biochemical charac￾teristics of type 2 diabetic patients with FLD including
NAFLD. First, we found no association between FLD and
the prevalence ratios of macro- and microangiopathy in
drinking type 2 diabetic patients. We showed that drinking
type 2 diabetic patients with FLD had a significantly higher
BMI level, higher rates of obesity and hypercholesterolemia
than those without FLD. As shown in Table 2, these differ￾ences were also recognized in non-drinking type 2 diabetic
patients, but the lipid profiles were different between the

drinking group and non-drinking group. Non-drinking pa￾tients with FLD had a significantly higher TC level, lower
HDL-C level and higher TG level than their counterparts
without FLD. On the other hand, the TC level, HDL-C level
and TG level showed no difference between drinking type 2
diabetic patients with FLD and those without FLD. Alcohol
drinking may therefore have an anti-atherogenic effect on
blood vessels by altering the lipid profile. Further investiga￾tion is necessary to ascertain the influence of alcohol drink￾ing on angiopathy.
The non-drinking patients were examined in detail by di￾viding these patients into two subgroups, patients with fatty
liver (NAFLD) and patients without fatty liver. Type 2 dia￾betic patients with NAFLD had a significantly younger age,
higher levels of BMI, HbA1c, TC and TG, lower HDL-C
level and higher prevalence rates of obesity and hypercho￾lesterolemia than their counterparts without NAFLD. Previ￾ous studies noted that NAFLD is associated with insulin re￾sistance and metabolic syndrome (obesity, combined hyper￾lipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus and high blood pres￾sure) (18, 19). These clinical characteristics were also recog￾nized in type 2 diabetic patients with NAFLD in the current
series, though they had a relatively long duration of diabetes
(~10 years). Jimba et al. reported that NAFLD is associated
with impaired glucose metabolism in Japanese adults (9).
They also showed that NAFLD is independently associated
with an increasing fasting plasma glucose level even in non￾diabetic individuals. In fact, type 2 diabetic patients with
NAFLD possessed several factors of metabolic syndrome in
the current study. Consequently, it is possible that type 2
diabetic patients with NAFLD had gradually developed dia￾betes on the basis of impaired glucose metabolism, espe￾cially insulin resistance.
Several studies have shown that there is an association of
NAFLD with CHD (20, 21). The current findings were

somewhat consistent with the previous data, but clearly
showed that the prevalence of CHD was significantly in￾creased in elderly (age 65 years) type 2 diabetic patients
with NAFLD than in those without NAFLD (Fig. 1b). In
addition, elderly type 2 diabetic patients with NAFLD had a
significantly thicker carotid IMT level than the counterparts
without NAFLD (Fig. 2b). Targher demonstrated that the in￾crease of carotid artery wall thickness is associated with the
histological severity of NAFLD (22). These findings suggest
that the degree of hepatic damage by NAFLD could be
more severe in elderly patients than in nonelderly patients.
We also demonstrated that the prevalence of macroangiopa￾thy and CHD was significantly increased in obese type 2
diabetic patients with NAFLD (Fig. 3b). These results were
very similar to the results shown in Fig. 1b, suggesting that
NAFLD is frequently associated with obesity. Furthermore,
the prevalence of macroangiopathy and CHD significantly
increased in female type 2 diabetic patients with NAFLD
(Fig. 4b). The cause and effect of these differences was un￾clear, and further investigation is therefore necessary to as￾certain the influence of sex on diabetic macroangiopathy.
Although both obesity and sex were considered to be impor￾tant factors for developing macroangiopathy, a multivariate
regression analysis showed that the presence of NAFLD was
independently associated with increasing macroangiopathy
in non-drinking type 2 diabetic patients (Table 3).
What is the common factor associated with NAFLD, athe￾rosclerosis and impaired glucose metabolism? Insulin resis￾tance could be a potential answer to that question. Insulin
resistance is associated with the development of atheroscle￾rosis and macroangiopathy (23, 24). In addition, insulin re￾sistance is closely associated with FLD including
NAFLD (6). The development of type 2 diabetes mellitus is
characterized by not only insulin resistance but also im￾paired beta-cell function. Although insulin resistance is an
important pathogenic factor of type 2 diabetes mellitus, it is
important to pay attention to insufficient insulin secretion
especially in Japanese patients. Japanese often develop type
2 diabetes mellitus based on insufficient insulin secretion,
not insulin resistance (25, 26). Therefore, Japanese type 2
diabetic patients with NAFLD may have a distinct feature
characterized by insulin resistance. The clinical index for in￾sulin resistance, such as HOMA-IR was not examined in the
current study, because the subjects of this study were outpa￾tients (they did not always present in a fasting state). Closer
observation is expected to reveal the influence of insulin re￾sistance in these patients. The current findings suggest that
type 2 diabetic patients with NAFLD should be considered
as a high risk group for developing macroangiopathy, even
if macroangiopathy is not detected clinically. Further investi￾gation is necessary to ascertain whether there is a time￾dependent effect of NAFLD in these patients.
In conclusion, NAFLD is significantly associated with
diabetic macroangiopathy. Type 2 diabetic patients with
NAFLD (especially, if they are elderly) require intensive ex￾amination to assess macroangiopathy, even if it is not de￾tected clinically.
The present study had several important limitations. First,
it was a small, cross-sectional study that was unable to show
a causal relation between the higher incidence of macroan￾giopathy and NAFLD. Validation of the current results and
further elucidation of the potential mechanisms involved are,
therefore, essential. Second, the presence of fatty liver was
determined only once in clinical practice. Although patients
with viral hepatitis were excluded from the study, it would
have been better to check the severity of FLD in periodic
medical examinations.
Conclusion
This study clarified the clinical characteristics of type 2
diabetic patients with NAFLD. NAFLD was significantly as￾sociated with an increased prevalence of macroangiopathy,
especially coronary heart disease in elderly patients. This
study also found that NAFLD was independently associated
with macroangiopathy in non-drinking type 2 diabetic pa￾tients. These findings suggest that type 2 diabetic patients
with NAFLD should be considered as a high risk group for
developing macroangiopathy, even if macroangiopathy is not
detected clinically.
