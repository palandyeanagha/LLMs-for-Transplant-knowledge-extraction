Abstract
The surveillance of congenital anomalies serves two main purposes:
to facilitate the identification of teratogenic (malformation causing)
exposures and to assess the impact of primary prevention and
prenatal screening policy and practice at a population level.
EUROCAT, the European network of population based registers for
the epidemiological surveillance of congenital anomalies, now
covers 1.2 million births per year, a quarter of births in Europe. The


added value of European collaboration is particularly great for
congenital anomalies, coming from the opportunity to pool data, to
compare data between regions and countries, to give a common
response to European public health questions, and to share
expertise and resources, including computing tools. EUROCAT
provides essential epidemiological information on congenital
anomalies in Europe, facilitates the early warning of teratogenic
exposures, evaluates the effectiveness of primary prevention,
assesses the impact of developments in prenatal screening, acts as
an information and resource centre regarding clusters, provides a
ready collaborative network and infrastructure for research, and
acts as a catalyst for the setting up of registries throughout Europe.
