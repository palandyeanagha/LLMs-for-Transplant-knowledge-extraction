infection

Abstract
Background: Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), a single stranded RNA virus, affects millions of people worldwide and leads to
chronic infection characterized by chronic inflammation in the liver and in peripheral immune cells. Chronic liver
inflammation leads to progressive liver damage. MicroRNAs (miRNA) regulate inflammation (miR-155, -146a and
-125b) as well as hepatocyte function (miR-122).
Methods: Here we hypothesized that microRNAs are dysregulated in chronic HCV infection. We examined miRNAs
in the circulation and in peripheral monocytes of patients with chronic HCV infection to evaluate if specific miRNA
expression correlated with HCV infection.
Results: We found that monocytes from chronic HCV infected treatment-naïve (cHCV) but not treatment
responder patients showed increased expression of miR-155, a positive regulator of TNFα, and had
increased TNFα production compared to monocytes of normal controls. After LPS stimulation, miR-155
levels were higher in monocytes from cHCV patients compared to controls. MiR-125b, which has negative
regulatory effects on inflammation, was decreased in cHCV monocytes compared to controls. Stimulation of
normal monocytes with TLR4 and TLR8 ligands or HCV core, NS3 and NS5 recombinant proteins induced
a robust increase in both miR-155 expression and TNFα production identifying potential mechanisms for
in vivo induction of miR-155. Furthermore, we found increased serum miR-155 levels in HCV patients
compared to controls. Serum miR-125b and miR-146a levels were also increased in HCV patients. Serum
levels of miR-122 were elevated in cHCV patients and correlated with increased ALT and AST levels and
serum miR-155 levels.
Conclusion: In conclusion, our novel data demonstrate that miR-155, a positive regulator of inflammation,
is upregulated both in monocytes and in the serum of patients with chronic HCV infection. Our study
suggests that HCV core, NS3, and NS5 proteins or TLR4 and TLR8 ligands can mediate increased miR-155
and TNFα production in chronic HCV infection. The positive correlation between serum miR-155 and
miR-122 increase in cHCV may be an indicator of inflammation-induced hepatocyte damage.

Background
Hepatitis C virus infection affects over 170 million
people worldwide, and the majority of those have chronic
hepatitis that can lead to progressive liver disease, cirrho￾sis and hepatocellular cancer. Elimination of the HCV
virus by the immune system is a complex process and
alterations in both innate and adaptive immune
responses contribute to chronic HCV infection [1].
Chronic HCV infection is characterized by the presence
and activation of inflammatory cells in the liver, and the
persistent inflammation contributes to liver fibrosis and
liver damage [2,3]. In addition to the local inflammation
in the liver, a low-grade systemic inflammation was
noted in several studies, specifically, increased pro￾inflammatory cytokine levels and activation of blood
monocytes was found in individuals with chronic HCV
infection [4,5]. Our previous studies suggested that
monocytes from cHCV patients produce increased levels
of TNFα, and this was related to a loss of toll-like recep￾tor tolerance that is a mechanism in healthy cells to pre￾vent pro-inflammatory over-activation [6]. Other studies
also showed a correlation between HCV virus levels, in￾flammation and liver injury in chronic HCV infection
[7,8].
Innate immune responses provide the first line of
defense to pathogens. Innate immune responses can be
mediated by pathogen-derived signals such as lipopoly￾saccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria that bind
to toll like receptor 4 (TLR4), or HCV core (viral core
protein) and NS3 (non-structural viral protein) proteins
from Hepatitis C virus (HCV) that can activate cells via
TLR2 [9,10]. A recent study demonstrated that NS5
(non-structural viral protein) also induces TNFα in
human Kupffer cells [11]. Moreover, viral envelope pro￾tein E2 has been shown to interact with CD81 and
enhances the expression of activation-induced cytidine
deaminase and TNFα production in B cells [12]. The en￾gagement of TLRs leads to the activation and expression
of many genes that are directed to clear the pathogen.
HCV, a single-stranded RNA virus, also interacts with
TLR7/8, which recognizes small pieces of non-self
nucleotides [13]. With the activation of many of the
TLRs, the transcription factor NFκB is activated and sub￾sequent inflammatory genes are transcribed. With the
growing evidence for the roles of microRNAs (miRNAs)
as posttranscriptional regulators of inflammation, we
hypothesized that miRNAs involved in inflammation in
monocytes may be dysregulated in HCV patients, thereby
contributing to inflammatory cell activation.
The miRNAs relevant to monocyte inflammatory activa￾tion are miR-155, miR-146a, and miR-125b as they regu￾late inflammation at multiple levels [14]. MicroRNA-155
is a positive regulator of TNFα, which is a key cytokine of
inflammation and regulated at the transcriptional level by
the transcription factor, NF-κB. Previous studies have
found elevated TNFα levels in HCV patients, thus we
aimed to investigate the role of miRNAs that are known
to regulate TNFα. Other miRNAs that are involved in the
regulation of TNFα directly or indirectly include miR￾125b and miR-146a, which are the negative regulators of
TLR4/LPS signaling [14,15].
In this study, we report increased expression of miR￾155 in monocytes of patients with chronic HCV infection
that is no longer present in individuals who underwent
successful antiviral therapy. Our results demonstrate that
miR-155 is also increased in the serum of cHCV patients
along with miR-122, a microRNA abundant in hepato￾cytes. Our studies also identify possible mechanisms for
in vivo miR-155 activation in chronic HCV infection.
Methods
Monocyte isolation and stimulation
Monocytes were isolated from normal healthy controls
and HCV infected patients using Ficoll-Paque density
gradient centrifugation as described [16]. The patient in￾formation is given in detail in Table 1. Written consents
were obtained from the blood donors enrolled in the
study. The protocol for collecting blood is approved by
the "Institutional Review Board" (IRB), called the "Com￾mittee for the Protection of Human Subjects in Re￾search" at UMMS. LPS and CL075 were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich and Invivogen respectively. HCV NS3,
NS5 and core recombinant proteins were purchased
from BioDesign (USA). The experiment was set up in
duplicates from the monocytes of healthy individuals.
The LPS contamination of recombinant proteins was
<0.01 EU/ml, detected by Limulus amebocyte assay as
described earlier [10]. HCV E2 recombinant protein was
obtained from MassBiologics (Boston, MA, USA) and
contained undetectable endotoxin levels.
RNA isolation and PCR analyses
Total RNA was isolated with the miRNeasy kit
(Qiagen). For mRNA analysis, RNA was transcribed into
cDNA using Promega’s reverse transcription kit (Pro￾mega) and quantitative analyses of genes were

delta-delta Ct method.
miRNA analyses
TaqMan miRNA Assays (Applied Biosystems) were
employed for the detection of miRNAs as described
[17]. In monocytes, RNU48 was used to normalize the
Ct values between the samples. Serum samples were col￾lected into serum separator tubes (BD Biosciences), cen￾trifuged at 2000 rpm, aliquoted and stored at -80°C.
100ul of serum from healthy controls and patient sam￾ples was used for total RNA isolation with miRNeasy kit
(Qiagen). Synthetic C. elegans (cel)-miR-39 was spiked
during the total RNA isolation process and used to
normalize the real time PCR data. All PCR reactions
were performed in duplicates, and miRNA data from
serum samples was repeated twice. The patient informa￾tion is given in Table 2.
Statistical analysis
The non-parametric Mann–Whitney test or two-tailed
t-test was employed for statistical analysis and p value
less than 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
MiR-155 expression is increased in monocytes of
treatment-naïve patients with chronic HCV infection
Previous studies demonstrated that increased monocyte
TNFα production in chronic HCV infection is causally
linked to the presence of the HCV virus, circulating
HCV core protein, and LPS [6,18]. Here we investigated
patients with chronic HCV infection (cHCV) who were
treatment-naïve and had detectable virus, sustained viro￾logical responder patients who have successfully cleared
HCV infection after receiving standard therapy (HCV￾responders), and healthy individuals as controls. We
found that circulating monocytes of cHCV patients had
significantly higher levels of miR-155 compared to sus￾tained responders or normal controls (Figure 1A). In
vitro LPS stimulation revealed that monocytes from
cHCV patients had significantly higher LPS-induced
miR-155 levels compared to normal control monocytes
(Figure 1B).
While miR-155 increases TNFα production, miR-125b
and miR-146a have negative regulatory effects on TNFα
[15,19]. We found reduced miR-125b and no change in
miR-146a in monocytes of patients with cHCV com￾pared to HCV-responders and normal controls
(Figure 2A and B).
Increased TNFα and TLR8 expression in monocytes of
HCV infected patients
In a previous study, we reported increased TNFα pro￾duction by monocytes from patients with cHCV [6].
Here, we also found increased TNFα mRNA expression
in monocytes of cHCV patients (Figure 3A). Because
increased TNFα production could be induced by ligands
for TLR4 (LPS, NS5), TLR2 (HCV core and NS3 pro￾teins) or TLR8 (single-stranded RNA), we evaluated the
expression of these TLRs in monocytes. We found no
difference in baseline TLR4 expression between mono￾cytes from cHCV infected patients and normal controls,
and TLR4 mRNA was decreased in both groups after
LPS stimulation (Figure 3B). In contrast, TLR8 mRNA
levels were significantly higher in monocytes from
cHCV-infected patients and showed upregulation after
an in vitro LPS challenge (Figure 3C). There were no
significant changes in TLR1, TLR2 and TLR6 levels in
monocytes between cHCV and normal controls with or
without LPS stimulation (data not shown).
HCV core, NS3 and NS5 proteins and TLR4 and TLR8
ligands increase miR-155 levels in human monocytes
MicroRNA-155 has recently been identified as a positive
regulator of TNFα production [19]. Because increased
expression of TNFα in the liver and in blood monocytes
was previously found in cHCV and TLR ligands, and
HCV proteins were shown to induce TNFα in mono￾cytes, we tested the effect of these TLR ligands on
miR-155 induction [6,10,20]. Here we found increased
miR-155 levels in normal monocytes after stimulation
with the TLR4 ligand, LPS (Figure 4A). HCV is a single
stranded RNA virus that can be recognized by TLR7

and/or TLR8 of which TLR8 is expressed in monocytes
[10,16]. We found that the TLR8 ligand, CLO75,
increased miR-155 levels in monocytes compared to un￾stimulated cells (Figure 4A). Multiple mechanisms have
been suggested for increased TNFα production in mono￾cytes of patients with chronic HCV infection including
circulating HCV core protein [6,9,21]. Our results show
that stimulation with recombinant HCV core or NS3 or
NS5 proteins significantly increased monocyte miR-155
expression in normal human monocytes (Figure 4A). In
contrast, E2 (viral envelop protein, E2) failed to induce
miR-155 expression in monocytes (Figure 4A). Parallel to
miR-155 induction, LPS, CLO75, HCV core, NS3 and
NS5 all induced significant increases in TNFα mRNA
(Figure 4B) and protein levels (Figure 4C). Furthermore,
we found that E2 protein also resulted in a moderate but
significant increase in TNFα, both at mRNA and protein
levels (Figure 4B & C).
Increased miR-155 in the serum of patients with chronic
HCV infection
Increasing evidence suggests that circulating micro￾RNAs may serve as biomarkers in disease conditions
[22]. Here we tested serum levels of miR-155 and found
a statistically significant increase in serum miR-155 levels
in patients with chronic HCV infection (cHCV) com￾pared to normal controls (Figure 5A). Serum levels of
miR-125b and miR-146a were also increased in cHCV
patients compared to normal controls (Figure 5B and C).
Increased levels of miR-122 in the serum of patients with
chronic HCV infection
Elevated serum or plasma miR-122 has been found in
correlation with liver injury in recent studies [23-26].
We found that patients with chronic HCV infection had
significantly increased serum miR-122 levels compared
to controls (Figure 6A). In the same patients, serum

levels of ALT and AST were also elevated (Figure 6B)
and this finding was consistent with the presence of
chronic HCV infection. There was a strong correlation
between serum ALT/AST and serum miR-122 increases
(Figure 6C&D). Importantly, a correlation between
serum miR-155 and miR-122 levels was found in cHCV
patients (Figure 6E). These data suggest that circulating
micro-RNAs may reflect disease activity in chronic HCV
infection.
Discussion
Chronic hepatitis from HCV infection is characterized
by ongoing immune activation and a low-grade inflam￾mation in the liver and in the periphery that accompan￾ies the liver injury [13,27]. While numerous studies
reported the presence of inflammatory cascade activa￾tion, the mechanisms that trigger and sustain the
increased TNFα and inflammatory cell activation remain
elusive [2,27,28]. Micro-RNAs have emerged as key reg￾ulators of inflammation of which miR-155 has a unique
positive regulatory effect on TNFα production [19,29].
In this report, we tested the hypothesis that micro-RNAs
are dysregulated in chronic HCV infection. We found
that treatment-naïve patients with chronic HCV infec￾tion have increased expression of miR-155 in their circu￾lating monocytes that are the major sources of TNFα
production. Importantly, miR-155 levels were not
increased in monocytes from patients who have success￾fully cleared HCV infection after therapy, suggesting a
possible correlation between increased miR-155 and
HCV viral presence and/or replication. We also found
that cHCV monocytes have increased mRNA expression
of TLR8, a receptor for single-stranded RNA and
showed that in normal monocytes not only TLR4 and
TLR8 ligands but HCV core, NS3 and NS5 proteins
induced miR-155 upregulation. MiR-155 was elevated
both in the monocytes and in the serum compartment
in chronic HCV infection, and this occurred in the pres￾ence of increased serum miR-122. Together, our results
suggest that miR-155 upregulation in HCV infection in
monocytes may contribute to the increased pro￾inflammatory state and raises the possibility that circu￾lating miRNAs could serve as disease markers.
Increased miR-155 levels in circulating monocytes of
HCV patients may have several implications for disease
development and progression. First, miR-155 over￾0

expression in monocytes and macrophages has been
shown to sensitize to stimulation with LPS [17,19]. In￾deed, we not only found increased baseline miRNA-155
expression but also a significant upregulation of miR-155
after in vitro LPS challenge in cHCV infection. Previous
studies from our and other laboratories demonstrated
that monocytes from chronic HCV infected patients have
increased baseline TNFα production as well as hyper￾responsiveness to ex vivo stimulation with LPS, suggest￾ing that increased miR-155 levels may contribute to the
over-activation of the pro-inflammatory phenotype of
monocytes. This notion is supported by reports where
knock-down of miR-155 or miR-155-deficient mice
showed attenuated TNFα production to LPS stimulation
[17,30,31]. Intriguingly, various studies have demon￾strated TNFα as a positive regulator of miR-155, indicat￾ing a positive feed back regulation [32]. Based on our
results, it is tempting to speculate that increased miR￾155 sensitizes monocytes to a TLR-induced trigger for
TNFα production in active HCV infection. In parallel to
our work, a recent study showed that expression of BIC
gene, a precursor of mature miR-155, was increased in
PBMCs of HCV-infected patients [33]. They further
demonstrated that the highest expression of BIC was
found in patients harboring HCV RNA in serum and
PBMCs whereas lowest BIC expression was observed in
patients that eliminated HCV RNA from both serum
and PBMCs after anti-viral treatment, suggesting a cor￾relation between HCV RNA and precursor levels of
miR-155 [33]. Moreover, a correlation between miR-155
expression and HCV replication has been demonstrated
in PBMCs of chronic hepatitis C patients [34]. Our find￾ings further indicate an increase of mature miR-155 in
monocytes and serum of cHCV patients. Although we
found no significant changes in miR-146a levels in
monocytes of cHCV patients, some of patients who had
higher miR-146a levels also showed higher levels of
miR-155 and miR-125b. A large-scale clinical study
might answer if the variability between miRNAs corre￾lates with HCV viral load or progression of HCV
infection.
Our observations also suggest that HCV-related TLR
ligands provide the possible mechanisms for in vivo in￾duction of miR-155 and monocyte activation in cHCV
patients [13]. For example, high levels of HCV core pro￾tein as well as LPS are present in patients with cHCV
[6,35]. Our data show that both HCV core protein and
LPS induce miR-155 in normal monocytes. It has been
shown that HCV core protein can activate monocytes
and DCs via TLR2 and the complement C1q receptor
[9,18]. In addition, HCV NS3 protein that activates
TLR2, also increased monocyte miR-155 in our hands. A
recent study reported the induction of TNFα in response
to NS5 (non-structural viral protein) treatment in

human Kupffer cells [11]. In agreement with this study,
we found induction of miR-155 and TNFα in monocytes
treated with NS5. NS5 has been shown to activate the
TLR4 pathway [36]. Previously, it has been shown that
viral E2 protein interacts with CD81 and increases the
expression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase and
TNFα production in B cells [12]. We also found a mod￾erate increase of TNFα in monocytes treated with E2
protein without any change in miR-155 levels. Our data
suggest that viral E2 protein can induce TNFα independ￾ent of miR-155, however, further studies are needed to
confirm these findings. Finally, we found that TLR8 lig￾and activation can increase miR-155 and TNFα produc￾tion and it is feasible that HCV, as a single-stranded
RNA, induces miR-155 in monocytes via TLR8. Together
our data demonstrate that multiple, HCV-associated
TLR ligands are likely to be involved in miR-155 induc￾tion in cHCV infection.
We not only found increased miR-155 and miR-122
levels in the serum of cHCV patients but levels of
miR-125b and miR-146a were also increased. Increased
circulating miR-125b levels have been found in various
cancers and recently, it has been reported that
increased circulating miR-125b levels were associated
with chemotherapeutic resistance in breast cancer [37].
The significance of increased miR-125b in HCV
patients awaits further investigation. Circulating miR￾146a levels were shown to be increased in patients
with type 2 diabetes [38]. Interestingly, HCV is known
to induce type 2 diabetes [39], and it is tempting to
speculate that increased miR-146a in the circulation
might predispose the individuals to HCV infection or
vice versa.
Although, there are many studies depicting the
increased circulating miRNAs in various etiologies, the
source of circulating miRNAs is not as clear. The liver is
a complex organ where various cell types reside and
interact in close vicinity. In our study, there could be
multiple factors that contribute to induction of miRNAs
(miR-122, miR-155, miR-146a and miR-125b) in the cir￾culation during HCV infection. The possibility that these
miRNAs are either released from immune cells in a
non-specific manner or are released from different cell
types in a cell-specific manner in response to HCV in￾fection cannot be ruled out. It is most likely that miR￾122 is released from damaged hepatocytes. In agreement
with this, we found increased levels of miR-122 in the
supernatant of JFH-1 or J6/JFH-1 infected HuH7.5 cells
(data not shown). Recent studies suggest that miR-155 is
not only limited to immune cells (dendritic cells, Kuffper

non-immune cells (hepatocytes, endothelial cells). We
have recently reported that chronic alcohol feeding
increases miR-155 not only in Kuffper cells but also in
hepatocytes [40], and it has been shown that alcoholic
hepatitis patients have a higher prevalence of HCV in￾fection [41]. Our preliminary results suggest a moderate
increase of miR-155 in the supernatant of JFH-1 or J6/

cells (data not shown). On the basis of these findings, it
is most likely that both immune cells and hepatocytes
contribute to increase of miR-155 in the circulation in
HCV infection. Further studies are warranted to investi￾gate the cellular source of circulating miRNAs.
Growing evidences suggest that circulating miRNAs
may be affected by age and body weight and it was
reported that levels of circulating miRNA-155 inversely
correlated with age in patients with coronary artery dis￾ease [42]. Whether these factors affect the outcome of
circulating miRNAs in HCV patients needs to be investi￾gated. Finally, we found increased miR-122 levels in the
serum of chronic HCV infected patients, which strongly
correlated with liver damage markers such as ALT and
AST. The correlation of serum miR-122 was more
robust with ALT than AST. Our results support the pre￾vious findings where a strong correlation between serum
miR-122 and ALT/AST increases has been reported
[43,44]. Interestingly, our data indicates a positive

correlation between serum miR-155, an inflammation￾related miRNA, and miR-122, a hepatocyte-specific
micro-RNA. We speculate that this could be related to
inflammation-induced hepatocyte damage that occurs in
chronic HCV infection. In our patient cohort, there was
no significant correlation between ALT values and serum
miR-155 expression. Further investigation of serum
miRNAs and their role as diagnostic biomarkers or bio￾logical mediators deserves attention.
Conclusions
Our study demonstrates that monocytes have increased
miR-155 expression and increased TNFα production in
patients with chronic HCV infection. The observation
that miR-155 is induced in monocytes by TLR4 and
TLR8 stimulation as well as by HCV core, NS3 and NS5
proteins suggests potential mechanisms for in vivo miR￾155 induction in chronic HCV infection. Our finding of
increased serum miR-155 and miR-122 and their correl￾ation implies that microRNAs deserve investigations as
potential biomarkers in disease activity.
