Abstract
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of abnormal liver enzymes in both adults and
children. NAFLD has a histologic spectrum ranging from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH),
advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis. It is imperative to distinguish simple steatosis from NASH since the latter has a
progressive disease course and can lead to end-stage liver disease. Liver biopsy has been considered as the gold
standard for the diagnosis of NASH. However, liver biopsy is invasive, costly, and can rarely cause significant
morbidity (risk of morbidity, 0.06-0.35%; risk of mortality, 0.1-0.01%). Imaging studies such as ultrasonography,
computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging have limited sensitivity in detecting steatosis and cannot
distinguish steatosis from NASH. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) has been used as a surrogate marker for liver
injuries. However, ALT is not an ideal marker for either diagnosis of NAFLD or distinguishing steatosis from NASH.
Better noninvasive biomarkers or panels of biomarkers that are cheaper, reliable, and reproducible are urgently
needed for patients with NASH to assist in establishing diagnosis, providing risk information, and monitoring
disease progression and treatment response. In this article, we plan to concisely review the current advances in the
use of biomarkers for the diagnosis of NASH.

Introduction
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most
common cause of abnormal liver function test results in
both adults and children [1,2]. NAFLD in fact covers a
histological spectrum ranging from simple steatosis to
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), advanced fibrosis,
and cirrhosis [1]. Simple steatosis without fibrosis or
inflammation has a benign clinical course in most but not
in all cases without excess mortality [3]. NASH, on the
other hand, may have a more progressive course that can
lead to cirrhosis in 10-15% of patients [4]. Survival is
lower in patients with NASH based on the findings from
long-term longitudinal studies [3,5]. It is therefore impera￾tive to distinguish simple steatosis from NASH in order to
provide risk stratification and intervention slowing down
disease progression for patients with the latter condition.
Liver biopsy remains the gold standard for making the
diagnosis of NASH. However, this procedure is invasive,
costly, and is associated with rare but potential complica￾tions and sampling errors. Hence it is not suitable as a
screening tool for a condition that affects one-third of the
American population [6]. Imaging studies such as ultraso￾nography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic
resonance imaging have been used to diagnose NAFLD.
These modalities have the advantages of being noninvasive
and can be repetitively performed over a period of time.
Nevertheless, none of them have sufficient sensitivity
and specificity for staging the disease and cannot
distinguish between simple steatosis and NASH with
or without fibrosis [6].
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) has been used as a
surrogate marker for liver injury. Several studies suggested
that ALT is not an ideal biomarker for either diagnosis of
NAFLD or distinguishing simple steatosis from NASH. In
a cross-sectional population study, examining hepatic
steatosis based on the measurement of hepatic triglyceride
content by magnetic resonance spectroscopy, nearly one￾third (31%) of the subjects had hepatic steatosis. Most of
the subjects with steatosis (79%) had normal serum ALT
levels [7]. In another study, 58 of 80 (72.5%) patients who

had a normal ALT and underwent surgery unrelated to
liver diseases had varying degrees of NASH. Among those
patients, 26 had fibrosis and 8 had silent cirrhosis [8]. The
third study reported that the entire histologic spectrum of
NAFLD could be seen in the individuals with normal
ALT values. The histological spectrum of NAFLD in
people with NAFLD and normal ALT was not significantly
different from those with NAFLD and elevated ALT. A low
normal ALT value therefore does not guarantee freedom
from underlying NASH with advanced fibrosis [9].
As mentioned earlier, the current available tests have
significant limitations in distinguishing simple steatosis
from NASH, which has important clinical implications.
Better noninvasive biomarkers or panels of biomarkers
that are cheaper, reliable, and reproducible are urgently
needed for patients with NASH to assist in establishing
diagnosis, providing risk information, and monitoring
disease progression and treatment response. In this article,
we plan to concisely review the current advances in the
use of biomarkers for the diagnosis of NASH.
Proinflammatory markers and NASH
NAFLD is considered to be the hepatic manifestation of
metabolic syndrome (MetS) [10]. Obesity, a common
feature of NAFLD and MetS, is associated with a chronic
and subacute inflammatory state that is both systemic
and focally localized in certain tissues such as liver. Con￾sistent with the potential roles of inflammation, serum
levels of proinflammatory cytokines are elevated in obese
subjects [11]. NASH is a progressive form of NAFLD
where in addition to simple steatosis, inflammation, hep￾atocyte ballooning, and sometimes, fibrosis are observed
[12]. It is therefore of great interest to determine if
NASH can be distinguished from simple steatosis by
using proinflammatory biomarkers. Below we will dis￾cuss the current findings of the use of proinflammatory
biomarkers for the diagnosis of NASH.
Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)
TNF-α plays an important role in insulin resistance, the
pathognomonic feature of MetS, through inhibiting the
tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor [13].
Abiru et al. reported that patients with NASH had
significantly higher serum TNF-α and its soluble recep￾tor (sTNFR1) than those with simple steatosis, although
they did not provide a cutoff value of the cytokine for
clinical use [14]. A recent study further reported that
patients with NASH had higher levels of TNF-α messen￾ger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) than healthy controls. The
authors proposed a TNF-α mRNA cutoff value of
100 ng/mL predicted NASH [area under receiver opera￾ting characteristic curves (AUROC) 0.685, sensitivity
66.7%, specificity 74.1%] [15]. The role of TNF-α in
NASH is further supported by the beneficial effects of
pentoxifylline, an antagonizer of TNF-α, on biochemical
and histological activity associated with NASH [16-18].
Interleukin-6 (IL-6)
IL-6 is implicated in insulin resistance, at least in part,
through the induction of suppressor of cytokine signaling-3
in liver [19]. Several studies have reported a strong asso￾ciation between IL-6 and NASH. In a pilot study with a
small cohort, patients with NASH received special diet plus
exercise with or without antioxidant vitamin E (800 IU/day
for 6 weeks). Plasma IL-6 levels were significantly higher in
patients with NASH and the levels decreased with the the￾rapy [20]. Not only the cytokine itself, but its soluble recep￾tor is also significantly increased in patients with NASH
than those with simple steatosis [14]. No cutoff value of the
cytokine for differentiating NASH from simple steatosis
was provided from either one of the studies. In the third
small cohort study, morbidly obese patients were divided
into 3 groups based on the histologic findings: non-NASH,
probable NASH, and NASH. IL-6 level was correlated with
the degree of steatosis until the patients met the criteria of
NASH when their blood IL-6 levels decreased. Multivariate
logistic regression analysis identified the level of IL-6
> 4.81 pg/mL [odds ratio (OR): 33.7, 95% confidence
interval (CI): 1.7-680.7, p ≤ 0.022] as an independent
predictor of the degree of steatosis but not of NASH [21].
In the fourth study, NASH could be well distinguished
from simple steatosis when using the cutoff value of IL-6
at 4.6 pg/mL (AUROC 0.817, sensitivity 58.1%, specificity
100%). The authors concluded that IL-6 was highly specific
in confirming the absence of NASH at normal values [22].
C-reactive protein (CRP)
CRP levels were elevated in NAFLD patients compared
with controls matched by age and body mass index
(BMI) and hence were reported to be an independent
risk factor for NAFLD [23]. However, the study was
limited by the lack of histologic diagnosis since NAFLD
was diagnosed based on elevated ALT and sonographic
evidence of fatty liver. It is still controversial whether
CRP can differentiate NASH from simple steatosis. For
example, high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) levels were sig￾nificantly higher in patients with NASH compared with
those with steatosis in a Japanese study [24]. In addition,
hs-CRP levels were significantly elevated in patients with
NASH and advanced fibrosis compared with those with
NASH and mild fibrosis. However, there was no relation
between serum hs-CRP levels and either hepatic steato￾sis or necroinflammation grade. The AUROC for distin￾guishing between NASH and steatosis using hs-CRP was
0.833 [24]. In a Romanian study, CRP had an excellent
performance in predicting the presence of NASH using
a cutoff value of 3.5 mg/L (AUROC 0.906, sensitivity
Pearce et al. Biomarker Research 2013, 1:7 Page 2 of 11
http://www.biomarkerres.org/content/1/1/7

82%, specificity 88%). CRP, however, was not a predictor
of severe fibrosis (F ≥ 3) in that study [25].
In contrast, a small cohort study (18 patients with
NASH) reported that there was no correlation of CRP
levels with either the degree of hepatic steatosis, inflam￾mation, or the stage of liver fibrosis despite the fact that
NASH patients had significantly higher CRP levels
than 16 controls [26]. Similar to the previous study,
an Australian group reported that patients with
NASH and simple steatosis had similar hs-CRP levels.
No relationship existed between hs-CRP levels and
the grades of hepatic steatosis, necroinflammation,
and fibrosis [27]. Both studies are underpowered due
to inadequate sample sizes.
CRP may be a marker of hepatic steatosis but not of
severity of NAFLD in obese patients [28].
Pentraxin 3 (PTX3)
PTX3 is a prototypic member of the long chain pentraxin
family and a newly discovered marker of the acute phase
inflammatory response. PTX3 is structurally related to,
but distinct from classic members of the short chain
pentraxin family, including CRP [29]. Yoneda et al. [29]
first reported that the plasma PTX3 level was significantly
higher in patients with NASH than those with simple stea￾tosis or healthy controls. No significant difference of
plasma PTX3 levels was observed between the simple
steatosis and control groups. A stepwise increase in
plasma PTX3 levels was found as the stages of hepatic
fibrosis increased. PTX3, however, was not related to
either hepatic steatosis or necroinflammation grade. Using
1.61 ng/mL as a cutoff value, PTX3 had a fair perfor￾mance in differentiating NASH from simple steatosis
(AUROC 0.755, sensitivity 66.7%, specificity 78.6%). Using
2.45 ng/mL as a cutoff value, PTX3 had a good perfor￾mance in distinguishing stage 3–4 from stage 0–2 NAFLD
(AUROC 0.850, sensitivity 70.6%, specificity 94.3%) [29].
Ferritin
Increased ferritin but normal transferrin saturation is
frequently found in patients with hepatic steatosis. The
simultaneous disorder of iron and glucose and/or lipid
metabolism, in most of the cases associated with insulin
resistance, is responsible for persistent hyperferritinemia
and identifies patients at risk for NASH [30]. Indeed,
serum ferritin level was significantly higher in the NASH
patients than those with simple steatosis, according to a
Japanese study [31]. In that study, the serum ferritin
level was related with insulin resistance. The perfor￾mance of serum ferritin for distinguishing NASH from
simple steatosis was fair (AUROC 0.732) and the optimal
cutoff value was 196 ng/mL with a sensitivity 64.2% and
specificity 76.5%. In another study, the performance of
serum ferritin for detecting NASH was improved (AUROC
0.82) when using a higher cutoff value 240 ng/mL with the
price of losing specificity (sensitivity 91%, specificity 70%)
[32]. In a recent large cohort study using gender-specific
cutoff values (> 300 ng/mL in women and > 450 ng/mL
for men), serum ferritin levels greater than 1.5 times of
upper limit of normal was associated with hepatic iron de￾position, a diagnosis of NASH, and worsened histologic
activity, and is an independent predictor of advanced hep￾atic fibrosis among patients with NAFLD. The authors
concluded that serum ferritin is useful to identify NAFLD
patients at risk for NASH and advanced fibrosis [33]. A re￾cent report from Japan stated that the extent of serum fer￾ritin elevations did not predict the stage of NAFLD
although hyperferritinemia was common in NAFLD
patients. The study is limited by a possible selection bias
since only 19% of the study subjects had a histologic diag￾nosis [34].
In summary, a variety of proinflammatory biomarkers
such as TNF-α, IL-6, CRP, and ferritin have been studied
for their associations with NASH. Their performance in
distinguishing NASH from simple steatosis is either fair or
good but not excellent. Controversies of the association of
each proinflammatory marker with NASH exist and well
accepted cutoff values of each marker remain unknown.
Constituents of extracellular matrix (ECM)
Liver fibrosis is one of the features of NASH [12]. The
constituents of ECM are expected to be released into
circulation during turnover of fibrosis in the liver. It is
therefore reasonable using such markers to differentiate
NASH from simple steatosis, especially those with
significant liver fibrosis.
Yoneda et al. reported that marked elevation of serum
hyaluronic acid (HA) and type IV collagen 7S domain,
both ECM components, occurred in NASH patients
with advanced fibrosis compared to those with mild
fibrosis [24]. Serum HA levels were also markedly
elevated in patients with NASH than with steatosis only.
No cutoff value of either marker was provided in the study
[24]. Another study reported that the best cutoff values to
detect NASH using ROC analysis were ≥ 43 ng/mL for
HA (AUROC 0.797) and ≥ 5 ng/mL for type IV collagen
7S domain (AUROC 0.828). The positive predictive value
(PPV) for detecting NASH can be as high as 97.1%
when both markers are greater than the cutoffs. In
addition, the best cutoff values to detect severe fibrosis
were ≥ 50 ng/mL for HA (AUROC 0.797) and ≥ 5 ng/mL
for type IV collagen 7S domain (AUROC 0.817). The study
reported that severe hepatic fibrosis is unlikely to be
present if both markers are concomitantly less than the
cutoffs [35]. In a study including only NASH patients,
those with liver fibrosis had significantly higher serum HA
and laminin levels than those without fibrosis. The best
cutoff value was 148.8 ng/mL for HA (AUROC 0.975,
Pearce et al. Biomarker Research 2013, 1:7 Page 3 of 11
http://www.biomarkerres.org/content/1/1/7

sensitivity 97.5%, specificity 95.7%) and was 292.5 ng/mL
for laminin (AUROC 0.789, sensitivity 73.9%, specificity
74.1%). The authors concluded that HA could be a pre￾dictive factor of the presence and stage of liver fibrosis in
NASH. Laminin could be used to diagnose liver fibrosis
but has no value in staging [36].
In contrast to the aforementioned findings, Malik
et al. reported that there was no difference in levels of fi￾brosis markers such as HA, YKL-40, and tissue inhibitor
of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1) between patients with
NASH and with simple steatosis [37]. Similar to the pre￾vious study, a recent study reported that neither HA,
TIMP1, YKL-40, nor collagen IV was associated with a
histologic diagnosis of NASH. Pro-collagen III (PIIINP)
was the only marker that was correlated with the total
NAFLD activity score (NAS) and its constituent compo￾nents. PIIINP was able to discriminate between patients
with simple steatosis and those with NASH or advanced
fibrosis with AUROC 0.85-0.87 [38].
In summary, ECM constituents seem to be decent
markers for the detection of NASH although not without
controversy. These markers are limited for routine use as
they are not readily available in clinical laboratories. For
better detection performances, these markers are often
incorporated into diagnostic panels that are composed of
several biomarkers. We will discuss these panels later in
this review.
Apoptosis markers
Apoptosis is a common mechanism of liver injury.
Feldstein et al. [39] reported that the number of apoptotic
cells was significantly increased in liver biopsy specimens
from patients with NASH compared with those with simple
steatosis and healthy controls. Immunohistochemistry
demonstrated active caspases 3 and 7 in NASH specimens,
confirming the occurrence of apoptosis in this condition.
The apoptotic pathway is composed of two arms: the in￾trinsic pathway (initiated by cellular stress) and the extrinsic
pathway (stimulated through a death receptor-mediated
process). Both pathways are suspected to be involved in the
pathogenesis of NASH [40]. In the final common step of
apoptosis, the effector caspases (especially caspase 3 and
caspase 7) are activated and cleave a number of different
substrates inside the cell, including cytokeratin 18 (CK18),
the major intermediate filament protein in the liver [41].
Plasma CK18 fragments were found to be markedly
increased in patients with NASH (n=21) than those with
simple steatosis (n=8) or normal controls (n=10) [median
(interquartile range): 765.7 U/L (479.6-991.1), 202.4 U/L
(160.4-258.2), 215.5 U/L (150.2-296.2), respectively;
p < 0.001] [41]. A cutoff value of 395 U/L performed
excellently for the diagnosis of NASH (AUROC 0.93,
sensitivity 85.7, specificity 99.9%). For every 50 U/L
increase in CK18 levels, the likelihood of having
“definitive NASH” increased 86% (OR 1.86; 95% CI 1.23-2.82)
[41]. By studying a larger cohort, the same group validated
the significantly higher plasma CK18 fragments in patients
with NASH (n=69) versus those without NASH (n=44)
and borderline diagnosis (n=26) [median (25th, 75th per￾centile), 335 (196, 511), 194 (151, 270), 200 (148, 284),
respectively; p<0.001]. The AUROC for NASH diagnosis
was estimated to be 0.83 [42]. A Greek study reported that
fragmented CK18 levels had a good diagnostic accuracy
for differentiating patients with NASH (n=30) from those
with simple steatosis (n=28; AUROC 0.87). Levels of
CK18 fragments ≥225 U/L, ≥ 250 U/L, or ≥ 300 U/L
had sensitivity of 70%, 60%, or 53%; specificity of
82%, 93%, or 100%; PPV of 84%, 95%, or 100%; and
negative predictive value (NPV) of 73%, 69%, or 67%
for the diagnosis of NASH, respectively [43]. Using
paired liver biopsies, serum CK18 fragment levels cor￾related with NAS in NAFLD patients [44]. The find￾ing suggests that serum CK18 fragment levels can be
used for monitoring NAFLD disease activity and treat￾ment responses.
Two studies suggested that CK18 fragments may have
a better performance for the diagnosis of NASH when
combining with other tests [45,46]. First, a Turkish study
reported that serum CK18 fragments had a fair per￾formance in discriminating NASH from non-NASH
(i.e., borderline NASH, simple steatosis, normal tissue)
when using 121.6 U/L as the cutoff value (AUROC 0.787,
sensitivity 60%, specificity 97.4). Using 243.8 U/L as the
cutoff value, total serum CK18 levels had a better sensiti￾vity and worse specificity than its apoptotic fragments for
the diagnosis of NASH (AUROC 0.809, sensitivity 68.9,
specificity 81.6). When combining CK18 with the liver
attenuation on CT in Hounsfield units, both total CK18
and its apoptotic fragments had higher sensitivity (83.3%
and 86.1%, respectively) for definitive NASH. The authors
suggested that measurement of different forms of CK18 in
combination with CT has greater diagnostic utility for the
identification of patients with definitive NASH than the
use of either test alone [45]. Second, a study from a group
in Hong Kong reported a 2-step approach using CK18
fragments and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) further
improved the accuracy in diagnosing NASH. In that study,
at cutoffs of 203 and 670 U/L, serum CK18 fragments had
a 71% NPV and 77% PPV to exclude and diagnose NASH.
A 2-step approach measuring CK18 followed by FGF21
further improved the NPV to 74% and PPV to 82% [46].
Joka et al. [47] reported that both total serum CK18
and CK18 fragments could accurately differentiate
healthy controls or simple steatosis from NASH and
discriminate patients with different fibrosis stages from
healthy controls. However, total CK18 levels had a better
diagnostic performance and even differentiation between
lower fibrosis stages as well as between healthy

http://www.biomarkerres.org/content/1/1/7

individuals and patients with simple steatosis than the
apoptotic CK18 fragments [47].
In summary, NASH is associated with an increase in
apoptotic activity in the liver. CK18 fragments are promi￾sing noninvasive biomarkers for the diagnosis of NASH.
Based on the data from the paired biopsy study, serum
levels of CK18 fragments can be possibly used to monitor
liver disease activity and responses to treatment in
patients with NASH.
Diagnostic panels for NASH and advanced liver fibrosis
The diagnostic panels for NAFLD can be divided to two
categories, one for the prediction of NASH and the
other for the detection of liver fibrosis.
Panels for the detection of NASH
Different diagnostic panels for NASH are shown in
Table 1. According to the HAIR scoring system, a
weighted score of 2 or 3 is highly predictive of NASH.
However, the study was confined to those with a BMI
> 35 kg/m2 and the results may not be applicable to those
with a lower BMI [48]. In the model reported by Palekar
et al., patients with three or more of the following six
characteristics are more likely to have NASH than simple
steatosis: female gender, age ≥ 50 years, BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2
,
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≥ 45 U/L, AST/ALT
ratio ≥ 0.8, and HA ≥55 mcg/L [49]. Combining 13 clinical
and biochemical parameters, the NashTest only had a fair
performance (AUROC 0.78) but a very good specificity
(94%) for predicting NASH [50]. Comparing with the
NashTest, Gholam et al. was able to predict NASH in a
severely obese cohort (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2
) by simply
using two markers, AST and the presence of diabetes
(AUROC 0.82) [51].
Obstructive sleep apnea has been shown to improve
diagnostic accuracy of the panels for NASH [52,53]. The
NASH Clinical Scoring System for Morbid Obesity is
consisted of six components including hypertension,
type 2 diabetes, AST ≥ 27 U/L, ALT ≥ 27 U/L, sleep
apnea, and non-black race. Two points are assigned to
non-black race and one point is assigned to the rest of the
five components. The probability of NASH is determined
based on the summed points. A cohort of morbidly obese
patients (n=186) was divided into four categories based on
the probability of NASH (low, intermediate, high, and very
high). Both the PPV of the very high-risk category and the
NPV of the low-risk category for NASH were 93% and the
AUROC was 0.8 [52]. A simplified scoring model based
on only four variables including type 2 diabetes, ALT > 40
U/L, triglyceride > 150 mg/dL, and obstructive sleep apnea
was reported by Ulitsky et al. [53]. Similar to the design of
the previous study, two points are assigned to diabetes
and one point is assigned to the other three variables. A
cohort of morbidly obese patients (n=235) was divided
into four groups based on the risk of NASH determined
by the summed points (low, intermediate, high, and very
high). The model performed similarly to the previous
study (AUROC 0.76 vs. 0.8) [52,53]. Both studies sug￾gested that a liver biopsy should be recommended for
morbidly obese individuals who are in the high and very
high-risk categories for NASH. On the other hand, a liver
biopsy can be delayed or avoided for individuals with a
low risk of NASH [52,53].
Shimada et al. reported that approximately 90% of the
patients with early-stage NASH can be predicted by a
combined evaluation of the serum adiponectin level,
homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance
(HOMA-IR), and serum type IV collagen 7S level [54].
Both adiponectin and resistin are adipokines mainly pro￾duced by adipose tissues and both are involved in insulin
resistance. Hypoadiponectinemia is commonly seen in
patients with NAFLD [55]. Tarek et al. developed a panel
that consisted of 2 apoptosis markers (CK18 fragments
and soluble Fas) for NASH [56]. In the initial cohort that
included patients suspicious for having NASH, the panel
performed quite well with an AUROC 0.93. In the vali￾dation cohort that included morbidly obese patients
only, the panel still had a fair performance with an
AUROC 0.79. The high AUROC in the validation group
indicated that this panel provides reproducible results
even for a highly distinct group of patients [56].
Given the complexity of the pathogenesis of NASH, it
is likely that multiple pathways may play critical roles in
the development of the disease. Younossi et al. therefore
developed the NASH diagnostics model that includes
two apoptosis markers (apoptosis- and necrosis-derived
CK18 fragments) and two adipokines (adiponectin and
resistin) [57]. If the model were used to minimize the
use of liver biopsies at the threshold of 0.2085, 79.2% of
the study patients could avoid the invasive procedure.
Again, the study subjects were morbidly obese and the
study results may not be generalized to non-obese popu￾lation [57]. Sookoian et al. designed a diagnostic panel
based on a composite index using nine markers derived
from both clinical and routine laboratory data [58]. Con￾sidering a model patient with all the positive tests, the
post-test probability for NASH would be 99.5%. In the
same way, considering a model with all negative tests,
the post-test probability for NASH would be negligible
(0.3%). Nevertheless, the performance of the model was
only fair (AUROC 0.795) [58].
Based on the head-to-head comparison studies, two
panels were reported outperforming several other
existed panels previously mentioned. First, the NAFIC
scoring system using the following markers: serum
ferritin (≥ 200 ng/mL for female; ≥ 300 ng/mL for male),
fasting insulin (≥10 μU/mL), and type IV collagen 7S
(≥ 5 ng/mL), outperformed the HAIR scoring system

[48] and the scoring system developed by Palekar
et al. [49] and Gholam et al. [51] for differentiating
NASH from simple steatosis [59]. The study results,
however, may not be adaptable for NAFLD patients
of other races since all participants of the study were
Japanese. Second, the NAFLD Diagnostic Panel using
five markers: diabetes, gender, BMI, triglycerides,
apoptotic and necrotic CK18 fragments, had a better
performance than the NASH Diagnostics for predic￾ting histologic NASH [60]. The study participants in
both studies had similar BMIs and both panels
included CK18 fragments as a marker [57,60].
Panels for the detection of advanced liver fibrosis
Several diagnostic panels have been developed for the pre￾diction of significant liver fibrosis (Table 2). Angulo et al.
suggested that NASH patients who are older (≥ 45 years),
obese (BMI >31.1 kg/m2 for male, > 32.3 kg/m2 for
female), and suffer from diabetes mellitus are at greatest
risk of progressing to cirrhosis with its consequent

complications. They also proposed that patients with
those characteristics should be greatly encouraged to
undergo liver biopsy so intervention can be offered [61].
The BAAT scoring system is calculated as the sum of the
following parameters: age at liver biopsy (≥ 50 years = 1;
< 50 years = 0), BMI (≥28 kg/m2 = 1; < 28 kg/m2 = 0),
triglycerides (≥1.7 mmol/L = 1; <1.7 mmol/L = 0), and
ALT (≥ 2 times of normal = 1; < 2 times of normal = 0). A
score of 0 or 1 had 100% NPV for the diagnosis of septal
fibrosis and cirrhosis [62]. The European Liver Fibrosis
Group studied 1021 subjects who had a variety of chronic
liver diseases and came up with the Original European
Liver Fibrosis panel (OELF). The panel consists of age and
three serum markers, HA, TIMP1, and PIIINP. For
NAFLD, fibrosis stage 3 or 4 was detectable using a
threshold value of 0.375 with a sensitivity of 89%, specifi￾city of 96%, PPV of 80%, and NPV of 98% [63]. The

OELF by simply removing age from the panel. Despite
that change, the ELF had an excellent AUROC of 0.90 for
distinguishing severe fibrosis (F0-2 vs. F3-4), good per￾formance (AUROC 0.82) for moderate fibrosis (F0-1 vs.
F2-4), and fair performance (AUROC 0.76) for no fibrosis
(F0 vs. F1-4). By using the ELF, Guha et al. reported that
82% of liver biopsies in their study could be potentially
avoided for the diagnosis of severe fibrosis [64].
The commercially available FibroTest incorporates five
serum markers, α2 macroglobulin, haptoglobin, apolipo￾protein A1, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and
total bilirubin. It has a good performance for detecting
F2 (AUROC 0.81) and F3 (AUROC 0.88) fibrosis. The
probability of cirrhosis is very low when the test score is
below 0.3. On the other hand, the patient should be
managed as a patient with cirrhosis when the score is
0.7 or higher [65]. By simply using ALT and glycosy￾lated hemoglobin A1C, Gholam et al. reported an
excellent performance (AUROC 0.90) of their model
for detection of liver fibrosis in severely obese subjects
(BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2
) [51].
The NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS) was developed from
a large cohort (n=773) and is calculated from six variables:
age, hyperglycemia, BMI, platelet count, albumin, and
AST/ALT ratio. By applying the low cutoff score (−1.455),
advanced fibrosis could be excluded with high accuracy
(NPV of 93% and 88% in the estimation and validation
groups, respectively). By applying the high cutoff score
(0.676), the presence of advanced fibrosis could be diag￾nosed with high accuracy (PPV of 90% and 82% in the
estimation and validation groups, respectively). By using
this model, Angulo et al. reported that a liver biopsy
would have been avoided in 75% of the study cohort and
with a correct prediction of 90% [66]. Since being
published, the NFS has been directly compared with
several other models. For example, the easily calculated
BARD score was reported to be at least equivalent to the
more complex NFS in excluding patients with advanced
fibrosis [67]. Depending on the presence of the following
variables, BMI ≥ 28 kg/m2 (1 point), AST/ALT ratio ≥ 0.8
(2 points), and diabetes (1 point), the BARD score ranges
from 0 to 4. A score of 2–4 was associated with an OR for
advanced fibrosis of 17 (95% CI 9.2-31.9) and a NPV of
96%. The BARD score seems to be more accurate at
predicting advanced fibrosis in non-diabetics compared
with diabetic patients [67]. The Fibrometer NAFLD, which
is computed from seven easily obtainable variables
(glucose, AST, ferritin, platelet, ALT, body weight and
age), was reported to be more accurate than the NFS [68].
The FIB4 index was reported outperforming seven other
noninvasive markers of fibrosis in patients with NAFLD,
including the NFS, based on the analysis of a multi-center
cohort [69]. A FIB4 index ≥ 2.67 had an 80% PPV and a
FIB4 index ≤1.30 had a 90% NPV of significant liver
fibrosis [69]. As mentioned previously, the NAFIC score
was developed based on a large Japanese cohort [59]. After
a direct comparison, it was concluded that the easily
determined NAFIC score was at least equivalent to the
more complex NFS. The authors further suggested that
liver biopsy can be avoided in NAFLD patients with a
NAFIC score of 0 or 1 because they are likely to have
NAFLD without advanced fibrosis. In contrast, liver
biopsy should be recommended in NAFLD patients with
an NAFIC score of ≥ 2 to assess the extent of hepatic
fibrosis and predict prognosis [59]. Finally, the NAFLD
Diagnostic Panel was directly compared with the NFS in a
recent study with a much smaller cohort [60]. For predic￾ting either any degree of fibrosis or advanced fibrosis, the
NAFLD Diagnostic Panel performed significantly better
than that of the combined ELF and NFS model and ELF
alone or NFS alone (any fibrosis and advanced fibrosis
AUROC, 0.80 and 0.81, 0.78 and 0.63, 0.76 and 0.65, 0.71
and 0.59, respectively) [60].
In summary, several diagnostic panels have been
developed for the prediction of NASH and significant
fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. Each panel is unique
for its biomarker composition. The cohorts in different
studies were heterogeneous in characteristics and some￾times highly selected, which may limit their utility in
different populations. The recent published practice
guideline recommends the NFS as a clinically useful tool
for identifying NAFLD patients with higher likelihood of
having bridging fibrosis and/or cirrhosis. In addition, the
presence of MetS and the NFS may be used for identi￾fying patients who are at risk for steatohepatitis and
advanced fibrosis [70].
Biomarkers for NAFLD defined by proteomic studies
Using the promising proteomics, a few studies have been
conducted to identify potential biomarkers for NAFLD.
By studying bariatric surgery patients (n=98), Younossi
et al. first found 12 protein peaks with significant diffe￾rential expression when sera from NAFLD groups
(n=91) were compared with obese controls (n=7) [71]. A
prospective study identified three protein peaks, which
were related to different hemoglobin subunits, progres￾sively increased in intensity from patients who were
obese but without liver lesions (n=24) to those with stea￾tosis (n=32) and NASH (n=24), but returned to near
normal value after patients had lost weight [72]. Bell
et al. reported the expression levels of 55 and 15 pro￾teins changed significantly between the simple steatosis
(n=24) and NASH with advanced fibrosis (n=22) groups
and the NASH (n=23) and NASH with advanced fibrosis
groups, respectively. There were, however, no significant
differences observed between the simple steatosis and
NASH groups, suggesting that systemic markers of fatty
liver and NASH may not be present in serum from
Pearce et al. Biomarker Research 2013, 1:7 Page 8 of 11
http://www.biomarkerres.org/content/1/1/7

patients with mild disease [73]. Those proteins were found
to be involved in immune regulation and inflammation,
coagulation, cellular and extracellular matrix structure
and function, and roles as carrier proteins in the
blood [73].
In addition to sera, proteomics have also been used in
other tissues to discover biomarkers for NAFLD. By
studying liver specimens from severely obese patients,
Charlton et al. discovered nine proteins with differential
expression between study groups [74]. Lumican, a 40-kDa
keratin sulfate proteoglycan that regulates collagen fibril
assembly and activates transforming growth factor-beta
and smooth muscle actin, was overexpressed in a progres￾sive manner in NASH-mild versus simple steatosis (124%,
p < 0.001), NASH-progressive versus NASH-mild (156%,
p < 0.001), and NASH-progressive versus obese normal
(178%, p < 0.001). Fatty acid binding protein-1, which is
protective against the detergent effects of excess fatty
acids, was underexpressed in NASH-mild versus simple
steatosis (73%, p < 0.001), NASH-progressive versus
NASH-mild (81%, p < 0.001), and NASH-progressive
versus obese normal (59%, p < 0.001) [74]. Another study
analyzed liver samples from severely obese patients and
identified two candidate markers, CPS1 and GRP78,
which were down-regulated in NASH versus normal con￾trol groups [75]. CPS1 and GRP78 were also confirmed to
be serum candidate markers of NAFLD. Their serum con￾centrations decreased gradually from control subjects to
steatosis and NASH patients [75]. By studying visceral
adipose tissue, Younossi et al. reported that a model based
on a combination of clinical and phosphoproteomic para￾meters had a good performance in predicting NASH
(AUROC 0.86, sensitivity 81.3%, specificity 87%) [76].
In contrast to the previous reports, Ulukaya et al.
reported that serum proteomic pattern analysis did not
help to distinguish NASH from simple steatosis in patients
with NAFLD [77]. Compared to the prior studies, the study
subjects had a much lower BMI, which may explain
the disparity.
In summary, proteomics is a promising technology that
can screen a large number of proteins in a high through￾put fashion. The use of proteomics in discovery of
biomarkers for NAFLD is still in early stages. Most of the
data mentioned in this section were derived from severely
obese subjects who were mainly Caucasians. The findings
need to be validated in other population in the future.
Conclusion
Several biomarkers that are associated with inflammation,
ECM, and apoptosis have been individually studied for
their performances in distinguishing NASH from simple
steatosis. Routine use of individual marker is limited
by the controversial published results and commercial
unavailability. Several panels of biomarkers in variable
combination have been developed for the detection of
either NASH and/or advanced liver fibrosis. Most of
the panels have not been validated in longitudinal
studies. The study cohorts are heterogeneous in charac￾teristics and sometimes highly selected. Future studies
should be ideally designed as population-based, prospec￾tive, and longitudinal in order to eliminate selection and
referral biases and to validate the results derived from
cross-sectional studies.
