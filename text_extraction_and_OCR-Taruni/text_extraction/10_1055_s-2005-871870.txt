MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY CASE
Iatrogenic Renal Dissection during Renal
Artery Stenting
Brian Funaki, M.D.1
Renal artery angioplasty and stenting has be￾come the initial treatment of choice for many patients
with symptomatic atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis.
Iatrogenic renal artery dissection is one of the most
feared complications and usually occurs either at the
time the lesion is crossed with a guidewire or during
dilation.
CASE REPORT
A 67-year-old woman with hypertension refractory to
medical therapy was referred for renal angioplasty. She
had undergone right renal artery stenting 1 year earlier
with good technical and clinical results.
The right femoral artery was catheterized and a
6 French (6-F) Balkan sheath was inserted over a guide￾wire. A pigtail catheter was advanced into the abdominal
aorta and aortography was performed (Fig. 1A), reveal￾ing a widely patent right renal stent and an irregular left
renal artery stenosis. Five thousand units of heparin was
administered intra-arterially and the pigtail catheter was
exchanged for a 5-F RC-1 catheter and 0.035-inch
Bentson guidewire. The orifice of the left renal artery
was catheterized and the guidewire and catheter were
advanced across the lesion. A small amount of contrast
material was injected, revealing a renal dissection
(Fig. 1B). The catheter and wire were retracted into
the aorta and an additional 3000 units of heparin was
administered.
The RC-1 catheter and Bentson guidewire were
exchanged for a VS-1 catheter and hydrophilic guide￾wire. After several minutes of manipulation, the lesion
was able to be successfully recrossed with the catheter
and guidewire. A hand injection of contrast material
demonstrated vasospasm of the intrarenal renal arteries
(Fig. 1C). A 0.035-inch Rosen guidewire was positioned
across the lesion and dissection in the distal main renal
artery. The VS-1 catheter was exchanged for a 5-mm
ultrathin angioplasty balloon catheter (Boston Scientific,
Natick, MA). The lesion was dilated for 1 minute in
an attempt to both dilate the stenosis and tack down the
dissection flap. An angiogram obtained through the 6-F
guiding catheter revealed improved but suboptimal flow
(Fig. 1D).
The angioplasty balloon catheter was exchanged
for a premounted 5 mm  20 mm balloon expandable
stent. The lesion was stented with an excellent angio￾graphic result (Fig. 1E). On follow-up, the stent has
remained patent for the past 4 years.
DISCUSSION
Although any renal artery stenosis is susceptible to
iatrogenic dissection, irregular atherosclerotic lesions
are particularly prone to this complication. In this case,
the tip of the catheter initially used to select the renal
artery presumably became wedged into the irregular
plaque. Even though a soft-tipped guidewire was then
used to cross the lesion, as it emerged from the catheter
tip, it ‘‘unroofed’’ the lesion, leading to a dissection. It is
important to realize that when any guidewire, even those
with an atraumatic soft tip, exits a catheter, it behaves
like a trocar until enough of it is outside the catheter to
fold on itself.
After this case, I stopped using ‘‘push’’ catheters
(e.g., RC-1, RIM) during renal angioplasty and stenting
procedures in favor short reverse curve or ‘‘pull’’ catheters
(VS-1 or SOS Omni catheter). These catheters form in

the abdominal aorta or aortic arch. Instead of using the
catheter to select the vessel of interest, a soft-tipped
guidewire such as a Bentson is advanced 1–2 cm out of
the catheter and the catheter is advanced cephalad until
the wire engages the vessel. The catheter is then pulled
caudal and the reverse curve enables the catheter
and wire to cross the lesion. The soft-tipped wire is
exchanged for a rigid wire such as a Rosen guidewire to
complete the procedure. I generally use hydrophilic wires
as a last resort because they may easily dissect plaques
rather than remaining in the true lumen of the vessel.
Like any complication, iatrogenic dissections are
best avoided whenever possible. When they occur, there
is no consensus on the best strategy. All patients should

be liberally heparinized to limit branch vessel thrombo￾sis. In some vessels such as the common iliac artery, if an
occlusive dissection occurs, I usually attempt to approach
the lesion from the opposite direction. This requires a
second puncture in the contralateral femoral artery or
sometimes the popliteal artery. This maneuver enables
approach to the problem from the unaffected distal
vessel and obviates the possibility of propagating the
dissection further distally.
Attempting to cross the dissection from an ante￾grade direction is a difficult proposition and can lead to
further propagation of the flap. On the other hand, if the
artery is occluded by the dissection, there may be no
other alternative, particularly if a vascular surgeon is not
immediately available for bypass. I use a hydrophilic wire
and gently probe the area of the flap. The single most
important aspect is probably luck. In my experience,
when successful, the wire usually crosses easily into
the distal vessel. It is important to realize that when
the true lumen of the vessel is reentered, the reentry
point may have occurred through the dissection flap and
a stent is frequently necessary to tack down the flap
completely.
An occlusive dissection may also occur after
angioplasty. This is rarely a problem unless the flap
spirals far distally (beyond the guidewire tip) because
the guidewire used for the procedure remains in the true
lumen of the vessel, facilitating repeated angioplasty or
stenting, or both. Dissections created ‘‘against the flow’’
of blood are rarely problematic because blood flow tends
to push the flap against the vessel instead of causing the
flap to open and function like a windsock.
