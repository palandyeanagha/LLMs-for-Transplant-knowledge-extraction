Abstract
Introduction Severe acute renal failure (sARF) is associated
with considerable morbidity, mortality and use of healthcare
resources; however, its precise epidemiology and long-term
outcomes have not been well described in a non-specified
population.
Methods Population-based surveillance was conducted among
all adult residents of the Calgary Health Region (population 1
million) admitted to multidisciplinary and cardiovascular surgical
intensive care units between May 1 1999 and April 30 2002.
Clinical records were reviewed and outcome at 1 year was
assessed.
Results sARF occurred in 240 patients (11.0 per 100,000
population/year). Rates were highest in males and older patients
(≥65 years of age). Risk factors for development of sARF
included previous heart disease, stroke, pulmonary disease,
diabetes mellitus, cancer, connective tissue disease, chronic
renal dysfunction, and alcoholism. The annual mortality rate was
7.3 per 100,000 population with rates highest in males and
those ≥65 years. The 28-day, 90-day, and 1-year case-fatality
rates were 51%, 60%, and 64%, respectively. Increased
Charlson co-morbidity index, presence of liver disease, higher
APACHE II score, septic shock, and need for continuous renal
replacement therapy were independently associated with death
at 1 year. Renal recovery occurred in 78% (68/87) of survivors
at 1 year.
Conclusion sARF is common and males, older patients, and
those with underlying medical conditions are at greatest risk.
Although the majority of patients with sARF will die, most
survivors will become independent from renal replacement
therapy within a year.

Introduction
Severe acute renal failure (sARF) in the critically ill patient is
associated with high rates of morbidity, mortality, and con￾sumption of healthcare resources [1-6]. Population-based
studies conducted in Australia and Europe have estimated the
annual incidence of sARF at 4.2 to 13.4 per 100,000 popula￾tion; however, these studies were not designed to assess risk
factors, long-term survival and renal recovery outcomes [5,7-
9]. Although several hospital-based cohort studies have sug￾gested that several factors, including increasing age, sepsis
syndrome, and cardiovascular or pulmonary organ failure,
increase the risk for developing sARF, these studies poten￾tially suffer from selection bias, and no study to date has been
adequately designed to determine actual risk factors in a non￾specific general population [2,10-13]. Population-based stud￾ies have identified in-hospital case-fatality rates for sARF rang￾ing between 45% and 70% [5,7-9]. Although renal recovery is
reported to occur in many patients surviving sARF, this rate is
not well described because of inadequate duration or consist￾ency of follow-up [3-12,14-21]. As a result, the long-term sur￾vival and renal recovery outcomes for sARF are currently
unknown.
An understanding of the epidemiology of sARF is important to
establish its overall burden and risk factors for development
and for surveillance or devising potential preventive strategies.
Furthermore, knowledge of the outcome of sARF is important
to aid clinicians, patients, and their families in decision-making
regarding patient management choices in the intensive care
unit (ICU). The objectives of this study were, therefore, to
define the incidence of and quantify the risk factors for devel￾oping sARF, and to establish the long-term outcome and its
determinants in a large well-defined population.
Materials and methods
Patient population
The Calgary Health Region (CHR) provides virtually all hospi￾tal care to the residents of the cities of Calgary and Airdrie and
approximately 20 nearby towns and villages (2001 adult pop￾ulation 728,207) [22]. Adult critically ill patients in the CHR
are managed in closed ICUs by dedicated intensivists under
the direction of the Department of Critical Care Medicine, Uni￾versity of Calgary and the CHR. The study population con￾sisted of all adult (≥18 years) residents of the CHR admitted
to any of the three multidisciplinary ICUs or the cardiovascular
surgery ICU from May 1 1999 to April 30 2002. The study pro￾tocol was approved by the Conjoint Health Research Ethics
Board at the University of Calgary and CHR prior to
commencement.
Study protocol
The study used a population-based surveillance cohort
design. The ICU Tracer database, a clinical research and
departmental support database that prospectively and rou￾tinely records data on all patients admitted to adult ICUs in the
CHR was used to identify patients with sARF among all admis￾sions to the study ICUs. The ICU Tracer database collected
detailed clinical and physiologic data for all sARF patients on
the dates of admission and initiation of renal replacement ther￾apy (RRT). A trained research nurse and physician reviewed
hospital medical records to obtain detailed clinical information
using standardized data forms for all patients identified with
sARF. Potential factors contributing to the development of
sARF were considered if identified within 10 days preceding
initiation of RRT.
Study definitions
sARF was defined as the new requirement for RRT with evi￾dence of renal dysfunction (serum creatinine ≥ 150 µmol/l) at
the time of or during ICU admission [8,9]. Those patients that
received RRT for any indication in the absence of renal dys￾function (i.e. toxin ingestion/overdose) or patients with end￾stage renal disease already receiving chronic RRT or patients
having their first RRT >48 h prior to ICU admission were
excluded. Renal replacement therapy in the ICU encompassed
continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and/or intermit￾tent hemodialysis (IHD). No patient received RRT in the form
of peritoneal dialysis while admitted to ICU. The decision for
initiation of RRT was made at the discretion of the attending
intensivist. A regional protocol has been implemented to guide
in the initial RRT prescription and method of anticoagulation
for CRRT as previously described [23]. IHD was prescribed in
consultation with the CHR clinical nephrology service.
Chronic renal dysfunction was defined as a pre-existing serum
creatinine ≥150 µmol/l for at least six months prior to ICU
admission. Oliguria was defined as the production of <500 ml
of urine in the 24 h preceding assessment. The definitions by
Liano et al. [7] and clinical sensibility were used for classifica￾tion of etiologies of sARF and characterization of indications
for RRT upon review of available patient medial record data
immediately preceding initiation of RRT. Pre-renal etiology was
defined as directed therapy (i.e. volume repletion and/or
increased cardiac output) being successful in improving and/
or correcting renal function. Intra-renal etiology of sARF was
defined when renal function failed to improve after correction
for possible pre-renal etiologies and exclusion of hepatorenal
syndrome and post-renal etiologies. Intra-renal etiology was
further classified into acute tubular necrosis, acute glomerulo￾nephritis, acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis or vascular etiology
based on the presence of predisposing factors, histological
evidence, serum or urinary markers and/or high clinical suspi￾cion [7]. A study physician (SMB) reviewed all abstracted data
forms prior to entry into the study database in order to ensure
consistency of application of study definitions and diagnoses.
Severity of illness at ICU admission was assessed using the
Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II
score [24]. The presence and evaluation of selected pre-exist￾ing co-morbidities was assessed using the Charlson Co-mor￾bidity Index [25]. Shock preceding or at the time of initiation of

Available online http://ccforum.com/content/9/6/R700

RRT was defined as mean arterial pressure <70 mmHg and
need for vasopressor therapy. The presence of sepsis, septic
shock, and acute respiratory distress syndrome preceding or
at the time of the initiation of RRT was defined according to
consensus guidelines [26,27].
Data sources
The size and demographic profile of the CHR adult population
at risk during 1999 to 2002 were obtained by using popula￾tion data from the Alberta Health Registry [22]. The prevalence
of selected underlying chronic illnesses was estimated based
on Canadian survey data [28,29], with the exception of the
prevalence of chronic kidney disease, which was determined
by United States survey data [30]. Long-term renal outcome
and RRT dependence status was determined from the South￾ern Alberta Renal Program database that maintains informa￾tion on all patients in southern Alberta on RRT [31]. The long￾term mortality outcome status was obtained through linkage of
the Death Registration Database maintained by Alberta Vital
Statistics and the Alberta Health and Wellness registry.
Alberta Health and Wellness maintains information on all resi￾dents of Alberta eligible for publicly funded healthcare cover￾age (>99% of the population is included in this registry). The
use of both information systems ensured completeness of the
linkage process. Data were exported from the source data￾bases and linked using Access 2003 (Microsoft Corporation,
Redmond, WA, USA).
Statistical analysis
Analysis was performed using Stata version 8.2 (Stata Corpo￾ration, College Station, TX, USA). To avoid assessment of mul￾tiple outcomes for a single patient, only the first ICU
presentation associated with sARF was analyzed for patients
with multiple ICU admissions. Normally or near normally dis￾tributed variables were reported as means with standard devi￾ations (SDs) and compared using Student's t-test. Non￾normally distributed continuous data were reported as medi￾ans with inter-quartile ranges (IQRs) and compared using the
Mann Whitney U test. Categorical data are compared using
Fisher's Exact Test. Population-based incidence rates were
calculated and reported as relative risks (RRs) with exact 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) [32]. A multivariable logistic regres￾sion model was developed to assess factors in patients with
sARF associated with mortality at 1 year. The initial model
included selected variables known to potentially confound
and/or modify the association of sARF and death at 1 year,
including age, sex, Charlson co-morbidity index, APACHE II
score, and admission type (medical versus surgical). The sec￾ond model added variables to the first model if found to be sig￾nificant at the p < 0.1 level in univariate analysis. Sequential
elimination of variables was performed by the likelihood ratio
method to develop the final parsimonious model. Appropriate
diagnostic tests to ensure no violation of mathematical
assumptions were performed. Model calibration and discrimi￾nation were assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow good￾ness-of-fit test (degrees of freedom (8)) and the area under the
receiver operator characteristic (AuROC) curve, respectively.
Results are reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CI. The
rate of renal recovery among patients surviving sARF was
determined at 1-year follow-up and expressed as a proportion.
Results
During the study period, 5,693 adult residents of the CHR had
6,762 admissions to a CHR ICU. Of these, 62% were male,
the median (IQR) age was 64.9 (50.6 to 74.5) years and mean
(±SD) APACHE II score was 24.9 ± 8.7 points at ICU admis￾sion. A total of 343 (6%) patients received RRT at least once
during an ICU admission, of which 103 (1.8%) were excluded:
92 (1.6%) for outpatient chronic RRT, 6 for RRT in an ICU
without critical illness and 5 received RRT for toxin removal in
the absence of renal disfunction. Therefore, 240 (4.2%)
patients were diagnosed with sARF for an overall annual inci￾dence of 11.0 per 100,000 population. The incidence of sARF
was stable over the three years of the study.
Population-based risk factors and mortality for severe 
acute renal failure
The annual incidence rate of sARF was higher in males com￾pared to females (13.0 versus 9.1 per 100,000 population;
RR 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1–1.9, p = 0.006). This relationship was
more pronounced for those ≥65 years old with higher risk in
males (70.0 versus 31.9 per 100,000 population; RR 2.2;
95% CI, 1.5–3.2, p < 0.0001) compared with no significant
difference in risk between sexes for those <65 years old (6.4
versus 5.5 per 100,000 population; RR 1.2; 95% CI, 0.8–1.7,
p = 0.44) (Figure 1).
Several groups were identified in the adult CHR general pop￾ulation as being at significantly higher risk for development of
sARF, with patients with heart disease, stroke, and chronic
lung disease at highest risk (Table 1).
The population-based annual mortality rate associated with
sARF was 7.3 deaths per 100,000 population. There was a
trend toward a higher annual mortality rate in males compared
with females (8.2 versus 6.3 per 100,000 population; RR 1.3;
95% CI, 0.9–1.8, p = 0.1); however, when further stratified by
age ≥65 years, the annual mortality rate was significantly
higher for males compared with females (47.5 versus 23.1 per
100,000 population; RR 2.1; 95% CI, 1.3–3.3, p < 0.001).
There was no significant difference in mortality risk between
sexes for age <65 years (3.6 versus 3.7 per 100,000 popula￾tion; RR 0.99; 95% CI, 0.6–1.6, p = 0.96) (Figure 2).
Clinical features and management
The majority (166/240, 69%) of diagnoses of sARF occurred
within two days of ICU admission. The median (IQR) time to
diagnosis of sARF was 4 (1 to 10.5) days after hospital admis￾sion and 1 (0 to 3) day after ICU admission. Among the 240
patients with sARF, 203 (85%) had intra-renal, 36 (15%) pre-

renal, and one had a post-renal etiology (0.4%) (Table 2). Of
the 203 patients with an intra-renal etiology, 180 (75%) had
acute tubular necrosis, and 33 (14%) had vascular, 12 (5%)
glomerular, and 9 (4%) interstitial etiologies. Toxic exposures
included parenteral radiocontrast media in 107 (45%),
aminoglycosides in 47 (20%) and amphotericin B in 10 (4%).
The indications for institution of RRT were diuretic-resistant
fluid overload in 178 (74%), metabolic acidosis in 87 (36%),
uremia in 68 (28%), hyperkalemia in 59 (25%), and toxins in 4
(2%).
The modality of renal replacement in the ICU was exclusively
CRRT in 147, exclusively IHD in 48, and some combination of
regimens using both CRRT and IHD in 45 patients. A total of
941 and 343 patient-days of CRRT and IHD were performed,
respectively. The median overall duration of RRT in the ICU
was 3 (IQR; 1 to 9) days.
The overall median (IQR) ICU and hospital length of stay was
8.1 (3.4 to 16) and 22 (9 to 40) days, respectively. Of those
who survived to hospital discharge, the median (IQR) ICU and
hospital length of stay was 8.4 (3.6 to 19) and 37 (22 to 62)
days, respectively.
Long-term outcomes of severe acute renal failure
Among the 240 patients with sARF, 50% (n = 120) died dur￾ing their ICU admission and 60% (n = 143) died prior to hos￾pital discharge. The 28-day, 90-day, and 1-year case-fatality
rates were 51% (n = 123), 60% (n = 143), and 64% (n =

153), respectively. Several categorical and continuous factors
were associated with death at 1-year in univariate analysis, as
shown in Tables 3 and 4. Factors not significantly associated
with death at 1 year included sex, oliguria, etiology of sARF, or
indication for RRT. A multivariable logistic regression model
was developed to assess for independent factors associated
with death at 1 year for patients with sARF and model varia￾bles are presented in Table 5. The model calibration and fit
was excellent with an AuROC curve of 0.83 and a Hosmer￾Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test (degrees of freedom (8)) result
of p = 0.78.
Of patients with sARF who survived, 38% (46/120) and 68%
(66/97) had recovered renal function to become RRT inde￾pendent at ICU and hospital discharge, respectively. The rates
of renal recovery in survivors at 28 and 90 days were 55%
(64/117) and 71% (69/97), respectively. Of the 87 patients
with sARF who survived to at least 1 year following admission
to ICU, 78% (68/87) became independent of RRT after a
median (IQR) duration of 11 (3 to 20) days while the remain￾der received chronic RRT. Of those requiring chronic RRT,
63% (12/19) had pre-existing chronic renal disfunction with a
median (IQR) pre-admission serum creatinine of 232 (170 to
323) µmol/l. Thus, at 1 year following the diagnosis of sARF,
only 28% (68/240) were alive and free of RRT. Compared to
those that remained on chronic RRT, patients that recovered
renal function were more likely to be male, non-diabetic, have
a lower Charlson co-morbidity score, with a diagnosis of acute
tubular necrosis and sepsis or septic shock.
Discussion
This study describes the incidence and long-term mortality
rates for critically ill patients with a diagnosis of sARF and the
prognosis for long-term renal recovery in a well-defined non￾specified population. The annual incidence of sARF in our
well-defined population of 11.0 per 100,000 population per
year is similar to previous studies from two other continents,
8.0 to 13.4 per 100,000 in Australia and 4.2 to 8.0 per
100,000 in Europe, respectively [5,7-9]. However, two of
these studies are potentially prone to selection bias due to fail￾ure in clearly defining the geographic boundaries and classifi￾cation of residency status of the study referral population for

which the incidence of sARF was determined [8,33,34], and
all these studies are limited as none were able to assess for
risk factors, long-term survival or long-term renal recovery
prognosis [8,9,33]. Recently, the multi-centre BEST study
reported an estimated prevalence for ARF of 5.7% defined by
the presence of oliguria and/or azotemia and 4.2% for sARF
from 54 ICUs in 23 countries [21]. While the BEST study is
the largest, most comprehensive completed to date and dem￾onstrates a similar occurrence of sARF and in-hospital mortal￾ity with our study, it remains prone to selection bias and
provided no long-term follow-up. Morgera et al. reported sur￾vival in a cohort of critically ill patients with sARF of 77% and
50% at 6 months and 5 years, respectively; however, this
study is potentially prone to selection and information bias due
to inclusion of patients receiving only CRRT and incomplete
ascertainment of long-term survival status for the entire cohort
[6]. This was unlikely to be a major source of bias in the
present study because in the CHR, all critical care services are
provided by ICUs included within this surveillance and the
CHR is geographically isolated as a single provider of health￾care. Although we could have potentially missed sARF cases
that developed in CHR residents while receiving medical
attention not available in the CHR (i.e. cardiac, lung or liver
transplantation) or while traveling abroad. Likewise, we could

have potentially excluded sARF patients with peak serum cre￾atinine <150 µmol/l, resulting in an under-estimation of the
incidence of sARF. However, these sources of error, if present,
are likely to be small and insignificant. Therefore, this study fur￾ther establishes the major burden of disease in terms of occur￾rence, long-term mortality and renal prognosis attributable to
sARF in a non-specified population.
Recent consensus recommendations for defining and catego￾rizing acute renal failure have been presented; however, they
have not yet been prospectively validated with long-term clini￾cal outcomes such as mortality or renal recovery at 1 year [35].
This was published after completion of our study; thus, we
used as our primary case-definition, acute renal failure severe
enough, in the opinion of the treating intensivist, to warrant the
initiation of RRT. This definition was selected because the ini￾tiation of RRT in critically ill patients has clinical relevance both
in terms of severity of illness and for utilization of resources.
Thus, a diagnosis of sARF and institution of RRT represents a
considerable escalation in patient management. Further, we
selected sARF due to simplicity in potentially generalizing our
results across similar multi-disciplinary critically ill populations.
One potential limitation of this case-definition is defining what
factors contribute to the decision by the attending intensivist
to initiate RRT, rather than specific indications for RRT. This
was not addressed in our study and has yet to be prospec￾tively studied. Another consideration is that, in general, there is
likely to be heterogeneity across ICUs regarding who pre￾scribes RRT (i.e. intensivist or nephrologist); however, in this
regional critical care system, the decision to initiate RRT was
made by the attending intensivist only.
A novel aspect of this study was that several selected under￾lying conditions were determined to be associated with an
increased risk for development of sARF. While previous inves￾tigators have suggested that several factors, most notably
increasing age, pre-existing renal insufficiency, co-morbid liver
or cardiac disease, cancer, sepsis, and greater severity of ill￾ness are potential risk factors for sARF, no previous studies
were designed to determine and quantify risk in a general pop￾ulation [2,10-13]. Although these estimates provide unbiased
univariate population-based risk factors for development of
sARF, one potential limitation is the complexity in interpretation
without adjustment for potential confounders or effect
modifiers. However, our study has shown that critically ill
patients who were older, male, and have underlying co-morbid
illnesses were at higher risk for developing sARF and may rep￾resent a future target population for surveillance, earlier inter￾vention or preventive strategies.
Most studies of sARF in the critically ill population have
focused on mortality and renal recovery at ICU and hospital
discharge, therefore viewing sARF as an acute and short-term
illness [3-5,8,9,11,18,21,36]. Assessment of outcomes at
these points may underestimate the burden of disease attrib￾utable to sARF. Our data indicate that critically ill patients with
sARF may remain ill with an increased risk for death for a
duration greater than the total ICU or hospital length of stay.
This has been similarly shown with sepsis and septic shock,
where patients exhibit an increased risk of death following
discharge from hospital [37-39]. Therefore, clearly defined
long-term outcomes as demonstrated in our study, such as
case-fatality at 1 year of 64% and rate of renal recovery in
survivors of 78%, provide a more informative description of the
morbidity and mortality attributable to sARF. Furthermore, the
assessment of long-term outcome is important given the high
cost associated with RRT in the ICU and continuing chronic
RRT [1,4,5]. Likewise, independence from RRT is associated
with improved overall quality of life and functional status [1].
Dependence on RRT at hospital discharge and at 90 days has
been estimated to occur in 5% to 33% and 16% of patients,
respectively [3-5,8,9,11,18,21,36,40]; however, this does not
necessarily translate into long-term RRT dependence.
Although the overall rate of dependence on RRT at hospital
discharge in our study was comparably higher than other pop￾ulation-based studies, only 8% overall or 22% of survivors at
1 year remained on chronic RRT, an assessment duration
more likely associated with permanent need for chronic RRT.

We identified five factors independently associated with death
at 1 year (Table 5). Although the presence of co-morbid liver
disease, higher admission APACHE II score, septic shock,
and use of CRRT have been previously suggested, these stud￾ies are potentially biased due to the aforementioned limitations
in assessment of mortality at ICU or hospital discharge
[2,3,10,12-14,16-18,21,41,42]. An important variable
included in this study not previously reported is the contribu￾tion of the Charlson co-morbidity index to the overall risk of
death [25]. Previous hospital-based studies have included
previous health status as an independent risk for death; how￾ever, this was generally assessed by use of the chronic health
points component of the APACHE II score or the McCabe
scale [10,16,41]
The need for CRRT was independently associated with death
in our study after controlling for the confounding effects of co￾morbid illness and disease severity. This is plausible consider￾ing that in our clinical practice CRRT is utilized in more unsta￾ble patients with great burden of illness, and a poorer
expected outcome. Although similarly reported by Chertow et
al. [3], this would appear to contradict several randomized
studies suggesting no difference in mortality outcome
between CRRT and IHD; however, these studies have meth￾odological concerns, including failure of randomization, inade￾quate power to assess clinically meaningful differences in
primary outcome and, importantly, did not assess the inde￾pendent effect of dialysis modality on long-term outcomes
such as mortality or renal recovery at 1 year [43-47].
In contrast to previous hospital-based studies and our pre￾analysis prediction, none of older age, presence of pre-existing
renal disease, need for mechanical ventilation or oliguria were
independently associated with death [2,3,10,12-
14,16,17,41,48].
The apparent lack of association of chronic renal insufficiency
with death at 1 year in our study would appear counterintuitive
considering the association of death and co-morbid illness.
However, the presence of pre-existing renal disease in these
patients likely afforded greater susceptibility to overt renal
injury prompting RRT. Although not associated with death,
sARF in patients with co-morbid renal disease may represent
a cohort less likely to recover renal function and subsequently
require chronic RRT as suggested by our study.
Conclusion
We describe the first population-based study of sARF that
documents the major burden of disease in terms of incidence,
long-term mortality and prognosis of renal recovery in critically
ill patients. Furthermore, our study identifies and quantifies the
risk factors for acquisition of sARF and may serve as a ration￾ale for surveillance or targeting preventive measures. Although
we report that the case-fatality during the acute phase of sARF
is very high, our data support that survivors of sARF have an
excellent prognosis for long-term renal recovery. We believe
this study represents an important contribution for physicians,
patients, and their families and has the potential to greatly
impact the care of critically ill patients by aiding in and provid￾ing well-informed overall management decisions.

• sARF is common in critically ill patients and males, older 
patients and those with pre-existing co-morbidities are 
at highest risk.
• A diagnosis of sARF is associated with high mortality 
and pre-existing co-morbidities, liver disease, higher 
APACHE II score upon ICU admission, septic shock 
and need for continuous renal replacement therapy are 
independently associated with long-term mortality.
• In those patients with severe acute renal failure who sur￾vive an episode of critical illness, the majority will 
recover renal function and become independent of renal 
replacement therapy by 1 year.
