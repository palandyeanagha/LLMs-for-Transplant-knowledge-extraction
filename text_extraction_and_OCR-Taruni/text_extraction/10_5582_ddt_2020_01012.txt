novel coronavirus, pneumonia, COVID-19, 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV-2
The virus SARS-CoV-2 (formerly designated 2019-
nCoV) emerged in December 2019 and then spread 
rapidly worldwide, particularly to China, Japan, and 
South Korea. As of February 21, 2020, a total of 
76,288 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) and 2,345 deaths have been reported in 
mainland China (1). Scientists are endeavoring to find 
drugs to treat this disease. Research thus far has revealed 
more than 30 agents including Western medicines, 
natural products, and traditional Chinese medicines that 
may have potential efficacy against COVID-19. Some 
of these agents have been quickly tested in clinical 
studies and demonstrated preliminary efficacy against 
COVID-19. Antivirals including interferon α (IFN-α), 
lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine phosphate, ribavirin, and 
arbidol have been included in the latest version of the 
Guidelines for the Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment 
of Novel Coronavirus-induced Pneumonia issued by 
the National Health Commission (NHC) of the People’s 
Republic of China for tentative treatment of COVID-19 
(Table 1) (2). 
The Guidelines have been revised 5 times since 
first being issued on January 15, 2020; the latest edition 
(the 6th edition) was issued on February 18, 2020. The 
fifth edition of the Guidelines recommends antivirals 
including IFN-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin for 
treatment of COVID-19 (3). Chloroquine phosphate and 
arbidol are included in the sixth edition of the Guidelines 
based on the preliminary outcomes of clinical studies (2). 
The specific method for administration of IFN-α is vapor 
inhalation at a dose of 5 million U (and 2 mL of sterile 
water for injection) for adults, 2 times/day. The dosage of 
lopinavir/ritonavir is 400 mg/100 mg for adults, 2 times/
day. Ribavirin should be administered via intravenous 
infusion at a dose of 500 mg for adults, 2 to 3 times/
day in combination with IFN-α or lopinavir/ritonavir. 
Chloroquine phosphate is orally administered at a dose 
of 500 mg (300 mg for chloroquine) for adults, 2 times/
day. Arbidol is orally administered at a dose of 200 mg 
for adults, 3 times/day. The duration of treatment is no 
more than 10 days. 
IFN-α is a broad-spectrum antiviral that is usually 
used to treat hepatitis, though it is reported to inhibit 
SARS-CoV reproduction in vitro (4). Lopinavir/ritonavir 
is a medication for the human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) used in combination with other medications to 
treat adults and children over 14 days of age who are 
infected with HIV-1 (5). Chu et al. found that lopinavir/
ritonavir has anti-SARS-CoV activity in vitro and in 
clinical studies (6). Ribavirin is a nucleoside analogue 
with a broad-spectrum of antiviral effects. A study 
compared 111 patients with severe acute respiratory 
syndrome (SARS) treated with ribavirin monotherapy 
and 41 patients with SARS treated with lopinavir/
ritonavir and ribavirin; patients treated with the combined 
therapy had a lower risk of acute respiratory distress 
syndrome (ARDS) and death (6). Chloroquine is a 
widely used antimalarial that was found to be a potential 
broad-spectrum antiviral in 2006 (7). Chloroquine 
was found to block SARS-CoV-2 infection at low￾micromolar concentration, with a half-maximal effective 
concentration (EC50) of 1.13 μM and a half-cytotoxic 
concentration (CC50) greater than 100 μM (8). Arbidol 
is an antiviral that can be used to treat influenza virus. 
A study has revealed that arbidol can effectively inhibit 
SARS-CoV-2 infection at a concentration of 10-30 µM 
The SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged in December 2019 and then spread rapidly worldwide, particularly 
to China, Japan, and South Korea. Scientists are endeavoring to find antivirals specific to the virus. 
Several drugs such as chloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, and favipiravir are currently undergoing 
clinical studies to test their efficacy and safety in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) in China; some promising results have been achieved thus far. This article summarizes 
agents with potential efficacy against SARS-CoV-2.

in vitro (9). 
Besides the drugs above that have been included 
in the Guidelines, favipiravir is a drug that warrants 
attention. Favipiravir was approved for treatment of 
novel influenza on February 15, 2020 in China. This 
drug is currently undergoing clinic trials in treating 
COVID-19. Favipiravir is a new type of RNA-dependent 
RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor. In addition to its 
anti-influenza virus activity, favipiravir is capable of 
blocking the replication of flavi-, alpha-, filo-, bunya-, 
arena-, noro-, and other RNA viruses (10). Favipiravir 
is converted into an active phosphoribosylated form 
(favipiravir-RTP) in cells and is recognized as a 
substrate by viral RNA polymerase, thus inhibiting RNA 
polymerase activity (11). Therefore, favipiravir may have 
potential antiviral action on SARS-CoV-2, which is a 
RNA virus. On February 14, a clinical trial on favipiravir 
for the treatment of COVID-19 initiated by the Clinical 
Medical Research Center of the National Infectious 
Diseases and the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen 
achieved promising results. The preliminary results from 
a total of 80 patients (including the experimental group 
and the control group) indicated that favipiravir had more 
potent antiviral action than that of lopinavir/ritonavir 
(12). No significant adverse reactions were noted in the 
favipiravir treatment group, and it had significantly fewer 
adverse effects than the lopinavir/ritonavir group (12). 
Remdesivir is another potential drug for treatment 
of COVID-19. Remdesivir is a nucleoside analogue 
and a broad-spectrum antiviral. Animal experiments 
(13) indicated that remdesivir can effectively reduce the 
viral load in lung tissue of mice infected with MERS￾CoV, improve lung function, and alleviate pathological 
damage to lung tissue. Wang et al. found that remdesivir 
potently blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection at low￾micromolar concentrations and has a high selectivity 
index (half-maximal effective concentration (EC50), 0.77 
μM; half-cytotoxic concentration (CC50) > 100 μM; SI 
> 129.87) (8). Holshue et al. reported that remdesivir 
yielded promising results in the treatment of a patient 
with COVID-19 in the United States (14). In order to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of the drug in patients 
with COVID-19, a randomized, placebo-controlled, 
double-blind, multicenter, phase III clinical trial was 
launched on February 5, 2020 in China (15,16). Patients 
in the experimental group received a initial dose of 200 
mg of remdesivir and a subsequent dose of 100 mg for 9 
consecutive days via intravenous infusion in addition to 
routine treatment. Patients in the control group received 
routine treatment and the same dose of a placebo. The 
trial is expected to conclude by the end of April 2020. 
Studies have also revealed some other drugs may 
have potential efficacy in treating COVID-19. One 
is darunavir, which is a second-generation of HIV-1 
protease inhibitor. On February 4, 2020, researchers in 
China announced that darunavir inhibited SARS-CoV-2 
infection in vitro (9). Cell experiments indicated that 
darunavir significantly inhibited viral replication at a 
concentration of 300 μM in vitro and that its inhibition 
efficiency was 280-fold that in the untreated group (9). 
Other potential drugs include type II transmembrane 
serine protease (TMSPSS2) inhibitors and BCR-ABL 
kinase inhibitor imatinib. Hoffmann et al. indicated that 
SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor, ACE2, 
and the cellular protease TMPRSS2 to enter target cells. 
A TMPRSS2 inhibitor would block entry and thus 
constitute a treatment option (17). Imatinib has anti￾coronal activity primarily because it inhibits the fusion of 
virions with the endosomal membrane (18). 
A joint research team of the Shanghai Institute of 
Materia Medica and Shanghai Tech University performed 
drug screening in silicon and an enzyme activity test, 
and they reported 30 agents with potential antiviral 
activity against SARS-CoV-2 on January 25, 2020 
(19). These agents are indinavir, saquinavir, lopinavir, 
carfilzomib, ritonavir, remdesivir, atazanavir, darunavir, 
tipranavir, fosamprenavir, enzaplatovir, presatovir, 
abacavir, bortezomib, elvitegravir, maribavir, raltegravir, 
montelukast, deoxyrhapontin, polydatin, chalcone, 
disulfiram, carmofur, shikonin, ebselen, tideglusib, PX￾12, TDZD-8, cyclosporin A, and cinanserin. The same 
study also found that Chinese herbal medicines such 
as Rhizoma Polygoni Cuspidati and Radix Sophorae 
Tonkinensis may contain active ingredients against 
SARS-COV-2 (19). 
As the epidemic spreads, scientists around the world 
are actively exploring drugs that would be potentially 
effective in combating COVID-19. Generally, there are

no finally verified antivirals specific to COVID-19 at 
present. The efficacy and safety of these candidate drugs 
in the treatment of COVID-19 need to be confirmed in 
further preclinical and clinical trials.
