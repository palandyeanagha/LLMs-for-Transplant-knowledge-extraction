ABSTRACT
Objective To review the literature on the use of inhaled
nitric oxide to treat acute lung injury/acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) and to summarise the
effects of nitric oxide, compared with placebo or usual
care without nitric oxide, in adults and children with ALI or
ARDS.
Design Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Data sources Medline, CINAHL, Embase, and CENTRAL (to
October 2006), proceedings from four conferences, and
additional information from authors of 10 trials.
Review methods Two reviewers independently selected
parallel group randomised controlled trials comparing
nitric oxide with control and extracted data related to
study methods, clinical and physiological outcomes, and
adverse events.
Main outcome measures Mortality, duration of
ventilation, oxygenation, pulmonary arterial pressure,
adverse events.
Results 12 trials randomly assigning 1237 patients met
inclusion criteria. Overall methodological quality was
good. Using random effects models, we found no
significant effect of nitric oxide on hospital mortality (risk
ratio 1.10, 95% confidence interval 0.94 to 1.30),
duration of ventilation, or ventilator-free days. On day one
of treatment, nitric oxide increased the ratio of partial
pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/
FiO2 ratio) (13%, 4% to 23%) and decreased the
oxygenation index (14%, 2% to 25%). Some evidence
suggested that improvements in oxygenation persisted
until day four. There was no effect on mean pulmonary
arterial pressure. Patients receiving nitric oxide had an
increased risk of developing renal dysfunction (1.50, 1.11
to 2.02).
Conclusions Nitric oxide is associated with limited
improvement in oxygenation in patients with ALI or ARDS
but confers no mortality benefit and may cause harm. We
do not recommend its routine use in these severely ill
patients.
INTRODUCTION
Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS), defined by acute hypoxaemia and
bilateral lung infiltrates on radiography without left
atrial hypertension,1 are characterised by inflamma￾tion of the alveolar-capillary membrane triggered by
various insults.2 Because the pathophysiology involves
mismatching of ventilation and perfusion and pulmon￾ary hypertension, the possibility of using inhaled nitric
oxide (NO) generated considerable interest.3 Nitric
oxide is a selective pulmonary vasodilator and has
anti-inflammatory properties.4 5 Based on limited data
on efficacy, clinicians rapidly adopted this therapy;
63% of European intensive care specialists surveyed
in 1997 reported using it, primarily for ALI or
ARDS.6 A more recent survey of specialists in Ontario,
Canada, found that a substantial proportion (39%)
reported using nitric oxide at least sometimes in
selected patients with ARDS.7
A systematic review and meta-analysis of nitric
oxide published in 20038 9 that included five rando￾mised controlled trialsw3-w7 found no effect on mortality
or ventilator-free days; one trial showed improved
oxygenation.w3 Because confidence intervals were
wide, the authors concluded that the effects of nitric
oxide on morbidity and mortality were uncertain. We
have incorporated data from new randomised con￾trolled trials to evaluate the effects of nitric oxide on
pulmonary physiology (oxygenation and pulmonary
arterial pressure) and important clinical outcomes

METHODS
Search strategy
We electronically searched Medline, CINAHL,
Embase, and CENTRAL (to October 2006), limiting
citations to randomised controlled trials. We also
searched proceedings of four conferences (1994-
2006), screened bibliographies of retrieved studies
and recent review articles,10-18 and contacted content
experts to identify additional trials. There were no lan￾guage restrictions. Further details of the search strategy
and other aspects of study methods are on bmj.com.
Study selection
Two reviewers independently screened studies for
inclusion, retrieved potentially relevant studies, and
decided on study eligibility. We selected parallel
group trials that enrolled adults or children (excluding
neonates), with ≥80% of patients or a separately
reported subgroup having ALI or ARDS (using

oxide with placebo or usual treatment (not
prevention) for ALI or ARDS and reported
mortality (at any time), duration of ventilation, ventila￾tor-free days, or pulmonary physiological parameters
on days one to four of treatment (PaO2 (partial pressure
of oxygen)/FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen); oxyge￾nation index, defined as 100 × mean airway pressure/
(PaO2/FiO2); mean pulmonary arterial pressure). We
included trials with cointerventions applied equally in
both groups. We assessed agreement between
reviewers for trial eligibility using Cohen’s κ.

Data abstraction and validity assessment
Two reviewers independently abstracted data and
methods from included trials. We resolved by consen￾sus any disagreements that remained after contacting
trial authors. From included studies we abstracted
method of randomisation and allocation concealment,
blinding of caregivers and outcomes assessors, and
number of withdrawals after randomisation and deter￾mined whether mechanical ventilation, weaning, and
sedation were standardised or applied equally in treat￾ment groups.
We attempted to contact authors of all included trials
to request additional data and clarify data and methods
if necessary.
Quantitative data synthesis
Our primary outcome was mortality in hospital (or, if
not available, mortality in the intensive care unit or at
28 or 30 days). We decided a priori to combine trials
with less than half of patients crossing over from con￾trol to nitric oxide arms in analyses of clinical out￾comes. Our analyses adhered to the intention to treat
principle. In studies with two or more nitric oxide
groups receiving different doses, we combined data
to determine an overall effect for the nitric oxide
group.
Secondary outcomes included duration of ventila￾tion, ventilator-free days to 28 or 30 days, and pulmon￾ary physiology. We decided post hoc to combine data
on renal dysfunction after obtaining outcomes for most
randomised patients, but we describe other adverse
events qualitatively.

We used random effects models20 implemented in
Review Manager 4.2.7 (Cochrane Collaboration,
Oxford) for all analyses and considered P≤0.05 (two
sided) as significant. We report binary outcomes as
risk ratios and continuous outcomes as weighted
mean differences (measure of absolute change) and
ratios of means (measure of relative change).21 Sum￾mary effect estimates are presented with 95% confi￾dence intervals.
We assessed homogeneity between studies for each
outcome using the Cochran Q statistic,22 with P≤0.10
indicating significant heterogeneity,23 and I 2 24 25 with
suggested thresholds for low (25%-49%), moderate
(50%-74%), and high (≥75%) values. We developed
several a priori hypotheses to explain significant het￾erogeneity (excluding duration of ventilation and ven￾tilator-free days), including dose and duration of nitric
oxide therapy and whether therapy was restricted to
patients whose oxygenation improved acutely (“nitric
oxide responders”) or to those with ARDS (the more
hypoxaemic subset of ALI).
RESULTS
Trial flow
Electronic database searches yielded 1262 citations.
After evaluating these citations, conference abstracts,
review articles, and bibliographies of included trials,
we included 12 parallel group randomised controlled
trialsw1-w12 (fig 1). The two reviewers completely agreed
(κ=1) on the selection of included studies. We obtained
additional information from 10 authors (new
clinicalw1 w2 w5 w7 w8 w11 or physiological dataw1 w2 w7 w11;
clarifications of dataw6 w9 or methodsw1-w3 w5-w11).
Study characteristics and methodological quality
Table 1 describes the included studies, two of which
were published as abstracts only.w2 w7 Data from one
trial were distributed in two abstracts,w8 w13 and data
from another trial were distributed in two
articles.w6 w14 Trials randomised 1237 patients (median
40; range 14-385) with ALI or ARDS. Two trials
enrolled only children,w1 w6 one trial included a few
children,w4 and the remaining trials enrolled only
adults. All patients met American-European Consen￾sus Conference1 oxygenation criteria for ARDS except
for one trial that included some patients with ALI.w12
Seven trials used a fixed dose of nitric oxide (median 10
ppm; range 5-10 ppm),w1 w2 w6 w8 w10-w12 and five used the
lowest dose to achieve an oxygenation
responsew4 w5 w7 w9 or randomised patients to different
doses.w3 One trial enrolled only patients whose oxyge￾nation improved after a nitric oxide challenge (“nitric
oxide responders”),w7 and one used a cointervention (a
recruitment manoeuvre) in both groups.w11 Trials con￾tinued nitric oxide until prespecified gas exchange end
pointsw1 w3 w5 w7-w10 w12 or for a fixed period of time after
which nitric oxide was tapered by using gas exchange
criteriaw4 w6 or managed at clinicians’ discretion.w2 One
trial did not report on criteria for stopping nitric
oxide.w11 The median duration of administration was
6.5 days (range 3.5-9.0 days; data available from five
trialsw5 w7-w9 w11). One trial randomised patients to nitric
oxide or control for 24 hours, after which all patients
received nitric oxide.w1 In five other trials, control
patients received nitric oxide as rescue therapy after
randomisation if they met prespecified criteria (<50%
of controls in three trialsw4 w7 w8 and ≥50% in two
trialsw2 w6). Not for profit agencies funded five
trials,w1 w4-w6 w10 industry funded two trials,w3 w12 both
sources funded or supported four trials,w2 w7-w9 and
one trial did not report this information.w11
The 12 trials had good scientific quality (table 2). Ten
concealed randomisation,w1-w3 w5-w8 w10-w12 and five
blinded clinicians.w2 w3 w6 w8 w12 Mechanical ventilation
was delivered according to protocol in three unblinded
trialsw5 w10 w11 and one blinded trialw2 and according to
guidelines in three blinded trials.w3 w6 w12 Six trials
described or standardised at least one other cointer￾vention, such as corticosteroids,w3 sedation,w5 prone
ventilation,w5 w9-w12 and ventilator weaning.w11 w12 All
trials had complete follow-up, analysed patients by
assigned group, and withdrew no one from clinical out￾comes analyses. One trial stopped early because of
slow enrolment (achieving 45% of the planned sample
sizew7), and another trial enrolled 75% of the planned
sample, for unclear reasons.w12

Data synthesis
Effect of nitric oxide on clinical outcomes
We combined nine trialsw3-w5 w7-w12 in the mortality ana￾lysis (three were placebo controlledw3 w8 w12; five used
“usual care” controlsw4 w5 w7 w9 w10; one used recruit￾ment manoeuvres in both armsw11). We combined
three trials that reported duration of ventilation
(including all patientsw10 w11 or only survivorsw7) and
five trials reporting ventilator-free days.w3 w5 w8 w11 w12
Meta-analyses (table 3) showed that nitric oxide did
not affect mortality (risk ratio 1.10; 95% confidence
interval 0.94 to 1.30; fig 2), duration of ventilation
(17% increase, −20% to 70%; 3.6 additional days,
−4.0 to 11.1 days), or ventilator-free days (6% decrease,
−16% to 6%; 0.6 fewer days, −1.8 to 0.7 days). There
was moderate to high heterogeneity between studies
for duration of ventilation only.
A funnel plot of standard error versus risk ratio for
mortality did not suggest publication bias (fig 3).
Effect of nitric oxide on physiological outcomes
On the first day of therapy, NO was associated with
small improvements in the PaO2/FiO2 ratio (nine
trials; 13% higher, 4% to 23%; 16 mm Hg higher,
4 mm Hg to 27 mm Hg; fig 4) and oxygenation index
(three trials; 14% lower, 2% to 25%; 3 cm H2O/mm Hg
lower, 0.5 cm H2O/mm Hg to 5 cm H2O/mm Hg;
fig 5). Some evidence suggested that improvements in
oxygenation in the nitric oxide group persisted beyond
day one. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio was higher on day two
and four (but not on day three, and only in the ratio of
means analysis on day two). The oxygenation index
remained lower on days two, three, and four (only in
the weighted mean difference analysis on day three),
but only onew3 (days two and four) or twow3 w6 (day
three) trials contributed data. Differences in mean pul￾monary arterial pressure were not significant on any
day.
There was no evidence of important statistical het￾erogeneity in the physiological outcomes.
Adverse effects
Table 4 gives details of adverse effects. All 12 trials
gave information about methaemoglobin concentra￾tions. Four nitric oxide patients (of 651 randomised)
and three control patients (of 586 randomised) devel￾oped >5% methaemoglobinaemia.w3 w7 w12 One trial
reported three patients developing raised nitrogen
dioxide concentrations; all had received 80 ppm nitric
oxide.w3 Nitric oxide increased the risk of renal dys￾function in one unblindedw7 and three blindedw3 w8 w12
trials that enrolled 72% of patients in all included trials
(risk ratio 1.50, 1.11 to 2.02; fig 6). Other adverse
events were variably reported, and we did not combine
these data.

DISCUSSION
The routine use of inhaled nitric oxide is not beneficial
for patients with acute lung injury (ALI) and acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Our meta-ana￾lysis included 12 trials that randomly assigned 1237
patients and investigated the effects of inhaled nitric
oxide in such patients. We found no benefit of nitric
oxide on survival and an increased risk of renal dys￾function. Oxygenation improved over the first 24
hours (13% relative increase in PaO2/FiO2 ratio; 14%
decrease in oxygenation index), with some data sug￾gesting improvements to 96 hours. Given the limited
physiological improvements and possible harm, we
cannot recommend routine use of nitric oxide in
these patients.
The trend towards increased mortality in patients
receiving nitric oxide was highly consistent across
trials, with no trial dominating the meta-analysis.
Given the strength and magnitude of this trend, consis￾tency across trials, biological plausibility,18 w10 and the
finding of other potential adverse effects of nitric oxide
(for example, renal failure), our analysis raises con￾cerns about its nitric oxide in this setting.
Adverse events
Descriptive analyses suggest that methemoglobinae￾mia and raised nitrogen dioxide concentration are
not common or clinically important consequences,
except possibly in patients receiving high doses (at
least 80 ppm) of nitric oxide for several days. Data
from four large trials representing nearly three quarters
of all randomised patients showed an increased risk of
renal dysfunction in patients receiving nitric oxide.
Cautious interpretation is warranted, however, as this
result was a post hoc analysis and is potentially subject
to publication bias (we were unable to obtain explicit
data on renal outcomes in eight of 12 smaller trials, in
which this relation may not have been measured or
observed). In addition, the potential physiological
mechanisms linking administration of inhaled nitric
oxide to acute renal dysfunction—inhibition of mito￾chondrial and enzymatic function and damage to
deoxyribonucleic acid and membranes—are contro￾versial because of its simultaneous protective effects
on renal blood flow and leukocyte adhesion.26
Why nitric oxide may not be beneficial
There are several possible explanations for the lack of
benefit of routine administration of nitric oxide in
patients with ALI/ARDS. Firstly, short term physio￾logical improvements in oxygenation seem to have
no impact on patients’ survival,27 possibly because
oxygenation is not necessarily related to severity of
lung injury. Secondly, as most patients with ARDS
die of multiple organ failure rather than refractory
hypoxaemia,28 small changes in oxygenation might
not lead to improvements in outcome. Thirdly, the
prolonged fixed dosing regimen in most trials may
have attenuated benefit over time because of increased
sensitisation, dampening the oxygenation benefit
while continuing to expose patients to toxic effects
such as oxidative damage.18 w10 Fourthly, the benefits
of nitric oxide may have been overwhelmed by a
harmful mechanical ventilation strategy, which perpe￾tuated multiple organ failure.29 This, however, would
not account for our finding of potential harm. Finally,
trials restricting enrolment to patients with an acute
oxygenation response to nitric oxide may have found
a positive effect on mortality, although this hypothesis
was not supported in one trial.w7
Strengths and limitations
We used several methods to reduce bias (comprehen￾sive literature search, duplicate data abstraction, pre￾specified criteria for methodological assessment and
analysis) and analysed a comprehensive set of clinical
and physiological outcomes.We were unable to obtain
anyw4 w12 or completew3 additional information from
three trials. Considering secondary clinical outcomes,
we expected to find variation between trials in duration
of ventilation and ventilator-free days related to differ￾ent populations of patients. We analysed these out￾comes, while acknowledging the limited
interpretability of this analysis. Finally, given the
small number of trials contributing to analyses of

many physiological outcomes, the tests for heterogene￾ity were underpowered.
Although our results do not exclude the possibility
that some subgroups of patients may benefit from nitric
oxide, the consistent lack of a mortality benefit across
trials mitigates this possibility. The included trials did
not specifically study the issue of nitric oxide as rescue
therapy for patients with critically low oxygenation.
With nitric oxide, short term improved oxygenation
in these patients may create a window for other strate￾gies to improve lung function, such as treatment of the
underlying cause of ARDS.
Previous research
A previous systematic review and meta-analysis of
inhaled nitric oxide for acute hypoxaemic respiratory
failure8 9 included fewer randomised controlled
trialsw3-w7 and found no effect on mortality (risk ratio
0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 1.44; two trials,
204 patients). Our report is consistent with this work
and extends it by including more trials, thus narrowing
the confidence limits around the estimate of mortality.
We also provide new estimates of the impact of nitric
oxide on other clinical and physiological end points
and raise the possibility of harm induced by nitric
oxide.
In conclusion, our systematic review and meta-ana￾lysis found that inhaled nitric oxide improved oxyge￾nation in patients with ALI and ARDS at 24 hours of

therapy, with some evidence for a more prolonged
effect. Given that the best available evidence suggests
no survival advantage and possible increased mortality
and renal dysfunction with nitric oxide, we do not
recommend its routine use. Despite a lack of evidence
for benefit, some clinicians may still consider nitric
oxide for life threatening hypoxaemia, in conjunction
with other supportive therapies. Given the challenges
of enrolling such severely ill patients into large trials,
definitive data supporting or refuting a role for nitric
oxide in such desperate situations may not be forth￾coming, leaving clinicians to rely on their judgment
and the current evidence.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC
Inhaled nitric oxide continues to be used to improve oxygenation in patients with acute lung
injury, despite no clear supporting evidence
A previous meta-analysis in 2003 included five randomised trials of nitric oxide; there are
now 12 trials
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
Nitric oxide improves oxygenation temporarily but does not improve survival and may cause
harm
We do not recommend routine use of nitric oxide in patients with acute lung injury
