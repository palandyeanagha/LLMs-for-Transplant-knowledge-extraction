Abstract
Biliary atresia (BA) is a rare disease characterised by a biliary obstruction of unknown origin that
presents in the neonatal period. It is the most frequent surgical cause of cholestatic jaundice in this
age group. BA occurs in approximately 1/18,000 live births in Western Europe. In the world, the
reported incidence varies from 5/100,000 to 32/100,000 live births, and is highest in Asia and the
Pacific region. Females are affected slightly more often than males. The common histopathological
picture is one of inflammatory damage to the intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts with sclerosis and
narrowing or even obliteration of the biliary tree. Untreated, this condition leads to cirrhosis and
death within the first years of life. BA is not known to be a hereditary condition. No primary
medical treatment is relevant for the management of BA. Once BA suspected, surgical intervention
(Kasai portoenterostomy) should be performed as soon as possible as operations performed early
in life is more likely to be successful. Liver transplantation may be needed later if the Kasai
operation fails to restore the biliary flow or if cirrhotic complications occur. At present,
approximately 90% of BA patients survive and the majority have normal quality of life.
Disease name
Biliary atresia
Definition
Biliary atresia (BA) is a rare disease characterised by a bil￾iary obstruction of unknown origin that presents in the
neonatal period [1].
Background
BA is the most frequent surgical cause of cholestatic jaun￾dice in neonates. The common histopathological picture
is one of inflammatory damage to the intra- and extrahe￾patic bile ducts with sclerosis and narrowing or even oblit￾eration of the biliary tree [2]. Untreated, this condition
leads to cirrhosis and death within the first years of life.
Surgical treatment usually involves an initial attempt to
restore bile flow: the Kasai portoenterostomy [3], which is
performed as soon after diagnosis as possible. Later, liver
transplantation may be needed if the Kasai operation fails
to restore the biliary flow or if cirrhosis complications
occur [4]. BA remains the most common indication for
paediatric liver transplantation worldwide.
Epidemiology
The reported incidence of BA varies from 5/100,000 live
births in The Netherlands [5], 5.1/100,000 in France [6],
6/100,000 in the British Isles [7], 6.5/100,000 in Texas
[8], 7/100,000 in Victoria Australia [9], 7.4/100,000 in
Atlanta USA [10] and in Japan [11], 10.6/100,000 in
Hawaii [12], to 32/100,000 in French Polynesia [13]. Inci￾dence of BA is highest in Asia and the Pacific region.
Females are affected slightly more often than males.
Although some studies of time- and space-time distribu￾tion of BA cases have suggested seasonal variation and

clustering of cases [8-10], these results have not been con￾firmed by larger studies [5,6], [14,15].
Anatomical forms
Two different forms of BA have been identified [16]:
• Syndromic BA (~10%), associated with various congen￾ital anomalies such as polysplenia, asplenia, cardiac or
intra abdominal defects (situs inversus, pre-duodenal por￾tal vein, absence of retro-hepatic inferior vena cava, intes￾tinal malrotation).
• Non-syndromic BA (~90%), in which BA is an isolated
anomaly.
Several surgical classifications of BA have been proposed.
The French classification is based on the anatomical pat￾tern of the extrahepatic biliary tract remnant (Table 1)
[17,18].
Aetiology
The aetiology of BA remains unknown. Some cases seem
to be related to abnormal morphogenesis of bile ducts
occurring early in gestation, while others appear to arise
from later damage to normally developing bile ducts.
There are several strands of evidence to suggest that even
in non-syndromic BA, the onset takes place early in gesta￾tion. Antenatal ultrasonography allows detection of those
forms of BA that show cystic changes [19]. In a series of 10
infants detected antenatally, most were non-syndromic
and the first abnormal scans were observed at about 20
weeks of gestation [20]. In one study on serial digestive
enzyme sampling in amniotic fluid, gamma-glutamyl
transpeptidase (gamma-GTs) levels were found signifi￾cantly low as early as 18 weeks of gestation in infants born
with non-syndromic BA, providing strong evidence of bil￾iary obstruction at this term of gestation [21].
Human embryo studies have also revealed similarities
between the appearance of developing bile ducts during
the first trimester of pregnancy and the residual ductules
seen at porta hepatis level in BA patients; thus, it was sug￾gested that some cases of BA may result from alteration of
the remodelling process of the bile ducts originating from
the ductal plate membrane [22]. The persistence of prim￾itive foetal-type bile ducts that leak bile into surrounding
tissues and induce a secondary inflammatory reaction in
utero has also been suggested. Recent studies have focused
on normal and altered bile duct morphogenesis [23,24]
and the initiation of hepatic fibrosis [25].
The role of viruses has been extensively studied. An asso￾ciation of BA with cytomegalovirus [26,27], respiratory
syncitial virus [28], Epstein-Barr virus [29] and human
papilloma virus [30] has been reported. In contrast, no
association with hepatitis A, B and C viruses has been
found [31,32]. Reovirus type 3 can cause cholangitis
resembling BA in mice [33] and may be associated with
spontaneous BA in the rhesus monkey [34]. In human
neonates, the association of reovirus type 3 and BA has
been suggested in several studies [35-38] but not sup￾ported in others [39-41]. Rotavirus type A can cause bil￾iary obstruction in newborn mice, mimicking BA [42];
deleterious effects of rotavirus infection in mice can be
prevented by interferon alpha [43]. In humans, the role of
rotavirus type C in the aetiology of BA remains controver￾sial [44,45].
Several observations suggest that a genetic component
plays a role in the pathogenesis of BA, although this is
probably only one of multiple factors. Familial cases of BA
have been reported [46-50] although discordant sets of
monozygotic twins have also been observed [51-53]. Var￾iations in the incidence of BA among different races have
been reported from Hawaii [12] and Atlanta, USA [10].
The incidence of HLA B12 and haplotypes A9-B5 and
A28-B35 was found to be higher in infants with BA com￾pared to a control group in one UK study [54].
Clinical features
After birth, the clinical triad of BA is:
• Jaundice (conjugated hyperbilirubinemia lasting
beyond two weeks of life)
• Acholic (white) stools and dark urine (Figure 1)

• Hepatomegaly
The general condition of the child is usually good. There
is no failure to thrive, at least in the first months. Thereaf￾ter, weight loss and irritability develop, accompanied by
increasing levels of jaundice. Later signs include splenom￾egaly (suggesting portal hypertension), ascites and haem￾orrhage (which can be intracranial, gastrointestinal or
from the umbilical stump) due to impaired absorption of
vitamin K. Untreated, this condition leads to cirrhosis and
death within the first years of life.
Diagnosis and diagnostic methods
Since early diagnosis appears essential for effective surgi￾cal treatment [17,18], [55-57], every case of neonatal
jaundice lasting more than two weeks should be investi￾gated and biliary atresia actively excluded [58,59]. Diag￾nosis is made on the basis of the clinical manifestations
and is supported by the following diagnostic methods:
• Ultrasonography
Ultrasonography of the liver is performed after 12 hours
of fasting (with an IV dextrose infusion). BA is suspected
when the gallbladder is shrunk despite fasting, when the
liver hilum appears hyperechogenic ("triangular cord
sign") or when there is a cyst at the liver hilum. There
should be no evidence of bile duct dilatation. Syndromic
BA infants may show other features such as multiple
spleens, preduodenal portal vein, absence of retrohepatic
vena cava or abdominal situs inversus.
• Cholangiography
When the gallbladder seems normal on ultrasonography
scans, cholangiography is needed to assess the morphol￾ogy and patency of the biliary tree. A cholangiogram can
be obtained percutaneously (puncture of the gallbladder),
endoscopically (ERCP) or at operation.
• Liver biopsy
The main histological features suggestive of BA are bile
plugs, ductular proliferation, portal oedema and/or fibro￾sis. As with any other cause of neonatal cholestasis, giant
cell transformation may be observed.
• Others
Biochemical liver function tests show cholestasis (with
elevated cholesterol and gamma-GTs). Hepatobiliary
scintigraphy (e.g. HIDA scans) demonstrates a failure of
excretion of the radioisotope into the intestine, but this
feature can also be observed in any severe neonatal
cholestasis [60].
Differential diagnosis
Medical causes of neonatal cholestasis must be excluded.
The main differential diagnose are: Alagille syndrome,
sclerosing cholangitis with neonatal onset, alpha-1-antit￾rypsin deficiency, cystic fibrosis, and more rarely progres￾sive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC).
In most cases, diagnosis of BA can be strongly suspected
after consideration of the clinical features, ultrasonogra￾phy scans and exclusion of the main medical causes of
neonatal cholestasis. Cholangiography and/or liver
biopsy are indicated only in cases where the diagnosis
remains uncertain, especially when the gallbladder seems
normal on ultrasonography scans [61,62].
Antenatal diagnosis
Antenatal diagnosis of BA remains exceptional. BA Types
1 and 2, which are rare, can be suspected on antenatal
ultrasonography scans when a cystic structure is detected
in the liver hilum [19,63]. Postnatal examination has to
distinguish the cystic form of BA, which requires urgent
surgery, from a choledocal cyst for which surgery may be
delayed.
Non-visualization of the foetal gallbladder in early preg￾nancy (14–16 weeks gestation) may be associated with
severe foetal anomalies, including polymalformation syn￾dromes, chromosomal aberrations, cystic fibrosis [64]:
amniocentesis is recommended for cystic fibrosis screen￾ing, hepatic enzymes tests and chromosomal analysis.
Gallbladder may be visualised later in pregnancy, suggest￾ing a delay in its recanalisation process. When the gall￾bladder remains undetectable after birth, the possibility
that the patient has BA has to be carefully investigated.

The incidence of agenesis of the gallbladder (without BA)
is estimated at approximately 1/6000 pregnancies [64].
Features of polysplenia syndrome may be detected by
antenatal ultrasonography. They may be part of a cardios￾plenic syndrome whose prognosis depends mainly on the
underlying cardiopathy [65,66]. Interrupted inferior vena
cava may be isolated and benign [67]. However, neonates
with features of the polysplenia syndrome should be care￾fully followed in order to rule out BA.
Management
The current management of BA patients involves two
steps:
• Kasai operation (in the neonatal period), which aims to
restore bile flow.
• Liver transplantation in children for whom the Kasai
operation has failed in its primary aim or for whom com￾plications of biliary cirrhosis have supervened.
• The Kasai operation: hepatoporto-enterostomy
After transverse supra-umbilical incision and laparotomy,
diagnosis is confirmed by inspection of the liver and bil￾iary tract. In most cases (type 4: complete extrahepatic
BA), diagnosis is obvious with a cholestatic or fibrotic
liver and a shrunken fibrotic gallbladder (Figure 2). If the
gallbladder is still patent or if there is a cyst at the liver
hilum, the colour of their content is noted and cholangi￾ography is performed. Features of polysplenia syndrome,
as well as any other intra-abdominal anomaly, are noted.
The portal pressure can be measured through a small cath￾eter introduced via the umbilical vein. After section of the
falciform, left and right triangular ligaments, the liver is
exteriorised out of the abdominal cavity. The entire extra￾hepatic biliary tree is excised together with the fibrous tis￾sue occupying the space between the left and right
branches of the portal vein at the level of the porta hepa￾tis. A 45 cm Roux-en-Y loop is prepared and passed
through the mesocolon to the liver hilum. An anastomo￾sis is fashioned between the cut edge of the transsected tis￾sue in the porta hepatis and the antimesenteric side of the
Roux loop (Figure 3). A liver biopsy is performed.
Many technical variants are possible, according to the ana￾tomical pattern of the biliary remnant:
• Type 1 BA: cholecysto-enterostomy, or hepatico-enteros￾tomy.
• Type 2 BA: cysto-enterostomy. This operation can be
performed only if the hilar cyst communicates with the
dystrophic intrahepatic bile ducts (as shown at cholangi￾ography).
• Type 3 BA: hepatoporto-cholecystostomy. The patent
galbladder, cystic duct and common bile duct are pre￾served. The gallbladder is mobilised with preservation of
its pedicle. An anastomosis is performed between the gall￾bladder and the transsected tissue in the porta hepatis
(Figure 4). Since there is no direct contact between the
porta hepatis and the intestine, this operation reduces the
risk of post-operative cholangitis [57]. Its specific compli￾cations, however, are bile leaks and post-operative biliary

ascites caused by kinking and obstruction of the cystic
duct and the common bile duct [69-71].
• Post-operative course
Post-operatively, different drugs have been proposed
either for reducing the inflammatory process at the liver
hilum, which might lead to granulation and fibrous scar
obstructing the biliary ductules, or for increasing the bil￾iary flow. Although recommended by several surgeons
[72-74], the use of corticosteroids remains controversial
since their long-term benefit has not been proven; in addi￾tion there is a theoretical risk of exacerbating cholangitis.
During the evaluation phase of biliary atresia, the infant's
diet typically is not changed; post-operative breastfeeding
is encouraged when possible, but an energetic supplemen￾tation may be required to obtain a 150 to 180 Kcal/kg/day
intake. As long as cholestasis persists, supplementation in
fat-soluble vitamins (ADEK) is needed.
Outcome after successful Kasai operation
If the Kasai operation succeeds in restoring bile flow, the
stools become coloured and jaundice fades. This process
may last several weeks or months. The evolution of the
biliary cirrhosis is prevented or at least delayed; survival
with the native liver has been reported up to adulthood
(Figure 5) [75,76].
The most common complications following the Kasai
procedure include:
• Cholangitis
Direct communication of the intestine with the dys￾trophic intrahepatic bile ducts, together with poor bile
flow, can cause an ascending bacterial cholangitis. This
occurs particularly in the first weeks or months after the
Kasai procedure in 30%-60% of cases [77,78]. This infec￾tion may be severe and sometimes fulminant. There are
signs of sepsis (fever or hypothermia, impaired haemody￾namic status), recurrent jaundice, acholic stools and per￾haps abdominal pain. Diagnosis can be confirmed by
analysis of blood cultures and/or liver biopsies [78].
Treatment requires IV antibiotics and effective IV resusci￾tation. In the cases with recurrent and/or late cholangitis,
obstruction of the Roux en Y loop or persisting colonisa￾tion of intrabiliary cyst should be considered. Recurrent
cholangitis without a "surgical" cause may require contin￾uous antibiotic prophylaxis.
• Portal hypertension
Portal hypertension occurs in at least two-thirds of the
children after porto-enterostomy [79,80], even in those
with complete restoration of bile flow. The most common
sites of varices include the oesophagus, stomach, Roux
loop and anorectum. If the Kasai operation has clearly

failed and the patient displays poor biochemical liver
function and persisting jaundice, then liver transplanta￾tion is indicated. However, variceal sclerotherapy or band
ligation before liver replacement may be necessary. In
those cases with good liver function and absence of jaun￾dice, endoscopic therapy may be the only treatment nec￾essary [81,82]. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic
shunts (TIPS) are rarely used for this indication due to the
young age of the patients, the frequently observed hypo￾plasia of the portal vein and the possible development of
intrahepatic biliary cavities [83]. Surgical portosystemic
shunts are nowadays rarely indicated, especially when
transplantation is available, but should be considered
when there is a normal liver function, non-progressive
liver disease and life-threatening varices [84]. Severe
hypersplenism may exceptionally require splenic artery
embolisation [85].
• Hepatopulmonary syndrome and pulmonary 
hypertension
Similarly to patients with other causes of spontaneous
(cirrhosis or prehepatic portal hypertension) or acquired
(surgical) portosystemic shunts, pulmonary arteriov￾enous shunts may occur even after complete clearance of
jaundice (hepatopulmonary syndrome). Gut-derived
vasoactive substances that are not cleared by the liver (due
to the portosystemic shunts) may be responsible for this
complication. Typically, hepatopulmonary syndrome
causes hypoxia, cyanosis, dyspnoea and digital clubbing.
Diagnosis is confirmed by pulmonary scintigraphy. Pul￾monary hypertension can occur in cirrhotic children and
may provoke syncope or even sudden death. Diagnosis of
pulmonary hypertension is suggested by echocardiogra￾phy. Liver transplantation reverses pulmonary shunts [86]
and can reverse pulmonary hypertension (especially when
diagnosed at an early stage) [87].
• Intrahepatic biliary cavities
Large intrahepatic biliary cysts may develop several
months to years after the Kasai operation, even in patients
with complete clearance of jaundice. These cavities may
become infected and/or may compress the portal vein,
requiring external drainage. Cystoenterostomy [88] or
liver transplantation may eventually be required.
• Malignancies
Hepatocarcinomas, hepatoblastomas [89] and cholangi￾ocarcinomas [90] have been described in the cirrhotic liv￾ers of patients with BA, in childhood or adulthood.
Screening for malignancy has to be performed regularly in
the follow-up of patients who underwent a successful
Kasai operation.
Outcome after unsuccessful Kasai operation
If the Kasai operation fails to restore the bile flow, biliary
cirrhosis progresses and necessitates liver transplantation.
This is usually performed in the second year of life but
may be necessary earlier (from 6 months of life) when
there is a rapid aggravation of the liver disease. BA repre￾sents more than half of the indications for liver transplan￾tation in childhood. Transplantation may also be required
in those cases where recurrence of jaundice (secondary
failure of the Kasai operation) or complications of cirrho￾sis (e.g. hepatopulmonary syndrome) occur despite an
initially successful outcome after the Kasai operation.
There are two sources of liver grafts:
• Cadaveric donor: the graft is rarely a full size liver taken
from a size-matched paediatric donor. More commonly,
the graft consists of a left lobe (segments 2+3) or a left
liver (2+3+4) obtained after reduction or splitting of an
adult liver graft.
• Living-related donor: usually from one of the parents of
the child.
Currently, patient survival at 5 and 10 years after liver
transplantation is more than 80% [91-94]. In most cases,
the quality of life of the transplanted patient is close to
normal. Normal somatic growth pattern and physical,
sexual and intellectual maturity are usually achieved [95-
97].
Overall outcome of BA patients
The overall prognosis of BA patients has improved since
the early days of paediatric liver transplantation. Nowa￾days about 90% of BA patients may hope to survive (Table
2), with a normal quality of life for most of them.

Several prognostic factors have been identified in BA
patients. Some of them are related to characteristics of the
disease (and cannot be altered): the prognosis of the Kasai
operation is worse when BA is associated with a polysple￾nia syndrome [17,18,99]; when macroscopic obstructive
lesions of extra-hepatic biliary remnant are diffuse (prog￾nosis worsens from type 1 to type 4) [17,55-57]; when his￾tological obliteration of the bile ducts (especially at porta
hepatis) is more severe [100,101]; and when liver fibrosis
is more extensive at time of the Kasai operation (102–
107). Other prognostic factors are related to the manage￾ment of BA patients and can be improved:
• the chances of success of the Kasai operation decrease
when the age at Kasai operation increases [17,55,57,59].
It is, therefore, very important to diagnose BA early.
• accessibility to liver transplantation [108]: the mortality
while waiting for a liver graft has recently decreased due to
the development of surgical techniques that increase the
availability of liver grafts: liver graft splitting [109], living
related liver donation [110].
• experience of the centre managing BA patients
[7,17,111]. This point led the British health authorities to
centralise all BA patients from England and Wales in three
paediatric liver units [98]. In France, a collaborative policy
between centres was promoted and a national observatory
of BA was created, in order to standardize therapeutic
results nationwide and evaluate the results of this decen￾tralized management.
Conclusion
With the sequential treatment including the Kasai opera￾tion in the first weeks of life and, in case of failure of this
procedure, secondary liver transplantation, 90% of
patients with BA can nowadays survive, with a normal
quality of life for most of them. Early diagnosis and treat￾ment by an experienced team provides children with the
best chance of survival.
