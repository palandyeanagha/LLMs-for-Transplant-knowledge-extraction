Bronchiolitis obliterans
syndrome leads to a
functional deterioration of the
acinus post lung transplant
ABSTRACT
Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) limits
long-term survival of lung transplant
recipients, and airflow obstruction in these
patients likely originates in the small airways.
61 double lung transplant recipients
performed multiple breath nitrogen washouts
to obtain indices of acinar and conductive
ventilation heterogeneity (Sacin, Scond). There
was a significant association of BOS status
with Sacin (Kruskal–Wallis; p<0.001) but not
with Scond (p=0.1). These results demonstrate
that it is the structural alteration of the
terminal bronchioles, generating ventilation
heterogeneity at the level of the diffusion
front, and not the bronchioles located more
proximally, that is driving the airflow
obstruction that determines BOS status.
Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS)
in a lung transplant recipient is a form of
chronic lung allograft rejection, currently
defined by a decline in forced expiratory
volume in 1 second (FEV1) of more than
20% in the presence of airflow obstruc￾tion (FEV1/FVC<70%).1 Despite histo￾logical evidence of peripheral airways
involvement in BOS, physiological mea￾surements of BOS are relatively sparse,
with tests of ventilation distribution
showing promise for early detection.2 As
spirometry is relatively insensitive and cer￾tainly non-specific to changes within the
small airways, pathological changes asso￾ciated with BOS can be better linked to
anatomical structures by a dedicated test
of ventilation heterogeneity.3 The aim of
this study was to determine the effect of
BOS stage on ventilation heterogeneity at
the level of the terminal bronchioles
versus that generated more proximally.
METHODS
Subject recruitment
Sixty-one bilateral lung transplant recipi￾ents (40 male and 21 female) with varying
degrees of BOS were recruited for the
study.
Multiple breath nitrogen washout
(MBNW)
MBNW provides indices that can separate
gas mixing in the airways at the level of the
diffusion front (Sacin)—likely to be located
around the acinar entrance—and that gen￾erated more proximally (Scond)
3
; an increase
in either Sacin or Scond reflects an increased
degree of ventilation heterogeneity, that is,
a deterioration in lung function.
RESULTS
Individual values of Sacin and Scond against
BOS stage can be appreciated from figure 1.
All subjects with a BOS stage ≥1 showed a
significantly greater Sacin versus BOS=0
subjects, and BOS=3 patients showed sig￾nificantly greater Sacin than BOS=1 or
BOS=2 patients (figure 1A). There was no
significant dependence of Scond on BOS
status (figure 1B). There was a strong cor￾relation of FEV1/FVC with Sacin
(Spearman rho=−0.72; p<0.001) but not
with Scond (p=0.097).
DISCUSSION
We have identified a functional correlate of
airway obstruction in patients who fit the
strict definition of BOS1 by observing
increased acinar ventilation heterogeneity
(Sacin) with BOS stage. Based on mathemat￾ical modelling, Sacin is assumed to be gen￾erated around the terminal bronchioles,3
hence our functional findings are in
agreement with recent observations from
micro CT on explanted lungs obtained
from six patients with BOS undergoing
retransplantation.4 In this preliminary
study published in abstract form,4 obliter￾ating lesions are reported in the airways
immediately proximal to the terminal
bronchioles, that is, preterminal bronch￾ioles, of patients with BOS. Beyond these,
a normal airway structure leading into the
alveolated zone was observed. One could
speculate that excessive narrowing of pre￾terminal bronchioles airways shifts the dif￾fusion front, which is the basis of Sacin
measurement. Coincidently, recent math￾ematical modelling work published in
abstract form by Murphy et al5 indicated
that even with up to 50% airway narrow￾ing in the preterminal bronchioles the dif￾fusion front hardly moved (by ∼1
generation proximally). This provides
compelling support to the fact that the
measured Sacin increases with increasing
BOS stage are indeed the result of worsen￾ing ventilation heterogeneity generated at
the level of the acinar entrance.

(BOS) status; asterisks indicate significant changes versus BOS=0 subjects. In addition, Sacin in
patients with BOS=1 or BOS=2 was not different from each other but significantly different from
Sacin observed in BOS=0 and BOS=3 patients.

CONCLUSION
In a cross-sectional study, the reduction in
FEV1 seen with BOS is associated with
functional changes generated around the
acinar entrance.
