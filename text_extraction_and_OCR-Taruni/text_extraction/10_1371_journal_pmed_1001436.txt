Abstract
Background: Calcimimetic agents lower serum parathyroid hormone levels in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD), but
treatment effects on patient-relevant outcomes are uncertain. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to
summarize the benefits and harms of calcimimetic therapy in adults with CKD and used cumulative meta-analysis to identify
how evidence for calcimimetic treatment has developed in this clinical setting.
Methods and Findings: Cochrane and Embase databases (through February 7, 2013) were electronically searched to
identify randomized trials evaluating effects of calcimimetic therapy on mortality and adverse events in adults with CKD.
Two independent reviewers identified trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Eighteen trials comprising 7,446
participants compared cinacalcet plus conventional therapy with placebo or no treatment plus conventional therapy in
adults with CKD. In moderate- to high-quality evidence (based on Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development,
and Evaluation criteria) in adults with CKD stage 5D (dialysis), cinacalcet had little or no effect on all-cause mortality (relative
risk, 0.97 [95% confidence interval, 0.89–1.05]), had imprecise effect on cardiovascular mortality (0.67 [0.16–2.87]), and
prevented parathyroidectomy (0.49 [0.40–0.59]) and hypercalcemia (0.23 [0.05–0.97]), but increased hypocalcemia (6.98
[5.10–9.53]), nausea (2.02 [1.45–2.81]), and vomiting (1.97 [1.73–2.24]). Data for clinical outcomes were sparse in adults with
CKD stages 3–5. On average, treating 1,000 people with CKD stage 5D for 1 y had no effect on survival and prevented about
three patients from experiencing parathyroidectomy, whilst 60 experienced hypocalcemia and 150 experienced nausea.
Analyses were limited by insufficient data in CKD stages 3–5 and kidney transplant recipients.
Conclusions: Cinacalcet reduces the need for parathyroidectomy in patients with CKD stage 5D, but does not appear to
improve all-cause or cardiovascular mortality. Additional trials in CKD stage 5D are unlikely to change our confidence in the
treatment effects of cinacalcet in this population.

Introduction
People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) [1] experience
mortality in excess of the general population largely because of
accelerated cardiovascular disease [2–4]. Although improvements
in care have occurred, people with advanced CKD treated with
dialysis (CKD stage 5D) experience annual mortality of approx￾imately 15% to 20% [5]. Despite intensive efforts, numerous
interventions to improve clinical outcomes in adults with CKD
have failed to demonstrate beneficial effects on mortality or
cardiovascular events, particularly for people treated with dialysis
[6–10].
CKD leads progressively to phosphorus retention, impaired
vitamin D activation, hypocalcemia, and increased parathyroid
hormone (PTH) secretion. However, while global clinical practice
guidelines suggest that serum PTH and phosphorus concentrations
should be kept within a target range [11], therapies that ameliorate
abnormal serum PTH and phosphorus levels (vitamin D
compounds and phosphorus binders) have not been shown to
improve clinical outcomes in randomized trials [12,13]. In 2004,
cinacalcet hydrochloride was approved in the United States to
lower elevated serum PTH levels in patients with CKD stage 5D
[14]. Cinacalcet mimics the action of calcium on calcium-sensing
receptors in the parathyroid glands to suppress PTH secretion
[15,16] and, based on promising data, has been considered a
potential intervention to prevent cardiovascular events and
mortality in CKD [17,18]. Within a decade of the first small
randomized trials for cinacalcet [19,20], and despite an earlier
meta-analysis showing no evidence for benefit on clinical outcomes
[21], cinacalcet prescribing has become the largest single drug cost
for dialysis patients in the United States, with an annual
expenditure of at least US$260 million, and community prescrib￾ing costs for cinacalcet in the United Kingdom increased by 20%–
33% from 2010 to 2011 [5,22]. A pooled analysis of four placebo￾controlled randomized trials of cinacalcet in 2005 showing a large
reduction in cardiovascular hospitalization with cinacalcet may
have contributed to uncertainty in the medical community about
the therapeutic benefits of cinacalcet therapy [18].
In light of widespread use and the recent publication of the
largest randomized trial of cinacalcet in dialysis patients [23], we
have conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to
summarize the available evidence that calcimimetic therapy
improves clinical outcomes in adults with CKD. In the context
of high cinacalcet prescribing costs despite an earlier meta-analysis
reporting no evidence for benefit [21], we have used cumulative
meta-analysis to evaluate the evidentiary basis for routine
cinacalcet administration in clinical practice over time.
Methods
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of
randomized controlled trials according to methods from a
previously published meta-analysis, and followed a published
peer-reviewed protocol [21] (Texts S1 and S2).
Data Sources and Searches
We conducted electronic searches in the Cochrane Renal
Group specialized register (through February 7, 2013) and Embase
(January 1, 2012 to February 7, 2013) using search terms relevant
to this review without language restriction (Table S1). The
specialized register contains studies identified from the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, handsearches
of kidney-related journals and proceedings of major conferences,
and searches of trials registries using search strategies based on the
scope of the Cochrane Renal Group (http://www.cochrane-renal.
org/crgtopics.php). We additionally searched Embase in the
previous year (January 1, 2012, through February 7, 2013) for
citations that were not automatically included in the specialized
register.
Study Selection
Two authors independently screened the search results by title
and abstract, then full text, to identify potentially eligible trials that
fulfilled the inclusion criteria. We considered all randomized
controlled trials of any calcimimetic agent (cinacalcet HCl, NPS
R-467, or NPS R-568) that reported data for adults with CKD
(any stage). We defined CKD according to the National Kidney
Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative, which
considers CKD to be present when there are structural kidney
and/or urine abnormalities with or without reduced estimated
glomerular filtration rate (below 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2
) [1]. We
have used standard nomenclature, referring to having an
estimated glomerular filtration rate below 60 ml/min per
1.73 m2 but not treated with dialysis as CKD stages 3–5, and
treated with dialysis as CKD stage 5D.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
Two authors independently extracted data for population
characteristics, interventions, nonrandomized cointerventions,
and risk of bias according to prespecified criteria from the
Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias [24] into a
purpose-built database. Each author double-checked data extrac￾tion and data entry independently, and any discrepancies between
authors were resolved by discussion. We extracted data for the
following outcomes: all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality,
parathyroidectomy, fracture, and treatment-related adverse events
(including hypocalcemia, hypercalcemia, nausea, vomiting, ab￾dominal pain, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, muscle
weakness or parasthesia, dyspnea, and headache). We also
extracted data for end-of-treatment serum PTH, phosphorus,
and calcium concentrations. Two authors independently evaluated
the following risk-of-bias items using standardized methods:
sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of patients
and study personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, analysis by
intention-to-treat methods, completeness of outcome data, selec￾tive reporting of outcomes, and other threats to validity (unequal
treatment comparisons, early termination of trial, industry sponsor
as author or involved in data handling and analysis) [24]. We also
recorded whether trials published after 2005 reported trial
registration in the primary trial report.
Data Synthesis and Statistical Analysis
For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the relative risk (RR)
and 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous outcomes, we
calculated the mean difference together with a 95% CI. Where
only proportions of participants experiencing an event were
provided in the trial report (instead of raw event data), we
estimated the number of participants experiencing one or more
events by multiplying the proportion affected by the sample size,
and contacted the trial authors or sponsors for additional
information. We summarized effect estimates using standard and
cumulative random effects meta-analysis. We assessed for hetero￾geneity in summary effects using the Cochran Q and the I
2 test
(with 95% CIs) [25]. We considered a p-value below 0.10 to
indicate significant heterogeneity. We analyzed data for all-cause
Calcimimetic Therapy in Chronic Kidney Disease

mortality, cardiovascular mortality, parathyroidectomy, hypocal￾cemia, nausea, and vomiting within subgroups for CKD compris￾ing adults with CKD stage 3–5 and CKD stage 5D. Insufficient
data were available to determine if treatment effects differed by
stage of CKD, and data were absent for kidney transplant
recipients. In cumulative meta-analysis, outcome data for all-cause
mortality, parathyroidectomy, hypocalcemia, and nausea from all
available trials were included sequentially according to the year in
which they first became available.
Additional prespecified subgroup analyses and univariate
random effects metaregression were performed to explore
potential sources of heterogeneity in treatment effects on all-cause
mortality, parathyroidectomy, hypocalcemia, and nausea. The
potential sources of heterogeneity included mean age of partici￾pants in the trial, proportion of male participants, baseline serum
PTH concentration, baseline serum calcium concentration, trial
duration, allocation concealment (adequate versus unclear), and
year of publication. In addition, for the outcome of hypocalcemia
we evaluated the serum calcium concentration used to define one
or more hypocalcemia events as a source of heterogeneity in
treatment effects for this outcome. Insufficient data were available
to evaluate whether dialysis modality (hemodialysis versus
peritoneal dialysis) modified treatment effect estimates. To assess
potential bias from small-study effects, funnel plots of the log risk
ratio in individual studies against the standard error of the risk
ratio were generated and formally assessed for asymmetry using
Egger’s regression test [26]. The Duval and Tweedie trim-and-fill
procedure [27] was used to quantify the possible effect of any
potential publication bias evident in the meta-analyses. For all
analyses, a two-tailed p-value,0.05 indicated statistical signifi￾cance. We conducted the analyses using Comprehensive Meta￾Analysis version 2 (Biostat) and SAS release 9.1 (SAS Institute).
We summarized the quality of the evidence, together with
absolute treatment effects based on estimated baseline risks, using
the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and
Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines [28]. Definitions of evidence
quality are as follows: high quality—further research is very
unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect;
moderate quality—further research is likely to have an important
impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change
the estimate; low quality—further research is very likely to have an
important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is
likely to change the estimate; very low quality—any estimate of
effect is very uncertain. To estimate the absolute number of people
with CKD who avoided death or parathyroidectomy or incurred
hypocalcemia or nausea with calcimimetic therapy, the risk
estimate and 95% CI were obtained from corresponding meta￾analyses, together with the absolute population risk for people with
each stage of CKD, derived from cohort studies and registry data
for all-cause mortality and parathyroidectomy and event rates in
the control arm of available trials for hypocalcemia and nausea
[5,29,30].

Results
We included eight randomized trials comprising 1,429 partic￾ipants from an earlier meta-analysis current through to March
2005 [21] and identified 244 additional citations using electronic
searching (Figure 1). We included 18 trials with 7,446 adults with
CKD (Table S2) in the systematic review and 17 studies with
7,424 participants in the meta-analyses. [19,20,23,31–45].
All included trials evaluated cinacalcet hydrochloride (referred
to as R-568 or AMG 073 in the four earliest trials [19,20,31,32]).
Cinacalcet in addition to conventional therapy (vitamin D
compounds and phosphorus-binding agents) was compared
against placebo and/or conventional therapy alone in all trials.
In three trials, the strategy for vitamin D co-therapy differed
between treatment arms [37,43,45]. The two earliest trials were
short-term evaluations of cinacalcet treatment (8 d [20] and 15 d
[19]) in adults with CKD stage 5D. Following these earliest trials
of safety and biochemical efficacy, the first larger scale trial of
cinacalcet therapy was reported in 2004 in 741 adults with CKD
stage 5D, and measured treatment efficacy based on intact PTH
concentrations [33]. Between 2004 and early 2012, 11 additional
trials were reported [35–45], although none was primarily
designed to evaluate treatment effects on patient-relevant
outcomes including mortality or adverse events. In late 2012,
the Evaluation of Cinacalcet Therapy to Lower Cardiovascular
Events (EVOLVE) trial in 3,883 participants with CKD stage 5D
was the first trial specifically designed to evaluate cinacalcet
treatment on patient-centered outcomes, using a primary com￾posite outcome of all-cause mortality or first nonfatal cardiovas￾cular event [23].
Cinacalcet treatment was given in the included trials generally
at increasing doses (usually 30 to 180 mg/d) targeted to serum
PTH concentrations, with discontinuation of therapy in the event
of PTH concentrations falling below a specific target and/or
hypocalcemia or adverse event (described in Table S3). In one
trial, the cinacalcet dose prescribed was unclear [45]. Overall, 16
trials comprised 6,988 people treated with CKD stage 5D
[19,20,23,31–34,36–41,43,44] and two trials comprised 458
patients with CKD stages 3–5 [37,43]. Of the 16 trials, 15
enrolled hemodialysis patients and one enrolled both hemodialysis
and peritoneal dialysis patients [36]. Follow-up duration ranged
between 8 d and 21.2 mo (median, 6.5 mo).
Risk of Bias in Individual Trials
Risk of bias is summarized in Figures 2 and S1. In general, risk
of bias was high or unclear in most studies for many domains we
assessed. The trial sponsor had authorship and/or was involved in
data collection, analysis, and interpretation in 15 trials (83%)
[19,20,23,31–37,40–43,45]. Of the ten trials reported since 2005
[23,37–45], half had evidence of registration within a trials registry
in the primary publication [23,39,42,43,45].
Outcomes
Mortality. Compared to placebo or no treatment, cinacalcet
had little or no effect on all-cause mortality (RR, 0.97 [95% CI,
0.89 to 1.05]) in high-quality evidence for people with CKD stage
5D, and imprecise effects on all-cause mortality in low-quality
evidence for people with CKD stages 3–5 (RR, 0.29 [95% CI,
0.06 to 1.48]) (Figure S2; Table 1). Cinacalcet had uncertain
effects on cardiovascular mortality for participants with CKD
stage 5D (RR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.16 to 2.87]) and CKD stages 3–5
(RR, 0.29 [95% CI, 0.06 to 1.48]) (Figure S3).
Need for parathyroidectomy. In high-quality evidence,
cinacalcet prevented surgical parathyroidectomy in people with
CKD stage 5D (RR, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.40 to 0.59]) (Figure S4).
Data for treatment effects on parathyroidectomy were not
available for adults with CKD stages 3–5.

Fracture. In two trials in adults with CKD stage 5D,
cinacalcet had imprecise and inconsistent effects on fracture
(RR, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.12 to 2.27]) (Figure S5), and data were not
available for adults with CKD stages 3–5.
Adverse events. Definitions of hypocalcemia and hypercal￾cemia in included trials are provided in Table S3. The cutoff for
the definition of hypocalcemia generally ranged between 1.88 and
2.10 mmol/l and that of hypercalcemia was 2.55 or 2.63 mg/dl.
In all stages of CKD, cinacalcet increased the risk of hypocalcemia
(RR, 7.38 [95% CI, 5.43 to 10.03]) (Figure S6), nausea (RR, 2.05
[95% CI, 1.54 to 2.75]), vomiting (RR, 1.95 [95% CI, 1.74 to
2.18]) (Figure S7), and diarrhea (RR, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.02 to 1.29])
(Table 2). Cinacalcet therapy reduced the risk of hypercalcemia
(RR, 0.23 [95% CI, 0.05 to 0.97]) (Figure S8). Cinacalcet had
uncertain effects on abdominal pain, upper respiratory tract
infection, muscle weakness or parasthesia, dyspnea, and headache
(Table 2).
Serum parathyroid hormone, phosphorus, and calcium
concentrations. Cinacalcet decreased serum PTH (mean
difference, 2281 ng/l [95% CI, 2326 to 2236]) and calcium
concentrations (mean difference, 20.22 mmol/l [95% CI, 20.25
to 20.19]), but had little or no effect on serum phosphorus
concentrations (mean difference, 20.07 mmol/l [95% CI, 20.19
to 0.04]) (Table S4).

Cumulative Meta-Analysis
Although the first large randomized trial designed to evaluate
effects of cinacalcet on mortality and cardiovascular events
reported its results only recently [23], cumulative meta-analysis
shows that it and numerous smaller trials conducted since 2000
have collectively signaled limited benefit for mortality, and
increased hypocalcemia and nausea (Figure 3). Specifically for
mortality, although the largest trial (EVOLVE) [23], including
nearly 4,000 participants, has just reported and increased our
certainty that cinacalcet therapy has little or no effect on risks of
death, cumulative treatment estimates for cinacalcet have not
changed materially over the previous decade. Similarly, when
examined collectively, earlier trials had identified the markedly
increased risks of hypocalcemia and nausea by 2005. Since then,
the accrual of approximately 6,000 further participants in
additional trials has not substantively altered estimates of excess
side effects, although they have increased our certainty in
treatment-related adverse outcomes. Notably for parathyroidecto￾my, the EVOLVE trial [23] has increased our confidence in the
effect of cinacalcet treatment and indicates smaller treatment
benefits than were observed in earlier studies.
Exploration of Heterogeneity and Sensitivity Analyses
Using univariate metaregression and subgroup analyses, we
explored mean age of participants in the trial, gender, baseline
serum PTH and calcium concentrations, duration of follow-up,
allocation concealment, and year of publication as sources of
heterogeneity in treatment effects for all-cause mortality, parathy￾roidectomy, hypocalcemia, and nausea. Analyses showed that
none of these variables modified estimates for all-cause mortality
or parathyroidectomy. Increasing trial-level age was associated
with increased risk of hypocalcemia and nausea (Table S5). We
also evaluated the serum calcium concentration used to define
hypocalcemia in individual trials as a source of heterogeneity and
observed that, as might be predicted, use of a higher cut point for
serum calcium to define hypocalcemia was associated with an
increased risk of this outcome. In subgroup analyses, trials in
which allocation concealment was adequate had statistically
similar estimates of treatment effect (mortality RR, 0.97 [95%
CI, 0.89 to 1.05]; hypocalcemia RR, 8.00 [95% CI, 5.66 to
11.32]; nausea RR, 2.03 [95% CI, 1.21 to 3.40]) to those trials
that had unclear allocation concealment (mortality RR, 0.92 [95%
CI, 0.56 to 1.51]; hypocalcemia RR, 5.84 [95% CI, 2.98 to
11.43]; nausea RR, 2.31 [95% CI, 1.42 to 3.77]) (p-value for
subgroup differences .0.4 for all). Subgroup analyses for effects of
allocation concealment were not possible for parathyroidectomy.
When we excluded the three trials in which randomized
cointervention strategies for vitamin D compounds were not
comparable between treatment arms [37,43,45], we observed
similar treatment estimates in dialysis patients (all-cause mortality
RR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.89 to 1.05]; cardiovascular mortality RR,
0.95 [95% CI, 0.84 to 1.08]; hypocalcemia RR, 6.72 [95% CI,
4.88 to 9.25]; nausea RR, 1.89 [95% CI, 1.38 to 2.60]; vomiting
RR, 1.98 [95% CI, 1.71 to 2.30]), although risks of hypercalcemia
became less certain (RR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.55 to 1.41]). When we
limited the analysis of all-cause mortality to trials that had a follow￾up of 6 mo or longer, we found the treatment effect was
unchanged (RR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.90 to 1.05]). We observed
asymmetry in the funnel plot for the outcome of all-cause
mortality, suggesting that small studies remained unpublished
(Egger’s regression test, p= 0.01). When we imputed five
potentially missing studies, the risk of all-cause mortality remained
unchanged (RR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.89 to 1.05]) (Figure S9). No
asymmetry was observed in funnel plots for hypocalcemia or
nausea, and data for parathyroidectomy were insufficient to allow
for detection of small-study effects.
We conducted sensitivity analyses to check the robustness of
treatment effect estimates and their precision when trials in which
zero events had occurred in one or both arms were available. We
used a continuity correction of 0.5 added to all cells for such trials
and found no substantive difference in the results. In addition to
the cumulative meta-analysis reporting treatment estimates over
Figure 2. Risk of bias in included studies (n = 18). Trials were adjudicated as free of selective reporting if they evaluated and reported the
following outcomes: all-cause mortality, hypocalcemia, and two or more gastrointestinal events (nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea).

time for all-cause mortality, parathyroidectomy, hypocalcemia,
and nausea, we evaluated the cumulative treatment effect
estimates for cardiovascular mortality before and after the
inclusion of the large EVOLVE trial [23]. In the absence of
EVOLVE, the summary RR for cardiovascular mortality was 0.25
(95% CI, 0.06 to 1.02), while including EVOLVE provided a RR
of 0.68 (95% CI, 0.32 to 1.45).
Discussion
In high- to moderate-quality evidence from 16 randomized
controlled trials involving 6,988 patients, routine cinacalcet (30 to
180 mg/d) therapy in people with CKD stage 5D decreases PTH
concentrations (281 ng/l [32 pmol/l]), reduces hypercalcemia,
and infrequently prevents surgical parathyroidectomy, but has
little or no effect on all-cause mortality, has imprecise effects on
cardiovascular death, and is associated commonly with adverse
effects including hypocalcemia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
On average, routinely treating 1,000 people for 1 y has no effect
on mortality, might prevent three patients from experiencing
surgical parathyroidectomy, and leads to approximately 60 and
150 patients experiencing hypocalcemia and nausea, respectively.
Evidence in people with CKD stages 3–5 is scant and generally
low or very low quality. Because of lower absolute risks of
parathyroidectomy in earlier stages of CKD, the benefits of
cinacalcet identified in dialysis populations are likely to be smaller
if generalized to people with CKD stages 3–5. Data for recipients
of a kidney transplant and those treated with peritoneal dialysis
were largely absent.
Although it remains possible that routine cinacalcet prescribing
has a beneficial effect on all-cause mortality, consistent treatment
effects across all the available studies providing data suggest that,
at best, any benefit for mortality is likely to be small. Given that lag
censoring analyses for outcomes (where data were censored 6 mo
after patients stopped using the study drug) were reported as
prespecified secondary analyses in the EVOLVE trial [23] and
suggested a potential benefit for cinacalcet on total mortality
(hazard ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.73 to 0.96]), it might be argued that
additional trials of cinacalcet are now needed or that cinacalcet
lowers mortality. However, we suggest that, given that lag
censoring approaches were secondary analyses and that overall
data for mortality in this meta-analysis are high-quality according
to GRADE criteria, additional placebo-controlled trials of
cinacalcet are very unlikely to change the confidence in the size
and direction of the treatment estimates we observed. By contrast,
given the low- to very-low-quality evidence currently available for
people with CKD stages 3–5, and the lack of available data to
allow analysis of whether treatment effects differ by stage of CKD,
additional trial data for this specific group of patients would be
informative.
Notably, the trials contributing to the analyses all sought to
investigate the use of cinacalcet as ‘‘routine’’ or ‘‘first line’’ therapy
for elevated PTH levels. Their findings therefore do not exclude
the possibility that cinacalcet may afford benefits in the treatment
of elevated PTH levels resistant to treatment with vitamin D
compounds and phosphate binders. The generally negative
findings of existing trials on patient-level end points have resulted
in clinical practice guideline recommendations that suggest that
cinacalcet should be used when serum parathyroid levels are very
high, other treatments have been ineffective, and surgical
parathyroidectomy is contraindicated [46]. However, the specific
use of cinacalcet in this clinical setting has not been adequately
evaluated in randomized trials, and, in particular, outcomes and

adverse events after parathyroidectomy versus cinacalcet have not
been studied.
Before the development of cinacalcet, vitamin D compounds
were the mainstay of therapy to normalize perturbed PTH
concentrations in CKD, which if left unchecked lead to painful
fractures, bone deformity, and generalized osteopenia. In a now
familiar sequence of events in nephrology, although vitamin D
therapy was effective for improving a surrogate outcome (lower
serum PTH levels) and was associated with lower mortality in
nonrandomized studies [47], subsequent randomized trials did not
clearly demonstrate beneficial effects of vitamin D compounds on
cardiovascular events or death for people with CKD [13].
Similarly, while cinacalcet was shown 10 y ago to markedly
improve surrogate outcomes (both serum PTH and calcium by
phosphorus product levels) in people with CKD [20], and
observational analyses suggest an association between cinacalcet
treatment and improved all-cause and cardiovascular mortality
[17], until recently, randomized trial evidence systematically
evaluating the effect of cinacalcet on clinical outcomes was not
available. Despite this vacuum of high-quality evidence for patient￾centered end points and cumulative data indicating frequent side
effects including hypocalcemia, nausea, or vomiting, cinacalcet has
become the most expensive drug cost and the eighth most
frequently prescribed drug for Medicare Part D enrolled dialysis
patients in the United States, and year-on-year prescribing costs
are increasing rapidly in the United Kingdom [5,22].
This meta-analysis shows that, although its use is widespread
and costly, cinacalcet provides small absolute benefits for
parathyroidectomy, provides no reductions in mortality, and
frequently leads to adverse gastrointestinal effects that may
adversely influence nutrition and quality of life in these patients.
Importantly, the effects of cinacalcet treatment on all-cause
mortality, parathyroidectomy, hypocalcemia, and nausea were
all identifiable before the EVOLVE trial [23] was released in late
2012, and the EVOLVE trial has now largely only increased our
confidence in treatment effects. The EVOLVE trial has addition￾ally provided us with important data for cardiovascular mortality,
showing that benefits of therapy on this outcome are lower than
cumulatively estimated by earlier trials. The EVOLVE trial was
needed to provide certainty and high-quality data that routine
cinacalcet use provides little or no benefit for adults treated with
dialysis; monitoring of prescribing data post-EVOLVE may now
reveal a fall in the prescribing costs and frequency of routine
cinacalcet administration in parallel with the high-quality evidence
available, although questions will remain as to why prescribing
costs became so high in the context of insufficient cumulated
evidence over the last decade. As with vitamin D compounds
previously, the pathway from drug development to clinical use for
cinacalcet reminds us that relying on surrogate end points and
nonrandomized studies to evaluate treatment efficacy for new
interventions is likely to result in unreliable estimates of clinical
effectiveness. This, in turn, leads to extensive use of interventions
that do not improve population outcomes and unnecessarily
increase healthcare expenditure.
The treatment effect we observed for cinacalcet on fracture
(RR, 0.53) was similar in magnitude to, but less certain than, the
risk estimate observed in a pooled analysis of four similarly
designed randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of
cinacalcet enrolling 1,184 participants with CKD stage 5D and
intact PTH concentrations of 300 ng/l or more, in which the RR
of fracture was 0.46 (95% CI, 0.22–0.95) [18]. It was unclear in
that publication which trials were included in the pooled analysis,
from which data for extended treatment in two trials including
about half the randomized participants were included. It is
possible that cinacalcet lowers the risk of fracture, but at this time,
treatment estimates based on published trial data summarized by
meta-analysis are imprecise and lower quality.
The current evidence for cinacalcet in this systematic review is
consistent with the UK National Health Service National Institute
for Health and Clinical Excellence guidance recommending that
cinacalcet should not be used for the routine treatment of elevated
serum PTH levels in people with CKD and should be limited to
people with elevated PTH concentrations refractory to standard
therapy, with a normal or high serum calcium concentration, and
in whom surgical parathyroidectomy is contraindicated because
the risks of surgery outweigh the benefits [46]. The data also
support the current US Food and Drug Administration approval
for cinacalcet, which is restricted to patients with CKD stage 5D
who have secondary hyperparathyroidism, although benefits of
treatment in this setting are limited to prevention of surgical
parathyroidectomy and avoidance of hypercalcemia [14]. At this
time, however, the available randomized evidence for cinacalcet
does not support the current Kidney Disease: Improving Global
Outcomes clinical practice guidelines suggesting that people with
CKD treated with dialysis and elevated or rising PTH levels
(beyond two to nine times the upper normal limit) receive vitamin
D compounds or calcimimetics or a combination to decrease
serum PTH levels to within the suggested range [11].
Although based on a peer-reviewed protocol and conducted
using methods developed by the Cochrane Collaboration, our
review has limitations that should be considered. First, data for
cinacalcet therapy were largely limited to adults with CKD stage
5D. Insufficient data were available to determine whether
treatment effects differed according to severity of CKD. Second,
data for recipients of a kidney transplant were absent, although as
in other stages of CKD, cinacalcet use may provide benefits
outweighing treatment hazards for people requiring parathyroid￾ectomy in whom surgical therapy is contraindicated. Third, due to
a relative absence of trials in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis,
treatment estimates for this specific group are uncertain. Finally,
because of the lack of head-to-head data in available trials, the
comparative effectiveness of cinacalcet versus vitamin D com￾pounds for patient-level outcomes remains uncertain.
In conclusion, cinacalcet therapy provides small reductions in
the risk of surgical parathyroidectomy but has little or no effect on
all-cause mortality and uncertain effects on cardiovascular death
for people with CKD and is commonly associated with nausea and
vomiting. Routine use of cinacalcet therapy in people with CKD
does not appear warranted, and benefits may be limited to
preventing parathyroidectomy in the small number of patients for
whom surgery is contraindicated. Additional trials in patients with
CKD stage 5D are unlikely to change the estimates of treatment
effects for cinacalcet.

Editors’ Summary
Background. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) refers to a
progressive loss in kidney function over time and is caused
by several conditions such as diabetes and high blood
pressure. CKD is an increasingly common condition, affecting
an estimated 26 million adults in the United States alone,
with millions more at risk. People with CKD are at increased
risk of death compared to the general population, and
despite recent improvements in care, people with advanced
CKD who are receiving dialysis experience an excess
mortality rate of up to 20%. People with CKD also experience
several biochemical imbalances—such as increased phos￾phorus (as a result of retention), low vitamin D and calcium
(hypocalcemia), and increased parathyroid hormone—which
lead to further health problems (such as a thinning of the
bones) and pain. In light of this complication, clinical
guidelines for people with CKD currently recommend that
the blood levels of phosphorus and parathyroid hormone be
maintained in a certain range to prevent the need for
surgical removal of the gland (surgical parathyroidectomy).
Why Was This Study Done? There are several medical
therapies that help to keep phosphorus and parathyroid
hormone blood levels within the target range, and in 2004,
the drug cinacalcet hydrochloride (cinacalcet) was approved
in the United States for use in people with end-stage CKD for
this purpose. However, despite increasing use and costs of
this drug (in the US, cinacalcet has become the largest single
drug cost for patients on dialysis, with an annual expenditure
of at least US$260 million, and in the UK, prescribing costs
increased by up to 33% from 2010 to 2011), the therapeutic
value of this drug remains uncertain. So in this study, the
researchers systematically reviewed appropriate published
studies and analyzed relevant data to investigate whether
treatment with cinacalcet improves clinical outcomes in
adults with CKD.
What Did the Researchers Do and Find? The researchers
identified relevant randomized controlled trials conducted in
participants with end-stage CKD by thoroughly searching
electronic databases and trial registries, specialist journals,
and major conference proceedings. They then extracted data
according to specific criteria and assessed the risk of bias.
The researchers then graded the quality of evidence into the
categories high, moderate, low, and very low quality.
Using these techniques, the researchers included 18 trials
involving 7,446 adults with CKD in their analysis. All included
trials evaluated cinacalcet (at a dose of 30 mg to 180 mg/
day) and how this drug compared to conventional therapy or
conventional therapy plus placebo. The researchers found
that, compared to placebo or no treatment, in high-quality
evidence, cinacalcet had little or no effect on all-cause
mortality (relative risk [RR], 0.97) for people in the final stage
of CKD (stage 5D) and unclear effects on all-cause mortality
in low-quality evidence for people in the less severe stages
(stages 3–5) of CKD (RR, 0.29). Cinacalcet also had uncertain
effects on cardiovascular mortality for participants with CKD
stage 5D (RR, 0.67) and CKD stages 3–5 (RR, 0.29), and also its
role in fracture prevention was unclear in people with CKD
stage 5D. Furthermore, cinacalcet had significant side effects,
such as increased risk of hypocalcemia (RR, 7.38), nausea (RR,
2.05), vomiting (RR, 1.95), and diarrhea (RR, 1.15), but
reduced the risk of hypercalcemia (RR, 0.23). The researchers
found that in high-quality evidence, cinacalcet prevented
surgical parathyroidectomy in people with CKD stage 5D (RR,
0.49). However, overall, they also found that, on average,
routinely treating 1,000 people with cinacalcet for one year
has no effect on mortality, prevents about three people from
experiencing surgical parathyroidectomy, and leads to
approximately 60 and 150 people experiencing hypocalce￾mia and nausea, respectively.
What Do These Findings Mean? These findings suggest
that routine cinacalcet (30 to 180 mg/day) therapy in people
with end-stage CKD (stage 5D) reduces parathyroid concen￾trations and hypercalcemia, and may prevent surgical
parathyroidectomy, but has little or no effect on all-cause
mortality, has an unclear effect on cardiovascular death, and
is frequently associated with adverse effects such as
hypocalcemia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea—adverse
gastrointestinal effects that may affect nutrition and quality
of life. Although the evidence in people with CKD stages 3–5
is limited and generally of low quality, this analysis shows
that despite the widespread use of cinacalcet and the
associated high costs, this drug provides little clinical benefit.
Therefore, routine use of cinacalcet therapy in people with
CKD does not appear warranted; benefits may be limited to
preventing parathyroidectomy in the small number of
patients for whom surgery is contraindicated.
