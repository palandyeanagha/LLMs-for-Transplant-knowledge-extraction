Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) is widely used in disease models to examine the contribution of receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK)
1 in cell death and inflammation. We studied three Nec-1 analogs: Nec-1, the active inhibitor of RIPK1, Nec-1 inactive (Nec-1i), its
inactive variant, and Nec-1 stable (Nec-1s), its more stable variant. We report that Nec-1 is identical to methyl-thiohydantoin￾tryptophan, an inhibitor of the potent immunomodulatory enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). Both Nec-1 and Nec-1i
inhibited human IDO, but Nec-1s did not, as predicted by molecular modeling. Therefore, Nec-1s is a more specific RIPK1
inhibitor lacking the IDO-targeting effect. Next, although Nec-1i was B100  less effective than Nec-1 in inhibiting human RIPK1
kinase activity in vitro, it was only 10 times less potent than Nec-1 and Nec-1s in a mouse necroptosis assay and became even
equipotent at high concentrations. Along the same line, in vivo, high doses of Nec-1, Nec-1i and Nec-1s prevented tumor necrosis
factor (TNF)-induced mortality equally well, excluding the use of Nec-1i as an inactive control. Paradoxically, low doses of Nec-1
or Nec-1i, but not Nec -1s, even sensitized mice to TNF-induced mortality. Importantly, Nec-1s did not exhibit this low dose
toxicity, stressing again the preferred use of Nec-1s in vivo. Our findings have important implications for the interpretation of
Nec-1-based data in experimental disease models.

Depending on the cellular context, tumor necrosis factor
(TNF) induces receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK)-1
and RIPK3 kinase-dependent necrotic cell death (regulated
necrosis or necroptosis).1–5 In certain conditions, such as
deficiency or inhibition of cIAPs, RIPK1 kinase activity can
mediate apoptosis.6–8 RIPK1 and RIPK3 interact through their
RIP homotypic interaction motif domain and initiate necrop￾tosis via phosphorylation-driven formation of a signaling
complex within TNFR1-induced complex II (the necro￾some).4,7 Necrostatin-1 ((Nec-1; 5-((1H-indol-3-yl)methyl)-3-
methyl-2-thioxoimidazolidin-4-one), originally identified in a
screen for chemical inhibitors of necrotic cell death in human
U937 cells,9 is an allosteric inhibitor of RIPK1.10 Nec-1 does
not affect RIPK1-mediated nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) activa￾tion,10 in line with the dispensable role of RIPK1 kinase activity
in this process.11 For several kinases, the catalytic activity is
regulated by the phosphorylation status of the activation
segment (T-loop), located in the kinase domain.12 The
unphosphorylated activation segment, locked into an inactive
conformation, is converted by phosphorylation into an active
conformation. Homology modeling using B-RAF as a tem￾plate, structure–activity relationship (SAR) and mutant ana￾lysis showed that Nec-1 stabilizes the inactive conformation of
RIPK1, functioning as an allosteric inhibitor.10
Because RIPK1 deficiency in mice causes postnatal death
due to its indispensable platform function leading to NF-kB13
and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling,14 Nec-1 has
been instrumental in studying the contribution of RIPK1
kinase-dependent necroptosis in various pathologies invol￾ving cell death.9,15–20 We previously reported that treatment
with Nec-1 or genetic ablation of RIPK3 protected mice from
lethality associated with TNF-induced systemic inflammatory

response syndrome (SIRS), suggesting that a RIPK1/RIPK3-
dependent pathway drives TNF-induced mortality.21 How￾ever, literature and our own observations raised some critical
issues regarding Nec-1’s specificity, its appropriate control
and the effective concentration especially in murine experi￾mental disease models. Regarding the kinase specificity of
Nec-1, of 98 human kinases, only PAK1 and PKAca are
partially inhibited by Nec-1.22 Targets of Nec-1 activity other
than RIPK1 have also been suggested, for example, in T-cell
receptor signaling.23 The Nec-1 analog, Nec-1 stable (Nec￾1s) (7-Cl-O-Nec-1) was 41000-fold more selective for RIPK1
than for any other kinase out of 485 human kinases.24 Another
issue is that RIPK1 kinase activity is not only confined to
necroptosis but is also involved in ERK activation25 and in
apoptosis when IAP is depleted.6–8 Altogether, these results
argue for a careful interpretation of the biological effect after
in vivo Nec-1 administration. Moreover, a selection of
appropriate controls and consideration of the effective
concentrations is very important in interpreting the results
obtained using Nec-1. Strikingly, before being identified as a
RIPK1 kinase inhibitor, Nec-1 under its alternative name
methyl-thiohydantoin-tryptophan (MTH-Trp) had been
described as an inhibitor of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase
(IDO).26 IDO, which is an immune regulator,27 catalyzes the
first and rate-limiting step of tryptophan catabolism, leading to
the formation of kynurenine.28 IDO activity is induced by
several pro-inflammatory stimuli, including lipopolysacchar￾ides, bacterial DNA and type I/II interferons.29–31 Mounting
data suggest that IDO controls the flux between the pathways
leading to pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokine production.32
IDO activity is induced in patients with shock and trauma,33
and blockage or deficiency of IDO partially protects mice
against endotoxemia.34 Kynurenine has also been identified
as an ‘endothelium-derived relaxing factor’ mediating inflam￾mation-induced pathological hypotension.35 Clearly, targeting
IDO by Nec-1/MTH-Trp might be important in some in vivo
models of inflammation. Therefore, we examined IDO
inhibitory activity of Nec-1 and its derivatives.
The second issue relates to differential RIPK1 inhibitory
potencies of Nec-1 derivatives. Nec-1 consists of an
indoleamine and a thiohydantoin moiety, also called thioxo￾imidazolidinone. The SAR analyses of Nec-1 revealed that
elimination of the methyl group in the thiohydantoin moiety
completely abolished its inhibition of human RIPK1 and of
TNF-induced necroptosis in Fas-associated protein with
death domain (FADD)-deficient Jurkat cells, a human T cell
line.10 Demethylated Nec-1 is referred to as Nec-1 inactive
(Nec-1i) (5-((1H-indol-3-yl)methyl)-2-thioxoimidazolidin-4-
one). It is often used as an inactive control in studies using
Nec-1 to exclude nonspecific off-target effects inherent to
inhibitors. Moreover, a small group substitution at the seventh
position of the indole of Nec-1 and a change from thiohy￾dantoin to hydantoin strongly enhanced its inhibitory activ￾ity.10,36 One variant also improved in vivo stability: Nec-1s or
7-Cl-O-Nec-1 (5-((7-chloro-1H-indol-3-yl)methyl)-3-methyli￾midazolidine-2,4-dione) was effective in reducing brain
injuries.9,18 Surprisingly, we found that the ‘inactive’ Nec-1i
still inhibited TNF-induced necroptosis in mouse cells and
became equipotent at higher concentrations. Furthermore,
it was equipotent to Nec-1 in protecting against lethal
TNF-induced SIRS in vivo. As Nec-1i is inactive on purified
recombinant human RIPK1 but active in cellular and in vivo
conditions, at least in the mouse system, a third issue is
raised. What is the optimal concentration for administering
Nec-1 in vivo and how to discriminate it from its ‘inactive’
variant Nec-1i? These issues prompted us to compare the
inhibitory activities of Nec-1, Nec-1i and Nec-1s on human
RIPK1 kinase, human IDO, mouse cellular necroptosis and in
an in vivo necroptosis model, namely TNF-induced SIRS.21
Results
Characterization of Nec-1, Nec-1i and Nec-1s on a RIPK1
and RIPK3 kinase assay and on TNF-induced necropto￾sis. SAR analysis revealed that Nec-1i, which lacks a methyl
group on the thiohydantoin moiety, lost its RIPK1 inhibitory
activity, whereas substitution of thiohydantoin with hydantoin
and introduction of chlorine at position 7 of the indoleamine
moiety yielded a more stable inhibitor, Nec-1s, also called
7-Cl-O-Nec-1.9,10,36 We performed an in vitro kinase assay
using recombinant human RIPK1or RIPK3 in the presence
and absence of these compounds. RIPK1 autophosphoryla￾tion was evident and was potently inhibited by Nec-1 and
Nec-1s in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1b). Nec-1s
was equipotent to Nec-1, confirming published results.9,10,36
The demethylated variant of Nec-1, Nec-1i, only showed
minor inhibitory activity on human RIPK1 autophosphoryla￾tion at the highest concentration (100 mM) (Figure 1c),
indicating a more than 100-fold lower inhibitory activity of
Nec-1i as compared with Nec-1. In addition, none of the
compounds was able to block RIPK3 autophosphorylation
(Figure 1c), confirming that these compounds specifically
target RIPK1 and not RIPK3 in the necroptotic pathway.10
Next, we compared the efficiency of these compounds to
modulate TNF-induced necroptosis in mouse L929sA cells.
This cellular assay surprisingly revealed only about 10-fold
lower inhibitory activity of Nec-1i compared with Nec-1
(Figure 1d). This relatively minor difference between Nec-1
and Nec-1i on mouse cells is in contrast with the absence of
any inhibitory activity of Nec-1i on human FADD-deficient
Jurkat cells.10 From these experiments, we conclude that
Nec-1i retains some inhibitory activity on TNF-induced
necroptosis on mouse cells, which becomes equipotent at
higher concentrations (10–100 mM) (Figure 1d). Although the
exact mechanism of this protection by Nec-1i is not known, it
may either reflect a species specificity, the existence of
additional targets or metabolization of Nec-1i resulting in an
active compound. Whatever the reason may be, it is obvious
that this observation has important implications for the use of
Nec-1i as a control in mouse experimental disease models.
Nec-1 and Nec-1i, but not Nec-1s, are predicted to inhibit
IDO with similar potency. Nec-1 has been identified as a
specific inhibitor of RIPK1 kinase activity.9,10 However, Nec-1
is identical to MTH-Trp, which has been described as a
potent inhibitor of IDO.26 The substrates of IDO are
indoleamines, such as tryptophan, serotonin, melatonin and
tryptamine.37 Hence, typical IDO inhibitors are indoleamine￾containing compounds, including 1-methyl-tryptophan
(1-MT)38 and MTH-Trp.26 Ample studies have used Nec-1

to inhibit RIPK1 kinase activity, but a potential IDO-inhibiting
effect in cellular or experimental disease models has not
been addressed before.
Nec-1, Nec-1i, Nec-1s and 1-MT contain an indole moiety
also present in L-tryptophan, the substrate of IDO (Figure 2a).
The crystal structures of human IDO (pdb-entries 2D0T and
2D0U) reveal the active site as a small distal pocket located
adjacent to the heme. The orientation of the ligand’s indole
moiety within this pocket is expected to be near-perpendicular
versus the heme, with N1 and C2 in the vicinity of the iron ion,
as to allow iron-bound dioxygen to react with the indole ring in
accordance with the proposed mechanism.39 We suspected
that the chlorine substituent of Nec-1s/7-Cl-O-Nec-1 might no
longer allow the indole ring to fit properly in the enzyme’s
narrow pocket. Subsequently, we have docked the substrate
L-tryptophan (L-Trp), the known IDO inhibitors (1-MT and Nec￾1/1-MTH-Trp) and the Nec-1 derivatives (Nec-1i and Nec-1s)
into the active site of human IDO pdb-entry 2D0T, using the
automated docking program AutoDock-Vina.40 This crystal
structure contains 4-phenylimidazole nitrogen-bound to the
heme’s iron ion. In preparing the enzyme’s structure model for
docking, this ligand was removed, leaving the heme unoccu￾pied. Given the enzyme’s mechanism, ligand docking poses
that leave no room for iron-bound molecular oxygen were
dismissed.
With L-Trp, a docking pose was obtained, showing an indole
position and orientation within the active site’s pocket that
corroborates the proposed mechanism (Figure 2b); its amino￾acid moiety resides in the tunnel-like entrance to the pocket.
Ser167 protruding from the surface of the pocket is in the
vicinity (4.6A˚) of C7 of the indole moiety (Figure 2c). This
docking pose allows sufficient space for molecular oxygen
(Figure 2d). A similar overall pose was obtained with Nec-1
(Figure 2e) and at first sight also with Nec-1s (Figure 2f). Next,
we docked the L enantiomer of all ligands (L-Trp, 1-MT, Nec-1,
Nec-1i and Nec-1s) (Figure 3a) and calculated the distances

of the respective indole’s H1 and C2 to the heme’s iron to
assess the spatial relationship between the ligand and the
molecular oxygen (red-mesh lines in Figures 2e and f;
Figure 3). The D enantiomer of all ligands docked in a similar
fashion (result not shown). The positioning of the indole ring of
all ligands, except for Nec-1s, allows the accommodation of
iron-bound dioxygen (Figure 3b), which is a prerequisite for
substrate and competitive inhibitor binding.39 However, a
similar pose with Nec-1s results in a smaller H1-Fe distance
as compared with the other ligands (Figure 3b). Indeed, the 7-
Cl substitution in Nec-1s induces steric hindrance with the
protruding Ser167 at the pocket’s surface, causing a tilt of
the indole ring, thereby bringing its H1 closer to the iron ion of
the heme, leaving no room for molecular oxygen. This
suggests that Nec-1s, in contrast to Nec-1 and Nec-1i, will
not bind and inhibit IDO, a prediction that was experimentally
tested (next section).
Nec-1 and Nec-1i, but not Nec-1s, inhibit IDO enzyme
activity. As docking predicted differential binding of Nec-1
and its variants on IDO (Figure 3), we tested these
compounds together with a prototype IDO inhibitor 1-MT in
an IDO enzyme assay. Both Nec-1 and Nec-1i inhibited
IDO with a comparable EC50 to 1-MT (Figure 4a). In
contrast, Nec-1s did not inhibit IDO (Figure 4a), as predicted
by molecular docking (Figure 3b). These results indicate
caution when interpreting results using these compounds
in cellular assays or in vivo because Nec-1 is not only a

the missing iron-bound dioxygen. (e) The docked pose of Nec-1 shows a symmetrical distance between the heme’s iron and position 1 or 2 of the indole ring, also allowing
sufficient space for dioxygen. (f) For the analogous pose of Nec-1s, the indole ring is slightly tilted due to a steric clash of Ser167 with the indole’s 7-Cl substituent. This brings
the indole ring substantially closer to the heme, suggesting that this pose no longer leaves sufficient space for molecular oxygen, or that Nec-1s may be unable to fit into the
pocket of dioxygen-bound IDO

RIPK1 inhibitor but also a potent IDO inhibitor. Also,
Nec-1i potently inhibits IDO, as predicted by the docking
model. In contrast, Nec-1s is a more specific and therefore
superior RIPK1 inhibitor. As all these compounds share
the indole moiety, we questioned whether IDO inhibitors,
such as 1-MT, would interfere with cellular necroptosis.
1-MT did not show any inhibitory activity on TNF-induced
cytotoxicity on L929 cells at any concentration tested, ruling
out that IDO inhibitors in general could directly interfere with
necrotic cell death (Figures 4b and c).

In vivo Nec-1i is as protective as Nec-1 against lethality
associated with TNF-induced SIRS. We have reported
that pretreatment with Nec-1 protected against lethal SIRS
caused by in vivo administration of TNF.21 Because both
Nec-1 and Nec-1i possess IDO inhibitory activity and IDO is
an important immunomodulatory molecule, we tested Nec-1i
in this model as well. Mice were pretreated with Nec-1 or
Nec-1i before challenge with a lethal dose of mTNF using the
same dose regimen as described before.21 Nec-1 protected
against TNF-induced hypothermia and lethality as reported
earlier (Figures 5a and b). Rather surprisingly, Nec-1i
protected equally well (Figures 5a and b), which is in line
with the equipotent inhibition in the cellular necroptosis assay
at higher concentrations (Figure 1d). Thus, the inhibitory
effect of Nec-1i might be due to the high dose of compounds
reaching equipotent concentrations in target organs, which
could mask the difference in the effective dose. In addition,
in vivo pharmacodynamics and metabolization may also
contribute to the equal protection. In order to discriminate
between Nec-1 and Nec-1i in vivo activities, we examined the
dose response in this model.
Nec-1 and Nec-1i sensitize towards TNF-induced SIRS
when administered at a lower dose. We evaluated the

dose response of both compounds using half (3 mg/kg,
designated moderate (Mo)) and one-tenth (0.6 mg/kg,
designated low (Lo)) of the initial dose (6 mg/kg, designated
high (Hi)), assuming that the lower doses might reveal a
differential protective effect between Nec-1 and Nec-1i. The
half dose was still as protective as the initial dose (Figures 5c
and d). Surprisingly, at the lowest dose both Nec-1 and Nec￾1i even sensitized mice to TNF-induced shock, evidenced by
accelerated hypothermia and decreased survival rate
(Figures 5c and d). Importantly, these results indicate that
at a lower dose both Nec-1 and Nec-1i gain a toxic effect,
making it impossible to establish differences by subsaturat￾ing doses. The toxic effect is a specific in vivo phenomenon
as it was not observed in vitro in the cellular necroptosis
assay (Figure 1d).
Next, we questioned whether the sensitizing effect of Nec-1
involved cell death processes. We have shown earlier that
inhibition of necroptosis by Nec-1 or RIPK3 deletion resulted
in reduced release of cellular content into circulation.21 The
levels of the liver enzymes aspartate aminotransferase and
alanine aminotransferase, as well as the cellular disintegra￾tion marker lactate dehydrogenase, increased by TNF
administration in the control group in a highly significant
manner, as reported earlier.21 Creatinine levels rather
declined after TNF administration, most likely reflecting
muscle catabolism (Figure 5e). Pretreatment with Nec-1 at
high dose reversed these changes almost completely
(Figure 5e), indicating protection against cytolysis, as
reported previously.21 Pretreatment with Nec-1 at low dose
did not increase the levels of most of these soluble markers,
suggesting that mechanisms other than cellular damage are
involved in sensitization.
Nec-1s protects against TNF-induced SIRS without
sensitization effect. As Nec-1s is a potent inhibitor of
RIPK1 and cellular necroptosis (Figures 1b and c) while
lacking IDO inhibitory activity (Figure 4a), we tested it in the
TNF-induced SIRS model with doses that were protective
(Hi: 6 mg/kg) and sensitizing for Nec-1 (Lo: 0.6 mg/kg). Nec￾1s protected as well as Nec-1 at the high dose, but did not
sensitize at the low dose. In the same experimental set-up,
Nec-1 exhibited protection or sensitization pending on the
dose used (Figures 6a and b), confirming previous findi￾ngs (Figures 5c and d). Pretreatment with Nec-1s at high
dose provided statistically significant protection.
Pretreatment at a lower dose was comparable to the control
group. Therefore, Nec-1s is not only a more specific inhibitor
that does not interfere with IDO but is also a superior inhibitor
suitable for use in vivo lacking a paradoxical sensitizing effect
in TNF-induced lethality. As all Nec-1 derivatives were
protective at high dose, this effect most probably is mediated
by RIPK1 inhibition. On the other hand, because Nec-1 and
Nec-1i, but not Nec-1s, were able to block IDO in vitro,
we speculate that the sensitizing effect of Nec-1 and Nec-1i,
but not Nec-1s, at lower dose in vivo may involve IDO
targeting, although further research is required to support
this hypothesis.
Discussion
Nec-1 has been described as a specific inhibitor of RIPK1
activity, efficiently protecting cells from TNF-induced necropto￾sis.9,10 Nec-1 has been widely used to examine the involvement
of RIPK1 activity in cell death and inflammation in murine
disease models. However, some critical issues concerning its
in vivo use are emerging. We addressed three major questions
on the specificity, the appropriate control and the effective dose
of Nec-1 and its derivates, Nec-1i and Nec-1s.
Nec-1s is 41000-fold more selective than any other kinase
out of 485 human kinases.24 Nec-1 was recently found to
inhibit two other kinases,22 indicating that Nec-1-mediated
protection may involve targets other than RIPK1 activity. NO￾induced necroptosis41 and inhibition of T-cell proliferation23
are inhibited by Nec-1 independently of RIPK1 kinase activity,
suggesting also in vivo the existence of additional targets. The
chemical identity of Nec-1 and MTH-Trp as RIPK1 inhibitor9,10
and as IDO inhibitor26 may complicate the interpretation of the
in vivo effects of Nec-1. As IDO is upregulated in inflammation
and has a major immunomodulatory role, double reactivity on
RIPK1 and IDO may have important in vivo implications.
Molecular modeling predicted that Nec-1 and Nec-1i, but not
Nec-1s, would inhibit IDO. The 7-Cl on the indole in Nec-1s
probably causes steric hindrance, resulting in a tilting of the
indole ring in the IDO catalytic pocket. The first step of the IDO
reaction requires substrate binding involving the iron dioxygen
at the heme of the catalytic pocket. The tilted indole ring of
Nec-1s probably no longer competes with the substrate
(Figure 2d and Figure 3a). This prediction was confirmed by
an enzymatic IDO assay. The differential inhibition of IDO by
Nec-1/1-MTH-Trp and Nec-1i versus Nec-1s provides a good

avenue to avoid interference of IDO targeting. However, 1-
MT, a classical IDO inhibitor,26 had no effect in the cellular
necroptosis assay, excluding the direct implication of IDO in
necroptosis.
A second important issue is the use of Nec-1i, a
demethylated variant of Nec-1, as an inactive control. Nec-1i
is 4100-fold less active on human recombinant RIPK1 than
Nec-1 and Nec-1s, in line with previous reports.9,10,36 In
contrast to the absence of any effect on necroptosis in human
FADD-deficient Jurkat cells,9,10,36 in mouse L929 cells, Nec-1i
consistently inhibited necroptosis only 10-fold less than Nec￾1, even resulting in complete inhibition at higher concentra￾tions. This surprising observation may reflect species speci￾ficity of Nec-1i. By methylation of its thiohydantoin moiety in
some cells or even in vivo, Nec-1i might be converted to a
Nec-1-like inhibitory compound. In line with this partial
necroptosis blocking activity of Nec-1i in cellular systems,
we found that Nec-1i administration in vivo also inhibits TNF￾induced SIRS. These findings argue against the in vivo use of
Nec-1i as a ‘silent’ control because Nec-1i can still target IDO,
and in mice, it is apparently equipotent to Nec-1 in blocking
TNF-induced SIRS. It would be worthwhile to check whether
the demethylated form of Nec-1s could be a negative control
for RIPK1 targeting on cells and in vivo.
There is a third issue. Mice were sensitized to TNF-induced
SIRS when 10-fold lower doses of Nec-1/MTH-Trp or Nec-1i
were administered (0.6 mg/kg). This paradoxical finding has
major implications for the interpretation of dose-dependent
effects of Nec-1 in murine experimental disease models and
may also explain some controversies in the literature. Indeed,
in contrast to our earlier publication,21 Nec-1 was reported to
exacerbate TNF-induced SIRS.42 Another group also
reported that Nec-1 worsens the outcome of a peritoneal
sepsis model.43 Both publications concluded that RIPK1
kinase activity is necessary for survival from sepsis. However,
in these reports, the dose of Nec-1 used was comparable to
the low dose in Figures 5 and 6, explaining the sensitizing
effect. From the current study, we argue that this sensitization
is not the result of RIPK1 targeting and necroptosis. First,
cellular necroptosis assays at low concentrations of Nec-1
and Nec-1i do not show such sensitization. Second, Nec-1s,
which is an equipotent RIPK1 inhibitor,9,10,36 does not
sensitize TNF-induced SIRS. Third, sensitization at these
low doses of Nec-1 and Nec-1i is not accompanied by the
enhanced presence of tissue-damage markers, suggesting
that toxicity mechanisms other than RIPK1-mediated necrop￾tosis may be involved. This sensitization was not shared by
Nec-1s. Therefore, the involvement of RIPK1 can be
excluded. Because both Nec-1 and Nec-1i target IDO,
whereas Nec-1s does not, the blocking of IDO could be
implicated. This remains to be investigated. Another issue is
that these compounds may be metabolized differently,
generating toxicity in one case and not in the other. In this
regard, it is interesting to note that hydantoinase activity has
been reported in mammalian cells, which corresponds to
dihydropyrimidinase activity.44 Such enzymes can partly
hydrolyze thiohydantoin compounds, and thiohydantoins
have been described as unstable under typical biochemical
incubation conditions.45,46 That thiohydantoin-containing
necrostatins, such as Nec-1 and Nec-1i, exhibit a sensitizing
phenotype at a low dose is in contrast to the nonsensitizing
phenotype of Nec-1s, a hydantoin variant. Thiohydantoins
and hydantoins might be metabolized differently, generating
different metabolites.
Our data indicate some major issues concerning the
specificity, the appropriate control and the dose of Nec-1
and its derivatives, and may have major implications for the
use in experimental disease models and the interpretation of
the published data. Many conclusions drawn on the use of
Nec-1 in experimental disease models may require reevalua￾tion. The use of Nec-1s, which does not target IDO, provides a
perfect alternative. Moreover, considering the increasing
number of pathological conditions involving RIPK1/RIPK3-
dependent necroptosis, Nec-1s may offer a promising
therapeutic option for the treatment of these conditions.
Nec-1 is still a commercially available option, which can only
be used in conditions where involvement of IDO is clearly
excluded by use of 1-MT.
Material and Methods
Cells, cytokines and reagents. L929sAhFas cells were generated as
previously described47 and are referred to as L929sA cells for simplicity. Cells
were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10%
fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml) and L-glutamine
(0.03%). The recombinant mouse TNF used for in vivo experiments and human
TNF for in vitro experiments were produced in Escherichia coli and purified in our
laboratories. The activity and endotoxin contamination of mTNF, determined by
MTT assay and the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay (Kabivitrum, Trenton, NJ,
USA), was 1.7  108 IU/mg and 0.47 EU/mg, respectively. Activity of human TNF
used in vitro was 3.3  108
IU/mg. The 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT;
Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used at 500 mg/ml. Nec-1 (full name, 5-
((1H-indol-3-yl)methyl)-3-methyl-2-thioxoimidazolidin-4-one) and Nec-1i (full name
5-((1H-indol-3-yl)methyl)-2-thioxoimidazolidin-4-one) were purchased from Calbio￾chem (San Diego, CA, USA). Nec-1s (full name, 5-((7-Cl-1H-indol-3-yl)methyl)-3-
methylimidazolidine-2,4-dione) was prepared and kindly provided by Brigham and
Women’s Hospital, Inc, Boston. See website for structures and nomenclature
(http://www.nature.com/nchembio/journal/v1/n2/compound/nchembio711_ci.html).
1-MT (Sigma Aldrich) was dissolved in PBS.
In vitro kinase assay. Recombinant human RIPK1 (aa 1–497) and
RIPK3 (aa 1–439) were produced in Sf9 insect cells as GST-fusion proteins.
GST-fusion constructs were obtained by cloning hRIPK1 and hRIPK3 cDNA into
the BamHI restriction site of the pAcGHLT vector (BD Bioscience Benelux N.V.,
Erembodegem, Belgium), and recombinant baculovirus was obtained after
cotransfection of these constructs with BaculoGold linearized baculovirus (BD
Biosciences) into Sf9 cells according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sf9 cell
pellets were resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA,
0.5% (v/v) Igepal CA-630 and EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablets
(Roche Diagnostics Belgium N.V., Vilvoorde, Belgium). Lysates were incubated on
ice for 30 min. Insoluble proteins were removed by centrifugation. The supernatant
was applied to a Glutathione Sepharose 4FF column (GE Healthcare, Diegem,
Belgium) preequilibrated with PBS pH 7.4. The GST-tagged RIP kinase was eluted
from the column with 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl and 10 mM reduced
glutathione. Fractions containing the RIP kinase were pooled and further purified
using a Superdex 75pg column (GE Healthcare; running buffer: 20 mM Tris–HCl
pH 8.0 and 100 mM NaCl). The purity of the fractions was checked by means of
SDS-PAGE, and the RIP kinase fractions were pooled and stored at  70 1C. For
in vitro kinase assays, recombinant human RIPK1 and RIPK3 (0.2 and 0.75 mg,
respectively) were incubated in 30 ml kinase assay buffer (20 mM HEPES-KOH,
pH 7.5, 2 mM DTT and 10 mM MnCl2 (for RIPK1) or 10 mM MgCl2 (for RIPK3,
respectively) supplemented with 10 mM cold ATP and 10 mCi 32P-g-ATP for 30 min
at 30 1C in the presence of different concentrations of Nec-1, Nec-1i and Nec-1s.
The amount of DMSO was equal in all samples. Samples were separated by SDS￾PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and exposed to chemilumines￾cence films (Amersham Hyperfilm ECL, Amersham, GE Healthcare, Diegem,
Belgium). After obtaining the autoradiogram, GST-hRIPK1 and GST-hRIPK3

IDO enzymatic assay. The assay has been described in detail elsewhere.48
Recombinant human IDO was expressed and purified as described.49 The IC50
inhibition assays were performed in a 96-well microtiter plate as described
before.49 Briefly, the reaction mixture contained 50 mM potassium phosphate
buffer (pH 6.5), 40 mM ascorbic acid, 400 mg/ml catalase, 20 mM methylene blue
and B27 nM purified recombinant IDO per reaction. The reaction mixture was
added to the substrate, L-tryptophan (L-Trp), and the inhibitor. The Nec-1/MTH-Trp,
Nec-1i and Nec-1s compounds were serially diluted in three-fold increments,
ranging from 100 mM to 1.69 nM, and the L-Trp was tested at 100 mM (Km ¼ 80
mM). The reaction was carried out at 37 1C for 60 min and stopped by the addition
of 30% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The plate was incubated at 65 1C for 15 min to
convert N-formylkynurenine to kynurenine and was then centrifuged at 1250  g
for 10 min. Finally, 100 ml supernatant from each well was transferred to a new
96-well plate and mixed at equal volume with 2% (w/v) p-dimethylamino￾benzaldehyde in acetic acid. The yellow color generated from the reaction with
kynurenine was measured at 490 nm using a Synergy HT microtiter plate reader
(Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT, USA). The data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4
software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).
In vitro cell death assay. L929 cells were seeded the day before analysis at
1  104 cells in 100 ml per well in 96-well adherent plates suitable for imaging
purposes. The next day, cells should have a confluence rate of maximal 80% upon
induction of cell death. For short-term assays (o6 h), nuclear staining with, for
example, PI (3 mM final concentration) and Hoechst (1 mM) was included with the
treatment. For long-term assays, PI/Hoechst staining was performed at least
30 min before measurement. Image acquisition was performed using a BD
Pathway 885. Images of at least 1000 cells were taken using a  10 objective and
the image montage feature of the equipment. Data acquisition and data analysis
were performed using the Attovision software package, BD Bioscience Benelux
N.V. A segmentation mask, identifying each single nucleus as region of interest
was set on the Hoechst image. The measurement parameter for cell death is the
% of PI-positive nuclei.
Molecular docking. Protein molecule A of the human IDO crystal structure
2D0T,39 containing the inhibitor 4-phenylimidazole as well as two molecules of 2-
(N-cyclohexylamino)ethane sulfonic acid in its active site, was selected for docking
experiments with AutoDock-Vina40 using AutoDockTools50 for preparations of
enzyme and ligands. Except for the heme group and its central iron ion, all waters
and non-covalent ligands were removed. Both enantiomers of all ligands were
docked, these were drawn in 3D with Avogadro51 and were minimized with the
MMFF94 force field.52 Vina box settings were: size x, y ¼ 16 A˚ and z ¼ 18 A˚
centered at x ¼ 59.2, y ¼ 53.2 and z ¼ 20.7; docking exhaustiveness was set at
32. Only those poses were evaluated of which the indole group was found in the
small cavity where the original 4-phenylimidazole resides.
Mice. Female C57BL/6J WT mice matched for gender and age were
purchased from Janvier (Le Genest, France). All mice were bred and housed at
the VIB Department for Molecular Biomedical Research in the specific pathogen￾free animal facility. All experiments on mice were conducted according to
institutional, national and European animal regulations. Animal protocols were
approved by the ethics committee of Ghent University. Mice were used at the age
of 8–14 weeks.
Injections and monitoring. mTNF and inhibitors were diluted in endotoxin￾free PBS and injected in a volume of 0.2 ml. Nec-1, Nec-1i and mTNF (7,5 mg)
were injected intravenously unless otherwise indicated. Inhibitors were given
17 min before mTNF injection. Control mice received an equal amount of DMSO
(6%) dissolved in PBS before the mTNF challenge. Rectal body temperature was
recorded with an electric thermometer (model 2001; Comark Electronics, Norwich,
UK). Body temperature and mortality were monitored for 48 and 72 h, respectively.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using Prism software
(GraphPad Software, Inc.). Body temperature is shown as means±S.E.M. and
compared with one-way analysis of variance with Bonferoni posttest. Survival
curves were compared using log-rank Mantel–Cox test.
