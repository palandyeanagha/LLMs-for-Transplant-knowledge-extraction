Summary
Mycobacterium abscessus and Kocuria species are rare causes of
infections in humans. Endocarditis by these agents has been


reported in only 11 cases. M. abscessus is a particularly resistant
organism and treatment requires the association of antibiotics for a
prolonged period of time. We report a case of native mitral valve
bacterial endocarditis due to M. abscessus and Kocuria species in a
48-year-old man with a history of intravenous drug use. The case
was complicated by a perforation of the posterior mitral valve
leaflet, leading to surgical mitral valve replacement. Cultures from
the blood and mitral valve disclosed M. abscessus and Kocuria
species. The patient was treated for 6 months with clarithromycin,
imipenem and amikacin, with resolution of symptoms. Repeated
blood cultures were negative. Acid-fast staining should be done in
subacute endocarditis in order to identify rapidly growing
mycobacteria.
