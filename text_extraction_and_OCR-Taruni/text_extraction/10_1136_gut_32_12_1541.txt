Wilson's disease in Scotland
R H R Park, P McCabe, G S Fell, R I Russell
Abstract
The prevalence and clinical features of
Wilson's disease in Scotland were investigated.
Thirty three cases were identified but
adequate information was available on only 28.
In 1989, the prevalence rate was 4 per million.
Ten patients with a mean (SEM) age of 18 (1.9)
years presented with neurological symptoms,
12 patients aged 14 (1.7) years presented with
hepatic symptoms, and six patients aged 12
(0.9) years were asymptomatic siblings of
patients with Wilson's disease. Nine (56%) of
the 16 patients who underwent liver biopsy on
presentation were found to have cirrhosis.
Peniciliamine treatment was stopped in nine
patients because of: abnormal peripheral
blood count (6), rash (2), and patient's own
choice (1). Nineteen patients were alive in 1989
- 12 were well, one had chronic liver failure,
four chronic neurological disabilities, and two
had both chronic liver failure and neurological
disabilities. Twelve patients died from:
complications of chronic liver failure (2), acute
liver failure (4), pneumonia associated with
immobility (4), and other causes (2). Several
patients who died had received incomplete
medical supervision.

In 1912 Kinnier Wilson concluded that
progressive lenticular degeneration was a rare
disease. He had found only seven cases in the
published reports for that time, to which he
added another four.' In 1968, Sternlieb and
Scheinberg estimated the prevalence of Wilson's
disease to be five per million.2 Since then they
have raised their estimated worldwide prevalence
to 30 per million,3 basing this on studies from the
USA,4 East Germany,5 and Japan.6 Using this
estimate, Parkes argued that there could be 1500
cases in Great Britain,7 with at least 1000
unrecognised cases.78 The increased estimated
prevalence for Wilson's disease produced an
uncomfortable concern in the minds of many
gastroenterologists and neurologists who were
apparently failing to detect the majority of cases
of this treatable disorder.9
Despite much quoted worldwide prevalence
data,3 very few complete epidemiological studies
have been carried out,"''2 most studies being
restricted to groups of patients to determine the
gene frequency. 13-16 To date the only mention of
the prevalence of Wilson's disease in Scotland
has been in a letter commenting on the seemingly
low prevalence in the north of Scotland.9 In
1981, Walshe found only 24 cases in East Anglia,
(population 3 376 981) giving a prevalence of 7. 1
per million.8
This study aimed to determine the prevalence
of Wilson's disease in Scotland and the clinical
features of the disease and to audit the clinical
management of the patients.
Methods
Patients were considered to have Wilson's
disease if the following criteria were met: a
plasma copper concentration <10 [imol/l
(normal range 15-25 Fimol/l) with at least two
other features including urinary copper >1-5
iimol/l (normal <0-8 imol/1), serum caerulo￾plasmin <80 mg/l (normal 150-300 mg/l),
hepatic copper >250 ,ug/g dry weight of tissue
(normal 15-60 [tg/dry weight of tissue), or the
presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings.
Patients with Wilson's disease were identified
from three sources. Firstly, from computerised
records of the Scottish Hospital Inpatient
Statistics (SHIPS) over the 15 year period 1974-
89.'7 Secondly, from a review of death certificates
during the same period of time. Thirdly, by
postal questionnaire to all gastroenterologists,
neurologists, and paediatricians working in
Scotland (questionnaire response rate 73%). We
had initially thought that the SHIPS figures
would be the most accurate method of detecting
patients in Scotland as we presumed that each
patient would require at least one hospital
admission. There were, however, several errors
in the information from SHIPS, resulting partly
from the diagnostic coding. Wilson's disease, in
the International Code for Diagnosis (ICD 8)
appears under section 273.3 'other and
unspecified congenital disorders of metabolism'
and in the 1977 revision (ICD 9) under section
275.1 'disorders of mineral metabolism'.'8 19
Other disease were commonly wrongly coded as
Wilson's disease, indicating the importance of
accurate input of information.
Results
PATIENT IDENTIFICATION
During the study period to 1989, 33 cases (20
female) were identified in Scotland (1989
population 5090 700).2' In 1989, 21 of the 33
patients were still alive, giving a point prevalence
of 4 per million Adequate information was
available for 28 of the 33 patients (16 females).

time taken to reach the diagnosis for both groups
was 1X3 (0.4) years. There was considerable delay
(> 1 year) in reaching the diagnosis in nine of the
patients (three in the hepatic group and six in the
neurological group) (Table II). One patient
attended several psychiatrists and neurologists
for two years before the diagnosis of Wilson's
disease was made, despite having a family history
of Wilson's disease. Most cases have been
diagnosed since 1975 (Table III).
METHODS OF DIAGNOSIS
At presentation all symptomatic patients had
abnormal clinical signs. Kayser-Fleischer rings
were present in 20, absent in four, and not
looked for in another four (Table IV). Six patients
(2 1%) were asymptomatic siblings of patients
with Wilson's disease. All patients had routine
blood tests including liver function tests (LFTs),
which were abnormal in 79% of the total group.
All the hepatic group patients had abnormal
LFTs, and surprisingly all the asymptomatic
patients had considerably raised transaminase
activities (three to four times normal). Serum
copper was low in all patients except the two who
presented with acute liver failure. In 75% of all
patients, urinary copper excretion was also
estimated. Serum caeruloplasmin values were
checked in 20 patients (71%) and were uniformly
low. On presentation, the peripheral blood count
was abnormal in 32% of all patients.
Fourteen patients had a liver biopsy performed
on presentation, two patients at necropsy after
presentation with acute liver failure, two patients
at necropsy after chronic liver failure, and in 10
patients a liver biopsy was never performed
(Table V). At presentation, all of the patients in
the hepatic group who had had a liver biopsy
were found to have either fibrosis or cirrhosis,
four of seven in the neurological group had
cirrhosis, and all three asymptomatic patients
were found to have either mild fibrosis or normal
liver histology. Hepatic copper was measured in
eight patients on presentation (one in a necropsy
sample) and was found to be mean (range) 1386
(136-4177) ig/g dry weight of tissue (normal
reference range 15-60 [ig/g dry weight of tissue)
(Table VI).
TREATMENT
All patients except the two who presented with
fulminant liver failure were begun on
penicillamine. This was stopped in nine patients
because of an abnormal peripheral blood count
(6), rash (2), and patient's own choice (1). Four
of the six patients who developed an abnormal
blood count had a moderate thrombocytopenia
(platelet count 80-150 000x 106/1) that seemed to
have been the result of drug therapy, and two
patients had a pancytopenia that was probably
caused by hypersplenism rather than drugs.
Seven patients were established on trientine
without any further problems.
Only one patient had received a short course of
oral zinc therapy. Five patients did not comply
with regular drug treatment and could therefore
be considered to have been inadequately treated.
One patient who defaulted from follow up and

required a liver transplant, but died two months
afterwards. One other patient had surgery for
portal hypertension.
LIVER HISTOLOGY/COPPER AFTER TREATMENT
Liver biopsies were performed after treatment in
nine patients and liver histology was examined in
a further three patients at necropsy after a follow
up of 10-3 years (range 2-25 years) (Table VI).
The liver histology was unchanged in six patients
with known cirrhosis and in two patients with
normal histology. One patient's histology
continued to show fatty change. In one of the
asymptomatic patients, repeat biopsy specimen
was normal after having shown fatty change with
fibrosis two years previously. Necropsy histology
was available for three patients who were all
found to have cirrhosis.
Follow up hepatic copper concentrations were
available for six patients, although only four of
them had had a pretreatment estimation. All four
OTHER CLINICAL CONDITIONS
Two patients developed epilepsy (one Jacksonian
seizures) one and two years after diagnosis. Both
patients had a normal brain computed tomogram.
Two patients developed symptomatic gall
stones. One ofthem required a cholescystectomy.
Other clinical conditions included alcoholism
(1), recurrent abortions (1), and acute pan￾creatitis (1).
HOSPITAL SUPERVISION
At the time of the study (1989) or at the time of
death, 23 patients were or had received adequate
hospital supervision and follow up, but five
patients had not attended a hospital clinic for
several years (Table VII).
FOLLOW UP
Twelve of the 33 patients identified have died, 10
of conditions directly attributable to Wilson's
disease and two from other disorders (Table
VIII). One of the patients who died from chronic
liver failure complicated by massive variceal
bleeding had been advised inappropriately by a
general physician to stop penicillamine four
months before his death as he was thought to
have drug induced thrombocytopenia rather
than the true cause of hypersplenism. Another
unfortunate patient, an asymptomatic case, had
stopped penicillamine on her own accord 18
months before presenting in acute liver failure.
Nineteen of the 28 patients were alive at the
end of the study and had been followed up for a
mean of 13.7 years (range 2-33 years). Twelve
were well and symptom free, four were disabled
by neurological problems, one had chronic liver
failure, and two had both severe chronic liver
failure and neurological disability.

Discussion
We have found from this epidemiological study
that the prevalence rate for Wilson's disease in
Scotland is 4 per million, which is considerably
lower than the previous estimation of 30 per
million.3 There are several explanations for this
discrepancy. Firstly, there may be a variation in
the prevalence rates in different geographical
areas, although a difference of this magnitude
would be unusual. Secondly, we may have failed
to pick up the majority of cases in Scotland.
Lastly, the previous estimations have been
incorrect. We believe that the last explanation is
the most likely and that there has been wide￾spread confusion and misquotation over the

epidemiological data and definitions in the
previous studies.
In 1984, Scheinberg and Sternlieb raised their
1968 prevalence estimate for Wilson's disease
from 5 per million to 30 per million.3 Their
estimation was based on three sources. Firstly,
data from the mortality figures for the USA for
the years 1968-78 showed that the average
number of deaths from Wilson's disease was
13-21 per million.4 Scheinberg and Sternlieb felt
that the rate probably represented half the true
value. Secondly they quoted a study by Bachman
from East Germany' whom they claimed had
found an 'incidence rate for WD to be 29 per
million - about six times the prevalence rate we
had estimated in 1968'. Bachman, however,
actually reported an annual 'incidence rate' of
2-9 per 100 000 live births. In fact, Bachman
found 78 patients who were alive in 1974
(population of East Germany 16.9 million),
which gave a prevalence rate of 4.6 per million.
Lastly, Scheinberg and Sternlieb used data from
a Japanese study by Saito involving 287 families,'
and stated that he had found the prevalence to be
33 per million. Saito's study assessed the value of
screening for Wilson's disease using serum
caeruloplasmin and was not an epidemiological
study of the prevalence of Wilson's disease in
Japan. Saito used only 162 families to estimate
the gene frequency and hence the 'disease
frequency'. There are also major methodological
errors, in particular his use of Dahlberg's formula
to calculate the geire frequency from a retrospec￾tive study (personal communication, Professor J
M Connor). It is not clear how many patients
were alive during the period of the study and the
hypothetical value for 'disease frequency' of one
in 30 000 for homozygotes (33 per million) is not
equivalent to disease prevalence. Unfortunately,
many articles on Wilson's disease written since
1984 have used Scheinberg and Sternlieb's
estimate and their sources.3 Giagheddu's study
from Sardinia found a high gene frequency rate
and a prevalence rate of 16.4 per million for
1981.12
Our study has confirmed the frequent delay
(mean 1[3 years) in reaching a diagnosis of
Wilson's disease,1222 23 and that the initial mis￾diagnosis was usually psychiatric.23 As in other
studies, our patients with hepatic disease
presented at an earlier age compared with the
patients presenting with neurological or
psychiatric problems (Table I).22 23 Unlike other
studies, including two British ones,8 16 that have
shown a high proportion of men (around 52-
65%)10 12 15 24 we found that only 40% of our group
were male.
Some 43% of our patients presented with
predominantly hepatic problems, and one
patient developed fulminant hepatic failure
complicated by intravascular haemolysis and
renal failure.25 Roche-Sicart et al,26 and sub￾sequently McCulloch et al,27 have documented
the clinical features of these patients and have
suggested that those with fulminant hepatic
failure caused by Wilson's disease have higher
serum copper concentrations, a less pronounced
increase in serum transaminase activities, a
higher concentration of total bilirubin, and lower
haemoglobin concentrations than patients with
idiopathic fulminant hepatic failure. Patients
with Wilson's disease who present with or
develop acute fulminant hepatic failure should
be considered for immediate liver trans￾plantation.
The diagnosis of Wilson's disease can be
difficult if serum caeruloplasmin values are not
particularly low and Kayser-Fleischer rings are
absent. Sternlieb has also suggested that urinary
copper excretion is often misleading because of
inaccurate collection.28 All of our patients had
unequivocally raised urinary copper excretion
values and we have found urinary copper
estimations to be useful.
It is surprising that hepatic histology was
available for only 50% of the 12 patients who
presented with hepatic disease. (Histology was
available for 58% of the whole group.) Clinicians
may be reluctant to submit their patients for liver
biopsy if they feel confident about making a
diagnosis of Wilson's disease based on clinical
findings and other laboratory tests, and when it
is known that standard light microscopic
examination of hepatic tissue is rarely pathog￾nomonic for this disorder.3 We feel that biopsy is
an important investigation as pathognomonic
changes to the hepatic mitochondria can be
found using electron microscopic techniques,3
and the liver copper concentration can also be
measured. Moreover, Wilson's disease patients
presenting with chronic active hepatitis have a
poor outcome and should be considered for early
liver transplant.29 Lau et al found a good
correlation between serum caeruloplasmin
values and the severity of the liver damage, and
suggested that serum caeruloplasmin may be a
useful prognostic marker.30 We have not been
able to assess this finding because of the small
number of patients who had a liver biopsy.
However, both patients who died from compli￾cations of chronic liver disease had higher serum
caeruloplasmin values than the rest of the group.
Hepatic copper was measured after treatment
in only six patients, and unfortunately in only
four of them was there a pretreatment value for
comparison. Despite good clinical response and
improvement in the LFTs, all six patients still
had grossly raised copper values, although in
four these had fallen by 37 (14)% (mean (SEM)).
In 1987, Scheinberg et al reported very high
hepatic copper values in patients successfully
treated with penicillamine and suggested that the
mode of action of penicillamine was not its
decoppering effect but one of detoxification,
possibly by induction of metallothioneins in the
liver.3' Further histological studies have shown
that copper is complexed with metallothionein in
patients with Wilson's disease.32 Mason et al
found that both penicillamine and trientine did
not reduce the copper values of 35S labelled
copper metallothionein in preparations of rat
liver cytosol as compared with thiomolybdate
which stripped the copper from the cytosol
proteins and may have a 'true' decoppering
effect.33
In 1960 Bearn reported that before treatment
for Wilson's disease was available the average age
at death was 30-6 years.'5 Our study has shown a
high mortality for patients with Wilson's disease
in Scotland, all of whom had received treatment

after presentation. Of the 33 patients identified,
12 had died during the period 1975-89. The
average age at death was 29'2 years, range 8-49.
Several patients were not adequately treated as
a result of non-compliance. Tragically, an
asymptomatic patient decided to stop treatment
and developed acute liver failure 18 months
later. Scheinberg et al have found that patients
who do not comply with their treatment are well
for 2 to 3 years then develop rapid liver failure,34
as shown by case reports by Walshe3s and
Breen.36 Giagheddu et al found that the median
survival of patients who received inadequate
treatment was only 6 years 4 months, but of 45
patients who received adequate treatment, only
three died. 12 Several patients in our study did not
receive optimal hospital supervision and it is of
some concern that at the end of the study period
five patients were not attending a hospital clinic
on a regular basis. Many of those attending
hospital, however, did not receive ideal treat￾ment, especially specialised supervision of their
chronic liver disease from which many patients
died. To ensure the best prognosis, patients with
Wilson's disease should attend a specialist
hospital clinic for regular review. This is of
particular importance for asymptomatic patients
detected by screening, as adequate treatment
ensures an excellent long term prognosis.37
