Abstract
Background: Overweight and obesity prevalence are commonly used for public and policy communication of the
extent of the obesity epidemic, yet comparable estimates of trends in overweight and obesity prevalence by
country are not available.
Methods: We estimated trends between 1980 and 2008 in overweight and obesity prevalence and their
uncertainty for adults 20 years of age and older in 199 countries and territories. Data were from a previous study,
which used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate mean body mass index (BMI) based on published and
unpublished health examination surveys and epidemiologic studies. Here, we used the estimated mean BMIs in a
regression model to predict overweight and obesity prevalence by age, country, year, and sex. The uncertainty of
the estimates included both those of the Bayesian hierarchical model and the uncertainty due to cross-walking
from mean BMI to overweight and obesity prevalence.
Results: The global age-standardized prevalence of obesity nearly doubled from 6.4% (95% uncertainty interval
5.7-7.2%) in 1980 to 12.0% (11.5-12.5%) in 2008. Half of this rise occurred in the 20 years between 1980 and 2000,
and half occurred in the 8 years between 2000 and 2008. The age-standardized prevalence of overweight increased
from 24.6% (22.7-26.7%) to 34.4% (33.2-35.5%) during the same 28-year period. In 2008, female obesity prevalence
ranged from 1.4% (0.7-2.2%) in Bangladesh and 1.5% (0.9-2.4%) in Madagascar to 70.4% (61.9-78.9%) in Tonga and
74.8% (66.7-82.1%) in Nauru. Male obesity was below 1% in Bangladesh, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and
Ethiopia, and was highest in Cook Islands (60.1%, 52.6-67.6%) and Nauru (67.9%, 60.5-75.0%).
Conclusions: Globally, the prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased since 1980, and the increase has
accelerated. Although obesity increased in most countries, levels and trends varied substantially. These data on
trends in overweight and obesity may be used to set targets for obesity prevalence as requested at the United
Nations high-level meeting on Prevention and Control of NCDs.

Background
Excess body weight is an important risk factor for mortality
and morbidity from cardiovascular diseases, diabetes,
cancers, and musculoskeletal disorders, causing nearly
three million annual deaths worldwide [1-5]. In previ￾ous work, we used a systematic analysis of data from
population-based health examination surveys and epi￾demiologic studies to estimate trends in mean body mass
index (BMI) between 1980 and 2008 in 199 countries and
territories in 21 regions [6]. The results demonstrated the
extent of the rise in BMI, and its similarities and differ￾ences, across countries and regions. This work, however,
provided limited information on the prevalences of
overweight and obesity, at the regional level and for
two years, 1980 and 2008, only. Data on the prevalence
of overweight and obesity by country and their trends
are needed for two reasons: first, although epidemiologic
studies have shown that ischemic heart disease, ischemic
stroke, and diabetes are linearly associated with measures
of excess body weight from low levels, some other
outcomes, including hemorrhagic stroke, may have
thresholds at higher levels [1,3,5]. Second, prevalence
estimates are commonly used for public and policy
communication of the extent of the obesity epidemic;
hence there is great demand for such information. In
this paper, we advance our previous work by estimat￾ing trends in overweight and obesity for all countries
and regions.
Methods
Overview
We estimated 1980 to 2008 trends in the prevalence of
overweight, defined as BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2
, and obesity,
defined as BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2
, by sex, for 199 countries and
territories. We estimated prevalences using the relationship
between prevalence and mean BMI, applied to esti￾mates of mean BMI from a previously published sys￾tematic analysis of health examination surveys and
epidemiological studies [6]. We also estimated the un￾certainties of prevalence estimates, accounting for the
uncertainties of mean BMI and those of converting
from mean to prevalence.
Mean BMI by sex, age group, country, and year
Mean BMI was from a previous systematic analysis of
population-based data, by sex and age group, for 199
countries and territories, described in detail elsewhere
[6]. In summary, we reviewed and accessed published
and unpublished health examination surveys and epide￾miologic studies to collate comprehensive data on BMI,
screened for being representative of populations studied.
This review led to a total of 960 country-years of data,
with 9.1 million participants. Of these, 369 were nationally
representative. We applied a Bayesian statistical model
that systematically addressed missing data, non-linear time
trends and age associations, national vs. subnational and
community representativeness of data, and data that were
from only rural or urban populations. Using these data
and methods, we estimated mean BMI trends and their
uncertainties by sex, country, and age group for adults
≥ 20 years.
The uncertainty of the estimated mean BMI accounted
for sampling uncertainty in the original data sources; un￾certainty associated with interannual fluctuations in na￾tional data, due to unmeasured study design factors, or
because some surveys did not have sample weights; un￾certainty associated with data sources that were not na￾tional, due to variation across communities in each
country; uncertainty associated with converting between
different metrics of excess body weight; and uncertainty
due to using a model to estimate mean BMI by age
group, country, and year when data were missing. As
described elsewhere, we fit the Bayesian model using the
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm and
obtained samples from the posterior distribution of
model parameters, reflecting the above sources of uncer￾tainty, which were in turn used to obtain samples from
the posterior distribution of mean BMI [6,7]. Five thou￾sand posterior draws of mean BMI by age, sex, country,
and year were generated.
Estimating the prevalences of overweight and obesity
from mean BMI
We developed regressions to estimate overweight and
obesity prevalences from mean BMI. The dependent vari￾able in each regression was the logit of the prevalence;
the independent variables were mean BMI, age (mid-year
of age group), sex, year of survey, and whether the coun￾try was high income. We used logit transformation to
restrict the estimated prevalences between 0 and 1. We
modeled the relationship using a cubic spline of mean
BMI because the association was nonlinear (Figure 1);
see below for sensitivity to this functional form. We
included year in the regressions to reflect changes in
the mean-prevalence relationship over time. Ideally, we
would have used a very flexible function of year. How￾ever, fewer sources with individual-level data were
available in the terminal years of the analysis, with data
for males virtually absent in the 1980s. To avoid poten￾tially spurious effects when extrapolating year effects to
years when data were very sparse, we set the year vari￾able to 0 prior to 1993. For other years, we used the
difference between two splines, one with knots in 1993,
1998, and 2003, and the other with knots in 1998, 2003,
and 2008, the last year of the analysis. This difference
increases linearly with year between 1998 and 2003,
and is attenuated in the tails, when data are most
sparse (see below for sensitivity of results to the

inclusion of year and choice of year function). Our final
model was:
Logit Pr ð Þ¼ β0 þ β1m þ β2m2 þ β3ms1 þ β4ms2
þ β5ms3 þ β6ms4 þ β7a þ β8s þ β9y
þ β10h þ β11y  h ð1Þ
where Pr is prevalence of overweight/obesity, m is
mean BMI, ms1 – ms4 are BMI spline segments, a is the
midpoint of age for each age group, s is an indicator
variable taking the value 0 for males and 1 for females,
y is the smooth function of year described above, and h
is an indicator variable taking the value 1 for high￾income countries and 0 for all other countries. To fit
the “cross-walking” regressions, we used mean BMI,
and prevalence of overweight and obesity from 243
population-representative health examination surveys
for which we had access to individual-level data (gener￾ating 1884 age-sex observations). We used sample
weights when analyzing survey data. We fit the model
using ordinary least squares regression, and list the esti￾mated β values in Table 1.
The uncertainty of the estimated prevalences included
those of mean BMI from the Bayesian model, described
elsewhere [6,7] and summarized above, and the uncertainty
associated with converting mean to prevalence. For each of
5,000 draws of mean BMI (which comprises mean BMI
values for every age-sex-country unit), we sampled a set of
regression coefficients from the fitted regression described
above, taking into account the covariance of the regression
coefficients. We also sampled from the error term of
the fitted regression. We then used the sampled re￾gression coefficients and error term corresponding to
each draw to calculate the prevalence of overweight/
obesity, resulting in 5,000 predictions for each age,
sex, country, and year unit. We calculated uncertainty
as the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of the distribution of
predicted prevalences.
We tested the sensitivity of our model to our treat￾ment of BMI and of year, and found that the model was
not sensitive to these choices. If we include a linear year
term in equation (1), the average relative difference be￾tween country predicted values using the two models is
0.6% (overweight model) and 6.0% (obesity model) prior
to 1993, and 0.3% (overweight model) and 0.7% (obesity

model) from 1993 onward. After excluding a year term
from the model altogether, the average relative difference
between country predicted values using the two models
is 2.6% (overweight model) and 10.0% (obesity model)
prior to 1993, and 0.7% (overweight model) and 2.2%
(obesity model) from 1993 onward. Likewise, treating
mean BMI as a quadratic function had only a small
average effect on predictions – the average relative
difference of country predictions was 0.2% for over￾weight and 0.7% for obesity – but residual plots indi￾cated that the predictions for very high and very low
mean BMIs were biased.
For each analysis year, country, and sex, we calculated
age-standardized prevalences of overweight and obesity
using the World Health Organization (WHO) standard
population [8], with age-standardization done for each
draw. We report the linear trends in age-standardized
prevalence over the 28 years of analysis. To estimate
trends, for each posterior draw, country, and sex, we
regressed age-standardized prevalence of overweight and
of obesity on year. We calculated uncertainty of the esti￾mated trends as the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of the re￾gression coefficients across 5,000 posterior draws. We also
report the posterior probability (pp) that an estimated in￾crease or decrease corresponds to a truly increasing or de￾creasing BMI trend, calculated as the proportion of 5,000
regression coefficients that have the same sign as the mean
regression coefficient. Posterior probability would be 0.50
in a country or region in which an increase is statistically
indistinguishable from a decrease, and a larger posterior
probability indicates more certainty.
Results
The fitted regression equations between prevalence and
mean population BMI had an R2 of 0.97 for overweight
and 0.92 for obesity (Figure 1; Table 1). Overweight and
obesity prevalences increased over time for any mean
population BMI, indicating that above and beyond in￾creasing mean BMI, there is a widening of the BMI dis￾tributions. After accounting for mean BMI and other
predictors, women had higher prevalence of obesity, an
effect that was stronger at low mean BMIs. Our pre￾dicted age-standardized prevalences of overweight ran￾ged from 2.6% in Vietnamese women in 1980 to 93.6%
in Nauru men in 2008, and of obesity from 0.3% in
Vietnamese men in 1980 to 74.8% in Nauru women in
2008 (Additional file 1).
Globally, the age-standardized prevalence of over￾weight increased from 24.6% (95% uncertainty interval
22.7-26.7%) in 1980 to 34.4% (33.2-35.5%) in 2008. The
prevalence of obesity increased from 6.4% (5.7-7.2%) in
1980 to 12.0% (11.5-12.5%) in 2008. Half of this rise
(2.8 percentage points absolute increase in prevalence)
occurred in the twenty years between 1980 and 2000,
when the global prevalence of obesity was 9.3% (9.1-9.6%);
the other half occurred in the 8 years between 2000 and
2008. In absolute numbers, this represents an increase
from 572 (527–621) million overweight adults in 1980 to
1.46 (1.41-1.51) billion in 2008. Of these, 508 (486–530)
million were obese in 2008.
In 1980, the age-standardized prevalence of overweight
among men ranged from 2.8% (1.4-5.1%) in Vietnam to
over 50% in 10 countries: Andorra, Cook Islands, Czech

Republic, Ireland, Lithuania, Malta, Nauru, Samoa, Slovenia,
and Tonga (Figure 2; Additional files 2 and 3). Among
women, overweight prevalence was also lowest in
Vietnam (2.6%; 1.1-5.0%) and was under 5% in seven
other countries in South and Southeast Asia and Central
and Eastern Africa. It was over 50% in 29 countries in
Eastern, Central, and Western Europe, the Caribbean,
Oceania, North Africa, the Middle East, and Southern
Africa. By 1990, more than 50% of women were over￾weight in 47 countries, a number that increased to 74 in
2000 and to 101 in 2008. By 2008, the lowest prevalence
of overweight among women was 8.0% (5.1-11.7%) in
Bangladesh. Female overweight prevalence was also below
10% in Ethiopia, Madagascar, and Nepal; at the other
extreme, it reached over 90% in Cook Islands, Nauru,
and Tonga. Male overweight in 2008 ranged from 5.8%
(1.7-13.3%) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to
over 90% in the Cook Islands and Nauru (these countries
also had prevalences of overweight greater than 90%
without age standardization). More than half of men were
overweight in 100 countries in 2008. In both 1980 and
2008, the correlation between the male and female preva￾lence of overweight was 0.85.
In 1980, the age-standardized obesity prevalence in
men ranged from 0.3% (0.1-0.5%) in Vietnam to 27.5%
(10.3-44.5%) in Nauru (Figure 2; Additional files 2 and 4).
Female obesity was as low as 0.3% (0.1-0.7%) in Vietnam,
reaching 30.6% (17.2-43.5%) in Kuwait and 32.0%
(11.2-52.3%) in Nauru. Male obesity was below 1% in 20
countries and female obesity was below 1% in 11 coun￾tries in South and Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.
By 1990, the prevalence of obesity among women was

greater than 25% in 26 countries in Oceania, North Africa
and Middle East, the Caribbean, and also in Moldova, the
Netherlands, and South Africa; by 2008, this number
increased to 80 countries. By 2000, obesity in women
already exceeded 50% in four countries in Oceania; these
four countries were joined by Kuwait and five more coun￾tries in Oceania by 2008. In 2008, female obesity ranged
from 1.4% (0.7-2.2%) in Bangladesh and 1.5% (0.9-2.4%)
in Madagascar to 70.4% (61.9-78.9%) in Tonga and 74.8%
(66.7-82.1%) in Nauru. In 2008, the prevalence of male
obesity was below 1% in three countries: Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia and Bangladesh. More
than one half of men were obese in Cook Islands (60.1%,
52.6-67.6%) and Nauru (67.9%, 60.5-75%). Between
1980 and 2008, the correlation between the male and
female prevalence of obesity increased slightly from
0.82 to 0.86.
In 1980, one half of the 572 million adults in the world
with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 lived in China (72 million), the
United States (70 million), and five other countries (Russia,
India, Germany, Italy, and Ukraine). In 2008, the countries
with the most overweight people were China (241 million)
and the United States (158 million). Half of the world's
1.46 billion overweight people were living in these two
countries and seven others: India, Russia, Brazil, Mexico,
Germany, Indonesia, and Turkey. The largest absolute
increase in the number of overweight people was in
China (169 million in 28 years) and the United States
(88 million). The largest absolute increase in number of
obese people occurred in these two countries (56 million
in the United States and 42 million in China), followed by
Brazil (20 million) and Mexico (18 million).
The regions with the lowest prevalence of obesity in
1980 were South and Southeast Asia, East, Central, and
West Sub-Saharan Africa, with prevalences ranging from
1.1% to 1.9% (Figure 3). Central and Eastern Europe
had the highest prevalence of obesity (16.3-18.2%) in
1980. Regional patterns of overweight were similar
(Figure 4). By 1990, North America was also among the
regions with the highest prevalence of obesity (17.6%,
15.9-19.4%), surpassing other regions by 2000 when
obesity prevalence reached 24.9% (23.5-26.3%). Due to
its large increase in obesity, Southern Latin America
also joined regions with high prevalence of obesity by
2000 (22.2%, 19.8-24.6%). In 2008, the regions with the
highest obesity prevalence were North Africa and
Middle East, Central and Southern Latin America,
Southern Sub-Saharan Africa, and high-income North
America, with prevalences ranging from 27.4% to 31.1%.
By 2008, South and Southeast Asia and Central and East
Sub-Saharan Africa still had some of the lowest preva￾lences of obesity, as did high-income Asia Pacific, with
prevalences ranging from 2.2% to 5.4%. On the other
hand, Western Sub-Saharan Africa, which had remained
a low-obesity region until 2000, experienced a relatively
large rise in BMI in the next 8 years, and hence no longer
was a region with low prevalence in 2008.
In 16 of 21 regions, the prevalence of female obesity was
greater than that of men in every year from 1980 to 2008.
In high-income Asia-Pacific, Australasia, Western Europe,
Southern Latin America, and Central Sub-Saharan Africa,
male obesity exceeded female obesity in some years,
usually by a small margin. Male and female obesity preva￾lence differed most in Southern Sub-Saharan Africa,
where 18.7% (15.6-21.5%) of men were obese vs. 36.7%
(33.0%-40.2%) of women in 2008.
The prevalence of female obesity increased the most
in some countries in Oceania, with the largest increase
in Cook Islands (16.8 percentage points per decade, 9.4-
24.1, pp > 0.99) and Tonga (16.0 percentage points, 8.8-
23.1, pp > 0.99) (Figures 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). The prevalence of
obesity increased more than 10 percentage points per
decade in 16 countries in Oceania and the Caribbean,
and in Egypt. A decline in the prevalence of obesity was
estimated for women in 10 countries: Lithuania,
Tajikistan, Estonia, Zimbabwe, Serbia, Democratic People's
Republic of Korea, Montenegro, Singapore, Ukraine, and
Romania; none were statistically distinguishable from no
trend (pp ranged from 0.50-0.68). Male obesity increased
more than 10 percentage points per decade in seven coun￾tries in Oceania, most notably in Nauru (14.5 percentage
points per decade, 7.6-22.0, pp > 0.99) and Cook Islands
(15.5 percentage points per decade, 9.9-20.7, pp > 0.99). A
decline in the prevalence of obesity was estimated for men
in seven countries: Tajikistan, Moldova, Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Afghanistan, Central African
Republic, Nepal, and Bangladesh; none were statistically
distinguishable from no trend (pp ranged from 0.41-0.75).
The regions with the largest increase in the prevalence
of female obesity were Central Latin America (8.5 per￾centage points per decade, 5.3-11.2, pp > 0.99), Oceania
(8.2 percentage points per decade, 5.2-11.1, pp > 0.99),
and Southern Latin America (8.2 percentage points per
decade, 4.1-12.0, pp > 0.99); female obesity increased in
every region (pp ranging from 0.79 in Central Asia to >
0.99 in 15 regions). The regions with the largest increase
in male obesity were North America (6.9 percentage
points per decade, 5.7-8.1, pp > 0.99) and Australasia
(5.9 percentage points per decade, 4.6-7.2, pp > 0.99),
while the regions with the smallest increases were
Central Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, both of
which had trends that were statistically indistinguishable
from zero (pp ranged from 0.43-0.66). The absolute an￾nual increase in obesity prevalence was greater during
2000 to 2008 than the 1980s or the 1990s in all 21
regions. In nine regions (Central and South Asia, Central
and Eastern Europe, Tropical Latin America, and East,
West, Central, and Southern Sub-Saharan Africa), more
Stevens et al. Population Health Metrics 2012, 10:22 Page 7 of 16

than half of the rise in obesity over the period 1980 to
2008 occurred in 2000 to 2008.
Diverging trends in obesity were observed among
high-income regions, with larger increases in Australasia
and North America and smaller increases in the high￾income Asia Pacific and Western European regions, es￾pecially for females (Figure 3). Female obesity increased
7.6 (5.8-9.3) percentage points per decade in high-income
North America and 6.8 (5.1-8.3) percentage points per
decade in Australasia, vs. 2.7 (1.4-3.9) and 1.0 (0.4-1.5)
percentage points per decade in Western Europe and
high-income Asia-Pacific, respectively. Likewise, male
obesity increased 6.9 (5.7-8.1) percentage points per
decade in high-income North America and 5.9 (4.6-7.2)
percentage points per decade in Australasia, vs. 4.0
(3.0-5.0) and 1.5 (1.1-1.9) percentage points per decade
in Western Europe and high-income Asia-Pacific, respect￾ively. Based on these trends and on 1980 levels, in 2008
the prevalence of obesity was higher in high-income North
America (31.1%, 28.9-33.3%) and Australasia (25.3%, 23.1-
27.6%), than in Western Europe (20.0%, 18.5%-21.6%)
and high-income Asia-Pacific (5.4%, 4.6-6.2%).
While overweight and obesity prevalence generally
increased worldwide, there were differences between men
and women in some regions and countries (Figures 5-9).
For example, the prevalence of female obesity increased
more than the prevalence of male obesity in 46 of 48
countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and in 35 of 37 countries
in Latin America and the Caribbean. In Central Sub￾Saharan Africa and Southern Latin America, this
resulted in women having a higher prevalence of obes￾ity in 2008 than men, in contrast to their 1980 orders.

In contrast, in Western, Central, and Eastern Europe,
and in the high-income Asia Pacific countries, the
prevalence of obesity increased more among men than
women in 41 of 47 countries.
Discussion
One in every 3 adults in the world was overweight and 1
in every 9 was obese in 2008. Beyond this global average,
at least 1 in 5 women were obese in 117 countries and
at least 1 in 5 men were obese in 73 countries. Notably,
the increase in the prevalence of obesity has accelerated
in the last decade compared to the 1980s and 1990s.
The rising obesity and overweight are clearly asso￾ciated with increases in mean BMI. However, we found
that the relationship between mean and prevalence was
not linear: BMI increase at low BMI levels results in a
smaller increase in obesity than an identical absolute in￾crease at higher BMIs (Figure 1). The relationship between
obesity and mean BMI also changed over time: in 2008,
the prevalence of obesity was greater at all mean BMIs
than it had been in earlier decades, indicating that the
population BMI distributions is likely to have become
wider over time. If recent trends in mean BMI continue
[6], the prevalence of obesity will continue to rise at the
recent alarmingly high rates.
This study is the first report of adult overweight and
obesity prevalence by country, year, and sex. The
strengths and innovations of this study include analysis
of long-term trends; large amount of high-quality mea￾sured population-based data accessed and used; the use
of a Bayesian hierarchical model for estimating mean
BMI, incorporating non-linear time trends; systematic
conversion of mean BMI to overweight and obesity
prevalence, including adjusting for age, sex, region, and
time; and systematic analysis of uncertainty. The main
limitation of our study is that data gaps remained des￾pite our extensive data seeking, especially in the 1980s
and for men through the 1990s. We did not model the
full population distribution of BMI by country, which
should be a topic for future research. Our analysis did
not consider trends in central adiposity due to a lack of
population-based data, nor did it quantify within￾country disparities by socioeconomic status or race [9-11].
Finally, we did not estimate childhood and adolescent adi￾posity. Child and adolescent overweight and obesity are
important because childhood weight gain may have larger
adverse effects than weight gain during adulthood due to
the longer exposure, and because they are predictive of fu￾ture trends in overweight and obesity in adults. Measuring
overweight and obesity in school-aged children and ado￾lescents is challenging for several reasons: first, there is an
age gap in survey data as most surveys on maternal and
child health include data up to 5 years of age and those
related to noncommunicable disease risk factors and
behaviors target adults; second, until the 2007 introduc￾tion of WHO growth standards, there was little consensus
on definitions of overweight and obesity in children aged
5 years to 19 years. This has resulted in incomparable
measures, available in the sparse published literature.
The United Nations General Assembly High-Level
Meeting on the Prevention and Control of Noncommu￾nicable Diseases in September 2011 requested that WHO
develop targets for key noncommunicable disease indica￾tors, which may include the prevalence of obesity. Data
on historical trends allows setting ambitious, yet feasible
targets [12]. Our estimates provide a consistent baseline
for such empirical targets. The tenth best performing
percentile of countries, ranked from lowest to highest
absolute increase in obesity, experienced an increase of
0.6 percentage points per decade from 1980 to 2008.
The relative change at the tenth percentile was around a
9% increase over 15 years for women and 25% for men.
We estimated nonsignificant change (at the pp=0.75 level)
in obesity prevalence in 15 countries, while the remainder
experienced a statistically significant increase in obesity.
Most of these countries maintained low levels of obesity
prevalence through food scarcity rather than effective
policy action, and thus their experience may not be the
appropriate baseline for policies that aim to halt the
rise in obesity. Therefore, given the widespread rise in
obesity, a key question is how ambitious an obesity target
should be relative to the historical experience.
Disentangling the contributions of declines in phys￾ical activity, changes in calorie consumption and com￾position, and other factors to the recent increases in
mean BMI and overweight and obesity prevalence are
currently active areas of research [13,14]. The data
presented in this paper can be used to generate and
evaluate hypotheses about these trends via ecological
analyses that explore the relationship between trends
in overweight/obesity prevalence and in their possible
causes. However, we must also carry out rigorous
intervention studies to test programs and actions that
may curb and reverse these trends [15].
Conclusions
Our systematic analysis of population-based data sources
helped unpack the “global obesity pandemic” into its
constituent trends by country, region, and sex. We
found that, although the magnitude of the rise in obesity
varies by region, country, and gender, stability in obesity
prevalence was rare. Moreover, the rise in obesity has
accelerated in the last decade. This documentation of
country trends in obesity prevalence may be used to set
targets as requested by the United Nations General
Assembly's High-Level Meeting on the Prevention and
Control of Noncommunicable Diseases.
