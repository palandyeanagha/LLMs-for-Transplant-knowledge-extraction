The origin and turnover of connective tissue cells in adult human organs, including the lung, are not well
understood. Here, studies of cells derived from human lung allografts demonstrate the presence of a multi￾potent mesenchymal cell population, which is locally resident in the human adult lung and has extended life
span in vivo. Examination of plastic-adherent cell populations in bronchoalveolar lavage samples obtained
from 76 human lung transplant recipients revealed clonal proliferation of fibroblast-like cells in 62% (106 of
172) of samples. Immunophenotyping of these isolated cells demonstrated expression of vimentin and pro￾lyl-4-hydroxylase, indicating a mesenchymal phenotype. Multiparametric flow cytometric analyses revealed
expression of cell-surface proteins, CD73, CD90, and CD105, commonly found on mesenchymal stem cells
(MSCs). Hematopoietic lineage markers CD14, CD34, and CD45 were absent. Multipotency of these cells was
demonstrated by their capacity to differentiate into adipocytes, chondrocytes, and osteocytes. Cytogenetic
analysis of cells from 7 sex-mismatched lung transplant recipients harvested up to 11 years after transplant
revealed that 97.2% ± 2.1% expressed the sex genotype ofthe donor. The presence of MSCs of donor sex identity
in lung allografts even years after transplantation provides what we believe to be the first evidence for connec￾tive tissue cell progenitors that reside locally within a postnatal, nonhematopoietic organ.
Introduction
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent progenitor cells
with the capacity to differentiate into connective tissue cells (1, 2).
Bone marrow, an enriched reservoir of MSCs, is believed to be the
main source for these precursor cells that populate other adult tis￾sues (3, 4). MSCs can be isolated from circulating blood (5), as well
as from diverse nonhematopoietic tissues such as synovium (6),
adipose tissue (7), trabecular bone (8), dermis (9), dental pulp (10),
and the lung (11).Itremains unknownwhether MSCsisolated from
these marrow-distant tissues reside and self-renew locally within
that tissue/organ system or whetherthey are recruited from the cir￾culation/bone marrow during postnatal adult life.
The lung is continuously exposed to a variety of potentially
injurious pathogens and noxious agents, necessitating cellular
turnover and renewal. Although MSCs have been detected in the
lung (11), their origin(s) remain unknown, and an evolving para￾digm predicts that mesenchymal cells participating in lung repair
derive from the bone marrow (12–14). There have been no reports
of MSCsthat have been conclusively demonstrated to be of tissue￾specific origin in any adult organ system, including the lung.
The transplanted lung is subject to a multitude of insults,
including ischemia and reperfusion, immunologic injury, and
microbial infections, triggering host tissue repair and regenerative
responses(15). Mesenchymal cell accumulation/activation and tis￾sue remodeling are important in the pathogenesis of chronic graft
failure in transplanted solid organs. In the lung, chronic graft fail￾ure manifests as airflow obstruction referred to as bronchiolitis
obliteranssyndrome (BOS) (16). The origins of mesenchymal cells
that participate in normal and abnormal repair responses in the
human adult lung remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate
the isolation of multipotent MSCsfrom the lowerrespiratory tract
of human lung transplant recipients. Additionally, studies in sex￾mismatched lung allografts were conducted to determine whether
these cells originate from the engrafted lung or from the host cir￾culation/bone marrow.
Results
Patient characteristics. Between May 2004 and December 2005, 172
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid samples from 76 lung trans￾plant recipients were collected and analyzed at the University of
Michigan Medical Center. This patient population included 42
females and 34 males with a mean age of 51 years (range, 23–64
years). Indications for transplantation included emphysema
(n = 39), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (n = 16), cystic fibrosis
(n = 10), bronchiectasis(n = 3), lymphangioleiomyomatosis(n = 2),
primary pulmonary hypertension (n = 2), sarcoidosis (n = 2), and
other diagnoses (n = 2). One hundred thirty BALs were performed
during routine surveillance to rule out acute rejection orinfection,
and 42 BALs were performed for other clinical indications such as
unexplained dyspnea or decline in lung function.
Isolation of plastic-adherent fibroblastoid cells from BAL fluid. MSCs
have been recognized to derive from single-cell suspensions of

bone marrowby the selective growth of plastic-adherentfibroblast￾like cell colonies in liquid culture medium (17). Such a colony of
adherent marrow stromal cells, each derived from a single precur￾sor cell, is termed a CFU-fibroblast (CFU-F) (18). To determine
whether MSC-like cells can be isolated from the lung, the cellular
components of BAL fluid were examined. Distinct fibroblastoid
colonies were observed at a mean time interval of 14 days (range,
7–21 days) after initial plating of BAL cells (Figure 1A). The num￾ber of CFU-Fs formed per 2 × 106 mononuclear cells plated varied
among samples (mean, 20; range, 0–74). CFU-Fs were identified
in 62% (106 of 172) of the BAL samples obtained from lung trans￾plant recipients. These CFU-Fs were expanded in culture by subse￾quent trypsinization and serial passaging (Figure 1A).
The influence of clinical variables on the ability to isolate CFU-Fs
from the BAL fluid was analyzed using generalized estimating
equations (19), a standard statistical technique for analysis of
longitudinal data (Table 1). These data indicated that neither
age, sex, indication for transplantation or BAL, culture positivity,
histological diagnosis of rejection or bronchiolitis obliterans, nor
physiological evidence for BOS predict ability to successfully iso￾late CFU-Fs. The only clinical variable that negatively predicted
ability to isolate CFU-Fs wasincreasing time from transplantation
to BAL. This was demonstrated by both univariate (odds ratio for
each additional year of time from transplant to BAL, 0.86; 95% CI,
0.77–0.96; P = 0.007) and multivariate analyses (odds ratio, 0.78;
95% CI, 0.65–0.95; P = 0.015), after adjusting for all other recipient
and BAL variables shown in Table 1.
Phenotypic characterization of BAL-derived CFU-Fs. CFU-Fs ini￾tially identified from the BAL were expanded in ex vivo cell cul￾ture without morphological evidence of cellular senescence.
Immunofluorescence studies of these BAL-derived cells demon￾strated expression of vimentin (an intermediate filament
protein) and prolyl-4-hydroxylase (an enzyme that cata￾lyzes posttranslational cross-linking of collagen), pro￾teinstypically associated with mesenchymal cells(Figure
1B). The high proliferative capacity ofthese cells was con￾firmed by staining for Ki67 protein (Figure 1B).
Immunophenotyping for surface antigens by flow
cytometry was performed on BAL-derived mesenchymal
cells to further characterize this cell population. These
cells strongly expressed CD73 (SH3/SH4), CD90 (Thy-1),
and CD105 (SH2) (Figure 2), as previously described for
bone marrow–derived MSCs (1, 20). Furthermore, these
cells were negative for the hematopoietic lineage markers
CD14, CD34, and CD45 (Figure 2). HLA typing revealed that these
cells express HLA-1, but not HLA-DR or HLA-DQ (data notshown).
Multipotential differentiation of BAL-derived mesenchymal cells. Asthe
major defining characteristic of MSCsistheir ability to differenti￾ate into multiple mesenchymal lineages, we determined the abil￾ity of BAL-derived mesenchymal cells to differentiate into specific
connective tissue cells. Mesenchymal cell lines from 15 patients
(at passages 2–6) were studied under defined culture conditionsto
induce osteocytic, adipocytic, and chondrocytic differentiation (as
described in Methods). The ability of BAL-derived mesenchymal
cells to differentiate into osteocytes was demonstrated by stain￾ing for extracellular mineralization in cells following osteogenic
stimulation (1, 10, 11) (Figure 3A, left panels). Osteocytic differen￾tiation wasseen in all 15 cell linestested and was absent in control
untreated cells. Adipocytic differentiation was demonstrated in 14
of 15 cell linesstimulated with insulin and other adipogenic stim￾uli (1, 10, 11) by accumulation of lipid-rich vacuoles that stained
positively with oil red O (Figure 3A, center panels). No oil red O
staining wasseen in the control cells. Pelleted micromasses of cells
treated with TGF-β3 (1) underwent chondrocytic differentiation,
as evidenced by the presence of the extracellular matrix proteogly￾can aggrecan in alltreated cell lines(Figure 3A,right panels). These
studiessuggest that BAL-derived mesenchymal cells are capable of
differentiating into multiple connective tissue cell lineages.
To determine whether BAL-derived mesenchymal cells contain
early uncommitted MSCs capable of differentiating into all 3
mesenchymal cell lineages (as opposed to mixtures of more com￾mitted progenitor cells),single colonieswere isolated and expanded
in culture priorto assays of multipotential differentiation. Ten cell
lines derived from individual CFU-Fs were tested; all colonies were
capable of undergoing differentiation into osteocytic and chondro￾Figure 1

hydroxylase (a collagen cross-linking enzyme), and Ki67 (a

expressing mesenchymal cells were actively proliferating.

cytic lineages, and 6 of 10 demonstrated adipocytic differentiation.
Additional molecular characterization of these differentiated cells
was performed by mRNA expression analysis of lineage-specific
markers. Upregulated expression of PPARγ2 and adipocyte fatty
acid binding protein 2 (aP2) (adipogenic transcription factors),
types II and IX collagen (chondrocytic markers), and osteopontin
(osteocytic marker) was demonstrated under their
respective differentiation-inducing conditions by
RT-PCR (Figure 3B). Quantification of upregulated
expression for osteopontin, PPARγ, and aggrecan,
indicative of osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondro￾genic differentiation, respectively, was demonstrated
by real-time PCR (Figure 3C). Similarly, fatty acid
binding protein 4, adipocyte (FABP4) and alkaline
phosphatase expression levels were increased
significantly in response to adipogenic and
osteogenic differentiation media,respectively
(data not shown). Baseline expression of
these genes in BAL-derived MSCs was com￾pared with that in bone marrow–derived
MSCs by real-time PCR. No significant dif￾ference in baseline expression of adipocytic
markers (PPARγ, FABP4), chondrocytic
markers (aggrecan), or alkaline phosphatase
was seen between BAL- and bone marrow–
derived MSCs. However, 167-fold greater
expression of osteopontin was noted in the
bone marrow–derived MSCs compared with
BAL-derived MSCs (P = 0.007).

Sex chromosome analyses by FISH of BAL￾derived MSCs. MSCs isolated from nonhe￾matopoietic tissues may either derive from
the bone marrow/circulation or reside
locally within the tissue/organ. To distin￾guish the tissue of origin of these BAL￾derived MSCs, the recipient versus donor
sex chromosome status of cells from 7 sex￾mismatched transplant recipients wasstud￾ied. Five hundred cells from each patient
were analyzed at passage 3 by FISH for X
(red) and Y (green) chromosomes (Figure 4;

lung transplanted into a male recipient [bottom panel]). Char￾acteristics and results of the scoring of 500 cells in each of the

the BAL fluid of these patients exhibited the XY chromosomal
status of the donor. No cells (0 of 500) of recipient origin were
noted in 5 of 7 cases. In the other 2 cases, only 1 of 500 and 8
of 500 cells studied were of recipient origin. This indicates that
MSCs isolated from BAL fluid of lung allografts are locally resi￾dent within the adult lung and not derived from an extrapulmo￾nary or bone marrow MSC population.
To determine the effect of time fol￾lowing transplantation on donor versus
recipient origin of MSCs, sex chromo￾some assignment data were stratified
according to time out from the trans￾plantation procedure. Cells were
obtained forstudy from patients at early
(≤3 months in patients 1–3) and late
(3.1, 3.9, 7.4, and 11.5 years in patients
4, 5, 6, and 7, respectively; Table 2) time
points after lung transplantation. In
both these cohorts of patients, BAL￾derived MSCs consistently demonstrat￾ed the donor sex genotype. These data
illustrate the presence of donor-derived
MSCs long after lung transplantation,
suggesting their longevity or capacity
forself-renewal in vivo.
Cytokine/chemokine gene expression pro￾file of lung-resident MSCs versus bone mar￾row–derived MSCs. The best-character￾ized source of MSCs in humans is the
bone marrow (1, 18, 20). To determine
whether cytokine/chemokine gene
expression profiles in MSCs resident
in the lung are distinct from those
derived from the bone marrow,we com￾pared the transcriptome of MSCs from
these sources by Affymetrix analysis.
The majority of genes previously dem￾onstrated to be highly upregulated
in MSCs (21–23) were found to be
expressed to a similar degree in both
BAL- and bone marrow–derived MSCs
(Supplemental Table 1, genes 1–19;sup￾plemental material available onlinewith
this article; doi:10.1172/JCI29713DS1).
However, several chemokines (IL-8,
CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL6), genes associ￾atedwith angiogenesis(encoding IL-1α,
IL-8, VEGF, FGF2, and TGF-β2), and
genes associated with hematopoiesis
(encoding leukemia inhibitory factor,
CSF1-macrophage, CSF2 granulo￾cyte-macrophage, and IL-6) were more
highly expressed in bone marrow–
derived MSCs than BAL-derived MSCs.
Affymetrix data also confirmed real￾time PCR data indicating increased
expression of osteopontin, a marker for
osteogenesis and an important factor
for hematopoiesis, in bone marrow–
derived MSCs compared with BAL￾derived MSCs. The data suggest that MSCs derived from these dif￾ferent tissue environments reflect distinct gene expression profiles
consistent with their origin and functional roles.

in treated cells (bottom left). This was absent in control untreated cells (top left). Accumulation of 
lipid droplets (indicating adipocytic differentiation) was demonstrated by staining with oil red O in 
treated cells (bottom center; untreated control is shown in top center). Immunofluorescence stain￾ing with anti-human aggrecan polyclonal antibody demonstrates the presence of the extracellular

and type IX collagen (Coll. type II and IX; indicative of chondrogenic activity), and osteopontin 
(indicative of osteogenic activity) was upregulated in treated cells. Lanes demonstrate RNA isolated

5 of 15 samples processed in a manner identical to that described
for lung transplant recipients. The ability of mesenchymal cells
obtained from normal subjects to undergo multilineage differen￾tiation in response to various differentiation-inducing conditions
was tested in 3 of these cell lines. Microscopy revealed the presence
of fat globules and calcium accumulation in response to adipocytic
and osteocytic differentiation conditions, respectively; in addition
quantitative real-time PCR assays revealed a 12-fold increase in
FABP4 activity (P = 0.003; adipocytic differentiation) and a 9-fold
increase in alkaline phosphatase activity (P = 0.02; osteocytic differ￾entiation). Each of the BAL-derived mesenchymal cells from these
healthy subjects stained positively for chondrocytic markers in
response to TGF-β3, similar to what was observed in samples from
lung transplant recipients (Figure 3A). These data demonstrate
that mesenchymal cells with multilineage differentiation potential
can be isolated from BAL fluid obtained from human lungs in the
absence of an allogeneic stimulus. However, our preliminary results
suggest that the ability to recover these cells in normal volunteers
may be lower than thatseen in the lung transplant population.
Discussion
In this study, we demonstrate the ability to isolate fibroblast-like
cellsfrom the lower respiratory tract of lung transplant recipients
with a minimally invasive procedure commonly used in clinical
practice, bronchoscopy with BAL. BAL-derived mesenchymal cells
exhibited several characteristics typical of classical bone marrow–
derived MSCs (1, 18, 20). First, they can be isolated by adherence
purification on tissue culture plastic and form distinct CFU-Fs in
cell culture; second, these cells express surface proteins typically
associated with MSCs but do not express hematopoietic stem cell
markers; third, individual colonies possess multipotent differ￾entiation capacity and give rise to adipocytes, chondrocytes, and
osteocytes. Importantly, cytogenetic analyses in sex-mismatched
recipients demonstrated that these BAL-derived MSCs were of
donor sex chromosome karyotype, even when analyzed a num￾ber of years after lung transplantation. This is the first study to
our knowledge to demonstrate that lung tissue–specific MSCs are
present in the human adult lung. The long-term survival of these
cells — for more than a decade in transplanted lung allografts
— supports the concept of the presence of organ-specific MSC
populations that likely serve as a reservoir for connective tissue
cells in nonhematopoietic organ systems.
There are a growing number of reports of putative MSC-like
cells isolated from various nonhematopoietic organs, includ￾ing the lung (6–11). Importantly, however, no human or animal
studies have definitively determined whether these cells are tissue

resident or whether they require continual replenishment from
the bone marrow. Two features of our current study allow us to
conclude that the BAL-derived MSC population described herein
resideslocally within the human adult human lung: (a) the ability
to study these cells from sex-mismatched lung transplant recipi￾ents; and (b) the ability to isolate (disaggregated) cells in ex vivo
tissue culture at the single-cell level and analyze sex chromosome
status in a quantitative manner. Our studies show that the vast
majority of lung-derived MSCs are donor derived and, hence, resi￾dent in the lung at least from the time that the allograft was first
transplanted. In 5 of 7 sex-mismatched lung transplants, no cells
with the sex genotype of the recipient were seen. Although poly￾ploidy suggestive of fusion events was noted in 4 of these cases,
the rate of polyploidy was relatively low, ranging from 1.2% to
5.6%. Interestingly, in almost all cases where such fusion events
were noted, they occurred between 2 donor cells, and not between
donor and recipient cells. Of a total of 3,500 cells analyzed (500
cells in each sex-mismatched patient), only 8 cells (0.2%) with the
same sex chromosome as that of the host were identified, sug￾gesting that extrapulmonary or bone marrow contribution to this
MSC-like cell population is extremely limited. It isintriguing that
7 of these 8 cells were found in the patient with the longest inter￾val from lung transplantation (11.5 years); however, the patient
with the next-longest interval from transplantation (7.2 years)
was found to have no cells of host or recipient origin. Studies in
larger numbers of long-surviving lung transplant recipients are
needed to definitively assess the potential replacement of tissue￾resident MSC-like cells that might occur over more extended time
periods (>7 years).
Previous studies demonstrating engraftment of nonhemato￾poietic tissues by hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells in animal
models and human studies in allogeneic sex-mismatched organ
transplantations have relied on in situ labeling and immuno￾phenotyping (24, 25). A limitation of these studies has been the
inability to exclude recipient bone marrow–derived circulating
cells located in close proximity to structural tissue-specific cells,
or cell fusion events (24). A major advantage of the experimental
approach used in our studies is that we were able to study these
cells at the single-cell level; therefore, potential confounding fac￾tors such as adjacent/overlying bone marrow–derived or circulat￾ing immune cells were avoided. An inherent disadvantage of this
approach, however, is that the in situ microenvironmental niche
of these MSCs within the lung is currently not known. However,
the derivation of allograft-specific MSCs definitively supportsthe
presence of a lung-resident MSC population. This lung-resident
MSC population is likely to lay dormant in the uninjured adult
lung and become mobilized during states of lung repair/regenera￾tion. In support of this concept, time from transplantation was
predictive ofwhether MSC recovery/growth as assessed by BALwas
successful (1.27 ± 2.01 years with recovery versus 2.3 ± 3.56 years
with no recovery; P = 0.007). The degree of severity of injury to the
airway-alveolar epithelium islikely to have been highest during the
immediate posttransplantation period, thus resulting in higher
rates of MSC isolation. We have previously reported the ability to
isolate alveolar mesenchymal cells from patients with acute lung
injury with high rates of recovery, although the multipotential
nature and origin(s) of these cells have not been determined (26).
Furthermore, in the current study, although MSCs could be iso￾lated from BAL samples from normal healthy volunteers, the rate
of successful isolation was relatively low.
The donor derivation of MSCs from allografts of longer-sur￾viving lung transplant recipients provides another important
insight into mechanisms of connective tissue repair in the adult
lung. In 4 of our sex-mismatched lung transplant recipients, sev￾eral years (i.e., 3.1–11.5) transpired between the time of original
lung transplantation and isolation of BAL-derived MSCs. Each of
these patients had BOS,suggesting that their grafts had been sub￾jected to immunological, and possibly nonimmunological, injury.
Despite this chronic injury, MSCs isolated from these grafts were
predominantly donor in origin. This suggests that these MSCs
survive for long intervals within the lung or, more likely, that they
possessself-renewal capacity. It is not known whetherthese cellsin
the postnatal human adult lung are present from the time of birth.
In animal studies, a population of resident cells (side population
cells; CD45–CD31–), potentially representing smooth muscle pre￾cursors, has been identified in murine embryonic lung (27).
Bone marrow–derived MSCs play an important role in support￾ing hematopoiesis by providing stromal support and by secre￾tion of cytokines and growth factors (28, 29). One would predict
that MSCs in different tissue microenvironments are phenotypi￾cally distinct to support organ-specific functions. In our analyses,
gene expression profiling demonstrated significantly decreased
expression in lung-derived MSCs of several factors implicated in
hematopoiesis. Similarly, baseline expression of osteopontin, a
markerfor osteogenesis and an importantfactorin hematopoiesis,
wassignificantly higher in bone marrow–derived MSCsthan BAL￾derived MSCs. These data support the presence of a unique lung￾resident MSC population.
The study of stem/precursor cells in the lung is an area of
active research (30). Lung-specific epithelial cell stem/progenitor
cells are known to be present along the respiratory tree (31–33),
although bona fide MSCs resident in the lung have not been pre￾viously identified, to our knowledge, in humans. There is signifi￾cant interest in the role of bone marrow–derived mesenchymal
precursor cells, both MSCs (34) and a CD34+collagen 1+ popula￾tion termed fibrocytes (14, 35, 36), in murine models of lung injury.
However, the role of these bone marrow–derived cells in lung
injury/repair, particularly in humans, is unclear (37). It is possible
that specific bone marrow–derived populations such as circulat￾ing fibrocytes require specific microenvironmental signals and
may notsurvive/grow in the ex vivo cell culture conditions used in
our studies; thus, their participation, either directly or indirectly
(e.g., by release of soluble factors), in reparative processes in lung
transplantation cannot be excluded.
In summary, this study demonstrates, for the first time to our
knowledge, the isolation and characterization of a nonhematopoi￾etic MSC population from the lower respiratory tract of human
lung transplant recipients. The ability to isolate these donor￾derived cells as long as 11.5 years after transplantation suggests
the existence of a population of MSCsthatreside and self-renew in
the adult lung — a paradigm that might hold true for other organ
systems as well. Identification and characterization of these MSCs
could represent the firststep to understanding endogenous mech￾anisms of adaptive and maladaptive lung injury repair.
Methods
Patients and samples. Lung transplant recipients undergoing bronchoscopy
at the University of Michigan were eligible for enrollment in the study.
The study was approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Review
Board, and informed consent was obtained prior to participation in the

study. Bronchoscopy and BAL with and without transbronchial biopsies
using standard techniques were performed on all enrolled patients. BAL
fluid was allocated for clinical tests, including bacterial, fungal, and viral
cultures, and an additional 10–50 ml of the BAL fluid was immediately
placed on ice and processed forisolation of mesenchymal cells. Transbron￾chial biopsies were examined forthe presence of acute rejection or bronchi￾olitis obliterans according to established criteria (38). BOS was defined by
physiological testing according to the International Society of Heart and
Lung Transplantation guidelines (39).
Isolation and culture of cells from BAL fluid. Recovered BAL fluid was ini￾tially filtered through sterile gauze to remove noncellular particulate
material and mucus. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 g for 5
minutes and seeded at a density of 2 × 106 mononuclear cells per 100-mm
cell culture dish. The cells were maintained in medium consisting of
high-glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
(Invitrogen), 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 0.5% fun￾gizone (Invitrogen) and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 / 95% air. Medium
was changed first after 24 hours and then every 3 days. Single separated
fibroblastoid coloniestermed CFU-Fs were identified at a mean interval of
14 days(range, 7–21 days) after initial plating. To study mesenchymal cells
obtained from an individual patient, all colonies growing in a 100-cc plate
were trypsinized and passed into a T-75 flask. A homogeneous population
of mesenchymal cells was obtained from individual patients by second pas￾sage. To study clonally derived cell populations, individual CFU-Fs were
isolated with a sterile pipette and transferred to a T-25 flask. For stain￾ing and enumeration of CFU-Fs, adherent CFU-F colonies were fixed with
methanol and stained with Wright-Giemsa stain (Fisher Scientific).
Immunofluorescence labeling. Immunofluorescence labeling was per￾formed on 5 cell lines generated from individual patients at passages 2–6
using mouse mAbs against Ki67 (Novus Biologicals), prolyl-4-hydroxylase
(Dako), and vimentin (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were visualized and photo￾graphed using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope.
Multiparameter flow cytometric analyses (FACS).Cell-surface antigenphenotyp￾ingwas performed on cell lines(n = 6–11) generated from individual patients
at passage 3–5 using FITC- or PE-conjugated antibodies againstCD34,CD45,
CD14, CD73, CD90, and CD105 (all from SouthernBiotech). FITC-labeled
antibodies against HLA class I antigen and HLA-DQ and PE-labeled anti￾body against HLA-DR were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Briefly, cells were
trypsinized and aliquoted at a concentration of 0.5 × 106 cells/ml and stained
for 30 minuteswith either conjugated specific antibodies orisotype-matched
control mouse IgGs at recommended concentrations. Labeled cells were
washed twice, resuspended in FACS buffer, and analyzed on a FACSCalibur
E5060 flow cytometer using FACSComp version 4.2 software (BD).
Assays for adipogenic, chondrogenic, and osteogenic differentiation. Multilin￾eage differentiation to adipocyte, chondrocyte, and osteocyte lineages
was tested in 15 different cell lines generated from individual patients
at varying passage numbers (passages 2–6). Furthermore, to demonstrate
the ability of cells derived from single cells to differentiate into multiple
lineages, individual CFU-Fs were isolated and cultured, and differentia￾tion of expanded cells from individual CFU-Fs (n = 10) was studied at the
fourth passage. Induction conditions used were based on previous litera￾ture in the MSC field (1, 10, 11). Briefly, for adipogenic differentiation,
confluent cell cultures in a 24-well plate were treated with adipogenic
differentiation medium containing 0.5 mM isobutylmethylxanthine,
200 μM indomethacin, 10–6 M dexamethasone, and 10 μg/ml of insulin in
high-glucose DMEM (Invitrogen) with 10% FBS (0.5 ml/well). At 3 weeks
cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde (Fisher Scientific) and incubated
with fresh oil red O for 1 hour at room temperature; lipid droplets were
visualized and photographed. Osteogenic differentiation was induced by
incubating the cells with 10–8M dexamethasone, 0.2 mM ascorbate phos￾phate, and 10 mM β-glycerophosphate in α-MEM (Invitrogen) with 10%
FBS. After 21 days, cells were fixed and incubated with freshly made 2%
alizarin red stain, pH 4.2, for 3 minutes. For chondrogenic differentiation,
cells were cultured as a pelleted micromass in the presence of TGF-β3, as
described by Pittenger et al. (1). After 4 weeks, pellets were embedded en
bloc in Tissue Freezing Medium (TBS) in a cryomold in liquid nitrogen,
and 6-μM frozen sections were obtained. Immunohistochemical stain￾ing for the extracellular matrix proteoglycan aggrecan using anti-human
aggrecan polyclonal antibody (1 μg/100 μl; R&D Systems) was performed
to demonstrate chondrocyte differentiation. All reagents, unless other￾wise specified, were from Sigma-Aldrich.
RNA isolation and analysis. Total RNA wasisolated from mesenchymal cells
using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) as per the manufacturer’s instruc￾tions.RT-PCR reactionwas performed for expression of PPARγ2, aP2,type II
collagen, type IX collagen, and osteopontin. β2-Microglobulin was used as
a control. Reverse transcription and PCR were carried out using a QIAGEN
1-step RT-PCR kit as per the manufacturer’s protocol. The PCR reactions
were carried out for 40 cycles with the primersequences as described by Pit￾tenger et al. (1). The reaction products were resolved by electrophoresis on a
1.0% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide.
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis was performed on an ABI Prism
7000 SDS (Applied Biosystems) using the TaqMan PCR Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems). The TaqMan real-time PCR primers were pur￾chased from Applied Biosystems and included Hs00234592_m1 for
PPAR-γ, Hs00609791_m1 for FABP4, Hs00758162_m1 for ALPL (alkaline
phosphatase liver/bone/kidney), Hs00167093_m1 for SPP1 (secreted phos￾phoprotein 1, osteopontin), and Hs00202971_m1 for AGC1 (aggrecan 1).
ForAffymetrix analysis, MSCswere isolated from the normal human bone
marrow aspirate as previously described (40) under a protocol approved by
the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board. Total RNA was pre￾pared from 3 sets each of bone marrow– and BAL-derived MSCs cultured
under similar conditions at passage 3. Affymetrix array hybridization and
scanningwere performed by the UMCCC Affymetrix and cDNA Microarray
Core Facility at the University of Michigan, using Human U133 Plus 2.0
chips. Expression values for each gene were calculated using a robust mul￾tiarray average algorithm and expressed as log2-transformed data. Two￾tailed Student’sttest was used to determine differential expression of genes
between lung-derived and bone marrow–derived MSCs.
FISH analysis of BAL-derived cells. Cultured cells from 7 patients were
trypsinized, resuspended in AmnioMax culture medium and supplement
(Invitrogen), and subcultured on 4 coverslips for 1–3 days to obtain actively
dividing cells for cytogenetic analysis. Next, cells were harvested using a
TecanRSP 500Robotic Harvesterfollowing a modified harvesting technique
(41). CEP X Spectrum Orange and Y Spectrum Green DNA probes (Vysis)
were hybridized to the cultured cells according to the manufacturer’sinstruc￾tions. These probes hybridize to the α satellite sequencesin the centromeric
region of the X chromosome and the Yq12 satellite III DNA region of the
Y chromosome. A total of 500 interphase cells was scored for each of the 7
sex-mismatched cell lines studied; cells were also analyzed in metaphase for
probe confirmation. The analysiswas performed by a cytogeneticistwhowas
blinded to donor and recipient sex. Normal male and female control slides
were included in the FISH analysisto confirm validity of the probes.
Statistics. Generalized estimating equations (19) were used to model the
potentially correlated binary outcomes of ability or inability to identify
CFU-Fs in BAL samples. This standard statistical method for analyses of
longitudinal data was used because multiple BAL samples were obtained
from some patients, and this method allowed us to account for the depen￾dence between sample outcomes on a given patient. Both univariate and
multivariate analysis adjusting for potential confounders were studied.
P values of less than 0.05 were considered significant.
