Abstract
Acute pyelonephritis (APN), which is mainly caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), is the most common bacterial
complication in renal transplant recipients receiving immunosuppressive treatment. However, it remains unclear how
immunosuppressive drugs, such as the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine A (CsA), decrease renal resistance to UPEC. Here,
we investigated the effects of CsA in host defense against UPEC in an experimental model of APN. We show that CsA￾treated mice exhibit impaired production of the chemoattractant chemokines CXCL2 and CXCL1, decreased intrarenal
recruitment of neutrophils, and greater susceptibility to UPEC than vehicle-treated mice. Strikingly, renal expression of Toll￾like receptor 4 (Tlr4) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1 (Nod1), neutrophil migration capacity, and
phagocytic killing of E. coli were significantly reduced in CsA-treated mice. CsA inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced,
Tlr4-mediated production of CXCL2 by epithelial collecting duct cells. In addition, CsA markedly inhibited Nod1 expression
in neutrophils, macrophages, and renal dendritic cells. CsA, acting through inhibition of the nuclear factor of activated T￾cells (NFATs), also markedly downregulated Nod1 in neutrophils and macrophages. Silencing the NFATc1 isoform mRNA,
similar to CsA, downregulated Nod1 expression in macrophages, and administration of the 11R-VIVIT peptide inhibitor of
NFATs to mice also reduced neutrophil bacterial phagocytosis and renal resistance to UPEC. Conversely, synthetic Nod1
stimulating agonists given to CsA-treated mice significantly increased renal resistance to UPEC. Renal transplant recipients
receiving CsA exhibited similar decrease in NOD1 expression and neutrophil phagocytosis of E. coli. The findings suggest
that such mechanism of NFATc1-dependent inhibition of Nod1-mediated innate immune response together with the
decrease in Tlr4-mediated production of chemoattractant chemokines caused by CsA may contribute to sensitizing kidney
grafts to APN.

Introduction
Urinary tract infection (UTI) often complicated by acute
pyelonephritis (APN), which is mainly caused by uropathogenic
Escherichia coli (UPEC), is the most frequent infectious complication
following renal transplantation [1,2]. Despite improvement of the
surgical procedures and the use of post-operative antibiotic
prophylaxis, the rates of post-graft APN still remain higher than
in the normal population [2], and late UTI occurring after more
than 6 months after transplantation are associated with increased
risk of death, and post-graft APN may also compromise long-term
graft outcome [3,4]. Although many factors including age, sex,
and co-morbidity conditions play a role in the susceptibility to
infection, long-term immunosuppressive therapy used to prevent

episodes of acute graft rejection obviously increases the risk of
bacterial, viral or fungal infections in the context of transplantation
[5,6].
Calcineurin inhibitors, such as Cyclosporine A (CsA), are almost
incontrovertible drugs widely used to prevent renal graft rejection.
Their main function is to inhibit the phosphatase activity of
calcineurin, which regulates the nuclear translocation of the
nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFATs) transcription factor [7].
Impaired activation of NFATs then prevents the transcription of
cytokine genes, including IL-2, in activated T cells [8]. However,
the mechanism(s) by which CsA could alter the innate immune
system, and thereby decrease renal host defenses against ascending
UPEC remain largely unknown.
Early recognition of bacterial motifs by a number of pattern
recognition receptors, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and
(Nod)-like receptors (NLRs), is essential for the removal of
bacterial pathogens [9]. UPEC colonizing the urinary tract are
recognized by several TLRs, including TLR2, 4, 5, and 11 [10].
Studies using experimental murine models of ascending UTI have
demonstrated that Tlr4, which senses lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
from Gram-negative bacteria [10], and also Tlr11, that is
expressed in murine bladder epithelial cells and RTECs [11],
regulate susceptibility to UTIs in mice. TLRs play key roles in
activating the transcription factor NF-kB and the mitogen￾activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling pathways leading to
the production of chemoattractant cytokines and subsequent
recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages for
efficient clearance of the bacteria. Nod1 and Nod2 also promote
the activation of NF-kB and MAPKs through the recruitment of
the kinase RIP-2 (also known as RIP2K or RICK), which is a
member of the caspase activation and recruitment domain
(CARD) protein family [12,13]. Nod1 recognizes muramyl
tripeptide (M-TriDAP), a degradation product of peptidoglycan
(PGN) containing DAP which is present in most Gram-negative
bacteria and some Gram-positive bacteria [14,15], while Nod2
recognizes muramyl dipeptide (MDP), a motif common to PGNs
from all classes of bacteria [15]. Nod2 is mainly expressed in
monocytes and macrophages, and mutations of NOD2 are
associated with Crohn’s disease, an inflammatory bowel disease
mainly driven by T cells [16,17]. The functions of Nod1, which is
more ubiquitously expressed, differ somewhat from those of Nod2.
Recent studies have demonstrated that Nod1 plays a key role in
the migration of neutrophils into the intestine and liver [18], and
in activating phagocytic mechanisms of bacterial killing [19,20].
The fact that altered leukocyte functions and decreased capacity
for bacterial phagocytosis are the most common abnormalities in
the immune status of renal transplant recipients [21,22], led us to
investigate the possibility that CsA alters the Nod1-mediated
neutrophil functions and bacterial phagocytic killing of UPEC.
In the present study, we used an experimental mouse model of
ascending UTI and show that the administration of CsA to wild￾type (WT) mice decreases renal resistance to UPEC infection. CsA
impaired Tlr4-mediated activation and subsequent production of
chemoattractant chemokines in the epithelial collecting duct cells,
to which UPEC bind preferentially during their retrograde ascent
along the urinary tract system [23]. In addition, CsA, through its
inhibitory action on NFATs, also markedly inhibited the
functional expression of Nod1 in phagocytic cells, including
neutrophil migration capacity and phagocytic killing of UPEC.
Similar to CsA-treated WT mice, Nod12/2 mice exhibited greater
susceptibility to UPEC than their WT counterparts. Using 11R￾VIVIT, a synthetic peptide inhibitor of NFATs [24], we also
demonstrate in vitro and in vivo the relevance of the regulatory role
of the NFATc1 isoform in controlling the Nod1-mediated renal
susceptibility to UPEC. We also report the functional down￾expression of human NOD1 and decreased phagocytic capacity of
E. coli in leukocytes from renal transplant recipients treated with
CsA. The combined inhibitory effects of CsA on Tlr4-mediated
chemokine production and Nod1-mediated migration of neutro￾phils and bacterial phagocytic capacities, which contribute to
decrease renal antibacterial defenses in mice, may explain, at least
in part, the susceptibility of CsA-treated renal transplant recipients
to bacterial infections.
Results
CsA increases susceptibility to renal retrograde infection
by UPEC
WT mice treated with CsA (15 mg/kg) or its vehicle for 5 days
were then infected by transurethral inoculation with the UPEC
HT7 strain isolated from the urine of a woman with acute
pyelonephritis [4,25], to test whether CsA affected renal antibac￾terial defenses. 24 h after the inoculation of live UPEC, the
bacterial burden and E. coli positive immunostaining were greater
in CsA-treated mice than vehicle-treated mice (Figure 1A and B).
As a control, we checked that CsA did not modify the growth rate
of UPEC (not shown), thus excluding any direct effect of the
calcineurin inhibitor on the bacteria. CsA also increased renal
bacterial loads in kidneys from Rag22/2 mice, which lack mature
lymphocytes, to almost the same extent as in WT kidneys
(Figure 1A), suggesting that CsA promotes UPEC infection
independently of its inhibitory effect on the adaptive immune
system. The amount of secreted chemokines MIP-2/CXCL2 and
KC/CXCL1, which play key roles in the chemoattraction of
neutrophils during experimental UTI [23,26–28], was also
significantly lower in kidneys from CsA-treated mice than
vehicle-treated mice (Figure 1C). Fewer Ly-6G+ neutrophils were
detected in the kidney medulla and in the urinary space in the
Author Summary
Patients who have received a kidney graft are treated with
immunosuppressive drugs, such as the cyclosporine A
(CsA). Transplanted patients under CsA are prone to
bacterial infections. In this study, we used an experimental
mouse model of kidney infection with Escherichia coli (E.
coli) bacteria to study the effect of CsA. We show that CsA
treatment of mice reduced their renal defense against E.
coli. We found that CsA, in addition to its inhibitory action
on the TLR4-mediated production of chemoattractant
chemokines, also inhibited the expression of nucleotide￾binding oligomerization domain 1 (Nod1), an intracellular
receptor involved in the innate immune response against
bacteria, in phagocytic cells. CsA acts by inhibiting the
functions of the transcription factor NFAT. We show that
NFAT is required for the proper expression of Nod1. Since
Nod1 has already been reported to be involved in the
phagocytic functions of polymorphonuclear neutrophils,
we looked for and found a severe defect in neutrophil
bacterial killing associated with reduced expression of
Nod1 in both mice and patients treated by CsA.
Interestingly, when mice treated with CsA are given
synthetic molecules known to bind Nod1, this permitted
the restoration of the Nod1 expression and renal defenses.
This paper describes a novel mechanism which may
explain, at least in part, why transplant patients receiving
CsA have increased susceptibility to bacterial infection,
and also provides a potential therapeutic strategy to
restore renal antibacterial defenses.

CsA-treated mice than in untreated mice (Figure 1D). Quantifi￾cation of neutrophils assessed by measuring myeloperoxidase
(MPO) activity also revealed significant lower MPO activity in the
24 h post-infected kidney homogenates from CsA-treated mice
than vehicle-treated mice (Figure 1E).
CsA impairs the migration of neutrophils and phagocytic
killing of UPEC
Flow cytometry (FACS) analysis revealed that the CD45+
leukocyte population detected in the 24 h post-infected kidneys
was essentially composed of F4/80+ CD11bLO Gr12/LO MHC-II+
CD11c+ renal dendritic cells (DCs), which have been shown to
form a contiguous network in the renal tubulointerstitium [29],
F4/802 CD11b+ Gr1HI MHC-II2 CD11c2 neutrophils, and to a
lesser extent F4/80+ CD11b+ Gr1INT MHC-II2 CD11c2
inflammatory monocytes/macrophages. FACS analysis revealed
a significant decrease in the proportion of neutrophils over the
total CD45+ renal cell population detected in the 24 h post￾infected kidneys from CsA-treated mice compared to vehicle￾treated mice kidneys (Figure S1 and Figure 2A and B). In contrast,
CsA only slightly, and non-significantly reduced the number of
monocytes/macrophages or DCs present in the 24 h post-infected
kidneys (Figure S1). This suggests that CsA preferentially impairs
the migration capacity of neutrophils in the UPEC-infected
kidneys. In vitro experiments using the Boyden chamber method
also revealed that the migration capacity of neutrophils isolated
from the blood of the 5-day CsA-treated mice and stimulated by
the neutrophil activating agent N-formyl-methionyl leucyl-phe￾nylalanine (fMLP) or by CXCL2 was significantly decreased
compared to that of neutrophils from vehicle-treated WT mice
(Figure S2A and B). CsA also altered the bacterial phagocytic
killing capacity by neutrophils. In contrast to neutrophil-enriched
peritoneal cells (NPCs) isolated from vehicle-treated mice, NPCs
collected from CsA-treated mice exhibited significantly lower ex
vivo capacity to internalize Texas red-coupled E. coli and kill
serum-opsonized E. coli (Figure 2C and D).
Nod12/2 neutrophils were shown to exhibit deficient capacity of
bacterial phagocytic killing and lower migration capacity than WT
neutrophils [20,30]. Given that neutrophil migration and their
phagocytic killing capacities were markedly reduced in CsA-treated
mice, we tested whether CsA directly alters intrarenal expression of
Nod1. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that the levels of Nod1
mRNA expression and, to a lesser extent those of Tlr4, but not of
Nod2, were markedly decreased in the 24 h post-infected CsA￾treated mice kidneys compared to those of the infected vehicle￾treated mice (Figure 2E). In accordance with these findings, the
amount of the immunodetected Nod2 protein remained equivalent
in the infected kidneys from CsA-and vehicle-treated mice, whereas
the amounts of Nod1 and Tlr4 proteins were ,50% and ,30%,
respectively, lower in the infected kidneys from CsA-treated mice
than in those from their vehicle-treated counterparts (Figure 2F).
Despite the decrease in Nod1 expression, the level of phosphory￾lated over total RIP-2, which is involved in the control of Nod￾mediated NF-kB activation [12], was similar in the 24 h post￾infected kidneys from CsA-treated mice and vehicle-treated mice
(not shown). Collectively, these findings suggest that, in addition to
an inhibitory effect on Tlr4 mRNA and protein expression, CsA
impairs the recruitment and functions of neutrophils in the inflamed
kidneys by a mechanism possibly linked to downregulation of Nod1
expression.

Nod1 is involved in host renal defenses against UPEC
We next investigated the consequence of Nod1 deficiency in
host renal bacterial defenses. The renal bacterial burden and the
number of immunodetected UPEC were significantly greater in
the kidneys of Nod12/2 mice than in those of WT, 24 h after the
inoculation of UPEC (Figure 3A and B). Less Ly-6G+ neutrophils
were detected in the urinary space from post-infected Nod12/2
mice than from post-infected WT or Nod22/2 mice (Figure 3C),
and, like in UPEC-infected CsA-treated mice, the MPO activity
also remained significantly lower in the post-infected Nod12/2
than in post-infected WT or Nod22/2 kidneys (Figure 3D). FACS
also showed that the proportion of polymorphonuclear neutrophils
infiltrating the 24 h post-infected Nod12/2 mice kidneys was lower
than in the WT kidneys (Figure 3E and F). In accordance with the
findings of Dharancy et al. [30], in vitro experiments using a Boyden
chamber revealed that the migration capacity of neutrophils
isolated from naive Nod12/2 mice and activated by fMLP (or with
CXCL2, not shown) was significantly lower than that of WT
neutrophils (Figure S2C and D). These findings also suggested that
Nod1 is implicated in the migration capacity of neutrophils.
Consistently with a role for Nod1 in the bacterial phagocytic
killing capacity of neutrophils [20] NPCs collected from Nod12/2
mice, but not those isolated from WT or Nod22/2 mice, were
unable to internalize Texas red-coupled E. coli (Figure S3A and B).
A significant reduction in the killing of serum-opsonized UPEC
was also observed in Nod12/2 neutrophils compared to WT or
Nod22/2 neutrophils (Figure S3C). We then analyzed the effects of
CsA on the renal susceptibility of Nod12/2 mice to UPEC.
Administration of CsA slightly, but not significantly, increased the
renal bacterial loads in kidneys from Nod12/2 mice compared to
those from untreated Nod12/2 mice (Figure 3G), further
suggesting that CsA impairs Nod1-mediated antibacterial defenses
to UPEC.
CsA differently alters TLR4- and Nod-mediated signaling
in renal tubule cells and neutrophils, macrophages, or
renal dendritic cells activated by UPEC
Previous studies had demonstrated that bladder epithelial cells
and renal epithelial tubule cells are actively involved, together with
bone marrow-derived cells, in the chemoattraction of neutrophils
to the site of inflammation in experimental models of ascending
UTI [31,32]. We also showed that UPEC preferentially binds to
the apical side of epithelial cells constituting the terminal collecting
duct (Figure 4A) [33]. Activation of TLR4 signaling in the urinary
tract system infected by UPEC plays a key role in this process
[23,34]. Because renal tubule cells also express the Nod1 and
Nod2 receptors, that can be activated in inflamed kidneys [35,36],
experiments were carried out to analyze the effects of CsA on both
Tlr4, and Nod1 or Nod2 signaling in renal tubule cells and bone
marrow-derived cells activated by LPS, Nod ligands or UPEC. We
checked that the renal medullary collecting duct (MCD) cells did
express Tlr4, Nod1, and Nod2 mRNAs (Figure 4B). LPS, and to a
much lesser extent the Nod1 agonist FK156 and the Nod2 agonist
MDP, stimulate the production of CXCL2 in cultured WT MCD
cells (Figure 4C). CsA inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the
Tlr4 mRNA and protein expressions without altering Nod1 and
Nod2 expressions (Figure 4D and E). We then tested whether
100 nM (corresponding to 120 ng/ml) CsA alters the TLR4- and/
or Nod-mediated cellular response in MCD cells. The CXCL2
production caused by UPEC significantly decreased in untreated
Tlr42/2 MCD cells compared to WT, Nod12/2, or Nod22/2
MCD cells, and also decreased to almost the same extent in CsA￾treated WT, Nod12/2, or Nod22/2 MCD cells than in CsA-treated

Tlr42/2 MCD cells (Figure 4F, upper panel). As controls, similar
profiles of CXCL2 production were obtained by incubating WT,
Nod12/2, and Nod22/2 MCD cells with LPS, and no significant
production of CXCL2 was detected in Tlr42/2 MCD cells
(Figure 4F, lower panel). These findings thus suggest that CsA
mainly affects the predominant TLR4-mediated production of
CXCL2 and has only a minor effect on epithelial Nod1- and
Nod2-mediated renal tubule cell activation caused by UPEC. CsA
also significantly reduced the ability of LPS-activated confluent
WT MCD cells, which developed high electrical transepithelial
resistance (,4500 V. cm2
), to stimulate the in vitro migration
capacity of neutrophils as compared to untreated WT MCD cells
incubated with LPS (Figure S4A to C). As a control, Tlr42/2
MCD cells challenged with LPS did not stimulate the migration of
neutrophils (Figure S4B and C).
We next analyzed the effects of CsA on Tlr4 and Nod mRNAs
expression in neutrophils, macrophages, and renal DCs. Incubat￾ing primary bone marrow neutrophils with CsA for 8 h or bone
marrow macrophages (BMMs) with CsA for longer times (48 h)
significantly decreased the relative levels of Nod1 mRNA and
protein expressions, and to a lesser extent reduced the expression
of Nod2 mRNA, but not that of Tlr4 mRNA (Figure 5A, B, D and
E). Renal DCs expressing Nod1 and Nod2 [37], were shown to
produce substantial amounts of CXCL2, which is involved in the
recruitment of neutrophils in the kidneys following UPEC
challenge [26,27,38]. Incubating highly-enriched CD11c+ cells
isolated from WT kidneys by gradient centrifugation and magnetic
beads separation [39] with 100 nM CsA for 48 h significantly
reduced Nod1 mRNA expression without affecting the expression
of Tlr4 or Nod2 (Figure 5G). However, the small number of
purified renal CD11c+ cells obtained did not permit reliable
Western blot analysis of the Nod1 protein. Consistent with an
inhibitory action of CsA on Nod1, the production of CCL5, which
has been shown to be highly sensitive to Nod agonist stimulation
[40], when stimulated by the Nod1 agonist FK156 was signifi￾cantly lower in CsA-treated than in untreated neutrophils and
macrophages (Figure 5C and F). CsA only slightly, and non￾significantly, reduced the FK156-stimulated production of CCL5
in renal DCs (Figure 5H). Given that CXCL2 plays an essential
role in the recruitment of neutrophils, we went on to test the effects
of CsA on CXCL2 production in neutrophils, macrophages, and
renal DCs. Unlike renal MCD cells, CsA only slightly reduced the
CXCL2 production stimulated by LPS in neutrophils, macro￾phages, and renal DCs (Figure 5C, F and H). Taken as a whole,
these findings indicate that CsA globally impairs the functional
expression of Nod1 in neutrophils, macrophages, and renal DCs.
Since Nod1 senses a number of invasive Gram-negative
bacteria, we tested whether UPEC can directly activate Nod1
mRNA expression in macrophages and whether CsA impairs the
UPEC-induced activation of Nod1. Incubating WT BMMs with
UPEC for 3 h had almost no stimulatory effect on Tlr4 mRNA
expression, but in contrast induced a significant increase in Nod1

and Nod2 mRNAs expression (Figure S5). Pre-incubating BMMs
with CsA impairs the increase in Nod1 mRNA expression, and to a
much lesser extent that of Nod2, caused by the subsequent
incubation with UPEC for additional 3 h (Figure S5). These
findings further suggest that CsA preferentially alters the activation
of Nod1 induced by UPEC in phagocytic cells.
Silencing NFATc1 mRNA expression and the 11R-VIVIT
peptide inhibitor of NFATs markedly inhibit Nod1 mRNA
expression in macrophages
CsA inhibits the nuclear translocation of NFATs, which in turn
inhibit the transcription of T cell effector cytokines [8]. Because
CsA preferentially alters Nod1 expression in phagocytic cells,
experiments were carried out to test whether the downregulation
of the NFATc1 isoform, which is highly expressed in both murine
and human neutrophils and macrophages [41,42], impairs mRNA
expression of Nods. Because neutrophils have a limited life-span,
experiments were carried out on mouse BMMs. Knockdown of
NFATc1 mRNA expression using a multiple set of NFATc1 siRNAs
(referred to as NFATc1a–d siRNA) in WT BMMs resulted in the
almost complete inhibition of the expression of NFATc1 mRNA
when compared to non-transfected WT BMMs or cells transfected
with a control siRNA (Figure 6A). Silencing NFATc1 by the set of
NFATc1 siRNAs markedly inhibited the relative level of Nod1
mRNA expression, but had almost no effect on Nod2 mRNA
expression (Figure 6B). To further assess the inhibitory action of

11R-VIVIT had no effect on Tlr4 mRNA expression (Figure S6A
and B). Given that inhibition of NFATc1 can affect the
transcriptional expression of many proteins, the possibility that a
contrario in vitro activation of NFATs could specifically stimulate the
expression of Nod1 was investigated. NFATs are activated by
increased intracellular calcium concentration during T-cell acti￾vation [7]. Calcium mobilization induces the dephosphorylation of
cytosolic NFATs which translocate into the nucleus [44].
Ionomycin (2 mM, 60 min) induced the translocation of NFATc1
from the cytosol into nuclei from WT BMMs, whereas the pre￾incubation of WT BMMs with CsA or 11R-VIVIT totally or
almost totally impaired the nuclear translocation of NFATc1
caused by subsequent addition of ionomycin (Figure 6D).
Ionomycin also significantly stimulated Nod1, but failed to
stimulate Nod2 and Tlr4 mRNAs expression in WT BMMs
compared to untreated cells, or to cells pre-treated with CsA or
11R-VIVIT (Figure 6E and Figure S6C). Collectively, these data
strongly suggest a role for NFATc1 as a transcriptional activator of
Nod1.
In vivo administration of 11R-VIVIT impairs neutrophil
bacterial phagocytic killing capacity of UPEC and
increases renal susceptibility to UPEC
Given that the 11R-VIVIT inhibited Nod1 mRNA expression,
11R-VIVIT should also impair the Nod1-mediated bacterial
phagocytic function and decrease the renal defense against UPEC.
NPCs isolated from WT mice given daily intraperitoneal injections
of 10 mg/kg 11R-VIVIT for 48 h exhibited a significant lower ex
vivo capacity to internalize E. coli and lower phagocytic killing of
serum-opsonized UPEC than untreated NPCs (Figure 7A and B).

24 h after the inoculation of UPEC, 11R-VIVIT-treated mice
exhibited reduced intrarenal MPO activity and reduced amount of
immunodetected Nod1 protein, and significant greater renal
bacterial burden than in non-treated WT mice (Figure 7C to E).
Nod1 stimulating agents partially restore the CsA￾induced downregulation of Nod1 and renal resistance to
UPEC
The fact that the stimulation of Nod1 can enhance systemic
innate immunity [20] and that the administration of Nod1 peptide
agonists to mice confer resistance against several pathogens [45],
led us to test whether the stimulation of Nod1 by synthetic Nod1-
stimulating agonists could reinforce renal defense against UPEC.
The cell-permeable Nod1 activating agonist C12-iEDAP (50 mg/
ml for 24 h) induced a significant increase in Nod1 mRNA
expression, which overcome the inhibition of Nod1 mRNA
expression caused by CsA alone (not shown). We then tested
whether the in vivo administration of synthetic Nod1 agonists can
reactivate Nod1-mediated phagocytic function and reinforce renal
resistance of CsA-treated mice to UPEC. The capacity of
neutrophils to internalize Texas red-coupled E. coli was greater
in neutrophils from CsA-treated mice that had been treated with
C12-iEDAP than in those collected from CsA-treated mice which
had not received C12-iEDAP (Figure 8A). Furthermore, intra￾peritoneal injection of C12-iEDAP or FK156 (80 mg/mouse) one
day before the transurethral inoculation of UPEC to CsA-treated
WT mice, induced significant reduction in the renal bacterial
burden when compared to CsA-treated mice which had not
received C12-iEDAP or FK156, or CsA-treated mice which had
received the Nod2 agonist MDP (Figure 8B). The observed
decrease in renal bacterial burden was associated with greater
MPO activity in the infected kidneys from CsA-treated mice pre￾treated with the Nod1 agonists (Figure 8C). Figure 8D illustrates
the greater amount of Nod1 protein in the infected kidneys from
CsA-treated mice which had been pre-treated with FK156. The
amounts of CXCL2 and CXCL1 secreted were not significantly
different in the 24-h, post-infected kidneys from CsA-treated mice
and the vehicle-treated mice (Figure 8E), suggesting that the
administration of Nod1 agonists does not induce any major renal
inflammatory response. Collectively, these findings are consistent
with the restimulation of Nod1-mediated host protective functions
in CsA-treated mice.
Human transplant recipients treated with CsA exhibit
downregulated expression of NOD1
Investigations were performed on blood samples from random
renal transplant recipients treated with CsA (n = 25) to test
whether human renal transplant recipients exhibit similar decrease
in NOD1 expression and defective NOD1-mediated bacterial
phagocytosis capacity. The demographic characteristics of renal

transplant recipients are summarized in Table S1. Transplant
recipients all received CsA and additional immunosuppressive
drugs, including prednisolone and mycophenolate mofetil, which
is a selective inhibitor of the de novo synthesis of guanosine
nucleotides in T and B lymphocytes [46]. For comparison,
investigations were also performed on healthy volunteers (n = 10)
used as controls. The production of IL-8 was first measured in
whole blood samples incubated with various TLR and NOD
agonists. The levels of IL-8 triggered by all TLR agonists tested
did not significantly differ in blood samples from transplant
recipients and normal healthy controls (Figure 9A). In contrast, the
levels of IL-8 production stimulated by the human NOD1
synthetic agonist M-TriDAP was significantly less in blood samples
from the transplant recipients treated with CsA than in normal
controls (Figure 9A and B). The levels of NOD1 mRNA, but not
those of NOD2, TLR2, or TLR4 mRNAs extracted from whole
blood samples, were also significantly lower in transplant recipients
than in normal controls (Figure 9C). Flow cytometry analysis of
phagocytosis of Texas red-coupled E. coli and quantification of
NOD1 in human neutrophils also revealed that the low levels of
NOD1 in the neutrophils from CsA-treated renal transplant
recipients were closely correlated with their capacity to phagocyte
E. coli, which was significantly lower than in the neutrophils from
normal healthy controls (Figure 9D). Moreover, three of the
transplant recipients analyzed who exhibited low NOD1 expres￾sion and low capacity of E. coli phagocytosis by neutrophils had a
previous history of UTI/APN. These findings suggest that the
NFATs-dependent inhibitory mechanism of Nod1-mediated
innate immune response identified in the mouse also occurs in
human transplant recipients treated with CsA.
Discussion
In the present work, we show that in mice, CsA reduces renal
resistance to the retrograde inoculation of uropathogenic E. coli.
CsA induces a significant decrease in the production of the
chemoattractant chemokines and impairs the recruitment of
neutrophils in kidneys from mice infected by UPEC. The primary
source (i.e. the epithelial tubule cells or circulating immune cells) of
pro-inflammatory mediators produced in experimental models of
UTI remains discussed. In accordance with a number of previous
studies, medullary collecting duct epithelial cells, which are the
first renal tubule cells to come into contact with UPEC during
their retrograde ascent, produce substantial amounts of TLR4-
mediated CXCL2, which play a key role in the recruitment of
neutrophils in the infected kidneys [23,27,47]. The fact that CsA
impairs LPS-induced production of CXCL2 in renal MCD cells
and LPS-induced recruitment of neutrophils, further suggests that
the Tlr4-mediated activation of renal epithelial cells contributes to
the recruitment of neutrophils in the infected kidneys, at least
during the initial phase of infection. Nor can we exclude the
possibility that the decrease in Tlr4 mRNA expression detected in
the infected kidneys and in the Tlr4-mediated cell activation
detected in murine MCD cells, are due, at least in part, to the
cytotoxic action of calcineurin inhibitors [48]. In contrast, CsA
had no in vitro inhibitory effect on Tlr4 expression in neutrophils,
macrophages, or renal DCs. After being bound to renal collecting
duct cells, UPEC induces the rapid recruitment of neutrophils
(during the first 6 h), followed by the recruitment of monocytes/
macrophages over the next 12–24 h. Although LPS stimulates the
in vitro production of CXCL2 by neutrophils and inflammatory
monocytes/macrophages, these cells do not seem to play major
roles in the renal production of chemoattractant chemokines
during UPEC infection [38]. Recently, resident renal DCs have
been shown to be major source of CXCL2 production, compared
to neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages, 20 h following the
retrograde inoculation of UPEC [38]. Furthermore, the migration
capacity of neutrophils has been reported to be significantly lower
in UPEC-infected CD11c deficient mice than in their WT

counterparts [38], indicating that CXCL2 production by renal
DCs certainly plays some role in the chemoattraction of
neutrophils. Here we show that CsA altered Nod1 mRNA
expression in renal DCs, without impairing Tlr4 mRNA expres￾sion and the number of renal DCs in the infected kidneys.
Although in vitro incubation of renal DCs with CsA did not have
much effect on the in vitro LPS-induced CXCL2 production, we
cannot exclude any in vivo participation of renal DCs in the
defective migration capacity of neutrophils within infected kidneys
from CsA-treated mice.
The present study demonstrated an unexpected effect of CsA on
Nod1-mediated neutrophils migration capacity and bacterial
phagocytosis. We show both in vivo and in vitro that CsA impairs
Nod1 expression in neutrophils and macrophages. The stimulation
of Nod1 by Nod1 stimulating agonist or bacteria was shown to
play a role in the recruitment of neutrophils in the intestine
[18,49], and that the number of infiltrating neutrophils was shown
to be significantly reduced in injured livers from Nod12/2 mice
challenged with carbon tetrachloride [30]. We also detected
defective recruitment of neutrophils in kidneys from Nod12/2 mice
infected by UPEC, and in infected kidneys of WT mice treated
with CsA. Given that CsA, which affects TLR4-mediated CXCL2
production in MCD cells and alters the expression of Nod1 in
neutrophils, macrophages, and also renal DCs, these findings
suggest that, in addition to impairing the epithelial TLR4-
mediated production of chemoattractant chemokines, CsA may
also alter the Nod1-mediated capacity of neutrophils to migrate in
kidneys infected with UPEC.
Recent studies have highlighted the role of NFAT/calcineurin
signaling pathways in controlling innate immunity and in
regulating homeostasis of immune cells. Calcineurin/NFATs
signaling was shown to negatively regulate myeloid lineage
development [50]. The susceptibility to fungal infection caused
by CsA was also shown to be the consequence of NFAT￾dependent inhibition of an immune innate pathway regulating
antifungal resistance in neutrophils. Indeed, Greenblatt et al. [42]
reported that the neutrophils of both calcineurin-deficient mice
and CsA-treated mice exhibited a defective ability to kill Candida
albicans without any noticeable changes in the classical fungicidal
activity of neutrophils. These authors showed that calcineurin
regulates the ability of neutrophils to kill C. albicans via another
anti-microbial pathway, which involves the C-type lectin-like
receptor dectin-1 and IL-10 production. Given that Nod1 and
Nod2 are not directly involved in the recognition of C. albicans
[51], these findings suggest that CsA may affect NFATs-dependent
cellular signaling activated by Gram-negative bacteria or fungi in

different ways. The NFATc3/c4 isoforms were also shown to be
required for TLR-induced innate inflammatory response in
monocytes/macrophages [52]. Our results strongly suggest that
NFATc1 controls Nod1 at the transcriptional level. In silico analysis
(Genomatix Software GmbH) has identified putative NFAT binding
sites in human and murine Nod1 and Nod2 promoter regions.
Downexpression of NFATc1 inhibited Nod1 more efficiently than
Nod2. However, the in silico analysis did not permit us to predict
differences in the number of putative binding sites for NFATc1 on
the promoter regions of Nod1 and/or Nod2. We have no direct
explanation for the preferential inhibitory effect of silencing
NFATc1 on Nod1 expression. The fact that much less Nod1 than
Nod2 is present in immune cells may account, at least in part, for
the greater reduction in Nod1 mRNA expression induced by
NFATc1 silencing. Nevertheless our findings strongly suggest that
CsA, through NFATc1 inhibition, alters Nod1-mediated phago￾cytic functions. In agreement with this, inhibition of the
calcineurin phosphatase activity has been reported to decrease
phagocytosis in macrophages [53], further suggesting that
NFATc1 is essential for proper activation of the phagocytosis
process. Collectively, these findings indicate that NFATs, which
play key roles in adaptive T cell functions, are critical cellular
mediators of the innate immune responses.
Although the present findings indicate that CsA directly alters
Nod1 expression, it may also affect other immune receptors and
downstream signaling pathways in various different ways. Calci￾neurin serine threonine phosphatase downregulates TLR-mediated
signaling pathways in macrophages, whereas CsA and its newer
counterpart Tacrolimus have been shown to activate NF-kB and
induce cytokine expression in inactivated macrophages [54]. It has
been also reported that the activation of DCs and macrophages by
Tacrolimus can induce a state of reduced responsiveness to LPS
[55], similar to the LPS-induced transient state of tolerance
observed following a subsequent LPS challenge [56]. During
bacterial infection, it seems likely that various TLRs and NLRs are
activated in response to the invading pathogen or to microbial
components, such as LPS or PGN, released into the bloodstream
and in the infected tissues [57]. Moreover, the interplay between
Nods and TLRs may be critical for the induction of protective
immune responses [14,58,59]. Therefore, it is conceivable that
altered epithelial TLR4-mediated chemokine production caused by
CsA, may potentiate the deleterious inhibitory effects of CsA on
Nod1-mediated neutrophil functions, leading to a more pronounced
decrease in host resistance to bacterial infection.
Long-term use of immunosuppressive drugs, used to prevent
graft rejection, increases the susceptibility of transplant recipients
towards bacterial infection [2,5,6]. Until recently, the impact of
immunosuppressive therapy was considered to be largely non￾specific. However, several groups of researchers have reported
changes in the numbers and/or functions of circulating leukocytes,
including polymorphonuclear neutrophils from transplant patients
acquiring infections [21,22]. Moreover, it has already been
suggested that abnormalities in neutrophil functions, including
impaired migration capacity following fMLP stimulation, are

indicators of sepsis in solid organ transplant recipients [60].
Neutrophils from renal transplant recipients have been reported to
exhibit diminished phagocytic activity and reduce bactericidal
activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae, compared to the activities seen
with neutrophils from healthy subjects [61]. In vitro studies have
also shown that CsA reduces both neutrophil phagocytosis
capacity and ROS production [62,63]. Analysis of a panel of
blood leukocyte phenotypes and functions also revealed that
transplant recipients (renal and renal/pancreas) most of whom
were receiving CsA and subjected to infection exhibited a
reduction in ROS production [21]. In the present study, the
investigations performed on renal transplant recipients have
revealed downregulated expression of NOD1 in circulating
leukocytes, similar to that found in CsA-treated mice. The low
capacity for E. coli phagocytosis appears to be closely correlated
with a low expression of NOD1 in the neutrophils of renal
transplant recipients. Since Nod12/2 mice are more susceptible
than WT to early Streptococcus pneumoniae sepsis, and conversely,
that PGN recognition by Nod1 enhances killing of S. pneumoniae
and Staphylococcus aureus by neutrophils [19], it is conceivable that
the observed downregulation of NOD1 caused by CsA may also
impair the capacity of neutrophils from renal transplant recipients
to kill Gram-positive bacteria. However, we cannot exclude the
possibility that the results from investigations performed in human
renal transplant recipients could have been flawed by several
confounding factors, such as the concomitant administration of
several immunosuppressive drugs and some degree of renal
impairment. The consistency with which CsA downregulated
NOD1 strongly suggests that the impairment of NOD1-mediated
bacterial phagocytic capacity caused by CsA may therefore
represent an additional risk factor for the occurrence of UTI/
APN in human transplant recipients. Despite antibiotic prophy￾laxis, the frequency of post-graft UTI/APN still remains relatively
high, and increasing the resistance of bacteria to antibiotics may
also increase the risk of recurrent episodes of UTI/APN. This
raises the question of whether alternative therapeutic strategies
could help to reduce the frequency of post-graft UTI/APN. A
number of studies have provided convincing evidences that pre￾treatment of mice with Nod agonists enhances host protection
against sepsis, bacterial infection, viruses, or even parasites [64].
Here we also show that administration of Nod1 agonists can
restore efficient renal clearance of UPEC in CsA-treated mice.
However, further studies will be required to find out whether the
administration of synthetic Nod1 agonists alone or in combination
with antibiotics could potentially help to reduce the occurrence of
UTI/APN in renal grafts.
In summary, we have identified a hitherto-unknown mechanism
of the NFATc1-dependent inhibitory action of the Nod1-mediated
innate immune response, which may affect host renal antibacterial
defenses against invasive uropathogens, and possibly favor the
emergence of bacterial infection in renal transplant recipients
receiving long-term CsA treatment.

Renal retrograde infection in mice
Adult female (8–10 week old) WT mice (supplied by the Centre
d’Elevage Janvier, Le Genest-Saint-Isle, France), Rag22/2 mice, and
Nod12/2 and Nod22/2 mice from the same C57BL/6 genetic
background were used. Mice were infected with the uropathogenic E.
coli strain HT7 (108 bacteria in 50 ml sterile PBS) introduced via the
transurethral route into the bladder as described [4,25]. 100 ml CsA
(Neoral, Novartis International Pharmaceutical Ltd, 15 mg/kg), or its
vehicle (castor oil) were administered sub-cutaneously to mice for 5
days before the inoculation of UPEC. Bacterial loads (CFU) in kidneys
were determined 24 h after infection by plating. Kidney sections were
stained using anti-E. coli antibody (Interchim), anti-Ly6-G antibody
(BD Biosciences), or aquaporin-2 (AQP-2) as described [23].
Cultured collecting duct cells
Primary cultures of medullary collecting duct (MCD) isolated
from WT, Nod12/2, Nod22/2, and Tlr42/2 mice kidneys were
grown as described [23]. Experiments were carried out on
confluent cells two weeks after seeding.
Macrophage, neutrophil, and renal dendritic cell isolation
Bone marrow neutrophils and circulating blood neutrophils
were isolated by gradient density centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque
PREMIUM (GE Healthcare) as described elsewhere [20]. Bone
marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) were isolated and grown as
described [40]. Indirect immunofluorescence studies were per￾formed on WT BMMs using a mouse anti-NFATc1 monoclonal
antibody (Thermo Scientific Pierce Antibodies) and Sytox green
nucleic acid stain (Invitrogen). Renal dendritic CD11c+ cells were
isolated as previously described with slight modifications [39,65].
For each cell preparation both kidneys from 5 naı¨ve WT mice
were used. Briefly, the kidneys of each mouse were minced and
then digested for 45 min at 37uC with 1 mg/ml collagenase
(Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France) and 10 mg/ml DNAse I in
RPMI 1640-Glutamax medium (Life Technologies) supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 10 mM HEPES,
100 U penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Kidney homoge￾nates from each mouse were then filtered through 70 mm nylon
mesh, washed with PBS, centrifuged (250 g, 5 min), resuspended
in 3 ml of 0.01 M ethylenediaminetetracetic acid (EDTA) in FCS
and layered on top of 3 ml Histopaque-1077 (Sigma). Density
centrifugation (400 g, 30 min) was performed at room tempera￾ture. The interphase cells were then harvested, washed, and
resuspended in 600 ml MACS buffer (Miltenyi Biotec.). CD11c+
cells were then isolated using microbead-labeled specific mono￾clonal antibody (clone N418, Miltenyi Biotec.), and separated
using magnetic beads according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The enriched- CD11c+ cell suspension obtained from 5 mice were
then pooled and used for the cytokine assay.
In vitro neutrophil migration assay
The migration capacity of neutrophils isolated from untreated
or CsA-treated WT mice or Nod12/2 mice was analyzed using the
Cyclosporine A Downregulates Nod1

Boyden chamber technique as previously described [30]. After the
lysis of red blood cells, blood samples from vehicle- and CsA￾treated WT were laid on the top of a Ficoll-Paque PREMIUM
(GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) density gradient, then centri￾fuged (400 g, 30 min at 4uC), and the bottom layer containing the
neutrophil-enriched fraction was collected. 106 neutrophils were
then resuspended in 200 ml Hank’s buffered salt solution (HBSS)
containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and added to the upper
compartment of a Transwell Clear membrane insert (3 mm pore
size, Corning Inc., Lowel, MA). The lower compartment (600 ml)
of the chamber contained either HBSS alone or supplemented
with fMLP (1027 M) or CXCL2 (200 ng/ml). Incubations were
performed at 37uC for 40 min in a 5% CO2/95% air atmosphere.
A neutrophil migration assay was also carried out using isolated
WT and Tlr42/2 MCDs seeded and grown to confluence in
defined DMEM/Hams’F12 culture medium [23] on the apical
side of the filters. Confluent WT MCD cells were then incubated
with or without 100 ng/ml CsA for 48 h, then with or without
(10 ng/ml) LPS, which was added when required to the upper
compartment of the chamber for 4 h in a 5% CO2/95% air
atmosphere. The lower compartment contained 106 WT neutro￾phils resuspended in 600 ml defined culture medium. In all cases,
the filters were rinsed, then fixed in methanol and stained using the
RAL 555 Kit (Re´actifs RAL, Martillac, France). The neutrophils
(stained deep purple) detected in the filters were counted by
microscopic observation. MCD cells (stained pale red) were also
stained using the RAL kit containing eosin. In parallel, the
transepithelial electrical resistance (RT) was measured using dual
silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) electrodes connected to a Millicel￾ERS voltohmmeter (Millipore, Billerica, MA).
E. coli phagocytosis and bacterial killing assay
Enriched-neutrophil peritoneal cells collected by peritoneal
lavages 3 h after a single intraperitoneal injection of 1.5 ml of
thioglycollate (Bio-Rad Laboratories) were incubated with Texas
red-coupled E. coli (104 bacteria/107 cells) for 30 min at 37uC, and
then stained with CD11b-FITC or Wheat Germ Agglutinin
(WGA)-Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen) to delineate cell peripheries.
The internalization of E. coli was determined by measuring the
intracellular red fluorescence intensity using confocal microscopy
analysis as described elsewhere [66]. For the ex vivo bacterial killing
assay, E. coli were mixed without or with peritoneal neutrophils
(103 bacteria/106 neutrophils) following the same procedure as
described elsewhere [20].
Renal transplant recipients
Blood samples from 25 renal transplant recipients with a
functioning graft during the first three years after surgery and
exposed to CsA (Table S1) were randomly taken during the
regular routine consultations at Tenon hospital (Assistance
Publique-Hoˆpitaux de Paris, France). In all cases, the blood
samples were taken at least 6 months after surgery. In addition, ten
healthy volunteers served as normal controls.
Real-time PCR and reverse transcription PCR
Total RNA from mouse kidneys, neutrophils, or macrophages
was purified with RNAble (Eurobio laboratories) and reverse
transcribed using Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus reverse
transcriptase (Invitrogen). cDNA was subjected to quantitative
real-time PCR using a Chromo IV sequence detector (MJ
Research). The mouse Tlr2, Tlr4, Nod1, Nod2 and ß-actin primers
used and the corresponding Taqman probes are listed in Table S2.
PCR data were reported as the relative increase in mRNA
transcripts versus that found in uninfected kidneys or vehicle-treated
neutrophils or macrophages cells and corrected using the respective
levels of ß-actin mRNA. Quantitative real-time PCR was also
performed on RNA extracted from blood samples of renal
transplant recipients using human TLR2, TLR4, NOD1, NOD2,
and ß-ACTIN primers and corresponding Taqman probes (listed in
Table S2). PCR data were reported as the relative increase in
mRNA transcripts versus that found in a pool of RNA of untreated
leukocytes from healthy volunteers. For reverse transcription PCR,
cDNA and non-reverse transcribed RNA (250 ng) from cultured
mouse MCD cells or BMMs were amplified for 35 cycles in 35 ml of
Platinum Blue PCR SuperMix (Invitrogen) containing 10 pmol of
mouse NFATc1, Tlr4, Nod1, Nod2, or GAPDH primers (described in
Table S2). Amplification products were run on a 2% agarose gel
containing SYBR Safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen) and photo￾graphed.
Small interfering RNA
Experiments were performed using different predesigned HP
GenomeWide (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) siRNAs (referred to
as NFATc1a, b, c, and d) for the murine NFATc1 gene target DNA
sequence. NFATc1a DNA sequence: 59-TCGGATCGAGGTG￾CAGCCCAA-39; sense: 59-GGAUCGAGGUGCAGCCCAATT￾39; antisense: 59-UUGGGCUGCACCUCGAUCCGA-39; NFA￾Tc1b DNA sequence: 59-CACGGTTACTTGGAGAATGAA-39;
sense: 59-CGGUUACUUGGAGAAUGAATT-39; antisense: 59-
UUCAUUCUCCAAGUAACCGTG-39; NFATc1c DNA se￾quence: 59-CCCGTCCAAGTCAGTTTCTAT-39; sense: 59-
CGUCCAAGUCAGUUUCUAUTT-39; antisense: 59-AUA￾GAAACUGACUUGGACGGG-39; NFATc1d DNA sequence:
59-CCGGGACCTGTGCAAGCCAAA-39; sense: 59-GGGAC￾CUGUGCAAGCCAAATT-39; antisense: 59-UUUGGCUUG￾CACAGGUCCCGG-39. A universal negative control siRNA
(target DNA sequence: 59-AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT￾39; sense: 59-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUdTdT-39; anti￾sense: 59 ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAAdTdT-39) was also
used (Qiagen). Single strand sense and antisense RNA nucleotides
were annealed to generate a RNA duplex according to the
Manufacturer’s instructions. WT BMMs were seeded in 6-well
plates and incubated with 10 nM of each siRNA tested and 2 ml of
Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Reagent (Invitrogen) for 48 h at 37uC
before use. As a control, we checked that each of the NFATc1 (a to
d) siRNAs inhibited NFATc1 mRNA expression in macrophages
using reverse-transcription PCR (not shown).
Western blotting
Mouse kidney homogenates and BMMs were lysed and
processed for Western blotting using mouse anti-TLR4 [25]),
anti-Nod1 (Cell Signaling) or anti-Nod2 (eBiosciences) antibodies,
and phospho-RIP-2 (Ser 176), and total RIP-2 (Ozyme) antibod￾ies. Protein bands were revealed using horse raddish peroxidase￾conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch), and
analyzed by Western Blotting.
ELISA
Cytokine production was measured in mouse kidney homoge￾nates, or cell supernatants using DuoSet mouse ELISA kits (R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Neutrophils, macrophages, or
cultured MCD cells were incubated either with LPS (Escherichia
coli 0111:B4 LPS Ultra-Pure, InvivoGen, Toulouse, France),
50 mg/ml C12-iEDAP (InvivoGen), 1 mM FK156 (provided by
Nami Kawano, Astellas Pharma Inc., Osaka, Japan), or 1 mM
MDP (InvivoGen, Toulouse, France) for 8 to 18 h at 37uC. For
FK156 and MDP stimulations, mouse macrophages were pre￾treated with 1 mM cytochalasin D (Calbiochem, Darmstadt,
Cyclosporine A Downregulates Nod1
PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 13 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003152

Germany) for 30 min to allow efficient internalization of the
synthetic Nod activating agonists as described elsewhere [40].
Human blood samples (10 ml) were incubated in 500 ml RPMI
culture medium (Invitrogen) at 37uC alone or with 1 ng/ml
Pam3CSK4 (InvivoGen) or LPS, 1 mg/ml flagellin (InvivoGen);
50 mg/ml unmethylated CpG-DNA (HyCult Biotechnology,
Uden, The Netherlands), 50 nM MDP or various concentrations
(0.05–2 mM) of M-TriDAP (InvivoGen) for 18 h. IL-8 production
was measured using a DuoSet human ELISA kit (R&D Systems,
Lille, France). All the reagents used were tested negative for
endotoxin contamination using the Limulus amoebocyte assay
according to the Manufacturer’s recommendations (QCL-1000,
Biowhittaker, Buckinghamshire, UK). MPO activity was measured
using HyCult Biotechnology ELISA kit.
Flow cytometry analysis
The cell populations infiltrating the infected mouse kidneys were
analyzed by flow cytometry. 24 h after UPEC infection, kidneys
were carefully rinsed with PBS to remove the remaining circulating
blood cells. The kidneys were then minced and digested for 45 min
at 37uC with 1 mg/ml collagenase (Roche Diagnostics) and 10 mg/
ml DNAse I in the same RPMI 1640-Glutamax medium (Life
Technologies) as described above for the isolation of renal DCs.
After rinsing, kidney homogenates were then passed through a
70 mm pore sized nylon Cell Strainer (BD Biosciences) with 15 ml
PBS. The resulting cell suspension was centrifuged (1600 rpm,
10 min) again and then resuspended (106106 total cells/ml) in
FACS buffer containing 2% BSA and 0.05% sodium azide. Non￾specific binding of antibody to Fc receptors was blocked by
incubating the cell suspension with the anti-mouse CD16/32
(2.4G2) antibody (10 mg/ml) and ChromePure rat IgG (100 mg/ml,
Jackson Immunoresearch) for 30 min at 4uC. Cells were then
incubated in pre-determined optimal concentrations of fluoro￾chrome-conjugated antibodies to cell surface antigens or matching
isotype control antibodies for 30 min at 4uC. APC anti-mouse Ly￾6G/Ly-6C (Gr1; RB6-8C5), Pe anti-mouse F4/80 (BM8), PerCP/
Cy5.5 anti-mouse CD11b (M1/70), Pacific Blue anti-mouse (MHC￾II/IA/IE, M5/114.15.2) and PeCy7 anti-mouse CD45 (RA3-6B2),
and matching fluorophores-conjugated antibodies isotypes were
purchased from Biolegend. PeCy7 anti-mouse CD11c (HL3) and
V500 anti mouse CD45.2 (104) were purchased from BD
Pharmingen. Fluorescent measurements were conducted with
identical settings on at least 100,000 CD45+ cells per kidney per
experiment using a BD FACSCanto II cytometer operating BD
FACSDiva software v6.1.3 (BD Biosciences, Erembodegem,
Belgium), and FlowJo v7.6.5 (Tree Star. Inc., Ashland, OR).
Analyses of NOD1 expression and bacterial phagocytosis capacity
by human neutrophils were also analyzed by flow cytometry.
Human whole blood samples (1 ml) were incubated with Texas red￾coupled E. coli (107 bacteria) (Molecular Probes) with gentle stirring
for 30 min at 37uC, while negative control samples were kept on ice
before analysis. Red blood cells were then lyzed by adding 10 ml
NH4Cl 0.8% wt/vol for 15 min. Trypan blue (0.05 mg/ml) was
added to the samples to reduce the quenching of surface-bound
fluorescence. Samples were centrifuged (400 g, 10 min) at 4uC to
remove cell debris, and pelleted leukocytes were then rinsed in PBS.
In parallel, aliquots of NH4Cl-treated blood samples were
permeabilized with methanol, and then incubated with an anti￾human NOD1 antibody (Imgenex Corp.). All fluorescence mea￾surements were conducted with identical settings and forward and
side-scatter parameters to identify the neutrophil population and to
gate out other cells and debris [67].
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism
program. The unpaired t test, (two-tailed p values) was used to
compare two groups. The distribution of three or more groups was
analyzed by One-Way ANOVA and the Kruskal-Wallis test. The
Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the group with one
another. A p value,0.05 was considered significant.
