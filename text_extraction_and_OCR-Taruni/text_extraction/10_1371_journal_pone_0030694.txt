Abstract
Background: The importance of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions on asthma is well documented in literature,
but a systematic analysis on the interaction between various genetic and environmental factors is still lacking.
Methodology/Principal Findings: We conducted a population-based, case-control study comprised of seventh-grade
children from 14 Taiwanese communities. A total of 235 asthmatic cases and 1,310 non-asthmatic controls were selected for
DNA collection and genotyping. We examined the gene-gene and gene-environment interactions between 17 single￾nucleotide polymorphisms in antioxidative, inflammatory and obesity-related genes, and childhood asthma. Environmental
exposures and disease status were obtained from parental questionnaires. The model-free and non-parametrical multifactor
dimensionality reduction (MDR) method was used for the analysis. A three-way gene-gene interaction was elucidated
between the gene coding glutathione S-transferase P (GSTP1), the gene coding interleukin-4 receptor alpha chain (IL4Ra)
and the gene coding insulin induced gene 2 (INSIG2) on the risk of lifetime asthma. The testing-balanced accuracy on
asthma was 57.83% with a cross-validation consistency of 10 out of 10. The interaction of preterm birth and indoor
dampness had the highest training-balanced accuracy at 59.09%. Indoor dampness also interacted with many genes,
including IL13, beta-2 adrenergic receptor (ADRB2), signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6). We also used
likelihood ratio tests for interaction and chi-square tests to validate our results and all tests showed statistical significance.
Conclusions/Significance: The results of this study suggest that GSTP1, INSIG2 and IL4Ra may influence the lifetime asthma
susceptibility through gene-gene interactions in schoolchildren. Home dampness combined with each one of the genes
STAT6, IL13 and ADRB2 could raise the asthma risk.

Introduction
Asthma is the most common allergic disease giving rise to the
morbidity or school absence in children [1,2]. The prevalence of
childhood asthma is socially burdensome and results in significant
medical expenditure around the world [3]. Many gene and
environmental factors are associated with this complex disease, but
the effect of each of these factors is mild. It was known that
common diseases have complex etiologies such as the dependence
of genotypic effects on environmental factors (i.e., gene-environ￾ment interactions) and genotypes at other loci (i.e., gene-gene
interactions). Recently, there has been increased interest in gene￾gene and gene-environment interactions, which may affect asthma
pathophysiology.
Inflammatory lung diseases such as asthma [4] are associated
with reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are regulated by some
antioxidant genes and transcription factors. The epoxide hydrox￾ylase (EPHX1) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) genetic variants
are associated with an increased risk for lifetime asthma [5].
Obesity is an important risk factor in asthma [6,7,8]. Genetic
variations in the obesity-related genes beta-2 adrenergic receptor
(ADRB2), beta-3 adrenergic receptor (ADRB3), insulin induced
gene 2 (INSIG2), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
gamma (PPARc) are also included in our study [9]. Mindful of the
importance of inflammation in asthma, we further included several
inflammatory genes in our analysis. Interleukin (IL)-13, IL-4,
interleukin 4 receptor (IL-4Ra), signal transducer and activator of
transcription 6 (STAT6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa)
genes are key inflammatory genes in the development of allergic
diseases such as asthma [10,11,12,13,14,15]. Asthma candidate
genes are thought to contribute only 40–60% overall risk [16].
Gene-gene and gene-environmental interactions could explain the
residual influence for asthma etiology when a single candidate
gene is considered. This study is the first to systematically
investigate the potential gene-gene and gene-environmental
interactions on various physiological pathway genes on asthma.
Indoor exposure to dampness is suspected to be an important
environmental factor for the development of asthma and allergic

disease in modern societies. The Taiwan Children Health Study
(TCHS) is a population-based study from 14 Taiwanese
communities representing a wide range of exposures among
school-aged children. This study offers an opportunity to
investigate the interactive effects of gene-gene and gene-environ￾mental influences on children’s health. The multifactor dimen￾sionality reduction (MDR) approach allows high-dimensional
interactions of multiple factors to be simultaneously retrieved,
and has successfully identified gene-gene interactions in a variety
of diseases including breast cancer [17], essential hypertension
[18], type II diabetes [19], atrial fibrillation [20], coronary artery
calcification [21], and amyloid polyneuropathy [22]. In the
present study, gene-gene interactions for childhood asthma were
examined based on 17 SNPs in thirteen candidate genes,
encompassing three physiological groups. A number of environ￾mental factors thought to affect asthma were considered, and the
associations between candidate genes and environmental factors
were explored.
Results
Subjects and demographic data
Table 1 shows demographic characteristics and pulmonary
function indices for study participants. FEV1, MMEF and FEV1/
FVC in asthmatic children are generally lower than non-asthmatic
controls. A total of 17 SNPs from thirteen candidate genes were
selected for their association with childhood asthma (Table 2). All
SNPs were under the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) [23].
Environmental factors including in utero smoking, environmental
tobacco smoke (ETS), pets at home, incense burning, carpet use,
cockroaches in the home and indoor dampness were used to explore
the gene-environment interactions. The genotyping call rate for each
SNP was over 98% in our study. Data from 1,310 samples were
subjected to further gene-gene and gene-environment interaction
analysis.
Gene-gene interactions in childhood asthma
MDR was used to analyze gene-gene interaction models in
childhood asthma. The two- to ten-way gene-gene interaction
models are listed in Table 3. The SNP (rs1805010) in the IL4Ra
gene had the highest testing-balanced accuracy among the 17
SNPs. A three-way interaction found between GSTP1, IL4Ra and
INSIG2 showed the highest testing-balanced accuracy and cross￾validation consistency. A two-way interaction model of IL4Ra and
INSIG2 also exhibited high testing-balanced accuracy and cross￾validation consistency, but the testing-balanced accuracy was
lower than the three-way interaction model. In order to elucidate
potential two- and three-way gene-gene interactions in childhood
asthma, the top ten two-way and three-way interaction models
were listed (Table 4, Table 5). The rank was determined by the
training-balanced accuracy of MDR. In the two-way gene-gene
interaction models (Table 4), interaction between IL4Ra and
INSIG2 has the highest training-balanced accuracy at 56.82%.
IL4Ra also has a statistically significant interaction with EPHX1
exon4 in childhood asthma. For the three-way interaction models
(Table 5), interaction between GSTP1, IL4Ra, and INSIG2 had the
highest training-balanced accuracy. The information gain derived
by the entropy-based analysis in the MDR software package was
all positive in each pair-wise combination of GSTP1, IL4Ra and
INSIG2.
Moreover, the IL4Ra and INSIG2 gene combination interacted
with GSTP1, STAT6, ADRB2, ADRB3, IL13 and EPHX1 exon 3 to
reveal a high training-balanced accuracy above 58.38% in
childhood asthma.
Gene-environment interactions in childhood asthma
MDR analysis was used to investigate probable gene-environ￾ment interactions in childhood asthma, and revealed the
interaction between 17 SNPs and 9 environmental factors.
Dampness was found to be the most important environmental
factor affecting asthma susceptibility (Table 6). Two-way interac￾tions showed higher testing-balanced accuracy and cross-valida￾tion consistency, indicating that two-way interaction models were
the candidate gene-environment models in our population. The
top ten two-way interaction models are shown in Table 7. The
interaction of preterm birth and indoor dampness had the highest
training-balanced accuracy at 59.09%. IL4Ra-BMI interaction
also affected asthma susceptibility with a high training balanced
accuracy. In addition, indoor dampness also interacted with many
genes including IL13, ADRB2, and STAT6. The lowest training￾balanced accuracy was 57.34%, higher than the training-balanced
accuracy of 56.98% obtained when home dampness was a single
predictor (Table 6). In the two-way interaction listed in Table 7,
home dampness seems to be the most important environment
factor.
Validation of gene-gene and gene-environment
interactions
Two-way and three-way gene-gene and gene-environment
interactions were examined using the detailed interaction model
of MDR (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). We used the likelihood ratio tests to
validate the gene-gene interactions between IL4Ra and INSIG2 on
childhood asthma and the P-value was 0.029. The three-way
interaction between GSTP1, IL4Ra, and INSIG2 genes was also
significant (P for LRT interaction = 0.003).
Chi-square tests were used to validate the high risk and low risk
phenotype classification. The dimensional reduction of the three￾way gene-gene interaction between GSTP1, IL4Ra and INSIG2 is
shown in Fig. 1A. Of the 27 combinations of three-way gene-gene
interaction, GSTP1 GG, IL4Ra GA and INSIG2 GG resulted in the
highest risk for childhood asthma. Chi-square tests also showed
statistical significance (P,0.001) (Fig. 1B). The detailed model of
two-way gene-environment interaction between high risk and low
risk groups of childhood asthma is shown in Fig. 2A. In the two￾way gene-environment interaction model shown in Fig. 2B, the
interaction between preterm birth and indoor dampness revealed

the highest risk at 59.09%. The lowest risk combination in preterm
birth and dampness was 14.04%. Chi-square tests also showed
significant differences between high risk and low risk classification
on childhood asthma.
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to elucidate
potential interactions between antioxidative, inflammatory and
obesity-related genes on childhood asthma. Using an MDR
approach, our study suggests a three-way gene-gene interaction
between inflammatory gene IL4Ra, obesity-related gene INSIG2,
and antioxidative gene GSTP1. The three-way gene-gene
interaction between IL4Ra, INSIG2, and GSTP1 was not only
identified in gene-gene analyses but also confirmed in gene￾environment analyses in MDR approach. The entropy-based
analysis indicated that the interaction between GSTP1, IL4Ra and
INSIG2 was synergistic. The results of the gene-environment
interaction analyses showed that there was an association between
preterm birth and home dampness among schoolchildren.
Children carrying asthma candidate genes were more susceptible
to adverse effects of home dampness.
The link between asthma and obesity in childhood has been
examined in many epidemiological studies [24,25,26]. A recent
meta-analysis showed that children with high body weight were at
increased risk of developing asthma [7]. Patients with allergic
asthma showed significant higher BMI and insulin resistance than
non-asthmatic controls [27]. Some adipokines secreted by adipose
tissue have pro-inflammatory effects and also show the potential to
modulate the Th2 immunity [28]. SNP rs7566605 in INSIG2 gene
is a common genetic variant associated with obesity [29]. Herbert
and colleagues reported the association between SNP (rs7566605)
upstream of the INSIG2 with higher BMI [29]. The SNP
(rs7566605) genotype CC was significantly associated with obesity.

In animal models, the INSIG1 and INSIG2 gene double-knockout
mice were found to be more obese than the control mice [30]. We
found that the INSIG2 gene played a key role in the three-way
gene-gene interaction (Table 3). Our results constitute new
evidence that obesity-related genes may show interactive effects
with asthma candidate genes, such as antioxidative and Th2
pathway inflammatory genes.
Although the underlying mechanism for the link between
asthma and obesity is still not fully understood, some pathophys￾iological pathways have been suggested , such as altered lung
mechanics, enhanced systemic pro-inflammatory state, shared
inherited predispositions and dietary intake [31], as well as the
increased systemic oxidant stress [8,32]. In a community-based
study, Keaney et al. reported that BMI was strongly associated

with the increased systemic oxidative stress, estimated by 8-epi￾PGF2a [33]. Correlation between fat accumulation and systemic
oxidative stress was also found in animal models. In obese mice,
reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was noted to be increased
selectively in adipose tissue, accompanied by decreased expression
of antioxidative enzymes [34]. ROS is responsible for many
chronic lung diseases such as asthma, and is proposed to be the
major source of cell and tissue damage [4]. Glutathione￾transferases (GSTs) play important roles in airway antioxidant
defenses [4], and theGSTP1 gene contributes more than 90% of
GST-derived enzyme activity in human lung epithelium [35]. Our
findings suggest that the GSTP1 gene may be the most important
gene in the antioxidative gene group (Table 3). The three-way
gene-gene interaction involves GSTP1 and INSIG2 characterize the
obesity affects on antioxidative gene further influence asthma.
Obesity-associated low-grade systemic inflammation has been
suggested to be a major factor mediating the asthma susceptibility
in many studies [36,37,38]. Polymorphisms in the inflammatory
gene IL4Ra are associated with numerous atopic diseases such as
asthma [39,40]. In a previous study among German children, the
combination of the IL4, IL13, STAT6 and IL4Ra genes was
revealed to increase the risk of bronchial asthma up to 16.8 times
compared with the effects of individual gene polymorphisms [41].
IL13 and IL4 cytokines produced by Th2 cells and inducing IgE
after allergen exposure are noted to share a common receptor
IL4Ra [42]. The IL4Ra is a key component in the induction of the

Th2 lymphocyte phenotype and its antagonist improved respira￾tory function and asthma control in human studies [43,44].
Results from the top ten gene-gene interaction models elucidated
the IL4Ra gene as a hub for gene-gene interactions on childhood
asthma (Table 5), supporting that the IL4Ra gene may be the key
regulatory element of the Th2 immune response. Gene-gene
interaction between IL13 and IL4Ra was reported to affect asthma
in white Dutch and Chinese populations [45]. Since MDR
determines one optimal interaction model that can successfully
predict high/low risk asthma phenotype, the combination of IL13
and IL4Ra gene may not be the optimal model in our analysis.
Asthma is a complex disease affected by many genetic factors,
which in turn may be influenced by environmental exposures.
Taiwan is located in a subtropical climate zone, with high
temperatures and humidity (monthly mean 68–80%). Home
dampness is a common problem and an important environmental
factor for asthma [46,47,48,49]. However, few studies are
concerned with the genetic modification effects of home dampness
on childhood asthma [50]. In our data, the gene-environmental
MDR analyses showed that home dampness is the most important
environmental factor on childhood asthma (Table 7). Using home
dampness as a predictor, the testing accuracy on asthma is 56.98%
(Table 6). Home dampness combined with each one of the genes
STAT6, IL13 and ADRB2 raised the testing accuracy on asthma
higher than 57.34% (Table 7). Our findings from interaction
models with significant permutated p-values but non-significant
explicit p-values might be due to the strong marginal effects from
environment variables.
The six-way interaction model also showed 10/10 cross￾validation consistency and high training-balanced accuracy
(tables 3), but this result was not followed-up due to low testing￾balanced accuracy. Low testing-balanced accuracy may be caused
by the model over-fitting problem, in which the generated model
fits the training data too well, increasing the high generalization
error [51]. The presence of noise or paucity of representative
samples in the training dataset is possible causes of model over￾fitting. A model that is too complex may fit the noise, leading to
lower testing-balanced efficiency. In our analysis, we used a 10-
fold cross-validation approach to avoid the model over-fitting
problem.
Our study has some limitations. Asthma assessment was based
on parental questionnaire reports. Although misclassification of
asthma status may have arisen, questionnaires are widely used to
define respiratory outcomes in epidemiologic studies among
children [52,53]. Another possible limitation is the retrospective
recall of environmental exposures by questionnaire, which is likely
to have resulted in some misclassification. However, the reliability
and validity of questionnaire on measuring dampness exposure has
been verified by a strong association between inspectors and self￾reported dampness [51,52]. Due to limitations of the MDR model
approach, any participants with missing data were eliminated in
our study, which made selection bias possible. However, in our
analysis it was found that participants without missing data did not
differ greatly from all eligible participants on most of the
demographic factors (data not shown).
In conclusion, our study suggests that gene-gene interactions
may occur between different pathophysiological pathways and a
significant three-way gene-gene interaction between GSTP1,
INSIG2 and IL4Ra on childhood asthma. Home dampness
combined with each one of the genes STAT6, IL13 and ADRB2
could also raise the asthma risk. Further classifying asthma into
different phenotypes and whole genome association genotyping
will improve the understanding of gene-gene interactions. The
MDR interaction model may work as a phenotype predictor based
on the genetic information to improve the clinical diagnosis.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
The study protocol was approved by the institutional review
board of National Taiwan University Hospital and complied with
the principles outlined in the Helsinki Declaration. All participants
gave written informed consent.
Study population
The study protocol was approved by the institutional review
board of National Taiwan University Hospital and complied with
the principles outlined in the Helsinki Declaration. TCHS
recruited 4,134 seventh-grade children from 14 diverse commu￾nities in Taiwan. The design and study protocol for the TCHS has
been published previously [50,54]. Information on childhood
exposure to indoor dampness and health status were collected with
a questionnaire, which was completed by the child’s parents or
guardians. In this study, a total of 3,810 children who provided
their oral mucosa were subjected for genotyping. All participating
children were arranged to measure height/weight and complete
pulmonary function tests with functional vital capacity (FVC),
forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and maximal mid￾expiratory flow (MMEF) recorded. The sex-specific percentage
predicted pulmonary function indices were estimated by using
linear regression models [55,56].
Definition of asthma
Children were considered to have asthma if there was an
affirmative answer to the question ‘‘Has a doctor ever diagnosed
this child as having asthma?’’ There were 235 asthmatic children
in our cohort. Family history of asthma or atopic diseases, and a
personal history of wheeze or bronchitis may affect asthma
susceptibility. With a proper consideration for non-asthmatic
selection, the control group in present study comprised of 1,075
children without wheeze, bronchitis, or family history of either
asthma or atopic disease.
Environmental exposure assessment
Environmental factors comprised in utero exposure to maternal
smoking (in utero ETS), preterm birth, pet ownership, cockroaches
in the home, household carpet use and environmental tobacco
smoke (ETS) at home. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as
weight/(height)2
[kg/m2
] and we categorized the study participants
into quartiles. The baseline questionnaire collected information on
several dampness indices at home. Home dampness was
established by an affirmative answer to one of following questions:
‘‘Have you had visible mould in the walls or bathroom in your
house in the past 12 months?’’; ‘‘Have you perceived mould odor
in the house during the past 12 months?’’ and ‘‘Have you
perceived wet stamps due to moisture in the ceilings, floors or walls
of your house during the past 12 months?’’.
DNA collection and genotyping
Genomic DNA was isolated from cotton swabs containing oral
mucosa using the phenol/chloroform extraction method [50,54].
All oral mucosa samples were stored at 280uC. The 17 single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were assessed by real-time
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the TaqMan Allelic
Discrimination (AD) assay on an ABI PRISMTM 7900 Sequence
Detector (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
Gene and Environment Interaction of Asthma
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 February 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 2 | e30694

Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis
The selected candidate genes were classified into three
categories: inflammatory genes, obesity-related genes, and anti￾oxidative genes. Gene-gene and gene-environment interactions
were detected by an open-source MDR software package [57,58].
MDR is a model-free and non-parametrical approach method that
can identify high dimensional gene-gene or gene-environment
interactions in a small population [57]. The combinations of
factors which provide the most information in high risk and low
risk group classification are suggested to be the most significant
gene-gene or gene-environment interactions. There are no
underlying assumptions about the independence or biological
relevance of SNPs or any other factor. Previous studies have
shown MDR to be a useful method for identifying gene-gene
interactions in high dimensional data [58].
The MDR algorithm determines one optimal model that can
successfully predict a high risk and low risk phenotype in a study
population. Subjects with missing values in any of the factors
should be deleted prior to data import. Firstly, the sample dataset
is divided into training and an independent testing sub dataset
for cross-validation. Cross-validation aims to avoid the model
over fitting problem. Secondly, an exhaustive search of a listed of
n genetic and environmental factors is performed. For example,
for two loci with three genotypes each, there are nine possible
combinations. Then, the case/control ratio for each combination
is counted. Finally, each combination is assigned as high risk or
low risk based on the comparison to the sample population case/
control ratio. If the case/control ratio of a multifactor
combination is higher than the original population, then this
combination is labeled as a high risk group and vice versa.
Multidimensional data are reduced to one dimension with two
classes via this rocess.
An MDR model with the best testing-balanced accuracy and
cross-validation consistency is selected. For example, in a 10-fold
cross-validation, the original dataset is divided into 10 subsets. The
maximum value of cross-validation consistency is 10 if the same
combination of factors is identified across all 10 subsets, and the
minimum value is 1. When the number of cases and controls are
not equal, balanced-accuracy weighs the classification accuracy of
the two classes equally, which is more powerful than using
accuracy alone. Testing balanced-accuracy is obtained from the
sum of true positive plus true negative divided by the total number
of samples in the testing dataset.
For those interaction models that showed higher testing￾balanced accuracy, we further used permutation tests, explicit
tests [59], and the likelihood ratio test (LRT) comparing a full
model that included an interaction term with a reduce model to
validate the MDR interaction results on childhood asthma. The
significant difference between high and low risk group on
childhood asthma was also validated by chi-square tests.
Furthermore, we used the entropy-based analysis included in the
MDR software package to determine whether the interactions are
synergistic or non-synergistic [60].
