Abstract
As the world is witnessing the epidemic of COVID-19, a disease caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, emerging 
genetics and clinical evidences suggest a similar path to those of SARS and MERS. The rapid genomic sequencing and open 
access data, together with advanced vaccine technology, are expected to give us more knowledge on the pathogen itself, 
including the host immune response as well as the plan for therapeutic vaccines in the near future. This review aims to pro￾vide a comparative view among SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly epidemic SARS-CoV-2, in the hope to gain a better 
understanding of the host-pathogen interaction, host immune responses, and the pathogen immune evasion strategies. 
This predictive view may help in designing an immune intervention or preventive vaccine for COVID-19 in the near future.

Introduction
The world experienced the outbreaks of coronavirus in￾fection that threaten global pandemic in 2002-2003 by Severe 
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and in 2011 by Middle 
East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). In both cases, the caus￾ative agents (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively) were 
newly identified coronavirus in the genus Betacoronavirus 
with zoonotic origin. At the end of 2019, outbreak of another 
coronavirus that causes respiratory-related illness was report￾ed in Wuhan, Hubei, China, a disease now officially called “the 
Corona Virus Disease 2019; COVID-19”. The coronavirus that 
is the causative agent of this respiratory disease was identified 
and its genome is fully sequenced.1
 The genomic sequence of 
SARS-CoV-2 showed similar, but distinct genome composition 
of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Since its first reported case in 
late 2019, the infection has spread to other regions in China 
and other countries, and the transmission rate, the mortality 
rate and the clinical manifestation slowly emerged. However, 
it will take months and maybe years until we will fully grasp 
the whole picture of the characteristics of the pathogens and 
its likely origin, symptoms and the host immune responses to 
combat the infection. 
With the rapid bedside-to-bench investigation, newly avail￾able tools such as next generation sequencing (NGS) and the 
open access information, key information on the clinical fea￾tures of the infected patients and the host immune responses 
started to accumulate for reconstructing the jigsaw puzzle of 
the epidemic piece by piece.2
 With its genome closely related 
to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and the accumulated clinical 
and experimental data on these previous viruses, one can hy￾pothesize and even predict how the host immune system may 
deal with this particular virus and how the virus may evade 
such host responses. This review focuses on the immunol￾ogy side of the infection using insights learned from the 
outbreak of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Based on the ac￾cumulated data and knowledge on the previous coronavirus 
infection, this review hopes to fill the knowledge gap on hu￾man immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection that may 
shed light on what may go wrong that leads to some fatalities.

This insight may help in designing the appropriate immune 
intervention for treatment and the prophylactic/therapeutic 
vaccines against current coronavirus. 
Host-Pathogen Interaction: Emerging Profiles of SARS-CoV-2 
Infection
Investigation of emerging pattern or transmission charac￾teristic of SAR-CoV-2 has surged after a burst of confirmed 
cases worldwide since December 2019. One of the initial re￾ports stated that most of the laboratory-confirmed infected 
patients (27 out of 41 cases) had links to Wuhan seafood mar￾ket.2
 Identification of the source or intermediate host of SAR￾CoV-2 were attempted, focusing on animals normally traded 
within the market including snakes, birds and other small 
mammals. However, to date, no specific animal association 
with SAR-CoV-2 has been conclusively identified. The most 
likely intermediate host candidate is thought to be pangolins as 
the coronavirus genetic sequences from the animals and from 
humans infected during the outbreak showed a 99% match, 
which was reported by the researchers at a press conference on 
February 7, 2020.3 
In parallel with intermediate host identification, a study in 
one family revealed that 6 patients who had travelled to Wu￾han, had no direct contact with the market. Moreover, one of 
the family members became infected even without a trip to 
Wuhan. The conclusion was that SAR-CoV-2 could be trans￾mitted from human-to-human, via respiratory droplets or 
close contact.4
 A larger study with 425 patients also confirmed 
human-to-human transmission in which most of the patients 
(200 out of 277) who were diagnosed during January 1–22, 2020, 
had never been exposed to either the Wuhan market or been 
in close contact with individuals with respiratory symptoms.5
According to the rapid spreading of SAR-CoV-2, WHO 
issued a public health emergency of international concern 
(PHEIC) alarm on January 30, 2020. As of February 20, 2020, 
a total of 75,725 confirmed cases were reported in at least 29 
countries worldwide with the fatality rate of 2.8% (2,126 out of
75,282 cases).6 Although the fatality rate is far lower than that 
of SARS (9.14%)7
 and MERS (34.4%),8
 the accumulated con￾firmed cases, within approximately 2 months after the out￾break, markedly exceeded SARS, (8,096 cases, since 2002) 
and MERS (2,494 cases, since 2012), see Figure 1. The high￾ly contagious nature of SAR-CoV-2 is probably due to the 
virus spreading via asymptomatic-infected individual which 
has been reported in Germany.9
 Moreover, mathematical 
models have estimated that the transmission that may occur 
during asymptomatic period of SARS-CoV and influenza were 
approximately 5% and 40%, respectively.10 Observation of 88 
cases diagnosed during January 20-28, 2020 from individ￾uals with travel history to Wuhan, found that the mean in￾cubation period ranged from 2.1 to 11.1 days (mean = 6.4 
days),11 which is similar to another study5
 and was in the same 
range with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.11 Longer incubation 
periods of up to 24 days was also reported12 but still under 
debate. WHO experts discussed during its press conference on 
February 10, 2020 that 24 days reported was either an outlier 
observation or could possibly be due to double exposure.13 
Identification of SARS-CoV-2 tropism is also warranted. 
In agreement with genome similarity with SARS, analysis of 
nucleic acid sequence within the spike protein receptor-bind￾ing domain (RBD) has been predicted that SAR-CoV-2 might 
also use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell 
receptor.14 The study performed in vitro experiments which 
could confirm that SAR-CoV-2 used ACE2 for cellular entry.15
Because wild range of animal species (except rat and mouse) 
express ACE2, it could support the observed cross-species and 
human-to-human transmission events. Demographic data and 
emerging characteristic of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SAR￾CoV-2 are summarized in Table 1. 
As SAR-CoV-2 is a novel human-infecting pathogen, re￾cent studies also attempted to define more accurate infection 
situation and to forecast the outbreak in the near future. By 
using a mathematical model to calculate the basic reproduc￾tive number, R0
, which is the average number of people that

one infected individual will pass the virus on to. If R0
 is high￾er than 1, continued transmission can occur. R0
 of SAR-CoV-2 
ranged from 2.2-2.6, with an epidemic doubling time of 6.4 
days.5,18 This implies that, in order to reduce R0
 below 1, more 
than half of the current infection must be prevented or con￾trolled.19 Comparing with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV which 
R0
 were < 1 and 1.4-2.5, respectively, it implies that SAR-CoV-2 
is more contagious than MERS-CoV and may cause an epidem￾ic or even a pandemic if transmission is uncontrolled. 
Immunopathology of COVID-19
The site of initial infection with SARS-CoV-2 is unknown 
and the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is still under investiga￾tion. For most patients, COVID-19 might affect only the lungs 
because it is mainly a respiratory disease. The primary mode 
of infection is human-to-human transmission through close 
contact, which occurs via spraying droplets from infected in￾dividual through their cough or sneeze. COVID-19 has a prob￾able asymptomatic incubation period between 2 and 14 days 
during which the virus can be transmitted.20 For this reason, 
the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has occurred with the basic 
R0
 of 2.2-2.6, meaning that on average each individual has the 
potential to spread the infection to 2.2 other people.1,21
Based on hospitalized patient data, the majority of COVID￾19 cases (about 80%) presented with asymptomatic or with 
mild symptoms while the remainder are severe or critical.2,4 It 
seems that the severity and fatality rate of COVID-19 are mild￾er than that of SARS and MERS. With similar clinical pre￾sentations as SARS and MERS, the most common symptoms 
of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue, and respiratory symptoms,

including cough, sore throat and shortness of breath. Although 
diarrhea was presented in about 20-25% of patients with 
SARS and MERS, intestinal symptoms were rarely reported 
in patients with COVID-19.1,2,4 Most patients also developed 
lymphopenia and pneumonia with characteristic pulmonary 
ground glass opacity changes on chest CT.1,2,4 In addition, the 
study of 41 hospitalized patients with high-levels of proinflam￾matory cytokines including IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, G-CSF, IP-10, 
MCP-1, MIP-1A, and TNFα were observed in the COVID-19 
severe cases.2
 These findings are in line with SARS and MERS 
in that the presence of lymphopenia and “cytokine storm” may 
have a major role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19.22-24 This 
so-called “cytokine storm” can initiate viral sepsis and inflam￾matory-induced lung injury which lead to other complications 
including pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome 
(ARDS), respiratory failure, shock, organ failure and poten￾tially death. Further autopsy or biopsy studies are necessary to 
understand more details of this disease.
At present, the mortality rate of COVID-19 worldwide is 
approximately 2.4% which are caused by multi-organ failure 
especially in elderly people and people with underlying health 
conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease and 
diabetes. 
Innate Immune Responses to SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Gaining 
Insight from Strategies used by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV
Currently, only limited information is available on the host 
innate immune status of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. In one 
report where 99 cases in Wuhan were investigated, increased 
total neutrophils (38%), reduced total lymphocytes (35%),

Figure 2. Proposed host immune responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection 
Aerosolized uptake of SARS-CoV-2 leads to infection of ACE2 expressing target cells such as alveolar type 2 cells or other unknown 
target cells. Virus may dampen anti-viral IFN responses resulting in uncontrolled viral replication. The influx of neutrophils and 
monocytes/macrophages results in hyperproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The immunopathology of lung may be the result 
of the “cytokine storms”. Specific Th1/Th17 may be activated and contributes to exacerbate inflammatory responses. B cells/plasma 
cells produce SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies that may help neutralize viruses. The question marks indicated events that are still 
speculative or unknown. Figure is made with biorender (https://biorender.com/).

T cells, a key feature in SARS-CoV-mediated pathogenesis.27
Whether SARS-CoV-2 infects any immune cells are still un￾known. Only minimal percentages of monocytes/macrophages 
in the lung expressed ACE2.26 If ACE2 is minimally expressed 
in the potential target immune cells, it is possible that other re￾ceptors may exist, or other cellular entry mode is utilized such 
as antibody-dependent enhancement (Figure 2). 
To mount an antiviral response, innate immune cells need 
to recognize the invasion of the virus, often by pathogen￾associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). For RNA virus such 
as coronavirus, it is known that PAMPs in the form of viral 
genomic RNA or the intermediates during viral replication in￾cluding dsRNA, are recognized by either the endosomal RNA 
receptors, TLR3 and TLR7 and the cytosolic RNA sensor, RIG-I/
MDA5. This recognition event leads to activation of the down￾stream signaling cascade, i.e. NF-κB and IRF3, accompanied 
by their nuclear translocation. In the nuclei, these transcrip￾tion factors induce expression of type I IFN and other pro-in￾flammatory cytokines and this initial responses comprise the 
first line defense against viral infection at the entry site.28
Type I IFN via IFNAR, in turn, activates the JAK-STAT path￾way, where JAK1 and TYK2 kinases phosphorylate STAT1 
and STAT2. STAT1/2 form a complex with IRF9, and together 
they move into the nucleus to initiate the transcription of
increased serum IL-6 (52%) and increased c-reactive protein 
(84%) were observed.25 In a separate report also from Wuhan, 
it revealed that in 41 patients, increased total neutrophils, de￾creased total lymphocytes in patients of ICU vs. non-ICU care 
were found to be statistically different. Increased neutrophils 
and decreased lymphocytes also correlate with disease sever￾ity and death.1
 Furthermore, patients needing ICU care had 
higher plasma levels of many innate cytokines, IP-10, MCP-1, 
MIP-1A, and TNFα.2
 These clinical features suggested the like￾lihood of involvement of highly pro-inflammatory condition 
in the disease progression and severity. This early high rise in 
the serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were also ob￾served in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection, suggesting a 
potential similar cytokine storm-mediated disease severity.23,24
Effective innate immune response against viral infection 
relies heavily on the interferon (IFN) type I responses and 
its downstream cascade that culminates in controlling viral 
replication and induction of effective adaptive immune re￾sponse. While SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 seem to share 
the entry receptor of ACE2, MERS-CoV uses dipeptidyl pep￾tidase (DPP)-4 as a specific receptor.25 The putative receptor 
of SARS-CoV-2, ACE2, is mainly expressed in a small subset 
of cells in the lung called type 2 alveolar cells.26 It has been 
reported that SARS-Co-V directly infects macrophages and

IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) under the control of IFN-stimu￾lated response element (ISRE) containing promoters.28 A suc￾cessful mounting of this type I IFN response should be able to 
suppress viral replication and dissemination at an early stage. 
For SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the response to viral in￾fection by type I IFN is suppressed. Both coronaviruses em￾ploy multiple strategies to interfere with the signaling leading 
to type I IFN production and/or the signaling downstream of 
IFNAR. This dampening strategy is closely associated with the 
disease severity.29 At the step of type I IFN induction, SARS￾CoV interferes with the signaling downstream of RNA sen￾sors directly or indirectly such as ubiquitination and degrada￾tion of RNA sensor adaptor molecules MAVS and TRAF3/6 
and inhibiting IRF3 nuclear translocation.30 MERS-CoV also 
utilizes some of these strategies with additional mechanism 
such as repressive histone modification.30 Once type I IFN is 
secreted, these two viruses are equipped with mechanism that 
inhibit IFN signaling such as decreasing STAT1 phosphory￾lation.28 The viral proteins involved in the modulation of this 
host type I IFN response are both structural proteins (such as 
M, N) and non-structural proteins (ORF proteins).
Based on the genomic sequence comparison, SARS-CoV 
shares overall genomic similarity with SARS-CoV or MERS￾CoV, approximately 79% and 50%, respectively. The genome 
of SARS-CoV-2 also contains additional gene regions (10b, 13, 
14). In addition, the amino acid sequences of some putative 
proteins of SARS-CoV-2 show only 68% similarity with that of 
SARS-CoV.14 Therefore, careful sequence comparison of each 
gene region may yield better prediction as how SARS-CoV-2 
interferes with host innate immune response. It is partially 
speculative that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes similar strategies to mod￾ulate the host innate immune response, especially in dampen￾ing the type I IFN response but additional novel mechanisms 
may be uncovered (Figure 2). 
In the severe or lethal cases of SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV 
infection, increased neutrophil and monocyte-macrophages 
influx are consistently observed.27,31 In a mouse model of SARS￾CoV infection, dysregulated type I IFN and inflammatory 
monocyte-macrophages are the main cause of lethal pneumo￾nia.29 Therefore, excessive type I IFN with the infiltrated my￾eloid cells are the main cause of lung dysfunction and neg￾atively impact the outcome of the infection. It is speculated 
that upon SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV infection, delayed type I 
IFN compromises the early viral control, leading to influx of 
hyperinflammatory neutrophils and monocytes-macrophages. 
The increases in these innate immune cells yields deteriorat￾ing consequences to infected host that manifested in lung im￾munopathology, including pneumonia or acute respiratory 
distress syndrome. In SARS-CoV-2 infection, similar scenar￾io is expected with varying degree of immune interference. 
Interestingly, transmission of virus is reported to occur even 
in asymptomatic infected individuals. This may be indicative 
of delayed early response of the innate immune response. 
Based on the accumulated data for previous coronavirus 
infection, innate immune response plays crucial role in pro￾tective or destructive responses and may open a window for 
immune intervention. Active viral replication later results 
in hyperproduction type I IFN and influx of neutrophils and 
macrophages which are the major sources of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines. With similar changes in total neutrophils and lym￾phocytes during COVID19, SARS-CoV-2 probably induces 
delayed type I IFN and loss of viral control in an early phase 
of infection. Individuals susceptible to CoVID19 are those with 
underlying diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, and car￾diovascular disease.2
 In addition, no severe cases were report￾ed in young children, when innate immune response is high￾ly effective. These facts strongly indicate that innate immune 
response is a critical factor for disease outcome. 
Based on the assumption that innate immunity plays a key 
role, several interventions can be proposed. Type I IFN, antag￾onists of some key pro-inflammatory cytokines and anti-viral 
agents are some of these examples. When using type I IFN for 
treatment, in a mouse model of either SARS-CoV or MERS￾CoV infection, the timing of administration is key to yield pro￾tective response.29
Adaptive Immune Responses: A Clue for Future Vaccine De￾velopment?
In general, the Th1 type immune response plays a domi￾nant role in an adaptive immunity to viral infections. Cytokine 
microenvironment generated by antigen presenting cells dic￾tate the direction of T cell responses. Helper T cells orchestrate 
the overall adaptive response, while cytotoxic T cells are essen￾tial in killing of viral infected cells. Humoral immune response, 
especially production of neutralizing antibody, plays a protec￾tive role by limiting infection at later phase and prevents re￾infection in the future. In SARS-CoV, both T and B cell epitopes 
were extensively mapped for the structural proteins, S, N, M 
and E protein.32 
SARS-CoV infection induces seroconversion as early as day 
4 after onset of disease and was found in most patients by 14 
days. Long lasting specific IgG and neutralizing antibody are 
reported as long as 2 years after infection.33 For MERS-CoV 
infection, seroconversion is seen at the second or third week 
of disease onset. For both types of coronavirus infections, 
delayed and weak antibody response are associated with se￾vere outcome.32 A limited serology details of SARS-CoV-2 
was reported. In a preliminary study, one patient showed peak 
specific IgM at day 9 after disease onset and the switching to 
IgG by week 2.25 Interestingly, sera from 5 patients of con￾firmed COVID-19 show some cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV, 
but not other coronavirus. Furthermore, all sera from patients 
were able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in an in vitro plaque as￾say, suggesting a possible successful mounting of the humoral 
responses.25 Whether the kinetic/titer of specific antibody cor￾relates with disease severity remains to be investigated. 
T cell response in SARS-CoV was extensively investigated. 
In one study using 128 convalescent samples, it was reported 
that CD8+ T cell responses were more frequent with greater 
magnitude than CD4+ T cell responses. Furthermore, the vi￾rus specific T cells from the severe group tended to be a cen￾tral memory phenotype with a significantly higher frequency 
of polyfunctional CD4+ T cells (IFNγ, TNFα, and IL-2) and 
CD8+ T cells (IFNγ, TNFα and degranulated state), as com￾pared with the mild-moderate group. Strong T cell responses 
correlated significantly with higher neutralizing antibody while 
more serum Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-10) were detected 
in the fatal group.34 For the epitope mapping, most responses

human immune responses. This partly explains why they tend 
to have a longer incubation period, 2-11 days on average com￾pared to influenza, 1-4 days.37 The longer incubation period is 
probably due to their immune evasion properties, efficiently 
escaping host immune detection at the early stage of infection. 
As a member of the Betacoronavirus genus, immune evasion 
mechanism is potentially similar to those of SARS-CoV and 
MERS-CoV. The mechanisms of how SARS-CoV and MERS￾CoV modulate host immune responses were extensively re￾viewed and discussed (Figure 3).30,38,39 In brief, most mech￾anisms rely on the inhibition of innate immune responses, 
especially type I interferon recognition and signaling. The vi￾ral proteins including membrane (M) or nonstructural (NS) 
proteins (eg. NS4a, NS4b, NS15) are the key molecules in host 
immune modulation. In agreement with the aforementioned 
study, analysis of two MERS-CoV-infected individuals with 
different severity found that the type I interferon response in 
the poor outcome (death) patient was remarkably lower than 
the recovered patient.40 For adaptive immune evasion, antigen 
presentation via MHC class I and MHC class II was downreg￾ulated when the macrophages or dendritic cells were infect￾ed with MERS-CoV, which would markedly diminish T cells 
activation.38 
Prophylactic Vaccines: Is it possible? 
Due to the rapid increase of SAR-CoV-2 infections and 
affected countries, efforts toward developing an effective SAR￾CoV-2 vaccine have been ignited in many countries. By gaining 
Figure 3. Potential immune evasion mechanisms shared by SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
Coronaviruses interfere with multiple steps during initial innate immune response, including RNA sensing (1 and 2), signaling 
pathway of type I IFN production (3), STAT1/2 activation downstream of IFN/IFNAR (4) as indicated by suppressive marks. This 
delayed or dampening type I IFN responses impinge upon adaptive immune activation. Prolonged viral persistence exacerbates 
inflammatory responses that may lead to immune exhaustion and immune suppression as a feedback regulatory mechanism. 
Biased Th2 type response also favors poor outcome of the disease.

(70%) were found against the structural proteins (spike, enve￾lope, membrane, and nucleocapsid). In MERS-CoV infection, 
early rise of CD8+ T cells correlates with disease severity and 
at the convalescent phase, dominant Th1 type helper T cells 
are observed.35 In an animal model, airway memory CD4+ T 
cells specific for conserved epitope are protective against lethal 
challenge and can cross react with SARS-CoV and MERS￾CoV.36 As neutrophils play a destructive role in all infections, 
the protective or destructive role of Th17 in human coronavirus 
infection remains unanswered. 
Current evidences strongly indicated that Th1 type re￾sponse is a key for successful control of SARS-CoV and MERS￾CoV and probably true for SARS-CoV-2 as well. CD8+ T cell 
response, even though crucial, needs to be well controlled in 
order not to cause lung pathology. Because most epitopes 
identified for both viruses concentrate on the viral structural 
proteins, it will be informative to map those epitopes identi￾fied with SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV with those of SARS-CoV-2. 
If overlapping epitopes among the three viruses can be identi￾fied, it will be beneficial for application in passive immunization 
using convalescent serum from recovered SARS or MERS pa￾tients. For T cell epitopes, it will help in designing cross reactive 
vaccine that protect against all three human coronaviruses in 
the future. 
Potential Immune Evasion Mechanisms

from Zika, in order to speed up the available vaccine during 
ongoing outbreak, preclinical studies of SAR-CoV-2 vaccine 
candidates may need to be performed in parallel with clinical 
trials. However, before entering clinical testing, the regulatory 
agencies must assess the production process and preclinical 
information to ensure volunteers’ safety.49 
By looking at the similarities and differences between the 
current SARS-CoV-2 and the previous outbreak of SARS and 
MERS, a striking similarity emerges with some unique fea￾tures of its own. As the COVID-19 causes serious public health 
concerns across Asia and on the blink to affect world popula￾tion, investigation into the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, its 
interaction with the host immune responses may help provide 
a clearer picture of how the pathogen causes diseases in some 
individuals while most infected people only show mild or no 
symptoms at all. In addition, the study of the immune correlates 
of protection and the long-term immune memory from conva￾lescent individuals may help in design prophylactic and thera￾peutic measures for future outbreak of similar coronaviruses.

knowledge from SARS and MERS vaccines development path, 
several research groups have been able to start SAR-CoV-2 
vaccine development within only a few weeks after the out￾break. The target antigen selection and vaccine platform are 
probably based on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV vaccine stud￾ies, summarized in Table 2. Full-length spike (S) or S1 which 
contains receptor binding domain (RDB) might be considered 
as a good vaccine antigen because it could induce neutralizing 
antibodies that prevent host cell attachment and infection.41-43
Table 2 describes the selected antigens and platforms that 
have been tested for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in clinical and 
preclinical studies. 
Interestingly, as summarized in the Table 2, nucleic acid￾based vaccine, DNA vaccine, showed the most advance plat￾form in response to emerging pathogens. Moreover, during 
Zika virus outbreak, DNA vaccine was the first vaccine can￾didate that entered clinical trial (NCT02809443)44 (less than 
1-year after the outbreak). According to the current technolog￾ical advancement, mRNA vaccine, another nucleic acid-based 
vaccine, has been considered as disruptive vaccine technology. 
Recent mRNA vaccine designs have improved stability and 
protein translation efficiency thus it could induce robust im￾mune responses.45,46 Delivery system such as lipid nanoparticle, 
LNP was also well-optimized.47 
Within two months of the SAR-CoV-2 outbreak, at least 
37 biopharmaceutical companies or academic sectors are in 
the race to develop the prophylactic vaccine by using sever￾al platforms including mRNA, DNA, adenoviral vector and
