35 Abstract
36 Objectives: To examine the role and outcomes of all interventions for aortic stenosis in 
37 children, with focus on freedom from reintervention and the aim to minimise prosthetic aortic 
38 valve replacement (pAVR) during childhood.
39 Methods: Retrospective analysis of 194 consecutive children who underwent any aortic 
40 valve intervention for a biventricular repair strategy at a single institution between 1995-
41 2017. Data were obtained from hospital records and follow-up was 100% complete.
42 Results: Over a 22-year period, 194 children underwent total 313 aortic valve procedures: 
43 Primary interventions were surgical valvotomy (SV)/surgical repair (SR) in 94 (48.5%),
44 balloon valvuloplasty (BV) in 60 (30.9%), pAVR in 8 (4.1%) and Ross/Ross-Konno 
45 procedure in 32 (16.5%). Median age at first intervention was 1.1 years (IQR 0.1-9.4) and 
46 varied with type of intervention: SV/SR were most common in neonates (33, 75%) and 
47 infants (35, 68%), whilst BV was most frequent in older children (42, 42%). Operative 
48 survival was 99% (2 early deaths, both in neonates with critical aortic stenosis and poor left 
49 ventricular function) and 15-year survival was 95%. A Ross procedure was performed in 79
50 (40.7%) patients over the 15-year study period, one of whom required late pAVR for 
51 autograft failure. Freedom from any reintervention after SV/SR and BV was 41% and 40% at 
52 10 years, compared to 90% at 10 years with the Ross procedure (p<0.001). Amongst neonatal 
53 SV/SR and BV, 98% required reintervention during childhood with no difference between 
54 groups. Valve morphology did not influence freedom from ultimate valve replacement. In 
55 patients who went on to have a Ross procedure, median time from initial intervention to Ross 
56 was 2.8 years (IQR 0.1-11.9) in neonates and 6.0 years (IQR 3.1-7.5) in all other age groups. 
57 Overall freedom from pAVR was 97% at 10 years and was similar in the SV/SR and BV 
58 groups.

59 Conclusion: A strategy of simple valve repair and primary Ross procedure provides excellent 
60 survival and good freedom from pAVR. However, reintervention rates after simple 
61 interventions for congenital AS are high, especially in younger age groups. The Ross 
62 procedure offers the best freedom from reintervention of any technique and wider use of 
63 primary Ross in younger age groups should be considered

69 Perspective statement: Combination of simple repair techniques and the Ross procedure 
70 provide excellent survival for congenital aortic stenosis and minimise the need for prosthetic
71 aortic valve replacement in children. Wider use of the Ross procedure could reduce the 
72 burden of aortic valve reintervention during childhood.

74 Introduction
75 Congenital aortic stenosis (AS) in children presents a significant challenge due to variability 
in clinical presentation and commonly requires a series of interventions during childhood1
76 . 
77 Optimal management of symptomatic patients with AS still remains controversial; however, 
78 in majority of scenarios it consists of the first line treatment that can be either balloon 
valvuloplasty (BV) or surgical valvulotomy (SV)1–3
79 with destination interventions most 
commonly being the Ross procedure4–7
, prosthetic aortic valve replacement (pAVR)
8–10 80 or 
surgical aortic valve (AoV) reconstruction 8,10–12 81 . The choice and timing of ultimate 
destination for the AoV is also a matter of ongoing debate13 82 . Recent reports show that AoV 
substitute with autograft is superior to pAVR14 83 , despite being criticised for its complexity, 
84 risks of autograft dilatation and right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) reoperation. In 
85 contrast, three-cusp reconstruction techniques are an attractive alternative to any AoV
86 replacement, but with concerns over limited long-term durability and performance of leaflet 
87 material and suitability in younger children.
88
89 The aim of this study was to analyse the clinical outcomes for patients presenting with 
90 congenital AS, the burden of reinterventions with each pathway, and the roles of BV, SV and 
91 primary Ross procedure in providing long-term freedom from prosthetic AoV replacement.
92 Outcomes were analysed not only in terms of survival but also freedom from reintervention 
93 with each treatment strategy.

95 Material and methods
96 All patients presenting with a primary diagnosis of AS between 1995-2017 were included in 
97 the study. All patients were treated at a single institution (Birmingham Children’s Hospital, 
98 United Kingdom). The start date was chosen as this was when all hospital records and 
99 imaging data became established in the hospital digital database to enable accurate review of 
100 original data. This study was registered with the Institution’s Research & Development 
101 office; however, in accordance with UK NHS National Research Ethics Service guidance, 
102 neither individual informed consent not formal research ethics committee review was 
103 required as the study was undertaken by the direct clinical care team using information 
104 previously collected in the course of routine care.
105
106 Patients were only included in the study if they underwent biventricular repair. Patients with 
107 associated ventricular septal defect, mitral valve disease and the coarctation of the aorta were
108 also included into the study. Patients with predominant AoV regurgitation were excluded. 
109 Neonatal period was defined as an age from birth to 28 days inclusive with infancy as an age 
110 between 28 days and one year and childhood until 18 years old. Follow up was complete to 
111 September 2018, obtained from hospital electronic patient records (HeartSuite, Systeria, 
112 Glasgow, United Kingdom) and through structured enquiry with referring cardiac surgeons or 
113 cardiologists when patients has been transferred to another institution.
114
115 A bicuspid aortic valve was defined as either a truly bileaflet, bicommissural valve or a 
116 functionally bicuspid valve with a completely fused false commissure. The first interventions 
117 were defined as any initial AoV procedures performed after the diagnosis of AS was 
118 established and included the following interventions: surgical valvotomy (SV), surgical repair
119 (SR), balloon valvuloplasty (BV), Ross/Ross-Konno procedure, or pAVR. The choice of BV 

9
120 vs SV/SR was made by a multi-disciplinary decision but with a strong institutional bias 
121 towards surgical intervention in neonates (see below). This reflects the institutional 
122 preference for SV in neonates to create a controlled opening of the valve and minimise the 
123 risk of creating aortic regurgitation. Our operative technique for SV has been described 
previously12 124 and involves opening up of fused commissures, thinning of the leaflets and 
125 excision of nodules and areas of thickening on the aortic leaflets. Policy was to achieve a 
126 peak velocity across the valve at completion of at least less than <30mmHg. In this study, 
127 surgical repair (SR) was defined as performing valvotomy as described above, but with the 
128 addition of a single patch (of bovine pericardium) to re-create a single commissure or part of 
129 an unsupported leaflet. Multiple AoV leaflet extensions and three leaflet reconstruction 
130 techniques were not used throughout the time of the study as an institutional preference. The 
131 Ross procedure was preferred for any valves requiring more than a single patch commissural 
repair. Our current technique for the Ross procedure has also been described previously7
132 and 
133 was performed as root replacement without external prosthetic support.
134
135 Statistical methods
136 Exploratory analyses incorporating graphical and tabular displays assessed evidence in favour 
137 of trends and associations. Data that is skewed is presented as median and interquartile range. 
138 Categorical data are expressed as counts and percentages where appropriate. 
139
140 Overall survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The log rank test was used to 
141 compare survival and re-intervention between subgroups. R version 3.5.3 was used for the 
142 analysis and packages for survival, survminer and ggplot2 along with those in the base 
143 version were used for presenting data and for analysis. Significance testing was 2-sided with 
144 the significance level set at p<0.05.

145 Results
146 A total of 194 patients with a primarily diagnosis of AS underwent 313 AoV interventions 
147 between 1995 and 2017, of whom 141 (72.7%) were male. The median weight at the first 
148 intervention was 9.7kg (IQR 4.0-31.4) and median age 1.1 years (IQR 0.1-9.4). Initial valve 
149 morphology was bicuspid in 144 (74.2%) patients, trileaflet in 41 (21.1%) and unicuspid in 
150 two (1.0%), with no quadricuspid aortic valves identified; in seven (3.6%) cases, valve 
151 morphology could not be defined, all of whom had undergone initial balloon intervention.
152 The average number of AoV interventions was 1.6 per patient with 59 (30.4%) patients 
153 undergoing two interventions, 22 (11.3%) with three interventions, 4 (2.1%) with four 
154 interventions, and one (0.5%) with five interventions. At first intervention, 44 (22.7%) were 
155 neonates, 51 (26.3%) were infants, and 99 (51.0%) were children; median age at first 
156 intervention in children was 9.0 years (IQR 3.9-13.7). Procedures were performed by or 
157 under the supervision of 7 Consultant interventional cardiologists and 6 Consultant surgeons, 
158 all of whom performed Ross procedures. A flow diagram of primary and subsequent aortic 
159 valve interventions in this cohort, including the number of prosthetic AVR/root replacements 
160 and Ross procedures by primary intervention, is shown in the graphical abstract (figure 8).
161
162 The overall survival was 95% at 15 years (Figure 1A), with a hospital mortality of 1.0%; only 
163 two hospital deaths occurred, both in the neonatal group in the setting of severely impaired 
164 ventricular function. One patient presented with critical AS and underwent SV, then, due to 
165 inadequate AS relief, the Ross-Konno procedure was performed on postoperative day 21. The 
166 patient died of intractable heart failure on postoperative day 23. The second case had 
167 persistent poor LV function and low cardiac output state after urgent SV, despite good relief 
168 of gradient and no aortic incompetence, and died on postoperative day 12. Late mortality was 
169 3.1%, with six late non-procedural deaths, with the causes as follows: chronic heart failure in 

11
170 a patient who died at age 2.8 years after initial SV twice in neonatal period; late infective 
171 endocarditis after pAVR in a patient with Shone complex and severe pulmonary hypertension 
172 at age 8.4 years; respiratory failure in context of multiply birth anomalies after good surgical
173 result and two lost to follow up 12 y after SV and 3 months after BV. The cause of death in 
174 last patient was unknown, a sudden death at home at age 2.4 years with documented good 
175 heart function, no residual AoV stenosis but moderate regurgitation after neonatal SV.
176
177 Median time of follow-up was 12.4 years (11 days to 28.1 years) and was 100 % complete.
178
179 First AoV intervention
180 The most common initial AoV intervention was SV/SR performed in 94 (48.5%) patients 
181 followed by BV as the second most common AoV intervention in 60 (30.9%) patients. 
182 Primary Ross/Ross-Konno procedure was performed in 32 (16.5%) cases and pAVR required 
183 in 8 (4.1%) patients. The spectrum of age at first AoV intervention is presented in Figure 2.
184 Median age at first intervention was 1.1 years (IQR 0.1-9.4) and varied with type of 
185 intervention: surgical repair was the most frequent primary intervention in neonates (33, 
186 75%) and infants (35, 68%), whilst BV was the most common in older children (42, 42%).
187 The institutional preference for SV (or repair) in neonates is clearly shown in Figure 2 with 
188 85% of neonates undergoing surgery compared to 15% having BV as the first intervention.
189
190 The median age at primary pAVR was 15.4 years (IQR 13.5-16.0), all of which were 
191 mechanical valves (St Jude, Abbott Cardiovascular, Minnesota). The indications for choosing
192 pAVR over Ross procedure in these 8 patients were: patient preference in 3, dilated aortic 
193 root with aortopathy in 3, abnormal pulmonary valve in 1, and unfavourable anatomy in 1 

12
194 (LAD passing around the annulus of the pulmonary valve). The freedom from pAVR was 
195 95% at 10 years and 88% at 15 years in the entire cohort as shown in Figure 1B.
196
197 Freedom from prosthetic AVR: In total 21 (10.8%) patients required pAVR including 8
198 (4.1%) cases as a primary pAVR. One patient required pAVR due to autograft failure at 14.5 
199 years after primary Ross procedure. The other reasons for pAVR were mainly due to non￾200 feasibility of the Ross procedure in 16 (80%) cases and patient choice in 4 (20%). The 
201 instances when we performed pAVR were as follows: abnormal pulmonary valve in 7 (30%)
202 cases, aortopathy with ascending aorta dilatation in 5 (25%), and deteriorated clinical 
203 condition due to renal failure in one (5%) patient. Primary Ross/Ross-Konno procedure
204 provided the highest freedom from subsequent pAVR compared with other primary AoV 
205 interventions (100 % vs 94 % in BV group and 93 % in SV/SR group at 10 years, p=0.5)
206 (Figure 3).
207
208 The Ross/Ross-Konno procedures were used constantly throughout the study period across a 
209 wide age range, as shown in Figure 2. 79 (40.7%) patients underwent the Ross procedure, 32
210 as a primary procedure (ie, as their first intervention) and 47 as a secondary procedure (i.e.
211 after one or more previous AoV interventions). The median age at primary Ross was 8.3
212 (IQR 3.0-11.2) years and at secondary Ross was 7.0 (IQR 2.6-12.5) years. There was zero 
213 mortality amongst the primary Ross group, and one death in the secondary Ross group, as 
214 described above in a critically ill neonate.
215
216 Primary Ross procedure, SV/SR and BV and were equally good in protecting from ultimate 
217 pAVR, noting that there was 100% freedom from need for pAVR in the primary Ross 
218 procedure group at 10 years (Figure 3).

13
219
220 Subsequent AoV interventions
221 Median time between interventions was 2.5 years (1 day to 15 years). Freedom from 
222 reintervention with respect to age at original procedure is shown in Figure 4. In neonatal 
223 groups of SV/SR and BV, freedom from subsequent AoV intervention was 47% and 43 % at 
224 1 year. When the first intervention was performed in infancy, the freedom from subsequent 
225 reintervention was 61% in the SV/SR group compared to 78% with BV at 5 years (p=ns). 
226 Finally, when the first intervention was at an age older than 1 year, freedom from subsequent 
227 reintervention after SV/SR or BV were 81% and 63% at 5 years, respectively (p=ns). The 
228 results again emphasise that neonatal interventions (whether SV/SR or BV) are associated 
229 with higher reintervention rates and shorter time to reintervention than in the older age
230 groups. More detailed analysis of the time spent in each intervention state showed that there 
231 was no difference in the sequence or duration of freedom from reinterventions when 
232 comparing BV with SV/SR (supplementary figure). Of the 94 patients who underwent initial 
233 SV/SR, 34 (35%) had a subsequent Ross procedure, 8 (8%) had BV, 5 (5%) had repeated SV, 
234 4 (4%) had pAVR, and 3 (3%) have undergone aortic root replacement . In the BV group, 33 
235 (55%) patients required one or more subsequent AoV interventions and by the time they 
236 reached adulthood, the most recent procedure was the Ross procedure in 13 (22%), SV in 8 
237 (13%), repeated BV in 5 (8%) and pAVR in 5 (8%) patients. BV was avoided if there was 
238 >mild regurgitation or if the morphology of the valve suggested fused commissures that were 
239 good targets for surgical valvotomy. 
240
241 Amongst all patients who underwent neonatal ‘repair’ procedures (SV/SR or BV) almost all
242 required at least one further reintervention during childhood. Freedom from ultimate AoV
243 replacement (whether autograft or prosthetic) is shown in Figure 5, comparing those who 

14
244 require initial neonatal intervention with those whose first intervention was beyond the 
245 neonatal period; 15-year freedom from valve replacement (either Ross or pAVR) was 3% in 
246 the neonatal group compared to 39% in the older age groups (p<0.003) (Figure 5).
247
248 Comparison of balloon valvuloplasty and surgical repair/valvotomy in terms of freedom from 
249 any type of AoV replacement (Ross or pAVR) is shown in Figure 6A. Taking all age-groups 
250 together, initial BV provided improved freedom from AoV replacement when compared to 
251 initial surgery (p=0.005), but did not show any benefit in freedom from overall reintervention 
252 (Figure 4). This potential benefit of BV is mainly within the older patients, as shown when 
253 comparing to Figure 4 where the outcomes within neonates for both BV and SV/SR were 
254 similar. Surgical valvotomy and repair, when performed in neonatal period as primary AoV 
255 procedures, were associated with significantly lower freedom from subsequent AoV 
256 intervention (25% at 5 years, p<0.001) compared with infant and children (65% and 80% at 5 
257 years, respectively). In neonates who underwent primary BV, the numbers were small, and it 
258 did not reach statistical significance (p=0.10). Overall, 97% of all neonatal SV/SR and BV
259 required subsequent reintervention during childhood.
260
261 The impact of valve morphology on the need for valve replacement is shown in Figure 6B.
262 Bicuspid/unicuspid AoV morphology did not influence the freedom from AoV replacement 
263 when compared to trileaflet valves.
264
265 Ross Procedure: Ross procedure was performed in 79 (40.7%) patients over the study 
266 period. Freedom from any AoV intervention in the entire group of Ross/Ross-Konno 
267 procedure was 90% at 10 years, which was significantly better outcome (p<0.001) compared 
268 with reintervention rates in BV and SV/SR groups where the freedom from any AoV 

15
269 intervention was 40% and 41% at 10 years, respectively (Figure 7A). Analysis of the patients 
270 that ultimately received the Ross procedure showed that the mean time between initial 
271 intervention and the Ross procedure was 6.1 years with a mean of 1.5 interventions prior to 
272 the Ross procedure. The median time from initial intervention to the Ross procedure also 
273 depended on the age at first intervention: if the first intervention was in childhood, median 
274 time to Ross procedure was 5.2 years (IQR 2.8-8.9), if during infancy, median time was 6.3
275 years (IQR 3.1-6.7) and if performed as a neonate, median time was 2.8 years (IQR 0.0-13.4).
276
277 The need for surgical reintervention on the RVOT amongst the entire Ross procedure cohort 
278 was 7 conduit replacements in 6 (7.7%) patients over the duration of the study. Freedom from 
279 surgical RVOT reintervention is shown in Figure 7B, with a freedom from conduit 
280 replacement of 88% at 10 years.

282 Discussion
283 The management of congenital AS in children is a challenging task due to a lack of well￾established guidelines, heterogeneity in practice and various patterns of presentation15 284 . The 
285 initial treatment strategy remains an area of debate but evidence suggests that both BV and 
286 SV as primary intervention in neonates and infants yields equivalent results in terms of 
survival1
287 and also, it is commonly accepted that they are palliative procedures in the sense 
that the majority of patients will come to need further intervention in the future2
288 . In 
289 contemporary series, freedom from AoV reintervention after AoV surgery in the paediatric 
290 population ranges between 50% and 80% at 10 years, with a median time to next AoV 
reintervention between 4 and 6 years8–10,12 291 . Freedom from reintervention was only 33% at 10 
years for AS with a bileaflet AoV phenotype12 292 . Similarly, initial BV provides freedom from 
subsequent AoV intervention between 30% and 50% at 10 years,2,3,16,17 293 most commonly due 
294 to significant AoV regurgitation. These outcomes are generally accepted, given that the aim 
295 of BV and SV is to delay the need for subsequent AoV substitute until the child is grown 
sufficiently2
296 . In general, studies have focused on the outcomes for critical AS in the neonatal 
297 period, and there is limited data on the relative benefits/performance of BV vs SV in older 
298 age groups within childhood. This study highlights the overall burden of reinterventions 
299 within this population and describes similar high reintervention rates in the neonatal 
300 population, with 97% of cases requiring further surgical intervention during childhood. 
301
302 An important component of this study is our institutional policy regarding initial AoV 
303 interventions which has evolved to strongly favour surgical valvotomy in neonates. The 
304 rationale is that this is felt to be more a more controlled procedure with less risk of significant 
305 AoV regurgitation, which can be difficult to manage in neonates. Beyond the neonatal 
306 period, we would still favour surgical valvotomy when AoV presented with at least two well-

17
307 defined commissures while BV would be reserved for the more dysplastic AoV with poorly 
308 defined commissures, or as a second line intervention for those patients who had previous 
309 SV. Therefore, surgical valvotomy was the most common procedure in neonates (33, 75%) 
310 and infants (35, 68%) whilst BV was more frequent in older children (42, 42%). This study 
311 has shown that using this selective policy can yield very encouraging outcomes, with 98% 
312 survival at 15 years across the entire spectrum of AS (excluding univentricular circulations).
313 This study cannot tell us whether SV or BV is preferable in neonates due to the small 
314 numbers of patients in the BV group, only that a policy of favouring surgery appears to be 
315 safe and provides excellent survival.
316
317 Given that such good survival can be achieved, the focus becomes more on the burden of 
318 reinterventions in this patient group and whether there may be ways of minimising 
319 reintervention. This study reinforced the finding that almost all patients who require neonatal 
320 intervention will come to need eventual AoV replacement during childhood. However, in 
321 older patients (first intervention during or after infancy) the story is not the same, and it 
322 would be expected that two-thirds of all infants and children will require some reintervention, 
323 and only half will need AoV replacement during childhood. An important observation from 
324 this study is that, beyond the neonatal period, freedom from eventual AoV replacement (Ross
325 procedure or pAVR) was improved (p=0.05) in BV group compared with SV group; 
326 however, this may reflect our selective policy of reserving BV for the older age-groups and 
327 its use as a secondary procedure subsequent to initial SV. Although BV appeared to reduce 
328 the need for eventual valve replacement in these older children, the need for reintervention 
329 was similar to the SV group.
330

331 In the current literature there are few studies which directly compare BV and SV in neonates 
and infants2,3
. Siddiqui et al3
332 reported outcome in 123 infants and neonates who underwent 
333 BV and SR for critical AoS. Surgical valvotomy was associated with a significantly higher 
334 freedom from next AoV intervention when compared to BV (27% vs 65% at 5 years). In 
contrast, Benson et al2
335 reported comparable long-term outcomes in 79 neonates undergoing 
336 BV or SV; freedom from re-intervention in the BV group was 52% versus 78% for SV at 5 
337 years, but this was not significant (p =0.09). This study shows comparable outcomes between 
338 BV and SV in neonates, but the small numbers in the BV group prohibit any further analysis 
339 beyond this observation.
340
341 In managing congenital AS, a key aim is to avoid the need for pAVR during childhood 
342 whenever possible. In this study, we found that a 96% freedom from pAVR can be achieved 
343 at 10 years using the combination approach of simple SV, BV and the Ross procedure. 
344 Mechanical pAVR has generally been reserved for children with AoV disease who are not 
good candidates for the Ross procedure or for valve-sparing AoV surgery4
345 , but in many 
studies it is still used as the definitive AoV substitute18,19 346 , despite the disadvantages of poorer 
347 haemodynamics that the Ross procedure, the issue of no growth potential and significant 
348 morbidity related to the need for lifelong anticoagulation. In contrast, the Ross procedure is 
349 the preferred AoV substitute in children as it offers growth potential, excellent 
hemodynamics and avoids the risk of anticoagulation15 350 in spite of being criticized for its 
complexity, risks related to autograft dilatation5,6 351 and the need for RVOT reinterventions. The 
352 Ross/Ross-Konno procedure also has the advantage that it can be used at any age, including 
353 neonates and that it retains full growth potential regardless of the age at which it is 
354 performed. An important observation within this study is the remarkable freedom from the 
355 need for any reintervention on the AoV following the Ross procedure (whether primary or 

19
356 secondary), which is considerably better than that seen with SV/SR or BV. Thus, in terms of 
357 minimising the burden of reintervention on the AoV, there could be an argument for wider 
358 use of the Ross procedure, especially in the younger age groups where there is an extremely 
359 high likelihood of coming to need valve replacement during childhood. This argument is 
360 strengthened by evidence that the Ross procedure performed at a younger age has extremely 
361 good long-term performance with a lower incidence of autograft dilatation and better long￾term preservation of autograft function7
362 . This creates a potential dilemma in the younger 
363 patient as the Ross/Ross-Konno procedure is a major and complex procedure and the use of a 
364 simpler SV or even BV can be very appealing. Having said this, the operative outcomes of 
365 the Ross procedure in infants, particularly in the setting of good ventricular function, are 
366 extremely good and would support a strategy of wider use of the Ross procedure in younger 
367 patients. The attraction of such a strategy might not only reduce the burden of AoV 
368 reinterventions but may also preserve better long-term left ventricular function by avoiding 
369 interim periods with sub-optimal haemodynamic between multiple interventions.
370
371 This argument must be balanced by the potential drawbacks of the Ross procedure, which 
include the likely need for right sided conduit interventions4,6 372 and a recognised failure rate 
373 and dilatation of the autograft. However, the need for surgical RVOT reintervention was low 
374 in this study despite many patients being in younger age groups (88% freedom at 10 years), 
375 and the use of homografts for RVOT reintervention in the setting of the Ross procedure have 
376 traditionally performed extremely well.
377
378 The biggest challenge in management of congenital AS is to better predict which patients are 
379 likely to come to need AoV replacement and which are likely to do well with simple repair 
380 (BV or SV), or at least to be able to identify the group who are likely to get good mid-long 

20
381 term palliation with simple repair. This may help us to design treatment models favouring
382 earlier Ross procedure in certain patient groups.
383
384 Limitations of the study
385 As an observational study, our institutional bias towards using SV in neonates and BV in 
386 older patients limits an objective comparison between techniques by age group. The 
387 retrospective nature of the study and the variability in pre-operative characteristics limits the 
388 capability to objectively compare SV to Ross as there are too many compounding variables –
389 a randomised prospective study would be needed to examine this. Only patients who 
390 underwent a biventricular repair were included and as such, our results do not reflect the 
391 outcomes of all neonates with critical aortic stenosis. Some patients underwent multiple BV 
392 or SV procedures, including cross-over between groups, which makes subsequent analysis of 
393 outcomes more clouded. As follow-up was limited to childhood, this study does not address 
394 the late freedom from pAVR, performance of the Ross autograft or need for RVOT 
395 reintervention into adulthood. In addition, there was missing data on valve morphology in 
396 seven (3.6%) cases.
397
398 This study did not attempt to evaluate the role of more complex AoV reconstructive 
399 procedures; we have avoided these procedures in children due to concerns over the durability 
of the techniques and materials used,8
400 although we acknowledge that there has been renewed 
interest in these procedures with greater success of the Ozaki procedure20 401 , even in younger 
children21 402 . This may become an additional option in managing the pathway of congenital AS, 
403 although are still less likely to be offered in the younger age group, where the controversy 
404 over the best strategy is greatest.

406 Conclusion
407 A combined approach of simple valvotomy/repair, judicious use of balloon valvuloplasty and 
408 the Ross procedure can provide excellent outcomes in congenital AS and minimise the need 
409 for pAVR during childhood. There is a considerable burden of reintervention, particularly in 
410 patients needing neonatal intervention, who have a 97% likelihood of needing valve 
411 replacement during childhood. The Ross procedure carries the lowest need for reintervention 
412 of any treatment modality, and wider use of the primary Ross in the younger age-group 
413 should be considered.
