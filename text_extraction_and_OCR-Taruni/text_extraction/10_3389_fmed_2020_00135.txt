Background: Machine perfusion (MP) and static cold storage (CS) are two
prevalent methods for liver allograft preservation. However, the preferred method
remains controversial.
Aim: To conduct a meta-analysis on the impact of MP preservation on liver
transplant outcome.
Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were systematically
searched to identify relevant trials comparing the efficacy of MP vs. CS. Odds ratios (OR)
and fixed-effects models were calculated to compare the pooled data.
Results: Ten prospective cohort studies and two randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) were included (MP livers vs. CS livers = 315:489). Machine perfusion
demonstrated superior outcomes in posttransplantation aspartate aminotransferase
levels compared to CS (P < 0.05). The overall incidence of early allograft dysfunction
(EAD) was significantly reduced with MP preservation than CS [OR = 0.46; 95%
confidence interval (CI) = 0.31–0.67; P < 0.0001]. The incidence of total biliary
complications (OR = 0.53; 95% CI = 0.34–0.83; P = 0.006) and that of ischemic
cholangiopathy (OR = 0.39; 95% CI = 0.18–0.85; P = 0.02) were significantly
lower in recipients with MP preservation compared with CS preservation. Hypothermic
machine perfusion (HMP) but not normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) was
found to significantly protect grafts from total biliary complications and ischemic
cholangiopathy (P < 0.05). However, no significant differences could be detected
utilizing either HMP or NMP in primary nonfunction, hepatic artery thrombosis,
postreperfusion syndrome, 1-year patient survival, or 1-year graft survival (P > 0.05).

Jia et al. Machine Perfusion: Future Preservation Method
Conclusions: Machine perfusion is superior to CS on improving short-term outcomes
for human liver transplantation, with a less clear effect in the longer term. Hypothermic
machine perfusion but not NMP conducted significantly protective effects on EAD
and biliary complications. Further RCTs are warranted to confirm MP’s superiority
and applications.

INTRODUCTION
Liver transplantation (LT) has been the optimal treatment
for patients with end-stage liver disease. Rapidly increasing
demands for LT have also caused severe shortage of donor liver
organs in clinical application. To overcome this discrepancy,
donation after circulatory death (DCD), extended criteria donors
(ECDs), living liver donation, or marginal liver grafts are
increasingly accepted to expand the limited donor pool. However,
studies have suggested that these additional liver donation
sources often suffered from longer warm ischemic periods and
worse ischemia–reperfusion injury (IRI) during LT, resulting
in increased risk of early allograft dysfunction (EAD), primary
nonfunction (PNF), biliary complications, and poorer long-term
graft and patient survival (1).
During transplantation, the quality of donor liver preservation
is an important factor on maintaining and improving transplant
outcomes of patients. Standard static cold storage (CS)
remains the gold standard method for liver graft preservation.
Nevertheless, the effectiveness of CS preservation is currently
unable to provide sufficient protection of liver grafts against IRI,
especially for prolonged CS of DCD and marginal livers, often
resulting in increased risk of EAD, PNF, and biliary complications
(2). As an alternative preservation strategy, machine perfusion
(MP) can provide a continuous circulation of metabolic
substrates and antioxidants, imitating the physiological processes
while flushing inflammatory cytokine and toxins from the graft.
Therefore, MP has been proposed as a better strategy to protect or
rescue marginal liver grafts by attenuating the cytokine mediated
IRI (3).
Machine perfusion has been widely used for preservation
in kidney transplantation. Plenty of evidence suggested MP’s
priority in improving early graft function, reducing the risk of
delayed graft function (DGF), and enhancing ECD graft survival
after renal transplantation (4). Unlike kidney transplantation,
MP remained relatively limited in clinical LTs due to the high
metabolism rates of liver, relatively complicated perfusion system

consisting of hepatic and portal route, poor practicality, and
high costs.
Large animal and human experimental studies have suggested
that MP may provide better protection of liver grafts against
IRI than CS (5, 6). Expression of proinflammatory cytokines,
oxidation markers, and activation of adhesion molecules and
migration of leukocytes were significantly reduced by MP (7).
Recently, two systematic review and meta-analyses concluded
that MP preservation is superior to CS in experimental rat and
pig models in terms of reducing hepatocellular injury [lower
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT),
lactate dehydrogenase levels] and biliary injury (lower alkaline
phosphatase, hyaluronic acid levels) (8, 9). Clinical adoption of
MP in LT has been intensively tested. Since the first clinical
series investigating the safety and efficacy of MP compared with
CS was reported by Guarrera et al. (10), increasing comparative
studies on MP and CS has been reported, showing the potential
benefit in improving early graft function, reducing posttransplant
complications, and enhancing long-term survival (11). However,
those benefits on outcomes were inconclusive without the pooled
analyses. Few systematic review and meta-analyses have tried
to investigate the effectiveness of MP on human, but they were
either short comprehensive or out-of-the-latest studies (12, 13).
Updated systematic review and meta-analyses are lacking and
needed to decide the preferred method of graft storage.
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we systematically
analyzed the available published data to compare MP
preservation with CS preservation on outcomes of LT, including
EAD, PNF, biliary complications, and graft and patient survival
after transplantation, with the aim of identifying the optimum
preservation method for donor livers and achieving preferable
outcomes in clinical application.
METHODS
Literature Search
A comprehensive literature search was carried out on
PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane library databases
using the following terms: ((machine perfusion OR machine
preservation) AND (liver OR liver transplant OR liver
transplantation)). The literature search was performed in
November 2019. Publications were limited to articles written
in English. The titles and abstracts of all relevant publications
were reviewed, and full texts of those potentially matching
the inclusion criteria were retrieved. Reference lists of the
retrieved full-text articles were also searched manually to help
identify potentially eligible studies. This systematic review and

Jia et al. Machine Perfusion: Future Preservation Method
meta-analysis was performed in line with the PRISMA (Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses)
recommendations (14).
Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Clinical studies comparing outcomes of human LT using MP
preservation vs. static CS were eligible for this analysis.
Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) studies without a
control group (without CS preservation group); (2) studies
not controlling the donor type between the MP group and
CS group; (3) studies using unusual MP method (including
subnormothermic MP and controlled rewarming MP); (4)
overlapping studies from the same institution; (5) studies
reporting none of the following outcomes of interest: EAD, PNF,
biliary complications, vascular complications, graft survival, and
patient survival; (6) simultaneous liver–kidney transplantation,
multiple organ transplantation, and living donor transplantation
studies; (7) nonhuman studies and experimental studies; (8)
abstracts, letters, editorials, books, expert opinions, case reports,
and review articles.
Quality Evaluation and Data Extraction
Newcastle–Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) was used to
evaluate the methodological quality of the included prospective
cohort studies (15). The quality of randomized controlled trial
(RCT) study was assessed using the Jadad score and the Cochrane
Collaboration’s risk of bias tool (16). Studies with score >6
were regarded as high quality. Two investigators (J.J. and Y.N.)
reviewed the publications, assessed the quality, and extracted the
data independently. Disagreements were resolved by discussion
and consensus, confirmed by another investigator (S.-S.Z.).
The primary outcomes extracted included the incidence
of EAD, PNF, hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT), total biliary
complications, and ischemic cholangiopathy (IC) rates after
transplantation. Secondary outcomes included liver graft
function, postreperfusion syndrome (PRS), and 1-month,
6-month, and 1-year graft and patient survival rates.
All of the studies defined EAD according to Olthoff et al.
(17). To be specific, EAD was defined as the presence of at
least one of the following at 7 days after LT: serum bilirubin 10
mg/dL; or international normalized ratio 1.6; or ALT >2,000 U/L
in the first 7 postoperative days. Primary nonfunction was
indicated as irreversible graft dysfunction, for nontechnical and
nonimmunological causes, leading to death or emergency liver
replacement during the first 10 days after LT (18). Definition of
IC was according to Lee et al. (19). Total biliary complications at
1 year were defined as all the complications related with biliary
duct including biliary leaks, biliary stricture, and other biliary
complications. Postreperfusion syndrome was defined according
to Hilmi et al. (20).
Statistical Analysis
Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were used to evaluate the summary
event rates (dichotomous data) with 95% confidence interval
(CI). Standardized mean difference (SMD) was used to compare
continuous data. Cochran Q (χ
2
) and the I
2
statistical
test were adopted to evaluate the heterogeneity among the
included studies. Heterogeneity was considered significant when
P < 0.10 or I
2 > 50%. In the absence of heterogeneity
among the included studies, a fixed-effects model was adopted
to combine studies and pool the total effect size; otherwise,
a random-effects model was adopted. Funnel plots were
created for assessment of publication bias (publication bias was
examined in funnel plots by performing Begg and Egger tests).
P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical
analyses were performed using Cochrane Review Manager
5.3. (http://ims.cochrane.org/revman).
RESULTS
Search Results and Study Characteristics
As for the selection process according to the PRISMA guidelines,
the detailed process of our literature search is shown in Figure 1.
Briefly, Initial literature searches identified 1,289 publications.
After excluding ineligible publications based on the selection
and exclusion criteria, 12 studies, including 10 nonrandomized
prospective phase I clinical trials (10, 21–29), one multi￾institutional randomized study (18), and one single-center,
randomized controlled study (30), were eventually included in
the meta-analysis of the comparison between MP and CS on
clinical outcomes in LT. In the 12 included studies, five studies
used hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP), whereas the other
seven studies investigated normothermic machine perfusion
(NMP). Of these 12 studies, seven were from European institutes,
including four single-center prospective trials, one multicenter
prospective trials (22, 25–27), one prospective multicenter
RCT (18), and one single-center, randomized controlled study
(30); two single-center prospective trials were from Canadian
institutes (23, 24), whereas the remaining three studies were from
the US institutes (10, 21). The years of publication spanned from
2010 to 2019. After combining all the studies, 315 patients were
included into the MP group, and 489 patients were included into
the CS group as control in our meta-analysis.
The characteristics of each study are summarized in Table 1.
The outcomes of each study are presented in Table 2 and
Supplementary Data. As shown in Table S1, the quality of the 12
included studies was good. The quality scores of included cohort
studies, evaluated by the NOS, ranged from 7 to 9 points (with a
mean of 7.9), whereas the risk of bias in the two included RCTs
was low.
Meta-Analysis of Primary Outcomes
Liver Graft Injury
Reperfusion injury and liver graft function were determined by
AST and/or ALT serum levels after transplantation. As shown in
Table 2, all 12 included studies reported posttransplant peak ALT
and/or AST level within 1 week. Seven of the 12 included studies
found a significantly lower posttransplant peak ALT and/or AST
level during the first 7 days after surgery in the MP group
compared with the CS group (P < 0.05) (10, 18, 21, 22, 25, 26,
28), whereas the rest (five studies) observed comparable hepatic
transaminases levels between two groups (23, 24, 27, 29, 30).
However, different studies reported transaminase by different
data types and at variable time points. Only three studies reported

posttransplant peak ALT and AST level by mean and standard
deviation (10, 28, 29). Meta-analysis demonstrated that livers
preserved with MP had significantly lower peak AST levels than
CS (SMD = −0.53; 95% CI = −1.04 to −0.02; P = 0.04)
(Figure 2). There was also a trend favoring the use of MP
in reducing posttransplant peak ALT levels compared with CS
(SMD = −0.44; 95% CI = −0.91 to −0.02; P = 0.06) (Figure 2).
Moreover, eight of the 12 included studies clinically measured
the longitudinal serum hepatic transaminases levels in 1 or
2 weeks after transplantation. Except Bral and colleagues’s trial
(24), seven studies reported a faster decline in posttransplant
hepatic transaminases levels in MP preservation recipients when
compared to CS preservation recipients (10, 18, 21–23, 26, 30).
Notably, six studies, including the large sample multicenter RCT
by Nasralla et al. (18) and the RCT by Ghinolfi et al. (30), found
statistically different reducing trends on posttransplant hepatic
transaminases between the two groups within the first week after
transplantation (P < 0.05) (10, 18, 21, 22, 26, 30).
Early Allograft Dysfunction
Eleven of the 12 included studies reported the incidence of EAD
within the first week posttransplantation. The overall rate of
EAD was 15.2% (range, 0–55.6%) for the MP group and 30.6%
(0–46.4%) for the CS group. Pooled meta-analysis of the HMP
and NMP studies revealed that the overall rate of EAD was
significantly reduced in the MP preservation compared with the
CS preservation (fixed effects: OR = 0.46; 95% CI = 0.31–0.67;
P < 0.0001) (Figure 3). There was no statistically significant
heterogeneity among the 11 included studies (χ
2 = 12.94,
P = 0.17, I
2 = 30%).
Subgroup analysis showed no significant difference between
two subgroups (I
2 = 0%; P = 0.78). In the subgroup analysis,
EAD rates were significantly lower in the HMP subgroup (fixed
effects: OR = 0.49; 95% CI = 0.27–0.88; P = 0.02) compared
to those of CS. There is statistically significant heterogeneity in
the NMP subgroup (χ
2 = 9.76, P = 0.04, I
2 = 59%). Thus, a
random-effects model was adopted. However, subgroup analysis
showed no significant difference between NMP preservation and
CS preservation (random effects: OR = 0.60; 95% CI = 0.24–1.52;
P = 0.28, figure not shown). In the NMP subgroup, a sensitivity
analysis was conducted by excluding Bral and colleagues’ study
(24) because of its heterogeneity in sample size and donor
type; the risk of EAD reached statistical significance between
two groups (fixed effects: OR = 0.34; 95% CI = 0.20–0.59;
P = 0.0001). The overall risk of EAD in the MP group remained
statistically significant (fixed effects: OR = 0.40; 95% CI = 0.27–
0.60; P < 0.00001; χ
2 = 7.07, P = 0.53, I
2 = 0%) (figure
not shown).

Primary Nonfunction
Except Watson and colleagues’ trial (27), the rest (11 studies)
evaluated the rate of PNF after transplantation. However,
episodes of PNF were observed in only three studies.
The incidence of PNF was 0.7% (range, 0–3.2%) in the
MP group and 1.1% (range, 0–6.7%) in the CS group,
respectively. No heterogeneity was observed (χ
2 = 1.09,
P = 0.58; I
2 = 0%); thus, a fixed-effects model was used.
A meta-analysis indicated that there was no statistical
significance in PNF rates between MP preservation and CS
preservation (OR = 0.60; 95% CI = 0.14–2.60; P = 0.49)
(Figure 4).
Total Biliary Complications and Ischemic
Cholangiopathy
All 12 studies reported biliary complications after transplantation
within 1-year follow-up. However, two studies did not report
detailed information of biliary complications (23, 28), and
one study did not provide the complication data in the CS
group (25), whereas Watson et al. trial reported only IC
instead of all biliary complications. The rest (eight studies)
compared the rates of total biliary complications between
the MP and CS groups at 1 year after transplantation
(Table 2). There was no heterogeneity among the eight studies
(χ
2 = 8.08, P = 0.33, I
2 = 13%); thus, a fixed model
was adopted. Meta-analysis of these studies indicated that
total biliary complications at 1 year after transplantation
were significantly lower in MP preservation group compared
with CS preservation group (fixed-effects model: OR = 0.53;
95% CI = 0.34–0.83; P = 0.006) (Figure 5). Subgroup
analysis showed that incidence of total biliary complications
was significantly lower in HMP patients compared with CS
patients (fixed-effects model: OR = 0.45; 95% CI = 0.25–
0.80; P = 0.007). However, no significant difference could
be detected between the NMP subgroup and CS subgroup

there is no statistical difference in IC rates between NMP
preservation and CS preservation (OR = 0.76; 95% CI = 0.24–

Hepatic Artery Thrombosis
Seven studies, including four HMP studies and three NMP
studies, compared the risk of posttransplant HAT between
the two preservation technologies. The overall incidence of
HAT was 2.1% (range, 0–10.0%) in the MP group and 5.2%
(range, 0–10.0%) in the CS group, respectively. Hepatic artery
thrombosis rates were lower in both the HMP group (fixed￾effects analysis: OR = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.12–1.77; P = 0.26) and
NMP group (fixed-effects analysis: OR = 0.67; 95% CI = 0.16–
2.77; P = 0.58) compared to those of the CS group. However,
there was no statistical significance (P > 0.05). A pooled meta￾analysis of HMP and NMP studies indicated that there was no
statistical significance in HAT rates between MP preservation
and CS preservation (OR = 0.55; 95% CI = 0.21–1.44;
P = 0.22) (Figure S1).
Postreperfusion Syndrome
Four studies reported the rates of PRS. Postreperfusion syndrome
rates were lower in the MP preservation group compared with the
CS group (random-effects effect: OR = 0.70; 95% CI = 0.18–2.73;
P = 0.61). However, it had no statistical significance (Figure S2).
Patient Survival and Liver Graft Survival
To evaluate the posttransplant survival outcomes of MP
preservation vs. CS preservation, the data of graft survival
and patient survival at 1 month, 6 month, and 1 year were
extracted and analyzed (Table S2). The meta-analysis indicated
that there was no difference in graft survival between MP
preservation patients and CS preservation at 1 month (seven
studies supported, OR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.21–2.88; P = 0.72;

As for patient survival (Table S3), the meta-analysis indicated
that there was no difference in patient survival between MP

1-year graft/patient survival analysis (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
The results of this meta-analysis provide a comprehensive
and up-to-date insight into the current evidence regarding the
priority of MP preservation to CS in the clinical setting. Our
analysis concludes that compared with CS preservation MP can
reduce the risk of post-LT EAD and total biliary complications.
However, MP preservation could not improve PNF, 1-year graft,
and patient survival.
Theoretically, MP preservation can simulate physiological
condition ex vivo after donor liver procurement by effectively
providing continuous circulation of oxygen, essential nutrients,
and adequate adenosine triphosphate substrates to restore the
normal physiological and also supplying vasodilators to maintain
the peribiliary vascular microcirculation while flushing out the
metabolites to avoid accumulation of toxic substances. Evidence
from animal models and human studies suggests that MP can
avoid cold ischemia injury during preservation and reduce
posttransplant IRI and sterile inflammation, thus causing less
damage to hepatocytes and the biliary epithelia in both deceased
brain donor (DBD) and DCD LT compared with CS preservation.
As a result, MP has been found to bring about significantly
reduced posttransplant peak enzyme release, lower EAD rates,
less biliary complications, and shorter hospital stay in MP livers.
Liver graft reperfusion injury was usually determined by
AST and/or ALT serum levels after transplantation. Previous
evidence suggested that episodes of EAD and elevation of
hepatic transaminases may adversely affect survival rates after
LT (17). Although the present analysis for posttransplant
AST/ALT comparisons was limited by different data types and
variable time points during recording clinical data in different
studies, our systematic review did show that all 12 included
studies observed posttransplant AST/ALT reductions in the
MP preservation group, with seven studies reaching statistical
significance (Table 2). Further pooled meta-analysis did confirm
the use of MP in reducing posttransplant peak AST levels
(P < 0.05), and there was a trend favoring MP in ALT
levels (P = 0.06) (Figure 2). Notably, 10 studies among all
included studies showed lower EAD rates in the MP group, with
pooled meta-analysis reaching statistical significance (Figure 3,
P < 0.0001). In line with animal studies, our meta-analysis
suggested that MP can achieve definite protecting effects for
reducing IRI by decreasing transaminases releasing.
As expected, a definite reduction in the overall risk of EAD was
confirmed in MP preservation recipients when compared with
CS preservation (OR = 0.46; P < 0.0001) (Figure 3), indicating
MP’s excellent protective effects in hepatocellular function. It
is notable that these reductions in peak hepatic transaminases
and EAD rates were achieved in the context of using DCDs or
ECDs with longer functional warm ischemia times (WITs) and
longer preservation times in the MP group (Table 1), suggesting
that MP may have substantial benefits in the desired objective of
expanding donor pool and increasing organ utilization without
compromising outcome.
Biliary complications have shown to be the most frequent
complications after DCD LT. Nonanastomotic biliary strictures
or IC is one of the most feared complications of DCD
LT. Specially, DCD recipients have a threefold higher
risk of developing nonanastomotic biliary strictures after
transplantation compared with DBD recipients (31). Long
periods of donor warm ischemia in DCD donation are
believed to be responsible for IC and graft loss. One important
benefit of MP may be its ability to maintain the peribiliary
vascular microcirculation and restore the normal physiological
environment of biliary tree, which has been shown to reduce
biliary IRI and biliary complications. The principal finding in
this study is that MP preservation can significantly reduce total
biliary complications at 1 year after transplantation (OR =
0.53; P = 0.006) (Figure 5). Furthermore, the rates of IC were
significantly lower in the MP group compared with the CS group
(OR = 0.39; P = 0.02) (Figure 6). Van Rijn et al. (6) further
investigated the protective effect of MP on histopathological
level in their trial, showing that MP significantly reduced the
injury of the deep peribiliary glands and the degree of stroma
necrosis. Machine perfusion can resuscitate the DCDs from long
functional warm ischemia and further protect the vulnerability
of the biliary tree from IRI, which may substantially reduce
biliary complications, expand the donor poor, and increase
DCD utilization.
In the current analysis, no significant effects could be detected
favoring the use of MP in reducing PNF rates compared with CS
(OR = 0.60; P = 0.49). This may be true, or more likely, there may
be insufficient data to draw the conclusions about the benefits of
MP on reducing PNF rates as clinical investigations on MP in LT
are still limited. Primary nonfunction rates are relatively low in
clinical practice, occurring in 5% to 8% of liver transplants, but
it may be a life-threatening circumstance requiring immediate
retransplantation (32, 33). In this study, the episodes of PNF
occurred in only one HMP-ECD liver in Guarrera and colleagues’
study, one NMP liver in Nasralla and colleagues’ study, and five
CS preservation livers in two studies, whereas the other studies
reported no incidence of PNF in either MP or CS preservation
groups (Table 2). The highest incidence of PNF remained only
6.7% in CS-ECD in Guarrera and colleagues’ study (21). Thus,
no difference seen in terms of reducing PNF rates may be due
to an inability to detect an effect of MP because of the very
low incidence of PNF after transplantation. Further large sample
clinical studies are needed to clarify this point.
Our present meta-analysis identifies no significant difference
in either 1-month, 6-month, or 1-year graft and patient
survival between MP preservation recipients and CS preservation
recipients (Figures S3, S4). Actually, 11 of the 12 included
studies reported no significant improvement in graft and patient
survival after MP preservation. Only in Dutkowski et al. (22)
retrospective comparative analysis, 1-year graft survival was
significantly improved in the MP-DCD group compared to
the CS-DCD group (P = 0.035). Although there was a trend
favoring MP preservation in Patrono and colleagues’ study
(29), with graft survival rates within the first year almost
Frontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 10 May 2020 | Volume 7 | Article 135

Jia et al. Machine Perfusion: Future Preservation Method
reaching significant level (P = 0.18), a longer follow-up result
was lacking. In Dutkowski and colleagues’ recent serial study
(34), they first reported 5-year graft survival after censoring
tumor recurrence was significantly improved by HOPE, reaching
94% in the HOPE-treated DCD group, compared to 78% in
the untreated DCD group (n = 50, P = 0.024) (Figure 3),
suggesting the superiority of MP preservation in DCD livers.
However, this small-number cohort study has limitations such
as retrospective design, different implantation techniques, and
inconsistent immune suppression between the MP and CS
groups, highlighting the necessity for large-sample RCTs. In
pig models, the recent meta-analysis identified no significant
difference in 5- to 7-day survival rate between the MP group and
CS group (9). Therefore, no clear evidence yet can be drawn to
conclude MP’s superiority to CS preservation in posttransplant
survival within 1-year follow-up. Definite superiority of MP
preservation in graft and patient survival compared with CS
preservation still needs to be investigated in future RCTs with
longer follow-up.
By reducing IRI and offering the opportunity for ex vivo
graft repair through delivery of targeted additives, MP seems to
provide more obviously protective effects in relatively low-quality
donors such as ECDs or DCDs. Thus, MP has the potential to
resuscitate the donor graft from IRI to a better state, reduce the
discarded rates, and increase the overall organ utilization. The
results of this study on MP’s benefits are consistent with those
findings in kidney transplantation. In kidney transplantation,
large RCTs and recent meta-analyses have drawn the conclusions
of MP’s superiority to CS on improvement in short-term
outcomes, such as enhanced early renal function and decreased
risk of DGF in DCD and ECD grafts. Similar to our analysis,
however, no significant differences could be found in PNF rates
and patient survival between MP and CS for DCD LT (35). In
one recent meta-analysis of NMP-assisted pig LT (12), both ex
vivo and in situ NMP could significantly reduced peak AST and
ALT levels compared with CS for DCD livers (P < 0.00001). It
is worth noting that total bile production was also significantly
higher (mean = 174 mL; CI, 155–193; P < 0.0001) in the NMP
group, indicating the excellent effect of NMP in preserving liver
functions and viability assessment. In Zhang and colleagues’
recent meta-analysis on HMP, they found that HMP could
significantly reduce the incidences of EAD (OR = 0.36; 95%
CI = 0.17–0.77; P = 0.008) and biliary complications (OR = 0.47;
95% CI = 0.28–0.76; P = 0.003), respectively. And there was no
difference in the incidence of PNF (OR = 0.30; 95% CI = 0.06–
1.47; P = 0.14) and vascular complications (OR = 0.69; 95%
CI = 0.29–1.6; P = 0.41) between HMP and CS preservation.
These results were consistent with our present analysis. However,
Zhang et al. found that 1-year graft survival was significantly
increased in HMP preservation compared to CS preservation
(OR = 2.19; 95% CI = 1.14–4.20; P = 0.02), in which there
was no difference in our analysis (OR = 1.15; 95% CI = 0.59–
2.22; P = 0.42). To be noted, Zhang and colleagues’ meta￾analysis included overlapping studies from the same institution
[Guarrera et al. (21) and Schlegel et al. (34)], which may magnify
the protective effects of HMP on outcomes. Moreover, the
included study of Dutkowski et al. (22) in Zhang and colleagues’
meta-analysis did not control the donor type, with DCD livers in
the HMP group and DBD livers in the CS group, which may bring
some bias in the meta-analysis. Therefore, the benefits of MP
on long-term survival required further researches. Combining
aforementioned findings in kidney transplantation, MP in pig
LT, and the results of this study, it is reasonable to conclude that
MP preservation could enhance early graft function recovery and
improve short-term outcomes after LT. However, there may be
less-clear benefits in the longer-term graft and patient outcomes.
In Tchilikidi’s (36) systematic review, the short-term outcomes
and 30-day mortality had no difference between NMP and CS
by comprehensive analysis on large literatures. The protective
effect of MP needs to be validated in more large multicenter
prospective trials with larger samples and longer-term follow￾up. In recent years, a batch of human clinical trials involving
the use of HMP or NMP in LT was implemented to further
validate MP’s safety, feasibility, and its superiority on long￾term outcomes (36). The results of some important RCTs are
coming out in the next few years, which may greatly propel the
development of MP’s clinical applications (2, 36). Future meta￾analyses are necessary to confirm the recommendation of MP in
human LT.
The present study has several limitations. First, clinical
heterogeneity between the included studies might still exist,
although we had adopted strict enrollment criteria during
screening the references. Selection bias due to different donor
types, perfusion models, perfusion routes, hemodynamics, cold
ischemia times (CITs), and perioperative parameter among
different publications may still result in analytical bias. Notably,
a recent meta-analysis did not observe any differences in post-LT
outcomes such as PNF, biliary complication, and 1-year survival
while using different perfusion fluids, volumes, or perfusion
routes (37), indicating these factors may have less effect on
the LT outcomes. Second, the number and the sample size of
included studies are relatively small as clinical application of
MP in LT and the completed human cases are still limited.
There is unlikely to be adequate power to identify differences in
relatively low-risk complications such as PNF. Also, the follow￾up in the majority of included studies is relatively short, and very
few studies reported 1-year graft and patient survival. Thus, no
sufficient evidence can be obtained to find differences in graft
and patient survival. In addition, this study presented data only
about the short-term patient and graft survival, the influence
of MP on long-term survival remains unclear. Third, the MP
technique used in clinical setting is still under the stages of
preliminary clinical trial. The meta-analysis data in this study
mainly came from small-number trials, and the overall level of
clinical evidence is not high. Considering these limitations in
study methodology and sample size, further large-sample RCTs
are needed to further confirm the benefits of MP on the prognosis
of LT.
In conclusion, this meta-analysis demonstrates that MP
preservation, especially HMP, could significantly improve short￾term outcomes by reducing the rates of EAD, total biliary
complications, and IC after transplantation compared to CS
preservation. However, it was not correlated with the incidence of
PNF, HAT, and 1-year graft and patient survivals. Considering the

benefits, MP preservation is still recommended for LT to expand
the donor pool and improve posttransplant outcomes.
