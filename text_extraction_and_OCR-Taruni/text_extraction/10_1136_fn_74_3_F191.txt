Abstract
Aims-To assess the incidence of tyrosin￾aemia type I in the West Midlands Region,
and the value of current neonatal screen￾ing programmes for phenylketonuria
(PKU) for its detection.
Methods-Retrospective study of results
from the PKU neonatal screening pro￾grammes in Birmingham (using plasma
amino acid chromatography) and in the
rest of the West Midlands (using the
Guthrie microbiological assay for blood
spot phenylalanine) was carried out
between January 1985 and March 1994.
Patients with tyrosinaemia I born in the
region during the same period were iden￾tified from a regional database of patients
with confirmed inherited metabolic
disease. The study was carried out in a
specialist children's hospital; the regional
centre in the West Midlands for neonatal
screening and investigation of inborn
errors, and a supraregional centre for
liver transplantation and management of
paediatric liver disease.
Results-Amino acid chromatography
showed increased tyrosine in 447 of 145 444
neonates born in Birmingham; this was
still increased at 6 weeks ofage in six cases.
Five had tyrosinaemia I; the sixth had
tyrosinaemia type III. Two others in whom
amino acid chromatography was con￾sidered normal have since presented with
tyrosinaemia I. Outside Birmingham,
525 151 children were screened using the
Guthrie test. Five have presented clinically
with tyrosinaemia I; screening did not
contribute to diagnosis in any case. The
incidence of tyrosinaemia I was 1 in 20 791
live births within Birmingham and 1 in
105 037 outside. Of the total 12 patients in
the West Midlands with tyrosinaemia I, 10
(83%) were ofnon-oriental Asian ethnicity;
the incidence of tyrosinaemia I was 3-7/106
head of population in this group and
0-04/106 in the rest ofthe population.
Conclusions-Asians in the West Midlands
have a high incidence of tyrosinaemia I.
Neonatal PKU screening using amino acid
chromatography may contribute to diag￾nosis and early treatment.

Keywords: tyrosinaemia, screening, phenylketonuria.
In 1969 the United Kingdom introduced a
national neonatal screening programme for
the detection of phenylketonuria (PKU;
McKusick 26160). This entailed the measure￾ment of phenylalanine concentrations in blood
samples collected by skin puncture between six
and 10 days after delivery. The choice of
analytical method for phenylalanine was left to
individual laboratories. Methods available
include the Guthrie microbiological assay' and
one-dimensional amino acid chromatography.2
The former is a specific assay for phenylalanine;
the latter can also demonstrate increased
concentrations of several other amino acids
including tyrosine.
Tyrosinaemia type I (fumaryl acetoacetase
deficiency; McKusick 276700) is an inborn
error of tyrosine metabolism with an estimated
worldwide incidence of lin 100000 to 1 in
120 000.3 4 Clinical presentation may be with
hepatic failure during the first year of life, a
Fanconi syndrome with rickets, or acute
porphyric-like episodes.4 5 Hepatocellular car￾cinoma develops usually during the second
decade. The disease is characterised biochemi￾cally by increased plasma concentrations of
tyrosine. Definitive diagnosis is by demonstra￾tion of increased urinary excretion of succinyl￾acetone, and by assay of fumaryl acetoacetase
activity in leucocytes, fibroblasts, or hepato￾cytes. Plasma concentrations of phenylalanine
and/or methionine are often increased as a
result of hepatic dysfunction.
Amino acid chromatography may demon￾strate increased concentrations of tyrosine in
plasma or whole blood in a proportion of
patients with tyrosinaemia at 6 days of age,
although benign transient neonatal hyper￾tyrosinaemia (McKusick 276500) may give
indistinguishable findings.6 Increases in
plasma phenylalanine caused by hepatic
disease may be detectable in neonates using
the Guthrie assay, as has been observed in
patients with galactosaemia (McKusick
23040).7 Although neonatal screening pro￾grammes for tyrpsinaemia in the United
Kingdom have not generally been regarded as
cost effective, because of the relatively low
incidence of the disease and the lack of an
effective treatment to alter the long term out￾come, the success of liver transplantation8-10
and 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3
cyclohexanedione (NTBC) treatmentl1-13
suggest that it is appropriate to reassess this.
We therefore assessed the prevalence of
tyrosinaemia in the West Midlands Regional
Health Authority (RHA), and the ability to
detect it using current screening programmes
for phenlyketonuria (PKU), based on
chromatography and on the Guthrie test, using
retrospective analysis of data over almost 10
years.

Demographic information for the RHA and
for individual districts of the West Midlands
County was obtained from the 1991 National
Census.14 15 Data on birth rates were avail￾able from neonatal screening laboratory
records.
For historical reasons, the neonatal screen￾ing service within the West Midlands RHA
uses two different methods for the detection of
PKU. Within the health authorities serving
Birmingham, one-dimensional amino acid
chromatography of plasma anticoagulated with
heparin is used as the screening test for all
specimens. In the rest of the West Midlands
Region, the Guthrie microbiological method is
used to detect increased phenylalanine concen￾trations in dried blood spots, with confirma￾tion of abnormal results by amino acid
chromatography.
All specimens received as part of the neo￾natal screening programme for PKU from
children born between 1 January 1985 and 31
March 1994 were included in the study. The
protocol for investigation was as follows: when
amino acid chromatography (used either as the
first line test or to confirm an abnormal result
on the Guthrie test) showed an increased
plasma tyrosine, a screening test for galactose￾1-phosphate uridyl transferase activity was per￾formed and (when plasma was available)
alkaline phosphatase, aminotransferase, and -y￾glutamyl transpeptidase activities were
assayed. When these were abnormal, further
investigations were performed as guided by the
clinical situation. Otherwise, a repeat specimen
for amino acid chromatography was requested
when the child was aged 6 weeks. If tyrosine

remained increased at this time, either quantifi￾cation of urinary succinylacetone excretion
(before 1989) or a screening test for increased
excretion was performed as part of a protocol to
investigate for potential causes. Positive results
were confirmed by assay of fumaryl aceto￾acetase activity, usually in cultured fibroblasts.
Clinical and biochemical information on
patients diagnosed within the West Midlands
was collated by the Clinical Chemistry
Department at the Children's Hospital,
Birmingham, which since 1991 has provided a
national service for assay of fumaryl aceto￾acetase activity. In most cases (in particular,
when liver transplantation or treatment with
NTBC were considered) patients were
reviewed clinically at the same hospital, which
is a supraregional centre for management of
inherited metabolic and paediatric liver
diseases, and one of two centres performing
paediatric liver transplantation in the United
Kingdom.
The incidence and prevalence of tyrosi￾naemia type 1 within subgroups were compared
with that in the whole of the West Midlands by
means of the binomial distribution. Other com￾parisons were performed using the x2 test. The
MINITAB 8 statistical program (Minitab Inc,
Pennsylvania) was used for all comparisons.
Results
Between January 1985 and March 1994, 670
718 babies were born within the West
Midlands, 145 534 within Birmingham and
525 184 outside. The detection of hyper￾tyrosinaemia both by neonatal screening and
by subsequent clinical presentation is shown in
table 1, and patient details provided in table 2.
Within Birmingham, amino acid chromato￾graphy showed an increased plasma tyrosine
concentration in 447 neonates (Os3l1% of those
screened). Of these, one presented with a chest
infection and abnormal coagulation at 8 days
of age, and was found to have tyrosinaemia
type I. A further five infants (0'004%) had per￾sistently increased plasma tyrosine at 6 weeks
of age. One child (case 6) had 4-hydrox￾yphenylpyruvate dioxygenase deficiency
(tyrosinaemia type III; McKusick 276710),
and the other four had tyrosinaemia type I.
One (case 5) had ascites at the time of repeat
testing, while the rest showed no clinical
evidence of disease at the time of diagnosis.

Screeningfor tyrosinaemia type I F193
Two other children born in Birmingham
have since presented clinically with tyrosi￾naemia type I. In one (case 8), the initial screen
at 10 days of age was normal. The other (case
7) showed an increased plasma tyrosine on the
initial screen, but a repeat specimen collected at
3 weeks of age was reported as normal. Thus
when amino acid chromatography was used as
the initial screening test for PKU, the false posi￾tive detection rate for disorders of tyrosine
metabolism was 0-32% at 6 days, but had fallen
to 0% (diagnostic specificity 100%) by 6 weeks.
The diagnostic sensitivity was 71% (95% con￾fidence interval 38-100%) for detection of
tyrosinaemia type I.
In the rest of the West Midlands RHA,
demonstration of an increased whole blood
phenylalanine by the Guthrie test led to the
discovery of an increased whole blood tyrosine
in 163 children (0 03%); none of these was
subsequently found to have tyrosinaemia.
Tyrosinaemia type I has been diagnosed in five
(0 001%) children born in this part of the West
Midlands RHA, one of whom presented with
hypoglycaemia and acute renal failure aged 2
days. Whole blood phenylalanine was normal
at 6-10 days of age in the other four, and
amino acid chromatography was therefore not
performed.
Eleven of the 13 patients with disorders of
tyrosine metabolism were of non-oriental
Asian descent. We therefore correlated their
place of birth with the local ethnicity. The
children of Caucasian descent were born in
areas where less than 5% of the population in
1991 was of non-oriental Asian ancestry. The
remaining 11 were born in areas where over
5% were of Asian ancestry; in Birmingham,
where eight children were born, those of non￾oriental Asian descent formed 14 1% of the
population. The number of cases observed
annually by district was 0-07/1 06 head ofpopu￾lation in areas with <5% non-oriental Asian
descent (95% CI 0-03 to 0-17/106), and
0.53/106 in areas with >5% Asian descent
(95% CI 0-20 to 0.86/106; P<0O05 vs whole of
West Midlands). By ethnic group, the annual
number of cases in the whole of the West
Midlands was 3.7/106 among those of non￾oriental Asian descent (95% CI 1-4 to 6-1/106;
P<0 0001 vs incidence in the entire popu￾lation) and 0.04/106 (95% CI <0 01 to
0.1 1/106) in the rest of the population. A high
proportion of the non-oriental Asian patients
with tyrosinaemia type I (eight out of 10) are
known to be the products of consanguineous
(first cousin) marriages and the mothers of two
of these eight patients are second cousins. The
parents of both white patients are unrelated.
Discussion
This study has confirmed that disorders of
tyrosine metabolism can be detected using the
existing neonatal screening programme for
PKU with an amino acid chromatographic
assay. The small number of patients born out￾side Birmingham did not have liver disease
severe enough to produce an increase in
plasma phenylalanine detectable by the
Guthrie test at 6-10 days of age, although
amino acid chromatography, if performed,
may have shown an increased blood tyrosine.
We have also demonstrated a fivefold increase
in the incidence of tyrosinaemia type I within
Birmingham (1 in 20 791) compared with that
in the rest of the West Midlands region (1 in
105 037). This latter figure is comparable with
the incidence reported worldwide.3 4 We may
have underestimated the incidence of tyrosin￾aemia, as some children may have died without
the diagnosis being recognised, or may have
failed as yet to present clinically. The latter is
unlikely, as most patients present within the
first two years of life.3 5 16 We consider it
unlikely that we are unaware of any patients
with confirmed tyrosinaemia within the West
Midlands region, because of the biochemical
and clinical interest within this regional centre
in liver disease in general, and tyrosinaemia in
particular.
The increased incidence of tyrosinaemia
observed within Birmingham seems to be
associated with non-oriental Asian ethnicity
and consanguinity. Classification of births by
parental ethnicity was not available during the
period of this study. To obtain some measure of
the incidence of tyrosinaemia in different popu￾lations, we therefore compared the number of
annual cases with the size of the appropriate
ethnic population. This approach is subject to
variations in family size, but suggests that
tyrosinaemia type I is about 90 times more
common among those of non-oriental Asian
descent than among the white population. A
high incidence of tyrosinaemia type I is recog￾nised among French Canadians from the
Saguenay-Lac Saint-Jean region of Quebec and
also among Scandinavians,4 but has not to our
knowledge been described before in Asians.
Our results suggest that the disease may be
underdescribed within the Indian subcontinent.
A high proportion of false positive results are
found at 6-10 days of age when amino acid
chromatography is used to screen for raised
plasma tyrosine, necessitating a repeat assay
several weeks later. This repeat assay has high
specificity; but the delay in diagnosis permits a
proportion of children (23% in this study) to
develop clinical features of liver disease before
diagnosis. A method of confirming the diag￾nosis of tyrosinaemia type I at the time of the
initial screen would permit earlier diagnosis
and treatment. Options include the assay of
succinylacetone in urine, serum, or dried blood
spots,17 immunoreactive fumaryl acetoacetase
in blood spots,'8 or porphobilinogen synthase
activity in blood spots.19 None of these
currently seems ideal. Succinylacetone pro￾duction seems to depend on diet.'8 Assay of
immunoreactive fumaryl acetoacetase is cur￾rently in use in Quebec, where 90% of patients
are homozygous for a mutation associated
with absence of immunoreactive protein.20
Porphobilinogen synthase activity has yet to be
evaluated in a screening programme, and its
use is likely to be subject to the same limita￾tions as that of succinylacetone. A prospective
comparison of these approaches is required to
assess their relative merits.

Our failure to detect all patients with
tyrosinaemia born in Birmingham is disap￾pointing. One case was detected on the initial
amino acid chromatography screen, but was
classified as normal on repeat testing. The
other patient did not have an increased plasma
tyrosine at the time of the initial screen. The
reason for this is unclear. Midwives collecting
specimens for PKU screening are instructed to
indicate that neonates have been established
on milk for at least 72 hours, and a repeat
sample is requested if this condition is not ful￾filled. However, feeding may have been with￾drawn temporarily in the infant in whom
repeat testing was normal. One or two patients
in whom plasma tyrosine was normal or only
slightly raised at diagnosis have been
reported.4 21 In the Quebec screening pro￾gramme mean plasma tyrosine at diagnosis has
fallen progressively from 854 ,umol/l in
1970-74 to 567 ,umol/l in 1990-91. The low￾est reported plasma tyrosine in a neonate with
tyrosinaemia diagnosed through that pro￾gramme was 210 ,umolll, the threshold for
further investigation being set at 200 ,umol/l. A
high index of suspicion and careful choice of
the threshold value seem necessary to avoid
false negative results, on the one hand, and a
disproportionate number of false positives
(requiring further investigation) on the other.
We are currently assessing quantitative assays
for tyrosine and succinylacetone, as use of such
assays may allow more reliable detection than
amino acid chromatography of patients with
mild increases in plasma tyrosine.
Detection of tyrosinaemia by the protocol
used in this study was a modest addition to the
PKU national screening programme, and the
cost of the initial tests was covered by that pro￾gramme. We have not performed a detailed
assessment of the costs associated with the
review of neonates in whom tyrosine is raised,
but the laboratory costs for this are about £300
a year. Unfortunately, we are unable to
quantify the cost of nursing time involved in
collecting repeat specimens. The choice of
appropriate technology nationally for neonatal
screening is currently under review, and this
may have a significant impact on the cost of
screening for tyrosinaemia. Further assessment
of the place of NTBC in treatment is required
before a full cost-benefit analysis can be per￾formed.
This study confirms that tyrosinaemia type I
is relatively common among Asian children in
the West Midlands, and that a proportion of
patients can be detected by neonatal screening
using amino acid chromatography. Further
work is required to increase the sensitivity of
screening, and to evaluate the most appropriate
diagnostic tests which can be performed using
the initial screening specimen. We suggest that
neonatal screening for tyrosinaemia type I
merits further assessment, particularly in areas
where a high proportion of the population is of
Asian ethnicity.
