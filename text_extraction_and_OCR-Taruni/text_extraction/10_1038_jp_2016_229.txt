Abstract
Objective:


Feeding neonates orally while on nasal continuous positive airway
pressure (nCPAP) is a common practice. We hypothesize that
pressurized airflow provided by nCPAP will alter the swallowing
mechanism in neonates, increasing the risk of aspiration during oral
feeding.
Study Design:
Infants receiving nCPAP with a RAM cannula and tolerating at least
50% of their feeding orally were included in the study (one term;
six preterm infants). Each participant underwent a
videofluoroscopic swallow study while on nCPAP and off nCPAP. A
non-parametric signed-rank test was used for paired data.
Result:
The incidence of deep penetration (P=0.03) and aspiration
(P=0.01) decreased significantly off-nCPAP compared with on-
nCPAP. However, the incidence of mild penetration (P=0.65) and
nasopharyngeal reflux (P=0.87) remained the same under both
conditions.
Conclusion:
Oral feeding while on-nCPAP significantly increases the risk of
laryngeal penetration and tracheal aspiration events. We
recommend caution when initiating oral feedings on nCPAP.
