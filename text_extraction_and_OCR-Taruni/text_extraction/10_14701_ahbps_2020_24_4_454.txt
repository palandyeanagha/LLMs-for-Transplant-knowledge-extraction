Backgrounds/Aims: Simultaneous liver and kidney transplantation (SLKT) has been established as the treatment of 
choice for patients with concurrent end‐stage liver and end‐stage kidney diseases. The objective of this study was 
to analyze the nationwide incidence of SLKT in Korea and the outcomes of SLKT in a high-volume transplant center. 
Methods: Databases of the Korean Network for Organ Sharing (KONOS) and Asan Medical Center from 2000 to 2019 
were retrospectively reviewed to determine the incidence of SLKT. Results: During 20 years from 2000 to 2019, de￾ceased donor SLKT was performed for 38 cases in the KONOS database. The proportion of deceased donor SLKT 
was 0.6% (20 of 3333) before adoption of MELD score, which was significantly increased to 1.2% (18 of 1524) after 
the adoption of MELD score (p=0.034). In our institution, there were 11 cases of SLKT (2 cases with deceased donors 
and 9 cases with living donors). SLKT accounted for 0.2% (11 of 6468) of total liver transplantation volume. During 
follow-up, five patients died due to hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence (n=2), infection (n=2), or unknown cause (n=1). 
The 1-year and 10-year overall patient survival rates were 90.9% and 81.8%, respectively. Conclusions: Results of 
this study revealed that the incidence of deceased donor SLKT was very low. An increase of such incidence is not 
anticipated unless the number of deceased donors is markedly increased. Currently, sequential living donor liver trans￾plantation and kidney transplantation with deceased or living donors are mainstays of transplantation rather than SLKT 
in our institution. (Ann Hepatobiliary Pancreat Surg 2020;24:454-459)

INTRODUCTION
The first successful simultaneous liver and kidney 
transplantation (SLKT) was performed in 1983.1
 Thereaf￾ter, SLKT has been established as the treatment of choice 
for patients with concurrent end‐stage liver and end‐stage 
kidney diseases.1,2 Currently, more than 400 SLKTs are 
performed annually in Europe and the United States.2-4 In 
contrast, SLKT is still a rare procedure in Korea. Only 
38 cases of SLKT from deceased donors were registered 
to the Korean Network for Organ Sharing (KONOS) data￾base from 2000 to 2019. SLKT has been usually per￾formed with different living liver and kidney donors in 
Korea. Since there are only a few case reports of SLKT 
from Korean transplant centers in the literature,5-8 in￾formation on SLKT in Korea is very limited. The ob￾jective of the present study was to analyze the nationwide 
incidence of SLKT and the outcomes of SLKT in a 
high-volume transplant center in Korea.

tion in Korea since 2016. The study protocol was ap￾proved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of our in￾stitution (IRB No. 2020-0857). The requirement for in￾formed consent was waived by the IRB due to the retro￾spective nature of this study. This study was performed 
in accordance with ethical guidelines of the World 
Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki 2013.
Statistical analysis
Numerical data are presented as mean±standard devi￾ation. Survival rates were estimated using the Kaplan–
Meier method. Chi-square test was used for comparison 
of incidence variable. A p-value of less than 0.05 was 
considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses 
were performed using SPSS version 22 (IBM, New York, 
NY, USA).
RESULTS
Incidence of SLKT in the KONOS database
During the 20-year study period from January 2000 to 
December 2019, there were 38 cases of SLKT from de￾ceased donors (1 case in 2004, 2007, and 2008 each; 4 
cases in 2009; 3 cases in 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 
each; 1 case in 2015; 4 cases in 2016; 7 cases in 2017; 
4 cases in 2018; and 3 cases in 2019). During the same 
period, the number of total deceased donor liver trans￾plantation (DDLT) and deceased donor kidney trans￾plantation (DDKT) cases were 4857 (3333 cases before 
adoption of MELD score and 1524 cases after adoption 
of MELD score) and 10768 (7035 cases before adoption 
of MELD score and 3733 cases after adoption of MELD), 
respectively. The proportion of deceased donor SLKT was 
0.6% (20 of 3333) before adoption of MELD score, which 
was significantly increased to 1.2% (18 of 1524) after the 
adoption of MELD score (p=0.034).
Profiles of SLKT in Asan Medical Center
From January 2000 to December 2019, 6468 cases of 
LT (1056 cases of DDLT and 5412 cases of living donor 
liver transplantation [LDLT]) and 4818 cases of KT (1036 
cases of DDKT and 3782 cases of living donor kidney 
transplantation [LDKT]) were performed in our insti￾tution. There were 11 cases of SLKT, 2 cases with de￾ceased donors and 9 cases with living donors. SLKT ac￾counted for 0.2% (11 of 6468) of total LT volume. 
Although 21.7% (1056 of 4857) of nationwide DDLT vol￾ume were performed in our institution during the study 
period, deceased donor SLKT accounted for only 5.3% (2 
of 38). There was no case of deceased donor SLKT after 
the introduction of MELD score.
Detailed profiles of these 11 cases of SLKT are sum￾marized in Table 1. The mean MELD score was 30.1±8.2. 
One patient (Case No. 8) with polycystic disease under￾went bilateral nephrectomy due to recurrent infection at 
one year after SLKT. Three patients (Case No. 2, 3, and 
9) showed acute rejection of kidney allograft which was 
managed with anti-rejection treatment. During a mean fol￾low-up period of 137±67 months, five patients died due 
to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence (n=2), in￾fection (n=2), and unknown cause (n=1). The pretrans￾plant extent of HCC was beyond Milan criteria in the two 
patients who showed posttransplant recurrence. The 1-year, 
3-year, 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year overall patient surviv￾al rates were 90.9%, 81.8%, 81.8%, 81.8%, and 46.0%, 
respectively (Fig. 1).
Profiles of KT before and after LT in Asan 
Medical Center
Three patients had undergone KT first. After a mean 
period of 68 months (range, 20-104 months), they also un￾derwent LT (all DDLTs). Thus, sequential KT-LT was 
performed in three patients.
In contrast, 34 patients had undergone LT first. After 
a mean period of 93 months (range, 1-234 months), they 

Minjae Kim, et al. Simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation 457
also underwent KT (DDKT in 11 and LDKT in 23). Thus, 
sequential LT-KT was performed in 34 patients. Current￾ly, 51 patients are in the waiting list of DDKT. Eleven 
of them were enrolled before LT and 40 patients were en￾listed after LT.
DISCUSSION
A considerable proportion of patients with both end￾stage liver and kidney diseases have undergone LT alone 
or SLKT worldwide. Recently, the proportion of SLKT 
among all LTs in the United States increased up to 9.9% 
in 2016.3,4 Meanwhile, because of profound deceased do￾nor shortage in Korea, around 1% of LT candidates had 
undergone deceased donor SLKT in the current analysis 
of the KONOS database. In our institution, only 0.2% of 
total LT cases underwent SLKT with deceased or living 
donors. To the best of our knowledge, our Case No. 1 
was the first case of SLKT in Korea. Considering that KT 
was performed in 3 patients before LT and 34 patients 
after LT, the sum of combined LT and KT was 48, ac￾counting for 0.7% of total LT cases. In addition, 51 pa￾tients are currently enrolled in the waiting list of DDKT. 
Considering that there are many other patients showing 
slow but progressive deterioration of renal function after 
LT, the demand for KT in LT recipients would be higher 
than we calculated.
Information on SLKT in Korea is very limited. There 
are only a few case reports of SLKT from Korean trans￾plant centers in the literature.5-8 A Korean single-center 
report on 3000 cases of KT has presented the performance 
of 16 cases of SLKT,9
 however, detailed information on 
SLKT was not described. This was the primary reason 
that we carried out this study.
Renal disease has high impacts on LT candidates. 
Serum creatinine is included in the MELD scoring system 
because renal impairment is associated with a substantial 
increase in 30‐day mortality, especially if an LT candidate 
requires dialysis.1,3 Renal impairment is a common occur￾rence in patients with liver disease. Some studies in￾dicated that its prevalence is 15%-20% in LT candidates.10
The requirement to update MELD scores after the initial 
listing allows for allocation of a liver to those most in 
need.
Renal disease on LT recipients also has a high prog￾nostic impact. The impact of kidney disease on LT candi￾dates is not limited to pretransplant mortality. LT recipi￾ents who develop chronic kidney disease (CKD) following 
LT show significant increases of liver allograft failure and 
mortality compared to those who do not develop CKD af￾ter LT. Significant renal disease prior to LT is the most 
important risk factor for CKD after LT. Determining the 
cause of acute kidney injury in LT candidates can be chal￾lenging, which complicates the ability to assess potential 
renal recovery after LT. LT candidates on dialysis for 
more than 90 days with advanced CKD and prolonged 
acute kidney injury not from hepatorenal syndrome have 
a higher risk for significant renal impairment after LT.11
After the introduction of MELD criteria for allocation 
of LT in the United States, there was a more than 400% 
increase in SLKT, from 2.5% in 2001 to 9.9% in 2016. 
This change was driven primarily by poor outcomes of 
LT recipients with posttransplant kidney disease, an in￾ability to predict which candidates were likely to develop 
post‐LT CKD, and the lack of a mechanism to expedite 
KT in LT recipients who developed advanced CKD after 
LT.11 The introduction of MELD score to the KONOS liv￾er allocation system and an increase in the number of de￾ceased donors raised the proportion of deceased donor 
SLKT from 0.6% before the adoption of MELD score to 
1.2% after the adoption of MELD score in the present 
study.12-14 Although this increase was statistically sig￾nificant, the proportion of SLKT was still very low com￾pared to that in the United States.11,15
An analysis of United Network for Organ Sharing 
(UNOS)/Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network 
(OPTN) data has demonstrated a clear benefit of SLKT 
in LT candidates on dialysis for more than 2 months prior 
to LT and in those with a serum creatinine of greater than 
2.5 mg/dl, in which SLKT recipients show improved sur￾vival than those who receive LT alone.16 In addition, de￾ceased donor SLKT can avoid immunological complex￾ities of implanting two organs from different donors. 
Human leukocyte antigen tissue typing and compatibility 
have a much larger role in allograft survival in KT 
recipients. SLKT provides improved immunological out￾comes in this setting. Based on these benefits of SLKT, 
a formal policy was enacted in 2017 in the United States 
with defined listing criteria for SLKT and priority for pa￾tients who had received LT and subsequently developed 

458 Ann Hepatobiliary Pancreat Surg Vol. 24, No. 4, November 2020 www.ahbps.org
significant kidney disease after LT.3
In the current KONOS allocation policy, multiple or 
two-organ transplantation does not have any priority for 
liver or kidney allocation. The primary background rea￾sons of the increase in SLKT after introduction of MELD 
score in the KONOS allocation system might be the high 
MELD score per se from CKD in SLKT candidates and 
an increase of deceased donors at that time. However, 
considering that the daily cutoff MELD score for liver al￾location is very high and the number of deceased donors 
is recently decreasing, it is difficult to expect that de￾ceased donor SLKT would be continuously increasing 
afterwards.14 It is a dilemma to give a priority to SLKT 
candidates in the current Korean setting because separate 
allocation of kidney and liver organs can save two 
patients.
The majority of SLKTs in our institution were per￾formed through a combination of LDLT and LDKT. It is 
usual to have two different donors for LDLT and LDKT. 
Although two-organ donation from a living donor has an 
immunologic benefit for LDKT,15,17,18 there are ethical and 
medical issues, especially issues regarding donor safety. 
One study supports such two-organ donation for pediatric 
patients.15 However, right liver donation for adult LT re￾cipients might carry higher risk than left liver donation 
for pediatric patients.
SLKT with different liver and kidney living donors has 
different aspects from that with one deceased donor. In 
reality, half of adult LDLTs in Korea have been per￾formed for patients with HCC. These patients carry risk 
of posttransplant HCC recurrence.19,20 In the present study, 
two of five patients died due to HCC recurrence. Sequen￾tial LDLT and KT with living or deceased donors would 
be beneficial to avoid risk of futile KT from early HCC 
recurrence after LT. We presume that it would be one of 
the underlying reasons to not prefer SLKT with living 
donors. As shown in results of this study, SLKT with liv￾ing donors was not performed after 2011 in our insti￾tution. Sequential LT-KT has settled as a main modality 
of LT-KT combination.
This study has a notable limitation. It was a retro￾spective, single-center study with a small number of study 
patients. Further high-volume multicenter studies are 
needed to validate results of this study.
In conclusion, the results of this study revealed that the 
incidence of deceased donor SLKT was very low despite 
the introduction of MELD score. An increase of its in￾cidence in the near future is not anticipated unless the 
number of deceased donors is markedly increased. Cur￾rently, sequential LDLT and KT with deceased or living 
donors is the main stay of transplantation rather than 
SLKT in our institution.
