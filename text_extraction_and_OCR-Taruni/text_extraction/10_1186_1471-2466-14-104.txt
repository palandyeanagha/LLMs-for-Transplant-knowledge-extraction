Abstract
Background: Clinical evaluation to differentiate the characteristic features of pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema is
often difficult in patients with combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE), but diagnosis of pulmonary
fibrosis is important for evaluating treatment options and the risk of acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia of
such patients. As far as we know, it is the first report describing a correlation among clinical, radiological, and
whole-lung pathological features in an autopsy cases of CPFE patients.
Methods: Experts retrospectively reviewed the clinical charts and examined chest computed tomography (CT)
images and pathological findings of an autopsy series of 22 CPFE patients, and compared these with findings from
8 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients and 17 emphysema-alone patients.
Results: All patients had a history of heavy smoking. Forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC%)
was significantly lower in the emphysema-alone group than the CPFE and IPF-alone groups. The percent predicted
diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO%) was significantly lower in the CPFE group than the
IPF- and emphysema-alone groups. Usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern was observed radiologically in 15
(68.2%) CPFE and 8 (100%) IPF-alone patients and was pathologically observed in all patients from both groups.
Pathologically thick-cystic lesions involving one or more acini with dense wall fibrosis and occasional fibroblastic
foci surrounded by honeycombing and normal alveoli were confirmed by post-mortem observation as thick-walled
cystic lesions (TWCLs). Emphysematous destruction and enlargement of membranous and respiratory bronchioles
with fibrosis were observed in the TWCLs. The cystic lesions were always larger than the cysts of honeycombing.
The prevalence of both radiological and pathological TWCLs was 72.7% among CPFE patients, but no such lesions
were observed in patients with IPF or emphysema alone (p = 0.001). The extent of emphysema in CPFE patients
with TWCLs was greater than that in patients without such lesions. Honeycombing with emphysema was also
observed in 11 CPFE patients.
Conclusions: TWCLs were only observed in the CPFE patients. They were classified as lesions with coexistent
fibrosing interstitial pneumonia and emphysema, and should be considered an important pathological and
radiological feature of CPFE.

Background
There have been several reports of idiopathic interstitial
pneumonia, occasionally coexisting with emphysema
[1,2], and a recent case series reported upper lobe
emphysema associated with lower lobe fibrosis as a
unique disorder termed ‘combined pulmonary fibrosis
and emphysema (CPFE)’ [3]. Although Cottin et al. and
Kitaguchi et al. reported case series’ of pathologically
diagnosed CPFE with partial resection of the lungs per￾formed via video-assisted thoracic surgery in 8 out of 61
[3] and 6 out of 47 [4] patients, respectively, the patho￾logical features of these cases do not necessarily facilitate
determination of the complete CPFE picture since the
whole lung was not imaged. Combined emphysema
and fibrotic lesions have been reported with airspace
enlargement with fibrosis (AEF) [5], smoking-related
interstitial fibrosis (SRIF) [6], and respiratory bronchiolitis￾associated interstitial lung disease (RB-ILD) with fibrosis
[7], but do not necessarily complicate fibrosing interstitial
pneumonia and hence do not imply a poor prognosis;
they are considered localised forms of fibrosis with
emphysema [8].
Clinical evaluation to differentiate the characteristics
of pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema is often difficult,
and diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis is important to
evaluate the clinical course, treatment options, and the
risk of acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia in
patients with CPFE. However, no study has examined
whole-lung pathological findings to investigate the asso￾ciation between pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema in
patients with CPFE. The present study was conducted to
evaluate the characteristics of pulmonary fibrosis with
emphysema. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first report of correlations among clinical, radiological,
and whole-lung pathological findings in an autopsy
series of patients with CPFE, and of a comparison of
these findings with those of patients with idiopathic pul￾monary fibrosis (IPF) and emphysema alone.
Methods
Patient selection
Autopsy records of 1455 patients who attended the
Department of Respiratory Medicine, Japanese Red
Cross Medical Centre, Tokyo, Japan, between 1995 and
2011 were reviewed. A total of 186 patients were
pathologically diagnosed with interstitial pneumonia,
emphysema, or lung cancer; IPF and emphysema were
diagnosed by a combination of clinical characteristics,
chest computed tomography (CT) scans, and patho￾logical features using available clinical records and
radiological images [9,10]. Eight of the 186 patients
were diagnosed with IPF alone, 17 with emphysema
alone, and 22 with CPFE due to a combination of IPF
and emphysema [3]. A total of 139 patients were
excluded from the study because there were few available
clinical records or radiological images, or IPF was not
diagnosed: 11 diagnosed with usual interstitial pneumonia
(UIP) and emphysema, 19 with IPF alone, 19 with emphy￾sema alone, 11 with interstitial pneumonia other than
pathological UIP, considered non-UIP, and emphysema, 32
with non-UIP alone, 25 with interstitial pneumonia associ￾ated with the presence of connective tissue disease or any
other cause, and 22 with lung cancer alone.
Assessment personnel
Clinical characteristics were reviewed by 3 respirologists,
chest CT scans were evaluated by 2 radiologists, and
pathological findings were assessed by 2 pathologists
with a focus on interstitial pneumonia with emphysema.
Clinical characteristics
Smoking history, pulmonary function test results, treat￾ment regimen, cause of death, and lung cancer charac￾teristics, including histological type, primary site, clinical
stage, and treatment, were retrospectively reviewed by
consulting clinical charts.
CT scanning protocol
CT scans were obtained with various scanners including
HiSpeed Advantage and HiSpeed FX/i scanners (GE
Healthcare Milwaukee, Wis. USA) and Asteion 4-
section and Aquilion 64-section multidetector scanners
(Toshiba Medical Systems Corporation Tochigi, Japan).
Scans were obtained with the patient in the supine
position at full inspiration. High-resolution CT images
were reconstructed with 1.5–2-mm collimation and
10–20-mm slice intervals, and were obtained from 15
patients with CPFE, 4 patients with IPF alone, and 3
patients with emphysema alone. Contiguous 5–10-mm
collimation (conventional) scan was also obtained.
Intravenous injections of contrast medium were ad￾ministered to almost all patients with lung cancer. All
images were viewed at window settings optimised for
assessment of the lung parenchyma (width, 1200–1500
HU; level, −700 to −600 HU) and mediastinum (width,
300–400 HU; level 30–60 HU).
The CT images were reviewed by 2 radiologists and
final decisions on the findings were reached by consen￾sus. The observers assessed the presence, extent, and
distribution of areas of reticulation, interlobular septal
thickening, honeycombing, architectural distortion, bron￾chiectasis, cystic airspaces, emphysema, ground-glass
attenuation, airspace consolidation, thickening of bronch￾ovascular bundles, parenchymal nodules, lymph node
enlargement, pleural thickening, and pleural effusion.
The definitions of the radiologic findings were based on
the Nomenclature of the Fleischener Society [10].

Clinical and radiological analyses
Patients were diagnosed with CPFE if the following
criteria [3] were met: (1) presence of emphysema on CT
scan, defined as well-demarcated areas of decreased
attenuation in comparison with contiguous normal lung
and marginated by a very thin (<1 mm) or no wall, and/
or multiple bullae (>1 cm) with upper zone predomin￾ance; (2) presence of a diffuse parenchymal lung disease
with significant pulmonary fibrosis on CT scan, defined
as reticular opacities with peripheral and basal predom￾inance, honeycombing, architectural distortion and/or
traction bronchiectasis or bronchiolectasis; and (3) focal
ground-glass opacities and/or areas of alveolar conden￾sation that could be associated but were not prominent.
The pattern of interstitial pneumonia on the CT scans
was examined in accordance with IPF guidelines [9], and
was categorised into 1 of 3 groups—UIP pattern; pos￾sible UIP pattern; and inconsistent with UIP pattern—
because emphysema is not included in the exclusion
criteria for UIP pattern in the IPF guidelines.
IPF was diagnosed based on the following guidelines
[9]: exclusion of other causes of interstitial lung diseases;
the presence of a UIP pattern on CT; and a specific
combination of CT and pathological patterns. Exclusion
criteria were as noted in the IPF guidelines [9]: microno￾dules; extensive ground-glass opacities; consolidation; or a
peribronchovascular-predominant distribution leading to
the consideration of an alternative diagnosis. Additionally,
the presence of connective tissue disease or any other
interstitial lung disease such as drug-induced interstitial
lung disease, pneumoconiosis, hypersensitivity pneumon￾itis, sarcoidosis, pulmonary histiocytosis, lymphangioleio￾myomatosis, and eosinophilic pneumonia was excluded.
Emphysema was defined as above on the basis of CT
scans [3,10]. Centrilobular and paraseptal emphysema
were graded into 3 categories based on the affected lung
area: <25%, 25–50%, and >50% [11].
Thick-walled cystic lesions (TWCLs) were defined
radiologically as cysts measuring at least 1 cm in diam￾eter and delineated by a 1-mm-thick wall in an area of
the lung where reticulation and/or honeycombing was
evident on CT images [12-14].
Almost all patients underwent a final CT scan within
1 month of death, except for 4 emphysema patients for
whom CT scans were performed in the year preceding
death.
Pathological analyses
All the lungs were infused with 10% buffered formalin
through the main bronchi of both the lungs. After fix￾ation for 7 days, the lungs were cut into 1.5-cm thick
coronal or horizontal sections centred around the hilus.
In addition, lesions of interstitial pneumonia, emphy￾sema, and lung cancer were sampled according to chest
CT findings (CT-guided sampling), and over 50 slides
including such lesions as well as normal lung tissues
were prepared in at least 20 cases. After formalin
fixation, histological sections were stained with haema￾toxylin and eosin (HE) and an elastic Van Gieson (EVG)
stain. Pathological features of all patients were assessed
to determine whether there was any correlation with
their CT scans. In accordance with established guidelines
[9], UIP was identified pathologically based on evidence
of marked fibrosis/architectural distortion with or
without honeycombing in a predominantly subpleural/
paraseptal distribution with patchy involvement of
lung parenchyma affected by fibrosis and fibroblastic
foci. Emphysema was defined as abnormal, permanent
enlargement of the airspaces distal to the terminal
bronchiole accompanied by destruction of their walls and
absent or subtle and mild fibrosis [15]. We analysed
centrilobular and paraseptal emphysema in each patient.
TWCLs were pathologically defined as cystic lesions at
the level of membranous bronchiole with dense fibrous
wall, destruction of respiratory bronchiole and alveoli,
and occasional fibroblastic foci. These cystic lesions were
often apposed to honeycomb lesion. We examined the
location and frequency of these cystic lesions throughout
the lobes in cases with CPFE, IPF, and chronic pulmon￾ary emphysema.
Statistical analyses
Differences between groups were compared using
Student’s t-test and the Chi-squared test for numerical
variables, Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables,
and analysis of variance for continuous variables. Stat￾istical analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel
2007 and SPSS 16.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) software.
All values were expressed as the mean ± standard devi￾ation (SD), with 2-tailed p-values <0.05 considered
statistically significant.
Informed consent
This study was approved by the Internal Review Board
of the Japanese Red Cross Medical Centre (#2-2), and
informed consent was obtained from the families of all
patients.
Results
Clinical characteristics
Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. All patients
had a history of heavy smoking. Patients in the CPFE group
were all male, whereas the IPF-alone group included 1
female and 7 male patients, and the emphysema-alone
group included 2 female and 15 male patients. No
patient had a history of exposure to obvious occupa￾tional inhalants. Forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced
vital capacity (FEV1/FVC%) was significantly lower in

the emphysema-alone group compared with the CPFE
and IPF-alone groups. The percent predicted diffusing
capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO%) was
significantly lower in the CPFE group compared with
the IPF-alone and emphysema-alone groups. Fourteen
(63.6%) patients in the CPFE group and 6 (75%) in the
IPF-alone group were treated with corticosteroids for
acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia and acute
respiratory failure at the terminal stage. Six (27.2%)
patients in the CPFE group and 5 (62.5%) in the IPF￾alone group died from acute exacerbation of interstitial
pneumonia; there was no significant between-group dif￾ference. The most common cause of death in the CPFE
and emphysema groups was lung cancer (p = 0.007), but
in the IPF group, it was acute exacerbation of interstitial
pneumonia. Nineteen CPFE patients (86.4%) and 17
(100%) emphysema patients, but only 1 patient in the
IPF-alone group, had lung cancer complications (p <
0.001) (Table 2). No significant differences in histo￾logical type, primary lesion, or lung cancer stage were
noted among the groups. There was trend for CPFE
patients to receive chemotherapy more frequently and
irradiation less frequently than the emphysema-alone
patients.
Clinicoradiological assessment
Representative images of emphysema in the upper lobe
and diffuse parenchymal fibrosis in the lower lobe of the
lungs of patients with CPFE are shown in Figures 1A-C
and 2. Fifteen CPFE patients (68.2%) were diagnosed
with a definite or possible UIP pattern and 7 (31.8%)
with inconsistent with UIP patterns owing to evidence
of peribronchovascular predominance and homogeneity;
8 IPF patients (100%) were diagnosed with definite UIP
pattern (Table 3). TWCLs were observed in 16 (72.7%)
CPFE patients: in the upper lobes of 68.8%, in the lower

lobes of 62.5%, and in both lobes of 40% (Figure 3A).
Enlargement of TWCLs was also observed with progres￾sion of reticulation in 5 of the 16 (31.3%) CPFE patients
with TWCLs (Figure 4A-B). In contrast, TWCLs were not
observed in any patients in the IPF- and emphysema￾alone groups (p = 0.001). No patients with TWCLs had a
history of recurrent pulmonary infection. The prevalence
of honeycombing was 50% among the CPFE patients and
100% among the IPF patients. The prevalence of reticular
opacity and consolidation was significantly higher among
the IPF compared with CPFE patients. A representative
image of the left lower lobe of the lung of a CPFE patient
showing honeycombing with thin walls and the occasional
integration of cysts is shown in Figure 5A. No significant
differences in the type or degree of emphysema were
noted between the groups.
Pathological findings
Lung examination of the CPFE patients revealed emphy￾sema with fibrosis in the upper lobes along with honey￾combing and emphysema in the lower lobes (Figure 2).
Additionally, in all CPFE and IPF-alone patients, diffuse
parenchymal lung disease formed the UIP pattern and
was accompanied by predominantly lower lobe contrac￾tion, honeycombing, and smooth muscle hyperplasia
alternating with normal alveoli.
TWCLs were located in the centriacinar/centrilobular
region, involving one or more acini, membranous and
respiratory bronchioles with destruction of the alveoli
and dense fibrosis of the walls along with occasional
fibroblastic foci. TWCLs made no contribution to the
diagnosis of UIP, however TWCLs were usually apposed
to honeycomb lesion of UIP. TWCLs were observed in
the lower lobes with adjacent normal parenchyma and
honeycombing; importantly, they also continued to areas
of honeycombing (Figures 3B-C, 4C-E). Furthermore,
these cystic lesions were always larger than cysts of
honeycomb lesions. On the other hand, TWCLs in the
upper lobes were often observed with adjacent emphyse￾matous parenchyma. The walls of the TWCLs were
mainly composed of dense collagen; typically, mild
inflammation with a patchy infiltrate of lymphocytes and
plasma cells was present along with occasional fibroblas￾tic foci. Areas with TWCLs were frequently lined by

bronchiolar epithelium. Smooth muscle hyperplasia was
seen in the interstitium as well as honeycombing. While
the prevalence of pathological TWCLs was 72.7% among
CPFE patients, TWCLs were not observed in any patients
in the IPF- and emphysema-alone groups (Table 4).
Furthermore, enlarged honeycomb cysts were observed
in the subpleural area (Figure 5B) in 11 of the 22 (50%)
CPFE patients, while such lesions were not observed in
any patients with IPF-alone group. Pathologically, these
enlarged cysts were 1 ~ 2 cm in size, which are larger than
typical honeycombing and contained some remnant of
lung tissue therein. The walls of enlarged honeycomb cysts
are thin, but perilobular atelectatic fibrosis with smooth
muscle hyperplasia were also observed in the periphery of
these lesions (Figure 5C), as seen in typical honeycomb
lesion of UIP.
The prevalence of fibroblastic foci was significantly
higher among the IPF (75%) compared with CPFE
patients (27.3%) (Table 4). Fibroblastic foci were observed
in the TWCLs of 4 (25%) CPFE patients. Diffuse alveolar
damage was significantly greater in the 6 patients with IPF
without lung cancer (75%) compared with the 6 CPFE
patients (27.3%), 5 of whom had lung cancer and experi￾enced acute exacerbation after chemotherapy.

While no desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP)
patterns were observed, respiratory bronchiolitis was
observed in 3 CPFE patients (13.6%). Additionally, although
we also observed bronchiolocentric fibrosis in 3 CPFE
patients, this finding was neither diffuse nor prominent.
Both centrilobular and paraseptal emphysema were
observed, with centrilobular emphysema predominant
in both groups. Neither diffuse fibrosis nor TWCLs
were observed in the patients with emphysema alone.
Evaluation of CPFE patients with TWCLs
The extent of emphysema in the CPFE patients with
TWCLs was greater than that in the patients without
TWCLs; however, other clinical findings were not
significantly different among the groups (Table 5). Of
the 6 CPFE patients who experienced acute exacerbation
of interstitial pneumonia, 3 (50%) displayed TWCLs, and
of the 15 CPFE patients with TWCLs, the 3 described
above (20%) experienced acute exacerbation of interstitial
pneumonia. Pathological assessment showed that the
prevalence of diffuse alveolar damage was not signi￾ficantly different between CPFE patients with and
without TWCLs.
Discussion
This is the first report of correlations among clinical,
radiological, and whole-lung pathological examinations
in an autopsy series of CPFE. In the present study, we
identified radiological and pathological TWCLs and
described their association with CPFE. No pathological
evidence of radiological TWCLs has yet been reported
in the literature.
CPFE was described by Cottin et al. as a mainly radio￾logical finding characterised by upper-lobe emphysema
and lower-lobe fibrosis [3]; however, it is important to
note that the present study showed a microscopic
combination of fibrotic lesions with emphysema in the
upper lobes and emphysematous lesions with honey￾combing in the lower lobes.
The combination of fibrotic lesions and emphysema
has been classified into 2 groups: diffuse forms of
fibrosis with emphysema, and localised forms of fibro￾sis with emphysema [8]. AEF [5], SRIF [6], and RB-ILD
with fibrosis [7] are categorised as localised forms, and
Katzenstein et al. and Yousem suggested that SRIF and
RB-ILD with fibrosis are not a diffuse fibrosing inter￾stitial pneumonia. Kawabata et al. reported that AEF
could be included as part of the spectrum of SR-ILD
[5]; however, no correlation with radiological features
has been reported thus far.
TWCLs are closely associated with smoking given the
emphysematous destruction of bronchioles and paren￾chyma, and the fibrosis that occurred at the level of the
membranous bronchiole and also respiratory bronchi￾oles observed in the present pathological analysis.
Although localized forms of fibrosis with emphysema
do not appear to be part of diffuse fibrosing interstitial
pneumonia, TWCLs are considered to be associated
with smoking-related fibrosing interstitial pneumonia
by pathological analysis because TWCLs include fibro￾sis and emphysema at the level of membranous and
respiratory bronchioles, and are surrounded by the
pathological diffuse parenchymal fibrosis with adjacent
honeycombing, and sometimes continue to areas of
honeycombing. TWCLs are also characterised by the
combination of pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema
because, radiologically, the extent of emphysema was
greater in CPFE patients with TWCLs compared with
those without such lesions. Moreover, TWCLs were not
observed in patients with IPF or emphysema alone by
both radiological and pathological analysis.
It has been reported that a history of smoking is
present in all CPFE patients, suggesting that it may be a

risk factor for CPFE [3], and smoking is also the major
risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
[16]. In the present study, the median extent of smoking
was 64 pack-years among the CPFE patients, which is
high relative to the 5–73 pack-years reported in previous
studies [17]. There was no significant difference in the
smoking index between CPFE patients with and without
TWCLs. However, the extent of emphysema among the
CPFE patients with TWCLs was greater than that among
patients without TWCLs. Emphysema was included in
the destruction of bronchioles and parenchyma and the
fibrosis at the level of membranous and respiratory
bronchioles of the pathological TWCLs, which may
explain the relationship between TWCLs and smoking.
In addition, it has been reported that only about 15–25%
of smokers develop airflow obstruction, and there is a
substantial component of genetic susceptibility associ￾ated with the development of COPD [18]. Smoking and
genetic polymorphisms have also been identified as
potential risk factors for the development of IPF [19];
therefore, we speculate that there may be differences in
individual susceptibility to the development of TWCLs
or typical CPFE in a unique subset of patients exposed
to smoking.
TWCLs were differentiated from AEF [5], SR-IF [6],
and RB-ILD with fibrosis [7] by the presence of fibro￾blastic foci, their association with fibrosing interstitial
pneumonia and honeycombing, and their size (Table 6).
In the present study, TWCLs containing fibroblastic foci
were confirmed by post-mortem observation of radio￾logically identified TWCLs. Thus, TWCLs are consid￾ered an important radiological/pathological feature of
CPFE. TWCLs are also considered combined lesions of
active parenchymal fibrosis and emphysema and should,
therefore, be managed not only as emphysema, but also
as fibrosing interstitial pneumonia.
Radiological features of CPFE include large, relatively
thick-walled cysts in addition to pulmonary emphysema,
and some large cysts may grow within areas with inter￾stitial pneumonia [14]. In the present study, radiologic￾ally, gradual enlarging of TWCLs simultaneous with
gradual progression of fibrosing interstitial pneumonia
was observed despite smoking cessation in 5 CPFE

patients with TWCLs. This suggests that enlargement of
TWCLs is probably indicative of deterioration of fibros￾ing interstitial pneumonia, and in the present study,
these progressive changes could be observed in parallel.
Occasional fibroblastic foci are present in diffuse
forms of fibrosis and emphysema [8]. Kawabata et al.
reported that the incidence of acute respiratory failure
was 0% in patients with AEF without a UIP pattern,

maybe because AEF is defined without fibroblastic foci
[5]. On the other hand, Katzenstein et al. reported that
fibroblastic foci are included in SRIF [6], but this lesion
is not a diffuse interstitial pneumonia. In the thick￾walled honeycomb of IPF patients, there are significantly
higher percentages of diffuse alveolar damage compared
with the thin-walled type [20]. In the present study, all
CPFE patients with TWCLs were diagnosed with diffuse
forms of fibrosis with emphysema, and a pathological
UIP pattern was observed in all patients; therefore, acute
exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia should be consid￾ered a risk in CPFE patients with TWCLs. However, the
prevalence of acute exacerbation could be lower in CPFE
compared with IPF patients, as is indicated by this study,
because the prevalence of fibroblastic foci and diffuse
alveolar damage was significantly higher in patients with
IPF alone. Further research to determine whether acute
exacerbation is more frequent in patients with IPF alone
compared with CPFE is needed because of the small
number of patients included in this study.
Honeycombing with emphysematous destruction was
observed in half of the CPFE patients, with enlargement
and sometimes thinning of the walls, which also com￾poses the UIP pattern, indicating a pathological charac￾teristic of CPFE. Honeycombing with thin walls and
enlargement have previously been observed in CPFE
patients [1], and we also noted these findings in our
patients. However, these features were not present in
patients who had IPF alone, indicating that emphysema
is the likely cause of the enlargement and thin walls.
Such honeycombing is implicated as a pathological
expression of honeycombing combined with emphy￾sema. According to pathological analysis in the present
study, honeycombing with emphysema is essentially
different from TWCLs because the former is absolutely
honeycombing in a perilobular distribution with fibrosis
of lung parenchyma. On the other hand, TWCLs make
no contribution to the diagnosis of UIP because, in
addition to essential difference from honeycombing, the
membranous bronchiole is implicated as an origin of
TWCLs, and TWCLs involve respiratory and membran￾ous bronchiole lesions in centriacinar/centrilobular dis￾tribution. However, TWCLs are lesions representative
of a combination of fibrosing interstitial pneumonia and
emphysema, and it is importantly demonstrated that
TWCLs coexist with honeycombing and UIP, and
TWCLs sometimes continue to areas of honeycombing.
At HRCT TWCLs represent enlarged cysts with thick
walls even in an area of the lung where honeycombing is
not evident, and honeycombing with emphysema also
represent enlarged cysts with sometimes thin walls only
in an area of honeycombing. Therefore, thickness of the

walls and absence of pre-existing honeycombing could
be differential point between these lesions. However,
radiologically, honeycombing mixed with TWCLs may
mimic honeycombing consisting of enlarged cysts.
Respiratory bronchiolitis is extremely common in
smokers, and was present in 100% of young smokers
examined by Niewoehner et al. [21] in their landmark
paper, and in 100% of current smokers reviewed by
Fraig et al. [22]. Our case series had a very small num￾ber of patients with RB and no patients with RB-ILD;
therefore, there is a discrepancy in the proportion of
patients in whom RB/RB-ILD was identified. Some of
these differences might be explained by formalin inflation
of the lungs and the “washing out” of the pigmented
macrophages [5].
Lung cancer develops more frequently in patients with
IPF and COPD; the reported incidence of lung cancer is
22.4–31.3% in IPF patients [23,24] and 6.8–10.8% in
COPD patients [25]. In the present study, patients who
died from lung cancer diagnosed at autopsy were in￾cluded in the 186 patients because lung cancer was
considered a complication of interstitial pneumonia or
emphysema. Although there is selection bias due to
autopsy series, the lower number of patients with lung
cancer in the IPF-alone group compared with the CPFE
and emphysema-alone groups might be related to the
high prevalence of diffuse alveolar damage among pa￾tients in the IPF-alone group. In this context, the fact
that the number of patients with lung cancer was
significantly lower in the IPF-alone group compared
with the CPFE and emphysema-alone groups suggests
that emphysema could more frequently complicate
lung cancer than pulmonary fibrosis. On the other
hand, lung cancer tended to develop close to areas of
dense fibrosis with architectural distortion in the CPFE
patients, particularly in the 8 (42.1%) patients with
fibrotic lesions and the 4 (21%) patients with TWCLs.
Thus, TWCLs, which are lesions that combine fibrosing
interstitial pneumonia and emphysema, could also be
considered a source of lung cancer development.
Several limitations to the present study warrant men￾tion. First, the present study was subject to selection
bias, because only autopsy series patients who provided
consent for such a study or whose family provided such
consent were evaluated. Second, 14 CPFE patients (77.8%)
were treated with corticosteroids, which could potentially
influence the pathological findings in terms of the patterns
of pulmonary fibrosis and the number of fibroblastic
foci. Third, pulmonary hypertension (PH), one of the
most severe complications of CPFE, was not examined,
because right heart catheterisation could only be
assessed for a PH diagnosis in one patient due to the
need for an invasive investigation. Right heart catheter￾isation remains the ‘gold standard’ for the diagnosis of
PH, but in clinical practice non-invasive investigations
are performed for most patients. Fourth, a pathological
UIP pattern of interstitial pneumonia was observed in
all patients in the CPFE and IPF-alone groups in the
present study. Patients with non-UIP patterns with or
without emphysema and secondary interstitial pneumo￾nia were excluded, and so patients with pathological
UIP and non-UIP or secondary interstitial pneumonia
could not be compared.
CPFE illustrates the limitations of a simplistic diagnostic
dichotomy between lung emphysema and fibrosis because
CPFE is diagnosed with radiological criteria. Although
TWCLs may be misunderstood as lesions of solely
emphysematous changes radiologically, they were only
observed in CPFE patients and were considered combined
lesions of active parenchymal fibrosis and emphysema by
pathological evaluation. Thus, the evaluation of TWCLs
contributes to the diagnosis, treatment, complication,
prognosis, and the risk of acute exacerbation of interstitial
pneumonia in CPFE patients.
Conclusions
In the present autopsy series, TWCLs were only ob￾served in the CPFE patients. TWCLs are considered to
be associated with fibrosing interstitial pneumonia and
emphysema, and should be considered an important
radiological and pathological feature of CPFE.
