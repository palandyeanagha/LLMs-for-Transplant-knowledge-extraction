Background and aims: We followed a population based cohort of patients with inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD) from Olmsted County, Minnesota, in order to analyse long term survival and cause specific
mortality.
Material and methods: A total of 692 patients were followed for a median of 14 years. Standardised
mortality ratios (SMRs, observed/expected deaths) were calculated for specific causes of death. Cox
proportional hazards regression was used to determine if clinical variables were independently associated
with mortality.
Results: Fifty six of 314 Crohn’s disease patients died compared with 46.0 expected (SMR 1.2 (95%
confidence interval (CI) 0.9–1.6)), and 62 of 378 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients died compared with 79.2
expected (SMR 0.8 (95% CI 0.6–1.0)). Eighteen patients with Crohn’s disease (32%) died from disease
related complications, and 12 patients (19%) died from causes related to UC. In Crohn’s disease, an
increased risk of dying from non-malignant gastrointestinal causes (SMR 6.4 (95% CI 3.2–11.5)),
gastrointestinal malignancies (SMR 4.7 (95% CI 1.7–10.2)), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) (SMR 3.5 (95% CI 1.3–7.5)) was observed. In UC, cardiovascular death was reduced (SMR 0.6
(95% CI 0.4–0.9)). Increased age at diagnosis and male sex were associated with mortality in both
subtypes. In UC but not Crohn’s disease, a diagnosis after 1980 was associated with decreased mortality.
Conclusions: In this population based study of IBD patients from North America, overall survival was
similar to that expected in the US White population. Crohn’s disease patients were at increased risk of
dying from gastrointestinal disease and COPD whereas UC patients had a decreased risk of
cardiovascular death.
P
opulation based data are still sparse and conflicting
when it comes to long term survival in patients with
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In Crohn’s disease, a
slight decrease in life expectancy has been described in
studies with follow up ending in the 1970s,1 2 1980s,3 4 and
1990s.5–8 The increased mortality was associated with female
sex,6 long disease duration,6 and disease location,9 and was
further ascribed to an increased risk of dying from pulmonary
cancer,10 genitourinary tract diseases,6 and gastrointestinal,
liver, and biliary diseases.5 6 10 Three studies, however,
reported normal survival in patients with Crohn’s dis￾ease.9 11 12 In contrast, the majority of population based
studies have shown normal or even improved survival among
ulcerative colitis (UC) patients compared with the general
population.8 9 13–18 These findings have been ascribed to
decreased mortality from cardiovascular diseases10 and non￾gastrointestinal cancer, especially lung cancer.10 However,
four Scandinavian studies4 5 19 20 reported slightly to 40%
reduced survival among UC patients due to increased
mortality from gastrointestinal diseases (including UC),5 19
hepatobiliary diseases,5 colorectal cancer,4 5 chronic lung
diseases,4 5 pulmonary embolism,18 and suicide.18
The majority of the aforementioned studies however do not
account for recent changes in the management of IBD
patients, especially the introduction of new immunosuppres￾sive medications. We therefore aimed to: (1) re-evaluate
survival in a population based IBD cohort from Olmsted
County, Minnesota, after extension of the observation period
by a decade to the year 2004; (2) analyse, for the first time,
the cause specific mortality in IBD patients from the USA
compared with the general population; and (3) determine if
clinical variables were associated with mortality.
METHODS
Patient cohort
Olmsted County, situated in southeastern Minnesota, had a
population of 124 277 inhabitants in the 2000 US Census.
The majority of people reside in Rochester, which is the urban
centre of an otherwise rural county. Eighty nine per cent are
non-Hispanic White, and a substantial portion is of northern
European heritage. Although 25% of county residents are
employed in health care services (versus 8% nationwide), and
the level of education is consequently higher (30% of adults
have completed college versus 21% nationwide), the residents
of Olmsted County are otherwise socioeconomically similar to
the US White population.21
The study cohort comprised 692 Olmsted County residents
first diagnosed with IBD (314 Crohn’s disease and 378 UC)
between 1940 and 2001, according to well defined criteria, as
described previously.7 17 22 All patients were followed from
diagnosis until emigration, death, or the end of the study (31
May 2004).

Treatment policy
During the entire observation period, patients diagnosed with
IBD were followed by gastroenterologists or internists at one
of two medical centres within the county. Patients under￾went periodic (usually annual) evaluations, and some
patients received maintenance therapy with 5-aminosalicy￾lates (5-ASA). From the early 1990s, azathioprine and 6-
mercaptopurine (6-MP) were used as alternatives to 5-ASA.
In the mid 1990s, treatment with methotrexate was
introduced, and infliximab has been used as maintenance
therapy in a few cases since 1999. Short term oral
corticosteroid treatment has been used for episodes or
worsening of symptoms, at initial doses of 30–60 mg
prednisone daily that were usually tapered and discontinued
over 2–3 months. Surgical resections have been performed
for obstructive symptoms and for failure to respond to
medical therapy. The practice of periodic colonoscopic
surveillance with biopsies for UC patients with longstanding
extensive colitis became widespread in the 1980s, and this
practice was extended to left sided colitis and Crohn’s colitis
at a later date.
Follow up and registration of deaths
As medical care is practically self contained within Olmsted
County and provided by the Mayo Medical Centre, the
Olmsted Medical Centre, and their affiliated clinics and
hospitals, it is possible to trace all IBD patients in the
common medical record linkage system (Rochester
Epidemiology Project).21 Complete (inpatient and outpatient)
medical files in the community were reviewed to determine
end of follow up due to emigration or death. For all patients
who had died, death certificates were retrieved in order to
register the underlying cause of death according to the
International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9), and hospital
records were examined to confirm the cause and to reveal any
relation to IBD.
Statistical analysis
Cumulative survival in the cohort was calculated from the
date of IBD diagnosis to the last follow up using the Kaplan￾Meier product limit method, and compared with expected
survival (based on mortality figures for the 1960–2000 US
White background population) using the one sample log rank
test. For specific causes of deaths, standardised mortality
ratios (SMRs) for observed compared with expected deaths
were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Expected
numbers of deaths were calculated according to person years
at risk in the cohort and age and sex matched cause of death
figures from the US White population (1960–2000). SMR
analysis was stratified by age at IBD diagnosis (0–18 years,
19–29 years, 30–49 years, >50 years), calendar period of IBD
diagnosis (1940–1959, 1960–1979, 1980–2001), and by
immunosuppressive/biological medication usage (any use of
azathioprine, 6-MP, methotrexate, or infliximab versus
none). Confidence intervals excluding 1.0 were considered
statistically significant (p,0.05). To determine if age at
diagnosis (five year increments), sex, calendar period of
diagnosis, or maximal disease extent were independent
predictors of mortality, we used Cox proportional hazards
regression analysis for each subtype of IBD, using time to
death as the dependent variable. These results were expressed
as hazards ratios (HR) with their 95% CI.
RESULTS
A total of 692 Olmsted County residents with IBD were
observed for a total of 11 307 person years, with a median
follow up time of 14 years (range 7 days–58 years). Crohn’s
disease patients (159 women and 155 men) contributed 4946

person years of observational time and were followed for a
median of 13 years (range 7 days–54 years). The maximal
extent of Crohn’s disease involvement was small bowel in 91
patients (29%), colonic in 93 (30%), and ileocolonic in 130
(41%). Among 21 Crohn’s disease patients diagnosed
between 1940 and 1959, none received immunosuppressives
or biological agents during their clinical course, while 13 of
116 patients (11%) diagnosed between 1960 and 1979 and 65
of 177 patients (37%) diagnosed between 1980 and 2001
received one of these agents at some point in their clinical
course. UC patients (166 women and 212 men) were followed
for 6360 person years, or a median of 15 years (range
25 days–58 years). The maximal extent of UC involvement
was proctitis in 64 patients (17%), left sided colitis in 134
(35%), and extensive in 179 (47%). (The extent was
unknown in one UC patient.) None of the 34 UC patients
diagnosed between 1940 and 1959 received immunosuppres￾sive agents or biological agents during their clinical course,
while five of 143 patients (3%) diagnosed between 1960 and
1979 and 41 of 201 patients (20%) diagnosed between 1980
and 2001 received at least one of these agents. The relation￾ship between subtype of IBD, age, sex, and calendar year at
diagnosis is shown in table 1.
Overall survival
Crohn’s disease
Among 314 patients with Crohn’s disease, 56 deaths were
observed compared with 46.0 expected (SMR 1.2 (95% CI
0.9–1.6)). Twenty six women died compared with 22.1
expected (SMR 1.2 (95% CI 0.8–1.7)) and 30 men compared
with 23.9 expected (SMR 1.3 (95% CI 0.9–1.8)). Median age
at death was 79 years (range 34–95) in women and 70 years
(range 29–93) in men.
When SMR values for Crohn’s disease were stratified by
age at diagnosis, there did not appear to be any significant
differences. SMR for Crohn’s disease patients aged 0–
18 years at diagnosis was 1.1 (95% CI 0.03–6.4), 1.1 (95%
CI 0.4–2.6) for patients aged 19–29 years, 1.3 (95% CI 0.8–
2.0) for patients aged 30–49 years, and 1.2 (95% CI 0.8–1.7)
for those >50 years old at diagnosis. Similarly, the risk of
dying was not significantly associated with calendar year at
diagnosis: SMR for Crohn’s disease patients diagnosed
between 1940 and 1959 was 0.9 (95% CI 0.5–1.5), 1.4 (95%
CI 0.9–2.1) for those diagnosed between 1960 and 1979, 1.7
(95% CI 0.8–3.2) for patients diagnosed between 1980 and
1989, and 1.2 (95% CI 0.5–2.3) for patients diagnosed
between 1990 and 2001 (p>0.19 when comparing any two
of four time periods). Among 78 Crohn’s disease patients
who had record of use of 6-MP, azathioprine, methotrexate,
or infliximab, there were four deaths versus 4.29 expected
(SMR 0.9 (95% CI 0.3–2.4)). Among the 236 patients with no
record of use of these medications, 52 patients died versus
41.71 expected (SMR 1.3 (95% CI 0.9–1.6)).
Cumulative survival among Crohn’s disease patients after
10 years was 91% (95% CI 88–95%)) versus 94% expected,
82% (95% CI 77–87%) versus 86% expected after 20 years,
73% (95% CI 65–81%) versus 74% expected after 30 years,
and 48% (95% CI 30–65%) versus 61% expected after 40 years
(fig 1). Thus there was a suggestion of decreased survival in
Crohn’s disease patients but the reduction was not statisti￾cally significant (one sample log rank test, p = 0.13).
Ulcerative colitis
A total of 62 deaths occurred in 378 UC patients, compared
with 79.2 expected (SMR 0.8 (95% CI 0.6–1.0)). Twenty six
women died versus 36.3 expected (SMR 0.7 (95% CI

0.5–1.1)), and 36 men died versus 42.9 expected (SMR 0.8
(95% CI 0.6–1.2)). Median age at death was 81 years (range
38–97) in women and 71 years (range 26–92) in men.
Observed mortality was less than expected in all age strata
but this was not as prominent among patients aged
>50 years at diagnosis. None of the patients aged 0–18 years
at UC diagnosis died versus 1.01 expected (SMR 0 (95% CI 0–
3.6)) while three patients aged 19–29 years died versus 7.23
expected (SMR 0.4 (95% CI 0.1–1.2)). Fourteen patients aged
30–49 years at diagnosis died versus 22.2 expected (SMR 0.6
(95% CI 0.3–1.0)), and 45 patients aged >50 years died
versus 48.3 expected (SMR 0.9 (95% CI 0.7–1.3)). When
stratified by calendar year at diagnosis, survival appeared to
improve over time. SMR was 0.8 (95% CI 0.5–1.3) for UC
patients diagnosed between 1940 and 1959, 0.9 (95% CI 0.6–
1.2) for those diagnosed between 1960 and 1979, 0.7 (95% CI
0.3–1.3) for patients diagnosed between 1980 and 1989, and
0.5 (95% CI 0.1–1.3) for those diagnosed between 1990 and
2001. Yet there were no statistically significant differences
between any two of the four period specific SMRs (p>0.19
for all six comparisons). Among 46 patients who had received
6-MP, azathioprine, methotrexate, or infliximab, there were
three deaths versus 2.28 expected (SMR 1.3 (95% CI 0.3–
3.8)). Among 332 UC patients who did not receive these
medications, 59 died versus 76.88 expected (SMR 0.8 (95% CI
0.6–0.99)).
In contrast with Crohn’s disease, UC patients had a slightly
better cumulative survival than expected (fig 2): 93% (95% CI
91–96%) versus 92% expected after 10 years, 85% (95% CI
80–89%) versus 82% expected after 20 years, 72% (95% CI
65–79%) versus 68% expected after 30 years, and 59% (95%
CI 48–70%) versus 53% expected after 40 years (one sample
log rank test, p = 0.06).
Inflammatory bowel disease specific mortality
Crohn’s disease
A total of 18 deaths (32%) among patients with Crohn’s
disease were definitely or possibly related to the underlying
disease (table 2). Eight (44%) were women. Median age at
Crohn’s disease diagnosis for these patients was 40.5 years
(range 13–77), and median age at death was 54.5 years
(range 17–77). Seven patients died from causes related to
severe fistulising Crohn’s disease (that is, intra-abdominal
abscesses, peritonitis, and short bowel syndrome after
surgery for internal fistulae). One patient, a 35 year old
woman recently treated with infliximab, died of sepsis after
surgery for an internal fistula. In three patients, death was
related to primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), as two died
from end stage liver disease due to PSC and one died from
cholangiocarcinoma of the hepatic bile ducts and concurrent
haemorrhagic pancreatitis. Whether the disease phenotype in
these three patients, described as ileocolonic Crohn’s disease,
could in some cases have been UC with backwash ileitis is
uncertain. Six patients (three women and three men) died
from intestinal cancer, thus accounting for 10% of all deaths
in Crohn’s disease patients.
Ulcerative colitis
Among patients with UC, 12 deaths (19%) could be ascribed
to the underlying disease (table 3). These 12 patients (25%
women) had a median age at diagnosis of 47 years (range
26–87) and a median age at death of 62.5 years (26–91).
Seven patients died from severe UC, in most cases pancolitis,
with complications such as perforation, intestinal haemor￾rhage, and postoperative acute myocardial infarction or
sepsis. Only one patient (2% of all deaths in UC patients)
died from end stage liver disease due to PSC. Lastly, five
patients died from metastatic colorectal cancer, causing 8% of
all deaths in patients with UC.
Cause specific mortality
Crohn’s disease
The slightly increased mortality from Crohn’s disease could
be explained by an increased risk of dying from gastro￾intestinal disease and cancer, primarily due to the Crohn’s
disease related deaths described above (table 4). In 11
patients, death was classified as due to gastrointestinal
disease (ICD-9 codes 520–579) compared with 1.7 expected
(SMR 6.4 (95% CI 3.2–12)). In six patients, the cause of death
was classified as gastrointestinal malignancy (ICD-9 codes
152–154) versus 1.3 expected (SMR 4.7 (95% CI 1.7–10)). No
significant difference in risk was observed when stratifying
by sex.
Patients with Crohn’s disease were also at increased risk of
dying from COPD (ICD-9 codes 490–496), as six patients died
versus 1.7 expected (SMR 3.5 (95% CI 1.3–7.5)). Notably, no
patient died from leukaemia (0.4 deaths expected) and only
one patient died in 1991 from lymphoma, which was located
in the small intestine and classified as an intestinal
malignancy.

Ulcerative colitis
In UC patients, cause specific mortality was not significantly
increased in any subcategory (table 5). Despite the 12 deaths
ascribed to UC, the risk of dying from gastrointestinal
diseases (SMR 2.0 (95% CI 0.8–4.4)) or gastrointestinal
cancer (SMR 2.2 (95% CI 0.7–5.2)) was not significantly
increased.
In contrast with this, a decreased risk of dying from
cardiovascular diseases (ICD-9 codes 390–459) was observed
among all UC patients (SMR 0.6 (95% CI 0.4–0.9)) and in
women in particular (SMR 0.4 (95% CI 0.2–0.9)). Two
patients (both males) with UC died from leukaemia versus
0.7 expected (SMR 3.0 (95% CI 0.4–11)). One died in 1971
from acute myelomonocytic leukaemia with disseminated
intravascular coagulation, and one who had coexistent PSC
died in 1992 from chronic lymphatic leukaemia. No patients
died from lymphoma.
Cox proportional hazards regression
For Crohn’s disease, age was independently associated with
mortality (HR 1.6 per five year increment (95% CI 1.4–1.7)).
There was a trend for male sex to be associated with mortality
(HR 1.7) but this did not quite meet statistical significance
(95% CI 0.98–3.1). Using patients diagnosed between 1940
and 1959 as the reference, being diagnosed in 1960–79 (HR
1.6 (95% CI 0.7–3.4)) or 1980–2001 (HR 1.1 (95% CI 0.5–2.8))
were not independently associated with mortality. Using
patients with colonic involvement only as the reference
group, having isolated small bowel involvement (HR 0.8
(95% CI 0.4–1.6)) or ileocolonic involvement (HR 0.8 (95% CI
0.4–1.7)) were also not significantly associated with mortal￾ity.
For UC, both age (HR 1.7 per five year increment (95% CI
1.5–1.9)) and male sex (HR 2.0 (95% CI 1.2–3.4)) were
independently associated with mortality. Using patients
diagnosed in the 1940–1959 period as the reference group,
being diagnosed in the 1960–79 period was not indepen￾dently associated with mortality (HR 0.6 (95% CI 0.3–1.1)),
but being diagnosed in the 1980–2002 period was signifi￾cantly associated with decreased mortality (HR 0.2 (95% CI
0.1–0.6)). Using ulcerative proctitis patients as the reference
group, having left sided colitis was not significantly
associated with mortality (HR 0.9 (95% CI 0.4–2.3)) while
having extensive colitis was associated with mortality (HR
2.2) although this did not quite meet statistical significance
(95% CI 0.9–5.1).
DISCUSSION
The present long term follow up study of a population based
inception cohort of patients with IBD from the USA revealed
an almost unchanged pattern of survival during the past six
decades. In Crohn’s disease, overall mortality was slightly
increased due to deaths from gastrointestinal disease and
gastrointestinal malignancies. In contrast, overall survival in
UC was slightly greater than expected due to decreased
mortality from cardiovascular diseases. No increased risk of
dying from leukaemia or lymphomas was observed. Multiple
variable analysis suggested that older age at diagnosis and
male sex were associated with mortality. Being diagnosed
with UC after 1980 was associated with decreased mortality
in multiple variable analysis, but the same was not seen for
Crohn’s disease.
All patients derived from a well defined geographic region,
Olmsted County, and were included in the cohort according
to strict international diagnostic criteria.7 17 22 All death
certificates were retrieved, and the causes of death were
verified in the regional medical record linkage system (the
Rochester Epidemiology Project), which provides access to all
local medical records and assures a high level of clinical
detail. However, the relatively small number of patients and
low frequency of events observed in the present study may
veil differences in risk estimates in subsets of patients. It can
also be questioned whether Olmsted County is representative
of the general US population due to the relatively high
percentage of Whites in the region studied and their
somewhat greater education level.
In the present study, we observed a trend towards
decreased survival among patients with Crohn’s disease
compared with an age and sex matched background
population, and 32% of deaths were ascribed to the under￾lying disease, similar to the percentage observed in
Copenhagen County, Denmark.6 Crohn’s disease related
deaths resulted in an excess risk of dying from gastrointest￾inal disease and cancer, as observed also in Italy and
Scandinavia.5 6 10 Although the majority of Crohn’s disease
related deaths occurred in patients diagnosed before the

1990s, overall survival remained unchanged during the
following decade of observation. One may speculate that
introduction of new treatment strategies has improved
survival from Crohn’s disease itself, but has led to an
increased risk of dying from other causes (long term adverse
events). When we directly compared relative mortality
between patients who received immunosuppressive agents
and those who did not, we could see no significant
differences. In a retrospective, non-randomised study, how￾ever, any potential benefit of these agents could have been
masked by the fact that patients with more severe disease
were receiving them. In the present study, the death of one
patient had a possible relation to anti-tumour necrosis factor
a treatment, but no patient died from opportunistic infection
or lymphoma due to treatment with these drugs. For
comparison, a recent population based study from
Stockholm County, Sweden, suggested an increased mortal￾ity in IBD patients treated with infliximab due to fatal
adverse events such as lymphomas, opportunistic infections,
and postoperative complications, but the expected number of
deaths from an age and sex matched background population
or non-infliximab treated IBD population were lacking.23 A
preliminary report from the TREAT registry (a registry
maintained by Ovation Research and funded by Centocor
Inc.) suggested that an increased risk of serious infections
and death in Crohn’s disease patients is attributable to
treatment with prednisone rather than infliximab.24 Future
prospective population based studies are required to evaluate
the long term effect of treatment with new biological
modifiers on survival in Crohn’s disease patients.
Furthermore, an increased risk of dying from COPD was
observed in patients with Crohn’s disease, which is in
accordance with the high frequency of smokers among
Crohn’s disease patients compared with unaffected indivi￾duals.25 Thus as disease activity and chronic lung disease are the
major contributors to mortality in this patient group, and since
they are both related to the use of tobacco, it is essential not only
to encourage Crohn’s disease patients to quit smoking but also
to provide relevant assistance to overcome the dependency.
In UC patients from Olmsted County, overall survival was
not affected, in accordance with several population based
studies from Europe.8 9 13–16 18 Indeed, survival even seemed to
improve slightly over the six decades of observation. Thus the
initially reported poor prognosis in UC26 is again not
confirmed, leading one to conclude that UC patients should
not be denied access to reasonably priced medical and life
insurance policies. The 19% of deaths which had a certain or
possible relation to UC were counterbalanced by a decreased
risk of dying from cardiovascular diseases. This is in
accordance with an older study from the UK26 and a recent
study from Italy,10 and is possibly explained by the low
frequency of cigarette smoking among UC patients combined
with a lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure in UC
patients compared with controls (probably due to sodium
and water depletion in patients with extensive colitis or
ileostomy).27 Interestingly, only 8% of deaths among UC
patients were caused by colorectal cancer (CRC) in contrast
with the one sixth cited in a recent meta-analysis of CRC in
selected and unselected UC cohorts.28 The low cancer
mortality in UC is in accordance with the findings of a
recent population based study from Copenhagen,18 and is of
important prognostic value. We recently described the low
incidence of CRC among Olmsted County residents with
IBD.29 The relative risk of CRC in UC was 1.1, and the
cumulative incidence of CRC after 25 years of disease was
only 2%. In Crohn’s disease, the relative risk of CRC was 1.9,
but not significantly different from that expected, and the
cumulative risk of CRC was 2.4% after 25 years of disease.
Perhaps a combination of surveillance colonoscopy, procto￾colectomy (25 year cumulative risks of 20.8% and 10.4% for
UC and Crohn’s disease, respectively), and more widespread
use of 5-ASA derivates have led to this apparent decline in
CRC incidence. Future studies should address the influence
of strict treatment policies, surgical interventions, and close
follow up of UC patients on low CRC incidence and mortality.
In conclusion, this population based study of IBD patients
from North America revealed a relatively stable survival
pattern during the past six decades. Cause specific mortality
seemed related to differences in smoking habits, as increased
mortality from gastrointestinal diseases and COPD was
observed in Crohn’s disease whereas decreased mortality
from cardiovascular disease was observed in UC. An active
and structured approach to Crohn’s disease patients regard￾ing cessation of smoking is required.
