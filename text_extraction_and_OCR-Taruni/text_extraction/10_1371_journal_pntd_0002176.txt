Abstract
Background: Sudden death has been considered the main cause of death in patients with Chagas heart disease.
Nevertheless, this information comes from a period before the introduction of drugs that changed the natural history of
heart failure. We sought to study the mode of death of patients with heart failure caused by Chagas heart disease,
comparing with non-Chagas cardiomyopathy.
Methods and results: We examined the REMADHE trial and grouped patients according to etiology (Chagas vs non-Chagas)
and mode of death. The primary end-point was all-cause, heart failure and sudden death mortality; 342 patients were
analyzed and 185 (54.1%) died. Death occurred in 56.4% Chagas patients and 53.7% non-Chagas patients. The cumulative
incidence of all-cause mortality and heart failure mortality was significantly higher in Chagas patients compared to non￾Chagas. There was no difference in the cumulative incidence of sudden death mortality between the two groups. In the Cox
regression model, Chagas etiology (HR 2.76; CI 1.34–5.69; p = 0.006), LVEDD (left ventricular end diastolic diameter) (HR 1.07;
CI 1.04–1.10; p,0.001), creatinine clearance (HR 0.98; CI 0.97–0.99; p = 0.006) and use of amiodarone (HR 3.05; CI 1.47–6.34;
p = 0.003) were independently associated with heart failure mortality. LVEDD (HR 1.04; CI 1.01–1.07; p = 0.005) and use of
beta-blocker (HR 0.52; CI 0.34–0.94; p = 0.014) were independently associated with sudden death mortality.
Conclusions: In severe Chagas heart disease, progressive heart failure is the most important mode of death. These data
challenge the current understanding of Chagas heart disease and may have implications in the selection of treatment
choices, considering the mode of death.

Introduction
Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis) remains a burden for
public health systems in Latin American countries [1]. In fact,
the global prevalence of Chagas disease has reached 9 million
people and 25 million are estimated to be at risk worldwide [2].
As a result of globalization and migration, non-endemic
countries have reported an increase in the prevalence of Chagas
disease. It has been estimated that 47,000 T. cruzi-infected
persons are now living in Spain and another 300,000 in the
United States [3].
Sudden death has been considered the main cause of death in
patients with Chagas heart disease [4]. Nevertheless, this
information comes mainly from a period before the introduction
of drugs that changed the natural history of heart failure such as
beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)
and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB). Furthermore, many
studies that support this finding include heterogeneous cohorts of
patients, in particular patients without ventricular dysfunction [4].
To the best of our knowledge there is not a recent publication
studying the mode of death in Chagas heart disease. The
management of Chagas heart disease is complex and includes
the treatment of complex arrhythmias and heart failure. The
precise understanding of current natural history of patients
presenting systolic dysfunction is indispensable to plan adequate
health politics and improve survival. Therefore, we sought to study
the mode of death of patients with heart failure caused by Chagas
heart disease, comparing with non-Chagas cardiomyopathy.
Materials and Methods
Patients
We examined the patients included in the REMADHE
(Repetitive Education at Six-Month Intervals and Monitoring
PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | www.plosntds.org 1 April 2013 | Volume 7 | Issue 4 | e2176

for Adherence in Heart Failure Outpatients) trial; For the purpose
of current study, patients were grouped according to etiology
(Chagas vs non-Chagas groups) and mode of death.
REMADHE is a prospective, randomized, single-center open
parallel trial controlled by nonintervention simple randomization
and designed to compare a disease management program versus
control in patients with chronic heart failure. Patients enrolled in
the study were under ambulatory care in a tertiary referral center
and were followed by a cardiologist with experience in heart
failure. Inclusion elapsed from October 1999 until January 2005.
Patients were aged 18 years or older with irreversible chronic heart
failure of at least 6-months. Exclusion criteria included patients’
inability to attend educational sessions and researchers’ inability to
monitor patients because of the patients’ lack of transportation,
social or communication barriers; myocardial infarction or
unstable angina within 6 months before randomization; cardiac
surgery or angioplasty within 6 months before randomization;
hospitalized patients or recently discharged patients; any severe
systemic disease that could impair expected survival; procedures
that could influence follow-up; pregnancy or childbearing
potential (figure 1). The REMADHE trial demonstrated that a
disease management program was associated with reduction in
unplanned hospitalization, total hospital days and need for
emergency care, as well as improved quality of life [5,6].
Definitions
Patients were divided into two groups: Chagas and non-Chagas.
The diagnosis of Chagas disease was based on epidemiological
information along with serological tests (indirect immunofluores￾cence, passive haemaglutination, immunoenzymatic assay) positive
for Trypanosoma cruzi [7]. Patients with an alternative diagnosis, or
a mixed etiology for the cardiomyopathy were included in non￾Chagas group.
All deaths were classified according to specified definitions. The
agreement of two members of the study on the cause of death was
mandatory. Sudden death was defined as an unexpected death
occurred within 1 hour of the onset of new symptoms or occurred
unwitnessed in a previously stable patient [8].
Heart failure death was defined as a death that occurred
because of worsening or intractable heart failure, which included
cardiogenic shock, pulmonary edema and terminal arrhythmias
during hospital stay for aggravated heart failure.
Other cardiovascular death was defined as a death that
occurred after a cerebrovascular accident, vascular disease,
myocardial infarction or cardiovascular procedure. Cerebrovas￾cular accident was defined as a persistent disturbance of
neurological function. Diagnosis required characteristic history,
physical examination, imaging techniques and/or autopsy data.
Myocardial infarction (MI) death was defined as a death that
occurred after a verified acute MI. Noncardasiovcular death was
defined as a death resulting from a noncardiac reason. Unknown
death was defined as a death that did not have a definitive cause.
Patients were categorized according to the New York Heart
Association functional class [9] during evaluation of the medical
staff of our heart failure clinic.
End Point
The primary end-point of the study was all-cause, heart failure
and sudden death mortality that were obtained during follow-up,
either from the trial database, from review of medical records or
by telephone contact with family members. Additionally, Cox
proportional-hazards regression models were used to explore the
relationship of mode of death, etiology and other variables with
survival time. For Cox proportional hazards model, each mode of
death is looked at in turn and all other modes of death are
censored.
Statistical Analysis
Results are presented as frequencies, mean (SD), or median
(interquartile range), as appropriate. For effects of group
comparison, the t test was used for normal distribution and
Mann-Whitney test was used to compare variables without normal
distribution. For categorical variables, chi-square test or the Fisher
exact test was applied. Survival was estimated by the Kaplan–
Meier method, and differences in survival between groups were
assessed by the log-rank test. Cox proportional-hazards models
were used to compare the rates of deaths for each mode of
mortality. In the analysis, data on patients was censored at the
time of implantation of a defibrillator or the time of heart
transplantation. All analyses and graphs were performed with
SPSS statistical software version 13.0 and Graphpad Prism
software version 5.0.,
Ethics Statement
The study protocol was approved by the institutional ethics
committee of Hospital das Clinicas da Faculdade de Medicina da
Universidade de Sao Paulo and all patients provided written
informed consent. All data analyzed were anonymized.
Results
A total of 412 patients were enrolled in the REMADHE trial.
For the purpose of the current study, we excluded patients with left
ventricular ejection fraction $50% (60 patients) and those who
had ICD (10 patients) and we censored nine patients at the time of
implantation of a defibrillator. Thus, 342 patients were analyzed.
The first inclusion occurred in October 1999, and patients were
followed until February 2010 with a mean follow-up of 1,284
days6895 days. Despite our cohort included 342 patients, we have
information about New York Heart Association functional class
(NYHA FC) only in 296 patients. Baseline characteristics of the
patients are described in table 1.
As compared to non-Chagas, Chagas patients had lower body
mass index, smaller end-diastolic left ventricle diameter, and
smaller proportion of patients under beta-blocker therapy. Chagas
Author Summary
Chagas disease remains a burden for public health systems
in Latin American countries. Several authors believe that
sudden death is the main cause of death in this
population. So many efforts have been made to prevent
sudden death in Chagas disease. In order to verify if
sudden death is the leading cause of death in Chagasic
heart failure, we performed a subanalysis of the REMADHE
prospective trial, which included a population of outpa￾tients in a tertiary referral center for heart failure. We
grouped patients according to etiology (Chagas vs non￾Chagas) and modes of death that were classified as
progressive heart failure death, sudden death, other
cardiovascular death, noncardiovascular death or un￾known death. Our study showed that in this end of the
spectrum of presentation of Chagas disease, with systolic
heart dysfunction, progressive heart failure is the main
mode of death. These data have implications for the
development of new strategies for prevention of chagasic
heart failure.

patients also had higher proportion of females and larger left
ventricular ejection fraction (Table 1).
Chagas patients had a higher incidence of death related to
cerebrovascular accident and non-cardiovascular deaths. They
also had a higher number of hospitalizations and long-term
hospital stay (Table 2).
All-Cause, Heart Failure and Sudden Death Mortality
Analysis
Altogether 185 (54.1%) patients died. Death occurred in 31
(56.4%) Chagas patients and 154 (53.7%) non-Chagas patients.
Kaplan-Meier cumulative event curves for all-cause, heart
failure and sudden death mortality are shown in Figures 2, 3
and 4.
The cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality was higher in
patients with Chagas heart disease compared to non-Chagas
patients (figure 2). Additionally, the cumulative incidence of heart
failure mortality was higher in Chagas patients compared to non￾Chagas (figure 3). Nevertheless, when we analyzed the cumulative
incidence of sudden death mortality, there was no difference
between the two groups (figure 4).
The influence of etiology on heart failure and sudden death
mortality was further evaluated by Cox proportional-hazards
regression. As we have information about New York Heart
Association functional class (NYHA FC) only in 296 patients, we
did two different models of Cox proportional-hazards regression;
Model 1 without information about NYHA FC and Model 2
including NYHA FC (I/II vs III/IV). Other variables included

were age, gender, etiology (Chagas vs non-Chagas), use of beta￾blocker, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or
angiotensin II receptor blocker, use of amiodarone, use of
spironolactone, body mass index, left ventricular ejection fraction,
left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDD), group allocated
(disease management program versus control), hemoglobin, serum
sodium, creatinine clearance, number of hospitalizations, days of
hospitalization and number of admissions to emergency care.
Chagas etiology, LVEDD, creatinine clearance and use of
amiodarone were independently associated with heart failure
mortality on Model 1 and Model 2 (table 3). On the other
hand, LVEDD and use of beta-blocker were independently
associated with sudden death mortality on both Models 1 and 2
(table 4).
Concerning the toxic effects of amiodarone, it is important to
highlight that none patient died from lung toxicity.

Severity of Heart Failure and Mode of Death
The relationship between mode of death and NYHA functional
class at randomization was analyzed for each etiology. As
mentioned before, information about NYHA functional class
was available in 296 (87%) patients.
In patients with Chagas heart disease, the proportion of patients
who died of worsening heart failure increased substantially as
increased functional class (38% vs 57%). On the other hand, the
proportion of patients who died of sudden death decreased with
the worsening of functional class (31% vs 15%). Furthermore, 23%
of deaths in NYHA class I/II were secondary to other
cardiovascular causes (Figure 5).
In non-Chagas group, sudden death was the main cause of
death throughout the spectrum of NYHA functional class; 47% in
both class I/II and class III/IV (figure 5).
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this prospective study is the first
one to investigate the causes of death in outpatients with Chagas
heart disease associated with severe systolic dysfunction in
comparison with non-Chagas patients. A recent study investigated
risk estimation for cardiac events in Chagas disease but not
analyzed the mode of death [10]. The present study found that
patients with heart failure caused by Chagas heart disease had a
worse prognosis when compared to others as well that the
predominant mode of death in these chagasic patients were
progressive heart failure throughout the spectrum of NYHA
functional class presentation. In addition, the incidence of death
related to cerebrovascular accident and non-cardiovascular deaths
was higher in Chagas disease. In the same scenario, the main
mode of death in non-Chagas group was sudden death. Moreover,
in multivariate analysis Chagas heart disease, left ventricular end
diastolic diameter, amiodarone use, serum sodium and creatinine
clearance were independent risk factors for death from progressive
heart failure.
Our finding is divergent from previous anecdotal reports
concerning mode of death in chagasic heart failure patients that
indicates sudden death as the main cause of death [4]. Prior
studies had included few patients with severe heart failure or
patients with higher values of left ventricular ejection fraction.
Furthermore data were limited to abstracts or the treatments were
outdated [4,11]. Otherwise, other publications in Chagas disease
had been selected patients with complex ventricular arrhythmias
or patients under secondary prevention for sudden death [12,13].
In the largest study in Chagas heart disease, 62.3% of the patient
died of sudden death [14]. However the patients received outdated
treatment characterized by low rate of beta-blockers (0.2%–2.4%)
and of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (1.9%–21.9%),
and unexplained high rates of amiodarone (35.1%–71.9%), that is
not in accordance with guidelines for treatment of chagasic heart
failure [15,16]. As additional limitations, it was a retrospective
study, the left ventricular function was not reported, only 10.4% of
the patients were in NYHA functional class III/IV and the mode
of death analysis was partially based on precarious Brazilian death
certificate. Our results concerning progressive heart failure death
are in concordance with other previous publications that included
chagasic patients also under outdated treatment [17,18]. Our

finding of high incidence of stroke causing death in Chagas disease
in comparison with other etiologies confirms previous studies
[18,19] despite the unexpected recently reported lack of evidence
of pro-thrombotic status among patients with Chagas disease [20].
However, cardiac embolus originating from apical aneurysm and
left ventricular thrombosis are a recurrent cause of Chagas stroke
[21]. The explanation for high incidence of non-cardiovascular
death on Chagas heart disease is unknown. However, in general
chagasic patients have lower social and nutritional status and
higher incidence of comorbidities, which could predispose them to
non-cardiovascular death [22].
Some distinguishing clinical and anatomopathological aspects
should be noted in Chagas disease that might influence the mode
of death. Biventricular impairment with persistent myocarditis,
inflammatory infiltrate edema, contraction-band necrosis and
myocytolysis, focal and diffuse areas of myocellular hypertrophy,
and fibrosis are found in histology of cardiac tissue [23–26]. Also,
chronic low-grade parasite persistence drives tissue damage and
the autoimmune component of Chagas cardiomyopathy [27].
Even though this autoimmunity may play a role in development of
Chagas heart disease, this was never demonstrated in clinical
setting. The role of anti-muscarinic antibodies in the determina￾tion of mode of death should be investigated [28]. Concerning the
effects of chagasic myocarditis in the mode of death, our findings
are in agreement with a recent study, which included 181 patients
suspected of viral myocarditis followed for 58 months and did not
show prevalence of sudden death as mode of death [29].
One would expect the influence of fibrosis in Chagas heart
disease determining sudden death as the main mode of death as in
ischemic cardiomyopathy. Although pathological findings in
Chagas disease reported a pattern of diffuse interstitial fibrosis
[30], magnetic resonance imaging study reported a pattern of
fibrosis that can vary a lot from diffuse, heterogeneous, small focal
to big transmural scars indistinguishable from myocardial infarc￾tion [31]. Ischemic cardiomyopathy displays regional fibrosis and
scars which seem to have a mechanistic link with malignant
ventricular arrhythmias [32]. The remarkable chagasic biventri￾cular impairment, especially right-sided failure has been appointed
as an independent predictor of survival in Chagas heart disease
[18]. In fact, the complex Chagas heart disease is characterized by
multiple clinical and anatomopathological factors that determine
the mode of death, the clinical manifestation and the worst
prognosis observed in our study as well as in other publications
[33,34].
The medical treatment might have influenced our results. The
38% rate of beta-blockers prescription to our chagasic patients
cannot be considered substantial but it was in accordance of
guidelines at the period of inclusion of REMADHE , when beta￾Table 3. Cox proportional hazard analysis of risk factors at baseline for heart failure mortality.

Mode of Death on Chagas Heart Disease

blockers use was controversial in chagasic patients [35]. Only
recently the use of beta-blockers was included in guidelines for the
treatment of chagasic patients [15]. However, this 38% rate is
considerably higher in comparison with previous studies where the
rate of beta-blockers were under 15% [13,14]. In addition, it could
partially explain our results given that beta-blockers reduce sudden
death in heart failure [36].
Our group has previously published that beta-blockers attenuate
the worst prognosis of Chagas heart disease, approaching similar
survival to other etiologies [33]. In this study, use of beta-blockers
was not independently associated with the risk of death from
worsening heart failure but it was independently associated with
sudden death mortality. Based on our results, it is reasonable to
suppose that beta-blockers had a more prominent effect in
preventing sudden death than worsening heart failure death in
patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy.
Specifically regarding the influence of amiodarone, which has
been widely prescribed in Chagas heart disease to prevent sudden
death and has reached up to 70% rate of use [13,37,38], our
cohort had a lower rate of its use (9.1% in total cohort and 12.7%
in Chagas group). Despite this, the percentage of sudden death was
strikingly lower in this etiology. According to I Latin American
Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of Chagas’ heart
disease, amiodarone is indicated only to (Class I) sustained
ventricular tachycardia (symptomatic or not) or symptomatic
non-sustained ventricular tachycardia and (Class IIb) for asymp￾tomatic ventricular premature beats or non-sustained ventricular
tachycardia [15].
On the other hand, amiodarone was an independent predictor
of worsening heart failure death in our cohort, which agrees with
previous study in non-chagasic population [39]. This finding could
be related to a more strict indication of amiodarone in severe
cases. However, this is an issue to be clarified in future studies
because amiodarone prescription in our heart failure clinic is
indicated according Brazilian Heart Failure Guidelines [16], in
clinical situations not necessarily related to worst prognosis in
heart failure.
In the face of our findings, an awkward question arises related to
the higher incidence of sudden death in populations of chagasic
patients despite the high rate of unexplained prescription of
amiodarone [13,40]. One issue to be clarified is the potential
influence on mortality of amiodarone side effects such as pro￾arrhythmic effects, bradycardia and AV block in a disease known
to have high incidence of AV block, sick sinus syndrome, besides
the increase deaths from circulatory failure and non-cardiovascu￾lar death [39,41].
In non-Chagas group, our proportion of sudden death and
progressive heart failure death is consistent with literature data. It

Mode of Death on Chagas Heart Disease
PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | www.plosntds.org 8 April 2013 | Volume 7 | Issue 4 | e2176

is worth noting that our prescription of beta-blockers, angiotensin￾converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker and
spironolactone reflects the state-of-the-art treatment of heart
failure. Our results corroborate the EMPHASIS trial, which
studied mild non-chagasic heart failure and demonstrated sudden
death as main mode of death among cardiovascular death [42].
Also, the CIBIS trial reported sudden death as the predominant
mode of death in the bisoprolol arm in non chagasic severe heart
failure (NYHA class III/IV) [43].
Limitations
This study contains some limitations that should be acknowl￾edged. First, this study was a single center trial that included
patients initially enrolled in another intervention trail. In addition,
this was a retrospective analysis though the data were obtained
prospectively in REMADHE trial.
Concerning our cohort, Chagas group is considerably smaller
than non-Chagas group and Kaplan-Meier curves result may have
limited value after 1500 days since the number of Chagas patients
at risk is very low. However, it is important to note that the
difference in proportion between groups reflects the reality of our
population.
In few patients, the mode of death of patients was not clarified.
However, it was less than 10%. Unfortunately, the gold standard
autopsy studies were not available widespread to confirm certainly
the cause of death. Therefore, in most randomized trials as in the
REMADHE trial the autopsy is not routinely performed.
Conclusions
Clinicians should keep in mind that in severe Chagas heart
disease progressive heart failure plays an important role as the
most important mode of death in a scenario of worse prognosis
in comparison with other etiologies. The data from this analysis
challenges the current understanding of Chagas heart disease
and may have implications in the selection of treatment choices
considering the mode of death. In addition, our results may
influence the development of new strategies for prevention of
chagasic heart failure. The amiodarone role in chagasic heart
disease should be reevaluated. Moreover, prevention of
thromboembolism must be emphatically pursued. Finally,
priority should be given to enhance the research related to
prevent and treat the progression of heart failure in Chagas
disease.
