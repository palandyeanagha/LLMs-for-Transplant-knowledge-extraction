Abstract
Vitamin K is essential for activation of c-carboxyglutamate (Gla)-proteins including the vascular calcification inhibitor matrix
Gla-protein (MGP). Insufficient vitamin K intake leads to production of uncarboxylated, mostly inactive proteins and
contributes to an increased cardiovascular risk. In kidney transplant recipients, cardiovascular risk is high but vitamin K
intake and status have not been defined. We investigated dietary vitamin K intake, vascular vitamin K status and its
determinants in kidney transplant recipients. We estimated vitamin K intake in a cohort of kidney transplant recipients
(n = 60) with stable renal function (creatinine clearance 61 [42–77] (median [interquartile range]) ml/min), who were 75 [35–
188] months after transplantation, using three-day food records and food frequency questionnaires. Vascular vitamin K
status was assessed by measuring plasma desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP). Total vitamin K intake was below
the recommended level in 50% of patients. Lower vitamin K intake was associated with less consumption of green
vegetables (33 vs 40 g/d, p = 0.06) and increased dp-ucMGP levels (621 vs 852 pmol/L, p,0.05). Accordingly, dp-ucMGP
levels were elevated (.500 pmol/L) in 80% of patients. Multivariate regression identified creatinine clearance, coumarin use,
body mass index, high sensitivity-CRP and sodium excretion as independent determinants of dp-ucMGP levels. In a
considerable part of the kidney transplant population, vitamin K intake is too low for maximal carboxylation of vascular
MGP. The high dp-ucMGP levels may result in an increased risk for arterial calcification. Whether increasing vitamin K intake
may have health benefits for kidney transplant recipients should be addressed by future studies.

Introduction
Vitamin K deficiency is increasingly recognized as a risk factor
for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in renal patients [1,2].
Vitamin K refers to a set of different fat-soluble vitamins occurring
as phylloquinone (vitamin K1) or a series of vitamins commonly
termed menaquinones (vitamin K2). The main sources of vitamin
K1, the most prominent form of vitamin K in the Western diet,
are green vegetables and dairy products. Vitamin K2 comes from
fermented food such as cheese and curd [3,4], and is mainly
considered to be produced by bacterial flora in the intestinal tract.
Both vitamers serve as cofactors for modifying glutamate into
gamma-carboxylated glutamate (Gla) residues in biological active
proteins, including matrix Gla protein (MGP) [5]. In addition,
vitamin K2 is a membrane-bound electron carrier in mitochondria
[6]. MGP, which is synthesized by vascular smooth muscle cells
and chondrocytes, is an important inhibitor of vascular calcifica￾tion [7]. Poor vitamin K status due to poor intake or the use of
vitamin K antagonists results in high uncarboxylated MGP
(ucMGP) levels and is associated with vascular calcification, both
in populations with and without renal disease [7,8]. The plasma
desphospho-ucMGP (dp-ucMGP) fraction is considered a marker
for vascular vitamin K status [9,10]. The actual contribution of
dietary vitamin K intake to the vascular vitamin K status is not yet
known, supplementation with menaquinone-7 (one of the K2
vitamins) may reduce dp-ucMGP levels in hemodialysis patients
[11].
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 October 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 10 | e47991

It has recently been demonstrated that the majority of
hemodialysis patients have vitamin K deficiency as reflected by
high dp-ucMGP levels [1], as well as low vitamin K intake [12].
Their low vitamin K intake may derive from the dietary regimen
generally prescribed to hemodialysis patients, which includes
restriction of sodium and potassium intake. Therefore dialysis
patients limit their intake of mainly green vegetables and cheeses,
i.e food products that are rich in vitamin K1 and K2, respectively.
Factors other than dietary intake such as compromised renal
function may contribute to the vitamin K status as well [13]. The
vitamin K insufficiency present in the majority of hemodialysis
patients may contribute to their strongly increased risk for arterial
calcification development [14–16].
Although cardiovascular morbidity and mortality after kidney
transplantation are lower compared to any of the dialysis
modalities, the risks are considerably higher than those in the
general population [17]. Whether vitamin K insufficiency is also
common in kidney transplant recipients is unknown, but several
factors associated with reduced vitamin K status such as impaired
renal function remain present in many patients after kidney
transplantation, and thus could affect vitamin K status. A recent
study documented that kidney transplant recipients consume less
sodium and potassium than the general population [18], but their
dietary vitamin K intake has not been documented.
The objective of this study was to determine the intake of
vitamin K1, vitamin K2 and total vitamin K and vascular vitamin
K status, by measuring desphospho-ucMGP (dp-ucMGP) levels, in
kidney transplant recipients. Furthermore, we aimed to identify
dietary factors that are associated with vitamin K status in this
patient group.
Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
The study was approved by the medical ethics committee of the
University of Groningen (METc 2008/186), and all participants
provided written informed consent. All clinical investigations have
been conducted according to the principles expressed in the
Declaration of Helsinki.
Study population
No formal power calculation was performed for this explorative
observational study. Kidney transplant recipients attending the
outpatient clinic of the University Medical Center Groningen were
recruited. Patients with a minimum age of 18 years and able to
return completed food records were eligible, irrespective of gender,
the underlying primary renal disease, the presence of cardiovas￾cular disease, diabetes mellitus, or other traditional cardiovascular
risk factors. Exclusion criteria were known malignancy, abnormal
liver function tests, history of gastrointestinal disease or metabolic
disease, or active infection. In total, 60 patients with a functioning
kidney graft for at least one year were enrolled.
Standard immunosuppressive therapy was as follows: from 1968
until 1989 prednisolone (10 mg/day) and azathioprine (100 mg/
day). From January 1989 until February 1993 ciclosporin standard
formulation (Sandimmune, Novartis; 10 mg/kg; trough levels of
175–200 mg/l in first 3 months, 150 mg/l between 3 and 12
months post-transplant and 100 mg/l thereafter) combined with
prednisolone (starting with 20 mg/day, rapidly tapered to 10 mg/
day). From March 1993 until May 1996 ciclosporin microemul￾sion (Neoral, Novartis Pharma b.v., Arnhem, The Netherlands;
10 mg/kg; trough levels idem) and prednisolone. From May 1996
to date mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (Cellcept, Roche b.v.,
Woerden, The Netherlands; 2 g/day) was added. Current
medication was extracted from the medical records.
Vitamin K intake
Dietary intake was assessed using a dietary diary that was kept
during three consecutive days in advance of the patients’ visit to
the outpatient clinic. All patients adhered to their normal dietary
habits. A trained researcher checked whether diaries were filled
out properly, and if necessary additional information was obtained
about unusual or missing reports. Intake was recorded in
household measurements and standard portion sizes. For calcu￾lations of the intakes of total energy and nutrients, we used the
Food Calculation System (BAS nutrition software 2004, Arnhem,
The Netherlands) in which Dutch food composition database
NEVO 2006 was included [19]. Concentrations of vitamin K1
and K2 (MK-4 through MK-10) of 260 foods have been added to
the NEVO (2006) food database, as described previously [15].
Dietary intake of total vitamin K, vitamin K1 and vitamin K2
from three consecutive days were averaged and used for analysis.
The U.S. Dietary Reference Intake for an adequate intake of
vitamin K for adult men is 120 micrograms/day and for adult
women 90 micrograms/day [20].
Habitual dietary intake
Additional information on dietary intake was obtained using a
semi quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) that
inquired about intake of 177 food items. For each item, the
frequency was recorded in times per day, week, or month. The
number of servings per frequency was expressed in natural units or
household measures. The questionnaire was self-administered and
filled out at home. Before participation in this study, all patients
were carefully instructed by a trained researcher on how to
complete the three day dietary diaries. In addition, similar written
instructions were provided at the first page of the diary. The FFQs
were checked for completeness and inconsistent answers were
verified with the patients. Additionally, all participants were
instructed to collect a 24 hour urine sample according to a strict
protocol. In addition, excretion of several urinary components was
measured to infer dietary intake of additional dietary nutrients like
sodium and potassium.
Vitamin K status
Blood was drawn after an 8–12 h overnight fasting period in the
morning after completion of the dietary diary. Vitamin K status
was assessed by measuring dp-ucMGP. Before serum preparation,
blood was kept for 20 min at room temperature. Plasma and
serum were prepared by standard centrifugation and stored at
280uC until testing.
Circulating dp-ucMGP levels were determined in citrated
plasma using a dual-antibody ELISA (VitaK BV Maastricht The
Netherlands). In this assay, the capture antibody is directed against
the non-phosphorylated MGP sequence 3–15 and the detection
antibody against the ucMGP sequence 35–49 or the carboxylated
MGP sequence 35–54, respectively, as described previously [2,13].
Vitamin K insufficiency was defined as dp-ucMGP levels of
.500 pmol/L [13].
Additional parameters
Renal function was assessed by calculating 24 h urinary
creatinine clearance (ml/min). Serum creatinine levels were
determined using a modified version of the Jaffe´ method (MEGA
AU 510, Merck Diagnostica, Darmstadt, Germany). Plasma and
urinary concentrations of electrolytes and urea were measured

using routine clinical laboratory methods, as were serum
cholesterol, N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT pro￾BNP), high sensitivity CRP. Information on patients’ health status,
medical history and medication use was obtained from patient
records. Questionnaires were used to obtain information on
smoking behavior. Participants were classified as current smokers,
former smokers, or never smokers. Body weight and height were
measured while participants wore indoor clothing without shoes.
Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated as weight divided by height
squared (kg/m2
).
Statistical analysis
Anthropometric, clinical and laboratory parameters were
compared between subjects with normal versus poor vitamin K
intake using the Mann-Whitney non-parametric test or chi square
test where appropriate. Similar analyses were performed to
compare the characteristics of patients with normal versus elevated
plasma dp-ucMGP levels.
Subsequently, linear regression analysis was performed to
identify independent determinants of plasma dp-ucMGP levels,
according to a gradual modeling approach. We started with a
model containing age, gender, and renal function. Subsequently,
parameters that significantly differed between subjects with normal
versus poor vitamin K status were subsequently put into the
regression model. If significant, the parameter remained in the
model; if not significant, the parameter was removed from the
model. This strategy was chosen to avoid a too large number of
degrees of freedom when all possible covariates were put into the
model at once. Non-normally distributed variables were trans￾formed to the natural log before entering into the regression
model.
Data are presented as mean6standard deviation or median
(interquartile range), depending on their distribution (normal or
non-normal, respectively), or percentages. A two-sided p-value of
,0.05 was considered statistically significant Statistical analyses
were performed using SPSS 15.0 for Windows (SPSS Corp.
Chicago, IL).
Results
The study population consisted of 30 male and 30 female kidney
transplant recipients, who were at median 75 [interquartile range
35–188] months after kidney transplantation. Creatinine clearance
was 61 ml/min [42–77 ml/min]. A detailed overview of baseline
parameters is presented in Table 1.
As shown in Table 1, total vitamin K intake was below the
recommended level in 50% of all subjects, both in men and
women. Lower vitamin K intake was associated with increased dp￾ucMGP levels reflecting vascular vitamin K insufficiency. Patients
with a low total vitamin K intake were more likely to have been on
dialysis prior to transplantation and had a trend towards longer
dialysis vintage (p = 0.05). Their diet contained more sodium, as
reflected by an increased 24h-urinary sodium excretion
(p = 0.001), and less dietary fiber (p = 0.02), with similar caloric
intake between both groups. Dietary protein intake was positively
associated with 24h-urinary urea excretion (r = 0.566, p,0.001),
and dietary potassium intake was positively associated with 24h￾potassium excretion (r = 0.468, p,0.001), suggesting that dietary
diary information was representative of the actual intake as
reflected by the 24h-urinary excretion. Analysis of the intake of
specific dietary products (Table 2) from food frequency question￾naires revealed that patients with poor vitamin K intake tended to
eat less green vegetables (p = 0.056), the most prominent dietary
source of vitamin K1, as compared to subjects with normal
vitamin K intake. Conversely, patients with poor vitamin K intake
tended to use more milk (p = 0.06). A more detailed overview of
dietary intake for both groups is provided in Table S1.
Eighty percent of kidney transplant recipients had elevated dp￾ucMGP levels, both in males (24/30) and in females (24/30).
Vitamin K status was lower in patients on calcineurin inhibitors
than in patients not using these drugs (dp-ucMGP levels 855 [590–
1350] vs 616 [472–888] pmol/L, p = 0.006). On the contrary, dp￾ucMGP levels were lower in subjects on azathioprine or cellcept
(721 [504–917] vs 1073 [870–1733] pmol/L, p = 0.008) compared
with patients not on these drugs. Separate analyses for both drugs
revealed that patients on mycophenolate mofetil had lower dp￾ucMGP levels as compared to those not on mycophenolate mofetil
(591 [479–897] vs 917 [741–1412] pmol/L, p = 0.002), but the use
of azathioprine did not influence dp-ucMGP levels (882 [703–
1088] vs 726 [491–1091] pmol/L, p = 0.14). In patients using
vitamin K antagonists (n=6), dp-ucMGP levels were higher than
in patients not on vitamin K antagonists (n = 54) with 725 pmol/L
(516–923) vs 2079 pmol/L (1.658–2.272), p,0.001). Patients with
elevated dp-ucMGP levels were more likely to have been on
dialysis (96% vs 75%, p = 0.02) and tended to have had longer
dialysis vintage (41 (17–61) vs 18 (1–30) months, p = 0.05)
compared to patients with normal dp-ucMGP levels. Furthermore,
patients with increased dp-ucMGP also had lower creatinine
clearance (60 (45–75) vs 78 (52–83) ml/min, p = 0.04), higher
levels of albuminuria (119 (62–304) vs 51 (30–75), p = 0.003, and
tended to have higher NTproBNP levels (262 (118–825) vs 147
(70–355), p = 0.054) compared to patients with normal dp￾ucMGP. All other variables (listed in Table 1) were not
significantly different between vitamin K sufficient and insufficient
patients.
Upon multivariate analysis creatinine clearance, coumarin use,
body mass index, 24h-urinary sodium excretion (borderline) and
high sensitivity CRP (borderline) were independent determinants
of the vascular vitamin K status (Table 3). NT-proBNP levels and
the type of immunosuppressive therapy were not significant
determinants of vitamin K status in the multivariate model; their
significance was lost when creatinine clearance was present in the
model.
Discussion
The current study shows for the first time that both insufficient
vitamin K intake and vascular vitamin K insufficiency (deduced
from circulating dp-ucMGP levels) are very common in a
population of stable kidney transplant recipients. Vitamin K
deficiency in kidney transplant recipients has been reported
previously by means of a coagulopathy responsive to vitamin K
treatment in case series [21]. Mazzaferro et al recently argued that
total MGP levels in kidney transplant recipients were close to
normal [22]; however their study did not differentiate between
carboxylated and uncarboxylated MGP which is important given
the role for vitamin K in MGP carboxylation. When dp-ucMGP,
an appropriate marker of vascular vitamin K status [2,3,23], was
taken into account specifically in our study, we found clear
indications of vascular vitamin K insufficiency in the majority of
kidney transplant recipients.
Dietary recommendations for an adequate intake of vitamin K
are based on the hepatic vitamin K1 requirement to for
coagulation factor synthesis [20]. It does not account for vitamin
K2 requirement to inhibit vascular calcification. The actual
necessary amount of vitamin K intake based on the role of extra￾hepatic vitamin K-dependent proteins is still unknown but studies
suggest that dietary recommendations for vitamin K are too low to

ensure full carboxylation of MGP [8]. Indeed, in our study even
the subjects with adequate vitamin K intake according to U.S.
guidelines [20] still had median dp-ucMGP levels above the
recommended level of 500 pmol/L, suggesting vascular vitamin K
insufficiency. This suggests that either kidney transplant recipients
should be recommended to increase their dietary vitamin K intake
beyond amounts recommended to the general population, or these
patients should be supplemented with extra vitamin K.
Whether for vascular vitamin K status the intake of vitamin K2
is superior to vitamin K1 is uncertain, but the intake of vitamin K2
appears to be more important than vitamin K1 to prevent
coronary heart disease [14]. Furthermore, in a recent pilot study in
hemodialysis patients, a reduction of dp-ucMGP was dose￾dependently achieved by treatment with vitamin K2 [11]. This
can be mechanistically explained by the fact that the main
transporters of vitamin K1 are triglyceride-rich lipoproteins that
are retained by the liver and serve as a cofactor for proteins
involved in coagulation. The vitamin accumulation and use in
extrahepatic tissues such as the vascular wall, is low. Vitamin K2
on the other hand is transported not only by triglyceride-rich
lipoproteins, but also by low density lipoproteins, the main carrier
system to extrahepatic tissues [24]. In our study, subjects with poor

vitamin K intake had increased dp-ucMGP levels (lower vascular
vitamin K status) compared to those with normal vitamin K
intake. On the other hand, dietary vitamin K intake (neither
vitamin K1 nor K2 or total vitamin K) was not an independent
determinant of dp-ucMGP levels upon multivariate analysis. This
suggests that either other factors such as renal function, together
with coumarin use as an iatrogenic factor, are more important
determinants of vascular vitamin K status in this population.
Dietary intake of vitamin K2 intake may also be an inappropriate
reflection of the actual amount of vitamin K2 generated by
intestinal micro-organisms. The composition of the intestinal flora,
and importantly the presence of Bacteroides species, the main
producers of vitamin K2 [25], is influenced by dietary factors
including fibers [26]. The subjects with poor vitamin K intake in
our population ate significantly less fiber than those with normal
vitamin K intake; this may have affected intestinal vitamin K2
production.
The observation that vascular vitamin K insufficiency was more
common than may be expected by vitamin K intake alone could
be explained for a considerable part by the contribution of renal
function impairment. Our data confirm the previously known
relationship between renal function [22,27] and dp-ucMGP levels
and the influence of vitamin K antagonists [11]. Whether, as in
hemodialysis patients [11], vitamin K2 supplementation may also
reduce dp-ucMGP levels in kidney transplant recipients, especially
those with compromised renal function, remains to be addressed
in prospective trials. Our finding that vascular vitamin K status
was associated with body mass index in multivariate analysis is in
line with previous studies linking vitamin K status with parameters
of glucose metabolism and atherosclerosis [28]. The borderline

significant association between dp-ucMGP levels and 24h-urine
sodium excretion suggests that high dietary sodium intake may
negative affect vitamin K metabolism. Although vitamin K
deficiency [1,2] and high sodium intake [29] have both been
associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, their possible
interactions have not been addressed.
We found a trend towards an inverse relationship between
vitamin K status and low-grade inflammation. Cell culture studies
have shown anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin K in lipopoly￾saccharide-treated fibroblasts through inhibition of interleukin-6
[30]. In animals, a vitamin K-deficient diet enhanced the
expression of inflammatory genes, which was reversed by vitamin
K1-supplemented diets; furthermore the supplemented diet
suppressed the inflammatory response induced by lipopolysaccha￾ride [31]. Recently, both plasma vitamin K status and intake were
inversely related to inflammatory markers in a human general
population cohort [32].
The reduced vascular vitamin K status in patients on
calcineurin inhibitors is in line with the increased risk of
cardiovascular complications in patients on these drugs, particu￾larly ciclosporin [33]. On the other hand, in our multivariate
analysis of determinants of vitamin K status, none of the
immunosuppressive drugs remained in the model after co￾adjustment for creatinine clearance, suggesting that the differences
in vitamin K status can be explained by differences in creatinine
clearance. A recent report suggested that MGP levels were higher
in patients on mTOR inhibitors [34]; unfortunately our cohort
contained only two patients using this class of drugs.
Our study has the limitation of being a relatively small single
center study in Caucasian patients only, so the generalizability of
our findings will require support by studies in other populations.
The limited sample size may have influenced the results of
multivariate regression analysis, e.g. regarding the role of
immunosuppressive regimens as determinants of vitamin K status.
Furthermore, although dp-ucMGP levels have been associated
with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the chronic kidney
disease population [1,2], these associations have not yet been
established for the kidney transplant population.
In conclusion, we found that elevated dp-ucMGP levels,
reflecting vascular vitamin K insufficiency, is common in kidney
transplant recipients. Poor vitamin K intake is common in renal
transplant recipients, and our data suggest that other factors
including renal function may contribute to poor vascular vitamin
K status as well. Correction of vitamin K status might be clinically
relevant, given the known associations of vascular vitamin K
deficiency with cardiovascular outcomes. Whether this can be
achieved by relatively simple dietary measures in kidney transplant
recipients should be addressed in future prospective studies.
