Oxygen, oxidative stress, hypoxia, 
and heart failure

A constant supply of oxygen is indispensable for cardiac viability and function. However, the role of oxygen and 
oxygen-associated processes in the heart is complex, and they and can be either beneficial or contribute to cardiac 
dysfunction and death. As oxygen is a major determinant of cardiac gene expression, and a critical participant in 
the formation of ROS and numerous other cellular processes, consideration of its role in the heart is essential in 
understanding the pathogenesis of cardiac dysfunction.
The mammalian heart is an obligate aerobic organ. At a rest￾ing pulse rate, the heart consumes approximately 8–15 ml 
O2/min/100 g tissue. This is significantly more than that con￾sumed by the brain (approximately 3 ml O2/min/100 g tissue) 
and can increase to more than 70 ml O2/min/100 g myocardial 
tissue during vigorous exercise (1, 2). Mammalian heart muscle 
cannot produce enough energy under anaerobic conditions to 
maintain essential cellular processes; thus, a constant supply of 
oxygen is indispensable to sustain cardiac function and viability. 
The story of oxygen in the heart is complex, however, and goes 
well beyond its role in energy metabolism.
Oxygen is a major determinant of myocardial gene expression, 
and as myocardial O2 levels decrease, either during isolated hypox￾ia or ischemia-associated hypoxia, gene expression patterns in the 
heart are significantly altered (3). Oxygen participates in the gen￾eration of NO, which plays a critical role in determining vascular 
tone, cardiac contractility, and a variety of additional parameters. 
Oxygen is also central in the generation of reactive oxygen spe￾cies (ROS), which can participate as benevolent molecules in cell 
signaling processes or can induce irreversible cellular damage and 
death. Oxygen is thus both vital and deleterious (4).
The role of oxygen in myocardial energetics 
and metabolism
The heart can utilize a variety of metabolic fuels, including fatty 
acids, glucose, lactate, ketones, and amino acids. In the fed state, 
fatty acids are the preferred fuel, accounting for up to 90% of the 
total acetyl-CoA provided to cardiac mitochondria (5). Fatty acids 
are metabolized by β-oxidation, producing acetyl-CoA, NADH, and 
FADH2. The acetyl-CoA enters the Krebs cycle, producing more 
NADH and FADH2. Glucose is metabolized initially via the gly￾colytic pathway, producing a relatively small amount of ATP and 
also pyruvate, which enters the Krebs cycle, producing NADH and 
FADH2. In the absence of oxygen, the total amount of energy pro￾duced by these processes is insufficient to meet cardiac needs. The 
cardiac energy requirement is met, however, by entry of the resultant 
NADH and FADH2 into the electron transport chain, which gener￾ates ATP by oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria. Oxygen 
serves as the terminal electron acceptor in the electron transport 
chain, and in the absence of sufficient oxygen, electron transport 
ceases and cardiac energy demands are not met (Figure 1).
Generation and counterbalancing of ROS
ROS can be formed in the heart by a variety of mechanisms, includ￾ing generation during oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochon￾dria as a byproduct of normal cellular aerobic metabolism (4, 6). 
Thus, the major process from which the heart derives sufficient 
energy can also result in the production of ROS (6). Each oxygen 
atom contains 2 unpaired electrons in its outermost shell. Atoms 
or molecules with unpaired electrons are designated free radicals 
and are highly reactive entities that can readily participate in a 
variety of chemical/biochemical reactions. Molecular oxygen, O2, 
is characterized as diradical, a property that allows liquid oxygen 
to be attracted to the poles of a magnet. This property also dictates 
that full reduction of oxygen to water as a terminal event in the 
electron transport chain requires 4 electrons. The sequential dona￾tion of electrons to oxygen during this process can generate ROS 
as intermediates, and “electron leakage” can also contribute to the 
formation of ROS (4, 7, 8). Donation of a single electron to molecu￾lar oxygen results in the formation of the superoxide radical (O2•
–). 
Donation of a second electron yields peroxide, which then under￾goes protonation to yield hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Donation of 
a third electron, such as occurs in the Fenton reaction (Fe2+ + H2O2
→ Fe3+ + •OH + OH–), results in production of the highly reactive 
hydroxyl radical (•OH). Finally, donation of a fourth electron yields 
water. Singlet oxygen (1O2), a very short-lived and reactive form of 
molecular oxygen in which the outer electrons are raised to a higher 
energy state, can be formed by a variety of mechanisms, including 
the Haber-Weiss reaction (H2O2 + O2•
– → •OH + OH– + 1O2) (9).
ROS can be formed in the heart, and other tissues, by several 
mechanisms; they can be produced by xanthine oxidase (XO), 
NAD(P)H oxidases, cytochrome P450; by autooxidation of 
catecholamines; and by uncoupling of NO synthase (NOS) (10–14). 
NO contains an unpaired electron, and under certain conditions 
can react with O2•
– to form peroxynitrite (ONOO•
–), a powerful oxi￾dant. ROS formation in the heart can be induced by the action of 
cytokines and growth factors as well. Angiotensin II (ATII), PDGF, 
and TNF-α, for example, can induce H2O2 and O2•– formation 
via activation of the NAD(P)H oxidases (10, 15). This NAD(P)H￾dependent pathway is best described in vascular smooth muscle 
cells but has also been documented in other cell types, including

cardiomyocytes (16–20). A number of additional ligands have been 
associated with the induction of ROS, including several with par￾ticular relevance to the cardiovascular system (reviewed by Than￾nickal et al. in ref. 15).
There are several cellular mechanisms that counterbalance the 
production of ROS, including enzymatic and nonenzymatic path￾ways (21). Among the best-characterized enzymatic pathways are 
catalase and glutathione peroxidase, which coordinate the cataly￾sis of H2O2 to water, and the superoxide dismutases (SODs), which 
facilitate the formation of H2O2 from O2•
– (22–25). Thioredoxin 
and thioredoxin reductase together form an additional enzymatic 
antioxidant and redox regulatory system 
that has been implicated in a wide variety 
of ROS-related processes (21). Thioredoxin 
and thioredoxin reductase can catalyze the 
regeneration of many antioxidant molecules, 
including ubiquinone (Q10), lipoic acid, 
and ascorbic acid, and as such constitute an 
important antioxidant defense against ROS. 
Deletion of thioredoxin reductase results in 
developmental heart abnormalities and in 
cardiac death secondary to a severe dilated 
cardiomyopathy (26).
Nonenzymatic mechanisms include 
intracellular antioxidants such as the vita￾mins E, C, and β-carotene (a precursor to 
vitamin A), ubiquinone, lipoic acid, and urate 
(21). They also include glutathione, which 
acts as a reducing substrate for the enzymatic 
activity of glutathione peroxidase.
The biological significance of ROS
ROS have an important role in several 
important biological processes, including 
the oxidative burst reaction essential to phagocytes (27). They 
are involved in a variety of cellular signaling pathways (28), act￾ing in some instances as second messengers downstream of spe￾cific ligands, including TGF-β1, PDGF, ATII, FGF-2, endothelin, 
and others (14, 15, 29, 30). ROS are also involved in modulat￾ing the activity of specific transcription factors, including NF-κB 
and activator protein–1 (AP-1) (20, 31–34). NF-κB, for example, 
becomes more transcriptionally active in response to the contri￾bution of ROS to the degradation of IκB, the inhibitory partner 
of NF-κB that sequesters it in the cytosol. Thus ROS can play an 
important role in modulating inflammation.

and outer mitochondrial membranes. This pro￾ton gradient provides the energy for ATP pro￾duction via complex 5. Sustaining this crucial

Perhaps the most widely recognized biological effects of ROS, 
however, are those that occur when cellular antioxidant defenses 
are overwhelmed and ROS react directly with cellular lipids, pro￾teins, and DNA, causing cell damage and death (4, 27, 35, 36). 
Lipid peroxidation, for example, is a well-characterized effect of 
ROS that results in damage to the cell membrane as well as to 
the membranes of cellular organelles (37, 38). ROS can contrib￾ute to mutagenesis of DNA by inducing strand breaks, purine 
oxidation, and protein-DNA cross-linking, and other ROS￾mediated alterations in chromatin structure may significantly 
affect gene expression (39, 40). Modification of proteins by ROS 
can cause inactivation of critical enzymes and can induce dena￾turation that renders proteins nonfunctional (41, 42). General 
aging and age-related alteration in the cardiovascular system 
have been attributed to the long-term cumulative effects of ROS, 
although the relative contribution of ROS to the aging process 
remains the subject of debate (43, 44). Figure 2 depicts several 
pathways by which ROS can mediate biological effects germane 
to the cardiovascular system.
Actions of ROS relevant to the heart, and the potential 
role of ROS in heart failure
A significant number of in vitro and animal studies have 
demonstrated ROS activation in the cardiovascular system in 
response to various stressors and in the failing heart (6, 14, 20, 
36, 45–47). Further, although the results are somewhat incon￾sistent, animal studies have also delineated that antioxidants 
and ROS defense pathways can ameliorate ROS-mediated car￾diac abnormalities (26, 48–50).
Many ROS-mediated biological processes that are germane to 
the heart and to the genesis of heart failure have been described.
ROS in ischemic syndromes
Given that coronary artery disease (CAD) with consequent myocar￾dial ischemia and necrosis is a leading cause of heart failure world￾wide, it is important to note that ROS may play an important role 
in the genesis and progression of CAD (51, 52). ROS activity in 
the vessel wall, for example, is thought to contribute to the forma￾tion of oxidized LDL, a major contributor to the pathogenesis of 
atherosclerosis (53). ROS-associated activation of MMPs may play 
an important role in vessel plaque rupture, initiating coronary 
thrombosis and occlusion (54).
In the setting of acute myocardial infarction (MI), ROS are pur￾ported to play a significant role in tissue necrosis and reperfu￾sion injury (55, 56). Transgenic overexpression of SOD has been 
shown to reduce infarct size in mice, which supports the conten￾tion that ROS are important mediators of myocardial damage 
in MI (50). However, attempts to target SOD to improve out￾come after MI in other animal models have yielded mixed results, 
suggesting that ROS activation is only a single contributor to 
post-MI necrosis and reperfusion injury and/or that SOD alone 
is insufficient to neutralize the deleterious effects of ROS in 
this setting. ROS also play a significant role in the pathogenesis 
of myocardial stunning, which can complicate acute ischemic 
syndromes (57). XO expression is significantly increased in the 
setting of MI, which increases the probability that XO-induced 
ROS will be generated. Interestingly, administration of the XO 
inhibitor allopurinol in the setting of acute MI attenuates stun￾ning and ameliorates the excitation-contraction uncoupling that 
occurs in stunned myocardium (58, 59).
At least 20% of patients who suffer MI go on to develop heart 
failure. The manner in which the ventricle heals and remodels 
after MI is a major determinant of eventual cardiac function and 
the progression to heart failure (60). ROS may contribute to the 
remodeling processes in a number of ways, including activating 
MMPs that participate in reconfiguration of the extracellular 
matrix; acting as signaling molecules in the development of com￾pensatory hypertrophy; and contributing to myocyte loss via apop￾tosis or other cell death mechanisms (20, 61, 62). Recently it was 
shown that inhibition of XO with allopurinol after experimental 
MI in dogs diminished ROS production in the myocardium and 
attenuated maladaptive LV remodeling, leading to improved post￾MI cardiac function (63). While this does not prove that ROS are a 
major clinical target for decreasing the progression to failure after 
MI, these findings are part of a growing list of data suggesting a 
major contribution of ROS to this process.

Mechanisms by which ROS can alter the 
structure and function of cardiac muscle. ATII 
binds a G-protein–associated receptor, initiat￾ing a cascade of events that involves activa￾tion of O2
•– production by the NAD(P)H oxidase 
NOX2. O2
•– is converted by SOD into H2O2 and •
OH that mediates activation of MAPKs via a 
tyrosine kinase. MAPK activation can lead to 
cardiac hypertrophy or to apoptosis. The ROS 
that is generated can also signal through ASK￾1 to induce cardiac hypertrophy, apoptosis, or 
phosphorylate troponin T, an event that reduces 
myofilament sensitivity and cardiac contractility. 
NO production by the NO synthases iNOS and 
eNOS can interact with O2
•– to form ONOO•–. 
ONOO•– can cause lipid peroxidation, an event 
that can alter ion channel and ion pump func￾tion. Catalase and glutathione reductase (GPx) 
are shown as enzymatic pathways to produce 
water and oxygen from H2O2.

ROS in cardiac hypertrophy, apoptosis, 
and the transition to failure
Cardiac hypertrophy can be either compensatory and adaptive or 
a maladaptive precursor to cardiac failure. Mounting evidence has 
strongly implicated ROS signaling in the genesis of cardiac hyper￾trophy (64–68). Many extracellular factors are capable of inducing 
hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes, and many of the various down￾stream signaling pathways that mediate the hypertrophic growth 
response to these factors can be activated directly or indirectly by 
ROS. These include PKC; the MAPKs p38, JNK, apoptosis-sig￾naling kinase 1 (ASK-1), and ERK1/2; PI3K; Akt; several tyrosine 
kinases (e.g., src and FAK); NF-κB; and calcineurin (20, 69). An 
example of purported direct activation is ROS-mediated activa￾tion of PKC via oxidation of cysteine residues (70). An example 
in which an extracellular signal induces cardiac hypertrophy via a 
ROS-dependent pathway is ATII-induced hypertrophy. The clini￾cal role of ATII in the development and progression of heart fail￾ure is now well established, and blocking either ATII generation or 
ATII binding to the AT1 receptor prolongs life in specific patient 
cohorts. ATII induces cardiac hypertrophy via a G-protein–linked 
pathway that involves generation of ROS and ROS-associated acti￾vation of several downstream signals, including MAPKs (71). Inter￾estingly, inhibition of ROS by antioxidants blocks ATII-mediated 
cardiac hypertrophy (71, 72).
As mentioned above, it has been shown that ATII induces ROS 
in large measure via NAD(P)H oxidases, although the mechanism 
by which ATII activates these oxidases has remained incomplete￾ly understood. In vitro and in vivo data suggest that the small 
G-protein Rho may be involved in this link. Inhibition of Rho 
with a dominant-negative construct in neonatal rat cardiomyo￾cytes prevents ATII-mediated intracellular oxidation events, and 
inhibition of Rho activation by the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor 
simvastatin blocked ATII-mediated increases in protein synthe￾sis in these cells, leading to smaller cell sizes (20, 73, 74). Simva￾statin administration in vivo also prevented cardiac hypertrophy 
in response to either ATII administration or pressure overload 
induced by aortic banding, which establishes that the effects of 
ROS on hypertrophy are not an artifactual in vitro finding (74).
Another mechanism by which ROS can induce cardiac hyper￾trophy is via transcription factor–mediated alterations in gene 
expression. For example, ATII stimulates ROS-mediated activa￾tion of the transcription factor NF-κB, which is purported to play 
an important role in the induction of cardiac hypertrophy. AP-1 
activity is also purportedly regulated by ROS and is involved in 
the transcriptional expression of several genes involved in cardiac 
hypertrophy. In addition, it is possible that regulation of transcrip￾tion by ROS may be far more widespread than anticipated and that 
ROS-mediated alterations in gene structure and function contrib￾ute significantly to the pathogenesis of disease in many organ sys￾tems, including the heart. Recently the roles of ROS in chromatin 
remodeling and in DNA damage have become more established, 
and consideration of the potential involvement of these effects in 
the failing heart is warranted.
Another MAPK family member linking ROS and hypertrophy 
is the redox-sensitive kinase ASK-1. ASK-1 is strongly activated by 
ROS and in turn activates MAPKs p38 and JNK. Deletion of ASK-1 
attenuates p38 and JNK activation and the cardiac hypertrophic 
response to ATII (75). Expression of a dominant-negative ASK-1 
attenuates NF-κB activation and inhibits cardiac hypertrophy in 
response to ROS-generating G-protein receptor agonists, which 
demonstrates a role for ASK-1 in the link among ROS, NF-κB, and 
cardiac hypertrophy (31). ASK-1 also mediates TNF-α–induced 
apoptosis, which constitutes another link between ROS and an 
event (apoptosis) that contributes to the pathogenesis of heart dis￾ease (76). Overexpression of ASK-1 induces apoptosis in cardiomy￾ocytes, and ASK-1–null mice demonstrate attenuated ventricular 
remodeling in response to pressure overload, a finding attributed 
in part to a reduction in cardiac apoptosis (77).
Cardiomyocyte apoptosis occurs in hypertrophied, ischemic, 
and failing hearts and may contribute to the development and 
progression of cardiac dysfunction and heart failure (47, 78). 
Experimental evidence suggests that ROS can mediate apoptosis 
by a variety of mechanisms, including direct mediation of geno￾toxicity (62, 68, 79). Interestingly, whether or not apoptosis is 
induced in cardiomyocytes by oxidative stress appears to be depen￾dent upon the level of ROS produced (64). For instance, in adult 
cardiomyocytes, relatively low levels of H2O2 are associated with 
the activation of ERK1/2 MAPK and the stimulation of protein 
synthesis. Conversely, a higher level of H2O2, while still activat￾ing ERK1/2, also activates the JNK and p38 MAPKs and Akt and 
induces apoptosis (64). Another clinically relevant potential link 
between heart failure and ROS involves adrenergic signaling (14, 
80). That β-adrenergic receptor (βAR) blockers prolong life and are 
beneficial in heart failure is well established. One mechanism may 
be the prevention of βAR-induced apoptosis, an event that appears 
to involve ROS activation (80).
ROS effects on ion channels and calcium flux
Ion flux is critical to normal cardiac function, and there is signifi￾cant evidence that ROS alter ion channel flux and membrane ion 
pump function in a biologically important manner in heart muscle 
(81). General membrane damage secondary to ROS-mediated lipid 
peroxidation is one mechanism by which this can occur; however, 
more specific ROS-mediated effects also contribute. ROS can target 
L-type calcium channels on the sarcolemma and suppress the Ca2+
current (82). ROS depress the activity of the sarcoplasmic reticu￾lum Ca2+ ATPase SERCA2, a membrane calcium pump that has 
been shown to play a crucial role in cardiac calcium handling and as 
a determinant of myocardial contractility (83). SERCA2 expression 
is concomitantly reduced in cardiomyocytes stimulated to hyper￾trophy via ROS-associated signaling pathways. ROS generation can 
also alter the function of cardiac sodium channels, potassium chan￾nels, and ion exchangers, such as the Na/Ca exchanger (84, 85).
In another ROS-mediated pathway that may lead to reduced con￾tractility, ROS can decrease the calcium sensitivity of the myofila￾ments. Recently it was shown that the ROS-related kinase ASK-1 
associates with and phosphorylates troponin T in vitro and in vivo 
and that this event diminishes contractility and alters calcium 
handling in cardiomyocytes (86). Whether this pathway contrib￾utes to human heart failure remains unknown. It has been postu￾lated, however, that via mechanisms such as this ROS-mediated 
abnormality in excitation-contraction coupling, chronic exposure 
to ROS contributes to the progression of failure.
Lipotoxicity and ROS
Myocardial lipotoxicity refers to the accumulation of intramyocar￾dial lipids concomitant with contractile dysfunction, often associ￾ated with myocyte death (87, 88). Recently it was shown that lipid 
accumulation is a significant feature of clinical heart failure (88). 
Lipid accumulation occurs when there is an imbalance between 

review series
504 The Journal of Clinical Investigation http://www.jci.org Volume 115 Number 3 March 2005
lipid uptake and β-oxidation, a circumstance that can occur via 
a variety of mechanisms. Lipid accumulation induces an increase 
in the PPARα, a nuclear receptor that alters gene expression in 
response to lipids. PPARα increases fatty acid oxidation, and 
increased expression of PPARα has been associated with the devel￾opment of cardiac dysfunction, including diabetic cardiomyopa￾thy (89). Although the mechanism by which this occurs remains 
unclear, β-oxidation of fatty acids generates ROS, and data sug￾gests that ROS play a role in the pathogenesis of PPARα-associated 
cardiomyopathies and lipotoxicity (88).
Reactive nitrogen species, NO, and cardiac function
NO, by virtue of its unpaired outer shell electron, is a reactive mol￾ecule. In addition to the expansive array of crucially important bio￾logical processes in which it plays a role, NO is also a determinant 
of cardiac contractility. Initially NO was characterized as a con￾tractility depressant, although the role of NO, and the NO-gener￾ating NO synthases, is now understood to be much more complex 
with regard to effects on cardiac contractility (90, 91). Although its 
general biology will not be reviewed here, NO does react and inter￾act with ROS, and this crosstalk can also have significant effects 
on cardiac function (92).
NO can mediate the S-nitrosylation of proteins at specific 
cysteine residues (93). This process also occurs in the heart and 
has significant functional implications, especially with regard 
to calcium flux and excitation-contraction coupling (94, 95). 
S-nitrosylation is facilitated by O2•– when O2•– is present at “physi￾ologic” levels. When levels of O2•– increase, however, it becomes 
inhibitory to normal S-nitrosylation. Increased O2•– levels also 
facilitate interaction of O2•– with NO to form deleterious reac￾tive molecules, including peroxynitrite (96). Thus, at an optimal 
NO/O2•– stoichiometry, the crosstalk between these 2 reactive spe￾cies facilitates essential cellular processes, a relationship termed 
nitroso-redox balance in a recent editorial addressing the results 
of the African American Heart Failure Trial (95). In that trial, 
combined therapy with hydralazine, a vasodilator that inhibits 
generation of O2•–, and isosorbide dinitrate improved quality-of￾life scores and decreased mortality by approximately 45% in Afri￾can Americans with severe heart failure (97). A compelling argu￾ment has been made that the effectiveness of this therapy is due 
in part to restoration of nitroso-redox balance.
Do ROS play a role in clinical heart failure?
Several clinical observations support the hypothesis that ROS 
play a role in human heart failure, although to date the clinical 
data has been conflicting and less than compelling (98, 99). In a 
handful of defined cardiomyopathies, the contribution of ROS is 
well established, including alcohol-mediated and anthrocycline￾induced cardiomyopathies (100). In other forms of human heart 
failure, the role of ROS has not been definitively established. One 
problem is that it has been difficult to determine ROS activity in 
vivo, and clinical studies have relied on indirect measures, using 
biochemical markers of ROS activity, including indices of lipid 
peroxidation. Further, the patients included in these studies often 
had confounding comorbidities that could induce alterations in 
these biochemical markers, independent of cardiac-specific ROS 
activity (99). Finally, the presence of ROS in the heart concomitant 
with heart failure does not prove a causal relationship, and clini￾cal trials using antioxidant therapy have yielded mixed and often 
disappointing results. This may, however, reflect the difficulty in 
altering ROS-associated processes in vivo rather than an absence 
of their involvement in human cardiac failure or may indicate that 
the relationship between ROS and heart failure is too complex to 
be addressable by a single intervention (101). Representative exam￾ples of the conflicting clinical data follow.
In failing human hearts of patients with either ischemic or 
dilated cardiomyopathy, NAD(P)H oxidase–linked ROS activity 
was elevated and associated with increased rac-1 GTPase activity 
(98). Treatment of heart failure patients with statins decreased 
rac-1 activity in myocardium from these patients, possibly via 
statin effects on ROS activity. Treatment with the XO inhibitor 
allopurinol improved cardiac contractility and restored normal 
vasomotor reactivity (102, 103). Treatment with vitamin C inhib￾ited endothelial cell apoptosis (104). Carvedilol has been shown in 
clinical trials to be superior to other β-blockers for the treatment 
of congestive heart failure, and one potential mechanism that has 
been put forth to explain this is that carvedilol has antioxidant 
effects (105). Conversely, large clinical trials of the antioxidant 
vitamins or precursors have not shown benefit in preventing car￾diac morbidity or mortality (106–108). A larger clinical trial of a 
XO inhibitor to follow up on the earlier positive clinical results is 
planned, but at this time, the jury remains out regarding the thera￾peutic utility of antioxidant therapy for heart failure (109).
Oxygen as a determinant of myocardial gene expression 
and cardiac function
Myocardial oxygen consumption and availability must be matched 
to ensure normal cardiac function and viability. Although physio￾logical mechanisms are in place to coordinate this balance dynami￾cally in response to acute and subacute alterations in cardiac work￾load, alterations in gene expression patterns also play a critical 
role, generally as adaptive responses to cardiac stressors that alter 
either myocardial O2 consumption (e.g., pressure overload) or O2
delivery (e.g., coronary artery disease). Gene expression is adjusted 
to oxygen availability in the heart by several mechanisms, includ￾ing regulation of gene transcription by the hypoxia-inducible basic 
helix-loop-helix transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1α
(HIF-1α) (3, 110). HIF-1α regulates the transcription of an exten￾sive repertoire of genes, including many involved in angiogenesis 
and vascular remodeling, erythropoiesis, metabolism, apopto￾sis, control of ROS, vasomotor reactivity and vascular tone, and 
inflammation (111–113).
HIF-1α alters the transcription of these genes by dimerizing with 
the aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocase (ARNT, or HIF-1β) and 
then binding to specific hypoxia response elements (HREs) in their 
regulatory regions. The general response to HIF is transcriptional 
activation, coordinated by recruitment of the p300 coactivator. 
ARNT is generally abundant; thus the availability of HIF-1α is rate 
limiting in formation of the HIF-ARNT dimer. The major mecha￾nism coordinating the effects of HIF-1α on gene expression with 
oxygen availability involves the posttranslational regulation of 
HIF-1α abundance. HIF-1α is constitutively transcribed and trans￾lated in the heart and most other tissues, but under conditions 
in which oxygen is abundant, HIF undergoes prolyl-hydroxylation 
at the direction of specific cellular prolyl hydroxylases (114). This 
hydroxylation event produces a binding site recognized by the von 
Hippel–Lindau protein (VHL) (115). VHL, which is deficient in 
the von Hippel–Lindau syndrome, is a subunit in an E3 ubiquitin 
ligase complex that polyubiquitylates HIF-1α, thus targeting it for 
rapid destruction by the proteosome. When oxygen is less abun-

review series

dant, prolyl-hydroxylation does not occur, and consequently VHL 
does not bind to and ubiquitylate HIF-1α. HIF-1α thus accumu￾lates in the cell, associates with ARNT, binds the HRE in hypoxia￾responsive genes, and alters the transcription of those genes. This 
post-translational level of control assures that HIF-mediated tran￾scriptional responses to hypoxia occur rapidly. Control of HIF-1α
expression at the mRNA level does occur but is much less impor￾tant than this post-translational mechanism.
Cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of HIF-1α leads to altered 
expression of multiple genes in the normoxic heart, which estab￾lishes that HIF-1α plays an important role in coordinating gene 
expression with oxygen availability within the normal range of oxy￾gen tensions encountered in the heart, independent of hypoxia or 
ischemia. This is borne out by the finding that expression of HIF-1α
in cardiomyocytes is required to maintain normal myocardial 
metabolism, vascularity, calcium handling, and contractile func￾tion under normoxic conditions (3). Interestingly, it was recently 
shown that HIF-1α levels are also coordinated by a Fenton reaction 
in the endoplasmic reticulum, which provides an important link 
between ROS and oxygen-sensitive gene expression (116). Con￾versely, HIF-1α coordinates the expression of several genes that 
could have a significant impact on ROS and nitroso-redox balance 
(117, 118). For example, HIF regulates the expression of iNOS and, 
indirectly (via VEGF), the levels and activity of eNOS and thus has 
an effect on NO availability. HIF also has marked effects on the 
expression of genes involved in cardiac metabolism, including all 
of the glycolytic enzymes, a critical glucose transporter, and lactate 
dehydrogenase (3). These alterations in cardiac metabolism could 
have a significant impact on ROS generation. Evidence that hypox￾ia-inducible gene expression may play a role in control of oxidative 
stress includes the demonstration in a recent publication that dele￾tion of HIF-2α (EPAS-1, an HIF family member that also dimerizes 
with ARNT) causes multiple organ pathology, including severe car￾diomyopathy, associated with loss of ROS homeostasis (46). Figure 
3 summarizes the mechanisms by which HIF levels are regulated by 
oxygen and the manner in which ROS and HIF may interact.
Hypoxia-inducible gene expression via HIF-1α is beneficially 
adaptive in the context of acute or subacute myocardial hypoxia 
or ischemia (119). Examples of HIF-mediated adaptations include 
increased expression of VEGF to promote angiogenesis; glucose 
transporter 1 to enhance glucose uptake; the glycolysis-associated 
enzymes to facilitate glucose metabolism; and erythropoietin to 
enhance hematopoiesis and increase oxygen carrying capacity. It 
remains an open question, however, whether chronic activation of 
HIF-1α, or other hypoxia-responsive pathways, is maladaptive.
Chronic ischemia can lead to progressive heart failure, inde￾pendent of the acute loss of heart muscle by necrosis. Whether 
progressive loss of function in the setting of chronic ischemia is 
due to incremental loss of myocytes and decreased contractility 
resulting from an inadequate adaptive response to ischemia or is 
due to maladaptive effects of chronically activated hypoxia-isch￾emia response pathways in the heart, or both, remains unclear. 
HIF-1α levels have been shown to be elevated in the myocardium 
of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (120), and it is conceiv￾able that chronic transcriptional activation of HIF-1α–respon￾sive genes is deleterious. In addition to HIF-1α, there are at least 
2 additional HIF subunits, HIF-2α (EPAS-1) and HIF-3α, that 
are regulated in a manner similar to HIF-1α and that can part￾ner with ARNT. The relative roles of HIF-1α and HIF-2α remain 
unclear, and the coordination of their activities appears to be 
complex (121). As mentioned above, HIF-2α–null mice mani￾fest a severe cardiomyopathy that appears to be related to ROS 
activation (46). Whether this phenotype is exclusively due to the 
loss of HIF-2α–mediated effects on gene expression or involves 
in some reciprocal manner alterations in HIF-1α–mediated activ￾ity is not clear from the literature. Interestingly, we have recently 
found that cardiac-specific deletion of VHL, an intervention that 
causes an increase in HIF-1α levels, causes severe dilated cardio￾myopathy with pathologic changes consistent with those seen 
in ischemic cardiomyopathy (122). Whether this is due entirely 
to elevated HIF-1α levels in the absence of VHL or to loss of an 
HIF-independent role of VHL remains unclear, but the data from 
Figure 3
Transcriptional gene regulation by the hypoxia￾inducible factor HIF-1α. HIF-1α protein under￾goes rapid prolyl hydroxylation under normoxic 
conditions by specific cellular prolyl hydroxylas￾es. Direct hydroxylation by ROS is a purported 
alternative pathway. Hydroxylated HIF interacts 
with the VHL, a critical member of an E3 ubiquitin 
ligase complex that polyubiquitylates HIF (Ub, 
ubiquitin). Polyubiquitylation targets HIF-1α for 
destruction by the proteosome. Under hypoxia 
(↓O2) hydroxylation does not occur and HIF￾1α is stabilized. Heterodimerization with ARNT 
forms the active HIF complex that binds to a 
core hypoxia response element in a wide array 
of genes involved in a diversity of biological pro￾cesses germane to cardiovascular function. Tran￾scriptional activation of iNOS expression is shown 
as an example of how HIF-mediated gene expres￾sion can affect ROS generation by generating NO 
that interacts with O2
•– to form ONOO•–. NOX2 is 
shown as a cellular source of O2

these studies strongly supports a critical role of the HIF pathway 
in regulating cardiac function.
Is there relationship between ventricular geometry, 
oxygen, ROS, and cardiac function?
Ventricular geometry is a major determinant of cardiac function 
and is also a critical determinant of myocardial oxygen consump￾tion. Myocardial oxygen consumption is proportional to ventric￾ular wall tension, and by Laplace’s law, ventricular wall tension 
is proportional to P × r / 2π (where P is pressure, r is the radius 
of curvature of the ventricle, and π is ventricular wall thickness). 
Thus, at any given pressure and myocardial thickness, a larger ven￾tricle will consume more oxygen per gram tissue than a smaller 
one. Therefore, irrespective of the etiology, a failing dilated heart 
requires more oxygen per gram tissue than a nonfailing smaller 
heart. The consequences of this remain unclear, especially in the 
setting of heart failure unrelated to coronary disease, but it is 
reasonable to postulate that this alteration in myocardial oxygen 
consumption leads to alterations in gene expression and possibly 
in ROS generation. Ventricular volume reduction by aneurysmec￾tomy or partial left ventriculectomy can lead to improved cardiac 
function, although in the latter case there is no clear correlation 
with increased survival (123). The role of decreased wall stress, 
decreased myocardial oxygen consumption, and consequent alter￾ations in the expression of hypoxia-responsive genes in the clinical 
response to these procedures is unclear but of significant inter￾est. The Acorn device, a mesh that is wrapped around the heart 
to limit ventricular dilation, is under clinical investigation for the 
treatment of heart failure. Interestingly, it is postulated that one 
potential benefit of this approach will be to decrease ROS genera￾tion associated with cardiac dilation (124).
One additional, as-yet-unproven therapeutic approach to heart 
failure is the induction of angiogenesis with growth factors such 
as VEGF, even in the absence of coronary artery disease. This 
approach is based on the hypothesis that myocardial hypoxia 
occurs as a consequence of mismatch in the relationship between 
myocardial mass, myocardial oxygen demand, myocardial vascu￾larity, and oxygen delivery and that this mismatch contributes to 
the genesis of heart failure. This can theoretically occur in a variety 
of settings, including in nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy as 
a consequence of the Laplace relationship as describe above or in 
pathologic cardiac hypertrophy in which myocardial vascularity 
might not be sufficient for the increased myocardial muscle mass. 
Supporting this hypothesis is our finding that cardiomyocyte-spe￾cific deletion of VEGF in the mouse heart leads to hypovascularity 
and dilated cardiomyopathy, although this phenotype may also 
reflect defects in normal development of the myocardium in the 
absence of VEGF (125).
Conclusions
Oxygen, beyond its indispensable role in cardiac energy metabo￾lism, plays a central role in other biological processes that can be 
determinants of cardiac function, including the generation of 
ROS and the determination of cardiac gene expression patterns. 
Although their role in the pathogenesis of clinical heart failure 
remains unclear, ROS have been implicated in most processes 
thought to have a significant effect on cardiac function, includ￾ing hypertrophy, ion flux and calcium handling, EC coupling, 
extracellular matrix configuration, vasomotor function, metabo￾lism, gene expression, and downstream signaling of several growth 
factors and cytokines. Clinical trials based on antioxidant thera￾pies have been, however, generally disappointing. Whether this 
is a function of the particular antioxidants used is unclear, and 
planned trials with XO inhibitors and other alternative agents 
should help answer this question. The role of hypoxia-induced 
alterations in gene expression in the genesis of heart failure also 
remains unclear, although experimental data suggest that these 
changes in gene expression can be either adaptive or maladaptive, 
depending on context. Given the central role of oxygen in cardio￾vascular biology, further investigational focus on oxygen-related 
processes in the genesis of heart failure is warranted.
