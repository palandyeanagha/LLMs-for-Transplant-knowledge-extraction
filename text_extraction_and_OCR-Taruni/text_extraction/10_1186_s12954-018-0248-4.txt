Abstract
Background: Recent advances in the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection provide the possibility of
eliminating HCV as a public health threat. This focus on HCV elimination through treatment, however, is also driving
a concomitant focus on ‘achieving cure’ as the primary outcome of treatment. The aim of this paper is to explore
what people who inject drugs consider to be important in relation to outcomes of HCV treatment, and whether
there are outcomes ‘beyond cure’ that might be important to understand as part of improving engagement in
treatment.
Methods: A peer researcher with experience of both HCV treatment and injecting drug use conducted interviews
with 24 people in the following groups in Melbourne, Australia: (1) people who had refused or deferred HCV
treatment; (2) people who were actively thinking about, planning and/or about to commence HCV treatment; (3)
people currently undertaking HCV treatment and (4) people who had recently completed HCV treatment.
Results: The findings show that people who inject drugs are seeking outcomes ‘beyond cure’ including improved
physical and mental health, positive changes in identity and social relationships and managing future health and
risk. Participants indicated that these other outcomes had not been addressed within their experience of HCV
treatment.
Conclusion: While cure is an obvious outcome of HCV treatment, patients are seeking change in other areas of
their lives. This study also provides valuable insights for the development of patient-reported measures in this
context, which would be an important step towards more patient-centred approaches to HCV treatment.

Background
In recent years, there have been significant advances in
therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of hepatitis C virus
(HCV) treatment medications [1]. Direct acting antiviral
(DAA) therapies are more efficacious and of shorter
duration, with a lower side effect profile, than previous
longstanding interferon-based treatments [2, 3]. These
advances open up the possibility of HCV elimination as
a public health challenge [4]. The main risk factor for
HCV infection in Australia and many other countries is
the use of unsterile equipment for drug injection [5],
making people who inject drugs a key group to engage
in HCV treatment.
The possibility of HCV elimination (as a public health
challenge) drives a focus on cure (i.e. sustained viro￾logical response) as the key outcome of treatment. The
focus on curative HCV treatments also draws from the
‘cascade of care’ concept which seeks to describe and
quantify each step in the spectrum of engagement in
care and treatment [6]. In HCV literature, the construc￾tions of care cascades overwhelmingly conclude with a
measure of the proportion of treated individuals who
achieve a cure [7, 8]. What gets measured and reported
in these cascades are a pragmatic mix of available data
(such as from routine surveillance or from records of
prescriptions) and often supported by mathematical * Correspondence: c.treloar@unsw.edu.au 1

modelling (which again draws upon available data). People
who inject drugs and who are living with HCV have not
had the opportunity to critique and inform this cascade to
include measures important to them, such as outcomes
other than cure.
While attaining a cure is undoubtedly the main ration￾ale behind people having HCV treatments, affected
people may prioritise other outcomes. For example,
there is an emergent literature exploring what people
who inject drugs expect and hope from DAA therapies,
beyond cure. One longitudinal qualitative study con￾ducted in the UK asked people undergoing a mix of
interferon-based and DAA therapies for their views on
treatment benefit [9]. Participants identified a range of
social benefits, including social reconnection, social re￾demption and a return to ‘normality’. This study also
found important differences between discourses and
debates that emphasise the public health benefits of
HCV treatment and the benefits as perceived by people
undertaking treatment.
Differences between patient and provider views of
treatment outcomes have been widely documented
across the health sector [10]. To identify and better
understand these differences, there has been increasing
international interest in the development and use of pa￾tient reported measures (PRMs). PRMs focus on what
matters to patients rather than to clinicians or other
stakeholders. They allow patients to evaluate the success
of health interventions and provide feedback to health￾care providers about the issues that matter to them as
patients [11–15].
Despite the growing use of PRMs in many areas of
medicine [16], they have received remarkably little atten￾tion within the alcohol and other drug (AOD) sector.
This likely reflects the fact that, historically, people who
use drug treatment services have not tended to be con￾sulted in treatment decision making [17] and not seen as
‘credible’ patients. Moreover, injecting drug use can pro￾duce a master identity status, which colours perception
of all other aspects of these patients’ lives [18]. In this
context, stigma and discrimination can also influence
whether or not people who inject drugs will seek DAA
therapies and, among those who do, what their experi￾ences of treatment are [19].
The aim of this paper is to explore what people who
inject drugs consider to be the important outcomes of
HCV treatment beyond cure in order to better under￾stand their engagement with DAA therapies, and also to
identify factors that might be relevant to the develop￾ment of a new PRM for HCV treatment.
Methods
This study adopted a participatory approach. A partici￾patory approach seeks to understand experience and
knowledge through a process of collective inquiry, collab￾oration and reflection [20, 21]. The participatory design of
this study included the engagement of a peer researcher
(AM, first author) with direct experience of both injecting
drug use and HCV treatment with DAAs. The involve￾ment of a peer researcher was also useful for creating a
‘safe space’ for the exploration of the subjective experi￾ences of people who inject drugs (a highly marginalised
community) in an era of rapidly expanding biomedical
responses to HCV infection.
Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24
people who self-reported living with HCV, were 18 years
and over, and who had a recent history of injecting drug
use. Participants were recruited through community-based
networks of people who inject drugs in Melbourne,
Australia, in collaboration with a community partner or￾ganisation, Harm Reduction Victoria. Six participants were
recruited across each of four groups: (1) people who had
refused or deferred treatment for HCV with DAAs; (2)
people who were actively thinking about, planning and/or
about to commence treatment for HCV with DAAs; (3)
people currently undertaking treatment for HCV with
DAAs and (4) people who had recently completed
treatment for HCV with DAAs.
Interviews were conducted between December 2016 and
March 2017, were of 20–30 min duration, and were all
conducted by the peer researcher. Participants were asked
to provide a biographical snapshot including their experi￾ence of diagnosis, knowledge and expectations of HCV
treatment, current health and well-being, future/life follow￾ing treatment and basic demographic information. Each
participant was paid AUD $20 for their time and expertise.
The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verba￾tim and edited to remove any identifying information. The
first phase of data analysis was conducted using an inter￾pretative thematic analysis approach based on an iterative,
inductive process whereby three members of the research
team read each transcript to identify recurring themes and
patterns of meaning within the data [22]. These team
members then met to discuss and agree upon the most
prominent themes and patterns which were then each
assigned a code. From this process, a coding framework
was developed based on the key thematic categories, and
the transcripts were re-read by the peer researcher to
identify any further instances of the key themes within the
data. The third phase of analysis involved identifying rele￾vant narrative excerpts from each interview transcript
which were then added into the coding document under
the relevant thematic category. This document was then
used as the basis for the development of this paper.
Results
Participants included nine women and 15 men with an
age range of 28–64 years. Two participants identified as

Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders. Three participants
reported unstable housing and eight participants were
living in public housing. Most (n = 15) received govern￾ment benefits as their main source of income, and eight
participants reported full-time or part-time employment.
Nine participants reported completing high school
education to year 12 or above (see Table 1 for further
details). Themes pertaining to DAA treatment outcomes
beyond cure comprised physical and psychological
health, understanding clinical markers and future liver
health, issues regarding reinfection, identity and social
connections and stigma and discrimination.
People who had refused or deferred treatment for HCV
with DAAs (i.e. group 1 participants, n = 6) were asked dur￾ing interviews to comment on the reasons for declining
DAA treatment, rather than reporting their expectations
and hopes ‘beyond cure’. As such, data from group 1 were
not included in the analysis for this paper but instead are
presented in a forthcoming publication about the barriers
to DAA treatment [Beyond interferon side effects: what re￾sidual barriers exist to DAA hepatitis C treatment for
people who inject drugs? forthcoming]. In summary, data
from group 1 highlighted a variety of participants’ personal
and structural vulnerabilities that were significant barriers
to DAA treatment, including difficulties in acquiring a
HCV diagnosis, poor venous access to provide sufficient
blood for DAA testing, poor mental health, ongoing prob￾lems related to drug dependence, unstable housing and past
experiences of healthcare-related stigma and discrimination.
To meet the aims of this paper, the findings below are
drawn from the three groups of participants who either
were preparing for DAA treatment, having treatment or
had completed treatment.
Better physical and mental health after HCV DAA
treatment and hopes for a healthier future
Some participants had expectations of how HCV treat￾ment would make them feel physically, psychologically
and emotionally in the immediate post-treatment period
such as feeling better, sleeping better, eating better, feel￾ing more positive and being healthier. Participants who
had either recently completed treatment themselves or
knew others who had recently completed treatment,
spoke about the transformative effect of clearing the
virus on people’s health, energy levels and even on their
overall appearance: ‘almost like they were sparkling’.
Since treatment, I have a lot more energy,
I’m much more active, I feel a lot happier.
(male, group 4, 33 years)
One participant, who had previously undertaken un￾successful interferon-based HCV treatments, described
the effect of finally clearing the virus following treatment
with DAAs as ‘amazing’ and ‘like lifting a veil type thing’.
Others explained that the outcome they valued most
was reduced concern about the impact of chronic HCV
infection on their liver health into the future.
It’s not so much about becoming healthier, it’s about
trying to prevent… it’s more of a preventative measure
for me than becoming healthier. I’m hoping that by
doing treatment and taking the sort of tax off my liver,
that will enhance my health in the future, as opposed to
making me healthier now. (female, group 3, 58 years)
For some participants, however, the ‘promises’ and ex￾pectations associated with clearing the virus they had
lived with for decades had not transpired. Some were
disappointed that a sustained virological response had
not lived up to their expectations of feeling better, of
having more energy and being able to get ‘on with life’
and ‘make up for lost time’. Indeed, some participants
stated that although they initially felt great after com￾pleting treatment, this feeling did not last and they now
found themselves feeling quite depressed and ‘let down’
both by the ‘hype’ and broader expectations of a ‘better
life’ promised from a cure.

Understanding liver health and infectiousness and having
a plan for post-treatment care
Participants with moderate to serious liver damage, in￾cluding cirrhosis, reported that they did not have suffi￾cient information about the ongoing risk of liver disease
following viral clearance. Participants seemed to be
largely unaware, and uninformed, of the potential for
ongoing liver disease (including a possible life-long risk
of liver cancer), and a need for ongoing monitoring of
liver health for those diagnosed with moderate to serious
fibrosis and/or cirrhosis prior to commencing treatment.
Of the participants who were currently undergoing DAA
treatment or who had recently completed DAA treat￾ment, none were aware of any plans for ongoing liver
health management including the need for ongoing liver
function tests or liver ultrasounds. This is highlighted by
the response of one participant who, despite stating he
had diagnosed liver damage of at least medium level fibro￾sis prior to commencing treatment with the DAAs and
was at least 6 months post treatment at the time of inter￾view, responded in the following way when asked about
whether anyone on his treatment team had spoken with
him about the need for ongoing monitoring:
No, they haven’t asked. Nobody’s really… yeah I don’t
think at the time there’s any call for monitoring
beyond SVR12. (male, group 4, 56 years)
Related to this issue was the lack of information, and
clarity, about whether participants would remain ‘infec￾tious’ following viral clearance. The lack of an explan￾ation regarding HCV infectiousness, ‘beyond cure’, was a
problem for some people in this study who wanted to be
certain they could no longer transmit the virus to others,
including their children and grandchildren, because
following successful treatment for HCV, people will re￾main HCV antibody positive despite being HCV PCR
negative. Several participants spoke about the relief
and how ‘nice’ it was not to have to worry about
their blood in the health care setting due to the risk
of stigma, but also in the household context and not
having to be concerned about potentially exposing
family and friends to hepatitis C. Some of these same
participants, however, also spoke about a lingering
doubt in relation to infectiousness post treatment. For
example, in response to being asked about whether
she would feel the need to tell people about having
had hepatitis C in the past now that she had cleared
the virus, one participant said:
I reckon I need to clarify that because, I think you still
have got a low level, haven’t you, of something in
your system? (female, group 4, 63 years; participant
emphasis added)
Creating a new identity and enhancing social connections
The potential positive impact of curing HCV for a per￾son’s identity and their sense of self when in social inter￾actions with friends, family and in society generally was
raised by most participants. Participants explained that
being cured of HCV removed the stress of disclosing
HCV status. Participants expressed residual shame or
internalised stigma about having an infection, or being
treated for an infection, that is widely associated with
injecting drug use. Participants described the relief of
not having to manage their daily interactions and routines
in order to avoid the stigma associated with the infection.
For example, in anticipation of life after DAA therapy, some
simply welcomed the sense of relief that ‘being hep C free’
would bring, particularly with close friends and family,
whom they believed would view them more favourably.
Others felt that being ‘hep C free’ would mean that they
could also leave the ‘drug user’ label behind—not because
they necessarily had stopped using drugs, but because
clearing HCV infection would, among many things, present
an opportunity to create a new, virally untainted identity.
It would be nice not to always have to say, “I have hep
C” or “I’m a hep C carrier” or however you put it and
it doesn’t really need to be something that I need to
disclose, because I still have that feeling of “oh so, to
have got hep C even though there are other ways of
getting hep C, it always brings me back to being that
drug user”. It’s not something that I’m ashamed of,
but it’s not something that I want as part of my life,
you know running with me parallel for the whole of
my life. (female, group 3, 58 years)
I won’t feel like I’m diseased. Like I’m carrying around
something that is dirty to the world… You know what I
mean? I won’t be scared about meeting people anymore
and talking to them because I have nothing to hide. At
the moment I am hiding two things and living a lie and
I don’t want to do that anymore. Once I’m hep C free I
can move on. (female, group 2, 41 years)
Some participants anticipated that the outcomes of
HCV treatment (such as enhanced emotional health and
well-being and impact on identity) would have a positive
impact on their intimate relationships and their ability
to better meet family and work commitments.
I feel bad for my kids, because I want them to have a
mum to be proud of. I want to be able to take them
out, I want to be able to go to the school and talk to
the other mums, but I feel ashamed of myself and I
feel like I’m not up to the standard they deserve.
(female, group 2, 41 years)
Madden et al. Harm Reduction Journal (2018) 15:42 Page 4 of 8

Participants identified a variety of interpretations of
‘hep C free’. For example, they described clearing HCV
infection in terms of ‘moving on’ to a life of better
health, a new identity and expanded opportunities for
social connections. Conversely, clearing the infection
was also viewed as losing something intrinsic to one’s
identity, particularly given that HCV is a long-term, slow
progressing chronic disease that most participants had
lived with for numerous decades. People who had lived
with HCV for many years reported a range of affective
responses from clearing their infection:
I don’t think it’s something that clinicians and that
think about. That for some people it is a massive
thing and it’s kind of like mourning … it’s like when
you stop using drugs and you kind of mourn that …
It’s like a huge part of your identity so then to let that
go, then you have to fill that with something else and
you’ve got to find that energy somewhere else. …but I
think that’s the same with any chronic illness. Surely
that’s a thing, surely some shrink has put it in blog or
something by now. (female, group 3, 42 years)
Equipped to avoid or manage new infections
Most participants in this study held strong views on the
issue of HCV risk after treatment. While some stated
they would feel upset and angry with themselves if they
were to become reinfected, others said they would be
shocked and surprised: ‘I can’t imagine how that would
happen’. Most participants said that they would not feel
guilty if they acquired another HCV infection. A few
made the distinction between feeling guilty and feeling
embarrassed about acquiring HCV again, but most said
that it would not prevent them from coming forward for
retreatment because it ‘is what it is’ and re-treatment
would be ‘much more important than any embar￾rassment I might feel about becoming reinfected’.
Those who did express reluctance in coming forward
should they acquire HCV again did so mostly out of
concern for the high cost to the health system of the
new treatments.
Participants were also highly confident that they could
avoid reinfection. The belief that they were extremely
unlikely to be reinfected stemmed largely from their
ability to access information and services (including nee￾dle and syringe programs) in a way that was not the case
when they first acquired the virus. For others, however,
safer injecting was firmly embedded in their routine
practice, such that even contemplating acquiring a new
HCV infection seemed almost confrontational.
It’s not likely to happen. It’s really unlikely to happen!
Um, in fact if it did happen, something would have
seriously fucked up for me. Something really
significant will have happened in my decision-making
processes to allow that, that risk, to happen. Yeah that
would be pretty significant. (male, group 2, 50 years;
participant emphasis added)
Despite the high level of confidence among partici￾pants in relation to avoiding reinfection following suc￾cessful HCV treatment, participants identified a general
lack of discussion and information on harm reduction
and safer injecting practices in HCV treatment services
and associated AOD health services. For example, in
response to being asked if healthcare professionals had
discussed the potential for reinfection with him follow￾ing successful HCV treatment, and what he might need
to do to ensure he remained hepatitis C free, this partici￾pant responded by saying that no one had raised this
issue with him:
I think ‘cause they know me so well. I’ve known them
all for years – most of them. They already sort of
know me and they know the way that I do things.
They know that they didn’t need to bring that sort of
thing up maybe… I dunno… maybe… but I think that
would be a factor. (male, group 4, 39 years).
Discussion
DAA therapies cure HCV infection in a majority of
cases. This is an advance in clinical treatment that can
support goals to drastically reduce HCV morbidity and
mortality. Like any condition, cure is only one aspect of
therapy for the patient. In this study, people who
injected drugs and were living with HCV articulated a
range of outcomes that they valued including enhanced
physical and mental health, avoiding a need to disclose
HCV infection, better social relationships, changes in
identity, a positive orientation to the future and being
equipped to manage future health and risk. While the
majority of people undergoing HCV DAA treatment will
achieve cure, these other outcomes will not necessarily
be achieved unless services reorientate to a more
patient-centred approach beyond cure. Further, efforts to
promote treatment should engage with the varying out￾comes being sought by this group.
The clinical literature has established a benefit of SVR
to health related quality of life [23] and higher quality of
life scores among people undertaking DAA treatment
compared with people experiencing earlier generation
interferon-containing treatments [24]. These results may
feed the ‘promise’ and ‘hype’ reported by participants in
this study. Care should be taken when extrapolating re￾search results to the experience of individual patients
that the ‘promise’ of greater feelings of well-being do not
Madden et al. Harm Reduction Journal (2018) 15:42 Page 5 of 8

become entrenched in clinical (or health promotion)
scripts when describing treatment effects but that variabil￾ity in response is acknowledged. Further, while DAAs are
undoubtedly a very significant step forward in tolerability
of treatment, a focus on comparing old (interferon-based)
with new (interferon-free) might also feed the ‘hype’. For
those who have not undertaken previous interferon-based
treatments, these comparisons are irrelevant.
In this study, removing a need to disclose HCV infec￾tion was a valued outcome from DAA treatments. Dis￾closure of HCV infection is a potentially stressful event
for affected people because the condition is closely asso￾ciated with injecting drug use. Our findings indicated
that among participants who had cleared HCV following
DAA treatment, some were able to forge a new identity,
and enhance their social connections [9], in part because
a cure removed the stress of having to disclose HCV. In￾deed, the stress of disclosing HCV has been highlighted
in previous research where negative reactions have been
documented following disclosure, especially in health￾care settings [25]. This is a key concern given that the
promotion of DAA treatments is central to elimination
efforts aimed at curbing future HCV-related morbidity,
mortality and healthcare costs associated with liver dis￾ease. The fear of HCV-related stigma and discrimination
from within the healthcare sector following HCV disclos￾ure decreases the likelihood that affected people will ac￾cess healthcare settings to commence DAA treatments.
Our findings regarding disclosure corroborate those of
other studies and an Australian state-government enquiry,
over the past 20 years [26–28].
Given the stigma associated with HCV (and by associ￾ated, drug use), it may be surprising that some partici￾pants expressed concern that they would experience a loss
of identity in being ‘hep C free’. To identify as a person
with HCV who injects drugs is a political act, due to the
socio-legal sanctions ascribed to the social practice of
injecting drug use [29] and the perceived threat to com￾munity represented by infectious disease [30]. Historically,
people with identities and practices that are perceived as
threatening, and which are subsequently marginalised by
institutions such as healthcare, have at times effectively
organised political action and extended support to fellow
‘travellers’, creating movements and moments where a
sense of solidarity through common purpose and shared
hope for the future prevail [31–33]. Throughout both the
HIV and HCV epidemics, for example, substantial strides
were made by highly organised, international groups of
substance users in relation to harm reduction, drug law
reform, the visibility of drug users, their rights to respect
and the right to healthcare, among other social justice re￾forms [34]. It is not entirely surprising then that in some
ways, for some people, HCV infection comes to represent
a struggle for visibility, legitimacy and equality in a hostile
world, and that being cured of the infection removes posi￾tive aspects of ‘otherness’ that affected people highly
value, and when gone, profoundly miss.
While representations of the cascade of care typic￾ally conclude with ‘cure’ [7, 8], efforts to achieve
elimination require ongoing efforts to prevent reinfec￾tion [35]. Participants in this study expressed strong
concerns about the prospect of reinfection and were
confident that they could avoid this. International
studies show that the prevalence of reinfection among
people who inject drugs is low, at less than 5 per 100
person years [36, 37]. Nevertheless, those who do ac￾quire new infections tend to be those involved in
injecting networks, since injecting places them at risk
of acquisition and, possibly, transmission of hepatitis
C. The cascade of care needs to be reformulated, or
expanded, to address reinfection and ongoing liver
damage if we are to capitalise on the opportunities
that HCV DAA therapies provide. All patients should
be offered support during and after treatment to avoid
reinfection particularly in settings such as AOD treat￾ment programs where patients may be expected or
assumed to be abstinent, and there can be risks to ad￾missions of ongoing drug use [38]. Additionally, there
can be an ongoing risk of liver disease among people
who achieve a HCV cure [39]. Preparing people during
HCV treatment with information and a liver health
plan can minimise the incidence and resultant costs of
future liver disease. Rates of reinfection and liver
disease post treatment are not currently included in
HCV cascades of care.
These data were collected in Australia in which there
is a universal access policy for HCV DAA therapy. How￾ever, experiences of prohibition and criminalization of
injecting drug use are global, and issues of stigma and
mistrust related to hepatitis C permeate the international
literature [40]. Hence, the findings related to the themes
of identity, perceived infectiousness and social connec￾tions may be applicable to other settings. Other settings
which have specific limitations for treatment eligibility,
access to prevention services and treatment for re￾infection [41–43] may generate other outcomes for
this patient group.
Conclusion
The possibility of DAA treatments leading to elimin￾ation of HCV has excited the interests of many.
However, there could be an inherent tension be￾tween the goals of HCV elimination projects and the
outcomes that people who inject drugs value and ex￾pect from HCV treatment, which could undermine
elimination efforts. Despite these very transactional
concerns, it is no less important to understand what
people who inject drugs want and need as outcomes of
Madden et al. Harm Reduction Journal (2018) 15:42 Page 6 of 8

HCV treatment. This is an ethical proposition and the
foundations of patient-centred responses to HCV that
value community knowledge [44, 45]. The insights from
this study could be used to underpin patient-reported
measures for use in clinical and research settings to expand
the ways in which HCV treatment is understood and
valued.
