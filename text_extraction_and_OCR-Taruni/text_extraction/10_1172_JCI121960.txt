Introduction
The humoral immune response is well recognized as playing an 
essential role in protection against pathogens. However, accumu￾lating data implicate B cells and Abs, not only in protection against 
new infections, but also in their ongoing control (1–3). How their 
contribution may fail in chronic viral infections remains poorly 
understood; while much progress has been made in identifying 
targets underpinning T cell exhaustion in the setting of persistent 
antigenic stimulation, analogous defects in B cell responses are 
less well studied. A detailed understanding of the constraints on 
pathogen-specific B cell responses will identify new therapeutic 
targets for harnessing this arm of the immune response.
The prototypic humoral immune response is regarded as the 
differentiation of pathogen-specific memory B cells (MBC) into 
plasma cells capable of producing Abs that neutralize infectiv￾ity. However, other Ab effector functions often mediate addi￾tional important antiviral effects, using their capacity to harness 
innate and adaptive cellular responses. In HIV infection, Abs that 
are potently neutralizing have been shown to rely heavily on Fc 
receptor–binding activity for their efficacy (4). The Fc region of 
Abs allows them to leverage Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity 
(ADCC) or phagocytosis (ADCP) through binding to Fc receptors 
on NK cells or phagocytes, respectively, thereby promoting elimi￾nation of infected cells (5). In addition, by binding complement 
or forming immune complexes, Abs can promote complement￾dependent cytotoxicity or antigen presentation to T cells, respec￾tively (5–7). Beyond Abs, B cells are increasingly recognized as 
having additional important antiviral roles, including antigen pre￾sentation (7, 8) and the production of cytokines (9). Thus, it is cru￾cial to consider the full spectrum of diverse antiviral roles of B cells 
that could be disabled in the setting of persistent viral infections.
The hepatotropic hepatitis B virus (HBV) can establish 
a chronic infection of a type that continues to kill more than 
700,000 people every year and is therefore a major focus for the 
development of new therapeutic approaches (10). The efficacy 
of Abs directed against a component of the HBV envelope (HBV 
surface antigen [HBsAg]) in protection against de novo infec￾tion is well established: they are used therapeutically to limit 
maternofetal transmission or infection of liver transplants and 
constitute the basis of the preventative vaccine (11). Following 
successful resolution of acute HBV, evidenced by the develop￾ment of anti-HBs Abs, residual intrahepatic HBV episomal DNA 
is successfully maintained under long-term immune control 
(10). Although the development of anti-HBs Abs is the hallmark 
of natural resolution of HBV, they have long been regarded as 
important in the prevention of reinfection rather than in ongo￾ing immune control. However, an indispensable contribution of 
B cells are increasingly recognized as playing an important role in the ongoing control of hepatitis B virus (HBV). The 
development of antibodies against the viral surface antigen (HBV surface antigen [HBsAgs]) constitutes the hallmark 
of resolution of acute infection and is a therapeutic goal for functional cure of chronic HBV (CHB). We characterized B 
cells directly ex vivo from the blood and liver of patients with CHB to investigate constraints on their antiviral potential. 
Unexpectedly, we found that HBsAg-specific B cells persisted in the blood and liver of many patients with CHB and were 
enriched for T-bet, a signature of antiviral potential in B cells. However, purified, differentiated HBsAg-specific B cells from 
patients with CHB had defective antibody production, consistent with undetectable anti-HBs antibodies in vivo. HBsAg￾specific and global B cells had an accumulation of CD21–
CD27–
 atypical memory B cells (atMBC) with high expression of 
inhibitory receptors, including PD-1. These atMBC demonstrated altered signaling, homing, differentiation into antibody￾producing cells, survival, and antiviral/proinflammatory cytokine production that could be partially rescued by PD-1 blockade. 
Analysis of B cells within healthy and HBV-infected livers implicated the combination of this tolerogenic niche and HBV 
infection in driving PD-1hiatMBC and impairing B cell immunity.

Results
HBsAg-specific B cells persist in CHB with impaired potential to pro￾duce Abs. To investigate whether B cells specific for HBsAg cir￾culate in chronic infection, we first tested a sensitive method for 
their direct ex vivo detection. Using a fluorescently labeled HBsAg 
bait, we were able to stain a population of antigen-specific B cells 
(CD45+
CD3–
CD19+
CD20+
) within peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMC) from an HBsAg-vaccinated donor (ENGERIX-B), 
allowing quantitation by flow cytometry (Figure 1A, gating strat￾egy; Supplemental Figure 1A; supplemental material available 
online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI121960DS1). 
The frequency of circulating HBsAg-specific B cells determined 
by this method was within the range for vaccinated donors esti￾mated previously using a 2-step enrichment staining protocol 
(30). A threshold for a positive response was set using the mean 
+ 1 standard deviation of the background staining seen in a cohort 
of unexposed controls (0.18% of B cells, Supplemental Figure 1B). 
This compromise cutoff left 4 of 24 unexposed donor stains just 
above the threshold, implying that responses at this threshold fre￾quency must be interpreted with caution. To validate the reagent, 
we sorted the HBsAg bait–stained and bait–negative B cell frac￾tions from a vaccinated donor and assessed their functionality 
after culture using ELISpot and ELISA. Cells selected using the 
HBsAg-specific bait differentiated into HBsAg-specific plasma 
cells detectable by ELISpot and produced more than 1,000 IU/ml 
of anti-HBs Ab by ELISA (Figure 1B). In contrast, cells from the 
bait-negative fraction were devoid of HBsAg-reactive responses, 
as determined by ELISpot, and produced no detectable anti-HBs 
Ab, as shown by ELISA (Figure 1B).
To further validate the specificity and sensitivity of the HBsAg 
bait, we used it to stain peripheral B cells from healthy donors 
sampled repeatedly during the course of preventative HBV vacci￾nation (ENGERIX-B, containing recombinant HBsAg adsorbed on 
aluminium hydroxide). Detection of HBsAg-specific B cells above 
the background threshold of staining coincided with the develop￾ment of a detectable anti-HBs Ab response in sera from 2 vacci￾nated donors (Figure 1C). Two donors who only received the first 2 
doses of the vaccine failed to develop a detectable Ab response, as 
shown by ELISA, or an HBsAg-specific B cell response above the 
threshold (Supplemental Figure 1C).
Having validated the specificity of the HBsAg bait, we then 
used it to test for circulating HBsAg-specific B cells in a cohort of 84 
subjects with CHB. Despite their lack of detectable serum anti-HBs 
Abs, we were able to detect HBsAg bait–staining B cells above the 
background threshold in 68% of the cohort at frequencies compa￾rable to those of a cohort previously vaccinated with HBsAg (Figure 
1D). Both subjects with CHB and vaccinees had significantly higher 
frequencies of HBsAg bait–staining B cells than unexposed controls 
or patients infected with HCV (Figure 1D). The frequency of HBsAg￾specific B cells showed no relationship with circulating antigen load 
in vivo (serum HBsAg concentration, Figure 1E), HBV DNA, ala￾nine transaminase (ALT), or clinical disease phase (Supplemental 
Figure 1, D–F). HBsAg-specific B cells were also detectable in some 
MBC to the control of residual infection has now been revealed 
by the observation that in vivo depletion of CD20-expressing 
cells by rituximab can drive viral rebound in some cases with 
serological evidence of prior HBV infection (anti-HBc ± anti￾HBs) (12–14). Rituximab can precipitate HBV reactivation when 
used for B cell lymphomas, renal transplantation, or autoimmune 
diseases (12, 13), and the risk is increased in cases lacking preex￾isting anti-HBs Abs (14). Of note, rituximab does not deplete ter￾minally differentiated plasma cells that typically downregulate 
CD20, suggesting a requirement for MBC for the maintenance 
of HBV control in these cases.
Despite this evidence for the importance of B cells in HBV 
control, little is known about the features and potential roles of B 
cell immunity once chronic HBV (CHB) infection is established. 
In this setting, subjects have Abs to HBV core antigen (HBcAg), 
a T cell–independent antigen that elicits a robust Ab response in 
all exposed individuals (15). However, these chronic carriers do 
not have detectable Abs to HBsAg in their sera (11). This implies 
that either concentrations of anti-HBs Abs synthesized are very 
low or that they are insufficient for overcoming absorption by the 
large quantities of HBsAg present in CHB. HBsAg is released as 
subviral particles in several-fold excess to full virions, which has 
been postulated as serving as an immune evasion mechanism, 
subverting any anti-HBs Abs produced and forming immune 
complexes in the circulation (16–18). An inherent deficiency of B 
cells able to synthesize anti-HBs Abs was first suggested as being 
a feature of CHB more than 30 years ago (19, 20). One potential 
mechanism for their depletion was proposed to be the deletion 
of B cells crosspresenting HBsAg on MHC class I by cytotoxic T 
lymphocytes (7). However, the lack of techniques for identifying 
antigen-specific B cells directly ex vivo has precluded determina￾tion of whether HBsAg-specific B cells are numerically depleted 
and/or functionally inhibited/defective. Moreover, other antiviral 
functions of B cells have not been comprehensively determined 
in CHB, nor have the characteristics of intrahepatic B cells been 
analyzed. Prior study of the peripheral global B cell compartment 
has shown impaired proliferation and increased expression of 
CXCR3 (21), while a regulatory population of B cells producing 
IL-10 has been shown to be expanded in flares of CHB disease 
activity (22). However, B cell production of IL-6 and TNF-α, cyto￾kines with potent anti-HBV capacity (23–27), has not previously 
been assessed.
Here, we applied a fluorescent bait reagent allowing flow cyto￾metric quantitation of HBsAg-specific B cells to reveal that they 
are maintained in many subjects with CHB and not reduced in fre￾quency compared with vaccinated or naturally resolved controls. 
Using this method, we carried out direct ex vivo phenotypic profil￾ing in a cohort of 84 patients with CHB to probe for mechanisms 
restraining their functionality. We found that a substantial propor￾tion of HBsAg-specific B cells have the phenotype of atypical MBC 
(atMBC, CD21–
CD27–
, also known as tissue-like MBC or aged B 
cells), a functionally defective subset recently found to accumu￾late in settings of repetitive pathogen exposure (reviewed in refs. 
28, 29). atMBC are also expanded within the peripheral global B 
cell compartment in CHB and, to a greater extent, in the HBV￾infected liver of these individuals. We observe that the expanded 
atMBC in CHB have defective signaling, survival, antiviral cyto-

Next, we investigated whether HBsAg-specific B cells detect￾ed in CHB were capable of differentiating into Ab-producing 
cells. HBsAg-specific B cells FACS sorted from donors with CHB 
and cultured to promote differentiation into plasma cells failed to 
produce detectable levels of anti-HBs IgG (<10 IU/ml). In striking 
contrast, an equivalent number of bait-sorted HBsAg-specific B 
cells from vaccinated healthy controls (HC) differentiated in vitro 
patients sampled during acute HBV, but were again at very low fre￾quencies and showed a tendency to decrease rather than increase in 
the circulation when these donors were resampled around the time 
of HBsAg clearance (Figure 1F and Supplemental Figure 2, A and 
B). Temporal analysis through the course of acute-resolving HBV 
showed no consistent relationship with viral load, serology, or liver 
inflammation (Figure 1G and Supplemental Figure 2, A and B).

ers CD11c and CXCR3 (29). We found that T-bet expression was 
increased in atMBC in CHB (particularly within the CD19hi frac￾tion) compared with their cMBC counterparts; consistent with 
this, the majority of B cells within the total T-bethi fraction had an 
atMBC phenotype (Figure 3, A and B).
atMBC in CHB expressed higher levels of the inflamma￾tory homing marker CD11c compared with cMBC (Figure 3C). 
Expression of CD11c and the liver-homing chemokine CXCR3 was 
enriched within T-betint and T-bethi B cells (Figure 3D), as previously 
described (29, 31, 32). In contrast, the lymph node–homing chemo￾kine CXCR5 was expressed on cMBC, but not on atMBC (Figure 
3E). Congruent with this, atMBC had lower expression of the acti￾vation/costimulation marker CD80 than cMBC (Figure 3F), and 
the proportion that had undergone class switching was intermedi￾ate between naive and cMBC (Figure 3G). Combined, these data 
indicate that the profile of atMBC in CHB does not support homing 
to secondary lymphoid organs for the productive T cell interactions 
required for protective Ab production (33), but instead may favor 
migration to inflamed tissues, such as the HBV-infected liver.
atMBC in CHB express multiple inhibitory receptors. In addi￾tion to the impaired signals attributable to downregulation of 
CD27 and CD21, atMBC can be constrained by inhibitory recep￾tors. Such inhibitory receptors limit BCR signaling (28, 34–36) in 
a manner analogous to the well-described function of checkpoints 
on exhausted T cells. Known inhibitory receptors include B and 
T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) and CD22, which were both 
increased on atMBC compared with cMBC in CHB (Figure 4A). 
Two further inhibitory receptors, Fcy
RIIB and FcRL5, which bind 
to the Fc portion of Abs (37–39), were also upregulated on CHB 
atMBC (Figure 4B). The expression of FcRL5, in particular, was 
strikingly increased compared with the minimal expression seen 
on cMBC (Figure 4B). Finally, the prototypic T cell checkpoint 
PD-1 (40) was also expressed on a subset of atMBC and barely 
expressed on cMBC (Figure 4C).
Dimension reduction analysis using t-distributed stochas￾tic neighbor embedding (tSNE) showed that atMBC clustered as 
2 discrete populations when defined by the expression of FcRL5 
in addition to the CD27–
CD21–
 phenotype (Figure 4D). Global B 
cell PD-1 expression was concentrated in these regions, particu￾larly the cluster negative for IgM (class-switched FcRL5+
 B cells 
lacking CD21 and CD27), implicating it as a hallmark of antigen￾experienced atMBC in CHB (Figure 4D). Although some atMBC 
in HC and low-level HBV carriers expressed PD-1, this proportion 
was more than doubled in HBV carriers with higher viral loads 
(>2,000 IU/ml, Figure 4E).
To further investigate the relevance of these changes to anti￾viral immunity, we next examined the inhibitory receptor profile 
of HBsAg-specific B cells in patients with CHB, identified directly 
ex vivo by bait staining. The expression of both FcRL5 and PD-1 
was consistently enriched on HBsAg-specific B cells compared 
with their global B cell counterparts or with HBsAg-specific B cells 
in vaccinated controls (Figure 4, F and G). The other inhibitory 
receptors examined (BTLA, CD22, and Fcy
RIIB) were enriched 
on HBsAg-specific compared with global B cells, but not com￾pared with responses in vaccinees (Supplemental Figure 4, A–C). 
B cells expressing high levels of the transcription factor T-bet were 
increased more than 2-fold in the HBsAg-specific compared with 
to produce robust levels of anti-HBs (>1000 IU/ml) (Figure 1H). 
Thus, HBsAg-specific B cells were detectable directly ex vivo in 
CHB, but showed reduced capacity to produce anti-HBs Abs upon 
in vitro differentiation, consistent with the insufficient Ab produc￾tion characteristic of this stage of infection.
atMBC are expanded in CHB and enriched in the HBsAg-specific 
fraction. To investigate this defect in Ab-producing potential of 
HBsAg-specific B cells circulating in CHB, we first dissected their 
composition according to well-described MBC subsets. To do this, 
we took advantage of the capacity to stain HBsAg-specific B cells 
directly ex vivo, allowing characterization by surface phenotype. 
Among antigen-experienced B cells, conventional MBC are char￾acterized by the expression of CD27. They can be subdivided into 
classical MBC (cMBC), coexpressing CD27 and CD21 (component 
of the B cell receptor [BCR]), and activated MBC (actMBC), which 
retain CD27 but have downregulated expression of CD21. An addi￾tional subset, atMBC, lack expression of both CD27 and CD21 (28).
Using gating on CD10–
CD19+
CD20+
 B cells (to exclude any 
contribution to the CD21lo/– pool from immature transitional B 
cells or plasma cells), we compared the proportion of each sub￾set as a proportion of memory HBsAg-specific B cells in healthy 
vaccinated donors and subjects with CHB (Figure 2A). Cells with 
a cMBC phenotype were the principal component of HBsAg￾specific B cells in healthy vaccinated controls (Figure 2, A and 
B), consistent with the generation of a protective Ab response. 
However, in subjects with CHB, the HBsAg-specific cMBC popu￾lation (CD27+
CD21+
) was contracted and partially replaced by B 
cells with an atMBC phenotype (CD27–
CD21–
) alongside a smaller 
expansion of CD27+
CD21–
 actMBC (Figure 2, A and B). In exam￾ining the whole cohort, we found that atMBC accounted for a 
mean of 30% (maximum 90%) of HBsAg-specific B cells in CHB, 
a 2.6-fold increase compared with vaccinated controls (Figure 2, 
A and B). The proportion of atMBC within HBsAg-specific B cells 
was not associated with age within these cohorts (Figure 2A) and 
only showed a weak inverse correlation with HBsAg load (out of all 
clinical parameters examined, Supplemental Figure 3, A–D).
We next questioned whether the expansion of atMBC was a 
generalized feature of CHB or was restricted to the HBsAg-spe￾cific compartment. We found that atMBC were also significantly 
increased within the global B cell pool in 96 donors with CHB 
compared with 61 uninfected controls (Figure 2C), although the 
enrichment was notably more striking within the HBsAg-specific 
fraction of MBC (Figure 2D). Again, the expansion of atMBC did 
not clearly correlate with any clinical parameters (Supplemental 
Figure 3, E–H), only showing a trend to be reduced in resolved 
compared with acute infection (Figure 2E). To investigate this in 
more detail, we took advantage of longitudinal samples from 3 
patients taken during the course of acute-resolving HBV, reveal￾ing a tendency for atMBC to decrease following ALT flare (Figure 
2F and Supplemental Figure 3I).
atMBC in CHB are T-bethi with a homing profile favoring inflamed 
nonlymphoid tissues. To understand more about the features of the 
atMBC expanding in CHB and accumulating preferentially in the 
HBsAg-specific compartment, we probed for hallmarks of this 
dysfunctional population. The transcription factor T-bet has been 
shown to be induced in CD21–
 B cells during murine and human 
viral infections, associated with the inflammatory homing mark-

the global B cell compartment in CHB or compared with HBsAg￾specific B cells in uninfected vacinees (Figure 4H). In line with 
this, HBsAg-specific B cells also expressed more CD11c and less 
CXCR5 in CHB than controls (Supplemental Figure 4, D and E). 
In addition to being linked with atypical/aged MBC, T-bet has also 
been shown to be required for isotype switching and antiviral func￾tion in B cells (29, 31, 41–43). Thus PD-1hiT-bethiHBsAg-specific B 
cells may represent key antiviral effectors in CHB that are driven

bility to cell death might also be a factor limiting the differentia￾tion of atMBC to plasma cells in vivo, we stained them after BCR 
stimulation for the apoptosis marker annexin V. There was an 
increased proportion of atMBC-expressing annexin V compared 
with cMBC, indicative of an increased propensity to apoptosis 
(Figure 5G). Higher annexin V was seen on PD-1hi B cells (Figure 
5G), in line with the known proapoptotic function of this molecule 
in B cells (49).
Since increased PD-1 was a prominent feature of atMBC and 
HBsAg-specific B cells in CHB and is a clinically applicable immu￾notherapeutic target (10), we tested the potential of PD-1 blockade 
to rescue B cell responses in CHB. B cells within PBMC were stim￾ulated via their BCR and CD40 in the presence or absence of anti–
PD-1 blocking Abs. PD-1 blockade was able to significantly reduce 
B cell apoptosis, marked by annexin V (Figure 5H). To determine 
whether PD-1 blockade could rescue the effector potential of B 
cells in addition to their survival, we examined changes in their 
production of the key antiviral cytokine IL-6. The proportion of 
atMBC able to produce IL-6 upon BCR crosslinking was signifi￾cantly boosted in the presence of PD-1 blockade (Figure 5I). Con￾sistent with their lower expression of PD-1, cMBC did not increase 
IL-6 production upon PD-1 blockade (Figure 5I).
Taken together, these data suggest that the reduced signaling 
and higher propensity to apoptosis observed in B cells in CHB that 
have downregulated CD21 and CD27 and upregulated inhibitors 
such as PD-1 impair their antiviral capacity by reducing produc￾tion of IL-6 and TNF-α as well as limiting their differentiation into 
Ab-producing cells.
Antigen-specific and PD-1hi atMBC localize in the HBV-infected 
liver. atMBC in CHB expressed homing receptors that would be 
expected to promote their accumulation in inflamed sites, such 
as the liver. Little is known about B cells in the liver, the site of 
HBV replication and inflammation, and a tolerogenic organ. We 
postulated that the microenvironment of the HBV-infected liver 
may contribute to the accumulation of exhausted atMBC in this 
infection. Comparison of 27 paired blood and liver tissue samples 
from patients with CHB or uninfected controls revealed that the 
increase in atMBC seen in the global B cell compartment in the 
periphery was even more exaggerated in the liver (Figure 6A). The 
frequency of atMBC was particularly enriched in HBV-infected 
compared with uninfected livers (healthy margins of metastases 
or nonviral hepatitis, Figure 6B), pointing to a combined effect of 
the liver milieu and the virus in expanding this subset.
As noted in the periphery, atMBC in the liver had increased 
expression of the transcription factor T-bet, accounting for the 
large majority of the T-bethi fraction within intrahepatic B cells 
(Figure 6C). Intrahepatic atMBC also had significantly higher 
expression of inhibitory receptors, such as FcRL5 and PD-1, than 
cMBC in the liver (Figure 6D). Upregulation of PD-1 was particu￾larly striking in HBV-infected livers, where a maximum of 62% 
and a mean of 28% of atMBC were PD-1+
, contrasting with a mean 
of only 3% in healthy liver (Figure 6E).
Finally, in a subset of samples from HBV-infected livers, we 
obtained sufficient cells to stain with the HBsAg-specific bait and 
investigate whether HBV-specific B cells can infiltrate the site of 
infection. HBsAg-specific B cells were detectable within lympho￾cytes isolated from all HBV-infected livers tested, whereas only 
toward functional exhaustion by repetitive antigenic stimulation.
atMBC accumulating in CHB have impaired signaling and anti￾viral function, partially rescued by PD-1 blockade. Next, we investi￾gated whether the phenotypic changes observed in the expanded 
population of atMBC in CHB resulted in impaired functionality. 
To test responsiveness to antigen, we quantified calcium flux 
upon BCR engagement, a measure of proximal B cell signal￾ing reflective of the capacity for subsequent differentiation and 
effector function (44). Engagement of the BCR induced robust 
calcium mobilization in cMBC; this change in calcium levels 
upon BCR stimulation was markedly reduced in atMBC (Figure 
5A), as previously reported in subjects with malaria (44). In con￾trast, when stimulated with ionomycin, atMBC and cMBC dem￾onstrated a comparable capacity to mobilize calcium, suggesting 
that the atMBC defect could be bypassed by a strong BCR-inde￾pendent signal (Figure 5A). Phosphorylation of B cell linker pro￾tein (BLNK), an adaptor molecule important in coordinating BCR 
signaling, was also significantly diminished in atMBC compared 
with cMBC following BCR crosslinking (Figure 5B). Together, 
these data suggested that atMBC in CHB have attenuated BCR 
signaling, impairing their activation in response to antigen, but 
this reflects a “dampening” rather than complete unresponsiv￾ensss, suggesting the potential for rescue.
To test atMBC antiviral function, we first analyzed the capac￾ity of atMBC to produce cytokines in patients with CHB. B cells are 
increasingly recognized as being an important source of a num￾ber of cytokines in viral infections and other settings (9, 22, 45), 
among which both TNF-α and IL-6 could have potent noncyto￾lytic antiviral activity against HBV (23–27). The percentage of cells 
able to produce IL-6 or TNF-α upon crosslinking of the BCR in the 
presence of CD40 ligand (CD40L) was significantly less in atMBC 
compared with cMBC (Figure 5, C and D). Likewise, when stimu￾lated with a TLR7/8 agonist (resiquimod, R848), atMBC were sig￾nificantly impaired in their ability to produce both cytokines (Fig￾ure 5, C and D). These data suggest that atMBC in patients with 
CHB are functionally impaired, with reduced capacity to secrete 
important antiviral cytokines.
Another key role of MBC in pathogen immunity is their dif￾ferentiation into Ab-secreting plasma cells. Initial examination of 
plasma cell formation by ELISpot showed that global B cells iso￾lated from patients with CHB had defective differentiation to anti￾HBs–secreting plasma cells compared with vaccinated controls 
(Figure 5E), as previously reported (46–48). We therefore inves￾tigated whether impaired differentiation into anti-HBs–produc￾ing cells in CHB was partially attributable to their enrichment of 
atMBC. Pure populations of atMBC and cMBC were FACS sorted 
and stimulated with HBsAg, a TLR9 agonist (CpG-B), and cyto￾kines to compare their capacity to differentiate into plasma cells 
(IgD–

CD27+
). Comparison of a matched 
number of starting cells showed that significantly fewer atMBC 
differentiated into plasma cells compared with cMBC from the 
same donor (Figure 5F and Supplemental Figure 5). This suggests 
that impaired differentiation of atMBC into Ab-secreting cells 
may limit their production of anti-HBs.
During plasma cell differentiation, we noted reduced survival 
of those derived from atMBC compared with cMBC (Supplemen￾tal Figure 5). Therefore, to determine whether increased suscepti-

this study, we show that HBsAg-specific B cells circulate in many 
patients with CHB, but have defective production of anti-HBs 
Abs. Congruent with this functional deficit, pathogen-specific B 
cells and, to a lesser extent, the global B cell compartment have 
an accumulation of atMBC enriched for coinhibitory receptors, 
including PD-1 and FcRL5. atMBC from patients with CHB show 
attenuated signaling and cytokine production in response to BCR 
triggering and a diminished ability to escape apoptosis and dif￾ferentiate into Ab-producing plasma cells. In vitro PD-1 blockade 
with CD40L stimulation exemplifies the potential for therapeutic 
enhancement of B cell immunity in patients with CHB. Finally, we 
find that HBsAg-specific B cells can localize in the infected liver, 
where atMBC preferentially accumulate and upregulate PD-1.
atMBC have previously been identified in lymphoid tissue 
(51); we now find that they can also be sequestered in nonlymphoid 
organs, such as the liver. To our knowledge, this is also the first 
demonstration that human pathogen-specific MBC can localize 
within an infected organ. This finding has important implications 
background bait staining was seen among lymphocytes extracted 
from control HBV-negative liver samples (Figure 6F). As observed 
in the periphery, intrahepatic HBsAg-specific B cells were enriched 
for atMBC (Figure 6G).
These data show that atMBC preferentially accumulated in 
the liver niche and were further expanded in the presence of HBV 
infection, which drove upregulation of the inhibitory receptor 
PD-1. They demonstrate that virus-specific MBC can localize at 
the site of infection and pathology, allowing their phenotype and 
function to be shaped by the organ-specific milieu.
Discussion
Accumulating clinical evidence supports an important role for 
B cells in the immune control of HBV, mandating study of their 
defects in persistent infection that affects an estimated 290 mil￾lion people worldwide (50). The hallmark of naturally resolving 
HBV infection is the development of Abs directed against HBsAg, 
yet little is known about what limits their production in CHB. In

We focused initially on the potential role of PD-1 in con￾straining atMBC, as it was enriched on HBsAg-specific and 
intrahepatic atMBC, and PD-1 blockade is already being test￾ed in patients with CHB based on its capacity to boost antivi￾ral T cells (10). Multidimensional analysis showed that PD-1 
expression on B cells in CHB primarily clustered with the 
class-switched FcRL5+ atMBC fraction. High PD-1 expression 
on atMBC and on HBsAg-specific B cells was accompanied by 
increased intracellular levels of T-bet. T-bet has been suggested 
as defining a population of B cells with high antiviral potential 
(29, 31, 41–43), but also associates with the PD-1hi atypical dys￾functional phenotype in CHB, as in malaria, HCV, and HIV (28, 
29, 58, 62). These paradoxical findings are reminiscent of the 
complex role of PD-1 on T cells, associated with both activation 
and inhibition, limiting T cell function while also promoting 
long-term maintenance of immunosurveillance in the setting of 
chronic antigenic stimulation (40, 61, 63). Overall, they support 
T-bethiPD-1hiHBsAg-specific B cells being a favorable target for 
releasing from inhibition, since they should be transcriptionally 
wired for antiviral efficacy. Consistent with this, we were able 
to enhance the capacity of atMBC from patients with CHB to 
produce the antiviral B cell differentiation-promoting cytokine 
IL-6 with short-term PD-1 blockade and CD40L stimulation. 
Although the majority of studies have focused on PD-1 in T cells, 
several reports have shown that this receptor can also inhibit B 
cell signaling, survival, and functionality (34–36, 49, 64, 65). 
Of particular note, in vivo PD-1 blockade in macaques with SIV 
was able to enhance MBC proliferation and production of SIV 
envelope–specific Abs in parallel with T cell reconstitution (64). 
Indirect effects of PD-1 blockade on B cells via boosting of Tfh 
cannot be excluded in vivo, although previous work in mice has 
suggested PD-1 blockade actually inhibits germinal center Tfh 
interactions (66). A direct effect of PD-1 blockade on B cells was 
supported by further work from SIV-infected macaques showing 
preferential depletion of PD-1–expressing MBC in vivo and the 
susceptibility of PD-1hiCD21–
 actMBC to PD-L1–induced apop￾tosis in vitro (49). The latter finding is in keeping with our data 
showing that BCR-stimulated atMBC from patients with CHB 
underwent approximately 3-fold less apoptosis in the presence 
of PD-1 blockade.
Previous work has shown that B cell proliferation and cyto￾kine production can be boosted by siRNA knockdown of PD-1 
and a range of other inhibitory receptors expressed on atMBC 
from patients with HIV (34). The atMBC we identified in patients 
with CHB had significantly increased expression of a number of 
inhibitory receptors on their surface, as also noted in malaria (44); 
future studies will need to investigate their potential contribu￾tion to the impaired signaling and effector function we observed. 
Coligation of PD-1 and the BCR inhibits Ca2+ mobilization and 
tyrosine phosphorylation of several proximal BCR-signaling 
molecules, such as SYK (35), consistent with the impaired BCR￾dependent calcium flux and reduced phosphorylation of BLNK 
we observed in atMBC in CHB. Analogous impairments have 
been observed as a result of ligation of the inhibitory receptor 
FcRL5, another hallmark of atMBC (44, 67), which we found to 
be markedly upregulated on atMBC and HBsAg-specific B cells 
in CHB. FcRL5 binds the Fc of intact IgG (38, 39), raising the 
for their roles at the site of viral replication and disease pathology. 
First, it implies that it may be possible to boost intrahepatic plasma 
cells capable of producing anti-HBs Abs with neutralizing or other 
antiviral capacity. Local production of anti-HBs Abs would facili￾tate their binding to intrahepatic virions to block infection of new 
hepatocytes or to HBsAg on the hepatocyte membrane to promote 
elimination through ADCC. Work using a hepatoma cell line has 
suggested that hepatocytes may also be able to take up anti-HBs 
Abs through FcRn receptors that could then directly exert intra￾cellular antiviral effects (52). Furthermore, local production of 
antiviral cytokines by intrahepatic pathogen-specific B cells could 
optimize their delivery to infected hepatocytes. TNF-α, together 
with IFN-γ, plays a central role in the noncytolytic control of HBV 
replication and can degrade cccDNA (23, 26). Similarly, IL-6 has 
been shown to inhibit HBV at multiple steps of its life cycle, includ￾ing downregulating the entry receptor (27) and inhibiting tran￾scription and cccDNA acetylation (24, 25). IL-6 is also essential 
for maturation of activated B cells into immunoglobulin-produc￾ing cells (53), promoting T follicular helper cell (Tfh) generation 
for viral control in the late stages of infection (54). The reduced 
production of IL-6 and TNF-α that we documented by atMBC in 
CHB would therefore limit their direct antiviral activity and, com￾bined with their reduced expression of CD80, could impair pro￾ductive interactions with T cells. Future studies should investigate 
the potential for B cell–T cell crosstalk in the HBV-infected liver, 
since intrahepatic B cell follicles representing possible ectopic ger￾minal centers (55) and Tfh cells (56) have been observed in HCV￾infected livers.
Although intrahepatic HBV-specific B cells could favor local 
antiviral efficacy, the hostile liver environment would need to be 
overcome for their optimal functioning. Our finding of preferen￾tial accumulation of atMBC within the liver compared with the 
circulation suggests that the hepatic microenvironment may pro￾mote the development of this dysfunctional phenotype of MBC. 
This is consistent with previous findings pointing to the combi￾nation of BCR engagement, proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ), 
and TLR signals (TLR7/9), all features of the HBV-infected liver, 
as key factors driving T-bet and atMCB (29, 42, 57–60). B cells 
with downregulated CD21 and CD27 (atMBC) and upregulated 
PD-1, FcRL5, and CD11c expression were increased within the 
HBsAg-specific compartment in CHB compared with both their 
global B cell counterparts and with HBsAg-specific B cells in vac￾cinated controls. The enrichment of PD-1hiFcRL5hi atMBC within 
the HBsAg-specific pool, as previously described for gp140-
specific B cells in HIV, supports a central role for viral antigen 
driving their atypical phenotype through repetitive BCR engage￾ment (28, 31). Although atMBC were also present in non–HBV￾infected livers, they were more frequent in those infected with 
HBV and expressed more PD-1 in the latter group. These find￾ings, from ex vivo examination of B cells freshly isolated from a 
large number of human liver samples, therefore, support a com￾bined effect of the tolerogenic liver milieu and HBV viral antigen 
in driving the atypical and PD-1hi phenotype. This is analogous 
to our recent observations of PD-1 on CD8+
 T cells, which is also 
increased in the intrahepatic compared with circulating fraction, 
with expression further upregulated in HBV-infected compared 
with healthy livers (61).

to boost functional antiviral responses. The transcriptional, phe￾notypic, signaling, and functional features of the atMBC in CHB 
suggest they contain effectors with antiviral potential that have 
become defective in the setting of chronic antigenic stimulation 
and inflammation. Our demonstration that their premature apop￾tosis and impaired antiviral function can be partially rescued by 
PD-1 blockade with CD40L stimulation paves the way for future 
attempts to optimize their therapeutic reconstitution. Along these 
lines, Salimzadeh et al. show that addition of PD-1 blockade to 
CD40L stimulation rescues anti-HBs Ab production from HBsAg￾specific B cells sorted from 4 patients with CHB (69). PD-1 block￾ade is already being tested in the clinic for HBV and HBV-related 
HCC (10); it will be instructive to delineate whether there is any 
impact of this monotherapy on HBV-specific B cell frequencies 
and function in vivo.
Further studies will be needed to test additional stimuli 
bypassing the attenuated BCR pathway, compensating for inad￾equate Tfh help and/or blocking synergistic inhibitory receptors 
in order to optimize B cell recovery in CHB. The clinical applica￾tion of such approaches will require caution because of the poten￾tial for B cells, like T cells, to drive tissue damage in tandem with 
antiviral immunity. Therapeutic blockade of inhibitory receptors 
is likely to preferentially expand the T-bethiCD21–
CD27–
 subset 
of B cells, which is strongly implicated in autoimmunity (59). 
Pertinent to this concept, a recent report of melanoma patients 
treated with combination CTLA-4 and PD-1 blockade associated 
their risk of developing immune-related adverse events with the 
expansion of CD21lo B cells with a nonlymphoid tissue–hom￾ing profile (72). In CHB, an alternative to B cell boosting is the 
direct administration of therapeutic monoclonal Ab infusions, 
which has already been shown to achieve short-term reduc￾tions in HBsAg and HBV DNA (73, 74). Recently, an Ab able to 
optimize ADCP and indirectly boost T cells resulted in more sus￾tained effects in mouse models of HBV (73–75), underscoring the 
impact of effective humoral immunity. Future studies aiming for 
a functional cure of CHB should consider the induction of B as 
well as T cell immunity. Our data demonstrate that endogenous 
HBsAg-specific B cell responses can persist in the blood and liver 
of patients with CHB and start to identify targets for reconstitu￾tion of their multipronged antiviral efficacy.
Methods
Samples. Acute HBV infection was diagnosed on the basis of new 
HBsAg positivity or recent exposure and serological evolution; sam￾ples were considered from the acute phase when HBV DNA was still 
detectable and ALT was greater than 40 IU/l; samples were desig￾nated as resolved phase when HBV DNA and HBsAg were undetect￾able and ALT was normalized. All donors with CHB were stratified for 
disease stage (according to cutoffs listed in figure legends) by serum 
HBsAg (IU/ml, Abbott Architect Quantitate HBsAg) and HBeAg 
status, repeated measurements of viral load (IU/ml, determined by 
real-time PCR), and degree of liver inflammation by serum ALT. Par￾ticipants were anti–HCV and anti–HIV Ab negative unless otherwise 
stated; 6 controls with HCV were included, diagnosed by HCV sero￾positivity with RNA confirmation. All patients studied were treatment 
naive at the time of sampling. HC were either HBV unexposed, vac￾cinated with ENGERIX-B (GSK) during the study, or had anti-HBs 
possibility that circulating immune complexes crosslink FcRL5 
to the BCR, further suppressing B cell activation in a way simi￾lar to that of the inhibitory Fc receptor FcγRIIB (37). Therefore, 
it would be of interest to examine whether circulating HBsAg/
anti-HBs immune complexes, a well-recognized feature of CHB 
(16), further contribute to suppressing B cell function through the 
increased expression of FcRL5 and FcγRIIB.
Much remains to be understood regarding the complexity of 
B cell responses in HBV. The use of HBsAg baits for direct ex vivo 
quantification and phenotyping will facilitate further studies of B 
cell immunity in CHB, but has a number of caveats. As described 
for HLA/peptide multimer detection of HBV-specific T cells (68), 
HBsAg-specific B cells are often low frequency and can even 
approximate the background HBsAg bait stains seen in uninfected 
controls; however, background can be reduced by use of a dual￾staining HBsAg bait (69). Furthermore, circulating HBsAg-specif￾ic B cell frequencies, for example, after resolution of acute HBV, 
are unlikely to be representative of MBC compartmentalized 
within lymphoid tissue. It is also conceivable that HBsAg-specific 
B cells may be further underestimated if HBsAg bound to their 
BCR in vivo prevents bait staining in vitro or if the Ab-binding site 
on sAg in the bait differs from that produced in vivo.
There is clearly heterogeneity between, and even within, the 
2 atMBC subsets we identified. It will be important to investi￾gate whether the IgM-expressing fraction of atMBC in CHB can 
synthesize Abs with pathogenic potential, as previously ascribed 
to intrahepatic IgM+
anti-HBc Abs in HBV-associated acute liver 
failure (70). An accumulation of virus-specific B cells in the liver 
might also divert them away from the formation of long-lived 
plasma cells within the bone marrow, as suggested by the finding 
that rituximab, which spares the latter population, can result in 
reactivation of HBV (13). Another issue remaining to be addressed 
is that the inadequate Ab production by HBsAg-specific B cells 
cannot solely be attributed to the atMBC fraction expressing 
inhibitory receptors. There are likely additional, more general￾ized HBsAg-specific B cell defects related to the high-dose anti￾gen and, in particular, to inadequate T cell help, consistent with 
a recent report of impaired HBsAg-specific Tfh function in HBV 
(71). Future studies could analyze HBsAg-specific B cells and Tfh 
in parallel to better define the influence of defective T cell help on 
B cell functionality. In addition, the availability of robust assays 
for quantitating and/or dissociating circulating HBsAg/Ab com￾plexes would allow a better assessment of the influence of anti￾gen load on HBsAg-specific B cell frequencies and Ab detection. 
However, the capacity of the large quantities of HBsAg in viral and 
subviral particles to drive B cell exhaustion and the extent to which 
subviral particles serve as a decoy for existing Abs (18) may soon 
be clarified by trials of novel therapies aiming to reduce HBsAg’s 
production or release (10).
In summary, our data show that HBV infection imprints major 
changes on the B cell compartments in both the periphery and 
liver. atMBC are expanded in global and HBsAg-specific B cells in 
CHB, are enriched in the liver, and express more inhibitory recep￾tors such as PD-1 than their counterparts in uninfected controls. 
We show that many donors with CHB lacking detectable anti-HBs 
Ab associated with infection resolution do maintain MBC of this 
specificity in their circulation and liver, revealing the opportunity

(Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C. Cytokine responses were analyzed by intra￾cellular cytokine staining for IL-6 and TNF-α along with cell-surface 
staining to identify MBC populations.
For analysis of apoptosis, 2 × 105
 B cells were purified by magnetic 
separation according to the manufacturer’s instructions (B Cell Enrich￾ment Kit, STEMCELL Technologies) and stimulated for 7 days with 1 
μg/ml F(ab′)2
 IgM- and IgG-specific Abs plus 500 ng/ml MEGACD40L. 
Cells were then stained for B cell phenotype, followed by incubation 
with annexin V–PerCP/Cy5.5 in the presence of annexin V–binding buf￾fer according to the manufacturer’s instructions (BioLegend).
Phosphoflow. PBMCs were surface stained as above to identify 
MBC subsets. Cells were washed prior to stimulation with 20 μg/ml 
F(ab′)2
 IgM-, IgA-, and IgG-specific Abs (Jackson ImmunoResearch) 
for 30 seconds. Cells were immediately fixed in prewarmed Cytofix 
(BD Biosciences) and left at 37°C for 10 minutes. Cells were then pel￾leted and resuspended in Phosflow Buffer (BD Biosciences) for 30 
minutes at –20°C. Cells were stained for phosphorylated BLNK (rabbit 
monoclonal; Cell Signaling Technologies; catalog 3601S) for 30 min￾utes at 4°C. Ab was then washed off before incubation with PE sec￾ondary (Life Technologies) for a further 30 minutes at 4°C. Cells were 
washed and analyzed on Fortessa-X20 (BD Biosciences).
Calcium flux. B cells were separated through magnetic separa￾tion according to the manufacturer’s instructions (B Cell Enrichment 
Kit) and stained for B cell memory phenotype, as before. Cells were 
washed in PBS and incubated with 1 μM Fluo-4 AM Dye (Thermo Fish￾er) for 30 minutes at 37°C. Fluo-4 AM was diluted in RPMI containing 
250 mM probenecid (Thermo Fisher). Cells were then washed in PBS 
and rested in the dark at room temperature (RT) for 20 minutes before 
analysis. 5 × 105
 Cells were analyzed for 20 seconds on a FORTESSA 
X20 (BD Biosciences) to establish baseline prior to stimulation with 
anti-IgM/IgG/IgA (50 μg/ml) or ionomycin (1 μg/ml), after which 
they were analyzed for a further 150 seconds.
Differentiation of plasma cells. PBMCs were stained as above and 
sorted into atMBC and cMBC populations using a FACSAria (BD 
Biosciences). Stringent criteria were applied to identify lympho￾cytes, based on forward scatter (FSC) versus side scatter (SSC), and 
to remove doublet contamination. CD10+
 immature B cells were 
excluded. Between 5 × 104 and 2 × 105
 atMBC were purified using this 
method; in all cases, a matched number of cMBC were sorted and 
stimulated as below.
Cells were first activated for 4 days in a 96-well plate using CpG-B (50 
ng/ml; TLR9 agonist; ODN-2009; Invivogen) and HBsAg (Roche; ayw, 
10 μg/ml) in combination with IL-2 (50 U/ml), IL-10 (50 ng/ml), IL-15 
(10 ng/ml), and IL-21 (100 ng/ml), diluted in DMEM (plus 10% FBS, 1% 
penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% nonessential amino acids). Cells were 
then switched into DMEM containing IL-2, IL-10, IL-15 (concentrations 
as above), IL-6 (50 ng/ml), and INF-α (500 U/ml) for a further 3 days 
to promote their differentiation into Ab-secreting cells. After culture, 
cells were stained for plasma cell differentiation using BUV805-CD45, 
BV786-CD19, PE-Cy7-IgD, BUV395-CD27, PE-dazzle-CD38, AF700-
CD20, BV711-CD3, and APC-CD138 and analyzed on a Fortessa X20.
Abs of more than 100 IU/ml following prior vaccination. HC ranged 
between 21 and 89 years of age; CHB patients ranged between 23 and 
71 years of age.
Preparation of PMBC and intrahepatic lymphocytes. PBMCs were 
isolated from heparinized blood by density centrifugation using Ficoll￾Hypaque Plus (GE Healthcare). PBMCs were either used immediately 
or frozen in FBS (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% DMS0 
(Sigma-Aldrich). Intrahepatic lymphocytes (IHL) from CHB liver 
biopsies were isolated by mechanical disruption without further pro￾cessing (debris removed by filtration through 70 μM cell strainers; BD 
Biosciences). To isolate IHL from perfusate samples, liquid was first 
concentrated by centrifugation. Concentrated cells were resuspended 
in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and IHL 
isolated by density centrifugation (400 g) using Ficoll-Hypaque Plus. 
For larger explants/resections, tissue was cut into small pieces and 
incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes in 0.01% collagenase IV (Life Tech￾nologies) and 0.001% DNaseI (Sigma-Aldrich). Mechanical diges￾tion was performed using a GentleMACS (Miltenyi Biotec) and debris 
removed by filtration. Parenchymal cells were removed by centrifuga￾tion (400 g) on a 30% Percoll gradient (GE Healthcare) and IHLs then 
isolated by density centrifugation (400 g) using Ficoll-Hypaque Plus.
Flow cytometry for B cell subset phenotype and function. Multipa￾rametric flow cytometry was used for ex vivo analysis of B cells. For 
subset gating, combinations of the following mAbs were used: CD19-
BV786, CD27-BUV395, CD20–Alexa Fluor 700, CD10-BV605, CD3-
BV711, CD21-BV421, and CD45-BUV05. Full details of mAbs used, 
including those used for phenotypic characterization, are given in 
Supplemental Table 1.
Cells were stained with Fixable LIVE/DEAD Dye (Life Technolo￾gies, Thermo Fisher Scientific) before incubation with saturating con￾centrations of surface mAbs diluted in 50% Brilliant Violet Buffer (BD 
Biosciences) and 50% PBS for 30 minutes at 4°C. In all instances, cells 
were stained in the presence of FcR-blocking reagent (Miltenyi Biotec). 
Cells were fixed and permeabilized for further functional assessment 
with either Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences) or FoxP3 Buffer Set (BD 
Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions for intracel￾lular or intranculear staining respectively. Saturating concentrations 
of mAbs for 30 minutes at 4°C were diluted in 0.1% saponin (Sigma￾Aldrich) for the detection of intracellular proteins or in 1× PBS for the 
detection of intranuclear proteins. All samples were acquired on a Fort￾essa-X20 (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo (Tree Star).
Identification of HBsAg-specific B cells. For identification of HBsAg￾specific B cells, 1 × 106 cells were stained with an FITC-conjugated 
recombinant HBsAg, ayw strain (Roche). All staining was performed 
in parallel with mAb staining, as above, by incubating cells for 30 min￾utes at 4°C. Stringent gating criteria were applied with doublet, dead, 
and CD19-negative cell exclusion to minimize nonspecific binding 
contamination. Cells stained with an identical panel minus HBsAg 
bait (fluorescence minus one [FMO]) were used to control for nonspe￾cific binding, with corresponding FMO frequencies subtracted. The 
phenotype of HBsAg-specific B cells was not analyzed in instances in 
which there were fewer than 50 HBsAg bait+
 cells recorded.
B cell stimulation. To assess cytokine production, 2 × 105
 PBMCs 
were stimulated with either 10 μg/ml F(ab′)2
 IgM- and IgG-specific 
Abs (Southern Biotech and Jackson ImmunoResearch, respectively) 
in combination with 0.5 μg/ml MEGACD40L (Enzo Life Sciences) or 
1 μg/ml R848 (TLR7/8 agonist; Invivogen) diluted in complete RPMI

ELISpot. ELISpot plates (multiscreen HTS-IP, 0.45 μm, Merck Milli￾pore) were precoated with HBsAg (2 μg/ml) or anti-human IgG/A/M (1 
μg/ml) for detection of total Ab-secreting cells and blocked with RPMI 
with 1% milk. For ELISpot analysis of HBsAg-specific MBC, B cells were 
purified from frozen PBMC samples using magnetic separation (B Cell 
Enrichment Kit). B cells were activated and stimulated as above. 2 × 105
Cells were added to the plate and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2
 for 18 
hours. Cells were then washed 3 times with PBS–Tween 20 (0.05%), 
followed by PBS. Goat anti-human IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Jack￾son ImmunoResearch Laboratories; diluted 1/800 in PBS–10% FBS) 
was added and incubated for 4 hours at RT in the dark. Cells were again 
washed 3 times with PBS–Tween 20 (0.05%) and 3 times with PBS, then 
developed with AEC substrate (BD Biosciences), according to the man￾ufacturer’s instructions. ELISpot plates were then washed with ddH2
0 
before analysis using virusSPOT (Autoimmun Diagnostika). All assays 
were performed in triplicate.
Detection of anti-HBs. For detection of anti-HBs, HBsAg-specific B 
cells were sorted and stimulated for 7 days as above. Number of cells 
isolated ranged from between 3 × 103
 and 2 × 104
. Culture supernatants 
were sent for anti-HBs quantification (Health Services Laboratory, Uni￾versity College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Abbott Archi￾tect anti-HBs). Samples were also tested in parallel in-house using the 
anti-HBs CLIA Kit (Autobio) per the manufacturer’s instructions.
tSNE. tSNE analysis was performed on concatenated flow cytom￾etry data from 10 patients with CHB and 10 HC using default param￾eters (iterations, 1,000; perplexity, 20; and θ, 0.5). tSNE was applied 
to expression data for CD27, CD21, PD-1, FcRL5, CD24, CD38, IgM, 
and IgD for all live CD45+
CD19+
CD3–
CD20–
CD10–
 events.
