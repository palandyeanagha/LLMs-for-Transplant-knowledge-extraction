Budd-Chiari Syndrome 603
cular therapy, effectively resolved a large IVC thrombus in 
a patient with BCS.1,2 BCS is an uncommon condition 
caused by thrombotic or non-thrombotic obstruction of 
the hepatic venous outflow tract. Clinical features of the 
syndrome include hepatomegaly, ascites, and abdominal 
pain. Treatment of BCS is most successful when the disorder 
is diagnosed early.3 Treatment can include surgical inter￾vention (shunting) or angioplasty with balloon dilatation 
alone or with stent placement. In severe cases, liver trans￾plantation may be necessary. This strategy has a 5-year 
survival rate approaching 90%.4 Although there have been 
no reports of bleeding-related deaths in BCS on anticoagu￾lation, few studies have investigated this issue. A recent 
study reported a high rate of anticoagulation-related com￾plications in patients undergoing transhepatic interven￾tional therapy. A surprisingly high rate of heparin-induced 
thrombocytopenia was observed, primarily with unfrac￾tionated heparin. Little is known about the optimal level 
of anticoagulation in BCS,5 and no previous studies have 
investigated the usefulness of DOAC before endovascular 
therapy in this patient population. In the present case, the 
IVC thrombosis completely resolved with the use of 
DOAC alone, leading to a successful vascular intervention 
without embolic complications in a patient with BCS.

A49-year-old man presented with abdominal dis￾tension and shortness of breath. On admission, 
pulse rate was 55beats/min, blood pressure was 
126/90mmHg and body temperature was 36.7°C. He was 
conscious and alert. The bulbar conjunctiva were non￾icteric, and the palpebral conjunctiva were not pale. No 
respiratory rales or heart murmurs were noted on ausculta￾tion; but mild, bilateral, pitting pedal edema was observed. 
The abdomen was distended with dilated collateral veins 
over the anterior abdominal wall (caput medusae; Figure A). 
Palpation of the abdomen indicated splenomegaly.
Laboratory tests indicated mild thrombocytopenia 
(12.4×104/μL; normal, >15×104/μL), elevated total bilirubin 
(1.8mg/dL; normal, <1.2mg/dL), elevated NH3 (84μg/dL; 
normal, <70μg/dL), mildly elevated hepatic enzymes (serum 
glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, 37 U/L; glutamic pyruvic 
transaminase, 27 U/L), mildly elevated biliary enzyme 
(serum alkaline phosphatase, 508 IU/L; normal, 106–322 
IU/L), markedly elevated γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (368 
IU/L; normal, 13–64 IU/L) and prolonged prothrombin 
time with an international normalized ratio of 1.57. Ultra￾sonography and enhanced computed tomography (CT) 
showed a membrane-like complete obstruction of the infe￾rior vena cava (IVC) at the suprahepatic level, and a large, 
free-floating thrombus in the IVC (Figure B). The patient 
had a history of treatment-refractory esophageal varices 
due to cirrhosis of the liver.
We diagnosed this patient as having Budd-Chiari syn￾drome (BCS) with a large free-floating thrombus in the 
IVC. The severity was grade III based on the Japanese 
guidelines.
The patient received direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) 
therapy for 3 months (ELIQUIS® (apixaban), at a dose of 
5mg twice daily). Follow-up imaging showed complete 
resolution of the IVC thrombus. Percutaneous transluminal 
balloon angioplasty (PTBA) was performed 3 months after 
initiation of DOAC (Figure C). The guidewire was inserted 
into the right atrium through the radiofrequency needle 
(Japan Lifeline) under intracardiac echocardiographic 
guidance, followed by successful double balloon dilatation 
without flow-limiting or embolic complications (Figure D). 
DOAC were continued for an additional 3 months. 
To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that 
DOAC can produce favorable results in BCS. Three 
months of DOAC therapy, both before and after endovas-
