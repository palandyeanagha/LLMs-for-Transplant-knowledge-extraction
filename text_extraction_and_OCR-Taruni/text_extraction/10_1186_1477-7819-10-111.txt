Abstract
Background: Standard treatment for metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) is systemic therapy with
imatinib. Surgery is performed to remove metastatic lesions to induce long-term remission or even curation. In
other patients, surgery is performed to remove (focal) progressive or symptomatic lesions. The impact and long￾term results of surgery after systemic therapy have not been clearly defined.
Methods: Between September 2001 and May 2010, all patients with metastatic GIST who underwent surgery for
metastatic GIST after systemic therapy (that is, imatinib and sunitinib) at four Dutch specialized institutions were
included. Primary end-points were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
Results: All 55 patients underwent surgery after treatment with systemic therapy. At the last follow-up, tumor
recurrence or progression was noted after surgery in 48% of the patients who responded on systemic therapy, and
in 85% of the patients who were treated while having progressive disease. Median PFS and OS were not reached in
the group of responders. In the non-responders group PFS and OS were median 4 and 25 months, respectively.
Response on systemic therapy and a surgical complete resection were significantly correlated to PFS and OS.
Conclusions: Surgery may play a role in responding patients. In patients with progressive disease, the role of
surgery is more difficult to distinguish in this retrospective analysis since PFS is short. Which patients benefit and
whether this improves long-term outcome should be established in a multicentric randomized trial.

Background
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most
common sarcoma of the gastrointestinal tract, accoun￾ting for <1% of all malignancies of the gastrointestinal
tract [1,2]. Tumor size, perioperative tumor rupture and
incomplete resection are factors known to influence de￾velopment of metastases after surgery [3-5]. Metastases
are mainly located in the liver and intraperitoneum [6].
Conventional chemotherapy has been ineffective in
treating metastasized GIST with disappointing response
rates below 10% [7].
Up to 85% of GISTs have activating mutations in tyro￾sine kinase receptor (KIT) and platelet-derived growth
factor receptor alpha (PDFRA) genes, which are respon￾sible for tumor development [8,9]. Imatinib, a selective
inhibitor of several tyrosine kinases (for example, c-KIT
and PDGFRA), has provided a generally safe and well￾tolerated first-line therapy for patients with primary
unresectable and metastatic GIST. Stable disease or
tumor shrinkage is achieved in the majority of these
patients [7,10,11]. Although most patients initially bene￾fit from imatinib, its response is not maintained indefin￾itely as resistance commonly develops with a median
time to progression of 18 to 24 months. After 5 years,
most patients develop progressive disease which indi￾cates that almost all patients will acquire resistance to
imatinib [7,12,13]. Sunitinib, another oral multitarget

tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has proven to be efficacious in
patients intolerant or refractory to imatinib [14]. As a
consequence of the introduction of effective systemic
therapy (that is, imatinib and sunitinib), the median sur￾vival for metastatic GIST patients has substantially
improved and is currently 5 years or more [15].
Prior to the introduction of systemic therapy, surgery
was frequently applied. Outcomes were poor with a me￾dian survival of approximately 10 to 20 months and a 5-
year survival of <10% for patients with metastasized
GIST [3,16-18]. After the introduction of imatinib and
sunitinib, surgery is now sometimes applied in patients
with metastasized GIST. In patients who respond well to
systemic therapy, the rationale for combining it with sur￾gery is that by reducing tumor load, the risk of resistance
to systemic therapy may be lowered. Observations from
the phase III study comparing imatinib, 400 versus 800
mg daily, supports this approach to resect residual dis￾ease in an attempt to postpone secondary resistance
[19]. Surgery is also applied in case of symptomatic or
single progressive lesions. Others have already reported
long-term progression-free survival (PFS) and overall
survival (OS) after surgery in patients with metastatic
GIST treated with imatinib [20-25]. This study aims to
retrospectively describe the feasibility and outcome of
surgery in a relatively large group of patients with meta￾static GIST who underwent surgery after systemic
therapy.
Methods
Patients and preoperative treatment
All patients in this study were referred to four Dutch
institutions (The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amster￾dam; Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden; Rad￾boud University Nijmegen Medical Center, Nijmegen;
Daniel Den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam) for treat￾ment of metastatic GIST between September 2001 and
August 2011. Each patient was evaluated in a multidis￾ciplinary tumor board before the start of treatment with
imatinib. All patients had a previous histopathologically
confirmed diagnosis of GIST. Patient-, tumor- and
treatment-specific data were extracted from sarcoma
databases, medical records and patient charts at each in￾stitution. Recorded data included initial presentation,
diagnosis, details of operations for primary and/or meta￾static disease prior to systemic therapy, date of start of
systemic therapy, duration and dose of systemic therapy,
complications on systemic therapy, response to systemic
therapy at time of surgery, date of surgery, type of sur￾gery, completeness of resection, postoperative complica￾tions, postoperative systemic therapy, recurrence after
surgery, last follow-up and disease status at last follow￾up and, if applicable, date of death.
Before the start of imatinib, all patients had a baseline
computerized tomography (CT) scan, and patients were
clinically and radiographically re-evaluated every 1 to 6
months until surgery. Response to systemic therapy was
classified as a complete response (CR), a partial response
(PR), stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD)
according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST) [26]. For the purpose of analysis,
patients were subdivided into two groups depending on
their response on systemic therapy at the time of sur￾gery. The responders group comprised patients with CR,
PR and SD, and the non-responders group comprised
patients with PD.
Surgery and postoperative treatment
Surgical procedures were performed at all four institu￾tions after a patient tailor-made decision was made in
multidisciplinary tumor boards. The results of surgery
were recorded as macroscopically complete (R0), macro￾scopically complete with positive microscopic margins
(R1) or macroscopically incomplete (R2), based on surgi￾cal and pathological evaluation. Patients restarted sys￾temic therapy depending on completeness of resection
and preference of the treating physicians. Status of dis￾ease at last follow-up was determined using the most re￾cent clinical evaluation. If a patient had deceased, date
of death and disease status at death was recorded.
Endpoints and statistics
PFS and OS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier
method. PFS was defined as the time from date of sur￾gery after systemic therapy to date of first documented
progression of residual disease, recurrent disease, meta￾static disease or death from any cause. OS was defined
as the time from date of surgery after systemic therapy
to date of death from any cause. Statistical analysis was
performed using SPSS statistical software, version 18.0
(IBM SPSS Software, New York, United States).
Results
Patients and preoperative treatment
Between September 2001 and May 2010, 55 patients with
metastatic GIST underwent surgery after systemic ther￾apy. Follow-up data was available until August 2011. Me￾dian age was 54 (range 18 to 77) years at diagnosis of
metastatic GIST and 57 (range 20 to 80) years at time of
surgery after systemic therapy. All patients had a GIST
confirmed by experienced sarcoma pathologists at the four
centers, and 52 patients (95%) were characterized by a
positive c-KIT expression. Mutation status was available
in 33 patients (60%); in 22 patients (40%) it was not rou￾tinely performed. Details on GIST manifestation are
shown in Table 1. Thirty-one patients underwent one to

three operations for primary or metastatic GIST before
the start of systemic therapy for metastasized GIST.
All patients initially received imatinib in a 400 mg daily
dose. Twenty patients experienced complications on ima￾tinib and one patient temporarily interrupted treatment
because of gastrointestinal complications. Seventeen
patients experienced PD from the start and imatinib was
doubled to 800 mg daily. Eleven of these seventeen
patients again experienced PD and switched to sunitinib
50 mg daily for 2 weeks followed by 1 week off-drug or a
37.5 mg daily continuous scheme. Five patients experi￾enced complications on sunitinib: four patients experi￾enced neurological and hematological complications, and
sunitinib was lowered to a 37.5 mg daily continuous dose;
one patient experienced complications and PD on suniti￾nib as well and switched back to imatinib 800 mg daily.
All 55 patients underwent surgery after a median of 16
(range 3 to 72) months of systemic therapy. Systemic ther￾apy was continued in all patients until surgery.
Surgical outcomes and postoperative treatment
In the responders group (n = 35), 2 patients had a CR, 25
patients had a PR and eight patients had SD before
surgery was performed after a median of 14 (range 3 to
72) months of systemic therapy. In the non-responders
group (n = 20), 13 patients initially experienced PR or
SD on systemic therapy before PD became apparent,
and 7 patients experienced PD from the start. Surgery
was performed after a median of 22 (range 5 to 72)
months in this group.
Forty-five patients on imatinib underwent surgery and
ten patients on sunitinib underwent surgery. Most surgi￾cal procedures were multivisceral resections (Table 2),
and no tumor rupture occurred during surgery. A R0 re￾section was possible in 20 (57%) and 9 (45%) patients in
the responders group and non-responders group, re￾spectively. One patient in the responders group under￾went a R0 resection of the left vastus medialis muscle
because of an unusual metastasis at this location. Thir￾teen patients (37%) in the responders group and six
patients (30%) in the non-responders group underwent a
R1 resection. A R2 resection was performed in two
patients in the responders group (6%), and in five
patients (25%) in the non-responders group. In six of
these patients, surgery could not be completed because
of perioperative findings (that is, unresectable tumor).
Of these six surgical interventions, one patient also had
significant bleeding forcing the surgeon to terminate the
surgical procedure. One patient underwent an emer￾gency operation because of a bowel perforation and
showed an unresectable tumor during surgery. The

perforation was closed and a colostomy was performed.
Surgical complications occurred in 11 patients. Four
patients required a reoperation: for postoperative bleed￾ing (n = 2), bile leakage (n = 1), and fascial dehiscence
(n = 1). No patient died within 30 days of surgery. Sys￾temic therapy was restarted after surgery in 27 patients
(77%) in the responders group and in 19 patients (95%)
in the non-responders group depending on expert opin￾ion (that is, tumor board decision), remaining disease
and resection type.
Progression-free and overall survival
Complete follow-up data were available for 53 patients,
with a median postoperative follow-up time of 41 (range
2 to 97) months. Two patients were lost to follow-up be￾cause they moved to another country. Tumor recurrence
or progression after surgery was noted in 16 patients
(48%) in the responders group and in 17 patients (85%)
in the non-responders group. Disease-related death oc￾curred in 9 patients (28%) in the responders group and
in 14 patients (70%) in the non-responders group.
PFS and OS from time of surgery for both groups are
shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. Median PFS has not
been reached in the responders group; in the non￾responders group PFS was 4 (range 1to 27) months.
One-, three- and five-year PFS was 85%, 55%, and 55%.
For the non-responders group, the 1-, 3- and 5-year PFS
was 22%, 13%, and 0%. Median OS has not been reached
in the responders group; in the non-responders group
OS was 25 (range 3 to 58) months. In the responders
group, the 1-, 3- and 5-year OS was 100%, 78%, and
78%. In the non-responders group, the 1-, 3- and 5-year
OS was 65%, 26% and 0%.
Univariate analysis (Table 3) of patient demographic,
tumor, and treatment variables demonstrated response
on systemic therapy and complete resection as prognos￾tic factors correlating with PFS and OS. Patients
responding to systemic therapy (that is, CR, PR or SD)
at the time of surgery had a better outcome in terms of
PFS and OS. The magnitude of this association is rather
large with hazard ratios of 7.95 and 11.45. A complete
resection was associated with a better PFS. Multivariate
analysis yielded no significant outcomes due to relatively
small numbers of patients in each cohort.
Discussion
In this study, we analyzed the feasibility and outcome of
a large group of patients with metastatic GIST who
underwent surgical resection after neoadjuvant treat￾ment with imatinib and/or sunitinib. Surgery was per￾formed to remove metastatic lesions to induce long￾term remission or even curation in selected patients with
an excellent response after systemic therapy, while in
other patients surgery was performed to remove (focal)
progressive symptomatic lesions.
Imatinib as the first-line systemic treatment in patients
with metastatic GIST induces regression or stabilization
in over 80% of patients, and sunitinib can achieve
responses in patients refractory to imatinib [11,14]. A
complete response or sustained ongoing response on
systemic therapy is rarely seen, and discontinuation of
systemic therapy usually leads to recurrence or rapid
progression of disease [27]. This knowledge supports
continuing systemic therapy in patients with responsive
or stable tumor clones [13,28]. Nearly one-third of the
patients in this study experienced PD while on systemic
therapy. In at least some of these patients, it can be
explained by the imatinib refractory mutation (that is,
KIT exon 9 mutation) or the heterogeneous nature of
GIST itself. Response measurement in GIST by using
RECIST alone, however, might not be the best available
tool. Assessment of the response using density and/or

smaller changes in size are more precise and likely to
yield information on the response more quickly [29,30]
can be useful when CT findings are inconsistent with
clinical findings [31-33]. However, a 18FDG-PET scan
was not always available in the past in this study.
In the pre-imatinib era, median survival was 19
months for metastatic disease and 12 months for local
recurrence [17]. Median survival for metastatic GIST
patients treated with imatinib has improved to 5 years
or more [12,15]. Prolonged PFS and OS rates observed
after imatinib therapy in patients with metastatic GIST
have been the topic of investigation on the effect of sur￾gery following systemic therapy. Several retrospective
studies have already reported a favorable outcome for
patients responding to systemic therapy undergoing sur￾gery following imatinib therapy (Table 4). In this series,
it is not possible to dissect the specific contribution of
surgery to the survival rates given the lack of an appro￾priate control group. A phase III trial was conducted to
randomize patients with metastatic GIST responsive to
imatinib to either continue imatinib alone or imatinib
plus early surgery. Unfortunately, this trial was stopped
due to lack of accrual. Evidence should therefore be col￾lected using multicenter cohort analyzes such as the
present study.
The present study demonstrates a clear improvement
in PFS and OS when surgery is performed in patients
with responsive disease on systemic therapy and a
complete resection is related to an improved PFS. This
is in accordance with other reports (Table 4). The sur￾vival rates of patients in the non-responders group are
comparable to historical data of surgically treated
patients before the introduction of c-KIT targeting
agents [3,17]. Evidence from randomized clinical trials is
lacking, and it has therefore been difficult to determine
the duration of systemic therapy before surgery. Some
patients were thus operated on when progression of dis￾ease on systemic therapy became apparent. This is
reflected in both the duration of treatment before sur￾gery and the short PFS in the non-responders group.
Given the relatively limited survival after surgery in
patients with progressive disease at the time of surgery,
we do not recommend surgery in these patients unless
there is an urgent indication (for example, bleeding or
obstruction).
In general, surgery after systemic therapy of advanced
GIST appeared to be feasible and is not associated with
enhanced morbidity compared to patients undergoing
surgery alone for GIST. The reported number of incom￾plete (R1/R2) resections in this study is high, which has
been observed by others. This reflects the extensiveness
of the disease and the need to carefully choose between
potential treatment options in patients with metastatic
GIST.
Conclusions
In our experience, patients with recurrent and/or meta￾static GIST should be referred to centers with significant

experience in surgery of these patients. Evaluation in a
multidisciplinary sarcoma tumor board provides the op￾timal strategy for medical and/or surgical treatment in
multicenter trials. The results of this study indicate that
surgery may have an important role in responding
patients. In patients with progressive disease, the role of
surgery is more difficult to discern from this retrospect￾ive analysis since PFS is short and surgery is probably
only beneficial in symptomatic patients in good clinical
condition.
