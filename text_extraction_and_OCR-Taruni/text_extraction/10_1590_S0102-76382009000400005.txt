Azul de metileno no tratamento da síndrome vasoplégica em cirurgia cardíaca. Quinze anos de
perguntas, respostas, dúvidas e certezas
Methylene blue for vasoplegic syndrome treatment
in heart surgery. Fifteen years of questions,
answers, doubts and certainties
Abstract
Objective: There is strong evidence that methylene blue
(MB), an inhibitor of guanylate cyclase, is an excellent
therapeutic option for vasoplegic syndrome (VS) treatment
in heart surgery. The aim of this article is to review the MB’s
therapeutic function in the vasoplegic syndrome treatment.
Methods: Fifteen years of literature review.
Results: 1) Heparin and ACE inhibitors are risk factors; 2)
In the recommended doses it is safe (the lethal dose is 40 mg/
kg); 3) The use of MB does not cause endothelial dysfunction;
4) The MB effect appears in cases of nitric oxide (NO) up￾regulation; 5) MB is not a vasoconstrictor, by blocking of the
GMPc system it releases the AMPc system, facilitating the
norepinephrine vasoconstrictor effect; 6) The most used
dosage is 2 mg/kg as IV bolus followed by the same continuous
infusion because plasmatic concentrations strongly decays
in the first 40 minutes; 7) There is a possible “window of
opportunity” for the MB’s effectiveness.
Conclusions: Although there are no definitive multicentric
studies, the MB used to treat heart surgery VS, at the present
time, is the best, safest and cheapest option, being a Brazilian
contribution for the heart surgery.

surgery, with emphasis on what we have learned on “fifteen
years of questions, answers, doubts and certainties”. To
help readers, the abbreviations used are: AMPc = cyclic
adenosine monophosphate; CPB = cardiopulmonary
bypass; ecNOS = endothelial constitutive nitric oxide
synthase; GMPc = cyclic guanosine monophosphate; iNOS
= inducible nitric oxide synthase; MB = methylene blue;
MDA – malondialdyde; NO = nitric oxide; NOS = nitric oxide
synthase; VS = vasoplegic syndrome.
METHODS
A wide literature review, and the author´s documented
observations over a period of 15 years, was performed using
the data collected from the two most important databases in
the medical area: MEDLINE and SCOPUS. The following
combinations of keywords were adopted: 1) “Methylene
blue and heart surgery”; 2) “Methylene blue and cardiac
surgery”; 3) “Methylene blue and cardiopulmonary bypass”
and; “Methylene blue and vasoplegic syndrome”. This
combination of MB with rather generic keywords was
proposital in the sense of captivating an amplified subject
vision.
In addition to the bibliographical data, some capital
questions where ellected in the attempt to consolidate the
most important aspects of the MB use in VS treatment
associated with cardiac surgery: 1) What medications would
be listed as VS risk factor in cardiac surgery?; 2) Could the
systemic inflammatory reaction be caused by blood exposure
to the non-endothelized CPB circuit? 3) Is the in vivo MB
use safe? 4) What kind of MB use complications are
possible? 5) Does the use of MB cause endothelium
dysfunction? 6) Does the MB injection cause any
hemodynamic effect in non vasoplegic patients? 7) Does
MB have proper pressoric effect? 8) Does a therapeutic
INTRODUCTION
As a historical review, three facts specifically mark the
vasoplegic syndrome (VS) as a Brazilian contribution to heart
surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB): a) Its
description by Gomes et al. [1-3], in 1994; b) The proposal,
also in 1994, that vasoplegia´s phisiopathology was cyclic
GMP-dependent and methylene blue (MB) as its treatment
[4] and; c) The first documentation of this therapeutic
proposal´s efficiency in patients undergone heart surgery
presented by Andrade et al. [5], in 1996, at the Brazilian
Society of Cardiovascular Surgery Congress.
Although MB has been used for over 15 years in the
treatment of VS, few are the quality clinical studies that
permit the treatment to become a protocol. Three studies
involving a higher number of patients deserve particular
citations: 1) In 2003, Leyh et al. [6,7] reported, in Germany,
54 cases of cardiac surgery patients not carrying bacterial
endocarditis who had been treated with MB, with over 90%
of the patients responding to the treatment; 2) Levin et al.
[8-10], in Argentina, reported the incidence of 8.8% of VS in
638 patients. Among the 56 vasoplegic patients randomly
receiving MB or placebo there was no mortality in the group
treated with MB and it was possible to discontinue
vasoconstrictors in a short period time, with less
consequential morbidity and mortality.
Whereas, in the placebo group two deaths occurred and
the use of amines lasted in average 48 hours, with higher
incidence of respiratory and renal problems; 3) From the
prevention point of view, Ozal et al. [11], in Turkey, showed
in a prospective and randomized study that MB was
associated to a minor incidence of vasoplegia and amines
use.
As emphasized in the title, the aim of the present study
is to review the MB role in the treatment of VS in heart
Resumo
Objetivo: Existem fortes evidências de que o azul de
metileno (AM), um inibidor da guanilato ciclase, é uma
excelente opção terapêutica para o tratamento da
síndrome vasoplégica (SV) em cirurgia cardíaca. O
objetivo deste artigo é rever o papel terapêutico do AM no
tratamento da SV.
Métodos: Revisão da literatura em período de 15 anos.
Resultados: 1) A heparina e inibidores da ECA são fatores
de risco; 2) Nas doses preconizadas é droga segura (a dose
letal é de 40 mg/kg); 3) O AM não causa disfunção endotelial;
4) O efeito do AM só aparece em caso de supra-regulação de
óxido nítrico (NO); 5) O AM não é um vasoconstritor, pelo
bloqueio do sistema GMPc ele “libera” o sistema AMPc,
facilitando o efeito vasoconstritor da noradrenalina; 6) A
dosagem mais utilizada é 2 mg/kg em bolus endovenosa,
seguida de infusão contínua, pois a concentração plasmática
decai acentuadamente nos primeiros 40 minutos; 7) Existe
possível “janela de oportunidade” para efetividade do AM.
Conclusão: Embora não existam estudos multicêntricos
definitivos, a utilização do AM no tratamento da SV em
cirurgia cardíaca é, na atualidade, a melhor, mais segura e
barata opção, sendo contribuição brasileira.

dosage scheme exist? 9) Why does VS sometimes is
promptly reverted with MB infusion, and sometimes it does
not seem to work? 10) Are there any circulatory shock
modalities, beyond sepsis and VS, that can be benefited by
MB? 11) Do worthwhile investigations related to MB use in
cardiac surgery exist?
RESULTS
The bibliographical survey on the MB therapeutic use,
based on databases MEDLINE and SCOPUS searches,
revealed a total of 58 publications directly related to the VS
in cardiac surgery (Figure 1).
Between 40 specific studies on VS and MB, 20 (33.93%)
are Brazilian articles; eight (13.33%) are American articles;
eight (13.33%) are German articles; three (5%) are
Argentinean articles; three (5%) are Spanish articles; three
(5%) are Swiss articles; three (5.00%) are Italian articles;
three (5%) are Scottish articles; two (3.33%) are Canadian
articles; two (3.33%) are Turkish articles and, with one
(1.67%) article the French, Belgian and Slovakian studies
are included (Figure 2).
Observing the publication’s quadrennial evolution graphic,
a small tendency of increase was observed (Figure 3).
Among the 60 papers that appear in the bibliography of
this text, through a laborious and error subjected evaluation,
the existence of varied types of publications is evidenced:
1) a first series (1.67%) of six non-randomized patients [5];
2) a series (1.67%) of 60 patients submitted the CPB and
randomized to study the inflammatory reaction [12]; 3) a
series (1.67%) of 54 non-randomized patients [6,7]; 4) a series
(1.67%) of 56 randomized patients in which 28 had received
MB to treat VS in cardiac surgery´s postoperative [8-10]
and; 5) a series (1.67%) of 100 patients with VS risk factors
that had been randomized and 50 patients that received MB
before the CPB [11]. Observing the other 55 studies we can
find: 1) one study (1.67%) based on evidences through meta￾nalysis of literature [13]; 2) seven review articles (11.67%) Fig. 1 - Bibliographical research using two databases (MEDLINE

[4,14,23]. The other bibliographical citations in number of
44 (73.33%) are distributed as case reports (great majority)
[24-36], letters [37-44], technical aspects of the MB use [45-
50] and other studies involving risk [51,52], the VS incidence
in the “off pump” CABG and the possibility of MB use in
anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock [53], also a proposal of
the author of this text (Figure 4) [54-58]. The presented
numbers, surely, are not totally compatible with the total of
publications, but it is possible to assume that this imprecision
does not affect the general vision of the problem.
the GMPc system it “liberates” the AMPc system, in a kind
of “crosstalk” between the two systems and, thus, the
noradrenaline one starts to exert its vasoconstrictor effect;
7) A therapeutical protocol does not exist. The dosage used
to treat metahemoglobinemia (2 mg/kg in bolus EV) has been
used, and as its plasmatic concentration decays strongly in
the first 40 minutes, it is logical the maintenance of the same
dose in continuous infusion in the next hour after EV bolus.
There are personal reports using up to 7 mg/kg without
collateral effect; 8) Nowadays a “window of opportunity” is
proposed for the MB efficiency to restore systemic vascular
resistance; 9) Beyond sepsis and other distributive
circulatory shock types, if exists another vasoplegic
condition to be benefited by the MB use it should be
speculated; 10) The authors have positive experience in
anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock and protamine treatment
reactions and; 11) The authors of this study, based on
isolated clinical comments, have attempted to experimentally
investigate two other aspects that are common in cardiac
surgery, that could benefit by MB use: cappillary
permeability and the blood clotting.
DISCUSSION
One problem in describing the VS is the lack of
consistency in its definition. There is no clear definition,
not even a single biomarker, including the determination of
nitrite/nitrate (NOx), to characterize the syndrome. Actually,
the VS is a constellation of signs and symptoms:
hypotension, high cardiac index, low systemic vascular
resistance, low filling pressures and maintained hypotension
despite the use of high doses of vasoconstrictor amines.
This problem leads to an indefinition of its incidence
ranging from 0.21% to 13% [3,4,10]. The largest series of
prospective studies indicate an incidence of 8% to 12%
[6,10,11] The mortality is high, ranging from 16 to 27%
[6,10,11], and therefore has been the subject of several studies
aimed on improving the outcomes of these patients. MB has
been used as a therapeutic option in these situations.
The VS has multifactorial genesis and in the case of patients
undergoing cardiac surgery, is mainly due to exposure of
the body to non-physiological materials and the use of
heparin/protamine [15], triggering the inflammatory response
syndrome (SIRS). During this process, it occurs complement
activation, cytokine release, leukocyte activation and
expression of adhesion molecules, and various substances
production, such as oxygen free radicals, arachidonic acid
metabolites, platelet activity factor, nitric oxide and
endothelin. The consequences of SIRS can be tragic and
may lead to multiple organs and systems dysfunction, as
occurs in septic shock. The systemic vascular resistance
decrease observed in the VS is associated with excessive
production of NO.

Regarding the questions presented in methods: 1)
Heparin and the ACE inhibitors, until the moment, are the
only medications considered as risk factor for VS [51]; 2)
From the verification that the inflammatory reaction can be
present in patients operated without CPB, the focus was
moved for the concept that, more than the blood contact
with the CPB circuit, the contact of the blood with the
operatory wound would be the greater responsible to trigger
the CPB inflammation phenomenon; 3) In the commonly
used doses MB is a safe drug. (the lethal dose is of 40mg/
kg). The accumulation of clinical experience has tested the
binomium efficiency/security; 4) In contrast to the inhibition
of the NO synthesis (L-NAME), in vivo MB injections do
not cause endothelium dysfunction; 5) The MB injection in
non VS patients does not have hemodynamic effects that
needs an up-regulated NO state; 6) It is necessary to make
it clear that MB, by itself, is not a vasoconstrictor. By blocking

 In these situations, NO induces loss of vascular
sensitivity to catecholamines and myocardial depression
that contributes to lethal hipotension. Any process in which
there is pro-inflammatory cytokines release can cause excess
production of NO, as occurs, possibly in patients undergoing
cardiopulmonary bypass. Clinical studies also show
increased production of NO in adults and children with
various forms of shock, with increased serum nitrate levels
if correlated with vasodilation. Vessels isolated from animals
in shock show a pronounced hyporeactivity to almost all
vasoconstrictor agents tested (epinephrine, norepinephrine,
phenylephrine, dopamine, endothelin, angiotensin,
thromboxane, etc.). This hyporeactivity can be reversed by
NOS inhibitors and specific iNOS inhibitors.
 Although endothelial cells can be induced to form NO,
it is possible that the major source of production is the
vessel’s own smooth muscle. The NO produced by iNOS
expression in the vasculature is responsible for the excessive
vasodilation and reduced contractile responses to
vasopressor agents. In addition to the data showing an
increased formation of NO by iNOS in various forms of
shock, there are compelling data that demonstrate that the
biosynthesis of NO by ecNOS expression in the vascular
endothelium in cases of hemorrhagic or endotoxic shock is
compromised. This mechanism is sometimes referred to as a
functional exchange between the isoforms of NOS with
expression of iNOS and down-regulation of ecNOS at the
same time. Impaired expression of ecNOS may be detrimental
to important organs such as brain, heart, kidneys associating
itself to the dysfunction of multiple organs. The reduction
in NO production is associated, as well, to the antiplatelet
activity and activation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes,
contributing, with peroxynitrite dependent mechanisms, to
endothelial injury and tissue damage.
 These pathophysiology data, presented in a generic
sense, may be reviewed by at least three references cited in
the text provided [13,14,18]. From these concepts a certainty
emanates, that is: the VS is a consequence of systemic
inflammatory reaction, being, therefore, an endothelial
vasoplegic dysfunction [37].
 Regarding the therapeutic principles for endothelial
vasoplegic dysfunction treatment associated with heart
surgery, some comments are relevant. The first and most
important concept concerns the restrictions on the use of
nonspecific inhibitors of NO synthesis (L-NMMA, L - NAME,
etc.). Another logical approach would be to inhibit NO
synthesis with the use of specific inhibitors such as LNAME
and L-NMMA. This approach is prone to criticism for it
involves ethical issues related to the use of new therapies,
besides blocking, not only iNOS, but also its
constitutiveenzyme’s (eNOS) physiological form. The use of
specific iNOS inhibition, for example, with aminoguanidine,
remains in logical and speculative territories.
Considering specifically the vasoplegia associated with
various states of circulatory shock, some points can be
emphasized: 1) the use of steroids to inhibit inflammation
and block the action of iNOS, 2) the norepinephrine is an
amine that does not promote increased heart rate, and may
even decrease it, 3) the use of methylene blue (2 mg / kg as
intravenous in bolus dose or half the in bolus dose followed
by continuous infusion of additional doses), 4) the use of
metoprolol injection (5 mg) to reverse the downregulation
situation of the beta receptors which is a consequence of
tachycardia and the use of amine.
 Because of this phenomenon a smaller number of beta
receptors are available for an effective action of beta￾adrenergic drugs, occurring tachyphylaxis. It is extremely
important to avoid excessive fluid ressuscitation, the main
objective is to reverse the vasoplegia with vasoconstrictors
and methylene blue. Because hypotension is refractory to
the amine, the use of methylene blue has been a lifesaver. The
option of arginine vasopressin use is quite attractive, but
there is not enough clinical experience with this drug yet.
 The NO actions depends on the cyclic GMP activation,
but besides this mechanism of paramount importance, we
have also focused our attention on the cyclic AMP system,
which is why we are using, almost as a routine,
betablockers injection (metoprolol), when the patient is
very tachycardic [4,20].
 Regarding the medications associated with the emergence
of VS in cardiac surgery, heparin and angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) are, so far, the only ones considered as a risk
factor for VS. In our daily practice during the 15 years account
for the observations included in this text, we have sought a
causal relationship, and various aspects were considered:
1) the majority of cases occurred during or after CPB, 2) in
the past, there were several cases associated with curare
aloferine use during anesthesia induction, 3) some, more
attenuated, cases occurred during anesthetical induction
with standardized technique withetomidate, fentanyl, and
pavulon diazepine, 4) some cases were clearly associated
with the use of protamine, 5) in some cases we had the
impression that vasodilation occurred after heparin use, 6)
vasoplegic syndrome in non-cardiac surgeries was observed,
7) It seems that the cases occur in outbreaks, suggesting a
relationship with drug lots, 8) there is no relation with the
type of heart surgery, 9) many patients are diabetics, and
10) many patients had previously used the calcium
antagonist diltiazem[19].
There was a change regarding the paradigm that
inflammatory reaction associated with VS would be caused
by blood exposure to the non-endothelial surface of the
ECC, after it was verified that the inflammatory response is
present in off-pump patients [54]. A change tendency is
observed in the concept that, more than the contact with
the CPB circuit, the contact of the blood with the wound

would be the biggest responsible for the inflammation
phenomenon in CPB [20].
As to the safety and ethical aspects of MB´s clinical use,
it can be affirmed that, in recommended doses it is a safe drug
(the lethal dose is 40 mg/kg) [22]. The accumulation of clinical
experience has been testing the binomial efficiency / safety.
These results show that intravenous infusion of MB seems
to be safe. The findings support clinical trials where MB was
used to treat VS post-coronary artery bypass grafting with
CPB on inflammatory response syndrome patients - SIRS and
anaphylaxis. These results are not unexpected, especially
when analyzed in healthy animals, in which the hemodynamic
presents a fine regulation, but not total, under the control of
NO. In these conditions no action is expected when there is
inhibition of guanylate cyclase by MB.
MB injection in a non VS carrier individual does not
have hemodynamic effects in normal conditions. The MB
effect only appears in the case of NO supra-regulation, and
thus, spasm occurrence in coronary arterial grafts is unlikely
[22]. The vasospasm risk and thrombosis of these grafts
require confirmation in vivo. The security perception is fully
grounded in data set in studies in healthy animals that
received the MB in vivo. Although ischemic events were
not evidenced in the ECG monitoring, the normal vascular
reactivity, endothelium dependent and independent, was
determined by in vitro studies [21]. With a wide safety range,
these data support the assumption that, unlike the NO
(LNAME) synthesis inhibition, the injection in vivo does
not cause endothelial dysfunction.
Regarding to recovery and better control of blood pressure,
it must be made clear that MB alone is not a vasoconstrictor.
By blocking the cGMP it “releases” the cAMP system in a kind
of “crosstalk” between the two systems and, thus,
norepinephrine exercises its vasoconstrictor effect.
Regarding to the treatment regimen, it still does not exist
a therapeutic dosage protocol scheme. It has been adopted
in most publications, the dosage used for the treatment of
methemoglobinemia and sepsis (2 mg/kg bolus IV). As its
plasma concentration declines sharply during the first 40
minutes of bolus infusion, we have been maintaining the
same dose in continuous infusion on the next hour. There
are personal reports of its use on up to 7 mg/kg without side
effects [8-10]. As the lethal dosage, determined in goats, is
40 mg/kg, we believe that there is, in extreme cases, the total
dosage use of up to 10 mg/kg. It should be noted that this is
an assumption and can not be considered a therapeutic
principle. There is at least one report at the dosage of 10 mg
/ kg without complications and with clinical improvement of
patients [42] and clinical and statistical improvement of
systemic vascular resistance, lactate and norepinephrine.
The criterion used was: NE µg/kg/min, CI > 2.5 L/m2/min
and SVR <350 dyne * s * cm-5. We should highlight two
technical aspects: the MB injection interferes with pulse
oximetry, giving the false impression of arterial unsaturation,
and this effect is transient.
In the MB adverse effects are included: cardiac
arrhythmias (nodal rhythm and transient isolated ventricular
extrasystoles, angina and coronary vasoconstriction,
decreased cardiac output and renal blood flow and
mesenteric resistance, increased pulmonary artery pressure
with deterioration of gas exchange. Cardiac arrhythmias and
angina are transient and have not been reported with a dose
of 2 mg/kg. The vast majority of studies reported unchanged
lung and kidney function. Other side effects include
confusion, headache, vomiting and abdominal pain.
MB is reduced to blue leukomethylene in the erythrocyte
and is excreted in the urine at that form and as MB itself,
explaining the greenish color of urine. Hemolytic anemia
and hyperbilirubinemia have been rarely reported with the
use of high doses of MB. Some changes in liver enzymes
have been reported in some studies that speculate that these
changes are due to combined use of MB and adrenaline
[49]. The only drug interaction described concerns hemolytic
anemia exacerbation caused by the dapsone by the active
hydroxylamine formation, which oxidizes hemoglobin. In our
laboratory we have systematically observed increases in
tissue levels of malondialdehyde acid (MDA) measured as
a free radicals biomarker [22].
The MB antioxidant effects are well known, what
presents itself as a contradiction and leads us to speculate
that MB may be interfering with the MDA measurement.
This fact occurs in relation to lactate. Its sharp decrease can
not be considered since MB reacts directly with lactate,
giving the false impression of immediate improvement in
tissue exchange. In sufficiently vasodilated patients skin
color is blue-gray, as well as the rare skin lesions quickly
revert themselves [18].
Regarding ethical aspects, it can be affirmed that MB
can be used in clinical practice because it has been used
since late 19th century for the treatment of malaria, which
granted Paul Ehrlich the Medicine Nobel Prize in 1908. MB
is the precursory molecule of: chemotherapy, antibiotics and
neuroleptics (chlorpromazine), with long use as a urinary
antiseptic, Schizophrenia treatment and as an additive to
stored blood bags, in order to neutralize microorganisms
involved, for example, with AIDS and Chagas Disease. A
curiosity, which indirectly relates to its security, is its use in
fish tanks, where MB combats algae and microorganisms.
involved, for example, with AIDS and Chagas Disease.
This text could not fail to comment on a question of
fundamental importance, related to the use of MB: Why
does vasoplegic state sometimes promptly revert and,
sometimes, nothing seems to help?. Recently, a well
established doctoral thesis was defended at the Federal
University of Florianopolis. This thesis has been published
and brings some extremely important data to try to answer

that question [22]. A sepsis model used in mice allowed the
authors to demonstrate, in a period of 24 hours divided into
three periods of eight hours, that there is a dynamic
guanylate cyclase action in such a way as to create a
“window of opportunity” for methylene blue efficiency to
help restore systemic vascular resistance. Vasoreactivity
no longer occurs in the first eight hours, not only by amines
action, but also by the nitric oxide donor drugs. This phase
coincides with increased iNOS expression. Between eight
and sixteen hours the guanylate cyclase expression is absent,
probably by excessive nitric oxide production, and thus, in
this phase methylene blue would not act. Later, between
sixteen and twenty-four hours there would be a guanylate
cyclase synthesis “again”, and methylene blue would again
be effective (Figure 5)
Fig. 5 - “Window of opportunity” for methylene bule use depending
on activity of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC); iNOS = inducible
nitric oxide synthase. Prot = protein. Adaptation of Fernandes,
2001 (Reference 23)
 Considering these findings, we started to use MB
Considering these findings, we started to use MB infusion
even with no apparent effectiveness, waiting for the
“window of opportunity”, that is, for the guanylate cyclase
synthesis “again”. In one patient with diabetes who had
undergone aortic valve replacement, we used this principle
and the theory of Fernandes seemed to be confirmed. The
patient presented excellent response in the cardiopulmonary
bypass, then stopped responding, but still we maintained a
continuous infusion of methylene blue in addition to high
doses of adrenaline and noradrenaline. On the fourth day
after surgery we repeated new intravenous bolus of
methylene blue, the response was very satisfactory and in
the fifth day, the infusion of amines to maintain blood
pressure and vascular resistance stability in normal values
was no longer needed.
Regarding the MB use in other forms of vasoplegia
treatment, the author recommended its use in circulatory
collapse associated with anaphylaxis and anaphylactic
shock. MB can save lives, as demonstrated by the experience
that has been recognized nationally and internationally [58].
The same can be said for the therapeutic effect of MB on
the catastrophic reactions induced by protamine sulfate [15].
The literature review, illustrated in Figures 2, 3 and 4
shows that 1) the vast majority of publications (33.33%) are
Brazilian, 2) only two studies reported large randomized
series and 3) there are seven complete revisions on the
subject. These data reinforce the VS description in cardiac
surgery and its treatment with MB, is a major contribution
of Brazilian heart surgery. It is clear that the option is valid
respecting the already mentioned “therapeutic window” and
that the study we performed, based on evidence [13],
confirms the need for multicenter studies.
At least two original and practical lines of research
deserve further investigation on MB’s possible effect on
capillary blood, and its possible effects on coagulation.
Isolated observations in patients with bacterial endocarditis
undergoing emergency valve surgery suggest that this
group of patients could have pulmonary circulation
improvements. On the other hand, MB has been used as an
option for heparin neutralization in patients with intolerance
protamine use, this option being surrounded by
controversy.
Finally, MB is an option for VS treatment in cases of
firstline treatment failure (blood volume adjustment and
amines judicious use). Early use of MB can block the
systemic vascular resistance progression’s decrease in
patients responsive to norepinephrine and mitigate the need
for prolonged vasoconstrictor use. However, schemes and
protocols need to be clearly defined for its routine use. It is
a matter of debate whether MB can be a firstline treatment in
patients with vasoplegia, and there is still no evidence to
support this fact. Studies based on evidence points to the
need for more scientific evidence to define the MB role in
the treatment of VS refractory to the use of amines [13,18].
One of these studies, from our authorship, using the
evidence-based technique, showed lack of experimental
evidence, requiring further large multicenter studies,
adopting Levin´s (Argentina) [7-9] and Ozal (Turkey) [11]
studies principles.
By the historical analysis, it is clear that the use
specifically in VS associated with cardiac surgery is a
Brazilian contribution. Its use in sepsis is already provided
without the use of large multicenter studies confirming the
inflammatory process as the main mechanism involved. To
assign a possible role of “vasopressin deficiency” as most
important VS mechanism is at least reckless. Although no
definitive multicentric studies, and despite all the obstacles,
MB use in the VS treatment in cardiac surgery is, nowadays,

CONCLUSIONS
The data from this extended review leaves the impression
that the number and quality of publications do not reflect
the frequency at which MB is used in clinical practice.
Therefore, it is implied the difficulty of performing multicenter
studies. The disclosure and possible consecration of this
therapy will be passed on as verbal information and,
depending on the increase of publications, in studies based
on evidence. In the literature data and medical practice set
remains the certainty that the soluble guanylate cyclase
blockage in distributive shock control remains
underestimated [59,60].
