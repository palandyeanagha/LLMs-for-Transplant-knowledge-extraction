Receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK) 1 and RIPK3 have emerged as essential kinases mediating a regulated form of
necrosis, known as necroptosis, that can be induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling. As a consequence, inhibiting
RIPK1 kinase activity and repressing RIPK3 expression levels have become commonly used approaches to estimate the
contribution of necroptosis to specific phenotypes. Here, we report that RIPK1 kinase activity and RIPK3 also contribute to TNF￾induced apoptosis in conditions of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1 and 2 (cIAP1/2) depletion or TGF-b-activated kinase 1 (TAK1)
kinase inhibition, implying that inhibition of RIPK1 kinase activity or depletion of RIPK3 under cell death conditions is not always
a prerequisite to conclude on the involvement of necroptosis. Moreover, we found that, contrary to cIAP1/2 depletion, TAK1
kinase inhibition induces assembly of the cytosolic RIPK1/Fas-associated protein with death domain/caspase-8 apoptotic TNF
receptor 1 (TNFR1) complex IIb without affecting the RIPK1 ubiquitylation status at the level of TNFR1 complex I. These results
indicate that the recruitment of TAK1 to the ubiquitin (Ub) chains, and not the Ub chains per se, regulates the contribution of
RIPK1 to the apoptotic death trigger. In line with this, we found that cylindromatosis repression only provided protection to TNF￾mediated RIPK1-dependent apoptosis in condition of reduced RIPK1 ubiquitylation obtained by cIAP1/2 depletion but not upon
TAK1 kinase inhibition, again arguing for a role of TAK1 in preventing RIPK1-dependent apoptosis downstream of RIPK1
ubiquitylation. Importantly, we found that this function of TAK1 was independent of its known role in canonical nuclear factor-jB
(NF-jB) activation. Our study therefore reports a new function of TAK1 in regulating an early NF-jB-independent cell death
checkpoint in the TNFR1 apoptotic pathway. In both TNF-induced RIPK1 kinase-dependent apoptotic models, we found that
RIPK3 contributes to full caspase-8 activation independently of its kinase activity or intact RHIM domain. In contrast, RIPK3
participates in caspase-8 activation by acting downstream of the cytosolic death complex assembly, possibly via reactive
oxygen species generation.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a pleiotropic cytokine that
controls a variety of cellular responses, including proliferation,
differentiation, inflammatory cytokine production, survival and
death.1 TNF signals by binding and activating two cell surface
receptors, TNF receptor (TNFR) 1 and TNFR2,2 but most of
its biological activities have been associated with TNFR1.3 In
most cell types, TNFR1 activation does not induce cell death
but instead leads to the transcriptional upregulation of genes
encoding pro-survival and pro-inflammatory molecules.4 This
function is mediated by the assembly of a plasma membrane￾bound multiprotein signaling complex, referred to as TNFR1
complex I,5 that contains TNF receptor-associated death
domain (TRADD), receptor-interacting protein kinase
1 (RIPK1, also known as RIP1), TNF receptor-associated
factor 2, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 and 2
(cIAP1/2) and the linear ubiquitin (Ub) chain assembly
complex.6 Within this complex, RIPK1 and other proteins
are rapidly conjugated with Ub chains of various types.7–10
These Ub chains act as scaffolds for the recruitment and
activation of the TAK1-binding protein 2/3 (TAB2/3)–TGF-b￾activated kinase 1 (TAK1) complex and the inhibitor of nuclear
factor-kB (NF-kB) kinase (IKK) complex (NEMO-IKKa-IKKb),

which subsequently leads to the activation of the mitogen￾activated protein kinases and canonical NF-kB signaling
pathways that collectively drive transcription of genes that
prevent cell death and sustain inflammation. Accordingly,
when the NF-kB response is inhibited, either genetically or by
the use of the general translation inhibitor cycloheximide
(CHX), TNFR1 ligation switches from a pro-survival to a
pro-apoptotic response. This switch occurs via a mechanism
that involves internalization of complex I and assembly of a
cytoplasmic caspase-8-inducing death complex, known as
TNFR1 complex IIa, which contains TRADD, Fas-associated
protein with death domain (FADD) and procaspase-8.5,11
Under these conditions, TNF-mediated death was shown not
to depend on RIPK1.12,13
cIAP1/2 are required for TNF-induced canonical NF-kB
activation.10,14–16 Consequently, their depletion, obtained
either genetically or by the use of Smac Mimetics (SM), also
induces a switch to apoptosis. Intriguingly, in the absence of
cIAP1/2, TNF-induced death was shown to rely on RIPK1
and not on TRADD,12,15,17–19 suggesting that cIAP1/2
additionally regulate an NF-kB-independent cell death
checkpoint in the TNFR1 pathway. To discriminate the
RIPK1-containing cytosolic death complex obtained in
cIAP1/2-depleted conditions from complex IIa, it has been
defined as complex IIb.11 The molecular mechanism
accounting for the differential assembly of complex IIa
versus IIb is poorly understood, but suggested to rely on
RIPK1 ubiquitylation status in complex I. Indeed, cIAP1/2
act as direct ubiquitin ligases for RIPK18,14,15,20,21 and
cIAP1/2-mediated RIPK1 ubiquitylation in complex I is
believed to prevent the transition of RIPK1 from complex I to
complex II.12,15,22,23 A notion supported by the fact that
repression of the RIPK1 deubiquitinase cylindromatosis
(CYLD) inhibits recruitment of RIPK1 to complex IIb.12
In addition to apoptosis, TNF signaling can also induce
necroptosis, a regulated form of necrosis that prevails in
caspase-8-inhibited conditions, and whose physiological
relevance has recently been demonstrated by in vivo
studies.24 TNF-mediated necroptosis relies on the assembly
of another cytosolic death complex, known as the
necrosome, which consists of FADD, RIPK1 and RIPK3.25–27
Because both RIPK1 and RIPK3 kinase activities were
shown to be crucial for necroptosis induction, necrostatin-1
(Nec-1), an inhibitor of RIPK1 kinase activity,28 is
commonly used as a chemical tool to inhibit necroptosis. As
an alternative approach, RIPK3 depletion has become a gold
standard to estimate the contribution of necroptosis in a
defined phenotype.29
In this study, we report on a new NF-kB-independent but
kinase-dependent function of TAK1 in protecting cells from
complex IIb-mediated apoptotic cell death. Because TAK1
kinase inhibition induces complex IIb assembly without
affecting RIPK1 ubiquitylation in complex I, our results
suggest that the recruitment of TAK1 to the Ub chains
conjugated to RIPK1 and not the Ub chains per se regulates
the death potential of RIPK1. In addition, we demonstrate
that the use of Nec-1 or the depletion of RIPK3 protects
cells from TNF-mediated RIPK1-dependent apoptosis,
both in conditions of cIAP1/2 depletion or TAK1 kinase
inhibition.
Results
TAK1 kinase activity protects cells from TNF-induced
RIPK1 kinase-dependent apoptosis independently
of NF-jB activation. TNFR1 engagement has been
reported to mediate both RIPK1-independent and -dependent
apoptosis based on the cellular context.12,15,17 The
kinase activity of TAK1 has a crucial role in the activation of
the mitogen-activated protein kinases and canonical NF-kB
pathways downstream of TNFR1.30,31 As a consequence,
TAK1-deficient cells were shown to succumb by apoptosis
upon single TNF stimulation.31–33 However, whether these
cells die apoptotically in a RIPK1-independent or -dependent
manner is unclear. Because TAK1 recruitment to complex I is
reported to occur downstream of RIPK1 ubiquitylation, we
speculated that TAK1 kinase inhibition would sensitize cells
to TNF-induced apoptosis in a RIPK1-independent manner.
Surprisingly, we found that RIPK1-deficiency protected
immortalized MEFs against death induced by TNF in
the presence of the TAK1 kinase inhibitor NP-009245
(TNF þ TAK1i) similarly as against co-treatment with the
SM CmpA34 (TNF þ SM; Figures 1a and b, Supplementary
Figures S1A, B). Of note, at the concentrations used, cell
death occurred more rapidly with the TAK1 kinase inhibitor
than with the SM. As negative control, we treated the MEFs
with TNF in the presence of low concentration of CHX
(TNF þ CHX) and, as previously reported,13 observed that
Ripk1  /  MEFs were not protected but sensitized to this
apoptotic trigger (Supplementary Figure S2). Interestingly,
we found that inhibiting RIPK1 kinase activity by
Nec-1-protected Ripk1 þ / þ MEFs to either TNF þ TAK1i or
TNF þ SM as efficiently as the RIPK1 deficiency itself
(Figures 1c and d, Supplementary Figures S1A and B). As
RIPK1 kinase activity is mainly associated with necroptotic
cell death, we confirmed protection to apoptosis, and not
necroptosis, by measuring caspase-3 activity by DEVDase
assay (Figures 1e–h, Supplementary Figures S1C and D, 3),
by monitoring processing of caspase-8, caspase-3 and
PARP (Figures 1i and j) and by analyzing the cell death
morphology (Supplementary Figure S4). Of note, although
apoptosis induction upon TNF þ TAK1i or TNF þ SM
treatment had been confirmed, we found that inhibiting
caspase activity by the use of the pan caspase inhibitor
zVAD-fmk (Z-Val-Ala-DL-Asp-fluoromethylketone) did not
protect cells from death but instead induced a switch to
RIPK1/3-dependent necroptosis in both conditions
(Supplementary Figures S4, S5A and SB and data not shown).
To exclude an off-target effect of the TAK1 kinase inhibitor,
we confirmed the requirement of RIPK1 kinase activity for
TNF-mediated apoptosis in the absence of functional TAK1
using Tak1 þ / þ and Tak1  /  MEFs treated with TNF in the
absence or presence of Nec-1 (Supplementary Figure S5C).
Of note, the TAK1 kinase inhibitor did not sensitize
Tak1  /  MEFs to apoptosis induced by TNF, demonstrating
the TAK1-specific effect of the inhibitor (data not shown).
Finally, to further investigate whether the protective role of
TAK1 and cIAP1/2 against RIPK1-dependent apoptosis was
depending on NF-kB activation, we analyzed the effect of
TAK1 inhibition or cIAP1/2 depletion in MEFs unable to mount
an NF-kB response due to stable expression of an IkBa

mutant resistant to proteasomal degradation (IkBaSR).35
As shown in Figure 2, single TNF stimulation induced
RIPK1-kinase independent apoptosis in the IkBaSR MEFs,
but co-stimulation with either TAK1i or SM led to an increase in
cell death and caspase-3 activity that could be inhibited by
Nec-1.
Together, our results demonstrate that, similar to cIAP1/2
depletion by SM, TAK1 kinase inhibition induces RIPK1
kinase-dependent apoptosis upon TNF stimulation, which
could be switched to necroptosis by inhibiting caspase
activity. Importantly, the RIPK1 dependency in apoptosis
induction originates from the fact that both TAK1 and cIAP1/2

regulate an early NF-kB-independent cell death checkpoint in
the TNFR1 pathway, in addition to their reported role in NF-kB
activation.
TAK1 kinase inhibition induces complex IIb assembly
without affecting RIPK1 ubiquitylation at complex I. The
combination of TNF and SM leads to apoptosis through
assembly of a caspase-8-activating complex, referred to as
complex IIb, consisting of FADD, procaspase-8 and
RIPK1.12,15,17 To determine whether TAK1 kinase inhibition
similarly induces TNF-mediated RIPK1-dependent apoptosis
via complex IIb assembly, we immunoprecipitated caspase-8
in MEFs stimulated either with TNF þ TAK1i or TNF þ SM,
and analyzed RIPK1 recruitment by immunoblotting. These
immunoprecipitations were performed in the absence or
presence of zVAD-fmk, as previous studies indicated that
complex IIb detection requires caspase inhibition to avoid
proteolytic cleavage of RIPK1 by capase-8.12,15,17,36 As
shown in Figures 3a and b, both TNF þ TAK1i and TNF þ SM
treatments led to complex IIb assembly, which was better
detected in the presence of zVAD-fmk. Cleaved fragments of
RIPK1 were mostly observed in the absence of zVAD-fmk.
Importantly, Nec-1 completely inhibited complex IIb assem￾bly both in the absence or presence of zVAD-fmk, further
demonstrating the kinase-dependent role of RIPK1 in
TNF þ TAK1i and TNF þ SM apoptotic settings.
The recruitment of RIPK1 to complex IIb in cIAP1/2-
depleted conditions is thought to originate from defective
RIPK1 ubiquitylation at complex I. We therefore compared
RIPK1 ubiquitylation status at the receptor complex by
immunoprecipitating TNFR1 using FLAG-hTNF in MEFs
pre-treated, or not, with either TAK1 inhibitor or SM for
30 min. Although SM pre-treatment greatly affected RIPK1
ubiquitylation, TAK1 kinase inhibition had no effect on RIPK1
ubiquitylation status or on cIAP1 levels (Figures 3c and d).
Of note, no difference in RIPK1 ubiquitylation levels was
observed at the level complex IIb between TNF þ TAK1i and
TNF þ SM treatments (Figure 3e). Also, contrary to its crucial
role in complex IIb assembly, we found that RIPK1 kinase
activity was dispensable for the recruitment and ubiquitylation
of RIPK1 at complex I (Figure 3f).
Because the de-ubiquitinase CYLD was suggested to
promote complex IIb assembly under SM conditions by
dismantling the Ub chains remaining on RIPK1 at complex I,12
we next compared the effect of CYLD repression on
apoptotic cell death induced by TNF þ TAK1i and TNF þ SM.
As shown in Figures 4a–d (and Supplementary Figure S6),
CYLD repression provided protection to apoptosis induced
by TNF þ SM, but not by TNF þ TAK1i. Those effects,
respectively, correlated with defective and unaffected
complex IIb formation (Figure 4e).
Our data therefore indicate that it is not per se the Ub chains
conjugated to RIPK1 at complex I but instead the recruitment
of TAK1 to these Ub chains that, either directly or indirectly,
regulates the integration of RIPK1 in complex IIb. The fact that
CYLD repression does not provide protection under TAK1

samples. The results are representative of at least two independent experiments. (e–g) Control MEFs or MEFs overexpressing IkBaSR were pretreated with media (e), TAK1i

kinase inhibition highlights the role of TAK1 downstream of
RIPK1 ubiquitylation in the early NF-kB-independent cell
death checkpoint of the TNFR1 pathway.
RIPK3 deficiency affects TNFR1-mediated RIPK1
kinase-dependent apoptosis. RIPK3 has emerged as an
essential kinase in necroptosis induction25–27 and, as a
consequence, RIPK3 repression has become a proof of
principle to highlight the contribution of necroptosis in a
defined phenotype; although initial reports on RIPK3
indicated that its ectopic expression could also induce
apoptosis.37,38 To investigate whether RIPK3 could
contribute to TNF-induced RIPK1-dependent apoptosis, we
stimulated immortalized Ripk3 þ / þ and Ripk3  /  MEFs with
TNF þ SM and TNF þ TAK1i. Remarkably, we observed that
RIPK3 deficiency provided partial protection to both apoptotic
triggers (Figures 5a–d, Supplementary Figure S7). The
reduction in RIPK1-dependent apoptosis was accompanied
by a reduction in caspase-8, caspase-3 and PARP cleavage
(Figures 5e and f), indicating a role for RIPK3 upstream or at
the level of caspase-8. To further validate the role of RIPK3
in TNFR1-mediated RIPK1-dependent caspase-8 activation,
we immunoprecipitated active caspase-8 using biotin-IETD￾fmk in Ripk3 þ / þ and Ripk3  /  primary MEFs stimulated
with TNF þ SM, and again observed defective caspase-8
activation in the absence of RIPK3 (Figure 5g). The role of
RIPK3 in TNF þ TAK1i- and TNF þ SM-induced apoptosis
was also confirmed by repressing RIPK3 in the Ripk1 þ / þ
MEFs using miRNA (Figures 5h–l, Supplementary Figure S8).
Interestingly, RIPK3 deficiency did not provide protection to
RIPK1-independent apoptosis induced by Fas ligation
(Supplementary Figure S9).
Our results therefore demonstrate that RIPK3 specifically
contributes to TNFR1-mediated RIPK1-dependent apoptosis,
in addition to its well-established role in TNF-induced
necroptosis.
RIPK3 differentially regulates TNF-mediated apoptosis
and necroptosis. Necroptosis induction relies on both
RIPK1 and RIPK3 kinase activities, and on the physical

interaction between RIPK1 and RIPK3 via their respective
RHIM domains.25,26 To test whether these domains of RIPK3
are also required for its contribution to TNF-mediated RIPK1-
dependent apoptosis, we lentivirally reconstituted Ripk3  / 
MEFs with an empty vector (ctrl), with wild-type (WT) RIPK3
and with two mutants of RIPK3 reported to inhibit necroptosis
induction: a kinase-dead mutant (KD)25 and a RHIM domain
mutant (RHIM*).26 Interestingly, we found that reconstitution
of Ripk3  /  MEFs with all three RIPK3 variants equally
rescued caspase-3 activation upon TNF þ SM or TNF þ
TAK1i treatment (Figures 6a and b). The extent of rescue
correlated with the relative RIPK3 expression levels between
the Ripk3  /  reconstituted cells and the Ripk3 þ / þ MEFs
(Figure 6c). Nevertheless, we observed that the cells
reconstituted with WT RIPK3 succumbed to the treatment
almost as efficiently as the Ripk3 þ / þ MEFs, whereas the
cells reconstituted with KD and RHIM*, RIPK3 only partially
recovered the cell death sensitivity (Figure 6d). Because
cells reconstituted with the two RIPK3 mutants are unable to
rescue any sensitivity to RIPK3-dependent necroptosis
(Supplementary Figure S10), the difference in cell death
sensitivity between the three RIPK3 variants upon
TNF þ TAK1i treatment presumably originates from the fact
that the ectopic expression of WT RIPK3 in Ripk3  /  MEFs
induces necroptosis on top of apoptosis, which is impossible
for the two RIPK3 mutants.
Together, our data indicate that RIPK3 contributes to
TNF-mediated RIPK1-dependent apoptosis independently
of its kinase activity or intact RHIM, and therefore demon￾strate that RIPK3 differentially regulates apoptosis and
necroptosis downstream of TNFR1.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging inhibits
TNFR1-mediated RIPK1-dependent apoptosis. It was
recently suggested that, in the context of the inflammasome,
RIPK3 induces caspase-8 activation through ROS
production via an uncharacterized mechanism.39 To inves￾tigate whether the contribution of RIPK3 to caspase-8
activation in our cellular system also involves ROS generation,
we first analyzed the effect of ROS scavenging, using
butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and n-acetylcysteine, on
RIPK1-dependent apoptosis induced by TNF þ TAK1i and
TNF þ SM. We found that ROS scavenging protected the
MEFs from these apoptotic triggers even more potently than
Nec-1 (Figure 7a). Importantly, this protection was asso￾ciated with the inhibition of caspase-8 and caspase-3
processing (Figures 7b–d), implying a role for ROS in the
early signaling phase of RIPK1-dependent apoptosis. We
therefore analyzed whether ROS scavenging could interfere
with complex IIb assembly, and found that 30 min pre￾treatment with BHA almost completely inhibited the associa￾tion of RIPK1 with caspase-8 (Figure 7e). Of note, BHA pre￾treatment had no effects on the recruitment of RIPK1 to
complex I (Figure 7f), demonstrating a role for ROS in the
transition from complex I to complex IIb.
RIPK3 regulates TNF-mediated RIPK1-dependent apoptosis
downstream of complex IIb assembly, possibly via
ROS generation. Knowing that caspase-8 activation was
positively regulated by both RIPK3 and ROS in our
TNFþ TAK1i and TNFþ SM settings, and that a RIPK3-ROS￾caspase-8 activation axis had previously been suggested,39
we next analyzed the effect of RIPK3 deficiency on ROS
generation upon TNFþ TAK1i treatment. As RIPK3 repression
is known to affect ROS levels under necroptotic
conditions,40 we included TNF þ TAK1iþ zVAD-fmk treatment
as a positive control in our experiments. Remarkably, we
found that RIPK3 deficiency affected ROS levels in both
necroptotic and apoptotic conditions, whereas no difference
in ROS levels was detected in unstimulated conditions
(Figure 7g). However, and contrary to ROS scavenging,
we found that RIPK3 deficiency did not affect complex IIb

assembly (Figure 7h), suggesting a role for RIPK3 in
TNF-mediated RIPK1-dependent apoptosis downstream of
complex IIb assembly, possibly via ROS generation.
Together, our data therefore demonstrate that ROS
production is required upstream and possibly downstream of
complex IIb assembly for full caspase-8 activation, and that
RIPK3 only contributes to TNF-mediated RIPK1-dependent
apoptosis downstream of complex IIb assembly, possibly via
ROS generation (Figure 8).
Discussion
Depending on the cellular context, TNF can induce RIPK1-
independent or -dependent apoptosis by assembly of two
different cytosolic death complexes, respectively, complex IIa
or IIb.11 RIPK1-independent apoptosis is classically obtained
by the addition of transcriptional or translational inhibitors,
whereas RIPK1-dependent apoptosis is mostly observed in
conditions of cIAP1/2 depletion, obtained either by the use
of SM or more physiologically after stimulation with TWEAK,
which induces cIAP1/2 degradation upon binding to its
cognate receptor Fn14.12,15,17,21,41 As both approaches
interfere with the canonical NF-kB-mediated pro-survival
response, it is believed that the decision to undergo either
complex IIa or IIb apoptosis is regulated at a different level.
For instance, the Ub chains conjugated to RIPK1 by cIAP1/2
at the receptor complex I are thought to constitute the decisive
factor preventing RIPK1 from integrating complex II and
limiting its contribution to the apoptotic dismantlement of the
cell.23 cIAP1/2-mediated ubiquitylation of RIPK1, and
potentially of other proteins within complex I, provides docking
sites for the recruitment of the TAB-TAK1 complex.15,18,42
Here, we show that inhibition of TAK1 kinase activity triggers
TNF-mediated complex IIb-dependent apoptosis indepen￾dently of NF-kB and without affecting ubiquitylation of RIPK1

TAK1 to the Ub chains, and not the Ub chains themselves,

repression only provided protection to TNF-mediated death in
conditions affecting RIPK1 ubiquitylation in complex I, and not
upon TAK1 kinase inhibition, supporting a role for TAK1
downstream of RIPK1 ubiquitylation in this early NF-kB￾independent cell death checkpoint. Further investigation is
needed to understand how TAK1 regulates the death potential
of RIPK1, but it is tempting to speculate that TAK1, either
directly or indirectly, negatively regulates RIPK1 kinase
activity at the level of complex I. Indeed, we found that
TNF-mediated RIPK1-dependent apoptosis relies on RIPK1
activity, and previously reported that the sensitization of L929
cells to TNF-induced necroptosis upon TAK1 kinase inhibition
was associated with enhanced RIPK1 kinase activity.40
Interestingly, it was recently reported that NEMO also
negatively regulates TNF-mediated RIPK1-dependent apop￾tosis and necroptosis independently of NF-kB.43,44 Whether
TAK1 and NEMO collaborate in the early NF-kB-independent
cell death checkpoint downstream of TNFR1 by regulating
RIPK1 kinase activity is an interesting possibility that will
deserve future attention.
The interest for necroptosis has grown dramatically over the
past few years, mainly due to recent studies demonstrating its
importance under physiological and pathological conditions.24
Although the molecular mechanisms regulating necroptosis
are not yet fully understood, it is well established that the
kinase activities of both RIPK1 and RIPK3, and the physical
interaction between these two kinases, are crucial steps in
mediating this type of cell death. As a consequence, the
inhibition of RIPK1 kinase activity by Nec-1 and the repression
of RIPK3 levels, either by genetically or by RNA interference,
have become commonly used approaches to estimate
the contribution of necroptosis both in vitro and in vivo.
29,45
The results presented in this study, however, demonstrate
that none of these two approaches is an absolute tool to
characterize necroptosis, as both RIPK1 kinase activity and
RIPK3 are also required for TNF-mediated apoptosis under
TNF þ SM or TNF þ TAK1i treatment. In line with this, our
results demonstrate that ROS generation is not only required
for TNF-mediated necroptosis,40 as in this study ROS
scavenging also inhibited caspase activation and
complex IIb assembly upon TNF stimulation. The fact that
RIPK3 deficiency affects the extent of caspase-8 activation
and ROS levels without disturbing complex IIb assembly itself
suggests the involvement of ROS both upstream and down￾stream of complex IIb, with RIPK3 only contributing to ROS
generation downstream of complex IIb. The idea that RIPK3
contributes to apoptosis independently of RIPK1 binding is
supported by the results from our reconstitution experiment, in
which both WT RIPK3 and the RHIM mutant similarly rescued
caspase activation upon TNF þ SM or TNF þ TAK1i
treatment. In addition, a RIPK1-independent role of RIPK3 in
ROS-mediated caspase-8 activation has also recently been
reported for inflammasome activation.39 In the context
of necroptosis, two recent studies provided a potential link

between RIPK3 and mitochondrial ROS production that
involves binding of RIPK3, and not RIPK1, to MLKL.46,47
However, MLKL probably does not fulfill this function under
the apoptotic conditions studied here, as the interaction
between RIPK3 and MLKL was shown to depend on RIPK3
kinase activity and our results show that the KD mutant of
RIPK3 also recapitulate the sensitivity to TNF-induced
apoptosis. Our results on the kinase-independent role of
RIPK3 in TNF-mediated apoptosis are in line with early work
reporting apoptosis induction upon ectopic expression of KD
RIPK3 mutants.37,48 It was also previously reported that
RIPK3 could, directly or indirectly, interact with the prodomain
of caspase-8 upon ectopic expression.37 It is therefore
possible that the contribution of RIPK3 to TNF-mediated
apoptosis involves another mechanism than ROS production.
Further studies are therefore required to better understand the
scaffolding role of RIPK3 in TNF-induced RIPK1-dependent
apoptosis and to decipher the link between RIPK3, ROS and
caspase-8 under these apoptotic conditions.
Our results demonstrate that, in addition to its
well-established role in necroptosis, RIPK3 contributes to
TNF-induced RIPK1-dependent apoptosis in a way that does
not require its intact RHIM domain and its kinase activity. Our
work therefore opens doors for the re-interpretation of the
specific necroptotic phenotypes reported in previous studies
on RIPK3. This study also highlights the need to identify new
molecules, or molecular mechanisms, to specifically interfere
with necroptosis induction. Importantly, as RIPK3 kinase
activity and the RHIM domain are required for necroptosis but
dispensable for apoptosis induced by TNF þ SM and
TNF þ TAKi, the development of specific RIPK3 kinase
inhibitors or small molecules that prevent homotypic RHIM
domain interactions remain an interesting future challenge
to specifically inhibit necroptosis. In line with this, the
development of a RIPK3 kinase-dead knock-in mouse line
will be of great value to estimate the relative contribution
of RIPK3-dependent necroptosis versus apoptosis in
physiological and pathological conditions.
Materials and Methods
Plasmids. The sequences encoding WT Ripk3 and the mutated versions of
Ripk3 were cloned into pENTR3C using the cloneEZ pcr cloning kit (GenScript,
Piscataway, NJ, USA). Next, these sequences were transferred into a modified
pLenti6-V5-puromycin destination vector using the LR gateway recombination
system (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The KD contains the K51A
substitution. The RHIM domain mutant was generated by mutating the four
consecutive amino acids QIGN (449–451) into AAAA.
Cell lines. SV40 large T-immortalized Ripk1 þ / þ , Ripk1  /  , Ripk3 þ / þ and
Ripk3  /  MEFs have previously been described.49 Primary Ripk3 þ / þ
and Ripk3  /  MEFs were isolated from E12.5 littermate embryos following
standard protocol. The Tak1 þ / þ and Tak1  /  MEFs were kindly provided by
Dr. Takeuchi.30 The MEFs and HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin
(100 IU/ml), streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml), L-glutamine (200 mM) and sodium pyruvate
(400 mM). Reconstitution of the Ripk3  /  MEFs was done by lentiviral
transduction. 1  106 HEK293T cells were transfected using calcium phosphate
with the empty pLenti6-V5-puromycin plasmid or with the plasmids containing the
different versions of Ripk3 in combination with pCAGGS-CrmA and the lentiviral
packaging vectors pMD2-VSVG and pCMV-DR8.91. The medium was changed
after 6 h, and sample was collected 48 h post transfection. The virus-containing
supernatant was then used to infect the Ripk3  /  MEFs. The infected MEFs
were then selected for 4 days by adding 2.5 mg/ml puromycin to the medium.
Control retroviral pLXSN vector and pLXSN-IkBaSR vector were used to infect
immortalized wt MEFs. Stable control and IkBaSR-expressing cells were obtained
through selection with G418 at 0.5 mg/ml for 1 week.
Antibodies, cytokines and reagents. Antibodies were purchased from
the following companies:
Anti-RIP1 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA, #610459), anti-RIP3 (Sigma￾Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA, #R4277), anti-caspase-8 (Enzo Life Sciences Inc.,
Farmingdale, NY, USA, #ALX-804-447), anti-caspase-8 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA,
USA, #9429), anti-caspase 3 (Cell Signaling, #9662), anti-b tubulin (Abcam,
Cambridge, UK, #ab6046-200), anti-cleaved PARP (Asp214; Cell Signaling,
#9544S). The anti-cIAP1 antibody was a kind gift from Professor Silke (University
of Melbourne).34 Recombinant human TNF-a, produced and purified to at least 99%
homogeneity in our laboratory, has a specific biological activity of 3  107 IU/mg and
was used at 600 IU/ml (20 ng/ml) to stimulate MEFs. Recombinant FLAG-hTNF-a was
purchased from VIB Protein Service Facility (Ghent, Belgium) and was used at
1.5 mg/ml. The general protein translation inhibitor CHX (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as
0.25 mg/ml (Figure 1c) and 5 mg/ml (Figure 3a). Nec-1 (Calbiochem, Merck KGaA,
Darmstadt, Germany) was used at 10 mM. The TAK1 kinase inhibitor, NP-009245
(AnalytiCon Discovery GmbH, Potsdam, Germany), a derivative of (5Z)-7-Oxozeaenol,
was used at 1 mM. The caspase peptide inhibitor, zVAD-fmk (Bachem, Bubendorf,
Switzerland), was used at 20 mM. Compound A (TetraLogic Pharmaceuticals Inc.,
Malvern, PA, USA) was used at 500 nM. BHA (Sigma-Aldrich) was used at 100 mM.
N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (Sigma-Aldrich) was used at 5 mM.
Analysis of cell death and caspase-3 activity using the
Fluostar Omega fluorescence plate reader (BMG Labtech GmbH,
Ortenberg, Germany). MEFs were seeded at least in triplicate at 7500 cells
per well in a 96-well adherent plate using L15 medium (Leibovitz medium) or DMEM.
The next day, the cells were pre-treated with the indicated compounds for 30 min
and then stimulated with hTNF (600 IU/ml) in the presence of 5 mM SytoxGreen
(Life Technologies) and 20 mM DEVD-AMC (PeptaNova GmbH, Sandhausen,
Germany). SytoxGreen and DEVD-AMC fluorescence intensity were measured in
Figure 8 Model for the two cell death checkpoints in TNF-induced apoptosis.
TNF stimulation leads to the assembly of the plasma membrane TNFR1 complex I.
Within this complex, RIPK1 is rapidly conjugated with Ub chains. These Ub chains
act as scaffolds for the recruitment and activation of the TAB2/3-TAK1 complex and
the IKK complex, which subsequently leads to the activation of the canonical NF-kB
signaling pathways that drive transcription of genes that prevent cell death — the
first cell death checkpoint (1). Accordingly, when the NF-kB response is inhibited,
either genetically or by the use of the general translation inhibitor cycloheximide
(CHX), TNFR1 ligation switches from a pro-survival to a RIPK1-independent
pro-apoptotic response by assembly of the cytoplasmic TNFR1 complex IIa. In
addition to its role in NF-kB activation, TAK1 regulates a second cell death
checkpoint at the level of complex I that prevents RIPK1 from integrating the death
complex (2). Indeed, when TAK1 activity in complex I is affected, either indirectly by
avoiding TAK1 recruitment through the use of Smac Mimetics (SM) — which affects
RIPK1 ubiquitylation — or directly by inhibiting its kinase activity (TAK1i), TNF
stimulation induces RIPK1 kinase-dependent apoptosis by assembly of the cytosolic
death complex IIb. Because CYLD acts upstream of TAK1 recruitment, its
repression does not protect cells from apoptosis induced by TAK1 kinase inhibition.
RIPK3 contributes to full caspase-8 activation by acting downstream of complex IIb,
in a kinase and intact RHIM-independent manner. ROS regulates TNF-induced
RIPK1-dependent caspase activation by acting upstream of complex IIb assembly,
and possibly also downstream of complex IIb via RIPK3

function of the time at intervals of 1 h by using a Fluostar Omega fluorescence
plate reader, with excitation/emission filters of 485/520 nm for SytoxGreen and
360/460 nm for DEVD-AMC. The gains set at 1100, 20 flashes per well were taken,
with orbital averaging with a diameter of 3 mm. Cell death was calculated by
subtracting the induced SytoxGreen fluorescence from the background fluorescence
and by dividing the obtained result by the maximal fluorescence (minus the
background fluorescence) obtained by permeabilization of the cells using Triton
X-100 at a final concentration of 0.1%. The caspase-3 activity was calculated by
subtracting the induced DEVD-AMC fluorescence from the background fluorescence
and by dividing the obtained result with the SytoxGreen fluorescence obtained from
the Triton X-100 permeabilized cells, which served to normalized the value to the
amount of cells seeded. All experiments were performed at least twice in triplicates.
Validation of the system is presented in Supplementary Figure S3.
Intracellular ROS measurement. MEFs were seeded in triplicate at
3 105 cells/well (six-well plate). The next day, the cells were pre-treated with TAK1
kinase inhibitor for 30 min and stimulated with hTNF for an additional 3 h. In the last
30 min of incubation at 37 1C, the cells were supplemented with dihydrorodamine
123 (DHR123). Following treatment, the cells were trypsinized and re-suspended in
1 ml of PI-containing medium. Cellular ROS production was determined by
measuring the conversion of DHR123 to R123 by flow cytometry on a triple-laser
(405, 488 and 635 nm) LSR-II using the FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences). Only
viable cells (PI negative) were gated for the analysis of ROS production. ROS
measurement was performed twice in triplicate.
Immunoprecipitation. MEFs were seeded at 2  106 cells/10 cm plate the
day before stimulation. After treatment with the indicated triggers, MEFs were
washed with PBS and lysed in NP-40 lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 10%
glycerol, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8) supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor
cocktail tablets (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland, #11873580001) and
phosphatase inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche Diagnostics, #04906837001). For
TNFR1 complex I immunoprecipitation (5 min post stimulation), TNFRI bound to
human recombinant FLAG-hTNF was immunoprecipitated overnight using anti-FLAG
M2 affinity gel (Sigma-Aldrich). For TNFR1 complex II immunoprecipitation (2 h post
stimulation), endogenous caspase-8 was immunoprecipitated overnight using anti￾caspase-8-coupled protein A beads. For immunoprecipitation of processed caspase￾8, MEFs were first pre-treated with biotin-IETD-fmk (MBL International, Woburn,
MA, USA, #JM-1121-20C) for 30 min and then stimulated with hTNF and SM
for an additional 3.5 h. The cells were then washed with PBS, lysed and
processed caspase-8 bound to biotin-IETD-fmk was immunoprecipitated
overnight using streptavidin beads (Life Technologies, #S59G). After all immunopre￾cipitations, the beads were washed three times in NP-40 lysis buffer and the
immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by adding 60 ml of 2  Laemmli buffer
to the beads. Complexes were subsequently analyzed by immunoblotting
(20 ml/lane).
RNAi-mediated knockdown. 1  106 MEF cells were seeded in a 75-cm2
flask and transfected the next day according to the manufacturer’s protocol using
25 nM siRNA-targeting CYLD or 25 nM siCONTROL non-targeting siRNA
(ON-TARGETplus SMART pool siRNA; Dharmacon, Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA, USA). After 48 h, the cells were trypsinized and seeded. The next
day, the cells were stimulated with hTNF and cell death or recruitment of RIPK1 to
caspase-8 was determined as described above. Knockdown efficiency was tested
by immunoblotting. To achieve a stable miRNA-mediated knockdown of RIPK1
and RIPK3 in the immortalized Ripk1 þ / þ MEFs, oligos against the 30
UTR of
RIPK1 and RIPK3 were cloned into BLOCK-iT HiPerform Lentiviral Pol II miR
RNAi Expression System with EmGFP (Life Technologies) and subsequently
cloned into the pLenti6.2-V5 destination vector (Life Technologies) by the gateway
system. These miRNA-containing plasmids were introduced into immortalized
Ripk1 þ / þ MEFs by lentiviral transduction as described above.
