Abstract
Background: AKI is common following liver transplantation and is associated with significant morbidity and
mortality. Biomarkers of AKI have not been well established in this setting but are needed to help guide patient
care and facilitate development of novel therapeutics.
Methods: Serum creatinine, cystatin C, IL-6, and IL-8 and urine IL-18, NGAL, IL-6, and IL-8 were measured before
and within 24 hours after liver transplantation in 40 patients. AKI was defined as a ≥50% sustained increase in
creatinine above pre-operative values occurring within 24 hours of transplantation and persisting for at least 24
hours.
Results: Seven patients met criteria for AKI (17.5%), with mean creatinines of 0.81 mg/dL pre-operatively and 1.75
mg/dL post-operatively. While pre-operative biomarker levels in patients with AKI were similar to those in patients
without AKI, differences were seen between the groups with regard to median post-operative serum IL-8 (pg/mL)
(242.48 vs. 82.37, p = 0.0463) and urine NGAL (ng/mL) (386.86 vs. 24.31, p = 0.0039), IL-6 (pg/mL) (52 vs. 7.29,
p=0.0532), IL-8 (pg/mL) (14.3 vs. 0, p = 0.0224), and IL-18 (pg/mL) (883.09 vs. 0, p = 0.0449). The areas under
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were 0.749 for urine IL-18, 0.833 for urine NGAL, 0.745 for urine IL-6,
0.682 for serum IL-6, 0.773 for urine IL-8, and 0.742 for serum IL-8. Post-operative cystatin C was not significantly
different between AKI and no AKI groups.
Conclusion: Serum IL-8 and urine IL-18, NGAL, IL-6, and IL-8 are elevated in AKI within the first 24 hours following
liver transplantation.

Background
Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is the definitive
treatment for end-stage liver disease (ESLD), but the
procedure has a significant morbidity and mortality. One
of the most significant complications of OLT is AKI,
which has been reported in 17 to 95% of OLT patients
depending on the definition of AKI [1]. The incidence of
AKI was 78% when defined as an increase in serum
creatinine of greater than 0.5 mg/dL, 46% when defined
as an increase in serum creatinine of greater than 1.0
mg/dL and 14% when defined as an increase in serum
creatinine of greater than 50% above 2.0 mg/dL [1]. A
variety of etiologies can underlie the renal dysfunction in
this setting, including pre-operative hepatorenal physi￾ology, intra-operative vascular clamping that interferes
with renal blood flow, peri-operative hypotension and
vasopressor requirement, and post-operative use of
nephrotoxic medications such as calcineurin inhibitors
[2]. These myriad of factors contribute to a high
incidence of AKI immediately after liver transplantation,
and the development of AKI has been associated
with increased length of hospital stay, morbidity, and
mortality [1,3-6].

Given the unfavorable outcomes associated with AKI
(in the setting of OLT and otherwise), there has been
considerable interest in developing therapies to improve
renal dysfunction. However, interventional approaches
have been limited by the shortcomings of the conven￾tional approach to the diagnosis of AKI. Measurement
of serum creatinine remains the commonest diagnostic
tool for assessment of renal function, but this long-used
marker suffers from its insensitivity to small changes in
renal function, its lack of specificity for renal function
given the influence exerted by a variety of non-renal
factors (such as muscle mass and diet), and its long
lag-time in response respond to kidney injury. These
problems can be particularly pronounced in the setting of
ESLD, where creatinine has been shown to be an especially
unreliable marker of renal function [7]. The inadequacies of
creatinine-based estimates of renal function have probably
limited the success of AKI therapeutic trials and the
opportunity to change the therapeutic strategy accordingly
(e.g., delaying the initiation of nephrotoxic immunosup￾pression after transplant in patients with AKI). A new class
of molecular biomarkers has shown significant promise in
other clinical settings. These biomarkers include serum
cystatin C, urine IL-6, serum IL-6, urine IL-18, and urinary
neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL). These
molecules have been shown to be early detectors of AKI in
a variety of clinical settings such as critical illness, [8-10]
after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, [11,12] in heart
failure, [13] and with contrast-induced kidney injury[14].
However, the role of biomarkers for detection of AKI
in patients undergoing OLT has been explored in only a
few prior studies that were limited to urinary and serum
NGAL levels [15-18]. Urinary NGAL and L-FABP have
recently been described as biomarkers of early AKI after
liver transplantation [19]. Besides NGAL and L-FABP,
there have been no reports of using other established
AKI biomarkers in OLT patients, in whom the levels of
these molecules could be altered by factors unrelated to
kidney function. Therefore, in this study, we examined a
wider panel of biomarkers of AKI in patients undergoing
OLT, with the hypothesis that post-operative biomarkers
would be higher in patients who develop AKI than in
those who do not.
Methods
Patients
All patients aged 18 to 90 years old who underwent a
first-time OLT at the University of Colorado (N=11) and
University of Washington (N=29) were eligible for the
study. Patients were excluded if they were pregnant,
incarcerated, unable to provide consent, received dialysis
before or during OLT, or received a kidney transplant
simultaneously with their liver, had pre-renal AKI (a more
than 50% rise in serum creatinine that was not sustained
for 24 hours). All the patients received either tacrolimus
or cyclosporine as immunosuppressive therapy. All study
enrollment procedures and subsequent data collection
and acquisition was approved by the Colorado Multiple
Institutional Review Board. All eligible patients who were
consented according to proper procedures in a consecutive
fashion over an 18 month period were enrolled at the
2 hospitals.
Sample collection and processing
Pre-operative blood and urine samples (four and ten
milliliters, respectively) were collected from each patient
within 24 hours of OLT. Additional samples of the same
volumes were collected within 24 hours after OLT
(measured from the time of surgical incision, blood
samples were collected an average of 21 hours and 41
minutes later and urine samples were collected an average
of 21 hours and 38 minutes later. Average time point
between surgical incision and time to first blood sample
was 21 hours and 21 minutes in the AKI group.
Collected urine was centrifuged at 5000G for two minutes,
and the supernatant liquid was stored at −80°C. Blood
samples were centrifuged at 3500 RPM for ten minutes,
and serum was stored at −80°C.
Biomarkers were measured on single, not pooled
samples. Serum cystatin C levels were measured using an
immunonephelometric method (Dade Behring, Marburg,
Germany), and a standard calibration formula was used to
estimate glomerular filtration rate from the result [20].
Urine IL-18 levels were measured with a specific enzyme￾linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Medical and
Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan) that specifically
detects the mature form of IL-18 as previously described
[10]. All measurements were made in a blinded fashion.
The inter- and intra-assay coefficient variations were
5–10%, corresponding to that reported by the kit manufac￾turer. Urine NGAL levels were measured using a commer￾cially available ELISA (Bioporto, Gentofte, Denmark) as
published previously [11]. Briefly, microtiter plates pre￾coated with a mouse monoclonal antibody raised against
human NGAL (HYB211–05, AntibodyShop, Gentofte,
Denmark) were blocked with buffer containing 1% BSA,
coated with 100 μL of samples (urine) or standards
(NGAL concentrations ranging from 1–1000 ng/mL), and
incubated with a biotinylated monoclonal antibody against
human NGAL (HYB211–01B, AntibodyShop) followed by
avidin-conjugated HRP (Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA).
TMB substrate (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) was
added for color development, which was read after 30 min
at 450 nm with a microplate reader (Benchmark Plus,
BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). The intra- and inter-assay
coefficients of variability (CVs) were 5.6% and 6.4%,
respectively. Serum and urine IL-6 and IL-8 levels were
measured using an ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
Sirota et al. BMC Nephrology 2013, 14:17 Page 2 of 9
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2369/14/17

MN). Briefly, the IL-6 and IL-8 assays employ the quanti￾tative sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique. A
monoclonal antibody specific for IL-6 or IL-8 has been
pre-coated onto a microplate. Standards and samples are
pipetted into the wells and any IL-6 or IL-8 present is
bound by the immobilized antibody. After washing away
any unbound substances, an enzyme-linked polyclonal
antibody specific for IL-6 or IL-8 is added to the wells.
Following a wash to remove any unbound antibody￾enzyme reagent, a substrate solution is added to the wells
and color develops in proportion to the amount of IL-6
bound in the initial step. The color development is
stopped and the intensity of the color is measured.
Serum creatinine levels were measured daily by the
hospital’s central laboratory as part of routine peri￾operative care, and these values were recorded. A com￾bination of retrospective and prospective chart reviews
was performed to collect demographic and pertinent
clinical data. AKI was defined as an increase in serum
creatinine by 50% or greater compared to pre-operative
values that occurred within 24 hours of OLT and that
was sustained for at least 24 hours. Patients who
developed a 50% rise in serum creatinine that was not
sustained for 24 hours were removed from analysis as
their kidney injury was thought to be pre-renal in nature.
The definition of AKI was based on the Risk, Injury,
Failure; Loss, End-Stage Renal Disease (RIFLE) classi￾fication and Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN)
classification where Risk or AKIN stage 1 represents an
increase of serum creatinine to 1.5 times baseline [21]. In
a separate analysis, biomarkers were compared in patients
with or without AKI as defined by a >50% increase in
serum cystatin C level at 24 hours.
Statistics
Demographic data was compared between patients who
developed AKI and those who did not using either the
Fisher’s exact test or the unpaired t test. Two-tailed
p-values are presented. Mean and standard deviation
calculations were performed for the measured levels of
serum creatinine and serum cystatin C. Mean pre-operative
values were compared to mean post-operative values
among patients who developed AKI and separately among
patients who did not develop AKI using two-tailed paired
t tests. At each of the two timepoints (pre-operative and
post-operative), mean creatinine and cystatin C values
among patients who developed AKI were compared to
those in patients who did not develop AKI using two-tailed
unpaired t tests. For serum and urinary biomarkers, med￾ians and interquartile ranges were calculated, and median
values of the AKI group were compared to those of the no
AKI group using the Mann–Whitney test with two-tailed
p-values. We defined statistical significance as a p-value of
<0.05. InStat software was used for statistical analysis.
Results
Table 1 shows the demographic information and clinical
characteristics of patients who underwent liver trans￾plantation in this study. Seven patients met the criteria
for AKI (“AKI group”) and 33 did not (“no AKI group”).
The mean age of patients who developed AKI was 58.9
years, compared to 55.6 years in patients who did not
develop AKI. The AKI group was 55.6% male and
88.9% Caucasian, compared to 64.7% male and 82.4%
Caucasian in the group without AKI. The two patient
groups had statistically similar prevalences of hypertension
and diabetes mellitus (44.4% vs. 23.5% for hypertension in
the AKI vs. no AKI groups, respectively; 22.2% vs. 26.5%
for diabetes mellitus in the AKI vs. no AKI groups, respect￾ively), and they had similar baseline serum creatinine values
(0.89 vs. 1.07 mg/dL), which were determined from mean
serum creatinine values obtained within three months prior
to transplant. Additionally, there was no statistically signifi￾cant difference in the two groups with regard to average
duration of end-stage liver disease prior to transplant (75.4
vs. 99.2 months), pre-operative Model for End Stage Liver
Disease (MELD) scores (16.3 vs. 18.6), or prevalences of
viral or alcoholic etiologies for their cirrhosis. Duration of
surgery was longer in the AKI group compared to the no
AKI group (Table 1). There was no difference in AST, ALT,
alkaline phosphatase, albumin or bilirubin pre-operatively
between AKI and non AKI patients. AST (U/L) was 84 in
the AKI group and 95 in the non-AKI group (P=NS). ALT
(U/L) was 43 in the AKI group and 68 in the non-AKI
group (P=NS). Alkaline phosphatase (U/L) was 130 in the

AKI group and 135 in the non-AKI group (P=NS). Serum
albumin (g/dL) was 3.15 in the AKI group and 3.08 in the
non-AKI group (P=NS). Bilirubin (mg/dL) was 2.4 in the
AKI group and 3.6 in the non-AKI group (P=NS).
Table 2 shows mean creatinine values for the AKI and
no AKI groups. The mean serum creatinine measured
within 24 hours prior to liver transplant was 0.81 mg/dL in
patients who subsequently developed AKI, as manifested
by a mean post-operative serum creatinine of 1.75 mg/dL.
This increase was statistically significant (p = 0.0002).
In contrast, patients in the no AKI group had a mean
pre-operative serum creatinine value of 1.13 mg/dL,
and post-operatively their mean serum creatinine was
1.21 mg/dL. This change in serum creatinine was not
statistically significant (p = 0.0809). As expected, the AKI
group’s mean post-operative creatinine was signifi￾cantly higher than that of the group without AKI (1.75 vs.
1.21 mg/dL, p = 0.0005). A statistically significant difference
between the AKI and no AKI group was also seen with
regard to mean pre-operative creatinine as well (0.81 vs.
1.13 mg/dL, p = 0.0131). Median values for pre-operative
creatinine were 0.80 mg/dL for the AKI group and
1.10 mg/dL for the no AKI group; median post-operative
values were 1.8 mg/dL and 1.2 mg/dL, respectively.
To determine whether low albumin or systemic
inflammation contributed to the lower pre-operative
creatinine in the AKI group, serum albumin and serum
IL-6 was compared between the AKI and no AKI
groups. There was no difference in serum albumin or
serum IL-6 pre-op between the AKI and no AKI groups
suggesting that malnutrition or systemic inflammation is
not the cause of the lower serum creatinine in the AKI
group: Serum albumin (g/dL) pre-op was 3.15 in the
AKI group and 3.08 in the non-AKI group (P=NS).
Serum IL-6 (pg/mL) pre-op was 20.2 in the AKI group
and 15.0 in the non-AKI group (P=NS).
Table 2 also shows the mean serum cystatin C values
for the two groups before and after liver transplantation.
Patients who developed AKI had a mean pre-operative
cystatin C value of 0.94 mg/L, compared to the no AKI
group’s mean value of 1.16 mg/L (p = 0.1674). These
two groups did not have a statistically significant
difference in their post-operative mean cystatin C values
(1.33 for the AKI group vs. 1.19 mg/dL for the no AKI
group, p = 0.4236). While the AKI group did have a
substantial increase in serum cystatin C value (0.94 mg/L
pre-operatively, 1.33 mg/L post-operatively), the increase
failed to reach statistical significance (p = 0.0812). The
change in serum cystatin C level amongst the no AKI
patient group was small and not statistically significant
(1.16 mg/L pre-operatively, 1.19 mg/L post-operatively; p
= 0.6325). Median values for pre-operative cystatin C were
0.94 mg/L for the AKI group and 1.19 mg/L for the no
AKI group; median post-operative values were 1.36 mg/L
and 1.16 mg/L, respectively.
Table 3 shows median pre-operative and post-operative
biomarker levels in patients who developed AKI and those
who did not. On average, urine and serum biomarkers
were collected less than 22 hours after surgical incision
(1298 minutes for urine samples, 1301 minutes for blood).
All pre-operative biomarker levels were statistically similar
when comparing AKI and no AKI groups (p-values
ranging from 0.1577 to 0.6693). When comparing post￾operative biomarker levels in patients with AKI to those
without AKI, statistically significant differences were seen
in urine IL-18 (pg/mL) (883.09 vs. 0, p = 0.0449), urine
NGAL (ng/mL) (386.86 vs. 24.31, p = 0.0039), urine IL-8
(pg/mL) (14.3 vs. 0, p=0.0224) and serum IL-8 (pg/mL)
(242.48 vs. 82.37, p = 0.0463). A trend towards significant
difference was seen for urine IL-6 (pg/mL) (52.00 vs. 7.29
in the AKI and no AKI groups, respectively, p = 0.0532).
The difference between serum IL-6 values in the two
groups was different (44.76 vs. 18.75), but the p-value did
not reach statistical significance (p = 0.1025).
The absolute change in serum creatinine (mg/dl) from
pre-operative to 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hrs post￾operative in AKI patients is shown in Table 4. In 3 of
the 7 AKI patients the serum creatinine continued to
rise at 48 hours post-operative. In 4 of the 7 AKI
patients, the serum creatinine remained increased by 0.3
or more at 120 hours post-operative.
Figure 1 shows receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curves for the post-operative biomarker levels. The area
under the curve (AUC) for each of the ROC curves is
the following: 0.749 for urine IL-18, 0.833 for urine
NGAL, 0.745 for urine IL-6, 0.682 for serum IL-6, 0.773
for urine IL-8, and 0.742 for serum IL-8.
Finally, we repeated the biomarker analysis using a
different definition of AKI. Seven patients met the
criteria of AKI as defined by a >50% increase in serum
cystatin C level at 24 hours. These seven patients had no
statistical differences from the non-AKI patients in
terms of age, sex, race, pre-operative MELD score, or
baseline serum creatinine level, or pre-operative serum
creatinine level. As shown in Table 5, all pre-operative
biomarker levels were found to be statistically similar

between AKI and non-AKI groups, but post-operative
urine NGAL, IL-6, and IL-8 levels in the AKI group
were all found to be higher (with statistical significance)
when compared to the non-AKI group.
Discussion
In this study, we sought to evaluate the performance of
a variety of biomarkers of AKI in the setting of OLT
when examined within 24 hours of surgery. We used
serum creatinine in our definition of AKI because of its
prominence in standard AKI definitions and because
data on the superiority of cystatin C in the setting of
OLT is conflicting. Some studies have shown that cysta￾tin C may be a better assay for GFR estimation in the
setting of cirrhosis [22] and a 2006 study showed that
serum cystatin C correlated better with iohexol-based
GFR estimates than serum creatinine did [23]. However,
a subsequent study in 2009 did not demonstrate
improved diagnostic accuracy of cystatin C over serum
creatinine in the setting of liver transplantation [24].
Serum cystatin C has been shown to be superior to
creatinine as a marker of kidney function in chronic
kidney disease [25]. Therefore, we chose to use serum
creatinine in our AKI definition despite its limitations.
As established by our definition, post-operative serum
creatinine levels were higher in the AKI group than in
the non-AKI group. Interestingly, however, we found that
pre-operative serum creatinine levels were significantly
lower in the AKI group than in the non-AKI group.
A similar pattern was seen with respect to cystatin C
(although the difference in pre-operative cystatin C levels
failed to achieve statistical significance). While these differ￾ences were not expected, they supported the notion that
AKI patients did not harbor any manifest renal dysfunction
prior to transplantation, and the similarities seen in the
pre-operative biomarker levels between the groups further
supports this hypothesis.
Using serum creatinine elevations to define AKI, we
found statistically significant elevations in post-operative
urine IL-18, urine NGAL, urine IL-8, and serum IL-8 in
patients with AKI compared to those without AKI, and

patients despite failing to achieve statistical significance.
ROC curve analysis showed that urine NGAL had the
best diagnostic performance and that the IL-6 measures
performed the worst amongst those we tested. We also
examined the biomarkers using an alternative, cystatin
C-based definition of AKI. With AKI defined as a >50%
increase in serum cystatin C levels at 24 hours, we found
that post-operative urine NGAL, IL-6, and IL-8 levels
were all significantly elevated above non-AKI controls.
We did not normalize urinary biomarker concentrations
to contemporaneous urine creatinine concentration
because urinary creatinine excretion in the setting of
AKI is dynamic and its inclusion in the assessment of
urinary biomarkers has been challenged [26].
While a few previous reports have documented eleva￾tions in NGAL levels in post-liver transplant patients
who develop AKI, the utility of other biomarkers that
have been proven indicators of AKI has not yet been
established in the setting of OLT. In 2009, Niemann
et al. evaluated plasma NGAL levels in 59 patients
undergoing OLT and found that elevations in NGAL
levels measured two hours after reperfusion was predictive
of AKI [17]. Among those patients with pre-operative
serum creatinine levels of <1.5 mg/dL, plasma NGAL level
at two hours post-perfusion was associated with the
subsequent development of AKI. The following year,
Portal et al. evaluated both urinary and serum NGAL
levels in 95 patients undergoing OLT and found that post￾operative serum NGAL (but not urinary NGAL) was a
predictor of severe AKI in multiple logistic regression
analysis [18]. In 2011, Wagener et al. examined urinary
NGAL/creatinine ratios in 92 patients undergoing OLT
[15]. Elevations in urinary NGAL/creatinine ratios were
detected three hours after reperfusion and were more pro￾nounced in patients who developed AKI. Urinary NGAL/
creatinine ratios were evaluated again in a recent study by
Jeong et al. [16]. Elevated urinary NGAL/creatinine ratios
were seen two hours after reperfusion in 11 patients who
developed AKI after living-related liver transplantation,
and peak elevation preceded the rise in serum creatinine
in these patients by 19 hours.

Despite this data on NGAL’s role as a predictor of
AKI, other biomarkers have not been evaluated in the
setting of OLT. The need for studying other biomarkers
in AKI is underscored by a closer examination of the
previous studies on urinary NGAL that reveals some
limitations of its diagnostic ability. When ROC curves
were constructed in these prior studies, the AUC’s did
not indicate superior diagnostic capabilities (AUC’s for
urinary NGAL ranged from 0.693 to 0.800). Thus,
urinary NGAL may be an imperfect tool in the early
detection of AKI, and defining the diagnostic charac￾teristics for other biomarkers may prove useful in
designing future studies to determine whether multiple
biomarkers are early predictors of AKI [27].
Our goal was to expand the current panel of biomarkers
that has been studied in the setting of OLT from NGAL
alone to include urine IL-18, serum and urine IL-6, and
serum and urine IL-8. These various biomarkers have been
established in other settings. IL-18, a proinflammatory
cytokine, has been identified as a mediator of ischemic
injury in the kidney and has been demonstrated to be a
reliable marker of and contributor to AKI through animal
studies [28-30]. Further studies have demonstrated its
diagnostic utility in patients with AKI in the setting of
critical illness [10,31] following cardiopulmonary bypass
surgery [12,32-34] and after toxin exposure [14,35] IL-6 is
another pro-inflammatory cytokine that has been shown to
be elevated in animal models of AKI [36] and in humans
with AKI after cardiac surgery [37,38] or with severe sepsis
[39]. IL-8 is an endothelial-derived chemokine involved in
recruiting neutrophils to the site of injury and stimulating
their response. IL-8 levels have been shown to be elevated
in the setting of renal allograft dysfunction [40] and in AKI
associated with cardiopulmonary bypass surgery [41].
It has been reported that worst pre-orthotopic liver
transplant hepatic function is associated with an
increased incidence of post- orthotopic liver transplant
AKI [42,43]. In the present study, there was no differ￾ence in MELD score between AKI and non AKI patients.
Also, there was no difference in pre-operative AST, ALT,
alkaline phosphatase, albumin or bilirubin between AKI
and non AKI patients.
Our study has limitations. First, the overall sample size
was small and the incidence of post-operative AKI was
significantly lower than that reported in the literature,
resulting in a small pool of patients for analysis. This
shortcoming may have diminished our statistical power
and precluded a more robust calculation of our biomar￾kers’ predictive abilities. Second, it is likely that some of
these biomarkers would have been elevated earlier than
24 hours post-operatively. Thus biomarkers that rise
quickly in response to AKI may have already peaked and
began normalizing by the time we measured them at 24
hours post-operatively. The degree of elevation may have
underestimated the peak degree of elevation and thereby
diminished our diagnostic power. Additionally, we may
have missed transient elevations that had fully resolved
by the time we collected our samples. In the present
study, biomarkers were measured at the same time as
serum creatinine and were elevated at the same time as
serum creatinine in AKI patients. Our previous studies
in AKI patients post cardiac surgery demonstrate that
urine IL-18 and NGAL peak at 6 hrs post op [34]. Thus
it is possible that urine IL-18 and NGAL may peak
earlier than serum creatinine and serve as an early
biomarker of AKI post liver transplant. Future studies
will determine whether these biomarkers increase before
serum creatinine in liver transplant patients.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the present study establishes the utility of
measuring a wider selection of cytokines and chemokines
(urine IL-18, urine NGAL, urine IL-8, serum IL-8 and urine
IL-6) as biomarkers of AKI post liver transplantation. The
present study should prompt further research into using
these biomarkers with urine NGAL to detect AKI prior to
randomization to therapeutic strategies in clinical studies.
Given the prevalence of AKI associated with OLT and its
associated morbidity and mortality, therapeutic studies
based on the diagnosis of AKI using a panel of biomarkers
including kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), may be
possible in the future. The development of novel therapies
for AKI may lead to better outcomes.
