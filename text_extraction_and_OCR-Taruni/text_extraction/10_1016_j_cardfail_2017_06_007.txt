Highlights 
 In this cross sectional study, we find decreased serum levels of primary bile acids 
and increased levels of specific secondary bile acids, resulting in increased ratio of 
secondary to primary bile acids in patients with chronic heart failure. 
 The ratio of secondary to primary bile acids was associated with reduced overall 
survival in univariate analysis, but not in multivariate analyses. 
 Although the production of secondary bile acids depends on the gut microbiota, 
several factors affecting the production, regulation and elimination of bile acids 
could contribute to these findings. 
 Future studies should assess the potential role of bile acid composition in patients 
with heart failure, and investigate whether manipulation of factors influencing bile 
acid metabolism, including the intestinal microbial community, could alter clinical 
outcome. 
Abstract 
Aims: Bile acids (BAs) are now recognized as signaling molecules and emerging evidence 
suggests that BAs affect cardiovascular function. The gut microbiota has recently been linked 
to the severity of heart failure (HF), and microbial metabolism has a major impact on BA 
homeostasis. We aimed to investigate the pattern of BAs, and in particular microbiota￾transformed (secondary) BAs, in patients with chronic HF. 
Methods and Results: This was a prospective, observational, single-center study including 
142 patients with chronic HF and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. We 
measured plasma levels of primary, secondary and total BAs, and explored their associations 
with clinical characteristics and survival. Plasma levels of primary BAs were lower (p<0.01) 
and the ratio of secondary to primary BAs was higher (p<0.001) in patients with HF 
compared to controls. Approximately 40% of patients in the upper tertile of the ratio of 
secondary to primary BAs died during 5.6 years of follow-up (unadjusted Cox-regression: 
Page 2 of 25

HR 1.93, 95% Confidence Interval 1.01-3.68 compared to the lower tertiles). However, this 
association was attenuated and no longer significant in multivariate analyses. 
Conclusions: Levels of primary BAs were reduced and specific secondary BAs increased in 
patients with chronic HF. This pattern was associated with reduced overall survival in 
univariate analysis, but not in multivariate analyses. Future studies should assess the 
regulation and potential role of BA metabolism in HF.

Introduction 
Heart failure (HF) is a major public health issue with increasing prevalence due to an aging 
population and improved management of the disease 1
. However, the mortality and morbidity 
of HF are still high, at least partly reflecting the possibility that important pathogenic 
mechanisms are not targeted by the current therapeutic options 2
. Metabolic and 
inflammatory disturbances have been suggested to play a role in the development and 
progression of chronic HF 3
, but these issues remain far from clear. 
Research over the last decades has expanded the traditional view of bile acids (BAs) beyond 
their role in cholesterol elimination and emulsification of dietary fat. BAs are now recognized 
as signaling molecules that interact with both plasma membrane and nuclear receptors, 
exerting regulatory effects on glucose and lipid metabolism 4
, energy homeostasis 5
and other 
physiological processes 6
. We have recently reported decreased ratio of 12α￾hydroxylated/non 12α-hydroxylated BA six months after bariatric surgery 7
, associated with 
an improvement in insulin sensitivity and downregulation of inflammatory responses 8
.
Emerging evidence suggests that BAs may also play a role in regulating cardiovascular 
function. In the heart and systemic circulation, BAs interact with plasma membrane G￾protein coupled receptors, e.g. TGR5, and nuclear receptors, e.g. the farnesoid (FXR) and 
pregnane/steroid and xenobiotic receptors (PXR/SXR) (9). It has been suggested that BAs 
reduce heart rate by regulating channel conductance and calcium dynamics in sino-atrial and 
ventricular cardiomyocytes, and regulate vascular tone via both endothelium-dependent and -
independent mechanisms 10
. Hence, a potential role of BAs in cardiovascular disease has 
been proposed. 
The gastrointestinal tract contains a dynamic microbial community, denoted the gut 
microbiota. Altered gut microbiota has been linked to diseases associated with chronic 
Page 5 of 25

6
systemic inflammation and metabolic disturbances such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus 11
and cardiovascular disease 12. Of note, BA metabolism is tightly connected with the gut 
microbiota. Primary BAs are synthesized in the liver from cholesterol through the classic and 
alternative pathway, involving a variety of different enzymes 13. Before excretion into bile, 
primary BAs are conjugated with either glycine or taurine, rendering the BAs water soluble 
and permitting high concentrations to persist in bile and intestinal content 14. In the gut, 
primary BAs undergo metabolism to secondary BAs by the gut microbiota 15 before 
reabsorption as a part of the enterohepatic cycle. Thus, secondary BAs may also be 
considered microbiota-transformed BAs. 
At present, data on BAs in HF patients are lacking. Given the proposed involvement of 
intestinal dysfunction, microbiota alterations and BAs in cardiovascular diseases16
, we aimed 
to investigate the regulation of BAs in patients with chronic HF and their association with 
disease severity including mortality.

Material and Methods
Patients 
The study population has previously been described in details 17. In brief, a total of 142 
patients with HF for >6 months, stabilized on state-of-art treatment for at least 3 months, 
were consecutively included in a prospective cohort study at the Department of Cardiology, 
Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway (Table 1). These patients had reduced 
systolic function and were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II–IV. 
Patients with acute coronary syndromes during the last six months and patients with 
significant concomitant disease such as infection, malignancy or autoimmune disease were 
excluded. The patients were evaluated by echocardiography. The underlying cause of HF was 
classified as coronary artery disease (CAD, n=66), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM, n=70) or 
other (n=6) on the basis of patient history, echocardiography and coronary angiography. We 
also included 20 sex- and age–matched healthy individuals. The study was approved by the 
by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REK Sør-Øst) and 
conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all 
individuals.
Blood sampling and biochemistry
For measurement of primary BAs, secondary BAs and their conjugated (glycine and taurine) 
fractions, we collected peripheral venous blood in pyrogen-free tubes with EDTA as 
anticoagulant. The samples were non-fasting, drawn after a light, standard Norwegian 
breakfast. The tubes were immediately immersed in melting ice and centrifuged within 30 
minutes at 2,000g for 20 minutes to obtain platelet-poor plasma. All samples were stored at -
80ºC until analysis and thawed <three times. BAs analyses were performed using liquid 
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) by an established in-house assay 18
.

C-Reactive protein (CRP) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) were 
analyzed with the use of the Modular platform (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). 
Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated based on the Cockcroft–Gault 
formula. Plasma levels of LPS were measured with the limulus amoebocyte lysate assay 
(Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA). 
Right-sided heart catheterization 
Right-sided heart catheterization was performed using a Swan–Ganz pulmonary artery 
thermodilution catheter (Baxter Health Care Corp, Santa Ana, CA, USA). Right heart 
haemodynamics were recorded, and cardiac output was measured using the thermodilution 
technique. 
Echocardiography
Echocardiography was performed using Vivid 7 or E9 ultrasound scanners (GE Vingmed 
Ultrasound, Horten, Norway), with phased array transducers. Cine loops were digitally stored 
and analyzed offline using ECHO-PAC software (GE Vingmed Ultrasound). Two￾dimensional parameters and conventional Doppler measurements were recorded according to 
current recommendations. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was measured using 
Simpson’s biplane method. 
Statistical analysis
Differences between groups were analyzed with the use of Student t tests, Mann-Whitney U 
tests, or chi-square tests as appropriate. When comparing ≥3 groups, the Kruskal-Wallis test 
or 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for continuous data, depending on 
distribution (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). Correlations were analyzed with Pearson`s r for 
BA-ratio, whereas individual BAs and sum of primary and secondary BAs were analyzed by 
Page 8 of 25

Spearman`s Rho due to their skewed distribution. Kaplan-Meier analysis with log rank test 
was used to analyze all-cause/anticipated mortality stratified by tertiles of the 
secondary/primary BA ratio. A linear regression model was used to adjust differences in 
secondary/primary BA ratio between patients and controls. Cox proportional hazard analysis 
was performed to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) adjusting for age, renal function and NT-pro 
B-Type Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP). P values are 2-sided and were considered 
significant when <.05. In this exploratory study, adjustments for multiple comparisons were 
not performed.

Results 
Clinical characteristics 
Clinical characteristics are provided in Table 1. The healthy control subjects were matched 
for age and gender, and had no previous MI, hypertension or diabetes, or concurrent 
medication. There were significantly higher eGFR measurements and fewer smokers among 
the controls. Furthermore, there was a tendency to higher BMI in HF patients, although it 
should be noted that BMI was available from only half the control subjects. 
Altered bile acid composition in HF patients 
As shown in Figure 1A and Supplementary Table, levels of primary BAs were significantly 
lower in patients with HF than in controls. This difference was mainly driven by lower levels 
of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDC) and its glycine (GCDC) and taurine (TCDC) conjugates, as 
well as the glycine conjugate of cholic acid (GCA) in patients with HF. 
In the gut, glycine-conjugated and taurine-conjugated BAs are deconjugated by bacterial bile 
salt hydrolases. Primary BAs are subsequently dehydroxylated to secondary BAs by bacterial 
7-alpha-dehydroxylases (i.e., CA is converted to deoxycholic acid (DC) and CDC to 
lithocholic acid [LC]). Reabsorbed BAs are further conjugated to glycine and taurine in the 
liver. Notably, in parallel with the observed reduction in GCDC (and numerically also CDC 
and TCDC), there was an increase in LC (p=0.001) and its conjugates GLC (p<0.001) and 
TLC (p<0.001) in patients with chronic HF. Finally, the glycine conjugate of 
ursodeoxycholic acid (GUDC) was also increased (p=0.001) in these patients (Figure 1A). 
In contrast, the ratio of 12α-hydroxylated BAs to non-12α-hydroxylated BAs (i.e. the 12α￾hydroxylated BAs [CA, deoxycholic acid (DC) and their conjugated forms]/the non-12α￾hydroxylated BA [chenodeoxycholic acid (CDC), lithocholic acid (LC), UDC and their 
Page 10 of 25

11
conjugated forms) was similar in HF patients (ratio 0.69 [0.31, 1.06]) and controls (ratio 0.68 
[0.42, 1.18] p=0.74). 
Increased secondary/primary BA-ratio in chronic heart failure patients 
Our findings so far suggested that in HF, there were decreased levels of primary BAs and 
increased levels of specific secondary BAs. Indeed, the ratio of secondary to primary BAs 
was significantly higher in patients with HF than in healthy control subjects (Figure 1B). 
Adjusting for eGFR and current smoking in a linear regression model, the difference in BA￾ratio between HF patients and controls was still significant (p<0.001). 
There was a higher proportion of patients with hypertension and use of β-blockers with 
higher tertiles of the secondary/primary BA-ratio, but this ratio was not associated with other 
baseline characteristics outlined in Table 1 such as age, renal function, New York Heart 
Association (NYHA) class, LVEF, NT-proBNP or CRP. 
Association between the individual BAs and NT-proBNP as well as potential determinants 
including renal function, liver function, glycemic control and albumin are presented in Table 
2. NT-proBNP correlated positively with the primary BAs TCDC and TCA and negatively 
with the secondary BA DC, but not with total primary or secondary BAs. The secondary BA 
LC was negatively correlated with eGFR. The primary BAs GCA and TCA, as well as total 
primary BAs and the secondary BA GUDC were correlated with ALT. None of the BAs 
were associated with HbA1c. Finally, the taurine-conjugated primary BAs TCDC and TCA 
were negatively correlated with albumin.
Association with pulmonary artery pressure and plasma lipopolysaccharide 
Page 11 of 25

12
Intracardiac pressures obtained from right heart catheterization had a moderate negative 
correlation with the secondary/primary BA-ratio (right atrium pressure, r= -0.27, p= 0.01; 
pulmonary artery mean pressure, r= -0.25, p=0.024; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, r= 
-0.27, p=0.012), whereas no correlations were found with cardiac output (r=0.13, p=0.228)
or pulmonary vascular resistance ( r= -0.12, p= 0.288). Plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide 
had a moderate association with both secondary BAs (r=0.18, p= 0.033) and 
secondary/primary BA-ratio (r= 0.18, p= 0.031).
Association with clinical outcome 
During a median follow-up of 5.6 years (range 0.1 – 7.6 years), 37 patients died. None of the 
primary or secondary BAs per se were associated with mortality in our HF patients (data not 
shown). However, when we compared patients across tertiles of secondary/primary BAs, we 
found a trend (p=0.10) for decreased survival with increasing ratio. 
As depicted in Figure 2, approximately 40% of patients in the upper tertile of 
secondary/primary BA-ratio died during follow- up (unadjusted Cox-regression: Hazard ratio 
(HR) 1.93 [95% Confidence Interval 1.01-3.68], p=0.041). However, this association was 
attenuated and no longer significant after adjustment for age, renal function, hypertension, 
use of beta-blockers and NT-pro-BNP (adjusted HR 1.83 [95% CI 0.91-3.66], p=0.089).

Discussion 
The main findings in this study can be summarized as follows: i) Levels of primary BAs were 
lower and levels of specific secondary BAs were higher in patients with HF than in healthy 
control subjects, resulting in an increased secondary to primary BA ratio in HF, ii) an 
increased ratio of secondary to primary BAs tended to be associated with reduced overall 
survival on univariate analysis, but this association was not significant after adjustment for 
clinical characteristics and NT-proBNP. 
BAs have been shown to have effects on the cardiovascular system including interaction with 
endothelial function, heart rate and various metabolic pathways at least partly involving 
signaling through nuclear and plasma membrane receptors 10. Recently, the effect of 
ursodeoxycholic acid (UDC), a BA used in patients with cholestatic liver diseases, was 
investigated in 16 patients with HF, showing improved markers of liver function as well as 
improved peripheral blood flow 19
. However, data on the composition and homeostasis of 
BAs in HF patients are scarce. 
The present study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to assess a wide range of BAs in 
HF patients, observing reduced levels of multiple primary BAs in HF patients compared with 
healthy controls, while several of the secondary BAs, were higher. Although the formation of 
secondary BAs is dependent on transformation of primary BAs by intestinal bacteria15
, 
several factors could influence the secondary to primary BA ratio. In this context, one could 
argue that our observations are possibly just an epiphenomenon of cardiac congestion that 
affects patients with HF. However, data obtained from right heart catheterization of these 
patients showed a modest negative correlation with pulmonary artery pressures, refuting this 
hypothesis. Furthermore, there was a modest, but positive correlation between plasma levels 
Page 13 of 25

14
of secondary BAs and lipopolysaccharide in the patients, suggesting that an increased 
microbial activity could contribute to some of the observations in this study. 
Although an increased ratio of secondary to primary BAs tended to be associated with 
reduced overall survival in univariate analysis, this association was no longer significant after 
adjustment for NT-proBNP. The negative association between the BA-ratio and pulmonary 
artery pressures further weakens the argument that this ratio has an independent prognostic 
value in HF. However, it should be noted that the current study was an exploratory rather 
than a prognostic study, and larger, independent samples are needed to evaluate secondary to 
primary BAs in relation to clinical end points. 
Individual BAs have highly variable agonist activity and affinity to the proposed target 
receptors in the heart 20 and a reasonable hypothesis is therefore that specific BAs could be 
more distinctly associated with outcome. Notably, none of the primary or secondary BAs 
alone were associated with reduced survival, suggesting that the metabolism of BAs, rather 
than BAs per se may play a role in chronic HF. The levels of circulating BAs, however, are 
low and subject to large inter-individual variation 21, and given the moderate sample size of 
our study, the low number of clinical events and the single time-point blood draw, there is 
therefore a risk of underestimating the potential effect of individual BAs. In particular, the 
potent effect of the secondary bile acid LC (elevated in HF) on the bile acid receptor TGR5, 
expressed in the heart, could have physiological consequences not detected in the present 
study 22
. On the other hand, it was recently reported from a mouse model that an elevated 
level of total serum BA could contribute to liver-associated cardiac dysfunction, possibly due 
to impaired cardiac fatty acid oxidation, suggesting the involvement of the total BA pool, 
rather than individual BAs in HF23
. 
Page 14 of 25

15
In addition to gut microbiota dependent conversion from primary to secondary BAs, other 
factors influencing the production, metabolism and clearance of individual BAs could have 
affected the secondary/primary BA ratio. First, it should be noted that this ratio was driven by 
higher levels of some secondary BAs, and lower levels of some primary BAs, and does not 
necessarily reflect an increased global transformation from primary to secondary BAs in HF. 
Although dietary habits of the study population were not controlled for, we observed that the 
taurin conjugated primary BAs TCDC and TCA were negatively correlated with albumin. 
Furthermore, the primary BAs GCA and TCA, as well as total primary BAs were correlated 
with ALT. Hence, protein malnutrition and liver congestion could both could be associated 
with higher levels of primary BAs in some patients, which could have reduced rather than 
amplified the secondary/primary BA ratio in HF patients. Furthermore, although BAs may 
interact with glucose metabolism and energy homeostasis 4,5
, none of the individual BAs 
were associated with glycemic control as measured by HbA1c. Finally, with the exception of 
a negative correlation between the secondary BA LC and eGFR, levels of BAs did not seem 
to be influenced by renal clearance, and the difference in BA ratio between HF patients and 
controls remained significant after adjustment for eGFR and current smoking.
Factors influencing the gut microbiota could also have affected our results. Although none of 
the patients used antibiotics at the time of blood collection, we do not have data on the use of 
antibiotics in the period before hospitalization, and these medications can perturb the gut 
microbiota, resulting in failure of the BA dehydroxylation necessary for the formation of 
secondary BAs. Another limitation is lack of BMIs in half of the control subjects, although 
the BA ratio was not associated with BMI in the HF patients. Moreover, relatively few 
patients were included and the number of fatal events during follow-up was also low. Finally, 
Page 15 of 25

16
this is a purely descriptive study and at present no conclusion can be drawn on causes and 
consequences of the disturbed BA metabolism in HF. 
In conclusion, levels of primary BAs were reduced and specific secondary BAs increased in 
patients with chronic HF. Although this pattern was associated with reduced overall survival 
in univariate analysis, this association was lost in multivariate analyses. Future studies should 
thoroughly assess the potential role of the BA composition in patients with HF, and 
investigate whether manipulation of factors influencing BA metabolism, including the 
intestinal microbial community, could alter clinical outcome.
