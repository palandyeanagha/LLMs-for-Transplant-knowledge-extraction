Abstract
Background: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in humans is caused by an unchecked proinflammatory
response that results in diffuse and severe lung injury, and it is associated with a mortality rate of 35 to 45%.
Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs; ‘adult stem cells’) could represent a promising new therapy for this syndrome,
since preclinical evidence suggests that MSCs may ameliorate lung injury. Prior to a human clinical trial, our aim is
to conduct a systematic review to compare the efficacy and safety of MSC therapy versus controls in preclinical
models of acute lung injury that mimic some aspects of the human ARDS.
Methods/Design: We will include comparative preclinical studies (randomized and non-randomized) of acute lung
injury in which MSCs were administered and outcomes compared to animals given a vehicle control. The primary
outcome will be death. Secondary outcomes will include the four key features of preclinical acute lung injury as
defined by the American Thoracic Society consensus conference (histologic evidence of lung injury, altered alveolar
capillary barrier, lung inflammatory response, and physiological dysfunction) and pathogen clearance for acute lung
injury models that are caused by infection. Electronic searches of MEDLINE, Embase, BIOSIS Previews, and Web of
Science will be constructed and reviewed by the Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS) process. Search
results will be screened independently and in duplicate. Data from eligible studies will be extracted, pooled, and
analyzed using random effects models. Risk of bias will be assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, and
individual study reporting will be assessed according to the Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments
(ARRIVE) guidelines.
Discussion: The results of this systematic review will comprehensively summarize the safety and efficacy of MSC
therapy in preclinical models of acute lung injury. Our results will help translational scientists and clinical trialists to
determine whether sufficient evidence exists to perform a human clinical trial. These results may also guide future
acute lung injury preclinical and clinical research.

Background
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a devas￾tating clinical condition caused by an acute, diffuse, and
severe lung injury that requires management in the in￾tensive care unit. It is characterized by unchecked in￾flammation that leads to severe hypoxemia, pulmonary
alveolar and capillary membrane leakage, and progres￾sive respiratory failure [1,2]. Approximately 200,000 new
cases are identified in the United States each year [3]
and it is a leading cause of death with mortality rates of
approximately 35 to 45% [4].Significant long-term seque￾lae for survivors include physical, psychological, and
emotional dysfunction that results in only half of previ￾ously healthy individuals returning to employment at
one year after their illness [3,5,6]. The ARDS also carries
a significant economic burden, as it has the highest cost
per case of any acute care condition currently treated
[7].
There are over 50 different causes of ARDS (see
Table 1), with sepsis and pulmonary aspiration being the
most common [8,9]. The pathophysiology of ARDS is
complex, but its hallmarks include lung endothelial and
alveolar epithelial injury with a consequent increase in
membrane permeability and the accumulation of
protein-rich debris in the alveolar air space [10]. Injury
to the epithelium and endothelium is largely caused by a
complex and exaggerated production of many inflamma￾tory mediators (for exampleTNF-α, IL-6) [8,11,12].
These host processes are likely responsible for the high
rates of morbidity and mortality of this illness.
Supportive care strategies are the mainstay of therapy
for ARDS. These include low tidal volume mechanical
ventilation, restrictive fluid restriction strategies, and
more recently prone positioning and paralysis [13-16].
Despite these interventions, the mortality for ARDS re￾mains considerably high. Thus, the evaluation of novel
therapeutics is required to reduce morbidity and death
associated with this devastating syndrome [10]. Mesen￾chymal stromal cells (MSCs) may represent one novel
therapy for this inflammatory condition.
MSCs (also known as ‘adult stem cells’, marrow stro￾mal cells, or mesenchymal stem cells) have been well
characterized and may be isolated from virtually every
tissue type, including bone marrow, adipose tissue, and
the umbilical cord [17]. In vivo,endogenous MSCs con￾tribute to vascular homeostasis and respond to inflam￾mation [18]. When cultured ex vivo and administered in
larger numbers, MSCs are highly immunomodulatory
[19]. In preclinical research, models described as ‘acute
lung injury’ are used to study the clinical entity of ARDS.
In these preclinical acute lung injury models, MSCs
modulate the inflammatory response, augment tissue re￾pair, enhance pathogen clearance, and reduce severity of
injury, pulmonary dysfunction, and death [20-29].
As a prelude to a human clinical trial we will conduct
a systematic synthesis of MSC therapy for preclinical
acute lung injury. These data will help to determine
whether there is a sufficient range of methodologically
rigorous evidence to support a clinical trial administer￾ing MSCs in humans with ARDS. These data may also
help to guide the objectives and designs of future pre￾clinical and clinical research.
Study question
In controlled preclinical studies of acute lung injury, do
MSCs reduce death and the severity of acute lung injury
as described by the American Thoracic Society preclin￾ical acute lung injury consensus conference [30], and do
they enhance pathogen clearance in infectious acute
lung injury models?
Methods and design
Protocol and registration
The systematic review and meta-analysis protocol was de￾veloped through discussions with our scientific research
team of clinical (LM, DF) and preclinical research scientists
(ML,SM, DS), an information specialist (BS), experts in
knowledge synthesis and translation (DM, JG, MM, KS,
MA), knowledge users from the Canadian Critical Care Tri￾als Group (CCCTG; JM), the Canadian Stem Cell Network
(MR), and the Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC;
GG), and the Canadian Critical Care Translational Biology
Group(CCCTBG; http://www.ccctbg.ca). It is listed on the
Collaborative Approach to MetaAnalysis and Review of
Animal Data from Experimental Studies (CAMARADES)

Study eligibility criteria
We will include controlled comparative studies (ran￾domized, quasi-randomized, and non-randomized) of
preclinical acute lung injury that evaluate the efficacy
and safety outcomes of MSC treatment.
Preclinical model eligibility criteria
We will include all preclinical in vivo animal models of
experimentally induced acute lung injury that mimic at
least some aspects of the pathophysiology of humans
with ARDS according to the American Thoracic Society
consensus criteria [30]. The inclusion of a wide range of
acute lung injury animal models should enhance the
generalizability of our study findings. Acute lung injury
in animal models may be induced by several experimen￾tal methods (Table 2). These include direct(for example
intratracheal bacteria or endotoxin), or indirect (for ex￾ample intravenous or intraperitoneal bacteria or endo￾toxin) induction of infectious acute lung injury, and
induction of injury by the ventilator (ventilator-induced
lung injury), chemicals, or chemotherapeutic agents(for
example bleomycin, oleic acid, hydrochloric acid),
trauma, shock (for example hemorrhagic), or remote
organ injury (for example pancreatitis, ischemia reperfu￾sion). We will exclude neonatal animal models of acute
lung injury since our proposed future clinical trial will
focus on adults with ARDS and because the mechanisms
of disease, and efficacy of treatments, are likely to be dif￾ferent in this group.
Intervention
The preclinical intervention group will include animals
from studies that examine MSC celltypes (xenogeneic,
syngeneic, or allogeneic cells from any tissue source).
MSCs will be defined using minimal criteria set out in
the International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT)
consensus statement [31]. MSCs must be administered
during or following the induction of experimental acute
lung injury. Experiments using pretreatment of MSCs
will be excluded since they are clinically relevant for the
prevention, but not the treatment, of human ARDS. In
order to focus on non-manipulated MSCs, studies using
either differentiated MSCs (for example MSCs that have
been differentiated to an endothelial cell) or MSCs engi￾neered to over- or under-express particular genes, or
studies using a co-treatment with another therapy or cell
type will be excluded.
Comparison
The preclinical comparison group will include animals
from studies that have had experimental acute lung in￾jury induced but have not been administered MSCs.
This will allow us to perform effect size calculations in
our meta-analysis to examine how efficacious and safe
these cells are in the acute lung injury. We will use other
control groups, such as healthy animals or sham-injured
controls, to examine the severity of preclinical acute
lung injury.
Preclinical primary endpoint: death
The primary endpoint is death, measured at specific
time points after administration of the MSCs or control
intervention. Time of death will be categorized as less
than 2 days, between 2 to 4 days, and greater than 4 days.
We will also measure all deaths that occur by the end of
the follow-up period to give a measure of overall mortal￾ity. Death is a clinically meaningful endpoint given the
high mortality rate of clinical ARDS [3]. The timing of
our mortality assessments is intended to capture the
burden of both early and late deaths as is typically seen
in clinical trials of humans with acute lung injury (for
example intensive care unit mortality, 28-day mortality,
and 90-day mortality). The timing for these death assess￾ments also reflects when the majority of deaths occur in
the acute lung injury experimental animal setting. For
example, one preclinical study demonstrated that mor￾tality at 48 hours was 60%, and the majority of deaths
occurred between 30 to 40 hours post-experimental in￾duction of acute lung injury [29].
Preclinical secondary endpoints
A consensus statement by the American Thoracic Society
describes four key features that define acute lung injury in
the animal model along with specific measurements to as￾sess for the presence of each feature [30]. These are sum￾marized in Table 3. Our secondary endpoints will include
the four main features and focus on the ‘very relevant’ mea￾surements defined by the consensus criteria [30]. These in￾clude histologic evidence of lung injury (for example lung
injury score), alteration of the alveolar capillary barrier (for
example increased concentration of high molecular weight

proteins in bronchoalveolar fluid),measures of the inflam￾matory response in the lung (for example pulmonary
neutrophils, cytokines), and measures of physiological dys￾function (for example alveolar-arterial gradient of oxygen
concentration). The American Thoracic Society consensus
statement does not specify which lung inflammatory cyto￾kines to measure. Hence, our team of translational cell and
acute lung injury scientists (JM, SM, DS,ML) established
consensus on what cytokines would be considered ‘most
relevant’ for analysis in our systematic review (see Table 3).
Modified from the American Thoracic Society consen￾sus statement [30]. This workshop was held with transla￾tional investigators to identify the defining features and
measurements for acute lung injury animal models to
simulate the pathophysiology of human ARDS. ARDS,
acute respiratory distress syndrome; BAL, bronchoalveo￾lar lavage; IFN, interferon; IgM, immunoglobulin M; IL,
interleukin; MPO, myeloperoxidase; TNF, tumor necro￾sis factor.
For animal models that use infectious induction of
acute lung injury, we will describe pathogen clearance
(for example number of bacterial colony forming units)
in different tissue beds, since animal sepsis models sug￾gest that this is increased by MSCs [32-34].
All secondary endpoints will be analyzed in categories of
time from the induction of acute lung injury of less than
6 hours, between 6 and 24 hours, between greater than 24
and 72 hours, and day 7 after the administration of MSCs
versus controls. These time points for measurement were
selected since the development of inflammation and acute
lung injury occurs over time and contributes to death and
morbidity in this population [2]. Where reported, the oc￾currence of adverse events will also be documented for
each included study.
Information sources
Search strategies will be developed and tested through an
iterative process by an experienced medical information
specialist in consultation with the review team. Using the
Ovid platform, we will search Ovid MEDLINE®, Ovid
MEDLINE® In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations,
and Embase Classic plus Embase. We will also search BIO￾SIS and Web of Science using Web of Knowledge. The
strategy will be reviewed by another senior information spe￾cialist using the Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies
(PRESS) template [35].
Search strategies will use a combination of controlled
vocabulary (for examplemesenchymal stem cells, acute lung
injury, respiratory distress syndrome) and keywords (for
example MSCs, ALI, acute/adult respiratory distress
syndrome). Vocabulary and syntax will be adjusted across
the databases. Two recently published animal filters [36,37],
validated for PubMed/MEDLINE and Embase and
amended slightly, will be used to increase relevancy. These
filters will be adjusted for use in the other databases where
a validated filter is unavailable. There will be no language
or date restrictions on any of the searches. We will perform
a grey literature search of selected conference websites not
covered in the aforementioned databases, and will search
the websites of animal research organizations. We will also
search Mendeley and Google Scholar. The proposed Ovid
search appears in Additional file 1.
The research team will contact authors of included stud￾ies to invite the further contribution of any unpublished
data relevant to this review. The bibliographies of included
studies and pertinent reviews will also be hand searched for
further preclinical studies. Unpublished studies will be de￾scribed in the results section but data from these studies
will be included in any quantitative analyses. The research
team will also contact biotechnology companies (for ex￾ample Osiris Therapeutics, Columbia, MD, USA) that pro￾duce MSCs to identify further unpublished studies or
studies that are currently ongoing.

Study selection
The titles and abstracts of search results will be screened
independently by two investigators. The fulltext of all
potentially eligible studies will be retrieved and reviewed
for eligibility, independently, by two members of the
team using the a priori inclusion criteria described
above. Disagreements between reviewers will be resolved
by consensus or by a third member of the systematic re￾view team (LM or ML). Reasons for exclusion of poten￾tially eligible studies will be recorded to enable a
transparent selection process and to be in accordance
with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Re￾views and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines devel￾oped for proper reporting of clinical systematic reviews
[38].
Data collection and process and data items
Data will be extracted independently by two members of
the research team into standardized, pilot-tested forms.
Specific data elements are listed in Table 4.
Assessment of risk of bias
Risk of bias will be evaluated independently by two re￾viewers for each included preclinical study. Since no val￾idated and standardized risk of bias checklist exists for
preclinical studies, we will describe the biases of the in￾cluded studies using the Cochrane risk of bias assess￾ment tool [39]. Items in this tool include assessments
for concealment of allocation, random sequence gener￾ation, blinding of personnel and the endpoint measure￾ments, and completeness of endpoint reporting. Each
bias criterion will be assigned a value of low, high, or un￾clear risk of bias for each included study [39].
Assessment of construct validity and external validity
We will also record features that will facilitate judge￾ments of construct validity and external validity [40].
Construct validity in preclinical research concerns the
extent to which an experimental system accurately
models a clinical entity. These will include: type, age,
gender, and strain of animal; presence of co-morbidities;
type of acute lung injury model; timing, dose and mode
of MSC administration; and use of co-interventions (for
example fluid resuscitation, use of antibiotics for infec￾tious acute lung injury models) (Table 5). External valid￾ity in preclinical research concerns the extent to which
cause and effect relationships holdup under varied con￾ditions [41]. In our study this will include the use of a
multi-centre preclinical study (Table 5).
Description of reporting
We will describe the quality of reporting of the included
preclinical studies using the elements of the Animal Re￾search: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE)
guidelines. The ARRIVE guidelines were developed to
enhance the transparent and comprehensive reporting of
research methods and results for in vivo animal experi￾ments [42].
Data analysis
Where appropriate, dichotomous endpoints (for example
death) from each included study will be pooled and de￾scribed as odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals in￾corporating a random effects modeling approach with
the use of forest plots for presentation of the data [43].
Continuous endpoints will be pooled using the ratio of
weighted means method with inverse variance random
effects modeling [44]. Statistical heterogeneity of in￾cluded preclinical studies will be measured using the I2
test with 95% uncertainty intervals [45]. If there are suf￾ficient number of studies (≥10), an evaluation for the

presence of publication bias will be conducted with fun￾nel plot techniques, and Egger’s regression test [46].
Sensitivity analyses to examine heterogeneity on the pri￾mary endpoint death will be carried out according to risk
of bias assessments. Several subgroup analyses to examine
preclinical heterogeneity will be conducted on the primary
endpoint death (see Table 5). Where appropriate, analyses
will include: definition of death; the type of animal model;
animal age [47], gender, and strain; presence of co morbid￾ities; type of experimental induction of acute lung injury
(Table 2); severity of the acute lung injury model [30]; MSC
preparation; timing of administration of MSCs from induc￾tion of acute lung injury; route of MSC administration; type
of controls; use of co-interventions, antibiotics, and mech￾anical ventilation; single versus multi-centre study; and
presence of an a priori sample size calculation. These sub￾group analyses are exploratory and the results will be inter￾preted with caution.
Knowledge translation
The results of this systematic review will be of interest to a
broad audience, and we have identified several knowledge
users. We have planned an end of study knowledge transla￾tion workshop where our key findings will be disseminated
to the group members and key stakeholders. In addition,
this workshop will identify further avenues of dissemination
and determine future research directions.
Our Principal Knowledge user (JM) will help facilitate
presentation of study results at national and international
critical care meetings. Two other knowledge users will aid
the international dissemination of results through the
Canadian Stem Cell Network, internationally through Cell￾CAN (MR), and through the International Council for La￾boratory Animal Science (ICLAS; GG) which encourages
better reporting and translation of animal science.
Discussion
The results of this systematic review will inform transla￾tional and clinical scientists, clinicians, and health regula￾tors internationally regarding the existing preclinical
evidence for MSC therapy in acute lung injury. Our review
is timely since there is an increasing amount of research
dedicated to the evaluation or MSCs in many clinical do￾mains [48]. Many therapeutics that appear promising in
preclinical studies fail to translate into successful therapies.
In a systematic review of highly cited animal studies, only
one-third of studies translated to human randomized con￾trolled trials (RCTs) [49]. This lack of translation may, in
part, be related to failure to acknowledge the limitations of
preclinical studies [50], as well as methodological flaws that
bias the treatment effect in clinical trials that may also
apply to preclinical studies. For example, preclinical
interventional research in stroke and emergency medi￾cine suggeststhat these weaknesses are associated with
overestimates of the effect size for different treatments
and publication bias [50,51]. Hence, our review is crit￾ical before spending the substantial energy and funding
that is required to conduct a clinical trial. In a broader
perspective, we also hope this review will identify chal￾lenges and barriers related to the conduct of these pre￾clinical studies. Ultimately, our team will inform and
enrich future preclinical and clinical MSC research that
should aid the translation of this novel therapeutic in
clinical trials.
