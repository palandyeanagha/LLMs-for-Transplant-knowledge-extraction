Introduction
Lung transplantation is a therapeutic option for end-stage
pulmonary disorders. Unfortunately, lung rejection is a
common complication with an incidence and severity that
exceed those of all other solid organ transplantations (1,
2). Chronic lung allograft rejection, known as bronchioli￾tis obliterans syndrome (BOS), is the leading cause of mor￾tality after lung transplantation and is the reason the 7-
year survival after lung transplantation is only 31% (1, 2).
BOS is a chronic inflammatory process, demonstrat￾ing features of dysregulated repair. It is characterized
by persistent peribronchiolar leukocyte infiltration
that eventually disrupts the basement membrane, sub￾mucosa, and airway epithelium (1, 2). Fibroprolifera￾tion follows with increased numbers of mesenchymal
cells, submucosal matrix deposition, and granulation
tissue formation, ultimately leading to fibro-oblitera￾tion of airways (1, 2). Importantly, acute lung allograft
rejection is the major risk factor for the development of
BOS and is characterized by a perivascular/bronchiolar
recruitment of mononuclear cells that ultimately leads
to architectural destruction (1, 2).
BOS is classically described as an ongoing immuno￾logical event; however, aggressive immunosuppressive
therapy does not affect the naturally occuring develop￾ment of this disorder (1, 2). Moreover, the specific medi￾ators that orchestrate the persistent recruitment of
leukocytes leading to fibro-obliteration have not been
fully elucidated. MCP-1 is a CC chemokine, and it is a
potent chemoattractant for mononuclear cells, specifi￾cally mononuclear phagocytes, CD45RO+ T lympho￾cytes, B cells, and NK cells (3, 4). MCP-1 is involved in
chronic inflammatory/fibroproliferative diseases such
as rheumatoid arthritis (5). MCP-1 binds and signals
through a seven-transmembrane-spanning G pro￾tein–coupled receptor, CCR2 (6).
We hypothesize that the continuum of lung allograft
rejection from acute to chronic rejection results from a
persistent immunological/inflammatory insult to the
allograft airways. This persistent insult is due, in part,
to the expression of MCP-1 and its interaction with its
major mononuclear cell receptor, CCR2, which leads to
chronic peribronchiolar leukocyte infiltration and
eventual obliteration of the airways. Our studies

Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is the major limitation to survival after lung transplanta￾tion. Acute rejection, its main risk factor, is characterized by perivascular/bronchiolar leukocyte infil￾tration. BOS is characterized by persistent peribronchiolar leukocyte recruitment leading to airway
fibrosis and obliteration. The specific mechanism(s) by which these leukocytes are recruited are
unknown. Because MCP-1, acting through its receptor CCR2, is a potent mononuclear cell chemoat￾tractant, we hypothesized that expression of this chemokine during an allogeneic-response promotes
persistent recruitment of leukocytes and, ultimately, rejection. We found that elevated levels of bio￾logically active MCP-1 in human bronchial lavage fluid (BALF) were associated with the continuum
from acute to chronic allograft rejection. Translational studies in a murine model of BOS demon￾strated increased MCP-1 expression paralleling mononuclear cell recruitment and CCR2 expression.
Loss of MCP-1/CCR2 signaling, as seen in CCR2–/– mice or in WT mice treated with neutralizing anti￾bodies to MCP-1, significantly reduced recruitment of mononuclear phagocytes following tracheal
transplantation and led to attenuation of BOS. Lymphocyte infiltration was not reduced under these
conditions. We suggest that MCP-1/CCR2 signaling plays an important role in recruitment of
mononuclear phagocytes, a pivotal event in the pathogenesis of BOS.

demonstrate that biologically active human MCP-1 in
bronchial lavage fluid (BALF) is associated with both
acute rejection and BOS. Translational studies in a
murine model of BOS using CCR2–/– compared with
CCR2+/+ mice significantly attenuated the pathogene￾sis of BOS. In addition, neutralizing antibodies to
MCP-1 demonstrated a significant reduction in fibro￾obliteration. These findings may ultimately result in
novel therapies designed to modulate MCP-1/CCR2
signaling and retard the development of BOS.
Methods
Patient population. With Institutional Review Board
approval and informed written consent, we prospec￾tively enrolled all patients undergoing both lung and
heart-lung transplantation at the University of Michi￾gan Hospital during 1992–1997. Patients were eligible
for this study if they survived at least 6 months after
transplantation. Of 92 patients who were evaluated, 77
were included in the study (41 female and 36 male;
mean age of 51.4 ± 1.4 years). Fifteen patients were
excluded from the study owing to technical problems
in coordinating the collection of the sample.
The transplant recipients were divided into three
groups. The first group comprised healthy lung trans￾plant recipients without infection or rejection 
(n = 30), who were undergoing surveillance bron￾choscopy. We used their last available BALF in time.
The second group comprised lung transplant recipi￾ents who developed acute lung allograft rejection 
(n = 27), without concomitant infection as diagnosed
by pathological findings on transbronchial biopsy (7).
The third group was composed of lung transplant
recipients who developed stage II or greater BOS with￾out concomitant infection or acute rejection (n = 20).
BALFs from patients with infection were excluded as
determined by positive microbiology and/or cytology
results as described previously (8). The exclusion of
any BALF as well as the assignment to the proper
group was done prospectively without knowledge of
the BALF chemokine levels. All patients were placed
on a standard pre- and posttransplantation immuno￾suppression, bacterial, and viral prophylaxis as
described previously (8).
BALF. BALF was obtained from our three groups of lung
transplant recipients and processed by methods described
previously (8). Cell-free BALF was aliquoted and frozen
immediately until thawed for MCP-1 ELISA (8).
Reagents. Polyclonal rabbit anti-human MCP-1, anti￾murine MCP-1, and goat anti-murine MIP-2–specific
anti-serum was produced by the immunization of rab￾bits or goats with the appropriate recombinant human
and murine chemokines (MCP-1 or MIP-2) (R&D Sys￾tems Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA) in multiple
intradermal sites with complete Freund’s adjuvant
(9–12). The specificity of these antibodies was assessed
by Western blot analysis against a panel of other
human and murine recombinant cytokines. Antibod￾ies were specific in our sandwich ELISA without cross￾reactivity to a panel of cytokines including human and
murine IL-1Ra, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-4, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and
members of the CXC and CC chemokine families.
Monocyte chemotaxis. Monocyte chemotaxis was pre￾formed as described previously (8). Briefly, monocytes
were prepared from human peripheral blood by Ficoll￾Hypaque density gradient centrifugation. Five ran￾domly selected patient BALFs from each group were
pooled. The samples from each group, 10 ng/ml of
MCP-1, or HBSS was preincubated with either preim￾mune serum (NRS) or neutralizing rabbit antihuman
MCP-1 antiserum for 30 minutes at 37°C. Chemotaxis
was performed as described previously (8).
Immunohistochemical localization of antigenic human and
murine MCP-1. Paraffin-embedded tissue from open
lung biopsies from five patients with BOS and five day
7 tracheal allografts and syngeneic controls were
processed for immunohistochemical localization of
MCP-1, using NRS or polyclonal rabbit anti-human or
murine MCP-1 antibodies as described previously (11).
Murine BOS model. We used a well-established and
reproducible murine model of BOS involving heterotopic
subcutaneous trachea transplantation studies (13–15).
The MHC class I–and class II–disparate combination was
BALB/c (H-2d) to C57BL/6 (H-2b) (allografts), and
C57BL/6 (H-2b) to C57BL/6 (H-2b) (syngeneic control).
To assess the inhibition of MCP-1/CCR2 signaling on
leukocyte infiltration and fibro-obliteration we per￾formed tracheal allograft experiments with CCR2–/–
(knockout mice) versus CCR2+/+ (wild-type) recipient
mice. A breeding colony containing both murine geno￾types were maintained under specific pathogen-free
conditions asdescribed previously (16, 17). CCR2+/+ and
CCR2–/– mice were generated from mating homozygous
mice of the same genetic background (C57BL/6 ×
129Sv) and were intercrossed for five to seven genera￾tions to establish the C57BL/6 strain (16, 17).
We evaluated differences in the immune response from
CCR2–/– versus CCR2+/+ mice by performing transplants
with CCR2–/– versus CCR2+/+ tracheas into BALB/c. In
addition, allografts (BALB/c trachea to C57BL/6) were
passively immunized with intraperitoneal injections of
0.5 ml of anti-murine MCP-1 serum or NRS on days 1,
3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13 after transplantation to further eval￾uate the role of MCP-1/CCR2 signaling during BOS.
Histopathological grading of BOS. Six random paraffin￾embedded tissue sections for six different trachea allo￾grafts were stained with Masson’s trichrome and hema￾toxylin and eosin (H&E) at days 3, 7, 14, and 21. The
histopathology was blindly reviewed with a modified
histological scoring system as described previously (13,
18). All qualitative histological changes were noted, and
four easily identifiable pathological processes were
scored on a scale of 0–4 (0 = normal, 1 = mild, 2 = mod￾erate, 3 = severe, and 4 = very severe damage) as
described previously (13, 18): (a) airway lining epithe￾lial loss, (b) deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM),
(c) leukocyte infiltration, and (d) luminal obliteration
due to granulation tissue formation and/or fibrosis.

MCP-1 and MIP-2 protein ELISA. MCP-1 and MIP-2
protein was quantitated using a modification of a dou￾ble-ligand method as described previously (11, 12).
FACS analysis of infiltrating leukocyte populations. Tracheal
single-cell suspension preparations were made from
harvested tracheas using a method described previous￾ly (12). Single-cell suspensions (5 × 106 cells/ml) were
stained with Tricolor conjugated anti-murine CD45
(Caltag Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, Califor￾nia, USA) followed by PE-conjugated mouse anti￾murine CD3e, CD4, CD8a, FITC anti-murine Ly-6G
(PharMingen, San Diego, California, USA), FITC-con￾jugated anti-murine MOMA-2 (Seratec Inc., Raleigh,
North Carolina, USA), or isotype controls. The cell sus￾pensions were analyzed as described previously (11, 12).
Total RNA isolation and RT-PCR amplification. Total cel￾lular RNA from tracheal tissue was isolated as described
previously (9–12). Total RNA was determined, and 1 µg
of total RNA was reversed transcribed into cDNA and
amplified using Access RT-PCR kit (Promega Corp.,
Madison, Wisconsin, USA) and specific primers for
murine MCP-1, CCR2, procollagen type I and III, and
our housekeeping gene, β-actin. The primers used were
as follows: 5′-TTG-TAA-CCA-ACT-GGG-ACG-ATA-TGG-3′
(sense) and 5′-GAT-CTT-GAT-CTT-CAT-GGT-GCT-AGG-3′
(anti-sense) for β actin (764 bp); 5′-AAG-CGT-GAC-AGA￾GAC-CTG-CAT-AGT-GGT-GG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCA-CCA￾CTA-TGC-AGG-TCT-CTG-TCA-CGC-TT-3′ (anti-sense) for
murine MCP-1 (320 bp); 5′-CAC-GAA-GTA-TCC-AAG-AGC￾TT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAT-GCT-CTT-CAG-CTT-TTT-AC-3′
(anti-sense) for murine CCR-2; 5′-TGG-TGC-CAA-GGG￾TCT-CAC-TGG-C-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGA-CCT-TGT-ACA￾CCA-CGT-TCA-CC-3′ (anti-sense) for procollagen type I
(352 bp); and 5′-GCA-GTC-CAA-CGT-AGA-TGA-ATT-GG-3′
(sense) and 5′-GAA-GGC-CTG-GTG-GAC-CAG-CTG-G-3′
(anti-sense) for procollagen type III (251 bp). After
amplification, the sample was separated on an agarose
gel containing ethidium bromide and bands visualized
and photographed using an ultraviolet transilluminator
(19). The image densities were measured with NIH
The Journal of Clinical Investigation | August 2001 | Volume 108 | Number 4 549

Image software, version 1.62 (NIH, Bethesda, Maryland,
USA), and semiquantitative results were expressed as a
ratio of each RT-PCR product to β-actin density.
Hydroxyproline assay. Total tracheal collagen was
determined by analysis of hydroxyproline as described
previously (11).
Statistical analysis. Data were analyzed on a Dell PC (Dell
Computer Corp., Austin, Texas, USA) using the Statview
4.5 statistical package (Abacus Concepts Inc., Berkeley,
California, USA). Comparisons were evaluated by the
unpaired t test. Nonparametric data were evaluated by
Mann-Whitney analyses for statistical significance and
displayed using a box plot summary. The plot’s hori￾zontal line represents the median; the box encompasses
the 25th to 75th percentiles; and the error bars encom￾pass the 10th to 90th percentiles. Continuous data were
expressed as mean ± SEM. Data were considered statis￾tically significant if P values were 0.05 or less.
Results
Elevated levels of biologically active MCP-1 are associated with
both human acute lung allograft rejection and human BOS. We
first determined whether MCP-1 was present in the
lungs from patients undergoing BOS. MCP-1 levels in
BALF were significantly elevated in patients with BOS,
compared with the healthy recipients (210 ± 36 vs. 72 ±
13, respectively) (P < 0.0001) (Figure 1a). There were no
significant differences in duration after transplantation
between these groups (28.2 ± 4.8 vs. 24.8 ± 3.2 months,
respectively) (P > 0.05), although there were differences
between the acute rejection and healthy groups as
expected (6.2 ± 1.8 vs. 24.8 ± 3.2 months, respectively) 
(P < 0.001) (Figure 1b). Given that acute rejection is the
greatest risk factor for the development of BOS, we eval￾uated the role of MCP-1 in the continuum of lung allo￾graft rejection from acute to chronic rejection and
determined MCP-1 levels in BALF from patients with
acute rejection. Similar to the findings in the BOS
group, we found elevated levels of MCP-1 in the acute
rejection group compared with the healthy group (118
± 16 vs. 72 ± 13; respectively) (P = 0.01) (Figure 1a).
The elevated levels of MCP-1 in the BALF from both
the acute rejection and BOS groups were biologically
active as assessed by mononuclear cell chemotaxis (Fig￾ure 1c). Neutralizing antibodies to MCP-1 significant￾ly attenuated the chemoattractant activity in both the
acute rejection and BOS groups compared with NRS
(Figure 1c). There was no significant effect found with
the neutralizing antibodies to MCP-1 or NRS in the
healthy group (Figure 1c). Immunohistochemical
staining was used to localize antigenic MCP-1 in lung
biopsies from patients with BOS. Predominant cellular
sources of MCP-1 were columnar epithelial cells and
the mononuclear cells (Figure 1, d–g).
Murine BOS involves increased expression of procollagen type
I and III, deposition of ECM, airway obliteration, and epithelial
injury. To determine MCP-1’s contribution to the patho￾genesis of BOS, we used a murine model system of BOS

(13–15, 18). Because BOS is a fibroproliferative disease,
we determined whether there was expression of procolla￾gen types (I and III) in murine allografts at day 21, a time
point of maximal fibro-obliteration. Procollagens types
(I and III) mRNA expression was markedly upregulated
in the allografts compared with syngeneic controls (Fig￾ure 2, a–c). We confirmed these findings, demonstrating
a temporal increase in total collagen (hydroxyproline) lev￾els in the allografts compared with syngeneic controls
(Figure 2d). In addition, morphometric analysis of H&E
and Masson’s Trichrome staining of histopathological
sections of allografts demonstrated significant increases
in ECM deposition, airway obliteration, and loss of
epithelial integrity compared with those found in syn￾geneic controls on days 7–21 (data not shown).
There is increased leukocyte infiltration during murine BOS.
Our human data suggest that MCP-1 expression is a piv￾otal event in the continuum from acute to chronic of
lung allograft rejection, through the persistent recruit￾ment of peribronchial mononuclear cells. The magni￾tude and characteristics of leukocyte infiltration into
allografts during murine BOS were quantitated by FACS
(Becton Dickinson and Co., Franklin Lakes, New Jersey,
USA) analysis. The most striking finding was the exten￾sive number of mononuclear phagocytes infiltrating the
allograft that was persistent during days 7–21, compared
with that of syngeneic controls (Figure 3, top left). The
numbers of infiltrating mononuclear phagocytes were
markedly greater than the numbers of lymphocytes
(CD3, CD4, and CD8) and neutrophils throughout the
21-day time course (Figure 3). This was confirmed by
morphometric analysis of allograft histopathological
sections demonstrating an aggressive transmural leuko￾cyte infiltration peaking at day 7, persisting at day 14,
and giving way to chronic inflammatory/fibroprolifera￾tive changes at day 21 (data not shown). In contrast, syn￾geneic controls demonstrated minimal peritracheal infil￾tration of leukocytes (data not shown).
MCP-1 mRNA and protein are elevated during murine
BOS. Demonstrating a mononuclear phagocyte domi￾nant leukocyte infiltration into the allograft with sub￾sequent development of fibro-obliteration lead us to
determine the full kinetics of MCP-1 during the patho￾genesis of BOS. MCP-1 mRNA from allografts peaked
at day 7 and remained significantly elevated through￾out the 21-day time course, compared with that of syn￾geneic controls (Figure 4a). A similar pattern was seen
with MCP-1 protein (Figure 4b).
Immunohistochemical staining was used to localize
antigenic MCP-1 in allografts at day 7. We found 
MCP-1 staining localized predominantly to airway colum￾nar epithelium and mononuclear cells (Figure 4, d and e).
In contrast there was virtually undetectable localization
of MCP-1 in syngeneic controls at day 7 (data not shown).

CCR2 expression parallels both MCP-1 expression and
recruitment of mononuclear cells during murine BOS. CCR2
is the major mononuclear cell receptor for the ligand,
MCP-1. CCR2 mRNA from allografts was upregulated
at day 3, peaked at day 7, and remained significantly
elevated through day 21, compared with that of syn￾geneic controls (Figure 5a). CCR2 expression paralleled
both MCP-1 expression and mononuclear cell recruit￾ment (Figure 3 and Figure 4, a and b).
CCR2–/– mice display defective recruitment of mononu￾clear phagocytes during murine BOS. With MCP-1 corre￾lating with the recruitment of mononuclear cells and
expression of CCR2, we determined whether inhibit￾ing MCP-1/CCR2 signaling could attenuate leuko￾cyte recruitment. We used a genetic strategy using
CCR2–/– versus CCR2+/+ mice as the recipients of
BALB/c tracheal allografts. We found reductions in
infiltrating mononuclear phagocytes from the
CCR2–/– mice through day 21 by FACS analysis (Fig￾ure 6a). Importantly, this occurred without signifi￾cant reductions in lymphocytes (CD3, CD4, and
CD8) (Figure 6, b–d). Furthermore, neutrophils were
reduced in the CCR2–/– recipients at day 7 (Figure 6e).
These results were further confirmed by semiquanti￾tative analysis of histopathological sections demon￾strating significant reductions in infiltrating leuko￾cytes from CCR2–/– recipients (Figure 7).
The increased production of potent leukocyte
chemoattractants, such as MCP-1 and MIP-2, are char￾acteristic of allograft rejection (20). We found no sig￾nificant difference between MCP-1 protein levels in
allografts from CCR2–/– versus CCR2+/+ mice through￾out the 21-day time course (Figure 6f). However, 
MIP-2 levels were reduced at day 7 in allografts from
CCR2–/– mice, which correlated with the reduction of
neutrophils in the CCR2–/– mice at day 7 (Figure 6g).
CCR2–/– mice demonstrated a protective effect on ECM dep￾osition, airway obliteration, and epithelial injury. With sig￾nificant reductions of recruited leukocytes into the allo￾grafts from CCR2–/– mice, we evaluated whether this
affected matrix deposition, airway obliteration, and
epithelial integrity. Specifically, decreased recruitment
of activated leukocytes to the allograft basement mem￾brane and submucosa may delay the fibro-obliterative
changes of BOS. Histopathological analysis of allo￾grafts from the CCR2–/– recipients on days 3–14 demon￾strated minimal ECM deposition, airway obliteration,
and loss of epithelial cell integrity with occasional areas
of hypertrophy and hyperplasia (Figure 7). Day 21 allo￾grafts from the CCR2–/– recipients demonstrated an
increase in ECM matrix deposition, moderate airway
obliteration, and a moderately severe epithelial injury
including areas of metaplasia (Figure 7). Day 3 allo￾grafts from the CCR2+/+ mice demonstrated injury con￾sistent with ischemia-reperfusion injury (data not
shown). Day 7–14 allografts demonstrated a temporal
increase from moderate to severe ECM deposition, air￾way obliteration, and severe epithelial injury with
increased metaplasia (Figure 7). Day 21 allografts from
the CCR2+/+ recipients demonstrated very severe ECM
deposition, airway obliteration, and a denuded, meta￾plastic, thin layer of remnant epithelium, all consistent
with progressive fibroproliferative changes (Figure 7).
We further quantitated these findings by measuring
hydroxyproline levels. There was a significant reduction
in hydroxyproline levels at days 14 and 21 from CCR2–/–
mice compared with those from CCR2+/+ mice (Figure
8a). To investigate whether this reduction in allograft
inflammation and fibro-obliteration was due to a dif￾ference in immune responses between the CCR2–/– and
CCR2+/+ mice, we studied MCP-1 and CCR2 expression
in allografts from the CCR2–/– (BALB/c tracheas trans￾planted to CCR2–/–) versus CCR2+/+ (BALB/c tracheas
transplanted to CCR2+/+) recipient mice. There was no
difference in MCP-1 expression (Figure 4c). There was
less expression of CCR2 from the CCR2–/– versus
CCR2+/+ allografts do to donor BALB/c cells (Figure
5b). In addition, we performed experiments: (CCR2–/–
on C57BL/6 background tracheas to BALB/c) versus
(CCR2+/+ on C57BL/6 background tracheas to BALB/c)
mice and found no difference in hydroxyproline levels
at day 21 (Figure 8b). Moreover, to further probe the
role of MCP-1/CCR2 signaling during the pathogene￾sis of BOS, we performed experiments using neutraliz￾552 The Journal of Clinical Investigation | August 2001 | Volume 108 | Number 4

MCP-1 significantly reduced hydroxyproline levels at
day 21 compared with NRS (Figure 8c).
Discussion
BOS results from a chronic immunological/inflam￾matory insult to the allograft airways. This leads to a
persistent peribronchiolar leukocyte infiltration, fol￾lowed by an aberrant repair and fibro-obliteration of
the airways. In this study, we hypothesized that the per￾sistent expression of MCP-1 during the allogeneic
response, with subsequent recruitment of activated
mononuclear cells expressing CCR2, is pivotal for the
promotion of the pathogenesis of BOS.
We assessed whether MCP-1 was associated with the
continuum of lung allograft rejection from human
acute to chronic rejection. We found significant
increases in levels of MCP-1 in BALF from patients
with acute rejection and BOS, compared with those
found in healthy lung transplant recipients. The ele￾vated levels of MCP-1 were biologically active as deter￾mined by mononuclear cell chemotaxis. Immunolocal￾ization demonstrated that both airway epithelium and
mononuclear cells were the predominant cellular
sources of MCP-1. This association between MCP-1
and both acute and chronic allograft rejection has been
identified in animal models of both heart and renal
transplantation (21, 22). Both acute and chronic lung
allograft rejection depend on the recruitment of peri￾bronchial leukocytes, which, when persistent, eventu￾ally leads to fibro-obliteration of the allograft airway
(14). This suggests that MCP-1 produced predomi￾nantly from recruited and trapped mononuclear cells
is critically important in the continuum from acute to
chronic lung allograft rejection by causing persistent
accumulation of peribronchiolar leukocytes. In further
support of these findings, MCP-1 has been associated
with other human chronic inflammatory/fibroprolif￾erative diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
and abdominal adhesions (23, 24). Together these find￾ings suggest an association between augmented levels
of MCP-1 and the fibrogenesis involved in human
chronic inflammatory/fibroproliferative diseases.
To determine whether MCP-1/CCR2 signaling con￾tributes to the pathogenesis of human BOS, we per￾formed translational studies using a murine model of
BOS. We found allografts undergoing BOS had
increased procollagen expression, hydroxyproline lev￾els, and histopathology demonstrating increased
matrix deposition. Consistent with our human data,
we found marked elevations of MCP-1 in allografts
undergoing BOS compared with those found in syn￾geneic controls. Immunolocalization demonstrated

airway columnar epithelium and mononuclear cells as
the predominant sources of MCP-1. Furthermore,
MCP-1 levels during murine BOS paralleled the recruit￾ment of mononuclear cells. The association between
MCP-1 and a mononuclear phagocyte–predominant
leukocyte infiltration is supported by other studies of
solid organ chronic allograft rejection (14, 21). In rat
models of chronic cardiac and lung allograft rejection,
there were increases in expression of MCP-1 that
remained markedly elevated throughout their respec￾tive time courses (14, 21). Furthermore, in a rat model
of chronic renal allograft rejection, increased MCP-1
expression correlated best with the recruitment of
macrophages compared with that of lymphocytes (22).
These findings demonstrate the important relation￾ship between augmented expression of MCP-1 and
mononuclear phagocyte infiltration during chronic
allograft rejection.
With regard to the prolonged production of MCP-1
in the continuum from acute to chronic allograft
rejection, previous studies have demonstrated that
the proximal proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α is
expressed during an allogeneic response in human
mononuclear cell mixed lymphocyte response (MLR)
(25). In addition, TNF-α induced the prolonged
expression of MCP-1 during this response (25), and in
vitro neutralization of TNF-α downregulated the pro￾duction of MCP-1 (25). We have confirmed these data
with murine splenocytes MLR (C57BL/6 responder
cells to BALB/c stimulator cells), and murine cocul￾ture experiments between murine C57BL/6 PBMCs
and BALB/c fibroblasts (data not shown). Further￾more, during murine BOS there is a marked elevation
of TNF-α in allografts compared with that of syn￾geneic controls (data not shown).
CCR2 expression paralleled both MCP-1 and mononu￾clear cell recruitment during BOS. Similarly, other stud￾ies of chronic inflammatory diseases such as murine
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and rat
induced glomerular fibrosis have demonstrated similar
findings (26, 27). These studies support our data, sug￾gesting an association between augmented levels of
MCP-1 and recruitment of mononuclear cells expressing
CCR2 during chronic inflammation/fibrogenesis.
To determine the role of MCP-1/CCR2 signaling in
leukocyte recruitment during the pathogenesis of
murine BOS, we performed allogeneic tracheal trans￾plants in CCR2–/– versus CCR2+/+ recipient mice. We
found allografts from CCR2–/– mice demonstrated sig￾nificant reductions in mononuclear phagocytes

throughout the entire 21-day time course. Importantly,
this was not accompanied by significant reductions in
lymphocytes. This demonstrates that the phenotypical￾ly distinct mononuclear phagocyte expressing CCR2 is
pivotal during the pathogenesis of BOS. Other studies
using CCR2–/– mice have shown that these mice have
impaired mononuclear cell adhesion to endothelium,
specifically a defect in mononuclear phagocyte extrava￾sation and accumulation in tissue (17, 28). Further￾more, the importance of mononuclear phagocytes dur￾ing rejection was demonstrated in a human study of
chronic renal allograft rejection. There was a significant
increase in infiltrating interstitial macrophages without
any change in interstitial lymphocytes (29). Similarly, in
another human study there was a correlation between
deterioration in renal graft function and infiltrating
mononuclear phagocytes (30). In addition, macrophage
depletion in rat models of both orthotopic corneal and
small bowel transplantation significantly attenuated
rejection (31, 32). These studies, together with our data
demonstrating reductions of mononuclear phago￾cyte–derived chemokines, suggest the decreased num￾ber of recruited mononuclear phagocytes interacting
with T cells and other stromal cells leads to the reduc￾tion of specific cytokines, chemokines, and growth fac￾tors, in part, attenuating BOS.
With regard to neutrophils, there was an early reduc￾tion at day 7, possibly reflecting a protective role for the
CCR2–/– mutation during the neutrophil predominant
leukocyte extravasation of ischemia reperfusion. In
vitro, MCP-1 is chemotactic for mononuclear cells, but
not neutrophils (33). However, neutrophils in an
inflammatory milieu can express CCR2, potentially
enabling their chemotaxis to MCP-1 (34). In addition,
day 7 CCR2–/– allografts had reduced levels of the neu￾trophil chemoattractant MIP-2, as compared to
CCR2+/+ allografts. This is similar to what was demon￾strated in a murine model of Cryptococcus pneumo￾nia, where in vivo depletion of MCP-1 resulted in
reduced numbers of monocytes as well as their secret￾ed cytokines and chemokines, thereby indirectly
decreasing neutrophil infiltration (9).
Finding significant reductions of infiltrating leuko￾cytes into the allografts from CCR2–/– recipient mice, we
next assessed these effects on fibro-obliterative changes.
Histopathological assessment of allografts from the
CCR2–/– mice demonstrated significantly less matrix
deposition, airway obliteration, and epithelial injury
throughout the 21-day time course. These findings are
similar to the effect of granuloma formation in CCR2–/–
mice, which demonstrate a decrease in recruitment of
mononuclear phagocytes associated with decreased
fibroproliferation and expression of procollagens (16,
17, 28). Similarly, in a murine model of atherosclerosis,
CCR2–/– crossed with ApoE–/– mice displayed a marked
reduction in vessel obliteration secondary to a reduc￾tion in recruited mononuclear phagocytes within the
lesions (35, 36). Furthermore, in a murine model of
influenza A–induced pneumonitis, CCR2–/– mice
demonstrated a marked reduction in pulmonary
inflammatory cells and airway epithelial injury (37).
Similarly, we demonstrated a significant reduction in
early epithelial injury, implying decreased recruitment
of mononuclear phagocytes and their secreted
chemokines, and that decreased infiltration of neu￾trophils to the submucosal regions of the airways has a
protective role during early alloreactive epithelial airway
injury. However, the increased injury at day 21 suggests
that the inhibition of MCP-1/CCR2 signaling only
attenuates and delays airway epithelial injury. Further￾more, allograft bronchiolar epithelium can express
MHC class II antigens and has antigen-presenting func￾tions similar to those of dendritic cells (38). Like the
dendritic cell, the epithelial cells may have paradoxical
interactions with mononuclear phagocytes depending
on the local milieu (39). This suggests epithelial￾mononuclear phagocyte interaction during the chron￾ic inflammatory phase of BOS even in the CCR2–/– mice
may have an injurious effect on epithelial cells.
To determine whether a significant difference in the
immune response from the CCR2–/– versus CCR2+/+
mice could account for the attenuation of BOS, we
evaluated levels of MCP-1 from BALB/c tracheal allo￾grafts from CCR2–/– versus CCR2+/+ recipient mice and
found no difference. Experiments using CCR2–/– versus
CCR2+/+ (C57BL/6 background) tracheas transplanted
into recipient BALB/c mice demonstrated no difference
in fibro-obliteration. Similarly, there was no difference
in MCP-1 and CCR2 expression from these allografts
(data not shown). Therefore, it is the unique nature of
the CCR2–/– recipient mice that dictates the reduction
of recruited mononuclear phagocytes in response to
the production of MCP-1 during allogeneic injury. Fur￾thermore, neutralizing antibodies to MCP-1 in allo￾grafts (BALB/c tracheas transplanted into recipient
C57BL/6 mice) significantly attenuated fibro-oblitera￾tion, solidifying the involvement of MCP-1/CCR2 sig￾naling in BOS. Taken together, these findings suggest
a direct role for MCP-1/CCR2 signaling in the recruit￾ment of mononuclear phagocytes, granulation tissue
formation, and lumenal obliteration in response to an
injured airway from an allogeneic response.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that MCP-1, as
well as its interaction with its major mononuclear cell
receptor CCR2, plays a pivotal role in mediating the per￾sistent peribronchiolar mononuclear cell infiltration that
leads to fibro-obliteration during BOS. The fact that
there are still mononuclear phagocytes in our allografts
from CCR2–/– recipients, albeit reduced in number, sug￾gests that other chemokines may have a role during BOS.
The study of MCP-1/CCR2 signaling and future studies
of other CC and CXC chemokines and there interaction
with their appropriately expressed receptors will lead to
the development of new paradigms to understand the
pathogenesis of chronic lung allograft rejection. The
findings in this study may ultimately result in novel ther￾apies designed to attenuate MCP-1/CCR2 signaling and
lead to better interventions in the treatment of BOS.
