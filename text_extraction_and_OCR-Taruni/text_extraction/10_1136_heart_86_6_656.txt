Abstract
OBJECTIVE To determine whether cardiac iodine-123
metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I MIBG) imaging is useful in
predicting the prognosis of patients with chronic heart failure.
DESIGN Cardiac 123I MIBG imaging was done on entry to the study.
The cardiac MIBG washout rate was calculated from anterior chest
view images obtained 20 and 200 minutes after injection of the
isotope. Study patients were divided into two groups with washout
rates above and below 27% (the mean value + 2 SD obtained in 20
normal subjects), and were then followed up.
SETTING Tertiary referral centre.
PATIENTS 79 patients with chronic heart failure in whom the left
ventricular ejection fraction was less than 40%.
RESULTS There were 37 patients in group 1 (washout rate of ⩾ 
27%) and 42 in group 2 (< 27%). During a follow up period of
between 1 and 52 months, eight patients died suddenly and five
died of worsening heart failure in group 1, while none died in group
2; 13 patients in group 1 and four in group 2 were admitted to
hospital for progressive heart failure. Kaplan–Meier analysis showed
that group 1 had a significantly higher mortality and morbidity (p 
= 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively) than group 2.


CONCLUSIONS Cardiac 123I MIBG washout rate seems to be a good
predictor of prognosis in patients with chronic heart failure.
