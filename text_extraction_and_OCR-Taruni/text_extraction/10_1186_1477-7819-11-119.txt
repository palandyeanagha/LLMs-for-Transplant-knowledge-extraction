Abstract
Renal oncocytomas are benign tumors of the kidneys, which are usually diagnosed postoperatively, due to
differential diagnostic problems, from a sample of a renal cell carcinoma. The development of a renal oncocytoma
in the native kidneys following renal transplantation is a very rare condition and only a few cases have been
published in the world literature. In this case report we present a unique case of bilateral multifocal renal
oncocytomas of the native kidneys in a female transplant recipient 6 years after renal transplantation. The patient’s
postoperative clinical course was uneventful and no local recurrence or distant metastasis has been found so far.
The pathology, clinical characteristics, and treatment of renal oncocytomas are also reviewed.
Keywords: Renal oncocytoma, Renal masses, Renal transplantation, Renal cell carcinoma
Background
In 1942, Zippel was the first to describe renal oncocytomas
(ROs) [1-4]. ROs are typically uncommon benign, soli￾tary, epithelial tumors with an incidence between 3% to
7% of all primary renal solid tumors [4]. This particular
type of tumor has been described in many different or￾gans including the thyroid, salivary glands, parathyroid,
pituitary gland, pancreas, adrenal cortex, prostate and
kidneys [3,5]. ROs are rarely multiple and/or bilateral.
In 95% of cases the tumor is localized unilaterally, while
multiple tumors are observed only in 5% of cases [2,4,5].
The common age of observation is the seventh decade
of life, with predominance in the male sex (1.6:1). The
size of a tumor may vary between 0.6 cm to 14 cm [4].
The oncocytic cell type, which was first described by
Hamperl, expresses the electron-microscopic and im￾munohistochemical characteristics of the intercalated
cell type A of the collecting duct and usually grows in
an acinar pattern [2,3,6]. Accurate diagnosis and differ￾entiation from the chromophobe type of renal cell
carcinoma (RCC) can be challenging and requires
microscopic, ultrastructural and immunohistochemical
evaluation [2,4]; diagnosis is invaluable in planning
treatment.
Development of a RO in the native kidneys following
renal transplantation (RT) is very uncommon with only
four cases published in the world literature [7-10]. We
report herein the first case of a bilateral multifocal RO
of the native kidneys in a female transplant recipient 6
years after RT.
Case presentation
In June 2005, a female patient underwent an ABO￾matched deceased-donor RT for end-stage renal disease
(ESRD). Her past medical history was significant for
chronic renal disease for 11 years, possibly as a conse￾quence of long-standing poorly controlled hypertension
and hypercholesterolemia with resulting atherosclerotic
disease. She required hemodialysis over the preceding 8
years. During the pre-transplant evaluation, ultrasound
examination revealed a few simple renal cysts throughout
the reduced-size kidneys and no solid masses could be
detected. The gallbladder was free of calculi. The initial
immunosuppressive regimen consisted of cyclosporine A
(CsA), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and prednisone
according to our protocol at the time. The donor was a
69-year-old female with no history of tumors and good
renal function.

Six years after RT, the patient presented with epigastric
pain and abdominal discomfort over the right upper quad￾rant. Laboratory investigations, including kidney and liver
biochemical profiles, were within normal range. Ultrason￾ography demonstrated microlithiasis of the gallbladder,
without any signs of acute cholecystitis or dilatation of the
biliary tree. There were multiple solid, low-echogenic and
inhomogeneous masses incidentally confirmed in both
native kidneys. Normal renal transplant perfusion was
demonstrated by means of color-coded duplex sonography
of the renal graft. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) was performed, which revealed multiple bilateral
solid renal masses without any obvious lymphadenopathy
or vascular involvement (Figure 1).
A percutaneous biopsy was non-diagnostic due to the
lack of vital tissue. Due to the multiplicity of the lesions
and the concern that it was a renal cell carcinoma, in
November 2011 the patient, now 64 years old, underwent
a transabdominal bilateral nephrectomy and simultaneous
cholecystectomy.
Histological assessment revealed multiple bilateral renal
oncocytomas (oncocytomatosis) ranging in size from 1 cm
to 7.5 cm, replacing most of the renal parenchyma and
pelvis of both kidneys. Additionally small cystic changes
were identified. Surgical margins and the perirenal fat
were free of tumor. The neoplastic cells had an eosino￾philic, granular cytoplasm and monomorphic round ves￾icular nuclei (Figure 2). Immunohistochemical staining for
vimentin and CD10 was negative, while CK7 was locally
expressed within the tumor masses.
The postoperative course was uneventful and the pa￾tient was discharged home on the ninth postoperative
day. Currently the patient is tumor free and with normal
renal function. No further abnormalities were found at a
follow-up CT scan 12 months after the nephrectomy of
her native kidneys.
Discussion
ROs are classified as benign renal neoplasms in the 2004
World Health Organization classification of renal tumors
[11]. The tumor originates in the intercalated cells of the
distal collecting tubules. Several genetic abnormalities have
been associated with this type of tumor, such as deletions
in chromosome 1 and loss of chromosome Y or transloca￾tions involving chromosomal area 11q13 [4]. A family pre￾disposition to bilateral renal oncocytomas has been
observed [2]. Bilateral multicentric ROs are rare and diffuse
ROs are even rarer. In 1982, Warfel and Eble described
renal oncocytomatosis after identifying more than 200 foci
of ROs in one patient [11,12]. The term ‘oncocytomatosis’
should be strictly applied to cases in which oncocytomas
infiltrate the whole kidneys, as in our case [13], and correct
diagnosis is particularly problematic. Cases of metastatic tu￾mors have been documented [6,14], but subsequent reports
have identified subtypes of renal tumors with similar histo￾logical morphology but malignant potential. These tumors
have been classified as either eosinophilic variants of RCC
or chromophobe carcinomas [6]. ROs usually appear to be

unifocal, but a multifocal and bilateral appearance and con￾comitant RCC have been reported [2,5,15-20].
On the other hand, RT remains the best treatment
option for ESRD patients, regarding their survival and
quality of life. Solid-organ transplant recipients are con￾sidered to be at a significant risk of de novo malignancies
related to immunosuppressive therapy. The reported inci￾dence rate of de novo malignancy after RT ranges from 3%
to 26%, depending on the length of follow-up, pre￾transplant renal disease diagnosis, age distribution of the
patients, nature of the applied immunosuppression regi￾men and the type of malignancy; this incidence is quite
high compared to that of the general population. The
most common forms of malignancy within renal trans￾plant recipients are skin malignancies and non-Hodgkin
lymphomas [21]. However, carcinomas of the native
kidneys represent less than 5% of all malignancies found
in renal transplant recipients [22]; for this group of people
the risk of developing a RCC in the native kidneys, espe￾cially in those with acquired cystic kidney disease (ACKD),
is 15 times higher than in the normal population [23].
The differential diagnosis for bilateral, solid renal
masses includes RCCs, lymphomas, angiomyolipomas,
oncocytomas and metastatic disease. For our patient, a
bilateral RCC was the leading diagnostic concern given
the multiple bilateral solid renal masses especially in the
context of the RT. The radiographic presentation of
RCC is variable, depending on multiple factors including
size, location, extent of necrosis and hemorrhage [2]. A
RO was not specifically considered as a leading diagnostic
differential during the patient workup, due to the rarity of
a bilateral and multifocal growth pattern for a RO.
The diagnostic sequence for a RO is the same as for
other renal tumors, but no imaging technique offers
absolute certainty of RO diagnosis. CT scan and arteri￾ography findings such as hypodense enhancement after
intravenous contrast medium injection, a spoke-wheel
vascular formation pattern, a central scar area and the
absence of a rounded edge, may suggest the presence of
a RO [2,15]. However, these features can be present in a
RCC. Moreover, no differentiation using MRI is possible
[24]. On the other hand, radiology-guided bioptic proce￾dures can be useful for diagnosis, but they contain the
risk of seeding tumor cells. Especially for multifocal,
bilateral solid tumors, as in our case, it is not possible to
establish a safe diagnosis.
Microscopically, ROs are characterized by round or
polygonal cells that are eosinophilic epithelial cells called
oncocytes with a mitochondria-rich cytoplasm arranged
in trabecular or tubular patterns [2,4,10]. Histological
differential diagnosis from a chromophobe RCC is very im￾portant and can be challenging. The presence of cytokeratin
7 would hint at a RCC. Expression of cytokeratin 20 would
hint at a urothelial neoplasm [15].
The differential diagnosis of native kidney solid tumors
in renal transplant recipients is difficult and challenging.
It is typically an incidental finding during ultrasound
examination or a CT scan for other clinical conditions.
Furthermore, only four cases of renal transplant recipients
with oncocytomas in the native kidneys have been
reported in the literature. Rostaing et al., and Cofán et al.
[7,8] each describe one RT recipient, who developed a
solitary oncocytoma in a native kidney up to 9 years post
RT. Moreover, Turney and Harnden [9] reported another
solitary oncocytoma of a native kidney in a short-term
transplant recipient observed 1 year post RT. Riehl et al.
[10] discuss a young renal-graft recipient who developed a
solitary RO in a native kidney with ACKD, 4 years after
RT. In this case report, we present a unique case of renal
oncocytomatosis of the native kidneys in a renal transplant
recipient with normal graft function, 6 years following RT.
Conclusions
Until a pre-surgical diagnosis is available, surgery is the
first-line treatment. The classical approach to a solid
renal mass has been in general a radical nephrectomy in
cases with adrenal gland involvement, due to the high prob￾ability of the lesion being a RCC. In solitary tumors less
than 4 cm in diameter a nephron-sparing procedure (open
or laparoscopic partial nephrectomy) is recommended [25].
In cases with a bilateral multifocal RO, radical nephrectomy
could be advised.
