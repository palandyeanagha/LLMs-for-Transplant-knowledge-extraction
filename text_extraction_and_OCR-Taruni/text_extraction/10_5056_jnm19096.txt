Background/Aims
The pathophysiology of jackhammer esophagus (JE) remains unknown but may be related to gastroesophageal reflux disease 
or medication use. We aim to determine if pathologic acid exposure or the use of specific classes of medications (based on the 
mechanism of action) is associated with JE.
Methods
High-resolution manometry (HRM) studies from November 2013 to March 2019 with a diagnosis of JE were identified and compared 
to symptomatic control patients with normal HRM. Esophageal acid exposure and medication use were compared between groups. 
Multivariate regression analysis was performed to look for predictors of mean distal contractile integral.
Results
Forty-two JE and 127 control patients were included in the study. Twenty-two (52%) JE and 82 (65%) control patients underwent 
both HRM and ambulatory pH monitoring. Two (9%) JE patients and 14 (17%) of controls had evidence of abnormal acid exposure 
(DeMeester score > 14.7); this difference was not significant (P = 0.290). Thirty-six (86%) JE and 127 (100%) control patients had 
complete medication lists. Significantly more JE patients were on long-acting beta agonists (LABA) (JE = 5, control = 4; P = 0.026) 
and calcium channel blockers (CCB) (JE = 5, control = 3; P = 0.014). Regular opioids (β = 0.298, P = 0.042), CCB (β = 0.308, P
= 0.035), and inhaled anticholinergics (β = 0.361, P = 0.049) predicted mean distal contractile integral (R2
 = 0.082, F = 4.8; P = 
0.003).
Conclusions
Pathologic acid exposure does not appear to be associated with JE. JE patients had increased CCB and LABA use. The unexpected 
finding of increased LABA use warrants more investigation and may provide support for a cholinergic etiology of JE.

GERD Is Not Associated With Jackhammer Esophagus: A Case-control Study
Vol. 26, No. 2 April, 2020 (224-231)
Introduction 
Jackhammer esophagus (JE) is a relatively rare diagnosis 
appearing in only 4% of patients referred to a tertiary center for 
esophageal motility testing.1,2 Although dysphagia and chest pain 
are common in JE patients, dysphagia has been demonstrated to 
correlate with contractile vigor.3
The pathophysiology of jackhammer contractions is poorly 
understood, but multiple theories have been proposed. Early acid 
perfusion studies have demonstrated the ability of acid to induce 
esophageal spasms, suggesting a role for gastroesophageal acid 
reflux (GERD) in the pathogenesis of JE.4,5 This theory has been 
supported by the higher than expected rate of GERD seen in JE 
patients, and the observation that hypertensive peristalsis has been 
shown to improve with suppression of gastric acid.2,4,6 
Furthermore, JE may be related to a hypercholinergic state. 
This theory is supported by several observations. Hypertensive con￾tractions arising from temporal asynchrony between contractions of 
circular and longitudinal esophageal muscle layers can be reversed 
with atropine.7,8 These abnormal contractions have also been ob￾served in patients following vagal nerve injury.9
 Lastly, diabetics 
with autonomic neuropathy had a higher frequency of multipeaked 
waves compared to patients without neuropathy, and these were re￾versed with atropine.10 Patients with nutcracker esophagus have also 
been shown to have abnormal neural inhibition with multiple rapid 
swallows, suggesting an underlying disorder of the enteric nervous 
system.11 Patients with spastic motor disorders of the esophagus 
have been shown to have thicker esophageal muscle, suggesting 
an element of outlet obstruction, and JE has been demonstrated in 
some cases to progress to achalasia.12-14
JE is thought to be associated with mechanical esophagogastric 
junction (EGJ) outflow obstruction, reflux disease, primary esopha￾geal muscle hyperactivity, distal esophageal diverticula, and opioid 
medications.2,5,15 Our goal is to assess the role of acid reflux and 
medication usage on the pathogenesis of JE.
We thus performed a retrospective case-control study comparing 
esophageal pH exposure and medication use between patients with JE 
and symptomatic controls (SCs) with normal esophageal manometry. 
Materials and Methods 
Patient Selection
Consecutive high-resolution manometry (HRM) studies from 
symptomatic patients referred for motility testing at the Calgary Gut 
Motility Center (Calgary, Canada), who consented to have HRM 
data retrospectively analyzed are included in the Calgary Motility 
Databank (REB15-1331). This databank contains deidentified 
manometric data and medication lists, but no other patient informa￾tion (such as comorbidities or subsequent treatments). 
From this databank, adults (> 18 years of age) who underwent 
HRM between April 2014 and March 2019 were included in the 
study. All patients underwent gastroscopy prior to HRM; all pa￾tients with a structural cause of dysphagia were excluded. The study 
was conducted with approval by the conjoint health research ethics 
board at the University of Calgary (REB18-1480). 
HRM studies were reviewed and interpreted as per Chicago 
classification version 3.0 (v3.0). Studies were identified as “jack￾hammer esophagus” if they had ≥ 20% of swallows with a distal 
contractile integral (DCI) > 8000 mmHg∙sec∙cm and normal 
relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES; integrated relax￾ation pressure [IRP] ≤ 15 mmHg).16 They were compared to “SC 
patients” defined as symptomatic patients with normal manometries 
(no disorders of EGJ outflow obstruction, major or minor disorders 
of peristalsis) collected between November 2013 and March 2015. 
We chose symptomatic patients undergoing HRM (as opposed to 
asymptomatic patients) to increase the clinical generalizability of our 
findings.
Baseline variables such as age, gender, ambulatory pH study 
results, and medication use (if available) were collected to identify 
predictors of JE.
High-resolution Manometry
HRM studies were performed with a manometry catheter with 
36 circumferential sensors spaced one centimeter apart (Medtronic, 
Minneapolis, MN, USA) inserted transnasally to span the entire 
length of the esophagus. After a short acclimation period, a mini￾mum of 10 wet swallows of 5-mL boluses of a mixture of 1:1 nor￾mal saline and apple juice were given at least 30 seconds apart from 
each other, in the upright position. 
A subset of patients referred for manometry also underwent 
pH monitoring either with a 24-hour disposable transnasal pH 
catheter (Medtronic) or Bravo pH wireless capsule attached via a 
mucosal suction (Medtronic). A proportion of these patients under￾went ambulatory pH monitoring on acid suppressive therapy with a 
proton pump inhibitor (PPI). 
Outcomes Measurement
The primary outcome measure was quantifying differences,

in terms of esophageal acid exposure, between patients with a 
manometric diagnosis of JE and symptomatic patients with normal 
HRM. Acid exposure was quantified by the DeMeester score, a 
composite score that includes 6 weighted criteria: total percent time 
pH < 4, percent upright time pH < 4, percent supine time pH < 
4, number of reflux episodes, number of long reflux episodes (> 5 
minutes), and longest reflux duration. A score > 14.72 is consid￾ered abnormal.17 The % of total time pH < 4 and total number of 
long reflux episodes are considered the most sensitive parameters.18 
We included SC patients with pathologic acid exposure and normal 
manometries, as motor abnormalities in GERD may not necessarily 
involve the tubular esophagus, and we wanted to have a clinically 
representative control group.19 
Secondary outcomes included: (1) examining differences 
between JE and control patients in terms of medication use, and 
(2) examining predictors of mean DCI. Medication classes were 
chosen a priori for analysis and had a pathophysiologic basis for af￾fecting esophageal peristalsis by mechanism of action. 
Statistical Methods
Data are presented as frequencies (percentages) or median 
(range). Comparisons between groups were performed using Fish￾er’s exact or Pearson’s chi-squared in the case of categorical vari￾ables, or ANOVA in the case of continuous variables. Odds ratios 
(95% CI) were calculated for medication usage. Stepwise logistic 
linear regression was performed to determine predictors of mean 
DCI. A logarithmic transformation was performed on the outcome 
variable as it was not normally distributed. A 2-sided P-value < 0.05 
was significant for all calculations. Calculations were done in SPSS 
version 23 (IBM, New York, USA). 
Results 
Baseline Characteristics and High-resolution 
Manometry
Three thousand three hundred thirty-one patients underwent 
HRM between April 2014 and March 2019 and provided consent 
to having their data retrospectively analyzed. Of these, 42 patients 
(1.3%) met the criteria for JE and were compared to 127 SC pa￾tients. 
There was no significant difference in age or sex between the 
JE or SC groups. The JE patients’ primary complaints were dys￾phagia (52%) and chest pain (24%). Significantly more JE patients 
presented with dysphagia (52% vs 31%, P = 0.010), but the other 
presenting symptoms were similar between groups. See Table 1 
for further demographic details. The distal latency, mean DCI, 
maximum DCI, basal LES pressure, IRP, and incomplete bolus 
clearance were all significantly higher in patients with JE when 
compared to SC. (Table 2). 
Esophageal Acid Exposure
Twenty-two (52%) JE and 82 (65%) SC patients underwent both 
HRM and ambulatory pH monitoring. Two (9%) JE and 14 (17%) 
SC patients had evidence of abnormal acid exposure (defined as a De￾Meester score > 14.7); this difference was not significant (P = 0.290). 
There were no differences seen in any other acid reflux parameters 
(Table 3). There were no significant differences seen in PPI use be￾tween groups (JE 11 patients [50%] vs SC 42 [51%], P = 0.555).
Medication Use
Thirty-six (86%) JE and 127 (100%) SC patients had com￾plete medication lists. In terms of medications, significantly more 
JE patients were on LABA (JE = 5, SC = 4; P = 0.026, OR 5.0 
[1.3-19.6]) and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) (JE = 5, SC 
= 3; P = 0.014, OR 6.7 [1.5-29.4]). There was no significant 
difference in age or gender between JE and SC patients, who were 
on LABA or CCBs. No other medication classes were significantly 
different between groups (Table 4). 
Three variables predicted mean DCI (R2
 = 0.082, F = 4.8, 
P = 0.003). Regular opioids (β = 0.298, P = 0.042, 95% CI = 
0.010-0.586), CCB (β = 0.308, P = 0.035, 95% CI = 0.022-
0.593), and inhaled anticholinergics (β = 0.361, P = 0.049, 95% 
CI = 0.001-0.721) were included in the regression equation. Sex, 
age, prokinetics, selective norepinephrine receptor inhibitor, beta 
blockers, and LABA were excluded from the equation. The final 
model including regular opioids, CCBs, and inhaled anticholiner￾Table 1. Demographics

Discussion 
We performed a retrospective case-control study comparing 
esophageal acid exposure in patients with JE vs SC patients with 
normal HRM. A secondary analysis was performed to examine 
medication usage between both groups. Our analysis demonstrated 
that patients with JE do not appear to have an increased incidence 
of abnormal acid exposure. Furthermore, more JE patients were on 
LABA, and CCBs compared to SC. Regular opioid use, CCBs, 
and inhaled anticholinergics were positive predictors of DCI. 
Strengths of this study include the fact that although this study 
was retrospective, all manometries were reviewed to ensure they met

the Chicago classification v3.0 definition of JE, which demonstrates 
higher specificity and symptom correlation.16 Furthermore, we ex￾cluded patients with outflow obstruction, as per Chicago classifica￾tion v3.0.16
However, our study has several weaknesses that must be ac￾knowledged. Given our use of a deidentified HRM database, we 
did not have access to patient’s medical comorbidity information. 
This made it challenging to eliminate the possibility of specific 
comorbidities being confounders. Our requirement for patients 
to meet the Chicago classification v3.0 definition of JE may have 
limited our study population; indeed, only 1.3% of HRMs over 
the study period had JE, a similar prevalence to other studies that 
use the same manometric criteria.20 While our study population 
of 42 JE patients is one of the larger cohorts in the published lit￾erature, only 22 (52%) had ambulatory pH testing and 36 (86%) 
had medication lists. Furthermore, we included a diverse group of 
patients with multiple comorbidities; thus many of the medications 
were present at low frequencies. As a result, even small changes in 
the distribution of medications in either the JE or SC groups may 
change our conclusions. The low numbers may have prevented us 
from detecting a significant difference in other medication classes 
and increases the likelihood of spurious findings; a limitation pres￾ent in many retrospective studies that seek to examine the contribu￾tion of medications to gastrointestinal motility disorders. Lastly, we 
did not collect doses of medications, which prevents us from estab￾lishing any dose-response relationship and while patient’s symptoms 
were reported at the time of HRM, we did not use validated symp￾tom indices, which prevents us from assessing the severity of symp￾tomology. Thus, our results and conclusions must be interpreted 
with caution. 
Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease and Jackhammer 
Esophagus
While gastroesophageal reflux has been implicated as a possible 
causative factor, based on the higher than expected incidence of 
GERD in patients with JE than seen in previous studies (43-47%), 
our research finds no association between distal esophageal acid ex￾posure and JE.4,6
Manometric resolution of JE has been documented in patients 
undergoing PPI therapy.2
 This lead to the suggestion that an em￾piric PPI trial may be reasonable.21 However, published data are 
conflicting. Mallet et al4
 found that PPI use was not associated with 
symptomatic improvement in a cohort of JE patients (with and 
without GERD) who underwent PPI therapy for a median of 21 
months. However, repeat manometry was not performed in these 
patients. A more recent study looked at 41 JE patients selected 
from a cohort of patients referred for anti-reflux surgery and found 
that similar proportions (43.2%) had GERD, compared to those 
without GERD, and there was no significant difference in PPI use 
between groups.20
The prevalence of abnormal acid exposure in our cohort (7.7%) 
was significantly lower than previously demonstrated, but most 
JE patients (65.3%) were on PPIs. Due to technical limitations, 
ambulatory pH studies did not report weakly acid reflux episodes, 
nor acid/weakly acid exposure time on impedance; however, there 
was no significant difference between total acid and non-acid reflux 
episodes on the studies with impedance monitoring. Thus, our in￾terpretation is 2-fold; GERD does not appear to be more common 
in JE patients compared to SC, and if GERD is to be implicated in 
the pathogenesis of JE, correction of esophageal acidification does 
not appear to cause resolution of hypercontractile peristalsis. 
Medication Use and Jackhammer Esophagus
Unexpectedly, significantly more JE patients were on CCBs 
and LABA compared to SC patients. Furthermore, regular opioid, 
calcium channel blocker, and inhaled anticholinergics were all posi￾tive predictors of mean DCI.
Our finding of increased CCB may be spurious. In a pro￾spective placebo-controlled trial of 5 healthy volunteers and 10 
nutcracker esophagus patients, oral CCB use was demonstrated 
to decrease the amplitude and duration of esophageal peristalsis in 
patients with nutcracker esophagus, although this reduction was 
not seen when compared to placebo.22 For this reason, CCB is often 
empirically used in the management of non-obstructive dysphagia 
and non-cardiac chest pain. 
However, this paradoxical observation has been seen in other 
similar studies seeking to elucidate the role of medications in hyper￾contractile esophagus. Schupack et al23 noted that smooth muscle 
relaxant medications (including calcium channel blockers) were 
significantly more common at presentation in 40 patients with hy￾percontractile esophagus compared to 33 symptomatic controls with 
normal HRM (20% vs 0%, P = 0.007). Furthermore Kamal et al24
reported that 4/13 (30.8%) patients with hypermotility esophageal 
disorders were on CCB, although this was not significantly different 
compared to healthy controls. It is conceivable that symptomatic pa￾tients in whom a motility disorder is being questioned may undergo 
a CCB trial prior to HRM. 
The finding of increased LABA use is also unexpected, given 
that oral and inhaled beta-adrenergic stimulation has been previ￾ously demonstrated to reduce LES pressure and contractile ampli-

229

tude of esophageal peristalsis in healthy patients.24-27 However, there 
is evidence that the genesis of jackhammer contractions is different 
than normal esophageal peristalsis and may involve a hypercholiner￾gic state.7-10 
The observed association between beta-agonist use and JE 
may be explained by modulation of acetylcholine signaling. Cho￾linergic excess, causing bronchoconstriction, has been implicated 
in increased mortality in asthma patients on LABA alone. This is 
supported by studies that show that in rat airway smooth muscle 
cells, persistent administration of beta-2 adrenergic agonists appears 
to mediate upregulation of muscarinic M3 receptors by a beta-2 
adrenoceptor/cyclic adenosine monophosphate signaling pathway.29
Muscarinic M3 receptors have been shown to induce contraction in 
human esophageal smooth muscle, and upregulation of these cho￾linergic receptors may result in hypertensive peristalsis.30
On the other hand, our finding may be confounded by the fact 
that LABA are generally used in the management of obstructive 
airway disease (eg, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary dis￾ease [COPD]). Patients with asthma may be more likely to have 
JE due to a hypercholinergic state. Acetylcholine is well known to 
play a role in asthma. Both animal and human models of allergic 
airway inflammation and asthma have implicated muscarinic M2
autoreceptor dysfunction in the exaggerated acetylcholine release 
seen in bronchial hypersensitivity.31 However, an increased M3
receptor abundance in canine tracheal myocytes is associated with 
an increased contractile phenotype, with significant shortening on 
acetylcholine exposure.32 Thus, patients with asthma and bronchial 
smooth muscle hyperreactivity may be more likely to have M3 me￾diated hypercontractility of the smooth muscle. Furthermore, there 
is evidence that a subset of asthmatics may have cholinergic hyper￾sensitivity. This may be due to the common embryological origin 
of the bronchial tree and the esophagus.33 Asthmatics with GERD 
have evidence of systemic cholinergic hyperresponsiveness, based 
on hypervagal response on autonomic testing.34,35 Unfortunately, 
we did not collect comorbidity information on our patients which 
prevents us from testing this inference; however, the indication for 
LABA would most likely be reactive airway disease (either asthma 
or COPD). 
Our findings of regular opioid use and inhaled anticholinergic 
use being a positive predictor of mean DCI overlap with what has 
been previously observed in the literature. The finding of opioid 
users having a higher DCI compared to non-users was observed by 
Ratuapli et al36 in a retrospective review of 121 chronic opioid users. 
Oral anticholinergics have been previously documented to decrease 
upright, post-prandial, esophageal peristaltic amplitude in healthy 
humans.37 However, contrary to this, Schupack et al23 found that 
75% of 56 patients with EGJ outflow obstruction and 40 patients 
with hypertensive esophagus were on oral anticholinergic medica￾tions. While they were not able to generate a plausible mechanistic 
association, they postulated that prior local evaluation resulting 
in nonspecific HRM findings could have lead to the initiation of 
anticholinergic medications such as Tricyclic antidepressants. In 
our case, this unexpected finding could be explained by in a similar 
fashion to the unexpectedly high number of patients on LABAs 
the presence of reactive airway disease being a confounder. The low 
level of variance in DCI (8.2%) accounted for by the regression 
equation supports the complexity of modulation of esophageal peri￾stalsis. 
Manometric Parameters in Jackhammer Esophagus
We found that patients with JE had a significantly higher basal 
LES, IRP, and distal latency than patients with normal esophageal 
manometries. This relationship was also observed by Schupack et 
al.23 Herregods et al3
 also noted that DCI correlated with IRP in 
a cohort of patients with JE. A normally-functioning esophagus 
should vigorously contract to propel bolus past a mechanical ob￾struction. The elevated LES and IRP may thus suggest an element 
of outflow obstruction in JE, not meeting the criteria for EGJ out￾flow obstruction (IRP > 15 mmHg).16 Conversely, this could also 
suggest a loss of inhibitory input.23
The finding of dysphagia being significantly more common 
in JE compared to SC patients is in keeping with findings of Her￾regods et al3
 who observed that dysphagia, but not chest pain, cor￾related with contractile vigor in a cohort of 34 patients with JE. 
Conclusion 
In summary, patients with JE do not appear to have an in￾creased incidence of pathologic acid exposure compared to symp￾tomatic patients with normal HRM. Our study demonstrated 
increased LABA and CCB use among JE patients. This unex￾pected finding may yield some insight into the pathophysiology 
of JE, which is still poorly understood. To better understand their 
role, assessing esophageal function in patients who are on long-term 
LABA (eg, asthma patients) prospectively is required.
