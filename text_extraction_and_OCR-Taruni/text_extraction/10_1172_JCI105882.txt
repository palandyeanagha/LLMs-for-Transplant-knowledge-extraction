A B S T R A C T Rats were made acutely hyper- or
hyponatremic by infusion of hypertonic saline or
water, respectively. Other rats were maintained
in these states from 1 to 7 days to observe the
effects of time. Brain tissue water, Na, Cl, and K
were compared with serum Na and Cl concen￾tration (NaE and ClE). The following observations
are noted: Brain Cl content varies directly with
CIE and brain Na content in the Cl space (Nae)
varies directly with NaE, indicating little or no
restraint on the inward or outward movement of
Na or Cl from the Cl space of brain. The intra￾cellular volume of brain fluid (Vi) derived as the
difference between total water and Cl space, de￾creases with hypernatremia and increases with
hyponatremia. The changes in V, in the acute
studies are not accompanied by any change in
brain K content, or calculated intracellular Na
content, and are approximately 0.6 the changes
predicted from osmotic behavior of cells, which
apply four assumptions: (a) NaE is proportional
to osmolality; (b) brain osmolality remains equal
to plasma osmolality; (c) V1 is osmotically active;
and (d) there is no net gain or loss of solute from
Vi. The validity of these assumptions is consid￾ered. When changes in osmolality are sustained,
V1 is much closer to control values than when in
the acute phase. K content increases in hyper￾natremia and decreases in hyponatremia. The

changes in K content can account for some of the
adjustment in Vi observed over the extended
period of hyper- or hyponatremia. The regression
of (Na + K) /v upon NaE describes a slope less
than 1.0 and an intercept of (Na + K) /v equal
to 40% of the control (Na + K) /v. These charac￾teristics are interpreted to mean that significant
quantities of Na and K in brain are osmotically
inactive. The brain protects itself from acute vol￾ume changes in response to change in NaE .by the
freedom for Na and Cl to move from the Cl space,
by V1 not changing acutely to the degree predicted
from osmotic properties of cells in general, and by
significant quantities of Na + K in V1 being os￾motically inactive. With sustained changes in
osmolality, V1 approaches normal values and brain
K changes to account for part of this later adjust￾ment.
INTRODUCTION
Brain swelling and symptoms of brain dysfunction
occur with acutely induced hyponatremia sec￾ondary to water retention, i.e. water intoxication,
in clinical and experimental settings (1, 2). A de￾crease in brain volume has been demonstrated with
acutely induced hypernatremia (3) secondary to
hypertonic saline loading in experimental animals.
A similar phenomenon appears to occur in infants
with hypernatremia (4). A transient decrease in
brain volume is a well-established phenomenon,
consequent to the infusion of hypertonic solu￾tions (5).

Experimental studies (3, 6-1 1) have docu￾mented the changes in brain fluid and electrolyte
that occur with changes in osmolality that were
specific for each study. The results have usually
shown a change in brain Cl and Na content in the
direction of the change in concentration of C1 and
Na induced in plasma. Changes in K content in
the brain have been noted in some experiments
(6-9) but not in others (3, 10, 11). Except for
the early study by Yannet (6), there has been
little effort to generalize a quantitative relation
between changes in plasma osmolality to changes
in brain tissue water and electrolytes.
The effects of changes in plasma osmolality
upon brain fluid and electrolyte depend upon the
rate with which brain water equilibrates with
plasma water when a gradient in water potential
develops, and the degree to which brain solute
content is altered, since the latter influences the
final distribution of water. Because rates of ex￾change for water and solute vary, time is an im￾portant element in characterizing changes in brain￾fluid volume. This is evident in clinical experience:
hypertonic urea injections decrease brain volume,
because urea diffusion into brain water is relatively
slow and osmotic redistribution of water continues
until urea equilibrium is reestablished; rapid re￾duction of plasma urea concentration in uremia
by hemodialysis leads to transitory signs of brain
swelling (12) for the same reason. It is also evi￾dent that those patients who develop hyponatremia
slowly have fewer symptoms of central nervous
system dysfunction than do those who develop
it rapidly (13, 14).
The studies reported here are designed to com￾pare the effects of acute changes in plasma osmolal￾ity with those of sustained changes upon the Na
and Cl content of the brain, the fluid phases of
the brain, the K content, and the ratio of cation
to water in brain fluid. In particular, we have
compared the effects of changing osmolality upon
observed cell volume with that predicted from the
assumption that cell volume is a reciprocal func￾tion of osmolality (15').
METHODS
Two studies were carried out in young male Sprague
Dawley rats weighing 200-350 g. The experimental proto￾cols for each experimental group in the two studies are
as follows.
Study I (Groups 1-5)
Group 1. 13 normal rats fed an ordinary laboratory
diet were sacrificed as normal controls.
Group 2. Nine rats were made acutely hypernatremic
by intravenous infusion with a solution of 7.5% NaCl,
0.3 ml/min for 50-60 min, and sacrificed 60 min post￾infusion.
Group 3. 11 rats were made hypernatremic over 7 days
by substituting 5% saline for their usual drinking water.
Since their intake was erratic they were then gavaged to
receive 2 ml/day per 100 g of body weight of a 5% saline
solution, and were sacrificed after 6-7 days of this
regimen.
Group 4. 11 rats were made acutely hyponatremic with
a dose of 50 mU of Pitressin and infusion of a solution
of 1.5% glucose and 1.5% fructose, 0.3 ml/min per 100 g
for 50-75 min until they had gained about 15% of body
weight; then they were sacrificed within a few minutes.
Group 5. 12 rats were made hyponatremic over a
3 day period by giving them 50 mU of Pitressin in oil
daily, and 5-7 ml of water/100 g of body weight by
gavage every 6 hr for the three days; they were then
sacrificed.
Study II (Groups A-D)
This study was designed to compare quantitatively
similar degrees of hyponatremia of 1½ hr and 24 hr
duration. To control the degree of hyponatremia the
ureters in all rats were ligated at the beginning of the
experiment. No fluid or food was given except that noted
in the protocol for each group. Paired controls were stud￾ied in each experiment because uremia was a variable,
particularly in the 24-hr group.
Group A. 1/-hr control group. Seven rats were in￾fused with isotonic saline, 10 ml/100 g of body weight
over a period of 1 hr; 1% hr later they were sacrificed.
Group B. 1½/2-hr hyponatremic group. Seven rats were
infused with 2% glucose, 15 ml/100 g of body weight
over a period of 1 hr; 12 hr later they were sacrificed.
Group C. 24-hr control group. Seven rats were in￾fused as in Group A, but sacrificed 24 hr after infusion.
Group D. 24-hr hyponatremic group. Eight rats were
infused as in Group B, but sacrificed 24 hr after infusion.
The animals were sacrificed by exsanguination from
the aorta; the blood obtained was used for serum and
red cell analyses. The brain was removed whole, weighed
fresh, and weighed again after drying at 105°C in order
to obtain water content by the difference. The dry residue
was eluted with 10 ml of 0.75 N HNO3 (16). After
48 hr, aliquots of the eluate were taken for Na and K
analysis by flame photometry and Cl analysis with a
Cotlove chloridometer (17). In study II, serum glucose
was measured by the Somogyi-Nelson method (18),
serum urea by the method of Seligson (19), and serum
osmolality with a Fiske osmometer. Since the dry solids
of brain probably did not vary in these studies, fluid and
electrolyte values which are referred to dry weight of
brain reflect absolute changes in content.

Symbols and Calculations
The following symbols and calculations modified from
earlier studies (6, 16, 20-22) are used in developing the
results. NaE, concentration of, Na in extracellular fluid
(ECF), derived from serum Na concentration, Na., as￾suming a serum water content of 94% and a Donnan fac￾tor of 0.96 .'. NaE = Na, X 0.96/0.94; CIE, concentration
of Cl in ECF with the same assumptions as obtained for
calculating NaB .'. CIE = Cl, X 1/0.94 X 1/0.96; II,, the
effective osmolality of plasma and ECF, i.e., osmolality
corrected for NPN and glucose (22); Nat and Clt, Na
and Cl content, respectively, of brain as mEq/100 g of
dried weight of brain (100 DWB); Kt or K4 K content
of brain as mEq/100 DWB; no correction is made for
extracellular K; Vt, volume of total brain water as
ml/100 DWB; Vc1, volume of distribution of Cl/100
DWB calculated from the formula Vci = Clt/ClE; Vs,
fluid not in the volume of distribution of Cl and termed
the intracellular volume/100 DWB-the difference be￾tween Vt and Vc,; Na,, Na content/100 DWB calculated
to be in Vci, assuming its concentration in Vc, is equal to
NaE; Nai, intracellular Na content/100 DWB-the differ￾ence between Nat and Na6; (Nat + K,)/Vt, ratio of
Na plus K content to water content in brain (The term
avoids the necessity for making any assumptions about
extracellular volume in comparing the cation concentra￾tion of brain fluid with NaE.); (Na, + Ki)/Vi, ratio of
the sum of Na and K content in intracellular phase to the
water content of the intracellular phase.
The effect of a change in osmolality upon intracellular
volume can be predicted (15) by the following equation,
given the assumptions cited below:
pViz = pVic X NaEC/NaEx (1)
where pVt is the intracellular volume after a change
in osmolality; pV4C is the control intracellular volume;
NaE' is the control NaE; and NaE' is the new NaE repre￾senting a change in osmolality.
The validity of the prediction depends on the following
assumptions: (1) NaE is proportional to the effective
extracellular osmolality 11, (22) (2) IIJ = liB, where
HIB is intracellular osmolality (15, 23) (3) V4W is os￾motically active water bounded by a semipermeable mem￾brane; (4) Intracellular solute content of brain remains
unchanged (15).
It has been proposed that intracellular solute is, under
some conditions, proportional to intracellular K content,
K4 (24). In the experiments where K4 changes, equation
1 to predict pVss is amended as follows:
pV2 = (pVi X NaE/NaEZ) X K.2/Kic (2)
where K,' is the K4 of the experimental group and Kic
is the K, of the control group, and the fourth assumption
states that intracellular solute content is proportional
to Ki.
Regression equations are calculated by the method of
least squares. The standard error of the mean, standard
error of the slope, and correlation coefficient are calculated
by the usual formula adapted for use in the Olivetti
Programma 101. Differences between group averages are
compared by the standard t test.
RESULTS
The means and standard deviations of results for
each study are tabulated in Table I and I A for
both studies. Regression equations are collected
into Table II for reference. Because osmolality
was not measured in the first study, and because
changes in osmolality were effected only by wa￾ter loading and NaCl loading, NaE is used through￾out instead of II8 to reflect changes in I8. (II,
the effective osmolality, is not affected by uremia
(22).)
The regression of ClE upon _NaE (Table II) in￾dicates that the change in degree and direction of
ClE is similar to that of NaE. The slope of the re￾gression, 1.16, indicates ClE is changing slightly
more than NaE, probably due in part to the use
of hypertonic saline in the hypernatremic studies,
with an attendant dilutional acidosis. The slope of
almost 1.0, the correlation coefficient of nearly
0.98, and the standard error of the estimate of
< 10 affirm the parallelism of these variables.
The effect of changing CIE Upon Clt and NaE
upon Nat. The slope of regression for brain Cl
content, ClIt, upon ClE is cited in Table II and il￾lustrated in Fig. 1. The principal line is derived
only from the data from groups 1-5 (study I) and
data are plotted for each individual rat. The slope,
0.121, is very nearly the same as the ratio of Clt:
ClE for the controls (group 1). 0.129, and the in￾tercept is not significantly different from zero.
For comparison, the line of regression of Clt upon
ClE for groups A-D (study II) is also presented,
without a plot of individual points. The similarities
between the regressions of these separate and some￾what different experiments are evident. The slope
of the second regression, 0.117. is very nearly the
same as that for the first, and the intercept is not
significantly different from zero. The correlation
coefficient for each is high. It is concluded that
Clit, brain Cl content in these experiments, varies
as CIE, and that Cl in brain does not act as an
effective solute to increase or decrease brain vol￾ume. The change in ClE in these experiments is
proportional to changes in osmolality. Conse￾quently, it can be stated that the volume of distri￾bution of Cl in brain, Vc1, does not change and can
be considered in this sense as extracellular fluid.

In control group 1, study I (Table I), with the
assumptions described in the calculations, most
of brain Na content, Nat, is in Vcl. Nat for this
group is 22.49 mEq/100 DWB; of this, 18.31
mEq is in Vc1 (Nae) and only 4.18 mEq is in in￾tracellular fluid, Na1. When the regression of total
brain Na, Nat, upon NaE is analyzed, the slope
(Table II)is very nearly the same, 0.133, as that
noted for Clt upon CIE, 0.121. The intercept of this
regression is 4.55 mEq, significantly different from
zero and very similar to the calculated Na1 for the
control group, 4.18. From these relationships, it is
concluded that the Na calculated in V01, (Nae)
varies just as NaE, and Na6 does not act to in￾crease or decrease brain volume under the condi￾tions of these studies.
The Na, calculated for all the groups varies but
little, ranging from 4.01 to 6.72 mEq/100 DWB.
Although the total amount is small, Na, may act as
intracellular solute to change brain volume as
osmolality changes. This will be true only if Na4
is osmotically active.
All of these effects appear to be true for the
acute as well as for the chronic experiments, so
that no distinction is made between them. A pos￾sible exception is group 2 (acute hypernatremia)
where the gain in Clt and Nat in relation to the
control is slightly less than the increment in ClE
and NaE.
The results of this analysis lead to the predic￾tion that Vc1 calculated for each experimental
group will not vary inversely to ClE or NaE, as
it would if Na and Cl were restrained within the

brain and acted as an effective solute to change
brain volume. The actual values for the averages
of Vc1 for each experimental group are noted in
Table I. Although average Vc1 for some experi￾mental groups is significantly different from their
controls, the differences are small. In only one
instance (group 2, study I) is the change in Vci
statistically significant and reciprocal to the change
in NaE.
The effect of acute change in Nag upon VT.
Since brain solids are not affected in these experi￾ments and V01 changes very little, the changes in
brain volume are due almost entirely to changes
in the calculated intracellular fluid, Vi, and these
changes in V. are reciprocal to the changes in
NaE.
A regression of Vi upon the reciprocal of NaE'
has been derived. Since K is the principal solute in
V1, and since it does not change in the acute ex￾periments (groups 2, 4, and B), but does in the
chronic or sustained experiments (groups 3, 5, and
D), the regression analysis of Vj upon 141.5/NaE
is derived from the data in the acute experiments
of both studies (groups 1, 2, 4, A, and B) where
K content does not change (equation 1 and as￾1 In order to visualize the magnitude and direction of
changes in osmolality, the reciprocal of NaE for each
animal is multiplied by the average control NaE, 141.5.
In this way, all deviations in osmolality are related to a
control osmolality of 1.0. The reciprocal of osmolality
expressed in this way should be a linear function of Vt.
sumptions). The results are cited in Table II and
Fig. 2, in which the calculated line of regression
and lines defining 95% confidence limits of the
data are illustrated. The observed line of regres￾sion lies between a line representing Vi predicted
from equation 1, and one which defines V{ at its
control value. The slope of the line derived from
equation 1 is 231, which is the control Vi, since
control osmolality has been corrected to 1.0 and
the intercept by definition is zero. The slope of the
regression is 145, and the intercept is 89.8 or 90
ml, approximately 40% of the control Va. The
difference between the theoretical slope, 231, and
the observed slope, 145, is significant (0.001).
The observed changes in Vi defined by the regres￾sion equation depart significantly from the Vi pre￾dicted by equation 1 and the assumptions inherent
in it. However, the pattern of change in V½ as re￾ciprocal to NaE is evident and apparently linear.
The correlation coefficient is high, 0.92. The ra￾tio of the observed slope to that calculated from
equation 1 is 0.62 and is an approximation of the
degree to which the assumptions in equation 1
have applied.
The changes in V4 in the chronic experiments.
In groups 3, 5 (study I), and D (study II), the
changes in NaE were sustained 24 hr or more. In
each, Y(4 changed significantly from its control.
The individual values for Vi plotted against 141.5/
NaE for these chronic groups are compared (Fig.

3) with the regression lines derived from the acute
experiments (see Fig. 2) and their 95% confidence
limits. Much of the data from the chronic experi￾ments (groups 3, 5, and D) falls outside the 95%o
confidence limits. In several instances, despite
large changes in osmolality and NaE, the observed
V, is the same as the control V4 (horizontal line);
in these cases, brain volume attains its control size
despite a sustained change in osmolality.
The capacity of the brain to restore its volume
toward control values after the acute response may
be, in part, related to its capacity to alter solute
content. The principal solute, K, changes in each
of the chronic experiments. In chronic hyperna￾tremia, when Vi is increasing toward normal, Ki
increases by 4%o (group 3). In chronic hypona￾tremia, when Vi is decreasing toward normal, K4
decreases 16% (group 5), and 4%o (group D).
The Vi predicted from equation 2 2 for group 5
is 288 ml2 compared with the observed Vi of 255
ml, and a V4 predicted from equation 1 8 of 345.
The correction derived from the decrease in KY
brings the pV(O closer to that observed, but not
equal to it. If, however, the pVe for this group is

FIGURE 2 Regression of V4 upon the reciprocal of NaE with data from all the acute
studies. The reciprocal of NaE in each instance is multiplied by the average NaE of
control group 1, so that all changes in the reciprocal of NaE (141.5/NaE) are related
to a control value of 1.0. Hypernatremia is < 1.0, hyponatremia is > 1.0. The solid
line describes plot derived from equation 1 of V4 upon 141.5/NaE, so that the plot is
linear, the slope is equal to the control V+, and the intercept is zero. The horizontal
line describes V4 as constant with changing 141.5/Naz. The actual line of regression
(and its 95% confidence limits) lies between the two theoretical lines, closer to that
derived from equation 1.
141.5/Na derived from the acute experiments and
amended on the assumption that its solute content
and, hence, its volume decreases in proportion to
the decrease in K4, the calculated Vi is 256.4
This obviously compares well with the observed
figure of 255 ml. The errors implicit in these cal￾culations are too great to draw conclusions with
any confidence about a quantitative relation be￾tween V} and K,. However, it is fair to assert that
Vi of brain with sustained changes in osmolality
has a mechanism for adjusting its volume toward
normal from either direction, and that this is as￾4 pV4 = [145 (141.5/95.3) + 90] X 36.37/43.29 = 256 ml.
sociated with change in K content in the appropri￾ate direction.
K4 is not changed in group 4 (acute hyponatre￾mia) but is changed in group 5 (chronic hypo￾natremia). The change in NaE in group 5, how￾ever, is not only sustained, but is much greater,
95 mEq/liter, than that noted in group 4, 115
mEq/liter. To determine whether the lower K4 in
group 5 is due to the greater severity of hypona￾tremia or to the extended time, a comparison is
made in study II, groups B and D when the de￾gree of hyponatremia is the same but the time of
hyponatremia is different. With comparable de￾1922 M. A. HoUiday, M. N. Kalayci, and J. Harrah

FIGuRE 3 The theoretical lines and actual line of regression of V, upon 141.5/NaE are
reproduced, as derived in Fig. 2. The individual points illustrate the relation of V. to
141.5/NaE for all the chronic experiments of studies I and II, which are compared with
the acute. The points are much closer to the control V. and, in many instances, equal to
it despite changes in 141.5/Nau. Much of the data falls outside the 95%o confidence limits
of V., derived from the acute studies in Fig. 2.
grees of hyponatremia, Ki shows a definite decrease
after 24 hr, but no decrease after 11,4 hr, and V4
shows less increase after 24 hr than after 1% hr.
Consequently, time seems to be the important vari￾able in the change in K4 and this change is asso￾ciated with a lesser change in Va.
The regression of the ratio of cation content:
water content upon NaB in the brain when NaE is
changing. This relationship is explored to de￾termine the degree to which cation concentration
in brain fluid parallels osmolality or NaE:. Since
NaE is manipulated in these experiments, it is the
independent variable and the ratio of (Na + K):
V is the dependent variable. Results for the re￾gressions of (Nat + Kt) : Vt upon NaE for studies
I and II and the details of the regression analysis
for each are given in Table II, and the data from
study I is illustrated in Fig. 4. The slopes and the
intercepts are similar despite the fact that study
II contains no rats with hypernatremia and half
the rats are uremic. The slope in each instance is
less than 1.0. This is true although the ratio of
(Nat + Kt)/Vt is consistently higher than NaE
or (NaE + KE) (making any reasonable allowance
for KE). A large positive intercept is evident for
both regressions, 58.9 and 84.2, respectively. This
intercept is evidence that a significant portion of
brain cation is osmotically inactive. The correlation
coefficient for each regression is high, 0.96 and
0.86, respectively. This analysis avoids any arbi￾trary division of cation and fluid into extracellular
and intracellular phase.
Since the Na in Vc0 (Na6) has been shown to
vary as NaE (see Methods) and, therefore, to be

osmotically active, the remaining cation (NaN +
K,) should include all the osmotically inactive cat￾ion. Therefore, the regression of (Nat + Kj)/Vj
upon NaE calculated for study I defines a mean
cation concentration in intracellular fluid that is
higher-203.8; a slope that is less-O.81; and an
intercept that is greater-87.1, than that noted for
(Nat + Kt)/Vt (Table II).
By each analysis, the change in cation concentra￾tion in brain water varies, as NaE, and the cor￾relation is very high. In all three of the derived
regressions (Table II), the very appreciable in￾tercept implies that a significant percentage of
brain cation is osmotically inactive.
DIS CUS SION
The effects of changing CIE upon Clt and NaE
upon Nat. Na and C1 in brain and cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) differ from Cl and Na elsewhere in
the body in their relation to Cl and Na in plasma.
Equilibration of 36Cl and 22Na into brain is slow,
24 hr, compared with its equilibration into inter￾stitial and connective tissue (25, 26). The con￾centration of C1 and Na in CSF differ from ClE
and NaE so that some active transport process
must be postulated (27, 28). It would not be sur￾prising if a change in plasma concentration of CI
or Na is not accompanied by a proportional change
in brain C1 or Na. Yet in our experiments the
changes in brain Cl and Na are proportional, over
a wide range of concentration values and within a
few hours of time. In other studies this also ap￾pears to be the case when examined in specific ex￾amples (3, 6-11).
The character and magnitude of the extracel￾lular phase of brain has been the subject of much
conflicting information. In early studies, it was
assumed that "the Cl space," or Vcl, defined the
extracellular phase of brain (6). However, in
subsequent studies the values for the volume of
distribution of sulfate, thiosulfate, thiocyanate, inu￾lin, and sucrose were all very much lower than
Vc1 when plasma concentration of the tracer was
used in calculating the "extracellular phase" (29-
33). The values of each varied, but the extracel￾lular phase of brain was considered to be less than
5% of total brain from these data. Several obser￾vations from electronmicrographs were in accord
with these low values, since no intercellular spaces
could be identified (34, 35).
However, Van Harreveld (36) recently re￾examined this issue in detail. He found that impe￾1924 M. A. HoUiday, M. N. Kalayci, and J. Harrah

dance measurements of the brain were consistent
with an interstitial space much more of the order
of 20-30%o of brain weight than 4-5% (37). He
further demonstrated, by histochemistry, that Cl
is in interstitial spaces (38) and, by electron mi￾croscopy, that there is a substantial interstitial
space (39). This extracellular Cl is absorbed and
the interstitial space is obliterated promptly with
anoxia. In other studies, the volume of distribution
in brain of traditional extracellular markers has
been calculated, using concentration in cerebro￾spinal fluid rather than plasma in the calculation.
The results define values for ECF equal to or
slightly smaller than those predicted from V01.
Bourke, Greenberg, and Tower (40) found that
the thiocyanate space as calculated was equal to the
Cl space and was 30-38%o of brain weight. Su￾crose and inulin spaces were 22-30% of brain
weight, the higher values being observed in larger
brains. Other investigators (41, 42) demonstrated
that sulfate space was approximately 15-30%o of
brain weight. The true ECF of brain is probably
smaller by 5-10% than the Vc1 calculated (36).
Despite a blood-brain barrier separating Na and
Cl in plasma from that in brain and CSF, a rapid
and proportional change in brain Na and C1 oc￾curs in response to a changing concentration in
plasma. We propose, as a possible explanation,
that the Na and Cl content of brain is dependent
upon a process of filtration or transport of Na or
Cl (43) across the blood-brain barrier, in which
the NaE and/or CIE is substrate which, within the
physiological range, is limiting to the rate of filtra￾tion or transport. Within the framework of this
proposal the velocity of filtration or transport
within the ranges of "substrate" concentration will
be linearly related to NaE and CIE. Whichever of
the two, Na or Cl, is primarily determinant is not
apparent from our experiments. This capacity of
brain to regulate Na and Cl content quickly, so
that a brain ECF does not change, even in the
face of major and rapid change in osmolality, has
a valuable effect in limiting the change in brain
volume, since brain ECF is between 25 and 30%
of total brain weight.
The acute response of V, to changing NaE. The
responses of V, to acute changes in osmolality are
in the expected directions. Since the observed
changes in Vi in the acute studies are less than
those predicted by equation 1 (see Methods), the
assumptions inherent in this equation are in ques￾tion, or the true V, is smaller than the calculated
Vs. This latter is unlikely, because this would
mean that the calculated Vc1 is smaller than the
true ECF. The errors in calculating Vc0 are likely
to predict a Vc1 larger than the true ECF, not
smaller, (see Discussion) and hence V1 is likely
to be underestimated by our calculations, not over￾estimated.
The first assumption, that of relating II8 to NaE,
probably is correct, since all the changes in osmo￾lality are induced either by water or saline loading,
except where uremia coexists. Even then, it is
likely that NaE reflects a better measure of ef￾fective osmolality in relation to its effect on cell
volume than osmolality measured directly. Al￾though glucose and fructose infusions were used,
glycosuria did not occur in any experiment, and
in study II plasma glucose concentrations (Table
II) did not exceed 15 mOsm/liter, compared with
a control of 6 mOsm/liter.
The equality of brain osmolality to II., the sec￾ond assumption, may be less certain. Maffly and
Leaf (23), in measuring melting curves of tis￾sues from normal rats, found muscle, liver, and
kidney cortex to have a melting curve similar to
that of plasma. A slight discrepancy existed for
brain but they felt a systematic experimental er￾ror could account for the discrepancy. Stern and
Coxon (44), who measured the freezing point of
quick-frozen brains in rats, found a discrepancy
in osmolality between plasma and brain for nor￾mal rats. The discrepancy was greater in rats
with acute hyponatremia, and less with acute hy￾pernatremia. However, Brodsky, Applebaum, Den￾nis, Rehm, Miley, and Diamond (45), using a
technic similar to that of Stern and Coxon for mea￾suring tissue osmolality, found discrepancies (46)
with their technic, compared with a later technic
where no osmolar gradients between tissue and
plasma existed. Wise (47) reported gradients in
osmolality between plasma and CSF in patients
who received 3.6 g/kg of 20%o mannitol. The
gradients gradually dissipated over 2-3 hr after
the infusion. From these results, it is possible to
infer that osmolar gradients or differences in wa￾ter potentials may exist between brain tissue and
plasma, at least for periods of several hours.
There is also a possibility that some water in
the brain is osmotically inactive, contrary to the
Brain Volume Changes in Response to Hyper- and Hyponatremia 1925

third assumption. Water existing as an ice-like
lattice crystal on lipid or protein matrix has been
described as being osmotically inactive (48). Re￾cently, Savitz, Sidel, and Solomon (49) reported
studies in red cells which indicate that as much
as 20%, of red cell water is osmotically inactive.
In our studies -90 of 230 ml, or nearly 40%, of
brain water in normal rats would be osmotically
inactive. This is an extraordinary percentage of
total water to be osmotically inactive and this is
an unlikely explanation by itself.
The loss or gain of- solute not mirrored in
changes in K, may exist, contrary to assumption 4.
Inspection of Fig. 2 suggests that the discrepancy
of observed Vi from that predicted is rather
evenly distributed. Consequently the change in
solute content of Vi necessary to account for this
discrepancy would have to be proportional to the
change in NaE. A mechanism may exist in which
osmolality change leads to reciprocal changes in
osmotic coefficients, or aggregation of smaller
molecular species into larger ones. It has been
proposed before, that changes in cation dissocia￾tion may occur to effect changes in cell osmolality
(16); such a mechanism may apply in our studies.
In summary, it must be concluded that the as￾sumptions (15) underlying equation 1 apply to
the brain, but only to effect changes equal to ap￾proximately 0.6 that one would predict if the as￾sumptions were quantitatively correct. It is be￾yond the scope of these studies to determine which
of the assumptions must be modified.
The response of V, to sustained changes in NaE.
In sustained hyponatremia, the changes in K con￾tent are not only statistically significant but after
3 days are equal to 16%o of total Ki. These losses
of KE are associated with a further loss of cell
volume, without any important gains in cell Na
(Nat). The gains in K4 with hypernatremia are
small and, quantitatively, could influence V4 but
little.
Losses of Ki (approximately 10% of the total)
have been noted in previous studies of water load￾ing or salt depletion to induce hyponatremia (6-8),
where brains' were obtained from 3-48 hr after￾ward. In the more acute studies, where the brain
was removed promptly, no change in brain K was
noted (10, 11).
Sotos, Dodge, Meara, and Talbot (9) produced
acute hyperosmolality by mannitol loading in three
rabbits. This was accompanied by an increase in
brain K content; a small increase in K4 in their
study may have occurred with acute saline loading.
In the study of Finberg, Luttrell, and Redd (3)
acute hypernatremia, secondary to acute intra￾peritoneal injection of hypertonic saline, was not
accompanied by change in brain K content.
The differences in K content, both in hypo- and
hyperosmolality among the various studies, appear
to be partly time-dependent, i.e., in hyponatremia,
K loss occurs probably within 24 hr but not within
1-2 hr; in hyperosmolality, K gain may develop
within hours, but appears to progress somewhat
with time. Our own experiments are in accord
with time-dependent losses of K in hyponatremia
and gains in hypernatremia, in which the changes
develop within hours to days.
These findings point to a mechanism whereby
cells-brain cells in this case-can change cell vol￾ume toward normal by altering solute content in
the form of K. The underlying mechanism affect￾ing this adjustment is obscure. Whether the mecha￾nism described here is a property of most cells
or an adaptation of a few cells only, such as those
of the CNS, is not yet clear. When muscle and red
cells were also'examined in our experiments, the
red cell K changed in a manner similar to that
noted for brain, but muscle cells did not gain or
lose K within the time span of our experiments.
The relation of cation concentration in total
brain water and in V4 to NaE. The excellent cor￾relation in our studies between cation concentra￾tion in brain fluid and NaE, and the character of the
regression, confirms-in a general way for brain￾the earlier relation that was developed between Na
concentration in serum and exchangeable Na plus
K in total body water (22). However, the inter￾cepts of the three regressions of these data are
very much greater than zero. Both Na and K ex￾change between brain and plasma is slow in com￾parison with most tissues (26, 50). The positive
intercept is present in the equation which involves
total brain cations and water, and the slope-inter￾cept seems unaffected by the time variables en￾compassed by these studies. This findingo consti￾tutes strong evidence that as much as 30-45% of
brain cation in the control rats is not osmotically
active. Since the Na in Vol is capable of rapid
equilibration with NaE, it seems likely that virtu￾ally all the osmotically inactive cation is in Vs.
1926 M. A. HoUiday, M. N. Kalayci, and J. Harrah

This fraction might contribute to a changing solute
content by changing its degree of dissociation
without changing total cation content of the brain.
A mechanism of this type has been cited as a pos￾sibility in the discussion of the response of Vj to
acute changes in NaE (see Discussion). If the cat￾ions of Vj were all active, then the slope of the re￾gressions of their concentrations upon NaE should
be greater than 1.0, and be approximately equal
to the ratio of cation concentration to NaE for the
controls.
The properties of the brain governing its re￾sponse to acute changes in NaE limit changes in
total brain volume to the intracellular phase, which
is approximately half that of the total brain volume.
The changes in the intracellular phase are limited
to two-thirds of those which would occur if Vj in
brain behaves according to the assumption in equa￾tion 1. The sum of these effects is to reduce
changes in brain volume in response to changing
NaE well below the changes that would occur,
should total cation and solute content in total
brain water remain-constant behind a blood-brain
barrier that allowed rapid equilibration of any
differences in osmolality. The degree of change in
brain volume in the face of an acute reduction in
NaE can be calculated from these observations.
The value of this in limiting change in brain vol￾ume is obvious. The effect can be appreciated from
the following example: an acute reduction in NaE
from 138 mEq/liter to 125 mEq/liter predicts an
increase in volume of 10% (138/125 - 1) x 100
in that phase of the brain that conforms to the as￾sumption of equation 1. Since V½ is only half that
of total brain volume (0.5) and change in Vj is
only 0.6 of that predicted from equation 1, the in￾crease in total brain volume is [100 + (0.5) (0.6)
(138/125)100] - 100% or 3%. This degree of
displacement has been shown capable of producing
symptoms (51). If swelling of this type involved
a greater per cent of brain mass, the development
of symptomatic cerebral edema secondary to acute
hyponatremia would be evident more often. The
secondary readjustment of brain volume toward
normal with more sustained change in osmolality
and associated with a change in brain K content,
provides another mechanism for protecting the
brain from extreme volume changes. It also pro￾vides a reasonable explanation for the tolerance
to sustained hypo- and hypernatremia that is ob￾served in clinical experience.
