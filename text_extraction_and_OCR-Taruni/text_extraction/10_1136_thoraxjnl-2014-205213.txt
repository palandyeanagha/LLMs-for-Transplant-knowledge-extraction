ABSTRACT
Background Person-to-person transmission of
respiratory pathogens, including Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, is a challenge facing many cystic fibrosis
(CF) centres. Viable P aeruginosa are contained in
aerosols produced during coughing, raising the
possibility of airborne transmission.
Methods Using purpose-built equipment, we measured
viable P aeruginosa in cough aerosols at 1, 2 and 4 m
from the subject (distance) and after allowing aerosols to
age for 5, 15 and 45 min in a slowly rotating drum to
minimise gravitational settling and inertial impaction
(duration). Aerosol particles were captured and sized
employing an Anderson Impactor and cultured using
conventional microbiology. Sputum was also cultured
and lung function and respiratory muscle strength
measured.
Results Nineteen patients with CF, mean age 25.8
(SD 9.2) years, chronically infected with P aeruginosa,
and 10 healthy controls, 26.5 (8.7) years, participated.
Viable P aeruginosa were detected in cough aerosols
from all patients with CF, but not from controls;
travelling 4 m in 17/18 (94%) and persisting for 45 min
in 14/18 (78%) of the CF group. Marked inter-subject
heterogeneity of P aeruginosa aerosol colony counts was
seen and correlated strongly (r=0.73–0.90) with sputum
bacterial loads. Modelling decay of viable P aeruginosa
in a clinic room suggested that at the recommended
ventilation rate of two air changes per hour almost 50
min were required for 90% to be removed after an
infected patient left the room.
Conclusions Viable P aeruginosa in cough aerosols
travel further and last longer than recognised previously,
providing additional evidence of airborne transmission
between patients with CF.
INTRODUCTION
Communicable respiratory infections are an
important cause of mortality and morbidity and
result in healthcare costs worth billions of
dollars.1 2 The person-to-person transmission of
respiratory pathogens may occur by three key
routes: contact transmission, where infectious
respiratory secretions spread by direct contact or
indirectly through a contaminated intermediate
object or person; droplet transmission, where large
infectious droplets travel directly over short dis￾tances from the respiratory tract to deposit onto
mucosal surfaces (eg, nasal and conjunctival
mucous membranes); and airborne transmission,
involving dissemination of small droplet nuclei
within the respirable size range that remain infec￾tious over time and distance and are inhaled by sus￾ceptible individuals.3 Airborne transmission may
pose a significant risk for hospital-acquired respira￾tory infection,4 with evidence that it is an import￾ant mode of acquisition for many respiratory
infections, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis
(TB) and Bordetella pertussis.5 6
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life￾limiting autosomal-recessive disorder in Caucasians
with most affected persons dying in their
third-to-fourth decade from respiratory failure
complicating chronic pulmonary infections.7
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common
pathogen in CF lung disease, and once infection is
established there is an accelerated decline in lung
function, quality of life and survival.8 9 While
many patients with CF acquire P aeruginosa sporad￾ically from the environment, molecular-typing
studies show shared strains are common in some

Key messages
What is the key question?
▸ Several studies have suggested that airborne
transmission of Pseudomonas aeruginosa
among patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is
feasible; however, it is unclear how far cough
generated aerosols travel or how long they
remain viable in the airborne phase.
What is the bottom line?
▸ Using two validated cough aerosol sampling
systems to measure the viability of P
aeruginosa in droplet nuclei we demonstrate
that patients with CF produce cough aerosols
containing viable organisms that are capable of
travelling up to 4 m and persisting in the air
for up to 45 min.
Why read on?
▸ Data presented here challenge current CF
infection control practices of separating
patients by 1–2 m to prevent cross-infection by
respiratory bacteria, suggesting a
re-examination of current infection control
practices within the CF community is needed.

CF centres, suggesting person-to-person transmission may also
be occurring.10 11 In Australia, P aeruginosa strains AUST-01
and AUST-02 are responsible for 40% of chronic infections11
and are associated with worse clinical outcomes and increased
treatment requirements.11 12 The mechanisms of cross-infection in
CF are unknown. However, despite CF centres implementing
contact and droplet transmission control measures, P aeruginosa
cross-infection continues11 13 14 and is only interrupted by imple￾menting strict patient segregation policies.15 16
It seems that a plausible mechanism of transmission between
patients is the airborne route. Indeed, patients with CF infected
with P aeruginosa produce droplet nuclei containing viable bac￾teria.17 Furthermore, studies using air sampling in CF clinical
settings have demonstrated viable P aeruginosa after physiother￾apy and in corridors outside inpatient cubicle rooms housing
patients with shared strain P aeruginosa infection.18 19 Others
have also suggested that airborne transmission is feasible, with
shared and mucoid P aeruginosa strains having a survival advan￾tage.20 21 However, methods used in previous studies were
unable to demonstrate how long viable bacteria were present in
aerosols or how far they could travel from the original source.
We therefore sought to enhance understanding of P aeruginosa
aerosol production in CF in order to (i) determine the duration
and distance of viable cough aerosols, (ii) identify the factors
influencing pathogen viability and to (iii) understand the effects
of room ventilation on controlling the duration of viable air￾borne P aeruginosa.
METHODS
Subjects
Patients with CF (n=19) aged >12 years old and chronically
infected with P aeruginosa were recruited from the Royal
Children’s Hospital (RCH) and The Prince Charles Hospital
(TPCH), Brisbane, Australia. Exclusion criteria included recent
pneumothorax, haemoptysis and pregnancy. Healthy, non￾smoking controls (n=10) were recruited from hospital staff and
their families. Further details are provided in the online supple￾mentary methods. The RCH (HREC/11/QRCH/44), The
University of Queensland (2012000615) and the Queensland
University of Technology Human Research Ethics Committees
(1100000618) approved the study and participants (or their
guardians) provided their written, informed consent.
Clinical measurements
Subjects attended two study days separated by a mean (SD) 7.5
(4.7) days (range 2–21). A sputum sample was collected from
each patient with CF on the day of testing. Cough manoeuvres
were supervised by a healthcare professional and emergency
equipment was available.
Forced expiratory volume in one-second (FEV1) and forced
vital capacity (FVC) were measured on all subjects according to
ATS/ERS guidelines.22 Respiratory muscle strength was mea￾sured by maximum inspiratory (MIP) and maximum expiratory
(MEP) mouth pressures using a Micro Medical Respiratory
Pressure Meter at TPCH. Weight, height, age, sex and clinical
status (exacerbation or clinically stable) were recorded.
Determining the distance viable cough aerosols travel
A ‘Distance Rig’ (see online supplementary methods) permitted
measurement of cough aerosols in a particle-free environment at
distances up to 4 m from the subject (see online supplementary
figure S1).23 An Andersen Impactor (28.3 L/min) captured and
measured viable cough aerosol particles,17 and a Lasair II-110
optical particle counter (OPC) measured real-time particle
concentrations and verified the absence of room air aerosol con￾tamination in the Distance Rig. Andersen Impactor and OPC
samples were collected through a common circular isokinetic
inlet.
Subjects sat with their head in the Rig breathing high￾efficiency particulate air (HEPA)-filtered air for 2 min to purge
residual room air from their lungs before coughing as frequently
and strongly as was comfortable for 5 min. The Andersen
Impactor sampled continuously during the voluntary cough
phase. Cough numbers were recorded manually. Cough aerosols
were collected at 1, 2 and 4 m (order randomised) from each
subject, who performed duplicate cough manoeuvres at each
distance.
Determining duration of aerosol viability
A Duration Rig (see online supplementary methods) comprised
a 0.4 m3 airtight stainless steel cylinder (illustrated in online
supplementary figure S3) to assess the duration of aerosol par￾ticle viability in the airborne phase. The cylinder was rotated at
1.7 rpm so that gravitational settling and inertial impaction of
particles was minimised.24 The system was flushed with
HEPA-filtered air before sample collection so that cough aero￾sols were not contaminated by room air aerosols.
Subjects were seated and fitted with a snorkel-style mouth￾piece (CareFusion Australia) connected to 10 cm of flexible
tubing. A nose clip was attached and subjects breathed filtered
air for 2 min, and then coughed as much as was comfortable for
2 min, with cough numbers recorded manually. The Rig was
isolated, and the resultant cough aerosols were aged for 5, 15 or
45 min. Suspended particles were collected with an Andersen
Impactor at the conclusion of the ageing period. Measurements
after 5 and 15 min ageing were performed in duplicate while,
for logistic reasons, only one measurement was performed after
45 min ageing.
Microbiology
Cough aerosol cultures were performed with chocolate bacitracin
(300 mg/mL) agar using previously described incubation condi￾tions and colony-forming units (CFU) count protocols.17
Quantitative (sputum) and qualitative cultures were performed
on respiratory samples using standard techniques. After presump￾tive screening, P aeruginosa isolates were confirmed by duplex
real-time (RT) PCR assays.11 P aeruginosa isolates were geno￾typed using enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-PCR
and clusters analysed alongside a previously characterised panel
of Australian shared P aeruginosa strains.11
Statistical analysis and modelling of airborne P aeruginosa
Continuous variables are reported as mean and SD, and binary
variables as frequency and percentage. Analyses were performed
using χ2 test, one-way and mixed-effects analysis of variance
with subjects as the random factor, followed by the least signifi￾cant difference procedure. Repeatability was estimated by intra￾class correlation using a two-way mixed effects analysis of
variance. CFU data were transformed as log(X+1), and their
means and 95% CI were back transformed to the original units
for ease of interpretation. We also performed a sensitivity ana￾lysis to account for the potential ‘stacking’ of organisms in the
cascade impactor (see online supplementary methods). P aerugi￾nosa decay over time was assessed using the Duration Rig data
(5, 15 and 45 min). The half-life of airborne P aeruginosa was
estimated from the slope of the decay curve. A model (see
online supplementary methods) estimated the relative effects of
ventilation and airborne biological decay on P aeruginosa

removal in different healthcare settings, including the study
site.20 25 Ventilation rates were expressed in the standard units
of air changes per hour (ACH), which describe how many times
a volume of air equal to the volume of a room enters each hour.
RESULTS
Subjects were well matched for age, sex and height, but those
with CF had lower weight, body mass index and lung function
(table 1). All subjects completed the cough manoeuvres safely.
Four patients with CF were studied during a pulmonary exacer￾bation. Within the CF group there was no significant change in
spirometry between study days (intraclass correlation coefficient
(95% CI) 0.79 (0.48 to 0.92)). Similarly, total CFUs for P aeru￾ginosa in cough aerosols, cough counts and log P aeruginosa
sputum concentration within subjects were highly repeatable
(see online supplementary table S1).
Eighteen patients with CF produced sputum and one pro￾vided a cough swab (table 1), with P aeruginosa isolated from all
and 15/19 (79%) yielding at least one mucoid isolate. Sputum
P aeruginosa concentrations ranged from 4.0×106 to
4.2×109 CFU/mL. Genotypic analysis revealed 12 strains shared
commonly within the Australian CF community11; AUST-01
(1), AUST-02 (7), AUST-06 (2), AUST-07 (1) and AUST-19 (1),
and seven unique strains. Five patients harboured two different
strains. Other organisms cultured are detailed in table 1.
P aeruginosa was cultured in cough aerosols from all patients
with CF, but not from any controls. Viable P aeruginosa was iso￾lated at 4 m from 17/18 (94%) and at all distances from 16/18
(89%) of the CF group (figure 1). Aerosolised P aeruginosa
remained viable for 45 min from 14/18 (78%) subjects in the
duration experiments (figure 2). Most viable P aeruginosa iso￾lates were cultured from particles <3.3 μm (table 2) and the
strains cultured from cough aerosols were genotypically indistin￾guishable from those isolated in respiratory samples from
the same patient. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Arxula
adeninivorans were also cultured in cough aerosols and sputum
from two patients. No other respiratory pathogens cultured in
sputum were isolated from cough aerosols. No P aeruginosa or
other microbes identified in cough aerosols were isolated from
surface swabs or blank aerosol samples taken during the studies
(see online supplementary methods).
Marked intersubject heterogeneity was seen in the total
numbers of viable P aeruginosa cultured from cough aerosols
(figure 1; see online supplementary table S2). Measured P aeru￾ginosa CFUs decreased with the distance the aerosol travelled
and with the ageing time; CFUs were significantly higher at 1 m
than 4 m, and at 5 min than 45 min (table 2). CFUs remained
significantly higher for both distance and duration when cor￾rected for the effects of stacking (see online supplementary table
S3). In both distance and duration studies, strong correlations
were seen between total, small and large fraction cough aerosols
(r=0.90–1.0). A positive correlation was found between sputum
and aerosol P aeruginosa CFUs in both distance (r=0.73–0.78)
and duration (r=0.85–0.90; see online supplementary table S4)
studies, although there was no significant correlation found
between clinical or demographic variables and cough aerosols
produced in either study. Correlations for these variables were
unchanged when measured CFUs were corrected for stacking
(see online supplementary table S5)
The influences of biological decay and room ventilation on
P aeruginosa in cough aerosols were modelled (see online supple￾mentary methods). Environmental conditions in the Duration
Rig were similar to those in the air-conditioned clinical setting.
The number of viable P aeruginosa in cough aerosol followed an
exponential decay with a half-life of 50 min (95% CI 30 to 151
min). Room ventilation removed additional viable P aeruginosa
and became the dominant mechanism of removal at ventilation
rates above the biological decay rate of the cough aerosol (ie,
approximately 0.85 ACH). Figure 3 shows the time taken to
achieve 10, 50, 90, 99 and 99.9% reductions in airborne P aeru￾ginosa following the departure of a source patient, including the
combined effects of biological decay and room ventilation. At 2
ACH, 90% of viable airborne P aeruginosa are removed in
approximately 49 min (95% CI 41 to 61 min), decreasing as ven￾tilation rate increases to approximately 24 min (95% CI 22 to 26
min) at 5 ACH and to 13 min (95% CI 12 to 13 min) at 10 ACH.

Cross-infection between patients with CF can adversely affect
health outcomes, but how this occurs and the transmission

pathways involved remain uncertain. We have shown that
patients with CF produce aerosols containing viable P aerugi￾nosa during coughing. Particles within the respirable range
persist over distance and time, providing a potential vehicle for
airborne transmission between patients. Marked intersubject
heterogeneity of aerosol production was observed, suggesting
that some patients may be ‘super-spreaders’ of P aeruginosa.
Finally, sputum P aeruginosa concentration was a strong pre￾dictor of viable cough aerosol concentrations.
Evidence of highly prevalent shared P aeruginosa strains
within CF populations suggests person-to-person transmis￾sion.10 11 26 Using air sampling equipment both in the clinical
setting, viable P aeruginosa have been demonstrated close to
patients with shared strain P aeruginosa infection.18 19 The clin￾ical significance of these findings was unclear and led us to
study the size distribution of cough aerosols, and we have previ￾ously demonstrated P aeruginosa can be present in aerosols gen￾erated by coughing.17 However, we were unable to determine
how far these aerosols travelled or the duration they remained
viable in the airborne phase. An in vitro aerosol production
system has demonstrated that artificially produced P aeruginosa
aerosols can survive up to 45 min and that survival was greater
with mucoid P aeruginosa.20 21 The present study confirms aero￾sols produced during coughing by infected patients contain
viable P aeruginosa that travel up to 4 m and stay suspended for
at least 45 min. These data add to existing evidence that air￾borne transmission is likely to play a role in patients with CF
acquiring P aeruginosa.
Our study demonstrates that droplet nuclei, generated by
coughing, and containing viable P aeruginosa, are small enough
to stay airborne for extended periods and over long distances.
They are also well within the size range to deposit within the
tracheobronchial tree following inhalation.27 Such droplets can
be efficiently disseminated to locations far from their origin by
mechanical room air ventilation systems, which often recirculate
up to 80–90% of air used for heating or cooling. The role of
room ventilation as a potentiator of airborne transmission of
microbes such as M tuberculosis, measles, SARS-coronavirus and
varicella zoster is well documented.4
Published guidelines for ventilation in hospitals suggest that 2
ACH of fresh (ie, non-recirculated) air are required for clinic
rooms and general wards, 3 ACH are recommended for proced￾ure rooms and 12 ACH are needed for isolation rooms.28 29 We
have previously published results of measuring ACH in various

clinical locations within TPCH and found that these meet or
exceed recommended levels in most cases, with an extreme
example of almost 24 ACH in an isolation room in the emer￾gency department.25 However, the data from the present study
suggest that a clinic room with the recommended two ACH may
require almost an hour after a patient harbouring P aeruginosa
leaves the room before 90% of the viable bacteria are removed
from the air (see online supplementary methods). These data
have substantial implications for CF infection control practices.
Our modelling suggests that increasing room ventilation pro￾vides some benefit; however, the time required to remove 90%
of potentially infectious aerosols still exceeds 10 min despite
substantial increases in ACH (figure 3). A new paradigm may be
needed, such as employing within CF centres advanced ventila￾tion and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) techniques to
achieve infection control, as is done for TB clinics.30 31
This study has several important limitations. The infectious
inoculum required to establish P aeruginosa infection in CF is
unknown and may vary between patients.20 Thus, it is impos￾sible to estimate to what extent viable aerosols of P aeruginosa
need to be removed to eliminate the risk of infection in suscep￾tible patients. In many CF clinical settings, contact and droplet
infection control measures have been implemented, but reduced
rates of shared P aeruginosa strain infections have been reported
only in centres employing strict cohort segregation based upon
molecular typing surveillance.15 It therefore remains uncertain
whether these simpler measures are sufficient, and if preventing
airborne transmission should also be considered when strict seg￾regation of large patient cohorts attending major CF centres is
not always feasible.14
Our study included a small number of older patients with
chronic P aeruginosa infection and moderately severe airflow
obstruction. Thus, we cannot comment on viable aerosol pro￾duction during coughing by younger or healthier patients or in
those with transient P aeruginosa infections. In addition, we
used culture media that selected for aerobic gram-negative bac￾teria and we cannot provide data on other microbes, including
Staphylococcus aureus, non-tuberculous mycobacteria or
respiratory viruses.14 32 33 Future studies using other selective
media to determine the viability of other microorganisms in
cough aerosols are now required. Due to bactericidal effects, it
is also possible that the bacitracin used in the culture media
reduced the recovery of some P aeruginosa organisms. Finally,
modelling data assume that the room air is perfectly mixed,
which is rarely the case. As such, our estimates of the time taken
to remove viable P aeruginosa from a clinic room may be overes￾timates or underestimates of real-world scenarios (see online
supplementary methods).
The present study uses bacterial infection in patients with CF
to demonstrate the potential for aerosol transmission in health￾care settings and adds to studies suggesting similar mechanisms
for M tuberculosis and for B pertussis in non-human primate
models.5 6 Our results provide further evidence, which chal￾lenges the dogma that CF bacterial pathogens within droplet
nuclei have limited survival in air. Indeed, airborne transmission
may be a more important mechanism of cross-infection within
the CF community than previously considered to be the case.
Furthermore, our data add to the controversy generated by
the current USA CF Foundation guidelines that only one
person with CF attend a CF Foundation-sponsored or CF
Centre-sponsored event34; recommendations strongly opposed
by some adults with CF.35
In summary, this study indicates that when patients with CF
harbouring P aeruginosa cough, they produce an aerosol con￾taining viable organisms capable of travelling 4 m and persisting
in the air for 45 min. These data challenge current CF infection
control guidelines that remain in place in many parts of the
world, including the separation of patients by 1–2 m to prevent
cross-infection by respiratory bacteria.13 36 Consequently,
further studies on transmission are needed and infection control
