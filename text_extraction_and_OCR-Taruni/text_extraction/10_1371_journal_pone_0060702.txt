Abstract
In renal transplantation, the unresponsiveness of patients undergoing chronic antibody mediated rejection (CAMR) to
classical treatment stress on the need for accurate biomarkers to improve its diagnosis. We aim to determine whether
microRNA expression patterns may be associated with a diagnosis of CAMR. We performed expression profiling of miRNAs
in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of kidney transplant recipients with CAMR or stable graft function. Among
257 expressed miRNAs, 10 miRNAs associated with CAMR were selected. Among them, miR-142-5p was increased in PBMC
and biopsies of patients with CAMR as well as in a rodent model of CAMR. The lack of modulation of miR-142-5p in PBMC of
patients with renal failure, suggests that its over-expression in CAMR was associated with immunological disorders rather
than renal dysfunction. A ROC curve analysis performed on independent samples showed that miR-142-5p is a potential
biomarker of CAMR allowing a very good discrimination of the patients with CAMR (AUC = 0.74; p = 0.0056). Moreover, its
expression was decreased in PHA-activated blood cells and was not modulated in PBMC from patients with acute rejection,
excluding a non-specific T cell activation expression. The absence of modulation of this miRNA in immunosuppressed
patients suggests that its expression was not influenced by treatment. Finally, the analysis of miR-142-5p predicted targets
under-expressed in CAMR PBMC in a published microarray dataset revealed an enrichment of immune-related genes.
Altogether, these data suggest that miR-142-5p could be used as a biomarker in CAMR and these finding may improve our
understanding of chronic rejection mechanisms.

Introduction
Chronic antibody-mediated rejection (CAMR) is a major cause
of kidney graft loss after one year [1]. The process leading to this
phenomenon is not yet fully understood [2,3] Furthermore,
whereas the diagnosis of CAMR is established by histological
analysis and detection of circulating Donor Specifc Antibodies
(DSA) [4], predicting its future occurrence remains elusive and
functional parameters such as creatinemia and proteinuria,
currently used in clinical practice, cannot detect CAMR early
enough to prevent irreversible graft alterations. In addition,
despite being highly specific, C4d deposits display a now well￾recognized lack of sensitivity and the presence of anti-HLA
antibodies or DSA can be associated with normal graft function
for years [1,5]. Thus, the identification of early molecular markers
of CAMR would be beneficial, in order to adjust treatment to
prevent and limit graft injury. There is currently growing interest
in microRNAs (miRNAs), which can repress the expression of
numerous genes and thereby influence large downstream networks
[6]. These small molecules are involved in various biological
mechanisms and diseases as well as in the regulation of immune
mechanisms. miRNAs have been reported in renal transplantation
as modulating gene expression in biopsies and/or blood from
recipients undergoing acute cellular rejection [7–9], fibrosis
[10,11] or operational tolerance [12]. But to date, whereas the
high stability of miRNAs favors them as potential biomarkers [13],
their detection and potential role in CAMR have not yet been
explored.
In this study, we performed profiling of miRNAs expressed in
patients with CAMR compared to patients with stable graft
function (STA). Among them, we focused on miR-142-5p, which
was over-expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e60702

and biopsies of CAMR patients, as well as in a rodent model of
CAMR, and could therefore be used as a diagnostic biomarker in
CAMR. Finally, we reported though a database analysis of
molecular target that CAMR harbored a clear fingerprint of miR￾142-5p target genes.
Materials and Methods
Patients
The study was approved by the University Hospital Ethical
Committee and the Committee for the Protection of Patients from
Biological Risks. All participating patients gave written informed
consent. Histology was classified according to pathologists and the
updated 2009 Banff classification criteria [4]. A total of 112
patients and 11 healthy volunteers were included for study and
detailed clinical data are presented in Table S1.
Blood and biopsy samples were obtained from patients with the
following status at the time of blood collection: i) Kidney recipients
with stable graft function (STA; n = 53): these patients had stable
renal function as estimated by a senior clinician, with stable
creatinemia (625% of the mean value of creatinemia in the year
preceding inclusion) (mean = 112.863.96 mmol/L (6Standard
Error)) and a daily proteinuria less than 1 g/24 h (mean = 0.166
0.19 g/24 h). miRNA expression was analyzed in 18 biopsies that
exhibited normal histological features (excepted 2 interstitial
fibrosis/tubular atrophy grade I and 3 calcineurin-inhibitor
toxicity). For the remaining patients, and in order to avoid the
inclusion of infraclinical rejection -and because biopsy would not
be performed in patients with very stable graft function for ethical
reasons-, we surveyed the graft function of these patients after at
least one year of inclusion. According to our criteria, all the STA
patients remained stable at this point; ii) Patients with chronic
antibody-mediated rejection (CAMR) (n = 40): These patients
were classified as having CAMR based on renal dysfunction and
histology. Renal dysfunction was determined by a slow and
progressive increase of creatinemia over months (mean = 247.16
25.53 mmol/L) and/or a daily proteinuria more than 1 g/24 h
(mean = 2.3060.39 g/24 h). CAMR was biopsy proven according
to the 2009 update of the Banff classification [4] that was defined
by histological evidences of chronic tissue injury (i.e. allograft
glomerulopathy (cg.0) and/or interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy
(ci+ct.0) and/or fibrous intimal thickening in arteries (cv.0))
associated with the presence of C4d and DSA (if one of the 2 last
criteria is lacking, the diagnosis is considered ‘‘suspicious’’ CAMR
(sCAMR)); iii) patients with renal failure (RF; n = 10): These
patients displayed kidney dysfunction of non-immunological cause
and had not received a transplant, immunosuppressant drugs or
dialysis (mean creatinemia = 525657.9 mmol/L); iv) Patients with
biopsy-proven acute rejection (AR) (n = 9): These patients
exhibited a rapid increase in creatinemia or proteinuria (over
days) (mean creatinemia = 333.0658.36 mmol/L and mean pro￾teinuria = 1.6960.68 g/24 h) and active acute rejection as dem￾onstrated by histology according to the 2009 update Banff
classification [4] at the time of blood sampling. v) Healthy
volunteers (HV) (n = 11): had a normal blood formula and no
infectious or other concomitant pathology for at least 6 months
before the study.
Sample preparation
Renal graft biopsies were collected using 18-G disposable
needles, immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at
280uC. Venous blood samples were collected in EDTA
vacutainers and processed for analysis within 4 hours. Peripheral
Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) were separated on a Ficoll layer
(Eurobio, Les Ulis, France). Total RNA was extracted using the
TRIzolH method (Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Heart transplant model of CAMR
Hearts from LEW.1W donors were transplanted into MHC￾mismatched LEW.1A recipients receiving a donor-specific blood
transfusion (DST) 7 and 14 days before transplantation [14,15].
The graft from the DST-treated recipients were studied at days
100 post transplantation when the grafts exhibit histological signs
of CAMR as previously reported [14].
microRNA profiling
miRNA profiling was performed using TaqMan Arrays
MicroRNA Cards pool A set v2.0 (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA, USA) with pre-amplification and following the
manufacturer’s recommendations, on an ABI Prism 7900 HT
(Applied Biosystems). miRNAs with more than half of the cycle of
quantification (Cq) values above 35 per group were eliminated.
For each sample, normalization was performed by subtraction of
the median measured Cq, resulting in the DCq value [16]. In
order to identify potential differentially expressed miRNAs,
miRNAs were ranked using p-values from non-parametric
Mann-Whitney tests, which does not require normal assumptions
and asymptotic conditions. These p-values are uncorrected for
multiple testing and thus not an absolute identification of
significant differential miRNAs, further validation is required for
each miRNA.
microRNA individual assays
Individual microRNA expression was measured with the
TaqMan miRNA assay protocol (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA, USA) using probes for miR-142-5p (assay ID: 002248), miR￾590-5p (assay ID: 001984), miR-301a (assay ID: 000528), miR-503
(assay ID: 001048), RNU6 (assay ID: 001973), miR-125b (assay
ID: 000449) and miR-374b (assay ID: 001319) starting with 10 ng
of total RNA, on an ABI Prism 7900 HT. miR-374b was chosen as
an endogenous control for PBMC samples because it was one of
the miRNA that correlated well with the median Cq of all miRNA
(r = 0,94), it had a low variance and was well expressed (mean
Cq = 18.0) in the card assays. RNU6 was chosen as an endogenous
control for other sample sources. Relative expression between a
sample and a reference was calculated according to the 22DDCq
method (PE Applied Biosystems 1997).
Gene expression microarray analysis
Gene expression data for PBMC from 12 CAMR and 12 STA
using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays (Affyme￾trix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) were obtained from the study of
Lozano et al. [17]. We then selected probes corresponding to genes
predicted as being targeted by miR-142-5p according to the
miRDB database [18] (e.g. 887 genes).
Statistical analysis
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, non-parametric
Mann–Whitney tests or Kruskal Wallis with Dunn’s ad hoc tests
were used for group comparisons with the Graph PadPrism v.4
software. Differences were defined as statistically significant when
p,0.05 (*), p,0.01 (**).

Results
CAMR is associated with a 10 miRNA blood signature
Using Taqman low density arrays (TLDA), the expression of
381 miRNAs was measured in PBMC from 9 CAMR and 10 STA
patients. 257 miRNAs were expressed with a cycle of quantifica￾tion (Cq) below 35 in at least half of the samples in each group.
Among them, we selected the 10-top ranked miRNAs according to
Mann–Whitney tests between the two groups of patients (Table 1).
Half of the miRNAs were over-expressed (miR-301a, miR-590-5p,
miR-142-5p, miR-32 and miR-503) and half were under￾expressed (miR-888, miR-576-5p, miR-548b-5p, miR-125b and
miR-194) in the blood of patients with CAMR compared to STA.
Using an unsupervised clustering analysis and a principal
component analysis (PCA) the two patient groups could be
distinguished based on the expression of these 10 miRNAs
(Figure 1).
miR-142-5p is a specific biomarker of CAMR
We focused on miR-142-5p because of its specificity for the
hematopoietic cell lineage [19,20] and its increased expression in
the blood of patients with CAMR. We first confirmed its
significant over-expression using qPCR assays on the same PBMC
samples used for profiling (p = 0.043) (Figure 2A). We also
measured the expression of four miRNAs from the signature:
miR-301a, miR-125b, miR-503 and miR-590-5p (Figure S1).
miR-590-5p was significantly up-regulated in blood from patients
with CAMR according TLDA and PCR (p = 0.049). miR-125b
and miR-503 displays down- and up-regulation, respectively,
without reaching significance (p-value.0.05) whereas no differ￾ence was observed for miR-301a. We then validated the over￾expression of miR-142-5p on an independent group of samples
composed of PBMC from 18 CAMR compared to 30 STA
patients (p = 0.0058). The ROC analysis performed on these
validation samples indicated that miR-142-5p discriminated well
CAMR and STA patients with an area under the curve (AUC) of
0.74 (CI95% = [0.59 to 0.89]; p = 0.0056) (Figure 2C). In order to
investigate the biomarker capacity of circulating miR-142-5p, this
miRNA was measured by qPCR in plasma from 10 CAMR and
10 STA. No difference was observed between the two groups of
patients (Figure S2).
To assess its specificity as a biomarker of CAMR, we measured
its expression in PBMC from patients with acute rejection (AR,
n = 9), patients with renal failure exhibiting deteriorating kidney
function for non-immunological causes without renal transplanta￾tion (RF, n = 10) and healthy volunteers (HV, n = 8) (Figure 2B).
Comparing to STA, the expression of miR-142-5p remained
significantly over-expressed in the blood of CAMR patients only
(p,0.05). No significant differential expression was observed with
HV, suggesting no relationship between miR-142-5p and the
immunosuppressive treatment (Figure 2B). ROC analyses indicat￾ed that miR-142-5p discriminated CAMR from RF patients very
well (AUC = 0.82, CI95% = [0.64 to 0.99]; p = 0.0063) and less
efficiently CAMR from AR patients (AUC = 0.72, CI95% = [0.50
to 0.94]; p = 0.064) (Figure S3). Finally, the expression of miR￾142-5p was not significantly increased in the blood of patients with
AR compared to STA (Figure 2B), and was significantly decreased
in PBMC from HV after 2 hours stimulation with phytohemag￾glutinin A (PHA; 2 mg/mL) and Interleukin 2 (IL-2; 10 ng/mL)
(p = 0.017), suggesting that its over-expression in CAMR was not
due to non-specific cell activation (Figure 2D).
Altogether, these data show that the expression of miR-142-5p
was specifically and significantly increased in the blood of patients
with CAMR but not in the blood of patients with other types of
renal dysfunction. In addition, miR-142-5p expression did not
appear to be influenced by immunosuppressive treatment and the
increase in CAMR did not seem to be the result of non-specific
activation.
miR-142-5p is increased in kidney grafts displaying
histological signs of CAMR
miR-142-5p was measured by qPCR in kidney graft biopsies
from 21 patients with CAMR and 18 patients with a well￾functioning graft and no histological lesions of CAMR (STA). An
increased expression of miR-142-5p was observed in biopsies with
CAMR compared to biopsies from STA (p = 0.0082; Figure 3A).
ROC analysis displayed a good discrimination of both population
with miR-142-5p expression (AUC = 0.75, CI95% = [0.60 to 0.91];
p = 0.0078). No correlation was found between the expression in
PBMC and in biopsy harvested at the same time in a subset of 6
patients with CAMR (Spearman r = 20.32, p = 0.53) (Figure S4).
In parallel, we analyzed the expression of miR-142-5p in a rat
model of CAMR where rat recipients of MHC-mismatched
cardiac allografts received 2 pre-graft donor-specific transfusions
(DST). 100 days after transplantation, the grafts displayed
histological signs of chronic antibody mediated rejection, with
C4d deposit, comparable to what is observed in human graft
biopsies [14]. Similar to the findings in the human biopsies, 100

days after transplantation, miR-142-5p expression was increased
in the rat grafts displaying signs of CAMR compared to syngeneic
grafts (p = 0.0079; Figure 3B).
CAMR harbored a fingerprint of miR-142-5p target genes
Using the online database miRDB (http://mirdb.org), we
identified 887 genes predicted as being potentially targeted by miR￾142-5p [18]. Among them, 595 genes were expressed in the
microarray dataset previously obtained by analyzing patients with a
similar clinical profile [17]. The over-expression of miR-142-5p in
patients with CAMR correlated with the significant down-regulation
of 41 genes (SAM q-value,10%, Fold ChangeCAMR/STA,1)
reported in Table S2. Interestingly, the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis
(IPA) performed on these 41 genes indicated a major gene network
related to ‘‘cell-mediated immune response’’ including links with the
NFkB complex, and T- and B-cell receptors (TCR and BCR)
(Figure 4A). Figure 4 (B to F) illustrates some of these genes that play
important roles in leukocyte functions: CD69, PDE4D (phosphodi￾esterase 4D, cAMP-specific), XCL1 (chemokine (C motif) ligand 1),

leukemia sequence 1) [21–24]
Discussion
More than 60% of human coding genes may be under the
control of miRNAs [25] and growing evidence indicates that they
play important roles in innate and adaptive immune functions
[26]. The dynamic expression of ubiquitous and hematopoietic￾specific miRNAs follows developmental and activation states of
immune cells [20,27,28]. Consequently, miRNA expression
deregulation may have dramatic effects. They have been shown
to be involved in human pathology and their expression has also
been reported in renal transplant patients undergoing acute
cellular rejection [7–9], fibrosis [10,11] and operational tolerance
[12].
Because of their fine-tuned modulation, miRNAs may also serve
as markers for pathological patterns involving a high number of
molecular interactions. Herein, in the search for minimally
invasive biomarkers of CAMR, we measured the expression of a
large panel of miRNAs in PBMC of patients with established
CAMR compared to patients with stable graft function. Using
non-parametric supervised analysis, we selected a short-list of 10
top-ranked miRNAs expressed in the blood of patients with
CAMR and we focused on the expression of miR-142-5p, a
specific hematopoietic cell lineage miRNA [19,20]. Its over￾expression was confirmed on the same group of patients and
validated in an independent group of patients with comparable
clinical criteria. miR-142-5p was increased in the blood and
biopsies of patients with CAMR but not in the blood of patients
with renal failure, suggesting that its over-expression is associated
with immunological disorders rather than renal dysfunction.
Interestingly, an increase expression of miR-142-5p has also been
reported in biopsies from 14 patients with interstitial fibrosis and
tubular atrophy including 5 patients exhibiting lesions of CAMR
[11]. Such increased expression of miR-142-5p was also observed
in cardiac transplant biopsies from rats displaying lesions of
chronic antibody-mediated rejection [14]. In this model, typical
histological lesions with intragraft C4d deposits and anti-donor
circulating antibodies are observed in a similar way as in humans
[14]. This increased intragraft expression of miR-142-5p in a
rodent cardiac allotransplantation model [14] suggests that this
miRNA could be used to diagnose humoral rejection in organs
other than the kidney; that needs to be confirm in further studies
in humans. Furthermore, miR-142-5p expression was decreased in
PHA-activated PBMC and was not increased in the blood of
patients with acute rejection, excluding the possibility of non￾specific T cell activation in the blood and biopsies of patients with
CAMR. The absence of modulation of this miRNA in the blood of
patients under immunosuppression (STA and AR) compared to
healthy volunteers without immunosuppressive treatment highly
suggests that its expression is not influenced by the treatment and
indicates miR-142-5p could be a blood biomarker specific for
CAMR. Finally, ROC analyses indicated that miR-142-5p
discriminated well CAMR from STA or RF patients. Of course,
only a prospective study, with large number of samples, would
establish the blood diagnostic properties of miR-142-5p compared
to clinical parameters such as creatinemia.
miR142-5p has been shown to be over-expressed in other
pathological contexts, such as cancers [29] and immunologically￾related disorders [30], small bowel inflammation [31] but also in
renal fibrosis where inflammation occurs [11,32] and in biopsies
from renal transplant patients with AR [7]. Moreover, Anglicheau
and colleagues demonstrated miR-142-5p expression in biopsies
from patients with AR is directly correlated to the infiltrate [7].
Considering that miR-142-5p is enriched in the hematopoietic cell
lineage [19,20], we speculate that this miRNA may be carried into
the graft by leukocytes, to counteract local inflammatory process.
This is in line with the fact that the allograft itself can induce
regulatory processes to prevent rejection, and that these processes
still persist when rejection occurs, likely due to the persistence of
exposure to alloantigens [33]. We speculated that the observed
discrepancy in miR-142-5p expression between AR and CAMR
patients, i.e. the absence of increased expression of miR-142-5p in
PBMC from patients with AR in opposition to CAMR whereas its
expression was previously found increased in AR biopsies [7], may
arise from the difference in kinetics of AR episodes and CAMR.
Finally, because miR-142-5p is expressed by hematopoietic cells, a
difference in PBMC would appear only if regulation mechanisms
stemming from this miRNA are involved. This possible regulatory
role of miR-142-5p in inflammatory processes is reinforced by its
inhibitory effect on growth on lung cancer cell lines [34]. We
identified 41 genes that were down-regulated in a microarray
dataset obtained in our laboratory on PBMC from patients in
similar clinical situations (CAMR and STA) [17,18] and that were
predicted as miR-142-5p targets by the miRDB. Moreover, we
reported that this miRNA is involved in different cell network
pathways and among them an immune-related network pathway
(Figure 4), showing that a clear signature of miR-142-5p target
genes is present in the blood and graft from patients with CAMR
[22]. In addition, recent findings demonstrated the over-expres￾sion of miR-142-5p in CD4+ T lymphocytes from patients with
systemic lupus erythematous reduced autoimmune activity and
IgG production whereas its inhibition in HV CD4+ T cells
induced T cell over-activation and B cell hyperstimulation [35].
Despites functional experiments are required with PBMC from
patients with CAMR, these data suggest that miR-142-5p may
play a regulatory role in the immune response, possibly involved in
controlling the leukocyte activation.
Among the 10 top-ranked miRNAs identified in the TLDA
assays, miRNAs other than miR-142-5p were modulated that have
been reported as involved in immunity and renal function. The
decreased expression of miR-125b in patients with CAMR is in
accordance with the fact that low expression of miR-125b is

required for the acquisition of effector T cell functions [36]. This
profile fits with our previously published data reporting on the
over-expression of some molecules such as TBX21, GRZB and
TLR4 in the blood and biopsies of patients with CAMR
[15,37,38]. Similarly, miR-194 was previously reported in renal
ischemia reperfusion injury [39] and fibrosis [32].
Finally, these data suggest that PBMC may be an adequate
compartment for identification of miRNAs as biomarkers in
transplantation. Our data show that miR-142-5p appears to be a
promising biomarker for CAMR diagnosis either in PBMC or
biopsies. Validation in larger cohorts of patients should establish its
diagnostic power as a biomarker for CAMR.

Table S1 Detailed clinical data. The daily proteinuria above
0.5 g/d (i.e.: 0.58 g/d) that was observed for patients STA-11 and
STA-14 was not confirmed on previous dosages and afterward
until now, thus those patients were considered highly stable.na:
