Abstract


AIMS--To evaluate whether endothelin-1 is involved in the
pathology of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). METHODS--
Plasma endothelin-1 concentrations were evaluated in 37 patients
with IPF and 27 normal controls by radioimmunoassay. In addition,
expression of endothelin-1 in lung tissue was evaluated in biopsy
specimens obtained from four patients with IPF. Three biopsy
specimens of normal lung were used as controls. Endothelin-1
immunoreactivity was detected using immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS--Elevated endothelin-1 plasma concentrations were found
in patients with IPF compared with controls and a positive
correlation was found with duration of disease. No significant
difference was observed between treated and untreated patients
with IPF. Increased endothelin-1 immunoreactivity was found in
lungs of three of four patients with IPF. Endothelin-1 positive
consisted mainly of small vessel endothelial cells. Some scattered
macrophages were also positive. CONCLUSIONS--Elevated plasma
concentrations and expression of endothelin-1 in lung tissue are
suggestive of increased production of endothelin-1 in at least a
proportion of patients with IPF. Consequently, endothelin-1 activity
could play a role in the fibrogenic process of the disease.
