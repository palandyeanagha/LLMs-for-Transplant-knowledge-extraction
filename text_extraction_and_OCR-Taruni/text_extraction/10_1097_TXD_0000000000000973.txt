ntestinal transplantations (ITx) have already been per￾formed years, but its graft survival rates after 5 years have 
plateaued at approximately 50% in the past decade.1
 One 
of the main causes of graft loss is acute cellular rejection 
(ACR),2
 characterized by gut homing of inflammatory cells 
after priming with donor-derived antigens.3,4 This results in a 
mixed inflammatory infiltrate in the lamina propria consist￾ing mostly of mononuclear cells accompanied by apoptosis of 
crypt epithelial cells and epithelial cell damage.5
Gut homing of inflammatory cells is one of the main 
features in ITx that also occurs in other intestinal diseases, 
such as intestinal graft-versus-host disease and inflammatory 
bowel disease (IBD).6,7 It requires a set of signaling molecules 
that are responsible for trafficking of leukocytes specifically 
to the intestine, including α4β7 integrin.8
 This integrin is 
highly expressed by proinflammatory gut T- and B cells and 
eosinophils.8
 Its ligand, mucosal addressin cell adhesion mol￾ecule-1, is overexpressed in endothelial cells of venules in the 
gut’s lymphoid organs and mucosa during inflammation.9
Vedolizumab, a humanized mouse anti-α4β7 monoclonal 
antibody (Entyvio; Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, Tokyo, 
Japan) shows therapeutic efficacy in IBD,10 as well as in other 
immune-mediated intestinal diseases, such as collagenous 
colitis and eosinophilic gastroenteritis.11–14 It is believed to be 
Intestinal Transplantation
Background. Graft survival rates after intestinal transplantation (ITx) are still the lowest in comparison to other solid 
organ transplants. One of the main reasons is the frequent occurrence of acute cellular rejection (ACR). Vedolizumab is 
an antibody against α4β7+ integrin involved in gut-homing of T cells which has been approved for inflammatory bowel dis￾eases (IBD). We report its off-label use to treat ACR after ITx. Methods. Following abdominal wall transplantation (AWTx) 
and ITx, clinical course was followed biochemically. Sequential small intestinal biopsies were taken preceding, during, and 
after ACR treatment with vedolizumab, following the standard therapy regime for IBD. Rejection was diagnosed histologi￾cally, and proinflammatory (α4β7+, interleukin-17+) and regulatory (FoxP3+) T cells were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. 
Results. ACR in both the ITx and AWTx resolved upon vedolizumab treatment, which was safe, evidenced by clearing 
an astrovirus and primary cytomegalovirus infection. Only a slight reduction of α4β7+ cells in the mucosa was observed, and 
α4β7+ and regulatory T cells could still move into the lamina propria upon infection. Conclusions. Vedolizumab is a safe 
treatment option for ACR after ITx but its mechanism is probably not only based on inhibition of gut-selective T-cell homing.

gut specific because of its exclusive interaction with the heter￾odimer of the aforementioned integrin, thereby blocking the 
influx of inflammatory cells into the gut.15 More recent data 
suggest that vedolizumab might not necessarily work on the 
acquired immune system but also on the innate system.16
Current treatment of ACR is focused on suppressing sys￾temic T-cell proliferation and/or depletion, but often this is 
not successful and the rejecting graft needs to be removed.17
Thus, alternative pharmacological approaches are urgently 
needed to treat ACR after ITx and, considering its mechanism 
of action, vedolizumab could be a promising option.
Here, we describe the intraintestinal cellular dynamics of a 
combined ITx and abdominal wall transplantation (AWTx) 
patient with ACR of both grafts who did not respond to regu￾lar immunosuppressive therapy and was subsequently safely 
and successfully treated with vedolizumab.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethical Approval
Treatment and follow-up studies were fully understood 
and accepted by the patient and approved by the Ethical 
Committee of the University Medical Center Groningen 
(study number M14.163082).
Immunohistochemistry
Hematoxylin and eosin slides were prepared according 
to a standard protocol to diagnose graft rejection. Paraffin￾embedded tissue sections of the intestinal biopsies gathered 
by endoscopy were cut (4 µm) from routine diagnostic blocks, 
placed on Starfrost slides (3054-1, Klinipath, VWR, Breda, The 
Netherlands), dried, deparaffinized in xylene, and rehydrated in 
alcohol. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 0.3% H2
O2
in phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) for 30 minutes. The slides 
were then blocked for 30 minutes with 1% bovine serum albu￾min (BSA)/PBS before being incubated for 1 hour at room tem￾perature with a primary antibody against FoxP3 (1:100 Abcam 
[22510], Cambridge, UK) and interleukin (IL)-17 (1:200 R&D 
Systems [AF-317-NA], Minneapolis, MN, USA). The secondary 
and tertiary steps were performed with horseradish peroxidase￾labeled antibodies (1:50, Dako, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA; 
rabbit antimouse and goat antirabbit, respectively) in 1% BSA/
PBS supplemented with 1% human serum, incubated for 30 
minutes. Binding was detected by 3,3-diaminobenzidine and 
counterstained with hematoxylin.
The Act-1 (anti-α4β7) antibody was used (1:50 Takeda 
Pharma A/S, Taastrup, Denmark) for staining of vedolizumab￾targeted cells. Frozen intestinal tissue embedded in Tissue-Tek 
O.C.T. Compound (Sakura Finetek Europe, Alphen aan den 
Rijn, the Netherlands) was cut, dried, and fixed with 4% par￾aformaldehyde for 10 minutes. Endogenous peroxidase was 
blocked with 0.075% H2
O2
 in PBS for 30 minutes, followed 
by 30 minutes blocking in 1% PBS/BSA, 1-hour incubation 
with the primary antibody, followed by the secondary (rabbit 
antimouse peroxidase-labeled) and tertiary (goat antirabbit 
peroxidase-labeled) antibodies (1:50, Dako, Agilent) for 30 
minutes each. Binding was detected by 3-amino-9-ethylcarba￾zole and counterstained with hematoxylin.
Definitions
ACR is defined as the presence of ≥6 apoptotic bodies per 
10 consecutive crypts (ABC) accompanied by crypt epithelial 
cell destruction and the presence of inflammatory cells in the 
lamina propria.5
 Areas where there are higher numbers of cells 
of interest and ABC selected at lower magnification are here￾with referred to as hotspots. All biopsies with different types 
of staining were scanned first for hotspots. If none were found, 
a random area was chosen (at least 5 per slide). A high-power 
field is defined at ×40 magnification, with an area of 0.24mm2
.
Cell Counting
Rejection was identified for diagnostic purposes and reported 
here in that manner, according to the guidelines for each organ.5,18
Cell counting was performed independently by a researcher and 
a pathologist, and a consensus was reached when discrepancies 
emerged. All stained cells were counted individually per high￾power field. The presence of cytoplasmic staining using the anti￾bodies directed against α4β7, IL-17, and FoxP3 was considered 
positive for the antibody. The average of all available fields was 
taken for analyses. Primary data were analyzed using Microsoft 
Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, Washington, USA), GraphPad 
Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA), and SPSS 
25 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Measurements were then grouped 
into clinically relevant periods and presented as the median and 
range up to 1 year post transplant.
CASE DESCRIPTION AND RESULTS
A 19-year-old female underwent a subtotal colectomy 
because of ulcerative colitis. Her diagnosis was changed to 
Crohn’s disease after she presented ulcerations in her oesoph￾agus, stomach, and small bowel, complicated by severe perfo￾rations. This led to small bowel resection and consequently an 
ultrashort bowel syndrome with loss of abdominal domain. 
She had a distal duodenogastrostomy, drained by a percuta￾neous gastrostomy.19 After 10 months on home total paren￾teral nutrition, the patient was screened for ITx because of 
liver function impairment and jaundice. During the following 
2 years, she suffered from several episodes of line infections, 
malnourishment, and poor quality of life and was put on the 
waiting list for a combined ITx with AWTx.
IT and AWTx
In March 2015, the patient successfully underwent ITx in 
combination with full-thickness AWTx (the surgical descrip￾tion has been published elsewhere20). Crossmatch was nega￾tive. A list of clinically relevant episodes, immunosuppression, 
and trough levels is given in Table 1.
The induction of immunosuppression consisted of meth￾ylprednisolone (500mg) and antithymocyte globulin (ATG; 
9mg/kg). The maintenance plan initially followed a standard 
scheme consisting of tacrolimus (8mg/d, trough levels 13–
17mg/L), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF; 2g/d, trough levels 
2–4mg/L), and prednisolone. The latter drug is administered 
in the following manner: 2mg/kg/d intravenous (IV) for days 
1–3 post ITx; 1mg/kg/d IV or oral for days 4–8; 0.3mg/kg/d 
oral for days 9–30; 0.2mg/kg/d oral for months 2–3; and 
0.1mg/kg/d oral for months 4–6. Standard treatment of ACR 
is performed in the department in a stepwise manner: first by 
increasing tacrolimus dosage; second by giving a 3-day boost 
of IV methylprednisolone; third by adding a T-cell depleting 
agent such as ATG.
On day 6 post transplantation, the ileum biopsy revealed 
signs of grade 1 ACR, treated temporarily with an increased

dose of tacrolimus to reach trough levels between 15–20 
µg/L. On day 14, despite adequate trough levels of tacroli￾mus (20.6 µg/L), ACR returned together with fever and pan￾cytopenia, the latter requiring cessation of MMF treatment. 
Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was administered on 
day 20 (30 million units), resulting in an increase in blood 
leukocyte count. The transplanted abdominal wall showed 
no signs of rejection until day 21 (grade 1). ACR persisted 
and treatment with methylprednisolone (3 d 1000 mg IV) 
suppressed this for 11 days. ACR (grade 2) returned on day 
81. Having considered the previous development of pan￾cytopenia under MMF treatment and limited alternative 
options, we decided to use vedolizumab because of her his￾tory of IBD and its safe and potentially promising mecha￾nism of action.
We treated the patient with 300-mg vedolizumab on weeks 
0, 2, and 6 (induction), and every 8 weeks thereafter (main￾tenance, 8 infusions during the period of this study), with 
biopsy controls. Immunosuppression with tacrolimus con￾tinued alongside this treatment with trough levels between 
17.8–24.5 µg/L (normal–high) during induction and 6.5–19.5 
µg/L (normal) during maintenance.
Immunosuppression with Vedolizumab
Signs of rejection in the ITx and AWTx grafts disappeared 
during the induction period, and her clinical status steadily 
improved during the period of this study (1-y follow-up). This 
was accompanied by a slight reduction of vedolizumab-targeted 
cells in the intestinal graft and an increase in IL-17+
 Th17 cells 
(Figure 1). Treatment was safe, since the patient could clear an 
astrovirus infection on day 259 post ITx, diagnosed by RNA 
analysis from fecal samples. Remarkably, also a primary cyto￾megalovirus (CMV) infection (between d 316 and 337 post ITx, 
IgM and DNA positive in polymerase chain reaction) during val￾ganciclovir prophylaxis cleared without any clinical symptoms. 
This was accompanied by an increase of α4β7+
 (proinflamma￾tory) and FoxP3+
 (regulatory T cells, Treg) cells in the graft as 
well (Figure 1). Maintenance therapy continued with tacrolimus 
(trough levels 5–7 µg/L) and prednisone (10mg/d). Both cleared 
infectious episodes occurred during vedolizumab treatment 
(between the sixth and seventh infusions of vedolizumab).

with vedolizumab. Astrovirus and primary CMV infections 
were uneventfully cleared, and there were no episodes of 
ACR after the therapy started. This case allowed us to study 
immune cell dynamics surrounding episodes of infection and 
rejection of an intestinal and abdominal wall graft treated 
with an integrin-specific antibody.
This patient had a background of Crohn’s disease, but 
there were no signs of recurrent disease post-transplantation. 
Rejection could not be controlled by the standard treat￾ment options with tacrolimus, MMF, or methylprednisolone. 
Considering her past experience with infliximab and the pro￾posed mechanism of action of vedolizumab, it was chosen as 
the most promising treatment option. ACR disappeared dur￾ing induction period alongside a decrease of the drug’s target 
cells, which then reappeared under maintenance. This sug￾gests that the therapeutic effect of this drug is not solely based 
on blocking the entry of α4β7+
 integrin cells in the intestinal 
mucosa, as was proposed by others.16,21
The aforementioned dynamics of α4β7+
 cells in the graft 
may indicate that autoreactive leukocytes with increased 
α4β7+
 on their surface that initiated the rejection episode were 
blocked or downregulated during induction.22 Studies in a 
large IBD population have shown that there are increased lev￾els of expression of proinflammatory markers such as that of 
α4 subunit and regulatory molecules for Th17 cells.23 Patients 
with IBD also have impaired functions of Th17 helper cells, 
which maintain homeostasis between the intestinal mucosa 
and the microbiota.16,23 Interestingly, our study showed an 
increase in the presence of this cell type during induction 
therapy with vedolizumab, alongside the improvement of 
her clinical picture. On the other hand, during the infection 
periods there are α4β7+
 cells migrating to the gut and in the 
maintenance phase an influx of α4β7+
 was observed that was 
not accompanied with rejection. An explanation could be that 
α4β7 upregulation on leukocytes is less prominent in these 
situations and that these α4β7+
 cells use alternative routes 
for migration into the gut. Furthermore, in IBD patients, it 
has been shown that vedolizumab also changes the transcrip￾tional signatures of the innate immune system.16 Additionally, 
a Crohn’s disease patient with a grade 3 ACR episode and 
an infliximab-resistant, refractory rejection was also given 
vedolizumab in another center. This patient’s inflamma￾tory signs (ACR, inflammatory stenosis) also resolved after 
induction therapy, and in this patient maintenance ther￾apy was not needed (Dr A. Pascher, 2015, written personal 
communication).
Other cases of ITx ACR treated with vedolizumab were 
presented at the XV Congress of the Intestinal Rehabilitation 
and Transplantation Association (CIRTA).24,25 Four pediat￾ric patients with a background of microvillus inclusion dis￾ease were transplanted and suffered from ACR. Induction 
with vedolizumab was successful, but maintenance treat￾ment was not effective (Norsa et al, poster presentation, 
CIRTA, 2017).25 The underlying pathophysiology of graft 
rejection may differ in patients with such disease, as they do 
not suffer from an impaired immune response that is typical 
for IBD patients.
Our patient suffered from viral infections during this treat￾ment, which resolved without complications, indicating that 
this drug is safe. Other recent evidence supports this notion.26
No rejection

cells (Act-1+, IL-17+) and Treg (FoxP3+) in the intestinal graft in relationship with the most clinically relevant events during the first year post 
transplantation. Results are herewith presented in periods as the median and range of positive cells per HPF (see Materials and Methods section 
for more information). The prevedolizumab era is represented per month, and the vedolizumab treatment period consists of induction period (3 
infusions within 2 mo), maintenance without comorbidities (4 mo), primary astrovirus (1 biopsy), and CMV infections (20 d), and the last biopsy 
before the end of the first year. More details within each period can be found in Table 1. ACR, acute cellular rejection; CMV, cytomegalovirus

CMV primarily affects the endothelial cells of the intestine.27
The union between the integrin α4β7 and the endothelial 
cell-expressed receptor mucosal addressin cell adhesion mol￾ecule-1 is blocked with vedolizumab. The asymptomatic 
resolution of this primary CMV infection could therefore be 
associated with a milder, yet effective inflammatory response 
in the vessel walls.16
One could speculate that the influx of protective Treg 
should be compromised by this treatment. However, FoxP3+
Treg were still present in the graft during vedolizumab treat￾ment and infiltrated the graft during infections (Figure 1). 
This may support other studies that show α4β7 levels are 
relatively low in a specific subset of FoxP3+ Treg,22 and thus 
may depend on different gut-homing mechanisms.16
Notably, the transplanted abdominal wall of this patient 
was not a sentinel marker for rejection of the intestinal 
graft, as observed by others.28 Rejection of the skin started 
2 weeks after it was detected in the intestine and resolved 
after 3 infusions of vedolizumab, later than the intestinal 
graft. Although vedolizumab is proposed to be gut selective, 
we also observed the resolution of rejection on the trans￾planted abdominal wall. Transplanted skin has an inflam￾matory microenvironment that might differ from normal 
skin immune reactions. Unfortunately, technical limitations 
prevented us from analyzing dynamics of vedolizumab tar￾get cells in the transplanted abdominal wall as only for￾malin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue was available, while 
the currently available antibody against α4β7 only works 
on frozen tissue. There is clinical evidence in psoriasis and 
graft-versus-host disease of the skin that points to an indirect 
systemic effect of vedolizumab that might help explain the 
effects observed on the AWTx.29,30
Although these hypotheses cannot be substantiated within 
this case report, new studies in vedolizumab-treated patients 
should be focused on α4β7+
 upregulation in different cell 
activation processes (alloreactivity, autoimmunity, infection), 
the use of alternative cell migration routes in these situations 
and alternative mechanisms of action as suggested in IBD 
patients.23 Furthermore, vedolizumab should be studied in 
more patients undergoing ITx without the history of inflam￾matory disease.25,31
In conclusion, we present an observational study of a 
unique case with successful treatment of ACR of an intestinal 
and abdominal wall graft which was safe and did not hamper 
the clearance of an astrovirus and primary CMV infections. 
Our analyses on the dynamics vedolizumab targets and Treg 
suggest that α4β7+
 cells do play a role in ACR but that cell 
migration to the gut can also use alternative routes and/or 
that vedolizumab has additional mechanisms of action. This 
unique case taught us that vedolizumab can be considered as 
safe treatment option for treating ACR in patients who failed 
conventional treatment thereby adding a treatment option 
improving graft survival in ITx.
