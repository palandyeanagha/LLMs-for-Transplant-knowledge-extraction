Abstract. Acute hepatitis B (AHB) is a self-limiting condition in more than 95% of cases. Treatment 
is however recommended in patients with severe AHB (<1% of cases), aiming to prevent liver 
failure and death. Various nucleos(t)ide analogues (NA) have been found to be effective in severe 
AHB, although NA-resistant strains causing AHB have been also recently reported. The use of 
tenofovir in severe AHB has only been described in 3 cases (1 adult and 1 infant with HBV mono￾infection, 1 adult with HBV/HIV co-infection). We hereby report a 47-year-old treatment-naïve 
male, who developed severe AHB and was initially treated with lamivudine (LMV). Initial rapid 
biochemical response was followed by biochemical breakthrough after 9 days, suggesting LMV 
resistance. Rescue therapy with ‘add-on’ tenofovir brought about a sustained improvement in 
biochemical, serological and virological markers until HBsAg was lost after 4 months. Thus, this is 
the second adult HBV mono-infected patient, who responded successfully to tenofovir in severe 
AHB.
Introduction. Acute hepatitis B (AHB) is a self￾limiting condition in more than 95% of cases; however, 
in less than 1% of cases, it may progress to liver failure 
necessitating liver transplantation. Treatment for AHB 
is usually not required, however international bodies 
recommend to commence treatment in patients with 
fulminant or severe acute hepatitis B1,2
- the latter 
defined by any two of the following three criteria: 
serum bilirubin equal to or more than 10mg/dL, INR 
equal to or more than 1.6 and hepatic encephalopathy3
-
aiming at preventing progression to liver failure. As 
Interferon therapy is contraindicated in this scenario 
due to the risk of worsening hepatitis and frequent side 
effects,2
both AASLD and EASL have recommended 
the use of a nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) in severe 
AHB.2 To date, however, there is still no evidence 
which NA is best in this setting, as randomized 
controlled trials comparing the efficacy of different 
NAs are lacking, owing to the difficulty in enrolling 
such non-frequent patients in two arms and being 
adequately numerous. 
Despite lamivudine (LMV) being the most widely 
used antiviral in severe AHB with encouraging results,4
we have seen recently the emergence of LMV resistant 
strains in treatment-naïve patients causing primary 
drug resistance and thus requiring newer antivirals such 

Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis 2013; 5: Open Journal System
as entecavir for rescue therapy.5 Documented use of 
these newer antivirals, especially tenofovir, in severe 
AHB, as first line or rescue therapy has been as yet 
very limited. To date, there have been only 3 published 
cases of fulminant or severe AHB treated with 
tenofovir.6-8 These include two adult patients (one with 
HBV mono-infection6
and one with HBV/HIV co￾infection7
) and one 4-month old HBV mono-infected 
infant.8 The two mono-infected patients cleared the 
virus with tenofovir and survived, while the HBV/HIV 
co-infected patient succumbed to the disease. We 
hereby report the second case in the English literature, 
where tenofovir was successfully used in an adult non￾HIV patient with severe AHB, who developed clinical 
LMV failure after few days of LMV monotherapy. 
Case Report. A 47-year-old male, known to suffer 
from asthma, presented to the accident and emergency 
department with a nine day history of jaundice, 
epigastric pain, nausea, lethargy and decreased 
appetite. This was accompanied by a three day history 
of low grade fever, dark urine and pale stools. His 
alcohol intake ranged between 8 -10 units per week and 
he did not report taking any new medications or any 
recent traveling. Although revealing no illicit 
intravenous drug use, he frequently smoked marijuana
recreationally, as well as a packet of cigarettes daily. 
He was in a stable ten-year relationship with a male 
partner and both of them had checked their viral status 
one month earlier, all of which, including hepatitis B, 
C and HIV, were negative. His past medical history 
was unremarkable.
On examination, the patient had a Glasgow coma 
scale of 15 and was oriented to time, place and person. 
He was jaundiced, had a temperature of 37.5oC and 
was haemodynamically stable. There were no stigmata 
of chronic liver disease and a hepatic flap could not be 
elicited. He was tender in the right upper quadrant and 
had a palpable hepatomegaly four centimetres below 
the right costal margin. No associated splenomegaly or 
ascites were present. His cardiorespiratory system was 
normal.
Laboratory investigations showed a white cell count 
7.6 x 109
/L, haemoglobin 15.3g/dL, platelet count 100 
x 109
/L, normal renal function (estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR) 81mls/min/1.72m2
), normal 
glucose and amylase. Liver function tests revealed a 
hepatitic picture with a total bilirubin 10.8mg/dL 
(direct bilirubin 10.5mg/dL), alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP) 367 U/l, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 3258 
U/l, gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) 1072 U/l and 
an abnormal synthetic function with an International 
normalized ratio (INR) of 1.63 and albumin 33.3g/L. 
Serologic tests were positive for hepatitis B surface 
antigen (HBsAg), IgM antibodies to hepatitis B core 
antigen (anti-HBc) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). 
Antibodies to hepatitis B e antigen (anti-HBe) were 
absent. HBV DNA was detected in the serum using 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Tests for IgM 
antibodies to hepatitis A virus, hepatitis C virus, human 
immunodeficiency virus and cytomegalovirus were all 
negative. The source of this acute HBV infection could 
not be confirmed. An ultrasound of the abdomen 
showed two liver haemangiomas, one measuring 1.0 x 
1.3cm in the left lobe and the other measuring 1.4 x 
1.4cm in the right lobe. No gallbladder stones were 
present and the biliary tree was of normal caliber. 
Initially, he was started on N-acetyl cysteine at a 
dose of 100mg/kg in 1L 5% dextrose every 16 hours. 
On day 2, after repeating and confirming the total and 
direct bilirubin to be ≥10mg/dL and INR ≥1.6, in 
accordance with having fulfilled two out of the three 
criteria for the diagnosis of severe AHB (clinical 
encephalopathy was not present), antiviral therapy with 
lamivudine 100mg daily was then added. A dramatic 
improvement in liver enzymes and INR was observed, 
however this was only sustained for the first 9 days 
(total bilirubin decreased to 5.5mg/dL, ALT 1237U/l 
and INR 1.15) (Figure 1). On day 10, deterioration in 
the biochemical parameters was once again noted, and 
on day 14, since the deterioration persisted (total 
bilirubin increased to 13.9mg/dL, ALT 2896U/l and 
INR 1.38), tenofovir 245mg daily was commenced. 
This brought about a gradual improvement in liver 
enzymes and synthetic function. Total normalization of 
the liver biochemical parameters was achieved after 3 
months (Figure 1). At this point, lamivudine was 
decreased to 100mg every alternate day. After a further 
one month, the patient had managed to achieve anti￾HBs seroconversion. At this point, lamivudine was 
therefore stopped and tenofovir was eventually tailed 
down over another two months. Renal function and 
serum phosphate levels remained intact throughout this 
period (eGFR 87mls/min/1.72m2
, no proteinuria on 
urinalysis and serum phosphate 1.22mmol/l). PCR for 
HBV DNA was undetectable at this stage and anti￾HBsAg antibody titres were positive at 212mIU/ml.
Discussion. The transplant-free survival rates in 
fulminant or severe AHB with or without antiviral 
therapy have been studied by various groups.4,9,10 In a 
pooled analysis by Tillmann et al., the transplant-free 
survival rate in untreated severe AHB was 45.7%, 
whilst that in LMV-treated severe AHB patients was 
78.2%.11 The rationale of treating patients with 
fulminant or severe AHB is thus justified, with NAs 
being the preferred option,1,2 aiming at reducing 
mortality. Moreover, in patients requiring liver 
transplantation, treating severe AHB offers a higher 
chance of HBV DNA suppression, thereby reducing

the risk of reinfection in the graft.11 Our patient 
fulfilled two out of the three diagnostic criteria of 
severe AHB (bilirubin 10.8mg/dL, INR 1.63) and was 
thus deemed a candidate for treatment, particularly in 
our centre where liver transplantation facilities are 
lacking.
LMV has been the most widely studied antiviral in 
severe AHB. It has been shown to be safe and 
effective,4 with a rapid onset of action11 and able to 
decrease HBV DNA load, preventing progression to 
liver failure12 and reducing mortality.11 This has been 
clearly demonstrated when LMV was started earlier on, 
prior to the development of overt encephalopathy, 
highlighting the importance of significant prolonged 
prothrombin time as being a crucial marker of impaired 
liver function.11 However, too-early administration of 
lamivudine has also been found to reduce the rates of 
HBsAg and HBeAg seroconversion.13 The low genetic 
barrier and development of resistance of LMV is 
perhaps its major shortcoming, which has thoroughly 
been described in chronic hepatitis B, especially when 
given as monotherapy.14 On the contrary, in AHB, 
where the treatment duration is anticipated to be short, 
LMV resistance seldom occurs, especially during the 
first 36 weeks of therapy, as described in a large series 
by Atkins et al..15 In fact, AASLD recommend LMV or 
telbivudine monotherapy as first line therapy in severe 
AHB infection when the anticipated duration of 
treatment is short.2
Recently, however, LMV-resistant strains in AHB 
have started to emerge as well, even in treatment-naïve 
patients, necessitating the need to switch therapy to a 
newer NA with a higher barrier to resistance. With 
such resistant strains becoming more prevalent, the 
importance of identifying the genotype and its 
resistance pattern prior to commencing therapy has 
become more pertinent and is therefore encouraged. 
The first two published cases of LMV-resistant strains 
in severe AHB by a German group in 2008, reported 
primary LMV resistance and were salvaged 
successfully by switching to entacavir or to ‘add-on’ 
adefovir respectively.5
Since then, both Japan and 
China have reported cases of LMV-resistant strains in 
AHB.16-18 In the Japanese study, the incidence of these 
strains was 4.44% (2/45).16The two cases reported, one 
with subgenotype C2 and the other with subgenotype 
A2, developed a self-limiting hepatitis and a severe 
AHB respectively, who had a favorable outcome with 
LMV and steroids.16 The incidence of LMV-resistant 
strains in the Chinese series was however reported as 
7% (14/201), all of whom were NA-untreated patients 
with AHB, with the predominant genotype being 
genotype C (10/14).17 They reported eleven cases of 
LMV-resistant strains, with the most frequent 

Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis 2013; 5: Open Journal System
mutations being rtM204I and/or rtM204V, two cases of 
adefovir-resistant strains and one case of entacavir￾resistant strain.17 In a further Chinese study published 
last year, where the incidence of LMV-resistant strains 
was reported as 4.7% (11/234) (nine with self-limiting 
hepatitis and two with severe AHB), genotype C was 
once again the predominant genotype (8/11).18 This 
Chinese study was the first, however, to demonstrate 
that such LMV-resistant strains may progress into a 
chronic infection following an acute episode.18 This 
occurred in one patient with LMV-resistant AHB 
genotype C, who developed chronic occult HBV 
infection.18 Identification of more mutant strains to 
adefovir, lamivudine and entecavir were reported this 
year by Baxa et al. in three symptomatic AHB 
patients,19 while Morando et al. detected LMV and 
telbivudine relevant mutations in a patient with severe 
AHB genotype C.6 To date, as yet, there are no 
reported tenofovir-resistant viral mutants causing 
AHB.
The use of NAs other than LMV in AHB, such as 
adefovir, entecavir or tenofovir as first line 
monotherapy, rescue ‘add on’ therapy or combined 
therapy with LMV, is very limited. The few reported 
cases to date that have used adefovir or entacavir 
include primary monotherapy use of entacavir in a case 
series of six German patients20 and two Italian 
patients,21,22 and rescue therapy with adefovir and 
entacavir in the two German cases mentioned above.5
All these cases had favorable outcomes. Tenofovir use 
in severe AHB has been only reported in three cases; 
two adult patients (one with HBV mono-infection6
and 
another with HBV/HIV co-infection7
) and one HBV 
mono-infected 4-month old infant.8 The patient with 
co-infection succumbed to the disease despite therapy 
but the other two cases achieved full viral suppression 
and seroconversion and survived without requiring 
transplantation. Baxa et al. reported the use of 
tenofovir in four American patients with symptomatic, 
but not severe, AHB, with resolution of the infection 
occurring in just two.19 The outcome of the other two 
were unfortunately not reported.19 Although tenofovir 
is a highly effective antiviral with a high barrier to 
resistance, caution needs to be exercised in its use due 
to the risk, albeit low, of nephrotoxicity and bone 
toxicity. Madeddu et al. reported a 2.5% prevalence of 
nephrotoxicity in HIV patients receiving combination 
antiretroviral therapy including tenofovir,23 while De
Socio et al. reported a case of tenofovir-induced 
hypophosphatemic osteomalacia, which resolved on 
discontinuation of the drug.24
Our case is the second documented case where 
tenofovir was successfully used in a non-HIV adult 
treatment-naïve patient with severe AHB. Initial rapid 
biochemical improvement suggested satisfactory LMV 
response; however the biochemical breakthrough that 
occurred on day 9 of treatment suggested the 
development of LMV resistance. Lack of genomic 
sequence analysis facilities in our institution precluded 
us from identifying the genotype of this strain and the 
mutation that occurred in the HBV polymerase gene. It 
is difficult therefore to establish whether there were 
pre-existing mutant HBV strains, which emerged under 
LMV pressure or whether this was a de novo
generation of a mutant quasispecies after LMV 
exposure. It thus seemed reasonable at this stage to use 
one of the most potent NAs with the highest barrier to 
resistance as a rescue therapy, as lack of identification 
of the underlying genetic mutation/s precluded us from 
understanding whether this was a LMV-only resistant 
virus or a multi-drug resistant virus. Our choice to use 
tenofovir, instead of entecavir, was based on the fact 
that both the efficacy and the genetic barrier to
entecavir are significantly reduced in the presence of 
LMV-resistant mutations.25,26 Moreover, entecavir is 
associated with increased drug resistance in LMV￾refractory chronic hepatitis B patients.27 On the 
contrary, tenofovir has been shown to be highly 
effective against LMV-resistant HBV virus,28,29 and as 
yet there are no reports of tenofovir resistance, and thus 
this seemed to be the best option in our patient. This 
proved to be successful by suppressing HBV DNA and 
bringing about HBsAg loss after four months with later 
seroconversion to anti-HBs, without the development 
of any renal complications. In keeping with the 
AASLD guidelines,2 where treatment can be stopped 
once HBsAg clearance has been achieved, our group 
tailed down tenofovir gradually over the following few 
weeks.
In conclusion, we have hereby reported the second 
case of a treatment-naïve adult non-HIV patient with 
severe AHB, who responded successfully to tenofovir 
following clinical failure to LMV monotherapy, 
suggesting LMV resistance. Tenofovir seems safe and 
effective in this setting and we thus concur with 
Morando et al. that tenofovir may be a suitable option 
for the treatment of severe AHB. The importance of 
identifying the viral genotype and its resistance pattern 
at baseline prior to commencing treatment in order to 
guide the appropriate choice of antiviral should be 
emphasized.
