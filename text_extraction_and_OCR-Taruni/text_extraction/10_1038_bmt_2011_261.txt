This prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the efficacy of palifermin to reduce the
incidence of severe (grade 3 -- 4) acute GVHD after myeloablation and allo-SCT. Adults who received allo-SCT for hematologic
malignancies received placebo or palifermin 60 mg/kg daily on three consecutive days before conditioning and a single dose
of 180 mg/kg after conditioning, but often 1 or 2 days before allo-SCT. Subjects received MTX (plus CYA or tacrolimus) on days
1, 3, 6 and 11. Acute GVHD was evaluated once weekly and oral mucositis was evaluated daily. Subjects were randomly
assigned to placebo (n ¼ 78) or palifermin (n ¼ 77). Conditioning included TBI in approximately half of the subjects (48%
placebo, 51% palifermin). The primary efficacy end point, subject incidence of grade 3 -- 4 acute GVHD, was similar between
treatment groups (17% placebo, 16% palifermin). Grade 3 -- 4 oral mucositis (73% placebo, 81% palifermin) and other secondary
efficacy end points were similar between treatment groups. The most commonly reported treatment-related adverse events
were skin/s.c. events such as rash, pruritus, and erythema. This exploratory study of acute GVHD after myeloablation and allo￾SCT did not provide evidence of a treatment effect with this dosing regimen of palifermin.

INTRODUCTION
Allo-SCT is the treatment of choice for a variety of hematological
malignancies.1 Although the use of reduced intensity conditioning
regimens has increased, myeloablative regimens continue to be a
standard of care for young patients. About 35 -- 50% of allo-SCT
recipients develop grade 2 -- 4 acute GVHD, with a higher incidence
after unrelated donor transplants and mismatched donor trans￾plants compared with HLA-identical sibling donor transplants.2
Oral mucositis with ulceration (World Health Organization (WHO)
grade 2 -- 4) occurs in approximately 75% of patients receiving
myeloablative regimens.3 Prophylaxis with a MTX- and calcineurin
inhibitor-based regimen is effective in reducing GVHD,4 but
worsens mucositis in many patients.5
Keratinocyte growth factor appears to modulate the endogen￾ous response to epithelial injury. In animal studies, recombinant
human Keratinocyte growth factor (palifermin) reduced GVHD and
inhibited rejection of allo-SCT.6 - 8 Palifermin was shown to
decrease the incidence and duration of severe oral mucositis in
patients who received TBI-based conditioning therapy and
autologous SCT.9 The approved dose of palifermin for reduction
of severe oral mucositis is 60 mg/kg daily by i.v. bolus injections for
3 days before and 3 days after an myeloablative regimen and SCT.
Prior studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of palifermin to
reduce GVHD either with this dose, or with a collapsed 180 mg/kg
dose 1 day before the start of the myeloablative regimen and
60 mg/kg daily for at least 3 days after the end of the
myeloablative regimen.10 - 13 Because MTX is dosed 1, 3, 6 and
11 days after allo-SCT and the interaction between palifermin and
MTX was not known, this study used a regimen of three doses
(60 mg/kg daily) prior to the start of myeloablative and one
collapsed dose (180 mg/kg) at the end of the myeloablative
regimen, often prior to allo-SCT.
The primary aim of this randomized, double-blind, placebo￾controlled study was to explore the potential of palifermin to
reduce the incidence of severe (grade 3 -- 4) acute GVHD in
patients undergoing allo-SCT from either a related donor or an
HLA-matched, unrelated donor.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects
Adults of at least 18 years of age were eligible for the study if they had a
hematologic malignancy (including myelodysplastic syndromes) and were
scheduled to receive allogeneic marrow or PBPC transplantation after one
out of six myeloablative conditioning regimens: CY plus TBI±etoposide,
TBI plus etoposide, melphalan plus TBI 41100 cGy, BU plus CY, BU plus
melphalan (fully ablative doses) or fludarabine plus melphalan (fully
ablative doses). Subjects were required to have Karnofsky Performance
Status X70% and to have either a related donor or an HLA-matched
unrelated donor identical at 6/6 HLA-A, -B and -DRB1 loci. For unrelated
donors, molecular typing of class I and class II was mandatory.
Key exclusion criteria included the following: other malignancies, prior
BM or PBPC transplantation, previous use of palifermin, active infection or
oral mucositis, congestive heart failure (NYHA class III or IV), use of a T-cell
depleted graft for GVHD prophylaxis, inadequate renal, liver or pulmonary
function, pregnancy or breast feeding, refusal to use adequate contra￾ception during the study, or participation in another investigational device
or drug trial in the previous 30 days.

Study design
This prospective, stratified, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
multicenter phase II study was conducted between December 2005 and
November 2008 at 16 sites in the United States and 4 sites in Australia. The
study followed the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written
informed consent was obtained for each subject and an institutional
review board approved the study at each site.
Subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive placebo or
palifermin by i.v. bolus injections. The randomization scheme was stratified
on TBI use (yes or no), matched donor type (related or unrelated) and
source of donor cells (marrow or PBPC).
Day 0 was defined as the day of marrow or PBPC transplantation. The
recommended dosing schedule for conditioning regimens was from day
11 to day 2. Palifermin 60 mg/kg daily (or matching placebo) was
administered on 3 consecutive days before the start of the conditioning
regimen. A single dose of palifermin 180 mg/kg or placebo was
administered at least 24 h after the last dose of myeloablative
chemotherapy or radiation, at least 96 h after the last 60 mg/kg dose of
study medication and at least 24 h before the first post-transplant dose of
MTX.
Subjects received MTX for GVHD prophylaxis on days 1, 3 and 6
(planned), and on day 11 (if toxicity allowed) at doses of 15, 10, 10 and
10 mg/m2
, respectively. A calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporine or tacrolimus)
was administered with MTX and dosed per institutional norms. Filgrastim
was not required but could be administered per the standard practice at
each institution.
Subjects were evaluated for efficacy once weekly (±3 days) for 8 weeks,
and then at days 70, 84 and 100 (±7 days). The severity of acute GVHD
was evaluated with the modified Keystone criteria assessment scale,14
based on physical exam and laboratory serum values. Biopsies of affected
organs were obtained when possible. The degree of GVHD in individual
organs was scored by at least two qualified assessors at the site who were
blinded to study medication assignment. The investigator reviewed any
discrepant GVHD scores. Two experts (EKW and MJ) independently
reviewed GVHD scoring for each enrolled subject.
Trained assessors at each site used the WHO criteria15 to assess oral
mucositis severity at screening and then once daily during hospitalization,
from the first day of the conditioning regimen until the subject was
discharged or day 28, whichever was earlier. Thereafter, if the subject had
grade 3 -- 4 oral mucositis, the daily oral mucositis assessments were to
continue until oral mucositis returned to grade p2. As few assessors as
possible were assigned at each site to keep the assessments consistent.
Adverse events and concomitant medications were recorded at each
assessment. For each adverse event, the investigator recorded details such
as the severity, seriousness, relationship to study medication and
resolution of the event. A blood sample for serum palifermin Ab assays
was obtained on day 28. Antibodies against palifermin were assayed by an
electrochemiluminescence-based immunoassay; a positive test was
followed by a cell-based assay for neutralizing antibodies. Information
about the use of the total parenteral nutrition was collected up until
engraftment or day 28, whichever occurred first.
Efficacy and safety end points
The primary efficacy end point was the subject incidence of severe (grade
3 -- 4), acute GVHD. Secondary efficacy end points included the incidence of
grade 2 -- 4 acute GVHD, the incidence of MTX prophylaxis on day 11, the
incidence of severe oral mucositis (grade 3 -- 4), the duration of severe oral
mucositis (overall and among subjects with severe oral mucositis), the
incidence of parenteral or transdermal opioid analgesic use and the
incidence of total parenteral nutrition. The incidence and duration of grade
2 -- 4 oral mucositis were exploratory efficacy end points. Safety was
assessed by the subject incidence of adverse events, Ab formation,
neutrophil engraftment (ANC X1.0  109
/L for 3 consecutive days or
X10.0  109
/L for 1 day) and platelet engraftment (X20  109
/L) by day
100. Neutrophil and platelet counts were done on a weekly basis to
coincide with weekly GVHD assessment. Although participating centers
followed institutional criteria of checking counts more frequently prior to
engraftment, these data were not captured for purposes of the study. Thus,
conventional criteria of neutrophil and platelet engraftment could not be
followed during the conduct of the study. Previous studies in both
autologous and allogeneic transplant did not report any detrimental
impact of palifermin on neutrophil and platelet engraftment.9 - 12
Statistical analysis
Efficacy analyses included all randomized subjects. Safety analyses
included all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study
medication. The study was designed to provide an estimate of the
incidence of severe GVHD in an allogeneic transplant setting and was not
powered to provide definitive proof of efficacy. The planned sample size
was 200 subjects. Because of slow enrollment, a decision was made by the
sponsor in consultation with a data-safety monitoring board to terminate
the study at 155 subjects. This still allowed an acceptable level of precision
for the estimate of the primary end point in this exploratory study and
allowed the results to be available up to 12 months earlier. Estimates of
treatment differences between palifermin and placebo were provided with
95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the incidence of severe GVHD and other
incidence end points. The Cochran --Mantel --Haenszel weight was used to
combine estimates across randomization strata.
RESULTS
Subject disposition
Subject disposition is summarized in Figure 1. Of the 187 potential
subjects screened, 155 subjects met the eligibility criteria and
were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n ¼ 78) or palifermin
(n ¼ 77). Two of the subjects in the placebo group received a dose
of commercial palifermin in error; they were included in the
placebo group for efficacy analyses and the palifermin group for
safety analyses. A total of 151 subjects received at least one dose
of study treatment (75 (96%) placebo, 76 (99%) palifermin), most
completed study treatment (69 (88%) placebo, 71 (92%)
palifermin) and most completed the study (63 (81%) placebo, 55
(71%) palifermin).
Baseline demographics and treatment characteristics
Baseline demographics of study participants and the donor source
and type were generally similar between treatment groups
(Table 1). The use of study medication and TBI were also similar
between treatment groups (Table 2). Approximately half of the
subjects in each treatment group received TBI (35 (48%) placebo,
40 (51%) palifermin), with a mean±s.d. of 1269.9±149.5 cGy in
the placebo group and 1236.1±222.3 cGy in the palifermin group.
Chemotherapy doses were similar between treatment groups
(Table 2). The mean CY doses were similar between the two
treatment groups (100.3±28.7 vs 100.4±34.4 mg/kg), but more
subjects in the palifermin group received CY (57 (78%) placebo, 64
(82%) palifermin), which was given with either TBI or BU (30 (41%)
placebo, 33 (42%) palifermin). Compared with the placebo group,
fewer subjects in the palifermin group received fludarabine (10
(14%) placebo, 5 (6%) palifermin). Melphalan and etoposide use
was similar between treatment groups.
Of the 151 subjects who received study medication, 11 (7%), 82
(55%), and 51 (33%) received the collapsed dose on days 2, 1
and day 0 (day of transplant), respectively. In all, 5 (3%) subjects
did not receive a transplant and 2 (1%) others did not receive the
collapsed dose.
Efficacy
The between-group differences for GVHD outcomes are shown in
Figure 2. The subject incidence of the primary efficacy end point,
grade 3 -- 4 acute GVHD, was similar between the placebo and
palifermin groups (12 (17%) vs 12 (16%); difference (95% CI): 0.5%
(11.0%, 12.1%)). The subject incidence of the secondary efficacy

end point, grade 2 -- 4 acute GVHD, was lower in the placebo group
than in the palifermin group (29 (40%) vs 43 (58%); difference
(95% CI): 17.9% (33.4%, 2.4%)). The proportion of subjects
who received the final, optional dose of MTX on day 11 was similar

between the placebo and palifermin groups (56 (72%) vs 60 (78%);
difference (95% CI): 6.5% (19.4%, 6.4%)).
The incidences were similar between the placebo and
palifermin groups (Figure 2) for severe (grade 3 -- 4) oral mucositis
(57 (73%) vs 62 (81%)), grade 2 -- 4 oral mucositis (69 (88%) vs 69
(90%)), parenteral or transdermal opioid use (50 (64%) vs 48 (62%))
and total parenteral nutrition (38 (49%) vs 43 (56%)). The duration
of oral mucositis was also similar between treatment groups
(Table 3), including both the duration of severe oral mucositis
(overall and among those subjects with severe oral mucositis) and
the duration of grade 2 -- 4 oral mucositis.
Safety
Most subjects reported at least one adverse event (72 (99%)
placebo, 77 (99%) palifermin). There were no clinically significant
differences in the subject incidences of individual adverse events
between the treatment groups (Table 4).
Study drug-related adverse events were reported for 23 (32%)
placebo subjects and 31 (40%) palifermin subjects. The most
commonly reported adverse events that the investigator con￾sidered related to the study treatment are shown in Table 5.
Adverse events in three subjects (2 (3%) placebo, 1 (1%)
palifermin) and disease progression in six subjects (2 (3%) placebo,
4 (5%) palifermin) were reported as reasons for study discontinua￾tion. Deaths were reported for 13 subjects during the study (5 (6%)
placebo, 8 (10%) palifermin), and 5 subjects within 100 days after
the study (2 (3%) placebo, 3 (3%) palifermin). The investigators did
not consider any of these deaths to be related to the study
medication.
Documented neutrophil count (ANC X10.0  109
/L) occurred in
22 (30%) placebo subjects and 30 (38%) palifermin subjects; the
proportion of subjects who achieved a lower ANC target on 3
consecutive days could not be analyzed because ANC values were
not collected daily. Platelet engraftment (X20  109
/L) occurred
in 69 (95%) placebo subjects and 74 (95%) palifermin subjects.
One (1%) palifermin subject had a seropositive result for anti￾palifermin antibodies during screening, prior to palifermin
administration; this subject was retested with negative results

on day 28. Seronegative results were obtained from 65 (89%)
placebo subjects and 66 (85%) palifermin subjects. The remaining
subjects were not tested for anti-palifermin antibodies.
DISCUSSION
Preclinical studies suggested that palifermin decreased GVHD
incidence and lethality without decreasing graft-vs-tumor effect.6 - 8
In patients with hematologic malignancies receiving myelotoxic
therapy requiring hematopoietic stem cell support, palifermin
treatment was associated with significant decreases in the
incidence and duration of WHO grade 4 and grade 3 -- 4 mucositis,
along with improvement in patient-reported outcomes, use of
opioid analgesics and the total parenteral nutrition.9,16 However,
most of those studies evaluated the effects of palifermin among
patients undergoing autologous SCT after an intensive, fractio￾nated TBI-based conditioning regimen.
In allo-SCT, mucositis is related not only to the preparative
regimen but also is compounded by the MTX that is used for
GVHD prophylaxis.5 The exact post-preparative dosing regimen for
palifermin in allo-SCT is not as clearly defined by clinical data as is
the case for autologous-SCT. Several investigators have studied
palifermin in allo-SCT---with the intent of decreasing GVHD and
sparing graft-vs-tumor effect---using a post-preparative dose of
60 mg/kg daily for at least 3 days,10 - 13 which is the same post￾preparative dose that was used in studies of autologous SCT.9
Using this dosing regimen, a retrospective study concluded that
palifermin decreased the incidence of acute GVHD compared with
historical controls and it decreased mucositis, opioid requirements
and the total parenteral nutrition.10 However, another retro￾spective cohort study showed no effect of palifermin on GVHD in
allo-SCT.11 In a prospective, randomized trial, Blazar et al.
12
investigated various dosing regimens of palifermin in allo-SCT and
concluded there were no significant differences in acute GVHD
incidence, acute GVHD severity, survival or day 100 relapse rates
between the palifermin and placebo groups. Palifermin was
associated with reduced incidence and severity of mucositis
(measured three times weekly), but only in patients conditioned
with fractionated TBI-based regimens.12 Levine et al.
13 reported on
the long-term outcomes of this cohort and found no difference
between the palifermin and placebo groups in the incidence of
chronic GVHD or relapse risk. As shown in some of the prior
trials,11,12 there was no positive impact of palifermin on either
grade 2 -- 4 or grade 3 -- 4 acute GVHD incidence or severity.
Mucositis was monitored stringently in this study, with once￾daily assessments by the trained investigators compared with
assessments three times weekly in the prior randomized study.12
Although the previous studies reported a decrease in mucositis,10 - 12
this study did not show any benefit in mucositis incidence, opioid
use or the total parenteral nutrition. The altered, collapsed dose
and timing for the post-preparative regimen could have been
contributing factors. The approved dosing schedule for palifermin
includes three daily 60 mg/kg doses before conditioning and three
daily 60 mg/kg doses after transplant. In the current study, subjects
received the recommended doses of palifermin prior to condition￾ing, but a collapsed dosing regimen with a single dose of palifermin
180 mg/kg was used after conditioning. Additionally, the post￾preparative dose of palifermin was often administered prior to
transplant on day 1 or 2 to try to augment mucositis protection
prior to initiating MTX on day 1 for GVHD prophylaxis. Use of the
collapsed dose of palifermin as the post-dose, combined with the
difference in timing compared with the currently approved dose
and schedule of palifermin, may be an important limitation in the
extrapolation of these results to the expected effects of the
approved dosing schedule for palifermin in this setting.
Grade 2 -- 4 acute GVHD was reported in a higher proportion of
patients receiving palifermin compared with placebo. The exact
reason for this is not clear. Palifermin-induced skin rashes tend to
occur early after administration of the drug and are transient.
Although skin rashes post-transplant could be misdiagnosed as
skin GVHD, the timing of the rash immediately after the
conditioning regimen and prior to engraftment, the recommen￾dation to pursue a skin biopsy on the study prior to the diagnosis
of skin GVHD and blinded assessment by two physicians of weekly
assessment of acute GVHD data make this an unlikely cause for
the higher incidence of GVHD in the palifermin group. Long-term
follow-up of the present study is ongoing at 6 months and at 1, 2,
3, 4 and 5 years to evaluate chronic GVHD, disease status and
secondary malignancies.
Neutrophil engraftment rates were similar between treatment
groups. Neutrophil engraftment was defined as ANC of
X1.0  109
/L for 3 consecutive days or ANC of X10.0  109
/L
for 1 day, whichever was sooner. The ANC target of X1.0  109
/L
for 3 consecutive days could not be used in this study because at
no time were ANC results scheduled to be collected on 3
consecutive days. Thus, the lower-than-expected neutrophil
engraftment in the current study was attributable to the higher
single-day engraftment criteria.
The original sample size of the study was 200 subjects, but
because of slow enrollment, the study was stopped after only 155
subjects were randomized. The decision to stop the study was
made by the sponsor in consultation with a data-safety
monitoring board. Stopping the study early enabled the release
of the results sooner, while still allowing the objectives of this
exploratory study to be fulfilled in providing an estimate of severe
GVHD. As this was an estimation study, reducing the sample size
would only affect the precision for the estimate of the primary end
point. If the results had demonstrated superior efficacy to support
the need for additional trials, stopping this study early would have
enabled those trials to begin sooner, perhaps by as much as
1 year. Unfortunately, the study results showed a treatment
difference of only 1% for the primary efficacy end point of grade
3 -- 4 acute GVHD (17% placebo vs 16% palifermin), which was well
below any efficacy threshold to pursue further studies.
Clinical trials are often planned based on important findings in
animal models of transplantation. However, human studies often
do not confirm these findings, making extrapolation from animal
models complex and challenging. Palifermin showed clinical
benefit as a mucoprotective agent in autologous hematopoietic
cell transplantation,9 but the hope of palifermin as an agent to
prevent GVHD without losing graft-vs-tumor effect in allo-SCT has
not been realized in this study. Based on the findings of this
exploratory study, no additional, larger study is planned to
evaluate this dose of palifermin (three daily doses of 60 mg/kg
before allo-SCT and a single, collapsed dose of 180 mg/kg after
conditioning therapy but before allo-SCT) to reduce GVHD or oral
mucositis in allo-SCT.
