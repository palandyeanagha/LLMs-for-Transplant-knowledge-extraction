Abstract
Habitual supplementation of fish oil is thought to provide benefits to the developing infant; however, the effects on infant
microbial establishment and immune development are unknown. A 6-month observational cohort study was conducted
where 47 out of 91 women self-administered dietary fish oil during breastfeeding. Infant stool and mothers’ breast milk were
collected each month over 6 months. Gas chromatography was used to quantify breast milk fatty acids and high-throughput
sequencing was used to assess the infant fecal microbiota. Immune markers and parent-reported questionnaires were used to
assess infant immunity and health up to 2 years. Our results reveal that fish oil supplementation decreased secretory
immunoglobulin A and increased IL-10 production in lactating women along with increased breast milk eicosapentaenoic
acid, and this corresponded to increased abundances of fecal Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus spp. in their infants.
Docosahexaenoic acid levels in breast milk aligned with decreases in infant gut bacterial richness and the predicted bacterial
phenotypes suggested that fish oil lowers commensal traits involved in pathogen colonization resistance. Despite this, there
were no differences in sickness incidence in toddlers. This study revealed that fish oil associates with decreases in breast
milk defensive inflammatory responses and corresponds with infant fecal microbiota with anti-inflammatory potential.
Introduction
Prenatal supplementation with fish oil, rich in n-3 poly￾unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) like eicosapentaenoic acid
(EPA, C20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6n￾3), is recommended since deficiency negatively impacts
visual development [1], behavior [2], and cognition [3].
Accordingly, n-3 PUFAs are predicted to provide beneficial
effects on infant health and development [4]. The neonatal
period is a critical time for development of the intestinal
microbiome and the immune system, both of which influ￾ence enteric infection susceptibility. We have previously
shown that the gut microbiome alters enteric infection in
rodents [5]. Of the factors important in shaping the gut
microbiome in neonates, breast milk is the most influential
[6]. While fish oil supplementation during lactation has
been hypothesized to be beneficial on infant development
[7], three recent meta-analyses concluded that n-3 PUFAs
do not improve physiological outcomes [8–10] and may
suppress infant immunity [10].
Dietary n-3 PUFAs decrease pro-inflammatory responses
[11–15], and supplementation does increase risk for infec￾tion (reviewed in [16]). Similarly, we have shown that mice
fed fish oil have an altered microbiome and immune cell
balance which correlated with fatal sepsis during acute
colitis infection [17, 18]. Other rodent studies also found
dietary n-3 PUFA increased susceptibility to enteric
pathogens like Helicobacter pylori [19], Mycobacterium
tuberculosis [20, 21], Listeria monocytogenes [22, 23],
Salmonella enterica Enteritidis [24], as well as respiratory
pathogens like Paracoccidioides brasiliensis [25] and
influenza [26–28]. While the former studies were

postnatally exposed to fish oil, we have shown that maternal
fish oil exposure in rodents resulted in their offspring pre￾programmed in their T-cell biology [29], shown to increase
susceptibility to colitis [30]. If these findings hold true in
humans, the widespread practice of prenatal fish oil sup￾plementation could provoke dysfunctional gut immunity in
infants. It is currently unknown how fish oil supplementa￾tion affects intestinal colonization by the microbiota during
infancy, a critical time when immune tolerance and disease
susceptibility patterns develop.
The purpose of this study was to determine if fish oil
supplementation during breastfeeding alters infant immu￾nity and gut microbiota. We found that fish oil increased
EPA in breast milk corresponding with a decrease in
secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA). These breast milk
alterations were associated with an infant microbial com￾position that predicted reduced immune priming, although
there were no changes in self-reported illness between the
two groups over a 2-year period. These data suggest that
fish oil supplmentation to lactating mothers could be a risk
factor for increasing susceptibility to infectious disease in
their offspring.
Subjects and methods
Subjects and study design
The research protocol was approved by the UBC Clinical
Research Ethics Board and BC Interior Health Ethics
Board, and written informed consent was obtained from
participants. The trial was conducted according to
Declaration of Helsinki principles and registered at https://
clinicaltrials.gov (identifier NCT03297801). Study design,
recruitment, and subjects are previously described [31].
Briefly, a prospective cohort clinical study was conducted in
the Okanagan Valley, BC, Canada where lactating women,
who either did or did not supplement their diets with fish oil
until their infants were 6 months of age, were recruited. The
inclusion criteria required medically certified healthy, full￾term infants who obtained over 75% of their daily nutri￾tional intake from breast milk. Preterm infants (≤37 weeks
of gestation), infants diagnosed with congenital disorders,
or infants introduced to solid foods were excluded. There
were no exclusion criteria for the mothers.
One hundred and nine women–infant pairs were recrui￾ted, where 18 were excluded and the remaining 91 women
(plus one twinset) were included in the final analysis. Forty￾seven women self-administered fish oil (on average 500 ±
104 mg EPA and 303 ± 63 mg DHA daily) over the 6-
month period and 44 women did not supplement. Infor￾mation about delivery, antibiotic treatment, anthropometric
measurements of the infant, formula intake, vaccination
compliance, and demographics of the parents was collected
monthly to account for confounding variables. Of the par￾ticipants included, 7 infants received formula in the hospital
and 14 (8 in fish oil and 6 in no fish oil cohort) were
partially supplemented with formula milk over the course of
the study.
Infant stool and breast milk sample collection
Infant stool samples were collected, stored, and processed
as previously described [32], at 1 week of age, and once per
month until 6 months. Concurrently, breast milk samples
from the mothers were collected the morning of infant stool
collection. Before sample collection, wearing sterile gloves,
the women cleaned the nipple and surrounding area with
warm water and soap, and manually expressed a few drops
of milk before collecting 10 mL of foremilk in a sterile tube.
The part of the pump that contacted the breast and all the
materials used to collect milk were cleansed well and ster￾ilized before each use. All samples were kept at −20 °C for
<4 h before being transported to the laboratory using dry
ice, and then stored at −80 °C until analysis. Instructions
and sterile collection packages for samples were given to
the participants every month.
Breast milk fatty acids and dietary intake analysis
To understand the relationship between dietary intake and
breast milk fatty acid composition, participants were asked
to fill out a 24-h dietary recall each sample collection day to
correlate dietary intake and supplementing patterns with the
coinciding stool and breast milk samples collected. The
dietary questionnaires were assessed by a research dietitian
and entered into the NCI automated self-administered
(ASA24) dietary assessment tool, a web-based tool for
24-h dietary analysis. The data output from this tool
included a summary of dietary nutrients in grams, con￾sumed by the participants. Grams of dietary lipids were
converted to relative abundances for direct comparison with
the lipids quantified from breast milk. Since dietary recalls
are not always good indicators of breast milk fatty acids, the
medium- and long-chain fatty acids in breast milk were then
chemically quantified using gas chromatography (GC) as
previously described [33]. To understand if the two cohorts
(mothers self-administering fish oil supplements or not) had
different breast milk fatty acids while accounting for infant
age, a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was
used. Of the chemically quantified breast milk fatty acids,
C13:0, C16:0, C18:1n-9, C18:2n-6, C20:1n-9, C20:5n-3
(EPA), C22:5n-3, and C22:6n-3 (DHA) were selected as
explanatory variables based on a priori interest and pub￾lished animal models. To evaluate the relationship between
dietary recalls and quantified breast milk lipids, a pairwise

rank correlation followed by a Procrustes rotation and
PROTEST permutation test was performed.
Immune function markers
Immune markers, sIgA, IgE, and pro and anti-inflammatory
cytokines [granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
factor, interferon gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL￾2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 (p70), monocyte chemoattractant
protein-1, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), IL-13, and
IL-5] were measured from breast milk and stool supernatant
at 1 week, 1 month and 5 months of age, using multiplex
assays (Eve Technologies Calgary, Canada).
Sickness incidence
Infant mucosal illness was recorded by primary caregivers
for a 2-year time period using an online sickness incidence
form as described [31]. Caregivers were asked to complete
the online questionnaire each time their infants were sick
and were sent monthly reminders.
16S sequencing methods
16S rRNA sequencing was used for bacterial identification
[34] of the V3-V4 region, as previously [31]. The 2 × 300
paired end reads were sequenced on a MiSeq system with a
V3 chemistry kit at The Applied Genomics Core in
Edmonton, AB.
Bioinformatics
All bioinformatics was conducted using Quantitative
Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME2) [35]. Forward
sequences underwent quality filtering, dereplication, chi￾mera removal and denoising using the Deblur plugin [36]
with default settings. A Naive Bayes classifier was trained
for our primer sets using the Greenegenes (13_8) reference
database sequences based on 99% similarity. Taxonomic
classification was collapsed and assigned at each phyloge￾netic level. For phylogenetic-based analyses, MAFFT￾aligned [37] sequences were used to produce a phylogeny
tree using the fast-tree method [38] with default settings.
Microbial data were rarefied to a sampling depth of 4380 for
the whole cohort and 5924 for exploratory subset analysis
and had an average frequency of 19,738 and 19,330 per
sample, respectively.
Statistical methods
Statistical analyses were performed using R [39] version
3.3.0. Results are expressed as mean values ± standard
errors of the mean (SEM) unless otherwise stated. For
demographic and dietary fish consumption comparisons,
Fisher’s exact and chi-squared tests were used. A Pearson
correlation analysis assessed associations between dietary
intake and breast milk fatty acids. Phyloseq was used to
generate alpha diversity indexes and distance matrices
based on the rarefied feature table. A pairwise comparison
of alpha diversity measures was conducted in QIIME2
followed by a mixed-effects model using lme4 to account
for infant sex, mode of delivery (MOD), probiotic supple￾mentation, and infant age. Microbial communities in the
fish oil groups were visualized using a PCoA on a
Bray–Curtis dissimilarity matrix the Vegan package and
visualized using ggplot2. LEfSe evaluated statistical sig￾nificance and effect size of taxa abundances [40] where
features with fewer than ten counts across all samples or
appearing in fewer than five samples were removed. A
multiclass comparison was performed using the
Kruskal–Wallis test (α = 0.05), and a linear discriminant
analysis (LDA) score for discriminative features set to 2.0.
The biologically relevant features were visualized in a cla￾dogram. BugBase [41] determined if fish oil associated with
any predictive phenotypes and the type of bacteria was
predicted using VSEARCH [42] at 97% similarity. Statis￾tical analysis of the predictions was done using a pairwise
Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test.
Relationship between breast milk fatty acids and
the infant bacteriome
A multiple regression analysis was conducted using an open
source R code [43]. Only participants with complete data set
including GC-quantified breast milk and infant stool sam￾ples at months 2, 3, and 4 were assessed resulting in
24 subjects for this exploratory analysis. All the included
infants in this subset analysis were exclusively breast fed.
Potential predictors of microbial composition were screened
using a Spearman correlation matrix and fatty acids that
exhibited a significant correlation with alpha diversity
species richness were included. Multicollinearity between
fatty acids was checked using the variable inflation factor
index with a maximum cut-off score of 10. The microbial
communities were analyzed using two complementary
multivariate approaches: (1) constrained ordination using
RDA, focusing on community composition differences in
relation to predictors of interest, and (2) multiple general￾ized linear models. Because of our interest in age effects,
each infant age was assessed separately while acknowl￾edging increased potential for type-1 errors. Fatty acids
included: tridecylic acid (C13:0), palmitic acid (C16:0),
oleic acid (C18:1n-9), linoleic acid (C18:2n-6), EPA
(C20:5n-3), docosapentaenoic acid (C22:5n-3), and DHA
(C22:6n-3). Abundance data at each taxonomic level along
with the fatty acids were Hellinger transformed [44].
2092 C. Quin et al.

Variable selection in RDA was implemented using the
ordistep function in Vegan version 2.4–4, using both for￾ward and backward stepwise inclusion. Features with a
significant correlation coefficient based on the first two axes
(evaluated at a Bonferroni-adjusted alpha level) were dis￾played on the RDA plots with type II scaling. To evaluate
the association of genus abundance with explanatory vari￾ables, we implemented multiple negative binomial GLMs
using the mvabund package [45] version 3.12.3, which uses
a series of univariate F-tests of the effects of predictor
variables on the abundance of each taxon, while adjusting
for multiple testing. Residual diagnostics were used to
assess regression assumptions. Microbes were filtered and
any taxa that made up <0.1% of the total count and
occurring in <75% of samples were removed (cf. [46]).
Seven taxa met the inclusion criteria at 3 months of age and
four taxa met the inclusion criteria at 4 months of age and
were included in the model. To explore the relationship
between the microbial communities and the breast milk
fatty acids over time and to test the significance of the
identified relationship, Procrustes rotation and PROTEST
permutation tests were implemented in Vegan based on the
RDAs which showed a significant accord between breast
milk fatty acids and infant stool microbial communities
[47, 48]. A LDA using the MASS [49] package in R was
used to determine whether the quantified immune markers
could discriminate between the two supplementing groups.
The collected data sets were first split into a training set and
a test set. We trained the LDA model and then validated our
results using the test data set to predict the supplementing
group. This was followed by an MANOVA with Wilks’
lambda test for comparisons. Immune data were first
“scaled” in R using default settings to accommodate dif￾ferences in measurements. IFNγ, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12,
TNFα, IL-5, and sIgA were included in the LDA model and
MANOVA at 1 and 5 months. Given sample size limita￾tions, at 1 week of age the immune model was reduced to
IL-10 and sIgA, based on findings at 1 and 5 months. The
remaining immune cells were tested using Student’s t tests.
Non-detects were treated as zero values. For group com￾parisons of breast milk lipids, an MANOVA with Wilks’
lambda test was ran on “logit” transformed lipid proportions
at each age. In all cases, model fit was visually inspected
using diagnostic plots of the residuals.
Results
The study aims were to: understand how habitual fish oil
supplementation during lactation alters bioactive con￾stituents in breast milk and infant stool; determine if fish oil
supplementation was associated with changes to the infant
microbial composition; explore the relationship between
specific breast milk fatty acids and infant microbial diver￾sity; and determine if fish oil supplementation corresponded
with altered parent-reported incidence of infection by 2
years of age. The flow of participants throughout the trial is
detailed in Fig. S1. Of the 91 mothers to complete the study,
62 provided at least one breast milk sample over a 6-month
period for paired comparisons. Participants were mostly
well-educated and of Euro–Canadian descent with similar
household income, maternal age, gestational age, and infant
birth characteristics between the two groups (Table S1).
Fish oil supplementation associates with increased
n-3 PUFA in breast milk and decreased defensive
inflammation
No differences in dietary fish consumption were reported by
the participants. The Procrustes rotation analyses and pro￾test tests showed a significant accord between mothers
reported dietary intake and fatty acids quantified in breast
milk (Table 1). This suggested that the overall profile of
lipid intake data of mothers from the questionnaire corre￾lated with the overall profile of lipids measured in their
breast milk. Without adjusting for multiple testing, pairwise
rank correlations revealed significant associations between
maternal dietary consumption and breast milk fatty acids,
but the results were inconsistent over time (Table 1).
Therefore, all forthcoming analyses using breast milk fatty
acids were conducted on the GC-quantified fatty acids.
Assessment of the breast milk lipid profile (Fig. 1a)
revealed that participants supplementing with fish oil (500
± 104 mg EPA and 303 ± 63 mg DHA daily average) had a
higher proportion of EPA (C20:5n-3) in their breast milk at
1, 4, and 5 months postpartum despite no detectable dif￾ferences in DHA (C22:6n-3) or alpha-linolenic acid
(C18:3n-3) (Table S2). The mothers supplementing habi￾tually with fish oil had lower amounts arachidonic acid
(C20:4n-6) at 1 week and 2 months of breastfeeding as well
as eicosatrienoic acid (C20:3n-3) at 1 week, 1, 3 and,
4 months of breastfeeding. Therefore, self-administration of
fish oil supplements correlated with changes to the bioactive
constituents in breast milk. The percent compositions of all
quantified breast milk fatty acids are available in Table S2.
In addition to changes in fatty acid percent composition,
changes to breast milk immune markers were associated
with fish oil supplementation (Table S3). LDA predicted
the supplementing group at 1 month with a 61.5% accuracy
(P = 0.05) based on IFN-γ, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12,
TNF-α, and sIgA concentrations in breast milk. The groups
were different predominantly due to the higher anti￾inflammatory cytokine, IL-10 (P = 0.058) in the fish oil
group. At 5 months, the LDA model predicted the supple￾menting group with a 62.5% accuracy (P = 0.05) between
the two cohorts. Results from the MANOVA showed that

the fish oil group had lower sIgA, an important mucosal
defense factor (Fig. 1b). In contrast, IgE, which plays a role
in allergies [50], was similar between the two groups. IL-10
and sIgA were included in the LDA model at 1 week and
they predicted the fish oil group with a 75% accuracy (P =
0.16). Overall, the LDA was able to discriminate between
the two groups based on quantified immune markers where
fish oil supplementation was associated with decreased
protective sIgA and increased anti-inflammatory IL-10.
Habitual fish oil supplementation augments
bacteria with reduced immune priming potential
Fecal bacterial diversity was assessed to determine if fish oil
supplementation associated with changes to the infant
microbial composition. The mixed-effects model found no
overall difference in alpha diversity measures between the
supplemented and non-supplemented cohorts (Fig. 2a);
however, pairwise comparisons found lower Shannon’s
diversity and Pielou’s evenness, two alpha diversity
indexes, at 5 months in the fish oil group (Table S4).
Pairwise comparisons of weighted and unweighted UniFrac
distance matrices revealed marginal (P = 0.08) differences
in the presence of fecal bacteria between the two infant
groups at 1 week of age only. This observation was
followed-up with LEfSe [40], which showed infants in the
fish oil group had higher abundances of Bifidobacterium,
Lactobacillus, and Bacteroides spp. in stool, whereas the
non-fish oil group had an abundance of Firmicutes phyla
(Fig. 2b). Collectively, these data show a positive
association between fish oil supplementation and bacteria
commonly present in high abundances in breast-fed and
vaginally birthed babies that have been shown to induce
anti-inflammatory responses [51, 52].
Breast milk EPA and DHA predict infant gut
microbial diversity
Breast milk DHA corresponds with lower alpha diversity
measures in infants
To gain a better understanding of which specific breast milk
fatty acids influence the infant fecal microbiota, eight breast
milk fatty acids of a priori interest were included as
potential predictors of alpha diversity on corresponding
infant stool sets at months 2, 3, and 4. In addition, infant sex
and MOD were included as they have previously been
shown to influence microbial diversity. We constructed
separate multiple regressions for each diversity index,
which exhibited collinearity (Figs. S2–S4). After pre￾screening, all the potential predictors using a Spearman
correlation analysis, DHA (C22:6n-3) in breast milk, infant
sex, and MOD were included in the multiple regression
model (Table 2). At 2 months of age, species richness was
negatively associated with breast milk DHA and vaginal
deliveries (Fig. 3a). Faith’s PD similarly showed a negative
association with DHA but not infant sex or MOD. None of
the predictors were associated with Shannon diversity or
Pielou’s Evenness at 2 months of age. At 3 months, vaginal
deliveries negatively associated with Shannon diversity, but

not species richness, Pielou’s evenness, or Faith’s PD
(Fig. 3b). In contrast, Faith’s PD positively correlated with
male infants and the percent composition of breast milk
palmitic acid (C16:0). At 4 months, DHA was negatively
associated with species richness, Faith’s PD, and Shannon
diversity. Male sex was likewise positively associated with
species richness and Faith’s PD. MOD did not reach sta￾tistical significance (Fig. 3c). Overall, breast milk DHA
corresponds with lower alpha diversity measures over time
in the developing microbiome of infants.
Overall gut bacterial community composition is dictated by
EPA and DHA
Overall, ~84 genera from nine phyla were represented
across all participants (Table 3). The fish oil group included
representation from 57.7 ± 3.1 genera, while the no fish oil
group was made up of 58.0 ± 1.5 genera at the reported
ages. None of the breast milk fatty acids were selected as
meaningful explanatory variables of infant fecal genera at
2 months of age, but oleic acid (C18:1n-9), EPA (C20:5n￾3), DHA (C22:6n-3), and MOD were selected at 3 months
of age, and tridecylic acid (C13:0), EPA, DHA, and MOD
were selected at 4 months of age as determined by Monte
Carlo Permutation Procedure at 1000 permutations
(Table S5). In all, 14.52% and 13.34% of the total variation
in taxon composition was attributed to these fatty acids as
explanatory variables at ages 3 and 4 months, respectively
(Fig. 4). Genera that were significantly correlated with at
least one of the first two RDA axes are highlighted. The
results illustrate that EPA in breast milk correlated with
Bifidobacterium, and Streptococcus spp. and MOD corre￾lated with Bacteroides. While DHA was selected as a sig￾nificant predictor at both months 3 and 4, it did not
consistently align with any of the selected genera. At
3 months DHA aligned with Enterobacteriaceae (Fig. 4a)
but this finding was not apparent at 4 months (Fig. 4b).
Oleic acid correlated with Lactobacillus spp. at 3 months
and tridecylic acid with Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus
spp. at 4 months, similar to EPA. Clostridium spp. corre￾lated with RDA1 but was not associated with the predictor
fatty acids included in our model. As EPA was increased in
the breast milk of supplementing mothers, and this was
validated using LEfSe. As expected, LEfSe shows an

self-administering fish oil supplements during lactation had a sig￾nificantly lower proportion of eicosatrienoic acid (C20:3n-3) and
arachidonic acid (C20:4n-6) in their breast milk and a higher pro￾portion of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5n-3), an omega-3 PUFA

docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6n-3) after correcting for multiple
testing. b The prevalence of breast milk sIgA was similar between the
two cohorts at 1 week and 1 month of age. In contrast, at 5 months the
no fish oil group had higher breast milk sIgA (22:18). IgE was not
affected by fish oil exposure at 5 months. *P ≤ 0.05 by MANOVA.

ordination results. The correlation diagnostics gave a Pro￾crustes sum of squares value (m12) of 0.55 and a correlation
in symmetric Procrustes rotation of 0.6682 which was sig￾nificant (P = 0.001) when using 3- and 4-month RDA
scores, respectively. This suggests a high degree of corre￾spondence between the 3- and 4-month assemblages.
Overall, breast milk EPA consistently aligns with abun￾dances of Bifidobacterium, and MOD aligns with Bacter￾oides at 3 and 4 months of age. Oleic acid, tridecylic acid,
and DHA were also highlighted as potential predictors of
microbial diversity but the results were not consistent over
time.
Fish oil predicts reduced commensal colonization
resistance
We furthered our exploratory analysis by assessing whether
fish oil was associated with any predicted high-level phe￾notypes. The results revealed a predicted increase in the
relative abundance of Gram-positive bacteria in the fish oil
cohort and a corresponding decrease in Gram-negative
bacteria at 2 months of age (Fig. 5a, b). In addition, our
findings indicate that fish oil supplementation corresponded
with lower abundances of biofilm forming, mobile element
containing, and stress tolerant bacteria at 2 months of age
(Fig. 5c–e).
Fish oil supplementation does not associate with
changes to rates of infections in infants
Nineteen mothers in the fish oil cohort and ten mothers in
the no fish oil cohort participated in a 2-year follow-up on
their infant’s health. Unlike the mothers’ breast milk,
infant stool did not reveal any differences in cytokines,
sIgA, or IgE expression at 1 week, 1, or 5 months of age
(Table S3) and the LDA which incorporated immune
markers collectively was unable to predict the supple￾menting group at any time point. Similarly, both inci￾dences of mucosal infections and time required to clear
mucosal infections (duration) were statistically insignif￾icant between the groups (Fig. 5f). On average, the
mothers supplemented with fish oil reported that their
infant was sick 3.45 ± 0.61 times over a 2-year period,
with the non-supplementing group reporting 4.38 ± 1.52
times. The fish oil and no fish oil infants took an average
of 8.07 ± 1.12 and 5.86 ± 1.43 days to clear their infec￾tions, respectively.

Fish oil supplementation reduces maternal defensive inflammation and predicts a gut bacteriome with. . . 2097

Discussion
While maternal fish oil supplementation is widely believed
to support infant health, the effect on gut health is relatively
unknown. This is the first study aimed at investigating the
effects of habitual fish oil supplementation on breast milk
fatty acid composition and the infant microbial composition
from birth until 6 months of age with corresponding health
outcomes up to 2 years. Here we show that women sup￾plementing with fish oil associate with decreased defensive
inflammatory responses and produce an infant gut bacter￾iome with potentially less capacity to prime the pro￾inflammatory branches of the immune system in their
infants. Overall, habitual fish oil supplementation was not
associated with clear and better health outcomes in sup￾plemented infants.
Fig. 3 Results of a multiple regression model show a significant
association between alpha diversity measures and four of ten
predictors of interest. a At 2 months of age, Faith’s PD and Species
richness negatively correlate with breast milk DHA (C22:6n-3) levels.
Species richness also significantly correlates with MOD. b At
3 months, Faith’s PD positively correlates with sex and palmitic acid
(C16:0). Shannon diversity significantly correlates with MOD at
3 months of age. c Correlations among species richness, Faith’s PD
and Shannon diversity show a negative association with DHA at
4 months. Faith’s PD also correlates with sex. Shaded areas represent

Fish oil has two major n-3 PUFAs important for infant
development: EPA and DHA. A recent systematic review
[53] showed that with one exception [54], controlled studies
consistently supplement mothers with higher DHA than
EPA, and often with DHA exclusively. However, in this
study it was apparent that Canadian mothers supplement
with higher EPA than DHA, resulting in relatively higher
proportions of EPA in breast milk. In this study, we show
habitual administration of fish oil correlated with a greater
proportion of breast milk EPA, accompanied by a marked
decrease in the proportion of AA throughout lactation when
compared with the non-supplementing participants, similar
to previous studies [55, 56]. Fish oil supplementation also
resulted in less eicosatrienoic acid, a less reported n-3
PUFA. While eicosatrienoic acid has widely been con￾sidered a dead-end product, recent studies show desatura￾tion of eicosatrienoic acid yields eicosatetraenoic acid
(C20:4n-3) as well as immediate eicosanoid precursors [57],
which is consistent with the idea that fish oil decreases
inflammatory mediators [58].
This study shows that fish oil supplementation, primarily
driven by EPA, decreases defensive inflammation in breast
milk. Breast milk supplies the first source of antigen￾specific immune protection in the intestinal tract of infants
in the form of sIgA. sIgA has been shown to shape the
composition of the gut microbiome and prevent the trans￾location of aerobic bacteria from the neonatal gut into
lymph nodes [59]. This protects against inflammation and
promotes intestinal barrier function. This study found that
breast milk sIgA was decreased in the supplementing
mother’s breast milk at 5 months postpartum and this cor￾responded with increased levels of EPA. This is similar to
previous studies showing decreased breast milk concentra￾tions of sIgA corresponding with increased breast milk n-3
PUFA through fish consumption [60]. In addition, the anti￾inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was increased in mother’s
breast milk who supplemented with fish oil. IL-10 inhibits
the activity of pro-inflammatory Th1 cells, NK cells, and
macrophages, leading to impaired pathogen control and
clearance which can result in persistent asymptomatic
infections including Candida albicans and mycobacterial
infections (reviewed in [61]). Overall, fish oil supple￾mentation decreased critically important defense factors in
one of the only sources the infants get during early life.
In addition to reducing breast milk defense factors, there
were limited differences in the infant gut bacteriome. Fish
oil supplementation was associated with higher Bifido￾bacteria and Lactobacillus spp. at 1 week of age with no
overall differences in fecal alpha diversity. To understand
which specific breast milk fatty acids are good predictors of
microbial diversity, complete data sets at months 2, 3, and 4
were reassessed according to mothers’ breast milk fatty acid
profile. Results from a regression model showed that higher
levels of DHA in breast milk negatively correspond with
fecal species richness and phylogenetic diversity at 2 and
4 months of age. DHA proportions in breast milk were
likewise shown to contribute to microbial assemblages in
infant stool at 3 and 4 months of age. Although none of the
selected breast milk fatty acids correlated with bacterial
abundance at 2 months, our Procrustes results suggest a
high degree of concordance between the environmental
variables EPA and DHA on microbial assemblages at 3 and
4 months. One notable finding of this study is that n-3
PUFAs illicit a stronger effect on the infant bacteriome than
other more abundant breast milk fatty acids. In fact, the
global RDA model selected both EPA and DHA as mean￾ingful explanatory variables alongside MOD, which is a
known significant contributor to microbial diversity. Similar
to the results seen in the fish oil group at 1 week, the RDA
results investigating the association between individual fatty
acids and the infant gut further showed that EPA in breast
milk uniquely posed a significant association with members
of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Streptococcus,
independent of DHA. This was verified by LEfSe that
showed an increase in Bifidobacterium spp. in the fish oil
supplementing subset at 3 and 4 months of age. In support
of previous literature, our study shows that Bacteroides spp.
were associated with infant MOD [62] and that caesarian
sectioned babies have higher alpha diversity in early life
[63]. We also found that female infants had lower alpha
diversity at 3 and 4 months of age. These findings strongly
mimic rodent models performed in our lab, which showed

n-3 PUFA supplementation increases gut microbes such as
Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria spp. [17].
Previous studies have shown that Lactobacillus and
Bifidobacteria spp. have the ability to induce anti￾inflammatory response in their host [51, 64]. Generally,
these species are considered beneficial; however, they
proved unfavorable during enteric infection which resulted
in murine sepsis and mortality [17]. In this study, we did not

see any evidence that infants in the fish oil cohort had
altered immune function; however, predicted microbial
phenotypes suggested an inverse relationship between fish
oil and biofilm formation, mobile elements and stress
tolerance. While these virulence traits are usually associated
with bacterial pathogens [65], it is plausible that commensal
bacteria with these predictive traits may benefit the infant
given the immune system is primed and developed during

this period of time. For example, since commensal biofilms
occur in close juxtaposition to host epithelium, it could
indicate that these bacteria interact to a greater extent with
the immune system than their planktonic counterparts and
are more resistant against pathogen colonization [66]. In
support of this, the gut epithelia contacted by commensal
bacteria generate reactive oxygen species which could
account for increased stress tolerant bacteria in this group.
Microbial-elucidated reactive oxygen species can increase
cellular proliferation in the intestine and modulate innate
immune signaling [67]. Germ-free models have shown that
in the absence of microbial exposures, the immune system
is immature (reviewed here [68]) and that some, but not all,
bacteria act to “mature” the immune system. For instance,
previous studies have shown that Bifidobacterium longum
was not able to induce the production of RegIIIγ by Paneth
cells, whereas Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron was [69, 70].
Thus, the predicted decrease in biofilm formation, mobile
elements, and stress tolerant bacteria in the fish oil cohort
could contribute to decreased immune priming. Despite this,
we did not observe any differences in infant susceptible to
infection. A possible explanation for this might be that none
of the children in this study were critically ill or exposed to
bacterial pathogens. The “anti-inflammatory” nature of n-3
PUFA may only be detrimental when exposed to infectious
pathogens.
Overall, our findings underscore that different types of
breast milk fatty acids impart varying effects on the human
infant bacteriome. While this was an observational pro￾spective study, we demonstrated that supplementing with fish
oil increased the percent composition of EPA in breast milk,
which was associated with decreased defensive inflammatory
mediators in the infant’s nutrition source and this was asso￾ciated with a gut microbiome that had reduced immune
priming capability and predicted less colonization resistance.
Given that fish oil appears to alter the infant microbial com￾position through changes in breast milk, and that the micro￾biota is intricately linked to infant health, we recommend
large scale epidemiological studies to clarify whether early
fish oil exposures alter infectious disease susceptibility
including persistent asymptomatic chronic infections.
