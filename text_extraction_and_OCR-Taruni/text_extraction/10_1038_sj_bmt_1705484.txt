Lung injury limits the success of allogeneic stem cell
transplantation (SCT). The overall incidence varies from
30 to 50% and non-infectious causes occur in one-third to
one-half of these. We reviewed pulmonary complications
in 369 consecutive patients who received a partially T-cell￾depleted myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic SCT at
our institution between 1993 and 2003. All patients were
treated uniformly with cyclophosphamide followed by
total body irradiation. Control subjects were matched on
sex, underlying diagnosis, age, type of transplantation and
cytomegalovirus (CMV)-serostatus. Sixty-one patients
(16.5%) developed pulmonary complications. Twenty￾one patients (5.7%) developed infectious pneumonia.
Forty patients developed non-infectious complications
which were further subclassified as bronchiolitis obliterans
(3.5%), bronchiolitis obliterans-organizing pneumonia
(0.5%), diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (0.8%), idiopathic
pneumonia syndrome (5.5%) or mixed etiology (0.5%).
Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) Xgrade II was
significantly more common in pulmonary patients than in
the controls (36/61 versus 22/61 patients, P ¼ 0.02). There
was no significant difference in the incidence of chronic
GVHD (P ¼ 0.09). CMV reactivation was significantly
more frequent in patients withlung injury (P ¼ 0.02).
Median survival was 41 weeks for the pulmonary patients
and 350 weeks for the controls (P ¼ 0.001). Altogether,
the incidence of pulmonary complications is low after
T-cell-depleted SCT and is associated withacute GVHD
and CMV reactivation.

Introduction
Pulmonary complications significantly contribute to treat￾ment-related morbidity and mortality after allogeneic stem
cell transplantation (SCT). Whereas infectious diseases of
the lung predominated in previous years, the increased use of
prophylactic antibiotics has shifted the spectrum towards
non-infectious causes. Traditionally, pulmonary toxicities
were observed to range from 30to 50%,1–3 but more recent
studies report a diverse and generally lower incidence.4–14
Unfortunately, these trials did not apply a uniform
definition of non-infectious pulmonary complications. The
best-characterized early onset lung injury after SCT is
diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), whereas bronchiolitis
obliterans (BO) and bronchiolitis obliterans-organizing
pneumonia (BOOP) occur later in the post transplant
period. The most common complication is the idiopathic
pneumonia syndrome (IPS), which is defined as evidence
of widespread alveolar injury in the absence of lower
respiratory tract infection15 and may develop in the early
but more commonly in a later setting. Additional, less
frequently encountered forms of pulmonary toxicity are the
periengraftment respiratory distress syndrome and delayed
pulmonary toxicity syndrome.
Among the variables analyzed for their possible influence
on the development of pulmonary complications, graft￾versus-host disease (GVHD) emerges as a consistent risk
factor,9,16,17 suggesting a role for inflammatory mediators
and alloreactive donor lymphocytes. However, experimen￾tal data have not yet been able to show a mechanistic
relationship.18 Moreover, the association with GVHD
varies among the different types of lung injury. Whereas
BO and BOOP occur almost exclusively in patients with
chronic GVHD,11,19,20 GVHD is among the many risk
factors but not a prerequisite for the development of IPS.21
The pathogenesis of DAH is unclear but it is usually
diagnosed early post transplant and GVHD has not been
identified as a critical factor.22
In the current study, we characterize the spectrum and
incidence of pulmonary toxicities in a large cohort of
patients uniformly treated with cyclophosphamide and
total body irradiation (TBI) followed by a partially T-cell￾depleted SCT and we analyze the relationship between this
lung injury and GVHD.

Patients and methods
Study group
Pulmonary complications were reviewed in a computerized
database of 369 consecutive patients who received either
allogeneic bone marrow (allo-BMT) or peripheral blood
SCTs (allo-PBSCTs) between January 1993 and July
2003 at our institution. Control subjects were selected from
the same database. Controls were matched to each
pulmonary case on sex, underlying diagnosis, age, type of
transplantation (sib or matched-unrelated donor (MUD)),
BMT or PBSCT and cytomegalovirus (CMV)-serostatus to
the best possible extent. Patients who underwent previous
allogeneic or autologous SCT were excluded from the
analysis.
Transplantation procedure
Patients were treated according to clinical protocols
approved by the local investigation review board after
informed consent was obtained. For all patients, the
conditioning myeloablative regimen consisted of cyclophos￾phamide (60mg/kg/day for 2 days) followed by TBI
(600 cGy/day for 2 days) with partial shielding of the lungs
(total lung dose 850cGy). The graft was partially T-cell￾depleted23 consisting of 1–2  105T cells/kg and was
infused after the second TBI fraction (day 0). CD34 dose
was only measured for PBSCT and the median dose was
1.2  106
/kg. Antithymocyte globulin (Thymoglobulin,
Sangstat, Amstelveen, The Netherlands) was given to
MUD patients before cyclophosphamide was infused, at a
total dose of 20mg/kg until April 1999 and 8 mg/kg
thereafter.
Post transplant immunosuppression consisted of cyclo￾sporine, which was discontinued within 3 months after
transplantation when no active GVHD was present.
GVHD was diagnosed according to the Seattle criteria24
and treated with 1–2 mg/kg/day prednisolone and resump￾tion of full dose cyclosporine if applicable. Donor
lymphocyte infusions were administered in case of residual
disease or relapse at a dose of 0.01–1.0  108T cells/kg
to eight patients with pulmonary disease and to 20
controls.
Infection prevention consisted of ciprofloxacin, flucona￾zole plus amphotericin B until granulocyte counts exceeded
500 cells/ml. Cephalothin was given for 10days from day
þ 3. Furthermore, co-trimoxazole and (val)acyclovir were
given orally from day þ 1 until 12 months post transplant￾ation or longer in the case of active GVHD, in a dose of 480
and 500 mg b.i.d., respectively. CMV-seropositive patient/
donor combinations were monitored twice a week during
the first 120 days post transplant. Until April 2001, CMV
monitoring was based on pp65 antigenemia. Since then
CMV viral load was determined by a CMV DNA PCR
technique. Pre-emptive treatment with ganciclovir was
started when tests became positive.
Pulmonary complications
The established etiologies of the pulmonary disease were
reviewed by two of the authors (CH and LFV) on the basis
of clinical, radiological, microbiologic and histological
findings. Pneumonia was classified as infectious based on
the pathogen reported. According to distinguishing features
described previously,21 non-infectious complications were
defined as BO (absence of fever and pulmonary infiltrates,
presence of airway obstruction), BOOP (fever, patchy
pulmonary consolidation and typical histology), DAH
(diffuse pulmonary infiltrates and progressively bloodier
aliquots of lavage return and/or X20% hemosiderin-laden
macrophages during bronchoscopy) and IPS (evidence
of widespread alveolar injury in the absence of lower
respiratory tract infection15). Uncomplicated upper airway
infections or exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmo￾nary disease were excluded from analysis.
Baseline pulmonary function tests were not obtained in
all patients. Post transplant pulmonary function tests
were performed in patients presenting with pulmonary
complaints. Imaging studies (CT-scan and/or X-ray of the
chest) as well as cultures and viral screening of sputum and
blood were performed on all patients presenting with
fever, cough, dyspnea and/or pulmonary infiltrates post
transplant. From October 1997 to March 2001, routine
nasopharyngeal and throat swabs were analyzed by PCR
for the detection of respiratory viruses (adenovirus,
parainfluenza virus, RS virus, influenza virus, rhinovirus,
coronavirus, enterovirus), as described previously.25,26
Treatment was initiated with broad-spectrum antibiotics
given intravenously in case of neutropenia, and amphoteri￾cin was added if the patient remained febrile. Fiber-optic
bronchoscopy with sampling of bronchoalveolar lavage
(BAL) fluid was performed whenever possible if patients
did not respond to empirical antibiotic therapy. Histologi￾cal biopsies were taken according to the clinical situation
and the condition of the patient.
Statistical methods
Differences between the groups were compared by logistic
regression, accounting for the matching used in the control
selection. This model included the variables of interest as
well as the covariates considered a priori to be potential
confounders (sex, underlying diagnosis, age, type of
transplantation and CMV-serostatus). The prevalence of
chronic GVHD could be calculated for patients surviving
4100 days. The difference between patients with infectious
and non-infectious causes of lung injury was compared by
the Pearson w2 test. Overall survival was estimated by
Cox proportional hazard analysis. Odds ratios (ORs) and
their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. For
all tests, a two-sided P-value of p0.05 was considered
statistically significant. Calculations were performed using
SPSS/PC þ 12.0(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Characterization of patients and pulmonary complications
Of the 369 patients reviewed in our study, 61 (16.5%)
developed pulmonary complications after allogeneic SCT.

and their control subjects are shown in Table 1. A minority
of the pulmonary diseases was represented by infectious

causes (21 patients). In four cases, the clinical course
was fully compatible with infectious pneumonia but the
pathogen could not be determined. Forty patients deve￾loped non-infectious complications. These were further
subclassified as BO (13 patients), BOOP (two patients),
DAH (three patients) or IPS (20patients). Bronchoscopy
with BAL was performed in 71% of patients classified as
IPS, yielding negative culture results. A mixed etiology was
established in two patients (Table 2). The pulmonary
complications were diagnosed at a median of 22 weeks after
transplantation (range 2–263 weeks). The median time of
onset did not differ between patients with infectious
problems and those with IPS (19 and 18 weeks, respec￾tively), whereas BO occurred at a later stage (median 28
weeks).
Clinical course and outcome
Table 3 shows the prevalence and severity of acute and
chronic GVHD in the group of pulmonary patients and the
controls. As a consequence of the T-cell-depleted allograft￾ing, the numbers of grades III and IV GVHD were very
small. Overall, the incidence of acute GVHD Xgrade II
was significantly higher among patients with pulmonary
complications (P ¼ 0.02). In this group, no difference was
seen between patients with infectious and non-infectious
causes of lung injury (P ¼ 0.15). The prevalence of chronic
GVHD did not differ significantly between the groups,
although there was a tendency towards a higher overall
incidence in pulmonary patients (P ¼ 0.09 for limited and
extensive chronic GVHD). The ORs for acute and chronic
GVHD were 2.5 (95% CI, 1.2–5.3) and 2.0(95% CI, 0.89–
4.7), respectively. None of the other variables assessed
in the logistic regression model could be identified as
correlated factors. However, CMV reactivation was sig￾nificantly more frequent among patients with pulmonary
complications (P ¼ 0.02, OR 3.4, 95% CI, 1.2–9.5).
In 19 patients, pulmonary complications occurred during
the period when all viral upper and lower respiratory tract
infections were monitored. Viral airway infections were
detected in 12 patients but the upper respiratory tract
infection preceded subsequent lung injury (BO) in only one
patient. Table 1 Characteristics of pulmonary patients and controls

Overall, 14 pulmonary patients were alive at the time of
analysis. Forty-seven patients died, mainly (42 patients)
owing to pulmonary complications. Of the control subjects,
32 were alive and 29 died. Median survival was 41 weeks
(range 4–583 weeks) for the pulmonary patients and 350
weeks (range 8–582 weeks) for the control subjects
(P ¼ 0.001), after a median follow-up of 41 and 175 weeks,
respectively. Survival was similar in patients with infectious
causes and those with IPS (median 34 weeks, range 4–484
and 6–585 weeks, respectively), whereas patients with BO
had a better outcome (median 55 weeks, range 28–410
weeks).
Discussion
Our data confirm that partial T-cell depletion results in a
low incidence of GVHD and pulmonary complications, in
contrast to results of recent studies without T-cell deple￾tion.5,6,8,11,12 In our study, pulmonary complications were
significantly associated with acute GVHD Xgrade II and
CMV reactivation. The increased risk of pulmonary
problems that we found among patients with chronic
GVHD was not statistically significant. This is probably
due to the use of partially T-cell-depleted grafts, resulting in
a much lower incidence of chronic GHVD than reported in
two studies which did demonstrate a relationship between
chronic GVHD and late non-infectious pulmonary com￾plications.11,12 Moreover, in a subset of patients presenting
between 1997 and 2001, we could not identify viral
respiratory tract infections as a risk factor for progression
to lung injury.
The suggestion that non-infectious pulmonary complica￾tions after SCT are associated with GVHD initially came
from the observation that their incidence was lower after
autologous than after allogeneic SCT.27,28 In line with these
findings, T-cell depletion lowered the incidence of both
GVHD and lung injury.8,29 The association between
chronic GVHD and BO is well accepted, mainly on the
basis of consistent epidemiological data.20,30–33 However,
experimental and epidemiological data on the role of
GVHD in the development of IPS are more contradictory,
underlining the lack of a clear mechanistic basis. Epithelial
cell apoptosis, the classical GVHD histopathology finding,
is not a consistent finding in IPS.34,35 However, as Cooke
et al.36 pointed out, epithelial cell apoptosis is not a
requirement of GVHD pathology, and lung biopsies may
be difficult to interpret because of nonspecific changes
occurring, for example, during mechanical ventilation and
suboptimal biopsy specimens owing to the risks associated
with the procedure.
Experimental models have identified a role for alloreac￾tive T cells as well as inflammatory mediators and antigen￾presenting cells in the pathogenesis of IPS, as recently
reviewed.18 More specifically, expression of the chemokine
ligand RANTES by donor T cells contributes to leukocyte
recruitment to the lung.37 Interestingly, it has been
observed in a murine model that T-cell depletion of the
allograft significantly reduced but did not eliminate
pulmonary toxicity.36 Mature donor T cells were signifi￾cantly increased in the BAL fluid of mice that received
allogeneic T cells as compared to syngeneic controls even in
the absence of GVHD, giving weight to the theory that host
reactive donor T cells play a central role rather than
GVHD per se. In addition, in an allogeneic study using a
low T-cell dose (0.2–1.0  105
/kg), 6.4% of patients died of
IPS, while none of them developed significant GVHD.13
Yet novel insights come from the growing experience
with non-myeloablative SCT. Recently, it was shown in a
group of 53 patients that the rate of non-infectious
pulmonary toxicity was low after non-myeloablative
conditioning without irradiation: infectious pneumonia
occurred in nine patients, two patients developed IPS and
no cases of DAH or BO were encountered.10 The overall
incidences of acute GVHD grade I/II, grade III/IV and
extensive chronic GVHD were 19, 19 and 11%, respec￾tively. Another report demonstrated that reduced-intensity
conditioning decreased the incidence of BO, whereas
chronic GVHD was not a risk factor.38 Moreover, non￾myeloablative patients experienced a significantly lower
rate of lung function decline after SCT than myeloablative
patients.39 Both the intensity of the conditioning regimen
(conventional versus non-myeloablative) and the occur￾rence of severe acute GVHD (grades III–IV) were prog￾nostic for the development of IPS in a multiple regression
analysis.7 In our large cohort, patients with pulmonary
complications and controls were comparable with respect
to well-known risk factors for lung injury, and acute
GVHD Xgrade II was significantly related with pulmonary
toxicity. There was no difference in the incidence of acute
GVHD between patients with infectious and those with
non-infectious pulmonary complications. We could not
identify viral respiratory tract infections as a risk factor for
progression to lung injury. Interestingly, we noted an
association between pulmonary complications and CMV
reactivation, which is not among previously reported risk
factors. Therefore, the role of CMV reactivation and the
effect of prophylaxis or pre-emptive therapy on the
development of pulmonary complications deserve further
evaluation.
This study has several limitations. Owing to the retro￾spective nature of this study, we might have missed a single
patient with pulmonary problems, in spite of our detailed
computerized database and extensive chart review. More￾over, we cannot rule out any undetermined relevant
differences between the cases and controls for which we
did not match. Nevertheless, our focus was to assess the
influence of GVHD on the development of pulmonary
diseases. These data illustrate that the incidence of
pulmonary complications is low after partial T-cell￾depleted SCT and demonstrate a clear association with
acute GVHD. Still, improvement of the poor outcome of
pulmonary complications is of utmost importance.
