Background: The genetic background of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) treated with 
alcohol septal ablation (ASA) and its relationship to the outcomes are not known. We aimed to investigate 
whether the outcome of genotype positive (G+) patients differs from genotype negative (G−) patients treated 
with ASA.
Methods: We included 129 HCM patients (mean age 54±13 years) treated with ASA in a tertiary 
cardiovascular center and performed next generation sequencing (NGS) based genomic testing. All patients 
were followed-up three months after the procedure and yearly thereafter. 
Results: A total of 30 (23%) HCM patients were G+ patients. At the 3-months follow-up, both groups 
of patients had similar left ventricular outflow tract PG (16.9±15.7 mmHg in G+ vs. 16.3±18.8 mmHg 
in G−, P=0.73) and symptoms (follow-up NYHA class 1.40±0.62 vs. 1.37±0.53, P=0.99, follow-up CCS 
class 0.23±0.52 vs. 0.36±0.65, P=0.36). The independent predictors of all-cause mortality were baseline 
interventricular septum (IVS) thickness (HR 1.12, 95% CI: 1.00–1.26, P=0.049) and age at the time of ASA 
(HR 1.11, 95% CI: 1.06–1.17, P<0.01). The adjusted all-cause mortality rate did not differ significantly 
between G+ and G− patients (P=0.52). The adjusted combined mortality event rate did not differ between 
both groups (P=0.78).
Conclusions: Despite more severe phenotype in G+ HCM patients, ASA is an equally effective treatment 
for LVOTO in G+ patients as it is for treating LVOTO in G− patients. The long-term outcome after ASA is 
similar in G+ and G− patients.

Introduction
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a heterogeneous 
condition in both its genetic origin and phenotypic 
features (1). Two-thirds of HCM patients have left 
ventricular (LV) outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) 
(2,3). Alcohol septal ablation (ASA) is a safe and effective 
method of treating LVOTO (4,5). The genetic background 
of patients treated by ASA and its possible relationship 
with the outcomes of the procedure are not known. The 
aim of this study was to investigate whether the outcome 
of genotype positive (G+) patients differs from genotype 
negative (G−) patients in a highly symptomatic group of 
HCM patients treated with ASA.
Methods 
Study population 
We included 129 consecutive unrelated patients with a 
clinical diagnosis of HCM in a single tertiary cardiovascular 
center. The patients were treated with ASA between 
1998 and 2017. An HCM diagnosis was established by 
experienced cardiologists based on a clinical examination, 
electrocardiography (ECG), and findings of LV hypertrophy 
≥15 mm on echocardiography and/or magnetic resonance 
imaging (2,3). Secondary hypertrophy attributable to 
aortic valve stenosis or amyloidosis was excluded. When 
patients presented with mild concomitant systemic 
hypertension, the HCM echocardiography specialists had 
to claim the hypertension to be either controlled or the 
severity insufficient to cause the degree of LV hypertrophy. 
Symptomatic patients [New York Heart Association 
(NYHA) class III–IV or syncope on exertion] with 
significant LVOTO (maximal gradient at rest or during 
physiological provocation ≥50 mmHg), despite maximal 
tolerated pharmacotherapy, were offered septal reduction 
therapy. ASA was indicated after a careful assessment by a 
multidisciplinary heart team, in addition to local experience 
with ASA, and the patient’s preference. All ASA procedures 
were performed by a single operator as previously described 
(6-8), and all procedures were guided by myocardial 
contrast echocardiography. A temporary pacemaker lead was 
placed in the right ventricle in all patients without previous 
permanent pacemaker implantation. Patients were observed 
in the coronary care unit for at least 48 hours, and the 
temporary pacemaker lead was then removed if no episode 
of high-degree atrioventricular block occurred. All the 
patients remained on continuous ECG monitoring for up 
to seven days until discharge. Basic demographic, clinical, 
and echocardiographic data were collected at baseline, 
and the patients were followed up three months after the 
ASA procedure and yearly thereafter. The study protocol 
conforms to the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of 
Helsinki (2000, Fifth revision) and was approved by the 
institutional ethical committee. Written informed consent 
was obtained from all patients.
Genetic testing
The DNA samples for next generation sequencing (NGS) 
testing were obtained between 2005 and 2017. Genetic 
testing was performed in all patients treated with ASA 
who provided written informed consent. Genomic DNA 
was isolated from whole blood of all included patients. 
Our targeted NGS enrichment panel and methods of 
variant identification, prioritization, and classification were 
described in detail in our previous paper (9). All identified 
variants were classified according to the American College 
of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and the 
Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) guidelines (10). 
Patients, whose variants were classified as pathogenic or 
likely pathogenic (P/LP), were marked as genotype positive 
(G+ patients). The rest of the cohort, including patients 
with variants of unknown significance, was considered 
genotype negative (G− patients).
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) 
for continuous variables and proportions for categorical 
variables. The Student’s t-test, Mann-Whitney test, and 
Fisher’s exact test were used where appropriate. Cox 
proportional hazards regression was used to identify 
predictors of mortality events. The following clinical and 
echocardiographic variables with potential impact on 
mortality events were first evaluated in a univariate model: 
age at the time of ASA, sex, LVOTO, interventricular 
septum (IVS) thickness, and left atrial diameter. Variables 
with P values <0.15 were then entered into a multivariable 
analysis, which was performed using backward stepwise 
Cox regression. The long-term occurrence of mortality was 
estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences 
between groups were assessed by the log-rank test. Kaplan￾Meier curves of G+ and G− patients were adjusted for age 
at the time of ASA and baseline IVS. The level of statistical 
significance was set to 0.05. The Prism v.8.1.1 (GraphPad

Software Inc., USA) statistical software was used for 
statistical analysis.
Results
The baseline characteristics of all 129 patients are shown 
in Table 1. In 53 (41%) HCM patients, we identified 68 
genetic variants in 25 different genes. The complete list of 
genes is shown in Table S1. Thirty of these variants (localized 
in 8 genes) identified in 30 (23%) HCM patients were 
classified as P/LP. The distribution of genetic variants is 
shown in Figure 1, and patients sorted by classified variants 
are shown in Table 2. Variants were identified in two major 
genes, MYBPC3 and MYH7, wherein the dominant role 
of MYBPC3 was even more apparent in the group of P/LP 
genetic variants (62% of identified variants). 
Compared to G− patients, G+ patients were treated 
with ASA at a younger age (47.3±12.3 vs. 58.8±11.3 years, 
P<0.01), had greater hypertrophy of the IVS (23.9±5.0 
vs. 20.3±3.6 mm, P<0.01), and a smaller LV end-diastolic 
diameter (40.1±4.9 vs. 43.6±4.6 mm, P<0.01).
At baseline, both groups had similar maximal LVOT 
pressure gradients (PG) (63.6±31.4 vs. 63.5±40.2 mmHg, 
P=0.50) and symptoms (NYHA class 2.77±0.57 vs.
2.81±0.49, P=0.81; Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) 
class 1.93±1.17 vs. 1.83±1.04, P=0.45). 
At the three-month follow-up, both groups of patients 
had similar maximal LVOT PG (16.9±15.7 mmHg in 
the G+ group vs. 16.3±18.8 mmHg in the G− group, 
P=0.73) and symptoms (follow-up NYHA class 1.40±0.62 
vs. 1.37±0.53, P=0.99, follow-up CCS class 0.23±0.52 vs.
0.36±0.65, P=0.36).
Early adverse events
None of the patients died or suffered a stroke within 30 
days after the procedure. Sustained ventricular tachycardia/
ventricular fibrillation requiring urgent electrical 
cardioversion during the hospital stay occurred in 5 patients 
(4%). Either transient or persistent complete heart block 
was documented in 22 patients (17%), and a new permanent 
pacemaker was implanted in 9 patients (7%) during the 
hospital stay. Access site complication occurred in 2 patients 
(2%). There were no significant differences in complication 
rate within 30 days between G+ and G− patients (Table 3). 
Long-term survival
The median (interquartile range) follow-up in the survival 
analysis was 9.1 (6.3–12.9) years. The mean follow-up in 
the survival analysis was 9.9±4.8 years. A total of 21 patients 
(16.3%) died during 1,211 patient-years of follow-up, 
which resulted in an all-cause mortality rate of 1.7 deaths 
per 100 patient-years. In the G+ group, 2 (6.7%) of 30

patients died during follow-up. In the G− group during 
follow-up, 19 (19.2%) of 99 patients died. The unadjusted 
all-cause mortality rate did not differ significantly between 
G+ and G− patients (P=0.087), as shown in Figure 2. The 
independent predictors of all-cause mortality were baseline 
IVS thickness (HR 1.12, 95% CI: 1.00–1.26, P=0.049) 
and age at the time of ASA (HR 1.11, 95% CI: 1.06–1.17, 
P<0.001). The all-cause mortality rate adjusted for age at 
the time of ASA and baseline IVS thickness did not differ 
significantly between the G+ and G− patients (P=0.288), as 
shown in Figure 3. Combined mortality event endpoint [all￾cause mortality and appropriate implantable cardioverter￾defibrillator (ICD) discharge] occurred in 24 patients 
(18.6%) during 1,211 patient-years of follow-up, resulting 
in an event rate of 2.0 per 100 patient-years. The unadjusted 
combined mortality event rate did not differ significantly 
between the G+ and the G− groups (P=0.518), as shown 
in Figure 4. The independent predictors of combined 
mortality event rate were IVS thickness (HR 1.14, 95% CI: 
1.03–1.26, P=0.011) and age at the time of ASA (HR 1.07, 
95% CI: 1.03–1.12, P<0.001). The combined mortality 
event rate adjusted for age at the time of ASA and baseline 
IVS thickness did not differ significantly between G+ and 
G− patients (P=0.777), as shown in Figure 5. 
Discussion
Our study suggests that ASA is an equally effective

patients. This finding is important, regarding the fact, that 
G+ patients are considered to have more severe phenotype 
and worse outcome than G− patients (11,12). To date, the 
reported data about G+ patients included a presentation 
at an earlier age, greater hypertrophy of IVS and smaller 
LV enddiastolic diameter (13-15). Increased risk for the 
combined endpoints of cardiovascular death, nonfatal 
stroke, or progression to NYHA functional class III or IV 
compared to G− HCM patients was also reported (16). 
Recent data from a large Portuguese registry of HCM 
patients suggest a higher risk of sudden cardiac death in 
G+ patients (12). Our patients’ baseline characteristics are 
in line with the previously reported data; G + patients are 
younger at the time of diagnosis, have greater hypertrophy 
of IVS and smaller LV enddiastolic diameter. Surprisingly, 
the severity of the LVOTO was similar between both 
groups in our study. Furthermore, the symptoms (angina 
CCS class, dyspnea NYHA class, syncope) were not 
significantly different at baseline. In both groups, the 
symptoms improved after ASA procedures. This finding

further supports the previously reported data from the 
Euro-ASA registry showing comparable outcomes among 
various subgroups of HCM patients treated with ASA (4). 
Since the residual LVOTO after ASA is known to be 
associated with worse prognosis (17), the favorable results 
in G+ patients are of great importance.
We included highly symptomatic HCM patients with 
significant LVOTO. After ASA, their symptoms greatly 
improved, as it has been already demonstrated by several 
studies (4,5,16,17). It is also known, that more pronounced 
reduction of LVOTO is associated with a lower NYHA 
class during the follow-up (4). This was confirmed by the 
current study, where both groups of patients had very low 
LVOT PG and only mild symptoms during the follow up. 
Severe LVOTO is known to be an independent predictor of 
adverse clinical outcome (18,19). Taking this into account, 
the clinical consequence of ASA is largely important. 
Resulting lower LVOT gradient is associated not only 
with better functional class, but also with better survival 
(18,20,21). The important finding of our current study 
is that HCM patients after ASA gained all these benefits 
irrespective of their genetic background. The possible 
explanation of relatively higher number of syncopes after 
ASA in G− patients could be the fact, that the G− patients 
were on average 11.5 years older than G+ patients and 
had higher incidence of complete heart block after ASA, 
as shown in Table 3. Nevertheless, most of the complete 
heart blocks were transient and did not require permanent 
pacemaker implantation.
The long-term survival was not statistically different 
between G+ and G− patients. Neither differed the 
occurrence of combined mortality endpoint (all-cause 
mortality and appropriate ICD discharge). Despite the 
long follow-up, the number of endpoints is relatively low, 
emphasizing the favorable prognosis of post-ASA patients. 
Prediction of post-ASA clinical outcome is challenging 
because of the marked heterogeneity of the treated HCM 
cohort. In our study, the independent predictors of all￾cause mortality were baseline IVS thickness and age at the 
time of ASA. Patients in the G+ group were on average 11.5 
years younger than G− patients. Despite their greater IVS 
thickness at baseline, their mortality rate was lower than in 
G− patients, that is probably attributed to lower age. The 
genotype positivity was not found to be independent of 
these two main predictors. Nevertheless, the low number of 
endpoints in the G+ group compromised the multivariate 
analysis.
Another important finding is that the genetic 
background of HCM patients did not influence the safety 
of the procedure. None of our study patients died or 
suffered a stroke within 30 days after ASA. Despite the 
greater hypertrophy of IVS, the occurrence of malignant 
arrhythmias and cardiopulmonary resuscitation in G+ 
patients were similar to G− patients. The G− patients 
inclined towards higher rates of a complete heart block 
after ASA, but the difference was not statistically significant.
Neither the rates of permanent pacemaker implantation 
differed between our two groups.
Marked genetic heterogeneity of HCM, including 
incomplete penetrance, variable expressivity and existence 
of HCM phenocopies, makes the genotype results 
interpretation complicated. It is likely, that factors other 
than the sarcomere mutation itself influence clinical 
course and outcomes. These genetic, epigenetic, and 
environmental modifiers play an important role but are not 
yet fully characterized or understood. All of these aspects 
of heterogeneity in HCM have prevented identifying clear 
correlations between genotype and phenotype to date.
In our study, we present the largest ASA cohort evaluated 
with NGS. We identified genetic variants in 41% of 
patients. Only 23% of identified variants were classified 
as pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP). This relatively 
low yield of genetic testing is in line with our recent 
findings (9). Advances in contemporary DNA-sequencing 
methodology make gene-based diagnosis faster and cheaper 
in clinical practice. Screening large numbers of genes 
results in the identification of many genetic variants of 
unknown significance (VUS) (18,19) which are not clinically 
actionable. In our study, we used a strict classification 
ACMG guidelines criteria (10), that explains the lower 
number of patients with P/LP variants than described in the 
past (13,14) but in line with the most recent works (12,20). 
Even with analysis of up to 229 genes, 59% of our patients 
do not carry any genetic variant susceptible of causing 
HCM. Together with a known low yield of genetic testing 
in patients with sigmoid septal morphology (13), these 
findings suggest, that some of the patients, despite having 
significant LVOTO treated with ASA, may not suffer from 
a true monogenic disorder. 
While historically viewed as an autosomal dominant 
inherited heart condition, in patients with negative genetic 
tests, the inheritance pattern and utility of family screening 
are unclear. Recent studies have shown that expanded 
panel for genetic testing offers limited additional sensitivity 
for most patients with HCM (21-23). Also, in our study 
of ASA patients, almost all P/LP variants were found in

sarcomeric genes, with only two exceptions. It is clear, that 
a large proportion of individuals with a clinical diagnosis of 
HCM but without sarcomere gene mutations may exhibit 
a distinct disease process that has a more complex, non￾Mendelian inheritance pattern (24). Their phenotype fulfils 
the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of HCM (2,3) and 
they commonly suffer from typical features of the disease, 
including LVOTO. The results of our study revealed that 
both these groups of patients can be treated effectively with 
ASA resulting in similar clinical outcomes. Therefore, the 
decision about ASA procedure should not be influenced by 
genetic background in clinical practice.
Our study has several limitations. It is a retrospective 
analysis of prospectively collected data. The study is 
underpowered in terms of mortality, since our study groups 
are relatively small. We cannot be confident that these 
data are generalizable for non-tertiary referral centers with 
less experience with HCM patients and ASA. Institutional 
experience is a key determinant of successful outcomes 
and lower complication rates of ASA (25). This fact 
results in another selection bias—patients were carefully 
selected for ASA, considering the presence of septal and 
mitral apparatus anatomy appropriate for the procedure. 
Moreover, the results are only applicable to the adult HCM 
population, since no pediatric patients were included in our 
study. 
Conclusions
Despite a more severe phenotype in G+ HCM patients, 
ASA is an equally effective treatment for LVOTO in G+ 
patients as it is for treating LVOTO in G− patients. The 
long-term outcome after ASA is similar in G+ and G− 
patients.
