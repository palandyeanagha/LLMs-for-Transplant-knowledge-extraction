Abstract
Background: The aim of this study was to compare peak oxygen consumption (VO2), heart 
rate (HR) reserve and HR recovery in early and late heart transplant recipients. Moreover, we 
also aimed to correlate peak VO2 and HR reserve.
Methods: Fivteen heart transplant recipients (8 early and 7 late), 8 ± 3 and 161 ± 58 months 
after transplantation, respectively, performed a cardiopulmonary exercise test. 
Results: Early heart transplant recipients showed lower HR reserve compared to late heart trans￾plant recipients, 39 ± 15 vs. 58 ± 19 bpm (p = 0.049), respectively. Peak VO2 (23.4 ± 4 vs. 21.8 ± 
± 5 mL/kg/min, p = 0.56), VO2 respiratory compensation point (18.7 ± 2 vs. 18.5 ± 4 mL/
/kg/min, p = 0.48) and time of exercise testing (14 ± 3 vs. 13 ± 3 min, p = 0.95) %age-
-predicted peakVO2 (65 ± 12 vs. 70 ± 10%, p = 0.24) were not different between the groups. 
Moreover, peak VO2 and %age-predicted peakVO2 correlated with HR reserve only in early heart 
transplant recipients (r = 0.89, p = 0.003 and r = 0.71, p = 0.04, respectively). Early heart 
transplant recipients increased HR (2.5 ± 2.0% at fi rst minute and 0.7 ± 2.3% at the second 
minute), while late recipients decreased HR (–6.0 ± 4.7 at fi rst minute and –15.5 ± 2.4 at the 
second minute) at the recovery period of cardiopulmonary exercise test. 
Conclusions: Exercise capacity did not show difference between early and late heart trans￾plant recipients. HR reserve was higher in late compared to early recipients. HR reserve only 
correlated with peak VO2 in early recipients. Moreover, only late heart transplant recipients 
showed decrease in HR during the recovery period of cardiopulmonary exercise test. (Cardiol J

Introduction
Heart transplantation is worldwide recognized 
as treatment for end stage of patients with heart 
failure. Despite of heart transplant recipients show 
increased exercise capacity when compared to pre-
-transplantation, it is not restored to normal values 
considering age-matched health subjects [1].
Too much effort is taken by the scientific 
community to explain the cardiac and non-cardiac 
causes of impaired exercise capacity in heart 
transplant recipients. Diastolic dysfunction [2], 
chronotropic incompetence, and pre-transplant 
physical deconditioning [3] have been suggested. 
It has also been suggested that exercise capacity 
can increase over the time after heart transplant as

a consequence of cardiac reinnervation [4]. How￾ever no study is available comparing early and late 
heart transplant recipients.
Considering that cardiac reinnervation is rela￾ted to exercise capacity and both can increase along 
the time after transplantation, the aim of this study 
was to compare peak oxygen consumption (VO2), 
heart rate (HR) reserve and HR recovery in early 
and late heart transplant recipients.
Methods
Study population
A total of 15 heart transplant recipients 
(8 early and 7 late) in a stable condition (for, at least, 
3 months), were recruited from a tertiary cardio￾logy hospital from September 2010 to April 2011 
to perform a cardiopulmonary exercise test. Early 
heart transplant was considered less than 1 year 
of surgery and late transplant after 10 years. En￾domyocardial biopsy did not show any evidence of 
tissue rejection during the entire study. Patients 
performed echocardiography before the protocol to 
assure that they did not have diastolic dysfunction 
(E/E’ ratio < 8). Subjects’ characteristics are listed 
in Table 1.
Patients with diastolic dysfunction, noncardio￾vascular functional limitations such as osteoarthri￾tis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were 
excluded from this study. Patients with diastolic 
dysfunction were also excluded.
This protocol was approved by the Ethical 
Committee of our institution. All patients provided 
informed consent prior to participation.
Study design
This cross-sectional study was designed to eva￾luate exercise capacity and HR reserve in early and late 
heart transplant recipients. All patients performed 
a cardiopulmonary exercise test to evaluate HR re￾serve and submaximal-maximal exercise capacity.
Cardiopulmonary exercise test
All patients were asked to refrain from both 
strenuous physical activity and the consumption of 
any stimulants (e.g., coffee, tobacco, alcohol) for 
24 h prior to the cardiopulmonary exercise test. 
Patients’ last meal was ingested at least 2 h before 
the test. Heart transplant recipients underwent the 
test on a programmable treadmill (TMX425 Stress 
Treadmill; TrackMaster, Newton, KS, USA) in 
a temperature-controlled room (21–23°C) between

10–12am with a standard 12-lead continuous ECG 
monitor (CardioSoft 6.5; GE Medical Systems IT, 
Milwaukee, WI, USA) Blood pressure monitoring 
was performed by an automatic device. Resting 
HR was considered the 20-min average in a supine 
position. Minute ventilation, oxygen uptake, carbon 
dioxide output and other cardiopulmonary variables 
were acquired breath-by-breath by a computerized 
system (Vmax Encore29; SensorMedics, Yorba 
Linda, CA, USA).
Metabolic data were computed as the mean of 
the fi nal 30 s of the resting period, whereas peak of 
VO2 and peak HR were the mean values of the fi nal 
30 s of effort before exhaustion. The respiratory 
exchange ratios were recorded as the averaged 
samples obtained during each stage of a modifi ed 
Naughton protocol. A satisfactory cardiopulmo￾nary exercise test was characterized by a peak of 
respiratory exchange ratio > 1.05 and symptoms 
of maximum effort. HR reserve [bpm] was defi ned 
as maximum HR achieved in the cardiopulmonary 
exercise test — average of 10-min resting HR in 
the supine position. HR recovery was assessed 
during the fi rst and second minutes after cardio￾pulmonary exercise test.
The anaerobic threshold was determined when 
the levels of the ratio between VE/VO2 and the 
oxygen partial end tidal pressure reached minimum 
values before rising. The respiratory compensation 
point was determined when VE/VCO2 reached their 
minimum values before rising and the carbon dioxi￾de partial end-tidal pressure reached its maximum 
level before starting to decrease [5].
Current medication intake
Medication profi le is shown in Table 1. Patients 
took angiotensin conversor enzyme inhibitors, 
losartan and isosorbide 5-mononitrate two times 
per day, one half of the daily dose in the morning 
(9:00am) and the other half at night (9:00pm). 
Diuretics were taken in the morning (9:00am). All 
heart transplant recipients were receiving immu￾nosuppressive therapy two times per day, one half 
of the daily dose in the morning and the other half 
at night. Antihypertensive drugs were taken, most 
of the times, in the morning.
Statistical analysis
The descriptive analysis was presented as 
the mean and standard deviation. Mann-Whitney 
test was used to compare HR and VO2 variables 
between early and late heart transplant recipients. 
Spearman test was used for correlation between 
HR reserve and peak VO2.
Data were analyzed using the Statistical Packa￾ge for Social Sciences for Windows, v 11.5 (SPSS 
Inc, Chicago, IL). Statistical signifi cance was set 
at p < 0.05.
Results
Early heart transplant recipients showed lo￾wer HR reserve compared to late heart transplant 
recipients, 39 ± 15 vs. 58 ± 19 bpm (p = 0.049), 
respectively (Fig. 1). PeakVO2, VO2AT, VO2RCP 
and time of exercise testing were not different 
between the groups (Table 2). Peak VO2 achieved in 
relation to age-predicted peak VO2 [6] did not show 
difference between early and late heart transplant 
recipients either. Moreover, peak VO2 and the peak 
VO2 achieved in relation to age-predicted peak VO2 
correlated with HR reserve only in early heart 
transplant recipients (Figs. 2A, B). No patients 
showed diastolic dysfunction.
Early heart transplant recipients increased HR 
(2.5 ± 2.0% at fi rst minute and 0.7 ± 2.3% at the 
second minute), while late recipients decreased 
HR (–6.0 ± 4.7 at fi rst minute and –15.5 ± 2.4

Discussion
The main fi nd in this study was the absence 
of difference in exercise capacity between early 
and late heart transplant recipients. HR reserve 
was increased in late recipients and exercise ca￾pacity correlated with HR reserve only in early 
heart transplant recipients. Moreover, early he￾art transplant recipients showed increase in HR 
during the recovery period. In the opposite way, 
late heart transplant recipients showed decrease 
in HR during the recovery period, what suggests 
a parasympathetic reinnervation.
During the surgical procedure of heart trans￾plantation, sympathetic nerve fi bers that innervate 
the donor’s heart are sectioned causing a complete 
denervation of the organ. Nevertheless, it has been 
reported that the process of cardiac innervation can 
be partially restored over time [7]. Some factors 
related to the characteristics of the donor and 
recipient in association with factors related to the 
perioperative period can also infl uence the process 
of reinnervation [8].
Exercise capacity has been proposed to 
increase along the years following heart trans￾plantation as a consequence of cardiac reinnerva￾tion. However, our study did not fi nd differences 
in exercise capacity between early and late heart 
transplant recipients. Interestingly, the HR re￾serve was higher in late recipients. We expected 
that exercise capacity would increase in late heart 
transplant recipients due to the reinnervation 
process and to the improvement in cardiovascular 
control. It is well known that exercise capacity 
(in the picture of VO2) is directly infl uenced by 
central (cardiac output or HR × systolic volume) 
and peripheral (a-vO2 difference) components. It 
is also known that, despite of the heart transplant, 
the neurohormonal activity remains overactivated, 
what can badly infl uence the peripheral vasodilation 
and impair muscle function [9, 10].
Taking into account that HR reserve [11] was 
higher in late recipients, what might refl ect the 
reinnervation process, and that HR reserve was 
not correlated to peak VO2 in late heart transplant 
recipients, we hypothesized that peripheral com￾ponents could be playing an important role in the 
low exercise capacity in late recipients. Cardiac 
reinnervation does not seem to be the only com￾ponent involved in exercise capacity over the years 
following heart transplantation, once late recipients 
are also chronically taken immunosuppressive 
drugs that are related to impaired muscle function.
HR recovery in exercise test is a well estab￾lished and straightforward method of assessing 
parasympathetic tone. The low drop of HR at the 
recovery period of exercise test represents a risk 
factor for cardiovascular disease [12]. Our early 
heart transplant recipients showed increase in 
HR during the recovery period, what may refl ect 
the catecholamine pathway of cardiovascular con￾trol. After exercise, the body needs some time 
to “wash” the circulating catecholamine. In the 
opposite way, the late heart transplant recipients 
showed decrease in HR during the recovery period, 
what suggests a parasympathetic reinnervation and 
less dependence of the catecholamine pathway of 
cardiovascular control.
Limitations of the study
This study is limited by the small number of 
patients, however, it represents the larger expe￾rience in Brazil. Moreover, peripheral vasodilation 
and oxygen kinetics were not assessed, what 
could contribute to a deep understanding in the 
peripheral components of exercise capacity in heart 
transplant recipients.
Conclusions
Exercise capacity did not show difference 
between early and late heart transplant recipients. 
HR reserve was higher in late compared to early 
recipients. Only late heart transplant recipients 
showed decrease in HR during the recovery period 
of cardiopulmonary exercise test. Moreover, HR 
reserve only correlated with peak VO2 in early 
recipients, what fi gures that peripheral compo￾nents could be playing an important role in the 
low exercise capacity in late recipients.
