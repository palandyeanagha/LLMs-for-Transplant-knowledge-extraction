Background: Cancer of the uterine cervix is a common cause of mortality in women. After initial 
treatment women may be symptom free, but the cancer may recur within a few years. It is uncertain 
whether it is more clinically effective to survey asymptomatic women for signs of recurrence or to await 
symptoms or signs before using imaging.
Objectives: This project compared the diagnostic accuracy of imaging using positron emission 
tomography/computerised tomography (PET-CT) with that of imaging using CT or magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) alone and evaluated the cost-effectiveness of adding PET-CT as an adjunct to 
standard practice.
Data sources: Standard systematic review methods were used to obtain and evaluate relevant test 
accuracy and effectiveness studies. Databases searched included MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index 
and The Cochrane Library. All databases were searched from inception to May 2010.
Review methods: Study quality was assessed using appropriately modified Quality Assessment of 
Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) criteria. Included were any studies of PET-CT, MRI or CT compared 
with the reference standard of histopathological findings or clinical follow-up in symptomatic women 
suspected of having recurrent or persistent cervical cancer and in asymptomatic women a minimum of 
3 months after completion of primary treatment. Subjective elicitation of expert opinion was used to 
supplement diagnostic information needed for the economic evaluation. The effectiveness of treatment 
with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, chemoradiotherapy, radical hysterectomy and pelvic exenteration was

systematically reviewed. Meta-analysis was carried out in RevMan 5.1 (The Cochrane Collaboration, The 
Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark) and Stata version 11 (StataCorp LP, College Station, 
Texas, USA). A Markov model was developed to compare the relative cost-effectiveness using TreeAge Pro 
software version 2011 (TreeAge Software Inc., Evanston, IL, USA).
Results: For the diagnostic review, a total of 7524 citations were identified, of which 12 test accuracy 
studies were included in the review: six studies evaluated PET-CT, two evaluated MRI, three evaluated CT 
and one evaluated both MRI and CT. All studies were small and the majority evaluated imaging in women 
in whom recurrence was suspected on the basis of symptoms. The PET-CT studies evaluated local and 
distant recurrence and most used methods similar to current practice, whereas five of the six CT and MRI 
studies evaluated local recurrence only and not all employed currently used methods. Meta-analysis of PET￾CT studies gave a sensitivity of 92.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) 85.1% to 96.0%] and a specificity of 
88.1% (95% CI 77.9% to 93.9%). MRI sensitivities and specificities varied between 82% and 100% and 
between 78% and 100%, respectively, and CT sensitivities and specificities varied between 78% and 93% 
and between 0% and 95%, respectively. One small study directly compared PET-CT with older imaging 
methods and showed more true-positives and fewer false-negatives with PET-CT. The subjective elicitation 
from 21 clinical experts gave test accuracy results for asymptomatic and symptomatic women and the 
results for symptomatic women were similar to those from the published literature. Their combined 
opinions also suggested that the mean elicited increase in accuracy from the addition of PET-CT to MRI 
and/or CT was less than the elicited minimum important difference in accuracy required to justify the 
routine addition of PET-CT for the investigation of women after completion of primary treatment. For the 
effectiveness review, a total of 24,943 citations were identified, of which 62 studies were included 
(chemotherapy, 19 randomised controlled trials; radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy, 16 case series; radical 
hysterectomy and pelvic exenteration, 27 case series). None provided the effectiveness of cisplatin 
monotherapy, the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agent in the NHS, compared with supportive 
care in a background of other treatment such as radiotherapy in recurrent and persistent cervical cancer. 
The model results showed that adding PET-CT to the current treatment strategy of clinical examination, 
MRI and/or CT scan was significantly more costly with only a minimal increase in effectiveness, with 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for all models being >£1M per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and 
the additional cost per additional case of recurrence being in the region of £600,000.
Limitations: There was considerable uncertainty in many of the parameters used because of a lack of 
good-quality evidence in recurrent or persistent cervical cancer. The evidence on diagnostic and therapeutic 
impact incorporated in the economic model was poor and there was little information on surveillance of 
asymptomatic women.
Conclusions: Given the current evidence available, the addition of PET-CT to standard practice was not 
found to be cost-effective in the diagnosis of recurrent or persistent cervical cancer. However, although 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the main conclusion about cost-ineffectiveness of PET-CT was 
firm given the range of assumptions made, should more reliable information become available on 
accuracy, therapeutic impact and effectiveness, and the cost of PET-CT reduce, this conclusion may need 
revision. Current guidelines recommending imaging for diagnosis using expensive methods such as PET-CT 
need to be reconsidered in the light of the above.

Chapter 1 Aims of the report
The aims of this project were as follows:
1. To evaluate, through systematic review of the literature, the diagnostic accuracy of adding positron 
emission tomography/computerised tomography (PET-CT) to CT and/or magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) compared with the diagnostic accuracy of CT and/or MRI alone in women with suspected 
recurrent or persistent cervical cancer in identifying local recurrence, regional recurrence and nodal 
and distant metastases.
2. To evaluate, through systematic review of the literature, the diagnostic and therapeutic impact of the 
addition of PET-CT to CT and/or MRI compared with CT and/or MRI alone on recurrent and persistent 
cervical cancer.
3. To assess, through systematic review of the literature, the effectiveness of various interventions and 
combinations of interventions (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy) for 
mortality, morbidity and quality of life in the management of recurrent and persistent cervical cancer.
4. To evaluate, using decision-analytic modelling, including value of information analysis, the cost￾effectiveness of adding PET-CT imaging to CT and/or MRI compared with CT and/or MRI alone, 
and with different follow-up strategies, for the detection and work-up of recurrent and persistent

Chapter 2 Background
Description of the underlying health problem
Cervical cancer is a malignancy originating in the female uterine cervix. Cervical cancer usually originates 
in the transformation zone of the cervix where the squamous epithelial cells of the ectocervix meet 
the columnar epithelium of the endocervix. Approximately 80% of cervical cancers are squamous 
cell carcinomas. This type of cancer originates in the thin, flat squamous cells on the surface of the 
ectocervix, the part of the cervix that is next to the vagina. Another 10% of cervical cancers are of the 
adenocarcinoma type. This cancer originates in the mucus-producing cells of the inner or endocervix, 
near the body of the uterus. Occasionally, the cancer may have characteristics of both types and is called 
adenosquamous carcinoma or mixed carcinoma. Cervical cancers can be locally invasive and also spread 
by metastases. Pelvic recurrence can be central at the cervix or vaginal vault and in the lymph nodes of the 
pelvic side wall. Distant metastases can be to supraclavicular lymph nodes, para-aortic lymph nodes and 
the lungs.
Staging of cervical cancer can use the tumour, node, and metastases parameters (Box 1), but much more 
often uses the Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) criteria1
 (Table 1).
Aetiology
Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection of the cervix is a sexually transmitted infection that is necessary for 
the development of cervical cancer.2
 However, only a relatively small proportion of women who encounter 
persistent infection from high-risk genotypes (HPV 16 and 18, and some other strains) go on to develop 
cervical cancer.3
 When HPV is detected, around 17% of women go on to develop cervical intraepithelial

neoplasia grade II+ within 3 years.2
 HPV infection is very common; it is estimated that 20% of sexually 
active girls will contract the virus by the age of 18 years.4
 The risk of infection increases with the age at first 
sexual intercourse.5
There are a number of factors that can increase or decrease the risk of developing cervical cancer:
z Age. Cervical cancer is rare before the age of 20 years but the incidence increases rapidly with age, 
giving a peak incidence of around 17 per 100,000 between the ages of 30 and 39 years.6
 Cervical 
cancer mortality rates generally increase with age, so that only about 7% of cervical cancer deaths 
occur in women under 35 years, with the highest rates in women over 70 years.7
 Squamous cell 
tumours are more common, but the rates of both squamous cell tumours and adenocarcinomas rise 
sharply from age 20–40 years, after which they plateau until age 80 years.8
z Sexual behaviour. There is an increased risk of invasive cervical cancer with early age at first sexual 
intercourse,5,9 early pregnancy5
 and current use of hormonal contraceptives.10
z Smoking. Current smoking intensity is an independent risk factor for high-grade cervical intraepithelial 
neoplasia in young women, after controlling statistically for cervical HPV infection,11 and may be a risk 
factor for developing cervical cancer.12
z HIV infection. HIV infection leads to an increased risk of advanced and early cervical pathology.13
TABLE 1 Revised FIGO criteria for disease staging
Stage Characteristic
Stage I The carcinoma is strictly confined to the cervix (extension to the uterine corpus would be disregarded)
Stage IA: invasive carcinoma that can be diagnosed only by microscopy, with deepest invasion ≤5mm and 
largest extension ≥7mm
Stage IA1: measured stromal invasion of ≤3mm in depth and extension of ≤7mm
Stage IA2: measured stromal invasion >3mm and not >5mm with an extension of ≤7mm
Stage IB: clinically visible lesions limited to the cervix uteri or preclinical cancers greater than stage IAa
Stage IB1: clinically visible lesion ≤4cm in greatest dimension
Stage 1B2: clinically visible lesions >4cm in greatest dimension
Stage II Cervical carcinoma invades beyond the uterus but not to the pelvic wall or to the lower third of the vagina
Stage IIA: without parametrial invasion
Stage IIA1: clinically visible lesion ≤4cm in greatest dimension
Stage IIA2: clinically visible lesions >4cm in greatest dimension
Stage IIB: with obvious parametrial invasion
Stage III The tumour extends to the pelvic wall and/or involves the lower third of the vagina and/or causes 
hydronephrosis or non-functioning kidneyb
Stage IIIA: tumour involves lower third of the vagina, with no extension onto the pelvic wall
Stage IIIB: extension to the pelvic wall and/or causes hydronephrosis or non-functioning kidney
Stage IV The carcinoma has extended beyond the true pelvis or has involved (biopsy proven) the mucosa of the bladder 
or rectum. A bullous oedema, as such, does not permit a case to be allotted to stage IV
Stage IVA: spread of the growth to adjacent organs
Stage IVB: spread to distant organs
a All macroscopically visible lesions – even with superficial invasion – are allotted to stage IB carcinomas. Invasion is 
limited to a measured stromal invasion with a maximal depth of 5mm and a horizontal extension of ≤7mm. Depth 
of invasion should be ≤5mm taken from the base of the epithelium of the original tissue – superficial or glandular. 
The depth of invasion should always be reported in mm, even in those cases with ‘early (minimal) stromal invasion’ 
(~1mm). The involvement of vascular/lymphatic spaces should not change the stage allotment.
b On rectal examination there is no cancer-free space between the tumour and the pelvic wall. All cases with 
hydronephrosis or non- functioning kidney are included, unless they are known to be due to another cause.

z Socioeconomic status. Women living in the most deprived areas in the UK have cervical cancer rates 
that are more than three times as high as those women in the least deprived areas. Data from a 
longitudinal study, representing 1% of the population from England and Wales, showed that cervical 
cancer incidence is considerably higher among women of working age in manual occupations than 
among women in non-manual occupations.14
Epidemiology
Cervical cancer is a common gynaecological malignancy, with an estimated 31,400 new cases diagnosed 
each year in the European Union.15 In the UK, approximately 2800 patients are diagnosed with cervical 
cancer per year, accounting for around 2% of all female cancer cases.6
 In England, carcinoma of the cervix 
is rare in women <20 years of age.6
 Cancer of the cervix is a leading cause of cancer death in women. In 
2008, there were 1110 deaths from cervical cancer in the UK, giving a European age-standardised death 
rate of 2.7 per 100,000 person-years.15 In the UK population, the 5-year disease-free survival rate for 
treated stage IA disease is almost 100%, whereas it is 50–70% for stage IB2 and IIB, 30–50% for stage III 
and 5–15% for stage IV disease.16 It is estimated that the median survival for stage IVB disease is around 
9–10 months, with 30% of patients surviving 1 year and 2–5% surviving 2 years.17
Initial treatment of cervical cancer
When patients are initially diagnosed with cervical cancer they can be treated with surgery, a combination 
of chemotherapy and radiotherapy (chemoradiotherapy) or with palliative care. The treatment chosen is 
based on stage of tumour, fitness of the woman and tumour characteristics, for example greater than 
one-third stromal invasion, capillary lymphatic space involvement and large tumour diameter.18 Surgery is 
usually radical hysterectomy but can also be trachelectomy (if the tumour is small), which is the removal of 
the cervix only rather than the whole uterus and can be performed in younger women with early cervical 
cancer who wish to retain their fertility.3
 Approximately 20–30% of women undergoing surgery also 
receive adjuvant postoperative chemoradiotherapy for positive tumour margins or positive lymph nodes or 
because of the tumour size, volume, lymphovascular space invasion or stromal invasion.19
Recurrent or persistent cervical cancer
Patients can be cured by initial treatment and approximately 70–80% of initially treated cases are cured 
with surgery. If surgery is not appropriate because of tumour characteristics or lack of fitness in the 
patient, chemoradiotherapy can be given. However, the initial treatment may not affect a cure and in 
approximately 15% of patients disease is detected 3 months after treatment, which is called persistent 
cervical cancer (rather than recurrent). Recurrence is more common within the first 24 months after the 
initial diagnosis, but can happen up to 15 years after initial treatment.20
The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) guideline3
 found the rates of recurrence from the 
three studies reviewed in the guideline to be 13%,21 18.2%22 and 29%.23 In another study, the proportion 
with recurrence in early-stage cervical cancer was 6%;24 a further study of locally advanced cervical cancer 
reported 30% recurrence.25 Recurrences are more common within the first 24 months after the initial 
diagnosis – the median disease-free interval was 17 months for symptomatic patients and 16 months for 
asymptomatic patients in one cohort21 and the median time from surgery to recurrence in another cohort 
was 17.6 months.22 The percentage recurrence was higher after radiotherapy (17%) than after surgery 
(13%),21 but none of the studies compared recurrence after chemoradiotherapy with recurrence after 
surgery. The proportions of asymptomatic to symptomatic recurrences were 19:11421 and 2:5.22
Patients with pelvic recurrence usually present with one or more of vaginal bleeding, discharge, pelvic pain 
and sciatic pain. Patients with disseminated recurrence eventually develop systemic symptoms associated 
with cachexia.
Risk factors for recurrence include disease stage, number of positive lymph nodes, parametrial involvement 
and depth of invasion of the tumour.24 The squamous cell carcinoma antigen is elevated in 28–88% of 
patients with cervical cancer and can precede clinical diagnosis of relapse in 46–92% of cases.26

Background

Patients with recurrence or persistence are described according to the stage they were when they were 
diagnosed originally, along with some further information on whether or not and how much the cancer 
has progressed since the original diagnosis. For example, a woman who presented with a stage IIA cancer 
who now has distant metastases does not become a stage IVB cancer, but is described as a stage IIA 
cancer with metastases. Occasionally, a new stage can be assigned in addition if the cancer has recurred, 
particularly in trials, in which case it will be described with a lower case r in front of the new staging, for 
example stage rIVB.27
Prognosis
Survival with recurrent or persistent disease is poor – from 6 months to 2 years.3
 Also, patients frequently 
experience substantial morbidity from local recurrence and distant spread.3
 It is unclear whether or not 
earlier detection of recurrence (from clinical follow-up or scanning) leads to increased survival rates, but 
this is a reasonable assumption to make. Worse survival is associated with shorter disease-free interval, 
being symptomatic and poorer prognostic factors.28
Imaging to detect recurrence
This project investigates three imaging techniques: CT, MRI and PET-CT. These techniques allow non￾invasive visualisation of anatomical structures and physiological functions of the body.
Computerised tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scanning
Computerised tomography scanning was introduced in the 1970s and is now widely used in the NHS. A 
CT scan is a series of tomographic radiographic images used to visualise two-dimensional ‘slices’ through 
the body. Because the X-ray beam emission and the receiving film-intensifying screen are both revolving 
around a focal point in the body, this focal point can be visualised much more clearly than in a standard 
radiography film. A very large number of focal points are visualised consecutively and then a computer 
is used to mathematically reconstruct a two-dimensional matrix to give a digital image of the part of the 
body being scanned. CT scanning is painless and takes 15–30 minutes. It is non-invasive unless contrast 
medium is being used. For most whole-body CT scans, intravenous iodinated contrast is now used and 
there is the risk of allergic reactions. The main disadvantage, however, is the dose of radiation that is 
absorbed during the scanning. It has been estimated that 40% of all diagnostic radiation exposure in 
patients comes from CT scanning.29 CT scanning can also produce artefacts that impede interpretation of 
the images. These artefacts can come from motion (e.g. patients have to hold their breath when the chest 
is being scanned) and from high-density objects such as tooth fillings and orthopaedic hardware.
Magnetic resonance imaging scanning was introduced in the 1980s and is now also widely used in major 
centres in the NHS. It is also a tomographic imaging technique but uses the ability of hydrogen atoms 
to absorb and emit radio waves (at a similar frequency to FM radio) when placed in a strong magnetic 
field. Visualisation of tissues can occur because of the different concentrations of hydrogen atoms in 
different tissues and the characteristics of the atoms in different complex biochemical environments. MRI 
uses characteristics such as the density of hydrogen atoms, the speed at which they become magnetised 
and lose their magnetisation and the presence of flow or motion in a tissue. MRI does not use ionising 
radiation, which is an advantage compared with CT. However, patients are placed in a magnetic field 
and so metal objects inside and outside the body will be affected. Patients with pacemakers, cochlear 
implants, shotgun fragments, etc. should not have a MRI scan. The energy generated inside the body 
can cause hyperthermia, particularly in obese people. The size of the trolley and aperture (MRI machines 
are longer than CT machines and fit the whole body inside) mean that people who weigh >20 stone 
(127kg) are unlikely to fit inside the machine. The machine is also noisy and a small proportion of patients 
have anxiety-related reactions. MRI scans can give false-positive results from motion artefacts, interfaces 
between fat and water and distortions due to magnetic objects inside the body.

Computerised tomography and MRI are high-resolution anatomical imaging techniques that are commonly 
used in cancer to detect potential tumours. MRI and CT are currently considered first when recurrence 
is suspected.17 Whole-body CT and MRI scanning are now rarely performed; imaging for cervical cancer 
is frequently limited to the pelvis only. CT and MRI have limitations in differentiating recurrent tumours 
from postradiotherapy or surgical fibrosis and also have limitations in accurately identifying the extent of 
recurrence as small volume nodal metastasis. If CT or MRI of the pelvic area only is carried out, distant 
recurrence may not be identified. They can also be unreliable in determining the presence or absence of 
recurrent disease in the pelvis after radiotherapy, as radiotherapy-induced fibrosis makes tissues indurated 
and thus potentially conceals recurrent disease.
Positron emission tomography/computerised tomography scanning
Positron emission tomography is an imaging method that can be used to establish the functional 
parameters of tissue, allowing detection of metabolically active areas in tissues such as tumours.30
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) is the most widely used radiotracer and is intravenously injected 
1–2 hours before imaging. It is a glucose analogue and is taken up and actively trapped in the enhanced 
glycolytic pathway of hypermetabolic areas, demonstrated by high-energy photons emitted as a result 
of annihilation of positrons emitted by the radioisotope, with nearby negatively charged electrons. PET 
provides anatomical image resolution of the order of 4–6mm, significantly better than conventional 
gamma cameras but inferior to the 1- to 2-mm resolution of CT or MRI. The size of lesion that can 
be detected by PET is limited by several factors, including the physics of positron emission, the spatial 
resolution of the scanner (typically 4.5–6.0mm in the centre of the axial field) and the safe dosing limits 
of 18F-FDG.30
Positron emission tomography/computerised tomography is a combination of PET scanning and CT 
scanning on the same machine. It precisely aligns and combines metabolic PET imagines with anatomical 
CT images obtained immediately and consecutively without patient movement, and is being increasingly 
preferred over PET scanning alone as it allows more precise localisation of active disease sites than either 
technology separately. The CT scan usually has a lower radiation dose than standard CT scans and contrast 
media are rarely used. PET-CT in suspected recurrent or persistent cervical cancer can detect metabolically 
active metastatic lesions in normal-sized nodes and in postsurgical or radiotherapy fibrosis. PET-CT in the 
follow-up of cervical cancer patients can be used to identify recurrent or persistent disease, assess local 
tumour extension, evaluate pelvic nodal involvement, detect distant metastases (e.g. lung, supraclavicular 
lymph nodes and para-aortic lymph nodes), plan radiotherapy and assess response to therapy.31
There are several disadvantages to PET-CT scanning. First, the machine is very expensive (approximately 
£2M). Second, 18F-FDG has a short half-life of around 2 hours and therefore can cause throughput 
difficulties. False-positives are relatively common because the technique is looking for metabolically active 
regions and not all are cancerous, for example sepsis and inflammation following surgery and radiotherapy 
may mimic metastases. False-negatives can also occur soon after chemotherapy because the drugs may 
slow the metabolism of the metastases but not eliminate them altogether. Therefore, PET-CT to find 
secondary spread is not recommended within 3 months of surgery and radiotherapy and within 6 weeks 
of chemotherapy.
Current guidelines on imaging strategies in recurrent cervical cancer
The SIGN guidelines3
 state that evidence for the effectiveness of post-treatment surveillance is inconsistent 
and that there is no evidence to suggest that prior radiotherapy or chemotherapy alters the sensitivity of 
detection of recurrence. They suggest that patients should be followed up every 4 months for at least 
2 years. In asymptomatic patients, a PET-CT scan is recommended at 9 months’ follow-up in women who 
have had chemoradiotherapy. If positive, pelvic MRI should be considered for surgical planning if pelvic 
exenteration is appropriate. In symptomatic women, MRI or CT should be considered to assess potential 
clinical recurrence. If positive, a whole-body PET or PET-CT scan should be performed in patients in whom 
salvage therapy (pelvic exenteration or radiotherapy) is being considered.

The Society of Gynecologic Oncologists recommendations state that there is insufficient data to support 
routine use of PET-CT in asymptomatic patients.32 It suggests that CT and/or PET should be used when 
recurrence is suspected at any time up to 5 years after treatment.
The UK Royal College of Radiologists guidelines used evidence that was not specific to recurrent cervical 
cancer.33 However, it suggests that PET-CT can be used for restaging patients with cervix carcinoma 
considered for exenterative surgery, and for suspected recurrence when other imaging is equivocal.
Survival data from positron emission tomography/computerised tomography 
studies in cervical cancer
There are two publications34,35 that contain useful information about survival in cervical carcinoma, 
using PET-CT to differentiate between different groups of patients, including those with persistent and 
recurrent cervical cancer. In Schwartz et al.,
35 92 women who had been treated with chemoradiotherapy 
for carcinoma of the cervix (FIGO stages IB1 to IVA) and who had whole-body PET-CT between 8 and 
16 weeks after initial therapy were followed up clinically for at least 6 months (range 6–49 months). 
PET-CT was used to investigate prognosis, linking findings with progression-free survival and cause-specific 
survival. Among the 92 patients, PET-CT showed a complete response in 65 (71%) and persistent tumour 
in 15 (16%) and identified new abnormalities in 12 (13%). The survival rates are shown in Figure 1. The 
3-year cause-specific rates were 96% for women with a complete response to treatment and 43% for 
patients with persistent disease, and the 2-year survival rate was 14% for patients with any new sites of 
disease. The 3-year progression-free survival rates were 78% for patients with a complete response after 
therapy, 33% for patients with persistent disease and 0% for those with new sites of tumour.
Brooks et al.34 investigated the usefulness of PET-CT imaging in 78 asymptomatic and 25 symptomatic 
patients following a complete response to initial chemoradiotherapy for cervical cancer. The post-therapy 
PET-CT was performed at 3 months after treatment completion and patients were followed up for a 
median of 13 months for asymptomatic patients and 8 months for symptomatic patients. Unfortunately, 
for the first 2 years only PET was used and for the remaining 4 years PET-CT was used. The number 
of women in each group is unclear. The survival curves are shown in Figure 2. The 3-year survival for 
patients with symptomatic recurrence was 19% compared with 59% for patients with asymptomatic 
recurrence (p=0.09).

Treatment options for recurrent cervical cancer
Treatment of recurrent cervical cancer depends on the site (central, pelvic, distant), extent of recurrence, 
type of previous treatment received (surgery, chemoradiotherapy, radiotherapy), time elapsed since primary 
treatment and patient fitness. Treatment intention is usually curative or palliative. Palliative treatment is 
used when there are distant metastases or multiple site recurrences and is usually chemotherapy.
Potentially curative disease is defined as:
z confirmed recurrence of the disease confined to the pelvis, provided that the patient has not received 
previous primary or adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy
z disease confined to the central pelvis, without pelvic side wall or extrapelvic involvement, provided that 
radiotherapy has been administered before recurrence
z distant recurrences at a single site (such as para-aortic lymph node) that could be completely resected 
or encompassed by a curative radiotherapy procedure.
In women with recurrence who had surgery for their primary tumour, radiotherapy is the treatment 
of choice. This may also include chemotherapy, which is often single-agent cisplatin.3
 In women who 
had chemoradiotherapy or radiotherapy and who have persistent cervical cancer, salvage surgery is 
generally considered if the patient is sufficiently fit, if the disease is localised to the pelvis only and if 
surgery has a high chance of completely removing the disease with clear margins.3
 Surgery can be radical 
hysterectomy or pelvic exenteration. Surgery for relapsed disease after radiotherapy is often associated 
with high morbidity as radiation fibrosis makes surgery difficult and, to enhance cure rates, surgical 
excision of disease often involves removal of the bladder, uterus, cervix and various amounts of the 
vagina (anterior exenteration) or the uterus, vagina and portions of the rectosigmoid colon and anus 
(posterior exenteration) or a complete pelvic clearance (exenteration). In a small number of patients, radical 
hysterectomy will suffice if the disease is highly localised. As exenterations are morbid surgical procedures 
resulting in alteration of body image and loss of bladder and/or bowel control, patients require extensive 
preoperative psychosocial counselling.
Objectives of this report
When this project was being defined there was some discussion around the exact focus, because the 
current UK imaging strategy using PET-CT is for selective use in symptomatic patients depending on 
symptoms and equivocal or negative findings on CT and/or MRI and to rule out the possibility of distant

metastases when salvage surgery is being considered, rather than for routine use in all symptomatic 
patients with suspected recurrence and as routine follow-up in asymptomatic patients. In asymptomatic 
patients, clinical follow-up alone may also have been a useful comparator to routine CT, MRI or PET-CT.
This research project was undertaken to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
strategies of imaging with MRI or CT with or without PET-CT in women with asymptomatic or symptomatic 
recurrent cervical cancer, and for their subsequent treatment with surgery, chemotherapy and/or 
radiotherapy. The relationship of our clinical objectives to the range of work required is shown in Figure 3. 
The economic evaluation is in addition to these objectives and is described in Chapter 8.

Chapter 3 Methods for systematic reviews and 
subjective elicitation
Protocol development and overview of review methods
A generic protocol was developed for undertaking the systematic reviews of test accuracy, diagnostic and 
therapeutic yield and effectiveness. Scoping searches for relevant systematic reviews were conducted in 
MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library (see Appendix 2).
Systematic reviews were carried out using established methods in line with the recommendations of 
the NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination36 and the Cochrane Collaboration,37 and, for diagnostic 
systematic reviews, using the latest methods from the Cochrane Diagnostic Test Accuracy Working 
Group.38 Presentation of systematic reviews is according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.39
Inclusion of studies, data extraction and quality assessment were carried out in duplicate with differences 
resolved by consensus and/or arbitration involving a third reviewer. There were no language limitations 
on inclusion criteria. The selection process was piloted by applying the inclusion criteria to a sample 
of papers first, and then a two-stage process was used, first, by screening titles and abstracts. For all 
references categorised as ‘include’ or ‘uncertain’ by both reviewers, the full text was retrieved whenever 
possible and final inclusion decisions were made on the full paper. Reference Manager 12.0 software 
(Thomson ResearchSoft, San Francisco, CA, USA) was used to construct a database of citations for all 
systematic reviews.
Clinical, methodological and statistical data extraction was carried out using data extraction sheets by 
at least two reviewers and discrepancies were resolved through discussion. If consensus could not be 
reached, disagreements were resolved by arbitration by a third reviewer. For diagnostic studies, information 
was extracted regarding study design and methods, characteristics of participants, PET-CT and comparison 
tests, and outcomes of interest (see Appendix 3). For the effectiveness review, separate data extraction 
forms were used for different study designs: comparative experimental study (part A), comparative 
observational study (B) and non-comparative study (C) (see Appendix 4). The quality assessment questions 
for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the data extraction sheet, but a separate form was 
used for case series (see Appendix 5). Data extraction was managed with Microsoft Office 2003 Word 
and Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA). Quality was also assessed independently by two 
reviewers. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion or by arbitration by the third reviewer.
Methods for test accuracy and diagnostic and therapeutic 
impact reviews
Search strategy
A sensitive search was conducted to identify all relevant published and unpublished studies and studies 
in progress. All databases were searched from inception to May 2010. Search strategies were designed 
from a series of test searches and discussions of the results of those searches among the review team. 
Both medical subject heading (MeSH) terms and text words were used and included ‘cervical cancer’, 
‘PET-CT’, ‘CT’ and ‘MRI’. The strategies from MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library can be found in 
Appendix 6. Literature was identified from several sources including:

z general health and biomedical databases: MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), Science Citation Index, The 
Cochrane Library [Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)], Medion
z checking of reference lists of systematic and narrative review articles
z searching a range of relevant databases including ClinicalTrials.gov and the UK Clinical Research 
Network Portfolio to identify information about studies in progress, unpublished research or research 
reported in grey literature
z specialist search gateways (OMNI and the National Cancer Institute), general search engine (Google) 
and meta-search engine (Copernic) from March to May 2010
z hand-searching of Gynecologic Oncology from 1980 to May 2010
z authors of included studies contacted for information on relevant published or unpublished studies.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Population
Included:
z any women with clinical suspicion of persistent or recurrent cervical cancer after primary treatment, 
on the basis of one or more of clinical history, clinical examination and tests (including imaging 
and histology)
z any women who had had advanced-stage cervical cancer (IB2–IV) treated previously, for example 
with chemoradiotherapy, with a minimum gap between completion of treatment and imaging of 
3 months, and who were currently asymptomatic and undergoing routine follow-up.
Excluded:
z studies in which the population contained women within 3 months of completion of treatment 
for primary disease were excluded because of problems associated with distinguishing treatment 
complications and inflammatory response from recurrence in this patient group.
Index test
Included:
z PET-CT using 18F-FDG as the radioisotope tracer.
Excluded:
z PET alone without concurrent CT.
Comparator tests
z CT (local or whole body).
z MRI (local or whole body).
Reference standard
Included:
z histopathological findings or clinical follow-up for ≥6 months or both for all participants (differential 
reference standard was accepted because of the difficulty of biopsy when there was no indicated 
lesion to biopsy in test-negative patients).
Excluded:
z studies in which only some of the participants undergoing the index test also received any 
reference standard.

Outcome
z Studies that provided numerical data sufficient to create 2×2 tables of test results comparing index or 
comparator tests with the reference standard to provide information on test accuracy, giving true￾positive, true-negative, false-positive and false-negative results.
z Studies that provided any information on diagnostic impact: change in diagnosis and/or staging after 
PET-CT compared with existing tests or reference standard.
z Studies that provided therapeutic impact: change in treatment plan after PET-CT compared with 
existing tests or reference standard.
Study design
Included:
z any prospective or retrospective test accuracy studies
z any diagnostic before-and-after studies investigating diagnostic and therapeutic impact with or 
without concurrent assessment of test accuracy
z studies with >10 participants.
Excluded:
z studies on gynaecological cancers not providing separate data for the population with cervical cancer
z studies that described only lesion-based analysis rather than person-based analysis.
Quality assessment
Test accuracy quality assessment followed the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 
(QUADAS) guidelines40 and diagnostic and therapeutic impact quality assessment followed guidelines 
suggested by Meads and Davenport.41 The items of methodological quality listed in the QUADAS 
guidelines40 are a representative spectrum, selection criteria clearly described, acceptable reference 
standard, acceptable delay between tests, partial verification avoided, differential verification avoided, 
reference standard independent of the index test, index test described in sufficient detail, reference 
standard described in sufficient detail, index test results blinded, reference standard results blinded, 
relevant clinical information available, uninterpretable results reported, and withdrawals explained.
These items were tailored to assess the included studies because different aspects of quality are applicable 
to different topic areas. The actual quality items used for this report are listed in Table 2. For acceptable 
delay between tests, this included delay between the index test and the comparator test (within 1 month) 
and between the index test and PET-CT (with 1 month). There will inevitably be a delay between the index 
test and clinical follow-up (as this had to be >6 months). Differential verification was omitted because 
it was inevitable that the test positives would have a different reference standard (histology) to the test 
negatives (clinical follow-up).
Study quality was summarised in a table. Additional issues (e.g. study design characteristics, method of 
patient enrolment, technique of data collection) were also collected. Technical quality was assessed by a 
consultant radiologist with considerable experience in current cancer imaging techniques.
Methods of statistical analysis
RevMan version 5.1 (The Cochrane Collaboration, The Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark) 
and Stata version 11 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA) were used in the statistical analyses. True￾positives, false-positives, true-negatives and false-negatives were taken directly from the source papers and 
sensitivity and specificity calculated in RevMan. Equivocal results were used in sensitivity analyses by adding 
the total number of equivocal results to each of the true-positives, false-positives, true negatives and 
false-negatives in turn to derive maximum and minimum variation in sensitivity and specificity. Summary

estimates of sensitivity and specificity and summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves were 
derived as appropriate using recognised methods for meta-analysis of test accuracy. Results were displayed 
graphically on forest and SROC plots.42 Meta-analyses were undertaken when adequate results were 
available. A bivariate model that included a random-effects term for variation in accuracy and threshold 
between studies was fitted.43 When the model failed to converge or a correlation could not be estimated 
properly the bivariate model was simplified to two univariate random-effects logistic regression models by 
assuming no correlation between sensitivity and specificity. Although no correlation between sensitivity 
and specificity was assumed, a confidence region is shown on the SROC plot as an indication of the 
uncertainty surrounding the point estimate of sensitivity and specificity.
Methods for subjective elicitation
Rationale
Subjective probabilities were elicited from clinicians representing the disciplines of radiology, oncology and 
gynaecology. Eliciting subjective probabilities from clinicians had three roles in the planned investigation of 
the clinical effectiveness of PET-CT imaging in the detection and management of recurrent cervical cancer:
1. Providing data to populate the economic model in the absence of information found in the literature.
2. Supplementing information found in the literature. Literature may be sparse, of poor quality or 
not transferable to the UK setting. Information gained from clinicians in the form of subjective 
probabilities may be used to supplement information found in the literature and to enable sensitivity 
analyses to be performed as part of the economic model.
3. Planning the dissemination strategy for the results of the research. If there is wide variation in accuracy 
estimates elicited from clinicians, or if elicited estimates of accuracy are very discrepant with those 
found in the literature, this may impact on the successful dissemination of the research findings 
to clinicians.
Probabilities elicited
Informed by the preliminary results of the systematic reviews of test accuracy (and effectiveness), the 
research team decided on the data priorities for elicitation as follows:
1. To determine the prevalence of recurrence in women with an initial diagnosis of stage IB–IVA 
cervical cancer, who are assumed to be disease free for a minimum of 3 months post completion of 
primary treatment:
i. presenting with symptoms suggestive of recurrence
ii. in the absence of symptoms

16
2. To determine the test accuracy of chest, abdominal and pelvic CT and/or MRI performed at the 
discretion of clinicians in women with an initial diagnosis of stage IB–IVA cervical cancer, who are 
assumed to be disease free for a minimum of 3 months post completion of primary treatment:
i. presenting with symptoms suggestive of recurrence
ii. in the absence of symptoms (CT and/or MRI used for surveillance)
3. To determine the test accuracy of CT and/or MRI performed at the discretion of clinicians and of 
PET-CT (performed regardless of the result of initial imaging) in women with an initial diagnosis of 
stage IB–IVA cervical cancer, who are assumed to be disease free for a minimum of 3 months post 
completion of primary treatment:
i. presenting with symptoms suggestive of recurrence
ii. in the absence of symptoms (CT and/or MRI+PET-CT used for surveillance).
Information on rate of recurrence in women post completion of primary treatment as distinct from rate 
of recurrence in women following imaging was absent in the literature reviewed. Elicitation of accuracy 
data was necessary because of a lack of disaggregation of women with and without symptoms in the 
literature and because of the very limited accuracy data available. Elicitation also provided the opportunity 
to investigate the coherence of subjective probabilities elicited with estimates in the literature.
Methods used
Subjective probabilities were elicited by two project members (CD and CM) during an educational meeting 
of the West Midlands Gynaecology Oncology Specialist Group on 1 July 2011 at the City Hospital, 
Birmingham, UK. Following the success of this initial elicitation, as judged by the face validity of the 
findings, the results were supplemented by purposive sampling by clinicians in the project team and by 
two further meetings – a gynae-oncology multidisciplinary meeting at Barts Hospital, London, UK, on 
17 August 2011 and at the British Gynaecological Cancer Society Scientific Meeting at the International 
Convention Centre, Birmingham, UK, on 18 November 2011.
The initial elicitation exercise was preceded by a presentation outlining the aims of the project, the role of 
elicitation in the project, an overview of definitions of prevalence and test accuracy metrics to be elicited 
and a practice non-clinical elicitation exercise. Subsequent elicitations achieved by purposive sampling used 
a written description of the task and a printed elicitation example, except at the scientific meeting where a 
poster on the project was also displayed.
For the clinicians carrying out the first elicitations, the face-to-face pre-elicitation training, questions and 
discussion were conducted as a group to facilitate a common understanding of the problem and task and 
to allow participants to benefit from group discussion and interaction. Following the presentation and 
the non-clinical elicitation exercise (on estimated distance from London to Birmingham), participants were 
asked for written consent before undertaking the elicitation exercise. Participants were free to leave at any 
point in the exercise. Participants were instructed to undertake the elicitation exercise itself independently 
to ensure that variation within and across disciplines could be captured if there were sufficient numbers 
of respondents to allow subgroup analysis. In addition, mathematical aggregation (as opposed to 
behavioural aggregation) mitigates against the possibility of ‘consensus’ estimates being biased by the 
views of a minority.44
The elicitation exercise comprised an 11-page anonymous self-administered questionnaire 
(see Appendix 7). The questionnaire included background information on the length of time that 
participants had practised in their speciality, their use of current imaging techniques and their use of 
PET-CT. To be eligible participants did not have to have hands-on experience of using PET-CT. Use of PET-CT 
is not routine in this patient group and beliefs are shaped by factors other than first-hand experience, 
such as interaction with colleagues, published estimates of accuracy and knowledge of the technology. In 
addition to the probabilities elicited, participants were also asked to state the minimum important clinical 
difference in accuracy between imaging with CT and/or MRI and imaging with CT and/or MRI with the 
addition of PET-CT that they would require before choosing to use one or other imaging strategy routinely.

Accuracy data were elicited in the form of the proportion of test errors (false-positives and false-negatives) 
that would be expected with the use of the combinations of imaging technologies outlined above. The 
choice of test errors as a metric of accuracy is based on research suggesting that test accuracy metrics 
with test result as reference class are more intuitive45 and that the clinical utility of a test is commonly 
conceptualised using test errors.46 Test errors were used to derive positive predictive values (PPVs) and 
negative predictive values (NPVs). Elicited estimates of prevalence in combination with PPVs and NPVs were 
used to derive estimates of sensitivity and specificity for use in the economic model.
Elicitation of prevalence and test accuracy information was undertaken using the allocation of points 
technique whereby respondents are asked to indicate the likelihood of a value range being a true estimate 
by allocating a proportion of 100 points to that value range (the sum of allocated points across each 
value range summing to 100). In this way probability functions were obtained for each individual and 
were aggregated mathematically to derive an average distribution for the sample. An aggregated mean 
value was estimated using the average distribution and the midpoint of each value range. The variability 
of this aggregated mean was estimated by calculating the standard deviation (SD) across the value ranges. 
Microsoft Excel was used for calculations and graphical display of results.
Methods for effectiveness reviews
Search strategy
A sensitive search was conducted to identify all relevant published and unpublished trials and trials in 
progress. All databases were searched from inception to August 2010. Search strategies were designed 
from a series of test searches. Both MeSH terms and text words were used and included a variety of 
synonyms for recurrent cervical cancer and the interventions (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, palliative 
treatment, surgery). Strategies for MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library can be found in 
Appendix 8. Trials were identified from several sources including:
z general health and biomedical databases: MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), CENTRAL
z database searches for systematic reviews, from which primary studies could be identified, including 
MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid) and The Cochrane Library [Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 
(CDSR), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) and Health Technology Assessment (HTA) 
database]
z searches for studies in progress, unpublished research or research reported in the grey literature in a 
range of relevant databases including ClinicalTrials.gov and the UK Clinical Research Network Portfolio
z specialist search gateways (OMNI and the National Cancer Institute), general search engine (Google) 
and meta-search engine (Copernic) from March to May 2010
z hand-searches of Gynecologic Oncology from 1980 to May 2010
z reference lists of review articles and papers
z authors of the included studies, who were contacted for information on relevant published or 
unpublished studies.
Inclusion/exclusion criteria

Quality assessment
For the two designs found (RCTs and case series), quality assessment and presentation of results have been 
carried out separately.
Randomised controlled trials
Quality assessment of included RCTs was performed using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook 
for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.
37 Each study was assessed for adequate sequence generation, 
adequate allocation concealment, all methods of blinding used and whether or not they were effective, 
whether or not there was incomplete outcome data presented (attrition and exclusions from analysis), 
non-selective outcome reporting, and freedom from other biases. In all cases ‘yes’ indicated a low risk of 
bias and ‘no’ indicated a high risk of bias. ‘Unclear’ was used if there was insufficient detail reported. The 
quality of studies was summarised in tables, which were then used to create quality diagrams.
Case series
Quality assessment of case series was performed using the checklist developed by the National Institute for 
Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE).47 Each study was then awarded an overall study quality grading for 
internal validity and an overall study quality grading for external validity:
z ++: all or most of the checklist criteria have been fulfilled; where they have not been fulfilled the 
conclusions are very unlikely to alter.
z +: some of the checklist criteria have been fulfilled; where they have not been fulfilled, or not 
adequately described, the conclusions are unlikely to alter.
z –: few or no checklist criteria have been fulfilled and the conclusions are likely or very likely to alter.
Methods of reporting and statistical analysis
Most results are reported in tables. Information was analysed based on the group to which the participants 
were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. For dichotomous 
data, results are presented as summary relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Separate 
analyses were performed on randomised and non-randomised data. RRs were calculated from numbers of 
patients, using StatsDirect version 2.7.8 (StatsDirect, Altrincham, UK) or RevMan version 5.0. For adverse 
events, only grade 3 and grade 4 events were reported.
RevMan version 5.0 was also used for meta-analyses. Any heterogeneity of results between studies 
was statistically and graphically assessed and potential causes explored. To explore causes of clinical 
heterogeneity, a priori subgroup analyses were conducted to see whether variations in clinical factors, for 
example populations, interventions, outcomes or study quality, affected the estimation of effect sizes. The 
I
2
 statistic was used to assess heterogeneity between trials. In the absence of significant heterogeneity, 
results were pooled using a fixed-effects model. If substantial heterogeneity was detected (I
2 >50%), 
possible causes were explored and subgroup analyses for the main outcomes performed. Heterogeneity 
that was not explained by subgroup analyses was modelled using random-effects analysis where 
appropriate. For outcomes for which a meta-analysis was not appropriate, the RCT and non-randomised 
study results were presented, where possible, on a forest plot but without summary scores, allowing a 
visual presentation of the effects of each included trial. For case series, a narrative summary of the findings 
was given.
Methods for systematic review of economic evaluations
A systematic review was conducted to find published literature and work in progress on the economic 
evaluation of PET-CT for use in the detection of recurrent cervical cancer. The purpose of this review 
was to investigate the suitability of existing cost-effectiveness models and model designs and to identify

20
information that could be used to populate the model subsequently developed for this project. The aim 
was also to identify economic studies that reported costs and consequences associated with recurrent 
cervical cancer detected by the use of PET-CT. Systematic reviews of the effectiveness of treatments, 
with meta-analysis of clinical studies, particularly RCTs, use well-established research methods but the 
approach for reviewing economic evaluations and costing studies is necessarily slightly different and 
more qualitative, primarily because of the heterogeneity that exists in economic studies, which means 
that formal data synthesis and meta-analyses are rarely possible. This systematic review was carried out 
using PRISMA guidelines with adaptations appropriate for systematic reviews of economic evaluation and 
costing studies.39 In addition to the systematic review of economic evaluations, a separate literature review 
was conducted to find suitable generic quality-of-life values [including quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)] 
for use in the economic model.
Five electronic databases were searched [EMBASE, MEDLINE, NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS 
EED), DARE and HTA database] from 1980 to October 2011. Reference lists from relevant papers were also 
searched. Appendix 9 shows the detailed search strategies used. The inclusion criteria were:
z patients – those with recurrence or persistent cervical cancer who had previously completed treatment 
for their primary cervical cancer (primary cervical cancer alone was specifically excluded)
z intervention – PET-CT
z comparator – no PET-CT, other imaging
z outcomes – costs, cost-effectiveness, cost–utility, quality of life.
Studies were independently reviewed on the basis of their titles and abstracts by one researcher (PA). The 
screening process used followed established methods used to identify and categorise economic evaluation 
and costing studies.29 Briefly, a three-stage process was adopted. In stage 1, each study was categorised 
on the basis of its title and abstract (where available) into one of four groups. The two relevant groups for 
this review were group A – studies suspected of being full economic evaluations on PET-CT recurrence of 
cervical cancer – and group B – cost studies, but not economic evaluations. Group A and group B studies 
would proceed to stage 2 where they would be read in full and, if confirmed in their classification, would 
proceed to stage 3 for quality assessment. Appendix 9 shows the full details of the three-stage process.

Chapter 4 Diagnostic review results
Study selection
At the final update of May 2010 there were 7524 potentially relevant citations identified, of which 252 
full-text articles were retrieved. Subsequently, 240 articles were excluded (see list of excluded studies in 
Appendix 10). The most common reason for exclusion was either that the study was on patients with 
newly diagnosed cervical cancer before primary treatment or that the study was of the incorrect design. 
The numbers of included and excluded citations are shown in Figure 4. The 12 included studies evaluated 
the test accuracy of PET-CT, MRI or CT imaging for persistent or recurrent cervical cancer compared 
with a reference standard of biopsy, clinical follow-up or both. Six studies evaluated PET-CT,20,48–52 two 
evaluated MRI,53,54 three evaluated CT55–57 and one evaluated both MRI and CT.58 Table 3 shows the basic 
characteristics of the included studies and Table 4 provides definitions of the reference standards used. 
There were no studies that directly compared PET-CT with MRI or CT separately. One of the included 
studies49 compared PET-CT with standard imaging (MRI, CT or both) and gave results for both PET-CT and 
standard imaging in the same table.
No additional papers were found that evaluated diagnostic or therapeutic yield. One of the included 
studies20 gave information on diagnostic yield and also gave 2-year disease-free survival curves for 
participants with positive and negative PET-CT scans.
Characteristics of included studies
Population characteristics
The characteristics of the patient populations in the included studies are shown in Tables 5–7. The 
total number of patients in the studies ranged from 20 to 75 but some of the studies included any 
gynaecological cancers and others reported imaging results for both recurrent and primary cervical cancer. 
Therefore, the tables also report the number of patients with recurrent cervical cancer only and with 
imaging results. Many of the studies did not report summary patient characteristics for the patients with 
recurrent cervical cancer and imaging results only but for the full patient group, which is not relevant 
here and so has not been reported. When stated, most patients had squamous cell carcinoma; fewer 
had adenocarcinoma. In some studies, such as that by Chung et al.,
20 it was stated that histologically 
confirmed squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma or adenosquamous carcinoma of the uterine cervix 
was a requirement for study eligibility, but for others it was unclear.
All included studies except those by Mittra et al.51 and Hatano et al.53 described only women who 
had undergone treatment for histopathologically proven cervical cancer and who had suspected 
recurrence based on the presence of clinical signs and/or symptoms. The Mittra et al. study51 included 
both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients undergoing routine follow-up. The Hatano et al.53 study 
verified whether MRI could provide accurate information to evaluate residual tumours after radiotherapy 
(persistent disease) and the MRI findings were compared with cytology/histopathology before and 
after radiotherapy.
Six studies20,49, 50,52,56,58 described grounds on which the recurrence was suspected. Abnormal imaging and 
physical examination during follow-up were the main indications for performing PET-CT in the Chung et 
al.20 study. Each patient in the Grisaru et al.49 study had undergone a comprehensive evaluation of her 
clinical status and was scheduled for routine staging or follow-up imaging studies for suspected recurrence 
(but results were given only for suspected recurrence). Recurrence in Kitajima et al.50 was suspected on the 
basis of physical examination, elevated levels of tumour markers and abnormal findings of conventional

imaging, including CT and/or MRI, or an abnormal cervical smear. In Sironi et al.,
52 suspicion of tumour 
recurrence was based on follow-up procedures (physical examination, serum tumour markers and 
morphological imaging studies, such as CT or MRI). In Park et al.,
56 recurrence was suspected also on the 
basis of increased levels of serum squamous cell carcinoma antigen and carcinoembryonic antigen, pain 
in the lower abdomen and back, oedema of the lower leg and oliguria. The suspicion of recurrence in 
Williams et al.58 was based on the clinical features of pelvic pain, vaginal discharge, vaginal bleeding, lower 
limb swelling or a palpable mass on pelvic examination.
Imaging characteristics
All six PET-CT studies20,48–52 were evaluations of PET-CT after patients had received conventional imaging 
(MRI and/or CT) or CT only. Of the PET-CT studies, only Amit et al.48 focused on extracervical lesions, 
whereas the other five studies evaluated any recurrence. Only Park et al.56 used CT to evaluate any 
recurrence and the other five MRI and CT studies evaluated local recurrence in the pelvis only.

All six PET-CT studies used 18F-FDG as a radioisotope tracer, with doses of 370–555MBq,48 555–740MBq,20
370–666MBq,49 4.0MBq/kg,50 400–555MBq51 and 370MBq.52 The time between injection of 18F-FDG and 
the PET scan ranged from 30 minutes to 3 hours. The PET-CT scanning was performed mostly with a GE 
Discovery LS PET-CT scanner (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI, USA). In Amit et al.,
48 a hybrid PET-CT 
system combining a third-generation multislice spiral CT system [GE LightSpeed Plus (GE Medical Systems, 
Milwaukee, WI, USA)] with a dedicated full bismuth germanium oxide (BGO) ring PET scanner [GE Advance 
NXi (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI, USA)] was used. In Chung et al.20 a GEMINI PET-CT system 
(Philips, Guildford, UK) was used, and in Kitajima et al.50 all imaging and data acquisitions were performed 
with a Biograph Sensation 16 PET-CT scanner (Siemens Systems, Erlangen, Germany). Two studies48,50
measured glucose levels before administration of 18F-FDG.
In the three MRI studies53,54,58 T1-weighted spin-echo and T2-weighted turbo spin-echo were used. Of the 
four CT studies,55–58 two55,58 used optional intravenous contrast medium to elucidate problems identified 
on initial scans. Intravenous contrast medium was used routinely in the other two studies: non-ionic 
contrast (150mg)56 and Reno-M-DIP® contrast (400ml of 4% oral meglumine diatrizoate) (Squibb, 
Princeton, NJ, USA).57
Quality of studies
The results of the quality assessment are provided in Table 8. Four studies48,49,52,53 collected patients’ 
data prospectively (77 patients in total), seven studies20,50,51,54,56–58 collected data retrospectively (260 
patients in total) and in one of the studies55 there was no information on the method of enrolment. Three 
studies20,51,52 clearly described their inclusion criteria such as presence of symptoms indicating recurrence, 
new lesions on surveillance imaging, elevated serum tumour markers with or without abnormal imaging 
and abnormal results on physical or cytological examination on routine surveillance. Relevant clinical 
information such as age, FIGO stage, histology type of tumour and primary treatment were described in all 
studies except for those by Amit et al.,

7 – tests described in sufficient detail for replication; 8 – reference standard/index test blinded; 9 – relevant clinical 
information; 10 – uninterpretable results reported; 11 – withdrawals explained; 12- technical quality.
In all of the included studies the reference standard for diagnosis of cervical cancer was histopathology 
with or without clinical/radiological follow-up. Four of the studies48,53,57,58 used only histopathology as the 
reference standard, whereas in the other studies diagnosis was supported by clinical follow-up. Selection 
bias (using the imaging study being investigated as part of the inclusion criteria into the study) was present 
in at least four studies.20,50–52
Information to judge the presence of incorporation bias (in which the index test forms part of the 
reference standard) was unclear in almost all of the studies, but in Kitajima et al.50 the index test (PET-CT) 
was clearly part of the reference standard when the final diagnosis of 12 patients was based on the results 
of tumour marker level and PET-CT findings. Two studies reported the mean time between index test and 
reference standard, which was 2.3 weeks52 and 1 week.57 Readers of PET-CT, MRI and CT studies were 
reported to be blind to patients’ clinical details and final diagnosis in only four studies.49,50,54,58
With regard to technical quality, the methods used in the more modern studies were similar to currently 
used imaging methods, whereas the methods used in the older studies were not. In the PET-CT studies 
there was slight variation found in whether or not and how much oral hydration was used as well as slight 
differences in acquisition times and injected doses. Chung et al.20 used oral contrast for CT, but this should 
not affect the PET interpretation or results. Heron et al.55 incorporated lymphangiography, which is now no 
longer used.
Test accuracy
The numerical results for all included studies are shown in Table 9.

Positron emission tomography/computerised tomography
Six PET-CT test accuracy studies were found.20,48–52 Five studies20,49–52 evaluated local recurrence and 
distance metastasis and one study48 evaluated extrapelvic recurrence only. The sensitivities and specificities 
and their 95% CIs are shown in Figure 5 and a SROC space plot is shown in Figure 6. The sensitivities and 
specificities of local and distant recurrence were 83–100% and 71–100%, respectively, and the sensitivity 
and specificity of distant recurrence only were 86% and 100%. The summary estimates of the sensitivity 
and specificity of PET-CT for the detection of cervical cancer recurrence were 92.2% (95% CI 85.1% to 
96.0%) and 88.1% (95% CI 77.9% to 93.9%), respectively. Sensitivity analysis, omitting one study48 that 
reported accuracy for distant recurrence only, did not affect accuracy estimates to any significant degree 
[sensitivity 92.6% (95% CI 85.3% to 96.4%); specificity 87.3% (95% CI 76.6% to 93.5%)]. The results 
tables of the univariate random-effects regression model for the meta-analysis and sensitivity analysis are in 
Appendix 11.
Magnetic resonance imaging
Three MRI test accuracy studies were found and all evaluated the pelvis only.53,54,58 Weber et al.54 and 
Williams et al.58 included women with clinical suspicion of recurrence and Hatano et al.53 included women 
with residual, advanced-stage cervical cancer (stage IB2–IV). Previous treatment was radiotherapy in 
Hatano et al.53 and Weber et al.54 and 50% surgery and 50% radiotherapy in Williams et al.58 All three 
studies investigated local recurrence in the pelvis only. Distant recurrence was noted in Williams et al.58
(4/20), but these women were not included in the numerical results for sensitivity and specificity. Distant 
metastases are also mentioned in Hatano et al.53 Because of clinical heterogeneity between these studies, 
no meta-analysis was conducted. The sensitivities and specificities and their 95% CIs are shown in Figure 7
and a SROC space plot in Figure 8. The sensitivities and specificities of MRI in pelvic recurrence varied 
between 82% and 100% and 78% and 100% respectively.

Four CT test accuracy studies were found.55–58 Heron et al.,
55 Walsh et al.57 and Williams et al.58 investigated 
local recurrence only, whereas Park et al.56 investigated local and distant recurrence. [As mentioned in 
the MRI section, Williams et al.58 also mentioned 4 (of 20) women with distant recurrence, who were 
not included in the sensitivity and specificity statistics.] There is little information available on the patients 
included in Heron et al.55 and Walsh et al.57 Also, both Heron et al.55 and Walsh et al.57 have equivocal 
results. For six patients in the Heron et al.55 study, the CT findings were classified as equivocal; all of these 
patients had undergone radiotherapy, making differentiation between radiation fibrosis and recurrence 
difficult. For two patients in Walsh et al.,
57 CT images could not differentiate radiation sequelae from 
tumour. The sensitivities and specificities and their 95% CIs are shown in Figure 9 and a SROC space 
plot is shown in Figure 10. Because of clinical heterogeneity and lack of information about patients, no 
meta-analysis was conducted. The sensitivities and specificities of CT in pelvic recurrence (excluding the 
equivocal results) varied between 78% and 93% and 0% and 95% respectively. Sensitivity analysis around 
the equivocal results for Heron et al.55 varied the sensitivity from 75% to 94% and the specificity from 82% 
to 95%. Sensitivity analysis around the equivocal results for Walsh et al.57 varied the sensitivity from 87% to 
94% and the specificity from 0% to 50%.

Comparison of standard imaging followed by positron emission 
tomography/computerised tomography with standard imaging only
One study49 gave results in one table for both standard imaging alone and standard imaging with 
whole-body PET-CT with the same reference standard of histology or clinical evidence of disease, allowing 
comparisons to be made. Unfortunately, the part of the body imaged with standard imaging was not 
provided in the paper. The results are provided in Table 10. This shows that the PET-CT results are closer to 
the reference standard results than the standard imaging results.
Diagnostic and therapeutic impact
One included PET-CT study20 reported information on the diagnostic and therapeutic impact of 
the imaging. None of the included MRI or CT studies provided any details on whether or how the 
management of patients was altered by imaging.
In Chung et al.,
20 the mean age of patients was 53 years (range 32–77 years) and they had primarily 
stage I (50%) and stage II (40%) cancer. The results of PET-CT imaging were found to have an impact 
on the management of 12 patients (23%) by initiating previously unplanned treatment (four patients), 
changing the previously planned therapeutic approach (five patients) or eliminating a previously planned

patients: mediastinoscopic biopsy in three patients, PET-CT-guided pelvic lymph node biopsy in three 
patients, supraclavicular lymph node biopsy in two patients and bone biopsy in one patient. The PET-CT 
assisted in the planning of the therapeutic strategy in nine patients.
Chung et al.20 also reported the prognostic outcomes of patients undergoing PET-CT giving 2-year disease￾free survival rates and survival curves for women with positive and negative PET-CT results. The 2-year 
disease-free survival rates for women with a positive and a negative PET-CT result for recurrence were 
10.9% and 85.0% respectively (p=0002). The survival curves are reproduced in Figure 11.

Chapter 5 Results of the elicitation of subjective 
probabilities
T
he first face-to-face elicitation exercise resulted in responses from nine experts and subsequent sampling 
resulted in a further 12 completed elicited probabilities questionnaires. Prevalence of recurrence 
information was elicited from all respondents (21) and accuracy from 17–18 respondents. The self￾reported characteristics of respondents and their reported use of imaging technologies are outlined in 
Table 11 and Figure 12.
Prevalence of recurrence
Individual respondents’ prevalence of recurrence results are in Table 82 (symptomatic) and Table 83 
(asymptomatic) in Appendix 12. The mean elicited prevalence of recurrence in women presenting with 
symptoms a minimum of 3 months after completion of primary treatment was 47.8% (SD 20.8) and that 
for asymptomatic women was 16.7% (SD 13.1).
Accuracy
Individual respondents’ accuracy results (PPVs, NPVs) for MRI and/or CT and for MRI and/or CT with PET-CT 
for symptomatic and for asymptomatic women are given in Tables 85–92 in Appendix 12. Note that PPVs 
are the proportion of women who test positive on either CT or MRI at the discretion of a clinician (and 
PET-CT if used and performed regardless of the result of initial imaging) who are confirmed as having 
recurrence of cervical cancer on the basis of histology, and NPVs are the proportion of women who test 
negative on either CT or MRI at the discretion of a clinician (and PET-CT if used and performed regardless 
of the result of initial imaging) who are confirmed as not having recurrence on the basis of clinical 
follow-up. Summary results are shown in Table 12. These are shown graphically in Figures 13 and 14 for 
symptomatic and asymptomatic women respectively.
Minimum important clinical difference in accuracy between imaging 
with computerised tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging and 
imaging with computerised tomography and/or magnetic resonance 
imaging plus positron emission tomography/computerised tomography
The average minimum important increase in accuracy from the addition of PET-CT to CT and/or MRI that 
was considered necessary to warrant introduction of PET-CT as a routine investigation in this sample of 
clinical experts was similar for asymptomatic and symptomatic patients: a 7.7% reduction in false-positives 
and a 6.4% reduction in false-negatives for symptomatic women and an 8.7% reduction in false-positives 
and a 6.3% reduction in false-negatives for asymptomatic women. Mean elicited estimates of the 
differences in test accuracy between CT and/or MRI and CT and/or MRI plus PET-CT were 2.6 and 3.6 for 
PPV and NPV, respectively, for symptomatic women and 4.6 and 3.4 for PPV and NPV, respectively, for 
asymptomatic women.
The results suggest that, in our sample of experts, the elicited increase in accuracy as a result of the 
addition of PET-CT to MRI and/or CT is smaller than the elicited minimum important difference in accuracy 
required to justify the routine addition of PET-CT for the investigation of women post completion of 
primary treatment for cervical cancer, that is, all of the differences in false-positives and false-negatives in 
Table 12 are smaller than the minimum important clinical differences listed in the paragraph above.
Comparison with systematic review results
Comparison of elicited estimates of accuracy with those reported in the literature are complicated because 
of the age of the CT and MRI studies, the lack of disaggregation between symptomatic and asymptomatic

38
patients and a paucity of estimates of the combined accuracy of CT and MRI. Table 13 illustrates that 
elicited estimates of the accuracy of CT/MRI and CT/MRI plus PET-CT in symptomatic women are similar to 
estimates in the literature. For asymptomatic women the elicited specificities of CT/MRI and CT/MRI plus 
PET-CT are comparable to literature-based estimates but elicited estimates of sensitivity are lower. This 
is most likely to be a function of the spectrum of patients in included studies; inclusion of symptomatic 
patients in studies in the literature would be expected to result in higher sensitivity.

T
he database searches for primary studies identified 24,972 citations, 24,943 citations from the 
database searches and 29 citations from other sources such as reference lists. Of these, 4618 were 
duplicates, leaving 20,354 unique citations. Sifting of titles and abstracts excluded 19,994 citations, 
leaving 360 full-text articles to be assessed for eligibility. Of these, 42 papers were unavailable and 250 
papers were excluded as irrelevant: 118 on the wrong population (many with primary and recurrent 
cervical cancer presented together), 24 on the wrong intervention, 33 with irrelevant outcomes and 75 
with inadequate study designs. For a list of excluded papers, see Appendix 13. One existing systematic 
review59 and a relevant guideline3
 were found. The systematic review included 15 RCTs on chemotherapy 
in recurrent, metastatic or persistent cervical cancer. The searches for this systematic review were to 
2006. Additional searches found four RCTs on chemotherapy. For surgery and radiotherapy, no systematic 
reviews or RCTs were found and all included studies were case series. In total, 68 papers were included: 
19 RCTs of chemotherapy (25 papers), 27 case series in surgery and 16 case series in radiotherapy and 
chemoradiotherapy (Table 14 and Figure 15).
Chemotherapy agents
Nineteen RCTs (25 publications) compared one or more chemotherapeutic agents in women with recurrent 
or persistent or advanced (stage IVB) cervical cancer. There were eight RCTs with single-agent cisplatin 
regimens, four with cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens, three with carboplatin (CBDCA)-based 
chemotherapy regimens and four with non-platinum-containing agents (Table 15). There were no RCTs 
investigating the effectiveness of cisplatin compared with placebo or no treatment in which both arms 
were given another chemotherapeutic agent. Baseline characteristics are shown in Appendix 14. The 
results for each category are given in the following sections.
Effectiveness of single cisplatin agents
Characteristics of included studies
Eight RCTs gave information about the effectiveness of single cisplatin agents as palliative treatment for 
recurrent, persistent or advanced cervical cancer (see Table 15). Baseline characteristics, including previous 
treatment, stage and site of disease, presented in Table 16, were well balanced between groups.

Quality of studies
All studies were RCTs with no blinding, but the description of randomisation was provided in only three 
trials.71,78,80 In Long et al.,
71 patients were randomly assigned to the treatment regimens with equal 
probability using a fixed-block design; patients were stratified by treating institution only. In Moore et 
al.,
78 randomisation (with equal probability to each of the treatment arms) was carried out using a block 
design that balanced the sequence of assigned arms within parent institutions. In Omura et al.,
80 patients 
were prospectively stratified according to whether or not they had received previous radiation-sensitizer 
treatment (hydroxyurea, cisplatin or fluorouracil) and by Karnofsky performance score, and were then 
centrally randomised with equal probability to three groups. 
Description of allocation concealment was not reported in any of the included studies. Several studies had 
methodological ambiguities. In Alberts et al.,
60 one of the treatment arms, cisplatin, was dropped early 
because of poor accrual; the number of patients in the cisplatin group was much lower than in the other 
two groups (9 vs 54 and 51). In Cadron et al.,
65 the intention had been to include 200 patients in the 
trial but because of poor accrual the trial was stopped prematurely and only 24 patients were included. 
In Long et al.,
71 the methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin and cisplatin (MVAC) arm was closed by the

Effectiveness review

Data Safety Monitoring Board after four treatment-related deaths occurred among 63 patients, and results 
for the MVAC arm were not reported. In Vermorken et al.,
82 45 patients from the cisplatin group received 
bleomycin, vindesine, mitomycin and cisplatin (BEMP) as second-line treatment. The quality assessment 
results are shown in Figures 16 and 17.
Effectiveness results
Overall survival, progression-free survival and overall response duration
In Alberts et al.,
60 median survival durations associated with receiving cisplatin, mitomycin C and cisplatin 
and mitomycin C, vincristine, bleomycin and cisplatin (MVBC) treatment were 17.0, 7.0 and 6.9 months 
respectively. However, because of the small number of patients in the cisplatin arm, meaningful 
comparison with other treatments cannot be made. Bonomi et al.64 found no appreciable differences in 
median survival duration and time to tumour progression for any of the cisplatin regimens. In Cadron 
et al.,
65 median survival in the cisplatin group amounted to 13 months and in the group treated with 
cisplatin, ifosfamide and 5-fluorouracil regimen to 12.3 months; data for progression-free survival 
were not provided. In Long et al.,
71 median survival was 6.5 months in the cisplatin-treated group and 
9.4 months in the group receiving the cisplatin/topotecan combination. The unadjusted and adjusted 
RR estimates for survival were 0.76 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.98) and 0.77 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.99), respectively, 
favouring the combination. Statistically significant differences were also observed in progression-free 
survival, favouring the combination [unadjusted RR 0.76 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.97); adjusted for covariates 
0.74 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.94)]. In Moore et al.,
78 the median progression-free survival for patients receiving 
cisplatin alone and cisplatin and paclitaxel was 2.8 and 4.8 months respectively (p=0.001). There was 
no difference in median survival between patients receiving cisplatin alone and patients receiving cisplatin 
and paclitaxel (8.8 months and 9.7 months respectively). In Omura et al.,
80 progression-free survival 
was statistically significantly longer for cisplatin and ifosfamide than for cisplatin alone (median, 4.6 vs 
3.2 months, p=0.003); however, there was no difference between cisplatin and mitolactol and cisplatin 
alone. There was no significant difference in survival between cisplatin and either of the combination 
regimens. In Vermorken et al.82 there was neither a significant difference in progression-free survival nor a 
significant difference in overall survival between BEMP and cisplatin although, according to the authors, 
for the former, a trend in favour of BEMP existed.
The results for median overall survival, progression-free survival and duration of response are given in 
Tables 17–19 respectively.
Response rates
Response rates, complete response rates and partial response rates for the RCTs are shown in Table 20. 
This shows that combinations are mostly more effective than single-agent cisplatin, but there is not always 
consistency in effect direction between the three response rates. For several RCTs65,66,80,82 the complete 
response rates were not statistically significant, whereas the response rates and/or partial response rates 
were significant.
Quality of life
Two RCTs had separate publications with quality-of-life data – quality-of-life data from the study by Long et 
al.71 were reported in Monk et al.72 and quality-of-life data from the study by Moore et al.78 were reported 
in McQuellon et al.77 For Long et al.,
71 patients completed quality-of-life assessments using the Functional 
Assessment of Cancer Therapy – General (FACT-G) questionnaire, the neurotoxicity (NTX) subscale, the 
Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), the Cx subscale and the UNISCALE at four time points during the study. However, 
there were no statistically significant differences in quality of life up to 9 months after randomisation 
between cisplatin plus topotecan and cisplatin. It should be noted that in the combination arm increased 
toxicity was observed.
In the study by Moore et al.,
78 patients were assessed at baseline and at three time points thereafter (prior 
to chemotherapy cycles 2, 3 and 4) on the FACT-G and subscales. Despite increased toxicity (grades 3–4

anaemia and grades 3–4 neutropenia) in the combination arm (cisplatin and paclitaxel) there were no 
statistically significant differences in scores between the groups at any assessment point.
Adverse events
Haematological toxicity (neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia and anaemia) 
was generally more frequently associated with cisplatin in combination with other agents than with 
cisplatin monotherapy (Tables 21–24). Infections were more common with combination therapy than with 
single-agent cisplatin (cisplatin+topotecan arm: 26/147, cisplatin-only arm: 12/146;71 BEMP arm: 7/143, 
cisplatin-only arm: 3/14482). There was little difference in neuropathy between combination therapy and 
single-agent cisplatin (cisplatin+paclitaxel arm: 4/129, cisplatin-only arm: 6/130;78 BEMP arm: 7/143, 
cisplatin-only arm: 3/14482). Alopecia was also more common with combination therapy than with 
single-agent cisplatin (MVBC arm: 12/54, mitomycin C and cisplatin arm: 2/51, cisplatin-only arm: 0/9;60
BEMP arm: 81/143, cisplatin-only arm: 31/14482). The results for nausea and/or vomiting are shown in

Effectiveness of cisplatin combinations
Characteristics of included studies
Four RCTs contained relevant information about the effectiveness of cisplatin combinations as palliative 
treatment for recurrent, metastatic or persistent cervical cancer.62,63,76,79 Baseline characteristics (including 
previous treatment and stage or site of disease) presented in Table 26 were well balanced between the 
groups. However, not all relevant clinical information was presented in all publications.

Quality of studies
Only two studies63,76 specified the method of randomisation in their reports. Description of allocation 
concealment was not reported in any of the included RCTs. Until January 2004, the Monk et al.76 study 
consisted of only two arms comparing cisplatin plus paclitaxel with cisplatin plus vinorelbine. Primary 
analyses excluded those 41 patients. In Bezwoda et al.,
62 after a preliminary analysis of the results, the 
hydroxyurea arm of the study was discontinued and a further 25 patients received the cis-diamminedichl
oroplatinum(II) (DDP) plus methotrexate regimen. Figures 18 and 19 show the results of the 
quality assessment.
Effectiveness results
Overall and progression-free survival
Overall and progression-free survival results are presented in Tables 27 and 28 respectively. All four trials 
reported median overall survival, and values were highest for the cisplatin, ifosfamide and paclitaxel arm 
in Mountzios et al.,
79 reaching 15.4 months (95% CI 8.6 to 22.3 months). The hazard ratio was given 
by Monk et al.76 and Mountzios et al.79 These results indicate that there were no statistically significant 
differences between chemotherapeutic schemes in any of the included studies.
The progression-free survival results were available in three RCTs63,76,79 and hazard ratios were provided 
by two.76,79 Multivariate Cox analysis for progression-free survival was performed in Mountzios et al.79
and indicated a statistically significantly longer progression-free survival for the cisplatin, ifosfamide and 
paclitaxel arm [hazard ratio 0.70 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.99), p=0.046].
Response rate
All of the RCTs reported response rates but complete and partial response rate was available only in three 
trials;62,76,79 Bloss et al.63 did not report complete and partial response rates. Response rates and risk ratios 
are presented in Table 29.

Adverse events
Haematological adverse events were high in all RCTs (Tables 30–33). Bezwoda et al.62 did not specify the 
grade of reported adverse events. The authors mentioned that therapy was generally well tolerated but 
that all patients receiving high-dose hydroxyurea developed leucopenia with a nadir 10–14 days after 
the initial loading dose; however, all patients recovered rapidly. Haematological toxicity was rare in the 
cisplatin plus methotrexate-treated patients (two patients) and stomatitis occurred in only one patient. 
In Bloss et al.63 toxicity was graded according to standard Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) criteria, 
in Monk et al.76 the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC) version 2.0, was used 
for characterising adverse events and dose modifications and in Mountzios et al.79 The World Health 
Organization criteria were used in the assessment of toxicity. It was not appropriate to combine toxicity 
results because of differences in chemotherapy regimens in the RCTs.
Bezwoda et al.62 mentioned that three patients developed hypokalaemia and three developed symptomatic 
hypocalcaemia, two of whom also had hypomagnesaemia. Monk et al.76 reported a significantly smaller 
proportion of patients with adverse events such as vomiting and nausea in the topotecan/cisplatin and

gemcitabine/cisplatin arms compared with the paclitaxel/cisplatin arm (Table 34). No significant differences 
in frequency of non-haematological adverse drug reactions between the chemotherapeutic arms was 
observed in the other RCTs. In Mountzios et al.79 alopecia occurred in 48 out of 72 patients in the cisplatin 
and ifosfamide arm, and 52 out of 77 patients in the cisplatin, ifosfamide and paclitaxel arm.
Effectiveness of other platinum agents
Characteristics of included studies
Three RCTs evaluated the effectiveness of other platinum agents as palliative treatment for recurrent, 
persistent or advanced cervical cancer.68,74,81 Baseline characteristics including previous treatment and stage 
and site of disease are presented in Table 35 showing that the groups were comparable in each of the 
included studies. Chemotherapy as previous treatment was given in the study by Lira-Puerto et al.
68 and 
radiotherapy and surgery were given in all trials.
Quality of studies
The description of randomisation was provided only in McGuire et al.74 None of the trials gave any details 
of the method of allocation concealment. In the study by Lira-Puerto et al.,68 accrual was suspended in 
two institutions because of termination of support. The results of the quality assessment are provided in 
Figures 20 and 21.

Effectiveness results
Overall and progression-free survival
All RCTs reported overall survival and two reported progression-free survival (Tables 36 and 37). There 
was little difference in overall survival or progression-free survival between arms in each RCT. Hazard ratio 
results were not supplied for any of the included studies. 
Response rate
Two of the RCTs68,74 gave response rates, complete response rates and partial response rates for the same 
treatment comparisons and so meta-analysis was possible (Figures 22–24). There were no statistically 
significant differences in terms of frequency of response rate (overall, partial, complete) between these 
cisplatin agents. However, it should be noted that there were differences between studies in the frequency 
of response rate in the CBDCA arms (ranging from 15% to 33%) as well as in the iproplatin (CHIP) arms

Effectiveness of non-platinum agents
Characteristic of included studies
Four studies gave evidence on the effectiveness of non-platinum agents for the treatment of recurrent, 
persistent or advanced cervical cancer.61,67,75,83 Because two studies67,83 were, unfortunately, impossible 
to obtain, analysis was conducted on the basis of the systematic review by Hirte et al.
59 Baseline 
characteristics including previous treatment and stage and site of disease are presented in Table 38; 
however, not all relevant clinical information was presented in all publications.
Quality of studies
As full texts were impossible to obtain for Greenberg et al.67 and Wallace et al.,
83 the quality assessment 
was based on the systematic review by Hirte et al.
59 A description of the allocation concealment procedure 
was not reported in any of the RCTs and blinding was not used in any of the RCTs. In Barlow et al.,

two patients with squamous cell tumours were mistakenly randomised as non-squamous cell tumours 
and received adriamycin (ADM) alone (group of 21+2 patients). In Monk et al.,
75 patients were initially 
randomly assigned to combination and monotherapy arms. The protocol was later amended after receiving

Response rate
There were no statistically significant differences between any of the non-platinum agents in the frequency 
of overall, complete and partial response rates (Table 41). In Monk et al.,
75 9% of the pazopanib arm and 
four patients (5%) in the lapatinib arm achieved a confirmed tumour response. It should be noted that the 
unconfirmed response rate was 19% for pazopanib-treated patients and 9% for lapatinib-treated patients.
Quality of life
None of the RCTs reported quality of life.
Adverse events
Haematological grade 3 or 4 adverse events were presented in Monk et al.75 and Wallace et al.83 No 
statistically significant differences were observed between the treatment arms for neutropenia (pazapanib 
arm 2/74 vs lapatinib arm 0/7675), thrombocytopenia (ADM+vincristine arm 2/61 vs ADM arm 4/61 vs 
ADM+cyclophosphamide arm 1/5283), leucopenia (ADM+vincristine arm 15/61 vs ADM arm 15/61 
vs ADM+cyclophosphamide arm 12/5283) and anaemia (pazapanib arm 2/74 vs lapatinib arm 4/7675). 
The frequency of non-haematological adverse events (grade 3 or above) was low in patients receiving 
non-platinum agents. The most common adverse event was diarrhoea (pazapanib arm 8/74 vs lapatinib 
arm 10/7675). In Monk et al.,
75 the results for nausea were 2 out of 74 patients in the pazapanib arm 
compared with 1 out of 76 patients in the lapatinib arm; for anorexia there were 2 out of 74 patients in

Radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy
Study selection
Included in this section are studies in which participants have recurrent or persistent cervical cancer 
that was initially treated with surgery and who now have evidence of recurrence. The interventions are 
radiotherapy or radiotherapy with chemotherapy (chemoradiotherapy). The search for relevant studies 
did not identify any RCTs but 16 case series met the inclusion criteria: nine evaluated radiotherapy84–92 and 
seven evaluated chemoradiotherapy.93–99 The results of the quality assessment for the radiotherapy and 
chemoradiotherapy studies are presented in Appendix 15.
Radiotherapy
Population characteristics
The characteristics of the populations in the radiotherapy studies are presented in Table 42. Most of 
the nine case series84–92 included a small number of patients (median 82 cases, range 18–130 cases). 
Study locations included the UK, the USA, Japan, the Netherlands and Germany. The majority of women 
presented with early-stage cervical cancer, but in three studies86,87,91 there was no information about 
FIGO stage. The proportion of patients with recurrent or persistent disease in the pelvis as the only site of 
cancer (central recurrence) was lower than the proportion developing distant metastases. Patients with 
central recurrence, defined as confined to the vagina or paravaginal tissues not extending to the pelvis, 
constituted 44% of the total population in the included studies. Squamous cell carcinoma was the most 
common histological type of cancer, being present in 79% of patients; adenocarcinoma was present in 
10.33%. The histological type was not available in four studies.
Description of the intervention
Descriptions of the salvage radiotherapy in curative intent and previous surgery are provided in Table 43. 
Radical hysterectomy was the most common previous surgery type and was performed in 61.8% 
of patients.

of recurrence of 10Gy/9Gy/10.8Gy was given. If para-aortic lymph node metastases existed, 
they were treated with 46/50.4Gy. In total, a dose of 50–64Gy was delivered to the site of 
recurrence – patients with recurrence at the pelvic/rectal wall or in case of a high tumour 
burden intravaginally
Combination of external irradiation and vaginal brachytherapy: 45/50.4Gy was given to 
the whole pelvis by external beam radiotherapy using a four-field box technique. A boost 
of 9Gy was given in case of tumours at the pelvic wall, sometimes with midline blocking 
respecting the afterloading applicator, sometimes without midline blocking. Each single field 
was treated daily. High-dose-rate brachytherapy using a single linear source arrangement was 
given with either 2×5Gy or 3×5Gy. If para-aortic lymph node metastases existed, they were 
treated with 46/50.4Gy. In total, a dose of 55–65Gy was delivered to the site of recurrence –

(50Gy) was delivered using conventional anterior–posterior parallel opposed fields. Following 
30Gy, a central shield (4-cm width) was inserted to cover the brachytherapy target area 
in the patients with small or medium tumours, to avoid overdosage to the bladder and 
rectum. Patients with large tumours received 50Gy whole-pelvis irradiation without a central 
shield. All patients in this series received high dose rate intracavitary brachytherapy using 
a caesium-137 source (7.4×1010Bq) for each colpostat. Patients with small or medium 
tumours received 5Gy intracavitary irradiation twice a week to a total dose of 30Gy in six

Results
Overall survival and progression-free survival The reported 2-year survival rates ranged from 12% to 
85% and 5-year survival rates ranged from 2% to 82%. Patients with pelvic side wall recurrences were 
found to have poorer prognoses than patients with central recurrences only (range 2–15% and 42–82%, 
respectively, for 5-year survival). Data for 10-year overall survival were provided in Ito et al.,
87 with a 52% 
rate for patients with centrally recurrent tumours of the vaginal stump following hysterectomy for cervical 
cancer. Additionally, they showed that survival was greatly influenced by the tumour size of the vaginal 
stump so that the 10-year survival rate of patients with small-sized tumours was 72%, whereas the 
corresponding survival rate of patients with medium-sized tumours was 48% (Table 44).
Complications Five studies gave complication rates.86–88,90,92 In Hille et al.,
86 grade 3 late toxicity was 
observed in 8% of patients, including intestinal bleeding after 7 months and fistulae between the 
rectosigmoid colon and the vagina, removed subsequently by surgery. In Ito et al.,
87 late complications 
of radiotherapy, including intestinal and urinary complications of grade 2 and grade 3, occurred in 32% 
of patients. In Jain et al.,
88 one patient suffered from morbidity in the sigmoid colon requiring surgical 
resection and in Lucraft90 seven cases of complications were observed, including transient proctitis, 
intermittent haematuria and severe acute bowel reactions. In Tan et al.,
92 major complications included 
fistulae, proctitis and cystitis (see Table 44).

Population characteristics
Seven studies93–99 were identified and their baseline patient characteristics are provided in Table 45. Most 
included a small number of patients (median 30 cases, range 13–49 cases). Study location included the 
USA, the UK, Canada, Japan, Italy and the Netherlands. The majority of women presented with early￾stage cervical cancer. In three studies93,94,97 there were no data on FIGO stage. In each of the studies the 
proportion of patients with disease recurrent or persistence in the pelvis as the only site of cancer (central 
recurrence) was lower than the proportion developing distant metastases. Patients with central recurrence 
constituted 37% of the total population in the included studies. Squamous cell carcinoma was the most 
common histological type of cancer, being present in 77% of patients. The histological type was not 
available in Haasbeek et al.94
Description of the intervention
Descriptions of the salvage chemotherapy and radiotherapy given are provided in Table 46. Radical 
hysterectomy was the most common previous surgery type and was performed in 81% of patients.
Results
Overall survival and progression-free survival Overall survival and progression-free survival results are 
presented in Table 47. Results for 2-year survival ranged between 44% and 93%. Patients with central 
recurrences had a 63–69% 5-year survival rate; the rate for studies with mixed recurrence was between 
41% and 47%; and the rate for patients with recurrence extending to the pelvic wall was between 18% 
and 28%. Data for 10-year overall survival were provided in Grigsby et al.93 and Haasbeek et al.,
94 with a 
range of 33–35% with central recurrence or recurrence extending to pelvic wall. Survival rates were also 
available for subpopulations of patients with central recurrence (55%) and recurrence extending to the 
pelvic wall (15%). In Grigsby et al.,
93 15-year overall survival for patients with central or with pelvic wall 
involvement was 35%. Central recurrences had a higher 5-year progression-free survival probability than 
those from all other patients (24–48% vs 1–27%).
Complications Grade 3/4 adverse events were observed in 27% of patients in Grigsby et al.,
93 17% in 
Haasbeek et al.94 and 31% in Maneo et al.96 Tsuda et al.98 presented results for particular adverse events: 
grade 3/4 leucocytopenia/neutrocytopenia – 66.7%; grade 4 haematological toxicity – 20%; grade 3

brachytherapy or both, aiming at a total dose to the boost planning target volume of at 
least 60Gy, but preferably higher. Brachytherapy was applied using a vaginal cylinder, ring or 
individually customised applicator to boost central tumour mass in the vaginal vault, when 
applicable (35 patients)
Radiotherapy and hyperthermia: locoregional hyperthermia treatment using a four-waveguide

Chemotherapy: CBDCA was given as a 5-minute intra-arterial infusion without hydration 
just before pelvic radiation q.d. Dose escalation was performed. The starting dosage was 
10mg/m2 q.d. At least three new patients were to be recruited for each dose level. If two of 
three patients at any dose level developed DLTs, the study was terminated. Three additional 
patients were treated at a dose level if one of the first three patients exhibited DLT. If at least 
four of six patients developed DLT at this level, then a MTD was said to have been reached The 
following dose levels were evaluated: 10, 15, 20 and 25mg/m2
Radiation: external pelvic irradiation was performed according to local standard schedules. The 
target volume was tumour and regional pelvic lymph nodes. External beam radiotherapy was 
given in daily fractions: 28 fractions of 1.8Gy were given to the tumour and regional pelvic 
nodes; fractions were administered daily except for Saturday and Sunday
Hyperthermia: after 20Gy had been administered, the lesion was heated for 60 minutes with 
a Thermothron radio frequency-8 system (Yamamoto Vinita, Osaka, Japan), once a week for 
4 weeks. Pelvic heating was performed with 30-cm electrodes operated anteroposteriorly 
or laterally. During the heating process, cold water (0–5ºC) was circulated in a cooling pool 
between the patient’s skin and the electrodes. The treatment objective was the achievement 
of a tumour temperature ≥41ºC for a period of 30minutes. The heat-up time was a max. of 
60 minutes. If during heat up a temperature of 41ºC could not be achieved, treatment with 
the highest obtainable temperature was performed for 30 minutes. Power was applied to a 
max. wattage ranging from 600W to 1200W with a median of 900W. Max. tumour indicative 
temperatures achieved ranged from 39°C to 42ºC with a mean temperature of 40.6

al.93 included leg oedema in 32% of patients, deep-vein thrombosis in 9% of patients and grade 3 cystitis 
in 27% of patients. In eight patients who survived beyond 5 years, the following grade 4 complications 
occurred: a vesicovaginal fistula (four patients), a rectovaginal fistula (three patients) and a life-threatening 
pelvic abscess (four patients) (see Table 47).
Surgery
Study selection
Included in this section are studies in which participants have recurrent or persistent cervical cancer that 
was initially treated with radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy and who now have evidence of recurrence. 
The interventions are radical hysterectomy or Wertheim’s operation and pelvic exenteration, and these 
two categories are described separately. The search found no relevant RCTs. Twenty-seven case series100–126 
fulfilled the inclusion criteria, most of which were retrospective, based on chart reviews. Most of the 
excluded papers were case series of gynaecological cancers as a whole without giving separate results 
for cervical cancer patients, or studies of cervical cancer patients with primary and recurrent tumour 
characteristics with the results described together. The results of the quality assessment are presented in 
Appendix 16. No measure of quality of life was provided in any of the included studies.
Radical hysterectomy population characteristics
Seven case series100–106 gave information on radical hysterectomy (Table 48). They were published between 
1965 and 1999 and were mostly from the USA, Canada and the European Union (Italy and Denmark). The 
number of participants ranged from 14 to 79. The mean or median age of patients was approximately 
50 years. Most participants were classified at FIGO stage II and had squamous cell carcinoma.
Pelvic exenteration population characteristics
Twenty case series,107–126 published between 1953 and 2009, presented results on pelvic exenteration, 
mostly from the USA (Table 49). The number of patients varied between 14 and 263. The mean or 
median age of the women was around 50 years (range 20–76 years). In many cases details about the 
baseline characteristics of the subpopulation of interest were incomplete but, in those publications in 
which the information was presented, most patients were classified as FIGO stage II and had squamous 
cell carcinoma.
Radical hysterectomy intervention
Descriptions of the interventions are provided in Table 50. In five studies,100,101,103–105 radical hysterectomy 
was conducted as salvage surgery with curative intent. Tupper106 described Wertheim’s operation, and 
in Ibsen et al.102 both Wertheim’s operation and pelvic exenteration (which could be total, anterior or 
posterior) were combined with pelvic lymph node dissection. In all case series the primary therapy was 
radiotherapy. In Maneo et al.,
103 chemotherapy with cisplatin was also used postoperatively. The median 
time from previous therapy to salvage surgery in curative intention was between 7.5 and 19 months.
Pelvic exenteration intervention
Descriptions of the interventions are provided in Table 51. All patients in the case series had radiotherapy 
as their primary treatment. Total pelvic exenteration (TPE) was conducted most often compared with 
anterior or posterior pelvic exenteration. Reconstructive procedures were performed frequently as part of 
the operations or scheduled at a time when the patient’s condition allowed it.
Radical hysterectomy results
The results of the radical hysterectomy case series are presented in Table 52. Operative deaths occurred 
in Rubin et al.104 – 10% (from sepsis); postoperative deaths were analysed in four studies and occurred

in 0%,105 2% (from sepsis),101 2%102 and 7.6%106 of patients. Survival results were presented in all 
publications. Five-year survival rates ranged between 32% and 72% and 5-year survival rates with no 
evidence of disease ranged between 27% and 65%. In Adcock100 and Coleman et al.,
101 5-year survival 
rates were also available for subpopulations of patients with persistent cervical cancer (52% and 82% 
respectively) and recurrent cervical cancer (65% and 75% respectively). Ten-year survival rates were 
presented in Coleman et al.101 only and were 60% for the total population, 68% for the persistent 
subpopulation and 54% for the recurrent subpopulation. The rate of recurrence was between 32% and 
59%. Major complications included fistulae, which required further surgical interventions.
Pelvic exenteration results
The results of the pelvic exenteration case series are shown in Table 53. Operative mortality ranged from 
0% to 22% and postoperative mortality from 15% to 33%. The total percentage of complications varied 
between 50% and 69%. Three studies103,107,124 gave 2-year survival rates: Stanhope et al.103 for the complete 
population only (75%), Anthopoulos et al.107 based on the type of surgery used (TPE 73%, anterior pelvic 
exenteration 75%) and Symonds et al.124 according to pelvic lymph node status (positive 29%, negative 
54%). Five-year survival rates ranged from 33% to 66% with one very low exception (12%) in Bricker et 
al.110 The 5-year survival rates after specific types of exenteration were 58%122 and 71.5%125 for anterior 
exenteration and 42%122 and 64.6%125 for total exenteration. When there were metastases to pelvic lymph 
nodes (positive status), 2–25% of patients survived 5 years. For patients without metastases to pelvic 
lymph nodes (negative status), 5-year survival was between 17% and 73% (but 5-year survival for TPE 
was 7%). The 10-year survival rate was presented in only one study (23%).124 The rate of recurrence varied 
by type of exenteration and whether there was local or distant spread. General information about the 
incidence of complications was very scarce.
Summary of accuracy and effectiveness results and inputs to 
economic evaluation
Statement of principal findings
Diagnostic studies and subjective elicitation
z Six studies20, 48–52 evaluating conventional imaging plus PET-CT, two studies53,54 evaluating MRI, three 
studies55–57 evaluating CT and one study58 evaluating both MRI and CT were included.
z The dates of the studies varied between 1981 and 2009.
z Most of the studies were small and several reported only a subset of results in a form that could be 
converted to a 2×2 table.
z The quality of the studies was poor. Although most probably included a representative spectrum of 
cervical cancer, very little clinical information about participants was given. Most studies did not report 
the time gap between the imaging test and the reference standard and most studies did not describe 
the reference standard clearly enough for replication.
z The later studies evaluated PET-CT, whereas the earlier studies evaluated CT and MRI. The technical 
imaging standards have changed since the early studies (reported in the 1980s) and so these are no 
longer valid. None of the MRI or CT studies used current standard methods.
z Five of the six PET-CT studies evaluated the whole body for recurrences and one reported extrapelvic 
recurrence only. Five of the six CT and MRI studies evaluated pelvic recurrences only and the newest 
evaluated whole-body recurrences, but this study included only 36 participants.
z Meta-analysis was conducted on PET-CT studies, which gave a combined sensitivity of 92.2% (95% 
CI 85.1% to 96.0%) and a specificity of 88.1% (95% CI 77.9% to 93.9%). Meta-analysis was not 
appropriate for the MRI and CT studies because of clinical heterogeneity.
z There was one study on the diagnostic and therapeutic impact of PET-CT,20 which found that it had 
an impact on management in 12 (out of 52) patients and additional invasive diagnostic procedures in 
nine patients and assisted in planning therapy in nine patients.

Effectiveness review
102
z The subjective elicitation exercise obtained opinions from 21 clinical experts using a structured 
questionnaire. The results for accuracy in symptomatic women were similar to those from the 
published test accuracy studies. No comparison was possible for asymptomatic women.
z There was insufficient information in the published literature to use the results as the base case 
for the economic evaluation and so the subjective elicitation results were used, with the published 
information in sensitivity analyses.
z The subjective elicitation found that the elicited increase in accuracy from adding PET-CT to CT or MRI 
was less than the elicited minimum important difference in accuracy required to justify its routine 
addition in clinical practice.
Effectiveness
z A total of 19 RCTs60–83 on chemotherapy (25 papers), 16 case series84–99 on radiotherapy and 
chemoradiotherapy and 27 case series100–126 on radical hysterectomy and pelvic exenteration 
were included.
z The dates of the publications varied between 1953 and 2010.
z For chemotherapy, the quality of the RCTs was variable, with little information on allocation 
concealment and none using blinding of patients and outcome measurement.
z There was no information on the effectiveness of cisplatin used as a single therapeutic agent. In 
comparisons of cisplatin with multiple chemotherapy, cisplatin was associated with either similar or 
shorter overall survival and progression-free survival, but with fewer side effects.
z For the other chemotherapy comparisons there was too little information to be able to determine the 
most effective chemotherapeutic options.
z For radiotherapy, 2-year survival rates ranged between 12% and 85% and 5-year survival rates 
varied between 2% and 82%, depending on type and location of recurrence and TNM status. For 
chemoradiotherapy, 2-year survival rates varied between 44% and 93% and 5-year survival rates varied 
between 30% and 71%.
z For radical hysterectomy, 5-year survival rates varied between 32% and 100%; for pelvic exenteration, 
5-year survival rates varied between 12% and 63%. In general, the lower survival rates were in the 
earlier case series. Pelvic exenteration had high rates of complications, when results were given.
Accuracy and effectiveness inputs to the economic evaluation
Accuracy inputs
A key question of this project was whether PET-CT imaging would be useful as routine surveillance after 
primary cervical cancer treatment was successful in asymptomatic or symptomatic patients or whether 
or not it should be used at follow-up to plan management when patients become symptomatic. The 
systematic review of accuracy studies did not yield any information on routine follow-up of asymptomatic 
patients. Therefore, the subjective elicitation was used as the base case for the economic model. The test 
accuracy study results were used within sensitivity analyses for the symptomatic branch of the model and, 
when we had both, the published test accuracy results were similar to those from the subjective elicitation.
Effectiveness inputs
Assessment of the systematic review indicated that meta-analysis was not possible in almost all treatment 
areas. Key points were to ensure that recruitment of patients and treatment given occurred later than 
1990 because of the changes in treatment since then. Other factors taken into account were the correct 
outcome measured and reported, the size of the study and the quality of the study. For some outcomes, 
little up-to-date information was available and so a pragmatic decision was made to use information from 
the best-quality studies for inputs to the economic model.
A wide range of chemotherapeutic agents was assessed in the systematic review, but not all are in current 
use. Clinical advice and the SIGN guideline3
 suggested that cisplatin used on its own would be the best 
chemotherapeutic agent to incorporate into the model. A recent IMS Oncology Analyser data set (from

October 2003 to September 2008) provides NHS clinical practice prescribing to women with recurrent or 
advanced cervical cancer (Table 54).17
Unfortunately, there were no RCTs investigating the effectiveness of cisplatin alone. The estimate of 
effectiveness was derived from an additional systematic review of cisplatin monotherapy compared with 
no treatment in any cervical cancer (as there was no evidence in recurrent cervical cancer). The methods 
and results from this systematic review can be found in Appendix 17. There was only one good-quality, 
relatively recent, RCT with a large sample size and a survival curve for ≥5 years.127 This compared cisplatin 
(40mg/m2
 weekly for 5 weeks) plus radiotherapy with radiotherapy alone in 259 women with cervical 
cancer of FIGO grades IB–IVA. The overall 5-year survival was approximately 63% in the cisplatin arm and 
59% in the no cisplatin arm (log-rank test, p=0.53) (estimate derived from enlarging survival curve to 
A3 size).

Chapter 7 Systematic review of economic 
evaluations
T
he database searches identified 409 citations. No identified studies were considered to be relevant to 
the economic evaluation of PET-CT for the diagnosis of recurrent cervical cancer.
There were six published economic evaluations that were close to being relevant,128–133 but these were 
related to the diagnosis (using other methods) and treatment options for locally advanced cervical 
cancer and for the treatment of recurrent cervical cancer. Of the four studies128–130,132 on the diagnosis 
of recurrent cervical cancer, two129,130 investigated the surveillance of squamous cell carcinoma antigen 
levels, one128 focused on routine cytological surveillance following treatment for cervical cancer and the 
other132 investigated surveillance strategies after treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Of the 
two studies131,133 related to the treatment of cervical cancer, one study’s objective was to compare the 
cost-effectiveness of various treatment options for recurrent and stage IVB carcinoma of the cervix133
and the other’s objective was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of concurrent chemoradiotherapy 
in comparison with the cost-effectiveness of radiotherapy alone in locally advanced cervical cancer.131
These six studies128–133 were reviewed in full, but no useful information was taken from them for the 
economic modelling.

Chapter 8 Economic evaluation methods and 
results
Objective
The objective of the economic evaluation was to compare the cost-effectiveness of adding PET-CT imaging 
to standard practice with MRI and/or CT with that of standard practice with MRI and/or CT alone in the 
diagnosis of recurrent or persistent cervical cancer. Currently in the UK, patients with suspected recurrence 
will undergo the following investigations:
1. history taking and clinical examination (rectovaginal and speculum examination, assessment of 
inguinal/supraclavicular lymph nodes)
2. cross-sectional imaging by MRI or CT of chest, abdomen and pelvis
3. examination under anaesthesia, histological confirmation of any vaginal vault mass by biopsy.
The economic evaluation is intended to inform current diagnostic policy for suspected recurrent 
or persistent cervical cancer, and the value of information (VOI) was intended to highlight future 
research needs.
Development of the model structure
To assess the cost-effectiveness of the various diagnostic procedures, a state transition (Markov) model was 
developed using TreeAge Pro 2011 software (TreeAge Software Inc., Williamstown, MA, USA). A Markov 
model was the appropriate modelling approach for this evaluation because the time horizons available for 
both the imaging and the interventions were relatively long and because patients changed health states or 
experienced recurrent events over a long period of time.134
In the model, two diagnostic strategies were examined:
1. clinical examination, MRI and/or CT scan (which represents the standard practice that women receive 
during follow-up assessment)
2. clinical examination, MRI and/or CT scan with the addition of a PET-CT scan.
The starting point for the patients in the model was women who have previously been treated for primary 
cervical cancer with either surgery or chemoradiotherapy based on the cancer stage that was defined at 
diagnosis (Table 55). It was assumed in the model that women who were initially diagnosed with cervical 
cancer could receive three different management strategies, based on original stage at diagnosis, current 
development of the malignancy, tumour characteristics and fitness of the patient.
At 3 months’ follow-up, if the results of the history and examination suggested the presence of 
malignancy-related abnormalities (from symptoms such as pain, vaginal bleeding, weight loss, neuropathy 
or swelling of the abdomen or legs), women will have undergone a biopsy to confirm the presence of 
persistent or recurrent cervical cancer. This means that a modelled cohort of women following a pathway 
for the detection and treatment of potential recurrent cervical cancer cannot be considered to be 
homogeneous. The accuracy of detection and the probability of treatment success in the recurrent stage 
were affected by the primary diagnosis and the treatment received previously. To address this issue, the 
same model structure was used for four separate analyses, to account for the following four cohorts of 
women based on their primary treatment:

1. women who had undergone surgery for early-stage primary cervical cancer
2. women who, in addition to surgery as per cohort 1, had postoperative chemoradiotherapy for early￾stage primary cervical cancer because of positive margins, etc.
3. women who had chemoradiotherapy for early-stage (stages I and IIA) primary cervical cancer but 
not surgery
4. women who had chemoradiotherapy for late-stage (stages IIB, III and IV) primary cervical cancer but 
not surgery.
For all cohorts of women, the clinical pathways and model structure are identical. Figure 28 shows the 
illustrative Markov model structure and the health-state transitions that are possible within the model. 
The full tree diagram is shown in Figures 37–43 in Appendix 18. Health states in the illustrative Markov 
model structure (see Figure 28) are shown in ovals and the arrows represent the transitions that can occur 
between health states. These 11 health states are described in Table 56. All women who had undergone 
treatment for primary cervical cancer will start in one of the following four groups: asymptomatic cancer at 
3 months, asymptomatic without cancer, symptomatic without cancer or symptomatic cancer at 3 months. 
The transitions are as follows:
1. asymptomatic women with cancer at 3 months will move to
i. asymptomatic recurrence
ii. symptomatic recurrence
iii. post treatment: asymptomatic cancer at 3 months
iv. death
2. asymptomatic women without cancer will remain or move to
i. asymptomatic recurrence
ii. symptomatic recurrence
iii. symptomatic without cancer
iv. death
3. symptomatic women without cancer will remain or move to
i. asymptomatic without cancer
TABLE 55 Percentages of women receiving initial treatment strategies for cervical cancer
Management Percentage of women receiving care Explanation
Surgery 30–40%a Surgery typically involves radical hysterectomy 
or trachelectomy
Of these, 70–80% are cured No further treatment needed
The remaining 20–30% of women receive 
adjuvant postoperative chemoradiotherapy 
This is because the histological examination of 
the tumour has shown positive margins or there 
are positive lymph nodes, or because of tumour 
size or volume, lymphovascular space invasion 
or stromal invasion
Chemoradiotherapy 50–60%a
Of these, 70% of the women are cured No further treatment needed
The remaining 30% of women are those who 
have not responded to first-line treatment 
(chemoradiotherapy) and may have persistent 
disease
Persistent disease can be detected at 3 months’ 
follow-up after initial course of treatment has 
finished

a potential follow-up appointment; this may 
include women who may have had cancer not

Following diagnosis of cancer at first follow-up having 
been symptomatic, women will receive new treatment 
(treatment type based on initial treatment and 
location of cancer recurrence or persistence)
Post treatment Following diagnosis of recurrent cervical cancer 
after being asymptomatic, women will receive 
new treatment (treatment type based on initial 
treatment and location of cancer recurrence or 
persistence)
Following diagnosis of recurrent cervical cancer 
after being symptomatic, women will receive new 
treatment (treatment type based on initial treatment 
and location of cancer recurrence or persistence)
Death Women may die from natural causes or may die as a result of recurrent or persistent cervical cancer
The model does not distinguish between recurrence and persistence. Women who had previously been treated for 
initial cancer with surgery and/or postoperative chemoradiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy are considered recurrent. 
Women who were originally treated with chemoradiotherapy who are detected at this stage are considered to have 
persistent disease.
Treatment for primary cancer is not included.
1. Women are followed up with examinations every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 
2 years and then annually for 1 year, with the total follow-up being 5 years.
2. Women who were symptomatic at 3 months and whose cancer has not been detected cannot 
become asymptomatic.
3. Women with symptoms that they suspect are related to cervical cancer are usually given an urgent 
appointment or their pre-existing follow-up appointment is brought forward.
4. The sensitivity and specificity of the confirmatory biopsy test were 100% accurate.
5. Women who previously received chemoradiotherapy for primary cervical cancer and who are not 
diagnosed with persistence at 3 months’ follow-up (i.e. not persistent or persistent cases missed) will 
be treated similarly to women with recurrent cervical cancer when detected.
6. The PET-CT procedure includes both the preparation and the scan of the patient; therefore, the 
preparation activity is implicit in the PET-CT scan resource use [NHS Reference Cost Team (anonymous) 
by email, pbrdatacollection@dh.gsi.gov.uk, 12 April 2011, personal communication].
7. Women who received treatment for primary cervical cancer and who have not survived at 5 years have 
died from recurrent cervical cancer only.
8. The utility for recurrent cervical cancer is equivalent to the average of the utilities for primary stage III 
and stage IV cervical cancer.
9. There is a constant hazard over 5 years for early-stage recurrent cervical cancer (i.e. the risk of 
recurrence is the same at 4 years as it is at 1 year).

10. Women treated for recurrent cervical cancer will have the same quality of life following treatment as 
they had after treatment for initial cervical cancer.
Data required for the model
Rates of recurrent cervical cancer
The model was populated with the rates of recurrent cervical cancer derived from the literature and in 
consultation with clinical experts. The rates of recurrence were calculated using a two-stage process. 
First, the survival following treatment for primary cervical cancer was derived from disease-free survival 
curves from Landoni et al.,135 progression-free survival curves from Keys et al.
136 and overall survival curves 
following initial treatment from Landoni et al.
135 and Vale et al.
137 Information from these curves was 
used with the standard assumption of an exponential survival function. Three-month survival results were 
calculated for women who received surgical treatment, based on the disease-free survival curve presented 
in Landoni et al.
135 (Figure 29). Similar procedures were used to calculate survival following postoperative 
chemoradiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy. Second, the rates of recurrence were calculated, based on the 
initial survival of women in the branch of women who were symptomatic without cancer (see probabilities 
f1–f4 in Tables 98–101 in Appendix 18), using the conditional probabilities following survival and the 
formulae presented in Table 57. Table 58 shows the rates of recurrence used in the models.
Women enter the model at 3 months after initial treatment. If they have cancer at 3 months they enter 
the state ‘Asymptomatic cancer at 3 months’ or ‘Symptomatic cancer at 3 months’, but if they are free of 
cancer at this time they enter the state ‘Asymptomatic without cancer’ or ‘Symptomatic without cancer’. 
In effect, the 3 months before entry in the model can be regarded as being represented by the probability 
tree shown in Figure 30.
Ideally, a separate data source would have been used to determine the proportions of women in each of 
these four states at the start of the model. In the absence of such a data source, it was necessary to make 
an assumption about these proportions. It was decided to use the probabilities for women moving from

the state ‘Symptomatic without cancer’ (see Tables 98–101 in Appendix 18 for probabilities f2–f4) to give 
the necessary proportions. The way this was carried out is further detailed in Table 57.
Test accuracy results
Test accuracy results used in the model were based on the values estimated in the subjective elicitation 
exercise (see Chapter 5 and Table 14). The predictive values, 95% CIs and probability distributions for MRI 
and/or CT and for PET-CT are shown in Tables 59 and 60 respectively. Using the appropriate formulae, 
predictive values were converted to sensitivities and specificities to be used in the models. Table 61 shows 
the accuracy data used in the base-case analysis. For sensitivity analysis, the uncertainty indicated in 
Tables 59 and 60 was applied to the predictive values before conversion to sensitivity and specificity.
Survival following treatment
The results used in the model for survival following treatment for recurrence or persistence are shown in 
Table 62. Survival was reported in the systematic review in Chapter 6. From the systematic review, survival 
data from studies that followed up women following treatment for recurrent cervical cancer prior to 1990 
were excluded. In cases in which 5-year survival after 1990 was not reported,96 2- and 3-year survival data 
were used. Note that these overall survival results are not given separately by the four FIGO stages.
From the results in Table 62, a weighted average of the 3-month survival following treatment was 
calculated, using weighting based on the percentages of people receiving the different treatments. 
Table 63 shows the 3-month survival data used in the models.
Costs and resources
The costs of resources used were those that were directly incurred by the NHS. Costs for clinical 
examination, diagnostic imaging (PET-CT, MRI and CT), confirmatory biopsy and treatment were included 
(Table 64). Costs that were not considered were those incurred during the primary diagnosis and 
treatment of cervical cancer. Other costs not included were those for long-term and end-of-life care. In 
the models, recurrence was assumed to occur only once. Diagnostic procedure costs were taken from 
the NHS Reference Costs 2009–2010.
139 Cost estimates for chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment 
were taken from Clark et al.,
140 and estimates for chemoradiotherapy were taken from Clark et al.140 and 
were adjusted to 2010 prices using the Hospital and Community Health Services combined pay and price 
inflation index.141 Estimated costs for the diagnosis of recurrent cervical cancer included costs for clinical 
examination, PET-CT, MRI and CT. These cost estimates were taken from the NHS Reference Costs 2009–
2010139 and published sources.141 As a result of a paucity of cost-effectiveness studies comparing PET-CT as 
an adjunct with standard practice, an additive procedural cost of PET-CT as an adjunct to standard practice 
was assumed, as shown in Table 64. All costs were adjusted to 2010 prices and were discounted at 3.5% 
per annum.

Treatment of recurrent cervical cancer depends on the site and extent of recurrence, the type of previous 
treatment received, time elapsed since primary treatment and the patient’s performance status. Treatment 
options for recurrent cervical cancer include surgery (radical hysterectomy or pelvic exenteration), 
chemoradiotherapy and palliative treatment (which can be chemoradiotherapy or radiotherapy). Treatment 
costs are presented in Table 64. In the models, a weighted mean cost of treatment was calculated 
based on the proportion of women who would receive each treatment. In model 1, for women who 
had previously received surgery for early-stage cervical cancer, treatment for recurrence was likely to be 
chemoradiotherapy in 85% of cases, exenteration in 10% of cases and chemotherapy for palliative care in 
the remaining 5%. The weighted treatment cost for model 1 was estimated at £13,011.00. In model 2, 
for women who had previously received chemoradiotherapy for early-stage cervical cancer, treatment for 
recurrence was likely to be chemotherapy alone for 80% of cases and exenteration for the remaining 20%. 
The weighted treatment cost for model 2 was estimated at £1629.85. In model 3, for women who had 
previously received chemoradiotherapy for late-stage cervical cancer, treatment for recurrence was likely 
to be chemotherapy alone in 90% of cases and pelvic exenteration for the remaining 10%. The weighted 
treatment cost for model 3 was estimated at £993.20. In model 4, for women who had previously received 
postoperative chemoradiotherapy for early-stage cervical cancer, treatment for recurrence was likely to be 
chemotherapy alone in 80% of cases and radical hysterectomy or pelvic exenteration for the remaining 
20%. The weighted treatment cost for model 4 was estimated at £1629.85. (These percentage estimates 
were obtained in personal communication with Dr S Sundar, University of Birmingham, December 2011, 
as there was no published information available.) The proportions of women receiving treatment following 
recurrent cervical cancer, with their 95% CIs and probability distributions, are provided in Tables 65–68 for 
models 1–4 respectively.

Outcomes
Three different effectiveness/outcome measures were used in the model: QALYs, recurrent case treated 
and death due to recurrent cervical cancer avoided. For the QALY calculations, utility weights for women 
who had been diagnosed with recurrent cervical cancer were obtained from Goldie et al.
143 The authors 
reported utility weights for women with invasive cancer by FIGO stage. An average weight based on 
stages III (0.56) and IV (0.48) was calculated, giving a utility for recurrent cervical cancer of 0.52. From the 
systematic review there were no studies that reported quality-of-life data following treatment for recurrent 
cervical cancer in a form that could be used in the model. It was assumed that women treated for 
recurrent cervical cancer would have the same quality of life as that following treatment for initial cervical 
cancer. Lang et al.144 measured the health-related quality of life of Taiwanese women who have been 
treated for cervical cancer – this was associated with a quality of life of 0.87. In this paper the instruments 
used to measure health-related quality of life were the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), 
Short Form questionnaire-8 items (SF-8) and the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS). In the models, the 
results of the EQ-5D were used because it is recommended by NICE as the most appropriate measure to 
calculate QALY estimates. It is also useful because its responsiveness has been shown to be equal to that of 
the European Organisation for Research in the Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire 
Core 30 (QLQ C-30) global health status measure.144 The utilities, 95% CIs and probability distributions 
used in the model are shown in Table 69.
Analysis
The recurrent cervical cancer model begins with a hypothetical cohort of women who have previously been 
treated for primary cervical cancer and who are now receiving follow-up assessment. The model estimates

the mean costs associated with the diagnostic procedure and assumes that women entering the model 
would be aged 50 years.
The model has a cycle length of 3 months. The follow-up pattern was every 3 months for 2 years and 
then twice a year for 3 years. This represents the follow-up pattern for women who were treated for initial 
cervical cancer. The model assumes a time period of 5 years; this represents the length of time that women 
are followed up after being diagnosed and treated and the time within which recurrent cervical cancer 
may be likely to occur.32
The model takes the form of a cost–utility analysis and was carried out from the UK NHS perspective in a 
secondary care setting. The primary outcome is cost per QALY, but a secondary outcome measure of cost 
per recurrent case treated was also estimated. The results of the cost–utility analysis are presented in terms 
of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
A deterministic sensitivity analysis was carried out on the 5-year survival rate for women who were 
untreated for recurrent cervical cancer (3.0%138–60%127). This wide range is because the estimate of 3% 
is from studies dated between 1906 and 1926 and it is likely that survival is now higher than this in 
untreated cervical cancer. As cervical cancer would now always be treated, it is unclear what the survival 
rate would be without treatment. The other inputs that were changed were the rates of symptomatic 
recurrence within 3 months of treatment and the utility values. Arbitrary values were used to explore the 
impact of changes on the results, given that the available data were poor. Rates of symptomatic recurrence 
within 3 months of treatment are given in Table 99 (d1=0.9778) and Table 100 (d2=0.9779) and these 
were changed to 0.9307, which is the lowest available estimate for surviving within 3 months of testing. 
The utility values used in the model were halved.
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was undertaken to determine the uncertainty in the model input 
parameters of prevalence, sensitivity and specificity, treatment costs and expected QALYs. PSA was 
carried out based on an outcome of cost per QALY only. In PSA, each model parameter was assigned 
a distribution reflecting the amount and pattern of its variation, and cost-effectiveness results were 
calculated by simultaneously selecting random values from each distribution. The process was repeated 
10,000 times in a Monte Carlo simulation of the model to give an indication of how variation in the model 
parameters led to variation in the ICERs for a given test combination.
Value of information analysis
When a decision is not robust to plausible variation in the input parameters, it is possible to estimate a 
statistic known as the expected value of perfect information (EVPI). This is determined as a function of the 
threshold ICER, which allows a conversion from QALYs to monetary value. The preferred decision under 
uncertainty is determined by maximising the mean net benefit across the distribution of input parameter 
values. For any specific parameter set that leads to the same decision, there is no value of information 
attached to those parameters. If, however, a parameter set leads to a change in the decision, then the 
value attached to that parameter set is the difference in net monetary benefit between the decision 
made under uncertainty and the decision made knowing those parameter values. The EVPI is obtained by 
calculating the value attached to each parameter set used in the PSA and averaging across all parameter 
sets, taking into account the weightings determined by the probabilistic calibration described in the 
previous section.

Results of modelling
Results in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year
The base-case deterministic results of the strategies based on the cost per QALY are presented in 
Tables 70–73. The costs are adjusted to 2009/10 prices.
Model 1: women who have been treated for early-stage cancer by surgery
The results for model 1, women who have previously received treatment by surgery for early-stage cancer, 
are presented in Table 70. Standard practice had a mean cost of approximately £9169 with corresponding 
QALYs of 4.1086 compared with a mean cost of approximately £18,757 and 4.1096 QALYs for PET-CT 
together with standard practice. The estimated ICER for PET-CT together with standard practice compared 
with standard practice alone was £9,254,000 per QALY. This indicates that, for every additional QALY 
gained from the use of PET-CT as an adjunct to standard practice, there is an incremental cost of 
£9,254,000.
Model 2: women who have been treated for early-stage cancer by 
chemoradiotherapy
The results for model 2, women who have previously received chemoradiotherapy for early-stage cancer, 
are presented in Table 71. Standard practice had a mean cost of approximately £7695 with corresponding 
QALYs of 4.1501 compared with a mean cost of approximately £17,122 and corresponding QALYs of 
4.1581 for PET-CT together with standard practice. The estimated ICER for PET-CT together with standard 
practice compared with standard practice alone was approximately £1,173,000 per QALY. This indicates 
that, for every additional QALY gained from the use of PET-CT as an adjunct to standard practice, there is 
an incremental cost of £1,173,000.
Model 3: women who have been treated for late-stage cancer by 
chemoradiotherapy and model 4: women who have been treated for early￾stage cancer by postoperative chemoradiotherapy
Similarly, for models 3 and 4, the results are presented in Tables 72 and 73 respectively. The mean 
costs for standard practice were £7612 and £7695 with QALYs of 4.1507 and 4.1501 respectively. The 
estimated ICERs for PET-CT together with standard practice compared with standard practice alone were 
approximately £1,065,000 per QALY for model 3 and £1,173,000 per QALY for model 4.

Results in terms of cost per recurrent case treated
The deterministic results for the cost per recurrent case treated were >£600,000 per case for all four 
models (Tables 74–77). In model 1 standard practice had a mean cost of approximately £9169 with 
corresponding cases treated of 0.1296 compared with a mean cost of approximately £18,757 and 
corresponding cases treated of 0.1436 for PET-CT together with standard practice. The estimated ICER 
for PET-CT together with standard practice compared with standard practice alone was £681,000 per 
case treated. This indicates that, for every additional case treated with PET-CT as an adjunct to standard 
practice, there was an incremental cost of £681,000. Similar results can be seen for models 2–4. PET-CT 
as an adjunct to standard practice was both more costly and more effective than standard practice alone, 
with an ICER of approximately £670,000 for each model.
Deterministic sensitivity analysis results
The deterministic results for the cost per recurrent case treated, presented in Tables 74–77, were 
>£600,000 per case for all four models. These results are summarised in Table 78.
Results of the probabilistic sensitivity analysis for the base-case cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year outcome
Figure 31 shows the Monte Carlo simulation for model 1. The scatterplot illustrates the uncertainty in the 
expected costs and QALYs based on PET-CT as an adjunct to standard practice compared with standard 
practice alone. For the 10,000 runs of the Monte Carlo simulation, the scatterplot shows considerable 
uncertainty about the additional expected costs and QALYs.
The scatterplots in Figures 32–35 show the uncertainty surrounding the incremental expected costs and 
incremental expected QALYs for models 1–4, respectively, based on PET-CT as an adjunct to standard 
practice in comparison with standard practice alone. In each figure, for the 10,000 runs of the Monte 
Carlo simulation, the scatterplot shows considerable uncertainty about the additional expected incremental 
costs and QALYs.
The results for model 1 are presented in the form of cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) in 
Figure 36. Analogous results were observed for models 2–4 (not shown). CEACs give the probability that 
a screening strategy is cost-effective given society’s willingness to pay for a QALY. In other words, the 
CEAC shows the probability that PET-CT as an adjunct to standard practice is cost-effective compared 
with standard practice alone at different values for society’s maximum acceptable cost-effectiveness

ratio. The threshold used by NICE is between £20,000 and £30,000 per QALY, that is, society is willing 
to pay £20,000 per QALY for 1 year of life in full health. From Figure 36 it can be seen that the use of 
PET-CT as an adjunct to standard practice alone is not likely to be cost-effective given the data used in the 
model. This is illustrated by no PET-CT (standard practice) having a probability of being cost-effective of 
approximately 100% and PET-CT (PET-CT as an adjunct to standard practice) having a probability of being 
cost-effective of approximately 0%. The implication of this result is that the VOI is necessarily zero across 
all thresholds, which means that further analysis of VOI was unnecessary.

Chapter 9 Discussion
Statement of principal findings
Test accuracy systematic review and subjective elicitation
Twelve test accuracy studies20,48–58 were found that evaluated PET-CT (n=6), MRI (n=3), CT (n=2) 
and MRI and CT (n=1) compared with histology and/or clinical follow-up. Most of the studies were 
underpowered and of poor quality. Most of the later studies evaluated PET-CT and earlier studies evaluated 
MRI and CT. Imaging practice has developed since the earlier studies so the MRI and CT studies did 
not reflect current practice standards, making it difficult to ascertain the value of PET-CT when current 
practice for CT/MRI is based on outdated research. Both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were 
to be investigated in this project, but there was very little information on imaging as routine follow-up 
for asymptomatic patients. The subjective elicitation exercise obtained the opinions of 21 clinical experts 
and the results were similar to the published estimates of accuracy for symptomatic women. There was 
information from one study comparing PET-CT and CT and/or MRI in the same patient group,49 which 
suggested that PET-CT imaging found many more true-positives and fewer false-negatives than CT or 
MRI. The subjective elicitation results suggested that the estimated increase in accuracy of adding PET-CT 
to MRI and/or CT was less than the elicited minimum important difference in accuracy required to justify 
the routine addition of PET-CT for the investigation of women after completion of primary treatment for 
cervical cancer.
Effectiveness review
Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, chemoradiotherapy and surgery (radical hysterectomy and pelvic 
exenteration) were reviewed. There were 19 RCTs60–83 on chemotherapy but none evaluated the 
effectiveness of cisplatin compared with no cisplatin, which is the most commonly used drug in recurrent 
or stage IV cervical cancer and was needed for the economic evaluation. Therefore, another review was 
carried out to find this information from a RCT. The best-quality RCT found compared cisplatin with no 
cisplatin with both groups receiving radiotherapy,127 which gave an overall 5-year survival with cisplatin 
of 63% and without cisplatin of 59%. Only case series were found on radiotherapy (nine studies84–92), 
chemoradiotherapy (seven studies93–99), radical hysterectomy (seven studies100–106) and pelvic exenteration 
(20 studies107–126). The survival rates varied considerably, depending on the date of publication, 
characteristics of patients and type of treatment given. It was noticeable that the pelvic exenteration results 
showed particularly high rates of perioperative mortality and morbidity and very low survival rates.
Economic evaluation
The results of the base-case deterministic analyses based on the outcome of cost per QALY show that 
adding PET-CT to the current treatment strategy of clinical examination, MRI and/or CT is significantly more 
costly with only a minimal increase in effectiveness. This result holds true for all four models that were 
used in the analyses to represent the alternative treatment paths that women followed for their treatment 
of primary cancer. These previous treatment paths were differentiated to ensure that the results of the 
current analysis were not influenced by previous treatment for primary cervical cancer.
The ICER for the strategy of PET-CT as an adjunct to the standard treatment strategy, which included 
clinical examination, MRI and/or CT, compared with usual treatment alone was >£1M per QALY in all 
four models:
z for women who had been treated for early-stage cancer by surgery (model 1) the ICER was £9.3M 
per QALY
z for women who had been treated for early-stage cancer by chemoradiotherapy (model 2) the ICER was 
£1.2M per QALY

NIHR Journals Library
Discussion
126
z for women who had been treated for late-stage cancer by chemoradiotherapy (model 3) the ICER was 
£1.1M per QALY
z for women who had been treated for early-stage cancer by postoperative chemoradiotherapy 
(model 4) the ICER was £1.2M per QALY.
For all models an exploration of the ICER based on the outcome of cost per additional case of recurrence 
treated was performed. For all four models, the additional cost per additional case of recurrence treated 
was in the region of £600,000 per case.
The acceptable ICER threshold used by NICE is £20,000–30,000 per QALY. This means that an ICER has to 
be below this for a technology to be currently considered cost-effective. The PSA suggests that the strategy 
of PET-CT as an adjunct to standard practice is not likely to be considered cost-effective given current 
willingness-to-pay thresholds for any of the models and data used in this analysis.
The sensitivity analysis showed that there was nothing, in terms of the data used in the models, that could 
be changed within plausible estimates, based on the current available evidence, that would change the 
direction of the results sufficiently to provide any doubt about the results of the current analysis. Thus, 
based on the current available data and expert opinion used in the models, there is little doubt that PET-CT 
as an adjunct to standard treatment has been shown to be not cost-effective in the diagnosis of recurrent 
or persistent cervical cancer at this time.
Strengths and limitations of the project
Strengths
z Well-established systematic review methods were used for this technology assessment, which lends 
considerable strength to its validity and reliability.
z Searches for the diagnostic and effectiveness studies were conducted systematically using a sensitive 
search strategy and so it is unlikely that any useful information will have been missed.
z Throughout the project the focus has been to investigate recurrent and persistent cervical cancer, 
rather than merge this evidence with that for primary cervical cancer, even if it was advanced when 
first diagnosed.
z Elicited estimates of accuracy of CT, MRI and PET-CT are plausible and reflect the fact that the accuracy 
of imaging tests is likely to be greater in symptomatic than in asymptomatic women because of the 
more advanced stage of disease in the former. Elicited estimates of accuracy also reflect a greater 
likelihood of an improvement in NPV than in PPV in both symptomatic and asymptomatic women, 
which is consistent with the probability of a larger number of false-positives with the addition of 
PET-CT to current imaging practice.
z Importantly, elicited estimates of prevalence and accuracy had face validity as judged by feedback to 
clinical experts who participated in the face-to-face elicitation exercise. Probabilities elicited with and 
without pre-elicitation training appeared similar.
z There have been four recent systematic reviews and narrative reviews on recurrent, persistent 
metastatic and advanced cervical cancer59,145–147 and all have included RCTs on advanced primary 
cancer as well as cancer after primary treatment. They all investigated chemotherapy only and so the 
current project is the only one to incorporate information on radiotherapy, chemoradiotherapy and 
surgery in the same report.
z Considerable efforts were made to find appropriate input values for the decision-analytic model, for 
example conducting an additional systematic review on the effectiveness of single-agent cisplatin in 
(recurrent or primary) cervical cancer.
z The strength of the economic evaluation is that the analysis is based on the best available data. 
Systematic reviews showed that test accuracy evidence was severely limited.
z The subjective elicitation exercise was carried out using expert opinion before any economic analysis

analysis started apart from in the sensitivity analysis. All assumptions used in the model were agreed 
by the team based on expert advice a priori.
Limitations
z There was no information on the selective use of PET-CT to guide management of patients when 
considering surgical procedures such as exenteration, as suggested in guidelines on the use of PET-CT 
in recurrent cervical cancer.
z The diagnostic systematic review is limited by the quantity and quality of the included studies. The 
studies had few participants and were underpowered and the quality was frequently poor. The 
reference standard was different for test-positive patients (histology) and test-negative patients (clinical 
follow-up) in eight of the studies.20,49–52,54–56 There was almost no information on the timing between 
the index tests and the reference standards. Also, imaging practice has changed and so the earlier 
studies do not reflect current practice; in particular, the CT and MRI studies were published between 
1981 and 2000.
z There is a weakness in test accuracy studies in which the reference standard is not independent of the 
index text. In one study,50 PET-CT was incorporated in the reference standard. For some patients the 
final diagnosis was based on the results of tumour marker level and PET-CT findings. This means that 
these studies are unlikely to give an accurate estimate of the test specificity.
z There was very little information from published studies comparing PET-CT in addition to MRI or CT 
with MRI or CT alone in order to determine whether or not PET-CT use would enhance test accuracy 
and improve therapeutic impact.
z In most of the existing studies the results for recurrent and persistent cancer, and in some cases 
(particularly RCTs) for primary advanced cervical cancer, were analysed together. When possible, results 
are presented for the subgroup of patients with recurrence and persistence only.
z There was little evidence on the effectiveness of single-agent cisplatin in recurrent or persistent cervical 
cancer, and other information required for the analysis was also scarce.
z It is debateable whether or not effectiveness evidence for patients who had undergone surgery with 
radiotherapy for their initial treatment should have been excluded. It is likely that further treatment will 
be chemotherapy. The additional systematic review on cisplatin as a single agent did not exclude these 
studies, so it is unlikely that this exclusion from the main effectiveness systematic review will have had 
any impact on the subsequent project.
z The main systematic review of effectiveness studies did not include any information on the 
effectiveness of the most commonly used chemotherapy regimen in recurrent and persistent cervical 
cancer, single-agent cisplatin.
z Effectiveness studies with long-term follow-up are the most useful but if they have a long follow-up it 
is inevitable that recruitment happened earlier and so the treatment given at the time may not be as 
effective as that given more recently. This limits the generalisability of these studies.
z The evidence on radiotherapy, chemoradiotherapy and surgery was all from case series; no RCT 
or comparative studies were available. Comparison of patient populations between studies was 
difficult because of a lack of information on baseline characteristics such as patient age, FIGO stage, 
histological cell type and site of disease. Many of the case series were published years ago (1950s 
to 1970s) and treatment effectiveness has improved over time. It is debateable whether or not the 
systematic reviews should have included these early data. However, the economic modelling required 
estimates for a number of parameters and it was not clear at the outset how early the inclusion 
criterion needed to be to find estimates for some parameters. On the one hand, basing estimates on 
early research means that they are not likely to be accurate; however, at least the parameter estimates 
are based on some research, even if early, rather than clinicians’ opinions only.
z There was no information about quality of life in recurrent and persistent cervical cancer and 
so information had to be taken from a quality-of-life study in patients with advanced primary 
cervical cancer.144
z With regards to the economic evaluation, there are some major limitations in the analysis that must 
be considered when interpreting the results. Any economic model is limited by the availability of 
suitable data to populate it. In addition to the absence of PET-CT accuracy data, which was overcome

by the use of the preference elicitation exercise data, information on the effectiveness of appropriate 
treatments was also lacking. Thus, the data for the proportions of patients receiving treatment for 
recurrent cervical cancer were again provided by clinicians based on best clinical knowledge. Utility 
data for women diagnosed with recurrent cervical data were, with the approval of the clinicians on the 
team, calculated based on the average utility values for women who had been diagnosed with stage 
III and IV primary cervical cancer. Also, utility values for women treated were based on the utility values 
from Lang et al.,144 which investigated primary cervical cancer but not recurrent or persistent cervical 
cancer. It is also worth clarifying that the data in the literature on survival did not report survival 
according to stage for women who have been treated for recurrent or persistent cervical cancer.
z When CIs were not reported in the literature, to conduct the PSA arbitrary ± ranges were used. Limited 
availability of data also meant that any correlations that may exist between the sensitivity and the 
specificity data, for the range of diagnostic tests, have been ignored.
z Cost data for tests were available in very few published studies and only unit costs for relevant 
resource use were available.
Uncertainties
There are a number of uncertainties in the results of the economic model, mainly due to uncertainties in 
the clinical parameters, such as the lack of test accuracy information for asymptomatic women. This is 
due in turn to the poor-quality evidence that is available for some parameters and the lack of evidence 
for others.
The use of differential reference standards leads to overestimation of diagnostic test accuracy.148
However, on ethical grounds, clinical follow-up is an adequate way to evaluate test accuracy in patients 
with negative findings. Unfortunately, the different definitions of clinical follow-up in each study (from 
physical and gynaecological examination during at least 6 months to tumour marker levels and imaging 
findings) are problematic because it is uncertain whether or not the different studies are measuring the 
same imaging accuracy. When clinical follow-up is used as the reference standard it is inevitable that 
the condition of the patient will change. However, if no lesions are found on imaging it is unclear where 
biopsies for histology should be taken from.
There is a risk of under- or overestimation of diagnostic test accuracy depending on the change in a 
patient’s condition, so information about the time period between the reference standard and the index 
test is important to be sure that the target condition did not change between the two tests.
With regard to the subjective elicitation, responses from individuals who received pre-elicitation education 
in the form of a lecture did not appear to differ from responses from those who did not. The data did 
not allow a formal investigation of the similarity of responses. Feedback from clinicians indicated that 
further disaggregation of women according to initial stage would have been ideal, reflecting variation in 
the prevalence of recurrence in women according to initial stage. However, this would have increased the 
number of accuracy elicitations from eight to 16 with an expected adverse impact on response rate and 
validity of responses.
Current practice in the UK does not include routine imaging surveillance of asymptomatic women post 
primary treatment for cervical cancer and therefore the elicited accuracy estimates for CT, MRI and PET-CT 
in this clinical population will not be based on the clinical experience of respondents, in contrast to the use 
of these imaging technologies in symptomatic women post primary treatment for cervical cancer. However, 
as discussed above, the pattern of estimates of accuracy in this population group is plausible given the 
lower prevalence and severity of any existing disease.
It is uncertain whether or not the addition of PET-CT is merited. One small published study49 suggested 
that PET-CT found more true-positives and fewer false-negatives than MRI and/or CT but the subjective

elicitation suggested that the increase in accuracy was less than the minimum important clinical difference 
needed. PET-CT is recommended in the SIGN guidelines when CT or MRI has demonstrated recurrent or 
persistent disease,3
 but the evidence upon which this recommendation is based is unclear.
There is considerable uncertainty around the comparative effectiveness of cisplatin monotherapy and for 
radiotherapy, chemoradiotherapy, radical hysterectomy and pelvic exenteration in recurrent and persistent 
cervical cancer. These are the mainstays of current treatment and, therefore, the lack of evidence regarding 
their effectiveness is worrying.
No studies were identified that had considered the relative cost-effectiveness of available technologies for 
the diagnosis of recurrent or persistent cervical cancer and, therefore, appropriate comparisons with other 
existing studies are not possible. Consequently, it is uncertain whether or not the approach taken here 
would be robust if other studies were conducted.
In terms of the EVPI, given that the probability calculated in the modelling never went above zero for the 
range of willingness-to-pay values plotted, the EVPI is necessarily zero at any such willingness to pay. The 
EVPI reflects the parameter uncertainty in the elicitation exercise and would be different should the test 
accuracy of PET-CT be measured directly.

Chapter 10 Conclusions
Based on the current model and given the limitations that have been highlighted in terms of availability 
of data, the results of the current analysis suggest that the use of PET-CT in the diagnosis of recurrent 
or persistent cervical cancer is not cost-effective for symptomatic or asymptomatic women. The results are 
not even close to the current willingness-to-pay thresholds that are accepted in the UK by decision-making 
bodies such as NICE. The results reflect enormous uncertainty at many levels and so a better expression of 
our current understanding is that the cost-effectiveness of PET-CT combined with usual tests and treatment 
for detecting recurrent cervical cancer is not proven. Although PSA showed that the main conclusion 
about the cost-ineffectiveness of PET-CT was firm given the range of assumptions made, should more 
reliable information become available on accuracy, therapeutic impact and effectiveness, and the cost of 
PET-CT reduce, the conclusion may need revision. Current guidelines recommending imaging for diagnosis 
using expensive methods such as PET-CT need to be reconsidered in light of the above.
Implications for service provision
z A diagnosis of recurrent cervical cancer must be an extremely distressing situation for women and their 
families. Current evidence suggests that there are huge knowledge gaps about women’s quality of life 
and survival given such a diagnosis. Also, missing an early diagnosis of recurrence is very distressing. 
Adding an additional PET-CT test to the toolkit to confirm diagnosis of recurrence, or not, might add 
something in terms of reassurance and hope. However, given that the additional accuracy of such a 
test is currently not clear, as well as the lack of other necessary evidence, a case for its implementation 
in current practice cannot yet be supported. Much more robust evidence on test accuracy, survival and 
quality of life is required before any such case can be made.
z It is uncertain whether or not the addition of PET-CT in routine surveillance of asymptomatic women 
and diagnosis of symptomatic women is good value for money, given the current state of knowledge. 
This lack of information around the usefulness of routine surveillance with PET-CT does not help the 
women concerned.
z Patients should be informed that the effectiveness of single-agent cisplatin in recurrent and persistent 
cervical cancer is uncertain.
z The pelvic exenteration results showed high operative and postoperative mortality rates and the 
complication rates were also high. Considering the morbidity of pelvic exenteration, it could be argued 
that the NHS care of these women should be further centralised into supraregional centres.
Implications for research
z The key clinical question is whether it is better to evaluate asymptomatic women following primary 
treatment or to wait until symptoms occur. A RCT could be conducted in which women who 
had completed treatment for primary cervical cancer would be randomised to a policy of routine 
surveillance or current practice of symptomatic follow-up.
z It is necessary to conduct larger, good-quality studies directly comparing the test accuracy of the 
addition of PET-CT to MRI and/or CT imaging alone in a population of women with recurrent and 
persistent cervical cancer in order to evaluate whether or not the additional expenditure on PET-CT 
is merited. Population groups need to be distinguished between symptomatic presentation and 
asymptomatic women undergoing routine follow-up.
z There is also a need to compare current practice with CT or MRI and the use of PET-CT in terms of 
change in diagnosis, work-up and change in the treatment plan by response to treatment in a way 
that permits continuation or alteration of treatment.

Conclusions
132
z To our knowledge this is the first example of the elicitation of test accuracy estimates. Use of predictive 
values and test errors resulted in consistent responses that had face validity in this sample. Further 
test accuracy elicitation exercises will be required to confirm the validity of this approach and for 
comparison of test accuracy elicitation using other test accuracy metrics.
z Investigation of the benefit of face-to-face pre-elicitation education for the validity of responses is 
warranted as this has an impact on the methods of elicitation that are possible (e.g. the use of postal￾and internet-based questionnaires), the resources required and the response rate.
z Generally, to obtain more reliable results for radiotherapy, chemoradiotherapy or surgery, there is a 
need to conduct prospective studies with a comparative group, preferably RCTs, that are sufficiently 
powered to present definitive results in the subpopulations of persistent and recurrent patients 
separately. These studies should collect information about long-term overall survival, disease-free 
status, recurrence, morbidity, hospital stay, late complications and, most importantly, generic quality 
of life using, for example, the EQ-5D, the assessment of which is crucial for the evaluation of the full 
impact of therapies on patients’ well-being.
z It would be useful to have a UK register of pelvic exenterations for recurrent/persistent cervical cancer. 
This is a major operation with considerable implications for morbidity. Our searches demonstrate 
that current published data on outcomes from pelvic exenteration for cervical cancer are outdated. In 
the systematic review most pelvic exenteration case series were published before the year 2000 and 
the only one from the UK was published in 1953.119 This makes it impossible for the effectiveness of 
diagnostic work-ups or indeed exenterative surgery to be provided accurately. Such surgery – resulting 
in the loss of the bladder and/or bowel – has the potential for significant morbidity and mortality as 
well as having an impact on the patient’s emotional well-being and body image. It is vital that we 
collect prospective good-quality data that can be used to improve care and establish standards and 
outcomes for women who require such surgery. Furthermore, this register may also help promote the 
rationalisation of service use by concentrating such services at centres that establish expertise in the 
preoperative, postoperative and long-term supportive care of these women.

Appendix 1 Protocol
Clinical effectiveness of PET-CT imaging in restaging recurrent cervical 
cancer: Systematic review of evidence and economic modelling
1. Clinical background
Cervical cancer is the most common gynaecological malignancy in the world with an estimated 493,000 
new cases diagnosed worldwide each year.1
 In the United Kingdom, approximately 2,800 patients 
are diagnosed with cervical cancer per year, accounting for around 2% of all female cancer cases2
. In 
2007 there were 941 deaths from cervical cancer which translates to a European age-standardised 
death rate of 2.4 per 100000 females. Early stage (stage 1A2–IB1) cervical cancer is treated with either 
surgery or chemo radiotherapy with equal survival rates whereas advanced stage cervical cancer (stage 
IB2–IV) is usually treated with chemo radiotherapy or chemotherapy alone3
. Survival rates depend on 
stage at presentation and histology of tumour and the all-stage five-year survival rate is 64.1%4
. The 
risk of recurrence after primary treatment depends on the extent of the primary cancer at presentation. 
Approximately 10–20% of patients with stage IB–IIA cervical cancer with negative lymph nodes will recur, 
while those with nodal metastasis or locally advanced disease have an up to 70% risk of recurrence1–3.
Recurrences can be central at the cervix or vaginal vault, pelvic in the lymph nodes of the pelvic side 
wall or distant metastases (for e.g. lung, supraclavicular lymph nodes and para aortic lymph nodes). 
Recurrences are common within the first 24 months after the initial diagnosis and can be symptomatic 
or asymptomatic. Symptom status at time of recurrence is a significant predictor of survival; the median 
survival is 11 months for symptomatic recurrence and 42 months for asymptomatic recurrence detected 
at follow-up5
. Routine clinical examination is not accurate in detecting recurrent disease as a high 
proportion of patients are found to be symptomatic at the time of detecting recurrence. Patients with 
pelvic recurrence usually present with vaginal bleeding, discharge, pelvic pain, and sciatic pain. Patient 
with disseminated recurrence will develop systemic symptoms associated with cachexia. Unfortunately 
5-year survival for recurrent or persistent cervical cancer evaluated with current imaging practices is 
between 3.2% and 13%6
. Identification of incurable metastases eliminates unnecessary salvage procedures 
and suffering, while more accurate delineation of tumour extent increases the probability of successful 
treatment. Survival with distant disease is poor3
. The key issue is to correctly identify recurrent disease that 
is amenable to curative treatment, while also correctly identifying cases for palliation.
1.1 Existing clinical practice
Currently in the United Kingdom, patients with suspected recurrence will undergo4
z clinical examination (rectovaginal and speculum examination, assessment of inguinal/ supraclavicular 
lymph nodes)
z cross sectional imaging by MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) or CT (Computed Tomography) of 
chest, abdomen and pelvis
z examination under anaesthesia, histological confirmation of any vaginal vault mass by biopsies.
In preparing this proposal, we have established that current imaging practice in England for the diagnosis 
and management of recurrence involves an MRI or CT scan of the chest or abdomen and pelvis4
. A search 
of the cancer network guidelines of practice in South West, West Midlands and Lancashire confirms that 
this is standard practice; this is also supported by the evidence based Scottish intercollegiate network 
(SIGN) guidance governing practice in Scotland. Our conceptualisation of this bid (Fig 1) is therefore an 
assessment of the effectiveness of PET-CT over current practice.

1.2 Applications of PET-CT
CT and MRI are high-resolution anatomical imaging techniques that are commonly used in cancer to 
detect potential tumours. MRI and CT are currently considered first when recurrence is suspected4
 but have 
limitations in differentiating recurrent tumour from post-radiotherapy or surgical fibrosis. CT and MRI also 
have limitations in accurately identifying the extent of recurrence as small volume metastatic nodal disease 
and distant recurrence may not be identified. They can also be unreliable in determining the presence 
or absence of recurrent disease in the pelvis after radiotherapy as radiotherapy induced fibrosis makes 
tissues indurated thus potentially concealing recurrent disease. Incomplete excision of disease is associated 
with significantly reduced survival after surgery. Similarly, CT and MRI may not identify disease spread to 
regional and distant lymph nodes and other organ sites.
PET is an imaging method that can be used to establish the functional parameters of tissue allowing it to 
detect metabolically active tumours.7 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) is the most widely used radiotracer 
in the management of cancer patients. It is a glucose analogue and is taken up and actively trapped in 
the enhanced glycolytic pathway of cancer cells in particular. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging 
utilises a coincidence camera system to detect the high energy photons emitted as a result of annihilation 
of positrons emitted by the radioisotope with nearby negatively charged electrons, thus providing 
anatomical localisation of the source i.e. area of pharmaceutical accumulation. PET provides anatomical 
image resolution of the order of 4–6mm, significantly better than conventional gamma-cameras, but 
inferior to the 1–2-mm resolution of CT or MRI. The size of lesion that can be detected by PET is limited by 
several factors, including the physics of positron emission, the spatial resolution of the scanner (typically 
4.5–6mm in the centre of the axial field) and safe dosing limits of 18F-FDG.7
 PET-CT precisely aligns and 
combines metabolic PET mages with anatomical CT images obtained immediately consecutively on the 
same machine without patient movement, and is being increasingly preferred over PET scanning alone – 
almost universally, as it allows precise localisation of active disease foci and recognition of normal variants.
The combination of PET-CT rather than PET alone is therefore used in cervical cancer in order to overcome 
limitations of either neuro-imaging technology alone. PET-CT detects metabolically active disease in 
primary tumours and metastatic lesions, and can demonstrate disease in normal sized nodes, and in post 
surgical or radiotherapy fibrosis. False positives are recognised following radiation and surgery as a result 
of radiotherapy and surgery induced inflammation and the general advice is to wait for 3 to 6 months 
after treatment. False positives can also occur in sepsis that cannot be always differentiated by PET-CT. 
False-negatives can also occur soon after chemotherapy and the advice is preferably to wait for 6 weeks 
with a minimum of 2 weeks. After allowing for important treatment effects, the detection capability of 
PET-CT is believed to be similar for detection of primary lesion and recurrence of tumour.
The applications of PET-CT in cervical cancer patients include: identification of persistent/recurrent disease, 
assessing local tumour extension, evaluating pelvic nodal involvement, detection of distant metastases (for 
example lung, supraclavicular lymph nodes and para-aortic lymph nodes, radiation therapy planning (in 
patients with PET scans positive for lymph nodes) and in assessing response to therapy8
.
1.3 Current treatment options for management of recurrent cervical cancer
Treatment of recurrent cervical cancer depends upon the site (central, pelvic, distant), extent of recurrence, 
type of previous treatment received (surgery, chemoradiation, radiation), time elapsed since primary 
treatment and the patient’s performance status. Treatment is usually curative or palliative in intent. 
Potentially curative disease is defined as a) confirmed recurrent disease confined to the pelvis, if the patient 
had not received previous primary or adjuvant pelvic RT (Radiotherapy) b) disease confined to the central 
pelvis, without pelvic side wall or extrapelvic involvement, if RT had been administered before recurrence 
c) distant recurrences at a single site (such as para aortic lymph node ) that could be completely resected 
or encompassed by a curative RT procedure9
. The treatment is palliative in intent if distant or multiple site 
recurrence. It is critical that the therapeutic intent (curative or palliative) is preceded by accurate diagnosis.

The treatment options for recurrent cervical cancer varies according to the mode of treatment provided for 
primary cervical cancer and the extent of recurrence.
1.3.1 Previous surgical treatment:
In women who have had primary radical surgery and who have had a pelvic relapse, radiation is the 
treatment of choice3
. This project will evaluate any evidence on whether early diagnosis of persistent 
or recurrent disease influences outcomes and whether clearly defining the extent of disease influences 
management and patient outcomes.
1.3.2 Previous chemoradiation or radiation only:
Salvage surgery is generally considered in women who have undergone chemoradiation or radiation 
treatment alone as primary treatment for cervical cancer and who have evidence of localised recurrence 
and surgery has a high chance of completely removing the disease4
. Surgery for relapsed disease after 
radiation therapy is often associated with high morbidity as radiation fibrosis makes surgery difficult and 
to enhance cure rates surgical excision of disease often involves removal of bladder, uterus, cervix, and 
various amounts of the vagina (anterior exenteration) or uterus, vagina and portions of the rectosigmoid 
colon and anus (posterior exenteration) or a complete pelvic clearance (exenteration). In a small number 
of patients radical hysterectomy will suffice, if the disease is highly localised. As exenterations are 
morbid surgical procedures resulting in alteration of body image, patients require extensive preoperative 
psychosocial counselling.
The evidence base for outcomes after exenterative surgery is based on retrospective case series since the 
first advocate of this surgery by Alexander Brunschwig in 1946. With appropriate selection of patients, 
better pre- and postoperative care and improved operative techniques, the operative mortality varies from 
16% to 2%7–8. The 5-year survival of patients treated with pelvic exenteration is around 30%–60%8,10,11. 
Many of these reports vary in case selection, operative philosophy and technique. The objective of 
this aspect of the project will be to identify all published reports of salvage surgery after radiation and 
chemoradiation therapy for cervical cancer. Reports that include surgery for recurrent disease from other 
organs will be excluded. We will also endeavour to contact all cancer centres in the UK in case unpublished 
audits of salvage surgery have been undertaken. Once the evidence base has been established, we will 
endeavour to identify the optimum surgical approach from the evidence and quantify short and long 
term outcomes.
1.3.3 Early Palliative Treatment
For multiple site or distant recurrence, chemotherapy can be administered with a palliative intent. 
Treatment options must be balanced with good supportive care and often palliative care alone is 
appropriate to maintain quality of life towards the end of life. The project team will also review 
the evidence if early recognition of unresectable persistent or recurrent disease by imaging after 
chemoradiation influences patient outcomes.
2. Work leading to the proposal
We have conducted systematic reviews of accuracy PET, CT and MRI in primary cervical cancer staging 
with respect to diagnosis of lymphadenopathy through an MRC research training fellowship awarded 
under Prof Khalid Khan’s supervision. In particular we have developed test accuracy studies comparing 
PET-CT and sentinel node technique with current imaging standards of CT and MRI to detect lymph node 
metastases in cervical cancer12. In our work, we have developed literature searching, data extraction 
procedures, and analytic strategies for this topic. We are familiar with the literature and the gaps therein.
There are only a few attempts to incorporate test accuracy evidence into therapeutic decision-making in 
cancer research. We have identified the need for and developed a decision analytical model for managing 
patients with vulval cancer which incorporates the accuracy of imaging techniques with the therapeutic

evidence. A summary of data on accuracy of PET, CT and MRI for accurately staging primary cervical cancer 
from our published review is provided in Appendix 1.
We have also developed analytical techniques to compensate for the absence of gold standard 
histopathology for verification of test accuracy previously13. We are now in a position to use the above 
as the basis for developing a robust decision analytic model for recurrent cervical cancer. We have also 
conducted model based health economics evaluations in obstetrics using output from systematic review14. 
Therefore, we welcome the opportunity to bid for this call for proposals, which will allow us to consolidate 
and advance the work we have already undertaken in this field.
We are confident that given our knowledge and expertise in the relevant clinical and methodological fields, 
we can with appropriate resources, deliver a high quality HTA report.
3. Research Objectives
The commissioning brief is for an evidence synthesis of the added value of PET/CT for restaging women 
with recurrent cervical cancer. Our project will follow the key steps involved in health technology 
assessment and will meet the commissioned brief by fulfilling the following objectives:

1. To determine the diagnostic accuracy of PET-CT compared to CT or MRI (current imaging) in 
women with suspected or confirmed recurrent cervical cancer in identifying (restaging) locoregional 
recurrence, nodal and distant metastasis
2. To evaluate the diagnostic impact of PET-CT resulting in change in diagnosis or restaging compared to 
CT or MRI
3. To assess the therapeutic impact of PET-CT in changing planned treatment improving mortality and 
morbidity through systematic review of effectiveness of various interventions (surgery, radiotherapy, 
chemotherapy, early palliative care) in the management of recurrent cervical cancer detected by 
current practice (CT or MRI) and PET-CT
4. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using PET-CT (in addition to standard practice) for the detection 
and restaging of recurrent disease and treatment response assessment and consequent treatment 
strategies in terms of both human and financial costs using decision-analytic modelling.
5. To identify groups of women with recurrent cervical cancer in whom it is possible to undertake future 
powerful trials of interventions to reduce mortality and morbidity, and to identify key areas and 
research questions requiring further primary research (in addition to identifying areas where evidence 
is strong enough to generate recommendations for clinical practice) using Value Of Information (VOI) 
analysis.
The relationship of our objectives to the clinical process is shown in Fig 1.
4. Relevance to Commissioning Brief
The title of the HTA commissioning brief (09/29) refers to ‘The added value of PET-CT for restaging in 
recurrent cervical cancer’. It goes on to include the following in the scope of the work to be carried out: 
effect of staging on treatment planned, decision analysis and cost effectiveness of added value of PET-CT 
compared to current imaging practice. From this, we take it that the scope of the work is to be broad.
There is substantial literature on the diagnostic accuracy of PET-CT in primary diagnosis of cervical cancer 
but literature on recurrent disease is limited. In order to determine the value of PET-CT, information on 
diagnostic accuracy alone will not be sufficient. In addition information on diagnostic impact, therapeutic 
and patient outcomes will be needed. Thus, it is crucial to review effectiveness of various interventions in 
patients with recurrent cervical cancer in addition to accuracy of PET-CT and CT or MRI (current practice) 
in restaging to inform decision analytic modelling. The project team’s interpretation of the scope of 
this commissioning brief is the added value of PET-CT in restaging in recurrent cervical cancer and not 
detection of recurrence alone. However the added value of PET-CT in detecting recurrence in asymptomatic 
women is being promoted as recommended best practice4
 and the project team propose broadening the 
scope to include an assessment of the added value of PET-CT as surveillance for asymptomatic patients. 
Surveillance populations will be restricted to patients with advanced stage cervical cancer (IB2–IV) 
treated previously with chemoradiation as a sub-group in whom recurrence is most likely. We will obtain 
information on the treatment for primary cervical cancer for modelling as the mode of initial treatment will 
influence the accuracy of the test and subsequent treatment for recurrence.
We believe that it is feasible to undertake this work within the time scale with the resources we have 
requested. Our team has the necessary experience and expertise for fulfilling all the requirements in the 
HTA brief. We have a very strong, internationally renowned, group knowledgeable in systematic reviews 
of diagnostic and effectiveness data and in economic modelling. We have recently undertaken a large 
number of reviews for tests and treatments in cancer including primary cervical cancer and have developed 
a decision-making framework12,15,16. This background provides the basis for us to rapidly undertake the 
review work and the modelling within the time constraints specified in the brief.

5. Plan of research
The plan of research will be to undertake a novel systematic review of the accuracy of PET-CT in recurrent 
cervical cancer and a systematic review of the effectiveness of treatments for recurrent cervical cancer. 
Simultaneously a decision analytic model will be developed and additional rapid systematic reviews will be 
undertaken as necessary to populate the emerging model. A scoping search of the literature on the test 
accuracy of PET-CT has been undertaken. This has identified 2 reviews in the literature at various levels of 
currency (2004–2005)17,18. Searches for these 2 reviews were conducted in 2004 and 2005 respectively and 
yielded a total of 14 citations of potential relevance to the assessment of accuracy of PET-CT in recurrent 
cervical cancer. On this basis we expect the volume of test accuracy literature to be small and we therefore 
propose to include triangulation of subjective probabilities of test accuracy elicited from clinical experts 
and information on the test accuracy of PET-CT in primary cervical cancer where appropriate12.
This project team will address the following structured question:
Population
1. Clinical suspicion of recurrence: women suspected to have persistent or recurrent cervical cancer after 
primary treatment, on the basis of one or more of clinical history, clinical examination, tests (including 
imaging and histology).
2. Surveillance in asymptomatic patients: patients with advanced stage cervical cancer (IB2–IV) treated 
previously with chemoradiation with a minimum gap between completion of treatment and imaging 
of 3 months.
Tests
PET-CT using FDG in addition to current imaging (CT or MRI) in comparison with current practice (CT or 
MRI) alone.
Reference standard
Disease status determined by histopathological findings, clinical follow up.
Interventions
Surgery, chemo radiation, radiation, palliative treatment.
Outcomes
Test accuracy: confirmation of stage of recurrence; incremental accuracy above existing tests in identifying 
potentially curable disease.
Diagnostic impact: change in diagnosis and/or staging after PET-CT compared to existing tests.
Therapeutic impact: change in treatment plan after PET-CT compared to existing tests by response to 
treatment that permits continuation or alteration of treatment.
Patient outcomes: morbidity, mortality, Quality of Life.
Costs: Use of resources.
Study design
Test accuracy studies.
Diagnostic before after studies investigating diagnostic and therapeutic impact with or without concurrent 
assessment of test accuracy.
Randomised controlled trials and non randomised controlled studies assessing effectiveness 
of interventions.
Economic evaluations.

Exclusions
Women within 3 months of completion of treatment for primary disease due to the problems associated 
with distinguishing treatment complications such as oedema and inflammatory response from recurrence 
in this patient group.
Systematic reviews of test accuracy, diagnostic and therapeutic impact and effectiveness will be carried out 
using established systematic review methodology in line with the recommendations of the NHS Centre for 
Reviews and Dissemination and the Cochrane Collaboration including those of Cochrane Methods Working 
Group on Screening and Diagnostic tests19,20. The systematic review of diagnostic test accuracy will be 
registered as a Cochrane review and as such will receive support from the Cochrane Methods Working 
Group on Screening and Diagnostic Tests based at the University of Birmingham. Inclusion, data extraction 
and quality assessment will be carried out in duplicate with differences resolved by consensus and/or 
arbitration involving a third reviewer.
5.1 Reviews of diagnostic studies
5.1.1 Study identification and selection
Evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of PET-CT, diagnostic impact of PET-CT and therapeutic impact 
of PET-CT in recurrent cervical cancer will be identified from a database of published and unpublished 
literature which will be assembled. Language restrictions will not be applied to electronic searches. The 
following databases will be searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, and Cochrane Database 
of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Database of 
Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) and Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA). MEDION 
database has not been updated since 1998 and so would be irrelevant in these update searches. 
Information on studies in progress, unpublished research or research reported in the grey literature 
will be sought by searching a range of relevant databases including Clinical Trials.com and UK Clinical 
Research Network Portfolio. A draft MEDLINE strategy is included in Appendix 2. This strategy was devised 
in consultation with the information specialist at the Cochrane Methods Working Group on Screening 
and Diagnostic tests and consideration of the strategy compiled by Mijnhout21. Electronic searches will 
be supplemented by hand searching, contacting manufacturers and consultation with experts in the 
area. In addition authors of included studies will be contacted for information on relevant published or 
unpublished studies. Citations identified by the search will be selected for inclusion in the review in a 
two-stage process using predefined and explicit criteria regarding populations, tests, outcomes and study 
design. These criteria will be pilot tested using a sample of papers and agreement between reviewers will 
be measured.
Due to anticipated small numbers of studies we also plan to update existing reviews of the accuracy 
of PET-CT in primary cervical cancer using the search strategy outlined above, removing the terms for 
recurrent cervical cancer.
5.1.2 Study quality assessment and data extraction
Methodological quality of the selected primary studies will be assessed based on elements of study design, 
conduct and analysis included in a validated assessment tool, QUADAS, which will be adapted to the topic 
area as necessary22. No quality assessment tool exists for the assessment of diagnostic before after studies 
but members of the project team have experience of devising quality checklists for this particular study 
design based on existing knowledge in the area23. Data extraction will be performed using pre-designed, 
piloted data extraction forms, drawing on existing pro-formas used by the project team in previous, 
completed reviews in the topic area12. Missing information will be obtained from investigators if is crucial 
to subsequent stages of analysis and modelling. To avoid introducing bias, unpublished information will be 
treated in the same fashion as published information. In addition to using double data extraction to ensure 
the reproducibility of the overview, sensitivity analyses around important or questionable judgements 
regarding quality assessment and data extraction will be performed.

5.1.3 Data synthesis
Sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios for individual studies comparing PET-CT and current imaging 
methods (CT or MRI) will be derived. Presence of a threshold effect will be examined by plotting sensitivity 
against 1–specificity in a receiver operating-characteristic analysis (ROC analysis) and by calculating 
Spearman correlation coefficients24. Heterogeneity of results between studies will be investigated 
qualitatively by examining the distribution of sensitivities and specificities in (ROC) space and variability of 
estimates of diagnostic odds ratios (DOR) across studies using the forest plot24. In addition heterogeneity 
will be investigated quantitatively using meta-regression and subgroup analyses if the volume of studies 
allow. Multivariable analysis will be undertaken to identify those criteria that have the most effect on our 
data set. Quantitative investigation will be undertaken based on variables defined a priori and including 
population characteristics, index and reference test characteristics and study quality25. It is anticipated that 
the following will be important sources of variation in test accuracy estimates:
z Population characteristics: initial staging of primary tumour, primary treatment received, interval 
between initial treatment and recurrence, symptomatic and asymptomatic recurrence.
z Index test characteristics: technical details of the PET CT scanner including imaging methodology and 
sequences used, skill and experience of the operator, healthcare setting (2y or 3y), timing of scan post 
injection of tracer, does of tracer used.
z Reference test: histology or clinical follow up.
z Study quality: study design (prospective or case–control) and study quality (high: meeting all 
assessment criteria; medium: meeting at least one assessment criteria; low: meeting no quality 
criteria). High quality studies will be used as the reference category to determine whether medium and 
low quality studies have biased estimates of test accuracy.
Based on an investigation of heterogeneity summary estimates of sensitivity, specificity and likelihood 
ratios (LRs), and summary ROC curves will be derived as appropriate using recognised methods for meta￾analysis of test accuracy26. Direct comparisons are more robust and will be distinguished from indirect 
comparisons27,28. LRs are considered more clinically meaningful as measures of test accuracy and they 
allow estimation of probabilities for economic modelling. Post test probabilities can be used to tailor the 
absolute effectiveness estimates according to test results.
The risk of publication and related biases is expected to be high in reviews of test accuracy29,30. Publication 
bias will be investigated using funnel plots of DOR against corresponding variances. Qualitative 
investigation will be based on the premise that large gaps in the funnel indicate possible ‘missing’ 
publications. These omissions are usually due to small studies showing limited accuracy and are unlikely to 
be missing at random. Statistical investigation of publication bias will be undertaken in STATA based on 
templates of commands and instructions already developed by the project team.
5.2 Reviews of effectiveness of interventions
Once accurate imaging modality has identified the women with potentially curable disease by restaging, 
these patients may benefit from interventions effective in reducing mortality and morbidity. Existing 
reviews will be assessed for their quality and currency follow existing guidelines QUOROM and MOOSE30,31. 
Through this process we will identify gaps where reviews do not exist and where they need updating. 
Where necessary effectiveness reviews of RCTs of treatments for recurrent cervical cancer will be 
undertaken follow existing guidelines32 ensuring the output complies with the QUOROM statement30.
5.2.1 Study identification and selection
For evidence on the of effectiveness of treatments for recurrent cervical cancer we will begin by searching 
for exiting systematic reviews using the ARIF search protocol33. Any existing reviews will be examined 
for relevance and currency in order to inform further searching for primary studies. Searches for further 
primary studies will be performed. The following databases will be searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science 
Citation Index and the Cochrane Library (all databases). On-going studies will be sought by searching 
Clinical Trials.com and the UK Clinical Research Network portfolio. Draft searches for MEDLINE are included

in Appendix 2. Studies will be selected for inclusion in the review in a two-stage process using predefined 
and explicit criteria regarding populations, interventions and outcomes using procedures similar to the 
ones outlined in the previous section 5.1.1.
5.2.2 Study quality assessment and data extraction
The quality of included reviews will be assessed against a validated tool and a reporting checklist, 
QUOROM30. Methodological quality of randomised and non-randomised trials will be assessed based on 
accepted criteria. Information on the adequacy of randomisation, sequence generation, concealment, 
blinding, description of withdrawals, and follow-up rates would be sought as these are elements most 
likely to have a direct relationship to bias in a RCT34. Procedures for obtaining missing information and 
resolving disagreements will be similar to the ones outlined in section 5.2.1.
5.2.3 Data synthesis
Revman and Stata softwares will be used to conduct analyses. The former will allow uniformity with 
Cochrane reviews and the latter will allow the data analytic flexibility that we will need to examine issues 
not included in the Revman software. Heterogeneity of results between studies and investigation for 
publication bias will be statistically and graphically assessed using methods outlined in section 5.1.3. 
The decision to proceed to meta-analysis will depend on the degree of heterogeneity in the data set. It is 
anticipated that the following will be important sources of variation in the estimates of effectiveness:
z Population characteristics: initial staging of primary tumour, primary treatment received, interval 
between initial treatment and recurrence, symptomatic and asymptomatic recurrence, extent of 
recurrence, physical performance status of patient.
z Treatment characteristics: Type of intervention (surgery, radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy), 
intention of treatment (curative or palliative) duration of therapy, healthcare setting (2y or 3y), timing 
of intervention.
z Outcome measures: Mortality, morbidity, Quality of life.
Conclusions regarding the typical estimate of an effect size of the intervention will be interpreted 
cautiously if there is significant heterogeneity.
5.3 Eliciting subjective probabilities
In anticipation of small numbers of test accuracy studies subjective probabilities will be elicited, using 
a group interview, from between 10 and 15 clinical experts in the fields of gynaecological cancer and 
radiology with no conflict of interest in the area, identified by clinicians in the project team and project 
advisors. The aim of the elicitation process will be to gather subjective views about the size and probability 
of incremental changes in test accuracy (true positives, false positives, true negatives and false negatives) 
from the addition of PET-CT to current imaging practice in the detection (surveillance in asymptomatic 
women) and restaging of recurrent cervical cancer.
Subjective probability estimates will be elicited concerning:
z The diagnostic accuracy of the addition of PET CT to current imaging practice (CT or MRI) and current 
imaging practice alone in recurrent cervical cancer.
z The diagnostic impact of the addition of PET CT to current imaging practice in recurrent cervical cancer 
(changes in diagnosis and treatment planning).
z The therapeutic impact of the addition of PET CT to current imaging practice in recurrent cervical 
cancer (the effects of changes in treatment).
Eliciting subjective probabilities from clinicians has three roles:
1. Providing data to populate the economic model in the absence of information found in the literature.

NIHR Journals Library
Appendix 1
154
2. Supplementing information found in the literature. Literature may be sparse, of poor quality or 
not transferable to the UK setting. Information gained from clinicians in the form of subjective 
probabilities may be used to supplement information found in the literature to enable sensitivity 
analyses to be performed as part of the economic model. For example subjective estimates of the 
therapeutic impact of the addition of PET-CT from clinicians in the UK may be different to results 
obtained by combining test accuracy and effectiveness evidence estimated in research settings 
(effectiveness versus efficacy).
3. Planning the dissemination strategy for the results of the research. If it is not possible for clinicians to 
reach agreement about their subjective estimates of the accuracy, diagnostic impact and therapeutic 
impact of PET-CT this information can be useful when developing a dissemination plan for this 
research project.
The process of eliciting probabilities
Subjective probabilities will be elicited using group interviews with between 10 and 15 clinical experts 
in the fields of gynaecology, oncology and radiology with no conflict of interest in the area. Experts 
will be identified by clinicians in the project team and project advisors. Based on experience of eliciting 
probabilities in other clinical topics it is anticipated that 2, half day interviews or one whole day 
interview will be necessary to elicit all the required information: test accuracy, diagnostic impact and 
therapeutic impact.
A face-face group interview (behavioural aggregation) will be used in preference to individual interviews as 
this facilitates a common understanding of the problem and task from experts and will allow us to benefit 
from group discussion and interaction leading to a consensus of opinion35. The expert group will be 
facilitated by both a clinical and non-clinical expert drawn from the project team with sufficient statistical 
expertise to provide probabilistic training to experts, validate their results and provide feedback. The expert 
group interview(s) will be facilitated by both a clinical and non-clinical expert drawn from the project team 
with sufficient statistical expertise to provide probabilistic training to experts, validate their results and 
provide feedback. The interview(s) will briefly comprise:
z Training of experts (probability, probability distributions, judgement heuristics and biases)
z Practising elicitations
In this part of the workshop participants will be presented with a non-related topic to allow evaluation 
of their understanding of the task to be completed (subjective probability estimates of the accuracy, 
diagnostic impact and therapeutic impact of the addition of PET-CT in recurrent cervical cancer) and a 
rehearsal of the process. In addition the results of the practice example will be fed back to participants to 
demonstrate how the outcome of the workshop will be integrated with the findings from the systematic 
review. Attachment: practice probabilities.xls provides an example of a practice elicitation exercise used 
successfully in previous research with clinicians.
Eliciting probabilities about the use of PET-CT in recurrent cervical cancer
Following completion of the practice exercise participants will be asked to provide separately their 
subjective estimates of the size and probability of test accuracy outcomes, diagnostic impact outcomes 
and therapeutic impact outcomes. The following sections detail how subjective probabilities about test 
accuracy will be elicited as an illustrative example. Participants will be presented with the prevalence of 
recurrent cervical cancer in the population of interest (the prior probability of having recurrent cervical 
cancer). The probability of recurrent cervical cancer will be modified by the results of the test(s) under 
investigation: CT or MRI versus CT or MRI and PET-CT. Respondents will be asked for their subjective 
estimates of the accuracy (expressed as the probability of true positives (TP) and true negatives (TN)) for 
each of the tests/test combinations under investigation. Uncertainty regarding estimates of test accuracy 
will result in a distribution of possible test accuracy estimates instead of a precise figure (see Appendix 3 in 
the illustrative example below). In Appendix 5 Tables 1–3 in the illustrative example a range of probabilities 
between 50 and 100% have been used. In practise in the workshop we plan to begin by asking

155
respondents for their single most likely estimates of TP and TN and then present a range of probabilities 
around these estimates.
Presentation of results back to experts.
It is planned that the elicitation of subjective probabilities will be a paper based exercise and results will 
be analysed immediately following the elicitation exercise. In previous research it has been possible to 
analyse results from small numbers of participants in the period of one hour. The subjective probabilities 
of all participants will be combined and fed-back to participants. A combined probability distribution 
will be constructed (for example, see Appendix 3) by summing the frequency of points awarded to each 
probability presented to participants and presenting this graphically. If there is substantial disagreement 
within the group, individual subjective estimates will be presented and examination of agreement 
within sub-groups of respondents, for example according to speciality will be explored (for example see 
Appendix 4 in the illustrative example).
Repeat elicitation of probabilities
The elicitation process will be repeated following feedback of results from round 1 to ensure reliability. 
In the event of substantial variation suggesting construction of a combined probability would be 
inappropriate, a repeat of the exercise may result in greater agreement. In the event that it is not possible 
to construct a combined probability distribution for participants the degree of variability of estimates of 
test accuracy, diagnostic impact and therapeutic impact will be useful in informing the dissemination 
strategy for the results of the research.
Updating the prior probability of disease (prevalence) using subjective 
probabilities and findings from the systematic review
The probability of disease prior to testing (prevalence of cervical cancer) will be updated using the 
combined test accuracy distribution derived from respondents using a Bayesian updating formula to 
produce a posterior distribution of disease probability. This posterior distribution of disease derived from 
the elicitation process will be further updated with the results of the systematic review, again using a 
Bayesian updating formula to provide a final posterior distribution for use in probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis. In the event that it is not possible to derive a combined probability distribution from respondents 
the prior probability of disease (prevalence) will be updated using estimates from the systematic 
review only.
The elicitation process also aims to generate subjective probabilities concerning the diagnostic and 
therapeutic impact of the addition of PET-CT. Findings from the elicitation process will be triangulated with 
findings from the systematic reviews and probability distributions will assist with populating the decision 
analytic model. As well as expertise within the project team36 we have access to experts in the field, based 
at the University of Birmingham37.
5.4 Model Based Economic Evaluation
The objective of the economic evaluation is to compare the relative cost effectiveness of adding PET-CT 
imaging as an adjunct to standard practice against standard practice alone in re-staging recurrent 
cervical cancer.
5.4.1 Perspective and data collection
If PET-CT screening is shown to be an effective adjunct to the standard practice in re-staging recurrent 
cervical cancer then it is likely that important cost implications will be imposed on the health care sector. 
For example, PET-CT may detect additional evidence of the extent of metastasis compared to standard 
investigations which could increase the number and extent of subsequent tests and treatment required 
by the individual. But the additional associated costs associated with more accurate re-staging of the 
re-current cancer may lead to a reduction in costs associated with unnecessary or ineffective subsequent 
treatments and also prolong the life of the woman. Thus, if available data allow, the economic evaluation 

NIHR Journals Library
Appendix 1
156
will be based on an outcome of cost per QALY and/or Cost per recurrent case treated; and/or cost per 
‘death due to recurrent cancer’ avoided. The analysis will adopt the perspective of the NHS.
Therefore data collection required for the model based economic evaluation will include:
z The equipment, other resource use and costs associated with PET-CT
z Knock-on costs associated with further tests and treatments that are required as a result of the 
re-staging
z Equipment, resource use and costs associated with current practice
z Accuracy of the PET-CT test and current practice package compared to the accuracy of current practice 
tests alone
z Effectiveness of alternative intervention pathways that are followed as a result of the diagnosis
z Outcomes such as quality of life associated with cervical cancer at various disease stages; probability of 
death associated with various stages of the disease diagnosed.
A scoping search has already been undertaken to identify economic evaluations of cervical cancer. This 
search used terms for ‘cervical cancer’ in conjunction with an economic search filter in MEDLINE. The 
search identified 360 references. A systematic search for economic evaluations and any other data 
needed to populate the model will be undertaken in NHS EED, MEDLINE and EMBASE. The objective of 
searching the economic literature is to identify studies reporting costs and consequences associated with 
recurrent cervical cancer, which will provide estimates for a comparison with current practice. The review 
of economic studies will also try to identify quality-of-life information that could be used to estimate the 
proposed outcome of cost per QALY although our initial scoping search has not found many studies of this 
type. If relevant QALY data is unavailable for this type of recurrent cancer we will infer QALY values from 
other cancer studies.
Cost data will be collected from two principal sources. First, once the clinical evidence has been synthesised 
into the main strategies of diagnosis and treatment, relevant studies will be examined for their data on 
costs and resource use. These data will be subject to relevant quality criteria. Additional cost data will be 
available from other sources such as the National Schedule for Reference Costs. If necessary, primary cost 
and resource data will be collected from the Pan-Birmingham Gynaecology Cancer Network to complete 
any gaps in the information required for the modelling process.
Additional searches will be undertaken to help populate the decision model. The Information Specialist 
will work in close liaison with the health economist to identify the model questions. Information to answer 
these questions will be provided by focused searching of appropriate databases, including reference cost 
databases, statistical sources and other sources of relevant information.
The evidence found in the clinical accuracy and effectiveness reviews will provide the majority of the 
parameters required to carry out the economic evaluations of alternative test and treat packages. If 
information on the correlation between a package of tests and correlation between a package of 
treatments is available from the reviews, the framework will allow these more complex strategies to be 
evaluated as well as strategies that allow alteration in the form of repeated testing.
5.4.2 Model and analysis
The economic evaluation will involve the development of a decision analytic simulation model as a 
framework for conducting cost-effectiveness and associated value of information analyses38,39. The 
economic evaluations will inform current treatment policy in this clinical area, whilst the value of 
information component will serve to highlight future research needs and agendas, and inform possible 
future research funding decisions. A modelling framework is ideally suited to demonstrate and explore the 
importance of the inherent uncertainty.

The risk of recurrence after primary treatment depends on the extent of primary cancer at presentation. 
Treatment of recurrent cervical cancer depends on the site and extent of recurrence, the type of previous 
treatment received, time elapsed since primary treatment and the patient’s performance status. A Markov 
model is the appropriate modelling approach for this evaluation because the time horizons available 
for both the imaging and the interventions are relatively long. Markov models are also able to represent 
clinical situations where patients change health states or experience recurrent events over a long period of 
time40. The Markov model will be constructed using TreeAge Pro software. This is a widely-used and highly 
user-friendly package ideally suited to the construction and analysis of decision trees and Markov models.
An incremental approach will be adopted with a focus on additional costs and gain in benefits associated 
with a move away from current practice to alternative test and treatment strategies. Using discounting, 
adjustments will be made to reflect the differential timing of costs and outcomes in terms of the extension 
to the length of life extend associated with the test and treat strategies. The base-case analysis will follow 
Treasury recommendations for public sector projects.
5.4.3 Presentation of results and sensitivity analysis
The results of these economic analyses will be presented using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves to 
reflect sampling variation and uncertainties in the appropriate threshold cost-effectiveness values.
For the Value of Information analysis we shall quantify the total uncertainty in terms of the value 
of removing that uncertainty. As appropriate, we shall include partial value of information analysis 
calculations. We shall also use both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to explore the 
robustness of these results to plausible variations in key assumptions and variations in the analytical 
methods used, and to consider the broader issue of the generalisability of the results.

includes development of a tool for assessment of quality in diagnostic before–after studies, identification 
of reviews of test accuracy and she is nearing the end of a programme of doctoral research concerned 
with communication of test accuracy outcome measures and evaluation of their diagnostic impact. AF has 
extensive experience as an information specialist in providing support to a diagnostic and effectiveness 
technology assessments as a member of the West Midlands Health Technology Assessment Collaboration 
and the Aggressive Research Intelligence Facility based at the University of Birmingham. She is currently 
undertaking a systematic review on PET and PET/CT in breast cancer recurrence (HTA no 08/34) concerned 
with the incremental diagnostic accuracy of PET and PET/CT compared to existing diagnostic strategies 
in recurrent breast cancer. PG is a consultant radiologist with expertise in PET CT in patients with 
gynaecological cancers. RM is the chair of Jo’s Trust Fighting Cervical Cancer, the only UK dedicated to 
women, their families and friends affected by pre-cancer and cancer of the cervix.
The applicants will be supported in an advisory capacity by Dr Chris Hyde, Dr Jon J Deeks and Dr Chris 
Williams. JJD is an expert in test evaluation leading the NIHR funded Diagnostic evaluation and review 
support unit, and will provide input into the study design and in its output as a Cochrane review. CW 
is a Medical Oncologist (specialising in gynaecological cancer), with a particular interest in clinical trials 
methodology and systematic reviews.He is the Co-ordinating Editor of the Cochrane Gynaecological 
Cancer Review Group and a past Chair of the Cancer Therapy Committee and the Gynaecological Cancer 
Working party of the Medical Research Council. CH has been involved in projects like CASP (Critical 
Appraisal Skills for Purchasers) and the Cochrane Group on Effective Practice and Organisation of Care 
(EPOC). Through ARIF, his aim is to facilitate the use of research information, particularly systematic reviews 
of effectiveness in population level health care decision making within the West Midlands.
7. Contribution to Collective Research Effort:
This systematic review on the added value of PET-CT and cost effectiveness analysis of PET-CT imaging in 
comparison with current imaging fits comfortably with previously published HTA evaluations of PET-CT in 
other cancers. This research application complements existing NCRN (National cancer research network) 
portfolio research in gynaecological cancer. Members of the research team (PM, SS, KK, TR, AT, PG) are 
co-applicants in an NCRN endorsed primary investigation of PET-CT in endometrial cancer.
Due to the multiple methods employed by the proposed evidence synthesis the project team expect that 
the outputs of the work would be of interest to a broad research and clinical community including experts 
in the areas of evidence synthesis and in particular synthesis of test accuracy, gynaecological cancer, and 
decision making. Outputs would be submitted for presentation at national and international conferences 
such as Health Technology Assessment international, Medical Decision Making, European Society of 
Gynaecological Oncology (EGSO) and Society of Gynaecological Oncology (SGO). Similarly the outputs of 
this work would be of interest to a variety of peer reviewed journals and the project team would aim for 
a minimum of 3 peer reviewed publications in addition to publication as an HTA monograph. One of the 
outputs of this project would be a Cochrane review to be added to the Cochrane database of systematic 
reviews of test accuracy.
The project team have involved members of Jo’s trust, a reputed national charity in cervical cancer and 
user representatives of the Pan Birmingham cancer research network (PBCRN) and the Lancashire cancer 
networks. Users will be represented in study conduct and planning of dissemination strategies. Experience 
from previous research conducted by the team (HTA no 01/64/04: Methods of prediction and prevention 
of pre-eclampsia: Systematic review of accuracy and effectiveness literature with economic modelling in 
preterm labour) has already indicated that publication and dissemination needs careful consideration from 
the outset. Publication strategy will also need to anticipate early the need for versions of the report, which 
can be, used by women themselves. For this we will seek input from relevant consumers.

8. Please provide details about any related (planned or active) 
grants held by any member of your research team in this or 
similar research areas.
KSK has been awarded MRC studentship fellowship to undertake systematic reviews of accuracy of 
tests and treatment in gynaecologic cancer including cervical cancer. The information from the review 
on accuracy of PET CT over CT or MRI in diagnosing primary cervical cancer will be integrated in the 
modelling. We have also undertaking modelling and decision analytic economic evaluation for tests in 
vulval cancer and the experience will be utilised in modelling for this project. PM has been successfully 
awarded a NHS Cochrane grant application as a joint editor of the Cochrane Gynaecological Review Group 
for £380K to support the generation of updated evidence based gynaecological oncology guidelines 
March 20007. He has also developed a joint project with the departments of epidemiology and psychology 
at UCLAN investigating the impact of cancer symptoms and being referred to secondary care. SS has 1 
PhD student funded by the department of Health investigating the epigenetic changes induced by HPV 
in cervical cancer. The ongoing work by SS and PM in gynaecologic oncology will be of use in providing 
subjective probabilistic estimates for test accuracy and effectiveness. AF (information specialist) is currently 
working on an HTA assessing the value of PET-CT for recurrent breast cancer and her expertise in devising 
the search strategy and database management will be of benefit to this proposal.
9. Summary for the non expert
Every year in the UK, over 2,800 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 1,000 women will die 
from the disease. After breast cancer, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women aged 
35 and under. Early stage cervical cancer is treated with either surgery or chemo radiotherapy with a cure 
rate of 80%. Advanced stage cervical cancer is usually treated with chemo radiotherapy or chemotherapy 
alone and 30–50% of patients will have persistent or recurrent disease after treatment. The prognosis for 
recurrent cervical cancer is generally poor. The reported 5 year survival rates in recurrent cervical cancer are 
between 3.2% and 13% and the time to recurrence is short with 75% occurring before 3 years.
An accurate restaging of the extent of recurrent cancer (confined to the pelvis, spread to the lymph nodes 
or spread to distant organs) helps to plan subsequent treatment. Accurate identification of incurable 
spread of cancer avoids unnecessary treatment which itself is unpleasant and carries considerable risk, 
while more accurate delineation of tumour extent (restaging) increases the probability of receiving 
treatments appropriate to the extent of spread which may lead to improvements in survival and quality 
of life.
In current clinical practice, patients are monitored at regular intervals after primary treatment to detect 
persistent or recurrent disease. Present techniques of clinical examination and CT or MRI scans can be 
unreliable in detecting persistent or recurrent disease in the pelvis after radiotherapy as radiotherapy 
induced scarring can potentially conceal recurrent disease. Similarly, CT and MRI may not identify disease 
spread to lymph nodes and other organs. PET CT (Positron Emission Tomography with anatomical CT 
images) is an imaging method using radio labelled molecules to detect metabolically active tumours in 
the management of cancer patients. PET CT has been shown to improve the detection of cancer and its 
spread from 8% to 43% over conventional testing in patients with lung, colorectal cancer, lymphoma, 
melanoma, breast cancer, and thyroid cancer and it may have similar benefits for patients with recurrent 
cervical cancer.
For the proposed project our objectives are as follows:
In women who had undergone treatment for cervical cancer, under routine surveillance or with suspicion 
of recurrence

NIHR Journals Library
Appendix 1
160
z To assess if the addition of PET-CT to existing scans (CT or MRI) improves the detection of recurrent 
cervical cancer
z To evaluate if the use of PET-CT results in change in (re)staging i.e. extent of recurrence compared to 
CT or MRI
z To assess the impact of performing PET-CT on the planned treatment after diagnosis of recurrence and 
during subsequent monitoring
z To summarise the effectiveness of available treatments in women with recurrent cervical cancer
z To estimate the impact of PET CT findings patient outcomes and the costs associated with its routine 
use in this patient group.
We plan to fulfil the above objectives by systematically identifying the available evidence on the diagnostic 
accuracy of PET CT in recurrent cervical cancer compared to the diagnostic accuracy of exiting diagnostic 
tests used in this patients group and the effectiveness of treatments for recurrent cervical cancer. The 
evidence found will be used in an economic evaluation comparing existing testing and treatment strategies 
with PET CT guided treatment strategies. This evaluation will inform current treatment policy in this clinical 
area and highlight future research need.

Appendix 2 Scoping search strategies and results
T
he objective was a scoping search to identify published systematic reviews (for diagnostic accuracy, 
yield and effectiveness). Searches were undertaken between May 2010 and August 2010. The following 
databases would be searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, The Cochrane Library (all 
databases), UK Clinical Research Network Study Portfolio and ClinicalTrials.gov.
The search terms used are shown below.
In total, 468 citations for published studies and 12 citations for ongoing research were found. Of these, 
50 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility and one systematic review was found.59 This was assessed 
using the form below.

THE USE OF PETCT IN THE INVESTIGATION OF RECURRENT CERVICAL CANCER
Currently in the United Kingdom, patients with suspected cervical cancer recurrence will undergo
• clinical examination (rectovaginal and speculum examination, assessment of inguinal/ 
supraclavicular lymph nodes)
• cross sectional imaging by MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) or CT (Computed 
Tomography) of chest, abdomen and pelvis
• examination under anaesthesia, histological confirmation of any vaginal vault mass by 
biopsies.
The HTA project is evaluating the added value of PET/CT to current imaging practice for restaging 
women with recurrent cervical cancer. Information from the elicitation exercise will be used to 
complement the findings of a systematic review in order to achieve objective 1 in figure 1 below:
Fig 1: Imaging modalities and treatment strategies in women with recurrent cervical cancer
The accuracy of PETCT in addition to CT/MRI will be examined for women with initial stage I-IV 
disease presenting with symptoms and for surveillance of asymptomatic women with initial stage 1B2-
IV.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
The following information is to assist with interpretation of the information we are about to elicit. For 
example, your estimates of accuracy may vary according to your speciality or to your experience of 
using PETCT.
1) Speciality
2) Years working in your current speciality
3) In any one single follow up consultation for patients under surveillance following an initial diagnosis 
of cervical cancer, in what % of patients do you estimate using MRI alone; CT alone; a combination of 
CT and MRI?
Indicate the % of patients who you estimate receive (CT); (MRI );(CT and MRI)ensuring the total % of 
patients sums to 100%
Imaging % of patients receiving tests in any one follow up consultation
CT alone
MRI alone
CT + MRI
TOTAL 100%
4) Do you currently use PETCT as part of the investigation of recurrent cervical cancer? 
Yes / No
4 a) If you answered ‘Yes’ to Q.4, please state how long you have been using PETCT as part of the 
investigation of recurrent cervical cancer
4 b) If you answered ‘Yes’ to Q.4, please briefly describe in which patients or circumstances you use 
PETCT

WHAT IS THE PREVALENCE OF RECURRENT DISEASE?
The first piece of information we would like to elicit from you is your estimate of the prevalence of 
recurrent cancer in symptomatic and asymptomatic women 3 months post completion of primary 
treatment. 
4) Of women with a mix of initial stage I-IV cervical cancer presenting with symptoms suspicious for 
recurrence a minimum of 3 months post completion of treatment, what % would you estimate to have 
recurrent disease?
Indicate the likelihood of each option by allocating a total of 100 points across the 5 options.

-All patients are assumed to be a minimum of 3 months post completion of initial treatment (surgery+/-
chemotherapy or chemotherapy only). 
-All patients are assumed to be symptomatic and have had a clinical examination which may be under 
anaesthesia (histological confirmation of any vaginal vault mass by biopsies) or not under general 
anaesthesia (rectovaginal and speculum examination, assessment of inguinal/ supraclavicular lymph 
nodes). 
-Patients subsequently receive either:
-CT and/or MRI at the discretion of their physician and irrespective of the results of clinical 
examination. In other words clinical examination is not used to triage patients for further imaging with 
CT and/or MRI; CT and/or MRI are used as an add on to clinical examination.

Appendix 9 Economic evaluation systematic 
review search strategies and study categories
T
he search strategy in this appendix was used to identify economic evaluation studies from the EMBASE 
database on the use of PET-CT to detect recurrent cervical cancer. Similar search strategies were used 
for MEDLINE and the ISI Web of Knowledge. NHS EED, DARE and HTA were searched within The Cochrane 
Library using the ‘cervical cancer’ search term.

Study categories
Stage I: selection of the papers.
(a) The study reports an economic evaluation based on primary (i.e. original data collected specifically for 
the study) or secondary (i.e. unoriginal data collected from already published articles or other sources) 
research on the costs and use of care and includes formal economic evaluation.
(b) The study discusses the economic aspects of recurrent cervical cancer and contains useful primary or 
secondary cost or use data but is not an economic evaluation.
(c) The study discusses economic aspects of policies for care but is neither A nor B.
(d) The study has no relevance to recurrent cervical cancer.
Stage II: further categorisation of the relevant studies
Studies that were considered relevant to the systematic review (A, B and C) were read in full and further 
classified according to the study type as outlined below:
1. economic evaluation studies that reported their results in terms of cost per QALY
2. other economic evaluation studies that did not report their results in terms of cost per QALY (e.g. 
recurrence detected)
3. studies not categorised as 1 or 2.
All studies categorised as A(1) and A(2) were included in the quality assessment stage. Papers retrieved 
that were not classified as above were rejected at this stage.

28 days instead of the usual 21-day schedule, the 
cisplatin dose was adjusted to 70mg/m2 instead of 
the standard 50mg/m2 to maintain equivalent dose 
intensity of the drug (ITP arm)
Treatment duration:
Target of six cycles. Treatment discontinued in case 
of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity 
(achieved in 54% and 63% of patients who received 
the IP and the ITP regimens respectively)
Response rate: WHO 
criteria for response 
were used
Survival was estimated 
from the initiation of 
treatment to the date of 
last follow-up or until 
the patient’s death
Progression-free survival 
was calculated from the 
initiation of treatment 
to the first documented 
progression of disease
Toxicity (WHO criteria)
Assessment of treatment 
outcome was blinded to the 
treatment group assignment

Progression-free survival
Survival
Patients were prospectively 
stratified according to 
whether they had received 
previous radiation-sensitiser 
treatment (hydroxyurea, 
cisplatin or fluorouracil) 
and by performance status 
and were then centrally 
randomised
ITT analysis was 
implemented. A total of 10 
patients did not receive the 
randomised study treatment. 
They were classified as non￾responders and grouped 
by randomised treatment 
in a ITT analysis. They are 
also included in the analysis 
of overall survival and 
progression-free survival

Appendix 17 Systematic review of single cisplatin 
treatment in cervical cancer
Methods
Searches were conducted in MEDLINE (Ovid) and the Cochrane database (CENTRAL; from inception to 
January 2012) for any studies evaluating cisplatin in cervical cancer. The search terms used were ‘cisplatin’ 
and ‘cervical cancer’. Both MeSH terms and text words were used and a therapy clinical query maximising 
sensitivity was used in MEDLINE. Reference lists from relevant systematic reviews and guidelines were also 
searched. Included were any fully published RCTs in women with diagnosed cervical cancer (any stage, 
recurrent or primary) investigating cisplatin (including synonyms such as cis-platinum, cis-DDP) compared 
with no treatment and presenting any clinical outcomes but specifically interested in overall survival curves. 
The best-quality evidence for input into the economic model was sought. Preliminary and final inclusion 
decisions were made by one researcher (CM). Data extraction and quality assessment for the chosen 
RCT were performed by two researchers (CM, PA). If more than one large recent good-quality study was 
available meta-analysis would have been performed but this proved not to be necessary.
Results
Database searches yielded 1524 citations. Two published papers that nearly met the inclusion criteria were 
excluded: the study by Bonomi et al.64 is a RCT that evaluates three different doses of cisplatin but has no 
control arm, and the study by Thigpen et al.149 is a case series of cisplatin in recurrent cervical cancer and 
has no control arm without cisplatin. Three abstracts66,150,151 were also excluded. One paper152 was not 
available but as this did not give a sample size (as reported in Tzorias et al.146) it would be unlikely that 
this would be the best paper available. Four full papers127,153–155 were evaluated and all compared cisplatin 
plus radiotherapy with radiotherapy only. Pearcey et al.127 was chosen as the best paper for several reasons: 
participants were enrolled between 1991 and 1996 (i.e. after 1990), it had the largest sample size (259 
patients), patients had a variety of FIGO stages including IVA and a survival curve for both arms was 
presented for up to 10 years.

Description of the pathways for the model structure
Asymptomatic without cancer
At cycle 2 and onwards, that is, at 6 months’ follow-up and onwards, these women, in accordance with 
the schedule, will receive standard practice together with PET-CT. Women with an abnormal examination 
will receive a biopsy. Women who survived 3 months following the biopsy can either become recurrent 
or remain without recurrence. For those women who become recurrent, the disease can be either 
asymptomatic or symptomatic. Those women who remain without recurrence can remain asymptomatic 
without cancer or symptomatic without cancer. Women who survived after normal examination or no 
examination can become recurrent or remain free of recurrent cervical cancer. Again, women in this group 
can also remain free of recurrence or remain asymptomatic without cancer or symptomatic without cancer. 
In the model structures below (specifically Figures 39 and 40) the term ‘No examination’ relates to cycles in 
the process in which the frequency of examination has dropped from every 3 months to every 6 months so 
at that point in the cycle there is no examination conducted.
Symptomatic without cancer
Women with symptoms that they suspect are related to recurrent cervical cancer will receive standard 
practice and PET-CT. Women who received an abnormal result will receive a biopsy. In this group the 
biopsy will confirm no recurrent cervical cancer and women will not receive any treatment. Women who 
survive at 3 months following biopsy can either become recurrent or remain without recurrence. For 
those women who are recurrent, the disease can be either asymptomatic or symptomatic. Those women 
who remained free of recurrence can remain asymptomatic without cancer or symptomatic without 
cancer. Women who survive after normal examination can become recurrent or remain free of recurrent 
cervical cancer.
Asymptomatic cancer at 3 months
At 3 months following treatment for initial cervical cancer, these women, in accordance with the schedule, 
will receive standard practice and PET-CT. Women with an abnormal examination will receive a biopsy. On 
confirmatory biopsy, women will receive treatment for persistent cancer. Women who survive 3 months 
following treatment will remain in the post-treatment asymptomatic with cancer state. Women with

no examination or a normal examination who survive 3 months will become either asymptomatic or 
symptomatic recurrent in the next cycle of the model.
Asymptomatic recurrence
Women who have asymptomatic recurrence will receive standard practice and PET-CT. Women with an 
abnormal examination will receive a biopsy. On confirmatory biopsy, women will receive treatment for 
asymptomatic recurrent cancer. Women who survive for 3 months following treatment will remain in the 
post-treatment asymptomatic with cancer state. Women with no examination or a normal examination 
who survive 3 months will become either asymptomatic or symptomatic recurrent in the next model cycle.
Symptomatic recurrence
Women who have symptomatic recurrence will receive standard practice and PET-CT. Women with an 
abnormal examination will receive a biopsy. On confirmatory biopsy, women will receive treatment for 
symptomatic recurrent cancer. Women who survive 3 months following treatment will remain in the post￾treatment symptomatic recurrence state. Women with a normal examination who survive 3 months will 
remain symptomatic in the next model cycle.
Symptomatic cancer at 3 months
Women who have symptomatic recurrence will receive standard practice and PET-CT. Women with an 
abnormal examination will receive a biopsy. On confirmatory biopsy, women will receive treatment for 
symptomatic persistent cancer. Women who survive 3 months following treatment will remain in the 
post-treatment symptomatic persistent state. Women with a normal examination who survive 3 months 
will remain symptomatic in the next model cycle and would be considered as recurrent once detected.
Post-treatment asymptomatic cancer at 3 months
Women will remain in this state until death.
Post-treatment symptomatic cancer at 3 months
Women will remain in this state until death.
Post-treatment asymptomatic recurrence
Women will remain in this state until death.
Post-treatment symptomatic recurrence
Women will remain in this state until death.
