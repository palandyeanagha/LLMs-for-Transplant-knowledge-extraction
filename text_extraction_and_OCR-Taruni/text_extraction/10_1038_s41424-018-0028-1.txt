Abstract
Background: Few studies with diverging results and a small sample size have compared autoimmune hepatitis (AIH)
in the elderly to younger patients.
Aim: To unbiasedly investigate the role of age in behaviour and treatment outcome of AIH.
Methods: All patients with probable or definite AIH type 1 in four tertiary academic centres were included in this
retrospective—and since 2006 prospective—cohort study. Influence of age on presentation, remission and outcome
of AIH were investigated.
Results: 359 patients were included. Presence of cirrhosis at AIH diagnosis around 30% was independent of age. ALAT
was higher at age 30–60 years on AIH diagnosis, and above age 60 there were less acute onset, less jaundice and
more concurrent autoimmune disease. Remission was reached in 80.2%, incomplete remission in 18.7%, only 1.1%
(all aged 50–65) was treatment-refractory. Age was not an independent predictor of remission, while cirrhosis was.
Above age 45 there was more diabetes, above age 60 more loss of remission. Rate of progression to cirrhosis was 10%
in the 10 years after diagnosis and unrelated to age at AIH diagnosis. With onset below age 30, there was more
development of decompensated cirrhosis over time. With higher age at AIH diagnosis there was a lower survival free
of liver-related death or liver transplantation.
Conclusions: AIH presents at all ages. Age influences features at diagnosis, but not response to treatment, while
survival without liver-related death or liver transplantation decreases with higher age at diagnosis.
Introduction
Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic progressive
inflammatory liver disease responsive to immunosup￾pression1,2
. Originally AIH was believed to be a disease of
young women3,4
. Currently it is known that AIH can
present at all ages. Several studies indicate an incidence
pattern with two age peaks, one in the second decade and
one between the fourth and sixth decade5–9
. Others show
a single peak between the fourth and seventh decade10–12.
Ten studies with relatively small sample size have
specifically addressed AIH in elderly patients with an
arbitrary age cut-off at 60 or 65 years and have
yielded diverging results5,6,8–15. These data were
recently included in a meta-analysis, which concluded

20%–25% of patients are above the age of 60 at diagnosis,
that patients above 60 years of age were more likely to
be cirrhotic and asymptomatic at diagnosis, had the
same response to treatment as compared to younger
patients, but were less likely to relapse after withdrawal
of treatment16. The aim of this multicentre, retrospective,
observational study was to unbiasedly investigate the
role of age at diagnosis regarding presentation, response
to therapy and outcome in a large group of patients
with AIH type 1.
Patients and methods
All patients diagnosed with probable of definite AIH
according to the International AIH group (IAIHG)
criteria from four academic centres were included1
. Since
August 2006 all previously known and new patients
are prospectively included in a national database. All
patients with anti-LKM antibodies—which were only
present in the younger group, presumably with AIH
type 2, which has a different clinical course—and
patients with overlap syndromes, as defined by the
Paris criteria for PBC and by cholangiography criteria
for PSC, were excluded2,17,18.
Informed consent was obtained from each patient
included in the study and the study protocol conforms
to the ethical guidelines of latest revision of the 1975
Declaration of Helsinki as reflected in a priori approval
by the institution’s human research committee.
Data concerning mode of presentation, baseline clinical,
laboratory and liver histological characteristics, con￾comitant autoimmune disease, results and adverse effects
of immunosuppressive treatment and long-term prog￾nosis, were retrospectively retrieved by chart review.
The mode of onset could be acute (symptom onset to
diagnosis less than six months), insidious (symptom onset
to diagnosis more than six months), or asymptomatic
(no symptoms, AIH accidentally discovered). Response
to treatment was defined according to the criteria in
the AASLD guideline19. Treatment failure was defined
as: worsening of clinical, laboratory and—if available—
histological features of interface hepatitis despite com￾pliance with therapy. Incomplete response was defined
as some improvement in clinical laboratory without nor￾malisation of serum aminotransferases and—if available—
histological presence of interface hepatitis despite
compliance with therapy. Remission was defined as
disappearance of symptoms, normal serum amino￾transferases, bilirubin and IgG—and if histology was
available—no interface hepatitis or normal hepatic tissue
or inactive cirrhosis; Loss of remission was defined as an
increase in serum aminotransferase levels above the upper
limit of normal on at least two occasions after having been
in remission with or without clinical symptoms and the
need to adjust or reinstitute drug therapy20. Relapse
was defined as serum aminotransferase levels of more
than threefold the upper limit of normal after having
been in remission. Decompensated cirrhosis was defined
as presence of ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, or oeso￾phageal varices. Duration of follow up was defined as the
time between diagnosis and the date of last outpatient
appointment, liver transplantation or death.
Primary endpoints were presentation, remission and
the combined endpoint of liver-related death or liver
transplantation. Secondary endpoints were differences
in biochemistry and serology, symptoms, mode of pre￾sentation, concurrent autoimmune diseases, initial and
maintenance treatment regimens, number of switches
of therapy, adverse effects of treatment, episodes of
loss of remission, number of relapses and cirrhosis
at presentation and disease progression (to cirrhosis,
decompensated cirrhosisliver transplantation or death).
Results were reported across all ages and with a 60-
and 65-year-cut-off.
For statistical analysis ANOVA, Fisher’s exact test,
Chi square test, Mann–Whitney U test and independent
samples T test were used where appropriate. Kaplan–
Meier (KM) survival analysis, Cox regression analysis,
Poisson distribution and log-rank test were used to
correct for the statistically significant differences in follow
up. p < 0.05 was considered the level of significance.
Results
Presentation
A total of 359 patients with probable and definite
AIH were identified from four academic centres. The
distribution of the age at diagnosis showed a bimodal
pattern (Fig. 1).

Symptoms and laboratory values per age category are
shown in Table 1. There was a similar percentage of cir￾rhosis (mean 29.7%) at diagnosis of AIH across ages.
There were no significant differences across age categories
in mode of presentation; nevertheless there was a trend
towards less acute presentation with AIH onset above the
age of >60 years, more asymptomatic presentation with
onset between 40 and 70 years, more insidious presenta￾tion between 70 and 79 years and less insidious pre￾sentation with onset at 40–49 years. The incidence of
HLA-DR4 with onset at or above 40 years vs below
40 years was 35% vs 12.5% (p = 0.001). Alanine amino￾transferase (ALAT) levels were higher in patients with
ages 30–60 years at onset (p < 0.001), while alkaline
phosphatase (ALP), ALP/ALAT ratio and albumin serum
levels were similar across ages categories. International
normalised rartio op prothrombin time (INR) was higher
with onset below 20 years (p < 0.05) and between 40–49
years (p < 0.05) of age at onset. There was more jaundice
with diagnosis of AIH below 60 vs at/above 60 years
(47.7% vs 26.1%, p = 0.001). Incidence of fatigue was
not different across ages. Frequencies of other symptoms
were too low to reliably asses differences across age
categories. Histological parameters were not different
across age categories (not shown).
Seventy-three patients (20%) were 60 years of age or
older (≥60 group or elderly group) and 286 patients
(80%) were younger than 60 years of age (<60 group or
younger group).
Baseline clinical, laboratory and histological character￾istics for these age categories are shown in Table 2 and
symptoms at presentation in Fig. 2 (and with 65 years as
cut-off in Supplementary Figure 1). Patients with onset
at 60 years or later presented with significantly lower
serum ALAT levels (430 vs 670 IU/l, p < 0.001) and more
concurrent autoimmune disease (33% vs 20%, p < 0.05).
In the group with onset above 60 years of age 24
patients (33%) had a concurrent autoimmune disorder
including thyroid disease (n = 12), coeliac disease (n = 2),
ulcerative colitis (n = 2), arthritis (n = 2), Sjögren’s syn￾drome (n = 2), scleroderma (n = 2), systemic lupus ery￾thematosus (n = 1), type one diabetes (n = 1), Guillain

Barré syndrome (n = 1) and Crohn’s disease (n = 1). Two
patients with onset above 60 were diagnosed with two
concurrent autoimmune diseases. Below 60 years of age
57 patients (20%) had a concurrent autoimmune disorder
including thyroid disease (n = 27), ulcerative colitis
(n = 8), systemic lupus erythematosus (n = 6), type one
diabetes (n = 4), coeliac disease (n = 2), Crohn’s disease
(n = 2), sarcoidosis (n = 2), unclassified connective tissue
disease (n = 2), arthritis (n = 1), haemolysis (n = 1),
Sjögren’s syndrome (n = 1), Henoch Schönlein purpura
(n = 1), idiopathic thrombocytopenia (n = 1), multiple
sclerosis (n = 1) and myasthenia gravis (n = 1). Three
patients with onset before age 60 were diagnosed with two
concurrent autoimmune diseases. The patients above
60 significantly less often had an acute mode of pre￾sentation (10.0% vs 23.2%, p = 0.016) (Table 2). There
were similar rates of insidious (70.0% vs 61.4%, p = 0.187)
and asymptomatic presentation (20.0% vs 15.4%, p =
0.365) above and below 60 years of age at onset.
There were no other significant baseline differences in
presentation of AIH related to age. There also was no
difference in percentage of patients with cirrhosis at
diagnosis of AIH across ages. There were no differences in
lead-time (time before referral while there was suspected
liver disease) (e.g. in patients with age of onset below and
above 60; p = 0.637).
Treatment, remission and side effects
Details on treatment effects are shown in Table 3. A
mean of 80.2% of patients reached remission and 18.7%
incomplete remission, with overall no differences between
categories of age at AIH presentation. There were only
four cases (1.1% of patients) of treatment failure, all with
age on presentation between 50 and 65 years of age. In
287 patients both response to therapy and time to
remission after diagnosis were known. With KM survival
analysis (censored for loss to follow up, death or liver
transplantation) there was less remission in patients with
AIH diagnosis before age 25 than at/after age 25 years
(p = 0.005) (Fig. 3a). There was a similar trend with age
cut-off at 30 years (p = 0.089) (Fig. 3b), while there was no
difference with age cut-off at 40 years (p = 0.619) (Fig. 3c),
at 50 years (p = 0.618) (Fig. 3d), at 60 years (p = 0.981)

(Supplementary Figure 2A) or 65 years (p = 0.842) (Sup￾plementary Figure 2B). With cirrhosis at AIH diagnosis
there was less remission than without cirrhosis
(p < 0.001). As a continuous variable age at diagnosis was
not a predictor of remission (p = 0.410). While age at AIH
diagnosis below 25 years was a predictor of less remission
in univariate analysis (exp(B) = 0.706, 95%CI 0.519–0.961,
p = 0.027), in multivariate analysis it was not a
predictor that was independent (exp(B) = 0.743, 95% CI
0.546–1.011, p = 0.059) from absence of cirrhosis at
diagnosis which was a significant predictor of remission
(exp(B) = 1.807, 95%CI 1.350–2.419, p < 0.001).
Loss of remission occurred in mean 60.4% (range
50–100%) of patients and was independent from age at
AIH onset. Relapse occurred in mean 42.5% (range
33.3–55.8%) of patients and was also independent from
age at AIH onset.
Treatment details in patients with onset above and
below 60 years of age are shown in Table 4. There were no
significant differences in initial therapy, immunomodu￾lator changes (Poisson distribution, relative risk 0.96 (95%
CI 0.65–1.43)) and maintenance therapy. One hundred
and forty-six patients (41%) experienced one or multiple
side effects of either the prednisone, the immunomodu￾lator or both. Ninety-six of the 359 patients (27%)
developed side effects as a result of corticosteroid therapy.
Diabetes was more frequent with age at AIH onset at or
above 45 years vs below 45 years (10.6% vs 4.5%,
p = 0.028). Twenty-five of the 359 patients (7%) developed
side effects of the immunomodulator, mostly azathiopr￾ine, while there was no significant difference across ages.
In the group with onset at/above vs below 60 years there
were no differences in rates of remission, incomplete
response and treatment failure (Table 5). Despite the
absence of differences in loss of remission across age
categories, corrected for follow-up time the patients with
onset below 60 experienced significantly less loss of
remission than those with onset above 60 years of age
(Poisson distribution, relative risk 1.38 (95% CI 1.05–1.82,
p = 0.022)). There was no significant difference in relapse
rate after remission in patients with onset below or above
60 years of age (Poisson distribution, relative risk 1.2 (95%
CI 0.78–1.86)).
Progression of disease
Details on progression of disease across ages at onset
are shown in Table 6: progression to cirrhosis seemed to
occur more frequently with AIH onset before age 30 than
at or above 30 years of age (13.3 vs 6.6%. p = 0.036).
However, correcting for differences in follow-up time with

Kaplan–Meier survival analysis there was no such differ￾ence: patients before age 30 vs those at or after age 30 at
AIH diagnosis remained free of cirrhosis in 86.6% vs
85.8% of cases in 160 months from diagnosis (p = 0.533).
With other cut-offs for age at AIH diagnosis with KM
analysis there also was no significant difference in rate
of developing cirrhosis (with age 40 p = 0.983; with age 50
p = 0.963; with age 60 p = 0.607; with age 65 p = 0.104).
The percentage of patients without cirrhosis at AIH
diagnosis remaining free of cirrhosis at 1/2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10,
and 20 years during follow up after AIH diagnosis was
99.7% (SE 0.3%), 99.1% (SE 0.5%), 98.2% (0.7%), 97.9%
(SE 0.8%), 97.2% (0.9%), 96.5% (1.1%), 90.7% (2.0%), and
85.1% (2.9%), respectively (Fig. 4).
Progression to decompensated cirrhosis was more fre￾quent with age at onset of AIH below vs at/above 30 years
(p = 0.02), while there was no difference with AIH onset
below vs at/above ages 40 (p = 0.09), 50 (p = 0.32), or
60 years (p = 0.61) (Fig. 5a–d).
Survival free of progression to all (combined liver￾related or unrelated) death or liver transplantation was
not different in KM survival analysis with AIH onset
before or at/after 30 (87.5 vs 90.0% at 384 months,
p = 0.413), 40 (86.3 vs 90.8% at 152 months, p = 0.994), 50
(91.9% vs 89.2% at 144 months, p = 0.853), or 60 years
of age (90.0 vs 85.8% at 144 months, p = 0.809).
Based on Table 6 there appears to be more liver-related
death with AIH onset at or above 45 years vs below
45 years of age (5.6% vs 2.2%, p = 0.004), while liver
transplantation was more frequent with AIH onset below
45 years of age vs with onset at or above 45 years of age
(6.7% vs 2.2%, p = 0.042). Correcting for follow-up time
with KM survival analysis survival free of liver-related
death or liver transplantation was higher for patients
with AIH diagnosis before than at/after 30 years of age:
(p = 0.019) (Fig. 6a) or 40 years of age (p = 0.026)
(Fig. 6b). Survival free of liver-related death or liver
transplantation was similar with age below 50 vs at/above
50 years at diagnosis (p = 0.447) (Fig. 6c), but higher with
age below 60 vs at/above 60 years at diagnosis (p = 0.012)
(Fig. 6d), or 65 years at diagnosis (p = 0.004) (Supple￾mentary Figure 3). So, except below and at/above

50 years, with higher age at AIH diagnosis there was
more liver-related death or liver transplantation.
As a continuous variable both age at diagnosis of AIH
(exp(B) = 1.026, 95%CI 1.008–1.045, p = 0.006) and cir￾rhosis at diagnosis (exp(B) = 3.266, 95%CI 1.677–6.362,
p = 0.001) were independent predictors of liver-related
death or liver transplantation.
Time to progression overall (to cirrhosis, to decom￾pensated cirrhosis, liver transplantation or liver-related
death) appears shorter with increasing age on diagnosis of
AIH across age categories (p < 0.001) (Table 6). However,
correcting for follow-up time with Cox regression analysis
age at AIH diagnosis was not related to time to disease
progression as defined overall and in subgroups (no cir￾rhosis at diagnosis: HR 0.99 (95% CI 0.97–1.01, p =
0.220), with cirrhosis at diagnosis: HR 1.01 (95% CI
0.99–1.03) and with decompensated cirrhosis at diagnosis:
HR 1.01 (95% CI 0.98–1.05)).
Outcome below vs at or above age 60 is shown in
Table 7: there were no significant differences between
these age groups, although there was only one (1.4%) liver
transplantation with onset of AIH above age 60 vs 15
(5.2%) with onset below 60 years (p = 0.162).
Nine patients never started medication, five patients at/
above 60 and four below age 60 years. Despite the lack of
treatment, four of them reached remission (among which
one elderly patient), the other five had an incomplete
response (among which four elderly patients). At the end
of follow up 11 patients above 60 years and 27 patients
below age 60 at diagnosis received no treatment (includ￾ing the nine previously mentioned patients). Outcome of
these patients is shown in Table 8. Reasons for stopping
treatment were unknown for all patients.
Analysis with 65 years as age cut-off yielded similar
results as with age 60, as shown in Supplementary Tables
1–4 and Supplementary Figures 1–3.
Discussion
Presentation of AIH
There were no significant differences across age cate￾gories in mode (acute, insidious or asymptomatic) of
presentation. ALAT was highest with AIH onset between
30 and 60 years of age. INR was higher with onset below
20 years and between 40 and 50 years. As in other studies
the incidence of HLA-DR4 was higher with age at diag￾nosis at or above 40 years, and there was a bimodal pat￾tern in age at diagnosis, with one peak in the second and
one in the fifth decade6,10,16,21. The patients included in

this study originated from four academic centres in con￾trast to some reports from non-academic centres, where
one age-peak between the fourth and seventh decade was
seen5,6,8–11. The finding that one in five patients were at or
above the age of 60 at diagnosis, confirms a recent meta￾analysis of smaller studies16. The finding that patients
above 60 present with lower serum alanine amino￾transaminase levels and with less jaundice than younger
patients is in concurrence with most previous studies,
although three studies found no difference in mode of
onset. There could be a referral bias, as the sickest
younger patients may more often than elderly patients
have been transferred to tertiary referral centres because
of their expertise and possibility of liver transplanta￾tion6,8,9,12,13. There were significantly more autoimmune
diseases with onset above 60 years as compared to
younger patients, with thyroid diseases by far being the
most frequent in both groups. Previous studies did not
find significant differences in concurrent autoimmune
diseases between younger and elderly patients, but the
studies by Granito et al. and Czaja et al. did show a trend
towards more autoimmune diseases in elderly. It is pos￾sible that in the previous studies significance was not
reached because of small sample sizes6,10,16. In a recently
performed meta-analysis it was concluded that patients
aged above 60 or 65 present more often with cirrhosis at
diagnosis16. Our data does not support these findings, as
the percentage of cirrhosis at diagnosis was around 30% at
all ages. Taking a detailed look at the meta-analysis, six
out of the nine studies found no difference in cirrhosis at
diagnosis between young and elderly patients. We studied
whether there was a difference between age groups in
time before referral while there already was suspected
liver disease, but there was no such lead-time bias5,6,8–14.
Treatment, remission
There were no differences in initial and maintenance
therapies between younger and elderly patients in the
current data. Treatment was equally tolerated in all age
groups. The 27% side effects as a result of corticosteroid
therapy in the current study was lower than in previous
reports that mention corticosteroid-related side effects in

as many as 80% of patients19. Most studies are retro￾spective studies, which can lead to over- or under￾reporting and different definition of side effects. Diabetes
was more frequent with age at AIH onset at or above 45
years, which indicates that elderly patients may benefit
more from corticosteroid-sparing maintenance options.
The 7% side effects from the immunomodulator, mostly
azathioprine, was comparable to previous reports, with no
significant difference between elderly and younger
patients19.
Of all patients 80% (71–90%) reached remission and
19% (10–29%) incomplete remission, with treatment
failure in only four (1%) patients aged 50–65 years at
onset. Age was not an independent predictor of
remission, while cirrhosis at diagnosis was. The overall
response to treatment was comparable to previous
reports8–11,22. In contrast to previous reports there were
overall no differences in rates of relapse or loss of
remission, except for patients with onset at or above age
60 who—when corrected for follow-up time—experienced
more loss of remission8,9,16. Fear of more side effects may
have led to suboptimal treatment and more rapid tapering
of medication in some patients with diagnosis over
age 608,10. Unfortunately, exact treatment and dosing
schedules were not available for all patients to evaluate
treatment schedules and alternative therapies in more
detail23.
Progression
Lower age at AIH diagnosis and cirrhosis were inde￾pendent predictors of survival without liver-related
death or liver transplantation. This was despite the
finding that development of decompensated cirrhosis
was more common with AIH onset below an age of 30
years. In patients without cirrhosis on diagnosis there
was a linear progression towards cirrhosis over time,
which was 10% in the first 10 years, and in KM analysis
age at diagnosis did not influence this rate. Despite the
fact that the majority of patients reaches remission, and
survival without liver-related death or liver transplan￾tation is quite good, disease progression despite treat￾ment occurs and is an important target for future
research. This may be due to continuing inflammation,
which can be present in liver biopsies despite

biochemical remission24. On the other hand the
advantage of complete over incomplete remission is
debatable, since in a previous study survival with
incomplete remission did not differ from patients with
complete biochemical remission25.
The age influence on presentation and on survival free of
liver-related death or liver transplantation and the absent
influence of age on remission are novel findings not men￾tioned in earlier reports25–27. Nevertheless, this study car￾ries the limitations of a—partially—retrospective study with
some missing values. Data beyond ten years after diagnosis
may be less accurate, since prospective inclusion of patients
in the current cohort started in 2006. Strengths are the large
cohort of patients with long-term follow up, the detailed
analysis of presenting signs and symptoms, and the first
unbiased analysis of the role of age in presentation, response
to therapy and disease progression.
These data support the idea that at all ages in patients
with liver disease AIH should be seriously considered, and
that treatment of AIH should be according to the current
guidelines at all ages, while recognising the observed
differences between elderly and younger patients during
maintenance therapy28.
Study Highlights
What is current knowledge?
● Autoimmune hepatitis is an important cause of
liver disease in elderly patients as 20%–25% of
patients are above the age of 60 at diagnosis.
● Ten studies with relatively small sample size have
specifically addressed AIH in elderly patients and
have yielded diverging results with respect to
baseline clinical, laboratory and liver histological
characteristics, mode of presentation, response to
treatment and long-term outcome.
● In a meta-analysis of these studies elderly patients
were more likely to be cirrhotic and asymptomatic

at diagnosis, had the same response to treatment
as compared to younger patients, but were less
likely to relapse after withdrawal of treatment
What is new here?
● The role of age was studied unbiasedly.
● The rate of cirrhosis around 30% at diagnosis of
AIH was similar at all ages.
● ALAT levels were higher in patients aged 30–60
years on AIH diagnosis.
● Patients with AIH diagnosis above age 60 less
frequently had an acute onset, had lower alanine
aminotransaminase levels, less jaundice and more
concurrent autoimmune disease, but a comparable
rate of cirrhosis as compared to younger patients.
● In contrast to cirrhosis, age at AIH diagnosis was
not an independent predictor of remission.
● Remission was reached in 80.2%, incomplete
remission in 18.7%, only 1.1% (all aged 50–65) was
treatment-refractory.
● Overall loss of remission and relapse were
independent from age at AIH diagnosis, but with
AIH onset above age 60 there was more loss of
remission
● Diabetes was more frequent in patients diagnosed
after age 45 years.
● Age was not related to the risk of progression to
cirrhosis, which is 10% in 10 years
● If AIH was diagnosed before age 30 more
decompensated cirrhosis developed
● Higher age at AIH diagnosis and cirrhosis were
independent predictors of lower survival free of
progression to liver-related death or liver
transplantation
