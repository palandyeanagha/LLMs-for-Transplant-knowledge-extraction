Acute portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is characterized as
recent (<30 days) formation of thrombus within the main
portal vein or its branches. Although acute PVT is an uncom￾mon diagnosis, it can lead to serious morbidity, including
bowel infarction, as well as mortality. The clinical presenta￾tion of acute PVT can range from asymptomatic in partial PVT
to sepsis and hypotension in the patients with acute com￾plete PVT. The most common symptom in patients with
acute PVT is nonspecific abdominal pain.1
Because of the nonspecific symptomatology, the diagnosisis
usually made by imaging, primarily contrast-enhanced com￾puted tomography (CT) or ultrasound during the work-up for
abdominal pain. If the diagnosis of acute PVT is made with
Doppler ultrasound, further evaluation with CT or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) (►Fig. 1) is warranted to evaluate
(►Fig. 2) the extent of the thrombosis, assess for etiology, and
provide information about associated complications, such as
bowel ischemia.
It is important to differentiate acute from chronic PVT as
both entities are managed differently. The presence of a
cavernoma, a network of prominent collateral vessels in
the porta hepatis, indicates chronic PVT. Diagnosis of malig￾nant PVT is important as therapeutic strategies differ, which
can include locoregional therapy or chemotherapy based on
tumor type.2 Imaging features that suggest malignant PVT

Abstract Acute portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a relatively rare diagnosis with a nonspecific
clinical presentation. Imaging plays an important role in establishing the diagnosis as
well as the etiology and complications of acute PVT. Prompt diagnosis is essential to
prevent catastrophic short-term complications including bowel infarction, sepsis, and
possible death; missed diagnosis can also result in the long-term sequelae of portal
hypertension. Differentiation of acute from chronic PVT is crucial as management
strategies differ. Currently, guidelines for treating acute PVT recommend immediate
initiation of systemic anticoagulation. Catheter-directed therapy may be used in
combination with systemic anticoagulation in the setting of bowel ischemia or as an
adjunct in patients with a contraindication to systemic anticoagulation. In this review
article, we discuss the diagnosis and clinical features of acute PVT, focusing on current
medical and endovascular management strategies including mechanical thrombect￾omy and fibrinolytic therapy.

include enhancing thrombus on contrast-enhanced CT or
MRI, the presence of flow on Doppler ultrasound, or invasion
of the wall of the portal vein.
There are several factors that increase risk for the devel￾opment of acute PVT. Local factors include cancer within any
abdominal organ, cirrhosis, extrinsic compression of the
portal vein and/or its branches, postoperative patients, and
patients with abdominal infections or inflammation such as
pancreatitis or inflammatory bowel disease. Local factors
play a role in acute PVT 21 to 30% of the time.3,4 Systemic
risk factors include prothrombotic disorders, and are present
in up to 70% of patients who present with acute PVT.5–8
Prothrombin gene mutation has a nearly 4.5-fold increased
risk of PVT, while factor V Leiden mutation has a nearly
twofold risk of acute PVT.8,9 Myeloproliferative disorders
such as Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) mutation are found in 21 to 37%
of patients with acute PVT.8,10–12 A prothrombotic state may
also result from recent contraceptive use as well as deficien￾cies of antithrombin, protein C, and protein S.6–8
Timely therapy for acute PVT is essential to prevent
propagation of thrombus and restore adequate venous out￾flow from the small bowel to prevent small bowel infarction
and sequelae of portal hypertension. If a patient is found to
have a local risk factor, work-up for prothrombotic disorders
must still be performed, as 35% of patients may have both
local and systemic risk factors for PVT. Approximately 25% of
patients who develop acute PVTwill have no identifiable risk
factor.8 In this article, the data and rationale for medical and
endovascular therapy will be reviewed, along with devices
frequently used in endovascular procedures.
Medical Therapy
Currently, the first-line treatment for management of acute
PVT is systemic anticoagulation. Prior studies have shown
that without systemic anticoagulation, spontaneous reca￾nalization occurs in only 16.7% of cases.13 Collective data
from retrospective studies have shown when anticoagula￾tion is initiated immediately and continued for 6 months,
50% of patients had complete recanalization, 40% had
partial recanalization, and 10% of patients had no recana￾lization.14,15 Major complications from anticoagulation
were relatively low, occurring in less than 5% of patients.
Prospective multicenter data have demonstrated a 1-year
recanalization rate of 38%, with no recanalization in any of
the patients beyond the sixth month after initiation of

anticoagulation treatment; factors that may predict failure
of recanalization included presence of ascites, JAK2 muta￾tion, and superior mesenteric venous thrombus. Further￾more, initiation of anticoagulation is essential; data have
shown that if there is a delay the likelihood of recanaliza￾tion is very low.8
Currently, the European Association for the Study of the
Liver (EASL) recommends anticoagulation for at least
6 months, whereas the American Association for the Study
of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommends anticoagulation for at
least 3 months in patients with acute PVT.16,17 If an under￾lying prothrombotic condition is identified, longer term
systemic anticoagulation therapy would be recommended.
Endovascular Therapy
Endovascular treatment of acute PVT may be used in conjunc￾tion with systemic anticoagulation in the setting of imminent
bowel infarction or as the sole therapy in patients with a
contraindication to systemic anticoagulation. Several endo￾vascular techniques have been described for treating acute PVT
via direct or indirect access into the portal system, including
catheter-delivered fibrinolytic therapy and mechanical/suc￾tion thrombectomy with or without fibrinolytic therapy.
Direct percutaneous access can be obtained through a
transhepatic approach, although there is a theoretical
increased risk of bleeding and it may require embolization
of the access tract. The portal system can also be directly
accessed through creation of a transjugular intrahepatic
portosystemic shunt (TIPS), trans-splenic access, and others.
Indirect routes include infusion of thrombolytics into the
superior mesenteric artery (SMA), exposing portal venous
thrombus to fibrinolytic via the small bowel capillaries.
Mechanical Thrombectomy
Mechanical thrombectomy involves restoring flow within
the main portal vein using balloon thrombectomy, rheolytic
thrombectomy, and suction thrombectomy. Successful use of
mechanical thrombectomy–assisted thrombolysis has been
previously described in the literature, although no

prospective data are available to compare different techni￾ques with outcomes.18
Balloon thrombectomy involves inflation of the balloon
past the clot (Fogarty, Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) and
retracting the inflated balloon over the guidewire to pull the
clot into a patent vein, which then washes it away. This is
usually followed by angioplasty to increase luminal gain and
macerate any residual thrombus.
Rheolytic therapy uses high-velocity saline jets for
maceration of clot, allowing for passive thrombus evacuation
through the Bernoulli principle. The rheolytic thrombectomy
(AngioJet device) has been used off label in the portal venous
system. In addition to mechanical thrombectomy, this device
also has a “power-pulse mode” to distribute thrombolytic
agents into the clot.
Suction thrombectomy has evolved from the most basic
setup of having a large-volume syringe on the end of a large￾bore catheter to the use of vacuum-operated thrombectomy
tools.
(►Fig. 3) The aspiration thrombectomy (Penumbra Indigo
system) is a continuous suction device, most commonly used
for neurovascular and peripheral interventions. Catheters
are available in numerous sizes; the accompanying CT 8,
flexible 8F aspiration catheter is the most likely size to be
used for PVT intervention. Unlike the rheolytic thrombec￾tomy (AngioJet device), the aspiration thrombectomy
(Penumbra Indigo system) does not return volume to the
patient and may lead to rapid volume loss if thrombus is not
directly engaged at the end of the catheter.
Thrombolytic Therapy
If there is no contraindication to anticoagulation, another
option is passive infusion of fibrinolytic medications (alte￾plase, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) directly into acute
thrombus. This is usually accomplished with a multiple side
hole infusion catheter (Cragg-McNamara, Medtronic, Minnea￾polis, MN; or UniFuse, Angiodynamics, Latham, NY). These
catheters are typically 4F to 5F and are available in a variety of
working/infusion lengths.
Data from a retrospective review examining recanalization
of acute noncirrhotic, nonmalignant PVT via transjugular
thrombolysis with and without TIPS stent placement (Viatorr,
Gore Medical, Flagstaff, AZ) in 17 patients demonstrated
complete recanalization in 52.9% (9/17) and partial recanali￾zation in 41.2% (7/17).19 Cumulative 24-month secondary
portal vein patency was 88.2%; only one patient developed
cavernous transformation of the portal vein.19 Clinical success
was demonstrated by prevention of bowel resection in 15/17
patients as well as no patient with portal hypertensive com￾plications during follow-up. These data showed presence of
the JAK2 mutation predicted necessity of TIPS implantation;
furthermore, the risk of PVTrecurrence or TIPS thrombosis was
significantly higher in these patients.19 However, TIPS implan￾tation in noncirrhotic patients remains a controversial issue as
prior authors have demonstrated slow flow in the portal vein
to be biggest predictor of PVT.20
In a small series of 20 patients investigating thrombolysis
via direct transhepatic access or indirectly through the SMA,
the majority of patient had partial recanalization 12/20
(60%).21 Only 3/20 patients (15%) had complete recanaliza￾tion and there was no recanalization in 5/20 (25%) patients.21
Conclusion
Diagnosis of acute PVT is challenging; the managing clinician
must have a high index of suspicion; prompt diagnosis is
critical in instituting early therapy, as this can improve both
short- and long-term outcomes. Although first-line therapy is
systemic anticoagulation, endovascular therapy is indicated in
patients with evidence of impending bowel ischemia or a
concurrent contraindication to anticoagulation. Several endo￾vascular techniques have now been described for treating
acute PVT via direct and indirect access into the portal system
and include mechanical techniques with or without thrombo￾lytic therapy, as well as conventional fibrinolytic infusion via
infusion catheters. Prospective data are needed to compare
management techniques and evaluate outcomes.
