Abstract
Hypovitaminosis D is highly prevalent in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Recently, vitamin D 
has sparked widespread interest because of its potential favorable benefits on cardiovascular 
disease (CVD). Evidence from clinical studies and animal models supports the existence of 
biphasic cardiovascular effects of vitamin D, in which lower doses suppress CVD and higher 
doses stimulate CVD. However, the mechanism for the different effects remains unclear. 
Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) is a recently identified member of the FGF family, and 
thought to be actively involved in renal phosphate and vitamin D homeostasis. More specif￾ically, Vitamin D stimulates FGF-23 secretion and is inhibited by increased FGF-23. Given this 
background, we hypothesize that FGF-23 may provide a unique tool to explain the biphasic 
cardiovascular effects of vitamin D in CKD. The data presented in this review support the 
hypothesis that FGF-23 may be linked with the high cardiovascular risk in CKD through ac￾celerating the onset of vascular calcification, secondary hyperparathyroidism, left ventricular 
hypertrophy and endothelial dysfunction. Therefore, modulation of FGF-23 may become a 
potential therapeutic target to lowing cardiovascular risk in CKD. Several clinical interven￾tions, including decreased phosphate intake, phosphate binders, cinacalcet plus concurrent 
low-dose vitamin D, C-terminal tail of FGF-23 and renal transplantation, have been employed 
to manipulate FGF-23.

Introduction
Vitamin D refers to a group of compounds that 
have antirachitic activity. During the period of its 
discovery, it was recognized that there were two an￾tirachitic factors with distinct structures, vitamin D3
and vitamin D2. Vitamin D3 can be produced in the 
vertebrate skin as 7-dehydrocholesterol on exposure 
to ultraviolet-B from the sun, whereas vitamin D2
comes from plants [1]. Both vitamin D3 and vitamin 
D2 can be further modified by corresponding enzymes 
to produce different vitamin D metabolites. After 
vitamin D enters the body, it circulates bound to 
vitamin D-binding protein and is rapidly converted 
into its major circulating form, 25-hydroxyvitamin D
[25-(OH)D], by the liver. 25-(OH)D is filtered at the 
glomerulus and actively reabsorbed into renal tubular 
cells via megalin and cubulin, where it is converted 
into the potent hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D
[1,25-(OH)2D] by the enzyme 1α-hydroxylase [2]. 
25-(OH)D is the nutritional form of vitamin D. Serum 
25-(OH)D is regarded as the best indicator of vitamin

D status, because it has a longer biological half-life 
than 1,25-(OH)2D, and circulates in much higher 
concentrations. In contrast, 1,25-(OH)2D is the active 
form of vitamin D. Circulating levels of 1,25-(OH)2D 
chiefly depend on the ability of renal 1α-hydroxylase 
to convert 25-(OH)D into 1,25-(OH)2D. This ability is
decreased by a reduction in the nephron mass.
Therefore, in this review, when vitamin D status was 
mentioned, the “vitamin D” referred to “25-(OH)D”; 
when vitamin D therapy was mentioned, the “vitamin 
D” referred to “1,25-(OH)2D”.
Circulating 1,25-(OH)2D enters the target cells, 
either in its free form or facilitated by megalin, and 
binds to the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in the cyto￾plasm, which then translocates into the nucleus and 
heterodimerizes with the retinoic X receptor (RXR). 
The 1,25-(OH)2D-VDR-RXR complex then binds to 
vitamin D response elements (VDRE) on DNA to in￾crease transcription of vitamin D-regulated genes [3]. 
The classical physiological function of vitamin D is to 
maintain the calcium and phosphate homeostasis, 
accomplished by close coordination with parathyroid 
hormone (PTH) [4, 5].
Vitamin D status in chronic kidney disease 
(CKD)
The Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative 
(K/DOQI) has recently raised concerns of a high 
prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in patients with 
CKD [6]. According to serum 25-(OH)D levels, 76% of 
CKD patients display either vitamin D deficiency 
[42%; 25-(OH)D≤15ng/ml] or insufficiency [34%;
15ng/ml<25-(OH)D≤30ng/ml] [7]. What's worse, se￾rum 25-(OH)D is below the recommended sufficiency 
values in >90% of patients if they progress to 
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [8]. CKD patients are 
at particular risk of 25-(OH)D deficiency, including 
reduced sun exposure, impaired production of the 
25-(OH)D precursor molecule and reduced dietary 
intake [9]. In contrast to 25-(OH)D, circulating levels 
of 1,25-(OH)2D chiefly depend on the ability of renal 
1α-hydroxylase to convert 25-(OH)D into 
1,25-(OH)2D. This ability is decreased because of a 
reduction in the nephron mass [10]. It is therefore 
necessary to modulate the vitamin D signaling using 
1,25-(OH)2D or its analogues to compensate for the 
compromised vitamin D status which occurs in all 
stages of CKD, so that the classical functions of 
1,25-(OH)2D may be addressed [11].
Biphasic cardiovascular effects of vitamin 
D in CKD
The increased risk of cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) in patients with CKD has been well docu￾mented [12, 13]. Although it is true that many tradi￾tional cardiovascular risk factors are corrected in 
CKD, the results of intervention may not be as effica￾cious as those obtained in the general population. 
Thus, there may also be a unique milieu established in 
CKD, which leads to excess CVD burden by mecha￾nisms that are as yet not fully understood [14, 15].
Recently, vitamin D has sparked widespread interest 
because of its potential beneficial effects on CVD [16, 
17]. A historical cohort study carried out by Teng et al. 
showed that incident chronic hemodialysis patients 
treated with activated injectable vitamin D had a sig￾nificant survival advantage over a comparable group 
of chronic hemodialysis patients who did not; cardi￾ovascular-related mortality rates were 7.6 per 100 
person-years in the injectable vitamin D group, com￾pared with 14.6 per 100 person-years in the 
non-vitamin D group [18]. In stratified analyses by 
vitamin D therapy, after adjustment for age, sex, PTH 
and albumin, the odds ratio (OR) of all-cause mortal￾ity was 2.2 for 25-(OH)D levels <10ng/ml compared 
with 25-(OH)D levels >30ng/ml; in a similar stratified 
model of 1,25-(OH)2D, the adjusted OR of all-cause 
mortality was 3.1 for 1,25-(OH)2D levels of 6-13pg/ml 
compared with 1,25-(OH)2D levels >13pg/ml [19]. A 
meta-analysis examined 9 randomized controlled tri￾als and also found an 8% reduction in cardiovascular 
mortality with supplementation of very modest 
amounts of vitamin D (~500IU) [20]. More specifically, 
two other studies compared mortality among hemo￾dialysis patients receiving different types of 
1,25-(OH)2D formulations, and found that mortality 
was lower among patients receiving doxercalciferol 
(15.4 per 100 person-years) and paricalcitol (15.3 per 
100 person-years) versus calcitriol (19.6 per 100 per￾son-years) [21, 22]. However, the study of Tentori et al. 
raised questions about the previously reported sur￾vival advantage associated with vitamin D therapy 
[23]. In addition, an earlier and smaller study from 
India also did not show any benefit from having op￾timal levels of 25-(OH)D in subjects with established 
CVD; in contrast, the authors reported that very high 
levels of 25-(OH)D (>89ng/ml) were associated with 
an increased risk of ischemic heart disease [24]. Inter￾estingly, consistent with these findings in humans, an 
animal model of CKD showed that the administration 
of clinically relevant doses of vitamin D reduced arte￾rial calcification [25]; while in another study, rats fed 
on a diet rich in cholesterol and extremely high in 
vitamin D (1.8 million units/kg) developed greater 
arterial calcification [26]. Thus, evidence from clinical 
studies and animal models supports the existence of 
biphasic cardiovascular effects of vitamin D, in which

lower doses suppress CVD and higher doses stimu￾late CVD [27]. However, the mechanism for the dif￾ferent effects remains unclear.
Molecular structure and physiological 
function of fibroblast growth factor-23 
(FGF-23)
FGF-23 is a 32-kDa protein with 251 amino acids 
that is synthesized and secreted by bone cells, mainly 
osteoblasts. It is composed of an amino-terminal sig￾nal peptide (residues 1-24), an “FGF-like sequence” 
(residues 25-180), and a carboxyl-terminal extended 
sequence (residues 181-251) [28, 29]. Unlike most 
other members of the FGF family, since FGF-23 con￾tains a signal peptide and has low affinity for heparin, 
it can be distributed throughout the body in the blood 
and act at many distant sites, such as the kidney [30]. 
FGF-23 signals with highest efficacy through four FGF 
receptors (FGFR) bound to the transmembrane pro￾tein Klotho as a coreceptor. Of the four members of 
the FGFR family, FGFR1 and FGFR4 are expressed in 
the distal tubule, FGFR2 is expressed mainly in the 
macula densa, whereas FGFR3 is expressed both in 
the proximal tubule and in the distal tubule [31]. 
FGFR2 is not a likely candidate for mediating FGF-23 
effects in the kidney, because it does not bind to 
FGF-23 [32]. Furthermore, a recent study showed that 
neither FGFR3 nor FGFR4 is the principal mediator of 
FGF-23 effects in the kidney [33], suggesting that 
FGFR1 is the only remaining target for FGF-23 [34]. 
FGF-23 induces urinary phosphate excretion by sup￾pressing the abundance of the Na/Pi IIa and IIc co￾transporters in the brush border of renal proximal 
tubules [35]. In animal studies, transgenic mice 
over-expressing human or mouse FGF-23 have severe 
renal phosphate wasting because of the inhibition of 
renal Na/Pi cotransporter activity [36, 37], whereas 
FGF-23 inactivation (FGF-23 null mice and normal 
mice treated with FGF-23 blocking antibodies) leads 
to hyperphosphatemia [38, 39]. A pioneer study pub￾lished in Nature Genetics revealed that missense mu￾tations in FGF-23 gene are responsible for human 
variants of hypophosphatemic rickets [40]. In addi￾tion, FGF-23 also suppresses 1,25-(OH)2D via 
down-regulation of 1α-hydroxylase and 
up-regulation of 24-hydroxylase which converts 
1,25-(OH)2D into more hydrophilic metabolites with 
lesser biological activity [41, 42]. On the contrary, the 
administration of 1,25-(OH)2D increases circulating 
FGF-23 levels, apparently due to a direct action of 
vitamin D on FGF-23 via a VDRE located upstream of 
the FGF-23 promoter, which may be related to future 
resistance to vitamin D therapy [43, 44].
Metabolism of FGF-23 in CKD
The elevation of serum FGF-23 is a common 
feature in CKD. This occurs as early as stage 2 CKD, 
long before any changes in calcium, phosphate, or 
PTH are apparent [45]. By the time patients reach 
ESRD, FGF-23 concentrations are often 100- to 1000-
fold above the normal range [46], and moreover, cir￾culating FGF-23 in ESRD patients is mostly intact and 
biologically active [47]. Three possible explanations 
could account for the event. First, it appears that the 
massive elevations in FGF-23 levels in CKD reflect 
both increased secretion into and decreased removal 
from the circulation. In the report of Bacchetta et al. 
[48], treatment with corticosteroids could activate 
osteocytes in pediatric CKD patients, and then signif￾icantly stimulate FGF-23 synthesis. On the other hand, 
Westerberg et al. [49] found that FGF-23 levels and 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were in￾versely correlated among individuals with CKD stage 
4-5. Second, the other cause of increased levels of 
FGF-23 may be a compensatory phenomenon to the 
phosphate retention seen in CKD. Perwad et al. [50] 
fed normal mice with low-, medium-, or
high-phosphate diet for 5 days and measured circu￾lating FGF-23 concentrations using an intact FGF-23 
assay. In mice fed with high- (1.65%) phosphate in￾take, the mean serum FGF-23 concentration was 
65±6.5 pg/ml, a value 7-fold higher than that in mice 
fed with the low- (0.02%) phosphate intake, 9.9±1.0 
pg/ml. Ito et al. [51] expressed FGF-23 promoter con￾structs in transiently transfected K562 cells in media 
with various concentrations of phosphate and showed 
an increase in promoter activity with high-phosphate 
medium. Last but most important, vitamin D therapy 
in patients with CKD may also contribute to the in￾creased serum levels of FGF-23. In 5/6 nephrecto￾mized rats, intravenous administration of 
1,25-(OH)2D, three times a week for 2 weeks, 
dose-dependently increased serum FGF-23 [52]. 
FGF-23 may serve as a novel risk marker for the 
cardiovascular mortality in CKD [53]. The ArMORR 
study revealed that high FGF-23 levels in patients 
starting hemodialysis were an independent predictor 
of 1-year mortality after adjustment for serum phos￾phate and PTH levels; and in a multivariable adjusted 
model, subjects whose FGF-23 levels were in the 
highest quartile had nearly a 600% increase in risk as 
compared with subjects in the lowest quartile [54]. In 
addition, in the case of FGF-23, a special characteristic 
could favor its use as a marker: the fact that FGF-23 
concentrations remain stable throughout the day in 
patients with CKD [55]. Although the mechanistic link 
between elevated FGF-23 levels and increased cardi-

ovascular mortality in CKD remains to be answered, 
the data present below focusing on vascular calcifica￾tion, secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), left 
ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and endothelial dys￾function may be supportive of the pathophysiological 
sequence of vitamin D supplement – FGF-23 excess –
cardiovascular susceptibility (Figure 1).
FGF-23 and vascular calcification
Vascular calcification is very prevalent in CKD, 
especially in ESRD. The mechanisms of vascular cal￾cification are hyperphosphatemia and elevated cal￾cium × phosphate product. Vascular calcification in￾duces stiffening of the vessel wall and reduces vas￾cular compliance, which has been found to be predic￾tive of cardiovascular mortality [56]. FGF-23, a major 
phosphatonin, decreases serum phosphate concentra￾tions by directly reducing renal reabsorption, and 
therefore prevents vascular calcification in physio￾logical conditions. FGF-23 null mice on a regular diet 
develop a mineral profile similar to patients who suf￾fer from ESRD and are treated with high-dosage 
vitamin D, namely, elevated serum calcium, phos￾phate and 1,25-(OH)2D levels along with ubiquitous
vascular calcification and decreased survival [38, 57]. 
In the clinical investigation undertaken by Wes￾seling-Perry et al. [58], irrespective of residual renal 
function, serum FGF-23 levels correlated with phos￾phate and calcium × phosphate product. In another 
study, Gutierrez et al. [59] divided 80 patients into 
four CKD groups according to the eGFR, and ob￾served that serum levels of FGF-23 increased as kid￾ney function decline, whereas phosphate values did 
not become abnormal until eGFR fell below 30 
ml/min/1.73m2
. Thus, it seems that during early 
stages of CKD, FGF-23 may contribute to maintaining 
the serum phosphate levels within the normal range. 
This compensation for decreased nephron mass may 
be overcome by severe renal failure when overt hy￾perphosphatemia and vascular calcification develop 
despite markedly increased FGF-23 levels [60]. There 
may be a feedback loop existing between serum vit￾amin D, FGF-23 and mineral disorder. FGF-23 is both 
the cause of abnormal serum calcium and phosphate 
levels and their consequence [61].

FGF-23 and SHPT
As kidney function declines, the elevated serum 
PTH concentrations are frequently the earliest de￾tectable abnormality [62]. Individuals with elevated 
PTH concentrations are at higher risk of cardiovascu￾lar mortality. According to the statistical data report￾ed by Hagström et al. [63], in a community-based co￾hort of 958 elderly men, a 1-SD increase in serum PTH 
was associated with a 37% to 38% higher risk for car￾diovascular mortality in the crude and multivariable 
models. Several mechanisms may account for the link 
between PTH and cardiovascular mortality. First, 
PTH is directly implicated in atherogenesis through
vascular calcification and vascular remodeling [64, 
65]. Second, PTH seems also to have detrimental ef￾fects on the myocardium through induction of LVH, 
cardiac calcification and fibrosis [66-68]. Third, SHPT 
may participate in the pathophysiological mechanism 
of hyperlipidemia seen in chronic renal failure [69]. 
Fourth, higher PTH is related with both established 
cardiovascular risk factors and more recently de￾scribed risk factors such as inflammation markers, 
renal dysfunction and cardiac pathology [63, 70-72]. 
Finally, because PTH is one of the pivotal regulatory 
hormones in the mineral homeostasis, it is possible 
that the serum levels of PTH reflect other abnormali￾ties along the same pathway such as vitamin D defi￾ciency, hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia and renal 
failure, which predisposes to a higher risk for cardi￾ovascular mortality [63].
FGF-23 is located upstream of the PTH molecule. 
A study that measured both FGF23 and PTH in pa￾tients with early CKD and healthy controls suggested
that FGF23 excess precedes PTH excess, because 
FGF23 levels were already twice normal and signifi￾cantly higher in patients with CKD, whereas PTH 
levels were normal and not significantly different 
between patients with CKD and healthy participants 
[73]. Up-regulation of FGF-23 in patients with CKD 
inhibits renal 1α-hydroxylase and results in early 
1,25-(OH)2D deficiency, which may initiate the de￾velopment of SHPT [74]. Two representative ap￾proaches have been employed to identify the signifi￾cant relationship between FGF-23 and PTH in vivo. 
Animal models of expression of FGF-23 demonstrate 
diffuse parathyroid hyperplasia and SHPT [37]; 
FGF-23 null mice have low PTH concentrations due to 
very high serum calcium and 1,25-(OH)2D levels [75]. 
However, the action of FGF-23 on PTH is variable in 
vitro. Krajisnik et al. [76] treated parathyroid cells with 
a stabilized form of recombinant FGF-23 
[FGF-23(R176Q)] and found that FGF-23(R176Q) ex￾erted an obvious effect on cell apoptosis and reduced 
the PTH mRNA level in a dose-dependent manner in 
the concentration rang of 400~2000pg/ml; when the 
FGF-23(R176Q) concentrations were over 2000pg/ml, 
they did not detect any significant effect on cell 
apoptosis, whereas a small but significant increase in 
cell proliferation was observed. In another study, 
Ben-Dov et al. showed that FGF-23 suppressed both 
PTH secretion and PTH gene expression in vitro rat 
parathyriod cultures through the mitogen-activated 
protein kinase pathway [77]. The Ben-Dov and Kraj￾isnik studies are the only data that isolate direct ef￾fects of FGF23 on the parathyroid, independent of 
circulating mineral content. Either provide some evi￾dence to support the statement that “FGF23 sup￾presses PTH”. Conversely, PTH may stimulate 
FGF-23 secretion by osteoblasts, because the FGF-23 
levels of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism 
are increased, which may be reduced by parathy￾roidectomy [78]. The mechanisms by which PTH me￾diates changes in FGF-23 expression remain unclear
and may be ascribed to either direct effects on FGF-23 
gene expression itself or mediation through other po￾tential regulators of FGF-23 [79]. Therefore, FGF-23 
stimulates PTH in vivo or in CKD individuals, 
whereas suppresses PTH in vitro, and is also in￾creased by excess PTH [80]; FGF-23 is an important 
predictor of future SHPT and subsequent cardiovas￾cular mortality in patients undergoing CKD, espe￾cially when serum phosphate and PTH levels are in 
the normal range [81].
FGF-23 and LVH
LVH is a prevalent manifestation of CVD and 
also an independent risk factor for mortality in pa￾tients with CKD [82, 83]. Approximately 40% of pa￾tients with predialysis CKD and up to 80% of patients 
initiating hemodialysis manifest LVH [84, 85]. Insuf￾ficiency of cardiac diastolic and contractive functions, 
inappropriate activation of the ren￾in-angiotensin-aldosterone system, alteration of fluid 
balance and disturbance of collagen are identified as 
the major determinants of LVH in CKD [86]. Several 
near recent studies have demonstrated that elevated 
FGF-23 may be also involved in the LVH onset [47, 
87]. In maintenance hemodialysis patients, serum 
FGF-23 levels were significantly correlated with 
higher mean left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and 
lower mean ejection fraction, irrespective of B-type 
natriuretic peptide and cardiac troponin T [88]. And 
in transgenic mice overexpressing human FGF-23, 
interventricular septum thickness diastolic, left ven￾tricular posterior wall thickness diastolic and LVMI 
relative to body weight were significantly increased, 
which may be attributed to the impaired vascular

reactivity and down-regulation of vasoconstrictor 
receptors (α1-ARs and AT1A) [89]. The cardiac hyper￾trophic effects of FGF-23 are mediated by FGFR acti￾vation and could be blocked in vitro by the FGFR in￾hibitor PD173074, but do not require Klotho as core￾ceptor [90]. Furthermore, matrix metalloproteinases 
dysmetabolism may also act as a close link between 
elevated FGF-23 and LVH in patients with CKD [91].
FGF-23 and endothelial dysfunction
CKD is now considered a typical situation of 
chronic inflammatory state. C-reactive protein (CRP), 
a nonspecific marker of inflammation, is described as 
a fundamental biomarker for endothelial dysfunction 
in patients with CKD [92]. Endothelial dysfunction 
usually describes binding of monocytes to the endo￾thelial surface, down-regulation of nitric oxide activ￾ity, reduced dilatory capacities and an early event of 
arteriosclerosis [93]. Although some data from clinical 
observations have suggested that FGF-23 is associated 
with the elevated levels of CRP in CKD patients [94, 
95], there is scant direct evidence supporting the in￾duction of endothelial dysfunction by FGF-23. To the 
best of our knowledge, pioneer work was conducted 
by Mirze et al. [96] at the Uppsala University Hospital. 
His group found that FGF-23 could reduce endothe￾lium-dependent vasodilation both in healthy subjects 
and in subjects with eGFR<60 ml/min/1.73m2
. A 
more recent report also demonstrated that the high 
log FGF-23 was a significant independent risk factor 
of the increased carotid artery intima-media thickness
in 128 maintenance hemodialysis patients [97]. How￾ever, there is some data suggesting that Klotho, the 
cofactor of FGF-23, can regulate endothelial function. 
In the study of Hu et al. [98], despite induction of 
CKD, Klotho transgenetic mice had preserved levels 
of Klotho and much less vascular calcification com￾pared with wild-type mice with CKD; inversely, 
Klotho-haploinsufficient mice with CKD had unde￾tectable levels of Klotho and severe vascular calcifica￾tion. It is possible that part of the beneficial effects of 
Klotho on endothelial function in CKD result from 
improvement of FGF-23 signal transduction [99]. 
Therefore, further studies in vitro are needed to clar￾ify whether FGF-23 is a marker or a potential initia￾tion for endothelial dysfunction in CKD.
Perspectives
Taken as a whole, the data presented above 
which come from observational or experimental 
studies support the hypothesis that FGF-23 may help 
to explain the biphasic cardiovascular effects of vita￾min D in CKD, according to the cross actions between 
FGF-23 and the multiple metabolic pathways (vascu￾lar calcification, SHPT, LVH and endothelial dys￾function). Therefore, modulation of FGF-23 may be￾come a potential therapeutic target for the lowering of 
cardiovascular risk in CKD.
Several clinical interventions have been em￾ployed to manipulate FGF-23. (1) Decreased phos￾phate intake: Ferrari et al. [100] measured FGF-23 
concentrations in 29 healthy young men who were 
treated sequentially with 5 days of dietary phosphate 
restriction, followed by an equilibration period, then 5 
days of a high-phosphate diet. The mean serum 
FGF-23 concentration decreased 29.1±6.5% during 
phosphate restriction, and increased 31.1±9.5% during 
phosphate supplementation. In addition, dietary 
phosphate modification can also regulate 1,25-(OH)2D 
production, mediated in part by changes in circulat￾ing FGF-23. Antoniucci et al. studied 13 healthy men 
during a 4-week dietary phosphate intervention 
study, and found that serum FGF-23 concentrations 
decreased significantly from 30.7±8.7 pg/ml during 
phosphate supplementation to 19.6±7.0 pg/ml during 
phosphate restriction, accompanied with increased 
1,25-(OH)2D levels from 29±10 pg/ml to 40±16 pg/ml 
[101]. (2) Phosphate binders: A short-term 6-week 
dose titration study evaluated the effects of two 
phosphate binders, sevelamer hydrochloride and cal￾cium acetate, on FGF-23 levels in patients with CKD 
stages 3 to 4. Sevelamer-treated patients presented a 
significant reduction in FGF-23 (107 pg/ml at baseline 
versus 54 pg/ml at the 6th week), whereas this was not 
observed in calcium-treated patients [102]. Conform￾ably, Gonzalez-Parra et al. showed that serum FGF-23 
concentrations in 18 patients with CKD stages 3 were 
significantly decreased after 4 weeks treatment with 
lanthanum carbonate [103]. Even more excitingly, in a 
1-year prospective observational study of incident 
hemodialysis patients, treatment with phosphate 
binders was associated with a significant survival 
advantage compared with no treatment (13.6 versus 
23.5 deaths per 100 person-years) [104]. (3) Cinacalcet 
and concurrent low-dose vitamin D: Wetmore et al. 
[105] used samples from ACHIEVE trial to perform a 
per-protocol analysis of the effects of treatment on 
FGF-23, and they found that the treatment regimen 
using Cinacalcet plus fixed low-dose calcitriol analogs 
could result in a relative decrease in FGF-23 levels 
compared with an approach using escalating doses of 
calcitriol analogs alone, after a 27-week intervention 
period (-9.7% versus 4.1%). (4) C-terminal tail of 
FGF-23: Goetz et al. [106] injected the isolated 
72-residue-long C-terminal tail of FGF-23 into healthy 
rats and demonstrated that it could block the patho￾genic actions of intact FGF-23, which may hold 
promise of providing the first causative pharma-

cotherapy. C-terminal tail of FGF-23, generating an 
endogenous inhibitor of intact FGF-23, removes the 
binding site for the binary FGFR-Klotho complex. (5) 
Renal transplantation: Economidou et al. [107] per￾formed a prospective study to investigate FGF-23 
levels in 18 patients with ESRD before and after renal 
transplantation. Compared with pretransplantation, 
FGF-23 levels decreased by 89% at the end of 3 
months posttransplantation, and moreover, all pa￾tients had normal FGF-23 levels (<50 pg/ml) at 12 
months posttransplantation. The excessive and rapid 
reduction may be due to increased urinary excretion 
[108].
