ABSTRACT
Background Pulmonary hypertension (PH)-targeted
therapy in the setting of pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is
controversial; the main clinical concern is worsening of
systemic hypoxaemia. We sought to determine the
effects of gentle initiation and chronic administration of
parenteral treprostinil on right heart function in patients
with PF associated with an advanced PH phenotype.
Methods Open-label, prospective analysis of patients
with PF-PH referred for lung transplantation (LT).
Advanced PH was defined as mean pulmonary artery
pressure (mPAP) ≥35 mm Hg. We compared
haemodynamics, Doppler echocardiography (DE),
oxygenation, dyspnoea and quality of life indices, and
6 min walk distance (6MWD) before and 12 weeks after
parenteral treprostinil.
Results 15 patients were recruited in the study. After
therapy, there were significant improvements in right heart
haemodynamics (right atrial pressure (9.5 ± 3.4 vs 6.0 ±
3.7); mPAP (47 ± 8 vs 38.9 ± 13.4); CI (2.3 ± 0.5 vs 2.7 ±
0.6); pulmonary vascular resistance (698 ± 278 vs 496 ±
229); transpulmonary gradient (34.7 ± 8.7 vs 28.5 ± 10.3);
mvO2 (65 ± 7.2 vs 70.9 ± 7.4); and stroke volume index
(29.2 ± 6.7 vs 33 ± 7.3)) and DE parameters reflecting
right heart function (right ventricular (RV) end diastolic area
(36.4 ± 5.2 vs 30.9 ± 8.2 cm2
), left ventricular eccentricity
index (1.7 ± 0.6 vs 1.3 ± 0.5), tricuspid annular planar
systolic excursion (1.6 ± 0.5 vs 1.9 ± 0.2 cm)). These
changes occurred without significant alteration in systemic
oxygenation, heart rate, or mean systemic arterial pressure.
In addition, improvements were seen in 6MWD (171 ± 93
vs 230 ± 114), 36-Item Short Form Health Survey Mental
Component Summary aggregate (38 ± 11 vs 44.2 ± 10.7),
University of California, San Diego Shortness of Breath
Questionnaire (87 ± 17.1 vs 73.1 ± 21), and brain
natriuretic peptide (558 ± 859 vs 228 ± 340).
Conclusions PH-targeted therapy may improve right
heart haemodynamics and echocardiographic function
without affecting systemic oxygen saturation in an
advanced PH phenotype associated with RV dysfunction in
the setting of PF.
INTRODUCTION
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) may complicate pul￾monary fibrosis (PF) of different causes, but few
studies have focused on the treatment of advanced
PH in this context.1–4 Furthermore, no prospective
chronic parenteral prostanoid administration studies
are available in patients with PF homogenised for the
less common advanced PH phenotype, characterised
by significantly altered right heart haemodynamics
and right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. We previously
reported a case where the rationale for parenteral tre￾prostinil as a bridge to lung transplantation (LT) was
outlined in the index patient with PF-PH for this
study.5 Importantly, parenteral prostanoid therapy
associated with worsening of ventilation-perfusion
(V-Q) mismatch and subsequent hypoxaemia remains
a major clinical concern. The purpose of this pilot
study was to evaluate the effects of acute and subse￾quent chronic parenteral treprostinil therapy on right
heart haemodynamics and echocardiographic func￾tion in patients with PH referred for LT in the setting
of an advanced PH phenotype and right heart
dysfunction.
Key messages
What is the key question?
▸ What are the effects of parenteral treprostinil
on right heart function of patients with
pulmonary fibrosis (PF) referred for lung
transplantation (LT) with an advanced
pulmonary hypertension (PH) phenotype?
What is the bottom line?
▸ Parenteral treprostinil improves right heart
haemodynamics and echocardiographic
function without affecting systemic oxygen
saturation in PH-PF with an advanced PH
phenotype.
Why read on?
▸ This pilot study suggests parenteral treprostinil
improves right ventricle function and is a safe
therapeutic option in patients with PH-PF with
an advanced PH phenotype; as such, this
approach may be a consideration for patients
with advanced PH-PF if they are ineligible for,
or as a bridge to, LT.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was approved by the IRB at University of California,
Los Angeles (UCLA IRB# 07-11-087-03; clinicaltrials.gov
Identifier NCT00705133). We recruited 15 outpatients with PF
referred to our LT programme between July 2008 and January
2011 who had advanced PH based on right heart catheterisation
(RHC) (figure 1). Sarcoidosis and systemic sclerosis spectrum of
disease were excluded, as were patients requiring >10 L/min of
oxygen at baseline. Importantly, threshold measures of right heart
size and/or function were not required for study enrolment.
Patients with combined pulmonary fibrosis emphysema were
included.6 Formal pulmonary rehabilitation was not prescribed
during the study period.
Advanced PH was defined using haemodynamic criteria:
mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) ≥ 35 mm Hg, pulmon￾ary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) ≤ 15 mm Hg, and pulmonary
vascular resistance (PVR) > 240 dyn s/cm5
. Other PH aetiologies
were ruled out based on current recommendations.7 All
follow-up RHCs were performed after ≥12 weeks of stable dose
background PH-targeted therapy, and background PF-related
therapy remained unaltered during the study period.
Six minute walk distance and oxygen supplementation
protocols
Patients were ambulated per American Thoracic Society criteria
with a modification regarding oxygen supplementation (OS),
given the inherent hypoxaemia in this patient population (see
online supplementary repository).8
Pulmonary function testing and Doppler echocardiogram
protocols
Pulmonary function testing (PFT) was obtained at treprostinil
initiation and at 12 weeks and included forced vital capacity
(FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), FEV1/FVC ratio
and single-breath diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide
(DLCO). Total lung capacity (TLC) was only performed at base￾line. Doppler echocardiogram (DE) was performed using con￾ventional equipment (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, California,
USA) at baseline and 12 weeks (see online supplementary
repository).
Dyspnoea and quality of life assessments
Dyspnoea was measured with the University of California, San
Diego Shortness of Breath (UCSD SOB) questionnaire and the
Borg Dyspnoea Index (BDI) (see online supplementary
repository).
Health-related quality of life was measured with the 36-Item
Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). SF-36 scales are summarised
into Physical Component (PCS) and Mental Component (MCS)
Summary scores. The eight SF-36 scales and the PCS and MCS
scores are standardised to a mean of 50 and an SD of 10 in the
general US population. Minimally important difference (MID)
estimates for SF-36 PCS and MCS are 2.5 points (see online
supplementary repository).
Parenteral treprostinil titration protocol
All patients were hospitalised for 48 h for treprostinil initiation
and uptitration (see online supplementary repository).
High-resolution CT lung parenchymal scoring
Thin slice (<3 mm) CT scans were used for objective assessment
of lung parenchymal abnormality at baseline (see online supple￾mentary repository).
Study parameters
Patient assessments were made at baseline and after 12 weeks of
parenteral treprostinil and included RHC and systemic haemo￾dynamics, echocardiographic parameters, 6 min walk distance
(6MWD), PFT, systemic and central oxygenation, brain natri￾uretic peptide (BNP), and SF-36/UCSD SOB questionnaires.

Statistics
Baseline characteristics were described as frequencies (%) for
categorical variables and means (SD) for continuous variables.
Clinical, haemodynamic, and echocardiographic data were
reported at baseline and 12 weeks, and the Shapiro–Wilk test
was used to assess the normaility of the distributions of baseline
and week 12 data. For variables where normality was rejected at
the p<0.05 level, median (IQR) values were reported and the
Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare DLCO (% pre￾dicted), FVC%/DLCO%, 6 min walk 10 L face mask (FM) (%
saturation), SF-36 Physical Functioning, stroke volume (SV), and
systolic blood pressure (SBP) measures at baseline and week 12.
For all other clinical, haemodynamic, and echocardiographic
variables, mean (SD) were reported and paired t tests were used
to compare variables at baseline and week 12. Q-values were
computed to assess the impact of multiple comparisons in the
domains of pulmonary function, quality of life, and haemo￾dynamics. Analyses were conducted with Stata V.13 (Stata Corp
LP, College Station, Texas, USA), and p values <0.05 were con￾sidered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Demographics
Fifteen patients aged 63 ± 15 years (mean ± SD) (20% female)
referred for LT met all study criteria and agreed to enrolment
(figure 1). Baseline WHO functional class was equally split with
53% class III (n=8) and 47% class IV (n=7). Background PH
therapy (≥12 weeks of stable dose therapy) and the underlying
clinical diagnoses regarding the aetiology of the PF are displayed
in table 1. A subgroup of clinical diagnoses (n=10) had patho￾logical confirmation made by surgical lung biopsy (n=2), even￾tual explantation (n=7), or autopsy (n=1) (see online
supplementary repository table S2). Individual patient data are
presented in the repository (see online supplementary table S1).
The extent of baseline lung parenchymal abnormality by
high-resolution CT (HRCT) chest imaging is reported for each
patient in the repository (see online supplementary table S2).
Safety/adverse events
Of the 15 patients, 14 patients received subcutaneous treprosti￾nil and 1 patient was placed on intravenous treprostinil.5 The
treprostinil dose for the group at 12 weeks was 34 ± 21 ng/kg/
min (mean ± SD) and a range of 18–97 ng/kg/min. During
inpatient treprostinil initiation, there were no changes in vital
signs, particularly oxygen saturation by peripheral pulse oxim￾etry (PPO), or adverse haemodynamic changes that led to
acute discontinuation of the medication. During inpatient and
outpatient treprostinil uptitration, patients experienced typical
prostanoid effects, including jaw pain, diarrhoea, lower
extremity bone pain, site pain/reaction, headache, and/or
flushing.9
Pulmonary function testing, 6MWD, and oxygen status
The mean (±SD) baseline % predicted values for FEV1, FVC,
TLC, and FEV1/FVC ratio were 62 (17), 62 (21), 70 (15), 77
(11), and 24 (13), respectively and the median (IQR) baseline %
predicted value for DLCO was 24 (13); for the cohort of
patients without CPFE (n=12), baseline TLC was 67 (16).
There were no significant changes in PFT parameters following
12 weeks of treprostinil (table 2). Comprehensive individual
patient data are presented in the repository (see online supple￾mentary table S3).
The baseline 6MWD (mean ± SD) was 171 ± 93 m with a
resting room air pulse oximetry of 83 ± 7%. All except one

patient required oxygen supplementation at rest; 11 of 15
(73%) required ≥3 L of oxygen supplementation at rest.
Table 2 shows the 6MWD improvements following 12 weeks
of parenteral treprostinil therapy (mean 59 m; p<.001).
Specifically, 8 of 15 patients improved by ≥57 m (range 57–
150); 5 improved by ≥17 m (range 17–30); and 2 patients
each declined by 10 m (figure 2). At 12 weeks, there were no
significant differences in baseline oxygen requirements (see
online supplementary repository figure S1) or oxygenation
parameters by PPO either at rest on room air, at rest on 10 L
FM, or at the completion of the 6MWD test on 10 L FM
(table 2). Individual patient data are presented in the reposi￾tory (see online supplementary table S3).
SF-36, UCSD SOB and BDI assessments
Patients had a statistically significant improvement in UCSD
SOB and SF-36 MCS scores at the end of the study (p<0.05;
table 3). When we assessed the clinical significance of these
improvements, 77% and 50% had improvement ≥MID esti￾mates for UCSD SOB and SF-36 MCS, respectively.
Additionally, there was no significant change in SF-36 PCS and
BDI (table 3) between baseline and 12 weeks. Individual patient
data are presented in the repository (see online supplementary
table S4).
Haemodynamics, BNP and Doppler echocardiography
All 15 patients had baseline mPAP ≥ 35 mm Hg; 10 (66%) had
mPAP ≥ 40 mm Hg and 7 (47%) had mPAP ≥ 50 mm Hg. The
transpulmonary gradient (TPG) at baseline was ≥20 mm Hg for
all patients and ≥30 mm Hg in 12 of 15 (80%) patients. The
average PVR was 698 ± 278 dyn s/cm5
, representing 44% of
the mean systemic vascular resistance (SVR). The baseline PVR
was ≥480 dyn s/cm5 in all but three patients. Following
12 weeks of treprostinil, there was evidence of decreased RV
afterload, as per significant reductions in mPAP, TPG, PVR, and
increased pulmonary capacitance (table 4; see online supple￾mentary repository figure S2). Right heart function improved,
as per reductions in right atrial pressure and increased mixed
venous oxygen saturation, cardiac index and SV index (table 4).
Although the SBP fell by 11 mm Hg (124 ± 21 to 113 ±
13 mm Hg; p=0.028), the mean systemic arterial pressure was
not altered and there was a downward trend in the PVR/sys￾temic vascular resistance (SVR) ratio (p=0.060), suggesting pro￾portionally greater pulmonary than systemic vasodilation.
Importantly, there were no significant changes in resting heart
rate, arterial oxygen content, or oxygen delivery. Individual
patient data are presented in the repository (see online supple￾mentary table S5).
The two-dimensional echocardiographic examination at base￾line revealed normal left ventricular cavity size (LV end-diastolic
dimension 4.1 ± 0.5 cm) and systolic function (LV ejection frac￾tion 64 ± 6%), and Doppler evidence of normal left atrial pres￾sure (transmitral Doppler E/e’ ratio 5.4 ± 1.4). In contrast,
subjects were noted to have severe RV dilatation (RV end￾diastolic area 36.4 ± 5.2 cm2
), marked right-to-left displacement
of the interventricular septum (systolic eccentricity index 1.7 ±
0.6) and moderate RV systolic dysfunction (tricuspid annular
planar systolic excursion (TAPSE) 1.6 ± 0.5 cm; see online sup￾plementary repository figure S3). Doppler estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure at baseline was 72 ± 12 mm Hg. The RV
outflow tract (RVOT) acceleration time was markedly reduced
(66 ± 16 ms) and 100% of subjects showed evidence of systolic
flow deceleration or ‘notching’ of the RVOT Doppler envelope.
Of note, 85% of subjects showed evidence of both a TAPSE
<2.0 cm and RVOT Doppler notching, consistent with
afterload-dependent RV dysfunction at baseline.
Figure 3 illustrates that following 12 weeks of parenteral tre￾prostinil treatment, there were significant reductions in RV size
(p=0.021), less evidence of interventricular septal flattening

(p=0.037), and improved RV systolic function (p=0.006). In
parallel with haemodynamic and echocardiographic evidence of
RV unloading, BNP levels fell significantly in subjects at
12-week follow-up (table 4).
Patient status
Of the 15 patients, 8 were actively listed for LT (figure 1). Of
the 7 patients not offered LT, 5 died (mean ± SD) 504 ±
295 days after treprostinil initiation, while 2 patients remained
alive 1059 and 1401 days after treprostinil initiation. After
active listing, 7 patients were successfully bridged to LT which
occurred at a median of 268 days (range 140–1379 days) after
the baseline RHC and treprostinil initiation. The remaining
listed patient died 272 days after treprostinil initiation.
DISCUSSION
The purpose of this investigation was to assess the effects of
chronic parenteral treprostinil administration on right heart
haemodynamics and echocardiographic function in a PF popula￾tion referred for LT with an advanced PH phenotype, charac￾terised by significantly increased PVR and RV dysfunction.10 We
studied this population either as a bridge to LT or to achieve
clinical stabilisation in otherwise transplant ineligible patients at
risk of clinical deterioration due to advanced PH and right heart
dysfunction.5 7 10 Significant improvements were demonstrated
in right heart haemodynamics and echocardiographic function
in response to chronic parenteral treprostinil infusion, without
significant decrement in peripheral oxygen saturation, arterial
oxygen content, or oxygen delivery.
At baseline, our subjects had a markedly elevated PVR, mod￾erate to severe RV dysfunction, and thus abnormal coupling
between the RV and pulmonary vascular load. In the context of
significant RV–pulmonary artery uncoupling, RV afterload
reduction leads to a predictable, afterload-dependent improve￾ment in right heart function, as was seen in our cohort by way
of improved haemodynamics and echocardiographic para￾meters.11 These improvements in RV afterload and RV function
(enhanced RV coupling) likely augmented the circulatory
reserve of our patients, explaining their functional advantage
and decreased dyspnoea.
The potential for worsening gas exchange with PH-targeted
therapy deserves particular attention. We did not appreciate any
significant hypoxaemia as assessed by PPO after treprostinil
therapy, either at rest or after 6MWD testing. Importantly, pul￾monary function (ie, degree of PF) remained unaltered during
the study and did not likely confound these findings. Although
arterial blood gases (ABG) were not obtained to confirm this
finding, we can suggest a rationale based on the available litera￾ture. Prior work using multiple inert gas elimination technique
(MIGET) has demonstrated a relatively preserved V-Q spectrum
at rest, manifesting absent or mild resting hypoxaemia in
patients with either WHO Group I pulmonary arterial hyperten￾sion (PAH)12 or isolated PF.13 Importantly, during exercise, the
MIGET-derived V-Q spectrum remains preserved in both condi￾tions, despite predictable widening of the alveolar-arterial gradi￾ent and hypoxaemia.13–15 In PAH, this hypoxaemia is driven by
a low mixed venous pO2,
14 while in PF, hypoxaemia is charac￾terised by a relative augmentation in diffusion abnormality,
which in turn is further accentuated by low mixed venous oxy￾genation.16 Consequently, a PH-targeted therapy that augments
mixed venous oxygenation may be particularly desirable in a
cohort of patients with PF and advanced PH to attenuate any
predisposition for hypoxaemia at rest or during exercise.

The use of acute15 or chronic17–20 PH-targeted, non-prostanoid
therapy does not appear to alter gas exchange in patients with
PF without advanced PH during rest or exercise, which chal￾lenges the notion of predictable V-Q inequality and hypoxaemia
as a direct result of underlying fibrotic lung disease. Despite this
finding, acute parenteral prostanoid administration in patients
with PF and advanced PH raises concern for predictable intra￾pulmonary shunt and hypoxaemia.3 21 Interestingly, even
patients with PAH (WHO Group I) demonstrated increased
shunt by MIGET during acute parenteral prostanoid administra￾tion.22 The question is whether this potential shunt and hypox￾aemia are related to the parenteral route of administration or to
the aggressive uptitration strategy routinely implemented when
initiating parenteral prostanoid therapy.23 In fact, prior studies
evaluating acute parenteral prostanoid administration in PAH22
and PF associated with advanced PH3 21 employed this same
aggressive uptitration protocol and report relatively worsened
gas exchange, V-Q spectrum, and systemic haemodynamic data
specifically at the prostanoid dose associated with intolerable
adverse reaction and/or unacceptable haemodynamic deterior￾ation. Similar and predictable V-Q inequality has also been
demonstrated with other aggressively titrated, non-prostanoid
vasodilators in patients with PAH.24
This approach may result in undesired physiology driven by
decreased SVR, including reflex tachycardia, increased cardiac
output (CO), systemic hypotension, and unchanged or increased
PVR/SVR ratio. Comparable untoward physiology was recently
demonstrated after riociguat therapy in patients with PF and
advanced PH with resultant mild hypoxaemia.25 While a patient
with PAH may be able to tolerate an aggressive uptitration of
parenteral prostanoid,22 this strategy may place a patient with
PF and advanced PH at risk of acute cardiopulmonary decom￾pensation.3 Consequently, a more gradual parenteral prostanoid
uptitration approach may attenuate shunt physiology and subse￾quent hypoxaemia, especially if significant systemic vasodilation
and the resulting abrupt rise in CO are avoided. Cardiac output
may itself be associated with increased intrapulmonary shunt.26
Based on the above, we surmise that a gentler uptitration of par￾enteral prostanoid, as employed in our study PF population
with advanced PH, may lessen the potential for haemodynamic
instability and/or hypoxaemia and rather parallel the chronic
parenteral prostanoid administration haemodynamic and gas
exchange data reported in WHO Group I PAH.
The inclusion of patients restricted to a severe baseline PH
phenotype likely decreased the predisposition to arterial oxygen
desaturation in response to treprostinil. Our subjects had a mark￾edly elevated PVR and borderline reduced CO at baseline with
evidence of significantly improved right heart function following
treprostinil infusion, delineated by less septal bowing, a falling
right atrial pressure, and improved CO. These salutary effects on
right heart function may further optimise arterial oxygen content
via enhanced mixed venous oxygen saturation.16 27
The improvement of 59 m in 6MWD following 12 weeks of
parenteral treprostinil was noted in parallel with improvements
in the UCSD SOB questionnaire and the SF-36 MCS, represent￾ing preliminary but encouraging findings. Recent independent
studies in subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and
Group I PAH suggested the minimally clinically important sig￾nificant 6MWD difference to be 24–45 m and 25–38 m,
respectively.28 29 The augmentation in functional capacity seen
in our subjects with PF-PH in response to treprostinil does not
contravene prior studies reporting a lack of improvement in
functional parameters in patients with PF treated with
PH-targeted therapies.17–19 Patients in these prior studies had
no or mild PH, while our subjects had an average
mPAP>45 mm Hg, a markedly elevated PVR, and degrees of
RV dilatation and dysfunction comparable to severe WHO
Group I PAH.30
These physiological differences are likely critical when consid￾ering the potential response to PH-targeted therapies, given that
patients with advanced lung disease in the absence of advanced
PH typically do not possess evidence of a circulatory limitation
to exercise.31 32 In contrast, patients with parenchymal lung
disease (COPD or PF) and advanced PH demonstrate (in add￾ition to their inherent ventilatory limitation) a circulatory limita￾tion on exertion and an overall cardiopulmonary exercise stress
test profile similar to isolated Group I PAH, with blunted
oxygen pulse and marked ventilatory inefficiency (ie, increased
VE/VCO2).31 32 Importantly, the moderate degree of restrictive
lung disease in our patient cohort may not have warranted con￾sideration of LT, had it been isolated from the severe extent of
superimposed PH. Interestingly, a recent post hoc analysis of a
placebo-controlled randomised clinical trial in IPF20 showed
that the subgroup of patients with, compared with those
without, RV dysfunction and RV hypertrophy improved their
6MWD in response to sildenafil.33 In addition, the Royal
Brompton group retrospectively reported a significant 6MWD
improvement with sildenafil in a mixed interstitial lung disease
population with pulmonary function and right heart haemo￾dynamics similar to our experience.2
The combined observations of improved right heart function
and stable arterial oxygen saturation in our PF-PH cohort after
chronic parenteral treprostinil suggests the advanced PH pheno￾type may be critical when considering PH-targeted therapy, as it
lends itself towards an increased likelihood of improved circula￾tory reserve and decreased risk of hypoxaemia. As such, an
advanced PH phenotype in the context of chronic respiratory
disease may be essential for predicting a beneficial response and
minimising potential adverse effects of therapy.
LIMITATIONS
Limitations of this study include the heterogeneity of the PF
population, variable background PH-targeted therapy, and the
absence of ABG testing. The absence of a placebo arm is a par￾ticularly significant limitation; therefore, our findings must be
confirmed with a randomised, placebo-controlled trial. At this
point, the routine use of PH-targeted therapy in PF-PH is not
recommended and should only be cautiously considered at spe￾cialised PH centres to avoid the serious potential for worsening
cardiopulmonary status in this patient population. In addition,
the explanation proposed for the lack of significant hypoxaemia
with parenteral prostanoid in our PF-PH cohort remains specu￾lative and requires further investigation. To address the limita￾tion of multiple comparisons in the domains of pulmonary
function, quality of life, and haemodynamics, we calculated that
observed p values < 0.05 corresponded to a maximum q-value
of 0.067, indicating that the proportion of significant findings
attributable to false discovery is small. As such, we were reas￾sured to see encouraging results in a real-world cohort of
patients with PF referred for LT, characterised by an ‘advanced
PH and right heart dysfunction’ phenotype. The lack of ABG
testing is offset by stable arterial oxygen content, oxygen deliv￾ery, and oxygen saturation values at rest and 6MWD testing, fol￾lowing treprostinil therapy.
CONCLUSION
This open-label study suggests that gradual initiation and
chronic administration of parenteral treprostinil therapy may

improve haemodynamics and right heart function without com￾promising systemic oxygenation in an advanced PH phenotype
with RV dysfunction in the setting of PF. These findings are
only hypothesis generating and require confirmation in a multi￾centre, randomised study design. Future studies of PH-targeted
therapy for PF should focus on patients with PF with the com￾bination of advanced PH and RV dysfunction, as these subjects
may have greater capacity for benefit. Finally, given the high
mortality inherent to this population, a future study may con￾sider survival as an endpoint.
