Abstract
Background: Deaths from liver cirrhosis have increased at least 8 fold since the 1970's in the UK
and further increases are anticipated, whereas in the rest of Europe liver deaths are decreasing. In
the UK, we urgently need strategies to detect those who misuse alcohol and are at risk of
developing alcoholic liver disease before they get to that point. One potential strategy is to screen
admissions to hospital with alcohol related conditions for evidence of alcohol misuse.
Surprisingly, there has been no research into the important question of where the opportunities
are to detect those who misuse alcohol – primary or secondary care. We attempted to answer
this firstly by conducting a retrospective analysis of the medical notes of 94 patients diagnosed with
alcohol induced liver cirrhosis between 1st January 1995 and 31st December 2000 at Southampton
General Hospital with the purpose of identifying admissions to hospital prior to a diagnosis of
alcoholic liver disease. In the second part of the study, we interviewed patients with alcoholic liver
disease about their contact with health services.
Results: Before diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease, 33% (31/94) of the patients had had an
admission to hospital for an alcohol related condition. There was a mean of 7 years and 1 month
(SD 6 years 3 months) between the first alcohol-related admission and presentation with alcoholic
liver disease (in those who had had admissions). The commonest reason for alcohol related
admission was falls/fractures/injuries, followed by non-variceal gastro-intestinal bleeds. Patients
with alcoholic liver disease who were interviewed had seen their General Practitioner on average
at least 2 times per year.
Conclusion: Most patients who develop alcohol-induced cirrhosis do not have an admission to
hospital with an alcohol related condition before developing alcoholic liver disease. Therefore, if
we screen patients admitted to hospital with alcohol related conditions for evidence of alcohol
misuse, we could potentially detect around a third of those at risk of developing cirrhosis. Although
secondary care has an important role to play in detecting those at risk, the main opportunity for
detection is in primary care.

Background
Deaths from liver cirrhosis have increased at least 8 fold
since the 1970's and further increases are anticipated
whereas in the rest of Europe liver deaths are decreasing
[1]. Rates of cirrhosis are directly influenced by alcohol
consumption in a population and alcohol consumption
doubled in the UK between 1960 and 2002 [2]. The UK
Government Alcohol Strategy reported that alcohol causes
at least 22,000 deaths and costs the UK £15 billion every
year [3]. Data from the General Household Survey shows
that 27% of UK men and 17% of women drink more than
the government recommended maximum of 21 and 14
units/week [4]. Of these, 5% of men and 3% of women
drink more than 50 or 35 units/week – the level where
liver disease starts to become a major health risk. Many of
these individuals will develop significant liver disease
(alcoholic hepatitis/cirrhosis) – a clinical process which is
usually entirely silent with no signs or symptoms [5,6]
and the majority of these patients will not have estab￾lished alcohol dependency [7]. Of those that present with
a sudden variceal haemorrhage or decompensated liver
disease with ascites, one third will die within a month, a
further third will die within a few months and only one
third will survive long term [8,9], figures which have not
improved in the UK over the last 35 years [8]. With such
high mortality figures when patients present for the first
time with cirrhosis, the emphasis must be on detection
and treatment of these individuals before they reach this
point.
The Royal College of Physicians published a report in
2001 entitled 'Alcohol – Can the NHS (National Health
Service) Afford it' [10] suggesting various strategies to
combat the UK's growing alcohol problem. It recom￾mended screening those who are admitted to hospital
with an alcohol related condition, for example, head inju￾ries or drug overdose for evidence of alcohol misuse. The
best way of screening was thought to be some kind of
questionnaire, for example, AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disor￾ders Identification Test) which identifies hazardous drink￾ers. It also suggested that it may even be necessary to
screen all admissions to hospital, whatever the reason.
The UK Government subsequently published an 'Alcohol
Harm Reduction Strategy for England' in 2004 [11] which
was criticised for failing to address the health issues.
Brief interventions are an effective way to detect and treat
those with hazardous drinking patterns and are usually
used in primary care, although can be used in other set￾tings, for example, Accident and Emergency Departments.
They involve 5–10 minutes of advice given on an oppor￾tunistic basis when patients attend for other problems.
Brief intervention works in half of subjects [12] and when
liver disease is diagnosed at least half stop drinking. 90%
of people visit their General Practitioner (GP) in a 5 year
period [13] meaning that primary care potentially plays a
pivotal role in detection and treatment of alcohol misus￾ers.
So where are the opportunities to detect hazardous and
harmful alcohol drinkers, in primary (General Practice) or
secondary (hospital) care? This is the question we
attempted to answer in this study firstly using a retrospec￾tive clinical review of patients with alcohol-induced liver
cirrhosis and secondly by interviewing patients with alco￾holic liver disease about their contact with primary and
secondary care before being diagnosed with alcoholic
liver disease. Surprisingly, we have not been able to find
any previous studies addressing this very important ques￾tion.
In this study we show that most patients who develop
alcohol-induced liver cirrhosis do not have an admission
to hospital for an alcohol related condition before devel￾oping alcoholic liver disease, but that they do have contact
with primary care.
Methods
Retrospective analysis of hospital records and a prospec￾tive interview study in patients presenting with alcohol
related liver disease. Ethical approval was obtained for
both parts from the local ethics committee (Part 1 – Isle of
Wight, Portsmouth and South East Hampshire Local Eth￾ics Committee ref no 06/Q1701/19, Part 2 – Southamp￾ton and South West Hampshire Ethics Committee (B) ref
No 400/02/S/W) and conformed to the principles
embodied in the Declaration of Helsinki.
1) Retrospective clinical review of patients with alcohol￾induced liver cirrhosis
All patients who had a liver biopsy between 1st January
1995 and 31st December 2000 at Southampton General
Hospital were identified from the pathology department
computer system. The reports of these biopsies were
reviewed and any containing a diagnosis of cirrhosis
(including incipient or imminent cirrhosis) and a histo￾logical picture suggestive of alcohol were flagged up for
the study (n = 109). It is our policy to make a histological
diagnosis in patients with significant liver failure via a
transjugular biopsy, but restricting the study population
to biopsy proven cirrhosis would have excluded some
subjects with less significant liver disease. This was a delib￾erate decision to ensure a homogeneous study popula￾tion. The clinical history was reviewed to corroborate that
there was a history of excess alcohol. Any without this his￾tory were excluded from the study on the basis that they
were probably non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and any
with any other form of significant liver co-morbidity eg
hepatitis C were excluded, leaving 104 patients. All our
patients undergo serological testing for viral hepatitis. The

clinical notes were reviewed and complete data was
obtained on 94 patients (in 4 the notes could not be
found and in 6 only partial data could be obtained and
therefore these patients were excluded from data analy￾sis).
The socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of this
group were as follows: 52 male, 42 female; mean age 49
years 2 months; 69 had ascites at the time of biopsy (25
did not); 45 had varices at the time of biopsy (24 did not
and 25 were unknown); 10 were Childs-Pugh Grade A, 42
were Grade B, 40 were Grade C and 2 were unknown.
The date at which each patient was first identified as hav￾ing alcoholic liver disease was recorded and this was
defined as either presenting with alcoholic hepatitis or cir￾rhosis, or having a biopsy showing alcohol-induced cir￾rhosis. Any admissions to hospital prior to this diagnosis
were identified and were further divided into incidental
admissions (no apparent relation to alcohol, for example,
elective operations) and alcohol related admissions
(including drug overdose, non-variceal gastro-intestinal
bleeds, pancreatitis, fractures, head injuries etc).
2) Interview study of patients with alcoholic liver disease
Patients with alcoholic liver disease were recruited from
the liver wards and liver outpatient clinics at Southamp￾ton University Hospitals NHS Trust. 45 subjects were
identified and interviewed as part of a wider study into
alcohol. Part of this study used a locally developed ques￾tionnaire to determine contact with health care services
regarding alcohol intake and alcohol related health prob￾lems. Specifically the questions asked were 'when was the
first time, if ever, that you came to the attention of a health￾care professional as a result of excessive alcohol intake?', 'how
many times have you seen your GP in the last five years', 'have
you ever been admitted to hospital/seen in Accident and Emer￾gency for alcohol related problems in the past? If yes give details
and provide number of days spent in hospital due to alcohol'.
Subjects were not considered suitable for interview if they
were experiencing hepatic encephalopathy or severe with￾drawal symptoms.
Data were recorded and analysed using Microsoft Excel
and SPSS.
Results
1) Retrospective clinical review of patients with alcohol￾induced liver cirrhosis
Overall, 38 patients out of 94 total (40%) had had an
admission to hospital for any reason before being diag￾nosed with alcoholic liver disease and the average number
of admissions per subject (in those who had had an
admission) was 2.8 (SD 2.1). This included 31 patients
(33%) who had had an admission to hospital for a reason
that might have been classed as alcohol related before
being diagnosed with alcoholic liver disease and the aver￾age number of alcohol related admissions was 2.3 (SD
2.1). 67% had therefore had no admission to hospital for
an alcohol related condition.
The mean length of time between the first admission to
hospital for any reason (incidental or alcohol related) and
being diagnosed with alcoholic liver disease was 10 years
and 4 months (SD 7 years 0 months). The mean length of
time between the first alcohol related admission to hospi￾tal and being diagnosed with alcoholic liver disease was 7
years and 1 month (SD 6 years 3 months). The reasons for
alcohol related admissions are shown in table 1. 17% of
patients (16/94) died within 3 months of their first pres￾entation with alcoholic liver disease. Only 6 of these
patients had had a prior admission to hospital with an
alcohol related condition.
2) Interview study of patients with alcoholic liver disease
Patients presented after an average of 16 years of heavy
drinking to health services. In response to the question
'how many times have you seen your GP in the last five years',

those who were still drinking had seen their GP a mean of
9 times per year (16–44 age group) or 13 times per year
(45–64 age group). Those who were abstinent had seen
their GP a mean of 2 times per year (16–44 age group) or
6 times per year (45–64 age group).
In response to the question 'Have you ever been admitted to
hospital/seen in Accident and Emergency for alcohol related
problems in the past?' there was a mean of 3 admittances/
attendances per subject (range 0–17). Subjects had spent
a mean of 23 days as an inpatient.
Discussion
Retrospective clinical review of patients with alcohol￾induced cirrhosis showed that before being diagnosed
with alcoholic liver disease, most of the patients (67%)
did not have an admission to hospital with an alcohol
related condition during which they could have been
screened for alcohol misuse. This therefore has implica￾tions for targeting of resources as most of these patients
would need to have been detected in primary care. If there
was an effective means to screen 100% of all admissions
to hospital, then out of this cohort of patients a maximum
of 40% could have been detected as hazardous drinkers.
There was a mean of approximately 2 opportunities for
detection ie admissions to secondary care in those who
did present as such. Slightly more admissions were found
in the interviews where the patients with alcoholic liver
disease had attended a mean of 3 times per subject.
16 of the 94 patients died within 3 months of their first
presentation with alcoholic liver disease. This is extremely
important because these patients probably had no warn￾ing of the harm they were causing their liver and the first
time they became aware of it, they had presented with a
fatal condition. These patients had no chance to stop
drinking and change the course of their illness because it
was too late. If we can identify these patients and give
them advice about their drinking before they develop cir￾rhosis, this at least gives them a chance to stop drinking.
Simply telling someone they have alcoholic liver disease
is enough to stop patients drinking or make them reduce
their drinking to safe levels in just over half of patients in
our experience (see below). Of the16 patients, only 6 had
had a prior admission to hospital with an alcohol related
condition, and therefore again, the main opportunity for
detection and treatment would have been in primary care.
In those who presented to secondary care with an alcohol
related condition, the mean time difference between the
first presentation and detection of alcoholic liver disease
was approximately 7 years. We know that around half of
subjects respond positively to a brief invention [12] and
similar results were seen in a cohort of heavy drinkers
screened with gamma GT resulting in a significant reduc￾tion in liver morbidity [14]. Therefore if we can detect
patients before they develop end stage liver disease we are
likely to be able to reduce their alcohol consumption and
thus avoid the development of cirrhosis in a substantial
proportion. An audit recently carried out in Southampton
showed that of 124 patients with alcoholic liver disease
who survived one year after development of alcoholic
liver disease, 54% were abstinent or drinking within liver
safe levels (N. Sheron, personal communication). Patients
were not given specific therapy for alcohol dependence,
and thus figures represent the response of medical advice
about their liver disease.
The first part of the study used only patients with cirrhosis
who had had a biopsy, which was a deliberate attempt to
study the patients with the most severe liver disease. All
patients in Southampton with evidence of significant
alcohol related liver disease are biopsied at some stage, so
we felt this was a good way to detect patients with cirrho￾sis and that a large proportion would not be missed.
Because only patients with alcohol-induced cirrhosis were
selected, patients with non-cirrhotic but otherwise signif￾icant liver disease were not included because of this, for
example those with alcoholic hepatitis and fibrosis and
could lead to suggestion of selection bias. We feel that this
actually strengthens our study as we used the patients who
developed the most severe liver disease and most were not
picked up by the health care system.
In the interview part of the study, patients had been drink￾ing heavily for an average of 16 years before they pre￾sented to health services. In other words, there is a long
'latent' period in which we can detect patients who are
drinking harmfully or hazardously during which we could
reduce or stop their drinking. Most patients who develop
alcoholic liver disease are not physically alcohol depend￾ent [7].
A survey of drinking in adults conducted in the UK by the
Office for National Statistics in 2004 showed that 11% of
male drinkers and 8% of female drinkers had had a dis￾cussion with either their GP, someone else at the GP sur￾gery, a doctor elsewhere or another medical person
elsewhere about their drinking of alcohol in the last year
[15]. Of the 11% of male drinkers who had this discus￾sion, 9% of the discussions had been with their GP or
someone else at the surgery, and only 2% had been with
a doctor elsewhere or another medical person elsewhere
and similar results had been obtained for women.
This study suggests that there is a place for detection of
harmful and hazardous drinkers by screening admissions
to secondary care, but we cannot rely on this alone as
most patients would not be picked up this way. Primary
care therefore probably has the biggest role to play in

detection of alcohol misusers. The FAST test was specifi￾cally developed to detect hazardous drinking and not just
dependency, it takes 13 seconds and has a sensitivity and
specificity of around 90% [16]. The wider use of this test
followed by appropriate stepped interventions along the
lines of those used in Copenhagen have the potential to
reduce liver deaths. Detailed strategies for detection and
management of heavy drinkers in primary care have been
previously published [17]. In order to detect alcohol mis￾users in General Practice, there needs to be screening for
alcohol intake and liver disease, but until we do that,
deaths will not reduce.
Conclusion
We have increasing rates of liver cirrhosis in the UK,
directly related to increasing alcohol consumption. Strat￾egies to identify those at risk of developing alcoholic liver
disease, including cirrhosis are urgently needed. Patients
who misuse alcohol can be identified using question￾naires, which can be administered in primary or second￾ary care. The Royal College of Physicians have
recommended as one strategy to screen admissions to
hospital with alcohol related conditions for evidence of
alcohol misuse.
In this study, we showed that most patients who develop
alcohol-induced cirrhosis are not admitted to secondary
care with an alcohol related condition (or any condition)
before they develop alcoholic liver disease. Thus the
opportunities to detect them as alcohol misusers in sec￾ondary care before they develop alcoholic liver disease are
limited. Patients with alcoholic liver disease who were
interviewed had on average at least 2 episodes of contact
with primary care per year and 90% of people visit their
General Practitioner in a 5 year period, meaning that pri￾mary care is ideally placed for detection of those who mis￾use alcohol.
In summary, there are opportunities to detect patients at
risk of developing alcoholic liver disease in secondary care
but this study suggests that the majority of detection needs
to be done in primary care. In this study, patients had
been drinking heavily for an average of 16 years before
presenting to health services and therefore there is ample
opportunity to detect and treat those at risk of developing
alcoholic liver disease before they cause significant dam￾age to their health.
