Abstract
Background: Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs), which are extremely stable and protected from RNAse-mediated degradation
in body fluids, have emerged as candidate biomarkers for many diseases. The present study aimed to identify a serum
microRNA (miRNA) expression profile that could serve as a novel diagnostic biomarker for primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC).
Methods: Serum miRNA expression was investigated using four cohorts comprising 380 participants (healthy controls and
patients with PBC) recruited between August 2010 and June 2013. miRNA expression was initially analyzed by Illumina
sequencing using serum samples pooled from 3 patients and 3 controls. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was then used to evaluate the expression of selected miRNAs in a screening set (n = 40). A logistic
regression model was then constructed using a training cohort (n = 192) and validated using another cohort (n = 142). The
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to evaluate diagnostic accuracy.
Results: We identified a miRNA panel (hsa-miR-122-5p, hsa-miR-141-3p, and hsa-miR-26b-5p) with a high diagnostic
accuracy for PBC (AUC = 0.905, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.857 to 0.953; sensitivity = 80.5%, specificity = 88.3%). There
was a significant difference between AUC values of the miRNA panel and those of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (AUC = 0.537,
difference between areas = 0.314, 95% CI = 0.195 to 0.434, P,0.001), and those of antinuclear antibody (ANA) (AUC = 0.739,
difference between areas = 0.112, 95% CI = 0.012 to 0.213, P = 0.0282).
Conclusion: We identified a serum microRNA panel with considerable clinical value in PBC diagnosis. The results indicate
that the miRNA panel is a more sensitive and specific biomarker for PBC than ALP and ANA.

Introduction
Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a female predominant,
progressive autoimmune disease characterized by immune-medi￾ated destruction of the intrahepatic bile ducts. PBC characteristic
serologic hallmark is the anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA), a
highly disease-specific autoantibody found in 90–95% of patients
and less than 1% of normal controls [1]. AMA directed against the
E2 subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme complex
located in the inner mitochondrial membrane is the most
important reference standar [2]. However, fewer than 5% of
patients with PBC are AMA-negativ [3]. PBC diagnosis is
established based on the following criteria: (1) biochemical
evidence of cholestasis, (2) the presence of AMA, and (3)
histopathologic evidence of nonsuppurative cholangitis and
destruction of the interlobular bile duct [4]. Though diagnostic
criteria have been determined, the progression to biochemically
and clinically apparent disease is unpredictable. Many patients are
diagnosed at an early stage of disease and respond well to medical
therapy, while some patients will require liver transplantatio [5].
To revolutionize the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of PBC,
new biomarkers should be identified. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are
emerging as highly tissue-specific biomarkers with potential
clinical applicabilit [6].
MiRNAs are an emerging class of highly conserved, non-coding
small RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcrip￾tional level. It is now clear that miRNAs can potentially regulate
every aspect of cellular activity, including differentiation and
development, metabolism, proliferation, apoptotic cell death, viral
infection, and tumorigenesis [7]. Recent studies provide clear
evidence that miRNAs are abundant in the liver and modulate a
diverse spectrum of liver functions [8]. Deregulation of miRNA
expression may be a key pathogenic factor in many liver diseases,
including viral hepatitis, hepatocellular cancer, and polycystic liver

disease. A clearer understanding of the mechanisms involved in
miRNA deregulation would offer new diagnostic and therapeutic
strategies to treat liver diseases. Circulating miRNAs, which are
extremely stable and protected from RNAse-mediated degrada￾tion in body fluids, have emerged as candidate biomarkers for
many diseases [9,10,11]. The use of miRNAs as noninvasive
biomarkers is of particular interest in liver diseases [12,13,14].
Since the initial study by Qin et al. [15], 17miRNAs have been
identified to be differentially expressed in PBMCs from patients
with PBC. Ninomiya et al. [16] also found that the down￾regulation of hsa-miR-505-3p and miR-197-3p expression can
serve as clinical biomarkers of PBC.
Our study investigated miRNA expression profiles with
independent validation in a large cohort of participants, in order
to identify a panel of miRNAs for the diagnosis of PBC. The
cohort included healthy individuals and patients with PBC.
Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of
The Third Hospital Affiliated to Jiangsu University (No. 201002)
and written informed consent was obtained from each patient
prior to participation. The study was conducted in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Study design, patients, and healthy controls
A multistage, case-control study was designed to identify a
serum miRNA profile as a surrogate marker for PBC (Fig. 1). A
total of 207 patients with PBC and 173 healthy controls were
enrolled in our study. In the biomarker discovery stage, 6 serum
samples pooled from 3 healthy control donors and 3 patients with
PBC were subjected to Illumina Hiseq 2000 deep sequencing to
identify miRNAs that were significantly differentially expressed. In
the biomarker selection stage, the expression of different miRNAs
was validated by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in samples from 20 patients with PBC
and 20 healthy controls. Subsequently, samples from 102 patients
with PBC and 90 healthy controls were used in the training set.
Sequential validation was performed using a hydrolysis probe￾based qRT-PCR assay to refine the number of serum miRNAs as
a PBC signature, while samples from an additional 82 patients
with PBC and 60 healthy controls serum samples were used in an
independent validation set. All patients were diagnosed with PBC
between August 2010 and June 2013 (from The Third Hospital of
Zhejiang Affiliated Jiangsu University) and blood samples were
collected prior to any therapeutic procedure. Patients who had
abnormal liver enzyme values regardless of histologic stage were
receiving ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in a dose of 13–15 mg/
kg/day orally. PBC diagnosis can be established when two of the
following three criteria are met: (1) biochemical evidence of
cholestasis based mainly on alkaline phosphatase (ALP) elevation,
(2) presence of AMA, and (3) histologic evidence of nonsuppura￾tive destructive cholangitis and destruction of interlobularbile duct
[4]. The clinical phases were divided into four phases: preclinical,
asymptomatic, symptomatic, and liver insufficienc [17]. Patients
with other disorders such as drug-induced liver disease, alcoholic
liver disease, viral hepatitis, schistosomiasis, autoimmune hepatitis,
sclerosing cholangitis, a1-antitrypsin deficiency, hemochromatosis,
Wilson’s disease, and biliary obstruction were excluded. Healthy
control subjects were recruited from a large pool of individuals
seeking a routine health check-up at the Healthy Physical
Examination Centre of The Third Hospital of Zhejiang Affiliated
Jiangsu University. The healthy controls were also required to
have normal ALT level (ALT,40 IU/mL) and no history of
coronary heart disease, hypertension, valvular disease, any
arrhythmia, or systemic disease for inclusion in the study. The
controls and patients were matched based on age, gender, and
ethnicity.
RNA isolation and library preparation
About 5 mL of venous blood was collected from each
participant. The whole blood was separated into serum and
cellular fractions by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 10 min,
followed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min for complete
removal of cell debris. The supernatant serum was stored at –80uC
until analysis. Total RNA was isolated using LCS TRK1001 miR￾Neasy kit (LC Sciences, Hangzhou, China). The libraries were
constructed from total RNA using the Illumina Truseq Small
RNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, RNA 39 (P￾UCGUAUGCCGUCUUCUGCUUG-UidT) and 59 (GUUCA￾GAGUU CUACAGUCCGACGAUC) adapters were ligated to
target miRNAs in two separate steps. Reverse transcription
reaction was applied to the ligation products to create single

stranded cDNA. The cDNA was amplified by PCR using a
common primer and a primer containing the index sequence
(CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGA). The quantity and purity of
total RNAs were monitored using a NanoDrop ND-1000
spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA) at a
260/280 ratio .2.0. The integrity of total RNAs was analyzed
using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system and RNA 6000 Nano
LabChip Kit (Agilent Tech, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with RNA
integrity number .8.0. Finally, Illumina sequencing technology
was employed to sequence these prepared samples.
Illumina sequencing and data analysis
The raw sequences were processed using the Illumina pipeline
program. After masking of the adaptor sequences and removal of
contaminated reads, the clean reads were filtered for miRNA
prediction with the software package ACGT101-miR-v4.2 (LC
Sciences, Houston, Texas, USA) and subsequently analyzed
according to report [18]. Secondary structure prediction of
individual miRNAs was performed by Mfold software (Version
2.38; http://mfold.rna.albany.edu/?q=mfold/RNA-Folding-Form)
using the default folding conditions. The raw data were reduced to
cleaned sequences by removal of the following sequences: (1)
3ADT&length filter: reads were removed due to 3ADT not being
found and reads with length ,18 and .26 were removed; (2) Junk
reads: Junk: $2N, $7A, $8C, $6G, $7T, $10Dimer, $6Trimer,
or $5Tetramer; (3) Rfam: Collection of many common non-coding
RNA families except miRNAs (http://rfam.janelia.org); (4) Repeats:
Prototypic sequences representing repetitive DNA from different
eukaryotic species (http://www.girinst.org/repbase); (5) Notes:
There was an overlap in mapping reads with mRNA, rRNA,
tRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, and repeats; (6) mRNA Database: (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The clean sequence reads were mapped
with miRBase 20.0, allowing a mismatch of one or two nucleotide
bases. The computational pipeline employed for data handling is
reported in the flowchart of the study procedure (Figure S1). All data
were transformed to log base 2. Differences between the samples
were calculated using chi-square and fisher’s exact test. Only
miRNAs with fold difference .2.0 and P,0.05 were considered
statistically significant.
qRT-PCR validation study and data analysis
Relative quantification of miRNAs by qRT-PCR (300 mL of
serum from each participant) was performed with SYBR Premix
Ex Taq (TaKaLa) according to the manufacturer’s instructions
using a Rotor-Gene 3000 Real-time PCR machine (Corbett Life
Science, Sydney, Australia). The RT primers and realtime PCR
primers were designed as previously describe [19]. Briefly, 1 mg of
total RNA was reverse transcribed under the following conditions:
16uC for 15 min, 42uC for 60 min, and 85uC for 5 min. The PCR
total volume was 20 mL and included 1 mL of RT product and
1 mL EvaGreen dye (Biotium, Hayward, CA, USA). The PCR
reaction conditions were as follows: 95uC for 5 min followed by 40
cycles of 95uC for 15 s and 60uC for 1 min using an ABI PRISM
7300 thermal cycler. All reactions were run in triplicate. The
threshold cycle (Ct) is defined as the fractional cycle number at
which the fluorescence passes the fixed threshold. According to
previous studies, miRNA-24 is consistently expressed in human
serum [20,21]. Moreover, our previous experience is that miRNA￾24 expression is stable and that its expression level can serve as an
internal control in serum miRNA relative quantitative analysis.
The specificity of each PCR product was validated by melting
curve analysis at the end of PCR. All samples were analyzed in
triplicate and the cycle threshold value was defined as the number
of cycles required for the fluorescent signal to reach the threshold.

reads were reduced to 659,447 and 482,263 clean reads, indicating 54.26% and 50.29% of sequenced reads, respectively (Fig. 2A, 2B). The distribution
of all reads from 16 to 30 nt is presented in Fig. 2C.

miRNA relative expression levels in serum were calculated using
the formula 22DDCt where DDCt = [Ct (target, test)2Ct (ref,
test)]2[Ct (target, calibrator)2Ct (ref, calibrator)] [22]. All
primers used were obtained from Invitrogen (Shanghai, China).
Statistical analysis
All Illumina sequencing data were transformed to log base 2.
Differences between the samples were calculated using chi-square
and fisher’s exact test. Only miRNAs with fold difference .2.0
and P,0.05 were considered statistically significant. Data are
presented as median 6 SD. Demographic and clinical character￾istics of patients with PBC and healthy controls were analyzed
using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version
21.0 software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). For miRNA 22DDCt
values obtained by qRT-PCR, Mann-Whitney unpaired test was
used to compare the results from patients with PBC to that of the

healthy controls. A stepwise logistic regression model was used to
select diagnostic miRNA markers based on the training dataset.
The predicted probability of being diagnosed with PBC was used
as a surrogate marker to construct the receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve. Area under the ROC curve (AUC)
was used as an accuracy index for evaluating the diagnostic
performance of the selected miRNA panel. The ROC and
regression analysis was performed using the software 21MedCalc
(Version 10.4.7.0; MedCalc, Mariakerke, Belgium). All P values
were two-sided.
Results
Description and clinical features of the patients with PBC
All 207 patients enrolled in the present study were clinically
diagnosed with PBC. As shown in Table 1, there was no
significant difference in the distribution of smoking, alcohol
consumption, age, and gender between patients with PBC and
normal subjects. However, the total bilirubin (TBIL), ALT, AST,
and ALP of patients with PBC were significantly different from
those of the normal controls.
Global analysis of miRNAs by deep sequencing
The Illumina Hiseq 2000 sequencing of the small RNA library
from the serum of healthy controls and patients with PBC
produced 8,580,434 and 9,371,001 raw-reads, respectively. After
extensive preprocessing and quality control, these raw reads were
reduced to 659,447 and 482,263 clean reads, indicating 54.26%
and 50.29% of sequenced reads, respectively (Fig. 2A, 2B, Table
S1). The distribution of all reads from 16 to 30 nt is presented in
Fig. 2C. In our study, we found that the miRNA length was
mainly 18 and 24 nt. The clean reads were then mapped to the
human miRNA database v20.0 (ftp://mirbase.org/pub/mirbase/
CURRENT/), pre-miRNA (mirs) database v20.0 (ftp://mirbase.
org/pub/mirbase/CURRENT/), and genome database (ftp.ncbi.
nih.gov/genomes/H sapiens/Assembled chromosomes/seq/). A
total of 1,768 unique reads could be mapped to human miRNAs
or pre-miRNAs in miRbase and the pre-miRNAs could be further
mapped to the human genome and expressed sequence tag.
Analysis of differentially expressed miRNAs
The differential expression of miRNA count data was normal￾ized and the number of individual miRNA reads was standardized
by the total numbers of 1,000,000 reads in each sample.
Comparing the PBC and healthy control groups, 126 miRNAs
presented significant differential expression levels. Among them,
17 miRNAs were upregulated (fold change .2-fold, P,0.05) in
the control group,1 was downregulated (fold change .2-fold, P,
0.05), as shown in Table 2.
Differential Expression Profile of Five Selected miRNAs
The expression of 17 candidatemiRNAs that were selected from
the previous step was confirmed by qRT-PCR in an independent
cohort of 40 serum samples. Threshold levels were found to be as
follows: miRNA Ct ,35 and detection rate .75%. We
determined the 22DDCt of 17 candidate miRNAs in the two
groups, Mann-Whitney unpaired test was used to compare
miRNA expression between patients with PBC and controls. Five
of the 17 miRNAs presented significantly different expression

the training set, samples from 102 patients with PBC and 90
controls were examined by qRT-PCR. This phase generated a list
of 5 miRNAs that presented a significant differential expression
pattern (Fig. 3, Table 4), hsa-miR-122-5p, hsa-miR-34a-5p, hsa￾miR-141-3p, hsa-miR-26b-5p, and hsa-miR-27b-3p. The diag￾nostic accuracy of these miRNAs, as measured by AUC, was
0.788, 0.662, 0.647, 0.791, and 0.571, respectively (Table S2,

predictors (Threshold: Enter variable, if P,0.05;remove variable,
if P.0.1,). The predicted probability of being diagnosed with PBC
was determined from the three miRNA panel logit model (Table

performance for the established miRNA panel was evaluated using
ROC analysis. The miRNA panel AUC was 0.876 (95%
CI = 0.829 to 0.924; sensitivity = 75.5%, specificity = 74.4%,
Fig. 5A).
Validating the miRNA panel
The parameters estimated from the training data set were used
to predict the probability of being diagnosed with PBC using the
independent validation set (142 serum samples). Similarly, the
predicted probability was used to construct the ROC curve. The
AUC of the miRNA panel was 0.905 (95% CI = 0.857 to 0.953;
sensitivity = 80.5%, specificity = 88.3%, Fig. 5B).
Using the same serum samples, we compared the AUC of the
miRNA panel with that of ALP. There was a significant difference
between the miRNA panel AUC and ALP AUC (AUC = 0.537,
Difference between areas = 0.314, 95% CI = 0.195 to 0.434, P,
0.001; Fig. 6A). The results indicate that the miRNA panel is a
more sensitive and specific biomarker than ALP for PBC. We also
compared the AUC of the miRNA panel with that of individual
miRNAs (Fig. 6B, Table S4). There was a significant difference
between the miRNA panel AUC values and those of individual
miRNAs. The results indicate that the miRNA panel has a higher
sensitivity and specificity for PBC than has-miR-122-5p, hsa-miR￾141-3p, and hsa-miR-26b-5p alone. Moreover, we also compared
the miRNA panel AUC with that of ANA and AMA. There was a
significant difference between the AUC of the miRNA panel and
that of ANA (AUC = 0.739, difference between areas = 0.112,
95% CI = 0.012 to 0.213, P= 0.0282; Fig. 7A). However, the
sensitivity and specificity of the miRNA panel was less than that of
AMA (AUC = 0.982, difference between areas = 0.130, 95%
CI = 0.0618 to 0.198, P = 0.0002; Fig. 7B).
Evaluation of the miRNA panel significance in different
clinical phases
The diagnostic performance of the miRNA panel in different
clinical phases was further evaluated (Fig. 8A–D, Table S5). The
corresponding AUCs for patients with different clinical phases

respectively. This indicated that the diagnostic performance of the
miRNA panel was independent of the disease status, making it an
optimal diagnostic tool.
Discussion
Since circulating miRNA was found to be stable in serum in
2007, many studies were designed to assess its possible use as a
novel and promising biomarker in body fluids. To date, circulating
miRNAs have been used as biomarkers in the clinic for cancer
detection, non-invasive diagnosis testing, and more [23,24,25,26].
The expression profile of circulating miRNA in serum can be
analyzed by qRT-PCR, microarray, and next generation sequenc￾ing technolog [27]. Although qRT-PCR has been used as the gold
standard to quantify miRNAs, it could only detect limited
numbers of miRNAs at once. Microarray, as a high-throughput
technology, allows the detection of large numbers of miRNAs, but
only known fragments can be detected, and this technology does
not detect low versus abundant miRNAs or distinguish miRNAs
with single nucleic acid polymorphisms. Compared to these two
methods, the next-generation sequencing technology seemed to be
more suitable for miRNA profiling. The Roche 454 Genome
Sequencer, the Illumina Genome Analyser, and ABI SOLiD
System sequencing platforms have become widely available over
the past few years.
Recent studies have demonstrated that miRNA expression
patterns are disease and tissue specific. miRNAs are abundant in
the liver and modulate a diverse spectrum of cellular processes
associated with liver injury such as inflammation, apoptosis, and
hepatocyte regeneration. Deregulation of miRNA expression may
be a key pathogenic factor in many liver diseases, including viral
hepatitis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), metabolic and acute
liver diseases. miRNA expression profiles are altered in many
hepatic diseases compared to that of healthy subject
[28,29,30,31,32]. Hepatocyte apoptosis and necrosis also induce
the release of cellular miRNAs directly into the circulation,
explaining the superior sensitivity of serum miRNA levels
compared to ALT or AST levels in liver damage diagnosis. Bala
et al. have shown that miR-122 and miR-155 were predominantly
associated with protein aggregates in acetaminophen-induced liver
necrosis, whereas in alcoholic liver disease associated inflamma￾Figure 8. The miRNA panel in different clinical phases in the validation set. A: The corresponding AUCs for patients with preclinical phase,

tory damag [8,33]. A number of miRNAs are abundantly
expressed in the liver. miR-122 is liver specific. miR-122is
estimated to make up 70% of the total hepatic miRNA
complement and is expressed at high levels [34]. Therefore,
miRNA-122 has been the first to be used in miRNA therapeutic
trials since 2008 [35]. Inhibition of miR-122 expression in mice
leads to down-regulation of cholesterol- and lipid-metabolizing
enzymes [36]. miR-122 is known to regulate metabolic pathways
in the liver, including cholesterol biosynthesis [37,38]. Circulating
miR-122 levels have been reported to correlate with liver
histological stage, inflammation grades, and ALT activity
[34,35,36,38,39]. miR-141-3p belongs to miR-200 family. Kout￾saki et al. [40] showed the aberrant expression of the miR-200
family (miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-141, and miR-429)
in ovarian carcinoma and its involvement in ovarian cancer
initiation and progression. The miR-200 family members seem to
be strongly associated with a pathologic epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) and to have a metastasis suppressive role. Qiu
et al. [41] demonstrated that miR-141-3p inhibited human
stromal (mesenchymal) stem cell (hMSC) proliferation by G1 cell
arrest. miR-141-3p inhibited osteoblast differentiation of hMSC as
evidenced by reduced alkaline phosphatase activity, gene expres￾sion, and in vitro mineralized matrix formation. Yan et al. [42]
showed that serum miR-26b-5p may be linked to the toxic effects
of perfluorooctanoic acid such as hepatotoxicity, immunotoxicity,
and developmental toxicity.
PBC, like most polygenic autoimmune diseases, clearly belongs
to the ‘‘complex disease’’ category that is attributable to the
combined effects of multiple environmental and behavioral
influences and genetic element [43]. All these elements can lead
to autoimmune pathology such as PBC. Although many studies
demonstrated PBC pathophysiological process, the specific process
is still unknown. Recently, some studies have examined the
association between PBC and gene expression. MiRNA expression
levels have been shown to be significantly different between
patients with PBC and healthy control [16,44,45]. Qinet et al. [15]
analyzed the differential expression profile of microRNA in
PBMCs from four PBC patients and four healthy controls using
a microRNA array. A total of 17 microRNAs were found to be
differentially expressed, 11 microRNAs were upregulated and 6
microRNAs were downregulated in PBC patients. Ninomiya et al.
[16] employed Illumina deep sequencing for the initial screening
of miRNA expression in 10 PBC, 5 patients with chronic hepatitis
B, 5 patients with chronic hepatitis C, and 5 healthy controls. The
circulating levels of hsa-miR-505-3p, 197-3p, and 500a-3p were
significantly decreased in patients with PBC compared with
healthy controls. Thus, more carefully constructed studies are
needed to clarify PBC pathogenesis., The analysis of these
differentially expressed miRNAs could serve in identifying
biomarkers or lead to a better understanding of PBC underlying
molecular mechanism [16]. Kerstien et al. [46] also found that a
total of 35 independent miRNAs were differentially expressed in
PBC and normal liver by histological analysis. The predicted
targets of these miRNAs are known to affect cell proliferation,
apoptosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, and metabolism.
Compared with other PBS diagnosis studies on circulating
miRNAs, our study is unique. First, we screened a large number of
serum miRNAs via deep sequencing, which enabled us to better
identify potential diagnostic markers. Further, we established a
miRNA-panel for PBC diagnosis and revalidated the panel in a
large number of serum samples. Moreover, we compared the
AUC of the miRNA panel with those of ALP and other miRNAs
such asmiRNA-122 and our data indicate that the diagnosis value
of the miRNA panel is superior to that of other non-invasive
markers in patients with PBC.
In summary, we identified a serum miRNA panel that
differentiates patients with PBC from healthy controls with a high
degree of accuracy in a large number of participants. Our study
demonstrates that this serum miRNA panel has a considerable
clinical value for the diagnosis of PBC.
