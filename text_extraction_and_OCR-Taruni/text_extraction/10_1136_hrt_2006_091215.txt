Abstract
Background: Surgical closure of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)
with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults carries higher
risk than in children.
Objectives: To investigate the application of self-expandable
occluders for transcatheter closure of PDA associated with severe
pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults, and the assessment of
immediate and short-term results.
Methods: 29 adult patients (6 men, 23 women) underwent
attempted transcatheter closure of PDA at a mean (standard
deviation (SD)) age of 31.1 (11.4) years (range 18–58 years) and a
mean (SD) weight of 54.1 (7.1) kg (range 42–71 kg). On the basis of
haemodynamic and clinical data obtained before and after trial
occlusion, the final duct occlusion was determined and carried out.
Radiographs of the chest, electrocardiograms and echocardiograms
were used for follow-up evaluation of the treatment within 1 day, 1
month and 3–6 months after successful closure.
Results: 20 of the 29 patients had successful occlusion (group 1),
and 9 patients failed (named group 2). In group 1, in which
occlusion was successful, mean (SD) pulmonary arterial pressures
decreased markedly after trial occlusion: 78 (19.3) mm Hg (range


50–125 mm Hg) before occlusion and 41 (13.8) mm Hg (range 23–
77 mm Hg) after occlusion. Systemic arterial oxygen saturation was
found to be >90% in 19 patients and <90% in the remaining
patient before inhalation of oxygen, and >95% during inhalation of
oxygen or after occlusion in all 20 patients. In group 2, the
occlusion was not successful, because in two patients the device was
not available; another two patients showed worsening of symptoms.
The other five patients showed increased pulmonary arterial
pressures after trial closure; their mean (SD) pulmonary arterial
pressures increased by 10.3 (6) mm Hg (4–16 mm Hg) after trial
occlusion, and systemic arterial oxygen saturation was 85.5%
(2.6%) (range 82.6–88%) before inhalation of oxygen and 94.7%
(1.7%) (range 90.7–99.1%) during inhalation of oxygen. In group 1,
the dimensions of the left atrium, left ventricle and pulmonary
artery increased considerably in 3–6-months of follow-up compared
with those of preocclusion.
Conclusions: Transcatheter closure is an effective treatment for
adults with PDA associated with reversible severe pulmonary
arterial hypertension. Further research is needed for the evaluation
of long-term results.
