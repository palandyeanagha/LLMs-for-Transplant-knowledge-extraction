Abstract
Numerous small observational studies have shown that gastro-
oesophageal reflux is prevalent among patients with advanced lung
disease. The fundamental concern is that reflux is a risk factor for
recurrent microaspiration, which may cause lung injury. For
example, in lung transplant patients, a molecular marker of
aspiration was a risk factor for the bronchiolitis obliterans
syndrome in one study. To date, however, there are no large
prospective studies measuring the impact of aspiration on clinical
outcomes. The major obstacle limiting the study of reflux and
aspiration in patients with advanced lung disease is the absence of a
reliable diagnostic tool. Proximal oesophageal acid detection by pH
monitoring is the only widely available measure of aspiration risk.
Impedance monitoring may be a superior measure of aspiration risk
as it measures both acid and non-acid reflux episodes. Molecular
markers of aspiration, such as pepsin or bile salts in the
bronchoalveolar lavage or exhaled breath condensate, may be the
optimal diagnostic tests, but they are not currently available outside
the research setting. Larger observational studies are needed to
determine the following: (1) the clinical significance of aspiration in
patients with advanced lung disease and in patients who have had
lung transplantation and (2) the diagnostic test that best predicts
adverse outcomes.
