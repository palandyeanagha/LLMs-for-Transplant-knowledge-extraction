Abstract
Background
Despite direct-acting antivirals (DAA), aims to “eradicate” viral hepatitis by 2030 remain
unlikely. In Nepal, an expert consortium was established to treat HCV through Nepal earth￾quakes aftermath offering a model for HCV treatment expansion in a resource-poor setting.
Methodology/Principal findings
In 2015, we established a network of hepatologists, laboratory experts, and community￾based leaders at 6 Opioid Substitution Treatment (OST) sites from 4 cities in Nepal screen￾ing 838 patients for a treatment cohort of 600 individuals with HCV infection and past or cur￾rent drug use. During phase 1, patients were treated with interferon-based regimens (n =
46). During phase 2, 135 patients with optimal predictors (HIV controlled, without cirrhosis,
low baseline HCV viral load) were treated with DAA-based regimens. During phase 3, IFN￾free DAA treatment was expanded, regardless of HCV disease severity, HIV viremia or drug
use. Sustained virologic response (SVR) was assessed at 12 weeks.
Median age was 37 years and 95.5% were males. HCV genotype was 3 (53.2%) or 1a
(40.7%) and 32% had cirrhosis; 42.5% were HIV-HCV coinfected. The intention-to-treat
(ITT) SVR rates in phase 2 and 3 were 97% and 81%, respectively. The overall per-protocol
and ITT SVR rates were 97% and 85%, respectively. By multivariable analysis, treatment at
the Kathmandu site was protective and substance use, treatment during phase 3 were asso￾ciated with failure to achieve SVR.

Conclusions/Significance
Very high SVR rates may be achieved in a difficult-to-treat, low-income population whatever
the patient’s profile and disease severity. The excellent treatment outcomes observed in this
real-life community study should prompt further HCV treatment initiatives in Nepal.
Author summary
Despite very effective antiviral therapies, Hepatitis C virus (HCV) eradication remains a
major challenge, especially in resource-limited countries. In Nepal, which ranks among
the poorest countries in the world an expert consortium was established to treat HCV
patients in six centers throughout the country.
A cohort of 600 individuals with HCV infection and past or current drug use were
treated using different treatment strategies over time. Very high treatment response rates
were achieved in a difficult-to-treat, low-income population whatever the patient’s profile
and disease severity and despite the severe 2015 earthquakes in Nepal. The excellent treat￾ment outcomes observed in this real-life community study should prompt further HCV
treatment initiatives in Nepal.
Introduction
Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major public health problem worldwide, affect￾ing more than 71 million people and responsible for 400,000 deaths per year [1]. Treatment of
HCV infection has undergone a recent revolution since the advent of direct-acting antiviral
(DAA) agents achieving virological cure in more than 90% of patients [2] with simplified treat￾ment regimens with increased tolerability and efficacy compared to prior regimens of inter￾feron (IFN) and ribavirin. These new therapies brought optimism about potential eradication
of HCV, and in 2016 the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a program to “eradi￾cate” viral hepatitis by 2030 [3]. In low-income countries, the price of HCV treatment and lack
of diagnosis remain obstacles to the broad implementation of DAA regimens.
Nepal is a small South Asian country located between India and China with a population of
29 million inhabitants. It ranks among the poorest countries in the world. In the mid-1990s,
the HCV seroprevalence in the general population was estimated at 0.6% [4] and in 2008,
0.66% [5]. Though prevalence estimates in the general population are low, they are higher
among IVDU with a prevalence of detectable HCV RNA of 42% [6]. In 2016, an estimated
130,000 individuals were infected by HCV in Nepal [7]. Sadly due to a lack of awareness and
health infrastructure and poverty, only a small fraction of the infected population has access to
treatment [7].
Until 2014, there was no national program for surveillance, treatment, and prevention of
HCV in Nepal. In May 2014, an Expert Consortium proposed to validate short-course IFN￾based HCV treatment in Nepal based on data suggesting favorable characteristics of the popu￾lation for response to IFN-based therapy [6]. We conducted a prior study demonstrating pre￾dominantly HCV genotype 3 (59.8%) along with HCV genotype 1 (40.2%) [6]. At that time,
IFN and ribavirin were the only approved drugs in Nepal for HCV treatment and the DAAs
remained out of reach. We developed guidance for immediate HCV treatment using shortened
treatment with pegylated (PEG)-IFN and ribavirin when baseline HCV RNA level was low

and when rapid virological response (RVR) could be achieved. With the support of Global
Fund and Deutsche Gesellschaft fu¨r Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH (German
Development Cooperation) and through Save the Children, we provided free access to HCV
treatment for 600 patients. Once the DAAs became available in Nepal, we revised the protocol
and obtained DAA regimens. In this paper, we describe this large-scale treatment initiative
with regard to patients and HCV characteristics and treatment outcomes for those treated
with DAAs. Those treated with IFN-based regimen during phase 1 are described in S1 Appen￾dix and S1 Table. During the protocol period, Nepal faced the severe Gorkha earthquake on
April 25, 2015 with subsequent quakes and aftermath. There were nearly 22,000 people injured
and 9,000 people killed. All study sites were within the areas affected by the earthquakes.
Material and methods
Ethics statement
This study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Nepal Health Research Council
(NHRC). All patients gave their written inform consent.
We created a collaborative research network between existing hepatologists, laboratory
experts, and existing community-based opioid substitution therapy (OST) and HIV care cen￾ters in Nepal with rolling enrollment and treatment from 2015–2018.
Patients
Patients were recruited from 6 OST sites located in 4 cities: Biratnagar, Dharan, Pokhara,
and Kathmandu (3 geographical sites), Nepal (Fig 1). All sites were within areas affected by
the severe Gorkha Earthquake that occurred in 2015; Kathmandu sites were most severely
hit.
Personnel
In each city (n = 4) we engaged 2 doctors (2 hepatologists overall and 6 general practitioners),
2 nurses, 1 community focal person, 1 community worker and 1 phlebotomist.
Inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) active HCV infection by rapid and viral load testing;
with or without HIV-infection, documented by HIV rapid or viral load testing, (ii) Residing in
either Kathmandu, Pokhara, Dharan or Biratnagar and (iii) willing and able to make weekly
visits for care and research follow-up, as required for at least 1 year. In phase 2, criteria
restricted HIV-infected individuals with (a) undetectable HIV viral load, (b) CD4%>14 (CD4
200), (c) stable ARV regimen for minimum 8 weeks. In phase 3, criteria were modified to
include HIV-infection regardless of HIV treatment regimen, CD4 level or HIV viral
suppression.
Non-inclusion criteria included: (i) patients unable to provide consent for inclusion in the
study; (ii) pediatric patients (age < 18); (iii) any social issues that precluded patients to main￾tain routine follow-up appointments.
After written informed consent was obtained from all patients, demographical data and
biological parameters (CD4 cell count, complete blood cell count, creatinine, liver transami￾nases) were collected. Fibrosis was assessed using the APRI score and in some cases using tran￾sient elastography (Fibroscan). We monitored substance use, HCV treatment literacy, and
adherence (by timely follow-up and frequency of consultation with medical staff and social
workers). Patients were monitored with lab draw and clinic visit, substance use and depression
score at time 1, 2 weeks and then monthly until completion. Monthly or bimonthly support
group meetings were conducted at OST sites.

HIV testing
HIV testing was carried out using Point of Care Kit (Determine HIV rapid test, Alere Medical,
Japan). If positive results were observed, then second Point of Care Kit (Unigold HIV rapid
test, Trinity Biotech, Ireland) was used to confirm. In case of discordant results from two tests,
a third and last Point of Care Kit (Tridot HIV Test, J.Mitra & CO, India) test was employed.
Clients testing HIV positive were subjected to HIV viral load quantification on SaCycler-96
Real Time PCR System (Sacace Biotechnologies, Italy) using an HCV Real TM-Quant Dx kit
(Sacace Biotechnologies, Italy),
HCV testing
HCV rapid test was by Point of Care Kit (Tridot HCV test, J. Mitra& CO, India). All screened
patients, regardless of HCV rapid test results, had HCV quantification performed on a SaCy￾cler-96 Real Time PCR System (Sacace Biotechnologies, Italy) using an HCV Real TM-Quant
Dx kit (Sacace Biotechnologies, Italy) able to estimate viral load up to 100,000,000 IU/ml.

HCV Genotyping was performed using the HCV Genotype-Real TM kit (Sacace Biotech￾nologies, Italy) able to detect HCV genotypes 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4, 5a and 6. Patients were also tested
for hepatitis B virus (HBV) coinfection using hepatitis B surface antigen screening.
Rapid virologic response (RVR) was defined as undetectable HCV RNA at 4 weeks of ther￾apy and sustained virological response (SVR) as undetectable HCV RNA 12 weeks after the
end of treatment [8].
HCV treatment
Three phases according to treatment regimen are distinguished. Phase 1 (interferon-based reg￾imens) is described in S1 Appendix and S1 Table.
Phase 2 treatment began in March 2016, with DAA-based regimens. HCV- and HIV-HCV
patients infected with genotype 1 without or with compensated cirrhosis were treated with 12
weeks sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (Natco Pharma, India–approved in Nepal November 2015) and 12
weeks sofosbuvir/ledipasvir/ribavirin, respectively. Patients with genotype 3 received
PEG-IFN/ribavirin/sofosbuvir therapy for 12 weeks if they had all optimal predictors (HIV￾negative, low fibrosis score, low baseline HCV viral load) and RVR; or sofosbuvir/daclatasvir
(Natco Pharma–approved in Nepal March 2016) (12 weeks) or sofosbuvir/daclatasvir +/- riba￾virin (24 weeks) (compensated cirrhotics).
Phase 3 treatment started in August 2017. Due to transition to entirely DAA-based treat￾ment (with ribavirin added for cirrhotic patients), the protocol was modified to expand treat￾ment for all patients, regardless of HCV disease status, HIV viremia or drug use. Patients were
excluded if they were unlikely to tolerate treatment for medical reasons or inaccessible for fol￾low-up. This phase included those with decompensated cirrhosis. HCV- and HIV-HCV
patients infected with genotype 1 with or without compensated cirrhosis were treated with 12
weeks sofosbuvir/ledipasvir/ribavirin and 12 weeks sofosbuvir/ledipasvir, respectively. Patients
infected with genotype 3 or another or unknown genotype received sofosbuvir/daclatasvir (12
weeks) or sofosbuvir/daclatasvir +/- ribavirin (24 weeks) (compensated or decompensated
cirrhosis).
Statistical analysis
Qualitative data are presented as numbers and percentages and quantitative variables as
median and interquartile range [IQR]. A uni- and multivariable logistic regression analysis
was conducted to identify factors potentially associated with SVR12. Variables with a p-value
<0.10 in univariable analysis were entered into the multivariable model. A p-value<0.05 was
considered as statistically significant. All analyses were performed using R (R Foundation for
Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
Results
We screened 838 patients who reported hepatitis C infection; most had prior diagnosis based
on only HCV Ab testing (Fig 2). Among them, 780 were HCV Ab positive or HCV Ab nega￾tive/HCV RNA positive (n = 3); overall 701 (90%) had detectable viremia.
Phase 2 (Treated March-November 2016)
During phase 2, 116 patients qualified for DAA therapy and 19 patients qualified for IFN￾based therapy with sofosbuvir; 135 in total. Median age was 37 years [IQR 33–41] and 97.8%
were males (Table 1). The most frequent genotype was 1a observed in 69 patients (51.1%) fol￾lowed by genotype 3 observed in 56 patients (41.5%). Ten patients had either another or an

unspecified genotype. Median pretreatment viral load was 5.9 log IU/mL. Sixty-eight patients
(50.4%) were HIV-HCV coinfected; three had a detectable HIV viral load. Forty-eight patients
(35.6%) had compensated cirrhosis. Patients were treated with sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (44.4%),
sofosbuvir/daclatasvir (25.2%), or PEG-IFN/ribavirin/sofosbuvir (14.1%) (Table 2).
None of 135 patients treated exhibited severe adverse events (SAE) related to the treatment
protocol. One of 135 had SAE unrelated to treatment protocol, resulting in death. This 41
year-old HIV-HCV coinfected patient with a high CD4 count who received sofosbuvir/ledi￾pasvir died from (TB-negative) pneumonia several weeks after treatment completion. Ten
other patients had minor complaints (skin rash, anemia); none required medication change or
discontinuation. Three patients dropped out of the protocol before completing treatment; two
for drug use relapse. Three patients developed clinical tuberculosis (TB) during (n = 2) or after
(n = 1) DAA-based therapy (without interferon). SVR was achieved in 131 patients (97.0%).

Phase 3 (Treated August 2017-January 2019)
A total of 419 patients were treated during phase 3, all treated after the Gorkha earthquake.
Median age was 37 years [IQR 33–42] and 95.2% were males. Genotype 3 was observed in
230 patients (54.9%) followed by genotype 1a in 163 patients (38.9%). Median pretreat￾ment viral load was 6.2 log IU/mL. HIV-HCV coinfection was present in 175 patients
(41.8%). Among them, 92% had undetectable HIV RNA. Cirrhosis was present in 127
patients (30.3%); 6 with decompensated cirrhosis. Treatment regimens were sofosbuvir/
daclatasvir +/- ribavirin combination (61.6%) or sofosbuvir/ledipasvir +/- ribavirin

(38.4%). Five patients died, 3 due to pneumonia, and 2 due to liver failure. All deaths were
among HIV-HCV coinfected patients.
SVR was achieved by 338 patients (80.7%), whereas nine patients (2.1%) had detectable
HCV RNA 12 weeks after the end of treatment. In the remaining patients, no data on SVR was
available (Table 2). In the subgroup of phase 3 patients with data on SVR (per protocol analy￾sis), the SVR rate reached 97.4% (338/347). Combining all treatment phases, the per-protocol
SVR rate was 97.1% (507/522) and the intent-to-treat (ITT) SVR rate was 84.5% (507/600).
The ITT SVR rate during phase 3 (80.7%) was significantly lower than that during phase 2
(97%; p<0.001).
During phase 3, 49 patients (8.2%) were lost to follow-up prior to SVR time point. Among
them, 42% were mobile populations outside the capital; 71% were HCV mono-infected, 45%
had cirrhotic liver disease and 18% reported continued drug-use. These patients were targeted
by Peer Outreach Workers by word of mouth and phone calls and not located. These patients
were disproportionately from the Dharan site representing 34% of the total loss-to-follow-up
and 22% of patients at that site vs. loss to follow-up of 3–5% of patients at other sites (p = 0.036
by Chi-2 test). In phase 3, adherence to the protocol was higher for HIV co-infected individu￾als (92%) than HCV mono-infected patients (85%), (p = 0.011 by Chi-2 test). Funding for OST
and Peer Outreach personnel ran out during phase 3, correlating temporally with patient attri￾tion before SVR time point in this phase.
Phase 2 and 3 analysis
We performed univariable and multivariable analysis to explore factors associated with SVR at
12 weeks (Table 3). We found that treatment in the Kathmandu sites was associated with SVR
compared to treatment at the two sites outside of the capitol (OR 3.12 [1.20-8.13]; p=0.020).
Substance use was associated with failure to achieve SVR (0.21 [0.10-0.44]; p<0.001). There
were more patients reporting substance use during protocol during phase 3 (11%) than in
phase 2 (4%). Patients treated in phase 3 were less likely to achieve SVR than those treated dur￾ing phase 2, (0.08 [0.02-0.23]; p<0.001) a difference that remains after controlling for

status and genotype were not associated with SVR.
Discussion
This study is the first reporting a community-based HCV treatment experience and the first
description of HCV treatment among HIV co-infected individuals in Nepal. We show that
overall excellent SVR rates may be obtained in a difficult-to-treat population in a low-income
country regardless of the patient’s profile, disease severity–including decompensated cirrhosis,
and HIV status. The success of the study was made possible by pivoting care off of existing
OST sites where clients had access to peer-based support and HIV disease management tools.
We demonstrate a way forward to expand access to treatment in Nepal.
In 2015, WHO estimated that only 20% of HCV-infected individuals worldwide were diag￾nosed and only 7% had started treatment with very large country-dependent variations [9]. A
recent systematic review reporting seroprevalence of HBV, HCV, and HIV in Nepal showed
an increasing number of studies in recent years illustrating the progressive scientific develop￾ment by Nepalese researchers and institutions [10]. Remarkably, virologic diagnosis of HCV
infection linked to clinical care became available for the first time in Nepal through this proto￾col. When this study was designed in 2014, persons living with HCV infection in Nepal were
desperate. The only source of treatment was by virologic diagnosis in India and self-pay for
local IFN-treatment, which was expensive. Most patients “living with HCV in Nepal” had
never had a virologic diagnosis or any assessment of fibrosis status. They faced social discrimi￾nation and discrimination from work. Rather than waiting for DAAs to emerge in a place
where even ARV regimens continue to lag, we proceeded carefully with IFN-based regimens.
Restrictions on who could safely be treated with IFN-based therapy limited our treatment
cohort (described in S1 Appendix) just as DAAs came on the horizon out of India through col￾laborative agreements with Gilead. The stakeholders and investigators had a key opportunity
to advocate for DAA access in Nepal and were uniquely situated to immediately transition to
DAA-based treatment. We expanded the target treatment group to all comers, regardless of
fibrosis, HIV disease control and active drug and alcohol use. High cure rates were achievable
with DAAs and during a natural disaster even in presence of pejorative prognostic factors such
as advanced liver disease (including decompensated cirrhosis) and HIV-HCV co infection.
Other studies had demonstrated successful treatment of HCV with DAA in resource-limited
settings suggesting that HCV elimination is feasible in such countries [11,12]. The authors
stressed that reductions in the cost of antivirals and linkage to social and behavioral health ser￾vices including substance use disorder treatment were critical to increase retention and adher￾ence to treatment [12].
Our community-based protocol linked to OST sites was remarkably effective at minimizing
loss to follow-up with 87% of all patients completing the entire protocol (treatment and fol￾low-up testing).We explored effective aspects of our protocol to describe a Care Pathway mov￾ing forward. The majority of patients were more comfortable receiving HCV care at the OST
site than the private clinic. Nurses and a community focal person at OST sites were able to
guide care and triage to clinicians effectively after an initial clinician visit. Patient feedback
optimized the protocol in later treatment stages. We found that monthly visits and bi-monthly
support and meeting group (adapted from existing OST and HIV peer meetings), and Peer
Outreach through phone calls and home visits optimized participation and minimized patient
attrition.
We hypothesize that Kathmandu treatment was protective for several reasons. Access to the
lab was optimal in Kathmandu where viral loads were conducted as patients had regular

access. At outside sites, coordinated days for lab draw and plane transport contributed to
missed testing. This problem may be addressed by Hep C core Ag for SVR for sites without
access to virologic testing. There was a higher rate of geographic mobility for work outside of
the capitol and thus more difficulty maintaining contact. Patients perceived that confidential￾ity was more threatened in smaller communities where more care was also conducted in the
clinical setting and stated that this challenged follow-up. There was a more comprehensive net￾work of organizations working for IVDU in Kathmandu which helped in tracking patients.
Improved linkages between HCV care and existing organizations is likely a key to success for
program expansion.
During phase 3 the government of Nepal introduced a campaign mid protocol to actively
incarcerate people with pending legal cases from the distant past who were arrested and
remanded because of their previous cases related to drug use and other petty crimes. Only 1
incarcerated patient was able to remain in the study after extensive work on behalf of the inves￾tigators which highlights HCV treatment in jail as a need area in Nepal, where the rate of drug
users in prison populations is >10% and as high as 28% [13]. Substance use was higher during
phase 3 and independently associated with dropping out of the protocol.
Subsequent to initiation of this study, data has shown that genotypes 3 non-3a are associ￾ated with natural prevalence of NS5A polymorphisms. To date, genotype 3 subtype analysis
has not been done in Nepal and was not feasible in our system which we recognize as a weak￾ness. Eight of 10 patients with virologic failure and those lost to follow-up before SVR will ben￾efit from genotypic subtype and resistance testing, after Hep C core Ag testing to identify
replicating virus for the latter. Advocacy to obtain glicaprevir/pibrentasvir–not currently avail￾able in the region, may be important if genotype non-3a is described and as DAA use is more
prevalent.
Initially, we observed that waiting to optimize HIV treatment regimen and viral suppres￾sion substantially delayed HCV treatment and contributed to patient attrition. Ultimately we
promoted HCV treatment regardless of HIV regimen and control status with excellent out￾comes, as shown previously [14]. In going forward in Nepal, we advocate for HCV treatment
regardless of HIV control based on these experiences.
There were overall minimal poor outcomes considering this setting and coinfections. There
were 6 deaths; all occurred in DAA-treatment groups and among HIV coinfected patients and
predominantly among those with cirrhosis (5 of 6); 4 of 6 with concurrent drug use; 4 of 6 due
to pneumonia. This highlights a group that may require closer attention and more careful fol￾low-up. There were 3 cases of TB pneumonia during DAA therapy though there is no known
association. This is an area for research.
Overall completion and retention in care is more remarkable considering unique challenges
in Nepal during this protocol. Nepal faced the severe Gorkha earthquake on April 25, 2015
with subsequent quakes and aftermath during this protocol. We estimate that this earthquake
directly affected at least 20% of our enrolled population and 100% of patients were socially
affected. All patients were enrolled at that time with none from phase 2 and 3 having initiated
treatment. All collected samples were retained in appropriate conditions with emergency
power supplies despite the substantial breakdown in the electrical grid in the Kathmandu and
elsewhere in the weeks immediately following the earthquake. Some patients who had not yet
initiated treatment or not yet obtained SVR data were lost to follow-up due to migration after
the event. Due to delays, largely related to logistics surrounding the earthquake, the timeframe
of our protocol was shifted. Phase 2 treatment was so delayed that phase 3 encompassed a
3-times larger cohort (413 vs. 135). In addition this resulted in final SVR data collection
extending beyond the funding mechanism. The volume and delays likely contributed to the
high attrition before data collection during phase 3.

One of the main barriers to DAA-based treatment access in resource-limited countries is
their elevated cost. Moreover, even though DAAs have become available at highly subsidized
cost (approximately 800–1000 USD, near the average annual income in Nepal), DAAs remain
cost prohibitive for most Nepalese [7]. In this context, the arrival of low-cost generic drugs will
be most effective in the presence of HCV treatment as a national agenda and with government
or nongovernmental funding [15]. Government supported treatment has been discussed for a
finite HIV-HCV co-infected cohort in Nepal but there are no concrete plans for the HCV
mono-infected population, or for risk groups such as diabetics, prisoners and cirrhotics at this
time.
Based on our experience, a Care Pathway for HCV care expansion in settings like ours may
consider: OST-based care with a designated community focal (non-medical) leader and inter￾mediate level provider with doctor oversight, broad serologic testing for HCV with reflex Hep
C core Ag and APRI, Hepatitis B Ag and HIV testing, monthly visits (clinical with substance
use and depression screening). Funded bimonthly support group and peer counseling by paid
staff throughout care and until SVR with more intensive peer support for active substance
users should be prioritized. Hep C core Ag testing at 12 weeks after completion for SVR rather
than virologic testing would optimize outcomes analysis at rural sites. The reliability and dura￾bility of earlier SVR is an important area for research. Clinical care will be simplified with pan￾genotypic drug.
The 2016 WHO objective of “eradicating” HCV by the year 2030 was later determined to be
a too ambitious target and objectives were revised. Some of the new objectives include the
detection of 90% of patients chronically infected with HCV and treatment of 80% of patients
chronically infected [3,16]. These screening and treatment rates still seem unrealistic, espe￾cially for resource-limited countries [17]. A substantial treatment scale up is needed especially
in IVDU to control the HCV epidemic [18]. Scale up based on decentralization of HCV treat￾ment with DAAs prescribed by non-specialized personnel at primary care settings was shown
to be effective in terms of SVR12 [19]. Our network linking OST clinics in distant parts of the
country to higher level testing and care in the capital is a model for further initiatives to treat
individuals living with HCV in Nepal and may be applied elsewhere to help achieve these
goals.
