Abstract
BACKGROUND--Several studies have suggested that the respiratory
muscles are weak in patients with heart failure, but the aetiology


and clinical relevance of this weakness are unclear. In order to see
if respiratory muscle weakness in this context is part of a more
generalised myopathic process, respiratory and limb muscle
strength were compared in patients with heart failure. The relation
between respiratory muscle strength, breathlessness on exercise,
and exercise capacity was also examined. METHODS--Twenty
patients (three women) with New York Heart Association (NYHA)
class II-IV heart failure of mean age 63 years were studied.
Respiratory muscle strength was assessed using maximum
inspiratory and expiratory mouth pressures (MIP and MEP) and
transdiaphragmatic pressure during sniffs (sniff PDI). These
parameters were compared with cardiac output (indirect Fick) and
with limb muscle strength as assessed by grip strength. The patients
also performed two exercise tests during which they rated their
breathlessness on a Borg scale. RESULTS--Mean (SD) cardiac index
was 2.2 (0.4) l/min/m2. MIP and MEP were 66 (27) and 99 (29) cm
H2O respectively. Sniff PDI was 103 (21) cm H2O and was
positively correlated with grip strength and cardiac output
(Spearman rank correlation coefficients 0.527 and 0.451,
respectively). None of the indices of respiratory muscle strength
were related to exercise time or breathlessness during exercise.
CONCLUSIONS--The respiratory muscles are weak in patients with
heart failure. This weakness reflects a more generalised myopathic
process, possibly related to reduced cardiac output. However,
respiratory muscle weakness does not appear to be an important
factor in the aetiology of breathlessness on exercise.
