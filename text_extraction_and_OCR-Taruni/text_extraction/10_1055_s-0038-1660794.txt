Portal hypertension, or elevated portal pressure due to
resistance to portal flow, is defined as an absolute portal
venous pressure of >10 mm Hg or a pressure gradient
between portal and systemic veins of >5 mm Hg.1–3 Portal
hypertension can be classified into three main categories
based on the anatomic location (►Table 1).3–5
Extrahepatic (prehepatic) portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is
the most common cause of portal hypertension in the
pediatric population, accounting for 70% of cases,6 and it
is the most common cause of an upper gastrointestinal (GI)
bleed in this population. In extrahepatic PVT, normal hepa￾topetal flow from the superior mesenteric vein and splenic

Abstract Interventional radiology’s role in the management of portal hypertension in the
pediatric population differs from the management of adult portal hypertension. In
the pediatric population, portal hypertension is frequently secondary to thrombosis
and cavernous transformation of the extrahepatic portion of the portal vein. Transju￾gular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt can be utilized to manage portal hypertension
in children with intrinsic liver disease that results in cirrhosis and portal hypertension,
and is often used as a bridge to transplant. While technically feasible in extrahepatic
portal vein occlusion, the sequelae of portosystemic shunting are less desirable in a
child. The Meso-Rex bypass procedure, which represents the mainstay of management
for pediatric portal hypertension, provides surgical relief of extrahepatic portal vein
obstruction and restores mesenteric venous blood flow to the liver. This article aims to
review management of portal hypertension in children as it pertains to the interven￾tional radiologist, including preoperative assessment, postoperative evaluation, and
the management of complications of the Meso-Rex bypass.

vein is impeded by obstruction of the main portal vein.7,8
This can result in cavernous transformation of the portal
vein9,10 within 6 to 20 days of acute portal vein thrombus.
Development of cavernous transformation can be associated
with severe portal hypertension, biliary disease, liver dys￾function, and coagulopathy. Patients may present with
ascites, splenomegaly, or encephalopathy.
Although this sequence of events can occasionally be sec￾ondary to iatrogenic injury related to neonatal catheterization
of the umbilical vein, and even more infrequently secondary to
tumor or infection, no cause is found in up to 50% of cases
(idiopathic prehepatic portal hypertension) (►Table 2).11–13
Unlike in adults, coagulopathies are not a frequent cause of
PVT in children.13,14
Initial treatment for pediatric portal hypertension focuses
on preventing and controlling variceal formation and upper
GI bleeding by utilizing medical therapy (e.g., nonselective
β-blockers), sclerotherapy, and band ligation of varices.
A hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG)10 mm Hg is
predictive of the formation of varices and decompensation
of cirrhosis in adults, but its role is less well defined in the
pediatric population.15
Surgical treatment is typically reserved for those patients
who have failed medical and endoscopic measures, or who
have significant sequela of portal venous hypertension, includ￾ing significant splenomegaly. Historically, surgical techniques
included splenectomy along with the creation of a portosys￾temic shunt. The Meso-Rex bypass procedure, first described
in 1992, provided a physiological and anatomic bypass that
could correct portal hypertension in the setting of portal vein
occlusion. Most commonly, the Meso-Rex bypass or “Rex
shunt” consists of a conduit, typically autologous right internal
jugular vein, connecting the intrahepatic left portal vein (LPV)
to the infrapancreatic superior mesenteric vein. This conduit
reestablishes first-pass portal perfusion. It is important for the
interventional radiologist to be familiar with the preoperative
assessment and postoperative management of these shunts.
Finally, in the small percentage of patients with chronic
liver disease or failed shunt surgery, transjugular intrahepa￾tic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is a treatment consideration,
which is often used as a bridge to transplant.
Role of HVPG Measurement
While published data on HVPG measurement in children are
limited, there may be similar pressure thresholds for the
development of complications in the pediatric population.15
HVPG measurements are feasible in pediatric patients, but
there remains no general recommendation regarding the use
of these measurements in clinical practice.15 In children with
chronic liver disease who require a transjugular liver biopsy,
HVPG can be performed simultaneously to provide important
supportive diagnostic and prognostic information about the
underlying liver process.
Shunt Surgery
There are multiple types of surgical shunt procedures,
including mesocaval, coronariocaval, inferior mesenteric
vein/left renal vein, proximal splenorenal, distal splenorenal
(“Warren shunt”), and mesenterico-LPV (Rex) shunt proce￾dures. While portosystemic shunts can provide relief of
extrahepatic portal vein obstruction, systemic shunting
and its known sequelae are less desirable in children. In
contrast, the mesenterico-portal Rex shunt bypasses the
extrahepatic portal obstruction but maintains physiological
intrahepatic portal vein perfusion, thereby avoiding the
effects of systemic shunting. For the Rex shunt, the LPV is
surgically exposed at the Rex recess and a conduit (typically
autologous internal jugular vein) is anastomosed at that site.
Next, this conduit is taken over the pancreas, posterior to the
stomach, through the mesocolon, and then anastomosed to
the infrapancreatic SMV (►Fig. 1a, b).
Preoperative Evaluation
Ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic reso￾nance imaging (MRI) are all frequently employed as part of the
preoperative evaluation. The main objectives of preoperative

imaging prior toMeso-Rex bypass is to confirm the presence of
extrahepatic portal vein occlusion, evaluate the extent of
cavernous transformation (►Fig. 2a, b), evaluate the patency
and size of the intrahepatic portal venous system and superior
mesenteric vein, evaluate for large collaterals that may alter￾natively be used for a bypass, and assess for additional vascular
and solid organ abnormalities. While CT angiography (CTA)
and MR angiography (MRA) are highly sensitive and accurate
in predicting patency of the superior mesenteric vein, cross￾sectional imaging does not adequately delineate the intrahe￾patic portal venous anatomy. Often the intrahepatic portal
venous system is diminutive, which is why cross-sectional
imaging is limited; however, it is well delineated with wedged
hepatic venous portography, which is highly sensitive and
accurate in predicting patency of the LPV.16 This is performed
via a transjugular approach (►Fig. 3). At our center, the right
internal jugular vein is punctured under ultrasound guidance
using a 21-G needle standard micropuncture set system. A 9F
vascular sheath is placed, which allows us to perform transju￾gular liver biopsies to exclude underlying liver disease. Sub￾sequently, the hepatic veins are catheterized with a 5F catheter
and wedged venograms are performed. Generally, the left

hepatic vein and the middle hepatic vein wedge venograms
allow the best opacification of the portal vein at the Rex recess.
Direct percutaneous portography is less frequently used as the
portal branches are often diminutive and access can be chal￾lenging. Furthermore, direct access to the left portal venous
system risks injuring the possible anastomosis site. Alternative
shunts may be employed at the time of surgery if there is
inadequate anatomy for a Meso-Rex bypass (e.g., no useable
portal vein at time of surgical exploration of the Rex
recessus).17
Evaluation of Postoperative Complications
Color and Doppler ultrasound is most frequently employed
to assess shunt patency at follow-up. Some centers also
perform CTA or MRA at specific time intervals. Immediate
complications of Meso-Rex shunt frequently include the
presence of fluid collections (seroma, hematoma, abscess).
Patients with graft stenosis or occlusion may present with
the sequelae of recurrent portal hypertension, including GI
bleed, ascites, splenomegaly, and thrombocytopenia. Graft
stenosis often occurs at the portal anastomosis and can be
confirmed with elevated velocities and aliasing on ultra￾sound or narrowing noted on CTA/MRA.
Meso-Rex Complications and Interventions
Interventional radiology is often the first line of treatment for
graft-related stenosis or occlusion via angioplasty/stenting or
thrombectomy, respectively. The approach utilized at our
center is a percutaneous transhepatic access under ultra￾sound-guided access into the portal vein. Utilizing a 5F marker
tip sheath, the stenosis is often easily traversed with a glide￾wire/glide catheter and the stenosisis delineated and pressures
across the narrowing are obtained (►Fig. 4a). Balloon angio￾plasty is employed at sites of stenosis (►Fig. 4b, c), and repeat
pressure gradients across the narrowing are obtained to con￾firm normalization of the gradient. Generally, stents are not
utilized in children, as sizing can be problematic in a growing
child; however, in the setting of recalcitrant stenosis not

responsive to angioplasty or a graft requiring multiple inter￾ventions, stents may be utilized.
There have been several successful cases of shunt throm￾bolysis at our center utilizing thrombolytic therapy (such as
tissue plasminogen activator) and mechanical/suction
thrombectomy. Once the intervention is performed, the
catheter is removed, and the tract is embolized. At our center,
we opt to use Gelfoam plugs to mitigate the presence of
streak artifact on future cross-sectional imaging.
TIPS as an Intervention
While technically feasible, TIPS is rarely indicated in extra￾hepatic portal vein occlusion given the proven efficacy of
Meso-Rex shunts. In addition, the Rex shunt is preferred as it
avoids the sequelae of portosystemic shunting. For children
with primary liver disease that results in cirrhosis and end￾stage liver failure, liver transplantation is the primary
therapy in children. While TIPS are frequently considered
as a bridge to transplant in adults with cirrhosis, this practice
is much less common in the pediatric population.15 If trans￾plantation or surgical portosystemic shunting is not feasible,
a TIPS may be considered to palliate variceal bleeding that
persists despite combined pharmacological and endoscopic
therapy.
Other Interventions
Additional treatments may be indicated depending on the
etiology of portal hypertension in the pediatric patient. For
instance, there may be a role for angioplasty and stenting in
the setting of Budd–Chiari. In patients with arterioportal
fistulas and associated portal hypertension, embolization
can be easily performed. Posttransplant portal anastomotic
strictures or thrombosis can be managed utilizing similar
techniques to the adult population.
Conclusion
The management of portal hypertension in children differs
from the management of adult portal hypertension. Extra￾hepatic (prehepatic) PVT is the most common cause of portal
hypertension in the pediatric population, with the surgical
Meso-Rex bypass providing definitive management by rees￾tablishing first-pass portal perfusion. It is important that the
interventional radiologist be familiar with the Meso-Rex
procedure, including preoperative evaluation and post￾operative management. TIPS is not typically indicated for
the management of pediatric extrahepatic PVT but can be
utilized in the management of portal hypertension in chil￾dren with inherent liver disease that results in cirrhosis and
portal hypertension. The interventional radiologist should
be familiar with the limited scenarios when TIPS is the
appropriate course of treatment in the pediatric patient
with portal hypertension.
