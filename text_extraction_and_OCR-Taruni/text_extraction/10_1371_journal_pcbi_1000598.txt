Abstract
The parts of the genome transcribed by a cell or tissue reflect the biological processes and functions it carries out. We
characterized the features of mammalian tissue transcriptomes at the gene level through analysis of RNA deep sequencing
(RNA-Seq) data across human and mouse tissues and cell lines. We observed that roughly 8,000 protein-coding genes were
ubiquitously expressed, contributing to around 75% of all mRNAs by message copy number in most tissues. These mRNAs
encoded proteins that were often intracellular, and tended to be involved in metabolism, transcription, RNA processing or
translation. In contrast, genes for secreted or plasma membrane proteins were generally expressed in only a subset of
tissues. The distribution of expression levels was broad but fairly continuous: no support was found for the concept of
distinct expression classes of genes. Expression estimates that included reads mapping to coding exons only correlated
better with qRT-PCR data than estimates which also included 39 untranslated regions (UTRs). Muscle and liver had the least
complex transcriptomes, in that they expressed predominantly ubiquitous genes and a large fraction of the transcripts came
from a few highly expressed genes, whereas brain, kidney and testis expressed more complex transcriptomes with the vast
majority of genes expressed and relatively small contributions from the most expressed genes. mRNAs expressed in brain
had unusually long 39UTRs, and mean 39UTR length was higher for genes involved in development, morphogenesis and
signal transduction, suggesting added complexity of UTR-based regulation for these genes. Our results support a model in
which variable exterior components feed into a large, densely connected core composed of ubiquitously expressed
intracellular proteins.

Introduction
A fundamental question in molecular biology is how cells and
tissues differ in gene expression and how those differences specify
biological function. A related question is what part of the cellular
machinery represents housekeeping functions needed by all cells
and how many genes encode such functions. The transcriptomes
of mammalian tissues have been extensively studied using methods
such as reassociation kinetics (Rot) [1], serial analysis of gene
expression (SAGE) [2], microarrays [3,4], and sequencing of
expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and full length transcripts [5].
Reassociation kinetics was used early on to study and compare
global properties of tissue transcriptomes [1,6]. From those studies
it was concluded that ,20,000 mRNAs are expressed in each cell
or tissue, and that roughly 90% of all mRNAs are common
between two tissues, drawing the first conclusions on tissue
transcriptome compositions [7]. Later studies of tissue transcrip￾tomes using SAGE [8] identified ,1,000 ubiquitously expressed
genes (i.e. expressed in all cell types examined) and concluded that
tissue-specific transcripts make up roughly 1% of mRNA mass of
cells. Focusing on colorectal cancer cell lines, for which the deepest
coverage was available, it was estimated that half of all mRNA
transcripts in these cells came from the 623 most highly expressed
genes. Comparing mRNA expression levels across panels of
human and mouse tissues by microarrays, Su and coworkers
identified tissue-specific genes for each tissue, and estimated that
,6% of genes were ubiquitously expressed, and that individual
tissues express 30–40% of all genes [9]. Using additional
microarray data, expression of ,8,000 genes was detected in
each tissue but as few as 1–3% of these were detected in all tissues
[10]. Similar conclusions were drawn from a second mouse tissue
atlas [11] that identified ,1,800 genes as ubiquitously expressed.
Altogether, microarrays and SAGE have been quite successful in
identifying tissue and cell specific genes [8–12]. However, the
discrepancy between estimates of the composition and character￾istics of tissue transcriptomes obtained by microarray and SAGE
methods on the one hand and reassociation kinetics studies on the
other has not been explained.
Deep sequencing of RNAs (RNA-Seq) has recently been used to
quantify gene and alternative isoform expression levels [13–17]. In
RNA-Seq, all RNAs of a sample (or, more often, polyA+ RNAs)
are randomly fragmented, reverse transcribed, ligated to adapters
and then these fragments are sequenced. Gene expression levels
can then be estimated from the number of sequence reads deriving
from each gene [15]. Expression estimates from RNA-Seq are
quantitative over five orders of magnitude and replicates of mouse

tissues are highly reproducible [13]. Compared to microarrays,
RNA-Seq is more sensitive, both in terms of detection of lowly
expressed and differentially expressed genes [15,18], and expres￾sion values from RNA-Seq correlate better with protein levels
[19]. The greater accuracy and coverage of the expressed
transcriptome makes this method suitable for addressing global
features of transcriptomes.
We recently studied alternative isoform expressions across
tissues using RNA-Seq and found both a very high frequency of
alternative splicing and extensive tissue regulation of the
expression of alternative mRNA isoforms [14]. Here we instead
focused on a gene-centric analysis of transcript composition and
complexity. The highly quantitative nature of RNA-Seq has
motivated us to revisit the longstanding questions regarding the
composition of tissue transcriptomes, as well as the expression of
long non-coding RNAs, the variability in 39UTR length, and the
association between these features and gene function.
Results
Excluding 39 UTR reads yields more accurate gene
expression estimates
We investigated the transcriptomes of a diverse collection of
human and mouse tissues and five breast and breast cancer cell
lines that were recently sequenced at a depth of roughly 20 million
short reads per sample using RNA-Seq protocols (Table S1). Gene
expression was initially estimated by calculating read density as
‘reads per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads’
(RPKM) [13]. These estimates are typically performed using
common gene annotations (e.g., RefSeq) with the entire annotated
transcript representing the ‘exon model’. These expression level
estimates may however be confounded by the expression of shorter
isoforms due to alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (Figure
S1A and S1B). We found that excluding annotated 39UTRs –
which will sometimes vary between mRNA isoforms as a result of
alternative cleavage and polyadenylation – enabled estimation of
expression levels that correspond more closely with quantitative
RT-PCR measurements (Figure S1C). We noted that removing
the 39UTR from calculation of gene expression yields a .2-fold
change for over one thousand genes (Figure S1D), and that the
effect of 39UTRs on expression estimates does not seem to be a
technical issue caused by secondary structure in the 39UTR
(Figure S2). We therefore advocate excluding UTRs from such
estimates, and all subsequent gene expression estimates described
here excluded 39UTR regions.
Ubiquitous expression of ,8,000 human genes
We next sought to answer how many genes are expressed in a
tissue or cell type. A comparison between the expression levels of
exons and intergenic regions was used to first find a threshold for
detectable expression above background (Figure 1A, algorithm in
Figure S3), yielding a threshold RPKM value of 0.3 which balances
the numbers of false positives and false negatives. For individual
samples, we obtained threshold values between 0.2 and 0.8. As it is
difficult to identify untranscribed DNA regions with confidence
[20,21], it is very possible that the background was overestimated.
Applying the threshold 0.3 RPKM, the number of genes expressed
in most human and mouse tissues varied from 11,000 to 13,000,
corresponding to roughly 60–70% of RefSeq protein-coding genes
(Table 1). These gene number estimates were stable across different
sequencing depths (Figure 1B) and therefore represent bona fide
tissue differences. Testis was a clear outlier, expressing more than
15,000 different genes (84% of RefSeq genes). As many as 7,897
genes (42%) were observed to be expressed in all tissues and cell lines
(Dataset S1). The corresponding number for Ensembl annotation
was 8,214, or 38% of protein-coding genes (Ensembl is an
automated gene annotation system, whereas RefSeq is manually
curated). Each ubiquitous gene was typically expressed at roughly
the same order of magnitude in all tissues, suggesting that there were
few problems with genes being considered ubiquitous when they
were really specific to one or a few tissues but had a leaky, non￾functional expression elsewhere (Figure S4). While we observed
small numbers of reads for 8 genes known to have leaky
transcription [22,23] in several tissues, these genes were all too
weakly or narrowly transcribed outside their main tissue to be
detected as ubiquitous. The estimated number of ubiquitously
expressed genes appeared to plateau as the number of samples used
was increased to the full set of 24 (Figure 1C). The detection
threshold used affects the number of genes detected (Table 1), and
the number of detected ubiquitous genes can vary by up to ,2,000
genes depending on threshold used. The number of samples is large
enough that background is unlikely to cause relatively tissue-specific
genes to be detected in every sample. These differences between
thresholds therefore most likely reflect the presence of low￾abundance RNA species. The number of ubiquitous genes we
detected is much greater than the ,1,000 shared genes identified by
SAGE [8] and the 1–6% of genes from microarrays [9–11], but is in
relatively good agreement with the ,10,000 shared genes estimated
by reassociation kinetics [6] and the 3,140 to 6,909 estimated from
ESTs [24] (the higher number came from a cutoff of presence in 16
out of 18 tissues, used to remedy uneven EST sequencing across
tissues). The increased number of ubiquitously expressed genes
compared to SAGE and microarrays most likely results from the
increased depth of mRNA-Seq data and improved detection of
lowly expressed genes [22]. The number of genes expressed in a
tissue ranged from 11,199 to 15,518 genes (Table 2), so a majority of
the genes expressed in a specific tissue or cell type are ubiquitously
expressed genes. These genes contribute ,75% of the polyA+ RNA
molecules in most tissues (Table 3), although this fraction was higher
in the cancer cell lines, perhaps as a result of their elevated
metabolic rate.
Functions of ubiquitous and non-ubiquitous genes
To characterize the set of ubiquitously expressed genes we had
identified, we looked for functional enrichment compared to genes
expressed only in a subset of the tissues analyzed (hereafter called
non-ubiquitous). The protein products of human ubiquitously
Author Summary
A variety of genes are active within the nuclei of our cells.
Some are needed for the day-to-day maintenance of cell
functions, while others have roles that are more specific to
certain tissues or particular cell types; for example, only the
pancreas produces insulin. As a result, every tissue has its
own profile of gene activity. Since active genes produce
RNA, tissue differences in gene activity can be probed by
characterizing the RNA they contain. Essentially the entire
set of RNAs or ‘transcriptome’ has been sequenced from
various tissues, and we used these data to compare the
degree of specialization of different tissues and to
investigate the set of ‘core’ genes active in every tissue.
A central observation was that there are an abundance of
such core genes, and that these genes account for the
majority of the transcriptome in each tissue. These findings
will aid in the understanding of what makes tissues, and
cell types, different from each other and what each
requires to function.

expressed genes were more likely to have intracellular localization
and to be involved in metabolism and other core cellular functions
such as macromolecule synthesis, general transcription and vesicles
(Figure 1E). Genes that were expressed in only one or a few tissues
were more often secreted or membrane-bound (Figure 1E; Dataset
S2 and S3), suggesting that cellular contacts and communication are
mediated more often by specialized tissue-specific components.
Interestingly, an exception to this inside-outside rule was sequence￾specific DNA binding proteins, which are nuclear yet seldom
ubiquitously expressed. Among these transcription factors we found
that POU, homeobox and forkhead genes had the fewest
ubiquitously expressed members, consistent with roles in specifying
cell and tissue identity [25], whereas e.g. basic-leucine zipper factors
were more often ubiquitous (Table 4). Functional characterization
of housekeeping genes has been done in the past [26,27] (and
indirectly by [28]), with comparable results, although transporters
were found to be relatively tissue-specific in one study [26]. Rather
than looking at ubiquitous expression, that study compared the
mean number of tissues where the genes were expressed, which
could explain the difference. Ubiquitous genes often had CpG
islands near their promoters (Figure 1D), as has been observed
previously for ubiquitous and developmental genes [29]. The set of
ubiquitous genes with CpG-poor promoters were not enriched for
any GO category compared to all ubiquitous genes, nor were those
with CpG-rich promoters. These observations suggest that
ubiquitous expression is a better indicator of housekeeping functions
than promoter CpG content. Together, these analyses suggest that
much of the internal cytoplasmic machinery and most nuclear
functions are common to most or all tissues, and that a large portion
of the differences between tissues lie primarily in expression of
receptors and ligands that mediate communication, and in a subset
of sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factors.
Estimating the fraction of the transcriptome devoted to
specific functions
As RNA-Seq expression measurements are highly quantitative,
we also explored tissue transcriptome composition in terms of

mRNA abundance classes [1] and the extent to which mRNA
populations are dominated by a few highly expressed genes. Genes
were sorted according to their expression and the fraction of the
total cellular polyA+ RNA pool devoted to the most highly
expressed genes was determined. This analysis showed that
mRNA expression in both tissues (Figure 2A) and cell lines
(Figure 2B) followed a continuous distribution rather than
separating into distinct abundance classes as reported in previous
studies (e.g. [1,6]).
In muscle and liver transcriptomes, a small number of genes
contributed a large fraction of the total mRNA pool, e.g. the ten
most highly expressed genes in liver and muscle made up roughly
20–40% of the mRNA population. Other tissue transcriptomes
were more complex, with the ten most highly expressed genes
contributing only 5–10% of the mRNAs in brain, kidney and
testis. The remaining tissues had intermediate levels of complexity
(Figure 2A). The breast cancer cell lines had similar or greater
complexity than normal breast tissue (Figure 2B). Biological
replicates in both human and mouse tended to have highly similar
complexity distributions (Figure 2C, 2D). Mouse tissues had
somewhat similar profiles to corresponding human tissues
(Figure 2D), although a much higher expression of several acute￾phase genes in both human liver samples shifted their curves
toward lower complexity compared to mouse liver. We conclude
that kidney, testes and brain tissues have more complex
transcriptomes due to the expression of more genes and with less
dominance of a few highly expressed genes, whereas liver and
muscle tissues are the least complex and express fewer genes, with
more dramatic contributions of highly expressed genes.
We next asked what fractions of total cellular mRNA are
allocated to genes involved in different biological processes across
the different tissues and cell lines. For this purpose, we developed a
tool called FRACT (Functional Relative Allocation of Transcripts)
that assesses relative gene expression from RNA-Seq read density
for arbitrary sets of genes or broad gene ontology (GO) categories
(results for a subset of tissues are shown in Figure 3A). This analysis
provided a perspective on the functional priorities of cells in each
tissue, since allocating a large fraction of the polyA+ RNA content
in a cell (and likely of translational capacity) to one functional
category represents a major investment of cellular resources. For
some categories, including ‘metabolic process’, ‘transport’, and
also ‘regulation of cell proliferation’, FRACT allocation varied
relatively little across the tissues and cell lines (as measured by the
coefficient of variation, CV, of the transcriptome fraction),
consistent with the expected ‘housekeeping’ functions of these
gene categories. Other categories had a far higher fraction of
transcripts allocated to them in one tissue than in others, e.g.
immune response (high in lymph node), muscle contraction, heart
development and electron transport (all high in heart), and signal
transduction and G protein-coupled receptor signaling (both high
in brain). These examples, representing more specialized activities
expected to be of increased importance in the corresponding
tissues, provided a molecular-level validation of the integrity of the
tissue samples and protocol used. In some cases, differences not
readily apparent from the broad GO categorization shown in
Figure 3A, could be detected by finer sub-classification of
categories – an example is shown in Figure 3B.
We also investigated the expression of thousands of large non￾coding RNAs (ncRNAs). These genes were found to contribute a
small fraction of transcripts to polyA+ transcriptomes compared to
mRNAs (Figure 4A) as a result of their considerably lower
expression levels (Figure 4B). These levels are lower than for
mRNAs for all degrees of tissue-specificity (Figure 4C).
Tissue-specific gene expression is fairly well conserved
Muscle and brain tissues from human and mouse were observed
to have similar expression and FRACT distributions (Figure 2D
and data not shown), raising the question of the extent of
conservation of tissue-specific expression patterns. We compared
global gene expression levels between human and mouse tissues
and observed high correlations between expression of orthologous
genes between human and mouse (Pearson correlation 0.76 for
muscle, 0.77 for liver and brain). When different tissues were
compared (e.g. human brain vs. mouse muscle) substantially
weaker correlations were observed (Pearson correlations in the
range 0.47 to 0.61). These observations indicate a fairly strong
overall conservation of gene expression levels between mouse and
man, consistent with previous studies based on microarrays [30].
39 UTR length varies 3-fold between different functional
groups of genes
The lengths of mRNAs were studied by mapping the reads to
coding and untranslated regions. Using RefSeq annotations, the
density of reads in untranslated regions was lower than in coding
regions (Figure 5A), suggesting that expression of mRNAs with
UTRs shorter than or distinct from those annotated in RefSeq is
common. We therefore estimated the lengths of the UTRs as their
relative number of reads to coding regions using the annotated
coding region length. Mouse data from [13] was chosen for this
analysis as this dataset had little 39 bias (Figure S5). In all three
mouse tissues studied, significant negative correlations were
observed between expression level and transcript length (20.31
in liver and muscle, 20.16 in brain; all tissues p,10287), showing
that shorter mRNAs tend to be expressed at higher levels
(Figure 5B). This result agrees with that from reassociation kinetics
data [31]. Weighting each gene by the expression level to obtain
length estimates for the bulk mRNA population in tissues to obtain
the average mRNA length in each tissue, we found that brain
mRNAs have longer 39UTRs on average than liver and muscle
mRNAs, by 300–400 nucleotides (Figure 5C).
To assess the protein functions encoded by transcripts with long
or short UTRs, we calculated the median length of 59 and 39UTRs
of genes associated with each GO biological process category

(Figure 6B and data not shown). Transcripts coding for proteins
involved in metabolism and RNA processing had the shortest
UTRs (medians below 500 bp), while the longest median UTR
lengths were observed in transcripts encoding proteins involved in
development, morphogenesis and signal transduction (Figure 6A).
The median lengths in the longest categories ranged between 1000
and 1500 nt, i.e. two- to three-fold longer than for typical
metabolism- or RNA processing-associated transcripts. Some of
these differences might reflect an increased role for 39UTR
sequences in localization of proteins to specific membrane
locations, likely to be more common for proteins involved in
signal transduction and morphogenesis than for metabolic or RNA
processing-associated proteins, which are typically cytoplasmic or
nuclear, respectively. These differences could also reflect differ￾ences in the complexity of translational regulation among these
classes of genes.
Discussion
A surprise in our analysis was the large number of ubiquitous
genes found expressed in all tissues and cell lines, and that these
genes account for a majority of the mRNA pool. This pattern
suggests that tissue identity derives less from expression of distinct
sets of genes in different tissues than was previously thought.
Ubiquitous genes can still vary in relative expression levels
between tissues however, and in expression of alternative mRNA

isoforms [14]. Although a still limited set of tissue and cell lines was
available for this meta-analysis (24 in total), the observation
appears robust to inclusion of additional tissues (Figure 1C). Many
genes had a low and rather constant expression across tissues. This
could mean our expression detection was affected by subpopula￾tions of cells, limiting the extent our conclusions can be
extrapolated to single cells, but it could also indicate the existence
of a large population of lowly but universally expressed genes. One
subpopulation that could potentially impact these estimates would
be organism-wide cell types. For example, blood-related cells may
be found in all vascularized tissues and genes specific to these cells
may be detected as ubiquitous. Our study limited this effect by
requiring ubiquitous genes to also be detected in cell lines. Future
analyses of pure cell populations could definitely assess the
contributions of common cell types. When single-cell transcrip￾tomes (like [32]) are available for multiple cell types, it will be
possible to identify the core set of genes expressed in every
mammalian cell. Still, our analyses of tissue transcriptomes points
to a higher number of core genes even in individual cells than
previously inferred.
Transcriptome complexity varied substantially across tissues,
with brain, kidney and testis having higher complexity in that they
expressed more genes and had more diverse mRNA populations.
This increased transcriptome complexity may stem from the
presence of more heterogeneous cell types in brain and testis or
from a need for more diverse protein repertoires. The lower

complexity observed in liver, muscle and heart presumably reflects
more specialized functions of these tissues. Our FRACT analysis
estimated the fraction of mRNA populations devoted to biological
processes that are more specific for muscle and liver cells, such as
muscle contraction, metabolism, electron transport and acute￾phase response. At this point we have only static pictures of the
functional allocation of mRNA resources across tissues and cell
lines. Following the dynamic regulation of mRNA allocations
during developmental or disease progression would therefore be of
great interest, and might lead to robust gene expression signatures
that are diagnostic of cellular state.
Many studies (e.g. [33,34]) cite the existence of three distinct
abundance classes of mRNAs, originally observed by reassociation
kinetics [1,6] (reviewed in [7]). Although we detected mRNA
expression levels that varied across several orders of magnitude, we
observed no separation of mRNAs into distinct expression level
classes, instead finding a continuum of expression levels. Similarly,
no separation into distinct expression classes was observed in
SAGE data (Figure 4 in [35]), although the authors discussed the
larger impact of sequencing errors. This discrepancy with
reassociation kinetics analyses may result from the limited number
of data points used in these earlier studies, in conjunction with line
fitting algorithms that could artificially add inflection points [1,36].
Previous studies using ESTs and microarrays have found a bias
towards the usage of longer 39UTRs in brain tissues [14,37] and
found that 39UTR length can be dynamically regulated in
response to activating and mitogenic signals [38]. The short read
sequencing data allowed us to estimate the average lengths of
transcripts in different tissues and we found that brain expressed
mRNAs with 39UTRs 300–400 bp longer on average than in
other tissues. An important factor seems to be the brain-specific
expression of genes with long 39UTRs (data not shown). Perhaps
this is required in a tissue where many mRNAs are transported far
away from the nuclei, or the variety among neurons requires a
large regulatory capacity housed in the UTRs. Interestingly,
transcripts coding for specific protein functions seem to require
longer 39UTRs and 59UTRs, including proteins involved in axon
guidance which have on average almost three times the UTR
length of ribosome biogenesis genes [39], suggesting extensive
UTR-based regulation, e.g. of translation and/or mRNA
localization, in this class of genes [40,41].
It was striking how many protein-coding genes were expressed
in all samples studied, even including many transcription factors.
This pattern could help in identifying determinants of cell identity
and responses, as ubiquitous genes are less interesting candidates
and could be discarded or separated when clustering samples by
gene expression. It could also make it easier to select candidate
disease genes after genetic linkage or association studies as
ubiquitous genes are less involved in hereditary diseases [42].
Furthermore, it accentuates the importance of cell communication
as a regulatory mechanism, as these components are mostly
restricted to particular tissues and cell types and play a role in
‘calculating’ what state a cell should have [43], information that is
then transmitted through a relatively static interior of the cell.
These components have relatively recent origins as a result of their
importance in multicellular organisms [28,44], and sit on the
periphery of the protein interaction network, conveying informa￾tion directly to and from the center consisting of highly connected
and generally ubiquitously expressed genes [45–47].
Methods
Short-read RNA sequence data
We used short read data from human tissues from [14]
(SRA002355.1) and [18], mouse tissues from [13] (downloaded
from http://woldlab.caltech.edu/html/rnaseq), mouse embryonic
cell and body data from [16] (http://grimmond.imb.uq.edu.au/
mESEB.html) and cerebellum data from non-schizophrenic
humans from [48]. See respective papers for details on library
preparation, sequencing and general read mapping statistics. The
data from [18] were mapped to build hg18 with bowtie [49] with
setting –best and ambiguous reads were removed. Two human
brain samples were used. The sample with lower sequencing depth
from a mix of individuals was used in the comparison with RT￾PCR data, while the deeper sample was used everywhere else.
Gene expression estimates
We mapped read positions onto gene models and estimated
gene densities as the number of reads divided by the number of
read start positions. We used only reads that mapped uniquely to
the genome, and only positions where a read could potentially
map uniquely counted toward exon length. For testing different
ways of measuring gene expression (by removing different parts of
the gene structure), we selected a set of genes with .2 exons and
only one annotated isoform in RefSeq whose expressions had been
measured by the MicroArray Quality Control project [50] in the
same two samples, UHR (universal human reference) RNA and

brain. Cleavage and polyadenylation sites are from [51,52].
RefSeq or Ensembl gene annotations without 39UTRs were then
used for all gene expression estimates. For genes with multiple
splice variants, we fitted an RPKM value to each variant by least
square regression and used the sum of the expression of all
isoforms (Figure S6). Isoforms that did not overlap directly but
were grouped only through overlap with a third isoform were not
considered to represent the same gene. All Pearson correlations
were calculated based on log-transformed expression. False
discovery and false negative rates were estimated using the
algorithm presented in Figure S3, which seeks to correct for the
presence of spurious reads mapping to non-expressed genes. The
extent of leaky ubiquitous transcription by comparison of the
ubiquitous set of genes to shuffled controls (Figure S4).
Gene ontology and CpG content
For three mouse tissues, we calculated RPKM values in the
same way as had been done for the human ones. Mouse genes
were matched to human orthologs using Entrez Gene. A list of
acute-phase genes was taken from http://www.informatics.jax.
org. DAVID [53] was used for finding enriched gene ontology
categories. Categorization of promoters by CpG content was
performed as described in [29]. Transcription factor annotations
are from [54].
Non-coding RNA
RefSeq gene annotation was used for protein-coding RNA (i.e.
accessions starting with NM_) and curated non-coding RNA
(NR_). We used the liftOver tool from the UCSC genome browser
to obtain human positions for lincRNA regions from [21].
Transcriptome analysis with FRACT
GO annotations for Ensembl transcripts were downloaded from
Ensembl (BioMart). The read density for each transcript in each
tissue was distributed among its annotated GO categories (total
transcript density/no. GO categories for the transcript). GO
categories were sorted by the total transcriptome density across
tissues and cell lines, and the 400 categories with greatest density
(accounting for 94% of total density) were aggregated into 17
broad classes; the remaining categories (6% of total transcriptome
density) were aggregated into an ‘‘other’’ class (see Dataset S4 for
mappings). The total density of transcripts devoted to each class in
each tissue was tabulated. The coefficient of variation in the
fraction of each transcriptome devoted to different classes was
computed, and a Z-score for each class was computed to identify
particular tissues which devote a significantly different fraction of
the transcriptome to particular classes (|Z-score|.2).
Length of the untranslated regions
The UTR lengths were calculated as the number of reads in a
UTR divided by the number of reads in CDS multiplied by the
CDS length. For the expression weighted average gene lengths, we
used the CDS length from Refseq gene annotation, but weighted
according to the expression of each gene. To see the correlation
between mRNA length and abundance, we took the CDS length
from RefSeq annotation for gene isoforms and added UTR length
according to the distribution of reads in the three regions. Only
those expressed above 0.3 RPKM were included, in order to
exclude genes with few reads that could drive an artificial
correlation. To compare 39 bias between samples, i.e. to what
extent genes get more reads as you go in the 39 direction, we
plotted the average read density for all genes (weighted so that
each gene contributed equally) across the coding region and fit a
line y = kx+m where y = read density, x = location along coding
region, and k/m is a measure of 39 bias.
