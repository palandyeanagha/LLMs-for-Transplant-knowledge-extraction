Abstract
Background & Aims: Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is characterized by high 
short-term mortality and systemic inflammation (SI). Recently, different cardiodynamic 
states were shown to independently predict outcomes in cirrhosis. The relationship 
between cardiodynamic states, SI, and portal hypertension and their impact on ACLF 
development remains unclear. The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate the inter￾play of cardiodynamic state and SI on fatal ACLF development in cirrhosis.
Results: At inclusion, hemodynamic measures including cardiac index (CI) and hepatic 
venous pressure gradient of 208 patients were measured. Patients were followed 
prospectively for fatal ACLF development (primary endpoint). SI was assessed by 
proinflammatory markers such as interleukins (ILs) 6 and 8 and soluble IL-33 recep￾tor (sIL-33R). Patients were divided according to CI (<3.2; 3.2-4.2; >4.2 L/min/m2
) 
in hypo- (n = 84), normo- (n = 69) and hyperdynamic group (n = 55). After a median 
follow-up of 3 years, the highest risk of fatal ACLF was seen in hyperdynamic (35%) 
and hypodynamic patients (25%) compared with normodynamic (14%) (P = .011). 
Hyperdynamic patients showed the highest rate of SI. The detectable level of IL-6 
was an independent predictor of fatal ACLF development.
Conclusions: Cirrhotic patients with hyperdynamic and hypodynamic circulation 
have a higher risk of fatal ACLF. Therefore, the cardiodynamic state is strongly as￾sociated with SI, which is an independent predictor of development of fatal ACLF.

1 | INTRODUCTION
In the natural history of cirrhosis, acute decompensations (AD) are 
frequent and often lead to development of acute-on-chronic liver 
failure (ACLF),1,2 a syndrome characterized by organ failure and high 
short-term mortality.2,3 The pathophysiological pathways leading to 
this syndrome are only partly understood but systemic inflamma￾tion (SI) seems to play a crucial role.4
 SI can occur in the setting of 
chronic inflammation via translocated proinflammatory signals from 
the intestinal lumen to the systemic circulation.5-8 A full-blown burst 
of proinflammatory mediators has been found in patients with ACLF.9
Portal hypertension is a prerequisite for AD and can be quantified by 
measurement of the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG).10,11
In patients with clinically significant portal hypertension 
(CSPH), SI measured by C-reactive protein (CRP) and hypodynamic 
[defined by cardiac index (CI) <3.2 L/min/m2
] and hyperdynamic 
(defined by CI >4.2 L/min/m2
) cardiodynamic states have been in￾dependently associated with an increased risk of first ascites de￾velopment and mortality.12 In addition, SI as assessed by IL-6 and 
IL-8 plays a crucial role in AD.4,9 In outpatients with cirrhosis, ar￾terial hypotension, as an element of cardiocirculatory dysfunction, 
has also been identified as an independent risk factor for ACLF 
development.13
To date, neither the interplay between cardiodynamic states or 
markers of SI, other than CRP, nor their relation with ACLF develop￾ment have been studied.14
The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate the risk of fatal 
ACLF development in different cardiodynamic states and their asso￾ciation with SI. We hypothesize that a hypo- as well a hyperdynamic 
circulatory state represents a risk factor for the development of ACLF.
2 | PATIENTS AND METHODS
2.1 | Patients and data collection
In this retrospective analysis of a prospectively observed patient co￾hort from a single centre study, 224 outpatients with cirrhosis were 
referred to the Department of Clinical Physiology and Gastro Unit 
Hvidovre Hospital, Denmark, between 2002 and 2016 for per pro￾tocol hemodynamic assessment. Inclusion criteria were as follows: 
age above 18 years; diagnosis of cirrhosis based on histological find￾ings or clinical, biochemical, ultrasonographic and/or endoscopic 
findings; and hemodynamic evaluation including HVPG and cardiac 
output (CO). Exclusion criteria were as follows: age under 18 years; 
variceal bleeding, refractory ascites, hepatorenal syndrome, bacte￾rial infection, at time of inclusion and malignancy. Cardiovascular dis￾ease was ruled out. Fulfilment of ACLF criteria was not evaluated at

Key points
• Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is suggested to be 
associated with systemic inflammation (SI).
• The impact of systemic circulation (cardiodynamic state) 
and SI on ACLF development is not fully elucidated.
• This study shows that cirrhotic patients with hyperdy￾namic and hypodynamic circulatory state have a higher 
risk of fatal ACLF.
• Hyperdynamic state is strongly associated with SI, which 
independently predicts fatal ACLF development.

inclusion and records of non-fatal ACLF were therefore not primarily 
recorded.3
Blood samples were collected at the time of the enrolment and 
patients were followed until October 2017. Primary endpoint was 
fatal ACLF defined as ACLF leading to death. The ACLF definition ac￾cording to the CLIF consortium was established in 2013 and the ACLF 
diagnosis was therefore established retrospectively.3
 Causes of death 
that were recorded as liver failure, sepsis and multiorgan failure were 
classified as fatal ACLF. Non-specified shock, cardiovascular disease, 
malignancy and unknown causes were classified as non-ACLF deaths.
Biochemical blood analyses were performed using standard tests.
Written informed consent was obtained from included patients; 
the study was approved by the local ethics committee and Data 
Protection Agency (J-No.2008-41-2020 and HVH-2011-02).
2.2 | Assessment of circulating levels of biomarkers
After collection, blood samples were centrifuged at 4ºC and serum 
samples were stored at −80ºC. Serum concentrations of interleu￾kins (ILs) IL-6, IL-8 and the soluble IL-33 receptor (sIL-33R) were as￾sessed. The analyses were performed with DuoSet® Elisa kits (R&D 
Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Table S1), at 
the Department of Internal Medicine I, Bonn, Germany. The ILs and 
sIL-33R levels were quantified in undiluted serum samples. On all 
ELISA plates, two patient serum samples were used as controls ac￾cessing variability within plates. CRP as a common marker of SI was 
not part of the routine analysis in this study.
Undetectable levels were assigned a value equal to lower limit 
of detection,4,15 whereas for values higher than the upper limit of 
detection concentrations were extrapolated using GraphPad Prism 
version 5.00 (GraphPad Prism Software) according to the plotted 
standard curve.
2.3 | Assessment of hemodynamic parameters
All patients underwent a hemodynamic investigation in the morning 
after an overnight fast and at least 1-hour rest in the supine position 
under local analgesia. None of the patients received diuretics or beta 
blockers in the 24 hours preceding investigations.
Catheterization of the hepatic veins and right atrium was performed 
as previously described.16 A Swan-Ganz catheter, size 7F, was guided 
to the hepatic veins and right atrium via the femoral route under fluo￾roscopy control. Pressures were measured by a capacitance transducer 
(Simonsen & Weel, Copenhagen, Denmark) in the wedged and free 
hepatic vein position in at least three different vessels, the midaxillary 
line being zero pressure level. Mean values of repetitive measurements 
were used. HVPG was determined as wedged minus free hepatic ve￾nous pressure. Right atrial pressure (RAP) was measured directly.
A small indwelling polyethylene catheter was placed in the fem￾oral artery by the Seldinger technique and advanced to the aortic 
bifurcation, and the systolic, diastolic and mean arterial (MAP) blood 
pressures were measured directly. All the pressures were expressed 
in millimetres of mercury.
Cardiac output (expressed in L/min) was measured by the indica￾tor dilution technique after a bolus injection of 150 kBq of 125I-labeled 
human serum albumin (IFE IT. 205, Institute of Energy Technique) 
into the right atrium, followed by arterial sampling. CI was calculated 
as CO/body surface area (BSA) and expressed in L/min/m2
.
Systemic vascular resistance [SVR = ((MAP − RAP)/CO) × 80; 
expressed in dynes·s/cm−5], and systemic vascular resistance index 
[SVRI = ((MAP − RAP)/CI) × 80; expressed in dynes·s/cm−5/m2
] were 
also calculated. Heart rate was determined by electrocardiography.
2.4 | Statistical analysis
Data are presented as median and ranges or absolute frequency and 
percentage, if not otherwise specified.
Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis and Chi-square tests were used 
for unpaired comparisons. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
analysis was used to calculate cut-off values. Kaplan-Meier curves 
and log-rank tests were used to analyse rates of fatal ACLF devel￾opment and all-cause mortality. Spearman's correlation was used to 
evaluate the relationship between inflammatory markers and hemo￾dynamic parameters. Univariate Cox regression was used to identify 
predictors of ACLF. Parameters with a P value < .05 (P-in) and P-out 
value of .1 entered the multivariate, forward step-wise regression 
model. To avoid multicollinearity in multivariate regression, model 
of end-stage liver disease (MELD) and European Foundation for the 
study of chronic liver failure consortium (CLIF-C AD) scores and 
their included variables, main systemic hemodynamic parameters 
and their dependent parameters (such as the calculated systemic 
vascular resistance) were included separately. Principal compo￾nents analysis was performed to reduce number of variables that 
influence regression analysis. In principal component analysis, linear 
combinations of all available variables were created. Patients were 
then plotted according to the created principal components.
The significance level for all tests was set at P-value < .05. 
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS V25 (IBM SPSS 
Statistics for Macintosh, Version 25.0: IBM Corp). Principal compo￾nents analysis was performed using R (R core team, Version 3.6.0).

3.1 | General characteristics of patients
In total, 208 patients (73% male, 77% alcoholic cirrhosis and median 
age 60 years) were included in the final analyses (Table 1). Median 
Child-Pugh, MELD and CLIF-C AD scores were 7, 11 and 50 points. At 
inclusion, none of the patients with alcoholic cirrhosis had acute alco￾holic liver injury according to NIAAA criteria (at least 3 of the follow￾ing: active alcoholism of 6 months >40 g/d for female or >60 g/d for 
male, bilirubin >3 mg/dL, AST >50IE, AST/alanine transaminase (ALT)

>1.4, AST or ALT >400 IE). Patients with viral hepatitis were untreated 
at inclusion.
Regarding comorbidities 44 patients (21%) were diabetic and 
115 (55%) had arterial hypertension. Overweight and obesity were 
found in 69 (33%) and 38 (18%) patients respectively.
The median MAP was 90 mmHg (57-146), HVPG was 
16 mmHg (6-33), CI was 3.4 L/min/m2
 (1.6-6.3) and median sys￾temic vascular resistance index (SVRI) was 2020 dynes·s·cm−5·m2
(911-4715).
At inclusion, no patient had ACLF. Eighty-two patients died (39%) 
and 50 (24%) developed fatal ACLF. Median time to all-cause mor￾tality was 18 months (0-137) and fatal ACLF was 17 months (0-137). 
None of the patients underwent liver transplantation or transjugular 
intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement.
Plasma levels of IL-6, IL-8 and sIL-33R were detectable in 66 
(32%), 74 (36%) and 208 (100%) patients as shown in Table 2. There 
was no significant difference in the levels of IL-6, IL-8 and sIL-33R 
between the time eras (2002-2011 vs 2012-2016), suggesting stabil￾ity of the measured cytokines in the blood samples stored over the 
years of the study (Table S2).
3.2 | Characteristics of patients stratified by 
cardiodynamic state
Based on cut-offs of CI as previously applied,12 84 (40%) patients 
showed hypodynamic (<3.2 L/min/m2
), 69 (33%) patients normo￾dynamic (3.2-4.2 L/min/m2
) and 55 patients (27%) hyperdynamic 
(>4.2 L/min/m2
) cardiodynamic state (Table 1).
Hypodynamic patients were significantly older compared with 
hyperdynamic patients. In comparison with hypo- and normodynamic 
patients, the hyperdynamic patients had significantly higher MELD, 
as well as lower blood haemoglobin (Hb) and lower plasma albumin 
concentrations and higher rate of ascites.
In total, 39 patients (19%) were treated with non-selective 
beta blockers (NSBB) and 8 patients (4%) received other beta 
blockers. The proportion of patients treated with NSBB was high￾est in the hypodynamic group (n = 18, 21%) and lowest in the 
hyperdynamic group (n = 8, 15%). There was no significant dif￾ference between the three cardiodynamic groups with respect to 
NSBB treatment.
The hypo- and hyperdynamic patients had similar level of arte￾rial blood pressure, but MAP was lower than in the normodynamic 
patients. The SVRI was normal in 33%, 39% and 0% in hypodynamic, 
normodynamic and hyperdynamic patients. Hyperdynamic patients 
had higher HVPG (median 18 mmHg), than the remaining patients 
(median 15 mmHg).
ACLF was the cause of death in 68%, 66% and 45% of hyper￾dynamic, hypodynamic and normodynamic patients respectively 
(Table 3). The cumulative probability of fatal ACLF in the three 
groups was 35%, 25% and 14% (P = .006, Figure 1A). After 1 year, 
the numbers were 20%, 8% and 3% (P < .01) respectively. The all￾cause mortality at the end of follow-up and after 1 year was also 
higher in the hyperdynamic group and lowest in the normodynamic 
group (Figure 1B, Table 1).
Most common known trigger of fatal ACLF was infection in 
20%. There were no differences between ACLF triggers within 
cardiodynamic groups but a trend showing higher rates of infec￾tion-triggered ACLF in patients with hyperdynamic circulation 
(Table S3).
In other settings, normodynamic circulation has been defined 
as CI of 2.5-4.2 L/min/m2
.

according to those cut-offs as well. Kaplan-Meier plot for fatal ACLF 
development that hypodynamic circulation shows similar results 
with even worse outcome for patients with hypodynamic circula￾tion. Normodynamic patients had the lowest while hyperdynamic 
patients the highest rate of fatal ACLF development (Figure S1).
3.3 | Inflammatory markers in different 
cardiodynamic states
In the assessment of the SI,18-21 patients were divided into 
those with detectable and undetectable levels of IL-6 and IL-8 
(Figure 2A,B). Among those with detectable levels, the IL-6 
was 48.7 (10.2-1248.2) and IL-8 was 79.8 (32.4-1464.4) pg/mL 
(Table 2). The hyperdynamic group showed the highest rate of de￾tection of inflammatory biomarkers, but no difference in detec￾tion rate was seen between the hypo- and normodynamic groups 
(Table 2). Similar results were obtained, when the patients were 
stratified for the 2.5-4.2 L/min/m2
 cut-offs (Table S4). sIL-33R 
levels were detectable in all patients 15 917.2 pg/ml (1430.6-
15917.2). A cut-off of 7380.2 pg/ml was chosen based on the ROC 
analysis (Figure 2C). Across all cardiodynamic states patients, with 
ascites showed higher rates of detectable SI markers compared 
with patients without ascites (Figure 2D).
Looking at the concentrations of the inflammatory markers, in 
the hyperdynamic patients, levels of IL-8 and sIL-33R were higher 
compared with normodynamic patients, but the difference was not 
statistically significant. In hyperdynamic patients, levels of IL-8 were 
significantly higher compared with hypodynamic patients (Table 2).
IL-6, IL-8 and sIL-33R showed highly significant correlation with 
HVPG, whereas IL-8 was significantly correlated with CO. Inversely, 
SVR and MAP showed a negative correlation with IL-6 and IL-8 and 
sIL-33R respectively (Figure 2E).
To minimize confounding factors, we performed a principal 
component analysis and created linear combinations of all avail￾able variables for the presence of hypo- and hyperdynamic states. 
Inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 transformed into principal 
component 1 (PC1 in Figure 2F). Hemodynamic parameters CO 
and SVR transformed with Hb into principal component 2 (PC2 
in Figure 2F). Plotting of patients clearly showed that hyperdy￾namic patients cluster with each other as well as hypodynamic pa￾tients. The clusters are separated mostly on the axis representing 
the principal component 1 (x-axis). These results suggest a main 
contribution of inflammatory cytokines to distinguish between 
hypo- and hyperdynamic patients. By definition, hypo- and hyper￾dynamic patients are distinguished on the axis of principal com￾ponent 2, which is consists of cardiodynamic parameters (CO and 
SVR) (Figure 2F).
3.4 | SI predicts development of fatal ACLF
Among the univariate analyses, predictors of fatal ACLF included 
age, MELD, Child-Pugh and CLIF-C AD scores, Hb, bilirubin, albu￾min, MAP, hyperdynamic state, SVRI, HVPG ≥16 mmHg (median), 
ascites, sIL-33R and IL-6 (Table 4). Owing to relatively long inclu￾sion period we analysed time effects on survival, but time era of 
inclusion (2002-2011 vs 2012-2016) was not a significant predictor. 
Multivariate analysis including all significant factors from univariate 
analysis identified age, low albumin and detectable IL-6 as independ￾ent predictors of fatal ACLF. NSBB therapy was not significant in 
either analysis.

4 | DISCUSSION
The main findings of our study are that in patients with cirrhosis the 
prevalence of fatal ACLF is high, significantly relating to all-cause 
mortality in hypo- and hyperdynamic states. The findings support 
the previous study by Turco et al showing that the cardiodynamic 
state is associated with the development of ascites and death. 
Moreover, the risk of developing of fatal ACLF seems related to both 
the type of cardiodynamic state and degree of SI.12
We found a strong circuital correlation among plasma ILs, HVPG 
and CO. Moreover, we showed that patients with a CI >4.2 L/min/
m2
 had significantly higher rate of detectable circulating IL-6/-8 in 
comparison to patients with lower CI at baseline. This adds further 
granularity to previous findings that extreme cardiodynamic states 
and SI as determined by circulating CRP are independent predictors 
of outcomes in compensated patients and in those with ascites.12
Indeed, CRP did not capture the differences in the degree of SI 
among cardiodynamic states.12 This underlines the need for more 
specific markers of SI in this setting. Detectable levels of IL-6, which 
has been selected as an independent predictor of fatal ACLF devel￾opment in our cohort, may be an appropriate candidate for such a 
purpose.
The interrelation between degree of portal hypertension and 
CO has been pivotal in the classical vasodilation hypothesis of portal 
hypertension in cirrhosis.5-8 Moreover, this pathophysiological view 
represents the rational basis for the use of NSBB in the treatment and 
prevention of portal hypertensive complications.22-24 Nevertheless, 
considering that CI >4.2 L/min/m2
 is found almost only in patients 
with CSPH, it is tempting to hypothesize that inflammation may be 
a main pathogenetic driver of disease progression in hyperdynamic 
cirrhotic patients.25-29 As this study demonstrates the relationship 
between SI and cardiodynamic state, it points to the need of a better 
stratification of patients at risk for development of ACLF and delin￾eation of potential therapeutic targets.

It has been shown that patients with decompensated cirrhosis 
are those with the most pronounced circulatory dysfunction (hyper￾dynamic/hypodynamic circulation).30 At the same time, patients with 
decompensated cirrhosis are at higher risk of developing further AD 
and ACLF. Importantly, neither hyperdynamic circulation nor decom￾pensated state (AD with previous ascites) was independent predic￾tors of fatal ACLF development in our cohort, whereas SI (measured 
by IL-6) was. This suggests SI as an additional crucial risk factor for 
fatal ACLF development despite the association with decompen￾sated states and hyperdynamic cardiodynamic states of cirrhosis.
However, patients with ascites had higher rates of detectable SI 
markers compared with patients without ascites, especially signifi￾cant in the normodynamic group. This finding adds to recent stud￾ies that showed levels of SI markers in compensated cirrhosis were 
moderately altered compared with healthy controls and markedly 
increased in decompensated cirrhosis without ACLF.9
 Moreover, 
our data are supported by recent studies showing that CRP levels 
progressively increase from compensated to decompensated pa￾tients.12,26 The cause-effect relationship between AD and SI remains 
unclear but current data suggest that SI is a prerequisite for develop￾ment of the decompensated state and further progression to ACLF. 
However, in the presence of a similar activation of SI, patients with 
a hypodynamic circulatory state may face a higher risk of developing 
ACLF than those patients with a normodynamic circulation. These 
data outline the need of further exploration of the complex circuital 
interaction of hepatic and cardiac hemodynamics and inflammation 
in determining organ damage, AD and fatal ACLF in patients with 
hypodynamic features.
Hemodynamic assessments and cytokine levels represent a 
snapshot of the patients’ current status. However, by definition, CI at 
rest in supine position is supposed to be stable in not acutely altered 
patients. Transitory conditions such as sepsis have been excluded at 
the time of catheterization. Favourably, future studies should per￾form repeated cardiodynamic assessments in case of availability of 
experimental treatments targeting the heart function or SI.
However, in clinical routine invasive hemodynamic assessment is 
resource intense. Among non-invasive methods, finometer is avail￾able for evaluation of CO. Moreover, echocardiography is widely 
available. Especially, more sophisticated techniques, such as speckle 
tracking echocardiography (STE), were shown to be able to predict 
ACLF development in patients with TIPS.31,32 STE therefore seems 
to be a promising tool for non-invasive assessment of cardiodynam￾ics and its impact on ACLF development should be investigated in 
future studies.
Interestingly, IL-6 was detectable in only 32% of patients in our 
cohort. A recent study by Clària et al comparing cytokine levels in 
healthy subjects, cirrhotic inpatients without ACLF and cirrhotic in￾patients with ACLF showed lower rates of undetectable levels in both 
cirrhotic cohorts (eg IL-6 without ACLF 7.4%, with ACLF 0.8%), while 
showing high rates of undetectable levels in the healthy cohort (eg 
IL-6 healthy 87.5%).4
 Of note, the cirrhotic inpatients without ACLF 
had a much higher mean MELD of 17 compared with our outpatient 
cohort (median MELD 11). In our cohort of cirrhotic outpatients, we 
found undetectable rates of IL-6 of 55%-71% depending on cardio￾dynamic state. These detection rates fall right between the healthy 
group and cirrhotic inpatients of Clària et al suggesting an association 
of cytokine detection rates with progression of liver disease. The de￾tection rates in our cohort therefore seem expected and reasonable. 
Moreover, this simple and natural cut-off (detectable vs undetectable) 
would allow for semi-quantitative testing to identify patients at risk.
Our study has several limitations. First, no data on cardiovas￾cular diseases and cirrhotic cardiomyopathy were available. In ad￾dition, no data on alcohol consumption in follow-up, episodes of 
AD and non-fatal ACLF were collected and no data of trigger and 
degree of ACLF were available, which is a major limitation. Finally, 
even though NSBB were paused 24 hours before hemodynamic 
evaluation, it might not be completely eliminated at time of eval￾uation. Therefore, we cannot determine the hemodynamic state 
of those patients without any NSBB effect. Likewise, it is equally 
possible that NSBB have a detrimental effect in some and a protec￾tive one in other patients in terms of fatal ACLF development. It is 
likely that some patients originally hyper- or normodynamic have 
been classified as hypodynamic after introducing NSBB. Patients 
who were already hypodynamic are unlikely to be “good cardiac 
responders” to NSBB. Patients sensitive to NSBB would develop 
severe hypotension and/or intolerance to incremental dosages. 
Patients insensitive to NSBB might have impaired cardiosystemic 
response to stress either way.
5 | CONCLUSION
This study shows that in patients with cirrhosis the risk of develop￾ing fatal ACLF is independently associated with the degree of SI, 
which is associated with cardiodynamic state. Accordingly, further 
stratification may help in the identification of novel therapeutic 
targets.
