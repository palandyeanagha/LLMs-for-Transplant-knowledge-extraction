Aim: To investigate the morphology and function of platelets in nephropathic cystinosis (NC).
Methods: Seven patients (mean age, 6.5 years; SD, 20 months) with NC were investigated. Their platelets
were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and the characteristics of the dense granules
(DGs) were determined by mepacrine labelling and the uranaffin reaction. Bleeding time, turbidometric
aggregation, and luminescence aggregation were studied and intraplatelet cystine was measured.
Results: Increased intraplatelet cystine, primary and secondary aggregation defects, and the absence of
ATP release were demonstrated. TEM revealed DGs of various shapes and sizes and lamellary or
amorphous cytoplasmic inclusions. Viscous material had been released into the vacuolar spaces and
enlarged open canalicular system. Mepacrine labelling revealed that the numbers of DGs/platelet were
comparable between the patients and the controls (mean, 2.9 (SD, 0.22) v 3.32 (0.18); p = 0.34). The
uranaffin reaction revealed that the numbers of type 1, 3, and 4 DGs were comparable between the
patients and the controls, but that there were fewer type 2 DGs in the patients (mean, 8.5 (SD, 1.95) v
17.22 (1.58); p = 0.01). TEM for platelet aggregation revealed a lack of induction and/or defective
execution and/or delayed transmission. The patients’ intraplatelet cystine concentrations were higher than
the controls (mean, 1.56 (SD, 0.84) v 0.08 (0.01) nmol/mg protein; p = 0.009).
Conclusions: This is the first report to demonstrate raised intraplatelet cystine, abnormal platelet
ultrastructural findings, and defective aggregation in NC.
Cystinosis is a disorder with autosomal recessive
transmission caused by defective carrier mediated
transport of the amino acid cystine across the lysosomal
membrane.1 In the ‘‘nephropathic’’ form of the disease,
children develop renal Fanconi syndrome, usually at around
6–12 months of age, and then hypothyroidism, photophobia,
chronic renal failure, myopathy, difficulty in swallowing, retinal
blindness, diabetes mellitus, male hypogonadism, pulmo￾nary dysfunction, and central nervous system dysfunction.1 2
‘‘Cystinosis is a disorder with autosomal recessive
transmission caused by defective carrier mediated trans￾port of the amino acid cystine across the lysosomal
membrane’’
Although functional abnormalities of various organs
associated with this disorder have been well defined, platelets
have not been studied before. Upon observation of prolonged
bleeding at the venipuncture sites in a child with nephro￾pathic cystinosis (NC), we planned to evaluate the functions
and electron microscopic features of platelets from this
patient along with other patients previously diagnosed with
NC.
METHODS
Patients
All of the patients (n = 7; mean age, 6.5 years; SD, 20
months; six male; one female) with the diagnosis of NC were
followed up at the division of nutrition and metabolism,
Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey. They were diagnosed
at 12–21 months of age. Parents were first or second degree
relatives in five of the seven families. Two patients were
siblings (patients 6 and 7). All of the patients met the criteria
for NC. Table 1 provides some of the patients’ laboratory and
clinical features. At the time of evaluation, only two patients,
who had chronic renal failure (CRF), complained of
prolonged bleeding from cuts or venipuncture sites and easy
bruising (patients 1 and 6). All had been taking cysteamine,
Joule and Scholl solutions, and vitamin D3. The bicarbonate
value was normal in all of the patients and renal function
tests were normal at the time of evaluation except for the two
patients with CRF (patients 1 and 6). Patients 6 and 7 were
lost to follow up during our study, so that tests other than
platelet aggregation could be performed for patients 1–5 only.
An ATP release study could be performed in three patients
only. The control group was made up of five healthy subjects.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
Venous blood drawn from the patients was mixed with acid
citrate dextrose anticoagulant in a 6 to 1 ratio and platelet
rich plasma (PRP) was prepared by centrifugation at 150 6g
for 20 minutes at room temperature. After fixation in 3%
gluteraldehyde in phosphate buffer, platelets were washed
with phosphate buffer. Postfixation with 1% osmium tetr￾oxide was performed and the specimens were dehydrated in a
graded series of alcohol and embedded in araldite. Ultrathin
serial sections were cut on a Leica Ultracut R ultramicrotome
(Leica, Vienna, Austria), stained with uranyl acetate and lead
citrate, and examined by a Leo 906 E TEM.3

Mepacrine labelling of the dense granules
Blood was collected in a plastic tube containing ACD
solution. PRP was prepared by centrifugation at 100 6g for
10 minutes at 14˚C. Mepacrine (1mM; Sigma, St Louis,
Missouri, USA) was added to 1 ml of PRP and the solution
was incubated for 20 minutes at 37˚C.4 5 Samples were then
resuspended in buffer (130 mmol NaCl, 5 mmol KCl, 1 mmol
NaH2PO4, 24 mmol NaHCO3, 2 mmol EDTA Na2, 10 mmol
glucose, and 12.5 mmol saccharose, pH 7.4) to a final platelet
concentration of 400 6 109
/litre. A drop of this suspension
was placed on a slide and a coverslip was applied. The
greenish yellow fluorescent dense granules (DGs) were
visualised under a fluorescent microscope (Zeiss Axoscope;
Zeiss, Thornwood, New York, USA). The DGs were counted in
84–106 platelets for each sample. The results were presented
as the mean DG number/platelet.
Uranaffin reaction on thin section electron microscopy
The patients’ gluteraldehyde fixed platelets were washed for
five minutes, resuspended, and centrifuged three times in
0.9% NaCl. After the third wash, the platelets were combined
with 4% uranyl acetate in distilled water at pH 3.9.
Incubation was continued at 4˚C for 24–48 hours. The treated
samples were washed twice for five minutes each with
distilled water, centrifuged to form pellets, and combined
with 2% osmic acid in 0.2 mol/litre cacodylate buffer for 90
minutes at 4˚C. The samples were then dehydrated in
alcohols and embedded in Ara Idit CY 212.3 The uronaffin
stained platelets were classified depending on the nature of
their electron dense core materials according to Weiss and
colleagues3 as follows: type 1, containing solid cores occupy￾ing more than 50% of the granule interior; type 2, containing
solid cores occupying less than 50% of the granule interior;
type 3, containing fragmented cores; and type 4, containing
no visible cores.
Examination of platelet function
Bleeding time was measured by the modified Ivy method
using a ‘‘template device’’ (Simplate R; Organon Teknika
GmbH, Eppelheim, Germany). The patients were instructed
to avoid aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
for 10 days before bleeding time and platelet aggregation
testing.
Turbidometric and luminescence aggregation tests were
carried out on a Chrono-log 560 Ca aggregometer, with minor
modifications of the methods described previously.6 Blood
samples were collected with minimum trauma in 3.8%
trisodium citrate (1/9 dilution) containing tubes. All studies
were performed within two hours of blood collection. PRP
and platelet poor plasma (PPP) were obtained by centrifuging
the anticoagulated blood samples for 10 minutes at 700 6g
and for 15 minutes at 5000 6g, respectively. For turbido￾metric tests, PRP and PPP samples were placed into
siliconised aggregation cuvettes with a reusable stir bar in
500 ml aliquots. After five minutes, 100% and 0% baselines
were set and reagent induced aggregation was observed after
a further five minutes in 1000 6g stirred samples. Platelet
aggregation was studied with collagen (2 mg/ml), ristocetin
(1.25 mg/ml), and two different concentrations of ADP (2mM
and 10mM). For lumiaggregometry, 450 ml PRP and 50 ml
luciferin–luciferase were placed into a siliconised aggregation
cuvette with a reusable stir bar. After five minutes, platelet
aggregation was induced with 2mM and 10mM ADP and the
amount of ATP released was calculated by means of a control
luminescence spike induced by a 2mM ATP standard. The
tests were repeated at least twice. Aggregation studies were
performed at 37˚C.
TEM evaluation of platelet aggregation
PRP was obtained as described above. After the addition of
2mM ADP, samples were removed at the second, eighth, and
14th minutes for both the patients and the controls and were
prepared for TEM.
Determination of intraplatelet cystine concentrations
When determining intraplatelet cystine values, we also
evaluated the concentration of cystine in leucocytes as a
comparison. Blood cell isolation and determination of the
intraplatelet and leucocyte cystine concentrations were
performed according to the white cell cystine group protocols
reported previously.7 8 Fresh blood samples were taken from
five patients and five healthy children, directly into an acid/
citrate/dextrose anticoagulant. Platelets and leucocytes were
isolated from blood samples using HistopaqueH (Sigma,
Poole, Dorset, UK), which contains polysucrose (60 g/litre)
and has a 1.119 g/ml density, as the separating medium. At
least 10 ml of blood was slowly overlayed on to 3.5 ml of
Histopaque in a 15 ml test tube. All steps were performed at
4˚C unless stated otherwise. Centrifugation was performed at
350 6g for 15 minutes at 20˚C. PRP was carefully removed
from the top and transferred into 3 ml polycarbonate
centrifuge tubes. The next layer, which contained the

remaining platelets, was aspirated and discarded and the last
layer, which was just above the red blood cells and contained
leucocytes, was transferred into another 10 ml centrifuge
tube. The platelets were washed and centrifuged twice at
1750 6g for 10 minutes, and the final pellet was resuspended
in 0.2 ml of distilled water. The leucocyte layer was
centrifuged at 1000 6g for five minutes and the supernatant
was discarded. The pellet was washed repeatedly with
distilled water to haemolyse the red blood cells until a clear
leucocyte solution was obtained. The clear leucocyte pellet
was resuspended with 0.2 ml distilled water. The final
suspensions of platelets and leucocytes were sonicated on
ice three times for 10 seconds, with cooling intervals of 10
seconds. The suspensions were centrifuged at 15000 6g for
10 minutes. Protein concentrations in the supernatants
were determined with microprotein-PRTM kit (Sigma) on a
Hitachi P800 autoanalyser. Next, the supernatants were
deproteinised by the addition of SERAPREPTM (Pickering
Laboratories, Mountain View, California, USA) at a ratio of 1
to 1, an internal standard was added (sarcosine, 10 mmol/
litre), and they were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 15000 6g.
Finally the cystine concentration of the supernatants was
measured by ion exchange high performance liquid chroma￾tography with post column derivatisation by ninhydrin
(Series 1100 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, California,
USA) combined with PCX 3100 post-column reaction module
(Pickering Laboratories).
Statistics
The Mann Whitney U test was performed for comparison of
the mean granule number/platelet, the cystine concentrations
within the platelets and leucocytes, and the different types of
uranaffin granules in the patients compared with those of the
control group.
RESULTS
Platelet and dense granule morphology evaluated by
TEM
Dense granules varied in size and shape, with most being
round and some being oval (control, fig 1A; patients fig 1B,
C). Some platelets showed features of immaturity, such as
those from patient 4, which contained Golgi complex (fig 1C).
The platelets of all patients contained a bundle of micro￾tubules around the periphery, which gave them their
lenticular shape (fig 1B, C). There were many vacuolar
spaces, which were composed of viscous, electron dense
material (fig 2A). All of the patients’ platelets contained
heterogeneous cytoplasmic inclusions of various sizes, which
were lamellous or amorphous in nature and were not
encircled by a unit membrane (figs 1B, C, 2B). Myelin
figures were seen in some of these inclusions (figs 1B, 2B).
Interestingly, the same kind of cytoplasmic inclusion was
also detected in the cytoplasm of a lymphocyte from patient 3
(fig 2C). Centrifugation caused spontaneous platelet release
reactions (figs 1C, 2B) and the cytoplasmic inclusions were
seen to be intact in those platelets during spontaneous
release. The released material seen nearby the platelets had
viscous, amorphous, and lamellary characteristics (fig 2B).
The uranaffin reaction on thin section electron microscopy
was used to classify the dense granules into types 1–4. Mean
(SD) values for the patients versus the controls were: type 1
granules in 40.31% (10.13%) versus 31.2% (4.11%)
(p = 0.67); type 2 in 8.51% (1.95%) versus 17.22% (1.58%)
(p = 0.01); type 3 in 31.42% (8.45%) versus 37.98% (2.21%)
(p = 0.91); and type 4 in 19.73% (3.31%) versus 13.6%
(1.86%) (p = 0.11) of all DGs (fig 2D).
DGs evaluated by fluorescence microscopy
The mean (SD) number of fluorescent granules/platelet was
2.9 (0.2) in the patients and 3.3 (0.2) in the controls
(p = 0.34).
Aggregation tests
The bleeding time was prolonged in four of the seven
patients. Primary or secondary aggregation defects were seen
with 2mM ADP in five of the seven patients. By increasing the
ADP dose to 10mM in four of these five patients, normal

aggregation was attained in one, and minimal improvement
was seen in the other three. Collagen (2 mg/ml) and
epinephrine (10mM) induced platelet aggregation were found
to be defective in one of the seven and three of the five
patients studied, respectively. The absence of ATP release was
confirmed by lumiaggregometry in two of three patients who
had a platelet aggregation defect (table 1); minimal
improvement was seen after increasing the ATP dose to
10mM.
TEM evaluation of platelet aggregation
Second minute
Although the platelets of patients 2, 3, 4, and 5 fitted together
tightly and had abundant pseudopods, as in normal platelets,
those of patient 1 were distant from each other and only a
few displayed pseudopods, which were blunted. Whereas
normal platelets should have released almost all of their
granules by this time, degranulation was seen in almost none
of the platelets from patients 1, 3, and 5 and only in a variable
number of platelets from patients 2 and 4. Granules were still
dispersed throughout the platelet and execution (central
clustering) was present in a few (patient 1) to a moderate
number (patients 3 and 5) of platelets (fig 3).
Eighth minute
Whereas the platelets from patients 2 and 4 still fitted
together tightly, as is normal, the interplatelet distance
increased in patients 3 and 5 compared with the second
minute. The platelets of patient 1 were still remote from each
other. Although some (patients 2, 3, 4, and 5) still had
pseudopods, the platelets from patient 1 had none. In
patients 2 and 4, although degranulation took place in most
of the platelets, a few still showed central clustering of
granules. Platelets from patients 1, 3, and 5 showed different
stages of transformation, some having completely or incom￾pletely degranulated, yielding a enlarged open canalicular
system, some still displaying central clustering of granules,
and some having granules dispersed throughout (fig 3).
14th minute
Although the platelets still fitted together tightly and
displayed pseudopods in patients 2 and 4, as is normal, the
interplatelet distance increased even more than at the eighth
minute in patients 1, 3, and 5. In patients 2 and 4, central
clustering of granules was not seen, and most of the platelets
were degranulated and displayed an enlarged open canali￾cular system. In a few, granules persisted throughout the
platelet, implying partial degranulation. Some platelets from
patients 3 and 5 still displayed pseudopods and were still in
different stages of transformation, with most showing
granules dispersed throughout the platelet and some having
partially or completely degranulated, yielding an enlarged
open canalicular system to a varying extent. Pseudopods were
lacking and granules were dispersed throughout most of the
platelets in patient 1.

patients 5 (A), 3 (B), and 4 (D) and a
lymphocyte from patient 3 (C) (original
magnifications: A, 627 800, B,

The enlarged open canalicular system
(O), which is full of lamellary and
amorphous material, and cytoplasmic
amorphous inclusions (single arrow)
can be seen in patient 5 (A). Lamellary
cytoplasmic inclusions (single arrow)
can be seen in the platelets of patient 3
(B). Longitudinal sections of myelin
figures (double arrow) can be seen in
the platelets (B) and a lymphocyte from
the same patient (C). The spontaneous
release of a lamellary, viscous material
is striking (thin arrow) (B). In the
platelets that are undergoing
spontaneous release, the cytoplasmic
vacuoles and accumulations remain
intact (B). Uranaffin staining of platelets
from patient 4 revealed type 1 (one
arrow) dense granules, which
contained solid cores occupying more
than 50% of the granule interior, type 3
(three arrows) granules with a
fragmented core, and type 4 (four
arrows) granules with no visible core
(D).

Evaluation of intraplatelet cystine concentrations
The mean (SD) intraplatelet cystine concentration was higher
in the patients than in the control group (1.56 (0.84) v 0.08
(0.01) nmol/mg protein; p = 0.008). The mean (SD) cystine
concentration within the leucocytes was also higher in the
patients than in the controls (8.64 (3.81) v 0.11 (0.01) nmol/
mg protein; p = 0.008). The mean (SD) protein content of
the platelets (164.4 (81.8) v 407.4 (72.2) mg/dl; p = 0.08)
and the leucocytes (126.2 (42.7) v 165.4 (24.4) mg/dl;
p = 0.29) was similar in the patients and the controls.
Discussion
In cystinosis, free cystine classically accumulates in the
lysosomes, cytoplasm, nucleus, mitochondria,9 10 and the
intracellular spaces of bone marrow in the form of
characteristic crystals, granular, fine, dark material, or with
no visible form in various cells.2 11
We showed that in NC cystine accumulates in platelets in
neither the crystalline nor the darkened material form.
To our knowledge, intraplatelet accumulation of cystine
has not been demonstrated before. In addition, intraplatelet
cystine concentrations seen here may be lower than the
pretreatment values because intraleucocyte values are
reduced by treatment with cysteamine.12 Active pinocytosis
and phagocytosis have been suggested to provide the
mechanism for cystine accumulation, and this has been
demonstrated in polymorphonuclear leucocytes and mono￾cytes, but not in lymphocytes and erythrocytes.11 The
relatively lower concentrations of cystine seen in platelets
compared with leucocytes in our patients may reflect the fact
that endocytosis and pinocytosis (which take place to supply
some of the granule contents) are less active in mega￾karyocytes and platelets than in leucocytes.
It seems reasonable to assume that the lamellary and
amorphous cytoplasmic inclusions in our patients are cystine
accumulations. The existence of the same types of inclusions
in the lymphocytes of patient 3 and their presence in all of
the patients studied is striking. However, we did not
investigate the presence of sulfur in these inclusions or in
other parts of the platelets using electron probes, although
we plan to do so in the near future.
It has been reported that vacuoles and vesicles are parts of
the open canalicular system that have become dilated and are
not characteristic for a particular disorder.13 14 DGs in
different stages of transformation15 and spontaneous platelet
release caused by cytocentrifugation16 are seen normally. It is
striking that the microtubule system is intact, giving the
platelets their lens-like shape. Some of the platelets displayed
features of immaturity, such as the presence of the Golgi
complex seen in patient 4, as seen in preleukaemia.17
The contrast between the morphological changes and the
degree of cystine accumulation in our patients’ platelets
suggests that mechanisms other than cystine accumulation
(which have not been identified yet) may be involved in the
morphological and functional abnormalities of the platelets,
as in the proximal tubuli.10
Among the seven patients, five had abnormal aggregation
tests, four had a prolonged bleeding time (patients 1, 3, 5,
and 6) and only two (patients 1 and 6) had a bleeding
tendency. These findings are similar to previous reports in
that bleeding symptoms and/or abnormal laboratory tests
(bleeding time and/or abnormal aggregation tests) are not
present in all patients with platelet release defects,18–20 so that
electron microscopic analysis is the most reliable tool for the
diagnosis of platelet defects.20 Although CRF cannot be

minute: although the control’s platelets (A) and those of patients 3 (B) and 2 (C) fit tightly together and display abundant pseudopods, those from patient
1 (D) are distant from one another and only a few display pseudopods, which are blunted. Whereas normal platelets have released almost all of their
granules (A), degranulation is seen in almost none of the platelets from patients 1 (D), a few platelets from patient 3 (B), and only in a moderate number
of platelets from patient 2 (C). Granules are still dispersed throughout the platelet and central clustering is present in a few (patient 1; D) to a moderate
number (patient 3; B) of platelets. Eighth minute: whereas the control’s platelets (E) and those of patient 2 (G) still fit tightly together, the interplatelet
distance increased in patient 3 (F) compared with the second minute. The platelets from patient 1 (H) are still remote from each other. Although some
(patients 2 and 3) still have pseudopods (F, G), the platelets from patient 1 have none (H). In patient 2, although degranulation has taken place in most
of the platelets, a few still have granules. Platelets from patients 1 and 3 (H, F) show different stages of transformation: some have completely or
incompletely degranulated, yielding an enlarged open canalicular system, and some have granules dispersed throughout.

6, the prolonged bleeding time and/or abnormal platelet
aggregation seen in the platelets of the patients (2, 3, and 5)
who did not have CRF support the notion that cystinosis is a
cause of platelet dysfunction. None of these patients took
aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or antihista￾mines for 10 days before the tests.
Because exogenous ADP is the main stimulator of DGs and
to a less extent a granules, the lack of mainly secondary
aggregation with ADP stimulation in our patients and the
absence of grey platelets in light microscopic examination led
us to distinguish between the two release defects involving
DGs.18 The first is delta storage pool disease (d-SPD), in
which the numbers of DGs are reduced but central clustering
of the granules after stimulation take place normally, but
temporarily,3 21 and the other is an aspirin-like defect in
which granule numbers are normal but central clustering
does not occur.21 This second defect may be hereditary18 or
may be caused by the ingestion of aspirin and other drugs
(anti-inflammatory agents, phenothiazines, antihistamines,
tricyclic antidepressants),22 and the execution defect may be a
component of aggregation defects in leukaemia23–25 and
refractory anaemia.24
‘‘The aggregation pathology seen in our patients is similar
to that seen in leukaemia and refractory anaemia, rather
than an aspirin-like platelet defect, because it does not just
involve the execution process but also induction and
transmission’’
We first labelled the platelets with mepacrine, a fluorescent
drug that selectively accumulates in platelet DGs, binding to
serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine, and ATP3–5 to determine
the number of DGs precisely, and demonstrated that the
numbers of DGs were similar in patients and controls.
Ultrastructural evaluation of DGs by the uranaffin reaction in
which staining of DG membranes produces different staining
patterns in normal and pathological conditions3 26 27 showed
the predominance of full (type 1) DGs, unlike in d-SPD, in
which the ADP and ATP content of the storage pool is lower
than normal28 29 and empty (type 4) granules predominate.3
After confirming that the DGs of our patients had neither a
quantitative nor morphological defect suggestive of d-SPD,
we examined the ultrastructural changes that take place
during aggregation, to determine whether a functional
abnormality existed.
The ultrastructural platelet analysis of our patients
revealed different degrees of abnormality at different stages
of aggregation. For example, platelets from patients 2 and 4
showed that degranulation took place in most platelets later
than in the controls, but a few incompletely degranulated
platelets were left after 14 minutes. However, platelets from
patients 1, 3, and 5 showed different stages of transforma￾tion, a lack or delay of central clustering of granules, and a
moderate to high number of degranulated platelets.
Adherence established at the second minute of aggregation
was found to disappear at the eighth minute, implying intact
primary but defective secondary aggregation in patients 3 and
5. The lack of evident shape change and few and blunt
pseudopods, in addition to lack of platelet adherence, in
patient 1 at the second minute of aggregation are consistent
with a primary aggregation defect.
The aggregation pathology seen in our patients is similar to
that seen in leukaemia and refractory anaemia,23–25 rather
than an aspirin-like platelet defect, because it does not just
involve the execution process (patients 1, 3, and 5) but also
induction (patient 1) and transmission (patients 2, 4 mainly
and 1, 3, and 5).
However, the aggravating effect of CRF on both adhesion
and execution in patient 1 should also be taken into account.
The wide spectrum in the severity of defective aggregation
may result from different mutations, which have yet to be
defined, in the affected children.
Secretion depends upon active ATP production,30 and
abnormal platelet aggregation has been reported in disorders
with abnormal glucose metabolism.31 32 The ADP/ATP content
of DGs was reported to be both normal21 28 and low23 in
execution defects, including aspirin-like platelet defects.
Subnormal degradation of metabolic ATP into its metabolites
inosine monophosphate and hypoxanthine was reported in
aggregation defects (including all phases of induction,
transmission, and execution) in leukaemia,23 unlike d-SPD.33
We did not have the opportunity to measure ATP or its
metabolites. However, the predominance of full DGs (type 1) in
our patients, unlike that seen in d-SPD, and the low numbers of
semi-empty DGs (type 2), seem to exclude insufficiency of
adenine nucleotide content and impaired ATP transport across
the granule membrane in platelets from our patients.3 In our
patients’ platelets, intracellular cystine accumulation may
reduce ATP production by impairing oxidative phosphorylation,
and may also reduce both intracellular phosphate and calcium
concentrations, just as it does in the kidney cells of patients with
NC.7 34 If this were the case, adequate messenger molecules
would not be generated after interaction of agonists with their
receptors, so that contractile mechanisms, centralisation of
granules, and release would be partially or completely blocked.
The dilated open canalicular system seen in disorders with
execution defects17 21 23 may reflect ineffective reception and
transmission of release inducing stimuli and thereby may
impair the release mechanism more. Inadequate evacuation
may be aggravated by the residual material, which may
increase after each secretion attempt.
To our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate
raised intraplatelet cystine, abnormal platelet ultrastructure,
and an aggregation defect in NC. We suggest that platelets
should be added to the list of cells in which cystine
accumulates and compromises cellular function, and that
cystinosis should be added to the disorders that give rise to
aggregation defects involving mainly the transmission and
execution phases. We think that patients with NC, even if
they have a normal bleeding screening assessment, might be
at increased risk for bleeding during surgical intervention or
traumatic accidents, particularly if they have CRF.
