Metastasis involves critical interactions between cancer and stromal cells. Intratumoral hypoxia promotes 
metastasis through activation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). We demonstrate that HIFs mediate para￾crine signaling between breast cancer cells (BCCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to promote metastasis. 
In a mouse orthotopic implantation model, MSCs were recruited to primary breast tumors and promoted 
BCC metastasis to LNs and lungs in a HIF-dependent manner. Coculture of MSCs with BCCs augmented 
HIF activity in BCCs. Additionally, coculture induced expression of the chemokine CXCL10 in MSCs and 
the cognate receptor CXCR3 in BCCs, which was augmented by hypoxia. CXCR3 expression was blocked in 
cocultures treated with neutralizing antibody against CXCL10. Conversely, CXCL10 expression was blocked in 
MSCs cocultured with BCCs that did not express CXCR3 or HIFs. MSC coculture did not enhance the metas￾tasis of HIF-deficient BCCs. BCCs and MSCs expressed placental growth factor (PGF) and its cognate receptor 
VEGFR1, respectively, in a HIF-dependent manner, and CXCL10 expression by MSCs was dependent on PGF 
expression by BCCs. PGF promoted metastasis of BCCs and also facilitated homing of MSCs to tumors. Thus, 
HIFs mediate complex and bidirectional paracrine signaling between BCCs and MSCs that stimulates breast 
cancer metastasis.
Introduction
An important advance in cancer biology has been the apprecia￾tion that, in addition to somatic mutations in oncogenes and 
tumor suppressor genes within cancer cells, a major mechanism 
driving disease progression is the interaction of cancer cells with 
the tumor microenvironment. The tumor stroma consists of 
extracellular matrix and various mesenchymal cell types, includ￾ing vascular ECs and pericytes, fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, and 
various cells of bone marrow origin, including tumor-associated 
macrophages, bone marrow–derived angiogenic cells, neutrophils, 
mast cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and mesenchymal 
stem cells (MSCs), which are recruited to the tumor and enhance 
primary tumor growth and/or promote metastasis (1). The molec￾ular mechanisms by which stromal cells are attracted to, and com￾municate with, cancer cells are only understood in a limited num￾ber of contexts. For example, breast cancer cell (BCC) production 
of colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) induces homing of CSF1 
receptor–expressing tumor-associated macrophages that secrete 
epidermal growth factor, which binds to its receptor on cancer 
cells and stimulates their invasive properties (2, 3).
The combination of cancer cell proliferation and stromal cell 
recruitment results in an imbalance between O2 consumption and 
delivery. Tumor vasculature is structurally and functionally abnor￾mal, leading to spatial and temporal heterogeneity in perfusion, 
even in tumors with active angiogenesis (4, 5). As a result, tis￾sue oxygenation is markedly decreased in the tumor microen￾vironment. The mean partial O2 pressure in breast cancers is 
28 mmHg, compared with 65 mmHg in normal breast tissue (6). 
As in the case of stromal cells, hypoxia is a critical feature of the 
tumor microenvironment that promotes invasion and metastasis 
(7–9). O2 deprivation increases the activity of hypoxia-inducible 
factors (HIFs) in both BCCs and stromal cells (10–12). HIFs are 
heterodimeric transcription factors composed of an O2-regulated 
HIF-1α or HIF-2α subunit and a constitutively expressed HIF-1β
subunit (13). Increased levels of HIF-1α or HIF-2α in breast can￾cer biopsies are associated with metastasis to regional LNs and 
distant organs and with patient mortality (14–19). HIFs mediate 
tumor vascularization through the production by cancer cells of 
angiogenic factors that stimulate ECs and mobilize bone marrow–
derived angiogenic cells (20–22). Using both genetic and phar￾macologic loss-of-function approaches, HIFs have been shown 
to play critical roles in breast cancer metastasis to the lungs by 
activating in BCCs the transcription of genes encoding proteins 
that play critical roles in establishment of the metastatic niche and 
in extravasation of BCCs from pulmonary blood vessels (23–28). 
Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with digoxin or acriflavine, 
drugs that inhibit HIF activity, resulted in a dramatic reduction 
in lung metastasis (22, 23). These studies were performed with 
human cell lines derived from triple-negative breast cancers, which 
lack expression of estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors and 
do not respond well to currently available therapies (29).

MSCs are recruited to breast cancers by mechanisms that are not 
well understood (30, 31). When MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-435 
human BCCs (referred to herein as MDA-231 and MDA-435, 
respectively) were mixed with human MSCs and injected subcuta￾neously into immunodeficient mice, the rate of lung metastasis was 
increased compared with injection of BCCs alone; this was attrib￾uted to MSC production of the chemokine CCL5, which bound 
to its cognate receptor, CCR5, on BCCs (31). Although these were 
intriguing observations, the study had several limitations, includ￾ing the involvement of a heterologous microenvironment (subcu￾taneous rather than mammary), the large number of MSCs injected 
(3-fold greater than the number of cancer cells), the long lag time 
to metastasis (up to 150 days), and the use of CCL5 overexpression 
in BCCs to implicate this signaling pathway in metastasis. Among 
the questions raised by the study were the following: What is the 
mechanism by which MSCs are recruited to primary breast tumors? 
Do recruited MSCs produce other chemokines that are important 
for stimulating BCC metastasis? Do BCCs express secreted factors 
that stimulate MSCs to produce chemokines? What are the molec￾ular mechanisms by which MSC-BCC interaction leads to increased 
metastasis? Does intratumoral hypoxia modulate this process? To 
address these issues, we used an orthotopic transplantation model 
involving injection of cocultured human BCCs and MSCs into the 
mammary fat pad (MFP) of SCID mice, which results in spontane￾ous LN and lung metastases within 1 month. Our findings revealed 
complex bidirectional signaling between MSCs and BCCs that was 
stimulated by hypoxia in a HIF-dependent manner and promoted 
metastasis to the LNs as well as the lungs.
Results
Recruitment of MSCs to the primary tumor is HIF dependent, and MSCs 
enhance metastasis of BCCs to lungs and LNs. MSCs exhibit homing 
to sites of tissue injury and tumor growth (31–33). To deter￾mine whether HIF activity in the hypoxic tumor microenviron￾ment facilitates recruitment of MSCs to the primary tumor site, 
MDA-231 human triple-negative BCCs (34) were implanted in 
the MFP of SCID mice. When the tumors had grown to 200 mm3, 
the mice received daily intraperitoneal injections of either saline 
or digoxin (2 mg/kg) to inhibit HIF activity (27, 28, 35). After 
1 week of digoxin treatment, CMFDA-labeled human MSCs were 
injected via tail vein, and primary tumors were harvested 16 hours 
later. The recruitment of MSCs (derived from a male donor) to 
the primary tumor (derived from a female donor) was examined 
by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis of genomic DNA 
using SRY gene primers (to detect Y chromosome sequences) and 
by FACS analysis of fluorescently labeled MSCs in cell suspensions 
prepared from primary tumors. Frozen tumor sections were also 
analyzed for the presence of fluorescently labeled MSCs. All 3 of 
these assays revealed significantly decreased recruitment of MSCs 
in tumors from digoxin- versus saline-treated mice (Figure 1, A–C).
To investigate the functional consequences of interaction between 
MSCs and BCCs, we cocultured MSCs with MDA-231 BCCs at a 
1:1 ratio for 48 hours, followed by MFP implantation of 1 × 106 of 
the cocultured BCCs+MSCs. Controls included mice injected with 
BCCs alone — either the same number of BCCs (0.5 × 106) or the 
same total number of cells (1 × 106). BCCs+MSCs did not accelerate 
growth of the primary tumor (Figure 1D). However, the lungs and 
ipsilateral axillary LNs of mice carrying breast tumors derived from 
BCCs+MSCs displayed a marked increase in metastases (Figure 1, 
E–I). The number of lung foci, as determined by H&E staining, 
and the total lung metastatic burden, as determined by qPCR of 
human-specific HK2 sequences, were significantly increased in 
mice injected with BCCs+MSCs (Figure 1, E–G). The area occupied 
by BCCs in the ipsilateral axillary LN was also increased in mice 
bearing BCCs+MSCs (Figure 1, H and I). In contrast, intravenous 
injection of BCCs+MSCs or MFP coinjection of BCCs and MSCs 
(without prior coculture) did not result in increased lung foci com￾pared with injection of BCCs alone (Supplemental Figure 1; sup￾plemental material available online with this article; doi:10.1172/
JCI64993DS1). These data suggest that coculture of BCCs+MSCs 
increases metastasis by promoting steps prior to BCC entry into the 
circulation, such as tissue invasion or vascular intravasation.
HIFs regulate expression of CXCL10 in MSCs and CXCR3 in BCCs in 
response to coculture and hypoxia. Based on the coculture data, we 
hypothesized that MSCs produce paracrine signals that induce BCCs 
to metastasize. To investigate crosstalk between BCCs and MSCs, an 
array of antibodies directed against various cytokines and chemo￾kines was incubated with conditioned medium (CM) isolated from 
BCCs+MSCs that were cocultured at a 1:1 ratio for 48 hours under 
either nonhypoxic (20% O2) or hypoxic (1% O2) conditions. Levels 
differed between the 2 conditions for 13 of the 33 cytokines and 
chemokines analyzed (Supplemental Figure 2A). We focused on the 
CXCL10 and CCL5 chemokines, which were expressed at higher lev￾els in CM from coculture of BCCs+MSCs under hypoxic conditions.
We analyzed the expression of CXCL10 mRNA by RT-qPCR using 
RNA prepared from coculture of BCCs+MSCs or individually cul￾tured BCCs and MSCs under nonhypoxic or hypoxic conditions. 
CXCL10 expression was induced in the cocultures, and this effect 
was further enhanced when the cocultured cells were subjected 
to hypoxia (Figure 2A). Expression of CXCR3, the cognate recep￾tor for CXCL10 (36), was induced by hypoxia in MDA-231 BCCs 
alone. BCCs+MSCs increased CXCR3 expression, which was fur￾ther enhanced when the cocultured cells were subjected to hypoxia 
(Figure 2B). Similarly, coculture and hypoxia increased the expres￾sion of CCL5 and CCR5 (Figure 2, C and D). Our results confirmed 
a previous report that CCL5 expression was induced in coculture 
of BCCs+MSCs (31) and extended those findings by demonstrat￾ing a synergistic effect of hypoxia.
To investigate the role of HIFs in these phenomena, we used a 
previously validated double-knockdown subclone of MDA-231 
stably transfected with vectors encoding shRNAs directed against 
HIF1A and HIF2A (MDA-231–DKD; referred to herein as DKD 
cells) and a control subclone stably transfected with empty vec￾tor (MDA-231–EV; referred to herein as EV cells) (26, 27). Expres￾sion of CXCR3 and CXCL10 mRNA was significantly decreased in 
DKD+MSCs compared with EV+MSCs at both 20% and 1% O2
(Figure 2, E and F). CCL5 and CCR5 mRNA levels were also signifi￾cantly decreased in DKD+MSCs versus EV+MSCs at both 20% and 
1% O2 (Supplemental Figure 2, B and C). Expression of RPL13A
mRNA, which is not HIF regulated, was not changed in DKD cells 
and was not induced by coculture or hypoxia (Supplemental Fig￾ure 2D). In contrast to the effect of MSCs, coculture of MDA-231 
BCCs with human foreskin fibroblasts did not induce increased 
expression of CXCL10 or CXCR3 (Supplemental Figure 2, H and I), 
which indicates that the coculture effect is dependent on selective 
crosstalk between MDA-231 BCCs and MSCs.
To determine the cell types responsible for the production of 
CXCL10 and CXCR3 under coculture conditions, GFP-expressing 
MDA-231 BCCs were cocultured with MSCs for 48 hours under 
nonhypoxic or hypoxic conditions, and FACS was performed using

GFP fluorescence and CD105 immunofluorescence to sort for 
BCCs and MSCs, respectively. RNA was isolated from the sorted 
cells, and RT-qPCR was performed to analyze CXCR3 and CXCL10
expression. The sorting efficiency was demonstrated using GFP 
primers to confirm that GFP mRNA was detected only in the BCC 
population (Supplemental Figure 2E). Analysis of the sorted cells 
revealed that CXCL10 expression was induced in MSCs, whereas 
CXCR3 expression was induced in BCCs (Figure 2, G and H). 
Similarly, induction of CCL5 was observed in MSCs, and CCR5
expression was induced in BCCs (Supplemental Figure 2, F and G). 
Taken together, the results presented in Figure 2 and Supplemental 
Figure 2 indicate that HIF-dependent crosstalk between BCCs and 
MSCs is mediated through the CXCR3-CXCL10 and CCR5-CCL5 
signaling pathways in response to coculture and hypoxia.
Acriflavine blocks hypoxia-induced CXCL10-CXCR3 and CCL5-CCR5 
expression. We next explored whether pharmacological targeting of 
HIF would inhibit coculture-induced gene expression. Acriflavine 
abrogates HIF activity by inhibiting the dimerization of HIF-1α or 
HIF-2α with the HIF-1β subunit (22). BCCs+MSCs were treated 
with vehicle or acriflavine (1 μM) for 48 hours at 20% or 1% O2. The 
effects of coculture and hypoxia on CXCR3-CXCL10 and CCR5-CCL5
expression were significantly inhibited in the acriflavine-treated 
cocultures (Figure 3).
Inhibiting CXCR3 or CXCL10 abrogates CXCR3-CXCL10 crosstalk. We 
generated MDA-231 subclones that were stably transfected with 
vector encoding either of 2 different shRNAs targeting CXCR3
(shCR3-1 and shCR3-3) or a nontargeted control (NTC) shRNA 
(referred to herein as NTC cells). The knockdown efficiency of 
different subclones was determined by Western blotting (Supple￾mental Figure 3A). Expression of CXCR3 and, surprisingly, that of 
CXCL10 was abrogated when the coculture was performed with 
the CXCR3-knockdown MDA-231 cells (Figure 4, A and B). MAP 
kinase signaling correlated with CXCR3 expression and was inhib￾ited when the coculture was performed with CXCR3-knockdown 
MDA-231 cells (Supplemental Figure 3B). We next added neutral￾izing antibody (NAb) against CXCL10 or control IgG to cocultures 
of MSCs with the parental MDA-231 BCCs. Expression of both 
CXCL10 and CXCR3 mRNA was significantly reduced in the pres￾ence of CXCL10 NAb compared with IgG control (Figure 4, C and 
D). The reduction of CXCL10 and CXCR3 mRNA levels caused by 
NAb was reversed when an excess of recombinant CXCL10 was 
added to the culture medium (Supplemental Figure 3, C and D).
Similar findings were observed in MDA-435 cells, another 
triple-negative human BCC line (37), when CXCR3 expression 
was knocked down (using either of 2 different shRNAs) or when 
CXCL10 NAb was added to cocultures with MSCs (Supplemental 
Figure 4, A–D). Taken together, these data indicate that binding of 
CXCL10 to CXCR3 on BCCs induces BCC→MSC signaling that 
leads to increased CXCL10 expression in MSCs. When CXCR3 
activation is blocked by CXCR3 knockdown or CXCL10 NAb, 
bidirectional signaling does not occur.
In contrast to its effects on CXCL10 and CXCR3 mRNA expres￾sion, CXCL10 NAb did not significantly affect the expression of 
CCR5 or CCL5 mRNA in cocultures of MSCs with MDA-231 or

MDA-435 BCCs (Figure 4, E and F, and Supplemental Figure 4, 
E and F). These results indicate that loss of CXCL10-CXCR3 sig￾naling did not impede CCL5-CCR5 signaling.
Hypoxia-induced CXCL10 enhances BCC migration and invasion. 
We assayed CXCL10 levels in CM from BCCs cultured alone or 
from BCCs+MSCs. Whereas CXCL10 levels in the CM were very 
low when BCCs were cultured alone, coculture of EV+MSCs dra￾matically increased CXCL10 levels, which were further increased 
under hypoxic conditions (Figure 5A). CM from DKD+MSCs 
showed decreased CXCL10 levels, which were not induced by 
hypoxia (Figure 5A). Similarly, CXCL10 levels in CM from cocul￾tures of MSCs with CXCR3-knockdown MDA-231 cells were sig￾nificantly decreased and not induced by hypoxia (Figure 5B). The 
increased CXCL10 levels in DKD+MSCs compared with MSCs 
cultured alone suggests that HIF-independent paracrine signal￾ing also contributes to CXCL10 expression.
CXCL10 is a major chemoattractant for activated T lympho￾cytes and natural killer cells (38). We therefore evaluated the effect 
of CXCL10 on the migration and invasion of BCCs. CM from 
BCCs+MSCs at 20% O2 stimulated increased migration and inva￾sion of naive BCCs, and the effect was augmented when CM from 
hypoxic cocultures was used (Figure 5, C and D). This increase in 
migration and invasion was abrogated when CXCL10 NAb was 
added to the CM (Figure 5, C and D). Treatment of control EV and 
NTC subclones with recombinant CXCL10 stimulated invasion 
through Matrigel (tumor-derived extracellular matrix), whereas 
this effect was significantly decreased in DKD and CXCR3-
knockdown (shCR3-1) subclones (Supplemental Figure 5, A and 
B). These data indicate that CXCL10 produced by MSCs stimu￾lates the HIF-dependent migration and invasion of MDA-231 
BCCs bearing the cognate receptor CXCR3.
To identify molecular mechanisms by which coculture of 
BCCs+MSCs may promote metastasis, we analyzed the expres￾sion of prometastatic HIF target genes (21, 22, 39). Expression 
of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) and lysyl oxidase (LOX) 
mRNAs was induced by coculture and hypoxia (Figure 5, E and F), 
whereas coculture did not induce expression of LOX-like 4 
(LOXL4), angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), or L1 cell adhesion mol￾ecule (L1CAM) mRNAs (Supplemental Figure 5, C–E).
Coculture of HIF- or CXCR3-knockdown BCCs with MSCs inhibits metastasis. 
Inhibition of HIF-1α or HIF-2α expression impairs primary breast 
tumor growth and lung metastasis after MFP injection (26, 27). 
To evaluate whether HIF-1α/HIF-2α expression in BCCs is required 
for cocultured MSCs to stimulate metastasis, EV and DKD cells 
were cocultured with MSCs at 20% O2 for 48 hours prior to MFP 
injection. Primary tumor growth was not affected by MSC coculture 
(Figure 6A). The growth rate of tumors derived from DKD cells was 
decreased, as previously reported (27). When tumor volume reached 
1,300 mm3, mice were euthanized to examine metastasis to lungs 
and LNs. EV+MSCs, but not DKD+MSCs, significantly increased 
metastasis to the lungs, as determined by qPCR using human￾specific primers or by counting the number of metastatic foci on 
Figure 3

(C), and CCR5 (D) mRNA levels were analyzed by RT-qPCR (mean ± SEM; n = 3). Levels were normalized to vehicle-treated BCCs at 20% O2.

H&E-stained lung sections (Figure 6, B and C). Human Y chromo￾some sequences were not detectable by qPCR analysis of genomic 
DNA isolated from lungs of mice that received MFP injections of 
BCCs+MSCs, which indicated that MSCs did not colonize the lungs. 
EV+MSCs, but not DKD+MSCs, also increased metastasis to the 
ipsilateral axillary LN, as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry 
using an antibody specific for human vimentin (Figure 6, D and E).
To further investigate the role of CXCR3 in breast cancer patho￾genesis, we orthotopically implanted CXCR3-knockdown BCCs in 
the MFP of SCID mice. Primary tumor growth and metastasis of 
2 independent subclones of CXCR3-knockdown MDA-231 cells 
(shCR3-1 and shCR3-3) were compared with those of NTC cells 
in the absence of MSCs. CXCR3 knockdown in MDA-231 cells did 
not affect growth of the primary tumor (Supplemental Figure 6, A 
and B). However, mice bearing the CXCR3-knockdown MDA-231 
tumors showed a significantly decreased number of metastatic 
foci and total metastatic burden in the lungs compared with mice 
bearing NTC tumors (Supplemental Figure 6, C–E). Ipsilateral 
axillary LNs isolated from mice bearing CXCR3-knockdown breast 
tumors contained a significantly decreased number of cancer cells, 
as assessed by immunohistochemical staining for human vimen￾tin (Supplemental Figure 6, F and G).
Next, we cocultured CXCR3-knockdown or NTC control MDA-231 
cells with MSCs for 48 hours prior to MFP injection. Inhibition 
of CXCR3 expression in BCCs decreased the ability of MSCs to 
enhance BCC metastasis to the lungs and LNs without affecting 
primary tumor growth (Figure 6, F–J). These results indicated that 
CXCR3 promotes vascular and lymphatic metastasis of BCCs, 
which is stimulated by crosstalk between BCCs and MSCs.
Coculture enhances HIF activity. We next analyzed HIF-1α levels 
in EV+MSCs and DKD+MSCs. HIF-1α expression was induced 
in EV+MSCs under nonhypoxic conditions, and was further 
enhanced with hypoxia (Figure 7A). HIF-1α expression was not 
induced in DKD+MSCs at 20% or 1% O2 (Figure 7A). Coculture 
did not induce HIF1A mRNA levels (Supplemental Figure 7). 
Thus, coculture of BCCs+MSCs specifically increased HIF-1α
protein levels under both hypoxic and nonhypoxic conditions.
To test whether coculture of BCCs+MSCs stimulates HIF tran￾scriptional activity, MDA-231 BCCs were cotransfected with 
HIF-dependent reporter plasmid p2.1, which contains a hypoxia

response element (HRE) from the human ENO1 gene upstream of 
SV40 promoter and firefly luciferase (Fluc) coding sequences (40), 
and pSV-Renilla, in which Renilla luciferase (Rluc) expression is 
driven by the SV40 promoter only. The ratio of Fluc/Rluc activity 
is a specific measure of HIF transcriptional activity. Transfected 
cells were cocultured with MSCs and exposed to 20% or 1% O2 for 
48 hours. Coculture significantly increased HIF transcriptional 
activity in EV+MSCs at both 20% and 1% O2 (Figure 7B), consis￾tent with the induction of HIF-1α protein expression (Figure 7A). 
Coculture of DKD+MSCs significantly reduced HIF transcription￾al activity (Figure 7B). In contrast, the effect of coculture on HIF 
transcriptional activity was not lost when CXCR3 expression was 
knocked down in MDA-231 BCCs (Figure 7C). Taken together, 
these results indicate that coculture of BCCs+MSCs enhances HIF 
transcriptional activity in BCCs by a mechanism independent of 
CXCR3 signaling that involves increased HIF-1α protein levels.
CXCR3 is a HIF-1 target gene. Analysis of the human CXCR3 gene 
sequence revealed candidate HREs in the 5′-flanking (HRE-1) and 
3′-untranslated (HRE-2) regions that contained the HIF binding 
site sequence 5′-ACGTG-3′ followed by 5′-CACA-3′ (Figure 8A). 
This bipartite structure was first identified in the human EPO gene 
(41) and subsequently found in other HREs, including those in the 
ALDOA (39), COX4I2 (41), PKM2 (42), and ANGPTL4 (27) genes 
(Supplemental Figure 8). To determine whether HIF-1 binds at 
these sites, ChIP assays were performed in MDA-231 BCCs, which 
demonstrated hypoxia-inducible binding of HIF-1α and HIF-1β to 
both HRE-1 and HRE-2 (Figure 8, B–E). To test whether these puta￾tive HREs are functional, a 60-bp fragment encompassing HRE-1 
or HRE-2 (Figure 8A) was inserted downstream of SV40 promoter 
and Fluc coding sequences in the reporter plasmid pGL2 promoter. 
MDA-231 BCCs were cotransfected with pGL2–CXCR3–HRE-1 or 
pGL2–CXCR3–HRE-2 and pSV-Renilla and exposed to 20% or 1% O2
for 24 hours. Both HRE-1 and HRE-2 significantly increased Fluc 
activity in hypoxic MDA-231 BCCs (Figure 8, F and G). Mutation of 
5′-CGT-3′ to 5′-AAA-3′ (Figure 8A), which eliminates HIF-1 binding 
(40, 41), in HRE-1 or HRE-2 significantly decreased hypoxia-induced 
luciferase activity (Figure 8, F and G). Taken together, the ChIP and 
reporter data indicated that HIF-1 binds to HREs present in the 
5′-flanking and 3′-untranslated regions of the human CXCR3 gene 
and directly activates its transcription under hypoxic conditions.
HIF regulates PGF expression in BCCs and VEGFR1 expression in 
MSCs. The data presented above demonstrate that production 
of the chemokines CXCL10 and CCL5 by MSCs enables them to 
communicate with BCCs, which express the cognate receptors 
CXCR3 and CCR5, respectively. However, the loss of CXCL10 
expression by MSCs when cocultured with BCCs in which CXCR3 
was inhibited suggested that BCCs must also communicate with 
MSCs, i.e., there must be bidirectional signaling. Furthermore, 
the homing of MSCs to tumors demonstrated in Figure 1 is 
likely to involve a secreted factor produced by BCCs that binds 
to a cognate receptor on MSCs. Based on our previous studies of 
VEGFR1 expression in MSCs (43), we hypothesized that BCCs may 
communicate with MSCs by producing placental growth factor 
(PGF), a ligand that binds specifically to VEGFR1. PGF expression 
in breast cancer biopsies is associated with an increased risk of 
metastasis and patient mortality (44). PGF mRNA expression was 
significantly increased in hypoxic MDA-231 BCCs, and VEGFR1
mRNA expression was induced in hypoxic MSCs (Figure 9, A and 
B). Coculture of BCCs+MSCs induced the expression of PGF and 
VEGFR1 mRNA. Expression of PGF and VEGFR1 mRNA was mark￾Figure 6

edly decreased in DKD+MSCs compared with EV+MSCs (Figure 9, 
C and D). Flow sorting of BCCs and MSCs after coculture showed 
that PGF expression was induced in BCCs, and VEGFR1 expression 
was induced in MSCs (Figure 9, E and F).
We assayed secreted PGF levels in CM from BCCs cultured alone or 
from BCCs+MSCs. PGF levels were induced in the hypoxic CM isolat￾ed from MDA-231 or MDA-435 BCCs, which were further increased 
with coculture and hypoxia (Supplemental Figure 9, A and B). 
CM from EV+MSCs had dramatically increased PGF levels, which 
were further increased under hypoxic conditions, whereas PGF levels 
were markedly decreased in CM from DKD+MSCs (Figure 9G).
To determine whether PGF regulates CXCL10→
CXCR3 signaling between MSCs and BCCs, we inhib￾ited PGF expression in MDA-231 BCCs using shRNA. 
The knockdown efficiency of subclones (shPGF-1 
and shPGF-2) was determined by ELISA (Supplemen￾tal Figure 9C). Analysis of PGF-knockdown MDA-231 
cells cocultured with MSCs revealed a complete loss 
of CXCL10 mRNA expression and CXCL10 protein 
secretion (Figure 9H and Supplemental Figure 9D). 
CXCR3 expression was not changed in PGF-knock￾down MDA-231 cells (Supplemental Figure 9E), 
which ruled out the possibility that autocrine effects 
of PGF on BCCs regulate CXCR3 expression.
HIF and PGF expressed by BCCs facilitate MSC migration 
and homing. HIF-1 is required for VEGFR1 expression 
and chemotactic responses to PGF in mouse MSCs 
(43). To study whether PGF secretion from human 
BCCs stimulates the motility of human MSCs, we 
isolated CM from NTC, shPGF-1, and shPGF-2 
MDA-231 subclones. Compared with CM from NTC 
cells, CM from shPGF-1 or shPGF-2 knockdown cells 
induced significantly less MSC migration (Figure 10, 
A and B). Furthermore, CM from hypoxic NTC cells 
markedly increased the chemotactic activity of MSCs, 
whereas CM from hypoxic shPGF-1 or shPGF-2 cells 
had no stimulatory effect.
To determine whether PGF secretion from BCCs 
promotes recruitment of MSCs to the primary 
tumor site, NTC, shPGF-1 knockdown, and shPGF-2 
knockdown MDA-231 cells were implanted in the 
MFP of SCID mice. When the tumors had grown to 
250 mm3, human MSCs were injected via tail vein, 
and primary tumors were harvested 16 hours later. 
Recruitment of MSCs to the primary tumor was 
examined by qPCR analysis of genomic DNA using 
SRY gene primers. The recruitment of MSCs was 
significantly decreased in tumors derived from PGF￾knockdown MDA-231 cells compared with NTC￾derived tumors (Figure 10C).
To study migration in a coculture assay, CMFDA￾labeled MDA-231 BCCs and CMTPX-labeled MSCs 
were cocultured in a LiveAssay 2-chamber device 
coated with fibronectin and allowed to attach over￾night. Time-lapse photomicroscopy (Figure 10D), 
which was performed for 12 hours at 20% or 1% O2, 
revealed that the migration of MSCs and BCCs 
toward each other was significantly increased under 
hypoxic conditions (Figure 10, E–H). Coculture with 
DKD cells or shPGF-1 cells led to decreased migra￾tion of MSCs compared with those cocultured with control 
BCCs (Figure 10, E and G).
PGF is a HIF-1 target gene. Analysis of the human PGF gene 
sequence revealed 2 candidate HIF-1 binding sites in the 5′ flank￾ing region. In PGF, HRE-1 and HRE-2 are located 200 and 2,000 bp 
upstream of the transcription start site, respectively (Figure 11A). 
To determine whether HIF-1 binds to these sites, ChIP assays 
were performed in MDA-231 BCCs, which demonstrated hypox￾ia-inducible binding of HIF-1α and HIF-1β to both HRE-1 and 
HRE-2 (Figure 11, B–E), providing evidence for direct regulation 
of PGF gene transcription by HIF-1. To test whether these putative

reporter data indicated that HIF-1 binds to HREs present in the 
5′-flanking region of the human PGF gene and directly activates 
its transcription under hypoxic conditions.
PGF promotes the metastasis of breast cancer cells. To further inves￾tigate the role of PGF in breast cancer pathogenesis, PGF-knock￾down BCCs were orthotopically implanted in the MFP of SCID 
mice. Primary tumor growth and metastasis of the independent

Discussion
In this study, we demonstrated that HIFs are 
critical regulators of remarkably complex bidi￾rectional MSC-BCC interactions that promote 
breast cancer metastasis (Figure 13). Interac￾tions between BCCs and MSCs were medi￾ated by CXCL10→CXCR3, CCL5→CCR5, and 
PGF→VEGFR1 signaling, which was further 
augmented by at least 4 feed-forward loops, in 
which (a) PGF production by BCCs induced 
expression of CXCL10 by MSCs; (b) CXCL10 
secretion by MSCs stimulated CXCR3 expres￾sion by BCCs; (c) CXCR3 activity in BCCs stimu￾lated CXCL10 expression in MSCs; and (d) MSCs 
stimulated HIF-1α expression and HIF transcrip￾tional activity in BCCs through a CXCR3-inde￾pendent mechanism. Finally, we demonstrated 
that hypoxia augmented all of these signaling 
pathways in a HIF-dependent manner. Our data 
establish CXCR3 and PGF as direct HIF-1 target 
genes in BCCs, and we have previously demon￾strated that VEGFR1 is a direct HIF-1 target gene 
in MSCs (43). CXCR3 expression has been previ￾ously associated with decreased overall survival 
in breast cancer patients and shown to promote 
lung metastasis in mice (45).
Although our study was inspired by the work 
of other investigators who first demonstrated 
a prometastatic effect of MSCs on BCCs via 
CCL5→CCR5 signaling (31), we modified the 
experimental approach and advanced our under￾standing of the mechanisms and consequences 
of MSC-BCC interaction in several important 
aspects. First, MFP injection was performed so 
that BCCs and MSCs were placed in the breast 
rather than in a heterologous (subcutaneous) 
microenvironment. Second, the MSC/BCC ratio 
was decreased from 3:1 to 1:1, which may bet￾ter model the cellular composition of human 
breast cancers. Third, coculture of BCCs+MSCs 
was performed for 48 hours prior to MFP injec￾tion in order to activate bidirectional signaling; 
moreover, in our model, there was no prometa￾static effect of coinjected MSCs in the absence of 
prior coculture. Fourth, we found that MSC-BCC 
interaction promoted metastasis via lymphatic 
and vascular routes to the regional LNs and 
lungs, respectively. Fifth, we observed that HIF 
regulated CXCL10→CXCR3 and PGF→VEGFR1 
signaling, as well as the previously reported CCL5→CCR5 signal￾ing (31), between MSCs and BCCs. Finally, we established the exis￾tence of bidirectional signaling as well as a potential mechanism 
for the homing of MSCs to the primary tumor (i.e., HIF-dependent 
PGF expression by hypoxic BCCs).
We have recently demonstrated that hypoxia promotes the 
metastasis of BCCs to the lungs through the HIF-dependent 
expression of (a) L1CAM, a cell adhesion molecule that mediates 
BCC-EC interactions and thereby induces the margination of cir￾culating BCCs in the pulmonary vasculature (27); (b) ANGPTL4, 
a secreted protein that inhibits EC-EC interactions and thereby 
those of NTC control cells. PGF knockdown in MDA-231 BCCs 
modestly inhibited growth of the primary tumor (Figure 12, A 
and B). However, mice bearing the PGF-knockdown MDA-231 
tumors showed a significantly decreased number of metastatic 
foci and total metastatic burden in the lungs compared with 
NTC tumor–bearing mice (Figure 12, C–E). Ipsilateral axillary 
LNs isolated from mice bearing PGF-knockdown breast tumors 
contained a significantly decreased number of cancer cells, as 
assessed by immunohistochemical staining for human vimentin 
(Figure 12, F and G). Thus, PGF plays a significant role in pro￾moting breast cancer metastasis.

facilitates BCC extravasation through 
the vascular endothelium into the 
lung parenchyma (27); and (c) LOX 
and LOXL4, secreted enzymes that 
mediate collagen crosslinking in the 
lungs of tumor-bearing mice and 
thereby initiate metastatic niche for￾mation (26, 28). Coculture of MSCs 
with MDA-231 BCCs augmented the 
hypoxia-induced expression of LOX
mRNA, whereas ANGPTL4, L1CAM, 
and LOXL4 mRNA expression was 
not affected. HIF-dependent expres￾sion of the matrix metalloproteases 
MMP2, MMP9, and MMP14 has been 
reported (46–48), and coculture of 
BCCs+MSCs augmented the hypoxia￾induced expression of MMP9, but not 
MMP2 or MMP14. Induction of LOX
and MMP9 expression was consistent 
with the increased invasive properties 
of BCCs subjected to coculture and/or 
hypoxia. These results provide specific 
molecular mechanisms by which MSC 
coculture may promote BCC metasta￾sis, which appears to involve activation 
of only a subset of HIF target genes. 
Further studies are required to estab￾lish the mechanism that accounts for 
this surprising selectivity.
We demonstrated that intravenous 
injection of BCCs+MSCs did not result 
in increased lung colonization, com￾pared with injection of BCCs only. 
This result was consistent with our 
finding that coculture of BCCs+MSCs 
increased the expression of genes 
encoding proteins (e.g., LOX and 
MMP9) that promote metastasis by 
mediating tissue invasion and premet￾astatic niche formation, which involve 
processes that occur in the primary 
tumor and are therefore not assayed by 
intravenous injection of cells. In con￾trast, the expression of ANGPTL4 and 
L1CAM, which are HIF-regulated genes 
that promote extravasation of circulat￾ing BCCs into the lung parenchyma 
(27), was not induced by coculture with 
MSCs. Thus, our molecular data are 
consistent with the finding that cocul￾ture selectively induces the expression 
of gene products that mediate steps 
in the metastatic process that are not 
interrogated by analysis of lung coloni￾zation after intravenous injection.
We recently reported that treatment 
of mice with the HIF inhibitors digoxin

at 37°C in a modular incubator chamber (Billups-Rothenberg) flushed 
with a gas mixture containing 1% O2, 5% CO2, and 94% N2.
Coculture experiments. Equal numbers of MSCs and MDA-231 or MDA￾435 BCCs were seeded in a 1:1 ratio of DMEM with 10% FBS/αMEM 
with 20% FBS.
RT-qPCR. Total RNA was extracted from cells and tissue using TRIzol
(Invitrogen) and treated with DNase I (Ambion). 1 μg total RNA was used for 
first-strand DNA synthesis using iScript cDNA Synthesis system (BioRad), 
and qPCR was performed using human-specific primers and SYBR Green 
qPCR Master Mix (Fermentas). For each primer pair, annealing tem￾perature was optimized by gradient PCR. The expression of each target 
mRNA relative to 18S rRNA was calculated based on Ct as 2–Δ(ΔCt), in which 
ΔCt = Cttarget – Ct18S and Δ(ΔCt) = ΔCtsample – ΔCtcontrol (22). See Supplemen￾tal Table 1 for primer sequences.
Immunoblot assays. Whole cell lysates were prepared in RIPA lysis buffer. 
Blots were probed with HIF-1α (Novus Biologicals), CXCR3 (R&D), pERK 
(Santa Cruz), and ERK (Santa Cruz) antibodies. HRP-conjugated anti-rab￾bit (Roche) and anti-mouse (Santa Cruz) secondary antibodies were used. 
Signal was detected using ECL Plus (GE Healthcare). Blots were reprobed 
with a polyclonal anti-actin antibody (Santa Cruz).
Animal studies. Female 5- to 7-week-old SCID mice (NCI) were studied. 
Digoxin and saline for injection were obtained from the research pharma￾cy of the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Cells were harvested by trypsinization, 
washed in PBS, resuspended at 107 cells/ml in a 1:1 solution of PBS/Matri￾gel, and injected directly into the MFP. Primary tumors were measured in 
3 dimensions (a, b, c), and volume was calculated as abc × 0.52. Primary 
tumors were harvested from the mammary gland. Lungs were perfused 
with PBS. One lung was inflated for formalin fixation and paraffin embed￾ding, and the other was used to isolate genomic DNA (22).
Extraction of genomic Dna. Lungs were digested with lysis buffer and 
proteinase K at 55°C, and genomic DNA was extracted with phenol￾chloroform, precipitated with isopropanol, and washed with ethanol. 200 ng 
genomic DNA was used for qPCR to quantify human HK2 and mouse 18S
rRNA gene sequences (22).
MSC recruitment assay. 2 × 106 MDA-231 BCCs were injected into the 
MFP. When the tumor reached 200 mm3, the mouse received daily 
intraperitoneal injections of saline or digoxin (2 mg/kg) for 1 week. 
MSCs were labeled by 30-minute exposure to 1 μM CMFDA (Invitrogen), 
0.5 × 106 MSCs were injected intravenously, and the primary tumor was 
harvested after 16 hours. The primary tumor was halved for FACS analysis 
of labeled MSCs and for qPCR analysis of SRY copy number.
CXCL10 and PGF ELISA. CXCL10 and PGF protein levels in CM were 
determined using ELISA kits (R&D Systems) according to the manufac￾turer’s protocol.
MDA-231 and MDA-435 triple-negative BCCs from breast to lung 
(27, 28). Our findings that digoxin treatment blocked the homing 
of MSCs to the primary breast tumor and that acriflavine blocked 
coculture-induced CXCL10-CXCR3 and CCL5-CCR5 expression 
suggest that inhibition of MSC-BCC interaction represents yet 
another mechanism by which HIF inhibitors prevent breast can￾cer metastasis and underscore the need for clinical trials of these 
drugs in women with breast cancer.
Methods
Vectors and cell culture. Oligonucleotides encoding shRNA targeting HIF2A
mRNA (nucleotides 1,992–2,012; GenBank NM_001430) or HIF1A mRNA 
(nucleotides 2,123–2,141; GenBank NM_181054) were inserted in place 
of the DNA sequence encoding shRNA against luciferase in lentiviral 
vector pRRL-LucshRNA-GFP. pLKO.1-puro lentiviral vectors encoding 
shRNA targeting CXCR3 mRNA (clone NM_001504) or PGF mRNA (clone 
NM_002632) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The pLKO.1-puro 
recombinant vectors were cotransfected with plasmid pCMV-dR8.91 and 
plasmid encoding vesicular stomatitis virus G protein into 293T cells 
using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Viral supernatant was col￾lected 48 hours after transfection, filtered (0.45-μm pore size), and added 
to MDA-231 or MDA-435 BCCs in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene 
(Sigma-Aldrich). Puromycin (0.5 μg/ml) was added to the medium of cells 
transduced with pLKO.1-puro vectors for selection.
MDA-231 and MDA-435 BCCs were maintained in high-glucose 
(4.5 mg/ml) DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. CXCR3
and PGF knockdown subclones were maintained in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml 
puromycin. Human bone marrow–derived MSCs (49) were obtained from 
the Tulane Center for Gene Therapy. MSCs were maintained in αMEM 
(Gibco; Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% FBS (Atlanta Biologicals) and 
1% penicillin/streptomycin (Cellgro). Cells were maintained at 37°C in a 
5% CO2, 95% air incubator (20% O2). Hypoxic cells (1% O2) were maintained 
Figure 13
Bidirectional signaling between BCCs and MSCs. Hypoxia induces 
recruitment of bone marrow–derived MSCs to the primary tumor 
site. MSC-BCC interaction induces CXCL10, CCL5, and VEGFR1 
expression in MSCs and CXCR3, CCR5, and PGF expression in 
BCCs. MSC→BCC interaction is mediated by CCL5→CCR5 and 
CXCL10→CXCR3 signaling. BCC→MSC interaction is mediated by 
PGF→VEGFR1 signaling, which induces CXCL10 expression in MSCs 
and thereby establishes a positive feedback loop between the 2 cell 
types. The PGF→VEGFR1 interaction is important for MSC homing, 
and CXCL10→CXCR3 and CCL5→CCR5 signaling promote BCC 
metastasis. The consequence of these interactions is the expression of 
genes that enhance invasion and the metastasis of BCCs to the lungs 
and LNs. The expression of CXCR3 and PGF (and probably CCR5) in 
BCCs as well as VEGFR1 (and perhaps CXCL10 and CCL5) in MSCs 
are regulated by HIFs.

Luciferase reporter assays. MDA-231 BCCs were cotransfected with pGL2 
promoter reporter containing WT or mutant HRE or pSV-Renilla. Lucif￾erase activities were determined using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter 
System (Promega).
Time-lapse photomicroscopy. MDA-231 BCCs were labeled with CellTrack￾er Green CMFDA, and MSCs were labeled with CellTracker Red CMTPX 
(Invitrogen). The labeled cells were cocultured in a LiveAssay 2-chamber 
device coated with fibronectin (50 μg/ml) and allowed to attach overnight. 
After monolayers formed in each chamber, the middle wall was removed, 
and time-lapse photomicroscopy was performed with a Zeiss Axiovert 
2000 phase-contrast microscope using ×20 apochromat objective lens with 
NA 1.4. Images were acquired using a Cascade 512BII camera (Roper 
Scientific) and processed using Slidebook 4.2.0 (Intelligent Imaging Innova￾tions). Image analysis was performed by semiautomatic routine, written in 
MATLAB 2009 (Mathworks). Cell migration over time was calculated for 
both cell types. For each condition, the longest cell projection for each cell 
type was calculated manually using Image J (NIH).
Statistics. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Differences between 2 groups 
and multiple groups were analyzed by 2-tailed Student’s t test and 1-way 
ANOVA, respectively. A P value less than 0.05 was considered significant.
Study approval. Animal protocols were in accordance with the NIH Guide 
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Johns 
Hopkins University Animal Care and Use Committee.

Chemokine array. The levels of different chemokines in the CM were 
evaluated using a chemokine array (R&D Systems) according to the man￾ufacturer’s protocol.
Migration assay. BCCs were seeded onto uncoated filters in a 24-well Transwell 
chamber (8-mm pore size; Costar) and allowed to migrate for 8 hours 
in the presence or absence of CXCL10 and CXCL10 NAb. The cells that 
migrated to the underside of the filter were stained with crystal violet and 
counted under brightfield microscopy.
Invasion assay. BCCs were seeded onto filters of a 24-well Transwell chamber 
that were coated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences). Invasion of the cells through 
the Matrigel to the underside of the filter was assessed 24 hours later by stain￾ing with crystal violet and counting under brightfield microscopy.
Analysis of LN metastasis. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed 
on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded LNs. Sections (4 μm thick) were 
deparaffinized and rehydrated, antigens were retrieved using citrate buf￾fer, and staining was performed using an antibody that specifically rec￾ognizes human vimentin (Santa Cruz) and analyzed by Image J software 
(NIH). The acquired images in RGB color were separated in different color 
channels by a color deconvolution method (50). The Image J plugin for 
color deconvolution has a built-in vector for separating hematoxylin and 
diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining. After color deconvolution, hematoxy￾lin and DAB images were processed separately. By using 5 random test 
samples stained for vimentin, suitable threshold levels for hematoxylin 
and DAB were determined. These thresholds were used on both hema￾toxylin and DAB images and kept constant for analysis of the main image 
dataset. The extent of staining was calculated as the DAB-positive area 
divided by the hematoxylin-positive area.
ChIP assays. MDA-231 BCCs were crosslinked with formaldehyde and 
lysed with SDS lysis buffer. Chromatin was sheared by sonication, and 
lysates were precleared with salmon sperm DNA/protein A agarose slurry 
(Millipore) and incubated with immunoprecipitating antibodies against 
HIF-1α (Santa Cruz), HIF-1β, and IgG (provided by K. Padgett, Novus 
Biologicals, Littleton, Colorado, USA). Salmon sperm DNA/protein A 
agarose slurry was added, and the agarose beads were washed sequentially 
with low- and high-salt wash buffers (0.1% SDS; 1% Triton X-100; 2 mM 
EDTA; and 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0; with 0.15 M and 0.5 M NaCl, respectively), 
LiCl wash buffer (0.25 M LiCl; 1% NP-40; 1% deoxycholate; 10 mM Tris, 
pH 8.0; and 1 mM EDTA), and TE buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and 1 mM 
EDTA). DNA was eluted in 1% SDS with 0.1 M NaHCO3, and crosslinks 
were reversed by addition of 0.2 M NaCl. DNA was purified using phenol￾chloroform extraction method, suspended in 30 μl TE buffer, and a 2-μl 
aliquot was used for qPCR.
