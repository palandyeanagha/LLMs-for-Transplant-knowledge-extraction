Abstract
Hepatitis C virus (HCV), first recognized as a cause of transfusion-associated acute and chronic hepatitis in 1989,
plays a major role as a cause of chronic liver injury, with potential for neoplastic degeneration. It is mainly
transmitted by the parenteral route. However, although with lower efficiency, it may be also transmitted by sexual
intercourses and by the mother-to-child route. Epidemiological evidence shows that a wave of infection occurred
in the 1945-65 period (baby boomers) in western countries. After acute infection, as many as 50-85% of the
patients fail to clear the virus resulting in chronic liver infection and/or disease. It is estimated that, on a global
scale, about 170 million people are chronically infected with HCV, leading to about 350.000 deaths yearly. Among
western countries southern Europe, and particularly Italy, is among the most affected areas. The impact on the
public health systems is noteworthy, with high number of hospitalizations due to chronic liver disease, cirrhosis or
hepatocellular carcinoma. While waiting for a safe and effective vaccine to be made available, new promising
direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs offer a better therapeutic scenario than in the past even for the poor responder
genotypes 1 and 4, provided that effective screening and care is offered. However, the long and aspecific
prodromic period before clinical symptoms develop is a major obstacle to early detection and treatment. Effective
screening strategies may target at-risk groups or age specific groups, as recently recommended by the CDC.
Introduction
The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a RNA virus belonging to
the Flaviviridae family. It has been first recognized as a
cause of transfusion-associated acute and chronic hepatitis
(formerly known as non-A, non-B hepatitis) in 1989 [1].
Six different genotypes (HCV-1 to HCV-6) and several
subtypes have subsequently been identified, with different
geographical and virulence patterns and different response
to conventional therapy. Its epidemiological relevance as a
cause of chronic liver injury, with potential for neoplastic
degeneration, has since been fully appreciated. At present,
it is estimated that about 170 million people, roughly 3%
of the world population, are chronically infected with
HCV leading to about 350.000 deaths yearly, related to
complications such as cirrhosis and liver cancer [2].
During the last 2 decades, an increasing body of knowl￾edge has accumulated as to its virological properties,
modes of transmission, epidemiological characteristics,
pathogenesis, clinical features and public health impact.
While waiting for a safe and effective vaccine to be made
available, new promising direct-acting antiviral (DAA)
drugs offer a better therapeutic scenario than in the past
even for the poor responder genotypes 1 and 4.
Transmission routes and epidemiology
Similarly to other parenterally-transmitted infections
such as HIV and HBV, other various modalities of HCV
transmission have been documented:
- Intravenous drug use. Since the most efficient trans￾mission route of hepatitis C virus is percutaneous expo￾sure, it is not surprising that intravenous needle sharing

as 90% when HIV co-infected drug addicts are considered
[3].
- Non-intravenous recreational drug exposure. Increas￾ing evidence is accumulating that HCV may also cross
the nasal mucosa and infect subjects chronically using
inhalatory recreational drugs, such as cocaine, by the
sharing of inhalatory instrumentation, favored by the
frequent bleeding of the nasal mucosa occurring in
these individuals [4].
- Accidental exposure. The risk of HCV infection after
accidental needle stick exposure has been reported to
range between 0.2% to 10%, depending on various factors
including hollow-bore needles, percutaneous exposure,
high HCV viral load or HIV co-infection of the index
case [5].
- Healthcare procedures. Exposure to unsafe healthcare
practice, including hemodyalisis, has been reported to be
one of the most important risk factors associated with
HCV infection, even in western countries [6,7].
- Mother to child vertical transmission. Mother-to-child
vertical transmission of HCV is reported to occur in
3-10% of cases, mostly in the late intrauterine period, at
delivery or in the peri-natal period. Many factors have
been reported to influence the transmission rate, including
maternal high viral load, labour duration, newborn gender,
premature membrane rupture and genotype [8]. The role
of elective cesarean section to reduce mother-to-child
transmission rates is debated and controversial [8,9] and
the guidelines of the European Association for the Study
of the Liver (EASL) does not recommend cesarean section
to prevent HCV vertical transmission [10].
- Sexual exposure. The efficiency of the sexual transmis￾sion of HCV has been the subject of extensive debate and
it is generally considered to be very low [11]. However,
among male intravenous drug users, the rate of HCV
infection was found to be one third higher in those who
had sex with men (MSM) than in heterosexuals [12].
Recent evidence points to the increasing incidence of
HCV infections in MSM, probably facilitated by rectal
mucosa traumatisms, especially when HIV-infection co￾exists. Paradoxically, it has been noted that the increased
incidence of the sexual transmission of HCV has paralleled
the increased availability of Highly Active Anti-retroviral
Therapy (HAART), suggesting that a false-security feeling
may have played a role [13].
However, for a large share of cases, estimated at around
30%, no definite exposure source may be identified.
Studies of age-specific prevalence rates of anti-HCV in
the population show that HCV infection is rare among
children while it increases with age, suggesting a possible
cohort effect in anti-HCV positive elderly individuals
who acquired the infection several years ago, before the
introduction of effective preventive measures such as
screening of donors and use of disposable needles and
syringes in medical practice. During the last 10 years, the
rate of transfusion-associated hepatitis C has significantly
dropped as a consequence of the introduction of increas￾ing restrictions on donor eligibility and the implementa￾tion of effective anti-HCV or HCV-RNA screening.
Consequently, most of the millions who are chronically
infected with HCV are now in the fourth or fifth decade
of life (“baby boomers”). As they move into their 60s and
70s, these individuals constitute a wave of asymptomatic
HCV infection that may move toward clinical disease.
Whatever the transmission route, it is estimated that
approximately 170 million individuals, i.e. 3% of the
world population, are chronically infected with HCV
[14]. HCV is the primary cause of death of 350,000 indi￾viduals every year, also representing the primary reason
for liver transplantation.
The prevalence varies markedly from low (< 2.5%) in
North America, Europe, Australia and Far East, to inter￾mediate (2.5% to 10%) in some Mediterranean countries,
South America, Africa and Middle East to high (>10%)
prevalence areas in Egypt, Burundi, Gabon, Cameroon,
Rwanda, Guinea, Bolivia, Mongolia with an steady North￾South increasing trend. It has been estimated that in
Southern Europe 9 million persons are anti-HCV positive,
1,600,000 of whom in Italy, and that HCV accounts for
approximately 20% of reported cases of acute hepatitis. Six
genotypes, numbered 1-6, and a large number of subtypes
have been described. Genotype 1 (subtype 1a and 1b) is by
far the most prevalent genotype worldwide. A number of
studies have reported that subtypes 1a and 1b predomi￾nates in America and Europe, and that subtype 1b is the
predominant genotype in Asia. Both types 2 and 3 are
found with significant prevalence in many countries in
North and South America, Europe and Asia. Others stu￾dies have found type 4 to be predominant in Africa. How￾ever, HCV type 4 and 5 can also be found sporadically
outside of Africa.
Natural history and clinical impact
After HCV acute infection an average 50-85% of patients
will not clear the virus, with higher rates in HIV-co￾infected subjects, and will therefore remain chronically
infected with plateau or fluctuating viremia detectable in
the blood. The remaining 15-50% will gradually show a
decrease and final disappearance of the virus from the
blood, usually within 3 months from infection [15,16]. The
complex mechanisms regulating virus clearance and per￾sistence are still not completed understood, but probably
imply both host and virus factors. The role of ethnicity has
not been proved. On the contrary, sexual transmission of
HCV and HBV co-infection might favor viral clearance,
probably due to limited inoculum and viral interference,
respectively [17]. From the virological perspective, the
higher the genetic diversity of the infecting virus, the
Zaltron et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2012, 12(Suppl 2):S2

higher the probability that the immune response will not
be able to control its replication, resulting in chronic infec￾tion, while a narrow quasispecies spectrum is more likely
associated to viral clearance [18]. Of note, similar to hepa￾titis B infection but without genomic integration, it has
been recently demonstrated that HCV may replicate in the
liver in the absence of detectable viral level in the blood , a
condition sometimes referred to as “occult C hepatitis”,
with lower potential for progressive disease [19].
In the setting of persistent hepatitis C viremia, liver
fibrosis is the consequence of chronic inflammation
leading to the final distortion of hepatic architecture
and impairment of liver microcirculation and cell func￾tions. The main consequence of chronic HCV infection
is the progression to cirrhosis, often clinically silent
apart from non-specific symptoms such as fatigue,
upper right quadrant pain or, sometimes, arthralgia and
myalgia, until severe complications develop.
In most cases, abnormal ALT values are the only clini￾cal aspecific findings of the disease, only representing a
marker of hepatocellular dysfunction. In particular, a
direct correlation between the degree of ALT elevation
and stage of the HCV-related disease is often lacking as a
significant cytolytic activity is not a surrogate marker of
disease severity [20] as well as normal ALT does not
always mean an healthy liver. Population-based studies
indicate that up to 30%-40% of individuals with chronic
HCV have persistently normal ALT values when serially
tested. However, significant liver disease, with active
inflammation and/or at least significant fibrosis, is
biopsy-proven in about 20% of HCV carriers with normal
ALT [21].
Chronic hepatitis C is the most common cause of cir￾rhosis and the most common indication for liver trans￾plantation in Europe, North and South America, Australia
and Japan. The risk of developing cirrhosis ranges from
5% to 25% over periods of 25-30 years [22].
Environmental and host factors can increase the risk
and/or accelerate the natural course of HCV-related dis￾ease. Multiple studies have shown that alcohol consump￾tion, in particular a daily intake greater than 40-50 g, is
one of the most influential factor driving fibrosis progres￾sion in patients with HCV. Age at time of infection also
plays a role: the estimated probability of progression is sig￾nificantly higher in patients that were infected at an older
age (> 40 years) [23]. Also, a recent and large analysis of
published studies suggests that early acquisition of HCV
in childhood is rarely associated to a severe future course
of the disease [24]. Other factors that affect the progres￾sion of hepatic fibrosis include male gender, the degree of
inflammation and fibrosis on the liver biopsy, co-morbid￾ities such as immunosoppression or metabolic condition
such as non-alcholic steatohepatitis, obesity and insulin
resistance [20].
In addition, co-infection with HBV or HIV are signifi￾cant risk factors for liver fibrosis. Approximately 4 to 5
million subjects with chronic hepatitis C are co-infected
with HIV. Highest co-infection rates are observed among
injection drug users (IDU): in the USA and in Europe,
among HIV-infected IDU, HCV prevalence may be as
high as 70-90 %. Paradoxically, the longer life-expectancy
offered to HIV-infected patients by HAART permits slow￾acting HCV-related liver injury to emerge as a significant
cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-HCV co-infected
patients. Furthermore, the progression rate to cirrhosis
and end-stage liver disease is accelerated in HIV co￾infected patients: they have a twofold increased rate of cir￾rhosis compared to HCV mono-infected individuals [25],
particularly when HIV associated immune-depression
progresses.
The mechanisms underlying accelerated liver disease in
HIV-HCV co-infected patients are not completely under￾stood, possibly including direct HCV effects on hepato￾cytes and hepatic stellate cells as well as immunological
alterations such as immune activation, apoptosis and
impaired HCV specific T-cell response [26]. Furthermore,
liver toxicity of anti-retroviral drugs and the burden of
metabolic diseases may contribute to a faster progression
of liver fibrosis in HIV-HCV co-infected patients.
Conversely, the role of HCV on the natural history of
HIV infection continue to be debated and contrasting
evidence exist [27,28].
HCV replication has been observed in extra-hepatic tis￾sues, such as bone marrow, the central nervous system,
endocrine glands, lymph nodes, spleen, monocytes, macro￾phages and skin cells. HCV is also often associated with
profound alterations in the host immune system, resulting
in immunological abnormalities and even autoimmune
disease such as mixed cryoglobulemia (MC), rheumatoid
factor (RF) production, B cell lymphoproliferative disor￾ders that may progress to non–Hodgkin lymphoma, and
others. Cryoglobulins are immunoglobulins that precipi￾tate in the cold and are classified into three groups, based
on Ig clonality. Type I cryoglobulins are usually associated
with lymphoproliferative disorders, including myeloma
and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, and usually consist
of monoclonal IgM or IgG, rarely IgA. Type II cryoglobu￾lins are composed of polyclonal IgG and monoclonal IgM,
usually characterizing the condition known as essential
MC that is often associated with HCV. Type III MC is also
characterized by RF activity, although polyclonal IgG and
polyclonal IgM exist. The incidence of HCV infection in
MC ranges from 40% to 90%, with geographical variations
[29]. The high incidence of disease among Mediterranean
people and the association of certain human leukocyte
antigen (HLA) supports that genetic factors play a role in
the disease. The clinical picture is characterized by the
skin manifestations ranging from purpura of lower limbs
Zaltron et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2012, 12(Suppl 2):S2

to chronic torpid skin ulcers, more frequent in the sovra￾malleolar regions. Skin reactions include Raynaud’s phe￾nomenon, livedo reticularis, urticaria, and edema.
Arthralgias more frequently involve the hands and the
knees symmetrically. Renal injury may complicate MC in
almost 30% of cases and involvement of the nervous
system from 17% to 60%. Peripheral sensory-motor
neuropathy can represent the first clinical sign of
cryoglobulinemia.
Cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
An important clinical feature of HCV infection is the high
rate of chronic and slowly progressive lifelong infection,
which may lead to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease in
about 10-40% of people with chronic hepatitis C, depend￾ing on the presence of co-factors.
Cirrhosis is defined as the progressive development of
regenerative nodules embedded in fibrous bands in
response to chronic liver injury that leads to portal hyper￾tension and end-stage liver disease [30]. Globally, 57% of
cirrhosis is attributable to either HBV (30%) or HCV
(27%), while alcohol consumption is another important
cause, accounting for about 20% of the cases [2]. Alcoholic
liver disease and hepatitis C prevail in western countries,
whereas hepatitis B is the prevailing cause in most parts of
Asia and sub-Saharan Africa [30]. Liver cirrhosis is a wide￾spread chronic disease in Italy, where it was listed between
the top-ten main causes of death in 2001. Survival of
patients with cirrhosis is heavily influenced by the onset of
complications (i.e., ascites, encephalopathy, jaundice, oeso￾phageal varices bleeding), that occur at a yearly rate of
about 5-7% patients.
Ascites occurs in at least 50% of the patients during their
life, heralding a negative prognosis in the short-medium
term. Elimination of the causal factor delays progression
and could even reverse cirrhosis, even if data about rever￾sibility are contrasting.
Liver cirrhosis is a major risk factor for the development
of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Indeed HCC is the
most severe complication of chronic inflammatory liver
diseases and it is the most frequent primary liver cancer.
As an example, in Italy HCC accounts for as many as 79%
of liver cancers [31]. The incidence of HCC increases pro￾gressively with advancing age in all populations, reaching a
peak at 70 years, with a strong male preponderance [32].
The prevalence of HCC in Italy is 53/100000 and 22/
100000 inhabitants in males and in females respectively
(risk ratio 2:1). It is the fifth cause of death in men (third
cause in the age group 50-69 years) and the seventh cause
of death in women [31]. Recently, the mortality rate has
shown a decrease of 34% in men and 41% in women in
the period 2000-2009 in Italy [33], probably due to an
overall improvement of management of HCC both in
terms of early diagnosis and therapy. On a global scale, the
most frequent causes of HCC are HBV (54%), HCV (31%)
and alcoholic abuse (15%) [34]. In Africa and Asia an
important role of co-factor in the HBV carcinogenesis is
played by dietary exposure to aflatoxin B.
As 90% of HCC are associated with a known underlying
risk factor it is possible to identify patients at high risk for
developing HCC and enter them into surveillance pro￾grams aimed at early detection of neoplastic lesions in
order to reduce disease-related mortality. Periodic ultra￾sound (US) scan is probably the most appropriate surveil￾lance test, even if the outcome is highly dependent on the
expertise of the examiner and on the physical typology of
the patient [35]. Six-monthly surveillance appears to offer
the best cost-benefit ratio [36].
If histology remains the gold-standard, diagnosis may
also be reached with high degree of specificity through
non-invasive techniques (contrast TC or MRI), perform￾ing a 4-phase assessment of the lesion (pre-contrast,
arterial, venous and delayed-contrast phase). Also con￾trast-US may efficiently lead to the diagnosis of HCC,
provided that it is performed by highly skilled examiners
(Figure. 1). HCC staging is based on CT or MRI images,
but MRI is to be preferred when small lesions (Ø < 2 cm)
are present [37]. In the absence of a universally accepted
staging system, the current AASLD and EASL guidelines
endorse the 5-stage Barcelona-Clinic Liver Cancer
(BCLC) classification systems [38] because it links tumor
stage with treatment strategy and includes prognostic
variables related to tumor status, liver function and
health performance status along with treatment-depen￾dant variables.
Public health impact of hepatitis C and its
complications
The burden of HCV-related cirrhosis and HCC on the
health systems of western countries is expected to increase
in the coming years due to the diseases progression wave
of HCV baby boomers, posing an increasing high burden
on hepatologists and infectious diseases specialists.
In Europe, nine million people are affected by chronic
hepatitis C and 86,000 people die each year because of
HCV infection. In this continent, about 60-70% of HCC
cases are caused by HCV and data from several eur￾opean countries suggest that the mortality from liver
cancer is rising [39].
In particular, Italy is the European country with the
largest number of people chronically infected by hepati￾tis C virus [40], which is the leading cause of hepatic
disease in this country. In Italy, chronic liver diseases
impact on National Health System with about 160,000
hospital discharge diagnosis and account overall for 5%
reimbursement due by the Regions to the Hospitals [41].
The Liver Match, an observational cohort study that
prospectively enrolled liver transplantations performed
Zaltron et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2012, 12(Suppl 2):S2
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/12/S2/S2

at 20 Italian transplant Centers between 2007 and 2009,
reported that hepatitis virus-related end stage liver dis￾ease (with and without HCC) accounts for 64.2% of
indications to transplantation and HCV is the most fre￾quent etiologic factor; in addition, 54% of the cases of
HCV-related cirrhosis is associated with HCC [42].
Screening strategies
As most HCV-infected individuals are unaware of their
infection status, they are therefore not monitored nor
offered expert advice or treatment, when needed. The
knowledge of the basic drivers of HCV infection (risk
factors, geographical origin, age groups, etc.) may pro￾vide the rationale for screening strategies aimed at
detecting those individuals who might benefit from the
new therapeutic advances. Most health authorities have
recommended HCV screening in those individuals more
likely to be infected [43]. When individuals at high-risk
for HCV infection have been screened, high HCV preva￾lence have been indeed detected, as expected. However,
the efficacy of this risk-based strategies has proved far
from optimal and many patients, even those with recog￾nized high risk of exposure, remain unscreened and
undetected even in western countries. Furthermore, it
has been estimated that as many as 30-45% of HCV￾infected patients in western countries do not have sig￾nificant risk factors nor elevated transaminase levels, so
that they are missed by targeted screening. When blind
screening to the general population attending large
Emergency Departments in Germany have been carried
out, a higher HCV seroprevalence than expected has
been documented [44]. Recently, the cost-benefit to
enlarge the criteria for HCV screening in order to detect
a larger number of HCV-infected individuals has been
addressed and found favorable in the medium term pro￾vided that referral, treatment and cure were made avail￾able. In this model simulation, the incremental cost,
compared to risk-based guidelines, for every quality￾adjusted life year (QALY) gained was 7,900 $ and 4,200
$ if once-time HCV screening was to be proposed to
the 20-69 yrs old or to the baby-boomers (birth date
from 1945 to 1965) US population, respectively [45].
On the basis of the growing epidemiological evidences,
the US Department of Health and Human Services has
recently issued the 2012 “Recommendations for the iden￾tification of chronic hepatitis C virus infection among
persons born during 1945-1965” [46] recommending
HCV screening testing for adults born in the period
1945-65 (one-time testing) in addition to testing adults of
all ages reporting risk factors for HCV infection.
