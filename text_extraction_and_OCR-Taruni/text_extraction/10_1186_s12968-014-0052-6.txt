Abstract
Background: Serial surveillance endomyocardial biopsies are performed in patients who have recently undergone
heart transplantation in order to detect acute cardiac allograft rejection (ACAR) before symptoms occur, however
the biopsy process is associated with a number of limitations. This study aimed to prospectively and longitudinally
evaluate the performance of multiparametric cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) for detecting and
monitoring ACAR in the early phase post-transplant, and characterize graft recovery following transplantation.
Methods: All patients receiving a heart transplant at a single UK centre over a period of 25 months were
approached within one month of transplantation. Multiparametric CMR was prospectively performed on the same
day as biopsy on four separate occasions (6 weeks, 10 weeks, 15 weeks and 20 weeks post-transplant). CMR
included assessment of global and regional ventricular function, myocardial tissue characterization (T1 mapping,
T2 mapping, extracellular volume, LGE) and pixel-wise absolute myocardial blood flow quantification. CMR parameters
were compared with biopsy findings. As is standard, grade 2R or higher ACAR was considered significant.
Results: 88 CMR-matched biopsies were performed in 22 patients. Eight (9%) biopsies in 5 patients demonstrated
significant ACAR. Significant ACAR was associated with a reduction in circumferential strain (−12.7 ± 2.5% vs. -13.7 ±
3.6%, p = 0.047) but there was considerable overlap between groups. Whilst trends were observed between ACAR and
proposed CMR markers of oedema, particularly after adjusting for primary graft dysfunction, differences were not
significant. Significant improvements were seen in markers of graft structure and contractility, oedema and
microvascular function over the period studied, although few parameters normalised.
Conclusions: This study provides novel insight into the myocardial injury associated with transplantation, and
its recovery, however multiparametric CMR was not able to accurately detect ACAR during the early phase
post-transplantation.

Background
Acute cardiac allograft rejection (ACAR) affects approxi￾mately 20% of patients in the first year post-transplantation,
and represents a leading cause of death during this period
[1]. Moreover, even when apparently successfully treated,
an episode of ACAR occurring during the first year con￾fers higher two- and four-year mortality in patients surviv￾ing beyond the first year [1].
Clinical features of ACAR are unreliable, with patients
usually remaining asymptomatic until hemodynamic
complications ensure. Routine screening is therefore per￾formed in order to detect ACAR, and hence augment
immunosuppressive therapy, at an earlier stage, with the
aim of preventing progression to more severe disease,
and potentially reducing the risk of long-term complica￾tions. ACAR surveillance is performed via histological
analysis of right ventricular myocardial tissue obtained
at endomyocardial biopsy, and patients undergo fre￾quent biopsies (10–15) during the first post-operative
year. However, the procedure is invasive (complication
rate 0.5-1.5%), expensive and disliked by patients, fac￾tors which prevent more frequent monitoring, limit￾ing optimal titration of immunosuppressive therapy [2].
Furthermore the sensitivity of the technique is limited
by sampling error due to the patchy nature of ACAR
and variability in interpretation of the histological ap￾pearances [3].
Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is a poten￾tially attractive screening modality for ACAR due to its
lack of ionizing radiation and its multiparametric nature,
i.e. its ability to assess multiple aspects of myocardial in￾jury in a single examination, including global and regional
ventricular function, myocardial oedema (quantitative T1
and T2 mapping), myocardial blood flow and focal (late
gadolinium enhancement, LGE) and diffuse (extracellular
volume; ECV) myocardial interstitial expansion.
Systematic evaluation of multiparametric CMR for diag￾nosing ACAR has not been reported to date. The aims of
this prospective study were to assess the performance of
multiparametric CMR for detecting and monitoring ACAR,
to characterize the graft injury following transplantation
and to longitudinally evaluate graft recovery in the early
phase post-transplantation.
Methods
Patients and study design
All patients receiving a heart transplant at a single center
over a 25 month period were prospectively approached
within one month of undergoing transplantation (Figure 1).
The only exclusion criteria were contraindications to
CMR scanning and inability to give informed consent.
The work was conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki, an ethics committee of the UK
National Research Ethics Service approved the study
(09/H1003/100) and written informed consent was ob￾tained from all participants.
Each patient was prospectively scanned on the same
day as biopsy on four separate occasions. As pre-specified,
scans were performed to coincide with biopsies scheduled
for 6 weeks, 10 weeks, 15 weeks and 20 weeks post￾transplant. Investigators were blinded to biopsy results
i.e. scans were not performed on the basis of confirmed
or suspected ACAR. CMR was performed immediately
before or after biopsy, the order of which was determined
randomly. Due to concerns over cumulative gadolinium
contrast agent dose, the parts of the protocol requiring
contrast agent were performed in two out of the four
scans in each patient. Patients with an estimated glomeru￾lar filtration rate of 35 ml/min/1.73 m2 or less did not
undergo the parts of the protocol requiring contrast
agent. In addition, 10 age- and sex-matched healthy
volunteers (asymptomatic, no risk factors, normal physical
examination, normal electrocardiogram) were recruited to
undergo CMR scanning.
CMR acquisition
CMR was performed at 1.5T (Avanto; Siemens Medical
Imaging, Germany) with a 32-element phased-array coil.
Steady-state free precession cine images were acquired
in standard long-axis views and in a stack of short-axis
slices covering the left ventricle (LV). Short-axis tagged
images were acquired at basal, mid and apical ventricular
levels using a segmented k-space fast gradient echo se￾quence with spatial modulation of magnetization in or￾thogonal planes. A single-shot modified Look Locker
inversion recovery (MOLLI) sequence was acquired in
short-axis at mid-ventricular level before contrast agent
was administered, and 15-minutes after the contrast

agent ‘top-up’ (see below) [4]. Same day haematocrit was
measured. A T2 -prepared SSFP sequence was acquired
in short-axis at mid-ventricular level in late diastole at
preparation times, T2prep, of 0, 24, 45, 65 ms. [5] Perfu￾sion imaging was performed as described previously [6].
Briefly, a saturation recovery gradient echo sequence was
acquired during adenosine stress and at rest following a
0.05 mmol/kg bolus of gadolinium-based contrast agent
(gadopentetate dimeglumine; Gd-DTPA; Magnevist; Bayer
Healthcare, Germany). Following rest perfusion image ac￾quisition, a further 0.1 mmol/kg of contrast agent was ad￾ministered (‘top-up’) to bring the total dose to 0.2 mmol/
kg. Standard late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging
was performed at least 10 minutes following the contrast
agent ‘top-up’.
CMR analysis
LV mass, end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume and
ejection fraction (EF) were quantified from steady-state free
precession images using CMRtools (Cardiovascular Im￾aging Solutions, UK) [7]. Peak systolic circumferential
strain (εcc) and strain rate (systolic and early-diastolic) were
measured from mid-ventricular short-axis tagged images
using SinMod (inTag, CREATIS lab, France, and Maastricht
University, The Netherlands, v5.0) [8]. Basal and apical
short-axis rotation, calculated from tagged images using the
same software, and epicardial areas, were incorporated into
a custom-written algorithm (Microsoft Excel using Visual
Basic) in order to calculate twist (basal rotation–apical ro￾tation), normalized twist (twist angle divided by distance
between slices) and torsion (circumferential-longitudinal
shear angle; calculated by multiplying normalized twist by
mean of basal and apical epicardial radii).
Myocardial T1 relaxation time was measured as de￾scribed previously [9]. Briefly, voxel-wise T1 relaxation
maps (‘T1 mapping’) were obtained from the MOLLI
images using a 3 parameter fit to signal intensity, S as a
function of effective inversion time (TIeff ) according to
S(TIeff ) = A - Be(−TIeff/T1*) and T1 was calculated as T1 =
T1*((B/A)-1). After applying a heart-rate correction algo￾rithm, mean mid-ventricular pixel T1 relaxation times
before and after contrast were then used to calculate myo￾cardial extracellular volume (ECV) according the follow￾ing formula: ECV = λ × (1- haematocrit). Where the
partition coefficient, λ = ΔR1(myocardium)/ΔR1(blood).
ΔR1 is proportional to contrast agent concentration.
ΔR1 = R1(post-contrast) – R1(pre-contrast).
Voxel-wise T2 relaxation maps (‘T2 mapping’) were
obtained from the T2-prepared SSFP images using a
linear least squares fit to the log transformed signal
intensity in each voxel according to In(S) = In(S0) –
(T2prep/T2) where S is the measured signal intensity
and S0 is the fitted signal intensity corresponding to
no T2-preparation (T2prep = 0).
Perfusion quantification was performed as described pre￾viously [6]. Briefly, signal intensity curves were extracted
from the average signal in the blood pool, to provide an ar￾terial input function, and on a voxel-wise basis from myo￾cardial regions of interest. Signal intensity was converted
to contrast agent concentration [10]. Perfusion values were
obtained on a voxel-wise basis using generalized Tikhonov
deconvolution with a b-spline representation of the im￾pulse response function [11]. Myocardial perfusion reserve
(MPR) was calculated by dividing median hyperaemic
myocardial blood flow (MBF) by median resting MBF.
LGE images were reported visually by 2 experienced opera￾tors and the presence or absence of LGE, and its distribu￾tion pattern, were recorded.
Endomyocardial biopsy and histological analysis
Right ventricular biopsy was performed in a standard
manner. Five to ten tissue samples were obtained from the
right ventricular septum, stained with haematoxylin and
eosin and analysed with light microscopy. Tissue was
graded according to the 2005 Revision of the International
Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) Stan￾dardized Cardiac Biopsy Grading Criteria [12]. Immuno￾suppressive therapy is generally augmented at grade 2R or
higher and thus grades 2R – 3R were considered ‘signifi￾cant’ ACAR and grades 0R – 1R ‘non-significant’ ACAR.
As is the clinical policy at our Institution, immunopatho￾logical assessment was performed if histological features
of antibody-mediated rejection were present or if there
was a high clinical suspicion of ACAR in the absence of
significant acute cellular rejection. Patients treated for
ACAR on the basis of high clinical suspicion alone (i.e. in
the absence of ≥ grade 2R acute cellular rejection or anti￾body mediated rejection) were also recorded. Patients
were followed up in order to determine ACAR grade on
the biopsy subsequent to those included in study.
Statistical analysis
All data was analysed in a blinded fashion, with independ￾ent analysis of CMR and biopsy data. Statistical analysis
was performed using SPSS (IBM, USA; v20). Continuous
variables are expressed as mean ± SD unless stated. An
independent-samples t test (or Mann–Whitney U test
where appropriate) was used to compare baseline trans￾plant patient and healthy volunteer demographic data.
CMR data were assessed according to ACAR grade using
generalized estimating equations (GEE) with an ordinal lo￾gistic model in order to adjust for the repeated measure￾ments over time within in each subject. Subsequently,
CMR data were dichotomized according to the presence
(≥ grade 2R) or absence (grade 0R – 1R) of significant
ACAR and compared using GEE with a binary logistic
model. CMR data from healthy volunteers and transplant
patients without significant ACAR were compared using
Miller et al. Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance 2014, 16:52 Page 3 of 11

the same method. A GEE linear regression model was
used to compare CMR data between scans performed at
different time points, and also to assess the relationship
between CMR parameters. CMR data from transplant pa￾tients at a single time-point were compared with data
from healthy volunteers using an independent t test.
Results
Study population and biopsy results
Twenty-two patients were recruited (Figure 1). Demo￾graphic data are presented in Table 1. Each patient under￾went CMR on the same day as biopsy on four separate
occasions i.e. 88 biopsies and corresponding CMR scans
in total. Median (IQR) timing of the four scans was 6.9
(4.9-8.3) weeks, 10.9 (9.5-12.6) weeks, 16.6 (13.2-19.6)
weeks and 22.3 (19.6-26.3) weeks post-transplantation.
Five patients (23%) displayed grade 2R ACAR on biopsies
included in the study. Three of these patients demon￾strated grade 2R ACAR on 2 separate occasions. Of the
88 biopsies included in the study, 48 (55%) were grade 0R,
29 (33%) were grade 1R, 8 (9%) were grade 2R, 0 were
grade 3R and 3 (3%) were inadequate (insufficient tissue
to allow accurate interpretation). No biopsy demonstrated
antibody mediated rejection and no patient was treated
for ACAR on the basis of high clinical suspicion alone.
Eight (36%) patients underwent CMR without contrast
agent (5 patients had severe renal dysfunction and 3 pa￾tients refused consent). Healthy volunteers and transplant
recipients were well matched (Table 1).
ACAR
Multiparametric CMR data is presented in Table 2. Whilst
εcc, native T1 and T2 data demonstrated a trend towards a
deterioration as ACAR severity increased, only εcc showed
a significant difference between significant and non￾significant ACAR, although the absolute difference was
small and there was considerable overlap between groups
(Table 2, Figures 2 and 3). The outcome was no different
if analysis was performed using CMR data from septal seg￾ments only. Pericardial effusion, seen on 9 scans (10%),
was unrelated to ACAR (p = 0.864). Only one biopsy dem￾onstrating significant ACAR was accompanied by a CMR
scan that was performed with contrast agent, hence mean￾ingful assessment of perfusion, LGE and ECV data with
regards to ACAR was not possible.
Six of the 8 subsequent biopsies to those showing sig￾nificant ACAR demonstrated non-significant ACAR after
immunosuppressive treatment and had corresponding
CMR data (one patient demonstrated grade 2R on 2 con￾secutive biopsies and one patient showed grade 2R ACAR
on biopsy number 4 hence no follow-up CMR data was
available). On these ‘convalescent’ scans, CMR parameters
were seen to return to ‘baseline’ levels (εcc: −15.0 ± 2.5%,
native T1: 1048 ± 36 ms, T2: 55.6 ± 3.4 ms).
Five biopsies demonstrating non-significant ACAR were
followed by a subsequent biopsy performed within 28 days
that demonstrated grade 2R. CMR data corresponding to
these biopsies demonstrated εcc (−13.5 ± 2.2%), native T1
(1090 ± 56 ms) and T2 (58.8 ± 3.1 ms) values that were

intermediate to values for non-significant and significant
ACAR.
Time from transplantation
CMR findings according to scan number (i.e. time from
transplantation) are displayed in Table 3. LV mass, εcc,
native T1 and T2 decreased significantly, and MPR in￾creased significantly, between scans 1 and 4 (Figure 4).
Seven patients (32%) demonstrated a pericardial effusion
on scan 1, which had resolved in all but 2 patients by
scan 2; pericardial effusion was not observed on scans 3
and 4 in any patient (p = 0.002). On LGE imaging, one
patient displayed evidence of an anterior myocardial in￾farction and another patient demonstrated right ven￾tricular insertion point enhancement, but no temporal
changes were observed. At the time of scan 4, LV volu￾metrics, EF, SR and T2 were not significantly different
between transplant recipients and healthy volunteers, al￾though other parameters remained abnormal.
Influence of other factors on CMR findings
Three patients (14%) developed primary graft dysfunction
(PGD). In these patients, mean baseline EF was 26.2 ±
4.9% (versus 63.0 ± 7.5% in patients without graft dysfunc￾tion, p < 0.001) and remained severely impaired across all
4 scans, albeit with some improvement (Table 4). Mea￾sures of contractile function and tissue characterization
parameters were also markedly abnormal in these pa￾tients and were significantly different to patients with￾out PGD (Table 4). In light of these findings, analysis
of CMR data with regards to ACAR was repeated after
adjusting for PGD, with results as follows (non-significant
ACAR vs. significant ACAR): εcc 14.4 ± 3.2% vs. 12.7 ±
2.5%, p = 0.015; native T1 1067 ± 43 ms vs. 1118 ± 51 ms,
p = 0.100; T2 56.3 ± 2.7 ms vs. 58.8 ± 3.5 ms, p = 0.110
(Figure 2).
Eight patients (36%) were treated for CMV infection
while taking part in the study (20 biopsies performed
during CMV treatment). After adjusting for PGD, no
CMR parameter differed significantly according to CMV
infection.
Relationship between CMR parameters
There were significant linear relationships between LVEF
and εcc (LVEF = −0.49εcc + 53; p = 0.044), LVEF and
peak systolic SR (LVEF = −8.9SR + 51; p = 0.016), LVEF
and T1 (LVEF = −0.04T1 + 106; p = 0.006), LVEF and T2
(LVEF = −0.65T1 + 97; p = 0.005), T1 and T2 (T1 = 7.9T2 +
629; p < 0.001); T1 and εcc (T1 = 4.5εcc + 1148; p = 0.004);
T2 and εcc (T2 = 0.43εcc + 63; p < 0.001) and T2 and peak
systolic SR (T2 = 4.2SR + 61; p = 0.002).
Discussion
In this study CMR was not able to accurately detect
ACAR in the early phase post-transplantation. However,
this study does demonstrate the complexity of factors af￾fecting allograft structure and function in this period
and provides novel insight into the myocardial injury as￾sociated with transplantation, and its recovery.
Most published studies investigating the role of non￾invasive ACAR surveillance techniques select patients
known/suspected to have ACAR, and commonly include
patients outside the time period when the early detection
of ACAR is likely to be most useful [13]. In contrast, the

current study used an unselected cohort and focused on
the time period when ACAR is of greatest clinical import￾ance (i.e. the first 6 post-operative months) [1].
The per-patient incidence of significant ACAR in the
current study (23%) is in keeping with that reported in
the most recent data from the ISHLT Registry [1].
Nevertheless, in keeping with other contemporary stud￾ies in this field, the number of episodes of significant
ACAR captured (9%) is relatively small and reflects the
decreasing incidence of ACAR secondary to advances in
immunosuppression [14]. Indeed, while the decreasing
incidence of ACAR makes biopsy increasingly unattractive
(the yield of biopsy is now of the same order of magnitude
as its complication rate), the decreasing incidence makes
the assessment of new surveillance techniques more diffi￾cult [2].
In the present study εcc was significantly lower in grade
2R ACAR compared to grades 0R and 1R, although the
absolute difference was small and there was considerable
overlap between groups, indeed by considering all data
points as independent (i.e. by not taking into account the
repeated measurements within each patient) which allows
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to
be performed, sensitivity and specificity of εcc for

have been excluded.

detecting significant ACAR were only 75% and 64% re￾spectively (area under curve (AUC) 0.69, 95% confidence
intervals 0.53-0.85). In a rodent transplant model, Wu
et al. [15] found regional impairment of εcc, as assessed
with CMR tagging, to correspond to areas of macrophage
infiltration, however echocardiographic data in humans
regarding the utility of strain (in all orthogonal directions)
for detecting ACAR is inconsistent [16,17].
Myocardial T1 and T2 relaxation times are sensitive to
changes in myocardial water content and have been pro￾posed to detect myocardial oedema in other conditions
[18-20]. However, in the current study, myocardial T1
and T2 were not significantly higher in grade 2R ACAR
compared to grades 0R-1R, although both demonstrated
trends towards higher values, particularly after account￾ing for PGD.
In a recent study by Usman et al. [14], ACAR was as￾sociated with elevated myocardial T2, which is in keep￾ing with the findings of an early CMR study by Marie
et al. [21]. However, there are important differences be￾tween these studies and the current study. In the studies
by Usman et al. and Marie et al. patients were substan￾tially longer post-transplant than in the current study,
thus reducing the effect of transplant-related myocardial
injury, described below, on T2 measurements, but also
missing the window in which early detection of ACAR is

thought to be most useful (also see below). In addition,
both studies specifically selected patients known/suspected
of having ACAR and different definitions of ‘significant’
ACAR were used. Finally, neither study made statistical
adjustment for repeated measurements within the same
patients (for example 33 patients in the study by Marie
et al. underwent 2 – 4 CMR scans). Indeed if equivalent
statistical methods to those used by Usman and Marie
are applied here, the differences in T2 (and T1) between
ACAR groups after accounting for PGD become signifi￾cant (T2: p = 0.016; T1: p = 0.008) although the sensitivity
and specificity remain modest (T2: 75% and 67% respect￾ively, AUC 0.74 (0.53-0.95); T1: 83% and 72% respect￾ively, AUC 0.79 (0.59-0.98)). The role of myocardial T1
in ACAR has not been previously evaluated using contem￾porary CMR techniques.
Whilst recognizing that CMR methods requiring gado￾linium contrast agent would be undesirable for ACAR sur￾veillance, post-contrast CMR techniques were included in
order to provide further characterization of ACAR patho￾physiology. However the size of the cohort studied and
prevalence of renal impairment, typical of many studies
involving transplant patients, meant insufficient patients
with ACAR underwent contrast-enhanced CMR to allow
meaningful comparison of these parameters.
This study does serve to provide detailed characterization
of the evolution of LV structure and function during the
early phase post-transplantation. Over the first 5 post￾operative months significant improvements were seen in
markers of LV structure (mass) and contractility (εcc), pro￾posed markers of myocardial oedema (native T1, T2 and
ECV) and microvascular function (MPR), although few
parameters normalized.
The insults to which the donor heart is subjected in
the peri-transplant period, including brain death and its
sequelae, ischemia and reperfusion, are likely to cause
considerable myocardial injury, despite the preservation
of gross markers of cardiac function (e.g. EF) in most pa￾tients. The current study comprehensively characterizes
this myocardial injury for the first time, suggesting that
it manifests as myocardial oedema, microvascular dys￾function and, likely as a consequence of both of these
factors and of direct myocyte injury, impaired contractile
function. The study also provides insight into its natural
history, demonstrating how the injury improves over the
first 5-months post-transplant but also showing that it
persists for at least this period, with few parameters
returning to normal over this time. Furthermore it is of
considerable interest to note that proposed markers of
oedema were significantly higher in patients that devel￾oped PGD compared to other allograft recipients, and
remained elevated over the period studied. The mecha￾nisms of myocardial stunning, seen in ischemic heart dis￾ease, include myocardial oedema; possibly via increasing

the distance between actin and myosin filaments, which
in turn leads to reduced contractility [22,23]. The patho￾physiological mechanisms of PGD are not well understood
and are likely multifactorial, but the results of this study
suggest that, analogous to myocardial stunning, oedema
may play an important role.
There has been little previous investigation into temporal
changes in allograft structure and function in the early
phase post-transplant. Using echocardiography, Antunes
et al. [24] found LV EF to improve significantly over the
first month post-transplantation. Eleid et al. [17] found εcc,
assessed using serial speckle-tracking echocardiography,
remained markedly impaired compared to healthy subjects
throughout the first two post-operative years although de￾gree of temporal change was not reported. Wisenburg
et al. [25] using spin echo sequences at 0.15T, found myo￾cardial T1 and T2 to be elevated in all patients during the
very early period post-transplant however values returned
to normal 25 days post-transplant. In the current study
myocardial T1 and T2 remained elevated for considerably
longer, which is in keeping with contemporary CMR find￾ings in other pathologies such as myocardial infarction
or myocarditis [23]. Finally in keeping with the current
study, Preumont et al. [26] demonstrated higher MPR, as
assessed using Nitrogen-13 PET, in patients with angio￾graphically normal epicardial coronary arteries scanned at
9-months post-transplant compared to matched patients
scanned at 3-months post-transplant.
Taking the findings of the current study and of Usman
et al. [14] together it may be that CMR parameters be￾come more useful for detecting ACAR as time from trans￾plantation increases and the transplant-related myocardial
injury subsides. The paradox however is that while non￾invasive approaches to ACAR surveillance may become
more discriminatory as time from transplantation in￾creases, the benefit of the early detection of ACAR dimin￾ishes, indeed the usefulness of routine screening later than
one year post-transplant is subject to debate [2,27].
Limitations
Despite over 2 years of recruitment and a recruitment
rate of over 75% in those eligible, the number of patients
included is relatively small. This is in part reflective of
the robust study design, although the size of the cohort
and number of scans performed here are in keeping with
many studies assessing non-invasive approaches to
ACAR surveillance. As acknowledged earlier, the num￾ber of episodes of significant ACAR captured is also
relatively small. It is also recognized that biopsy is lim￾ited as a reference standard, with ‘biopsy-negative’ ACAR
widely reported [3], however patients were followed-up
in order to identify those treated for ACAR in the ab￾sence of positive biopsy. Baseline post-transplant coronary
angiography was not performed and as such epicardial
coronary disease cannot be excluded as a cause of the low
MPR seen in transplant recipients, however given that
MPR improved significantly over time this is unlikely. Fi￾nally, as is well documented elsewhere, histological valid￾ation of T1 and T2 imaging for detecting and quantifying
non-infarct related myocardial oedema is lacking. Never￾theless, our application of T1 and T2 sequences is in keep￾ing with contemporary literature.
Conclusions
In this study, multiparametric CMR demonstrated that
multiple factors affect cardiac allograft structure and
function in the early phase post-transplantation. Whilst
CMR provided novel insight into the myocardial injury
associated with transplantation, it was not able to accur￾ately detect ACAR as diagnosed by biopsy during this
period.
