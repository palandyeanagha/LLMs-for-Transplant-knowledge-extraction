Fibroblasts are the most common cell type of the connective tissues found throughout the
body and the principal source of the extensive extracellular matrix (ECM) characteristic of
these tissues. They are also the central mediators of the pathological fibrotic accumulation
of ECM and the cellular proliferation and differentiation that occurs in response to
prolonged tissue injury and chronic inflammation. The transformation of the fibroblast cell
lineage involves classical developmental signaling programs and includes a surprisingly
diverse range of precursor cell types—most notably, myofibroblasts that are the apex of
the fibrotic phenotype. Myofibroblasts display exaggerated ECM production; constitutively
secrete and are hypersensitive to chemical signals such as cytokines, chemokines, and
growth factors; and are endowed with a contractile apparatus allowing them to manipulate
the ECM fibers physically to close open wounds. In addition to ECM production,
fibroblasts have multiple concomitant biological roles, such as in wound healing,
inflammation, and angiogenesis, which are each interwoven with the process of fibrosis.
We now recognize many common fibroblast-related features across various physiological
and pathological protracted processes. Indeed, a new appreciation has emerged for
the role of non-cancerous fibroblast interactions with tumors in cancer progression.
Although the predominant current clinical treatments of fibrosis involve non-specific
immunosuppressive and anti-proliferative drugs, a variety of potential therapies under
investigation specifically target fibroblast biology.

INTRODUCTION
Fibroblasts are the workhorse of the most important tissue that
holds the human body together—connective tissue. Connective
tissue joins and supports all other tissues, including the parenchy￾mal tissues of organs. This connective tissue is made of fibroblasts
widely-spaced in a vast extracellular matrix (ECM) of fibrous
proteins and gelatinous ground substance. Fibroblasts produce
the ECM’s structural proteins (e.g., fibrous collagen and elastin),
adhesive proteins (e.g., laminin and fibronectin), and ground
substance (e.g., glycosaminoglycans, such as hyaluronan and gly￾coproteins). However, fibroblasts also play various additional
roles beyond ECM production. For example, fibroblasts serve piv￾otal roles in ECM maintenance and reabsorption, wound healing,
inflammation, angiogenesis, cancer progression, and in physio￾logical as well as pathological tissue fibrosis. Ancillary to these
various biological roles, fibroblasts produce and respond to a
broad array of paracrine and autocrine signals, such as cytokines
and growth factors. Targeting these ancillary signaling events is
the main strategy underlying multiple lines of research for a new
generation of treatments for fibroblast-related disorders.
Fibroblasts are mesenchymal cells derived from the embryonic
mesoderm tissue, and they are not terminally differentiated. They
can be activated by a variety of chemical signals that promote
proliferation and cellular differentiation to form myofibroblasts
with an up-regulated rate of matrix production. Fibroblast acti￾vation plays a vital role in wound healing however, in some cases
and for reasons that remain to be fully elucidated, their activation
becomes uncontrolled, producing a pathological fibrotic response
that promotes multiple diseases and affects a variety of organs.
Indeed, fibrosis plays a significant contributory role in most cases
of organ failure. Examples are wide ranging: systemic sclerosis
(SSc); idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF); liver cirrhosis; kidney
fibrosis; and the cardiac fibrosis observed in cardiac hypertrophy
resulting in heart failure. The essential role of fibroblasts in lung
fibrosis was validated using lineage-specific deletion of the type II
TGFβ receptor (Hoyles et al., 2011).
Here we review a variety of fibroblast functions that illustrate a
central role for fibroblasts in the pathology of fibrosis. We review
ECM production in relation to fibrosis, some examples of criti￾cal chemical signaling, myofibroblast differentiation, the role of
fibroblasts in stromal-cancer interactions, and potential clinical
therapies targeting fibroblasts.
FIBROBLAST ROLE IN MATRIX PRODUCTION AND
MAINTENANCE
Fibroblasts’ most well-known biological role is the production
of the rich ECM of connective tissues. Fibroblasts produce and
secrete all components of the ECM, including the structural pro￾teins, adhesive proteins, and a space-filling ground substance
composed of glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans.
STRUCTURAL PROTEINS
Fibroblasts produce an interconnecting meshwork of extracellu￾lar protein fibers and connector proteins that provide structure
to tissue. Reciprocally, these proteins can promote the differen￾tiation of profibrotic myofibroblasts through positive feedback

regulation during fibrosis (Blaauboer et al., 2013). The vari￾ety of ECM structures serve roles as diverse as forming lamina
that delineate borders separating distinct cell types with dif￾ferent functions, to serving as interstitial regions that connect
cells of a common type with a common biological function.
Fibroblasts provide these specialized ECMs in different tissues
by expressing and secreting a robust and variable repertoire of
structural proteins with distinct properties. For example, the fib￾ril rigidity provided by collagen type I, the most abundant protein
in mammals, is due to its rope-shaped, triple-stranded helical
tertiary protein structure that reinforces its tensile strength, pre￾venting overstretching. In contrast, elastin proteins form highly
crosslinked, yet unstructured, elastic networks that allow for
expansive stretching without breaking. Tissues requiring differ￾ing degrees of rigidity vs. flexibility, such as skin and lung, differ
in the relative expression of collagen subtype and elastin pro￾teins. Moreover, the pathological histology of fibrosis includes an
increase in the relative balance of collagen (Gilbane et al., 2013;
McKleroy et al., 2013). A large number of genes that express dif￾ferent collagen subtypes also provide unique matrix properties.
Fibroblast-mediated formation of basement membrane (com￾posed of a layer of basal lamina and a layer of reticular lamina)
serve as structural scaffolds critical for tissue regeneration in
wound healing; cell barriers segregating epithelial from endothe￾lial tissues; barriers preventing malignant escape or invasion of
cancerous cells; filtration devices found in the glomerular filtra￾tion of blood in the kidney; and filtration of the alveoli-capillary
interface in the lung. Basement membrane ECM is composed
largely of collagen type IV, and in this environment, the pres￾ence of collagen type I promotes the up-regulation of TGFβ
and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transdifferentiation (EMT), pro￾ducing, for example, fibroblasts with a profibrotic phenotype in
kidney fibrosis (Zeisberg et al., 2001).
ADHESIVE PROTEINS
Adhesive ECM proteins such as fibronectin and laminin form
the connection between cells and the ECM. Fibronectins bind
to ECM fibers and contain RGD domains required for interact￾ing with the integrin transmembrane cell adhesion proteins. It
is ironic that fibronectin is essential for collagen assembly into
ECM, yet a conditional knock out of fibronectin expression in
the liver was found to increase collagen production, TGFβ sig￾naling, and hepatic fibrosis (Kawelke et al., 2011). Therefore,
locally produced fibronectin in ECM also regulates the amount of
active TGFβ and serves to protect tissue from TGFβ hyperstimu￾lation (Kawelke et al., 2011). Laminins also interact with integrin
receptors to regulate cell attachment to the basal lamina. In fact,
laminin has been proposed as a biomarker for hepatic fibrosis
(Santos et al., 2005).
GROUND SUBSTANCE
The ground substance of ECM is a hydrated gel of proteo￾glycans that is interspersed among the structural proteins. The
ground substance forms a final pathway for nutrient flow
beyond the reach of blood vessel transport into tissues as well
as a pathway for intercellular communication. This cell-free
medium forms an avenue for cell migration of immune cells,
fibroblasts, and myofibroblasts. It is also an essential avenue for
endothelial cell migration during angiogenesis. The proteogly￾cans of ground substance are proteins that are posttranslationally
modified by the addition of unbranched polysaccharides called
glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), or descriptively as mucopolysac￾charides. These GAGs are composed of repeating disaccharide
units that contain an amino sugar of either N-acetylglucosamine
or N-acetylgalactosamine and are often sulphated. The family
of GAG posttranslational modifications found in ECM includes
hyaluronan (non-sulfated), heparin and heparan sulfate, chon￾droitin and dermatan sulfate, and keratan sulfate.
Proteoglycans directly interact with many chemical signals,
such as growth factors and TGFβ. Through these interactions,
the ECM proteoglycans can regulate chemical signaling by either
inhibiting or augmenting a signal’s responsiveness. The proteo￾glycan tenascin-C (TN-C) interacts with ECM (Chung et al.,
1995), cell surface receptors (Schnapp et al., 1995; Midwood
et al., 2009; De Laporte et al., 2013), and is secreted in response
to TGFβ stimulation (Pearson et al., 1988). TN-C is highly
expressed during embryonic development, chronic inflamma￾tion, and fibrosis. Our group has characterized the role of
insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP)-3, which is
overexpressed in fibrotic skin and lungs, in mediating the induc￾tion of TN-C by TGFβ (Brissett et al., 2012). Exposure of lung
fibroblasts in vitro to IGFBP-3 directly induces TN-C production
and secretion. Further, SSc patients with pulmonary fibrosis have
significantly higher levels of circulating TN-C compared with
SSc patients without pulmonary fibrosis (Brissett et al., 2012).
Another ECM proteoglycan, decorin, antagonizes TGFβ activ￾ity (Yamaguchi et al., 1990). Decorin is a small proteoglycan
that contains a single GAG chain of either chondroitin sulfate
or dermatan sulfate. Decorin directly interacts with TGFβ and
inhibits its profibrotic biological activity. Recombinant expres￾sion of decorin in the lung airways of mice inhibits bleomycin￾induced pulmonary fibrosis (Kolb et al., 2001). In addition to
the secreted proteoglycans of the ECM, there are also a number
of cell membrane proteoglycans that can interact with chemi￾cal signals and function as co-receptors. An important example
is the syndecans. Syndecan 2 (SDC2) is over-expressed during
fibrosis and is induced in fibroblasts in response to both TGFβ
and IGFBP-3 (Ruiz et al., 2012). Similar to the above exam￾ples, proteoglycans can also interact with membrane-bound and
secreted proteases such as MMP-7 (Yu and Woessner, 2000) as
well as secreted protease inhibitors such as TIMP-3 (Yu et al.,
2000), regulating their biological activities in signaling and ECM
processing.
ECM MAINTENANCE AND REABSORPTION
In addition to extracellular matrix production, fibroblasts are
also responsible for its maintenance and reabsorption. Unlike
bone, where a specialized cell type, osteoblasts, produces bone
(a highly mineralized extracellular matrix) and a distinct cell
type, osteoclasts, reabsorbs bone, there are no known fibrob￾last cells that specialize in matrix reabsorption. As far as we
know, the same fibroblasts that produce ECM are responsible
for matrix maintenance and degradation. As such, these cells
have important roles in resolving pathological fibrosis. Collagen

Kendall and Feghali-Bostwick The roles of fibroblasts in fibrosis
maturation is controlled by the enzyme lysyl oxidase (Lox), which
is produced by fibroblasts, cross-links collagen fibers, and thereby
strengthens ECM. Interestingly, inhibiting LOX-mediated colla￾gen cross-linking antagonizes both fibrosis and tumor metastasis
(Cox et al., 2013). Collagen turnover (catabolism) is regulated by
a multitude of secreted extracellular proteases. Fibroblasts pro￾duce both matrix degrading enzymes (such as metalloproteinases,
aka MMPs) as well as their inhibitors (the tissue inhibitors of
metalloproteinases, aka TIMPs). Curiously, MMP expression in
IPF is increased, and experiments with various MMP knock￾out mice demonstrate protection from bleomcyin-induced lung
fibrosis (McKleroy et al., 2013).
CONCOMITANT AND INTERWOVEN BIOLOGICAL ROLES OF
FIBROBLASTS
WOUND HEALING
Fibroblasts have a pivotal role in wound healing in response to
tissue injury. First and foremost, fibroblasts respond to wound
healing by proliferating and by chemotaxing to the sites of tissue
injury to rebuild the ECM as a scaffold for tissue regeneration.
Fibroblast to myofibroblast transitioning enables the contraction
of the matrix to seal an open wound in the event of the loss of tis￾sue (Gabbiani, 2003; Midwood et al., 2004). Fibroblasts also play a
role in blood clotting, such as in the production of urokinase plas￾minogen activators (PAs) and their inhibitors (PAIs). Fibroblasts
express the protease activated receptor PAR1 that enables fibrob￾last responsiveness to activated thrombin. PAR1 receptor expres￾sion is upregulated in IPF (Howell et al., 2005) and in lung
tissue of SSc patients (Bogatkevich et al., 2005). Further, PAR1
knockout mice resist bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis (Howell
et al., 2005). PAR1 receptors have well documented roles in the
process of fibrosis, and PAR1 receptor antagonists as well as
thrombin inhibitors could be beneficial for treating SSc and IPF
(Atanelishvili et al., 2014).
INFLAMMATION
Fibroblasts serve roles in inflammation and immune cell recruit￾ment to sites of tissue injury. Furthermore, fibroblasts produce
and are responsive to many inflammatory cytokines. Fibroblasts
are responsive to cytokines such as TGFβ1, IL-1β, interleukin￾6 (IL-6), IL-13, IL-33 (Feghali and Wright, 1997; Scotton and
Chambers, 2007; Savinko et al., 2012), as well as prostaglandins
(Keerthisingam et al., 2001; Stratton et al., 2002; Maher et al.,
2010) and leukotrienes (Mensing and Czarnetzki, 1984; Chibana
et al., 2003; Eap et al., 2012). Fibroblasts are stimulated chemically
by inflammatory agents to differentiate into myofibroblasts that
have a greatly up-regulated rate of matrix production (discussed
in more detail below). In turn, fibroblasts produce and secrete
cytokines such as TGFβ1, IL-1β, IL-33, CXC, and CC chemokines
(Feghali and Wright, 1997; Gharaee-Kermani et al., 2003, 2012;
Scotton and Chambers, 2007), as well as reactive oxygen species
(Amara et al., 2010; Bondi et al., 2010). These factors allow fibrob￾lasts to assist in the activation and migration of resident immune
cells such as macrophages. Moreover, the recruitment of non￾resident immune cells is facilitated by the fibroblast-mediated
production and maintenance of the relatively spacious, non-solid
ground substance of the extracellular matrix, which plays an
important role as a thoroughfare for the extravasation of immune
cells into connective tissue. These tools endow fibroblast roles in
chemical (non-specific) and cell-mediated immunity, acute and
chronic inflammation, and inflammation resolution. Fibroblasts
can contribute to chronic inflammation (Flavell et al., 2008),
and reciprocally, inflammatory cytokines promote fibroblast to
myofibroblast transition, facilitating fibrosis.
ANGIOGENESIS
Fibroblasts have close interactions with endothelial cells and
facilitate angiogenesis into tissues beyond the reach of existing
blood vessels. This response requires the migration of endothe￾lial cells to construct tubes through the ground substance of
connective tissue (Dunn et al., 2000). Fibroblasts play a criti￾cal role in angiogenesis; fibroblast-derived matrix proteins and
cytokines are essential for endothelial cell-mediated lumen for￾mation (Newman et al., 2011). A major mechanism for this
phenomenon is the fibroblast-mediated production and release of
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which acts on VEGF
receptors expressed on endothelial cells to promote angiogene￾sis. Interestingly, dermal fibroblasts from SSc patients overexpress
VEGF in response to autocrine TGFβ signaling (Kajihara et al.,
2013). This VEGF could play a role in the vascular damage that in
turn promotes fibroblast activation, thereby supporting fibrosis
(Kajihara et al., 2013).
ANCILLARY SIGNALING FUNCTIONS OF FIBROBLASTS
The signaling factors associated with fibroblast biology are not
necessarily specific for one biological role over another. Below we
discuss these signaling factors with respect to their sources and
their cellular targets (Figure 1). The net effect of multiple stimuli
that recapitulate the milieu in human tissues is difficult to repro￾duce in the laboratory, although initial efforts using ex vivo organ
cultures such as skin (Yasuoka et al., 2008; Yamaguchi et al., 2012)
are promising.
PARACRINE SIGNALS THAT ACT ON FIBROBLASTS
Some factors act to promote a profibrotic phenotype. Platelet￾derived growth factor (PDGF) (Scotton and Chambers, 2007),
IL-6 (Feghali et al., 1992), IL-13 (Fuschiotti, 2011; Fuschiotti
et al., 2013), and the eicosanoid leukotrienes (Mensing and
Czarnetzki, 1984; Chibana et al., 2003; Eap et al., 2012) are
cytokines that promote inflammation and the development of a
fibrotic response. PDGF is produced by a variety of cell types,
such as platelets, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and
macrophages. It acts on the mesenchyme and fibroblasts to induce
proliferation, differentiation, and ECM production (Scotton and
Chambers, 2007). PDGF is important for wound healing, inflam￾mation, angiogenesis, embryonic development, and fibrosis. IL-6
is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that acts on a range of cell types
and is produced by T cells, macrophages, skeletal muscle cells,
and fibroblasts (Feghali and Wright, 1997). IL-6 has well-known
roles in inflammation, cellular differentiation, and fibrosis. IL-6
is elevated in the blood of SSc patients and produced in excess
by SSc fibroblasts (Feghali et al., 1992; Feghali and Wright, 1997).
Elevated IL-6 levels correlate with worse long-term survival, and
therefore IL-6 could potentially be used as a prognostic clinical

biomarker for patients with diseases such as SSc (Khan et al.,
2012). IL-13 is a cytokine mainly produced by mast cells but
also T lymphocytes (Wynn, 2003), and it acts on multiple cell
types, including fibroblasts. With roles in both inflammation and
fibrosis, IL-13 can stimulate TGFβ production, TGFβ activation,
collagen production, MMP expression, fibroblast proliferation,
and myofibroblast differentiation (Fuschiotti, 2011; Fuschiotti
et al., 2013). The leukotriene eicosanoids are additional signals
that induce fibroblast proliferation and matrix production con￾tributing to fibrosis (Mensing and Czarnetzki, 1984; Chibana
et al., 2003; Eap et al., 2012).
Of special note, the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family
of genetically related protein ligands was originally identified
as mitogens and differentiation factors for fibroblasts (Armelin,
1973; Gospodarowicz, 1974). Despite the fact that this family
has since been found to act on multiple cell types, FGFs require
heparin or heparan sulfate proteoglycan molecules to bind their
surface receptors (Ornitz and Itoh, 2001). Therefore, they require
close proximity to ECM and the fibroblasts that secrete ECM.
There are 22 FGF genes found in humans (Ornitz and Itoh, 2001),
and these genes are alternatively-spliced (Ornitz and Itoh, 2001)
generating additional FGF proteins. FGF ligands activate a fam￾ily of 4 FGF receptors with differing specificities (Dionne et al.,
1991). High amounts of active FGF2 are found in bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid and in lung tissues of patients with pulmonary fibro￾sis (Henke et al., 1991; Inoue et al., 1996). Mast cell-generated
FGF2 correlates with the localization and the extent of fibrosis in
IPF (Inoue et al., 1996, 2002).
Paracrine factors that can antagonize fibrosis have also
been described. The eicosanoids prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)
(Keerthisingam et al., 2001; Maher et al., 2010) and prostacyclin
(PGI2) (Stratton et al., 2002) are two examples of paracrine sig￾nals that inhibit the fibrotic response. PGE2 inhibits fibroblast
proliferation and collagen production (McAnulty et al., 1997;
Goldstein and Polgar, 1982; Saltzman et al., 1982). It acts on target
cells by activating the G protein-coupled EP receptors 1–4. PGE2
has been observed to inhibit fibroblast to myofibroblast differen￾tiation and the TGFβ1 stimulated expression of α smooth muscle
actin (αSMA) in lung fibroblasts via the EP2 subtype receptors
(Kolodsick et al., 2003). PGE2 also has an anti-apoptotic effect on
the alveolar epithelium (Maher et al., 2010). Iloprost is a synthetic
analog of prostacyclin eicosanoid PGI2 that dilates systemic and
pulmonary arterial vascular beds and is used for the treatment of
patients with SSc (Erre and Passiu, 2009).
PARACRINE SIGNALS PRODUCED AND BROADCAST BY FIBROBLASTS
IGFBP-3 and -5, IGF-II, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF),
IL-33, CXC chemokines, CC chemokines, and reactive oxygen
species (ROS) are paracrine signals produced by fibroblasts that
further enhance a tissue fibrotic response. Both IGFBP-3 and -5
are profibrotic factors implicated in SSc and IPF (Veraldi et al.,
2009; Veraldi and Feghali-Bostwick, 2012). CTGF plays pivotal
roles in wound healing, angiogenesis, and fibrosis. It is highly
expressed by endothelial cells in response to a variety of stres￾sors, but it is also expressed and released by fibroblasts. CTGF
interacts with a wide variety of receptors, extracellular ligands,
as well as ECM proteins (Liu et al., 2011a). CTGF knock-out
mice are less responsive to the induction of fibrotic skin lesions
by bleomycin (Liu et al., 2011a). Conversely, transgenic mice
with fibroblast-specific expression of CTGF develop fibrosis with￾out any other profibrotic stimulus and display an accelerated
fibrotic response relative to exogenously added CTGF (Sonnylal
Frontiers in Pharmacology | Inflammation Pharmacology May 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 123 | 4

Kendall and Feghali-Bostwick The roles of fibroblasts in fibrosis
et al., 2010). CTGF is well-characterized to act synergistically
with TGFβ to promote pathological fibrosis. Furthermore, TGFβ1
induces CTGF in fibroblasts (Leof et al., 1986; Paulsson et al.,
1987; Soma and Grotendorst, 1989; Igarashi et al., 1993; Mori
et al., 1999). IL-33 is a cytokine produced primarily by endothe￾lial and smooth muscle cells in the vasculature and the lungs.
However, its production by dermal fibroblasts can also be induced
by inflammation and in cardiac fibroblasts by mechanical stress.
Knocking down IL-33 expression in mice is cardioprotective in
the face of chronic angiotensin II stimulation (Sanada et al.,
2007). IL-33 facilitates inflammation and fibrosis (Savinko et al.,
2012). CXC and CC chemokines are broadcast by fibroblasts
and play significant roles in the chemotaxis of various leuko￾cytes to sites of tissue injury (Gharaee-Kermani et al., 2003,
2012). TGFβ also induces NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) in fibrob￾lasts (Amara et al., 2010; Bondi et al., 2010), implicating reactive
oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress in the pathology of
fibrosis. NOX4 generates a basal level of extracellular H2O2.
NOX4 mRNA expression is increased in rat kidney fibroblasts
in culture (Bondi et al., 2010) and in primary lung fibrob￾lasts derived from the lungs of patients with IPF (Amara et al.,
2010).
Fibroblasts do not typically express and release the angio￾genic hormone angiotensin II (AngII), however both activated
macrophages and myofibroblasts produce AngII during the
pathology of fibrosis (Berk et al., 2007). Although the phe￾nomenon is not well characterized in most tissues, AngII is known
to promote TGFβ-mediated cardiac remodeling (Rosenkranz,
2004) and the fibrosis observed in left ventricular cardiac hyper￾trophy (Rosenkranz, 2004). These findings suggest that AngII
could contribute to fibrosis in other tissues.
AUTOCRINE ACTIONS AMONG FIBROBLASTS
TGFβ (Scotton and Chambers, 2007), IL-1β, and IL-6 (Feghali
and Wright, 1997) are examples of cytokines that are both pro￾duced by fibroblasts (as well as other cell types) and that act
on fibroblasts to promote inflammatory and fibrotic responses.
TGFβs are named after their ability to act on fibroblasts to induce
oncogenic transformation. The three known TGFβ ligands assert
their biological actions by activating TGFβ receptors, cell sur￾face serine/threonine kinase receptors. TGFβ is the prototypic
profibrotic cytokine. It acts on fibroblasts and myofibroblasts to
promote proliferation, migration, matrix production, the pro￾duction of chemotactic signals promoting leukocyte recruitment
to the site of injury, fibrosis, and the differentiation of fibroblasts
to myofibroblasts. Inhibitors of each TGFβ receptor antagonize
fibrosis development in experimental models (Bonniaud et al.,
2005; Fu et al., 2011). The cytokine IL-1β’s expression and release
is induced by a wide variety of cells, including fibroblasts, in
response to inflammation (Feghali and Wright, 1997). IL-1β is a
potent pro-inflammatory cytokine that also induces production
of the profibrotic cytokines PDGF and TGFβ.
Some autocrine fibroblast factors counteract fibrosis, such as
the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). HGF is a protein produced
by fibroblasts and acts by binding the receptor tyrosine kinase
c-Met expressed on nearby epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and
fibroblasts (Bogatkevich et al., 2007a,b; Crestani et al., 2012).
HGF also plays an important role in wound healing, angiogenesis,
and tumorigenesis.
SOURCES OF FIBROBLASTS
Fibroblasts are a heterogeneous cell population that consists of
subsets with different capacities to produce ECM components
such as collagen. Fibroblast subpopulations have been described
in the skin (Jelaska and Korn, 2000) and lung (Pechkovsky et al.,
2010). Furthermore, fibroblast phenotypes may differ across sites
of the same organ, as has been shown in skin. In fact, fibroblasts
from different skin sites retain positional memory with dis￾tinct gene expression profiles (Chang et al., 2002). Furthermore,
fibroblasts are chemotactic and can migrate and accumulate in
new areas in response to secreted cytokines, a behavior well
characterized in the wound healing response after tissue injury.
Although the parenchyme of the liver, pancreas, and lung are
derived from endothelial tissue and the parenchyme of the skin
and brain are derived from epithelial tissue, the stromal connec￾tive tissue found in all organs is derived from mesothelial tissue.
Yet, due to the differing mixture of neighboring tissue types,
there is the potential for differential fibroblast phenotypes and
differential fibrotic responses in each of these organs.
Fibroblasts are not a terminally differentiated cell type and
retain the potential to be activated for differentiation into sub￾types of fibroblast-like cells. Myofibroblasts are rarely found in
healthy human physiology; they become vastly up-regulated after
injury and play a critical role in the wound healing response
(Gabbiani, 2003; Midwood et al., 2004). Myofibroblasts can orig￾inate from a variety of precursor cells, as shown in Figure 2.
Major developmental signaling factors such as the Wnt (Liu
et al., 2012), Notch (Kavian et al., 2012), and Sonic hedge￾hog ligands (Stewart et al., 2003; Ding et al., 2012) have well￾described roles in myofibroblast differentiation from precursor
cells. Myofibroblasts are well characterized to differentiate from
resident fibroblasts in vivo and in vitro in response to profi￾brotic cytokine stimulation. However, myofibroblasts have also
been observed to differentiate from various other precursor cells,
including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, pericytes, multipo￾tent monocytes, and fibrocytes. Whether different cell origins are
the source of myofibroblasts in different tissues remains to be
determined.
The myofibroblast phenotype is characterized as: (i) express￾ing αSMA; (ii) contractile; (iii) having a greater rate of ECM
synthesis and secretion; and (iv) resistant to apoptosis. The con￾tractile biology of myofibroblasts facilitates ECM fiber manipu￾lation and wound contraction at sites of injury. Myofibroblasts
display a heightened and constitutive expression of cytokines,
chemokines, and cell surface receptors (Strehlow and Korn, 1998;
Abraham and Varga, 2005). These differentiated myofibroblasts
also display epigenetic changes (Wang et al., 2006a).
EPITHELIAL CELLS
The EMT has been observed as a source of myofibroblasts in
kidney fibrosis (Ng et al., 1998; Jinde et al., 2001; Liu, 2004);
however, subsequent attempts to trace such phenomena in the
skin, lung, heart, and liver have been largely unsuccessful in vivo,
suggesting that EMT-mediated formation of myofibroblasts is

not substantial. Recent evidence argues against epithelial cells as
the main source of myofibroblast differentiation in idiopathic
lung fibrosis. Using lineage tracing with recombinant td-Tomato
and f-GFP tags and confocal microscopy resolution, Rock et al.
demonstrated focal accumulation of fibroblasts derived from the
proliferation of stromal cells (Rock et al., 2011). Recent trans￾genic lineage tracing studies in mouse kidney also indicate that
most myofibroblasts are not derived from epithelial cells (Lin
et al., 2008; Humphreys et al., 2010). Although these studies
using rodents contradict findings suggesting an epithelial origin
to myofibroblasts, they do not exclude the possibility that EMT
may occur in human tissues.
ENDOTHELIAL CELLS
Another source of myofibroblasts during fibrosis has been
hypothesized to originate from endothelial cells by a process of
endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) (Piera-Velazquez
et al., 2011). This event has been characterized in animal mod￾els of fibrosis; however, similar phenomena in human fibrosis
patients have not yet been well characterized.
VASCULAR SMOOTH MUSCLE CELLS (VSMC)
The many similarities between myofibroblasts and VSMCs pro￾mote the question of a potential lineage relationship between
the two cell types (Yoshida and Owens, 2005). For example,
these cells are contractile and they share multiple markers such
as αSMA, SM22α, desmin, and vimentin (Yoshida and Owens,
2005). Furthermore, myofibroblasts express proteins, such as
osteopontin, that can be induced in VSMCs by phenotypic modu￾lator ligands (Yoshida and Owens, 2005). However, the biological
roles of these two cell types in disease are different (Gan et al.,
2007). Furthermore, myofibroblasts and VSMCs have distinct
transcriptional mechanisms for αSMA expression (Gan et al.,
2007). Observations such as the induction of αSMA expres￾sion in myofibroblasts and the reduction in αSMA expression in
VSMCs during vascular injury (Yoshida and Owens, 2005) sug￾gest the reduction of a contractile phenotype in VSMCs could also
promote another source of myofibroblasts differentiation.
PERICYTES
Pericytes are mesenchyme-derived cells that wrap around small
blood vessel walls and closely associate with the outer surface of
the endothelial cell layer. Pericytes regulate the permeability of
the blood vessel wall; for example, pericytes are the principal cell
type that regulates the permeability of the blood–brain barrier
(Armulik et al., 2010). Pericytes physically interact with endothe￾lial cells and chemically via paracrine signaling to control the tight
junctions and transvessicular trafficking across endothelial cells.
As such, malfunctioning pericytes can promote vascular leaking
(Schrimpf et al., 2012), and the observation that perictyes can be
induced to differentiate into myofibroblasts, losing their pericyte
functionality, suggests that this differentiation may contribute to
both tissue fibrosis and vascular leakage in IPF (Hung et al., 2013).
Pericytes are not a terminally differentiated cell type; they can fur￾ther differentiate into fibroblasts, osteoblasts, and smooth muscle
cells. Pericytes endogenously express αSMA and have a function￾ing contractile apparatus; therefore, distinguishing between these
cells and other cell types is challenging. One genetic fate mapping
study investigating the potential contribution of pericytes in mice
to bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis utilized the nerve/glial anti￾gen 2 (NG2) protein, a chondroitin sulfate cell surface-associated
proteoglycan, as a marker for this cell type. This strategy found

Kendall and Feghali-Bostwick The roles of fibroblasts in fibrosis
no appreciable contribution of pericytes to the expansion of
myofibroblasts and the resulting fibrosis even though the pericyte
population itself did expand significantly (Rock et al., 2011). A
different investigation utilized the forkhead transcription factor
Foxd1 as a marker for lung pericytes and found that up to 68%
of αSMA-expressing cells in fibrotic lungs are pericyte-derived
(Hung et al., 2013). These studies suggest that multiple sub￾populations of pericytes may exist in the lung and differentially
contribute to myofibroblast formation and fibrosis.
MONOCYTES AND FIBROCYTES
Fibrocytes are circulating fibroblast-like cells in the vascular sys￾tem that are derived from bone marrow stem cells (Bucala et al.,
1994). “Fibrocyte” is a term sometimes ascribed to a relatively
inactive fibroblast-like cell, whereas the term “fibroblast” des￾ignates a fully active cell as described throughout our review.
Fibrocytes can extravasate from vessels into connective tissues. In
the kidney, it has been proposed that myofibroblasts in fibrotic
areas could be derived from bone marrow progenitor multipotent
cells via a cellular differentiation lineage: bone marrow progeni￾tor cell to monocyte to fibrocyte to fibroblast (Quan et al., 2004;
Pilling and Gomer, 2012). Circulating CD14+ immunopheno￾typic monocytes derived from the plasma of SSc patients are
reported to express greater αSMA (and so an increased matura￾tion toward myofibroblasts) compared to those of healthy control
individuals but with minor functional contraction properties as
determined with a collagen contraction assay (Binai et al., 2012).
The blood of SSc patients with interstitial lung disease is enriched
for fibrocytes and monocytes with an overt profibrotic phenotype
(Mathai et al., 2010). However, lineage tracing studies in rodents
display differing conclusions. GFP-expressing fibroblasts derived
from the multipotent, transgenic bone marrow transplanted into
chimeric normal mice appear to be a unique population of cells
that do not express αSMA and fail to differentiate into myofibrob￾lasts when extracted and stimulated ex vivo in culture (Hashimoto
et al., 2004; Kisseleva et al., 2006; Barisic-Dujmovic et al., 2010;
Rock et al., 2011). Similarly, using an αSMA promoter-driven
GFP transgenic mouse, no kidney or bone marrow stromal
expression was observed in chimeric wild-type mice (Yokota et al.,
2006). However, the chimeric mice were only analyzed under
physiologic conditions, and no profibrotic stimulus was tested in
this model (Yokota et al., 2006). In contrast, in another study,
bone marrow from GFP transgenic mice were transplanted into
wild-type rats, and a 23% increase in the number of GFP and
αSMA-expressing cells in the pancreas was observed to peak in the
early stage of an experimentally-induced but clinically-relevant
pancreatitis rat model (Mathai et al., 2010; Akita et al., 2012).
In all, despite substantial evidence that activated myofibroblasts
are derived from local stromal fibroblasts, blood borne mono￾cytes and monocyte-derived cells appear to facilitate fibrosis via
the production of ECM and paracrine signaling with resident
profibrotic cells (Murray et al., 2012).
ADVENTITIAL FIBROBLASTS IN PULMONARY
HYPERTENSION
A very similar role of fibroblast activation appears to promote
pulmonary hypertension compounding other fibrotic disorders.
Pulmonary hypertension can be a complication of IPF and SSc
and is a significant contributor to mortality (Lee et al., 1992;
Arcasoy et al., 2001; King et al., 2001). Adventitial fibroblasts
found in blood vessels can be activated by hypoxia and are impli￾cated as a source of myofibroblasts that promote vascular remod￾eling and the associated pulmonary hypertension (Stenmark
et al., 2006).
FIBROBLASTS IN CANCER BIOLOGY
Fibroblasts have an integral role in cancer beyond sarcomas
and cancers originating from fibroblastic cells. Non-cancerous
fibroblasts interact with cancer cells, affecting tumor biology
and pathogenesis. The biological processes of wound healing,
inflammation, fibrosis, angiogenesis, and their associated bio￾chemical machinery all play critical roles in cancer by regulating
the microenvironment of a tumor, tumor size, and tumor inva￾sion of adjacent tissues and metastasis (Mueller and Fusenig,
2004). Fibroblasts in and around tumors are persistently acti￾vated by tumor cells (Kalluri and Zeisberg, 2006). In response,
fibroblasts secrete cytokines and ECM that modulate tumor pro￾gression and regulate stroma-cancer interactions (Madar et al.,
2013). Non-cancerous fibroblasts surrounding tumors contribute
directly to angiogenesis and tumor growth by producing mul￾tifarious signaling molecules (Madar et al., 2013). Fibroblasts
also secrete the ECM that modulates tumor progression, and
fibroblasts remodel the connective tissue surrounding a tumor,
allowing cancerous cells to be released from a contained tumor
into the vascular system, thereby promoting metastasis (Liu et al.,
2011b). As such, fibroblast cells also participate in the pathogen￾esis of carcinomas—the more abundant cancers originating from
epithelial cells. In spite of recent advances in delineating the role
of fibroblasts in tumor progression, the role of these cells in earlier
tumor development is still incompletely understood.
POTENTIAL THERAPIES TARGETING FIBROBLASTS
Since fibroblasts are a central effector cell in fibrosis, they are
suitable therapeutic targets. There have been some recent excit￾ing research findings inciting potential strategies to combat the
pathological fibrotic response that occurs in various disorders.
The examples listed below are not intended to be a comprehen￾sive presentation for the pipeline of future antifibrotic therapies
that target the fibroblast cell lineage. There are multiple strategies
being investigated that are too numerous to cover here. The fol￾lowing examples help to illustrate the diverse range of targeting
strategies where novel therapies potentially could ensue.
ENDOSTATIN
Endostatin is an endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis that has
completed clinical trials as an anticancer agent to prevent the
growth of tumor mass. It inhibits endothelial cell proliferation
and vessel formation (O’Reilly et al., 1997) but also acts on
fibroblasts (Yamaguchi et al., 2012). Endostatin is a small peptide
(20–30 KDa) derived from the carboxy terminus of the collagen
type XVIII produced and released by fibroblasts. Endostatin is
then released from this precursor protein by proteolytic cleavage
by the action of cathepsin L (Felbor et al., 2000), and peptides of
differing lengths have also been reported to be generated by the
www.frontiersin.org May 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 123 | 7

Kendall and Feghali-Bostwick The roles of fibroblasts in fibrosis
matrix metalloproteases MMP-3, -7, -9, -13, or -20 (Heljasvaara
et al., 2005). Endostatin concentrations are greater in the blood
and lungs of patients with IPF and SSc, but these concentrations
do not seem to reach “therapeutic” levels (Hebbar et al., 2000;
Sumi et al., 2005; Richter et al., 2009). Interestingly, the amino ter￾minus portion of endostatin contains the anti-angiogenic func￾tionality (Tjin Tham Sjin et al., 2005), whereas the carboxy
terminus portion contains the antifibrotic activity, suggesting
that the two biological functions can be attributed to dissocia￾ble domains (Yamaguchi et al., 2012). Indeed, a 48 amino acid
portion of endostatin’s carboxy terminus has strong antifibrotic
actions in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo in human tissue (Yamaguchi
et al., 2012). This peptide ameliorates pulmonary and dermal
fibrosis in an animal model and ex vivo in human skin in response
to TGFβ (Yamaguchi et al., 2012).
VITAMIN D3
Vitamin D is important for regulating mineral absorption in the
intestines, calcium and phosphate concentrations in blood, and
for maintaining bone integrity. However, vitamin D deficiency
has also been found to correlate with many extra-osseous disor￾ders. Vitamin D3 is processed by the liver to form the biologically
active form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3).
1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 activates the vitamin D receptor (VDR,
a steroid hormone receptor) that heterodimerizes with retinoid
hormone receptor to directly regulate gene transcription. 1,25-
(OH)2 vitamin D3 inhibits the expression of type I collagen
in hepatic stellate cells (Potter et al., 2013). Furthermore, 1,25-
(OH)2 vitamin D3 has been observed to inhibit a fibrotic response
in human primary lung fibroblasts (Ramirez et al., 2010), and
1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 deficiency correlates with the severity of
liver fibrosis and that of SSc (Vacca et al., 2009; Caramaschi et al.,
2010; Rios Fernandez et al., 2010; Arnson et al., 2011; Slominski
et al., 2013). These studies suggest that the correction of vitamin
D deficiency is promising as a clinical strategy to alleviate fibrotic
disorders.
EPIGENETICS
Epigenetic changes in fibrosis are the subject of active investi￾gation. Several epigenetic modifications, like histone posttrans￾lational modifications and DNA methylation events, have been
reported. The fact that these epigenetic modifications do not alter
the DNA sequence suggests they are reversible, and as such, they
represent an attractive therapeutic strategy for countering fibro￾sis. Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) expression—a biosynthetic enzyme
for antifibrotic prostaglandin production—is suppressed in IPF
due to decreased histone acetylation (Coward et al., 2009), and
histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) activity mediates TGFβ stim￾ulated myofibroblast differentiation in a response that can be
inhibited by global inhibition of HDACs (Glenisson et al., 2007).
HDAC7 has been proposed as a potential target for the treat￾ment of SSc (Hemmatazad et al., 2009). DNA methylation of the
gene FLI1 coding for the ETS transcription factor Fli-1 inhibits its
genetic expression, resulting in enhanced collagen type 1 expres￾sion and persistent activation of fibroblasts in SSc (Wang et al.,
2006a). Primary fibroblasts isolated from the adventitial layer of
blood vessels following vascular injury maintain their activated,
pro-fibrotic state when grown in vitro (Li et al., 2011). The con￾stitutive activation is an imprinted phenotype maintained by
epigenetic alterations in key inflammatory and pro-fibrotic genes
(Li et al., 2011). Epigenetic drugs have been approved for cancer,
paving the way for using such agents, including DNA demethy￾lating agents, for other diseases. The reversibility of epigenetic
alterations and the ready availability of small molecule inhibitors
of these enzymes provide a potential future therapeutic strategy
that could antagonize the profibrotic phenotype of fibroblasts.
WNT-LIKE SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION PATHWAY
Wnt signaling and a classical Wnt-like intracellular signal trans￾duction pathway in fibrosis are a bustling area of research, and
multiple proteins within this pathway have been proposed as
druggable targets to prevent myofibroblast differentiation and
fibrosis. Wnt is a paradigm developmental signaling protein
that regulates proliferation, migration, and cell fate determina￾tion. Wnt ligands activate frizzled receptors—members of the G
protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily of proteins that
share common structure and function relationships—and pro￾mote the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β).
Interestingly, many other GPCRs such as the lysophosphatidic
acid receptor, the angiotensin type I receptor, the endothe￾lin 1 receptor, and CC and CXC chemokine receptors regu￾late myofibroblast differentiation and fibrosis. GPCRs have also
been demonstrated to couple to the Wnt-like intracellular sig￾nal transduction cascade Akt-GSK3β-βcatenin-PPARγ (Beaulieu
et al., 2004, 2005, 2008; Kendall et al., 2011). However, it is not
yet known if this cascade is the main contributor for GPCR￾regulation of myofibroblast transition and fibrosis. Regardless, it
is an interesting observation that multiple targets belonging to
this signaling pathway are currently being actively investigated as
potential targets for fibrosis therapies.
There is an apparent activation of the developmental Wnt￾βcatenin program in SSc (Bhattacharyya et al., 2012). Wnt acti￾vated βcatenin promotes fibroblast to myofibroblast transition in
human skin (Liu et al., 2012) and is required for TGFβ-mediated
fibrosis (Akhmetshina et al., 2012). While Akt is not required
for Wnt-stimulated catenin accumulation (Torres et al., 1999;
Chen et al., 2000), Akt has been implicated in sustaining the
Wnt signaling cascade (Fukumoto et al., 2001). Akt is a criti￾cal node of PI3K signaling and regulates cell cycle, cell growth,
and cell fate determination. PI3K-Akt signaling is also utilized
as a non-canonical pathway of TGF receptors that contribute to
fibrosis (Wan et al., 2013). Sustained Akt activation is critical for
upregulating αSMA expression and myofibroblast differentiation
in the wound healing response, implicating Akt as a potential
therapeutic target for fibrosis. Whereas a constitutively active
Akt1 protein (myr-Akt1) induces αSMA expression in fibrob￾lasts, a dominant negative Akt1 (Akt1 K179M) inhibits αSMA
expression (Abdalla et al., 2013). Akt is a ubiquitous kinase that
phosphorylates and inactivates the constitutive activity of GSK3β
(Fang et al., 2000). Knocking out GSK3β expression in fibroblasts
accelerates wound healing, increases fibrosis, enhances collagen
production, decreases cell apoptosis in wound sections, increases
profibrotic αSMA expression, and increases myofibroblast for￾mation (Kapoor et al., 2008). The transcriptional coregulator
Frontiers in Pharmacology | Inflammation Pharmacology May 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 123 | 8

Kendall and Feghali-Bostwick The roles of fibroblasts in fibrosis
βcatenin is required for the TGFβ-mediated inhibition of per￾oxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) expression in
hepatic stellate cells (Qian et al., 2012). PPARγ is a nuclear recep￾tor that is important for mesodermal cell fate determination.
PPARγ expression and activity promotes adipocyte differentia￾tion and inhibits fibroblast and hepatic stellate cell activation of
the profibrotic phenotype (Qian et al., 2012). PPARγ agonists
inhibit lung myofibroblast proliferation in vivo as well as TGFβ￾mediated myofibroblast differentiation and collagen production
in culture (Milam et al., 2008). PPARγ agonists also inhibit der￾mal fibrosis (Wei et al., 2010, 2012). Although only an associative
depiction of a pathway is characterized here from research on
individual proteins in this pathway, collectively they suggest that a
Wnt-like pathway could have a strong influence on myofibroblast
differentiation and fibrosis.
FIBROBLAST RECEPTORS
Caveolin 1 inhibits the function of the chemotactic receptor
CXCR4 in fibrocytes (Tourkina et al., 2011) and caveolin 1 is
down regulated in IPF (Wang et al., 2006b). The introduction
of a peptide containing the caveolin scaffolding domain of cave￾olin 1 is sufficient to inhibit fibrocyte accumulation in the lungs
in a bleomycin-induced animal model of fibrosis, suggesting that
the caveolin scaffolding domain could be employed as a poten￾tial therapy for SSc lung disease (Tourkina et al., 2011). In yet
another example, the single nucleotide polymorphism L412F in
the gene expressing Toll-like receptor 3 in pulmonary fibroblasts
has been found to correlate with a greater risk of mortality in
IPF patients (O’Dwyer et al., 2013). The L412F polymorphism
could be used as a biomarker for more progressive fibrotic dis￾ease, and the resulting loss of function of TLR3 is a potential
therapeutic target in IPF (O’Dwyer et al., 2013). This study high￾lights the importance of a personalized medicine approach to the
multifactorial group of fibrotic disorders. The inhibition of TLR4
has been reported to antagonize AngII-induced cardiac fibrosis
(Wang et al., 2014), the activity of TLR4 in hepatic stellate cells
enhances liver fibrosis (Seki et al., 2007), and the activity of TLR4
in skin fibroblasts enhances SSc (Bhattacharyya et al., 2013). Here,
the entanglement of inflammatory and ECM-producing func￾tions of fibroblasts can be exploited to improve fibrotic therapies
(Bhattacharyya et al., 2013).
Given the multifactorial etiology of various fibrotic disorders,
both in different tissues and within the same tissue (Murray et al.,
2012), the increasing interest in developing and employing per￾sonalized medicine, where a one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely
to be as effective, offers to accelerate the development of more
effective antifibrotic therapies for defined subsets of patients.
SUMMARY
Fibrosis is the thickening of ECM that is preceded by inflam￾mation or physical tissue injury. Fibroblasts are the principal
cell type that produces, maintains, and reabsorbs ECM. These
fibroblasts have the capacity to become activated by inflamma￾tory cytokines to myofibroblasts that display up-regulated cellular
migration, exaggerated ECM production, the endowment of a
contractile apparatus, and increased chemical signaling secretion
and responsiveness. Although various precursor cell types have
been observed to contribute to myofibroblast development, res￾ident fibroblast stromal cells appear to be the most significant
contributing source of myofibroblasts and the resulting tissue
fibrotic response in diseases such as SSc and IPF. Thus, fibroblasts
are a suitable therapeutic target. In view of the numerous fac￾tors at play in fibrosis, it is likely that combinatorial therapy that
includes targeting fibroblasts will be more effective than single
target approaches for the treatment of organ fibrosis.
