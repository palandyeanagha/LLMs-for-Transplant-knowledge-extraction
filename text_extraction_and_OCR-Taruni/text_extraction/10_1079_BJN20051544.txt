The aetiology of CVD is still not completely understood. The present review article summarises data supporting the hypothesis that an insufficient vitamin D
status may contribute to the worldwide high prevalence of CVD. Human vitamin D status primarily depends on skin exposure to the UVB spectrum of the
sunlight. Epidemiological data indicate that geographic latitude, altitude, season, and the place of residence (urban or rural) are associated with CVD mor￾tality. Interestingly, all these factors also have an influence on human UVB exposure and thus on vitamin D status. Several mechanisms might be responsible
for a protective role of vitamin D in CVD. These mechanisms include the inhibition of vascular smooth muscle proliferation, the suppression of vascular
calcification, the down regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the up regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines, and the action of vitamin D as a negative
endocrine regulator of the renin–angiotensin system. The first intervention trials indicate that vitamin D may suppress cardiovascular risk markers. How￾ever, more controlled clinical trials are needed to investigate whether optimal oral vitamin D supplementation is able to reduce CVD morbidity and
mortality.
Cardiovascular disease: Vitamin D: Parathyroid hormone: Inflammation: Cytokines
CVD is one of the major life-threatening diseases in Western
societies. For example, annual death rates in males and females
caused by CVD are 37 and 41 %, respectively in the USA and
40 and 52 %, respectively in Germany (Federal Statistical
Office, 2003). During the last few decades, CVD has emerged a
major cause of death worldwide. In 1990, the developing
countries contributed 63 % of world mortality due to CVD
(Murray & Lopez, 1997). In 2020, 76 % of an estimated 25
million deaths will occur in economically developing countries
(Yusuf et al. 2001).
Over the past five decades the prevalence of CVD has steadily
increased in many African countries, with hypertension as the
most common cause of CVD by far (Akinkugbe, 1990; Muna,
1993). The prevalence of hypertension has almost doubled in
Northern India as well over 30 years (Ahlawat et al. 2002). More￾over, it is estimated that by the year 2020 CHD will be the leading
cause of premature death in India whereof the urban Indians are
worst affected compared with the rural dwellers (Ramchandran
et al. 2001). In developing countries, unadjusted mortality of
IHD will be 120 % higher in women and 137 % in men in the
year 2020 compared with the year 1990 (Yusuf et al. 2001).
There is now general agreement that tobacco consumption,
elevated LDL-cholesterol levels, low HDL-cholesterol concen￾trations, high blood pressure and elevated blood glucose levels
are causally linked risk factors of CVD. Physical inactivity,
obesity, diet and low socio-economic status are thought to be
predisposing risk factors which work, at least in part, through
an impact on other risk factors that act directly. These factors
predispose to develop syndrome X, which is characterised by
obesity, hypertension, dyslipoproteinaemia, and disturbed glu￾cose tolerance. Recently, some evidence has been provided for
an association between syndrome X and its risk factors with a
low vitamin D status (Lind et al. 1995; Boucher, 1998; Chiu
et al. 2004). Some other factors such as elevated prothrombotic
factors, markers of infection and inflammation, elevated homo￾cysteine, elevated lipoprotein (a) and some psychological factors
show associations with CVD (Yusuf et al. 2001). Nevertheless,
the aetiology of CVD is far from clear (Yancy et al. 2003).
There are still several paradoxes in the pathogenesis of CVD
that cannot be sufficiently explained; the French paradox indi￾cates that mortality from CVD is relatively low in France despite
a high intake of saturated fatty acids (Renaud & de Lorgeril,
1992). The Italian paradox indicates that a population with a
high prevalence of cigarette smoking has a low CVD mortality
rate (Grimes et al. 2000). The Northern Ireland paradox indicates
that a population with a high incidence of CVD does not have
the expected risk indicators (Evans et al. 1995). The Albanian
paradox indicates that a population of low socio-economic
status has a low CVD mortality (Gjonca & Bobak, 1997). The
Indian paradox indicates that CVD mortality rate in urban popu￾lations is higher compared with rural populations despite a very
low fat intake (Singh et al. 1998). All these paradoxes support

the assumption that one or more important factors in the aetiol￾ogy of CVD are currently unknown.
There is increasing evidence that a low vitamin D status may be
an important and hitherto neglected factor in the pathogenesis of
CVD (see later). Therefore, the present review article summarises
data supporting the hypothesis that an insufficient vitamin D
status may contribute to the high and worldwide increasing preva￾lence of CVD.
Vitamin D physiology
Sunlight is the major provider of vitamin D for man. The UVB
spectrum of sunlight (290– 315 nm) induces skin synthesis of vita￾min D (Holick, 2002). Food is a second source of vitamin D, but
only a few foods such as eel, herring and salmon are good vitamin
D sources. They contain between 16 and 27 mg vitamin D per
100 g edible portion (Souci et al. 1994). Only in a few parts of
Europe are some foods such as margarine, vegetable oil, milk,
cereals, breakfast beverages and breads fortified with vitamin D
(Lips et al. 1996). They are usually enriched with not more
than 10mg vitamin D per 100 g edible portion. Over the counter
supplements can contain up to 25 mg vitamin D per tablet. Never￾theless, cutaneously synthesised vitamin D usually contributes
80– 90 % to human vitamin D supply (Glerup et al. 2000;
Heaney et al. 2003). Season, daytime, geographic latitude, and
altitude are important predictors of environmental UVB radiation
(Holick, 2002). Factors that influence environmental UVB radi￾ation can thus be used as vitamin D surrogates (Grant, 2003),
especially when large population groups with similar cultural
background and lifestyle are compared with each other.
In the human body, vitamin D is metabolised by a hepatic
hydroxylase into 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D). Circulating
25(OH)D is the hallmark for determining vitamin D status that is
deficiency, insufficiency, hypovitaminosis, adequacy, and toxicity
(Table 1). Deficiency is characterised by nutrient depletion that
leads to severe clinical symptoms. In the insufficient stage, patho￾physiological biochemical alterations can be observed. Severe
clinical signs are usually not present. Hypovitaminosis (or sub￾optimal nutrient supply) characterises a stage where the body
stores of a nutrient are already unphysiologically low. Only
minor functional alterations are seen in this stage. In the stage of
adequacy, no disturbances of the nutrient-dependent body func￾tions occur, while toxicity is due to nutrient-dependent adverse
reactions. 25(OH)D is metabolised by a renal 1a-hydroxylase
into the vitamin D hormone calcitriol (1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D).
This step is under control of parathyroid hormone (PTH).
However, PTH levels correlate better with 25(OH)D concen￾trations than they do with calcitriol (Zittermann et al. 2003).
Circulating calcitriol levels are usually homeostatically regulated.
Even vitamin D intoxication is associated with physiological
serum calcitriol levels (but with markedly elevated 25(OH)D
levels). Beside the kidney, calcitriol is also produced by local
1a-hydroxylases in various extra-renal tissues. Here, calcitriol
plays an important autocrine role which has been realised during
recent years. Local calcitriol production depends on the level of
circulating 25(OH)D. Vitamin D receptors have been identified
in several tissues, among them heart muscle cells and blood vessels
(Simpson & Weishaar, 1988; Davies & Hruska, 2001). Circulating
calcitriol is an important regulator of systemic Ca metabolism and
also of the intracellular Ca metabolism of various tissues. Calcitriol
is also known as a regulator of the cellular production of pro￾inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, a mechanism that
may be important in the prevention of CVD (see later).
Vitamin D and vascular calcification
Vascular calcification has been clearly defined as a risk factor for
cardiovascular mortality in the general population and is a fre￾quent finding in patients with CVD. Almost all angiographically
atherosclerotic lesions are calcified (Honye et al. 1992). The pre￾sence of Ca within coronary vasculature is associated with an
increased risk of myocardial infarction (Baedenkopf et al. 1964)
and poorer 5-year survival (Margolis et al. 1980). It has recently
been hypothesised that atherosclerotic plaque calcification is an
active, regulated process (Doherty & Detrano, 1994). In several
studies, a significant association has also been reported between
vascular calcification and osteoporosis (Dent et al. 1968; Fujita
et al. 1984; Banks et al. 1994; Barengolts et al. 1998). Data indi￾cate an inverse relationship between the amount of vascular and
skeletal Ca (Moon et al. 1992). The mechanism of this relation￾ship is largely unclear at present. In two human populations at
high and moderate risk for IHD, serum levels of the vitamin D
hormone calcitriol were inversely correlated with the extent of
vascular calcification (Watson et al. 1997). Although circulating
calcitriol levels are usually homeostatically regulated, there is evi￾dence from some epidemiological studies that low circulating
25(OH)D levels can obviously lead to low calcitriol levels (Bouil￾lon et al. 1987; Docio et al. 1998; Zittermann et al. 2000, 2003),
probably as a result of a substrate deficiency for the renal 1a￾hydroxylase. In addition, vitamin D supplementation has been
demonstrated to increase serum calcitriol levels (Pfeifer et al.
2001).
Several mechanisms might be responsible for a protective
effect of calcitriol on atherosclerotic lesions and vascular calci￾fication (Fig. 1). First, vascular smooth muscle cells express vita￾min D receptors. Calcitriol inhibits proliferation of these cells by
an acute influx of Ca into the cells (Davies & Hruska, 2001).
Second, matrix Gla protein has been shown to be a strong inhibi￾tor of vascular calcification (Schurgers et al. 2001). Matrix Gla
protein is synthesised by chondrocytes and vascular smooth
muscle cells (Luo et al. 1997; Shanahan & Weissberg, 1998).

Synthesis of the Matrix is rapidly and dramatically increased by
calcitriol (Fraser et al. 1988). Gla protein-deficient mice show
massive calcification of the main arteries and die within 8
weeks after birth due to rupture of the aorta (Luo et al. 1997).
Third, a lack of calcitriol results in an increase in serum PTH
levels. Excess PTH levels may at least in part promote CVD
by increased cardiac contractility, chronic atherosclerosis via
insulin resistance, Ca and phosphate deposition in vessel walls,
chronic myocardial calcification, and chronic heart valve calcifi￾cation (Rostand & Drueke, 1999). Fourth, experimental studies
have shown that calcitriol dose-dependently suppresses the
release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-a and IL-6
(Muller et al. 1992). There is now increasing evidence that
inflammatory processes play an important role in the develop￾ment of a vascular insult (Mendall et al. 1997; van Lente,
2000). IL-6 and TNF-a are chief physiological stimulants of
C-reactive protein (CRP), which can serve as an indicator of
inflammatory processes. In contrast to its effects on pro-inflam￾matory cytokines, calcitriol up regulates synthesis of the anti￾inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (Canning et al. 2001). Interestingly,
serum concentrations of IL-10 and 25(OH)D are both higher in
infants born during the summer half-year compared with infants
born during the winter half-year (Zittermann et al. 2004). IL-10
deficiency is associated with severe atherosclerosis in exper￾imental animals (Mallat et al. 1999). Fifth, calcitriol is a nega￾tive endocrine regulator of the renin –angiotensin system, in
fact, independently of Ca metabolism (Li et al. 2002). Neuro￾endocrine mechanisms such as the renin–angiotensin system
induce the progression of IHD. The renin –angiotensin system
plays a central role in the regulation of blood pressure, electro￾lyte, and volume homeostasis. Inappropriate stimulation of the
renin –angiotensin system has been associated with hypertension,
heart attack, and stroke. Calcitriol treatment reduces blood press￾ure, plasma renin activity, and angiotensin II levels (Kimura et al.
1999). Clinical studies have revealed an inverse relationship
between inadequate sunlight exposure or low serum levels of
calcitriol and blood pressure and/or plasma renin activity
(Kimura et al. 1999; Li et al. 2002). UVB radiation leading to
25(OH)D-serum concentrations .100 nmol/l was shown to
lower blood pressure in patients with mild essential hypertension
(Rostand, 1997; Krause et al. 1998). Moreover, supplementation
with vitamin D leads to a lower blood pressure as well (Pfeifer
et al. 2001).
Some may argue that high doses of oral vitamin D can induce
severe vascular calcification in animals (Spiess, 1932; Hass et al.
1958; Kent et al. 1958; Shi-Kuang et al. 1976; Atkinson et al.
1994). In animals, vitamin D is known to cause calcification of
the artery media in as little as 3 to 4 d (Takeo et al. 1989). How￾ever, in several of these animal studies, very high amounts of vita￾min D have been used (oral bolus of up to 7·5 – 12·5 mg vitamin D;
Takeo et al. 1989; Price et al. 2000). Mean oral vitamin D intake
in Western countries is currently only 3 – 5mg/d (Zittermann,
2003a). Recently performed controlled studies in human subjects
have demonstrated that vitamin D intakes up to 100mg/d do not
lead to hypercalcaemia and do not lead to circulating 25(OH)D
concentrations above 200 nmol/l (Heaney et al. 2003; Vieth
et al. 2004), a level that is regarded as safe (Table 1). In contrast,
available data indicate that a daily vitamin D intake of 1 mg/kg
body weight is necessary to achieve circulating 25(OH)D levels
of 100 nmol/l in the absence of skin exposure to UVB radiation
(Heaney et al. 2003; Zittermann, 2003b). Consequently, modern
adults are not consuming physiologically meaningful amounts
of vitamin D through foods or vitamin pills (Vieth, 2002). It
should also be mentioned that exposure of the human body to
the UVB spectrum of the sunlight cannot lead to vitamin D intoxi￾cation (Zittermann, 2003a). There is thus no risk for human adults
to develop vascular calcification as a result of vitamin D
intoxication.

Vitamin D and cardiovascular disease 485
https://doi.org/10.1079/BJN20051544 Published online by Cambridge University Press

Vascular calcification may not only be the result of intestinal
Ca hyperabsorption in combination with hypercalcaemia after
oral intake of supraphysiological dosages of vitamin D, but may
also occur as a result of an unphysiological mobilisation of skel￾etal Ca stores. However, no data are available that vascular calci￾fication, which occur in combination with osteoporotic Ca loss
from bone, is due to hypercalcaemia. Therefore, presently
unknown mechanisms may exist which may lead to vascular cal￾cification. Consequently, the above-mentioned animal studies do
not contradict the assumption that an insufficient vitamin D
status may promote vascular calcification. There is now increas￾ing evidence that the high prevalence of CVD in renal failure is
at least in part associated with low levels of vitamin D meta￾bolites. Patients with end-stage renal failure have an excess preva￾lence of coronary artery disease. Coronary artery disease is the
major factor in the pathogenesis of cardiac disease and accounts
for almost 50 % of deaths among end-stage renal disease patients
in the USA (Stack & Bloembergen, 2001). An elevated Ca £
PO4 product (.72) and high serum P concentrations (.65 mg/l)
significantly increase the mortality risk, most probably as a
result of cardiovascular complications (Block et al. 1998). In
renal failure, a disturbed vitamin D metabolism is a frequent find￾ing. When renal function impairs, the serum concentrations of cal￾citriol are reduced (Juttmann et al. 1981). Generally, there is an
association between the decrease in creatinine clearance and the
fall in serum calcitriol levels in patients with chronic renal failure
(Ishimura et al. 1999). Activity of renal 1a-hydroxylase is attenu￾ated in chronic renal failure due to phosphate load as well as to
the decreased number of viable nephrons (Fukagawa & Kuro￾kawa, 2005). There is also some evidence from clinical studies
that low 25(OH)D availability can contribute to the low calcitriol
levels in renal failure (Halloran et al. 1984). In chronic renal fail￾ure, the secretion of PTH is stimulated by several factors, primar￾ily hypocalcaemia and reduced production of calcitriol.
Moreover, resistance to physiological concentrations of calcitriol
may develop during the early phase of chronic renal failure
(Fukagawa & Kurokawa, 2005). Therefore, chronic renal failure
results in high circulating PTH levels (.6·8 pmol/l) caused by
secondary hyperparathyroidism (Rostand & Drueke, 1999;
Davies & Hruska, 2001). However, treatment of secondary hyper￾parathyroidism with vitamin D and Ca is often complicated in
these patients by hypercalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia.
Therefore, vitamin D analogues have been developed and have
been successfully used to treat these patients (Block et al. 2004).
In a recent review, several alterations which are associated with
vitamin D depletion, such as reduced cardiac inotrophy, enhanced
heart weight, increased myocardial collagen content, and
increased vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, have been
made responsible for the enhanced risk of CVD in chronic renal
failure (Rostand & Drueke, 1999). Moreover, it has been assumed
by these authors that the accompanying PTH excess may impair
intracellular Ca metabolism of the cardiomyocyte and may pro￾mote chronic atherosclerosis.
In line with the earlier experimental and observational studies
in renal failure, it has recently been demonstrated in a cohort
of Japanese end-stage renal disease patients that the use of
1a-hydroxyvitamin D3 was associated with a 70 % lower risk
of death from CVD when compared with a group of 1a-hydr￾oxyvitamin D3 non-users. The median intake of 1a-vitamin D
was 0·5 mg/d for a median follow-up of 61 months (Shoji et al.
2004).
Epidemiological data on cardiovascular disease and vitamin D
surrogates
Geographic latitude and cardiovascular disease
Fig. 2 shows the relationship between death rates from IHD and
geographic latitude in males and females from different European
countries. Geographic latitude of the countries were adopted from
Grimes et al. (2000) and IHD death rates were obtained from the
Global Cardiovascular Infobase of the WHO Collaborating Centre
on Surveillance of CVD (Global Cardiovascular Infobase, 2003).
Data indicate an increase in IHD with the increase in geographic
latitude. Fleck (1989) has reported a similar correlation coeffi￾cient (r 0·58) between IHD mortality rate of males and
geographic latitude for several European and Western countries.
Data are in gross agreement with the observation that environ￾mental UVB radiation is absent from November until February
at the geographic latitude of 408N and from October until
March at the geographic latitude of 508N or 608N, while there
is environmental UVB radiation throughout the year at the geo￾graphic latitude of 308N or closer to the equator (Holick, 2002).
Moreover, available data from America and Europe indicate

that the winter values of serum 25(OH)D are higher in healthy
subjects who live at lower latitudes compared with subjects
living at higher latitudes (Fig. 3). The data in Fig. 3 show an
inverse association (r 20·68; P,0·01) between latitude and
serum 25(OH)D levels. Further evidence for a causal link between
a latitude-associated risk factor such as vitamin D and CVD
comes from the British Regional Heart Study, a prospective
investigation of IHD among 7735 men aged 40 –59 years
(Elford et al. 1989). This study has demonstrated a two-fold
higher risk of a major IHD event per 1000 men per year in Scot￾land compared with the South of England, while those men
recruited in the Midlands, Wales and the North of England experi￾enced intermediate rates. This geographic gradient was also found
for internal and international immigrants, indicating that the place
of residence was a more important determinant of the risk of a
major IHD event than the place of birth.
Altitude and cardiovascular disease
Mortimer et al. (1977) have shown a serial decline in mortality
from IHD for males in the US state New Mexico with higher
altitudes. An increase of 1000 m (3280 feet) in the altitude of
residence was associated with a 28 % decrease in IHD mortality
rates. Moreover, a statistical evaluation of different areas of the
USA revealed an inverse association in death rates from IHD
with altitude for men and women (Gordan & Danner, 1977).
According to sex and age group, correlation coefficients for
death rates with altitude were between 20·209 and 20·375
(P¼0·001– 0·0014). Associations were lowest in middle-aged
females and were highest in elderly men. It is well known that
intensity of UVB increases exponentially with altitude. The
increase is 4 % per 305 m (1000 feet) at an altitude close to sea
level and is 8 – 10 % per 305 m (1000 feet) at an altitude above
2420 m (8000 feet). In early spring, UVB intensity at sea level
is only 60 % UVB intensity at an altitude of 2580 m (8500
feet), indicating that skin synthesis of vitamin D can be more
effective in late winter (and probably also in late autumn) at
higher altitude compared with sea level (Rigel et al. 1999). In
line with altitude-associated IHD mortality rates in the USA, rela￾tively low mortality rates of IHD have also been reported for sub￾jects living in Alpine European regions of high altitude (Scragg,
1981). Interestingly, hypertension is also less common or less
severe at higher altitudes (Hultgren, 1970). Controlled clinical
studies have demonstrated that regular exposure to UVB radiation
but not to UVA radiation increases circulating 25(OH)D above a
level of 100 nmol/l and also significantly reduces blood pressure
by approximately 6 mmHg in hypertensive patients within an
intervention period of 6 weeks (Krause et al. 1998).
Seasonality of cardiovascular disease
Some studies have evaluated the effect of season on CVD deaths.
In Scotland, IHD mortality rates showed a nadir in summer (Dou￾glas et al. 1991). Scottish death rates of IHD in summer were
approximately 30 % lower compared with winter (Douglas et al.
1991). Moreover, a large evaluation of all IHD deaths in Scotland
between 1962 and 1971 also showed a winter peak and a summer
nadir in male and female IHD deaths (Douglas et al. 1995).
Grimes et al. (1996), using data from the 1992 National British
Household Survey, found an inverse correlation of 20·85
(P,0·001) between sunshine per year and IHD death rate per
100 000 males within the seventeen regions of that study.
When the data were evaluated according to the 200 districts of
that study, the correlation coefficient was 20·59 (P,0·001)
between sunshine per year and IHD death rate per 100 000
males. The reported data fit well together with results on vitamin
D status of healthy subjects living at geographic latitudes between
408N and 608N, for instance in North America and Europe. These
subjects have seasonal fluctuations in circulating 25(OH)D levels.
Concentrations of 25(OH)D are higher in summer than in winter
(Fig. 4). Moreover, data indicate that in many Western countries a
large part of the population have 25(OH)D levels in the insuffi￾ciency range (,50 nmol/l), especially during wintertime. Some
epidemiological studies have also demonstrated seasonal vari￾ations for circulating calcitriol levels in children and young
adults with a peak in summer and a nadir in winter (Docio et al.
1998; Zittermann et al. 1998).
Seasonality of CVD has also been observed in the Southern
hemisphere. An Australian study has demonstrated that coronary
events were 20 – 40 % more likely to occur in winter and spring
than at other times of the year (Enquselassie et al. 1993). In
some of the earlier studies lower temperature was associated
with coronary death. It should be mentioned, however, that
mean annual temperatures are also low in Alpine regions of rela￾tively low IHD mortality, indicating that ambient temperature is
not a major factor in the pathogenesis of CVD. More than two
decades ago, Scragg (1981, 1982) had already suggested that sea￾sonal variations in UVB radiation and in body levels of vitamin D
are responsible for the seasonality of CVD. Recently, a circa￾annual rhythm has been described not only for serum 25(OH)D
concentrations but also for serum PTH levels in Central Europe

(Woitge et al. 2000). The investigators could also demonstrate
that a daily vitamin D supplement of 12·5 mg was able to blunt
the PTH peak in winter during the second year of that study. In
the supplemented group, the rhythm-adjusted annual mean PTH
levels fell by approximately 12 % during the second study year,
but remained unchanged in a control group (Meier et al. 2004).
Interestingly, high PTH levels are a risk factor for IHD in the gen￾eral population. In a Norwegian study, the highest PTH quartile
(.3·50 pmol/l in men and .3·30 pmol/l in women) predicted
IHD, with odds ratios of 1·70 for men and 1·73 for women, v.
the lowest PTH quartile (,1·90 pmol/l for men and
,1·80 pmol/l for women) (Kamycheva et al. 2004). Recently per￾formed investigations have demonstrated that 25(OH)D is the
major predictor of serum PTH levels in healthy adults (Pepe
et al. 2005). Moreover, no cases of secondary hyperparathyroid￾ism (PTH levels .6·8 pmol/l) are seen in elderly subjects with
25(OH)D levels above 100 nmol/l (Gomez-Alonso et al. 2003).
Keeping in mind that insufficient 25(OH)D levels can lead to
hyperparathyroidism and that local calcitriol production depends
on circulating 25(OH)D levels, it is interesting that high PTH
levels induce IL-6 production (Mitnick et al. 2001), whereas
low calcitriol concentrations induce synthesis of IL-6 and TNF￾a (Muller et al. 1992). These two cytokines are the chief physio￾logical stimulants of the hepatic production of acute-phase reac￾tants such as fibrinogen and CRP (Heinrich et al. 1990). Higher
blood pressure, an enhanced blood viscosity, increased fibrinogen
levels, and higher CRP levels can all contribute to the increased
risk of CVD in winter compared with summer (Frohlich et al.
1997; Mendall et al. 1997; Crawford et al. 2000; Mavri et al.
2001). Thus, a decreased vitamin D production leading to high
PTH levels might at least in part be responsible for the winter￾time increases in fibrinogen and CRP, which are both important
cardiovascular risk factors (Ridker et al. 2000).
Urban and rural differences in cardiovascular disease
Urbanisation is associated with an increased mortality from IHD
(Enterline et al. 1960). The prevalence of risk factors for
CVD and also of disease rates is higher in urban than in rural
communities in India (Gupta et al. 1996, 1997) and China
(Anonymous, 1992). Moreover, studies in African countries
have shown that coronary artery disease is more prevalent in
urban than in rural dwellers (Muna, 1993). In addition, a
study in South America demonstrated that among isolated
island dwellers, hypertension was not detectable and blood
pressure was comparable in 60- and 20 – 30-year-old subjects
whereas the prevalence of hypertension was 10·7 % in the
urban population, and exceeded 45 % in those subjects over
60 years of age (Hollenberg et al. 1997).
As mentioned earlier, IHD mortality will increase by 120–
137 % in developing countries from 1990 until 2020. This
increase is paralleled by a doubling of the percentage of individ￾uals living in urban settings (Yusuf et al. 2001). It is well known
that low environmental UVB irradiation due to urbanisation was a
major risk factor for severe vitamin D deficiency in infants during
the 18th and 19th centuries in North America and Europe. At the
turn of the 20th century, for example, rickets was rampant among
the poor children living in the industrialised and polluted northern
cities of the USA (Rajakumar, 2003). This problem has disap￾peared in the 20th century by regular supplementation of infants
with vitamin D and/or with the exposure of children to artificial
UVB irradiation. It is important to mention that at latitudes of
approximately 25 – 608 North or South, synthesis of vitamin D
is only possible between 10.00 hours and 18.00 hours, with a
maximal capacity at 12.00– 14.00 hours (Holick, 2002). There￾fore, low outdoor activities of urban children and adults during
the daytime can increase the risk of developing vitamin D insuf￾ficiency or even deficiency. Indeed, there is evidence that vitamin
D levels are markedly lower in individuals working indoors,
characterised by a sedentary lifestyle and spending most of their
leisure-time activity at home compared with those working out￾side such as farmers and spending much time doing outdoor
activities (Chapuy et al. 1996). In a recent European study,
middle-aged urban dwellers had only modest seasonal variations
in circulating 25(OH)D levels and a high percentage of subjects
had low vitamin D status throughout the year, despite marked sea￾sonal fluctuations in daily sunshine (Bhattoa et al. 2004). The
prevalence of 25(OH)D levels below 50 nmol/l during spring,
summer, autumn, and winter was 71, 46·3, 49·4, and 56·7 %,
respectively. Even in a sunny country such as Lebanon, low
25(OH)D levels (,25 nmol/l) were observed in 72·8 % of a
middle-aged group of adults. In a multiple linear regression
analysis, circulating 25(OH)D levels were inversely related to
urban dwelling in the group of male adults (r 20·57;
P,0·001). This association was weaker in female adults (r
20·27; P¼0·002), whereas inadequate vitamin D intake and the
style of clothing were more important than urban or rural dwell￾ing (Gannage-Yared et al. 2000). Very low mean 25(OH)D levels
of 8 nmol/l in winter and 18 nmol/l in summer were observed in
Indian physicians and nurses who lived in the city of Delhi and
had a daily sun exposure of only 25 min. In contrast, Indian sol￾diers with a daily sun exposure of 370 min had a mean 25(OH)D
level of 47 nmol/l in winter (Goswami et al. 2000).
Many cities in developing countries are highly polluted. A
higher degree of air pollution that contains ozone also leads to
an efficient atmospheric absorption of UVB photons, thereby
reducing the skin photosynthesis of vitamin D (Holick, 1995;
Mims, 1996). For example, Delhi is one of the most polluted
cities in the world. Children living in a downtown area of Delhi
have significantly lower mean 25(OH)D concentrations than
Fig. 4. Mean circulating concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in newborns
(X–X), children (B–B), adolescents (D–D), adults (A–A), elderly subjects
(W–W) and a mixed group of adolescents and adults (O–O) according to
season (Vik et al. 1980; Zittermann, 1987; Hegarty et al. 1994; Docio et al.
1998; Zittermann et al. 1998, 2004; Davies et al. 1999; Lehtonen-Veromaa
et al. 1999; Vieth et al. 2001; Rucker et al. 2002; Tangpricha et al. 2002).
488 A. Zittermann et al.

those living in less polluted area on the outskirts of the city (29 v.
68 nmol/1; Agarwal et al. 2002). Interestingly, Indians from urban
slums and also from an urban middle-class residential area have
markedly higher circulating levels of IL-6 and TNF-a than rural
village populations (Yudkin et al. 1999).
Intervention trials with vitamin D
Some supplementation studies with vitamin D have been per￾formed where cardiovascular risk markers have been assessed.
In a study of Scragg et al. (1995) using a single oral dose of
2·5 mg vitamin D3 given in the winter to elderly individuals
re-studied at about 5 weeks later in January and February,
neither blood pressure nor serum cholesterol concentrations
were altered. In that study, the increase of the serum 25(OH)D
levels was only 18 nmol/l. The study of Timms et al. (2002)
was designed to compare 3-monthly injections of a depot sol￾ution of cholecalciferol at high (1250 mg) or low (12·5 mg)
dosage on serum CRP levels over 1 year. The dosages were
equivalent to approximately 14mg and 0·14mg vitamin D
daily. Initial 25(OH)D levels were 21·8 nmol/l in the high-dose
vitamin D group and 20·7 nmol/l in the low-dose vitamin D
group. Mean CRP levels decreased by 40 % in the high-dose
vitamin D group and by only 5 % in the low-dose vitamin D
group. The mean increase in serum 25(OH)D levels during the
study period was, however, very similar in both groups (16·7
and 12·3 nmol/l), indicating that changes in serum 25(OH)D
levels could not solely be responsible for the markedly decreased
circulating CRP levels in the high-dose vitamin D group. In a
study of van den Berghe et al. (2003), patients with prolonged
critical illness received different amounts of vitamin D during
the first 10 d after intensive care unit admission (5·5 v.
12·0mg daily). Initial 25(OH)D levels of patients at intensive
care admission were 27·3 nmol/l. Serum concentrations of
25(OH)D in the high-dose vitamin D group were higher than
in the low-dose group only on days 2, 6 and 7 (approximately
5 nmol/l). Elevated CRP levels decreased significantly with
time in the intensive care unit in both study groups. However,
the fall in CRP was significantly more pronounced in the high￾dose vitamin D group, compared with the low-dose group
between days 3 and 7. Likewise, IL-6 levels decreased in the
high-dose vitamin D group, whereas they remained unaltered
in the low-dose group. In a study of Pfeifer et al. (2001), elderly
women were supplemented with Ca and 20mg vitamin D daily
or with Ca alone. Initial 25(OH)D levels in the two study
groups were 24·6 and 25·7 nmol/l, respectively. Compared with
Ca, supplementation with vitamin D and Ca resulted in an
increase in serum 25(OH)D of 72 % (P,0·01), a decrease in
serum PTH of 17 % (P,0·05), a decrease in systolic blood
pressure of 9·3 % (P,0·025), and a decrease in heart rate of
5·4 % (P,0·025).
Conclusions
The aetiology of CVD is still not completely understood. Epide￾miological data indicate that geographic latitude, altitude,
season, and the place of residence (rural or urban) are all associ￾ated with CVD mortality. Until now, no sufficient explanations
for a common origin of these associations were available. How￾ever, all these environmental factors share the common possession
that they have an influence on human UVB exposure and therefore
also on human vitamin D status. Moreover, the vitamin D hypoth￾esis of the aetiology of CVD is in line with the high prevalence of
CVD in obese and elderly individuals and the low prevalence of
CVD in physically active individuals, since vitamin D status is
inversely related to body weight (Wortsman et al. 2000; Arunabh
et al. 2003) and age (McKenna, 1992; Passeri et al. 2003), and is
positively related to the level of physical activity (Zittermann et al.
2000). There are several mechanisms that might explain the
association between vitamin D status and CVD, among them an
effect of vitamin D on inflammation markers. The first interven￾tion trials indicate that oral vitamin D supplementation may be
able to improve inflammation parameters.
Recently, it has been stated that for the defence of chronic ill￾nesses, such as CVD, urban planning for health needs to be
strengthened, and that cities and towns should be turned into
safe places for pedestrians, cyclists, and children in order to
encourage regular physical activity (Anonymous, 2004). This rec￾ommendation is exactly what is also necessary to improve vitamin
D status of urban dwellers. Nevertheless, it is questionable
whether all individuals who are at risk for low UVB exposure
such as indoor workers, veiled women, and elderly individuals
are able to adequately increase their skin synthesis of vitamin
D. Therefore, it is necessary to provide optimal amounts of oral
vitamin D to these groups. Intakes that are needed to maintain
adequate circulating 25(OH)D levels range between 50 and
100mg daily (Heaney et al. 2003; Vieth et al. 2004) and can
only be achieved by supplementation or food fortification.
Some of the above-mentioned earlier vitamin D studies on
serum cytokines have used dosages which were not adequate to
achieve physiological circulating 25(OH)D levels. In future,
more controlled clinical trials are needed to investigate whether
optimal oral vitamin D supplementation is able to reduce cardio￾vascular risk markers and CVD mortality.
