Abstract
The data were presented in abstract form at the 45th meeting of the American Society of Nephrology, October 30-
November 04 2012, San Diego, CA, USA. Circulating autoantibodies against M-type phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) are
important pathogenic antibodies of idiopathic membranous nephropathy (MN) in adults. However, previous studies on the
clinical impact of anti-PLA2R antibodies demonstrated several limitations, including insufficient numbers of study subjects
and different time points and methods for anti-PLA2R antibody measurement. To verify the clinical significance of anti￾PLA2R antibodies in Korean patients with MN, we measured autoantibodies in serum samples obtained at the time of biopsy
from a total of 100 patients with idiopathic MN who had not yet received immunosuppressive treatment. We detected anti￾PLA2R antibody in 69 patients, and we observed that autoantibody reactivity reflected the severity of disease activity.
Proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia were more severe in patients with anti-PLA2R than in those without the autoantibodies
(2.95 g/g vs. 6.85 g/g, P = 0.003; 3.1 g/dL vs. 2.5 g/dL, P = 0.004, respectively). Additionally, the clinical severities worsened
proportionally as the levels of anti-PLA2R antibodies increased (P = 0.015 and P for trend ,0.001 for proteinuria and
hypoalbuminemia, respectively). However, neither the levels nor the presence or absence of anti-PLA2R antibody showed a
significant correlation with clinical outcomes, such as remission rate and time to remission. In conclusion, we observed that
anti-PLA2R antibodies are highly prevalent in Korean patients with idiopathic MN and that they reflect the clinical disease
activity before the administration of immunosuppressive treatment. However, the levels of anti-PLA2R antibody at the time
of kidney biopsy may not predict the clinical outcomes in current clinical practice.

Introduction
Membranous nephropathy (MN) constitutes a major glomeru￾lonephritis that causes nephrotic syndrome in adults [1]. The in
situ formation of immune complexes in the subepithelial space of
the glomerular basement membrane is the distinct pathologic
feature of MN [2,3,4]. Recently, M-type phospholipase A2
receptor (PLA2R) was identified as the target antigen of
autoantibodies in adults with idiopathic MN [5]. Several studies
have reported that autoantibodies against PLA2R not only have a
direct pathogenic role but also serve as sensitive and specific
markers for idiopathic MN [5,6,7,8,9]. However, there have been
discrepancies in results regarding the relationship between anti￾PLA2R levels and the clinical presentation [6,7,8,10,11]. There
may be several reasons for these discrepancies. First, previous
studies have reported that the time point of anti-PLA2R
measurement was different [5,7,11]. Comparing data measured
at different stages of MN could lead to an inappropriate
interpretation. Second, the methods for detecting and titrating
anti-PLA2R were different among the studies [6,8,11]. Third, most
of the previous studies did not include a sufficient number of
patients [5,6,8]. Additionally, the correlation between autoanti￾bodies and the clinical status had not been thoroughly investigated
in Asian patients with MN, despite the hypothesis that race or
ethnic background might be associated with the incidence or
prognosis of the disease [12,13,14,15,16].
In our study, we measured anti-PLA2R levels at the time of
kidney biopsy in a large number of patients with idiopathic MN
who had not received immunosuppressive treatment before kidney
biopsy, and we explored the relationship between anti-PLA2R and
disease activity and clinical outcomes.
Materials and Methods
Study subjects and serum samples
We conducted our study with the approval of the institutional
review boards of Seoul National University Hospital and Yonsei
University Severance Hospital in Seoul, Korea. All of the
participants provided their written informed consent according
to the Declaration of Helsinki. The ethics committees of Seoul
National University Hospital and Yonsei University Severance
Hospital approved this study. We evaluated MN patients with
biopsy-proven MN who were diagnosed between 2002 and 2011.
In this study, we included 100 idiopathic and 9 secondary MN
patients whose serum samples were collected at the time of kidney
biopsy. To compare the prevalence of anti-PLA2R between

patients with active-phase MN and patients in remission, we
included 19 additional patients with idiopathic MN who had
entered remission. Additionally, we used serum specimens from 14
healthy volunteers as normal controls.
We confirmed the diagnosis of idiopathic MN by histologic
findings, including subepithelial electron-dense deposits on elec￾tron microscopy and a diffuse granular pattern of IgG and C3
staining on immunofluorescence microscopy. We diagnosed
secondary MN in patients who had a suggestive cause of MN,
including hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), lupus,
and malignancy, with comparable pathologic features of MN.
Clinical data
We collected the clinical information on disease severity,
treatment, remission, and relapse by reviewing the subjects’
medical records. We categorized our subjects into three groups
according to their risk for disease progression based on clinical
characteristics [17,18,19]. Low risk was defined as urine protein￾creatinine ratio (uPCR) less than 4.0 g/g and estimated glomer￾ular filtration rate (eGFR) $60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (calculated
using the original Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation
[20], which is most commonly used and validated in Koreans
[21]). Moderate and high-risk patients had uPCR between 4.0–
8.0 g/g and eGFR $60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and uPCR exceeding
8 g/g and impaired renal function (eGFR,60 mL/min/1.73 m2
),
respectively. Remission was defined as proteinuria reduction of
50% or greater from baseline and uPCR less than 3.5 g/g.
Relapse was defined as uPCR .3.5 g/g after some period of
remission.
Human glomerular extracts
Normal renal cortexes, which were part of the radical
nephrectomy specimens from patients with renal cell carcinoma,
were obtained with institutional review board approval. We
extracted human glomerular protein as previously described [5].
We isolated the glomeruli from the kidney with graded sieving,
using 100-, 125-, and 150-mm-sized meshes. The glomerular pellet
was homogenized in an equal volume of RIPA buffer (150 mM
NaCl, 1% Triton- X-100, 1% deoxicholic acid sodium salt, 0.1%
SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA; GenDEPOT,
Barker, TX, USA) with complete protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA) on ice. The
glomerular homogenate was centrifuged twice at 12,000 rpm for
20 minutes at 4uC, and the supernatant was isolated. To remove
the contaminating human IgG, we incubated the human
glomerular extracts (HGEs) with Pure down Protein G-Agarose
(GenDEPOT, Barker, TX, USA). We proved that we had
removed contaminating human IgG by confirming that there
was no detectable band in immunoblotting with anti-human IgG.
Western blotting
Equal amounts of HGEs were loaded onto 6% SDS-polyacryl￾amide gels (PAGE) under nonreducing conditions and transferred
to Immobilon-FL 0.4 mM polyvinylidene difluoride membranes
(Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). Membranes were incubated in
5% blocking buffer containing 2% bovine serum albumin, and
human serum was initially used at a dilution of 1:100 as the
primary Ab. For samples with negative results at a dilution of
1:100, we performed western blotting at a dilution of 1:25 and
confirmed non-reactivity based on the negative results with the
higher concentration of Ab. The serum samples with positive
results were retested at gradually increased dilutions up to 1:8000.
Sheep anti-human IgG4 (The Binding Site, Birmingham, UK)
antibodies were used as a secondary Ab at a dilution of 1:3000,
followed by peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-sheep IgG (The
Binding Site, Birmingham, UK) antibodies as the detecting Ab at a
dilution of 1:10000. A goat polyclonal Ab against PLA2R (Sigma￾Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used at a dilution of 1:400 to
confirm the location of the PLA2R band. The membranes were
incubated with chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce ECL Plus
Western Blotting Substrate, Thermo, Rockford, IL, USA) for
1 minute and exposed to HyBlot CL autoradiography film
(Denville Scientific, Inc. Metuchen, NJ, USA). The exposure
times were typically 30 to 60 seconds for positive bands, and
extended up to 10 minutes for weak or negative bands. The
labeled proteins were detected by the enhanced chemilumines￾cence system (ECLTM PRN 2106; Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK). To explore the correlation
between clinical status severity and anti-PLA2R levels, we
categorized the patients into 4 groups according to anti-PLA2R
levels. Group 1 (Negative) included patients without anti-PLA2R,
and group 2 (1:100 (+)) included patients whose serum samples
reacted with PLA2R at a dilution of 1:100. Patients whose serum
reacted with PLA2R at increased dilutions up to 1:2000 were
categorized in group 3 (1:2000 (++)), and the other patients with
positive results between 1:2000 and 1:8000 dilution were
categorized as group 4 (1:8000 (+++)).
Statistical analysis
For data description, continuous variables with symmetric
distribution were presented as the mean6SD, and non-normally
distributed variables were expressed as medians (25–75% inter￾quartile range). Student’s t- test and analysis of variance (ANOVA)
were used for parametric analysis, and ANOVA with polynomial
contrast was performed for a trend analysis. The Mann-Whitney
U test and Kruskall-Wallis test were used for nonparametric
analysis. The Dunn method was performed for multiple compar￾isons in nonparametric analysis. Categorical variables were
described as frequencies or percentages, and the data were
analyzed with x2 tests. The four groups were compared using the
Mantel-Haenszel x2 tests for dichotomized variables. All of the
statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS, version 19.0
(Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Clinical characteristics of idiopathic MN
Table 1 shows the clinical characteristics of idiopathic MN
patients at the time of kidney biopsy. The average age was
54.7613.9 years. The mean serum creatinine and eGFR were
0.9160.35 mg/dL and 90628 mL/min/1.73 m2
, respectively.
The mean serum albumin level was 2.760.7 g/dL, and the
median uPCR was 6.07 g/g. None of the patients received
immunosuppressive treatment before kidney biopsy.
Prevalence of anti-PLA2R
We examined anti-PLA2R reactivity with western blotting and
confirmed the presence of a 185 kD protein band using native
antibody (Ab) against human PLA2R Ab and serum samples from
patients with MN (Figure 1). A total of 69 of 100 patients with
idiopathic MN had autoantibodies against PLA2R at the time of
kidney biopsy. The prevalence of anti-PLA2R was 80.0% (60 of
75) in patients with idiopathic MN and nephrotic range
proteinuria at the time of biopsy. The autoantibody was not
detected in any of the healthy control subjects (n = 14) (data not
shown).
We compared anti-PLA2R reactivity between patients at the
time of kidney biopsy (n = 100) and another subset of patients in

remission after treatment (n = 19). Whereas a large number of
patients with idiopathic MN had autoantibodies against PLA2R at
the time of diagnosis, the prevalence of anti-PLA2R reactivity was
lower (15.8% vs. 69.0%) in patients who went into remission after
treatment.
The causes of secondary MN were HBV (n = 6), HCV (n = 1),
malignancy (n = 2), and systemic lupus erythematosus (n = 1). Anti￾PLA2R reactivity was considerably lower in patients with
secondary MN compared with patients with idiopathic MN.
Two patients (1 with HBV and 1 with malignancy) showed
reactivity against PLA2R. Immunostaining for IgG4 was observed
in both patients with anti-PLA2R reactivity but it was not present
in patients with secondary MN without anti-PLA2R, except in one
patient who showed equivocal IgG4 staining (Table 2).
Relationship between clinical status and anti-PLA2R
reactivity/levels
In patients with idiopathic MN, we found significant correla￾tions between anti-PLA2R reactivity and clinical parameters,
including serum albumin and proteinuria (Table 1). Proteinuria
was more severe in patients with anti-PLA2R compared with those
patients without anti-PLA2R (uPCR, 6.85 g/g vs. 2.95 g/g,
P = 0.003). The initial serum albumin levels were significantly
lower in patients with anti-PLA2R than in patients without anti￾PLA2R (2.5 g/dL vs. 3.1 g/dL, P = 0.004). The proportion of
patients with nephrotic range proteinuria was significantly higher
in the anti-PLA2R-positive group than in the negative group
(87.0% vs. 48.4%, P,0.001). However, there was no significant
difference in renal function between the groups.
To investigate whether clinical disease activities were correlated
with quantitative levels of anti-PLA2R, we compared clinical
parameters among groups categorized by anti-PLA2R levels. As
indicated in Figure 2, proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia became
more severe as the anti-PLA2R levels increased. The proportion of
patients with nephrotic range proteinuria increased gradually as
the anti-PLA2R levels increased. Moreover, there was a significant
difference in the proportion of groups stratified by risk for disease
progression (Figure 3). The proportion of the high-risk group was
the most dominant in the group with the highest anti-PLA2R
levels, and the reverse was observed in the lowest group.

Relationship between clinical outcomes and anti-PLA2R
reactivity/levels
To address whether anti-PLA2R could predict the clinical
outcomes of patients with idiopathic MN, we analyzed the clinical
data of 77 of the 100 patients with idiopathic MN who had been
followed up after kidney biopsy and had available clinical
information, including details on treatment response and relapse.
There has been no patient, in whom an initial diagnosis of
idiopathic MN was reclassified as secondary MN as a result of the
belated development of a secondary cause, such as malignancy
during the follow-up period. The median follow-up time was
30 months, and 67.5% of the patients received immunosuppres￾sive treatment (Table 3). There was no significant difference in the
rate of receiving immunosuppressive treatment between the anti￾PLA2R positive and negative groups. The second-line therapy was
used in 4 patients, 2 of them went into remission after
administration of second-line therapy. During the treatment, 6
patients developed steroid-induced. Additionally, in the majority
of cases, infections comprised the clinically significant adverse
reactions associated with immunosuppressive drugs; 5 patients
received hospital treatment for severe infection, and one patient
stopped immunosuppressive therapy because of a severe recurring
infection. A total of 81.8% patients entered remission, and the
median time to remission was 2.0 months. However, neither the
remission rate nor the time to remission was significantly different
between patients with and without anti-PLA2R. Furthermore,
these clinical outcomes were not different among groups with
different levels of anti-PLA2R (Table 4). Additionally, during the

follow-up period, two patients reached doubling of serum
creatinine levels compared to baseline, and one patient had a
high titer of anti-PLA2R and the other exhibited a negative anti￾PLA2R reactivity. Only one patient without anti-PLA2R pro￾gressed to end-stage renal disease.
Changes in anti-PLA2R reactivity in follow-up samples
To investigate whether anti-PLA2R reactivity was different
according to the disease activity, we conducted a longitudinal
analysis in a subset of 10 of 100 patients with idiopathic MN with
available follow-up serum samples and clinical information. Four
of 6 patients who had autoantibodies at the time of kidney biopsy
went into remission, and the autoantibodies disappeared in 3 of
the 4 patients in remission. However, anti-PLA2R Abs were
persistent in patients who did not go into remission. The anti￾PLA2R reactivity continued to be negative, regardless of remission
status, in all 4 patients who had no autoantibodies at the time of
kidney biopsy (Table 5).
Discussion
We explored the presence of anti-PLA2R in Korean patients
with idiopathic MN using western blotting, and we demonstrated
that 69% of patients had anti-PLA2R antibodies in their serum.
Additionally, the prevalence of anti-PLA2R reactivity was 80.0%
in patients with idiopathic MN and nephrotic range proteinuria.
This finding is in agreement with previous reports on patients who
had idiopathic MN and were of different races and ethnicities
[5,6,7,11]. Although anti-PLA2R is a specific marker for idiopathic
MN, autoantibodies were detected in 2 of 9 patients with
secondary MN in this study. However, predominant glomerular
IgG4 deposition, which is a characteristic feature of idiopathic MN
[5,22,23,24], was only detected in 2 patients with anti-PLA2R,
suggesting that idiopathic MN and hepatitis B or malignancy may
occur coincidentally in these patients.
Our study also demonstrated that anti-PLA2R reflects disease
activity in idiopathic MN. The prevalence of anti-PLA2R in
patients who were diagnosed with idiopathic MN and had not yet
received immunosuppressive treatment was higher than in those
who had already gone into remission. Additionally, anti-PLA2R
detected at the time of initial diagnosis disappeared when the
patients entered remission, although autoantibodies were still
persistently detected in patients who did not go into remission.
Moreover, anti-PLA2R levels were in direct proportion to the
initial clinical values of serum albumin levels and proteinuria.
Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that anti￾PLA2R is essential to trigger the disease and reflects disease
activity. Although similar results have been reported in previous
studies [5,6], controversy remains about the relationship between
anti-PLA2R reactivity and disease activity because one study
showed discrepant results [11]. This debate is derived from several
limitations of previous studies. These studies included a small
number of patients and different time points between kidney
biopsy and serum sampling, and all of these studies were
conducted on Caucasians. Our data may reconcile the disputes
from previous studies because our study was conducted in a large
number of Korean patients with MN who were in a similar phase
of the disease course in the diagnostic stage.
Unfortunately, however, our study did not show a significant
difference in the clinical outcomes of remission rate or time to
remission according to the anti-PLA2R levels. There could be
several limitations to interpreting the data. First, the overall
remission rate was high (67.5%), and the median time to remission
was short (2 months). In this circumstance, it is hard to expect a
significant difference between groups. Second, the rate of
immunosuppressive treatment was also high (67.5%), which made
it difficult to observe the clinical course of the disease according to
anti-PLA2R levels excluding an effect of immunosuppressive
treatment. Therefore, we cannot evaluate solely the effect of
anti-PLA2R on the outcomes. Nevertheless, the present study
showed that most of the patients who had immunosuppressive
treatment achieved remission in a short time, although they
initially had different severities and different levels of autoanti￾bodies. This finding suggests that the effect of immunosuppressive
treatment as a therapeutic intervention is so large that anti-PLA2R
levels cannot influence the clinical outcomes, although the disease
activity at the time of diagnosis is significantly related to the levels
of anti-PLA2R. On the contrary, a recent study of Caucasian
patients with idiopathic MN demonstrated that spontaneous
remissions occurred less frequently in patients with high antibody
titer, whereas total remission rate was not different [25]. The
discrepancy regarding the rate of spontaneous remission may
result from differences in the demographic and clinical character￾istics of the study subjects. However, considering that the overall
remission rate was not different across the antibody titers in an
entire study population who received immunosuppressive treat￾ment, the findings of the previous study seem to be consistent with
our hypothesis that the autoantibody per se could not predict the
outcome excluding the huge effect of therapeutic intervention.
In previous studies, anti-PLA2R antibodies were not detected in
all patients with idiopathic MN [5,6,7]. A possible explanation was
that autoantibodies might be measured in an immunologically
inactive stage after spontaneous remission or immunosuppressive
treatment because serum samples had not been collected in
conjunction with renal biopsy. In contrast, we measured anti￾PLA2R in serum samples that had been collected at the time of
renal biopsy. Nevertheless, anti-PLA2R was not detected in
approximately 30% of patients with idiopathic MN in this study.
This finding suggests that alternative target antigens other than

progression according to anti-PLA2R levels. The proportion of

increased. * Mantel-Haenszel x2 test.

PLA2R may contribute to the pathogenesis of idiopathic MN.
Additionally, our data demonstrated that anti-PLA2R continued to
be negative in patients with idiopathic MN who had no
autoantibodies at the beginning, regardless of their remission
status. This result could support our previous hypothesis. Several
investigators reported other possible target antigens involved in the
development of idiopathic MN [22,26,27,28]. Additionally, we
cannot rule out the possibility that in a quantitative respect, anti￾PLA2Rs were present at sufficient levels to trigger the disease but
were not sufficient to be detected with the current method. In
other words, the current method might not be sensitive enough to
detect trace amounts of autoantibodies.
The present study has several limitations. First, although we
accessed the difference of anti-PLA2R levels using western blot
semi-quantitatively, we could not measure exact titers of the
autoantibody. Second, this study is not feasible for assessing the
confounding effect of the treatment regimen on anti-PLA2R and
clinical outcome because of an uncontrolled study design. The
treatment regimen was decided according to the clinician’s
preference, which was based on the generally accepted treatment

recommendations [19,29,30,31,32]. However, in some cases,
clinicians modified the regimens based on their clinical experi￾ences. The possible heterogeneity in treatment response or adverse
effects across the regimens might contribute to the relationship
between anti-PLA2R titers and clinical outcomes as a confounding
factor. Third, the follow-up patients were likely to have more
severe clinical manifestations compared with other patients who
were lost to follow-up. Thus, the follow-up patients could not
represent the initial study population in its entirety, and the
outcome from the study would have a limitation when applied to
the whole study population. We need additional, well-designed,
prospective, randomized studies to exclude these limitations in the
near future.
In conclusion, we confirm that anti-PLA2R is a specific marker
of idiopathic MN in Korean patients, and we hypothesize that the
autoantibodies might play a role in triggering the development of
the disease. Additionally, the anti-PLA2R levels reflect disease
activity, with an adverse trend in clinical symptoms according to
the antibody levels. Consequently, anti-PLA2R could be a useful
biomarker for diagnosing MN and monitoring disease activity to
predict relapse. However, the present study does not show a
significant difference in clinical outcomes, such as remission rate
and time to remission, in accordance with anti-PLA2R levels,
indicating that the autoantibodies may not be a practical marker
to predict clinical outcomes or determine therapeutic strategies in
current clinical practice.
