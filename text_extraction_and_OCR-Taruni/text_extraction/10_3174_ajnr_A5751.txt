ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dose-dependent association between hyperintensity in deep brain structures on unenhanced T1WIs and
gadolinium-based contrast agent administrations has been demonstrated with subsequent histopathological confirmation of gadolinium
deposition. Our aim was to determine whether greater exposure to linear gadolinium-based contrast agent administration is associated
with higher signal intensity in deep brain structures on unenhanced T1-weighted MR imaging. Secondary objective was to compare signal
intensity differences between ionic and nonionic linear gadolinium-based contrast agents.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subjects with secondary-progressive MS originally enrolled in a multicenter clinical trial were studied
retrospectively. Eighty subjects (high-exposure cohort) received 9 linear gadolinium-based contrast agent administrations (30 nonionic/50
ionic) between week 4 and year 1 and a tenth administration by year 2. One hundred fifteen subjects (low-exposure cohort) received 2
administrations (40 nonionic/75 ionic) between week 4 and year 1 and a third administration by year 2. Signal intensities were measured on
unenhanced T1WIs by placing sample-points on the dentate nucleus, globus pallidus, caudate, thalamus, pons, and white matter, and they were
normalized using the following ratios: dentate/pons, globus pallidus/white matter, caudate/white matter, and thalamus/white matter.
RESULTS: Between week 4 and year 1, subjects in the high-exposure cohort showed increased signal intensity ratios in all regions (P 
.01), while the low-exposure cohort showed only an increase in the dentate nucleus (P  .003). Between years 1 and 2, when both cohorts
received only 1 additional gadolinium-based contrast agent, no significant changes were observed. In the high-exposure cohort, signifi￾cantly higher changes in signal intensity ratios were observed in subjects receiving linear nonionic than in those receiving linear ionic
gadolinium-based contrast agents.
CONCLUSIONS: Hyperintensity in deep brain structures from gadolinium deposition is related to the number of doses and the type of
linear gadolinium-based contrast agent (nonionic greater than ionic) administration.

Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are frequently
used in clinical MR imaging for their paramagnetic proper￾ties to shorten the T1 relaxation time of adjacent water protons
and increase the visibility of abnormal tissues, hence improving
diagnostic value.1
However, free gadolinium is a toxic heavy metal
in vivo and necessitates chelation to polyaminocarboxylic acid
ligands to be excreted safely, primarily through the kidneys. Based
on the chemical structures, there are 4 categories of chelating
agents: macrocyclic ionic and nonionic, and linear ionic and non￾ionic. Stability and the ability to prevent free gadolinium from
dissociating with the ligand differs for each type, with the macro￾cyclic being the most stable, followed by linear ionic, and linear
nonionic being the least stable.2,3
In 2014, Kanda et al4 first reported that increased signal inten￾sity (SI) in the dentate nucleus (DN) and globus pallidus (GP) on
unenhanced T1WI was associated with repeat GBCA exposure.
Subsequent cadaveric histopathologic studies showed that the T1
hyperintensity represented deposition of gadolinium in neuronal
tissues.5,6 Since then, numerous studies have shown multiple ad￾Received April 14, 2018; accepted after revision June 20.

ministrations of linear GBCAs to be associated with T1 hyperin￾tensity in the deep brain structures.4,6-13 However, many of these
studies did not have a control group and had a relatively small and
heterogeneous sample population.
Furthermore, there is a paucity of literature comparing linear
ionic with linear nonionic GBCAs. Ramalho et al14 was the only
group at the time that directly compared the two and showed an
increase in T1 hyperintensity with linear nonionic GBCA (gado￾diamide) but not with linear ionic GBCA (gadobenate dimeglu￾mine). Although other studies did demonstrate an increase in T1
hyperintensity with linear ionic GBCAs, direct comparison with
linear nonionic GBCAs was not made.4,7,10
Our study used a cohort of 195 subjects with secondary-pro￾gressive MS who participated in a clinical trial and underwent 2
different contrast-enhanced MR imaging follow-up schedules (10
versus 3 GBCA administrations) over 2 years. Our goal was to
determine whether multiple GBCA administrations were associ￾ated with increased T1 hyperintensity in deep brain structures on
unenhanced T1WI and whether there was a dose relationship to
these changes. Our secondary objective was to compare linear
ionic with linear nonionic GBCAs to determine whether a differ￾ence could be observed in the degree of T1 SI change.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects
MR imaging data were obtained from subjects with secondary￾progressive MS who were initially enrolled in a 2-year, random￾ized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial assessing the efficacy
of dirucotide (MBP8298) (clinicaltrials.gov NCT00869726 and
ISRCTN98373474).15 Six hundred twelve subjects were recruited
from 47 centers in 10 countries.
Of the 612 subjects, 553 completed the trial and had usable MR
imaging datasets. Ethics committees at each site approved the
study, and all subjects signed written informed consents before
protocol-required procedures. The details of the design, inclu￾sion, and exclusion criteria and results of the 2-year study were
previously reported.15 There were no significant differences re￾garding clinical or MR imaging outcomes between the treatment
and placebo cohorts, except the cumulative number of new and
enlarging T2 lesions that favored the placebo cohort (P  .03).15
Therefore, the subjects in both treatment and placebo arms were
pooled together to be analyzed in the current study. MR imaging
data were centrally analyzed by our re￾search institution (UBC MS/MRI Re￾search Group).
Exclusion criteria for the MR imag￾ing data of this retrospective study were
the absence of unenhanced T1WI, un￾satisfactory image quality due to arti￾facts, and the presence of visible lesions
in both the left and right DN, thalamus
(TH), GP, caudate (CD), and/or frontal
white matter in any of the time points. If
the MR imaging data met the exclusion
criteria, then all imaging studies for the
same subject at other time points were re￾moved from the study analysis. In addi￾tion, subjects who were administered macrocyclic GBCAs (the use of
these agents was uncommon during the study period) and/or were
scanned on a differentMRimaging scannerfor any of theirfollow-up
studies were excluded.
GBCA Administration and Type
The original study population followed 2 distinct contrast-en￾hanced MR imaging follow-up schedules: In the first 100 subjects
(high-exposure cohort), 2 MRIs (week 4, week 0) were per￾formed before the first dose of study medication, followed by
further MRIs at weeks 4, 8, and 12. Another MR imaging was then
performed immediately before the next dose (week 26), followed
by 3 further MRIs at weeks 30, 34, and 38. Annual MRIs were then
performed at years 1 and 2 (weeks 52 and 104). Overall, for the
year 1 pre-GBCA assessment, 9 GBCA injections were given be￾tween week 4 and year 1, and for the year 2 pre-GBCA assess￾ment, an additional GBCA was administered (from the year 1 MR
imaging). The next 453 subjects (low-exposure cohort) had 2
MRIs performed before the first dose of medication (weeks 4
and 0) with annual MRIs at years 1 and 2 (weeks 52 and 104).
Therefore, for the year 1 pre-GBCA assessment, 2 GBCA injec￾tions had been given, and similarly, for the year 2 pre-GBCA as￾sessment, an additional GBCA injection was administered (from
the year 1 MR imaging) (Fig 1). A random sample of the subjects
in the low-exposure cohort was selected proportionately from
each high-exposure cohort center. Subjects for this study received
a standard single dose of either a linear nonionic agent (gadodi￾amide, Omniscan; GE Healthcare, Piscataway, New Jersey) or a
linear ionic agent (gadopentetate dimeglumine, Magnevist; Bayer
HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Wayne, New Jersey), depending on
the center preference. The same GBCA was used throughout the
duration of the study.
MR Imaging Protocol, Processing, and Analysis
Studies were performed with either 1T, 1.5T, or 3T MR imaging
scanners (Table 1) using a standardized imaging protocol with
whole-brain coverage, 3-mm contiguous axial proton density,
T2WI, and pre- and postcontrast (0.1 mmol/kg gadolinium with a
5-minute delay) fast/turbo spin-echo T1WI (TE, 9 –20 ms; TR,
600 –800 ms; and slice gap, 0 mm). Changes to the MR imaging
protocol were not permitted during the trial period.
Group-wise registration was performed using the T2WIs for

cohorts.

all subjects across 3 time points (week 4, year 1, and year 2) to
ensure that the exact same location was measured across all time
points. The sample-points (1  1 pixel; 1 pixel  0.937 mm) were
manually placed on the T2WIs by a single reader (M.L.) blinded to
cohort assignment at our research institution. T2WIs were chosen
instead of T1WIs to blind the reader from any visibly obvious T1
hyperintensity that may bias sample-point placement. In addi￾tion, T2WIs enabled the reader to identify the deep brain struc￾tures more easily. Sample-points were placed at the center of the
left DN, left GP, left TH, left CD head, central pons, and left
frontal WM (Fig 2). Normal-appearing WM that was free of any
visible lesions was used. If the left side could not be assessed due to
the presence of artifacts or visible lesions, then the right side was
used. If the deep brain structures were unclear on T2WIs, the
same section position of proton density images was used to guide
placement. The final sample-point position was confirmed by a
second reader (H.K.), and the sample-point measurement was
conducted once. The sample-points were then mapped onto the

original precontrast (ie, unenhanced) T1WIs, and mean T1 SIs
were obtained. Normalization of the mean T1 SI was performed
by calculating the following ratios: DN/pons, GP/WM, CD/WM,
and TH/WM.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with a commercially available
medical statistical package (GraphPad Prism software; GraphPad
Software, San Diego, California). The two-sample paired t test
was used to evaluate the SI changes in the DN/pons, GP/WM,
TH/WM, and CD/WM between week 4 and year 1, years 1 and
2, and week 4 and year 2 for the high-exposure and low-expo￾sure cohorts. The two-sample unpaired t test was used to compare
the SI changes in the DN/pons, GP/WM, TH/WM, and CD/WM
between the subjects receiving linear nonionic versus the subjects
receiving linear ionic GBCAs in the high-exposure cohort from
week 4 to year 2. For all statistical tests, the level of significance
was set at P  .05.
RESULTS
Of the 100 subjects in the high-exposure cohort, 19 had missing
MR imaging data at different time points and 1 subject had a
major scanner change during follow-up, hence they were ex￾cluded. Overall, 80 subjects had complete MR imaging scan sets
that also met the acceptance criteria for T1 SI analysis. Of the 453
subjects in the low-exposure cohort, 120 were randomly selected
for analysis in which each high-exposure cohort center was pro￾portionally represented (Fig 3). Five subjects from the low-expo￾sure cohort were administered a macrocyclic agent and were ex￾cluded from the analysis. The high- and low-exposure cohorts
had similar baseline characteristics (Table 1).
In the high-exposure cohort, 30 subjects received a linear non￾ionic agent (gadodiamide, Omniscan), while 50 subjects received
a linear ionic agent (gadopentetate dimeglumine, Magnevist). For
the low-exposure cohort, 40 subjects received a linear nonionic
agent (gadodiamide, Omniscan) and 75 subjects received a linear
ionic agent (gadopentetate dimeglumine, Magnevist). In the
high-exposure cohort, the left DN or the left WM for 2 subjects
was replaced with the right side for all 3 time points due to the
presence of a visible lesion. In the low-exposure group, 1 subject’s
leftWM showed a visible lesion and the right side was used instead
for all 3 time points.
Between week 4 and year 1, there were significant absolute
increases in all measured SI ratios (mean  SD) in the high￾exposure group (DN/pons: 0.04  0.09 [relative increase of
4%]; GP/WM: 0.05  0.09 [relative increase of 5%]; CD/
WM: 0.03  0.08 [relative increase of 3%]; and TH/WM:
0.03  0.09 [relative increase of 3%]) (Table 2 and Fig 4), while
only the DN/pons ratio showed a significant increase in the low￾exposure group of 0.05  0.17 (relative increase of 5%) (Table
3). Between years 1 and 2, when both cohorts received only 1
additional GBCA injection, no significant difference was observed
in all SI ratios (Tables 2 and 3). Overall, from week 4 to year 2,
significant SI increases were seen in all deep brain structures in the
high-exposure cohort, but only the DN/pons ratio continued to
show a significant increase in the low-exposure group (Tables 2
and 3). In the high-exposure group, 1 outlier was identified in the
GP/WM and CD/WM SI measurements (On-Line Fig 1); and in
the low-exposure group, 6 outliers in the DN/pons and 1 outlier
in the GP/WM, CD/WM, and TH/WM SI measurements were
demonstrated (On-Line Fig 2). The overall results and statistical
significance remained consistent when the analysis was repeated
with the outliers excluded.
Subgroup analysis of the subjects in the high-exposure cohort
who received linear nonionic GBCA showed a significant increase
in all SI ratios from week 4 to year 2 (Table 4). In comparison,
for subjects who received a linear ionic GBCA, a significant in￾crease was detected for only the DN/pons and CD/WM ratios
(Table 4). There was more than a 2-fold difference in the DN/pons
ratios, where the linear nonionic GBCA group demonstrated an
average of 0.08  0.09 (7.8%) increase, compared with 0.03 
0.09 (3.3%) in the linear ionic group (P  .02).
DISCUSSION
There was a dose-dependent relationship between the number of
linear GBCA administrations and the SI ratio increase in deep
brain structures on unenhanced T1WI. After receiving 9 GBCA
administrations, the high-exposure cohort demonstrated signifi￾cant increases in all measured SI ratios (DN, GP, CD, and TH),
while only the DN showed a significant increase in the low-expo￾sure group after 2 GBCA administrations during the same period.
This finding signifies that the larger number of GBCA adminis￾trations was a major factor in a greater number of deep brain
structures demonstrating significant SI ratio increases in the high￾exposure cohort compared to the low-exposure cohort, support￾ing a dose relationship. This result is in keeping with previous
retrospective studies that have also demonstrated a greater in￾crease in measured SI ratios to be related to multiple linear GBCA

injections.4,6,7,9-14,16-20 However, both the low- and the high-ex￾posure cohorts had a significant-but-similar increase in the DN
within the first year, and a clear dose effect was not seen for this
structure. The DN is known to be more sensitive to gadolinium
accumulation, and we could be seeing a dose-saturation effect in
this structure, though the exact nature is not elucidated by our
methodology. The importance of the number of GBCA adminis￾trations and its relationship with the T1 hyperintensities is further
supported from the results between years 1 and 2, when no SI ratio
changes were seen when the same high- and low-exposure co￾horts received only 1 GBCA administration during the same
period. We suspect that the increases in SI ratios were too
minute and our measurement technique was not sensitive in
detecting the changes.
The subgroup analysis in the high￾exposure cohort comparing the linear
ionic GBCA (gadopentetate dimeglu￾mine) and the linear nonionic GBCA
(gadodiamide) showed that the linear
nonionic GBCA had the greatest in￾crease in T1 hyperintensity in the deep
brain structures. In particular, SI in￾creases were demonstrated in all deep
brain structures with the linear nonionic
GBCA, whereas only the DN and CD
demonstrated SI increase for the linear ionic GBCA. The DN
demonstrated more than a 2-fold difference between the 2 classes
of GBCAs, with an 8% increase in the linear nonionic GBCA
compared with a 3% increase in the linear ionic GBCA (P  .02).
These findings demonstrate in vivo the in vitro results by Frenzel et
al,2 who showed that the linear nonionic GBCAs was less stable
than the linear ionic GBCAs. In their study, approximately 20% of
the gadolinium of the linear nonionic GBCAs was released after
15 days of incubation in human serum, compared with 1%–2% of
the gadolinium of the linear ionic GBCAs.2 No gadolinium was re￾leased with the macrocyclic GBCAs.2 Overall, these findings are in
support of the hypothesis that the propensity of a GBCA to cause
hyperintensity depends on the specific stability of the GBCA.21

Recent studies in rats propose that the penetration of GBCAs
into the brain may occur through the blood-CSF barrier.22,23
Once inside the brain tissue, the chemical stability and tendency
of different GBCAs to dechelate may play an important role in the
deposition of gadolinium in brain tissues. A new study by Frenzel
et al24 showed that after administration of linear ionic and linear
nonionic GBCAs, a large portion of the gadolinium was detected
in rat brain tissues as insoluble fractions or bound to soluble mac￾romolecules, both presumed responsible for increased T1 SI due
to their high relaxivity. These molecules were not found for mac￾rocyclic GBCAs, which were exclusively detected in the soluble
fraction, likely in their intact form, and demonstrated ongoing
excretion.24 However, more research is required to determine the
clinical consequences of gadolinium deposition in either the che￾lated or dechelated form.
As demonstrated on a histopathologic study, the DN appears
to be the most sensitive structure for detecting the T1 SI increase.6
In our study, even after only 2 GBCA administrations, an increase
in T1 hyperintensity was detected in the DN. One possible expla￾nation is that the DN, along with other deep brain structures, is
more susceptible to transmetalation, which allows dechelated
gadolinium to form high-relaxivity macromolecules, as described
above.25
Our study has several limitations. First, because the number of
subjects receiving macrocyclic GBCA was small, this study could
not examine the difference between the use of linear and macro￾cyclic GBCAs. Second, as with most studies on GBCA administra￾tion, the history of prior GBCA administrations and use of other
agents could not be determined. Our study shows that there was at
least a further increase in the SI during our observation window.
Third, due to the multicenter nature of the study, several different
MR imaging scanners were used, which may have introduced
variations among scans, subjects, and scanners. Effort was made
to minimize this issue by proportionately representing each cen￾ter in both the high- and low-exposure cohorts. In addition, each
follow-up MR imaging study was performed using the same MR
imaging machine in the same center for each subject, and the SI
was normalized with the reference standard extracted from the
same image slice (pons and WM). The DN/pons ratio was chosen
because McDonald et al6 demonstrated in postmortem tissue 23-
fold less gadolinium in the pons than in the DN. The WM tract
was chosen for the CD, GP, and TH because it was hypothesized
that the WM would accumulate less gadolinium than the gray
matter structures, such as the TH. Fourth, the sample-point size
used for the study measured 1  1 pixel, which likely introduced
noise and fluctuations in the SI measurements. However, the
small size was chosen to improve the accuracy of the sample-point
placement on small structures such as the DN and CD, which was
important when the sample-points were mapped from T2WI to
T1WI. Furthermore, the degree of SI changes between the high￾and low-exposure cohorts was large enough to overcome this lim￾itation and demonstrated significant and relatively consistent re￾sults. Fifth, the study population had a pre-existing neurologic
disease (MS), which may have confounded the results. However,
the degree of interference is thought to be minimal because both
cohorts had the same diagnosis with similar disease duration
and Expanded Disability Status Scale scores without other po￾tential confounding disease processes. Last, the physical, cog￾nitive, and behavioral outcomes were not analyzed in this
study; however, these are the subject of a current investigation.
CONCLUSIONS
As little as 2 doses of GBCAs can result in an increased T1 SI in the
DN that persists for at least 1 year after administration. T1 hyper￾intensity in the GP, CD, and TH is evident with greater cumula￾tive doses. The degree of increase is related to the location (the DN
being the most sensitive), the number of GBCA administrations,
and the class of GBCA, with linear nonionic having the greater
deposition.
