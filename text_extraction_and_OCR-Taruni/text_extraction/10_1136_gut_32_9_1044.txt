SeHCAT test

Abstract
The effects of ursodeoxycholic acid on ileal
absorption of bile acids and on serum bile acid
and lipoprotein concentrations were studied.
Eight healthy subjects were investigated. The y
emitting bile acid analogue, SeHCAT, was
given orally and its fractional catabolic rate and
seven day retention were assessed by repeated
external counting over the upper abdomen
during the next seven days. Ursodeoxycholic
acid was then given oraily at a dose of 15 mg/kg!
day for three weeks and the study was repeated
during treatment. The fractional catabolic rate
increased by 64% (mean (SD), 0 333 (0.159) v
0-203 (0.061)/day; p<0.05) and seven day
retention decreased by 44% (15 (10) v 27 (10)%,
p<O0OOl), indicating bile acid malabsorption.
Total serum cholesterol fell from 5 79 (1.22) to
5 50 (1.18) mmol/l (p=005), while serum
ursodeoxycholic acid increased 22 fold (7-87
(2.67) v 0-34 (0.24) iimol/l, p<0-001). Five of
the subjects continued taking 30 mg/kg/day of
ursodeoxycholic acid for one week and showed
an increase in fractional catabolic rate of 81%
(0.300 (0-091) v 0-166 (0.037)/day; p<0.05) and
a fall in seven day retention of 50% (16 (12) v 32
(8)%, p<0-01). There were significant reduc￾tions in total cholesterol (5.36 (1.71) v 6-08
(1-47) mmol/l; p<0 05) and low density lipo￾protein cholesterol (3.70 (1-33) v 4*58 (1.16)
mmol/l; p<005). The results support the con￾cept that ursodeoxycholic acid treatment inter￾feres with the absorption of endogenous bile
acids, and emphasise the beneficial effects of
this treatment on lipoprotein concentrations in
man.

The primary bile acids, cholic acid and cheno￾deoxycholic acid, are formed from cholesterol in
the liver and stored in the gall bladder in the
fasting state.' In response to a meal, bile acids are
excreted into the intestine where they contribute
to the efficient absorption of dietary fat and
cholesterol. The secondary bile acids, deoxy￾cholic acid and lithocholic acid, are the result of
dehydroxylation of cholic acid and chenodeoxy￾cholic acid by intestinal bacteria. The reabsorp￾tion of bile acids is very efficient, particularly
because of active uptake in the distal ileum. The
synthesis of bile acids is regulated by a homeo￾static mechanism in which bile acids returning to
the liver from the intestine inhibit their own
synthesis.2 The demand for hepatic cholesterol
increases where bile acid synthesis is stimulated,
and this is met by an increased cholesterol
synthesis as well as by an increased expression of
the low density lipoprotein receptors.' Thus,
disturbances in bile acid kinetics may influence
low density lipoprotein catabolism in several
clinical situations.
Ursodeoxycholic acid, which is the 73 epimer
of chenodeoxycholic acid, is a minor constituent
of the normal bile pool acid in man.4 Its clinical
use has become important in the treatment of
cholesterol gall stones,4 primary biliary cir￾rhosis,5 and sclerosing cholangitis.6 Oral admin￾istration of ursodeoxycholic acid makes the bile
unsaturated with cholesterol because of reduced
cholesterol secretion.478 In contrast to treatment
with chenodeoxycholic acid, the synthesis of
primary bile acids is not suppressed during
ursodeoxycholic acid treatment.79 When
ursodeoxycholic acid becomes the major bile acid
secreted, the absorption of dietary and biliary
cholesterol is reduced through the decreased
micellar solubilisation power of this bile acid.'01
Finally, there may be competition between
ursodeoxycholic acid and the other bile acids for
the intestinal bile acid transport system.'
Bile acid absorption can now be determined by
using 75Selenium homocholic acid taurine
(75SeHCAT), a synthetic analogue of the natural
conjugated bile acid taurocholic acid with the y
emitter 75Se in the side chain.'2"' It has been
shown in previous studies that SeHCAT behaves
like the natural bile acid with regard to entero￾hepatic cycling, hepatic handling, active absorp￾tion from the terminal ileum, faecal excretion,
and overall turnover in the enterohepatic circula￾tion.'2116 The only difference is that SeHCAT under￾goes negligible deconjugation by colonic bacteria.
This investigation was undertaken to study the
effect of treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid
on endogenous bile acid absorption using the
SeHCAT technique. A detailed study was per￾formed simultaneously on the effects on plasma
lipoprotein values and serum bile acid com￾position.
Methods
SUBJECTS
This study comprised eight healthy normo￾lipidaemic volunteers with relative body weight

of ursodeoxycholic acid and five of them later
continued with 30 mg/kg/day. After a basal
clinical and laboratory evaluation excluding
heart, kidney, thyroid, liver disease, and dia￾betes, they were followed closely as outpatients
and allowed to continue their normal diet.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE
Basal data obtained before the start of ursodeoxy￾cholic acid treatment included fasting blood
samples for serum lipid, lipoprotein, and bile
acids concentrations.
SeHCAT (10 [tCi, Amersham International)
was given orally with a drink of water following
the technique described by Thaysen'3 and Delhez
et al.'4 The initial count rate (100% value) was
measured three hours after the intake of isotope
(day 0), with the subject lying in supine and
prone position under an uncollimated gamma
camera (Porta Camera, General Electric.
Nuclear Medical ApS, Denmark). The distance
from the bed to the gamma camera crystal was
maintained at 75 cm and the crystal (Na I) was
centred over the middle of the xiphoidoumbilical
line. The count rate in a 25% window centred
around the 265 and 280 KeV photon peaks of 7Se
was measured. The measurements, which took
10 minutes (five minutes each position), were
repeated on days 2, 4, and 7 after the administra￾tion of the capsule. The background activity was
subtracted and correction was made for the decay
of the isotope. The geometric means of the
counts measured in the anterior and posterior
positions were plotted in a logarithmic-linear
graph. An exponential function was fitted to the
data points using the method of least squares.
The Ti - that is the time when the abdominal
retention of the SeHCAT was reduced to 50% of
initial, was calculated from the curve, as well as
the fractional catabolic rate defined as ln2/T1.
After completing the SeHCAT test the sub￾jects were given ursodeoxycholic acid (Ursofalk,
Dr Falk GmbH & Co, Germany, purity >99%)
in a dose of 15 mg/kg/day for three weeks.
Fasting blood samples (obtained 12-14 hours
after intake) were then collected again, and the
SeHCAT test was repeated. The treatment was
continued during the studies. After completing
the second SeHCAT test, five of the subjects
increased the dose of ursodeoxycholic acid to 30
mg/kg/day in order to load further the bile acid
transport system. Fasting blood samples were
collected after one week, and the SeHCAT test
was repeated during continued 'high dose' treat￾ment.
BIOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS
Serum lipoproteins
Cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were
determined with automated enzymatic tech￾niques (Boehringer Mannheim Test Combina￾tion Cholesterol and Triglycerides, respectively).
Serum lipoprotein analysis was performed
by a combination of ultracentrifugation and
precipitation. 7
Serum bile acids
Serum together with added internal standards
(2H,-cholic acid, 2H4-chenodeoxycholic acid, 2H,-
deoxycholic acid, and 2H3-ursodeoxycholic acid)
was subjected to hydrolysis, acidification, and
methylation. The methylated extracts were sily￾lated and analysed by gas chromatography mass
spectrometry with an NERMAG R10-10H
Quadropol instrument equipped with a multiple
ion detector unit. Details of the method have
been described elsewhere.'8
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The results are expressed as mean (SD) values.
The statistical significance of differences was
evaluated by Student's paired t test.
Results
Giving ursodeoxycholic acid at a dose of 15
mg/kg/day resulted in increased excretion of
SeHCAT in all subjects (Table II). The mean
fractional catabolic rate increased by 64%, from
0-203 (0-061) to 0 333 (0-159)/day (mean (SD);

to 2-41 (086) days (p<0 05). In the five subjects
who continued taking the 'high' dose of
ursodeoxycholic acid, there was a still more
pronounced increase in the fractional catabolic
rate compared with basal values (0 300 (0 091) v
0 166 (0-037)/day, p<O005). Accordingly, the
Ti decreased from 4-34 (0-96) to 2-59 (1-17)
days (p<0005). The seven day retention of
SeHCAT (%) was reduced from 27 (10) to 15
(10)% (p<0001) during the 15 mg/kg/day dose,
while with the 'high' dose it fell from 32 (8) to 16
(12)% (p<0 01).
Serum bile acid analysis during ursodeoxy￾cholic acid administration showed a significant
increase in the ursodeoxycholic acid concentra￾tion (7-87 (2-67) v 0 34 (0-24) ,umol/l; p<0001)
and an even greater one during 'high' dose
treatment (1l134 (4 13) v 0-27 (0 24) [tmol/l;
p<0005), while there was no significant change
in the concentrations of the other bile acids
(Table III).
During treatment with 15 mg/kg/day, the only
significant change in plasma lipids was a decrease
in the total cholesterol concentration from 5-79
(1-22) to 5 50 (1 18) mmol/l (p=0O05), reflecting
a (non-significant) reduction of the concentration
of low density lipoprotein cholesterol from 4-24
(1 02) to 3-84 (0 94) mmol/l (Table IV). During
'high' dose ursodeoxycholic acid administration
there was a further significant decrease from the
basal values in the total cholesterol concentration
(from 6-08 (1-47) to 5 36 (1-71) mmol/l; p<005)
and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (from
4-58 (1-16) to 3-7 (1[33) mmol/l; p<005). There
were no significant changes in total or very low
density lipoprotein triglycerides or very low
density or high density lipoprotein cholesterol
during treatment at either dosage.
Discussion
Several distinct effects of ursodeoxycholic acid
on bile acid and cholesterol metabolism in
normolipidaemic humans are evident from the
present study. Firstly, we could show directly a
dose related interaction with the absorption of
SeHCAT, indicating competitive inhibition of
the intestinal uptake of this radiolabelled bile
acid analogue. Since SeHCAT has very similar
physiological properties to taurocholic acid, a
disturbance of its reabsorption should reflect
interaction with the active transport system in
the terminal ileum. A tendency for an increased
fractional catabolic rate of radiolabelled cholic
acid during ursodeoxycholic acid treatment has
also been observed during kinetic studies in
humans,9 but the present approach should give a
more sensitive detection since SeHCAT is stable
and does not undergo deconjugation by colonic
bacteria. i6
Although the molecular properties of the intes￾tinal bile acid carrier are not yet known in detail,
physiological studies have indicated that the
transport system has a preference for trihydroxy
bile acids and that it is working relatively close to
saturation under physiological conditions.' 19 An
increased load of exogenous ursodeoxycholic
acid should thus preferentially interfere with the
enterohepatic circulation of cholic acid. In
accordance with this contention, the excretion of
cholic acid was increased somewhat more than
that of chenodeoxycholic acid during short term
administration of ursodeoxycholic acid to
patients with ileostomy.2" Such an exclusion of
cholic acid (and chenodeoxycholic acid) from the
enterohepatic circulation would result in reduced
amounts of primary bile acids being returned to
the liver via the portal venous circulation. Since
ursodeoxycholic acid does not seem to suppress
bile acid synthesis72' or the activity of its rate
limiting enzyme, cholesterol 7 a-hydroxylase,22
such treatment would result in an increase in bile
acid production in order to maintain the pool
sizes of these bile acids.
A second new finding in this study emerges
from the determination of individual serum bile
acid concentrations (Table III). In agreement
with previous studies,'8 the administration of 15
mg/kg/day of ursodeoxycholic acid leads to a
large increase in the serum concentration of this
bile acid, whereas there were no significant
changes in the concentrations of cholic acid,
chenodeoxycholic acid, or deoxycholic acid.
This indicates that despite the increased loss of
endogenous bile acid during ursodeoxycholic
acid therapy, the pool sizes of these bile acids
were maintained. This concept could now be
extended to treatment with large amounts of
ursodeoxycholic acid (30 mg/kg/day), where still
no changes in serum bile acid concentrations
could be observed, despite a more than 40 fold
increase in ursodeoxycholic acid serum con￾centrations. It should be noted that all these
measurements refer to the fasting state, and that
a reduced return of bile acids may be present
postprandially, as has recently been shown

during cholestyramine treatment.23 The data in
this study are thus in agreement with the concept
of a stimulated bile acid production during
ursodeoxycholic acid treatment, and such an
effect could at least partially explain why
the secretion rate of cholesterol into bile is
reduced.7"
A third finding was a dose related decrease in
plasma total and low density lipoprotein chole￾sterol concentrations (Table IV). A cholesterol
lowering effect of ursodeoxycholic acid has been
noted in some previous studies,24 25 but this is not
a universal finding.4 The effect is in clear contrast
to observations during chenodeoxycholic acid
therapy, where low density lipoprotein chole￾sterol and the low:high density lipoprotein ratios
are frequently increased.2628 It is reasonable to
assume that the difference between the two bile
acids relates to their differing effects on hepatic
cholesterol metabolism. Thus, chenodeoxy￾cholic acid is known to suppress drastically bile
acid biosynthesis,729 mediated via down regula￾tion of the cholesterol 7 a-hydroxylase.22 This in
turn creates a decreased hepatic demand for
cholesterol, resulting in reduced activity of HMG
CoA reductase30 as well as a tendency for reduced
low density lipoprotein receptor expression.3'
The latter effect is probably the explanation for
the approximately 10% increase in low density
lipoprotein cholesterol which has been
reported.2"28 On the other hand, as discussed
above, ursodeoxycholic acid slightly increases
the activity of cholesterol 7 ct-hydroxylase22 and
bile acid production rate.72' This would lead to
an increased hepatic demand for cholesterol,
reflected in an unchanged or slightly stimulated
activity of HMG CoA reductase.24 32 It is reason￾able to assume that the low density lipoprotein
receptor expression is stimulated, and such a
phenomenon could well explain the decrease in
low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentra￾tions, particularly since there is no evidence of an
effect on the very low density lipoprotein produc￾tion rate.9 Another mechanism that is probably
operative during ursodeoxycholic acid therapy is
a reduced -absorption of dietary and biliary
cholesterol because of the reduced capacity to
form micelles. "'"17 33
In conclusion, treatment with ursodeoxycholic
acid results in a dose dependent reduction of
intestinal bile acid reabsorption. The unchanged
serum concentrations of cholic acid, cheno￾deoxycholic acid, and deoxycholic acid indicate a
stimulated bile acid production rate with
unchanged pools. In addition, ursodeoxycholic
acid treatment is associated with lowering oftotal
and low density lipoprotein cholesterol, hypo￾thetically as the result of stimulation of low
density lipoprotein receptor expression second￾ary to an increased hepatic cholesterol demand.
Compared with chenodeoxycholic acid, this
effect on lipoprotein concentrations should be an
advantage during long term treatment in gall
stone disease.
