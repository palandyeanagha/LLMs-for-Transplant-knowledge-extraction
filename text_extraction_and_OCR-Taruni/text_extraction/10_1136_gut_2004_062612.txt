mall intestinal transplantation should now be routinely considered for patients with
irreversible intestinal failure and complications of parenteral nutrition (PN). Although
technically possible for a century,1 and attempted in humans for more than 40 years,2
immunological graft intolerance presented an impenetrable barrier to successful engraftment
until the development of the powerful calcineurin inhibitor immunosuppressive agents in the late
1970s. Their subsequent clinical use over the past 17 years has transformed small intestinal
transplantation from a position of predictable failure to predominant success and routine clinical
reality for a select group of patients
One year graft survivals for solid organs are now excellent and have been improving steadily
since the introduction of ciclosporin to routine clinical practice in the early 1980s.3 4 In contrast,
survival values for small intestinal transplantation have been slow to improve although are now
comparable with those for lung, and the latest published values for one year survival approximate
those for liver and kidney (table 1) Why then has progress with intestinal transplantation been so
much more difficult?
c A BRIEF HISTORY OF SMALL INTESTINAL TRANSPLANTATION
The technical feasibility of the procedure has been established for a century1 but immunological
feasibility was far more difficult to establish. The high density of lymphoid tissue and the large
mucosal surface area of the small intestine expressing class 2 major histocompatability antigens
fuels the mutual intolerance between graft and host. As a hollow organ whose lumen is colonised
by a multitude of bacteria and other micro-organisms, it behaves as a potent vector of infection to
the host, a problem that is made worse by the precarious barrier from the lumen provided by the
thin and vulnerable monolayer of mucosal epithelium. Here then is the fine balance between
immunosuppression and infection that has bedevilled its transplantation and led to failure in so
many early attempts.2
Following early transplantation attempts, deaths were most commonly a consequence of acute
graft rejection and subsequent sepsis associated multiorgan failure.5 6 This scenario was not
improved even with the introduction of combination therapy with azathioprine, prednisolone,
and antilymphocyte globulin.7 8 More powerful immunosuppression was needed and the target of
most of the early research.
The introduction of ciclosporin in 1978 by Calne and colleagues3 4 both accelerated progress in
solid organ transplantation and rekindled interest in intestinal grafts. Success in this new
ciclosporin era led to the transition from success in animals to the first long term success in
humans. In 1988 Grant and colleagues8 reported a patient with short gut syndrome following
mesenteric infarction who had undergone combined liver and small intestine transplantation and
remained alive one year after the procedure. Other groups soon reported similar experi￾ences.8 9 10 11 Even though the barrier of chronic rejection was soon evident, the achievement of
medium term survival was heralded as a defining moment.
The introduction of tacrolimus, a potent new calcineurin inhibitor, marked the next major step
in allowing clinical intestinal transplantation to become a reality. Early rejection was then
superseded by infection as the main cause of death,12 indicating the need to refine the target of
immunological suppression to reduce infection while avoiding rejection. Another adverse effect of
heavy immunosuppression appeared to be a substantial increase in the incidence of chronic
rejection,13 and the near total loss of progressive tolerance that had allowed low dose maintenance
immunosuppresion or immunosuppression free management in a proportion of the earlier
procedures.14 15
A possible explanation for the divergent frequencies of acute and chronic rejection and the
potential key to tolerance with minimal immunosuppression came from the report by Starzl et al
that long term tolerance was associated with donor and host leucocyte chimerism.15 16 This
apparent engagement of donor and host leucocytes seemed pivotal to long term tolerance but

vulnerable to ablation by the powerful new immunosuppres￾sants.17 Exhaustive deletion of helper and cytotoxic T cells18
and preferential differentiation to suppressor and regulatory
T cells following chronic exposure of host T cells to donor
antigens presented in non-inflamed conditions after graft
‘‘healing- in’’ have been postulated as the mechanisms of
long term tolerance.19 20
Monoclonal antibody therapy presented the potential to
provide specific targeting of a wide range of immune
mediators and, with the expected greater degree of selectiv￾ity, perhaps fewer problems with infection. It was postulated
that preoperative induction with host lymphocyte depleting
antibody might allow a more equitable engagement of graft
with host and promote tolerance. Campath 1H, a monoclonal
anti-CD 54 antibody which depletes both T and B cells19 was
used for a multivisceral transplantation in Cambridge UK in
1995. In combination with tacrolimus the level of immuno￾suppression was profound, leading to episodes of severe
infection but subsequently the immunosuppression could be
steadily reduced without evidence of rejection. Initially
composite grafting was thought to be entirely responsible
for this greater degree of immunological tolerance21 but with
the advancement of global experience and the benefits of a
single international registry additional influence of the type
and degree of immunosuppression on tolerance was appre￾ciated.19 Judicious immunosuppression with the aim of
engaging graft and host in a manner that encourages
tolerance with minimal immunosuppression has become
the goal of modern transplantation immunosuppression.14 19
Facilitated by deployment of the more selective monoclonal
antibody technology, inroads into maximising host tolerance
to minimise immunosuppression are being made19 and
survival values are inexorably improving (fig 1).22
Immunological engagement and mutual tolerance is
fundamental to successful long term engraftment.19 Reliable
achievement of this state of full or partial tolerance
represents the next and perhaps last major barrier to the
use of transplantation as first line treatment for intestinal
failure.
The success of the tacrolimus era led to an exponential
increase in transplantation procedures (fig 2) and centres are
now established in more than 30 countries. The development
of monoclonal antibody technology has further improved
survival. Recent reports of over 90% one year survival rates23
indicate the current incremental progression to a position
that might eventually challenge PN as primary treatment for
small intestinal failure. Such a broadening of the indications

already practised sporadically in some centres will generate
the next quantum increase in small intestinal transplanta￾tion.
INDICATIONS FOR SMALL INTESTINAL
TRANSPLANTATION
Patient selection
For the majority of patients, small intestinal transplantation
is indicated only when irreversible small intestinal failure
coexists with failure of PN. The main causes of PN failure are
loss of venous access due to venous thrombosis, PN related
liver disease, and recurrent line related sepsis.24–26 A global
consensus for indications has yet to be published but is likely
to be broadly in line with the healthcare finance administra￾tion of North American policy decision.27 Patients with
significant complications of PN (table 2) should be discussed
with an intestinal failure centre where they can be evaluated
and PN optimised prior to referral to a transplantation centre
if required.
Patients with more advanced disease with one or less PN
intravenous neck access sites but patent femoral veins, less
than three PN intravenous neck vein access sites without
bilateral femoral access, or severe liver dysfunction should be
assessed by a transplant centre. Frequently recurrent line
infections represent the indication in the majority of the
other candidates. Evisceration during removal of large
desmoid tumours, along with a few highly selected patients
with malignant disease, may be considered suitable (table 3)
The incidence of severe PN related liver disease has been
reported to affect as many as 15% of patients after one year28
and 50% of patients after five years. Although the latter
report included patients with chronic hepatitis C and B
infection it was based on data acquired from a central
government coordinated data bank and has the advantage of
better representing the entire population of patients on PN
than single centre studies.29 This frequency of liver disease
together with venous occlusion and infection would be
expected to result in a considerable demand for small
intestinal transplantation in the UK. The number of patients
on PN in the UK has been steadily increasing, numbering
approximately 500 in 2003.30 However, in the UK patients are
rarely referred for consideration and only 14 adult trans￾plantations have been undertaken over the last 15 years.
TIMING REFERRAL
Timely referral for assessment is essential to allow optimisa￾tion of physical and psychological factors and should be at a
stage when central venous access is adequate for surgery and
management of postoperative complications which may
include renal replacement therapy. Patients referred to an
intestinal failure centre can then be followed closely and
familiarised with the options for treatment in the event of
further deterioration. Patients who have lost all venous
access in the neck and are receiving PN via the femoral vein
are at a considerable disadvantage. Not only are they more
prone to line infections26 but if composite grafting of two or
more organs is to be considered central venous access above
the hepatic veins will be necessary. Time should be available
to minimise comorbidity, particularly that which might
increase the likelihood of postoperative complications, such
as chronic infections which may be the focus of serious
postoperative infections during immunosuppression. Mental
health problems can present a threat to patients of similar
severity to physical disease and should not be underestimated
or overlooked.31
Patients who are well enough to be admitted for
transplantation from home have a significantly better
prognosis than those who are medically unstable and require
hospitalisation during the pretransplant period.32 This under￾scores the importance of preoperative preparation and timing
intervention which requires fine judgement to find the
window of opportunity that avoids inappropriate interven￾tion without allowing the patient’s condition to deteriorate to
a point that excludes transplantation or makes it unduly
hazardous.
Time on the waiting list is often protracted, with
approximately 40% waiting longer than a year and relatively

longer if composite grafts are required.33 Early referral before
the patient develops severe irreversible liver disease may
allow timely isolated small intestinal transplantation, avoid￾ing the need for more complicated grafts.
As a hollow non-sterile organ the small intestine is very
prone to damage, and cold ischaemia times must be
minimised. Donor suitability is further restricted by accom￾modation of the graft within an often damaged peritoneal
cavity. Late referral of patients and slow donor acquisition
cause considerable waiting list mortality which has been
reported to be as high as 50%.32 34–36 Most of these deaths (two
thirds) occur in infants who in particular should be referred
or at least discussed with the appropriate transplant centre at
an early stage. Discussion of full referral guidelines for
children37 38 are beyond the scope of this article. However, in
general, intestinal disorders with a poor prognosis, PN related
liver dysfunction, or protracted PN dependence in infants and
children require prompt referral.
Occasionally PN fails because of frequent line infections.
In most cases re-education and modification of line care
can resolve the problem. However, for some these infec￾tions are frequent and recurrent39 and in the event of
serious life threatening infection, transplantation should be
considered.
In the UK, Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge and
St James’s hospital in Leeds are national centres for adult
small intestinal transplantation, and St Mark’s Hospital
Northwick Park, London and The Hope hospital in
Manchester are the national centres for intestinal failure.
Referral of children should be made to the Birmingham
Children’s Hospital.
IMMUNOSUPPRESSION
Current regimens are usually based on the powerful
calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus. The combination of tacroli￾mus and sirolimus does not have additional benefit over
tacrolimus alone and current regimens are evolving away
from combination maintenance therapy with adjunctive
agents such as the antiproliferative agent mycophenolate
mofetil,40 the non-calcineurin inhibitor immunosuppressant
sirolimus,23 or steroids, towards monotherapy with tacroli￾mus17 or sirolimus41 following induction with lymphocyte
depleting antibodies such as antithymocyte globu￾lin,17Campath 1H (alemtuzumab),24 42 OKT3,13 or with mono￾clonal anti-interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor antibodies (daclizu￾mab or basiliximab).43–47 Antibody preconditioning seems to
allow less potent subsequent maintenance immunosuppres￾sion and improved tolerance, allowing lower levels of
tacrolimus.17 Despite the use of lower levels of tacrolimus,
monitoring of haematological and renal parameters remains
important. Cardiomyopathy and neurological complications
also continue to be considerations. Antibody therapies are
occasionally associated with severe infusion related adverse
reactions caused by hypersensitivity or profound cytotoxin
release but in most cases they are well tolerated. There is an
increasing trend to minimise the use of steroids although
they remain part of most regimens. In addition, some have
used donor bone marrow infusions48 49 in an attempt to
achieve better immunological engagement and improve
subsequent long term tolerance, so reducing chronic rejec￾tion.14 Lymphocyte depletion of the graft by ex vivo intestine
irradiation49 has shown promise but is limited by concerns
related to graft radiation damage.
SURGERY
The surgical procedure is usually technically demanding.
Many of the patients who are candidates for small bowel
transplantation will have a heavily scarred abdominal wall
from multiple abdominal procedures and previous bowel
resections, resulting in difficult access to a reduced volume
abdominal cavity. At times this already difficult situation can
be further compounded by portal hypertension as a result of
concomitant liver disease. Selecting smaller size donors and
thus smaller grafts to be transplanted will help with this issue
but further graft size reduction may be necessary, and
securing a satisfactory abdominal wall closure represents a
substantial challenge. In many cases an end ileostomy will be
appropriate and in the short term allows access for monitor￾ing of the graft by repeated biopsies to look for evidence of
rejection.
Isolated small bowel transplantation is in principle the
simplest surgical procedure and offers a solution to the
patient who has problems with venous access and no
evidence of irreversible liver disease. It has the theoretical
advantage that the graft can be removed if necessary and the
patient returned to PN, although this frequently proves not to
be the case due to sepsis and other postoperative complica￾tions. A graft is obtained from a cadaveric donor based on the
superior mesenteric artery (SMA) with a narrow patch of
aortic wall (a Carrel patch) and the superior mesenteric vein
(SMV)/proximal portal vein (PV). The graft is placed in the
abdominal cavity and revascularised by anastomosing the
narrow patch of aortic wall around the orifice of the SMA
with the front wall of the aorta in the recipient. The SMV/PV
are anastomosed to either the right side of the recipient portal
vein which can be approached just behind the bile duct above
the upper border of the duodenum after mobilising the
duodenum and head of pancreas, or more simply to the front
surface of the inferior vena cava (IVC) at the same level as
the anastomosis to the aorta. The former technique is more
technically demanding but does offer restoration of physio￾logical drainage of the gut via the portal system. In practice,
the latter technique is technically easier and is seldom
associated with major problems in terms of outcome.50
Intestinal continuity is restored by performing a proximal
anastomosis to the remaining recipient gut and a distal
ileostomy fashioned. Grafts have also been obtained from
living donors based on the distal SMA and SMV, removing
approximately one third of the donor’s small bowel and
anastomosing the graft to the aorta and IVC in the same way
as for a cadaveric graft.51
Combined liver and small bowel transplantation offers a
treatment option in cases where there is irreversible liver
damage and has been more commonly applied in paediatric
cases, where PN related liver disease has been more of a
problem than in the adult population. There are a number of
technical issues with such procedures. Excision of the liver
will leave any residual upper abdominal organs (usually
stomach, duodenum, pancreas, and spleen) without any
venous drainage unless the remaining native portal vein
(which will have been divided in removing the diseased liver)
is anastomosed to the cava to form a porta-caval shunt or
‘‘piggy backed’’ onto the portal vein of the liver/intestinal
graft. The former usually offers the simplest option. Biliary
drainage of the liver is restored either by a direct anatomosis
to the remaining native bile duct or to a roux loop created
from the transplanted bowel (identical to the biliary drainage

options in conventional liver transplantation). More recently
a composite graft including the liver, intestine, duodenum,
and head of pancreas (the pancreas being divided in the line
of the portal vein/SMV) has been described which includes
all of the donor bile duct and avoids the need for an
additional biliary anastomosis and eliminates the risk of
biliary leakage or anastomotic stricture.48
Vascular reconstruction for the graft in these cases will
involve anastomosis of the caval venous outflow from the
liver, either in the classical orthotopic liver transplant fashion
or using a piggy back technique to the hepatic veins (or the
more recently described technique of cavo-cavostomy) and
an arterial anastomosis to the recipient aorta, usually
involving a conduit of donor iliac artery or donor aorta
anastomosed to a vascular patch from the donor, including
the origins of the coeliac axis and SMA (which are closely
related).
Multivisceral grafting offers an option in cases with large
intra-abdominal desmoid tumours or other extensive disease
processes which may necessitate excision of most or even all
of the intra-abdominal organs.
Such grafts may involve a variety of organs, usually
including the liver, stomach, pancreas, duodenum, and small
bowel. The spleen is removed to avoid immunological
sequelae and if necessary a kidney can also be included.
The vascular reconstruction required will depend on the
nature of the graft but can commonly be achieved by
substitution of a segment of recipient IVC (if a kidney is
also being included in the graft the cava draining the right
renal vein can also be included) and a segment of donor
aorta, including the coeliac axis and SMA (and if needed the
right renal artery for an orthotopic kidney graft), or simply an
aortic patch anastomosed to the front of the aorta for arterial
inflow. Figure 3 illustrates such a case of our own where a
patient with Gardner’s syndrome complicated by extensive
intra-abdominal desmoid disease required total exenteration
(fig 3A). He received a graft consisting of stomach, liver,
pancreas, small intestine, and a single kidney (graft shown in
position in fig 3B). This patient died following head trauma
five years after the procedure with a fully functioning graft.
OUTCOME
Patient and graft survival
Recent reports from certain centres are encouraging, with one
year patient and graft survival rates for small intestine alone
of approximately 90% and 80%,52 53 which are similar to those
for children of 80% and 80%, respectively,54 and comparable
with those of solid organ transplantation (table 1) Combined
international data indicate overall one year patient and graft
survival of procedures undertaken since 2000 of approxi￾mately 70%, improving from about 50% in the early 1990s
(fig 1).32
Longer term survival values, which include patients
receiving earlier immunosuppression strategies, are poorer
but in most cases preferable to continuation on failing PN.
Patients receiving intestinal or composite grafts since 1999
are reported by the International Registry32 to have one and
five year graft and patient survival rates of approximately
60% and 45%, and 39% and 48%, respectively This is similar
to the UK experience since 1995 of 57% and 43% respectively
for both grafts and patients.31
The main reasons for graft loss in adults are rejection
(48%), thrombosis/ischaemia (28%), and sepsis (12%).
Infection is the main cause of death followed by rejection.32
Quality of life
Several groups have reported an improvement in the quality
of life following intestinal transplantation for patients who
had complications of home parenteral nutrition (HPN)
preoperatively.55 56 It also compares favourably with patients
on stable HPN57 and is better in transplanted patients than in
patients who continue with frequent complications of PN.56
Cost effectiveness
Although not extensively studied, the available evidence
suggests that intestinal transplantation is less costly than
HPN.58 59 The precise costs of HPN are case sensitive but are
approximately £40 000 per patient per year. Patients with
frequent complications will require greater health care
provision with associated additional costs. On the other
hand, the first and by far the most expensive year of
intestinal transplantation costs is approximately £80 000 and

falls considerably in subsequent years. Cost effectiveness has
not been formally compared with PN. However, when
assessed by quality of life years, it might currently be
expected to be better than patients with frequent complica￾tions of PN but inferior to those on stable HPN as the latter
have a lower long term mortality.
Factors influencing outcome
Patients admitted for transplantation from their home have
significantly better graft survival which underscores the need
for good preoperative preparation to optimise patient health.
Graft survival is also better in those who have received
antibody induction therapy with lymphocyte depleting or
anti-IL-2 receptor antibody (fig 4) and when the centre has
had experience of more than nine procedures.32 The highest
success rates have been reported using antilymphocytic
antibodies and post-transplantation tacrolimus monotherapy
which is hoped to reduce postoperative immunosuppression
related complications.17 The type of maintenance immuno￾suppression also seems to influence patient and graft survival
(fig 5). (Age)2 is a significant risk associated continuous
variable. Interestingly, the primary diagnosis, sex of the
recipient, type of graft, retransplantation, portal venous
drainage, and donor graft irradiation were not significant
prognostic factors.32
Acute graft rejection
Until recently, acute host versus graft rejection was reported
to affect between 50%32 54 and 100%,52 54 with most having
averaged values for all types of graft between 70% and 80%.27
However, novel regimens using antibody induction have seen
the incidence fall, and Campath IH (alemtuzimab) is
associated with a particularly low rate of 20% in some
series.22 Composite grafts that include the liver tend to have a
protective effect on acute intestinal rejection48 and this may
depend upon establishment of physiological perfusion pre￾serving both arterial and portal venous blood flow. Prompt
histological diagnosis60 61 and treatment is usually effective to
prevent severe rejection and graft loss but can be problematic
when rejection is patchy.62 Episodes are usually steroid
responsive and can also be effectively treated with anti￾lymphocyte antibodies such as OKT3.48 A positive lymphocyte
crossmatch is associated with a higher frequency of rejection
whereas the degree of HLA mismatch is not. Most episodes of
rejection occur within the first three months but can occur
more than a year after transplantation.63
Graft versus host disease
The large quantity of lymphoid tissue present in the small
intestine gave rise to early concerns that graft versus host
disease would be a common problem. However, in practice,
the incidence is far lower than expected, reportedly affecting
between 5% and 16% of patients. The condition often
manifests as a skin rash and is treated by increasing
immunosuppression. However, occasionally it can be severe
and may progress to multiorgan failure.32 48
Chronic graft rejection
With the gradual reduction of acute rejection and better short
term survival, chronic rejection has become a more sig￾nificant problem and the main limitation to long term
survival after the first year. It affects approximately 8% of
grafts62 and occurs insidiously, which often results in late
diagnosis. The pathological changes of chronic rejection are
seen in the deep layers of the gut wall and the gut
vasculature, with relative mucosal sparing. Superficial
biopsies obtained during endoscopic routine surveillance
can miss these changes and full thickness biopsies are often
required which further hampers the diagnosis. The clinical
picture of chronic watery diarrhoea, weight loss, and chronic
abdominal pain is the result of the underlying obliterative
endarterectomy with neointimal hyperplasia that is the
pathological hall mark of the condition.61
Postoperative infection
Clinical signs of impending sepsis in the postoperative period
are often subtle but can proceed extremely rapidly, com￾monly making this the most challenging part of the
procedure. Acute rejection can first manifest itself as
infection caused by disruption of the mucosal barrier and
bacterial translocation, leading to a complex clinical picture.
Infection is now the most frequent cause of death32 in
contrast with the pre-tacrolimus era when rejection was
predominant. Almost all patients experience at least one
infection following transplantation.64 Serious infections are
most usually bacterial and commonly affect central venous
lines, the lower respiratory tract, and the urinary system.

Intra-abdominal collections can also occur often as a
consequence of intestinal bacterial translocation65 or perito￾neal contamination during surgery.64
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection affects up to one third of
patients and is higher when grafts are CMV positive.
Strategies to encourage tolerance and allow lower levels of
immunosuppression will be important to reduce the inci￾dence of CMV disease which is quite resistant to ganciclovir
prophylaxis.66
POTENTIAL DEMAND
The British artificial nutrition survey reported that the point
prevalence of adults on HPN in 2002 was 465, which is part of
an increasing trend from 206 in 1996, 306 in1998, and 400 in
2000.30 With greater awareness of the life saving potential of
PN and a more interventional approach to conditions such as
small intestinal infarction, this value is expected to continue
to increase. The annual mortality statistics for England and
Wales indicate that the death rate for small intestine
catastrophe is 15, 95, and 800 and volvulus 12, 33, and 350
per 100 000 for ages up to 45, 60, and over 60 years,
respectively.67 Should more of these patients become estab￾lished on PN the requirement for small intestinal transplan￾tation would consequently increase. Additionally, further
improvements in long term survival may soon see transplan￾tation challenge PN as the treatment of choice for those
patients who find that PN adversely affects their quality of
life.
THE FUTURE
As patient survival approaches that of PN the improved
quality of life will make small intestinal transplantation an
increasingly attractive prospect and eventually an alternative
to PN. Certain centres are now offering carefully selected
patients transplantation as an alternative to PN on this
basis.58 The ability to reliably achieve immunological toler￾ance is likely to be the key to improved long term survival.
Strategies to increase residual intestinal function with the
use of growth factors such as glucagon-like peptide-274 75 or
engineer the growth of additional ‘‘intestinal’’ tissue with the
capacity to digest and absorb nutrients76 77 are being devel￾oped and may provide alternatives to transplantation in the
future.
Progress with the development of small intestine trans￾plantation in the UK has been impaired by the apparently low
demand for the procedure. It is however probable that the
actual requirement is much greater.
Small intestinal transplantation is now established as the
favoured treatment option for patients with significant
complications of PN. The timing of transplantation is critical
and patients should be referred for assessment before
debilitation and inadequate venous access substantially
increases the associated risks.

Summary
c Small intestinal transplantation should be considered
routinely as an option for patients with irreversible small
intestinal failure who have complications of parenteral
nutrition.
c Patient and graft survival rates are now comparable with
those of lung, and approaching those of liver and heart
transplantation.
c Quality of life of patients following small intestinal
transplantation is improved and similar to that of patients
on stable uncomplicated home parenteral nutrition.
c The most recent results using more targeted immunosup￾pression with lymphocyte depleting antibodies and less
potent maintenance immunosuppression indicate a further
improvement in one year survival, reaching 90% in some
centres.
c Small intestinal transplantation may become an alter￾native to parenteral nutrition for patients with irreversible
small intestinal failure if the current trend of improvement
in survival values continues.
c Patients with complications of parenteral nutrition should
be referred to an intestinal failure or transplantation
centre at an appropriate stage, as indicated in this article,
before their deterioration substantially increases their
surgical risk.
