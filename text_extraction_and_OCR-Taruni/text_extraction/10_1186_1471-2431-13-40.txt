Abstract
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the leading cause of chronic liver disease in children. NAFLD has emerged to
be extremely prevalent, and predicted by obesity and male gender. It is defined by hepatic fat infiltration >5%
hepatocytes, in the absence of other causes of liver pathology. It includes a spectrum of disease ranging from
intrahepatic fat accumulation (steatosis) to various degrees of necrotic inflammation and fibrosis
(non-alcoholic steatohepatatis [NASH]). NAFLD is associated, in children as in adults, with severe metabolic
impairments, determining an increased risk of developing the metabolic syndrome. It can evolve to cirrhosis and
hepatocellular carcinoma, with the consequent need for liver transplantation. Both genetic and environmental factors
seem to be involved in the development and progression of the disease, but its physiopathology is not yet entirely
clear. In view of this mounting epidemic phenomenon involving the youth, the study of NAFLD should be a priority for
all health care systems. This review provides an overview of current and new clinical-histological concepts of pediatric
NAFLD, going through possible implications into patho-physiolocical and therapeutic perspectives.
Keywords: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, Non-alcoholic steatohepatatis, Obesity, Metabolic syndrome
Introduction
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has recently
emerged as the leading cause of chronic liver disease in
children [1-3]. The increasing incidence of NAFLD is a
mirror of the worldwide annual increment of obese indi￾viduals [4-6]. Data from the last National Health Nutrition
Examination Survey shows that 17% of all children in
western countries are overweight. Among them, 70% to
80% have NAFLD.
NAFLD is defined by hepatic fat infiltration >5% hepa￾tocytes, as assessed by liver biopsy, in the absence of
excessive alcohol intake, or the evidence of viral, auto￾immune or drug-induced liver disease. It includes a
spectrum of liver disease ranging from intrahepatic fat
accumulation (steatosis) to various degrees of necrotic
inflammation and fibrosis (non-alcoholic steatohepatatis
[NASH]) [7,8]. Pediatric NAFLD histopathology has dis￾tinct characteristics when compared with that of adults
[9], but whether these differences are due to different
mechanisms in the pathogenesis, or represent two phe￾notypes, is still unclear.
Despite the differences, pediatric NAFLD is associated,
as it is in adults, with severe metabolic impairments
such as insulin resistance, hypertension and abdominal
obesity, determining an increased risk of developing type
2 diabetes mellitus, the metabolic syndrome and car￾diovascular diseases [10,11]. The natural history and
prognosis of NAFLD in children is still uncertain, since
published data with long-term follow up is scant. It has
been reported that, in susceptible individuals, NAFLD
can evolve to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma,
with the consequent need for liver transplantation [12].
Both genetic and environmental factors seem to be
involved in the development and progression of the
disease [13,14], and a better understanding of its physio￾pathology will certainly help in reducing future morbid￾ity and mortality from NAFLD. Moreover, in view of this
mounting epidemic phenomenon involving the youth of
today, the study and identification of treatment for chil￾dren and adolescents with this liver disease should be a
priority for all health care systems. * Correspondence: valentagio@yahoo.it

This review will therefore provide an overview of
the current concepts in epidemiology, histological fea￾tures, etiopathogenesis, and the diagnosis and treatment
of pediatric NAFLD, but will particularly aim to go
through the new concepts in the aforesaid field and
their possible implications into patho-physiolocical and
therapeutic perspectives.
Epidemiology and risk factors
Data published from centers in North America, Europe,
Asia, South America and Australia [15-17] demonstrates
that NAFLD nowadays interests not only the western
countries. Pediatric NAFLD prevalence is estimated to
be between 3% and 10%. It varies as such because it is
influenced by the characteristics of the population, espe￾cially lifestyle habits, and the diagnostic method used to
detect it. In fact, although liver histology is the gold
standard for diagnosing NAFLD, performing biopsies
to determine disease prevalence is not always feasible.
Children with NAFLD typically have slightly elevated
liver enzyme values (aspartate aminotransferase [AST],
and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) in the absence of
excessive alcohol consumption and other causes of stea￾tosis [18]. Therefore, elevated serum levels of liver en￾zymes, even though they often misrepresent the entity of
intrahepatic damage, are used as a valuable and noninva￾sive test to screen for pediatric NAFLD [19]. Alterna￾tively, BMI and ultrasonography can also be used, even
though their diagnostic accuracy limitations are the
same as those reported for ALT (for instance, fibrosis is
undetectable with these methods).
One of the few population-based studies published in
this field reports data from the United States (NHANES
III) [20] showing that the prevalence of elevated ALT
levels (> 30 IU/L) was 7.4% among white adolescents,
11.5% among Mexican American adolescents and 6.0%
among black adolescents. Elevated ALT levels were
present in 12.4% of male subjects compared with 3.5% of
female subjects. Data from South Korea [16] and Japan
[21] is similar. It is, therefore, reasonable to assume that
NAFLD prevalence in adolescents is at least 2.6% to
3.2%. As a matter of fact, this data underestimates the
real prevalence, since surrogate markers have been used
to diagnose NAFLD.
An autopsy study by Schwimmer and colleagues [22]
reviewed the records and liver histological features of
742 children aged 2 to 19 years, who died from unnat￾ural causes in San Diego County between 1993 and
2003. The prevalence of fatty liver (> 5% of hepatocytes
containing macrovesicular fat), adjusted for age, gender,
race, and ethnicity was estimated to be 9.6%, although
the autopsy cohort was understandably biased relative
to the general population, due to overrepresentation of
Hispanic boys.
Despite the diversity of diagnostic criteria used in
population-based studies, obesity is the main risk factor
for pediatric NAFLD. In fact, the prevalence of NAFLD
in obese children increases up to 80% in several
obesogenic countries, including USA, Europe and Japan
[21-26]. Huang et al. [27] recently reported that in 219
schoolchildren, aged 6 to 12 years, rates of NAFLD were
3% in the normal-weight range, 25% in the overweight
range, and 76% in obese children.
A population-specific based study [28] has been
performed in Europe. One-hundred-and-eleven special￾ized pediatric obesity centers in Germany, Austria and
Switzerland were involved, and 16,390 overweight, obese
and extremely obese children and adolescents were in￾cluded and studied for NAFLD. NAFLD was defined by
AST and/or ALT > 50 Ul-1. NAFLD was present in 11%
of the study population, predominantly in boys (boys vs
girls; 14.4:7.4%; P<0.001), and in the extremely obese
group (obese vs extremely obese; 9.5:17.0%; P<0.001).
NAFLD in children is also strongly associated with
several other features of the metabolic syndrome (MS),
especially insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus
[29,30]. It also increases the risk of developing car￾diovascular disease in adulthood. A recent cohort of
pediatric patients has been studied for carotid intimal
medial thickness as a marker of atherosclerosis. This
was significantly greater in obese children diagnosed
with NAFLD, than that in the control group, indicating
that obese children with NAFLD are associated with a
greater risk of atherosclerosis and future adverse cardio￾vascular events [31].
Interestingly, it has been reported that 20–80% of
children with NAFLD can be presented and associated
with hypertriglyceridemia and/or hypercholesterolemia
[32,33]. In particular, the prevalence of NAFLD in￾creases in hyperglycemic patients, and insulin resistance
is more severe in individuals with NASH, than in those
with simple steatosis. Our group evaluated a cohort of
120 Italian children (3–18 years) with biopsy-proven
NAFLD or NASH for correlations between clinical or
biochemical variables and liver histology. Dyslipidemia
was largely diagnosed - low HDL cholesterol was found
in 45% of the population, and hypertriglyceridemia in
63%. The presence of MS or clinical and biochemical
variables associated with the syndrome were strictly re￾lated to histological features of NASH.
It is well documented that NAFLD can occur in very
young children, but it is more prevalent in adolescents
[34]. Factors that can explain the higher rate of NAFLD in
adolescents include sex hormones and insulin resistance
in puberty [35,36], or their increased control over un￾healthy food choices and sedentary lifestyle [37].
It is more common in boys than in girls [35] with a
male to female ratio of 2:1. It is possible to hypothesize
Giorgio et al. BMC Pediatrics 2013, 13:40 Page 2 of 10
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2431/13/40

that estrogens can be potentially liver-protective; or indi￾cate that androgens may aggravate NASH [38,39].
Ethnicity can also affect the prevalence of NAFLD and
has been consistently investigated across studies involving
largely multiethnic populations. NAFLD is more common
in Hispanic than in Caucasian children [20,35,40]. Ethnic
differences could possibly be due to higher rates of insulin
resistance, and to visceral adiposity at equivalent body
mass index (BMI), but also as a result of socio-economic
factors, including type of diet, exercise choice and living
location. Despite the fact that African- American children
often present more risk factors for NAFLD—including
obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus—
the rate of NAFLD in these individuals is lower [41]. It is
an area of intense research.
Histopathological pattern and New scoring systems
The pattern of the distribution of pediatric NAFLD histo￾logical lesions is frequently different from that of adults.
Classical histological findings that characterize NAFLD in
children are: steatosis, ballooning, inflammation and fibro￾sis [7]. These features have been deeply characterized else￾where [13]. Evidence of steatosis in >5% of hepatocytes is
the necessary criterion for diagnosing NAFLD both in
adults and children [42]. Steatosis distribution is the first
distinctive feature between adult and pediatric NAFLD. In
adults, steatosis starts in the perivenular zone (acinar
zone 3), whereas in children, it typically starts in the
periportal zone (acinar zone 1) or shows azonal distribu￾tion. The reason why these 2 different patterns are de￾scribed as such is still unknown [43,44]. Inflammatory
infiltrate (including lymphocytes, histiocytes or Kupffer
cells) can be present in lobules or in portal tracts of the
liver [7]. Hepatocyte ballooning is a major distinguishing
feature of NASH that confers an increased risk of disease
progression [45]. The importance of ballooning has been
emphasized by the results of the two largest randomized
trials for NAFLD treatment in adults and children, namely
The TONIC and The PIVENS trial [46,47]. Fibrosis of the
liver occurs as a response to the insult of NASH. As for
steatosis, in children, the fibrosis pattern is prevalent in
zone 1.
In 2005, Schwimmer et al. [48] categorized two preva￾lent patterns of NASH in children: the ‘adult type’, in
which steatosis has a zonal distribution prevalent in zone
3, and is associated with lobular inflammation, balloon￾ing and perisinusoidal fibrosis; and the ‘pediatric type’, in
which steatosis is associated with portal inflammation
and portal fibrosis in the absence of ballooning. Other
studies have more recently found that these patterns
can overlap in variable degrees of combination [49]. The
National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Diseases and the NASH Clinical Research Network
(CRN) Pathology Committee introduced, above the
categories of ‘not-NASH’ and ‘definite-NASH’, the cat￾egories of ‘borderline zone 1 pattern’, to describe a
NASH type with prevalent portal alteration, and of ‘bor￾derline zone 3 pattern’ in cases of prevalent alterations
in zone 3. The zone 1 NASH pattern is often seen in
children [49]. A hypothesis that may explain the hetero￾geneity in histology patterns of pediatric NASH is that
the ongoing pathology may start in zone 1, and result in
the adult pattern later in its natural history. Alterna￾tively, pediatric NASH could be a distinct pathology
from adult NASH. Further investigations are needed to
carefully characterize the disease in children.
Currently, two main scoring systems exist to evaluate
histological activity in NAFLD and NASH, and are used
both in children and adults. The Brunt score [50], based
on the semi-quantitative assessment of macrovacuolar
steatosis, ballooning, lobular and portal inflammation,
generates three-tier grades of activity: mild or grade 1;
moderate or grade 2; severe or grade 3. The other scoring
system is the NASH–CRN system [51], that generates a
numeric score for grading the disease, the so-called
NAFLD activity score (NAS). NAS results from adding
together the individual scores for steatosis (0–3), lobular
inflammation (0–3), and ballooning (0–2), range from 0
to 8. A NAS score of 1 and 2 corresponds to ‘not NASH’,
whilst a score >5 corresponds to ‘definite-NASH’. Activ￾ity scores 3 and 4 are the borderline cases. Both scoring
systems generate a numeric score for staging fibrosis:
stage 1 (perisinusoidal fibrosis); stage 2 (portal–
periportal fibrosis); stage 3 (bridging fibrosis); and stage
4 (cirrhosis).
Since the development of the original NAS score, it
has soon become evident that classifying pediatric
NASH with its distinct histopathological pattern, mainly
characterized by the presence of portal-based disease, in￾cluding portal inflammation (PI), was particularly diffi￾cult. As a matter of fact, using a NAS score, only about
half of all children could be categorized into a clear cut
pattern, while the other half fell into the “borderline”
category, supporting the need for a more reproducible
scoring system to interpret liver histology in pediatric
cases of NAFLD/NASH.
Therefore, our group studied 203 consecutive children
[52], with biopsy–proven NAFLD, aiming to develop a
new grading of a ‘specific score’ for Pediatric NAFLD, to
be used in clinical trials, which took into account the
presence of PI. This score was called the Pediatric
NAFLD Histological Score (PNHS). Histological features
were scored: steatosis (0–3), lobular inflammation (0–3),
ballooning (0–2), and PI (0–2). Our results demon￾strated that there was an excellent correlation between
PNHS scores and the presence of NASH, suggesting that
this ‘specific score’ might be considered to be used for
the histological grading of pediatric NAFLD.

Pathogenesis: present and future perspectives
NAFLD occurs in overweight and obese children, in
whom the energetic balance, normally based on the per￾fect equality of income, waste and storage has failed.
Multiple factors are probably involved in the pathogen￾etic mechanisms. All together they create a network of
interactions participating in both the development and
progression of the disease [13,14], that has been summa￾rized over a decade ago by Day et al. in the so called
“two hits hypothesis” (Figure 1). The “first hit” is repre￾sented by peripheral insulin resistance, leading to fat
accumulation in hepatocytes, and an increased lipid per￾oxidation. Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, ac￾companying obesity, lead to liver steatosis, since they
increase the absolute free-fatty-acids (FFA) uptake in the
liver, the esterification of hepatic FFAs to form triglycer￾ides (TG), the FFA synthesis from cytosolic substrates,
and the decreased apolipoprotein B-100 synthesis. Sub￾sequently, the export of FFA and TG is decreased, while
the beta-oxidation of mitochondrial long-chain fatty
acids is increased. The “second hit” is represented by
oxidative stress, which seems to explain the progression
to liver fibrosis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can in￾duce hepatocellular injury by the inhibition of the mito￾chondrial respiratory chain enzymes, the inactivation of
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and the in￾activation of membrane sodium channels. ROS further
cause lipid peroxidation, cytokine production, and in￾duce Fas Ligand, contributing to hepatocellular injury
and fibrosis. To summarize, the first step consists of the
intrahepatic accumulation of fatty acids, which is closely
associated with insulin resistance, and which increases
the susceptibility of hepatocytes to secondary injuries or
insults (oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction,
overproduction and the release of pro-inflammatory cy￾tokines, and the endotoxin-mediated activation of the
innate immune response). Increased susceptibility to
these factors might also explain the progression of
NAFLD to NASH [53,54].
Visceral adipose tissue is believed to play a pivotal role
in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, since it participates in
producing most adipokines, such as Tumor Necrosis
Factor alpha (TNF-alpha), resistin, and adiponectin,
which are involved in inducing insulin resistance and
low-grade inflammation. As a matter of fact, several
current therapeutic approaches aim at reducing visceral
adipocyte-derived adipokine and FFA overflow to the
liver, by weight loss and insulin-sensitizers.
Leptin is a satiety adipokine produced predominantly in
adipocytes [55] that regulates appetite and metabolism at
the level of the hypothalamus [56]. Most obese humans
have high circulating levels of leptin, as a result of what has
been characterized as leptin resistance. This phenomenon
of leptin resistance may already be present in obese chil￾dren [57-59]. Adiponectin is an adipose-specific hormone
that has anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing proper￾ties [60,61]. Similar to adult data, observational pediatric
studies have shown an inverse correlation between plas￾ma adiponectin concentrations and adiposity, insulin re￾sistance [62] and hepatic fat [63]. It is promising that
adiponectin is favorably modifiable by simple lifestyle
changes, and using the levels of total adiponectin, or high￾Figure 1 The “two hits” hypothesis. Transformation from NAFLD to NASH can be explained by the so called “two hit” hypothesis. The “first hit
consists of the intrahepatic accumulation of fatty acids, which is closely associated with insulin resistance, and which increases the susceptibility
of hepatocytes to secondary injuries or insults (oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, overproduction and the release of pro-inflammatory
cytokines, and the endotoxin-mediated activation of the innate immune response).

molecular-weight, adiponectin as a biomarker for insu￾lin sensitivity is gaining support. Resistin is another
adipokine that antagonizes insulin action, causing glu￾cose intolerance [64] – resistin-deficient animals are
protected from obesity – whereas elevated resistin is as￾sociated with insulin resistance [65]. Both TNF-alpha
and IL-6 are positively related to adiposity, and correl￾ate with insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease
(CVD) risk factors [66,67]. They also indirectly mediate
lipolysis and augment hepatic synthesis of fatty acids.
Studies on the effect of therapies on inflammatory fac￾tors are still limited, except for a few studies on IL-6
and TNF-alpha [68-70]. Further interventional trials are
awaited to clarify the link among adipokines, NAFLD,
MS and CVD.
Genetic predisposition
Evidence that only a minority of patients with NAFLD
progress to NASH suggests that disease progression is
likely to depend on complex interplay between environ￾mental factors and genetic predisposition. The patho￾genesis of NAFLD appears to be multifactorial, involving
both genetic and environmental factors. Two recent co￾hort studies and one community-based study in different
ethnicities estimated that the heritability of NAFLD
could approach 35–40% of the total predisposition, even
after adjusting for age, gender, race and BMI [71,72].
Several genetic variants in the genes involved in energy
balance, such as adiponutrin/patatin-like phospholipase
domain-containing 3 (PNPLA3), and apolipoprotein C3
(APOC3), or in genes involved in inflammation, oxida￾tive stress and fibrogenesis, such as SOD2, have been
demonstrated to be associated with NAFLD and the se￾verity of liver damage. The association of the PNPLA3
variant with NAFLD in obese children and adolescents
has been deeply characterized. Similarly to obese adults,
the PNPLA3 variant confers genetic susceptibility to
liver damage as identified by increased ALT and AST
liver enzyme levels in young patients. There was no rela￾tionship of the PNPLA3 variant with insulin sensitivity,
BMI or serum triglycerides, but a close relationship was
demonstrated between the PNPLA3 variant and the in￾creased central obesity in obese children, as determined
by waist circumference, which contributes to liver dam￾age in children with NAFLD [73].
Since accumulating evidence had suggested the involve￾ment of the endocannabinoid-system in liver disease and
related complications, our group [74] has recently studied
the hepatoprotective properties for Cannabinoid Receptor
type 2 (CB2) in a cohort of 118 obese Italian children with
biopsy proven NAFLD. We have found that whereas the
CB2 Q63R variant was not associated with steatosis or fi￾brosis, it was associated with the severity of the inflamma￾tion (P = 0.002), and the presence of NASH (P = 0.02),
suggesting a critical role for the CB2 Q63R variant in
modulating the hepatic inflammation state in obese chil￾dren, and in the consequent increased predisposition of
these patients to develop liver damage.
Several ongoing studies on the genetic predisposition
for NAFLD, by different research groups, will certainly
and soon help in the identification of new molecular tar￾gets for the pharmacological treatment of NAFLD.
Diagnosis
A recent position paper by the ESPGHAN hepatology
committee [75] has clarified the diagnostic approach to
NAFLD in childhood, describing the role of different
tests, including liver biopsy. NAFLD is more frequent in
children aged more than 10 years, and is usually present
with overweight/obesity. The diagnosis of NAFLD needs
the recognition of fatty liver, and the exclusion of other
causes of steatosis. Liver biopsy is the current gold
standard for the diagnosis of NAFLD, and it is the only
way to distinguish between NASH and simple steatosis,
and to determine the severity of liver damage and the
presence and extent of fibrosis, as well as to rule out
other diagnoses such as autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson
disease and metabolic diseases [76]. However, since li￾ver biopsy is an invasive procedure, it is usually not
performed as a first step. Primary noninvasive evaluation
(biochemical parameters, imaging tests and serum bio￾markers) should be used as initial tools to confirm the
diagnosis of fatty liver disease, especially in the typical
patient with characteristics of MS. The current diagnos￾tic laboratory workup used for the diagnosis of pediatric
NAFLD is discussed in Table 1.
Liver function blood tests and imaging techniques
(US, CT, MRI) are commonly used as indirect markers
of liver steatosis. None of these have proven to be reli￾able, and the sensitivity and the specificity are undeter￾mined. Aminotransferases are used, together with the
measurement of accessible serum parameters such as
glucose, triglyceride, cholesterol, lipoproteins, glucose/
insulin levels after tolerance tests, and glycated hemo￾globin HbA1c (Table 1), to assess NAFLD diagnosis and
to screen children from possible hepatopathy-related
metabolic complications, such as MS. These measure￾ments must be combined with the evaluation of
anthropometric parameters – BMI, abdominal circum￾ference – and with other information such as the pa￾tient’s gender and the health state and lifestyle of the
relatives. Generally, the AST: ALT ratio is less than 1,
but this value can increase as fibrosis progresses. Circu￾lating levels of aminotransferases can fluctuate over time
and are normal (<0.67 μkat/l) in a large number of chil￾dren with NAFLD and NASH [77,78]. Normal levels of
serum aminotransferases do not exclude the presence
of fibrosis or even cirrhosis. Serum levels of alkaline

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2431/13/40

phosphatase and GGT can also be slightly elevated in
pediatric NAFLD. Moreover, positive antinuclear anti￾body and smooth muscle antibody (SMA) titers can be
found in 15.4%, and in 10% of patients, respectively.
Positive autoantibodies have been associated with the
higher fibrosis stages [79].
Since patients with NAFLD are often present with
some components of MS, lipid profiles, as well as fasting
glucose and insulin levels, should always be verified [80].
Albumin, bilirubin, and platelet serum levels are usually
normal unless the patient is developing cirrhosis.
Identifying and validating potential novel noninvasive
biomarkers of NAFLD and NASH is a central area of re￾search. The pediatric NAFLD fibrosis index (PNFI),
which is obtained from three simple measurements—
age, waist circumference and triglyceride levels—has
been developed to predict liver fibrosis in children with
NAFLD [81]. This index is easy to calculate with no add￾itional cost to the patient, and it has a good positive pre￾dictive value to predict fibrosis; however, its negative
predictive value to rule out fibrosis is suboptimal. These
limitations can be overcome when used in a sequential
algorithm with the enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) test,
which uses a combination of three extracellular matrix
components (namely hyaluronic acid, amino-terminal
propeptide of type III collagen and TIMP1), resulting in
an accurate assessment of the presence of liver fibrosis
in children [82]. Future studies are still needed to exter￾nally cross-validate these findings, before the combin￾ation of PNFI and ELF can be recommended in children
with NAFLD. Some evidence has demonstrated the
utility of a measurement of plasma levels of a specific
byproduct of apoptosis in liver cells—caspase-generated
cytokeratin 18 fragments—in the diagnosis of NASH in
adults [83]. In 2010, Fitzpatrick et al. [84] demonstrated
that children with biopsy-proven NAFLD also showed
considerably elevated levels of these cytokeratin 18 frag￾ments when compared with healthy controls. These re￾sults suggest that measuring cytokeratin 18 fragments
could be useful in the work-up of children suspected of
having NASH. Larger validation studies are, however,
still needed.
Imaging techniques
Liver ultrasonography is the most commonly used im￾aging diagnostic modality, largely because it is relatively
inexpensive, widely available and is user-friendly [85].
Liver ultrasonography can provide a good estimate of
the degree, or the extent of hepatic steatosis that is
present, based on a series of ultrasonographical charac￾teristics. Shannon and colleagues [86] demonstrated that
liver ultrasonography is a useful tool for quantifying
steatosis in pediatric patients who have suspected
NAFLD; ultrasonography scores strongly correlate with
the grade of steatosis when conducting a liver biopsy.
Unfortunately, the diagnostic sensitivity of ultrasonog￾raphy decreases, either when the liver contains <30% of
fat, or in individuals with a BMI of 40 or more [87]. Fur￾thermore, ultrasonography cannot rule out the presence
of steatohepatitis or fibrosis. Overall the sensitivity of
ultrasound in NAFLD ranges from 60% to 94%, with
specificity from 84% to 100%.

Computed tomography is more specific, but is not
used for the screening of fatty liver in obese children for
obvious limitations related to radiation exposure. Mag￾netic resonance imaging (MRI) and 1H-MRS have the
greatest accuracy to determine hepatic fat content, but
are rarely used due to the high costs.
The FibroscanW uses transient elastography to evaluate
fibrosis. It correlates well with liver fibrosis on histology
in studies in both adults and children. In one study
conducted by our group, 67 consecutive children and ado￾lescents with NAFLD were studied [88]. Multilevel likeli￾hood ratios were used to explore the whole spectrum of
transient elastography measurements in relation to the de￾gree of fibrosis. We demonstrated that values over 5 kPa
could predict the presence of fibrosis. More recently,
Fitzpatrick and colleagues [89] have shown that Transient
Elastography is a reliable tool in distinguishing different
stages of liver fibrosis in paediatric patients, even if it is
best performed in children with an autoimmune liver dis￾ease, and in those post-transplant, than in those with
NAFLD with whom fibrosis had to be excluded. There￾fore, FibroscanW can be useful, but it is not yet sufficient
enough in non-invasively monitoring the liver disease pro￾gression in children.
To summarize, as shown in Table 1, the differential
diagnosis of NAFLD should be based first on clinical fea￾tures, then on noninvasive tests, and finally on liver bi￾opsy. Other causes of chronic liver disease including
hepatitis B and C, Wilson disease, alpha-1-antitrypsin
deficiency, autoimmune hepatitis, cystic fibrosis and
drug toxicity, and should always be excluded. Alcohol
abuse must always be questioned. Especially in young
children (less than 3 years), a detailed diagnosis for
metabolic causes of fatty infiltrations in the liver should
be performed (Table 1).
Prevention and treatment
Because of the limited knowledge of the molecular patho￾genesis of NAFLD, the current therapeutic modalities con￾sist of strategies aimed at decreasing the incidence of the
known risk factors. Interventions including community in￾volvement are useful in improving health at individual and
public health level. Prevention and control of modifiable
risk factors as overweight and unhealthy lifestyle, along
with primordial prevention by good pregnancy care -for
prevention of low birth weight- and encouraging breast
feeding, can impact the overall health of children and ado￾lescents as well as the prevention and control of pediatric
NAFLD and the related metabolic syndrome.
The few existing therapeutic strategies are typically not
based on drugs, and currently there is no treatment
targeting the disease per se. Lifestyle changes and pharma￾cological treatment have been deeply discussed elsewhere
[90]. However, several international groups, based on new
pathogenetic paradigms, have recently launched novel
clinical trials, combining non-pharmacologic and pharma￾cological approaches, in an innovative multi-targeted plan.
Therapies that simultaneously target the clinical features
of NAFLD and NASH (such as dietary interventions to re￾duce obesity) and molecular mechanisms (such as agents
that are effective against the secondary injuries or insults
as described above) could be employed. We seriously con￾sider that multi-targeted therapy could be the way for￾ward for treating these children (Figure 2). Such therapy
consists of combinations of the therapeutic approaches
directed against various potential targets. Recently, inter￾esting dietary supplements such as probiotics and long￾chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have been
adopted in adults with NAFLD [91,92]. Interestingly,
these dietary supplements, although considered phar￾macological interventions, are often based on natural
Figure 2 Proposed treatment schedule in pediatric NAFLD. Multi-targeted therapy could be the way forward for treating children with
NAFLD. Such therapy consists of combinations of the therapeutic approaches directed against various potential targets added to intervention on
lifestyle and diet. Psychological therapies could improve adherence to therapies.

compounds present in specific foods (yogurt, fish oil, etc.).
Among the pathogenetic factors leading to NAFLD, the
persistent crosstalk among the gut, the immune system,
and the liver, plays a pivotal role [93]. In fact, it is now
accepted that specific nutrients increase the intestinal per￾meability to bacterial endotoxins, activating an immune￾mediated inflammatory response of liver resident cells,
leading to a profibrogenic phenotype [94]. One recent
study on animal models [95], has demonstrated a pivotal
role of restoring gut microflora in protecting the liver from
fat and preventing cardiovascular disease. As demonstrated
in genetic animal models with dyslipidemia, low grade in￾testinal inflammation can drive steatosis to steatohepatitis.
Performing an intervention on intestinal microbiota using
probiotics can modulate the expression of nuclear recep￾tors, correcting insulin resistance in the liver and the adi￾pose tissues and protecting against the development of
steatohepatitis. Randomized placebo controlled trials on
the use of probiotics in NAFLD are ongoing in humans.
Furthermore, studies in experimental models have
shown that long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, known as
important regulators of hepatic gene transcription, can
decrease liver steatosis, improve insulin sensitivity, and
decrease markers of inflammation [92]. Recently, Nobili
et al. [96] reported the results of a randomized clini￾cal trial based on the use of an omega-3 fatty acid,
docosahexaenoic acid. A 6-months docosahexaenoic acid
supplementation to the diet, together with physical exer￾cise, ameliorated the body mass index, the insulin sensi￾tivity index, serum ALT and triacylglycerol levels, and
steatosis at ultrasound.
Review
In several recently published works, in large cohorts of
overweight and obese children and adolescents from both
the western and eastern worlds, NAFLD has emerged to
be extremely prevalent and predicted by obesity and male
gender. This data underlines the epidemiological dimen￾sion of this obesity-related morbidity, even in childhood,
inducing one to recommend at least ALT as a screening
parameter in basic care. Once NAFLD is diagnosed, it is
nowadays compulsory to prescribe lifestyle changes and
dietary interventions to reduce pediatric obesity, but also
to consider new treatment approaches that simultaneously
target the clinical features and i) the molecular mecha￾nisms (such as agents that are effective against the second￾ary injuries or insults) ii) the crosstalk among the gut, the
immune system, and the liver, in view of the so called
NAFLD multi-targeted therapy.
Conclusions
An early recognition of NAFLD may help when inter￾vening at a younger age, which may reduce future mor￾bidity and mortality from the disease. As a matter of
fact, the effects of a modern low-cost diet (with high-fat,
high-sugar, high-salt, energy-dense and micronutrient￾poor foods) will make children experience, in the next
10–20 years, the highest incidence of an “obesity epi￾demic” and obesity-related diseases. This has prompted
a new sense of urgency, to find novel and early preven￾tion strategies during childhood, to start an efficient pri￾mary prevention process.
