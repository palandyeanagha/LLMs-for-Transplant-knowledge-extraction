Abstract
In the present study, it was shown that physiologically rele￾vant levels of the proinflammatory cytokine TNFa induced
apoptosis in rat cardiomyocytes in vitro, as quantified by
single cell microgel electrophoresis of nuclei (“cardiac com￾ets”) as well as by morphological and biochemical criteria.
It was also shown that TNFa stimulated production of the
endogenous second messenger, sphingosine, suggesting sphin￾golipid involvement in TNFa-mediated cardiomyocyte apop￾tosis. Consistent with this hypothesis, sphingosine strongly
induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. The ability of the appro￾priate stimulus to drive cardiomyocytes into apoptosis indi￾cated that these cells were primed for apoptosis and were
susceptible to clinically relevant apoptotic triggers, such as
TNFa. These findings suggest that the elevated TNFa
levels seen in a variety of clinical conditions, including sep￾sis and ischemic myocardial disorders, may contribute to
TNFa-induced cardiac cell death. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis
is also discussed in terms of its potential beneficial role in
limiting the area of cardiac cell involvement as a conse￾quence of myocardial infarction, viral infection, and pri￾mary cardiac tumors. (J. Clin. Invest. 1996. 98:2854–2865)

Introduction
Apoptosis is a mechanism by which cells respond to damage
by triggering a program of cell death (1–4). Apoptosis has only
recently been recognized as a component of many common
cardiac pathologies, including chronic heart failure, cardiac
sudden death, viral myocarditis, and ischemia (5–13). Since the
triggers and cellular mechanisms leading to cardiac cell apop￾tosis are not known, an understanding of this recently discov￾ered form of cardiac cell death may help elucidate many com￾mon types of heart disease.
Serum levels of TNFa are elevated in many human cardiac￾related pathogenic conditions, including heart failure (14–17).
Because TNFa can trigger apoptosis in many cell types (18–20),
it is possible that endogenous TNFa may contribute to apopto￾sis in cardiac cells. Since TNFa may be produced by cardiac
cells themselves (21, 22), it is possible that local concentrations
of TNFa are high in cardiac tissue relative to serum levels. Sig￾nificantly, we and others have shown that TNFa receptors are
expressed by cardiomyocytes (23, 24). The “death domain” of
the prominent type I receptor (TNFRI)1
 present in cardiomyo￾cytes has been linked to TNFa-mediated apoptosis in nonmus￾cle cells (25), suggesting that TNFa acting via the TNFRI could
also mediate myocardial cell apoptosis. Since the sphingomye￾lin signal transduction system has been linked to the TNFRI in
other cell types (26), we hypothesize that many of the actions
of TNFa on cardiac cells, including apoptosis, could be medi￾ated by TNFa-induced sphingolipid production.
We have taken the approach of using several techniques in
parallel to evaluate apoptosis in cardiomyocytes in vitro, fol￾lowing treatment with TNFa and sphingolipids. These tech￾niques include the in situ 39 nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay,
the “laddering” of extracted DNA after agarose gel electro￾phoresis, as well as morphological criteria. In addition, we
have employed the microgel electrophoresis method (27) (of￾ten referred to as the “comet assay”) (28, 29), which is a rela￾tively new technique for distinguishing apoptosis from necro￾sis. This technique can detect DNA damage earlier than other
methods, and it can differentiate single from double-strand
breaks and thus be specific for apoptosis (29–31). Moreover,
the comet assay lends itself to the examination of a large num￾ber of cells. As a result of its utility, the comet assay has been
employed by a number of laboratories to assess apoptosis in
several cell types (27, 28, 32–36). This broad range of criteria
to assess apoptosis in cultured rat cardiomyocytes has been
used in this study to determine whether cardiomyocyte death
triggered by TNFa and sphingolipids results from apoptosis or
necrosis.
Methods
Neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes were isolated as described
previously and cultured in DMEM-F12/10% FCS (37). Adult ven￾tricular myocardial cells were cultured after dissociation from adult
rat hearts as previously described (38), with the following modifica￾tion: after the last perfusion with collagenase (type II; Worthington
Biochemicals Corp., Freehold, NJ), rat ventricles were diced and
incubated for 30 additional min at 378C in 10–15 ml of 0.52 mg/ml
collagenase in oxygenated Tyrode’s solution (140 mmol/liter NaCl,
5.4 mmol/liter KCl, 5.0 mmol/liter MgCl2
, 10 mmol/liter Hepes, 0.25
mmol/liter NaH2PO4
, pH 7.3) in which the CaCl2
 concentration had
been adjusted to 0.06 mmol/liter, before culturing cells in the physio￾logical calcium levels present in the culture and incubation media (1.0

mmol/liter CaCl2). The acutely dissociated myocardial cells were
plated on laminin-coated (50 mg/ml) frosted microscope slides or on
coverslips and cultured in DMEM-F12/10% FCS in the presence or
absence of the test agent. These procedures result in a high percent￾age of viable cells, since necrotic cells supercontract in the presence
of high calcium concentrations and do not adhere well to the sub￾strate.
Apoptosis in cardiomyocytes was quantified by the single-cell mi￾crogel electrophoresis (comet assay) (27, 28, 36, 39). The comet assay
is a method of measuring DNA strand breaks and has been used to
quantify apoptotic cells from other tissues (31). In comparison with
other methods of detecting apoptosis, the comet assay is considered
more sensitive and able to detect DNA cleavage earlier than other
methods (29, 30). The comet assay was performed essentially as de￾scribed (39) with the following modifications: cells were cultured on
frosted microscope slides, treated with the test agent (e.g., TNFa,
sphingosine, H2O2
, ceramide, anti–TNFRI Ab), and then embedded
in situ in 1% agarose (SeaKem Gold; FMC Bioproducts, Rockland,
ME). Cardiomyocytes were then placed in refrigerated alkaline lysis
buffer (2.5 M NaCl, 1% Na-lauryl sarcosinate, 100 mM EDTA, 10 mM
Tris base, 1% peroxide, and carbonyl-free Triton X-100) for 30 min,
followed by 15 min unwinding in electrophoresis buffer containing
300 mM NaOH, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% hydroxyquinoline, 0.02%
DMSO, pH 10.0. The nuclei were subsequently electrophoresed for
5 min at 2 V/cm, followed by staining with YOYO-1 (3 mmol/liter;
Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and visualization with a fluores￾cence microscope equipped with an FITC filter cube (Olympus Corp.,
Lake Success, NY). For quantification and image analysis of comet
fields, fluorescent images of the nuclei were captured by a PULNIX
TN-745 CCD camera connected to an Olympus BA-2 fluorescence
microscope and digitally processed by KOMET software (Kinetic Im￾aging, Ltd., Liverpool, UK). Between 450 and 500 comets per treat￾ment were scored and assigned into type A, B, or C categories (see
Results), based on their tail moments (Table I). The tail moment is
defined as the product of the comet tail length (distance between the
mean of DNA fluorescence for the comet head and the end of the
tail) and the proportion of DNA in tail (proportion of total fluores￾cence found in the tail region) divided by 100 (30). The tail moment
parameter has been used to distinguish nucleosomal DNA fragmen￾tation of apoptotic cells from DNA damage of those undergoing ne￾crosis, and is a better discriminator than assessing comet tail length
(36). According to Olive et al. (30), classification of individual cells
into the various types of comets (e.g., B vs. C) “by eye” is the most ac￾curate means of analyzing and quantifying large numbers of apop￾totic cells. This was substantiated in the present study by experiments
in which the percentage of apoptotic nuclei (type C comets) scored by
eye were compared with the same data quantified by image analysis
using the criteria of tail moment (see Table II in Results). Conse￾quently, in many experiments, even though tail moments were calcu￾lated for numerous control and treated nuclei in the A, B, and C cate￾gories, the number of apoptotic cells in a particular experiment was
commonly assessed by counting the number of nuclei exhibiting puffy
tail type comets with pinhead nuclear remnants (type C comets, e.g.,
Fig. 3 C). Statistical analyses employed the Student’s t test, Mantel￾Haenszel Chi Square trend analysis, and ANOVA using Microsoft
Excel and SPSS software.
In addition to the comet assay, double-stranded DNA breaks
were assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis of extracted cellular
DNA and the presence of characteristic 180–200-bp multiple oligonu￾cleosomal fragmentation (40).
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transfer-mediated end labeling of
fragmented nuclei (TUNEL assay) was performed on cardiomyo￾cytes that had been plated on laminin-coated coverslips and cultured
in DMEM-F12/10% FCS in the presence or absence of the test agent.
The in situ TUNEL assay was then performed in accordance with the
manufacturer’s protocol for cultured cells (Boehringer Mannheim
Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) after fixing the cells in 4% parafor￾maldehyde for 30–60 min.
Morphological identification of apoptotic nuclei was assessed ei￾ther by hematoxylin or ethidium bromide staining. For hematoxylin
staining, cells were first treated with cold acetone (2208C), rinsed in
cold PBS, and then stained for 20 min. For ethidium bromide stain￾ing, cultured cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, treated with
RNAse A (0.1%) at 378C for 30 min, followed by ethidium bromide
treatment (50 mg/ml for 15 min). Ethidium bromide–stained cells
were viewed by fluorescence microscopy using a rhodamine filter
cube.
HPLC analysis of TNFa-induced sphingolipid production by rat
cardiac membranes was performed essentially as described previ￾ously (41). Cardiac membranes were isolated from adult rat ventricles
as described (23). Freshly isolated membranes were incubated for 90
min in the absence (control) or presence of TNFa. The membranes
were then extracted for sphingolipids and processed for HPLC sepa￾ration and quantification as previously described (41).
Reverse transcriptase PCR of TNFRI in adult and neonatal rat
ventricular cells was performed essentially as described previously by
us (23). Briefly, DNAse-treated poly (A1) RNA obtained from total
RNA was reverse transcribed and the resultant cDNA amplified (30
cycles) by PCR using a programmable thermal cycler (PTC-100;
MJ Research, Watertown, MA). Sense and antisense primers for rat
TNFRI were 59-GCTCCTGGCTCTGCTGAT-39 and 59-AACAT￾TTCTTTCCGACAT-39, respectively. Primers for atrial natriuretic
factor, 59-AGCGGGGGCGGCACTTAG-39 (sense), and 59-CTC￾CAATCCTGTCAATCC-39 were included as a positive control for
myocardial gene expression. Primers were synthesized in the San Di￾ego State University Microchemical Core Facility. The reverse tran￾scriptase PCR product was separated on a 2% agarose gel. The sizes
of the amplification products for rat TNFRI and atrial natriuretic fac￾tor were 288 and 212 bp, respectively.
Results
We hypothesize that TNFa and sphingolipids are capable of
driving rat cardiomyocytes into apoptosis. We present results
from in vitro studies using cultured cardiomyocytes exposed to
TNFa and to the lipid second messengers, sphingosine, sphin￾gosine-1-phosphate, and ceramide. To assess apoptosis in car￾diomyocytes, we employed a multiplicity of techniques, includ￾ing single-cell microgel electrophoresis (comet assay), the in
situ TUNEL assay, and laddering of extracted DNA after aga￾rose gel electrophoresis in addition to conventional cytological
methods. Trypan blue exclusion and other criteria were also
used to determine if cardiomyocytes succumb by necrosis

rather than by the apoptotic process when subjected to TNFa
and sphingolipid triggers. Hydrogen peroxide was employed as
a positive control for induction of single strand breaks.
Assessment of apoptosis in cardiomyocytes using single-cell
microgel electrophoresis (the comet assay). The sphingolipid,
ceramide, was chosen for our initial evaluation of sphingolipid￾induced apoptosis in cardiac myocytes since ceramide is a well
established inducer of apoptosis in nonmuscle cells and is
thought to be a significant second messenger mediating apop￾tosis triggered by cytokines such as TNFa and by other agents
(42). To measure apoptosis in cardiomyocytes, a very sensitive
and relatively new method, the comet assay, was used in these
studies. The comet assay has been employed by many labora￾tories as a sensitive method of assessing DNA fragmentation
(27, 28, 32–36), but has not been applied to cardiomyocyte cell
death. In this report, the comet assay was used to evaluate apop￾tosis in both adult and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Cultured
cardiomyocytes were embedded in agarose, lysed, and electro￾phoresed (see Methods). As a result of conditions that pro￾mote unwinding, DNA fragments are free to migrate in the
agarose away from the nucleus forming an image that resem￾bles a comet tail (Fig. 1). The pattern of DNA fragmentation
detected by the comet assay has been used to distinguish the
double-stranded DNA cleavage commonly accompanying
apoptosis from the random breaks often seen in necrosis or
produced by genotoxic agents (29–31). To compare putative
apoptosis produced by sphingolipids to genotoxic/necrotic
damage, we incubated cardiomyocytes for 20 min with 100
mmol/liter H2O2
, a treatment that is often used to induce ran￾dom single-strand DNA breaks (36, 43) (Fig. 1 A). This treat￾ment produced comets with small tails, with most of the DNA
unfragmented and remaining in the nucleus. Incubation of
cardiomyocytes with the sphingolipid C2 ceramide produced
a distinct comet pattern characterized by a puffy comet tail
disconnected from the remnant nucleus (Fig. 1 B), a pattern
of DNA fragmentation that is characteristic of apoptosis ex￾hibited by other cell types and has been attributed to double￾strand breaks (29–31).
Fig. 2 A shows a field of control (untreated) myocardial
cells and Fig. 2 B shows a field of C2 ceramide–treated cells,
demonstrating that the comet assay can be used to evaluate
the effects of apoptotic-inducing agents on large numbers of
cells. One can readily see from the density of nuclei in Fig. 2 A
vs. 2 B that approximately the same number of cells survived
the ceramide treatment and thus direct quantitative compari￾sons can be made between treatment conditions. Nuclei from
untreated, non-apoptotic cells (Fig. 2A) appeared as spheroids
after electrophoresis. On the other hand, fields of C2 cera￾mide–treated cells displayed a full range of comet types
(Fig. 2 B). The amount and type of DNA damage in each nu￾cleus was assessed by image analysis and “by eye,” as discussed
in Methods. Nuclei from untreated, nonapoptotic cells had no
tails and consequently most cells displayed negligible tail mo￾ments (mean 0.47 mm in these experiments). Electrophoresed
nuclei classified by us as type A nuclei displayed little damage
and had tail moments in the range of 0–3 mm (Fig. 3 A and Ta￾ble I). The nuclei resembling comets resulting from ceramide
or other apoptosis inducers (see below) were of two general
types that could be distinguished visually and quantitatively by
their tail moments and are referred to as types B and C com￾ets. Type B comets were those nuclei that had a developing tail
but with a substantial amount of unfragmented DNA present
in the “head” of the comet (mean tail moments of 5.43 mm,
range 3–8 mm, Fig. 3 B and Table I). Type C comets were those
nuclei with the apoptotic-associated pattern previously ob￾served (29–31), a characteristic puffy tail separated by a space
from the pinhead remnant of the head (e.g., Fig. 3 C), and hav￾ing tail moments in the 8–30 mm range with mean values of
13.6 mm (Table I). Table I gives a comparison of image analy￾sis-derived tail moment measurements in our system for types
A, B, and C nuclei.
Based on this data, we concluded that, with the extensive
amount of DNA fragmentation observed in our studies after
treatment of cardiac myocytes with C2 ceramide (Fig. 3 D),
use of the comet assay was a rapid and effective method of
evaluating apoptosis. Moreover, this first demonstration of ce￾ramide-triggered apoptosis in cardiomyocytes suggested that
the heart might be susceptible to other well characterized apop￾totic triggers, such as TNFa or other cytokines.
TNFa induces apoptosis but not necrosis in adult rat cardi￾omyocytes. When primary rat cardiomyocytes were analyzed
by the comet assay after an 18-h incubation with 4 nmol/liter
TNFa (recombinant rat TNFa from Biosource, Camarillo,
CA), substantial apoptosis was evident (Fig. 3 D). For control
(untreated) cells, nearly 80% of the nuclei appeared as sphe￾roids, categorized as type A (Fig. 3 D). In contrast, over 60%
of nuclei in TNFa-treated cells yielded comets typical of apop￾tosis (type C) with pinhead nuclear remnants, and puffy tails

and tail moments in the 8–30 mm range. The cardiomyocyte
DNA fragmentation pattern we observed was likely due in
large part to double-strand DNA breaks typical of apoptosis,
since extensive comet formation was observed using the dou￾ble-strand break-specific neutral comet assay (30) (data not
shown). The percentage of type C comets was linearly depen￾dent on the concentration of TNFa in the 1–4 nmol/liter range
(Fig. 4), reaching a maximum effect (61% apoptotic cells) at
4 nmol/liter TNFa (3,500 U/ml, 68 pg/ml), and then declining
somewhat at 5 nmol/liter (4,250 U/ml, 85 pg/ml). The half￾maximal concentration of TNFa required to induce apoptosis
in our cardiomyocytes was 2.2 nmol/liter (1,870 U/ml, 37.4

pg/ml). The reason for the statistically significant (P , 0.001,
Students t test) decline in the ability of TNFa to induce apop￾tosis at 5 nM TNFa is unknown, but may result from down￾regulation of the receptor by receptor–mediated endocytosis,
which would reduce cell responsiveness to TNFa. The percent￾age of type C comets shown in Fig. 4 was determined by eye
(see Methods), and comparison measurements of tail moment
were made using a subset of the same cells. This comparison is
displayed in Table II and shows that the percent apoptotic nu￾clei determined by characterizing the cells by eye was nearly
identical to determinations characterizing the cells using the
tail moment calculated by computerized image analysis. Fig. 4
also shows that z 5% of untreated cells in culture display apop￾totic type comets. This basal level of apoptosis in control cell
cultures likely results from the harsh manner in which cells are
prepared for culture (i.e., collagenase treatment of Langen￾dorff-perfused hearts). The data in Fig. 5 indicate that the ex￾tent of apoptosis produced by TNFa was dependent on the ex￾posure time of cells to the cytokine. This figure shows that
from 12 to 18 h, 4 nmol/liter TNFa progressively drove an in￾creasing number of cells into apoptosis as judged by the steady
increase in type C comets and the concomitant decrease in
type A undamaged nuclei. ANOVA performed on these data
showed that there was a significant (P , 0.001) time-depen￾dent effect of TNFa on the adult cardiomyocytes. Since 12 h of
incubation was needed for TNFa to induce significant apopto￾sis (P , 0.001), it is likely that some protein synthesis was re￾quired to complete the death program.
To demonstrate that the TNFa-induced apoptosis was me￾diated by the TNFRI, which we have recently identified as the
prominent receptor subtype found on rat cardiomyocytes (23),
we incubated adult rat cardiomyocytes overnight with 2.5 mg/ml
anti–sTNFRI (mAb clone 16803.1 supplied by R & D Systems
Inc., Minneapolis, MN), and then subjected the cells to the
comet assay. As seen by the data presented in Table III, the
anti–TNFa receptor antibody, when added alone, was capable
of driving a significant (P , 0.0001, Student’s t test) number of
adult cardiomyocytes into apoptosis (51.9%). The extent of
apoptosis produced by antibody interaction with the receptor
was comparable with that produced by TNFa (47.6%), and no
significant additive effect was seen when cells were incubated

with TNFa and the antibody in combination (42.9% apoptotic
cells).
Evidence for TNFa-induced apoptosis demonstrated by the
comet assay was further substantiated by in situ terminal deox￾ynucleotide transfer–mediated labeling of TNFa-treated cardi￾omyocytes (Fig. 6 A), although this method cannot distinguish
random single- from double-strand DNA cleavage, as does the
comet assay. In one experiment, we directly compared the
TUNEL assay performed on a duplicate set of cultured cells
processed for the comet assay after treatment with TNFa. The
TUNEL assay showed that 32.5% of the TNFa-treated cells had
strong enough fluorescent signals to be counted as apoptotic,
compared with . 60% apoptotic nuclei determined by the
comet assay using similar conditions of TNFa treatment (Fig. 3
D). Thus, the TUNEL assay appears to be somewhat less sen￾sitive than the comet in assessing apoptosis in cardiomyocytes.

An important feature of apoptosis that distinguishes
apoptosis from necrosis is maintenance of plasma membrane
integrity (1–3). Apoptotic adult cardiomyocytes such as those
displayed in Fig. 6 A demonstrated substantial DNA fragmen￾tation, but often retained their rod-shaped appearance indi￾cative of intact plasma membranes. In this experiment, a
TUNEL-positive cell was examined under bright field to con￾firm that DNA damage had occurred in a rod-shaped cell. The
otherwise normal appearance of the cell not only confirmed
that this cardiomyocyte underwent apoptosis while maintain￾ing the integrity of its plasma membrane, but also suggested
that the rod-shaped cardiomyocytes displaying apoptotic signs
were not necrotic. Over 50% of such cells retained their rod￾shaped appearance and were not “supercontracted” in the
presence of millimolar Ca21, as would be the case for perme￾abilized necrotic cells. Supercontracture results from the cardi￾omyocyte’s unique sensitivity to changes in plasmalemma
Ca21 permeability and can be used as an additional discrimina￾tor between apoptosis and necrosis. In the necrotic myocyte,
characterized by loss of membrane integrity, the uncontrolled
influx of Ca21 down a steep electrochemical gradient results in
supercontracture of the cell. The subsequent “balled-up” mor￾phology and loss of defined cell structure can be clearly distin￾guished from the normal rod-shaped myocyte seen in Fig. 6 A.
Apoptotic cells such as the one displayed in Fig 6 A are not
easily distinguished morphologically from untreated rod￾shaped cells such as the hemotoxylin and eosin–stained cells
shown in Fig. 6 B. While rod-shaped apoptotic cells are com￾mon, occasionally apoptotic cells appear shrunken with evi￾dence of membrane blebbing more characteristic of apoptotic
cells from nonmuscle tissue (Fig. 6 C). A comparison of panels
A, B, and C illustrates that apoptotic cardiomyocytes can ap￾pear either rod-shaped or crenated (also see Fig. 6, legend),
and these morphological variations may reflect different stages
of the apoptotic process. While the cell shown in Fig. 6 C was
clearly apoptotic, as judged by the presence of membrane
blebbing, this appearance was not a common feature of adult
cardiomyocytes driven into apoptosis by TNFa or other trig￾gers, and likely represents a cell in an advanced stage of apop￾tosis. Additionally, cells such as this one were found to exclude
trypan blue and to respond to Ca21 ionophores, providing fur￾ther evidence that they were not necrotic. In general, . 80%
of cells induced into apoptosis were found to supercontract after
challenge with the Ca21 ionophore, A23187, suggesting that
the cell membranes were intact and not permeable to Ca21 be￾fore ionophore addition. As a further check of cell membrane
integrity a subset of cell fields was examined for indo-1 fluores￾cence. Cells are permeable to indo-1 AM, which is subse￾quently de-esterified in the cell to an impermeant Ca21-sensi￾tive species. Without exception, the same cells that excluded
trypan blue and responded to the ionophore also retained
and fluoresced the Ca21-sensitive fluorescent dye, indo-1 AM.
TNFa activates the sphingomyelin signal transduction cas￾cade. Because it has been demonstrated that TNFa may pro￾duce apoptosis in a variety of cell types, principally through
ceramide production (18, 19) or via ceramide’s conversion
product, sphingosine (20), it is possible that TNFa-mediated
cardiac apoptosis may result from enhanced sphingolipid pro￾duction. When cardiac membranes were exposed to TNFa,
substantial (1.57-fold) sphingosine production was observed
(Fig. 7), suggesting that this lipid may be an important mediator
of the effects of TNFa in cardiac tissue. Consistent with this hy￾pothesis, treatment of primary cardiomyocytes with sphingosine
(10 mmol/liter) for 18 h resulted in characteristic apoptotic￾type comets in almost all (95%) of the cardiomyocytes ob￾served (Fig. 3 D). The cell permeant ceramide analog, C2 ceram￾ide (10 mmol/liter), was somewhat less effective in stimulating
cardiomyocytes to undergo apoptosis, with only 32% apoptotic￾type comets produced (Fig. 3 D). Sphingosine also produced the
characteristic morphological changes that are hallmarks of apop￾tosis, including nuclear condensation and membrane blebbing
(Fig. 6 C). In neonatal cardiomyocytes, sphingosine produced oli￾gonucleosomal DNA laddering and prominent pyknotic nuclear
fragmentation patterns characteristic of apoptosis (see below).
To confirm that the adult cardiomyocytes treated with
sphingosine were not necrotic, trypan blue exclusion was em￾ployed as an indicator of plasma membrane permeability (Ta￾ble IV). Over 80% of sphingosine-treated cells excluded trypan

blue after 18 h in culture. Since these same conditions caused
more than 95% of the cells to become apoptotic as judged by
the comet assay (Fig. 3 D), sphingosine must induce apoptosis
without appreciable signs of necrosis. This conclusion is sup￾ported by the finding that after sphingosine treatment, 50.5%
of the apoptotic cells retained their rod-shaped appearance
and did not supercontract in the presence of millimolar Ca21.
Apoptosis in neonatal cardiomyocytes. Sphingolipids can
also drive neonatal cardiomyocytes into apoptosis (Figs. 8 and 9).
When cells were cultured for 18 h with 10 mmol/liter C2 cera￾mide, sphingosine-1-phosphate, or sphingosine, the cells showed
extensive DNA fragmentation with discernible z 200-bp oli￾gonucleosomal laddering characteristic of apoptosis (Fig. 8).
Control cells cultured in DMEM/F12 with 10% FCS did not
show any discernible laddering or other features of apoptosis.
In comparison with sphingosine, C2 ceramide was less effec￾tive in producing oligonucleosomal ladders. The lower effec￾tiveness of ceramide in inducing neonatal cells into apoptosis is
in agreement with the comet data of Fig. 3 D, showing that in
adult cells, sphingosine produced a higher yield of apoptotic
type cells than did ceramide. When neonatal cardiomyocytes
were cultured overnight with sphingosine, 72.2612.8% of the
cells exhibited type C apoptotic-type comets (data from five
fields of neonatal cells) compared with 0.0% type C comets ex￾hibited by control (untreated) cells (data from four fields of
neonatal cells). Treatment of neonatal cardiomyocytes with
the sphingosine conversion product, sphingosine-1-phosphate,
showed extensive oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation, sug￾gesting that this metabolite may be physiologically relevant in
the signaling pathway for apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. Curi￾ously, TNFa did not produce detectable apoptosis in neonatal
cardiomyocytes as evidenced by absence of significant ladder￾ing, or by comet and TUNEL analyses (data not shown).
In agreement with the presence of double-stranded DNA
cleavage on agarose gels, neonatal cells displayed TUNEL
staining in response to sphingosine (Fig. 9). Untreated (con￾trol) cardiomyocytes were largely unstained (Fig. 9 A), while
most of the cells treated with sphingosine (Fig. 9 B) were apop￾totic as judged by nick-end labeling of fragmented DNA.
Many of the nick-end–labeled nuclei in Fig. 9 B showed evi￾dence of pyknotic bodies. Ethidium bromide–stained neonatal
cardiomyocytes also more clearly demonstrated that sphin￾gosine produced the characteristic morphological changes that
are hallmarks of apoptosis, including substantial chromatin
fragmentation and the formation of pyknotic nuclei (Fig. 9 C).
These results, taken together, suggest that both developing
(neonatal) and terminally differentiated (adult) cardiomyo￾cytes are susceptible to apoptosis, although possibly to differ￾ent degrees and in response to different triggers.
Discussion
This study provides the first evidence that TNFa and its sphin￾golipid second messenger molecules, including ceramide, sph￾ingosine, and sphingosine-1-phosphate, can induce apoptosis
in cardiomyocytes. Moreover, the resulting cardiomyocyte cell
death is not associated with appreciable necrosis as evidenced
not only by cell viability assays but also by the preponderance
of apoptotic-like nuclei in the single cell gel electrophoresis
(comet) assay and the presence of pyknotic nuclear fragmenta￾tion patterns characteristic of apoptosis.
Apoptosis and programmed cell death are often inappro￾priately equated with necrotic cell death. However, important
distinctions can and must be made, since apoptosis and necro￾sis have different consequences and they present distinct histo￾pathological features in the clinical setting. Some widely used
techniques for assessing apoptosis have been criticized for
their inabilities to distinguish apoptotic cells from the DNA
fragmentation associated with necrosis unless other criteria are
applied (44). Neither nick-end labeling nor flow cytometry can
differentiate the double-strand breaks commonly associated
with apoptotic cell death from the more random breaks char￾acteristic of necrosis. The presence of oligonucleosomal DNA
ladders is often used to identify double-stranded DNA breaks.
However, according to Collins et al. (44), evidence of DNA
laddering is not a definitive hallmark of apoptosis and should
not be used as the sole criterion for apoptosis, since internu￾cleosomal fragmentation can occur as a result of necrosis and
many nuclei must be caught in synchronous fragmentation pat￾terns to get a result. Using a variety of standard techniques and
a newly developed technique for assessing DNA damage in
nuclei, the comet assay, we have demonstrated the induction
of apoptosis in cardiomyocytes.
The observation that TNFa is a trigger for apoptosis in the
heart suggests that the cardiotoxicity of TNFa observed in a
variety of clinical conditions, including heart disease and sep￾sis, are not only due to TNFa’s acute negative inotropic effects
(23), but may also be complicated by TNFa-induced cell death

by apoptosis. The levels of TNFa capable of producing apop￾tosis in our cultured rat cardiomyocytes are within the range
found in serum of patients experiencing severe acute myocar￾dial infarction (16, 45), suggesting that TNFa may contribute
to cell death by apoptosis during ischemia. It has been shown
that apoptosis occurs in experimental models of ischemia/
reperfusion injury (5, 6, 13) and, importantly, that apoptosis is
a feature of human ischemic myocardial damage (7, 8). More￾over, it has recently been shown that apoptosis rather than ne￾crosis determines the size of myocardial infarcts (10). Since
cardiac cells themselves may produce TNFa (21, 22), local
concentrations of the cytokine are expected to be higher than
reported serum values, complicating our ability to estimate the
extent of apoptosis that may be caused by TNFa during acute
ischemia, heart failure, or other conditions in which TNFa
may play a role in cardiac cell death. Since the true concentra￾tion of TNFa in heart tissue is unknown, one cannot know ex￾actly the extent of TNFa-induced apoptosis. Importantly, the
data in Fig. 4 also demonstrate that appreciable apoptosis in
rat cardiomyocytes does not occur unless the concentration of
TNFa is in the nmol/liter range. This is in the range that just
exceeds the Kd
 for TNFa binding to type I TNFa receptors
(z 500 pmol/liter) (25), suggesting that TNFa-induced apopto￾sis is mediated by the TNFa receptors present on rat cardi￾omyocytes (23) and that apoptosis is unlikely to occur in the
heart unless the Kd
 for the receptor is approached. Since nor￾mal human serum TNFa levels (1.2 pg/ml or 70 pmol/liter, ref￾erence 46) are far below this value, our data predict that apop￾tosis in the human heart would not occur in the absence of
pathology and then only if the pathology is severe enough to
raise local TNFa levels to approximate the Kd
 for its receptor
(8.5 pg/ml or 500 pmol/liter).
Significantly, receptor-specific anti–sTNFRI antibodies in￾duced appreciable apoptosis in cardiomyocytes (Table III).
These findings strongly implicate the type I p60 receptor in
mediating TNFa-triggered apoptosis and are similar to obser￾vations made by others in which anti–TNFRI antibodies were
shown to induce apoptosis (47, 48). It is possible that antibody
cross-linking of the trimeric receptor activates the signal trans￾duction cascade and accounts for the ability of anti–TNFRI
antibodies to mimic TNFa action.
Data presented here demonstrate that TNFa activates the
sphingomyelin signal transduction pathway, resulting in the
production of the intracellular signaling molecule, sphingosine.
Since sphingosine is a very effective inducer of apoptosis in
cardiomyocytes, it is possible that TNFa’s ability to trigger
apoptosis may result from TNFa-induced sphingosine produc￾tion, similar to the finding that TNFa-induced sphingosine
production is responsible for apoptosis in HL-60 cells (20). Sig￾nificantly, we have demonstrated that the TNFRI is the pre￾dominant receptor for TNFa in adult rat cardiomyocytes (23).
Since it is well established that the TNFRI is the receptor
linked to membrane-bound sphingomyelinase (26) and to
sphingosine production (49), we speculate that TNFa-induced
apoptosis may be mediated by the TNFRI coupled to the
sphingomyelin signal transduction cascade.
The mechanism of sphingosine-induced apoptosis has not
yet been determined. One possibility is that sphingosine down￾regulates the expression of the cell death repressor, bcl-2, as it
does in other cells (50). Since protein kinase C (PKC) may
protect cells from apoptotic cell death (18, 51, 52) and since
sphingosine is a potent inhibitor of PKC (53), it is also possible

that sphingosine could promote apoptosis through PKC inhibi￾tion, possibly by changing the level of bcl-2 phosphorylation
(51, 52). It is curious that while TNFa triggered apoptosis in
adult cardiomyocytes, apoptosis could not be detected in the
TNFa-treated neonatal cells. In experiments employing re￾verse transcriptase PCR (see Methods), we have determined
that, in contrast with adult rat cardiomyocytes, neonatal cardi￾omyocytes in culture do not possess detectable transcript lev￾els for the TNFRI (data not shown). This relative absence of
receptor in neonatal cells can account for the observed lack of
responsiveness to TNFa.
The surprising ease with which adult cardiomyocytes can
be driven into apoptosis by sphingolipids and TNFa may be
due to the presence of a preexisting death program that can be
readily activated with the appropriate trigger. Apoptosis is of￾ten equated with programmed cell death and as such can also
be distinguished from necrosis in that it is critically dependent
upon the expression of the bcl family of protooncogenes, in￾cluding bcl-2 itself, which normally protects cells from apop￾totic triggers (54, 55). Low bcl-2 expression has been reported
in adult rat and chicken cardiac muscle (10, 56). Thus it is pos￾sible that cardiac muscle is not well protected from apoptotic
triggers. This may explain, in part, why cardiomyocytes are
readily driven into apoptosis by physiologically relevant trig￾gers of the death program, such as TNFa and sphingolipid sec￾ond messengers.
The present study suggests that cardiac cells could be
driven into apoptosis by other triggers, such as infection, in￾jury, or hypoxia. In contrast to necrosis, apoptotic cells do not
trigger a generalized immune response, nor do apoptotic cells
release harmful cytoplasmic contents (e.g., lytic enzymes, po￾tassium) that would have adverse effects on neighboring cells.
Because of this “good neighbor policy,” cardiac apoptosis may
be an effective suicide mechanism that limits the site of injury
by preventing damaged cells from injuring neighboring
healthy cells. By comparison with necrotic cell death, apopto￾sis may thus be beneficial to the heart if it could act to limit the
area of involvement; for example, during myocardial infarc￾tion, cardiac tumor growth, or viral infection of cardiac tissue.
The recent finding that apoptosis and not necrosis determines
the size of myocardial infarcts (10) is consistent with the notion
that apoptosis may define and possibly limit the damaged area.
The ability of heart cells to readily undergo apoptosis may also
help explain the rare incidence of primary cardiac tumors (57).
On the other hand, unregulated or inappropriate apoptosis of
the heart could produce adverse consequences, such as the po￾tential loss of cardiac cells resulting from TNFa-induced apop￾tosis that we predict to occur during severe sepsis. The ability
of TNFa to drive adult cardiac cells into apoptosis may con￾tribute to the cardiotoxic effects of TNFa that have limited its
usefulness as a therapeutic agent in human cancer therapy and
as an antiviral agent (58). The elucidation of cardiac apoptosis
mechanisms will provide useful information that could poten￾tially aid in the understanding and treatment of a wide variety
of cardiac disorders.
