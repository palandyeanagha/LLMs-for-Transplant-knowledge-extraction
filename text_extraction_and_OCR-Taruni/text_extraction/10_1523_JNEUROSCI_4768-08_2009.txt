Respiratory motoneuron response to hypoxia is reflex in nature and carotid body sensory receptor constitutes the afferent limb of this
reflex. Recent studies showed that repetitive exposures to hypoxia evokes long term facilitation of sensory nerve discharge (sLTF) of the
carotid body in rodents exposed to chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH). Although studies with anti-oxidants suggested the involvement
of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated signaling in eliciting sLTF, the source of and the mechanisms associated with ROS generation
have not yet been investigated. We tested the hypothesis that ROS generated by NADPH oxidase (NOX) mediate CIH-evoked sLTF.
Experiments were performed on ex vivo carotid bodies from rats and mice exposed either to 10 d of CIH or normoxia. Acute repetitive
hypoxia evoked a 12-fold increase in NOX activity in CIH but not in control carotid bodies, and this effect was associated with
upregulation of NOX2 mRNA and protein, which was primarily localized to glomus cells of the carotid body. sLTF was prevented by NOX
inhibitors and was absent in mice deficient in NOX2. NOX activation by CIH required 5-HT release and activation of 5-HT2 receptors
coupled to PKC signaling. Studies with ROS scavengers revealed that H2O2 generated from O2
 contributes to sLTF. Priming with H2O2
elicited sLTF of carotid bodies from normoxic control rats and mice, similar to that seen in CIH-treated animals. These observations
reveal a novel role for NOX-induced ROS signaling in mediating sensory plasticity of the carotid body.
Introduction
Repetitive exposures to hypoxia result in long-lasting activation
of respiratory motor output known as long-term facilitation
(LTF) of breathing (for review, see Powell et al., 1998). LTF is
regarded as a form of plasticity of respiratory motoneuron activ￾ity that is uniquely expressed in response to repetitive but not by
continuous hypoxia (Baker et al., 2001). Respiratory motoneu￾ron response to hypoxia is reflex in nature and carotid body
sensory receptor constitutes the afferent limb of this reflex. Re￾cent studies from our laboratory showed that repetitive hypoxia
also induces LTF of the carotid body afferent nerve activity [sen￾sory LTF (sLTF)] (Peng et al., 2003, 2006b). However, unlike LTF
of the respiratory motor activity, sLTF of the carotid body re￾quires prior conditioning with chronic intermittent hypoxia
(CIH). The CIH-induced sLTF was reversible after reexposure to
normoxia and could be prevented by treating CIH rats with anti￾oxidants (Peng et al., 2003), indicating the involvement of reac￾tive oxygen species (ROS). However, neither the source nor the
mechanism(s) by which ROS are generated in CIH-treated ca￾rotid bodies has been examined.
The family of NADPH oxidase (NOX) enzymes constitutes
one of the major sources of ROS generation. NOX2 (also called
gp91 phox) is the most extensively studied member of the NOX
family. Recent studies have shown that ROS generated by NOX2
mediate long-term potentiation (LTP) of neuronal activity, hip￾pocampal synaptic plasticity, and memory (Kishida et al. 2006;
Kishida and Klann, 2007). Zhan et al. (2005) reported that NOX2
mediates CIH-induced changes in sleep behavior. NOX2 is ex￾pressed in glomus cells (the putative hypoxic sensing cells) of the
carotid body (Youngson et al. 1997; Dinger et al., 2007) and
contributes to the induction of LTP elsewhere in the nervous
system (Kishida et al. 2006); these findings prompted us to hy￾pothesize that NOX2 and/or closely related NOX isoform medi￾ate sLTF of the carotid body. Here, we demonstrate that CIH
leads to regulated NOX2 activation that requires 5-HT/5-HT2
receptors/protein kinase C (PKC) signaling and the resulting
ROS, especially H2O2 is critical for evoking sLTF. These observa￾tions unravel a novel role for NOX2 and ROS in inducing sensory
plasticity of the carotid body.
Materials and Methods
Experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of the University of Chicago and were performed on adult
male rats (Sprague Dawley, 200 –300 gm), wild type (WT, C57BL/6),
hemizygous gp91phox/Y (from Jackson Laboratories; weights 20 –25
gm), and Pet-1 / mice (from Dr. Deneris, weights 20 –25 gm).
Exposure to chronic intermittent hypoxia. Unrestrained, freely moving
animals housed in feeding cages were exposed to chronic intermittent
hypoxia (CIH; for 10 d; 8 h  day 1
) as previously described (Peng and
Prabhakar, 2004). Briefly, animals were placed in a specialized chamber,
which was flushed with alternating cycles of pure nitrogen and com￾pressed air. During hypoxia, inspired O2 levels reached 5% O2 (nadir).

The gas flows were regulated by timer￾controlled solenoid valves. Ambient O2 and
CO2 levels in the chamber were continuously
monitored by an O2/CO2 analyzer (Alpha
Omega Instrument; Series 9500). Control ex￾periments were performed on animals exposed
to alternating cycles of compressed room air
instead of hypoxia in the same chamber. Acute
experiments were performed on rats or mice
anesthetized with intraperitoneal injections of
urethane (1.2 g  kg 1
, Sigma) 16 h after ter￾minating CIH.
Measurements of carotid body sensory activity.
Sensory activity from carotid bodiesex vivo was
recorded as described previously (Peng and
Prabhakar 2004, Peng et al. 2006b). Briefly, ca￾rotid bodies along with the sinus nerves were
harvested from anesthetized animals. After
cleaning the connective tissue, the carotid body
along with the sinus nerve was placed in a re￾cording chamber (volume 250 l) and super￾fused at a rate of 2 ml  min 1 with warm phys￾iological saline (36°C) containing the following
(mM): NaCl (125), KCl (5), CaCl2 (1.8), MgSO4
(2), NaH2PO4 (1.2), NaHCO3 (25), D-Glucose
(10), Sucrose (5), bubbled with 95% O2/5%
CO2, pH 7.4. To facilitate recording of clearly
identifiable action potentials, the sinus nerve
was treated with 0.1% collagenase for 5 min.
Action potentials (2– 4 active units) were re￾corded from one of the nerve bundles with a
suction electrode, amplified (AC-preamplifier,
Grass Instrument, P511K; bandwidth of 100 –
3000 Hz), displayed on an oscilloscope (Tektro￾nix 5B12N), and stored in a computer via an
A/D translation board (PowerLab/8P, AD In￾struments). “Single” units were selected based
on the height and duration of the individual
action potentials using a spike discrimination
program (Spike Histogram Program, Power
Lab, AD Instruments). In each carotid body, at
least 2 chemoreceptor units were analyzed.
Induction of sLTF of the carotid body. The
protocols for evoking sLTF of rat carotid body
ex vivo were the same as described previously (Peng et al. 2003). Briefly,
baseline sensory activity was recorded for 15 min with perfusate
(pO2140 mmHg) containing either vehicle or the drugs followed by
10 episodes of repetitive hypoxia (pO242 mmHg for 30 s), separated
by 5 min of normoxia (pO2140 mmHg). Sensory activity was mon￾itored continuously for 60 min after terminating repetitive hypoxia. The
protocols evoking sLTF in mice carotid body ex vivowere the same except
that 5 episodes of repetitive hypoxia were used.
Measurements of NADPH oxidase activity. NADPH oxidase activity
was determined by monitoring O2
 dependent reduction of ferric cyto￾chrome C at 550 nm as described previously (Mayo and Curnutte, 1990).
Briefly, freshly harvested carotid bodies were placed in PBS, 0.9 mM
CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2 and 7.5 mM glucose, pH 7.4. The reaction was
initiated by addition of cytochrome C (75 M) to the reaction medium.
Increase in the absorbance was monitored at 550 nm for 5 min. The
amount of reduced cytochrome C formed during the reaction was deter￾mined using the molar extinction coefficient of 21.7moles  cm 2
. The
enzyme activity was expressed as picomoles min 1 per carotid body.
NOX mRNA expression in the carotid body by quantitative real-time
PCR. Real-time RT-PCR was performed using a MiniOpticon system
(Bio-Rad Laboratories) with SYBR GreenER two-step qRT-PCR kit
(#11764 –100, Invitrogen). Briefly, RNA was extracted from rat carotid
bodies using TRIZOL and was reverse transcribed using superscript III
reverse transcriptase. Primer sequences for real time RT-PCR amplifica￾tion were as follows: 18 s: [forward (fw)] GTAACCCGTTGAAC￾CCCATT and [reverse (rev)] CCATCCAATCGGTAGTAGCG (Size 151,
Gene Bank # X_01117); NOX1: (fw) CACTGTGGCTTTGGTTCTA and
(rev) TGAGGACTCCTGCAACTCCT (Size 240, Gene Bank #
NM_053683); NOX2: (fw) GTGGAGTGGTGTGAATGC and (rev) TT￾TGGTGGAGGATGTGATGA (Size 219, Gene Bank # NM_023965);
NOX3: (fw) GACCCAACTGGAATGAGGAA and (rev) AATGAAC￾GACCCTAGGATCT (Size 150, Gene Bank # NM_001004216); and
NOX4: (fw) CGGGGTGGCTTGTTGAAGTAT and (rev) CGGGGTG￾GCTTGTTGAAGTAT (Size 205, Gene Bank # NM_053524). Relative
mRNA quantification was calculated using the comparative threshold
(CT) method using the formula “2 CT” where CT is the difference
between the threshold cycle of the given target cDNA between nomoxia
and CIH. The CT value was taken as a fractional cycle number at which
the emitted fluorescence of the sample passes a fixed threshold above the
baseline. Values were compared with an internal standard gene 18S.
Purity and specificity of all products were confirmed by omitting the
template and by performing a standard melting curve analysis.
Immunohistochemistry. Anesthetized rats or mice were perfused intra￾cardially with heparinized phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) at a
rate of 10 ml min 1 for 10 min followed by buffered Formalde (10%
Formalin; Fischer Scientific). Carotid artery bifurcations were removed
and placed in 4% paraformaldehyde–PBS for 1 h at 4°C, washed in PBS,
and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose–PBS at 4°C for 24 h. Specimens were
frozen in Tissue Tek (OCT; VWR Scientific) and serially sectioned at 8
m. For NOX2 and NOX4 localization, rat carotid body sections were
incubated at 37°C for 2 h with either anti-NOX2 antibody (Santa Cruz, #

dilution) followed by FITC and Alexa Fluor 555 conjugated secondary
antibodies (Invitrogen). For identification of glomus cells, sections were
doubled stained with polyclonal anti-chromogranin-A (CGA) antibody
(Abcam, # ab45138; 1:100) or monoclonal anti-tyrosine hydroxylase
(TH) antibody (Sigma; 1:4000), established markers of glomus cells. In
mice, 5-HT immunolocalization in the carotid body was performed with
monoclonal anti-5-HT antibody (Millipore;
1:100). Sections were mounted in DAPI￾containing media and visualized using a Nikon
fluorescent microscope.
Immunoblot assays. Immunoblot assays were
performed as described previously (Yuan et al.
2008). Briefly, carotid bodies were homoge￾nized in RIPA buffer (1PBS, 1% Nonidet
P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1
mM sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mM PMSF, 5 g
ml –1 leupeptin, 5 g ml –1 aproteinin, and 10
l  ml1 protease inhibitor cocktail). Cell lysates
were fractionated by 7.5% polyacrylamide-SDS
gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvi￾nylpyrrolidone difluoride membrane
(Immobilon-P, Millipore). The membrane was
blocked with Tris-buffered saline (TBS-T) con￾taining 5% nonfat milk at 4°C overnight. Mem￾branes were incubated with anti-gp91 phox anti￾body (Santa Cruz; 1:200) or anti-NOX4 antibody
(from Dr. Lambeth; 1;500) or anti-phospho￾MARCKS antibody (Protein Tech Group; 1:1000
dilution) or anti--tubulin antibody (Sigma;
1:1000) in TBS-T containing 3% nonfat milk.
Membranes were treated with donkey anti-goat
secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish
peroxidase (Santa Cruz; 1:2000) in TBS-T con￾taining 3% nonfat milk. Immune complexes on
the membrane were visualized using a chemilu￾minescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham).
The membranes were exposed to Kodak XAR
films.
Measurement of 5-hydroxytryptamine release.
5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) release from ca￾rotid bodies was analyzed by high performance
liquid chromatography coupled to an electro￾chemical detection system (HPLC-ECD) as de￾scribed previously (Jacono et al., 2005). Briefly,
freshly isolated carotid bodies were incubated
with 200 l of Ca 2/Mg 2 free Krebs–Ringer
bicarbonate (KRB) medium preequilibrated
with 95% O2  5% CO2 for 90 min at 4°C.
Subsequently, incubation medium was
switched to 50 l of KRB with Ca 2/Mg 2
equilibrated with appropriate gas mixtures re￾sulting in medium PO2s of either 146  7
mmHg (normoxia) or 43  8 mmHg (hyp￾oxia). Each gas challenge was given for 5 min.
5-HT in the medium was analyzed by HPLC￾ECD and expressed as femtomoles of
5-HT  min 1  carotid body 1

Experimental protocols. Series 1: In these ex￾periments, the effects of CIH on NOX enzyme
activity, mRNAs encoding various NOX iso￾forms and NOX protein expressions were ana￾lyzed in the rat carotid bodies. Control experi￾ments were performed on rats reared under
normoxia (n  6 each; 6 carotid bodies/exper￾iment). For measurements of NOX enzyme ac￾tivity, carotid bodies were challenged with 10
episodes of repetitive hypoxia (pO242
mmHg for 30 s. followed by 5 min. of normoxia
pO2140 mmHg). Ten minutes after termi￾nating the 10th episode of hypoxia, the carotid bodies were collected and
the NOX activity was determined as described above. Series 2: The effects
of NOX inhibitors, apocynin, diphenyl iodinium (DPI), 4-(2-

CIH (WT and gp91phox/Y, n  7 each). Series 4:
Carotid bodies were harvested from CIH- and
normoxia-exposed rats and the effects of acute
hypoxia on 5-HT release were examined (con￾trol and CIH; n  3 each and 6 carotid bodies

exposed either to normoxia or CIH (n  7 each
for WT and Pet-1 / mice). Series 6: The ef￾fects of ketanserin, a 5-HT-2 receptor antago￾nist or bisindolylmaleimide-1 (Bis-1), a PKC

normoxia- and CIH-exposed rats. Series 7: The
effects of MnTMPyP (n  6), a membrane per￾meable scavenger of O2
, or PEG-catalase
(n  6), a scavenger of H2O2, on sLTF were
examined. Series 8: The effects of exogenous ad￾ministration of H2O2 on sLTF were examined
in rats reared under normoxia with (n  7) and
without (n  6) H2O2. In 5 additional rat ca￾rotid bodies, sensory activity was recorded for
90 min while superfusing carotid bodies with
500 nM H2O2. Parallel experiments were per￾formed examining the effects of exogenous ad￾ministration of H2O2 on carotid body sLTF in
WT, gp91phox/Y and Pet-1/ mice (n  6 –7 each). Based on prelimi￾nary studies 200 nM H2O2 was chosen in the experiments involving mice
carotid bodies.
Drugs and antibodies. The following drugs or chemicals were used:
4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (AEBFS),
2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate (2-APB), apocynin (Acetovanillone),
cadmium chloride, diphenyl iodinium (DPI), hydrogen peroxide, ketan￾serin tartrate, PEG-catalase, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)
from Sigma; bisindolymadeimide I (Bis-1, Calbiochem); manganese
(III) tetrakis (1-methyl-4-pyridyl) porphyrin pentachloride (MnT￾MPyP, Alexis Chemicals). Stock solutions were made fresh and desired
concentrations of the drugs were added to the medium in the reservoirs
before the experiment.
Data analysis. Chemoreceptor activity of “single units” (impulses  s
1
)
was averaged every 15 min under baseline conditions, every 30 s during
and every 5 min following acute hypoxia challenge for 60 min. Changes
in chemoreceptor activity were expressed as percentage of baseline val￾ues. The data are expressed as mean  SEM. Statistical significance was
assessed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. p values
0.05 were considered significant.
Results
Effects of CIH on NOX expression and enzyme activity in the
carotid body
Basal NOX activity was comparable between CIH- and
normoxia-treated carotid bodies. Acute repetitive hypoxia re￾sulted in 12-fold increase in NOX activity in CIH but not in
control carotid bodies ( p  0.01) (Fig. 1A), and apocyanin (500
M), an inhibitor of NOX, prevented this response. Unlike repet￾itive exposures, a single episode of hypoxia was ineffective in
activating NOX ( p 	 0.05).
Several NOX isoforms have been identified [see Bedard and
Krause (2007) for references]. To determine which of the NOX
isoforms are expressed in the rat carotid body, and whether they
are affected by CIH, NOX1, 2, 3, and 4 mRNA expressions were
examined by quantitative real time PCR in control and CIH￾treated carotid bodies. NOX1, 2, 3, and 4 mRNAs could readily be
detected in the control carotid body (Fig. 1B). In CIH-treated
carotid bodies, NOX 1, 2 and 4 mRNAs were upregulated;
whereas NOX3 mRNA expression was unaffected. The magni￾tude of increase in NOX2 mRNA was more pronounced (35-
fold) than NOX 1 (16-fold) and NOX4 (13-fold). Because
NOX1 is a homolog of NOX2 (Suh et al. 1999; Ba´nfi et al. 2000),
we chose to examine the localization of NOX2 and NOX4 pro￾teins by immunohistochemistry in control and CIH-treated
carotid bodies. Immunoreactive product of NOX2 was local￾ized to the cytoplasm of glomus cells; whereas that of NOX4
was localized to the nucleus of glomus as well as other cells in
control and CIH-treated carotid bodies (Fig. 1C,D). Western
blot assay revealed a 2.0 –2.5-fold increase in NOX2 and
NOX 4 proteins in CIH compared with control carotid bodies
( p  0.01).
NOX is required for CIH-induced sLTF of the carotid body
The effects of three structurally distinct inhibitors of NOX, i.e.,
apocynin, DPI and AEBFS on sLTF were examined to assess the
potential contribution of NOX activation to sLTF. As shown Fig￾ure 2A,B, repetitive hypoxia evoked robust sLTF in CIH-exposed
carotid bodies and apocynin prevented this effect. However,
hypoxia-evoked sensory excitation (impulses  s 1
) was un￾affected by apocynin (CIHvehicle control  10.8  2.1 vs
CIH  apocynin  8.7  1.7; p 	 0.05). Like apocyanin, 3
M DPI and 500 M AEBFS also prevented the induction of
sLTF (Fig. 2C).
Although the above described effects of pharmacological in￾hibitors suggest a role for NOX in evoking sLTF, they cannot
differentiate the contribution of different NOX isoforms. To as￾sess the selective contribution of NOX2, sLTF was monitored in
CIH-exposed mice deficient in gp91 phox i.e., NOX2 and age
matched wild type (WT) controls. As shown in Figure 3, sLTF
could be evoked in CIH-treated WT but not in gp91 phox/Y mice.
However, hypoxia-evoked sensory excitation could be elicited in
both groups of mice (Fig. 3A) (p 	 0.05).

CIH-evoked NOX activation and sLTF require 5-HT and
5-HT2 receptors
The following experiments were performed to address the mech￾anism(s) underlying NOX activation in CIH-treated carotid bod￾ies. Exogenous applications of 5-HT has
been shown to activate NOX in the carotid
body via 5-HT2 receptors coupled to pro￾tein kinase C (PKC) activation (Peng et al.
2006a). To examine the role of 5-HT in
NOX activation, we first determined
whether hypoxia releases 5-HT from ca￾rotid bodies. As shown in Figure 4, hyp￾oxia (43  8 mmHg) resulted in robust
5-HT release from CIH-treated carotid
bodies (basal release during normoxia 
1.6  0.08 vs hypoxia  8.1  0.1 femto￾moles per min per carotid body); whereas
it had no effect on 5-HT release from
normoxia-treated carotid body (Fig. 4B).
The hypoxia-evoked 5-HT release from
CIH-treated carotid body was completely
prevented by 75 M 2-APB, a purported
ionositol phosphate-3 (IP3) receptor/
TRPM2 channel blocker (Pinilla et al.
2005). In contrast, CdCl2 (300 M), a
broad-spectrum voltage-gated Ca 2
channel blocker had no significant effect
(Fig. 4B).
If 5-HT is the upstream signaling mol￾ecule for CIH-evoked NOX activation,
then the ensuing sLTF should be absent in
carotid bodies with impaired 5-HT ex￾pression. Mice deficient in the gene encod￾ing the Pet-1 transcription factor exhibit
markedly reduced 5-HT expression in the
CNS (Hendricks et al. 1999, 2003) and
Pet-1 / mice offer elegant model for ex￾ploring the role of 5-HT in CIH-evoked
sLTF.We first examined whether 5-HT ex￾pression is reduced in the carotid bodies of
Pet-1/ mice.As shownin Figure 5A,many
glomus cells expressed 5-HT-like immuno￾reactivity in WT but not in Pet-1/ mice.
Functional analysis of carotid body activity
showed that sLTF was absent in both control
WT and Pet-1/ mice reared under nor￾moxia. However,following CIH, sLTF could
readily be elicited only in WT but not in
Pet-1/ mice (Fig. 5B,C).
To assess whether NOX activation and
sLTF require activation of 5-HT2 receptors
and PKC, carotid bodies harvested from
CIH- and normoxia-treated rats were
challenged with 10 episodes of repetitive
hypoxia and levels of phosphorylated
MARCKS (myristoylated alanine-rich C
kinase substrate) were monitored as an in￾dex of PKC activation (Wen et al. 2006).
Repetitive hypoxia increased p-MARCKS
levels by 3-fold in CIH-treated but not in
control carotid bodies (Fig. 6A). Either
blockade of 5-HT2 receptors by ketanserin
or inhibition of PKC-isoforms with Bis-1
prevented repetitive hypoxia elicited increases in p-MARCKS
levels as well as NOX activation in CIH-treated carotid bodies
(Fig. 6A,B). More importantly, both ketanserin and Bis-1 also
prevented sLTF (Fig. 7). Ketanserin, however, had no effect on

dopamine (100 M) evoked sensory inhi￾bition of the carotid body (data not
shown), suggesting that at 1 M concen￾tration, it selectively affected 5-HT
receptors.
ROS generated by NOX mediates IH￾induced sLTF of the carotid body
NOX activation leads to generation of
ROS, especially O2
. To determine
whether O2
 generated by NOX contrib￾utes to sLTF, the effect of MnTMPyP, a
membrane permeable scavenger of O2

was examined. When CIH-treated ca￾rotid bodies were continuously chal￾lenged with 50 M MnTMPyP, repetitive
hypoxia did not elicit sLTF (CIH Ve￾hicle sLTF  160  11% vs
CIHMnTMPyP18  8%; p  0.01;
n  6 each). However, when applied 15
min after the onset of sLTF, MnTMPyP
did not inhibit sLTF (Fig. 8A,C). To test
whether H2O2, a dismutated product of
O2
 contributes to sLTF, carotid bodies
were challenged with 200U/ml PEG￾catalase, a membrane permeable scaven￾ger of H2O2 15 min after the onset of
sLTF. As shown in Figure 8, B and C,
PEG-catalase completely prevented
sLTF.
We examined whether priming the ca￾rotid body with exogenous H2O2 can
mimic the effects of CIH in control
normoxia-treated carotid bodies. As
shown in Figure 9A, in presence of as little
as 500 nM H2O2, repetitive hypoxia evoked
robust sLTF in normoxia-treated carotid
bodies, similar to that seen with CIH treat￾ment. Control experiments revealed that
in the absence of H2O2, repetitive hypoxia
was ineffective in evoking sLTF, and super￾fusion with 500 nM H2O2 alone for 90 min
had no effect on the baseline sensory activ￾ity (Fig. 9A). Like wise, in presence of 200
nM H2O2, repetitive hypoxia also evoked
sLTF in carotid bodies from control WT
and gp91 phox/Y as well as Pet-1 / mice
reared under normoxia (Fig. 9B).
Discussion
In the present study, we examined the role
of NOX in CIH-evoked sensory plasticity
of the carotid body manifested as sLTF.
The following lines of evidence demon￾strate that NOX is essential for evoking
sLTF. First, mRNAs encoding NOX1, 2, 3
and 4 isoforms were expressed, and CIH
upregulated NOX1, 2 and 4 mRNAs as
well as corresponding NOX2 and 4 proteins in rat carotid bodies.
Second, NOX activity increased in response to repetitive hypoxia
in CIH but not in control carotid bodies. Third, three structurally
and functionally distinct inhibitors of NOX (i.e., apocynin, DPI,
AEBFS) prevented sLTF.
Although CIH upregulated three NOX isoforms, sLTF was
absent in gp91 phox knock-out mice, suggesting a major role for
NOX2 in mediating sensory plasticity of the carotid body, which
was further supported by the observation that it is primarily lo￾calized to the cytoplasm of glomus cells, the putative hypoxia

sensing cells. In contrast, NOX4 expression was ubiquitous and
was confined to the nucleus rather than the cytoplasm. Nuclear
localization of NOX4 was also recently reported in cells of pul￾monary origin (Pendyala et al. 2009). NOX 4, because of its nu￾clear localization, might play a role in CIH-evoked transcrip￾tional activation (Yuan et al. 2008), rather than evoking sLTF, a
possibility that requires further investiga￾tion. Since NOX1 is a homolog of NOX2
(Suh et al. 1999; Ba´nfi et al. 2000), it might
also contribute to sLTF similar to NOX2.
It has been proposed that NOX2 functions
as an O2 sensor in the carotid body (see
Dinger et al., 2007 for references). How￾ever, consistent with a previous report (He
et al. 2002), we also found that carotid
body sensory response to acute hypoxia
was preserved in NOX-2 knock-out mice.
These findings taken together suggest a
novel role for NOX2 in inducing sensory
plasticity of the carotid body under the
conditions such as CIH, rather than func￾tioning as an O2 sensor.
Despite the upregulation of NOX2 pro￾tein by CIH, basal NOX activity was nearly
the same as in controls; whereas it could be
activated only after acute repetitive hyp￾oxia, suggesting that CIH leads to a regu￾lated rather than constitutive activation of
NOX. The following observations demon￾strate that 5-HT2 receptors coupled to
PKC activation contribute to the regulated
NOX activation. First, 5-HT2 receptor an￾tagonist as well as PKC inhibitor pre￾vented NOX activation in CIH-treated ca￾rotid bodies. Second, repetitive hypoxia
led to PKC activation in CIH but not in control carotid bodies
and a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist prevented this effect. Activation
of 5-HT2 receptors require release of 5-HT. Indeed, hypoxia
evoked robust 5-HT release from CIH but not from control ca￾rotid bodies. More importantly, sLTF, which is the consequence
of NOX activation by 5-HT2 receptors, was completely absent in
Pet-1 / mice with impaired 5-HT expression in the carotid
body. A recent study reported that exogenous 5-HT is a potent
inducer of sLTF in control rat carotid bodies, and the effects of
5-HT are mediated via NOX activation by 5-HT2 receptors and
PKC (Peng et al. 2006a). These findings taken together with the
observations of the present study suggest that 5-HT via 5-HT2 recep￾tor activation mediates regulated NOX2 activation and the ensuing
sLTF in CIH-treated carotid bodies.
It is intriguing that hypoxia released 5-HT from CIH but not
from control carotid bodies. Considerable evidence suggests that
activation of voltage-gated Ca 2 channels and subsequent eleva￾tions in [Ca 2]i in glomus cells are critical for hypoxia-evoked
transmitter release from the carotid body [see Prabhakar (2000)
for references]. However, CdCl2, a broad spectrum voltage-gated
Ca 2 channel blocker had no effect; whereas 2-APB, a purported
blocker of IP-3 receptors and/or TRPM2 channels completely
prevented hypoxia-evoked 5-HT release from CIH-treated ca￾rotid bodies. These findings indicate that CIH recruits additional
Ca 2 signaling pathways such as mobilization of intracellular
Ca 2 for evoking 5-HT release by hypoxia. The absence of NOX
activation and sLTF in carotid bodies reared under normoxia is
conceivably be due to the inability of hypoxia to release 5-HT,
which is necessary for NOX activation.
The finding that O2
 generated by NOX mediates LTP in the
CNS (Kishida and Klann, 2007) prompted us to investigate
whether it also contributes to sLTF in the carotid body. The ob￾servations that MnTMPyP, a scavenger of O2
 was effective only
when given before the onset, whereas PEG-catalase, a scavenger

of H2O2 prevented sLTF although given after its onset suggest
that H2O2 generated from O2
 contributes to sLTF. Further￾more, priming the carotid bodies from control normoxic rats
with nanomolar concentrations of exogenous H2O2 mimicked
the effects of CIH by evoking sLTF. Although CIH was ineffective
in eliciting sLTF in gp91 phox/Y and Pet-1 / mice, priming with
exogenous H2O2 elicited sLTF by repetitive hypoxia in both
groups of mice indicating that H2O2 is downstream to 5-HT
dependent NOX2 activation. The signaling cascade leading to
CIH-induced NOX activation and the ensuing sLTF identified in
this study is summarized in Figure 10.
What might be the functional significance of CIH-induced
sLTF of the carotid body? Sleep disordered breathing is charac￾terized by transient repetitive cessations of breathing (apneas)
and leads to periodic decreases in arterial pO2 or CIH. Individuals
affected by recurrent apneas have increased risk for developing
several cardio-respiratory comorbidities including increased
sympathetic tone and respiratory abnormalities (Shahar et al.
2001). The augmented carotid body afferent activity triggers re￾flex activation of sympathetic nervous system and breathing.
Therefore, it is conceivable that CIH-evoked sLTF of the carotid
body via ROS generated by 5-HT-NOX2 signaling contributes to
the autonomic morbidities associated with recurrent apneas.
