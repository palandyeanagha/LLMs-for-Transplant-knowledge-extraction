Abstract
Background: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is common in immunocompetent patients in intensive care units
(ICUs). However, whether CMV infection or CMV reactivation contributes to mortality of immunocompetent patients
remains unclear.
Methods: A literature search was conducted for relevant studies published before May 30, 2016. Studies reporting
on CMV infection in immunocompetent patients in ICUs and containing 2 × 2 tables on CMV results and all-cause
mortality were included.
Results: Eighteen studies involving 2398 immunocompetent patients admitted to ICUs were included in the meta￾analysis. The overall rate of CMV infection was 27% (95%CI 22–34%, I2 = 89%, n = 2398) and the CMV reactivation
was 31% (95%CI 24–39%, I2 = 74%, n = 666). The odds ratio (OR) for all-cause mortality among patients with CMV
infection, compared with those without infection, was 2.16 (95%CI 1.70–2.74, I2 = 10%, n = 2239). Moreover, upon
exclusion of studies in which antiviral treatment was possibly or definitely provided to some patients, the
association of mortality rate with CMV infection was also statistically significant (OR: 1.69, 95%CI 1.01–2.83, I2 = 37%,
n = 912,). For CMV seropositive patients, the OR for mortality in patients with CMV reactivation as compared with
patients without CMV reactivation was 1.72 (95%CI 1.04–2.85, I2 = 29%, n = 664). Patients with CMV infection
required significantly longer mechanical ventilation (mean difference (MD): 9 days (95% CI 5–14, I2 = 81%, n = 875))
and longer duration of ICU stay (MD: 12 days (95% CI 7–17, I2 = 70%, n = 949)) than patients without CMV infection.
When analysis was limited to detection in blood, CMV infection without antiviral drug treatment or reactivation was
not significantly associated with higher mortality (OR: 1.69, 95%CI 0.81–3.54, I2 = 52%, n = 722; OR: 1.49, I2 = 63%,
n = 469).
Conclusion: Critically ill patients without immunosuppression admitted to ICUs show a high rate of CMV infection.
CMV infection during the natural unaltered course or reactivation in critically ill patients is associated with increased
mortality, but have no effect on mortality when CMV in blood. More studies are needed to clarify the impact of
CMV infection on clinical outcomes in those patients.

Background
Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a prototypic member
of the β herpes virus subfamily [1]. The prevalence of
CMV seropositivity in human populations is roughly
50–95% [2–4] and highest amongst older people [5].
Cytomegalovirus infection induces innate immune re￾sponses (eg. natural killer cells) and adaptive immunity
(eg. CD4+/CD8+ T cells). However, the virus can evade
host detection by expressing genes that interfere with
both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Eventu￾ally, CMV is able to establish latency in which either the
host fails to eliminate the virus or the virus cannot repli￾cate. However, CMV can become reactivated during pe￾riods of host immune suppression [6].
It is well known that CMV infection is common in ca￾nonical immunodeficiency patients, such as those with
human immunodeficiency virus infection, solid organ or
stem cell transplantation and patients undergoing chemo￾or radiotherapy [7–9]. With the development of more sen￾sitive detection method, the rate of CMV detection is high
in intensive care units (ICUs) [10–25]. However, so far,
there is no convincing research to support the use of anti￾viral treatment when critically ill but immunocompetent
patients present with CMV infection. Furthermore,
whether CMV is a contributor or simply a bystander to
the severity of illness remains under debate [26–28].
Whether CMV infection is associated with increased
mortality in immunocompetent ICU patients remains
controversial [13–16]. A previous meta-analysis pub￾lished in 2009 demonstrated that CMV infection was as￾sociated with a higher mortality rate, nearly twice that
observed in patients without CMV infection [29]. How￾ever, this study did not consider the influence of antiviral
drugs on clinical outcomes. Moreover, many clinical
studies about CMV have been reported in recent years.
Thus, to acquire a better understanding of the potential
role of CMV infection in contributing to mortality in
critically ill patients, especially those not receiving anti￾viral agents and CMV detected in blood, we performed a
meta-analysis of data available in the literature, focusing
on the outcome in immunocompetent ICU patients with
CMV infection.
Methods
Search strategy
A literature search for relevant publications included within
the electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE and the
Cochrane Library was performed using combinations of
the keywords “cytomegaloviruses”, “salivary gland viruses”,
“herpes virus”, “cytomegaloviral infection”, “HHV5”, “inten￾sive care”, “critical care”, “critical illness”, “mechanical venti￾lation”, and “pulmonary ventilator”. All searches were
updated on May 30, 2016. No language restriction was
enforced. We also consulted relevant reference articles and
searched using Google Scholar.
Study selection
Two researchers (LX and HYB) performed data extraction
independently, and any discrepancies were addressed by
discussion and reevaluation until consensus was achieved.
Observational studies were eligible if they reported on
CMV infection in immunocompetent patients in the ICU,
and if a 2 × 2 table could be constructed based on CMV
results and all-cause mortality. All patients were over
18 years of age. The systematic review included only stud￾ies in which all patients were tested for CMV. An episode
of CMV infection was defined by one of the examination
CMV viral culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR),
CMV antigen (pp65) in blood, tracheal aspirates, urine, or
a combination of these. A case was defined by the pres￾ence of reactivation, where the patient had CMV infection
and was seropositive. Immunocompetent patients were
defined as those patients who did not receive a solid organ
or hematopoietic stem cell transplant, did not receive im￾munosuppressive treatment, did not have human im￾munodeficiency virus infection, did not have primary
immunodeficiency, and did not receive chemotherapy or
radiotherapy before ICU admission.
Data extraction and quality appraisal
We obtained information on basic study characteristics
(author, year of publication, country of origin, study
period, setting, and study design), characteristic popula￾tion, the site and detection method of sample, CMV
seropositivity, CMV infection incidence, all-cause mor￾tality, length of ICU/hospital stay, length of mechanical
ventilation, and administration of antiviral drugs.
The Newcastle–Ottawa scale, developed for evaluating
the quality of observational studies (Additional file 1: Table
S1) [30], was used to assess the validity of included studies.
Data analysis
Continuous variables are reported as mean or median
values and categorical variables are reported as n (%).
Meta-analytic pooling was performed for outcome variables
with a Logit transformation approach, reporting results as
summary point estimates (95% confidence interval, CI). We
used the Mantel–Haenszel method to obtain odds ratios
(ORs) and 95% CI. When only the median, range, or inter￾quartile range of length of mechanical ventilation and the
length of ICU stay were reported, we used simple formulas
to estimate the mean and standard deviation [31].
Between-study heterogeneity was examined using the
I
2 measure of inconsistency and the chi-square test of
heterogeneity.
To evaluate publication bias, we constructed a funnel
plot and used the Egger test. Sensitivity analyses of the

Begg’s test were additionally conducted to ascertain the
robustness of our findings. All meta-analyses were per￾formed with R software (version 3.3.3 for Windows) and
SPSS 18 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).
Results
Study selection
The initial database search identified 1846 potentially
relevant studies. Following this, assessment of the full
text yielded 17 studies suitable for analysis. Another
publication was incorporated after examining refer￾ences from the extracted articles [23]. Consequently,
our meta-analysis consisted of 18 articles (Fig. 1), in￾cluding one case-control [20] and 17 cohort studies
[10–19, 21–25, 32].
Characteristics of included studies
Most studies were conducted in the United States
and Europe, except one cohort study in Egypt [12],
and were published between 1990 and 2016 (Table 1).
Overall, the studies were well done, with a median
score of 7 (range 6–8) on the Newcastle–Ottawa scale
for appraising the quality of observational studies.
A total of 2398 patients were included, having been
admitted to the ICU for a variety of reasons, with a me￾dian age of 59 years. The median period of prospective
studies was 24 months, ranging broadly from 3 to
78 months. All studies used CMV blood assays, and 6
studies also assayed sputum samples. Most studies indi￾cated that the frequency of sample collection was once a
week. In our analysis, the methods used to assess CMV
infection were virus culture, pp65 antigen detection and
PCR detection of CMV DNA in ten, three and two stud￾ies, respectively, and combinations of two diagnostic
methods in the remaining three studies.
CMV infection and outcome in immunocompetent
patients
As shown in Fig. 2, the overall detection rate of CMV was
27% (95% CI 22–34%, I2 = 89%, n = 2398). As compared
with patients without CMV infection, the all-cause mortal￾ity of patients with CMV infection was significantly higher
(OR: 2.16; 95% CI 1.70–2.74, I2 = 10%, n = 2239) (Fig. 3a).
When analysis was limited to CMV detection in blood,
there was still statistical significance in mortality rate be￾tween patients with CMV infection (OR: 2.15, 95% CI
1.48–3.15, I2 = 34%, n = 1441) compared with patients with￾out infection (Additional file 2: Figure S1).
To rule out the impact of antiviral drugs on patients with
CMV infection, four studies in which patients received anti￾viral drugs during their ICU stay and eight studies that did
not specify the use of antiviral drugs were excluded. The

remaining six studies of patients without antiviral treatment
during the course of ICU stay were analyzed [10, 13, 18, 19,
21, 33]. The difference in mortality rates between patients
with CMV infection remained significant (OR: 1.69, 95% CI
1.01–2.83, I2 = 37%, n = 912) compared with patients with￾out infection (Fig. 3b). When analysis was limited to CMV
detection in blood, there was no statistical significance in
mortality rate between patients with CMV infection (OR:
1.69, 95% CI 0.81–3.54, I2 = 52%, n = 722) as compared
with patients without infection (Additional file 3: Figure
S2).
The mean difference in mechanical ventilation days
and duration of ICU stay was an increase of 9 days (95%
CI 5–14, I2 = 81%, n = 875) and 12 days (95% CI 7–17,
I
2 = 70%, n = 949), respectively, between patients with
and without CMV infection (Fig. 4a and b). When ana￾lysis was limited to CMV detection in blood, there was
still a statistically significant difference in length of
mechanical ventilation and ICU stay between patients
with CMV infection as compared with patients without
infection (MD: 7 days (95% CI 3–11, I2 = 77%, n = 547)
and MD: 9 days (95% CI 4–13, I2 = 66%, n = 547)), re￾spectively (Additional file 4: Figure s3 and Add￾itional file 5: Figure s4).
CMV reactivation and outcome in immunocompetent
patients
The CMV seropositivity rate, which represents previous
infection, was 71% (95% CI 68–75%, I2 = 35%, n = 1242)
in immunocompetent ICU patients (Fig. 5a). Patients

with CMV reactivation, which represents CMV detected
among seropositive patients, was 31% (95% CI 24–39%,
I
2 = 72%, n = 666) (Fig. 5b).
The OR for mortality in patients with CMV reactiva￾tion as compared with patients without CMV reactiva￾tion was 1.72 (95% CI 1.04–2.85, I2 = 29%, n = 664)
(Fig. 5c). But for patients of CMV infection in blood,
the reactivation was not associated with higher mor￾tality (OR: 1.49, 95% CI 0.46–4.28, I2 = 63%, n = 469)
(Additional file 6: Figure S5).
We also analyzed the rate of CMV and mortality
thought categorized by the detection methods (Add￾itional file 7: Figure S6, Additional file 8: Figure S7: Add￾itional file 9: Figure S8 and Additional file 10: Figure S9).
Publication bias and sensitivity analysis
We used the Egger test to detect publication bias. There
was no publication bias either in the overall CMV preva￾lence analysis (t = 1.1264, p = 0.2766) or in the all-cause
CMV mortality analysis (t = − 1.3418, p = 0.1984). We
also used Begg’s test to detect sensitivity analysis, and
the results showed that the analyses were robust.
Discussion
In this meta-analysis, we have demonstrated that CMV
infection frequently present in critically ill immunocom￾petent patients at ICU admission. The overall rate of
CMV infection was 27%, which was higher than the 17%
presented in a previous meta-analysis [29], because eight
recent studies detecting CMV infection by PCR assay
were included in our meta-analysis [10–15, 32, 33]. Poly￾merase chain reaction has been demonstrated to be the
most sensitive method of CMV detection [34], but even
so, the CMV infection rate may still be underestimated
because we chose only the studies containing 2 × 2 tables
on CMV results and all-cause mortality. We excluded
studies where either the rate of CMV infection or mor￾tality was zero and we also excluded some studies with a
0% infection rate that used early monitoring of CMV,
often fewer than 7 days after admission to the ICU [26,
35–37]. We believe this could have led to underestima￾tion of the CMV infection rate because the transition to
CMV infection requires time for the complete lytic virus
cycle to develop from the latent phase [38].
We found that the detection rate of CMV by culture,
pp65 and PCR was 13, 22 and 34%, respectively. Desachy

et al. demonstrated that positive results for CMV infec￾tion were obtained in a median of 4 days by PCR com￾pared with 11 days by pp65 antigen detection after onset
of sepsis [36]. Therefore, PCR facilitates earlier diagnosis
of an episode of CMV infection than any other method.
We then analyzed the association between CMV positiv￾ity and mortality, stratified by detection method. We
also found that patients with CMV infection detected by
PCR had higher mortality than patients without CMV
infection (OR: 2.07, 95% CI 1.59–2.70, I2 = 40%, n =
1441). However, when compared with other methods,
the association with mortality was marginally less strong
using PCR. We may think that viral burden of CMV is
determinant of pathogenesis, and higher CMV loads is
correlated with progression of some CMV infection dis￾ease [39, 40].
The presence of CMV seropositivity, representing pre￾vious infection, was found in 71% of immunocompetent
ICU patients and the incidence of CMV reactivation was
high, observed in 31% of seropositive patients in our
meta-analysis. There are several factors that might ex￾plain the high prevalence. First of all, the rate of CMV
seropositivity increases with advancing age [5] and in
our analysis, the median age was 59 years. Second, to in￾hibit the reactivation of CMV, as many as 10% of all per￾ipheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are constantly required
for immune surveillance to maintain functional latency
[41]. Sepsis is associated with immunoparalysis, as apop￾tosis of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is increased [42, 43].
Furthermore, some patients in the ICU may be immuno￾suppressed after trauma and major surgery [44]. In
addition, treatments commonly received in the ICU,
such as massive transfusion, corticosteroids, or catechol￾amines may transiently compromise host immunity [45].
It has also been reported that the use of heart-lung ma￾chines can lead to temporary systemic immunosuppres￾sion [46]. Therefore, patients in the ICU may show
transient immunoparalysis [47], potentially resulting in
the observed CMV reactivation. Third, some inflamma￾tory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha and

interleukin-1β, can stimulate reactivation of latent CMV
[48]. Thus, significant numbers of immunocompetent
patients harboring latent virus are susceptible to CMV
reactivation during critical illness.
When the mortality analysis was limited to CMV
detection in blood, CMV infection without antiviral
drug treatment or reactivation was not significantly
associated with higher mortality. This maybe ex￾plained that the presence of high peripheral levels of
functional CMV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in
immunocompetent patients, which can suppress CMV
during episodes of reactivation [26]. It was observed
that CMV infection was not associated with mortality
in CMV colitis. In steroid-refractory patients with ul￾cerative colitis, CMV was found in the colon by
histopathology, which is also not associated with ad￾verse clinical outcomes [49]. Indeed, there has been
no research to demonstrate that immunocompetent
critically patients with CMV infection could benefit
from antivirus therapy. And there are a number of
side effects of antiviral drugs, such as hematologic
complications (neutropenia, anemia and
thrombocytopenia), renal dysfunction, mental disor￾ders [50]. Therefore, giving antiviral drugs to critically
ill patients should be considered cautiously in terms
of advantage-disadvantage ratio. To address this issue,
there are two ongoing, blinded, randomized
placebo-controlled clinical trials of an antiviral drug
with activity against CMV in critically ill patients in
the ICU (NCT 01335932, NCT 02152358).
Patients with sepsis have the highest incidence of
CMV infection [22]. Early in 1990’s, bacterial sepsis
was considered to trigger CMV reactivation [26]. The
reactivation associated with sepsis was consequence of
inflammatory stimulation, transient immune com￾promise, and maybe involving some component of
epigenetic regulation of viral DNA [26].
There are five limitations in this study. First, we ob￾served large heterogeneity in many of our analyses.
However, little or no heterogeneity was observed in
the meta-analysis of mortality outcome. Second, most
studies were not blind, thus reducing the reliability of
the results. Third, lack of sufficient data on clinical
parameters (eg: severity of illness, cause of ICU ad￾mission, comorbidity) meant that stratified analyses
based on such clinical characteristics were not pos￾sible. Fourth, the definition of the state of CMV in￾fection was inconsistent and maybe restrictive to
capture the dynamics of CMV infection. As such, we
could not conduct meta-analysis with outcome data
and this is a major limitation of our meta-analysis. Fi￾nally, one [10] cannot discount the effect of unmeas￾ured confounders given the observational nature of
the body of evidence comprising this meta-analysis.
Conclusions
Our findings suggests that there is a high incidence of
CMV seropositivity and CMV infection in critically ill
patients without immunosuppression. This study suggest
that CMV infection without antiviral drug treatment or
reactivation in critically ill patients is associated with in￾creased mortality, and is not associated with mortality
when CMV infection is detected in blood. Further re￾search is necessary to determine the full role of CMV in
this vulnerable patient demographic.
