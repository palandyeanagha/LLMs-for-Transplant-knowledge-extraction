and ultrasound study

Abstract
Hepatic haemangiomas are the most common
benign tumours of the liver and commonly
present as incidental findings on sonographic
examination of the abdomen. Since little is
known of the natural course of these tumours,
we performed a clinical and sonographic
follow up of 123 haemangioma patients. Our
prospective study investigated clinical and
sonographic findings in 158 haemangiomas for
periods of 12 to 60 months. Ninety nine
haemangiomas measured <2 cm and had an
echogenic pattern; 40 were between 2 cm and
5 cm with a mainly echogenic structure; 19
measured >5 cm and showed a mixed echo
pattern. At the first examination only eight
patients, all with giant haemangiomas, pre￾sented symptoms which could be attributed
to the tumour. During follow up only one
haemangioma changed in shape and size.
One patient who was symptom free at the
first examination experienced right upper
abdominal quadrant pain during follow up. No
deterioration occurred in any of the patients
with symptoms at the first examination, and all
had a satisfactory quality of life. No complica￾tions arose during the follow up period. This
study shows that in adults haemangiomas
remain stable in size and echo patterns rarely
change. Only haemangiomas >5 cm may cause
symptoms. Prolonged clinical and sonographic
follow up of small and medium sized haeman￾giomas is not warranted.
Hepatic haemangiomas are the most commonly
detected benign liver tumours. Before the wide￾spread use of diagnostic imaging techniques the
natural history of haemangiomas was based on
necropsy findings,' 2 incidental surgical find￾ings,3 or, more rarely, treatment for complica￾tions of haemangioma (intrahepatic or peritoneal
bleeding).4

In view of this, little is known of the natural
history of these tumours and management is still
the subject of debate. As yet there is no agree￾ment on whether giant haemangiomas should be
resected to prevent rupture or further growth
which could preclude subsequent surgery.
Ultrasonographic diagnosis of hepatic
haemangiomas has proved an accurate tech￾nique.517 As it is not invasive and easily repeated,
it is an ideal way of charting the course of these
tumours.8 We set out to establish the natural
history of haemangiomas by monitoring sono￾graphic changes in size, shape, and echo pattern
alongside clinical features.
Methods
Over a period of seven years (January 1981-
December 1987) haemangiomas were found in
292 out of 21 280 patients who were referred to
our ultrasound unit, giving a prevalence of 1 4%.
Of these 292 patients, 123 were enrolled in an
ultrasonographic and clinical follow up study
lasting from 12 to 60 months (average 21.6
months). There were 41 men (33.4%) and 82
women (66 6%) aged between 20 and 79 years;
mean age was 56- 1 years for men and 52.3 years
for women.
Lesions were found as follows: 75 6% of
patients had one, 21-2% presented with two, and
only 3.2% had three or more. Altogether, we
monitored 158 haemangiomas: 99 were under
2 cm in size (62.6%), 40 were between 2 cm
and 5 cm (25 4%), and 19 had a maximum
diameter of over 5 cm (12-0%) (Table I).
In 31% of cases haemangiomas were detected
during investigation for staging or follow up of
patients with neoplasia, or both. Ultrasono￾graphy was performed for suspected gall
bladder or bile duct lithiasis in 22.9% of patients,
dyspepsia in 21%, abdominal pain in 6.5%,
abnormal liver function tests in 7.3%, abdominal
mass in 1[6%, and other causes in 10-5%.
In the largest group of lesions measuring
under 2 cm the final diagnosis was established on
the basis of sonographic features, clinical
observation, negative biochemical results (in
particular, aspartate and alanine transaminase,
alkaline phosphatase, and y glutamyltranspep￾tidase activities and concentrations of carcino￾embryonic antigen and a fetoprotein), and above
all the findings of at least six months' clinical and
sonographic follow up, which is a valid diag￾nostic criterion.79

confidence intervals shown. laparoscopy). The remaining seven haeman￾giomas were diagnosed according to the above
clinical, biochemical, and sonographic criteria;
none of these patients had a past history of
malignancy.
In all 17 patients with giant haemangiomas the
final diagnosis was made by computed tomo￾graphy (nine cases), 99mTc-red blood cell radio￾nuclide scans (six cases), laparoscopy (four
cases), and angiography (four cases). Some
patients were subjected to more than one
imaging technique.
Ultrasonography was performed with an SSD
Aloka 256 real time scanner using a 3.5 MHz
linear transducer; images were recorded by
Polaroid. At least three transverse, longitudinal,
and anteroposterior measurements were taken of
each lesion. When none of the three diameters
coincided with the maximum diameter of the
haemangioma a section containing the maximum
diameter was measured. Changes in size within
an upper or lower limit of 2 mm were not
considered important owing to the measurement
limitations of the equipment.
Clinical and sonographic follow up was per￾formed in all patients at three and six months in
the first year and annually thereafter.
Results
The male:female ratio of the 123 haemangioma
patients in the follow up study was 1:2. This ratio
was not significantly different from that found in
the 292 patients found to have haemangioma
(95% confidence interval). Average age was

similar for men and women in the two groups
with lesions of s-2 cm and between 2 cm and
5 cm, while there was a difference of a decade in
the group with haemangiomas over 5 cm. Results
are summarised in Table I. The age distribution
of the patients with a haemangioma does not
reflect the age distribution of patients referred
for ultrasound examination (Fig 1).
ULTRASONOGRAPHIC FOLLOW UP
The sonographic appearance of the haeman￾giomas at the first observation was hyperechoic
in 84.8% of cases and hypoechoic in only 1.8%.
The lesions presented a mixed echo pattern in
13.4%, with hyperechoic areas alternating with
hypoechoic or anechoic areas. All haemangiomas
under 2 cm had an echogenic pattern. Those
measuring between 2 cm and 5 cm were mainly
hyperechoic, but a mixed echo pattern was seen
in 12% of cases. Lesions over 5 cm presented
mainly mixed echo patterns (78%) as reported in
Table II. During the follow up period there were
no appreciable changes in the size and sono￾graphic features of haemangiomas under 2 cm
and those between 2 cm and 5 cm. Most of these
lesions presented a homogeneous hyperechoic
pattern, which simplified the comparison of
sonograms over time.
In the group of giant haemangiomas (diameter
over 5 cm) the sonographic features changed in
one man during the third year of follow up. The
maximum diameter of his lesion had increased
by 1 5 cm and wide echo free areas were present
in the middle of the haemangioma (Fig 2). This
enlargement was confirmed by computed tomo￾graphy with bolus infusion of contrast medium
compared with the previous scan three years
earlier. In the other 16 patients the sonograms
were unchanged.
CLINICAL FOLLOW UP
All the haemangiomas under 2 cm or between
2 cm and 5 cm were found incidentally during
ultrasound examination, usually during screen￾ing for liver metastases in cancer patients or for
suspected biliary disease. During follow up none
of these patients presented symptoms which
could be correlated with the haemangioma.
Eight of the 17 patients with hepatic haeman￾giomas over 5 cm were symptomatic at the first
examination: seven reported discomfort in the
right upper abdominal quadrant and feelings of
fullness (but three of these also had gall bladder
lithiasis); one patient presented with an episode
of abdominal pain with fever, slight jaundice,
and choluria (the lesion was located in segment
IV). The other nine patients were asymptomatic
at the first examination, although five had
clinically evident hepatomegaly and in two an
abdominal mass was palpable. The other three
patients screened presented no symptoms or
clinical signs at the first examination.
During follow up, eight of the nine asympto￾matic patients remained symptom free. One
patient experienced an acute episode of pain in
the right upper abdominal quadrant during
physical exercise, which lasted several hours and
was accompanied by raised activity of hepatic

Symptoms subsided in six of the eight patients
with giant lesions who were symptomatic at the
first examination. The patient with abdominal
pain and choluria has not had recurrent episodes
during a three year follow up even though his
haemangioma had increased in diameter.
Symptoms remained unchanged in two patients
but their quality of life has been acceptable.
During follow up none of the patients with a
giant haemangioma had major complications
such as bleeding, rupture, fever, or thrombo￾cytopenia.
Discussion
Haemangiomas are the most common benign
liver tumours,'0 with a prevalence varying from
1.4% to 2-3% in necropsy, surgical,'211 or, more
recently, ultrasonographic series.'2 In our series
the prevalence was found to be 1-4%.
The diagnostic problems related to the fre￾quent occurrence of this tumour have been
largely resolved by state of the art imaging
techniques (computed tomography and ultra￾sonography).79 '3 Above all, ultrasonography has
provided a great deal of information on the
natural course of these lesions of which little has
been known because of the lack of published
reports.8 14
The male:female ratio of the patients in our
clinical and ultrasonographic follow up was 1:2,
in agreement with other series'3 1' but lower than
reported by other workers who noted a female
prevalence of up to 5: 1.3
Incidental detection of haemangiomas is most
common in the third, fourth, and fifth decades of
life. 16 In our series the average age was similar for
men (56.7 years) and women (52.3 years). Con￾sidering only those patients with so called giant
haemangiomas (diameter over 5 cm), the average
age at detection was a decade lower in women
than in men, as reported by Trastek et al. 14 This
finding is not related to contraceptive use, as
none of the women in our series had a history of
oral contraceptive use.
During our follow up study the size and
sonographic features of small and medium sized
haemangiomas remained unchanged. In the
group with giant lesions over 5 cm only one
tumour increased in size with a changed echo
pattern, but this finding was incidental and not
accompanied by symptoms. Haemangioma
enlargement has been reported in other series,8 14
and there is general agreement that the lesions
increase in size after bleeding or intratumoral
thrombosis or because of ectasia of the vascular
channels rather than because of new growth.2' 17
The role of female hormones in the develop￾ment and growth of hepatic haemangiomas is
under discussion.'8 These lesions arise mainly in
women and rapid tumour growth has been
reported in a 57 year old woman after exogenous
oestrogen administration'9 and during preg￾nancy.202' Two cases of haemangiomas compli￾cated by intraperitoneal bleeding have also been
described in pregnant women.4 Haemangiomas
remained unchanged in the group of women who
experienced menopause during the follow up
period, and our only case of tumour enlargement
was in a young man. None of the haemangiomas
decreased in size even though reduction has been
described81 4 and may be due to fibrous replace￾ment.22
Clinical symptoms are present in only a small
proportion of haemangioma patients'4 18 20 23 and
only those with giant lesions" 24; symptoms in￾clude abdominal swelling, abdominal mass,
hepatomegaly, sudden upper abdominal
quadrant pain, and symptoms arising from com￾pression of surrounding organs. In our series
6.5% of patients were symptomatic at the first
examination with symptoms directly related to
the tumour, and none experienced a worsening
of symptoms during follow up.
As regards patients who were symptom free at
the first examination, only one had symptoms
during follow up, consisting of sudden
abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant. His
accompanying symptoms (mild jaundice, in￾creased alkaline phasphatase and y glutamyl￾transferase) and the position of the haemangioma
(segments IV and V) suggest that the pain he
experienced could have been due to transient bile
duct compression. Another patient presented at
the first examination with pain and mild jaundice
mimicking biliary colic, and similar cases have
been reported in other series.'6 Although when
present symptoms depend on the size of the
haemangioma, according to Ishak and Rabin,'8
we believe that tumours located in segments IV
and V are likely to cause discomfort. As the gall
bladder and bile ducts are adjacent to this area,
symptoms may occur even when haemangiomas
are not particularly large.
Older reports have noted a high percentage of
complications in adult haemangioma patients
varying from 4-5% to 19.7%.`8 The major risk is
rupture with intraperitoneal haemorrhage,
which is fatal in 75% of cases4 but fortunately is
rare in tumours under 10 cm.9 There are only
anecdotal reports of life threatening complica￾tions in more recent series,25-27 indicating that
risks are small compared with the high incidence
of haemangiomas. During our follow up none of
the patients with giant haemangiomas had any
complications, although the limited length of
follow up should be taken into account. There is
no evidence that haemangiomas become malig￾nant, and none of the cases monitored in our
series became malignant.

recent studies reporting few complications814
raise the question of whether the risks of surgi￾cally resecting giant asymptomatic haeman￾giomas outweigh the risks of haemorrhage or
enlargement. In fact, surgical management
carries some degree of risk.'420242728 So far alter￾native therapeutic approaches, such as hepatic
artery ligation or embolisation, have failed to
shrink haemangiomas or improve symptoms and
they carry the risk of ischaemia and infec￾tion.14 26 29
Our study shows that prolonged ultrasound
follow up of small and medium sized haeman￾giomas is not warranted. Short term follow up
(6-12 months) is useful when the final diagnosis
has not been established by other techniques in
order to differentiate the haemangioma from
malignant lesions, especially secondary tumours
