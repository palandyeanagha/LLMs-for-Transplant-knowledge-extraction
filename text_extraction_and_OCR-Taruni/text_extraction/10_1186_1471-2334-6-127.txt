Abstract
Background: Combined kidney pancreas transplantation (PTx) evolved as excellent treatment for
diabetic nephropathy. Infections remain common and serious complications.
Methods: 217 consecutive enteric drained PTxs performed from 1997 to 2004 were
retrospectively analyzed with regard to bloodstream infection. Immunosuppression consisted of
antithymocyteglobuline induction, tacrolimus, mycophenolic acid and steroids for the majority of
cases. Standard perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis consisted of pipercillin/tazobactam in
combination with ciprofloxacin and fluconazole.
Results: One year patient, pancreas and kidney graft survival were 96.4%, 88.5% and 94.8%,
surgical complication rate was 35%, rejection rate 30% and rate of infection 59%. In total 46 sepsis
episodes were diagnosed in 35 patients (16%) with a median onset on day 12 (range 1–45) post
transplant. Sepsis source was intraabdominal infection (IAI) (n = 21), a contaminated central venous
line (n = 10), wound infection (n = 5), urinary tract infection (n = 2) and graft transmitted (n = 2).
Nine patients (4%) experienced multiple episodes of sepsis. Overall 65 pathogens (IAI sepsis 39,
line sepsis 15, others 11) were isolated from blood. Gram positive cocci accounted for 50 isolates
(77%): Coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 28, i.e. 43%) (nine multi-resistant), Staphylococcus
aureus (n = 11, i.e. 17%) (four multi-resistant), enterococci (n = 9, i.e. 14%) (one E. faecium). Gram
negative rods were cultured in twelve cases (18%). Patients with blood borne infection had a two
year pancreas graft survival of 76.5% versus 89.4% for those without sepsis (p = 0.036), patient
survival was not affected.
Conclusion: Sepsis remains a serious complication after PTx with significantly reduced pancreas
graft, but not patient survival. The most common source is IAI.

Background
Simultaneous pancreas kidney transplantation (SPK) has
evolved as an effective treatment modality for patients
with end stage diabetic nephropathy with excellent
patient, pancreas and kidney graft survival [1]. This
improved outcome has mainly been achieved by a reduc￾tion in technical failures and more powerful immunosup￾pression with agents such as Tacrolimus, Sirolimus and
mycophenolic acid (MMF) [2-5]. However, these more
powerful new immunosuppressive protocols may lead to
an increase in infectious complications [6,7]. Intraab￾dominal infection (IAI) has been shown to be frequently
associated with blood stream infection and IAI with sepsis
frequently leads to graft loss [6]. Blood stream infections
(BSI) seem to influence both graft and patient survival
[8,9]. Systemic infections may originate from intraab￾dominal, renal or pulmonary origin or contaminated
intravenous lines [10]. The spectrum of pathogens iso￾lated from blood culture or from catheter tips differs
between line sepsis and sepsis from other sources [11].
Coagulase negative staphylococci seem to be the predom￾inant organisms causing line sepsis, whereas the spectrum
of sepsis deriving from other sources is much more diverse
[12]. Long term vascular access devices such as dialysis
catheters have a particular high risk to become contami￾nated [13]. The diagnosis of sepsis post transplant may be
difficult, because immunosuppressive agents influence
parameters, which are indicative for inflammation such as
the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and the white blood
count (WBC) and moreover, these parameters can be ele￾vated during graft rejection [14]. Furthermore, during the
early post transplant period fever can be caused by a mul￾titude of events and due to the application of steroids
patients will not develop pyrexia, even in the case of
proven infection. Therefore, a positive blood culture must
be considered a serious event and prompt further investi￾gations even if patients do not present with any clinical
signs of infection. It seems to be justified to monitor tips
of indwelling devices in order to diagnose infection at the
earliest possible time point.
The more physiologic enteric exocrine drainage (ED) for
pancreas transplantation is now widely accepted, but it is
associated with a higher risk for intraabdominal infec￾tions and subsequent sepsis as compared to bladder
drainage [15,16]. Due to the underlying disease, the nec￾essary central venous access and the high prevalence of
IAI, pancreatic recipients are at high risk to develop sys￾temic infections. Data on sepsis in pancreatic recipients
are scarce, in particular with regard to cohorts receiving
more powerful immunosuppression, patients with
advanced age or those suffering from type II diabetes mel￾litus, and when using grafts from extended criteria donors.
Also it is not clearly defined, if retransplantation is associ￾ated with a higher risk for sepsis.
In this study of 217 consecutive enteric/systemic drained
pancreas transplants all cases of bloodstream infections
were retrospectively analyzed. Risk factors for the develop￾ment of sepsis were investigated and the impact of sepsis
on patient, renal and pancreas graft survival with regard to
the different sources was determined.
Methods
This is a consecutive cohort study including all patients
who underwent pancreas transplantation at a single center
during a seven year period.
Donor and recipient demographics
Between March 1997 and October 2004, 217 consecutive
patients (m/f = 133/84) with a median age of 41.9 years
(range 22.4–62.5) underwent pancreas transplantation at
our center: 89% together with a kidney from the same
donor, which was placed retroperitoneally in the left iliac
fossa (SPK). Twenty patients received a pancreas graft
sometime after kidney transplantation (PAK), and three
patients a pancreas transplant alone (PTA). In 24
instances the pancreas (three times as SPK and 21 times
after a previous kidney or kidney/pancreas transplant)
and in three cases the kidney were retransplants. Fourteen
patients suffered from type II diabetes mellitus. Mean
donor age was 29 years (range 10–54). Mean cold
ischemia time for the kidney transplants was 11.7 ± 3.3
hrs, and for the pancreas transplants 13.1 ± 3.2 hrs. All
pancreatic grafts were revascularized in an end-to-side
fashion with the inferior vena cava and via a donor iliac Y￾graft with the right common iliac artery. Exocrine drainage
was completed as S/S duodeno-jejunostomy except for
two duodenocystostomies, in the last 153 instances using
a stapling device [3].
Immunosuppression
213 patients received a single shot antithymocyteglob￾uline (ATG) (Thymoglobulin, Sangstat or ATG Fresenius)
at begin of surgery or a three days course at a lower dosage.
One patient did not receive antibody induction during
pancreas retransplantation, and three patients received
basiliximab (Simulect ®, Novartis, Switzerland) or daclizu￾mab (Zenapax ® Roche, Switzerland). MMF (Roche, Swit￾zerland) was given at a dose of 1 g twice daily orally. A
rapid steroid tapering regimen was applied starting with
500 mg Methylprednisolon intraoperatively to reach a
dose of 25 mg at the end of the first p.o. week and further
reduction to a maintenance daily dose of 5 mg. 198
patients received oral Tacrolimus (Tac, Fujisawa, Munich,
Germany) at 0.08 mg/kg/day twice daily, starting six
hours after revascularization. The Tac dose was adjusted to
achieve whole blood trough levels of 10–12 ng/ml for the
first three months after transplantation, 8–10 ng/ml for
6–12 months and 6–8 ng/ml thereafter. A total of 11
patients were given Cyclosporin A (CsA, Novartis, Basle,

Switzerland) instead of Tac (targeted trough levels of 200–
250 ng/dl) and another 19 received Sirolimus (Whyeth,
USA) with targeted trough levels of 6–10 ng/ml in combi￾nation with Tac as initial immunosuppression. Four
patients were switched from Tac to CsA and another four
from CsA to Tac. CsA was only used during the early study
period (1997–1998) as part of the EURO SPK I trial and
Sirolimus was introduced 2002 as part of the EURO SPK
II trial.
Perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis
A total of 30 patients transplanted between 1997 and
1998 received Amoxicillin/Clavulanic acid 3 × 2, 2 g and
157 patients transplanted between 1998 and 2004
received Piperacillin/Tazobactam 3 × 4, 5 g for 48–72
hours as perioperative systemic antimicrobial prophylaxis
and 30 patients received other antimicrobials in case of
Penicillin allergy. Quinolones were added as prophylactic
agents in the last 106 cases. A total of 168 patients in addi￾tion received Fluconazol (400 mg daily) for seven days.
Prophylaxis for CMV infection was used in 31 CMV seron￾egative patients receiving a CMV positive graft (Ganciclo￾vir 2 × 5 mg/kg/day for 10 days, followed by 3000 mg
orally for 2 months or recently Valganciclovir 2 × 450
mg). All other patients were monitored on a weekly basis
and treated preemptively if tested positive for CMV repli￾cation.
Bacterial/fungal monitoring
Immediately before transplantation a sample of preserva￾tion solution and parts of the donor ureter, ascites and
urine from the recipient were taken. Post-transplant tips
of removed urinary as well as intravascular catheters as
well as tips of all intraabdominal drains were sent for
microbiological investigation. During ICU stay fluids
from thoracic or intraabdominal drains and tracheal or
bronchial secretions were taken every day. Sputa, tracheal
aspirations, bronchoalveolar lavages, aspiration fluids,
wound swabs, cerebrospinal fluid, blood and biopsies
were sent whenever indicated. Blood cultures were taken
in cases of fever (higher 38 centigrade): two to four con￾secutive samples within four hours. These samples were
cultured aerobically as well as anaerobically for seven days
before being reported out negative.
Definition of sepsis
Bacterial/fungal infection was assumed when a positive
culture and clinical signs and/or laboratory parameters
requiring antibiotic treatment. Positive surveillance cul￾tures without clinical symptoms were considered coloni￾zation. In all cases of sepsis in this series a causing
organism could be cultured from blood or a catheter tip or
both. Positive blood culture or isolation of an organism
from blood without clinical symptoms or laboratory
abnormalities were not considered sepsis but prompted
further investigations. Clinical signs included fever higher
38 centigrade; laboratory indicators were leucocytosis (>
10000 WBC) or leucopenia (< 3000 WBC) and elevated
C-reactive protein (CRP). For coagulase negative staphylo￾cocci, sepsis was only considered if two isolates from
blood cultures or one positive blood culture with a second
isolate from a contaminated line or other source of sepsis
were present.
Viral monitoring
The donor CMV status was recorded from the report of the
donor center and for the recipient on pretransplant serol￾ogy (anti CMV IgG and IgM antibodies). All patients
underwent weekly testing for Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
antigen (phosphoprotein 65: pp65) or the Digene DNA
CMV hybrid capture assay. In 2003 CMV PCR (Roche ®
Amplicor, Switzerland) was introduced into clinical prac￾tice.
Data collection and statistical analysis
A database was created using Microsoft excel 5.0. For each
patient an individual datasheet was completed, which
contained daily body temperature, laboratory results,
immunosuppressive and antimicrobial therapy as well as
all results from microbiological investigations. Baseline
data were prospectively collected and supplemented by
retrospectively collected data such as complications, graft
loss and death. Statistical analysis was carried out using
MS excel and SPSS including Chi-square test and non par￾ametric Mann-Whitney-U or Kruskal-Wallis assay. Data
are reported as median with minimum/maximum range,
mean ± SD. Survival was calculated using the Kaplan￾Meier method. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statisti￾cally significant.
Results
Patient and graft survival
The median follow up was 3.2 years (range: 0.1–7.8).
Overall one- and three-year actuarial patient survival was
96.4% and 94%, respectively. From the 14 deaths, which
occurred median 15 months (range 1–74) post trans￾plant, ten occurred with functioning grafts and the
remaining four patients lost the pancreatic or renal graft
function prior to death. The causes of death were myocar￾dial infarction in five cases, haemorrhage and cerebrovas￾cular insult in one patient each, de novo malignancies in
another two patients and infection in the remaining five
cases including one pneumonia, one viral infection
(HHV6, CMV) and three filamentous fungal infections.
No patient died directly related to a blood borne infec￾tion.
Kidney one- and three-year survival was calculated to be
94.8% and 93.2%. Seventeen renal grafts (7.7%) were lost
after three years. One kidney was lost due to early arterial

thrombosis and another due to Polyomavirus-infection.
Two patients lost their renal grafts due to chronic dysfunc￾tion, in one case associated with drug toxicity and in the
other this was due to non compliance. One patient devel￾oped infective endocarditis of the tricuspid valve and
developed septic arterial graft thrombosis leading to renal
graft loss. The patient underwent valve repair but died
later on from invasive zygomycosis. The remaining losses
were death with functioning graft (DWFG).
Overall one- and three-year pancreas graft survival was
88.5% and 83.8%. Of the 217 pancreas grafts, 182 (84%)
are currently functioning without exogenous insulin and
normal HbA1c levels at a median follow up of 3.2 (range
0.1–7.8) years. Causes of the 35 pancreas graft losses were
irreversible rejection/dysfunction (n = 9), intraabdominal
infection (n = 5), arterial thrombosis/infarction (n = 9),
arterial bleeding (n = 2), and death with functioning graft
(n = 11). Therefore, technical failure (16 grafts) was the
most common cause of graft loss with thrombosis
accounting for the majority of cases.
Post operative course
During first hospitalization, a total of 75 rejection epi￾sodes in 65 patients (30%) were treated. In 60 instances
out of 217 transplants (27%) one or more relaparotomies
for surgical complications were necessary within the first
post operative (p.o.) year. During the p.o. stay patients
developed sub febrile temperatures on 33% and fever over
38 centigrade on 9% of observation days.
Infectious complications
Within the first three months a total of 208 infectious epi￾sodes following 119 transplants were recorded. Another
48 infectious episodes were diagnosed during further fol￾low up. The spectrum of infectious complications is
shown in table 2, recurrent infections of the same type
were not counted separately. Sepsis was the third most
common infectious complication in this series. Only IAI
(56 episodes in 47 patients) were diagnosed more fre￾quently and CMV infection and disease (in total 53
patients, six with recurrent episodes). The incidence of the
latter significantly declined after change from a preemp￾tive strategy to Ganciclovir prophylaxis for high risk
patients.
Monitoring of catheters
In total 322 tips of central venous catheters were sent for
microbiological investigation. Of those 221 (69%) were
sterile. There were 19 mixed infections. In total 121 path￾ogens were cultivated including 103 gram positive cocci,
14 gram negative rods and four non fermentative bacilli.
Figure 1a shows the spectrum of pathogens. Large diame￾ter catheters (n = 27) were independently analyzed. None
of the nine pulmonary arterial catheters (Swan Ganz) was
contaminated, whereas six of nine large pore catheters
(multiresistant Staphylococcus aureus 2, coagulase nega￾tive Staphylococci 2, multiresistant coagulase negative
Staphylococci 1 and multiresistant coagulase negative Sta￾phylococci/Serratia spp. 1) and four of nine Quinton
catheters (coagulase negative Staphylococci 3, Enterococ￾cus fecalis 1) were contaminated.
Results from blood cultures
A total of 338 blood cultures were analyzed (multiple
blood cultures taken in the same patient on the same day
was considered one event) and 66 pathogens were iso￾lated including 49 Gram positive cocci, ten Gram negative
rods and Propionibacterium acnes and Candida albicans
in one case each. There were six blood cultures that grew
multiple organisms. When looking at the total number of
blood cultures (n = 439), 379 were sterile and 60 (14%)
showed growth of pathogens. Figure 1b depicts the spec￾trum of pathogens isolated from blood cultures.

Sepsis
In total 46 sepsis episodes were diagnosed in 35 patients
(16%). Nine patients experienced multiple sepsis epi￾sodes with four patients having both IAI with sepsis and
line sepsis. In 60% (21 patients) the source of sepsis was
IAI, in ten cases the source was a contaminated line and in
eight cases other sources were identified. The median
onset of sepsis associated with IAI was on day 12 (range
6–45), for line sepsis it was day 12 (range 6–32) and for
other causes of septic episodes it was on day 13 (range 1–
24) post transplant. The sepsis source in the latter cases
were urinary tract (n = 2), graft transmitted (n = 2) and
wound infection (n = 5). In total 65 pathogens (IAI sepsis
39, line sepsis 15, others 11) were isolated from blood.
Table 3 shows demographic data and the spectrum of
organisms according to the source of sepsis. Gram positive
cocci accounted for the vast majority of pathogens causing
sepsis (50 of the 65 isolates, i.e. 75%). The most com￾monly isolated single pathogens were coagulase negative
staphylococci with 28 isolates of which nine were multire￾sistant, Staphylococcus aureus accounted for eleven cases
(four MRSA) and enterococci for nine cases (one E. fae￾cium). Gram negative rods were cultured in twelve cases.
The most common cause of sepsis originating from IAI
was graft pancreatitis with 10 cases, followed by peritoni￾tis in five cases and infected ascites in two cases. In one
case each an infected peripancreatic seroma, an intraab￾dominal hematoma, graft necrosis due to portal vein
thrombosis and a leak at the distal stapler line of the duo￾denal segment were the source of sepsis. The spectrum of
pathogens changed during the study period with intensi￾fied perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. Whereas for the
first 112 cases polymicrobial infection including Gram
negative rods and Gram positive cocci was present in eight
of 12 cases, during the last 105 cases six of nine sepsis
cases originating from IAI were monomicrobial with CNS
accounting for four episodes. This includes also the
patient with the duodenal leak. In terms of management
of IAI, 18 of the 21 patients with IAI underwent relaparot￾omie; the remaining three percutaneous drainage. In
addition to the above mentioned intraabdominal pathol￾ogy, intraoperative findings were infected hematoma (n =
6), which were associated with pancreatitis in four cases
and a thrombosed graft in one case, wound infection (n =
12), and wound dehiscence (n = 3). During these 18 inter￾ventions four grafts had to be removed.
A significant reduction in the rejection rate was observed
during the study period from 41% for the first 112 cases
to 18% for the following 105 cases. Concomitantly the
rate of blood stream infection rose from 13% to 19%. The
difference did not reach statistic significance.
Out of the 35 patients with sepsis 33 (94.3%) developed
also other infectious complications, whereas 52.7% of the
182 patients who had no sepsis had other infections (p <
0.0001). A total of 15 patients had sepsis and CMV infec￾tion/disease. In eleven of the 15 cases, sepsis onset pro￾ceeded CMV infection/disease, with a median interval of
20 (range 2–109) days. Ganciclovir prophylaxis for all
CMV mismatched transplants in the last 105 cases had a
major impact on the incidence of CMV infection/disease.
Whereas 12 of 15 patients who developed sepsis during
the early period (first 112 cases) also had CMV infection/
disease, only three of 20 patients of the later cohort devel￾oped sepsis and CMV infection/disease.
Table 1 shows demographic and clinical data for patients
with and without sepsis. Donor age (35 versus 28 years)
and Type II diabetes mellitus (17.1% versus 4.4%) were
found to be significant risk factors for the development of
sepsis, whereas recipient age, rejection rate and ischemic
time had no impact. Figure 2 shows pancreas graft survival
for patients with and without sepsis. Patients with blood
borne infections had a one/two and five year graft survival
of 80%/76.5% and 68.9% versus 90%/89.4% and 83.9%

Discussions and conclusion
This study comprising a large number of patients demon￾strates that blood stream infection is a significant compli￾cation in pancreas recipients. In our series 35 patients
(16%) developed systemic infection. Sepsis was the third
most common infection in this series. Most commonly
the source was IAI, however, in eleven cases the source was
a contaminated central venous line. Rare sources were uri￾nary tract infection and wound infection. Of note, in two
cases a contaminated graft resulted in systemic infection.
The most common single pathogen was Staphylococcus
epidermidis. We were able to identify advanced donor
and recipient age and type II diabetes mellitus to be risk
factors for the development of sepsis. Blood stream infec￾tion had a significant impact on pancreatic and renal graft
survival.
Pancreas transplantation has become widely accepted as
therapy for patients with end stage diabetic nephropathy
[2]. According to the International Pancreas Transplant
Registry report, the technical failure rates exceed the
immunological failure rates [1]. In our series of 217 con￾secutive enteric drained pancreas transplants using ATG
induction, Tacrolimus, MMF and steroids prophylactic
immunosuppression one – year patient, pancreas and kid￾ney graft survival was 94%, 83% and 90%. Overall, 30%
of patients had to be treated for rejection. The rejection
rate in this series declined from 41% in earlier cases to
18%, but at the same time the incidence of sepsis
increased from 13% to 19%. For the usage of Sirolimus no
increased infection rate or sepsis rate could be observed,
however, the number of patients receiving this new agent
in this series is too small to draw final conclusions.
Infection remains a common complication following
solid organ transplantation [5,15,17]. Although many of
these infections are well controllable due to rapid detec￾tion and highly active antimicrobial agents, some of them
remain a significant threat for the patient. In pancreas
recipients postoperative infections are reported to occur in
50–100% [7,10,18-21]. Bacterial infections, especially
systemic infection, remain a significant source of morbid￾ity and mortality during the early postoperative period
[6,8]. In our series the overall infection rate was 59% with
sepsis being the third most common infection. Similar to
previously published data, sepsis originating from IAI was
associated with significantly increased hospitalization
and costs and a poorer graft survival [22-25]. The most
common source of systemic infections in our series was
intraabdominal infection. In total 45 out of the 217
patients (20.7%) developed IAI and of 138 organisms
were cultured including Gram positive cocci (n = 69),
Gram positive rods (n = 6), Gram negative rods (n = 35),
non fermentative bacilli (n = 13), anaerobes (n = 7), fungi
(n = 8). Most commonly IAI was associated with pancrea￾titis. Only one case, which led to sepsis, was associated
with an anastomotic leakage. Ten of 15 patients trans￾planted during the early period had multiple episodes of
sepsis. Of these, nine were associated with ongoing IAI.
During the later period only six of 20 patients had multi￾ple episodes of sepsis. This included four patients with
ongoing IAI. In the cases of ongoing IAI causing sepsis
antibiotic therapy had to be adapted several times due to
a shift in the spectrum of isolated pathogens. Severe early
post-transplant IAI was a significant risk factor for graft
loss. Line sepsis was the second most common systemic
infection whereas other sources for sepsis are rare. Nota￾bly, five cases derived from wound infection. Wound
infection in pancreas recipients with long standing diabe￾tes and angiopathy who receive steroids has a tendency of
delayed healing. This might explain the high frequency of
wound infections that spread to the bloodstream. If the
new immunosuppressive agents Sirolimus or Everolimus
are added even slower healing may be expected [26,27].
Coagulase negative staphylococci were the predominant
pathogens causing sepsis in our series regardless of the ori￾gin. One third of these isolates were multiresistant, and
out of nine isolates of Staphylococcus aureus four were
multiresistant. Nevertheless, this fact does not justify to
add a glycopeptide to the prophylactic regimen. However,
if sepsis is suspected, a glycopeptide should be included in
the empiric therapy until blood cultures are reported. No
case of candidemia was observed; however, in eight cases
of IAI, candida was isolated from the abdominal cavity.
Notably for the last 168 cases fluconazole prophylaxis was

used. Per protocol in the case of IAI we include an antifun￾gal agent in the empiric antimicrobial regimen. After a
first case of Candida krusei IAI we use Caspofungin (70
mg starting dose followed by 50 daily) in these cases. The
empiric antibacterial combination for IAI consists prefer￾ably of a Glycopeptide in combination with a Carbap￾enem. For prevention of line sepsis, intravascular
catheters are removed at the earliest possible time point.
This may be particularly important for large diameter cen￾tral venous lines. For prevention of sepsis associated with
urinary tract infection, early removal of the catheter was
performed. In our series only two cases of sepsis associ￾ated with UTI were diagnosed. The incidence of urinary
tract infection in our series was 10% with only 4% during
the early period, however 17% during the later period.
Possibly, the intensified immunosuppression and chang￾ing patient demographics such as increased recipient age
and transplantation of patients suffering from type II DM
could explain this recent increased frequency.
In summary, combined pancreas-kidney transplantation
with systemic venous/enteric exocrine drainage under
Tacrolimus/MMF immunosuppression using a short
course of high dose ATG induction results in a low rate of
immunological graft losses (2.1%/yr at our institution).
However, there remains considerable surgical morbidity
with a 6.5% technical failure rate within the first post
operative year. Infection remains the most common com￾plication and the most common cause of graft loss and
death. Prevention of systemic infections targets for pre￾vention of IAI as first step as IAI is the most common
source. Sterile handling of central venous lines and
removal at the earliest possible time point are further
steps. Importantly, two cases in this series derived from
urinary tract infection and another two cases were trans￾mitted by the graft. Further improvements in pancreas
preservation, improvement in infection prophylaxis and
better control of intraabdominal infectious complications
will be needed to reduce the incidence of bloodstream
infections and further improve results following pancreas
transplantation [6,28,29].
