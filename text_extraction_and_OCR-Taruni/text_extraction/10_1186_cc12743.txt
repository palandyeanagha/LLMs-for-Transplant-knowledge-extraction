Invasive mechanical ventilation as a risk factor
for acute kidney injury in the critically ill:
a systematic review and meta-analysis

Abstract
Introduction: Mechanical ventilation (MV) is commonly regarded as a risk factor for acute kidney injury (AKI) in the
critically ill. We investigated the strength of this association and whether settings of tidal volume (Vt) and positive
end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) affect the risk for AKI.
Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis using studies found by searching MEDLINE,
EMBASE, and references in relevant reviews and articles. We included studies reporting on a relation between the
use of invasive MV and subsequent onset of AKI, or comparing higher with lower Vt or PEEP and subsequent onset
of AKI. All studies clearly stating that MV was initiated after onset of AKI were excluded. We extracted the
proportion with and without MV and AKI. We included 31 studies on invasive MV.
Results: The pooled odds ratio (OR) for the overall effect of MV on AKI was 3.16 (95% CI 2.32 to 4.28, P <0.001).
Nearly all subgroups showed that MV increases the risk for AKI. The pooled OR for studies with a multivariate
analysis including MV as a risk factor for AKI was 3.58 (95% CI 1.85 to 6.92; P <0.001). Different settings of Vt and
PEEP showed no effect.
Conclusions: Invasive MV is associated with a threefold increase in the odds of developing AKI and various
Vt or PEEP settings do not modify this risk. The latter argues in favour of a haemodynamic origin of AKI during
MV.

Introduction
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is - depending on the defini￾tion used - a common complication in the intensive care
unit (ICU) with a high mortality, while it may also
adversely affect long-term survival [1]. It affects up to
29% of patients who are mechanically ventilated [2]. In
1947, Drury et al. [3] were the first to describe the effects
of positive airway pressure on renal function in healthy
individuals. Since then, studies have demonstrated that
mechanical ventilation (MV) affects the kidney [4]. How￾ever, a causal or epidemiological relation between MV
and AKI has only been suggested in narrative reviews
[4-6]. Kuiper et al. [4] proposed that MV may lead to the
development of AKI through haemodynamic factors or
ventilator-induced lung injury by triggering a pulmonary
inflammatory reaction and subsequent systemic release
of inflammatory mediators. Some studies specifically
examined the release of these mediators during MV
[7-9]. The precise relation between MV and subsequent
AKI remains unclear, however.
In this systematic review, our primary objective was to
answer the following questions: does invasive MV contri￾bute to the development of AKI in critically ill adult
patients, and could differences in ventilator settings like
tidal volume (Vt) and positive end-expiratory pressure
(PEEP) have an effect on the development of AKI? A sec￾ondary objective was to answer the question whether there
is a difference between invasive MV and non-invasive MV
(NIV) in the risk for AKI.

Materials and methods
Study eligibility and criteria
We performed a systematic literature search to identify
studies reporting on the proportion of invasive MV used
in critically ill adult patients that did or did not develop
AKI, or reporting on the occurrence of AKI in patients
ventilated with different ventilation strategies, like differ￾ent Vt or levels of PEEP. We excluded studies clearly
reporting that invasive MV was initiated after the onset
of AKI and studies in which renal function was evaluated
during a mean time interval shorter than 48 hours. Ani￾mal studies, articles not in English, studies unavailable as
full text, and studies of paediatric patients were excluded.
We searched the MEDLINE (1966 to present) database
via PubMed and the EMBASE (1980 to present) database
(last search January 2012) using the following keywords:
‘mechanical ventilation’, ‘acute renal failure’, ‘acute kidney
injury’, ‘critically ill’, ‘risk factor’, ‘predictor’, ‘PEEP’, ‘tidal
volume’, and ‘ventilation strategy’; see Table S1 in Addi￾tional file 1 for an example of a search strategy. In order
to find studies not primarily reporting on the relation
between invasive MV and AKI, the Medical Subject Head￾ing label in PubMed was not applied. Instead, we used the
text word [tw] label. We used the ‘related articles’ function
in PubMed to identify eligible studies that were not found
by the main search queries. References of those studies
considered for inclusion and the references of the review
articles were hand searched for eligibility. The ‘cited refer￾ence search’ function of the Web of Knowledge (Thomson
Reuters) was also used to find potential studies citing
those studies considered for inclusion.
Two authors (JPCvdA and ME) screened the title and
abstract of the studies considered for inclusion, and in
case of doubt both screened the full-text article. Two
authors (ME and JPCvdA) then assessed the full-text
article for eligibility and inclusion into the meta-analysis
or the review in an unblinded manner. Disagreement
was settled either by consensus or the third author
(ABJG) made the definitive decision.
Using a predefined study form, one author (ME)
extracted the following variables: study characteristics;
patient characteristics; inclusion and exclusion criteria;
definition of AKI used; time until MV was initiated; defini￾tion and settings of ventilation strategies used; time until
onset of AKI; total study population; group sizes; number
of patients in each group receiving invasive MV or devel￾oping AKI; and, if available, odds ratios (OR) - with confi￾dence intervals (CI) or with P values - for invasive MV as
a risk factor in univariate analysis, multivariate analysis or
both. A second author (JPCvdA) checked all the extracted
data. For patients in a postoperative setting, we categorised
those receiving MV for 24 hours or less as not receiving
MV. We used the term AKI for all forms of renal failure
or dysfunction in the selected studies. We categorised the
studies according to inclusion diagnosis and whether
acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ALI/ARDS) was present or not. Also, we evaluated
whether MV clearly preceded the onset of AKI.
We performed five analyses to answer the questions of
the primary objective: one to answer the question whether
MV has an effect on the onset of AKI overall and in sub￾groups according to inclusion diagnosis; one on the same
question according to the subgroups whether ALI/ARDS
was present or not; one on the same question but only
using the pooled results of studies specifically analysing
MV as a risk factor for AKI in multivariate analysis; one
on studies with higher and lower Vt; and one on studies
with higher and lower PEEP. Two separate analyses were
performed to examine the difference between studies in
which MV clearly preceded the diagnosis of AKI and in
which this temporal relation was not completely clear. To
answer the secondary objective we analysed studies com￾paring invasive MV with NIV.
Statistical analysis
We calculated the OR and corresponding 95% CI using
the total number of patients with and without AKI, and
the proportion receiving invasive MV. The same was done
with the studies examining different ventilator settings. If
these data were not available, we used the reported OR
and 95% CI. The reported univariate and multivariate OR
and 95% CI were examined for rounding errors, and
adjusted accordingly. The OR and corresponding 95% CI
were put into a meta-analysis using a generic inverse var￾iance method and a random effects model due to expected
heterogeneity between studies. Heterogeneity was analysed
using the I2 statistics, and the thresholds for interpretation
were used as defined in the Cochrane Handbook [10].
Publication bias was assessed visually using funnel plots.
Review Manager (RevMan version 5.1. Copenhagen: The
Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration,
2011) was used for the analysis and creating the forest and
funnel plots.
Results
Search
Our search strategies resulted in a total number of 1,951
citations (Figure 1). We also identified 19 studies through
other sources. After removing duplicates, 605 remained.
Of these, 459 met our exclusion criteria after screening
the titles and abstracts. We subsequently assessed the
remaining 146 full-text articles and 111 were excluded
because inclusion criteria were not met or due to insuffi￾cient data. Of the remaining 35 studies, we included 31
studies in our primary analysis. The study characteristics
of 23 studies [11-33] reporting on the use of invasive MV
and renal function in a total number of 10,333 patients
are presented in Table 1 and Table S2 in Additional file 1.

Of these, seven studies [11,12,16,19,23,27,31] specifically
analysed MV as a risk factor for AKI in multivariate analy￾sis. The ventilator settings - Vt and PEEP - and study char￾acteristics of nine studies [11,34-41] with a total number of
1,800 patients are presented in Table 2 and 3 and Table S2
and S3 in Additional file 1, respectively. The remaining
four studies [2,42-44] comparing invasive MV with NIV
were included in our secondary analysis.
Meta-analyses
The pooled results of the 23 studies reporting on the use
of invasive MV and renal function overall and of the sub￾groups are presented in Figure 2. Overall, the pooled OR
for the occurrence of AKI when mechanically ventilated
was about three. All subgroups showed that MV contri￾butes to the development of AKI. The sepsis, influenza A
H1N1, and cardiac subgroups show little heterogeneity,
while the other subgroups have moderate to substantial
heterogeneity. The pooled OR of the studies examining
the studies in which MV clearly preceded the diagnosis
of AKI and in which this temporal relation was not com￾pletely clear are also about three and are reported in
Figure S5 and S6 in Additional file 1. The pooled results
and the subgroups whether ALI/ARDS was present or
not are reported in Figure S7 in Additional file 1, and
also showed a pooled OR of about three. The subgroup
analysis showed an OR of 2.4 and 5.6 whether ALI/ARDS
was present or not, respectively. The pooled results of
the studies reporting that MV is a risk factor for AKI
using multivariate analysis are presented in Figure 3. The
pooled OR for the occurrence of AKI in these studies
was also about three and showed substantial heterogene￾ity. The variables adjusted for in the multivariate analysis
are reported in Table S4 in Additional file 1. The pooled
OR of studies with different settings for Vt and PEEP are
reported in Figure 4 and 5. Different ventilator settings
showed no effect on the development of AKI. A visual
analysis of the funnel plots for each meta-analysis shows
marked asymmetry for the studies reporting multivariate
analyses and results of ventilation strategies (Figure S1 to
S4 in Additional file 1).
The analysis comparing invasive MV with NIV on their
respective contribution to the development of AKI is pre￾sented in Figure S8 in Additional file 1. AKI appears to
develop more often in patients with invasive MV than in
those with NIV.
Discussion
In this systematic review and meta-analysis we show that
invasive MV increases the odds for AKI by a factor of
three, relatively independent of diagnostic subgroups. We
also found an effect with the same magnitude after pooling
studies specifically analysing MV as a risk factor for AKI in
multivariate analysis. Neither Vt nor PEEP had an effect
on the risk for AKI. AKI appears to develop more often in
patients with invasive MV than in those with NIV. The
latter observations argue in favour of haemodynamics as a
major factor causing AKI during MV.

We realize that AKI is preceded by an insult and injury.
It is possible that at the moment MV was started no fail￾ure was yet detected, but insult and injury had already
occurred. Based on the published information, we there￾fore split the studies comparing MV with no MV into
two groups. In the first group, invasive MV clearly pre￾ceded the onset of AKI. In the second group, no defini￾tive distinction was possible between AKI at the start of
MV or after invasive MV was initiated. The OR for the
occurrence of AKI was about three in both groups. We
observed that in four studies [20,26,29,31] an increase in
AKI severity was associated with an increase in the per￾centage of patients who were mechanically ventilated,
suggesting a causal relation. In these studies MV did not
clearly precede the development of AKI. We can only
speculate on the mechanisms of MV-attributable AKI,
including haemodynamic factors and selective renal vaso￾constriction by MV-induced sympathetic stimulation,
among others. The results of the analysis of the sub￾groups in which ALI/ARDS was present or not argue

against a biotrauma hypothesis of MV as a cause in the
development of AKI.
Twenty-three of the selected studies are observational
[11-33], which may result in confounding. To attenuate
this risk, we used a random effects model, analysed diag￾nostic subgroups and performed a separate meta-analysis
of studies analysing MV as a risk factor for AKI in multi￾variate analysis. In three studies [17,22,30], MV was a risk
factor for AKI in univariate analysis, but not in multivari￾ate analysis. This suggests that MV in these studies was
not an independent risk factor. Also the substantial het￾erogeneity in the different meta-analyses suggests that MV
is not the only risk factor for AKI. Arguably, the most
important explanations of the heterogeneity are the differ￾ent underlying aetiologies and differences in the severity of
illness of the included patients, both leading to various a
priori risks of AKI. The heterogeneity was low in some
diagnostic subgroups - cardiac disease, influenza A H1N1,
and sepsis - but high in others, suggesting a clinically sig￾nificant association particularly in former conditions.
Other explanations of the heterogeneity are a varying pre￾admission renal function with different risks for AKI
(Table S2 and S3 in Additional file 1) and the different cri￾teria used to define AKI. With the recent introduction of
the RIFLE and AKIN criteria, a lower threshold was set to
define AKI compared with studies done before the intro￾duction. This is especially true in the analysis of ventilator
settings, in which studies were included with thresholds of
AKI ranging from RIFLE-R to renal replacement therapy
(Table S3 in Additional file 1).
Only one study in our analysis was specifically designed
to examine the relation between different ventilator
settings and the risk for AKI. This post hoc analysis by
Cortjens et al. [41] reported no reduction in the develop￾ment or worsening of AKI comparing low with high Vt
MV, similar to the pooled result of the meta-analysis of Vt.
Neither the meta-analyses of Vt nor PEEP showed evidence
for an effect on the occurrence of AKI. The only study that
showed a lower risk of AKI with higher PEEP and lower Vt
was the one by Ranieri et al. [36]. The difference may be
explained by other risk factors besides MV, for example a
prolonged stay on the ICU: Ranieri et al. excluded all
patients mechanically ventilated longer than eight hours
before randomisation and had a follow-up of 96 hours
after admission. The patients included in the other studies
had already been mechanically ventilated for a longer time
before inclusion or randomisation. They were followed
until MV was stopped, 28 days after admission or until
ICU discharge.
Two well-known studies examining ventilator settings
and reporting on renal function [45,46] were not included
in this meta-analysis - because the numerical values neces￾sary to be analysed in this meta-analysis were not provided
- but are important to discuss here. The ARDS Network
trial [45] reported that patients in the low Vt group had
more renal failure-free days as opposed to those in the high
Vt group (20 ± 11 vs. 18 ± 11 days, P = 0.005). However,
using a subset of the original ARDS Network trial and
defining AKI by an increase of serum creatinine (sCr) 50%
from baseline instead of the cutoff value of ≥2 mg/dl used
in the original study, Parikh et al. showed that the
incidence of AKI in both groups was similar [37]. The
EXPRESS study [46] showed no difference between patients
treated with low or high PEEP in terms of renal failure-free
days when using a cutoff value of ≥3.4 mg/dl for sCr.
We found four studies comparing NIV with invasive
MV [2,42-44]. When pooled together, AKI appears to
develop more often in patients with invasive MV than in
those with NIV (Figure S8 in Additional file 1). However,
no evidence for such an effect is found when the studies
are analysed separately in the diagnostic subgroups
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and mixed.
An estimate of the relative risk of developing AKI when
mechanically ventilated using the data as presented in Fig￾ure 2 is 1.6. We calculated what this risk means for an
ICU with 600 annual admissions, of which 500 receive
MV. In a recent study, the risk of developing AKI in
patients receiving MV was 29 percent [2]. In our example,
163 patients annually admitted will thus develop AKI. A
hypothetical reduction of 20 percent in patients receiving

invasive MV would lead to 11 patients who do not develop
AKI annually. Given an ICU mortality of 50 percent, five
patients will not die from MV-related AKI each year. We
do not advocate reducing the appropriate use of MV, but
we would like to emphasize that this study shows that
besides well-known risk factors for AKI like hypotension,
sepsis, intravenous contrast and antibiotics, MV is an addi￾tional one with clinical consequences.

This study has several limitations. The included studies
were not specifically designed to answer prospectively the
question whether MV has an effect on renal function and,
therefore, a large diversity in studies, study designs, patient
categories with different diagnoses, definitions of renal fail￾ure and severity of illness were combined. In some cases, it
was not possible to extract from the published material
definitively whether AKI was present at the start of MV or
after MV was initiated.
Conclusions
In conclusion, invasive MV is associated with a threefold
increase in odds of AKI in critically ill patients. In general,
Vt or PEEP settings do not seem to modify the risk.
Key messages
• Invasive mechanical ventilation is associated with a
threefold increase in odds of acute kidney injury in cri￾tically ill patients.
• Tidal volume or positive end-expiratory pressure
settings do not seem to modify the risk.
• Acute kidney injury appears to develop more often in
patients with invasive mechanical ventilation than in
those with non-invasive ventilation.
