Abstract
Cardiac morphology and function assessment by magnetic resonance imaging is of increasing interest for a variety of
mouse models in pre-clinical cardiac research, such as myocardial infarction models or myocardial injury/remodeling in
genetically or pharmacologically induced hypertension. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constraints, however, limit image quality
and blood myocardium delineation, which crucially depend on high spatial resolution. Significant gains in SNR with
a cryogenically cooled RF probe have been shown for mouse brain MRI, yet the potential of applying cryogenic RF coils for
cardiac MR (CMR) in mice is, as of yet, untapped. This study examines the feasibility and potential benefits of CMR in mice
employing a 400 MHz cryogenic RF surface coil, compared with a conventional mouse heart coil array operating at room
temperature. The cryogenic RF coil affords SNR gains of 3.0 to 5.0 versus the conventional approach and hence enables an
enhanced spatial resolution. This markedly improved image quality – by better deliniation of myocardial borders and
enhanced depiction of papillary muscles and trabeculae – and facilitated a more accurate cardiac chamber quantification,
due to reduced intraobserver variability. In summary the use of a cryogenically cooled RF probe represents a valuable
means of enhancing the capabilities of CMR of mice.

Introduction
Genetically modified animal models have evolved into prota￾gonists in cardiac research. Alongside the established surgically
and pharmacologically induced animal models, they are valuable
for studying the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Adequate
characterization, rapid phenotyping, assessment of gender effects,
evaluation of novel therapeutics and long-term follow-up studies
are still challenging. To this end there is an ever growing need for
non-invasive in vivo imaging that (i) provides excellent spatial and
temporal resolution (a prerequisite for cardiovascular research), (ii)
has a high reproducibility and (iii) is suitable for longitudinal
studies. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and echocar￾diography are widely used in clinical and preclinical studies, with
CMR being accepted as the more accurate modality. Cardiac
morphology and function assessment is the workhorse of CMR
and is of increasing interest for a variety of mouse models in pre￾clinical cardiac research, such as myocardial infarction models or
myocardial injury/remodeling in genetically or pharmacologically
induced hypertension.
The small size of the mouse heart and its rapid motion with
typical heart rates of 400 to 600 beats per minute pose substantial
challenging demands on CMR in mice. Together with signal-to￾noise ratio (SNR) limitations, these challenges bear the potential to
deteriorate image quality severely. Cardiac morphology and
function assessment requires imaging techniques that provide
excellent delineation of myocardial borders - hence the need for
high ventricular blood to myocardium contrast -, full coverage of
the cardiac cycle with high temporal resolution, but also coverage
of the entire heart with high spatial resolution to facilitate reliable
segmentation of the endo- and epicardial borders.
Realizing these competing constraints assessment of cardiac
morphology, cardiac chamber quantification and cardiac function
assessment require imaging protocols and hardware that are
tailored for CMR. The hardware used in current experimental
CMR of mice affords images with a typical in-plane spatial
resolution of 100–200 mm, heart coverage of 6–13 slices of
1.0 mm thickness and measurement of 10–20 cardiac phases
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]. Although these studies provide acceptable
image quality for the quantitative assessment of the left ventricle
(LV), assessment of the right ventricle (RV) remains challenging
due to the limited image quality of the RV. RV assessment is of
increasing interest since remodelling and myocardial injury are not
restricted to the left ventricle [11] and the RV is a primary target
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 August 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 8 | e42383

of diseases including RV dysfunction or RV hypertrophy as a result
of pulmonary hypertension or RV-thinning in case of dysplasia,
such as arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC)
[12]. For preclinical research of these diseases numerous mouse
models are available, such as pulmonary arterial constriction [13]
(for the RV aspects of pulmonary hypertension) or plakoglobin
deficient mice [14] (for ARVC). For all these reasons it is
conceptually appealing to improve image quality for CMR in
mice. To meet this goal enhancements in the spatial resolution are
essential, which in turn built on SNR improvements.
Strategies for improving SNR are i) signal averaging, which
comes at the expense of prolonged measurement times, ii) moving
to higher magnetic field strengths, which are associated with
practical impediments, such as increased magnetic field inhomo￾geneities and RF power deposition, or iii) perfecting radio
frequency (RF) coil technology, which holds the promise to offer
significant gains in SNR. RF coils tailored for CMR are dedicated
birdcage volume coils or surface coil arrays with the geometry
adjusted to the size of a mice (25–35 mm inner diameter or 15–
26 mm side length respectively) [2,4,5,6,7,8,10]. An emerging RF
coil technology for MRI of small rodents is the cryo-cooling of
RF coils, which reduces the electronic noise. Such cryogenic RF
probes are widely used in vertical NMR spectroscopy systems, but
have only recently become available for horizontal small bore MR
imaging systems. Significant gains in SNR with a cryogenic probe
have been shown for MRI of the mouse brain [15,16,17,18]. The
application of cryogenic RF coils for CMR in mice has, as of yet,
untapped potential. No reports that exploit cryogenic RF coil
technology for CMR in mice have been published yet.
Realizing this opportunity, this study examines the feasibility of
cardiac MRI in mice employing a 400 MHz cryogenic transceive
RF surface coil and demonstrates its suitability for high spatial
resolution functional and structural CMR in mice. Image quality,
SNR, and cardiac function are assessed. For comparison
a conventional mouse heart receive-only coil array operating at
room temperature is used.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the
guidelines provided and approved by the Animal Welfare
Department of the Landesamt fu¨r Gesundheit und Soziales Berlin
(Berlin State Office of Health and Social Affairs, Permit Number:
G0019/12). All imaging experiments were performed under
isoflurane anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize
suffering.
MRI System and Coil Setup
All imaging experiments were carried out on a 9.4T small
animal MR system (Biospec 94/20, Bruker Biospin, Ettlingen,
Germany) operating at 400 MHz. Two RF coil set-ups were used:
a) conventional linear polarized birdcage resonator (Bruker
Biospin, Ettlingen, Germany; inner diameter of 72 mm) for
transmission in conjunction with a curved four channel
receive only mouse cardiac coil array (Bruker Biospin,
Ettlingen, Germany) at room temperature (RT) and
b) a cryogenic transceive quadrature RF surface coil (Cryo￾Probe, CP, Bruker Biospin, Ettlingen, Germany) of similar
coil geometry as the RT surface coil (overlapping coils bent to
a cylinder surface; inner diameter: 20 mm, length: 85 mm)
operating at around 30 K (preamplifiers at 77 K) cooled by
a closed-cycle refrigeration system.
The CryoProbe’s surface (which is in direct contact with the
animal) is equipped with a temperature sensor and can be
temperature regulated using a resistive heater unit (Bruker,
BioSpin AG, Fa¨llanden, Switzerland). This approach was used
to maintain the surface temperature of the Cryoprobe at 37uC.
Animal Preparation
3-month-old C57BL/6N mice were obtained from a commercial
breeder (Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany) and kept under
controlled conditions for temperature, humidity and light, with
chow and water ad libitum. Mice were anesthetized in a warmed
anesthetic chamber using 2.5% isoflurane in an oxygen/air
mixture (2:1) with a flow rate of 750 ml/min for induction and
then maintained at 1.5%. When using the CryoProbe the forepaws
of the mouse were held in a caudal position by adhesive tape in
order to keep the distance between mouse chest and coil elements
as small as possible. The mouse was placed supine on the animal
bed of the CryoProbe, in contrast to the prone position (with
cranial forepaw placement) required for use of the RT-coil.
A body temperature of 37uC was maintained by warming the
animal beds using a circulating heated water system (Thermo
Haake GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) and monitoring by a rectal
temperature probe throughout the measurements. Respiratory
signals were continuously monitored using a commercial moni￾toring and gating system (SA Instruments, Inc., New York, USA)
and kept between 50–70 respiration cycles per minute by
regulating the isoflurane dose. Ten mice were imaged twice, once
with the RT-coil and once with the CryoProbe in an interval of
two weeks. The first and second MRI was performed at the same
time of the day to avoid physiological variations due to circadian
rhythm.
B1 Field of the CryoProbe in vivo
Relative maps of the transmit component of the RF electro￾magnetic field (B1
+
) were calculated from pulse oximetry triggered
FLASH acquisitions (a = 30u/60u, TE/TR = 1.4/5000 ms,
BW = 75 kHz, slice thickness = 2 mm, spatial resolution:
0.2360.7162 mm3 interpolated to 0.1260.2362 mm3
, averages
= 2, partially parallel imaging (PPI) acceleration = 2, acquisition
time per angle = 7 min) of standard short axis and four chamber
views of the mice heart using the double angle method [19,20].
In vivo Coil Comparison
To obtain a stack of cardiac short axis (SAX) views covering the
whole heart, ten slices were consecutively acquired using a self￾gated [4] bright-blood cine fast low angle shot technique
(IntraGate-FLASH, slice thickness = 0.8 mm). For each coil two
imaging protocols were conducted using:
a) conventional spatial resolution protocol (spatial resolution
= 15662346800 mm3
, TE/TR = 1.4/8.5 ms, a = 15u,
BW = 75 kHz, NR = 100, cardiac frames = 20, TA
,2 min) and
b) high spatial resolution protocol (spatial resolution
= 6961156800 mm3
, TE/TR = 1.3/8.5 ms, a = 20u,
BW = 75 kHz, NR = 170, cardiac frames = 20, TA
,4.5 min).
For both protocols the navigator parameters used for motion
tracking and cardiac gating were: FA = 2u, BW = 2740 Hz,
thickness = 2 mm in oblique slice location. The navigator slice
was always aligned with the long axis of the left ventricle and
crossed the apex and the center of the mitral valve. Since
volume resonators and surface coils have different B1
+ efficiency

and characteristics, the RF power adjustment slice (thickness
= 2 mm) was adapted to the respective coil configuration. For
the RT-coil the adjustment slice was positioned in axial
orientation whereas the adjustment slice for the CryoProbe
experiments was placed in the coronal orientation through the
center of the heart.
For SNR comparison between both imaging protocols the mean
SNR of left ventricular myocardium was estimated for a midven￾tricular slice. The high-resolution protocol was used for in-depth
SNR analysis and cardiac function assessment. SNR values were
obtained by determining signal intensities from regions of interest
(ROI) positioned in an end diastolic short axis view on the level of
the papillary muscles using a six segment model [21]. Mean
myocardium SNR values were estimated for all slices covering the
heart from the base to the apex. Noise was given by the standard
deviation of the signal obtained from a ROI placed in the
background (air) anterior to the thorax on the midventricular level.
SNR was estimated by dividing mean signal intensity of the left
ventricular myocardium by the noise. Cardiac function assessment
was performed twice by an experienced observer in a blinded
manner using CMR42 (Circle CVI, Calgary, Canada). For this
purpose endo- and epicardial borders were contoured in end￾systole and end-diastole using a stack of short axis cine views.
Stroke volumes (SV), end-diastolic volumes (EDV), end-systolic
volumes (ESV), ejection fractions (EF), and myocardial masses
(EDM) were calculated for both left and right ventricle.
Intraobserver and interobserver variability for the EDV, ESV
and EDM of the left and right ventricle was evaluated using Bland￾Altman analysis.
To further put the SNR gain inherent to the CryoProbe to use
CINE images were acquired with an exquisite spatial resolution of
(4361386300) mm3 using short axis views (TE/TR = 1.6/
12.5 ms, a = 22u, partial Fourier acceleration = 2, BW = 119 kHz,
NR = 340, cardiac frames = 20, TA ,19 min, called ultra-high
resolution in the following).

-maps of a four chamber view and a short axis view
obtained for the CryoProbe are shown in Figure 1. A linear B1
+
profile was found for a midventricular short axis view. A change in
realtive B1
+ of approximately 65% was observed in the coil
sensitivity profile ranging from the anterior chest wall to the
inferior myocardium. The long axis view revealed a rather
constant B1
+ distribution due to an almost parallel alignment of
the slice with the coils sensitivity profile. B1
+ values in the region of
the myocardium were found to be above 100%.
In vivo Imaging of Mice Heart
Cardiac cine imaging of the mouse heart in the short axis and
four chamber view was feasible for both protocols and coil
configurations. The high-resolution images derived from Cryo￾Probe acquisitions revealed an enhanced anatomical detail and
myocardial border sharpness versus the RT-coil acquisitions as
illustrated in Figures 2 and 3. Figure S1 shows a short axis view
CINE data set of 20 cardiac phases acquired with the CryoProbe.
For the four chamber view (Figure 2), the CP image afforded an
accurate delineation of the left ventricular outflow tract including
the aortic valve and the aortic vessel wall. In comparison,
identifying the closing of the aortic valve in the CINE images
derived from RT acquistions is elusive. For the CP images the
lateral right ventricle blood myocardium border was well defined
especially at the level of the apex. In contrast, subtle anatomic
structures were severly blurred by noise in the RT images: a close
examination of the short axis views (Figure 3) revealed an enhanced
depiction of anatomic details of the left ventricular papillary
muscles and right ventricular trabeculae in the CP images
compared to the RT images, for both diastole and systole.
Coronary arteries were more pronounced in the CP-images. In
particular, the lateral and inferior right endocardial boundary was
better delineated in the CP images. Although the shape of the right
ventricle differed between the prone position (RT coil) and supine
position (CP) (Figures 2+3), the end-diastolic volumes (EDV) or
end-systolic volumes (ESV) did not differ significantly: DEDV
= 22.13611.37 ml, DESV = 3.9864.95 ml.
The SNR assessment showed that SNR derived from the lower
resolved images acquired with the RT coil (SNR = 4769) was
comparable to that obtained from the higher resolved images
acquired with the CryoProbe (SNR = 5467). In contrast, the
SNR of the higher resolved images acquired with the RT coil was
only 1562, and that of the lower resolved images acquired with
the CP was 221616.
Both slicewise and segmented analysis of the mean SNR in the
myocardium demonstrated superior SNR for the CP compared to
the RT coil (Figure 4). The gain in SNR (CP vs RT) ranged from
3.0 to 5.0. Highest SNR gains were observed for the region located
closest to the coil. The SNR gain was less pronounced for regions
more distant to the CP/RT coil. Segmental SNR analysis resulted
in: SNRCP/SNRRT = 3.0, 3.2, 3.7, 4.3, 4.3, 3.2 for segments 1–6.
The slice by slice SNR analysis revealed a minor reduction in the
SNR gain from base to apex for both coils, with the exception of
the apical slice in the CP images, where SNR increased again. For
slices 1–6 a comparable mean SNR gain was observed: SNRCP/
SNRRT = 3.660.1. A peak SNR gain of 5.0 was achieved in the
apical slice.
Bland-Altman analysis of intraobserver comparison for end￾diastolic volumes (EDV), end-systolic volumes (ESV), and end￾diastolic myocardial masses (EDM) for the left and right ventricle
is shown in Figure 5. Standard deviations of the mean differences
for EDV, ESV and masses were found to be smaller using the
CryoProbe for both left and right ventricle. The LV-EDV and
RV-ESV showed the largest impact, followed by the LV-EDM
and the RV-EDM.
The analysis of the interobserver comparison yielded the
following mean differences (6 standard deviations, RT/CP):
LV-EDV 0.061.4 ml/1.661.8 ml, RV-EDV20.962.3 ml/
21.063.1 ml, LV-ESV20.261.3 ml/1.160.6 ml, RV￾ESV21.761.0 ml/21.661.0 ml, LV-EDM 1.663.7 mg/
0.161.8 mg, RV-EDM 0.861.6 mg/0.761.0 mg. Using the
CryoProbe standard deviations were smaller, except for the EDV.
The image quality of the CryoProbe ultra-high spatial
resolution images (Figure 6) was even further enhanced compared
to the high resolution images (Figure 3). Endo- and epicardial
border delineation as well as the depiction of anatomic details of
the papillary muscles and trabeculae were improved.
The partial volume effects for the very thin structure of the RV
were estimated by calculating how many image voxels constitute
the myocardium of the RV (mean volume 18.3 ml): 626, 2879, or
10266 voxels for the conventional, high, or ultra-high resolution
protocols. With the improved spatial resolution afforded by the CP
the RV wall (estimated wall thickness 0.40 mm) was covered by
3.5–5.8 pixels. For comparison, the RV was covered by only 1.7–
2.6 pixels when using the RT coil with the lower resolution
protocol. With the ultra-high spatial resolution protocol the RV
was even covered by 2.9–9.3 pixels, which is beneficial for
reducing partial volume effects.

Discussion
In this study we demonstrated the feasibility of structural and
functional CMR in mice employing a cryogenic RF surface coil.
Image quality in terms of SNR and depiction of anatomic details
was found to be superior using the CP compared to the standard
cardiac four channel room temperature surface coil in conjunction
with the volume resonator. Intraobserver variability improved for
the assessment of cardiac volumes and masses and interobserver
variability for ESV and EDM.
The B1
+ decrease from anterior to inferior in the short axis view
is approximately linear and less pronounced than that reported for
phantom experiments by Baltes et al [16]. This may partially be
due to the use of the double-oblique imaging slices, leading to the
short axis view and four chamber view showing less of a B1
+
-
gradient than one would expect in an axial slice and more than
one would expect in a coronal slice.
B1
+ values in the heart were found to be above 100%. This can
be explained with the fact that the transmitter adjustment slice was
placed in a strictly coronal orientation using a strictly axial
reference image, while the heart orientation is oblique. Another
limitation was that an entire slice was used for transmitter
adjustment rather that a selected volume. Further optimization of
the positioning of the RF-power adjustment slice and ideally
a spatial limitation to a selected volume (through a modification of
the adjustment procedure) might help to reduce this deviance and
to further improve SNR and blood-myocardium contrast.
Nevertheless, the B1 characteristics afforded excellent image
quality and facilitated cardiac chamber quantification.
The observed differences beween the shape of the right ventricle
in the RT coil images and CP images can be explained with the
different positioning of the animal, i.e. in the prone position for the
RT coil and in supine position for the CP. Besides the natural
prone position, also the supine position has been used for CMR
studies of mice (e.g. [5,9,22]). An effect of the positioning on the
functional parameters cannot be ruled out completely, but is
unlikely since the end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes of the RV
did not differ markedly in our study.
The demonstrated SNR improvements for images acquired
with the CryoProbe compared to the RT-coil set-up is consistent
with the published findings for MRI of the brain at the same field
strength of 9.4 Tesla and with similar RF hardware [16]. For
cardiac MRI the achievable SNR gain reported here exceeds that
reported for brain (heart: 3.0 to 5.0, brain: 2.2 to 3.0). One
possible reason for the differences in SNR gain in the present study
is a different performance of the room-temperature coil that was
used as reference. However differences in the CryoProbes cannot
be excluded, notwithstanding same design.
The spatial variation in SNR across the myocardial segments of
a short axis view can be explained with the proximity to the
surface coil. A decrease in signal-amplitude with increasing
distance is inherent to surface coils. Here, the surface coil
characteristics explain that the region closest to the coil showed
the highest SNR, and SNR clearly decreased with the distance
from the coil.
A trend towards a SNR reduction along the base to apex line
was observed, with the exception of the apical slice (CP only). The
unexpected higher SNR at the apical slice observed for the
CryoProbe was not found for the RT images. Hence partial
volume effects, i.e. blood contaminations, can be excluded as
a reason for this SNR increase. Moreover, the same SNR increase
in slice 7 was found also for a region of interest in the skeletal
muscle (located within the slice). This phenomenon is therefore not
likely to have physiological causes, but conceivably may be caused
by the two-element surface coil characteristics.

outflow tract including aortic vessel wall, as well as the lateral right ventricle blood myocardium border especially at the level of the apex.

The achieved gain in SNR by use of the CryoProbe facilitated
higher spatial resolution CMR, while maintaining an SNR
comparable to the lower resolution RT-coil images. While the
high resolution protocol also yielded a better depiction of
anatomical details in RT-coil images when compared with the
respective lower resolved images, this came at the cost of
significantly reduced SNR and poorer delineation of myocardial
boundaries, particularly for the RV. The subjective criteria of

enhanced image quality evident in the high resolution CP images
was underpinned objectively by the results of the quantitative
assessment of cardiac function and morphology. These encourag￾ing results further support our subjective impression of excellent
image quality in the high-resolution CryoProbe images and
suggest that CMR-based assessment of cardiac function and
morphology in mice for both left and right ventricle could benefit
from the use of a cryogencally cooled RF coil.Furthermore, the
high SNR of the CryoProbe allowed for pushing the limits of
spatial resolution for in-vivo CMR of mice using a horizontal bore
MR system even further to 4361386300 mm, resulting in superb
delineation of endo- and epicardial borders, papillary muscles and
trabeculae. Images of this quality for some selected slices of
particular interest could complement whole heart coverage by
means of the high resolution protocol. This work demonstrates the
SNR benefits of the CryoProbe approach in healthy mice. This
mandatory precursor was essential before extra variances due to
gender and/or pathophysiological conditions are introduced. It is
to be expected that the SNR gain shown here will not be altered
significantly when moving towards pathological conditions. Re￾alizing this opportunity we anticipate to put the proposed high
spatial resolution CryoProbe approach to use for rapid character￾ization and phenotyping of mouse models of cardiovascular
diseases.
In conclusion, cardiac morphology, cardiac chamber quantifi￾cation and cardiac function assessement using a cryogenically
cooled RF probe is feasible and affords SNR gains in the range of
3.0 to 5.0 compared to a conventional room temperature cardiac
RF coil set-up. This SNR gain could potentially be invested in
shortening the acquisition time. Yet, more relevant to CMR, the
increased SNR enables a higher spatial resolution. This appears to
facilitate a more accurate quantitative analysis, due to reduced
intraobserver variability. In summary, the use of a cryogenically
cooled RF probe represents a valuable means of enhancing the
image quality in CMR of mice. This improvement holds the
promise to be beneficial for cardiac MR research explorations into
a variety of mouse models of cardiovascular diseases including the
characterization of progression and regression of hypertension
induced myocardial hypertrophy and identification of sex specific
effects of cardiac damage and cardiac (dys) function.
