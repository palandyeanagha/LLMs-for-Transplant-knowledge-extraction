Abstract. Objectives: This study aims to investigate, retrospectively, the epidemiological and 
clinical characteristics, laboratory results, radiologic findings, and outcomes of COVID-19 in 
patients with transfusion-dependent β thalassemia major (TM), β-thalassemia intermedia (TI) 
and sickle cell disease (SCD). 
Design: A total of 17 Centers, from 10 countries, following 9,499 patients with 
hemoglobinopathies, participated in the survey. 
Main outcome data: Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic findings and outcomes of patients with 
COVID-19 were collected from medical records and summarized. 
Results: A total of 13 patients, 7 with TM, 3 with TI, and 3 with SCD, with confirmed COVID-19, 
were identified in 6 Centers from different countries. The overall mean age of patients was 
33.7±12.3 years (range:13-66); 9/13 (69.2%) patients were females. Six patients had pneumonia, 
and 4 needed oxygen therapy. Increased C-reactive protein (6/10), high serum lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH; 6/10), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR; 6/10) were the most 
common laboratory findings. 6/10 patients had an exacerbation of anemia (2 with SCD). In the 
majority of patients, the course of COVID-19 was moderate (6/10) and severe in 3/10 patients. A
30-year-old female with TM, developed a critical SARS-CoV-2 infection, followed by death in an 
Intensive Care Unit. In one Center (Oman), the majority of suspected cases were observed in 
patients with SCD between the age of 21 and 40 years. A rapid clinical improvement of 
tachypnea/dyspnea and oxygen saturation was observed, after red blood cell exchange
transfusion, in a young girl with SCD and worsening of anemia (Hb level from 9.2 g/dl to 6.1g/dl).
Conclusions: The data presented in this survey permit an early assessment of the clinical 
characteristics of COVID 19 in different countries. 70% of symptomatic patients with COVID￾19 required hospitalization. The presence of associated co-morbidities can aggravate the severity 
of COVID- 19, leading to a poorer prognosis irrespective of age.

Introduction. The recent COVID-19 outbreak has 
been deemed a global health emergency. From Dec 31, 
2019, to May 20, 2020, 4,861,456 cases of COVID-19 
(in accordance with the applied case definitions and 
testing strategies in the affected countries), and 
322,483 deaths were reported
(https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical￾distribution-2019-ncov-cases). 
The clinical presentation of COVID-19 disease is 
quite variable.1,2 A study from the Chinese Center for 
Disease Control and Prevention on 72,314 patients 
with COVID-19 (44,672 laboratory-confirmed, 16,186 
suspected, and 10,567 clinically diagnosed), reported 
that the clinical severity was mild in 81.4%, severe in 
13.9%, and critical in 4.7%. Most patients were 
between 30 to 79 years of age (87%), 1% were less 
than 9 years, 1% between 10 and 19 years and 3% 
were 80 and above years.3 
Subjects at higher risk for severe illness are: adults 
> 60 years, patients with chronic diseases [heart, lungs, 
and end-stage renal disease neuromuscular disorders, 
sickle cell disease (SCD), cirrhosis and diabetes], 

 www.mjhid.org Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis 2020; 12; e2020046 Pag. 3 / 9
immunocompromised patients, pregnant women or 
those immediately postpartum (<2 weeks), and patients 
who reside in nursing homes or long-term care 
facilities (https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/wp 
content/uploads/ sites; Updated:11 April 2020). 
In subjects with SCD, this is probably due to 
impaired immunity resulting from impaired function of 
the spleen, systemic vasculopathy that predisposes to 
end-organ dysfunction, and an increased risk of 
thrombosis. Patients with thalassemias could have 
multiple organ impairment due to iron overload and 
chronic anemia (chronic hypoxemia) of the heart, lungs 
(pulmonary artery hypertension), liver and endocrine 
glands. Both groups of patients have been considered 
vulnerable to COVID-19 and at potentially higher risk 
for severe complications compared to the general 
young population (especially in the older age group).
4 
Moreover, coexistent immune system impairment in 
patients with thalassemia also predisposes to more 
severe COVID-19 disease.4 However, there is limited 
information available on COVID-19 infection in
patients with hemoglobinopathies.4-9
We report the preliminary results of an International 
Multicentre Study (IMS), promoted by the 
International Network of Clinicians for 
Endocrinopathies in Thalassemia and Adolescence 
Medicine (ICET-A). The survey aimed to investigate 
the COVID-19 retrospectively in patients with 
hemoglobinopathies, namely β-thalassemias (TM and 
TI) and SCD, followed in 17 Centers from 10 
countries.
Survey Design and Participants
Questionnaire development. A. First step
In April 2020, the Coordinator of the ICET-A 
(VDS) with DC and JLVC designed and promoted a 
survey questionnaire to collect, as a primary aim, data 
on confirmed COVID-19 in patients with 
hemoglobinopathies and as a secondary aim, the 
numbers of suspected or probable COVID-19 cases,
10
without performing the test, registered from Jan 1, 
2020, to 7th June 2020. 
For a uniform collection of data, the diagnosis of β￾thalassemias was based on the definitions proposed by 
Kattamis et al.11 in TM patients, Karimi et al.
12 in TI 
cases, and by Quinn13 for the diagnosis of SCD.
Before the distribution to the ICET-A members, the 
questionnaire was revised and discussed with the 
ICET-A Board (SD, CK, and MK).
A. Second step. The final questionnaire was sent by 
mail to 12 Thalassemia Centers of the ICET-A 
Network. 
Each ICET-A member was free to distribute the 
questionnaire to other Thalassemia Centers within their 
own country. The deadline for returning the requested 
data was fixed to 7th June 2020. 
Definitions of confirmed COVID-19 and close contact. 
A patient was classified as confirmed COVID-19 in the 
presence of laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 
infection, documented by at least one nasal/pharyngeal 
swab specimen positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid 
testing (NAT) using reverse-transcriptase polymerase￾chain-reaction (RT-PCR) technology,14 irrespective of 
clinical signs and symptoms, according to the 
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control as 
of Mar 2, 2020. Close contact definition was based on 
the current WHO available information.10
Data collection. The collected data included: 
demographic data, medical history, exposure history, 
underlying comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory 
findings, chest X-ray and/or computed tomography 
(CT) scans, treatment schedules, and outcomes. The 
disease onset was defined as the day when the first 
symptoms appeared before the first medical 
contact/examination. Time (in days) from the onset of 
disease to hospital discharge was also recorded. 
Laboratory data included: complete blood cell count 
(CBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate (ESR), liver enzymes and serum 
creatinine, D-dimer, levels of procalcitonin, serum 
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and serum ferritin levels. 
Clinical and diagnostic classification. Patients with a 
nasal/pharyngeal swab specimen positive for SARS￾CoV-2, fever, respiratory symptoms, and radiologic 
changes consistent with diffuse pneumonitis were 
defined as having pneumonic COVID-19. Positive 
patients, with fever and respiratory symptoms without 
radiologic changes, were defined as having non￾pneumonic COVID-19. Positive patients, without fever 
and respiratory symptoms, were defined as 
asymptomatic. Furthermore, according to the latest 
recommendations of the National Health Commission 
of the People's Republic of China14 and WHO,10
COVID-19 disease was classified into four types: mild, 
moderate, severe and critical. Type 1 mild: mild 
clinical symptoms without pneumonia at chest 
computed tomography; Type 2 moderate: fever and 
other respiratory symptoms with pneumonia seen at 
imaging; Type 3 severe: respiratory distress (≥ 30 
breaths per min), hypoxia (oxygen saturation: ≤ 93%), 
or abnormal results of blood gas analysis; and type 4 
critical: respiratory failure requiring mechanical 
ventilation, shock, or other organ(s) failure requiring 
intensive care unit monitoring and treatment.
Study approval. Ethical approval and informed patient 
or guardian consent were obtained in accordance with 
local institutional requirements and with Good Clinical 
Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki principles for 
ethical research, and its later amendments.

Data presentation. Descriptive statistics of the 
participants' baseline characteristics are provided as 
mean and standard deviation (SD) for continuous 
variables and frequency and percentages for categorical 
variables. A detailed description of confirmed COVID￾19 patients is also provided.
Results. A total of 17 Centers, 5 from Turkey, 3 from 
Italy, 2 from Bulgaria, and 1 each from Azerbaijan,
Cyprus, Greece, India, Iran, Oman, and Qatar, 
following 9,499 patients with hemoglobinopathies (β￾thalassemias and SCD), participated in the survey. The 
distribution by age groups, sex, and type of 
hemoglobinopathy are listed in table 1. The largest 
group of patients with TM and TI was reported in 
Azerbaijan (TM:1,304; TI:605) and for SCD in Oman 
(SCD: 2,000).
A total of 13 patients with confirmed COVID-19 by 
RT-PCR, 7 with TM, 3 with TI, and 3 with SCD, were 
retrospectively identified from 6 Centers (Azerbaijan, 
Cyprus, Iran, Italy, Turkey, and Oman) (Table 2). The 
overall mean age of patients was 33.7±12.3 years 
(range:13-66); 9 (69.2%) were females. 
The general characteristics of patients with 
thalassemias, SCD, and confirmed COVID- 19 are 
reported in table 3. None of them were overweight. 
The mean serum ferritin level in 12/13 patients was 
1,428±1,538 ng/ml. Four patients with thalassemia had 
been splenectomised; 4 had endocrine complications: 3 
had insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (2 with TM 
and in 1 with TI), and one hypogonadal female patient 
had a history of renal disease with hypertension. One 
patient had arrhythmia (Table 2).
Three asymptomatic patients had laboratory￾confirmed positive results for SARS-CoV-2 (based on 
nucleic acid testing of pharyngeal swab samples). All 
had had close contact with an infected family member 
or community exposure. These patients remained 
asymptomatic throughout quarantine and clinical 
monitoring. 
In symptomatic patients, the mean interval between 
symptoms onset and first medical evaluation was 5.0 ± 
3.4 days (range: 3–14).
Fever was present in 8 out of 10 (80%) symptomatic 
patients (peak 38.1°C-39.5°C). Other common signs 
and symptoms were: cough (70%), headache (60%), 
fatigue (60%), gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea 
/vomiting/abdominal pain; 50%), tachypnea/dyspnea 
(40%), sore throat (40%), anosmia/hyposmia (40%), 
conjunctivitis (30%), rhinorrhea (20%) and myalgia 
(10%). Back and chest pain were reported in a patient
with SCD. Six patients had pneumonia (unilateral in 3,

bilateral in 2, and multiple opacities in 1 patient), and 
four needed oxygen therapy, and four patients (2 with 
SCD) had non-pneumonic COVID-19. 
In the majority of patients (6), the course of 
COVID-19 was defined as moderate, and severe in 3. 
Oxygen saturation of ≤ 93% was documented in 3 
patients. One of them, a 30-year-old female with TM 
developed critical type 4 COVID-19, according to the 
National Health Commission of the People's Republic 
of China14 and WHO,
10 characterized by progressive 
respiratory and renal insufficiency, followed by death 
in an Intensive Care Unit.
Increased C-reactive protein (6/10), high LDH 
(6/10), high ESR (6/10), and high D-dimers, in 4 out of 
5 tested patients, were the most common laboratory 
findings. Six patients with confirmed COVID-19 (1 
with SCD) had a reduction of hemoglobin levels, three 
patients had lymphopenia (low absolute number of 
lymphocytes), and 1 SCD patient had 
thrombocytopenia.
Experimental treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 
including hydroxychloroquine (2.5 mg/kg twice daily; 
2 patients), azithromycin (10 mg/kg once 
daily)/clarithromycin (7.5 mg/kg twice daily) or 
moxifloxacin (3 patients), were given to 5 of 6 patients 
with TM. Low molecular weight heparin and antiviral 
drugs (2 and 1 out of 10 patients, respectively) were 
less commonly used. A rapid clinical improvement of 
tachypnea/dyspnea and oxygen saturation was 
observed, after red blood cell exchange transfusion, in 
a 13-year-old girl with SCD and COVID-19. At 
hospital admission, she presented with high fever, 
cough, worsening of anemia (decreased Hb level from 
9.2 g/dl to 6.1g/dl) and elevated D-Dimers).
None of the SCD patients received 
hydroxychloroquine or convalescence plasma 
transfusion.
The average time from the onset of disease to 
hospital discharge was 12.8 ±5.4 days.
Seven Centers did not report cases of suspected or 
probable COVID-19, and 5 Centers did not respond 
with the requested information. One Center reported 
detailed information (data are presented in Table 4). 
The majority of cases were observed in patients with 
SCD, between 21- 40 years (5.5%).

SARS-CoV-19 infection range from asymptomatic to 
severe pneumonia and respiratory failure. Severe 
disease can lead to death. Hospitalization rates are 
higher for people of advanced age (> 60 years). 
Although age and comorbidities have been described as 
the main determinants of disease progression towards 
severe respiratory distress, the high diversity in clinical 
severity among patients could suggest a possible role 
of the host genetic background contributing to the 
observed inter-individual clinical variability associated 
with COVID-19 in black and ethnic minority people.
Up to 7th June 2020, the impact of COVID-19 in 
thalassaemic or SCD patients had only been 
preliminarily evaluated in different countries.3-9,15 
A study of a small cohort of patients with 
thalassemia from Northern Italy, which was the 
epicenter for coronavirus COVID-19 in Europe, 
showed relatively mild to moderate COVID-19 disease 
in 11 patients (10 with TM and 1 with TI) compared to 
the general population with all infected thalassemia 
patients recovered.9 The mean age of this cohort of the 
thalassemic patients was 44 ± 11 years (range 31-61 
years), and 55% (6/11) were females. One patient, with
severe symptoms, required ventilation with continuous
positive airway pressure (CPAP). All patients had 
associated comorbidities, and 70% were 
splenectomised. The likely source of infection was 
found in 64% of cases, while the clinical course ranged 
from 10 to 29 days.9
A multicenter, retrospective, cross-sectional study 
was obtained across all comprehensive thalassemia 
centers in Iran, from January to Apr 29, 2020. All 
suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases from a total 
of 15,950 TM and 2,400 TI patients were evaluated 
Fifteen confirmed cases (12 TM and 3 TI; mean age 
36.1 ± 12.1; range 22-66 years). Moreover, eight 
symptomatic suspected β-thalassemia patients (6 TM 
and 2 TI) of COVID-19 were detected. Seventeen 
patients (73.9%) had mild to moderate symptoms and 
recovered, while six patients died (26.1%, 2 TM, and 4 
TI). More than 60% of all patients had at least one 
comorbidity, and 80% were splenectomised. The 
prevalence of COVID-19 in thalassemia patients was
less than the general population, but the mortality rate
was significantly higher, also taking into consideration 
the lower age.15 Therefore, these findings provide 
further objective evidence to take into account the 
comprehensive risk assessment and prognosis among 
thalassemic patients with COVID-19.
The clinicopathological features, management, and 
outcomes of 10 SCD patients (8 male and 2 female), 
with COVID-19 infection (6 with confirmed COVID￾19 and 4 with suggestive clinical, laboratory and 
radiological features, but a negative swab) with a mean 
age of 36 years, were reported by McCloskey et al. 5 A 
57-year-old patient with several pre-existing 
comorbidities including severe neurological 
impairment as a result of a previous stroke, died. 
Another patient with chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
stage III developed significant deterioration of renal 
function and required temporary peritoneal dialysis, but 
otherwise had a full recovery, as did the remaining 
patients.5
 
To our knowledge, this is the first preliminary 
multicenter study evaluating the COVID-19 in patients 
with hemoglobinopathies, namely β-thalassemias and 
SCD. Approximately 90% of COVID-19 cases are 
associated with household or community exposure, and 
10% are associated with travel.1,2 In the present survey 
the likely source of infection was detected in only 5/13 
(38.4%) of patients. 
A recent review of data from 59,254 patients from 
11 countries has shown a positive association between 
male sex and a higher mortality rate.16 Although adult 

 www.mjhid.org Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis 2020; 12; e2020046 Pag. 7 / 9
men are more susceptible to COVID-19 infection and 
adult females produce more robust inflammatory 
responses as compared to men,17 10 out of 13 of 
patients (76.9%) in our survey were females. Therefore, 
further studies are needed to elucidate this particular 
gender aspect of COVID-19 in hemoglobinopathies. 
Asymptomatic infection at the time of laboratory 
confirmation has been reported in many settings.18,19 
Some of these cases developed symptoms at a later 
stage of infection; the proportion of these cases has not 
yet thoroughly evaluated.20 There are also reports of 
patients remaining asymptomatic throughout 
quarantine, as observed in our patients.
Four of our patients (2 with SCD) had non￾pneumonic COVID-19, 6 had pneumonic COVID-19, 
and five patients, in addition to fever and cough, had 
gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea, vomiting 
and/or abdominal pain.
In the majority of patients (90%) worldwide, the 
outcome of COVID-19 infection has been defined as a 
mild or moderate disease, but severe, and especially 
critical cases are accompanied by a high mortality rate.
Current knowledge has shown that the mortality rate is 
high in people with chronic underlying diseases.21,22
Blood groups were known in 12 of our 13 
confirmed COVID-19 patients: 5 were blood group A 
(41.6%), 33.3% blood group B, 16.6% blood group 0, 
and 8.3% blood group AB. Therefore, it is plausible 
that different blood groups might vary in their 
susceptibility to COVID-19, as reported by Zhao et
al.23 However, more evidence is needed to confirm this 
observation, taking into consideration the specific 
distribution of blood groups among populations. 
Furthermore, in patients with hemoglobinopathies, 
several factors may be associated directly or indirectly 
with the triggering of a severe outcome of the COVID￾19.3-6 Both intravascular and extravascular hemolysis 
can occur in thalassemia patients. Clinicians should, 
therefore, closely monitor blood counts of thalassemia 
patients with COVID-19, and caution should be 
maintained towards the possibility of exacerbated 
hemolytic anemia in the setting of acute viral infection. 
Moreover, there is a significant concern that the 
overlap of lung disease from COVID-19 with acute 
chest syndrome (ACS) may result in increased 
complications among individuals with SCD. 24
Splenectomy is a common therapeutic intervention 
in β-thalassemias, while many SCD patients have a 
hypo-functional spleen. Splenectomy was reported in 
6/13 of our patients with thalassemias. 
Based on the knowledge of the immunological 
functions of the spleen, there is no evidence that 
asplenic/hyposplenic patients are at higher risk of 
having severe COVID-19 infection. 
Nevertheless, since fever could indicate bacterial as 
well as viral infection, all patients should be instructed 
to seek medical advice by contacting their clinical team 
if they develop fever. Medical consideration should be 
given to the presence of superimposed infection, 
particularly with encapsulated pathogens.25,26
In patients with SCD, hypoxia, dehydration, or 
acidosis due to respiratory infection may trigger a 
vaso-occlusive and hemolytic crisis and acute chest 
syndrome (ACS), with a high risk of thrombosis in 
pulmonary arteries.27 Thus, measures to prevent and 
treat ACS early in the event of viral infection, require 
particular alertness by physicians treating infected 
patients.28
Another relevant aspect for COVID-19 infection in 
hemoglobinopathies, mainly SCD and TI, relates to 
current therapy with hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea), 
a cytotoxic agent, with possible immune-compromising 
effects contributing to an adverse outcome of these 
patients.28 Risk stratification recommendations for 
children and adults hospitalized with COVID are 
available from the American Society of Hematology 
(https://hematology.org/covid-19/covid-19-and-vte￾anticoagulation).
The current study has some limitations. First, only 
13 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection were 
identified. However, the data presented in this study 
permit an early assessment of the clinical 
characteristics of COVID-19 in different countries. 
Second, though the sample of patients with COVID-19 
was small, we observed a prevalence of females versus 
males. These data contrast with the reduced 
susceptibility of females, probably linked to the X 
chromosome and sex hormones, which play an 
important role in innate and adaptive immunity.29 
Nevertheless, this is a preliminary report of a rapidly 
evolving condition, as the parameters discussed here 
are changing quickly with time. Third, our survey 
included mainly young adult patients with an age range 
between 20 and 40 years. Lastly, the number of 
reported COVID-19 cases has certainly underestimated 
the real burden of disease, given the widespread 
unavailability and accuracy of tests, and also the 
significant proportion of infected persons, who develop 
asymptomatic or mild unidentified forms of the disease, 
remain undiagnosed. The high number of suspected or 
probable COVID-19 in patients with SCD sustain this 
hypothesis. Therefore, we should be careful when 
measuring the prevalence of confirmed COVID-19, 
acknowledging that the rate will be likely higher once 
the denominator is adjusted to the correct number of 
individuals who acquired the infection. 
Conclusions. It is reasonable to say that few cases of 
COVID-19 have so far been reported in thalassemias 
and SCD patients in the literature. Is this due to a lack 
of testing or a real lack of infection/susceptibility? In 
our survey, a total of only 13 patients with confirmed 
COVID-19 were identified in 17 Centers, from 10 
countries, following 9,499 patients with 

 www.mjhid.org Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis 2020; 12; e2020046 Pag. 8 / 9
hemoglobinopathies. However, our provisional data 
should be interpreted cautiously because only 20% of 
patients with thalassemias and 8.7% of SCD patients 
were in the higher age group (> 40 years) for SARS￾CoV-2 infection. Despite their age, 70% of 
symptomatic COVID-19 patients required 
hospitalization, and the clinical outcome in one patient 
confirmed that associated comorbidities could 
aggravate the severity of infection, leading to death. 
Automated exchange transfusion improved the 
outcome of COVID-19 respiratory failure in a young 
girl with SCD. In the forthcoming weeks, we will 
continue to monitor the epidemiology of the COVID￾19 outbreak collecting data from the participating 
Centers. Any further international participation is 
welcomed.
