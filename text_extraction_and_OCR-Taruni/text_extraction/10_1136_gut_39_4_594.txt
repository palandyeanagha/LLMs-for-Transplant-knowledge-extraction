Abstract
Background-The diagnosis of primary
sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) requires in￾vasive procedures such as liver biopsy and
endoscopic retrograde cholangiography
(ERC). Sonographic measurement of
fasting gall bladder volume, which has
been reported to be enlarged in PSC,
could serve as a non-invasive screening
test.
Methods-Fasting gall bladder volume
was studied in patients with PSC (n=24),
primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC, n=13),
liver cirrhosis due to other causes (n=18),
ulcerative colitis (n=15), and healthy con￾trols (n=23). Meal induced gall bladder
emptying was studied in patients with
PSC, patients with PBC, and healthy
controls.
Results-In patients with PSC gall
bladder volume was greatly enlarged (72.9
(SEM 3.7) ml) compared with healthy
controls (25.4 (1.7) ml, and patients with
PBC (30.9 (2.7) ml), liver cirrhosis (31.3
(4.0) ml) or ulcerative colitis (25.8 (2.0)
ml) (p<00005 v all). In four patients with
PSC the gall bladder wall was irregularly
thickened (>4 mm) as previously de￾scribed in PSC. Postprandial residual
fractions (% of fasting volume) were com￾parable between patients with PSC (17.5
(3.7)%) and those with PBC (23.6 (7.1%)
and healthy controls (12.7 (2.3)%)
Although gall bladder emptying seems
normal, increased biliary pressure in
patients with PSC cannot be excluded.
Conclusion-Apart from wall thickening,
patients with PSC often present with en￾largement of the gall bladder. Sono￾graphic determination of fasting gail
bladder volume may be a useful, non￾invasive, and easy to perform tool in the
evaluation of patients suspected of having
PSC.

Keywords: gall bladder, primary sclerosing cholangitis,

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare
chronic liver disease of unknown aetiology,
characterised by fibrosing strictures of the
intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts and
progressive liver dysfunction. In 70% of cases
the disease is associated with ulcerative colitis
and, less often, with Crohn's disease. The
diagnosis is based on typical histological
findings (onion skin lesions) in liver tissue and
the typical beading appearance of the biliary
tree on endoscopic retrograde cholangiography
(ERC). Most early stage patients are asympto￾matic and present only with raised liver
enzymes during routine blood tests.1 The
prevailing reluctance to perform a liver biopsy
and ERC in asymptomatic patients is under￾standable in view of the morbidity and
mortality from these procedures.2 3 Therefore,
the diagnosis of PSC is often suspected without
being confirmed. Recently, it has been shown
that the hydrophilic bile salt ursodeoxycholic
acid (UDCA) has beneficial effects on clinical,
biochemical, and histological parameters of
PSC.`6 In primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC),
another cholestatic liver disease, progression is
slowed and the need for liver transplantation is
reduced in patients treated with UDCA.7
These promising results suggest that early
treatment, requiring an early diagnosis, is
important. In this regard, a non-invasive
method to detect patients at risk for PSC,
especially among patients with ulcerative colitis
of whom about 5% develop PSC, would be of
considerable value.
In a preliminary study, we reported that the
fasting gall bladder volume is enlarged in
patients with PSC.8 Although a few studies
have reported on gall bladder and cystic duct
involvement in PSC, gall bladder enlargement
has never been described.9'-3 Wondering
whether sonographic measurement of gall
bladder volume could serve as a non-invasive
screening test for PSC, we examined gall
bladder volume in patients with PSC. Healthy
persons, patients with PBC, patients with liver
cirrhosis due to other causes, and patients with
ulcerative colitis with normal liver bio￾chemistry were studied as controls. In
addition, gall bladder emptying in response to
a meal was studied in patients with PSC or
PBC and healthy controls.
Methods
Fasting gall bladder volume was measured in
24 patients with PSC (median age 37, range
18-49 years; men:women 17:7, body mass
index (BMI) 23-9 (SD 0.6)). Sixteen patients
(67%) had concomitant inflammatory bowel
disease (14 ulcerative colitis, two Crohn's
disease). Bile duct lesions were found both
proximal and distal to the cystic duct in 14
(58%) patients whereas only proximal lesions
were found in seven (29%) patients on ERC.
In three patients attempts to perform ERC
were unsuccessful. Liver biopsies were per￾formed in all patients and were compatible
with PSC in all. All patients had biochemical

jaundice during the study (Table). According
to Ludwig et al 19 patients (79%) had early
stage disease (stage I or II), five patients (21%)
had late stage disease (stage III, n=3; stage IV,
n=2).' Only one patient had portal hyper￾tension (varices and splenomegaly). Twenty
three healthy subjects (median age 31, range
24-57 years; men:women 17:6, BMI 22.4 (SD
0.5) were studied as controls. Also studied
were 15 patients with ulcerative colitis with
normal liver biochemistry (ulcerative colitis
controls, median age 35, range 22-57 years;
men:women 10:5, BMI 24 (SD 0.6), 13
patients with PBC (median age 50, range
37-71 years; men:women 4:9, BMI 25.9 (SD
1.1); all with positive antimitochondrial anti￾bodies) including two patients with cirrhosis
and portal hypertension and 18 patients
(median age 52, range 26-70 years;
men:women 9:9, BMI 24.1 (SD 0.7) with liver
cirrhosis of other aetiology (alcohol misuse,
n=4; autoimmune hepatitis, n=3; hepatitis B,
n=2; hepatitis C, n=6; cryptogenic, n=3). Nine
(50%) patients with liver cirrhosis had signs of
portal hypertension (ascites or varices). Liver
biochemistry was comparable between patients
with PSC and those with PBC; however, in the
group of patients with liver cirrhosis of differ￾ent aetiology some had normal liver enzymes
(Table). None of the patients with PSC and
ulcerative colitis control patients had active
colitis at the time of the study. Patients with
PSC were matched with ulcerative colitis
control patients regarding the extent of the
colitis. Colectomised patients were excluded.
One ulcerative colitis control and two patients
with PBC proved to have gall stones. No other
disease controls and none of the healthy
subjects or patients with PSC had gall stones.
Since gall bladder volume can be increased
during UDCA'4 and decreased during choles￾tyramine'5 treatment, these drugs were inter￾rupted at least one month before the study. In
a separate study we found only trace amounts
of UDCA (<2% of total bile salts) in duodenal
bile samples one month after interrupting
UDCA treatment in five patients with PSC
participating in a dose finding study (un￾published data).
Measurement of gall bladder volume was
performed in the morning after an overnight
fast. Subcostal sonographic images were ob￾tained in a supine position (Scanner 250, 3.5/5

ute intervals the maximum longitudinal and
transversal (height and width) dimensions were
measured three times and the longitudinal
perimeter of the gall bladder encircled with a
caliper. The volume of the gall bladder was
calculated with built in software according to
the sum of cylinders method.'6 Fasting gall
bladder volume was the mean of these three
measurements. The sum of cylinders method
estimates gall bladder volume more accurately
than the ellipsoid'7 and area-length methods'8
and has recently been validated in vivo.'9
Postprandial gall bladder emptying was
determined in patients with PSC (except those
with thickening (>0 4 mm) of the gall bladder
wall), patients with PBC, and healthy controls
after ingestion of a mixed meal (2815 kJ, 35 g
fat) containing an egg, one slice of bread with
cheese, sweetened yogurt, and a cup of tea.
Subsequently, gall bladder volume was
measured every 10 minutes during two hours.
The smallest postprandial volume was con￾sidered to be the residual volume.
The protocol was approved by the ethics
committee of the University Hospital Utrecht
where all examinations were performed.
Informed consent was obtained from each
patient.
DATA ANALYSIS
Data are presented as means (SEM). For data
not normally distributed, median and range are
given and log transformation was used.
Statistical analysis of fasting and residual gall
bladder volumes was performed by analysis of
variance (ANOVA) and confirmed with
Fisher's least significance difference test;
p<005 was considered significant. Multiple
regression analysis was used to compare fasting
gall bladder volumes with biochemical
variables.
Results
FASTING GALL BLADDER VOLUME
Fasting gall bladder volume in patients with
PSC was enlarged more than twofold (72.9
(13.7) ml, median 55.6 ml, range 15-4-324-7
ml) compared with healthy controls (25.4 (1 7)
ml), patients with PBC (30.9 (2.7) ml), liver
cirrhosis controls (31.3 (4.0) ml), and ulcer￾ative colitis controls (25-8 (2.0) ml)
(p<00005, PSC v all; Figs 1 and 2). In four
patients with PSC (16.7%, all early stage) the
gall bladder wall seemed to be irregularly
thickened (>4 mm) as previously described in
patients with PSC.13 In this subgroup of
patients, gall bladder volume was in the normal
range (22-0 (3.3) ml). Liver cirrhosis controls
with portal hypertension tended to have a
smaller gall bladder volume (27-6 (4.6) ml)
than those without portal hypertension (35-8
(6.8) ml, NS).
No significant difference was found in gall
bladder volume of patients with (70-2 (12-9)
ml, median 56.4 ml, range 22-9-202-0 ml) and
without (87.5 (40 1) ml, median 58.8 ml,
range 25.5-324.7 ml) bile duct strictures

distally from the cystic duct. In one patient
with a dominant stricture of the common bile
duct, gall bladder volume was 108.0 ml before
and 106o1 ml two days after placement of an
endoprosthesis .
In patients with late stage disease, gall
bladder volume tended to be larger than in
patients with early stage disease (100o7 (25c8)
ml65Cv 5 (15c8) ml, p=0 08). No difference
was found between gall bladder volume of
patients with (73 0 (18a1) ml) and without
(72.6 (21.0) ml) inflammatory bowel disease.
No relation was found between fasting gall
bladder volume and biochemical disturbances
of liver enzymes (data not shown).
The upper limit of fasting gall bladder
volume in our entire control population
(healthy plus disease controls), calculated by
taking the mean +2 SD of all control subjects
(n=69), was 51 ml. A fasting gall bladder
volume >51 ml was found in 13 of 24 patients
with PSC (five of five with late and eight of 19
with early stage disease), one of 13 PBC, three
of 18 controls with liver cirrhosis, 0 of 15
ulcerative colitis controls, and one of 23
healthy controls. As this study was not con￾ducted prospectively, reliable figures on
sensitivity and specificity of gall bladder
enlargement cannot be provided. However, it
is clear from our data that the finding of a large
gall bladder (>50 ml) is common in patients
with PSC (>50%), rare in controls with other
liver diseases, and exceptional in healthy
controls and patients with ulcerative colitis.

gall bladder in patients with PSC cannot be
derived from our data. The gall bladder
volume tended to be larger in patients with late

the size of the the cystic duct as in the case of an impacted

Alternatively, an intrinsic defect of the gall
bladder itself may be responsible for the
enlargement of gall bladder volume in PSC. It
has been suggested that the gall bladder is
involved in the inflammatory process in
patients with PSC.`0 '3 3 One study has shown
an inflammatory response in the gall bladder
very similar to that found in the liver in patients
with PSC.'3 This finding is in line with the
concept that, contrary to PBC, in PSC the
entire biliary tree can be affected.36 We found
overt gall bladder wall abnormalities in four
patients, all with a normal gall bladder volume.
In most of the other patients the gall bladder
wall was normal but gall bladder volume
increased. It can be hypothesised that these
patients have a gall bladder with a dys￾functional mucosa leading to decreased bile
concentration or increased secretion and sub￾sequent increase of gall bladder volume.
Theoretically, if the entire gall bladder wall is
involved, thickening of the wall will prevent
enlargement of the gall bladder. The concept
of poorly concentrated, less viscous bile may
also explain why gall bladder emptying is
efficient even in patients with extrahepatic bile
duct stricturing. Further studies are needed to
clarify whether dysfunction of the gall bladder
mucosa plays a part in the enlargement of the
gall bladder in PSC.
Finally, mediators of gall bladder motility
such as acetylcholine37 and cholecystokinin38
may be modified during cholestasis. None of
our patients was known to have autonomic
neuropathy. Furthermore, the rapid and
efficient gall bladder emptying in response to
a meal suggests normal neurohormonal regu￾lation of gall bladder motility in patients with
PSC.
In conclusion, apart from thickening of the
gall bladder wall, patients with PSC often
present with enlargement of the gall bladder.
Sonographic determination of fasting gall
bladder volume may be a useful, non-invasive,
and easy to perform tool in the evaluation of
patients suspected of having PSC, particularly
patients with ulcerative colitis with disturbed
liver biochemistry.
