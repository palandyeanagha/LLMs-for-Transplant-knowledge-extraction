Angiogenesis is required for tissue repair; but abnormal angiogenesis or neovascularization
(NV) causes diseases in the eye. The avascular status in the cornea is a prerequisite for
corneal clarity and thought to be maintained by the equilibrium between proangiogenic and
antiangiogenic factors that controls proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells
(ECs) sprouting from the pericorneal plexus. VEGF is the most important intrinsic factor for
angiogenesis; anti-VEGF therapies are available for treating ocular NV. However, the effec￾tiveness of the therapies is limited because of VEGF-independent mechanism(s). We show
that Zeb1 is an important factor promoting vascular EC proliferation and corneal NV; and a
couple of small molecule inhibitors can evict Ctbp from the Zeb1–Ctbp complex, thereby
reducing EC Zeb1 expression, proliferation, and corneal NV. We conclude that Zeb1-
regulation of angiogenesis is independent of Vegf and that the ZEB1–CtBP inhibitors can be of
potential therapeutic significance in treating corneal NV.

Angiogenesis is an important process for tissue repair upon
traumatic injuries and ischemic damages1,2. However,
abnormal angiogenesis, also known as neovascularization
(NV), causes diseases in the eye3,4. The cornea is an avascular
tissue, an ideal model tissue to study NV because of its trans￾parent and accessible nature5. Corneal NV is a common ocular
NV disease that can be resulted from allograft transplant, contact
wear, traumatic injury, and pathogenic infection-induced
inflammation, and is a top third cause for blindness world￾wide3. Many cytokines and growth factors secreted by local
stromal and immune cells in the affected cornea promote new
vessel projection from the pericorneal plexus3. Consistent
inflammation induces corneal NV, irreversibly damages the
endothelium, results in scars in the stroma, leading to decreased
vision and even blindness3. Normal corneal transparency is based
on its avascular physiology that is maintained by a large quantity
of antiangiogenic factors in the cornea3. The mechanism under￾lying the inflammation-induced NV is thought to be imbalance
between pro- and anti-angiogenesis factors, among which vas￾cular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor VEGFR
are the most important intrinsic factors for initiation and pro￾gression of NV3,6. The molecular signal for VEGF-induction of
NV is initiated when VEGF binds to the receptor tyrosine kinase
(RTK) VEGFR, the auto-phosphorylation of VEGFR induced by
the ligand VEGF leads to series of cascades of phosphorylation of
downstream kinases to the final MAP kinase ERK and results in
vascular endothelial cell (EC) proliferation to generate new vessels
by sprouting6,7.
In the injured cornea, large quantities of apoptotic cytokines
and proteinases are released from the epithelium basal membrane
and stromal keratocytes, leading to keratocyte death and intru￾sion of leukocytes8. The intruded immune cells secrete a large
number of angiogenic cytokines including VEGF8. Modulation of
VEGF activity could inhibit NV induction and progression6,7.
Anti-VEGF therapy is popular for treating neovascular age￾related macular degeneration (nAMD), diabetic macular edema
(DME), neovascular glaucoma, and to a less extend for treating
corneal NV9–11. The major issues of the anti-VEGF therapy
include that not all patients respond to the therapy and the
therapy becomes less or even not effective over time10, suggesting
that at least two mechanisms exist: VEGF-dependent and VEGF￾independent. Therefore, comprehensively understanding the
molecular mechanism underlying NV including tumor-related
NV is critical for formulating a novel strategy to treat NV.
ZEB1 is an important transcription factor (TF) for epithelial to
mesenchymal transition (EMT)12. Our group and other
researchers find that ZEB1 is an oncogenic factor in promoting
tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion13–27. Recently,
ZEB1 has been associated with NV in breast cancer28. Depending
on the interactive partner, ZEB1 can repress or promote
expression of target genes12. In general, ZEB1 stays on associated
genes to repress their expression by accommodating a histone
deacetylase (HDAC) via the partner called C-terminal binding
protein (CtBP) to make double-strand DNA (dsDNA) not
accessible for the RNA polymerase to synthesize new mRNA of
target genes12. If CtBP detaches from ZEB1 however, an acetyl￾transferase like P300 and PCAF would possibly interact with
ZEB1 to form a new partnership to make dsDNA more accessible
for mRNA synthesis of target genes, thereby promote their
expression12. The maintenance of ZEB1 repression capacity
depends on the ZEB1–CtBP complex integrity, or vice versa. Co￾factors are required or excluded to maintain the ZEB1–CtBP
complex29. For example, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK) can phosphorylate MAPK-regulated corepressor-interact￾ing protein 1 (MCRIP1) to keep ZEB1–CtBP repression of gene
expression30. Therefore, inhibition of these kinase activities by
specific small molecule inhibitors like U0126 would increase
expression of target genes30. ZEB1 target genes include the epi￾thelial cell-specific gene E-cadherin (CDH1) and cyclin￾dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs), whose expression would
result in inhibition of cell proliferation12. Here for the first time,
we show that homozygous knockout of Zeb1 (Zeb1−/−) retards
vasculogenesis in embryonic mouse lungs, and partial deletion of
Zeb1 reduces alkali-induced mouse corneal NV. We also show
that deletion or knockdown of Zeb1 reduces mouse embryonic
fibroblast (MEF) and mouse retinal microvascular endothelial cell
(mRMVEC) proliferation, respectively, with no downregulation
of their Vegf expression. As is the case with ZEB1, few small
molecule inhibitors of transcription factors are known31. As an
alternative to direct inhibition, we have taken advantage of the
ZEB1 interaction with CtBP, which can be targeted29. We provide
evidence that the ZEB1–CtBP inhibitors MTOB and NSC95397
can physically evict Ctbp from the Zeb1–Ctbp complex thereby
upregulate expression of the miR-200 family, leading to reduction
of Zeb1 expression, mRMVEC proliferation, and mouse corneal
NV severity. We conclude that ZEB1-regulation of corneal NV is
independent of VEGF and the ZEB1–CtBP inhibitors can be of
potential therapeutic significance in treating ocular NV3, and
likely cancers as well.
Results
Zeb1-regulation of vasculogenesis in fetal mouse lungs. Zeb1 is
one of essential transcription factors in development, complete
loss of Zeb1 function results in death of Zeb1−/− mouse
embryos32,33. To see if Zeb1 is required for normal vasculogenesis
in development, we compared the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
paraffin sections of embryonic day 19.5 (E19.5) homozygous,
heterozygous Zeb1-knockout embryos and their wild-type sib￾lings (Zeb1−/−, Zeb1−/+, and Zeb1+/+, respectively) (Fig. 1a–c).
We found that the blood capillaries in Zeb1−/− and Zeb1−/+ lung
tissue were significantly underdeveloped compared to Zeb1+/+
and the lung of Zeb1−/− was full of mesenchymal cells compared

to Zeb1+/+ and Zeb1−/+ (Fig. 1a–d). This is consistent with the
observation that ZEB1 was associated with NV in breast cancer28,
and it demonstrates that the attenuation of Zeb1 expression
reduces blood vessel formation in the lung, and the elimination of
Zeb1 is likely the cause of death of Zeb1−/− embryos32.
Zeb1 deletion reduces angiogenesis in corneal NV model mice.
To test whether Zeb1 regulates angiogenesis in adult animals, we
sought to evaluate the alkali-induced corneal NV in both Zeb1−/+
and Zeb1+/+ mice as no Zeb1−/− mouse embryo would survive
right before birth. We found that the partial deletion of
Zeb1 significantly reduced Zeb1 expression in the cornea detected
by a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) (Fig. 2a) and the alkali￾induced corneal angiogenesis and lymphogenesis in Zeb1−/+ mice
were significantly less severe than that in Zeb1+/+ mice
(Fig. 2b–d), suggesting that Zeb1 promotes angiogenesis in an
adult tissue. Angiogenesis is dependent on vascular EC pro￾liferation and migration34. To see whether Zeb1 expresses in ECs
and whether the corneal NV correlates with an increased
expression of Zeb1 in ECs, we compared newly formed vessels in
the central corneal stroma to that in the limbus of both the alkali￾burned and PBS-treated control corneas. We found that the vas￾cular ECs of the neovascularized vessels had a higher expression of
Zeb1 than that in the limbus whereas little Zeb1 was detected by
immunostaining in the vascular ECs of the PBS-treated limbus
(Fig. 3a–d) and the alkali treatment increased the number of
Zeb1+ vascular ECs (Fig. 3c) and caused corneal NV (Fig. 3d),
suggesting that new vessel formation likely needs more Zeb1 for
vascular EC proliferation.
Zeb1-regulation of NV is not through regulation of Vegf genes.
VEGF-regulation of angiogenesis is a well-known mechanism to
initiate and promote blood vessel formation7,34–37. The VEGF
family consists of four sister factors VEGFA/B/C/D. VEGFA/B
mainly bind to two major VEGF receptors VEGFR1/2 to initiate
signaling cascade in stimulating vascular EC migration and pro￾liferation while VEGFC/D mainly bind to VEGFR3 to stimulate
lymphatic vessel formation. VEGF can be an autocrine factor, but
mostly a paracrine factor that bystander stromal cells secrete to
affect vascular EC proliferation, migration, and invasion7,34–37.
To determine whether Zeb1-regulation of NV is through reg￾ulation of Vegf or not, we performed a qPCR for Vegfa, Vegfb,
Vegfc, Vegfr1, Vegfr2, and Vegfr3 genes in Zeb1+/+, Zeb1+/−, and
Zeb1−/− MEFs as corneal keratocytes are specialized fibroblast
cells in the stroma. We found that knockout of Zeb1 diminished
Zeb1 expression (Fig. 4a)18,38,39, but did not downregulate the
expression of Vegf genes in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)
(Fig. 4b). Instead, it upregulated Vegfa/b and Vegfr2 (Fig. 4b).

These results suggest that Zeb1-regulation of corneal NV is
independent of Vegf pathway.
Knockdown of Zeb1 induces senescence of mRMVECs. Loss of
Zeb1 lead to quick cellular senescence of MEFs in vitro, and
caused depletion of both mesenchymal and brain neural pro￾genitor cells in vivo40. This early cellular senescence was linked to
the de-repression of Cdk inhibitors P15 and P21 by Zeb1
knockout40. In addition, knockdown of Zeb1 by short-hairpin
RNA (shRNA) significantly reduced malignant cell proliferation
rates in many cancers22,23,26,27,41, confirming that Zeb1 is a cell
proliferation driver. To see whether knockdown of Zeb1 would
also cause cellular senescence of vascular ECs, we transduced
mouse retina microvascular endothelial cells (mRMVECs) with
Zeb1 shRNA lentivirus in culture, and isolated total RNA from
both vector control and Zeb1 shRNA cells for qPCR analysis. As
expected, the Zeb1 shRNA-transduced cells exhibited a senescent

morphology: bigger and flat with a reduced proliferation rate
compared to the vector control cells (Fig. 4c–e). The qPCR
analysis showed that the Zeb1 shRNA transduction reduced Zeb1
expression by >60% compared to the vector control; and no
significant change was detected in the expression of Vegf genes
except for an upregulation of Vegfr2 (Fig. 4f). Knockdown of
Zeb1 also significantly increased the expression of the Cdk
inhibitors P16, P27, and P57 (Fig. 4f). These results suggest that
the cease of mRMVEC proliferation is likely caused by the
induction of the Zeb1-repressed Cdk inhibitors.
ZEB1–CtBP inhibitors functionally inactivates Zeb1 in
mRMVECs. No direct Zeb1 inhibitor has ever been identified
while some indirect small molecules were suggested to inactivate
ZEB1 by inhibition of ZEB1 and CtBP interaction such as MTOB
and NSC9539729,42. MTOB, a known substrate inhibitor for
CtBP, can functionally evict CtBP from occupied promoter
regions of target genes while NSC95397 is a newly identified
compound as a potential inhibitor of CtBP interaction with
ZEB129,42. The inhibition of ZEB1–CtBP would de-repress
expression of genes like CDH1 and CDK inhibitors thereby
possibly inhibit cell proliferation. We used 10 µM NSC95397 and
10 mM MTOB based on reports29,42 to modulate Zeb1 activities
both in vitro and in vivo. mRMVEC immunostaining provided
evidence that Zeb1 was clearly present not only in the nucleus but
also in the cytosol of about 30% cells (Fig. 5a, b). However, an
addition of the ZEB1–CtBP inhibitor NSC95397 to the culture
medium significantly relocated Zeb1 from the nucleus to the
cytosol in almost 100% cells (Fig. 5a, b), whereas the inhibitor
MTOB had little effect on the translocation of Zeb1 (Fig. 5a, b).
By contrast, the treatments of both NSC95397 and MTOB did not
affect the nuclear location of Ctbp (Fig. 5a, b). To validate the
relocation of Zeb1 characterized by immunofluorescence ((IF);
Fig. 5a), we isolated both nuclear and cytosolic fractions of total
protein samples from both PBS control mRMVECs and cells
treated with either MTOB or NSC95397 for Zeb1-probed WB.
We also used Ctbp and Actb as relevant nuclear and cytosolic
controls though Actb also showed high expression in the nucleus
as reported43 (Fig. 5c). The treatment with 10 mM MTOB had no
significant effect on the relocation of Zeb1 from the nucleus to the
cytoplasm whereas the treatment with 10 µM NSC95397, how￾ever, significantly increased cytosolic Zeb1 compared to the PBS
control (Fig. 5c), which confirms the relocation of Zeb1 upon the
ZEB1–CtBP inhibitor NSC95397 treatment.
Interestingly, both ZEB1–CtBP inhibitors significantly reduced
Zeb1 expression though 10 µM NSC95397 was much more
effective than 10 mM MTOB (Fig. 5d). Again, the reduction of
Zeb1 expression by both ZEB1–CtBP inhibitors did not decrease
Vegfa expression in cultured mRMVECs (Fig. 5d). As a result, the
downregulation of Zeb1 by the Zeb1 inhibitors reduced
mRMVEC proliferation in culture (Fig. 5d, e). Ten micromolar
NSC95397 and 10 mM MTOB also reduced the capacities of
mRMVEC migration (Fig. 5f and Supplementary Fig. 1a) and
tube formation (Fig. 5g and Supplementary Fig. 1b) in vitro.
Taken together, we conclude that the functional disruption of
Zeb1–Ctbp complex by the ZEB1 inhibitors is realized through
both the translocation of Zeb1 to the cytosol from the nucleus
where it serves as a transcription factor to regulate expression of
target genes, and the attenuation of Zeb1 that results in the
inhibition of mRMVEC proliferation, migration, and tube
formation.
To check whether or not downregulation of Ctbp1 and 2 affect
Zeb1 expression and/or relocation, we manufactured Ctbp1 and
2 shRNA lentivirus particles released in the culture medium using
a commercial mixture of Ctbp1 and 2 shRNA lentiviral vector
plasmids (see “Methods”). We utilized Ctbp1 and 2 shRNA
lentivirus to knockdown Ctbp1 and 2 in mRMVECs (Ctbp_sh).
About 70−80% downregulation of Ctbp1 and 2 in mRMVECs by
the Ctbp1 and 2 shRNA lentivirus was validated by WB using an
antibody against both Ctbp1 and 2 (Fig. 6a) as both CtBP1 and
CtBP2 interact with ZEB1 and have a similar biological function
as a co-repressor in the nucleus44. Apparently, a large quantity of
Ctbp was present in the nucleus compared to a relatively small
amount of Zeb1 (Fig. 6a) and downregulation of Ctbp1 and 2 did
not significantly affect the Zeb1 expression detected by the WB
(Fig. 6a), Zeb1 relocation (Fig. 6b, c), and cell proliferation
(Fig. 6d). These results indicate that compared to Zeb1 that exists
in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, Ctbp is exclusively present in
the nucleus (Fig. 5a, c), and that in the nucleus Zeb1 mostly
interacts with Ctbp to repress expression of genes involved in cell
proliferation in mRMVECs.
Zeb1 appears to regulate itself through the miR-200 family. It
was surprising that the ZEB1–CtBP inhibitors significantly
reduced Zeb1 expression in mRMVECs because based on our
understanding, the inhibitors are not supposed to affect Zeb1
gene expression (mRNA levels). It is possible that these
ZEB1–CtBP inhibitors remove and/or prevent the repressive Ctpb
from interacting with Zeb1 so that other promotive partners like
P300 would fit in to switch Zeb1 from repressing to promoting
expression of target genes such as the miR-200 family, resulting in
repression of Zeb1. To verify whether the ZEB1–CtBP inhibitors
functionally disrupt the Zeb1–Ctbp complex, using a CtBP anti￾body we co-immunoprecipitated Zeb1 from total protein extracts
of mRMVEC cells treated with the inhibitor NSC95397 or
MTOB. As expected, the amounts of Zeb1 detected by a Western
blot (WB) were significantly less in the ZEB1–CtBP inhibitor￾treated cells compared to the PBS-treated control cells (Fig. 6e).
NSC95397 almost completely disrupted Zeb1–Ctbp complex
whereas MTOB only marginally finished the job (Fig. 6e), which
explains why NSC95297 was much more effective than MTOB in
inhibiting cell proliferation (Fig. 5e), cell migration (Fig. 5f), and
cell tube formation (Fig. 5g). The disruption of the Zeb1–Ctbp
complex may therefore de-repress the miR-200 family, a group of
well-known intracellular repressors of ZEB1, and thereby repress
Zeb1 expression15. To check whether inhibition of Zeb1 by
MTOB and NSC95397 was through upregulation of the miR-200
family members, we performed a qPCR to check the amounts of
their messages in mRMVECs. As expected, the ZEB1–CtBP
inhibitors significantly increased the expression of the miR-200
family members, particularly miR-200b and miR-200c (Fig. 6f). In
addition, we had previously demonstrated that Zeb1 physically
binds to the promoters of miR-200a/b/c18. These evidences
demonstrate that ZEB1–CtBP inhibitors inactivate the repressive
Zeb1–Ctbp complex by eviction of Ctbp and thereby depression
of the miR-200 family, leading to the downregulation of Zeb1
(Fig. 5d).
Topic application of ZEB1–CtBP inhibitors reduces corneal
NV. As demonstrated above, the ZEB1–CtBP inhibitors caused
mRMVEC senescence in culture (Fig. 5e) likely through Zeb1
reduction-induced augmentation of the cell Cdk inhibitors
(Fig. 5d). To test whether ZEB1–CtBP inhibitors can be used to
treat corneal NV, we topically applied 2.5 µl of 10 µM of
NSC95397 or 10 mM MTOB to the eyes with the alkali-induced
corneal NV twice a day for two weeks. The NV severity of the
NSC95397-treated eyes was significantly reduced compared to the
PBS-treated control eyes, whereas no significant difference was
observed between the MTOB-treated eyes and the PBS-treated
control eyes (Fig. 6g–i). This in vivo experiment result was

consistent with the in vitro mRMVEC assessments in which
NSC95397 was much more efficient to inhibit cell proliferation,
migration, and tube formation than MTOB even though the
concentration of MTOB was 1000 times higher than that of
NSC95397 (Fig. 5e–g). Taken together, we conclude that
NSC95397 is more effective than MTOB in reducing Zeb1
expression and vascular EC proliferation, migration, and tube
formation and it possesses a therapeutic potential in future
clinical applications.
Discussion
The progression of NV depends on vascular EC proliferation; in
addition to an increase in expression of VEGF for induction of
NV, keeping EC division after the initial NV induction is critical
to accomplish the extension and maintenance of new blood
vessels7,45. ZEB1 is one of the important factors directly involved
in driving tumor cell proliferation through repressing CDK
inhibitors40. However, it was not known whether ZEB1 plays an
important role in regulation of vascular EC proliferation in
angiogenesis. Here, we provide evidence that Zeb1 is required for
the lung capillary development in mouse embryos. We also show
that Zeb1 facilitates the development of mouse alkali-induced
corneal NV. This is an important discovery as the most attention
so far is paid to those promoting and inhibitory cytokines for NV,
particularly VEGF. VEGF antibodies have been widely used as
first line therapeutics to treat neovascular age-related macular
degeneration (nAMD) in the clinic. Although the intraocular
anti-VEGF therapy has had clinical success, many nAMD
patients do not attain significant visual improvement. For
examples, 50–80% of nAMD patients never achieve 20/40 vision

and 12–25% have 20/200 vision or worse despite the
treatment11,46. Critically, of those whose vision improve following
treatment, gain in visual acuity are usually lost within 4 years, and
nearly all (98%) develop untreatable central retinal atrophy with 7
years10,46. Adverse effects of the VEGF neutralization on multiple
retinal cell types, widely reported in animal models, are observed
in patients who have been treated with anti-VEGF drugs for
several years10. It has just started to apply the anti-VEGF therapy
to treat corneal NV though with a risk of reduction of corneal
epithelium repair3,47. A new strategy based on different
mechanisms of NV is needed to explore new avenues for treating
ocular NV diseases. Reducing ZEB1 expression may be one of
such avenues.
We have demonstrated that Zeb1 promotes angiogenesis
through the repression of Cdk inhibitors to promote vascular EC
proliferation; and the reduction of its expression by the loss-of￾function mutation, by the knockdown of mRNA, and by the
inhibition of its interaction with Ctbp would negatively affect
angiogenesis (Fig. 7). However, whether Zeb1-upregulation of cell
proliferation is specific to the vascular vessel endothelium is so far
not clear. In the cornea, there are multiple cell types including
epithelial cells, stromal keratocytes and resident immune cells,
and corneal endothelial cells. As regards to the alkali-induced
corneal NV, the topic application of the alkali immediately
damages the corneal epithelium and underneath tissues, and
causes inflammation in the stroma, leading to corneal edema and
NV48. In the quiescent cornea, Zeb1 was present in a large
quantity in the epithelium basal cells, but mostly in the cytosol
while the amounts of Zeb1 did not positively correlate with the
proliferative marker Ki67 in the nucleus (Supplementary Fig. 2a).
The alkali-caused corneal wound increased Zeb1 expression not
only in the epithelial basal cells but also in the stromal kerato￾cytes, positively correlating with the increase in Ki67+ cells in
both tissues (Supplementary Fig. 2b) compared to the PBS control
cornea (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Intriguingly, the inhibition of
Zeb1–Ctbp interaction by the topical application of the inhibitor
NSC95397 to the alkali-burned mouse corneas seemingly did not
affect the epithelium wound healing, but did inhibit the NV
(Fig. 6g–i) likely by reducing Zeb1 in vascular ECs in the cornea

Fig. 7 Schematic diagram of Zeb1-regulation of corneal neovascularization
(NV). The repressive complex of Zeb1–Ctbp sits on the promoters of target
genes, including the miR-200 family and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors
(Cdki) and represses their expression. The ZEB1–CtBP inhibitors such as
NSC95397 evict Ctbp from the complex and let new interacting partners like
P300 fit in to form a promotive complex to induce expression of both the
miR-200 family and Cdki. The miR-200 family in turn repress Zeb1 expre￾ssion while Cdki block vascular EC proliferation and thereby angiogenesis,
leading to reduction of the alkali-induced corneal NV.

(Fig. 3). The reason(s) for why the topical application of the
ZEB1–CtBP inhibitor did not affect corneal epithelium repair is
not known. One possibility is that corneal epithelial cells are less
sensitive to the inhibitor than other corneal stromal cells because
they express high amounts of Zeb1 (Fig. 3 and Supplementary
Fig. 2) and the reduction of Zeb1 by the inhibitor does not reach
the low threshold required for the epithelial cell proliferation. It is
of note that the small molecule NSC95397 exerts multiple inhi￾bitory function in addition to interrupt the CtBP–ZEB1 interac￾tion, it has been reported to disrupts the S100A4/myosin-IIA
interaction and inhibits S100A4-mediated depolymerization of
myosin-IIA filaments. S100A4, also known as fibroblast-specific
protein 1 (FSP1) is a typical marker for mesenchymal cells.
Repression of ZEB1 often leads to repression of S100A4. Clearly,
NSC95397 is an important small molecule that inhibits EMT
through inhibition of both S100A4/myosin-IIA and CtBP–ZEB1
interaction. In addition, S100A4 was also reported to be an
angiogenic factor, suggesting that NSC95397 is an antiangiogenic
substance by directly inhibiting both S100A4 and ZEB1 functions.
Wounding-affected corneal cells secret large amounts of
cytokines, including TGFβ that can upregulate Zeb121,49,50. TGFβ
binds to type I and II serine/threonine kinase receptors and
phosphorylates them. The phosphorylation of these kinase
receptors activates Smad2 and Smad3. The activated Smad2/3
form complexes with Smad4, and translocate into the nucleus
where the Smad complexes interact with various transcription
factors and transcriptional co-activators, and regulate the tran￾scription of target genes such ID2 and ETS151. ETS1 acts in
cooperative fashion with E2A proteins released from ID proteins,
and is involved in upregulation of ZEB151. There was no evidence
to support that ZEB1 directly upregulates angiogenic cytokines like
VEGF though some evidences did show that ZEB1 might upre￾gulate VEGF indirectly through repression of the miR-200 family
that represses VEGF28. We showed that the disruption of Zeb1
interaction with Ctbp by the ZEB1–CtBP inhibitors did upregulate
the miR-200 family members (Fig. 6f), but did not repress Vegf
expression (Fig. 5d). Stressed corneal epithelial cells secret inter￾leukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα)8. Both
IL-1β and TNFα can cause increased infiltration of immune cells
into the cornea, leading to NV8,50. We showed that the alkali￾induced corneal wound could increase Zeb1 expression (Fig. 3
and Supplementary Fig. S2) while the depletion of Zeb1 clearly
decreased TNFα expression though increased IL-1β expression in
MEFs (Fig. 4b). However, TNFα has been reported to counteract
against both TGFβ and VEGF, thereby reduces angiogenesis in
the cornea52. There are too many known and unknown cytokines
that might be involved in promoting angiogenesis, it is an
ongoing effort to clarify whether ZEB1 has other indirect role in
regulation of angiogenesis.
Methods
Animals and alkali-induced corneal NV. Young (6–8 weeks) female Zeb1+/− and
Zeb1+/+ and C57BL/6J mice were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal (IP) injection
of 100 mg/kg ketamine and 5 mg/kg xylazine and the eyelashes were trimmed. The
alkali-induced corneal NV model was created by placing a 3 M filter disc of 2 mm
diameter soaked with 2.5 µl of 1 N NaOH on the center surface of the cornea for 10
s followed by a thorough rinse with PBS for 15 s. For Zeb1 influence assessment,
five Zeb1 heterozygous knockout (Zeb1−/+) and five wild-type (Zeb1+/+) mice
were used. For ZEB1–CtBP inhibitor assessment, the C57BL/6J mice were divided
into three groups of five mice. Topical application of 2.5 µl of PBS (group 1), or 10
mM MTOB (group 2), or 10 µM NSC95397 (group 3) twice a day for 2 weeks to
the cornea53. The evaluation of corneal NV was conducted in 2 weeks after the
alkali treatment53 by two blinded and well-trained persons under a stereoscope.
The evaluation was based on three criteria: opacity (scale 0–3), NV score (scale
0–3), and vessel size (scale 0–3)53. All aspects of this study were conducted in
accordance with the policies and guidelines set forth by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee and were approved by the University of Louisville,
Kentucky, USA.
Cell lines and culture. Two kinds of cells were used for in vitro experiments.
Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were prepared from E17.5 Zeb1+/+, Zeb1+/−,
and Zeb1−/− embryos40, whereas mouse retinal microvascular endothelial cells
(mRMVECs) were purchased from Cell Biologics (Cat. #: C57–6065). They were
cultured in DMEM medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and Endothelial
Cell Medium (Cell Biologics cat. #: M1168), respectively, under 5% CO2 at 37 °C.
The above media were mixed with 1% penicillin and streptomycin antibiotics and
refreshed every 3 days until cell confluence.
Cell migration assay. Monolayer-cultured cells at confluence were treated with 5
μg/ml mitomycin C for 2 h at 37 °C and then washed with PBS, followed by a
straight scratch using a 200P pipette tip, and pictured under an inverted micro￾scope and re-pictured every day at the same location. Width of three scratched gaps
for each treatment was measured every day and the invert of the measurement was
served as a gap closing rate.
Cell tube formation assay. An aliquot of Matrigel (BD Bioscience) was warmed
up at room temperature and then left on ice briefly. Hundred-fifty microliters of
Matrigel was plated to a 48-well plate at a horizontal level that allows the Matrigel
to distribute evenly, and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. mRMVECs (9 × 104) were
resuspended with serum-free Endothelial Cell Medium, and loaded on the top of
the Matrigel. Following incubation at 37 °C overnight, tubules (meshes) in each
field were pictured and an average of tubules from 3 to 5 random fields in each well
was counted.
Cell immunofluorescence (IF). Cells were adherently cultured in 8-well chamber
glass slides coated with 0.1% gelatin for 2 days or as otherwise specified. They were
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), rinsed with PBS, and blocked with 1%
bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 3% serum of the species in which the secondary
antibody was raised. Rabbit polyclonal Zeb1 antiserum (1:500, a gift from Dr.
Douglas Darling) and mouse monoclonal CtBP antibody (1:200, Santa Cruz cat. #:
sc-17759) were used as primary antibodies together with the secondary antibody
Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse-IgG (1:500, ThermoFisher cat. #: A32723) or
Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit-IgG (1:500, ThermoFisher cat. # A32740). Nuclei
were counterstained with the Hoechst dye (1:500, Invitrogen cat. #: H1399), and
images were captured with a Zeiss fluorescence microscope.
Corneal flat-mount immunostaining. The enucleated eye was fixed in 4% PFA for
4 h and rinsed with PBS. The entire cornea was removed with the limbus from the
posterior portion of the eye and then cut into four quadrants of approximately
equal size using a pair of surgical scissors under a surgical microscope and then lied
flat on a slide. The flat corneal tissue went through following steps: blocking with
1% BSA and 3% serum, hybridizing with the first mouse antibody CD31 (1:50, BD
cat. #: 550274) and the rabbit antibody LYVE-1 (1:500, Novus cat. #: NB600-1008)
in the blocking buffer and then the secondary antibodies as with the above IF.
Nuclear counterstaining and photography were as with the above IF.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC). Eyeballs from PBS-sham-treated control and the
CtBP–ZEB1 inhibitor-treated mice were frozen in optimal cutting temperature
(OCT) medium for at least 4 h. The frozen tissues were cryosectioned for IHC with
the primary antibodies Zeb1 (1:200, a gift from Dr. Douglas Darling), CD31 (1:50,
BD cat. #: 550274), and Ki67 (1:50, BD cat. #: 550609) and processed as above IF.
Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Total RNA from cells or corneal tissues was
extracted using TRIzol solution (Invitrogen), and complementary DNA (cDNA) of
mRNA was synthesized using the Invitrogen RT kit (Invitrogen), whereas cDNA of
microRNA (miR) was prepared as previously described18,54. Briefly, the poly￾adenylation of at least 5 µg of the total RNA was completed by the poly(A)
polymerase kit (PAP; Ambion) in a 20-µl reaction volume according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The polyadenylated miR was thereafter utilized
directly for miR cDNA preparation using the reverse transcription kit (M-MLV
reverse transcriptase; Invitrogen) and the adaptor primer (5ʹ-GCGAGCACAGAA
TTAATACGACTCACTATAGG(T)12VN*−3ʹ) in a 40-µl reaction volume. qPCR
was performed using a universal primer (5ʹ-GCGAGCACAGAATTAATACGA
C-3ʹ) and a miR-specific primer (Supplementary Table 1). SYBR Green (Molecular
Probes) qPCR was performed using the Stratagene Mx3000P system. Regular PCR
primer sets were designed using the website-based program Primer3; their
sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 1. The relative amounts of the target
mRNA were estimated by the threshold cycle (Ct) values using the double-delta
method (2–(ΔCt1
–ΔCt2
) = 2–ΔΔCt, where sample 1 is compared to sample 2)55 and
normalized to the levels of the housekeeping gene Gapdh. At least three biological
samples were analyzed, each in duplicate.
Lentiviral shRNA. The target sequence of the short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) oli￾gomer used for Zeb1 silencing was 5ʹ- AAGACAACGTGAAAGACAA (Zeb1_sh).
The lentiviral vector construction (Vector Ctrl) and virus assembly procedures
were as described previously56. A mixture of 3 Ctbp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
cat. #: sc-35121-SH) and 3 Ctbp2 shRNA lentiviral vectors with puromycin

selection (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, cat. #: sc-37768-SH) were purchased and their
lentivirus particles were manufactured using 293T cells and Lipofectamin3000
(Invitrogen, cat. #: L3000-015) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly,
293T cells were cultured until 70–80% confluence when the mixture of lentiviral
package plasmids (pMDLg/pRRE, pRSV.Rev, and pMD2.G at ratio of 1:1:1) were
further mixed with the above Ctbp1 and Ctbp2 shRNA lentiviral vectors at 1:1
ratio. OPTI-MEM and lipofectamin3000 were sequentially added into a tube
containing the above plasmids and incubated at RT for 10 min. The whole mixture
was thereafter carefully added to the 293T cells cultured with fresh DMEM plus
10% FBS. Two days late collect the medium that contains the lentiviral particles for
3 days. Primary mRMVECs were infected in culture by Zeb1_sh, Ctbp_sh, and
Vector Ctrl lentivirus. The transduction efficiency for Zeb1_sh was >70% based on
EGFP-positive cell counts, whereas Ctbp-sh transduced mRMVECs were further
selected in culture by 5 µg/ml puromycin for two more weeks. The downregulation
of Zeb1 and Ctbp was quantitatively analyzed by qPCR (Fig. 4f) and WB (Fig. 6a),
respectively.
Co-Immunoprecipitation, nuclear and cytosolic protein fractionation, and
western blotting (WB). mRMVECs treated with 10 mM 4-methylthio 2-oxo￾butyric acid (MTOB) (Sigma cat. #: K6000), or 10 µM 2,3-bis{(2-Hydroxyethyl)
thiol}−1,4-naphthoquinone (NSC95397) (Sigma cat. #: N1786), or PBS, were
lysed in protein extraction lysis buffer (RIPA buffer: 150 mM, 5 mM EDTA,
50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1% NP-40) on ice for 20 min, followed by a 10-min
centrifugation at 13,000 r.p.m. The supernatant was mixed with either the CtBP
mouse monoclonal antibody attached with protein A/G agarose beads (Santa
Cruz cat. #: sc-17759AC) against both Ctbp1 and 2 or normal mouse IgG (Santa
Cruz cat. #: sc-2343AC) at the 1:10 ratio of total protein volume on a horizontal
shaker for 10 min at 4 °C. To separate total protein into nuclear and cytosolic
fractions, mRMVECs were lysed in HEPES buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH7.5, 10
mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, mM dithiothreitol, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5 mM PMSF, Sigma
proteinase inhibitor cocktail) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min.
The supernatant was saved as a cytosolic fraction. The nuclear pellet was
resuspended in nuclear extraction buffer (20 mM HEPES pH7.5, 400 mM NaCl,
1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM PMSF, Sigma proteinase inhibitor
cocktail) for 30 min on ice with vortexing at 10 min internals and then cen￾trifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant now was saved as a nuclear
fraction. The amounts of total protein were quantified. A 4–21% gradient
sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel was loaded with
10 µg of the above protein samples, and an electrophoresis was performed at
120 V for 60 min. The proteins in the gel were transferred to a polyvinylidene
chloride membrane at 4 °C overnight. The protein membrane was incubated
with the Zeb1 antiserum (Douglas Darling’s gift), CtBP antibody (Santa Cruz
cat. #: sc-17759), and the secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG HRP, Santa Cruz
cat. #: sc-2004) in blocking solution. The amounts of Zeb1, Ctbp, and Actb on
the membrane were visualized with the Amersham ECL kit (Cat. #: RPN 2106)
and detected by an X-ray film.
Statistics and reproducibility. Where applicable, data were analyzed by the two￾tail unpaired t-test. Values in the graphs were presented as means ± standard
deviations. Three-star “***” indicates p-value ≤ 0.001, two-star “**” indicates
p-value ≤ 0.01, whereas one-star “*” indicates p-value ≤ 0.05. For all studies, results
