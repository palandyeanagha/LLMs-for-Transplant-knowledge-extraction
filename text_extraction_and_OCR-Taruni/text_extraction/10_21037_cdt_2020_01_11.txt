Background: Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) caused by coronary heart disease (CHD) 
accounts for the largest proportion of patients with heart failure and is associated with the poorest prognosis. 
However, date on the perioperative risk and long-term survival of patients with HFrEF are limited. The 
present study aimed at exploring the effects of the left ventricular end-systolic volume index (LVESVI) and 
myocardial viability on perioperative risk and long-term survival after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 
in patients with HFrEF. 
Methods: This is a single center, prospective, observational study. CHD patients with symptoms and 
signs of heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <40% were enrolled consecutively from 
January 2014 to February 2018. Operative mortality, perioperative complications and long-term survival 
were compared in the patients with various LVESVIs and myocardial viabilities. The primary outcomes 
were cardiac death, myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke and revascularization [percutaneous coronary 
intervention (PCI) or redo CABG] with a median follow-up of 30±12 months.
Results: Perioperative mortality was 6.8% in the 118 patients in this study. Perioperative mortality was 
significantly higher in the low myocardial viability (LMV) group than in the high myocardial viability (HMV) 
group (12.5% vs. 3.8%, P=0.034). The 12-, 24-, 36-month major adverse cardiac event (MACE)-free survival 
rate of patients with HMV was significantly higher than that of patients with LMV (HMV vs. LMV: 96.9% 
vs. 88.6%, 93.4% vs. 85.5%, 79.4% vs. 68.2%, P=0.004). There was no difference in MACE-free survival 
among patients with different degrees of left ventricular remodeling within each group. 
Conclusions: Myocardial viability is an important factor that affects the perioperative mortality and 
long-term survival of patients with ischemic HFrEF after CABG. Left ventricular remodeling increases 
perioperative mortality but has no effect on long-term survival.

Introduction
Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem in 
the world. The incidence of HF in developed countries 
is approximately 1–2% (1). Based on different ejection 
fractions (EFs), HF is divided into HF with reduced EF 
(HFrEF) and HF with preserved EF (HFpEF). According 
to statistics, HF is diagnosed in 5.1 million adults in the 
United States (2), at least 50% of whom are diagnosed 
with HFrEF [left ventricular (LV) EF <40%] (3). The most 
common cause of HFrEF is ischemic heart disease, which 
accounts for approximately 60% of all cases (3). Compared 
with patients without HF, coronary heart disease (CHD) 
patients with HF have more clinical complications and 
higher incidences of bleeding and recurrent myocardial 
infarction; additionally, the treatments are inadequate, and 
the mortality is high (4). The prognosis of CHD patients 
with HFrEF is also significantly worse than that of non￾CHD patients with HFrEF (5,6). Therefore, how to 
effectively treat these patients is a topic worthy of exploring. 
Many retrospective studies have shown that viable 
myocardium in the LV is an important predictor of whether 
patients with ischemic HF can benefit from coronary artery 
bypass grafting (CABG). On the other hand, the subgroup 
analysis in the surgical treatment for ischemic heart failure 
(STICH) trial suggested that viable myocardium had 
nothing to do with surgical benefits. In addition, many 
researchers believed that except for viable myocardium, the 
severity of LV remodeling is also an important indicator 
for assessing the efficacy of CABG. Therefore, the role of 
myocardial viability and LV remodeling and the interactions 
between them in CABG are not clear. 
This study analyzed perioperative mortality, complications, 
and prognosis after CABG in patients with different LV size 
and myocardial viability, which aimed to explore the role of 
LV remodeling and myocardial viability and elucidate the 
clinical features of patients with HFrEF after CABG.
Methods
Patient enrollment
CHD patients with symptoms and signs of HF and an LVEF 
<40% (determined by transthoracic ultrasonography) who 
were admitted to Ward 11 of the Department of Cardiac 
Surgery, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, from January 2014 to 
February 2018 were enrolled consecutively in this study. 
All patients had signed informed consent after admission.
The exclusion criteria were patients with cardiogenic shock; 
patients with acute myocardial infarction within 3 months; 
and patients who need concurrent aortic valve surgery. 
According to the viable myocardium ratio, the patients 
were divided into two groups: (I) high myocardial viability 
(HMV): a ratio of viable to total myocardium in the LV 
≥10%; and (II) low myocardial viability (LMV): a ratio of 
viable to total myocardium in the LV <10%. In addition, the 
patients were further divided into four subgroups according 
to the mean LV end-systolic volume index (LVESVI): (I) 
HMV with small LV (LVESVI <92 mL/m2
), (II) HMV 
with large LV (LVESVI ≥92 mL/m2
), (III) LMV with small 
LV (LVESVI <92 mL/m2
), and (IV) LMV with large LV 
(LVESVI ≥92 mL/m2
). All patients used the following 
agents for more than a year: nitrates, aspirin, betaloc, statins 
and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or 
angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs).
Determination of viable myocardium
All 118 enrolled patients underwent myocardial perfusion 
imaging at rest and myocardial metabolism tomography via 
positron emission tomography (PET) at the Department 
of Nuclear Medicine of Beijing Anzhen Hospital. The 
infarcted myocardium region was defined as the region 
in which the perfusion images were compatible with the 
metabolic data, while the viable myocardium region was 
defined as the region in which the perfusion images were 
not compatible with the metabolic data. The ratio of viable 
myocardium was calculated based on the number of viable 
segments. Based on the previous research (7,8), a ratio of 
viable to total myocardium in the LV <10% was defined as 
LMV, and a ratio ≥10% was defined as HMV.
Determination of LVEF and LVESV
Tw o s o n o g r a p h e r s p e r f o r m e d t r a n s t h o r a c i c 
echocardiography to determine the LVEF and LVESV 
before surgery. Patients with an EF <40% that was 
confirmed by the two sonographers were enrolled. If there 
was disagreement between the two sonographers regarding 
an EF, a third sonographer repeated the examination and 
confirmed the results. LVESV was the average of the two 
measurements. The LVESVI was obtained by normalizing 
the LVESV to the body surface area of the patient.
Follow-up
Follow-up was performed at 3, 6 and 12 months after

surgery and then once a year. The clinical endpoints were 
obtained by telephone follow-up, door-to-door follow￾up or clinical follow-up. The main examinations included 
echocardiography, electrocardiography, coronary computed 
tomography angiography (CTA), PET myocardial perfusion 
imaging at rest, PET myocardial metabolic tomography, 
routine blood tests, liver and kidney function tests and 
cardiac function tests. The primary endpoints were all-cause 
death and major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) which 
including revascularization, myocardial infarction, stroke, 
HF, death from cardiovascular cause.
Statistical analysis
This is a single center, prospective, observational study. 
SPSS 25.0 software was used for statistical analyses. The 
baseline characteristics of the groups were compared 
using Student’s t-test for continuous variables and the χ2
statistic for categorical variables. Continuous variables were 
reported as mean with standard deviation and categorical 
variables were reported as percentage. Survival analysis 
was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method. P<0.05 was 
considered statistically significant.
Results
All 118 patients underwent myocardial perfusion imaging 
at rest and myocardial metabolism tomography via PET. 
The mean LVESVI was 92 mL/m2
. A total of 78 patients 
with a ratio of viable to total myocardium in the LV ≥10% 
were included in the HMV group, and 40 patients with a 
ratio <10% were included in the LMV group. There were 
no significant differences in preoperative LVEF, LVESVI, 
and cardiac function between the high and LMV groups. 
In the HMV group, the proportion of patients with 
previous interventional therapy was higher than that in the 
LMV group, which may be the reason why more viable 
myocardium was preserved in these patients (Table 1). In 
patients with HMV, the severity of LV remodeling was not 
correlated with patient EF and cardiac function (Table 2). 
In contrast, in patients with LMV, the lower the EF and 
the worse the cardiac function were, the more severe the 
LV remodeling. In addition, in the LMV group, patients 
with severe LV remodeling had a higher rate of previous 
myocardial infarction than did patients with mild LV 
remodeling (Table 3).
Perioperative mortality was 6.8% for the 118 patients. 
Perioperative mortality was significantly higher in the 
LMV group than in the HMV group (12.5% vs. 3.8%, 
P=0.034), and the proportion of patients with mechanical 
assistance, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation 
(ECMO) and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), was higher 
in the former group than in the latter group during the 
perioperative period (IABP: 75.0% vs. 47.4%, P=0.004; 
ECMO: 22.5% vs. 1.3%, P<0.010). Patients with LMV 
were more susceptible to atrial fibrillation (AF) after 
surgery than were with those with HMV (35.0% vs.
14.1%, P=0.011) (Table 4). Subgroup analysis was further 
performed according to a mean LVESVI of 92 mL/m2
. In 
the HMV group, the incidence of postoperative AF and the 
rate of IABP use were significantly higher in the patients 
with severe LV remodeling than in those with mild LV 
remodeling (AF: 25.0% vs. 6.5%, P=0.024; IABP: 62.5% vs.
36.9%, P=0.031). The mortality was higher in the former 
group but not significantly different between the groups 
(6.3% vs. 2.2%, P=0.561) (Table 5). In the LMV group, the 
rate of ECMO use and the incidence of postoperative AF in 
patients with severe LV remodeling were higher than those 
in patients with mild LV remodeling (ECMO use: 38.9% vs.
9.1%, P=0.043; AF incidence: 61.1% vs. 13.6%, P=0.031). 
Perioperative mortality reached 22.2% in the LMV group 
(Table 6). Thus, patients with LMV had the highest risk of 
surgery. 
Follow-up was performed for 75 patients in the HMV 
group and 35 patients in the LMV group with a mean 
period of 30±12 months. The 12-, 24-, 36-month MACE￾free survival rate of patients with HMV was significantly 
higher than that of patients with LMV (HMV vs. LMV: 
96.9% vs. 88.6%, 93.4% vs. 85.5%, 79.4% vs. 68.2%, 
P=0.004, Figure 1A). There was no difference in MACE￾free survival between patients with different degrees of LV 
remodeling within each group (Figure 1B,C). Patients with a 
high ratio of viable myocardium had a better prognosis, and 
the severity of LV remodeling did not affect the long-term 
prognosis of patients. The details of MACEs are shown in 
Tables 7,8.
Discussion
The LVESVI is an important parameter for evaluating 
the severity of LV remodeling. The ratio of viable to total 
myocardium in the LV can accurately reflect the degree 
of myocardial infarction. Based on the LVESVI and 
myocardial viability, this study analyzed the perioperative

risk and long-term survival of CHD patients with HFrEF 
who underwent CABG. This study suggests that patients 
with a ratio of viable myocardium ≥10% and mild LV 
remodeling have an acceptable operative mortality of 2.2%. 
However, patients with a ratio of viable myocardium <10% 
and a significantly enlarged LV have a high perioperative 
risk, 22.2%, indicating that surgical indications for these 
patients need to be fully evaluated. Myocardial viability is 
an important factor that affects the perioperative mortality 
and long-term survival of patients with ischemic HFrEF 
after CABG. The LVESVI is an indicator for perioperative 
mortality in patients with LMV but is not an indicator for 
long-term survival.
Beginning with the pioneers Isom and Baird (9,10), 
cardiac surgeons have made sustained efforts to reduce the 
surgery mortality of CHD patients with LV dysfunction. 
In the 1970s and 1980s, the mortality rates were 15% and 
10%, respectively. Currently, the mortality rate is less than 
5% for CHD patients with an EF between 10% and 30% 
who undergo CABG (10-16). For the patients enrolled in 
this study, the average LVEF was 33% (23–39%), and the 
overall mortality was 6.8% (8/118). The subgroup analysis 
showed that the operative mortality was 2.2% in patients 
with a ratio of viable myocardium ≥10% and low LVESVI. 
This result suggests that these patients are suitable for 
CABG. However, the operative mortality reached 22.2% in 
patients with a ratio of viable myocardium <10% and high 
LVESVI. Determining whether these patients are suitable 
for CABG requires a joint evaluation with cardiologists to 
develop an individualized treatment plan. In this current 
study, there was no significant difference in the LVESVI 
between the HMV group and the LMV group (91±29 
vs. 94±36, P=0.153), but operative mortality, incidence 
of postoperative AF and percentage of perioperative 
mechanical assistance were lower in the former than in 
the latter (3.8% vs. 12.5%, P=0.034; 14.1% vs. 35.0% 
P=0.011; IABP: 75.0% vs. 47.4% P=0.004; ECMO: 22.5% 
vs. 1.3%, P<0.010). This suggests that myocardial viability 
is an important factor that affects operative mortality and 
complications and should be fully assessed before surgery. 
In addition, the LVESVI is positively associated with 
mortality in patients with similar myocardial viabilities and 
is another important factor that affects operative mortality 
and complications. Therefore, for CHD patients with 
HFrEF, a preoperative risk assessment should not only 
consider the viable myocardium ratio but also consider the 
severity of LV remodeling.
In terms of long-term prognosis, a series of previous

studies suggested that improvement in cardiac function 
after CABG is common in patients with a certain 
myocardial viability and mild LV remodeling. In patients 
with severe LV remodeling, regardless of the degree of 
myocardial viability, postoperative cardiac function is not 
significantly improved. Yamaguchi et al. (17) observed 20 
patients with an LVEF <30% who underwent CABG and 
found that the patients with an LVESVI <100 mL/m2
 had 
significantly improved postoperative cardiac function, 
while patients with an LVESVI ≥100 mL/m2
 did not have 
significant improvement compared to preoperative cardiac 
function. Similarly, Bax et al. (18) showed significant 
improvement in postoperative cardiac function in patients 
with a mean LVEF of 29%, certain myocardial viability 
{[18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) single photon emission 
computed tomography (SPECT)] and a small end-systolic 
volume (ESV). Schinkel et al. (19) used dobutamine stress 
echocardiography to measure myocardial viability. Their 
results were consistent with previous studies and showed 
the ESV was negatively correlated with LVEF. Mandegar 
et al. (20) performed CABG in 85 patients with an LVEF 
<35%. Preoperative myocardial viability was assessed 
by dobutamine stress echocardiography. The follow-up 
showed that patients with more than six viable myocardial 
segments had an improved postoperative EF, while patients 
with less than six viable myocardium segments and a high 
ESV had no improvement in postoperative EF. However, 
none of these studies analyzed the long-term survival 
of patients. Moreover, SPECT and dobutamine stress 
echocardiography are not the best methods for determining 
myocardial viability. In this study, myocardial viability of 
the patients was determined by PET, and the long-term 
event-free survival of patients was analyzed, addressing 
the shortcomings of the aforementioned studies. The 
mean follow-up period in this study was 30±12 months. 
The event-free survival rate in the HMV group was 
significantly higher than that in the LMV group. There 
was no correlation between the LVESVI and event-free 
survival in patients with similar myocardial viabilities. That 
suggests that myocardial viability is an important factor 
that affects the long-term survival of patients. The severity 
of LV remodeling is not related to long-term survival. 
Considering this study and previous studies, there seems to 
be no correlation between LV remodeling and postoperative 
LV function improvement or long-term survival. However, 
interactions between and among the three parameters need 
to be determined through further studies.

Limitation of the study
Due to the small sample size in this study, we used 10% 
as the viable myocardium ratio cut-off value to divide the 
patients into the low viability and high viability groups; 
however, two groups were not adequate. When more 
patients are enrolled in the study, another group, viable 
myocardium ratio between 10% to 20% will be added. This 
will further help in understanding the effects of the viable 
myocardium ratio on perioperative risk and long-term 
prognosis. Similarly, due to the small sample size in this 
study, the LVESVI cut-off value was the mean LVESVI, 
92 mL/m2
. We concluded that LV remodeling does not 
affect the survival of patients. However, this conclusion 
may not be accurate. As the sample size increases, we will

further scientifically classify the severity of LV remodeling 
(<60 mL/m2
, 60–90 mL/m2

) to more rationally 
evaluate the impact of LV remodeling on perioperative risk 
and long-term survival.
Conclusions
The results of this study suggest that patients with a low 
viable myocardium ratio and significant LV enlargement have 
a high perioperative risk and that patients with a low viable 
myocardium ratio have a poor prognosis. Myocardial viability 
is an important factor that affects the perioperative mortality 
and long-term survival of post-CABG patients with ischemic 
HFrEF. LV remodeling increases perioperative mortality but 
has no effect on long-term survival.
