Background: Conception, pregnancy, and lactation following solid
organ transplantation require appropriate management. The most
frequently used immunosuppressive drug combination after solid
organ transplantation consists of tacrolimus (Tac) plus mycophenolic
acid (MPA). Here, the effects of Tac and MPA on fertility, pregnancy,
and lactation are systematically reviewed, and their implications for
therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) are discussed.
Methods: A systematic literature search was performed (August
19, 2019) using Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central
Register of controlled trials, Google Scholar, and Web of Science,
and 102 studies were included. Another 60 were included from the
reference list of the published articles.
Results: As MPA is teratogenic, women who are trying to conceive
are strongly recommended to switch from MPA to azathioprine.
MPA treatment in men during conception seems to have no adverse
effect on pregnancy outcomes. Nevertheless, in 2015, the drug label
was updated with additional risk minimization measures in a preg￾nancy prevention program. Data on MPA pharmacokinetics during
pregnancy and lactation are limited. Tac treatment during concep￾tion, pregnancy, and lactation seems to be safe in terms of the health
of the mother, (unborn) child, and allograft. However, Tac may
increase the risk of hypertension, preeclampsia, preterm birth, and
low birth weight. Infants will ingest very small amounts of Tac via
breast milk from mothers treated with Tac. However, no adverse
outcomes have been reported in children exposed to Tac during
lactation. During pregnancy, changes in Tac pharmacokinetics result
in increased unbound to whole-blood Tac concentration ratio. To
maintain Tac concentrations within the target range, increased Tac
dose and intensified TDM may be required. However, it is unclear if
dose adjustments during pregnancy are necessary, considering the
higher concentration of (active) unbound Tac.
Conclusions: Tac treatment during conception, pregnancy and
lactation seems to be relatively safe. Due to pharmacokinetic
changes during pregnancy, a higher Tac dose might be indicated
to maintain target concentrations. However, more evidence is needed
to make recommendations on both Tac dose adjustments and
alternative matrices than whole-blood for TDM of Tac during
pregnancy. MPA treatment in men during conception seems to have
no adverse effect on pregnancy outcomes, whereas MPA use in
women during conception and pregnancy is strongly discouraged.

INTRODUCTION
In 1958, the first pregnancy after solid organ trans￾plantation (SOT) occurred.1 The pregnant woman had
received a kidney from her identical twin sister, and therefore,
no immunosuppression was required to prevent rejection.
Two years after the transplantation, a healthy boy weighing
3300 g was delivered by cesarean section.2,3 Since this first
successful case, pregnancy after kidney transplantation has
become more common and has also occurred in recipients
of liver, heart, pancreas, and lung transplants.4–9
Women with end-stage organ failure often experience
infertility. Following a successful organ transplantation,
fertility is usually restored rapidly (within an average of 6
months).10,11 SOT recipients of childbearing age may there￾fore consider pregnancy but should be counseled about the
risks. In general, SOT recipients are advised to postpone
conception until the graft function has stabilized.12
Despite the increasing numbers of successful pregnancies
following SOT, pregnancy in a transplant recipient is a special

situation that requires appropriate management.13 Unlike the first
reported pregnancy after SOT, most pregnant women will be
treated with immunosuppressive drugs during pregnancy and
lactation. Here, the use of the most frequently used immunosup￾pressive drug combination following SOT, namely, tacrolimus
(Tac) plus mycophenolic acid (MPA), during conception, preg￾nancy, and lactation is systematically reviewed. The effects of
these drugs on male and female fertility, their teratogenicity and
pharmacokinetics during pregnancy and lactation, and implica￾tions for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) are discussed.
METHODS
A systematic literature search was performed (August
19, 2019) using Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane
Central Register of controlled trials, Google Scholar, and
Web of Science. The search terms included “tacrolimus,”
“mycophenolic acid,” “pregnancy,” “lactation,” and “kidney
transplantation” (see Supplemental Digital Content 1 for
search strategy, http://links.lww.com/TDM/A406). The
search yielded 3083 articles. After duplicates were removed,
2351 articles were reviewed as described previously.14 After
exclusion of irrelevant articles (after the title and abstract
were read), 337 articles remained, of which the relevant 102
articles were included in this review (Fig. 1). Examination of
the reference list of the studies identified further studies (n =
60). Only full-length articles published in English and in peer￾reviewed journals after the year 1990 were included. Articles
not available at our institution were excluded.

and is characterized by increased plasma concentrations of
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone
(LH), and prolactin. Moderate reduction in glomerular filtra￾tion rate (eGFR) can increase the concentrations of gonado￾trophin hormones and prolactin. Moreover, testosterone and
estradiol concentrations are lower in patients with end-stage
renal disease than in healthy controls.15 These disturbances
can result in infertility in both male and female patients.15,16
Successful transplantation improves FSH, LH, testosterone,
estradiol, and prolactin concentrations, but the use of Tac
may counteract the normalization of the levels of these hor￾mones.16–19
Effects on Male Fertility
In animals, Tac affects sperm count, motility, and
morphology in a dose-dependent manner.20–22 In addition,
morphological alterations of the seminiferous tubules and
peritubular cells and reduction of Sertoli cells and germ cells
have been reported in rats treated with Tac.22,23 Moreover,
Tac use has been associated with embryo-lethal effects and
adverse reproductive outcomes.24 However, Tac usage does
not affect serum testosterone concentrations nor the morphol￾ogy of Leydig cells.25
In humans, studies on the effect of Tac on male fertility
are limited.11 Table 1 shows studies on gonadal and sexual
function in a total of 140 kidney transplant recipients.
Tauchmanova et al studied the HPG axis after successful
renal transplantation in patients receiving prednisone with
calcineurin inhibitors [CNIs; cyclosporin (CsA) or Tac] or
mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or azathioprine (AZA). They
reported that 15–86 months after successful renal transplan￾tation, abnormalities in the HPG axis were still present in
69% of the men. The testosterone concentration in men trea￾ted with CNIs was 10.4 6 3.1 nmol/L, which is below the
normal range (12.1–31.0 nmol/L). Testosterone concentration
was significantly lower in men treated with CNIs than in
those treated with MMF or AZA. Furthermore, dehydroepian￾drosterone sulfate and androstenedione concentrations were
significantly lower in the kidney transplant recipients receiv￾ing CNIs than in those receiving other immunosuppressive
regimens. In this study, only patients with a fully functioning
allograft were included, which explains the high eGFR values
of these patients (median, 85 mL/min; ranging from 60 to 171
mL/min). Testosterone concentrations were significantly
lower in renal allograft recipients with an eGFR level of
,85 mL/min than in recipients with a eGFR level of .85
mL/min. The authors suggested an association between
gonadal function and allograft function, instead of the immu￾nosuppressive treatment.26
Tainio et al19 compared kidney transplant recipients
using CNIs combined with AZA, MMF, or prednisolone with
healthy control subjects. The kidney transplant recipients had
significantly lower testosterone concentrations and signifi￾cantly higher LH concentrations than those of the controls.
FSH concentrations were not significantly different between
the 2 groups. Testosterone concentrations were within the
normal range.
Tondolo et al27 compared blood FSH, LH, and testos￾terone concentrations between patients receiving CNIs, siro￾limus, and sirolimus plus CNI in addition to maintenance

steroid therapy. Testosterone concentrations in men treated
with CNIs was higher than that in men treated with sirolimus
(4.39 6 1.53 ng/mL versus 3.12 6 1.23 ng/mL, respectively;
P , 0.020). No significant differences were observed in FSH
and LH concentrations.27 Kantarci et al18 found no differen￾ces in serum concentrations of FSH, LH, testosterone, and
prolactin between kidney transplant recipients treated with
either Tac or CsA. The concentrations of these hormones
were also within the normal range.
Two studies investigated testicular volume and semen
quality in transplant recipients receiving immunosuppressive
drugs including Tac. Both studies reported smaller testicular
volume and worse semen quality in renal allograft recipients
using Tac than those in healthy men. Testicular volume was
associated with low testosterone concentrations.26
Taken together, male fertility is at least partially
restored after successful kidney transplantation, despite the
use of immunosuppressive agents. The correction of infertility
following transplantation depends on the immunosuppressive
regimen. Especially, the use of the mammalian target of
rapamycin inhibitors sirolimus and everolimus has been
associated with impaired gonadal function in men.28,29 Tac
use is associated with alterations in sperm count, motility, and
morphology; low to normal testosterone concentrations and
high to normal LH and FSH concentrations. However, these
alterations seem to be caused in part by the kidney transplant
function itself, and differences compared with other immuno￾suppressive regimens, which are less potent in terms of rejec￾tion prophylaxis, are small. Moreover, successful pregnancies
fathered by men on Tac treatment have been reported. At this
moment, Tac seems to be the best treatment option for male
transplant recipients who wish to establish a family, consid￾ering both the fertility and allograft outcomes.
Effects on Female Fertility
Limited information is available regarding the effect
of Tac on the fertility of female transplant recipients.
Female fertility improves after transplantation.30–32 After
transplantation, a decrease in the prevalence of amenor￾rhea and an increase in the regularity of the menstrual
cycle has been reported in women who received CNI
treatment.33
In female rats, tacrolimus treatment (at a dose of 3.2
mg/kg) was associated with increased embryo–fetal lethality
and increased numbers of undelivered and nonviable pups.24
This experimental dose corresponds with 2.6–6.9 times the
human clinical dose, which ranges from 0.075 to 0.2 mg/kg/
d on an milligrams/square meter basis.24 Incomplete delivery
of nonviable pups was observed at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg (0.8–
2.2 times the human clinical dose range at an milligrams/
square meter basis).
In humans, the effect of Tac on female reproductive
health is unclear. Infertility rates seem to be higher than those
in the general population. In a retrospective cohort study by
Yaprak et al,34 which included 33 female renal allograft re￾cipients on a different immunosuppressive regimen, 64% of
the women, who had actively been trying did not become
pregnant within 1 year. This rate is higher than that in the
general population, where it is estimated that among women
trying to conceive, 16% fail to become pregnant within 1
year.35 In contrast, in a cohort of 148 female renal allograft
recipients, 18 of 22 women (81.8%) on Tac treatment who
had actively been trying to become pregnant for 1 year did so.
The women received Tac, an antimetabolite, and prednisolone
as immunosuppressive therapy.36
In a regression analysis, Tac use in combination with
MMF (compared with other treatment options) appeared to be
a positive predictor of pregnancy within 1 year for female
SOT recipients trying to conceive in addition to regular
menstrual cycle and age.34
Based on the above findings, despite limited data, it
appears that Tac treatment is associated with a higher to
normal infertility rate among female transplant recipients.
Pharmacokinetics of Tac
Pharmacokinetics in the Mother
During pregnancy, there are several physiologic
changes that can alter the pharmacokinetics of Tac.
Theoretically, changes in Tac absorption, distribution, metab￾olism, and excretion during gestation may cause a lower
whole-blood Tac concentration and a relatively higher
unbound Tac concentration.
Tac absorption is dependent on the activity of the efflux
transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp or ABCB1), among other
factors.37 Although P-gp activity in the kidney increases dur￾ing pregnancy,38 it is unknown whether similar changes occur
in intestinal P-gp activity.
Throughout pregnancy, the volume of distribution of
Tac changes.39 This is caused by an almost 50% increase in
maternal blood volume,40–42 a decreased red blood cell
count,40,42 decreased plasma albumin concentration,39,40 and
decreased a1-acid glycoprotein concentration throughout ges￾tation.43 These decreases in plasma protein concentrations
occur especially during the second and third trimesters.40,41,44
Normally, less than 3% of Tac is unbound (free). The
decrease in Tac binding sites on plasma proteins and eryth￾rocytes (which contain high amounts of the Tac receptor FK￾binding protein-12; FKBP-12) results in relatively high
unbound Tac concentration.40
Unbound Tac concentrations were studied in female
kidney transplant recipients during pregnancy (n = 10) and
compared with postpartum unbound Tac concentrations (n =
5) by Zheng et al.40 The target whole-blood predose Tac
concentrations were maintained by TDM throughout gesta￾tion. As a result of the described pharmacokinetic changes
and maintenance of the target Tac predose concentrations,
a 2.7 times higher area under the plasma concentration–time
curve (AUC) of unbound Tac (0.44 6 0.19 ng$h/mL versus
0.16 6 0.06 ng$h/mL; P = 0.03) and a 112% higher unbound
predose Tac concentration in blood (0.018 6 0.010 ng/mL
versus 0.009 6 0.003 ng/mL, P = 0.02) were observed in the
mid/late pregnancy than those in the postpartum period. In
both blood (0.38 6 0.13% versus 0.19 6 0.07%; P = 0.002)
and plasma (5.4 6 0.7% versus 2.8 6 0.4%; P = 0.0007),
a significantly higher proportion of unbound Tac was
observed in the mid/late pregnancy than that in the postpar￾tum period.40

The net result of the described changes is an
increased unbound to whole-blood Tac ratio. As unbound
Tac is considered pharmacologically active and only
unbound drugs in plasma can migrate to the intracellular
compartment and bind to their receptor, it was suggested
that unbound Tac concentrations may correlate better with
drug efficacy than whole-blood Tac concentrations.45
However, there are no pharmacodynamic data to support
this hypothesis.
During pregnancy, Tac metabolism changes. After
administration of several cytochrome P4503A (CYP3A)
probe substrates (midazolam and dextromethorphan) to
pregnant women, an increased oral clearance was observed,
suggesting an increase in either intestinal or hepatic CYP3A
activity (or both) during pregnancy.38,46 Indeed, when apply￾ing dose titration, the mean oral clearance (CL/F) based on
whole-blood Tac concentrations was 39% higher during preg￾nancy than that in the postpartum period (47.4 6 12.6 L/h
versus 34.2 6 14.8 L/h; P , 0.03).40 This decrease in Tac
whole-blood concentrations can be partly attributed to
increased CYP3A-mediated hepatic metabolism as a part of
normal physiologic adaption.38,44,46 Multiple studies have re￾ported Tac concentrations at different time points during
pregnancy.39,40,47–50 Three of these studies concluded that
an increase in Tac dosage was required to maintain the target
concentration.48–50 In addition, the increase in the unbound
Tac fraction in blood and plasma correlated with the Tac
whole-blood CL/F ratio (r = 0.7, P = 0.001 and r = 0.6, P
= 0.007, respectively).40 This correlation may be explained by
the higher interaction of unbound Tac with CYP3A
enzymes.44
As Tac is excreted mainly via bile, the effects of
changes in renal function44,51,52 and renal drug transporter
activity38 on Tac systemic clearance are likely to be limited.
Together, changes in Tac absorption, distribution, metabo￾lism, and excretion result in an increased unbound to
whole-blood Tac concentration ratio in both blood and
plasma. TDM using whole-blood concentrations may, there￾fore, underestimate the unbound Tac fraction. As unbound
Tac is considered the fraction available for receptor binding,
an increase in Tac dose during pregnancy might be unneces￾sary. However, because the optimal concentration of unbound
Tac is unclear, and whole-blood Tac concentrations are mea￾sured in clinical practice, it might be safer to increase Tac
dose and accept higher unbound Tac concentrations.
However, it should be noted that, in theory, the higher free
Tac fraction may increase the risk of Tac-related toxicity,
including new-onset diabetes mellitus and hypertension.
These complications may be difficult to distinguish from
pregnancy-related hypertension (or preeclampsia) and gesta￾tional diabetes.53,54
Pharmacokinetics in the Infant
Tac can enter the fetal circulation through the
placenta,47,55,56 resulting in the possibility of fetotoxic
and teratogenic effects. Tac was found in infants’ blood
at concentrations of 50%–70% lower than that of the
mother, measured within 3 days after birth (median =
1.15 ng/mL versus 0.4 ng/mL47 and median = 6.6 ng/mL
versus 1.1 ng/mL57). This suggests that Tac was either
cleared by the infant or that the placenta forms a protective
barrier or both. Tac accumulation in placental tissue was
observed both in vivo and ex vivo.55 Tac concentrations in
the placenta were 2–56 times higher than that in cord blood
(median = 2.8 ng per g placenta versus 0.4 ng/mL in cord
blood).47
P-gp is highly expressed in the placenta during early
gestation, and it might actively transport Tac back into the
maternal circulation.58 Zheng et al reported a venous umbil￾ical cord Tac concentration of 6.6 ng/mL, which corre￾sponded with 71 6 18% of the maternal blood
concentration (9.0 ng/mL). The venous umbilical cord plasma
to maternal plasma Tac concentration and the venous cord
unbound to maternal plasma Tac concentration ratios were
0.23 (0.09 ng/mL versus 0.40 ng/mL) and 0.19 (0.003 ng/
mL versus 0.017 ng/mL), respectively.59 Placental P-gp
expression was the lowest at the end of gestation.
Therefore, fetal exposure throughout gestation may be even
lower than the concentrations found in infants immediately
after birth.60
No studies have investigated the fetal volume of
distribution of Tac. Fetal hematocrit was higher than
maternal hematocrit; thus, the unbound fraction of Tac in
the fetus is likely to be lower than that in the mother.40
Tac metabolism in the fetus may be minimal owing to
low CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 expression in the fetal liver.
The predominant enzyme is CYP3A7, which metabolizes
Tac less efficiently than CYP3A4.44,61,62 During gestation,
CYP3A7 may also act in the endometrium and placenta.
From the first to the second trimester, CYP3A7 presence in
the endometrium and placenta was found to increase.63
Little is known about the development and activity of
CYP3A5. CYP3A5 expression may be independent of
age, although a study suggested higher CYP3A5 expres￾sion in children than in adults.62,64 Kociszewaska-Najman
et al measured the concentrations of the Tac metabolites
13-O-demethyl tacrolimus (13-DMT) and 15-O-demethyl
tacrolimus (15-DMT) in cord blood.65 The mean concen￾tration of Tac, 13-DMT, and 15-DMT in cord blood did not
differ from that in fetal venous blood. Zheng et al59
observed no difference in the primary Tac metabolite con￾centrations between the arterial and venous umbilical cord
blood.
At several days after birth, Tac concentrations were
found to decline rapidly, indicating the ability of a newborn
infant to clear Tac after birth.47 At 1 year after birth,
CYP3A4 activity increases rapidly and can reach 120%
of adult CYP3A4 activity.63 Bramham et al57 also found
undetectable Tac concentrations in bottle-fed infants after 8
and 20 days, in whom Tac concentrations declined by
approximately 15% per day owing to metabolism in the
infant. This is likely caused by downregulation of
CYP3A7 expression and upregulation of CYP3A4 expres￾sion shortly after birth.62 Finally, Jain et al47 reported high￾er Tac concentrations at delivery in infants with low birth
weight (LBW), suggesting a slower metabolism in preterm
or LBW infants. Those infants might need monitoring of
Tac concentrations after birth.

Teratogenicity
Immunological Outcomes
Theoretically, neonatal exposure to Tac could affect the
development of the immune system. To examine this effect,
Ono et al66 studied 28 children born to female kidney trans￾plant recipients at birth and after 8 months and compared
these children with 40 children born to healthy, nonimmuno￾suppressed mothers. The kidney transplant recipients used
a CNI (70% Tac and 30% CsA), AZA, and prednisone during
gestation. Children of mothers under immunosuppressive
therapy had significantly lower numbers of white blood cells,
neutrophils, and eosinophils than those of the controls at time
of birth. Eighty percent of the children had low B-cell num￾bers, 15% had low CD4+ T-cell numbers, and 15% had low
CD8+ T-cell numbers at birth. After 8 months, lymphocyte
counts had normalized in most children, and B-cell numbers
were higher than those in the control group.66 Drozdowska￾Szymczak et al observed no significant differences in immu￾noglobulin concentrations at birth between infants born to
mothers on Tac treatment after SOT and those born to healthy
mothers.67,68 Kociszewska-Najman et al69 reported that white
blood cell counts within the first 72 hours after birth were
within the normal limits.
In addition to decreased lymphocyte counts, 28.6% of
the children born to mothers on immunosuppressive treatment
experienced infections necessitating hospitalization during
a follow-up time of 12 months after birth, whereas this
incidence was only 7.5% in the control group.66 Compared
with another cohort consisting of 28 children born to healthy
mothers (the children were matched for gender, gestational
age, and birth weight), children of mothers on immunosup￾pressive treatment had a higher chance of hospitalization due
to infectious diseases (28.6% versus 3.6%; odds ratio, 4.351,
95% confidence interval 1.026–18.448). Kociszewska￾Najman et al did not find a significant difference in the inci￾dence of congenital infections between children born to SOT
recipients (21.1%) and those born to healthy mothers
(13.0%), despite higher rates of prematurity in children born
to transplant recipients. The rates of infections also did not
differ significantly between Tac plus corticosteroid treatment
(23.9%), CsA plus corticosteroid treatment (13.6%), and
AZA plus corticosteroid and CNI treatment (26.9%).69
Pregnancy Outcomes
In animals, Tac treatment has been associated with
decreased numbers of live births, increased incidence of fetal
malformations, LBW, and maternal toxicity.24,70 These
adverse pregnancy outcomes are dose-dependent.70
Despite the fact that Tac enters the fetal circulation, no
association between Tac and congenital malformations has
been described in humans.6,71,72 The incidence of fetal mal￾formations in children born to mothers after SOT, the major￾ity of whom were exposed to Tac during gestation, is reported
to range between 0% and 11.8% of live births.4,6,48,73–80 No
specific pattern of malformations was recognized. This inci￾dence is similar to the rate of fetal malformations in the
general population, which is estimated to be 3%. In addition,
a similar incidence of fetal malformations, ranging between
4% and 5%, was reported by the National Transplantation
Pregnancy Registry (NTPR) for SOT recipient mothers, irre￾spective of their immunosuppressive treatment.10,71,81
However, both cohort studies and studies using data
from the NTPR in SOT recipients on CNI treatment during
pregnancy (see Table S2, Supplemental Digital Content 2,
http://links.lww.com/TDM/A406, which shows pregnancy
outcomes) reported a high incidence of preterm delivery
(,37 weeks), LBW, and small for gestational age (SGA)
infants.4–6,9,36,47,48,50,73–75,77–80,82–100 In summary, among in￾fants exposed to CNIs during pregnancy, 6.1%–73.1% were
born preterm, 18.9%–67% had LBW, and 8.5%–40.7% were
SGA (see Table S2, Supplemental Digital Content 2, http://
links.lww.com/TDM/A406). Of note, most studies did not
correct birth weight for the effect of preterm delivery.
Yuksel et al89 did not find associations between the mothers’
blood Tac concentrations in the first trimester and the inci￾dence of LBW, prematurity, and other pregnancy
complications.
The higher risk for LBW and preterm delivery can be
explained by the higher incidence of pregnancy-related
hypertension and preeclampsia, which are reported to range
between 3.1%–58% and 3.1%–61.5%, respectively.4,36,48,73–
76,78–80,82–86,88,90–94,101,102 This may, in turn, be explained by
the vasoconstrictive effects of CNIs via increased release of
vasoconstrictive agents, decreased production of vasodilatory
agents, and retention of sodium and water.10,103–108 The risk
of adverse pregnancy outcomes appears to be independent of
the type of CNI used.78,92 However, the LBW and preterm
delivery may also be explained by other factors, such as
weakening of the connective tissue due to long-term steroid
use. Overall, preterm delivery is found in 45%–60% of all
pregnancies among renal transplant recipients.109 Dinelli
et al,93 followed infants born to transplant recipient mothers
under immunosuppressive treatment postpartum and com￾pared them with healthy children born at term with normal
weight for gestational age. At the age of 6 months, the 2
groups had a similar weight for age, and at the age of 12
months, the 2 groups had a similar length for age, despite
the higher incidence of premature births and SGA.
As Tac is nephrotoxic, it can be postulated that Tac
injures the infant’s kidneys. Although renal dysfunction and
high serum creatinine concentrations have been reported in
infants exposed to Tac during pregnancy,6,47 there are insuf￾ficient data to support that this was caused by Tac treatment.
Tac use during pregnancy has also been associated with tran￾sient perinatal hyperkalemia in the infant.6,47,110–112 This hy￾perkalemia was, however, resolved spontaneously within 24–
48 hours 47,112 At present, it is unclear if the risk of hyper￾kalemia is increased in children born to mothers treated with
Tac compared with that in those born to mothers not treated
with Tac.
Prenatal exposure to Tac may also be related to
childhood obesity. Schreiber-Zamor et al found a 2.8-fold
higher body mass index in children of mothers who received
Tac treatment. However, the higher body mass index was
found not to be correlated with LBW.113

who were on Tac at the time of conception were described by

Armenti et al. Ninety-seven male kidney transplant recipients
receiving CsA, Tac, MMF, sirolimus, or a combination of
these drugs were included in their study. These kidney
transplant recipients fathered a total of 126 children. The
mean gestational age (39 6 2.4 weeks) and the mean birth
weight (3244 6 649 g) were similar to those in the general
population.79,114
Breastfeeding
Tac is excreted in small amounts into human breast
milk (Table 2). Tac concentrations in breast milk were re￾ported to range between 0.0038 and 3.219 ng/
mL.47,57,59,65,115–117 Milk-to-whole-blood and milk-to￾plasma ratios were 0.08–0.23115,116 and 0.12–0.5,47,59,117
respectively. Zheng et al investigated Tac excretion into
breast milk over a 12-hour steady-state dosing interval in
one patient. The highest maternal blood and plasma Tac con￾centrations were observed at 1 hour after Tac administration,
and the highest Tac concentration in breast milk was observed
after 6 hours (1.11 ng/mL). This resulted in milk-to-blood and
milk-to-plasma AUC ratios of 0.13 and 2.89, respectively.
Unbound Tac constituted 2.7 6 0.4% (n = 3) of Tac observed
in the mothers’ plasma and 3.7 6 0.6% (n = 3) of Tac found
in breast milk. The ratio of unbound Tac in the milk-to￾plasma AUC ratio was 3.96.59
The estimated daily Tac ingestion by infants via breast
milk ranged between 0.059% and 0.9% of the mother’s
weight-adjusted dose, assuming a daily intake of 150 mL of
milk per kilogram.47,57,59,65,115–117 Based on the highest mea￾sured Tac concentration in breast milk (3.219 ng/mL65) and
the assumption that an infant consumes 150 mL/kg milk per
day, the maximum ingested dose would be 0.00048 mg/kg
per day, which is far lower than the lowest recommended
intake for pediatric SOT recipients (0.15 mg/kg per day).65
Kociszewska-Najman et al65 estimated the average ingestion
of the 13-DMT and 15-DMT metabolites to be 0.02 and 0.01
mcg/kg per day. Moreover, Zheng et al59 observed a mean
13-DMT concentration in the breast milk of 0.03 ng/mL,
whereas the concentrations of Tac metabolites 15-DMT, 31-
DMT, and 12-HT were under the limit of detection.
Breastfed children were able to eliminate Tac to
undetectable concentrations over time.47,57,117,118 Bramham
et al observed a decline in Tac concentrations of approxi￾mately 15% per day in both breastfed and bottle-fed infants.
In addition, they did not find a significant difference in Tac
concentration between breastfed and bottle-fed infants

(median, 1.3 mg/L; range, 0.0–4.0 versus 1.0 mg/L; range,
0.0–2.3; respectively; P = 0.91). The authors concluded that
the detectable Tac concentrations in these infants after birth
were caused by previous placental transfer, rather than inges￾tion via breast milk.57
Theoretically, Tac may cause immunological or neph￾rotoxic side effects in infants. However, no studies have
described any adverse outcomes in children breastfed by
mothers under Tac treatment within follow-up periods of 2–
30 months.66,115,118–121
Taken together, infants will ingest small amounts of
Tac via the breast milk of mothers under Tac treatment, but
no adverse outcomes related to Tac ingestion via breast milk
have been reported. The benefits of breastfeeding may
therefore outweigh the theoretical risks of Tac ingestion for
infants.
MYCOPHENOLIC ACID
MPA inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase,
leading to inhibition of purine synthesis and inhibition of
T-and B-cell proliferation.122 MPA can be administered as the
prodrug MMF or as enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium,
both of which are converted into MPA.
MPA is often administered to SOT recipients in
combination with Tac. However, in 2007, the United States
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) changed the pregnancy
safety category of MMF from “C” to “D,” meaning that
“There is positive evidence of human fetal risk, but potential
benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women
despite potential risks.” 123 Women under MPA treatment
should therefore stop MPA administration or switch to an
alternative immunosuppressive agent when considering con￾ception.123,124 In addition, concerns have emerged about the
safety of MPA usage in male allograft recipients during
conception.
Fertility
In male rats, MPA treatment at a dose of 20 mg/kg
per day, which corresponds to 2–3 times the therapeutic
systemic exposure in human renal allograft recipients, did
not affect fertility.123,125 To the best of our knowledge,
there are currently no data on the effect of MPA on human
male fertility.
In female rats, MPA treatment at a dose of 4.5 mg/kg
per day, which corresponds to approximately half the
therapeutic exposure in female renal allograft recipients, did
not affect fertility.123,125 Among women with systemic lupus
erythematosus, anti-Müllerian hormone concentrations were
comparable between those exposed and not exposed to
MPA.126 In addition, in a retrospective cohort study including
35 women who wished to become pregnant, predictors for
pregnancy were analyzed, and regression analysis results
showed that the use of Tac and MMF (compared with other
immunosuppressive drug regimens) was a positive predictor
of pregnancy within 1 year in women trying to conceive,
along with regular menstrual cycles after transplantation and
age at transplantation.34
Nevertheless, although insufficient evidence is avail￾able on the effect of MPA treatment on fertility, there is no
evidence of impaired fertility in both men and women.
Teratogenicity
Teratogenicity of MPA Use in Women
In vitro tests in rat whole-embryo cultures showed the
embryotoxic potential of MPA. Exposure of rat embryos to
MPA resulted in dysmorphogenic development at low MPA
concentrations and malformations at high MPA concentra￾tions.127,128 The teratogenic effects of MPA were also
observed in zebrafish and rabbit embryos.129
Data from pregnancy registries and 38 case reports (see
Table S3, Supplemental Digital Content 3, http://links.lww.
com/TDM/A406 which presents pregnancy outcomes)
showed an increased risk of spontaneous abortion, congenital
malformations, and other adverse fetal outcomes in women
under MPA treatment during conception or preg￾nancy.80,90,98,130–154 From these data, a pattern of malforma￾tions was recognized, including orofacial clefts (cleft lip and
palate), ear malformations (microtia and atresia of the external
auditory canals), micrognathia, and eye defects (coloboma
and hypertelorism). Other abnormalities that have been re￾ported, albeit with lower frequencies, are limb abnormalities,
congenital heart defects, esophageal atresia, diaphragmatic
hernia, vertebral defects, and kidney abnormalities.155,156
The exact frequencies of miscarriages and congenital
malformations are still unclear owing to small patient
numbers and potential selection biases in voluntary registries.
In women exposed to MPA during conception or pregnancy,
a spontaneous abortion rate of 40%–52% was reported.80,130–
132 The rate of congenital malformations was estimated to be
23%–27%. This rate constitutes 4%–5% of live births in SOT
recipients using other immunosuppressive agents.125
Constantinescu et al157 studied data from the NTPR and
analyzed the outcomes of 444 pregnancies in renal allograft
recipients. They concluded that discontinuation of MPA treat￾ment before conception resulted in a higher rate of live births
(78% versus 48%) and a lower rate of miscarriages (20%
versus 48%) than those in renal allograft recipients exposed
to MPA in the early pregnancy period. The rate of birth
defects in the group that discontinued MPA treatment were
similar to that in the general population. King et al158 ana￾lyzed the outcomes of 382 pregnancies reported in the NTPR.
They observed an increased risk of miscarriages and birth
defects following discontinuation of MPA in the second tri￾mester or later. In contrast to the previous studies, Ghafari and
Sanadgol159 did not find any differences in perinatal out￾comes between pregnant women exposed to MPA versus
AZA.
Teratogenicity of MPA Use in Men
In recent years, concerns about the safety of MPA use
in men during conception have emerged. Therefore, the
European Medicines Agency recommended the following:
“sexually active men taking mycophenolate are recommended
to use condom for sex during treatment and for 90 days
thereafter; partners of childbearing potential are also

recommended to use highly effective contraception for the
same period.”160,161 However, the current evidence does
not support this recommendation.
In 2015, Morken et al162 conducted a national
population-based cohort study analyzing 474 pregnancies
fathered by male transplant recipients in Norway. Data were
collected from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway and the
Norwegian Transplant Registry. They found a higher risk for
preeclampsia in pregnancies fathered by men after SOT than
in pregnancies fathered by men before SOT (adjusted odds
ratio, 7.4; 95%-confidence interval 1.1–51.4). No significant
differences in preeclampsia, major birth defects, preterm
deliveries, and SGA were found between the outcomes of
pregnancies fathered by SOT recipients and pregnancy out￾comes in the general population of Norway. The most com￾mon immunosuppressive therapy was a combination of
a CNI, glucocorticoids, and AZA or MPA. However, the
exact number of patients on MPA treatment was not specified.
Recent studies compared the outcomes of pregnancies
fathered by allograft recipients receiving MPA at the time of
conception with pregnancy outcomes in the general popula￾tion or outcomes of pregnancies fathered by SOT recipients
not exposed to MPA. Jones et al163 analyzed data of 152 male
transplant recipients under MPA treatment during conception
from the NTPR. Out of 205 pregnancies, 194 (94%) were live
births. Prematurity (,37 weeks of gestation) occurred in 21
pregnancies (10.8%), 8 children (4.1%) had a birth weight of
,2500 g, and 6 cases (3.1%) showed birth defects. These
birth defects included a club foot, ankyloglossia, Prader–
Willi syndrome, pyloric stenosis, congenital diaphragmatic
hernia (incompatible with life), and ventricular septal defect.
All percentages were comparable to those in the general
population in the United States.
Midtvedt et al160 conducted a national population-based
cohort study, analyzing outcomes of pregnancies (n = 350)
fathered by renal transplant recipients (n = 230) in Norway.
Data were collected from the Medical Birth Registry of
Norway and the Norwegian Transplant Registry. The results
revealed 155 pregnancies fathered by men exposed to MPA
during conception and 195 pregnancies fathered by men not
exposed to MPA. Malformations occurred in 3.9% of preg￾nancies in the exposed group versus 2.6% in the unexposed
group, which was not significantly different. Moreover, no
significant difference was found in gestational age or birth
weight between the pregnancy outcomes of the groups
exposed and unexposed to MPA. Finally, 2 smaller retrospec￾tive studies in male transplant recipients also reported no
association between MPA treatment and the risk of birth de￾fects.164,165 These results suggest that exposure of male SOT
recipients to MPA at the time of conception does not affect
pregnancy outcomes.
Pharmacokinetics
Because there is a strong recommendation against
prescription of MPA to women who are trying to conceive
(see previous paragraph 3.2.2.), there are very limited data on
the pharmacokinetics of MPA during pregnancy. In a newborn
whose mother used MMF during pregnancy as immunosup￾pressive treatment after renal transplantation, an MMF plasma
concentration of 3.1 mg/L was reported; however, at 10 days
after birth, the MMF plasma concentration decreased to ,0.6
mg/L.148 This supports the theory that MPA is able to cross
the placental barrier and enter the fetal circulation.
Breastfeeding
There is insufficient evidence to provide a recommen￾dation regarding MPA use during breastfeeding. In rats, MPA
was excreted into breast milk.123 However, no pharmacolog￾ical studies have investigated the presence of MPA in human
breast milk. In the NTPR, breastfeeding by a transplant recip￾ient on MPA treatment was reported only for 7 newborns, and
no adverse events associated with breastfeeding were reported
in these newborns.166,167
DISCUSSION, GAP ANALYSIS, AND OUTLOOK
Conception, pregnancy, and parenthood following SOT
are realistic options. Transplant professionals will encounter
patients who consider conception or pregnancy, and these
patients will most likely be treated with Tac plus MPA
combination therapy at the time of counseling.
MPA is teratogenic, and thus, its use during conception
and (early) pregnancy is strongly discouraged. For women
under treatment with MPA, switching to AZA or an
immunosuppressive regimen without MPA is strongly rec￾ommended. Breastfeeding during MPA treatment cannot be
considered safe owing to the lack of evidence.
Recent concerns about the safety of MPA use in men
during conception led to the European Medicines Agency
recommendation of contraception use until at least 90 days
after discontinuation of MPA treatment. However, the current
evidence does not support this recommendation. Both large,
population-based cohort studies160,163 using data of national
birth and transplantation registries, as well as smaller retro￾spective studies,164,165 did not find significant differences in
pregnancy outcomes and the risk of congenital malformations
between men using MPA and those not using MPA at the
time of conception. These results suggest that it is not neces￾sary for men to use contraception while on MPA treatment or
to switch to an alternative immunosuppressive agent. In addi￾tion, switching to an MPA-free immunosuppressive regimen
may be associated with an increased rejection risk. The Dutch
Transplant Society has issued a guidance document that rec￾ommends continuation of MPA treatment after providing
information about the scarcity of evidence for the current
warning to male transplant patients with a wish to con￾ceive.168 To collect more evidence, the transplant community
is encouraged to actively report live births from male SOT
recipients receiving immunosuppressive drugs.169
Tac may negatively affect both male and female
fertility. However, data are limited, and because fertility is
strongly affected by renal function, Tac may be the safest
option for SOT recipients wishing to become a parent.
Continuation of Tac treatment during pregnancy is
reasonable. Tac enters the fetal circulation, but this does not
appear to result in a higher risk of congenital malformation
than that in the general population. In the mother, Tac seems
to be associated with an increased risk of pregnancy-related

hypertension and preeclampsia compared with CNI-free
immunosuppressive regimens. These side effects are likely
mediated by the vasoconstrictive effects of Tac and may in
turn explain the higher incidence of LBW, preterm birth, and
SGA. Despite this, continuation of Tac during pregnancy
seems to be the best treatment option. No alternative
immunosuppressive regimen has been shown to be a better
option in terms of offering a better balance between adequate
immunosuppression and adverse outcomes for mother and
child. Data on other immunosuppressive agents during
pregnancy are scarce.170
Implications for TDM
Little to no data are available on MPA pharmacokinet￾ics during pregnancy and breastfeeding in both mother and
child, and therefore, no evidence-based recommendations
regarding TDM of MPA for these specific clinical situations
can be made.
Tac has a narrow therapeutic index and its adverse
effects during pregnancy in animals appear to be dose
dependent. Close maintenance of women in the Tac target
exposure range during pregnancy is therefore of utmost
importance.
Pregnancy causes alterations in the pharmacokinetics of
Tac. CYP3A expression is increased, resulting in increased
Tac (first-pass) metabolism. The volume of distribution of
Tac also increases (owing to changes in the hematocrit and
plasma protein concentrations), resulting in a decrease in
whole-blood Tac concentration but also in an increased
unbound Tac-to-total Tac concentration ratio. During normal
pregnancy, the mother does not develop an immune response
toward the fetus. It has been hypothesized that pregnancy￾induced hyporesponsiveness of the mother’s immune system
might also lead to tolerance toward the allograft, allowing
reduction of immunosuppressive therapy. However, immuno￾logical changes during pregnancy are complex, and it is
unclear whether pregnancy decreases or increases the risk
for alloimmune responses and rejection.171–173 To the best
of our knowledge, only one case of allograft tolerance fol￾lowing pregnancy has been reported. In this case, all immu￾nosuppressive therapy could be stopped during pregnancy in
a mother who had received a renal transplant 9 years pre￾viously.174 Although no increased rejection incidence has
been reported in patients without dose adjustments,5,6 owing
to low whole-blood Tac concentrations, it is recommended to
increase the daily Tac dose by 20%–45% to maintain the
target predose concentrations.49,50 However, how this strat￾egy affects the unbound Tac concentrations is unclear,
although they are likely to increase relative to the total Tac
concentrations. As unbound Tac is considered a part of the
drug, which is able to bind to the receptor, unbound Tac
concentrations may correlate better with drug efficacy com￾pared with whole-blood Tac concentrations. Monitoring of
unbound Tac during pregnancy seems to be reasonable, espe￾cially when toxicity occurs or in women with anemia and/or
hypoalbuminemia.37,39 However, no unbound Tac target con￾centrations have been defined.
Because the optimal concentration of unbound Tac is
unclear, measurement of unbound Tac is unavailable in many
laboratories, and in clinical practice, whole-blood Tac con￾centrations are measured, it may be safer to increase the Tac
dose and accept higher unbound Tac concentrations.
Considering the changes in pharmacokinetics during preg￾nancy, one may expect changes in Tac concentrations at the
target site, which in turn can affect clinical outcomes. Tac
concentration in lymphocytes could be an appropriate matrix
to monitor Tac treatment.175–178 In a study by Capron et al,
179 intracellular Tac concentration was correlated with both
the development and severity of rejection after liver trans￾plantation. However, the authors of this review think that at
present, there is insufficient evidence to make recommenda￾tions regarding the optimal matrix for TDM of Tac during
pregnancy. More research is necessary on the effects of preg￾nancy on unbound and intracellular Tac concentrations, as
well as their effect on clinical outcomes.
During breastfeeding, infants will ingest very low
amounts of Tac, which are estimated to range between
0.059% and 0.9% of the mother’s weight-adjusted daily
dose.65 No Tac-related adverse events have been reported in
breastfed children, and thus, Tac treatment is considered not
an absolute contraindication for breastfeeding. Moreover,
TDM of the infant is unlikely to improve patient care.
CONCLUSION
Taken together, Tac treatment during conception,
pregnancy, and lactation seems to be relatively safe in terms
of the health of the mother (unborn) child, and allograft.
However, more evidence is needed to make recommendations
on both Tac dose adjustments and alternative matrices to
whole-blood for TDM of Tac during pregnancy. As MPA is
teratogenic, it is strongly recommended that women who are
trying to conceive switch from MPA to AZA. MPA treatment
in men during conception seemsto have no adverse effect on
pregnancy outcomes.
