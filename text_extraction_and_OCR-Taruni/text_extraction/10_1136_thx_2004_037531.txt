Abstract
Background: Because oxidative stress affects muscle function, the
underlying mechanism to explain exercise induced peripheral
muscle oxidative stress in patients with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) is clinically relevant. This study
investigated whether chronic hypoxaemia in COPD worsens
peripheral muscle oxidative stress and whether an abnormal muscle
inflammatory process is associated with it.
Methods: Nine chronically hypoxaemic and nine non-hypoxaemic
patients performed repeated knee extensions until exhaustion.
Biopsy specimens were taken from the vastus lateralis muscle before
and 48 hours after exercise. Muscle oxidative stress was evaluated
by lipid peroxidation (lipofuscin and thiobarbituric acid reactive
substances (TBARs)) and oxidised proteins. Inflammation was
evaluated by quantifying muscle neutrophil and tumour necrosis
factor (TNF)-α levels.
Results: When both groups were taken together, arterial oxygen
pressure was positively correlated with quadriceps endurance time
(n = 18, r = 0.57; p<0.05). At rest, quadriceps lipofuscin inclusions
were significantly greater in hypoxaemic patients than in non-
hypoxaemic patients (2.9 (0.2) v 2.0 (0.3) inclusions/fibre;
p<0.05). Exercise induced a greater increase in muscle TBARs and
oxidised proteins in hypoxaemic patients than in non-hypoxaemic
patients (40.6 (9.1)% v 10.1 (5.8)% and 51.2 (11.9)% v 3.7
(12.2)%, respectively, both p = 0.01). Neutrophil levels were
significantly higher in hypoxaemic patients than in non-hypoxaemic
patients (53.1 (11.6) v 21.5 (11.2) counts per fibre × 10−3;


p<0.05). Exercise did not alter muscle neutrophil levels in either
group. Muscle TNF-α was not detected at baseline or after exercise.
Conclusion: Chronic hypoxaemia was associated with lower
quadriceps endurance time and worsened muscle oxidative stress at
rest and after exercise. Increased muscle neutrophil levels could be
a source of the increased baseline oxidative damage. The
involvement of a muscle inflammatory process in the exercise
induced oxidative stress of patients with COPD remains to be
shown.
