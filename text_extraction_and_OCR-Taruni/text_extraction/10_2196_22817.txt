Abstract
Background: Evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has generally increased levels of stress and depression among
the public. However, the impact on college students in the United States has not been well-documented.
Objective: This paper surveys the mental health status and severity of depression and anxiety of college students in a large
university system in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods: An online survey was conducted among undergraduate and graduate students recruited from Texas A&M University
via email. The survey consisted of two standardized scales—the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the General Anxiety
Disorder-7—for depression and anxiety, and additional multiple-choice and open-ended questions regarding stressors and coping
mechanisms specific to COVID-19.
Results: Among the 2031 participants, 48.14% (n=960) showed a moderate-to-severe level of depression, 38.48% (n=775)
showed a moderate-to-severe level of anxiety, and 18.04% (n=366) had suicidal thoughts. A majority of participants (n=1443,
71.26%) indicated that their stress/anxiety levels had increased during the pandemic. Less than half of the participants (n=882,
43.25%) indicated that they were able to cope adequately with the stress related to the current situation.
Conclusions: The proportion of respondents showing depression, anxiety, and/or suicidal thoughts is alarming. Respondents
reported academic-, health-, and lifestyle-related concerns caused by the pandemic. Given the unexpected length and severity of
the outbreak, these concerns need to be further understood and addressed.

Introduction
The United States has seen a surge in the number of COVID-19
cases since March 2020, with initial peaks in April 2020 [1].
Recent assessments of mental health in the general populace of
China and Iran, countries that had major outbreaks, show
increased levels of stress due to the pandemic [2,3]. A key
concern during the pandemic relates to the mental health of
vulnerable populations, including college students. The 2019
Annual Report of the Center for Collegiate Mental Health [4]
reported that anxiety continues to be the most common problem
(62.7% of 82,685 respondents) among students who completed
the Counseling Center Assessment of Psychological Symptoms.
Consistent with the national trend, Texas A&M University has
seen an increase in the number of students seeking services for
anxiety disorders over the last few years. Given the vulnerability
of this population during the pandemic, there is a critical need

to assess the mental health of college students in order to address
concerns in a timely manner [5-8].
Recent assessments of college student mental health in China
have shown an increased level of anxiety and depression in the
wake of the pandemic [6,9]. These studies used standardized
scales for depression and anxiety, such as the depression and
anxiety stress scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9),
and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire.
General panic related to the outbreak and risk of exposure were
found to be contributors to increased level of depression.
Similarly, Cao et al [9] assessed anxiety using the GAD-7 scale
and found that risk of infection, including for family members,
was a major contributor to college students’ increased anxiety.
Both studies also identified important protective factors such
as income stability and the availability of information related
to preventative measures. However, these studies do not include
an assessment of strategies used by students themselves for
coping with and managing their stress. Additionally, these
studies have focused on the student population in China. Given
the differences in cultural, geographic, economic, and other
factors, an assessment of college students’ mental health in the
United States is needed.
The aim of this study was to conduct a survey-based assessment
of mental health among college students at Texas A&M
University, a large university in the United States, during the
COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to identify severity levels of
depression and anxiety symptoms (primary outcome), as well
as stressors related to the pandemic, coping mechanisms used,
and barriers experienced by students in handling
pandemic-related stress.
Methods
Recruitment
An online cross-sectional survey was designed and conducted
during the initial peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the late
Spring 2020 semester at Texas A&M. The research received
approval from the university’s institutional review board.
Guidelines provided by Kelley et al [10] were used for
designing, conducting, and reporting this survey research.
Participants were recruited from the student population. This
university closed all campuses on March 23, 2020, and held all
classes virtually in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In
addition, the State of Texas issued a stay-at-home order on April
2, 2020. The survey was published using the online survey
platform Qualtrics on May 4, 2020, and data collection remained
open until no additional completion was reported for two days
(May 19, 2020). During this period, the survey was announced
to the entire population of over 60,000 students at the Texas
A&M College Station Campus, through email.
Survey Design
The survey was designed in a semistructured format comprising
multiple-choice questions and free-text fields for elaboration.
The survey consisted of the following five sections:
Demographics
This section included questions related to participants’ age,
gender, college classification (ie, undergraduate [freshman,
sophomore, junior, senior] or graduate [master’s, doctorate]),
and program of study.
Patient Health Questionnaire
The PHQ-9 is a validated and widely used measure of depression
severity in primary and mental health care, consisting of 9 items
based on depression symptoms. Respondents report the
frequency of symptoms experienced within the last 2 weeks.
The categories of severity range are minimal (0-4), mild (5-9),
moderate (10-14), moderately severe (15-19), and severe (20-27)
[11].
Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener
The GAD-7 is a validated questionnaire used in most mental
health care settings as a screening tool for major anxiety
disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder
[12], consisting of 7 items based on GAD symptoms.
Respondents rate the frequency of experiencing these symptoms
within the last 2 weeks. The categories of severity range are
minimal (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10-14), and severe (15-21).
Questions Related to COVID-19–Related Stress
This section aimed at identifying various stressors resulting
from the pandemic and comprised the following items:
• Did your overall stress increase/decrease or remain the same
during the ongoing pandemic? (response:
increase/decrease/remain the same)
• If the participant chose increase/decrease, a follow-up
open-answer question was asked: Can you describe the
main reason for such increase/decrease of stress and
anxiety?
• Do you think other students are experiencing stress/anxiety
because of the pandemic? (response: yes/no)
• In the past month, what level of fear, worry, and/or changes
have you experienced related to any of the following
academic/health/lifestyle-related concerns? (response:
none/mild/moderate/severe)
• Did you have any other academic/health/lifestyle-related
concerns? (response: yes/no)
• If participant chose “yes,” a follow-up open-answer
question was asked: Please specify any other
academic-related concerns you have.
Coping Mechanisms and Barriers
This section consisted of multiple-choice questions and
open-ended follow-up questions related to ways in which the
students coped with stress during the pandemic. Follow-up
questions were included to identify specific resources and
technological apps that students may have been using as they
coped:
• Do you feel you are able to cope adequately with the stress
related to the current situation? (response: yes/no/maybe)
• What coping methods/tools/techniques have you used to
mitigate your elevated stress/anxiety? (response: none;

university services; health services outside the university;
support from community, family and friends; technologies;
other)
• If participant chose “university services,” a follow-up
question was asked: What university services did you
use because of the pandemic? (response: student health
services; counseling and psychological services; other)
• Where are you sourcing your information [about the
pandemic] from? (response: university emails; your medical
provider; newspaper and periodicals; medical websites;
posts on social media; other)
• Have you been using any mobile apps or features on
existing apps for managing stress, anxiety, or depression
related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic? (response:
yes/no)
• If participant chose “yes,” a follow-up open-answer
question was asked: Please specify what apps/features
you have been using.
• In your opinion, what are the barriers to mental health care?
(response: none; lack of information about resources
available; financial concerns; limited access to the services;
social stigma; other)
Data Analysis
For PHQ-9 and GAD-7, mean scores were calculated for
different gender and classification groups. The percentages of
participants who fall in each severity category were computed.
Inspection of the data and residual plots for mean PHQ-9 and
GAD-7 scores did not indicate any violation of assumptions of
normality, independence, and homogeneity of variance.
Therefore, a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
conducted to identify significant main effects and interactions
between gender and classification groups. For the questions
regarding concerns about COVID-19, the percentage of
participants who chose each severity level was computed. For
the multiple-choice questions regarding coping mechanisms
and barriers, the percentage of participants who chose each item
was computed. Quantitative analyses were performed using
Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp) and R 4.0.2 (The R
Foundation).
Open-ended questions were coded using thematic analysis [13].
Initial codes were created based on a previous coding scheme
used for an interview study [14]. Initial coding consisted of
placing all responses to the questions into the initial codes;
however, responses that did not fit in the initial codes were
placed in new codes generated inductively. Focused coding,
following initial coding, consisted of recategorizing codes and
creating additional codes as needed. For the final phase of
thematic coding, common themes were identified among the
codes and numbers of appearance were counted. The analysis
of the open-ended questions was split among four coders: one
coder analyzed the questions related to increased or decreased
stress (BK); one coder analyzed the questions related to
academic concerns (CS); one coder analyzed questions related
to health and lifestyle (XW); and one coder analyzed questions
related to coping mechanisms and barriers to treatment (AS).
Between each phase of coding, the coders and other authors
(SH and FS) met and discussed their process to ensure a uniform
analysis method. The final coding structure and themes were
decided upon in consensus meetings among all authors.
Qualitative analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel
(Microsoft Corp) and MAXQDA (VERBI Software) [15].

Severity of Depression and Anxiety
Depression
A total of 37 responses were excluded from the PHQ-9
questionnaire analysis because of missing values. Among the
1994 complete responses, 1607 (80.57%) participants reported
some (any) level of depression, as follows: mild (n=647,
32.45%), moderate (n=496, 24.87%), moderately severe (n=316,
15.85%), and severe (n=148, 7.42%). The two-way ANOVA
showed that gender (P<.001, η
2
=0.03) and classification
(P<.001, η
2
=0.03) significantly impacted PHQ-9 scores.
Females had a mean score of 1.76 points higher than males
(mean 10.61 and 8.84, respectively). Participants with a higher
classification had lower PHQ-9 scores (Figure 1). Tukey’s
honest significant difference (HSD) showed a significant
difference between doctoral and all undergraduate classifications
(P<.001, P<.001, P<.001, and P=.001, respectively), between
master’s and freshman/sophomore/junior (P<.001, P<.001, and
P=.04, respectively), and between senior and freshman (P=.004).

Responses to item 9 of the PHQ-9 (“over the last two weeks,
how often have you been bothered by thoughts that you would
be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way?”) showed
that 366 (18.04%) participants had thoughts related to self-harm
or suicide (250 responded “several days,” 74 “more than half
the days,” and 42 “nearly every day”).
Anxiety
In total, 17 responses were excluded from the GAD-7
questionnaire analysis because of missing values. Among the
2014 complete responses, 569 (28.25%) participants reported
minimal anxiety, while 71.75% (n=1445) showed anxiety, with
severity levels varying as mild (n=670, 33.27%), moderate
(n=477, 23.68%), or severe (n=298, 14.80%). The two-way
ANOVA showed a significant main effect of gender (P<.001,
η
2
=0.05) and classification (P<.001, η
2
=0.02) on GAD-7 score.
Females had a mean score of 2.22 points higher than males
(means scores were 9.12 and 6.89, respectively). Participants
with a higher classification had lower GAD-7 scores (Figure
2). Tukey’s HSD test was conducted to test for differences
between the classifications, and showed a significant difference
between doctoral and all undergraduate classifications (P<.001,
P<.001, P=.002, and P=.002, respectively), and between
master’s and sophomore (P=.03).

COVID-19–Related Stress
A majority of participants (n=1443, 71.26%) reported that their
stress/anxiety levels had increased during the pandemic, while
111 (5.48%) indicated it had decreased and 471 (23.26%)
indicated it remained the same as before. A vast majority
(n=1982, 97.83%) of students thought other students were
experiencing stress/anxiety because of the pandemic.
Participants who indicated a change in their stress/anxiety levels
were asked to specify reasons for such an increase or decrease
in a follow-up question. Apart from the general comments on
the stressors, participants also rated severity of the effect by
specific academic-, health-, and lifestyle-related concerns.
Reasons for Increase in Stress
Among the participants who indicated increased stress/anxiety
(n=1443) during the pandemic, 1360 participants elaborated on
the reasons for such an increase. The biggest contributor was
stress related to academics (532/1360, 39.12%), with the
majority stemming from increased difficulty (n=278) due to the
precipitous transition and maintenance of online classes,
distantly followed by increased concerns over grades (n=58),
and delayed graduation (n=53). The second most frequent
contributor was general uncertainty regarding the pandemic
(473/1360, 34.78%). This was followed by health concerns
(472/1360, 34.71%) relating to personal mental health (n=205),
health of friends and family (n=162), and fear of personally
contracting COVID-19 (n=83). The fourth biggest concern
related to finances (279/1360, 20.51%), primarily stemming
from unemployment or uncertainty of future employment
(n=183). Living/work environment (276/1360, 20.29%) was
the next biggest contributor, consisting of concerns related to
working from home (n=79), cabin fever (n=59), returning home
(n=49), and confinement with others (n=47). Impacted social
life (252/1360, 18.53%) was the last major category, primarily
consisting of concerns related to isolation (n=186).
Reasons for Decrease in Stress
A few respondents (n=109) elaborated on the reasons that they
were experiencing decreased stress and anxiety during the
pandemic. The majority of these respondents mentioned that
this was due to time saved (47/109, 43.1%) as a result of not
having to commute to school, reduced schoolwork, and not
having to engage in extracurricular and organizational activities,
which are otherwise a part of campus life. A key benefit of the
transition to distance learning was the schedule flexibility
(n=20), particularly when lecture recordings could be viewed
on students’ own time. Several students (n=13) also mentioned
using the additional time available to pursue hobbies and other
interests, as well as to amplify proactive health behaviors such
as meditation and exercise. Interestingly, some students (n=8)
reported that they were experiencing reduced social anxiety
from not having to interact with other students.
Academic-Related Concerns
In terms of academic-related concerns (Figure 3), 1851 (90.74%)
participants had difficulty in concentrating, with 716 (35.10%)
rating their difficulty as moderate and 706 (34.61%) as severe.
Similarly, most participants had concerns regarding their
academic progress and future plans (n=1830, 89.57%), as well
as academic performance (n=1752, 85.71%). A majority of the
participants also had difficulty adapting to distance learning
(n=1554, 76.03%) or had an increased class workload (n=1358,
66.57%).
Figure 3. Academic-related concerns.
A small portion of participants (n=389) provided additional
free-response reasons behind the increased level of stress related
to academics. Nearly one fifth of those who indicated such
reasons (73/389, 18.8%) reported financial concerns related to
their academic situations such as reduced current and
prospective job opportunities (n=42), increased burden to pay
tuition and fees (n=16), and impacts on scholarship and funding
(n=15). Some of the participants (27/389, 6.9%) presented their
worry about future semesters, such as continuing online classes
in following semesters (n=12), choosing a major in the middle
of the pandemic situation (n=10), and resuming in-person classes
with persistent risks of virus infection (n=5).
Health-Related Concerns
As Figure 4 shows, the top health-related concern was fear and
worry about personal health and the health of loved ones
(n=1825, 89.24%), followed by changes in sleeping habits
(n=1735, 84.92%), eating patterns (n=1641, 80.44%), and
depressive thoughts (n=1362, 66.67%).

Figure 4. Health-related concerns.
Some participants (n=180) added health-related concerns in the
free responses. The biggest concern was physical illness (52/180,
29.9%), including having physical illness (n=31) that worsened
during the pandemic (n=6). Some were at higher risk of getting
infected with COVID-19 due to asthma (n=9), autoimmune
disease (n=4), being immunocompromised (n=3) or other disease
(n=3). Four participants reported that they have been infected
with COVID-19. Fitness was another concern (49/180, 28.2%),
including decreased exercise (n=45), weight gain (n=12), and
muscle/back pain due to sedentary lifestyle (n=5). Some
participants reported having been diagnosed with mental illness
(n=31), which worsened during the pandemic (n=11). Barriers
to health care were mentioned by 29 participants, including
barriers or reluctance to visit doctors for nonpandemic issues
(n=24), barriers to get medication (n=3), and barriers to get
tested for COVID-19 (n=2).
Lifestyle-Related Concerns
More than half of the participants reported experiencing the top
seven lifestyle concerns shown in Figure 5. It was not surprising
that “changes to social relations or social isolation” (n=1775,
86.80%) and “social/physical distancing” (n=1741, 85.43%)
were the top two lifestyle concerns.
Figure 5. Lifestyle-related concerns.
Some participants (n=174) mentioned additional concerns
related to lifestyle changes in the free responses. The major
concern was relationship (71/174, 40.8%), including social
activities affected by isolation (n=45) and relationship issues
with family members (n=18) and roommates (n=8). Some
participants had difficulty working (n=17), due to unsatisfying
work environments (n=9) such as internet issues (n=2), or had
difficulty following a schedule (n=8). Other concerns included
uncertainty of the future (n=12), worry because others do not
perform social distancing (n=11), and worry of bringing the
virus to their family as essential workers (n=2).
Coping Mechanisms and Barriers
Coping Mechanisms
Nearly half (n=882, 43.25%) of the participants indicated via
multiple-choice responses that they were able to cope adequately
with the stress related to the current situation, while 323
(15.84%) said they were not able to cope. The rest were unsure
(n=834, 40.90%). When asked what coping mechanisms were
used to mitigate stress/anxiety, more than half (n=1362, 67.06%)
of the participants chose “support from community, family and
friends,” followed by “technologies (websites, mobile apps,
sensors that help monitor health data)” (n=659, 32.45%). Few
participants reported using university health services such as
counseling service (n=210, 10.34%) or health services outside
the university (n=89, 4.38%). Some of the participants (n=387,
19.05%) reported using no coping mechanism.
Some respondents (n=386) indicated that they used other coping
mechanisms to reduce stress during the COVID-19 and provided
elaboration in the free-response field. Many of these respondents
(152/386, 39.0%) mentioned engaging in health lifestyle
activities such as exercise (n=130), diet maintenance (n=11),

and self-care activities (n=11). A similar number of respondents
(143/386, 37.1%) engaged in relaxing activities including
meditation (n=48), reading (n=21), playing with pets (n=13),
listening to music (n=12), breathing exercises (n=4), sleeping
(n=3), shooting for sport (n=2), gardening (n=1), and other
hobbies in general (n=29) alongside general relaxing activities
(n=10). Beyond relaxing activities, some respondents engaged
in creative activities (31/386, 8.0%), which included creating
pieces of art (n=10), writing (n=18), and playing musical
instruments (n=3). Additionally, respondents mentioned
engaging in spiritual and religious activities (n=69) such as
reading sacred texts and praying. A small percentage of the
respondents also engaged in negative coping methods (41/386,
10.6%), including distracting themselves (n=20), excessive
intake of alcohol (n=5), isolation (n=2), auto-manipulation
(n=2), and crying (n=1). Lastly, some respondents maintained
focus on their work and professional activities (16/386, 4.2%)
by concentrating on school (n=4), continuing work (n=3), or
managing their time for productive use.
Smartphone Apps for Coping With COVID-19
A small number of participants (n=290, 14.28%) indicated that
they have been using mobile apps for managing added stress
related to the pandemic, 278 of whom provided specific names
of the apps or features. Most of these respondents (201/278,
72.3%) used an app focused on mindfulness. Most of these
mindfulness apps focused on meditation (144), such as
Headspace; relaxation apps (n=42) and apps centered on focused
breathing (n=15) were also used. Social media (46/278, 16.5%)
was used by some of the respondents with most using the typical
social media sites (eg, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and
TikTok) and apps (n=32) for entertainment purposes while
others used YouTube (n=14). Some respondents used lifestyle
apps (37/278, 13.3%), including exercise apps (n=23), time
management (n=9), sleep tracking (n=5), and food tracking
(n=2). A small number of respondents (6/278, 2.2%) played
video game apps to cope with stress during COVID-19.
Sources of Information for COVID-19
The main sources of information related to the pandemic were
university emails (n=1257, 61.89%), newspapers, paper or online
periodicals (n=1221, 60.12%), and posts on social media
(n=1026, 50.52%). Some participants also received information
from medical websites (n=591, 29.10%) or their medical
providers (n=315, 15.51%).
A small number of respondents (n=235) elaborated on the other
information sources in open-ended responses. About a quarter
(60/235, 25.5%) of these respondents received their information
from more traditional media including television (n=34), online
articles (n=19), and the radio (n=7). A similar number of
participants (55/235, 23.4%) received their information from
family and friends. Other respondents listened to figures of
authority (50/235, 21.3%) for their information regarding
COVID-19, split between government officials and
organizations, including presidential briefings and local leaders
(n=32) on one hand, and prominent scientists and researchers
(n=28) on the other. Finally, some respondents preferred to rely
on themselves to stay informed (21/235, 8.9%) by conducting
searches and reading relevant sources (n=4), or by ignoring the
news due to disbelief in or indifference toward the current
situation (n=17).
Barriers for Mental Health Care
The major barriers to mental health care were “financial
concerns (fees and insurance)” (n=1434, 70.61%), “social
stigma” (n=1194, 58.79%), “lack of information about resources
available” (n=1099, 54.11%), and “limited access to the services
(eg, could not get scheduled)” (n=978, 48.15%).
A few respondents (n=167) indicated that they experienced
other barriers and elaborated through the free-response section.
Some of the respondents perceived that they themselves (69/167,
41.3%) can be the biggest barrier to reaching out for help: some
doubted the efficacy of care (n=8); some mentioned that they
or others may not see a problem even if it exists (n=22); others
mentioned not wanting help (n=7). Respondents cited an overall
feeling of discomfort (25/167, 15.0%) with the topic of mental
health and difficulty bringing up the topic with others. Some of
the respondents mentioned poor quality (22/167, 13.2%) in their
treatment as a barrier to seeking treatment again.
Discussion
Principal Findings
Among the 2031 participants, 48.14% showed a
moderate-to-severe level of depression, 38.48% showed a
mild-to-severe level of anxiety, and 18.04% had suicidal
thoughts in the 2 weeks preceding the survey. Gender and
classification had significant effects on depression and anxiety
severity (P<.001). Female respondents reported higher scores,
while respondents in a higher classification reported lower
scores on PHQ-9 and GAD-7. A majority of participants
(71.26%) indicated that their stress/anxiety levels had increased
during the pandemic. Less than half (43.25%) indicated that
they were able to cope adequately with the stress related to the
current situation.
The survey had a healthy representation across genders and
classifications of undergraduate and graduate students. A vast
majority (80.57%) of respondents had scores on the PHQ-9 that
indicated some level of depression (defined as a total PHQ-9
score of ≥5), with about 48% in the moderate-to-severe range.
This proportion of respondents showing depression is much
larger than those found in recent assessments in China. For
instance, in their survey of 509 college students, Liu et al [16]
found that about 19% of their respondents showed some level
of depression. Our findings also show a higher proportion of
respondents with depressive symptoms among students than
findings in several recent studies in nonpandemic situations
[17,18]. Furthermore, nearly 1 in 5 respondents reported having
suicidal thoughts. This finding is in line with the increased
suicide rates observed during previous pandemics [19]. In
comparison, previous research has reported about 3% to 7% of
the college student population had suicidal thoughts outside of
a pandemic situation [20]. This is an alarming finding warranting
immediate attention. Additionally, a majority of our respondents
(71.75%) showed some level of anxiety (defined as a total
GAD-7 score of ≥5), with over 38% in the moderate-to-severe
range. Again, this is a much higher proportion compared to

similar survey-based assessments by Liu et al [16] and Cao et
al [9], who found some level of anxiety in 8.8% (out of 509)
and 24.9% (out of 7143) of respondents, respectively. Clearly,
there is a pressing need to actively provide support to vulnerable
students in managing their mental health.
Not surprisingly, given the above findings, a majority of
respondents reported that their stress and anxiety had increased
during the pandemic. In general, this is consistent with the
heightened levels of psychological distress reported among
various populations during the current pandemic and previous
epidemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
[6,7,9,21]. This finding could be underpinned by the high levels
of academic, health, and lifestyle concerns and changes. A vast
majority indicated difficulty concentrating, fear, and worry
about academic progress and performance, and adjustment to
distance learning as dominant academic concerns. To our
knowledge, this is the first study that reports these specific
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic as related to academic
concerns. Given that several universities, including Texas A&M,
are continuing partially with distance learning for the remainder
of the year, these concerns need to be probed further in order
to be adequately addressed.
Among health-related concerns, a majority of students expressed
concerns about their own health or the health of loved ones,
echoing recent findings [6]. A large proportion (over 80%) of
respondents reported changes in eating and sleeping habits.
Again, this is not surprising, but certainly concerning, given
previous research which has shown that such changes are
correlated with depression among college students [22]. Among
lifestyle-related concerns, physical distancing and changes in
social relations were widely reported, similar to those found
earlier among students as well as the general population [6,23].
Additionally, three quarters of respondents indicated fear and
worry induced by news outlets. This type of distress may be
exacerbated by the large amount of misinformation, including
false and fabricated information, distributed through news and
social media platforms [24].
More than half the respondents who described coping
mechanisms mentioned support from family and friends as a
key factor, similar to previous findings [6,9]. Several
respondents also mentioned the use of technology, such as
mobile apps and other digital platforms, as a means of positive
coping practices, such as meditation, echoing recent findings
on the positive effect of a mindfulness app on college students’
mental health [25]. This indicates some potential for
mobile-based technologies to support mental health. Such
platforms may have the added benefit of helping overcome the
barrier of social stigma related to seeking help from counseling
services. Identifying such positive coping behaviors is important
in order to enable those behaviors through symptoms-level
support.
Limitations and Future Work
Several limitations may impact the generalizability of the
findings reported in this paper. Most importantly, some of our
findings may be biased due to self-selection by respondents.
The higher percentage of respondents with depression/anxiety
may be related to this bias. Particularly, the slightly higher level
of depression/anxiety among females may be attributed to the
slightly higher percentage of female respondents. Additionally,
we did not ask if respondents had any existing mental health
issues or were receiving treatment before the pandemic. In fact,
31 respondents mentioned on their own that they had a prior
diagnosis of mental illness. Therefore, we are unable to clarify
whether our findings have been biased by a population of
respondents with pre-existing or heightened levels of distress,
who may have been more inclined to participate in the survey
than those who were less distressed.
The survey is cross-sectional and lacks comparison to a typical
semester unaffected by the pandemic, or a different time point
of the year. Huckins et al [26] tracked depression and anxiety
severity of 217 undergraduate students using PHQ-4 and GAD-2
during Spring 2020. It was found that depression and anxiety
levels spiked when the campus switched to remote learning but
decreased in the following 2 weeks. It is valuable to keep
monitoring the change to understand the long-term effect of the
pandemic.
An interesting finding is the differences in depression/anxiety
levels among different classifications of students. Undergraduate
students may have been more heavily impacted during the
pandemic compared to graduate students, probably from
adapting to distance learning. Yet the precise factors need further
investigation in a future study.
The proportion of respondents showing depression, anxiety,
and/or suicidal thoughts is alarming. Respondents reported
academic, health, and lifestyle-related concerns caused by the
pandemic. Given the unexpected length and severity of the
pandemic, these concerns need to be further understood and
addressed. Further study on the most at-risk populations and
evidence-based interventions should proceed as soon as possible
to prevent a secondary epidemic, embedded within the
COVID-19 pandemic, of a serious, nationwide mental affliction
and potential physical self-harm among vulnerable college
students.
At an institutional level, online remote activities and services
can be implemented to provide support to students that help
address concerns related to the pandemic. For example,
Schlesselman et al [27] provided a list of activities that can
potentially support students in fitness, socialization, and
academic success (eg, virtual group exercise, virtual movie
night, and virtual office hours). However, there is no
one-size-fits-all solution. More work is needed to identify
appropriate ways to implement such support and assess the
long-term effects of such interventions.
