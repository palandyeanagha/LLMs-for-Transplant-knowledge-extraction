Abstract
Introduction: Producing smart offspring is an important fitness trait; individuals with enhanced cognitive ability
should be more adept at responding to complex environmental demands. Cognitive ability can be influenced by
conditions experienced during embryonic development. Although oxygen is necessary for embryonic development,
availability can be limited within the nest environment because of substrate type, hydric conditions, and
temperature. We do not yet understand, however, whether oxygen availability during embryonic development
influences offspring fitness, especially cognitive ability. To address this question we incubated Mongolian
Racerunner lizard (Eremias argus) eggs under hypoxic (12% O2), normoxic (21% O2), and hyperoxic conditions
(30% O2).
Results: Hypoxia not only slowed hatching time, but also resulted in constrained cognitive ability relative to
hatchlings experiencing normoxic or hyperoxic incubation conditions. Oxygen did not influence hatching success,
body size or sprint speed of hatchlings.
Conclusions: Oxygen availability during embryonic development has important influences on incubation duration
and cognitive ability of hatchling lizards. This study provides the first evidence that oxygen availability during
embryonic development can modify cognitive ability of oviparous reptiles.

Introduction
During embryonic development the phenotype is integrated
through a combination of genetic, maternal and environ￾mental effects (reviewed by [1,2]). The incubation environ￾ment of oviparous species, in which the embryos develop
outside of the mother’s body, can vary substantially depen￾ding on the nest environment selected and whether or
not parental care is provided [1-3]. Attributes such as the
thermal and hydric conditions during incubation can have
profound effects on hatchling morphology, locomotion,
growth and survival [3-5]. Despite a broad understanding
of how attributes of the nest environment influence off￾spring morphology and performance (e.g., sprint speed), we
know much less about whether the primary drivers of
embryonic development influence cognition and behaviour,
and how they work.
Cognitive ability is a flexible behavioural trait that can
be modified by the incubation environment [6,7]. Naïve
animals, such as those emerging from eggs, must be able
to learn about the complex environment efficiently; for
example, the ability to locate safe retreat sites to protect
against potential predators or unfavourable microenvi￾ronments [8]. Individuals with enhanced cognitive ability
may be able to respond more adaptively to complex, and
sometimes novel, environmental demands [7,9], which
may result in strong selective pressure for individuals
that are able to quickly evaluate and respond to eco￾logical challenges.
Oxygen is an essential environmental factor required
for embryonic development, which oviparous species ob￾tain from the nest environment by diffusion through the
eggshell [10-12]. Oxygen availability within natural nests
can vary significantly due to metabolic activities of mi￾crobes and consumption of oxygen by other incubating

eggs [13,14]. For example, in green sea turtle nests, oxy￾gen partial pressure declines significantly towards the
end of incubation, as developing embryos grow larger
[15]. The oxygen concentration experienced during em￾bryonic development can have profound impacts on
hatchling morphology, growth and metabolic rates, as
has been demonstrated in alligators (Alligator mississip￾piensis) [12]. How oxygen influences other fitness deter￾minants, such as cognition, is still unknown.
We incubated Mongolian Racerunner lizard (Eremias
argus) eggs under different oxygen concentrations, and
examined the consequences on hatchling phenotype and
cognitive ability. Mongolian Racerunners have small
home ranges in nature, and when confronted with po￾tential threats individuals escape into safe retreat sites
[16]. Spatial cognition of safe retreat sites (from preda￾tors, unfavourable conditions, etc.) is thus likely to be an
important fitness trait [8]. By manipulating oxygen avail￾ability during egg incubation, we aim to elucidate the
direct consequences on the cognitive ability of hatchling
lizards.
Results
Initial egg mass did not differ significantly among oxygen
treatments (Table 1). Incubation duration was significantly
shorter under hyperoxic conditions, but oxygen did not
significantly influence hatching success, body size, or sur￾vival (Table 1).
Both oxygen concentration and timing of testing signi￾ficantly influenced learning processes (Table 2; with an
Independent working correlation matrix, Table 3). The es￾cape probability of lizards incubated under hyperoxic con￾dition was significantly higher than hypoxic condition, but
was not different from normoxic incubation treatment
(Figure 1a; Table 4). As our cognitive testing progressed,
the escape probabilities decreased in those lizards that were
incubated under hypoxic conditions (B = -0.126, R2 = 0.101
χ
2 = 11.668, df = 1, p = 0.001), but were enhanced in lizards
under hyperoxic environments (B = 0.093, R2 = 0.052 χ
2 =
6.312, df = 1, p = 0.012), and did not change in lizards under
the normoxic conditions (p = 0.457) (Figure 1a). The num￾ber of errors that hatchling lizards made was significantly
influenced by both oxygen concentration and timing of
testing (Table 2; with Independent working correlation
matrix, Table 3). Lizards incubated under hyperoxic condi￾tions made fewer errors than those incubated under hyp￾oxic conditions, but did not differ from the normoxic
conditions (Figure 1b; Table 4). The error rates did not
change during learning processes in any of the treatments
(low oxygen, p = 0.738; normal oxygen, p = 0.381; high oxy￾gen, p = 0.093) (Figure 1b). We found no significant differ￾ences between the sexes in their escape probability or error
rates (Table 2).
Discussion
Using established methods in our spatial cognitive tests [7],
lizards should demonstrate learning by two metrics: both
increased escape probability and decreased errors over 16
consecutive tests. Oxygen availability during incubation sig￾nificantly influenced escape probability, but did not signifi￾cantly influence the errors rates of hatchling Racerunner
lizards over the tests (Figure 1; Table 4). Locating safe re￾treat sites is an important fitness trait, because individuals
escape into safe retreat sites when confronted with poten￾tial threats [8,16]. Despite the lizards incubated under
hyperoxic conditions making fewer errors than lizards
under hypoxic environments, the spatial learning results
are equivocal because errors rates did not vary temporally
within any oxygen treatment. Therefore, this may reflect a
learning outcome rather than spatial learning process.
Mammals and birds can strategically locate specific goals,
evidence of spatial learning [17]. In the squamates, however,
some species navigate using beacons, whereas others use
trial-and-error searching [18,19]. For hatchling lizards,

goal-oriented tasks may be most relevant to immediate fit￾ness (i.e. locating safe retreat sites, as tested in this study)
and thus understanding whether these patterns are due to
associative or spatial learning is not as important [20]. Al￾though we were unable to confirm the learning strategy
used by lizards, we demonstrate an increase in escape prob￾ability over consecutive tests in lizards incubated under
hyperoxic conditions. Oxygen is widely known to influence
the cognitive abilities of mammals [21,22], and our study
provides the first evidence that oxygen can modify cognitive
ability, and thus fitness, in oviparous reptiles.
Hatchling lizards incubated under hypoxic environ￾ments did not increase their escape probability; instead,
these lizards decreased their probability of successfully
locating the open retreat and constantly made high error
rates across tests (Figure 1a,b). Nevertheless, the
temperature-dependent physiology of Mongolian Racer￾unners [23] may allow some hatchlings to compensate
for reduced cognition by maintaining higher body tem￾peratures, potentially overcoming an intrinsically weak
ability to learn the location of safe retreats by increasing
escape speed when confronted with potential threats [7].
The mechanism of how oxygen concentration influences
cognition is unclear, although brain size and brain structure
may be responsible for these differences [24,25]. For ex￾ample, avian hippocampus size is correlated with spatial
learning ability [26] and experience [27]. By comparison,
reptiles do not have hippocampus, however the medial cor￾tex is assumed as a homologue [17]. Larger brains may be
better able to deal with environmental challenges, such as
successfully colonizing novel habitats after undergoing hu￾man translocation [9]. Oxygen availability can also influ￾ence hormone levels during brain development, potentially
modifying memory retention or learning ability [28,29].
Embryonic development of oviparous reptiles is positively
related to metabolic rates, suggesting that aerobic metabol￾ism could be another cause [12,30]. Hypoxia during incuba￾tion may impose restrictions on brain development
through embryonic metabolic pneumatorexis [e.g., 31],
thereby limiting brain size development or brain structure
formation.
Enhanced cognitive ability may increase survival rates
and reproductive success by facilitating adaptive responses
in complex environments [7]. Because hatchlings are ex￾tremely vulnerable to predation [32], natural selection
should favour rapid learning of safe retreat sites very early
in life. Individuals that take longer to select safe retreats or
find suboptimal sites may suffer increased predation. Fur￾ther work integrating multiple aspects of the incubation en￾vironment (e.g., oxygen and temperature/moisture) will
provide greater insight into the main factors driving the or￾ganismal phenotype, including cognition.
Conclusions
We investigated the effects of oxygen availability during
embryonic development on the cognitive ability of
hatchling lizards and showed that increased oxygen
levels during incubation enhanced cognition. Our study
provides the first evidence that oxygen can modify cog￾nitive ability in oviparous reptiles, and highlights the
neglected importance that developmental oxygen can
have on animals after hatching from the egg.

a 14L:10D photoperiod at 24 ± 1°C. Supplemental heat￾ing was available from 0800 to 1600 hours. Food
(crickets dusted with vitamin supplements) and water
were available ad libitum.
We checked terraria 4 times daily for freshly laid eggs.
Eggs were collected between 14-22 June and the col￾lected eggs were weighed (±0.001 g) immediately to
minimize initial mass changes due to water exchange.
Although the clutch size of female E. argus ranges from
two to five [16], we only used one egg from each clutch
in this study to eliminate genetic effects. We randomly
allocated a single egg from 55 females into hyperoxic
(30% O2: n = 18 eggs), normoxic (21% O2: n = 20), or
hypoxic (12% O2: n = 17) incubation conditions. Eggs
were incubated at 28 ± 0.5°C with 6-8 eggs placed inside
a vermiculite-filled container (-220kpa) which was sealed
inside a 40L vacuum bag filled with compressed oxygen
and nitrogen [12]. Air was renewed every second day to
maintain incubation conditions ± 2% of desired.
Towards the end of incubation, we checked the con￾tainers twice daily (every morning and evening) for new
hatchlings. Hatchling lizards were individually identified,
sexed by eversion of the hemipenes, measured (SVL to
0.01 mm, body mass to 0.01 g) and randomly allocated
to seven terraria (600 × 450 × 340 mm, 20 mm sand sub￾strate). Each terrarium contained two hides spaced 550
mm apart (inverted 90 mm diameter flower-pot trays,
with an entrance 50 mm wide). The entrance of one hide
was covered with a transparent film to prevent hatch￾lings’ access to one hide, but not the other (Figure 2).
Because familiar environments can facilitate spatial cog￾nition of reptiles [8], we set up the hides in the same po￾sitions in all seven terraria throughout the experiment
[7]. Hatchlings (6-7/terrarium) were maintained under
normoxic conditions (photoperiod 14L: 10D at 30 ± 1°C)
with food and water available ad libitum (Figure 2).
We quantified locomotor performance (sprint speed)
of hatchling lizards roughly 30 days after hatching (lizard
range in age: 29-32 days) by racing each hatchling down
a 100cm racetrack (marked at 20cm intervals), encour￾aged with a soft paintbrush. Individuals were raced three
times each at 30 ± 1°C, with 1h of rest between each

consecutive race. For each individual we averaged the
fastest 20cm from each of the three races to quantify
locomotor performance.
We then tested the cognitive abilities of hatchling
lizards in the terrarium where they were fed [8,33]
(Figure 2), using established methods [7]. Each lizard was
tested individually four times daily for four consecutive days
(n = 16 tests/lizard). For each test, we removed food, water
and all individuals from the cage, and then placed an indi￾vidual lizard beneath an opaque container located halfway
between the two potential hides in its home cage. After 30
seconds, we lifted the container and stimulated the hatch￾ling to run by tapping its tail with a paintbrush. A lizard
successfully escaped if it fled into the open retreat within
30 seconds; any attempts to enter the closed shelter were
scored as errors. If an individual was not successful within
120 seconds, it was placed inside the open retreat for 60
seconds and the test terminated. We mixed the sand sub￾strate between each test, and lizards were maintained in
their communal cage between tests. We used learning
ability to assess cognition of hatchling lizards, defined
as an increase in the probability of successfully escaping
over tests.
We compared differences in hatching success and
hatchling survival (to 30 d) among incubation regimes
using chi-square tests. We used one-way ANOVAs to
compare body size (SVL; at both hatching and at 30 d,
when testing occurred) among oxygen treatments. To
compare differences in initial egg mass, body mass at
hatching and body mass at 30d among oxygen treat￾ments; we used one-way ANCOVAs with SVL of fe￾males, initial egg mass and hatchling body mass as the
covariates, respectively. To assess learning ability, we
employed Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) to
test whether oxygen treatment and sex predicted the es￾cape outcome (1 = successfully escaped; 0 = failed to es￾cape) over 16 consecutive tests, with SVL and locomotor
speed as covariates. We also conducted GEE to test

whether oxygen treatment and sex determined the num￾ber of errors lizards made across trials, with SVL and
locomotor speed as covariates. We selected the hyper￾oxic treatment group as the focal subject for analysis.
We selected the model with the best fit, according to
quasi-likelihood under the independence model criterion
(QIC). The model with the lowest QICC value (corrected
QIC value) was considered to provide the best explanation
of variance in the dependent variable. Finally, we used a
Logistic Regression to assess whether escape probabilities
and the number of errors made by individual lizards were
dependent upon the test processes. Prior to analysis of
variance, we checked the raw data for normality and
homogeneity of variances using Kolmogorov–Smirnov
and Levene’s tests. All variables met assumptions of
normality (all p > 0.109) and homogeneity of variance
(all p > 0.193). Means are ± S.E. and statistical signifi￾cance set at α = 0.05.
