SUMMARY This paper reports the incidence and natural history of macroscopic gastritis in a series
of 127 consecutive patients with portal hypertension of various aetiologies. Gastritis was
observed endoscopically in 65 patients (51%) and was of two main types. Twenty eight patients
had severe or persistent gastritis which caused clinically significant bleeding on 80 occasions and
accounted for 25% of the bleeds from all sources. The remainder had mild gastritis. The presence
of gastritis seemed to be independent of the severity of liver disease or the degree of rise of
wedged hepatic venous pressure and there was no difference in age, sex, or drugs prescribed in
patients with or without gastritis. The mean follow up period and the mean number of
sclerotherapy treatments was significantly greater (p<0.005) in patients with gastritis. Full
thickness gastric biopsies in seven surgical patients and 11 autopsy specimens showed dilated and
tortuous submucosal veins. Endoscopic biopsies in 14 patients showed vascular ectasia in the
mucosal layer which was in excess of the degree of inflammatory infiltrate. Gastritis occurred in
patients with portal hypertension of all common aetiologies and the clinical and pathological
evidence supports the contention that it reflects a congested gastric mucosa and should be
renamed congestive gastropathy. As injection sclerotherapy improves survival from variceal
bleeding congestive gastropathy may become more common. The response to conventional
('anti-erosive') therapy is poor and measures aimed at reducing the gastric portal pressure may be
the only effective means of treating this condition.
Gastric mucosal lesions are common in portal
hypertension. They are an important cause of blood
loss, which may be slow and insidious causing
anaemia,1 or sudden and severe, causing massive
and occasionally fatal haemorrhage.2 The use of
sclerotherapy for bleeding oesophageal varices com￾bined with regular endoscopic follow up has pro￾vided a unique opportunity to study the progression
of changes occurring in the gastric mucosa. We
report our clinical and endoscopic experience of
gastritis in portal hypertension over a four year
period.

mucosa were classified according to the description of
Taor et al.3 (i) a fine pink speckling or 'scarlatina'
type rash, (ii) a superficial reddening, particularly
on the surface of the rugae giving a striped
appearance, (iii) a fine white reticular pattern
separating areas of raised red oedematous mucosa
resembling a 'snake skin'.
These were included under the term 'mild gastri￾tis'.
During the course of the study two additional
forms of gastric mucosal changes were noted: (i)
discrete red spots analogous to the cherry red spots
described in the oesophagus. These spots can
become confluent giving a local area of severe
gastritis which may bleed, (ii) a diffuse haemorrha￾gic gastritis.
These were termed 'severe gastritis'.
Gastritis has been arbitrarily defined as 'transient'
if present at one endoscopy and resolved by the next
endoscopy six to eight weeks later. If gastritis was

present for more than eight weeks at two or more
consecutive endoscopies it was said to be 'persis￾tent'. Gastritis occurring within two weeks of
balloon tamponade was excluded as this could be
because of contact irritation.
Over the last four years (August 1979-August
1983) 127 patients with portal hypertension have
attended this unit. One hundred and fourteen
patients presented with bleeding and a further 13
had oesophageal varices with no clinical evidence of
haemorrhage. These were discovered during routine
evaluation of their portal hypertension. The pre￾sence or absence, and the degree of gastritis was
noted at each endoscopy. All patients were endo￾scoped at presentation by an experienced endoscop￾ist and any patient with upper gastrointestinal tract
bleeding underwent emergency endoscopy. Any
patients with oesophageal varices were treated by
injection sclerotherapy and followed up by regular
check endoscopies.
PATHOLOGY TECHNIQUE
Biopsies of the stomach were studied in 41 patients
with portal hypertension. These samples were
obtained (a) at endoscopy (23 patients - nine with
macroscopically normal mucosa and 14 with gastri￾tis), (b) during surgical procedures (seven patients -
four with bleeding gastritis and three with bleeding
gastric varices) and (c) at necropsy (11 patients).
Further operative samples were also taken during
refashioning of an ileostomy and at resection of an
oesophagojejunal anastomosis. Two patients with
duodenitis also had endoscopic biopsies taken.
Endoscopic biopsies and surgical specimens were
fixed by immersion in formal saline. Post mortem
specimens were fixed by gently filling the unopened
stomach and oesophagus with formal saline and
immersing the whole specimen in formal saline.
Paraffin sections were prepared and stained by
haematoxylin and eosin (H and E) or Miller's elastic
stain counterstained by van Gieson's stain for
collagen (EVG).

ENDOSCOPIC FINDINGS
Sixty five patients (51%) had macroscopic gastritis
at some stage during follow up. The changes were
most commonly seen in the fundus and body of the
stomach. There was no significant difference in age
or sex in patients with gastritis compared with the
rest (Table 1). Although there was a trend for
gastritis to be more frequent in patients with less
severe liver disease (as assessed by Child's grading)5
this did not reach statistical significance
(0-05<p<0-10). Gastritis occurred in portal

hypertension of all common aetiologies and the
proportion of patients who developed gastritis in
each of the aetiological groups was not significantly
different (X2 test).
Patients with gastritis had a significantly greater
(p<0-005) number of sclerotherapy treatments per
patient (mean 4-0±0-3 SE) than those without
gastritis (mean 2 3±0 2 SE). The follow up period in
patients with gastritis (mean 13-8 months ± 1.5 SE)
was also significantly greater (p<0.005) than in the
non-gastritis group (mean 6*7 months ± 1-2 SE).
Mild gastritis was noted in 37 of the 65 patients.
This was not of any clinical significance and in only
two patients did this progress to severe gastritis. On
the other hand severe gastritis led to clinical
bleeding in almost all instances (see below). Gastri￾tis both mild and severe was noted on initial
presentation in about one third of patients, and
developed during follow up in the remainder. The
age, sex, and Child's grading(s) was similar in
patients with mild transient gastritis and in those
with severe or persistent gastritis (Table 2), but both
the mean follow up period and the number of
sclerotherapy treatments were significantly greater
(p<0-0025 and p<0-005 respectively) in the pa￾tients with severe or persistent gastritis. The mean
number of treatments per patient month, however,
was similar in both groups.
BLEEDING
Clinically significant bleeding from gastritis occur￾red on 80 occasions in 29 patients, and blood
transfusion (2-15 units) was required for 60 bleeds.
Bleeds from gastritis accounted for 25% of the total
number of bleeds from all sources (Table 3).
Gastritis was responsible for only nine of 114

accounted for over one third of rebleeding episodes.
Fifty one bleeds from gastritis occurred in the
presence of thrombosed or obliterated oesophageal
varices. In the presence of patent oesophageal
varices, bleeding from gastritis was diagnosed only if
it -was seen to be coming from an area of gastritis and
no other source of haemorrhage was identifiable.

significant difference in the mean pressure in the 12
with gastritis (mean WHVP 17-3 mmHg ± 1P6 SE)
compared with those who had no gastritis (mean
WHVP 16*0 mmHg ± 1-6 SE).
RELATION OF MEDICATION TO GASTRITIS
Seventy patients were receiving diuretics, 11 pa￾tients penicillamine, six patients corticosteroids and
13 patients were being treated for diabetes. Patients
receiving these drugs were equally distributed be￾tween the gastritis and non-gastritis groups.
EFFECT OF SCLEROTHERAPY ON GASTRITIS
In six patients gastritis appeared for the first time
after successful sclerotherapy while in another five
patients the obliteration of oesophageal varices
appeared to coincide with the disapppearance of
gastritis.
PATHOLOGICAL CHANGES
The most consistent finding was dilatation of the
submucosal veins which were tortuous and irregular
in diameter. Elastic staining emphasised the irregu￾larity of the vein wall and showed foci of intimal
thickening (Fig. 1). These features were visible in
veins sampled from all areas of the stomach but
were particularly prominent in the proximal part of
the gastric body and cardia. The mucosal vessels
showed focal areas of abnormality. These consisted
of ectasia of capillaries and veins (Fig. 2) which at
times formed a leash of mucosal vessels. In some
cases this could be seen to overlie areas of abnormal
submucosal veins. Although chronic gastritis as
characterised by mononuclear infiltrate did occa￾sionally occur, the vascular changes were usually in
excess of that expected with the degree and activity
of gastritis. We have termed these changes 'conges￾tive gastropathy'.
In the jejunal and ileal surgical samples and
duodenal biopsies there was also marked vascular
ectasia in the mucosa, (Fig. 3) with no evidence of
an inflammatory infiltrate.
ENDOSCOPIC SPECIMENS
Biopsies were not done in endoscopically severe
gastritis for fear of inducing major haemorrhage.
Classic histological features of chronic inflammatory
gastritis were seen in four of 14 patients, while the
other 10 had vascular ectasia with little or no
inflammatory infiltrate. Six of the nine biopsies from
macroscopically normal mucosa were histologically
normal, the remainder showing vascular ectasia. It
should be remembered, however, that endoscopic
biopsies are of necessity small and superficial and
therefore liable to sampling error.

SURGICAL SPECIMENS
These were taken from patients with severe gastritis
or bleeding gastric varices and all showed mucosal
and submucosal vascular abnormalities.
AUTOPSY SPECIMENS
Marked submucosal vascular ectasia was seen in all
cases, but mucosal vascularity could not be assessed
because of mucosal post mortem autolysis.
The correlation between the macroscopic appear￾ances and histological findings are summarised in
Table 4.
Discussion
In this series, gastritis has been observed at some
time in 51% of patients with oesophageal varices
and it has been responsible for 25% of the total
number of bleeds. Other workers have noted that
bleeding in portal hypertension can be caused by
gastritis in 30-40% of cases.678 Gastric mucosal
changes were seen in portal hypertension of all
aetiologies and occurred in patients with both patent
and obliterated varices.
It should be emphasised that, with the exception
of the cherry red spots, the gastritis described here is
macroscopically identical to that seen in patients
without portal hypertension, but the histological
appearance is quite different from that described by

Gastropathy in portal hypertetnsion
Whitehead and colleagues9 where chronic inflam￾matory cells predominate and there is a strong
association with gastric ulcer. Our observations are
similar to that of Brown and colleagues'( who found
no evidence of an increased incidence of classical
chronic gastritis in a series of cirrhotics, despite the
presence of gastric ulcers and erosions in nearly 20%
of their patients. Furthermore, they comment that
gastric erosions tended to occur in histologically
normal mucosa. Their study, however, did not
include assessment of the mucosal and submucosal
vascular channels.
Gastritis in portal hypertension might be caused by
several factors. Alcohol can be excluded because we
have observed the changes in non-alcoholic cirrhosis
as frequently as in alcoholic cirrhosis. The observa￾tion of severe gastritis in two patients who had
undergone truncal vagotomies makes it unlikely that
gastric acid plays a major role.
The most important element causing gastritis may
be the raised portal pressure itself. Obstruction of
the venous drainage from the stomach can induce
changes in the gastric mucosa. Palmer, in 195711
induced portal hypertension in dogs by portal vein
ligation and found that both the mucosal and
submucosal veins in the stomach wall became
dilated. Both he and Sandblom'2 observed similar
changes in gastric biopsies from patients with portal
hypertension. Alternatively gastritis might be be￾cause of gastric mucosal ischaemia secondary to
arteriovenous shunting which can be demonstrated
in the stomachs of both animals13 and humans14 with
portal hypertension.
The histological changes are entirely consistent
with an increase in venous pressure producing a
congested gastric mucosa. The occurrence and
severity of this congestive gastropathy may depend,
however, not only on the total level of portal
pressure but also on local blood flow characteristics
which may or may not transmit this increased
pressure to the gastric mucosal and submucosal
veins. Differences in local blood flow patterns may
explain why some patients develop gastropathy and
others do not. Successful sclerotherapy of
oesophageal varices may induce local changes in
blood flow patterns and if this results in an increased
venous pressure in areas proximal to the site of
thrombosis, congestive gastropathy might be pre￾dicted.
The mean number of sclerotherapy treatments in
patients with gastropathy was significantly greater
than in those without it. Sclerotherapy appears to
increase long term survival15 and the greater inci￾dence of the gastric lesion in the longer survivors
may be related either to the progression of disease
or to the greater number of sclerotherapy treat￾ments in these patients. Our experience suggests
that while gastropathy may develop after sclerother￾apy in some individuals the converse is true in
others. In theory obstruction of blood flow at the
gastro-oesophageal junction may increase conges￾tion by blood vessels flowing from the stomach. This
effect is likely to be very variable as recent studies
using Doppler ultrasound'6 have shown that blood
flow in oesophageal varices may sometimes be
towards the stomach and therefore thrombosis of
these varices would reduce and certainly not induce
congestion in the gastric mucosa. In the majority of
patients, therefore, the relationship between sclero￾therapy and gastropathy is not straightforward and
the presence of the gastric lesion is probably
independent of the patency of oesophageal varices.
THERAPEUTIC IMPLICATIONS
Congestive gastropathy was mild and transient in
more than half of the patients. Complications did
not occur and progression was uncommon during
the short period of follow up. In contrast, patients
with severe or persistent gastropathy are prone to
clinically significant haemorrhage.
Twenty five of our patients with severe changes
received H2 receptor antagonists, five received
sucralfate and all were prescribed antacids at some
stage. None of these agents had any significant
effect upon either the gastritis or the bleeding. This
tends to support the hypothesis that it is congestion
rather than erosion which is the major factor
damaging the gastric mucosa. The rational approach
to treatment is therefore a reduction of the portal
venous pressure which should thus reduce the
congestion in the gastic mucosa.2.
Portosystemic shunting effectively reduces portal
pressure and bleeding from gastritis is rare after this
procedure.2 17-19 An alternative surgical approach is
to reduce the gastric blood flow alone by devascular￾ising the upper two thirds of the stomach and
combining it with an oesophageal transection. We
have used this procedure in eight patients, specific￾ally for controlling severe haemorrhagic gastritis and
it has been successful in five. As with portosystemic
decompression this procedure is not without con￾siderable risk in patients with advanced liver
disease.
Methods aimed at reducing portal blood pressure
or flow by pharmacological means would clearly be
preferable to surgery. Although Lebrec and col￾leagues20 reported that propranolol reduced variceal
haemorrhage, close inspection of their paper reveals
that the drug also reduced the incidence of gastritis.
On an anecdotal basis we have observed significant
improvement in several patients with severe persis￾1231

tent gastritis treated with propranolol and we are
currently evaluating its effectiveness by means of a
controlled trial.
In conclusion, the macroscopic gastritis noted in
patients with portal hypertension differs from that
seen in the absence of liver disease in that (a) the
histological appearance is quite distinct (b) it is
unrelated to the aetiology of the portal hypertension
(c) it does not respond to conventional anti￾inflammatory drug therapy and (d) the histological
changes are found elsewhere in the gastrointestinal
tract. In the light of the clinical, haemodynamic and
histological observations the term 'congestive
gastropathy' appears to be more appropriate.
