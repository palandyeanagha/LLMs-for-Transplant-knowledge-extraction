Background: Posttransplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) has a long-term impact on kidney 
transplantation outcomes, such as graft and patient survival. The incidence and risk 
factors of PTDM are well studied, but long-term follow-up results remain unavailable. We 
examined the long-term incidence and relative risk factors of PTDM. 
Methods: A hospital information system database for kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) 
for a transplantation center between 1983 and 2018 was used to perform this retrospec￾tive cohort study. KTRs with DM diagnosis and continuous use of hypoglycemic agents 
for more than 3 months were defined as having PTDM. Demographics and comorbidities 
before transplantation were also collected. Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to deter￾mine the cumulative incidence and relative risk factors.
Results: A total of 296 PTDM cases were confirmed (28.46%) in this study. An increased 
cumulative incidence associated with age was noted, which was significantly increased 
in those aged ≥40 years. Male sex, hypertension, hyperlipidemia before transplantation, 
cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, and tacrolimus-based regimens were also risk factors. 
No significant correlation was found between the development of PTDM and the in￾crease of human leukocyte antigen mismatches, the primary causes of end-stage renal 
disease, and acute rejection.
Conclusions: PTDM incidence was high in this cohort study. Characteristics such as age 
≥40 years, tacrolimus use, comorbidity of hypertension and hyperlipidemia before trans￾plantation, and CMV infection were associated with a high risk of PTDM. Monitoring 
and adjusting preventable risk factors such as CMV infection might be useful to prevent 
PTDM.

[1,2]. PTDM is not only associated with increased mortal￾ity and morbidity, but also with higher rates of cardiovas￾cular diseases and infection, which severely affect long￾term graft survival and cause patient death [3-5]. Previous 
studies have revealed that the incidence of PTDM varies 
from 9.1% to 45.3% in the first year after transplanta￾tion [1,6]. Clinical risk factors such as obesity, sedentary 
lifestyle, and viral infections (e.g., hepatitis C virus and 
cytomegalovirus [CMV]) have been reported. Immunosup￾pressive agents with diabetogenic effects are also used in 
posttransplant therapy, including corticosteroids, tacro￾limus, cyclosporine, and mammalian target of rapamycin 
[7]. However, the long-term patient and graft incidence in 
Asian patients with PTDM are scant. This study aimed to 
examine the cumulative incidence of and risk factors for 
PTDM in Taiwan’s kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). 
Furthermore, the impact of calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) 
on PTDM was also determined.
METHODS
We conducted this study in compliance with the principles 
of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study’s protocol was re￾viewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of 
Taichung Veterans General Hospital (IRB No. CE18303B). 
Written informed consents were waived owing to the use 
of a decoded database in the Hospital Information System 
(HIS).
Study Design
The HIS database of a central Taiwan transplantation cen￾ter was used for this retrospective cohort study. According 
to World Health Organization/American Diabetes Associ￾ation (WHO/ADA) international consensus guidelines [8,9] 
and a PTDM consensus meeting held in 2013, patients 
with PTDM were defined as “clinically stable patients who 
have developed persistent posttransplant hyperglycemia” 
[10]. We, therefore, determined the candidates of PTDM 
through the following criteria: (1) post-KTRs; (2) confirmed 
diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (International Classification 
of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-
CM 250] or International Classification of Diseases, Ten 
Revision, Clinical Modification, ICD-10-CM, E10-E14); and 
(3) continuous use of antihyperglycemic agents or insulin 
for more than 3 months (to reduce the risk of overestima￾tion of transient hyperglycemia into PTDM). If the KTRs 
received hyperglycemic treatments for less than 3 months 
after DM was confirmed, they were defined as being “tran￾sient hyperglycemic” instead of having PTDM.
Study Population
A HIS database was used. Anonymous adult KTRs who 
underwent transplants between May 1983 and November 
2018 in the study center were eligible. The KTRs, who had 
survived with a functioning allograft for at least 1 year after 
transplantation, were included. Patients with pre-transplant 
diabetes, a follow-up period of less than 1 year after trans￾plantation, and multiple organ transplants were excluded. 
Data collected included patient demographics, body mass 
index (BMI) at the time of transplantation, causes of kid￾ney failure, date of the kidney transplant, kidney source, 
count of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatches, 
biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR), maintenance immu￾nosuppressants including CNIs (tacrolimus and cyclospo￾rin), which were used for more than 3 months, and comor￾bidities before transplantation. The comorbidities before 
the study end date included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, 
anemia, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and CMV infection. The 
end time for PTDM risk analyses was the diagnosis date 
of PTDM or the study’s end date.
Statistical Analysis
Continuous variables were expressed as median (interquar￾tile range [IQR]). The Mann-Whitney U-test and chi-square 
test were used to compare continuous and categorical 
variables in PTDM-negative and PTDM-positive patients. 
Survival curves were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier 
method. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM 
SPSS ver. 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). The P-values 
of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
HIGHLIGHTS
• The cumulative incidence rates of posttransplant diabe￾tes mellitus (PTDM) are increased with age, especially 
more than 40 years.
• Pretransplant hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cyto￾megalovirus infection posttransplant might be risk fac￾tors for PTDM.
• The incidence of PTDM increased with time and was 
significantly higher in the tacrolimus users than in the 
cyclosporine users.

RESULTS
A total of 1,143 adults who underwent kidney transplanta￾tion during the study period were included, and 103 were 
eventually excluded due to inclusion criteria violation. 
Finally, 1,040 eligible KTRs were enrolled, with a medi￾an age at transplantation of 44.3 years (IQR, 34.7–52.7 
years) and median follow-up period of 12.7 years (IQR, 
4.5–20.1 years). A larger portion of this cohort comprised 
men (580 patients, 55.8%). Among them, 296 patients had

PTDM (28.5%). More male patients were found to develop 
PTDM than female patients (61.1% vs. 38.9%, P<0.001). Old￾er patients (PTDM vs. non-PTDM, 48.4 vs. 42.1; P<0.001) 
and higher BMI (PTDM vs. non-PTDM, 24.2 vs. 22.3 kg/m2
; 
P<0.001) were found to have higher probabilities of de￾veloping PTDM. The donor source was mainly cadaveric 
(81.9%), but no apparent relationship was confirmed be￾tween the donor source and PTDM after transplantation 
(P=0.474). No significant correlation was found between 
the development of PTDM and the increase in HLA mis￾matches (P=0.776), the primary cause of end-stage renal 
disease (P=0.144), and the occurrence of BPAR before 
PTDM was diagnosed (P=0.642). However, hypertension 
(P=0.003) and hyperlipidemia (P=0.002) were the most 
frequently seen comorbidities before transplantation in 
the PTDM group compared with the non-PTDM group. 
The study results revealed that 1.4% of KTRs had CMV in￾fection after transplantation. The incidence of CMV infec￾tion in the PTDM group was significantly higher than that 
in the non-PTDM group (3.0% vs. 0.8%, P=0.016). Regard￾ing immunosuppressants, tacrolimus-based regimens 
were significantly more prescribed in the PTDM group 
than in the cyclosporine-based regimens (P=0.009) (Table 
1). 
Age groups were further divided as “20–39,” “40–59,” 
and “≥60” when cumulative incidences were examined. Cu￾mulative incidences of PTDM 1, 5, 10, and 15 years post￾transplant in the three age groups were 2.3%, 12.9%, and 
22.3%; 4.7%, 18.9%, and 29.5%; 8.9%, 25.1%, and 34.2%; 
and 14.0%, 29.3%, and 42.2% (P<0.001), respectively, indi￾cating that the cumulative incidence of PTDM increased 
proportionally with time after transplantation. The post￾hoc test obtained similar results (Fig. 1).
The 1-year cumulative incidence of PTDM was 12.9% 
for tacrolimus users and 5.2% for cyclosporine users. Their 
5-year cumulative incidence was 18.8% and 8.4%, respec￾tively. Their 10-year cumulative incidence was 27.2% and 
10.4%, respectively, and their 15-year cumulative incidence 
was 34.9% and 13.7%, respectively (Fig. 2). The incidence 
of PTDM increased with time and was significantly high￾er in the tacrolimus users than in the cyclosporine users 
(P<0.001).
DISCUSSION
This study was the first to retrospectively examine the 
incidence of PTDM after kidney transplantation using the 
Medical Center’s HIS database, which has the second-larg￾est amount of annual kidney transplantation cases in Tai￾wan. Patients with PTDM were defined as “KTRs having 
confirmed diagnosis of DM and continuous use of antihy￾perglycemic drugs or insulin for more than three months" 
to reduce the potential overestimation of transient hy￾perglycemic cases, including those who had tremendous 
amounts of steroids for acute rejection. The incidence of 
BPAR varied insignificantly between the two study groups 
among all age groups, showing that this study did not 
include patients with transient hyperglycemia into PTDM.

higher than that (17.0%) reported by Yeh et al. [11] using 
the National Health Insurance Database of Taiwan but con￾sistent with that reported (14%–37.0%) in another study 
[12]. The prolonged study period and sample origin might 
be the leading causes of the differences between the pres￾ent findings and the results of Yeh et al. [11]. 
Risks factors for PTDM were identified as: (1) age: 
the possibility of PTDM development increased with an 
increase in the age of patients undergoing kidney trans￾plantation, especially for those aged more than 40 years 
at transplantation; (2) male sex: more male patients devel￾oped PTDM than female patients: (3) obesity and comor￾bidities before transplant: patients with higher BMI, hyper￾tension and hyperlipidemia had a higher risk of PTDM than 
those without; (4) CMV infection after transplantation; 
and (5) use of tacrolimus: patients who had received tac￾rolimus-based immunosuppressive therapy after kidney 
transplant had a higher risk of PTDM than those who had 
received cyclosporine-based therapy (Table 1).
A positive correlation has been demonstrated between 
older age and the development of PTDM [13,14]. Similar 
results were obtained in our study (Table 1, Fig. 1). Wheth￾er sex is a predictor of PTDM development is still contro￾versial [6,15], but more male patients were found to devel￾op PTDM than female patients in the study. Similar results 
were observed in previous studies [6,16,17]. Therefore, we 
conclude that sex might not be an independent predictor 
of PTDM, and large-scale studies are warranted to verify 
this finding. BMI may affect transplant outcomes, which 
has been documented in previous studies [7]. Our results 
also showed that higher BMI have higher PTDM develop￾ment.
No positive correlation was demonstrated between do￾nor source and PTDM incidence in our study, which was in 
accordance with the previous study because of donor vari￾ables, including age, race, and sex. The age of the recipient 
was independently correlated with the incidence of PTDM 
[17]. Diabetes and glucose intolerance are often associat￾ed with metabolic syndrome, especially hypertension and 
hyperlipidemia [10]. Hypertension and hyperlipidemia were 
the most frequently seen underlying diseases before trans￾plantation for patients who developed PTDM compared 
to those who did not. Similar results were found in a pre￾vious study, which reported that recipients with a history 
of hypertension were 1.26 times (95% confidence interval, 
1.11–1.44) more likely to develop PTDM after transplant 
[18]. Additionally, if the recipients had a history of hy￾pertension and the primary cause of the end-stage renal 
disease was hypertension, the recipients were 3.0 times 
(21.3% vs. 7.5%, P=0.029) as likely to develop PTDM after 
transplant compared to the non-hypertensive recipients [6]. 
A previous study [14] showed that patients with high blood 
lipid profiles (total cholesterol and low-density-lipopro￾tein-cholesterol and triglyceride levels) before transplan￾tation who later developed PTDM had a higher incidence, 
which suggested that pretransplant hyperlipidemia is one 
of the predictors of PTDM; this finding is consistent with 
our study results. 
Several immunosuppressive agents commonly used 
after transplants have been shown to possess potential 
diabetogenic effects [19]. The incidence of PTDM was sig￾nificantly higher among patients receiving tacrolimus than 
among those receiving cyclosporine [2,20], which was also 
revealed in our study. However, the correlation between CNI 
and PTDM incidence is quite tricky because there are many 
confounding variables [20]. For instance, without a change 
in tacrolimus’ therapeutic concentration (5–10 ng/mL), 
insulin secretion was enhanced when tacrolimus was ad￾ministered with a 33% dose reduction, suggesting that the 
diabetogenic effect of tacrolimus is dose-dependent [21]. 
The impact of CMV on PTDM development remains 
controversial. However, a review of current findings re￾vealed that the overall adjusted odds ratio for PTDM de￾velopment in CMV-positive KTRs was 1.94, indicating that 
CMV infection is a risk factor for an increasing incidence 
of PTDM [22]. Similar results were demonstrated in the 
present study, and prophylaxis against CMV infection after 
kidney transplantation is strongly suggested. In conclu￾sion, PTDM incidence was as high as 28.46% in this long￾term study. Age of more than 40 years, tacrolimus use, 
pretransplant hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and CMV in￾fection might be risk factors for PTDM. Furthermore, mon￾itoring and adjusting preventable risk factors such as CMV 
infection might be useful to prevent PTDM development.
