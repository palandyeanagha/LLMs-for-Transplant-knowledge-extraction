Abstract
A 26-year-old woman currently treated for systemic lupus erythematosus with steroid therapy presented
with sudden onset of right hemiplegia. Computed tomography of the brain showed a large frontoparietal
ring-enhanced lesion with perifocal edema. Stereotactic aspiration of the lesion revealed Cladosporium
bantianum. The size of the abscess did not reduce in spite of optimum antifungal treatment. The abscess
was subsequently excised through a frontoparietal craniotomy. At follow up after 24 months, there was
no recurrence of the abscess. Cerebral Cladosporium bantianum infection is usually refractory to
antifungal agents and the prognosis is very poor. This patient had the longest survival period in a case
of Cladosporium brain abscess so far reported.

Introduction
Fungal infections of the brain are rare,6) but
intracranial fungal infection is widely found in
patients after treatment with antibiotics or steroids,
in patients with debilitating diseases, and especially
in those conditions which modify the host's immune
responses.9) Cladosporium bantianum is a ubiquitous
soil- or plant-based fungus and has strong affinity
for neural tissue. The imaging features are similar to
any other intracranial fungal infection. The diagno￾sis is based on histological examination and culture.
The surgical management of Cladosporium bantia￾num is formidable and the overall prognosis is poor.
Only 29 cases of cerebral abscess caused by
Cladosporium bantianum4) have been reported. Here
we report another case of cerebral abscess caused by
Cladosporium bantianum infection in an im￾munocompromised patient.
Case Report
A 26-year-old woman presented with sudden onset
of inability to move the right extremities and was
unable to walk. She had been treated under a diagno￾sis of systemic lupus erythematosus with steroid
therapy for the past 2 months. She had no fever or
convulsion. On examination, she was dull and
apathic, and obeyed commands poorly. Fundus
examination was normal. She had right upper
motor neuron facial paresis and right hemiparesis
grade 3. There were no meningeal signs. Systemic
examination revealed no abnormality. Computed
tomography (CT) of the brain with contrast medium
showed a large left frontoparietal intracerebral
ring-enhanced lesion with severe mass effect and
irregular shaggy peripheral enhancement (Fig. 1).
Cerebrospinal fluid examination found no abnor￾mality. India ink preparation was negative for cryp￾tococci. Stereotactic aspiration of the lesion re￾vealed brown pigmented hyphae suggestive of
pheohyphomycosis. Amphotericin B was adminis￾tered intravenously (40 mg) and intrathecally (1 mg)
for 2 weeks but the patient did not show any im￾provement in neurological condition. Follow-up CT
showed the lesion had increased in size with sig￾nificant central necrosis (Fig. 2).
A left frontoparietal craniotomy exposed the le￾sion in the middle frontal gyrus at a depth of 2 cm
from the surface. The lesion was grayish, firm,
gritty, and vascular and had a thick capsule. There

was no pus. Radical excision was performed and the
ventricular body was opened. The thick wall of the
granuloma was firmly attached to the underlying
choroidal vessels. Histological examination of the
lesion showed dense neutrophilic infiltrates with
many multinucleated giant cells resembling granulo￾ma, separated by hyphae with brownish pigments
within and outside giant cells (Fig. 3). The findings
were consistent with the diagnosis of pheohyphomy￾cosis. Gomori's methenamine-silver staining con￾firmed the presence of fungal hyphae. Culture of the
necrotic debris revealed Cladosporium bantianum.
Postoperatively the patient had marked improve￾ment in mentation. However, her right hemiparesis
showed no appreciable improvement. At follow up
after 24 months, she was alert and coherent, but the
neurological deficit remained unchanged.
Discussion
Cladosporium bantianum, also known as Xylohypha
bantiana, is a ubiquitous soil- or plant-based fungus
and distributed worldwide. The route of entry of this
fungus is unknown. The most widely accepted por￾tal of entry is through inhalation of spores followed
by involvement of brain via the hematogenous
route.1,5) The fungus is abundantly found in the skin,
lung, gastrointestinal tract, and ear. Involvement of
the paranasal sinuses, and ear and pulmonary infec￾tion have been reported.2,12) Occasionally the fungus
may spread by traumatic implantation.7) The fun￾gus has strong affinity for glial tissue in humans as
well as experimental animals.10) Parenchymal ab￾scess is a more common variety of central ner￾vous system involvement. Meningeal involvement
has also been reported.8)
CT shows cerebral fungal infection as a

hypodense lesion with peripheral ring enhancement
on contrast administration. The ring enhancement
may be variable. The lesion may be solitary or multi￾ple, and multiple conglomerate lesions may resem￾ble a tuberculoma.7) The CT features of intracerebral
mycosis are dependent upon the type of fungus and
the dominant infective form, i.e., yeast or hyphae.11)
The hyphal form causes vascular occlusion and sec￾ondary abscess formation whereas the yeast form
causes non-caseating granulomas, which appear as
nodular enhanced lesions. The lesion may be associ￾ated with significant mass effect. In our case, CT
showed a large single abscess with poor peripheral
enhancement.
Cladosporium abscesses appear as hypointense on
T1-weighted and T2-weighted magnetic resonance
imaging. The central portion of the lesion may ap￾pear as inhomogeneously hyperintense secondary to
liquefactive necrosis, macromolecules, and high
protein component.4) These changes are pronounced
in an abscess with a large cavity. The surrounding
capsule is isointense on T1-weighted and hypoin￾tense on T2-weighted images, possibly due to the
presence of hemoglobin breakdown products and
free radicals produced by active phagocytosis by
macrophages. The edema secondary to the abscess
appears as uniformly hyperintense areas on T2-
weighted images. However, the perilesional area
appears as isointense which is suggestive of cerebri￾tis and active infection.
Direct microscopic examination of the pus in 10%
potassium hydroxide revealed pale brown septate
fungal hyphae with intercalated swollen cells at ir￾regular intervals and branching of conidial chains.4)
Similar morphology was seen using periodic acid￾Schiff and Gram staining specific for fungi. Culture
of the pus on Sabouraud dextrose agar and chloram￾phenicol with and without cycloheximide at 229C
and at 429C yielded black colonies.4) Histological
examination of the abscess showed chronic inflam￾matory granulation tissue with large numbers of
foreign body giant cells containing fungal hyphae.
The hyphae measured approximately 2–6 nm and
were of variable length.
The optimum treatment of fungal infection due to
Cladosporium bantianum remains unclear.10) Surgi￾cal excision followed by appropriate antifungal
drugs has not yielded encouraging results as 15 of
the 20 patients died despite aggressive surgical treat￾ment and intensive chemotherapy.6) All patients
showed recurrence and died 3–11 months following
surgery.3,6) Our patient has achieved the longest
survival until now. The marked improvement in the
mentation may be due to the reduction in intracrani￾al pressure. The motor deficit has not shown any
appreciable improvement even after completion of
antifungal therapy, probably due to vascular occlu￾sion and ischemic changes. The therapeutic concen￾tration of antifungal agents cannot be achieved in
the cerebrospinal fluid, so their role remains doubt￾ful in the treatment of cerebral fungal infections.3)
Fluorocytosine was effective in only one reported
case so far whereas the majority of cases had a
dismal response.6)
