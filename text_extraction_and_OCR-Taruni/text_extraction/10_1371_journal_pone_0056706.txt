Abstract
Central nervous system (CNS) invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a fatal complication in immunocompromised patients. Confirming
the diagnosis is rarely accomplished as invasive procedures are impaired by neutropenia and low platelet count.
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures or galactomannan (GM) regularly yield negative results thus suggesting the need for
improving diagnostic procedures. Therefore the performance of an established Aspergillus-specific nested polymerase chain
reaction assay (PCR) in CSF samples of immunocompromised patients with suspicion of CNS IA was evaluated. We identified
113 CSF samples from 55 immunocompromised patients for whom CNS aspergillosis was suspected. Of these patients 8/55
were identified as having proven/probable CNS IA while the remaining 47 patients were classified as having either possible
(n = 22) or no CNS IA (n = 25). PCR positivity in CSF was observed for 8/8 proven/probable, in 4/22 possible CNS IA patients
and in 2/25 NoIA patients yielding sensitivity and specificity values of 1.0 (95% CI 0.68–1) and 0.93 (95% CI 0.77–0.98) and a
positive likelihood ratio of 14 and negative likelihood ratio of 0.0, respectively, thus resulting in a diagnostic odds ratio of ‘.
The retrospective analysis of CSF samples from patients with suspected CNS IA yielded a high sensitivity of the nested PCR
assay. PCR testing of CSF samples is recommended for patients for whom CNS IA is suspected, especially for those whose
clinical condition does not allow invasive procedures as a positive PCR result makes the presence of CNS IA in that patient
population highly likely.

Introduction
Cerebral aspergillosis is a frequent and often lethal complication
of disseminated invasive Aspergillosis (IA). [1] Mortality rates were
found to be as high as 88% in a meta-analysis which reported on
1941 patients and encompassed a timeframe from 1995 to 1999.
[2] Despite improved radiological techniques, the introduction of
voriconazole and the addition of neurosurgical treatment proce￾dures which have significantly improved the outcome [3], the
response rate in severely immunocompromised patients is still poor
with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients
showing responses in less than 15%. [4].
Diagnostic procedures are still insufficient. Improvements have
been made by introducing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) into
the armamentarium, [5] however radiomorphological signs are
suggestive, but not specific. Thus stereotactical biopsies with
histology and microbiological culture procedures still remain the
gold standard in obtaining definite proof of cerebral IA. However,
especially in the hematological patient population underlying low
platelet count or neutropenia precludes these procedures or
significantly increases risk of complications. Therefore there is an
urgent need for improving the diagnostic certainty by obtaining
microbiologic evidence of cerebral IA with less invasive proce￾dures.
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which can usually be obtained with
low risk in patients with low platelet count, would be the obvious
choice. However CSF cultures are usually negative [6] and cell
count, glucose or protein concentration are not specific. Never￾theless it is usually performed to rule out other infectious causes in
routine clinical practice. The clinical evidence of surrogate
parameters like galactomannan (GM) in CSF for diagnosis of
cerebral IA is scarce and provided as case-series with small

numbers of patients. [7], [8], [9] Despite this small numbers
(n = 5), CSF GM is included as microbiological evidence in the
European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer
Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group
(EORTC/MSG) [10] invasive fungal infections (IFI) consensus
criteria and mentioned in the recent European Conference on
Infections in Leukemia (ECIL-3) recommendations. [11].
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays have shown to be
another promising diagnostic approach, however, up to now
they are not part of the EORTC/MSG IFI consensus criteria,
as there is a variety of methods and lack of standardization.
Although several groups have reported on the performance of
PCR for diagnosing IA in blood [12] or BAL, [13,14] its use in
CSF for diagnosing cerebral IA has rarely been reported. Our
group published on the successful use of a nested Aspergillus￾specific PCR assay in CSF samples of four proven/probable
cerebral aspergillosis patients [15], underlining the potential of
this molecular diagnostic tool in this clinical setting. Recently,
another group observed positive Aspergillus-specific PCR signals
in CSF using real-time PCR in 6/38 patients with heteroge￾neous underlying conditions. In that study, two consecutive
PCR results defined the diagnosis, however CSF cultures for
Aspergillus were negative and biopsy results were not reported
[16]. Kami et al. observed a better sensitivity of CSF PCR
compared to CSF GM in 5 probable CNS IA patients; [17] all
other remaining publications are single case reports. Addition￾ally, in an animal model of experimentally-induced cerebral
aspergillosis a high sensitivity of CSF PCR for diagnosing
cerebral IA was observed. [18].
In order to further elucidate the performance of an Aspergillus
specific PCR assay in CSF for diagnosing cerebral IA we
performed this multicenter trial.
Patients and Methods
Patients
CSF samples submitted to the scientific laboratory of the 3rd
Medical Department of the Mannheim University Hospital for
diagnosing cerebral IA between February of 1999 and May 2011
were analyzed to elucidate PCR performance in CSF.
Immunocompromised patients at high risk for fungal infections
were included in this retrospective analysis. Written informed
consent of patients or legal representatives had been acquired
prior to CSF sampling and analysis was done according to Good
Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines as well as in concordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the local
Ethics Committee (Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine,
University of Heidelberg, Germany; Reference Number 2007-
240N-MA). The trial was registered by ClinicalTrials.gov (Iden￾tifier: NCT01617759).
Patient Characteristics
One hundred thirteen CSF samples from 55 immunocompro￾mised pediatric and adult patients at high risk for IA were
obtained between February of 1999 and May of 2011 and
analysed by an Aspergillus-specific nested PCR assay described
previously [19]; for patients characteristics see Table 1 and 2.
CSF samples were referred from the University Hospitals of
Mannheim, Jena, Freiburg, Ulm, Bochum, and Du¨ sseldorf; Bone
Marrow Transplantation Center Wiesbaden; General Hospitals of
Frankfurt/Oder, Erfurt and Schwedt; all in Germany.
Classification of Cerebral Aspergillosis
The patients were classified according to the proposed case
definitions for CNS IA by Schwartz et al.: [3] In proven CNS
aspergillosis there was cultural or histologic evidence for Aspergillus
in cerebrospinal fluid or brain biopsy specimens. Patients classified
to have proven CNS aspergillosis without positive fungal cultures
from the CNS required a positive histologic or cytologic specimen
from brain/CNS and a positive culture with growth of Aspergillus
from other sterile body sites or bronchoalveolar lavage. Patients
defined as having probable CNS IA had radiologic signs of CNS
infection in cranial computed tomographic (cCT) or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) scans plus a proven Aspergillus infection
at body sites outside the CNS. Proven aspergillosis outside the
CNS was classified according to the latest EORTC/MSG criteria.
[10] Furthermore, highly immunocompromised patients (either
allogeneic stem cell transplantation or with neutropenic hemato￾logical disease) with imaging suggesting invasive aspergillosis plus
signs and symptoms of a CNS infection were also classified as
probable CNS aspergillosis if they had a positive Aspergillus
culture from a nonsterile site or an adequate antigen result from
cerebrospinal fluid. Patients defined to have possible CNS IA had
compatible imaging and host factors but no microbiologic
criterion for probable CNS IA, while the NoIA group consisted
of patients for whom CNS IA was highly unlikely based on the lack
of intensive immunosuppression (insufficient host factor criteria) or
without compatible radiological findings.
Radiological Diagnostics
All patients received either cMRI or cCT prior to CSF sampling
performed according to standardized techniques. Radiological
diagnostic scan results were analysed by experienced radiologists at
the time of imaging in a non-blinded fashion. Typical lesions for
CNS IA in MRI consisted of abscesses, mass lesions or infarction￾like lesions, unlikely for other infectious causes or bleeding.
CSF Sampling
CSF sampling was performed as clinically indicated; reasons for
CSF sampling were suspected CNS infection or suspicion of
meningeal involvement or CNS manifestation of the underlying
disease. CSF sampling was not performed solely for study reasons.
Vials of 1 to 2 ml of CSF were shipped immediately with delivery
time of less than 24 hours and the specimens were sent at ambient
temperature. The diagnostic work-up was usually performed
according to the guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Working
Party (AGIHO) of the German Society of Hematology and
Oncology (DGHO). [20], [21] Typical CSF volumes were
between 1–2 mL. Median cell count in the proven/probable
CNS IA patients was 3/ml (range 1–266/ml), 4/m (range 0–777/ml)
for the possible patients and 1/ml for the NoIA patients (range 0–
524).
DNA Preparation and PCR Analysis
Total DNA was extracted from 1.0 mL of CSF samples and
processed by an experienced technical assistant uninformed of
clinical data according to the DNA extraction and nested PCR
protocol published by Skladny et al. [19] and modified for CSF by
Hummel et al. [15].
Briefly, in contrast to DNA extraction from other clinical
samples, DNA from CSF was extracted from the whole sample
(1.0 to 2 ml) instead of from the cell pellet. Purification of DNA
was performed by phenol-chloroform extraction. 100 ng of total
DNA was used as the template per 25-ml PCR mixture. In the
nested two-step PCR technique, two pairs of oligonucleotide

primers (AFU 7S and AFU 7AS for the first step and AFU 5S and
AFU 5AS for the second step), derived from sequences of the A.
fumigatus 18S rRNA gene (GenBank accession no. AB008401) and
specific for Aspergillus species, were used (Skladny et al. [19]). A
138-bp PCR fragment encoded by the human glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase gene (GenBank accession no. X55448)
was amplified by primers G6PD1S and 1AS in each clinical
sample as an internal control. All PCR reactions were performed
as duplicates. The sensitivity of this nested PCR assay is 1 to 5
CFU per ml of CSF.
PCR amplification was done as follows: The standard PCR
mixture contained 0.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase, 6.25 nmol of
the deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 10 pmol of primer (first step,
primer AFU7S-AFU7AS; second step, primer AFU5S-AFU5AS).
PCR was performed using the following conditions: For the first
PCR, 2 min at 94uC and then 23 cycles of 40 s at 94uC, 1 min at
65uC, and 1 min at 72uC with a terminal step of 5 min at 72uC
and then the mixture was held at 4uC; for the second PCR, 2 min
at 94uC and then 35 cycles of 40 s at 94uC, 1 min at 65uC, and
1 min at 72uC, with a terminal step of 5 min at 72uC, and then the
mixture was held at 4uC. For the second PCR, approximately 1 to
2 ml of the first-round PCR product was used. The PCR products
were separated by 2.5% agarose gel electrophoresis, stained with
ethidium bromide, and visualized with UV light. Control samples
included all the constituents in the reaction mixture except
genomic DNA. Diluted samples of A. fumigatus were used as
positive controls, whereas DNA from the human cell line T47D
was used as a negative control. The PCR assay used in this study
has been shown to detect a minimum of seven Aspergillus species: A.
fumigatus, A. flavus, A. niger, A. terreus, A. clavatus, A. versicolor and A.
nidulans), whereas the PCR assay does not detect other fungal,
bacterial or human DNA. The amplicon has been sequenced in
the methodological establishment of this assay and has been shown
to match the corresponding GenBank sequence. [19].
Statistical Analysis
Sensitivity rates, specificity rates, positive and negative likeli￾hood ratios, diagnostic odds ratio as well were performed using
GraphPad Prism for Windows 5.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla,
CA, USA) and Microsoft Excel 2010 (Microsoft Software,
Redmond, USA). Statistical analysis for comparing PCR positivity
was performed using Wilcoxon signed rank test, comparison of
CSF cell count was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis-test and
Mann-Whitney-U-test. P values of less than.05 were considered
statistically significant differences.
Results
According to the aforementioned criteria, five patients were
classified as proven, three patients as having probable cerebral
aspergillosis, as well as 22 patients having possible CNS IA, the
remaining 25 patients did not fulfil the EORTC/MSG criteria for
invasive fungal disease (modified by Schwartz et al [3] for CNS
IA).
For determination of PCR performance all proven/probable
patients (n = 8) were evaluated while the remaining noIA patients
(n = 25) were used as the control population, the possible patients
(n = 22) were excluded from the analysis of PCR performance.
Positive PCR signals were detected in 22 samples from 14
patients. Of these, 5 patients were classified as proven, 3 as
probable and 4 as possible CNS IA; two patients having no CNS
IA were found to be PCR positive.
PCR positivity was significantly higher in patients classified as
having proven/probable CNS aspergillosis compared to NoIA
patients (p,0.006).

Aspergillus PCR in Cerebrospinal Fluid
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e56706

There was no statistical difference in CSF cell count between
proven/probable CNS IA patients, possible CNS IA patients and
no NoIA patients. When comparing the CSF cell count in the
PCR-positive patients (n = 14) compared to the PCR negative
patients (n = 41) no statistical difference was observed.
Diagnostic Performance of CSF PCR in Proven/Probable
(n = 8) vs. NoIA Cases (n = 25)
For patients with proven cerebral aspergillosis (n = 5) as well as
for the 3 patients with probable cerebral aspergillosis, PCR was
found to be positive in all cases (8/8). In the other patients positive
PCR signals were observed in 6/47 cases. Of these, four were
classified as having possible cerebral IA while the remaining two
were classified as having NoIA. Of these 6 cases 4 had imaging
results compatible with CNS IA, two had negative imaging results.
In these 6 patients no biopsies or autopsies were performed, CSF
culture was negative and in two of these patients GM CSF was
negative.
Observed test performance parameters for PCR (comparing
proven/probable cases vs. NoIA patients) yielded sensitivity and
specificity values of 1.0 (95% CI, 0.68–1.0) and 0.93 (95% CI,
0.77–0.98) respectively, with a positive likelihood ratio (PLR) of
14, a negative likelihood ratio (NLR) of 0 and a diagnostic odds
ratio of .200 (‘). (Table 3).
Discussion
We systematically investigated the performance of an Aspergillus
specific PCR assay in CSF samples of immunocompromised
patients for evaluating its ability to diagnose CNS IA. All patients
who suffered from CNS aspergillosis as defined by the strict
criteria by Schwartz et al. 3 showed a positive PCR signal in CSF.
Although this conclusion is based on a limited number of patients
for whom CNS aspergillosis is definitely present, we found its
performance promising. Despite these seemingly small numbers,
our study reports the largest number of proven/probable CNS IA
cases up to now in terms of evaluating diagnostic tests or surrogate
parameter performance in CSF samples for CNS aspergillosis.
One of the major hurdles when investigating CNS aspergillosis
is that a definite proof can usually only be obtained via
neurosurgical procedures, despite the fact that it represents the
third most frequent manifestation of disseminated IA [1] and its
incidence has been reported to be as high as 21% in patients with
IA in an autopsy-based study [22]. Therefore, obtaining an ample
number of cases for evaluating a diagnostic tool in that patient
population seems rather difficult and explains the lack of larger
studies on that particular topic. Although it might be suspected in
immunocompromised febrile patients with focal lesions in cMRI
or cCT refractory to broad-spectrum antibiotics, particularly in
HSCT recipients, radiomorphologic results of IA can resemble
infections caused by other organisms such as Cryptococcus neoformans,
Candida spp., Nocardia spp., toxoplasmosis or tuberculosis. [23]
Furthermore, hematologic patients or HSCT recipients often
present with clinical conditions/comorbidities which do not allow
invasive neurosurgical procedures, therefore antifungal therapy is
usually applied in a preemptive approach.
CSF testing has advantages, as it can be safely performed in
patients with low platelet count [24]. It would therefore be
applicable in the majority of hematologic patients, even in those
not deemed eligible for invasive procedures. It has its traditional
place value in CNS infections as other infections (nocardiosis,
cryptococcosis) may be ruled out. For diagnosing CNS IA CSF
GM has been included in the EORTC/MSG Consensus criteria
and is therefore recommended for patients with suspected CNS
IA. The scientific background for this recommendation however is
rather scarce: Viscoli et al. reported in 2002 on five patients with
suspected CNS IA; they found GM significantly elevated in CSF of
these 5 patients compared to 16 control CSF samples. Of these
patients only 3 were autopsy-proven, the other 2 had a nasal swab
positive for Aspergillus culture and no biopsies of the lesions were
performed. [8] In another report, 26 CSF samples from one
patient with proven Aspergillus meningitis were evaluated for GM,
the authors found it to be significantly elevated and its CSF level
decreased with clinical and radiological improvement. [7]
Additionally performed Aspergillus-specific PCR was found to yield
positive signals in several CSF samples. Recently, CSF was
analyzed for non-cryptococcal fungal meningitis in a study which
included immunocompromised and trauma patients [16] using
real-time PCR with primers, specific for both Aspergillus species and
Candida. Altogether 6 positive Aspergillus PCR results were
observed. CSF cultures were negative however, biopsies or CSF
GM were not reported, so that, according to the EORTC Criteria
modified by Schwartz, the definition for proven/probable CNS IA
was not met, as a positive PCR signal is not accepted as
microbiologic evidence.
Our study, despite being based on only 8 patients with proven/
probable CNS aspergillosis shows very good performance of
Aspergillus PCR for diagnosing CNS IA in CSF, with at least one
sample from each patient showing a positive result. This is in line
with the observation made by Kami et al, who reported about
PCR positivity in 5 patients with probable CNS IA case definition
[3] They additionally compared its performance with CSF GM
and found that GM performed slightly worse with positive results
in 4/5 samples. Contrary to the control samples in that
publication, we found positive PCR signals in the other patients
(6/47; 4 possible IA samples, two No CNS IA samples) which may
be attributed to the high sensitivity of our nested PCR approach.
However, none of these six patients had either autopsy or biopsy
performed, all had negative CSF culture results and in addition
two out of six pts had a negative CSF GM, therefore ‘‘upgrading’’
these patients to probable IA was not possible. This represents a
rather common problem when evaluating diagnostic tests in IA; it
is not clear if patients with only possible IA might nevertheless still
be suffering from the infection, but lack microbiological evidence,
as the standard methods defining positivity (e.g. culture) lack
sensitivity. Thus, comparing our proven/probable study popula￾tion solely to the cases classified as having NoIA specificity shows
very good results.

We recognize that our results about Aspergillus-specific PCR
performance are based on a small cohort of patients, albeit our
data represents the biggest series of CSF analysis of surrogate
parameter performance for CNS aspergillosis to date.
In conclusion, PCR testing of CSF is promising for patients in
whom CNS aspergillosis is suspected, especially for those whose
clinical condition does not allow invasive diagnostic procedures. A
positive PCR result makes the presence of CNS IA highly likely
and should prompt adequate therapeutic measures. Additional
prospective clinical trials encompassing an even larger number of
patients with proven and probable CNS IA should validate this
finding.
