Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common 
primary malignancy of the liver. It is the fifth most 
common cancer and second leading cause of cancer￾related death globally (1,2). Although HCC is predominant 
in Southeast Asia and Africa, the incidence rate of HCC 
has been increasing in other regions, particularly in Europe 
and the United States (2,3), which has led to a greater 
interest in the diagnosis and treatment of HCC worldwide.
In the past two decades, clinical guidelines for HCC 
were established and revised by many countries including 
Japan (4), China (5), Hong Kong (6), the Asian-Pacific 
countries (7), European countries (8), and the United 
States (9). The guidelines reflect the differences between 
countries, including the prevalence and etiology of 
HCC, local clinical practice, and medical and insurance 
systems, which entail many differences, especially in 
treatment algorithms. Recently, advancement of HCC 
treatment especially in systemic chemotherapy has been 
attracting attention to the revision of the guidelines for 
HCC.
In this review, we have summarized and compared 
the treatment algorithms in the updated HCC guidelines 
established by Japan, China, Hong Kong, the Asian￾Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL), 
the European Association for the Study of the Liver and 
European Organization for Research and Treatment of 
Cancer (EASL-EORTC), and the American Association 
for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD).
Overview of the treatment algorithms of the 
guidelines
The treatment algorithms in each guideline are 
summarized in Figures 1-6. The characteristics of the 
treatment algorithms in each country are as follows.
Japan
The Japanese evidence-based clinical practice guidelines 
were published in 2005 by the Japan Society of 
Hepatology (JSH). The guidelines were formulated 
based on a systematic review of the evidence for 
hepatocellular carcinoma. The treatment algorithm 
was simple and clear, and the guidelines were revised 
three times, in 2009, 2013 and 2017, incorporating 
growing new evidence and paying more attention to the 
consensus among the specialists in Japan.
In the early version of the Japanese treatment 
algorithm, vascular invasion and extrahepatic metastasis 
were not included because of the lack evidence for 
treatment. However, to reflect the varieties of clinical 
practice in the real world, especially regarding non￾surgical treatments, a treatment algorithm covering 
all situations of HCC was requested especially from 
gastroenterologists. As a result, the latest version of the 
treatment algorithm in the Clinical Practice Guidelines 
for Hepatocellular Carcinoma 2017 included vascular 
invasion and extrahepatic metastasis (Figure 1).

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer￾related death globally. Clinical guidelines for HCC have been established and revised by many countries and regions. 
We summarized and compared the treatment algorithms in the updated HCC guidelines established by Japan, China, 
Hong Kong, the Asian-Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver, the American Association for the Study of 
Liver Diseases, and the European Association for the Study of the Liver and European Organization for Research 
and Treatment of Cancer. Variations in treatment algorithms between the guidelines is inevitable, considering the 
differences in the prevalence and etiology of HCC, local clinical practice, and medical and insurance systems between 
countries or regions, and this might be confusing for practitioners worldwide. A comprehensive understanding of the 
guidelines that are globally available might be useful for future improvement of each guideline.

in the 2017 guideline, performance status was not 
included in the algorithm. Child-Pugh C patients are 
allocated into liver transplantation or palliative care 
according to the Milan criteria. The evaluation of 
liver function was mainly performed by Child Pugh 
classification, while liver damage classification was 
used in the earlier versions. Liver transplantation is 
not indicated for patients with good liver function 
(Child-Pugh A/B) because of the organ shortage for 
transplantation and medical insurance system in Japan. 
In the minor revision of the 2017 Japanese guidelines in 
2019, new expanded criteria for LDLT candidates with 
HCC, the 5-5-500 rule (nodule size ≤ 5 cm in diameter, 
nodule number ≤ 5, and alfa-fetoprotein value ≤ 500 
ng/ml), were established based on a retrospective data 
analysis of the Japanese nationwide survey (10). In the 
presence of extrahepatic metastasis, systemic therapy 
is indicated only for Child-Pugh A patients. After 
evaluation of liver function and extrahepatic metastasis, 
each local and systemic therapy is indicated according 
to vascular invasion, tumor number (≤ 3 or > 3), and 
tumor size (≤ 3 cm or > 3 cm).
China
The Chinese guideline on the management of 
hepatocellular carcinoma was revised in 2017 from the 
previous 2011 version (Figure 2). Based on updated 
evidence and clinical practice, new staging systems 
and treatment algorithms have been developed that 
are far more comprehensive and suitable for use in 
China, focusing on treatment distribution according to 
respective stage.
First of all, the general condition and liver 
function of patients are evaluated by performance 
status and Child-Pugh classification, and patients 
with performance status 3–4 and/or Child-Pugh C 
are distributed into palliative care. Patients with 
performance status 0–2 and Child-Pugh A/B with 
extrahepatic metastasis are assigned into systemic 
therapy, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization 
(TACE), and radiotherapy. After the evaluation of 
performance status, liver function and extrahepatic 
spread, each local and systemic therapy is indicated 
according to vascular invasion, tumor number (solitary, 
2-3 or ≥ 3), and tumor size (≤ 5 cm or > 5 cm for a 
solitary tumor and ≤ 3 cm or > 3 cm for 2-3 tumors).
In particular, surgical resection is widely indicated 
regardless of vascular invasion, tumor number, or tumor 
size in the Chinese guidelines. Liver transplantation 
is indicated in patients with performance status 0–2 
and Child-Pugh A/B, and the indication is determined 
in accordance with the University of California San 
Francisco (UCSF) criteria.
Hong Kong
The Hong Kong liver cancer staging system with 
treatment stratification was published in 2014, in order 
to establish an appropriate prognostic staging system 
for HCC with treatment guidelines applicable to Asian 
patients. The Hong Kong guidelines were formulated 
based on data collected from 3,856 patients with HCC 
predominantly related to hepatitis B treated at Queen 
Mary Hospital in Hong Kong (Figure 3).
In the Hong Kong guidelines, HCC is classified into 
three phases as follows: (1) Early tumor: ≤ 5 cm, ≤ 3 
tumor nodules and no intrahepatic venous invasion; (2) 
Intermediate tumor: i) ≤ 5 cm, either > 3 tumor nodules 
or with intrahepatic venous invasion, or ii) > 5 cm, ≤

In accordance with the tumor classification system, 
performance status, Child-Pugh classification, and the 
presence of extrahepatic metastasis, patients are divided 
into prognostic stages and treatment is allocated.

status 2–4 and/or Child-Pugh C are allocated into 
palliative care, but liver transplantation is indicated 
for early tumor without extrahepatic metastasis. In 
the presence of extrahepatic metastasis, patients with 
performance status 0–1 and Child-Pugh A/B are 
allocated into systemic therapy or palliative care. Each 
local therapy is indicated for patients with performance 
status 0–1 and Child-Pugh A/B without extra hepatic 
metastasis according to tumor phase as follows: 
Early tumor: resection, liver transplantation, ablation; 
Intermediate tumor: resection, TACE; Locally advanced 
tumor: TACE.
APASL
The APASL HCC guidelines were published in 2010 
(11). The guidelines were revised in accordance with the 
statement of the "Toward Revision of the APASL HCC 
Guidelines" meeting held at the 25th annual conference 
of the APASL in Tokyo on February 23, 2016 (Figure 
4). The guidelines are evidence-based and considered 
generally acceptable in the Asia-Pacific region, which 
has a diversity of medical environments. The evidence 
and recommendations in the guideline have been 
graded according to the Grading of Recommendations 
Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) 
system (12).
Consistent with the Japanese evidence-based clinical 
practice guidelines, performance status is not included 
in the algorithm. In the presence of extrahepatic 
metastasis, the first-line therapy is systemic therapy 
for Child-Pugh A/B patients and palliative care for 
Child-Pugh C patients. In the absence of extrahepatic 
metastasis, liver transplantation or palliative care is 
indicated for Child-Pugh C patients according to the 
Milan or UCSF criteria, and each local and systemic 
therapy is indicated according to resectability, vascular 
invasion, tumor number (≤ 3 or > 3), and tumor size (≤ 
3 cm or > 3 cm).
Notably, resectability is included in the APASL 
treatment algorithm, which reflects a variety of surgeons' 
skills and hospital facilities in Asian-Pacific countries 
(13). In addition, resectability is also evaluated from the 
viewpoint of extended indication of liver resection in the 
real world due to recent advances in surgical technique 
and postoperative management (14).
EASL-EORTC
The first European joint guidelines for the management 
of hepatocellular carcinoma were first developed in 
2001 by EASL, updated by EASL-EORTC 2012, 
and then revised in 2018 (Figure 5). The treatment 
algorithms are mostly based on the Barcelona-Clinic 
Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system, which classifies 
HCC patients into five stages, including very early

Shiha et al. (7). 1

stage (Stage 0), early stage (Stage A), intermediate 
stage (Stage B), advanced stage (Stage C), and terminal 
stage (Stage D) (15).
However, the evaluation of liver function has been 
slightly changed in EASL-EORTC guidelines. Although 
the BCLC staging system used Child-Pugh A for Stage 
0 and Child-Pugh A/B for Stages A–C, the EASL￾EORTC guidelines defined "preserved liver function" 
as Child-Pugh A without any ascites, and used this 
criterion to sort treatable stage (Stage 0–C) and terminal 
stage (Stage D). Therefore, according to EASL-EORTC 
guidelines, staging based on liver function is stricter 
than in the BCLC staging system.
The staging of HCC in the EASL-EORTC 
guidelines is as follows: (1) Very early stage (Stage 0: < 
2 cm, single nodule, preserved liver function, and PS 0); 
(2) Early stage (Stage A: single nodule or ≤ 3 nodules 
of < 3 cm, preserved liver function, and PS 0); (3) 
Intermediate stage (Stage B: multinodular, preserved 
liver function, and PS 0); (4) Advanced stage (Stage 
C: portal invasion, extrahepatic spread, preserved liver 
function, and PS 1-2); and (5) Terminal stage (Stage D: 
Child-Pugh C, and PS 3-4).
All stages except Stage A directly connect to 
treatment: Stage 0 to ablation or resection, Stage B to 
chemoembolization, Stage C to systemic therapy, and 
Stage D to palliative care. In Stage A, the patients are 
classified into optimal surgical candidates and transplant 
candidates. Optimal surgical candidacy is based on a 
multiparametric evaluation including compensated Child￾Pugh class A liver function with MELD score < 10, to be 
matched with grade of portal hypertension, acceptable 
amount of remaining parenchyma and possibility of 
adopting a laparoscopic or minimally invasive approach, 
and transplant candidacy as indicated by the Milan 
criteria (16). Ablation is also indicated for patients in 
Stage A who are neither optimal surgical candidates nor 
transplant candidates. Although macrovascular invasion 
is contraindicated for surgery in the EASL-EORTC 
guidelines, intervention to distal portal invasion, at 
segmental or subsegmental level, is considered to 
deserve investigations within a prospectively designed 
protocol reflecting on a Japanese report (17).
AASLD
The AASLD practice guidelines on the management of 
HCC were established in 2005 and revised in 2010 and 
2018 (Figure 6). In accordance with the EASL-EORTC 
guidelines, treatment algorithms are based on the BCLC 
staging system (15) with minor modifications. The 
performance status for BCLC Stages 0, A, and B has 
been changed from 0 to 0-1 and BCLC stage C from 1-2 
to 0-2 in order to better reflect clinical practice in reality 
(18). Therefore, the treatment indication for AASLD 
guidelines is expanded in terms of performance status 
compared to BCLC guidelines.
Treatment is allocated to each stage as follows: (1) 
Stage 0: resection and ablation; (2) Stage A: resection, 
liver transplantation and ablation, transarterial radio 
embolization (TARE), TACE, radiotherapy; (3) Stage 
B: TACE, TARE, and liver transplantation; (4) Stage 
C: systemic therapy, and TARE; and (5) Stage D: liver 
transplantation and palliative care. Unlike EASL￾www.globalhealthmedicine.com

EORTC guidelines, TARE is indicated for Stages A–C, 
and liver transplantation is also considered for Stages B 
and D according to the Milan criteria (16).
Differences of treatment indications between 
guidelines
The differences in treatment indications of resection, 
ablation, TACE, and systemic therapy by tumor 
condition between guidelines are summarized in 
Figure 7. Treatment allocation by liver function and 
performance status is not included, in order to focus on 
the differences of treatment indications based on tumor 
condition. The stratification is mainly conducted by 
treatment in Figure 7a and by country in Figure 7b.
Liver resection
Liver resection is indicated for advanced HCC in 
terms of tumor burden in the treatment algorithms of 
Asian countries (19). The Japanese treatment algorithm 
indicates liver resection for any nodule size (within 3 in 
number). In the Chinese treatment algorithm, surgical 
resection could be a choice for HCC for any nodule 
size and number. The Hong Kong treatment algorithm 
recommends liver resection for any nodule size (within 
3 in number and > 3 nodules within ≤ 5 cm in size). 
Notably, vascular invasion is not a contraindication for 
surgical resection in the Japanese, Chinese, and Hong 
Kong guidelines. In contrast, the EASL-EORTC and 
AASLD guidelines, which follow the BCLC staging 
classification (15), have set narrower indications for 
liver resection. Liver resection is only recommended 
for those with single nodules of any size in the EASL￾EORTC guidelines, and single nodules of any size 
and 2-3 nodules within 3 cm in size in the AASLD 
guidelines. In addition, liver resection is not indicated 
for HCC with vascular invasion in the EASL-EORTC 
and AASLD guidelines.
In terms of liver functional reserve, liver resection is 
an option for patients with Child-Pugh A/B in the Asian 
guidelines, including Japan, China, Hong Kong, and 
the APASL. In accordance with the Asian guidelines, 
patients in Child-Pugh A/B are candidates for surgical 
resection as per the AASLD guidelines, although a 
stricter indication (Child-Pugh A without ascites) is set 
in the EASL-EORTC guidelines. Furthermore, while 
normal bilirubin and portal pressure are supposed to 
serve as a prerequisite for resection under the BCLC 
recommendations, slightly elevated bilirubin or portal 
hypertension is not a definite contraindication for 
surgical resection in Asian guidelines (20). As for

(288)
portal hypertension, the EASL-EORTC indicates that 
portal hypertension should always be balanced with 
the extent of hepatectomy and liver function indicators, 
such as the MELD score and availability and predicted 
effectiveness of alternative HCC therapies in decision 
making for eligibility for liver resection because limited 
hepatectomy in patients with preserved liver function 
and moderate clinically relevant portal hypertension 
(hepatic venous pressure gradient > 10 mmHg) yields 
competitive survival outcomes (21).
However, surgical indications for HCC are 
decided not only by selection criteria included in each 
treatment algorithm, as mentioned above, but also by 
tumor location, estimated liver resection volume, and 
liver functional reserve. Although there are several 
algorithms to guide secure hepatic resection, the 
detailed operative indication and procedure should be 
determined by well-experienced hepatobiliary surgeons 
in accordance with the condition of each patient.
Ablation
Image-guided percutaneous ablation therapies mainly 
mention ethanol injection (22), microwave ablation 
(MWA) (23), and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) (24). 
Of these, RFA is recommended first in all guidelines, 
and ethanol injection is a treatment of choice only in 
cases in which RFA cannot be performed safely because 
of either enterobiliary reflux or adhesion between the 
tumor and the gastrointestinal tract. Recently, MWA 
has been utilized more frequently because application 
of higher temperatures in a shorter period of time has 
led to excellent local tumor control and less concern for 
heat sink (25), and the AASLD guidelines recommend 
MWA as a choice of local ablation therapy. However, 
there are no prospective randomized trials comparing 
RFA with MWA.
The indication of local ablation therapy is almost 
the same among the various guidelines described above. 
Local ablation therapy is mainly performed on patients 
with small HCC, generally in Child-Pugh class A or B 
patients with three or fewer tumors, each 3 cm or less in 
diameter. In the Hong Kong guidelines, local ablation 
is indicated for solitary tumors within 5 cm in size. The 
combination of ablation and TACE is recommended for 
solitary tumors measuring 3-7 cm in diameter as per the 
Chinese guidelines (26).
TACE
TACE is recommended as a first-line treatment of 
HCC for patients with unresectable, large or multifocal 
HCCs, which do not have vascular invasion or 
extrahepatic spread, namely equivalent to BCLC stage

(289)
B patients (27). Therefore, the guidelines published 
by the EASL-EORTC and AASLD recommend TACE 
as a first-line, non-curative therapy for BCLC stage B 
patients, although only systemic therapy is indicated for 
patients with vascular invasion according to the EASL￾EORTC and AASLD recommendations.
On the other hand, TACE is a treatment option 
for lesions with vascular invasion according to the 
Asian guidelines. TACE is indicated for lesions with 
vascular invasion at the peripheral portal branch as per 
Japanese and Hong Kong guidelines (28), and even for 
lesions with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) at the 
main trunk in Chinese guidelines as long as collateral 
circulation is well developed, although temporary liver 
decompensation and postembolization syndrome were 
noted to occur frequently (29). In APASL guidelines, 
TACE is recommended as the second-line therapy 
for tumors with vascular invasion, whereas systemic 
therapy is indicated as the first-line therapy. In addition, 
TACE alone or in combination with radiotherapy for 
patients with extrahepatic metastasis can be an option 
in China guidelines based on some retrospective 
observational studies (30), although there is insufficient 
evidence of a recommendation for TACE over systemic 
therapy for advanced HCC.
For patients with multiple and/or portal invasion, 
TARE is recommended in the Chinese and AASLD 
guidelines. In Japan, TARE is not included in national 
insurance and is therefore not commonly performed. 
Instead, hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) 
is commonly recommended for patients with multiple 
and/or portal invasion without indication of liver 
resection and TACE.
Systemic chemotherapy
Basically, systemic therapy is recommended over 
no therapy for patients with advanced HCC with 
macrovascular invasion and/or metastatic disease in 
all guidelines. In addition, systemic therapy is also 
indicated for multiple tumors (> 3 in number) in the 
Japanese and Chinese guidelines, and the APASL 
treatment algorithm recommends systemic therapy for 
TACE candidates as a second-line treatment according 
to the concept of conversion from TACE to sorafenib 
before the appearance of macrovascular invasion 
or extrahepatic metastasis (31). Systemic therapy is 
also indicated for tumors that are refractory to other 
locoregional therapy in all guidelines. In terms of liver 
function, systemic therapy is indicated only for patients 
with Child-Pugh A in Japan and EASL-EORTC, and 
for patients with Child-Pugh A and well-selected Child￾Pugh B in China, Hong Kong, and AASLD.
First-line agents used for systemic therapy are 
sorafenib in Hong Kong and APASL, sorafenib and 
FOLFOX 4 in China, and sorafenib and lenvatinib 
in Japan, AASLD, and EASL-EORTC. As second￾line therapy, regorafenib is recommended in Japan 
and EASL-EORTC, and regorafenib and nivolmab are 
recommended in AASLD. The differences among the 
agents used for systemic therapy should be interpreted 
in consideration with the recent rapid advance of 
antitumor drugs for HCC systemic therapy, including 
molecular targeted agents and immune checkpoint 
inhibitors.
In a latest report, Finn et al. reported the superiority 
of atezolizumab-bevacizumab to sorafenib in patients 
with advanced unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma 
not previously treated with systemic therapy (32). 
Atezolizumab is a programmed death ligand 1 (PD￾L1) inhibitor, and bevacizumab is a monoclonal 
antibody targeting vascular endothelial growth factor. 
Treatment with the combination of atezolizumab￾bevacizumab resulted in significantly longer overall 
survival at 12 months (67.2% [95% CI, 61.3 to 73.1] 
with atezolizumab–bevacizumab and 54.6% [95% 
CI, 45.2 to 64.0] with sorafenib, and progression-free 
survival (median progression-free survival, 6.8 months 
[95% CI, 5.7 to 8.3] with atezolizumab–bevacizumab 
and 4.3 months [95% CI, 4.0 to 5.6] with sorafenib). 
The confirmed objective response rates were 27.3% 
(95% CI, 22.5 to 32.5) with atezolizumab–bevacizumab 
and 11.9% (95% CI, 7.4 to 18.0) with sorafenib. The 
combination of atezolizumab-bevacizumab might be a 
new benchmark for first-line therapy in advanced HCC. 
This evidence will be included in each guideline in the 
near future.
Liver transplantation
Thus far, the two major accepted criteria for liver 
transplantation have been the Milan criteria (solitary 
tumor ≤ 5 cm or within 3 nodules ≤ 3 cm without 
vascular invasion and extrahepatic metastasis) (16) 
and the UCSF criteria (solitary tumor ≤ 6.5 cm or ≤ 
3 nodules ≤ 4.5 cm plus total tumor diameter ≤ 8 cm 
without vascular invasion and extrahepatic metastasis) 
(33). The Milan criteria have been adopted in Japan, 
Hong Kong, APASL, EASL-EORTC, and AASLD as 
the first-line criteria, and the UCSF criteria are used in 
China as the first-line and in Hong Kong and APASL as 
the second-line. Although the expansion of the Milan 
criteria is not recommended by the Japan and AASLD 
guidelines, the recently updated EASL-EORTC and 
AASLD guidelines suggest that patients beyond the 
Milan criteria can be candidates for transplantation after 
successful down-staging into the Milan criteria (34). 
In the Japanese 2017 guidelines with minor revision in 
2019, new expanded criteria for LDLT candidates with 
HCC, the 5-5-500 rule (nodule size ≤ 5 cm in diameter, 
nodule number ≤ 5, and alfa-fetoprotein value ≤ 500 
ng/ml), were established based on a retrospective data 
analysis of the Japanese nationwide survey (10).
Although each guideline has adopted the Milan or 
www.globalhealthmedicine.com

Global Health & Medicine. 2020; 2(5):282-291. Global Health & Medicine. 2020; 2(5):282-291.
UCSF criteria, the difference in graft sources between 
the East and West should be taken into consideration. 
Briefly, living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is the 
mainstay in Eastern countries, whereas deceased-donor 
liver transplantation (DDLT) is prevalent in Western 
countries (35). Unlike DDLT, LDLT is not restricted by 
the nationwide allocation system, and the indication for 
LDLT in patients with HCC should be decided based on 
institutional or case-by-case consideration, balancing 
the burden on the donor, operative risk, and overall 
survival benefit for the recipient.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the differences in treatment strategy 
for hepatocellular carcinoma between the updated 
guidelines in Japan, China, Hong Kong, APASL, 
EASL-EORTC, and AASLD are summarized. 
Variations in the treatment algorithms between the 
guidelines is inevitable considering the differences 
in the prevalence and etiology of HCC, local clinical 
practice, and medical and insurance systems between 
countries or regions, and this might be confusing for 
practitioners worldwide. The present review provides 
comprehensive understanding of existing guidelines 
worldwide and it may be useful for future improvement 
of each guideline.
