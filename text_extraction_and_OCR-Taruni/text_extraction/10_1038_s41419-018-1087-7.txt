Abstract
Current therapeutic options for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) are very limited, which is largely attributed to
poor understanding of molecular pathogenesis of ICC. Breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein-associated protein-1
(BAP1) has been reported to be a broad-spectrum tumor suppressor in many tumor types, yet its role in ICC remains
unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical implications and biological function of BAP1 in ICC. Our
results showed that the messenger RNA and protein levels of BAP1 were significantly downregulated in ICC versus
paired non-tumor tissues. Overexpression of wild-type but not mutant BAP1 significantly suppressed ICC cell
proliferation, cell cycle progression, and invasion in vitro, as well as tumor progression in vivo. Conversely, knockdown
of BAP1 yielded opposing effects. Mechanistically, BAP1 functioned as a tumor suppressor in ICC by inhibiting the
extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase/c-Jun pathways, and this function was abolished
by inactivating mutations. Clinically, low BAP1 expression was positively correlated with aggressive tumor
characteristics, such as larger tumor size, presence of lymphatic metastasis, and advanced tumor node metastasis
stage. Survival analysis revealed that low BAP1 expression was significantly and independently associated with poor
overall survival and relapse-free survival after curative surgery. In conclusion, BAP1 is a putative tumor suppressor of
ICC, and may serve as a valuable prognostic biomarker as well as potential therapeutic target for ICC.
Background
Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), arising from
the malignant transformation of intrahepatic cholangio￾cytes, is the second most common primary hepatic
malignancy1–3
. As one of the most aggressive tumors, the
incidence and mortality of ICC have been rapidly
increasing worldwide, with geographic variation4,5
.
Surgical resection remains the mainstay of potentially
curative therapy for patients with ICC, but the resect￾ability rate is quite low because of the high frequency of
metastases6,7
. Even worse, no effective chemotherapies or
molecular target therapies are available for ICC, which is
mainly attributed to poor understanding of the molecular
pathogenesis of this malignancy8–10. Therefore, a better
understanding of the molecular mechanisms associated
with ICC progression would benefit the development of
new effective treatment modalities.
The ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) is an essential
and highly regulated system in charge of 80–90% protein
degradation and turnover, which is central to keeping

intracellular protein homeostasis and regulating cellular
function11. Many key proteins regulated by UPS are
involved in tumor onset and progression, and mutations in
UPS genes are implicated in various types of cancer12–14.
Similar to protein phosphorylation, protein ubiquitination
is a highly reversible process, and it can be reversed by a
class of isopeptidases known as deubiquitinating enzymes
(DUBs), which are involved in numerous biological pro￾cesses, including transcriptional regulation, cell growth
and differentiation, and oncogenesis15,16.
Breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1)-
associated protein-1 (BAP1) was originally identified as a
novel DUB interacting with the RING finger domain of
BRCA117. It is a member of the ubiquitin carboxy￾terminal hydrolase (UCH) subfamily of DUBs, and plays
critical roles in key cellular processes including tran￾scription, cell cycle regulation, cell differentiation, cell
death, and DNA damage response13,18,19. BAP1 has been
considered a true tumor suppressor and appears to follow
a classic Knudson two-hit paradigm20,21. Germline or
somatic mutations and deletions of BAP1 have been
identified in various tumor types, and downregulation or
inactivation of BAP1 could accelerate tumor onset, inva￾sion, recurrence, and metastases13,22–27. Meanwhile,
genetic evidence from mouse models carrying hetero￾zygous germline BAP1 mutations showed that BAP1 was
a bona fide tumor suppressor and mutant BAP1 mouse
models exhibited a high incidence of neoplasms, including
ovarian sex cord stromal tumors, lung carcinomas, and
breast carcinomas, and so on28.
Recently, a relative high mutation frequency of BAP1
was identified in ICC by several exome sequencing pro￾jects29,30. Because of the implied significance of BAP1,
we were compelled to investigate the clinical significance
and biological function of BAP1 in ICC. In this study,
we found that BAP1 was significantly downregulated
in ICC, and its decreased expression correlated with
poor overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival
(RFS) after curative surgery. Furthermore, results of
functional assays indicated that BAP1 controlled ICC
cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and invasion
in vitro, as well as tumor progression in vivo, by mod￾ulating the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2
(ERK1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-Jun
pathways. Therefore, we proposed that BAP1 is a putative
tumor suppressor in ICC, and may serve as a valuable
prognostic biomarker as well as a potential therapeutic
target in ICC.
Results
BAP1 is downregulated in human ICC and correlates with
lymphatic metastasis
To explore the potential role of BAP1 in ICC, we first
evaluated messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of BAP1 in
60 paired ICC samples and matched adjacent non-tumor
liver tissues. The results showed that BAP1 mRNA
expression was downregulated in 73.3% (44/60) of ICC
tissues, relative to the adjacent non-tumor liver tissues
(P = 0.039) (Fig. 1a). Western blot assays in 12 paired ICC
tumor and adjacent non-tumor liver tissues showed
similar results (Fig. 1b). Then, tissue microarray (TMA)
assay was performed to detect the expression of BAP1 in
ICC. Immunohistochemical data indicated that BAP1
was scored as a negative or weak expression in 53.7%
(115/214) of tumor tissues, as compared with only 33.2%
(71/214) in corresponding adjacent normal intrahepatic
biliary tissues (Fig. 1c).
Compared to other tumor types, lymphatic metastasis is
more prevalent in ICC and is an important predictive
factor for poor prognosis31. Therefore, we analyzed
another 12 independent ICC samples with (n = 6) or
without lymphatic metastasis (n = 6), and found that
BAP1 mRNA and protein expression were even lower in
ICC with lymphatic metastasis than in those without
lymphatic metastasis (Fig. 1d).
Low BAP1 expression correlates with aggressive
clinicopathological characteristics and poor prognosis
after surgery in ICC
For the whole population of the 214 ICC patients, the
1-year, 3-year, 5-year, and 7-year OS and RFS rates were
58.4% and 57.8%, 31.7% and 33.4%, 22.1% and 27.8%,
and 13.1% and 22.3%, respectively. To investigate the
clinical implications of BAP1 in ICC, all the 214
ICC patients were dichotomized as BAP1low (scored
as negative or weak, n = 115) and BAP1high (scored as
moderate or strong, n = 99), according to the immu￾nohistochemical data. Low BAP1 expression was
significantly correlated with high serum CA19-9 level
(P = 0.001) and aggressive tumor characteristics, such as
larger tumor size (P = 0.010), presence of lymphatic
metastasis (P < 0.001), and advanced tumor node
metastasis (TNM) stage (P = 0.005) (Table 1). Low
BAP1 expression was significantly associated with poor
OS and RFS after curative surgery (Fig. 1e). Median OS
and RFS in patients in the BAP1low group were sig￾nificantly shorter than patients in the BAP1high group
(OS, 10.5 versus 29.0 months, P < 0.001; RFS, 12.0 versus
23.0 months, P = 0.002). Of note, multivariate analysis,
using Cox proportional hazards regression model
adopting all significant variables in univariate analyses,
confirmed that low BAP1 expression was an indepen￾dent prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.67,
95% confidence interval (CI): 1.20–2.32, P = 0.002) and
RFS (HR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.04–2.22, P = 0.031) (Table 2).
Collectively, these data clearly indicated that low BAP1
expression was a valuable predicting factor for dismal
prognosis after curative surgery in ICC patients.

Downregulation of BAP1 promotes proliferation, cell cycle
progression, and invasion of ICC in vitro
The clinical implications of BAP1 in ICC compelled us
to explore its exact biological function. HCCC9810, a
BAP1low ICC cell line, was transfected with lentiviral
vector encoding wild-type BAP1 to generate an ICC cell
line with stable overexpression of BAP1 (HCCC9810-
BAP1) and compared with its control (HCCC9810-
Mock). RBE, a BAP1high ICC cell line, was transfected
with lentiviral vector encoding short hairpin BAP1
(shBAP1) to establish an ICC cell line with stable
downregulation of BAP1 (RBE-shBAP1) and compared
with its control (RBE-Mock) (Fig. 2a). BAP1 over￾expression and downregulation efficiency were confirmed
using real-time quantitative reverse transcription
PCR (qRT-PCR), western blot (Fig. 2a), and immuno￾fluorescence (Supplementary Figure S1).
First, in the proliferation analysis using the
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bro￾mide assay, overexpression of BAP1 in HCCC9810 cells
led to significant inhibition of cell proliferation. In con￾trast, proliferation of RBE-shBAP1 cells was significantly

enhanced compared to its control (Fig. 2b). Further cell
cycle analysis revealed that overexpression of BAP1 in
HCCC9810 cells significantly reduced cells in the S phase
and arrested cells in the G0/G1 phase, which suggested
that overexpression of BAP1 resulted in decreased
G1-phase to S-phase cell cycle progression. Conversely,
markedly increased G1-phase to S-phase cell cycle pro￾gression was detected in RBE cells after downregulation of
BAP1 (Fig. 2c). Moreover, both scratching assay and
Matrigel invasion assay indicated that overexpression of
BAP1 in HCCC9810 cells significantly reduced cell
migratory and invasion capacities, while the motility and
invasion potential of RBE-shBAP1 cells were evidently
enhanced compared to RBE-Mock cells (Fig. 2d, e). Taken
together, these data revealed that downregulation of BAP1
promotes proliferation, G1 to S cell cycle progression, and
invasion of ICC in vitro.
Downregulation of BAP1 promotes ICC progression in vivo
Subsequently, mouse subcutaneous xenograft models
were used to examine the effect of BAP1 on ICC pro￾gression in vivo. Tumor growth curves showed that
tumors derived from HCCC9810-Mock and RBE-shBAP1
cells grew evidently faster than those from HCCC9810-
BAP1 and RBE-Mock cells over the same period,
respectively (Fig. 2f). Likewise, tumor volume of xeno￾grafts derived from HCCC9810-Mock and RBE-shBAP1
cells were 114.25 ± 30.02 and 365.45 ± 161.84 mm3
,
respectively, markedly larger than the volume of tumors
derived from HCCC9810-BAP1 and RBE-Mock cells
(44.65 ± 16.99 and 148.86 ± 70.07 mm3
, P = 0.002 and
P = 0.025, respectively). Similarly, tumor weight of xeno￾grafts derived from HCCC9810-BAP1 and RBE-Mock
cells were significantly lighter than those of tumors
derived from HCCC9810-Mock and RBE-shBAP1 cells
(Fig. 2f). Together, these data suggested that down￾regulation of BAP1 promoted ICC progression in vivo.
BAP1 regulates ICC cell proliferation, cell cycle
progression, and invasion via inhibiting ERK1/2 and JNK/c￾Jun signaling pathways
ERK1/2 and JNK/c-Jun signaling pathways play vital
roles in many physiological processes including cell pro￾liferation, differentiation, survival, and death, and persis￾tent activation of ERK1/2 and JNK/c-Jun signaling has
been observed in a high percentage of cancers, including
ICC32,33. Moreover, UCHs have been reported to exert
their functions in oncogenesis through modulating
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling
pathways34. Therefore, we wondered whether BAP1, as an
important member of UCHs, functioned in ICC through
regulating ERK1/2 and JNK/c-Jun signaling pathways. As
expected, western blot analysis showed that the phos￾phorylation of ERK1/2, JNK, and c-Jun were significantly
downregulated in HCCC9810-BAP1 and RBE-Mock cells
as compared to HCCC9810-Mock and RBE-shBAP1 cells,
respectively (Fig. 3a, b). We further investigated the
phosphorylation level of ERK1/2, JNK, and c-Jun in TMAs
containing 214 ICC patients. Consistently, the

immunohistochemical results also showed a significant
negative correlation of expression of BAP1 with the
phosphorylation level of ERK1/2, JNK, and c-Jun (Fig. 3c,
d). Then, we transfected one inactive mutant BAP1C91A
plasmid into HCCC9810 cells, producing HCCC9810-
BAP1C91A cells. Western blot assays showed that the
phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK, and c-Jun were sig￾nificantly downregulated in HCCC9810-BAP1 cells but
not in HCCC9810-BAP1C91A cells, as compared to
HCCC9810-Mock cells (Fig. 4a, b). Likewise, cell pro￾liferation, G1-phase to S-phase cell cycle progression, and
invasion of HCCC9810 cells were significantly inhibited
by transfection of wild-type BAP1 but not inactive mutant
BAP1C91A (Fig. 4c, d). Consistently, the in vivo study also
suggested that overexpression of wild-type BAP1 but not
inactive mutant BAP1C91A evidently inhibited ICC pro￾gression, and the immunohistochemical results also con￾firmed that the inhibition of ERK1/2 and JNK/c-Jun
signaling pathways were mediated by wild-type BAP1 but
not by inactive mutant BAP1C91A (Fig. 4e, f). These
results indicated that BAP1 suppressed ICC cell pro￾liferation, cell cycle progression, and invasion via inhi￾biting ERK1/2 and JNK/c-Jun signaling pathways.
To further validate these findings, we used inhibitors of
the ERK1/2 pathway (U0126) and JNK/c-Jun pathway
(SP600125) in RBE-shBAP1 cells. Western blot analysis
was performed to assess the effect of U0126 and
SP600125 on the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK, and c￾Table 2 Univariate and multivariate analyses of prognostic factors in 214 ICC patients

Jun. As expected, both the inhibitors successfully sup￾pressed the phosphorylation of the corresponding pro￾teins (Fig. 5a, b). More importantly, cell proliferation, G1-
phase to S-phase cell cycle progression, and invasion of
RBE-shBAP1 cells were significantly inhibited after
treatment with either U0126 or SP600125 (Fig. 5c, d).
Consistently, the in vivo study also suggested that inhi￾bition of ERK1/2 or JNK/c-Jun signaling pathways using
U0126 or SP600125 abrogated the pro-ICC effect induced
by BAP1 downregulation (Fig. 5e, f). These data clearly
suggested that hyperactivity of ERK1/2 and JNK/c-Jun
signaling induced by BAP1 downregulation is necessary
for ICC cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and
invasion. All of these results further confirmed that
BAP1 suppressed ICC cell proliferation, cell cycle pro￾gression, and invasion via inhibiting ERK1/2 and JNK/c￾Jun signaling pathways.
Discussion
In the present study, we investigated the clinical sig￾nificance, biological function, and the underlying mechan￾isms of BAP1 in ICC pathogenesis and progression.
Our data demonstrated that BAP1 is a potential tumor
suppressor in ICC. More importantly, our results also
confirmed that BAP1 deficiency increased the phosphor￾ylation and activity of ERK1/2 and JNK/c-Jun signaling to
promote ICC progression. Our findings of the functional
characterization of BAP1 in ICC may provide a novel
potential therapeutic target for future drug development.
In this study, our data showed that BAP1 expression
was significantly downregulated in ICC. Consistently,
results from previous studies in other types of cancer,
including uveal melanoma, clear-cell renal cell carcinoma,
gastric adenocarcinoma, colorectal cancer, and non￾small-cell lung cancer, also documented a significant
decrease in tumor BAP1 expression35–39. Notably, low
expression of BAP1 significantly correlated with larger
tumor size, presence of lymphatic metastasis, and
advanced TNM stage, which are all predictors of poor
prognosis of ICC after curative surgery5,7
. More impor￾tantly, our results showed that ICC patients with low
BAP1 expression in general had worse prognosis than
those with high BAP1 expression. The findings are in
accordance with previous reports that reduced expression
or inactivation of BAP1 in tumors, which often results
from germline-inactivating or somatic-inactivating BAP1
mutations or deletions, increases tumor susceptibility, or
predicts worse clinical outcomes13,22–27,29. Hence, we
believe that BAP1 is a candidate biomarker for prognostic
prediction as well as a novel therapeutic target for ICC
patients.
Our in vitro experiments showed that ectopic expres￾sion of wild-type but not inactive mutant BAP1 drama￾tically suppressed, while knockdown of BAP1 promoted,
cell proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities in ICC
cell lines. These results were highly consistent with other
previous studies, in which growth-inhibiting and
invasion-suppressing effects of BAP1 were reported13,40.
Further, cell cycle analysis revealed that upregulation of
wild-type but not inactive mutant BAP1 evidently reduced
cells in the S phase, while arresting cells in the G0/G1
phase. Similarly, downregulation of BAP1 markedly
increased cells in the S phase and reduced cells in the G0/
G1 phase, consistent with the results of a recent study that
depletion of BAP1 resulted in a modest accumulation of
host cell factor 1, which promoted the transition from G1
to S phase41. Furthermore, our in vivo data confirmed that
overexpression of wild-type but not inactive mutant
BAP1 significantly inhibited, while knockdown of BAP1
promoted, ICC tumorigenicity, and progression. These
in vitro and in vivo functional results thereby highlighted
the tumor-suppressive role of BAP1 in ICC.
The MAPK protein family coordinately regulates a wide
array of physiological and pathological processes, and
aberrant MAPK signaling plays a crucial role in the
development and progression of cancer, as well as in
determining responses to cancer treatment42. As impor￾tant members of MAPKs, hyperactivity of ERK1/2 and
JNK/c-Jun signaling has been observed in a high percen￾tage of cancers, including ICC32,33. Moreover, accumu￾lating data have revealed that UCHs exert their functions
in tumor onset and progression via regulating MAPK
signaling pathways34. Hence, we hypothesized that BAP1
exerted its biological functions in ICC through
modulating ERK1/2 and JNK/c-Jun signaling. As expec￾ted, we indeed found that phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and

JNK/c-Jun was inhibited by wild-type but not mutant
BAP1 in ICC, as shown by western blotting and immu￾nohistochemistry. Moreover, the immunohistochemical
results in ICC patients demonstrated a significantly
negative correlation of BAP1 with p-ERK1/2, p-JNK, and
p-c-Jun, which further confirmed these findings. ERK1/2
is activated by phosphorylation of threonine 202/tyrosine
204 and threonine 185/tyrosine 187, whereas c-Jun is
activated by phosphorylation of serines 63 and 73. Phos￾phorylation of ERK1/2 and c-Jun induces activation of
many transcription factors, such as ETS, NF-κB, and AP-1,
resulting in the induction of downstream signal molecules,
c-Myc, cyclin D1, and c-Fos, which are important cell￾proliferating and growth-regulating factors42. Aberrant
activation of ERK1/2, c-Jun, or their downstream targets
has been reported to act as proto-oncogenes mediating
cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, as well as
increasing cancer cell migratory and invasion capa￾cities42,43. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that
hyperactivity of ERK1/2 and JNK/c-Jun signaling induced
by BAP1 downregulation was necessary for ICC cell
proliferation, cell cycle progression, and invasion in vitro
and in vivo using the inhibitors of the ERK1/2 pathway
(U0126) and JNK/c-Jun pathway (SP600125). Taken
together, our data suggested that BAP1 negatively regu￾lated the ERK1/2 and JNK/c-Jun signaling pathways to
exert its tumor-suppressive functions in ICC. However,
the detailed mechanisms of the upstream of MAPK cas￾cade regulated by BAP1 in ICC need further exploration.
In summary, our study demonstrated that BAP1, which
is frequently downregulated in ICC, was a putative tumor
suppressor in human ICC. The tumor-suppressive effects
of BAP1 proceeded by antagonizing the activity of the
ERK1/2 and JNK/c-Jun signaling pathways. Importantly,
downregulation of BAP1 promoted aggressive behavior of
ICC, and BAP1 also served as a novel prognostic indicator
for ICC patients after curative surgery. The clinical rele￾vance and functional significance of BAP1 in ICC support
its exploration as a promising therapeutic target for ICC.
Materials and methods
Patients and specimens
Human liver tissues were obtained from specimens of
ICC patients undergoing curative surgery in the Depart￾ment of Liver Surgery, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan Uni￾versity. A total of 60 pairs of snap-frozen ICC samples and
matched adjacent non-tumor liver tissues were collected
for detecting mRNA expression of BAP1, and 12 pairs
were obtained for detecting protein expression of BAP1.
Another 12 snap-frozen ICC samples from patients with
or without lymph node metastasis were randomly
retrieved for the analysis of BAP1 mRNA and protein
expression.
Archived paraffin-embedded tumor tissues from 214
consecutive ICC patients treated with curative resection
between February 2001 and December 2006 were used for
TMA construction and immunohistochemistry. The
entrance criteria, clinical data collection, and post￾operative follow-up procedures were conducted according
to uniform guidelines described in our previous study44.
Histopathological diagnosis was based on World Health
Organization criteria. Tumor stage was determined in
accordance with the TNM classification system estab￾lished by the 2010 International Union Against Cancer45.
OS was defined as the interval between the date of surgery
and the date of death. RFS was defined as the interval
between the date of surgery and the date of tumor
relapse44.
The study was approved by the research ethics com￾mittee of Zhongshan Hospital, and informed consent was
obtained from each patient according to the institutional
review board protocols.
TMA construction and immunohistochemistry
TMAs were constructed as described in our previous
study44. Immunohistochemical staining was performed
using the avidin–biotin–peroxidase complex method as
described previously44. The primary antibodies and dilu￾tions used were listed in Supplementary Table S1.

Immunostaining intensities of these markers were semi￾quantitatively scored as follows: 0, negative; 1, weak; 2,
moderate; 3, strong. The score of immunostaining
intensity was assessed by two pathologists independently,
and comparisons were performed between tumor/normal
pairs. In the survival analyses, scores 0 and 1 were defined
as low expression, whereas scores 2 and 3 were defined as
high expression45,46.
Cell lines and transfection
Two human ICC cell lines, HCCC9810 (Chinese
Academy of Sciences Shanghai Branch Cell Bank,
Shanghai, China) and RBE (Cell Resource Center of
Tohoku University, Tohoku, Japan), were used in this
study. The cell lines were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium
(Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) and
penicillin/streptomycin. Lentiviral vector encoding wild￾type BAP1 for overexpression of BAP1 was transfected
into HCCC9810 cells and designated as HCCC9810-
BAP1 cells. HCCC9810-Mock cells, which were trans￾fected with lentiviral vector alone, were used as control.
Lentiviral vector encoding shBAP1 for downregulation of
BAP1 was transfected into RBE cells and designated as
RBE-shBAP1 cells. The target sequence of shBAP1 was
listed in Supplementary Table S2. RBE-Mock cells, which
were transfected with lentiviral vector alone, were used as
control. After a series of preliminary studies, dose and
time of U0126 (Selleckchem, Houston, TX, USA) on RBE￾shBAP1 cells were selected as 10 μM and 1 h, respectively;
dose and time of SP600125 (Selleckchem, Houston, TX,
USA) on RBE-shBAP1 cells were selected as 20 μM and 1
h, respectively. Catalytically inactive mutant BAP1C91A
was cloned into pcDNA3.1 vector and transfected into
HCCC9810 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) reagent following the manufacturer’s
instructions for the in vitro study47. Moreover, lentiviral
vector encoding inactive mutant BAP1C91A for over￾expression of BAP1C91A was transfected into HCCC9810
cells for the in vivo study. Stably transfected clones were
validated by qRT-PCR and western blot analysis.
Cell proliferation, cell cycle, scratching, Matrigel invasion,
western blot, immunofluorescence, and qRT-PCR assays
Cell proliferation, cell cycle, scratching, and Matrigel
invasion assays were performed as described previously44.
Protein from ICC cells or snap-frozen specimens were
extracted using RIPA buffer, and protein expression was
analyzed by western blot as described previously44.
Immunofluorescence assay were also performed as pre￾viously described45. The primary antibodies and dilutions
used were listed in Supplementary Table S1. Total RNA
was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) and reverse transcribed to cDNA using
PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (Takara, Japan). SYBR Pre￾mix Ex TaqTM (Takara, Japan) was used for qRT-PCR
following the manufacturer’s instructions, and gene
amplification and detection were performed using the ABI
PRISM 7900 Sequence Detection System (Applied Bio￾systems, Foster City, CA, USA). Gene-specific primers
were designed as follows: BAP1 forward, 5′-GACCC
AGGCCTCTTCACC-3′; BAP1 reverse, 5′-AGTCCTTCA
TGCGACTCAGG-3′; GAPDH forward, 5′-AGCCACA
TCGCTCAGACAC-3′; GAPDH reverse, 5′-GAATTT
GCCATGGGTGGA-3′.
In vivo assays
Male non-obese diabetic-severe combined immunode￾ficiency (NOD/SCID) mice (4 weeks old) were purchased
from the Shanghai Institute of Material Medicine of the
Chinese Academy of Science and raised under specific
pathogen-free conditions. Animal care and experimental
protocols were conducted in accordance with guidelines
established by the Shanghai Medical Experimental Animal
Care Commission. Ethical approval was obtained from the
research ethics committee of Zhongshan Hospital.
HCCC9810-BAP1, HCCC9810-Mock, HCCC9810-
BAP1C91A, RBE-shBAP1, and RBE-Mock cells (5 × 106
)
were suspended in 200 μL serum-free RPMI-1640 and
Matrigel (BD Biosciences; 1:1), and then injected sub￾cutaneously into the flanks of NOD/SCID mice. Inhibi￾tion of ERK1/2 or JNK/c-Jun signaling pathways was
performed by intraperitoneal injections of 25 μM/kg
U0126 or 50 μM/kg SP600125 thrice a week from day 15
after inoculation, respectively. Inhibition of ERK1/2 or
JNK/c-Jun signaling pathways was confirmed at the end of
study using immunohistochemistry. The tumor volume
was measured every 3 days with a caliper and calculated in
mm3 using the following formula: V = length × width2
/2.
Upon euthanizing the mice, the tumors were removed,
weighed, and photographed.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version
18.0 for Windows. Categorical data were analyzed using
the χ2 test or Fisher's exact test and quantitative data were
analyzed using the Student’s t test or one-way analysis of
variance, when appropriate. OS and RFS curves were
plotted using the Kaplan–Meier method and compared
using the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate ana￾lyses were performed using the Cox proportional hazards
regression model. Two-tailed P values < 0.05 were con￾sidered statistically significant.
