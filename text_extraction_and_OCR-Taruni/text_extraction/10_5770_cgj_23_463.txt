ROCKWOOD & THEOU: ALLOCATING SCARCE HC RESOURCES
CANADIAN GERIATRICS JOURNAL, VOLUME 23, ISSUE 3, SEPTEMBER 2020 254
ABSTRACT 
The key idea behind the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) is that, 
as people age, they are more likely to have things wrong with 
them. Those things they have wrong (health deficits) can, 
as they accumulate, erode their ability to do the high order 
functions which define their overall health. These high order 
functions include being able to: think and do as they please; 
look after themselves; interact with other people; and move 
about without falling. The Clinical Frailty Scale brings that 
information together in one place. This paper is a guide for 
people new to the Clinical Frailty Scale. It also introduces an 
updated version (CFS version 2.0), with revised level names 
(e.g., “vulnerable” becomes “living with very mild frailty”) 
and minor edits to level descriptions. The key points discussed 
are that the Clinical Frailty Scale assays the baseline state, it 
is not widely validated in younger people or those with stable 
single-system disabilities, and it requires clinical judgement. 
The Clinical Frailty Scale is now commonly used as a triage 
tool to make important clinical decisions such as allocating 
scarce health care resources for COVID-19 management; 
therefore, it is important that the scale is used appropriately.
Key words: frailty, Clinical Frailty Scale, ageing
Why This Paper?
This short paper is meant to be a guide for people new to 
the Clinical Frailty Scale. It should be seen as supplement￾ing, not competing with, the many useful guides that have 
become available, especially in the setting of the COVID-19 
pandemic. This work builds on existing resources about how 
to use the scale. Here we will discuss what frailty is, how the 
Clinical Frailty Scale arose, how it works now, and what can 
be done to check on its reliability and usefulness (both sit 
within the traditional notion of validity). We will introduce an 
updated version (CFS version 2.0) with revised level names 
and minor edits to level descriptions (Figure 1). We will also 
suggest some steps that may be helpful to those who wish to 
use frailty for assessment rather than for screening. These are 
meant to complement, not replace, their individual disciplin￾ary approach. Finally, we will reflect on what we have learned 
about using the Clinical Frailty Scale over the years, and on 
the frailty discourse that began long before the Scale was de￾veloped. Most is grounded in evidence; that which is specula￾tive we hope will be useful, if only for hypothesis generation. 
The Clinical Frailty Scale is being used in many settings 
to help guide decisions that are based on the degree of frailty. 
That is neither rare nor, on its own, undesirable. Care plans 
should vary by the degree of frailty—for example, by the 
ability to climb stairs before being discharged, or to under￾take (versus be assisted with) personal care. The COVID-19 
pandemic brings with it an uncomfortable difference. With 
these assessments now come decisions about offering—or not 
offering—resources that are, or may become scarce, such as 
intubation or agents that increase blood pressure in someone 
in shock. Although rationing is not part of ordinary care, it is 
inevitable; if done properly, it can be made acceptable at the 
system level in the setting of a public health emergency.(1)
That being the case, many people less than familiar with 
the notion of frailty are now being called upon to conduct frailty 
assessments. This is challenging because the evaluation of 
people who are frail requires not only cognitive skills, but also 
the affective and attitudinal ones needed to work with people 
who have multiple, interacting medical and social problems.(2)
What Is Frailty?
Frailty is a state of increased risk.(3) Inasmuch as most health 
risks increase with age, a handy way to think about frailty is 
that it is a risk compared with others of the same age.* Like 
the risk of dying, on average frailty increases with age. People 
are frail when they have more things wrong with them than do

*This conforms to the statistical notion of frailty as variability in 
risk compared with others with the same degree of exposure. The 
scale is built on the idea of age-related deficit accumulation. People 
of the same age are at greater risk in virtue of having more health 
deficits than do others of the same age. The Clinical Frailty Scale 
maps the consequences of this that precede death: decrements in 
high order functions.

others of the same age. Although that might not seem like a 
big deal, it is a real challenge for how we deliver health care. 
Medicine’s tremendous success in treating people one illness 
at a time leads to the belief that is how people should get sick. 
As our population ages though, because frailty and age travel 
together, many of our patients have many things wrong at 
the same time. That is the challenge we face: their chance of 
having more things wrong with them increases as they age. 
As these health deficits accumulate, they have clinical 
consequences, including in how diseases present, how often 
more than one illness is active at a time, how people are able 
to tell us about their symptoms or cooperate with our exams, 
how drugs work, and how likely it is that we can succeed 
similar to when treating people who have just a single pre￾dominant illness. By understanding frailty and changing what 
we offer to meet the needs of people who live with it, we can 
face that challenge. The Clinical Frailty Scale, developed in 
Halifax, Nova Scotia in the 1990s, considers the things that 
most often go wrong as age-related health deficits accumulate.
(4) It robustly predicts adverse health outcomes in a variety of 
settings, including acute care.(5)
What is the Clinical Frailty Scale?
The Clinical Frailty Scale is an inclusive 9-point scale that was 
originally developed to summarize the overall level of fitness 
or frailty of an older adult after they had been evaluated by 
a health care professional. The scale is scored so that higher 
scores mean greater risk. It is not a questionnaire. Grading 
the degree of frailty requires clinical judgement that is based 
in part on screening criteria, and which then considers what 
broadly stratifies degrees of fitness and frailty. The scale fo￾cuses on items that can be readily observed without specialist 
training, including mobility, balance, use of walking aids, 
and the abilities to eat, dress, shop, cook, and bank. For this 
reason, scoring should match the description, and should not 
be based solely on the pictures that accompany each level.
The key to scoring the Clinical Frailty Scale is to de￾termine the person’s baseline health state. This is especially 
needed in clinical settings where health can change quickly. 
For example, many older patients in the Emergency Depart￾ment who were fit two weeks ago (their baseline state), may 
appear to be frail while ill; a prospect that becomes more 
likely the longer they wait there. Still, as discussed below, 
FIGURE 1. The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) version 2.0

their prognosis requires information about both their baseline 
degree of frailty, and the severity of their acute illness. 
In ordinary time (i.e., with no pandemic), the Clinical 
Frailty Scale is used both in prognosis and to set care goals. In 
geriatric medicine, goals of care extend much beyond the often 
desultory exercise of “getting the code status”. Usually much 
more relevant is understanding the baseline state and current 
decrements from it, which raise questions such as: “Does the 
patient have the manual dexterity to handle the mechanics of 
toileting? Do they need to climb stairs to get home?” If not, 
and depending on the capacity of whomever (if anyone) might 
be able to help them at discharge, goals of care need to be set 
in these domains. This information also facilitates prognosis: 
the greater the decline from the baseline state, the more energy 
it will take to recover. Given that intensity of effort may be 
limited by illness, this energy is often expressed as a function 
of time to recovery. Recovery time can be monitored from 
the start. It appears that the first 48 hours of hospitalization 
(preliminary data from Dr. Samuel D. Searle at our centre 
suggest up to 4 days in ICU patients) is information rich.(6)
Those who improve in how they move in bed do well; those 
who show decline fare especially poorly. In consequence, 
even recognizing the interplay between baseline frailty and 
severity of illness, many patients are well served by a trial 
of therapies. This provides a way to avoid the common, but 
false, dichotomy between “letting your father die” and “doing 
everything we can”.
In a pandemic, these nuances may be less relevant when 
an older person has become ill enough that admission to the 
intensive care unit is being considered. Critical illness car￾ries a clear age-related burden; in Italy, of the initial 18,366 
COVID-19 deaths, 83% were aged 70 years and older.(7) As in 
ordinary time, the stratification of risk must also consider the 
severity of illness.(8,9) In critically ill people with COVID-19, 
this appears to be substantial for adults aged 65+ years—the 
risk of death is more than 50% after 28 days.(10)
It is important to understand which older adults who are 
critically ill with COVID-19 disease might withstand both 
the illness and its treatment in an Intensive Care Unit. Inter￾national responses vary, but seem to settle around a Clinical 
Frailty Scale score of 5(11) to 6(12) or higher being excluded 
from ICU admission. 
Before reviewing how the scale is used, it is crucial 
to make a key additional point. The Clinical Frailty Scale, 
developed to study frailty in older adults, has largely not 
been validated in younger people. That is important because 
disability in younger people (including both acquired, as in 
spinal cord injury, and life-long, as in intellectual disability) 
does not have the same meaning for prognosis that it does 
with age-related disability. Understanding both this point and 
that the Clinical Frailty Scale is a judgement-based measure†
of the baseline state, we can proceed. 
The scale can be introduced by saying something like: 
“I’d like to know how you are [your parent is] doing overall.” 
We then ask about four features: how the person moved, 
functioned, thought, and felt about their health over the last 
two weeks. We can ask about which medications the person 
uses; experienced clinicians can quickly assay which illnesses 
are likely present from what medications are being prescribed 
and/or used. We also ask about how active the person is. 
Using the Clinical Frailty Scale to Grade Degrees 
of Fitness Prior to the Level of Risk Associated 
with Frailty 
How a person moves, functions, and think helps to delineate 
the first three levels of the scale. For example, consider a 
patient who is not impaired in any instrumental or personal 
activity of daily living (ADL), who is able to move read￾ily, and who is taking an angio-converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitor. If that person is taking the ACE inhibitor for treat￾ment of hypertension and exercises or engages in vigorous 
activity daily, their score would be Level 1– Very Fit. The 
same profile, with regular but less frequent or less vigorous 
physical activity would be scored as Level 2 – Fit (previously 
“Well”). Another person who fits the broad description and 
who is using the ACE inhibitor as part of post myocardial 
infarction management, but whose ischemic heart disease has 
been otherwise asymptomatic, would also be scored based 
on their degree of physical activity. If their symptoms were 
mostly controlled, but not entirely so, they would be scored 
as Level 3 – Managing Well. Likewise, a person on an ACE 
inhibitor as part of symptomatic management of congestive 
heart failure would be scored as Level 3 – Managing Well, 
as long as their symptoms did not limit activities, in which 
case they would be scored as Level 4 – Living with Very Mild 
Frailty (previously “Vulnerable”).
Using the Clinical Frailty Scale to Grade Clinically 
Meaningfully Increased Risk 
For Levels 4 to 7, mobility, function, and cognition are key 
factors. Each reflects high-order aspects of health: they inte￾grate a lot of information. This means that there are many ways 
to have mobility problems, for example: a sprained ankle, 
diabetic nerve damage, dehydration, heart failure, kidney 
damage or pneumonia. In consequence, these key domains 
are sensitive signs of health, but are not very specific. It is 
the combination of impaired function and impaired mobility, 
which are commonly accompanied by several illnesses, that 
make it likely someone is frail. 
Level 4 – previously “Vulnerable” is now Living with 
Very Mild Frailty, reflecting recent research with the Can￾adian Longitudinal Study of Aging that captures the increased 
risk with the corresponding degree of deficit accumulation.(13)
People with many chronic conditions often report incomplete 
symptom control, and of feeling “slowed up” or tired. A similar 
complaint is that their health stands in the way of doing as they 
wish, or that what they had done easily is now accomplished 
only with great effort. Otherwise, Level 4 is characterized by 
†Like many skills in clinical medicine, judgement should increase 
with time. Particularly at the start, if how to classify the person is 
not clear, ask a colleague whose judgement you trust.

the person who, although not completely dependent in perform￾ing daily activities, seems at risk of at least mild dependence. 
Identifiable characteristics of this risk include incomplete 
symptom control and a reduction in demanding activities. 
Problems with heavy housework, lifting (e.g., difficulty taking 
out the trash) or climbing more than a flight of stairs are useful 
signs. Although these activities might still be attempted, often 
they are not done as well or as often. When asked, “compared 
to others of your own age, how would you rate your health?”, 
many at this stage will no longer rate their health as “excellent” 
or even “good”, but rather as “fair” or “poor”.
Levels 5 to 7 relate to changes in function. Varying 
degrees of dependence in instrumental ADLs define Level 
5 – Living with Mild Frailty (previously “Mildly Frail”). At 
this level, typically, there is no more pretense of doing heavy 
housework or the like—items that began to be impaired in 
Level 4. A person does not need to be dependent in all de￾manding activities to qualify as Level 4, nor in all aspects of 
instrumental ADLs to qualify as Level 5. We are interested in 
change; someone who never did the banking would not now 
be scored as dependent in that. 
With Level 6 – Living with Moderate Frailty (previ￾ously “Moderately Frail”), dependence now extends past 
instrumental ADLs to intermediate ones, notably including 
dependence in bathing. Often at this level minimal assistance 
with personal care might be needed. Moderate dementia is the 
case when people who are dependent in their performance of 
instrumental ADLs can still do their basic or personal ADLs 
with prompting. This can also be the case in people who are 
cognitively intact, but whose disability obliges them to have 
someone nearby (so-called “standby assistance” or “set-up”). 
Again considering bathing, an example of moderate frailty 
might be requiring someone to draw the bath when the dis￾abled person has difficulty managing the taps, or assisting 
with transferring in and out of the tub, or washing their hair. 
Notably, a systematic review found that bathing disability is 
a risk factor for greater disability in personal ADLs.(14) 
Level 7 – Living with Severe Frailty (previously “Se￾verely Frail”) is characterized by progressive dependence in 
personal ADLs. People need not be dependent in every aspect 
of personal care to be scored as Level 7. When assessing 
functional dependence in intermediate (Level 6) and personal 
(Level 7) ADLs, lifelong habit is a less relevant consideration; 
most everyone needs to bathe, groom, and use the toilet. Still, 
people living with severe frailty can be mobile. Progressively 
taking to bed—but not being largely bedfast—is the hallmark 
of the progression of severe frailty. 
Using the Clinical Frailty Scale in People Towards 
the End of Life
The understanding of what happens at the end of life has 
evolved in relation to its association with ageing. Older people 
who are terminally ill are much more likely to receive formal 
palliative care if they have a diagnosis of cancer than if they 
have a disease with a recognized terminal phase, such as 
dementia or heart failure.(15)
Level 8 – Living with Very Severe Frailty (previously 
“Very Severely Frail”) is the not uncommon state in which 
a frail person takes to bed, often for weeks, prior to dying. 
This is either heralded by an identifiable episode, such as an 
infection, or the person just slips away, commonly after some 
days of reduced oral intake. Very severely frail people who 
die without a single apparent cause typically follow such a 
trajectory, commonly without much pain or even distress, 
often, with the exception of impaired bowel function. 
Level 9 – Terminally Ill is notable for being the only 
level in which the current state trumps the baseline state, in 
that the terminally ill person might have been operating at 
any frailty level at baseline. On the Clinical Frailty Scale 
card, this person is pictured seated in a chair. This reflects 
the fact that many older adults who are dying with a single 
system illness—notably cancer—have a reasonable level of 
function until about the very end. That is why we portray the 
situation in that way. Even so, if a terminally ill person was 
completely dependent for personal care at baseline, they would 
be scored as Level 8. 
Final Hints About Scoring and Next Steps
Within each level of the Clinical Frailty Scale, individual 
characteristics will vary. About 80% or more of people will 
fit the description offered for a given level. If they fit two 
categories equally well, in routine care it is best to score the 
scale at the higher or more dependent level. Sometimes we 
see people who are dependent in a single instrumental ADL 
that arises in a specific circumstance (e.g., relying on someone 
whom they trust to do banking duties due to the closure of a 
nearby bank branch or difficulty with the automated banking). 
In that case, the determination will often rest on the extent 
to which the person is aware of income and outflow; being 
aware of it and knowing that it remains a matter of import￾ance can suffice. We recognize that there is likely to be some 
variability in judgement in these circumstances, especially in 
the extent to which the rater or the person (or the informant) 
feel comfortable discussing such matters. This is inherent in 
a judgement-based measure and, in our view, a price worth 
paying compared with attempting to automate scoring that can 
specify all the variants its designers can imagine. 
Scoring the Clinical Frailty Scale in People with 
Cognitive Impairment
The degree of dementia generally corresponds to the degree 
of frailty. That is, mild dementia would go with mild frailty. 
In both cases, the person is independent in their personal or 
basic ADLs, but dependent in one or more instrumental ADLs. 
These accompany common symptoms of mild dementia: 
being able to recall a recent event but forgetting its details, 
repeating questions throughout the day, and no longer being 
able to use routines or cues to aid in either not losing items 
or finding them once lost. 
In moderate dementia, recent memory is very im￾paired, even though they seemingly can remember their past 
life events well. As with moderate frailty, they can do their

personal care with prompting or set-up. In severe dementia, 
as in severe frailty, people have progressive difficulty in 
performing personal ADLs and require increasing amounts 
of hands-on assistance. 
Using a Classification Tree to Improve the 
Reliability of Scoring
As of Spring 2020, we are beginning a multi-centre, multi￾country study using a classification tree to assist with grading 
the degree of frailty; clinical judgement is still required to score 
the Clinical Frailty Scale. Our goal is to improve the reliability 
of scoring the CFS using the classification tree. Inasmuch as 
the reliability will be measured in relation to the score given 
by an experienced rater, this is also a form of validity. We will 
further test validity by the ability to predict several outcomes 
in relation to COVID-19, including progression from mild to 
severe frailty, critical illness, mortality, and health care use. 
Summary
This is a brief account of key points in using the Clinical 
Frailty Scale. It can be read in conjunction with two con￾temporary papers in the Canadian Geriatrics Society CME 
Journal(16,17) and with a paper on the Pictorial Fit-Frail Scale.
(18) The latter can help to bridge between screening and assess￾ment measures, and can itself be summarized by the Clinical 
Frailty Scale. Additional resources include “Top Tips to help 
you use the Clinical Frailty Scale” developed by our group,(19)
a Clinical Frailty Scale App developed by the Acute Frailty 
Network in the UK(20) (this may be a useful alternative to 
the classification tree we are testing), a Clinical Frailty Scale 
Training Module developed by the AIMS Research Group at 
the Ottawa Hospital,(21) and a Clinical Frailty Scale Education 
Tool developed by the Non-Consultant Hospital Doctors of 
the Cork University Hospital.(22)
Our target audience is people who are new to the Clinical 
Frailty Scale and those who may be teaching about its use. 
We put this work in the context that it must be used carefully 
and combined with clinical judgement.(23) It should not be 
used in younger people in whom lifelong or single system 
disability does not have the same prognostic value as does that 
seen as a manifestation of wide-spread deficit accumulation. 
Even so, applied properly, the Clinical Frailty Scale seems 
likely to be much preferable to age when decisions must be 
made about allocating scarce resources.(17,24) An additional 
point to underscore is this: grading the degree of frailty in the 
context of COVID-19 is not the same as using it in ordinary 
care in geriatric medicine. In geriatric medicine, the goal of 
grading the degree of frailty is both to ease communication 
through a shared language, and also as the foundation for a 
care plan. The care plan needs to address the gap between 
the current level of function, cognition, mobility, and social 
relationships (especially with the primary carer) and how 
those have changed with the acute illness (when present). 
There the focus is on trying to restore the baseline state, or as 
close to that as might be achieved. This is a crucial distinction, 
and one that requires considerable skill to define, negotiate, 
evaluate, and adjust over the course of an inpatient stay. It 
should not be confused with the more instrumental purpose 
to which the Clinical Frailty Scale is now being put, which 
is no substitute for a patient-centred care plan. Even so, we 
hope that widespread use of the Clinical Frailty Scale can at 
least introduce new users to the manifold benefits that are 
possible with such an approach.
We have emphasized key general points: assay the base￾line state, do not use it with younger people or those with 
stable single-system disabilities, use judgement, and be pre￾pared to examine your judgement as experience grows. Sev￾eral specific points relating to each level of the scale are noted. 
Finally, we draw to attention that this is an inclusive scale. 
There is room on it for everyone—a reminder of the frailty 
that we all face, if we are lucky enough to live a long life.
