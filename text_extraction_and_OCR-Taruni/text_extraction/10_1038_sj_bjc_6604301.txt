Using a decision-analytic model, we evaluated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) in individuals with cirrhosis. Separate cohorts with cirrhosis due to alcoholic liver disease, hepatitis B and hepatitis C were
simulated. Results were also combined to approximate a mixed aetiology population. Comparisons were made between a variety of
surveillance algorithms using a-foetoprotein (AFP) assay and/or ultrasound at 6- and 12-monthly intervals. Parameter estimates were
obtained from comprehensive literature reviews. Uncertainty was explored using one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. In the
mixed aetiology cohort, 6-monthly AFP þ ultrasound was predicted to be the most effective strategy. The model estimates that,
compared with no surveillance, this strategy may triple the number of people with operable tumours at diagnosis and almost halve
the number of people who die from HCC. The cheapest strategy employed triage with annual AFP (incremental cost-effectiveness
ratio (ICER): d20 700 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained). At a willingness-to-pay threshold of d30 000 per QALY the most
cost-effective strategy used triage with 6-monthly AFP (ICER: d27 600 per QALY gained). The addition of ultrasound to this strategy
increased the ICER to d60 100 per QALY gained. Surveillance appears most cost-effective in individuals with hepatitis B-related
cirrhosis, potentially due to younger age at diagnosis of cirrhosis. Our results suggest that, in a UK NHS context, surveillance of
individuals with cirrhosis for HCC should be considered effective and cost-effective. The economic efficiency of different surveillance
strategies is predicted to vary markedly according to cirrhosis aetiology.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurs mainly in cases of
cirrhosis, which, in turn, tend to be secondary to either alcoholic
liver disease (ALD) or infection with hepatitis B or C viruses
(HBVs/HCVs). Symptomatic HCC typically presents late with a
bleak prognosis, whereas HCCs detected during formal surveil￾lance are smaller, more likely to be uninodular and more
commonly amenable to curative treatment (De Masi et al, 2005).
For this reason, UK (Ryder, 2003), European (Bruix et al, 2001)
and American (Bruix and Sherman, 2005) clinical guidelines
recommend routine surveillance for HCC among individuals with
cirrhosis, and approximately three-quarters of UK gastroenterolo￾gists undertake such a programme, mostly using a combination of
periodic serum a-foetoprotein (AFP) testing and ultrasound (US)
(Lai et al, 2002).
However, consensus has not been reached as to the optimal
surveillance strategy. We therefore developed a decision-analytic
model to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a range
of different surveillance strategies in the United Kingdom. We
considered populations with cirrhosis secondary to HBV or HCV
infection, and as a result of ALD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Overview of model
We developed a state-transition (Markov) model using TreeAge
Prot 2005 (TreeAge Software, Williamstown, MA, USA) to
compare alternative surveillance strategies. In this approach,
disease progression is modelled as movement between different
health states over time. Time is modelled as a series of fixed cycles,
in this case 1 month, with probabilities of movement between
states calculated per cycle. Costs and utility values are attached to
each state, and the differences between the aggregated costs and
health outcomes in each simulation are used to estimate the cost￾effectiveness of surveillance, expressed as incremental cost per
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) (Sonnenberg and Beck, 1993).
Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3.5% per year (HM Treasury,
2003). The perspective of the analysis is that of the UK NHS.

Simulated populations
The population of interest is people with compensated cirrhosis
aged 70 years or less with no pre-existing medical conditions that
might preclude treatment with liver transplantation (OLT) or
hepatic resection (including current alcohol or intravenous drug
use). The model considers three cirrhosis aetiologies (ALD, HBV
and HCV). Results were also combined to simulate a mixed
aetiology cohort, consisting of the following proportions (based on
an average of estimates provided by gastroenterologists in several
centres around the United Kingdom): 57.6% ALD, 7.3% HBV and
35.1% HCV.
Model structure
The structure of the model is shown in Figure 1. For the natural
history component of the model, we defined three classes of HCC:
small (o2 cm in diameter), medium (2 –5 cm) and large (45 cm).
Tumour characteristics in terms of detectability and treatability
are reflected in the transition probabilities. The following
simplifying assumptions were made: (i) progression from
cirrhosis to decompensated cirrhosis is irreversible; (ii) the rate
of incidence of HCC is the same in compensated and decom￾pensated livers; (iii) tumour diameter is used as a surrogate index
of all characteristics of tumour progression (multifocal tumours
are not modelled separately, since tumour nodularity is hetero￾geneous in the populations from which parameters have
been drawn; therefore, what our model defines as ‘medium’
tumours would, in real-world practice, include those with
multiple, small nodules that would not preclude transplantation,
and a ‘large’ tumour may be thought to include those which are
diffuse in nature); (iv) the presence of an HCC is only associated
with additional mortality risk when it becomes ‘large’ (at which
point it is also very likely to become symptomatic) and (v)
compensated cirrhosis is not subject to an excess mortality rate, as
the primary causes of death in these individuals are those already
accounted for in the model (i.e., progression to decompensation
and/or HCC).
The surveillance programme is superimposed onto the disease
process. We simulated six different surveillance regimes, consist￾ing of AFP-led, US-led and combined screening at 6- or 12-
monthly intervals (Figure 2). These were based on European
guidelines, which recommend that the diagnosis of HCC be based
on two coincident imaging techniques (Bruix et al, 2001). For
comparison, we also modelled an arm simulating no surveillance.
The possibility of incidental/symptomatic presentation of HCC is
modelled at all stages of disease. All confirmatory imaging is by CT
scan. We assumed 100% compliance with the surveillance
programme in the base-case analysis.
We modelled a mixed treatment approach using OLT and
resection. People can enter the OLT waiting list following diagnosis
of either a surgically treatable HCC or decompensated cirrhosis.
Each person is as likely to receive a liver as any other, regardless of
the reason for listing. While on the waiting list, people are subject
to the same natural history process as those prelisting, and no
‘bridging’ therapies are simulated. People who undergo successful
surgical treatment enter a simplified disease process in which
excess mortality rates and associated costs and utilities encompass
the spectrum of possible post-treatment experiences. There is no
waiting list for liver resection. Some people are deemed unsuitable
for either surgical treatment. A proportion of people with
surgically untreatable small and medium-sized tumours receive
palliative treatment with radiofrequency ablation and percuta￾neous ethanol injection. On progression to ‘terminal HCC large’,
an excess mortality with associated costs and utilities is applied
that reflects the palliation provided by transarterial chemoembo￾lisation for a proportion of people.

(full details and strategies available from the authors). We sought
data that fulfilled the following criteria: large, recent studies of
UK patients with a diagnosis of cirrhosis (with details of
aetiology). For parameters in which there were no UK-based
studies available, we sought data from countries with a similar
disease profile. Cost data were obtained from national (UK NHS;
Department of Health (DoH), 2005) sources where available,
supplemented by data from a recent UK-based observational study
of patients with HCV (Wright et al, 2006). Historical values were
inflated to 2004 prices.
Analysis of uncertainty
Extensive one-way sensitivity analyses were undertaken to
explore, which of the input parameters had the greatest impact
on results. For simplicity, these were performed using a single-core
comparison: 6-monthly AFP þ US vs no surveillance. Owing
to the paucity of reliable estimates for US sensitivity and the
possibility that these estimates do not accurately reflect
current practice, we examined the impact of simultaneously
varying the sensitivity of US for detecting tumours over a range
of correlated values from 5 to 50, 10 to 75 and 50 to 100% for small,
medium and large tumours, respectively. We also performed
scenario analyses testing less optimistic assumptions about patient
compliance.
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was also undertaken. Ten
thousand Monte Carlo simulations per aetiology were run, with
key input values randomly drawn from probabilistic density
functions in each iteration. Distributions can be obtained from the
authors.
RESULTS
Effectiveness of surveillance
Table 4 summarises the effectiveness of each surveillance strategy
in the mixed aetiology cohort. The 6-monthly AFP þ US was most
effective across all outcomes, more than tripling the number of
HCCs diagnosed while operable, and almost halving the number
dying from HCC, when compared with no surveillance. However,
the cheapest strategy, annual AFP-triage, still achieved substantial
gains: for example, more than doubling the number of operable
HCC found and increasing the number of small tumours found
more than six-fold.
Cost–utility of surveillance
Cost – utility results are shown in Table 5. In an incremental
analysis, neither of the US-only strategies would be considered
(since they are both slightly less effective and more costly than
surveillance at the same frequency with AFP-triage). Therefore, in
the mixed aetiology cohort the cheapest surveillance strategy is
annual AFP-triage, with incremental cost-utility of d20 700 per
QALY. Doubling the frequency of surveillance would increase the
mean number of QALYs by 0.035 at a cost of d1000 each, giving an
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of d27 000 per QALY
gained.
Deterministic sensitivity analyses
The cost – utility estimates appear to be most sensitive to changes
in tumour growth rate, mortality following OLT and excess

Because, in the algorithm simulated by the model, the use of CT is limited to a second line, confirmatory context, our base-case assumption

(Taouli et al, 2004; Baron and Brancatelli, 2004), we made the assumption that such fallibility should not be apparent in this context. The impact of this assumption was tested in

mortality associated with undiagnosed large tumours. Quality of
life in compensated cirrhosis and following OLT are also
important, as are costs associated with US and OLT. When the
cirrhosis aetiologies are considered separately, the mean age at
diagnosis in individuals with HBV-related cirrhosis becomes an
important variable.
Increases in US sensitivity lead to improved effectiveness in all
surveillance strategies. At both annual and 6-monthly frequencies,
US-led surveillance becomes more effective than AFP-triage surveil￾lance when it can be assumed that US is at least sensitive enough to
detect one in five small tumours, one in three medium tumours and
two in three large tumours. However, when costs are also considered,
it is only in the HBV cohort that US becomes more cost-effective than
AFP-triage surveillance at the same frequencies.
When we examined imperfect patient compliance with surveil￾lance, we found a noticeable reduction in effectiveness. However,
there was a commensurate reduction in costs, so incremental cost￾effectiveness results were not greatly altered.

case). The ICER for 6-monthly AFP þ US compared with no
surveillance ranges from d19 400 per QALY if no discounting is
applied to d35 800 per QALY if rates of 6% are used for both costs
and utilities.

monetary benefit) at different levels of willingness to pay for a
QALY.
At a willingness-to-pay threshold of d30 000 per QALY, the most
intensive surveillance protocol simulated (6-monthly AFP þ US) is
only likely to be considered cost-effective in individuals with HBV￾related cirrhosis. In those with HCV-related cirrhosis, 6-monthly
AFP-triage is more likely to be considered cost-effective; indeed,
willingness to pay would have to rise to around d65 000 per QALY
before 6-monthly AFP þ US becomes most likely to be considered
cost-effective in this population. In individuals with ALD-related
cirrhosis, there is uncertainty about which strategy would be most
cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of d30 000 per
QALY, with no surveillance, annual AFP-triage and 6-monthly
AFP-triage having approximately equal likelihood of maximal
cost-effectiveness.
In the mixed aetiology cohort, which approximates the decision
framework if a single strategy is to be adopted across all
aetiologies, surveillance of any kind can only be recommended if
willingness to pay approaches d30 000 per QALY. At this level, 6-
monthly AFP-triage appears to be the most cost-effective
surveillance protocol, and remains the foremost option until
willingness to pay reaches very high levels. This analysis suggests
that society would have to be prepared to spend nearly d70 000 per
QALY gained before the most effective strategy – 6-monthly
AFP þ US – could confidently be assumed to provide best value for
money.
DISCUSSION
Summary of main findings
Our analysis suggests that, in patients with cirrhosis, surveillance
strategies for HCC are effective, and can often be considered cost￾effective. The most effective strategy for a mixed aetiology cohort
of individuals with cirrhosis is AFP assay combined with US
imaging on a 6-monthly basis. However, when costs are taken into
account, using AFP as a triage step may be preferable. Surveillance
is much more likely to be cost-effective in those with HBV-related
cirrhosis, while surveillance of people with ALD-related cirrhosis
appears least economically efficient.
Interpretation of findings
According to our simulation, the economic efficiency of different
surveillance strategies can be expected to vary substantially
according to cirrhosis aetiology. As a result, the most efficient
mode of resource allocation, from a purely decision-analytic

viewpoint, would be to offer surveillance of differing intensity to
each subgroup. However, apart from the practical complications of
establishing different recall pathways for different patient groups,
concerns might also be raised about the ethical implications of this
approach. For instance, one-way sensitivity analysis suggested that
the particularly good value offered in the HBV group may be
substantially due to the younger age of the cohort. By implication,
then, there may be further subgroups of individuals with HCV and
ALD, diagnosed with cirrhosis at a younger age, in which more
intensive surveillance might be particularly cost-effective.
Our results also suggest that reports of the AFP test’s demise
(Sherman, 2001) may be exaggerated, particularly if one adopts a
cost-effectiveness perspective. We believe one reason for this is
that previous authors may have failed to account fully for tumour
size in their analyses. Although the AFP test has been found to be
relatively insensitive for detecting HCC in general (Trevisani et al,
2001), it has the substantial advantage that its sensitivity is only
weakly correlated with tumour size, meaning that it should be a
valuable aid to the detection of some of the smallest, most easily
treated tumours. According to the evidence used in our model,
65% of tumours less than 2 cm in diameter secrete 20 ng ml1 or
more of AFP (although this figure may be an overestimate, with the
true proportion around 46%; Farinati et al, 2006). In contrast, our
model is configured to simulate US sensitivity of only 10.7% for
the smallest category of tumour (Bennett et al, 2002). Although this
is at the pessimistic end of the range of available evidence, it
should not be seen as an outlying estimate. Every study that has
used an optimal reference standard (explant pathology) to
investigate the diagnostic capabilities of US, in this setting, has
reported disappointing sensitivity for the tumours p2 cm in
diameter: 13.8% (Kim et al, 2001), 22.2% (Rode et al, 2001) and
30.0% (Liu et al, 2003). Even if one was to adopt the most positive
estimate available, all robust evidence suggests that US is less
sensitive than AFP assay for the detection of the smallest tumours.
Additionally, AFP is a very cheap test and, inevitably, this is a
crucial consideration from a cost-effectiveness perspective. The
fact that current guidelines do not recommend using AFP
screening may reflect the poor quality of current evidence or a
lack of explicit attention to cost-effectiveness considerations
during the development of clinical guidelines. However, a strategy
led by one single diagnostic modality will always run the risk of
serial false-negative findings, and this setting provides a good
example (some tumours never secrete AFP and will therefore never
be detected using an AFP-led approach and, equally, some
tumours will infiltrate diffusely and resist US detection).
Because tumour growth rate had a clear influence on cost￾effectiveness in the one-way sensitivity analysis, we investigated
this factor further. We performed stratified scenario analyses,
simulating three mixtures of slow-growing and fast-growing
tumours, instead of applying one average growth rate throughout
the model. While the combination of growth rates had an impact
on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of surveillance (the
more fast-growing HCCs, the more cost-effective surveillance
becomes), the incremental relationship between surveillance
strategies was preserved. The only practical implication of these
additional findings is to suggest that, if the true mix of HCCs
features a preponderance of slow-growing tumours, it may not be
cost-effective to offer any surveillance strategy at 6-monthly
intervals.
Strengths of the evaluation
This is the first analysis of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness
of surveillance of cirrhosis for HCC in the UK NHS. Comprehen￾sive literature searches were conducted to inform the model
parameters, wherever possible choosing data either derived from
the UK population or most likely to be applicable to the UK
population.
Extensive exploration of model structures and uncertainty
suggest that our model more appropriately captures the disease
and surveillance process and impacts than previous studies in this
field. While we have assumed that decompensated cirrhosis is
irreversible, we showed in one-way sensitivity analysis that our
results are not greatly influenced by alterations in the annual rate
of progression from compensated to decompensated cirrhosis.
From this, it is safe to infer that allowing some regression from
decompensated back to compensated cirrhosis would not sig￾nificantly alter our main results. By accounting for the substantial
differences in age-related incidence, natural history and response
to treatment that exist according to cirrhosis aetiology, we
predict that different approaches to surveillance may be justified
according to different causes of cirrhosis.
Limitations of the evaluation
First, there is very little published evidence on which to base many
of the parameter estimates for the model, and few data originate
within the United Kingdom. This was particularly apparent for
defining US performance. Second, as the primary focus of this
evaluation was the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of surveil￾lance, we have used a simplified approach to modelling treatment
in which OLT and resection are the only curative options available.
We performed limited modelling of nonsurgical/ablative therapies
as the evidence at the time of the analysis was inconclusive
(Di Bisceglie, 2005). Recent evidence, predominantly from Asia
(Izumi et al, 2007; Peng et al, 2007; Zytoon et al, 2007), suggests
that such therapies may improve survival in patients with small
tumours. If similarly promising findings could be shown in the
United Kingdom, we would expect widespread adoption of such
techniques to have beneficial cost-effectiveness implications, since
a minimally invasive approach is much cheaper than OLT, and
might also be expected to have less negative impact on quality of
life. Third, we have assumed that entry to the surveillance
programme is confined to those more likely to be considered
eligible for the available curative treatment options (OLT or
resection) and therefore assumes that high-risk activity (excessive
alcohol consumption, intravenous drug use and so on) has ceased,
and this may not be realistic. We have also assumed that the three
cirrhosis aetiologies are mutually exclusive and acknowledge that
many people develop cirrhosis as a result of multiple causes.
Comparison with other studies
There are no other studies published studies from Europe. We
identified three comparable studies from our literature searches
(Arguedas et al, 2003; Lin et al, 2004; Patel et al, 2005); all were
conducted in the United States and simulated HCV-related
cirrhosis only. In these studies, 6-monthly surveillance using
AFP and US produced utility gains of between 0.23 and 0.49
QALYs, compared with no surveillance, giving ICERs of between
$24 500 and $46 600 per QALY gained. Apart from obvious
dissimilarities in input values and assumptions – reflecting the
different populations and health-care systems simulated – there
are substantial differences in the structures of the models.
Crucially, ours is the only model to have accounted for tumour
size in simulating the sensitivity of surveillance.
Implications for future research
Further research is required in the following areas (i) further
modelling studies using alternative modelling methods such as
individual patient sampling techniques could be used to account
for heterogeneity in the patient population, so that factors such as
tumour growth rate, tumour characteristics and the variability in
individual patients’ serial test results could be assessed. Such
methods could also be used to assess the optimal surveillance

strategy, the optimal surveillance interval and the effects of
surveillance on waiting lists for OLT; (ii) further modelling studies
could also investigate innovative surveillance strategies not
currently undertaken in clinical practice (e.g., alternating AFP
and US investigations at 6- or 12-monthly intervals, or measuring
change in AFP levels following serial tests rather than absolute
levels with fixed cutoff points); (iii) further empirical and
modelling analysis of the impact of age at diagnosis of cirrhosis
on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of surveillance; (iv)
empirical evaluation of newer imaging techniques (e.g., contrast￾enhanced US) to detect HCCs; and (v) assessment of the
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of surveillance in other
aetiologies (e.g., nonalcoholic fatty liver disease) and using other
curative treatment options (e.g., ablative techniques).
