Volume 65, Number 4	 June 30, 2016
Deaths: Final Data for 2014
by Kenneth D. Kochanek, M.A., Sherry L. Murphy, B.S., Jiaquan Xu, M.D., and
Betzaida Tejada-Vera, M.S., Division of Vital Statistics
Abstract
Objectives—This report presents final 2014 data on U.S.
deaths, death rates, life expectancy, infant mortality, and trends, by
selected characteristics such as age, sex, Hispanic origin, race,
state of residence, and cause of death.
Methods—Information reported on death certificates, which are
completed by funeral directors, attending physicians, medical exam￾iners, and coroners, is presented in descriptive tabulations. The
original records are filed in state registration offices. Statistical infor￾mation is compiled in a national database through the Vital Statistics
Cooperative Program of the National Center for Health Statistics.
Causes of death are processed in accordance with the International
Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision.
Results—In 2014, a total of 2,626,418 deaths were reported in
the United States. The age-adjusted death rate was 724.6 deaths per
100,000 U.S. standard population, a decrease of 1% from the 2013
rate and a record low figure. Life expectancy at birth was 78.8 years,
unchanged since 2012. Life expectancy increased for black males,
Hispanic males and females, and non-Hispanic black males, while it
decreased for non-Hispanic white females from 2013 to 2014. Age￾specific death rates decreased in 2014 from 2013 for age groups 1–4,
65–74, 75–84, and 85 and over. Age-specific death rates increased
for age groups 25–34, 35–44, and 55–64. The 15 leading causes of
death in 2014 remained the same as in 2013. The infant mortality rate
decreased 2.3% in 2014 from 2013 to a historically record low value
of 5.82 deaths per 1,000 live births.
Conclusions—The decline in the age-adjusted death rate to a
record low value for the United States is consistent with long-term
trends in mortality. Although life expectancy for the total population
remained unchanged since 2012, life expectancy for non-Hispanic
white females decreased from 2013 to 2014.

Trends
• The age-adjusted death rate declined to a record low in 2014.
• Life expectancy for the total population was 78.8 years in 2014,
unchanged since 2012.
• Life expectancy for females was 4.8 years higher than for males.
The difference in life expectancy between the sexes has nar￾rowed since 1979, when it was 7.8 years, but it has remained at
4.8 years since 2010.
• In 2014 from 2013, life expectancy increased for black males (0.2
years), Hispanic males (0.1), Hispanic females (0.2), and non￾Hispanic black males (0.2), while decreasing for non-Hispanic
white females (–0.1).
• The 15 leading causes of death were the same in 2014 as they
were in 2013.
• Age-adjusted death rates decreased significantly in 2014 from
2013 for 6 of the 15 leading causes of death and increased for
5 of the 15 leading causes.
• Rates for the two leading causes—heart disease and cancer—
continued their long-term decreasing trends. Significant
decreases also occurred for Chronic lower respiratory disease,
diabetes, Influenza and pneumonia, and hypertension. Significant
increases occurred in 2014 from 2013 for unintentional injuries,
stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, suicide, and Chronic liver disease
and cirrhosis.
• Within external causes of injury death, unintentional poisoning
was the leading mechanism of injury mortality in 2014, followed
by unintentional motor vehicle traffic-related injuries. During
2002–2010, unintentional motor vehicle traffic-related injuries
was the leading mechanism of injury mortality, followed by unin￾tentional poisoning, but beginning in 2011, the number of deaths
from unintentional poisoning was higher than the number from
unintentionalmotor vehicle traffic-related injuries; see the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Web-based Injury
Statistics Query and Reporting System (WISQARS) at
http://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/index.html.
• Differences in mortality between the non-Hispanic black and
non-Hispanic white populations persisted. The age-adjusted
death rate was 1.2 times greater for the non-Hispanic black
population than for the non-Hispanic white population.
• The difference in life expectancy between the non-Hispanic black
and non-Hispanic white populations narrowed by 0.2 years from
3.8 years in 2013 to 3.6 years in 2014. The difference in life
expectancy between the Hispanic and non-Hispanic white popu￾lations increased by 0.3 years from 2.7 years in 2013 to 3.0 years
in 2014.
• The infant mortality rate decreased 2.3% in 2014 from 2013, to
a record low of 5.82 infant deaths per 1,000 live births.
Introduction
This report presents detailed 2014 data on deaths and death
rates according to a number of demographic and medical character￾istics. These data provide information on mortality patterns among
residents of the United States by such variables as age, sex,
Hispanic origin, race, state of residence, and cause of death.
Information on these mortality patterns is key to understanding
changes in the health and well-being of the U.S. population (1).
Companion reports present additional details on leading causes of
death and life expectancy in the United States (2,3).
Mortality data in this report can be used to monitor and evaluate
the health status of the United States in terms of currentmortality levels
and long-term mortality trends, as well as to identify segments of the
U.S. population at greater risk of death from specific diseases and
injuries. Differences in death rates among various demographic sub￾populations, including race and ethnicity groups, may reflect sub￾population differences in factors such as socioeconomic status, access
to medical care, and the prevalence of specific risk factors in a
particular subpopulation.
Methods
Data in this report are based on information from all resident
death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia.
More than 99% of deaths occurring in this country are believed to be
registered (4). Tables showing data by state also provide information
for Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of
the Northern Mariana Islands (Northern Marianas). Cause-of-death
statistics presented in this report are classified in accordance with
the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD–10)
(5–7). A discussion of the cause-of-death classification is provided in
the Technical Notes at the end of the report.
Mortality data on specific demographic and medical character￾istics cover all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Measures of
mortality in this report include the number of deaths; crude, age￾specific, and age-adjusted death rates; infant, neonatal, and post￾neonatal mortality rates; life expectancy; and rate ratios. Changes in
death rates in 2014 compared with 2013, and differences in death rates
across demographic groups in 2014, are tested for statistical signifi￾cance. Unless otherwise specified, reported differences are statisti￾cally significant. Additional information on these statistical methods,
random variation and relative standard error, the computation of
derived statistics and rates, population denominators, and the defi￾nition of terms is presented in the Technical Notes.
The populations used to calculate death rates shown in this report
for 1991–2014 were produced under a collaborative arrangement with
the U.S. Census Bureau. Populations for 2010–2014 and the inter￾censal period 2001–2009 are consistent with the 2010 census (8–13).
Reflecting the latest guidelines issued in 1997 by the Office of Man￾agement and Budget (OMB), the 2000 and 2010 censuses included
an option for persons to report more than one race as appropriate for
themselves and household members (14); see Technical Notes for
detailed information on the 2014 multiple-race reporting area and
methods used to bridge responses for those who report more than one
race. Beginning with deaths occurring in 2003, some states allowed
for multiple-race reporting on the death certificate. Multiple-race data
for these states are bridged to single-race categories; see Technical
Notes. Once all states are collecting data on race according to the

1997 OMB guidelines, use of the bridged-race process is expected to
be discontinued.
The population data used to compile death rates by race in this
report are based on special estimation procedures and are not true
counts (see Technical Notes, ‘‘Race and Hispanic origin’’). This is the
case even for the 2000 and 2010 populations. The estimation pro￾cedures used to develop these populations contain some error.
Smaller population groups are affected much more than larger popu￾lation groups (15). Data presented in this report and other mortality
tabulations are available from the National Center for Health Statistics
(NCHS) website: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/deaths.htm. Availability of
mortality microdata is described in the Technical Notes.
Results and Discussion
Deaths and death rates
In 2014, a total of 2,626,418 resident deaths were registered in
the United States—29,425 more deaths than in 2013. The crude
death rate for 2014 (823.7 deaths per 100,000 population) was 0.3%
higher than the 2013 rate (821.5) (Tables A, 1, 3, 4, 14, and 15).
The age-adjusted death rate in 2014 was 724.6 deaths per
100,000 U.S. standard population—a record low value that was 1.0%
lower than the 2013 rate of 731.9 (Tables A and 1). Age-adjusted death
rates are constructs that show what the level of mortality would be if
no changes occurred in the age composition of the population from
year to year. (For a discussion of age-adjusted death rates, see
Technical Notes.) Thus, age-adjusted death rates are better indicators
than unadjusted (crude) death rates for examining changes in the risk
of death over a period of time when the age distribution of the
population is changing. Age-adjusted death rates also are better
indicators of relative risk when comparing mortality across geographic
areas or between sex or race subgroups of the population that have
different age distributions; see Technical Notes. Since 1980, the
age-adjusted death rate has decreased significantly every year except
1983, 1985, 1988, 1993, 1999, 2005, 2008, and 2013 (Figure 1 and
Table 1).
Race—In 2014, age-adjusted death rates for the major race
groups (Table 1) were:
•	 White population: 725.4 deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard popu￾lation
•	 Black population: 849.3
In 2014, the age-adjusted death rate for the black population
was 1.2 times that for the white population (Table B). The average
risk of death for the black population was 17.1% higher than for the
white population (Table 1). From 1960 through 1982, rates for the
black and white populations declined by similar percentages (22.6%
and 26.5%, respectively). From 1983 through 1988, rates diverged,
increasing 3.5% for the black population and decreasing 2.0% for
the white population. The disparity in age-adjusted death rates
between the black and white populations was greatest from 1988
through 1996 (1.4 times greater for the black population). Since
1996, the disparity between the two populations has narrowed, as
the age-adjusted rate for the black population declined 27.9% while
the rate for the white population declined 16.5% (Table 1 and
Figure 2).

Figure 1. Crude and age-adjusted death rates: United States, 1960–2014
In 2014, age-adjusted death rates decreased for white males
(0.7%), white females (1.0%), black males (1.8%), and black females
(1.0%) (Tables A and 1).
In general, age-adjusted death rates declined from 1980 through
2014 for white males and females and for black males and females.
The rate decreased an average of 1.3% per year for white males, 0.7%
for white females, 1.4% for black males, and 1.1% for black females
during 1980–2014 (Table 1).
Rates for the American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN) and Asian
or Pacific Islander (API) populations should be interpreted with caution
because of reporting problems regarding correct identification of race
on both the death certificate and in population censuses and surveys
(16).
Counts of deaths for the AIAN population are substantially under￾reported (by about 30%) on the death certificate relative to self￾reporting while alive (16). Thus, the age-adjusted death rates that are
shown for the AIAN population (e.g., Tables 1 and 16) do not lend
themselves to valid comparisons against other races.
Year-to-year trends for the AIAN population present valid insight
into changes in mortality affecting this group, if it is reasonable to
assume that the level of underreporting of AIAN deaths has remained
more or less constant over past years (16). The age-adjusted death
rate for the AIAN population fluctuated from 1980 through 1999,
peaking in 1993 at 796.4 deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population
(Table 1). Since 1999, the rate has trended downward, declining 23.9%
from 1999 to 2014. The rate for the AIAN population increased 0.4%
from 2013 (591.7) to 2014 (594.1), although the change was not
significant (Table A).
In 2014, the age-adjusted death rate for the API population was
388.3 deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population. The level of
underreporting of deaths for the API population (about 7%) is not as
high as for the AIAN population (16), but this underreporting still
creates enough of a challenge that any comparisons of this population
with other races must be interpreted with caution. The age-adjusted
death rate for the API population peaked at 586.5 in 1985. The rate
fluctuated from 1985 through 1993 before starting a persistent down￾ward trend, decreasing 31.4% from 1993 to 2014 (Table 1).
Hispanic origin—Problems of race and Hispanic-origin reporting
affect Hispanic death rates and the comparison of rates for the
Hispanic and non-Hispanic populations; see Technical Notes. Mortality
for Hispanic persons is somewhat understated because of net under￾reporting of Hispanic origin on the death certificate (by an estimated
5%), while the non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black populations
are not affected by problems of underreporting (16,17); see Technical
Notes. Underreporting of Hispanic origin on the death certificate is
relatively stable across age groups (16).

Multiple-race data were reported by 46 states and the District of Columbia in 2014. The multiple-race data for these reporting areas were bridged to the single-race categories of the 1977 OMB 
standards for comparability with other reporting areas; see Technical Notes. 
The age-adjusted death rate in 2014 was 523.3 for the Hispanic 
population (a decrease of 2.3% from the rate in 2013), 742.8 for the 
non-Hispanic white population (a decrease of 0.6%), and 870.7 for the 
non-Hispanic black population (a decrease of 1.6%) (Tables C, 2, and 
17). 
The age-adjusted death rate decreased in 2014 from 2013 for 
Hispanic males (2.0%), Hispanic females (2.5%), non-Hispanic white 
males (0.5%), non-Hispanic white females (0.7%), non-Hispanic black 
males (2.1%), and non-Hispanic black females (1.3%) (Tables C and 
2). 
Within the Hispanic population, the age-adjusted death rate for 
males was 1.4 times the rate for females in 2014 (Table 2). The 
male-to-female death rate ratio for the Hispanic population was 
unchanged from the ratio in 2013. The corresponding male-to-female 
ratio was 1.4 for the non-Hispanic white population and 1.5 for the 
non-Hispanic black population in 2014. The male-to-female ratios for 
non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black populations were also 
unchanged from 2013. Age-adjusted death rates in 2014 for selected 
Hispanic subgroups (Table 5), in order of relative magnitude, were: 
• Puerto Rican population: 633.2 deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard 
population 
• Mexican population: 547.8 
• Cuban population: 525.2 
• Central and South American population: 346.8 
Death rates by age and sex
Age-specific death rates decreased significantly from 2013 to 
2014 for age groups 1–4, 65–74, 75–84, and 85 and over. 
Age-specific death rates increased for age groups 25–34, 35–44 and 
55–64. Changes in rates for the other age groups were not 
significant (Tables A, 9, and 11; Figure 3). 
The death rate for males declined significantly for age groups 1–4, 
75–84, and 85 and over. Significant increases in rates for males were 
for age groups 25–34, 35–44, and 55–64. Changes in the rates for 
males in other age groups were not significant. The death rates for 
females declined significantly for age groups 5–14, 65–74, 75–84, and 
85 and over, while increasing for age groups 35–44 and 55–64. 
Race—In 2014, age-specific death rates declined significantly for 
white males in age groups 1–4, 75–84, and 85 and over, and increased 
for age groups 25–34, 35–44, and 55–64 (Table A). For the black male 
population in 2014, death rates decreased for age groups 75–84 and 
85 and over. For API males, rates decreased for age groups 75–84 
and 85 and over. For AIAN males, rates did not change significantly 
for any age group. Other observed changes for males by race were 
not statistically significant. 
For white females, age-specific death rates decreased signifi￾cantly in 2014 for those aged 65–74, 75–84, and 85 and over, and 
increased significantly for those aged 25–34, 35–44, and 55–64. For 
black females in 2014, the only statistically significant change was a

for age groups 1–4, 5–14, 75–84, and 85 and over. The only significant
change in rates for AIAN females was an increase for those under 1
year. Other observed changes for females by race were not statistically
significant.
Hispanic origin—For the total Hispanic population in 2014 com￾pared with 2013, age-specific death rates decreased significantly for
age groups 1–4, 65–74, 75–84, and 85 and over (Table C). Rates for
Hispanic males decreased for age groups 1–4, 65–74, 75–84, and 85
and over, and increased for ages 35–44. For Hispanic females, rates
decreased for age groups 75–84 and 85 and over. Other observed
changes were not statistically significant.
Non-Hispanic origin—For the total non-Hispanic white population
in 2014 compared with 2013, age-specific death rates decreased
significantly for age groups 65–74, 75–84, and 85 and over, and
increased for those aged 25–34, 35–44, and 55–64. Rates for non￾Hispanic white males decreased for age groups under 1 year, 75–84,
and 85 and over, and increased for those aged 25–34, 35–44, and
55–64. For non-Hispanic white females, rates decreased for age
groups 65–74, 75–84, and 85 and over, and increased for those aged
25–34, 35–44, 45–54, and 55–64.
For the total non-Hispanic black population in 2014 compared
with 2013, age-specific death rates decreased significantly for age
groups 25–34, 65–74, 75–84, and 85 and over. Rates for non-Hispanic
black males decreased for age groups 75–84 and 85 and over. For
non-Hispanic black females, rates decreased for age groups 65–74,
75–84, and 85 and over. Other observed changes were not statistically
significant.
Expectation of life at birth and at specified
ages
Life expectancy at birth represents the average number of
years that a group of infants would live if the group was to
experience throughout life the age-specific death rates present in the
year of birth.
Life table data shown in this report for data years 2001–2014 are
based on a revisedmethodology first presented with final data reported
for 2008. The life table methodology was revised by changing the
smoothing technique used to estimate the life table functions at the
oldest ages. This revision improves on the methodologies used pre￾viously; see Technical Notes.
The methods used to produce life expectancies by Hispanic origin
are based on death rates adjusted for misclassification (see Technical
Notes). In contrast, the age-specific and age-adjusted death rates
shown in this report for the Hispanic population are not adjusted for
misclassification of Hispanic origin. Thus, the report shows Hispanic
deaths and death rates as collected by the registration areas; these
match those produced using the mortality data file.

Race categories are consistent with the 1977 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) standards. Multiple-race data were reported by 46 states and the District of Columbia in 2014 and by 42
 
states and the District of Columbia in 2013; see Technical Notes. The multiple-race data for these reporting areas were bridged to the single-race categories of the 1977 OMB standards for
 
comparability with other reporting areas; see Technical Notes.

Death rates for ‘‘Under 1 year’’ (based on population estimates) differ from infant mortality rates (based on live births).
 
Life tables were generated for both sexes and by each sex for
the following populations:
•	 Total U.S. population
•	 Black population
•	 White population
•	 Hispanic population
•	 Non-Hispanic white population
•	 Non-Hispanic black population
In 2014, life expectancy at birth for the U.S. population was
78.8 years, unchanged since 2012 (Tables 6–8). The trend in U.S.
life expectancy since 1900 has been one of gradual improvement,
with occasional single-year decreases. In 2014, life expectancy was
the same as in 2013 for females (81.2 years) and males (76.4
years). From 1900 through the late 1970s, the gap in life expectancy
between the sexes widened (Figure 4) (3), from 2.0 to 7.8 years
(data prior to 1975 are not shown). Since its peak in the 1970s, the
gap between sexes has been narrowing. In 2014, the difference in
life expectancy between the sexes was 4.8 years, unchanged since
2010.
Life expectancy increased 0.1 years for the black population in
2014 to 75.6 years compared with 2013 (75.5). Life expectancy for the
white population decreased 0.1 years to 79.0 years. The difference in
life expectancy between the white and black populations in 2014 was
3.4 years (Table 8). The white-black gap has been narrowing gradually,
from a peak of 7.1 years in 1993 to the current record low (Figure 4).
This continues a long-term decline in the white-black difference in life
expectancy that was interrupted from 1983 through 1993 when the gap
widened.
Life expectancy for white males has increased or remained the
same nearly every year since 1975 (Figure 5). In contrast, life expec￾tancy for black males declined every year from 1985 through 1989,
then resumed the long-term trend of increase for most years from 1990
through 2014 (Table 8). For white females, life expectancy increased
in most years from 1975 through 1998. In 1999, life expectancy for
white females briefly fell slightly below 1998’s then-record high but
began to increase again in 2001. From 1989 through 1992, during
1994, and from 1996 through 1998, life expectancy for black females
increased. In 1999, life expectancy for black females declined, as it
did for white females, only to begin climbing again in 2000. Life
expectancy for white and black females has remained unchanged
since 2012.
Life expectancy for the Hispanic population was 81.8 years in
2014, an increase of 0.2 years compared with 2013 (Tables 7 and 8).
Life expectancy figures for the Hispanic population have been avail￾able starting with data for 2006 (18). Since that year, life expectancy
for the Hispanic population has increased by 1.5 years. In 2014, life
expectancy for the Hispanic female population was 84.0 years, a
0.2-year increase from 2013. Life expectancy for the Hispanic male
population in 2014 was 79.2 years, a 0.1-year increase from 2013. The
difference in life expectancy between the sexes for the Hispanic
population was 4.8 years, a 0.1-year increase from the 2013 gap.

Figure 3. Death rates, by age and sex: United States, 1955–2014
Life expectancy for the non-Hispanic white population was 78.8
years in 2014, a decrease of 0.1 years compared with 2013 (Tables 7
and 8). For non-Hispanic white males, life expectancy did not change
(76.5 years), while for non-Hispanic white females, life expectancy
decreased 0.1 years to 81.1 years.
Life expectancy for the non-Hispanic black population was 75.2
years in 2014, an increase of 0.1 years compared with 2013 (Tables 7
and 8). For non-Hispanic black males, life expectancy increased 0.2
years to 72.0, while life expectancy for non-Hispanic black females
remained unchanged since 2012 (78.1 years).
Among the six Hispanic origin-race-sex groups (Tables 7 and 8)
in 2014, Hispanic females had the highest life expectancy at birth (84.0
years), followed by non-Hispanic white females (81.1), Hispanic males
(79.2), non-Hispanic black females (78.1), non-Hispanic white males
(76.5), and non-Hispanic black males (72.0).
Life expectancy data by race include persons of Hispanic and
non-Hispanic origin; life expectancy data by Hispanic origin include
persons of any race. Life expectancy is higher when the Hispanic
population is included in the race group. For example, life expectancy
was 75.6 years for the black population, but was 75.2 for the non￾Hispanic black population. Similarly, life expectancy for the white
population was 79.0, but was 78.8 for the non-Hispanic white
population.
Life expectancy for both males and females was more than 2
years higher for the Hispanic population than for the non-Hispanic
white and non-Hispanic black populations. Various hypotheses have
been proposed to explain favorable mortality outcomes among His￾panic persons. The most prevalent hypotheses are the healthy migrant
effect, which argues that Hispanic immigrants are selected for their
good health and robustness; the ‘‘salmon bias’’ effect, which posits that
U.S. residents of Hispanic origin may return to their country of origin
to die or when ill; and the ‘‘cultural effects,’’ which argues that culturally
influenced family structure, lifestyle behaviors, and social networks
may confer a protective barrier against the negative effects of low
socioeconomic and minority status (19,20).
Life tables shown in this report may be used to compare life
expectancies at selected ages from birth to 100 years. For example,
on the basis of mortality experienced in 2014, a person aged 50 could

Figure 4. Differences in female-male and white-black life expectancy: United States, 1975–2014
expect to live an average of 31.6 more years, for a total of 81.6 years.
A person aged 65 could expect to live an average of 19.3 more years,
for a total of 84.3, and a person aged 85 could expect to live an average
of 6.6 more years, for a total of 91.6 (Tables 6 and 7).
Leading causes of death
The 15 leading causes of death in 2014 accounted for 79.6% of
all deaths in the United States (Tables B and 9). The leading causes
of death in 2014 remained the same as in 2013. Causes of death
are ranked according to the number of deaths; for ranking proce￾dures, see Technical Notes. By rank, the 15 leading causes of death
in 2014 were:
1.	 Diseases of heart (heart disease)
2.	 Malignant neoplasms (cancer)
3.	 Chronic lower respiratory diseases
4.	 Accidents (unintentional injuries)
5.	 Cerebrovascular diseases (stroke)
6.	 Alzheimer’s disease
7.	 Diabetes mellitus (diabetes)
8.	 Influenza and pneumonia
9.	 Nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis (kidney
disease)
10.	 Intentional self-harm (suicide)
11.	 Septicemia
12.	 Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis
13.	 Essential hypertension and hypertensive renal dis￾ease (hypertension)
14.	 Parkinson’s disease
15.	 Pneumonitis due to solids and liquids
The pattern of mortality varies greatly with age. As a result, the
shifting age distribution of a population can significantly influence
changes in crude death rates over time. Age-adjusted death rates, in
contrast, eliminate the influence of such differences in the population
age structure. Therefore, whereas causes of death are ranked
according to the number of deaths, age-adjusted death rates are
used to depict trends for leading causes of death in this report
because they are better than crude rates for showing changes in
mortality over time and among causes of death (Figure 6).
From 2013 to 2014, the age-adjusted death rate declined sig￾nificantly for 6 of the 15 leading causes of death and increased for 5
leading causes. The age-adjusted death rate for the leading cause of

Figure 5. Life expectancy, by race and sex: United States, 1970–2014
death, heart disease, decreased 1.6%. The age-adjusted death rate
for cancer decreased 1.2% (Tables B and 9). Deaths from these two
diseases combined accounted for 45.9% of deaths in the United States
in 2014. Except for a relatively small increase in 1993, mortality from
heart disease has declined steadily since 1980 (Figure 6). The age￾adjusted death rate for cancer, the second leading cause of death, has
shown a gradual but consistent downward trend since 1993 (Figure 6).
Other leading causes of death that showed significant decreases
in 2014 relative to 2013 were Chronic lower respiratory diseases
(3.8%), diabetes (1.4%), Influenza and pneumonia (5.0%), and hyper￾tension (3.5%).
The age-adjusted death rate increased significantly between
2013 and 2014 for five leading causes: unintentional injuries (2.8%),
stroke (0.8%), Alzheimer’s disease (8.1%), suicide (3.2%), and
Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis (2.0%).
Observed changes from 2013 to 2014 in the age-adjusted death
rate for Parkinson’s disease and Pneumonitis due to solids and liquids
were not significant. Age-adjusted rates were unchanged in 2014 from
2013 for Septicemia and kidney disease.
Assault (homicide), the 17th leading cause of death in 2014,
dropped from among the 15 leading causes of death in 2010 but is
still a major issue for some age groups. In 2014, homicide remained
among the 15 leading causes of death for age groups 1–4 (3rd), 5–14
(5th), 15–24 (3rd), 25–34 (3rd), 35–44 (5th), and 45–54 (13th).
Although Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease has not
been among the 15 leading causes of death since 1997 (21), it is still
considered a major public health problem for some age groups.
Historically, for all ages combined, HIV disease mortality reached its
highest level in 1995 after a period of increase from 1987 through
1994. Subsequently, the rate for this disease decreased an average
of 33.0% per year from 1995 through 1998, and 6.3% per year from
1999 through 2014 (22). In 2014, HIV disease remained among the
15 leading causes of death for age groups 15–24 (13th), 25–34 (8th),
35–44 (9th), 45–54 (11th), and 55–64 (14th).Among these age groups,
the ranking of HIV disease changed between 2013 and 2014 only for
those aged 45–54, dropping from 10th leading cause in 2013 to 11th
leading cause in 2014 (23).
Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile (C. difficile)—a predomi￾nantly antibiotic-associated inflammation of the intestines caused by
C. difficile, a gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-forming bacillus—is of
growing concern. The disease is often acquired in hospitals or other
health care facilities with long-term patients or residents (24,25). The
number of deaths from C. difficile climbed from 793 deaths in 1999
to a high of 8,085 deaths in 2011 (22,23). In 2014, the number of

Figure 6. Age-adjusted death rates for selected leading causes of death: United States, 1958–2014
deaths from C. difficile was 7,130, continuing to decline after a slight
increase in 2011. In 2014, the age-adjusted death rate for this cause
was 1.9 deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population, a decrease of
9.5% from the rate in 2013 (2.1). In 2014, C. difficile ranked as the
18th leading cause of death for the population aged 65 and over.
Nearly 90% of deaths from C. difficile occurred among people aged
65 and over (Table 10).
Changes in mortality levels by age and cause of death can have
a major effect on changes in life expectancy. While changes in causes
of death occurred in 2014 from 2013, life expectancy at birth for the
total population did not change. Decreases in mortality from cancer,
Chronic lower respiratory diseases, and heart disease were offset by
increases in mortality from unintentional injuries, Alzheimer’s disease,
and suicide. (In other words, if mortality for these causes of death had
not increased as much as it did in 2014, the life expectancy for the
total population might have increased.) Life expectancy at birth for both
males and females did not change between 2013 and 2014. Formales,
decreases in mortality from cancer, heart disease, and Chronic lower
respiratory diseases were offset by increases in mortality from unin￾tentional injuries, Alzheimer’s disease, and suicide. Similarly for the
female population, decreases in mortality from Chronic lower respi￾ratory diseases, cancer, and heart disease were offset by increases
in mortality from Alzheimer’s disease, unintentional injuries, and
stroke. (For a discussion of the major causes contributing to the
change in life expectancy, see Technical Notes.)
The relative risk of death in one population group compared with
another can be expressed as a ratio. Ratios based on age-adjusted
death rates show that males have higher rates than females for 13
of the 15 leading causes of death (Table B), with rates for males being
at least twice as great as those for females for 4 of these leading
causes. The largest ratio was for suicide (3.6). Other large ratios were
evident for Parkinson’s disease (2.3), unintentional injuries and
Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis (2.0 each), Pneumonitis due to
solids and liquids (1.9), heart disease (1.6), diabetes and kidney
disease (1.5 each), cancer (1.4), Influenza and pneumonia (1.3),
Chronic lower respiratory diseases and Septicemia (1.2 each), and
hypertension (1.1). Age-adjusted rates were lower for males than for
females for one leading cause, Alzheimer’s disease (0.7).
Age-adjusted death rates for the black population were higher
than for the white population for 8 of the 15 leading causes of death
(Table B). The largest ratio was for hypertension (2.1). Other causes
for which the ratio was high include kidney disease (2.0), diabetes
(1.9), Septicemia (1.8), stroke (1.4), heart disease (1.2), and cancer
and Influenza and pneumonia (1.1 each). For 6 of the leading causes,

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12 National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 65 No. 4, June 30, 2016
age-adjusted rates were lower for the black population than for the
white population. The smallest black-to-white ratio was for suicide
(0.4); that is, the risk of dying from suicide was more than double for
the white population than for the black population. Other conditions
with a low black-to-white ratio were Parkinson’s disease (0.5), Chronic
liver disease and cirrhosis (0.6), Chronic lower respiratory diseases
(0.7), and unintentional injuries and Alzheimer’s disease (0.8 each).
Life expectancy for the white population in 2014 decreased 0.1
years to 79.0 years. This decrease was due to increases in mortality
from unintentional injuries, Alzheimer’s disease, suicide, Chronic liver
disease and cirrhosis, and stroke. These increases in mortality were
offset by decreases for cancer, Chronic lower respiratory diseases,
and heart disease.
Life expectancy for the black population in 2014 increased 0.1
years to 75.6 years. This increase was due to decreases in mortality
from cancer, heart disease, Septicemia, Chronic lower respiratory
diseases, and diabetes. These decreases in mortality were offset by
increases for Congenital malformations, deformations and chromo￾somal abnormalities, Alzheimer’s disease, homicide, and Influenza
and pneumonia leading to an increase in life expectancy of only 0.1
years.
The difference in life expectancy between the white and black
populations narrowed from 3.6 years in 2013 to 3.4 years in 2014
(Table 8). The narrowing in the black-white life expectancy gap was
due primarily to greater improvements in mortality for the black popu￾lation than for the white population. For example, the black population
experienced greater improvements in mortality from suicide, uninten￾tional injuries, Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, and Chronic lower
respiratory diseases (data not shown).
Death rates for the AIAN population are not adjusted for mis￾classification. Given that the rates for the AIAN population are under￾estimated by about 30% (16), disparities in the age-adjusted death
rates should be interpreted with caution when making comparisons
across races. For the API population, death rates are not adjusted for
misclassification and are underestimated by about 7% due to under￾reporting on death certificates (16). Therefore, even though the level
of underestimation for this population is not as great as for the AIAN
population, similar caution should be exercised when interpreting rate
disparities involving the API population and other races.
Death rates for the population of Hispanic origin are not adjusted
for misclassification (see Technical Notes). Because these rates are
both unadjusted for misclassification and underestimated by about
5.0% (16), caution should be exercised when interpreting rate dis￾parities in the Hispanic and non-Hispanic populations.
Life table partitioning analysis indicates that the difference of 3.0
years in life expectancy between the Hispanic and non-Hispanic white
populations is mostly explained by greater improvements in mortality
from cancer, heart disease, Chronic lower respiratory diseases, unin￾tentional injuries, and suicide experienced by the Hispanic population.
(For a discussion of the major causes contributing to the difference
in life expectancy, see Technical Notes.)
Leading causes of death in 2014 for the total population and for
specific subpopulations are examined in more detail in ‘‘Deaths:
Leading Causes for 2014’’ (2).
Injury mortality by mechanism and intent
In 2014, a total of 199,756 deaths were classified as injury￾related (Table 18). Injury data are presented using the external
cause-of-injury mortality matrix for ICD–10, as jointly conceived by
the International Collaborative Effort (ICE) on Injury Statistics and
the Injury Control and Emergency Health Services section, known as
ICEHS, of the American Public Health Association (26,27). The ICD
codes for injuries have two essential dimensions: the mechanism of
the injury and its manner or intent. The mechanism involves the
circumstances of the injury (e.g., fall, motor vehicle traffic, or
poisoning). The manner or intent involves whether the injury was
purposefully inflicted (where it can be determined) and, when
intentional, whether the injury was self-inflicted (suicide) or inflicted
upon another person (assault). In the ‘‘List of 113 Selected Causes
of Death,’’ the focus is on manner or intent, with subcategories
showing selected mechanisms. The matrix has two distinct advan￾tages for the analysis of injury mortality data: It contains a
comprehensive list of mechanisms, and data can be displayed by
mechanism with subcategories of intent, or vice versa. Four major
mechanisms of injury in 2014—poisoning, motor-vehicle traffic,
firearm, and fall—accounted for 76.3% of all injury deaths.
Poisoning—In 2014, 51,966 deaths occurred as the result of
poisonings, 26.0% of all injury deaths (Table 18). The age-adjusted
death rate for poisoning increased significantly, 6.6%, from15.2 deaths
per 100,000 U.S. standard population in 2013 to 16.2 in 2014. The
majority of poisoning deaths were either unintentional (80.9%) or
suicides (13.1%). However, 5.8% of poisoning deaths were of unde￾termined intent. The age-adjusted death rate for unintentional poi￾soning increased 7.4%, from 12.2 in 2013 to 13.1 in 2014, and has
nearly tripled since 1999 (data prior to 2014 are not shown but are
available through CDC WONDER at http://wonder.cdc.gov/).
Motor-vehicle traffic—In 2014, motor-vehicle traffic-related inju￾ries resulted in 33,736 deaths, accounting for 16.9% of all injury deaths
(Table 18). The age-adjusted death rate for these injuries decreased
significantly, 1.9%, from 10.5 in 2013 to 10.3 in 2014.
Firearm—In 2014, 33,594 persons died from firearm injuries in
the United States (Tables 18 and 19), accounting for 16.8% of all injury
deaths in that year. The age-adjusted death rate from firearm injuries
(all intents) did not change significantly in 2014 from 2013. The two
major component causes of firearm injury deaths in 2014 were suicide
(63.7%) and homicide (32.8%). The age-adjusted death rate for
firearm homicide decreased 2.8%, from 3.6 in 2013 to 3.5 in 2014. The
rate for firearm suicide did not change.
Fall—In 2014, 33,018 persons died as the result of falls, 16.5%
of all injury deaths (Table 18). The age-adjusted death rate for falls
increased 3.4%, from 8.8 in 2013 to 9.1 in 2014. The overwhelming
majority of fall-related deaths (96.8%) were unintentional.
Drug-induced mortality
In 2014, a total of 49,714 persons died of drug-induced causes
in the United States (Tables 10, 12, and 13). This category includes
deaths from poisoning and medical conditions caused by use of
legal or illegal drugs, as well as deaths from poisoning due to
medically prescribed and other drugs. It excludes unintentional
injuries, homicides, and other causes indirectly related to drug use,
as well as newborn deaths due to the mother’s drug use. (For a list
of drug-induced causes, see Technical Notes; also see the discus￾sion of poisoning mortality that uses the more narrow definition of
poisoning as an injury in the preceding ‘‘Injury mortality by mecha￾nism and intent’’ section.)

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
	 
 
	 
 
	 
	 
 
 
 
 
National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 65 No. 4, June 30, 2016 13
In 2014, the age-adjusted death rate for drug-induced causes for
the total population increased significantly, 6.2%, from 14.6 in 2013
to 15.5 in 2014 (Internet Tables I–3 and I–4). For males in 2014, the
age-adjusted death rate for drug-induced causes was 1.6 times the
rate for females. The age-adjusted death rate for black females was
42.9% lower than for white females, and the rate for black males was
29.3% lower than for white males. The rate for drug-induced causes
increased 7.2% for males and 5.4% for females in 2014 from 2013.
Among the major race-sex and race-ethnicity-sex groups, the
age-adjusted death rates for drug-induced causes increased signifi￾cantly in 2014 from 2013 for white males (7.5%), white females (4.7%),
black males (8.6%), non-Hispanic white males (8.0%), non-Hispanic
white females (5.5%), non-Hispanic black males (7.6%), and non￾Hispanic black females (11.3%). The rate for Hispanic males did not
change significantly. The rate for Hispanic females was unchanged.
Alcohol-induced mortality
In 2014, a total of 30,722 persons died of alcohol-induced
causes in the United States (Tables 10, 12, and 13). This category
includes deaths from dependent and nondependent use of alcohol,
as well as deaths from accidental poisoning by alcohol. It excludes
unintentional injuries, homicides, and other causes indirectly related
to alcohol use, as well as deaths due to fetal alcohol syndrome (for
a list of alcohol-induced causes, see Technical Notes).
The age-adjusted death rate for alcohol-induced causes for the
total population increased significantly, 3.7%, from 8.2 in 2013 to 8.5
in 2014 (Tables I–5 and I–6). For males, the age-adjusted death rate
for alcohol-induced causes in 2014 was 2.8 times the rate for females.
Compared with the rate for the white population, the rate for the black
population was 31.9% lower.
Among the major race-sex and race-ethnicity-sex groups, the
age-adjusted rate for alcohol-induced death increased significantly in
2014 from 2013 for white males (3.8%), white females (8.9%), black
females (13.8%), Hispanic males (7.2%), non-Hispanic white males
(3.2%), non-Hispanic white females (6.3%), and non-Hispanic black
females (13.3%). The rate for non-Hispanic black males did not
change significantly.
State of residence
Mortality patterns vary considerably by state (Tables 19 and
22). The state with the highest age-adjusted death rate in 2014 was
Mississippi (937.6 per 100,000 U.S. standard population), with a rate
29.4% above the national average (724.6). The state with the lowest
age-adjusted death rate was Hawaii (588.7 per 100,000 U.S.
standard population), with a rate 18.8% below the national average.
The age-adjusted death rate for Mississippi was 59.3% higher than
the rate for Hawaii.
Variations in mortality by state are associated with differences in
socioeconomic status, race, and ethnicity composition, as well as with
differences in risk for specific causes of death (28).
Infant mortality
In 2014, a total of 23,215 deaths occurred in children under age
1 year (Tables D and 21). This number represents 225 fewer infant
deaths in 2014 than in 2013. The infant mortality rate was 5.82 per
1,000 live births, the neonatal mortality rate (deaths of infants aged
0–27 days per 1,000 live births) was 3.94, and the postneonatal
mortality rate (deaths of infants aged 28 days through 11 months per
1,000 live births) was 1.88 in 2014 (Figure 7; see Technical Notes for
information on alternative data sources). In 2014 from 2013, the
infant mortality rate decreased 2.3% and the neonatal mortality rate
decreased 2.5%. The change in the postneonatal mortality rate was
not significant.
The 10 leading causes of infant death in 2014 accounted for
69.1% of all infant deaths in the United States (Table E). By rank, the
10 leading causes were:
1.	 Congenital malformations, deformations and chromo￾somal abnormalities
2.	 Disorders related to short gestation and low birth
weight, not elsewhere classified
3.	 Newborn affected by maternal complications of preg￾nancy
4.	 Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)

In 2014, the 10 leading causes of infant death remained the
same as in 2013 (23). Changes in rates by cause of death among
the 10 leading causes were statistically significant for one condition.
In 2014, Respiratory distress of newborn (8th leading cause of infant
death) decreased by 13.5% (Table E).
Race cited on the death certificate is considered to be relatively
accurate for white and black infants (16). For other race groups,
however, race may be misreported on the death certificate (29).
Generally, infant mortality rates calculated from the linked file of live
births and infant deaths provide better measures of infant mortality by
race (29); see Technical Notes. In addition, infant mortality rates by
specified Hispanic origin and race for non-Hispanic origin that are
based on the mortality file may be somewhat understated and are
better measured using data from the linked file of live births and infant
deaths (29); see Technical Notes. Infant mortality data presented in
this report use the general mortality file, not the linked file of live births
and infant deaths.
The ratio of male to female infant mortality rates was 1.2, the
same as in 2013. The ratio of black to white infant mortality rates was
2.2 in 2014, also the same as in 2013. The infant mortality rate
decreased by 2.7% for white infants in 2014 from 2013 but did not
change significantly for black infants (Table 20).
Hispanic infant mortality—Infant mortality rates for the population
of Hispanic origin are not adjusted for misclassification; see Technical
Notes. Because these rates are not adjusted for misclassification,
caution should be exercised when interpreting rate disparities between
the Hispanic and non-Hispanic populations (16). In 2014, the infant
mortality rate for Hispanic infants was 5.22 deaths per 1,000 live births.
By comparison, for non-Hispanic white infants, the infant mortality rate
was 4.81; and for non-Hispanic black infants, the infant mortality rate
was 11.37 (data not shown). The infant mortality rate decreased 3.0%
for the non-Hispanic white population in 2014 from 2013 but did not
change significantly for the Hispanic and non-Hispanic black popu￾lations. Among Hispanic subgroups, the infant mortality rate was 6.91
per 1,000 live births for Puerto Rican, 5.94 forMexican, 3.32 for Cuban,
and 3.27 for Central and South American populations.
Additional mortality tables based on 2014 final
data
For data year 2014, trend data on drug-induced causes,
alcohol-induced causes, and firearm-related injuries are available as
supplemental tables (Tables I–1 through I–6) from the NCHS website
at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr65/nvsr65_04_tables.pdf.
Similarly, mortality data by educational attainment, marital status,
and injury at work are also available as supplemental tables
(Tables I–7 through I–10).

1For 1940–1991, data include deaths among races not shown separately; beginning in 1992, records coded as ‘‘other races’’ and records for which race was unknown, not stated, or not classifiable were assigned to the race of previous record; see Technical
 
Notes.
 
2Multiple-race data were reported by 46 states and the District of Columbia in 2014, by 42 states and the District of Columbia in 2012 and 2013, by 38 states and the District of Columbia in 2011, by 37 states and the District of Columbia in 2010, by 34
 
states and the District of Columbia in 2008 and 2009, by 27 states and the District of Columbia in 2007, by 25 states and the District of Columbia in 2006, by 21 states and the District of Columbia in 2005, by 15 states in 2004, and by 7 states in 2003; see
 
Technical Notes. The multiple-race data for these reporting areas were bridged to the single-race categories of the 1977 OMB standards for comparability with other reporting areas; see Technical Notes.
 
3Includes Aleut and Eskimo persons.
 
4Includes Chinese, Filipino, Hawaiian, Japanese, and other Asian or Pacific Islander persons.

Table 2. Number of deaths, death rates, and age-adjusted death rates, by Hispanic origin, race for non-Hispanic population, and sex: United States, 1997–2014 [Crude rates are on an annual basis per 100,000 population in specified group; age-adjusted rates are per 100,000 U.S. standard population; see Technical Notes.

Table 2. Number of deaths, death rates, and age-adjusted death rates, by Hispanic origin, race for non-Hispanic population, and sex: United States, 1997–2014—Con.
[Crude rates are on an annual basis per 100,000 population in specified group; age-adjusted rates are per 100,000 U.S. standard population; see Technical Notes. Rates are based on populations enumerated as of April 1 for 
census years and are estimated as of July 1 for all other years; see Technical Notes. Race and Hispanic origin are reported separately on the death certificate. Persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race. Data for Hispanic 
persons are not tabulated separately by race; data for non-Hispanic persons are tabulated by race. Race categories are consistent with the 1977 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) standards. Data for Hispanic origin 
should be interpreted with caution because of inconsistencies between reporting Hispanic origin on death certificates and on censuses and surveys; see Technical Notes]

1
Includes races other than white and black.
 
2
Includes Hispanic and non-Hispanic persons.
 
3
Life expectancies for the Hispanic population are based on death rates adjusted for misclassification; see Technical Notes.
 
4
Life table data for 2001–2014 are based on revised life table methodology; see Technical Notes.
 
5
Race categories are consistent with the 1977 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) standards. Multiple-race data were reported by 46 states and the District of Columbia in 2014, by 42 states
 
and the District of Columbia in 2012 and 2013, by 38 states and the District of Columbia in 2011, by 37 states and the District of Columbia in 2010, by 34 states and the District of Columbia in 2009
 
and 2008, by 27 states and the District of Columbia in 2007, by 25 states and the District of Columbia in 2006, by 21 states and the District of Columbia in 2005, by 15 states in 2004, and by 7
 
states in 2003; see Technical Notes. The multiple-race data for these reporting areas were bridged to the single-race categories of the 1977 OMB standards for comparability with other reporting areas;
 
see Technical Notes.
 
6
Life expectancies were revised using updated Medicare data; therefore, figures may differ from those previously published (see Technical Notes).

Table 15. Death rates for 113 selected causes, Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile, drug-induced causes, alcohol-induced causes, and injury by firearms, by Hispanic
origin, race for non-Hispanic population, and sex: United States, 2014—Con.
[Rates per 100,000 population in specified group. Populations used for computing death rates are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census estimated as of July 1, 2014; see Technical Notes. Race and Hispanic origin 
are reported separately on the death certificate. Persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race. Data for Hispanic persons are not tabulated separately by race; data for non-Hispanic persons are tabulated by race. Data for 
Hispanic origin should be interpreted with caution because of inconsistencies between reporting Hispanic origin on death certificates and on censuses and surveys; see Technical Notes. The asterisks (*) preceding the 
cause-of-death codes indicate that they are not part of the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD–10); see Technical Notes]

Table 19. Number of deaths, death rates, and age-adjusted death rates for major causes of death: United States, each state,
Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and Northern Marianas, 2014—Con.
[Rates per 100,000 population; age-adjusted rates per 100,000 U.S. standard population; see Technical Notes. Populations used for computing death rates are postcensal 
estimates based on the 2010 census estimated as of July 1, 2014; see Technical Notes. Codes in parentheses after causes of death are categories of the International
Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD–10). The asterisks (*) preceding the cause-of-death codes indicate that they are not part of ICD–10; see Technical Notes]

Race categories are consistent with the 1977 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) standards. In 2014, multiple-race data were reported by 46 states and the District of Columbia for deaths and
 
by 49 states and the District of Columbia for births; see Technical Notes. The multiple-race data for these reporting areas were bridged to the single-race categories of the 1977 OMB standards for
 
comparability with other reporting areas; see Technical Notes.

Technical Notes
Nature and sources of data
Data in this report are based on information from all death 
certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia, and 
are processed by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). 
Data for 2014 are based on records of deaths that occurred during 
2014 and were received as of July 27, 2015. 
The U.S. Standard Certificate of Death, which is used as a model 
by the states, was revised in 2003 (30). Prior to 2003, the standard 
certificate of death had not been revised since 1989 (31). This report 
includes data for 46 states (Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, 
Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, 
Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, 
Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, 
Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North 
Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, 
Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, 
Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) and the 
District of Columbia that used the 2003 revision of the U.S. Standard 
Certificate of Death in 2014; and for the remaining 4 states that 
collected and reported death data in 2014 based on the 1989 revision 
of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Death. Massachusetts began using 
the 2003 revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Death in Sep￾tember 2014, and Virginia began using the 2003 revision in November 
2014, so some data for those two states were reported using the 1989 
revision. 
Because most of the items presented in this report appear largely 
comparable despite changes to item wording and format in the 2003 
death certificate revision, data from both groups of states are com￾bined unless otherwise stated. Data for American Samoa, Guam, 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (Northern Marianas), 
and Puerto Rico are included in tables showing data by state but are 
not included in U.S. totals. In 2014, Guam and Northern Marianas 
collected and reported death data using the 2003 revision of the U.S. 
Standard Certificate of Death. American Samoa and Puerto Rico 
collected and reported death data in 2014 using the 1989 revision. 
Data for Virgin Islands for the 2014 data year were not available at 
the time of file closing. 
Mortality statistics are based on information submitted by the 
jurisdictions and coded by NCHS through the Vital Statistics Coop￾erative Program. For the 2014 data year, all states, the District of 
Columbia, New York City, and Puerto Rico submitted mortality medical 
data in electronic data files to NCHS. American Samoa, Guam, and 
Northern Marianas submitted copies of death certificates from which 
NCHS entered and coded all medical data. All states, the District of 
Columbia, New York City, American Samoa, and Puerto Rico sub￾mitted mortality demographic data in electronic data files to NCHS. All 
demographic data for Guam and Northern Marianas were entered and 
coded by NCHS from copies of death certificates submitted to NCHS. 
Data for the entire United States refer to events occurring within 
the United States. Data shown for geographic areas are by place of 
residence. Beginning with 1970, mortality statistics for the United 
States exclude deaths of nonresidents of the United States. All data 
exclude fetal deaths. 
Mortality statistics for American Samoa, Northern Marianas, and 
Puerto Rico exclude deaths of nonresidents for each area. For Guam, 
National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 65 No. 4, June 30, 2016 103
however, mortality statistics exclude deaths that occurred to a resident 
of any place other than Guam or the United States (50 states and the 
District of Columbia). 
Cause-of-death classification
The mortality statistics presented in this report were compiled in 
accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) regulations, 
which specify that member countries classify and code causes of 
death in accordance with the current revision of the International
Classification of Diseases (ICD). ICD provides the basic guidance 
used in virtually all countries to code and classify causes of death. 
Effective with deaths occurring in 1999, the United States began 
using the Tenth Revision of this classification (ICD–10) (32). For 
earlier years, causes of death were classified according to the 
revisions then in use: 1979–1998, Ninth Revision; 1968–1978, 
Eighth Revision, adapted for use in the United States; 1958–1967, 
Seventh Revision; and 1949–1957, Sixth Revision. 
Changes in classification of causes of death due to these revi￾sions may result in discontinuities in cause-of-death trends. Conse￾quently, cause-of-death comparisons among revisions require 
consideration of comparability ratios and, where available, estimates 
of their standard errors. Comparability ratios between the Ninth and 
Tenth revisions, Eighth and Ninth revisions, Seventh and Eighth 
revisions, and Sixth and Seventh revisions may be found in other 
NCHS reports and independent tabulations (33–38). 
ICD not only details disease classification but also provides 
definitions, tabulation lists, the format of the death certificate, and the 
rules for coding cause of death. Cause-of-death data presented in this 
publication were coded by procedures outlined in annual issues of the 
NCHS Instruction Manual (6,39,40). ICD includes rules for selecting 
the underlying cause of death and regulations on the use of ICD. 
Prior to data year 1968, mortality medical data were based on 
manual coding of an underlying cause of death for each certificate, 
in accordance with WHO rules. Effective with data year 1968, NCHS 
converted to computerized coding of the underlying cause and manual 
coding of all causes (multiple causes) on the death certificate. In this 
system, called ‘‘Automated Classification of Medical Entities’’ (ACME) 
(41), multiple-cause codes are inputted to computer software that uses 
WHO rules to select the underlying cause. All cause-of-death data in 
this report are coded using ACME. 
The ACME system is used to select the underlying cause of death 
for all death certificates in the United States. In addition, NCHS 
developed two computer systems as inputs to ACME. Beginning with 
1990 data, the Mortality Medical Indexing, Classification, and Retrieval 
system (MICAR) (42,43) was introduced to automate the coding of 
multiple causes of death. In addition, MICAR provides more detailed 
information on the conditions reported on death certificates than is 
available through ICD code structure. Beginning with data year 1993, 
SuperMICAR (44), an enhancement of the MICAR system, was intro￾duced, allowing for literal entry of the multiple cause-of-death text as 
reported by the certifier. This information is then automatically pro￾cessed by the MICAR and ACME computer systems. Records that 
cannot be automatically processed by MICAR are manually multiple￾cause coded and then further processed through ACME to determine 
the underlying cause of death. In 2014, SuperMICAR (44) was used 
to process all of the country’s death records. 
In this report, tabulations of cause-of-death statistics are based 
solely on the underlying cause of death. The underlying cause is 
The 2014 mortality data file was updated to include amended information from two states affecting 125 records previously coded to Accidental 
discharge of firearms (W32–W34). Those 125 records were recoded to C34.9 (1 record), E66.8 (1), K90.2 (1), P29.0 (1), X72 (1), X73 (8), X74 
(43), X94 (1), X95 (62), Y23 (1), Y24 (4), and Y87.0 (1). Affected tables in this report include B, E, 9–19, and 21, as well as Internet tables I–1 
and I–2. Text on page 12 was also updated. The shaded areas in this report indicate data changes from those previously published.

defined by WHO as ‘‘the disease or injury which initiated the train of 
events leading directly to death, or the circumstances of the accident 
or violence which produced the fatal injury’’ (32). The underlying cause 
is selected from the conditions entered by the medical certifier in the 
cause-of-death section of the death certificate. When more than one 
cause or condition is entered by the medical certifier, the underlying 
cause is determined by the sequence of conditions on the certificate, 
provisions of ICD, and associated selection rules and modifications. 
Generally, more medical information is reported on death certificates 
than is directly reflected in the underlying cause of death. This is 
captured in NCHS multiple cause-of-death statistics (45–47). 
Tabulation lists and cause-of-death ranking
Tabulation lists for ICD–10 are published in the NCHS Instruc￾tion Manual, Part 9, ‘‘ICD–10 Cause-of-Death Lists for Tabulating 
Mortality Statistics’’ (updated March 2011 to include WHO updates to 
ICD–10 for data year 2011) (48). For this report, two tabulation lists 
are used: a) ‘‘List of 113 Selected Causes of Death’’ and Entero￾colitis due to Clostridium difficile (the title of which was modified in 
2009 to include Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile), used for 
deaths of all ages; and b) ‘‘List of 130 Selected Causes of Infant 
Death,’’ used for infants (48). These lists are also used to rank 
leading causes of death for the two population groups. For the list of 
113 causes, the group titles of Major cardiovascular diseases 
(ICD–10 codes I00–I78), and Symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical 
and laboratory findings, not elsewhere classified (R00–R99), are not 
ranked. In addition, category titles that begin with the words ‘‘other’’ 
and ‘‘all other’’ are not ranked to determine the leading causes of 
death. When one of the titles that represents a subtotal is 
ranked—for example, Tuberculosis (A16–A19)—its component parts 
are not ranked, as in this case, Respiratory tuberculosis (A16) and 
Other tuberculosis (A17–A19). For the list of 130 causes of infant 
death, the same ranking procedures are used except that the 
category of major cardiovascular diseases is not on the list. More 
detail regarding ranking procedures can be found in ‘‘Deaths: 
Leading Causes for 2014’’ (2). 
Leading cause-of-death trends discussed in this report are based 
on cause-of-death data according to ICD–10 for 1999–2014 and 
ICD–9 for the most comparable cause-of-death titles for 1979–1998. 
Tables showing ICD–9 categories that are comparable with ICD–10 
titles in the ‘‘List of 113 Selected Causes of Death’’ may be found in 
the reports ‘‘Comparability of Cause of Death between ICD–9 and 
ICD–10: Preliminary Estimates’’ (35) and ‘‘Deaths: Final Data for 1999’’ 
(49). Although, in some cases, categories from the ‘‘List of 113 
Selected Causes of Death’’ are identical to those in the earlier ‘‘List 
of 72 Selected Causes of Death’’ used with ICD–9, caution must be 
used because many of these categories are not comparable even 
though the cause-of-death titles may be the same. 
Trend data for 1979–1998 that are classified by ICD–9 but sorted 
into the ‘‘List of 113 Selected Causes of Death’’ developed for ICD–10 
can be found on the mortality website at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/ 
statab/hist001r.pdf. 
Revision of ICD and resulting changes in classification and rules 
for selecting the underlying cause of death have important implications 
for the analysis of mortality trends by cause of death. For some causes 
of death, the discontinuity in trend can be substantial (33,35). There￾fore, considerable caution should be used in analyzing cause-of-death 
trends for periods of time that extend across more than one revision 
of ICD. 
Codes added or deleted in 2014
No ICD–10 codes were added or deleted in data year 2014. 
Information on categories added or deleted in previous years is 
available from: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/dvs/Part9Instruction 
Manual2011.pdf (48). 
Codes for terrorism
Beginning with data for 2001, NCHS introduced categories 
*U01–*U03 for classifying and coding deaths due to acts of 
terrorism. The asterisks before the category codes indicate that they 
are not part of ICD–10. Deaths classified to the terrorism categories 
are included in the 113 causes of death list in the categories for 
Assault (homicide) and Intentional self-harm (suicide), and in the 130 
causes of death list for infants in the category for Assault (homicide). 
Additional information on these new categories is available from: 
http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/terrorism_code.htm. No deaths were 
assigned to terrorism categories in 2014. 
Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile
The number of deaths from Enterocolitis due to Clostridium
difficile (C. difficile) (ICD–10 code A04.7) increased dramatically from 
793 deaths in 1999 to a high of 8,085 deaths in 2011. Since 2011, 
the number decreased each year to 7,739 deaths in 2012, 7,665 in 
2013, and 7,130 in 2014. Data for C. difficile are included in tables 
showing data for 113 selected causes of death in ‘‘Certain other 
intestinal infections (A04, A07–A09)’’ but were not identified sepa￾rately until 2006. Because of the increasing importance of this cause 
of death, beginning with data year 2006, data for C. difficile are 
shown separately at the bottom of tables showing 113 selected 
causes, and C. difficile was added to the list of rankable causes. 
Quality of reporting and processing cause of
death
Quality of mortality data is largely dependent on proper and 
thorough completion of death certificates by certifiers. Accuracy and 
completeness of information entered on death certificates can vary 
by state from year to year. 
One index of the quality of reporting causes of death is the 
proportion of death certificates coded to Chapter XVIII—Symptoms, 
signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, not elsewhere 
classified (ICD–10 codes R00–R99). Although which deaths occur for 
which underlying causes are impossible to determine, the proportion 
coded to R00–R99 indicates the consideration given to the cause￾of-death statement by the medical certifier. This proportion also may 
be used as a rough measure of specificity of medical diagnoses made 
by the certifier in various areas. The percentage of all reported deaths 
in the United States assigned to Symptoms, signs and abnormal

Manner of death information on the death certificate defines the 
circumstances under which the death occurred. The classification 
(natural, accident [unintentional injuries], suicide, homicide) selected 
when the death certificate is completed can affect the coding of 
underlying cause of death. In Tennessee, the number of certificates 
with a blank entry for ‘‘Manner of Death’’ increased from 137 in 2013 
to 600 in 2014. Most of these records (560) were assigned to unin￾tentional injuries. Some causes of death may have been significantly 
impacted. For example, the number of deaths in Tennessee from 
Discharge from other and unspecified firearms, W34, increased from 
18 in 2013 to 90 in 2014 and the number of deaths from Other 
accidental hanging and strangulation, W76, increased from 0 in 2013 
to 26 in 2014. If manner of death had been specified, many of these 
deaths would have likely been assigned a more specific underlying 
cause of death code. Rules for coding a cause or causes of death may 
sometimes require modification when evidence suggests it will 
improve the quality of cause-of-death data. Prior to 1999, such modi￾fications were made only when a new ICD revision was implemented. 
A process for updating ICD was introduced with ICD–10 that allows 
for midrevision changes. These changes, however, may affect com￾parability of data between years for selected causes of death. 
Detail on coding and classification rule changes for 2014 as well 
as previous years can be found in the instruction manual ‘‘ICD–10 
ACME Decision Tables for Classifying Underlying Causes of Death’’ 
available from: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/instruction_manuals.htm 
(41). Trend data for causes of death affected by coding rule changes 
should be interpreted with caution. 
Rare causes of death
Selected causes of death considered to be of public health 
concern are supposed to be routinely confirmed by states according 
to agreed-upon procedures between state vital statistics programs 
and NCHS. These causes, termed ‘‘infrequent and rare causes of 
death,’’ are listed in the NCHS Instruction Manual, Parts 2a, 11, and 
20 (39,50,51). In 2014, some states did not confirm some or all 
deaths from rare causes. 
Injury mortality by mechanism and intent
Injury mortality data are presented using the external cause of 
injury mortality matrix for ICD–10 (Table 18). In this framework, 
cause-of-injury deaths are organized principally by mechanism (e.g., 
firearm or poisoning), and secondarily by manner or intent of death 
(e.g., unintentional, suicide, or homicide). 
The number of deaths for selected causes in this framework may 
differ from those shown in tables that use the standard mortality 
tabulation lists. Following WHO conventions, standard mortality tabu￾lations (Table 10) present external causes of death (ICD–10 codes 
*U01–*U03 and V01–Y89); in contrast, the matrix (Table 18) excludes 
deaths classified as Complications of medical and surgical care 
(Y40–Y84 and Y88). For additional information on injury data pre￾sented in this framework, see the report ‘‘Deaths: Injuries, 2002,’’ 
available from: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr54/nvsr54_ 
10.pdf (52). Data for later years are available through CDC’s 
WONDER system at http://wonder.cdc.gov/ or through CDC’s 
National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 65 No. 4, June 30, 2016 105
WISQARS at http://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/index.html. Implemen￾tation of changes to ICD–10 may affect the matrix, requiring modifi￾cation of codes in selected categories. No changes were made to the 
matrix in 2014. For more information on the latest ICD–10 external 
cause-of-injury codes included in the matrix, see http://www.cdc.gov/

Race and Hispanic origin
The 2003 revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Death 
allows the reporting of more than one race (multiple races) (30). This 
change was implemented to reflect the increasing diversity of the 
U.S. population and to be consistent with the decennial census. The 
race and ethnicity items on the revised certificate are compliant with 
the 1997 ‘‘Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of 
Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity,’’ issued by the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) (14). This revision replaced stan￾dards that were issued in 1977 (53). The new standards mandate 
the collection of more than one race where applicable for federal 
data (14). In addition, the new death certificate is compliant with the 
OMB-mandated minimum set of five races to be reported for federal 
data (30). Multiple race includes any combination of white, black or 
African American, American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN), Asian, 
and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (NHOPI). If two or 
more specific subgroups such as Korean and Chinese are reported, 
these count as a single race of Asian rather than as multiple races. 
The number of states reporting multiple race has increased, from 
7 states in 2003 to 46 states and the District of Columbia in 2014 
(Table I). In 2014, more than one race was reported for 0.4% of the 
records in the 46 states and the District of Columbia that reported 
multiple-race (Table II). Although still uncommon, multiple races were 
reported more often for younger decedents than for older decedents 
(2.6% of decedents under age 25 compared with 0.7% of decedents 
aged 25–64 and 0.3% of decedents aged 65 and over). In 2014, only 
two decedents were reported as having more than four races. The race 
category reported most often in combination with one or more other 
races was NHOPI. In 2014, more than one race was reported on 39.5% 
of records reporting NHOPI on the death certificate, 24.0% of records 
reporting AIAN, 6.3% of records reporting Asian, 1.0% of records 
reporting black, and 0.5% of records reporting white. 
Data from vital records based on the 1989 revision of the U.S. 
Standard Certificate of Death follow the 1977 OMB standard, allowing 
only a single race to be reported (31,53). The 1977 standard stipulates 
that states must report a minimum set of four races: white, black or

Includes records for which race was reported as ‘‘other.’’ Future processing assigns ‘‘other’’ race to one of the recognized categories. ‘‘Other’’ race comprises a wide variety of responses; however,
 
the most common is to check ‘‘other’’ and not provide future specification or to report a Hispanic group as a race.
 
NOTE: AIAN is American Indian or Alaska Native, and NHOPI is Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander.
 
African American, AIAN, and Asian or Pacific Islander (API). Under 
these standards, data for API persons were collected as a single 
group; that is, data for Asian persons were not reported separately 
from NHOPI persons (53). The 1997 OMB guidelines provide for the 
reporting of Asian persons separately from NHOPI persons (14). 
Some death certificates currently collect only one race for the 
decedent in the same categories as specified in the 1977 OMB 
guidelines; therefore, death certificate data by race—the source of the 
numerators for death rates—are currently incompatible with the popu￾lation data collected in the 2000 and 2010 censuses, intercensal 
estimates for 1991–1999 and 2001–2009, and postcensal estimates 
for 2011–2014—the denominators for the rates. To produce death 
rates by race, the reported population data for multiple-race persons 
had to be ‘‘bridged’’ to single-race categories. To provide uniformity and 
comparability of data during the transition period, before all or most 
of the data become available in the multiple-race format, the responses 
of those for whom more than one race was reported (multiple race) 
must be ‘‘bridged’’ to a single race. The bridging procedure is similar 
to that used to bridge multiracial population estimates (15,54). Mul￾tiracial decedents are imputed to a single race (white, black, AIAN, or 
API) according to their combination of races, Hispanic origin, sex, and 
age indicated on the death certificate. The imputation procedure is 
described in detail at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/dvs/Multiple_ 
race_documentation_5-10-04.pdf. Similarly, when calculating infant 
mortality rates, multiracial infants are bridged to a single race. The 
bridging procedure for multiple-race mothers and fathers is based on

the procedure used to bridge the multiple-race population estimates 
(29); see ‘‘Infant mortality rates’’ section. 
Race and Hispanic origin are reported separately on the death 
certificate. Therefore, data shown by race include persons of Hispanic 
and non-Hispanic origin, and data for Hispanic origin include persons 
of any race. In this report, unless otherwise specified, deaths of 
persons of Hispanic origin are included in the totals for each race 
group—white, black, AIAN, and API—according to the decedent’s race 
as reported on the death certificate. 
Mortality data for the Hispanic-origin population are based on 
deaths of residents of all 50 states and the District of Columbia. 
Quality of race and Hispanic origin data—Death rates for His￾panic, AIAN, and API persons should be interpreted with caution 
because of inconsistencies in reporting Hispanic origin or race on the 
death certificate compared with censuses, surveys, and birth certifi￾cates. Studies have shown underreporting on death certificates of 
AIAN, API, and Hispanic decedents, as well as undercounts of these 
groups in censuses (16,17,55,56). 
A number of studies have been conducted on the reliability of race 
reported on the death certificate by comparing it with race reported 
on another data collection instrument, such as the census or a survey 
(14,17,55,56). Inconsistencies may arise because of differences in 
who provides race information on the compared records. Race infor￾mation on the death certificate is reported by a funeral director as 
provided by an informant or, in the absence of an informant, on the 
basis of observation. In contrast, race in the census or the U.S. Census 
Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) is obtained while the 
person is alive; in these cases, race is self-reported or reported by 
another member of the household familiar with the person and, 
therefore, may be considered more valid. A high level of agreement 
between the death certificate and the census or survey report is 
essential to assure unbiased death rates by race. 
Studies (55,56) show that a person self-reported as AIAN or API 
on census or survey records was sometimes reported as white on the 
death certificate. Using the National Longitudinal Mortality Study, Arias 
et al. examined the reliability of race and Hispanic origin reported on 
about 250,000 death certificates compared with that reported on a total 
of 26 Current Population Surveys (CPS) conducted by the Census 
Bureau for 1979–1998 (16,17). Agreement between the two sources 
was found to be excellent for the white and black populations, both 
exhibiting CPS to death certificate ratios of 1.00. On the other hand, 
substantial differences were found for other race groups. The ratio of 
CPS to death certificates was found to be 1.30 for the AIAN population 
and 1.07 for the API population, indicating net underreporting on death 
certificates of 30% for AIAN and 7% for API. The ratio of deaths for 
CPS to death certificates for Hispanic persons was found to be 1.05, 
indicating a net underreporting on death certificates for the Hispanic 
population of 5%. The net effect of misclassification is an underes￾timation of deaths and death rates for the API and AIAN races and 
for Hispanic origin. 
In addition, undercoverage of minority groups in the census and 
resultant population estimates introduces biases into death rates by 
race and Hispanic origin (16,17,55–58). Unlike the 1990 census, 
coverage error in the 2000 census was found to be statistically 
significant only for the non-Hispanic white population (overcounted by 
approximately 1.13%) and non-Hispanic black population (undercounted 
by approximately 1.84%) (57). Overall, the 2010 census coverage error 
was minor with a net overcount of 0.01%. The net undercounts were 
statistically different from zero for the following groups: non-Hispanic black 
(2.06%), non-Hispanic white (–0.83%), Hispanic (1.54%), and AIAN 
(4.88% on reservations and –1.95% off reservations) populations. The net 
undercounts were not statistically different from zero for the Asian (0.08%) 
and NHOPI (1.34%) populations (59). 
Data on the Central and South American and Other Hispanic 
origin populations are affected by whether a state submits literal text 
to NCHS, thereby making it possible to identify decedents as being 
of Central and South American origin. Before 2008, decedents iden￾tified as ‘‘Dominican’’ were classified as Central and South American. 
Starting in 2008, Dominican decedents are included among ‘‘Other and 
unknown Hispanic’’ and are no longer counted among Central and 
South American decedents. Data year 1997 was the first year in which 
mortality data for the Hispanic population were available for the entire 
United States. 
Other races and race not stated—Beginning in 1992, all records 
coded as ‘‘other races’’ (0.68% of total deaths in 2014) were assigned 
to the specified race of the previous record. Records for which race 
was unknown, not stated, or not classifiable (0.34%) were assigned 
the racial designation of the previous record. 
Infant mortality rates—For 1989–2014, as in previous years, 
infant deaths continue to be tabulated by the race of the decedent. 
However, beginning with the 1989 data year, the method of tabulating 
live births by race was changed from race of parents to race of mother, 
as stated on the birth certificate (60). This change affects infant 
mortality rates because live births are the denominators of these rates 
(4,61). To improve continuity and ease of interpretation, trend data by 
race in this report have been retabulated by race of mother for all years 
beginning with the 1980 data year. 
Quantitatively, the change in the basis for tabulating live births by 
race of mother results in more white births and fewer black births and 
births of other races. Consequently, infant mortality rates under the 
new tabulating procedure tend to be about 2% lower for white infants 
and about 5% higher for black infants than when they are computed 
by the previous method of tabulating live births by race of parents. 
Rates for most other minority races also are higher when computed 
by race of mother (61). 
In 2014, multiple race was reported on the revised birth certifi￾cates of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, 
Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illi￾nois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, 
Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey (after January 1), 
New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Okla￾homa, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Ten￾nessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, 
Wisconsin, Wyoming, Guam, and Northern Marianas, and on the 
unrevised birth certificates of Rhode Island (62). 
Infant mortality rates for the Hispanic-origin population are based 
on numbers of resident infant deaths reported to be of Hispanic origin 
and numbers of resident live births by Hispanic origin of mother for 
the United States. In computing infant mortality rates, deaths and live 
births of unknown origin are not distributed among the specified 
Hispanic and non-Hispanic groups. In the United States in 2014, the 
percentage of infant deaths of unknown origin was 1.1%, and the 
percentage of live births to mothers of unknown origin was 0.8%. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 65 No. 4, June 30, 2016 109
Small numbers of infant deaths for specific Hispanic-origin groups 
result in infant mortality rates subject to relatively large random varia￾tion (see ‘‘Random variation’’ section). 
Infant mortality rates calculated from the general mortality file for 
specified race and Hispanic origin contain errors because of reporting 
problems that affect the classification of race and Hispanic origin on 
the birth and death certificates for the same infant. Infant mortality 
rates by specified race and Hispanic origin are more accurate when 
based on the linked file of infant deaths and live births (29). The linked 
file computes infant mortality rates using the race and Hispanic origin 
of the mother from the birth certificate in both the numerator and 
denominator of the rate. In addition, the mother’s race and Hispanic 
origin from the birth certificate are considered to be more accurately 
reported than the infant’s race and Hispanic origin from the death 
certificate—on the birth certificate, race and Hispanic origin are gen￾erally reported by the mother at the time of delivery, whereas on the 
death certificate, the infant’s race and Hispanic origin are reported by 
an informant, usually the mother but sometimes the funeral director. 
Estimates of reporting errors have been made by comparing rates 
based on the linked files with those in which the infant’s race and 
Hispanic origin are based on information from the death certificate 
(29,55). 
Life tables
The life table provides a comprehensive measure of the effect 
of mortality on life expectancy. It is composed of sets of values 
showing the mortality experience of a hypothetical group of infants 
born at the same time and subject throughout their lifetime to the 
age-specific death rates of a particular time period, usually a given 
year. Prior to data year 1997, U.S. life tables were abridged and 
constructed by reference to a standard table (63). In addition, the 
age range for these life tables was limited to 5-year age groups 
ending with age group 85 and over. Beginning with final data 
reported for 1997, complete life tables were constructed by single 
years of age extending to age 100 (64) using a methodology similar 
to that of the 1989–1991 decennial life tables (65). The methodology 
was again revised for data years 2000–2007 using a methodology 
similar to that of the 1999–2001 decennial life tables (66). 
Research into the methodology used for the 1999–2001 decen￾nial life tables, which was applied to the 2000–2007 annual life tables, 
revealed that it is not necessary to model (or ‘‘smooth’’) the prob￾abilities of death beginning at age 66. The observed blended vital 
statistics and Medicare data for ages 66–85 are robust enough and 
do not require additional smoothing. Beginning with final data reported 
for 2008 (67), the life table methodology was refined by changing the 
smoothing technique used to estimate the life table functions at the 
oldest ages. This revision improves upon the methodologies used 
previously. Beginning with the 2008 data year, the methodology used 
to produce the life tables does not model the probabilities of death 
beginning at age 66 but rather at ages above 85 or so. (The exact 
ages at which smoothing techniques are used depend on the popu￾lation.) See ‘‘United States Life Tables, 2008’’ for a detailed description 
of the new methodology (68). Life expectancy values in this report for 
2010 and 2011 were revised using updated Medicare data; therefore, 
these values may differ from those previously published. Life expec￾tancy values for 2012–2014 will be revised in future annual reports 
when updated Medicare data for those years become available (68). 
Historically, NCHS has produced annual life tables by race 
including the white and black populations but did not produce life tables 
for other racial or ethnic groups. Beginning with data year 2006 
(originally published elsewhere) (69), NCHS began producing life 
tables by Hispanic origin after conducting research into the quality of 
race and ethnicity reporting on death certificates and developing 
methodologies to correct for misclassification of these populations on 
death certificates (16,17). These methods that adjust for misclassifi￾cation are applied to the production of the life tables, but not to the 
death rates shown throughout this report. Life tables by Hispanic origin 
are shown in this report with trend data from 2006 to 2014 (Table 8). 
Life expectancy data presented in this report for 2001–2009 were 
re-estimated using the new life table methodology presented with final 
data year 2008 and with revised 2001–2009 intercensal population 
estimates produced by the Census Bureau (68). Although the life table 
methodology used produces complete life tables (by single years of 
age), the life table data shown in this report are summarized in 5-year 
age groupings. 
Causes of death contributing to changes in life
expectancy
A life table partitioning technique was used to estimate causes 
of death contributing to changes in life expectancy in this report. The 
method partitions changes into component additive parts and 
identifies the causes of death having the greatest influence, positive 
or negative, on changes in life expectancy (70–72). 
Infant mortality
Infant mortality rates are the most commonly used index for 
measuring the risk of dying during the first year of life. The rates 
presented in this report are calculated by dividing the number of 
infant deaths in a calendar year by the number of live births 
registered for the same period, and are presented as rates per 1,000 
or per 100,000 live births. For final birth figures used in the 
denominator for infant mortality rates, see the report ‘‘Births: Final 
Data for 2014’’ (62). In contrast to infant mortality rates based on live 
births, infant death rates are based on the estimated population 
under age 1 year. Infant death rates that appear in tabulations of 
age-specific death rates in this report are calculated by dividing the 
number of infant deaths by the July 1, 2014, population estimate of 
persons under age 1, based on 2010 census populations. These 
rates are presented per 100,000 population in this age group. 
Because of differences in the denominators, infant death rates may 
differ from infant mortality rates. 
There are two sources of infant mortality data: a) the general 
mortality file and b) the linked file of live births and infant deaths. Data 
from the linked file differs from the infant mortality data presented in 
this report because the linked file includes only events in which both 
the birth and the death occur in the United States, and late-filed births. 
Processing of the linked file allows for further exclusion of infant 
records due to duplicates and records with additional information that 
raise questions about an infant’s age. Although the differences are 
usually very small, infant mortality rates based on the linked file tend 
to be somewhat smaller than those based on data from the general 
mortality file as presented in this report. The linked file is the preferred 
source for infant mortality by race because it uses the mother’s

self-reported race from the child’s birth certificate (29), which is more 
reliable than the infant’s race listed on the death certificate, and 
because the numerator and denominator are referring to the same 
person’s race. 
Other variables available online
Marital status
Mortality data by marital status no longer appear in the printed 
version of this report but are available in Internet Table I–7 from the 
NCHS website at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr65/nvsr65_ 
04_tables.pdf. Mortality data by marital status are generally of high 
quality. A study of death certificate data using the 1986 National 
Mortality Followback Survey showed a high level of consistency in 
reporting marital status (58). 
Age-specific rates in Table I–7 were computed using population 
estimates from the 2014 1-year ACS (73) (for additional detail, see 
‘‘Population bases for computing rates’’ section). Age-adjusted death 
rates were computed based on age-specific rates and the standard 
population for those aged 25 and over. Prior to data year 2010, death 
rates by marital status were computed using population estimates from 
CPS. Rates computed using population estimates from ACS may not 
be comparable with rates computed using population estimates from 
CPS. Furthermore, previously published rates by marital status for 
2001–2009 were computed using population estimates based on the 
2000 census; therefore, rates by marital status for 2010–2014 are not 
comparable with previously published rates for earlier years. 
Although Table I–7 shows age-specific death rates by marital 
status for age group 15–24, these rates are not included in the 
computation of the age-adjusted rate because of their high variability, 
particularly for the widowed population. Furthermore, age groups 
75–84 and 85 and over are combined because of high variability in 
death rates among those aged 85 and over, particularly for the 
never-married population. 
Educational attainment
Mortality data by educational attainment no longer appear in the 
printed version of this report but are available in Internet Table I–8 
from the NCHS website at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/ 
nvsr65/nvsr65_04_tables.pdf. Beginning in 2003, some registration 
areas adopted the new Standard Certificate of Death, which includes 
a revised educational attainment item. The revised item is consistent 
with U.S. Census Bureau efforts to improve the ability to identify 
specific degrees and persons who had completed 12 years of 
education but did not hold either a high school diploma or General 
Educational Development high school equivalency diploma, known 
as GED. Based on Census Bureau testing, the new item identifies 
about 2% more persons with less than a high school diploma or 
equivalent, 13% fewer persons with a high school diploma, and 8% 
more persons with at least some college (74). In 2014, the District of 
Columbia and 43 states used the revised item: Alaska, Arizona, 
Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, 
Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, 
Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, 
Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New 
York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, 
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, 
Utah, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. The unre￾vised education item continued to be used by 4 states: Alabama, 
Colorado, Maryland, and West Virginia. Massachusetts and Virginia 
implemented the revised certificate after January 1; therefore, the 
old education item was used for part of the year and the revised item 
was used for part of the year. 
Because some states do not yet use the new educational attain￾ment item and because the revised and unrevised versions are not 
fully comparable, data by educational attainment are shown separately 
according to the revision status of the decedent’s state of occurrence. 
Table I–8 shows mortality data for ages 25–64 by educational attain￾ment for states using the 2003 version of the standard death certificate 
and, separately, for states using the 1989 version. Data were approxi￾mately 80% or more complete on a state-of-occurrence basis. Data 
for Massachusetts and Virginia are excluded because they did not use 
the new item for the entire year (see preceding ‘‘Nature and sources 
of data’’ section). Data for Rhode Island were not included because 
the educational attainment item was not on the state’s certificate. Data 
are not shown for ages under 25 because persons under age 25 may 
not have completed their education. Data for those aged 65 and over 
are not shown because reporting quality is poorer at older ages (75). 
Age-adjusted death rates by educational attainment were computed 
based on the age-specific rates and the standard population for those 
aged 25–64. 
Rates by educational attainment for states using the unrevised 
certificate are affected by differences between measurement of edu￾cation for the numerator, which is based on the number of years of 
education completed as reported on the 1989 revision of the death 
certificate, and the denominator, which is based on highest degree 
completed as reported in ACS (73). 
Table III shows a 2002 to 2014 comparison of the percent dis￾tribution of deaths by measures of educational attainment for areas 
using the 2003 revised certificate in 2014 and for the same areas using 
the 1989 revision. Georgia and South Dakota are excluded because 
those states were not reporting education in 2002 and, therefore, do 
not have comparison data. Rhode Island was not included because 
the state’s certificate does not have an educational attainment item. 
Massachusetts and Virginia are excluded because they did not use 
the new item for the entire year. Alabama, Colorado, Maryland, and 
West Virginia are excluded because they were still using the 1989 
revision. 
Injury at work
Mortality data by injury at work are available in Internet 
Tables I–9 and I–10 from the NCHS website at http://www.cdc.gov/ 
nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr65/nvsr65_04_tables.pdf. Information on deaths 
attributed to injuries at work is derived from a separate item on the 
death certificate that asks the medical certifier whether the death 
resulted from an injury sustained at work. This item is on the death 
certificate of all states. Number of deaths, age-specific death rates, 
and age-adjusted death rates for injury at work are shown in 
Tables I–9 and I–10. Deaths, crude death rates, and age-adjusted 
death rates for injury at work are shown for those aged 15 and over. 
Age-adjusted death rates for injury at work were computed using 
age-specific death rates and the 2000 U.S. standard population for 
those aged 15 and over; see ‘‘Computing rates’’ section.

Maternal mortality
Maternal mortality data are not included in this year’s report. 
The 2003 revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Death 
introduced a checkbox question format with categories to take 
advantage of additional codes available in ICD–10 for deaths with a 
connection to pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium. As states 
revise their death certificates, most are adopting the checkbox 
format, resulting in wider adoption of a pregnancy status question 
nationwide and greater standardization of the particular question 
used. In 2014, the District of Columbia and all states except 
Colorado and West Virginia had a separate question related to 
pregnancy status of female decedents around the time of their 
death. The 2003 standard format of the question was used by 45 
states and the District of Columbia. Other formats of the question 
were used by Alabama, California, and Maryland for the entire year 
and Virginia until November when they began using the 2003 
standard format. 
Adopting a pregnancy status question consistent with the stan￾dard death certificate increases the identification of maternal deaths 
(76,77). Maternal mortality rates are consistently greater for those 
states with the additional information from the separate question than 
for the states without it. In addition, state maternal mortality rates tend 
to be greater after adopting the standard question than before. 
Research on this issue (77–79) indicates that this increase represents 
an improvement in identifying maternal deaths. For example, a study 
in Maryland that used multiple data sources as the standard showed 
an improvement in identifying maternal deaths (from 62% to 98%) after 
adoption of a pregnancy checkbox item consistent with the 2003 
standard certificate (79). 
Population bases for computing rates
Populations used for computing death rates and life tables 
shown in this report (except for rates by Hispanic subgroup in 
Table 5, rates by marital status in Internet Table I–7, and rates by 
educational attainment in Internet Table I–8) represent the population 
residing in the United States, enumerated as of April 1 for census 
years and estimated as of July 1 for all other years. Population 
estimates used to compute death rates for the United States for 
2014 are shown for 5-year age groups by race in Table IV and by 
Hispanic origin for the total Hispanic population in Table V. These 
estimates are available by single years of age from http://www.cdc. 
gov/nchs/nvss/bridged_race.htm (12). 
Population estimates and their standard errors in Table VI for 
specified Hispanic populations (Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Cen￾tral and South American, and Other Hispanic populations), in Table VII 
by marital status, and in Table VIII by educational attainment were 
prepared by the Census Bureau. These estimates are based on the 
2014 1-year ACS (73) adjusted to resident population control totals 
and, as such, are subject to sampling variation; see ‘‘Random varia￾tion’’ section. The control totals used for population estimates in 
Tables VI and VII are 2010-based postcensal estimates for the United 
States for July 1, 2014. The control totals used for population estimates 
in Table VIII are 2010-based postcensal estimates for July 1, 2014, for 
the 43 states and District of Columbia that reported mortality data by 
educational attainment using the 2003 version of the U.S. Standard 
Certificate of Death, and for the 4 states that reported using the 1989 
version. 
Previously, population estimates based on CPS were used to 
compute death rates by educational attainment, by marital status and 
for Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central and South American, and 
Other Hispanic populations. Beginning in 2010, population estimates 
based on ACS were used to compute these rates. ACS estimates are 
more statistically reliable and represent the entire U.S. population. 
ACS estimates are based on a 4.5 million person sample of the U.S. 
population, including all households (civilian and military) and the 
institutionalized population (persons living in group quarters). CPS 
estimates are based on an approximate 200,000 person sample of 
only the civilian noninstitutionalized U.S. population. 
Populations used for computing death rates by state, shown in 
Table IX, represent state-level postcensal population estimates based 
on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2014 (12). Rates for Puerto 
Rico are also based on population estimates from the 2010 census 
as of July 1, 2014, and are provided by the Census Bureau (80). Rates 
for Guam, American Samoa, and Northern Marianas are based on 
population estimates provided by the Census Bureau’s International 
Data Base (81). Population estimates for each state and territory are

not subject to sampling variation because the sources used in demo￾graphic analysis are complete counts. 
Rates for 2011–2014 are based on postcensal population esti￾mates consistent with the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1 (9–12). 
Rates for 2010 are based on populations enumerated as of April 1, 
2010 (8). Rates for 2001–2009 shown in this report were revised using 
revised intercensal population estimates based on the 2010 census, 
estimated as of July 1 (13). Death rates for 2000 are based on 
populations enumerated as of April 1, 2000 (82). Rates for 1991–1999 
are based on intercensal population estimates consistent with the 2000 
census levels (83). These estimates were produced under a collab￾orative arrangement with the Census Bureau and are based on the 
2000 census counts by age, race, and sex, modified for consistency 
with 1977 OMB race categories and historical categories for death data 
(53,84). The modification procedures are described in detail elsewhere 
(15,54). The bridged population data are anticipated to be used over 
the next few years for computing population-based rates by race. 
Computing rates
Except for infant mortality rates, rates are on an annual basis 
per 100,000 estimated population residing in the specified area. 
Infant mortality rates are per 1,000 or per 100,000 live births. 
Comparisons made in the text among rates, unless otherwise 
specified, are statistically significant at the 0.05 level of significance. 
Lack of comment in this report about any two rates does not mean 
that the difference was tested and found not to be significant at this 
level. 
Age-adjusted rates (R′) are used to compare relative mortality 
risks among groups and over time. However, they should be viewed 
as relative indexes rather than as actual measures of mortality risk. 
They were computed by the direct method—that is, by applying 
age-specific death rates (Ri
) to the U.S. standard population age 
distribution (Table X), as in 
Psi
R′ = OP Ri s

where Psi is the standard population for age group i and Ps is the 
total U.S. standard population (all ages combined). 
Beginning with the 1999 data year, NCHS adopted a new 
population standard for use in age adjusting death rates. Based on 
the projected year 2000 population of the United States, the new 
standard replaced the 1940 standard population that had been used 
for more than 50 years. The new population standard affects levels 
of mortality and, to some extent, trends and group comparisons. Of 
particular note are the effects on race mortality comparisons. For 
detailed discussion, see the report ‘‘Age Standardization of Death 
Rates: Implementation of the Year 2000 Standard’’ (85). Beginning 
with 2003 data, the traditional standard million population along with 
corresponding standard weights to six decimal places were replaced 
by the projected year 2000 population age distribution (Table X). The 
effect of the change is negligible and does not significantly affect 
comparability with age-adjusted rates calculated using the previous 
method. 
All age-adjusted rates shown in this report are based on the 
2000 U.S. standard population. 
Age-adjusted rates by marital status were computed by 
applying the age-specific death rates to the U.S. standard population 
for those aged 25 and over. Although age-specific death rates by 
marital status are shown for age group 15–24, they are not included 
in the calculation of age-adjusted rates because of their high 
variability, particularly for the widowed population. Age groups 75–84 
and age 85 and over are combined because of high variability in 
death rates for the age group 85 and over, particularly for the 
never-married population. The 2000 standard population used for 
computing age-adjusted rates by marital status is shown in Table XI. 
Age-adjusted rates by educational attainment were computed 
by applying the age-specific death rates to the U.S. standard 
population for those aged 25–64. Data for those aged 65 and over 
are not shown because reporting quality is poorer for older ages

(75). The year 2000 standard population used for computing 
age-adjusted rates by education is shown in Table XII. 
Age-adjusted rates for injury at work were computed by 
applying the age-specific death rates to the U.S. standard population 
for those aged 15 and over. The 2000 standard population used for 
computing age-adjusted rates for injury at work is shown in 
Table XIII. 
Age-adjusted rates for Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, 
and Northern Marianas were computed by applying the age-specific 
death rates to the U.S. standard population. The 2000 standard 
population used for computing age-adjusted rates for the territories 
is shown in Table X. 
Using the same standard population, death rates for the total 
population and for each race-sex group were adjusted separately. 
The age-adjusted rates were based on 10-year age groups. Age￾adjusted death rates are not comparable with crude rates. 
Death rates for the Hispanic population are based only on 
events to persons reported as Hispanic. Hispanic origin is not 
imputed if it is not reported. 
Random variation
The mortality data presented in this report, with the exception of 
data for 1972, are not subject to sampling error. In 1972, mortality 
data were based on a 50% sample of deaths because of resource 
constraints. Mortality data, even based on complete counts, may be 
affected by random variation—that is, the number of deaths that 
actually occurred may be considered as one of a large series of

possible results that could have arisen under the same circum￾stances (86,87). When the number of deaths is small, perhaps fewer 
than 100, random variation tends to be relatively large. Therefore, 
considerable caution must be observed in interpreting statistics 
based on small numbers of deaths. 
Measuring random variability—To quantify the random variation 
associated with mortality statistics, an assumption must be made 
regarding the appropriate underlying distribution. Deaths, as infrequent

events, can be viewed as deriving from a Poisson probability distribution. 
The Poisson distribution is simple conceptually and computationally, and 
provides reasonable, conservative variance estimates for mortality sta￾tistics when the probability of dying is relatively low (86). Using the 
properties of the Poisson distribution, the standard error (SE) associated 
with the number of deaths (D) is 
SE(D) = √var(D) = √D [1] 
where var(D) denotes the variance of D.

The SE associated with crude and age-specific death rates, R, 
assumes that the population denominator, P, is a constant and is 
D D R
SE(R)= Œvar( ) = Œ1 
var(D) = Œ = P P2 P2 √D [2] 
The coefficient of variation or relative standard error (RSE) is a 
useful measure of relative variation. The RSE is calculated by 
dividing the statistic (e.g., number of deaths or death rate) into its SE 
and multiplying by 100. For the number of deaths, 
SE(D) √D
RSE(D) = 100 = 100 D = 100Œ1 
D D
For crude and age-specific death rates, 
SE(R) R/
√D
RSE(R) = 100 = 100 = 100Œ1 
R R D
Thus, 
RSE(D) = RSE(R) = 100 Œ1 
D [3] 
The SE of the age-adjusted death rate R′, is: 
2 2 SE(R′)= Œ∑(P ) var (Ri
) = Œ∑ Psi Ri
Psi
2 {( ) ( )} i s [4] i Ps Di
where
 
Ri = Age-specific rate for the ith age group.
 
Psi = Age-specific standard population for the ith age group from the
 
U.S. standard population age distribution (see Table X and 
Age-adjusted death rate in the following ‘‘Definition of terms’’ 
section). 
Ps = Total U.S. standard population (all ages combined). 
Di = Number of deaths for the ith age group. 
The RSE for the age-adjusted rate, RSE(R≠), is calculated by 
dividing SE(R≠) from Formula 4 by the age-adjusted death rate, R≠, 
and multiplying by 100, as in 
SE(R′) RSE(R′) = 100 R′
For tables showing infant mortality rates based on live births, B, 
in the denominator, calculation of the SE assumes random variability 
in both the numerator and denominator. The SE for the infant 
mortality rate (IMR) is: 
D2 
SE(IMR)= Œvar(D)+ IMR c var(B)
= Œ D
B2 + 
B3 E(B)
2 [5] 
where the number of births, B, is also assumed to be distributed 
according to a Poisson distribution and E(B) is the expectation of B. 
The RSE for the IMR is 
SE(IMR) 1 1 RSE(IMR) = 100 = 100ŒD + IMR B [6] 
Formulas 1–6 may be used for all tables presented in this 
report except for death rates and age-adjusted death rates shown in 
Tables 5, I–7, and I–8, which are calculated using population figures 
that are subject to sampling error. 
Tables 5, I–7, and I–8—Death rates for Mexican, Puerto Rican, 
Cuban, Central and South American, and Other Hispanic populations 
in Table 5, by marital status in Table I–7, and by educational attainment 
in Table I–8 are based on population estimates derived from ACS (73) 
for 2014 and adjusted to resident population control totals. As a result, 
the rates are subject to sampling variability in the denominator as well 
as random variability in the numerator. 
For crude and age-specific death rates, R, the standard error is 
calculated as

where SE(P) in Formulas 7 and 8 represents the SEs of ACS 
population estimates. The SEs of ACS population estimates used in 
this report are presented in Table VI by Mexican, Puerto Rican, 
Cuban, Central and South American, and Other Hispanic popula￾tions; in Table VII by marital status; and in Table VIII by educational 
attainment. 
Suppression of unreliable rates—Beginning with 1989 data, an 
asterisk is shown in place of a crude or age-specific death rate 
based on fewer than 20 deaths, the equivalent of an RSE of 23% or 
more. The limit of 20 deaths is a convenient, if somewhat arbitrary, 
benchmark, below which rates are considered to be too statistically 
unreliable for presentation. For infant mortality rates, the same 
threshold of fewer than 20 deaths is used to determine whether an 
asterisk is presented in place of the rate. For age-adjusted death 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
rates, the suppression criterion is based on the sum of age-specific 
deaths; that is, if the sum of the age-specific deaths is less than 20, 
an asterisk replaces the rate. These procedures are used throughout 
this report except for death rates shown in Tables 5, I–7, and I–8. 
In Tables 5, I–7, and I–8, sampling variability in the population 
denominator has a substantial impact on the overall variability in the 
death rate. Therefore, the number of deaths in the numerator is not 
used as the sole suppression factor. RSEs for rates shown in 
Tables 5, I–7, and I–8 are derived from Formulas 7 and 8 by dividing 
the result of Formula 7 by the crude/age-specific rate, and the result 
of Formula 8 by the age-adjusted rate, and then multiplying by 100. 
Rates are replaced by asterisks if the calculated RSE is 23% or 
more. 
Confidence intervals and statistical tests based on 100 deaths
or more—When the number of deaths is large, a normal approxima￾tion may be used in calculating confidence intervals and statistical 
tests. How large, in terms of number of deaths, is to some extent 
subjective. In general, for crude and age-specific death rates and for 
infant mortality rates, the normal approximation performs well when 
the number of deaths is 100 or greater. For age-adjusted rates, the 
criterion for use of the normal approximation is somewhat more 
complicated (4,85,87). Formula 9 is used to calculate 95% confi￾dence limits for the death rate when the normal approximation is 
appropriate: 
L(R)= R – 1.96(SE(R)) and U(R)= R + 1.96(SE(R)) [9] 
where L(R) and U(R) are the lower and upper limits of the 
confidence interval, respectively. The resulting 95% confidence 
interval can be interpreted to mean that the chances are 95 in 100 
that the ‘‘true’’ death rate falls between L(R) and U(R). For example, 
suppose that the crude death rate for Malignant neoplasms is 186.0 
per 100,000 population based on 565,469 deaths. Lower and upper 
95% confidence limits using Formula 9 are calculated as 
L(186.0) = 186.0 – 1.96(0.25) = 185.5 
and 
U(186.0) = 186.0 + 1.96(0.25) = 186.5 
Thus, the chances are 95 in 100 that the true death rate for 
malignant neoplasms is between 185.5 and 186.5. Formula 9 can 
also be used to calculate 95% confidence intervals for the number of 
deaths, age-adjusted death rates, infant mortality rates, and other 
mortality statistics when the normal approximation is appropriate by 
replacing R with D, R′, IMR, or others. 
When testing the difference between two rates, R1 and R2 (each 
based on 100 or more deaths), the normal approximation may be used 
to calculate a test statistic, z, such that 
R1 – R2 
z = √SE(R1)
2 + SE(R2 )
2 [10] 
If |z| ≥ 1.96, then the difference between the rates is statistically 
significant at the 0.05 level. If |z| < 1.96, then the difference is not 
statistically significant. Formula 10 can also be used to perform tests 
for other mortality statistics when the normal approximation is 
appropriate (i.e., when both statistics being compared meet the 
normal criteria) by replacing R1 and R2 with D1 and D2, R≠1 and R≠2, 
or others. For example, suppose that the male age-adjusted death 
rate for Malignant neoplasms of trachea, bronchus, and lung (lung 
National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 65 No. 4, June 30, 2016 119
cancer) is 65.1 per 100,000 U.S. standard population in the previous 
data year (R1) and 63.6 per 100,000 U.S. standard population in the 
current data year (R2). The SE for each of these figures, SE(R1) and 
SE(R2), is calculated using Formula 4. A test using Formula 10 can 
determine if the decrease in the age-adjusted rate is statistically 
significant: 
65.1 – 63.6 
z = = 4.83 √(0.222)2 + (0.217)2 
Because z = 4.83 > 1.96, the decrease from the previous data year 
to the current data year in the male age-adjusted death rate for lung 
cancer is statistically significant. 
Confidence intervals and statistical tests based on fewer than
100 deaths—When the number of deaths is not large (fewer than 
100), the Poisson distribution cannot be approximated by the normal 
distribution. The normal distribution is symmetrical, with a range from 
–∞ to +∞. As a result, confidence intervals based on the normal 
distribution also have this range. The number of deaths or the death 
rate, however, cannot be less than zero. When the number of deaths 
is very small, approximating confidence intervals for deaths and 
death rates using the normal distribution will sometimes produce 
lower confidence limits that are negative. The Poisson distribution, in 
contrast, is an asymmetric distribution with zero as a lower bound— 
confidence limits based on this distribution will never be less than 
zero. A simple method based on the more general family of gamma 
distributions, of which the Poisson is a member, can be used to 
approximate confidence intervals for deaths and death rates when 
the number of deaths is small (85,87). For more information 
regarding how the gamma method is derived, see ‘‘Derivation of
gamma method’’ at the end of this section. 
Calculations using the gamma method can be made using 
commonly available spreadsheet programs or statistical software 
(e.g., Excel or SAS) that include an inverse gamma function. In 
Excel, the function ‘‘gammainv (probability, alpha, beta)’’ returns 
values associated with the inverse gamma function for a given 
probability between 0 and 1. For 95% confidence limits, the 
probability associated with the lower limit is 0.05/2 = 0.025 and with 
the upper limit, 1 – (0.05/2) = 0.975. Alpha and beta are parameters 
associated with the gamma distribution. For the number of deaths 
and crude and age-specific death rates, alpha = D (the number of 
deaths) and beta = 1. In Excel, the following formulas can be used 
to calculate lower and upper 95% confidence limits for the number of 
deaths and crude and age-specific death rates: 
L(D) = GAMMAINV(0.025, D, 1) 
and 
U(D) = GAMMAINV(0.975, D + 1, 1) 
Confidence limits for the death rate are then calculated by 
dividing L(D) and U(D) by the population (P) at risk of dying (see 
Formula 17). 
Alternatively, 95% confidence limits can be estimated using the 
lower and upper confidence limit factors shown in Table XIV. For the 
number of deaths, D, and the death rate, R, 
L(D)= L x D and U(D)= U x D [11] 
L(R)= L x R and U(R)= U x R [12]

where L and U in both equations are the lower and upper confidence 
limit factors that correspond to the appropriate number of deaths, D, 
in Table XIV. For example, suppose the death rate for AIAN females 
aged 1–4 is 39.5 per 100,000 and based on 50 deaths. Applying 
Formula 12, values for L and U from Table XIV for 50 deaths are 
multiplied by the death rate, 39.5, such that 
L(R) = L(39.5) = 0.742219 x 39.5 = 29.3 
and 
U(R) = U(39.5) = 1.318375 x 39.5 = 52.1 
These confidence limits indicate that the chances are 95 in 100 
that the actual death for AIAN females aged 1–4 is between 29.3 
and 52.1 per 100,000. 
Although the calculations are similar, confidence intervals based 
on small numbers for age-adjusted death rates, infant mortality 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
rates, and rates that are subject to sampling variability in the 
denominator are somewhat more complicated (4,87). 
Refer to the most recent version of the Mortality Technical 
Appendix for more details at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/vsus/ 
ta.htm. 
When comparing the difference between two rates (R1 and R2), 
where one or both are based on fewer than 100 deaths, a 
comparison of 95% confidence intervals may be used as a statistical 
test. If the 95% confidence intervals do not overlap, then the 
difference can be said to be statistically significant at the 0.05 level. 
A simple rule of thumb is: If R1 > R2, then test if L(R1) > U(R2), or if 
R2 > R1, then test if L(R2) > U(R1). Positive tests denote statistical 
significance at the 0.05 level. For example, suppose AIAN females 
aged 1–4 have a death rate (R1) of 39.5 based on 50 deaths and 
API females aged 1–4 have a death rate (R2) of 20.1 per 100,000 
based on 86 deaths. The 95% confidence limits for R1 and R2 
calculated using Formula 12 would be 
L(R1) = L(39.5) = 0.742219 x 39.5 = 29.3 
and 
U(R1) = U(39.5) = 1.318375 x 39.5 = 52.1 
L(R2) = L(20.1) = 0.799871 x 17.9 = 16.1 
and 
U(R2) = U(20.1) = 1.234992 x 17.9 = 24.8 
Because R1 > R2 and L(R1) > U(R2), it can be concluded that 
the difference between the death rates for AIAN females aged 1–4 
and API females of the same age is statistically significant at the 
0.05 level. That is, taking into account random variability, API 
females aged 1–4 have a death rate significantly lower than that for 
AIAN females of the same age. 
This test may also be used to perform tests for other statistics 
when the normal approximation is not appropriate for one or both of 
the statistics being compared, by replacing R1 and R2 with D1 and D2, 
R′1 and R′2, or others. 
Users of the method of comparing confidence intervals should be 
aware that this method is a conservative test for statistical 
significance—the difference between two rates may, in fact, be sta￾tistically significant even though confidence intervals for the two rates 
overlap (88). Caution should be observed when interpreting a non￾significant difference between two rates, especially when the lower and 
upper limits being compared overlap only slightly. 
Derivation of gamma method—For a random variable X that 
follows a gamma distribution Γ(y,z), where y and z are the param￾eters that determine the shape of the distribution (89), 
E(X) = yz and var(X)= yz 2
. For the number of deaths, D, E(D)= D and 
var(D)= D. It follows that y = D and z = 1, and thus, 
D ~ Γ(D,1) [13] 
From Equation 13, it is clear that the shape of the distribution of 
deaths depends only on the number of deaths. 
For the death rate, R, E(R)= R and var(R)= D/P2
. It follows, in 
this case, that y = D and z = P–1, and thus, 
R ~ Γ(D,P–1) [14] 
A useful property of the gamma distribution is that for 
X ~ Γ(y,z), X can be divided by z such that X/z ~ Γ(y,1). This 
National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 65 No. 4, June 30, 2016 121
converts the gamma distribution into a simplified, standard form, 
dependent only on parameter y. Expressing Equation 14 in its 
simplified form gives 
R
P–1 = D ~ Γ(D,1) [15] 
From Equation 15, it is clear that the shape of the distribution of 
the death rate is also dependent solely on the number of deaths. 
Using the results of Equations 13 and 15, the inverse gamma 
distribution can be used to calculate upper and lower confidence limits. 
Lower and upper 100(1 – α) percent confidence limits for the number 
of deaths, L(D) and U(D), are estimated as 
L(D)= Γ–1
(D,1)(α / 2) and U(D)= Γ–1
(D+1,1)(1 – α / 2) [16] 
where Γ–1 represents the inverse of the gamma distribution and D +1 
in the equation for U(D) reflects a continuity correction, which is 
necessary because D is a discrete random variable and the gamma 
distribution is a continuous distribution. For a 95% confidence interval, 
α = 0.05. For the death rate, it can be shown that 
L(D) U(D) L(R)= and U(R) = P P [17] 
For more detail regarding the derivation of the gamma method 
and its application to age-adjusted death rates and other mortality 
statistics, see References (4,87,89). 
Availability of mortality data
Mortality data are available in publications, unpublished tables, 
and electronic products as described on the NCHS mortality website 
at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/deaths.htm. More detailed analysis than

Definition of terms
Age-adjusted death rate—The death rate used to make com￾parisons of relative mortality risks across groups and over time. This 
rate should be viewed as a construct or an index rather than a direct 
or actual measure of mortality risk. Statistically, it is a weighted 
average of age-specific death rates, where the weights represent the 
fixed population proportions by age. 
Age-specific death rate—Deaths per 100,000 population in a 
specified age group, such as 1–4 or 5–9, for a specified period. 
Crude death rate—Total deaths per 100,000 population for a 
specified period. This rate represents the average chance of dying 
during a specified period for persons in the entire population. 
Infant deaths—Deaths of infants under age 1 year. 
Neonatal deaths—Deaths of infants aged 0–27 days. 
Postneonatal deaths—Deaths of infants aged 28 days–11 
months.
