Abstract
Objectives: Non-melanoma skin cancer is the most common malignancy in US, with an 
annual incidence of in excess of 1.5 million cases. In the majority of cases, locoregional 
treatment is curative and systemic therapy is not indicated. Platinum-based chemotherapy 
regimens have been used most commonly in refractory cases. The use of cetuximab, a 
monoclonal antibody targeting epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR], has been reported 
for skin cancer treatment. This current study evaluated eight cases of locally advanced and 
refractory basal cell or squamous cell cancers which were treated with cetuximab. 
Methods: This is a retrospective study on eight patients who had received cetuximab for 
treatment of cutaneous carcinoma since 2007 at Southern Illinois University School of 
Medicine (SIU-SOM) Medical Oncology clinic.
Results: Three of the four patients with basal cell carcinoma and two of the four patients with 
squamous cell carcinoma maintained remission on treatment.. The main side effect was ac￾neiform rash which required termination of treatment for one patient and dose reduction in 
another. 
Conclusion: The study indicates that cetuximab may have a beneficial role for patients with 
non-melanoma cutaneous carcinomas that are refractory to standard therapy.
Key words: cetuximab, non-melanoma, skin cancer
Introduction
As per the United Nations Environment Pro￾gramme (UNEP), global incidence of non-melanoma 
skin cancer exceeds 2 million each year [2]. With a 
10% decrease in stratospheric ozone, this number is 
being expected to increase by 300,000 annually [2].
Seventy-five percent of the non-melanoma skin can￾cers are basal cell carcinomas (BCC), which are usu￾ally effectively treated with excision. The remaining 
are predominantly squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). 
Treatment options for SCC vary depending on the 
severity of the disease, but surgical excision alone is 
generally adequate treatment. However, for high risk 
SCC patients, which include those with inadequately 
excised and recurrent lesions, lymph node metastasis,

and immunosuppression, the current treatment rec￾ommendation is combined surgery and radiation [3].
Patients with high risk cutaneous SCC includes those 
with inadequately excised and recurrent lesions, 
lymph node metastasis, and immunosuppression [3].
At the molecular level, over expression of EGFR is 
considered a predictive factor for identification of 
high-risk SCC [3]. The combination of radiation 
treatment and surgery has reduced the rate of locore￾gional relapse by 20-25% [4]. As per Porceddu et al, 
patients with high-risk pathologic features such as 
multiple nodes, extra nodal spread, positive margins, 
and perineural and vascular invasion will benefit 
from concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy and 
radiation treatment [5]. Platinum-based chemothera￾py regimens have been used most commonly in re￾fractory cases. But, this is frequently a patient popu￾lation with advanced age and multiple co-morbidities, 
in which platinum-based regimens are least tolerated. 
Systemic therapy is recommended only in patients 
with refractory disease. 
Cetuximab is a chimeric human/murine mono￾clonal antibody that binds competitively to EGFR and 
prevents activation of the receptor [6]. Considering 
the low side effect profile, interest in cetuximab as a 
treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer is growing 
area. Compared to currently approved chemothera￾pies for skin carcinomas, it is well tolerated. Most 
adverse skin reactions expected with this treatment 
are cutaneous and include acneiform eruption, xero￾sis, paronychia, hair changes, telangectasia and hy￾perpigmentation. The most common adverse effect is 
acneiform rash which is seen in 50-100% of patients 
[7]. This is assumed to be due to interference with the 
physiological role of EGFR in the epidermis. There are 
reported cases of severe acneiform rash, mucositis 
and dermatitis in people treated with combined radi￾ation and cetuximab [8;9]. There is also one reported 
case of toxic epidermal necrolysis caused by cetuxi￾mab plus minocycline in a patient receiving chemo￾radiation for recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of 
head and neck which evolved in the 5th week of 
treatment with cetuximab [10].
Here, we evaluate eight cases of advanced 
squamous cell carcinoma or basal cell carcinoma pa￾tients treated with cetuximab. Among the eight pa￾tients, four were basal cell carcinoma and four were 
squamous cell carcinoma.
Patients and Methods
A retrospective analysis was performed using 
the records of the SIU-S between the years 2007-2011. 
Local institutional board approval (exempt approval 
on 01/21/2010) was obtained before the beginning of 
the study. Eight patients were identified who had 
received cetuximab for treatment of skin carcinoma. 
Collected from the case records were demographic 
data including age, co-morbidities, and family histo￾ry. Tumor characteristics included histology, stage 
and treatment factors included previous interven￾tions, dose and frequency of cetuximab, and adverse 
effects of cetuximab. Assessment of disease status was 
based on physical examination documented in the 
clinic notes and imaging studies. Complete and par￾tial remission (CR & PR) has been determined based 
on RECIST criteria except the fact that patients may or 
may not been continuing the treatment during that 
time [11]. The follow-up period started from the date 
that treatment was initiated. 
Results
Among the eight patients analyzed, four had 
basal cell carcinoma and four had squamous cell car￾cinoma. The median age of the patient cohort is 79 
(Table 1).

Three of the four patients with BCC had Gorlin 
syndrome with a significant family history of basal 
cell carcinoma. The age group of these patients varied 
from 45-87, including three above the age of 80. All of 
the octogenarians had multiple medical problems and 
required multiple surgeries and excisions of basal cell 
carcinomas that had resulted in deformities in the 
head and neck area. Except for one SCC patient who 
had received Carboplatin and Docetaxel chemother￾apy, none of the other seven patients received any 
prior chemotherapy. The fourth BCC patient, without 
a history of Gorlin Syndrome, had an aggressive basal 
cell carcinoma that warranted numerous resections 
over several years as well as radiation therapy. He 
ultimately developed regional lymph node metastasis 
and was referred for further management of his pro-

gressive disease that was considered refractory to any 
further radiation or surgery. 
Four patients, aged 38 to 89, had recurrent 
squamous cell carcinoma with a history of multiple 
recurrences in the past. Two patients had lymph node 
metastasis. Two patients had a history of renal trans￾plantation and concomitant immunosuppression. One 
was on Mycophenolate and presented with a right 
temple lesion that recurred four times. It was treated 
initially with surgery and combined cetuximab and 
radiation for the second recurrence. The third and 
fourth recurrences were also treated with surgery. 
The other patient presented with a metastatic squa￾mous cell carcinoma of unknown primary with me￾diastinal adenopathy, neck mass and pulmonary 
nodules. He failed Carboplatin/ Docetaxel chemo￾therapy and developed progressive disease with a 
pericardial effusion, necessitating a pericardial win￾dow. He was placed on cetuximab with complete 
clearing of his lesions. He ultimately lost his trans￾planted kidney due to infection. His transplanted 
kidney was surgically removed, and all of his immu￾nosuppression was stopped. 
For five out of the 8 patients, the starting dose of 
cetuximab was 125 mg/m2 once a week. One of the 
patients with BCC received cetuximab 250 mg/m2
once a week, and the latter dose was subsequently 
escalated to 300 mg/m2
. The starting dose of cetuxi￾mab for 2 of the BCC patients was 125 mg /m2 once a 
month. The dose was gradually increased up to 250 
mg/m2 for one of the patients. One of the SCC pa￾tients started with cetuximab 250 mg/m2 once a week 
for eight weeks as induction treatment. The same pa￾tient continued maintenance treatment for two and 
half years as cycles of once a week treatment for four 
weeks with two weeks off.
The adverse reactions observed during therapy 
are outlined in Table 2. Five out of 8 patients (63%) 
experienced grade II acneiform skin rash as a side 
effect, which was usually noted after 2-3 treatments. 
One patient was treated with steroids and minocy￾cline because the rash recurred after each treatment.
Another patient required premature termination of 
cetuximab due to persistent skin rash despite treat￾ment with steroids and minocycline. This latter pa￾tient was subsequently able to tolerate cetuximab with 
a 50% dose reduction when it was restarted for dis￾ease recurrence. For the remaining three patients, the 
grade II skin rash resolved with 2-3 weeks of minocy￾cline treatment. One patient experienced grade II fis￾suring of the skin and improved with topical medica￾tions. This patient later developed grade II skin in￾duration and grade III skin pain after two and half 
years of treatment and stopped therapy. Skin biopsy 
later proved nephrogenic systemic sclerosis. Grade I 
hypomagnesaemia was observed in two patients. 
They were treated with magnesium intravenously 
(IV) with each treatment. 
Among the four patients with BCC, fifty percent 
attained complete remission (CR) and 50% attained 
partial remission (PR) with treatment. Three patients 
relapsed after stopping the treatment (2 CR and 1 PR) 
and currently have been placed back on cetuximab. 
One patient remains on maintenance treatment for the 
last 12 months after attaining an initial partial re￾sponse. Another patient had a local recurrence of the 
disease after a four-month hiatus from treatment and 
now remains on maintenance treatment. The third 
BCC patient had two recurrences after the first treat￾ment with cetuximab, which had to be discontinued 
after four cycles secondary to skin rash. However, 
disease remission had been attained by that time. The 
first recurrence occurred two months after discontin￾uing cetuximab but responded to reinstitution of 
treatment for seven months. The second recurrence 
occurred after five months off therapy, but remission 
was obtained again with the reinitiation of cetuximab, 
and the patient has been on maintenance treatment 
for the last seven months. The fourth patient, who had 
a partial response with cetuximab, had a multifocal 
recurrence soon after being off treatment. He was then 
started on a multidrug chemotherapy regimen with 
5-Flurouracil, carboplatin, and cetuximab. He 
achieved a near complete response to three cycles of 
chemotherapy but therapy was stopped due to his 
advanced age and performance status. His disease 
recurred several months later, and he chose to receive 
supportive care only at that point. The median fol￾low-up for the BCC patients is 12 months. Median 
disease-free survival was 1 month. With a median 
follow up of 12 months, overall survival was 100%. 
Median survival is not yet reached (Table 3).
Three of the four patients with SCC obtained a 
CR. One relapsed at 6 months following active treat￾ment, and the other two have been in remission for 
the past 3 years. The latter two patients had a renal 
transplant and had previously been on Mycopheno￾late or other immunosuppression. The patients had 
been off the immunosuppressant for the past 3 years. 
The patient who had a partial response died second￾ary to other co-morbidities before any further fol￾low-up. Median follow-up and disease- free survival 
were 32.5 months and 20.5 months, respectively. Over 
the 30 months follow up period, the overall survival 
was 75%. Median survival has not been reached (Ta￾ble 3).

Discussions
This study shows that recurrent non-melanoma 
skin cancers can be successfully treated with extended 
cetuximab therapy. 62.5 percent of the study patients 
obtained a complete remission and a major response 
(CR and PR) was achieved in all of the patients.
However, among those whose treatment was held, 
63% of the patients subsequently relapsed. For the 
three patients who had a sustained remission, two 
have continued the maintenance treatment, and the 
other one has stopped. Our median disease-free sur￾vival was only 4 months. Over the 17 months median 
follow up period, the overall survival is 88%. The 
median overall survival has not yet been reached. 
Among the total group, 63% and 25% of patients had 
grade II skin rash and grade 1 hypomagnesemia, re￾spectively. 13% of the patients experienced grade II 
fissuring. The skin induration and skin pain experi￾enced by one patient were considered to be unrelated 
adverse events. No other adverse events were noted, 
and no one developed grade III or IV toxicities with 
treatment. 
Epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] is a 
member of tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor 
family. Activation of this receptor results in intracel￾lular tyrosine kinase autophosphorylation, which ini￾tiates a cascade of intracellular events ultimately
leading to cell cycle progression, angiogenesis, me￾tastasis and reduced apoptosis [12]. EGFR is normally 
expressed in human cells, but higher levels of expres￾sion have been shown in many malignancies. As per 
Krahn, 80% of SCC and 57% of BCC express EGFR 
[13]. As per previous studies, aberration in EGFR 
pathways is associated with poor prognosis in many 
malignancies. Even though BCC also expresses EGFR, 
the key pathology in BCC is an aberration in the 
hedgehog pathway [14;15]. Novel inhibitors of this 
pathway such as GDC-0449 are on trial but are not yet 
clinically approved [16]. It has been shown that EGFR 
signaling acts synergistically with the hedgehog 
pathway in the malignant transformation of cells 
[17;18]. This may explain the effectiveness of cetuxi￾mab in patients with BCC.
We were able to obtain either a CR or a PR for all 
of our patients. However, we had a significant relapse 
rate for patients when treatment was stopped, which 
emphasizes the importance of maintenance treatment 
for long-term disease control. Even though median 
disease free survival was only one month, overall 
survival over the 30 month follow up period was 75%. 
All of these patients had refractory disease, and we 
were able to prolong their life with a relatively low 
toxicity treatment regimen.
Compared to currently approved chemothera￾pies for skin carcinomas, cetuximab is well tolerated. 
In our study, the most commonly experienced side 
effect was acneiform skin rash occurring in 63% of 
patents, which is consistent with a prior study [7]. All 
of skin rashes were grade II in severity, which were 
treated successfully with steroids and minocycline. 
Concurrent radiation treatment increases the inci￾dence of serious adverse events as per the case reports 
that we discussed earlier. Only one of our patients

had received radiation treatment along with cetuxi￾mab treatment, and he subsequently responded to 
single agent cetuximab therapy along with immuno￾suppressant modulation.
There have been isolated case reports of using 
cetuximab in recurrent non-melanoma skin cancers 
with favorable responses [19-22]. However, there 
have been no studies comparing efficacy of treatment 
with cetuximab versus currently approved chemo￾therapeutic agents for cutaneous malignancies. The 
results of the above reported cases are encouraging 
for the use of cetuximab in refractory non-melanoma 
skin cancers and suggest that a randomized phase III 
study between chemotherapy and cetuximab in this 
condition may be useful.
