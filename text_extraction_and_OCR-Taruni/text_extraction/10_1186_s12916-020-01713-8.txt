Abstract
Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by hepatic steatosis in over 5% of the
parenchyma in the absence of excessive alcohol consumption. It is more prevalent in patients with diverse mental
disorders, being part of the comorbidity driving loss of life expectancy and quality of life, yet remains a neglected
entity. NAFLD can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and increases the risk for cirrhosis and hepatic
carcinoma. Both NAFLD and mental disorders share pathophysiological pathways, and also present a complex,
bidirectional relationship with the metabolic syndrome (MetS) and related cardiometabolic diseases.
Main text: This review compares the demographic data on NAFLD and NASH among the global population and
the psychiatric population, finding differences that suggest a higher incidence of this disease among the latter. It
also analyzes the link between NAFLD and psychiatric disorders, looking into common pathophysiological
pathways, such as metabolic, genetic, and lifestyle factors. Finally, possible treatments, tailored approaches, and
future research directions are suggested.
Conclusion: NAFLD is part of a complex system of mental and non-communicable somatic disorders with a
common pathogenesis, based on shared lifestyle and environmental risks, mediated by dysregulation of
inflammation, oxidative stress pathways, and mitochondrial function. The recognition of the prevalent comorbidity
between NAFLD and mental disorders is required to inform clinical practice and develop novel interventions to
prevent and treat these complex and interacting disorders.

Background
Psychiatric patients suffer from a substantial reduction
(ranging between 7 and 20 years) in life expectancy, with
high rates of all-cause mortality [1]. It is estimated that
around 60% of this excess of mortality is due to medical
comorbidities, especially cardiovascular diseases [2]. In
this regard, metabolic syndrome (MetS), defined as the
combination of abdominal obesity, high blood pressure,
low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, elevated triglyc￾erides, and hyperglycemia, plays an important role, since
it is a major risk factor for the development of diabetes
and cardiovascular disease [3]. A significant association
exists between major psychiatric disorders, such as bipo￾lar disorder, depressive disorder or schizophrenia, and
MetS, partly due to psychotropic medication use (e.g.,
atypical antipsychotics) and an unhealthy lifestyle [4]. In
a worldwide survey conducted among more than 47.000
individuals across 17 countries, specific mental disorders
were associated with 1.5–13.3% of physical condition on￾sets [5]. Recently, in a Danish cohort of 5.9 million
people, there was a median hazard ratio of 1.37 of devel￾oping a medical condition if a psychiatric disorder was
present [6].
In this context, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
(NAFLD) is an entity characterized by excessive hepatic
fat accumulation. This is defined as the presence of stea￾tosis in > 5% of hepatocytes according to histological
analysis [7, 8]. It is associated with insulin resistance and it
was considered to be the hepatic manifestation of the MetS.
Recent evidence suggests a complex, bidirectional relation￾ship between NAFLD and cardiometabolic diseases [9].
The distinction of NASH from simple steatosis is key.
Steatosis due to secondary causes, such as viruses, auto￾immune responses, metabolic or hereditary factors, and
drugs or toxins, should be ruled out (Table 1). Classic￾ally, the diagnosis of NAFLD required the exclusion of
alcohol abuse (daily alcohol consumption greater than
30 g for men and 20 g for women) along with secondary
causes for NAFLD (viral pathologies, steatogenic medi￾cations, or other monogenic hereditary disorders).

Decreased appetite, malnutrition, and weight loss are common features in many psychiatric disorders, ranging from eating disorders, loss of appetite, and
secondary weight loss in depression or lack of nutrition in psychotic disorders due to paranoid delusions. Moreover, some patients with severe eating disorders or
severe suicide attempts may require parenteral nutrition. Finally, the prevalence of obesity is higher in patients with psychiatric disorders than in the general
population, with some requiring from bariatric surgery
‡
These agents produce fatty liver or liver inflammation. Valproic acid is a mood stabilizer commonly used in bipolar disorder. Cocaine is highly associated with
psychiatric disorders such as drug use disorders, as well as affective, psychotic, or personality disorders. The use of glucocorticoids may sometimes induce manic
or depressive states. Patients with psychiatric disorders have higher prevalence of HIV and require the use of antivirals for infection control. The association of
fatty liver with amiodarone is strong, whereas its association with valproic acid or calcium-channel blockers is weak. Drug-induced fatty liver may have no
sequelae (e.g., cases caused by glucocorticoids) or can result in cirrhosis (e.g., cases caused by methotrexate and amiodarone)
§
The prevalence of HIV, HCV, and HVB in patients with psychiatric disorders is higher than in the general population. Moreover, some suicidal attempts, although
uncommon, may be due to environmental hepatotoxins, such as organic solvents
Soto-Angona et al. BMC Medicine (2020) 18:261 Page 2 of 14

However, the rising prevalence of NAFLD makes its co￾existence with other chronic liver diseases quite possible.
Therefore, a positive diagnosis rather than a diagnosis
based on exclusion of concomitant diseases has been
proposed [11], and a dual etiology for fatty liver disease
is considered possible and even frequent [12].
Ultrasonography plays a key role in the determination
of steatosis, and a step-by-step approach is preferred
[13]. The precise global incidence of NAFLD is un￾known, due to the complex screening required, wide
variations in the enrollment of differing populations, ra￾cial groups, exclusion criteria for alcohol consumption,
study design, and diagnosis methods [14]. However, its
prevalence is thought to be on the rise, ranging from
20–30% in Western countries to 8–20% in Africa [15,
16]. There are many common medical comorbidities
among NAFLD and most psychiatric disorders, includ￾ing cardiovascular and endocrine-related diseases such
as MetS, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, arterial hyper￾tension, obesity, hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, poly￾cystic ovary syndrome, osteoporosis, obstructive sleep
apnea syndrome (OSAS), chronic kidney disease, psor￾iasis, or cancer [17–20] (Fig. 1). Taking into account its
disease burden and growing prevalence, and the
neglected relationship of NAFLD with MetS and psy￾chiatric disorders, there is a need to better understand
this disease and its commonalities with psychiatric ill￾nesses, in order to develop proper and tailored assess￾ment and test interventions for this prevalent but
neglected comorbidity.
Methods
To gather data on the subject, a search on PubMed with
the terms “([Title/Abstract]NAFLD OR [Title/
Abstract]NASH) AND psych*” was performed. We also
conducted a ScienceDirect search with the terms
“NASH, NAFLD, psychiatry.” A total of 92 results were
obtained, of whom only those pertaining the specific link
of NAFLD, or NASH, and psychiatric disorders, were in￾cluded, leaving a total of 11 publications. The small
number illustrates the sparsity of the literature describ￾ing NAFLD in psychiatry. We also explored secondary
references found in the initial bibliography. A secondary
search of reviews and data on the physiopathology of
NAFLD, and on relevant subjects such as general mor￾bidity of psychiatric disorders, was also performed to
give the reader an overview on the underlying mecha￾nisms of this disease and to explore possible commonal￾ities not yet investigated.
Epidemiology and natural history
NAFLD includes two distinct conditions with different
prognoses: non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and non￾alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NAFL is defined by
steatosis, meaning the presence of lipidic vacuoles in he￾patocytes. NASH involves steatosis plus inflammation,
with signs of hepatic disease, such as ballooning, and
might involve fibrosis [21]. NASH has a higher risk of
cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [22]. NASH car￾ries a high risk of both liver related morbidity and mor￾tality as well as metabolic comorbidities (ten times
higher than the general population), cardiovascular dis￾ease and mortality (twice higher than the general popu￾lation), and cancer (particularly bowel and breast cancer)
[17]. Around 20% of patients suffering from NASH will
develop cirrhosis [16], although it is important to note
that hepatocellular carcinoma can occur in the absence
of cirrhosis [23], making NASH the most rapidly grow￾ing indication for liver transplantation in patients with
hepatocellular carcinoma in the USA [24].
In a recent meta-analysis, the pooled population esti￾mated prevalence of NAFLD was 24–25%, although it
varied across countries. Currently, it is thought to occur
in around 24% in the general population of Europe and
the USA, 27% in Asia, 30% in South America, and 32%
in the Middle East. In Africa, prevalence estimates are
lower, at around 13%. It is worth noting that this data
refers to diagnosis made by imaging, mainly through
ultrasound measuring hepatic fat, as studies using blood
tests (measuring ALT, AST, and platelet count) report
notably lower prevalences [7, 8, 16]. The regional NASH
prevalence estimates among NAFLD patients with an in￾dication for biopsy were around 63% for Asia, 69% for
Europe, and 61% for North America. On the other hand,
NASH prevalence estimates among NAFLD patients
without an indication for biopsy were 7% in Asia and
30% in North America [16].

psychiatric disorders

Both NAFLD and NASH are more prevalent among
males [19]. Gender differences also exist in most psychi￾atric disorders, such as schizophrenia, which is more com￾mon in males, and depression, which is more common in
females [25–27]. On the other hand, racial and ethnic var￾iations exist in NAFLD and NASH; in the USA, the preva￾lence of NAFLD is highest among Hispanic and lowest
among Afro-American populations [28].
While the total prevalence of liver disease in patients
with psychiatric illness is not fully known [29], the
prevalence of MetS in schizophrenic or bipolar patients
is remarkably high, ranging from 22 to 42% [30], com￾pared to non-psychiatric control populations (with an
estimated prevalence of 15–20%). A recent meta-analysis
found patients suffering from severe mental illnesses to
have a pooled RR of 1.58 (1.35–1.86) of developing MetS
[2]. Hence, people suffering from mental health disor￾ders are thought to have an increased incidence of
NAFLD, although data are scant [18]. In this regard, sev￾eral studies and publications have aimed to evaluate its
comorbidity with specific psychiatric disorders.
Most research in NAFLD in psychiatry focuses on
affective disorders. In subjects suffering from NASH,
Elwing et al. observed a higher rate of lifetime major
depression (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorders
(GAD) as compared to the control population. Co￾morbid anxiety in patients is linked to more advanced
liver histological abnormalities [31]. In patients with
NAFLD, there is also evidence pointing for more se￾vere hepatic ballooning when they have MDD [32]. It
is important to note that these studies examined
affective disorders in liver disease patients. The other
way around, examining depressed patients, Weinstein
et al. found higher prevalence rates and severity of
NASH compared to other chronic liver diseases [33].
Two studies among bipolar patients also indicated a
higher prevalence of chart-reported NAFLD and
NASH [34, 35], pointing to risks and mechanisms be￾yond lifestyle or drug use, although no sustained
explanatory theory has yet been suggested. Unhealthy
lifestyle habits are disproportionally present in
affective disorders, where inflammatory and metabolic
disorders are similarly frequently found.
A higher prevalence of NAFLD in schizophrenia is
likely [35, 36]. Yan and colleagues, in a large cross￾sectional study comparing young males with schizophre￾nia with general young males, found a significantly
higher prevalence of NAFLD of up to 49.5% in the study
group compared to 20.1% in the control group. They
found the factors most correlated with NAFLD were tri￾glyceride levels, BMI, medication combinations, drug
dosage, and negative factor scores on the PANSS [37].
Anorexia nervosa is also associated with significant
liver complications, as fasting can lead to steatosis [38].
However, we found no study assessing the specific
prevalence of NAFLD in these patients. Regarding other
psychiatric disorder populations, such as those with anx￾iety, OCD, or PTSD, we are not aware of specific studies
examining the comorbidity with NAFLD/NASH.
Pathophysiology of NAFLD/NASH
NAFLD, diabetes mellitus type 2, and obesity are
thought to share similar risk factors and pathophysio￾logical pathways (Fig. 2). Since the liver is involved in
the majority of metabolic routes, NAFLD can be consid￾ered a consequence of disturbed metabolism, observed
with insulin-resistance and metabolic inflammation [22].
NAFLD develops through the induction of hepatic lipo￾genesis which, in turn, stimulates dysregulated secretion
of proinflammatory cytokines and adipokines; hence,
lipid storage in the liver is increased. A complex inter￾action between genetic, environmental, and epigenetic
factors interplays in the genesis of this disease. Import￾antly, these factors share interesting commonalities with
psychiatric diseases. They are not only important to the
onset of NAFLD, but also to its progression to NASH,
and have an influence in its natural history and severity
[22]. A multiple-hit model has been proposed, implying
multiple insults acting together on genetically predis￾posed subjects to induce NAFLD [39]. Similarly, ex￾planatory models for psychiatric disorders are moving
towards this conception as well [40].
A number of harmful life habits such as a sedentary life
style or an excessive calorie intake have a strong correl￾ation with the development of this disease, as well as an
excess intake of saturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated
omega 6 fatty acids, and industrial fructose [22]. Low
levels of physical activity, and poor diet quality including
increased emotional eating (eating in response to negative
emotions), have been linked to depressive symptoms [41].
However, unhealthy lifestyles and obesity are not the sole
factors in NAFLD genesis, as a relevant percentage (25–
30%) of individuals with obesity might present with a
lower risk of these alterations (the so-called healthy obes￾ity), whereas there is a subset of non-obese individuals
that can suffer from MetS [42]. However, it is relevant to
note that healthy obesity still involves a higher risk of de￾veloping NAFLD than normal weight [43].
In psychiatric patients, the effects of medication also
need to be taken into account, as psychiatric treatments
may have specific side effects on the liver. They also
contribute greatly to weight gain, and the MetS itself
[29]. Moreover, there seems to be an inherent risk of de￾veloping MetS in relation to psychiatric illness that is
also present in non-treated individuals [2]. Diabetes and
insulin resistance have also been associated with an in￾creased risk of depression and anxiety [44]. Recent pub￾lications point to depression as an independent risk
Soto-Angona et al. BMC Medicine (2020) 18:261 Page 4 of 14

factor for obesity [45], and this relationship might be bi￾directional [46, 47]. Alterations in cortisol, which are
more frequent in psychiatric patients, can also promote
insulin resistance, and pro-inflammatory cytokines like
tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 are involved
in depressive disorders and NAFLD/NASH [48].
Common factors
Genetics
Genetic, epidemiological, and twin studies show evi￾dence of moderate heritability of hepatic fat accumula￾tion, ranging from 30 to 70% [49, 50] (Table 2).
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS), candidate
gene studies, and epigenetic studies have so far discov￾ered a few genetic loci and involved proteins that play
an important role in the regulation of lipid metabolism,
inflammation, insulin signaling, oxidative stress, and
fibrogenesis [51].
Among them, patatin-like phospholipase domain￾containing protein 3 (PNPLA3), also known as adiponu￾trin, variation 148M, is the most robust and replicated in
different studies, including GWAS [52] and meta-analysis
[53]. The protein adiponutrin has a hydrolase activity on
triglycerides and retinyl esters. We did not find genetic
studies assessing the potential links between NAFLD and
psychiatric disorders. Kenneson and Funderburck, how￾ever, found individuals with the recessive variant of the
PNPLA3 genotype (MM) had an adjusted odds ratio for
bipolar disorder of about 4.6 compared to individuals with
either the IM or II variants [54]. They proposed an ex￾planation based on the relationship between inflamma￾tion, NAFLD, and bipolar disorder. Adiponutrin is also
expressed in the pituitary, where it appears to be involved
in the regulation of energy homeostasis [55]. In this re￾gard, adiponutrin would play a role in regulating glucose
and fatty acid homeostasis, appetite control, energy
expenditure, and the response to starvation through its
concentration in this gland. There is also evidence of dys￾function of energy regulation and the HPA axis in bipolar
patients, suggesting similar pathways for metabolic dysreg￾ulation [56].
There is also a growing interest in the relationship be￾tween NAFLD and microRNA (miRNAs), which are
short (19–23 nucleotides) non-coding RNA molecules
that regulate messenger RNA degradation or translation,

**Grading for steatohepatitis: grade 1 or mild (macrovesicular steatosis, up to 66% of lobules; occasional ballooning; mainly scattered acute lobular

thereby modulating the expression of entire sets of genes
and pathways [51]. MiRNAs are important for signaling
stress and distress between cells, and these pathways
have been positively linked to NAFLD progression [57,
58] and heritability [59]. A distinct profile of miRNAs
for NAFLD might be useful for its diagnosis [60]. An in￾creasing body of evidence is delving into their role in
psychiatric disorders [61]. Although there are no studies
assessing the specific and common roles of microRNA
in NAFLD and psychiatric disorders, its importance in
terms of inflammation regulation hints to the involve￾ment of common pathways. For example, miR-34a regu￾lates hepatic lipogenesis and lipid secretion, and is
elevated in serum in patients with NAFLD [59]. In bipo￾lar patients, this same miRNA is also elevated, and it has
been hypothesized that it might be an important link be￾tween diverse genetic risk factors and their translation
into the disease, regulating fundamental molecular net￾works for neurodevelopment and synaptogenesis. More￾over, miR-34a concentrations change in response to
treatment, decreasing in response to lithium [61]. How￾ever, it is important to bear in mind that both NAFLD
and psychiatric disorders are complex, polygenic dis￾eases, and these findings only hint to common pathways,
but there is still a lack of adequate powered studies in
this regard.

Mitochondria, inflammation, and oxidative stress
As the site where free fatty acid oxidation takes place,
mitochondria play an important role in protecting
against fatty acid accumulation. Consequently, impair￾ment of their metabolism can lead to an excess of oxida￾tive species that is associated with the development of
NASH [62]. Several mutations in this process have been
linked to NAFLD and NASH [51]. Mitochondria, inflam￾mation, and oxidative stress interplay in a complex man￾ner. Oxidative stress is closely linked to inflammatory
dysregulation, which, as noted before, is a key feature for
the development of NASH from NAFLD and hence
could influence on the severity of the disease [22]. In
fact, patients with steatohepatitis have ultrastructural
mitochondrial lesions, which are absent in most patients
with simple steatosis [62, 63]. This mitochondrial injury
may lead patients with steatohepatitis to slowly resynthe￾size ATP, causing acute hepatic ATP depletion [64].
In parallel, mitochondria, inflammation, and oxidative
stress are also important links in the pathogenesis of
psychiatric disorders, especially mood disorders [65–68].
Current theories propose a model based on neuroin￾flammation and dysregulation of brain energy gener￾ation, involving dysfunction in stress-response
mechanisms [69]. Recent evidence points to mitochon￾dria as one of the main loci for the pathogenesis of bipo￾lar disorder [70]. An increasing number of agents
capable of enhancing antioxidant defenses or mitochon￾drial functioning have recently been studied for the
treatment of mood disorders, which could also be worth
considering as adjuvant therapy to current pharmaco￾logical treatments for NAFLD [71]. Other disorders,
such as PTSD [72], psychosis [73, 74], schizophrenia
[75], depression [76–78], and autism [79], have also been
linked to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysregula￾tion. These alterations not only are linked to the dis￾order pathogenesis itself, but also to progression of the
disorder and poorer outcomes, such as worse cognition
in schizophrenia [80].
Thyroid alterations, known to be involved in the regu￾lation of metabolism and inflammation, have been linked
to psychiatric disorders [81, 82], and also play an im￾portant role in the accumulation of lipid in the liver, po￾tentially driving to NAFLD independently [83, 84].
Microbiota
Gut dysbiosis can contribute to the accumulation of fat
in the liver and the pathogenesis of NAFLD and NASH,
promoting the intestinal absorption of monosaccharides,
and accelerating hepatic lipogenesis [85]. Moreover,
bacteria-derived products can induce inflammation of
adipose tissue, hepatic steatosis, and hepatic inflamma￾tion [86]. This has led to research targeting microbiota
as therapeutic target for these diseases [87], with some
probiotics already in the testing phase [88].
The relationship between microbiota and psychiatric
illnesses is a hot topic [89], as microbiota has been
linked to a wide range of psychiatric disorders, from
ADHD and depression to autism and dementia. The
main theories explaining this relationship point to in￾flammatory dysregulation mediated by bacterial products
[90, 91]. Some probiotics are also being tested as therap￾ies, although the evidence remains scant [92, 93]. How￾ever, we found no study assessing common microbiota
alterations in NAFLD and psychiatric illnesses.
Psychological factors, diet, and exercise
As mentioned, unhealthy lifestyle habits play a central
role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. In this regard, psy￾chological factors that influence these behaviors are key
elements. Stewart et al. [94] found that low conscien￾tiousness and high neuroticism were associated with
weight gain and higher risk of NAFLD, while high phys￾ical activity has been found to exert a protective effect
[95, 96].
The rating of perceived exertion is defined by sensa￾tions of effort, constraints, discomfort, and fatigue felt
by a person when exercising or engaging in physical ac￾tivity and has an influence in maintaining such activity.
Interestingly, in NAFLD, high levels of perceived exer￾tion have been linked to metabolic factors, such as

SUMMARY PANEL
NAFLD = strongly related to MetS
NASH = steatosis + inflammation
NAFLD and NASH are core elements driving metabolic diseases that are
often neglected.
NASH implies a high risk of progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular
carcinoma.
Psychiatric conditions and NAFLD are bidirectionally related.
Rates of NAFLD and NASH in psychiatric patients are high.
60% of the excess mortality in psychiatric patients is due to physical
comorbidities.
Some common factors between psychiatric and metabolic disorders are:
genetic (adiponutrin, microRNA), mitochondrial and oxidative stress
dysregulations, dysbiosis, psychological factors and lifestyle (diet and
exercise).
Possible treatments include changes in lifestyle, insulin sensitizers or
statins.
Diagnosis involves imaging and histology; therefore, widespread
screening is difficult.
Some questionnaires and biological markers are being investigated in
order to make diagnosis easier and less invasive.
Being aware of covert hepatic disorders and achieving an early
diagnosis and adequate treatment could potentially benefit psychiatric
patients in terms of prognosis and quality of life.

syndrome, NASH non-alcoholic steatohepatitis

glucose levels, suggesting an impaired glucose metabol￾ism as a maintenance factor of unhealthy life styles. This
association was not found in other hepatic illnesses, such
as hepatitis C [97].
Poor nutrition is strongly linked to NAFLD. Exces￾sive energy intake, particularly from complex carbohy￾drates, as well as fructose consumption, saturated fats,
and industrialized food products are linked to a dys￾regulated metabolism and to higher risk for the devel￾opment of NAFLD [98]. These same dietary factors
have been linked to poor mental health, as they
influence in several pathways related to psychiatric
disorders, including inflammation, oxidative stress, the
gut microbiome, epigenetic modifications, and neuro￾plasticity [99].
Treatment
The best and most effective treatment for NAFLD and
NASH remains a change in lifestyle, promoting a better
diet, weight loss, and physical activity [7] (Table 3). In
the early stages, a weight loss of 5–8% and a healthy diet
might be sufficient. In a recent systematic review,
NAFLD/NASH was even proposed as a cognitive￾behavioral disease, as lifestyle changes are its most
effective management strategy [100]. However, in more
advanced stages of liver disease, pharmacological treat￾ment, mainly insulin sensitizers, and more aggressive
approaches such as bariatric surgery, might be needed
[86]. Exercise, healthy diet, and weight loss also substan￾tially improve the outcome of several psychiatric
illnesses, improving factors such as cognitive function￾ing, negative symptoms, depression or anxiety, and have
a beneficial impact on common pathways like inflamma￾tory regulation [99, 101].
Among people with psychiatric disorders, even though
having NAFLD does not necessarily mean impairment of
hepatic function, it is important to bear in mind that a
vast number of psychiatric drugs are hepatically metabo￾lized, and their half-life, secondary effects profile, and
metabolism should be accounted for [29]. As noted
Fig. 3 Diagnostic algorithm for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in psychiatric populations.
† Elevated AST/ALT levels should be considered from 1.5 times the upper limit of normal values. However, normal levels do not preclude a
diagnosis of NAFLD.‡ The diagnosis of NAFLD requires the exclusion of alcohol abuse. However, alcohol use is the most common cause of
induced hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis and it should be considered particularly in psychiatric populations. In the case of high alcohol intake, non￾invasive assessments for liver fibrosis (commonly an ultrasound elastography) should be performed.
§ Ultra-sound misses around 20% of steatosis diagnoses. Steatosis may be detected on non-contrast CT, but due to similarity to or lower
sensitivity than ultrasound, exposure to radiation, and potential for misdiagnosis, it is less useful than ultrasound as a screening test. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive modality for the evaluation of hepatic steatosis (with 92%-100% sensitivity, 92%-97% specificity,
and the ability to reliably detect as little as 3% steatosis) but is significantly more costly than ultrasound. None of these imaging modalities can
differentiate NAFLD from NASH, and they have limited ability to discern those patients with advanced fibrosis.
¶ The distinction of NASH from simple steatosis is key. Steatosis due to secondary causes, such as viruses, autoimmune responses, metabolic or
hereditary factors, and drugs or toxins, should be ruled out (Table 1). However, the rising prevalence of NAFLD makes its coexistence with other
chronic liver diseases quite possible. Therefore, a positive diagnosis rather that a diagnosis based on exclusion of concomitant diseases has been
proposed10. Over the last years, the ability to identify NAFLD and to estimate steatofibrosis with ultrasound-based techniques (semi-quantitative,
quantitative, elastographic, and contrast-enhanced) has undergone tremendous progress. However, it is still difficult to capture the inflammatory
component of NASH with ultrasound-assisted techniques112.
* The FIB-4 index is a simple formula based on age, ALT, AST, and platelet count that predicts fibrosis and has been validated in NAFLD and
NASH. However, patients in the indeterminate cut-off values require additional testing to exclude fibrosis.
** Non-invasive imaging–based evaluation for fibrosis primarily relies on measuring elastic shear wave propagation through the liver parenchyma,
with stiffer fibrotic tissue propagating waves faster. The best-validated methods are transient elastography using ultrasound, such as FibroScan,
which has a sensitivity of 85% for detecting advanced fibrosis and 92% for detecting cirrhosis, and magnetic resonance, which provides a
quantitative estimation of liver fat, but it is comparatively expensive, has limited availability, is time-consuming, and requires special software.
*** Liver biopsy, although typically well tolerated, can be painful and can carry morbidity such as bleeding, infection, bile leak, damage to other
organs, and rare mortality risk (<0.01%).

before, some medications are much more associated
with the MetS than others.
Some therapeutic approaches are proposed to target
the metabolic imbalance that underlies NAFLD. They
might also prove beneficial for psychiatric disorders,
based on the common mechanisms mentioned before.
For example, new insulin sensitizers targeting mitochon￾drial pathways are being tested for this purpose. They
could improve the metabolic pathways leading to dia￾betes mellitus type 2, inflammation, and oxidative stress
and hence could be of help in both entities [102]. Some
insulin sensitizers may have value for psychiatric disor￾ders as well, although data remain preliminary [103]. To
target oxidative stress, vitamin E has recently been tested
as a treatment with promising results [104]. Based on
the correlation between poor life style and depressive
symptoms, as mentioned before, antidepressants might
also be considered treatment for NAFLD, although the
potential secondary side effects affecting metabolism of
some agents should be taken into account [105,
106].Statins are also interesting drugs for treating both
NAFLD and psychiatric illnesses. They have a role in
Fig. 4 NAFLD and psychiatric disorders. Bidirectional pathophysiological relations between NAFLD and psychiatric disorders. NAFLD and
psychiatric disorders share many common pathophysiological pathways that point to common underlying mechanisms. NAFLD is part of a
complex system of mental and organic diseases with a common pathogenesis between genetic, environmental, and epigenetic factors based on
dysregulation of inflammation, redox pathways, and mitochondrial biogenesis.

diminishing free cholesterol and have been found to pro￾tect against histological damage [107]. As they have anti￾inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects, they have also
been proposed as adjuvant therapies for a number of
psychiatric disorders [108]. Another interesting example
of common pathways and treatment can be found in the
role of cannabinoid 1 receptor, which modulates the
hepatic energy state and food intake, and could play a
role in the development of hepatic steatosis [109]. The
role of cannabinoid receptors in the development of psy￾chiatric disorders is being widely studied as well, al￾though the evidence remains scant and caution is
advised [110].
Diagnosis
As mentioned before, NAFLD and NASH have a high
prevalence in the general population, but this is even
higher in psychiatric patients. There is a need for NAFLD
and NASH to be taken into account when assessing such
patients, and their specific impact needs to be further in￾vestigated. However, as NAFLD is frequently asymptom￾atic, and is not detected with current psychiatric medical
screening protocols, it is likely grossly underdiagnosed
and disregarded. On the other hand, the current criteria
are based on ruling out other possible causes, whereas,
based on the knowledge on the pathophysiology of the
disease, new nomenclature based on specific causes has
been proposed, aiming for better and more precise defin￾ition and diagnosis [111]. The notion of metabolic
dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) has re￾cently been suggested, involving positive criteria that re￾late to the probable metabolic-inflammation impairment
that underlies this pathology [11].
Diagnosis is currently based on imaging and histology.
A widely used surrogate index, the fatty liver index (FLI)
[112], might be useful in detecting steatosic changes, but
cannot be used for the diagnosis of NASH. To consider
a diagnosis of NAFLD, and refer a person for imaging
(liver ultrasound), the patient should present with
known risk factors, symptoms of fatigue, abdominal
pain, or show an abnormal liver function in the liver
test. NAFLD diagnosis requires either imaging or histo￾logic demonstration of more than 5% hepatic steatosis in
the absence of excessive alcohol consumption. Other
possible causes of steatosis should also be ruled out,
such as hepatitis C infection or hypothyroidism [105]. In
contrast, a NASH diagnosis requires a liver biopsy with
histologic examination, which is not feasible, cost￾effective, or necessary in every patient with NAFLD.
These methods can be invasive and are difficult to im￾plement in the general population for screening pur￾poses. In this regard, recent advances in ultrasonography
techniques might allow for rapid, non-invasive, and cost￾effective alternative methods, and some instruments
such as the ultrasound fatty liver indicator (US-FLI) have
proven to yield a high predictive value for NASH diag￾nosis [113]. Currently, biological markers such as the
FLI are only considered appropriate for large epidemio￾logical studies [11].
There is also a lack of reliable biomarkers [17],
although there are some efforts made in this direction,
based on mechanisms mentioned before, like inflamma￾tory profiles [114] or miRNAs [60], that could help in
aiding an early diagnosis and more closely monitoring
the progression of the disease. Some algorithms based
on non-invasive methods, and aiming for wider screen￾ing, are proposed, as the global awareness of this disease
is increasing [19]. Non-invasive scoring systems can esti￾mate the degree of fibrosis without biopsy, helping to as￾sess the risk of progression to NASH and cirrhosis. The
Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index, incorporating platelet count,
age, AST, and ALT, is the most commonly used and has
been validated for NAFLD and NASH [115, 116].
Some questionnaires are also being validated for moni￾toring impact and progression, like the Liver Disease
Questionnaire [117]. Nevertheless, greater awareness
and suspicion of the disorder in at-risk cohorts should
prompt further investigation. In research, adequate and
standardized measures for non-invasive diagnosis and
measuring of progression should be implemented, in
order to increase the external validity of the results and
enhance our knowledge of the real incidence and preva￾lence of these diseases.
In Fig. 3, we propose a practical diagnostic algorithm
for NAFLD and NASH tailored for psychiatric popula￾tions, based on clinical experience and the American As￾sociation for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)
guidelines [8, 19].
Conclusion
Prevalence studies show higher rates of NAFLD and
NASH among people suffering from psychiatric disorders,
suggesting common risk factors and pathophysiological
links between these entities, with the MetS at their core.
Although few studies have been performed to assess this
relationship, common factors such as genetics, mitochon￾drial dysregulation, and dysbiosis have been found,
strengthening this theory. NAFLD might be part of a com￾plex system of psychiatric and non-communicable medical
disorders with a common pathogenesis based on dysregu￾lation of inflammation, redox pathways, and mitochon￾drial biogenesis (Fig. 4).
There is a knowledge gap that needs to be filled in
order to proper understand the relationship of psychi￾atric illnesses with NAFLD and its impact. Future re￾search should target the common underlying risk factors
and biological pathways. Although some treatments have
been found and seem promising, their compound
Soto-Angona et al. BMC Medicine (2020) 18:261 Page 10 of 14

effectiveness is yet to be evaluated. Also, new and more
efficient screening tools, tailored for psychiatric patients,
who seem to be at a higher risk of suffering this disease,
need to be developed in order to assess the real impact
of this disease. Clinicians should be aware of this entity,
as its presentation might be asymptomatic at onset, but
an early diagnosis could yield benefits in terms of prog￾nosis and quality of life.
