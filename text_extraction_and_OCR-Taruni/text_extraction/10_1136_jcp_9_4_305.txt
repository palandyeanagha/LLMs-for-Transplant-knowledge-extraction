The clinical features of gargoylism are well
known, but there are great gaps in our knowledge
of its chemistry and pathogenesis. The condition
is familial, and because of the widespread lesions
in which there is an abnormal deposit it is gener￾ally thought to be a metabolic disorder. The pre￾cise nature of the material found within the cells,
whether lipoid, carbohydrate, or mixtures of both,
is not yet established. The present-day concep￾tion of the disease has, in fact, been built up from
numerous partially examined cases. A review of
the literature on gargoylism shows that histochemi￾cal studies of necropsy material have not yielded
consistent results. When therefore a case of gar￾goylism was necropsied only five hours after death,
we took the opportunity of investigating the
chemistry of the liver and brain with special refer￾ence to their polysaccharide content.
Case History
A girl was diagnosed as a classical case of gargoyl￾ism when a large umbilical hernia was repaired at the
age of 2 years. She had suffered from a nasal dis￾charge since birth and the nasal bridge was obviously
depressed. On reaching school age she was seen by
a psychiatrist and found to be mentally retarded. At
this time it was noted that there was clouding of the
cornea, a typical gargoyle facies, an enlarged liver,
and a lumbar kyphosis. At the age of 6 years a
" cold" did not clear up and was followed three
weeks later by increasing dyspnoea with periods of
cyanosis. On admission to hospital she was placed
in an oxygen tent and given penicillin but died within
a few hours from the lung infection. Radiographs
taken during life showed many of the stigmata of
gargoylism, including the characteristic hook-shaped
body of the first lumbar vertebra. She was the first
child of healthy young parents with no consanguinity,
and a younger sister, aged 2 years, is apparently
normal and healthy.
Necropsy Findings
The post-mortem examination was made five
hours after death. The body was that of a young
female child showing a depressed bridge of the
nose, prominent supra-orbital ridges, enlarged
lobes of the ears, and a protruding tongue (Fig. 1).
The hands were short and broad. The abdomen
was moderately enlarged and there was an old
transverse umbilical scar.
The serous cavities x-ere healthy. The heart
(150 g.) showed no abnormalities except for slight
thickening of the edges of the mitral and tricuspid
valve cusps. The coronary arteries did not look
thickened. The aorta and main blood vessels were
normal. The tongue was uniformly enlarged and
its surface normal. The teeth were small and
overspaced with a hyperplastic gingivitis. Both
tonsils were enlarged but not inflamed. The larynx
and trachea were normal. There was an acute
bronchitis and bronchiolitis with mucopurulent
exudate. The lungs (left 125 g., right 150 g.)
showed large patches of collapse but no actual
bronchopneumonic consolidation. The spleen
(125 g.) was slightly enlarged, rather pale and soft.
The liver was grossly enlarged (1,090 g.) and its
cut surface had a parboiled appearance. The
mesenteric lymph nodes were swollen and fleshy,
but no abnormal markings were seen on bisection.
The gall-bladder, bile-ducts, and pancreas appeared
to be normal and there were no visible lesions in

the alimentary tract. The kidneys (left 65 g., right
70 g.) were of normal size and architecture. The
ureters, bladder, genitals, and endocrine glands
showed no macroscopic lesions. The spine
showed a kyphosis with a lateral deflection to￾wards the left side at the level of a wedge-shaped
first lumbar vertebra. The skull, which appeared
large, had a small coronal waist just behind the
coronal suture and it was not obviously thinned.
The brain (1,405 g.) was enlarged; the dura mater
and venous sinuses appeared normal, but the lepto￾meninges were opaque over the convexity and
showed patches of recent haemorrhage in the right
frontal region. The convolutional pattern was
normal, but the sulci were rather shallow and
widened; on coronal section the lateral and third
ventricles were seen to be slightly dilated. The
pituitary was of normal size and was removed
with ease from the sella turcica, which was some￾what enlarged.

the brain were fixed in formol alcohol and formol

routine stains for tissues outside the central
nervous system.
Heart - The pericardium and myocardium
appeared normal. The mitral valve showed an
increased amount of collagenous fibrous tissue in
which were many large vacuolated cells with small
irregularly placed nuclei; the associated chordae
tendineae were also involved (Fig. 2). The surface
coronary arteries which were sectioned all showed
concentric thickening of the intima (Fig. 3) by
collagenous tissue in which were numerous large
vacuolated cells; the media was infiltrated by a
few scattered cells similar to those in the intima.
There was no intimal change in the small deep
branches of the coronary arteries, but the peri￾vascular connective tissue of some of them con￾tained a few vacuolated cells. The aorta showed
no change in a section taken from the thoracic
portion.
Liver.-Almost all of the parenchymal cells con￾tained large vacuoles (Fig. 4) and the first impres￾sion was that the spaces were fat, but appropr'ately

Skin, Tongue, Stomach, Pancreas, and Ovary.-
Occasional isolated large vacuoles were seen in
sections of these tissues, but we were not confident
in considering them abnormal.
4
Bone.-In the ribs and vertebral bodies the
~~~~~~~~~~~striking change was found in the periosteum. This
was thickened and contained numerous large
vacuolated cells (Fig. 6). The formation of bone 3 from cartilage was abnormal in that there was no
arrangement of cartilage columns at the growth
line; internally, however, the bony trabeculae ap￾peared normal and the marrow showed no vacuo￾lated cells.
Eye.-The left eye was examined histologically. !05!~~~~~~~~There was a calcified cataract and a vascularized
cornea. The corneal epithelium was normal and
no abnormal cells were seen in the thin layer of
fibrous tissue beneath it or in the adjoining capil￾lary layer.

acid-Schiff methods, performic acid-Schiff methods,
Nile-blue sulphate, Best's carmine stain, Congo

PATHOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY OF A CASE OF GARGOYLISM
evidently been removed by solution in both the
formol and absolute alcohol fixatives.
Brain.-Celloidin and frozen sections were pre￾pared from representative areas of the cerebral
cortex, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and brain-stem.
They were stained by standard methods for nerve
cells, axis cylinders, myelin, neuroglia, and lipoid.
Leptomeninges.-These showed fibrous thicken￾ing about 1 mm. deep in the fronto-parietal region.
No macrophage cells were seen.
Cerebral Cortex. -Here the most striking
feature was the swelling of most of the large
neurons. These had become spherical or pear￾shaped and the Nissl substance had disappeared
leaving a fine granularity or reticulation in the dis￾tended cytoplasm (Fig. 7). The nuclei had been
pushed to the margin of the cell, usually towards
the base of the apical dendrite. The neurofibrils
had also been displaced to the periphery where in
larger nerve cells they formed a thin marginal rind
(Fig. 8). These cells contained abnormal granules
which stained a bright orange with Jackson's
acetic-carbol Sudan III. The substance was not
birefringent. This accumulation of granular
material, though most obvious in the larger
neurons of the third and fifth layers, was virtually
ubiquitous. The impression gained by a study of
large celloidin sections was that the occipital lobe
was the least affected region. Most of the large
cells of Meynert of the calcarine cortex were, how￾ever, unaltered. The giant Betz cells of the pre￾central gyrus, on the other hand, showed a very
variable degree of involvement which ranged from
the inclusion of a few granules to almost com￾plete filling of the cell body. The small nerve cells
of the fourth cortical layer and also those of the
fascia dentata were only slightly swollen.
The myelination of the grey matter was gener￾ally poor, the radial bundles being sparse and the
stria of Gennari and other tangential fibre systems
poorly defined even in frozen sections.
The astrocytes of the molecular layer were in￾creased in numbers and numerous small perivascu￾lar aggregations of fibrous astrocytes were present
throughout the grey matter (Fig. 9). The cell
bodies of the macroglia did not contain any of
the granular substance found in the nerve cells
and the microglia was inactive; there was no in￾crease in oligodendroglial satellites.
Subcortical White Matter.-The central cores of
the gyri and the centum semiovale were well
myelinated and there was no evidence of recent
breakdown of myelin; nevertheless, a generalized
fibrillary gliosis was revealed in the Holzer pre￾FIG. 10.-A gyrus showing numerous perivascular lacunae in th

parations. The perivascular spaces in the white
matter were often greatly enlarged (Fig. 10) and
filled with a cellular reticulum composed mainly
of collagen fibres continuous with the adventitial
sheath of the vessel. There was also an admixture
of astrocytes and their fibrils. Here and there the
perivascular lacunae contained aggregations of
compound granular corpuscles (Fig. 11) and these
cells were also seen around vessels with no obvious
enlargement of the perivascular space. These
microglial phagocytes contained neutral fat and a
few doubly refractile particles but never the rela￾tively insoluble substance of the nerve cells (vide
infra). The marginal white matter was not demye￾inated, nor was there any intensification of gliosis
except for what might be accounted for by shrink￾age during processing.
Basal Ganglia.-The nerve cells of the thalami
contained large amounts of the abnormal granular
material, and in both dorso-medial nuclei there
were extensive areas from which the nerve cells
had disappeared and in which a heavy fibrillary
gliosis was present. The myelinated fibres in these
areas were reduced in number and often showed
pale-staining fusiform beadings while compound
granular corpuscles containing neutral fat ringed
many of the neighbouring vessels. In the glohus
pallidus of each side the nerve cells contained

a variable amount of the granular lipoid substance;
myelination, however, was normal and there was
no gliosis.
In the putamina and caudate nuclei conspicuous
differences were seen between the degree of in￾volvement of the large and small nerve cells, the
former being greatly swollen and stuffed with
lipoid while the latter were only slightly enlarged
(Fig. 12). The claustra showed only minimal
changes while the amygdaloid and nucleus basalis
were grossly affected.
Midbrain, Pons, and Medulla.-Similar discrep￾ancies in regional involvement were seen in these
areas. In general the large motor neurons were
severely affected, those of the substantia nigra, the
motor nucleus of the fifth cranial nerve and the
hypoglossal nucleus being greatly distended with
lipoid granules, while the red nucleus, nuclei pontis,
and inferior olivary cells showed little or no abnor￾mality. The pyramidal tracts were normally mye￾linated but somewhat smaller in cross-section than
those of a normal child of 6 years of age.
Cerebellum.-There was no apparent loss of
Purkinje cells, and although virtually all contained
lipoid few were conspicuously enlarged. Large
oval lipoid-laden swellings of the Purkinje den￾drites were commonly seen in the molecular layer

of the vermis and less frequently in the cerebellar
hemispheres (Fig. 13). No axonal torpedoes were
present in the granular layer. The nerve cells of
the granular layer appeared unchanged and those
of the dentate nuclei were only minimally affected.
Myelination of the cerebellum was within normal
limits, but the whole of the white matter, as in the
cerebral hemispheres, was moderately gliosed and
showed a localized intensification in the hila and

periphery of the dentate nuclei. In the molecular
layer a mild overgrowth of the fibrils of the Berg￾mann glia had taken place.
Choroid Plexus.-The epithelial cells of the
choroid plexus contained lipoid granules in finely
dispersed form.
Staining Reactions of Intracellular Lipoid
Deposit in the Brain.-The deposit stained pale
yellow with Scharlach R, bright orange with
Jackson's acetic-carbol Sudan III, blue with Nile
blue sulphate, grey with Sudan black B, and pink
with Feyrter's thionin. The periodic-acid-Schiff
method was strongly positive, the reaction being
prevented by acetylation and restored by potassium
hydroxide. A greyish-black colour was produced
by the Kultschitsky-Pal stain after six days' mor￾danting and also by the Heidenhain myelin stain
on ordinary celloidin sections. The granules did
not colour with mucicarmine or with Best's stain
for glycogen.
Solubility was tested by immersing frozen sec￾tions in a variety of solvents at a temperature of
600 C. for periods up to a week's duration. The
staining by P.A.S. and Feyrter's methods was nega￾tive after sections had been exposed to strong
lipoid solvents (chloroform, pyridine, chloroform￾methanol) for 18 hours at 600 C.; acetone or ether
alone did not have this effect. However, after
treatment with these strong solvents the granular
deposits in the nerve cells still gave a bright orange
colour with Jackson's Sudan III. The same results
were obtained after thin blocks of tissue had been
boiled in a chloroform-methanol mixture for 12
hours in a Soxhlet apparatus and then embedded
in paraffin.
Chemistry
Liver.-The polysaccharide content of the gar￾goyle liver was compared with that of a healthy
girl aged 8 years who had died from an accident
and was necropsied six hours after death. A large
excess of polysaccharide was present in the gar￾goyle liver and a series of highly complex muco￾polysaccharides was isolated, the most significant
one being a heparin-like polysaccharide (see
Appendix).

A lipoid analysis of the gargoyle liver (Table I)
showed no increase in cerebroside as compared
with the normal. There was, however, a marked
decrease in the phosphatide fraction.
Brain.-The grey matter was subjected to the
same process of extraction as the liver. Both the
gargoyle brain and a control gave small amounts
of similar neutral and acidic polysaccharide frac￾tions and on hydrolysis these fractions produced
seemingly identical components. It was not pos￾sible to carry out quantitative comparisons on the
small amounts of extracted polysaccharides. The
heparin-like polysaccharide in the gargoyle liver
was not found in either brain.
An analysis of the lipoid content of the brain
showed no increase in the cerebrosides or other
components above the normal levels (Table II).
The ganglioside content of the gargoyle cortex as
assessed by the estimation of hexosamine was
1.64% dry basis against our control figures of
1.27% (9 months) and 1.45% (65 years). Ganglio￾side as assessed neuraminic acid also showed no
increase.

Discussion
The outstanding feature in this case of gar￾goylism is the complete removal of the infiltrating
material by formalin and by alcohol fixat:on from
all tissues excepting the brain. The material must
be very soluble in these fixatives ; its disappearance
cannot be accounted for by post-mortem autolysis
because chemical extraction showed a threefold
increase in the amount of polysaccharides in the
liver. The polysaccharides extracted from the
liver were insoluble in 95% ethanol, and it seems
therefore that the material which dissolved out
during fixation must have been a soluble poly￾saccharide complex.
Strauss (1948), Dawson (1954), and others have
failed to stain the liver infiltrate in post-mortem
material. Nisbet and Cupit (1954), on the other
hand, were able to stain most of the liver infiltrate
in alcohol-fixed material. Best's carmine stain
showed much red-staining material, but it did not

account for the whole of the infiltrate. Much
more material stained positively with the periodic￾acid-Schiff method, and they suggested that the
liver infiltrate consists of at least two abnormal
substances of carbohydrate nature.
Lindsay, Reilly, Gotham, and Skahen (1948),
although unable to stain post-mortem material,
were able to stain the infiltrate in fresh biopsy
material. In one case the infiltrate in cartilage
stained with Best's carmine stain and in another
case positive staining of liver and cartilage
biopsies was obtained by the Feulgen-Bauer
method. Henderson, Macgregor, Thannhauser,
and Holden (1952), however, failed to stain the
abnormal deposit in liver biopsy material from
two cases of gargoylism.
In spite of the great difficulty in staining the
infiltrate outside the nervous system it appears that
those who have had partial success with either
biopsy or post-mortem material believe it to be a
carbohydrate. Their opinions, based on histo￾chemical findings, are confirmed by the results of
our chemical extraction of the liver. Furthermore,
the chemical studies show that the liver disorder
is not simply the deposition of a particular carbo￾hydrate but that normal glycogen storage is re￾placed by an accumulation of many complex poly￾saccharides. It is therefore not surprising that the
histochemical results obtained with different stains
should be variable. We believe it is to be expected
that mucopolysaccharides like the " heparin-type "
isolated from the liver may show little or no re￾action to periodate. The reaction of complex poly￾saccharides with the periodic-acid-Schiff staining
technique is smaller than that of simple poly￾saccharides because groups such as sulphate and
N-acetamide prevent the periodate attack. Thus,
heparin shows only 25% of the reaction of gly￾cogen. With our " heparin-type " polysaccharide,
which we know contains sulphate and substituted
amino groups, the reaction will be certainly much
less than glycogen and it is quite conceivable that
it would not react at all, especially if it is involved
in complex formation in the tissue itself. It would
be perhaps best to use dyes such as toluidine blue
for staining " heparin-type " polysaccharides, sinc
it is known that these are strongly absorbed on
such polysaccharides.
The widespread lesions of gargoylism are listed
by Henderson et al. (1952), and their excellent re￾view of the literature shows that there is much
variation in the distribution and severity of the
lesions, although the brain, liver, and spleen are
invariably affected. In our case the striking differ￾ences in involvement of the spleen, tonsil, and
lymph node exemplify the capricious and inex￾plicable distribution of the infiltrate.
The thickening of the leptomeninges in gargoyl￾ism has had little attention though there have been
occasional references to the opacity of the pia￾arachnoid on naked-eye examination. Where
marked fibrosis has been found, as in the cases of
Green (1948), Russell (1949, Magee (1950), and
Dawson (1954), internal hydrocephalus has also
been present. In this case the thickening was much
greater over the convexity than at the base, and
the lateral ventricles were only slightly dilated.
Russell has suggested that the meningeal fibrosis
in gargoylism follows a low-grade inflammatory
reaction set up by lipoid deposition and that the
hydrocephalus is the result of partial obstruction to
the subarachnoid space. In her case granular
material similar in staining properties to that of
the neurons was found in the arachnoid cells.
Tuthill (1934) recorded similar swelling of the con￾nective tissue cells and the presence of conglomer￾ate masses of lipoid particles in the thickened
meninges. The collagenous proliferation of the
pia-arachnoid described by Magee reached the ex￾traordinary depth of half a centimetre and com￾pletely obscured the convolutional pattern of the
underlying brain. In his case the numerous
macrophages enmeshed in the fibrous tissue con￾tained both neutral fat and an unidentified
material which coloured poorly or not at all with
lipoid stains. In Magee's opinion the meningeal
changes represented an extension of the general￾ized abnormalities of connective tissue found else￾where in the body. The meninges in Green's
(1948) case were also thickened and contained
scattered compound granular corpuscles and
macrophages; but Strauss, who had reported on the
general pathology, attributed the hydrocephalus to
a bony deformity of the base of the skull and cited
other examples of gargoylism showing this feature.
In one of these, Nja's (1946) case, the chief bony
protuberance was of the orbital plates, and it is
not easy to understand how dilatation of the
ventricles could be attributed to this factor alone.
There can be little doubt that partial obstruction
of the subarachnoid space by fibrosis remains the
most likely cause of the hydrocephalus as distinct
from the abnormal contour of the head. In our
case the large brain was evidently not the direct
consequence of hydrocephalus.
The pathological alterations of the nerve cells
caused by the storage in the cytons of an abnormal
granular substance did not differ materially from
what has been described by others. There was

PATHOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY OF A CASE OF GARGOYLISM
means uniform, involvement of the cerebral cortex.
The literature contains many references to reduc￾tion in the number of nerve cells of the cortex and
other regions, but in our case the only certain in￾stance of this was seen in the areas of substantial
neuronal loss in the medial thalamic nuclei. There
were striking local variations in the degree of affec￾tion of certain cell groups. In the corpus striatum
the gross distension of the large nerve cells of the
putamen and caudate nucleus was in marked con￾trast to the minimal swelling of the smaller ele￾ments. Similarly, in the brain-stem the larger
motor neurons were often greatly altered while
the inferior olives and nucleus pontis appeared
almost normal. Until more detailed records are
available one cannot say whether such regional
variations are mere individual peculiarities or are
characteristic of the disease process itself.
In the cerebellum we were able to confirm
Jervis's (1950) and Dawson's findings of large
ovoid expansions of the dendrites of the Purkinje
cells. These swellings were filled with granules
similar to those of the nerve cell bodies. In this,
as in other respects, there is a close resemblance
to the lesions seen in the amaurotic family idiocy
group, although the especially severe atrophy of
the granular layer of the cerebellum sometimes
found in the juvenile type has yet to be reported
in a gargoyle.
The enlarged, almost cyst-like, perivascular
spaces seen in the cerebral white matter are one
of the lesser-known pathological findings in gar￾goylism. They were first reported by Tuthill, who
regarded them as the consequence of adventitial
hypertrophy, and they have recently been the sub￾ject of special consideration by Naidoo (1953).
Perivascular cyst formation has also been described
by Scheinker (1947) in the white matter of epileptic
brains and was attributed by him to tissue break￾down following functional circulatory disturb￾ances. Perhaps the similarly dilated perivascular
spaces recently reported by Crome (1954) in a case
of tuberose sclerosis originated in this way. How￾ever, epilepsy is almost unknown in gargoylism,
and in our case there was no perivascular gliosis
or demyelination. Moreover, no space contained
more than a few cells containing fat granules
whereas in many there was a marked collagenous
overgrowth. Tuthill's theory of adventitial hyper￾trophy therefore seems plausible and has the
further advantage of linking the perivascular
changes with the fibrosis of the leptomeninges.
The histochemical findings in our case corre￾spond well with what Dawson reported; the nerve
cells contained a P.A.S.-positive substance extract￾able by the more powerful lipoid solvents. It
cannot, however, be maintained that these histo￾chemical findings are peculiar to the gargoyle
brain, since we have obtained identical results
with the brains of two juvenile amaurotic idiots.
Furthermore, since the total cerebroside and
ganglioside content of the gargoyle brain was not
significantly raised, the abnormality of lipoid
metabolism must presumably be one of redistri￾bution of the lipoid fractions rather than a simple
excess storage in this case.
Dawson suggested that the primary disturbance
in gargoylism is one of polysaccharide or muco￾polysaccharide metabolism and that in the nervous
system polysaccharides and the phosphatides or
cerebrosides combine, producing compounds of
varying solubility. A distinction may certainly be
drawn between the rapidly diffusible substance in
the liver and the relatively insoluble material which
is present in the nerve cells and resembles a cere￾broside. Brante (1951, 1952) showed that the
infiltrate in neurones had the properties of a
ganglioside (gangliosides have cerebroside and
polysaccharide components). In the other tissues,
Brante found much diffusible material with the
properties of a mucopolysaccharide.
The chemical analysis of the gargoyle liver
showed a quantitative increase in mucopolysac￾charides. In the gargoyle and control brains the
amounts of polysaccharide complexes extracted
were insufficient for an adequate quantitative
assessment. However, the important point emerges
that the heparin-type polysaccharide extracted from
the liver was not found amongst the brain poly￾saccharides. It is also interesting to mention that
a similar investigation of the spleen from this gar￾goyle showed the heparin-type polysaccharide to
be definitely absent.
Summary
The pathological findings in a case of gargoylism
are described with a detailed chemical investiga￾tion of the liver and brain. There was evidence
that the normal glycogen in the liver was deficient
and had been replaced by the accumulation of a
series of highly complex mucopolysaccharides. An
unusual heparin-like polysaccharide in the gar￾goyle liver was not found in either the brain or
spleen. This polysaccharide is not likely to stain
well, if at all, by the periodic-acid-Schiff technique
but should stain strongly with toluidine blue.
Although the nerve cells contained abnormal
granules of a P.A.S.-positive substance, chemical
analysis of the brain showed no significant
increase in the cerebroside or ganglioside content.

APPENDIX
CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF TISSUE
POLYSACCHARIDES
BY
M. STACEY AND S. A. BARKER
From the Chemistry Department, University of
Birmingham
We have compared the polysaccharide contents of the
livers of two young subjects, one with gargoylism and
the other a child who had died 12 hours after an acci￾dent. In both cases the enzyme action in these tissues
was arrested by freezing before glycogenolysis could
have been completed, and crude polysaccharide mix￾tures were isolated by identical procedures involving
(a) hot water extraction following prior removal of
fats and colouring matter with acetone and chloro￾form, and (b) alkaline extraction of the residue,
neutralization with glacial acetic acid, removal of the
precipitate, and isolation of the crude polysaccharide
in the supernatant. A solid wax was obtained from
the acetone/chloroform extract of the gargoyle liver.
The bulk of the protein was removed from the crude
polysaccharides by chloroform /butanol treatment.
The amounts of crude polysaccharides isolated from
the " gargoylism " liver (approximately 7 g. from
220 g. of wet tissue) were surprisingly three times
those from a corresponding weight of the " accident"
liver.
To separate these polysaccharide mixtures a novel
scheme was devised in which the key reagent em￾ployed (Jones, 1953 ; Dutta, Jones, and Stacey, 1953)
was "cetavlon" (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide).
This precipitates sulphated polysaccharides such as
heparin, mucoitin sulphate, chondroitin sulphate, and
dextran sulphate, but not "neutral" polysaccharides
such as glycogen, blood group polysaccharides and
dextran.
The water-extracted " gargoylism " polysaccharide
(S, 3.95%) contained a larger proportion of " cetav￾lon" precipitable polysaccharide (from 33-50%) than
that (ca 20%) of the corresponding " accident " poly￾saccharide (S, 0.57%). Both " cetavlon "-precipitated
fractions showed strong infra-red absorption at 1,230-
55 cm.-' indicating that they were sulphated, but their
spectra in the region 720-1,000 cm.-' were very differ￾ent. The gargoylism fraction, whose infra-red spec￾trum showed most but not all the features of that of
heparin, was refractionated with " cetavlon," the pre￾cipitated fraction (S, 7.68%) having [ca]17+ 18.10
(water) and the soluble fraction (S, 6.26%) [a]17 + 37.20
(water). Although both these latter fractions when
hydrolysed showed, after ionophoresis in borate buffer
pH 10, a component inter alia whose Mg value and
colour with aniline hydrogen phthalate were identical
with the main hydrolysis product (believed to be the
heparosin-sulphuric acid of Wolfrom, Montgomery,
Karabinos, and Rathgeb, 1950) of heparin, they showed
only a slight but definite blood anticoagulant activity
(" cetavlon "-precipitated fraction, 1.1 %, and " cetav￾lon" soluble, 0.56%, of the activity of international
standard heparin).
The " neutral " polysaccharides which were not pre￾cipitated by the "cetavlon " treatment of the water￾extracted liver polysaccharides could be further frac￾tionated using 85% acetic acid, any glycogen present
being precipitated under these conditions. Pure gly￾cogen (which had [a]2O +197°; stained red with
iodine, was attacked by glucamylase, fl-amylase, and
a-amylase, gave only glucose after acid hydrolysis;
was free from sulphate and contained no N-acetyl or
carboxylic acid groups) could be isolated in an overall
yield of 8.3% of the crude water-extracted " accident "
polysaccharide mixture. On the other hand, less than
0.3% [4 mg. from 1.638 g.] of a crude glycogen frac￾tion (which had [a] 17+ 115°; stained red with iodine;
was attacked by a-amylase; gave glucose as the main
component after acid hydrolysis with traces of galac￾tose, glucuronic acid, and glucosamine; was free from
sulphate) could be obtained from the corresponding
" gargoylism " liver polysaccharide. This observation
was confirmed in our laboratories by Professor M.
Heidelberger, who showed that, whereas the crude
water-extracted " accident " polysaccharide gave large
precipitates with anti-pneumococcus sera of types II
and XII, no observable reaction was obtained with the
corresponding " gargoylism" liver polysaccharide.
However, both the pure " accident " glycogen and the
crude "gargoylism " glycogen reacted strongly with
type XII anti-serum. Glycogens from many sources
are known (Heidelberger, Aisenberg, Cori, Hassid, and
Pacsu, 1953) to give specific precipitates in the cold
with antibodies in the horse to the pneumococcal
types II and XII. Serological tests also confirmed the
absence of glycogen from the " cetavlon "-precipitated
fractions.

PATHOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY OF A CASE OF GARGOYLISM
At least two other polysaccharides accompanied the
trace of glycogen in the soluble fraction after " cetav￾Ion " treatment of the water-extracted " gargoylism "
polysaccharide. One of these was precipitated together
with the glycogen by 85% glacial acetic acid and could
be largely separated from it by alcohol fractionation,
the glycogen being precipitated with one volume of
ethanol and this polysaccharide, " A," with four
volumes of ethanol. Polysaccharide A (overall yield,
1.4%) had [a]17+58.70 (c, 0.264 in water) and when
hydrolysed showed galactose (ca 3 parts) and glucose
(ca 1 part) as its main components together with small
amounts of glucosamine and glucuronic acid. Other
ninhydrin-reacting components (probably amino-acids)
were detected. The other polysaccharide, B (overall
yield, 13.5%), had [a]17+7.50 (c, 0.47 in water), and
when hydrolysed showed inter al;a glucose, galactose,
glucosamine, and a trace of glucuronic acid, together
with amino-acids (including glutamic acid, aspartic
acid). Although the crude water-extracted "gargoyl￾ism" polysaccharide showed an almost negligible re￾action with anti-serum of pneumococcus type XIV,
polysaccharide A gave a weak reaction and polysac￾charide B a strong reaction. It appears therefore that
polysaccharide B, in particular, must bear a strong
resemblance to the type XIV specific polysaccharide
(shown to contain glucose, galactose and glucosamine,
Barker, Heidelberger, and Stacey, unpublished re￾sults) and to the blood group polysaccharides which
also react with type XIV anti-serum (Kabat, Bendich,
Bezer, and Knaub, 1948). Both polysaccharides A and
B showed infra-red absorption at 1,648 and 1,550 cm.-'
attributable to a R-N-C grouping (including N￾11
H O
acetyl) and only very weak absorption at 1,235-55
cm.-' indicating that it contained few, if any, sulphate
groups.
It will be seen that a profound carbohydrate meta￾bolic upset has taken place in the gargoyle liver knock￾ing out the normal glycogen storage and building up
a series of highly complex mucopolysaccharides.
Another mixture, from which the heparin-like poly￾saccharide was significantly absent, has been isolated
from the spleen in this case, and this is now under
investigation.
The authors wish to express their thanks to Professor
M. Heidelberger for performing the serological tests
and to Dr. C. R. Ricketts for carrying out the anti￾coagulant activities.
