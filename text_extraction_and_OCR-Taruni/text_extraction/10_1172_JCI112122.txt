Abstract
Postischemic acute renal failure (ARF) induced by cardiac sur￾gery is commonly prolonged and may be irreversible. To examine
whether persistence of postischemic, tubular cell injury accounts
for delayed recovery from ARF, we studied 10 patients developing
protracted (36±4 d) ARF after cardiac surgery. The differential
clearance and excretion dynamics of probe solutes of graded size
were determined. Inulin clearance was depressed (5.0±1.7 ml/
min), while the fractional urinary clearance of dextrans (radii
17-30 A) were elevated above unity. Employing a model of con￾servation of mass, we calculated that 44% of filtered inulin was
lost via transtubular backleak. The clearance and fractional
backleak of technetium-labeled DTPA (Ir"TcIDTPA, radius
= 4 A) were identical to those of inulin (radius 15 A). The time
at which inulin or DTPA excretion reached a maximum after an
intravenous bolus injection was markedly delayed when compared
with control subjects with ARF of brief duration, 102 vs. 11 min.
Applying a three-compartment model of inulin/DTPA kinetics
(which takes backleak into account) revealed the residence time
of intravenously administered inulin/DTPA in the compartment
occupied by tubular fluid and urine to be markedly prolonged,
20 vs. 6 min in controls, suggesting reduced velocity of tubular
fluid flow. We conclude that protracted human ARF is charac￾terized by transtubular backleak of glomerular ultrafiltrate, such
that inulin clearance underestimates true glomerular filtration
rate by -50%, and by sluggish tubular fluid flow, which strongly
suggests the existence of severe and generalized intraluminal
tubular obstruction. Because all patients also exhibited extreme
hyperreninemia (16±2 ng/ml per h) that was inversely related
to inulin clearance (r value = -0.83) and urine flow (r value
= -0.70), we propose that persistent, angiotensin II-mediated
renal vasoconstriction may have delayed healing of the injured
tubular epithelium.
Introduction
A reversible form of acute renal excretory failure has long been
known to occur in man in the wake of an episode of transient
circulatory failure. Formerly, this postischemic renal injury was
characterized by an initial period of oliguria which persisted in
the typical case for 7-10 d. Thereafter, a diuretic phase ensued
that heralded the onset of a gradual recovery from azotemia
over the subsequent 7-10 d (1, 2). This acute renal injury has
been accurately simulated in experimental animals by transiently
interrupting renal blood flow for 40-60 min. Micropuncture

studies have revealed that the oliguric phase of postischemic,
acute renal failure (ARF)' is caused in large part by intraluminal
tubular obstruction accompanied by backleak ofa large fraction
of glomerular filtrate across a necrotic tubular wall (3-7). As in
the human injury, recovery from postischemic ARF in the rat
typically begins during the second week after the ischemic insult.
It is characterized by an increment in renal perfusion rate, relief
of intraluminal obstruction of tubules, and restoration of im￾permeability of the tubular wall to the small filtration marker,
inulin (7, 8).
Over the past decade it has become routine practice to ad￾minister to susceptible patients protective substances such as
mannitol, furosemide, and dopamine before or during an isch￾emic renal insult. With the adoption of this practice, an isolated
single episode of renal ischemia no longer appears sufficient to
induce overt renal excretory failure in most instances (9). Rather,
more prolonged and often repeated episodes of renal ischemia
appear to be required before the clinical syndrome of ARF be￾comes manifest. A typical example of the latter is that which
follows prolonged and difficult cardiac surgery, notwithstanding
the use of protective agents (10-12). It occurs in the wake of
prolonged cardio-pulmonary bypass (.180 min [13]), during
which the kidneys are perfused at a low rate (-250 ml/min)
and at a hydraulic pressure low enough (-50 mmHg) to bring
glomerular filtration to a halt ( 14). Usually this initiating ischemic
insult is prolonged and compounded by impaired, postoperative
cardiac function (10, 13). We have shown previously that only
a minority of patients with this form of ARF (21/44) exhibit
recovery within 2 wk postinjury. As with the aforementioned
experimental analogue of postischemic ARF in the rat, recovery
followed circulatory improvement, as manifested by restoration
to normal of cardiac performance (10).
Because the phenomenon of postischemic ARF protracted
beyond 2 wk has become prevalent and carries a grave prognosis
(1 3, 15, 16), and because there is no animal model of ARF after
prolonged and partial renal ischemia, we have attempted to elu￾cidate directly the functional correlates of this common variant
of ARF in man. To do this we studied 10 patients in whom
ARF after cardiac surgery was protracted beyond 14 d. We used
the excretory dynamics of small filtration markers to examine
the role of intraluminal tubular obstruction, and the differential

clearance of filtration probes of graded size to evaluate transtu￾bular backleak ofglomerular filtrate. Our findings reveal a renal
injury that is quantitatively more severe than and qualitatively
different from human postischemic ARF of shorter duration.
Methods
Patient population and clinical background. Using a protocol and consent
procedure approved by the Stanford University Committee on the Use
of Human Subjects in Research, Stanford, CA, we studied 10 patients
with satisfactory premorbid renal function who developed protracted
ARF subsequent to surgery of the heart and great vessels. There were
eight men and two women who ranged in age from 34 to 77, with a
mean (±SE) of 64±4 yr. The development of ARF, initially nonoliguric
in all subjects, was manifested by the presence of progressive azotemia
accompanied by isosthenuria, and by the increased fractional excretion
of sodium (>1%) and water (urine-to-plasma inulin concentration ratio
< 20) (17). These subjects were selected for study because of unremitting
ARF despite several weeks of intensive medical and surgical care. Ac￾cordingly, studies of renal physiology were performed 23±4 d after the
onset of renal excretory failure (Table I).
For comparison, two other groups of subjects were evaluated. These
were: (1) Brief ARF group. This group included 32 age-matched patients
(63±2 yr), 21 males and 1 I females, in whom ARF resolved within 2
wk. In these subjects, ARF also developed after major cardiac surgery.
Studies ofrenal physiology were performed during a period ofincreasing
azotemia, on average 6±1 d after the onset of renal insufficiency. (2)
Stable chronic renal failure (CRF) group. This group included 30 patients
who had stable CRF of diverse etiology (43±3 yr, 15 males, 15 females).
Hemodynamic findings were similar in protracted and brief ARF
(control group 1) populations, as shown in Table II. Mean arterial pressure
averaged 74±3 vs. 80±3 mmHg, respectively. Mean increase in body
weights (compared with admission weights) were identical, 5±3 vs. 5±1%.
Large but similar percentages of patients in each group were receiving
vasoactive drugs at the time ofthe studies of renal physiology. In addition,
the colloid osmotic pressure of plasma was not significantly different in
the two groups, 22.1±1.0 vs. 23.3±0.5 mmHg. Measurements of he￾matocrits also did not significantly differ, 33±3 vs. 35±1%. The cardiac
index tended to be low in control subjects with brief ARF (2.47±0.12
liters/min per M2). Because appropriate vascular catheters were no longer
in place in subjects with protracted ARF, cardiac index could not be
determined. The tendency toward a low arterial pressure despite a volume￾expanded state and the administration of dopamine (n = 10), and in

Study protocol. Patients were examined during an episode of ARF
that was protracted, as judged by failure of recovery of renal excretory
function despite two or more weeks ofintensive medical care. All studies
were begun 24 h or more after the most recent hemodialysis treatment
when patients were hemodynamically stable and not hypovolemic. Fluid
balance was maintained during the study. Clearance studies were per￾formed by giving a single priming dose of inulin (60 mg/kg of body
weight) and technetium-labeled diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid
([9'Tc]DTPA, I mCi). A polydisperse solution of neutral dextran 40
(Rheomacrodex, Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Uppsala, Sweden, 140 mg/
kg) was thereafter given by infusion over a 20-min period. An in-dwelling
Foley catheter was used to collect urine specimens. To evaluate the ki￾netics of filtration marker clearance and distribution within the body,
blood and urine specimens were collected during the immediate post￾prime period at 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 min. Thereafter, clearance
studies were commenced with blood and urine collected each half hour
for 2 h and then hourly for an additional 2-4 h. From these plasma and
urine samples, the urinary clearances (C) of inulin and DTPA, the frac￾tional excretion of sodium (FEN.) and the urine-to-plasma (U/P) os￾molality ratio were determined. Clearances were calculated from the
ratio (UV)/(PT), where U = urinary concentration of the clearance
marker, V = urine flow rate, T = time of collection, and P = log mean
of clearance marker concentration in plasma samples bracketing the
urine collection. [p'Tc]DTPA was counted in urine and plasma with a
Packard gamma scintillation spectrometer (model 3002, Packard In￾strument Co., Inc., Downers Grove, IL). The assay ofthe remaining test
solutes employed in the present study has been described in detail pre￾viously (9, 10). In addition, plasma renin activity (PRA) was determined
as the rate of immunoassayable angiotensin I generated in plasma in￾cubated at pH 7.4 and at 370C (18).
After gel chromatographic separation of plasma and urine on pre￾calibrated Sephacryl S-300 columns (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals), the
fractional clearances of narrow dextran fractions (0D) were computed
using the equation
OD = (U/P)D/(U/P)IN, (1)
where (U/P)D and (U/P)N refer to urine-to-midpoint plasma concentra￾tion ratios of dextran and inulin, respectively.
In the two control groups, clearance studies were performed by ad￾ministering the priming dose followed by a constant infusion of inulin
resulting in a steady state plasma concentration. After an equilibration
period lasting 60 min, four 30-mintimed urine collections were made
and blood was obtained at the beginning and end of each period. Clear￾ances were calculated as reported previously (9-12).

(inulin and dextran) from damaged tubules have been reported in detail
previously (I 1). In brief, we have assumed that glomerular permeability
to inulin and dextran was not different between patients with protracted
ARF and those with CRF in whom inulin clearance was depressed to
similarly low levels (< 15 ml/min per 1.73 m2). It follows that any elevation
of 6D in ARF when compared with 0D in CRF might be due to the
backleak ofinulin through damaged tubules at a greater rate than backleak
of the larger filtered dextran molecules. The use of a population with
CRF as a control group is novel. It has the advantage that even the
smallest component molecules in dextran 40 are retained in serum be￾cause of the low glomerular filtration rate (GFR), thus permitting for
the first time a comparison between the experimental and control group
of the fractional clearance of dextran molecules of radius below 20 A.
When the permeability properties ofthe tubule are normal, all inulin
and dextran cleared by the glomerulus and appearing in the glomerular
filtrate is assumed to reach the final urine. It is this assumption that
permits estimation of the dextran ultrafiltration characteristics of the
glomerular capillary wall (19). For the kidney in ARF, however, we pro￾pose that tubule backleak of inulin (and also dextrans) occurs; if we
further assume that such leakage is "passive" (that is, occurs solely by
ultrafiltration and/or diffusion through the damaged tubule wall), then
the rate of leakage of any such solute should be nearly proportional to
the concentration of that solute in the glomerular filtrate. Under such
circumstances, the fractional backleak of inulin (defined as the rate of
backleak divided by the GFR) will be constant (kjn). Precisely the same
criteria apply to any dextran species of the ith molecular radius (rDi),
leading to a fractional dextran backleak of kDi. However, the permeability
ofthe damaged tubule wall to dextrans would be expected to be a declining
function of the size of the dextran molecule,
kDi = f(rDi), (2)
where kDi - k,. as rD. - r..; kD -*0 as r> -* 00. Simple mass-balance
computations of inulin and dextran cleared by the glomerulus lead to
the following relationship (I 1):
Oam = O[I - kDJ/(l - kj) = [I - f(rD)]/(l - k1), (3)
where O.,, is the apparent sieving coefficient for the i'th dextran based
solely on plasma and urine concentration measurements, and ( is the
sieving coefficient ofthe glomerular capillary wall for that dextran. Qual￾itatively, we can deduce from Eq. 3 that, for large dextran molecules
where kD; = 0, Oapp > e (since [I - k,,] > 0), while for small dextran
molecules where kDi = ki,, O1 -p 0.
Assuming that the dextran sieving characteristics of the glomerular
capillary wall in protracted ARF are the same as those in severe CRF,
Eq. 3 can be reduced to:
Oam/0 = (I - k)/(l - kjn) = [1/(1 - kjn)] - [kD/l - kin)], (4)
where 0 now equals the fractional dextran clearance in CRF. Further,
kin is a constant for a given subject, whereas kD; is a function of ri. As
rD1-r3, k,,- kj, and as rDi - oo, kDi - 0. Hence, the ratio (O.pp/O)
should increase with rDi from a value of unity (for small rDi) to a limiting
value of 1/(1 - k1.) as r increases. Since, as r - 00, 0 -*0, a plot of(O../
0) vs. r should permit a reasonably accurate extrapolation to the limiting
value of (O,./O) - 1/(1 - ki,). This permits calculation of kn,,.
Since k, is the fraction of filtered inulin that leaks back,
corrected GFR = [l ]Cil] (5)
where C,, denotes inulin clearance.
Measurement ofthe inulin residence time in the urinary dead space.
After the intravenous administration of inulin or DTPA, the filtration
marker distributes in plasma, in an extravascular, extracellular space and
in a third volume extending from Bowman's space to the urinary bladder
(the so-called urinary dead space [20]). There is a delay in the appearance
of the injectate in the final bladder urine (10, 20). Inulin excretion rises
slowly with time, reaches a peak, and then declines pari passu with the
falling plasma concentration of inulin. The time required for inulin to
traverse the dead space (T.) and the time required for peak urinary inulin
excretion to be observed depend upon several factors. The first is the
existence of a pool of tubular fluid and urine known as the urinary dead
space, which consists of part or all of the volume of the renal tubules,
pelves, and ureters (10, 20). Larger dead space volumes (or lower tubular
fluid flow rates) will result in a greater delay in inulin appearance and a
longer time to peak excretion. The second potential factor affecting both
T. and the time to peak urinary inulin excretion is leakage ofglomerular
filtrate across the damaged renal tubular epithelium. Ifpresent, backleak
decreases net urinary clearance of inulin and, therefore, the apparent
GFR as well. A third set of factors affecting T. is the relationship of
plasma volume to apparent GFR and the associated rate of clearance of
inulin from plasma into the extravascular space. As plasma volume in￾creases or the rate of extravascular accumulation decreases, T,, prolongs.
We have previously analyzed the kinetics of inulin excretion by de￾vising a 3-compartment model that permits determination of the mean
residence time of inulin in plasma and the urinary dead space (10). In
the present study we have modified the earlier 3-compartment solution
to include the effects of transtubular backleak of the filtered solute. The
modification yields the following formulation:
(Tm..)- = ((T.)-' - (T*)-')/(Ln[(T*/T,)]). (6)
T.,,,,,, time after bolus injection when urinary inulin (or DTPA) excretion
rate is maximal. T,, urinary dead space mean residence time where T.
= UDS* V; UDs is the volume in milliliters ofthe dead space and Vis the
rate of urine flow in milliliters per minute. Tp, mean residence time of
inulin/DTPA in plasma. It is determined by the plasma volume and by
the clearances of inulin or DTPA: (a) from plasma into the urine by
glomerular filtration; (b) from plasma into the extravascular space; and
finally (c), from tubular fluid back into the vascular and extravascular
spaces by the rate of backleak. During ARF, with low urinary excretion
rates, T* is calculated at long times after the bolus injection of inulin/
DTPA, when plasma and extravascular spaces have equilibrated and the
"'clearance" of inulin or DTPA into the extravascular space is nil. The
rate of backleak of a given solute depends upon its molecular size and
the extent of increased permeability of the injured tubular epithelium.
Thus, T* = plasma volume/[corrected GFR-(I - ka,)]. As backleak
increases, net urinary clearance diminishes and the mean plasma residence
time rises. Therefore, the time to peak urinary inulin excretion may
become substantially prolonged.
Statistical analysis. All results are expressed as mean±SEM. Data
for the experimental and two control populations were analyzed and
compared with the Stat Plus General Statistical Package (Human Systems
Dynamics, Northridge, CA). An unpaired two-tailed t test or the Mann￾Whitney U test was used to test the significance ofthe differences observed.
Linear regression analysis was used to examine the strength ofassociations
between variables.
Results
Clinical and laboratoryfindings. The results of 10 studies during
the course of protracted ARF are shown in Table III and com￾pared with those of 32 subjects having ARF of brief duration.
As noted previously, episodes of ARF were lengthy in the ex￾perimental group, averaging 36±4 d until death supervened or
recovery of function was observed. 7 of 10 patients were receiving
dialytic support. The profound depression in renal function is
indicated by the inulin clearance, which averaged only 5.0±1.7,
a value significantly less than the corresponding value of 14±1
ml/min per 1.73 m2 observed in the brief ARF comparison pop￾ulation (control group 1). 5 of 10 patients with protracted ARF
were oliguric (V . 0.3 ml/min); for all studies, urine flow av￾eraged only 0.6±0.2 ml/min. Fractional sodium excretion was

tionship to the rate of sodium excretion (coefficient of correlation
--0.5).
Time to peak inulin excretion and T,. As shown in Fig. 1,
mean inulin excretion rate reached a maximum at - 120 min
in patients with protracted ARF. In comparison, subjects with
ARF of brief duration (control group 1) achieved maximal ex￾cretion rates much earlier, at I min, albeit at highly different
maximal rates commensurate with renal function. The latter
value is similar to that observed by us previously in postoperative
subjects with normal renal function (10). The estimated urinary
dead space volume (UDs) in patients with protracted ARF was
smaller than that of brief ARF controls (10±1.6 vs. 15.6±2.0
ml, P < 0.05). Further insight into the physiology of the urinary
dead space may be obtained with the aid of the linear regression
analysis depicted in Fig. 2, which demonstrates the relationship
between urine flow rate V and UDs. As shown, UDS is directly
related to V(coefficient ofcorrelation = 0.7). Thus, UDs exhibits
a kinetic compliance. Hence, with lower urine flow rates, as in
subjects with prolonged ARF, UDS is also diminished. From the
relationship in Fig. 2, it can be predicted that a minimal dead
space volume of 6 ml exists (3 ml per kidney and ureter), even
with complete anuria.2
The Tu was markedly increased in subjects with protracted
ARF (80±45 min), and greatly exceeded that of control patients
with brief ARF (9±1 min, P < 0.01). However, Tu is directly
proportional to the volume of the urinary dead space but in￾versely related to urine flow rate, i.e.,
2. Our findings are in keeping with an earlier study in the dog by Bojesen
(20). He demonstrated both kinetic compliance and a similarly small
volume of the dead space at low rates of urine flow in canine kidneys
weighing 100-150 g. Bojesen (20) validated the veracity of estimates of
dead space volume from the kinetics of inulin excretion by making si￾multaneous direct determinations of pelvic volume over a wide range
of urine flow rates.

Since UDS also declines as Vdecreases (Fig. 2), any prolongation
of T0 caused by falling urine flow is to some degree abbreviated
by the coincident reduction in UDS.
Fractional inulin leakage. We have previously demonstrated
the transtubular backleak of filtered inulin and dextran during
ARF of brief duration (1 1, 12). In Fig. 3, the mean fractional
dextran clearance profile for patients with protracted ARF (OAF)
is plotted as a function of the gel chromatographic radius of the
dextran, rD, in the interval 17-40 A. For comparison, also de￾picted is the fractional dextran clearance profile of the 30 subjects
of the second control group with stable CRF (OCRF). As shown,
OARP iS strikingly and significantly (P < 0.01) elevated above 0cRF
for all dextran fractions in the rD interval 17-40 A. Several points
deserve additional emphasis: (1) OCRF approaches but does not
exceed unity for rD 17-20 A (0.96 ' 0.'0.92); (2) OCRF for larger
dextran fractions (rD> 20 A) declines monotonically toward
zero; (3) in striking contrast, only when rD> 28 A is OARF less
than unity; (4) when a single patient (#3), in whom there was
no detectable backleak is excluded, OARF significantly exceeds
unity for rD= 18 A and 19 A (P < 0.05); and (5) for rD= 17
and 20 A <rD < 26 A, OARY also exceeds unity, although the
difference fails narrowly to achieve statistical significance.

From Eq. 4, it may be calculated for the experimental pop￾ulation that -44% of filtered inulin emigrates from the tubular
lumen (fractional inulin leakage, kin) and thus fails to reach the
final urine. Because of interpatient variability of fractional dex￾tran clearance profiles for the protracted ARF studies, fractional
inulin leakage was determined for each subject, with one excep￾tion. The value of kCn was then used to correct those experimental
variables affected by inulin backleak: inulin clearance, Tm.,, and
TU. Data are shown in Table IV. There was a single subject (#3)
who apparently had no backleak despite severe ARF. Otherwise,
values for kin varied from 0.21 to 0.66, reflecting considerable
variability in the extent of increased tubular permeability, with
the result that transtubular inulin leakage may differ more than
threefold between individuals. In subject 6, no inulin or dextrans
were detected in the final urine despite the presence of both in
plasma, which could theoretically reflect an extreme backleak
of 100%, i.e., kin = 1. (In the absence of measurable dextran and
inulin clearances, however, actual fractional backleak cannot be
calculated.) For nine patients, inulin clearances corrected for
backleak varied from 0.4 to 27.9 ml/min, averaging only 9.6
ml/min. Clearly, inulin backleak cannot wholly account for the
grave reduction in GFR associated with protracted ARF. In these
nine subjects, the time to peak inulin excretion, when corrected
for backleak, was shortened from 120 to 102 min. The Tu de￾creased from 33.8 to 20 min. Even when corrected for transtu￾bular inulin backleak, both the time to peak inulin excretion
and the Tu are considerably prolonged when compared with
corresponding values in the control population with brief ARF
(Table IV).
Fractional dextran leakage. Not only filtered inulin leaks
back from the damaged tubule, however. Were such to be true,
then a fractional dextran clearance profile for the ARF popu￾lation very different from that actually observed would be pre￾dicted. Fig. 4 displays the calculated fractional dextran clearance
(O@aculatd) that would obtain if the tubule discriminated perfectly
against molecules larger than inulin, so that approximately one￾half of filtered inulin, but no filtered dextran, were to escape the
injured tubule. The hypothetical, calculated fractional clearance
profile (top curve) represents therefore a twofold multiplication
of control fractional dextran clearances (bottom curve). The
fractional dextran clearance profile observed for protracted ARF
(middle curve) clearly differs from both the upper and lower
curves: it is elevated above the lower curve but depressed below
the upper curve because both dextran and inulin leak back, al￾though the percentage of inulin lost (rinulin = 15 A) exceeds that
of the larger dextran molecules. The difference between observed
(o) and predicted (p) curves reflects fractional dextran leakage
(kD = [p - o]/p). As shown, the difference between the two
curves varies continuously as rD changes, declining as rD in￾creases.
The quantities kin and kDi (where Di refers to an arbitrary
dextran fraction of radius i) represent the individual rates of
transport of inulin and the ith dextran across the damaged tu￾bular epithelial barrier. The ratio (kDdkin) may be taken, there￾fore, as a measure of the relative permeability of the epithelium
to the ith dextran with respect to inulin. An examination of (kD(/
kin) for dextrans in the radius interval 17-40 A is therefore in￾structive. The results of these calculations are plotted in Fig. 5.
The accompanying fractional dextran clearance profile of the
glomerulus in CRF (OCRF, Fig. 3) is included for comparison.
Relative to the glomerulus, it appears that the damaged tubule
exhibits somewhat diminished permeability to dextrans of all

molecular sizes examined, and that the permeability declines at
a rate (slope of the curve) which is similar to that of the glo￾merular sieving curve for rD> 24 A. The relative tubular per￾meability is zero at rD > 34 A, even in the presence of a severe
tubular injury. This finding provides an explanation for the ob￾servation in the rodent model of postischemic ARF that proteins
of molecular radius .30 A cannot traverse the damaged tubular
wall (3, 6).
Recovery offunction after protracted ARE. 4 ofthe 10 patients
with sustained ARF recovered satisfactory renal excretory ca￾pacity. All survived (patients 1, 2, 4, and 10). The remaining six
patients failed to recover renal function and each died. Data are
summarized in Table V. Inulin clearance, though profoundly
subnormal, was nonetheless greater in the subgroup that sub￾sequently recovered (11 ± 1 vs. 1±0.3 ml/nin per 1.73 m2). The
superior rate of inulin clearance was further reflected by a lesser
time to peak inulin excretion (50±14 vs. 170±60 min). Those

who ultimately recovered satisfactory function had significantly
higher urine flow rates, while those who exhibited no recovery
were frankly oliguric (1.1±0.2 vs. 0.2±0.01 mI/min). Commen￾surate with the urine flow, urinary dead space volumes also dif￾fered (I6±2 vs. 7±1 ml). The combination of higher dead space
volume but greater tubular flow nevertheless resulted in a shorter
Tu (18±6 vs. 47±13 min). Patients who recovered also exhibited
significantly less hyperreninemia (2.3±0.3 vs. 27.0±3.0 ng/ml
per h). Thus, the extent of injury to the nephron in ARF may
represent a graded response to the degree of underlying renal
ischemia. As the latter increases in severity and duration, the
manifest injury appears to advance through a brief form ofARF
(control group 1) to a protracted, but reversible injury, or ulti￾mately to an irreversible renal injury.

Discussion
Tubular obstruction. The severity of the renal injury sustained
by the subjects of the current study is attested to by the loss of
96% of normal renal capacity to clear inulin from plasma. Fur￾thermore, this impairment of function persisted on average for
5 wk, terminating either in recovery in a minority of patients
or more often in the patients' demise. Compared with the results
of previous studies from this laboratory, both the time to peak
inulin excretion and T, were markedly prolonged (10). Profound
oliguria was also more frequently observed. These findings are
similar to those of the maintenance phase of postischemic ARF
in the rodent. In keeping with the more direct measurements in
the rat (3-7), the prolongation of Tu in our patients may reflect
significant tubular obstruction. In a prior study of nonoliguric
postischemic ARF in man, in which measured renal impairment
was less severe and of shorter duration, T, was found to be
normal (10). Given the demonstrated variability among indi￾vidual nephrons of tubular obstruction in the rodent model (4,
5), a possible explanation for this finding was the existence of a
small subpopulation of widely patent, unobstructed tubules (10).
The existence of a sparse collection of tubules having unimpeded
flow may be abetted by higher tubular fluid flow rates (signaled
by nonoliguria); tubule cellular flotsam which would otherwise
obstruct the tubular lumina could be literally washed away (10).
The severe reduction in urine flow rate observed in our patients
with protracted ARF may have reflected sluggish tubular fluid
flow. This, in turn, could have contributed to more diffuse in￾tratubular obstruction, and hence to the prolongation of both
time to peak inulin excretion and Tu. Thus, the threefold pro￾longation of Tu observed in the current study suggests the absence
of completely patent tubules and the possibility of a much more
homogeneous pattern of tubular injury. This finding is necessary,
but insufficient by itself, to validate the concept that tubular
obstruction may become generalized in this prolonged variant
of human ARF.
Tubular leakage. The presence of transtubular backleak in
our experimental subjects with protracted ARF is attested to by
the finding of fractional dextran clearances that exceed unity, a
phenomenon not observed in controls with CRF. Fractional
dextran clearances in excess of unity must signify that either
smaller inulin molecules leak back from the tubule with greater
facility than larger dextrans, or that larger dextrans permeate
the glomerular filter more easily than the smaller inulin molecule.
It is difficult to conceive of any circumstance in which a larger
molecule could by passive forces move more rapidly through
the glomerular capillary wall than a smaller molecule. We infer,
therefore, that the former explanation is correct and that there
is in protracted ARF a size-dependent backleak of filtered mol￾ecules to which the tubule is normally impermeable.
From Eq. 3 we calculate that kins the fraction of filtered
inulin that leaked back, was 0.44, a finding in good agreement
with the magnitude of inulin backleak in the rat with an anal￾ogous acute renal injury (4, 6, 7). However, the calculation of
ki, rests upon the assumption that the Bowman's space-to-plasma
concentration ratio (or glomerular sieving coefficient) of each
dextran molecule in ARF does not differ from the corresponding
value in the control population (group 2). Transcapillary dextran
flux into Bowman's space is governed in part by the same de￾terminants that control the ultrafiltration process. GFR in ex￾perimental ARF declines primarily because of a reduction in
the net transmembrane ultrafiltration pressure (4, 8, 21), while
this latter quantity is elevated in CRF, in which GFR depression
is caused by a reduction of the glomerular ultrafiltration coef￾ficient, Kf (22). Despite these differences in the determinants of
GFR in the two disorders, their net effect is to lower the filtration
fraction. A lower filtration fraction will blunt the rise in con￾centration of a retained macromolecule as plasma transits along
the glomerular capillaries (23), thereby lowering both diffusive
and convective components of transcapillary dextran transport
(19). Since the extent by which the filtration fraction is lowered
in protracted ARF is unknown, the assumption ofdextran sieving
coefficients for the glomerulus identical to those in the CRF
group (and hence our computation of kin) may be in error. Ac￾cordingly, the corrected values for true GFR and mean residence
time of inulin in the urinary dead space in protracted ARF (Table
IV) should be regarded as approximations only.
Uncertainty regarding the actual value of kn also limits the
precision with which the ratio kDi/kin can be used to characterize
the permselectivity of the damaged tubular wall in protracted
ARF. In this case, moreover, it is necessary to make an additional
assumption that the transport of inulin through the damaged
tubular epithelial barrier in protracted ARF is unrestricted. Only
in this latter circumstance can the ratio kD/kifl be regarded un￾equivocally as a sieving coefficient for the injured tubule. That
inulin indeed passes through the injured tubular barrier in un￾restricted fashion is suggested by the identity of its urinary clear￾ance with that of DTPA. DTPA has a molecular weight of
393 daltons and a molecular radius of -4 A. Inulin is heavier
by tenfold and substantially larger (radius = 15 A). Since both
solutes are freely filtered across the glomerular capillary wall
(24), the equality oftheir urinary clearances in the present study
suggests that their respective rates of backleak across the injured
tubular wall are not different. This implies that in ARF the tran￾stubular transport of molecules the size of inulin or smaller is
unrestricted. The ratio kDik/ln can then be used to provide a
1446 S. M. Moran and B. D. Myers

reasonably accurate description of the size-selective properties
of the tubular epithelial barrier. From the relationship between
the ratio kD/1k, and dextran radius we infer that the injured
tubular wall behaves as a membrane with a rather sharp cut-off,
displaying almost complete impermeability to dextrans of radius
above 34 A. This membrane size-selectivity is in keeping with
earlier observations in postischemic rodent ARF in which neither
horseradish peroxidase (r = 30 A) nor albumin (r = 36 A) leaked
back across the damaged tubular wall (6, 3).
The structure in the injured tubular wall most likely to behave
as an effective barrier to the passage of macromolecules may be
the tubular basement membrane. This collagenous structure has
a composition not unlike that of the glomerular basement mem￾brane. Thus, the similarity between the permselective properties
of the damaged tubule in ARF and that of the glomerular cap￾illary wall (Fig. 5) could be construed as pointing to the tubular
basement membrane as the structure in protracted ARF that
ultimately prevents the egress of dextrans of 34 A radius and
larger from tubule fluid into the interstitium. The microdissection
studies by Oliver and his coworkers (25) of individual nephrons
from patients with protracted ARF are in keeping with this pos￾sibility. They observed a patchy detachment of necrotic tubular
epithelial cells from the underlying tubular basement membrane,
a phenomenon for which they coined the term tubulorrhexis.
The denuded basement membrane remained intact, however,
forming a continuous layer along the length of the necrotic tu￾bule.
Recovery offunction after ARF. In the rat, recovery from
postischemic ARF has been presaged by increasing renal blood
flow (8). Presumably restoration oftheir blood supply is necessary
before necrotic tubular cells can regenerate. Because the ability
of proximal tubular cells to secrete p-amino-hippuric acid is
profoundly impaired during ARF (2, 8, 9), the clearance of p￾amino-hippuric acid cannot be used to measure renal plasma
flow in this circumstance. In the absence of an alternative, non￾invasive method, we were unable to confirm the presence of
renal underperfusion in the present study. That renal plasma
flow in our patients with protracted ARF flow was severely de￾pressed nonetheless, is suggested by the observation of extreme
hyperreninemia. Similar elevations of active plasma renin levels
by 20- or 30-fold have been observed by others during the oliguric
phase of ARF. These levels have tended to decline as early oli￾goanuria gives way to the diuretic phase (26, 27). It may be that
extreme elevations of PRA (and hence the vasoconstrictor an￾giotensin II) delay recovery from ARF. The findings in those
subjects destined to recover of larger urine flow rates and greater
inulin clearances coupled with less hyperreninemia are com￾patible with this view. In keeping with the finding that maneuvers
that suppress the renin-angiotensin axis do not protect uniformly
against subsequent ARF (28), hyperreninemia during ARF may
be a secondary phenomenon, and its suppression may have im￾portance only in facilitating the onset of recovery.
We conclude that the brief and protracted forms of ARF
described in the present study represent a continuum of post￾ischemic renal injury. Protracted ARF differs from the abbre￾viated injury in that the reductions in urine formation and inulin
clearance are more profound. Even when corrected for backleak,
the GFR is substantially lower in protracted than in brief ARF,
10±3 vs. 28±4 ml/min per 1.73 m2, respectively. Clearly, factors
other than backleak must be invoked to explain the disparity.
More marked and diffuse intraluminal tubular obstruction in
protracted ARF, with consequent reduction of the transmem￾brane hydraulic pressure gradient, may be one such factor. A
greater decline in glomerular perfusion rate due to extreme sec￾ondary hyperangiotensinemia may be another. We wish to em￾phasize, however, that there is at present no analogous animal
model of greatly protracted ARF after prolonged and partial
(and frequently repetitive) ischemic renal insults. Confirmation
of the findings inferred from our necessarily indirect approach
in human protracted ARF must await the development of a
corresponding renal injury in experimental animals. Because of
the lethal nature of protracted ARF in man, the development
of an appropriate animal model is urgently required. Only by
learning how to attenuate this severe form of ARF in the labo￾ratory is an effective therapeutic strategy for the human renal
injury likely to eventuate.
