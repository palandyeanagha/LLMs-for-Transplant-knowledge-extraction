Summary: Two patients developed reticulum cell
sarcomata after they had been treated with azathio￾prine and prednisone in the course of cadaveric renal
transplantation. Both had terminal widespread herpes
simplex virus infection.
Immunosuppressive therapy could be responsible for an
increased risk of malignant lymphomata either directly or
by facilitating infection with oncogenic viruses.

Introduction
Neoplasia has been postulated as a potential complication of
depression of the immune system by drugs (Swanson and
Schwartz, 1967). We report two cases in which reticulum
cell sarcomata developed after renal homotransplantation and
treatment with azathioprine and prednisone.
Case 1
The patient, a 34-year-old man with renal failure due to chronic
glomerulonephritis, was started on regular haemodialysis treatment
in June 1966. Bilateral nephrectomy was performed in September,
and a disrupted wound left him with a large ventral hernia. In
November he received two unsuccessful kidney transplants from
cadavers, receiving treatment with azathioprine and prednisone for
seven days. Regular haemodialysis treatment was continued until
April 1967, when a third kidney was transplanted from a 38-year￾old man who died of cerebral trauma. Necropsy of the donor
showed no evidence of neoplasia. The kidney functioned well, and
the creatinine clearance rose to 70 ml./min. within one month of
transplantation. Four mild episodes of transplant rejection with
temporary decline in renal function were treated with high doses of
prednisone. Actinomycin C 400 pg. was also given three times.
The mean daily dose of azathioprine was 75 mg. The mean
prednisone dose for the first three months was 60 mg. daily, and
thereafter 35 mg. daily. The ventral incisional hernia was repaired
with a Teflon patch in July, but a staphylococcal infection of the
wound developed and persisted until death.
In September he developed extensive herpetic lesions on the lips
and inside his mouth. Candida albicans was cultured from the oral
swab, and he was given local nystatin and gentian violet, followed by
intravenous amphotericin (120 mg. in four days). The tongue
became ulcerated, and the oral lesions extended to involve the
oesophagus. He had marked cervical adenopathy, and both epi￾trochlear glands were enlarged.
During the final six weeks of life he also received penicillin and
cloxacilhin and kanamycin. Local iododeoxyuridine 1% was applied
to the herpetic lesions without benefit. His general condition
deteriorated steadily, though renal function remained satisfactory
until he died in November 1967.
At necropsy there was severe ulceration of the skin of the lips,
the right side of the face, and both eyelids. There was a large ulcer
near the tip of the tongue measuring 2 cm. across. Histological
examination of the tongue showed the ulcerated surface to contain
many Gram-negative bacilli, Gram-positive cocci, and small num￾bers of the spores and hyphae consistent with C. albicans. Deep
to the area of ulceration and extending among the striated muscle
and fat was a malignant tumour. The lower two-thirds of the
oesophagus showed many deep ulcers, small numbers of Gram￾positive cocci, and Gram-negative bacilli, but no fungal elements
were seen. In the submucosa were small numbers of cells with
large nuclei, often vacuolated, containing viral inclusion bodies.
In the deeper parts of the submucosa were small clumps of tumour
cells.
The liver weighed 2,940 g. When cut across it showed many
tumour nodules, the largest measuring 1.5 cm. across (Fig. 1). They
were red with mottled white areas. Marked fatty degeneration was
present with no increase in fibrous tissue or any bile duct prolifera￾tion. Many small necrotic areas in which liver cells had disappeared
and which contained degenerating red cells were seen. Among
this necrotic tissue, but also in viable liver tissue, there were malig￾Protected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies.

The tumour had the appearance of a malignant lymphoma of t.e
subtype reticulum cell sarcoma (Fig. 2). Discussion
Burnet (1967) postulated that the immune system plays an ......0 _XL A important part in preventing or restricting the growth of neo￾plastic cells, and the concept that neoplasia might occur as a
complication of treatment with immunosuppressive agents was
suggested by Swanson and Schwartz (1967). Malignant
lymphomata in the present two cases may have resulted from
immunosuppressive therapy, which was given for eight and
nine months after renal transplantation. Marked immuno￾suppression in these patients was shown by the prolonged
survival of the transplanted kidney, transient leucopenia, and
marked susceptibility to infection. Of 38 patients receiving
renal homografts in this unit 11 others have died. In none of
these was neoplasia detected.
A case of reticulum cell sarcoma following renal transplanta￾I-: f '3 2 4 5 tion and treatment with azathioprine, prednisone, and anti- 0 2 cm. lymphocyte serum has occurred in Edinburgh (Woodruff,
FIG 1.ease 1 Slice of liver showing nodules of tumour. 1968), and four similar cases have been quoted (Lancet, 1968).
Our patients had the same type of lymphoma, and it is of
great interest that primary neoplasms occurring after renal
-. .~ homotransplantation have been of the reticuloendothelial
~system.
Other examples of neoplasms appearing after renal homo-
-_ transplantation have apparently been transplanted. On
four occasions a neoplasm of a type present in the donor's body
but not obviously involving the kidney has appeared in the
recipient after renal homotransplantation (Dossetor, 1965
McPhaul and McIntosh, 1965 ; Martin et al., 1965; Wilson
et al., 1968), and in one case (Wilson et al., 1968) cessation of immunosuppressive therapy may have contributed to the
apparent disappearance of the tumour after partial excision.
These patients appeared to have an impaired ability to prevent
or restrict the growth of neoplastic cells which was probably
due to treatment with immunosuppressive drugs.
NecropsyThat the immunosuppressive agents themselves may have
dail unproduced lymphomahta where these have appeared after renal
homtotransplantation is suggested by the fact that treatment with

muscle (H and E. x 330) increased incidence of lymphomata in NZB and NZB/NZW
hybrid mice (Casey, 1967, 1968a,- 1968b) and in C,7BL mice
(Doell et al., 1967). This effect could have been produced by
Case 2 interference with nucleic acid metabolism of the rapidly divid￾ing cell or by activation of an oncogenic virus. The, latter
A 46-year old woman with chronic glomerulonephritis was given
regular haemodialysis treatment for three months before receiving a

possibility receives some support from the finding of virus
particles, possible oncogenic, in cells of NZB mice (East et al.,
1967). Other immunosuppressive agents might have similar
effects.
Woodruff (1968) reported the recurrence of reticulum cell
sarcoma in one patient who died 25 months after transplanta￾tion, and had received antilymphocyte serum in addition to
azathioprine and prednisone. Antilymphocyte serum has been
shown to be a potent immunosuppressive agent in animals
(Levey and Medawar, 1966; Lance and Medawar, 1968), and
its use in man has apparently contributed to increased survival
rates of transplanted kidneys from live related donors (Starzl
et al., 1968). This serum has also been used in experiments
designed to test the role of the immune system in limiting the
growth of malignant tumours. The results of several experi￾ments are consistent with the theory that the intact immune
system does limit the growth of neoplastic cells but do not
provide unequivocal proof (Allison and Law, 1968; Deodhar
et al., 1968; Hellman et al., 1968). The finding that the
administration of antilymphocyte serum to mice infected with
Maloney leukaemogenic virus results in the development of
reticulum sarcomas is of special interest (Allison and Law,
1968).
The extensive suggestive evidence that viruses may produce
malignant lymphoproliferative disease in the presence of
immunological abnormalities has been reviewed by Schwartz
and Andre-Schwartz (1968). Since both our patients had
extensive herpes simplex infection for some weeks before death
the possible role of this virus in the production of lymphomata
deserves consideration. Herpes-like virus has been incriminated
in the pathogenesis of lymphomatosis of fowls (Churchill and
Biggs, 1967), and another herpes-like virus, EBV, has been
found in the cells of Burkitt's lymphoma grown in tissue
culture (Epstein et al., 1964). However, since herpes virus
infections are common after renal homotransplantation, and in
our series of 38 cases has contributed to death in four, it is
probable that this infection was associated with prolonged
immunosuppressive therapy and coincident with, rather than
causative of, the malignant lymphoma.
It is possible that the increased cellular activity of the
immune system in response to a transplanted organ would
increase the tendency for neoplastic cells to develop by spon￾taneous mutation. The occurrence of lymphomata in mice
undergoing the graft-versus-host reaction would be consistent
with this view (Schwartz and Beldotti, 1965).
The mechanism of production of reticulum cell sarcomata in
patients after renal homotransplantation is not known, and the
cause, which may be multifactorial, can only be speculated
about. It seems likely, however, that the use of potent immuno￾suppressive agents, probably including antilymphocyte serum,
will lead to an increased incidence of primary neoplasia,
especially malignant lymphoma.
We thank Mr. A. J. Duke and Mr. C. H. Maclaurin for
performing the renal homotransplant operations on these patients.

Summary: Human adult haemoglobin consists of two
unlike pairs of polypeptide chains, and can be
described as 2 i2.no-acid substitutions in either of
the two types of chain result in a- and 8-chain variants.
In thalassaemia, which causes a levered production of
haemoglobin, the a or the /3 chain can be affected, the
result being a- or 83-thalassaemia. There is a quantitative
difference in the proportion of a- and /3-chain variants
to normal haemoglobin in the respective heterozygotes,
and there is also a difference in the pattern of inheritance
of a- and /3-thalassaemia: these could possibly be
explained by assuming that man has one gene for the
/- and two for the a-chain.
Introduction
The globin polypeptide chains of the known animal haemo￾globins and of the myoglobins differ considerably in their
primary amino-acid sequence, but they resemble each other in
their three-dimensional (tertiary) structure. An amino-acid
residue of such a chain can be denoted by the number it occupies
in the sequence. Normal adult human haemoglobin, Haemo￾globin A, is formed by two pairs of unlike chains, a and OR,
