A systematic review of the psychometric
properties of transition readiness assessment
tools in adolescents with chronic disease

Abstract
Background: Health care transition of adolescents with chronic conditions may be unsuccessful when patients
have not acquired the necessary skills and developmental milestones. It is therefore critical for health care providers
to assess the readiness for transition of their adolescent patients. This is currently hindered by the lack of a
recognised, well-established transition-readiness assessment tool.
Methods: We conducted a systematic review of all transition-readiness tools for adolescents with chronic medical
conditions published in peer-reviewed journals. Tools were rated by the methodological quality of the validation
studies, and the psychometric measurement qualities of each tool.
Results: Ten different assessment tools were identified. Seven targeted specific diseases and 3 tools were generic.
Most tools were poorly validated with only one tool, the Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire (TRAQ)
demonstrating adequate content validity, construct validity, and internal consistency.
Conclusion: The TRAQ was the best-validated transition-readiness tool, with additional benefits of disease-neutrality.
Further research should focus on testing the predictive validity of this tool, and exploring correlation with
transition-outcomes, in an international population.

Background
Health care transition is the “process of purposeful,
planned movement of adolescents with chronic medical
conditions from child to adult-centred healthcare systems”
[1]. It includes the transition of responsibility from the
parent to the child, and preparation for the transfer event
[2]. Currently, 90% of adolescents with chronic diseases
will survive into adulthood, and will be undergoing this
process [3]. Suboptimal transition has detrimental effects
on access to medical care, disease outcome, education,
and opportunities for a successful adulthood [4].
Transition of adolescents with chronic conditions can
be a challenging operation that requires a concerted effort
from paediatric and adult health care providers, parents or
carers, and individual patients. Much has been written
about how to best optimise transition and multiple guide￾lines have been produced. Most guidelines consistently
recommend that paediatric providers should assess an
adolescent’s readiness for transition to individualise transi￾tion planning. In this regard, the most recent consensus
statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics and
American College of Physicians [5] states that “practices
should select a readiness-assessment tool to use that can
be modified for specific patient situations”. The report
goes on to state that “regardless of the tool chosen, it
should contain specific minimum components that pro￾vide an accurate, point-in-time assessment of the indivi￾dual patient’s ability to transition successfully”. Despite its
importance and the availability of a number of tools and
checklists, there is evidence to suggest that assessment of
readiness for transition is not uniformly performed. For
example, a review of 87% of cystic fibrosis (CF) transition
programs in the United States found that only 50% * Correspondence: sean.kennedy@unsw.edu.au 1

perform readiness assessments, <10% have a list of desir￾able skills, and only 26% of these addressed pertinent skills
such as insurance [6]. There is therefore a need to identify
a valid, well-established transition readiness tool which
can be used in diverse settings.
This systematic review aims to summarise the vali￾dation of all published transition-readiness tools for ado￾lescents (aged 11-19 years) with chronic disease. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first review of transi￾tion readiness tools, and the authors hope it will clarify
which tool is optimal for clinical application.
Methods
Search strategy
A literature search of the electronic databases Medline,
Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL and PsycInfo, and
Google Scholar, was undertaken between February￾October 2013. The search terms included permutations
of “(transition or transfer) and readiness”, “healthcare
(transition or transfer)”, and “adolescents or young
adults or children”. We additionally included the terms
“assess”, “measure”, “tool”, or “questionnaire”, however
these yielded no new results. Citation searches, and
reference lists were also reviewed, and the name and pri￾mary author of each questionnaire included was searched
in Google Scholar for cross-references to the tool. We also
searched Google using the phrase “adolescent transition
readiness”. Please see Figure 1 for flow diagram of the
search, and Additional file 1 for full search strategy.
Study selection
One reviewer screened each title and abstract for inclu￾sion. All studies which developed, discussed, or eva￾luated tools for assessing transition readiness involving
adolescents (aged 11-19 years) with chronic diseases
were included. No restrictions were placed on study de￾sign, language, disease or participants. The year of publi￾cation was restricted by the databases we searched in:
1806-present (PsycInfo), 1900-present (Web of Science),
1980-present (CINAHL), 1946-present (Medline), and
1947-present (Embase).
Data extraction
Two independent authors extracted and processed the
data, and a consensus agreement was made. Data ex￾tracted included characteristics of the design of the tool
such as disease-specificity, number of domains, ques￾tions, responses, reporters and calculation of scores.
Evidence of the applicability of the tool, including
cohort demographics, and validity and reliability testing
was also extracted.
Analysis
Assessment of the methodological quality of the validation
studies, and the psychometric measurement qualities of
the tools was integrated using Terwee’s standardised
checklist [7]. Criterion validity was removed from analysis
as there is no gold-standard for measuring transition￾readiness, and all correlations were with theoretically
derived hypotheses (construct validity). More weight was
given to content validity, internal consistency, and con￾struct validity when making a quality assessment, as we
believe these are the most important properties for a
transition-readiness tool.
We also present a descriptive summary of selected stu￾dies including our interpretation of the potential utility
and limitations of each tool.

Results
Search results
Of the 751 results, 20 papers or abstracts on transition￾readiness tools were found. Ten validation studies were
published in peer-reviewed journals, and these were
critically appraised. Ten conference abstracts were also
found – 8 of which involved validation of a new tool, and
2 using or re-validating previously validated tools. Nume￾rous checklists were found by searching with Google,
including some listed as resources by the American con￾sensus statement [5]. The conference abstracts and gene￾ral checklists contained inadequate information to allow
formal evaluation and were subsequently excluded from
analysis.
The tools published in peer-reviewed journals were
variable in their design (listed in Table 1) and validation
(Table 2). Most tools relied on patient self-report,
and included questions on disease knowledge and self￾management. Validation by measures of independence,
knowledge, or self-management was most common. Seven
of the 10 tools were disease-specific, with the majority
directed at CF or solid organ transplantation. Most tools
scored poorly according to the Terwee criteria (See
Table 3) [7].
Disease specific tools
The Self-Care Independence Scale (SCIS) is a 44-item
carer-report questionnaire assessing the child’s ability in
and knowledge of, disease management. It was tested on
75 families who had 4-17 year olds suffering from CF with
pancreatic insufficiency [8]. The majority of children were
Caucasian, of above average intelligence and above ave￾rage socioeconomic status. This scale did not receive a
positive rating for any measure in the Terwee criteria. A
factor analysis of the scale wasn’t reported and thus its
internal consistency is indeterminate despite an excellent
Cronbach’s alpha (α = 0.93). The reproducibility of the
scale appeared good due to a test-retest correlation of
(r = 0.81), however the sample size of 35 did not meet the
minimal criteria of 50 proposed by Terwee [7]. The scale
correlated with age (r = 0.67), years since diagnosis
(r = 0.58), CF knowledge (r = 0.62), and general indepen￾dence as determined by the 21-item validated Highland
Dependency Questionnaire (r = 0.62), however the authors
did not report their hypothesis and thus the construct
validity is indeterminate. It also has a very specific cohort
and consequently, the validity of the tool in other patient
groups is uncertain [8].
Cappelli et al. developed another CF-specific question￾naire with 21 items testing disease knowledge and be￾haviour [9]. It was validated in Canada by comparing the
total readiness score with nominal caregiver ratings of
either able or not able to cope with transfer. According
to this measure, 77% of the adolescent respondents were
correctly classified by summated questionnaire scores.
Some limitations of this study are that content validation
did not involve input from adolescents, and reliability
was largely untested.
The Readiness for Transition Questionnaire (RTQ) is a
10-item tool for patients with kidney transplants. Notably,
it uses multiple reporters, has an additional question
about ‘overall transition readiness’, and also includes an
assessment of non-adherence [10]. Non-adherence is a
significant barrier to successful transition as it is thought
to be the cause of the high rates of kidney transplant
failure in adolescents and young adults [10]. The construct
validity of the RTQ was therefore assessed using the
Medical Adherence Measure. Medication adherence was
found to contribute 33% of the variance of overall tran￾sition readiness scores, suggesting that adherence is a
strong indicator of transition-readiness. However, despite
transition readiness scores increasing with age, adherence
actually decreased, raising the possibility that non-adherence
occurs independently of other aspects of transition
readiness. The RTQ also correlated with adolescent
responsibility (r = 0.68), decreased parental involvement
(r = −0.39), medication knowledge, self-refilling behaviour,
and family relationship. There was a good Cronbach’s
alpha, however internal consistency was rated as indeter￾minate due to a lack of factor analysis. Reliability was
additionally scored as indeterminate because inter-rater
reliability was tested using Pearson’s correlations (r = 0.5-0.68)
without a weighted kappa.
Adherence, measured by blood levels of immunosupres￾sants, was also used to validate the Transition Readiness
Scale (TRS) for patients with liver transplants [2]. The
authors reported psychometrics for both an adolescent and
parent version. A factor analysis was performed, however
there was wide variability in Cronbach’s alphas. Most
domains had good Cronbach’s alphas, but some scored
<0.7. Construct validity was questionable as adherence
and health outcomes did not correlate with total score. It
should be noted that measuring non-adherence is a dif￾ficult and inexact science and although frequently used,
both patient self-report and therapeutic drug monitoring
may underestimate the extent of non-adherence [11,12].
Kaugars et al. developed a 7-item questionnaire to
assess the readiness of patients with Type 1 Diabetes, and
their parents, to change the balance of responsibility of
disease management [13]. It was validated on 69 families
in the US by correlation with self-efficacy scores (r = 0.90),
decreased parental stress (r = 0.94), and responsibility. It
has good Cronbach’s alpha (α = 0.85-0.9), but factor ana￾lysis and weighted kappa were not reported. There was
poor inter-rater correlation between parent and patient
(r = 0.58) and between mother and father (r = 0.33). Fur￾thermore, it only assesses readiness to change responsi￾bility and does not assess transition-readiness directly.

Similar to the SCIS [8], the study cohort was quite
homogenous being 87% Caucasian, and 90% of parents
having a college education.
Mcpherson et al. employed a sickle cell disease-specific
questionnaire with 5 domains: knowledge, thought, interest,
difficulty, and importance of transition. Interest and know￾ledge domains correlated with age and disease severity in a
group of 70 adolescents from a single centre. Reliability,
reproducibility, and content validity were not reported, and
there was a high non-response rate of 71% [14].
The Transition Readiness Questionnaire (TRQ) is a 21-
item HIV-specific questionnaire that was administered to
patients before and after attending a transition program,
an average of 6.8 months apart. The questionnaire assesses
six variables including ability to arrange appointments,
awareness of financial factors and knowledge of disease
status and medications. Construct validity was adequate;
transition-readiness scores were found to improve with
time and were inversely related to state anxiety at baseline.
However reliability and reproducibility testing were not
reported [15]. Although there is more focus on the im￾provement of scores with transition programs than the
accuracy of the tool in predicting transition-readiness,
this study highlights a purpose of the tool in identifying
‘problem areas’ which can then be targeted by transition
programs.
Disease-neutral tools
The Self-management Skills Assessment guide is a
21-item youth and parent questionnaire. The scores
increased with general independence as assessed by the
Highland Questionnaire. Scores did not correlate with
age, gender, ethnicity, or parent education. Internal
consistency is indeterminate despite good Cronbach’s
alphas (α = 0.89-0.93) as factor analysis was not reported
[16]. As with the SCIS, it measures self-management
skills as a construct of transition-readiness, and although
this relationship is theoretically assumed, evidence supporting
it is minimal.
The Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire
(TRAQ) involves 33 questions assessing skills/actions
from 2 domains: self-management and self-advocacy,
with 5 responses adapted from the ‘Stages of Change’
model. It was validated on 192 patients at 2 sites where
the TRAQ score, as hypothesised, correlated with age,
gender, and disease groups, but not race. It has excellent
internal consistency with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.93
and was one of two studies which conducted a factor
analysis, although the sample size was arguably too small
(6 patients/item, as opposed to 7 recommended by
Terwee [7]). It was also one of two tools whose develop￾ment included a pilot on a group of adolescents, and thus
received a positive rating for content validity. Its test-retest
and inter-rater reliability were not reported [4].
Ferris et al. suggested that the TRAQ’s validity may be
impaired as it relies on self-reporting, and instead offered
the UNC TR[x]ANSITION, a tool with 33 questions
across 10 domains which can be cross-referenced with
medical records [17]. It was the only other study that
received a positive score for content validity, however
construct validity wasn’t analysed and instead inferred
from the development of the tool (interview of transition
experts and 3 pilot tests on 185 adolescents in total). The
authors did not report internal consistency by factor ana￾lysis or Cronbach’s alphas, and the inter-rater reliability
(κ = 0.71) was performed on a relatively small cohort.
The only study of transition-readiness to originate out￾side of North America was a large exploratory study of
factors that contribute to transition-readiness in Dutch
adolescents [18]. No transition-readiness assessment tool
was developed, and instead, item specific scores were
compared to each participant’s self-assessment of transi￾tion-readiness. Eleven variables significantly contribu￾ted to transition-readiness, including demographic factors
(age, gender, ethnicity), attitude towards transition, impact
of the disease, and health care self-efficacy. The main limi￾tation of the study is the reliance on self-report for
transition-readiness. The non-response rate was also notably
high (64%).
Discussion
Principal findings
This review shows that the psychometric properties of
available transition readiness tools are limited or
untested. None of the tools received positive ratings in
the most important measurement properties: content
validity, internal consistency, and construct validity. The
TRAQ was evaluated as the best tool as it had positive
scores for content and construct validity, and included a
factor analysis.
The systematic review found 2 types of tools: those
which are aimed at a specific disease type, and those
which are aimed at chronic disease in general. A disease￾specific tool negates criticism of self-report by testing
disease-specific knowledge (e.g. “demonstrate how you
would use an inhaler”) [17], however as transition issues
are common to all adolescents with chronic diseases [18],
a transition-readiness tool applicable to multiple diseases
would offer several advantages. A disease-neutral tool
enables assessment of less common diseases where tools
haven’t been developed, allows larger sample sizes, and
focuses research on a single tool.
The phrasing of questions in the UNC TR[x]ANSITION
tool (e.g. “what medications are you taking” and “explain
how you take these”) allows cross-referencing of patient
responses with medical records, and overcomes the dis￾advantage of self-report [17]. Notable features of other
tools include the use of multiple reporters to improve
Zhang et al. BMC Pediatrics 2014, 14:4 Page 8 of 10
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2431/14/4

validity (RTQ, TRS, RCBRS), the inclusion of an ‘overall
transition readiness’ question (RTQ), and the measure￾ment of adherence due to its impacts on disease outcome
and thus transition decisions. Useful domains include
involvement in skills/behaviours, disease knowledge, and
transition knowledge.
Limitations of existing studies
The criterion validity of transition-readiness tools is diffi￾cult to establish when there is no ‘gold standard’ measure
of transition readiness. Most of the tools have been vali￾dated by measures of self-efficacy, medication knowledge,
or age (which is known to be a poor measure of transition
readiness). As much of the value of a transition-readiness
tool is in its ability to time transition for optimal health
outcomes, what is necessary is a longitudinal study of the
tool’s ability to predict future transition outcomes. These
outcomes could be disease-neutral (e.g. number of hos￾pital admissions), or disease state-specific (e.g. organ func￾tion tests, number of rejection episodes).
Most of the studies evaluated also excluded patients
with cognitive impairment. Many adolescents with
chronic diseases also have general cognitive impairment
or selective learning problems and these patients may
need the most assistance with transition. A disease-neutral
tool focusing on self-report may not be practical in this
group, and they may benefit more from a disease-specific
tool which can cater to their needs (e.g. via parent report).
Further validation studies need to be conducted on these
groups and in different language groups, or other tools
developed which suit their needs.
Currently, all the validation studies originate from
USA or Canada. The validity of specific content or over￾all scores needs to be tested in culturally diverse areas
and in different health care settings. One difference in
health care provision between nations is the ability of
paediatric clinicians to continue to care for young adults.
For example, in the United Kingdom and Australia,
the licensing and funding arrangements are such that
children’s hospitals do not admit patients older than
16-18 years. Interestingly, one conference abstract found
in the search described a Canadian validation study of
the TRAQ which found that the TRAQ was not valid in
younger patients with a mean age of 15.3 years [19]. This
raises questions about the validity of these tools in a
country with a different healthcare system and different
patient mix, and supports the need for on-going vali￾dation trials.
It is worth noting that the literature search uncovered
many abstracts of recent conference presentations that
included studies of new transition readiness tools, suggest￾ing that this is a vibrant and growing area of research and
clinical practice. It should also be acknowledged that our
results are based solely on psychometric studies found in
the peer-reviewed literature. It is possible that other tools
and checklists have been validated, we did not contact the
authors of tools found in the web search.
Conclusion
There have been recent advances in the development of a
transition readiness tool, however most of these require
further validation before they can be broadly recom￾mended for clinical practice. Although disease-specific
tools predominate, disease-neutral tools have additional
advantages for research and clinical application, and focus
should be placed on conducting a longitudinal study of a
transition tool such as the TRAQ in predicting health out￾comes. A reliable and valid transition readiness tool may
dissipate some of the uncertainty around the transition
process and allow for tailoring of programs to suit the
patients’ transition needs.
