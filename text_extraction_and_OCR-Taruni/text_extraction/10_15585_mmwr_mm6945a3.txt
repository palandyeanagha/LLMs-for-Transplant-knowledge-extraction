Children Aged <18 Years During the COVID-19 Pandemic — United States, 
January 1–October 17, 2020

Published reports suggest that the coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) pandemic has had a negative effect on children’s 
mental health (1,2). Emergency departments (EDs) are often 
the first point of care for children experiencing mental health 
emergencies, particularly when other services are inacces￾sible or unavailable (3). During March 29–April 25, 2020, 
when widespread shelter-in-place orders were in effect, ED 
visits for persons of all ages declined 42% compared with the 
same period in 2019; during this time, ED visits for injury 
and non-COVID-19–related diagnoses decreased, while ED 
visits for psychosocial factors increased (4). To assess changes 
in mental health–related ED visits among U.S. children aged 
<18 years, data from CDC’s National Syndromic Surveillance 
Program (NSSP) from January 1 through October 17, 2020, 
were compared with those collected during the same period in 
2019. During weeks 1–11 (January 1–March 15, 2020), the 
average reported number of children’s mental health–related 
ED visits overall was higher in 2020 than in 2019, whereas 
the proportion of children’s mental health–related visits was 
similar. Beginning in week 12 (March 16) the number of 
mental health–related ED visits among children decreased 43% 
concurrent with the widespread implementation of COVID-19 
mitigation measures; simultaneously, the proportion of mental 
health–related ED visits increased sharply beginning in mid￾March 2020 (week 12) and continued into October (week 42) 
with increases of 24% among children aged 5–11 years and 
31% among adolescents aged 12–17 years, compared with the 
same period in 2019. The increased proportion of children’s 
mental health–related ED visits during March–October 2020 
might be artefactually inflated as a consequence of the substan￾tial decrease in overall ED visits during the same period and 
variation in the number of EDs reporting to NSSP. However, 
these findings provide initial insight into children’s mental 
health in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and high￾light the importance of continued monitoring of children’s 
mental health throughout the pandemic, ensuring access to 
care during public health crises, and improving healthy coping 
strategies and resiliency among children and families.
CDC analyzed NSSP ED visit data, which include a subset 
of hospitals in 47 states representing approximately 73% of 
U.S. ED visits.* Mental health–related ED visits among chil￾dren aged <18 years was a composite variable derived from the 
mental health syndrome query of the NSSP data for conditions 
likely to result in ED visits during and after disaster events (e.g., 
stress, anxiety, acute posttraumatic stress disorder, and panic).†
Weekly numbers of mental health–related ED visits and 
proportions of mental health–related ED visits (per 100,000 
pediatric ED visits§) were computed overall, stratified by age 
group (0–4, 5–11, and 12–17 years) and sex, and compared 
descriptively with the corresponding weekly numbers and 
proportions for 2019. Numbers and proportions of visits were 
compared during calendar weeks 1–11 (January 1–March 14, 
2020) and weeks 12–42 (March 15–October 17, 2020) (before 
and after a distinct decrease in overall ED visits reported begin￾ning in week 12 in 2020)¶ (4). Analyses are descriptive and 
statistical comparisons were not performed.
The number of children’s mental health–related ED 
visits decreased sharply from mid-March 2020 (week 12, 
March 15–21) through early April (week 15, April 5–11) and 
then increased steadily through October 2020. (Figure 1). 
During the same time, the overall proportion of reported chil￾dren’s ED visits for mental health–related concerns increased 
and remained higher through the end of the reporting period 
*The National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP) is a network developed 
and maintained by CDC, state and local health departments, and academic 
and private sector health partners to collect electronic health data in real time. 
NSSP includes ED visit data from a subset of hospitals in 47 states (all but 
Hawaii, South Dakota, and Wyoming). https://www.cdc.gov/nssp/

Definition (SD) Subcommittee community-developed syndrome definition for 
mental health conditions likely to increase in emergency department frequency 
during and after natural or human-caused disaster events. This syndrome 
definition attempts to leverage only mental health conditions and presentations 
that showed increases in visit frequency after select disasters in the United States.

only include hospitals sending diagnosis codes at patient discharge that are

average proportion of children’s mental health–related ED visits 
was approximately 44% higher in 2020 (1,673 per 100,000) 
than that in 2019 (1,161 per 100,000).
Adolescents aged 12–17 years accounted for the largest 
proportion of children’s mental health–related ED visits dur￾ing 2019 and 2020 (Figure 2). During weeks 12–42, 2020, 
the proportion of mental health–related visits for children 
aged 5–11 years and adolescents aged 12–17 years increased 
approximately 24% and 31%, respectively compared with 
those in 2019; the proportion of mental health–related visits 
for children aged 0–4 years remained similar in 2020. (Table.) 
The highest weekly proportion of mental health–related ED 
visits occurred during October for children aged 5–11 years 
(week 42; 1,177 per 100,000) and during April (week 16) for 
adolescents aged 12–17 years (4,758 per 100,000) (Figure 2).
During 2019 and 2020, the proportion of mental health–
related ED visits was higher among females aged <18 years 
than it was among males (Supplementary Figure 2, https://
stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/96610). Similar patterns of increasing 
proportions of mental health–related ED visits were observed 
in 2020 for males and females, with increases beginning mid￾March and continuing through October.
Discussion
Substantial declines in the overall reported numbers of 
children’s mental health–related ED visits occurred in 2020 
during mid-March to early May, coincident with the widespread 
implementation of community mitigation measures** enacted 
to prevent COVID-19 transmission (e.g., school closures and 
restrictions to nonemergent care) and decreases in overall ED 
visits for the same period (4). A previous report found the mean 
weekly number of ED visits for children aged <14 years declined 
approximately 70% during March 29–April 25, 2020, relative 
to the corresponding period in 2019 (4). Further, the mean 
number of weekly ED visits for persons of all ages decreased 
significantly for asthma (–10%), otitis media (–65%), and 
sprain- and strain-related injuries (–39%), and mean weekly 
ED visits for psychosocial factors increased 69% (4). This report 
demonstrates that, whereas the overall number of children’s 
mental health–related ED visits decreased, the proportion of all 
ED visits for children’s mental health–related concerns increased, 
reaching levels substantially higher beginning in late-March to

October 2020 than those during the same period during 2019. 
Describing both the number and the proportion of mental 
health–related ED visits provides crucial context for these 
findings and suggests that children’s mental health warranted 
sufficient concern to visit EDs during a time when nonemergent 
ED visits were discouraged.
Many children receive mental health services through 
clinical and community agencies, including schools (5). The 
increase in the proportion of ED visits for children’s mental 
health concerns might reflect increased pandemic-related stress 
and unintended consequences of mitigation measures, which 
reduced or modified access to children’s mental health services 
(2), and could result in increased reliance on ED services for 
both routine and crisis treatment (3). However, the magnitude 
of the increase should be interpreted carefully because it might 
also reflect the large decrease in the number and proportion 
of other types of ED visits (e.g., asthma, otitis media, and 
musculoskeletal injuries) (4) and variation in the number of 
EDs reporting to NSSP.
Adolescents aged 12–17 years accounted for the highest 
proportion of mental health–related ED visits in both 2019 
and 2020, followed by children aged 5–11 years. Many mental 
disorders commence in childhood, and mental health concerns 
in these age groups might be exacerbated by stress related to 
the pandemic and abrupt disruptions to daily life associated 
with mitigation efforts, including anxiety about illness, social 
isolation, and interrupted connectedness to school (5). The 
majority of EDs lack adequate capacity to treat pediatric 
mental health concerns (6), potentially increasing demand on 
systems already stressed by the COVID-19 pandemic. These 
findings demonstrate continued need for mental health care 
for children during the pandemic and highlight the importance 
of expanding mental health services, such as telemental health 
and technology-based solutions (e.g., mobile mental health 
applications) (5,7).
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limita￾tions. First, the proportions presented should be interpreted 
with caution because of variations affecting the denominators 
used to calculate proportions. Children’s mental health–related 
ED visits constitute a small percentage of all pediatric ED visits 
(1.1% in 2019 and 1.4% in 2020), increasing susceptibility of 
rates to decreases in ED visits during the pandemic. In addi￾tion, NSSP ED participation can vary over time; however, 
analyzing number of visits and proportion of total ED visits 
provides context for observed variation. Second, NSSP data 
are not nationally representative; these findings might not be 
generalizable beyond those EDs participating in NSSP. Further, 
usable information on race and ethnicity was not available in 
the NSSP data. Finally, these data are subject to under- and 
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Emergency departments (EDs) are often the first point of care 
for children’s mental health emergencies. U.S. ED visits for 
persons of all ages declined during the early COVID-19 
pandemic (March–April 2020).
What is added by this report?
Beginning in April 2020, the proportion of children’s mental 
health–related ED visits among all pediatric ED visits increased 
and remained elevated through October. Compared with 2019, 
the proportion of mental health–related visits for children 
aged 5–11 and 12–17 years increased approximately 24%. and 
31%, respectively.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Monitoring indicators of children’s mental health, promoting 
coping and resilience, and expanding access to services to 
support children’s mental health are critical during the 
COVID-19 pandemic.
overestimation. Variation in reporting and coding practices can 
influence the number and proportion of mental health–related 
visits observed. ED visits represent unique events, not indi￾vidual persons, and as such, might reflect multiple visits for one 
person. The definition of mental health focuses on symptoms 
and conditions (e.g., stress, anxiety) that might increase after 
a disaster in the United States and might not reflect all mental 
health–related ED visits. Still, these data likely underestimate 
the actual number of mental health–related health care visits 
because many mental health visits occur outside of EDs.
Children’s mental health during public health emergencies 
can have both short- and long-term consequences to their 
overall health and well-being (8). This report provides timely 
surveillance data concerning children’s mental health in the 
context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ongoing collection 
of a broad range of children’s mental health data outside the 
ED is needed to monitor the impact of COVID-19 and the 
effects of public health emergencies on children’s mental health. 
Ensuring availability of and access to developmentally appro￾priate mental health services for children outside the in-person 
ED setting will be important as communities adjust mitigation 
strategies (3). Implementation of technology-based, remote 
mental health services and prevention activities to enhance 
healthy coping and resilience in children might effectively sup￾port their well-being throughout response and recovery periods 
(5,7). CDC supports efforts to promote the emotional well￾being of children and families and provides developmentally 
appropriate resources for families to reduce stressors that might 
contribute to children’s mental health–related ED visits†† (9).
