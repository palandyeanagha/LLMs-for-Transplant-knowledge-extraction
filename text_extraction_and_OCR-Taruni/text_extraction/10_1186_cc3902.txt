Abstract
Introduction To review systematically the effect of interventions
aimed at hemodynamic optimization and to relate this to the
quality of individual published trials.
Methods A systematic, computerized bibliographic search of
published studies and citation reviews of relevant studies was
performed. All randomized clinical trials in which adult patients
were included in a trial deliberately aiming at an optimized or
maximized hemodynamic condition of the patients (with oxygen
delivery, cardiac index, oxygen consumption, mixed venous
oxygen saturation and/or stroke volume as end-points) were
selected. A total of 30 studies were selected for independent
review. Two reviewers extracted data on population,
intervention, outcome and methodological quality. Agreement
between reviewers was high: differences were eventually
resolved by third-party decision. The methodological quality of
the studies was moderate (mean 9.0, SD 1.7), and the
outcomes of the randomized clinical trials were not related to
their quality.
Results Efforts to achieve an optimized hemodynamic condition
resulted in a decreased mortality rate (relative risk ratio (RR)
0.75 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.90) in all studies
combined. This was due to a significantly decreased mortality in
peri-operative intervention studies (RR 0.66 (95% CI 0.54 to
0.81). Overall, patients with sepsis and overt organ failure do
not benefit from this method (RR 0.92 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.11)).
Conclusion This systematic review showed that interventions
aimed at hemodynamic optimization reduced mortality. In
particular, trials including peri-operative interventions aimed at
the hemodynamic optimization of high-risk surgical patients
reduce mortality. Overall, this effect was not related to the trial
quality.
Introduction
It has been shown that, in critically ill patients, impaired cardi￾ovascular function has a role in the development of organ fail￾ure. Our understanding of the underlying mechanism
responsible for this dysfunction has changed over the past 10
years. Previously, correction of disturbed hemodynamics to
normal values in the peri-operative phase was considered
standard care in the treatment of surgical patients. However,
clinical signs of hypovolemia are non-specific and non-sensi￾tive [1]. Moreover, because the mean values of commonly
used parameters, such as central venous pressure and pulmo￾nary artery occlusion pressure, are similar between survivors
and non-survivors, the value of correcting these parameters to
normal values is questionable [2]. The same is true for critically
ill patients treated for sepsis at an intensive care unit [1].
A report by Shoemaker and colleagues [3] changed the pre￾vailing views on the hemodynamic treatment of the critically ill
patient. In this report the authors observed that 'normal' values
are 'abnormal' in post-operative, trauma and critically ill
patients. In comparison with non-surviving patients, surviving
trauma patients had above-normal oxygen delivery and oxygen
consumption values. These 'supra-normal' values may reflect
an ability of these patients to respond adequately to the
'stress' of the trauma.
There have been a considerable number of randomized, con￾trolled, clinical studies investigating the role of improving
patients' hemodynamic condition by increasing oxygen deliv￾ery to the tissues to supranormal levels or by other goals. Hey￾land and colleagues published a review in 1996 evaluating
studies that included patients for whom supranormal oxygen

delivery was the goal of treatment [4]. This review, including a
total of 1,291 patients, found no difference in outcome but
identified a relation between outcome and trial quality [4]. In
two recent meta-analyses, Kern and Shoemaker [5] and Boyd
and Hayes [6] found a significant reduction in mortality, but
they did not report data on quality analysis.
We therefore decided to perform a systematic review of the
effects of interventions aimed at hemodynamic optimization
and to examine their relation to the quality of the individual pub￾lished trials. We hypothesized that a reduced trial quality
would be related to a greater reported survival difference.
Materials and methods
Study identification
Three methods were used to retrieve information for this
review [7,8]. First, MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for the
years 1980 to 2005 were searched, with the following mesh
headings: 'oxygen consumption' or 'hemodynamics' or 'dob￾utamine' or 'fluid therapy', exploding with 'randomized control￾led trials' (publication type) and 'intensive care', 'critical care'
or 'intensive care unit' or 'surgery' or 'peri-operative care'. The
second method used was to search personal files and commu￾nications to find additional citations and to search Current
Contents for recently published studies. Third, the reference
lists of the articles found with the above-mentioned methods
were searched for additional articles.
Study selection
The articles found using this search method were classified
into original articles, reviews and others (such as letters).
Studies were selected if they involved a randomized controlled
trial with fluid and/or additional vasoactive therapy to optimize
or maximize the hemodynamic condition of the patients (end￾points: oxygen delivery, cardiac index, oxygen consumption,
mixed venous oxygen saturation and/or stroke volume). More￾over, the studies included had to have been performed either
among an adult intensive care unit population or an adult sur￾gical population. Studies with zero mortality in both treatment
arms were not excluded from the meta-analysis.
Methodological quality assessment
A methodological scoring system (Table 1) was used to give a
relative assessment of the quality of the primarily selected
studies [9]. The scoring system was based on the system pro￾posed and validated by Chalmers [9] and previously used by
Heyland and colleagues [4]. The scores for the individual stud￾ies were compared between two independent observers, and
in the event of disagreement a third (non-involved) person
decided on the score assigned to the study. Because not all
studies aimed at the reduction of mortality as a primary end￾point, a scoring distinction was made between studies aiming
primarily at reducing mortality (two points) and those having a
reduced mortality as a secondary end-point (one point). The
presence of crossover is defined as a patient achieving the
hemodynamic goals of the opposite group from that to which
he or she had been allocated (that is, a patient in the control

group achieving the oxygen delivery goal defined for the treat￾ment group, without additional treatment).
Statistical analysis
Data are shown as percentages or absolute numbers ± SD. A
statistical meta-analysis was performed with Review Manager
4.2. The primary outcome was the overall mortality rate
reported at 28 to 30 days. The relative risk ratios for the indi￾vidual studies and the overall relative risk ratios with 95% con￾fidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by means of the
method developed by Mantel and Haenszel. To assess the
heterogeneity between studies, we used the method devel￾oped by DerSimonian and Laird [10]. If no significant hetero￾geneity was found, a fixed-effects model was used to calculate
pooled relative risk and 95% CIs.
Several subset analyses were performed. One subset analysis
compared the results for 'peri-operative' and 'sepsis' patients
included in the various studies. The two patient groups (peri￾operative patients and patients with sepsis and organ failure)
were separated by using the inclusion criteria from the original
studies, based on pathophysiological differences [11]. This
subset therefore differentiates between the effects of optimi￾zation techniques in peri-operative patients and in patients
with organ failure or sepsis and organ failure. The hypothesis
tested in this subset analysis was that hemodynamic optimiza￾tion to values above normal improves the outcome in peri￾operative patients (including post-traumatic patients), but has
no effect in patients with sepsis and organ failure.
A second subset analysis included the studies using the orig￾inal 'supranormal' hemodynamic optimization criteria proposed
by Shoemaker and colleagues (that is, cardiac index > 4.5 l
min-1 m-2, oxygen delivery > 600 ml min-1 m-2 or oxygen con￾sumption (VO2) > 170 ml min-1 m-2) [3,12-28]. The other stud￾ies used a variety of therapeutic goals, including mixed venous
oxygen saturation (SvO2) [22,29-31], left-ventricle stroke work
index [32], stroke volume [33,34], or cardiac index values
lower than 4.5 l min-1 m-2 [35-40]. For the purpose of this sub￾set analysis, the study by Gattinoni and colleagues [22] was
divided into two datasets. One included the patients for whom
cardiac index was the goal of treatment. This dataset was
included in the subset of studies using the original criteria pro￾posed by Shoemaker and colleagues [3]. The patients for
whom SvO2 was the goal of treatment were included in the
other study subset.
In addition, subset analyses were conducted to investigate the
effects of the methodological quality criteria. One subset anal￾ysis compared studies having a quality score above 10, indi￾cating adequate trial quality, with those having a quality score
below 10. This cutoff value for the methodological quality was
determined from the peak incidence of quality scores. Finally,
the individual quality items of using the presence of mortality
as an end-point, blinding and crossover were tested sepa￾rately in a subset analysis.
Results
Study inclusion and allocation
After initial screening and a subsequent more detailed evalua￾tion of retrieved randomized trial reports, 32 candidate trials
were identified. A total of 30 studies were included in the anal￾ysis. Two studies were omitted from the analysis after careful
review of the methodology: the study by Garrison and col￾leagues [41] was a case-control study, and the study by Blow
and colleagues [42] used no randomization. Of the 30 remain￾ing trials, 21 involved surgery or trauma patients who were
hemodynamically optimized peri-operatively, and 9 involved
patients with sepsis and/or organ failure.
Study results
The total number of patients included in the studies was
5,733. The median number of patients who were randomized
was 75 (range 30 to 1,994; Tables 2 and 3). The mean score
on the methodological quality assessment in the included
studies was 9.1 (95% CI 7 to 12.7), which is 57% of the max￾imum score of 16. The duration of follow-up, up to 28 or 30
days, was specified in all trials. Other characteristics of the tri￾als are shown in Tables 2 and 3.
The odds ratio for all studies combined was 0.61 (95% CI
0.46 to 0.81) with a relative risk of 0.75 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.90;
Figure 1). However, the absolute risk reduction was only 0.4%
(95% CI -1.7 to 2.6%). Moreover, of the 30 studies included,
only 8 showed a significantly greater survival in the optimized
patients, whereas one study showed a significantly greater
mortality in the optimized patient group, and the other studies
did not show a significant difference in survival. For quality
control, we correlated the score of the quality assessment with
the odds ratio for the individual studies. This correlation was
not significant (r = 0.33; p = 0.07).
Subset analysis
Peri-operative and trauma studies versus studies using 
septic/organ failure patients
There were 4,174 patients enrolled in the studies that used
strategies to optimize the hemodynamic condition peri-opera￾tively and during trauma (Table 2). The overall odds ratio for
mortality with hemodynamic optimization in this group was
0.43 (95% CI 0.28 to 0.66) with a relative risk ratio of 0.66
(95% CI 0.54 to 0.81; Figure 1). Of the 21 studies, 6 showed
a significantly reduced mortality in the treatment group. When
using an optimization protocol, 31 patients (95% CI 20 to 63)
had to be treated to save one life. The number of patients that
must be included in a single study to be able to find this
difference is 500, assuming a mortality rate of 15% in the con￾trol group.

The overall odds ratio for the 1,558 enrolled patients with sep￾tic shock/organ failure was 0.85 (95% CI 0.58 to 1.25) with a
relative risk ratio of 0.92 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.11; Figure 1 and
Table 3). Of the 10 included studies, 3 found either a tendency
towards increased mortality or a significantly increased mortal￾ity in the treated patients. Two studies found an improved
survival.
The mean quality score for the peri-operative studies did not
differ from the mean score for the studies of septic/organ fail￾ure patients (9.0 ± 1.9 versus 9.0 ± 1.3; p = 0.9). Neither the
peri-operative studies nor the studies including patients with
sepsis had a significant correlation between the score and the
odds ratio (r = 0.28, p = 0.3, and r = 0.28, p = 0.4,
respectively).
Supranormal oxygen delivery as a goal of treatment
Our analysis for all studies combined, but only including those
patients optimized by using the criteria proposed by Shoe￾maker (total number of included patients; n = 2,181), yielded
an odds ratio of 0.60 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.88), with a relative risk
ratio of 0.75 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.95). This significant effect was
not found in the patient group for whom supranormal oxygen
delivery was not used as the end-point (relative risk ratio 0.81
(95% CI 0.62 to 1.07); Table 4).
The subgroup analysis of the peri-operative studies that
included individual studies using the original criteria proposed
by Shoemaker (with 1,142 patients) found a relative risk ratio
of 0.41 (0.29 to 0.59; Table 4). In these studies, 10 patients
(95% CI 7 to 16) needed to be treated to save one life. The
quality control score of this subgroup was 9.1 (SD 2.5). Stud￾ies using treatment goals other than supranormal oxygen deliv￾ery in peri-operative patients found no effect on mortality; the
relative risk ratio was 0.84 (0.64 to 1.10).
In the studies including patients with sepsis and organ failure,
neither the use of supranormal oxygen delivery nor other spec￾ified treatment goals yielded a reduction in mortality; relative
risk ratios were 1.00 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.11) and 0.93 (95% CI
0.83 to 1.05), respectively (Table 4).
Quality assessment score
Studies with a high quality assessment (a score of 10 or more)
tended to report a higher relative risk ratio, although the differ￾ence was not significant (mean 0.84; 95% CI 0.66 to 1.07)
than studies with a lower quality assessment score (mean
0.60; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.75; Table 4). In the subset of studies
including peri-operative and trauma patients, the overall out￾come was not related to the trial quality. The studies with a
quality score of 10 or more found a relative risk ratio of 0.60
(95% CI 0.38 to 0.95), compared with a relative risk ratio of

0.27 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.55) in the studies with a quality score
of less than 10. Other cutoff points were also tested but pro￾duced similar results (data not shown).
Mortality end-point
Relative risk ratios were calculated for 29 of the 30 included
studies. In the combined studies that had mortality as the pri￾mary end-point, the effect on mortality tended to be lower than
that in the remaining studies, although the difference was not
significant (Table 4).
Blinding
Only three studies (10%) randomized patients with adequate
blinding. The effect on mortality was not significantly different
in studies with inadequate blinding from that found in the stud￾ies without blinding (Table 4).
Crossover
In the studies in which crossover between the treatment arms
was adequately controlled for, no significant effect on mortality
was found in comparison with the studies with significant
crossover (Table 4).
Discussion
This meta-analysis, for which we conducted a systematic
search, selection and quality assessment of the literature, sug￾gests that optimization techniques can improve survival when
used in peri-operative and trauma patients without sepsis or
multiple organ failure. Overall, patients with sepsis and overt
organ failure do not benefit from this method.
The use of hemodynamic optimization as a therapy to improve
outcome is controversial. The regimen was originally designed
to optimize the hemodynamic status in high-risk surgical

both in all trials included, in peri-operative trials, and in studies including patients with sepsis and established organ failure. Risk analysis was also 
calculated in the subgroup of studies with a quality assessment score of 10 or more, comparing them with the studies with a quality assessment 
score of less than 10. Individual quality assessment items were also analysed for risk reduction, including the use of mortality as primary end-point 
in the studies, the use of adequate blinding, and the presence of crossover phenomena. A fixed-effects model for calculating the odds ratio and 
relative risk ratio was used when heterogeneity analysis (last column) was not significant. 95% CI, 95% confidence interval; DO2, oxygen delivery;

patients. The initial studies found an improved outcome,
although doubt remained about the methodological quality of
these studies. A large number of studies, using different
patient populations and optimization techniques, were subse￾quently conducted. A considerable number of these studies
found no improved outcome [14,16,22]. Moreover, one study
found an increased mortality rate in the optimized patient
group [20]. The meta-analysis by Heyland and colleagues [4],
reporting the first seven studies published at that time, found
no overall benefit from maximizing oxygen delivery with the aim
of improving outcome. This meta-analysis also criticized the
quality of the individual studies. A subsequent meta-analysis
by Kern and Shoemaker found a significantly lower mortality in
patient groups optimized at an early stage (namely surgical
patients optimized peri-operatively), but no formal quality anal￾ysis was presented [5]. Our meta-analysis represents the most
up-to-date evaluation of the issue of hemodynamic optimiza￾tion in which a quality assessment was performed and related
to the outcome of the studies. It suggests that hemodynamic
optimization strategies are beneficial in all patient subgroups
but that the overall effect is explained by the significant
improvement in mortality in those studies including peri-opera￾tive and trauma patients.
There are several critical issues to be addressed before valid
conclusions can be drawn from the present meta-analysis. The
overall trial quality has been called into question previously [4]
and we found in our meta-analysis that studies with a high trial
quality score (using the cutoff point of 10 out of 16) did not
report an improved mortality rate. Fortunately, the trial quality
seemed to influence the outcome in the studies including peri￾operative patients less than the outcome in the subset of
patients with established sepsis and multiple organ failure. In
addition, the largest effect on mortality was found in the stud￾ies including peri-operative patients.
Another critical point may be the cutoff point that we chose to
divide the individual studies between those with a high quality
score and those with a low score. However, other cutoff points
that we tested produced similar data (data not shown). More￾over, we also tested the effect of individual trial quality features
on the outcome of the studies included. Thus, although the
overall trial quality is moderate it may be concluded that the
impact of this on the outcome of the meta-analysis is not
significant.

One may question our subset analysis, which divided the stud￾ies into a subset with studies involving peri-operative and
trauma patients and one with studies using septic/organ fail￾ure patients. It has been suggested, both in reviews [43,44]
and in a previous meta-analysis [6], that the outcome of stud￾ies with late interventions should be separated from those of
studies with early interventions. A similar distinction was made
in the meta-analysis by Heyland and colleagues [4]. In addi￾tion, in the meta-analysis by Kern and Shoemaker [5] risk dif￾ferences (-0.23 ± 0.07) in the subgroup using goals to
supranormal values in patients before organ failure were found
comparable to the data reported in our study (risk difference -
0.12; 95% CI -0.20 to -0.03). Recent publications have
indeed reported a pathophysiological basis for this distinction.
In an early stage of the disease process of the systemic inflam￾matory response syndrome, it is possible to prevent or over￾come peripheral defects in oxygen delivery, on the basis of
decreased flow, hypoxia or hypovolemia. In contrast, persist￾ent defects in oxygen delivery to the tissues during decreased
flow or hypovolemia may alter vascular and cellular
metabolism. These defects in cellular oxygenation become
irreversible as a result of mitochondrial damage, and when
they occur in the endothelium they lead to vascular hyporeac￾tivity or 'vasoplegia', resulting in impaired perfusion and organ
failure. Moreover, organ function is less likely to recover at this
stage because of the relative insensitivity of patients with mul￾tiple organ failure to the optimization techniques [11,45,46].
The study by Rivers and colleagues [30], in which early optimi￾zation of the hemodynamics led to a reduced mortality even in
patients with early septic shock, underlines this point.
The studies in our meta-analysis included different patient
groups with varying co-morbidities and expected mortality
rates. The differentiation between the patients included in early
and late intervention studies partly compensates for this effect.
Some studies had a lower statistical power than expected,
because of the low mortality rate in control patients. In the
study by Takala and colleagues [15], no survival benefit was
found in the overall study group, which had low baseline mor￾tality, but a survival benefit was detected in a subgroup with
higher baseline mortality (namely emergency surgery).
Conclusion
There is sufficient evidence that aiming for optimized oxygen
transport values in patients with high-risk surgery or trauma is
beneficial and that the trial quality, although overall only mod￾erate, is not important in these patients. The promising results
obtained by Rivers and colleagues [30] and the aggressive
early optimization of sepsis deserves further investigation and
confirmation. However, patients with established organ failure
due to sepsis do not benefit from attempts to optimize oxygen
transport values.

Key messages
• Peri-operative interventions aimed at the hemodynamic 
optimization of high-risk surgical patients reduce 
mortality.
• The use of hemodynamic optimization as a therapy to 
improve outcome during sepsis with established organ 
failure does not reduce mortality.
• Although there is no clear relationship between overall 
trial quality and outcome of all trials, individual quality 
assessment items influenced study outcome.
