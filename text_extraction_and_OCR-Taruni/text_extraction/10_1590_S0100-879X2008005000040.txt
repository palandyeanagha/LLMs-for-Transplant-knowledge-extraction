A major problem in renal transplantation is identifying a grading system that can predict long-term graft survival. The present
study determined the extent to which the two existing grading systems (Banff 97 and chronic allograft damage index, CADI)
correlate with each other and with graft loss. A total of 161 transplant patient biopsies with chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN)
were studied. The samples were coded and evaluated blindly by two pathologists using the two grading systems. Logistic
regression analyses were used to evaluate the best predictor index for renal allograft loss. Patients with higher Banff 97 and
CADI scores had higher rates of graft loss. Moreover, these measures also correlated with worse renal function and higher
proteinuria levels at the time of CAN diagnosis. Logistic regression analyses showed that the use of angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), hepatitis C virus (HCV), tubular atrophy, and the use of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) were associated
with graft loss in the CADI, while the use of ACEI, HCV, moderate interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy and the use of MMF were
associated in the Banff 97 index. Although Banff 97 and CADI analyze different parameters in different renal compartments, only
some isolated parameters correlated with graft loss. This suggests that we need to review the CAN grading systems in order to
devise a system that includes all parameters able to predict long-term graft survival, including chronic glomerulopathy,
glomerular sclerosis, vascular changes, and severity of chronic interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy.

Introduction
Chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) is present in 40-
60% of allograft biopsies 24 months post-transplantation,
and represents the most common cause of late renal graft
failure (1,2). CAN is characterized by progressive deterio￾ration of renal function produced by sclerotic changes
affecting blood vessels, glomeruli, interstitium, and tu￾bules. However, it is graded only by the degree of damage
to the last two parameters, interstitium and tubules (3).
Although the Banff 97 classification (4) has become an
international standard for evaluating renal allograft biop-

sies and the presence of chronic lesions with correlation
with allograft outcome (5-9), there is another classification
used to evaluate renal allograft biopsies: the chronic al￾lograft damage index (CADI) (10). Recently, CADI was
validated in a multicenter study as a surrogate end point for
long-term graft function (11). Currently, either Banff 97 or
CADI classifications is used to quantify renal allograft
damage because they are both useful for predicting renal
graft outcome (5,9,11,12).
The objective of this study was to determine which of
these classifications is the best grading system for predict￾ing loss of graft function due to chronic allograft nephropa￾thy. Furthermore, we also evaluated the independent fac￾tors associated with graft loss within both grading systems.
Subjects and Methods
A total of 1990 consecutive biopsies of deceased and
living-donor kidney transplant patients performed at the
Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP) between 2000
and 2003, with at least 6 months of graft function, were
reviewed retrospectively. A total of 450 biopsies with a
proven diagnosis of CAN was initially identified. Biopsies
were excluded from the study if the patients 1) were recipi￾ents of a previous organ transplant, 2) were currently
receiving a multiorgan transplant, 3) had a high immuno￾logical risk at the time of transplantation, defined as having
a previously measured panel-reactive antibody grade of
>60%, 4) had de novo post-transplant glomerulonephritis
or post-transplantation glomerulonephritis without known
primary etiology of chronic renal disease, or 5) had tumors
after transplantation. Finally, we included and re-reviewed
161 transplant patient biopsies with chronic allograft ne￾phropathy in this cohort. The Ethics Committee on Human
Research of our Institution (UNIFESP) reviewed and ap￾proved this study.
Operational definition
Delayed graft function was defined as the requirement
for dialysis during the first week after transplantation with￾out rejection and/or technical problems. Acute rejection
was defined as when patients with graft dysfunction pre￾sented a biopsy with matched Banff 97 criteria or when the
dysfunction resolved after a minimum of 3 doses of
methylprednisone over 3 days in the absence of other
causes of dysfunction. Any rejection before the 3rd month
of transplantation was classified as early acute rejection,
while rejection after this period was considered late rejec￾tion. Systemic arterial hypertension was defined as re￾peated elevated blood pressure exceeding 140/90 mmHg
or when patients were using at least one anti-hypertensive
drug. New onset of diabetes after transplantation (NODAT)
was defined as when fasting plasma glucose was ≥126
mg/dL (≥7 mmol/L), with random blood sugar level ≥200
mg/dL (≥11.1 mmol/L) accompanied by symptoms, or oral
glucose tolerance test ≥200 mg/dL. Renal function was
measured by serum creatinine and by creatinine clear￾ance and calculated using the Cockroft-Gault equation.
Histological analyses
At least four stained slides were used for quantification of
histological changes in each biopsy, one stained with hema￾toxylin-eosin, one with Masson’s trichrome, one with peri￾odic acid-Schiff and one with silver stain. All sections had
more than 5 glomeruli per slide. All biopsy specimens were
reviewed by two independent pathologists, using both grad￾ing systems on each biopsy, before inclusion in the study.
Biopsy specimens of all cases were evaluated and
graded according to the Banff 97 criteria (8) and CADI
(10,11). CAN was subdivided into three grades according
to the Banff 97 classification that evaluates and/or grades
the severity of chronic allograft nephropathy based on the
evaluation of tubular and interstitial parameters to mini￾mize sampling error problems (4). Grade I (mild) is charac￾terized by mild interstitial fibrosis, grade II (moderate)
corresponds to moderate interstitial fibrosis and tubular
atrophy, and grade III (severe) corresponds to severe
interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy and tubular loss.
The CADI score is based on individual component scores
for a) diffuse or focal inflammation, b) fibrosis in the intersti￾tium, c) increase in mesangial matrix, d) sclerosis in glo￾meruli, e) intimal proliferation, and f) tubular atrophy. Each
individual parameter is scored from 0 to 3 as described in the
literature (10,11). To determine the predictive value of the
CADI score for graft loss, we divided the patients into three
groups: those with CADI less than 2, those with CADI
between 2 and 3.9, and those with CADI equal to or greater
than 4, as described by Yilmaz et al. (11).
The kappa index was used to assess inter-rater reli￾ability when observing or coding qualitative/categorical
variables (kappa >0.70 was considered satisfactory). The
kappa index was = 0.85 (95%CI: 0.75-0.95), and observed
agreement = 0.90. The result of the severity of acute and
chronic lesions in each renal compartment was calculated
by applying concordance criteria among these observers.
In the event of discrepancy between the two pathologists,
the mean value of the variables was used as the final grade
of lesion severity.
Statistical analyses
Pre-transplant demographic characteristics used for
covariate-adjusted analyses included dialysis therapy (he-

modialysis vs peritoneal dialysis), source of the graft (de￾ceased vs living donor), anti-HCV antibodies and anti￾hepatitis B virus serology. The post-transplant related
variables included the presence of delayed graft function,
early and late acute rejection, cytomegalovirus antigen￾emia, NODAT, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme in￾hibitor (ACEI), and use of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF).
The presence of proteinuria was recorded as a numerical
variable in grams per day and serum creatinine and creati￾nine clearance were measured at the time of biopsy as well
as at follow-up. Chi-square and Fisher exact tests were
performed to compare demographic covariates between
groups, when appropriate. The Spearman correlation co￾efficient (rs) was used to study the relationship between
ordinal data or non-normally distributed quantitative data
(quantitative clinical variables and histological parameters).
One-way ANOVA (and subsequently Bonferroni post hoc
test) was used to compare variables among three different
Banff 97 and CADI grades.
Data are reported as mean ± standard deviation and as
median and range, when appropriate. A P value of less
than 0.05 was considered to be significant. A multivariate,
logistic regression model was used to analyze the relation￾ship between the graft loss and the other covariates,
including those that were significant in univariate analysis
or those variables we considered to be clinically relevant,
including immunosuppressive drugs (the use of MMF after
CAN diagnosis) and the time of transplantation. Two logis￾tic regression models were built, one model included Banff
97 (also categorized as above grade 2) classification and
its histological parameters while another included CADI
(also categorized as above 2.3) and its histological param￾eters. A logistic regression model (backward step) was
used to obtain the final model of significant predictors;
confounding variables were analyzed when required. There
was no confounding when the exponential coefficient (HR)
did not change more than 10%. Statistical software SPSS
12.0 (USA) was used for all statistical analyses.
Results
Demographic analyses of the enrolled population
The study population was divided into two groups: with
graft loss (N = 29) and without graft loss (N = 132).
Demographic characteristics and immunosuppressive treat￾ment (intention to treat) are summarized in Table 1. The
time of transplant was 57 ± 29 months (range 6-130
months) and the mean follow-up after CAN diagnosis was
29 ± 20 months (range 10-56 months). During this period,
29 grafts were lost at 58 ± 34 months (range 15-134
months) after grafting (Table 1).
Considering the stratification, the patients who lost
grafts had more HCV- or HBV-positive serologies (P =
0.011), higher serum creatinine at 12 months post-trans￾plant (P = 0.039), and used less ACEI (P = 0.000, Table 1).
Subsequently, we examined the groups according to Banff
97 and CADI grading together with renal function at the
time of the graft biopsy. As expected, patients with higher
Banff 97 and CADI scores presented higher rates of graft
lost, higher proteinuria and serum creatinine, although
creatinine clearance as assessed by Cockroft-Gault for￾mula was similar (Table 2).
To better investigate this relationship, we re-analyzed
these data taking into consideration the three grades of
Banff 97 and three scores of CADI. Once more, there was
a statistically significant trend toward worse renal function
in those patients with higher grades (Banff 97 grade III and
CADI >4). The age of transplant at biopsy was higher in
Banff 97 grade III and CADI >4. Patients with Banff 97
grade I and CADI <2 lost fewer grafts (9 and 7%, respec￾tively) than the other groups (Table 3).
Relationship between CADI and Banff 97 scores and
their correlation with renal function
The CADI correlated with tubular atrophy (rs = 0.655, P
= 0.000), interstitial fibrosis (rs = 0.657, P = 0.000), vascu￾lar fibrosis intimal thickening (rs = 0.497, P = 0.000) and
with mesangial matrix increase (rs = 0.609, P = 0.000). The
Banff 97 grade correlated with glomerular sclerosis (rs =
0.216, P = 0.006), interstitial fibrosis (rs = 0.664, P = 0.000)
and tubular atrophy (rs = 0.651, P = 0.000). There was also
correlation between the CADI histological parameters and
Banff 97 scores as reported in Table 4.
The CADI and Banff 97 scores correlated with serum
creatinine and creatinine clearance at the time of biopsy.
Interestingly, 24-h proteinuria at the time of biopsy only
correlated with CADI; however, the correlation was weak (r
= 0.296, P = 0.01). Serum creatinine or creatinine clear￾ance levels at 0, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months after
transplantation did not correlate with any histological pa￾rameter (data not shown).
Multivariate analyses
Two models were employed for multivariate analyses
using logistic regression: one with Banff 97 parameters
and the other with CADI parameters. With the first model,
we observed that the use of ACEI (HR = 0.309, P = 0.011),
positive hepatitis C serology (HR = 3.788, P = 0.010), the
use of MMF (HR = 0.304, P = 0.007), and moderate
interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (grade ≥2; HR =
2.946, P = 0.014) were associated with graft loss. Similarly,
in the model that included the CADI and its histological

Discussion
A major problem in renal trans￾plantation is identifying reliable early
morphological changes that can help
predict renal allograft outcome. Acute
and chronic tissue damage can be
semi-quantified by the Banff 97 clas￾sification, while CADI provides infor￾mation about chronic injury. The Banff
97 schema grades the severity of
chronic allograft nephropathy based
on tubular and interstitial parameters
(4). The CADI index is more exten￾sive regarding the number of param￾eters, also taking into account vascu￾lar and glomerular changes, which
are evaluated differently. Moreover,
the Banff 97 classification does not
take into consideration glomeruloscle￾rosis, while CADI cannot evaluate ar￾teriolar hyalinosis and chronic glo￾merulopathy. Thus, although both sys￾tems are used for the same purpose,
they actually look at the tissue differ￾ently, and possibly make different as￾sumptions for the graft outcome.
The present study investigated
whether the Banff 97 and CADI clas￾sifications correlated well with each
other, even though they evaluate le￾sions in different renal compartments,
and also whether they can both pre￾dict graft loss in patients with chronic
allograft nephropathy.
The CADI correlated with graft
function at the moment of biopsy as
did the Banff 97 classification. These
findings were consistent with other
published studies (5-7,9,10). How￾ever, extending these studies, we
observed that the systems had some
limitations in predicting renal graft loss
when they were considered as whole
scores. When all histological variables
associated with renal function were
considered, tubular atrophy and in-

terstitial fibrosis were identified as independent predictors
of renal graft loss.
These data confirmed the findings described by
Nankivell et al. (13) in which interstitial fibrosis showed an
adverse impact on graft outcome (13-17). Furthermore,
interstitial fibrosis is a common finding in other chronic
kidney diseases besides chronic allograft nephropathy
(13), having strong correlation with tubular atrophy and
graft loss (13,18). According to published reports (18-21),
chronic interstitial fibrosis can develop after primary tubu￾lar injury, resulting in alteration in tubular phenotype with
production of chemoattractant for monocyte/macrophages
(22). The non-specific mononuclear inflammation around
and within atrophied tubules in native kidney may essen￾tially reflect an immune response that may trigger fibrosis,
a process to which tubular cells may actively contribute.
Conversely, inflammation in the interstitium with capillary
injury may lead to ischemia with tubular atrophy and fibro￾sis. Nankivell and colleagues (23) reported that the same
process occurred in renal allograft, whereby the interstitial
fibrosis and tubular atrophy scores are increased due to
subclinical immune-mediated injury and nephrotoxicity.
Glomerulosclerosis was not a predictor for graft loss,
perhaps because, in the present study, there were patients
who lost the graft without having significant glomeruloscle￾rosis at the time of biopsy (lower transplantation time could
be implicated in less glomeruli lesion), and possibly be￾cause those with any suspicion of glomerulopathy were
excluded. This result correlates, in part, with the literature
(3,13,15), where glomerulosclerosis could result from in￾terstitial fibrosis, with development of periglomerular fibro￾sis and atubular glomeruli, or from a high degree of arteri￾olar damage leading to ischemic glomeruli.
In the present study, the use of ACEI therapy had a
protective role on graft loss. In many animal models and
some clinical studies (24-27), such protection has already
been established. An experimental study by the Remuzzi
group (26) showed that ACEI therapy could indeed sus￾pend proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis development, in￾terrupting the progression of chronic allograft dysfunction
in rodents.
In the multivariate analyses, some classical variables
were not associated with graft loss while others corrobo￾rated data from the literature. Moreso and colleagues (28)
have already shown that HCV was an independent predic￾tor of graft survival. Acute rejection is a stronger negative
factor on graft survival and its role in the development of
graft loss is well established in literature (29). However, in
the two models in the present study, we did not observe
this association. We assume that although acute rejection
was prevalent in both groups, the percentage of steroid￾resistant episodes was small, minimizing its impact on
graft loss.
We observed that ACEI and MMF therapies had a
positive impact on graft loss. The reno-protective effect of
ACEI has been established in a wide variety of progressive
diabetic and non-diabetic renal diseases (27,30,31). In
renal transplantation, there are few clinical studies that
show the beneficial effects of ACEI (32,33). Since MMF
has been introduced in renal transplantation, there are
some reports demonstrating its benefit in CAN (34,35). Ojo
et al. (34) in a study with 66,774 human renal allograft
recipients showed that MMF reduces late allograft loss
independent of its effects on acute rejection.
Our data indicated that Banff 97 and CADI, applied
independently, were insufficient to predict renal graft loss.
This suggests that the two systems indeed analyze differ￾ent parameters and should either be combined in order to
better predict graft outcome, or the best individual param￾eter of each grading system should be combined.
