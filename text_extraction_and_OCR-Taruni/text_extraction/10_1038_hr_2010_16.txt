Recent genetic studies have uncovered a link between familial and idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and germline
mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein type-II receptor (BMPRII). The pathology of PAH is characterized by remodeling of
the pulmonary arteries due to pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell (PASMC) hyperproliferation. Although increased endothelial
injury and impaired suppression of PASMC proliferation are both critical for the cellular pathogenesis of PAH, a detailed molecular
mechanism underlying PAH has yet to be elucidated. In the present study, we investigated the roles of the BMP system and other
vasoactive factors associated with PAH (including endothelin (ET), angiotensin II (Ang II) and aldosterone) in the mitotic actions
of PASMCs isolated from idiopathic and secondary PAH lungs. ET1 and aldosterone stimulated PASMC proliferation of idiopathic
PAH more effectively than secondary PAH, whereas Ang II and ET3 failed to activate mitosis in either of the PASMC cell type.
The effects of ET1 and aldosterone were blocked by bosentan, an ET type-A/B receptor (ETA/BR) antagonist, and eplerenone, a
selective mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) blocker, respectively. Among the BMP ligands examined, BMP-2 and BMP-7, but not
BMP-4 or BMP-6, significantly increased cell mitosis in both PASMC cell types. Notably, ET1- and aldosterone-induced mitosis
and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation were significantly increased in the presence of BMP-2 and BMP-7 in
PASMCs isolated from idiopathic PAH, although additive effects were not observed in PASMCs isolated from secondary PAH.
Inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1)/ERK2 signaling suppressed basal-, ET1- and aldosterone-induced
PASMC mitosis more potently than that of stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase inhibition. Given the fact
that BMP-2 and BMP-7 upregulated ETA/BR and MR expression and that BMP-2 decreased 11bHSD2 (11b-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase type 2) levels in PASMCs isolated from idiopathic PAH, BMPR-Smad signaling may have a key role in amplifying
the ETA/BR and/or MR-ERK signaling in PASMCs of the PAH lung. Collectively, the functional link between BMP and ET and/or the
MR system may be involved in the progress of PASMC mitosis, ultimately leading to the development of clinical PAH.

INTRODUCTION
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a life-threatening disease
that has a prevalence of one to two patients per one million
individuals, with a higher frequency in women.1 This disease is
histologically characterized by excessive proliferation of vascular
endothelium and smooth muscle cells, causing thickening of pulmon￾ary arteriole walls and formation of plexiform lesions that eventually
occlude the vascular lumen.2 The remodeling of pulmonary arterioles
increases vascular resistance and reduces vascular dilatation, resulting
in right ventricular failure.
Approximately six percent of PAH cases have an autosomal-domi￾nant pattern of inheritance. Recent research has uncovered a genetic
predisposition to familial PAH.3,4 Two studies involving the screening
of the locus of the gene for PAH have mapped it to chromosome 2q33
(PPH1) and found mutations in the BMPR2 gene, which encodes
bone morphogenetic protein type-II receptor (BMPRII), in 9 out of

195 or 7 out of 8 families.6 Furthermore, the BMPR2 mutation can be
detected in at least one quarter of sporadic PAH cases.7
Hence, the identification of heterozygous germline mutations in the
BMPR2 gene in familiar and sporadic cases of PAH has proven to be a
crucial breakthrough in elucidating the underlying pathogenesis of
PAH.3 Subsequent functional studies have provided compelling evi￾dence that PAH cells that harbor the BMPR2 mutations exhibit
aberrant BMPRII function and disrupted BMP signaling.8,9 However,
given the fact that almost half of all PAH patients do not have the
BMPR2 mutation, the entire mechanism of pulmonary artery smooth
muscle cell (PASMC) mitogenesis in PAH lungs is still unclear. BMP
ligands that are involved in the aberrant signaling caused by the
BMPRII mutations in PAH patients have also not been identified.
Pulmonary vascular wall thickening due to inappropriate proliferation
of PASMCs is a central cause of elevated pulmonary vascular resistance
and arterial pressure in PAH patients.10,11 Unbalanced proliferation and
apoptosis of smooth muscle cells contributes to vascular remodeling in
pulmonary hypertension.12 Disequilibrium in vasoactive mediators in
the lungs, including increased thromboxane and endothelin-1 (ET1) and
decreased prostacyclin and nitric oxide, leads to vasoconstriction and
proliferation of smooth muscle cells.13,14 Studies using various ET
receptor antagonists have confirmed that ET1 is a critical factor in the
pathogenesis of vascular remodeling in experimental models of chronic
pulmonary hypertension and clinical observation of pulmonary hyper￾tension.15,16 In addition to the role of ET1 as a potent vasoconstrictor, it
also acts directly to modulate the growth of human pulmonary vascular
smooth muscle cells as an autocrine/paracrine mitogen.17,18
Additional factors, such as serotonin, platelet-derived growth factor
(PDGF) and angiotensins, have been postulated to contribute to
pulmonary vasoconstriction, increased smooth muscle growth and
increased matrix deposition. A polymorphism in the angiotensin￾converting enzyme gene is known to be associated with the manifesta￾tion of pulmonary hypertension.19 Increased angiotensin-converting
enzyme expression is observed in plexiform lesions in PAH,20 and
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition seems to delay pulmonary
vascular neointimal formation.21 Therefore, the renin–angiotensin–
aldosterone system (RAAS) represents a group of candidate genes that
could modify disease severity and/or age at diagnosis of individuals
predisposed to develop PAH. Angiotensin II (Ang II) binds primarily
to the Ang II type-1 receptor (AT1R) to promote vascular smooth
muscle constriction. Genetic variants or polymorphisms in genes
within AT1R are known to enhance RAAS activation and/or receptor
function, which may be linked to modifications in the risk of
developing PAH.22 Ang II also acts on the adrenal cortex to promote
aldosterone production by CYP11B2, which encodes P450 aldosterone
synthase. However, the significance of aldosterone action in the
pathogenesis of PAH has yet to be elucidated. There is also accumu￾lating evidence indicating that aldosterone exerts physiologically and/
or pathophysiologically relevant effects on the cardiovascular system,
kidney and brain, in addition to its well-established role in regulating
body electrolytes and water homeostasis.
In the present study, we attempted to elucidate the underlying
mechanism of abnormal PASMC proliferation and the functional link
between the BMP system and other vasoactive factors for PAH,
including ET, Ang II and aldosterone, in the mitotic actions of
PASMCs isolated from primary and secondary PAH lungs.
METHODS
Reagents and supplies
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, penicillin–streptomycin solution, angio￾tensin II acetate salt (Ang II), d-aldosterone, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and
human ET1 and ET3 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO,
USA). Recombinant human BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-6 and BMP-7 and mouse
noggin were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA) and
human PDGF-BB was from PeproTech EC (London, UK). U0126 and
SB203580 were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI, USA) and SP600125
was purchased from Biomol Lab (Plymouth Meeting, PA, USA). Bosentan,
candesartan (CV-11974) and eplerenone were kindly provided by Actelion
Pharmaceuticals (Allschwil, Switzerland), Takeda Chemical Industries (Osaka,
Japan) and Pfizer (New York, NY, USA), respectively.
Isolation of human PASMCs and establishment of primary
PASMC culture
Human PASMCs were isolated during lung transplant surgery from patients
diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and sec￾ondary pulmonary hypertension (SPH). The PAH patient (29-year-old male)
had developed dyspnea, severe hypoxia and right ventricular heart failure
without any family history. The SPH patient (16-year-old female) suffered from
general fatigue, hypoxia and right ventricular heart failure due to a progressive
atrial septal defect. As controls, normal pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells
(Nor-PASMCs) were isolated from the histologically normal pulmonary
arteries of lung tissues resected from a patient (58-year-old male) with lung
cancer. The PAH- and SPH-PASMCs were manually isolated from lung tissues
that had developed severe plexiform lesions in the pulmonary arteries. The
sections of the resected lung tissues were examined by hematoxylin–eosin
staining and the PASMCs were then explanted, isolated and cultured in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and
1% penicillin–streptomycin solution, as previously described.23,24 Until the
scheduled experiments were carried out, the cells were cultured in 75 cm2 flasks
at 371C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air/5% CO2. Cells were used for the
scheduled experiments at passages 5–7. All human subject protocols were
approved by the Ethics Committee of Okayama University Graduate School of
Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, and a written informed
consent was obtained from all patients before the procedure. The investigation
also conforms to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Total cellular RNA extraction and reverse transcriptase-PCR
The PASMCs were grown in six-well plates to B80% confluence, and after the
treatment indicated, the medium was removed and total cellular RNA was
extracted by the isothiocyanate–acid–phenol–chloroform method using TRIzol
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and quantified by measuring absorbance at
260 nm. The RNA was stored at 801C until assays were performed. The
expression of BMP/activin receptors, Smads, follistatin and noggin mRNAs
were detected by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR. Oligonucleotides used for
PCR were custom ordered from Invitrogen. PCR primer pairs for human BMP
receptors, Smads and a house-keeping gene, ribosomal protein-L19, were
selected from different exons of the corresponding genes to discriminate
PCR products that might arise from possible chromosome DNA contaminants,
as reported earlier.25 For AT1R, ET type-A (ETAR) and type-B receptors
(ETBR), mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), noggin, activin receptor-like kinase
(ALK)-1, Id-1 and 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11bHSD2), the
following sequences were used: AT1R, 34–53 and 376–395 from GenBank
accession number M93394; ETAR, 275–295 and 483–503 from L06622; ETBR,
931–951 and 1172–1192 from S44866; MR, 2730–2751 and 2971–2992 from
M16801; noggin, 541–561 and 750–770 from NM_005450; ALK-1, 1160–1180
and 1501–1521 from NM_001077401; Id-1, 211–230 and 350–369 from
X77956; and 11bHSD2, 611–631 and 882–902 from U27317. The extracted
RNA (1 mg) was subjected to a RT reaction using First-Strand cDNA Synthesis
System (Invitrogen) with random hexamers (2 ng ml
1), reverse transcriptase
(200 U) and deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP; 0.5 mM) at 421C for 50 min
and then at 701C for 10 min. Hot-start PCR was then performed using MgCl2
(1.5 mM), dNTP (0.2 mM) and 2.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen)
under the conditions as we have reported previously.25 Aliquots of the PCR
products were electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gels, visualized after ethidium
bromide staining, photographed and scanned.

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis
For the quantification of Id-1, ETAR, ETBR, MR and 11bHSD2 mRNA levels,
real-time PCR was performed using the LightCycler-FastStart DNA master
SYBR Green I system (Roche Diagnostic, Tokyo, Japan) under the optimized
condition of annealing at 601C with 4 mM MgCl2, following the manufacturers
protocol. Accumulated levels of fluorescence for each product were analyzed by
the second derivative method after the melting-curve analysis (Roche Diag￾nostic). Then, following assay validation by calculating the efficiency of each
amplification reaction, the expression levels of target genes were quantified
based on standard curve analysis for each product and normalized to the
ribosomal protein-L19 level in each target.
Genomic DNA extraction and sequence determination of BMPR2
gene
Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral leukocytes of PAH patients using a
genomic DNA isolation kit (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and each
of the 12 exons of the BMPR2 gene were PCR amplified using corresponding
primers that recognize each exon.5 The PCR products were then directly
sequenced (ABI Prism 310, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
Thymidine incorporation assay
The PASMCs (1104 viable cells per well) were precultured in 12-well human
fibronectin-coated plates (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA, USA) containing 1 ml
culture medium. After the preculture period, the medium was replaced with
fresh medium containing 1% fetal calf serum and the indicated concentrations
of hormones and/or growth factors were added. After 24 h of treatment, 0.5 mCi
per well of [methyl-3H] thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ,
USA) was added and incubated for 3 h at 37 1C. The incorporated thymidine
was detected as previously reported.26 Cells were then washed with PBS,
incubated with 10% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid for 30 min at 41C and
solubilized in 0.5 M NaOH, and their radioactivity was determined by a liquid
scintillation counter (TRI-CARB 2300TR, Packard, Meriden, CT, USA).
Western immunoblot analysis
The PASMCs (1104 viable cells per well) were precultured in 12-well plates in
serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium. After 24 h of preculture, the
indicated concentrations of ET and aldosterone were added to the culture
medium either alone or in combination with BMP-2 and BMP-7. After 15 or
60 min stimulation with hormones and/or growth factors, cells were solubilized
in 100 ml RIPA lysis buffer (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY, USA)
containing 1 mM Na3VO4, 1mM NaF, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate and 4% b￾mercaptoethanol. The cell lysates were then subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/immunoblotting analysis using anti-phos￾pho- and anti-total-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 mitogen￾activated protein kinase (MAPK) antibody, anti-phospho- and anti-total-P38
MAPK antibody, anti-phospho- and anti-total-stress-activated protein kinase/
c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) MAPK antibody, anti-phospho- and
anti-total-Akt antibody and anti-phospho-Smad1/5/8 and anti-Smad5 anti￾body (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA). The relative integrated
density of each protein band was digitized by NIH image J 1.34s software.
Statistical analysis
All results are shown as mean±s.e.m. of data from at least three separate
experiments, each performed in triplicate. Differences between groups were
analyzed for statistical significance using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with
Fisher’s protected least significant difference test (StatView 5.0 software, Abacus
Concepts, Berkeley, CA, USA). P-values o0.05 were accepted as statistically
significant.
RESULTS
We first characterized the expression profile of key receptors, including
Ang II, aldosterone and ET, and the BMP system molecules, including
BMP type-I (ALK-2, ALK-3, ALK-4 and ALK-6) and type-II (ActRII,
ActRIIB and BMPRII) receptors, binding proteins including follistatin
and noggin, a TGF-b type-I receptor (ALK-1), Smads1–8 in PASMCs
isolated from normal controls (Nor-PASMCs), idiopathic pulmonary
arterial hypertension (PAH-PASMCs) and secondary pulmo￾nary arterial hypertension (SPH-PASMCs) (Figure 1). As shown in
Figure 1a, AT1R, MR, ETAR and ETBR were expressed in PAH-, SPH￾and Nor-PASMCs as seen by RT-PCR. All of the type-I receptors
examined were expressed in PAH-, SPH- and Nor-PASMCs. BMPRII
and ActRII were expressed in PAH-, SPH- and Nor-PASMCs, although
ActRIIB was not detected in Nor-PASMCs. Follistatin and noggin were
also detected in the three types of PASMCs, with noggin expression in
PAH-PASMCs being comparably lower than that of SPH- and Nor￾PASMCs. PAH- and SPH-PASMCs expressed receptor-specific
Smads1, 2, 3, 5 and 8, a common Smad4 and inhibitory Smads6
and 7, whereas Nor-PASMCs lacked Smad8 expression. Direct sequen￾cing of PCR products from all 12 exons of the BMPR2 gene5 found no
BMPR2 mutations in the genomic DNA of the patient from whom we
collected the PAH-PASMCs. BMPRII mRNA, including the N-termi￾nus region, which encodes the extracellular and transmembrane
domains, was expressed in all three types of PASMCs. To compare
the BMPR signal activities in PAH- and SPH-PAMSCs, the transcrip￾tion of a BMP target gene (Id-1) was examined in PASMCs treated
with BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-6 and BMP-7 for 24 h. As shown in
Figure 1b, BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-6 and BMP-7 all increased Id-1
mRNA levels in PAH- and SPH-PASMCs by the same amount.
We next examined the effects of ET on mitosis of PASMCs isolated
from idiopathic and secondary PAH patients. The mitotic activity of
PASMCs was quantified by a thymidine incorporation assay. As shown
in Figure 1c, ET1 induced cell proliferation of PAH- and SPH￾PASMCs in a concentration-dependent manner for 24 h, in which
the maximal effects of ET1 on PAH-PASMCs were higher compared
with the effects on SPH-PASMCs. In contrast to ET1, ET3 treatment
failed to induce significant mitotic activity in both PAH- and SPH￾PASMCs. Bosentan, a competitive ET1 antagonist that inhibits bind￾ing to both ETAR and ETBR, reduced basal mitotic activity in both
PASMC types. Bosentan (3–30 mM) treatment reversed ET1-induced
cell proliferation, and 30 mM bosentan abolished the effect of ET1 on
mitosis of both PASMC types.
Next, to investigate the contribution of RAAS to PASMC mitosis,
cells were treated with Ang II for 24 h (Figure 2). As shown in Figure
2a and b, Ang II (30–300 nM) had no significant effects on the mitosis
of either PASMC type. In addition, candesartan, an AT1R antagonist,
at a concentration of 1–10 nM, failed to reverse ET1-induced cell
proliferation in these PASMCs. Notably, aldosterone (1–300 nM)
elicited potent mitotic activity in PAH-PASMCs in a concentration￾dependent manner (Figure 2c). The effects of aldosterone on PASMC
mitosis were prominent in PAH-PASMCs compared with SPH￾PASMCs (Figure 2d). An MR antagonist, eplerenone (100–300 nM),
abolished aldosterone-induced mitotic activity, although eplerenone
alone had no significant suppression of basal cell proliferation in both
types of PASMCs (Figures 2c and d).
Because the BMP system, including type-I and -II receptors and
Smads, was found to be present in both PASMC types, we next
examined whether this receptor system is functional. To evaluate the
effect of each BMP ligand, cells were cultured in the presence of four
BMP ligands (Figure 3). As we have previously shown, the effects of
each individual BMP ligands on PASMC mitosis differed, with BMP-2
and BMP-7 acting as stimulators of mitosis of PAH-PASMCs.26
As shown in Figures 3a and c, BMP-2 and BMP-7 (10–100 ng ml1)
induced mitosis in both PAH- and SPH-PASMCs. In contrast, BMP-4
and BMP-6 had no effect on PASMC mitogenicity. PDGF-BB
(100 ng ml1), which is known to be a potent PASMC growth factor,8

approximately twofold (Figure 3). We further examined the functional
interrelationship between the BMP system and ET1 or aldosterone in
PASMC proliferation. As shown in Figures 3b and d, cells were treated
with BMP-2 and BMP-7 (10–100 ng ml1) in combination with either
ET1 (10–100 nM) or aldosterone (10–100 nM). In PAH-PASMCs, ET1
and aldosterone additively enhanced BMP-2- and BMP-7-induced cell
mitosis (Figure 3b). However, in SPH-PASMCs, neither ET1 nor
aldosterone had any significant effect on BMP-2- and BMP-7-induced
cell mitosis (Figure 3d).
To investigate the mechanism by which ET1 and aldosterone
augment BMP actions in PAH-PASMCs, we examined key signaling
pathways, including MAPK and AKT, in PASMCs. Cell mitosis in
most smooth muscle cell types is generally associated with activation
of the MAPK pathway. Recent studies have shown crosstalk between
BMP-Smad signaling and the MAPK pathway in various cell types.27
As shown in Figure 4a, PASMCs were stimulated with aldosterone,
Ang II, ET1, ET3 and PDGF-BB in serum-free conditions for 15 min.
ET1 (100 nM) stimulated ERK1/ERK2 and SAPK/JNK phosphoryla￾tion in PAH-PASMCs, whereas the ET1 effects on ERK1/ERK2 signal
were less potent in SPH-PASMCs (Figure 4a). ET3 also activated
ERK1/ERK2 and SAPK/JNK phosphorylation in both PASMC types;
however, the effects of ET3 were much less potent than that of ET1.
On the contrary, ET1 did not affect P38-MAPK and AKT signaling in
either PASMC type. In addition, the effects of aldosterone and Ang II
(100 nM) alone were negligible with regard to MAPK and AKT
activation in both PAH- and SPH-PASMCs (Figure 4a).
To investigate the involvement of MAPK signaling in PASMCs, we
used specific inhibitors of ERK1/ERK2 and SAPK/JNK pathways,
U0126 and SP600125, respectively. As shown in Figure 4b, treatment
with U0126 (0.3–3 mM) suppressed basal mitotic activity of both
PASMC types, whereas the effects of SP600125 (0.3–3 mM) were less
potent. The effects of these MAPK inhibitors on PASMC mitosis were
further evaluated in the presence of ET1 and aldosterone. The mitotic
action induced by either ET1 or aldosterone was restored by MAPK
inhibition, with the effects of U0126 significantly more effective than
those of SP600125 (Figure 4b). Thus, the mitotic effects induced by
ET1 and aldosterone seemed to occur, at least in part, through
activation of the MAPK pathway in both PAH- and SPH-PASMCs.

To further estimate the signal crosstalk between BMP and MAPK in
PASMCs, cells were cotreated with BMP-2 or BMP-7 in combination
with ET1 and aldosterone. As shown in Figure 5, BMP-2 and BMP-7,
which stimulated cell mitosis in both PASMC types through Smad1/5/
8 phosphorylation, had no effect on MAPK activation (including
ERK1/ERK2 and SAPK/JNK). Notably, ET1-induced phosphorylation
of ERK1/ERK2 and SAPK/JNK was enhanced in the presence of BMP￾2 and BMP-7 in PAH-PASMCs (Figure 5a). BMP-2 and BMP-7 also
upregulated ERK1/ERK2 and SAPK/JNK phosphorylation in the
presence of aldosterone in PAH-PASMCs, although aldosterone
alone did not activate the ERK1/ERK2 and SAPK/JNK pathways
(Figure 5b). In the case of SPH-PASMCs, the combined effects of
ET1 and either BMP-2 or BMP-7 on MAPK activation were only
marginally detected (Figure 5a). No additive effects of aldosterone and
either BMP-2 or BMP-7 on MAPK were observed in SPH-PASMCs
(Figure 5b).
To characterize the differences of ET1 and aldosterone sensitivities
on PASMC mitosis between PAH- and SPH-PASMCs, the expression
levels of ETAR, ETBR, MR and 11bHSD2 were examined by real-time
PCR (Figure 6). As shown in Figure 6a, basal levels of ETAR and ETBR
mRNA were relatively high, but the level of 11bHSD2 mRNA was
lower in PAH-PASMCs compared with SPH-PASMCs. We next
examined the effects of endogenous BMPs on ET receptors and MR
expression in PASMCs using the BMP-binding protein, noggin, which
neutralizes broad BMP actions. Noggin treatment (30 ng ml1) sup￾pressed the expression levels of ETAR and ETBR in PAH-PASMCs for
24 h, whereas it increased ETAR and ETBR expression in SPH￾PASMCs (Figure 6b), suggesting that endogenous BMPs act to
upregulate ET receptors in PAH-PASMCs and downregulate those of
SPH-PASMCs. MR expression was not affected by noggin in either
PASMC type. Furthermore, BMP-2 and BMP-7 upregulated ETAR
and ETBR mRNA expression, whereas ET1 had no effect on ET

receptor expression in PAH-PASMCs (Figure 6c). MR expression was
also upregulated by BMP-2 and BMP-7, whereas 11bHSD2 mRNA
level was decreased by BMP-2 in PAH-PASMCs (Figure 6c).
In contrast to PAH-PASMCs, ETBR and MR expression was decreased
by treatment with BMP-2, BMP-7 and ET1, and the expression of
11bHSD2 was reduced by BMP-2 and BMP-7 in SPH-PASMCs
(Figure 6c).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we have shown a novel interaction between BMP
signaling and other mitogenic actions (Figure 7), namely, (1) PAH￾PASMCs had higher mitotic activity through MAPK in response to
ET1 compared with SPH-PASMCs, in which the mitotic activity
induced by ET1 was significantly inhibited by bosentan; (2) PAH￾but not SPH-PASMCs had mitotic sensitivity in response to not only
ET1 but also aldosterone; (3) ET1 and aldosterone elicited additive
effects on PAH-PASMC mitosis and MAPK stimulation, preferentially
in the presence of BMP-2 and BMP-7, in which ERK was functionally
linked to the mitogenesis of PASMCs; and (4) ET receptor expression
was relatively high in PAH-PASMCs, and ET receptors and MR were
upregulated by BMP-2 and BMP-7.
It is well known that increased production of mitogenic agonists,
such as ET1 and PDGF, in circulation and lung tissues is linked to the
development of pulmonary vascular remodeling.10,11,28 Enhanced
local production of ET1 by pulmonary vascular endothelial cells
correlates with the severity of pulmonary vascular remodeling, sug￾gesting a causal role for ET1 in the development of PAH.28,29 ET1 is a
potent pulmonary vasoconstrictor as well as a PASMC mitogen,17,18,30
and ET1 also has antiapoptotic effects on vascular cells, including
endothelial cells, fibroblasts and systemic smooth muscle cells.31,32 The
mechanism of ET1 action on PASMC involves binding to ET receptors
with subsequent phospholipase C activation, which causes hydrolysis

of phosphatidylinositol and generation of cytosolic inositol trispho￾sphate, leading to an increase of Ca2+ influx and the induction of cell
contraction and membrane-bound diacylglycerol production. Diacyl￾glycerol then activates PKC and triggers intracellular mechanisms that
promote cell proliferation and migration through MAPK.33 Thus, ET
receptor signaling is indirectly, but functionally, linked to the MAPK
cascade.
Bone morphogenetic protein ligands transduce their signals
through two types of serine/threonine kinase receptors, type-I and -
II receptors, both of which are required for signal transduction.34,35
On binding of BMPs, type-II receptors phosphorylate the correspond￾ing type-I receptors, which in turn phosphorylate the intracellular
signal-transducing molecules Smad1/5/8. Among the BMP ligands
examined, we show that BMP-2 and BMP-7 are stimulatory factors for
PAH-PASMC mitosis. The ALK-6/BMPRII receptor pair is recognized
to be the common functional complex for BMP-2 and BMP-7.35,36
Earlier, we showed the roles of BMP ligands and type-I receptors in
PASMC physiology, both of which must interact with BMPRII for the
propagation of BMPRII signaling, as BMP effects including its signal￾ing and mitogenicity were abolished by the inhibition of ALK-6 with
dominant-negative and siRNA techniques.26 Thus, the underlying
mechanism by which BMP regulates cell mitosis also includes the
interaction between BMP ligands and type-I receptors in PAH￾PASMCs.
Identification of increased ET1 levels has led to the development of
ET receptor antagonists, which have improved the course of the
disease for many PAH patients.37,38 Star et al. showed an interesting
finding that BMP-2 and BMP-7, but not BMP-4, increased ET1
production by human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells,
with increased phosphorylation of Smad1/5 levels.39 In our present
data, basal expression of ETAR and ETBR in PASMCs was relatively
high in PAH lungs compared with SPH, in which expression of both
ET receptor types was decreased by treatment with the BMP-binding
protein noggin, whereas it was increased by BMP-2 and BMP-7 in
PAH-PASMCs. Thus, the BMP and ET systems synergistically facilitate
PASMC proliferation in PAH lungs through the enhancement of ET1-
induced MAPK activation with upregulation of ET receptors.
As for the roles of RAAS in the pathogenesis of PAH, we showed
that aldosterone is also functionally involved in PASMC mitosis.
Generally, in epithelial cells, MR is protected from excessive cortisol
by coexpression of 11bHSD2, which converts active cortisol to inactive
cortisone in vivo.
40,41 In contrast, in nonepithelial tissues that do not
express 11bHSD2, MR is generally understood to be overwhelmingly
occupied by existing cortisol rather than aldosterone in vivo.

Figure 4 Effects of aldosterone, angiotensin II and endothelin on MAPK pathway in PASMCs. (a) PASMCs were precultured in serum-free DMEM for 24h
and stimulated with the indicated concentrations of aldosterone (Aldo), angiotensin II (Ang II), endothelin-1 and endothelin-3 (ET1 and ET3) and PDGF-BB.
After a 15min culture, cells were lysed and subjected to SDS-PAGE/immunoblot analysis using anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (pERK1/2), anti-total-ERK1/2 (tERK1/
2), anti-phospho-SAPK/JNK (pJNK), anti-total-SAPK/JNK (tJNK), anti-phospho-P38 (pP38), anti-total-P38 (tP38), anti-phospho-AKT (pAKT) and anti-total￾AKT (tAKT) antibodies. The results shown are representative of those obtained from three independent experiments. The relative integrated density of each
protein band was digitized by NIH image J 1.34s software (lower panel). (b) PAH- and SPH-PASMCs were cultured in DMEM containing 1% FCS and treated
with indicated concentrations of U0126 (0.3–3mM) and SP600125 (0.3–3mM) in the absence or presence of endothelin-1 (ET1; 100nM) or aldosterone
(Aldo; 100 nM) for 24 h followed by a 3 h pulse exposure of 0.5mCi per well of thymidine. The amount of thymidine incorporated into cells was counted.

Endothelin, aldosterone and BMP in PAH pathogenesis
R Yamanaka et al
441

In aldosterone target cells, 11bHSD2 has crucial roles in conferring
aldosterone sensitivity on MR by inactivating intracellular glucocorti￾coids before they occupy MR. In the present study, basal expression of
11bHSD2 in PASMCs was relatively low in PAH lungs compared with
SPH. The inhibitory effects of BMP-2 on 11bHSD2 expression and the
MR upregulation by BMP-2 and BMP-7 may further enhance MR
actions on PAH-PASMC mitosis in response to endogenous miner￾alocorticoids and glucocorticoids in vivo. In addition to the genomic
actions of aldosterone mediated through regulation of nuclear gene
transcription and protein synthesis, aldosterone also elicits rapid and
potentially nongenomic responses, including intracellular calcium,
PKC, MAPK, Rho-kinase and PI3K, in a variety of cells.42 The
interaction between MR and its nongenomic responses is still con￾troversial. Nevertheless, our data showed that eplerenone possibly
inactivates aldosterone-induced PASMC mitosis in PAH lungs, sug￾gesting the possibility of clinical application of MR antagonists for
controlling PAH pathogenesis.
Unbalanced Smad signaling induced by BMP and TGF-b is func￾tionally involved in the pathogenesis of PAH. Among the BMPRII
mutants reported in PAH patients, Nishihara et al.43 showed that
missense mutations within the extracellular and kinase domains of
BMPRII abrogate signal transduction, which seems to be caused in
part by the altered localization of these receptor domains. In contrast,
BMPRII mutants with truncated cytoplasmic tails retained the ability
to transduce normal BMP signaling, suggesting that BMPRII cannot
be a single factor for PAH pathogenesis.43 These findings have raised
the possibility of the involvement of additional genetic and/or somatic
factors to trigger the development of PAH lesions and further imply
that causal factors for PAH development are heterogenous.
Our present study revealed that mitotic effects of ET1, aldosterone
and PDGF are, at least in part, MAPK (ERK1/2 and SAPK/JNK)-
dependent. There is increasing evidence that other signaling pathways
may also be involved in mediating BMP actions. Examples include
TGF-b-activated kinase-1, a member of the MAPK kinase kinase
family,44 which is activated by BMP-4 or TGF-b,
44,45 and the Ras/
Rac families of small GTP-binding proteins, which are also implicated
in TGF-b signaling. Moreover, the ERK1/ERK2 and SAPK/JNK path￾ways are linked to TGF-b/BMP signal transduction in some cell
types.46–48 The data provided here show that the MAPK pathway is
functionally involved in PAH-PASMC mitosis, which is facilitated
under the presence of combined stimuli of either ET1 or aldosterone
and the BMP system.

Figure 5 Effects of BMP on endothelin- and aldosterone-induced MAPK activation in PASMCs. PASMCs were precultured in serum-free DMEM for 24 h and
stimulated with BMP-2 (100 ng ml1) and BMP-7 (100 ngml1) in the absence or presence of (a) endothelin-1 (ET1; 100 nM) and (b) aldosterone (Aldo;
100 nM). After a 60min culture, cells were lysed and subjected to SDS-PAGE/immunoblot analysis using anti-pERK1/2, tERK1/2, pJNK, tJNK, pSmad1/5/8
and Smad5 antibodies. The results shown are representative of those obtained from three independent experiments. The relative integrated density of each
protein band was digitized by NIH image J 1.34s software (lower panel). Results are shown as mean±s.e.m. of data from at least three separate
experiments, each performed in triplicate; *Po0.05 and **Po0.01 vs. control groups; #Po0.05 vs. ET1- or Aldo-treated groups.

Collectively, the present data suggest that the BMP system may
upregulate mitogenic sensitivity to exogenous ET1 and aldosterone in
PAH-PASMCs. This could be a feature distinct from SPH-PASMCs,
which still have an autoregulatory system in response to exogenous
ET1 and/or aldosterone. The relatively low penetrance of PAH within
families supports a ‘two-hit’ hypothesis in which the vascular abnorm￾PAH-PASMC PAH-PASMC SPH-PASMC

Figure 6 Effects of BMP on the expression of endothelin and mineralocorticoid receptors in PASMCs. (a) Total cellular RNA was extracted from PAH- and
SPH-PASMCs, and the basal expression levels of ETAR, ETBR, MR and 11bHSD2 mRNA levels were examined by quantitative real-time PCR. (b, c) PASMCs
were treated with noggin (30ngml1), BMP-2 and BMP-7 (100 ngml1) in combination with endothelin-1 (ET1; 100nM) for 24 h. The expression levels of
target genes were normalized to the RPL19 level in each sample. Results show the mean±s.e.m. of data from three separate experiments, each performed
in triplicate; *Po0.05 vs. control groups and between the indicted groups.

Figure 7 Possible interaction between endothelin, aldosterone and BMP receptor signaling in PASMC proliferation. PAH-PASMCs had higher mitotic activity
and capacity of MAPK phosphorylation in response to endothelin-1 (ET1) compared with SPH-PASMCs. The mitotic activity induced by ET1 and aldosterone
(Aldo) is inhibited by bosentan (Bos) and eplerenone (Ep), respectively. PAH-PASMCs, but not SPH-PASMCs, also had mitotic sensitivity in response to Aldo.
ET1 and Aldo elicit additive effects on PAH-PASMC mitosis and MAPK activation, preferentially in the presence of BMP-2 and BMP-7. The expression of ET
type-A/B receptors (ETA/BR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) in PAH-PASMCs was also upregulated in the presence of BMP-2 and BMP-7.
Endothelin, aldosterone and BMP in PAH pathogenesis
R Yamanaka et al
443
Hypertension Research

alities characteristic of idiopathic PAH are triggered by accumulation
of genetic and/or environmental factors, including upregulation of
vasoconstrictive hormones. The combination of increased endothelial
injury associated with ET1 production and impaired suppression of
PASMC proliferation, partly controlled by BMPs, could be critical for
the cellular pathogenesis of PAH. However, there is still a case
limitation in our present study, and the accumulation of basic
experimental data derived from human samples would be absolutely
necessary to elucidate the cellular mechanism leading to the develop￾ment of idiopathic PAH and the characterization of the molecular
basis of differential mechanisms of idiopathic and secondary PAH.
The present findings may also permit further understanding of the
molecular pathogenesis of PAH and novel therapeutic prospects to
control ET1- and aldosterone-induced activation of MAPK for the
prevention of excessive mitosis of PASMCs.
