Abstract
Background: Liver transplant recipients suffer many complications, but few intraoperative interventions supported
by high-quality evidence have been found effective to reduce their incidence or severity. Fluid balance has been
proposed as an important aspect of perioperative care in high-risk recipients. We will conduct a systematic review
aimed at evaluating the effects of restrictive perioperative fluid management strategies compared to liberal ones on
clinically significant postoperative outcomes.
Methods: We will search through major databases (CINAHL Complete, EMB Reviews, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PubMed,
and the gray literature (CADTH, Clinical Trials, National Guideline Clearing House, NICE, MedNar, Google Scholar and
Open Grey)), from inception up to a date close to the review submission for publication, for eligible studies.
Randomized controlled trials and comparative non-randomized studies (prospective or retrospective) comparing two
fluid management strategies (or two outcomes with available data on fluid volume received for observational studies)
on adult liver recipients will be included. Eligible studies will have to report at least one postoperative complication or
mortality. Our primary outcome will be acute renal failure and our secondary exploratory outcomes will be all other
postoperative complications and mortality. Study selection and data abstraction using an electronic standardized form
will be performed by three authors. Risk of bias will be evaluated and data will be pooled if limited clinical diversity is
observed.
Discussion: Human organs available for transplantation are scarce resources. Strategies to improve recipients’ survival
are needed. We hypothesize that restrictive fluid management strategies will be associated with better postoperative
outcomes than liberal fluid management strategies. This systematic review will improve our understanding of
the available evidence and help us better inform future clinical trials.
Systematic review registration: This systematic review protocol is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42017054970).

Background
Liver transplantation is the last line of therapy for severe
end-stage liver disease and is increasingly performed
throughout the world [1, 2]. In the past decade, overall
waiting list and post-transplant survival rates have in￾creased alongside postoperative complications, a signifi￾cant burden for patient care [3, 4]. Due to the scarcity of
human organs, strategies to improve recipients’ out￾comes and organ survival are needed [2, 4].
Liver transplant recipients suffer, on average, more
than three postoperative complications, with over half of
them being severe [5, 6]. Several perioperative events
and factors seem associated with the risk of complica￾tions [5, 7–17]. Among these, perioperative fluid
management has been associated with postoperative
complications and proposed as an important aspect of
care in high-risk recipients [16, 18, 19]. A recent US sur￾vey revealed that more than 60% of anesthesiologists use
either phlebotomy or normovolemic hemodilution to re￾duce blood transfusions and improve post-transplant
outcomes, even though few of these interventions are
supported by high-quality evidence [20, 21]. The impact
of perioperative fluid balance on postoperative complica￾tions is better understood in other surgical populations,
with hundreds of different combinations of fluid man￾agement protocols and hemodynamic goals studied over
the past decade [22]. Perioperative fluid imbalance, de￾fined as too little or too much fluid, was recently associ￾ated with a greater than 60% increase in postoperative
complications after major abdominal surgery [23]. Re￾cent systematic reviews suggest that cardiac output￾guided fluid administration, compared to either fixed re￾strictive or fixed liberal strategies, reduces postoperative
complications by 20–30% in patients undergoing major
surgery [24, 25, 26], thus underscoring the significant
role of fluid management in this population. More im￾portantly, a recent multicenter clinical trial showed an
increased incidence of acute renal failure when a fixed
restrictive perioperative fluid strategy was compared to a
liberal one during major abdominal surgery [27]. Liver
transplantations were not included in any of these
studies.
Since evidence suggests that specific perioperative
fluid management strategies can improve or worsen
postoperative outcomes in many surgical populations,
that such strategies are being used in the liver transplant
population without high-quality data, and that physi￾cians are eager to use perioperative fluid and blood vol￾ume management strategies to improve outcomes in this
population, the role of perioperative fluid management
strategies in liver transplantation needs to be better
understood [5, 7–16, 20, 21, 23–25, 26]. Therefore, we
will conduct a systematic review aimed at evaluating the
effects of a restrictive perioperative fluid management
strategy compared to a liberal strategy on clinically sig￾nificant outcomes in adult patients undergoing liver
transplantation.
Methods
Study design
This systematic review will be conducted according to
the standard methodology developed by the Cochrane
Collaboration [28], and the results will be reported ac￾cording to the PRISMA statement [29]. This protocol
was designed according to the PRISMA-P statement (see
Additional file 1 for associated checklist) [30].
Research question
“What are the effects of a perioperative restrictive fluid
management strategy, compared to a liberal one, on
acute renal failure in adult patients undergoing liver
transplantation?” We hypothesize that the use of re￾strictive fluid management strategies will be associated
with a lower incidence of acute renal failure.
Search strategy and information sources
We will search the bibliographic electronic databases
CINAHL Complete (from 1937 onwards), EMB Reviews
(from 1991 onwards), EMBASE (from 1974 onwards),
MEDLINE (from 1946 onwards), PubMed (from incep￾tion), and the gray literature (CADTH, Clinical Trials,
National Guideline Clearing House, NICE, MedNar,
Google Scholar, and Open Grey, from inception) up to a
date close to the review submission for publication. The
search will incorporate words and expressions for two
conceptual groups: liver transplantation and fluid therapy.
For each database, we will use words and expressions
from controlled vocabulary (MESH, EMTREE, and others)
and free text searching. The search strategy, prepared by
an information specialist, is detailed in Additional file 2.
Snowballing method will also be used to identify other
studies within the references of selected studies. Hand
searching for relevant abstracts published in the annual
meeting supplements of the following organizations will
be performed for the years available on their website:
American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases
(AASLD), European Association for the Study of Liver
(EASL), International Liver Transplantation Society
(ILTS), American Society of Transplantation (AST), and
European Society of Organ Transplantation (ESOT).
Study eligibility
Studies will be eligible if they meet the following criteria
and report any outcome of interest to our study.
Types of studies
Randomized controlled trials, quasi-randomized trials,
and comparative non-randomized studies (prospective or
Carrier et al. Systematic Reviews (2018) 7:180 Page 2 of 6

retrospective) will be included. Randomized controlled tri￾als will be considered if at least two different fluid man￾agement strategies are compared, one being more
restrictive than the other, regardless of the methods used.
Observational studies will be included if at least two
groups with different fluid management strategies, or dif￾ferent amounts of fluid administered, are compared. Ob￾servational studies with outcome-based reported groups
will also be included if the volume of fluid received can be
extracted for each group. Editorials, letters, narrative type
reviews, case reports, and animal studies will be excluded.
Participants
We will include studies if more than 80% of participants
are adults (≥ 18 years old or as defined in individual stud￾ies) undergoing liver transplantation alone (deceased or
living donor graft). We will exclude studies in which more
than 20% of the participants received a combined trans￾plantation (liver + kidney, liver + lung or liver + heart).
Intervention
The intervention group will be composed of patients re￾ceiving a restrictive perioperative fluid management
strategy (applied in the intraoperative period, the post￾operative period, or both). Any strategy or type of fluid
management protocol that limits the amount of fluid ad￾ministered by the clinician will be considered a restrict￾ive fluid strategy (early goal-directed protocols, weight￾based protocols, low-CVP protocols, phlebotomies,
pre-determined volume management protocols, retro￾spectively classified received fluid strategy, etc.). In ob￾servational studies reporting groups with different
volumes of fluid received, the group with the lowest vol￾ume will be considered the intervention group.
Comparator
The control group will be composed of patients receiv￾ing a more liberal perioperative fluid management
strategy than the intervention group. Any type of fluid
management protocol will be considered.
Outcome measures
Our main efficacy outcome is the incidence of acute
renal failure (any definition and any time point before 30
postoperative days).
Our additional exploratory outcomes are as follows:
 Mortality (hospital and latest reported mortality).
 Perioperative complications including (but not
restricted to): graft failure (any definition); biliary
complications (leak, strictures, and/or ischemic
cholangiopathy (any definition)); pulmonary
complications (pneumonia, pulmonary edema,
acute respiratory distress syndrome, duration of
mechanical ventilation, ventilation-free days at
latest); cardiovascular complications (myocardial
infarction, arrhythmias, shock, thromboembolic
events); infectious complications (wound infection,
abdominal abscess, bacteremia, catheter-related
bloodstream infection, urinary tract infection).
 Perioperative bleeding; postoperative red blood cell
transfusions; postoperative procoagulant blood
products;
 Intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay and ICU
readmission; hospital length of stay.
Acute renal failure has been chosen as a primary out￾come because of its high incidence following liver trans￾plantation (13–71%), its association with intraoperative
events, the burden on postoperative care and mortality,
and because it is a patient-centered outcome [5, 6, 10,
11, 31, 32]. The worldwide low postoperative mortality
in this population (10% at 1 year) is highly likely to pre￾clude the observation of a treatment effect from differ￾ent perioperative interventions [1, 33]. Mortality is,
however, among our additional exploratory outcomes.
Year of publication and language
Eligibility will not be restricted by year nor by language
of publication.
Data management
Study selection
We will use the Endnote X8.2 software to merge re￾trieved titles, remove duplicates, and screen titles and
abstracts. Three investigators will review every poten￾tially eligible citation to identify all relevant studies (one
investigator (FMC) will review all of them, and two
others (PA, MC) will each review half of them). Two
investigators (FMC, MC) will do a full-text review of
selected citations to confirm study eligibility before
extracting data. Disagreement will be resolved by con￾sensus (FMC, MC, PA).
Data abstraction
Two investigators (FMC and HTW) will independently
review every eligible study retrieved from the search and
extract data with a standardized electronic data extrac￾tion form (see Additional file 3). Studies in languages
other than English or French will be translated before
abstraction. Data will be kept in a secured database. Dis￾agreement will be resolved by consensus. Authors of re￾trieved articles will be contacted for additional
information if deemed necessary, such as a potential
available but not reported outcome.
Carrier et al. Systematic Reviews (2018) 7:180 Page 3 of 6

Data items
We will retrieve data on study characteristics, population
characteristics, type of donor, perioperative period when
the intervention is applied (and the associated volume of
fluid received), type of intervention, type of fluid re￾ceived, bleeding, transfusion of blood products, and
every reported review outcome. Co-interventions such
as the type of vasopressors used, the use of a coagulation
management protocol, and transfusion thresholds will be
also extracted.
Risk of bias (ROB) assessment
ROB assessment will be performed at the study level in
all important domains for both the study’s primary out￾come and review’s primary outcome (acute renal failure).
The effect of starting and adhering to the intervention
will be assessed. Two investigators (FMC and HTW) will
independently assess ROB. Disagreement will be re￾solved by consensus. ROB assessment for both out￾comes, if available, will be reported for each individual
study using a risk of bias summary figure and detailed
information for each evaluated domain as a supplemen￾tary appendix.
The Cochrane ROB assessment tool 2.0 for randomized
trials will be used for RCTs [34]. For observational studies,
the ROBINS-I tool for non-randomized studies of inter￾ventions will be used and the following confounding do￾mains that might influence selection of exposure (fluid
management received) and the measure of effect (compli￾cations) will be included in our ROB assessment: comor￾bidities, baseline severity of the underlying liver disease,
and baseline severity of non-liver organ failure [35]. Appli￾cation of important co-interventions in both groups will
also be included in the ROB assessment of observational
studies, especially the use procoagulant blood products as
prophylaxis and the use of a coagulation management
protocol. Publication bias will be explored with a funnel
plot using a common significant outcome.
Data synthesis
Main analyses
We will summarily describe retrieved observational
studies and randomized controlled trials separately. We
will also report studies separately based on the timing of
the intervention (intraoperative, postoperative, or both).
We will detail study populations, fluid management pro￾tocols used, the type and amount of fluid, and blood
products received and outcomes (with definition and
time point used). In circumstances where pooling of
studies is deemed inappropriate, we will only provide a
qualitative discussion of the findings. If data pooling is
appropriate based on low clinical diversity across studies
(similar population and interventions), we will pool out￾comes using Review Manager 5.3 (The Cochrane
Collaboration, 2014). The measure of effect of dichot￾omous data will be risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence
intervals and mean differences (MD) with 95% confi￾dence intervals for continuous data. We will use random
effects models according to the DerSimonian-Laird
method to take into account the underlying variation
across studies. We will use the I
2 measure of consistency
across trials to evaluate heterogeneity and will report
both this score and the Cochrane’s Q test [36].
Subgroup analyses
We will perform a series of subgroup analyses based on
study characteristics to further explore our findings and
explain potential sources of heterogeneity. We will in￾vestigate (1) the risk of bias (low vs. high risk of bias),
(2) the difference in type of fluid management protocols
(goal-directed therapy vs. other protocols), (3) the differ￾ence in the type of fluid received (synthetic colloid vs.
not), (4) the difference in the use of a coagulation
management protocol as a co-intervention (use vs.
non-use), and (5) the type of graft used (living vs. ca￾daveric donor).
Summary of findings
We will summarize our findings in a table generated by
the GRADEpro web-based tool that will include the
quality of cumulative evidence using GRADE criteria
[37, 38]. All reported outcomes will be included.
Discussion
Perioperative complications in liver transplant recipients
are frequent, especially acute renal failure (13–71%), and
are associated with postoperative mortality [5, 6, 10, 11].
Since human organs available for transplantation are a
scarce resource, investigation of new perioperative strat￾egies to improve recipients’ outcomes is required. There
is a paucity of high-quality evidence reporting the im￾pact of different intraoperative interventions to achieve
these goals in the liver transplant population, and fluid
management is an important part of perioperative care.
We expect to find a limited number of clinical trials
and a moderate amount of observational studies with a
moderate to serious risk of bias. The strength of this sys￾tematic review will be the broad evaluation of available
evidence on perioperative fluid management strategies
by including all studies reporting at least one clinically
significant postoperative outcome. Our review will be
limited by the potentially low methodological quality of
the included studies, the possible clinical diversity be￾tween them, the probable insufficient power and infor￾mation size to draw any definitive conclusions, and its
exploratory nature. If outcome data allow performance
of multiple meta-analyses, the use of multiple statistical
testing might also limit the interpretation of findings.

Our systematic review will, however, improve our under￾standing of the available evidence and inform future re￾search in the field.
