Abstract
Systemic mycosis is among the most feared opportunistic infections
in the immunocompromised host. Difficulty and delay in diagnosis
and treatment often result in poor outcomes. In this communication
a metastatically spreading form of subcutaneous aspergillosis
developed in a patient with a history of allogeneic stem cell
transplantation for relapsed Hodgkin's lymphoma. Strikingly,
necrotizing cutaneous papules or ulcerating lesions were absent.
Diagnosis was accomplished after excision of a clinically non-


suggestive subcutaneous nodule. Despite prompt initiation of
antimycotic therapy the outcome was fatal; dosage of conventional
and liposomal amphotericin B was limited due to treatment-related
toxicities. This case report describes a novel form of aspergillosis
and underlines the need for an aggressive diagnostic approach in
severely immunocompromised patients. Bone Marrow
Transplantation (2001) 28, 899–901.
