Hepatocytes from these animals were also examined by
electron microscopy and subjected to quantitative mor￾phometric analysis. The results indicated that the two
populations of hepatic ribosomes respond differently to
acute insulin deficiency. There was an overall reduc￾tion (P < 0.001) in total number of bound ribosomes per
volume cytoplasm: the remaining bound ribosomes un￾derwent a shift to smaller-sized ribosomal messenger
RNA (mRNA) aggregates (P < 0.02); and the protein￾synthetic activity of these bound ribosomes was less
than normal (P < 0.02) when protein synthesis was
directed by endogenous mRNA. However, there was no
difference between bound ribosomes from livers of nor￾mal and diabetic rats when protein synthesis was directed
by polyuridylic acid. In contrast, free ribosomes were
unchanged in number and degree of ribosomal mRNA
aggregation, but displayed a significantly increased
rate of in vitro protein synthesis (P < 0.01) as com￾pared to normal controls. This increased protein-syn￾thetic activity occurred when amino acid incorporation
was directed by endogenous mRNA or polyuridylic acid.
These changes in structure and function of bound and
free hepatic ribosomes were prevented by the concomitant

diabetic rats seems to be secondary to marked disruption
and disaggregation of the rough endoplasmic reticulum
(RER) with production of smaller ribosomal mRNA ag￾gregates which incorporate less amino acids into protein.
Increased protein synthetic activity of free ribosome ap￾pears to be related to the ability of these ribosomes to
copy mRNA more efficiently.
INTRODUCTION
Recent studies from our laboratory have indicated that
the decrease in hepatic ribosomal protein synthesis that
accompanies acute experimental diabetes mellitus (1, 2)
is associated with marked ultrastructural changes in the
membrane-bound population of hepatic ribosomes (2).
This led us to postulate that the observed reduction in
total hepatic protein synthesis was the result of an ef￾fect of insulin lack on the structure and function of the
membrane-bound polyribosomes (2). In the current
experiments we have attempted to provide further sup￾port for this hypothesis by separating bound and free
hepatic ribosomes (3, 4) and independently evaluating
the ability of the two ribosomal fractions to synthesize
protein in vitro. The clarification of this issue seemed im￾portant in view of the fact that hepatic membrane￾bound ribosomes have been shown to synthesize proteins
which differ qualitatively from those synthesized by
ribosomes free in the cytosol (5-8), and this difference
may have special relevance in the diabetic state. The re￾sults to be reported indicate that bound polyribosomes
from diabetic rat liver were less active than bound poly￾ribosomes from normal rat livers in carrying out pro￾tein synthesis. In contrast, the protein-synthetic ac￾tivity of free ribosomes from livers of acutely diabetic

rats appeared to be greater than that of normal controls.
These conclusions were also supported by findings from
electron microscopy. Thus, acute and severe experimental
diabetes exerts a widely divergent effect on the protein
synthetic behavior of the two hepatic ribosomal popula￾tions.
METHODS
Experimental protocol. Female Sprague-Dawley rats
weighing 180-200 g were used for all studies. Diabetes
mellitus was produced by intravenous injection of alloxan
monohydrate (75 mg/kg body wt) in saline or streptozo￾tocin' (100 mg/kg) in pH 4.5 citrate buffer after an 18 h
overnight fast. Paired control rats were given equal vol￾umes of isotonic saline. 48 h after alloxan administration,
and 72 h after streptozotocin administration, the rats were
killed by decapitation and the livers rapidly removed.
Streptozotocin-treated rats required 72 h to reach the
degree of hyperglycemia achieved in 48 h in alloxan-treated
rats. Because previous studies had indicated that diabetic
animals ate little food on the last day of the experiment,
all rats were fasted for 18 h before death. Before this 18-h
period rats ate 10-18 g of rat chow/day, and no significant
difference was observed in food consumption between
normal and diabetic animals. Only animals with blood glu￾cose a levels greater than 650 mg/100 ml were used in
diabetic experiments. Blood glucose levels of control rats
were 88-105%. Some streptozotocin-treated rats received
insulin in order to prevent the development of insulin de￾ficiency. Subcutaneous lente insulin injections were begun
18 h after streptozotocin administration when blood glucose
was already greater than 200 mg/100 ml, and 8-10 U of in￾sulin were given per 24 h in divided doses, to keep blood
glucose levels below 200 mg/100 ml. For some experiments,
3H-labeled ribosomes were produced by injecting 100 /kCi
[3H]phenylalanine (6.5 Ci/mm) intraperitoneally 12 h be￾fore sacrifice.
Comparisons between individual data and group means
were carried out by paired and unpaired Student t tests.
Preparation of menmbrane-bound and free ribosomes. Ex￾cised livers were immediately weighed and homogenized
in 2 vol of 7.6 TKM-S0.25 (0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.6,
0.025 M KCl, 0.004 M MgCl2, 0.25 M sucrose 3) with six
strokes of a Teflon pestle (approximately 1,000 rpm) in a
ground glass homogenizer. 500 and 10,000 g supernates
were prepared in parallel by centrifuging aliquots of
homogenate for 10 min at appropriate speeds (Sorvall
SS4; Ivan Sorvall Inc., Newtown, Conn.). The 500 and
10,000 g supernates were then layered over a discontinuous
sucrose gradient for isolation of the ribosome fractions.
Sucrose gradients for the separation of free and mem￾brane-bound ribosomes were made by a modification of the
technique of Blobel and Potter (3, 9). 4 ml of supernate,
either 500 or 10,000 g, was layered over 3 ml 0.5 M sucrose
solution, in turn layered over 3 ml 2.0 M sucrose solution,
both containing ribonuclease inhibitor prepared from rat
liver cytosol (10, 11) diluted 1: 1 with 7.5 TKM (0.05 M

Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.025 M KCl, 0.005 XL MgCl2). Mg`
concentration in the resulting sucrose gradient solutions
was measured as 4.3 mM; the K+ concentration was 36 mM.
The discontinuous gradients were centrifuged 18 h at
105,000 g. After the centrifugation, the top 2 ml (clear
and colorless) was discarded. The turbid layer (about 5
ml) above the 2.0 M sucrose solution was removed. This
layer contained the membrane-bound ribosomes. The 2.0 M
solution and the pellet contained the free ribosomes. The
free and bound fractions were each diluted to 8 ml with
7.6 TKM-S0.25. 10% wt/vol sodium deoxycholate (DOC) '
was added to 1.3% final concentration to the bound frac￾tion. Both fractions were then centrifuged 4 h at 105,000 g.
The supernates were discarded and the pellets were sus￾pended in 7.6 TKM-S0.25 and centrifuged for 3 min at
3,000 g. Aliquots of the clear suspension were placed into
small tubes and stored at - 20'C.
Evaluation of separation technique. Free and bound ribo￾somes 3H-labeled in vivo were harvested by sucrose gradient
centrifugation of postmitochondrial supernate from rats
given [3H] phenylalanine before sacrifice. The turbid layer
above the 2.0 M sucrose layer contained labeled bound
ribosomes. The pellet contained labeled free-ribosomes and
the 2.0 M layer was discarded. The distribution of labeled
bound and free ribosomes was studied by combining ali￾quots of each labeled fraction with post-mitochondrial
supernate from a rat which had not received [3H] phenyl￾alanine and centrifuging over discontinuous sucrose gradi￾ents as described above. After centrifugation, the contents
of the tubes were carefully removed in aliquots of 1 ml
or less. The pellets remaining in the tube were suspended
in 1 ml 7.6 TKM-S0.25. Radioactivity of the aliquots was
measured by liquid scintillation with Aquasol with [3H]-
phenylalanine internal standards.
Recovery of bound and free hepatic ribosomes. Livers
were weighed, homogenized in known volumes of buffer,
centrifuged at either 500 or 10,000 g, and 4 ml of the
resulting supernate used to prepare bound and free ribo￾somes. The total RNA content of the various ribosomal
preparations was determined by the method of Schneider
(12), and recovery of bound and free ribosomal RNA
from livers of normal and diabetic rats was then calculated
and expressed as milligrams of ribosomal RNA per gram
of wet weight liver.
Amino acid incorporation directed by endogenous mRNA.
Protein-synthetic activity of the isolated ribosomes was
estimated by in vitro incorporation of [3H] phenylalanine
into TCA-precipitable radioactivity. The basic details of
the assay system have appeared in earlier publications (2,
13). The conditions of the assay are such that the incorpo￾ration of labeled amino acid into protein is linearly related
to the amount of ribosomal RNA incubated and the amount
of ribosomes is the rate-limiting factor for protein synthe￾sis. Ribosome suspension containing 100-300 jug ribosomal
RNA were added to 1 ml of an incubation solution con￾taining 1.5 mg pH 5 fraction protein (derived from pooled
normal rat liver), 1.9 Amol ATP, 0.37 /Amol GTP, 8.2

alanine (7 Ci/mm, Schwarz/M-ann Div., Becton, Dickinson
& Co., Orangeburg, N. Y.), 0.7 Amol dithiothreitol, and
300 umol sucrose. The solution was buffered with 0.04 M
Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. The Mg++ concentration was adjusted
to 11 mM and the K+ concentration was 55 mM.
Samples were incubated at 370C and duplicate 100-Al ali￾quots were withdrawn at 0, 10, 20, and 30 min and
placed on filter papers (14). Nonprotein radioactivity was
extracted with hot 5% TCA and remaining TCA-pre￾cipitable radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation.
Protein-synthetic activity was expressed as counts per min￾ute of [3H]phenylalanine incorporated per milligram ribo￾somal RNA in the incubated sample. All comparisons be￾tween normal and diabetic ribosomes were made with
samples isolated on the same day in the same assay. Opti￾mal amino acid incorporation for both normal and dia￾betic bound and free ribosomes occurred at 11 mM Mg++
concentration. Relative differences in amino acid incorpo￾ration found at 11 mM Mg++ persisted for Mg++ concen￾trations between 3 and 18 mM.
Amino acid incorporation directed by polvuridylic acid.
Protein synthesis directed by polyuridylic acid was assayed
for all pairs of normal and alloxan-diabetic ribosomes
preparations. 0.05-0.08 mg ribosomal RNA was preincu￾bated at 370C for 60 min in a total volume of 600 IAI with
composition as for endogenous mRNA incubations except
that [3H]phenylalanine was omitted. Polysome profiles of
preincubated samples showed that over 95% of the poly￾somes had been converted to monosomes. After the pre￾incubations, samples were divided into duplicate 3001I ali￾quots. 75 IA of incubation solution (2.85 ,umol/ml ATP,

7.8, Mg++ and K+ concentration 18 and 23 mM, respec￾tively) containing polyuridylic (polyU) acid (1.4 mg/ml)
was added to one aliquot, and 75 ul of incubation solution
without polyU was added to the other.
Duplicate 75-,ul aliquots of the incubating samples were
taken after 0 and 120 min of 370C incubation and placed
on filter papers to be processed and counted by liquid
scintillation as described above. Protein-synthetic activity
was expressed as counts per minute incorporated into TCA￾precipitable radioactivity per milligram RNA for each in￾cubated sample. Net activity was calculated by subtracting
counts per minute for the sample without polyU f rom
counts per minute for the sample with polyU. Background
radioactivity, calculated from a tube with polyU but no
ribosomes, was subtracted from all samples. Incubations
were discarded if the sample without polyU incorporated
more than 5%S as much radioactivity as the sample with
polyL. Under the conditions of this assay, radioactivity
incorporated into protein was linearly related to the amount
of ribosomes incubated up to 0.15 mg RNA. Peak amino
acid incorporation for both normal and diabetic ribosome
samples in this assay system was at 18 mM Mfg++ con￾centration. Relative differences persisted from 8-26 mM
Ma++.
Preparation of polysome profiles. Aliquots of ribosome
suspensions (about 0.3 mg ribosomal RNA) were layered
on a 13-ml 10-40% chilled linear sucrose gradient in 0.05
Ml Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.025 M KC1, and 0.005 M MgCl2.
The gradients were centrifuged 45 min at 40,000 rpm and
4VC in a Spinco SW-40 rotor (Beckman Instruments Inc.,
Spinco Div., Palo Alto, Calif.). The gradients were pumped
through an 80,x1 flow cell 6 at a rate of 0.4 ml/min and
absorbance was continuously recorded at 260 nm with a
Beckman DU spectrophotometer and chart recorder (Beck￾man Instruments Inc., Electronic Instruments Div., Schiller
Park, Ill. (15, 16).
Preparation of electron micrographs. Ultrastructural
morphometric analyses were carried out on the same livers
used for the study in vitro protein synthesis and polysome
profiles. Tissue was taken from the central area of the left
hepatic lobe, fixed 4 h in 1% osmium tetroxide in Millonig's
phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), dehydrated in graded alcohols,
and finally embedded in a mixture of epon and araldite
plastic. Thin sections (300-500 A) were obtained from
areas within six hepatocytes from a given portal triad.
The thin sections were collected on Formvar-coated grids,
stained with uranyl acetate and Reynold's lead citrate, and
inspected with a JEM 100-B electron microscope.
Tissues were examined for general ultrastructural charac￾teristics. In addition, two separate quantitative morpho￾metric analyses were performed. In the first instance, the
area of rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) per cyto￾plasmic volume was estimated by the methods of Loud
(17) and Weibel (18) in which the surface density of RER
(SRER) is quantitatively represented by the contour length
density of RER profiles. This latter is estimated by placing
a grid of test lines (1) on the electron micrographs and
counting the intersections (C) formed by these lines with
the RER profile borders. This relationship is given by the
equation:
SRER = 4C M/1,000 1
where: SRER= area of RER/volume of cytoplasm (u2RER/
3 cytoplasm); C -number of intersections of RER pro￾files (X 2) with sampling lines; I = sum of length of
sampling lines measured in millimeters; M =total magnifi￾cation of photographic print. Very low magnification
(3,000 X) electron micrographs were prepared of four
nucleated cells from each of four rats from each experi￾mental group. A random selection of cells was assured by
the fact that the microscopist could not distinguish the
details of the cells at the magnification chosen and focusing
for photographs was done electronically. The electron
micrograph of each cell was photographically enlarged on
double sheets of 11 X 14 inch paper to a final magnifica￾tion of 16,380 X. The amount of RER present was evaluated
at an additional threefold magnification by a technician
unaware of the origin of the samples.
In the second quantitative method the number of ribo￾somes per area of endoplasmic reticulum membrane was
quantitated (18). Higher magnification electron micro￾graphs (13,300 X) of portions of three cells from each of
four animals for each experimental group were selected
randomly. The micrographs were printed on 11 X 14 inch
paper, bringing the final magnification of the area to 56,-
600 X. In photographs in which small amounts of RER
were present, every strand was evaluated. For larger com￾plexes of RER, the pictures were divided into quadrants
(by a random number system on the reverse side of the
photograph) and all RER strands within the selected quad￾rant were examined. The length of the designated RER
(L) which lay perpendicular to the plane of the section
was traced with a map-measuring device in each photo￾graph. The sum of the lengths of closely opposed RER

profiles was doubled (to account for both sides of the
organelle), while the circumference of circular or irregular
RER profiles was directly traced and recorded without
doubling. It must be assumed that ribosomes are attached
to a portion of the endoplasmic reticulum sheet extending
through the entire thickness of the section; in this study
the width of the membrane sheet is estimated to be 1.2
times the section thickness of 400 A. The number of ribo￾somes can thus be related to an area of membrane (L
X 400 A X 1.2) which permits calculation of the number
of ribosomes per square micron of membrane (18). The
estimation of section thickness was obtained by the inter￾ference color method of Peachey (19), and the uniformity
of the section thickness can be attested to by the low
standard error (less than 5% of the mean) within the
control group (column 2, Table II). As before, measure￾ments were made by individuals who were not aware of
the identity of the photographs.
RESULTS
Separation of bound and free hepatic ribosomes. Bound
ribosomes were operationally defined as those ribosomes
contained in the 0.5 M sucrose layer after centrifugation
of a postmitochondrial supernate for 18 h at 105,000 g.
When [3H]phenylalanine-labeled bound ribosomes were
combined with normal carrier postmitochondrial super￾nate, layered over a sucrose gradient, and centrifuged,
the radioactive bound fractions were distributed as shown
in Fig. 1 (solid lines). 83±1%7 of the radioactivity is
found above the 2.0 M sucrose interface of the gradient,
while only 17% of the radioactivity is found in the 2.0
M sucrose layer. The distributions of labeled normal
and diabetic bound ribosome fractions were the same.
Furthermore, when labeled control or diabetic bound
ribosomes were combined with diabetic carrier post￾mitochondrial supernate, the results were the same as
those displayed in Fig. 1. Finally, results were identical
when the carrier supernate is prepared by either a 500 g
or 10,000 g centrifugation.
To estimate the purity of these bound ribosomes, the
0.5 M sucrose layer was removed and recentrifuged for
4 h at 105,000 g, and the pellet was fixed and examined
by electron microscopy. Purity of the bound ribosome
fraction was a function of the original supernate from
which the ribosomes were prepared. Bound fractions pre￾pared from an original 500 g supernate contained mito￾chondria, lysosomes, and other membranes. On the other
hand, lysosomes and mitochondria were only rarely seen
in preparations from the 10,000 g supernate, and there
appeared to be smaller fragments of RER than were seen
in the 500 g supernate.
Free ribosomes were defined operationally as those
labeled ribosomes contained in the pellet after the initial
centrifugation of the postmitochondrial supernate through
a discontinuous sucrose gradient. When [8H]phenylala￾nine-labeled free ribosomes from either normal or dia￾betic rat livers were combined with carrier postmito￾chondrial supernate and centrifuged through a discon￾tinuous sucrose gradient, the distribution of radioactivity
was as shown in Fig. 1 (interrupted lines). Although
a good fraction of the labeled free ribosomes were con￾tained in the pellet (43%), a highly significant fraction
of the total radioactivity was found in the 2.0 M sucrose
layer and would be discarded if just the pellet were taken
to represent the free ribosome population as is conven￾tionally done. On the other hand, a total of 82+2% 8 of
the radioactivity is found in the pellet and the 2.0 M
sucrose layer, and only 18% of the radioactivity of free
ribosomes is found above the 2.0 M interface. The per￾centage of radioactivity below the 2.0 M interface is the
same for normal and diabetic free ribosomes (Fig. 1)
and the distribution of radioactivity was the same when

carrier postmitochondrial supernate was obtained either
from normal or diabetic rats, or from a 500 g or 10,000 g
centrifugation. The fact that free ribosomes were pres￾ent in substantial numbers in the 2.0 M layer made it
essential that free ribosomes be harvested from both
pellet and 2.0 M layer. Not only does the 2.0 Ml sucrose
layer contain a significant portion of free ribosomes, but
it selectively contains monosomes, making the pellet
unrepresentative of the total free ribosome population.9
In order to evaluate the purity of the free ribosomal
population, the pellet of free ribosomes was resuspended
in the 2.0 M sucrose layer, diluted to 0.8 M sucrose,
repelleted, and examined by electron microscopy. The
ribosomes were uncontaminated by membrane structures,
mitochondria, or nuclear fragments, and this was true
of preparations from both 500 and 10,000 g supernates.
From these experiments, it appears that membrane￾bound and free ribosomes are each prepared in rela￾tive purity by the method employed in this paper and
that both ribosome populations are prepared with equal
efficiency from normal and acutely diabetic rats.
Recovery of bound and free hepatic ribosomes. Re￾coveries of bound and free hepatic ribosomes are shown
in Table I. Recovery of bound ribosomes from livers of
diabetic animals was significantly decreased as com￾pared to controls. This was true of pellets obtained from
both 500 and 10,000 g supernate. As expected, riboso￾mal recovery was greater from 500 g than 10,000 g su￾pernate, due to the fact that a larger fraction of the RER
centrifuges down with nuclei and mitochondria at the
higher sedimentation rate (3). Free ribosomes were re￾covered in equal amounts from livers of normal and dia￾betic rats, irrespective of the supernate from which they
were derived. The measured decrease in recovery of
bound ribosomes in diabetes is consistent wvith our previ￾ous observation that the amount of RER is decreased in
severe insulin deficiency (2).

deficiency by alloxan, and consist primarily of a loss of
glycogen, and accumulation of neutral fat, an enlarge￾ment of mitochondria, proliferation of the smooth endo￾plasmic reticulum, and marked disruption and disag￾gregation of the RER and its attendant population of
bound polyribosomes. It is this last abnormality which
we feel is responsible for the decrease in hepatic protein
synthesis that occurs in acute diabetes. The development
of these changes can be prevented by insulin replace￾ment after the administration of streptozotocin or al￾loxan (2).
To quantitatively assess the effect of acute insulin
deficiency on the amount of RER, we have estimated
the amount of RER present in hepatocytes. These re￾sults appear in Table II, column 1, and indicate that the
area of RER per volume of hepatocyte cytoplasm is
significantly reduced in rats with streptozotocin-induced
diabetes. This decrease in RER can be prevented by
the concomitant administration of insulin. The de￾crease in RER is quite comparable to that we have
earlier described in alloxan-treated rats (2) except that
each value has been doubled to account for the fact that
profiles of RER actually represent double membranes.

In an effort to assess quantitatively the effect of acute
insulin deficiency on the structural integrity of the
membrane :ribosome unit we have estimated the num￾ber of bound ribosomes per area of RER membrane
from hepatocytes of control rats and rats made diabetic
with streptozotocin. Representative micrographs of RER
from normal and diabetic rat liver are seen in Fig. 2.
In the diabetic hepatocyte (2b) it is noted that the
groups of ribosomes are separated by large gaps of
unoccupied membrane. The quantitative data are seen in
Table IT, column 2, and demonstrate that acute, severe
insulin deficiency results in a significant decrease in
the number of ribosomes per unit area of membrane.
Similar results are obtained when alloxan is used to
produce acute insulin deficiency. Insulin replacement
prevents this decrease. The proportion of ribosomes per
unit volume of cytoplasm can be derived from the data
of columns 1 and 2. In diabetic hepatocytes this figure is
seen to be approximately 30% of normal (Table II,
column 3) and this decrease is also prevented by the
concomitant administration of insulin.
Effect of acute insulin deficiency on polysomie profiles
of bound hepatic ribosomes. The size of the mRNA￾bound ribosomal aggregates can be estimated by study￾ing their distribution on linear sucrose gradients. The
results of such polysome profiles are seen in Fig. 3. The
peaks at the left of the profile represent smaller mRNA￾ribosomal aggregates and those to the right are indica￾tive of large mRNA-ribosomal aggregates. In order to
evaluate quantitatively these polysome profiles the area

aggregates (to the left of the dotted lines in Fig. 3). The
remainder of the polysome profile was taken to represent
larger polysome aggregates (greater than trimers). Area
under the "small" and "large" aggregate peaks was sepa￾rately measured by planimetry and expressed as a per￾centage of the total area. The data indicate that the effect
of acute diabetes on the bound ribosomal population is to
produce a decrease in proportion of larger mRNA￾ribosomal aggregates, with concomitant increase of
mono-, di-, and trisomes. This was true when bound
ribosomes were prepared from 500 g or 10,000 g super￾nates, and when acute insulin deficiency -was produced
by streptozotocin or alloxan.

t-om \DISCUSSION
FIGURE 5 Polysome profiles of free ribosomes prepared
from 500 g supernates from livers of normal and alloxan
diabetic rats. Percentage figures under the lef t half of
each tracing express the percentage of total area under the
profile of small ribosomal aggregates, while percentages at
the right ref er to the proportion of total area under the
tracing of larger ribosomal aggregates. Planimetry of five
paired samples from normal and diabetic rat livers revealed
no significant difference.
nally, the right-hand panel in Fig. 4 indicates that the
difference in protein-synthetic capacity of control and
diabetic bound polyribosomes is abolished when endoge￾nous mRNA is removed and artificial messenger polyU
substituted in its place. The results described were all
based upon study of bound polyribosomes derived from
the 500 g supernate. Comparable results were obtained
from an equal number of observations using 10,000 g
supernate from the alloxan-treated animals.
Effect of acute insulin deficiency on free hepatic
ribosomes. There was no detectable effect of acute dia￾betes on the electron microscopic appearance or on the
polysome profiles of free ribosomes (Fig. 5). This was
true regardless of the manner in which the diabetes was
produced, or whether the free ribosomes were prepared
from 500 or 10,000 g supernates.
However, acute diabetes did have a significant effect
on in vitro protein synthesis of isolated free hepatic
ribosomes. These results are shown in Fig. 6, and indi￾cate that in vitro protein synthetic activity was in￾creased in free polyribosomes from animals made dia￾betic with either alloxan or streptozotocin. As before,
the change in protein synthesis could be prevented by the
simultaneous administration of insulin. Since there was
no striking change in the ultrastructure or the polysome
profiles of the free ribosome population, the possibility
arose that the increase in protein synthesis by the free
ribosomal population might be due to a direct effect of
acute insulin deficiency to make ribosome more efficient
at copying mRNA. Furthermore, this increased effi￾ciency of translation might also be seen when free ribo￾somes are copying an artificial messenger. This pos￾sibilitv was tested by comparing polyU-stimulated amino
acid incorporation of normal and diabetic free ribosomes,
and the results appear in the right panel of Fig. 6. The
ratio of the protein-synthetic capacity of diabetic/nor￾The data presented in this paper suggest that the two
ribosomal populations in the liver are not only morpho￾logically distinct, but respond to experimental diabetes
mellitus in fundamentally different ways. The effects
of acute insulin deficiency on the membrane-bound ribo￾somes can be summarized as follows. There is marked
disaggregation and disruption of the RER, resulting in
a marked reduction in the total number of bound ribo￾somes per volume of cytoplasm.The decrease in the num￾ber of bound ribosomes is due to both a loss of RER and
to a decrease in the number of bound ribosomes per
area of RER membrane. Polysome profiles indicate
that the bound ribosomes remaining in the livers of
acutely diabetic rats have undergone a shift to smaller￾sized ribosomal mRNA aggregates. Furthermore, the
protein-synthetic activity of these bound ribosomes is
decreased per milligram of ribosomal RNA. Since
smaller ribosomal aggregates copy less message and in￾corporate less amino acid into protein in vitro (15, 20),

the shift to smaller-sized ribosomal mRNA aggregates
provides an explanation for the observed reduction in
protein-synthetic activity of the bound ribosomes. Fi￾nally, when endogenous mRNA was removed, and pro￾tein synthesis directed by artificial messenger, there
was no longer any difference in the protein-synthetic ac￾tivity of bound ribosomes from livers of normal and
diabetic rats. These experimental findings are internally
consistent and strongly suggest that the decrease in pro￾tein-synthetic activity of bound hepatic ribosomes from
acutely diabetic rats is secondary to marked disruption
of the RER, with production of smaller ribosomal
mRNA aggregates which are less active in protein syn￾thesis.
In contrast are the effects of acute insulin deficiency
on ribosomes free in the cytosol. The free ribosomes do
not appear to be reduced in quantity, they do not seem
to be broken down into smaller aggregates, and they are
not less active in incorporating amino acid into protein.
Indeed, free hepatic ribosomes from diabetic animals are
more active than normal in amino acid incorporation,
and this is true when protein synthesis was directed by
either natural mRNA or polyU. Since the polysome pro￾files indicate that there is no difference in the degree of
aggregation of ribosomes and mRNA, the increased
protein synthetic activity of free ribosomes prepared
from diabetic liver may not be due to changes in the
amount of mRNA. The finding that diabetic free ribo￾somes are more active than normal in amino acid in￾corporation directed by artificial mRNA (polyU) raises
the possibility that diabetic free ribosomes are intrinsi￾cally more efficient in copying messenger. This hypothe￾sis also provides an explanation for the increased amino
acid incorporation of diabetic ribosomes directed by
endogenous mRNA.
Before dealing with the physiological implications of
these studies, a methodological problem inherent in
these experiments must be considered. The method of
isolating free and bound ribosomes from homogenized
liver does not quantitatively recover all ribosomes.
While free ribosomes are quantitatively recovered by
this method, the recovery of bound ribosomes is reduced
(3). Less than quantitative recovery means that the
population of ribosomes studied may not be representa￾tive of the total population in vivo. For this reason,
free and bound ribosomes were isolated from both a 500
g supernate and 10,000 g supernate. The 500 g super￾nate allows a larger recovery of bound ribosomes, but
the preparation is contaminated by mitochondria and
lysosomes. A 10,000 g supernate contains a smaller
fraction of the bound ribosomes, but the sample is much
more pure, with no evidence of contaminating mito￾chondria or lysosomes. The fact that the experimental
results are identical with ribosomes isolated from either
a 500 g or a 10,000 g supernate increases the likelihood
that the results are applicable to the in vivo population of
ribosomes. In addition, the ultrastructural changes ob￾served in hepatocytes obtained from intact animals be￾fore the isolation procedure are consistent with the
in vitro results. However, considerable caution must be
exercised in applying the results of in vitro studies to
events in the living cell. The level of protein synthesis
in vivo obviously reflects the interplay of many fac￾tors; ribosomes, transfer RNA, amino acids, soluble
cytosol factors, and membrane phenomena, among others.
In view of the pronounced effects of these factors (21,
22) on protein synthesis, it will be necessary to evaluate
their changes before the in vivo status of protein synthe￾sis in diabetic liver can be fully understood. On the
other hand, these studies do demonstrate that membrane￾bound and free hepatic ribosomes respond in opposite
directions by different mechanisms to the altered physi￾ologic state of acute insulin deficiency, and it appears
that these two ribosomal populations are separately
controlled. We feel it is highly likely that these changes
represent a direct effect of insulin lack on hepatic ultra￾structure. However, it should be noted that although
food intake in the two groups was similar, we did not
correct for the calorie loss via glycosuria in the diabetic
rats and the degree of calorie loss could conceivably ef￾fect the results.
Regardless of the specific mechanisms invoked to ex￾plain the divergent effects of acute diabetes on bound
and free ribosomes, the question as to the potential
physiological significance of these disparate effects re￾mains to be considered. It seems reasonable to assume
that the overall impact of acute diabetes on hepatic pro￾tein synthesis will be related to the manner in which
insulin deficiency directly affects bound and free ribo￾somes, to the different roles fulfilled by the two ribo￾somal populations under normal conditions, and to the
metabolic response of the liver to the acute diabetic syn￾drome. The major effect of acute diabetes on the bound
ribosomal population seems to be directly related to the
extensive destruction of the RER. The ensuing decrease
in protein synthesis would be expected to primarily in.
volve proteins synthesized for export (5-8), and a loss
of this function might not be excessively detrimental to
the rat during the short time course of these studies.
In contrast, the increase in protein-synthetic capacity
of the free ribosomal population is possibly best ex￾plained by viewing it as a response to the development
of acute insulin deficiency. Specifically, if the free ribo￾somal population normally synthesizes protein for in￾tracellular use, it is possible that the accelerated gluco￾neogenesis required for survival (23, 24) would lead
Bound and Free Ribosomes from Insulin-Deficient Rats 3209

to increased synthetic activity of free ribosomes in order
to meet the demand for new intracellular protein, e.g.,
gluconeogenic enzymes.
The complex nature of the effect of acute insulin
deficiency on hepatic protein synthesis should not be too
surprising, as it is already apparent that acute diabetes
modifies protein synthesis differently in different organs.
For example, muscle ribosomes from diabetic rats, which
are essentially all free, shown decreased protein-synthetic
activity (25). In contrast, kidney ribosomes from acutely
diabetic rats, which are also predominantly free in the
cytosol, show increased protein-synthetic activity (13).
Thus, at this time there does not appear to be a con￾sistent effect of acute diabetes on protein synthesis, nor
does there appear to be any unifying hypothesis to ex￾plain the divergent effects.
Finally, it must be emphasized that these results were
seen after 2-3 days of severe insulin deficiency. They
were not dependent upon the mode of producing ex￾perimental diabetes, and all the changes could be pre￾vented by administering insulin concomitantly with the
diabetogenic agent. Thus, the results seem to be a specific
reflection of acute insulin deficiency. However, the de￾gree of insulin deficiency was extremely severe, and
these animals barely survived the experimental period.
Therefore, quite different results might be seen after
the production of more chronic, and less severe, insulin
deficiency. This seems to be the case in the studies of
Pilkis and Korner (26), in which there was a decrease
in protein synthesis by isolated free ribosomes after
alloxan diabetes of greater than 1 mo duration. It
should be noted, however, that bound ribosomes were
not prepared separately in that study. The apparent dis￾crepancy between the effects of acute and chronic in￾sulin deficiency on heaptic protein synthesis requires
further elucidation, and we are currently studying this
problem.
