Abstract
Background: Recently, considerable attention has been focused on exploring the potential antioxidant properties
of plant extracts or isolated products of plant origin. Prunella vulgaris var. lilacina is widely distributed in Korea,
Japan, China, and Europe, and it continues to be used to treat inflammation, eye pain, headache, and dizziness.
However, reports on the antioxidant activities of P. vulgaris var. lilacina are limited, particularly concerning the
relationship between its phenolic content and antioxidant capacity. In this study, we investigated the antioxidant
and anticancer activities of an ethanol extract from P. vulgaris var. lilacina and its fractions.
Methods: Dried powder of P. vulgaris var. lilacina was extracted with ethanol, and the extract was fractionated to
produce the hexane fraction, butanol fraction, chloroform fraction and residual water fraction. The phenolic content
was assayed using the Folin-Ciocalteu colorimetric method. Subsequently, the antioxidant activities of the ethanol
extract and its fractions were analyzed employing various antioxidant assay methods including DPPH, FRAP, ABTS,
SOD activity and production of reactive oxygen species. Additionally, the extract and fractions were assayed for their
ability to exert cytotoxic activities on various cancer cells using the MTT assay. We also investigated the expression
of genes associated with apoptotic cell death by RT-PCR.
Results: The total phenolic contents of the ethanol extract and water fraction of P. vulgaris var. lilacina were 303.66
and 322.80 mg GAE/g dry weight (or fractions), respectively. The results showed that the ethanol extract and the
water fraction of P. vulgaris var. lilacina had higher antioxidant content than other solvent fractions, similar to their
total phenolic content. Anticancer activity was also tested using the HepG2, HT29, A549, MKN45 and HeLa cancer
cell lines. The results clearly demonstrated that the P. vulgaris var. lilacina ethanol extract induced significant cytotoxic
effects on the various cancer cell lines, and these effects were stronger than those induced by the P. vulgaris var. lilacina
solvent fractions. We also investigated the expression of genes associated with apoptotic cell death. We confirmed that
the P. vulgaris var. lilacina ethanol extract and water fraction significantly increased the expression of p53, Bax and Fas.
Conclusions: These results suggest that the ethanol extract from P. vulgaris var. lilacina and its fractions could be
applied as natural sources of antioxidants and anticancer activities in food and in the pharmaceutical industry.

Background
Oxidative stress is caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS),
which are associated with many pathological disorders
such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, ageing and cancer [1-3].
In order to protect human beings against oxidative damage,
synthetic antioxidants such as BHA and BHT were created
due to demand [4]. However, there has been concern
regarding the toxicity and carcinogenic effects of synthetic
antioxidants [5,6]. Thus, it is important to identify new
sources of safe and inexpensive antioxidants of natural
origin. Natural antioxidants, especially plant phenolics,
flavonoids, tannins and anthocyanidins, are safe and are
also bioactive [7]. Therefore, in recent years, considerable
attention has been focused on exploring the potential
antioxidant properties of plant extracts or isolated products
of plant origin [8].
Prunella vulgaris var. lilacina is widely distributed in
Korea, Japan, China, and Europe, and it continues to be
used to treat inflammation, eye pain, headache, and

dizziness [9,10]. It is rich in active compounds known
to significantly affect human health, such as triterpenoid,
rosmarinic acid, hyperoside, ursolic acid, and flavonoids
[11-16]. Furthermore, P. vulgaris var. lilacina has been
shown to have anti-allergic, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxida￾tive, anti-microbial, and anti-viral effects [17-19]. However,
reports on the antioxidant activities of P. vulgaris var.
lilacina are limited, particularly concerning the relation￾ship between its phenolic content and antioxidant capacity.
Therefore, the aims of this study were to identify new
sources of antioxidants from P. vulgaris var. lilacina extract.
Additionally, the effects of the extraction solvent (70%
ethanol, hexane, butanol, chloroform, or water) on the total
phenolic content and antioxidant activities of P. vulgaris
var. lilacina were investigated.
Methods
Reagents
The reagents 1,1-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2′-
azinibis 3-ethyl benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS),
α-tocopherol, 2,4,6-tris(2-pyridyl)-s-triazine (TPTZ), iron
(III) chloride hexahydrate, gallic acid, Folin and Ciocalteu’s
phenol reagent, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl￾tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).
Iron(II) sulfate heptahydrate and acetic acid were purchased
from Junsei (Tokyo, Japan). A superoxide dismutase-WST
kit was purchased from Dojindo (Kumamoto, Japan). Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM), RPMI 1640 medium,
fetal bovine serum (FBS), and penicillin–streptomycin
were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Sample preparation and extraction
Whole plants of P. vulgaris var. lilacina were purchased
from the Plant Extract Bank (#007-017, Dae-Jeon, Korea).
Dried P. vulgaris var. lilacina was milled into powder of
80-mesh particle size and stored at -70°C. The dried P.
vulgaris var. lilacina was extracted three times with 70%
ethanol. The 70% ethanol extract powder (10 g) was
suspended in 500 mL of distilled water and extracted with
500 mL of the following solvents in a stepwise manner:
hexane, chloroform, and butanol. Each fraction was filtered
through Whatman filter paper No. 2 (Advantec, Tokyo,
Japan). Subsequently, the filtrates were combined and
evaporated under a vacuum and then lyophilized with a
freeze dryer (Ilshine Lab, Suwon, Korea) at -70°C under
reduced pressure (< 20 Pa). The dry residue was stored
at -20°C. For further analysis, we reconstituted the dry
extract and fractions with DMSO.
Total phenolic content
The total phenolic contents of P. vulgaris var. lilacina
extract and its fractions were determined using the Folin￾Ciocalteu method [20]. The extract and each fraction were
oxidized with Folin–Ciocalteu’s reagents, and then, the
reaction was neutralized with 10% sodium carbonate.
After incubation at room temperature for 1 h, the absorb￾ance of the reaction mixture was measured at 725 nm using
a microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA,
USA). Quantification was performed based on a standard
curve with gallic acid. Results were expressed as milligrams
gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per gram of dry weight of
extract (or fractions).
DPPH radical scavenging activity
Analysis of DPPH radical-scavenging activity was carried
out according to the Blois method [21]. 0.3 mM DPPH was
added to each sample. After incubation for 30 min in the
dark at room temperature, the absorbance was measured at
518 nm using a microplate reader. α-Tocopherol was used
as a positive control. Percent reduction of the DPPH radical
was calculated in the following way: inhibition concentra￾tion (%) = 100 - (Asample/Acontrol) × 100,
where Acontrol is the absorbance of the control reaction
(containing all reagents except the test sample), and
Asample is the absorbance of the test sample. Tests were
carried out in triplicate. For the final results, RC50 values
(the concentrations required for 50% reduction of DPPH
by 30 min after starting the reaction) were calculated from
the absorbance diminished by 50%. The experiment was
performed in triplicate.
Ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) activity
FRAP activity was determined using manual assay methods
[22]. The working fluid was freshly prepared by mixing
acetate buffer (300 mM, pH 3.6) with TPTZ in HCl and
iron (III) chloride hexahydrate. Each sample solution or
α-tocopherol was added to 3 mL of working fluid, and
the mixture was left for 4 min at room temperature.
The absorbance was measured at 593 nm. The results
were expressed as iron (II) sulfate heptahydrate (FeSO4)
equivalents.

ABTS radical cation scavenging activity
The ABTS assay was based on the ability of different frac￾tions to scavenge the ABTS radical cation in comparison
to a standard (α-tocopherol) [23]. The radical cation was
prepared by mixing 7 mM ABTS with 2.45 mM potassium
persulfate (1:1 v/v) and leaving the mixture for 24 h until
the reaction was completed and the absorbance was
stable. The ABTS radical solution was diluted with PBS to
an absorbance of 0.7 ± 0.02 at 732 nm. The photometric
assay was conducted with 180 μL of ABTS radical solution
and 20 μL of samples; measurements were taken at 732 nm
after 1 min. The antioxidative activity of the tested samples
was calculated by determining the decrease in absorbance.
The free radical scavenging capacity was expressed by
RC50.
Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity
Superoxide dismutase activity was determined using the
highly water-soluble tetrazolium salt WST-1, which pro￾duces a water-soluble formazan dye upon reduction with a
superoxide anion. SOD activity was determined using an
SOD assay kit (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) in accordance
with the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, WST working
solution was made by diluting 1 mL of WST solution into
19 ml of buffer solution. Enzyme working solution was
made after the enzyme solution tube was centrifuged for 5
sec. Fifteen microliters of enzyme solution were diluted
with 2.5 mL of dilution buffer. SOD activity was expressed
as the percentage of inhibition rate.
Cells and culture
The mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7, human liver
cancer cell line HepG2, human colon cancer cell line
HT29, human lung cancer cell line A549, human stomach
cancer cell line MKN-45 and human cervical cancer cell
line HeLa were purchased from the Korean Cell Line
Bank (Seoul, Korea). The cell lines were grown in RPMI
1640 medium or DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin￾streptomycin and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2.
Cell cytotoxicity assay
Exponentially growing cells were collected and plated at
5 × 103 - 1 × 104 cells/well. P. vulgaris var. lilacina ethanol
extract and its solvent fractions in DMSO were diluted in
PBS to obtain final concentrations of 10, 50 and 100 μg/mL.
Cells were treated with samples for 24 h, and MTT solu￾tion was added. After 4 h, the media was removed, and
DMSO was added to each well. The resulting absorbance
was measured at 540 nm [24].
Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS)
scavenging activity
For microscopic detection of ROS formation, RAW264.7
cells were grown to 80% confluence in six-well plates and
treated with samples for 24 h. After incubation, cells were
incubated with dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA)
(25 μM) for 30 min at 37°C in the dark. After several
washings with PBS, cells were observed with a fluorescence
microscope (Carl ZEISS, Oberkochen, Germany).
Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
analysis (RT-PCR)
To determine the expression levels of p53, Bax, Bcl-2 and
Fas, RT-PCR was performed using a Qiagen Rotor-Gene Q
real-time thermal cycler (Valencia, CA, USA) in accordance
with the manufacturer’s instructions. The cells were treated
with P. vulgaris var. lilacina extracts and cultured for 24 h.

Thereafter, cDNA was synthesized from the total RNA
isolated from cells. The PCR reaction was performed using
2× SYBR Green mix (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). All
results were normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate

Gas chromatography-mass spectrum analysis (GC-MS)
GC-MS analysis was carried out using an Agilent 6890
gas chromatograph equipped with a DB-5 ms capillary
column (60 m × 0.25 mm; coating thickness 1.4 μm)
and an Agilent 5975 MSD detector (Loveland, CO, USA).
Analytical conditions were as follows: injector and transfer
line temperatures of 250°C; oven temperature was pro￾grammed from 50°C to 150°C at 10°C/min, from 150°C
to 200°C at 7°C/min, and from 200°C to 250°C at 5°C/min;
carrier gas helium at 1 mL/min; and split ratio 1:10. Iden￾tification of the constituents was based on comparison of
the retention times with those of authentic samples.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS (version 17.0;
SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive statistics were
used to calculate the mean and standard error of the mean
(SEM). One-way analysis of variance was performed, and
when the significance (p < 0.05) was determined, the differ￾ences of the mean values were identified using Duncan’s
multiple range tests.

Total phenolic content
The total phenolic content of the P. vulgaris var. lilacina
extract and its fractions were determined through a linear
gallic acid standard curve and expressed as mg GAE/g dry
weight of extract (or fractions). As shown Table 1, the
total phenolic content of all fractions from P. vulgaris var.
lilacina varied from 109.31 to 322.80 mg GAE/g. The
highest total phenolic content was detected in the water
fraction (322.80 ± 15.12 mg GAE/g), whereas the lowest
content was found in the hexane fraction (109.31 ± 4.08
mg GAE/g). Phenolic compounds are reported to be asso￾ciated with antioxidant activity, anticancer effects, and other
biological functions and may prevent the development of
aging and disease [25]. These results suggest that P. vulgaris
var. lilacina extracts might have high antioxidant and
anticancer activities.
Antioxidant capacities of prunella vulgaris var. Lilacina
Results of the radical scavenging capacities determined
by DPPH, FRAP, ABTS and SOD assays are shown in
Table 2. In the DPPH assay, the DPPH radical scaven￾ging activity of all fractions from P. vulgaris var. lilacina
extract increased as shown in Table 2; the RC50 values
of radical scavenging activity for DPPH were found to be
73.05 ± 10.32, 1402.96 ± 194.46, 83.52 ± 7.01, 521.58 ± 8.10,
64.26 ± 2.22, and 12.82 ± 1.33 μg/mL for ethanol extract,
hexane, butanol, chloroform, water fractions and α-tocoph￾erol, respectively. The water fraction showed the highest
DPPH radical-scavenging activity. The DPPH scavenging
activity of all fractions showed a similar trend to the
content of total phenolic compounds. The FRAP assay
measures total antioxidant activity based on the reduction
of the ferric tripyridyltriazine (Fe3+-TPTZ) complex to the
ferrous form. The ferric complex reducing abilities of differ￾ent fractions were similar to the results obtained for the rad￾ical scavenging assay; water fraction exhibited very strong
ferric ion reducing activity, and the five fractions in descend￾ing order of strength of ferric ion reducing activity were
water fraction > ethanol extract > butanol > chloroform >
hexane fraction. In terms of the ABTS assay, the water
fraction demonstrated the highest scavenging activity,
followed by the ethanol extract, butanol fraction, chloro￾form fraction and hexane fraction, and these trends was
similar to those of the DPPH and FRAP assays. For the
results of the SOD activity assay, most fractions with the
exception of hexane exhibited very high SOD activity simi￾lar to α-tocopherol (99.64 ± 2.45%). However, there was no
significant different among the fractions.
DPPH, FRAP, ABTS and SOD assays are widely used to
determine the antioxidant capacity of plant extracts due to
their simplicity, stability, and reproducibility [26]. In this
study, the DPPH, FRAP, ABTS and SOD assays provided

comparable results for the antioxidant capacity measured
in P. vulgaris var. lilacina extract and its fractions. The P.
vulgaris var. lilacina extract and its fractions exhibited
strong antioxidant activities against various oxidative
systems in vitro. The strong antioxidant activity of a plant
extract is correlated with a high content of total phenols
[27,28]. In our research, we observed that the P. vulgaris
var. lilacina extract and its fractions that contained higher
phenol content exerted stronger radical scavenging effects
(Table 3). The correlations between the antioxidant assays,
such as DPPH, FRAP, ABTS and SOD activity and
phenolic content, were highly positive (0.759 < │r│ < 0.993,
p < 0.01), indicating that the four assays provided compar￾able values when they were used to estimate the antioxidant
capacity of P. vulgaris var. lilacina extract. Many studies
have shown a good positive linear correlation between anti￾oxidant capacity and the total phenolic content of spices,
medicinal herbs, and other dietary plants. Moreover, these
results have also suggested that phenolic compounds are
responsible for their antioxidant capacity [29-31].
Intracellular ROS scavenging activity
To investigate the intracellular levels of ROS, the cell￾permeable probe DCF-DA was utilized. Non-fluorescent
DCF-DA, hydrolyzed to DCFH inside the cells, yields
highly fluorescent DCF-DA in the presence of intracellular
hydrogen peroxide and related peroxides [32]. We ex￾amined whether P. vulgaris var. lilacina extract and its
fractions inhibited LPS-induced ROS generation. As shown
in Figure 1, LPS treatment significantly increased ROS
formation in RAW264.7 cells as determined by DCF
fluorescence. However, treatment with P. vulgaris var.
lilacina extract and its fractions blocked LPS-induced
ROS generation similar to the results obtained for the
antioxidant assays.
Cell cytotoxicity activity
In order to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of all samples, we
performed a preliminary cytotoxicity study with RAW264.7
cells exposed to various sample concentrations (10, 50, or
100 μg/mL). The P. vulgaris var. lilacina ethanol extract
(at 50 and 100 μg/mL), hexane fraction (at 100 μg/mL)
and chloroform fraction (at 50 and 100 μg/mL) inhibited
cell proliferation, but did not at a concentration of 10
μg/mL (Figure 2). Conversely, the groups treated with
10 μg/mL of ethanol extract or butanol fraction or treated
with 10, 50 and 100 μg/mL of the water fraction showed a
proliferative effect of over 10%. Macrophages are special￾ized phagocytic cells that attack foreign substances and
cancer cells through destruction and ingestion. They also
stimulate lymphocytes and other immune cells to respond
to pathogens [33]. These results suggest that the ethanol
extract, butanol and water fractions of P. vulgaris var.
lilacina can be used in the treatment of cancer. Based on
this result, we determined the appropriate concentration
to be 10 μg/mL.
Involvement of free radical-mediated cell damage in
many different diseases, particularly cancer, led us to
evaluate the cytotoxic activities of the ethanol extract and
the water fraction of P. vulgaris var. lilacina against five
human cancer cell lines (liver, HepG2; colon, HT29; lung,
A549; stomach, MKN-45; and cervical, HeLa) (Figure 3).
The ethanol extract and the water fraction of P. vulgaris
var. lilacina were most effective on A549 out of all the
cancer cell lines; their values were 32.4 and 28.7% at 10
μg/mL, respectively.
In the present study, the results clearly demonstrate
that the P. vulgaris var. lilacina ethanol extract induced
significant cytotoxic effects on the various cancer cell lines
studies, and these effects were stronger than for the P.
vulgaris var. lilacina solvent fractions. It may be difficult
to determine the contribution of individual components
on the overall anticancer effects. In the literature, it has
been reported that P. vulgaris var. lilacina components
such as ursolic acid and rosmarinic acid are responsible for
anticancer activities. Woo et al. [34] reported significant
apoptogenic activity of 2α,3α-dihydroxyurs-12-ene-28-oic
acid in Jurkat T cells. Lee et al. [35] and Hsu et al. [36]
explored the cytotoxic effects of ursolic acid. Psotova
et al. [37] found that rosmarinic acid from P. vulgaris var.
lilacina exhibited strong anticancer activity. In the present
study, we have isolated various presumed active compounds
from the ethanol extract of P. vulgaris var. lilacina (Figures 4
and 5). The spectrum profile of GC-MS confirmed the
presence of 7 major components, which were hexadeca￾noic acid, ethyl palmitate, lioleic acid, (z,z,z)-9,12,15-octa￾decatrienoic acid, ethyl (9E, 12E)-9,12-octadecadienoate,
(z,z,z)-ethyl ester-9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid, and ethyl

linoleolate. Lai et al. [38] reported significant antitumor
effects of fatty acids such as hexadecanoic acid and ethyl
palmitate obtained from plant extracts. Taken together,
the anticancer activity of ethanol extract may be the result
of the synergistic effects of various compounds in P.
vulgaris var. lilacina, which suggests that P. vulgaris var.
lilacina can be used as a biological agent in the treatment
of cancer.
Real-time RT-PCR analysis
We assessed whether P. vulgaris var. lilacina ethanol
extract and the water fraction affected the expression of
genes associated with apoptotic cell death, including the
tumor suppressor p53,pro-apoptotic Bax, the anti-apop￾totic Bcl-2 and Fas genes in A549 cells. p53-mediated
apoptosis primarily occurs through the intrinsic apoptotic
program [39]. It was reported that p53 induces apoptosis
by either increasing transcriptional activity of proapoptotic
genes such as Bax or suppressing the activity of the antia￾poptotic genes of the Bcl-2 family [40]. Our data show
that P. vulgaris var. lilacina ethanol extract and the water
fraction significantly increased the expression of p53, Bax
and Fas compared to the control. However, the expression
of Bcl-2 was not decreased compared to that of the control
(Figure 6). Therefore, the treatments altered the expression
of Bax/Bcl-2, resulting in a shift in their ratio favoring
apoptosis. Several other groups have shown in various
cancer cell lines that P. vulgaris var. lilacina can lead to
cell death by inducing apoptosis through regulation of
p53 and Bax/Bcl-2 expression [41]. In our study, the
resulting elevation in p53 and Bax protein expression in
lung cancer cells is consistent with our earlier proposed
involvement of p53 and Bax-related response systems.
Taken together, we suggest that P. vulgaris var. lilacina
ethanol extract and water fraction induce apoptosis
through the regulation of p53, Bax, and Fas expression.
Conclusions
The present study determined that P. vulgaris var. lilacina
extract and its fractions have strong antioxidant and
anticancer activities in vitro. The correlation coefficients
between antioxidant capacity and the phenolic content
were very strong, and phenolic compounds were a major
contributor to the antioxidant capacities of P. vulgaris var.
lilacina.
In addition, we confirmed the presence of 7 major
components of P. vulgaris var. lilacina. However, further
studies to study the mechanisms of these compounds and
find the root of their antioxidative and anticancer activity
are underway. On the basis of these results, P. vulgaris var.
lilacina appears to be a good source of natural antioxidant
and anticancer agents and could be of significance in
the food industry and for the control of various human
and animal diseases.
