Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most com￾mon chronic liver disease and encompasses a spectrum of 
pathology from simple steatosis to inflammation and signifi￾cant fibrosis that leads to cirrhosis. NAFLD and its comorbid 
conditions extend well beyond the liver. It is a multisystemic 
clinical disease entity with extrahepatic manifestations such 
as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney 
disease, hypothyroidism, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and 
psoriasis. Indeed, the most common causes of mortality in 
subjects with NAFLD are cardiovascular disease, followed by 
malignancies and then liver-related complications as a dis￾tant third. This review focuses on several of the key extrahe￾patic manifestations of NAFLD and areas for future investiga￾tion. Clinicians should learn to screen and initiate treatment 
for these extrahepatic manifestations in a prompt and timely 
fashion before they progress to end-organ damage. (Gut

INTRODUCTION
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is defined by the 
presence of hepatic steatosis in the absence of other causes for 
hepatic fat accumulation, most commonly significant alcohol 
use, medications and other causes of chronic liver disease. 
NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of liver disease ranging from 
isolated hepatic steatosis characterized by intrahepatic triglycer￾ide accumulation (nonalcoholic fatty liver, NAFL), steatosis with 
inflammation and hepatocyte injury (nonalcoholic steatohepa￾titis, NASH), NASH with fibrosis that can progress to end-stage 
liver disease (NASH-related cirrhosis), and potentially hepato￾cellular carcinoma. NAFLD has become increasingly common, 
with estimates of prevalence in the United States ranging from 
10% to 46%1-3 and worldwide up to 25%.1,4 Its rise in prevalence 
has closely paralleled with metabolic syndrome and individual 
components of metabolic syndrome such as central obesity, 
dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).5
 Although 
NAFLD is sometimes perceived as the hepatic manifestation of 
the metabolic syndrome, there is now a growing body of evi￾dence that NAFLD may, in fact, be a key driver in metabolic 
syndrome. The hepatic involvement is just one component of a 
multi-organ manifestation of NAFLD, with effects on the car￾diovascular, renal, and endocrine systems, as well as the risk of 
extrahepatic malignancies. In fact, the leading cause of mortal￾ity in patients with NAFLD is cardiovascular disease, followed 
by extrahepatic malignancies, and then liver-related mortal￾ity.6,7 Therefore, physicians and patients should be aware of the 
multisystemic involvement of NAFLD without a clear pattern or 
order of clinical presentation. Therefore, a high level of clinical 
suspicion based on a patient risk profile is the most prudent ap￾proach. Widespread screening for NAFLD is not recommended 
at this time. This review will focus on the association between 
NAFLD and metabolic syndrome and the extrahepatic manifes￾tations of NAFLD (Table 1).
METABOLIC SYNDROME
The metabolic syndrome is typically defined by the presence 
of at least three of following risk factors: central obesity, high 
blood pressure, high blood sugar, high serum triglycerides, and 
low serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The metabolic 
syndrome is highly prevalent in subjects with NAFLD. The 
prevalence of metabolic syndrome increased with increasing 
body mass index (BMI), from 18% in nonobese NAFLD to 67% 
in obese-NAFLD in 304 subjects with NAFLD.8
 Eighty-eight per￾cent of subjects with NASH had metabolic syndrome (vs 53% 
of subjects with NAFL).8
 The presence of metabolic syndrome 
carried a high risk of NASH and severe fibrosis among subjects

with NAFLD after correction for sex, age, and BMI.8
 A recent 
study from the NASH Clinical Research Network reported that 
metabolic syndrome had a 40% increased risk of histology￾confirmed NASH.9
 In an analysis using the National Health and 
Nutrition Examination and Survey (NHANES) III, the metabolic 
syndrome was independently associated with increased risk of 
overall mortality among subjects with NAFLD, although obesity 
was not associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality 
in subjects with NAFLD.10
There may be a bidirectional relationship as well, with a study 
of approximately 1,000 participants of the Framingham Heart 
Study identifying that those with NAFLD at baseline were at 
higher risk to develop subsequent hypertension and T2DM than 
those without NAFLD, and those with elements of the metabolic 
syndrome were more likely to develop incident NAFLD.11 Kwon 
et al.
12 showed that NAFLD was associated with a risk of having 
components of metabolic syndrome, and the association was 
stronger for nonobese NAFLD than for obese NAFLD. A meta￾analysis reported that NAFLD, as diagnosed by either liver en￾zymes or ultrasonography, significantly increased the risk of in￾cident metabolic syndrome during a 5-year follow-up period.13
In a pooled population of 81,411, NAFLD was associated with 
increased risk of incident metabolic syndrome with a relative 
risk of 1.80 for alanine aminotransferase (last vs first quartile 
or quintile), 1.98 for gamma-glutamyltransferase, and 3.22 for 
ultrasonography.13
VISCERAL ADIPOSITY
The prevalence of NAFL on biopsy in patients undergoing 
bariatric surgery for morbid obesity ranges up to 90%; NASH 
was seen in 30% to 50%, and up to 5% had cirrhosis.14-17 In 
addition, visceral adiposity appears to confer a higher risk for 
NAFLD compared to subcutaneous fat deposition. A longitudi￾nal study of approximately 2,000 subjects identified that larger 
areas of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) at baseline was associated 
with higher incident NAFLD, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.23 in 
the highest quintile after adjusting for other factors, whereas an 
association with subcutaneous adipose tissue was nonexistent.18
In contrast, higher areas of subcutaneous adipose tissue were 
longitudinally associated with regression of NAFLD.18 Increases 
in VAT area over time also correlate higher likelihood of inci￾dent NAFLD, while a decrease in VAT over time was correlated 
with the likelihood of regressed NAFLD.19 Within NAFLD, VAT 
area also predicts the likelihood of NAFL, NASH, and NAFLD 
with fibrosis, with higher areas of VAT associated with more 
advanced liver disease.20 In summary, these data indicate that 
certain types of body fat are risk factors for NAFLD, whereas 
other types could reduce the risk for NAFLD. Visceral obesity is 
most likely an important target for future interventions in the 
treatment of NAFLD and advanced fibrosis.
TYPE 2 DIABETES
NAFLD and T2DM share common pathogenic pathways in￾cluding obesity and insulin resistance. NAFLD is insulin resis￾tant and therefore does not adequately suppress hepatic glucose 
production, and patients with both T2DM and NAFLD often 
have poor glycemic control, as compared to those with only 
T2DM without NAFLD.21,22 A recent meta-analysis in a pooled 
population of 296,439 subjects determined that NAFLD signifi￾cantly increased the risk of incident T2DM with a pooled HR 
Table 1. Key Extrahepatic Manifestations of NAFLD
Extrahepatic manifestation Key finding
Metabolic syndrome Increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome with progression of NAFLD, NASH, and severe fibrosis (18%–88%)
Presence of metabolic syndrome associated with higher overall mortality in NAFLD
Visceral adiposity Visceral adiposity carries a higher risk than subcutaneous adiposity for NAFLD
Type 2 diabetes Insulin resistance is a common pathogenic mechanism for both type 2 diabetes and NAFLD, and more "severe" 
NAFLD is more likely to have incident diabetes
Presence of type 2 diabetes in NAFLD increases mortality by 2.2-fold, and NAFLD increases the risk of micro￾vascular diabetic complications 
Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease is the primary cause of mortality in NAFLD, with multiple associations with cardiovas￾cular disease events and subclinical markers
More "severe" forms of NAFLD associated with higher risk of cardiovascular disease events and mortality 
Chronic kidney disease More "severe" NAFLD increases the likelihood of renal impairment, and improvement in hepatic disease may 
also improve renal function
Hypothyroidism Subclinical and overt hypothyroidism link with NAFLD
Psoriasis High prevalence of concurrent NAFLD and NASH in psoriasis
Polycystic ovarian syndrome Polycystic ovarian syndrome and NAFLD share common risk factors in obesity and insulin resistance

of 2.22 (95% confidence intervals [CI], 1.84 to 2.60).23 Subjects 
with more “severe” NAFLD were also more likely to develop 
incident diabetes.23 However, there are likely complex bidirec￾tional links between the two diseases. Approximately 75% of 
subjects with T2DM have concurrent NAFLD, and the diagnosis 
of NAFLD in subjects with T2DM increases the risk of all-cause 
mortality by 2.2-fold.24 Microvascular diabetic complications 
are also seen at higher rates in T2DM patients with concurrent 
NAFLD as compared to those without, with higher rates of both 
diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy.25-27 T2DM also appears to 
exert effects on the progression of NAFLD, with incident T2DM 
being the most predictive factor for progression of NAFLD to 
NASH and advanced fibrosis.28
CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortal￾ity in patients with NAFLD. Classical CVD risk factors such as 
hypertension, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, smoking, and 
central obesity, share a strong overlap with both the metabolic 
syndrome and risk factors for NAFLD.8
 These shared risk factors, 
many encapsulated by the metabolic syndrome, intimately link 
CVD and NAFLD, but there is growing evidence that the pres￾ence of NAFLD confers additional risk of premature CVD. This 
has potentially important clinical implications for risk factor 
reduction and screening. Additional shared risk factors between 
NAFLD and CVD are also emerging, along with altered levels of 
interleukin 6, adiponectin, tumor necrosis factor alpha, vitamin 
D, fibrinogen, plasminogen, vascular adhesion molecules, and 
C-reactive protein, with many of these being liver-synthesized 
proteins (Table 2).25,29-51
A large body of evidence links NAFLD with atherosclerotic 
plaque formation and subclinical markers of CVD.52 Several 
cross-sectional studies linked NAFLD with increased carotid in￾tima-media thickness, a well-validated tool for assessing athero￾sclerosis in asymptomatic patients that independently predicts 
CVD events.53-55 A meta-analysis including approximately 3,500 
subjects also reported that NAFLD based on ultrasonography is 
significantly associated with carotid intima-media thickness and 
carotid plaques.56 Presence of NAFLD is also independently as￾sociated in a dose-dependent manner with higher cardio-ankle 
vascular indices, a score which represents the stiffness of whole 
arterial segments from the aorta to the ankle that is closely 
associated with coronary atherosclerosis, cardiac function, hy￾pertension, stroke.57 Other case-control studies have also dem￾onstrated an association of NAFLD with increase arterial wall 
stiffness,58,59 altered endothelium-dependent flow-mediated va￾sodilation.29,60 Large cross-sectional studies have also established 
the association between ultrasonography-defined NAFLD and 
coronary artery calcification independent of classical coronary 
risk factors.61-63 These three studies include more than 20,000 
subjects and used computed tomography-based coronary artery 
calcium scores61,63 or coronary angiography64 to determine coro￾nary artery calcification. In a longitudinal study, NAFLD has 
also been shown to play an important role in the initial devel￾opment of coronary artery calcification without any at baseline 
calcification.65
In terms of CVD events, epidemiological associations point to 
an association between NAFLD and the risk of cardiovascular 
events. In a study of 17,350 subjects without known liver dis￾ease or significant alcohol consumption, ultrasonographically￾detected NAFLD was associated with an elevated 10-year risk 
of CVD as estimated using the Framingham risk score (FRS), 
independent of classical risk factors and other components of 
the metabolic syndrome.66 NAFLD had an odds ratio (OR) of 
1.35 (95% CI, 1.10 to 1.65) of higher 10-year risk of CVD with 
FRS >20 % in a multivariate model after for controlling for age, 
gender, BMI, waist circumference, and individual components

of the metabolic syndrome. A recent meta-analysis including a 
pooled population of 34,043 adults showed that NAFLD signifi￾cantly increased the risk of fatal and/or non-fatal CVD events 
during a median 6.9 years follow-up period, with a random ef￾fect OR of 1.64 (95% CI, 1.26 to 3.75).67 More severe NAFLD was 
also more likely to develop fatal and nonfatal CVD events (OR, 
2.58; 95% CI, 1.78 to 3.75).67 Regarding mortality, an analysis 
of the NHANES III in the United States, with a mean follow-up 
period of 15 years for NAFLD as defined by noninvasive scoring 
systems demonstrated increased mortality from CVD in sub￾jects with advanced fibrosis.7
 Indeed, another cohort study also 
supported the notion that more advanced fibrosis in NASH is 
associated with higher risk of CVD-related mortality and liver￾related disease.68 A multinational study of 458 patients with 
biopsy-confirmed NAFLD with bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis 
reported that patients with NAFLD cirrhosis have predominantly 
liver-related events, whereas those with bridging fibrosis have 
predominantly non-hepatic cancers and CVD events.69
Taken together, subjects with NAFLD are at high risk for CVD, 
including carotid and coronary atherosclerosis beyond what is 
explained by classical cardiovascular risk factors, visceral adi￾posity, and metabolic syndrome. Subjects with NAFLD should 
undergo careful cardiovascular surveillance. Moreover, those 
with the more severe forms of NAFLD need particular attention 
to ameliorate their high risk of CVD mortality.
CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE
Chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined as decreased esti￾mated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2
, 
abnormal albuminuria or overt proteinuria, is observed at high 
rates in subjects with NAFLD diagnosed by imaging or biopsy, 
ranging from approximately 20% to 50% in those with NAFLD 
compared to 5% to 25% in those without,25-27,70-79 which in most 
studies was independent of common risk factors for CKD such 
as hypertension, T2DM, and other renal risk factors. A meta￾analysis totaling nearly 64,000 subjects demonstrated that 
NAFLD, as diagnosed by either noninvasive scoring systems, 
imaging, or histology, was associated with an approximately 
2-fold increase in both prevalent (OR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.69 to 2.66) 
and incident CKD (HR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.65 to 1.95).80 There addi￾tionally appears to be a greater degree of renal impairment with 
histological severity of NASH.26 Indeed, a meta-analysis men￾tioned earlier demonstrated that NASH was associated with a 
higher prevalence (OR, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.58 to 4.05) and incidence 
(HR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.42 to 3.17) of CKD than NAFL.80 Addition￾ally, advanced fibrosis was associated with a higher prevalence 
(OR, 5.20; 95% CI, 3.14 to 8.61) and incidence (HR, 3.29; 95% 
CI, 2.30 to 4.71) of CKD than non-advanced fibrosis.80 More in￾triguingly, there is evidence that in patients with biopsy-proven 
NASH being treated with lifestyle modification over a year, 
improvement in NASH and histological findings were indepen￾dently associated with improvement in renal function.81 Emerg￾ing mechanistic links between NAFLD and CKD include altered 
regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, impaired anti￾oxidant defense mediated by nuclear factor erythroid 2-related 
factor-2, lipoprotein dysmetabolism, altered intestinal barrier 
integrity, and microbiome disturbances.82 Although the mecha￾nism of renal injury is postulated to be mediated primarily 
through atherogenesis, the absence of renal biopsies in studies 
examining NAFLD and CKD makes this an open question. These 
findings suggest that the strong association between NAFLD 
and CKD, including a relationship that appears to correspond 
with the severity of NAFLD, warrants clinical consideration in 
that improvement of NAFLD may also improve CKD, and that 
management of CKD and its sequelae should be incorporated in 
the care of patients with NAFLD.
HYPOTHYROIDISM
The thyroid gland plays an integral part in maintaining 
metabolic homeostasis, with effects on obesity, dyslipidemia, 
and therefore may be linked with NAFLD.83 Chung et al.
83 de￾termined that subclinical hypothyroidism was related to NAFLD 
in a dose-dependent manner. A cross-sectional study of 2,324 
cases with hypothyroidism with age- and sex-matched con￾trols demonstrated a higher prevalence of NAFLD with both 
increased thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and decreased 
free thyroxine (T4), including with subclinical hypothyroid￾ism and overt hypothyroidism.83 Multivariate analysis showed 
that subclinical and overt hypothyroidism are closely associ￾ated with NAFLD independent of the metabolic risk factors.83 A 
study using biopsy-proven NAFLD cohorts identified a higher 
prevalence (21% vs 9.5%) of hypothyroidism versus controls 
matched for age, sex, ethnicity, BMI, and metabolic syndrome 
components.84 A cross-sectional study of 425 subjects with 
biopsy-proven NAFLD determined that the prevalence of NASH 
and advanced fibrosis were significantly higher in subjects with 
low thyroid function (TSH ≥2.5 mIU/L) versus strict-normal (TSH, 
0.4 to 2.5 mIU/L) thyroid function (52.4% vs 37.2% for NASH, 
21.0% vs 10.6% for advanced fibrosis, p<0.01).85 Multivariate 
analyses showed that “low thyroid function” was significantly 
associated with NASH (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.04 to 2.50) and ad￾vanced fibrosis (OR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.18 to 4.23).85 The effects of 
plasma TSH within the euthyroid range on histological damage 
associated with NAFLD, found that low-normal thyroid function 
(TSH, 2.5 to 4.5) may also produce negative health effects simi￾lar to overt and subclinical hypothyroidism.85 Subclinical hypo￾thyroidism, even in the range of upper normal TSH levels, was 
correlated to NAFLD in a dose-dependent manner.85 This Asian 
study was confirmed by another study based on U.S. NHANES 
2007 to 2012. The prevalence of advanced fibrosis was signifi￾cantly higher in subjects with low-normal thyroid function and 
subclinical hypothyroidism than those with strict-normal thy-

roid function.86 In this study, multivariate analysis showed that 
“low-normal” thyroid function and subclinical hypothyroidism 
were significantly associated with a 1.9-fold increase (OR, 1.94; 
95% CI, 1.10 to 3.44) and 2.1-fold increase (OR, 2.05; 95% CI, 
1.01 to 4.16) in the risk for advanced fibrosis, respectively (p 
for trend=0.005).86 A recent study hypothesized that thyroid 
hormone receptor may activate hepatic stellate cells, suggest￾ing the potential role of thyroid hormone signaling in hepatic 
fibrogenesis.87 Currently, an orally administered, small-molecule 
liver-directed thyroid hormone receptor b agonist (MGL-3196) is 
under development for the treatment of NASH and hyperlipid￾emia.88,89 This hypothesis remains an area of open investigation, 
and further studies are warranted to elucidate the exact role of 
thyroid dysfunction in the progression to NASH and related ad￾vanced fibrosis.
POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME 
Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by hy￾perandrogenism, polycystic appearing ovaries, and oligomenor￾rhea or amenorrhea and occurs in 5% to 18% of women.90 The 
prevalence of NAFLD within the PCOS population is estimated 
to be 15% to 55% depending on the diagnostic criteria and 
population.91 Conversely, a small study of female patients at a 
liver clinic identified a prevalence of 71% for PCOS amongst 
reproductive-aged women with NAFLD, and those with PCOS 
had a high prevalence of NASH.92 Indeed, several meta-analyses 
have demonstrated that in women with PCOS, there is a higher 
risk of co-existing NAFLD compared to matched controls with 
estimates ranging from 2.2-fold to 3.9-fold, independent of fea￾tures of the metabolic syndrome.93-95 Like NAFLD, PCOS is as￾sociated with T2DM and insulin resistance, with approximately 
50% to 80% of women with PCOS exhibiting the latter.96 Insulin 
resistance may directly contribute to the pathogenesis of PCOS. 
Interestingly, multiple studies have now shown that women 
with PCOS and hepatic steatosis have increased levels of insulin 
resistance compared to women with PCOS without steatosis.97,98
In women with PCOS, elevated alanine aminotransferase levels 
were also associated with insulin resistance as measured by eu￾glycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp measures whereas it is similar 
to healthy controls in those with normal alanine aminotransfer￾ase.99 Similarly, approximately 60% of women with PCOS are 
also obese, and 50% have metabolic syndrome.91 However, a re￾cent study reported that women with PCOS had a higher preva￾lence of NAFLD than those without in nonobese population.100
Hyperandrogenism was a risk factor for nonobese NAFLD irre￾spective of age, obesity, lipid profile, insulin resistance or glyce￾mic status, suggesting an independent contribution of hyperan￾drogenism to NAFLD in nonobese women with PCOS.100 What 
is clear from the data is that there is are several common shared 
risk factors for both PCOS and NAFLD. Thus, careful evaluation 
for comorbid NAFLD and PCOS is warranted, especially in light 
of data suggesting higher rates of NASH in this population.92
PSORIASIS
Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease with an estimated 
prevalence of 2% to 3%101 and has been observed to have a 
higher prevalence in subjects with coexisting metabolic and/or 
obesity.101-103 NAFLD is also observed at a higher prevalence in 
subjects with psoriasis. One study of 129 subjects with psoriasis 
or psoriatic arthritis found that NAFLD occurs in approximately 
47% of subjects with psoriasis, and 22% of subjects with pso￾riasis also had biopsy-proven NASH.104 Other studies have simi￾larly observed this association and moreover demonstrated an 
adjusted OR of 1.7 for ultrasonographically-identified NAFLD 
in elderly subjects (age >55 years) with psoriasis as compared 
to those without, independent of alcohol consumption, smoking 
status, and presence of the metabolic syndrome.105 Interestingly, 
NAFLD was also associated with severity of psoriasis indepen￾dent of age, gender, BMI, duration of psoriasis, and alcohol 
consumption.106 Psoriasis-associated NAFLD was more likely 
to have higher estimated liver fibrosis based on noninvasive 
scoring systems.107 Whether psoriasis and NAFLD are caused by 
common underlying mechanisms, or if one affects the incidence 
of the other remains undefined. Notably, there exists evidence 
suggesting that patients with psoriasis, metabolic syndrome, 
and NAFLD treated with etanercept, a tumor necrosis factor α
inhibitor, as compared to those treated with psoralen–ultraviolet 
A had reductions in aspartate transaminase/alanine transami￾nase ratio, C-reactive protein serum levels, increased insulin 
sensitivity.108 Prospective studies are still needed to determine 
the impact of biologic treatments on NAFLD in psoriasis.109
TREATMENT
Currently, in the absence of approved effective pharmaco￾logic treatment for NAFLD, the treatment of choice for NAFLD 
is weight loss with lifestyle modification. The same treatment 
strategy may be applied for extrahepatic manifestations, with 
lifestyle modification being a key component of treatment 
strategy in the control of blood glucose, blood pressure, hyper￾lipidemia, cardiovascular disease, and other risk factors.110,111 In 
addition, clinicians should have a higher index of suspicion for 
common extrahepatic manifestations in patients with NAFLD. A 
proposed screening strategy for the more common extrahepatic 
has been proposed by VanWagner and Rinella,112 which in￾cludes monitoring hemoglobin A1c, fasting glucose, blood pres￾sure, lipid profile, urine microalbumin and albumin/creatinine 
ratio, estimated glomerular filtration rate, thyroid function tests, 
and ovarian ultrasound and/or serum androgens.
1. Weight loss
According to the American Association for the Study of Liver 

Li AA, et al: Extrahepatic Manifestations of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease 173
Disease practice guideline, loss of at least 3% to 5% of body 
weight may improve NAFLD, but a greater weight loss of up to 
10% may be necessary to improve the degree of hepatic necro￾inflammation.113 By the same token, sustained weight reduction 
by 5% to 7% may be sufficient to lower the risk of T2DM.114
Recent intervention trials have shown a remarkable reduction in 
the risk of T2DM (of 42% to 67%) with weight reduction com￾pared with control groups, even when the weight reduction was 
overall modest.114,115 Weight loss is associated with improvement 
in cellular insulin signal transduction, peripheral insulin sensi￾tivity, and insulin secretory responses.115 Patients with patatin￾like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3) 
NAFLD appear to be more sensitive to the beneficial effects 
of lifestyle modification on hepatic steatosis.116 Two European 
studies showed that weight loss decreases intrahepatic triglycer￾ide concentration117 and liver enzymes118 even more in subjects 
with homozygous GG than in those with homozygous CC. The 
pathophysiology of this finding is still unknown—the differ￾ences in insulin sensitivity between two alleles and the effect on 
abdominal obesity, which may modulate the effect of PNPLA3 
G allele on liver damage, may provide the explanations.117,118
2. Diet
Several dietary strategies have potentially positive effects on 
NAFLD, metabolic syndrome, and CVD. Reduction in the total 
calorie consumption is a crucial aspect of lifestyle modification, 
though at this time there is no consensus recommendation for 
dietary interventions to treat NAFLD, metabolic syndrome, and 
CVD. Daily caloric intake varies according to ethnicity, sex, BMI, 
and comorbidities. To achieve the optimal caloric reduction, 
estimation of individual energy requirements and prescription 
of an energy deficit of 500 kcal/day or 30% of baseline is gen￾erally recommended.119 In addition to the reduction of the total 
caloric intake, a change in the composition of the diet may be 
important in the treatment of NAFLD and comorbid metabolic 
syndrome and/or CVD. Subjects with NAFLD tend to consume 
more soft drinks and meat, and less fish rich in omega-3 fatty 
acids.120 Recent systematic reviews have reported that restric￾tion of dietary carbohydrate (e.g., simple carbohydrate and high 
glycemic carbohydrate) and fat (e.g., total and saturated fat) can 
lower the liver enzymes and/or reduce the grade of steatosis in 
subjects with NAFLD.121 To the extent that high fructose is asso￾ciated with NAFLD and advanced histology,122 limiting fructose 
consumption may be beneficial. 
3. Physical activity
Increased physical activity is thought to have a beneficial ef￾fect on NAFLD and comorbid conditions including metabolic 
syndrome and CVD by reducing visceral fat. Several studies 
have suggested that a reduction in hepatic fat was secondary to 
a reduction in visceral fat. Thus, the relationship between hepat￾ic fat content and physical activity disappears when accounting 
for intra-abdominal obesity,123-125 although conflicting data ex￾ist.126-128 In a large cross-sectional study, an inverse association 
between total and leisure-time physical activities and the preva￾lence of NAFLD was observed, independent of visceral adiposity 
and insulin resistance.129 A recent prospective cohort study from 
our group demonstrated a lower risk of incident NAFLD in 4 
years of follow-up based on physical activity level at baseline.130
Furthermore, sustained or increased physical activity had a pre￾ventive effect on incident NAFLD, independent of visceral adi￾posity and insulin resistance.130 In summary, increased physical 
activity is an important component of lifestyle modification in 
patients with NAFLD and comorbid extrahepatic manifestations, 
irrespective of visceral obesity or insulin resistance. However, 
there is no consensus regarding the most effective exercise regi￾men, such as duration and type of activities.
CONCLUSION
Based on current evidence, the clinical burden of NAFLD 
extends well beyond liver-related morbidity and mortality. 
NAFLD can be associated with extrahepatic complications in￾cluding CVD, CKD, T2DM, hypothyroidism, PCOS, psoriasis, and 
metabolic syndrome. Though the majority of evidence to date is 
observational and retrospective, these associations have impor￾tant clinical significance in screening, risk factor modification, 
and potential therapeutics. For example, weight loss, smoking 
cessation, and dietary changes have the potential to affect the 
progression of NAFLD and its extrahepatic comorbid complica￾tions, but future studies will be needed to better understand the 
pathophysiology and to potentially alter the natural history of 
these conditions.
