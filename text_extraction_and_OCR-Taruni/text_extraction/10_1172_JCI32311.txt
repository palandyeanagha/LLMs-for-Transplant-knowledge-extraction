Small airway fibrosis (bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome) is the primary obstacle to long-term survival fol￾lowing lung transplantation. Here, we show the importance of functional microvasculature in the prevention
of epithelial loss and fibrosis due to rejection and for the first time, relate allograft microvascular injury and
loss oftissue perfusion to immunotherapy-resistant rejection. To explore the role of alloimmune rejection and
airway ischemia in the development of fibroproliferation, we used a murine orthotopic tracheal transplant
model. We determined that transplants were reperfused by connection of recipient vessels to donor vessels
at the surgical anastomosis site. Microcirculation through the newly formed vascular anastomoses appeared
partially dependent onVEGFR2 andCXCR2 pathways.In the absence ofimmunosuppression,the microvascu￾lature in rejecting allografts exhibited vascular complement deposition, diminished endothelial CD31 expres￾sion, and absent perfusion prior to the onset offibroproliferation. Rejecting grafts with extensive endothelial
cell injury were refractory to immunotherapy. After early microvascular loss, neovascularization was eventu￾ally observed in the membranous trachea, indicating a reestablishment of graft perfusion in established fibro￾sis. One implication ofthis study is that bronchial artery revascularization at the time oflung transplantation
may decrease the risk of subsequent airway fibrosis.
Introduction
The major obstacle to survival following lung transplantation is 
the bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) (1), which is clinically 
defined by a decline in ventilatory function and histologically 
characterized by fibro-obliteration of small airways (2). Despite 
identification of risk factors for the development of BOS such as 
rejection and CMV infection, the etiology of the fibroproliferative 
changes associated with BOS remains unknown (3). Recent autop￾sy studies from Luckraz and colleagues demonstrate a marked 
loss of microvasculature in nonoccluded small airways from BOS 
lungs, suggesting airway ischemia as a preceding condition to 
airway fibrosis (4, 5). Accordingly, some have hypothesized that 
chronic airway ischemia and hypoxia could contribute to airway 
fibro-obliteration following lung transplantation (6–8).
To explore the role of alloimmune rejection and airway ischemia in 
the development of fibroproliferation, we used a murine orthotopic 
tracheal transplant (OTT) model. Allogeneic OTTs have previously 
been used as a model of lymphocytic bronchitis, the large airway 
correlate of BOS, developing both epithelial metaplasia and subepi￾thelial fibrosis (9). In the present study, we delineate the interactions 
of host and recipient blood vessels after OTT and demonstrate that 
the resultant time-dependent loss of vascular perfusion in allografts 
corresponds to the presence of tissue hypoxia. Critical time points of 
rejection were then studied in a clinically relevant model to demon￾strate the importance of functional microvasculature in the preven￾tion of epithelial loss and fibrosis due to rejection.
Results
Acute rejection of orthotopic tracheal allografts leads to loss of donor-type epi￾thelium, loss of submucosal vessels, and fibrosis by day 28. We first sought 
to determine histologic differences between untreated allografts 
and syngeneic grafts (syngrafts; Figure 1). Syngrafts have normal 
architecture on day 6 following transplantation. Allografts at the 
same time point demonstrate inflammatory cell infiltrates of the 
submucosa and epithelium composed of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, 
neutrophils, and macrophages (our unpublished observations). 
Twenty-eight days following transplantation, untreated allografts 
developed subepithelial fibrosis and loss of columnar epithelium. 
To explore changes in epithelial morphology and donor-recipient 
interactions, we used coronally sectioned tracheal specimens that 
included both the allograft and the recipient tracheal ends en bloc. 
Allograft epithelium at day 8 in the graft was still donor derived 
as demonstrated by H-2Kd staining. Day 12 allograft coronal sec￾tions illustrated epithelial replacement by flattened cells follow￾ing graft-specific sloughing of columnar epithelium at day 10 
(data not shown). There was a loss of endothelial cell staining in 
allografts between day 10 and day 12. Simultaneous loss of CD31+

structures and of epithelia (an event tightly linked to fibrosis) sug￾gested that the 2 events were related and further study of perfusion 
status of the vessels was therefore warranted.
Tracheal microvasculature is highly organized based on cartilaginous 
anatomy. The trachea consists of cartilage C-rings, which are sepa￾rated axially as well as in the opening of the C by membranous 
trachea. Tissue histology was evaluated after ventral division and 
then flattening of the tracheal tube under a coverslip as a whole 
mount. Figure 2 shows angiograms of the same naive trachea by 
2 different techniques, FITC-tagged lectin vascular perfusion in 
vivo and tracheal whole-mount CD31 immunostaining ex vivo. 
Though CD31 can also be expressed by lymphatic endothelium, 
use of the lymphatic specific marker LYVE-1 demonstrated that 
the majority of CD31+ structures in this model were not lymphat￾ics (our unpublished observations).
Allogeneic and syngeneic grafts were perfused by day 6 following transplan￾tation. To determine how and when these grafts were perfused with 
blood, allografts and syngrafts were harvested on days 2, 4, and 6 fol￾lowing implantation (Figure 3). Prior to sacrifice, animals received 
intravenously administered FITC-conjugated tomato lectin to bind 
and identify perfused blood vessels. Excised tracheae were also 
stained as whole tissues for CD31 to identify blood vessels regard￾less of their perfusion status. At day 2, both syngrafts and allografts 
had a complete lack of perfusion, though there was a vascular net￾work identified by CD31 staining. Perfusion in both allografts and 
syngrafts was first evident on day 4 and was complete by day 6. This 
relatively expeditious and complete perfusion of the grafts led us to 
query whether the donor vessel network was retained and became 
continuous with the recipient animal’s vessels.
Allografts and syngrafts reperfuse by connections between recipient and 
donor blood vessels at the level of the anastomosis. To assess whether 
graft reperfusion occurs by neovascularization of the graft or by 
reperfusion of the donor vascular network via connections with 
recipient vessels, we used FVB strain transgenic mice expressing

β-galactosidase on the endothelial cell–specific Tie2 promoter. 
Allografts (BALB/c→FVB [Tie2/β-galactosidase]) and syngrafts 
(FVB [WT]→FVB [Tie2/β-galactosidase]) were sacrificed at day 
6, and animals were perfused with red-colored India ink via the 
aorta. Specimens were evaluated as whole mounts (Figure 3D). In 
both allografts and syngrafts, graft vessels were only red in color 
— proving that they were perfused but not composed of recipient 
endothelial cells. Vessels in the recipient ends were blue in color, 
consistent with their recipient origin. Further magnification at 
the anastomosis revealed that multiple small blue (recipient) ves￾sels connect to red (donor) vessels at the anastomosis. Uniquely in 
the allografts, these vessels are chimeric, composed of MHC-mis￾matched endothelium.
Infiltration of recipient-derived CD31–/Tie2+ cells into graft occurs at 6 
day. Many cells expressing β-galactosidase (and hence Tie2) but not 
a component of perfused vessels were observed in the allograft at 
day 6 (Figure 3E). These cells appeared to be interspersed among 
the CD31+ vessels but did not make up part of the vessel wall or 
express CD31 antigen. To confirm that CD31 staining was not 
obscured by β-galactosidase staining, we stained serial sections 
with CD31 alone and found that the nonvascular Tie2-expressing 
cells in fact did not express CD31.
Untreated allografts lose perfusion by day 10. As shown above, CD31 
staining of axial sections was diminished on day 10 and disappeared 
by day 12. To further study this finding, vascular perfusion experi￾ments were performed in 3 groups of animals: syngrafts, untreated 
allografts, and treated allografts (anti–LFA-1 + anti–CD40 ligand 
[anti-CD40L] at days 8, 10, and 12. Syngrafts were perfused at all 
3 time points (Figure 4), whereas allografts had complete loss of 
perfusion throughout the graft at both day 10 and day 12. Animals 
treated with immunosuppression were comparable to those receiv￾ing syngrafts, implicating the unchecked alloimmune response in 
the loss of perfusion. Use of mean fluorescent intensity and per￾centage area of vessels per 20× field on all specimens confirmed 
visual findings. There was also a loss of CD31 immunoreactiv￾ity, with only small segments of CD31+ vessels remaining in the

grafts at day 10 and no segments by day 12 (A.N. Babu, unpub￾lished observations). Given that complement activation has been 
associated with early allograft vascular injury, we queried whether 
complement-mediated mechanisms could be involved.
C3 deposition is apparent in vascular endothelium of allografts but not 
syngrafts. Immunofluorescence staining for C3 demonstrated C3 
positivity in the subepithelium of allografts, with no staining in 
syngeneic grafts (Figure 5). Double staining for C3 and CD31 
demonstrated colocalization of C3 with CD31+ vessels, suggesting 
complement-mediated endothelial injury as one mechanism for 
vascular destruction.
VEGFR2 and CXC chemokine receptor 2 antagonism do not prevent 
early angiogenesis but accelerate perfusion loss. To determine what pro￾angiogenic signaling molecules were important in the early revas￾cularization of the tracheal allografts, we used pharmaceuticals to 
antagonize both VEGFR2 and CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) 
signaling independently. Surprisingly, neither strategy affected the 
early revascularization, and complete revascularization was evident 
by day 6 in both treatment groups. However, rather than a perfusion 
loss at day 10, animals treated with VEGFR2 or CXCR2 antagonists 
had early loss of perfusion, occurring by day 8 (Figure 6).
Untreated allografts develop progressive tissue hypoxia by day 10. Rapid 
loss of blood supply prior to epithelial sloughing and fibrosis led us 
to question whether detectable tissue hypoxia was also occurring. 
To determine whether the loss of perfusion in allografts had a phys￾iologic effect, epithelial tissue oxygen content was measured in the 
graft in both syngrafts and allografts. Allografts had progressively 
decreasing tissue partial pressure of O2 (pO2) from day 4 (25.7 ± 1.2

mmHg) to day 6 (17.2 ± 0.5 mmHg) to day 10 (13.3 ± 1.8 mmHg), 
whereas syngrafts maintained tissue oxygen contents in the range 
of 32.7 to 36.8 mmHg (Figure 7A).
Only allografts with normal perfusion and endothelium can be rescued 
by immunosuppression. To determine whether the previously dem￾onstrated perfusion defects had any relevance to the important 
end point of successful treatment of acute rejection, we employed 
a delayed immunotherapy model. Allografts (BALB/c→C57BL/6J 
[BALB/c→B6]) underwent rejection for varying durations (6–14 
days); the graft was then removed and retransplanted into naive 
B6 animals receiving potent immunosuppression with anti–LFA-1 
plus anti-CD40L for 28 days, at which time they were sacrificed. 
We measured the level of airway remodeling using a previously 
validated (9) ratio of subepithelial height to epithelial height (Fig￾ure 7B). Airways undergoing 6 days of alloimmune injury could be 
rescued to normal airway architecture. However, tracheae undergo￾ing 10 days or more of alloimmune injury progressed to fibrotic 
airway remodeling following delayed immunotherapy. On day 6, 
allografts had massive inflammatory cell infiltrate but normal￾appearing vascular endothelium according to EM, but appearance 
was normal after retransplant accompanied by immunosuppres￾sion. Day 10 allografts were similarly inflamed; however, the endo￾thelium was markedly abnormal, with thinning of the endothelial 
barrier, pyknotic nuclei, and red blood cell extravasation visible by 
EM. Airways with injured endothelium progressed to airway remod￾eling with subepithelial fibrosis and epithelial flattening regardless 
of attempted immunotherapy rescue. To determine changes at the 
transcriptome level during the period of vascular destruction, day 
6 and day 10 allografts were evaluated by gene microarray (Table 1). 
Expression of several genes known to be induced by hypoxia and/or 
ischemia were increased at day 10 versus day 6.
An additional transection of vessels during retransplantation leads to inef￾fective revascularization and subsequent fibrosis. To further demonstrate 
that the vascular supply was critical to the maintenance of normal 
airway architecture, the retransplantation studies were again per￾formed following 6 days of alloimmune injury with an additional 
surgical transection of vessels during retransplantation as illustrat￾ed in Figure 8. As described in Figure 7, the BALB/c→B6 allograft 
was cut at its anastomosis, and the BALB/c trachea was trans￾planted to a naive B6 recipient receiving combined anti–LFA-1/
anti-CD40L therapy. At 10 days following retransplant, normal 
perfusion to the graft was demonstrated using this technique, and 
as shown in Figure 7, after 28 days histology exhibited a restora￾tion of normal airway architecture. However, by adding a second 
transection point on both sides of the allograft in the first recipi￾ent, as demonstrated in Figure 8D, perfusion at 10 day was lost in 
the second immunosuppressed host, and by 28 days the graft had 
progressed to epithelial flattening and subepithelial fibrosis.
Recipient-derived endothelium contributes to partial revascularization of 
allograft airway by day 28. Considering the complete loss of perfusion

at 10 days, we assessed the 28 day time point in BALB/c→C57BL/6 
allografts for neovascularization. We did find selective angiogenesis 
in the central membranous portion of the trachea as well as the inter￾cartilaginous membranous areas in all 4 animals examined (Figure 9). 
Once again using the FVB (Tie2/β-galactosidase) animals as allogeneic 
recipients, these vessels were noted to partially revascularize the mem￾branous trachea and were partially composed of recipient-derived 
endothelium by 28 days as demonstrated by the black arrows. Inter￾estingly, in 5 of 8 specimens at 28 days, there was columnar epithe￾lium overlying only the membranous portion of the trachea following 
28 days of rejection, again suggesting a relationship between regional 
blood flow and normally differentiated columnar epithelium.

lectin perfusion staining. Interestingly, these therapies had no effect on the revascularization occurring by 6 day. However, the loss of perfusion 
occurred by day 8 rather than by day 10 as in untreated allografts.

Discussion
Fibrosis-related organ dysfunction following inflammation lim￾its the success of all organ allografts. Data from this study suggest 
that a functional microvasculature is critical in the maintenance of 
normal airway architecture and may be a critical mechanistic link 
between inflammation and therapy-resistant rejection leading to 
fibrosis. Loss of CD31+ endothelium after 10 days of airway rejection 
is synchronous with columnar epithelial sloughing and dysplastic 
columnar epithelial replacement, a finding that has already been cor￾related to alloimmune airway fibrosis (9). Following complete revas￾cularization of syngrafts and allografts by 6 days via connection of 
recipient vessels to preexisting donor vessels in the graft, allografts 
exhibit complement deposition and undergo immunologically 
mediated vessel destruction. Loss of functional microvasculature is 
coincident with the onset of tissue hypoxia and the activation of a 
hypoxia-induced gene program. The overall relevance of these find￾ings is substantiated by the fact that rejected airways, which still have 
functional microvasculature, can be rescued by immunotherapy; 
whereas those with damaged vessels invariably progress to airway 
remodeling with fibrosis. Additionally, preventing normal revascu￾larization of a rescuable rejected allograft by surgical vessel transec￾tion led to fibrosis. This is the first study to our knowledge to link 
the loss of allograft functional microcirculation to the troublesome 
clinical entity of immunosuppression-resistant allograft fibrosis.
The use of OTT as a model for alloimmune airway rejection is 
well established (9, 10); airway remodeling is manifested by subepi￾Figure 7
Injured and nonperfused endothelium is a marker for injury severity that cannot be rescued by immunosuppression. (A) Tissue oximetry was 
performed using a microprobe to detect tracheal epithelial pO2. Syngrafts maintain consistent tissue oxygen content, whereas allografts develop 
relative tissue hypoxia by 10 day. (B) Allografts (BALB/c→B6) were allowed to undergo varying durations of rejection, at which point they were 
retransplanted to naive immunosuppressed B6 animals for an additional 28 days. H&E-stained axial sections were used to measure the ratio 
of subepithelial height to epithelial height. This measure has been validated previously as correlating strongly with chronic rejection histologic 
scoring (9). Syngeneic grafts that were retransplanted maintained a normal ratio of approximately 1. Rejection durations of 10 day or longer 
resulted in severe airway remodeling despite rescue therapy (n = 5/group). *P < 0.05 versus all other groups. (C) Axial section of allograft fol￾lowing 6 days rejection. (D) EM demonstrating normal appearance of vascular endothelium in an allograft following 6 days rejection. (E) Axial

thelial fibrosis as a result of chronic injury, as occurs in the large 
airways following human lung transplantation (11). The OTT 
model is not an obstructive airway disease model but rather repro￾duces the fibrosis that follows lymphocytic bronchitis. Therefore, 
the OTT model allows only inferences about the fibrotic process 
that takes place in terminal bronchioles. The great advantage 
of this system, however, is that the microvasculature is densely 
arrayed in a single tissue plane, allowing relatively easy quanti￾tation and description. This is much less readily studied in lung 
parenchyma or terminal bronchioles, where the anatomy is not so 
concentrated in a defined area.
The findings of the current model system appear consonant 
with the observation of small vessel loss prior to the development 
of BOS and small vessel return (in a limited fashion) in established 
BOS as noted in lung transplant autopsy studies by Luckraz and 
colleagues (4, 5). These findings may indicate that when inflam￾mation is coupled to relative tissue hypoxemia, immunotherapy￾refractory fibroproliferation is more likely to occur than if the 
tissue is adequately oxygenated. This idea could explain why ter￾minal bronchioles (which are ordinarily partially supplied by the 
bronchial artery circulation; ref. 12) may be especially vulnerable 
to fibrosis in a lung transplant (which has no bronchial artery 
circulation) compared with other airway inflammatory disorders 
where the bronchial artery circulation is preserved. It is important 
to note that with the microvascular changes observed in the Luck￾raz study (5), even as the vessel count drops and eventually rises, 
the increased vascularity only involves the relatively low O2 tension 
of the pulmonary artery circulation.
A recent study by Belperio and colleagues (13) also emphasized 
the importance of the microvasculature in lung transplantation–

Additional transection of blood vessels during retransplantation affects 
perfusion and leads to fibrosis. As shown in Figure 7B, BALB/c→B6 
allografts having undergone 6 days of rejection can be rescued from 
fibrosis by retransplantation into a naive B6 immunosuppressed hosts.

graft from the original recipient at the original anastomosis site and 
retransplanting it. (B) Ten days following retransplant into naive immu￾nosuppressed host, there is normal perfusion throughout the graft. (C) 
By 28 days, histology is normal with no fibrosis and well-differentiated 
epithelium. (D) To determine whether manipulating the blood flow to 
a rescuable airway could affect end outcome, we divided the day 6

related fibrosis, and is seemingly at odds with our findings as it 
underscores the potentially deleterious effects of angiogenesis on 
the development of fibrosis. However, this apparent discrepancy 
may largely reflect differences in the time points evaluated in each 
study; microvascular dropout may not have been observed in the 
former study because it occurred during a noninvestigated time 
period. The current study demonstrates that angiogenesis occurs 
early following transplantation, resulting in a hookup of donor 
and recipient vessels. In keeping with the Luckraz study of clinical 
lung transplant lungs (5), there is a drop-off in the microvascula￾ture after the connection is lost (analogous to pre-BOS lungs), and 
then finally there is new angiogenesis after fibrosis is established. 
Specifically, the current model demonstrates active angiogenesis 
(on days 4, 6, 8, and 28) near the time period that the Belperio 
study demonstrated new angiogenesis (on days 7 and 21). By dis￾tinction, the current study also shows a loss of vessels on day 10, 
which is a time point not examined previously. Indeed, most lit￾erature in lung transplantation has reported increased microvas￾culature in chronic lung transplant rejection (4, 5, 14). The current 
study demonstrates that there is a notable period of time when vas￾cular dropout occurs prior to renewed angiogenesis in established 
fibrosis. While microvasculature destruction has been described 
in other forms of chronic allograft destruction, it has not been 
thoroughly examined in lung transplantation, which is likely the 
graft most burdened by the negative effects of fibrosis. While this 
concept has been studied to some extent in skin transplantation 
(15), no published report has examined the therapeutic “point of 
no return” in relationship to the loss of circulation.
Another important question is in regard to the signaling mole￾cules that cause angiogenesis and vascular hookup at day 6. VEGF 
signaling via VEGFR2 is well known to be an important pathway 
in endothelial cell proliferation and vessel formation (16). VEGF 
has also been implicated in TH2-mediated sensitization, inflam￾mation, and lung parenchymal fibrosis (17). CXC chemokines via 
their receptor CXCR2 are also known to contribute to angiogene￾sis in many situations, while CXCR2 antagonism can be protective 
against experimental fibrosis (13). To determine which pathways 
were functional in this model, we used drugs to block both path￾ways. Surprisingly, we did not find any change in the neovascular￾ization occurring by day 6 in treated animals. However, there was 
an early loss of perfusion at 8 days in rejecting allografts, suggest￾ing that the neovessels have both VEGFR2 and CXCR2 dependency 
for their patency. It is possible that these pathways are important 
for neovascularization as well, but the systemically administered 
drugs were not perfused to the graft early after transplant. The 
cumulative findings of this and prior studies are consistent with 
the seemingly paradoxical notion that increased vascularity to an 
inflamed airway (influenced in part by accumulating lymphocytes; 
ref. 18) may be both harmful and protective; angiogenesis may be 
harmful by facilitating the entrance of leukocytes into the graft 
but also (at least temporarily) protective in preserving both the 
nutrient and oxygen supply to a relatively hypoxic area.
A proof-of-principle experiment demonstrating that early vascu￾larity of the allograft is protective is difficult to design because of 
the overlap between proangiogenic and proimmunogenic factors. 
Most agents used to address angiogenesis also have immunomod￾ulatory properties. It was therefore necessary to devise a strategy 
that minimally impacted the immune response of the host or the 
immunogenicity of the transplant because alteration of either one 
of these properties would affect the interpretation of results. Due 
to the difficulty encountered in attempting to induce angiogenesis 
without immunomodulation, we were forced to explore the con￾verse: that is, we sought to determine whether providing an addi￾tional nonimmunomodulatory obstacle to graft revascularization 
could prevent rescue from fibrosis. To do this, we allowed allografts 
to undergo 6 days of injury prior to rescue in an immunosup￾pressed host with or without transections at a secondary site. We 
reasoned that these new secondary transections provided an addi￾tional nonimmunogenic disruption to vessels and could therefore 
lead to fibroproliferation in the second immunosuppressed recipi￾ent in a manner similar to animals that had undergone 10 days of 
injury. Those grafts that were retransplanted with additional vessel 
transections were unable to be rescued. While it was assumed that 
the vascular anastomosis in the first transplant was more tenuous 
than the native circulation, this was not, in fact, known. Rather, the 
outcome itself became clear; this second transection resulted in a 
loss of perfusion to the graft in the second transplant, and this loss 
of perfusion was again ultimately associated with fibrosis. These 
data provide additional correlative evidence as to the importance 
of blood flow in preserving normal graft architecture.

Neovascularization of membranous trachea by day 28 involves recipi￾ent-derived endothelium and supports a well-differentiated epithelium. 
(A) Neovascularization is evident by perfusion lectin staining in the 
membranous and intercartilaginous portions of the trachea following 
28 days of rejection (n = 4). The dashed line indicates the anastomosis 
site separating the recipient and donor. (B) Use of FVB (Tie2/β-galac￾tosidase) recipients (n = 3) demonstrated that by day 28, new vessels 
were composed partially of recipient-derived endothelium (large black 
arrows), and β-galactosidase expressing cells (small yellow arrow) 
appeared to still be present in the allograft in the proximity of vessels. 
(C) Five of 8 specimens studied demonstrate columnar epithelium only 
overlying the membranous portion of the trachea following 28 days 
of rejection, suggesting that the blood supply in this region may be 
required to support this epithelial phenotype. Original magnification,

We defined the time course and mechanism of graft reperfusion 
in the OTT model using fluorescence perfusion techniques as well 
as transgenic mice with marked vascular endothelial cells. Reperfu￾sion appeared to occur in an all-or-none pattern consistent with the 
mechanism of donor vascular network reconnection to recipient 
vessels. Though this has not been previously studied in orthotopic 
tracheal grafts, other studies have demonstrated similar mechan￾ics of revascularization as well as time course in avascular grafts 
such as skin autografts (19, 20) and peripheral nerve allografts (21). 
Interestingly, the transgenic Tie2/β-galactosidase recipients had 
many cells in the allograft expressing β-galactosidase. However, 
none of these cells were physically located within blood vessels, nor 
did they express CD31 antigen. In light of the data demonstrat￾ing recipient-derived endothelium contributing to vessels at day 
28, these cells may be immature endothelial progenitor cells that 
express Tie2 but not CD31 (22). Conversely, these cells may be the 
result of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition and could contrib￾ute to graft fibrosis (23). Further study is required to completely 
characterize the phenotype and function of these cells.
The reperfusing chimeric vessels in allografts were destroyed by 
10 days following transplantation. Immunologically mediated 
microvascular destruction in liver allograft bile ducts has been 
reported to precede the loss of bile ducts, which is characteristic of 
chronic hepatic rejection (24). Similarly, in renal allografts, severe 
rejection is characterized by loss of peritubular capillaries, a critical 
step in graft dysfunction (25). Also, as described above, pre-BOS 
airways have been demonstrated to have a dearth of microvascula￾ture. Understanding the mechanisms by which allogeneic vessels 
are injured and not repaired will be critical to designing therapeu￾tic strategies. Vascular endothelial cells present antigen to T lym￾phocytes, which can induce endothelial cell injury via apoptosis 
induction (26, 27). Additionally, C3 deposition in tracheal vessels 
at day 6 in the OTT model suggests a role for complement in the 
vascular injury observed in this model.
Mucosal inflammation in the gut is known to be accompanied 
by hypoxia and a resulting proangiogenic response (28). Similarly, 
a proangiogenic mediator profile was also apparent in this model, 
though immunologic attack of graft vasculature may have pre￾vented an effective response to these mediators. Tissue hypoxia 
in allografts, as a result of inflammation and vascular destruc￾tion, was confirmed by measurement of tissue pO2. Interestingly, 
allografts at both day 6 and day 10 had relatively low oxygen con￾tent. This finding is disparate with the perfusion data showing 
normal perfusion at day 6 in allografts. However, the presumably 
high metabolic requirements of the inflammatory cells at day 6 
could result in an oxygen supply/demand mismatch, leading to 
hypoxia even with an intact circulation (28).
Lung transplants are the only solid organ allografts that do not 
routinely undergo direct systemic arterial reconnection at the time 
of surgery. One implication of this study is that the absence of the 
systemic arterial circulation predisposes lung transplant recipients 
to airway fibrosis. While there is no conclusive evidence currently 
demonstrating that the lack of a bronchial artery circulation is 
meaningfully deleterious in lung transplantation, the preponder￾ance of literature indicates that revascularization would likely be 
a helpful adjunctive maneuver. Preclinical and preliminary clini￾cal studies demonstrate that bronchial artery revascularization 
improves tissue perfusion with more highly oxygenated blood 
(8, 29); is durable (30), associated with less epithelial metaplasia 
(31), and protective of pulmonary endothelium and type II pneu￾mocytes (32); and may postpone the development of BOS while 
improving patient survival (33). How hypoxia and ischemia may 
incite fibrosis is not established. In vitro studies have demon￾strated profibrotic phenotypic change of fibroblasts in response 
to hypoxia (34–36). Epithelial and endothelial cells can undergo 
mesenchymal transition under ischemia to become another source 
of activated fibroblasts (37). In summary, although conclusive 
evidence is lacking, the preponderance of evidence is that revas￾cularization could have a beneficial effect on the success of the 
transplant. The current study may therefore provide an additional 
rationale for reconsidering the routine application of this revascu￾larization procedure at the time of lung transplantation.
Methods
Tracheal transplantation. All animal studies were approved by the University 
of Colorado Health Sciences Center Institutional Animal Care and Utiliza￾tion Committee. B6 (H-2b) mice were transplanted with tracheae from B6 
and MHC-mismatched BALB/c (H-2d) mice (Jackson Laboratory). Seven￾ring tracheal segments were removed from CO2-euthanized donor mice 
that were matched for recipient age and male sex. Recipient mice were anes￾thetized with ketamine 50 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine, and a 
short incision was made in the midline neck region. Division of the strap 
muscles allowed visualization of the entire laryngotracheal complex. After 
the recipient’s trachea was transected, the donor trachea was sewn in with 
10-0 nylon sutures, and the overlying skin was closed with 5-0 silk.
Immunosuppression and drug therapy. The immunotherapy protocol was 
identical to a previously published study using combined anti–LFA-1/
anti-CD40L therapy (38). Animals received the following protocol: anti–
LFA-1 (KBA), 200 μg i.p. on days 0, 1, 7, and 14 (day 0 being the day of 
transplantation), and anti-CD40L (MR-1), 250 μg i.p. on day –1 and twice 
per week thereafter. VEGFR2 antagonist SU5416 from SUGEN was dis￾solved in CMC (carboxymethylcellulose) and administered at 20 mg/kg 
subcutaneously every other day for the study period. A hexapeptide CXCR2 
antagonist known as antileukinate was dissolved in Hanks buffered saline 
solution to a concentration of 8 mg/ml and administered using an Alzet 
microosmotic pump implanted subcutaneously on the day of transplant at 
a rate of 0.25 μl per hour, delivering 2 μg of drug per hour (39).
Histology. For axial sections, tracheae were sagittally divided, with one￾half being formalin fixed (H&E; trichrome) and one-half frozen for 
immunohistochemistry. Paraffin-embedded tracheal segments were initially 
fixed in cold 10% neutral-buffered formalin solution, and 5-μm sections were 
cut and stained for H&E and Masson’s trichrome. For immunohistochemistry 
studies, 5-μm frozen sections were used. Endothelial cells were identified by 
CD31 immunoreactivity using rat anti-mouse CD31 (BD Biosciences). For 
class I MHC staining, mouse anti-mouse H-2Kd (BD Biosciences) was used. 
An Olympus BX51 microscope with Image-Pro Plus Image Analysis Software 
(Media Cybernetics) and camera were used for histological and morphomet￾ric analysis. Double staining for β-galactosidase and CD31 involved the stan￾dard β-galactosidase as used below for whole mounts followed by the CD31 
immunostaining technique followed above. C3 staining was conducted on 
frozen sections using either FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse C3 antibody 
or goat anti-mouse C3 primary antibody (MP Biomedicals) and a Cy3 rabbit 
anti-goat secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.).
Whole-mount tissue fixation, harvest, and staining. Whole-mount tracheae were 
evaluated for vascular perfusion and CD31 immunoreactivity by fluorescence 
staining techniques as described previously by Baffert et al. (40). Detailed 
methods were provided by Donald McDonald (UCSF, San Francisco, 
California, USA). Under anesthesia, 100 μl of 1 mg/ml FITC-conjugated 
Lycopersicon esculentum tomato lectin (Vector Laboratories) was injected 
into the inferior vena cava over 1 minute. After 3 minutes of circulation,

sternotomy was performed followed by right atriotomy and cannulation 
of the aorta via left ventricle with an 18 gauge angiocatheter. PBS with 1% 
paraformaldehyde was perfused via the aorta for 2 minutes at 120 mmHg. 
Orthotopic tracheal graft along with adjoining recipient trachea was dis￾sected free of surrounding tissues. The trachea was pinned and incubated in 
1% paraformaldehyde. Following a PBS wash, the trachea was bathed in 5% 
donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.) and in PBS+ 
(PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.2% albumin). Blocking serum was 
poured off, and PBS+ containing rat anti–PECAM-1 (CD31) (BD Biosci￾ences) and 1% donkey serum was added and incubated. Tracheae were then 
washed in PBS+ and in Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rat secondary antibody 
(Jackson Immunoresearch) in PBS+ with no serum and incubated. Whole 
tracheae were placed on glass slides in Vectashield H1000 anti-quench 
mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and a coverslip placed.
Confocal microscopy. Images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM510 laser scan￾ning confocal microscope located in the Light Microscopy Core Facility at 
the University of Colorado. A software configuration was established to 
simultaneously capture emission wavelengths from the FITC-conjugated 
lectin and the Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody used to detect CD31 
antigen. Images were captured using a Zeiss 20× Plan-Apochromat objective 
with a numerical aperture of 0.8 and a working distance of 0.55 mm. The 
x-y resolution was 0.45 μm and the z-stacks were acquired at 2-μm intervals. 
The pinholes for the PMT detectors were optimized to 1 airy disk.
β-Galactosidase vessel origin study. To identify recipient blood vessels, we 
used FVB/N-Tg (Tie2-lacZ)182Sato/J mice (Jackson Laboratory), which 
carry reporter gene β-galactosidase under control of the Tie2 (a promoter 
that identifies vascular endothelium). They were transplanted with trache￾ae from MHC-matched FVB and MHC-mismatched BALB/c donors. Allo￾geneic and syngeneic grafts were harvested as whole mounts as described 
above following 1% PFA in PBS vascular fixation. They were then soaked 
in 1% PFA in PBS at 4°C for 60 minutes. β-Galactosidase expressing ves￾sels were stained blue using X-Gal Staining kit (Millipore; Chemicon) per 
the manufacturer’s protocol. After rinsing in PBS, tracheae were placed on 
glass slides with aqueous mounting medium Aqua-Mount (Fisher Scien￾tific) and then compressed with coverslips and 5 ounces lead weight and 
allowed to dry. As above, Olympus BX51 microscope and camera were used 
to acquire photomicrographs.
Tissue oximetry. Tissue oxygen content was measured by fluorescence 
quenching technique using OxyLab pO2 monitor (Oxford Optronix Ltd.) 
fiber optic probe mounted to a micromanipulator. Trachea was exposed on 
an anesthetized animal, and 23 gauge needle was used to make an open￾ing in the anterior wall of the trachea. The fiber-optic probe was inserted 
at a 45°C angle to contact the epithelium of the opposite side wall of the 
trachea. The probe was lowered until it placed gentle pressure on the wall 
and pO2 reading reduced to 5 mmHg or less (signaling compression of 
tissue). It was then raised at approximately 20-μm increments. The stable 
pO2 reading, prior to a rapid rise to at least 60 mmHg that signaled loss of 
tissue contact, was used as the tissue oxygen partial pressure.
EM studies. Tracheal allografts were excised and fixed in 1.5% glutaralde￾hyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer instilled through the trachea at 23 cm pres￾sure for 24 hours. Samples were washed with 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, post￾fixed in 1% OsO4 buffered with 0.1 M cacodylate for 1 hour, washed again 
with 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, and stained with 3% uranyl acetate for 30 
minutes. Samples were then dehydrated with grade acetone and embedded 
in plastic. Cut sections were viewed with a Philips CM10 electron micro￾scope and photographed (Advanced Microscopy Techniques).
Microarray study. To determine how the transcriptome of immune-injured 
airways compared at critical time points, RNA from tracheal allografts that 
had undergone 6 days and 10 days of rejection was studied by gene array. 
Total RNA was extracted from tracheae in TRIzol reagent and purified 
using RNeasy (Qiagen). RNA quality was evaluated with a 2100 Bio￾analyzer system (Agilent Technologies). Microarray sample labeling was 
carried out using the Affymetrix One-Cycle Target Labeling kit for reverse 
transcription and 1 round of in vitro transcription (41). Affymetrix Mouse 
Genome 430 2.0 microarrays were hybridized with 10 μg cRNA and pro￾cessed per the manufacturer’s protocol. Hybridization signals and detec￾tion calls were generated in BioConductor (42), using the rma and Affy 
packages. Microarray data were analyzed using BRB ArrayTools v3.4.1.
Delayed immunotherapy experiments. To determine whether the duration 
of rejection had any effect on the ability to prevent airway remodeling in 
acutely rejecting airways, B6 mice underwent tracheal transplant from 
BALB/c donors. Rejecting grafts were excised from the original recipient. 
Tracheae were retransplanted orthotopically into immunologically naive 
B6 mice that received immunotherapy with anti–LFA-1/anti-CD40L as 
described above. These grafts were re-excised 28 days following retrans￾plantation for histologic examination (38).
Morphometric analysis. Assessment for airway remodeling was performed 
using a ratio of subepithelial height to epithelial height. We have previously 
validated this measure as having a high degree of correlation with a chronic 
rejection scoring system (9). Image-Pro Plus Image Analysis Software (Media 
Cybernetics) was used to make 3 measurements of each variable in each 
specimen. Vessel number quantification was performed on axial tracheal 
sections with CD31 immunostain by counting total numbers of indepen￾dent CD31+ structures per entire tracheal ring (n = 5 per group). Tracheal 
whole mounts perfused with FITC-conjugated tomato lectin were assessed 
for mean fluorescent intensity using Intelligent Imaging Innovations Slide￾Book software. The same software was used to created masks based on a 
fixed FITC threshold to mask perfused blood vessels. The percentage of area 
in the mask as compared with total area was measured to create an index of 
vessel area. Three measurements were made from each specimen.
Statistics. Intergroup statistical analysis was performed using 1-way 
ANOVA with a Tukey post-test for a significance level of P < 0.05.
