Variceal hemorrhage (VH) is a major complication of gastro￾esophageal varices (GEV) and is a leading cause of mortality in
patients with cirrhosis.1,2 This review discusses esophageal
varices (EV) and gastric varices (GV) as distinct anatomic and
pathologic entities, highlighting both historical and emerging
trends in the utilization of transjugular intrahepatic portosys￾temic shunt (TIPS) and/or balloon-occluded retrograde trans￾venous obliteration (BRTO) to address VH.
TIPS and BRTO have evolved in relative isolation as
different philosophical strategies to address VH.3 TIPS is
more commonly utilized in North America and Europe
where portal decompression with or without adjunctive
embolization of varices4 has been a mainstay of endovascular
strategy. Conversely, BRTO evolved in Asia as a direct treat￾ment of VH by obliterating GEV (particularly GV) via sclero￾sis.3 These approaches were previously viewed as in conflict
with one another as BRTO eliminates the gastrorenal shunt
(GRS), aggravating portal hypertension, whereas TIPS is
designed to reduce portal hypertension.3 Increasingly, TIPS
and BRTO are viewed as complementary procedures that can
be combined in specific clinical scenarios to reduce bleeding
risk, while ameliorating sequelae of portal hypertension.
Consideration of TIPS with/without adjunctive embolization,
BRTO, or a combination of the procedures in VH requires an
understanding of GEV progression and VH.

Abstract Variceal hemorrhage is a feared complication of portal hypertension, with high rates of
morbidity and mortality. Optimal management requires a thoughtful, multidisciplinary
approach. In cases of refractory or recurrent esophageal hemorrhage, endovascular
approaches such as transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) have a well￾defined role. For hemorrhage related to gastric varices, the optimal treatment remains
to be established; however, there is increasing adoption of balloon-occluded retro￾grade transvenous obliteration (BRTO). This article will review the concept, history,
patient selection, basic technique, and outcomes for TIPS, BRTO, and combined
TIPS þ BRTO procedures for variceal hemorrhage.

Pathophysiology and Epidemiology of
Esophageal and Gastric Varices
Portal venous congestion in longstanding liver cirrhosis
triggers a multifactorial process establishing collateral flow
through GEV.5 A hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG)
 10 mm Hg is a critical threshold above which varices are
known to form.6 EV are present in 52% of screened patients
and are more prevalent with disease progression, seen in up
to 43% of patients classified as Child–Pugh class A versus 72%
in Child–Pugh class B/C.7 Comparatively, GV are less common
and are classically thought to be present in 5 to 33% of
patients with portal hypertension.8,9
GEV progression is dynamic, with both vessel diameter and
growth correlating with disease severity.10 Varices are typi￾cally classified as “small” or “large” at a threshold of 5 mm,11,12
with further subdivision incorporating a “medium” size based
on morphology.12 Conservatively, the incidence of new EV has
been reported at 7 to 9% per year13–15 and progression from
small to medium orlarge varices is reported to be 10 to 15% per
year.14–16 GV development is thought to occur in a similar
process, although studies have demonstrated that GV exist at
lower pressures than EV (11–18 vs. 16–24 mm Hg).17,18
The law of Laplace and Bernoulli’s principle describe the
pathophysiology of VH.15,19,20 GEV wall thickness decreases
as vessel diameters expand due to increased transmural
pressures from an elevated HVPG. Ultimately, hemorrhage
occurs when wall tension limits are exceeded.15,21 Although
they share similar pathophysiologic principles, esophageal
variceal hemorrhage (EVH) and gastric variceal hemorrhage
(GVH) can be stratified as unique clinical events requiring
varying treatment options.
EVH is highly prevalent given the high rates of EV in the
cirrhotic population.8,9,22 EVH occurs at a rate varying
between 5% yearly when small varices are present and 15%
yearly in the setting of medium or large varices.23 Sponta￾neous resolution of EVH has been reported in up to 40% of
patients with EVH, but 6-week mortality approaches 20% for
acute VH.12,24–26 A recent model for end-stage liver disease
(MELD)-based analysis of VH reported an overall 16% mor￾tality rate at 6 weeks, with mortality rates worsening with
disease severity, varying between 5% (MELD < 11) and 20%
(MELD  19).27 Furthermore, VH can recur in 60% of patients
within 1 to 2 years if untreated, with mortality rates as high
as 33%.28,29 A unique population is decompensated patients
with HPVG > 20 mm Hg within the first 24 hours of an acute
VH. These patients exhibit higher rates of recurrent bleeding
within 1 week, failure to control bleeding (up to 83%), and
higher mortality (up to 64%).12,30,31
Comparatively, GVH is much less common and accounts
for only 10 to 30% of VH. Although GV bleed 50% less
often than EV, GVH exhibit severe bleeding with higher
transfusion requirements.8 Furthermore, bleeding rates are
reported as high as 16% at 1 year, 36% at 3 years, and 44% at
5 years.9 Critically, GVH can occur at a lower portosystemic
gradient (PSG) than EVH. In a recent retrospective analysis,
95 patients with acute VH demonstrated EVH at significantly
higher pressures than GVH (23 vs. 17–20 mm Hg).32 These
findings mirror a previous study where bleeding occurred at
a higher PSG in EV than GV (21.4 vs. 15.8 mm Hg).33 More￾over, 10% of GV bled at a PSG < 12 mm Hg (compared with
2% for EV),32 echoing a cohort where 16% of patients with
bleeding GV had a baseline HPVG < 12 mm Hg.34
Anatomical Considerations
EV and GV exhibit anatomical characteristics that may drive
pathological behavior and response to current treatment
regimens. The Sarin classification system (►Fig. 1) is often
used to delineate GV patterns8: gastroesophageal varices
type 1 (GOV1) at the lesser curvature of the stomach,
gastroesophageal varices type 2 (GOV2) at the greater cur￾vature of the stomach, isolated gastric varices type 1 (IGV1)
at the fundal region, and isolated gastric varices type 2 (IGV2)
which are ectopic and rarely encountered. It should be noted
that BRTO typically target GOV2 and IGV1 type varices.
EV are generally supplied by the left gastric vein (94–100%)
and demonstrate “uphill” venous outflow (77–100%) through
the azygos/hemiazygos venous system. Less commonly, EV
may be supplied by the posterior gastric vein (16–25%) or short
gastric vein (3–11%).22,35 GV demonstrate a more complex
framework, with“downhill” drainage via a GRS predominating
(85%)18,35,36 or mix “uphill–downhill” venous outflow given
their proximity to the EV.22 Overall, GOV are commonly
supplied by the left gastric vein (86%) and posterior gastric
vein (67%), but less so by the short gastric vein (4%). IGV
demonstrate more complex patterning and are supplied with
more frequency by the posterior gastric vein (64–70%) and the
short gastric vein (25–64%) when compared with EV.22,35
These anatomic considerations make the management of
GVH a more complicated endeavor than that of EVH. ►Fig. 2
represents an idealized schematic of portal venous supply and
systemic venous drainage for EV and GV.
Management of Variceal Hemorrhage
Primary prophylaxis for VH is recommended in high-risk
patients with medium or large-sized GEV, utilizing either
nonselective β blockade or endoscopic variceal band ligation
(EVL).10,37 Upon failure of primary prophylaxis, management
of VH involves a multidisciplinary approach that is beginning
to more aptly address EVH and GVH as differentiated.10,37
Presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding, cirrhotic patients
undergo hemodynamic resuscitation with a hemoglobin trans￾fusion threshold of 7 g/dL and antibiotic prophylaxis, given their
susceptibility to bacterial translocation.2,10 Endoscopy is per￾formed to determine if the bleeding source is due to VH or an
arterial etiology such as peptic ulcer bleeding. Furthermore,
endoscopy provides visualization of the bleeding site, an oppor￾tunity for EVL or sclerotherapy, and exploration of variceal
anatomy.10,37 This approach is usually effective in all but 10 to
20% of patients.38 Balloon tamponade and metallic stents may
also be considered as bridge therapies until more definitive
measures may be attempted.10,37 VH that is refractory to
the aforementioned medical and endoscopic treatments may
be referred for endovascular intervention.

TIPS
History
Conceptualized in the late 1960s by Rösch et al,39,40 TIPS has
developed over nearly five decades.41 Initial experimentation
involved Teflon coaxial tubing or silicone copolymer–coated
spring coils in dogs. The silicone-coated shunt remained open
for up to 2 weeks until thrombosis whereupon the tract
remained patent for 24 to 48 hours after removal of the occluded
device.40 Further advancements were made utilizing a human
cadaveric model42 and experimentation with a balloon-dilated
shunt tract in an animal model.43 By 1982, a balloon-angio￾plasty shunt tract was utilized alongside variceal emboliza￾tion44 in a patient with acute GEV hemorrhage. This pivotal
report led to exploration of balloon-angioplasty tract formation
in a series of 20 patients with acute GEV hemorrhage.45
TIPS, as it is understood today, came to fruition in the late
1980s and early 1990s41 with the development of expand￾able metallic stents in an animal model.46 The first metallic
stents were deployed in patients in the late 1980s and early
1990s41,47–51 but faced patency issues.52,53 Biliary tract
fistulas were contributing to shunt occlusion.3,54,55 The
advent of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-covered stent
grafts has greatly improved patency.56–58
Indications/Contraindications
Indications for TIPS in the setting of VH (EV and GV) are well
demarcated by American Association for the Study of Liver
Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guidelines: (1) TIPS is indicated in
rescue therapy for acute VH that is refractory to medical and
endoscopic intervention; (2) it is also indicated in recurrent
VH despite medical and endoscopic treatment; (3) an emer￾ging indication is the early TIPS creation within 24 to
72 hours of acute VH.10
Contraindications to TIPS include prevention of VH in
varices that have not previously bled, prevention of bleeding
from gastric antral vascular ectasia, or primary therapy for
portal hypertensive gastropathy.22,59 The Society of Interven￾tional Radiology recognizes multiple relative contraindica￾tions including elevated heart pressures (left or right), heart
failure or severe valvular insufficiency, rapidly progressive
liver failure, severe or uncontrolled hepatic encephalopathy,
uncontrolled systemic infection or sepsis, unrelieved biliary
obstruction, polycystic liver disease, extensive primary or
metastatic hepatic malignancy, and a severe, uncontrolled
coagulopathy.60
Preprocedure Evaluation
Patient selection includes a preprocedure work-up involving a
combination of a complete blood count, metabolic panel, liver
function test, bilirubinlevels, and coagulation profile. Objective
risk stratification can be performed utilizing the MELD score,
which has demonstrated efficacy in early prognosis.61 Indivi￾dual patients should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
Cross-sectional imaging with contrast-enhanced com￾puted tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) can elucidate variceal pathways, demonstrate patency
of the portal, splenic, and hepatic venous systems, and reveal
unrelieved biliary obstruction, and is critical for treatment
planning. Ultrasound with Doppler can also be utilized to
demonstrate venous patency when time constraints or renal
insufficiency is present.
Technique
TIPS creation has been detailed many times over the years.62
Briefly, the procedure involves bridging a hepatic vein and a
portal vein with a bile-impermeable Viatorr (W.L. Gore, Flag￾staff, AZ) covered stent graft—which are purposely designed
for TIPS. Shunt creationwith an expandable covered stent graft
is preferred over bare metal stents to maintain durable
patency.63 Most commonly the right hepatic vein is selected
and wedged hepatic venography is performed to identify the
right portal vein. A needle is then directed to the target portal
vein, and once successful access to a portal vein branch is
achieved, direct portal pressures are obtained and used to
calculate a PSG. Splenoportal venogram is obtained to evaluate
suitability of accessed portal vein branch, identify varices, and
determine the correct length of stent, which is then deployed
through the hepatic parenchymal tract. In patients with VH,
incremental dilatation can be made with an 8- or 10-mm
balloon to reduce the PSG to a target of 12 mm Hg or less.64
Following TIPS placement, coil embolization of varices—typi￾cally left gastric vein (coronary vein)—is performed per the
operator or institutional preference. When and how to embo￾lize varices remains a point of debate, with many choosing to
embolize only varices that persistently opacify on portal
venography performed following TIPS placement (►Fig. 3).
Postprocedure Follow-up
Follow-up includes postprocedural intensive care to monitor
for resolution of VH, complications of TIPS (including pro￾cedural-related hemorrhage), and renal function, and neu￾rological monitoring for signs of hepatic encephalopathy.
Liver function and coagulation profiles are also routinely
obtained. Clinical follow-up includes ultrasound surveillance
with Doppler at 1, 3, and 6 months to ensure shunt patency
and adequate flow.
Major complications from TIPS creation are uncommon and
are reported at a rate of 3%. Selected major complications
include hemoperitoneum, biliary peritonitis, stent malposi￾tion, hemobilia, hepatic infarction, renal failure, accelerated
liver failure, and severe or uncontrolled hepatic encephalo￾pathy.60 Rarely, the decision will be made to reduce or occlude
a TIPS in the setting of uncontrollable hepatic encephalopathy
or hepatic decompensation.65 Minor complications are
reported at a rate of 4% and include hepatic encephalopathy
(controlled with medical management), transient renal failure
due to intraprocedural contrast administration, transient pul￾monary edema, fever, and access site hematoma.60
Outcomes for TIPS in Variceal Hemorrhage
Decompression of an elevated HPVG though TIPS creation
has a longstanding tradition in North America and Europe,
and a wide breadth of data are available to support its use for
the indications listed in the previous section. However, data

on the efficacy of TIPS in the setting of EV/EVH when
compared with GV/GVH are sparse because datasets often
combine these entities into GEV. Moreover, historical studies
have relied heavily on bare metal stents although PTFE￾covered stents are favored today. Contemporary debate has
bloomed around the efficacy of TIPS and the role of adjunc￾tive embolization, especially in the setting of GV.
Embolotherapy and TIPS
Variceal embolotherapy is routinely practiced during TIPS
creation41,43 and has been historically reported in 24 to 48%
of patients,66–68 though studies have reported success in
controlling VH without adjunctive embolotherapy.52,69,70
Timing of embolization (pre-TIPS vs. post-TIPS embolization),
selection of varices for embolization, and benefits of embo￾lotherapy remain contentious. In the setting of EVH, the left
gastric vein (coronary vein) is the most frequently embolized
(►Fig. 3).
Conceptually, embolotherapy of collateral varices is a
protective measure. In the era of bare metal TIPS, emboliza￾tion of collateral varices would exclude a competing shunt
that may decrease TIPS patency, limit variceal filling, and
thus limit recurrent VH due to shunt dysfunction.66,71 Pre￾TIPS embolization has the technical benefit of increased GEV
visualization due to variceal filling and decreased risk of
nontarget systemic coil embolization, as no large-caliber
shunt is present to allow systemic coil migration. Compara￾tively, post-TIPS embolotherapy provides the technical ben￾efit of having a patent shunt to access and assessment of TIPS
efficacy for variceal nonfilling.
Tesdal et al compared TIPS with embolotherapy to TIPS
alone in a prospective study of 95 patients. Patients receiving
TIPS and embolotherapy experienced a lower rebleeding rate
(19 vs. 47%) at 4 years and also determined that embolother￾apy had an independent effect on rebleeding.72 A recent
meta-analysis of six studies by Qi et al concluded that TIPS
combined with embolization conferred a significant reduc￾tion in rebleeding and improved TIPS patency at 6 months,
although no significant differences in the incidence of death
were observed.73 Overall, studies generally demonstrate
reduced rates of rebleeding with combined TIPS and embo￾lotherapy when compared with TIPS alone (►Table 1).

This significant reduction in rebleeding with TIPS and
embolotherapy was also observed in several other series
including 349 patients (retrospective),74 122 patients (pro￾spective),75 106 patients (prospective),76 and 101 patients
(retrospective).77 However, a series of 79 patients compared
TIPS with embolotherapy to TIPS alone, observing no sig￾nificant differences in rebleeding or survival.78 Similarly, no
benefit in the risk of rebleeding was seen in another retro￾spective series of 137 patients.79 Although suggestive that
adjunct embolization may reduce rebleeding, this interpre￾tation requires caution given the frequent association of
rebleeding with reduced TIPS patency, which may have
limited value with the emergence of PTFE-covered stents
and raises questions of relevance in current practice.
Current rebleeding rates range up to 10%56,80–82 and may
be related to decreased shunt dysfunction with use of PTFE￾covered stents. The use of bare metal stents was identified as
an independent risk factor for shunt dysfunction in a recent
prospective series of 154 patients with VH undergoing TIPS
and embolotherapy.83 Moreover, shunt dysfunction has been
reported in up to 70% of patients. Critically, though shunt
dysfunction played a critical role in the era of bare metal
stents, the utilization of PTFE-covered stents has demon￾strated high patency with low rates of dysfunction.57
A recent meta-analysis comparing covered stents and metal￾lic stents analyzed 14 studies (4 randomized clinical trials, 2
prospective nonrandomized studies, and 8 retrospective
studies; 2,519 patients total) and demonstrated that odds
of patency (odds ratio, OR ¼ 4.75) and survival (OR ¼ 1.85)
were significantly higher for PTFE-covered stent grafts, while
odds of rebleeding were significantly lower (OR ¼ 0.37).84
Thus, the role of embolotherapy remains uncertain in our
current era and questions about its use have been raised
given involved cost, radiation exposure, procedure duration,
and risk of postembolization syndrome.72,85
TIPS in VH, Rescue, and Emerging Early TIPS
TIPS is highly effective for rescue therapy for both EVH and
GVH. TIPS creation is almost always technically feasible and
achieves bleeding cessation in over 90% of cases of EVH57,61
and GVH.86–91 Historical rebleeding rates in GV may be
exaggerated in the era of PTFE-covered stents. Rebleeding
rates post-TIPS are recently reported to be nearly 10% in
EVH80,81 and as low as 10 to 20% in GVH.86,87,89–92
Moreover, TIPS has also long been shown to be an effective
modality for the secondary prevention of EVH. A recent meta￾analysis of 10 randomized controlled trials involving 1,076
patients compared EVL, combination EVL and medical man￾agement, and TIPS for secondary prophylaxis of esophageal
variceal bleeding93: TIPS most effectively reduced bleeding￾related mortality (relative risk, RR ¼ 5.66) and rebleeding
(RR ¼ 2.20), though overall mortality was not significantly
variable.
An emerging indication is early (nonsalvage) TIPS in the
setting of acute VH. In a landmark study, 63 patients with
acute Child–Pugh B/C VH were randomly assigned to early
TIPS creation within 72 hours with a PTFE stent versus
medical and endoscopic therapy. Early PTFE TIPS creation
yielded higher rates of bleeding control (97 vs. 50%), 6-week
survival (97 vs. 67%), and 1-year actuarial survival (86 vs.
61%).80 These results were validated in 2013 with similar
bleeding control (93 vs. 53%) and 1-year actuarial survival
reported (86 vs. 70%) in a retrospective analysis.81,94 How￾ever, in a prospective study matching 31 patients receiving
early TIPS and medical/endoscopic treatment with historical
cohort whose patients did not receive early TIPS, no sig￾nificant difference was noted in actuarial 1-year survival,
though significantly more patients who received early TIPS
remained free of rebleeding events (97 vs. 51%).95
Furthermore, a meta-analysis analyzing early TIPS within
the first 5 days of VH in 608 cirrhotic patients revealed a
significant risk reduction in 1-year mortality (RR ¼ 0.68)
and variceal rebleeding (RR ¼ 0.28).96 Similarly, a retrospec￾tive analysis of 142,539 patients with EVH revealed that
when compared with no TIPS, early TIPS demonstrated
significantly decreased inpatient mortality (RR ¼ 0.87) and
rebleeding (RR ¼ 0.56) without significant increases in
hepatic encephalopathy (HE).97 A prospective observational
studying of 964 patients with gastrointestinal bleeding in
France revealed that 1-year actuarial survival was signifi￾cantly increased in the 22 patients receiving early TIPS (86 vs.
59%), though rebleeding events were not recorded.98
Effectiveness in EV versus GV
Although TIPS can establish control of acute GVH, it may not
be as efficacious in this setting as GV persist and bleed at
lower PSGs than EV.3,17,32,33 Though historically studies have
often discussed the two as a single entity and direct compar￾isons between rebleeding rates in EV and GV have demon￾strated no difference in rates of rebleeding,33,86,99 emerging
data demonstrate that EV and GV respond differently to
current treatment strategies. In a recent retrospective study
of 78 patients with GVH who underwent TIPS creation with
or without adjunctive embolization, GV remained patent
(65%) with high rates of rebleeding (27%) and mortality at
90 days reported to be 15%. These findings echo a similar
result where 50% of patients undergoing TIPS had persistent
GV and 27% rebleed rate was reported.100
There are several postulations as to why TIPS may not be as
effective for establishing control of GV: (1) “proximity,” (2)
“throughput,” and (3) “recruitment.” The “proximity” theory3
suggests that EV are well decompressed by TIPS because the
primary vessel supplying these varices—theleft gastric vein—is
small enough and close enough to benefit from shunt creation.
Conversely, as GV are larger caliber and anatomically remote
from the TIPS shunt, they are likely not as susceptible to
decompression as EV and have been observed to be persistent
in this scenario.72,101 The “throughput” theory3 is based on the
concept of low-pressure shunts from large-caliber inflow and
outflow vessels associated with GV. These vessels may ulti￾mately compete with TIPS and, in effect, decompress the shunt
itself. The “recruitment” theory101 describes the development
of new inflow feeding vessels after embolization of a GV
complex, analogous to treating an arteriovenous malforma￾tion. Thus, the challenging nature of these varices prompts
consideration of obliterative approaches.

BRTO
History
The first case example of retrograde gastric variceal oblitera￾tionin theliteraturewas by Olson et alin 1984 at the University
of Indiana. A patient who had undergone two previous trans￾hepatic coil embolizations of bleeding EV was found to have
numerous short gastric veins feeding large GV, which drained
via a spontaneous GRS. With too many feeding vessels to coil,
the authors had the insight to place an occlusion balloon in the
spontaneous GRS above the inflow into the left renal vein, and
reflux absolute ethanol into the varices, thereby sclerosing
them.102 In context, the first TIPS was performed in a human
4 years later by Richter et al in Germany.103
The modern concept and technical advancement of the
procedure as it is now known was developed by Kanagawa
et al in Japan in the 1990s, and he coined the term balloon￾occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO).104
Indications/Contraindications
After long experience in Asia, BRTO has been increasingly
adopted in the United States and Europe for the treatment of
GV over the past decade. It is used primarily for prevention of
recurrent GV bleeding, and has recently been included in the
American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)
practice guidelines for this indication alongside TIPS.10 Some
experienced centers have also used BRTO as primary pro￾phylaxis, but this indication has not been widely adopted—
similar to TIPS, BRTO is not recommended in the new AASLD
guidelines for primary prophylaxis of GV bleeding.10,105
Despite decades of use in Asia, and increasing adoption in
the United States and Europe, defined patient selection for
BRTO are lacking. Typically, it is utilized in patients who are
at high risk for TIPS including elevated MELD (>18), right￾sided heart failure, or hepatic encephalopathy.
Major contraindications include portal or splenic vein
thrombosis without other portosystemic collaterals to provide
adequate mesenteric or splenic venous outflow following
BRTO, which can result in bowel or splenic ischemia secondary
to venous congestion. Relative contraindications include a lack
of a GRS, although experienced centers have success perform￾ing BRTO via nontraditional shunts such as the inferior phrenic
vein.106
Preprocedure Evaluation
As with TIPS, patients should previously have undergone
endoscopic evaluation to confirm presence of GV as source of
hemorrhage, or be at high risk for bleeding. Endoscopy is also
necessary to evaluate for presence of preexisting EV, which
may need to be banded. Cross-sectional (CT or MRI) imaging
is critical to establishing candidacy for BRTO and for planning
purposes. Evaluation of imaging includes: (1) confirming
presence of catheterizable GRS (►Fig. 4c); (2) confirmation
and location of GV (►Fig. 4a); (3) patency of portal and
splenic veins; (4) presence of additional systemic collaterals
that may need to be embolized (e.g., inferior phrenic vein);
(5) identification of inflow portal branches (e.g., short and
posterior gastric veins; ►Fig. 4b); and (6) identify additional
sequelae of portal hypertension such as ascites that may
suggest benefit of adjunctive TIPS placement. Good prepro￾cedure imaging evaluation can ensure that appropriate
equipment is available for the procedure (e.g., occlusion
balloon of appropriate size for the GRS), and save time by
suggesting the best approach to catheterizing the shunt (e.g.,
transfemoral vs. transjugular) based on the coronal relation￾ship of the inferior vena cava (IVC), left renal vein, and GRS.
Laboratory evaluation including renal and liver panels, com￾plete blood count, and coagulation panel should be obtained,
and coagulopathy addressed as necessary. MELD calculation
is useful to stratify mortality related to TIPS placement, and
can be helpful to suggest which patients may benefit from
BRTO based on elevated risk of TIPS placement.
Technique
Multiple detailed descriptions of the basic technique and
modifications are available.104,107–111 Briefly, the goal of
BRTO is to trap sclerosant within the GV by controlling
both inflow and the outflow of the GV. Inflow is controlled
by relying on the inflow portal pressure to ensure sclerosant
is not refluxed into the portal venous system. The outflow is
controlled by temporarily occluding the outflow GRS with an
occlusion balloon. Thus, the first step is to catheterize the
GRS. This can be performed via transfemoral or transjugular
approaches, with the optimal approach dependent on opera￾tor preference and anatomic relationship of the GRS, left
renal vein, and IVC. Once the GRS is catheterized, an appro￾priately size occlusion balloon is positioned above the left
adrenal vein confluence and inflated to arrest flow. In large
shunts, a balloon smaller than the maximum diameter of the
shunt can often be placed above a web or stenosis that
frequently exists in the GRS, and can gently be pulled
down after inflating, a technique referred to as “corking”
the balloon. With the occlusion balloon inflated, contrast is
injected by hand, and a balloon-occluded retrograde veno￾gram (BORV) is obtained. If systemic collateral outflow
vessels are identified and result in significant “leakage”
without visualization of the GV, they are embolized using
coils, vascular plugs, gelatin sponge (Gelfoam; Pfizer, New
York, NY), or sclerosant. After embolization of the systemic
collaterals, repeat BORV is performed to confirm visualiza￾tion of the GV (►Fig. 4d). A microcatheter is placed coaxially
through the occlusion balloon, ideally all the way into the GV,
and the sclerosant is instilled via the microcatheter
(►Fig. 4f). Multiple sclerosant agents have been used. In
the United States, most published experience is with 3%
sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STS), which is mixed with air to
create a foam, and ethiodized oil for fluoroscopic visibility. A
typical mixture consists of a 3:2:1 mixture of air to sclerosant
to ethiodized oil112 (►Fig. 4e). Foamed sclerosant is advan￾tageous as it maximized contact with the vessel wall, mini￾mizing the overall amount required compared with pure
liquid sclerosis and theoretically minimizing systemic toxi￾city. Instillation of the sclerosant is stopped after the GV are
filled, and portal inflow vessel is identified. Intraprocedural
C-arm cone-beam CT can be helpful to confirm adequate
sclerosant in the GV, identify the portal inflow vessel,

confirming the end point for sclerosant administration
(►Fig. 4g,h). The microcatheter is removed, and the scler￾osant is allowed to dwell for a minimum of 4 hours while the
occlusion balloon remains inflated. When the occlusion
balloon is deflated, fluoroscopy is used to ensure stability
of the sclerosant in the GV prior to balloon removal. Mod￾ifications exist which replace occlusion balloon with coils or
vascular plugs to expedite this step and improve logistics.113
Recent adaptations of the technique use coils (coil-assisted
retrograde transvenous obliteration) or plugs (plug-assisted
retrograde transvenous obliteration) to occlude the GRS
rather than an occlusion balloon, and gelatin sponge slurry
rather than foamed sclerosant to obliterate the GV.114,115
These techniques can enhance logistics by eliminating the
4-hour balloon inflation time, and can result in obliteration
of large-diameter shunts with smaller-diameter devices.
Postprocedure Follow-up
Following BRTO, the patient is observed overnight in the
hospital. A postembolization syndrome including upper
abdominal or flank pain, fevers, and occasionally leukocy￾tosis can be encountered, and may be related to the large clot
burden intentionally generated during the procedure. Symp￾toms typically respond to conservative management with
anti-inflammatory and analgesic medications as necessary.
Hydration is encouraged to minimize systemic toxicity of
sclerosants. Cross-sectional imaging is obtained within
1 week to ensure complete thrombosis of the varices, and
early repeat treatment with BRTO, BATO, or endoscopic
obliteration should be performed if there is persistent flow
in the varices to minimize bleeding risk. Coordination with
the referring hepatologist is critical to maintain routine
scheduled upper endoscopy to evaluate and treat aggrava￾tion of EV, although formal guidelines are lacking.
The complication profile of BRTO can be subdivided into
early procedural-related complications and later physiologic
“complications” related to expected increase in portal hyper￾tension. A large meta-analysis including 1,016 patients demon￾strated a low overall major complication rate of 2.6%, and
included small numbers of pulmonary emboli (4 patients),
portal or splenic vein thrombosis (11 patients), renal vein
thrombosis (3 patients), extravasation of sclerosant (5 patients),

and death (2 patients).116 Major vessel thrombosis rates have
been noted to be higher in other studies; however, major vessel
thrombosis appears to be self-limited andwell toleratedwhenit
results from spilling of the foamed sclerosant.117 Balloon rup￾ture has been reportedin up to 9%.118Respiratory effects related
to sclerosant usage is relatively uncommon, and appears even
less frequent with use of STS compared with ethanolamine
oleate, the sclerosing agent most typically used in Japan.119,120
Technically successful BRTO by definition closes a natu￾rally occurring decompressive portosystemic shunt, and
would be expected to increase the PSG, thereby potentially
exacerbating sequelae of portal hypertension. This has been
validated by studies demonstrating an increased incidence
or worsening of preexisting EV. The reported rates are
variable, and it appears to be a time-dependent phenomena,
with one study reporting worsening rates of 27, 58, and 66%
at 1, 3, and 5 years post-BRTO, respectively.121 Similarly,
worsening of ascites is variably reported in up to 35%, and
likely depends on whether detected incidentally on imaging
or defined as clinically evident or requiring therapy.122

Outcomes
A recent meta-analysis by Park et al compiled postprocedure
outcomes in 1,016 patients across 24 studies for those who
underwent BRTO for the management of GV,116 and reflects
results representative of the modern experience with gastric
variceal obliteration. Technical success (also called immediate
clinical success)—defined as complete thrombosis of GV on
immediate or short-term follow-up imaging, successful injec￾tion of sclerosing agent into GV, and control of actively bleeding
GV—was observed in 96.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 93.7–
98.3) of patients. Clinical success, defined as no recurrence or
rebleeding of bleeding GV (or no futurebleedin high-risk GV) or
complete obliteration of varices on subsequent imaging, was
evident in 97.3% (95% CI: 95.2–98.8) of patients. Overall, these
results suggest that BRTO is an effective and safe intervention
for the management of GV. Of note, however, 23 of the included
studies were retrospective, while only 1 was prospective,
relegating a majority of the evidence to level 2 data. Addition￾ally, only one of the studies included patients from the United
States, while the other 23 spanned patients from either Japan or
Korea. This regional disparity narrows the overall generaliz￾ability of the analysis due to population demographics. More￾over, the slant toward studies from the far east may artificially
raise the cumulative clinical success rate, as BRTO is more often
performed as prophylaxis in nonbleeding high-risk varices (for
which it is unclear that bleeding would have ever occurred) in
Asia, versus for bleeding GV in the United States.
The clinical outcomes of TIPS versus BRTO were described
in a meta-analysis performed by Wang et al in 2016.123 In
collating 353 total patients (210 BRTO, 143 TIPS patients), the
authors found no significant difference in procedure techni￾cal success (BRTO: 88% vs. TIPS: 98%, p ¼ 0.06), hemostasis
rate (BRTO: 100% vs. TIPS: 94%, p ¼ 0.30), or complication
rate (BRTO: 10% vs. TIPS: 5%, p ¼ 0.79). However, rebleeding
incidence (BRTO: 7% vs. TIPS: 23%, p ¼ 0.02) and HE rate
(BRTO: 1% vs. TIPS: 30%, p < 0.00001) favored obliteration.
Combination TIPS þ Obliteration
The decision to pursue decompressive strategies via TIPS, or
obliterative strategies via BRTO, does not need to binary, but
rather can be combined to utilize the comparative advantages
of each procedure. This is particularly helpful in the treatment
of GV. As discussed, GV are often related to large, high-flow
GRSs. Thus, obliteration of the GV results in the elimination of
this shunt, reducing the bleeding risk inherent to GV. The
resultant expected increase in portal pressures and attendant
increased riskof new/worsening ascites, aggravation of EV, and
formation of difficult-to-treat ectopic varices can be amelio￾rated by the simultaneous or staged placement of TIPS. The
combined result is the elimination of a high-flow spontaneous
portosystemic shunt that is at risk for life-threatening hemor￾rhage (the GRS and gastric variceal complex), whichis replaced
by a man-made endovascularly created portosystemic shunt
(TIPS) that is not at risk for rupture. Because flow rates are
often higher through the GRS than through the TIPS, porto￾systemic shunting is expected to be reduced following the
combined procedure, theoretically resulting in decreased risk
of encephalopathy compared with TIPS placement alone.
Furthermore, TIPS patency may also be improved, as closure
of competitive portosystemic shunts has been shown to
improve short-term TIPS patency, also decreasing short-term
variceal rebleeding rates.76
As mentioned previously, there is increasing evidence
that EV and GV are distinct both in terms of anatomy and
response to therapy. This is supported by studies demon￾strating GV bleeding at lower PSG compared with EV, includ￾ing evidence that GV can bleed at PSG < 12 mm Hg.32
Furthermore, GV were found to have similar patency rates
after TIPS placement, whether or not they were previously
embolized.101 This suggests that definitive treatment of GV
may require obliteration rather than simple embolization.
Thus, in the case of GV, TIPS, even with embolization, may be
inadequate therapy, although a reduction in bleeding rates
from the addition of BRTO to TIPS has yet to be described.124
In addition to the physiologic advantages proposed, com￾bining the procedures results in some technical advantages as
well. When performing traditional BRTO, particularly early in
one’s experience, it can be difficult to elucidate the relevant
anatomy. This is predominantly a result of the retrograde
venography in which all of the afferent feeding veins may
not be apparent during BORV. Additionally, complex systemic
outflow may require time-consuming embolization prior to
the instillation of sclerosant. When performing an obliteration
after TIPS, the entirety of the afferent supply and efferent
drainage of the GV can be seen during the trans-TIPS portal
venogram. This improved anatomic delineation of the GV
supply and drainage allows for easier planning of the ultimate
GV obliteration. Finally, having control of the inflow (via a
combination of embolization and occlusion balloons) in addi￾tion to standard control of the outflow (via plug embolization)
may result in improved trapping of the sclerosant in the target
GV and reduced likelihood of sclerosant migration into non￾target vascular territories.
Conversely, TIPS can occasionally be made technically less
challenging when staged after BRTO. This is because it is
often noted that patients with large GV have relatively
diminutive portal veins as the spontaneous shunt siphons
large amounts of blood away from the liver. These small
portal veins can be challenging to target during a standard
TIPS and may require adjunctive techniques to gain portal
vein access, which can increase procedure time, risk, and
expense.103,125–128 In the authors’ experience, following
BRTO the portal vein is often larger in caliber as the pre￾viously shunted blood is redirected to the liver, resulting in
easier targeting during subsequent TIPS.
Finally, there can be a logistical advantage of combining or
staging TIPS þ obliteration by eliminating the need for pro￾longed balloon inflation times used in traditional BRTO
techniques. As described in the technique section in the
following, the GV are securely “trapped” by embolizing the
inflow and outflow vessels with a combination of vascular
plugs and coils, and an occlusion balloon is only briefly
necessary during the instillation of sclerosant, after which
it is quickly removed following embolization of that final
remaining inflow vessel with coils. This removes the need for

observation in the intensive care unit (ICU) during which the
balloon is inflated, and decreases the overall time of the
procedure as well as the associated resource utilization.
Technique
At the authors’ institution, we typically prefer to perform
TIPS þ obliteration in a planned staged fashion, beginning
with TIPS. Following TIPS placement via previously described
techniques, a thorough splenoportal venogram is obtained
(►Fig. 5c,d). It is imperative to image from the splenic hilum
all the way to the newly created TIPS, to identify all potential
inflow vessels to the GV. The predominate inflow vessel to
the GV is identified and initially preserved, while all other
inflows are embolized via coils or vascular plugs. Next, the
GRS is catheterized in a retrograde fashion from the left renal
vein via a transfemoral or transjugular approach in a similar
fashion as a BRTO. Suitably sized vascular plugs or coils are
used to embolize the outflow. An occlusion balloon is placed
into the remaining inflow vessel via a trans-TIPS approach,
and a microcatheter is placed coaxially through the balloon
deep into the GV. The sclerosant is then instilled via the
microcatheter until the GV are filled (►Fig. 5e). The scler￾osant foam is the same 3:2:1 mixture of air: sclerosant:
lipiodol as described for BRTO. The microcatheter is then
used to coil embolize the remaining inflow vessel prior to
deflation and removal of the occlusion balloon. Final sple￾noportal venogram is performed to confirm no further flow
through the GV (►Fig. 5f).
Postprocedure Follow-up
Follow-up combines elements of both TIPS and BRTO follow￾up algorithms. The patient is observed for complications
overnight in the hospital—this can be in an ICU setting if the
TIPS was difficult or complicated. As with BRTO, intravenous
hydration is encouraged to minimize systemic toxicity of
sclerosants. Cross-sectional imaging is obtained within

1 week to ensure complete thrombosis of the varices, and
repeat treatment with BATO should be performed if there is
persistent flow in the varices to minimize bleeding risk.
Routine scheduled ultrasound surveillance of the TIPS
should be obtained to optimize patency. Routine endoscopic
follow-up is typically not necessary assuming technically
successful obliteration and final PSG < 12 mm Hg, and the
TIPS remains patent on follow-up ultrasound.
Outcomes
There is a paucity of data with internal controls evaluating
the effectiveness of TIPS with obliteration. A 2013 study by
Saad et al evaluated 36 patients undergoing BRTO for GV, of
which 9 had TIPS (either previously placed or concurrently
placed). The ascites/hydrothorax free rate for BRTO only
versus BRTO þ TIPS at 6, 12, and 24 months was 58, 43,
and 29% versus 100, 100, and 100%, respectively
(p ¼ 0.01),124 suggesting a protective effect of portal decom￾pression complementing GV obliteration from BRTO. There
was also a significant reduction in recurrent hemorrhage for
the BRTO versus BRTO þTIPS groups at the same time points:
9, 9, and 21% versus 0, 0, and 0%, respectively (p ¼ 0.03),124
also suggestive of a protective effect of TIPS against other
sources of portal hypertension–related bleeding besides GV,
which could be aggravated by BRTO.
Conclusion
Over the past few decades, TIPS and BRTO have cemented
themselves as foundational procedures in the interventional
radiology armamentarium for the treatment of variceal bleed￾ing. While varying in their underlying mechanism—namely
portal pressure decompression versus direct variceal eradica￾tion—both are associated with high technical and clinical
success rates, allowing effective control of hemorrhage from
GEV. Future experience will dictate whether different variceal
subtypes warrant specific therapies, and whether combina￾tion approaches confer benefit over either therapy alone.
