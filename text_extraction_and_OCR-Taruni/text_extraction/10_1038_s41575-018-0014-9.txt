Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects 25% 
of the global adult population and is the most common 
chronic liver disease worldwide1
. On the basis of disease 
severity, NAFLD is divided into NAFL and nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH). The latter is characterized by 
histological lobular inflammation and hepatocyte bal￾looning and is associated with faster fibrosis progression 
than NAFL2
. With ongoing liver injury, some patients 
will progress to cirrhosis and develop various liver￾related complications. In the USA, NASH has already 
become the second or third leading cause of end-stage 
liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)3
.
Because of the association between NAFLD and 
metabolic syndrome, lifestyle modification can resolve 
hepatic steatosis and NASH and improve liver fibrosis 
(Fig. 1). However, few patients can achieve the target 
weight reduction, and even fewer can adhere to lifestyle 
changes in the long term4,5
. Therefore, some patients 
with NASH require pharmacological treatment. At 
present, there is no registered treatment for NASH, but 
current guidelines have endorsed the use of vitamin E 
or pioglitazone in selected patients with biopsy-proven 
NASH6–8
, and four drugs (obeticholic acid, elafibranor, 
selonsertib and cenicriviroc) have entered phase III 
development9
. According to the current requirements 
of the FDA and the European Medicines Agency, new 
drugs for NASH can be conditionally registered if they 
are shown to resolve NASH without worsening of liver 
fibrosis or if they improve fibrosis without worsen￾ing NASH as assessed by paired liver biopsy samples, 
whereas full registration depends on the drug effect on 
clinical outcomes (such as progression to cirrhosis, cir￾rhotic complications and liver-related deaths). Although 
a drug can be used in the clinic after conditional regis￾tration, it can be withdrawn eventually if it fails to show 
an effect on clinical outcomes.
Thus, liver biopsy is heavily relied upon to assess the 
severity of NAFLD, select patients for pharmacological 
treatment, monitor disease progression or treatment 
response and develop new drugs. However, liver biopsy 
is an invasive procedure with a small risk of complica￾tions such as bleeding10. Although repeated liver biopsy 
might be acceptable in the clinical trial setting, it is 
unlikely to be widely accepted in the real world. Besides, 
liver biopsy is not a genuine gold standard. As a biopsy 
specimen represents only ~1/50,000 of the liver volume, 
sampling bias and underestimation of disease severity is 
common. Studies have also consistently demonstrated 
considerable interobserver variability in the assessment 
of NASH features such as lobular inflammation and 
ballooning (discussed later)11. There is an urgent need 
to find better ways to assess patients with NAFLD.
It is, however, important to note that liver biopsy has 
been the main reference standard for the evaluation of

Abstract | Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects 25% of the global adult population and 
is the most common chronic liver disease worldwide. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the 
active form of NAFLD, with hepatic necroinflammation and faster fibrosis progression. With an 
increasing number of patients developing NASH-related end-stage liver disease and 
pharmacological treatments on the horizon, there is a pressing need to develop NAFLD and 
NASH biomarkers for prognostication, selection of patients for treatment and monitoring. This 
requirement is particularly true as liver biopsy utility is limited by its invasive nature, poor patient 
acceptability and sampling variability. This article reviews current and potential biomarkers for 
different features of NAFLD, namely, steatosis, necroinflammation and fibrosis. For each 
biomarker, we evaluate its accuracy, reproducibility, responsiveness, feasibility and limitations. 
We cover biochemical, imaging and genetic biomarkers and discuss biomarker discovery in the 
omics era.

biomarkers of NAFLD. As liver biopsy is imperfect, even 
a perfect biomarker would seem imperfect on the basis 
of discordance between the two12. One possible solution 
is to compare their correlations with clinical outcomes 
such as HCC, cirrhotic complications and liver￾related death — after all, identifying patients who will 
develop these complications is the ultimate reason for 
liver assessments.
In this Review, we discuss noninvasive biomarkers 
that are currently available or under development for 
the assessment of NAFLD. The biomarkers are classi￾fied according to their role in the diagnosis of NAFLD, 
NASH and fibrosis and cirrhosis. Other than biochem￾ical markers, we also discuss imaging studies, genetic 
tests and new information from the omics era. When 
applicable, we evaluate biomarkers by their accuracy 
(diagnosing what they intend to diagnose), reprodu￾cibility (providing the same results when repeated), 
responsiveness (changes in biomarkers corresponding 
to changes in biological processes), feasibility (required 
instruments, manpower or setting) and limitations. 
For brevity, the full details of these biomarker charac￾teristics are recorded in the table accompanying each 
section. Although this article focuses mainly on the 
diagnosis of NAFLD, NASH and fibrosis and cirrhosis, 
it is recognized that different biomarkers are needed for 
monitoring disease progression or regression, predicting 
or assessing treatment response, prognostication, moni￾toring treatment safety and evaluating disease suscep￾tibility. Many of these applications, however, require 
longitudinal outcome studies and data from clinical 
trials, and should be a research priority.
Diagnosis of NAFLD
The diagnosis of NAFLD is based on the detection of 
hepatic steatosis (steatosis in ≥5% of hepatocytes by 
histology or intrahepatic triglyceride content ≥5.5% 
by MRI) and exclusion of other liver diseases by history 
and appropriate investigations6,8,13. Diagnosis is the 
first step to trigger further evaluation of the severity 
of NAFLD. Although some biomarkers can quantify 
hepatic steatosis with varying accuracy, the absolute 
amount of steatosis is not prognostically important14. 
In fact, steatosis can disappear when NAFLD progresses 
to cirrhosis, and it is currently believed that this ‘burnt￾out’ NASH is the principal aetiology underlying most 
cases of cryptogenic cirrhosis15.
Blood biomarkers and panels
There are several indices and scores developed to 
assess hepatic steatosis (Table 1). The fatty liver index 
(FLI) comprises BMI, waist circumference and serum 
levels of triglycerides and gamma-glutamyltransferase 
(GGT)16. FLI has moderate accuracy in diagnosing fatty 
liver as determined by ultrasonography (area under the 
receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC) 0.84). 
In a population study in Italy, FLI correlated with insu￾lin resistance and predicted all-cause, liver-related and 
cancer mortality17. The hepatic steatosis index (HSI) 
was derived and validated in a large cohort of>10,000 
individuals who underwent health check-ups18. HSI 
includes five components (serum aspartate aminotrans￾ferase (AST):alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio, BMI, 
gender and presence of diabetes mellitus) and has a 
moderate accuracy to detect fatty liver as determined 
by ultrasonography (AUROC 0.81)18. The key limita￾tion of FLI and HSI is the use of a suboptimal reference 
standard, as diagnosis of fatty liver by ultrasonogra￾phy could be operator-dependent and insensitive for 
mild steatosis19.
A more sensitive and quantitative reference stand￾ard to estimate liver fat content — proton magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy (1
H-MRS) — was used to 
derive the NAFLD liver fat score20. This algorithm 
includes the presence of the metabolic syndrome 
and type 2 diabetes mellitus, fasting serum insulin 
concentration, serum AST levels and AST:ALT ratio. 
NAFLD liver fat score had very good accuracy to diag￾nose fatty liver (AUROC 0.86–0.87), which is defined 
as a liver fat content≥5.56%20. The inclusion of serum 
insulin level, which is not a routine test, in the formula 
might limit its wider clinical use.
Panels with more specialized parameters are 
also available to predict hepatic steatosis. SteatoTest 
(Biopredictive, Paris, France) was constructed using 
a combination of the six components of FibroTest–
ActiTest (Biopredictive; comprising serum levels of 
total bilirubin, GGT, α2-macroglobulin (α2m), hapto￾globin, ALT and apolipoprotein AI) plus BMI and 
Key points
•	When assessing a patient with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the key 
histological features of interest include the degree of steatosis, necroinflammation 
and fibrosis.
•	MRI-estimated proton density fat fraction is currently the most accurate test to 
quantify hepatic steatosis and can be considered the gold standard.
•	Magnetic resonance elastography is the most accurate fibrosis test, yet its use is 
limited by cost and availability.
•	Controlled attenuation parameter and liver stiffness measurement by transient 
elastography also enables simultaneous assessment of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, 
albeit with lower accuracy and success rates than MRI-based methods.
•	Plasma cytokeratin 18 (CK18) fragment levels are a marker of hepatocyte apoptosis 
and represent the most extensively evaluated biomarker of steatohepatitis, although 
the accuracy is modest.
•	A number of gene polymorphisms (such as those in PNPLA3 and TM6SF2) have been 
shown to correlate with NAFLD and its severity, yet their role in patient assessment 
remains to be established.

serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides and 
glucose adjusted for age and gender21. SteatoTest has 
moderate accuracy to predict biopsy-proven hepatic 
steatosis (AUROC 0.79–0.80). Aside from the cost of 
the biochemical assays, there is an additional charge 
for calculating the scores using the proprietary Steato
Test formula.
In the past decade, the availability of electronic health 
records has facilitated large-scale epidemiological stud￾ies. However, although demographic and laboratory 
data in such records are robust, clinical observations 
and anthropometric measurements are often missing. 
To facilitate registry research, the NAFLD ridge score 
was developed using a machine learning approach based 
only on laboratory parameters (serum levels of ALT, 
HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) 
and leukocyte count) and comorbidity data (and the 
presence of hypertension)22. Using 1
H-MRS as the refer￾ence standard, the NAFLD ridge score has good overall 
accuracy (AUROC 0.87) and an excellent negative pre￾dictive value of 96% to exclude NAFLD. Nonetheless, 
although these indices can be good for detecting or even 
quantifying hepatic steatosis in cross-sectional studies, 
they are less accurate in assessing changes in liver fat 
over time23.
Imaging biomarkers
Ultrasonography. Conventional ultrasonography is 
the most common method for detecting steatosis 
because of its ready availability and low cost13. Using 
ultrasonography, a steatotic liver appears brighter 
than surrounding structures because of the increased 
soundwave scatter and attenuation from lipid-laden 
vesicles. Moderate to severe steatosis can be identi￾fied with high accuracy (AUROC 0.93)24. However, 
the ability to detect steatosis in patients with NASH 
is limited by the presence of advanced fibrosis, with 
ultrasonography being less sensitive for steatosis in 
this patient group than in patients without advanced 
fibrosis25. It is also limited by both interobserver and 
intraobserver variability.
Controlled attenuation parameter. The controlled 
attenuation parameter (CAP) is a method for grad￾ing steatosis by measuring the degree of ultrasound 
attenuation by hepatic fat using a process based on 
simultaneous transient elastography26. Results are 
measured in dB/m over a range of 100–400 dB/m. 
CAP is now available with both M and XL probes, 
which cater to patients with different body builds. In a 
meta-analysis of 2,735 patients (only 20% of whom had 
NAFLD), the AUROCs were 0.82 for the diagnosis of 
any steatosis versus no steatosis and 0.87 for grade 2 or 3 
steatosis versus grade 0 or 1 steatosis26.
MRI. The MRI-estimated proton density fat fraction 
(MRI-PDFF) is an imaging-based biomarker that ena￾bles fat mapping of the entire liver. MRI-PDFF maps 
can be generated within seconds and can be analysed 
after minimal training to recognizing liver segments 
and avoid artefacts. This technology is more accurate 
than CAP in detecting all grades of steatosis in patients 
with NAFLD27 (AUROC 0.99). Liver fat content esti￾mated by MRI-PDFF correlates with that measured 
by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and is 
more sensitive than the histology-determined steato￾sis grade in quantifying changes in the liver fat content 
over time28.
MRS-PDFF provides a biochemical measure of liver 
fat in small regions of interest. MRS-PDFF is a research 
tool requiring special coils, is time consuming, is not 
routinely available and will unlikely be used in clinical 
practice because of the complexities of its logistics and 
the lack of required expertise at most clinical imag￾ing centres29. Full sensitivity and specificity values for 
detection of liver fat of varying extents by MRS are given 
in Table 1.
Summary and recommendations
Abdominal ultrasonography is the most commonly 
used method to diagnose fatty liver in routine clinical 
settings because of its wide availability and low cost 
relative to MRI-PDFF and MRS. CAP measurement by 
transient elastography (FibroScan) is a more objective 
alternative to conventional ultrasonography. However, 
its responsiveness to changes in steatosis has not been 
established, making its use as an outcome measure in 
clinical trials premature. MRI-PDFF is highly accurate

Fig. 1 | Management of NAFLD according to disease severity. Resolution of NASH and 
improvement in fibrosis can be achieved in patients who lose≥10% body weight, but this 
target can be achieved in only 10–20% of patients. Although there are no data on the 
effectiveness of lifestyle modification on outcomes in patients with NASH-related 
cirrhosis, lifestyle advice would facilitate management of metabolic diseases in these 
individuals. Statins have a minimal effect on NASH yet are safe to use in patients with 
chronic liver diseases and have established cardiovascular benefits. Vitamin E can 
improve NASH but not fibrosis. High-dose vitamin E (≥400 international units daily) 
might increase all-cause mortality. Pioglitazone can improve NASH but has no or a mild 
effect on fibrosis. Adverse effects include weight gain, an increased risk of bladder cancer 
and osteoporosis and potentially fluid retention. Liraglutide promotes weight reduction, 
can improve NASH and might prevent fibrosis progression. Gastrointestinal adverse 
effects and the need for injections hinder its use, and efficacy data are limited. Bariatric 
surgery can reverse NASH and improve fibrosis and is safe in patients with compensated 
liver disease. However, until further data are available, its use is limited to patients with 
morbid obesity. Screening for varices and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) might reduce 
the risk of death from these complications. As the absolute incidence of HCC in patients 
without cirrhosis is very low, screening all patients with non-cirrhotic NAFLD for HCC is 
not currently cost-effective.

and reproducible and can be considered the gold stan￾dard for steatosis measurement. It can be used in clinical 
trials to detect steatosis changes, but its application in 
routine clinical practice is limited by cost and availabil￾ity. The performance of blood biomarkers and panels is 
modest compared with imaging biomarkers, but these 
instruments can be readily applied in retrospective 
databases for large epidemiological studies.
Diagnosis of NASH
NASH is associated with faster fibrosis progression 
than NAFL and is currently the main target for phar￾macological treatment. Patients with NASH are more 
likely to develop cirrhosis and die from cardiovascu￾lar and liver-related causes, although the prognostic 
importance of NASH is attenuated after adjustment for 
fibrosis stage14. This finding could be because of the 
dynamic nature of NAFLD; a snapshot view of disease 
activity might not be very informative. The diagnosis 
of NASH depends on liver biopsy and is also limited 
by interobserver variability among pathologists. In 
2014, Bedossa and colleagues proposed the Fatty Liver 
Inhibition of Progression (FLIP) algorithm to improve 
the consistency of NASH diagnosis on the basis of 
histological steatosis, activity and fibrosis scores30. 
Instead of using global assessment by pathologists, the 
FLIP algorithm requires pathologists to follow stan￾dard criteria to score individual histological features 
and diagnose NASH.
Blood biomarkers and panels
The pathogenesis of liver injury in NASH is complex 
and involves numerous hormonal, cellular and molecu￾lar disturbances9
. This intricacy has led to the examina￾tion of a multitude of potential NASH biomarkers that 
reflect underlying disease pathways, including hepato￾cellular apoptosis, inflammation, oxidative stress and 
abnormal adipokine signalling (Table 2). Serum amino￾transaminase levels remain the most commonly used 
blood parameter for assessment of chronic liver dis￾ease, including NASH; however, ALT levels in isolation 
are poorly predictive of NASH and correlate best with 
hepatic triglyceride levels31,32.
Individual blood biomarkers. Hepatocyte death via 
apoptosis or necroptosis is increased in NASH com￾pared with simple steatosis and leads to the release 
of cytokeratin 18 (CK18; also known as KRT18) 
fragments. CK18 is the major intermediate filament 
protein within hepatocytes and is cleaved during initia￾tion of cell death, which leads to extracellular release33. 
Serum levels of CK18 fragments and total length 
CK18 can be measured by an M30 and M65 anti￾body enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), 
with M30 levels correlating with liver inflammation 
and ballooning in patients with NAFLD and parallel 
histological improvement over time34. Nevertheless, 
there is considerable overlap of CK18 levels between 
patients with and without NASH; a meta-analysis of 
11 studies found a pooled sensitivity and specificity 
for NASH of 66% and 82%, respectively, suggesting 
that it is not sufficiently accurate for clinical use35. To 
increase diagnostic utility, CK18 has been combined 
with serum levels of apoptosis-mediating surface anti￾gen FAS (sFAS), which is involved in the activation 
of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway in hepatocytes36. 
A small study demonstrated that the combination 
of M30 and sFAS levels had reasonable to excellent 
accuracy (AUROC of 0.79–0.93); however, further 
validation studies are required36.
Inflammation is one of the histological hallmarks of 
NASH, and thus serum levels of many inflammatory 
markers and mediators, including C-reactive protein 
(CRP), TNF, IL-6 and IL-8, IL-1 receptor antagonist 
protein (IL-1RA) and CXC-chemokine 10 (CXCL10), 
have been examined as diagnostic markers. As NASH 
is associated with an underlying inflammatory meta￾bolic state, these markers might not be specific for liver 
inflammation. Notably, a study of 648 patients with 
biopsy-proven NAFLD that tested the diagnostic utility 
of 32 plasma biomarkers, including many inflamma￾tory markers, found that levels of IL-8, soluble IL-1R 
type 1 (IL-1R1), total plasminogen activator inhibitor 
1 (PAI1) and activated PAI1 (aPAI1) were associated 
with NASH. However, only aPAI1 remained predictive 
of NASH after adjustment for clinical and metabolic 
factors37. aPAI1 is an inhibitor of fibrinolysis and might

link NASH with increased cardiovascular risk through 
its effect on coagulation. aPAI1 is unlikely to be suffi￾ciently diagnostic in isolation, and further studies 
examining its diagnostic utility in combination with 
other markers are awaited.
Oxidative stress is one of the principal pathogenic 
mechanisms of liver injury in NASH and leads to lipid 
oxidation and the generation of serum products that 
can be measured38. Lipidomic studies utilizing mass 
spectroscopy have found lipid oxidation products to be 
associated with NASH, including products of arachi￾donic acid oxidation (11-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid 
(11-HETE)) and products of linoleic acid oxidation 
(9 and 13 hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE) and 
9 and 13 oxo-octadecadienoic acids (oxo-ODE))39,40. 
The combination of linoleic acid:13-HODE ratio plus 
age, BMI and AST forms the oxNASH score, which 
has been validated as providing reasonable diag￾nostic accuracy for NASH (AUROC 0.74–0.83)40. 
Nevertheless, the cost of and need for specialized 
equipment and specimen processing currently limit 
widespread application of lipid oxidation products as 
a diagnostic tool for NASH.
A range of hormones involved in lipid and glucose 
metabolism are disturbed in NASH, including adipo￾kines (adiponectin, leptin, resistin, visfatin (also known 
as NAMPT), retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) and 
fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4)) and liver-derived 
hormones, including fibroblast growth factor 21 
(FGF21)41. These hormones might be involved in the 
pathogenesis of liver injury; however, serum levels 
could also reflect associated metabolic abnormali￾ties such as visceral adiposity and thus might not be 
specific for NASH. Consequently, there are conflict￾ing studies regarding the independent association 
between adipokines and NASH37,42,43. By contrast, a 
meta-analysis published in 2017 demonstrated a con￾sistent association between serum FGF21 levels and 
NASH. However, this biomarker was only modestly 
sensitive and specific, with pooled values of 62% and 
78%, respectively44.
Ferritin is an acute-phase reactant that is commonly 
increased in patients with NAFLD and metabolic syn￾drome. Previous studies have shown an association

panel of serum ferritin, fasting insulin and type IV 
collagen 7S achieved an AUROC of 0.78 for the diagnosis 
of NASH38.
Biomarker panels. Owing to the modest accuracy of 
individual markers of NASH, combinations of markers 
have been examined to increase diagnostic utility. The 
NASHTest (Biopredictive) is a proprietary algorithm 
consisting of a combination of age, gender, height, 
weight and serum levels of triglyceride, cholesterol, 
α2m, apolipoprotein AI, haptoglobin, GGT, ALT, AST 
and total bilirubin48. The accuracy of the NASHTest in 
training and validation cohorts totalling 257 patients 
was between 0.69 and 0.79. Other combination panels 
have frequently included CK18 quantification; Younossi 
and colleagues examined the levels of a combination of 
cleaved and intact CK18, adiponectin and resistin in 
101 patients and found AUROC values between 0.73 
and 0.91 for the diagnosis of NASH. They subsequently 
developed the NASH Diagnostic Panel (comprising 
diabetes mellitus presence, sex, BMI and serum levels 
of triglyceride, CK18 fragments and total CK18), which 
could diagnose NASH with an AUROC of 0.81 (ref.
49). 
Both these panels were developed in somewhat small 
numbers of patients with obesity, and thus further val￾idation is required. Another panel utilizing the combi￾nation of serum CK18 and FGF21 levels in a step-wise 
approach found high specificity and sensitivity values 
of>90% for NASH when applying optimal cut-off val￾ues, but this was at the cost of indeterminate values in 
~70% of patients42. Plasma levels of cathepsin D (CTSD; 
a lysosomal enzyme) were found to have an accuracy of 
0.998 for the prediction of NASH in a paediatric popu￾lation when combined with plasma CK18 levels50. A sub￾sequent study in adults found that serum CTSD levels in 
isolation had 84% accuracy for NASH; levels of CTSD 
fell substantially after weight loss surgery, suggesting 
that this marker is dynamic to treatment51. Confusingly, 
however, CTSD levels were high in adult patients with 
NASH but low in paediatric patients, underscoring the 
need for further validation.
Despite the large number of serum biomarkers and 
combination panels in the literature, there is a lack of 
independent validation, particularly in different ethnic 
groups or in non-bariatric surgery populations. Similarly, 
there is uncertainty regarding the optimum diagnostic 
cut-offs and a lack of knowledge regarding the influence 
of other factors that might affect test interpretation. Apart 
from CK18, there is limited assessment of the dynamic 
nature of biomarkers to determine whether they reflect 
changes in histology over time and thus can be used 
to monitor disease progression or treatment efficacy. 
Lastly, a NASH biomarker should demonstrate cost￾effectiveness and directly influence patient management 
before widespread adoption into clinical practice.
Imaging biomarkers
Routine imaging by abdominal ultrasonography, CT 
or MRI is unable to distinguish between NAFL and 
NASH. A number of MRI-based techniques have been 
tried in animal and pilot human studies for the diagno￾sis of NASH. Super paramagnetic iron oxide MRI can 
detect Kupffer cell uptake function, which is impaired 
in animals and humans with NASH, but the current 
protocol requires repeated scanning over 72h and thus 
poses logistical difficulties52. When the hepatobiliary 
contrast gadoxetic acid is used, patients with NASH 
have increased liver enhancement on MRI53. Hepatocyte 
membrane turnover and intracellular ATP can be meas￾ured by phosphorus MRS and are altered in patients with 
NASH54. In particular, the alpha-nucleotide triphos￾phate:total phosphate ratio had an AUROC of 0.71 for 
diagnosing NASH. Liver stiffness measurement by mag￾netic resonance elastography (MRE, described in detail 
in the diagnosis of fibrosis and cirrhosis section) is also 
increased in NASH, but the diagnostic accuracy needs 
to be evaluated in larger cohorts with careful adjustment 
for fibrosis stage55.
Summary and recommendations
CK18 is the most extensively evaluated test for NASH 
diagnosis, but overall accuracy is moderate at best. 
Although other biomarkers or panels might hold prom￾ise, most have not been independently validated. At pres￾ent, none of the NASH biomarkers are ready for routine 
clinical use. However, active research in this field will 
further inform practice. The use of different NASH bio￾markers in clinical trials depends on the mechanism of 
action of the study drugs. For example, cell death mark￾ers might be more relevant for agents targeting hepato￾cyte apoptosis56. Biomarkers well suited for assessing 
metabolic changes, apoptosis or cell death, inflammation 
or fibrogenesis are therefore of greatest relevance.
Diagnosis of fibrosis and cirrhosis
Cirrhosis is the final common pathway of chronic liver 
diseases. Once cirrhosis sets in, a patient is at risk of devel￾oping portal hypertension, liver decompensation and 
HCC57. A meta-analysis published in 2017 further con￾firms that fibrosis stage is associated with all-cause mor￾tality in a dose-dependent manner, with increased risk 
first apparent in patients with F2 fibrosis58. Because of the 
close association between fibrosis stage and clinical out￾comes, one can argue that effective treatments for NASH 
must improve fibrosis or at least prevent its progression.
Non-proprietary biomarkers and panels
Most non-proprietary biomarkers of fibrosis do not 
directly measure fibrogenesis or fibrinolysis. They often 
represent biological processes associated with risk factors 
of fibrosis and are commonly performed and inexpensive. 
However, such indirect biomarkers are in general less 
accurate than biomarkers directly measuring fibrogenesis 
or fibrinolysis. To compensate for the reduced accuracy, 
most investigators use a panel of biomarkers (Table 3). 
On the whole, although these panels have modest accu￾racy, many have negative predictive values of over 90% 
in excluding advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis at the pro￾posed cut-offs. They are, however, less reliable than other 
methods in discriminating among fibrosis stages.
The AST:ALT ratio and AST:platelet ratio index 
(APRI) were initially derived from chronic hepatitis 
C cohorts59,60. They are simple to calculate but have 
low accuracy in diagnosing advanced fibrosis and

cirrhosis in patients with NAFLD (AUROC 0.66–0.74 
and AUROC 0.74 for the discrimination of F3 fibrosis, 
respectively). The Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index comprises 
age, AST, ALT and platelet count and is calculated with 
a more complicated formula; it has moderate accu￾racy (AUROC 0.83 for detecting F3 fibrosis), which is 
comparable to that of the NAFLD fibrosis score61.
The NAFLD fibrosis score was specifically derived 
and validated in patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD62. 
The formula consists of age, BMI, presence of impaired 
fasting glucose or diabetes mellitus, AST:ALT ratio, plate￾let count and serum albumin levels. It has an AUROC of 
0.82 in detecting F3 fibrosis and has been more exten￾sively validated than the other scores63. Importantly, the 
score has been shown to predict liver decompensation 
and mortality in patients with NAFLD64.
The BARD score (calculated from BMI, AST:ALT 
ratio and diabetes mellitus presence) was also derived 
from a large American NAFLD cohort; it has mod￾erate accuracy in detecting F3 fibrosis in subsequent 
validation studies (AUROC 0.69–0.81)65.
Although these scores are less accurate than spe￾cific fibrosis markers, they have high applicability, as 
the components are all readily available to clinicians. 
Although some scores require complex calculations, 
the availability of online calculators and corresponding 
apps has rendered this hurdle less relevant. Besides, these 
scores have high negative predictive value in excluding 
advanced fibrosis and liver-related events and are there￾fore reasonable screening tools particularly when more 
sophisticated tests are unavailable66.
Specific fibrosis markers
Specific fibrosis markers reflect fibrogenesis and/or 
fibrinolysis. Although there is overlap in values across 
fibrosis stages, some proprietary panels (such as 
FibroTest and FibroMeter) provide the exact predicted 
fibrosis stage in the report. Liver fibrosis devel￾ops through the hepatic deposition of extracellular 
matrix (ECM), of which hyaluronic acid (HA), a non￾proteoglycan polysaccharide, is a major component67
(Table  4). When used alone, serum HA level has 
an AUROC of 0.87 for F2 fibrosis and 0.92 for cir￾rhosis68. Other major components of the ECM include 
proteoglycans (such as heparan sulfate, chondroitin sul￾fate and keratan sulfate), collagen, elastin, fibronectin 
and laminin. Procollagen III amino-terminal peptide 
(PIIINP) in the serum is derived from the synthesis of 
new type III collagen or from the degradation of exist￾ing type III collagen fibrils; PIIINP levels alone are not 
a good diagnostic marker for liver fibrosis in NAFLD 
or alcoholic liver disease69. A neo-epitope-specific 
competitive ELISA for PIIINP, that is, Pro-C3, reflects 
true formation of type III collagen, as it measures the 
propeptide cleaved off from the intact collagen mol￾ecule and is specific for liver collagen70. Raised serum 
Pro-C3 levels correlate with key components of NASH 
and fibrosis71.
Circulating levels of tissue inhibitor of metallo￾proteinases 1 (TIMP1), which regulates matrix 
metalloproteinases and is responsible for the ECM 
composition and wound healing, reflect alterations in 
tissue matrix remodelling during hepatic fibrogenesis 
and fibrinolysis72. TIMP1 has excellent diagnostic 
accuracy (AUROC 0.97) to differentiate patients 
who are obese and have NASH from age-matched 
healthy control individuals73. Laminin is the most 
abundant non-collagenous glycoprotein in basement 
membranes. Serum laminin level is able to diagnose 
fibrosis in patients with NAFLD to a satisfactory level 
of accuracy (AUROC 0.87)74. Although the biomarkers 
discussed in this section are promising, their cost and 
availability have limited their adoption in routine 
practice.

The Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) panel is an 
algorithm consisting of three specific fibrosis markers 
discussed above: PIIINP, HA and TIMP1 (ref.
75). ELF 
was found to be accurate to predict advanced fibrosis 
in adult and paediatric patients with NAFLD (AUROC 
0.93 and 0.99, respectively)76,77. FibroTest (Biopredictive; 
or known as Fibrosure in the United States) consists of 
five components: serum levels of GGT, total bilirubin, 
α2m, apolipoprotein AI and haptoglobin78. FibroTest 
was found to be better than BARD and FIB-4 at pre￾dicting fibrosis in patients with NAFLD (AUROC 0.88 
for any fibrosis)79. FibroMeter NAFLD (Echosens, 
Paris, France) is an index composed of body weight, 
prothrombin index and serum levels of ALT, AST, 
ferritin and fasting glucose. In two studies conducted 
in Europe and Asia, FibroMeter NAFLD outperformed 
other serum tests for the diagnosis of fibrosis80,81. The 
FibroMeter vibration-controlled transient elastography 
algorithm (combining FibroMeter NAFLD and liver 
stiffness measurement) might improve the diagnosis of 
F3–F4 fibrosis versus F0–F2 fibrosis81. Hepascore, com￾posed of age, sex and serum levels of bilirubin, GGT, 
HA and α2m, has similarly satisfactory accuracy as other 
serum formulae (AUROC 0.82) to diagnose advanced 
fibrosis (stage F3–F4) in patients with NAFLD82.
Despite slight improvement in diagnostic accu￾racy over non-proprietary biomarkers, the limited 
availability of these specific fibrosis markers and the 
cost of using proprietary formulae might limit their 
wider application.

Imaging biomarkers
FibroScan. FibroScan measures the velocity of an elas￾tic shear wave propagating through the liver29 (Fig. 2; 
Table 5). This velocity is directly related to tissue stiff￾ness, which in turn is related to the degree of fibrosis; 
the stiffer the tissue, the faster the shear wave propagates. 
The measurement procedure is considered to have failed 
when no value is obtained after ten attempts. An exam￾ination is considered valid if ≥10 valid measurements 
are obtained and the interquartile range (which reflects 
the variability of measurements) is<30% of the median 
liver stiffness measurement. The results are expressed in 
kilopascals and range from 1.5 to 75 kPa, with normal 
values near 5 kPa. The summary AUROC values using 
FibroScan M and XL probes for diagnosing advanced 
fibrosis are 0.88 and 0.85, respectively83.The XL probe 
was designed to cater to patients who are obese and 
produces similar diagnostic accuracy as the M probe in 
patients who are not obese84,85.
Although FibroScan has excellent negative predic￾tive value to exclude advanced fibrosis, its positive pre￾dictive value to rule in advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis is 
modest (Table 3). As such, a number of studies have tried 
to combine FibroScan and a non-proprietary formula 
such as the NAFLD fibrosis score to improve the diag￾nostic accuracy86–88. Potential applications of combined 
tests include performing both tests and considering the 
diagnosis confirmed if they provide concordant results 
and reserving the second test for when results from the 
first test are inconclusive. In most situations, the second 
approach is more attractive because FibroScan already has 
a high negative predictive value; a second test will add 
little information for patients with low liver stiffness.
Point shear wave elastography. Point shear wave elasto￾graphy (pSWE), also known as acoustic radiation force 
impulse (ARFI), involves mechanical excitation of tis￾sue using short-duration acoustic pulses that propagate 
shear waves and generate localized, micrometre-scale 
displacements in tissue89 (Fig. 2). The exact location 
where measurements are obtained can be selected by 
the operator. A major advantage of pSWE is that it can 
be easily implemented on modified commercial ultra￾sonography machines. Therefore, liver fibrosis and 
the liver parenchyma can be assessed during the same 
examination. Values obtained with pSWE are expressed 
in m/s and have a narrow range (0.5–4.4 m/s), which 
limits the definitions of cut-off values for discriminating 
certain fibrosis stages and thus for making management 
decisions. For instance, pSWE performance is better for 
severe fibrosis and cirrhosis than for less severe fibrosis90. 
However, pSWE has not been extensively evaluated, and 
studies are needed to determine the effects of the narrow 
measurement range and discrepancies between right and 
left liver lobe readings.
2D shear wave elastography. 2D shear wave elastography 
(2D-SWE) is based on the combination of a radiation 
force induced in tissues by focused ultrasonic beams 
and a very high frame rate ultrasonography imaging 
sequence capable of catching in real time the transient 
propagation of resulting shear waves91 (Fig. 2). The size 
of the region of interest can be chosen by the operator. 
2D-SWE also has the advantage of being implemented 
on a commercially available ultrasonography machine, 
with results expressed either in m/s or in kilopascals 
across a wide range of values (2–150 kPa)90. 2D-SWE 
has a higher accuracy than pSWE for diagnosis of F2 
fibrosis (AUROC 0.85–0.92 versus AUROC 0.70–0.83).
Magnetic resonance elastography. MRE uses a modified 
phase-contrast method to image the propagation of the 
shear wave in the liver parenchyma. It can assess the 
entire liver, irrespective of body habitus, and mechanical 
parameters for shear stiffness have been standardized92. 
A meta-analysis of nine studies comprising 232 patients 
with NAFLD found that MRE detected fibrosis with a 
high level of accuracy, independent of liver inflamma￾tion and BMI (unlike FibroScan), with AUROC values 
of 0.86–0.91 for all stages of fibrosis93. This technique 
is more accurate than FibroScan in detecting F2 fibro￾sis (AUROC 0.86–0.89 versus AUROC 0.84) and F4 
fibrosis (AUROC 0.88–0.97 versus AUROC 0.95)27,94. 
However, its wider application is limited by cost and 
availability. In particular, these drawbacks make it 
unlikely that MRE can be applied as a screening test.
Multiparametric MRI. In the past few years, a multipara￾metric magnetic resonance technique (LiverMultiScan, 
Perspectum Diagnostics, Oxford, UK) has been estab￾lished that includes T1 mapping for fibrosis and 
inflammation imaging, T2 mapping for liver iron

Shear wave elastography (part b) and acoustic radiation force impulse (part c) are 
incorporated in an ultrasonography machine and thus can be performed together with

quantification and 1
H-MRS for liver fat quantifi￾cation95. The T1 measurements are adjusted for the 
iron level, as high iron levels in the presence of fibrosis 
can lead to ‘pseudo-normal’ T1 values. LiverMultiScan 
is a quick and noninvasive test that does not require 
injection of any intravenous contrast agent. In a study 
published in 2017, the AUROC using liver inflamma￾tion and fibrosis for the diagnosis of NAFLD-related 
cirrhosis was 0.85 (ref.
96). Further validation studies 
are needed.
Summary and recommendations
For equipped centres, ultrasound-based elastography 
such as FibroScan and shear wave elastography has 
moderate to high accuracy in diagnosing advanced 
fibrosis or cirrhosis and can be used in routine clinical 
practice (Table 5). MRE has a higher success rate and 
accuracy than ultrasound-based technologies but is lim￾ited by cost and availability. However, it can be used in 
clinical trials to identify drugs with potential antifibrotic 
effects. If the imaging methods detailed are unavail￾able, blood biomarkers and clinical prediction rules are 
reasonable alternatives to rule out advanced fibrosis, 
although they are less accurate in discriminating across 
fibrosis stages.
Genetic biomarkers
Over the past few years, knowledge of the genetic 
component of NAFLD has grown exponentially, in 
part owing to genome-wide association studies and 
the advent of high-throughput omics technologies. 
The newly acquired genetic information has helped 
improve the understanding of disease pathogenesis, ena￾bling novel strategies for early identification of at-risk 
patients to be envisioned. Nevertheless, incorporation 
of NAFLD genetic markers into routine clinical testing 
that can be used to dynamically assess the disease status 
and response to therapy has been slow, and the informa￾tion yielded has had moderate utility. Here, we provide 
a critical appraisal of genetic and genomic markers in

the assessment of NAFLD and NASH risk and severity 
(Table 6) and their roles in the dynamic assessment of 
intervention response (Table 7).
Genetic markers — specifically DNA sequence 
variation, including single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) — that are present at birth might be valuable 
for the identification of individuals at risk of NAFLD 
or NASH in large screening programmes. To date, 
three genetic variants have been identified (rs738409, 
rs58542926 and rs780094), located in PNPLA3, TM6SF2
and GCKR, respectively, that have consistently shown an 
effect on the phenotypic variance of NAFLD and histo￾logical outcomes. The risk effect of the common missense 
SNP rs738409 (minor allele frequency (MAF; the fre￾quency at which the second most common allele occurs 
in a population) 0.38) is the strongest SNP reported for 
a genetic modifier of NAFLD. However, it accounts 
for only ~5.3% of the total variance and a moderate odds 
ratio (~3.3) of NAFLD and NASH97. The low-frequency 
missense SNP rs58542926 (MAF 0.07) and the intronic 
SNP rs780094 (MAF 0.30) variants are both associ￾ated with a very modest risk (approximately 2-fold98
and 1.2-fold99, respectively) of developing NAFLD. It is 
then not surprising that the diagnostic and prognostic 
performance of detecting NAFLD and/or discriminat￾ing between NAFL and NASH are not improved by the 
incorporation of genetic variants into the biomarker 
agenda compared with the incorporation of non-genetic 
markers20,100–102 (Table 7). In fact, although their inclusion 
alongside routine clinical parameters results in a reason￾able ability to predict the presence of the disease and 
the probability of progression, accuracy is comparable 
to that of existing biomarker scores that combine clini￾cal and routine laboratory variables20,100–102. Conversely, 
available evidence indicates that rs738409 might assist 
in the identification of patients who are more likely to 
have reduced liver fat levels after lifestyle intervention or 
bariatric surgery103,104 (Table 7).
Genomic information derived from transcrip￾tomics that includes expression of non-coding RNAs, 
specifically microRNAs (miRNAs), probably improves 
robustness in discriminating patients with NAFLD 
who are at risk of developing advanced disease, as they 
provide precious information on molecular signatures 
associated with an aggressive phenotype, for instance, 
liver inflammation and fibrosis. In addition, non-coding 
RNAs produced by the affected tissue can be targeted, 
which is the hallmark of an ideal biomarker for assessing 
dynamic changes (the course of the disease). Assessment 
of cell-free RNA or cell-free DNA (cfDNA), which are 
nucleic acid molecules that circulate in serum or plasma, 
is particularly noteworthy. In the context of liver diseases, 
miR-122 has been extensively studied for this liquid 
biopsy approach and has been shown to be valuable in 
predicting the presence of NASH105–107 (Table 6). In one 
study, miR-122 had an AUROC of 0.71 for diagnosing

NASH and 0.61 for fibrosis86. Overall, because miRNAs 
in the circulating compartment are very stable, their 
detection in plasma or serum has resulted in a highly 
reproducible and consistent surrogate of liver injury and 
damage in patients with different liver diseases105–108. 
Likewise, cfDNA, particularly methylated DNA, has 
opened new avenues in the biomarker discovery of liver 
fibrosis109 (Table 6). Nevertheless, many analytical and 
technical challenges lie ahead — for instance, cfDNA cir￾culates fragmented and at very low concentration, and 
methylated DNA requires bisulfite treatment — before 
it can be utilized in clinical contexts.
New omic markers
The development of omics technologies has allowed a 
hypothesis-free approach to identify novel biomarkers 
of NAFLD, NASH and fibrosis. To date, findings have 
mainly been exploratory and cross-sectional with a lack 
of validation studies. In addition, the complicated method￾ology involved in omics platforms also prevents widespread 
application beyond the research setting. Nevertheless, 
the studies outlined in this section detail a number of 
promising diagnostic biomarkers for NAFLD and NASH.
Lipidomics is a logical strategy to pursue in NAFLD, 
with targeted and untargeted approaches identifying 
substantial alterations in multiple plasma lipid species 
and eicosanoids across the spectrum of NAFLD39,40,110,111. 
A large study of 679 patients who underwent liver biopsy 
or MRS discovered and validated a signature compris￾ing three lipid molecules that was modestly accurate 
(AUROC 0.71–74) at predicting NAFLD112. Similar 
smaller studies have found circulating oxidized fatty 
acids and products of arachidonic acid metabolism to 
be predictive of NASH; however, these findings require 
larger confirmatory validation studies39,40,111.
Small studies involving proteomic approaches have 
highlighted increases in serum gamma-glutamyl dipep￾tides in NASH, which are involved in metabolism of 
glutathione, a key antioxidant in the liver113,114. A large 
study of 318 patients who underwent liver biopsy used a 
combination of genetic, clinical, lipidomic and metabo￾lomics approaches to derive the NASH ClinLipMet 
score, which could identify patients with NASH with 
an accuracy (AUROC) of 0.86–0.88 and was not 
affected by statin medications or degree of obesity101. 
The complexity and laboratory expertise required to 
calculate the score currently limit widespread utili￾zation. Notably, the metabolomics alterations in this 
study included changes in circulating levels of branch 
chain and essential amino acids, including glutamate

and serine. These amino acids had previously been 
identified as potential biomarkers of NASH by an in 
silico study using a systems biology approach based on 
a genome-scale metabolic hepatocyte model115.
Metabolomics has also been used to differentiate 
metabolic subtypes of human NAFLD on the basis 
of metabolite profiles observed in a genetic animal 
model of NASH with decreased hepatic levels of 
S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe)116. The authors suggest 
that metabolite profiling can identify a subtype of 
NAFLD that responds to SAMe supplementation, 
thereby suggesting that a biomarker can be used in the 
future to stratify treatment approaches.
New omics technology has led to an explosion of 
interest in the microbiome and the profiling of gut 
microbiota and metabolites that associate with NAFLD, 
NASH and fibrosis117–120. Although findings have been 
mixed, alterations in the phyla Firmicutes (reduced) and 
Proteobacteria (increased) and reduced Ruminococcus
at both the genus and species level have been associated 
with NASH and fibrosis in several studies in humans119,120. 
Meta-genomic sequencing of stool microbiota from 
86 individuals with NAFLD identified 37 species associated 
with advanced fibrosis, enabling the development of an 
algorithm that could predict advanced fibrosis with a high 
degree of accuracy (AUROC 0.936)120. Subsequent iden￾tification of serum metabolites predicted by gut bacterial 
functional analysis found differential levels of 11 amino 
acids and metabolites involved in nucleoside and carbon 
metabolism, suggesting that a serum test based on gut 
microbiome profiles will be a useful marker in the future.
Last, analysis of volatile organic compounds, or 
‘volatilomics’, in stool and breath has demonstrated 
discrete differences in profiles in patients with NAFLD 
and NASH117,121. These studies have been relatively small 
(<100 patients), and the accuracy for distinguishing 
NASH and non-NASH is modest (AUROC 0.77)121. 
Although these studies relied upon mass spectrometry 
of breath samples, an interesting study published in 2016 
utilized a portable gas-sensor array (an ‘electronic nose’) 
to determine the breath-print associated with liver cir￾rhosis among patients with chronic liver disease from 
a variety of aetiologies, raising the possibility that this 
technology might be able to distinguish different stages 
of NAFLD122.
Conclusions
The past decade has seen major developments in non￾invasive assessments for NAFLD and NASH. For routine 
clinical practice, abdominal ultrasonography remains the 
primary test to diagnose fatty liver because of its wide 
availability and relatively low cost (Fig. 3). Serum formu￾lae have limited accuracy for individual patients but can 
be easily applied in large epidemiological studies. CAP

and liver stiffness measurement by vibration-controlled 
transient elastography enable simultaneous assessment 
of liver fat and fibrosis, and the criteria for valid results 
are well defined123,124. This approach can be used as initial 
assessment of patients at high risk in centres where the 
equipment is available. However, longitudinal studies are 
needed to define how well serial measurements reflect 
disease progression and treatment response. MRI-PDFF 
and MRE are superior to transient elastography and other 
noninvasive tests of steatosis and fibrosis and have already 
been applied in early-phase NASH trials. Cost and availa￾bility will be the main hurdles for their wider application.
Compared with noninvasive tests for hepatic steatosis 
and fibrosis, the development of NASH biomarkers has 
lagged behind, in part owing to the complex biology and 
dynamic activity of NASH. Nonetheless, with obeticholic 
acid, elafibranor, selonsertib and cenicriviroc entering 
phase III development, the development of a noninva￾sive NASH biomarker to select patients for treatment 
and monitor treatment response will be a pressing need. 
Obviously, when the drugs are used in the wider com￾munity, it is unrealistic to perform serial liver biopsies on 
all treated patients. Fortunately, these large clinical trials 
with long-term follow-up offer a unique opportunity for 
biomarker discovery and validation. Genetic studies and 
an omics approach have also shed light on the patho￾physiology of NASH and have provided a number of 
potential biomarkers for further evaluation.
