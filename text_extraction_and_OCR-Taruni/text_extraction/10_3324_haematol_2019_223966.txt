ARTICLE FIGURES AND DATA INFO AND METRICS
Abstract
Patients with inherited thrombocytopenias often require platelet
transfusions to raise their platelet count before surgery or other
invasive procedures; moreover, subjects with clinically significant
spontaneous bleeding may benefit from an enduring improvement
of thrombocytopenia. The hypothesis that thrombopoietin-mimetics
can increase platelet count in inherited thrombocytopenias is
appealing, but evidence is scarce. We conducted a prospective,
phase II clinical trial to investigate the efficacy of the oral
thrombopoietin-mimetic eltrombopag in different forms of inherited
thrombocytopenia. We enrolled 24 patients affected by MYH9-
related disease, ANKRD26-related thrombocytopenia, X-linked
thrombocytopenia/ Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, monoallelic Bernard-
Soulier syndrome, or ITGB3-related thrombocytopenia. The average
pre-treatment platelet count was 40.4 ×109/L. Patients received a
3- to 6-week course of eltrombopag in a dose-escalated manner. Of
23 patients evaluable for response, 11 (47.8%) achieved a major
response (platelet count >100 ×109/L), ten (43.5%) had a minor
response (platelet count at least twice the baseline value), and two
patients (8.7%) did not respond. The average increase of platelet
count compared to baseline was 64.5 ×109/L (P<0.001). Four
patients with clinically significant spontaneous bleeding entered a
program of long-term eltrombopag administration (16 additional
weeks): all of them obtained remission of mucosal hemorrhages,
with the remission persisting throughout the treatment period.
Treatment was globally well tolerated: five patients reported mild
adverse events and one patient a moderate adverse event. In


conclusion, eltrombopag was safe and effective in increasing
platelet count and reducing bleeding symptoms in different forms of
inherited thrombocytopenia. Despite these encouraging results,
caution is recommended when using thrombopoietinmimetics in
inherited thrombocytopenias predisposing to leukemia.
ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02422394.
Introduction
Inherited thrombocytopenias are a heterogeneous group of
disorders characterized by a reduced number of blood platelets
which can result in a bleeding tendency of variable severity.
Although inherited thrombocytopenias are rare, recent
improvements in the knowledge of these conditions have indicated
that, taken together, their prevalence is higher than previously
thought. In fact, based on a registry of patients with
thrombocytopenia, the prevalence of inherited thrombocytopenias
in the Italian population is estimated to be 2.7 cases per 100,000
population.1
Most patients with an inherited thrombocytopenia have mild or no
spontaneous bleeding: however, even patients who do not have
spontaneous hemorrhages often require platelet transfusions prior
to surgery or other invasive procedures because their platelet count
is below the safe threshold for the specific procedure.51 Platelet
transfusions have several drawbacks, as they expose patients to the
risk of acute reactions, transmission of infectious diseases, and
alloimmunization with consequent refractoriness to subsequent
platelet transfusions.763 The last is a particularly critical event in
these patients with lifelong thrombocytopenia. Moreover, the
availability of platelet units is conditioned by the scarceness of
blood donors. Less commonly, some patients with inherited
thrombocytopenias have frequent episodes of spontaneous bleeding
that affect their quality of life, expose them to the risk of major
hemorrhages, and may require frequent hospitalization and/or
transfusions. In these subjects, obtaining an enduring increase of
platelet count sufficient to stably abolish or reduce spontaneous
hemorrhages would be a major achievement.
Thrombopoietin-receptor agonists (TPO-RA) are targeted agents


that can stimulate megakaryopoiesis and platelet production
through the activation of the thrombopoietin receptor, MPL. These
drugs are currently approved for the treatment of a few forms of
acquired thrombocytopenia.8 Although the hypothesis that TPO-RA
can increase platelet count also in patients with inherited
thrombocy-topenias is appealing, the evidence on this topic is very
scarce, mainly because of the difficulties in carrying out clinical
trials in these orphan diseases. In fact, only one prospective study
has been conducted so far: moreover, this study enrolled patients
affected with only one of the many forms of inherited
thrombocytopenia. In this trial, a short course of the oral TPO-RA
eltrombopag was given to 12 patients with thrombocytopenia
deriving from mutations in MYH9 (i.e., MYH9-related disease,
MYH9-RD): 11 patients showed an increase of platelet count.9
Based on these results, there are anecdotal reports of short-term
eltrombopag treatment to prepare MYH9-RD patients for major
surgery.1210 The remaining available clinical information on the
effects of TPO-RA in inherited thrombocytopenias derives from
single case reports1713 and the retrospective investigation of one
small case series.18
Here we report the results of the second prospective clinical trial on
the use of TPO-RA in genetic thrombocytopenias. We investigated
the efficacy of eltrombopag in increasing platelet count in patients
affected by different forms of inherited thrombocytopenia. Patients
received short-term eltrombopag to test whether this treatment can
raise platelet count up to safe levels for major surgery. Moreover, in
those patients with clinically significant spontaneous bleeding, we
also investigated whether prolonged administration of eltrombopag
could induce a persistent remission of the spontaneous
hemorrhages.
Methods
Patients
Patients were enrolled at five Italian centers (Online Supplementary
Table S1). The study protocol was approved by the institutional
review boards of all centers. Patients or their legal guardians signed


written informed consent to participation in the study, which was
conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Inclusion and
exclusion criteria for this trial are detailed in the Online
Supplementary Methods.
Study design
This was a phase II, open-label, dose-escalation trial. The study
consisted of two parts.
The main aim of part 1 was to test whether, and in which forms of
inherited thrombocytopenia, a short-term course of eltrombopag is
effective in increasing platelet count above the safe threshold for all
types of surgery (100×10/L).54 All patients eligible for the study
entered part 1. Patients received eltrombopag 50 mg/day for 3
weeks. Patients who obtained a platelet count >100 ×10/L by day
21 stopped treatment (as they had achieved the primary endpoint).
In the other cases, patients received eltrombopag 75 mg/day for 3
additional weeks.
The main aim of part 2 of the study was to test the efficacy of long-
term eltrombopag in achieving an enduring remission of bleeding
symptoms in patients with clinically significant spontaneous
hemorrhages. Criteria for entering part 2 were the following:
patients with spontaneous bleeding at baseline grade ≥2 according
to the World Health Organization (WHO) bleeding scale, who
completed part 1 without severe side effects and obtained a
reduction of bleeding symptoms at the end of part 1. Part 2
consisted of 16 weeks of treatment. Patients were started on
eltrombopag 25 mg/day and then re-evaluated every 4 weeks: the
eltrombopag dose was adjusted based on bleeding tendency and
platelet count according to the schedule reported in Online
Supplementary Figure S1.
Endpoints and outcome measures
The primary endpoint of part 1 was the achievement of a platelet
count >100×10/L, i.e., a safe level for all types of surgery
according to current guidelines.54 Major response was defined as
the achievement of the primary endpoint. Minor response was


defined as the achievement of a platelet count at least two-fold
higher than baseline without reaching the criteria for major
response.
The primary endpoint of part 2 was the stable reduction of
spontaneous bleeding manifestations according to the WHO
bleeding scale during the last 2 weeks of treatment. A major
response was defined as a complete remission of hemorrhages. A
minor response was defined as a reduction of bleeding according to
the WHO bleeding scale without reaching the criteria for a major
response.
Secondary endpoints included safety and tolerability of the
treatments; dosages of eltrombopag required to achieve the primary
endpoints; and improvement of health-related quality of life (HR-
QoL) with long-term eltrombopag administration (part 2 only).
Exploratory endpoints included the effects of treatment on serum
thrombopoietin levels and on platelet function investigated by light
transmission aggregometry and/or flow cytometry.
Investigation of patients
Studies performed to investigate patients at baseline and at each
subsequent visit are detailed in the Online Supplementary Methods.
Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis was performed as described in the Online
Supplementary Methods.
Results
Study population
Twenty-four patients were enrolled between April 2015 and May
2017. They consisted of nine patients with MYH9-RD; nine with
ANKRD26-related thrombocytopenia (ANKRD26-RT);19 three with
thrombocytopenia caused by WAS mutations (2 with X-linked


thrombocytopenia, XLT, and 1 with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome,
WAS);2120 two with monoallelic Bernard-Soulier syndrome (mBSS)
caused by the Ala156Val mutation of GPIbα;22 and one with
thrombocytopenia deriving from an ITGB3 mutation (ITGB3-RT).23
The patients’ mean platelet count was 40.4×10/L. Table 1 and
Online Supplementary Table S4 describe the features of the study
population at baseline.

Table 1.Main features of the study population at baseline.
Part 1 of the study
Twenty-three patients completed part 1 of the study, whereas one
patient with ANKRD26-RT discontinued treatment early because of
an adverse event (see below).
Responses in part 1 of the study are summarized in Table 2 and
detailed in Online Supplementary Tables S5 and S6. Twenty-one of
the 23 evaluable patients [91.3%, 95% confidence interval (95%
CI): 72.0-98.9] obtained a response according to the study criteria:
11 patients (47.8%) achieved a major response and ten (43.5%) a
minor response. Two patients (8.7%) did not respond (one with
ANKRD26-RT and the patient with ITGB3-RT). Most patients with
MYH9-RD and the two subjects with mBSS obtained a major
response, whereas most patients with ANKRD26-RT and the three
subjects with XLT/WAS achieved a minor response (Table 2).
[image]
Table 2.Responses in part 1 of the study (primary endpoint), overall
and according to the different forms of inherited thrombocytopenia.
The mean platelet count at the end of part 1 of the study was
104.9×10/L (P<0.001 compared to baseline). The mean increase
in platelet count with respect to baseline was 64.5×10/L (95% CI:
43.7-85.3) overall, and 69.5×10/L in the 21 responders. Table 2
and Figure 1 report the average increase in platelet count in the


responders according to the different forms of inherited
thrombocytopenia.

part 1 of the study. Patients are categorized according to the
diagnosis of the specific form of inherited thrombocytopenia.
mBSS: monoallelic Bernard-Soulier syndrome; MYH9-RD: MYH9-
related disease; . ANKRD26-RT: ANKRD26-related
thrombocytopenia. XLT/WAS: X-linked thrombocytopenia/Wiskott-
Aldrich syndrome. Mean values of platelet count at baseline and at
the end of part 1 of the treatment along with their 95% confidence
intervals (95%CI) are reported in the gray box.
Ten of the 12 patients with spontaneous bleeding at baseline
(83.3%) obtained complete remission of bleeding. In particular, all
responders (major or minor response) achieved disappearance of
bleeding symptoms if present at baseline. Of the two non-
responders, the patient with ANKRD26-RT did not obtain any
improvement of bleeding manifestations, whereas the patient with
ITGB3-RT experienced a reduction of spontaneous bleeding (WHO
grade from 2 to 1) following a slight increase in platelet count
(from 62 to 78 ×10/L).
Ten patients (43.5%) achieved a major response with eltrombopag
50 mg/day and stopped therapy (Table 3). These patients were all
the individuals with MYH9-RD or mBSS who obtained a major
response and one subject with ANKRD26-RT. Thus, 13 patients
(56.5%) switched to the dosage of 75 mg/day. Treatment with the
higher dose resulted in the achievement of a better response
according to the study criteria in four of these subjects (Table 3).
[image]
Table 3.Doses of eltrombopag administered during part 1 of the
study.
In vitro platelet aggregation in response to collagen, ADP, and


ristocetin, was studied at the end of treatment in the 11 patients
who achieved platelet counts >100×10/L. Platelet aggregation
was normal in all the cases, except for two patients with MYH9-RD
and one with mBSS who had slightly reduced responses to the
lowest ADP dose (Online Supplementary Table S7). In 12 patients,
platelet activation in response to ADP and TRAP was also assessed
through flow cytometry as the induction of surface expression of P-
selectin and of the activated form of GPIIb-IIIa.24 In these subjects,
platelet activation at baseline was not significantly different from
that of healthy controls. Overall, platelet responsiveness did not
change significantly after eltrombopag treatment with respect to
baseline in the investigated patients (Online Supplementary Figure
S2).
The mean serum thrombopoietin level at baseline was 177.8 pg/mL
[standard deviation (SD) 125]. Thrombopoietin levels were
unchanged at the end of treatment both considering patients overall
and stratifying them according to the different disorders or response
to treatment (Online Supplementary Table S8).
We recorded seven adverse events in five patients (21%) (Table 4):
all the adverse events were grade 1 (mild) according to Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. Four
patients reported mild and transient headache and/or diffuse bone
pain during the first 2-3 days of treatment. One patient with
ANKRD26-RT presented with increased plasma creatinine at the
assessment after 3 weeks of treatment with 50 mg/day. Although
this adverse event was grade 1 (creatinine 1.6 times above
baseline), treatment was discontinued according to the study
protocol. Further investigations showed that kidney dysfunction
was due to urinary retention because of pre-existing benign
prostatic hypertrophy and suggested that a causal relationship
between eltrombopag administration and the adverse event was
unlikely (see Table 4 for details). Results of an ophthalmic
assessment at the end of therapy were unchanged in all cases,
including the three patients with MYH9-RD who had cataracts at
baseline.

Table 4.Adverse events recorded during part 1 of the study. All the
adverse events were grade 1 according to the Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0.
Part 2 of the study
Six patients met the criteria for enrollment in part 2 of the study.
Two of them did not consent to long-term treatment for logistic
reasons, as they were not available to undergo the repeated visits
planned by the study protocol. Thus, four patients entered part 2 (2
with MYH9-RD, 1 with WAS, 1 with ITGB3-RT). At baseline all of
them had spontaneous mucosal hemorrhages WHO grade 2 or 3
(epis-taxis, gum bleeding, menorrhagia, and/or hematochezia)
(Table 5).
[image]
Table 5.Response in part 2 of the study in the four patients enrolled.
The outcome of part 2 of the study is summarized in Table 5 and
Figure 2. Three patients completed the 16 weeks of therapy. All of
them obtained a stable remission of mucosal bleeding throughout
the treatment period. During eltrombopag administration, they
experienced only very mild and occasional easy bruising (WHO
grade 1), resulting in a minor response according to the study
criteria. Concerning the patient with WAS, treatment was
discontinued after 8 weeks because of exacerbation of cutaneous
eczema (see below). During treatment, this patient obtained a
complete remission of bleeding (WHO grade 0).
[image]
Figure 2.Effects of treatments in part 1 and part 2 of the study
in the four individuals who received long-term eltrombopag
therapy. The figure summarizes the effects of eltrombopag
administration on bleeding symptoms according to the World
Health Organization (WHO) bleeding scale and on platelet count.
Patients 1/1 and 12/10 have MYH9-related disease, patient 17/13
has ITGB3-RT, and patient 22/16 has Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome


(see Table 5).
Two patients achieved a response with eltrombopag 25 mg/day,
whereas two patients required 50 mg/day (Table 5, Figure 2).
The reduction of bleeding symptoms was associated with an overall
increase in the scores obtained with the FACT-TH18 and FACIT-F
questionnaires (Online Supplementary Table S9). The increase was
evident in the two MYH9-RD patients presenting the highest degree
of bleeding tendency at baseline (WHO grade 3), whereas the two
other patients obtained mild or no improvements.
The thrombopoietin levels of the four patients did not change
significantly during part 2 of the study. Platelet response to ADP
and TRAP was assessed by flow cytome-try in the two MYH9-RD
patients and the WAS patient and did not show any significant
changes with long-term eltrombopag (data not shown).
The patient with WAS reported exacerbation of a preexisting
cutaneous eczema, which is a typical manifestation of the genetic
disease. For this reason, eltrombopag was discontinued after 8
weeks of part 2 of the study. The adverse event was grade 2
according to CTCAE version 3.0. The patient described a similar
exacerbation of the eczema before enrollment into this study, which
occurred without any apparent causes. However, the eczema
improved some weeks after eltrombopag discontinuation,
supporting a causal relationship with the treatment. No additional
adverse events were observed during part 2 therapy. In particular,
no occurrence or worsening of cataracts was observed, even in the
two patients with MYH9-RD who had cataracts at baseline.
Post-treatment assessments
Twenty patients were re-evaluated 30 days after the end of part 1 or
2 (3 patients refused the visit). Post-treatment assessments did not
identify any adverse events. The mean platelet count was 47.0×10/
L (SD 26), similar to that at baseline in the same patients
(40.9×10/L, SD 23). The bleeding tendency returned to that
recorded at baseline in all the cases.


Discussion
TPO-RA represent an appealing hypothesized treatment for the
majority of patients with thrombocytopenias of genetic origin. In
fact, in most forms of inherited thrombocytopenia, the
megakaryocyte response to thrombopoietin is totally or partially
preserved:2625 TPO-RA can therefore potentially increase platelet
production in many of these disorders. Moreover, in most patients
with inherited thrombocytopenia platelet function is normal or only
partially impaired, so that increasing platelet count is expected to
improve hemostasis.2725 Patients with an inherited
thrombocytopenia may benefit from short-term courses of TPO-RA
as well as prolonged treatment. Short-term courses may be given in
preparation for elective surgery or other invasive procedures
whenever the platelet count is below the safe threshold for the
specific procedure. In this context, TPO-RA can replace
perioperative platelet transfusions, thus preventing
alloimmunization and the other risks of blood derivatives, and
provide an option to increase platelet count even in patients
refractory to platelet transfusions.15141210 On the other hand,
patients with clinically significant spontaneous bleeding may
benefit from long-term TPO-RA administration to achieve an
enduring remission of bleeding symptoms and reduce the risk of
major hemorrhages. Despite these premises, clinical evidence on the
efficacy and safety of TPO-RA in inherited thrombocytopenias is
very scarce.28
The only previous prospective study investigated the short-term use
of eltrombopag in patients with MYH9-RD and showed that most
patients responded to treatment without major side effects.9 The
present trial investigates the response to short-term eltrombopag in
a wider range of inherited thrombocytopenias, and provides
information on the effects of prolonged treatment in those patients
with clinically significant spontaneous hemorrhages.
We gave a short-term course of eltrombopag to patients affected
with five different disorders: the large majority of them (91.3%)
responded to the drug and the mean platelet count at the end of
therapy was increased by 64.5×10/L compared to baseline
(P<0.001). However, we observed some differences in the degree


of platelet response between the patients with the different forms of
inherited thrombocytopenia. Eltrombopag was highly effective in
MYH9-RD, thus confirming and extending the results of the
previous trial.9 All the MYH9-RD patients responded, most of them
(78%) reached a platelet count >100×10/L, and the mean
increase in platelet count compared to baseline was 98.1×10/L.
The two individuals with mBSS also achieved major responses with
an increase in platelet count close to that of MYH9-RD subjects
(80.5×10/L). Although seven of the eight evaluable patients with
ANKRD26-RT responded to eltrombopag, the extent of platelet
response was globally lower than that in MYH9-RD and mBSS
patients: in fact, most ANKRD26-RT subjects obtained minor
responses and the mean increase in platelet count in responders was
41.8×10/L. In the three XLT/WAS patients, results appeared
similar to those of ANKRD26-RT: these patients reached a minor
response with an average rise in platelet count of 41.4×10/L. In
spite of these differences, we believe that in all the above disorders
the response to eltrombopag is highly relevant with regards to the
use of the drug in preparation for surgery in clinical practice. In
fact, current guidelines define a platelet count of 50×10/L as the
threshold level recommended for major surgery, with the exception
of neurosurgery and posterior eye surgery that require a platelet
count of 100×10/L.54 In this view, while the response observed in
MYH9-RD and mBSS appears a very good result, even the extent of
the increase in platelet count obtained in ANKRD26-RT and XLT/
WAS appears sufficient to avoid the use of platelet transfusions to
prepare most patients for most surgical procedures.
Finally, we treated only one patient with ITGB3-RT, who failed to
achieve a platelet response according to the study criteria.
All the patients who responded in part 1 of the study, even those
achieving a minor response, had complete remission of bleeding
symptoms whenever these were present at baseline. Even one of the
two patients classified as non-responders according to the study
criteria, experienced the remission of mucosal bleeding following a
slight increase in platelet count. Remission of bleeding is consistent
with the results of platelet function studies during eltrombopag
treatment: since platelet responses to different agonists were normal
or only slightly impaired, increasing platelet count was effective in


improving hemostasis. Consistent with previous findings in XLT/
WAS patients,18 flow cytometry showed that platelet
responsiveness to ADP and TRAP does not change significantly with
eltrombopag administration.
Concerning the dosage of eltrombopag, ten of the 11 patients who
achieved a major response obtained this result with a dose of 50
mg/day, while one patient required a dose of 75 mg/day. Overall,
ten of the 13 patients who were switched from 50 to 75 mg/day
obtained a further increase of platelet count with the higher dose:
four subjects reached a better response according to the study
criteria, while six patients achieved only slightly higher platelet
counts. All the patients with ANKRD26-RT or XLT/WAS, but one,
required the switch to the higher dose, which resulted in a higher
platelet count in most cases. These data suggest that 75 mg/day is
the most reasonable starting dose for preoperative eltrombopag in
patients with either of these two disorders.
Effects of long-term eltrombopag administration were investigated
in four patients who had frequent episodes of spontaneous mucosal
bleeding. All of them achieved a sta ble remission of mucosal
hemorrhages and the remission persisted throughout the treatment
period. In two patients, the reduction of spontaneous bleeding was
associated with a very slight increase of platelet count (around
10×10/L). The same observation was previously made in a patient
with WAS who was given long-term treatment with eltrombopag
because of severe bleeding symptoms.17 Two patients achieved
remission of bleeding with the dosage of 25 mg/day, suggesting
that, in some patients with inherited thrombocytopenia, clinical
benefit can be maintained with prolonged administration of
relatively low doses of eltrombopag. Interestingly, the two patients
with the greatest bleeding tendency at baseline experienced not
only stable improvements of HR-QoL related to bleeding, but also
an increase of the score measuring the subjective perception of
fatigue.
The observation that some patients obtained a significant reduction
of bleeding tendency following a very slight increase in platelet
count suggests that eltrombopag may improve some discrete
platelet functions in addition to raising platelet concentration. As


mentioned, overall we did not observe any significant change in
platelet GPIIb-IIIa activation or P-selectin expression in response to
ADP and TRAP after eltrombopag treatment compared to that at
baseline, in 12 investigated patients. However, we cannot exclude
that the drug could have improved some other mechanisms of
platelet function29 in some patients, and further investigations are
required to explore this hypothesis.
Short-term treatment with eltrombopag was globally well tolerated,
with 17% of patients reporting mild and transient headache and/or
bone pain at the beginning of treatment. In one ANKRD26-RT
patient, we observed a slight increase in plasma creatinine; clinical
investigation of this subject suggested that a causal relationship
between eltrombopag and this adverse event was unlikely.
Regarding long-term treatment, the patient affected with WAS
experienced worsening of a pre-existing cutaneous eczema that
required eltrombopag discontinuation after 14 weeks. This adverse
event had never been described in the previous retrospective
reports on WAS patients who received eltrombopag.1817 No other
adverse events were recorded with long-term therapy.
Eltrombopag has been associated with the occurrence of cataracts in
patients with immune thrombocytopenia,30 and MYH9-RD is a
syndromic disorder predisposing to cataracts.31 Thus, it is
noteworthy that none of our MYH9-RD subjects showed
development or progression of cataracts, not even the two patients
who received long-term therapy and already had cataracts at
baseline.
A previous study raised the suspicion that the TPO-RA romiplostim
favors progression to myeloid leukemia in patients with
myelodysplastic syndromes.32 Subsequent trials of eltrombopag
monotherapy in myelodysplastic syndromes did not reveal any
safety issues in this regard:3533 however, a trend to an increased
risk of disease progression was reported in a study in which
eltrombopag was tested in association with azacitidine in
intermediate- or high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes.36 These
observations raise concerns about the safety of TPO-RA in
ANKRD26-RT, a condition that increases the risk of myeloid
malignancies.37 In the present study, short-term use of eltrombopag


did not result in any changes of blood cell parameters or
morphology (with the exception of platelet count) in ANKRD26-RT
patients. However, further clinical data on this topic are needed,
and caution should be used when treating individuals with
ANKRD26-RT or other inherited thrombocytopenias predisposing to
hematological malignancies38 with TPO-RA, especially with long-
term administration.
In conclusion, this study shows that eltrombopag was effective in
increasing platelet count in four different forms of inherited
thrombocytopenia, which, taken together, affect more than 55% of
patients with genetic thrombocy-topenias.28 In most patients, short-
term administration of eltrombopag increased platelet count above
the threshold for major surgery recommended by current
guidelines,54 indicating that the drug can efficiently replace
perioperative platelet transfusions in preparation for surgery or
other invasive procedures. Although only four patients received
long-term treatment, the results indicate that prolonged
eltrombopag therapy can induce persistent remission of
spontaneous bleeding. Both short- and long-term treatments were
globally well tolerated. Although a greater amount of clinical data
on the use of TPO-RA in inherited thrombocytopenias is certainly
required, our results suggest that eltrombopag will probably have a
central role in the treatment of thrombocytopenias of genetic origin.
