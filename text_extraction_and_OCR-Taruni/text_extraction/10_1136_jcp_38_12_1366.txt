SUMMARY Features of rejection were found in 21 needle biopsies obtained from seven patients after
liver transplantation. Wedge biopsies taken peroperatively were used as a baseline for comparison.
Rejection was diagnosed by excluding other known causes of graft dysfunction using appropriate
methods. In cases in which these criteria were fulfilled a consistent picture of rejection was seen, and
this was useful in clinical management. Two features constantly present in cases of acute rejection
were: a dense mixed portal inflammatory infiltrate; and polymorphonuclear infiltration of biliary
epithelium.
Early studies of liver allograft pathology that were
primarily based on necropsy findings ascribed a wide
range of lesions to rejection.`3 Liver biopsies were
rarely performed during this period, and interpreting
them was difficult.45 Recent studies illustrate the use￾fulness of performing serial biopsies for the diagnosis
and management of rejection, although there are still
differences in the histological features ascribed to
rejection.67
The purpose of our study was to determine whether
consistent and reliable histological features of rejec￾tion could be identified in biopsies from patients in
whom other causes of graft dysfunction had been
excluded.
Material and methods
CLINICAL DATA
Twenty-three patients underwent orthotopic liver
transplantation at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital
between January 1982 and May 1985. Biopsies were
performed to assess graft dysfunction in 10 of the last
15 patients who had undergone surgery (orthotopic
liver transplants, O.L. 10-O.L. 24). In all cases a diag￾nosis of rejection was supported by the exclusion of
other known causes of graft dysfunction. Infection
was excluded by bile culture and cytomegalovirus
complement serology; biliary obstruction by T tube
cholangiography; and ischaemia by a combination of
clinical, radiological, and histological criteria. All
patients had an internal T tube until three months
after the operation: this allowed regular bile culture
and cholangiography to be carried out. Hepatic arte￾riography was performed to exclude hepatic artery
thrombosis in one patient (case 1).
Accepted for publication 21 August 1985
Three of the 10 biopsied patients were considered
to have graft dysfunction due to factors other than
rejection and were therefore excluded from this study.
In these three cases (O.L. 11, 12, and 20) severe per￾operative technical problems occurred, which resulted
in considerable loss of blood. Further haemorrhage
and hypotension complicated the postoperative
course, and wedge biopsies for bleeding obtained at
repeat laparotomy showed centrilobular to sub￾massive necrosis compatible with ischaemic damage.
All three died 15-24 days after transplantation, and
necropsy confirmed the presence of extensive hepatic
infarction and opportunistic infection.
Table 1 summarises the clinical details of the
remaining seven patients and the timing of their biop￾sies.
HISTOLOGICAL DATA
Peroperative wedge biopsies were carried out as a
baseline assessment in all seven patients. Twenty one
percutaneous biopsies were obtained using a Men￾ghini needle (16G or 17G, 1-4mm or 16mm
diameter). Biopsy specimens were fixed in formalin
and embedded in paraffin. Sections were stained with
haematoxylin and eosin, reticulin, van Gieson, peri￾odic acid Schiff (with and without diastase digestion),
Orcein, and Perls's iron stain. In one patient (case 2)
a hepatectomy specimen was available for study. In
another patient (case 1) the liver obtained at necropsy
was examined.
Table 2 summarises the features that were assessed.
The severity of portal inflammation was graded semi￾quantitatively according to the proportion of portal
areas affected and the intensity of inflammation
within them. The presence of an acute inflammatory
component was also considered in assessing the sever￾1366 Protected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies.

Results
PEROPERATIVE BIOPSIES
Abnormalities were invariably present in the per￾operative biopsy specimens, although these were usu￾ally unimportant. All seven showed centrilobular
hepatocyte vacuolation and necrosis. In four cases
there was bridging necrosis and frank subcapsular
infarction. All the histological changes seen in these
biopsies improved on subsequent biopsy, although
two cases showed persistent centrilobular necrosis or
fibrosis, or both (cases 1 and 2). The severity of
changes seen in peroperative biopsy specimens was
not related to the cold ischaemic time.
POSTOPERATIVE BIOPSIES
Histological changes of rejection were seen between
six days and five months after transplantation
(Table 2).
PORTAL INFLAMMATION AND BILE DUCT
DAMAGE
Acute rejection was characterised by a dense mixed
portal inflammatory infiltrate composed mainly of
lymphocytes and neutrophils with smaller numbers of
1367
plasma cells, macrophages, and eosinophils. A partic￾ularly striking finding was the presence of poly￾morphs surrounding and infiltrating the epithelium of
small bile ducts and ductules (Fig. 1). This was associ￾ated with a variable degree of nuclear hyper￾chromatism and cytoplasmic vacuolation of the bili￾ary epithelium. These acute changes were seen in nine
biopsy specimens taken six to 18 days after trans￾plantation.
In one patient (case 2) the acute bile duct lesion was
followed by complete loss of ducts on the 28th day
after transplantation (Fig. 2) and led to graft failure
necessitating retransplantation. In another patient
(case 1) acute inflammation subsided, but bile duct
epithelium showed severe focal atypia resembling that
seen in graft v host disease (Fig. 3).8 In the remaining
five cases treatment with immunosuppression resulted
in clinical improvement and resolution of histological
changes, although a residual, mild and predominantly
mononuclear infiltrate persisted in all these cases.
The hepatectomy specimen removed for chronic
rejection (case 2) showed complete absence of small
bile ducts. Larger ducts showed features similar to
those noted in smaller ducts in previous biopsies with
the additional finding of numerous foamy histiocytes
in surrounding connective tissue (Fig. 4). A small
amount of material resistant to diastase and positive
for periodic acid Schiff was present in their cyto￾plasm, but fat stains yielded a negative result.

VASCtJLAR CHANGES
Inflammation was commonly present in portal and,
to a lesser extent, central veins. Most cases were
graded as mild or moderate and showed occasional
lymphocytes adherent to the luminal surface of
venular endothelium and focal endothelial hyper￾plasia.
In three cases graded as severe there was sub￾endothelial infla'mmation and disruption of the endo￾thelium (Fig. 5). These were biopsies performed six
days (case 4) and seven days (cases 3 and 5) after
transplantation. Inflammation rapidly subsided after
immunosuppressive treatment, although mild
inflammation was seen in subsequent biopsies.
Changes in hepatic artery branches were rarely
found and usually only present to a minor degree. In
two cases (one necropsy specimen, case 1; one sur￾gically removed liver, case 2) there was subendothelial
accumulation of lipid laden macrophages causing
severe luminal narrowing of large arterial branches in
the hepatic porta (Fig. 6). This change was present at
five and two months, respectively. In both cases pre￾vious biopsies had shown centrilobular necrosis and
reticulin collapse suggestive of ischaemic damage, but
no abnormalities had been seen in small arteries.
Hubscher, Clements, Elias, McMaster
CHOLESTASIS
Centrilobular cholestasis was a common, though not
universal, feature of acute rejection, being virtually
absent in one patient (case 3) whose biopsy had the
typical portal changes described above. In the other
patients (cases 4, 5, 6, and 7), whose portal changes
resolved after immunosuppression, cholestasis persis￾ted in subsequent biopsies performed up to 28 days
later and caused difficulty in interpretation. In one
case (5) the presence of worsening cholestasis with
bile infarcts and a small bile lake suggested the possi￾bility of large duct obstruction, which was excluded
radiologically. Continued treatment with low dose
immunosuppression resulted in gradual clinical and
biochemical recovery in all these cases and histologi￾cally, bile pigment was reduced in canaliculi and
increased in the cytoplasm of Kupffer cells.
LOBULAR INFLAMMATION AND ACIDOPHIL
BODIES
Inflammation was often present in centrilobular areas
in association with degeneration of hepatocytes due
to bile stasis. In four biopsy specimens tiny discrete
polymorph clusters unrelated to cholestasis were scat￾tered randomly within the lobules (Fig. 7). Isolated

acidophil bodies were also seen in association with
centrilobular cholestasis and portal inflammation,
but in three biopsy specimens small aggregates were
scattered randomly within the lobules (Fig. 8). Viral
inclusions or serological evidence of viral infection
were not present in any of these cases.
Discussion
Liver biopsy has a potentially useful part to play in
the diagnosis and management of liver allograft rejec￾tion as there are no specific clinical, biochemical, or
other markers of rejection. In view of the liver's
limited range of responses to injury other causes of
graft dysfunction should be excluded before any
changes seen are ascribed to rejection. Failure to do
so may account for the difficulty experienced in inter￾preting biopsies in early series.45 Necropsy studies are
also unhelpful as a guide to interpreting biopsy speci￾mens during life as the changes of rejection are often
advanced and may be indistinguishable from other
complications that contribute to death.9"0
Applying the criteria of exclusion, two recent stud￾ies, one prospective6 and the other retrospective,7
reported that biopsies were useful in the clinical man￾agement of patients with rejection. In both reports
several biopsies were performed on each patient
allowing the evolution of lesions and their
modification by treatment to be monitored.
In this study the most consistent and diagnostically
useful feature of acute rejection was the presence of a
mixed portal inflammatory infiltrate, together with

the highly characteristic lesion of acute bile duct dam￾age by polymorphs. This agrees with the findings of
Snover et al7 but differs from those of Eggink et al,6
who describe a picture similar to chronic active hepa￾titis without evidence of destruction of bile ducts. The
reason for this disparity is uncertain. One possible
explanation is a difference in immunosuppression as
cyclosporin A is used routinely in Minnesota and
Birmingham after the immediate postoperative
period while the Dutch group continue treatment
with azathioprine. Early reports of rejection before
the advent of cyclosporin A also described spillover of
portal inflammation into lobules, a particularly strik￾ing example being seen in one patient in whom immu￾nosuppression was deliberately withheld because of
possible viral infection (Fig I in Williams et al2). A
similar process has been described in untreated canine
allografts. 1 12
The bile duct lesion seen in rejection has been lik￾ened to that which occurs in primary biliary cirrhosis
and graft v host disease (GVHD) and a unifying
mechanism proposed for duct damage in these three
conditions based on their anatomical similarity.1314
The susceptibility of bile ducts to damage by rejection
may be due to expression of HLA class IV5 or class
1116 antigens, neither of which is normally expressed
on hepatocytes.'718 Similar mechanisms have been
proposed for bile duct damage in primary biliary
cirrhosis19 and chronic GVHD.20
Although similar mechanisms could account for
the apparent selectivity of bile duct damage in these
three conditions, the histological features of acute

rejection in this study are distinctive and differ from
those seen in either primary biliary cirrhosis or
chronic GVHD. The presence of numerous poly￾morphs surrounding and infiltrating the wall of bile
ducts was a consistent feature of acute rejection and
did not occur to any important degree in the two
other cases. A polymorphonuclear infiltrate related to
bile ducts might suggest a diagnosis of ascending cho￾langitis.6 In all our cases polymorphs were absent
from the biliary lumen, and infection was excluded by
bile culture.
Disappearance of bile ducts was first described as a
complication of transplantation by Calne et al and
has been ascribed to chronic immune mediated bile
duct damage,"4 ischaemia related to poor surgical
technique,6 and ischaemia due to chronic vascular
rejection (DGD Wight, personal communication).
The pattern of damage and course of events in our
patient with disappearing duct syndrome (case 2) is
more in favour of immune mediated rather than
ischaemic damage. The resemblance of bile duct dam￾age in the other patient with chronic rejection (case 1,
Fig. 3) to that seen in chronic GVHD also favours an
immunological mechanism.
Venous endothelial changes of acute rejection were
not seen to an important degree in this study, in con￾trast to the findings of Snover et al,7 who included
these as part of their diagnostic triad of acute rejec￾tion (portal inflammation, bile duct damage, and
endothelialitis of portal or central veins). Endothelial
damage was also a regular finding in the study of
Demetris et al.2" This disparity may be a consequence
of differences in immunosuppressive regimens and the
timing of biopsies. Endothelial inflammation, a strik￾ing feature of uncontrolled acute rejection in
animals'2 and man,2 rapidly resolves following
immunosuppression and is not described in chronic
rejection.
Arterial changes of rejection may be prominent in
large intrahepatic arteries but not seen in needle biop￾sies which only sample small vessels. Their presence
may be suspected in biopsies if centrilobular necrosis
or fibrosis is seen and other causes of hypoperfusion
are excluded.
Centrilobular cholestasis is a common finding in
rejection and is possibly a consequence of bile duct
damage. It is not an invariable finding, being minimal
in one patient whose biopsies had typical portal and
bile duct lesions. Persistence and even worsening of
cholestasis may occur after the successful treatment
of acute rejection. This may lead to difficulty in histo￾logical diagnosis and clinical management, particu￾larly if a biopsy performed during the acute episode is
not available for comparison. It is our experience that
if other causes of cholestasis have been excluded it
is not associated with an adverse prognosis and
Hubscher, Clements, Elias, McMaster
resolves without additional immunosuppression. We
did not see any examples corresponding to the picture
of pure or functional cholestasis described in other
studies.621
The presence of polymorph and acidophil clusters
scattered randomly within lobules is a finding of
unknown importance. Although suggestive of viral
infection, no inclusions or serological evidence of
viral infection were present in any of the patients. In
the absence of more sensitive probes for detecting
cytomegalovirus and other viruses in sections22 the
possibility that these lesions represent occult viral
infection cannot be excluded, although their clinical
importance is uncertain in patients with other histo￾logical features of rejection and clinical improvement
with immunosuppression.
Abnormalities were invariably present in per￾operative biopsies, in contrast to the findings of Egg￾ink et al,6 and are probably a reflection of more pro￾longed cold ischaemic times. None of the abnormal
features noted in the baseline biopsies had any appar￾ent adverse prognostic importance.
In conclusion, the present study showed that liver
biopsies were useful in the diagnosis and management
of rejection after transplantation. If other causes of
graft dysfunction are excluded the changes seen and
described here are highly characteristic. A mixed por￾tal inflammatory infiltrate and polymorphonuclear
infiltration of biliary epithelium are the two most con￾sistent and diagnostically useful features of acute
rejection of liver allografts. Both changes rapidly
resolve after successful immunosuppressive treatment
and are associated with clinical and biochemical
recovery.
