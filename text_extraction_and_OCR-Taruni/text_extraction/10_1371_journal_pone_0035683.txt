Abstract
Aim: We recently reported that glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) prevents the development of
atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-null (Apoe2/2) mice. GIP receptors (GIPRs) are found to be severely down-regulated in
diabetic animals. We examined whether GIP can exert anti-atherogenic effects in diabetes.
Methods: Nondiabetic Apoe2/2 mice, streptozotocin-induced diabetic Apoe2/2 mice, and db/db mice were administered
GIP (25 nmol/kg/day) or saline (vehicle) through osmotic mini-pumps for 4 weeks. The animals were assessed for aortic
atherosclerosis and for oxidized low-density lipoprotein-induced foam cell formation in exudate peritoneal macrophages.
Results: Diabetic Apoe2/2 mice of 21 weeks of age exhibited more advanced atherosclerosis than nondiabetic Apoe2/2
mice of the same age. GIP infusion in diabetic Apoe2/2 mice increased plasma total GIP levels by 4-fold without improving
plasma insulin, glucose, or lipid profiles. GIP infusion significantly suppressed macrophage-driven atherosclerotic lesions,
but this effect was abolished by co-infusions with [Pro3
]GIP, a GIPR antagonist. Foam cell formation was stimulated by 3-fold
in diabetic Apoe2/2 mice compared with their nondiabetic counterparts, but this effect was halved by GIP infusion. GIP
infusion also attenuated the foam cell formation in db/db mice. In vitro treatment with GIP (1 nM) reduced foam cell
formation by 15% in macrophages from diabetic Apoe2/2 mice, and this attenuating effect was weaker than that attained
by the same treatment of macrophages from nondiabetic counterparts (35%). While GIPR expression was reduced by only
about a half in macrophages from diabetic mice, it was reduced much more dramatically in pancreatic islets from the same
animals. Incubation with high glucose (500 mg/dl) for 9–10 days markedly reduced GIPR expression in pancreatic islet cells,
but not in macrophages.
Conclusions: Long-term infusion of GIP conferred significant anti-atherogenic effects in diabetic mice even though the GIPR
expression in macrophages was mildly down-regulated in the diabetic state.

Introduction
Type 2 diabetes is well known to accelerate the course of
atherosclerosis, a condition associated with arterial endothelial
dysfunction, macrophage foam cell formation, and vascular
smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation. New treatments based
on incretins provide a novel approach to mediate parts of the
complex pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes [1–2]. Incretin-based
therapies have been reported to improve vascular inflammation
and endothelial dysfunction beyond glucose normalization [3].
Indeed, several experimental studies have revealed that incretin￾based treatments, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)
receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors,
significantly suppress the development of atherosclerosis in animal
models [4–8]. In 2011, our group reported that GLP-1 and
glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), two native
incretins, elicited anti-atherogenic effects in apolipoprotein-E-null
(Apoe2/2) mice, an animal model of atherosclerosis [9]. Then,
more recently, we found that a DPP-4 inhibitor, an enhancer of
endogenous GLP-1 and GIP, prevented the development of
atherosclerosis in the same animal model [10].
It is well known that GLP-1 exerts insulinotropic action whereas
GIP looses this action in diabetes [11,12]. Several lines of
experimental evidence have revealed that GIP receptors (GIPRs)
in pancreatic islets are substantially down-regulated under a
persistent hyperglycemic condition [13–17]. This may explain the
inability of GIP to induce insulin secretion in diabetes. If GIPRs
turn out to be down-regulated in other tissues besides the
pancreatic islets, the extra-pancreatic effects of GIP will presum￾ably be attenuated or lost. Thinking along these lines, we decided
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 4 | e35683

to investigate whether GIP exerts anti-atherogenic effects in
diabetic Apoe2/2 mice as well as nondiabetic Apoe2/2 mice.
Materials and Methods
Animals
Animal experiments were performed in accordance with the
NIH guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of Showa University.
Experiment 1: Ninety 8-week-old Apoe2/2 mice were purchased
from Sankyo Labo Service (Tokyo, Japan) and kept on a normal
chow until the start of the GIP infusion described below. When the
Apoe2/2 mice reached the age of 15 weeks, the animals were given
multiple peritoneal injections of streptozotocin (STZ, 50 mg/kg/
day) for 5 consecutive days to induce diabetes, according to the
method described by Takeda et al. [18]. Two weeks later, animals
with a 6-hour fasting blood glucose (Glutest Sensor, Sanwa
Chemical, Tokyo) of greater than 200 mg/dl were selected as
diabetic. These 17-week-old diabetic Apoe2/2 mice were then
infused with human GIP(1–42) (25 nmol/kg/day, Abgent, San
Diego, CA) or saline (vehicle) for 4 weeks through osmotic mini￾pumps (Alzet Model 1007D, Durect, Cupertino, CA) [9]. In a
subset of diabetic Apoe2/2 mice, a GIPR antagonist called
[Pro3
]GIP (25 nmol/kg/day, Abgent) was co-infused with the
GIP through other mini-pumps [9]. As nondiabetic controls, 17-
week-old Apoe2/2 mice without the STZ pretreatment were
infused with saline for 4 weeks through osmotic mini-pumps.
When the continuous GIP infusion was commenced, the animals
were also started on an atherogenic diet containing 30% fat, 20%
sucrose, 8% NaCl, and 500 mg/g cholesterol (Oriental Yeast,
Tokyo) [9,19].
Experiment 2: 17 db/db mice, a mouse model of type 2 diabetes,
and 10 db/misty mice, a control group, were purchased from
Sankyo Labo Service at the age of 6 weeks and kept on normal
chow. From the age of 8 weeks, a point at which diabetes is
established to be active in db/db mice, 10 db/misty mice and 11
diabetic db/db mice were infused with saline (vehicle) through
osmotic mini-pumps for 4 weeks, and the other 6 db/db mice were
infused with GIP (25 nmol/kg/day) under the same conditions.
Measurements
Four weeks after infusion, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was
measured using indirect tail-cuff equipment (MK-2000, Muroma￾chi Kikai, Tokyo) [9,20]. Blood samples were collected after a 6-
hour fast. Plasma concentrations of glucose, total-cholesterol (TC),
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglyceride
were measured by enzymatic methods using an autoanalyzer
(Hitachi 7020, Hitachi, Tokyo) [20]. Non-HDL-C was calculated
as TC minus HDL-C. Non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) was
measured by an NEFA C-test (Wako, Osaka, Japan). Plasma
concentrations of total GIP, total GLP-1 and insulin were
determined by ELISA (Millipore, Billerica, MA; Morinaga,
Yokohama, Japan) [9,10].
Assessment of atherosclerotic lesions
Four weeks after infusion, the mice were anesthetized with
diethyl ether. The whole aorta was washed with perfused PBS and
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde [20,21]. The aorta was excised
from the root to the abdominal area and the connective and
adipose tissues were carefully removed. The entire aorta and cross￾sections of the aortic root were stained with oil red O for the
assessment of atherosclerotic lesions [20,21]. Monocyte/macro￾phage infiltration into atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic roots was
visualized by staining with anti-mouse MOMA-2 antibody
(Abcam, Tokyo) [9,10,20,21]. The atherosclerotic lesions and
areas with monocyte/macrophage migration were traced by an
investigator blind to the treatment and measured by an image
analyzer (Adobe Photoshop, San Jose, CA and NIH Scion Image,
Frederick, MD) [9,10,20,21].
Cholesterol esterification assay
The mice were given intraperitoneal injections of 4 ml of aged￾autoclaved thioglycolate broth just after the 4-week infusion
period, and the exudate peritoneal cells were isolated by peritoneal

lavage with 8 ml of ice-cold PBS 4 days later [19,20]. The cells
were suspended in culture medium (RPMI-1640 containing
200 mg/dl glucose and supplemented with 10% FCS, 0.1 mg/
ml streptomycin, and 100 U/ml penicillin) and seeded onto 6-cm
dishes (46106 cells/2 ml/dish) for real-time reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and 3.5-cm dishes (36106
cells/1 ml/dish) for cholesterol esterification assay, a standard
procedure for assessing foam cell formation. After a 1-hour
incubation at 37uC in 5% CO2 to allow adhesion, the medium was
discarded to remove non-adherent cells. Adherent macrophages
were incubated for 18 hours with culture medium containing
10 mg/ml human oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) in the
presence of 0.1 mM [3
H]oleate conjugated with BSA [19,20].
Cellular lipids were extracted and the radioactivity of the
cholesterol [3
H]oleate was determined by thin-layer chromatog￾raphy [19,20].
In vitro effect of GIP on cholesterol esterification in
macrophages
GIP (1 nM) was added to the cultured mediums of exudate
peritoneal macrophages from nondiabetic and diabetic Apoe2/2
mice. After 24-hour incubation with or without GIP, the cells were
used for cholesterol esterification (foam cell formation) assay
[9,10,19,20].
Measurements of GIPR expression
Exudate peritoneal macrophages from mice, THP-1 cells
(ATCC, Manassas, VA), J774A.1 monocyte-macrophages
(JCRB9108, Human Science, Osaka), and 1.2B4 pancreatic b￾cells (DS Pharma Biomedical, Osaka) were suspended in culture
medium and seeded onto dishes. Each type of cell was cultured
under each standard culture condition and then incubated for 9 to
10 days in high-glucose medium (500 mg/dl). Total RNA was
extracted from the cells using ISOGEN reagent (Nippon-Gene,
Tokyo) before and after the incubation with the high-glucose
medium. The cDNAs were synthesized from isolated RNA
templates with a High-Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied
Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). Real-time RT-PCR was performed
using TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems).
Pre-designed TaqMan probes for GIPR (Mm01316350_g1,
Hs00164732_m1) and 18S rRNA were purchased from Applied
Biosystems [9]. Amplification and fluorescent measurements were
carried out during the elongation step with an ABI PRISM 7900
Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems).
Thin-sliced pancreases and peritoneal macrophages from mice
seeded onto Chamber Slides (Iwaki Asahi Glass, Funabashi, Japan)
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with goat
polyclonal anti-GIPR antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA). Next, the macrophages were stained with anti-goat

of age were made diabetes by peritoneal injection of STZ (50 mg/kg/day) for 5 days and 14 mice were untreated. The 17-week-old diabetic Apoe2/2
mice were infused for 4 weeks with vehicle (control), GIP (25 nmol/kg/day), or GIP+[Pro3
]GIP (both 25 nmol/kg/day) by osmotic mini-pumps. The
aortic surface was stained with oil red O. Cross-sections of the aortic root were stained with oil red O or anti-MOMA-2 antibody. Hematoxylin was
used for nuclear staining. The areas occupied by atherosclerotic lesions and by macrophage infiltration in the aortic wall were determined.

Alexa Fluor 568 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Nuclei and F-actin
cytoskeleton were visualized using DAPI and Phalloidin Alexa
Fluor 488 (Invitrogen). Fluorescence-stained cells were examined
by microscope (Olympus IX71, Olympus, Tokyo).
Statistical analysis
All values are expressed as mean 6 SEM. Comparisons
between 2 groups were performed by the 2-tailed unpaired
Student’s t test. Comparisons among 3 or more groups were
performed by 1-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s post hoc
test. Paired data were compared by the paired Student’s t test.
Statistics were performed using Statview-J 5.0 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC) and differences were considered statistically significant
at P,0.05.
Results
Characteristics and laboratory data
Table 1 lists the blood glucose levels and other parameters in
Apoe2/2 mice. Before infusion (17 weeks of age), glucose levels
were significantly higher in the vehicle-infused, GIP-infused, and
GIP+[Pro3
]GIP-infused diabetic Apoe2/2 mice than in the
nondiabetic Apoe2/2 mice. Four weeks after infusion (21 weeks
of age), glucose levels were significantly higher in the GIP-infused
diabetic group than in the vehicle-infused diabetic group and
GIP+[Pro3
]GIP-infused diabetic group. Food intake in the
diabetic groups was significantly higher than that in the
nondiabetic group. Body weight was significantly decreased in
the vehicle-infused diabetic group and improved in the GIP￾infused and GIP+[Pro3
]GIP-infused diabetic groups. There were
no significant differences in the SBP or heart rate among the four
groups. Plasma insulin levels in the diabetic groups were
significantly lower than the plasma insulin level in the nondiabetic
group. Plasma levels of TC and non-HDL-C were significantly
higher in the diabetic groups than in the nondiabetic group. GIP
infusion had no significant effect on TC or non-HDL-C levels. TC
and non-HDL-C levels were both significantly lower in the
GIP+[Pro3
]GIP-infused diabetic group than in the vehicle- and
GIP-infused diabetic groups. HDL-C levels in the diabetic groups
were significantly lower than the HDL-C level in the nondiabetic
group. Triglyceride and NEFA levels were both comparable
among the four groups. Total GIP levels were 4-fold higher in the
GIP-infused and GIP+[Pro3
]GIP-infused diabetic groups than in
the vehicle-infused diabetic group and nondiabetic group. The
total GLP-1 level in each diabetic group was increased by more
than 3-fold compared with that in the nondiabetic group.
In comparison with the db/misty mice (n = 10), the db/db mice
infused with vehicle (n = 11) exhibited marked hyperglycemia
(37165 vs. 11066 mg/dl, P,0.0001), obesity (4661.2 vs.
2460.2 g, P,0.0001), and hyperinsulinemia (0.9860.26 vs.
0.2660.06 ng/ml, P,0.0001). In comparison with the vehicle￾infused db/db mice, the GIP-infused db/db mice (n = 6) showed a
significant increase in the plasma total GIP level (135664 vs.
6.660.7 pM, P,0.05) but no change in the glucose level (374614
vs. 37165 mg/dl, P = NS).
Atherosclerotic lesions
Atherosclerotic lesions were observed in 21-week-old nondia￾betic Apoe2/2 mice (Fig. 1), and further progressed atherosclerotic
lesions were observed in diabetic Apoe2/2 mice of the same age.
GIP infusion remarkably reduced the surface areas of the
atherosclerotic lesions and suppressed the atheromatous plaque
size and macrophage infiltration in the aortic root, as compared
with vehicle-infused counterparts (Fig. 1). These suppressive effects
of GIP were abolished by the simultaneous infusion with
[Pro3
]GIP (Fig. 1).
The atherosclerotic lesions in the 12-week-old diabetic db/db
mice were not remarkably developed than those in the db/misty
mice (data not shown). When administered to the db/db mice, GIP
failed to induce any conspicuous suppressive effects against the
development of atherosclerotic lesions (data not shown).
Foam cell formation in exudate peritoneal macrophages
As shown in Fig. 2A, oxLDL-induced cholesterol ester (CE)
accumulation in macrophages was 3-fold higher in STZ-induced
diabetic Apoe2/2 mice than in nondiabetic Apoe2/2 mice. Foam

macrophages. A, 12 Apoe2/2 mice at 15 weeks of age were made
diabetes by peritoneal injection of STZ (50 mg/kg/day) for 5 days and 6
Apoe2/2 mice were untreated. The 17-week-old diabetic Apoe2/2 mice
were infused for 4 weeks with vehicle, GIP (25 nmol/kg/day), or
GIP+[Pro3
]GIP (both 25 nmol/kg/day) by osmotic mini-pumps. B, 6 db/
misty mice and 6 db/db mice at 8 weeks of age were started to be
infused with saline and 6 db/db mice were ifused with GIP (25 nmol/kg/
day). Four weeks after infusions, exudate peritoneal macrophages were
obtained from these mice by intraperitoneal injection of thioglycolate,
and incubated with oxLDL (10 mg/ml) for 18 hours. Foam cell formation
was evaluated by oxLDL-induced CE accumulation in macrophages.
Assays were performed in duplicate or single. 1 fold = 17.561.0 nmol/

cell formation in macrophages from GIP-infused diabetic Apoe2/2
mice was suppressed significantly, by as much as one half, in
comparison with that in the vehicle-infused counterpart. The GIP￾induced suppression of foam cell formation was significantly
abolished by the co-infusion with [Pro3
]GIP.
As shown in Fig. 2B, foam cell formation was 5-fold higher in
diabetic db/db mice than in db/misty mice. The GIP infusion,
however, attenuated the foam cell formation significantly, by 40%
in diabetic db/db mice.
Expression of GIPR in exudate peritoneal macrophages
and pancreatic islets
According to real-time RT-PCR, the GIPR mRNA levels in the
exudate peritoneal macrophages of diabetic Apoe2/2 mice were
about half of those in nondiabetic Apoe2/2 mice (Fig. 3A). GIPR
mRNA levels in the exudate peritoneal macrophages from db/db
mice were reduced to the same extent (Fig. 3B). Immunostaining
for GIPR confirmed that the GIPR expressions were lower in the
peritoneal macrophages of diabetic Apoe2/2 mice and db/db mice
than in those of counterpart mice (Figs. 4 and 5). Since the
pancreatic islets were destroyed in STZ-treated Apoe2/2 mice,
only the islets of db/db mice were used for GIPR staining. The
GIPR staining in the islets was much fainter in the db/db mice than
in the db/misty controls (Fig. 6).
Changes in GIPR mRNA levels in cultured macrophages
and pancreatic islet cells
To determine whether the down-regulation of GIPR in diabetic
animals is attributable to hyperglycemia per se, cultured THP-1
(human) and J774A1 (mouse) macrophages were incubated with
high-glucose medium for approximately 10 days. Long-term
incubation with high-glucose medium conferred no suppressive
effect against GIPR mRNA levels in THP-1 macrophages or
J774A1 macrophages, but it did significantly reduce GIPR mRNA

levels in 1.2B4 pancreatic b-cells (human) 4 days after the start of
the high-glucose incubation (Fig. 3C).
In vitro effect of GIP on macrophage foam cell formation
The 24-hour incubation with GIP (1 nM) suppressed foam cell
formation significantly, by 15%, in macrophages from diabetic
Apoe2/2 mice (Fig. 7B). This was weaker than the GIP-induced
suppression of foam formation in macrophages from the
nondiabetic counterpart mice (35%) (Fig. 7A).
Discussion
The atherosclerotic lesions were more severe in diabetic Apoe2/
2 mice than in nondiabetic Apoe2/2 mice. The most prominent
changes in the atherosclerotic lesions were an accumulation of
macrophage foam cells in atheromatous plaques. High glucose
accelerates atherosclerotic lesions and macrophage foam cell
formation associated with increased uptake of oxLDL into
macrophages via the scavenger receptor CD36 in STZ-induced
diabetic Apoe2/2 mice [22]. High glucose also down-regulates
ATP-binding cassette transporters A1 and G1, key molecules for
cholesterol efflux in macrophages, contributing to foam cell
formation [23].
Consistent with our experience in an earlier study with
nondiabetic Apoe2/2 mice [9], our current result confirmed that
chronic GIP infusion suppresses the progression of atherosclerosis
in diabetic Apoe2/2 mice. We know that GIPR mediated this anti￾atherogenic effect, because co-infusion of GIPR antagonist
abolished the GIP-induced suppression of atherosclerosis. GIP
has a potent stimulatory effect on insulin release from the pancreas
under conditions of normal glucose tolerance. Its insulinotropic
action, however, is reduced or even entirely absent in a diabetic
state [11,12]. While the exact mechanisms behind the loss of GIP’s
insulinotropic action in diabetes remains obscure, several lines of
experimental evidence suggest that GIPR is substantially down￾regulated in pancreatic b-cells under a persistent hyperglycemic
condition [13–17]. If GIPR is severely down-regulated in
extrapancreatic cells in a fashion similar to pancreatic b-cells,
the direct anti-atherogenic action of GIP could be largely
diminished or lost. We thus anticipated that the down-regulation
of GIPR may blunt the anti-atherogenic effect of GIP in diabetic
animals.
GIPR gene expression in monocyte-derived macrophages from
diabetic Apoe2/2 mice and db/db mice, a spontaneous diabetic
animal, was about half of that in nondiabetic counterparts. The in
vitro suppressive effect of GIP on foam cell formation was blunted
in macrophages from diabetic mice vs. nondiabetic mice (15% vs.
35%), probably because of the reduced GIPR in the macrophages
in diabetes. As such, we were confident in surmising that the
suppressive effect of GIP against atherosclerosis weakens in a
diabetic condition. Yet contrary to our expectation, chronic
administration of GIP in vivo conferred a satisfactorily anti￾atherogenic effect in the diabetic Apoe2/2 mice. The total plasma
GIP concentration following subcutaneous infusion of human
active GIP at a dose 25 nmol/kg/day was 130–170 pM. This was
4-times higher than the concentration in vehicle-infused mice, but
not a super-physiological concentration [24]. These results suggest
that GIP infusion at a level several-fold higher is sufficient to
confer an anti-atherogenic effect via residual GIPR that eluded the
diabetes-induced down-regulation. Contrary to our finding in
pancreatic b-cells, high glucose left GIPR gene expression
unaffected in cultured macrophages in vitro. We can thus infer
that the down-regulation of GIPR in macrophages requires a long
time, or that the suppression of GIPR expression is association
with other metabolic alterations induced by diabetes. Gupta et al.
[17], for instance, reported that peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor-c (PPAR-c) was reduced in the b-cells of remnant
pancreas in partial pancreatectomized-diabetic rats, and that this
suppression of PPAR-c was closely associated with the down￾regulation of GIPR. Plasma total GLP-1 levels were increased 3-
to 4-fold in every diabetic group. Hyperphagia in STZ-induced
diabetic animals may stimulate GLP-1 production in the intestines.
Glucose levels fell in our vehicle-infused diabetic mice, whereas
GIP infusion worsened the hyperglycemia in diabetes. Intriguing￾ly, co-infusion with [Pro3
]GIP nullified GIP’s pro-hyperglycemic
effect. GIP infusion might exacerbate insulin resistance in the
diabetic mice by increasing adiposity [25]. In contrast to our
finding in STZ-diabetic mice, GIP infusion left glucose levels
unchanged in spontaneous diabetic db/db mice. This suggests that
GIP may modulate the processes of STZ-induced diabetes. The
GIP infusion worsened the hyperglycemia in Apoe2/2 mice, but
atherosclerosis in these animals was milder and less developed.
Meanwhile, GIPR antagonist abolished the anti-atherogenic
effects of GIP in spite of its effect in reducing glucose levels.
These results strongly suggest that the anti-atherogenic effects of
GIP derive from mechanisms with no direct connection to the
amelioration of glucose metabolism. TC and non-HDL-C levels
were both higher in diabetic Apoe2/2 mice than in nondiabetic
Apoe2/2 mice, and the HDL-C level was lower. These lipoprotein
changes may accelerate atherosclerosis in diabetic mice. Plasma
cholesterol levels were unaffected by GIP infusion, but they
decreased when GIP+[Pro3
]GIP was co-infused. It remains
unclear why the co-infusion with [Pro3
]GIP lowered the plasma
cholesterol, but the anti-atherogenic property of GIP is probably
unrelated to the improved atherogenic lipoprotein profile.
Unlike STZ-induced diabetic Apoe2/2 mice, diabetic db/db mice
do not develop visible atherosclerosis in the aorta. Thus, we
investigated foam cell formation in exudate peritoneal macro￾phage as a surrogate marker for the atherosclerosis process in this
animal model of diabetes. Similar to what we found in STZ￾induced diabetic Apoe2/2 mice, foam cell formation was
substantially stimulated in db/db diabetic mice, and the GIP
infusion significantly attenuated foam cell formation without

were obtained from 6 nondiabetic Apoe2/2 mice (A) and 6 STZ-induced
diabetic Apoe2/2 mice (B) by intraperitoneal injection of thioglycolate,
and were incubated with or without GIP (1 nM) for 24 hours followed
by addition of oxLDL (10 mg/ml) for 18 hours. Foam cell formation was
evaluated by oxLDL-induced CE accumulation in macrophages. Assays
were performed in duplicate. 1 fold = 15.661.5 nmol/mg cell protein (A)
and 13.861.0 nmol/mg cell protein (B).

affecting glucose levels. GIPR in pancreatic islets was remarkably
diminished in db/db diabetic mice, whereas that in peritoneal
macrophages was only marginally reduced. This down-regulation
of GIPR in macrophages may have been limited enough to permit
the suppression of foam cell formation by the several-fold increase
of circulating GIP levels.
Conclusions
Chronic administration of GIP remarkably suppressed the
progression of atherosclerosis in STZ-induced diabetic Apoe2/2
mice and suppressed macrophage foam cell formation in both
diabetic Apoe2/2 mice and diabetic db/db mice, even though GIPR
expression in macrophages was mildly down-regulated in the
diabetic state.
