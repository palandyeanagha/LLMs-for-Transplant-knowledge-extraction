Abstract
Introduction Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with high
mortality rates. New biomarkers that can identify subjects with
early AKI (before the increase in serum creatinine) are needed to
facilitate appropriate treatment. The purpose of this study was
to test the role of serum cytokines as biomarkers for AKI and
prolonged mechanical ventilation.
Methods This was a case-control study of children undergoing
cardiac surgery. AKI was defined as a 50% increase in serum
creatinine from baseline within 3 days. Levels of serum
interleukin (IL)-1, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, interferon (IFN)-,
tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), granulocyte colony-stimulating
factor (G-CSF), and granulocyte-macrophage colony￾stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were measured using a bead￾based multiplex cytokine kit in conjunction with flow-based
protein detection and the Luminex LabMAP multiplex system in
18 cases and 21 controls. Levels of IL-6 and IL-8 were
confirmed with single-analyte ELISA; IL-18 was also measured
with single-analyte ELISA.
Results IL-6 levels at 2 and 12 hours after cardiopulmonary
bypass (CPB) and IL-8 levels at 2, 12 and 24 hours were
associated with the development of AKI using the Wilcoxon
rank-sum test and after adjustment for age, gender, race, and
prior cardiac surgery in multivariate logistic regression analysis.
In patients with AKI, IL-6 levels at 2 hours had excellent
predictive value for prolonged mechanical ventilation (defined as
mechanical ventilation for more than 24 hours postoperatively)
by receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis, with an area under
the ROC curve of 0.95. IL-8 levels at 2 hours had excellent
predictive value for prolonged mechanical ventilation in all
patients. Serum IL-18 levels were not different between those
with and without AKI.
Conclusions Serum IL-6 and IL-8 values identify AKI early in
patients undergoing CPB surgery. Furthermore, among patients
with AKI, high IL-6 levels are associated with prolonged
mechanical ventilation, suggesting that circulating cytokines in
patients with AKI may have deleterious effects on other organs,
including the lungs.
Introduction
Acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized patients is associated
with unacceptably high mortality rates (in the range of 30% to
50% in most recent series for dialysis-requiring AKI) [1,2]. In
addition, the costs associated with AKI are high, as AKI trans￾lates into longer lengths of stay as well as a frequent need for
invasive procedures (e.g., line placement and dialysis).
At present, therapies for AKI are limited to supportive care,
such as dialysis. A number of major impediments exist to
developing therapies for AKI. First, biomarkers that diagnose
AKI: acute kidney injury; CPB: cardiopulmonary bypass; ELISA: enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay; G-CSF: granulocyte colony-stimulating fac￾tor; GM-CSF: granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; IFN: interferon; IL: interleukin; ROC: receiver operator curve; TNF-: tumor necrosis 
factor-.

AKI before an increase in serum creatinine are needed
(reviewed in [3,4]). Because serum creatinine is a marker of
glomerular filtration rate and therefore of established AKI, sub￾stantial kidney injury may have occurred by the time serum cre￾atinine increases. Second, the pathogenesis of AKI in humans
is complex and involves the endothelial and epithelial cell com￾partments, as well as inflammatory cells. Finally, AKI may have
a detrimental impact on other organs, particularly the lung [5-
7]. Predicting distant organ injury is critical to developing bet￾ter therapies for AKI, because other end-organ injury may be a
major mechanism for morbidity and mortality related to AKI.
AKI is associated with inflammation. In patients with estab￾lished AKI, serum interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-1, IL-10 and tumor
necrosis factor- (TNF-), were increased [8]. In an animal
model of AKI, we demonstrated that inflammatory cytokines
increase early after AKI as serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) and kerat￾inocyte-derived cytokine (KC, the murine analogue of inter￾leukin-8) were increased by 2 hours after AKI [9]. Whether
these and other cytokines might be early biomarkers of AKI in
patients, and whether these biomarkers would predict other
adverse outcomes in patients with AKI are unknown. To test
whether serum cytokines might be early biomarkers of AKI, we
examined serum IL-1, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, IL-18, inter￾feron (IFN)-, TNF-, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G￾CSF), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(GM-CSF) in pediatric patients with and without AKI, 2, 12,
and 24 hours after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Based on
our animal data, we hypothesized that IL-6 and IL-8 would be
early biomarkers of acute kidney injury.
In animals, we and others demonstrated that AKI causes lung
injury, characterized by neutrophil infiltration and increased
capillary permeability [6,9-14]. Furthermore, we recently dem￾onstrated that IL-6 mediates lung injury after both ischemic
AKI and bilateral nephrectomy, and that this effect may be
dependent on KC (the murine analogue of IL-8) [15]. There￾fore, we also hypothesized that early biomarkers of AKI (e.g.,
IL-6 and IL-8) would predict the need for prolonged mechani￾cal ventilation in this study.
Materials and methods
Study subjects
All children undergoing correction of congenital heart disease
at Cincinnati Children's Hospital between January 2004 and
November 2004 were eligible. Exclusion criteria included pre￾existing renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascu￾lar disease, and use of nephrotoxic drugs before or during the
study period. Written informed consent was obtained from the
legal guardian of each child; the study was approved by the
Cincinnati Children's Hospital Institutional Review Board. This
study population was previously described in detail [16,17].
As part of standard management, children were treated with a
one-time dose of 30 mg/kg methylprednisolone on the CPB
pump, with a maximum dose of 500 mg. All of the children
received modified ultrafiltration per protocol at the end of sur￾gery. All study subjects received intravenous fluids per a
standard protocol (80% of maintenance fluids on postopera￾tive day 1 and 100% of maintenance fluids on subsequent
postoperative days). None of the patients had oliguria. Wean￾ing from mechanical ventilation and extubation occurred per
protocol.
Study procedures
Serum creatinine was measured at baseline and at least twice
a day postoperatively and at least daily after postoperative day
3. Blood samples were collected at baseline and at 2, 12, and
24 hours after the initiation of CPB, and then once daily for 5
days. When the CPB time was less than 2 hours, the first post￾operative serum samples were obtained at the end of CPB,
and this sample was considered the 2-hour sample. The pri￾mary outcome variable was development of AKI, defined as a
50% or greater increase in serum creatinine from baseline
within 3 days. Other variables obtained included age, sex, eth￾nic origin, CPB time, previous heart surgery, urine output, and
duration of mechanical ventilation.
Statistical analysis
Baseline characteristics and cytokine levels of subjects who
did and did not develop acute kidney injury were compared.
Categoric variables were expressed as proportions and com￾pared by using the 2 test. Continuous variables were
expressed as mean ± standard deviation or median with inter￾quartile range and were compared by using Student's t test or
the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, where appropriate.
We next examined the association between biomarker meas￾urements (predictor) and acute kidney injury or prolonged
mechanical ventilation (outcomes), by using multivariable
logistic regression to adjust for other covariates. Biomarker
levels were log transformed because these were not normally
distributed. We adjusted for age, sex, race, and operative
characteristics. Model discrimination was assessed using
ROC curves [18]. Model fit (calibration) was assessed using
the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test, which compares
model performance (observed vs. expected) across deciles of
risk. A nonsignificant value for the Hosmer-Lemeshow 2 sug￾gests an absence of biased fit. Data analysis was conducted
by using Stata 10 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). A P
value of less than 0.20 was considered potentially significant
for interaction. In other cases, two-tailed P values less than
0.05 were considered significant.
Flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunoassay 
(ELISA) determination for serum cytokines
Serum IL-1, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, IFN-, TNF-, G￾CSF, and GM-CSF were measured in duplicate using a bead￾based multiplex cytokine kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) in
conjunction with flow-based protein detection and the
Luminex LabMAP multiplex system (Luminex, Austin, TX, USA)

according to the manufacturers' directions. The detection limit
for each cytokine was 1.95 pg/ml. To confirm results obtained
with the multiplex cytokine array, serum IL-6 and IL-8 were
measured in duplicate by the appropriate single ELISA (R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The lower limit of detection
for IL-6 is less than 0.7 pg/ml, and the detection limit for IL-8
is 1.5 to 7.5 pg/ml. Serum IL-18 was measured in duplicate by
single ELISA (Medical and Biologic Laboratories, Nagoya,
Japan); the detection limit for IL-18 is 25 pg/ml.
Results
Patient characteristics
This was a nested case-control study of a cohort of children
undergoing CPB for correction of congenital heart disease.
The cohort of patients was previously described and consists
of patients with clear ischemic acute kidney injury due to CPB
[16,17]. In brief, 100 consecutive children undergoing CPB
surgery were considered for study; 29 were excluded for
nephrotoxin use. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was defined by a
50% or greater increase in serum creatinine within a 3-day
postoperative period. Of the 71 eligible study subjects, AKI
developed in 20 patients. Eighteen of the AKI subjects had
sufficient serum remaining for analysis of cytokines; 21 con￾trols were selected from the patients without AKI.
No differences were found between subjects in whom AKI
developed and those in whom it did not with regard to age,
sex, ethnicity, or baseline creatinine (Table 1). AKI was associ￾ated with longer CPB times (P = 0.0005). A strong associa￾tion was noted between AKI and the need for prolonged
mechanical ventilation, defined as ventilation for more than 24
postoperative hours (P = 0.009). Cardiac surgical procedures
in children with and without AKI are detailed in Additional data
file # 1.
Serum cytokine levels and AKI
Serum IL-1, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, IFN-, TNF-, G￾CSF, and GM-CSF were measured at baseline (before CPB)
and at 2, 12, and 24 hours after CPB with a multiplex protein￾detection method. Compared with AKI-free controls, patients
with AKI had significantly increased serum IL-6 and IL-8 levels.
No significant differences were observed for IL-1, IL-5, IL-10,
IL-17, IFN-, TNF-, G-CSF, or GM-CSF at any time point
(data not shown). Serum IL-18, as measured with ELISA, was
also not different between patients with versus those without
AKI.
As shown in Figure 1, levels of IL-6 and IL-8 by single-analyte
ELISA were not different at the time of CPB between children
in whom AKI developed and those in whom it did not. IL-6 and
IL-8 levels peaked in both groups at 2 hours after CPB. IL-6
levels were significantly higher in children with AKI at 2 and 12
hours, compared with those without AKI. IL-8 levels were sig￾nificantly higher in children with AKI at 2, 12, and 24 hours
after CPB.
In bivariate analysis, IL-6 and IL-8 levels at 2 and 12 hours
were independently associated with the development of acute
kidney injury (Table 2). After adjustment for age, sex, race, and
whether the patient had previous surgery, IL-6 levels at 2 hours
and IL-8 levels at 2 and 12 hours remained predictive for AKI.
Because prolonged CPB time is a known risk factor for AKI,

and because we hypothesized that high inflammatory cytokine
levels are the result of AKI, we specifically chose not to adjust
for CPB time in our multivariable model. Alternatively, one of
the pathogenetic mechanisms for AKI after CPB is through
inflammatory processes mediated by IL-6 and IL-8; thus,
cytokine levels and CPB time would not be expected to have
independent predictive value in a model for AKI. Similarly,
because IL-6 and IL-8 likely represent a common inflammatory
pathway, we did not adjust for both cytokines in the same pre￾dictive model. Last, we examined the performance of various
cut points in cytokine levels for the diagnosis of AKI (Table 3).
Serum cytokine levels and mechanical ventilation
We next compared cytokine levels between children who
required prolonged mechanical ventilation, defined as ventila￾tion for more than 24 postoperative hours, and those who did
not. Median IL-6 levels at 2 hours after CPB were significantly
higher in children who required prolonged mechanical ventila￾tion, compared with those who did not (171 pg/ml [25% to
75% IQR 106.2, 270.3] vs. 85.3 pg/ml [41.8, 118.2], P =
0.005; Figure 2). Similarly, IL-8 levels at 2 hours after CPB
were significantly higher in children who required prolonged
mechanical ventilation (92.2 pg/ml [72.1, 288.7] vs. 31.3 pg/
ml [19.7, 58.6], P = 0.0001). IL-6 and IL-8 levels also differed
significantly between the two groups at 12 and 24 hours (data
not shown).

When we analyzed the association between cytokine levels
and the requirement for prolonged mechanical ventilation, an
interaction between IL-6 levels and acute kidney injury was
detected (P = 0.06). An interaction was not detected between
IL-8 levels and acute kidney injury (P = 0.83). We therefore
stratified the analysis of IL-6 levels by the presence or absence
of AKI. IL-6 levels were associated with prolonged mechanical
ventilation only in study subjects with acute kidney injury (P =
0.008 vs. P = 0.9 in those without AKI). Indeed, IL-6 levels at
2 hours had excellent predictive value for prolonged mechani￾cal ventilation in patients with AKI, with an area under the ROC
curve of 0.95 (Figure 3). IL-8 levels at 2 hours had excellent
predictive value for prolonged mechanical ventilation in all
patients, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.89 (Figure 4).
Discussion
In the present study, we have demonstrated that, in children
undergoing CPB, AKI is characterized by high levels of serum
IL-6 and IL-8. IL-6 and IL-8 levels at 2 and 12 hours after CPB
were predictive for subsequent AKI. Furthermore, among chil￾dren with AKI, early increases in serum IL-6 are predictive of
prolonged mechanical ventilation.
We previously demonstrated in animal models that early AKI is
characterized by high serum IL-6 and IL-8 [9]. Our study is the
first in patients to suggest that early AKI (i.e., within 2 hours of
the original insult) is a proinflammatory state. Whereas other
studies have demonstrated that increased serum IL-6 predicts
subsequent AKI [19,20], these studies were conducted in crit￾ically ill patients with severe sepsis and acute lung injury. In
those studies, the timing of the underlying AKI insult was less
clear because of the underlying severity of illness of study sub￾jects. IL-6 was elevated between 1 and 7 days before the
detection of AKI, so the timing of the IL-6 elevation relative to
AKI was also less clear. Thus, AKI may have contributed to
high levels of IL-6, or may have been the result of the patient's
proinflammatory state.
In our study, patients were children undergoing CPB, in which
the major insult is the surgery and bypass itself. Thus, the tim￾ing of the insult is clear. Based on our animal studies, we
hypothesized that levels of proinflammatory cytokines would
increase early after the ischemic insult (e.g., CPB). Indeed, lev￾els of IL-6 and IL-8 were elevated 2 hours after CPB in patients
with AKI, well before a detectable increase in creatinine. These
results are similar to those observed with other urine and
plasma biomarkers of AKI that have been measured in this
cohort, including urinary IL-18, serum/urinary neutrophil-gelati￾nase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), urinary kidney injury mole￾Table 3

cule-1 (KIM-1), and urinary liver fatty acid-binding protein (L￾FABP) [16,17,21,22].
Although CPB is associated with an increase in proinflamma￾tory cytokines [23], data are accumulating that AKI may affect
both the production and clearance of cytokines. For example,
in animal models of ischemic AKI, increased renal production
of both IL-6 and KC (the murine analogue of IL-8) have been
documented [9,24,25]. Increased serum cytokines also are
detected after bilateral nephrectomy [9], a model of renal fail￾ure in which both kidneys are removed, and therefore, the kid￾ney cannot be a source of increased serum cytokines in this
model. Thus, extrarenal production of cytokines or impaired
clearance of cytokines may also occur in acute renal failure
and contribute to elevated serum levels. In this regard, phar￾macokinetic studies in animals demonstrated that the kidney
plays a key role in the clearance of cytokines [26-28]. In
patients, a negative correlation has been demonstrated
between serum IL-6 levels and glomerular filtration rate [29],
further implicating the kidney in cytokine clearance. Available
evidence suggests that cytokines are cleared by the kidney
predominantly through filtration, resorption, and metabolism by
the proximal tubule [30], although filtration and excretion of the
intact protein can occur [9]. In our study, concomitant AKI
resulted in a greater than threefold increase in serum IL-6 and
IL-8 2 hours after CPB versus CPB alone. Thus, although
serum cytokines increase after CPB itself, the increase is
much greater in the presence of AKI and may be due to
decreased clearance or increased production or both.
Mechanical ventilation is a consistent, independent predictor
of mortality in patients with AKI [31-35], and a recent study
demonstrated that patients with AKI required mechanical ven￾tilation for more days than did patients with similar severity of
illness who did not have AKI [36]. The reasons for the pro￾longed duration of mechanical ventilation in patients with AKI
is unknown. In mice, IL-6 signalling effects are increased in the
lung after AKI [37], and our recently published data demon￾strate that IL-6 mediates lung injury after AKI, as IL-6-deficient
and IL-6 antibody-treated mice had reduced lung inflamma￾tion, capillary leak, and serum and lung KC after AKI [15].

mechanical ventilation in patients with AKI after CPB.

Although the role of IL-6 in other forms of lung injury has not
been examined, a pathogenic role of IL-6 in ventilator-associ￾ated lung injury has been hypothesized [38]; patients receiving
lung-protective ventilation (6 ml/kg tidal volume) had lower
serum IL-6 levels, which predicted reduced mortality and more
ventilator-free days versus patients receiving standard ventila￾tion (12 ml/kg tidal volume) [39]. In the present study, we dem￾onstrate that in patients with AKI, increased serum IL-6 2
hours after CPB was predictive for prolonged mechanical ven￾tilation. Recognizing that we are unable to prove causality in
this context, we hypothesize that AKI directly contributes to
prolonged mechanical ventilation, perhaps through higher lev￾els of IL-6 leading to increased inflammation and lung injury.
Thus, IL-6 may be both a diagnostic marker of AKI and pro￾longed mechanical ventilation, as well as a potential therapeu￾tic target.
Our study has several strengths. As stated previously, our
study subjects were children undergoing CPB surgery. There￾fore, the timing of the increase in IL-6 and IL-8 levels relative to
the ischemic insult is clear and, as in our animal models,
occurs early after injury. Furthermore, this is a well-character￾ized cohort of children, in whom other plasma and urine
biomarkers of AKI have been shown to have excellent predic￾tive value. Our study also has some limitations. Because this is
a clinical study, our results are associations and cannot prove
causality. However, our results are similar to our prior observa￾tions in animal models [9] and suggest that AKI may affect
other end organs in human disease through its effects on sys￾temic cytokines. The study population is relatively small and
made up of children undergoing CPB, so the generalizability of
these results to other populations is unclear. However, given
their lack of other comorbidities, this pediatric population has
been invaluable for studies of ischemic AKI unconfounded by
other diseases that could contribute to a proinflammatory state
(e.g., sepsis). Further studies in critically ill adult populations
are warranted to confirm and extend our findings; however,
these studies are likely to be confounded by the contribution
of other disease states to systemic cytokine levels.
Conclusions
We have shown that serum IL-6 and IL-8 levels increase early
after CPB and are predictive of AKI in a pediatric population.
Based on data from animal models in which AKI itself leads to
elevated IL-6 and IL-8 levels, we hypothesize that the increase
in IL-6 and IL-8 is because of increased cytokine generation or
reduced cytokine clearance in the setting of AKI. Furthermore,
among patients with AKI, IL-6 levels are predictive of pro￾longed mechanical ventilation. This result is similar to our prior
results in animal models, in which AKI resulted in higher serum
IL-6 levels and concomitant lung injury. Thus, serum cytokines
may have an important role as early biomarkers for AKI, as well
as a potential role as a therapeutic target in AKI. Modulation of
these cytokines may reduce the degree of kidney injury itself,
as well as the deleterious effects of kidney injury on other end
organs, including the lung.
Competing interests
KDL, CA, GS, CDK and SF have no competing interests to
disclose. CE holds US Patent 7,141,382 for IL-18 as an early
biomarker of AKI. PD is on the Advisory Board of Abbott Diag￾nostics and Biosite, Inc., and has licensing agreements with
Abbott and Biosite for developing NGAL as a biomarker for
acute renal failure.
Authors' contributions
KDL performed the statistical analysis and drafted the manu￾script. CA carried out biomarker measurements. GS per￾formed the initial statistical analysis. CE was responsible for
the serum IL-18 analyses and participated in the design of the
study. CDK was responsible for recruiting the patients, obtain￾ing the samples, and maintaining the clinical database. PD
designed and carried out the original cohort study of children
Figure 4
Receiver-operator characte predict prolonged mechan (CPB) Receiver-operator characteical ventilation after cardiopulmonary bypass ristic (ROC) curve for ristic (ROC) curve for the ability of IL-8 to the ability of IL-8 to 
predict prolonged mechanical ventilation after cardiopulmonary bypass 
(CPB). Prolonged mechanical ventilation was defined as more than 24 
hours of ventilation. Interleukin-8 levels were log-transformed because 
they were abnormally distributed. The area under the ROC curve is 
0.89, with a Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit P value of 0.75, dem￾onstrating that increased serum IL-8 at 2 hours is an excellent predictor 
of prolonged mechanical ventilation in patients after CPB.
Key messages
• The proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 are 
increased early (at 2 hours) in patients with AKI due to 
CPB.
• Other serum cytokines, including IL-18, are not 
increased in patients with AKI.
• Among patients with AKI, serum IL-6 predicts pro￾longed mechanical ventilation.
• Serum IL-6 and IL-8 may be useful early biomarkers to 
detect AKI and predict complications (i.e., prolonged 
mechanical ventilation).
