Abstract
Background: Guidelines recommend inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)
as maintenance treatment for patients with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) with a post-bronchodilator forced
expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) <50% predicted and
frequent exacerbations, although they have only a small preventive
effect on the accelerated decline in lung function. Combined
treatment with ICS and long acting β2 agonists (LABA) may provide


benefit to the stability of COPD, but it is unknown if withdrawal of
ICS will result in disease deterioration.
Methods: The effects of 1 year withdrawal of the ICS fluticasone
propionate (FP) after a 3 month run-in treatment period with FP
combined with the LABA salmeterol (S) (500 μg FP + 50 μg S twice
daily; SFC) were investigated in patients with COPD in a
randomised, double blind study. 497 patients were enrolled from 39
centres throughout the Netherlands; 373 were randomised and 293
completed the study.
Results: The drop out rate after randomisation was similar in the
two groups. Withdrawal of FP resulted in a sustained decrease in
FEV1: mean (SE) change from baseline −4.4 (0.9)% (S) v −0.1
(0.9)% (SFC); adjusted difference 4.1 (95% CI 1.6 to 6.6)
percentage points (p<0.001). Corresponding figures for the FEV1/
FVC ratio were −3.7 (0.8)% (S) v 0.0 (0.8)% (SFC) (p = 0.002). The
annual moderate to severe exacerbation rate was 1.6 and 1.3 in the
S and SFC groups, respectively (adjusted rate ratio 1.2; 95% CI 0.9
to 1.5; p = 0.15). The mean annual incidence rate of mild
exacerbations was 1.3 (S) v 0.6 (SFC), p = 0.020. An immediate and
sustained increase in dyspnoea score (scale 0–4; mean difference
between groups 0.17 (0.04), p<0.001) and in the percentage of
disturbed nights (6 (2) percentage points, p<0.001) occurred after
withdrawal of fluticasone.
Conclusions: Withdrawal of FP in COPD patients using SFC
resulted in acute and persistent deterioration in lung function and
dyspnoea and in an increase in mild exacerbations and percentage
of disturbed nights. This study clearly indicates a key role for ICS in
the management of COPD as their discontinuation leads to disease
deterioration, even under treatment with a LABA.
