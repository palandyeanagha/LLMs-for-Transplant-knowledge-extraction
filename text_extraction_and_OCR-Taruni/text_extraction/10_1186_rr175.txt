Introduction
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), also referred to as
cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, is a chronic, progressive
and usually lethal lung disorder of unknown etiology. The
disease occurs predominantly from middle age onwards,
with more than two-thirds of patients being over 60 years
old at the time of presentation. Men are nearly twice as
likely as women to suffer from IPF [1].
Similar to other interstitial lung diseases, IPF has been
considered for a long time as the deleterious conse￾quence of an unresolved chronic inflammatory process
that follows an unrecognized insult. Examining our knowl￾edge in perspective, however, there is little evidence to
sustain this hypothesis.
It is certain that most interstitial lung diseases include an
identifiable initial inflammatory response to an unknown
(for example, sarcoidosis and desquamative interstitial
pneumonia) or known (for example, hypersensitivity pneu￾monitis and drugs) damaging agent. In all these disorders,
lung biopsy in early disease shows pure inflammation and,
on follow-up, many of these patients improve or heal with
anti-inflammatory therapy. A number of these disorders
may naturally evolve to fibrosis and thus can often be diffi￾cult to differentiate from an IPF lung; for example, patients
in the late stages of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis
also present severe fibrosis and honeycombing [2].
By contrast, no one (or almost no one) seems to have
seen an early phase of a true IPF, and the histology of
patients presenting with IPF, both at 6 months and at
2 years after the beginning of symptoms, shows variable
degrees of fibrosis and honeycombing with mild to mod￾erate inflammation. In other words, there is no evidence
that IPF starts with an inflammatory process and, most
importantly, there is no evidence, other than parallelisms
with other interstitial lung disorders, to support the
concept that inflammation is more prominent in the early
stages of IPF. In addition, most patients with IPF do not

Abstract
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic and usually progressive lung disorder of unknown etiology. A
growing body of evidence suggests that, in contrast to other interstitial lung diseases, IPF is a distinct
entity in which inflammation is a secondary and non-relevant pathogenic partner. Evidence includes the
presence of similar mild/moderate inflammation either in early or late disease, and the lack of response
to potent anti-inflammatory therapy. Additionally, it is clear from experimental models and some human
diseases that it is possible to have fibrosis without inflammation. An evolving hypothesis proposes that
IPF may result from epithelial micro-injuries and abnormal wound healing.

respond to anti-inflammatory drugs, and the use of corti￾costeroids with or without immunosuppressive drugs
only helps in a few cases, and then only produces a tran￾sient improvement without beneficial effects in the long
term. In fact, survival curves for IPF are worse than for
many cancers, with a median survival of 3–4 years after
diagnosis [3,4].
It has been suggested that IPF is characterized by a
sequence of events that start with alveolar epithelial micro￾injuries followed by the formation of fibroblastic foci and
result in an exaggerated deposition of extracellular matrix,
which drives the destruction of the lung parenchyma archi￾tecture [5,6].
In this context, we propose that there are two routes (at
least) for developing diffuse pulmonary fibrosis. One of
these is the ‘inflammatory route’, which is represented by
almost all the non-IPF interstitial lung diseases where
there is an early, clearly distinguishable phase of alveolitis
and a late fibrotic phase. The other is the ‘epithelial/fibrob￾lastic route’, which is represented by IPF.
It is important to emphasize here that the bleomycin
model, the most used experimental model of lung fibro￾sis, is a paradigm of the inflammatory route. Animals sac￾rificed at early stages (i.e., 3 days post-instillation) show
virtually inflammation only, but after a time (i.e.,
14–21 days post-instillation) they show both inflamma￾tion and fibrosis. Furthermore, it has been reported
recently that in the chronic stages, at least in rats, the
model does not behave as a restrictive syndrome and
the main histological features consist of focal peribron￾chiolar inflammation and fibrosis associated with paraci￾catricial emphysematous changes [7].
Accordingly, there are no appropriate experimental models
of IPF, not only because we do not know its etiology, but
also because all the traditional models start with an inflam￾matory reaction.
Some light emerging from the new
histopathological classification of idiopathic
interstitial pneumonias
During the past decade, it became increasingly evident
that the term ‘idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis’ was impre￾cisely applied to a heterogeneous group of several distinct
forms of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, including usual
interstitial pneumonia (UIP), desquamative interstitial
pneumonia, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, and acute
interstitial pneumonia. Moreover, it was also clear that the
histopathological findings in a number of patients with
idiopathic interstitial pneumonias did not fit into any
defined pattern, and in 1994, Katzenstein and Fiorelli [6]
introduced the concept of nonspecific interstitial pneumo￾nia for such lung biopsies.
Now it is widely accepted that the definite diagnosis of
IPF requires a compatible clinical history and a surgical
lung biopsy showing histological features of UIP. The
latter is essential because we know that while other idio￾pathic interstitial pneumonias may improve or even heal
after treatment, IPF/UIP is habitually progressive. As men￾tioned for chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, however,
patients with a fibrotic or mixed cellular/fibrotic pattern of
nonspecific interstitial pneumonia may also display a poor
outcome [8].
An important concept regarding the possible role of alve￾olitis in the pathogenesis of IPF arises from this new clas￾sification. A careful review of the UIP lung has
demonstrated that the inflammatory component is usually
mild, occurs mainly in areas of collagen deposition or hon￾eycomb change, and rarely involves otherwise unaltered
alveolar septa [9]. There is little evidence to support the
concept that inflammation is a prominent feature at any
stage of the disease and moreover, severe inflammation
should lead the clinician/pathologist to consider a diagno￾sis other than UIP.
In this sense, it is remarkable that we have been unable to
clearly define the early changes in IPF/UIP. Actually, early
and late IPF/UIP histology is the same, with a temporal het￾erogeneous combination of normal alveoli, some inflamma￾tion, fibroblastic foci, extracellular matrix accumulation and
honeycombing. It is likely that this characteristic variegated
temporal appearance of UIP reflects the repetitive occur￾rence over time of microscopic foci of lung injury and
repair. In addition, a recent review of the Denver experience
demonstrated that neither inflammation nor fibrosis corre￾lates with survival. Interestingly enough, the only pathologi￾cal data that showed a significant correlation with mortality
were numbers of areas with fibroblastic foci [10].
An unsolved question in IPF/UIP is when alveolitis shows
up during the development of the disease; our contention
is that inflammation may appear only after the formation of
fibroblastic foci.
Is it possible to have a fibrotic response in
non-inflammatory processes?
Explants of mouse lungs cultured in a free-blood environ￾ment at various stages after hyperoxic injury have demon￾strated that as alveolar damage, particularly of type 1
pneumocytes, increases, epithelial cell proliferation slackens
while fibroblast growth becomes predominant [11]. In these
explants, an increase in collagen synthesis and deposition
was also noticed. Importantly, when the hyperoxic injury
involved only the endothelial cells, no association with fibro￾sis was observed. We can learn two lessons from this
model. First, as the fibrotic changes occurred in the pres￾ence of few macrophages, and in the absence of inflamma￾tory cells from the systemic circulation, these findings

Page 3 of 8

clearly suggest that it is possible to have a fibrotic reaction
without inflammation. Second, epithelial cell damage and
perturbation of epithelial–fibroblast interactions is sufficient
to promote the development of a fibrotic process.
A non-inflammatory fibrotic response in humans is pro￾voked by chronic overuse of tendons. The lesion is fre￾quently called tendinitis. A common example is the tennis
elbow or lateral epicondylitis. Histopathological studies
have shown, however, that this lesion contains few inflam￾matory cells [12], and suggest that chronic refractory
lateral epicondylitis is a degenerative rather than an inflam￾matory condition. This may account for its lack of
response to anti-inflammatory medication. By contrast,
tendonitis, which usually occurs after acute tendon
injuries, is characterized by the presence of an increased
number of lymphocytes and neutrophils. In this context, it
has recently been proposed that tennis elbow lesion rep￾resents a fibroblastic and vascular response (angiofibrob￾lastic degeneration) to repetitive microtrauma and is now
more commonly known as tendinosis [13]. The histopatho￾logical features represent a non-inflammatory, degenera￾tive process associated with fibroblastic hyperplasia and
the accumulation of disorganized and immature collagen.
What is IPF if not an inflammatory disorder?
We propose that IPF is, from the earliest stage, an epithe￾lial-fibroblastic disease, that is, a fibroproliferative disorder
preceded by alveolar epithelial cell activation. It is becom￾ing apparent that the primary sites of ongoing injury and
repair are the regions of fibroblastic proliferation, so-called
fibroblastic foci [9,14]. These small aggregates of actively
proliferating fibroblasts/myofibroblasts constitute multiple,
microscopic sites of ongoing alveolar epithelial injury and
activation associated with evolving fibrosis (Fig. 1). In
other words, we postulate that in IPF, an initial epithelial
cell injury and activation induces fibroblast migration/pro￾liferation and fibroblast phenotypic change (myofibrob￾lasts). Subsequently, myofibroblasts may provoke
basement membrane disruption and alveolar epithelial cell
apoptosis, perpetuating the damage and avoiding appro￾priate re-epithelialization. The final result is the excessive
deposition of extracellular matrix with the destruction of
the alveolar-capillary units and the formation of cystic
fibrotic spaces or honeycombing (Fig. 2).
The alveolar epithelial cell connection
IPF lungs exhibit noteworthy changes in alveolar epithe￾lium. These include the presence of cuboidal cells (hyper￾plasia of type 2 pneumocytes), reactive large and
elongated epithelial cells (transitional cells among type 2
and type 1 pneumocytes?), microscopic areas of epithelial
cell dropout, and bronchiolar epithelium lining areas of
honeycomb lesions. In general terms, it seems that in
IPF/UIP, the ability of type 2 alveolar cells to restore
damaged type 1 cells is seriously affected [15].
Importantly, altered alveolar type 2 cells synthesize a
variety of enzymes, such as matrix metalloproteinases,
cytokines and growth factors, suggesting that the contri￾bution of the epithelium in the extracellular matrix remodel￾ing is greater than commonly thought. In fact, during the
development of IPF, alveolar epithelial cells appear to be
responsible for the expression and release of most, if not
all, the profibrotic cytokines and growth factors that have
usually been associated with inflammatory cells, primarily
alveolar macrophages.
Thus, for example, Kapanci et al. [16] examined lung
biopsy specimens from a number of IPF patients and
demonstrated that type 2 alveolar epithelial cells consti￾tute the main site of synthesis of transforming growth
factor (TGF)-β1 and tumor necrosis factor-α. They also
seemed to be closely related to the presence of myofi￾broblastic foci. Similar results were obtained by Nash et
al. [17], who detected a widespread tumor necrosis
factor-α staining of epithelial cells, particularly hyperplastic
type 2 pneumocytes, while macrophages stained only
weakly. Khalil et al. [18,19] also found that in IPF, TGF-β is
located in alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells. In
particular, epithelial cells of honeycomb cysts and hyper￾plastic type 2 pneumocytes stained intensely. TGF-β was
also localized in subepithelial regions of honeycomb cysts
in areas of dense fibroconnective tissue deposition.
Other growth factors besides TGF-β and tumor necrosis
factor-α have been found to be expressed by epithelial

cells in IPF. For example, we have found using immunoflu￾orescence and in situ hybridization that the main cells
expressing platelet-derived growth factor were alveolar
epithelial cells [20]. However, the contribution of other
cells, both inflammatory and resident, to the cytokine
milieu during the development of IPF can not currently be
ruled out.
The fibroblast connection
The earliest and probably the only morphological change
associated with progression to fibrosis is the presence of
fibroblastic foci (Fig. 1). A focus of fibroblasts is character￾ized by a distinct cluster of fibroblasts/myofibroblasts
within the alveolar wall, with little if any associated inflam￾mation within the foci. Both electron microscopy and
immunohistochemistry have shown that fibroblast foci rep￾resent microscopic zones of acute lung injury in which alve￾olar lining cells are destroyed and the epithelial basement
membrane is denuded [14,21,22]. The fibroblast prolifera￾tion occurs in an attempt to repair the damaged alveolus,
and is followed by extracellular matrix accumulation. As
mentioned, in these foci, scattered mononuclear inflamma￾tory cells may accompany the process, but neither intersti￾tial nor intraluminal inflammation are major features.
Fibroblastic foci may occur in the interstitial (subepithelial)
space or in the alveolar spaces, which are later covered by
reactive epithelium [9,21,22]. In the later stages of fibro￾sis, epithelial basement membranes are frequently wavy
and disrupted, and fibroblasts migrate through gaps in the
epithelial basement membranes and continue proliferating
and producing extracellular matrix in the alveolar spaces.
Chronicle of a foretold programmed cell death: alveolar
epithelial cells versus fibroblasts
During normal skin wound healing, epithelial cells move
quickly across the wound defect to re-establish the cuta￾neous cover. During the subsequent process of tissue
repair, fibroblasts move into the wound space where they
transform into myofibroblasts that contract the wound and
construct new extracellular matrix. After that, programmed
cell death has been proposed to mediate the decrease of
mesenchymal cells. Finally, epidermal cells differentiate to
re-establish the permeability barrier.
In a similar way, the complex process of normal lung repair
after injury requires the collaborative efforts of several cell
lineages and should include, on the one hand, epithelial
cell migration, proliferation and differentiation, and on the
other, fibroblast migration and proliferation, their transfor￾mation into myofibroblasts, and myofibroblast apoptosis.
In progressive fibrotic disorders including IPF, however,
current evidence suggests that the opposite situation
occurs, such that increased and continuous epithelial cell
apoptosis and decreased fibroblast/myofibroblast apopto￾sis take place.

Figure 2
Hypothetical scheme of the main pathogenic events in IPF/UIP. Unknown insults provoke multiple microscopic foci of epithelial damage and
stimulation. Activated alveolar epithelial cells release factors inducing fibroblast migration and proliferation and changes in cell phenotype. In the
microenvironment of the lesion, myofibroblasts can induce epithelial cell apoptosis and basement membrane disruption, thus contributing to
abnormal re-epithelialization and perpetuation of a vicious circle. Finally, fibroblasts/myofibroblasts secrete excessive amounts of extracellular matrix
components and a disequilibrium between MMPs and TIMPs means that matrix degradation does not occur. The final result is an aberrant
remodeling of the lung parenchyma.
FIBROBLAST ACTIVATION

A number of studies performed both in vitro and in vivo
support the notion that epithelial programmed cell death
and necrosis are highly increased in IPF lungs. For
example, we have demonstrated that altered fibroblasts
emerging during fibrotic lung injury in IPF release
angiotensin peptides and perhaps other soluble factors
capable of inducing programmed cell death and net loss
of alveolar epithelial cells [23,24]. Likewise, fibrotic human
lungs exhibited increased in situ end labeling of frag￾mented DNA in the alveolar epithelium, which appears to
be most concentrated immediately adjacent to underlying
foci of myofibroblasts [25]. Both electron microscopy and
picrosirius red confirmed the presence of epithelial cell
apoptosis, necrosis and cell loss adjacent to foci of colla￾gen accumulation surrounding fibroblast-like cells. More
recently, it was reported that apoptosis of type II pneumo￾cytes also occurred in the normal alveoli of most of
IPF/UIP patients, whereas it was absent in the control
lungs [26].
IPF lungs also exhibit upregulated Fas expression in bron￾chiolar and alveolar epithelial cells, suggesting that the
Fas–Fas ligand pathway may also be involved [27]. More￾over, it was recently reported that the immunoreactivity for
the Fas-associated death domain protein as well as for
caspase-1 and caspase-3 were significantly increased in
alveolar epithelial cells of IPF compared with controls [28].
Furthermore, Fas ligation induced upregulation of
caspase-1 and caspase-3 expression in the nucleus and
cytoplasm of A549 cells. These results strongly suggest
that the Fas signalling pathway is upregulated in lung
epithelial cells during IPF.
These findings together demonstrate that numerous alveo￾lar epithelial cells die during the course of lung fibrosis, and
support the hypothesis that alveolar epithelial cell death is
at least partially induced by abnormal lung fibroblasts.
Keloids represent an abnormal wound healing response
that fails to resolve and leads to formation of a raised colla￾gen mass extending beyond the original wound margins
that rarely regresses. The other type of excessive skin scar￾ring is the hypertrophic scar, which, in contrast to keloids, is
limited to the initial boundaries of the injury and tends to
regress with time [29]. It was recently demonstrated that
keloid-derived fibroblasts, in contrast to hypertrophic scar￾derived and normal skin-derived fibroblasts, are significantly
resistant to both Fas-mediated and staurosporine-induced
apoptosis [30]. Moreover, TGF-β1, a prototype of fibrotic
cytokines, appeared to have a pivotal role in this resistance
to apoptosis [30]. Similarly, fibroblasts obtained from the
superficial and basal regions of keloids showed population
doubling times and saturation densities that were similar to
those of age-matched normal fibroblasts [31]. In contrast,
fibroblasts from the center of the keloid lesions showed a
significantly reduced growth rate [31]. Although apoptotic
cells were detected in both normal and keloid-derived
fibroblasts, their numbers were two-fold lower in all keloid
fibroblasts than in normal cells [31].
The in vivo apoptotic activity during IPF/UIP has also been
clearly detected lower in the fibroblastic foci than in the
fibromyxoid lesions of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia
(a reversible disease), suggesting that fibroblasts/myofi￾broblasts in IPF survive for longer [32]. In contrast, we
have recently found that fibroblasts from IPF lungs in
culture have a lower growth rate than fibroblasts from
normal lungs (the center of keloid lesions show a similarly
reduced growth rate) and exhibit increased spontaneous
apoptosis [33].
These in vitro findings may be explained in two ways. First,
the microenvironment of IPF lungs may include anti-apop￾totic factors that could influence fibroblast behavior in vivo
but which are lost when cells are cultured in vitro.
Second, it is possible that the different subpopulations
selected for culture in vitro and which die by apoptosis are
not those that are resistant to apoptosis in vivo. In this
context, it has recently been reported that some experi￾mental conditions assumed to occur in vivo may lead to
the selection and propagation of certain apoptosis-resis￾tant or apoptosis-susceptible fibroblast subpopulations
[34]. Resistance to apoptosis occurs when cells are stim￾ulated with TGF-β1, and this subpopulation seems to rep￾resent an important part of the systemic sclerosis
fibroblast phenotype [34].
Interestingly, some apparently contradictory results have
been reported concerning lung fibroblast proliferation in
vitro. Thus, some data suggest that human lung fibroblasts
derived from fibrotic tissues proliferate significantly faster
than those obtained from normal lungs [35]. The contra￾diction between these data and ours might be explained
by the observation that higher rates of proliferation occur
in fibroblasts derived from areas of early fibrosis, whereas
lower rates of proliferation occur in cells obtained from
dense fibroses [36].
Coagulation cascade and fibrosis: a pathogenic role for
epithelial cells and fibroblasts
Lung injury leads to vasodilatation, with the subsequent
leakage of plasma proteins into interstitial and alveolar
spaces, activation of the coagulation cascade and deposi￾tion of fibrin. Fibroblasts migrate into this provisional fibrin
matrix where they synthesize extracellular matrix mole￾cules. The key protein involved in fibrin resorption is
plasmin, a proteinase that also has a role in the activation
of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), primarily MMP-1 and
MMP-9 [37,38]. In turn, activation of MMPs provokes
extracellular matrix degradation that, together with fibrin
removal, results in the clearance of the alveolar spaces.
Activated MMP-9 may also enhance epithelial cell migra￾Available online http://respiratory-research.com/content/3/1/3

tion [37], and all of these constitute essential steps in the
restoration of injured tissues to normal.
In contrast, the persistence of fibrin and inappropriate reg￾ulation of plasmin promotes fibrosis. Essentially, the
balance between procoagulant (i.e. tissue factor), fibri￾nolytic (tissue-type and urokinase-type plasminogen acti￾vators) and anti-fibrinolytic (plasminogen activator inhibitor
(PAI)-1 and PAI-2) systems determines whether fibrin will
be deposited or resorbed.
In this context, increased local procoagulant and anti-fibri￾nolytic activities have been found in patients with IPF, sug￾gesting that fibrin matrix removal is slow in them and, as a
consequence, fibroblast migration, extracellular matrix
deposition and the magnitude of the fibrotic response is
increased [39,40]. The levels of tissue factor, PAI-1 and
PAI-2 are significantly elevated in bronchoalveolar lavage
obtained from IPF patients, and the compensatory
increase in tissue factor pathway inhibitor appears to be
insufficient to counterbalance tissue factor, which leads to
a hypercoagulable state in IPF lungs [41].
Importantly for our hypothesis that IPF is an epithelial/
fibroblastic disorder, cuboidal alveolar epithelial cells
appear to be the primary source of these activities. Tissue
factor and PAI-1 and PAI-2 are thus both strongly
expressed by alveolar epithelial cells in IPF lungs [39–41].
Furthermore, it has recently been found that whereas cryp￾togenic organizing pneumonia lesions have an increased
expression of urokinase-type plasminogen activator, espe￾cially in the lining of epithelial cells around the fibroblastic
plugs, the predominant staining in IPF lungs was for PAI-1,
which was also in the epithelial cells lining the enlarged,
restructured airspaces [42].
In addition, fibroblasts might also play a role in excessive
fibrin deposit; it was found recently that dermal fibroblasts
derived from keloid lesions markedly overexpress PAI-1
mRNA transcripts and protein compared to normal skin
fibroblasts. If this finding can be extrapolated to lungs, it
may suggest that lung fibroblasts could also participate in
the synthesis of the major negative physiologic regulator
of plasmin activation and, consequently, in the excessive
alveolar fibrin accumulation [43].
Progressive accumulation of extracellular matrix: a
decisive role for fibroblasts/myofibroblasts
The final result of IPF is an aberrant tissue remodeling,
characterized by excessive deposition of connective tissue
with the consequent progressive destruction of the lung
parenchyma to form fibrotic honeycomb lesions. The mole￾cular mechanisms behind this abnormal remodeling are
poorly understood, but the loss of a regulated turnover
involves, at least in part, two families of proteins: MMPs
and the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs).
Recent evidence suggests that profound changes in MMP
and TIMP expression and localization take place in the IPF
lung microenvironment [44–46]. In general, these studies
demonstrate an upregulation of collagenase-1 (MMP-1)
and both gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9), as well as the
four TIMPs. Location is critical for appropriate function,
however, and, interestingly, MMP-1 is usually seen in alve￾olar epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages, but hardly
in fibroblasts or the extracellular matrix. In contrast, the
inhibitors are strongly expressed and widely distributed
throughout the injured IPF lung. In particular, TIMP-2 is
predominantly expressed by myofibroblasts within the
fibroblastic foci [45,46]. For this reason, it has been pro￾posed that a non-degradative lung microenvironment pre￾vails in IPF, which enhances the progressive accumulation
of fibrillar collagens [46]. Moreover, fibroblasts derived
from IPF lungs express in vitro significantly higher
amounts of TIMPs than fibroblasts from normal lungs,
without differences in collagenase-1 expression [33]. In
addition, myofibroblasts represent an aggressive pheno￾type, being the main subset responsible for fibrillar colla￾gen accumulation [47].
On the other hand, the epithelial expression of MMP-1
raises several questions about what this enzyme is doing
there, relatively far away from where fibrilar collagens are
being deposited. A putative MMP-1 function could be
related to alveolar epithelial cell migration, as has been
proposed for keratinocytes in skin wound healing. In fact,
collagenase-1 is prominently and invariably expressed by
basal keratinocytes at the migratory front in all forms of
cutaneous wounds [48].
A different situation may occur with the over-expression of
gelatinase A and gelatinase B. These MMPs have been
localized, among other cellular sources, in subepithelial
fibroblasts/myofibroblasts, occasionally in areas of
denuded alveolar basement membranes, suggesting that
they may participate in basement membrane disruption.
This pathological process may, on the one hand, con￾tribute to the failure of a correct re-epithelialization and, on
the other, facilitate the migration of fibroblasts/myofibrob￾lasts into the alveolar spaces.
Conclusion
The prevailing dogma regarding the pathogenesis of the
fibrotic lung disorders take as a fact that there is an initial
lung injury that is followed by an inflammatory process and
then by fibroblast proliferation and fibrosis. This notion
assumes that inflammation precedes and drives the fibrotic
response and that it plays a major role in lung fibrogenesis.
This hypothetical concept appears to explain the patho￾genesis of most interstitial lung diseases but not IPF/UIP,
which seems to be an epithelial fibroblastic disease. Dis￾tinguishing fibrosis driven by inflammation from fibrosis

originating as an epithelial/fibroblastic disorder is impor￾tant not just for intellectual accuracy. Appropriate therapy
relies on the correct understanding of the nature of the
response to injury.
