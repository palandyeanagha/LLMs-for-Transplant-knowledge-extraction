Fatal Algaemia in 
Patient with Chronic 
Lymphocytic 
Leukemia
To the Editor: Prototheca spe￾cies are achlorophyllic lower algae, 
ubiquitous in nature, which can cause 
human infections, particularly in im￾munocompromised patients (1). Hu￾man protothecosis is mostly caused by 
P. wickerhamii and P. zopfii. Although 
such infections are infrequent, they 
can manifest themselves clinically 
as cutaneous lesions, olecranon bur￾sitis, and, even more rarely, as dis￾seminated or systemic infections (1). 
These infections occur in severely 
immunocompromised patients, such 
as persons with AIDS, or patients un￾dergoing extensive treatment, such as 
cancer treatment or organ transplanta￾tion (1–4). We describe a fatal case of 
P. wickerhamii algaemia in a patient 
with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
In July 2007, a 79-year-old man, 
who had been monitored since 1993 
for stage C chronic lymphocytic leuke￾mia (5), was hospitalized July 13–20 
for a depressive syndrome with fever, 
asthenia, and weight loss (3 kg over 2 
months). Blood and urinary cultures 
on admission were sterile. The patient 
was hospitalized again on July 30 for 
fever (39°C), anorexia, and diarrhea, 
with ≈7 stools per day. He had lost 10 
kg in 2 weeks. Blood cultures for bac￾teria (in BD Bactec Plus Aerobic/F and 
BD Bactec Lytic Anaerobic/F vials; 
Becton Dickinson, Le Pont de Claix, 
France) and fungi (BD Bactec Mycosis 
IC/F; Becton Dickinson) and stool cul￾tures for bacteria were negative. Blood 
cultures were incubated in a Bactec 
9240 instrument (Becton Dickinson). 
Aspergillus fumigatus was found in a 
bronchoalveolar lavage specimen, but 
no Aspergillus galactomannan antigen 
was detected in blood.
The patient was treated with 
piperacillin-tazobactam, ciprofloxa￾cin, acyclovir, voriconazole, and lop￾eramide. Voriconazole (400 mg/day) 
was used from day 17 to day 27. On 
day 21, Cryptosporidium parvum was 
detected on parasitologic stool exami￾nation. Symptoms persisted on day 
26, with strong asthenia and deteriora￾tion of general state. At that time, the 
leukocyte count was 178 × 109
/L with 
3.56 × 109
/L polymorphonuclear neu￾trophils and 172 × 109
/L lymphocytes. 
Three peripheral blood samples were 
cultured for detection of bacteria and 
fungi. On day 27, septic shock devel￾oped in the patient. A blood culture 
showed an Escherichia coli strain sus￾ceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam, 
aminoglycosides, and quinolones. 
Amikacin was added to the treatment 
regimen. Nonetheless, the patient died 
on day 28.
Two blood cultures for bacteria 
in aerobic vials grew the day of the 
patient’s death, but tests of blood cul￾tures for fungus remained negative. 
After Gram staining, gram-positive 
spherical unicellular organisms were 
observed (Figure). After 48 hours of 
incubation, creamy, yeast-like colo￾nies grew on chocolate agar (bio￾Mérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France), but 
not on Sabouraud agar containing gen￾tamicin and chloramphenicol (Becton 
Dickinson). Microscopy and the API 
20C AUX system (bioMérieux) iden￾tified P. wickerhamii.
Sequencing the 18S rDNA with 
the primers Pw18SF 5′-TCAAAAA
GTCCCGGCTAATCTCGTGC-3′ 
and Pw18SR 5′-CGCTTTCGTGCCT
CAATGTCAGTGTT-3′ confirmed the 
identification. The sequence of the 
amplified product was compared with 
sequences published in the database 
of the National Center for Biotech￾nology Information (Bethesda, MD, 
USA). The most likely identification, 
according to BLAST analysis (www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi), was 
P. wickerhamii.
In vitro susceptibility tests were 
performed by the Etest method (AB 
Biodisk, Solna, Sweden), on RPMI 
agar. P. wickerhamii was found to be

susceptible to amphotericin B and 
posaconazole, with MICs of 0.047 
μg/mL and 0.012 μg/mL, respec￾tively. By contrast, it was resistant 
to fluconazole (MIC>256 μg/mL), 
voriconazole (MIC>32 μg/mL), and 
caspofungin (MIC>32 μg/mL). It was 
also susceptible to gentamicin (MIC = 
0.25 μg/mL) but resistant to amikacin 
(MIC>24 μg/mL).
However, the patient died before 
the algae were detected in the blood 
culture vials. In this case, antifungal 
treatment based on voriconazole use 
was empiric and ineffective. Some 
authors have described a successful 
treatment on localized protothecosis 
with voriconazole (6). Amphotericin 
B currently seems to be most effective 
agent, although the best treatment re￾mains a matter of debate (1,4,7). Al￾though in vitro susceptibility test re￾sults are not necessarily well correlated 
with results obtained in vivo, the low 
MIC of posaconazole reported here 
may be of interest in clinical practice 
(8). In the laboratory, use of selective 
yeast media, such as Sabouraud plus 
gentamicin, or Mycosis IC/F vials for 
blood culture, which contain chloram￾phenicol and tobramycin, may make 
it difficult to detect Prototheca spp.,
which are susceptible to these antimi￾crobial drugs.
In patients with algaemia, Pro￾totheca spp. are often associated with 
bacteria, viruses, or yeasts which 
cause co-infections (1), as in this 
case, in which the alga was associ￾ated with E. coli. This association is 
probably the result of disseminated 
protothecosis in severely immuno￾compromised patients, and the alga 
may cross digestive or cutaneous 
barriers. Reasons for septic shock or 
death are unclear for most associa￾tions of pathogens (2,4). Prototheca
spp. are found in various reservoirs, 
including the environment, animals, 
and food (1). In the case described 
here, the infection may have originat￾ed from a contaminated well used to 
obtain water for the patient’s kitchen 
garden. However, we were unable to 
test this hypothesis.
Disseminated protothecosis is 
currently rare but, due to the algae’s 
ubiquitous nature, increasing use of 
immunosuppressive therapy, and in￾creasing incidence of hematologic ma￾lignancy, Prototheca spp. may emerge 
as opportunistic pathogens. Prototheca
spp. should also be considered as an 
emerging cause of systemic infection 
in immunocompromised patients.
