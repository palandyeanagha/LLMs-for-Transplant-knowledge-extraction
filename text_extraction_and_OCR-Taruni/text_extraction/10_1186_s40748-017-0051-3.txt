Surgical site infections after cesarean
delivery: epidemiology, prevention and
treatment
Tetsuya Kawakita1* and Helain J. Landy2
Abstract
Cesarean delivery (CD) is one of the most common procedures performed in the United States, accounting
for 32% of all deliveries. Postpartum surgical site infection (SSI), wound infection and endometritis is a
major cause of prolonged hospital stay and poses a burden to the health care system. SSIs complicate a
significant number of patients who undergo CD – 2-7% will experience sound infections and 2-16% will
develop endometritis. Many risk factors for SSI have been described. These include maternal factors (such as
tobacco use; limited prenatal care; obesity; corticosteroid use; nulliparity; twin gestations; and previous CD),
intrapartum and operative factors (such as chorioamnionitis; premature rupture of membranes; prolonged
rupture of membranes; prolonged labor, particularly prolonged second stage; large incision length;
subcutaneous tissue thickness > 3 cm; subcutaneous hematoma; lack of antibiotic prophylaxis; emergency
delivery; and excessive blood loss), and obstetrical care on the teaching service of an academic institution.
Effective interventions to decrease surgical site infection include prophylactic antibiotic use (preoperative first
generation cephalosporin and intravenous azithromycin), chlorhexidine skin preparation instead of iodine,
hair removal using clippers instead of razors, vaginal cleansing by povidone-iodine, placental removal by
traction of the umbilical cord instead of by manual removal, suture closure of subcutaneous tissue if the
wound thickness is >2 cm, and skin closure with sutures instead of with staples. Implementation of surgical
bundles in non-obstetric patients has been promising., Creating a similar patient care bundle comprised
evidence-based elements in patients who undergo CD may decrease the incidence of this major
complication. Each hospital has the opportunity to create its own CD surgical bundle to decrease surgical
site infection.

Background
Cesarean delivery (CD) is one of the most common
procedures performed in the United States, account￾ing for 32% of all deliveries [1]. In 2014, nearly 1.3
million CDs were performed [1]. As with all surgical
procedures, CD can be associated with SSIs, including
wound infections and endometritis, as well as being
associated with higher maternal morbidity and mor￾tality with future pregnancies [2–5].
Epidemiology
Wound complications
Wound hematoma, seroma, dehiscence
Wound hematoma and seroma are collections of blood and
serum, respectively. Hematomas are usually due to failure
of primary hemostasis or bleeding diathesis such as anticoa￾gulation therapy. Vigorous coughing or severe hypertension
immediately after surgery may contribute to the formation
of hematoma. Wound hematoma or seroma, described in
2-5% of women after CD can cause wound dehiscence and
act as a nidus for development of wound infection [6, 7].
Wound dehiscence is separation of incision and complicates
2-7% after CD [6, 7].

Wound infection
Wound infection presents with erythema, discharge, and
induration of the incision, complicates 2-7% of patients
and generally develops 4 to 7 days after CD [8–12].
When wound infection develops within 48 h, the offend￾ing organisms usually are groups A or B-hemolytic
Streptococcus. Other common pathogens involved in
wound infections are Ureaplasma urealyticum, Staphylo￾coccus epidermidis, Enterococcus facialis, Staphylococcus
aureus, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis [13, 14].
Necrotizing fasciitis
Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare but serious infection causing
significant morbidity after CD that is characterized by rapid
and progressive necrosis of subcutaneous tissue and fascia
[15]. Necrotizing fasciitis is suspected with severe pain,
crepitus, wooden-hard induration of the subcutaneous
tissues, bullous lesions, skin necrosis or ecchymosis, and
elevated serum creatine kinase level; a hallmark of necrotiz￾ing fasciitis is rapid progression of clinical manifestations
[16–18]. Imaging studies such as computed tomography or
magnetic resonance imaging may show edema extending
along the fascial plane. The diagnosis is confirmed at the
time of repeat surgery. Features suggestive include fascia
that swollen and dull gray in appearance with areas of ne￾crosis, skin necrosis with easy dissection along the fascia, or
presence of gas in the soft tissues.
Type I necrotizing fasciitis results from a polymicrobial
infection involving both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria; type
II necrotizing fasciitis is generally caused by a single organ￾ism, group A streptococcus. In a 1997 study, necrotizing
fasciitis occurred in only 0.18% of women who underwent
CD; the onset occurred between 5 and 17 days following
CD. The authors reported a very high mortality rate (22%)
[15], which implied the importance of prompt recognition
and treatment of necrotizing fasciitis.
Endometritis
Postpartum endometritis results from a polymicrobial in￾fection of the decidua, characterized by fever ≥38.0 °C,
fundal tenderness, and purulent discharge from the uterus
[19]. Higher risks for endometritis are associated with CD
compared to vaginal delivery [5]. Postpartum endometritis
complicates 2-16% of women who underwent CD [8–12].
Risks are higher following CD performed in labor (3-11%)
compared with prelabor CDs (0.5-5%), as well as in pa￾tients who had ruptured membranes compared to intact
membranes (3-15% vs. 1-5%, respectively) [10, 20, 21]
Risk factors for surgical site infections following CD
Many different fisk factors for SSIs following CD have been
reported (Table 1). In decreasing order of significant risk as
measured by relative risks or odds ratios, risk factors include
subcutaneous hematoma [8], chorioamnionitis [22–24],
maternal comorbidities (American Society of Anesthesiolo￾gists class of 3 or greater) [22], tobacco use in pregnancy
[23], incision length > 16.6 cm [25], limited prenatal care
(fewer than 7 visits) [26], body mass index >30 or 35 kg/m2
[22, 24, 25, 27–29] corticosteroid use [25], subcutaneous
tissue thickness > 3 cm [30], prolonged second stage (com￾pared with first stage) [31], teaching service [8], no antibiotic
prophylaxis [26], pregestational diabetes [27, 29, 32], operat￾ing time ≥ 38 min [28], hypertensive disease/preeclampsia
[22, 29], duration of labor >12 h [24], nulliparity [22], twin
gestations [29], premature rupture of membranes [29],
gestational diabetes [33], blood loss (increased for every
increase in blood loss of 100 mL) [22], previous cesarean
delivery [33], emergency delivery [29], and rupture of mem￾branes (increased risk for every additional hour) [26].

$4000 for endometritis (in 2008 US dollars, correspond￾ing to $4200 and $4500 today, respectively) [34].
Prevention
Previous studies have shown that certain interventions
lower SSIs. Since CD is one of the most common proce￾dures performed worldwide, it is important for implemen￾tation of evidence-based approaches to decrease such
postoperative complications. A summary of studies de￾scribing such approaches is presented in Table 2.
Preoperative management
Preoperative antibiotics
Cefazolin
Administration of a first generation cephalosporin is the
mainstay of the prevention of SSIs after CD. A meta￾analysis of randomized controlled trials showed that the
use of first generation cephalosporin compared with no
antibiotics decreased the risks for development of
wound infections (Relative Risk [RR] 0.38; 95% confi￾dence interval [CI] 0.28, 0.53) and endometritis (RR
0.42; 95% CI 0.33, 0.54) [35]. Further, lower rates of SSIs
have been found with antibiotic administration of first
generation cephalosporin prior to skin incision com￾pared with administration after cord clamp [11, 36–39].
The meta-analysis by Constantine et al. reported the
risk of endometritis was lowered significantly (RR 0.47;
95% CI 0.26, 0.85) [11]. Another publication of a ran￾domized controlled trial showed lower rates of both
wound infection (OR] 0.7; 95% CI 0.55, 0.90) and endo￾metritis (OR 0.61; 95% CI 0.47, 0.79) when antibiotic
prophylaxis was given prior to skin incision compared
with after cord clamp [39].

The American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists (ACOG) recommend infusion of intravenous
1 g cefazolin within 60 min prior to skin incision [40]. For
women with (BMI >30 kg/m2 or weight > 100 kg, a dose of
2 g cefazolin intravenous infusion is recommended [40].
Though use of higher doses have been considered in
women with BMI > 40 kg/m2
, one retrospective study of
morbidly obese women did not demonstrate a difference in
SSIs comparing cefazolin doses of 2 g and 3 g [41].
Azithromycin
Recent reports have shown benefits to adding azithro￾mycin at the time of CD. A 2008 study by Tita et al. de￾scribed a lower risk of endometritis with the routine use
of intravenous azithromycin compared to standard anti￾biotic prophylaxis (0.9% vs. 12.5%; RR 0.11; 95% CI 0.06,
0.19; P < .001) [42]. In 2016, this same author reported
that adding intravenous azithromycin 500 mg to stand￾ard preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis was associated
with lower risks of endometritis (3.8% vs. 6.1%; RR 0.62;
95% CI 0.42, 0.92; P = .02) and wound infection (2.4%
vs. 6.6%; RR 0.35; 95% CI 0.22, 0.56; P < .001) in women
undergoing non-elective CD compared with placebo. [9]
The addition of preoperative azithromycin does not have
any short term effects on the neonates though long term
data are lacking. The randomized controlled study of
azithromycin in addition to standard antibiotics did not
demonstrate any differences in composite neonatal out￾come, death, and NICU admission [9].
Chlorhexidine alcohol skin preparation
Skin preparation (chlorhexidine alcohol vs. iodine) has
been examined by 2 randomized controlled trials with
disparate results. [43, 44] Tuuli et al. compared 572
women with chlorhexidine skin preparation with 575
women with iodine skin preparation in a randomized
controlled study and demonstrated a decreased rate of
wound infection (RR 0.55; 95%CI 0.34, 0.90; P = .02) in
patients with chlorhexidine skin preparation [43].
Results from another randomized controlled trial com￾paring povidone iodine alone (n = 463), chlorhexidine
alone (n = 474), and both (n = 467) showed similar
wound infection rates, however [44]. The reason for of
the different results of these two randomized controlled
trials is unclear. Nonetheless, a shift has begun towards
chlorhexidine alcohol and away from povidone iodine
skin preparation [18].
Use of clippers instead of razor
A 2011 Cochrane Data Base meta-analysis by Tanner et al.
comparing hair removal by shaving with clipping showed
a higher risk of wound infection associated with shaving
(RR 2.09; 95%CI 1.15, 3.80) [45]. Use of clippers instead of
razor for preoperative hair removal has been adopted by
many hospitals.
Preoperative vaginal cleansing
There has been a growing interest in assessing potential
benefits from preoperative vaginal cleansing. In the ran￾domized controlled trial of 218 women comparing chlor￾hexidine vaginal cleansing with no vaginal cleansing by
Ahmed et al., chlorhexidine vaginal cleansing compared
with no vaginal cleansing was associated with a lower rate
of endometritis (RR 0.2; 95% CI 0.06, 0.7) although the
rate of wound infection was similar (RR 0.6; 95% CI 0.2,
1.8) [46]. Vaginal cleansing by povidone iodine also has
been studied [10, 20, 47, 48]. Similar results were reported
using povidone-iodine in the Cochrane Data Base meta￾analysis by Haas in which vaginal preparation by
povidone-iodine compared with no preparation demon￾strated a lower risk of endometritis (RR 0.39; 95% CI
0.16, 0.97) with similar risks of wound infection (RR
0.99; 95% CI 0.57, 1.70) [48]. The risk reduction was
particularly strong in women with ruptured mem￾branes who had vaginal preparation by povidone￾iodine compared with no preparation (RR 0.13; 95%
CI 0.02, 0.66) [48].
Currently, only povidone-iodine is approved for use in
the vagina, though off-label use of chlorhexidine solutions
can be considered, especially in women with allergies to
iodine [49]. The use of preoperative vaginal cleansing
should be considered, especially in women with ruptured
membranes.
Intraoperative management
Many surgical maneuvers have been taught over time
without the benefit of evidence-based medicine. Below
are a number of such intraoperative steps that have been
evaluated recently for their merit.
Uterine exteriorization
Exteriorization of the uterus at the time of CD is often
performed for better visualization to repair the uterine in￾cision. A meta-analysis comparing repair in situ and by
uterine exteriorization did not demonstrate any statisti￾cally significant differences in surgical time, intraoperative
nausea or vomiting, endometritis, or wound infection
[50]. The decision on whether or not to exteriorize the
uterus should depend on provider preference.
Removal of placenta by traction of umbilical cord
Manual removal of the placenta compared with removal
via umbilical cord traction has been associated with
endometritis [51, 52]. In one meta-analysis, manual re￾moval of the placenta was associated with a higher risk
of endometritis compared with traction of umbilical
cord (RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.42, 1.90) [51].
Kawakita and Landy Maternal Health, Neonatology, and Perinatology (2017) 3:12 Page 4 of 9

Intraabdominal irrigation
Two studies have not demonstrated a reduction of SSIs
with intraabdominal irrigation of normal saline [53, 54].
In a randomized controlled trial of 236 women undergo￾ing CD, intraabdominal irrigation did not demonstrate
decreased risks of wound infection and endometritis,
but was associated with intraoperative nausea (RR 1.62;
95% CI 1.15, 2.28) [53]. Similarly in a randomized con￾trolled trial of 196 women undergoing CD, intraabdom￾inal irrigation by normal saline did not reduce
intrapartum or postpartum maternal morbidity [54].
Evidence does not support use of routine intraabdominal
irrigation.
Suture closure of subcutaneous tissue if wound thickness
greater than 2 cm
In a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,
Chelmow et al. evaluated the potential benefit of suture
closure of subcutaneous tissue relative to tissue thick￾ness [55]. Their study showed a statistically significant
decrease in the rate of wound complications when the
subcutaneous thickness was greater than 2 cm (RR 0.66;
95% CI 0.48, 0.91). [55]. This group also found that su￾ture closure of subcutaneous tissue was associated with
a lower risk of seroma (RR 0.42; 95% CI 0.24,1.49) but
not lower risks of wound hematomas (RR 1.03; 95% CI
0.38, 2.76) or wound infections (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.65,
1.49) [55]. Current practice has adopted use of subcuta￾neous closure when the subcutaneous thickness mea￾sures greater than 2 cm.
Subcutaneous drain
Ramsey et al. reported a randomized controlled trial of
280 women with subcutaneous thickness 4 cm or more
showing that routine subcutaneous drain was not associ￾ated with wound complications compared with standard
suture reaproximation [56]. This finding was confirmed
by a meta-analysis [57]. Routine subcutaneous drain is
not recommended.
Suture skin closure instead of staple closure
Studies comparing suture and staple closure of the skin
after CD are consistent in advising use of sutures over sta￾ples. In 2011, Tuuli et al. reported a meta-analysis of 6
studies and showed that an increased risk of wound infec￾tion or wound separation with staples (n = 803) compared
with suture skin closure (n = 684) (OR 2.06; 95% CI 1.43,
2.98) [58]. A 2012 Cochrane Review of 18 trials by
Mackeen et al. showed no increased risk of wound infec￾tion with staple skin closure [59]. Subsequently in 2014, a
randomized controlled study of 746 women by the same
group showed a lower risk of wound complications
(wound infection, hematoma, seroma, or separation of
1 cm or longer) with suture skin closure compared with
staple skin closure (adjusted OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.23, 0.78)
[6]. In this last study, the lower rate of wound complica￾tions was largely due to a decreased incidence of wound
separation (adjusted OR 0.20; 95% CI 0.07, 0.51). Based on
this evidence, routine staple skin closure is not recom￾mended. Further studies are needed to answer if decreased
risk of wound complications in suture skin closure com￾pared with staple closure is reproducible in vertical skin
incision.
Prophylactic negative pressure wound therapy
Negative pressure wound therapy (vacuum-assisted
wound closure) after CD is gaining popularity, espe￾cially in obese women. Negative pressure reduces
excess fluid accumulation and protects the wound
from irritation caused by reducing the frequency of
dressing changes to only every 3–5 days.
Data on prophylactic negative pressure wound therapy
after CD are limited. A systematic review of 7 randomized
trials using negative pressure wound therapy in patients
with chronic open wound compared with hydrocolloid gel
plus gauze or gauze soaked in normal saline or Ringer’s so￾lution did not shown improvement in wound healing [60].
Retrospective studies of prophylactic negative pressure
wound therapy after CD in morbidly obese women, how￾ever, demonstrated fewer wound complications [61, 62]. A
cost-benefit analysis showed that negative pressure wound
therapy is only beneficial if the risk of surgical site infection
is greater than 14% [63]. A large randomized controlled tri￾als comparing prophylactic negative pressure wound ther￾apy with standard dressing in women with obesity would
be useful.
Postoperative management
Dressing removal between 24 and 48 h
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend
dressing removal between 24 and 48 h [64]. In a group of
women who underwent scheduled CD, Peleg et al. in 2016
conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing post￾operative dressing removal at 6 h (n = 160) with dressing
removal at 24 h (n = 160) and showed no difference in
wound complications [7]. However, the women with earlier
dressing removal were more pleased or satisfied than those
with later dressing removal (OR 2.35; 95% CI 1.46, 3.79). It
is unknown if timing of dressing removal would make a dif￾ference in women having emergent CD or those with co￾morbidities such as obesity, diabetes, or hypertension.
Daily use of chlorhexidine gluconate soap after removal
of dressing
Information on daily use of chlorhexidine gluconate
soap after dressing removal in women after CD is lim￾ited. In a randomized nonblinded crossover trial of 7727
patients admitted in intensive care and bone marrow
Kawakita and Landy Maternal Health, Neonatology, and Perinatology (2017) 3:12 Page 5 of 9

transplantation units, daily bathing with chlorhexidine￾impregnated washcloths had a lower risk of acquisition
of multidrug-resistant organisms (5.10 cases per 1000
patient days vs. 6.60 cases per 1000 patient-days;
P = .03) and hospital acquired bloodstream infections
(4.78 cases per 1000 patient days vs. 6.60 cases per 1000
patient-days; P = .007) [65]. Similar studies involving
post-CD patients warrants further study.
Surgical bundle
Perioperative bundles of evidence-based practices to re￾duce SSIs have been introduced into non-obstetric surgi￾cal patients with promising results [66–68]. Similar results
can be anticipated in the obstetric population. We recom￾mend the development of SSI bundles for each hospital.
Our own institution, MedStar Washington Hospital Center,
began implementing a SSI bundle in December 2016 (Table
3). The study comparing the rate of SSIs prior to and after
bundle implementation is underway.
Treatment
Management of wound hematoma and seroma
Small hematomas may resorb without surgical interven￾tions, although they increase the incidence of SSI.
Management of wound hematoma includes evacuation
of the clot under sterile conditions, ligation or
cauterization of bleeding vessels, and reclosure of the
wound [69].
Seromas delay wound healing and increase the risk of
SSI. Seromas under skin can be evacuated by needle as￾piration. To prevent reaccumulation, compression dress￾ings should be applied. If seromas persist, wound
exploration in the operating room may be required [69].
Management of wound infection
Management of wound infection includes antibiotics, inci￾sion and drainage, wound dressing, and delayed closure.
Antibiotics
Superficial infection such as cellulitis can be treated with
antibiotics alone and do not require incision and drain￾age. If purulent drainage or exudates accompany cellu￾litis, empiric therapy should include adequate coverage
for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
[70]. Options for oral antibiotics include clindamycin,
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline (doxy￾cycline or monocycline). If cellulitis is nonpurulent (no
purulent drainage or exudate and no abscess), empiric
therapy to cover beta-hemolytic streptococci and
methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) is
recommended [71]. Options for oral antibiotics for non￾purulent cellulitis include dicloxacillin, cefadroxil, cepha￾lexin, and clindamycin.
Incision and drainage
If the wound has purulent drainage, exudate or separ￾ation, incision and drainage to remove abscess, exudate,
and hematoma is needed. If necrotic tissue is identified,
sharp debridement using forceps and scalpel or scissors
is needed until healthy tissue can be identified [72].
Further wound exploration to confirm the integrity of
fascia is also important. Fascial dehiscence is a surgical
emergency and requires further wound exploration in
the Operative Room.
Wound dressings
Packing may be required if the wound has a deep defect.
Commonly, wet to dry dressing changes several times
daily are performed, placing moistened gauze into the
wound with covering by dry gauze [73]. When the gauze
is removed during the dressing change, necrotic tissue is
also removed. Once necrotic tissue is completely re￾moved and healthy granulation tissue starts to grow,
dressing changes can be done less frequently. Other
available dressing materials include foam, beads,
alignate, hydrocolloids, and gauze with chlorhexidine,
povidone iodine and mercury chloride antiseptic solu￾tion. A systematic review showed no difference in speed
of wound recovery using these various types of dressing
materials [74].
Delayed closure
Infected wounds should be left open to heal by secondary
intention. In review of 8 prospective studies, reclosure of
wound was associated with 81-100% successful healing
[75]. Failures occurred in 21 of 324 reclosed wound, 16 of
which were complicated by recurrent abscesses. Wound

healing was faster in reclosure group compared with sec￾ondary intention (16–18 days vs. 61–72 days).
Management of necrotizing fasciitis
Treatment of necrotizing fasciitis includes early and ag￾gressive surgical exploration and debridement of necrotic
tissue in addition to broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy
[76]. The goal of surgical management is debridement of
necrotic tissue until healthy, viable tissue is reached. In
most cases, re-exploration of wound 24–36 h after the
first debridement and daily thereafter is necessary until no
necrotic tissue is found.
Empiric treatment of necrotizing fasciitis should include
agents effective against aerobes, including methicillin￾resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and anaerobes.
Acceptable choices for antibiotics are vancomycin, linezo￾lid, or daptomycin combined with one of the following op￾tions 1) piperacillin-tazobactam, 2) carbapenem, 3)
ceftriaxone plus metronidazole, or 4) fluoroquinolon plus
metronidazole [76]. In the setting of group A streptococ￾cal or beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection, the anti￾biotic regimen should be narrowed down to the
combination of penicillin (4 million units every 4 h) and
clindamycin (600-900 mg every 8 h). Clindamycin sup￾presses streptococcal toxin and cytokine production. The
efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) to
neutralize extracellular streptococcal toxins is unclear. In
a randomized controlled trial in Europe, addition of IVIG
to surgical treatment and antibiotics therapy did not im￾prove survival in women with streptococcal toxic shock
syndrome [77]. In the setting of Clostridium infection,
penicillin plus clindamycin is recommended [78]. The effi￾cacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for clostridium infec￾tion is unclear due to the lack of data from randomized
controlled trials in humans.
Management of endometritis
Endometritis is generally treated by clindamycin (900 mg
intravenously every 8 h) plus gentamicin [79]. Gentamicin
(5 mg/kg [ideal body weight]) compared with gentamicin
(1.5 mg/kg [ideal body weight] every 8 h) is similarly effi￾cacious, more cost effective and less task time for nurses
[80–82]. Ampicillin may be added to the regimen for bet￾ter coverage of enterococcus. If fever persists despite anti￾biotics administration, imaging of abdomen and pelvis
should be considered to rule out infected hematoma and
pelvic abscess.
Conclusions
SSIs following CDs represent complex clinical situations
and are caused by many factors such as patient charac￾teristics and perioperative management. In addition, SSIs
comprise a burden to our health care system. Creating
bundles of evidence-based elements may decrease the
rates of post-CD SSIs, as has been demonstrated in non￾obstetric patients. We strongly recommend each hospital
to consider the evidence-based information presented in
creating its own surgical bundle to decrease the rates of
SSIs after CDs.
