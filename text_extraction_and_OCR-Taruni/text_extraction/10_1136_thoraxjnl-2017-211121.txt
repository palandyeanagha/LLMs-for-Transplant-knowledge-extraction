Abstract
Familial pulmonary fibrosis is associated with loss-of￾function mutations in telomerase reverse transcriptase 
(TERT) and short telomeres. Interstitial lung diseases have 
become the leading indication for lung transplantation 
in the USA, and recent data indicate that pathogenic 
mutations in telomerase may cause unfavourable 
outcomes following lung transplantation. Although 
a rare occurrence, solid organ transplant recipients 
who develop acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) 
have very poor survival. This case report describes the 
detection of a novel mutation in TERT in a patient who 
had lung transplantation for familial pulmonary fibrosis 
and died from complications of acute GVHD.
Case-based discussion
A woman who had familial pulmonary fibrosis 
(figure 1A) presented to our transplant programme 
for evaluation. Her symptoms began 5 years prior 
with a chronic non-productive cough and dyspnoea. 
Spirometry showed a mild restrictive ventilatory 
abnormality, and chest CT showed typical charac￾teristics of pulmonary fibrosis (figure 1B). Despite 
experimental treatment with a lysophosphatidic 
acid receptor blocker and pirfenidone, her symp￾toms, physiological abnormalities and radiological 
findings progressively worsened with a nadir FVC 
of 1.46L (50% of predicted), total lung capacity of 
2.09L (41%) and diffusing capacity of the lungs for 
carbon monoxide of 3.7mL/min/mm Hg (22%). 
Histopathological analysis of the explanted native 
lungs showed end-stage lung disease and extensive 
interstitial fibrosis and honeycombing (figure 1C).
Given this patient’s family history of interstitial 
lung disease, we recommended sequencing studies 
to assess mutations in 14 different telomere biolo￾gy-related genes. Using next-generation sequencing 
(NGS) we identified a novel, non-synonymous 
mutation in telomerase reverse transcriptase 
(TERT), c.3100C>T, p.R1034C, that resulted in 
an amino acid substitution at a weakly conserved 
site (figure 1D). The allelic frequency of this muta￾tion in the ExAC database was 0.000008384 (1 in 
120 000). The in silico pathogenicity prediction 
tools SIFT, PolyPhen2, Align GVGD and REVEL 
provided contradictory results suggesting the 
mutation may or may not have deleterious effects 
on TERT, and prior studies have not described 
this variant. Therefore, we classified the mutation 
as a variant of unknown significance. However, 
her granulocyte telomere length measured by 
flow-fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) was 
below the first percentile for her age (figure 1E). 
Given this discrepancy between NGS and flow￾FISH, we undertook further experimental studies 
to evaluate the functional impact of this mutation. 
We employed U2OS cells that lack endogenous 
telomerase and ectopically expressed the telo￾merase components telomerase RNA component
(TERC) and either wild-type or mutant TERT. 
Importantly, expression levels of both TERC and 
different forms of TERT were similar in all cell lines 
analysed (data not shown). Using telomere repeat 
amplification protocol assays to assess telomerase 
activity, we found that TERT 3100C>T (R1034C) 
caused a marked reduction in telomerase activity 
by more than 75% compared with wild-type 
TERT (figure 1F). Additionally, this variant had a 
more deleterious effect on telomerase activity than 
TERT 3148A>G (K1050E), another variant in the 
c-terminal domain previously linked to pulmonary 
fibrosis (figure 1D,F).1
 These results demonstrated 
that the TERT 3100C>T variant severely compro￾mised telomerase activity by approximately 75% in 
human cells, supporting the pathogenicity of this 
mutation.
In October 2016, the patient had a bilateral lung 
transplant from a male donor. The donor-recip￾ient pair had bidirectional mismatches at human 
leucocyte antigens (HLA)-A, B, C, DRB1 and 
DQB1. Serological crossmatch was negative. Both 
the recipient and the donor were cytomegalovirus 
(CMV) seropositive. The lung transplant recip￾ient received induction therapy with basiliximab 
on the day of transplantation and 4 days later.

consisted of tacrolimus, mycophenolate and prednisone. Her 
infection prophylaxis regimen included acyclovir (later changed 
to valganciclovir), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and nystatin. 
She had a relatively uncomplicated immediate postoperative 
course and was discharged 9 days after surgery. However, 3 weeks 
later she developed a diffuse non-pruritic mottled rash on her 
chest and face that progressed to involve her back, extremities, 
palmar surfaces and oral mucosa. Initially, the rash was attributed 
to a drug reaction, and because of leukopenia valganciclovir was 
discontinued and mycophenolate was reduced and then eventu￾ally discontinued. She did not improve with these changes and 
her clinical condition continued to worsen with the development 
of watery diarrhoea, nausea, cough, gingival bleeding, chills and 
fever. When hospitalised for further evaluation, she was also 
found to have pancytopenia with 0.9x109
/L white blood cells/
μL, 9.5g/dL haemoglobin and 52x109
/L platelets. She received 
empirical antimicrobial therapy including cefepime, vanco￾mycin, metronidazole, micafungin and acyclovir.
Despite these changes in her medications, the patient continued 
to have progressive multiorgan dysfunction. Therefore, the trans￾plant team considered acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) as 
a possible diagnosis and evaluated her dysfunctional organs. Skin 
biopsy showed interface dermatitis, with short tandem repeat 
(STR) identity testing revealing mixed chimerism with 12% of 
the DNA derived from the donor. FISH of the X and Y chromo￾somes (XY-FISH) showed 39.5% donor-derived cells in the skin 
(figure 1G). Bone marrow core biopsy revealed a markedly hypo￾cellular marrow, and bone marrow aspirate XY-FISH showed 
2% donor-derived cells (figure 1H). Peripheral blood STR iden￾tity testing of CD3-enriched T cells demonstrated 42% donor 
origin, whereas CD15-enriched granulocytes were 100% recip￾ient derived. Endoscopic biopsy of the terminal ileum showed 
extensive lymphocytic inflammation with ulcerations and gran￾ulation tissue, and XY-FISH showed 39% of cells derived from 
the donor (figure 1I). Gross findings on colonoscopy showed 
complete loss of villi, erythema and granular appearance of the 
terminal ileum and an erosion in the caecum (figure 1J). Thus, 
the patient developed acute GVHD that became symptomatic 
about 1month after lung transplant.
The patient also had low-grade CMV viraemia upon read￾mission with blood CMV DNA levels of 1350–1450 IU/mL and 
CMV-positive cells detected in terminal ileum and stomach biop￾sies, though biopsies from the duodenum, ascending colon and 
descending colon were CMV negative. She received ganciclovir 
and then foscarnet for the CMV infection, with low blood CMV 
DNA levels ranging from <870to 9920 IU/mL. She did not 
show evidence of hepatitis.
In the setting of early post-transplant GVHD, she continued 
tacrolimus, had mycophenolate reinitiated and had her steroid 
dose markedly increased. She also received thymoglobulin 
and intravenous immunoglobulin and initiated extracorporeal 
photopheresis. For her pancytopenia she received filgrastim, 
eltrombopag, and red blood cell and platelet transfusions. Bone 
marrow transplant evaluation was also initiated. However, she 
developed a bowel perforation and septic shock, and based on 
patient and family wishes, she received comfort care only and 
died a few days later.
Discussion
This case report describes the discovery of a novel loss-of-func￾tion mutation in the telomerase gene TERT 3100C>T in a patient 
with familial pulmonary fibrosis who developed acute GVHD 
involving the bone marrow, skin and gastrointestinal tract about 
1month after lung transplantation. Telomeres support genomic 
integrity, especially in rapidly dividing cells such as the respira￾tory epithelium and immune cells.2
 Recent evidence suggests that 
patients who have familial pulmonary fibrosis and a pathogenic 
telomerase mutation have unfavourable outcomes following 
lung transplantation that include thrombocytopenia, leucopenia 
and poor tolerance of immunosuppressive agents.3
Normally, a transplant recipient’s immune system recognises 
foreign cells in the solid organ allograft, mounts an immune 
response and eliminates donor-derived immune cells. Rarely, this 
immunosurveillance programme fails in solid-organ transplant 
recipients, leading to donor immune cell engraftment and the 
development of acute GVHD.4
 This rare complication results in 
death within 1–2 months of onset in most cases.5
 The factors that 
contribute to acute GVHD are not well understood, although 
this patient had bidirectional donor-recipient HLA class I and 
II mismatches which may support immune surveillance of the 
lung allograft. Abnormally low telomerase activity is associated 
with impaired immunosurveillance and defective cell-mediated 
immunity,6
 and this report suggests that loss-of-function muta￾tions in telomerase may reduce the ability to effectively eliminate 
donor immune cells in lung grafts.
We hypothesise that the loss-of-function mutation in the telo￾merase gene TERT 3100C>T and the associated impaired telo￾merase activity led to defective cell-mediated immunity and T 
cell exhaustion7
 and contributed to the patient's susceptibility for 
developing acute GVHD. Even though the donor lung allografts 
likely transferred a low number of T cells to the recipient, the 
recipient’s exhausted or depleted T cells may have left an immu￾nological niche filled by donor T cells undergoing homeostatic 
proliferation to replete the overall T cell pool.8
 In addition, the 
donor’s T cells may have had a competitive advantage over the 
recipient’s T cells with defective telomerase, and this may have 
supported engraftment and subsequent acute GVHD. Though 
the patient did not exhibit evidence of bone marrow failure 
prior to lung transplantation, her immune cells with defective 
telomerase may have been more susceptible to immunosup￾pressive medications than donor-derived cells. Once engrafted, 
donor T cells were likely stimulated with recipient-specific (eg, 
mismatched HLA) and/or pathogen-specific (eg, CMV) antigens 
to promote donor T cell proliferation and GVHD.
While recipient telomerase deficiency seems unlikely or is 
unknown to contribute to most reported cases of acute GVHD 
following lung transplantation,9
 the present study suggests that 
telomerase mutations could potentially contribute in some cases. 
Future studies should further assess the relationship between 
telomerase mutations and the risk of developing acute GVHD, 
bone marrow failure, and related complications after lung trans￾plantation, and how related changes in patient management will 
affect patient outcomes.
