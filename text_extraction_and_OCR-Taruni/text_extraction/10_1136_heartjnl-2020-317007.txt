Abstract
Objective We sought to explore the prevalence and 
immediate clinical implications of acute myocardial injury 
in a cohort of patients with COVID-19 in a region of 
China where medical resources are less stressed than in 
Wuhan (the epicentre of the pandemic).
Methods We prospectively assessed the medical 
records, laboratory results, chest CT images and use of 
medication in a cohort of patients presenting to two 
designated covid-19 treatment centres in Sichuan, China. 
Outcomes of interest included death, admission to an 
intensive care unit (ICU), need for mechanical ventilation, 
treatment with vasoactive agents and classification of 
disease severity. Acute myocardial injury was defined by 
a value of high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) greater 
than the normal upper limit.
Results A total of 101 cases were enrolled from 
January to 10 March 2020 (average age 49 years, IQR
34–62 years). Acute myocardial injury was present in 
15.8% of patients, nearly half of whom had a hs-TnT 
value fivefold greater than the normal upper limit. 
Patients with acute myocardial injury were older, with a 
higher prevalence of pre-existing cardiovascular disease 
and more likely to require ICU admission (62.5% vs 
24.7%, p=0.003), mechanical ventilation (43.5% vs 
4.7%, p<0.001) and treatment with vasoactive agents 
(31.2% vs 0%, p<0.001). Log hs-TnT was associated 
with disease severity (OR 6.63, 95% CI 2.24 to 19.65), 
and all of the three deaths occurred in patients with 
acute myocardial injury.
Conclusion Acute myocardial injury is common in 
patients with COVID-19 and is associated with adverse 
prognosis.
Introduction
The recent outbreak of COVID-19 is a public 
health emergency of international concern and 
continues to spread worldwide. Knowledge 
concerning this threatening disease is accumulating 
rapidly, but many uncertainties remain, including 
detailed understanding of its extrapulmonary 
manifestations.
ACE2 has been identified as a functional 
receptor for coronaviruses and is highly expressed 
in the lungs as well as the heart.1
 Electrocardio￾graphic changes, troponin elevation and subclin￾ical left ventricular diastolic impairment have been 
previously reported in patients with severe acute 
respiratory syndrome (SARS).2 3 Similarly, acute 
myocardial injury (defined by elevated levels of 
cardiac biomarkers, troponin or creatine kinase 
(CK)) appears to be frequent during the current 
outbreak of COVID-19,4
 although the mechanisms 
of injury and its clinical implications remain poorly 
defined. The majority of patients currently requiring 
hospital care for COVID-19 are categorised as non￾severe.5
 It is therefore important to understand 
whether accompanying acute myocardial injury is 
a bystander phenomenon or an important contrib￾utor to immediate and long-term outcome with 
implications for clinical management.
Although recent reports have demonstrated the 
association of cardiac injury with mortality, these 
data arose from Wuhan, where medical resources 
have been most stressed,6 7 potentially augmenting 
the effect of cardiac injury due to delayed hospital 
admission and specialist management. Analysis of 
data from less stressed regions is also needed to 
confirm the broader significance of cardiac injury in 
COVID-19. Accordingly, we sought to characterise 
the prevalence and clinical implications of acute 
myocardial injury in a large cohort of patients with 
laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in a region where 
clinical resources are under less pressure.
Methods
Study population
We collected the data of 103 consecutive patients 
with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection 
admitted to the Public Health Clinical Centre of 
Chengdu and West China Hospital, Sichuan Univer￾sity, between 16 January and 10 March 2020. Both 
institutions are certified COVID-19 tertiary care 
hospitals and designated hub centres within Sichuan 
province. Laboratory-confirmed cases were defined 
by a positive result on high-throughput sequencing 
or real-time reverse-transcriptase–PCR assay of 
nasal and/or pharyngeal swabs.8
Data collection
Medical records, use of medications and the find￾ings of laboratory investigations, chest CT and 
transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), where 
available, were collected from all patients. Admis￾sion laboratory investigations included full blood

troponin T (hs-TnT), creatine kinase and MB subfraction (CK￾MB), N-terminal-proB-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) 
and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)). TTE was performed if 
needed to guide clinical care, and all chest CT scans were evalu￾ated by investigators blinded to patients’ clinical status.
Study outcomes
Key outcomes included disease severity (see further), admission 
to an intensive care unit (ICU), need for mechanical ventilation 
or vasoactive agents, and death.
Patient and public involvement
Patients and the public were not involved in the study design, 
analysis, interpretation and writing of the study.
Study definitions
Severity of COVID-19 was classified at the time of admission 
using the novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnostic criteria and 
treatment regimens defined by the National Health Commis￾sion of the People’s Republic of China,9
 and reclassifed at the 
time of hospital discharge according to clinical evolution of the 
disease. These diagnostic criteria and treatment regimen have 
been recently updated to a seventh version, but criteria defining 
a severe/critical case remain unchanged from the fourth version 
(published before discharge of the first case in this cohort). Severe 
(r espiratory rate, ≥30 breaths/min; resting oxygen saturation, 
≤93%; or PaO2
/FiO2
 ratio, ie, oxygenation index,≤300mm 
Hg) and critical (respiratory failure requiring mechanical venti￾lation, shock or need for intensive care) cases were grouped 
together for the purposes of this study. Acute myocardial injury 
was defined by an hs-TnT value greater than the institutional 
upper limit of normal (14pg/mL). A single radiologist assessed 
the CT pulmonary lesion ratio (defined by the ratio of the sum 
of lesion areas on each slice to the total pulmonary tissue area) 
for all patients.
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables are expressed as medians (IQRs). Cate￾gorical variables are expressed as frequencies (percentages). 
Continuous variables were compared using the Student t-test or 
the Mann-Whitney U test, as appropriate, and categorical vari￾ables using χ2
 test or the Fisher exact test, as appropriate. Since 
values of NT-proBNP and hs-TnT were not normally distributed, 
data were log-transformed for multivariate analyses. Pearson’s 
correlation was used to test the association between ejection 
fraction and log hs-TnT. A multivariate linear regression anal￾ysis was carried out to explore independent factors associated 
with hs-TnT levels. Those with p<0.05 in univariate analysis 
were introduced into the multivariate linear regression model. 
To investigate the impact of factors on disease severity, logistic 
regression analyses were carried out to determine ORs and 95% 
CIs for covariates with severe/critical disease as the bivariate 
outcome. Considering the number of events, we did not further 
perform multivariate logistic regression. We considered age and 
gender, daily habit, comorbidities, use of medications, lab tests 
and pulmonary issues for candidate variables in both regression 
models, which were age and gender, smoking, use of ACE inhib￾itor (ACEi), angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) or calcium 
channel blocker (CCB), estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(eGFR), CRP, white blood cell count (WBC), log NT-proBNP, 
log hs-TnT, pulmonary lesion ratio, oxygenation index and 
pre-existing coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes 
mellitus or cerebrovascular disease. All statistical analyses were 
performed using STATA/MP V.16.0, and a two-sided p value of 
<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Two patients were excluded from analysis due to missing data. 
Among 101 patients (average age 49 years, IQR 34–62 years) 
with complete datasets, 16 (15.8%) had evidence of acute 
myocardial injury (hs-TnT>14 pg/mL) (figure 1). Baseline 
characteristics of patients with and without acute myocardial 
injury are displayed in table 1. Patients with cardiac injury 
were older, with a higher prevalence of pre-existing cardio￾vascular disease (hypertension, coronary artery disease and 
cerebrovascular disease), presented with more significant 
dyspnoea and were more frequently treated with ACEi, ARB 
and CCB. They also had lower eGFR and oxygenation index, 
higher CRP, PCT, NT-proBNP and other cardiac biomarkers
(CK, CK-MB and LDH), and a greater pulmonary lesion ratio.
Univariate linear regression analyses using hs-TnT as a
continuous variable demonstrated that age, use of ACEi 
or ARB, CRP, log NT-proBNP and pulmonary lesion ratio
correlated positively with log hs-TnT (and inverse correlation
with eGFR and oxygenation index) (table 2). In multivariate 
analysis, log hs-TnT was independently associated with the 
use of ACEi/ARB (β=1.11, p=0.02) and eGFR (β=−0.017, 
p=0.006). Among patients with TTE data (n=32), there was a 
negative correlation between ejection fraction and log TnT-hs
(r=−0.64, p<0.001; figure 2).
Clinical outcomes are summarised in table 3. Patients with 
acute myocardial injury were more frequently classified as 
severe/critical (75.0% vs 29.4%, p=0.001) and were more 
likely to require admission to ICU (62.5% vs 24.7%, p=0.003), 
mechanical ventilation (43.5% vs 4.7%, p<0.001) and vaso￾active agents (31.2% vs 0%, p<0.001). Furthermore, all of 
the three deaths occurred in patients with acute myocardial 
injury. Older age, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, the 
use of CCB, lower eGFR, and elevated NT-proBNP, hs-TnT

Discussion
Our study provides structured information concerning the role 
of acute myocardial injury in the setting of COVID-19 in regions 
affected by the pandemic but where resources are less stressed. We 
demonstrate that elderly patients with pre-existing cardiovascular 
disease and using antihypertensive drugs (including ACEi and ARB) 
are more likely to present with acute myocardial injury, although 
with a lower incidence than those in Wuhan, the epicentre of 
the pandemic (15.8% vs 19.7%–27.8%), which in turn leads to 
more severe disease manifestations, including increased need for

death.
Within the past two decades, coronaviruses and influenza viruses 
have hit the world several times, causing significant mortality, 
economic loss and global panic. The true health burden may be 
underestimated since extrapulmonary manifestations are frequent. 
Acute cardiovascular complications of pneumonia are common 
and result from various mechanisms, including relative ischaemia, 
systemic inflammation and pathogen-mediated damage.10 Troponin 
is a widely accepted biomarker of myocardial injury, and elevated 
serum levels have been a notable feature during recent epidemics of 
respiratory virus infections.11–13 Similarly, acute myocardial injury 
has been demonstrated in 7.2%–12% of patients with COVID-19 
in preliminary reports,8 14 with a higher prevalence among those 
requiring intensive care. Troponin elevation was transient in some 
studies13 and associated with reversible subclinical left ventricular 
diastolic impairment in SARS,3
 suggesting that it may be an inno￾cent bystander phenomenon. However, patients with COVID-19 
frequently present with initial cardiovascular symptoms, such as 
palpitations and chest tightness,4
 and fulminant myocarditis has 
been reported as a cause of death,15 suggesting a complex interac￾tion between this respiratory virus and the cardiovascular system. 
A study clearly delineating the clinical implications of troponin 
elevation in COVID-19 is therefore of considerable value.
COVID-19 is principally a lung pathogen and the pulmonary 
functional status is the principal determinant of classification of 
disease severity, clinical course and prognosis.16 Although the 
proportion of severe cases was around 15% in a recent nation￾wide study,1
 major adverse outcomes (including ICU admission 
and death) were also frequent in non-severe cases. Given that the
majority of cases are non-severe, clear management strategies for
this subgroup of patients are of vital importance, particularly as 
COVID-19 spreads worldwide. Our analysis demonstrates that 
acute myocardial injury complicating COVID-19 infection (indi￾cated by troponin elevation) is associated with a considerable 
disease burden, including classification as a severe/critical case, 
increased need for mechanical ventilation and use of vasoactive 
agents, and a higher risk of death.
Cardiac injury in itself may reflect an ongoing patholog￾ical insult due to cytokine release or secondary hypoxaemia.4
Conversely, a florid systemic inflammatory response or immune 
paresis in patients with cardiac injury is likely to be associated with 
more severe pulmonary manifestations. This hypothesis is partly 
supported by our observation that patients with acute myocardial 
injury also demonstrated higher levels of CRP and PCT and a 
greater pulmonary lesion ratio.
Patients with acute myocardial injury were generally the elderly, 
with a higher likelihood of pre-existent cardiovascular comorbid￾ities and use of antihypertensive drugs, such as ACEi and ARB. 
Age and comorbidities are consistently identified as risk factors for 
adverse events in outbreaks of respiratory virus infection. Indeed, 
the severity of the primary respiratory syndrome and risk of adverse 
outcomes in Middle East respiratory syndrome was increased in 
patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease.17 Mortality data 
from 44672 cases of COVID-19 released by the Chinese Centre 
for Disease Control and Prevention demonstrate that patients with 
cardiovascular comorbidities have a much higher mortality (10.5% 
vs 0.9%).18 The background clinical profile of patients with 
acute myocardial injury may also facilitate direct virus-mediated

Key messages
What is already known on this subject?
► The involvement of the cardiovascular system in patients with 
fatal coronavirus infections have been reported during the 
outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle 
East respiratory syndrome. During COVID-19, the incidence of 
acute cardiac injury, as indicated by the elevation of troponin, 
ranged from 7.2% to 27.8%. In cohorts from Wuhan (the 
epicentre of the pandemic), the association of cardiac injury 
with mortality has been reported.
What might this study add?
► This study was conducted in regions where medical resources 
were less stressed than Wuhan. In a cohort of 101 laboratory￾confirmed COVID-19 cases, acute myocardial injury (high￾sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT)>14 pg/mL) was present in 
15.8% of patients. Patients with acute myocardial injury were 
older, with a higher prevalence of pre-existing cardiovascular 
disease, and were more likely to require intensive care unit 
(ICU) admission (62.5% vs 24.7%, p=0.003), mechanical 
ventilation (43.5% vs 4.7%, p<0.001) and treatment with 
vasoactive agents (31.2% vs 0%, p<0.001). Log hs-TnT was 
associated with disease severity (OR 6.63, 95% CI 2.24 to 
19.65), and all of the three deaths in our cohort occurred in 
patients with acute myocardial injury.
How might this impact on clinical practice?
► Acute myocardial injury is common in patients with 
COVID-19, particularly in the elderly with pre-existing 
cardiovascular comorbidities, and is associated with increased 
risk of progressive severe disease, need for ICU admission, 
mechanical ventilation and use of vasoactive agents, and 
death. This subgroup of cases may need targeted treatment 
and preventative strategies.
cardiovascular disease is also likely to explain the more frequent 
use of ACEi/ARB in the group of patients with acute myocardial 
injury. ACE2 is the functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and 
increased levels associated with the use of renin–angiotensin–aldo￾sterone system inhibitors19 might increase the possibility of virus￾mediated myocardial damage. However, this explanation remains 
hypothetical, and there are no current reliable data to justify alter￾ation of ACEi/ARB treatment in patients with COVID-19.
Hubei Province (Wuhan) has an over 100-fold greater number 
of COVID-19 cases than Sichuan Province. The surge of cases 
needing medical care, especially in the early period of this 
outbreak, posed a major challenge to the regional healthcare 
system. Our results further support the association of cardiac 
injury with adverse events in patients with covid-19.6 7 20 Further￾more, the disparity in the number of cases between the adjacent 
regions of Hubei and Sichuan Provinces clearly demonstrates the 
public health advantages of ‘lockdown’ in the national and inter￾national management of the COVID-19 outbreak.
Our study has inevitable limitations at this early stage of the 
COVID-19 outbreak. With a small sample size, we are unable 
to draw definitive conclusions and acknowledge the existence 
of selection bias during this very early study period in specialist 
hub centres. Owing to circumstances, complete documentation of 
exposure history and laboratory testing was not available for every 
patient, and echocardiography was only performed for clinical 
expediency. As a consequence, we were only able to define acute 
myocardial injury by troponin elevation without detailing myocar￾dial tissue characteristics and haemodynamic function. Caution 
should be taken when interpreting the multivariable analysis of 
hs-TnT since the model is likely underpowered to assess indepen￾dent associations for other predictors in the model.
Conclusions
Acute myocardial injury, as indicated by troponin elevation, is 
common in patients with COVID-19, particularly in the elderly 
with pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities, and is associated 
with increased risk of progressive severe disease, need for ICU 
admission, mechanical ventilation and use of vasoactive agents, 
and death. Targeted treatment and preventative strategies are 
urgently needed for this vulnerable patient group.
