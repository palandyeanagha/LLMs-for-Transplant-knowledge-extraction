Abstract
Introduction: Pediatric z scores are necessary to describe size and structure of the heart in growing children, however,
development of an accurate z score calculator requires robust normal datasets, which are difficult to obtain with
cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in children. Motion-corrected (MOCO) cines from re-binned, reconstructed real￾time cine offer a free-breathing, rapid acquisition resulting in cines with high spatial and temporal resolution. In
combination with child-friendly positioning and entertainment, MOCO cine technique allows for rapid cine volumetry in
patients of all ages without sedation. Thus, our aim was to prospectively enroll normal infants and children birth-12 years
for creation and validation of a z score calculator describing normal right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) size.
Methods: With IRB approval and consent/assent, 149 normal children successfully underwent a brief noncontrast CMR on
a 1.5 T scanner including MOCO cines in the short axis, and RV and LV volumes were measured. 20% of scans were re￾measured for interobserver variability analyses. A general linear modeling (GLM) framework was employed to identify and
properly represent the relationship between CMR-based assessments and anthropometric data. Scatter plots of model fit
and Akaike’s information criteria (AIC) results were used to guide the choice among alternative models.
Results: A total of 149 subjects aged 22 days–12 years (average 5.1 ± 3.6 years), with body surface area (BSA) range 0.21–
1.63 m2 (average 0.8 ± 0.35 m2
) were scanned. All ICC values were > 95%, reflecting excellent agreement between raters.
The model that provided the best fit of volume measure to the data included BSA with higher order effects and gender
as independent variables. Compared with earlier z score models, there is important additional growth inflection in early
toddlerhood with similar z score prediction in later childhood.
Conclusions: Free-breathing, MOCO cines allow for accurate, reliable RV and LV volumetry in a wide range of infants and
children while awake. Equations predicting fit between LV and RV normal values and BSA are reported herein for
purposes of creating z scores.

Introduction
Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is
considered the gold standard imaging method for cardiac
chamber quantification, thoracic vasculature assessment
and noninvasive hemodynamic assessment in children [1].
However, in growing children, a single measurement of a
cardiac structure without context is minimally inform￾ative, and thus measurements are ideally interpreted in
light of that child’s anthropometric data with z scores.
This contextual requirement for interpreting measure￾ments is fairly unique to pediatric medicine, and is com￾pounded by the depth and breadth of congenital heart
disease that can drastically alter cardiovascular structure
and size in growing children. In this way, physicians can
more clearly understand if observed measurements are
within 2SD of the mean, and more importantly, if change
in a measurement is expected or unexpected for growth.
There are also publications in the adult cardiovascular lit￾erature touting the importance of interpreting measure￾ments of cardiovascular structures as a percentile of mean
normative values for size and age [2].
Pediatric z scores are regularly used to understand and
describe normal size and structure of the heart from
transthoracic echocardiography [3, 4], which enables not
only the delineation of normal and abnormal, but de￾scribes the standardized magnitude of difference between
an observed abnormal value and the predicted normal
value. Early publications of pediatric cardiac z scores in￾cluded linear measurements from 2D echo of various car￾diac structures where body surface area (BSA) was the
independent variable to which the measurements were re￾lated and based on [5, 6]. Others have published smaller
series of niche measurements of pediatric cardiac struc￾tures, including Doppler assessments of valves, left ven￾tricular (LV) mass [7] and coronary artery dimension [8,
9], as well as z scores for cardiac structures in the develop￾ing fetus [10]. Most recently, and most comprehensively,
Lopez et al. published the most robust set of 2D echocar￾diography measurements that describe normal growth in
children over a wide range of BSA, ages and ethnicities
[11]. Z scores gauging the relative size of a cardiac struc￾ture in children are valuable to the cardiac imaging com￾munity, as well as the larger pediatric cardiology and
cardiothoracic surgery community to provide standards
for decision-making regarding interventions and for the
evaluation of outcomes.
Prior publications exist which have sought to provide
calculators for z scores of right ventricular (RV) and LV
volumes in a population of children imaged with CMR.
This is an inherently difficult undertaking as CMR is not
typically utilized as a screening imaging modality in the
way that echo is, and thus there are far fewer normal
exams available. The pretest probability of presence of any
cardiovascular disease is significant just by being referred
for a CMR. Nevertheless, investigators have published z
score calculators for various cardiovascular structures
measured by CMR, notably for the thoracic aorta and pul￾monary arteries [12, 13]. Some teams have been able to
prospectively enroll healthy adult subjects to create a data￾base of normal CMR measurements for adults based on
age [14]. Current CMR volumetry z scores for children
offer a reasonable fit based on gender and BSA [15–17],
and most recently van der Ven et al. [18] published pooled
analyses of pediatric volumes in 141 children based on
age, but the results are difficult to apply generally due to
inclusion of subjects with a wide range of age and size, as
well as possible introduction of bias due to differences in
anesthetic state and loading conditions in some of the
subjects. Furthermore, due to paucity of normal CMR
data, these z score calculators are based on data from a
small number of included subjects. Sparsity of data at
younger ages and smaller sizes has led to increased vari￾ability and uncertainty of estimates.
In 2016 and 2018, our group published a novel work￾flow for rapid, free-breathing acquisition for quantification
of LV and RV volumes and systolic function, respectively,
based on real-time cine with short acquisition times that
were re-binned and reconstructed with high spatial and
temporal resolution with motion correction (MOCO) [19,
20]. This MOCO cine approach [21] is entirely free￾breathing, has optimized signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), is re￾constructed inline using distributed computing in the
same amount of time or less than that needed to acquire
and reconstruct a typical breath-held, segmented balanced
steady state free precession (bSSFP) cine stack in an awake
and compliant patient [22]. Other groups have published
similar successful techniques specific for rapid, free￾breathing cine acquisition in children combining spiral
bSSFP and compressed sensing [23]. MOCO cines, in
combination with child-friendly positioning and patient
entertainment systems, allows for rapid cine volumetry in
patients of all ages without the use of sedation. This novel
workflow provides the basis for accurate, rapid acquisition
of ventricular volumes and function, and essentially
allowed this current study evaluating normal ventricular
sizes in children to be performed.
Our goal was to prospectively enroll normal infants and
children birth-12 years for awake, free-breathing measure￾ment of their RV and LV volumes using validated, rapid
acquisition techniques for creation of a validated z score
calculator describing normal RV and LV size.
Methods
Subject recruitment
With IRB approval and informed consent/assent where ap￾propriate, 213 healthy children, and 5 infants with known
normal intracardiac anatomy who presented for a non￾sedate “feed and bundle” CMR to evaluate for a vascular
Olivieri et al. Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (2020) 22:11 Page 2 of 12

ring, were prospectively enrolled in this study. Healthy sub￾jects were recruited with flyers located at outpatient sub￾specialty centers located throughout the metropolitan
Washington, D.C. region and via the Children’s National
social media accounts. Prior to imaging, parents answered a
brief questionnaire over the phone regarding the child’s
past medical history and family history, so that children
with significant systemic disease, genetic conditions or first
degree relatives with significant heart disease in the young
were excluded. Eligible families were sent a link to a pre￾paratory movie explaining what to wear and bring to the
appointment, and how to navigate the hospital quickly and
efficiently, as they typically visited the hospital on evenings
and weekends to increase efficiency in intake procedures
and scanning. On arrival, height and weight were measured,
safety screening was completed, and medical information,
including a normal physical examination and absence of
pediatrician concerns and emergency department visits
since scheduling was again verified to ensure inclusion and
exclusion criteria were met. At the conclusion of the exam,
pediatricians were sent a brief clinical report, and any ab￾normalities were followed up with a pediatric cardiologist.
Children received a gift card and small toy, and parents
were reimbursed for parking/public transportation.
CMR imaging
CMR imaging was performed on a 1.5 T scanner (Aera,
Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen Germany) with no sed￾ation between summer 2017 – winter 2018 (18 months).
Infants less than 9 months, including the 5 infants with a
clinically indicated scan to evaluate for a vascular ring,
were positioned and scanned using the feed and bundle
technique with an infant immobilizer after feeding/burp￾ing (Fig. 1a). Children older than 9 months were offered
headphones and patient entertainment system with
movies for distraction. Younger children were positioned
inside the magnet with their parent’s arms holding them
for comfort (Fig. 1b), similar to previously published work
with non-sedated imaging in young children. Older
children were positioned in a typical fashion, and parents
were offered a seat near the edge of the bore, if needed.
Once the children were settled, a standard clinical
imaging protocol at our institution commenced using
completely free-breathing techniques, as previously pub￾lished by our group [19, 20], with parameters tailored to
age and size. A stack of MOCO, re-binned cines was
performed in the short axis projection with at least 8
slices through the ventricle in diastole to create full
volumetric coverage of the ventricles. Sequence parame￾ters were selected based on subject weight, and temporal
resolution varied slightly based on subject heart rate. For
example, if the heart rate is 60 bpm, the reconstructed
temporal resolution will be 30 ms. For subjects in our
cohort with higher heart rates, the reconstructed tem￾poral resolution will be less than 30 ms to capture fast
heart motion. (see Table 1). Phase contrast data was
used to confirm the absence of significant intracardiac
shunt that would alter cardiac chamber size from what
was expected and prompt exclusion of that subject. To
that end, flow in the ascending aorta and main pulmon￾ary artery were performed with standard sequences
(repetition time 9 ms; echo time 5 ms; matrix, 128 to
192 × 256, field of view, 250 to 350 mm; flip angle, 15;
slice thickness, 5 to 7 mm; free breathing acquisition,
number signal averages of 3; retrospective gating, 20 to
40 phases; in-plane and through-plane resolution opti￾mized to patient size). Studies were assessed for quality
as they were acquired, and if motion artifacts were
present, sequences were repeated up to two times before
the study was terminated. Studies were also checked at
the time of imaging to screen for any data that would
suggest a significant previously unrecognized cardiovas￾cular abnormality, including Qp:Qs > 1.25, RV ejection
fraction (RVEF) < 45%, LV ejection fraction (LVEF) <
55%. All studies took less than 20 min, and most studies
took less than 10 min of scan time. See Additional files
1, 2 and 3 for examples of contoured cines for Infant,
Little Kid and Big Kid cines from Table 1.

Image analysis
Three pediatric cardiologists with training in CMR (YL
with 3 years of experience, LO with 11 years of experience
and RC with 15 years of experience) supervised the studies
and performed the analyses using standard offline analysis
tools (MedisSuite, Medis, Leiden, the Netherlands)
according to standard imaging analysis guidelines, with in￾clusion of papillary muscle and right ventricular trabecula￾tions in the blood pool (Fig. 2, Additional files 1, 2 and 3)
[15, 24]. Standard measurements of volumetry and flow
were obtained for each study. A subset of 20% of studies
were made available for a second, blinded reader from this
group to perform analyses of RV and LV volumes for
inter-rater reliability analyses of all 3 readers.
Statistical methods
Analyses were implemented in STATA (Stata Statistical
Software: Release 15. Stata Corporation, College Station,
Texas, USA). A general linear modeling (GLM) framework
was employed to identify and properly represent the
relationship between CMR-based assessments and an￾thropometric data. Scatter plots for model fit and Akaike’s
information criteria (AIC) results were used to guide the
choice among alternative models. At each stage of model
selection, model fit and normality of model residuals was
evaluated to ensure that underlying assumptions were not
violated. Before model development, 2-way random effects,
target and rater, models were developed to estimate the
intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) reflecting the average
level of agreement between paired CMR-based volumetric
determinations made by each cardiologist.

sedate limited CMR to evaluate for a possible vascular
ring were screened for inclusion. One subject was ex￾cluded due to ongoing workup for a possible genetic ab￾normality. Appointments for 217 children were made
for the study, and 192 subjects kept their appointment.
Of these 192, 153 children (81%) were successfully
scanned without sedation. Two children were excluded
from the final analysis due to the presence of previously
unknown cardiovascular findings found at the time of
the CMR (bicuspid aortic valve in a 6 year old boy with￾out significant family history, and mild supravalar aortic
stenosis in a 2 year old girl). Thirty-nine children were
unable to complete the full scan due to age-appropriate
anxiety/behavior. Two additional children had BSA’s
that exceeded 2SD of the normal range, and so their
data were also excluded. A final total of 149 children
were included in the study.
Demographics of this successfully imaged normal co￾hort of 149 children are shown in Table 2. Subjects
ranged in age 22 days − 12 years (average 5.1 ± 3.6 years),
with BSA range0.21–1.63 m2 (average 0.8 ± 0.35 m2
), and
heart rate range 51–197 bpm, average 100 ± 25 bpm.
Interobserver analysis
ICC estimates reflecting the average level of agreement be￾tween all possible pairs of three cardiologists’ CMR-based
volumetric determinations were obtained, and all ICC
values were above 95%, reflecting excellent agreement
across each of the pairs of raters on each volumetric deter￾mination. Detailed results for the ICC analyses are found in
Table 3, and depicted by Bland-Altman analysis in Fig. 4.

of the CMR-based volumetric parameters focused on
BSA as the key metric:
Outcome ¼ β0 þ β1BSA þ β2BSA^2 þ β3sex
We evaluated the alternative transformations, includ￾ing identity log, square root and each created accept￾ably normalized vol. However, the model that
provided the best fit to the data included untrans￾formed volume measurements. This model provided
an excellent fit to the normative data with normally
distributed residuals and it explained more than 90%
of the variance of all volumetric outcomes except LV
cardiac output and RV cardiac output, for which it
explained more than 78–79%% of the variance. Before
choosing this model, models with more parameters,
including heart rate during CMR, weight and height
instead of BSA, age, as well as additional higher order
effects were evaluated. Models including age in
addition to BSA were considered but were abandoned
due to concern for over-fitting and variance inflation
because of the high correlation between BSA and age
(r > 0.9). None of the alternative models excluding
age offered a better fit by visual inspection and con￾firmed by AIC. In spite of the lack of a statistically
significant relationship between RV ejection fraction
(RVEF) and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) and BSA in
this dataset, all model parameters needed for the z
score determinations are included in Table 4, and
plots depicting final model fits are found in Figs. 5
and 6 (left heart and right heart, respectively), with
Z = + 2, 0, − 2 lines.
A z-score calculator is provided to reflect the
deviation of patient’s measured volume from the
norm estimated from the model using the following
computation:
Z−score vol ð Þ¼ Patient Vol  Model Estimate=RMSE
Comparison with prior z score calculators
We sought to compare our z score equations to pre￾viously derived z score equations in use by other
CMR labs, although they have limitations. Figure 7
shows the proposed z score model best fit, z = 2, and
z = − 2 for RV end-diastolic volume (RVEDV) and LV
end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) superimposed on the
same curves using the Buechel model. There is im￾portant additional growth inflection in early toddler￾hood in our model which is not present in the
Buechel model, however both models generally pre￾dict similar z scores for a given volume measurement.
Discussion
This study provides and evaluates a set of z score cal￾culators for normal RV and LV sizes based on robust,
validated measurements from 149 healthy, awake and
free-breathing children 0–12 years old. This is a sig￾nificant contribution to the field, made possible by
the novel MOCO cine workflow enabling very rapid
acquisition of cines for volumetry in children without
sedation, so that all children are scanned prospect￾ively with identical imaging methods and identical
loading conditions (i.e. no sedation). Because somatic
growth and cardiovascular growth are not linearly re￾lated, this dataset is highly necessary and, until now,
has not been feasible due to requirements for breath￾holds and long acquisition times. Some authors have
created more comprehensive sets of z scores, such as
Campens et al. who published an aortic dimension z
score calculator for ages 0–85 [25]. This is well￾meaning but falls short of the goal of creating a
model for a more specific age range, because somatic

growth velocities (measured by height, weight, BSA)
differ significantly from birth to 12 years of age vs.
age 12 and up. Creating a unifying model of cardiac
growth and accompanying z score calculator for car￾diac volumes for children 0–12 years was our specific
goal because other studies describe cardiac chamber
size very well for those 12 years of age and up [16,
17], and somatic growth is incredibly different in chil￾dren age 12 and up, which makes creation of one
unifying model for birth-18 a difficult if not impos￾sible task. In contrast, some authors have created ex￾cellent and well-fitted models for very specific
circumstances that may not be as useful to the
general field, such as Cantinotti et al. who report a
set of z score calculators for cardiac structures from a
group of Caucasian infants and toddlers measured
with echo [26], or Choudhry et al. who rigorously
created a z score calculator for M-mode measure￾ments of the LV in infants with weight 500–2000 g
[27].
Most recently, van der Ven et al. [18] pooled previ￾ously obtained data in a multi-center group of high￾volume pediatric programs to produce volumetry ana￾lyses in 141 healthy children 0–18 years old, using
segmented bSSFP cine imaging. This is an important
contribution, however limitations include ethnicity of

the population (100% Caucasian), and underrepresen￾tation of younger children, with 8% (12/141) under 7
years of age, compared to our prospectively enrolled
population where 61% (91/149) were less than 7 years
of age. Additionally, somewhat heterogeneous imaging
parameters and loading conditions were noted
throughout the study, with some children sedated for
an otherwise clinically indicated musculoskeletal MRI,
some had free-breathing, averaged, segmented cine
imaging, and some had breath-held segmented bSSFP
imaging. Finally, van der Ven et al’s analyses also ex￾cluded papillary muscles and trabeculations from the
blood pool, our and many other centers’ standard
clinical practice, which is a factor when comparing
values between the two studies [24, 28]. Each method
has cited literature supporting its application [29, 30],
thus it is important for the imager to understand
which study to use for accurate z score generation
based on their contouring method [28]. Generally
speaking, our model differs from the Lopez et al.
Pediatric Heart Network echo paper [11], in that we
found a linear relationship between BSA and cardiac
chamber size, whereas they developed a model based
upon a ratio estimator indexed to BSA raised to a fit￾ted power. In addition, we found a constant sex dif￾ference, indicating modestly larger chamber sizes in
males across all age groups.
Our group’s decision to use awake, free-breathing ac￾quisitions using the real-time, re-binning technique
was deliberate, acknowledging that there are both ad￾vantages and disadvantages to this decision. Advan￾tages of this technique are that it allows for rapid
acquisition of volumetry data in all age groups, includ￾ing babies and young children, without the need for
sedation or mechanical ventilation breath-holds. Our
prior work has demonstrated that images can be reli￾ably obtained in a fraction of the time needed for
breath-holding, and yield volumetric measurements
that are clinically comparable to traditional breath￾held techniques [19, 20]. It has been shown that
breath-holding techniques in fact alter normal physi￾ology [31] and can result in significantly different
measurement results when compared to results based
on free-breathing. Because of this, it has been sug￾gested that free-breathing techniques are likely a better
measures of true physiology. An admitted disadvantage
of the free-breathing technique that was chosen is that
most currently available clinical criteria and patient
care guidelines are based on data acquired using trad￾itional breath-hold approaches. While this understand￾ably raises questions regarding the appropriateness of
applying these guidelines using free-breathing data, it
is our belief that future trends in CMR imaging will be
moving in the direction of free-breathing techniques as
acquisition and reconstruction technology continues to
advance, obviating the need for breath-hold imaging.
This will be particularly important in the younger age
pediatric population.

Some have criticized the use of BSA as the independ￾ent variable in a z score calculator as z scores can be
overestimated with very elevated BSA’s; and these au￾thors have advocated for use of lean or ideal body mass
instead of calculated body surface area [32, 33]. Creating
a cohort of “normal” imaging studies for derivation of z
scores is difficult. For cost and utilization reasons, a
retrospective sample of convenience is typically used for
calculation of z scores, which requires fastidious atten￾tion to the clinical details of that patient’s encounter that
led to the imaging to avoid inadvertent inclusion of ab￾normal studies. In addition, patients should be of normal
size (i.e. height, weight and BSA between − 2 and + 2 SD
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Pre￾vention (CDC) growth curves) to avoid skewing the re￾lationship between cardiac structures and somatic
growth [34]. Finally, since various genetic syndromes
predictably affect somatic growth, it is appropriate to
develop separate, condition-specific z scores for
structures of interest, for example in interpreting linear
dimension of girls and women with Turner syndrome,
who are known to be at risk for aortic dilation, dissec￾tion and rupture, but who have small BSA compared to
the general population [35].
There are limitations to this work, most notably the
difficulty in successfully scanning children between 9
and 24 months, with the implication that the size of
cardiac chambers may be mis-represented in this age
group. Our group recruited heavily in the 0–9 months
and 2–4 years categories, representing the last 6
months of the study period, in order to minimize the
impact of this lack of toddler data, reducing the like￾lihood that volume estimates would be mis-estimated.
In addition, the study is limited by the fact that re￾binned MOCO imaging was used, reconstructed on a
gadgetron framework, with subjects that have higher
heart rates on average than the average heart rate of
the cohorts included in the numerous studies which

have found no difference between volumetry from
these sequences and segmented free breathing or
breath hold bSSFP cine imaging.
Conclusion
In conclusion, free-breathing, MOCO cines re-binned
and reconstructed allow for accurate, reliable RV and
LV volumetry in a wide range of infants and children
while awake. Equations predicting fit between RV and
LV normal values and BSA are reported here for pur￾poses of creating z scores.
