Power spectral analysis of the beat-to￾beat variations of heart rate or the heart
period (R–R interval) has become widely
used to quantify cardiac autonomic reg￾ulation (Appel et al., 1989; Task Force of
the European Society of Cardiology and
the North American Society of Pacing and
Electrophysiology, 1996; Berntson et al.,
1997; Denver et al., 2007; Thayler et al.,
2010; Billman, 2011). This technique par￾titions the total variance (the “power”)
of a continuous series of beats into its
frequency components, typically identi￾fying two or three main peaks: Very
Low Frequency (VLF) <0.04 Hz, Low
Frequency (LF), 0.04–0.15 Hz, and High
Frequency (HF) 0.15–0.4 Hz. It should
be noted that the HF peak is shifted to
a higher range (typically 0.24–1.04 Hz)
in infants and during exercise (Berntson
et al., 1997). The HF peak is widely
believed to reflect cardiac parasympathetic
nerve activity while the LF, although more
complex, is often assumed to have a dom￾inant sympathetic component (Task Force
of the European Society of Cardiology and
the North American Society of Pacing and
Electrophysiology, 1996; Berntson et al.,
1997; Billman, 2011). Based upon these
assumptions, Pagani and co-workers pro￾posed that the ratio of LF to HF (LF/HF)
could be used to quantify the chang￾ing relationship between sympathetic and
parasympathetic nerve activities (i.e., the
sympatho-vagal balance) (Pagani et al.,
1984, 1986; Malliani et al., 1991) in both
health and disease. However, this con￾cept has been challenged (Kingwell et al.,
1994; Koh et al., 1994; Hopf et al., 1995;
Eckberg, 1997; Houle and Billman, 1999;
Billman, 2011). Despite serious and largely
under-appreciated limitations, the LF/HF
ratio has gained wide acceptance as a
tool to assess cardiovascular autonomic
regulation where increases in LF/HF are
assumed to reflect a shift to “sympathetic
dominance” and decreases in this index
correspond to a “parasympathetic dom￾inance.” Therefore, it is vital to provide
a critical assessment of the assumptions
upon which this concept is based.
The hypothesis that LF/HF accurately
reflects sympatho-vagal balance rests upon
several interrelated assumptions as follows
(modified from Eckberg, 1997): (1) car￾diac sympathetic nerve activity is a major,
if not the exclusive, factor responsible
for the LF peak of the heart rate power
spectrum; (2) cardiac parasympathetic is
exclusively responsible for the HF peak of
the heart rate power spectrum; (3) dis￾ease or physiological challenges provoke
reciprocal changes in cardiac sympathetic
and parasympathetic nerve activity (i.e.,
increases in cardiac parasympathetic nerve
activity are always accompanied with cor￾responding reductions in cardiac sympa￾thetic nerve activity and vice versa); and
(4) there is a simple linear interaction
between the effects of cardiac sympathetic
and cardiac parasympathetic nerve activity
on heart rate variability (HRV).
As previously noted, frequency domain
analysis of HRV usually reveals two or
more peaks, a lower frequency (<015 Hz)
and a higher frequency peak (>0.15 Hz)
that are often assumed to correspond to
cardiac sympathetic and cardiac parasym￾pathetic neural activity, respectively
(Pagani et al., 1984, 1986; Malliani et al.,
1991). However, accumulating evidence
clearly demonstrates that this assump￾tion is naïve and greatly oversimplifies the
complex non-linear interactions between
the sympathetic and the parasympathetic
divisions of the autonomic nervous sys￾tem (Berntson et al., 1997; Eckberg, 1997;
Parati et al., 2006; Billman, 2009, 2011).
This is particularly true with regards to
the relationship between LF power and
cardiac sympathetic regulation (Randall
et al., 1991; Ahmed et al., 1994; Kingwell
et al., 1994; Hopf et al., 1995; Eckberg,
1997; Houle and Billman, 1999; Parati
et al., 2006; Billman, 2009, 2011).
The LF peak of the heart rate power
spectrum is reduced by at least 50% by
either cholinergic antagonists or selec￾tive parasympathectomy (Akselrod et al.,
1981; Randall et al., 1991; Houle and
Billman, 1999). Importantly, this peak is
not completely eliminated by the combi￾nation of selective denervation and beta￾adrenoceptor blockade (Randall et al.,
1991); ∼25% of the peak remains after this
treatment. As a consequence, LF/HF often
actually increases from baseline values
when both parasympathetic and adren￾ergic nerve activity have been blocked.
For example, using the data reported by
Randall and co-workers (Randall et al.,
1991), LF/HF increased from a baseline
value of 1.1–8.4 when selective parasym￾pathetic denervation was combined with
beta-adrenergic receptor blockade, falsely
suggesting a major shift to sympathetic
dominance! In a similar manner, interven￾tions that would be expected to increase
cardiac sympathetic activity, such as acute
exercise or myocardial ischemia, not only
failed to increase LF power but actually
provoked significant reductions in this
variable (Houle and Billman, 1999), once
again yielding LF/HF values that are dif￾ficult to interpret. Indeed, despite large
increases in heart rate, LF/HF ratio was
largely unaffected by either acute myocar￾dial ischemia, exercise, or the choliner￾gic antagonist atropine sulfate (Houle and
Billman, 1999). Finally, direct recording of
sympathetic nerve activity failed to cor￾relate with LF power in either healthy
subjects or patients with heart failure
(Hopf et al., 1995; Notarius and Floras,
2001; Jardine et al., 2002; Moak et al.,

Billman LF/HF and autonomic balance
2007; Piccirillo et al., 2009), a condition
known to increase cardiac sympathetic
drive (Hasking et al., 1986; Saul et al.,
1988; Watson et al., 2007). Thus, the LF
component of HRV does not provide an
index of cardiac sympathetic drive but
rather reflects a complex and not easily dis￾cernible mix of sympathetic, parasympa￾thetic, and other unidentified factors with
parasympathetic factors accounting for the
largest portion of the variability in this
frequency range. As a consequence, the
physiological basis for LF/HF is difficult to
discern.
Although the vast majority of the clin￾ical and the experimental studies demon￾strate a strong association between HF
power and cardiac parasympathetic activ￾ity (Katona et al., 1970; Appel et al.,
1989; Billman and Hoskins, 1989; Billman
and Dujardin, 1990; Task Force of the
European Society of Cardiology and the
North American Society of Pacing and
Electrophysiology, 1996; Billman, 2009,
2011; Thayler et al., 2010), this concept has
also been challenged (Kollai and Mizsei,
1990; Goldberger et al., 1994; Hedman
et al., 1995; Taylor et al., 2001; Parati et al.,
2006). Unlike LF power and sympathetic
nerve activity, a strong correlation between
HF power and direct recordings of car￾diac parasympathetic activity has been
reported (Chess et al., 1975; Piccirillo et al.,
2009). However, just as parasympathetic
activation exerts profound influences on
the LF component of HRV, sympathetic
neural activity may modulate the HF
component of the R–R interval vari￾ability (Taylor et al., 2001; Cohen and
Taylor, 2002). Taylor et al. (2001) found
that cardioselective beta-adrenergic recep￾tor blockade (drugs that should not indi￾rectly alter vagal outflow via action within
the central nervous system) increased the
amplitude of the respiratory sinus arrhyth￾mia over a wide range of respiratory
frequencies (i.e., the increases were not
restricted to lower frequencies, <0.15 Hz).
They concluded that “cardiac sympathetic
outflow can oppose vagally mediated R-R
interval oscillations and sympathetic block￾ade removes this effect” (Cohen and Taylor,
2002). Based upon these data, sympathetic
nerve activation may alter the HF peak by
perhaps as much as 10%. Thus, differences
in cardiac sympathetic activation during
a physiological challenge (e.g., exercise or
postural changes) in healthy subjects or
that occur as the consequence of car￾diovascular disease (following myocardial
infarction) could restrain vagally medi￾ated changes in HRV. These data suggest
that HF power cannot be solely attributed
to changes in cardiac vagal efferent nerve
traffic, further compromising an accurate
interpretation of the LF/HF ratio.
Accurate interpretation of LF/HF ratio
also depends upon the assumption that
physiological interventions always elicit
reciprocal changes in parasympathetic
and sympathetic nerve activity. However,
following the termination of exercise sym￾pathetic activation remains high despite
the rapid re-activation of cardiac parasym￾pathetic drive (Smith et al., 2005; Billman
and Kukielka, 2007; Billman, 2009).
Furthermore, chemoreceptor activation
by carbon dioxide provokes parallel reduc￾tions in sympathetic and parasympathetic
nerve activity (Eckberg, 1997) while facial
emersion in cold water (activating the
so-called “diving reflex”) increased sympa￾thetic nerve activity yet elicited a profound
bradycardia (Eckberg et al., 1984; Fagius
and Sundlof, 1986). The observation that
heart rate declines, despite increases in
sympathetic nerve activity, highlights the
complex non-linear interactions of the
sympathetic and parasympathetic ner￾vous system, providing an example of
“accentuated antagonism” (Levy, 1971;
Stramba-Badiale et al., 1991; Uijtdehaage
and Thayer, 2000), the dominance of
parasympathetic over sympathetic influ￾ences on cardiac rate. Finally, reciprocal
changes in parasympathetic and sympa￾thetic nerve activity do not always occur
even during the activation of the barore￾ceptor reflex (Eckberg, 1997). Eckberg and
co-workers have shown that, although
small changes in arterial pressure typically
provoke reciprocal changes sympathetic
and parasympathetic nerve activity, large
increases in arterial pressure only pro￾voke increases in parasympathetic nerve
activity without altering the prevailing
sympathetic activity (Eckberg, 1980; Rea
and Eckberg, 1987). Furthermore, auto￾nomic response to baroreceptor reflex
activation depends on whether the pres￾sure changes occur near the threshold or
the saturation point of the response curve;
the same change in pressure can elicit
larger or smaller autonomic responses
depending on how close the prevailing
pressure lies to the threshold (larger)
or saturation (smaller) portion of the
stimulus-response curve (Eckberg, 1980,
1997). As previously noted, changes in
heart rate do not result from the simple
algebraic summation of the sympa￾thetic and parasympathetic nerve activity.
Rather, parasympathetic nerve activation
can completely override even maximal
sympathetic nerve stimulation, provok￾ing large reductions in heart rate in the
face of sympathetic nerve activation as
was previously noted for the diving reflex.
Thus, physiological interventions can elicit
either complex non-linear reciprocal or
parallel changes in either division of the
autonomic nervous system. These com￾plex interactions can profoundly influence
the calculation and the interpretation
of LF/HF.
Mathematical considerations can also
influence LF/HF values. Similar LF/HF
values can be obtained via either exclu￾sive changes in the numerator (i.e., LF),
or the dominator (i.e., HF), or by some
combination of the two, as is illustrated
in Table 1. For example, a doubling of
parasympathetic activity against main￾tained sympathetic nerve activation yields
the identical LF/HF value as a 50% reduc￾tion in sympathetic nerve activity against
a constant background parasympathetic
regulation. Based upon the literature, one
can conclude that parasympathetic nerve
activation contributes to at least 50% of
the LF variability while sympathetic activ￾ity, at best, only contributes 25% to this
variability (Randall et al., 1991). A sub￾stantial portion of the variability in the
LF band also results from other uniden￾tified factors. In a similar fashion, sym￾pathetic nerve activity could contribute
to perhaps as much as 10% of the HF
variability (Taylor et al., 2001; Cohen
and Taylor, 2002). As a consequence,
the effects of changing sympathetic and
parasympathetic activity on the LF/HF are
quite variable and not intuitively obvi￾ous, as is illustrated in Figure 1. This fig￾ure was constructed using the following
formula that was based upon a synthe￾sis of the literature (particularly, Randall
et al., 1991; Taylor et al., 2001; Cohen
and Taylor, 2002), LF = 0.5 parasympa￾thetic + 0.25 sympathetic activity while
HF = 0.9 parasympathetic + 0.1 sym￾pathetic nerve activity. The nerve activity
was varied from baseline (1 arbitrary unit
each) increasing or decreasing by up to a

These numbers were generated using the following formula (derived from a synthesis of the literature, par￾ticularly Randall et al., 1991; Taylor et al., 2001; Cohen and Taylor, 2002): LF/HF = (0.5 parasympathetic +
0.25 sympathetic nerve activity)/(0.9 parasympathetic + 0.1 sympathetic nerve activity). The nerve activity
is reported as arbitrary units where at baseline sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve activity were nor￾malized as 1 arbitrary unit each. The data shown are for baseline and various combinations of doubling (2 ×
baseline) or halving (0.5 × baseline) the autonomic nerve activity.
FIGURE 1 | An illustration of the possible non-linear effects of varying cardiac sympathetic
and cardiac parasympathetic nerve activity on LF/HF. This graph was constructed using the
following formula (derived from a synthesis of the literature, particularly Randall et al., 1991; Taylor
et al., 2001; Cohen and Taylor, 2002): LF/HF = (0.5 parasympathetic + 0.25 sympathetic nerve
activity)/(0.9 parasympathetic + 0.1 sympathetic nerve activity). The nerve activity was varied from
baseline (1 arbitrary unit each) increasing or decreasing by up to a factor of 10 (i.e., from 0.1 to 10
units).
factor of 10. Due to the substantial con￾tribution (accounting for up to 25% of
the variability) (Randall et al., 1991) from
non-neural factors to LF power, very dis￾torted values of LF/HF can be obtained
when both sympathetic and parasym￾pathetic nerve activity are minimal. If
for example, one assumes that LF = 0.5
parasympathetic + 0.25 sympathetic +
0.25 other factors and both parasym￾pathetic and sympathetic nerve activity
are reduced to 1/100 the baseline values,
the calculated LF/HF becomes (0.005 +
0.0025 + 0.25)/(0.009 + 0.001) = 25.75!
Despite the almost complete absence of
cardiac autonomic regulation, this value
could be inappropriately interpreted as
a major shift toward sympathetic dom￾inance. Furthermore, LF/HF cannot be
determined if both sympathetic activity
and parasympathetic nerve activity were
to be abolished completely (i.e., when the
dominator is zero). Finally, mathematical
complications also arise due to the non￾linear relationship between R–R interval
and heart rate; similar changes in heart
rate elicit much greater variability in R–
R interval at lower than at higher heart
rates (Sacha and Pluta, 2008). As a conse￾quence of this non-linear relationship, it
is difficult to separate the changes in HRV
that arise from direct action of cardiac
autonomic nerves from those changes that
result indirectly from neurally induced
changes in average heart rate. This obser￾vation led Sacha and Pluta (2008), to
propose that HRV has both physiologi￾cal and mathematical influences that can
be corrected by the division of HRV by
average R–R interval. Thus, the physio￾logical basis for changes in LF/HF is not
readily discernible and spurious values for
LF/HF can result as a consequence of the
mathematical manipulations of the data.
It should also be noted, that HRV
(and thereby LF/HF) is affected by respi￾ratory parameters and mechanical events
independent of changes in cardiac auto￾nomic nerve activity. The contribution of
mechanical factors (due to stretch of the
atria that results from both changes in
cardiac filling and the changing thoracic
pressure that occur during respiration) to
changes in HRV was first proposed by
Bainbridge (1930). This conclusion is sup￾ported by the observation that heart trans￾plant patients, despite the absence of car￾diac nerves, still exhibit small (∼2–8% of
normal) change in R–R interval associ￾ated with the respiratory cycle (Bernardi
et al., 1989). Taylor et al. (2001) fur￾ther demonstrated that atrial stretch can
exert significant influences on R–R inter￾val in subjects with complete autonomic
blockade. They found that after combined
cholinergic and adrenergic receptor block￾ade slow deep breathing could still provoke
oscillations of ∼120 ms in healthy human
subjects (Taylor et al., 2001). In similar
manner, mechanical distortion (stretch) of
the sinoatrial nodal stretch in pigs without
functional autonomic innervation (vagal

treatment) reduced the HF component of
HRV (Horner et al., 1996).
Respiratory parameters can also pro￾foundly alter heart rate and R–R interval
variability independent of changes in car￾diac autonomic regulation (i.e., against a
constant background level of automatic
regulation) (Angelone and Coulter, 1964;
Davies and Neilson, 1967; Hainsworth,
1974; Melcher, 1976; Hirsch and Bishop,
1981; Brown et al., 1993; Van De Borne
et al., 2001). It is now well established that
increases in respiratory frequency reduce
the amplitude of heart rate oscillations
(Angelone and Coulter, 1964; Melcher,
1976; Hirsch and Bishop, 1981; Brown
et al., 1993) while either increases in
tidal (Davies and Neilson, 1967; Melcher,
1976; Hirsch and Bishop, 1981; Eckberg,
1983; Kollai and Mizsei, 1990; Brown
et al., 1993) or static lung volume
(Hainsworth, 1974) provoke increases in
the R–R interval variability. The facts
are in direct opposiiton to the assump￾tions. Conversely, reductions in respira￾tory frequency increase HRV (Angelone
and Coulter, 1964; Melcher, 1976; Hirsch
and Bishop, 1981; Brown et al., 1993)
while decreases in tidal volume lead to
reductions in the R–R interval variabil￾ity (Davies and Neilson, 1967; Melcher,
1976; Hirsch and Bishop, 1981; Eckberg,
1983; Kollai and Mizsei, 1990; Brown
et al., 1993). Thus, it is critical to con￾trol breathing (paced or timed breathing)
in order to interpret HRV data accurately.
For obvious reasons, it is much more dif￾ficult to control respiratory parameters in
conscious animal than in human studies.
However, these respiratory parameters fre￾quently are not controlled even in human
studies (Brown et al., 1993). Brown and
co-workers (Brown et al., 1993), reviewed
the human literature and found that only
about 51% controlled respiratory rate, and
even fewer studies controlled for tidal vol￾ume (11%). They further reported that
respiratory parameters not only altered
HF power but also strongly influenced
the LF components of the R–R interval
power spectrum, a component that previ￾ously was viewed to vary independently of
changes in respiration (Brown et al., 1993).
Finally, prevailing heart rate can also
influence HRV. There are a number of
studies that report a strong positive cor￾relation between mean R–R interval and
various time domain indices of HRV
(e.g., the standard deviation of normal
beats, SDNN) (Kleiger et al., 1987; Van
Hoogenhuyze et al., 1991; Fleiss et al.,
1992) such that HRV was greater during
longer mean R–R intervals (slower heart
rates) than at shorter mean R–R inter￾vals (faster heart rates). Frequency domain
analysis of HRV is similarly affected by
mean heart rate. Sacha and Pluta (2005)
found that LF was directly related, while
HF was indirectly related, to the average
heart rate of the subject. As a consequence,
they further report that LF/HF varied
depending on heart rate, lower at slower
and higher at faster heart rates. Thus, heart
rate per se can influence LF/HF indepen￾dent of changes cardiac autonomic nerve
activity.
As we have seen, the hypothesis that
LF/HF quantifies “sympatho-vagal bal￾ance” depends upon four interrelated
assumptions, all of which can be proven
to be false. The facts are in direct oppo￾sition to the assumptions. In particu￾lar, the complex nature of LF power, its
exceedingly poor relationship to sympa￾thetic nerve activation, and the non-linear
(and often non-reciprocal) interactions
between sympathetic and parasympathetic
nerve activity that are confounded by the
mechanical effects of respiration and pre￾vailing heart rate, make it impossible to
delineate the physiological basis for LF/HF
with any degree of certainty. Thus, the
LF/HF sympatho-vagal balance hypothe￾sis has been disproven—the preponder￾ance of evidence confirms that LF/HF
data cannot accurately quantify cardiac
“sympatho-vagal balance” either in health
or disease.
