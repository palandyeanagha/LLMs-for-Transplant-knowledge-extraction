Abstract
Sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are oral hypoglycemic agents used to treat patients with diabetes
mellitus. SGLT2 inhibitors block reabsorption of filtered glucose by inhibiting SGLT2, the primary glucose transporter in the
proximal tubular cell (PTC), leading to glycosuria and lowering of serum glucose. We examined the renoprotective effects of
the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin to determine whether blocking glucose entry into the kidney PTCs reduced the
inflammatory and fibrotic responses of the cell to high glucose. We used an in vitro model of human PTCs. HK2 cells (human
kidney PTC line) were exposed to control 5 mM, high glucose (HG) 30 mM or the profibrotic cytokine transforming growth
factor beta (TGFb1; 0.5 ng/ml) in the presence and absence of empagliflozin for up to 72 h. SGLT1 and 2 expression and
various inflammatory/fibrotic markers were assessed. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was used to determine the
binding of phosphorylated smad3 to the promoter region of the SGLT2 gene. Our data showed that TGFb1 but not HG
increased SGLT2 expression and this occurred via phosphorylated smad3. HG induced expression of Toll-like receptor-4,
increased nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid binding for nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) and activator protein 1, induced
collagen IV expression as well as interleukin-6 secretion all of which were attenuated with empagliflozin. Empagliflozin did
not reduce high mobility group box protein 1 induced NF-kB suggesting that its effect is specifically related to a reduction
in glycotoxicity. SGLT1 and GLUT2 expression was not significantly altered with HG or empagliflozin. In conclusion,
empagliflozin reduces HG induced inflammatory and fibrotic markers by blocking glucose transport and did not induce a
compensatory increase in SGLT1/GLUT2 expression. Although HG itself does not regulate SGLT2 expression in our model,
TGFb increases SGLT2 expression through phosphorylated smad3.

Introduction
Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of end stage kidney
disease and its escalating incidence is a challenge to health systems
in both the developed and developing worlds. Treatment options
have increased substantially over the last decade but nevertheless
have not translated into a reduction in the incidence of end stage
kidney disease related to diabetic nephropathy [1], outlining the
continuing need for agents that have a specific effect on the renal
disease associated with diabetes.
Sodium/glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2inh) are
promising (not yet on the market) agents used to achieve glycaemic
control in type 2 diabetes that have the added advantage of not
promoting hyperinsulinaemia, weight gain or inducing hypogly￾caemia [2,3]. Their method of action is to block glucose entry into
the kidney proximal tubular cell, a process known to be integrally
involved in the development of diabetic nephropathy [4–6]. The
resultant glycosuria does not appear to be associated with an
increased risk of urinary tract infections [3,7]. The question
therefore arises as to what effect this blockade of glucose transiting
through the proximal tubular cell will have on the development
and progression of diabetic nephropathy and, for that reason these
studies address the specific cellular effects of SGLT2inh on
proximal tubule cell dysfunction.
While the traditional focus in diabetic nephropathy has been on
histological changes seen in the glomerulus, it has become widely
acknowledged that the changes seen in the tubulointerstitium, and
in particular tubulointerstitial fibrosis, correlate more closely with
deterioration in renal function [8]. In type 2 diabetes, the principal
tubulointerstitial changes seen are those of proximal tubular cell
(PTC) basement membrane thickening, hyperplasia and hyper￾trophy in early diabetes, followed by atrophy of these structures as
the condition progresses [9]. Interstitial fibrosis accompanies these
changes and ultimately correlates with the demise of kidney
function. We have previously defined the direct effects of high
glucose in mediating inflammatory and profibrotic effects in PTCs
[5,10], the specific effects of increased PTC sodium transport in
early diabetes [11,12] and the damaging effects of the hyperplastic
and profibrotic cytokine TGFb on PTC growth and function
[4,13,14]. To this end, destructive sequelae of diabetes have been
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e54442

firmly linked to glucose exposure and intracellular glucose influx in
PTC and it is our hypothesis that these sequelae will be moderated
by blockade of the principal glucose transporters (SGLT2) in the
proximal tubule of the kidney.
The sodium dependent glucose transporters (SGLT), located on
the apical side of the proximal tubule cell, are able to transport
glucose within the cell against a concentration gradient by
transporting glucose concurrently with sodium [15]. A sodium
concentration gradient is provided by the Na-K-adenosine
triphosphatase (Na-K-ATPase) pump located on the basolateral
membrane. Glucose is then passively transported across the
basolateral side of the cell via facilitative glucose transporters
(GLUT) into the interstitium. In the early segments of the
proximal tubule, SGLT2 on the apical membrane is coupled with
GLUT2 on the basolateral side, and together these transporters
reabsorb up to 90% of filtered glucose under normoglycaemic
conditions [16]. The rationale behind SGLT2inh as therapeutic
agents, therefore, is that interference with the principal glucose
transporters in the proximal tubule will enhance glucose excretion
into the urine leading to glycosuria and thereby improved
glycaemic control [15,17]. While the ability of these agents to
induce glycosuria and thereby improve blood glucose levels has
been established in both animal studies and in a number of clinical
trials [18–20], determination of their effects on the renal changes
seen in the context of diabetes has not been assessed. We and
others have explored the effects of SGLT2 blockade on the altered
sodium handling seen in diabetes, which is known to contribute to
both hypertension and glomerular hyperfiltration [12,21] but the
important question that remains to be resolved is whether
SGLT2inh have additional renal benefits (beyond serum glucose
lowering) by blocking excess glucose entry into the proximal tubule
cells under diabetic conditions.
In our studies, we used empagliflozin (BI 10773) a novel
SGLT2inh developed by Boehringer-Ingelheim. It is a very potent
and selective SGLT2inh with an IC50 around 3 nM and Cmax
from clinical dosing around 500 nM (personal communication
with Boehringer-Ingelheim). In HEK293 cells (a human embry￾onic kidney cell line) overexpressing human SGLT2, empagliflozin
significantly blocked 14C alpha methyl glucose uptake [22]. In our
studies, concentrations used were 100 nM and 500 nM based on
recommendations by Boehringer-Ingelheim as these doses effec￾tively and selectively block SGLT2 without significant inhibition of
SGLT1. In phase I clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes
mellitus, once-daily empagliflozin increased urinary glucose
excretion resulting in dose-proportional reductions in fasting
plasma glucose and mean daily glucose levels. empagliflozin was
not associated with significant hypoglycemic episodes or other
clinically important adverse events and phase three clinical trials
are due to report [18].
Materials and Methods
Cell Culture
HK2 cells, a primary human proximal tubular cell line
(American Type Culture Collection), were grown in Keratinocyte
Serum Free Media (KSFM) supplemented with bovine pituitary
extract 20–30 mg/ml and epidermal growth factor 0.1–0.2 ng/ml
(Gibco, NY, USA). Cell culture media was changed every 48
hours. These cells were grown at 37uC in a humidified 5% CO2
incubator and were subcultured at 50–80% confluence using
0.05% trypsin - EDTA (Gibco, NY, USA). The SGLT2inh
empagliflozin was generously provided by Boehringer-Ingelheim.
When 80% confluent, cells were exposed to 5 mM glucose,
30 mM D-glucose, 30 mM D-glucose plus 100 nM SGLT2inh
and 30 mM D-glucose plus 500 nM SGLT2inh for up to 72 h
then harvested. For the TGFb experiments, a final concentration
of 0.5 nM recombinant human TGFb1 (R&D systems, MN, USA)
was used instead of glucose. Recombinant high mobility group box
protein 1 (ProteinOne, MD, USA) was used at a final concentra￾tion of 50 ng/ml. Preliminary viability studies were conducted
using a commercial MTS assay CellTiter 96H AQueous (Promega,
WI, USA) which showed no significant cell toxicity at the
concentrations used.
Western Blot Analysis
Cells collected were 95% confluent and the cell pellet was
resuspended in cell lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl,
150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA (pH 7.4), 0.5% Triton-X100, and
protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany).
Cell lysate was spun at 13000 rpm at 4uC for 5 minutes and stored
at 220uC. Protein quantification (Bio-Rad, CA, USA) was carried
out to determine the protein concentration of the cell lysate. 50–
80 mg total cell protein was mixed with 6x Laemmli sample buffer
containing mercaptoethanol and heated at 95uC for 10 minutes.
Samples were then analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacryl￾amide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using a 10% gel and
electroblotted to Hybond Nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech, Bucks, UK). Membranes were blocked in
Tris-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween-20 (TTBS) in 5%
skim milk for 2–3 hours and then incubated overnight at 4uC with
the following primary antibodies – SGLT1 and SGLT2 1:300
(Santa Cruz, CA, USA), GLUT2 1:500 (Millipore), collagen IV
1:5000 (Abcam Ltd, Cambridge), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) 3 ug/
ml (Invitrogen, CA,USA) in TTBS (Tris Buffered saline with 0.2%
Tween) containing 5% skim milk. Membranes were washed with
TTBS and incubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugated
secondary antibody. Proteins were visualized using the enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Pharma￾cia Biotech, Bucks, UK). All membranes were reprobed with b
actin 1:1000 (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and results were corrected for
actin as a loading control and analysed using Image J software
(Java based software program, NIH).
Nuclear Extraction and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift
Assay (EMSA)
Nuclear extracts were prepared using NucBusterTM Protein
Extraction Kit (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) as per manufac￾turer’s instructions. The DIG Gel Shift Kit (Roche Applied
Science, Indianapolis, US), was used in the EMSA. In brief, 25 mg
of nuclear extract were incubated with 1 mg poly [d (I–C)] as the
non specific competitor, 1 mg poly L-lysine in a binding buffer
(100 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM (NH4)2SO4,
5 mM DTT, Tween 20, 1% w/v, 150 mM KCl) and dig-labeled
AP-1 (59-CGC TTG ATG AGT CAG CCG GAA-39) and dig￾labeled NF-kB (59-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-39)
consensus oligonucleotide (Promega, WI, USA) for 30 minutes at
room temperature. The reaction mixture was electrophoresed
through 6% polyacrylamide gels, transferred onto nylon positively
charged membrane (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, USA)
and then crosslinked using an UV-transilluminator for 3 minutes.
The membrane was subjected to immunological detection using
anti-Digoxigenin-AP conjugate and chemiluminescence. Results
were analyzed using Image J software and shift bands were
measured.

Interleukin 6 (IL6) ELISA
HK-2 cells were seeded at 156104 cells/well in a 24 well plate.
Cells were treated for 48 h and supernatants were collected,
centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 5 minutes and stored at –20uC until
IL6 levels were determined with an immunoassay kit assay
(Invitrogen, CA, USA) as per manufacturer’s instructions and read
using a microplate reader at 450 nm. Cell lysate protein
concentration was determined using Bio-Rad Protein assay and
IL6 levels were corrected for protein content per well.
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed
using Pierce Agarose ChIP kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, IL USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, 26106 cells
were cross-linked in 1% formaldehyde after exposure to control
media and 0.5 ng/ml TGFb for 72 hours. Cells were then lysed
and chromatin was sheared using micronuclease digestion 200- to
1000-bp DNA fragments. Input DNA was stored for subsequent
quantitation. Remaining sheared DNA was incubated with anti￾phosphosmad3 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). Normal
Rabbit IgG and anti-RNA polymerase II antibody were used as
negative and positive control respectively. The crosslink of
immunoprecipitated protein-DNA samples were then reversed,
and DNA samples were purified using spin columns. Phosphos￾mad3 binding sites to the SGLT2 promoter region were analysed
using quantitative real time PCR with SYBR green (ABI Prism
7900 HT). The primers used were forward primer 59-G T C T A
A G G C G C A G T C T G A G G-39 and reverse primer 59-C T
G C A C G C T T G G A G T A G A T G-39). PCR conditions
were 95uC for 5 min and then 40 cycles at 94uC (40 s), 50uC (40 s)
and 72uC (90 s). Samples were done in triplicate and data is
expressed as % of input values. The amplified PCR product was
analysed on a 1.2%agarose gel.
Statistical Analysis
All the results are expressed as normalised results and are a
percentage of the mean6standard error of control values.
Experiments were performed at least in triplicate or as detailed
in the text with n reflecting the number of separate experiments.
Statistical comparisons between groups were made by analysis of
variance (ANOVA) or unpaired t-tests where appropriate.
Analyses were performed using the software package, Statview
version 5.0 (Abacus Concepts Inc., Berkley, CA, USA). P values
,0.05 considered significant.
Results
SGLT2 Expression is not Regulated by High Glucose but is
Increased with TGFb1 via Phosphosmad3 Signaling
SGLT2 is the predominant glucose cotransporter in human
kidney proximal tubular cells. In order to determine whether
SGLT2 expression is regulated by high glucose in HK2 cells, they
were incubated with 30 mM glucose for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. We
found that SGLT2 expression did not change with high glucose at
48 h as shown in Figure 1A. Experiments were repeated at 24 h
and 72 h to ensure that we are not missing the right time point and
this also showed no change (data not shown). This result implies
that high glucose does not regulate SGLT2 expression at a protein
level which would suggest that acute hyperglycaemia itself is not
sufficient to potentiate further glucose reabsorption. High glucose
in itself increases TGFb1, a prominent profibrotic cytokine
responsible for laying down extracellular matrix in diabetic
nephropathy. We have previously shown that HK2 cells exposed
to high glucose increases secreted TGFb1 in vitro [5]. Motif
searching identified Smad 3 and 4 binding sites in the promoter
region of SGLT2, which, together suggest that SGLT2 expression
is under the direct control of the classic TGFb signalling pathway.
Hence we looked at whether TGFb1 regulated SGLT2 expression
by exposing HK2 cells to recombinant human TGFb1 for 72 h.
We found that TGFb1 increased SGLT2 protein expression to
146.7616.5% of control after 72 h as shown in Figure 1B
(p,0.05). Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies with real time
PCR confirmed significantly increased binding of phosphorylated
smad3 to the promoter region of the SGLT2 gene with TGFb1
treated cells showing a % input of 156.369.3 compared to control
(p,0.05). This is also represented visually on a agarose gel as
shown in Figure 1C.
SGLT1 and GLUT2 Expression is not Altered with High
Glucose and SGLT2 Inhibition
Glucose reabsorption in the human proximal tubular cell is
affected by other glucose transporters. SGLT2, situated in the S1
segment, is a low-affinity high-capacity transporter reabsorbing up
to 90% of filtered glucose. SGLT1, situated in the S3 segment, is a
high-affinity low-capacity transporter reabsorbing the remaining
10% [15]. GLUT2 is a facilitative transporter located at the
basolateral membrane. So, it is important to measure SGLT1 and
GLUT2 expression (the minor glucose transporters) in order to
ascertain whether high glucose or SGLT2inh is causing a
compensatory increase in these protein expression as any
compensatory increase in expression of SGLT1 or GLUT2 may
negate the effect of SGLT2 inhibition by allowing glucose to enter
the cells. We found that SGLT1 and GLUT2 protein expression
was not significantly altered with high glucose or the SGLT2inh as
shown in Figure 2A and B. This implies that blocking SGLT2 with
empagliflozin is unlikely to causes a compensatory increase in the
other glucose transporter on HK2 cells in our experiments.
SGLT2inh Reverses High Glucose Induced TLR4
Expression
TLR4 is a ligand activated membrane bound receptor and is
involved in NF-kB mediated inflammation After 24 hours, high
glucose induced TLR4 expression to 144.1618.1% of control
(p,0.05). The SGLT2inh at both concentrations significantly
inhibited high glucose induced TLR4 expression to 97.268.2%
and 64.4612.6% respectively, p,0.05 as shown in Figure 3A.
This would suggest that the increase in glucose induced TLR4 is
likely to be due to intracellular glucose entry rather than glucose
acting as a TLR4 ligand as it was reversed with empagliflozin.
SGLT2inh Reverses High Glucose (but not High Mobility
Group Box Protein 1) Induced NF-kB Binding
After exposing HK2 cells to high glucose for 72 h, high glucose
induced NF-kB binding increase as expected to 161.1616.4% of
control (p,0.05). Empagliflozin at a final concentration of
500 nM significantly inhibited high glucose induced NF-kB
binding to 91.7614.9% of control, p,0.05. This is shown in
figure 3B. In order to determine that these changes are specific to
glucose, we repeated these experiments using recombinant high
mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1), as we have previously
shown that it is a potent stimulus of NF-kB binding in these cells
[23]. We demonstrate that in the absence of high glucose
empagliflozin does not reduce HMGB1 induced NF-kB binding,
reflecting the specificity of glucose blockade. This is shown in
Figure 3C.

SGLT2inh Reduces High Glucose Induced IL-6 Secretion
IL-6 is a secreted proinflammatory cytokine and after 48 h, high
glucose induced IL-6 secretion to 151.0626.1% of control,
p,0.05. Empagliflozin at 100 nM final concentration reduced
high glucose induced secreted IL-6 to 92.0611.7% of control,
p,0.05. Similarly, at 500 nM there was a reduction of 1L-6 to
116.5619.6% which was comparable to control values as shown
in Figure 3D.
SGLT2inh Reverses High Glucose Induced AP-1 Binding
Both NF-kB and AP-1 are key transcription factors mediating
the fibrotic and inflammatory pathways in HK2 cells exposed to
high glucose [5,10] Similar to NF-kB, 72 h of exposure to high
glucose induced AP-1 binding as expected to 166.7627.6% of
control, p,0.05. Empagliflozin at a final concentration of 100 nM
and 500 nM significantly inhibited high glucose induced AP-1
binding to 91.7614.9% of control and 87.9618.5% of control
respectively, p,0.05 as shown in Figure 4. This would imply that
intracellular glucose levels determine the activity of both these
transcription factors.
SGLT2inh Reverses High Glucose Induced CIV Expression
CIV is a basement membrane matrix protein which is induced
by high glucose in HK2 cells. When cells were incubated for 48 h,
high glucose induced CIV expression to 185.6642.8% of control,
p,0.05. Empagliflozin at 100 nM final concentration reduced
high glucose induced CIV expression to 91.8629.8% of control,
P,0.05. At 500 nM, empagliflozin reduced CIV expression to
110.8621.0% which was comparable to control values. This is
shown in Figure 5.
Figure 3. The effect of SGLT2inh on inflammatory markers. SGLT2inh significantly reverses high glucose induced TLR4 expression at 24 hours
(A) and NF-kB binding at 72 hours (B). This was specific to blockade of glucose entry into the cell as another stimulus of NF-kB binding like HMGB1
was not affected by SGLT2 inhibition (C). SGLT2inh also reduced high glucose induced IL-6 secretion (D). HK2 cells were exposed to 5 mM (ctrl),
30 mM high glucose, 50 ng/ml recombinant HMGB1 and the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin at 100 nM and 500 nM final concentration. TLR4
expression was assessed with western blot and NF-kB binding was measured using EMSA. For the HMGB1 experiments, cells were pretreated with the
SGLT2 inhibitor for 24 hours then exposed to recombinant HMGB1 for 2 hours. IL-6 was measured in the supernatant using a commercial ELISA kit

Discussion
SGLT2 inhibitors lower serum glucose in type 2 diabetes
mellitus but blocking the reabsorption of glucose which occurs in
the kidney proximal tubular cells via SGLT2 (the main
transporter). This begs the question – does this protect the
proximal tubular cells from glycotoxicity? Our studies initially
looked at whether high glucose altered the expression of the
SGLTs in HK2 cells, a human kidney proximal tubule cell line.
The findings suggest that there is no regulation of these glucose
transporters in response to a high glucose milieu, as high glucose
did not alter the protein expression of SGLT1 or SGLT2.
Although SGLT1 is not the main glucose transporter in the early
proximal tubule, we measured its expression in the context of
SGLT2inh to assess whether there was any compensatory increase
in glucose transport via SGLT1. We presume that this is unlikely
given the lack of increase in SGLT1 expression with high glucose
when combined with a SGLT2inh.
Interestingly, recombinant human TGFb1 upregulated SGLT2
at a protein level (in normal glucose conditions). TGFb is
recognised as the prototypical fibrogenic and hypertrophic
cytokine that has been found to stimulate PTCs to produce key
extracellular matrix molecules including type I collagen, type IV
collagen, fibronectin and laminin [24] and is intrinsic to the
development of diabetic nephropathy. Virtually all of the
molecular mediators and intracellular signalling pathways that
have been identified in diabetic nephropathy, have also been
found to stimulate renal TGFb activity as an intermediary step
including: high glucose concentration [25], reactive oxygen species
[26], angiotensin II [27], exposure to advanced glycation end￾products [28], protein kinase C activation [29] and endothelin
[30]. The classical TGFb signalling pathway commences when
TGFb dimers bind to a type II receptor which recruits and
phosphorylates a type I receptor, followed by the recruitment and
phosphorylation of Smad3. Smad3 then binds to Smad4 to form a
heterodimeric complex that acts as a transcription factor for
various genes. Our preliminary data has shown that HK2 cells
exposed to TGFb1 show an increase in SGLT2 expression and
motif searching has identified Smad 3 and 4 binding sites in the
promoter region of SGLT2 and this was confirmed by the
chromatin immunoprecipitation studies which, together suggest

binding, HK2 cells were incubated for up to 72 h with 5 mM (ctrl) media, 30 mM high glucose and SGLT2inh at 100 nM and 500 nM. AP-1 binding
was assessed using EMSA. High glucose induced AP-1 binding and the SGLT2inh at both concentrations significantly inhibited this increase.

that SGLT2 expression is under the direct control of the classic
TGFb signalling pathway via smad3. This is a novel finding
linking TGFb action to SGLT2 expression in a potentially vicious
cycle whereby TGFb increases the expression of SGLT2, allowing
for an increase in intracellular glucose leading to further TGFb
production.
We have also uniquely demonstrated that the SGLT2 inhibitor
empagliflozin caused a reduction in high glucose induced TLR4,
CIV and IL6 expression in addition to a suppression of high
glucose induced DNA binding activity of NF-kB and AP-1. TLRs
are germline-encoded innate immune receptors expressed in
leukocytes and kidney cells, and are involved in inflammation
upon activation by exogenous (pathogen derived lipopolysaccha￾rides) or endogenous (tissue derived) ligands. We have shown that
endogenous ligands to TLR4 such as fibronectin, heat shock
protein 70 (HPS70) and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) are
upregulated in the presence of high glucose [5,10]. The TLR4
signaling pathway converges at NF-kB an important immuno￾modulatory protein. As these factors are inextricably linked to the
inflammatory and fibrotic process in diabetic nephropathy, it
would suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors may be useful in limiting
glucose induced renal inflammation above and beyond its serum
glucose lowering effects. A consistent overall effect was seen
whereby SGLT2 inhibitors alleviated the damaging effects of high
glucose but these occurred at different concentrations of the
inhibitor, reflecting presumed differences in intracellular glucose
concentrations at which these effects occur. With respect to NF￾kB, these results are likely because of reductions in intracellular
glycotoxicity rather than non specific effects of empagliflozin as
NF-kB binding was not reduced when another stimulus like
HMGB1 was used. This would suggest that injurious pathways
unrelated to glycotoxity may not be altered by SGLT2 inhibition.
Hence these in vitro findings may or may not be predictive of in vivo
findings. In vivo, although SGLT2 inhibitors may protect the
proximal tubular cells from glycotoxicity, the other parts of the
kidney like the vasculature and the glomeruli would still be
subjected to existing serum glucose levels.
In conclusion, our studies are the first to provide in vitro
evidence in human proximal tubular cells to suggest that the
SGLT2inh, empagliflozin, is able to limit high glucose induced
inflammatory and fibrotic markers most likely due to blocking
glucose entry into the cell and that TGFb1 (but not high glucose)
regulates SGLT2 expression via the classical signalling pathway
involving phosphorylated smad3. Clinical studies will be required
to ascertain whether SGLT2 inhibitors offer additional renal
protection compared to other oral hypoglycaemic agents used to
treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. If additional renoprotection above
and beyond plasma glucose lowering is evident, then SGLT2
inhibitors may be the oral hypoglycaemic agent of choice given its
other favourable features in regard to weight and adverse
hypoglycaemia.
