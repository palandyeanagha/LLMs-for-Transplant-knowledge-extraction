Abstract
Multiple myeloma (MM) displays an NFkB activity-related gene expression signature and about 20% of primary MM samples
harbor genetic alterations conducive to intrinsic NFkB signaling activation. The relevance of blocking the classical versus the
alternative NFkB signaling pathway and the molecular execution mechanisms involved, however, are still poorly
understood. Here, we comparatively tested NFkB activity abrogation through TPCA-1 (an IKK2 inhibitor), BAY 11-7082 (an
IKK inhibitor poorly selective for IKK1 and IKK2), and MLN4924 (an NEDD8 activating enzyme (NAE)-inhibitor), and analyzed
their anti-MM activity. Whereas TPCA-1 interfered selectively with activation of the classical NFkB pathway, the other two
compounds inhibited classical and alternative NFkB signaling without significant discrimination. Noteworthy, whereas
TPCA-1 and MLN4924 elicited rather mild anti-MM effects with slight to moderate cell death induction after 1 day BAY 11-
7082 was uniformly highly toxic to MM cell lines and primary MM cells. Treatment with BAY 11-7082 induced rapid cell
swelling and its initial effects were blocked by necrostatin-1 or the ROS scavenger BHA, but a lasting protective effect was
not achieved even with additional blockade of caspases. Because MLN4924 inhibits the alternative NFkB pathway
downstream of IKK1 at the level of p100 processing, the quite discordant effects between MLN4924 and BAY 11-7082 must
thus be due to blockade of IKK1-mediated NFkB-independent necrosis-inhibitory functions or represent an off-target effect
of BAY 11-7082. In accordance with the latter, we further observed that concomitant knockdown of IKK1 and IKK2 did not
have any major short-term adverse effect on the viability of MM cells.

Introduction
Transcription factors of the nuclear factor of kappa light
polypeptide gene enhancer in B cells (NFkB) family are
ubiquitously expressed and activated by a variety of stimuli
including proinflammatory cytokines and environmental stressors
[1]. NFkBs control the transcription of hundreds of genes, often
encoding for proteins involved in immune regulation but which
are also important for cell survival, differentiation and prolifera￾tion of non-immune cells [1]. Accordingly, aberrant activity of
NFkBs plays a pivotal role in many diseases of the immune system
but has also been implicated in aspects of tumor development and
metastasis [2,3]. NFkBs elicit protumoral effects by driving
illegitimate gene expression in malignant cells but they are also
involved in the maintenance and activity of a tumor promoting
microenvironment consisting of, for example, reactive fibroblasts
and infiltrating immune cells [4]. NFkB inhibition is therefore
considered an attractive option for the development of novel
tumor therapies and the antitumoral effects of some established
anti-cancer drugs are possibly directly or indirectly related to
inhibition of NFkBs [5].
NFkBs are homo- or heterodimers of the structurally related
subunits p65 (RelA), RelB, cRel, p50 and p52. The latter two are
initially expressed as precursor proteins (p105/NFkB1 and p100/
NFkB2) that contain a C-terminal autoinhibitory domain [1–3]. In
non-stimulated cells, masking of the nuclear localization sequence
(NLS) of NFkBs retains them in the cytoplasm. This is achieved
either through formation of a ternary complex with proteins of the
inhibitor of kB (IkB) family or in the case of p100-containing
NFkBs by intramolecular interaction of the NLS with the
inhibitory domain of p100 [1]. The two structural modes of
NFkB inhibition are related to two prototypic NFkB-activating
signaling pathways triggering demasking of the NLS by degrada￾tion of IkBs (classical NFkB pathway) or by limited processing of
p100 to p52 (alternative NFkB pathway). The classical pathway is
stimulated by a wide variety of inducers and typically involves the

following, partly overlapping steps: i) stimulus-induced oligomer￾ization of E3 ligases of the tumor necrosis factor (TRAF)- and
inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP)-families and non-degradative ubiqui￾tination of various signaling intermediates, ii) recruitment and
activation of the IkB kinase (IKK) complex which contains
amongst others IKK2 and NEMO, iii) activation of MAP3Ks,
iv) MAP3K-mediated phosphorylation and activation of IKK2, v)
IKK2-mediated phosphorylation of IkBs, vi) K48 ubiquitination
and proteasomal degradation of phospho-IkBs, and finally nuclear
translocation of the released NFkB dimer and fine-tuning of its
activity by various modifications [1]. Activation of the alternative
NFkB pathway is induced by some members of the TNF ligand
family, for example TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK)
and B cell activating factor (BAFF), as well as some viral proteins.
Stimulation of the alternative NFkB pathway is based upon
inhibition of constitutive degradation of the MAP3K NFkB￾inducing kinase (NIK) by the concerted action of TRAF2,
TRAF3, cIAP1 and cIAP2 and subsequent accumulation of newly
synthesized NIK. The latter in turn phosphorylates and activates
IKK1 which marks p100 by phosphorylation for limited process￾ing by the proteasome, resulting in p52-containing NFkB dimers
which can translocate into the nucleus [1]. Notably, the two NFkB
pathways are functionally connected by various mechanisms but
nevertheless elicit clearly distinguishable cellular effector pro￾grams.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
Bone marrow aspirates from MM patients were obtained at the
University Hospital of Wu¨rzburg, Department of Internal
Medicine II, within the frame of diagnostically indicated
aspirations and after informed written consent of the respective
patients. Permission was granted by the Ethics Committee of the
Medical Faculty, University of Wu¨rzburg, Wu¨rzburg, Germany
(ref. no. 18/09).
Cell Lines, Reagents and Antibodies
HEK293, HT29, and MM.1S cells were obtained from LGC
Standards, RPMI8226, AMO1, U266, L363, JJN3, OPM2, and
KMS-12-BM cells were obtained from the German Collection of
Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.
INA6 cells were a gift from Martin Gramatzki (Kiel, Germany)
[6]. All cell lines were cultivated in RPMI1640 medium (PAA,
Co¨lbe, Germany), containing 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine
serum (PAA). INA6 cells were cultivated in medium supplemented
with 10 ng/ml recombinant human IL6 (ImmunoTools, Frie￾soythe, Germany). The isolation and culture of CD138-selected
primary MM cells, as well as of primary bone marrow stromal cells
(BMSCs) is described in detail in [7]. The Flag-tagged variants of
soluble TNF and TWEAK were produced in HEK293 cells and
purified by affinity chromatography on anti-Flag mAb M2-agarose
(Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany). TPCA-1 and Bay 11-7082
were obtained from Tocris Bioscience (Ellisville, MO, USA) and
Calbiochem (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), respectively. Necros￾tatin-1 and TRAIL were purchased from Enzo Life Sciences
(Lo¨rrach, Germany), and z-VAD-fmk from Bachem (Weil am
Rhein, Germany). MLN4924 was obtained from Active Biochem
(Maplewood, NJ, USA), butylhydroxyanisole, cycloheximide and
propidium iodide were from Sigma-Aldrich. Suppliers of antibod￾ies: NIK (4994) and phospho-IkBa (2859): Cell Signaling
Technology (Frankfurt am Main, Germany); p100 (05-361):
Merck Millipore (Darmstadt, Germany); tubulin (MS-581-P):
Dunn Labortechnik (Asbach, Germany); IkBa (sc847) and p65

Annexin V-FITC (31490013) was purchased from ImmunoTools
(Frisoythe, Germany).
ELISA
Cells were seeded in triplicate in 96-well plates, treated for
30 min with the indicated inhibitors and subsequently stimulated
with recombinant TNF. Supernatants were collected and cleared
by centrifugation, and the IL8 content was determined with a
commercial ELISA kit (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Western Blotting
Cells were washed once with PBS and lysed in 46 Laemmli
sample buffer supplemented with complete protease inhibitor
(Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and phosphatase inhibitor cock￾tails II and III (Sigma-Aldrich). Samples were subjected to
sonification, heated to 96uC for 5 min and used for SDS-PAGE.
Tansfer to nitrocellulose membranes was performed by wet￾blotting, blots were incubated with TBS or PBS containing 0.1%
Tween 20 and 5% milk powder prior to sequential incubation
with primary antibodies and appropriate horseradish peroxidase￾conjugated secondary antibodies (Dako (Hamburg, Germany)
and Cell Signaling Technology). For visualization of antigen￾antibody complexes the ECL Western Blotting detection system
from Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific (Bonn, Germany) was
used.
Determination of Cellular Viability
Multiple myeloma cells were seeded in 96-well plates and
stimulated with the reagents as described in the figure legends.
Metabolically active cells were finally quantified using a standard
MTT assay protocol. Cellular viability was calculated from the
percentage of the viability of untreated cells (100%) and
background staining of completely dead cells (0%). The latter
was achieved through a toxic mixture of CD95L, TRAIL,
cycloheximide and Bay 11-7082. The alamarBlue viability assay
was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Morphosys, Martinsried, Germany) on between 25,000 (L363)
or 40,000 (JJN3, MM.1S) transfected and purified cells per well
independent experiments. (D) HT29 cells (20,000/well, 96 well-plate, triplicate values) were pretreated with the IKK inhibitors Bay 11-7082 (30 mM) or
TPCA-1 (20 mM) for 30 min and were then stimulated with 100 ng/ml TNF for 6 h. The IL8 content of supernatants was subsequently determined by
ELISA. To minimize the background signal related to constitutive IL8 production, medium was changed prior to inhibitor treatment. (E) The effects of
TPCA-1 and Bay 11-7082 on TNF-induced phosphorylation and degradation of IkBa were analyzed in KMS-12-BM myeloma cells as described under
‘‘A’’; n.s. = non specific. (F) Equivalent analysis on TNF-induced IL8 production as described in ‘‘D’’ using the RPMI8226 MM cell line. For statistical
analysis of data shown in C, D and F one-way ANOVA with a Tukey post-test was performed. Asterisks indicate p-values#0.01.

(96-well plates) seeded one day after transfection and measured
between 3 and 6 days post-transfection.
Flow Cytometry
Cells were stimulated as described in the figure legends and then
washed with cold annexin V buffer (10 mM HEPES, 140 mM
NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4). Cells were resuspended in 50 ml
annexin V buffer supplemented with 1 ml annexin V-FITC and
1 ml propidium iodide solution (1 mg/ml). After 30 min incuba￾tion on ice in the dark 100 ml annexin V buffer was added to the
cell suspension which was then analyzed using a FACSCalibur
(BD Biosciences). Primary MM cells in co-culture with bone
marrow stromal cells were carefully dislodged by pipetting, washed
with PBS and incubated with annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide
solution for 15 min prior to flow cytometric analysis.
Brightfield Microscopy
For the time lapse experiments 50,000 cells were stimulated in
100 ml medium as indicated and transferred to a chamber slide
with a cover slip for microscopy. With heating lamps and a heat
sensor the temperature was held constant at 37uC and pictures
were captured using a Leica DM IL microscope (Wetzlar,
Germany). The pictures of differentially treated cells were
captured using an EVOS xl microscope (AMG, Bothell, WA,
USA).
Immunofluorescence Microscopy
HT29 cells (40,000) were seeded on 8-chamber glass slides (BD
Bioscience). After adherence, cells were either pretreated for
30 min with Bay 11-7082 (30 mM) or TPCA-1 (20 mM), or
remained untreated. Subsequently, cells were stimulated for 1
hour with TNF (100 ng/ml) and stained for immunofluorescence
analysis as described [8] using anti-p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnol￾ogy) and Cy-3-labeled anti-rabbit (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany)
antibodies. Samples were imaged using an EVOS fl microscope
(AMG). Mean nuclear and cytoplasmic fluorescence intensities
were determined with the ImageJ software to calculate the ratios of
nuclear to cytoplasmic fluorescence.
Statistical Analysis
Error bars shown in the various graphs represent standard error
of the mean (SEM). Statistical analyses were performed using
GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA),
with details described in the legends to the respective figures. All
data shown are representative for at least two independent
experiments.
Sequences
Stealth siRNAs were purchased from Life Technologies
(Darmstadt, Germany) and used at a final concentration of
3 mM (per duplex) in the electroporation mix. The nucleotide
sequences (sense direction) for the stealth siRNAs were: GCAUU￾CAGCUUGACUUGGAGAGAUA (against human IKK1),
CGAACUGAGGGUGACAGUCAGGAAA (against human
IKK2), and AUUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUAGCUA (non￾specific). Electroporation conditions, and subsequent purification
of strongly transfected cells are described in detail in [9].
Results and Discussion
Bay 11-7082 is Highly Toxic at Concentrations of Effective
IKK Inhibition
To differentiate between contributions of the classical and the
alternative NFkB pathway for the survival of multiple myeloma
(MM) cells, we used 2-[(aminocarbonyl)amino]-5-(4-fluorophenyl)-
3-thiophenecarboxamide (TPCA-1), an inhibitor with high pref￾erence for IKK2 over IKK1, and Bay 11-7082, an inhibitor with
comparable activity against both IKKs. Initially, we used the colon
carcinoma cell line HT29 to monitor TNF-induced phosphory￾lation and degradation of IkBa, two events crucially dependent on
IKK2 activity, and of TWEAK-induced processing of p100, which
is mediated by IKK1, in order to determine functionally active
inhibitor concentrations. Treatment with 10 mM TPCA-1 was
sufficient to largely block TNF-induced phosphorylation and
degradation of IkBa without showing an inhibitory effect on
TWEAK-stimulated p100 processing (Fig. 1A,B). Some reduction
of p100 expression levels without concomitant increase in p52 was
observed after TPCA-1 treatment (Fig. 1B), which is likely due to
the fact that NFKB2 (the gene encoding p100) is a target gene of
the classical NFkB pathway [10]. Bay 11-7082 inhibited both
TWEAK-induced p100 processing and TNF-induced phosphor￾ylation and degradation of IkBa. Significant blockade of both
NFkB pathways was achieved at concentrations between 30 to
100 mM of Bay 11-7082 (Fig. 1A,B). In accordance with their
inhibitory effect on TNF-induced degradation of IkBa, p65
nuclear translocation and upregulation of IL8, which is encoded
by a target gene of the classical NFkB pathway, were efficiently
blocked by TPCA-1 and Bay 11-7082 (Fig. 1C,D). Both inhibitors
displayed a similar dose dependency on TNF-induced phosphor￾ylation and degradation of IkBa in the MM cell line KMS-12-BM
and also prevented upregulation of IL8 in the MM cell line
RPMI8226 (Fig. 1E,F).
We next analyzed the effects of TPCA-1 and Bay 11-7082 on
MM cell viability in a panel of 10 MM cell lines as well as in
primary MM samples. Treatment with TPCA-1 [20 mM] had
virtually no effect after 4 h and entailed moderate viability
Figure 3. The mechanism of Bay 11-7082-induced MM cell death involves necrosis. (A) MM.1S and KMS-12-BM cells were treated with
30 mM Bay 11-7082 and analyzed by time-lapse video microscopy. Pictures shown represent typical stages of cells undergoing Bay 11-7082-induced
cell death within 3 h. (B) Cells were pretreated for 30 min with BHA (50 mM), necrostatin-1 (90 mM) or remained untreated and were then challenged
with 30 mM Bay 11-7082 for 2 h. Cells were finally photographed (B, arrows indicate swollen cells and the plasma membrane). (C) MM cells were either
left untreated or pretreated for 1 h with BHA (50 mM), necrostatin-1 (90 mM), z-VAD-fmk (100 mM) or both necrostatin-1 and z-VAD-fmk. Cells were
then challenged with 15 mM Bay 11-7082 for 1 h (KMS-12-BM) or 2 h (MM.1S) followed by annexin V-FITC/PI staining and FACS analysis. (D) MM.1S
and KMS-12-BM cells were pretreated in triplicates for 30 min with the indicated combinations of BHA (50 mM), necrostatin-1 (90 mM) and z-VAD-fmk
(100 mM), exposed for 2 h to 30 mM Bay 11-7082 and then analyzed for viability using the MTT assay. For statistical analysis a one-way ANOVA with a
Tukey post-test was performed. Experimental settings that display significant protection against Bay 11-7082 induced cell death (p-values#0.01) are
indicated by asterisks.

decreases (0–50%) after 18 h in most MM cell lines (up to 75% in
INA6 and OPM2) (Fig. 2A,B). Freshly isolated primary MM cells
(n = 11) kept in co-culture with bone marrow stromal cells and
exposed to TPCA-1 [20 mM] for 3 days showed cell death
induction (annexin V positivity) to quite variable extent, with a
median survival of 61% relative to DMSO-treated controls
(Fig. 2C). Of note, Bay 11-7082 [30 mM] induced complete cell
death (,10% of control) in all cell lines as well as in the large
majority of primary MM samples (Fig. 2A,B,C). A refined analysis
of cell death induction with 30 mM Bay 11-7082 in KMS-12-BM
and MM.1S MM cells revealed very rapid kinetics. Reduced
viability was already detectable after 1 h and the complete effect
was typically reached within 2–4 h (Fig. 2D).
Cell Death Induction by Bay 11-7082 Involves Necrosis￾related Mechanisms
Treatment of MM cells with Bay 11-7082 induced rapid
swelling and subsequent desintegration of the cellular body, which
are typical signs of necrosis (Fig. 3A). Necrosis-related forms of cell
death often involve generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
and engage the kinase receptor interacting protein-1 (RIP1) [11].
To evaluate whether these molecules also play a role in Bay 11-
7082-induced cell death, we used the antioxidant butylhydrox￾yanisole (BHA) and necrostatin-1, which inhibits the kinase
activity of RIP1 [12]. Both compounds were initially able to
block the detrimental effects of 30 mM Bay 11-7082 in KMS-12-
BM cells (Fig. 3B–D) but were still unable to rescue the cells for
extended periods of time (Fig. 3D). However, BHA was ineffective
from the outset in MM.1S cells (Fig. 3B–D). The failure of
necrostatin-1 to rescue MM cells after prolonged incubation with
Bay 11-7082 was not due to concomitant activation of caspases,
because virtually no activation of caspases was observed in cells
challenged with Bay 11-7082 (data not shown) and the pan￾caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk did not improve the protective effect
of necrostatin-1 (Fig. 3C,D).
The NAE-inhibitor MLN4924 Efficiently Inhibits Cytokine￾induced Activation of the Classical and Alternative NFkB
Pathways Downstream of IKKs but is Less Cytotoxic than
Bay 11-7082
The much stronger cytotoxic effect of Bay 11-7082 compared
to the IKK2-specific inhibitor TPCA-1 could indicate that
NFkBs regulated by the alternative NFkB pathway are the most
crucial ones for MM cell survival but could also be a
consequence of either NFkB-independent functions of IKK1
or of off-target effects. We therefore chose an alternative
approach to analyze the cytotoxic effects of inhibition of the
classical and alternative pathways at a level downstream of
IKK1 and IKK2. For this purpose, we used the NEDD8
activating enzyme (NAE)-inhibitor MLN4924 [13]. Degradation
of IkBa in response to its phosphorylation by IKK2, as well as
p100 processing in response to its phosphorylation by IKK1
require a bTrCP-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase complex of the
SCF (SKP 1 – cullin 1 – F-box protein) family [14,15].
Modification of the Cul-1 component of the SCFbTrCP complex
with NEDD8 in turn is required for both ubiquitination of IkBa
and p100 processing [1,14,15]. Accordingly, MLN4924 inhib￾ited TNF-induced degradation of IkBa and IL8 production
without blocking IkBa phosphorylation (Fig. 4A,B). Likewise,
treatment with MLN4924 strongly reduced TWEAK-induced
p100 processing and led to NIK accumulation (Fig. 4C). At
concentrations where the inhibitory effect of MLN4924 on
NFkB signaling was comparable or even stronger than those of
Bay 11-7082, this compound was substantially less toxic on MM
cells from either cell lines or primary origin (Fig. 4D,E). Thus,
the cytotoxic effects of Bay 11-7082 in MM cells are not related
to inhibition of NFkBs and must therefore be caused by
interference with NFkB-independent functions of IKK1 or by
off-target effects. Indeed, there is also evidence for NFkB￾unrelated cell death induction by Bay 11-7082 from studies with
Ewing’s sarcoma tumor cell lines and precursor-B acute
lymphoblastic leukaemia cell lines and blasts [16,17]. Moreover,
a recent study by Lee et al. shows that Bay 11-7082 functions as
an inhibitor of multiple proinflammatory signaling pathways
resulting in the activation of AP-1, STAT-1 and IRF-3 [18].
However, given the drug’s strong propensity to initiate cell
necrosis it remains possible that some of the anti-inflammatory
effects described in this report represent secondary consequenc￾es of cell disintegration rather than a direct inhibitory effect of
Bay 11-7082. Of note, although TPCA-1 as well as MLN4924
did show dose-dependent impairment of MM cell viability and
induction of MM cell death, at concentrations sufficient to block
either the classical (TPCA-1, 20 mM) or the classical and
alternative pathways (MLN4924, 10 mM) these compounds did
not differ substantially in their capacity to elicit the respective
effects. If anything, the neddylation inhibitor appeared even
somewhat less toxic than TPCA-1 in short-term (18 h) in vitro
treatments of MM cells (Fig. 2B vs. 4D), whereas their effects on
the survival of primary MM cells co-cultured with BMSCs and
exposed to either 20 mM TPCA-1 or 10 mM MLN4924 for 3
days were broadly similar (Fig. 2C vs. 4E). This result did not
suggest that the concomitant inhibition of both NFkB pathways
was superior in its anti-myeloma efficacy to using the IKK2
inhibitor alone.
Knockdown of IKKs did not Adversely Affect MM Cell
Growth and Survival in Shorter Time Frames
In order to probe the effects of NFkB pathway abrogation by
other than pharmacological means we also used siRNAs against
the IKKs in order to attenuate intrinsic activities of the NFkB
performed. Groups showing significant inhibition (p-values#0.01) of TNF-induced IL8 production are indicated by asterisks. (C) HT29 cells were
pretreated for 1 h with the indicated concentrations of MLN4924 and then stimulated with Flag-TWEAK (200 ng/ml) for 18 h. The levels of p52, p100
and NIK were analyzed by Western blotting of total cell lysates. (D) MM cell lines were treated for 18 h with 10 mM MLN4924 and assayed for viability
using the MTT assay. Significant (unpaired, two-tailed t-test, p-values#0.01) induction of cell death is highlighted by asterisks. (E) Primary MM
samples (n = 11) in co-culture with BMSCs were treated with 10 mM MLN4924 for 3 days and cell death was assessed by annexin V-FITC/PI staining

IKK Inhibitor-Induced NFkB-Independent Cell Death

pathways in MM cell lines JJN3, L363 and MM.1S. Cells were
electroporated with stealth siRNA against either IKK1 (stIKK1)
or IKK2 (stIKK2), or with a mixture of both. A non-specific
siRNA duplex (scram) served as transfection control. Addition￾ally, expression plasmids for EGFP (to monitor transfection
efficiency) and CD4D (to permit purification and further culture
of only the strongly transfected cells [9]) were co-transfected. At
concentrations of 2.5 mM in the electroporation mix the siRNAs
led to profound depletion of IKK1 and/or IKK2 (exemplarily
shown at day 2 post-transfection for L363 cells; Fig. 5A) lasting
for at least 5 days (not shown). However, neither general viability,
as determined by the alamarBlue metabolic colorimetric assay,
nor explicit cell survival, as determined by staining with annexin
V-FITC and propidium iodide followed by flow cytometric
analysis, were substantially impaired in any of these cell lines (an
exemplary measurement of the purified transfected cells at day 4
post-transfection for both of these assays is shown for L363 cells
in Fig. 5B). MM cells with single knockdown of either IKK1 or
IKK2 showed very little digression from the values for the control
transfections (measured at days 3, 4 and 5 post-transfection;
Fig. 5B and data not shown), and even though the double
knockdown of IKK1 and IKK2 tended to entail slightly lower
values for viability/survival in some experiments, on average less
than 10% decline from control values was noted (Fig. 5C for
experimental values at day 4 post-transfection, and data not
shown).
Even though the amount of NFkB activity in MM cells does
not generally appear to exceed levels normally seen in plasma
cells [19], the presence of genetic lesions conducive to the
generation or increase of cell autonomous activation of the
NFkB system in a significant number of MM samples strongly
implies a functional role in the molecular aetiology of this
disease [19–22]. A number of IKK2 inhibitors have been
found toxic to MM cells (e.g. [23–27]) although the described
effects vary considerably, and it has recently been suggested
that dual inhibition of the alternative and classical pathways is
required to elicit MM cell death, as shown with the Rel protein
inhibitor PBS-1086 [28]. We observed a striking discordance
in the anti-MM effects of the different pharmacological NFkB￾pathway inhibitors tested, but also vis-a`-vis IKK1 and 2
depletion by siRNA-mediated knockdown. Whereas in the case
of Bay 11-7082 its high anti-MM toxicity is mostly attributable
to necrosis induction, it remains surprising that the reasonably
extensive IKK double knockdown failed to even mildly
emulate the more moderate toxicity seen with either TPCA-1
or the neddylation inhibitor MLN4924, especially as the MM
cell lines used are known to harbor mutations that activate the
NFkB system [19,20]. Whether and in which genetic
background blockade of the NFkB system is a suitable
therapeutic option to induce MM cell apoptosis (as opposed
to growth inhibition relying on long-term systemic drug
treatment) thus remains an open question. A more detailed
study in MM cells addressing the consequences of molecular
ablation of the actual transcription factors themselves should
provide further clues towards an answer.
