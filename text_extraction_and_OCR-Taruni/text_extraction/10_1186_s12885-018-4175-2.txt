Abstract
Background: After orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), recurrent HCC mostly
develops within 2 years. All cases of de novo HCC described so far occurred later than 2 years after OLT. Prevention
of post-transplantation HCC has usually been tried to achieve by curing or controlling recurrent liver disease. This
has been rationale for treatment with interferon (IFN)/ribavirin of HCV-recurrence in patients after OLT, transplanted
for advanced HCV-induced liver disease and/or HCC. The availability of new and more efficient drugs has improved
chances also for previously difficult-to-treat HCV-positive patients.
Case presentation: A 75 year-old male patient who had undergone OLT for decompensated HCV-cirrhosis in 2009,
and bilio-digestive surgery in 2011 under tracrolimus (0.5 mg/day) and prednisone (5 mg/day) immunosuppressive
therapy, started to receive antiviral treatment for recurrent HCV-infection of graft with 200 mg/day ribavirin in
combination with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir by the end of October 2015. Because of multiple side effects (anemia,
asthenia, infections, and reduction of kidney functions - palliated by treatment with erythropoietin), treatment was
stopped after 16 weeks. At the third control, a minimal increase in alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) serum level to 10 μg/L was
measured 8 months after therapy, whereas both liver sonography and serum transaminases were normal. The patient’s
general condition; however, remained poor, and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of abdomen was performed 2
months later. A nodule of 3 cm in diameter with a pseudocapsule was found centrally in the liver. The patient had to
be hospitalized for recurrent infections of the lung, overt ascites and peritonitis. Rapid tumor growth (10 cm) was
detected during last stay in hospital (April 2017), concomitant with a rise of AFP-serum levels to 91 μg/L. The family
decided to take the patient home, and best supportive care was provided by a general practitioner, local nurses and
the patient’s dedicated wife until his death.
Conclusion: Before treating OLT patients with HCV graft reinfection one should not only consider possible advantages
of newly effective antiviral-therapies, but also life expectancy and possible side effects (difficult to manage at an
outpatient service basis), including severe disadvantages such as the development of HCC.

Background
Worldwide, approximately 180 million people are
infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) [1]. Twenty
to 30% of the infected people will develop liver
cirrhosis, and among these, appr. 5% are in danger to
develop liver cancer [2]. In the IFN era, about 50% of
the patients infected with HCV genotype 1 (G1)
achieved sustained virological response (SVR) [3].
HCV-infection is considered to be a major cause of
liver cancer development [4], and infections may still
develop in cirrhotic patients even after HCV￾eradication [5]. Recently, an interesting French
nationwide report pointed out that only 8% of the
reported liver tumor cases were specifically due to
HCV-infection [6]. This could be an explanation for
the fact that, statistically, HCV-eradication may not
guarantee longer life expectancy compared to persons
not having received HCV-eradication [7]. HCV￾induced liver cirrhosis and liver cancer are the key
indicators for liver transplantation [8]. Chronic hepatitis
and cirrhosis may quickly develop after reinfection of the
graft in HCV-patients receiving orthotopic liver
transplantation (OLT) for HCV-positive advanced liver
cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [9, 10]. In
transplant centers, HCV-eradication therapy has been
performed before and/or after transplantation, and
successful viral elimination has been reported under
combination of Peg-IFN and ribavirin, administered for
different periods [11, 12]. Sustained virological response
after both OLT and kidney transplantation has been
shown to improve the overall survival in patients with
HCV-infection [13–18].
Nowadays, anti HCV-therapies have been successively
replaced by IFN-free direct-acting-antiviral (DAA)
agents with or without ribavirin, leading to a reduction
of therapy duration (12–24 weeks), and to an improve￾ment of viral elimination rates to almost 100% for all
difficulty grades and viral genotypes [19, 20]. In 2015,
the combination of ladispovir / sofusbovir and ribavirin
for 24 weeks in patients with HCV-reinfection after OLT
was considered gold-standard, with therapy beginning at
any time after transplantation [20].
Recurrence of HCC has been observed in a number
of cases, even after successful elimination of HCV
before or after OLT [21–24]. De novo HCC￾development after OLT, however, is a very rare event,
and only a few cases have been described so far [25]. A
few reports demonstrated an increase of HCC develop￾ment or recurrence in patients with liver cirrhosis due
to HCV-infection and SVR after IFN-free treatment
[26, 27] outside the transplantation setting. In contrast,
de novo HCC development after having achieved SVR
in patients transplanted for HCV-cirrhosis has not yet
been described [25].
Case presentation
In July 2009, a 69-year-old male patient with decompen￾sated HCV-cirrhosis underwent OLT. Postoperative time
was complicated by bile duct anastomosis leakage, which
was then treated with surgical bilio-digestive anasto￾mosis in 2011. In 2012, liver histology showed bridging
fibrosis, but no clear signs of cirrhosis. During the
following years, a mild subclinical cholestasis was treated
with oral deoxycholic acid. Immunosuppression was
performed with tacrolimus (0.5 mg/day) and prednisone
(5 mg/day). Despite viral reinfection and repeated
episodes of cholangitis with pruritus, successfully treated
with antibiotics, graft function was preserved with
acceptable quality of life. As electrography on the graft
reached 25 kPa, therapy with ledipasvir (90 mg) /
sofusbovir (400 mg) combined with a reduced dosage of
ribavirin (200 mg) was started by the end of October
2015. While HCV-negativity was found after 4 weeks of
therapy, severe asthenia, loss of appetite and repeated
infections developed together with progressive anemia.
The latter persisted in spite of weekly subcutaneous
administration of erythropoietin. Subsequently, reduc￾tion of kidney glomerular filtration rate developed. For
this reason, therapy was stopped after 16 weeks while
the patient developed ascites and edema of the legs in
spite of improvement of liver stiffness down to 15 kPa.
After two episodes of pneumonia and repeated labora￾tory and sonography surveillance (performed by experi￾enced radiologists), 8 months after the end of treatment
a first mild increase of serum AFP was detected, while
ultrasonography (Fig. 1) did not detect any nodules in
the liver. Two months later, a nodule of 3 cm size was
detected by multiphasic-MRI (performed with adminis￾tration of Gd-BOPTA) in the center of the left hepatic
lobe (segment 2 (S2)), and a second smaller (1.5 cm)
nodule in S4. The hyperintensity of the main lesion on
T1-weighted images with enhancement in the arterial
phase and with delayed portal venous wash-out [28] was
Fig. 1 Liver ultrasound examination performed 10 months after the
end of treatment when AFP was 10 ng/ml. No signs of liver cirrhosis
and no signs of tumor were detectable

judged to be suspicious for HCC according to the guide￾lines of the European Society for Medical Oncology
(ESMO) (Figs. 2, 3 and 4). The multitude of the lesions
led to the decision of therapeutic non-intervention, and
best supportive care was offered to the patient in a
tertiary care hospital.
General physical conditions continuously worsened.
An MRI of the liver performed by the end of April
2017 (Figs. 5 and 6) showed a massive increase in size
of the former central nodule to 10 cm, completely
occupying the left liver lobe, accompanied by an
increase of serum AFP levels to 91 ng/ ml (Table 1).
The family decided to take the patient home where he
was having palliative care from his dedicated wife, from
his home doctor and nurse.
Discussion
HCV-infection alone or in combination with other
damaging noxae such as alcoholic beverages or xenobi￾otics can lead to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and liver
cancer (HCC). Risk of tumor development has been
shown to be significantly reduced in patients who
achieved sustained virological response (SVR) after
antiviral therapy consisting of IFN-alpha and ribavirin.
Long-term follow-up studies will reveal whether this is
the case also for the highly effective new IFN-free
therapies with directly-acting-antiviral (DAA) drugs with
or without ribavirin [5, 29–32].
Decompensated liver cirrhosis and liver cancer still
remain the principal indications for liver transplantation.
Recurrence of HCV-infection in the graft, however, is a
common adverse event immediately after liver
transplantation. Reinfection and the concomitant admin￾istration of various drugs leads to the development of
liver cirrhosis in about 20 to 30% of the transplanted
patients within 5 years after transplantation, with
reduction of overall survival compared to alcoholic liver
disease [10]. The introduction of new drugs has ignited
the discussion about the timing when therapy should be
administered, namely before or after transplantation,
and, if after transplantation, at which time point exactly?
Some reports have initiated a debate about the possi￾bility of an increased frequency of liver cancer, which
may be seen within months after the end of treatment in
patients with SVR, who were previously operated for
HCC-resection [26]. An increased incidence of HCC has
also been reported in patients with liver cirrhosis after
SVR achieved with IFN-free therapy [27]. This danger
seems to be higher in older patients with more advanced
cirrhosis [33–42]. Recurrence of liver tumor after OLT
for HCC (mostly outside the liver) is a well-known

was detected in the left liver lobe (arrow), while a further small nodule
was suspected (smaller arrow). No signs of cirrhosis were detectable

complication, and the advantages of antiviral therapy
during the patient’s stay on the waiting list [26, 43] or
after OLT has not yet been proven.
Although we cannot exclude the possibility of the
presence of tumor cells in liver at the beginning of
DAA-therapy, this is the first case report on de novo
liver cancer shortly after DAA-induced HCV￾elimination in a patient who received long-term
treatment after OLT. It is not yet clear how anti￾viral treatment could be responsible for tumor
development and/or acceleration of tumor growth.
One possibility is that prolonged immunosuppression
may be aggravated by antiviral agents (including
ribavirin), thereby supporting the growth of scattered
tumor cells, which have escaped immunosurveillance
and were already present at the start of antiviral
therapy.
Development of de novo HCC in patients transplanted
for advanced liver cirrhosis without clinical signs of
cancer is a very rare event. In fact, it has been thought
that successful antiviral therapy and alcohol abstinence
should prevent cirrhosis and carcinogenesis in the graft,
and patients may rather die for other medical complica￾tions before the occurrence of cirrhosis and cancer.
Indeed, the early appearance of HCC in the graft after
transplantation may represent the recurrence of a pre￾existing tumor in the explanted liver, which was not
detectable at the time of transplantation. This can only
be proven through molecular analyses of the tumor
material, which would allow the identification of donor
or recipient origin. De novo HCC has also been reported
in patients with HCV-reinfection, who achieved SVR
after antiviral therapy with IFN and ribavirin [44].
Recurrence of cirrhosis has been confirmed to be a risk
factor for de novo HCC-development in the re-infected
graft, as is true for patients with HCV-positive liver
diseases before transplantation. In one reported case, a
tumor developed in a 59-year-old female patient
transplanted for HCV-positive HCC, 6 years after living￾donor liver transplantation and 2 years after signs of
decompensated liver cirrhosis. She was successfully
treated with antiviral therapy (Peg-IFN and ribavirin) for
48 weeks [44]. A CT-scan of the liver detected a hepatic
nodule of 1 cm size, which was radiologically diagnosed
as a classical HCC. The patient had higher AFP-serum
levels during 6 months after CT-scan. Liver function
tests were, however, within the normal range. Tumor
resection was performed, and a tumor of 0.9 cm in size
with trabecular growth and desmoplastic changes was

diagnosed histologically. The non-tumorous liver tissue
was cirrhotic with inflammatory infiltrates of the fibrotic
septa. Genotyping of DNA samples extracted from the
tumorous and non-tumorous tissue from the graft and
the donor indicated that it was a de novo HCC,
diagnosed 2 years after end of treatment, and about
2.5 years after confirmation of negative serum HCV￾RNA level under antiviral treatment. Our patient
developed detectable tumors and a minor increase in
serum-AFP level 12 months after start of DAA-therapy
and 8 months after the end of therapy. HCC was
diagnosed based on the MRI-finding of liver tumor(s),
and elevated AFP-serum level. However, in consideration
of the reduced physical conditions and of the rather
decreasing liver function parameters, in spite of normal
transaminase serum levels, no further local or systemic
anti-tumoral therapeutic measures were taken into
consideration while a rapid and massive growth of the
main tumor was detectable 4 months later.
At this time, patient had to be hospitalized for ascites
edema of the legs, attacks of abdominal pain and fever.
Recurrent bacterial peritonitis was treated with
antibiotics. When diagnosis of a growing tumor was
confirmed by MRI, he was sent home for best supportive
care by his dedicated wife, home doctor and nurse until
his death (June 12th, 2017).
Conclusions
Decision of treating patients suffering of HCV-infection
after liver transplantation with DAA-drugs should take
in consideration possible side effects including cancer
development and life expectancy.
