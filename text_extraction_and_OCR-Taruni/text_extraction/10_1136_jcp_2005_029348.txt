Abstract
Aims: The characteristic histological feature of autoimmune
hepatitis (AIH) is interface hepatitis with predominant portal
lymphoplasmacytic necroinflammatory infiltration. Centrilobular
necrosis (CN), reminiscent of toxic or circulatory liver injury, has
been reported in AIH. The aim of this study was to assess the
frequency of CN in patients with AIH and its correlation with
laboratory and clinical data.
Methods: Liver biopsies were obtained from 114 patients (90
women, 24 men, mean (SD) age 45.4 (19.4) years) with AIH and
were evaluated under code by a single pathologist according to the
modified Knodell score.
Results: CN was found in 20 (17.5%) patients with virtually
unaffected portal areas in four cases. Patients with AIH with CN had
a higher total hepatic activity index (median (range) 11 (6 to 15) v
5 (2 to 10)) and presented less frequently with cirrhosis (10% v
38%). Patients with CN had a higher frequency of acute onset (87%
v 32%), higher bilirubin (median (range) 12.0 (0.43 to 40.0) v 1.9
(0.36 to 46)) and higher ALT levels (median (range) 25.6 (2.7 to
63.9) v 7.2 (0.7 to 62.6)), than did patients with AIH without
centrizonal injury.
Conclusion: CN with sparing of the portal areas represents a rare
histological pattern in AIH. CN is associated with an acute clinical
presentation and might reflect an early lesion preceding portal
involvement. Recognition of this particular histological appearance
enables early diagnosis of AIH and a timely initiation of
immunosuppressive therapy.
