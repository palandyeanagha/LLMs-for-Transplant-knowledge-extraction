Abstract. Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a 
primary benign disease, which is characterized by papilloma￾tous growth in the respiratory tract. Malignant transformation 
occurs in only 3‑5% of cases, however, local growth of the 
benign papillomas is interpreted as clinically malignant in 
a markedly higher proportion of patients. Local surgical or 
endoscopic interventional debulking or excision is currently 
the commonly selected treatment method and antiviral therapy 
is a potential adjuvant approach. However, the long‑term 
management of RRP patients, who commonly require multiple 
procedures over numerous years, is challenging and the 
overall therapeutic armamentarium remains unsatisfactory. 
The administration of systemic bevacizumab treatment in a 
series of five patients with long histories of RRP, who required 
repeated local interventions to control papilloma growth is 
evaluated. Treatment with the anti‑vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF) antibody bevacizumab was administered at 
a dose of 5 mg/kg (n=1), 10 mg/kg (n=3) or 15 mg/kg (n=1) 
intravenously to the five RRP patients, who were clinically 
classified as exhibiting progressive disease. Endoscopic 
evaluations were performed prior to the first infusion of beva￾cizumab and intermittently at variable time points during the 
course of therapy. Histopathological analyses were performed 
using pre‑ and post‑treatment papilloma biopsies, including 
immunohistochemical analyses of VEGF and phosphorylated 
VEGF receptor (VEGFR)‑2 expression. The patients received 
between three and 16 courses of bevacizumab (median, 
six courses). The first course was initiated when progression 
following the previous intervention was observed. An imme￾diate response to bevacizumab treatment was demonstrated 
in all five RRP patients. While the cumulative number of 
interventions in the five patients was 18 throughout the 
12 months prior to the initiation of bevacizumab treatment, 
only one patient required interventional treatment due to a 
malignant transformation during the 12 months following 
treatment with bevacizumab (18 vs. 1 interventions, P=0.042). 
Histopathological analyses revealed regressive perivascular 
edema and normalization of the vascular structure, however, 
immunohistochemical analyses of the VEGF and phosphory￾lated VEGFR‑2 expression did not demonstrate any changes 
following therapy. Due to the limited number of alternative 
treatments, VEGF‑targeted therapies may represent a prom￾ising novel strategy in the treatment of RRP, which may have 
the potential to modify the current treatment standards, partic￾ularly in patients with poorly accessible papilloma lesions, 
however, this requires further investigation in clinical trials.
Introduction
Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a potentially 
devastating, incurable disease that is caused by infection with 
the human papilloma virus (HPV), predominantly HPV‑6 and 
‑11. Primary benign tumorous manifestations of RRP occur 
throughout the respiratory tract and may lead to laryngeal, 
tracheal or bronchial obstructions, and pulmonary nodes and 
cystic lesions due to valve effects (1). The incidence of RRP 
in the USA is 4.3/100,000 children and 1.8/100,000 adults (2). 
Furthermore, malignant transformation occurs in 3‑5% of 
RRP cases (3). When RRP progresses into the pulmonary 
parenchyma, there are no effective therapeutic strategies and 
it is almost invariably fatal (3,4). Current standard manage￾ment of RRP involves repeated local surgical debulking by

laser therapy, which is associated with a significant risk of 
chronic morbidity, including voice mutilation. In total >10,000 
interventional treatment procedures for RRP are performed 
each year in the USA; patients undergo a mean average of 
4.4 procedures per year and 19.7 overall (2). The data regarding 
adjuvant antiviral therapy, particularly intralesional cidofovir, 
remain inconsistent (5).
A strong mRNA expression of VEGF‑A and its receptors, 
VEGFR‑1 and ‑2 has been observed in tissue samples of RRP 
patients (6). In 2009, Nagel et al (7) reported a case of systemic 
adjuvant therapy using the anti‑VEGF antibody, bevacizumab. 
In this case, bevacizumab appeared to delay the requirement 
for further local interventions. In addition, a previous study 
was conducted, which demonstrated a series of adults exhib￾iting papillomatosis who were treated with combined laser 
therapy and sublesionally injected bevacizumab (8); a second 
study was recently conducted in a population of children (9).
The clinical courses of five patients with long histories of 
RRP in whom the systemic administrations of bevacizumab 
were evaluated are reported. 
Patients and methods
Patient characteristics. Between April 2011 and May 2012 
five patients aged 8‑56 years (median, 43 years) presented at 
the Department of Medicine (University Hospital, Muenster, 
Germany) with histories of RRP ranging between 6 months 
and 37 years (median, 3 years). The patient characteristics are 
presented in Table I. The manifestations of RRP were as follows: 
Lung parenchyma, n=2; tracheobronchial involvement, n=2; 
the larynx and vocal cords, n=3; and sinonasal inverted papil￾loma, n=1. All of the patients had previously received multiple 
local interventions (from three to >30) predominantly by laser 
therapy. One patient suffering from papilloma involvement of 
the paranasal sinuses had received a radical surgery by midfa￾cial degloving and adjuvant radiotherapy. One patient, who 
was exhibiting lung parenchymal involvement, had received a 
middle lobe resection and demonstrated evidence of malignant 
transformation of a papilloma manifestation. In addition, the 
administration of additional adjuvant medical therapeutic 
agents, such as cidofovir, celecoxib and interferon had been 
tried in two patients. However, all five patients presented with 
progressive disease at the time of treatment initiation with 
systemic bevacizumab therapy. The report is in accordance 
with the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines.
Treatment and response evaluation. Written informed consent 
was obtained from each patient. Bevacizumab administration was 
initiated at a dose of between 5 and 15 mg/kg intravenously every 
2‑3 weeks. Treatment intervals were subsequently extended after 
achieving the maximum response as demonstrated by endos￾copy and/or bronchoscopy. Endoscopy was performed prior to 
and between days three and seven following treatment initiation. 
Follow‑up endoscopies were performed prior to every subsequent 
course of bevacizumab. Digital endoscopic imaging documenta￾tion was conducted using a routine documentation systems (BF 
Q180 video‑bronchoscope; CV‑160 video‑processor; Olympus 
Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Computed tomography (CT) was 
performed in two patients to follow up the RRP involvement of 
the lung parenchyma or paranasal sinuses.
Histopathological analyses. Papilloma tissue samples 
were obtained for standard histological and immunohisto￾logical analyses prior to and following the first infusion of 
bevacizumab in two patients. For immunohistochemistry, 
formalin‑fixed and paraffin‑embedded tissues were analyzed 
using primary polyclonal rabbit anti‑human antibodies 
specific to VEGF (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA; 
working dilution, 1:50), phosphorylated VEGFR‑2 (Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology; working dilution, 1:50) and the alkaline phos￾phatase anti‑alkaline phosphatase double‑bridge technique 
(DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark). Briefly, tissue sections 
were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in a graded 
ethanol series. Following antigen retrieval in a microwave oven 
at 450 W (twice for 7 min in 10 mM sodium citrate [pH 6.0; 
DakoCytomation]) the primary antibodies were applied to 
the tissue sections overnight at 4˚C. Subsequent steps were 
performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The 
Fast‑Red substrate (DakoCytomation) was used for detection 
of phosphatase activity and sections were counterstained with 
hematoxylin and eosin (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany).
DNA fragmentation assay. To investigate apoptosis in the 
histology specimen, the In Situ Cell Death Detection kit, 
AP (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) was used, which is based on 
the Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end 
labeling (TUNEL)-reaction. TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells 
were counted in three representative independent microscopic 
fields (magnification, 200x) per tumor (Axioskope, Zeiss, 
Oberkochen, Germany).
Statistical analysis. For statistical analysis the Wilcoxon 
signed-rank test was used. P‑values were two-sided and P<0.05 
was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
Results
Patient 1. This patient was a 43‑year‑old male, who had been 
diagnosed with HPV‑11‑associated respiratory papillomatosis 
at the age of 6 years. Between the ages of 8 and 13 years, 
multiple interventions, including a temporary tracheostomy, 
had been necessary and were followed by a stable disease 
phase for ~20 years. Since 1997, the disease had begun to 
progress and required repeated interventions. In April 2011, 
multiple tracheal papilloma manifestations led to a tracheal 
stenosis of upto 70%. CT scans revealed numerous pulmonary 
nodes, cystic lesions and a tumor measuring 2.5x2.6 cm in the 
middle lobe. Tracheal laser therapy temporarily resulted in 
good short‑term results and resection of the middle lobe with 
lymphadenectomy led to the diagnosis of a papilloma with 
transformation to squamous cell carcinoma (T1bN0M0, TNM 
Classification for Malignant Tumors) (10).
Four weeks later, a follow‑up bronchoscopy demonstrated 
progression of the tracheal papillomatosis and clinical stridor 
was detected (Fig. 1). At that time, systemic treatment with 
bevacizumab was initiated at a dose of 10 mg/kg. Three 
days after treatment initiation a bronchoscopy indicated a 
significant response, with a reduction of ~50% of the tracheal 
manifestations and the stridor had disappeared completely. 
After 21 days, certain papillomas were no longer present, 
and the dyspnea and hoarseness had improved markedly, 

1914 ONCOLOGY LETTERS 8: 1912-1918, 2014
prompting the continuation of the bevacizumab therapy. Due 
to the activity and good tolerability of bevacizumab, it was 
decided that the patient could be treated at 14‑day intervals. 
Following eight cycles of treatment (day 139) a bronchoscopy 
demonstrated only minimal residual disease (Fig. 1). The very 
good partial remission (VGPR), which was also observed 
in the chest CT‑scans (Fig. 2), showed ongoing stability for 
27 months at the time of writing. The patient is well and has 
resumed normal daily activities. The only treatment‑associ￾ated side‑effect was mild hypertension, which was managed 
with a calcium antagonist. Treatment intervals were extended 
to 4 months, and no surgical interventions were necessary 
subsequent to treatment initiation with bevacizumab.
Patient 2. This 49‑year‑old male was diagnosed with severe 
laryngeal RRP in January 2011. At the initial diagnosis 
local papilloma debulking was achieved using laser therapy. 
However, 6 months later, the papillomatosis relapsed and 
required a second laser‑based intervention. The disease 
progressed again and bevacizumab treatment was initiated 
(dose, 10 mg/kg). An endoscopy prior to treatment revealed 
exophytic papilloma growth in the right supraglottic area 
(Fig. 3A). Pathological examination of biopsies taken from the 
area excluded the presence of squamous cell carcinoma. An 
endoscopy on day four after the first administration of bevaci￾zumab demonstrated a rapid response in the patient. A second 
control endoscopy, which was performed immediately prior to 
the application of the second cycle of bevacizumab on day 20, 
showed further regression of the papilloma mass (Fig. 3A). 
In parallel, hoarseness improved significantly within a few 
days and the patient did not experience treatment‑associated 
side‑effects. However, in this case, clinical worsening led to 
a re‑evaluation, including a CT scan prior to the third cycle 
of bevacizumab, revealing destructive tumor growth that 
was potentially malignant transformation in the subglottic 
area, while the supraglottic RRP manifestation demonstrated 
a sustained VGPR. A laryngectomy was performed and 
histology identified the co‑existence of squamous cell carci￾noma and papilloma lesions. At present, the patient has not yet 
demonstrated a relapse of RRP.
Patient 3. This patient was a 56‑year‑old female, who was 
diagnosed with laryngeal and glottal RRP in 2009. Clinical 
symptoms predominantly included hoarseness, an irritative 
cough and dyspnea. Throughout the subsequent 3 years a total 
of 16 laser ablation therapies were necessary at increasingly

observed (second column) and a very good partial remission with only minimal papilloma residues was documented under continuous bevacizumab treatment

shorter intervals, with the final interventions only leading 
to a short‑term improvement of the symptoms. Systemic 
therapy with bevacizumab was initiated in March 2012. An 
endoscopy seven days after the first dose of bevacizumab 
(10 mg/kg) revealed a partial response (PR) of the supraglottic 
papilloma, while the manifestation on the right vocal cord 
remained stable. After the second cycle, a further reduction of 
the supraglottic lesion was observed. Clinically, the patient's 
voice became increasingly powerful and dyspnea on exer￾tion significantly improved shortly after treatment initiation. 
Bevacizumab therapy was paused following four cycles and 
the patient's clinical condition remained stable for >9 months 
(Fig. 3B). After this period the patient developed symptoms 
of recurrence with an endoscopy indicating recurrence of 
papilloma growth. Bevacizumab therapy was resumed and 
resulted in clinical improvement within five days. Again, an 
endoscopy on day 14 demonstrated the complete resolution of 
the supraglottic papilloma. One infraglottic lesion, which had 
not responded to the same extent was treated with additional 
laser therapy and a diagnosis of malignant transformation 
was excluded.
Patient 4. A 2‑year‑old female, who was diagnosed in 
2007 with HPV‑11‑associated RRP involving the larynx, 
trachea, deeper bronchi, and the lung parenchyma required 
a tracheostomy in August 2008 and multiple laser ablation 
therapies until January 2012. Adjuvant treatment attempts 
with interferon‑alpha, cidofovir and celecoxib did not result 
in disease control. In January 2012 laser therapy of the large 
tracheal RRP manifestations was performed. Fig. 3C shows 
the papilloma lesions in the right main bronchus, which 
were not locally treated at that time. Two life‑threatening 
airway complications occurred during an elective change of 
the tracheal cannula and in the context of a tracheal laser 
intervention. To avoid re‑growth of the papillomas in the 
trachea and disease progression in the right main bronchus 
the decision to initiate bevacizumab treatment (5 mg/kg 
every 2 weeks) was made following the laser treatment. After 
four cycles of bevacizumab no further papilloma growth was 
observed in the trachea and bronchi, and the treatment was 
paused (Fig. 3C). Monthly bronchoscopic assessments did 
not indicate recurrent disease activity for 6 months. Five 
months after bevacizumab discontinuation, an endoscopy 
showed multilocular papilloma relapse in the trachea and 
bronchi, and a fifth cycle of bevacizumab was administered. 
On day two after administration, a notable response was 
observed and no further local interventions for papilloma￾tosis were necessary for more than one year of treatment at 
three‑monthly intervals. One solitary manifestation at the 
distal end of the tracheal cannula was clinically classified 
as a granuloma and had to be laser abraded (histologically 
confirmed as papilloma) in May 2013.

Patient 5. A 32‑year‑old male was diagnosed with nasopharyn￾geal papillomatosis and paranasal sinus papilloma in 2010. Over 
24 months several interventions, including laser vaporization 
and radical surgery via midfacial degloving had been necessary. 
In February 2012 an attempt to treat the sinonasal inverted 
papilloma with radiotherapy was made. However, three months 
later additional laser therapy was required and was complicated 
by chronic bleeding from the nasopharynx, which led to severe 
anemia (hemoglobin, 5.5 g/dl). A CT scan performed in July 
2012 showed inverted papilloma in all of the paranasal sinuses, 
including a complete obstructed right frontal sinus, a subtotal 
obstruction of the left frontal sinus and a complete obstruction 
of the left maxillary sinus. An endoscopy revealed recurrent 
papilloma growth at the velum (Fig. 3D) while the possibility 
of deeper tracheobronchial manifestations could be excluded. It 
was decided that this patient could be treated with bevacizumab 
at a dose of 15 mg/kg every three weeks. An endoscopy on 
day four following treatment initiation indicated an immediate 
response of the papilloma manifestations that were located at 
the velum; furthermore, a partial remission with a 50% reduc￾tion was observed on day 20 (Fig. 3D). A CT scan after three
cycles of bevacizumab also revealed a response in the left frontal 
sinus and the left maxillary sinus, while the right frontal sinus 
continued to be obstructed (Fig. 2B). The patient experienced 
no treatment‑associated complications. After the third cycle no 
further regression of the papilloma manifestations at the velum 
occurred and the treatment was paused. Two months later, a 
routine endoscopy showed papilloma progression again and a

fourth cycle of bevacizumab was administered, which resulted 
in immediate papilloma regression.
Histopathological analyses. Histopathological analyses of 
pre‑ and post‑therapeutic papilloma biopsies showed regressive 
edema and normalization of the vascular structures (Fig. 4). 
However, immunohistochemical analyses of the VEGF and 
phosphorylated VEGFR‑2 expression did not show any changes 
following therapy with bevacizumab (data not shown).
Summary of clinical efficacy. The clinical efficacy of 
systemic bevacizumab treatment is summarized in Table II. 
Bevacizumab induced PR or VGPR of papilloma manifesta￾tions in 5/5 patients. When comparing the cumulative number 
of local interventions during the 12‑month period prior to 
bevacizumab treatment initiation with the 12 month period 
following bevacizumab treatment, the number of interven￾tions was reduced from 18 to one (P=0.042, Wilcoxon 
signed‑rank test).
Discussion
The induction of papilloma regression is presented in five 
consecutive patients with progressive RRP who, following 
various previous treatment attempts, were administered with 
systemic bevacizumab therapy at our institution. Previously, 
systemic administration of bevacizumab has been hypoth￾esized as an effective adjuvant treatment modality following 
local intervention. It was reported that bevacizumab may 
have delayed relapse in one case of RRP (7) and was reported 
to potentially improve photoangiolytic laser therapy, when 
used concomitantly and applied topically (8,9). In addition, 
epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition using gefitinib or 
erlotinib demonstrated efficacy in two cases of RRP (11,12).
An immediate and sustained therapeutic effect of systemi￾cally administered bevacizumab was observed in all five RRP 
patients in the present case series. Notably, it was possible 
to document the response to treatment bronchoscopically 
as early as within a few days following the first infusion of 
bevacizumab. Continued anti‑VEGF treatment resulted in 
sustained PR or VGPRs of tracheal or laryngeal papilloma 
manifestations. Remission has been sustained in one patient 
via administration of bevacizumab at prolonged treatment 
intervals of 3‑4 months. Three patients, who exhibited disease 
progression following discontinuation of bevacizumab, 
subsequently responded again following the second cycle of 
treatment. Notably, none of the patients showed papilloma 
progression whilst treatment was ongoing. Patient 2 required 
a laryngectomy due to malignant transformation. The condi￾tion of patient 3 was clinically stable for 9 months following 
Table II. Summary of the clinical efficacy of systemic bevacizumab treatment.

bevacizumab treatment, however, papilloma regrowth was 
observed following treatment discontinuation. After this 
re‑growth, re‑treatment led to a complete resolution of the 
supraglottic lesions. In this patient, an infraglottic lesion did 
not respond to the same extent as the other lesions and was 
abrased; a diagnosis of malignant transformation was excluded. 
In patient 4, with former multilocular tracheobronchial and 
lung parenchyma involvement, a solitary manifestation, 
which was clinically interpreted as granuloma associated with 
mechanical irritation by the distal end of the tracheal cannula, 
had to be abrased. However, histological assessment indicated 
that this particular manifestation was papilloma growth.
At the time of writing the longest period of progression‑free 
survival observed during follow‑up is 27 months in patient 1, 
who is receiving maintenance therapy. Notably, in the present 
case series, it was possible to document the responses to beva￾cizumab therapy with regard to lung parenchyma involvement 
and papillomas of the paranasal sinuses, which are usually not 
accessible to local interventions (Fig. 2).
The rapid response to bevacizumab was accompanied by a 
disappearance of the perivascular edema in papilloma lesions 
as revealed by histopathological analyses of the pre‑ and 
post‑treatment papilloma lesions. This finding is consistent 
with the antibody‑mediated inhibition of VEGF‑induced 
vascular permeability (13). DNA fragmentation assays that 
were performed on papilloma tissues to detect apoptosis did 
not indicate significant differences prior to and following 
the administration of bevacizumab. This indicates that the 
observed therapeutic effect is predominantly mediated by 
modulation of the vasculature and not by induction of apop￾tosis.
In conclusion, the experience of the five present patients 
suggests that systemic bevacizumab presents a highly effective 
treatment option for RRP, offering a unique opportunity even 
for patients with non‑accessible bronchial lesions, lung paren￾chyma involvement, papillomas of the paranasal sinuses, or 
for patients at high risk for voice mutilation by interventional 
therapies. These findings indicate that systemic bevaci￾zumab treatment may have the potential to alter the current 
management of RRP. Whether the treatment will have an 
impact on the frequency of malignant transformation in papil￾lomatosis remains unclear and VEGF‑targeted therapeutic 
strategies require further investigation in clinical trials.
