Abstract
Animal studies generate valuable hypotheses that lead to the conduct of preventive or therapeutic clinical trials. We
assessed whether there is evidence for excess statistical significance in results of animal studies on neurological disorders,
suggesting biases. We used data from meta-analyses of interventions deposited in Collaborative Approach to Meta-Analysis
and Review of Animal Data in Experimental Studies (CAMARADES). The number of observed studies with statistically
significant results (O) was compared with the expected number (E), based on the statistical power of each study under
different assumptions for the plausible effect size. We assessed 4,445 datasets synthesized in 160 meta-analyses on
Alzheimer disease (n = 2), experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (n = 34), focal ischemia (n = 16), intracerebral
hemorrhage (n = 61), Parkinson disease (n = 45), and spinal cord injury (n = 2). 112 meta-analyses (70%) found nominally
(p#0.05) statistically significant summary fixed effects. Assuming the effect size in the most precise study to be a plausible
effect, 919 out of 4,445 nominally significant results were expected versus 1,719 observed (p,1029
). Excess significance was
present across all neurological disorders, in all subgroups defined by methodological characteristics, and also according to
alternative plausible effects. Asymmetry tests also showed evidence of small-study effects in 74 (46%) meta-analyses.
Significantly effective interventions with more than 500 animals, and no hints of bias were seen in eight (5%) meta-analyses.
Overall, there are too many animal studies with statistically significant results in the literature of neurological disorders. This
observation suggests strong biases, with selective analysis and outcome reporting biases being plausible explanations, and
provides novel evidence on how these biases might influence the whole research domain of neurological animal literature.

Introduction
Animal research studies make a valuable contribution in the
generation of hypotheses that might be tested in preventative or
therapeutic clinical trials of new interventions. These data may
establish that there is a reasonable prospect of efficacy in human
disease, which justifies the risk to trial participants.
Several empirical evaluations of the preclinical animal literature
have shown limited concordance between treatment effects in
animal experiments and subsequent clinical trials in humans [1–4].
Systematic assessments of the quality of animal studies have
attributed this translational failure, at least in part, to shortcomings
in experimental design and in the reporting of results [5]. Lack of
randomization, blinding, inadequate application of inclusion and
exclusion criteria, inadequate statistical power, and inappropriate
statistical analysis may compromise internal validity [6,7].
These problems are compounded by different types of reporting
biases [8]. First, bias against publication of ‘‘negative’’ results
(publication bias) or publication after considerable delay (time lag
bias) may exist [9]. Such findings may not be published at all,
published with considerable delay, or published in low impact or low
visibility national journals in comparison to studies with ‘‘positive’’
findings. Second, selective analysis and outcome reporting biases
may emerge when there are many analyses that can be performed,
but only the analysis with the ‘‘best’’ results is presented resulting in
potentially misleading findings [10]. This can take many different
PLOS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 1 July 2013 | Volume 11 | Issue 7 | e1001609

representations such as analyzing many different outcomes but
reporting only one or some of them, or using different statistical
approaches to analyze the same outcome but reporting only one of
them. Third, in theory ‘‘positive’’ results may be totally faked, but
hopefully such fraud is not common. Overall, these biases ultimately
lead to a body of evidence with an inflated proportion of published
studies with statistically significant results.
Detecting these biases is not a straightforward process. There
are several empirical statistical methods that try to detect
publication bias in meta-analyses. The most popular of these are
tests of asymmetry, which evaluate whether small or imprecise
studies give different results from larger more precise ones [11].
However, these methods may not be very sensitive or specific in
the detection of such biases, especially when few studies are
included in a meta-analysis [11–13].
An alternative approach is the excess significance test. This
examines whether too many individual studies in a meta-analysis
report statistically significant results compared with what would be
expected under reasonable assumptions about the plausible effect
size [14]. The excess significance test has low power to detect bias
in single meta-analyses with limited number of studies, but a major
advantage is its applicability to many meta-analyses across a given
field. This increases the power to detect biases that pertain to
larger fields and disciplines rather than just single topics. Previous
applications have found an excess of statistically significant
findings in various human research domains [14–17], but it has
not been applied to animal research studies.
Biases in animal experiments may result in biologically inert or
even harmful substances being taken forward to clinical trials, thus
exposing patients to unnecessary risk and wasting scarce research
funds. It is important to understand the extent of potential biases in
this field, as multiple interventions with seemingly promising results
in animals accumulate in its literature. Therefore, in this paper, we
probed whether there is evidence for excess statistical significance in
animal studies of interventions for neurological diseases using a
large database of 160 interventions and 4,445 study datasets.
Results
Description of Database
Our database included a total of 4,445 pairwise comparisons
from 1,411 unique animal studies that were synthesized in 160
meta-analyses (Table S1). Two meta-analyses (n = 1,054 compar￾isons) pertained to Alzheimer disease (AD), 34 meta-analyses
(n = 483) to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE),
16 meta-analyses (n = 1,403) to focal ischemia, 61 meta-analyses
(n = 424) to intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), 45 meta-analyses
(n = 873) to Parkinson disease (PD), and two meta-analyses
(n = 208) to spinal cord injury (SCI). The median number of
comparisons in each meta-analysis was eight (interquartile range
[IQR], 3–23). The median sample size in each animal study
dataset was 16 (IQR, 11–20), while the median sample size in each
meta-analysis was 135 (IQR, 48–376).
Summary Effect Sizes
Of the 160 meta-analyses, 112 (70%) had found a nominally
(p#0.05) statistically significant summary effect per fixed-effects
synthesis, of which 108 meta-analyses favored the experimental
intervention and only four meta-analyses favored the control
intervention (94 and four for random effects synthesis). The
proportion of the associations that had a nominally statistically
significant effect using the fixed-effects summary ranged from 57%
for ICH to 100% for AD, focal ischemia, and SCI. Table S1
provides information for all 160 meta-analyses. In 47 (29%) meta￾analyses the respective most precise study had a nominally
statistically significant result, as described in Table 1. The effect
size of the most precise study in each meta-analysis was more
conservative than the fixed-effects summary in 114 (71%) meta￾analyses.
Between-Study Heterogeneity
There was statistically significant heterogeneity at p#0.10 for 83
(52%) meta-analyses (Table S1). There was moderate heteroge￾neity (I2= 50%–75%) in 52 (33%) meta-analyses, and high
heterogeneity (I2
.75%) in 22 (14%). The lowest proportion of
significant heterogeneity was observed in meta-analyses of ICH
(36%) and PD (42%), while all other areas had significant
heterogeneities above 70%. Uncertainty around the heterogeneity
estimates was often large, as reflected by wide 95% CI of I2
.
Small-Study Effects
There was evidence of small-study effects in 74 (46%) meta￾analyses (Table S1). These pertained to AD (n= 2 meta-analyses),
EAE (n= 14), focal ischemia (n = 9), ICH (n = 27), PD (n = 21), and
SCI (n = 1).
Excess of Significance
When the plausible effect was assumed to be that of the most
precise study in each meta-analysis, there was evidence (p#0.10) of
excess significance in 49 (31%) meta-analyses (AD n = 2, EAE
n = 13, focal ischemia n = 11, ICH n = 10, PD n = 12, SCI n = 1)
(Table 2), despite the generally low power of the excess significance
test. Under the assumptions of the summary fixed effect being the
plausible effect, there was evidence of excess significance in 23
meta-analyses.
When the excess of significance was examined in aggregate across
all 4,445 studies (Table 3), excess significance was present when
assuming as plausible effect the effect of the most precise study
(p,1.1029
). The observed number of ‘‘positive’’ studies was
O = 1,719, while the expected was E = 919. Excess significance
was also documented in studies of each of the six disease categories.
An excess of ‘‘positive’’ studies was observed also when assuming the
summary fixed effect as the plausible effect size (p,1.1029
).
Similar results were observed in analyses according to method￾ological or reporting characteristics of included studies (Table 4).
Author Summary
Studies have shown that the results of animal biomedical
experiments fail to translate into human clinical trials; this
could be attributed either to real differences in the
underlying biology between humans and animals, to
shortcomings in the experimental design, or to bias in
the reporting of results from the animal studies. We use a
statistical technique to evaluate whether the number of
published animal studies with ‘‘positive’’ (statistically
significant) results is too large to be true. We assess
4,445 animal studies for 160 candidate treatments of
neurological disorders, and observe that 1,719 of them
have a ‘‘positive’’ result, whereas only 919 studies would a
priori be expected to have such a result. According to our
methodology, only eight of the 160 evaluated treatments
should have been subsequently tested in humans. In
summary, we judge that there are too many animal studies
with ‘‘positive’’ results in the neurological disorder litera￾ture, and we discuss the reasons and potential remedies
for this phenomenon.

Excess Significance Bias in Animal Neuro-Studies
PLOS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 3 July 2013 | Volume 11 | Issue 7 | e1001609

Under the assumption of the effect of the most precise study being
the plausible effect, there was evidence of excess significance in all
subgroups. However, the strongest excesses of significance (as
characterized by the ratio of O over E) were recorded specifically
in meta-analyses where small-study effects had also been
documented (O/E = 2.94), in those meta-analyses with the least
precise studies (O/E = 2.94 in the bottom quartile of weight), and
in those meta-analyses where the corresponding studies included a
statement about the presence of conflict of interest (O/E = 3.27).
Under the assumption of the summary fixed effects being the
plausible effect size, excess significance was still formally
documented in the large majority of subgroups, but none had
such extreme O/E ratios (Table 4).
Interventions with Strong Evidence of Association
Only 46 meta-analyses (29%) found interventions with a
nominally significant effect per fixed-effects synthesis and no
evidence of small-study effects or excess significance (when this
calculation was based on the plausible effect being that of the most
precise study) (Figure 1). Of those, only eight had a total sample
size of over 500 animals: one pertained to EAE (myelin basic
protein [MBP]), four pertained to focal ischemia (minocycline,
melatonin, nicotinamide, nitric oxide species [NOS] donors), one
pertained to ICH (stem cells), and two to PD (bromocriptine,
quinpirole).
Discussion
We evaluated 160 meta-analyses of animal studies describing six
neurological conditions, most of which had found a nominally
(p#0.05) statistically significant fixed-effects summary favoring the
experimental intervention. The number of nominally statistically
significant results in the component studies of these meta-analyses
was too large to be true, and this evidence of excess significance
was present in studies across all six neurological diseases. Overall,
only eight of the 160 meta-analyses had nominally significant
results, no suggestion of bias related to small-study effects or excess
of significant findings, and evidence procured from over 500
animals.
Animal studies represent a considerable proportion of the
biomedical literature with approximately five million papers
indexed in PubMed [8]. These studies are conducted to do a
first-pass evaluation of the effectiveness and safety of therapeutic
interventions. However, there is great discrepancy between the
intervention effects found in preclinical animal studies and those
found in clinical trials of humans with most of these interventions
rarely achieving successful translation [2,3,18]. Possible explana￾tions for this failure include differences in the underlying biology
and pathophysiology between humans and animals, but also the
presence of biases in study design or reporting of the animal
literature.
Our empirical evaluation of animal studies on neurological
disorders found a significant excess of nominally statistically
significant studies, which suggests the presence of strong study
design or reporting biases. Prior evaluations of animal studies had
also noted that alarmingly the vast majority of the published
studies had statistically significant associations, and had suggested
high prevalence of publication bias [9,19], resulting in spurious
claims of effectiveness. We observed excessive nominally signifi￾cant results in all subgroup categories defined by random
allocation of treatment, blinded induction of treatment, blinded
assessment of the outcome, sample size calculation, or compliance
to animal welfare. This suggests that the excess of significance in
animal studies of neurological disorders may reflect reporting
biases that operate regardless of study design features. It is
nevertheless possible that reporting biases are worst in fields with
poor study quality, although this was not clear in our evaluation.
Deficiencies in random allocation and blinded induction of the
treatment or blinded assessment of the outcome have been
associated with inflated efficacy estimates in other evaluations of
animal research [20,21].
We also documented very prominent excess of significant results
(observed ‘‘positive’’ results being three times the number of
expected) for interventions that had also evidence of small-study
effects and in meta-analyses with the least precise studies. Both of
these observations are commensurate with reporting bias being the
explanation for the excess significance, with bias being more
prominent in smaller studies and becoming more discernible when
sufficiently precise studies are also available.
Conventional publication bias (non-publication of neutral/
negative results), may exist in the literature of animal studies on
neurological disorders. Our evaluation showed that 46% of the
meta-analyses had evidence of small-study effects, which may
signal publication bias. However, this association is not specific,
and the Egger test used to evaluate small-study effects is
underpowered especially when it evaluates few and small studies
in a meta-analysis [13]. It is also likely that selective outcome or
analysis reporting biases exist. The animal studies on neurological
disorders used many different outcomes and methods to measure
each outcome as can be seen across the Table S1, and they may
have used different statistical analysis techniques and applied
several different rules for inclusion and exclusion of data. Thus, it
is possible that individual studies may have measured different
outcomes, tested a variety of inclusion and exclusion criteria and

Excess Significance Bias in Animal Neuro-Studies
PLOS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 5 July 2013 | Volume 11 | Issue 7 | e1001609

performed several statistical analyses, but reported only a few
findings guided in part by the significance of the results. Detection
of such biases is difficult and no formal well-developed statistical
test exists. Evidence is usually indirect and requires access to the
study protocol or even communication with the investigators.
In contrast to the above, we found eight interventions with
strong and statistically significant benefits in animal models and
without evidence of small-study effects or excess significance.
However, the data for these interventions may still have
compromised internal validity; having identified one of these,
melatonin, as a candidate treatment for stroke, we tested efficacy
in an animal study designed specifically to avoid some of the
prevalent sources of bias. Under these circumstances melatonin
had no significant effect on outcome [22].
It is interesting to discuss whether human experimental
evidence for these interventions is more promising than the
generally disappointing results seen for most interventions that
have previously given some signal of effectiveness in animals. A
meta-analysis of 33 animal studies showed that administration of
MBP reduced the severity of EAE, which is an animal model for
multiple sclerosis. However, a phase III randomized clinical trial
(RCT) in humans showed no significant differences between MBP
and placebo [23]. Minocycline, a tetracycline antibiotic with
potential neuroprotective effects, showed improvements in stroke
scales in two human RCTs, but these were small phase II trials
[24,25] and have not been confirmed in larger studies. Several
animal studies of melatonin, an endogenously produced antiox￾idant, have reported a beneficial effect on infarct volume [26], but
RCTs with clinical endpoints in humans don’t exist. A small RCT
did not show significant differences in oxidative or inflammatory
stress parameters between melatonin and placebo [27]. Adminis￾tration of nicotinamide, the amide of vitamin B3, to animals with
focal ischemia reduced the infarct volume [19], but RCTs have
not evaluated clinical outcomes in relation to nicotinamide [28].
Several animal studies of NOS donors, like the anti-anginal drug
nicorandil, have shown reductions in infarct volume, and RCTs
have also shown that nicorandil improves cardiac function in
patients with acute myocardial infarction [29,30]. Granulocyte￾colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), a growth factor that stimulates
the bone marrow to produce granulocytes and stem cells, has been
reported in animal studies to improve the neurobehavioral score in
animals with ICH. Some similar evidence exists from RCTs of
stroke patients, but it consists of small phase II trials [31,32], and
an unpublished phase III trial was neutral (Ringelstein P et al.,
International Stroke Conference, Feb 2012). Bromocriptine and
quinpirole are dopamine agonists that have been successfully used
in animal studies of PD [33]. Bromocriptine is approved to treat
PD in humans [34], but no human trial exists for quinpirole. In

spite of this patchy record, interventions with strong evidence of
efficacy and no hints of bias in animals may be prioritized for
further testing in humans.
Some limitations should be acknowledged in our work. First,
asymmetry and excess significance tests offer hints of bias, not
definitive proof thereof. Most individual animal studies were small
with a median total sample size of 16 animals, and a median
number of eight comparisons in each meta-analysis. Therefore, the
interpretation of the excess significance test for the results of a
single meta-analysis should be very cautious. A negative test for
excess significance does not exclude the potential for bias [14].
The most useful application of the excess significance test is to give
an overall impression about the average level of bias affecting the
whole field of animal studies on neurological disorders.
Second, the exact estimation of excess statistical significance is
influenced by the choice of plausible effect size. We performed
analyses using different plausible effect sizes, including the effect of
the most precise study in each meta-analysis, and the summary
fixed effect; these yielded similar findings. Effect inflation may
affect even the results of the most precise studies, since often these

were not necessarily very large or may have had inherent biases
themselves, or both. Thus, our estimates of the extent of excess
statistical significance are possibly conservative, and the problem
may be more severe.
Third, we evaluated a large number of meta-analyses on six
neurological conditions, but our findings might not necessarily be
representative of the whole animal literature. However, biases and
methodological deficits have been described for many animal
studies regardless of disease domain [1,2,21].
In conclusion, the literature of animal studies on neurological
disorders is probably subject to considerable bias. This does not
mean that none of the observed associations in the literature are
true. For example, we showed evidence of eight strong and
statistically significant associations without evidence of small-study
effects or excess significance. However, only two (NOS donors and
focal ischemia, and bromocriptine and PD) of even these eight
associations seem to have convincing RCT data in humans. We
support measures to minimize bias in animal studies and to
maximize successful translation into human applications of
promising interventions [35]. Study design, conduct, and reporting
of animal studies can be improved by following published
guidelines for reporting animal research [35,36]. Publication and
selective reporting biases may be diminished by preregistering
experimental animal studies. Access to the study protocol and also
to raw data and analyses would allow verification of their results,
and make their integration with other parallel or future efforts
easier. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses and large consortia
conducting multi-centre animal studies should become routine to
ensure the best use of existing animal data, and to aid in the
selection of the most promising treatment strategies to enter
human clinical trials.
Materials and Methods
Study Identification
We used data from published and unpublished meta-analyses of
interventions tested in animal studies of six neurological diseases
(AD, EAE, focal ischemia, ICH, PD, and SCI) deposited in the
database of Collaborative Approach to Meta-Analysis and Review
of Animal Data in Experimental Studies (CAMARADES), which
is an international collaboration established in 2004 with an aim to
support meta-analyses of animal data [20]. The database is
representative of the literature, and includes details of each
individual experiment. Out of the total of 14 published meta￾analyses of animal stroke studies, 11 are part of the CAMAR￾ADES database. Animal studies report a variety of outcome
measures often measured from the same cohort of animals. To
ensure independence, we only used one outcome analysis per
animal cohort. Where multiple outcomes were reported from a
single cohort, we chose the one that was most frequently found in
each meta-analysis. We abstracted the following information from
each study: publication year, intervention, outcome, animal
cohort, effect size and standard error, number of affected animals
in the treatment and control group, and ten binary methodological
criteria (peer-reviewed publication, statement of control of
temperature, random allocation to treatment or control, blinded
induction of treatment, blinded assessment of outcome, use of
anesthetic without significant intrinsic neuroprotective activity,
Figure 1. Venn diagrams of the meta-analyses of animal studies of neurological disorders. We plotted the number of studies with a total
sample size of at least 500 animals; those which showed a nominally (p#0.05) statistically significant effect per fixed-effects synthesis; those that had
no evidence of small-study effects; and those that had no evidence of excess significance. The numbers represent the studies that have two or more
of the above characteristics according to the respective overlapping areas.

appropriate animal model, sample size calculation, compliance
with animal welfare regulations, and statement of potential conflict
of interest), which were based on relevant guidelines for reporting
animal research [35–38].
Estimation of Summary Effect and Heterogeneity
For each meta-analysis, we estimated the summary effect size
and its confidence intervals using both fixed and random effect
models [39]. All outcomes included in the database were measured
on a continuous scale, and hence we used the standardized mean
difference as the effect size. We also tested for between-study
heterogeneity estimating the p-value of the x2
-based Cochran Q
test, and the I2 metric of inconsistency. Q is obtained by the
weighted sum of the squared differences of the observed effect in
each study minus the fixed summary effect [40]. I2 ranges from
0% to 100% and describes the percentage of variation across
studies that is attributed to heterogeneity rather than chance [41].
The corresponding 95% CIs were also calculated [42].
Asymmetry Tests for Small-Study Effects
We evaluated whether there is evidence for small-study effects,
i.e., whether smaller studies give substantially different estimates of
effect size compared to larger studies. This may offer a hint for
publication or other selective reporting biases, but they may also
reflect genuine heterogeneity, chance or other reasons for
differences between small and large studies [11]. We applied the
regression asymmetry test proposed by Egger et al [43]. A p#0.10
with more conservative effect in larger studies was considered
evidence for small-study effects.
Evaluation of Excess Significance
We applied the excess significance test, which is an exploratory
test that evaluates whether there is a relative excess of formally
significant findings in the published literature due to any reason.
This test evaluates whether the observed number of studies (O)
with nominally statistically significant results (‘‘positive’’ studies,
p#0.05) within a meta-analysis differs from their expected number
(E). ‘‘Positive’’ findings were counted in both directions, i.e., when
the experimental intervention is more beneficial compared to the
control, as well as when the experimental intervention is harmful.
If there is no excess significance bias, then O = E. The greater the
difference between O and E, the greater is the extent of excess
significance bias.
We used a binomial test, as previously presented in detail [14].
This test evaluates whether the number of ‘‘positive’’ studies,
among those in a meta-analysis, is too large based on the power
that these studies have to detect plausible effects at a= 0.05. The
O versus E comparison is performed separately for each meta￾analysis, and it is also extended to many meta-analyses after
summing O and E across meta-analyses.
E is calculated in each meta-analysis by the sum of the statistical
power estimates for each component study. The estimated power
of each component study depends on the plausible effect size for
the tested animal study association. The true effect size for any
meta-analysis is not known. We performed the main analysis using
the effect size of the most precise study (with the smallest standard
error) in a meta-analysis as the plausible effect. The estimate from
this most precise study, other things being equal, should be closer
to the true estimate than the results of less precise studies,
especially if biases affect predominantly the literature of smaller
studies (small-study effects) [44–46]. Additionally, we conducted
sensitivity analysis using as the plausible effect size the fixed effects
summary from each meta-analysis. In the presence of bias these
summary fixed effects may be larger than the true effects, and this
situation may arise even for the effect estimate of the most precise
study, albeit to a smaller extent. Therefore, all these assumptions
tend to be conservative in testing for excess significance. We did
not use the random effects summary, because it tends to be overtly
inflated in the presence of small-study effects, as the small studies
receive increased relative weight in random effects calculations
[47].
The power of each study was calculated using the Wilcoxon
rank sum test under the family of Lehmann alternative hypotheses
in a freely available software [48], which is an exact calculation
suitable for the very small sample sizes that are typical of many
animal studies [49]. Excess significance for single meta-analyses
was claimed at p#0.10 (one-sided p#0.05 with O.E as previously
proposed), since the test is expected to have low power to detect a
specific excess of significant findings especially when there are a
few ‘‘positive’’ studies [14].
We assessed excess significance in aggregate across all six
neurological diseases, and separately in each one of them, as
selective reporting bias may affect different research domains to a
different extent. These domains may also have different typical
magnitudes of effect sizes for the tested interventions, and different
analytical biases even if research is sometimes conducted by the
same teams across various domains.
The excess significance test was also performed in subgroups:
for meta-analyses with I2
#50% and .50%, as values exceeding
50% are typically considered evidence of large heterogeneity
beyond chance [50]; by evidence or not of small-study effects as
per Egger’s test; by whether the summary fixed effect of the
respective meta-analysis was nominally statistically significant or
not; by quartiles of the weight of the most precise study for each
meta-analysis; by use of random allocation of the treatment or not;
by use of blinded induction of the treatment or not; by use of
blinded assessment of the outcome or not; by whether the sample
size calculation was described or not; by whether the study
reported to comply to the animal welfare regulations or not; and
by whether potential conflicts of interest were reported or not.
