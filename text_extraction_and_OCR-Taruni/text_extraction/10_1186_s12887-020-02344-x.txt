Abstract
Background: Young children and those with chronic medical conditions are at risk for complications of influenza
including cardiopulmonary compromise. Here we aim to examine risks of mortality, clinical complications in
children with congenital heart disease (CHD) hospitalized for influenza.
Methods: We analyzed data from in-hospital pediatric patients from 2003, 2006, 2009, 2012 and 2016 using the
nationally representative Kids Inpatient Database (KID). We included children 1 year and older and used weighted
data to compare the incidence of in-hospital mortality and rates of complications such as respiratory failure, acute
kidney injury, need for mechanical ventilation, arrhythmias and myocarditis.
Results: Data from the KID estimated 125,470 children who were admitted with a diagnosis of influenza infection.
Out of those, 2174(1.73%) patients had discharge diagnosis of CHD. Children with CHD who required hospitalization
for influenza had higher in-hospital mortality (2.0% vs 0.5%), with an adjusted OR (aOR) of 2.8 (95% CI: 1.7–4.5).
Additionally, acute respiratory failure and acute kidney failure were more likely among patients with CHD, with aOR
of 1.8 (95% CI: 1.5–2.2) and aOR of 2.2 (95% CI: 1.5–3.1), respectively. Similarly, the rate of mechanical ventilatory
support was higher in patients with CHD compared to those without, 14.1% vs 5.6%, aOR of 1.9 (95% CI: 1.6–2.3).
Median length of hospital stay in children with CHD was longer than those without CHD [4 (IQR: 2–8) days vs. 2
(IQR: 2–4) days]. Outcomes were similar between those with severe vs non-severe CHD.
Conclusions: Children with CHD who require hospital admission for influenza are at significantly increased risk for
in-hospital mortality, morbidities, emphasizing the need to reinforce preventative measures (e.g. vaccination,
personal hygiene) in this particularly vulnerable population.

Background
Influenza infection generally presents as an acute self￾limiting illness in healthy children, but it can cause sig￾nificant morbidity and mortality in high-risk children.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
estimated around 500,000 individuals were hospitalized,
causing more than 34,000 deaths during the 2018–2019
influenza season [1]. Children <5 years, and <2 years and
those with chronic medical conditions are at risk of
complications from influenza, including pneumonia and
acute respiratory failure.
Congenital heart disease (CHD) is prevalent in 1% of
the population [2]. These children are at increased risks
for complications of influenza and therefore routine an￾nual influenza immunization is strongly recommended
in these children. However, there are only a handful of

studies in the literature reporting mortality and com￾plications related to influenza among children with
chronic diseases [3, 4]. Similarly, there is also very
limited information on complications of influenza in￾fection among children with CHD. Here, we report a
recent nationwide cross-sectional retrospective study
based on the Kids’ Inpatient Database (KID) of the
United States to examine risks of mortality, in￾hospital complications including respiratory failure,
acute kidney injury and need for mechanical ventila￾tion, as well as length of hospital stay as a result of
influenza infection among children with CHD.
Methods
Study population and variables
We analyzed data of hospital discharge records of pa￾tients with the nationally representative Kids’ Inpatient
Database (KID) for 2003, 2006, 2009, 2012 and 2016.
The data was compiled by the Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality (AHRQ) and was generated for
Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) in col￾laboration with public and private statewide data organi￾zations. The KID is a stratified, cross-sectional database
that includes discharge data for approximately 10% of
newborn discharges and 80% of other discharges in the
United States. KID is published every 3–4 years and the
latest data available is from 2016.
Using International Classification of Disease, Ninth
and Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM
and ICD-10-CM), we identified hospitalized children
with CHD, influenza infection, and other variables stud￾ied. To include only CHD, we excluded patent ductus
arteriosus, single umbilical artery and other anomalies of
peripheral vascular system from analysis. Please see Sup￾plementary Table 1 for ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM
codes used in the manuscript. We included children 1
year and older, excluding the infants(< 1 year) to
minimize the confounding effect on the outcome vari￾ables, as most of the surgeries for CHD occur during in￾fancy and we also wanted to minimize the effect of
patent ductus arteriosus especially on preterm infants,
which is minimal after infancy.
Outcome variables
The primary outcome of interest was comparison of in￾hospital mortality between those children with influenza
infection with and without concomitant CHD. Second￾ary outcomes were acute respiratory failure, acute kidney
injury, need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV),
non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV), myocardi￾tis, tachyarrhythmias, heart block, sudden cardiac arrest,
need for ECMO and length of hospital stay.
Statistical analysis
We performed descriptive and inferential statistics using
the KID complex survey design, taking into account for
clusters, strata, and weighting. For continuous variables
such as age and length of stay, we reported median with
interquartile range (IQR). Weight-adjusted Chi-square
tests were used for categorical variables and weight￾adjusted Wilcoxon signed rank tests for continuous vari￾ables as the continuous variables were not evenly
distributed.
The variables used in the multivariable analysis were
carefully selected after rigorous review of the literature.
During selection, we were careful to identify variables
that had ICD codes that were reliable and consistent.
For regression modeling, univariable analyses of each
variable of interest were performed first, followed by a
multivariable analysis incorporating additional variables
(age, sex, race/ethnicity, discharge quarter, year of ad￾mission, history of asthma, presence of respiratory and
musculoskeletal congenital anomalies, presence of
chromosomal anomalies) to determine the effects of co￾variates and confounding variables on the outcome of
interest. We performed logistic regression analysis for
the odds ratios (ORs) of the risk of mortality, acute re￾spiratory failure, acute kidney injury and need for mech￾anical ventilation with and without concomitant CHD.
We assessed differences in length of hospital stay by
using multiple linear regression analysis.
We then performed analysis to compare the risk be￾tween severe and non-severe CHD. Severe CHD in￾cludes truncus arteriosus, d-transposition of great
arteries(d-TGA), double outlet right ventricle(DORV),
l-transposition of great arteries(L-TGA), tetralogy of
Fallot, hypoplastic left heart syndrome(HLHS), other
single ventricles, atrio-ventricular septal defect(AVSD),
pulmonary atresia, tricuspid atresia, interrupted aortic
arch, total anomalous pulmonary venous return(TAPV
R). Every congenital heart disease without ICD codes
for severe CHD were included as non-severe CHD. In
addition, if a child has a diagnosis of severe CHD and
non-severe CHD, they are counted as severe CHD,
e.g. if a child has d-transposition of great arteries(d￾TGA) and VSD, they are counted as d-TGA and not
as VSD.
Weights provided by HCUP were used in all ana￾lyses to account for the complex sampling design and
clustering for the analysis. All statistical analyses were
performed using Stata statistical software (version
15.1), R version 3.6.0 [5] and R Studio 1.2 [6]. (http://
www.R-project.org) Complex survey design of the
KID was accounted for using the survey package [7].
Figures were produced using the ggplot2 and patch￾work packages. Tables were generated using the table￾one package [8].

Results
The retrieved records based on the inclusion and exclu￾sion criteria estimated 125,470 children who were admit￾ted with a diagnosis of influenza. Of those, 2174 (1.73%)
had a diagnosis of CHD. 57,055 (45.5%) were female.
Median age of children with influenza was 5 (IQR: 2–11)
years. The number of cases were higher in 2009 com￾pared to other years probably due to the H1N1 influenza
pandemic during that year. More children were hospital￾ized in the October to December quarter compared to
the other quarters. Hospitalization was more common in
younger children compared to the older children and ad￾olescents and this finding was consistent overall all years
studied (Fig. 1).
Regarding the chronic medical conditions in the hospi￾talized children, history of asthma was present in 27.8%
of hospitalized children, while only 0.64% of the children
had congenital anomalies of the respiratory system. 1.9%
of the children had chromosomal anomalies.
The overall in-hospital mortality rate for children hos￾pitalized with influenza was 0.54% (n = 687). 5.4% of
children had respiratory failure and 4.6% required inva￾sive mechanical ventilation. Median hospitalization
length was 2(IQR: 2–4) days. Baseline characteristics of
children with influenza are reported in Table 1.
The children admitted with influenza who have con￾comitant CHD were younger than those without CHD,
median age 3 (IQR: 2–7) years vs 5 (IQR: 2–11) years,
P < 0.001.
History of asthma was more common in children with￾out CHD [27.9% (n = 34,410) in non-CHD patients vs
24.0% (n = 521) in CHD patients], while congenital anom￾alies, specifically respiratory anomalies, musculoskeletal
anomalies and chromosomal anomalies, were significantly
more common in CHD group (Table 2).
Regarding in hospital complications between those
with CHD and without CHD, tachyarrhythmias [2.5%
(n = 54) vs 0.4% (n = 460), p < 0.001] conduction disor￾ders [3.4% (n = 75) vs 0.2% (n = 238), p < 0.001] and
sudden cardiac arrest [0.8% (n = 18) vs 0.2% (n = 232), p <
0.001] were more common in the CHD group. (Table 2).
In-hospital mortality was higher in children with CHD
2.0% (n = 44) compared to those without CHD
0.52%(n = 643). (Fig. 2a.) In univariable logistic regres￾sion analysis, patients with CHD had increased risk of
mortality by 3.9 fold, with an OR of 3.9 (95% CI 2.7–5.7,
p < 0.001). We then performed multivariable logistic re￾gression analysis with additional confounders including
age, sex, year of admission, race, discharge quarter, the
presence of chronic medical conditions specifically
asthma, respiratory and chronomosomal anomalies. In
this model, we found that patients with CHD had an in￾creased odds of mortality by 2.8 fold, with an adjusted
odds ratio (aOR) of 2.8 (95% CI: 1.7–4.5, p < 0.001). In
this model, the presence of respiratory and chromosomal
congenital anomalies increased risk of mortality
(Table 3).
Similarly, we performed univariable and multivariable
regression analyses to compare the risk of acute respira￾tory failure and acute kidney injury in patients with and
without CHD. In a multivariable logistic regression
model, acute respiratory failure was more common
among those with CHD compared to those without
CHD, with an aOR of 1.8 (95% CI: 1.5–2.2, p < 0.001)
(Fig. 2b, Table 4). In this model, history of asthma, re￾spiratory and chromosomal congenital anomalies

increased risk of mortality significantly. The risk of acute
kidney injury was also higher in patients with CHD even
after adjusting for confounders, with an aOR of 2.2 (95%
CI: 1.5–3.1, p < 0.001) (Supplementary Table 2). The rate
of mechanical ventilatory support was higher in patients
with CHD compared to those without [14.1% vs 5.6%,
aOR of 1.9 (95% CI: 1.6–2.3, p < 0.001)] (Supplementary
Table 3).
Median length of hospital stay in children with CHD
was longer than those without CHD [4 (IQR: 2–8) days
vs. 2 (IQR: 2–4) days, p < 0.001].

We then divided the CHD group into those with se￾vere CHD and non-severe CHD and performed analysis
to compare the incidence of complications between
these two groups. We found that most of the major
complications were very similar between these groups.
(Supplementary Table 4).
Discussion
Using the KID 2003, 2006, 2009, 2012 and 2016, a
large national database of more than 125,000 pediatric
influenza-associated hospitalizations, we reported the
following major findings: 1) presence of CHD in￾creased the risk of in-hospital mortality in children
with influenza infection, 2) concomitant CHD was
more likely to be associated with acute respiratory
failure, acute kidney injury, need for invasive and
noninvasive mechanical ventilation, myocarditis and
need for ECMO, 3) length of hospital stay was higher
in CHD with influenza, and 4) there were no signifi￾cant differences in primary and secondary outcomes
between severe and non-severe CHD.
Higher rates of in-hospital all cause mortality in pa￾tients with CHD seem reasonable since children with
CHD could already have limited cardiac and respiratory
reserves and therefore may not tolerate increased cardio￾respiratory demand during active infections. Addition￾ally, children who have had thoracotomy could have
restrictive lung physiology making them more prone to
pulmonary complications compared to otherwise healthy
children. Specifically, in those children with CHD,
introduction of pro-inflammatory and oxidative media￾tors by an acute systemic inflammatory response caused
by an influenza infection may lead to further comprise
in cardiac function [9]. In addition, we also found that
the respiratory and cardiac complications are higher in
those patients with CHD. These complications may also
contribute to overall increased mortality.
Another important finding we report is the similarities
in the mortality and major hospital complications be￾tween those with severe CHD and non-severe CHD.
Most of the severe CHD patients would have undergone
surgical repair in infancy, and after surgical repair of the
lesions, their cardiac hemodynamics probably improved.
That potentially is the reason that they are just as vul￾nerable as those non-severe CHD, but not significantly
higher.
The cardiovascular complications of influenza have
been reported, including myocarditis, arrhythmias,
cardiac arrest and death [10]. However, the exact mech￾anism how influenza infection causes adverse cardiovas￾cular outcomes remains elusive. There is some evidence
suggesting that activation of the inflammatory pathways
may be responsible for acute myocardial injury and dys￾function [11].
We found that the prevalence of asthma was more
common in children without CHD compared to those
hospitalized for influenza with CHD (27.9% vs 24%).
We are not entirely sure if this will hold true for
children who are not hospitalized. Literature lacks
large studies reporting association between asthma
and CHD.

The World Health Organization estimated 5–10% of
adults and 20–30% of children are infected with influ￾enza worldwide, resulting in 290,000–650,000 deaths an￾nually [12]. We also know that in the pediatric
population, influenza vaccination offers significant
protection against severe influenza disease and
influenza-related hospitalization [13, 14]. Therefore, an￾nual influenza vaccination for children is recommended
to reduce adverse health impacts and to prevent severe
complications. However, vaccination coverage for chil￾dren in the influenza season 2018–2019 was only 62.6%
according to the Center for Disease Control and Preven￾tion of the United States [15]. There are very limited
data on the vaccination rate for influenza among chil￾dren with heart diseases including CHD. A recent Israeli
study reported 36% vaccination rate among children
with heart disease [16]. In a report on influenza-related
death of 291 pediatric patients from the 2010–2011 to
the 2013–2014 seasons, 30 children had CHD or ac￾quired cardiac disease, only 23% of whom received
influenza vaccination [17]. Studies have reported that in￾fluenza vaccination has been associated with a re￾duced risk for all-cause mortality in patients with
heart failure or with other cardiovascular disease, em￾phasizing the importance of influenza vaccination, es￾pecially in those with chronic medical conditions
including CHD patients [18, 19].
Using the KID, our study provided a larger sample size
based on population sampling of hospitalized pediatric
patients with influenza, which was the main strength of
our study. However, there were multiple limitations with
this approach. First, data in the KID were not collected
for research, but were for medical coding and billing.
Therefore, incorrect or missing information may poten￾tially exist. Second, KID captures only inpatient records,
so the findings may not be applicable to the outpatient
settings and to those children with chronic cardiac dis￾ease who are not hospitalized. Third, there was no infor￾mation on the accuracy of the diagnosis. This data does
not include information on prior influenza vaccination

and how influenza cases were confirmed and verified.
Moreover, we were not able to study the influence of
vaccination status on clinical outcomes using this data￾base. In addition, due to limitation of the database, we
could not report details on anatomy and physiology of
CHD like the status of residual lesion, whether they have
decreased ventricular function, functional status of chil￾dren and timing of surgical repair or palliation.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our findings indicate that children with
influenza infection and a concomitant CHD are at in￾creased risk of in-hospital mortality and adverse clinical
outcomes. Vaccination rates in children, especially those
with chronic disease conditions such as CHD are lower,
despite the evidence that influenza vaccination decreases
severity of the illness, mortality and complications in pa￾tients with chronic medical conditions. We recommend
health care providers, families, and official organizations
to work together to increase influenza vaccination rates
in all children, especially in those with chronic medical
conditions, to prevent morbidity and mortality.
