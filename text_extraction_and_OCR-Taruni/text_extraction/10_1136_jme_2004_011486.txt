The shortage of organs for transplantation has led research￾ers to look for new techniques to expand the donor pool.
Preconditioning strategies have the potential to protect
organs from transplant associated injury or may improve
the function of substandard organs so that they become
suitable for transplantation. Translating this type of technol￾ogy to the clinical setting raises ethical issues, particularly
relating to the deceased donor. It is important that society has
the opportunity to discuss the issues raised by implementation
of preconditioning strategies before they are implemented
rather than as a reaction to them.
Organ transplantation has been one of the great medical
successes of our times. It has revolutionised the
treatment of organ failure, often allowing the recipient
to resume a normal lifestyle.1 Every advance has led to an
increased demand for organs for transplantation and despite
major improvements in immunosuppression, organ preserva￾tion, and operating techniques, patients continue to die on
waiting lists due to the shortage of donors.2 The number of
potential recipients in the United Kingdom awaiting organ
transplantation has increased annually, reaching more than
7000 by March 2004.2 New sources of organs, such as living
donors, split livers, and non-heartbeating donors, have
increased available organs to a degree; however, these
developments have failed to keep pace with the decline in the
available number of cadaveric organs. Novel therapies such as
stem cell technology and bioartificial livers hold promise for the
future, but have not yet fulfilled their potential. There remains,
therefore, a requirement for solid organ transplantation that is
unlikely to recede in the near future.
Preconditioning is a developing technique, which is currently
making the transition from an experimental concept to a
practical therapeutic option.3 The basic premise is that treat￾ment before a known injury occurs can be used to minimise the
severity of that injury. This principle has widespread application
in many areas of medicine, particularly in surgical disciplines.4
Solid organ transplantation, with its attendant ischaemia/
reperfusion injury, represents an area where preconditioning
of the donor or the donated organs could make a great
contribution,5 6 potentially reducing primary non-function and
early graft failure, and thus the requirement for retransplanta￾tion. There is also experimental evidence that preconditioning
may allow organs that would currently be discarded to be used,
thus expanding the organ pool. In this paper we discuss the
practical and ethical issues involved in implementing precondi￾tioning strategies in solid organ transplantation.
PRECONDITIONING
Practical implementation
The term preconditioning encompasses many different
techniques, which all rely on harnessing aspects of the
innate protective mechanisms that human cells use to
survive stress. Broadly speaking there are two approaches
to induce preconditioning: physical and pharmacological.
Physical techniques include ischaemic preconditioning7
and heat treatment.8 9 Pharmacological techniques include
the administration of drugs, cytokines, and gene transfer
techniques.10–12
Pharmacological preconditioning, with drugs such as
cyclosporin, would require the commencement of an addi￾tional drug infusion. This would be in addition to a range of
infusions that the donor would already be receiving, and so
would make little difference to the medical management of
the donor. Heat preconditioning requires elevation of the
body temperature by several degrees. This could be achieved
by the use of warming blankets, increasing the temperature
of inhaled gases with which the donor is ventilated, heating
intravenous fluids, and possibly the use of heat lamps.
Ischaemic preconditioning would be applied when the organs
were being removed. This is achieved by commencing the
retrieval operation as normal and then, immediately prior to
perfusing the donor with cold preservation solution, clamp￾ing the blood vessels supplying the liver for ten minutes, and
subsequently unclamping them for ten minutes to allow
recovery. Perfusion with the cold preservation fluid would
then be commenced and the remainder of the organ retrieval
procedure performed as normal. Thus the practical imple￾mentation of preconditioning treatments ranges from the
minor addition of a drug or a modification of operative
technique to more interventional options such as whole body
hyperthermia.
Clinical precedents
The optimum management of heartbeating organ donors
currently involves the administration of a variety of drugs
and infusions to maintain the organs in a suitable condition
for transplantation. Preconditioning agents would be used to
improve the target organs, rather than merely limiting the
detrimental effects of brain stem death. Thus preconditioning
crosses the boundary from maintenance to treatment, a fact
which could give rise to ethical concerns. There are, however,
several precedents for this type of active treatment. Hormonal
resuscitation with triiodothyronine, vasopressin, and methyl￾prednisolone is administered to heart transplant donors,13
with the aim of correcting the endocrine imbalances that
occur after brain stem death. These are active treatments,
intended to increase the number of organs suitable for
transplantation. They differ from preconditioning, however,
in that they represent maintenance rather than therapeutic
measures. Thus the boundary between donor mainten￾ance, optimisation, and preconditioning can be considered
indistinct.
Clinical application of preconditioning
There are several applications for preconditioning. Each
individual setting requires different considerations with

regard to both the practical implementation of a precondi￾tioning strategy, and the ethical issues it raises. Donor organs
for transplantation currently come from three sources: living
donors, brain stem dead heartbeating donors, and non￾heartbeating donors. The application of preconditioning
strategies raises both ethical and practical issues in each of
these three donor groups. Similarly, different methods of
preconditioning may be more or less acceptable to families of
donors and any treatments used for preconditioning may
require lack of objection or assent additional to that obtained
for the actual donation.
ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Lack of objection/assent
Consent for organ donation has been a contentious issue in
the past. In the UK, even when the potential donor carries an
organ donor card, the assent or lack of objection of the next
of kin is sought.14 The introduction of the Human Tissue Bill
may change the emphasis of this process, giving greater
priority to the autonomy of the donor. The provision of in
depth details of the retrieval process required to explain a
preconditioning strategy could potentially lead to a with￾drawal of lack of objection to organ donation. Thus
describing the preconditioning strategies, or asking for
explicit assent to apply them, could potentially have a
negative effect on donation rates. This issue must be
considered in the light of potential benefits to society as
a whole, of advancing science, and improving medical
outcomes.
There is an alternative argument that preconditioning
represents part of the normal process of organ harvesting and
therefore should not require further assent or lack of
objection beyond that associated with organ donation itself.
Indeed, in his treatise on the ethics of organ donation, Price
suggests that ‘‘where an individual has requested that his/her
organs be used for transplantation after death, it seems
correct to infer that permission is granted for procedures
which form part of the routine preliminaries to transplanta￾tion without seriously compromising the patient in any
way’’.15
Law and ethics
Even where there is no explicit authorisation of procedures
for maintaining donors and their organs, they are not
necessarily unlawful. Although explicit legislative provision
to cover organ preconditioning techniques may be desirable,
it is far more important that society endorses the concept that
preconditioning strategies in donors to improve organ
function and outcome are ethically acceptable and clinically
warranted. This would avoid the difficulties that occurred
with elective ventilation, which began in the UK in
accordance with Home Office directives and agreement, but
which has since been abandoned due to legal and ethical
concerns.16 17 Such legislation exists in Sweden, and it states:
‘‘Once it has been established that death has occurred,
measures may be taken, if appropriate, in order to preserve
organs or other biological material pending
transplantation…Unless there are special circumstances,
such measures should not continue beyond 24 hours’’
(Price,15 p 170). With regard to organ procurement for
transplantation, the UK Human Tissue Bill currently being
considered by parliament states that ‘‘it shall be lawful...to
take steps for the purpose of preserving that part [part of a
body] for use in transplantation, and to retain the body for
that purpose’’. However, this authorisation ‘‘shall only
extend to the taking of the minimum steps necessary…and
to the use of the least invasive procedure’’.18 It is unclear
whether such authorisation would extend to preconditioning
techniques.
The timing of certain preconditioning treatments may be
crucial, particularly with regard to agents that may require a
significant length of time prior to harvest to provide the
beneficial effect. Thus there may be the requirement to
commence administration of the agent before lack of
objection is obtained. Although this may be against normal
principles, this type of approach has previously been
approved by ethical committees and has been used in clinical
trials on organ donors.19 This is also analogous to the
management required for uncontrolled non-heartbeating
donors where, if the coroner agrees, cooling is commenced
as soon as practicable, and then withdrawn if an objection to
donation is expressed.20 This is provided for in Dutch law,
which declares that necessary measures to maintain the
organ in a suitable condition for transplantation may be
taken after death, so long as the procedure for obtaining the
necessary consent has not been completed.21
Respect for the donor
The question of preconditioning having ethical issues derives
from the observation that these manipulations will not
benefit the individual directly in any way. There is indirect
benefit, from the donor’s volition to donate organs for
transplantation being fulfilled, but is this enough?
Societal beneficence and justice require that the maximum
good be obtained from the gifted organs. This could also be
seen as an extension of autonomy (albeit posthumously),
where respect for the wishes of the deceased to be an organ
donor mandates that the transplant procedure be as effective
and beneficial as possible. Thus it could be argued that there
is a moral and ethical imperative to use preconditioning
strategies if they improve the use of donated organs.
Autonomy is difficult to establish once an individual has
died, but this may become easier as the use of advance
directives increases. As has been described in the debate on
elective ventilation, however, the lack of public knowledge
about specific treatments (such as elective ventilation) means
that any impact of advance directives is likely to be limited
(Price,15 p 189).
The act of joining an organ donor register or carrying a
donor card may be considered an indication of consent to
organ donation, but it is not clear whether such consent
would extend to preconditioning strategies. There is a need to
establish whether preconditioning can be seen as no different
from other medical interventions, such as the administration
of heparin to donors, and also whether consent to organ
donation implies consent to all techniques required to allow
good use of the organs. As stated above, justice and societal
beneficence require that the best possible use is made of the
organs, and therefore that all beneficial manipulations are
used.
It is conceivable, however, that the relative importance
ascribed to such considerations might alter depending on the
nature of the preconditioning strategy considered. It seems—
for example, unlikely that many relatives would object to the
deceased donor being given a drug to improve organ function
but it is possible that they might raise objection if it were
necessary to keep the donor ventilated for a prolonged period
of time to allow the drug to take effect. Similarly, more
interventional preconditioning techniques, such as whole
body hyperthermia,22 may be less acceptable to donor
families.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Non-heartbeating donation
In the controlled non-heartbeating donor, death is not
diagnosed until cessation of cardiac function. In this setting
interventions prior to death, either to optimise the donor or to
precondition organs, may alter the process leading to death

and this is considered unacceptable. The guidelines currently
being drawn up by the Intensive Care Society state quite
clearly that ‘‘It is inappropriate to escalate current treatment,
add new therapies—for example, inotropes, heparin, hor￾mone replacement, or to undertake invasive interventions—
for example, vascular cannulation before death for cold
perfusion, to improve organ viability’’.23 Preconditioning in
this setting is only potentially possible after the diagnosis of
death and an acceptable period (frequently 10 minutes)
during which no intervention is made on the potential donor.
In terms of practicality this means that only preconditioning
strategies that involve perfusion of the deceased donor or
involve ex vivo perfusion of organs would be acceptable in
this context.
Living donation
Living donors provide the simplest model, where the donor is
fully aware of the donor procedure and can provide detailed
consent, with prolonged time for consideration and reflec￾tion. This situation therefore poses few ethical considerations
not encompassed by fully informed consent. Although all
organs donated for transplantation are considered precious,
the act of living donation places additional responsibilities on
the medical profession. Living donation of organs or tissues is
one of the few circumstances in medicine where the donor
undergoes a procedure with no physical benefit to them￾selves. In this context it is imperative that the risk to the
donor is minimised. Similarly, because there is a risk to
the donor, however small, it is generally accepted that the
donated organ should have a reasonable chance of successful
transplantation. Considering these issues, any precondition￾ing strategy applied to a living donor population must not
only demonstrate benefit to the recipient but must also not
place any additional burden or risk on the donor.
Multiorgan donors
The majority of organ donors in the UK donate more than
one organ. This raises the question whether, if a precondi￾tioning strategy had been demonstrated to confer a beneficial
outcome for a particular organ, it would be acceptable to use
such a treatment in a multiorgan donor if the effects on other
organs were not known. The answer in this case would
probably be negative and so research involved in the
development of such strategies should consider effects on
other organs that might be donated simultaneously in a
clinical setting. If the effects of a treatment on other organs
were not adverse, the question would then arise as to
whether the potential recipients of other organs should be
consulted and requested to give their consent to precondi￾tioning being used. The issues of consent and collateral
involvement become more prescient in the context of a
clinical trial where the effect of a preconditioning strategy
may be the subject of evaluation.
Recipients of preconditioned organs
In many circumstances where preconditioning would be used
it may be impractical to obtain consent from the recipients in
time to influence the application of the preconditioning
intervention. There is concern therefore that if a recipient
objects to receiving an organ that has undergone precondi￾tioning this may subvert the normal informed consent
process by placing coercion on the recipient. Thus the desire
to receive a transplant may outweigh the concerns or
objections of the recipient to receiving an organ from a
research protocol. Adopting a utilitarian approach, it could be
argued that preconditioning has the potential to improve the
outcomes of transplantation and that society should support
research which aims to advance science or improve outcomes
in medicine. Following this argument to its practical
application, the occasional refusal to receive a preconditioned
organ would be offset by the perceived benefit to society as a
whole. In practice perhaps the easiest way to deal with this
issue would be to inform patients, at the time of addition to
the waiting list, that they may be offered organs derived from
trials of preconditioning protocols and that they should
consider whether they would accept such an organ. They
should also be informed that such protocols had received
approval from local regional ethics committees and that such
approval would not normally have been granted if there were
issues over either safety or perceived benefit.
Preconditioning in a research setting
In common with other medical research, trials of precondi￾tioning should abide by the principles enshrined within the
Declaration of Helsinki.24 Specifically there should be an
adequate laboratory and animal research base to support
human studies and these studies should have clear potential
for benefit counterbalanced against the inherent risk of the
intervention. The design of studies should be clearly set out
and be undertaken by competent individuals. Studies should
have been reviewed and approved by an independent
committee—in the UK this would be the local or multicentre
research ethics committee, as appropriate. Articles 10 and 11
of the Declaration of Helsinki deal with areas of research
where preconditioning could raise ethical issues. Article 10
relates to the situation where an individual may be in a
dependent relationship with the researcher, a possibility for
the recipient of an organ used in a preconditioning study, and
article 11 describes the case where the individual is legally
incompetent—the situation of the deceased donor. These
issues present specific problems for regional ethics commit￾tees, which often have to consider them without precedent
for comparison or using guidelines derived from research in
living subjects.
CONCLUSION
Preconditioning strategies have a great potential to improve
outcome in solid organ transplantation and also to increase
the availability of organs by allowing use of marginal donors.
As with many issues in transplantation, there are few
precedents to provide guidance on the practical implementa￾tion of such programmes. There are likely to be moves to
integrate these treatments into organ procurement protocols
in the near future. There is, therefore, a clear need to
establish an ethical consensus on the acceptability of such
treatments and the responsibilities of those involved in their
administration to donors, their families, and recipients. It is
hoped that transparency in such discussions will both pre￾empt misunderstandings arising from perceptions of unne￾cessary intervention or experimentation on the deceased
donor and provide an ethically acceptable framework upon
which preconditioning strategies could be based.
