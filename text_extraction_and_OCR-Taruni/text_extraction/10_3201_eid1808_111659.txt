Novel Hepatitis E 
Virus in Ferrets, 
the Netherlands
To the Editor: Hepatitis E virus 
(HEV), a member of the family 
Hepeviridae and the genus Hepevirus, 
is transmitted by the fecal–oral route 
and causes liver infl ammation, which 
leads to mortality rates of ≈20% 
in pregnant woman (1,2). Human 
hepatitis E is a major disease not 
only in developing countries but 
also in industrialized countries, and 
identifi cation of animal strains of 
HEV in pigs and deer and its zoonotic 
potential has raised considerable 
public health concerns (1,3). Recent 
reports suggest that other animals 
such as rats, mongooses, chickens, 
rabbits, and trout also may harbor 
HEVs (1–5). The genomes of these 
viruses are ≈6.6 kb–7.2 kb and encode 
3 open reading frames (ORFs) fl anked 
by a capped 5′ end and a poly A tail at 
the 3′ end (1,3). We used random PCR 
amplifi cation and high-throughput 
sequencing technology to investigate 
HEV sequences in ferrets (Mustela 
putorius) from the Netherlands.
In 2010, fecal samples were 
collected from ferrets in the 
Netherlands and stored at −80°C. 
Samples that were negative for 
ferret coronavirus (6) were further 
characterized for other pathogens. 
Viral RNA was isolated and 
viral metagenomic libraries were 
constructed for 454 pyrosequencing as 
described (7,8), and 248,840 sequence 
reads were generated from 7 fecal 
samples. Using Blastn and Blastx 
(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST), we 
identifi ed 289 sequence reads in 1 
sample that were related to rat HEV 
and that could be assembled into 6 
contigs covering ≈50% of the ferret 
HEV (FRHEV) genome.
We then developed a set of nested 
PCR primers on the basis of obtained 
sequences to detect viral RNA 
(online Technical Appendix Table 1, 
www.cdcnc.gov/EID/pdfs/11-1659-
Techapp.pdf). Total RNA extracted 
from 43 ferret fecal samples collected 
from 19 locations in the Netherlands 
was used to perform reverse 
transcription PCR amplifi cation. 
Using this PCR, we detected viral 
RNA in 4 (9.3%) fecal samples tested 
from 4 locations (distance between 
each sampling location ranged from 
25 km to 127 km). All amplicons were 
confi rmed by nucleotide sequencing. 
We have limited information regarding 
the clinical disease this virus may 
cause because these samples were 
obtained from household pet ferrets 
that did not show overt clinical signs. 
In addition, 4/16 animals from a 
single farm were IgG positive when 
tested for IgG against HEV by using 
recombinant human HEV protein 
(Wantai, Beijing, China).
To characterize the complete 
genome of this virus, we selected 2 
PCR-positive samples (FRHEV4 and 
FRHEV20), developed different sets 
of specifi c primers on the basis of 
sequence fragments obtained by 454 
pyrosequencing, directly sequenced 
amplicons by Sanger sequencing, and 
used a rapid amplifi cation of cDNA 
ends PCR to obtain 5′ and 3′ frame 
end sequences. Using overlapping 
fragments we assembled 2 complete 
FRHEV genome sequences that 
contained 6,854 nt, including a 13-
nt 3′ poly A tail and a 12-nt 5′ end. 
FRHEV full-genome sequences 
FRHEV4 and FRHEV20 showed 
98.6% sequence identity and were 
deposited into GenBank under 
accession nos. JN998606 and 
JN998607, respectively.
The FRHEV genome contains 
a complete ORF1 gene that encodes 
a nonstructural protein of 1,596 aa, 
an ORF2 gene that encodes a capsid 
protein of 654 aa, an ORF3 gene 
that encodes a phosphoprotein of 
108 aa, and a 3′ noncoding region of 
78 nt. Sequence analyses indicated 
that the FRHEV genome shared the 
highest identity (72.3%) with rat 
HEV. Sequence identity with HEV 
genotypes 1–4 and rabbit and avian 
HEVs ranged from 54.5% to 60.5% 
(online Technical Appendix Table 2).

Figure. Phylogenetic tree based on the complete genomic sequences of ferret hepatitis 
E viruses (HEVs) and human, rabbit, swine, avian, and rat HEV strains. Names of HEV 
strains follow GenBank accession numbers. Sequence alignment was performed by using 
ClustalW in the MEGA5.0 software package (www.megasoftware.net), and the trees 
were constructed by using the neighbor-joining method with p-distance (gap/missing data 
treatment; complete deletion) and 1,000 bootstrap replicates as in MEGA version 5.0.

was found to be slightly different 
from other HEVs and included a 
putative ORF (ORF4) of 552 nt 
that overlapped with ORF1 (online 
Technical Appendix Figure). A similar 
pattern of genome organization was 
observed for both FRHEVs.
Phylogenetic analysis of the 
complete genomes clearly showed 
that FRHEV was separated from 
genotype 1–4 HEVs and clustered 
with rat HEV (Figure). Similar 
phylogenetic clustering was observed 
when nucleotide and deduced amino 
acid sequences of ORF1, ORF2, and 
ORF3 were analyzed separately. The 
phylogenetic distance between rat 
HEV and FRHEV is larger than the 
distance between genotype 1 and 
genotype 2 HEV.
In recent years, an increasing 
number of sporadic cases of 
hepatitis E have been reported (1,9). 
Several observations suggest that 
autochthonous cases are caused by 
zoonotic spread of infection from 
wild or domestic animals (1,3,9). In 
addition, IgG anti-HEV seropositivity 
in the United States has been associated 
with several factors, including having 
a pet at home (10). Further studies 
are needed to identify the zoonotic 
potential of FRHEV.

Epidemic 
Clostridium 
diffi cile Ribotype 
027 in Chile 
To the Editor: The increased 
severity of Clostridium diffi cile
infection is primarily attributed to 
the appearance of an epidemic strain 
characterized as PCR ribotype 027 
(1). The only report that identifi ed 
epidemic C. diffi cile ribotype 027 
in an American country outside of 
North America comes from Costa 
Rica, raising the possibility that 
strains 027 might also be present in 
other countries of Latin America (2). 
Several studies between 2001 and 
2009 have been conducted in South 
American countries to detect the 
incidence of C. diffi cile infection in 
hospitalized patients, but they did not 
identify which C. diffi cile strains were 
causing these infections (3).
During an epidemiologic 
screening of patients with C. diffi cile
infection in a university hospital in 
Chile, we analyzed all stool samples 
of patients with suspected C. diffi cile
infection during a 5-month period 
(June–November 2011). Two cases of 
C. diffi cile infection were associated 
with ribotype 027.
