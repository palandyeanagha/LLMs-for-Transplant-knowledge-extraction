Abstract
Background: Cirrhotic patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) show extremely high
mortality rates. We have proposed the MBRS scoring system, which can be used for assessing patients on the day of
admission to the ICU; this new system involves determination of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and bilirubin level and
assessment of respiratory failure and sepsis. We had used this scoring system to analyze the prognosis of ICU cirrhotic
patients with AKI in 2008, and the current study was an external validation of this scoring system.
Methods: A total of 190 cirrhotic patients with AKI were admitted to the ICU between March 2008 and February 2011. We
prospectively analyzed and recorded the data for 31 demographic parameters and some clinical characteristic variables on
day 1 of admission to the ICU; these variables were considered as predictors of mortality.
Results: The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 73.2% (139/190), and the 6-month mortality rate was 83.2% (158/190).
Hepatitis B viral infection (43%) was observed to be the cause of liver disease in most of the patients. Multiple logistic
regression analysis indicated that the MBRS and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III (ACPACHE III) scores
determined on the first day of admission to the ICU were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality in patients. In the
analysis of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves, the MBRS scores showed good
discrimination (AUROC: 0.86360.032, p,0.001) in predicting in-hospital mortality.
Conclusion: On the basis of the results of this external validation, we conclude that the MBRS scoring system is a
reproducible, simple, easy-to-apply evaluation tool that can increase the prediction accuracy of short-term prognosis in
critically ill cirrhotic patients with AKI.

Introduction
Liver cirrhosis is characterized by disturbances in the systemic
circulation, including marked arterial vasodilation that occurs
principally in the splanchnic circulation, reduces the total
peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure, and causes a
secondary increase in the cardiac output. These abnormalities are
central to the development of several major complications in
patients with cirrhosis, such as the hepatorenal syndrome, ascites,
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, dilutional hyponatremia, and
hepatopulmonary syndrome. Renal failure is the most clinically
relevant condition among these conditions because its appearance
generally indicates a very poor prognosis [1–10].
We developed the MBRS scoring system, a simple prognostic
model that includes determination of mean arterial pressure
(MAP) and serum bilirubin level and assessment of acute
respiratory failure and sepsis. These 4 variables are to be analyzed
on day 1 of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). We used
this model to analyze and predict the in-hospital mortality in 111
critically ill cirrhotic patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) [11].
The MBRS score [calculated using the following predictors: MAP,
,80 mmHg; serum bilirubin level, .80 mmol/L (4.7 mg/dl);
acute respiratory failure, and sepsis] was defined as the sum of the
values of the individual predictors, each value ranging from 0 to 4.
This score has better discriminatory power than the other
evaluation systems such as the Child-Pugh [12], model for end￾stage liver disease (MELD) [13], Acute Physiology and Chronic
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 December 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 12 | e51094

Health Evaluation II and III (APACHE II & III) [14,15], and
sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) system [16]. The area
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values
for the MBRS scores were significantly more than the AUROC
values plotted for the Child-Pugh and APACHE II scores [11].
The prognostic value of MBRS scores for cirrhotic patients with
AKI admitted to ICUs needs to be validated further through
studies on different cohorts. Further confirmation is particularly
important because we observed that, over time, the mortality rates
of patients who showed the same characteristics at admission
typically decreased. Possible causes that may not have affected the
scoring variables, including improvements in therapies and
management of bleeding, renal failure, respiratory failure, and
sepsis, require additional testing in new study cohorts [2,17]. To
the best of our knowledge, no prospective clinical study has
validated predictive power of MBRS scores on critically ill
cirrhotics with AKI. We aimed to evaluate the reproducibility of
the MBRS scoring system in predicting the in-hospital mortality
rate by performing an external validation.
Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
This clinical study was conducted in full compliance with the
ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was consistent
with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and applicable local
regulatory requirements. The local institutional review board of
Chang Gung Memorial Hospital approved our study protocol.
Patients meeting the inclusion criteria were invited to participate
in this study on their first day of ICU admission. Trained
physicians evaluated their mental status during the screening and
informed consent procedure. Written informed consent was
obtained from all mentally competent patients or next-of-kin of
compromised ones prior to their participation.
Patient information and data collection
This study was performed between March 2008 and February
2011 in a 10-bed specialized ICU (hepatogastroenterology ICU) at
a 2000-bed tertiary care referral hospital in Taiwan. In this study,
we included 190 consecutive patients with hepatic cirrhosis and
AKI requiring intensive monitoring and/or treatment that cannot
be provided outside the ICU. We excluded patients who did not
match the criteria of AKI (127 patients), patients who had previous
end-stage renal disease patients undergoing regular renal replace￾ment therapy (38 patients); patients whose hospital stay length
,24 h (30 patients), patients who had received liver transplanta￾tion (16 patients), and patient who were readmitted (21 patients).
The following data were collected prospectively: demographic
data; reason for admission to the ICU; immediate diagnosis;
severity of the illness; MELD, SOFA, APACHE II, and APACHE
III scores determined on the first day of ICU admission; the
duration of hospitalization; and the treatment outcome. The
primary study outcome was the in-hospital mortality rate. Follow￾up examinations were performed 6 months after discharge of the
patients from the hospital by analyzing the chart records.
Definitions
Cirrhosis was diagnosed on the basis of the results of liver
histology or a combination of physical signs and symptoms and
findings from biochemical analysis and ultrasonography. Acute
kidney injury was defined as a 50% increase in serum creatinine
(SCr) level or an immediate requirement for renal replacement
therapy. The measurement of SCr levels was repeated following
the withdrawal of diuretics in the patients. A study stated that a
50% increase in SCr levels indicates acute renal dysfunction as per
the RIFLE (risk of renal failure, injury to the kidney, failure of
kidney function, loss of kidney function, and end-stage renal
failure) classification system. In that study, the patient had RIFLE￾R stage disease since the patient’s SCr level had increased by a
factor of 1.5 or more from the baseline [18]. Baseline SCr was the
first value measured during hospitalization. The modification of
diet in renal disease (MDRD) formula was used to estimate the
baseline SCr levels in 15 patients because these patients had been
admitted directly to the ICU and their previous SCr levels were
unknown [18]. Respiratory failure was defined as a respiratory
rate of #5/min or of $50/min, and/or requirement of
mechanical ventilation for $3 days, and/or fraction of inspired
oxygen (FiO2) of .0.4, and/or a positive end-expiratory pressure
of .5 cm H2O [19–21]. Sepsis was defined as systemic
inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) plus suspected or proven
infection. According to the guidelines of the American College of
Chest Physician/Society of Critical Care Medicine (ACCP/
SCCM) Consensus Conference, SIRS was defined as patients
with more than one of the following clinical findings: body
temperature, .38uC or ,36uC; heart rate, .90 beats per minute;
hyperventilation evidenced by a respiratory rate of .20 cycles per
minute or a Paco2 of ,32 mm Hg; and a white blood cell count of
.12,000 cells per mL or ,4,000 cells per mL [22].
The severity of the liver disease on admission to the ICU was
determined by using the Child–Pugh and MELD scoring systems.
Severity of the illness can also be assessed by using the SOFA,
APACHE II, and APACHE III scoring systems. The MBRS score
was based on 4 independent prognostic predictors: lower threshold
of MAP, i.e., 80 mmHg (1 point); upper threshold cut-off of serum
bilirubin, i.e., 80 mmol/L or 4.7 mg/dl (1 point); acute respiratory
failure (1 point); and sepsis (1 point). Assessment of these
predictors was performed on the day 1 of admission to the ICU
[11]. The worst physiological and biochemical values determined
on the first day of ICU admission were recorded. Clinical
management of these patients was done by the method described
elsewhere [11].
Clinical management
All patients received careful history taking, physical examination
and a number of laboratory measurements. Potential nephrotoxins
were discontinued. Renal ultrasound was arranged to exclude
postrenal azotemia on the first day of ICU admission.
Patients who had a clear history of septic or hypovolemic shock,
or a recent history of nephrotoxins exposure with high UNa
(.40 mEq/L), high FENa (2%), and urine osmolality under
350 mOsm/kg were treated as intrinsic azotemia as further
described. Patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding from
esophageal varices were initially treated with emergency sclero￾therapy and administration of vasopressors. Patients with peptic
ulcer, either with active bleeding, visible vessels or visible clots,
were treated with sclerosing agents, followed by proton pump
inhibitors. All patients received intravenous fluid depending on
their fluid volume and electrolyte status. The decision to transfuse
packed red blood cells (PRBC) was made according to the criteria
of the attending physician or whenever a patient’s hemoglobin
level dropped below 8 g/dL [23]. Patients with bacterial infections
on admission and patients who developed bacterial infections
during hospitalization were treated with appropriate empiric
antibiotic therapy according to culture results and the results of
appropriate diagnostic methods. When acute renal failure was
severe or progressive and measures to improve renal function had
been unsuccessful, renal replacement therapy was performed [4].

In all other patients, diuretics, lactulose, and vasodilators were
not given. Volume expansion therapy such as intravenous albumin
(1 g/Kg QD or BID, up to a maximum of 100 g) and/or artificial
plasma expanders were administrated to correct volume depletion
and to keep central venous pressure over 10 cmH2O every 12 hrs
for 2 days. Daily measurements of urine output and serum
creatinine began on day 1 of ICU admission and continued for at
least 2 days. Patients with volume-responsive serum creatinine
improvement was treated as prerenal azotemia and kept receiving
volume supply [4].
Patients without volume-responsive acute kidney injury who
had no shock, recent nephrotoxin exposure nor evidence of
parenchymal kidney disease history (by urinalysis and image) were
treated as hepatorenal syndrome with terlipressin (0.5–2 mg iv
every 4–6 hrs) plus albumin for at least 3 days. Others were
treated as intrinsic azotemia as described above [4].
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were expressed as mean and standard
deviation values unless otherwise stated. In the primary analysis,
we compared the number of hospital survivors with the number of
nonsurvivors. Normal distribution of all the variables was analyzed
using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Student’s t-test was used to
compare the mean values of continuous variables and normally
distributed data; in the case of the other data, the Mann–Whitney
U test was used. Categorical data were analyzed using the x2 test.
The chi-square test for trends were used to assess categorical data
associated with MBRS scores. Correlation of paired-group
variables were assessed using linear regression and Pearson
analysis. We assessed the risk factors for in-hospital mortality by
using univariate analysis, and the variables that were found to be
statistically significant (p,0.05) in the univariate analysis were
included in the multivariate analysis. A multiple logistic regression

model and forward elimination of data were used to analyze these
variables.
Calibration was assessed using the Hosmer–Lemeshow good￾ness-of-fit test to compare the number of observed deaths with the
number of predicted deaths in the risk groups for the entire range
of death probabilities. Discrimination was calculated using the
AUROC values. The AUROC values were compared using a
nonparametric approach. The AUROC analysis was also utilized
to calculate the cut-off values, sensitivity, specificity, and overall
correctness. Finally, cut-off points were calculated by calculating
the best Youden index (sensitivity+specificity21). Cumulative
survival curves as a function of time were plotted using the
Kaplan–Meier approach and were compared using the log rank
test. All the statistical tests were 2-tailed. A p value of ,0.05 was
considered statistically significant. The data were analyzed using
the Statistical Analysis for Social Sciences software, version 12.0
for Windows (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Subject characteristics
A total of 190 cirrhotic patients with AKI treated at the
specialized hepatogastroenterology ICU were enrolled in the study
between March 2008 and February 2011. The overall in-hospital
mortality rate for the entire group was 73.2% (139/190), and
the 6-month mortality rate was 83.2% (158/190). The
demographic data and clinical characteristics of both the
survivors and the nonsurvivors are listed in table 1. The median
age of the patients was 58 years; 141 patients were men (74%),
and 49 were women (26%). The median duration of stay in the
ICU was 9 days. The causes of cirrhosis, the reasons for
admission to the ICU, and presumptive etiologies of AKI are
listed in table 2. Hepatitis B viral infection was observed to the
cause of liver diseases in most of the patients. The most frequent
reason for admission to the ICU was upper gastrointestinal
bleeding. Patients who developed AKI tended to have a history
of infection.
Risk factors for in-hospital mortality
The univariate analysis showed that 12 (Table 3) of the 31
variables (Table 1) were good prognostic indicators. On
performing multivariate analysis, we identified that the MBRS
and APACHE III scores determined on admission to the ICU
have independent prognostic significance for assessing in￾hospital mortality (Table 3). Regression coefficients of these
variables were used to calculate the odds of death in each patient
as follows:

Severity of illness scoring systems
We have listed the results of goodness-of-fit as measured by the
Hosmer-Lemeshow x2 statistic denoting the predicted mortality
risk, the predictive accuracy of the Child-Pugh points, MBRS,
MELD, APACHE II, III, and SOFA scores in table 4. The
comparison between discriminatory values of the 7 scoring systems
has also been included in table 4. The AUROC analysis showed
that the MBRS score has the best discriminatory power. The
discriminatory powers of the RIFLE classification, Child-Pugh and
the APACHE II scores were significantly lower than that of the
MBRS score.
We examined the correlation between the scores determined by
the Child-Pugh points, MBRS, MELD, APACHE II, III, and
SOFA systems. The correlations between the scoring systems used
on the first day of admission of the patients to the ICU have been
listed in table 5. The MBRS score showed positive correlations
with other scores in terms of the likelihood of in-hospital mortality
(r.0.25, p,0.01) (Table 5).
To assess the validity of the applied scoring methods, the
sensitivity, specificity, and overall correctness of the prediction at
selected cut-off points that provided the best Youden index were
analyzed, and this data is listed in table 6. The MBRS score had
the best Youden index and the highest overall correctness of
prediction.
The patient number and the in-hospital mortality rate
calculated as per the stratification data of the MBRS scores has
been listed in table 7. The in-hospital mortality rate was 8%, 26%,
72%, 93%, and 97% for MBRS scores of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4,
respectively (x2 for trend, p,0.001). A progressive and significant
increase in the mortality rate was observed to correlate with the
increasing MBRS scores of the patients. With reference to an
MBRS score of 0, the odds ratios for different MBRS scores were
as follows: odds ratio for MBRS score of 1 = 3.85; odds ratio for
MBRS score of 2 = 28.286; odds ratio for MBRS score of
3 = 147.74; and odds ratio for MBRS score of 4 = 308. Cumulative
survival rates differed significantly (p,0.05) for patients with
MBRS score of 0 and patients with MBRS scores of 1, 2, 3, and 4.
The comparisons between patients with MBRS score of 1 and
those with MBRS scores of 2, 3, and 4 and between patients with
MBRS score of 2 and those with MBRS scores of 3, and 4 has
been depicted in Figure 1.
Discussion
In this study, the overall in-hospital mortality rate was 73.2%,
which is consistent with the findings of previous reports and
suggests that cirrhotic patients with AKI admitted to an ICU have
an extremely poor prognosis [11,24,25]. This investigation showed
that MBRS and APACHE III scores determined on the first day of

New Score in Cirrhosis with AKI

admission to the ICU are significantly associated with in-hospital
mortality in critically ill cirrhotic patients with AKI (Table 3). The
MBRS score showed better discriminatory power than the Child￾Pugh points, MELD, APACHE II, III, and SOFA scores (Table 4).
The MBRS score had the best Youden index and the highest
overall correctness of prediction (Table 6).
Our previous study showed the good discriminative power and
independent predictive value of the MBRS scoring system in
accurately predicting in-hospital mortality in critically ill cirrhotic
patients with AKI [11]. The results of this study confirm these
observations by showing that the MBRS score is a simple,
reproducible, and easy-to-apply evaluation tool and has good
prognostic value. This can help generate objective information for
patients’ families and physicians and supplement the judgments of
clinical prognosis. Patients with cirrhosis are known to exhibit
characteristic hyperdynamic circulation with secondary increase in
heart rate and cardiac output and decrease in systemic vascular
resistance, arterial blood pressure, and organ perfusion [26–28].
The fall in MAP resulted in glomerular blood flow decrease, and
there was an autoregulation mechanism for keeping perfusion
pressure which was achieved by pre-glomerular arteriole dilation
until the cut-off point of MAP in 80 mmHg [29]. It was thought
that MAP reflects not only the effective circulating volume caused
by splanchnic vasodilation but also the instability of the
hemodynamic system. Bilirubin level is a parameter reflecting
both severity of an underlying liver illness and a superimposed
liver injury caused by extrahepatic organ dysfunction [11].
Cirrhosis is associated with increased relative risk and death due
to acute respiratory failure. In addition, cirrhotic patients requiring
mechanical ventilation show an extremely poor prognosis [30].
Sepsis is a frequent cause of AKI and is associated with a poorer
prognosis than that due to other causes. Patients with cirrhosis are
susceptible to bacterial infections, which can lead to septic shock,
metabolic acidosis, renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy, and
decreased survival time [31]. The association of cirrhosis with such
abnormalities makes the MBRS score an excellent tool for
predicting in-hospital mortality in critically ill cirrhotic patients
with AKI. Since no extrahepatic parameters are included in the

determination of the Child-Pugh points, and no liver-specific
prognostic factors are included in the determination of the
APACHE II score, their discriminative powers are inferior to
that of the MBRS score (Table 4).
This investigation has shown that APACHE III is an
independent prognostic system for predicting in-hospital mortality
in critically ill cirrhotic patients with AKI. The APACHE III
system has been designed to increase the prediction accuracy of
mortality in critically ill patients. A continuous weighing scheme
for physiological variables, age, and comorbid conditions is used in
this scoring system. However, the number of variables in this
scoring system and their categorization has increased, and hence,
enhancements in the statistical power increases the complexity of
this system. Nevertheless, APACHE III is considered to be an
economical scoring system to predict the severity of a disease and
the probable mortality in patients [32].
In spite of the encouraging results observed in our study, several
potential limitations in the study should also be considered. First,
the study was conducted on patients from just 1 academic tertiary
care medical center, which limits the generalization of our
findings. Our results may be unsuitable for direct extrapolation
to other hospitals with different patient populations. Second, the
MBRS score is a specific scoring system developed only for
cirrhotic patients with AKI who need intensive care support and
not for the general ICU population. Third, we observed that
hepatitis B viral infection (43%) was the leading cause of liver

cirrhosis in patients and that a high proportion of patients had
hepatoma (31%). This means that our results cannot be applied to
the patients with liver disorders in North American and the
European countries because liver diseases in these regions are
largely because of hepatitis C viral infection or alcoholism. Fourth,
the prognostic instruments were applied on patients already
admitted to the specialized hepatogastroenterology ICU and were
not used as a preadmission screening test; this may have skewed
the results.
Fifth, defining baseline SCr as the first value measured during
hospitalization might obscure the severity or even the presence of
AKI. However, exactly true baseline SCr is not always available
for all patients in clinical practice. Under various uncontrolled
situation, choosing SCr established before admission as baseline
value might run the risk to introduce some other biases and reduce
the reproducibility of scoring systems. Due to above, many
previous large studies also use admission SCr as baseline value to
evaluate the impact of AKI on mortality in hospitalized patients
[10,25,33]. As a matter of fact, cirrhotic patients who have stable
renal function during hospitalization are thought to have a lower
mortality rate, and such a relative low risk group is not our study
target. Sixth, sequential measurement performed using these
scoring systems (for example, daily, weekly) may reflect the
dynamic aspects of the clinical diseases, and thus provide better
information about the mortality risk in patients. Finally, the
predictive accuracy of logistic regression models has its own
limitations.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this study showed the grave prognosis in critically
ill cirrhotic patient with AKI. The analytical data also showed that
the MBRS and APACHE III scoring systems were independent
predictors of short-term treatment outcome in critically ill patients.
We confirmed that the MBRS scorings system is an accurate,
simple, easy-to-apply, reproducible, and economical system
capable of providing an improved prediction of prognosis along
with objective information for clinical decision making for treating
a homogenous group of patients. On the basis of the observed
results, we feel that critically ill cirrhotic patients with AKI who
show high MBRS scores ($2 points) should be prioritized for liver
transplantation, if they are suitable candidates for undergoing a
surgery.
