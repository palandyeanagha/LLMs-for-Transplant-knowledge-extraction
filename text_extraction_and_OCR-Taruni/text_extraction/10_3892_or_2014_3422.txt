Abstract. Ginseng has become one of the most commonly 
used alternative herbal medicines, and its active compo￾nent, ginsenoside Rg1 has known pharmacological effects, 
including anticancer properties. However, the effects of 
ginsenoside Rg1 on metastasis have yet to be investigated. In 
this study, we demonstrated the ability of ginsenoside Rg1 to 
suppress phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced invasion 
and migration in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. MCF-7 cells were 
treated with ginsenoside Rg1 and incubated with or without 
PMA. The protein and mRNA expression of MMP-9 and 
MMP-2 was analyzed using Transwell and wound‑healing 
assays and western blotting. The results showed that suppres￾sion was associated with the reduced secretion of MMP-9, a 
key metastatic enzyme. MMP-9 levels were regulated tran￾scriptionally and correlated with the suppression of NF-κB 
phosphorylation and DNA binding activity. Conversely, 
ginsenoside Rg1 did not affect MMP-2 mRNA and TIMP-1 
mRNA levels, or the activation of AP-1, suggesting a speci￾ficity of pathway inhibition. Inhibition of NF‑κB activation by 
p65 small‑interfering RNA (siRNA) was shown to suppress 
PMA-induced cell invasion and migration. The siRNA 
studies also showed that PMA-induced MMP-9 expression is 
NF-κB-dependent. The results suggested that the anticancer 
properties of ginsenoside Rg1 may derive from its ability to 
inhibit invasion and migration, and that these processes are 
regulated in breast cancer cells through the NF-κB‑mediated 
regulation of MMP-9 expression.
Introduction
The invasion and metastasis of cancer cells are known to be 
primary causes of cancer progression (1). When tumor cells 
metastasize, a number of proteolytic enzymes contribute 
to the degradation of ECM components and the basement 
membrane (2,3). Metalloproteinases (MMPs) play an essen￾tial role in the process and promotion of tumor invasion and 
metastasis in many types of cancer (4).
Among the previously reported MMPs, MMP-9 and 
MMP-2 are key enzymes for degrading ECM and type IV 
collagen (5,6). MMP-9 correlates with malignant phenotypes 
in various types of cancer and can be activated by a variety 
of stimuli such as cytokines and phorbol myristate acetate 
(PMA) during varied pathological processes(7,8). The MMP-9 
promoter region contains one NF-κB and two AP-1 binding 
sites (9-11), which are absent in the MMP-2 promoter region. 
Therefore, the activation of MMP-9 in cancer progression may 
be derived in part from its modulation by AP-1 and NF-κB 
transcription factors in response to extracellular stimuli.
Ginseng has become one of the most commonly used 
alternative herbal medicines, and ginsenoside Rg1 is one of 
its most active and abundant components. Ginsenoside Rg1 
has pharmacological effects in the central nervous, cardio￾vascular, and immune systems, and also exerts anticancer 
properties (12-20). However, the effect of ginsenoside Rg1 on 
cancer metastasis remains to be investigated. In the present 
study, we demonstrated the effects of ginsenoside Rg1 on 
PMA-induced invasion and migration in breast cancer and 
examine the potential mechanism involved in these effects. 
Our results support a model by which ginsenoside Rg1 inhibits 
MMP-9 expression by suppressing NF-κB activation to inhibit 
PMA-induced invasion and migration in MCF-7 cells.

(SRB), trichloroacetic acid (TCA), acetic acid, anti-β-actin and 
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich 
(St. Louis, MO, USA). TRIzol and cell culture reagents were 
purchased from Invitrogen Life Technologies, (Carlsbad, CA, 
USA). Antibodies for phospho-p65, phospho-c-jun and MMP-9 
were obtained from Cell Signaling. Secondary antibodies for 
western blotting were obtained from Amersham Biosciences 
Corporation (Piscataway, NJ, USA). Other reagents were 
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich unless stated otherwise.
Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. Cytotoxicity was determined 
by the SRB assay. Cells were seeded into 96-well plates and 
exposed to different concentrations (50, 100, 200 and 400 µM) 
of ginsenoside Rg1. After 48 h of incubation, the cells were 
fixed with TCA for 1 h at 4˚C, air-dried, and then stained with 
0.4% SRB solution for 30 min at room temperature. After 
staining, the SRB solution was removed, and the cells were 
subsequently washed five times with 1% acetic acid. Then, 
10 mM Tris base solution (pH 10.5) was added to dissolve the 
protein-bound dye, and plates were incubated on a plate shaker 
for 10 min. The OD570 nm was determined using a 96-well 
plate reader (MRX; Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA, USA).
Western blotting. MCF-7 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and 
exposed to the indicated concentrations of ginsenoside Rg1 
with or without PMA. After treatment, the cells were harvested 
using lysis buffer (pH 7.4, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 
1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mM sodium pyro￾phosphate, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1:1,000 
protease inhibitors). Protein concentrations were determined 
by the BCA method. Total protein (25 µg) was then sepa￾rated using 8-12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide 
gels and transferred to nitrocellulose blotting membranes. 
The membranes were probed with monoclonal antibodies 
against MMP-9, MMP-2, TIMP-1 or β-actin (1:8,000), and 
immunopositive bands were visualized using the Amersham 
ECL™ Plus Western Blotting Detection kit (GE Healthcare, 
Piscataway, NJ, USA).
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) (21,22). Biotin 
3' end-labeled DNA probes containing the NF-κB consensus 
site: sense 3'-TCAACTCCCCTGAAAGGGTCCG-5' and 
antisense 5'-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3', were 
purchased from Invitrogen (Shanghai, China). EMSA was 
performed using the light shift chemiluminescent EMSA kit 
(Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Briefly, the nuclear proteins were 
incubated in 1X binding buffer, 50 ng/µl poly (dI•dC), 0.05% 
NP-40, 5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 2.5% glycerol and ddH2O 
for 20 min at room temperature in a total volume of 20 µl. 
The reaction mixture was separated on a 6% non-denaturing 
polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a positively charged 
nylon membrane. The membrane was cross-linked, and the 
biotin-labeled DNA was detected by chemiluminescence.
Wound-healing assay. MCF-7 cells were seeded in a 6-well 
plate and incubated until they reached 80% confluence. A 
200 µl pipette tip was used to create a wound, and the cells 
were washed twice with serum-free culture medium to remove 
floating cells and then replaced with fresh medium without 
serum. The cells were subjected to the indicated treatment for 
24 h, and cells migrating from the leading edge were photo￾graphed at 0 and 24 h.
Matrigel invasion assay. The invasion of MCF-7 cells was 
performed in a 24-well Transwell unit (8-µM pore size), 
which was coated with 1 mg/ml Matrigel matrix as previ￾ously described (23). Briefly, MCF-7 cells were placed on the 
Matrigel-coated Transwell (the upper compartment of the inva￾sion chamber) in the presence or absence of Rg1 and PMA. 
Conditioned medium (500 µl) was added to the lower compart￾ment of the invasion chamber. After incubation at 37˚C for 48 h, 
the cells that had invaded the lower surface of the membrane 
were fixed with methanol and stained with hematoxylin and 
eosin. Random fields were counted by light microscopy.
RNA extraction and reverse transcription polymerase chain 
reaction (RT-PCR). TRIzol reagent was used to extract total 
RNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. 
Complementary DNA (cDNA) was created from 1 µg RNA 
using standard procedures with avian myeloblastosis virus 
reverse transcriptase (Promega). For polymerase chain reac￾tion (PCR) quantification, 2 µl of cDNA was amplified in a 
20 µl standard PCR reaction. PCR was carried out by initial 
denaturation at 94˚C for 3 min; 36 cycles of 94˚C for 45 sec, 
55˚C for 45 sec, 72˚C for 45 sec; and a final extension for 
10 min at 72˚C, followed by termination at 4˚C. RT-PCR was 
performed using the following primer pairs (Invitrogen) for 
semi-quantitative assessment: sense 5'-TCCCTGGAGACC 
TGAGAA-3' and antisense 5'-CGGCAAGTCTTCCGA 
GTAGTT-3' for MMP-9; sense 5'-TGAGCTCCCGGAAAA 
GATTG-3' and antisense 5'-TCA GCAGCCTAGCCAGTCG-3' 
for MMP-2; sense 5'-GGGGCTTCA CCAAGACCTACAC-3' 
and antisense 5'-AAGAAAGATGGGAGTGGGAACA-3' for 
TIMP-1; sense 5'-CGTGGACATCCGCAAAGAC-3' and anti￾sense 5'-GCATTTGCGGTGGACGAT-3' for β-actin. β-actin 
transcript served as an internal control for standardising the 
quantity of input cDNA. The PCR products were separated by 
electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualised under UV 
light using a gel documentation system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, 
CA, USA).
Transient transfection and luciferase reporter assay. To 
determine promoter activity, MCF-7 cells were seeded in 
6-well plates. At 70-80% confluence, the cells were cotrans￾fected with pCMA-β-galactosidase plasmid along with 
pGL2-MMP-WT, pGL2-MMP-9-mAP-1-2 or pGL2-MMP￾9-mNF-κB. The transfected cells were subsequently treated 
with ginsenoside Rg1 and stimulated with PMA. Following 
incubation for 2 h, the cells were lysed and luciferase activity 
was measured using a luminometer (Luminoscan Ascent; 
Thermo Electon Co., Germany).
Zymography assay. Zymography was performed as previously 
described (23,24). Briefly, cells were incubated in serum-free 
RPMI-1640 and the supernatants were collected after incuba￾tion for 24 h. Conditioned media were collected, centrifuged 
and electrophoresed at 4˚C on 10% SDS-PAGE containing 
1 mg/ml gelatin. The gels were washed with 2.5% Triton X-100 
and then incubated at 37˚C for 24 h in a buffer containing 
5 mM CaCl2, 50 mM Tris-HCl and 1 µM ZnCl2. The gels were 

ONCOLOGY REPORTS 32: 1779-1786, 2014 1781
stained with 0.05%Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 for 30 min 
at room temperature. The gelatinolytic activity of MMP-9 was 
observed as a white zone in a dark blue field.
Transfection of siRNA. Human breast cancer MCF-7 cells 
were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA) and 
seeded at 2x105 cells/ml in 6‑well plates. The cell plates 
were grown to 50% confluency and transfected with double‑ 
stranded siRNA for NF‑κB p65 target sequence: (sense, 
5'‑CUUCCAAGUUCCUAUAGAAdTdT‑3' and antisense, 
3'‑dTdTGAAGGUUCAAGGAUAUCUU‑5') or with a siRNA 
non-specific control (Guangzhou RiboBio Co., Ltd., Guangzhou, 
China). Silencing was confirmed by western blotting and EMSA.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis between groups 
was performed using an unpaired Student's t-test with 
SigmaPlot 10.0 software (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA, 
USA). Data are presented as means ± SEM. P<0.05 was 
considered to indicate a statistically significant result.
Results
Ginsenoside Rg1 inhibits cell invasion and migration of 
MCF-7 cells. To observe the effect of ginsenoside Rg1 on cell 
viability in MCF-7 cells, the cells were treated with increasing 
concentrations of ginsenoside Rg1 (50-400 µM) for 48 h and 
then assessed by SRB assay. Ginsenoside Rg1 had no effect 
on cell viability up to a concentration of 400 µM. Thus, the 
non-cytotoxic concentrations of ginsenoside Rg1, from 50 to 
200 µM were used in subsequent experiments (Fig. 1A).
To investigate the effects of ginsenoside Rg1 on 
PMA-induced cell invasion and migration, Transwell and 
wound-healing assays were performed. The cells were 
pretreated with 50 nM PMA for 24 h and then exposed to 
ginsenoside Rg1 (50-200 µM) for 48 h. PMA significantly 
increased the invasion and migration of MCF-7 cells as 
compared with PMA-untreated control cells, while ginseno￾side Rg1 reversed this effect (Fig. 1B and C). These results 
suggested that ginsenoside Rg1 may constitute an effective 
inhibitor of the invasion and migration in MCF-7 cells.
Ginsenoside Rg1 suppresses MMP-9 secretion by inhibiting 
its protein and mRNA expression. MMP-9 and MMP-2 are 
important ECM-degrading enzymes that are involved in 
cancer invasion and metastasis (5-8). Zymography assay, 
western blotting and RT-PCR were used to determine the 
effects of ginsenoside Rg1 on PMA-induced MMP-9 activity, 
and the protein and mRNA expression (Fig. 2). The results 
showed that ginsenoside Rg1 suppressed PMA-induced 
MMP-9 activity in a dose-dependent manner, which may be 
explained by decreased levels of MMP-9 protein and mRNA. 
Ginsenoside Rg1 did not affect MMP-2 mRNA expression 
suggesting specificity for MMP-9. Since the activity of MMPs 
is regulated by the endogenous inhibitor TIMP-1, RT-PCR 
was used to determine the mRNA levels of TIMP-1. However, 
the mRNA levels of TIMP-1 were not significantly affected 
by ginsenoside Rg1 (Fig. 2C). This suggested that ginsenoside 
Rg1 suppressed PMA-induced MMP-9 secretion by affecting 
its transcription levels. However, the regulation of MMP-9 was 
not likely to occur at the level of regulation of TIMP-1 mRNA.

1782 li et al: Suppression of PMA-induced tumor cell invasion by ginsenoside Rg1
Ginsenoside Rg1 inhibits PMA-induced MMP-9 activity by 
blocking its promoter activity. AP-1 and NF-κB transcriptional 
elements in the MMP-9 promoter are important in the regulation 
of its expression. To investigate the effect of ginsenoside Rg1 
on PMA-induced MMP-9 promoter activity and the possible 
role of these elements, MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected 
with a wt-MMP-9 promoter luciferase reporter construct and 
reporter constructs with mutations in the AP-1 and NF-κB 
sites (MMP-9-mAP-1-2 or MMP-9-mNF-κB). The transcrip￾tional activity of the wt-MMP-9 promoter reporter gene was 
activated up to 14-fold in cells by PMA. However, ginsenoside 
Rg1 significantly decreased the PMA-induced transcriptional 
activity of the reporter gene (Fig. 3A). Consistent with this result, 
the cells that received MMP-9-mAP-1-2 also demonstrated 
abrogated PMA-induced MMP-9 activity with ginsenoside 
Rg1 treatment (Fig. 3B). In contrast to the wt-MMP-9 and 
MMP-9-mAP-1-2, when cells were transfected with reporter 
plasmid containing the MMP-9-mNF-κB promoter, the lucif￾erase activity of the cells induced by PMA was not affected 
by ginsenoside Rg1 (Fig. 3C). These results suggested that 
ginsenoside Rg1 inhibited PMA-induced MMP-9 activity by 
suppressing the transcriptional activity of NF-κB.
Ginsenoside Rg1 inhibits NF-κB activation induced by PMA. 
To investigate the effect of ginsenoside Rg1 on PMA-induced 
NF-κB and AP-1 activity, we performed EMSA using 
binding elements from the MMP-9 promoter. MCF-7 cells 
were pretreated with ginsenoside Rg1 for 48 h and then 
exposed to 50 nM PMA for 2 h. PMA caused a modest, yet 
reproducible enhancement of the DNA binding activity of 
NF-κB, whereas ginsenoside Rg1 suppressed this activity in 
a dose‑dependent manner (Fig. 4A, top panel). Conversely, 
although AP-1 was induced by PMA, ginsenoside Rg1 had no 
effect on PMA-induced AP-1 activity. These results suggested 
that ginsenoside Rg1 regulates the transcriptional activity of 
MMP-9 by inhibiting PMA-induced NF-κB, but not AP-1.
To confirm these results, the effect of ginsenoside Rg1 on 
the PMA-induced phosphorylation of p65, a major subunit 
of NF-κB; and c-jun, a major subunit of AP-1, were investi￾gated by western blotting. Consistent with the EMSA data, 
the two proteins were phosphorylated in response to PMA. 
Figure 3. Ginsenoside Rg1 inhibits PMA-induced MMP-9 activity by blocking 
the transcriptional activity. MCF-7 cells were transfected with (A) pGL2-
MMP-9wt or (B and C) pGL2-MMP-9-mAP-1-2 and pGL2‑MMP-9-mNF-κB 
reporter plasmids containing mutations in the AP-1 and NF-κB binding sites, 
respectively. The cells were treated with ginsenoside Rg1 (50‑200 µM) for 
48 h, followed by incubation with 50 nM PMA for 24 h, and the luciferase 
activities in the cell extracts were assessed. Results (means ± SEM of triplicate 
wells) are representative of three independent experiments; *

Furthermore, ginsenoside Rg1 suppressed the PMA-induced 
phosphorylation of p65 expression in a dose-dependent 
manner. However, it did not affect the phosphorylation of 
c-jun (Fig. 4B). These results are consistent with the possibility 
that NF-κB functions as a target of the inhibitory effects of 
ginsenoside Rg1 on MMP-9 expression.
P65 suppresses siRNA cell invasion and migration of MCF-7 
cells. To confirm that PMA-induced MMP-9 expression is 
NF-κB-dependent, p65 siRNA was used to block the activation 
of NF‑κB in the present study. MCF-7 cells were transfected 
with p65 siRNA for 48 h, followed by treatment with 50 nM 
PMA for 2 h. Western blotting and EMSA were used to inves￾tigate the expression of p-p65 and the activity of NF‑κB. The 
results of the western blotting showed that PMA enhanced the 
expression of p-p65, while p65 siRNA reversed this effect. 
Consistent with the downregulation of p-p65 expression, 
NF‑κB activation was shown by EMSA to be significantly 
inhibited by the siRNAs (Fig. 5A).
Transwell and wound-healing assays were subsequently 
performed to observe the effect of p65 siRNA on cell invasion 
and migration. The results demonstrated that PMA signifi￾cantly promoted the invasion and migration of MCF-7 cells. 
However, p65 siRNA suppressed PMA-induced cell invasion 
and migration relative to the siRNA-negative controls (Fig. 5).
P65 siRNA inhibits MMP-9 protein and mRNA expression by 
blocking its promoter activity. The above results have demon￾strated that ginsenoside Rg1 may suppress PMA-induced 
invasion and migration by inhibiting NF-κB-dependent 
MMP-9 expression. Thus, in the present study we detected the 
effect of p65 siRNA on the protein and mRNA expression of 
MMP-9. Results of western blotting and RT-PCR showed that 
p65 siRNA significantly inhibited the PMA-induced levels of 
MMP-9 protein and mRNA (Fig. 6). The effect of p65 siRNA 
on the promoter activity of MMP-9 was also investigated. 
MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with a wt-MMP-9 
promoter luciferase reporter construct and reporter constructs 
with mutations in the AP-1 and NF-κB sites (MMP-9-mAP-1-2 
or MMP-9-mNF-κB). Consistent with the effect of ginsen￾oside Rg1, the results showed that p65 siRNA significantly 
inhibited PMA-induced MMP-9 activity by suppressing the 
transcriptional activity of NF-κB, but had no effect on the 
transcriptional activity of AP-1 (Fig. 7). Thus, the siRNA 
studies showed that PMA-induced MMP-9 expression is 
NF-κB‑dependent. These results confirmed that ginsenoside 
Rg1 suppresses PMA-induced tumor cell invasion and migra￾tion by inhibiting NF-κB-dependent MMP-9 expression.
Discussion
In the present study, we have demonstrated that ginsenoside 
Rg1 effectively suppresses PMA-induced invasion and migra￾tion. Ginsenoside Rg1 inhibits MMP-9 secretion by inhibiting 
its protein and mRNA expression, and since MMP-9 is known 
to act as a key regulator of metastatic function, it is likely that 
the suppressive effects of ginsenoside Rg1 on invasion and 
metastasis are mediated through its inhibition of MMP-9. Our 
results also show that ginsenoside Rg1 inhibits PMA-induced 
NF-κB activation in a dose-dependent manner, which may 
explain the transcriptional effects on MMP-9 mRNA. The 
siRNA studies show that PMA-induced MMP-9 expression is 
NF-κB‑dependent. These results suggest that ginsenoside Rg1 
serves as a potential inhibitor in preventing the invasion and 
metastasis of human breast cancers.
Invasion and metastasis are fundamental properties 
of cancer cells, and their control is therefore an important

therapeutic goal. The identification of novel candidate agents 
that inhibit these processes is essential for preventing the 
progression of malignant tumors. In the present study, we inves￾tigated the effect of ginsenoside Rg1 on invasion and migration 
in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. PMA was used to induce cell 
invasion and migration based on its well-characterized role as 
a tumor promoter in chemical-induced carcinogenesis in many 
cancer cells, including hepatoma, colon, glioma and breast 
cancer cells (25-27). The Transwell and wound-healing assays 
demonstrated that PMA significantly induces invasion and 
migration in MCF-7 cells, while ginsenoside Rg1 suppresses 
these processes. These results suggest that ginsenoside Rg1 
constitutes an effective inhibitor of cancer cell progression.
The enhanced expression of MMP-9 and/or MMP-2 has 
been shown to be responsible for PMA-induced cell inva￾sion and migration (5-8). To investigate how ginsenoside

Rg1 suppresses PMA-induced cell invasion and migration, 
we assessed the effects of ginsenoside Rg1 on PMA-induced 
MMP-9 by western blotting and RT-PCR. Ginsenoside Rg1 
suppressed the PMA-induced MMP-9 protein and mRNA 
expression in a dose-dependent manner. However, ginsenoside 
Rg1 did not affect MMP-2 mRNA expression, suggesting 
a specificity of this response. The mRNA levels of TIMP-1 
were also not affected by ginsenoside Rg1, suggesting that the 
suppression of PMA-induced MMP-9 is not mediated through 
TIMP-1.
However, one potential pathway of the regulation of 
MMP-9 is suggested by the results of the EMSA and western 
blot analyses. The results show that ginsenoside Rg1 suppresses 
PMA-induced NF-κB DNA-binding activity and the phos￾phorylation of p65, a major component of NF-κB that is known 
to translocate to the nucleus following phosphorylation and 
transactivate the promoters of multiple cancer-related genes, 
including MMP-9. Conversely, AP-1 DNA-binding activity and 
the PMA-induced phosphorylation of its c-jun subunit were 
not inhibited by ginsenoside Rg1, suggesting that the effects 
of ginsenoside Rg1 are limited to NF-κB. PMA is known to 
enhance the expression of MMP-9 through one NF-κB and 
two AP-1 binding sites within its promoter region (9-11). In the 
present study, the mutational analysis of the minimal MMP-9 
promoter demonstrated a requirement for NF-κB, but not AP-1 
for the suppression by ginsenoside Rg1. The siRNA studies 
also verified that PMA-induced MMP-9 expression is NF-κB￾dependent. The above‑mentioned results suggest a potential 
model whereby ginsenoside Rg1 inhibits PMA-induced MMP-9 
activity through NF-κB to suppress breast cancer cell migra￾tion and invasion. Thus, ginsenoside Rg1 constitutes a potential 
antimetastatic and anti-invasive agent that may be useful in 
future clinical studies against cancer.

Figure 7. P65 siRNA inhibits PMA-induced MMP-9 activity by blocking 
the transcriptional activity. MCF-7 cells were transfected with (A) pGL2-
MMP‑9wt or (BandC) pGL2-MMP-9-mAP-1-2 and pGL2-MMP-9-mNF-κB 
reporter plasmids containing mutations in the AP-1 and NF-κB binding 
sites, respectively. Cells were transfected with p65 siRNA (siRNA, 100 nM) 
or an negative control (NC, 100 nM) for 48 h, followed by treatment with 
50 nM PMA for 24 h, and the luciferase activities in the cell extracts were 
assessed. Results (means ± SEM of triplicate wells) are representative of
