Abstract
Irradiation of whole blood and blood components before transfusion is currently the only accepted method to prevent
Transfusion-Associated Graft-Versus-Host-Disease (TA-GVHD). However, choosing the appropriate technique to determine
the dosimetric parameters associated with blood irradiation remains an issue. We propose a dosimetric system based on the
standard Fricke Xylenol Gel (FXG) dosimeter and an appropriate phantom. The modified dosimeter was previously
calibrated using a 60Co teletherapy unit and its validation was accomplished with a 137Cs blood irradiator. An ionization
chamber, standard FXG, radiochromic film and thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) were used as reference dosimeters to
determine the dose response and dose rate of the 60Co unit. The dose distributions in a blood irradiator were determined
with the modified FXG, the radiochromic film, and measurements by TLD dosimeters. A linear response for absorbed doses
up to 54 Gy was obtained with our system. Additionally, the dose rate uncertainties carried out with gel dosimetry were
lower than 5% and differences lower than 4% were noted when the absorbed dose responses were compared with
ionization chamber, film and TLDs.

Introduction
Transfusion-Associated Graft-Versus-Host Disease (TA￾GVHD) is a rare, but fatal potential complication that occurs
when viable donor T lymphocytes proliferate and engraft in
susceptible patients after transfusion [1–3]. At least three factors
appear to be directly related to the risk of TA-GVHD [4]: 1) the
susceptibility of the patient immune system to the engraftment, 2)
the degree of Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) similarity between
donor and recipient and 3) the number and viability of donor T
lymphocytes present in the transfused components.
According to the literature, cases of TA-GVHD have been
reported in severely immunocompromised patients, including
patients with congenital immunodeficiencies, in bone marrow
transplant recipients, as well as in cancer patients treated with
chemotherapy or radiotherapy [2,5–15]. This serious transfusion
associated adverse reaction has also been reported in presumed
immunocompetent patients who received blood from homozygous
donors with shared HLA haplotypes or from a family member
[16–35].
Although the minimum concentration of lymphocytes in the
donor blood that can initiate TA-GVHD is unknown, a number of
lymphocytes as low as 16104
/kg of the recipient weight may be
sufficient to cause TA-GVHD [36]. The referred report corrob￾orates with other works and indicates that even leukocyte-depleted
blood products can promote this reaction [37,38]. Because there is
no effective treatment for TA-GVHD [39,40], irradiation of whole
blood and blood components prior to transfusion is the only
proven method to prevent the reaction [41,42]. Ionizing radiation
breaks the DNA molecules of T lymphocytes and prevents an
immune response against the recipient [3,43,44].
Blood irradiation can be performed using commercial irradia￾tors specifically designed for this purpose, which are usually
located in blood banks. These dedicated blood irradiators use
radioactive isotopes such as 137Cs or 60Co, which emit gamma￾rays, or linear accelerators, which emit X-rays. Based on previous
data about the elimination of allogeneic reactivity using Mixed
Lymphocyte Culture analysis (MLC), at least 15 Gy was
recommended for irradiation of blood components [45,46].
However, at least three cases of TA-GVHD were reported in
patients who received blood irradiated with doses between 15 and
20 Gy [47–49]. More recently, studies on the radiosensitivity of T￾cells to gamma and X-rays, assessed by Limiting Dilution Analysis
(LDA), have shown that an absorbed dose of 25 Gy is necessary to
prevent TA-GVHD [28,44,50]. Under this exposure condition,
damages are minimal to granulocytes and anucleate cells as
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 June 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 6 | e65334

erythrocytes (RBCs) and platelets (PLTs). Thus, Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) [51] and the American Association of Blood
Banks (AABB) [52] specify a dose of 25 Gy at the middle plane of
the blood component. Similarly, the European and the British
guidelines state that a minimum dose should be 25 Gy and no
more than 50 Gy for each blood bag [53–56]. In order to meet
these requirements, a dosimetric system must determine 1) the
dose rate and the dose in the blood bags and 2) the spatial dose
distribution in the irradiated blood volume.
A Fricke dosimeter is a chemical dosimeter, first proposed in
1927 by Hugo Fricke and Sterne Morse [57] as an acidic
oxygenated ferrous sulphate solution. The absorbed dose is
inferred through the radiation induced oxidation process, in
which ferrous ions (Fe+2
) oxidize to ferric ones (Fe+3
) due to water
decomposition [58,59]. This dosimeter has been recommended by
the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) [60]
and the International Commission on Radiation Units and
Measurements (ICRU) [61] as an alternative clinical dosimeter
owing to its water-equivalent radiological characteristics and
achievable absoluteness.
At the end of the last century, many researchers proposed tissue￾equivalent dosimeters based on the original Fricke liquid solution,
some with gelatin and polymeric matrices instead of liquid. Gelatin
dosimetry has been studied since 1950’s [62,63], when the gel
molecular proprieties began to be studied after ionizing radiation
exposures. Some of these gelatins were used to prepare Fricke gel
dosimeters, becoming the first dosimetric system able to three￾dimensionally map the absorbed dose in a non-destructive and
non-invasive manner [64–66]. In fact, one of the most common
recipes to prepare this type of dosimeter adds porcine skin gelatin
and Xylenol Orange dye to the original solution. This dosimeter is
known as Fricke Xylenol Gel (FXG) and was proposed by Gillboy
et al in 2000 [67]. The FXG has a linear absorbance response for
doses from 0 up to 30240 Gy. It has advantages over the liquid
solution when spatial resolution and natural oxidation stability are
crucial. In addition, the FXG dosimeter allows quantitative and
qualitative analysis of the absorbed dose spatial distribution over
an irradiated volume [68,69] with various analysis techniques,
including UV/visible spectroscopy [67,70–75], magnetic reso￾nance [64–66,71,76–80], Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) [69,81–
90] and photoacoustics [91,92].
Because the standard FXG optical response saturates for
absorbed doses higher than 30240 Gy, we have developed a
modified recipe for the FXG dosimeter, which includes lowering
the pH, increasing the metal dye concentration and adding
sodium chloride to the solution. These modifications provide
linear responses for doses up to 50 Gy, as recommended by the
blood irradiation guidelines.
Materials and Methods
Irradiation Sources and Calibration
In this study, the standard FXG [67], TLDs (LiF-100, Harshaw
Chemical Co., Ohio, USA), radiochromic film (Gafchromic￾EBT2, International Specialty Products, New Jersey, USA) and
the modified FXG dosimeter were irradiated using one sealed
60Co source (effective energy of 1.25 MeV) from a cobalt
teletherapy unit (Theratron-780C, MDS Nordion, Ontario,
Canada). Calibration of the 60Co source was accomplished with
a calibrated clinical ionization chamber (Farmer-N30001, PTW,
Freiburg, Germany) and an electrometer (K35617EBS, Keithley
Instruments Inc., Ohio, USA), in accordance with the Interna￾tional Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) protocol recommendations
[93]. Also following this protocol, the standard FXG, TLDs and
film were calibrated in terms of absorbed dose in water and their
responses were compared with those obtained with the modified
FXG dosimeter. In this sense, the standard FXG, TLDs and film
were employed as reference dosimeters to validate the modified
FXG response for dosimetry of a gamma blood irradiator
(GammacellH 3000, Best Theratronics Ltd., Ontario, Canada).
This irradiator contained one sealed 137Cs source (effective energy
of 0.662 MeV) with nominal activity of 53.7 TBq (1,450 Ci), inside
of a steel-encased lead shield, able to deliver up to 5.0 Gy per
minute at the canister central plane, for default rotation rates
(approximately 30 cycles per minute). The blood irradiator
dosimetry setup consisted of two different radiation phantoms
proposed here.
Since blood and blood components are usually chilled or frozen,
standard and modified FXG dosimeters were used for different
irradiation temperatures, employing the 60Co teletherapy unit and
a water phantom, maintained at the desired temperature (3 and
2361uC were evaluated). FXG samples were located inside
1.061.064.5 cm3 acrylic cuvettes (PlastibrandTM, Sigma-Aldrich,
Missouri, USA), which were positioned 0.5 cm under the water
surface, in accordance with IAEA build-up procedures [93]. The
dosimeters were isolated from water by a thin PVC plastic film, in
order to avoid possible contamination.
FXG Dosimeter System
The modified FXG recipe was prepared considering
124.38 mM of porcine skin gelatin (270 Bloom, Gelnex, Santa
Catarina, Brazil), 0.63 mM of ferrous ammonium sulphate
hexahydrate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), 0.20 mM of Xylenol
Orange, XO, (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), 48.78 mM of
sulphuric acid (J.T. Baker, New Jersey, USA), 0.63 mM of sodium
chloride (Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA) and Milli-Q water
(Millipore, Massachusetts, USA). Owing to its convenient melting
point (40uC, approximately) and visible light transparency, porcine
skin gelatin was chosen as the matrix gel. Ferrous ammonium
sulphate is the crucial component of the FXG dosimeter because
its oxidation (transformation from Fe+2 ions to Fe+3 ones) is
proportional to the absorbed dose in the irradiated dosimeter.
These chemical changes produce a visible light spectral band due
to XO, a metal ion salt indicator, which bonds only to the Fe+3
ions. The FXG induced absorbance after a radiation exposure
allows the use of optical techniques, such as spectrophotometry
and the CCD system described here. In order to prevent
immediate aggregation between XO and naturally oxidized Fe+3
ions, sulphuric acid is necessary to reduce the solution pH. Sodium
chloride was added to the modified solution to minimize influences
from organic impurities and to increase the system reproducibility.
In this research, we studied solutions with pH between 1.0 and
2.5 and XO concentrations between 0.05 and 0.25 mM, in order
to reach an adequate FXG recipe for blood irradiation, which is
stated hereafter. Considering the modified FXG dosimeter and
100.0 ml of Milli-Q water, dissolve 5.0058 g of gelatin and
0.0037 g of sodium chloride in 75.0 ml of water. Heat the mixture
up to 45uC and continuously stir until a clear solution is obtained.
Then, dissolve 0.0152 g of XO in 26.0 ml of sulphuric acid and
add 12.5 ml of water to this solution. Finally, dissolve 0.0196 g of
ferrous ammonium sulphate hexahydrate in the remaining
12.5 ml of water and add the last two solutions to the warm
gelatin one. After thorough mixing, fill the appropriate cuvettes for
the desired application and cool to obtain a consistent gelatin.
Analysis depends on the fact that, after ionizing radiation
exposure, the XO molecules bond 1:1 with Fe+3 ions, which result
in dyed regions with Optical Densities (ODs) directly proportional
to the absorbed dose at every point in the volume. The pre- and

post-irradiation images were registered with a CCD image system
using a 24 mm focal length, a f/18 aperture and a shutter speed of
1/100 [86–90]. Later, both images were superimposed and the OD
variations were processed by a MATLABH (MathWorks, Massachu￾setts, USA) computational routine, considering the red and green
channels for the modified FXG and film, respectively. We used the
following expression:
OD(x,y)~log I0(x,y)
I(x,y)
 , ð1Þ
where OD(x,y) is the optical density of the pixel at (x, y), i.e., the OD
of the x
th line crossing the y
th column of the acquired image. The
quantities I0 (x,y) and I(x,y) are the color levels of the (x
th
, y
th) pixel
corresponding to the pre- and post-irradiation samples, respec￾tively. Thereby, it was possible to establish a relationship between
the absorbed dose and the generated OD for any radiochromic
dosimeters, such as FXG and film. Additionally, a spectropho￾tometer (UltrospecTM 6300, General Electric Co., Buckingham￾shire, England) was used to compare the absorbance responses
between the standard and the modified FXG dosimeters, selecting
the 585 nm spectral band and computing the quantity:
DA~A{A0, ð2Þ
in which DA is the absorbance difference between irradiated, A,
and non-irradiated, A0, samples.
Dosimetry of the Blood Irradiator
Two-dimensional maps, i.e., the absorbed dose spatial distribu￾tions, were determined considering a completely filled canister
with blood phantoms composed of water or appropriate plastic
materials, such as polystyrene or acrylic [41,45,94]. The dosim￾eters and their corresponding phantoms were positioned inside the
blood irradiator canister and irradiated for 1.0 minute. Analysis
used the mirrored middle plane dose distributions of the canister,
which were plotted as isodose curves.
A dedicated FXG phantom was constructed for the blood
irradiator dosimetry. In this phantom, the FXG dosimeter was
placed in a cubic cuvette (12.4619.461.0 cm3
), surrounded by
two semi-cylindrical cuvettes filled with water, as shown in
Figures 1A and B. These cuvettes were manufactured with
2.0 mm-thick walls for adequate 137Cs build-up purposes [95].
The phantom geometry was chosen to match that of the canister
and simultaneously allow acquisition of the absorbed dose
distributions in the central middle plane of the volume.
The same acrylic phantom employed with the FXG dosimeter
(Figure 1) was used to perform the blood irradiator dosimetry with
film. Thus, a 12.4619.4 cm2 film sheet was inserted between the
cubic and one of the semi-cylindrical water filled cuvettes. Film
determined absorbed dose distributions were evaluated consider￾ing the same parameters as those applied for FXG dosimetry, i.e.,
absorbed doses were determined by the Optical Density method
described earlier and mirrored isodose curves were used to
represent dose distributions at the central middle plane of the
phantom.
A cylindrical homogeneous clear polystyrene phantom was also
manufactured, with size and shape matching those of the canister,
to measure absorbed doses with TLDs. Clear polystyrene plaques
were cut in accordance with the canister dimensions and attached
face to face with screws of the same material. Absorbed doses
along the central plane of the phantom were measured using three
TLDs per cavity, diametrically distributed along some plates
(Figure 2). After aligning the plates, the TLD-loaded phantom was
positioned inside the blood irradiator canister and then irradiated
for 1.0 minute. TLDs were previously annealed according to the
manufacturer recommendations, i.e., 1 h at 400uC followed by
2 h at 100uC. Dose readings were obtained with a Harshaw reader

(2000-B/2000-C, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Massachusetts,
USA) and a cubic spline interpolation technique was used to
represent dose distribution along the central plane of the phantom.
Statistical Analysis
In our study, we considered ten replicated batches for each
delivered dose, which ranged from 0 up to 54 Gy. In order to
represent the results obtained here, statistical analyses were
performed considering averages and standard deviations. The
combined standard uncertainty was calculated according to the
method stated in the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in
Measurements [96] and in the ISO/EASTM Estimating Uncer￾tainty in Dosimetry for Radiation Processing [97].
Results
Calibration
Dosimetry of the 60Co beam was performed inside a water tank
with an ionization chamber using a 10610 cm2 field size, at 80 cm
source-to-dosimeter surface distance [93]. The ionization chamber
yielded a dose rate of 0.95 Gy per minute, with an uncertainty of
less than 3%. For the same irradiation setup, the dose rate
measurements were 0.94 Gy per minute with TLD, 0.93 Gy per
minute with film and 0.91 Gy per minute with the standard FXG,
all uncertainties lower than 5%. The dose rate measured with our
modified FXG was 0.97 Gy per minute, with an uncertainty of
4%.
Dose Response and Relative Sensitivity of the Modified
FXG Dosimeter
In a dark and temperature controlled (561uC) environment,
absorbances were found to fade exponentially with time after
irradiation for the standard FXG, while the modified dosimeter
showed no significant fading effects in the first 24 h (Figure 3).
After the first day of irradiation, the modified FXG dosimeter
showed a smooth linear fading, which persisted during five days of
storage.
Figure 4A presents the standard and the modified FXG
determined absorbed doses up to 54 Gy, using a spectrophotom￾eter to select the 585 nm absorbance band. The standard
dosimeter saturated for doses higher than 40 Gy, while our
modified FXG was linear through the full dose range, with linear
correlation coefficient (r2
) better than 0.995. An absorbed dose
resolution of 0.2 Gy was attained with this setup. Figure 4B
presents the OD responses for the CCD optical-based technique,
compared with those measured by the spectrophotometer. The
results are in agreement with those acquired by the previous
technique, i.e., the standard FXG dosimeter saturates for higher
absorbed doses, while the modified one is linear over the whole
range (r2= 0.997). For this analysis technique, a maximum
absorbed dose resolution of 0.5 Gy was attained.
The standard FXG dosimeter showed a sensitivity variation of
0.1360.01% per uC for the spectrophotometric data and of
0.2160.02% per uC for the CCD measurements. In contrast, for
the same temperature range, we observed no significant depen￾dencies for the modified FXG dosimeter.
Dosimetry of the Blood Irradiator Unit
The modified FXG and the film dosimeters were used in
combination with the water phantoms (Figure 1) and measured by
the OD method, while TLDs were used in combination with the
clear polystyrene phantom (Figure 2) and measured by the
Harshaw reader. The 137Cs blood irradiator central dose rates
measured with the modified FXG, film and TLDs dosimeters

resulted in 5.41, 5.49, and 5.41 Gy per minute, respectively. The
dose rate uncertainties associated with TLD and film dosimeters
were lower than 3.5%, while the modified FXG dosimeter
presented an uncertainty lower than 4.5%.
Figure 5 presents the dose distributions at the central middle
plane of the phantoms, in 10% step isodose curves and a color
scale. The modified FXG (Figure 5A), the film (Figure 5B) and the
TLDs (Figure 5C), show absorbed doses ranging from 74.263.7%
up to 138.364.4%, from 73.661.1% to 139.361.4% and from
77.760.9% to 137.962.8%, respectively.
Discussion
Ionization chambers present high accuracy (,3%) and are
employed as reference dosimeters by many protocols
[60,93,98,99]. For this reason, we used an ionization chamber
as a reference dosimeter to calibrate the modified FXG dosimeter
proposed here. According to the literature, film and LiF-100

dosimeters also present appropriate features for dosimetric
purposes [100–103]. For these reasons, we also selected these
dosimeters to validate the modified FXG dosimeter when the
blood irradiator was used. Although the standard FXG can also be
used for this purpose, saturation effects for doses higher than
40 Gy are the main limitations for its use for blood irradiation. As
seen in the calibration results, the dose and dose rate values
obtained by the modified FXG dosimeter and those obtained by
the ionization chamber were not significantly different. In the
same manner, the dose rate associated with the 137Cs blood
irradiator determined by the modified FXG dosimeter was not
significantly different than those obtained by the standard FXG,
film and TLD dosimeters.
FXG is a spectrophotometrically feasible gel matrix [67], which
allows optical-based techniques to be applied for data acquisition.
Beyond that, the FXG dosimeter response presents low depen￾dence for energies up to 1.25 MeV [104], which avoids the
correction factors necessary when this dependence is not
negligible. Additionally, the porcine skin gelatin preserves the
spatial absorbed dose distribution integrity of the irradiated sample
and reduces ions diffusion after exposure. Furthermore, this
gelatin is chosen as the gelling agent because it helps to maintain a
low FXG effective atomic number (3.35 at 1 MeV) [105] and an
adequate mass density (1.05 g per cm3
), which are similar to those
of whole blood (3.45 and 1.06 g per cm3
, respectively) [106,107].
Lastly, this gelatin also provides two important features, a
reasonable melting point (40uC, approximately), which facilitates
preparation, and lower costs than other polymers. For all these
reasons, we have developed this dosimeter to optimize its
sensitivity, stability and linearity in dose response over the entire
dose range used in blood irradiation, besides proposing an
appropriate phantom for dosimetric measurements.
According to our findings, we observed a well stabilized relation
between the FXG dose response and its pH (non-published data).
The pH controls the chemical equilibrium of water radiolysis and
consequently the rate associated with the production of free
radicals. A higher pH value (.2.0), i.e., more alkaline solution,
promotes premature Fe+2 oxidation, which leads to early
saturations of the FXG response (&30240 Gy) and reduction
on its linearity (r2
,0.985). In contrast, a lower pH (,1.8) seems to
decrease the free radicals production rate and to increase the
linear dose response range. This feature is desirable since it allows
determination of doses as high as 50 Gy, currently recommended
by the guidelines [51–56]. This low pH range also results in higher
values of linear correlation factors associated to the FXG response
(r2
.0.995), which allows one to acquire information from the
response-curve in an effortless way. However, for very low pH
values (,1.3), XO2Fe+3 can dissociate and data related to dose
may be lost. Porcine gelatin structure appeared not to be affected
by the pH values investigated (1.0 up to 2.5).
Another important issue concerning the FXG dosimeter is the
relation between the solution acidity and its sensitivity. Consid￾ering the pH range used here, we observed that the sensitivity
associated with the solution was maintained constant
(&0.070 Gy21
cm21
) for pH values higher than 2.0, while it
decreased when the pH was reduced. Due to oxygen atoms
dissolved in the FXG solution, ferrous ions, Fe+2
, are naturally
oxidized into ferric ones, Fe+3
, which diffuse through the solution.
Both effects can be reduced when the solution pH is lowered,
although they continue to occur with time. We observed that a pH
value of 1.6 presents reduced natural oxidation and diffusion
effects. For these reasons, we propose a FXG recipe with a pH
value of 1.6.
We noted that higher Xylenol Orange concentrations yielded
wide linear dose ranges and decreased diffusion effects. As stated
earlier, XO bond to Fe+3 ions in a 1:1 ratio. Although the standard
FXG recipe presents a ferrous concentration able to provide
responses for doses as high as 100 Gy, its XO concentration does
not obey the referred ratio. In fact, similar to the dosimeter pH,
the standard XO concentration also contributes to the FXG
saturation effects for doses at 30240 Gy. For a 0.20 mM XO
concentration, we obtained adequate linearity for doses up to
54 Gy and reported no significant sensitivity dependence. In this
sense, considering the FXG optical response and its corresponding
linearity, we propose a FXG recipe with a XO concentration of
0.20 mM.
Sodium chloride aims to control the radiolysis chain reaction,
which is initiated in the solution by ionizing radiation. This occurs
since Cl atoms prefer to oxidize ferrous ions rather than producing
peroxides that accelerate the radiolysis process. We observed
better FXG repeatability responses (,3.5%) for a 0.63 mM
sodium chloride concentration and lower fading effects when
compared to the standard FXG dosimeter. Adequate repeatability
and fading are important features for any dosimetric instrument
that is intended to provide reliable measurements in a quality
control program.
According to our study, the standard FXG response showed a
dependence on temperature of 0.1360.01% per uC, for 3 up to
2361uC, in agreement (,8%) with results available in literature
[108–110]. On the other hand, dependence on temperature
showed by the modified FXG dosimeter was not significant.
Therefore, the modified FXG is a preferred dosimeter when
longer times, such as those for teletherapy blood irradiations
(.30 min), are required.
Usually, FXG samples are analyzed at 585 nm in a spectro￾photometer. In this study, we used a CCD system in order to
better investigate the proprieties related to the FXG dosimeter.
The CCD system used in this study allowed us to use three
different primary reading channels, namely Red (R), Green (G)
and Blue (B). We observed that the red and the green channels
presented optimum readings for the FXG and film dosimeters,
respectively, when linearity was considered, allied with acceptable
sensitivity responses. According to the results obtained here, the
CCD resolution in dose was almost 50% lower than that of the
spectrophotometer one. However, the linearity responses for both
techniques were similar (r2= 0.995 for the spectrophotometer and
r
2= 0.997 for the CCD system). While the spectrophotometer is
recommended when a higher accuracy in dose is desirable, the
CCD system provided adequate linear responses for the FXG
dosimeters, as well as high spatial resolutions (,0.5 mm) [90],
being completely acceptable for blood dosimetry purposes.
Although blood irradiation has been suggested since 1970s
[111] and associated quality control for blood products is well
established among different agencies [51–53,55,56], limited
attention has been given to the dosimetric aspects of this practice.
Qualitatively, there are blood irradiation indicators, used routine￾ly, which only state whether or not the blood bag was irradiated.
Different quantitative dosimetric tools have been studied for blood
dosimetry in recent years: thermoluminescent dosimetry (TLD)

commercially available for blood irradiators dosimetry (DOSE￾MAPTM/Ashland Inc., Covington, Kentucky, USA). However,
data need to be mailed to the manufacturer for dosimetric results,
not at all desirable for quality control.
The blood dosimetric methods employed used phantoms made
of acrylic, water and clear polystyrene (Figures 1 and 2), easily
found materials. Simultaneously, they provide similar mass
attenuation coefficients to those of whole blood in the appropriate
radiation energy range (&2.0%; ,1.0% and ,2.5%, respectively)
[120], in accordance with ionizing radiation protocols [121].
Moreover, acrylic and clear polystyrene do not need highly
specialized equipment to be machined and are relatively
inexpensive. In fact, the proposed dosimetric phantoms can be
readily employed in any blood bank quality assurance program.
The isodose curves obtained with FXG, film and TLD
dosimeters were similar (Figure 5). The maximum difference in
dose observed among the dosimeters was 4%. Despite spatial
resolutions of these dosimeters are slightly different, those
differences are not relevant in comparison to the minimum and
maximum recommended doses. Although the TLD normalized
absorbed dose distribution was similar to the other dosimeters, its
spatial resolution was lower, because TLD dosimetry is commonly
accomplished through individual TLD dosimeters, meaning that
discrete readings need to be acquired and later interpolated. Each
dosimeter presented reasonable homogeneous regions at the
central irradiation area, due to continuous rotation of the canister,
and a highest isodose percentage values at the lower mid point of
the irradiated volume. Those dose values were presumed to be
related both to photon scattering and source alignment. Since the
canister top is without a cap, irradiations were not vertically
symmetric. However, the energy imparted by the 137Cs photons to
the phantom was relatively low (0.662 MeV) and indicates that
scattering was not the major contributor to the reported results.
Thus, data suggest that the 137Cs source or, at least, the
radioactive volume of the source may be misaligned from the
vertical center. Nevertheless, even if the available blood irradiator
presents a displaced source, the FXG, film and TLD percentage
dose distributions indicate that it is still able to irradiate blood at
acceptable homogeneity levels.
As recommended by different international guides [51–56],
blood is currently irradiated from 25 up to 50 Gy to prevent TA￾GVHD. According to our findings, the modified FXG dosimeter
provides feasible and linear responses for blood irradiation
applications in this absorbed dose range. In addition to dose rate
and dose distribution measurements, the proposed FXG dosimet￾ric system can be used by the blood bank staff for a quality
assurance method for blood irradiation. In summary, it has been
shown that the modified FXG dosimetric system proposed here
presents appropriate features for quality assurance control in the
clinical environment.
