Abstract Introduction
Early features in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis include
accumulation of oxidized LDL (oxLDL) and endothelial ex￾pression of the vascular adhesion molecule VCAM-1. Be￾cause antioxidants inhibit endothelial VCAM-1 expression,
we tested the hypothesis that oxLDL functions as a prooxi￾dant signal in atherogenesis to augment VCAM-1 activation
by inflammatory signals. Cultured human aortic endothelial
cells (HAECs) or human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVECs) were incubated with unmodified LDL, oxLDL,
or glycated LDL for 48 h. No change in VCAM-1, intercellu￾lar cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), or E-selectin expres￾sion from control was observed by ELISA. However, dose￾response and time course studies demonstrated that oxLDL
enhanced VCAM-1 expression induced by the cytokine tu￾mor necrosis factor a (TNFa) 63% in HAECs and 45%
in HUVECs over unmodified LDL or control. Using flow
cytometry analysis, oxLDL augmented TNFa-induced
VCAM-1 expression in a uniform HAEC population. oxLDL
had no effect on E-selectin induction. oxLDL augmented
TNFa-induced ICAM-1 expression 44% in HAECs but not
in HUVECs. Glycated LDL augmented TNFa-induced
VCAM-1 expression 35% in HAECs but not HUVECs. Simi￾lar results were obtained with 13-HPODE or lysophosphati￾dylcholine, significant components of oxLDL. 13-HPODE
augmented TNFa-induced mRNA accumulation and tran￾scriptional activation of VCAM-1 in HAECs. These results
suggest that as long-term regulatory signals, specific oxi￾dized fatty acid and phospholipid components of oxLDL
augment the ability of vascular endothelial cells to express
cytokine-mediated VCAM-1. These studies link oxidant sig￾nals conferred by oxLDL to oxidation-sensitive regulatory
mechanisms controlling the expression of endothelial cell
adhesion molecules involved in early atherosclerosis. (J.

Several lines of evidence point to the key role of inflammatory
processes in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (1-6). It has
been shown that endothelial cell activation, by cytokines and
other inflammatory mediators, results in the synthesis of binding
molecules and chemotactic factors and increases interactions
with leukocytes (7-11). Endothelial cells play a major role in
defining the types of leukocytes recruited, such as monocytes,
lymphocytes, or neutrophils, by selectively expressing specific
adhesion molecules, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1
(VCAM-1 ), intercellular adhesion molecule-I (ICAM-1), or
E-selectin, in response to various inflammatory stimuli (12-
14). The adhesion of leukocytes is believed to be based on a
cascade of molecular interactions and is mediated by multiple
cell adhesion molecules (10, 15).
Modulation of the expression and function of vascular genes
by oxidative signals may be an important mechanism through
which inflammatory signals initiate and propagate atherosclero￾sis. Endothelial expression of the cell surface adhesion molecule
VCAM-1 is an early, inducible event in experimental models
of atherogenesis preceding the accumulation of inflammatory
mononuclear leukocytes (16). Consistent with the notion that
oxidative stress plays an important role in atherogenesis, activa￾tion of endothelial VCAM-1 gene expression by diverse in￾flammatory signals occurs through an antioxidant-inhibitable
mechanism that involves a reduction-oxidation (redox) -sensi￾tive activation of an NF-KB-like transcription factor (13). This
mode of regulation distinguishes VCAM-1 from other inducible
adhesion molecules, such as ICAM-1 and E-selectin (13), and
suggests that VCAM-1 may represent a useful experimental
paradigm to explore the linkage between oxidative modulatory
signals and nuclear regulatory mechanisms in the vasculature.
Oxidatively modified LDL (oxLDL) has been implicated
as an important oxidative signal in the pathogenesis of athero￾sclerosis. oxLDL accumulates and is preferentially synthesized
at sites of the vascular wall predisposed to atherosclerosis (17,
18). Although its precise mechanism of formation is not known,
LDL may be modified through lipid peroxidation in the forma￾tion of fatty acid hydroperoxides (19, 20), resulting in novel
epitopes generated on oxLDL that are recognized by macro￾phage "scavenger" receptors (19). Though still controversial,
cellular lipoxygenases may mediate LDL oxidation in several

cell types: LDL treated with soybean lipoxygenase and phos￾pholipase A2 closely resembles oxLDL (21). It has also been
shown that there are higher levels of 15-lipoxygenase enzymatic
activity in atherosclerotic lesions of rabbit and human aorta than
in corresponding normal arteries (22, 23). Other modifications,
such as glycated LDL (the nonenzymatic binding of glucose to
LDL observed primarily in diabetes mellitus), may be predis￾posed to further oxidization (24). Recently, Richardson et al.
(25) have demonstrated that there is increased expression in
vivo of VCAM-1 and E-selectin by the aortic endothelium of
normolipemic and hyperlipemic diabetic rabbits, providing at
least a partial mechanism for the enhanced atherosclerosis asso￾ciated with diabetes mellitus (26, 27).
oxLDL exhibits a wide variety of potentially atherogenic
properties in vitro, including stimulation of monocyte migration
(28) and inhibition of endothelium-dependent vasodilatation
(29, 30). Although oxLDL itself does not appear to induce
adhesion molecule gene expression, at least one potential com￾ponent of the oxLDL complex, lyso-phosphatidylcholine (lyso￾PC), does acutely induce a transient expression of VCAM-1
and ICAM-1 in cultured human aortic endothelial cells (31).
Importantly, these studies have focused on the role of oxLDL
as an acute, primary regulatory signal controlling vascular cell
function and gene expression. Yet, it is likely that chronic expo￾sure of vascular cells to oxLDL is another important characteris￾tic of the atherogenic lesion. In this context, oxLDL may serve
to modulate the response of vascular endothelial cells to a wide
variety of acute, primary regulatory signals such as inflamma￾tory cytokines. The molecular mechanisms underlying either
the acute or the potentially chronic effects of oxLDL on vascular
gene expression are unknown.
We have tested the hypothesis that oxLDL, as well as spe￾cific fatty acid hydroperoxide and phospholipid components of
oxLDL, serves as an oxidative signal that selectively augments
redox-sensitive VCAM-1 gene expression in vascular endothe￾lial cell. These studies begin to address the role and molecular
mechanisms of action of specific oxidative signals in the sensiti￾zation of the vasculature to otherwise physiological signals that
may underlie the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.
Methods
Cell types used. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs),
purchased from Clonetics, Inc. (San Diego, CA) were cultured in Gibco
M199 medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY) supple￾mented with 15% FBS, 50 ag/ml endothelial cell growth supplement,
25 mM Hepes buffer, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and
100 U/ml streptomycin. Human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs), also
purchased from Clonetics, Inc., were cultured in M199 medium supple￾mented with 10 ng/ml endothelial cell growth supplement, 15% FBS,
10 Mg/ml hydrocortisone, and 2 mM L-glutamine. Cells were grown at
37°C on tissue culture plates and used for experimentation at no greater
than passage 8. HUVECs were grown on plates specially coated with
0.1 % gelatin.
Preparation of LDL Human LDL (d 1.019-1.063 g/ml) was iso￾lated from EDTA-treated plasma by density gradient centrifugation and
pooled; the solvent density was adjusted to 1.020 by a high density
salt solution containing KBr, NaCl, and EDTA. Ultracentrifugation was
performed for 18 h at 50,000 rpm in a 50.2 rotor. The supernatant was
collected and dialyzed extensively against isotonic saline and 0.5 mM
EDTA (32). The LDL supernatant was again ultracentrifuged for 18 h
at 50,000 rpm in a 50.2 rotor. The supernatant LDL was collected
and dialyzed extensively against isotonic saline and 0.5 mM EDTA.
Oxidation of LDL was performed by dialysis against EDTA-free iso￾tonic saline supplemented with 4 MM CuSO4 at 37°C for 18 h. Glycation
of LDL was performed by techniques described by Schleicher et al.
(33). All LDL preparations were stored in PBS. The extent of oxidation
of the LDL preparations was measured by the thiobarbituric acid reactiv￾ity assay as described previously (34). Malondialdehyde (MDA) was
used as a standard, and the thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances were
recorded as equivalents of MDA per mg of LDL protein. LDL protein
was calculated by the techniques of Lowry et al. (35). The degree of
oxidation of the LDL preparations was as follows: native LDL,
1.76±0.39; oxLDL, 35.51±5.23; and glycated LDL, 2.44±0.53 MDA
equivalents per mg of LDL protein. The degree of protein glycation of
the glycated LDL particle was determined by the fructosamine assay as
described previously (36). There was a 6.1-fold increase in glycation
products after extensive exposure to high concentrations of glucose in
vitro. The concentration of LPS for all LDL preparations was < 5 pg
per 100 /ug of LDL protein, as measured by the chromogenic Limulus
test (37).
Endothelial cell culture. HUVECs and HAECs in Ml99 were plated
in 96-well plates. The cells were then incubated at 37°C in a tissue
culture incubator containing 5.0% CO2 with their respective media con￾taining no LDL, or 100 ug/ml unmodified (native LDL), oxLDL, or
glycated LDL, for a 48-h period. Viability of the cells was determined
by microscopic evaluation and by trypan blue exclusion; the viability
of the cells was > 90% after a 48-h incubation period. The cells were
then exposed to tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa; 0-100 U/ml) and
incubated for 6 h. Human recombinant TNFa was obtained from Boeh￾ringer Mannheim Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN). The cells were then
removed from the tissue culture incubator and prepared for ELISA of
VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and E-selectin (see below).
Effect of hydroperoxide and lyso-PC formation on cell surface ex￾pression of adhesion molecules. HAECs in M199 medium were plated
in 96-well plates, as previously described. Linoleic acid, purchased from
Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI), was converted to linoleyl hydro￾peroxide (13-HPODE) via the addition of 15-lipoxygenase (17, 38).
Additionally, a preparation of 13-HPODE was purchased commercially
from Cayman Chemical. No appreciable differences in biological effects
were seen in these two separate preparations. The preparation was added
to HAECs (final concentration, 30 MM) and incubated for a 48-h period.
lyso-PC (50MM), purchased from Calbiochem-Behring Corp. (La Jolla,
CA), was added to HAECs for a 48-h period. The cells were then
exposed to TNFa at doses of 10, 25, 50, and 100 U/ml for a 6-h period
at 37°C. Cells were then removed from the tissue culture incubator and
prepared for ELISA of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and/or E-selectin cell sur￾face expression.
ELISA of cell adhesion molecule expression. HUVECs and HAECs
were plated on 96-well tissue culture plates. Primary antibodies in M199
medium with 5% FBS were added to each well and incubated for 30
min at 37°C. The cells were then washed and incubated for 30 min with
peroxidase conjugated with goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad Labora￾tories, Richmond, CA) diluted 1:500 in M199 medium with 5% FBS.
The wells were then washed, and the binding of antibody was detected
by the addition of 100 MI of 0.1 mg/ml 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine
(Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) with 0.003% hydrogen peroxide.
The reaction was stopped by the addition of 25 MI of 8 N sulfuric acid.
Plates were read on an ELISA reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules,
CA) at OD 450 nm after blanking on rows stained only with second
step antibody. All data points were performed at least in triplicate.
Fluorescence immunoassay. Confluent HAECs in 150-mm2 plates
were treated in M199 medium with 13-HPODE (30 iMM) and oxLDL
(100 Mg/ml) at 37°C for 48 h. HAECs were then treated or not with
TNFa (100 U/ml) for 6 h. At the end of the incubation, the cells were
washed with M199 medium and incubated on ice for 1 h with mAb
against human VCAM-1 (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL).
Subsequently, HAECs were washed three times with PBS and then
incubated on ice for 1 h with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody
(Southern Biotechnology). After washing four times with PBS, the cells
were lysed with 0.01% (wt/vol) NaOH, 0.1% SDS buffer for 30 min
at room temperature. The fluorescence of the cell lysate was determined
Oxidative Signals and Vascular Endothelial Function 1263

with emission maximum at 520 nm and excitation at 488 nm, using
a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA).
Specific cell surface mAb binding in this assay was calculated by sub￾tracting the fluorescence detected in endothelial cell monolayers incu￾bated in the absence of primary mAb (39).
Northern blot analysis. Total cellular RNA was isolated by a single
extraction using acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform
(40). Total cellular RNA (20 pg) was size fractionated using 1% agar￾ose-formaldehyde gels in the presence of 1 Mg/ml ethidium bromide.
Transfers of RNA and hybridizations were performed as described pre￾viously (13). After hybridization, filters were washed at a final strin￾gency of 0.2x SSC (lx is 150 mM NaCl, 15 mM sodium citrate) at
55°C. Autoradiography was performed with an intensifying screen at
-70°C. Laser densitometry and digital analysis of scanned images were
used for quantitation of autoradiograms.
Transcriptional analysis. Early passaged HAECs in 150-mm2 culture
dishes were treated with linoleic acid (30 ,M) or 13-HPODE (30 ,uM)
for 48 h and then exposed to TNFa (100 U/mi) for 3 h. Nuclei were
prepared, and transcriptional rates were determined by nuclear run-off
analysis as previously described (41). Briefly, nuclei were labeled with
10 mCi/ml [a-32P] UTP. The RNA was isolated and then hybridized to
filter-immobilized, denatured plasmids containing specific cDNA inserts
(10 Mg of DNA per slot) of VCAM-1 and /3-actin (plasmids were
obtained from B. Gopal, Otsuka America Pharmaceuticals, Bethesda,
MD). Imaging was performed using the PhosphorImager 445Si (Molec￾ular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and NIH Image 1.55 computer software
(Wayne Rasband, Bethesda, MD).
Statistics. Experiments involving cell surface expression of cell ad￾hesion molecules were performed (in triplicate) on five separate occa￾sions involving three different batches of LDL, and consistent results
were observed. HAECs were used at passages 3-8 during these experi￾ments, and no significant difference in the response to cytokine induction
of cell adhesion molecules was noted. Values presented are means
+standard error of measurement. Statistics were perfonned by using
an unpaired Student's t test. Significance was determined at the 95%
confidence level.
Results
oxLDL selectively augments TNFa induction of VCAM-J gene
expression in both arterial- and venous-derived vascular endo￾thelial cells. We have previously reported that antioxidants in￾hibit cytokine-mediated activation of VCAM-I gene expression
in cultured HUVECs (13). To determine whether oxLDL, a
naturally occurring oxidant associated with atherogenic lesions
(19, 23, 38), could have the opposite effect, both HUVECs and
early passaged HAECs were incubated for 48 h with either
unmodified LDL, oxLDL, or glycated LDL at 100 ,tg/ml. Gly￾cated LDL, a form of LDL found in diabetic patients, was
prepared according to standard procedures (see Methods) to
test whether other forms of modified LDL had properties similar
to or distinct from those of oxLDL. As shown in Fig. 1, preincu￾bation alone (closed boxes) with native LDL (lanes 3 and 11),
oxLDL (lanes 5 and 13), or glycated LDL (lanes 7 and 15)
had no significant effect on cell surface expression of VCAM￾1 (A and B), ICAM-1 (C and D), or E-selectin (E and F) in
either HUVECs (A, C, and E) or HAECs (B, D, and F). This
suggests that long-term exposure to either native or modified
LDLs has no significant effect on the basal cell surface expres￾sion of these adhesion molecules in unactivated vascular endo￾thelial cells.
Modified LDLs did effect a significant change in cytokine
induction of VCAM-1 gene expression in both HUVECs and
HAECs. As shown in Fig. 1, preincubation with native LDL at
100 ,ug/ml for 48 h (striped boxes, lanes 4 and 12) had no
effect on the ability of TNFa alone (6-h exposure; lanes 2 and
10) (100 U/ml) to induce VCAM-1, E-selectin, or ICAM-1
expression in either cell type. However, preincubation with
oxLDL augmented TNFa induction of VCAM-1 expression an
additional 45% (P < 0.05), (Fig. 1 A, lane 6) and 64% (P
< 0.05) (Fig. 1 B, lane 14) in both HUVECs and HAECs,
respectively. In contrast, oxLDL had no effect on TNFa induc￾tion of E-selectin expression in either cell type (Fig. 1 E and
F, lanes 6 and 14) or ICAM-l expression in HUVEs (C, lane 5).
oxLDL did augment TNFa activation of ICAM-1 expression in
HAECs by 36% (Fig. 1 D, lane 14). Glycated LDL augmented
TNFa activation of VCAM-1 expression in HAECs by 35% (P
< 0.05) (Fig. 1 B, lane 16) but not in HUVECs, nor did it
affect ICAM-1 or E-selectin expression in either cell type.
To explore further the augmentation of modified LDL on
VCAM-1 gene expression, control and preincubated HAECs
were exposed to TNFa (100 U/ml) for varying times up to 24
h and then assayed for cell surface VCAM-1 expression by
ELISA. As shown in Fig. 2, in both control and native LDL￾treated cells, VCAM-1 expression was transiently induced,
peaking at - 8 h and then gradually declining over 24 h. Prein￾cubation with either oxLDL or glycated LDL significantly aug￾mented TNFa-induced VCAM-1 during its peak expression be￾tween 4 and 12 h. No significant differences in expression were
observed at 24 h. This suggests that modified LDLs augment
cytokine activation of VCAM-1 gene expression in HAECs
without altering its characteristic transient pattem of induction
and deinduction.
13-HPODE and lyso-PC selectively augment TNFa activa￾tion of VCAM-1 cell surface protein expression in HAECs.
oxLDL is a complex structure consisting of at least several
chemically distinct oxidants (18, 19), each of which, alone
or in combination, might modulate cytokine-activated adhesion
molecule gene expression. Fatty acid hydroperoxides, such as
13-HPODE (derived from a polyunsaturated free fatty acid,
linoleic acid), are abundant componjents of oxLDL (23, 36)
and might serve as a specific redox signal in the expression of
cell adhesion molecules in endothelial cells. To determine
whether this chemically defined component of oxLDL alone
modulates adhesion molecule gene expression, HAECs were
preincubated for 48 h with linoleic acid (30 FLM) or 13-HPODE
(30 ,OM) at concentrations approximately equivalent to their
abundance in 100 ,g/ml oxLDL. As shown in Fig. 3, preincuba￾tion alone (closed boxes) with unmodified linoleic acid (lane
3), 13-HPODE (lane 5), or oxLDL (lane 7) had no effect on
cell surface expression of VCAM-1 (A), ICAM-1 (B), or E￾selectin (C), as determined by ELISA in HAECs. Preincubation
with linoleic acid had no effect of the ability of TNFa alone
(6-h exposure; Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 4) (100 U/ml) to induce
VCAM-1, E-selectin, or ICAM-1 expression. However, prein￾cubation with either 13-HPODE (Fig. 3, lane 6) or oxLDL
(lane 8) augmented TNFa activation of both VCAM-1 (A) by
71% and 65%, respectively, and ICAM-1 (B) by 80% and 43%,
respectively, but had no effect on E-selectin expression (C).
Under identical experimental conditions, using flow cytometry
analysis in HAECs, augmented expression of VCAM-I by both
oxLDL and 13-HPODE occurred uniformly throughout the cell
population rather than in a subpopulation of cells (Fig. 4, A￾D). This similarity between the effects of oxLDL and 13-
HPODE on adhesion molecule expression suggests that a fatty
acid hydroperoxide, such as 13-HPODE, may play an important

As shown in Fig. 5, 13-HPODE enhanced inducible VCAM￾1 (A) and ICAM-1 (B) gene expression over a wide range of
TNFa concentrations (10-100 U/ml) but had no effect on E￾selectin gene expression (C). This suggests that 13-HPODE

not only sensitizes HAECs to TNFa activation of these cell
adhesion molecules, but further augments their maximal
cytokine-inducible response. To establish whether other sig￾nificant components of oxLDL modulate cell adhesion molecule
expression in an analogous manner, parallel experiments were
performed with the phospholipid lyso-PC. Similar to 13-

HPODE, lyso-PC augmented TNFa-activated VCAM-l expres￾sion at lower TNFa concentrations (up to 25 U/ml) (Fig. 5 A)
and had no effect on E-selectin expression (C). However, in
contrast to 13-HPODE, lyso-PC had no effect on VCAM-1
expression at higher TNFa concentrations; nor did it augment
ICAM-1 expression. These results suggest that although 13-
HPODE and lyso-PC mediate distinct pattems of regulation of
cell adhesion molecule expression in HAECs, they share the
common feature of augmenting cytokine-activated VCAM-1
gene expression.
13-HPODE augments TNFa-induced VCAM-1 gene expres￾sion at the mRNA level. To explore whether the augmentation
of cytokine-induced VCAM-1 with 13-HPODE is observed at
the mRNA level, HAECs were incubated with linoleic acid or
13-HPODE and then exposed to TNFa (100 U/ml) for 4 h. As
shown in Fig. 6, 13-HPODE augmented VCAM-1 (A, lane 6)
mRNA accumulation induced by TNFa by - 75% compared
with TNFa alone (lane 4). Under similar conditions, no change
was observed in f6-actin (a constitutively expressed gene)
mRNA accumulation. No significant VCAM-1 mRNA accumu￾lation was observed in HAECs treated with linoleic acid (Fig.
6, lane 2) or 13-HPODE (lane 3) for a 48-h period. These
results suggest that pretranslational regulatory mechanisms may
mediate 13-HPODE augmentation of TNFa-induced VCAM-1
and ICAM-1 gene expression.
13-HPODE augments transcriptional activation of VCAM￾I gene expression. To determine whether 13-HPODE affects
transcriptional activation of VCAM-1 gene expression induced
by cytokine, nuclear run-off analyses were performed. HAECs
were incubated with linoleic acid (30 tM) or 13-HPODE (30
,qM) for 48 h and then exposed or not to TNFa (100 U/ml)
for 3 h. As demonstrated in Fig. 7, 13-HPODE augmented the
activation of transcription of VCAM-l induced by TNFa (lane
6) by - 55% compared with TNFa alone (lane 4). No changes

These findings are in agreement with the results observed with
Northern blot analyses measuring mRNA accumulation and
suggest that 13-HPODE further enhances the rate of transcrip￾tion of VCAM-1 induced by TNFa.

esis, might function at least in part through modulation of redox￾sensitive VCAM-1 gene expression. In this study, we have es￾tablished that long-term exposure to either oxLDL or the fatty
acid hydroperoxide (13-HPODE) and phospholipid (lyso-PC)
components of oxLDL augments the ability of vascular endothe￾lial cells from different vascular beds to express VCAM-1 in
response to a cytokine inflammatory signal. These findings sup￾port the notion that naturally occurring oxidant signals may
sensitize the vasculature to inflammatory signals through modu￾lation of endothelial adhesion molecule gene expression.
Oxidative modification of LDL is an important early event
in atherogenesis (18). Most studies have focused on the role
of oxLDL alone as a primary regulator of cellular function and
gene expression (17, 18), whereas little is known of the role
of oxLDL in modulating the response of endothelial cells to
other important factors resident in the atherosclerotic plaque,
such as cytokines (42). We have established that long-term
exposure to oxLDL (48 h) augments the ability of cultured
endothelial cells from two distinct vascular beds, HAECs (arte￾rial) and HUVECs (venous), to activate VCAM-1 gene expres￾sion in response to the cytokine TNFa. A similar effect was
observed for ICAM-1 in HAECs, but not HUVECs. Toxic re￾sponses were not visually observed in these studies, and the
ability of both cell types to induce E-selectin gene expression
under the identical experimental conditions was unaffected. In
the absence of cytokine, these same cells are indistinguishable
from control cells relative to adhesion molecule expression.
Indeed, basal expression of ICAM-1 characteristic of both cell
types was not markedly affected by oxLDL. These observations
argue that the effect of oxLDL on TNFa-mediated VCAM-1
adhesion molecule expression was specific, mediated neither by
a toxic response nor a general enhancement of TNFa-mediated
signals. Although the oxidative modification of LDL likely con￾fers the regulatory effect, possibly through a subsequent intra￾cellular redox-sensitive signal, we have not directly determined
whether oxLDL has a direct or indirect effect on the intracellular
redox state. It is possible that differences in uptake mechanisms
between modified and unmodified LDL could mediate a differ￾ential regulatory effect. Indeed, uptake through the scavenger

DNA per slot) of VCAM-1 and ,6-actin. After washes, filters were

receptor might mediate increased oxLDL uptake relative to un￾modified LDL uptake via the LDL receptor (20).
We also established that long-term exposure to another form
of modified LDL, glycated LDL, appears to function in a man￾ner analogous to oxLDL by augmenting cytokine activation of
endothelial cell VCAM-1 gene expression. Glycated LDL is a
modified form of LDL found in the serum of patients with
diabetes mellitus (24). Uptake and metabolism of the glycated
LDL particle by endothelial cells may be distinct from that of
oxLDL and may, through distinct, intracellular mechanisms,
modulate expression of cell surface VCAM-1. Nevertheless,
this observation suggests a possible functional link between
vascular inflammatory processes, atherosclerosis, and diabetes
mellitus. It may be that nonenzymatic glycation of proteins, by
its association with cytokines and/or endothelial cells, either
directly or indirectly induces the expression of genes encoding
these cell adhesion molecules (25).
The blood vessel origin of the endothelial cell appears to
play a role in the response to the modulatory effect of oxLDL
on adhesion molecule expression. Although oxLDL enhanced
cytokine activation of VCAM-1 expression in both HUVECs
and HAECs, ICAM-1 expression was similarly enhanced only
in HAECs. In addition, and although only semiquantitative,
there was a somewhat larger increase in VCAM-1 cell surface
expression induced by TNFa in HAECs compared with HU￾VECs when exposed to oxidized and glycated LDL. These dif￾ferences are not surprising, as considerable differences in func￾tional and regulatory properties characterize endothelial cells
derived from different vascular beds in culture, as well as intact
vessels in vivo (31). In our studies, this suggests that arterial￾derived endothelial cells such as HAECs may be more sensitive
to extracellular oxidative signals than venous-derived HUVECs.
Possible differences in the intrinsic redox properties of cell
growth and medium conditions could also play a role and are
currently being investigated. Additional factors, such as tissue￾specific transcriptional regulatory factors, may also be important

in regulating the extent of cell adhesion molecule gene expres￾sion.
A major outstanding issue concerning the role of oxLDL
in atherogenesis focuses on the nature of the active chemical
moiety(ies) that mediate its functional and regulatory proper￾ties. oxLDL is a complex molecule that contains several distinct
biochemical moieties, each of which has been implicated in
the atherosclerotic process (18-20). The chemical structure of
oxLDL generated within the vessel wall in vivo may not be
precisely replicated by the wide variety of in vitro modification
techniques used (43-45), thus complicating a comparison of
in vitro study results. Although their relative abundance may
vary greatly, fatty acid hydroperoxides (notably 13-HPODE)
and lyso-PC are consistently observed components of oxLDL
(23). We have established that oxLDL and its constituents 13-
HPODE and lyso-PC share the common property of augmenting
TNFa-activated VCAM-1 gene expression. However, two dis￾tinct patterns of regulation are apparent. First, both oxLDL and
13-HPODE enhance VCAM-1 expression at low (< 25 U/ml)
and high (> 50 U/ml) levels of TNFa stimulation, whereas
lyso-PC enhances expression only at low levels of TNFa. Thus,
lyso-PC sensitizes endothelial cells to TNFa regulatory signals
without altering the maximal TNFa response, whereas oxLDL
and 13-HPODE sensitize and augment maximal response. Sec￾ond, lyso-PC selectively augments VCAM-1 but not ICAM-1
expression, whereas oxLDL and 13-HPODE augment the ex￾pression of both genes in HAECs. These results suggest that
lyso-PC may play an important role in initiating VCAM-1-
mediated immune interactions in response to weak inflamma￾tory signals characteristic of the early atherogenic lesion.
oxLDL and 13-HPODE may not only contribute to this effect,
but may also augment VCAM-1- as well as ICAM-1-mediated
immune responses owing to the stronger inflammatory signals
found later in the maturing atherogenic lesion. Although the
underlying molecular mechanisms are not yet known, differ￾ences in the regulation of distinct signal transduction pathways
for lyso-PC (31, 46) and 13-HPODE (45, 47) and their interac￾tions with TNFa-mediated signals (1, 2) likely underlie this
regulatory effect.
Cellular lipoxygenases, such as 15-lipoxygenase, play a role
not only in the generation of oxLDL, but also in the generation
of intracellular fatty acid hydroperoxides (23, 45, 47). In the
context of VCAM-l expression, fatty acid peroxides may also
potentially serve as part of an intracellular, oxidation-sensitive
signal transduction system controlling VCAM-1 expression.
Through conversion of the major cellular reducing agent, gluta￾thione, to oxidized glutathione, fatty acid hydroperoxides are
normally detoxified by the enzyme, glutathione peroxidase
(48). Dithiocarbamates, such as diethyldithiocarbamate and
pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, act as inducers of glutathione per￾oxidase activity and prevent not only the decrease in glutathione
peroxidase activity, but also the decrease in reduced/oxidized
glutathione ratio observed in cells challenged with phorbol es￾ters (49). Through conversion of fatty acid hydroperoxides to
non-hydroperoxide-containing compounds, these antioxidants
may modulate VCAM-I gene expression. Although not directly
tested, our studies would suggest that the generation of a fatty
acid hydroperoxide, such as 13-HPODE, may serve as a second
messenger signal in cytokine-mediated VCAM-1 gene expres￾sion. A direct role for 13-HPODE on VCAM-1 transactivation
and NF-KB activation is now under study.
Our findings suggest that the degree to which 13-HPODE
and lyso-PC are generated within the LDL molecule may under￾lie some of the heterogeneity observed in some of the biological
effects of LDL modified by different in vitro oxidation tech￾niques (3, 31 ). For example, recent investigations have shown
that minimally modified LDL activates cultured endothelial
cells to increase their interaction with monocytes but not neutro￾phils (42, 49). In the same study, copper-oxidized LDL demon￾strated relatively minimal activity. Additionally, minimally
modified LDL stimulates production of monocyte chemotactic
protein-l in cells (49), whereas the effect of metal-oxidized
LDL is less pronounced (50). It is interesting that minimally
modified LDL is produced in vitro using soybean lipoxygenase
and phospholipase A2. It is possible that the 13-HPODE (syn￾thesized via lipoxygenase as well) that we used in our experi￾ments might function as a biologically active component of
minimally modified LDL when presented to the endothelial cell
in vivo.
In summary, our findings demonstrate that the ability of
endothelial cells to express specific cell surface adhesion mole￾cules in response to a cytokine signal may be modulated by a
naturally occurring oxidant signal, oxLDL, and its significant
components, 13-HPODE and lyso-PC. The molecular mecha￾nisms underlying the preferential response of VCAM-1, regard￾less of endothelial cell type, may be a function of its distinctive,
redox-sensitive mode of regulation ( 13). The mechanisms regu￾lating ICAM-l expression are less clear but may involve tissue￾specific factors, whereas E-selectin gene expression does not
appear to be modulated by these natural oxidants. As the type
of inflammatory response in vascular diseases such as athero￾sclerosis is defined at least in part by the types of cell adhesion
molecules expressed by activated endothelial cells, differential
regulation of these genes by oxidant signals may underlie the
characteristic pattern of inflammation observed in this disease
state.
