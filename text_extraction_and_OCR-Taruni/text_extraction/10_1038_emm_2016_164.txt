The identification of factors affecting the susceptibility to infectious diseases is essential toward reducing their burden on
the human population. The ABO blood type correlates with susceptibility to malaria and other infectious diseases. Due to the
structural similarity between blood antigen B and Galα1-3Galβ1-(3)4GlcNAc-R (α-Gal), we hypothesized that self-tolerance to
antigen B affects the immune response to α-Gal, which in turn affects the susceptibility to infectious diseases caused by
pathogens carrying α-Gal on their surface. Here we found that the incidence of malaria and tuberculosis, caused by pathogens
with α-Gal on their surface, positively correlates with the frequency of blood type B in endemic regions. However, the incidence
of dengue fever, caused by a pathogen without α-Gal, was not related to the frequency of blood type B in these populations.
Furthermore, the incidence of malaria and tuberculosis was negatively correlated with the anti-α-Gal antibody protective
response. These results have implications for disease control and prevention.

INTRODUCTION
The ABO histo-blood groups consist of two antigens (A and B),
and four blood types (A, B, AB and O), of which blood
types A, B and O are the most frequent among human
populations, with the O type being the most common.1 The
blood type O results from the homozygous inheritance of two
null ABO alleles and individuals in this group express the
antigen H, the precursor of blood types A and B1
. The ABH
antigens are carbohydrates attached to glycosphingolipids and
glycoproteins. In general, humans have antibodies against
missing A or B antigens.1 Therefore, individuals with blood
type A have antibodies against antigen B, but not against self￾antigen A2. Individuals with blood type O have antibodies
against both A and B antigens.2 The origin of anti-antigen
A antibodies is still controversial, but anti-antigen B anti￾bodies are associated with immunity to gut microbiota.3,4
The composition of blood groups is frequently used in
epidemiological studies because they constitute genetically
determined traits with polymorphic expression at the indivi￾dual and population levels.1 Blood-type differences have been
associated with susceptibility to and severity of malaria and
other diseases.1,5,6 For example, blood type O protects against
malaria through reduced rosetting.7 In contrast, individuals
with blood type A are more susceptible to severe malaria.8
Therefore, malaria has been recognized as a major evolutionary
pressure on blood type at the population level.1,5,7,8
The structure of antigen B (Galα1-3(Fucαl,2)Gal) is very
similar to Galα1-3Galβ1-(3)4GlcNAc-R (α-Gal). During evolu￾tion, humans lost the gene encoding the enzyme to synthesize
the carbohydrate α-Gal that resulted in an almost unique
capacity to produce high antibody titers against α-Gal.9 These
antibodies appear early in life10 and are continuously produced
in response to gut microbiota.3,11 However, individuals with
antigen B have a reduced antibody response against the related
antigens α-Gal and Galα1-3Gal.12,13 It was recently demon￾strated that anti-α-Gal antibodies inhibit Plasmodium spp.

transmission by Anopheles spp. mosquitoes, with a positive
correlation between the levels of anti-α-Gal IgM antibodies and
the incidence of P. falciparum infection.14 This finding suggests
that anti-α-Gal IgM antibodies might protect against infection
by Plasmodium spp. parasites and other pathogens containing
α-Gal on their surface.15,16 In contrast, anti-α-Gal IgE anti￾bodies may correlate with food allergies.17–19
These findings suggested the hypothesis that self-tolerance to
blood antigen B may affect the immune response to α-Gal,
with a major impact on the susceptibility to certain infectious
diseases and food allergies. If true, the incidence of infectious
diseases caused by pathogens with α-Gal on their surface
(for example, malaria and tuberculosis) should positively
correlate with the frequency of blood type B, while the
prevalence of diseases caused by pathogens without α-Gal
moieties (for example, dengue fever) and allergies related to
anti-α-Gal IgE antibodies (for example, allergy to red meat)
should not be correlated or should be negatively correlated
with the frequency of blood type B.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
ABO blood group frequency data collection and processing
The ABO blood group frequency data were collected from 132
manuscripts. The following criteria were applied to remove unreliable
or unnecessary information and to obtain reliable national estimates of
ABO blood group frequencies: (i) all studies that were focused on
disease group populations were excluded from the analysis as they
could bias the analysis. However, in studies that included control
(healthy) and target (disease) groups, the two sets of frequencies were
pooled and reported as a single value for that country; (ii) for the same
reason, all studies that focused on particular ethnic groups were
excluded. However, in studies where representative ethnic groups
from a country were included, the whole set of frequencies of each
blood group was pooled and reported as a single value for that
country; (iii) all studies that did not include all the ABO blood types
(A, B, O and AB) were excluded from the analysis; (iv) the studies in
which o50 individuals were analyzed were excluded. Only one study
was included with o100 individuals; (v) in addition, a rule was
applied to obtain more representative and accurate national ABO
blood type frequency reports. When more than one report per country
was found in the literature, an average ABO blood type frequency
from these studies was calculated and used as the country ABO blood
type frequency report.
The ABO blood group frequency data collection resulted in a
database obtained from 105 references for 82 countries from
Africa (N =26; 488 045 individuals), Asia (N =21; 44 709 411
individuals), America (N =15; 43 592 783 individuals), Europe
(N =18; 41 029 338 individuals) and Oceania (N =2; 42802 indi￾viduals). Data on ABO blood type frequency per country and a
complete list of references are available in Supplementary Table 1.
Disease data collection and processing
Data were collected for malaria and tuberculosis, caused by pathogens
containing α-Gal on their surface, and for dengue fever as a control
disease caused by a virus without α-Gal on its surface. The list of
malaria endemic countries was collected from Oxford’s Malaria Atlas
Project (MAP) website (http://www.map.ox.ac.uk).20 The list includes
100 countries from Africa, America and Asia. We attempted to include
most countries in the analysis. Particularly in Africa, MAP includes 44
malaria endemic countries for which incidence data were reported
from 2000 to 2015 (Supplementary Table 2).21 Incidence data for
Sudan were not available at MAP, and blood type frequency data were
not available for the 44 malaria endemic countries. Therefore, our
final data set for malaria in Africa was composed of 25 countries
(Supplementary Table 2). The number of deaths due to malaria in
Africa, Asia and America was collected from the World Malaria Report
2015 (Supplementary Table 3).22 Cumulative incidence per country
was calculated as the sum of all malaria incidences per year using MAP
data. The percentage reduction in malaria incidence was calculated as
the percent of cases that resulted from the comparison of the
incidence in 2000 vs 2015 using MAP data.
Data on the incidence of tuberculosis and dengue fever were
collected from Quandl23 and Bhatt et al.,
24 respectively. Bhatt et al.24
reported the apparent and unapparent mean dengue fever burden
estimates per country. For correlation analysis, we used the apparent
mean per country. Incidence data per country were then divided as
per the population of the country and multiplied by 100. Final
incidence values (expressed as a percentage) for tuberculosis and
dengue fever are available in Supplementary Table 4.
Statistical analysis of the correlation between blood type
frequency and disease incidence/prevalence
Statistical correlation was evaluated using the non-parametric Spear￾man test. One-way analysis of variance was used to test the statistical
significance of the distribution of ABO blood type frequencies per
region. All statistical analyses were performed using the GraphPad 6
Prism program (GraphPad Prism v6, GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla,
CA, USA). Differences were considered significant when P-value
o0.05 using the one-tail test.
Ethics statement
Serum samples from malaria patients were obtained under a protocol
approved by the National Ethics Committee of the Ministry of Health
of Senegal (October 2008; 0084/MSP/DS/CNRS, ClinicalTrials.gov ID:
NCT01545115). Serum samples from tuberculosis patients were
collected in the context of a previous study and approved by the
Ethics Board of the Hospital de S. João, Porto, Portugal.25 Oral and
written informed consents were obtained from the adult individuals,
or from the parents or legal guardians of the children.
Serum samples
Serum samples from malaria patients during the chronic disease phase
and uninfected healthy individuals were obtained from children in
Northern Senegal (Podor District) as previously reported.26 The area is
located in a dry savannah with a dry season from November to June
and a short rainy season from July to October.26,27 In this region,
malaria due to P. falciparum shows a low and seasonal incidence,
where peaks of infections appear after the rainy season.28 Anopheles
gambiae s.l. is the major malaria vector in the Podor District.26,28
Samples were collected from the Niandane village in the month of
January 2009, after the rainy season when a peak of malaria
transmission by An. gambiae s.l. was recorded.26 Samples from
infected (N =22) and uninfected (N =26) children were included in
the study (Supplementary Table 5). Serum samples from patients with
untreated pulmonary tuberculosis or during the first week of treat￾ment (N =41) and uninfected healthy individuals (N =43) were
obtained from adults in the Iberian Peninsula (Portugal and Spain)
(Supplementary Table 6).

Experimental & Molecular Medicine

Determination of anti-α-Gal IgG, IgM and IgE antibody
titers
Anti-α-Gal IgG, IgM and IgE antibody titers were determined in
serum samples from malaria and tuberculosis patients and uninfected
individuals. ELISA plates were coated with 100 μl per well (100 ng) of
Galα1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc-Human serum albumin (HSA; Carbosynth
Ltd, Berkshire, UK) in carbonate/bicarbonate buffer and incubated
overnight at 4 °C. Then, 100 μl of blocking buffer (1% HSA in
phosphate-buffered saline, PBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20,
PBST; Sigma-Aldrich, Madrid, Spain) was added to each well and
incubated for 1 h at room temperature (RT) followed by five washes
with PBST. The sera were added to plates at 1:50 dilution in blocking
buffer and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by five washes
with PBST. Goat anti-human immunoglobulins-peroxidase IgG
(FC specific), IgM (μ-chain specific) or IgE (ɛ-chain specific; Sigma￾Aldrich) were added at 1:1000 dilution in blocking buffer (100 μl per
well), and plates incubated for 1 h at RT. Plates were then washed five
times with PBST, and color was developed by the addition of 100 μl of
3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Promega Biotech, Madrid, Spain) and
protected from the light for 20 min at RT. Reactions were stopped
with the addition of 50 μl sulfuric acid, and the optical densities (OD)
were measured at 450 nm with an ELISA reader. The average value of
the blanks (wells without Gala1-3Galb1-4GicNAc-HSA coating; N =4)
was subtracted from all reads, and the average of two replicates for
each sample was used for analysis (Supplementary Tables 5 and 6).
A standard curve was constructed with sera from selected patients
and controls for anti-α-Gal IgE antibody levels determined by ELISA
and using the ImmunoCAP Phadia 250 automated platform (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Uppsala, Sweden) with the commercial ImmunoCap
α-Gal bovine Thyroglobulin kit according to the manufacturer
instructions. This experiment provided support for the binding of
anti-α-Gal IgE antibodies to α-Gal and allowed us to set the ELISA
cutoff for anti-α-Gal IgE positivity at OD450 nm of 0.3.
Statistical analysis of the anti-α-Gal antibody titers between
infected and uninfected individuals
Outliers in values for antibody titers were identified using the ROUT
method implemented in GraphPad 6 Prism program (GraphPad
Prism v6, GraphPad Software Inc.). Identified outliers corresponded
to malaria IgM (samples ID 8, 9, 11, 29, 44 and 46), IgG (samples ID
24, 30, 31, 44 and 46), and tuberculosis IgM (samples ID 23, 41, 27c
and 40c). Outliers were removed from the final data sets for analysis
using the nonparametric Mann–Whitney U-test to compare values
between infected and uninfected groups (P=0.05).
Bacterial strains and growth conditions
Mycobacterium marinum CECT 7091 reference strain (Colección
Española de Cultivos Tipo, Valencia, Spain) was grown in sterile
250 ml flasks with 7H9 liquid medium supplemented with ADC
(Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and incubated at 31 °C
with continuous shaking for 7 days in the dark. Spectrophotometric
absorbance was measured at 600 nm (OD600) and the concentration
was adjusted to 108–109 CFU ml − 1. The Escherichia coli O86:B7
(ATCC 12701) and BL21 (DE3; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
strains were included as positive and negative controls for α-Gal,
respectively,14 inoculated into 50 ml of Luria Broth (LB), and
incubated at 37 °C overnight.
Detection of α-Gal in bacterial cultures
The E. coli O86:B7, E. coli BL21 (DE3) and M. marinum cell cultures
were washed 2 × in PBS (4000 g, 5 min) and re-suspended in PBS.
Bacteria were fixed in 200 μl 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min
at RT and washed once in PBS. To visualize α-Gal, 108
–109 CFU ml − 1
were stained with 200 μl of BS-I Isolectin B4 (BSI-IB4-FITC), which is
a lectin-specific for α-Gal from Bandeiraea simplicifolia14 (50 μg ml − 1)
(Sigma-Aldrich; http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/content/dam/sigma￾aldrich/docs/Sigma/Product_Information_Sheet/2/l2895pis.pdf), for
2 h at RT and then analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScalibur
Flow Cytometer, equipped with the CellQuest Pro software
(BD Biosciences, Loveton Circle, MD, USA). The viable cell popula￾tion was gated according to forward scatter and side scatter para￾meters. Ten microliters of the fixed and stained samples were also used
for immunofluorescence assays after air-drying and mounting in
ProLong Antifade reagent containing DAPI (Molecular Probes,
Eugene, OR, USA). Images were acquired on a Nikon Eclipse Ti-U
microscope with a × 60 objective and a Nikon Digital Sight DS Vi1
camera.
RESULTS
Malaria incidence positively correlates with the frequency of
blood type B
To address this hypothesis, we collected data on the incidence
of malaria, a disease affecting 200 million people yearly and
caused by Plasmodium spp. parasites,29 and the frequency of
blood types A, B, O and AB in countries from Africa, Asia,
Europe and America to perform correlation analyses
(Supplementary Table 1). Blood-type B is present in o20%
of the population in all countries from America and Europe,
while this blood type is highly prevalent in malaria endemic
countries from Africa and Asia (Figure 1a and Supplementary
Figure 1). The frequency of blood-type B was negatively
correlated with the frequency of blood-type A in Africa, Asia
and Europe, but not in America (Supplementary Figure 2).
Using the malaria incidence spanning from 2000 to 2015
(Supplementary Table 2), we observed that African countries
with the highest incidence of malaria have the minimum and
maximum frequencies of blood types A and B, respectively
(Figures 1b and 2a). The number of deaths due to malaria in
Africa in 2014 (Supplementary Table 3) was also positively
correlated with the frequency of blood-type B, but not the
frequency of blood type A (Figure 2b). Malaria incidence
decreased in Africa from 2000 to 2015,21 a result that correlated
with a reduction in the frequency of blood type B (Figure 2c).
However, no correlation was found between the frequencies of
blood types O or AB and malaria incidence (Supplementary
Figure 3).
These results demonstrated that malaria incidence positively
correlates with the frequency of blood type B.
Tuberculosis, but not dengue fever, incidences positively
correlate with the frequency of blood type B
To test the hypothesis for other infectious diseases, tuberculosis
and dengue fever were selected based on their incidence30,31

Figure 1 ABO blood types and malaria incidence. (a) Frequency of ABO blood types in Africa, Asia, America and Europe. Information on
the distribution of blood types A (cyan), B (magenta), O (white) and AB (black) in 82 countries was collected from the literature
(Supplementary Table 1). Significant differences were observed between continents for the same blood type (one-way ANOVA test;
Po0.0001) and between blood types within the same continent (one-way ANOVA test; Po0.0001). (b) Cumulative (2000–2015) malaria
incidence in African countries was compared with blood type frequency. A negative correlation was observed between the frequency of
blood-type A (Supplementary Table 1) and malaria incidence (Spearman r=− 0.52, P=0.003), while the correlation was positive between
the frequency of blood-type B and malaria incidence (Spearman r=0.58, P=0.001). No significant correlation was found between the
frequency of blood types O (Spearman r=0.05, P=0.39) or AB (Spearman r=0.07, P=0.35) and malaria incidence. The countries with
the highest malaria incidence have the lowest and highest values for the frequencies of blood types A (minimum value, MIN 18%) and B
(maximum value, MAX 33%) in the population, respectively. The countries with the lowest malaria incidence have the highest and lowest
values for the frequencies of blood types A (MAX 37%) and B (MIN 12%) in the population, respectively.

transmitted by Aedes spp. mosquitoes, respectively). Data were
collected from countries in Africa, Asia, America and Europe
(Supplementary Table 4). As shown for malaria, a positive
and negative correlation was observed between tuberculosis
incidence and the frequencies of blood types B and A,
respectively (Figure 2d and Supplementary Figure 4A).
However, no correlation was found between blood type and
dengue fever incidence (Figure 2e and Supplementary
Figure 4B).
The incidence of malaria and tuberculosis, caused by
pathogens with α-Gal on their surface, negatively correlates
with the anti-α-Gal antibody protective response
The presence of α-Gal on the surface of Plasmodium spp.
parasites have been demonstrated and relate to the effect of
anti-α-Gal antibodies on P. falciparum infection.14 The α-Gal
epitope has also been found on the surface of Leishmania
spp. and Trypanosoma spp. parasites,16 bacteria of the gut
microbiota,32 and other pathogenic bacteria such as
mycobacteria (Figure 3a), but not in viruses. Furthermore,
preliminary experimental evidence with P. falciparum-infected
and uninfected individuals from Senegal, and M. tuberculosis￾infected and -uninfected individuals from the Iberian Peninsula
showed that the levels of anti-α-Gal IgM and IgG, but not IgE
antibodies, were significantly higher in uninfected than infected
individuals (Figure 3b; Supplementary Tables 5 and 6),
providing support for the negative correlation between the
incidence of these infectious diseases and the anti-α-Gal IgM
and IgG antibody protective response.
DISCUSSION
According to our hypothesis, the high frequency of blood
antigen B is associated with reduced immune response to α￾Gal, thus resulting in higher susceptibility to infectious diseases
caused by pathogens with α-Gal on their surface and a lower
prevalence of food allergies such as red meat allergy that are
related to anti-α-Gal IgE antibodies.

immunofluorescence showing the presence of α-Gal on the surface of mycobacteria (Mycobacterium marinum CECT 7091 reference strain).
Escherichia coli O86:B7 (ATCC 12701) and BL21 (DE3) strains were included as positive and negative controls for α-Gal, respectively. For
flow cytometry, cells were stained with BSI-IB4-FITC to visualize α-Gal and the viable cell population was gated according to forward
scatter and side scatter parameters. Ten microliters of the fixed and stained samples were also used for immunofluorescence assays after
air-drying and mounted in ProLong Antifade reagent containing DAPI. Representative immunofluorescence images are shown for bacterial
cells stained with BSI-IB4-FITC (anti-α-Gal-FITC, green; blue, DAPI). (b) Anti-α-Gal antibody titers in patients with malaria or tuberculosis
and healthy individuals. The levels of anti-α-Gal IgM and IgG antibodies were significantly higher in P. falciparum uninfected (Pf− ) vs
infected (Pf+) individuals from Senegal. A similar pattern was observed in M. tuberculosis uninfected (Mt− ) vs infected (Mt+) individuals
from the Iberian Peninsula. The levels of anti-α-Gal IgE antibodies were lower in both Mt+ and Pf+ patients, when compared with Mt−
and Pf − healthy individuals, respectively. The nonparametric Mann–Whitney U-test was used to compare values between infected and
uninfected groups (P=0.05).
Blood type and incidence of infectious diseases

Galili et al.33 suggested that individuals with blood types B or
AB would be tolerogenic to the fucosylated α-Gal epitope
present in antigen B. Nevertheless, all healthy individuals are
able to produce antibodies against α-Gal regardless of the blood
type.33–35 However, recent results have shown that the levels of
anti-α-Gal antibodies are lower in individuals with blood
antigen B.12,36,37 Furthermore, the anaphylaxis to red meat
consumption is associated to the presence of anti-α-Gal
IgE antibodies in affected patients17–19 with low antigen B
frequency.12
Together, these results support our hypothesis that the
presence of the blood antigen B correlates with increased
susceptibility to malaria and other infectious diseases caused by
pathogens carrying α-Gal on their surface. The antigenic
similarity12 and possible cross-reactivity between the antigen
B and α-Gal probably limits the production of anti-α-Gal
antibodies due to self-tolerance to antigen B2. This tolerance
may affect the production of anti-α-Gal antibodies generated in
response to gut microbiota and arthropod vector saliva-derived
proteins.14,15 The presence of the blood antigen A may favor
the production of not only anti-α-Gal but also anti-antigen
B antibodies, which may cross-react with α-Gal epitopes on the
surface of Plasmodium spp. and other pathogens. In fact, anti-B
antigen antibodies in individuals with blood types A and O are
primarily due to anti-α-Gal antibodies capable of recognizing
both α-Gal and antigen B epitopes.12
These results have important implications for the control
and treatment of infectious diseases. The higher anti-α-Gal
antibody response in individuals with blood type A may
facilitate and increase the immunity against pathogen infection
resulting in enhanced protection against disease. Retargeting
pre-existing anti-α-Gal antibodies to pathogens with an alpha￾Gal-conjugated aptamer could be developed as a novel thera￾peutic approach.38 In addition, the recent finding that
increased abundance of α-Gal producing bacteria, Lactobacillus
and Bifidobacterium in the gut microbiota affects Plasmodium
infection in mice.39 This opens the possibility of using
probiotics as potential interventions to reduce disease severity,
which may also be conditioned by blood type in humans.40
