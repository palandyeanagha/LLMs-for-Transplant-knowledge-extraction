Abstract. Background/Aim: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs) have revolutionized the treatment of cancers.
Sorafenib, an oral multi-target TKI, improves the median
overall survival time in patients with hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC). It also inhibits the absorption of carnitine
by down-regulating the human organic cationic transporter
OCTN2 located largely in the small intestinal mucosa and
skeletal muscle. The aim of the study was to determine, by
assessing carnitine metabolism, whether sarcopenia is
induced in patients with HCC who are receiving sorafenib.
Patients and Methods: This retrospective study included 110
adult Japanese patients with liver cirrhosis and HCC who
received sorafenib. Sorafenib was administered at a dose of
200-800 mg/day for 4 weeks. Blood samples were collected
before and after treatment, and serum carnitine fraction and
myostatin levels were measured. Cross-sectional areas (cm2)
of the skeletal muscles at the third lumbar vertebra level
were determined by manually outlining computed
tomography images before and after treatment. The cross￾sectional areas were normalized for height [skeletal muscle
index (SMI), cm2/m2]. Results: Patients were allocated to
two groups according to Child-Pugh (CP) class; 81 had CP￾A liver function, and 29 had CP-B. SMI after treatment was
significantly lower than that before treatment in both groups.
Serum levels of total carnitine and free carnitine after
treatment were significantly lower than those before
treatment in both groups. There were no differences in serum
levels of myostatin before and after treatment in either
group. Conclusion: Sorafenib might decrease serum levels of
carnitine by inhibiting carnitine absorption. Decreasing of
serum levels of carnitine might lead to presarcopenia.
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have revolutionized cancer
treatment. One TKI, sorafenib, is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor
that improves the survival time of patients with hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC). In the Sorafenib HCC Assessment
Randomized Protocol (SHARP) study, 602 mainly European
patients with Child-Pugh (CP) class A liver function and an
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of
0-2 received sorafenib or placebo. The median overall survival
time of the sorafenib group was 10.7 months versus 7.9
months for the placebo group (1). Sorafenib also demonstrated
a significant clinical activity against HCC in phase II and III
studies (2, 3), with sorafenib-treated patients having a longer
median survival time and longer time to radiological
progression than placebo-treated patients.
Sarcopenia is common in patients with liver cirrhosis (LC),
with an estimated prevalence of 40-70%, and worsened
survival, quality of life, and outcome after liver transplantation
in patients with LC (4-6). The impact of sarcopenia on clinical
outcomes has attracted much scientific attention in the fields
of different malignancies. Individualized nutritional
assessment and intervention strategies may be recommended
for patients with HCC and sarcopenia treated with sorafenib
(7-9). Sarcopenia may also be an indicator of poor clinical
course in patients with HCC receiving sorafenib (10) and, in
patients with advanced HCC and CP-A liver function,
sarcopenia predicts the occurrence of dose limiting toxicities
within the first month of sorafenib therapy (11).
Carnitine (β-hydroxy-γ-N-trimethylaminobutyric acid) is
widely found in foods from animals, and humans obtain 75%
of carnitine from diet (12). Carnitine plays a central role in
the transport of long-chain fatty acids from the cytosol to the
mitochondrial matrix. Carnitine binds to long-chain acyl￾coenzyme A and converts it to acylcarnitine, which is
transported to mitochondria and degraded by β-oxidation
(13). Thus, carnitine deficiency causes lipid metabolism
dysfunction, resulting in hepatic steatosis, skeletal myopathy,
and cardiomyopathy (14, 15). LC is classified into secondary
carnitine deficiency (16). Carnitine is retained in the body
by a mechanism that involves resorption of filtered carnitine
in the kidney by active transport across the tubular epithelial

cell membrane (17). This process is mediated by the human
organic cationic transporter OCTN2 (hOCTN2), a sodium￾dependent, high-afinity carnitine carrier. Sorafenib reportedly
inhibits OCTN2 function by approximately 24% (18).
The aim of the present retrospective study was to clarify
whether sorafenib affects serum levels of carnitine and whether
it induces sarcopenia in patients with LC and advanced HCC.
Patients and Methods
Patients. Between 2009 and 2017, a total of 110 adult Japanese
patients with LC received sorafenib therapy for advanced HCC at our
hospital. Sorafenib was administered daily for 4 weeks at a dose of
200-800 mg/day, depending on the patient’s body size and age. Data
for this study were obtained from blood samples collected early in the
morning before and after 4 weeks of sorafenib treatment. Serum levels
of carnitine were determined using an enzymatic cycling method (19).
Serum levels of myostatin were determined using a commercially
available ELISA kit (Kamiya Biomedical Company, Seattle,
Washington, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol (20).
Written informed consent was obtained from each patient after the
potential complications of sorafenib treatment were fully explained.

Figure 1. Change in skeletal muscle index in patients with Child-Pugh
class A liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma treated with
sorafenib. In the assessment of presarcopenia, skeletal muscle index
(SMI) after sorafenib treatment (35.0±8 cm2/m2) was significantly lower
than before sorafenib treatment (36.7±6 cm2/m2).

Evaluation of efficacy. Tumor response was assessed from patients’
dynamic CT scans obtained before and 4 weeks after sorafenib
treatment, according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria
in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) (21, 22).
Definition of sarcopenia. Sarcopenia was also assessed from patients’
CT scans obtained before and 4 weeks after sorafenib treatment. The
tissue Hounsfield unit (HU) limit for skeletal muscles on the CT
images was –29 HU to +150 HU. The third lumbar vertebra (L3) was
used as a standard landmark. Skeletal muscles at the L3 level included
the erector spinae, transverse abdominis, psoas, quadratus lumborum,
internal and external oblique abdominal muscle and the rectus
abdominis muscle; these muscles were identified on the CT images.
Cross-sectional areas (cm2) of the muscles were measured by
manually tracing on CT images, and their sum was calculated (23).
The cross-sectional areas were normalized for patient height [skeletal
muscle index (SMI), cm2/m2].
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed by using the
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS version 11.0; SPSS,
Chicago, IL, USA). Results are expressed as the mean±standard
deviation (SD). Normally distributed variables were compared
between the two groups using Student’s test and other variables were
compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Wilcoxon’s signed-rank
sum test was used to compare patient characteristics within each
group. p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
This study was approved by the Ethical Review Board of Toho
University Medical Center, Omori Hospital (number M17085).
Results
Clinical characteristics of 110 patients with liver cirrhosis
and advanced HCC. There were 92 men and 18 women aged
45-86 years (mean±SD: 69.4±9 years); 81 patients had CP￾A liver function and 29 had CP-B. Twenty-two patients had
hepatitis B virus-related LC (HBV-LC), 58 had hepatitis C
virus-related LC (HCV-LC), and 30 patients had non HBV
and non HCV-related LC (non HBV, non HCV-LC). Four
patients had stage III, 84 patients had stage IVA disease, and
22 patients had stage IVB disease. Nineteen patients had
portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) of the primary branch
of the portal vein (Vp3) and 13 patients had PVTT of the
portal trunk (Vp4).
Sorafenib had been administered to 11 patients at a dose
of 200 mg/day, to 84 patients at 400 mg/day, and to 22
patients at 800 mg/day. Six patients showed a partial
response (PR) to treatment and 66 patients showed stable
disease (SD), but 38 patients had progressive disease (PD).
The objective response rate (ORR) was 5.5 %, although no
patient showed complete response (CR) (Table I). We
analyzed CP-A and CP-B separately.

received sorafenib and BCAA (Table VI). Patients who
received BCAA and sorafenib showed no significant
differences in serum ammonia or transaminase levels before
and after treatment. However, patients who received sorafenib
without BCAA had significantly elevated serum ammonia and
transaminase levels after treatment. Regardless of BCAA
supplementation, serum levels of albumin and creatine
decreased after sorafenib treatment, while serum levels of
direct bilirubin and DCP increased after sorafenib treatment
(Table VII). Regarding assessment of presarcopenia, SMI in
patients with LC significantly decreased after 4 weeks of
sorafenib treatment, whether BCAA were added (before:
36.8±5, after: 31.3±4 cm2/m2) or not (before: 37.8±5; after:
31.0±2 cm2/m2) (Figure 7).
Discussion
In the present retrospective study, we assessed presarcopenia
in patients with LC and HCC before and after 4 weeks of
treatment with sorafenib. These patients underwent
locoregional therapy, such as transarterial chemoembolization
or arterial infusion chemotherapy, after 4 weeks of sorafenib.
Sarcopenia is characterized by skeletal muscle mass depletion
(24, 25). Skeletal mass is generally maintained by a balance
between protein synthesis and breakdown. Patients with LC
have insufficient glycogen stores because of the deterioration
of liver function and energy generation patterns in these
patients after an overnight fasting are equivalent to those
observed in healthy controls after 2 or 3 days of starvation.
These catabolic states increase amino acid consumption and
accelerate skeletal muscle breakdown, releasing amino acids
and eventually leading to sarcopenia (26). BCAA
supplementation was reported to prevent the development of
sarcopenia in patients with LC (27), but in the present study,
SMI in patients with LC significantly decreased after 4 weeks
of sorafenib treatment regardless of whether they also received
BCAA. Moreover, sorafenib inhibits OCTN2 function by
approximately 24% (18). Therefore, this retrospective study
was performed to clarify the induction of sarcopenia in HCC

Figure 8. Schematic of β-oxidation in carnitine metabolism in patients with liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma treated with sorafenib.
Sorafenib inhibits the human organic cationic transporter OCTN2 in the cell membrane and this results in inhibition of carnitine absorption.
Carnitine binds to long-chain acyl-coenzyme A and converts it to acylcarnitine, which is transported to mitochondria and degraded by β-oxidation.
Decreases in carnitine and acyl-CoA block β-oxidation, and decreases in acyl-CoA block the tricarboxylic acid and urea cycles.

patients treated with sorafenib by assessing the metabolism of
carnitine. We found that SMI significantly decreased after
sorafenib treatment compared to that before sorafenib
treatment and that those results were observed regardless of
CP class (A or B). Serum levels of total and free carnitine
were significantly lower after sorafenib treatment than those
before, regardless of CP class. However, serum levels of
acylcarnitine in patients with CP-B LC and HCC were
significantly greater after sorafenib treatment than those
before, whereas patients with CP-A LC showed no significant
difference in serum levels of acylcarnitine before and after
sorafenib treatment. Moreover, there was no significant
difference in serum levels of myostatin in patients with CP￾A/B LC with HCC before and after sorafenib treatment.
Carnitine binds to long-chain acyl-coenzyme A and
converts it to acylcarnitine, which is transported to
mitochondria and degraded by β-oxidation (28). Thus,
deficiency of carnitine causes lipid metabolism dysfunction,
resulting in hepatic steatosis, skeletal myopathy, and
cardiopathy (14, 15). Myostatin is a cytokine of the
transforming growth factor beta family and suppresses skeletal
muscle synthesis, resulting in a loss of muscle mass (29). In
the present study, serum levels of acylcarnitine in patients with
CP-A LC were not lower after sorafenib treatment than before,
whereas serum levels of total carnitine and free carnitine
decreased. This phenomenon might mean that acylcarnitine
was slightly degraded by the midly disturbed β-oxidation in
patients with CP-A LC. However, in patients with CP-B LC,
serum levels of acylcarnitine increased significantly after
sorafenib, and total carnitine and free carnitine decreased. This
may suggest that serum levels of acylcarnitine are determined
by the degree of degradation of β-oxidation (Figure 8). Some
studies have indicated that hyperammonemia can cause
sarcopenia (30). Hyperammonemia is seen in cirrhosis and
plays a major role in the pathogenesis of hepatic
encephalopathy, for which sarcopenia is the main risk factor
(31). Serum carnitine levels remain within the standard range
in patients with LC, and blood carnitine and ammonia
concentrations are not significantly correlation (32). In the
present study, serum levels of ammonia in patients with CP￾ANTICANCER RESEARCH 40: 4173-4182 (2020)

Figure 9. Schematic of protein catabolism in carnitine metabolism in patients with liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma treated with
sorafenib. Inhibition of carnitine absorption by sorafenib blocks glycolysis, and the tricarboxylic acid and urea cycles. This inhibition, in turn,
blocks lipid metabolism and induces protein catabolism. Decreasing muscle mass increases myostatin and this suppress the synthesis of muscle
protein. These phenomena cause a decrease in muscle mass and increase in ammonia levels.

A LC increased after sorafenib treatment by disturbing β￾oxidation induced by impaired absorption of carnitine,
whereas ammonia remained high in patients with CP-B LC.
These phenomena can be explained by the extent to which β￾oxidation is disrupted. Moreover, there were significant
differences in serum levels of myostatin before and after
sorafenib treatment in patients with both classes of LC,
although protein catabolism might be induced by the decrease
in lipid metabolism (Figure 9). An increase in protein
catabolism might have been detected, had we assessed effects
of presarcopenia in patients with LC who received sorafenib
for more than 4 weeks.
We did not assesse food intake in the present study.
However, no cases of grade 3 or 4 anorexia were reported as
a complication of sorafenib, although there were cases of
grade 1 (39%) and grade 2 (9%) anorexia (2). In the present
study, sorafenib treatment was for 4 weeks, and all patients
had an appetite decline of Grade 2 or less. Therefore, it was
considered that the reduction of carnitine intake by diet did
not affect the results of this study. Sorafenib might induce
sarcopenia by inhibiting carnitine absorption. Hiramatsu et
al. reported that levocarnitine seems to dose-dependently
suppress the progression of sarcopenia, and this was
associated with improvements in hyperammonemia in
patients with LC (33). Further research is needed to assess
the effects of levocarnitine on serum levels of carnitine in
patients with LC and HCC who receive sorafenib.
Conclusion
Sorafenib might decrease serum levels of carnitine by
inhibiting carnitine absorption and decreasing serum levels
of carnitine might induce presarcopenia. Since TKIs are
likely to increase in importance as anti-cancer agents when
treating patients with LC and HCC, it is important to prevent
presarcopenia by taking measures to prevent disorders of
carnitine absorption as result of TKI treatment.
