Abstract
Clonal expansion of CD41 T cells is a characteristic finding
in patients with RA and is only infrequently found in pa￾tients with psoriatic arthritis and healthy controls. Ex￾panded CD41 clonotypes are present in the blood, infiltrate
into the joint, and persist over years. We have now ad￾dressed the question of whether the expanded clonotypes
have unique functional and phenotypic properties which
may explain the preferential in vivo expansion in RA. In
contrast to most CD41 T cells, expanded clonotypes lacked
the expression of the CD28 and CD7 cell surface molecules.
Accordingly, the subsets of CD41 CD282 (9.7 vs. 1.7, P 5
0.00002) and CD41 CD72 T cells (21.5 vs. 12.6, P 5 0.018)
were increased in RA patients compared with age-matched
normal individuals. Despite the lack of CD28 expression,
clonally expanded CD41 T cells were not anergic but prolif￾erated in response to immobilized anti-CD3 and could be
maintained in tissue culture. In vivo expanded CD41 T cells
were autoreactive to ubiquitously distributed autoantigens.
They responded in an autologous mixed lymphocyte reac￾tion, and T cell clones isolated from selected patients prolif￾erated to autologous peripheral blood adherent cells. These
data suggest that in RA patients selected CD41 T cells
which share the CD72 CD282 phenotype escape from pe￾ripheral tolerance. (J. Clin. Invest. 1996. 97:2027–2037.)

Introduction
Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by dense lymphoid infil￾trates in the synovial membrane associated with progressive
destruction of the joint architecture (1). Most RA patients
have additional disease manifestations not related to the joint
inflammation, and z 10% develop severe extraarticular organ
involvement which often presents as vasculitis or as Felty’s
syndrome (2). Extraarticular manifestations have a very strong
HLA-DRB1 association, and most of these patients are het￾erozygous or homozygous for two disease-associated HLA￾DRB1*04 alleles (3, 4). These findings have led to the hypoth￾esis that T cells influence disease mechanisms in RA beyond
the recognition of a defined arthritogenic antigen.
We have recently described that patients with RA express
a unique repertoire of T cell receptor (TCR)1
 genes in the na￾ive CD41 T cell population (5). These repertoire changes are
only partially explained by the HLA-DRB1*04 association of
the disease, suggesting that additional mechanisms influence
the outcome of thymic selection in RA patients (5). Additional
evidence for a generalized abnormality in T cell homeostasis in
RA comes from the finding that RA patients carry multiple
clonally expanded CD41 T cells (6). Expanded CD4 clono￾types are infrequent in normal HLA-DRB1*041 controls, as
well as in HLA-DRB1*041 patients with a nonrheumatoid
polyarthritis such as psoriatic arthritis (6a). Typically these
clonotypes are detected in the peripheral blood and, in about
similar frequencies, in the inflamed joint, indicating that they
do not represent a consequence of ongoing synovitis. While
clonotypes vary in their frequency, they persist over several
years. A core group of three BV genes, BV3, 14, and 17, is
used by the majority of T cells having undergone in vivo clonal
expansion in RA patients. This unique TCR repertoire led us
to hypothesize that these clonotypes may originate from a spe￾cialized subset of T cells with defined immunological func￾tions. To pursue this hypothesis, we have phenotypically and
functionally characterized expanded CD41 clonotypes in RA
patients. Their phenotype in vitro and in vivo identifies them
as CD41 T cells lacking the expression of the CD28 and the
CD7 molecules. CD282 CD41 T cells are rare in normal indi￾viduals but expanded in RA patients. Expanded clonotypes
exhibited an unusual functional profile in that they prolifer￾ated in response to autologous antigen presenting cells (APC).
Our findings suggest that RA patients have a unique subset of
T cells prone to escape from peripheral tolerance and prolifer￾ate in vivo.
Methods
Study population. Peripheral blood was obtained from patients with
seropositive erosive RA. Patients were characterized for their HLA￾DRB1 alleles by PCR and subsequent oligonucleotide hybridization
as described (4). Results are shown in Table I. Normal individuals
without personal or family history of RA were age-matched to the
disease population. A second control group consisted of 13 HLA￾DRB1*04 normal individuals.
Cell purification. PBMC were separated from heparinized venous
blood by Ficoll gradient centrifugation. Cells were stained with vari￾ous combinations of phycoerythrin (PE)- and FITC-conjugated mAb
and sorted on a FACSVantage®. The following combinations of anti￾bodies were used: anti-CD3 and anti-CD4, anti-CD4 and anti￾CD45RO, anti-CD4 and anti-CD28, anti-CD4 and anti-CD7, and anti￾CD4 and anti-CD57 (all from Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA).

Identification of in vivo expanded clonotypes. Total RNA of 1 3
106
 CD31 CD41 cells was extracted by guanidinium thiocyanate phe￾nol chloroform extraction using a commercially available kit. cDNA
was amplified with six BV specific primers (BV2, 3, 5S1, 8, 14, and 17)
and a BC specific primer (7). A 1:100 dilution of the amplified tem￾plate was reamplified with the appropriate BV primer combined with
primers specific for the different BJ elements. The following BJ prim￾ers were used: BJ1S1 (TGCCTTGTCCAAAGAAAGC), BJ1S2
(ACCTGGTCCCCGAACCGAAGG), BJ1S3 (TACAACAGTGA￾GCCAACTT), BJ1S4 (AGACAGAGAGCTGGGTTCCAC), BJ1S5
(GATGGAGAGTCGAGTCCCATCA), BJ1S6 (TCACAGTGAG￾CCTGGTCCCATT), BJ2S1 (CCTCTAGCACGGTGAGCCGT),
BJ2S2 (GGTCAGCCTAGAGCCTT), BJ2S3 (TGCCTGGGCCAA￾AATACT), BJ2S4 (CAGCACTGAGAGCCGGGTCCCGGCG),
BJ2S5 (ACCAGGAGCCGCGTGCCT), and BJ2S7 (ACCGTGAGC￾CTGGTGCCC). The amplified products were labeled using a primer
extension assay with the appropriate end-labeled BJ or BV primer
and were separated on a 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. For the
majority of samples, the analysis showed 8–12 bands for one particu￾lar BV-J combination with Gaussian distribution of band intensities.
Dominant bands within the Gaussian distribution were taken as evi￾dence for a clonal expansion. A band was defined as dominant if the
intensity of the band was larger than the sum of two adjacent bands
and at least 30% of the total product. Dominance of a clonotype
within one BV-J combination was confirmed by direct sequencing of
the total BV-J amplification product by reverse transcriptase (RT)-
mediated dideoxy sequencing as described (6, 8). Previous experi￾ments had shown that one particular clonotype had to be . 25% of
all T cells having the particular BV-BJ combinations to give an un￾equivocal sequence (6). CD41 T cells were subsequently sorted for
the expression of the CD7, CD28, CD45RO, and CD57 markers. BV-J
combinations which harbored dominant clonotypes were analyzed in
the CD4 subsets for the presence of the clonotype.
T cell cloning. CD41 T cells from selected patients were stimu￾lated with immobilized anti-CD3 for 6 h and cloned by limiting dilu￾tion on irradiated EBV-transformed cell lines in the presence of 20
U/ml recombinant IL-2. Established T cell clones were screened for
the expression of the TCR b chain sequence corresponding to the se￾quence which had been found to be clonally expanded in vivo. To de￾termine antigen specificity, 6 3 104
 T cell clones were cocultured with
1 3 105
 irradiated (3,000 rad) autologous mononuclear cells for 72 h.
Proliferative responses were determined by [3H]thymidine incorpora￾tion. In parallel cultures, cloned T cells were cultured with autologous
cells and 5 mg/ml L243 (anti-HLA-DR) and L227 (anti-HLA-DR and
DQ), respectively.
Immunophenotyping. T cell clones were stained with the follow￾ing mAbs: FITC anti-CD3, PE and FITC anti-CD4, FITC anti-CD5,
FITC anti-CD7, PE anti-CD8, PE anti-CD28, PE anti-CD45RO, PE
anti-CD56, and FITC anti-CD57 (all from Becton Dickinson). PBMC
from RA patients and from normal controls and mononuclear cells
from synovial fluid were stained with anti-CD4 PERCP, anti-CD28
PE, and either anti-CD57 FITC or anti-CD7 FITC. Samples were an￾alyzed with a FACScan® using the PC Lysis software.
T cell assays. PBMC were depleted of CD81 cells by incubation
with 40 mg anti-CD8/106
 cells (OKT8, CRL 8014, American Type
Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) at 48C for 30 min and subsequent
incubation with magnetic beads coupled with anti–mouse Ig (Percep￾tive Diagnostic, Cambridge, MA). 1 3 105
 cells were cocultured with
1 3 105
 irradiated autologous adherent cells (obtained by plastic ad￾herence of PBMC on serum-coated Petri dishes for 2 h). Cells were
harvested on days 7 and 10 and total RNA was obtained. Parallel cul￾tures were assayed for proliferative responses by [3H]thymidine in￾corporation. Control cultures included cells cultured on immobilized
anti-CD3 for 5 d and cells cultured with 1 mg/ml SE B and SE C2
(Toxin Technology, Sarasota, FL) for 5 d. Total RNA was amplified
by RT-PCR with BV and BJ specific primer sets, and the amplified
products were size fractionated as described above. The intensity of
dominant bands corresponding to in vivo expanded clonotypes was
semiquantified using phosphorimage analysis (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Richmond, CA) and the phosphoranalysis™/Macintosh software.
The intensities before and after culture were compared.
Results
Phenotype of clonally expanded CD41 T cells in RA patients.
To test the hypothesis that the CD41 T cells, which clonally ex￾pand in the peripheral repertoire of RA patients, have unique
functional properties, expanded clonotypes were isolated in in
vitro culture. RA patients were selected who carried several
CD41 clonotypes in the peripheral blood as determined by
PCR with BV and BJ specific primers, subsequent comple￾mentarity determining region 3 (CDR3) length analysis, and
direct sequencing. These clonotypes were stable over time and
found in at least two different blood samples several months
apart. PBMC were obtained and randomly cloned by limiting
dilution after stimulation with immobilized anti-CD3. Estab￾lished T cell clones were screened for the expression of the
TCR b chain sequence which had been found in the original
blood sample. Eight of such T cell clones from five different
RA patients were analyzed for the expression of nine cell sur￾face markers by FACS® analysis. The T cell clones derived
from the in vivo expanded T cells shared the CD31 CD41
CD82 CD21 phenotype. The profile of the cell surface mole￾cules shown in Table II was unusual for CD41 T cells. All eight
clones lacked the expression of CD7 and seven lacked CD28
expression. The clone KD1.1 which expressed CD28 could
also be isolated as a CD282 variant (data not shown). Four of
the clones expressed CD57 and one was negative for the CD5
molecule. In two of the clones, a small number of CD561 cells
was detected with the majority of the cells negative for this
marker. To exclude that this profile of cell surface markers
may relate to the in vitro culture, we tested seven CD31 CD41
T cell clones which had been isolated from healthy control in￾dividuals and which had been kept under the same tissue cul￾ture conditions. These T cell clones showed a more uniform
pattern, in particular, all of them expressed CD28. However,
all but one were also negative for CD7, raising the possibility
that CD7 was lost during the tissue culture.
The lack of CD28 expression is an infrequent finding in hu￾man peripheral blood CD41 T cells, suggesting that expanded
T cell clones were derived from a small subset of peripheral
blood CD41 T cells (9). Most human peripheral T cells are also
positive for the CD7 marker (10); however, the significance of

Clonal T Cell Expansion in Rheumatoid Arthritis 2029
the lack of CD7 expression by the in vivo expanded T cell
clones was indeterminate. To address the question of whether
the phenotypic profile of the isolated CD41 T cell clones re￾flected the cell surface expression of clonal CD4 population in
vivo, CD41 T cells from RA patients were screened for
clonally expanded populations by PCR and spectrotyping.
CD41 cells were subsequently sorted for the expression of the
CD7, CD28, CD45RO, and CD57 markers. CD41 T cell sub￾populations positive and negative for the respective marker
were compared by PCR with the appropriate BV-BJ primer
set and spectrotyping for the presence of the dominant TCR
transcript which had been identified in the unseparated CD4
populations. Fig. 1 shows a Gaussian distribution of TCR tran￾scripts with different CDR3 lengths after BV17-BJ1S1 specific
amplification in the CD41, CD572, CD281, and CD71 popula￾tions. A dominant band of equal size corresponding to the
clonal specificity was identified in the CD72, CD282, and
CD571 subsets. Results for 21 different clonotypes from six
RA patients are summarized in Table III. All expanded clono￾types expressed the CD45RO molecule, characterizing them
as memory T cells. 4 of 11 clonotypes analyzed were detected
in the CD45RO1, as well as the CD45RO2 population, raising
the possibility that either some of the clonally proliferating
cells revert back to the naive phenotype or clonal expansion is
a feature of naive cells which eventually acquire the CD45RO
phenotype. Without an exception, all clonal T cell populations
were identified among CD282 CD41 T cells. In 3 of the 16
clonotypes, a fraction of the cells was positive for the CD28
molecule. Also, all of the analyzed clonally proliferating T cells
lacked the expression of CD7. Two clonotypes could also be
detected in the CD71 population. 10 of 11 tested clonotypes
were CD571 in vivo. Four clones were found among CD572
CD41 T cells.
Expansion of CD41 CD72 CD282 T cells in RA patients.
The finding that the in vivo expanded clonotypes predomi￾nantly expressed the CD41 CD282 CD72 phenotype raised
the question of whether the CD41 CD282 and the CD41
CD72 compartments are expanded in RA. To address this
question, the frequencies of CD41 CD72, CD41 CD282, and
CD41 CD571 T cells were determined by two-color FACS®
analysis in 22 patients with seropositive RA and 22 age￾matched controls (Fig. 2). In control individuals, CD28 was ab￾sent on a small population of CD41 T cells. A median fraction
of 12.6% of CD41 T cells was negative for CD7. CD57 was ex￾pressed on a small subset of CD41 T cells accounting for a me￾dian of 1.5%. All three CD41 T cell subsets were expanded in
RA patients. Most significantly, the percentages of CD41
CD282 T cells were increased in patients (9.7 vs. 1.7%; P 5
0.00002). The size of the CD41 CD72 subset was almost dou￾bled in the patient cohort with a median frequency of 21.5%
(P 5 0.018). The expansion was least marked for CD41 CD571
T cells (3.2 vs. 1.5%; P 5 0.13). In addition to age, HLA-DR

PBMC from five RA patients were randomly cloned after activation
with immobilized anti-CD3. T cell clones expressing a TCR b chain se￾quence which had been found to be dominant in the peripheral blood
CD41 T cell compartment were identified and characterized for their
cell surface markers. Control clones were derived from normal individu￾als and randomly chosen. *50–80% of all T cells expressed the respec￾tive marker; ‡ 20–50% positive for the marker.
Figure 1. Identification of expanded clonotypes in CD41 T cell sub￾sets. To confirm the cell surface phenotype of expanded clonotypes in 
vivo, CD41 T cells were sorted from PBMC of RA patients and ana￾lyzed for the presence of expanded clonotypes by PCR with primer 
sets for 72 BV-BJ combinations (6 BV and 12 BJ gene segments), 
subsequent spectrotyping and direct sequencing. A representative ex￾ample of a BV17-BJ1S11 clonotype is shown. CD41 T cells were sub￾sequently separated according to the expression of the CD28, the 
CD7, and the CD57 marker. The CD41 CD281, CD41 CD71, and the 
CD41 CD572 populations showed Gaussian distribution of BV17-
BJ1S1 transcripts indicating T cell polyclonality. In contrast, the T 
cell clone could be detected within the CD282, CD72, and the CD571
population of CD4 T cells. Clonal identity was confirmed by sequenc￾ing the CDR3 region. All dominant bands expressed the same se￾quence (BV17-CASSARRGARAF-BJ1S1).

polymorphism might influence the frequency of the CD41
CD282 population. 19 of the 22 RA patients expressed one of
the disease-associated HLA-DRB1*04 alleles. Therefore, Fig.
2 contains a second control group of 13 healthy HLA-DR4 in￾dividuals. There was no evidence that the HLA-DRB1*04
polymorphism alone was sufficient to explain the expansion of
the CD41 CD282 compartment in the RA patients.

CD41 T cells were purified from PBMC of six RA patients by cell sorting. Expanded CD41 clonotypes were identified by TCR BV-BJ specific RT￾PCR and subsequent CDR3 length analysis as described in Fig. 1. Fresh PBMC were separated into CD41 CD45RO1 and CD41 CD45RO2, CD41
CD281 and CD41 CD282, CD41 CD71 and CD41 CD72, and CD41 CD571 and CD41 CD572 cells by FACS® sorting. The T cell subsets were then
analyzed for the presence of the clonal specificity which was originally identified in the unseparated CD4 population by RT-PCR and CDR3 length
analysis. Blank areas indicate experiments not done; ND, not detectable; FACS® sorted cell population was too small for RNA extraction.

Clonal T Cell Expansion in Rheumatoid Arthritis 2031
gested a correlation between the expansion of the CD282 and
CD72 compartments. To address that question, CD41 T cells
from patients with RA were analyzed by three-color FACS®
analysis. These studies demonstrated that the majority of
CD282 CD41 T cells were also lacking the CD7 marker and
virtually all CD571 CD41 T cells were included in the CD282
subset (Fig. 3). We concluded from these experiments that RA
patients have an abnormality in their CD41 T cell compart￾ment which can be assigned to a subpopulation expressing the
CD72 CD282 CD571 phenotype. This T cell compartment is
expanded in RA and the expansion is at least partially due to
the emergence of oligoclonal T cell populations.
Clonally expanded T cells express CD28 in the synovial
compartment. CD41 CD282 CD72 T cells are selectively ex￾panded in RA patients; however, it is not clear how they relate
to the synovial inflammation. To compare the representation
of these cells in the peripheral blood and in the joint, paired
samples collected from the blood and from synovial fluid were
studied. CD41 T cells, which were clonally expanded in the pe￾ripheral blood, were also encountered in the synovial fluid and
in the synovial tissue. Analysis of CD4 subsets of the paired
samples demonstrated that T cell clonotypes which lacked the
CD28 marker in the peripheral blood compartment could be
identified in the CD41 CD281 and the CD41 CD282 compart￾ments in the synovial fluid (Fig. 4). Also, expansion of the
CD41 CD282 T cell compartment was a characteristic finding
for the blood but not for the synovial environment. Percent￾ages of the CD282 T cells were reduced in the synovial fluid in
four of the six patients studied. In contrast, CD41 CD571 and
CD41 CD72 T cells were even more enriched in the synovial
fluid (Fig. 5). These results suggest that either CD41 CD72
CD282 T cells home to the joint and regain CD28 expression
in the synovial compartment or that these clonotypes are pri￾marily CD281 in the joint and subsequently lose the expres￾sion of this cell surface marker.
CD41 CD282 clonotypes are not anergic and respond to au￾tologous cells. Signaling of the TCR in the absence of costimu￾latory signals provided by the CD28 pathway results in anergy

three-color FACS® analysis. Results are shown for CD41 CD281 and CD41 CD282 T cells. The vast majority of CD281 T cells expressed the 
CD7 marker while CD282 CD41 T cells expressed low levels or no CD7. Expression of the CD57 marker correlated with lack of CD28 expression.

of the responding T cell (11, 12). To examine the responsive￾ness of expanded clonotypes, purified CD41 T cells from RA
patients were activated by either immobilized anti-CD3 or by
the bacterial superantigens SE B and SE C2 and autologous
adherent cells. In vivo expanded clonotypes were identified
and semiquantified in the unstimulated CD4 population by
PCR with BV-J primer sets, including BV3, 14, and 17 specific
primers. This spectrum of BV primers was chosen because
these BV elements are frequently used by expanded clono￾types in RA. The two enterotoxins were selected because they
are stimulatory for T cells expressing these BV elements. Cells
were harvested 5 d after anti-CD3 and superantigen stimula￾tion. The T cell repertoire before and after stimulation was
compared by BV-BJ specific PCR, size fractionation according
to the CDR3 length, and subsequent quantification by phos￾phorimage analysis. Clonal expansion generally results in the
expansion of the fraction of TCR sharing a particular CDR3
length. Determining the fraction of TCR sharing one CDR3
size by phosphorimage analysis, therefore, allowed an approxi￾mate estimate of the clonal size. An increase or persistence of
the peak corresponding to a particular CDR3 length indicated
proliferation of the T cell clone. Normalization of the distribu￾tion and disappearance of the peak indicated that the clone did
not proliferate under the conditions used. Results of 37 in vivo
expanded clonotypes are summarized in Fig. 6. More than
70% of all clonotypes persisted after anti-CD3 stimulation. A
minority of CD4 clonotypes decreased or disappeared after
anti-CD3 stimulation; however, all were retrieved in the super￾antigen-driven cultures. These data clearly demonstrated that
the expanded clonotypes are not anergic in vivo although they
lack the CD28 costimulatory molecule.
To test the question of whether the antigen recognized by
these clonotypes represents an endogenous self-antigen, an au￾tologous mixed lymphocyte reaction (AMLR) was used. All
37 in vivo expanded clonotypes which had been tested for the
proliferative response to immobilized anti-CD3 and the super￾antigens SE B and SE C2 were also analyzed in AMLR. Ex￾panded clonotypes were semiquantified after 7 and 10 d of cul￾ture with autologous adherent cells. Results at the two time
points of the culture period showed a high correlation. A rep￾resentative example of a phosphorimage analysis of a BV14-
BJ1S3 amplification product which included an expanded
clonotype is shown in Fig. 7. TCR sequences showing the
CDR3 length representing the clonotype constituted 35% of
the total BV14-BJ1S3 amplification in unstimulated PBMC
compared with 44% after 10 d of AMLR. Results of the
AMLR experiments on all clones are summarized in Fig. 6.
71% of all clonotypes responded to autologous cells. Most
clonotypes (56% of all clones tested) were reactive to immobi￾lized anti-CD3 as well as in the AMLR. The interpretation
that CD41 CD282 CD72 T cell clones proliferated in the
AMLR was further supported by phenotypic studies. Cultures
obtained after AMLR showed an enrichment of CD41 CD72
CD282 cells. A representative experiment is shown in Fig. 8.
In this RA patient, the CD4 population before stimulation in￾cluded 39% of CD282 T cells. Upon coculture with autologous
adherent cells, this percentage increased to 75%. To further
address the hypothesis that the expanded clonotypes recognize
endogenous antigen on autologous APC, six T cell clones,
which had been isolated from three RA patients and which
were derived from in vivo expanded clonotypes, were cultured
in the presence and absence of autologous irradiated PBMC.
The autologous cells were able to induce proliferation of all of
these T cell clones (Fig. 9). Addition of the HLA-DR specific

HLA-DR molecules (data not shown).
Discussion
Experiments presented here were designed to address the
question of whether clonally expanded CD41 T cell popula￾tions in patients with RA are derived from a phenotypically
and functionally characterized subset of CD41 T cells which
may be prone to clonal proliferation. Several lines of evidence
indicate that clonal CD41 T cell populations which dominate
the peripheral repertoire have disease relevance. They are
consistently found in RA patients but are infrequent in pa￾tients with psoriatic polyarthritis and thus are not simply a con￾sequence of a chronic inflammatory response. This interpreta￾tion is emphasized by the finding that the clonally expanded
populations are present very early in the disease process and
do not further accumulate within the first decade of disease
progression. Also, we have identified expanded CD41 clono￾types in unaffected siblings of RA patients, raising the possibil￾ity that they represent the consequence of a gene inherited in
RA families and thus could be a risk factor for the disease.
Further evidence for their role in the disease process comes
from their infiltration into the joint where they are consistently
found (6).
Figure 4. Expanded clonotypes in the synovial compartment express 
CD28. CD41 CD281 and CD41 CD282 T cells were purified from pe￾ripheral blood and from synovial fluid of an RA patient. cDNA was 
analyzed for the presence of dominant clonotypes by BV-BJ amplifi￾cation and subsequent CDR3 length analysis. In the peripheral blood, 
the BV17-BJ1S1 CD4 clonotype was identified only in the CD282, 
but not in the CD281 compartment. In contrast, the clonotype was 
present in the CD41 CD282 and the CD41 CD281 T cell populations 
derived from the synovial fluid. Identity of the dominant band was 
confirmed by direct sequencing (BV17-CASSTRVCNTEAF-BJ1S1).

Clonal T Cell Expansion in Rheumatoid Arthritis 2033
Phenotypic analysis of expanded clonotypes isolated from
RA patients indicated that they exhibited a unique phenotype,
in particular, they lacked the expression of the CD28 molecule.
In vivo studies on a large panel of expanded clonotypes con￾firmed the phenotypic profile as CD41 CD72 CD282 CD571.
Two models could explain the compartmentalization of the ex￾panded clonotypes. Possibly expanding clonotypes could be
derived from a separate lineage of CD41 T cells. Alternatively,
CD41 CD72 CD282 T cells originate from CD41 CD71
CD281 cells but undergo a functional and phenotypic change
in response to a defined environment. Chronic polyarthritis
could represent such an environment. The low frequency of
expanded clonotypes in psoriatic arthritis, their presence in
very early disease, and their expression in unaffected siblings
all argue against chronic inflammation providing the setting
for CD41 CD71 CD281 cells to acquire the CD72 CD282 phe￾notype. Some of the expanded CD4 clonotypes were found
among CD45RO2 and CD45RO1 subsets. We cannot distin￾guish between the two models that oligoclonal populations ex￾ist within the subset of CD41 CD45RO2 cells before they ac￾quire the CD45RO phenotype or whether CD41 CD45RO1 T
cells revert to the naive phenotype (13, 14). Data have been
presented that the thymic selection of murine CD42 CD82 T
cells is biased by dominant HLA–peptide complexes and that
therefore clonotypes with identical amino acid sequences are
generated during thymic selection (15, 16). We have se￾quenced multiple independently derived clonotypes from
three patients and have not found evidence for sequence het￾erogeneity at the nucleotide level (reference 6 and data not
shown). Thus, our evidence suggests that these clonotypes de￾rived from the same progenitor cell and were not indepen￾dently selected in the thymus.
CD41 CD282 T cells represent a very minor cell population
in normal individuals and usually account for 0.1–2.5% of
CD41 T cells (9). The biological function of these cells is un￾clear; however, the absence of the costimulatory molecule
CD28 sets them apart from other CD41 T cells. CD7 is present
on the majority of mature T cells, but expression is lost on a
subset of CD41 memory T cells (10). Increased frequencies of
CD72 T cells have been described in the blood and synovial
compartment of RA patients (17). Expansion of the CD72
T cell subset is also a frequent finding in patients with HIV
infection (18, 19). CD72 CD41 T cells may not represent an
end stage of T cell differentiation, but may be associated with
special function as suggested by the homing pattern of CD72
CD41 T cells. Sezary cells which are pathognomic for the
leukemic variant of the cutaneous T cell lymphoma mycosis
fungoides are typically CD72 (20). CD72 CD41 T cells also
represent a major subpopulation of the infiltrates in inflamma￾tory skin diseases suggesting that these cells tend to accumu￾late at inflammatory sites (21).
The sizes of the clonal T cell populations presented here
are rather small, in the order of 0.1–1% of the total CD4 T cell
repertoire. Thus, if all T cell clones are CD72 CD282 and the
majority are CD571, one would expect a modest expansion of
these compartments in RA patients. Results shown in Fig. 2
demonstrate that this is the case for the CD72 and the CD282
CD41 compartments. In some of the RA patients, the expan￾sion of the CD282 CD72 CD41 T cell compartment was larger
than one would expect from the presence of several clono￾types. 3 out of the 22 RA patients studied had a frequency of
CD282 cells of . 35% of CD41 T cells. Also, the expansion of
the CD282 subset in RA patients was much more pronounced
than the expansion of the CD41 CD571 subset. These data
suggest that the expansion of CD282 CD41 cells may not only
be a consequence of clonal expansion but may be a genuine
phenomenon in RA patients preceding clonal expansion. In
support of this hypothesis, we have analyzed expanded CD41
CD282 populations sharing a BV element and have found that
these populations also include polyclonally expanded T cells
(data not shown). Interestingly, we were also able to identify a
few normal donors who had elevated levels of CD41 CD282

cells in synovial fluid. PBMC 
and synovial fluid mononuclear 
cells from six patients with RA 
were analyzed by two-color 
FACS® analysis for the expres￾sion of the CD7, CD28, and the 
CD57 marker in CD41 T cells. 
While there was significant en￾richment of CD72 (P 5 0.03) 
and CD571 (P 5 0.03) CD41 T 
cells in the synovial fluid, the 
CD282 subset was smaller in the 
synovial fluid than in the periph￾eral blood.

T cells when compared with most normals. Therefore, it is pos￾sible that a subset of normal individuals expresses a phenotype
reminiscent of that found in RA patients, an interpretation
which would be consistent with a genetic control of the CD41
CD282 T cell subset. The HLA-DR4 molecule appears not to
be a risk factor to develop an expression of the CD41 CD282
subset. HLA-DR41 normal individuals did not have a higher
number of CD41 CD282 cells (Fig. 2) and the expansion in the
RA patients did not correlate with the expression of disease￾associated HLA-DRB1 alleles.
It cannot be decided whether the high frequency of CD282
CD41 T cells predisposes for clonal expansion or whether the
expansion of the CD282 compartment is the consequence of
numerous CD41 T cell clones, many of which may be below
the detection threshold. An intriguing observation is that
clonally expanded CD81 T cells are also characterized by the
lack of CD28 expression. CD81 CD282 T cells are not as un￾common as CD41 CD282 T cells. In fact, they represent a ma￾jor fraction of the CD8 compartment (22). Clonality within the
CD8 subset is a frequent finding in normal individuals, particu￾larly in the elderly (23–25). However, clonal proliferation of
peripheral CD81 T cells is more pronounced in RA patients
than in normal individuals (26, 27). Interestingly, clonal CD8
populations share a phenotypic similarity with the expanded
CD4 clonotypes identified in the RA patients. CD41 and
CD81 cells which have undergone clonal amplification in vivo
are CD282 and frequently CD571 (23, 25). The expression of
the CD7 molecule has not been analyzed on CD81 T cells. In
contrast to CD41 T cells, CD81 T cells generally maintain the
expression of CD7. CD72 T cells in the peripheral blood are
almost exclusively CD4. The common feature of lack of CD28
expression suggested that there might exist shared mecha￾nisms controlling clonal downsizing of proliferating CD41 and
CD81 T cells.
Programmed cell death represents a crucial mechanism
controlling clonal outgrowth of peripheral T cells and thus ap￾pears to be essential in maintaining diversity in the TCR reper￾toire (28–31). The tight association of antigen-induced prolif￾eration and activation-induced cell death (AICD) does not
only serve as a mechanism preventing chronic amplification of
selected T cell specificities but also leads to clonal exhaustion
and subsequently to the inability of the immune system to rec￾ognize a chronically persisting antigen (32, 33). Boise et al.
(34) have shown that stimulation of the CD28 pathway induces
bcl-xL expression. Thus, one would expect that CD282 T cells
are extremely sensitive to apoptosis-inducing signals; however,

CD41 clonotypes. Purified CD41 T cells 
were stimulated with immobilized anti￾CD3 for 5 d and with autologous irradiated 
mononuclear cells for 7 and 10 d. Total 
RNA was harvested and the T cell receptor 
repertoire before and after stimulation was 
compared by RT-PCR with BV-BJ specific 
primer sets and CDR3 length analysis. Ex￾panded T cell clonotypes were identified 
and the percentage of clonotypes which 
persisted and expanded under the stimula￾tion was determined. Results for 37 clones 
derived from 10 patients are summarized.

Gaussian distribution

yielded a dominant peak containing an expanded T cell clone. This 
clone persisted in the AMLR cultures.

not induce AICD. In contrast, Singer and Abbas (37) did not
find a difference in AICD analyzing in vitro generated TH1
and TH2 T cell clones from a TCR transgenic mouse. The
mechanism underlying the differential susceptibility to apopto￾sis-inducing signals in the CD41 CD282 T cell population is
unclear. Preliminary experiments have shown that CD282 and
CD281 T cell clones do not differ in their expression of bcl-2
(our unpublished observations). Also, we have analyzed the
lymphokine pattern of the T cell clones isolated in vitro and
have not found predominant production of TH2 specific cy￾tokines.
The memory phenotype and the oligoclonality of CD41
CD72 CD282 T cells in RA suggest previous antigen contact
of these cells. Several lines of evidence indicate that the ex￾panded clonotypes are not only the result of defective down￾sizing but that they are also driven by antigen stimulation. An￾tigen selection is suggested by the restricted BV repertoire of

adherent cells for the expression of the CD28 marker.
Figure 9. Proliferative response of in vivo 
expanded T cell clones to autologous APC. 
T cell clones which had been derived from 
in vivo expanded T cells of RA patients as 
described in Table II were cocultured with 
irradiated autologous PBMC (solid bars). 
Control cultures included T cell clones 
(shaded bars) or irradiated PBMC (open 
bars) only. Proliferative response was de￾termined by [3H]thymidine incorporation 
after a total culture period of 72 h. Results 
are shown as mean of triplicates.
the in vivo expansion suggests that the opposite may be the
case. Therefore, we tested the susceptibility of CD41 CD282 in
vivo expanded T cell clones isolated from RA patients toward
AICD and apoptosis induced by IL-2 withdrawal. After both
apoptosis-inducing signals, expanded T cells were less suscep￾tible to undergo programmed cell death (our unpublished ob￾servations).
Several reports have indicated that heterogeneity exists
within the CD4 compartment regarding the responsiveness to
apoptosis-inducing signals. CD45RO memory T cells express
less bcl-2 than naive cells and are therefore more prone to un￾dergo apoptosis when cultured in vitro in the absence of
growth factors (35). Ramsdell et al. (36) have described differ￾ences between TH1 and TH2 cells in their ability for AICD.
These authors have reported that TH1 cells synthesize Fas
ligand upon activation and can therefore provide the signal for
AICD. TH2 cells do not produce Fas ligand and therefore do

the proliferating T cells. Most expanded cells use a BV3, 14, or
17 gene segment (6). We have not seen sequence similarities in
the CDR3 region, which presumably contacts the antigen but
their heterogeneity might be due to plasticity in the TCR rep￾ertoire of antigen-specific T cells. Expanded clonotypes within
unseparated T cells as well as isolated T cell clones represent￾ing the clonally expanded population reacted to autologous
APC, suggesting that they recognize ubiquitous self-antigens
(Figs. 6 and 9).
It is not clear how the recognition of a ubiquitous autoanti￾gen may relate to the synovial inflammation. The finding that
the same clonotype is also CD281 in the synovial fluid but, al￾most exclusively, CD282 in the peripheral blood suggests that
the synovial compartment provides a unique environment for
these clonotypes. It is possible that CD282 T cells are activated
in the synovia and express CD28; however, we have failed to
induce CD28 expression in vitro in such cells. Alternatively,
the CD281 variant of the clonotype may either preferentially
home to the synovial fluid or these cells may have a selective
advantage to proliferate in the synovia.
Several characteristics of CD41 CD282 cells identify them
as a particularly interesting subset of cells in patients with RA.
They are a consistent finding in RA and are infrequent in pso￾riatic polyarthritis, their repertoire is unique due to clonal
expansion, they undergo apoptosis less efficiently, and they
proliferate in response to autologous APC. Lymphoprolifera￾tion of CD42 CD82 T cells has recently received attention as a
potentially important mechanism in the MRL/lpr and gld mod￾els of autoimmune disease (38, 39). Autoimmune phenomena
in the MRL/lpr mouse are dependent on CD41 T cells (40).
Whether a clonal outgrowth of selected CD41 T cells contrib￾utes to autoimmune disease in the MRL/lpr mouse is not un￾derstood. The disease in MRL/lpr mice shares many features
with RA which are distinctly absent in other animal models of
chronic inflammatory joint disease. MRL/lpr mice develop
rheumatoid factor–positive disease with erosive destruction of
joint tissues. Understanding lymphoproliferation and its role
in disease manifestations might provide valuable information
for both diseases.
