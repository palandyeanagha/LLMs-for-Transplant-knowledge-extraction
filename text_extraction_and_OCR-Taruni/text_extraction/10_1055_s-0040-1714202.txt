Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) can be complicated by
substantial perioperative blood loss which frequently neces￾sitates transfusion of blood products. As a result ofmedical and
technical advances, perioperative transfusion requirements
have declined substantially over time.1,2 Nevertheless, a sub￾stantial proportion of patients still require blood product
transfusions, which are associated with significant side
effects.3–6 We have previously demonstrated a dose-depen￾dent increase in postoperative mortality as a consequence of
blood product transfusion during OLT,3 which is in line with
studies on other surgical procedures, notably cardiac surgery.5
The perioperative transfusion requirements in patients
with cirrhosis undergoing OLT have historically been attrib￾uted to preoperative changes in the hemostatic system,
which further aggravate intraoperatively.7–10 Clinical and
laboratory studies from the past 15 years, however, have
demonstrated that the hemostatic balance in patients with
cirrhosis and in patients during OLT is relatively well pre￾served, although routine indices of hemostasis (platelet
count, prothrombin time) may suggest otherwise.11–13 In
addition, it has been demonstrated that such routine diag￾nostic tests fail to predict perioperative blood loss.14

Abstract There is increasing evidence that portal hypertension plays a major role in bleeding risk
during orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). We investigated the association between
preoperative blood levels of von Willebrand factor (VWF) and soluble CD163 (sCD163),
which are established markers of portal hypertension, and blood loss and transfusion
requirements during OLT. We measured levels of VWF and sCD163 in preoperative
serum samples of 168 adult patients undergoing a primary OLT between 1998 and
2012. Preoperative levels of VWF and sCD163 correlated with the model of end-stage
liver disease (MELD) score (r ¼ 0.414, p < 0.001 and r ¼ 0.382, p < 0.001, respectively).
Patients with high VWF or sCD163 levels (VWF and sCD163 levels above the median)
had a substantially increased risk of needing red blood cell transfusion compared with
patients with low VWF or sCD163 levels (VWF and sCD163 levels below the median)
(odds ratio 3.5 [95% confidence interval, CI 1.7–7.0] and 2.3 [95% CI 1.1–4.5],
respectively). Blood loss was highest in patients with both high VWF or sCD163 levels
and a high preoperative international normalized ratio. Elevated blood levels of
markers of portal hypertension are associated with increased blood loss and transfu￾sion requirements during OLT and support the notion that portal hypertension is an
important contributor to perioperative blood loss.

Apart from the preexisting coagulopathy, portal hyper￾tension has been implicated as a contributor to periopera￾tive blood loss during OLT.2,15 Multiple centers have
reported reductions in blood transfusion requirements
when enforcing a restricted fluid infusion policy, which is
aimed at preventing venous congestion and aggravation of
portal hypertension.16,17 One center has taken this concept
a step further and performs preoperative phlebotomy in a
proportion of patients to lower central venous pressure to
prevent excessive blood loss.18 Despite indirect clinical
evidence, no studies providing direct evidence for a role
of portal hypertension in bleeding during OLT have to our
knowledge been performed. The difficulty in quantifying
portal hypertension (e.g., by hepatic-venous pressure gradi￾ent [HVPG] measurements) is likely responsible for this lack
of data.
Recently, it was shown that plasma levels of von Wille￾brand factor (VWF) and soluble CD163 (sCD163) in patients
with cirrhosis correlate with HVPG and thus may be useful
minimally invasive markers for portal hypertension.19–21
VWF is released from endothelial cells, whereas sCD163 is
the extracellular part of a transmembrane receptor specific
for macrophages (including Kupffer cells). It thus appears
that VWF and sCD163 relate to portal hypertension via
distinct mechanisms. In this study we investigated the
hypothesis that high preoperative blood levels of VWF and
sCD163 are associated with increased blood loss and trans￾fusion requirements during OLT.
Methods
Patients
Since 1996, we prospectively collect serum samples from
patients who are candidates for OLT in the University Medical
Center Groningen. Between 1996 and 2012, 833 patients
underwent OLT in our center. We excluded patients under￾going a retransplantation (n ¼ 145), pediatric patients (de￾fined as age < 18 years at the time of OLT, n ¼ 301), and
patients undergoing OLT for acute liver failure (n ¼ 63). Of
the remaining 325 patients, serum samples taken within
30 days prior to OLT were available for 168 patients.
Ethics Statement
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of
the University Medical Center Groningen.
VWF and sCD163 Analyses
We determined VWF antigen and sCD163 antigen levels with
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays using polyclonal
antibodies to VWF (Dako) and monoclonal antibodies to
sCD163 (R&D System).
Demographic Data
Patient charts were used to collect demographic data, type of
liver disease, preoperative international normalized ratio
(INR), model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, and
estimated blood loss (referred to as blood loss) and red blood
cell (RBC) transfusion requirements during OLT.
Statistical Analyses
Data are presented as medians with interquartile range
(IQR) or as numbers with percentages. The Pearson’s cor￾relation coefficient was used to determine correlations
between VWF, sCD163, the INR, blood loss, and transfusion
requirements. We additionally analyzed the relation
between VWF and sCD163 levels and the INR and blood
loss/transfusion requirements by defining high and low
levels. For this, data were divided into categories of patients
with levels below or at and above the median. The Mann
Whitney-U and the Kruskal–Wallis test were used to
determine differences in blood loss and transfusion
requirements between the different categories of VWF-,
sCD163-, and INR levels, as appropriate. The risk for RBC
transfusion for the different categories was determined
using the Fisher’s exact test and odds ratios (ORs) were
calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) according to
the approximation of Woolf. Analyses were performed
using the statistical software package SPSS/PC 22.0 (SPSS
Inc.) and GraphPad Prism.
Results
Patient Characteristics
Patient characteristics and data on surgical and transfusion
variables are summarized in ►Table 1.
VWF and sCD163 Levels
We measured levels of VWF and sCD163 in serum samples in
168 patients for whom a serum sample was available. The
median VWF level was 37.5 µg/mL (IQR 23.6–58.9) and the
median sCD163 level was 1,330 ng/mL (IQR 761–2189).
There was a significant linear correlation between VWF￾and sCD163-levels, and both markers also correlated with
the MELD score (►Table 2).
Increased Blood Loss and RBC Transfusion in Patients
with High Levels of VWF and sCD163
We analyzed blood loss and RBC transfusion requirements in
patients with high or low levels of VWF and sCD163 as
defined in earlier sections. Patients with high serum levels
of VWF or sCD163 had significantly increased blood loss and
RBC transfusion requirements compared with patients with
low levels of these markers. In addition, patients with a high
preoperative INR had increased blood loss and RBC transfu￾sion requirements (►Figs. 1 and 2).
When patients had a combination of a high INR and high
VWF or sCD163 levels, blood loss and RBC transfusion
requirements were higher as compared with those patients
with a low INR and high VWF or sCD163 levels and vice versa
(►Table 3). Also, a combination of high VWF and high sCD163
levels was associated with increased blood loss and RBC
transfusion requirements as compared with low levels of
either or both VWF and sCD163. Finally, a combination of
high MELD score and high VWF or sCD163 levels was
associated with higher blood loss and RBC transfusion
requirements compared with patients with low MELD and
high VWF or sCD163 levels and vice versa.

More Transfusion Free-OLT in Patients with Low Levels
of VWF and sCD163
The proportion of patients undergoing OLT without the
requirement for RBC transfusion was 43% with low levels
of VWF compared with 18% in the group of patients with high
levels of VWF. This translates to a more than threefold
increased risk of receiving RBCs in patients with high pre￾operative VWF levels (OR 3.4 [95% CI 1.7–7.0]). The propor￾tion of patients that did not require RBC transfusion was 39%
with low preoperative levels of sCD163 versus 22% in those
with high sCD163 levels (OR 2.3 [95% CI 1.1–4.5]). Patients

with a low preoperative INR were also more likely not to
require RBC transfusion compared with those with high
preoperative INR levels (44 vs. 22%, OR 2.8 [95% CI 1.4–5.8]).
More Massive Transfusions in Patients with High
Levels of VWF and sCD163
The proportion of patients undergoing OLT with the require￾ment for 6 or more units of RBC (i.e., a massive transfusion)
was 13% in the low VWF group compared with 36% in the
high VWF group. This translates to an almost fourfold
increased risk of a massive transfusion in patients with
high VWF levels (OR 3.9 [95% CI 1.8–8.3]). Similarly, 15% of
the patients in the low sCD163 group required massive
transfusion, compared with 34% in the high sCD163 group,
OR 2.9 (95% CI 1.4–5.8).
Discussion
Our data show that patients with high preoperative levels of
VWF and sCD163, which are established makers for portal
hypertension, have a significantly higher risk for RBC trans￾fusion, experience more blood loss, and require more RBC
transfusions compared with patients with low values of
these markers. High preoperative INR values and a combina￾tion of a high INR and high levels of VWF or sCD163 also
constitute an increased risk for bleeding and RBC transfu￾sion. Thus, perioperative blood loss appears to be dependent
on a combination of severity of liver dysfunction or derange￾ment in hemostasis (as indicated by the INR), and portal
hypertension (assessed by serum levels of VWF and sCD163).
Although portal hypertension is increasingly considered a
prime determinant of blood loss during OLT, this study is to
our knowledge the first to link established markers for portal
hypertension with intraoperative blood loss. In addition, the
results of our study suggest an interaction between portal
hypertension and the extent of liver synthetic dysfunction in
determining bleeding risk.
Although serum levels of VWF and sCD163 correlated
moderately well, blood loss was clearly higher in those
patients with elevated levels of both markers compared
with patients with elevated levels of only one of the two.
As VWF and sCD163 assess distinct consequences of portal
hypertension (i.e., activation of endothelial cells and Kupffer
cells, respectively), it may be that the combination of these
two markers is a better predictor of the extent of portal
hypertension than the levels of either one.

Whether the association between INR and blood loss in
our study indicates a role for preexisting coagulopathy in
bleeding during OLT is uncertain. The INR represents the
deficiency in procoagulant proteins in cirrhosis and does not
reflect the net hemostatic balance in cirrhosis.22 We have
previously demonstrated intact hemostatic capacity in sam￾ples taken at various time points during OLT despite pro￾found prolongations in the INR, which we explained by a
concomitant decline in pro- and anticoagulants, whereas the
INR is only sensitive for alterations in procoagulant pro￾teins.11 It thus appears more plausible that the relation
between preoperative INR and blood loss reflects severity
of disease. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that, although
the patients with elevated INR remain in hemostatic balance,
those patients are more susceptible to bleeding as the
hemostatic balance is less stable in those patients with
severe deficiencies in both pro- and anticoagulant proteins.
It may be that improvement of the hemostatic status by
infusion of low-volume prohemostatics, such as prothrom￾bin complex concentrates, helps in further reducing periop￾erative blood loss. Such low-volume products lack the
increase in portal hypertension associated with infusion of
fresh frozen plasma. Anecdotal clinical experience supports
the use of low-volume products over blood components.23
A limitation of our study is that the serum samples used
were collected without a strict timing protocol. We studied
samples that were taken anywhere from 0 up to 30 days prior
to OLT, and assumed levels of VWF and sCD163 in these
samples to reflect the extent of portal hypertension at the
time of surgery. VWF antigen levels are generally assessed in
(citrated) plasma, but we only had stored serum samples
available for analyses, which is another limitation of our
analyses. It has been established that VWF antigen levels are
somewhat lower in serum compared with plasma,24 and that
in serum particularly the high molecular weight multimers
are lower,25 presumably due to entrapment in the clot.
Additionally, we did not directly relate our serum markers
of portal hypertension to clinical markers of portal hyper￾tension or to direct measures such as HVPGs as these data
were not available. Future studies in this setting should
therefore assess VWF levels in plasma, preferably by auto￾mated methods available in diagnostic laboratories, and
relate these to both direct measures of portal hypertension
and intraoperative transfusion requirements.
Conclusion
We have shown increased blood loss and transfusion
requirements during OLT, in patients with elevated levels
of established markers of portal hypertension. These results
provide evidence for the contribution of portal hypertension
in the increased bleeding risk in cirrhotic patients undergo￾ing OLT and support a restrictive transfusion policy and
perioperative interventions that decrease or prevent further
aggravation of portal hypertension.
