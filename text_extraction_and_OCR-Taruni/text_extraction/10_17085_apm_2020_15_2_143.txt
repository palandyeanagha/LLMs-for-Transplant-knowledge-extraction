INTRODUCTION 
As the liver plays an important role in the blood coagula￾tion system, hepatic dysfunction could lead to coagulopa￾thy. Even during hepatic failure, the coagulation system 
can maintain a balance via various mechanisms, but it is 
not stable. Most patients undergoing liver transplantation 
experience severe changes in blood coagulation status 
during surgery that results in bleeding tendency. Because 
excessive bleeding and blood transfusion during liver 
transplantations are risk factors for patients’ poor out￾comes [1], it is important to rapidly perceive and manage 
the changes of the blood coagulation status to prevent ex￾cessive bleeding and reduce blood transfusion during sur￾gery. Conventional coagulation test (CCT) to diagnose co￾agulation disorders includes tests for bleeding time (BT), 
prothrombin time (PT), activated partial prothrombin time

(aPTT), thrombin time (TT), platelet count, and fibrinogen. 
However, studies have reported that it is difficult to predict 
the possibility of bleeding or blood transfusion with CCT 
[2–4] and that CCT is insufficient to distinguish whether a 
coagulopathy has occurred [5,6]. Furthermore, CCT has 
the disadvantage of being time-consuming, and hence, it 
cannot be applied in situations that require rapid judgment 
and treatment. Recently, viscoelastic coagulation test has 
been garnering attention as a method that can overcome 
these limitations [7]. This test was developed in 1948 and 
approved for use in enabling targeted treatment by distin￾guishing deficient coagulation factors in patients with co￾agulation factor deficiencies. Since the 1960s, cases of 
perioperative applications have been reported. Viscoelastic 
coagulation test is a method to determine coagulation in 
real-time by obtaining the thromboelastrography while the 
blood coagulation is in process. It is reported that this test 
Coagulation and transfusion management in patients undergoing liver transplantation is 
challenging. Proper perioperative monitoring of hemostasis is essential to predict the risk of 
bleeding during surgery, to detect potential causes of hemorrhage in time, and to guide he￾mostatic therapy. The value of conventional coagulation test is questionable in the acute 
perioperative setting due to their long turnaround time and the inability to adequately reflect 
the complex changes in hemostasis in patients with liver disease. Viscoelastic coagulation 
tests provide simultaneous measurement of multiple aspects of whole-blood coagulation in￾cluding plasmatic coagulation and fibrinolytic factors and inhibitors that reflect most aspects 
of hemostasis. Coagulation initiation, mechanical clot stability, and fibrinolysis can be esti￾mated immediately using point-of-care techniques. Therefore, viscoelastic coagulation tests 
including ROTEM & TEG would be useful to guide patient blood management strategy during 
liver transplantation.

can provide a more comprehensive and accurate informa￾tion about coagulation function than conventional tests [8]. 
Other than the platelet count, most CCTs are plasma-based 
tests and can only reflect the initial stages of the coagula￾tion. In contrast, viscoelastic coagulation tests are plasma 
and cell-based tests using the whole blood and can provide 
information from coagulation initiation to fibrinolysis, the 
strength and stability of the clot. Therefore, it provides a 
real time accurate biological representation of coagulation 
[6] and can be used as a point-of-care testing. The visco￾elastic coagulation test is often applied to patients under￾going surgery for trauma in which bleeding can be prob￾lematic, and various studies on its utility has been con￾ducted. And there are many studies have been conducted 
on its use during liver transplantation recently. Therefore, 
this review article aims to examine the usefulness of the 
viscoelastic coagulation test and its application in liver 
transplantation. 
VISCOELASTIC COAGULATION TEST 
Viscoelastic coagulation test is a method that measures, 
digitalizes, and graphically plots the viscoelasticity gener￾ated between the fibrin strands and the platelets in the 
process of blood coagulation. There are currently two 
types of equipment that can be used for viscoelastic coag￾ulation test: classical thrombelastography (TEG, Haemon￾etics, USA) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM, 
Tem International GmbH, Germany). The parameter that 
can be obtained first through these tests is the clotting 
time (clotting time or CT in ROTEM; reaction time or R in 
TEG) which is the time it takes until the graph amplitude 
reaches 2 mm. This can be considered an index of the co￾agulation factor function. Delay in this parameter can sig￾nal coagulation factor deficiency or dysfunction. The next 
parameter is the amount of time it takes for the amplitude 
to increase from 2 mm to 20 mm which is referred to as the 
clot formation time (clot formation time or CFT in RO￾TEM; k in TEG), and this reflects fibrin formation. Platelet 
response is considered to start at this time, and the slope 
of the graph until this point is represented as the a angle. 
Then, the amplitude gradually increases and reaches max￾imum. This maximum amplitude (maximum clot firmness 
or MCF in ROTEM; maximum amplitude or MA in TEG) is 
an index that reflects the strength of the clot. To quickly 
assess the strength of the clot, estimates can be made from 
the amplitudes measured at the 5, 10, and 20 min after the 
clotting time. The final parameter represents the fibrinoly￾sis. The amplitude 30 min or 60 min after clotting time is 
calculated as a percentage of the maximum amplitude 
(LI30, LI60 in ROTEM; LY30, LY60 in TEG) to represent the 
stability of the clot (Fig. 1). Because the activators used in 
the two equipment are slightly different, the reference 
ranges are different. 
The types of tests that can be performed with TEG in￾clude Native and Kaolin TEG as the basic tests, Rapid TEG 
which enables quick response by inducing responses with 
the tissue factors, heparinase method that shows results by 
removing the effects of heparin, and Heparinase method 
that shows results by removing the effects of heparin, and

Functional Fibrinogen (FF) which shows the fibrin func￾tions. In addition, the platelet function test is added. The 
tests that can be performed with ROTEM include NATEM 
which is a basic test that adds calcium to the citrated blood. 
The remaining tests can be classified into two types: EX￾TEM group and INTEM group. EXTEM is a method of mak￾ing the response speed faster by activating the coagulation 
process using the tissue factors. Through this method, the 
extrinsic pathway of the coagulation can be identified. By 
adding aprotinin to this test and inhibiting fibrinolysis, AP￾TEM can be obtained. By adding cytochalasin D and inhib￾iting platelet functions, FIBTEM can be performed. The 
other family of tests is INTEM by which the intrinsic path￾way of the blood coagulation can be identified by adding 
ellagic acid. HEPTEM can be performed by adding hepari￾nase and neutralizing the effect of heparin (Table 1). A test 
that can separately assess the platelet coagulation is soon 
to be commercialized. Both TEG and ROTEM were previ￾ously used by putting the blood in the testing cup and at￾taching it to the machine, the convenience of testing has in￾creased presently with the introduction of the cartridge-type 
models. 
Although the reference ranges of clotting time varies be￾tween testing equipment and method, plasma coagulation 
factor deficiency can generally be assessed within 5 min. 
Abnormal clot strength can be assessed within 25 min if 
the values at 5, 10, or 20 min after clotting time are used 
before the maximum amplitude is observed. Additionally, 
by interpreting the amplitude results of FIBTEM or FF to￾gether, we could discriminate between the fibrin and plate￾let function or quantity problems. Although it can take 
more than one hour to completely assess the state of fibri￾nolysis, prediction can be made within 35 min if the abnor￾mal fibrinolysis is severe by referencing the values at 30 
min after the clotting time. In other words, using the visco￾elastic coagulation test enables the assessment of the ur￾gent need for fresh frozen plasma within 5 min, the need 
for fibrin or platelet supplement other than the coagulation 
factors and the risk of bleeding within 25 min. 
NECESSITY AND ADVANTAGES OF 
VISCOELASTIC COAGULATION TEST FOR 
LIVER TRANSPLANTATION 
Because patients undergoing liver transplantation have 
severely reduced liver functions, they are unable to gener￾ate sufficient amounts of vitamin K-dependent procoagu￾lants, protein C, and protein S, which play important roles

in coagulation. Furthermore, they simultaneously show 
decreased alpha-2-antiplasmin, thrombin activatable fibri￾nolysis inhibitor (TAFI), and plasminogen and increased 
tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen acti￾vator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) which must be removed by the liv￾er. Besides deficiency in liver functions, decrease in platelet 
count and its functions can be observed due to spleen en￾largement and bone marrow suppression in patients with 
liver diseases. In addition, decrease in fibrinogen and its 
functions are common. These changes in the coagula￾tion-related substances maintain an equilibrium but are 
unstable. Therefore, coagulopathy disorders and the result￾ing worsening of bleeding during liver transplantation is 
common. Because pre-operative CCT only reflects the 
pro-coagulant aspects of the plasma, it cannot provide ac￾curate information, and the results are not related to the 
volume of bleeding or the transfusion of blood products 
during liver transplantation. Thus, it is difficult to predict 
bleeding or the need for blood transfusion [9,10]. Further￾more, because there are severe changes in the state of co￾agulation among the stages of surgery during liver trans￾plantation, perioperative real-time monitoring is more im￾portant than the results from pre-operative tests. CCT re￾quires the process of obtaining blood and sending it to a 
diagnostic lab, and generally 45–90 min are required to ob￾tain the results. Therefore, CCT is not suitable for point-of￾care testing during liver transplantation. In contrast, the 
viscoelastic coagulation test enables point-of-care testing. 
It can lessen the burden of sending the blood to the lab, as 
long as the testing equipment is available, and generally 
15–25 min are sufficient to obtain the main results for treat￾ment. Therefore, it enables real-time monitoring and 
goal-directed therapy [11]. Although it can take 60–90 min 
to obtain all results, only few minutes are necessary to pre￾dict an immediate coagulopathy and clinically assess the 
need for treatment and the type of treatment. Many studies 
suggest that the viscoelastic coagulation test is more sensi￾tive to coagulation disorders than CCT [12,13]. Moreover, 
in vivo studies on liver transplantation showed that pre-op￾erative ROTEM test results are good predictors of the need 
for blood transfusion, particularly the need for fresh frozen 
plasma blood transfusion [14]. A retrospective analysis of 
patients undergoing liver transplantation reported that the 
MCF was strongly correlated with platelet count and fibrin 
concentration, and thus, can replace conventional tests 
[15]. In particular, because the amplitude obtained 5 or 10 
min after the clotting time reflect the decrease in platelet or 
fibrin concentration, a quick assessment of the clot 
strength is possible [16]. Additionally, the viscoelastic test 
showed better results than CCT in predicting bleeding after 
the liver transplantation due to pathologic coagulopathy 
[17]. Thus, viscoelastic test is often used to test the coagu￾lation function of the patients undergoing liver transplan￾tation. It was reported in the 1980s by the University of 
Pittsburgh that blood transfusion can be decreased by ap￾plying TEG during liver transplantation [18]. A decrease in 
the transfusion of fresh frozen plasma by applying the 
transfusion strategy using this viscoelastic coagulation test 
for liver transplantation was also reported recently [19]. 
Because this test enables the immediate assessment of the 
state of fibrinolysis which cannot be obtained through 
CCT, it is suggested that transfusion may be decreased if 
the viscoelastic coagulation test is applied for liver trans￾plantation where hyperfibrinolysis commonly occurs [20]. 
Depending on the type of the liver diseases that caused 
the hepatic failure, the state of coagulopathy may differ 
among patients undergoing liver transplantation. For ex￾ample, patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, cholestatic 
hepatitis, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) show 
a relative hypercoagulation. In these patients, thrombosis 
is as important as bleeding. Although the prevalence of 
thrombosis is not high in Korea, liver disease and liver 
transplantation are clear risk factors for thromboembolism. 
Even if there is a bleeding tendency due to a coagulopathy, 
the risk of thrombosis does not decrease [21]. Furthermore, 
patients undergoing organ transplantation have a risk of fi￾brinolytic shutdown [22], and this is reported to increase 
the risk of thrombosis and bleeding during surgery. Krzan￾icki et al. [23] showed that many patients suffer from hyper￾coagulation during liver transplantation. Data on the re￾sulting pulmonary embolism in liver transplantation 
showed that although the incidence was not high, the mor￾tality rate was high, and it was particularly common just 
before or after graft reperfusion [24]. Therefore, diagnosing 
hypercoagulation state during liver transplantation is an 
important issue. According to the prospective study by Mc￾Crath et al. [25], the increase in MA is an independent pre￾dictive factor for post-operative acute myocardial infarc￾tion. Another research using ROTEM by Hincker et al. [26] 
showed that the increase in MCF can predict thrombosis. 
This emphasizes the need for viscoelastic coagulation test 
in liver transplantation. 
However, some studies reported that there were no dif￾ferences in bleeding or blood transfusion before and after

studies vary, it is difficult to conclude which method was 
the best. Additionally, the reference values of viscoelastic 
coagulation test are just average values of healthy subjects. 
Thus, values that are outside of this range does not neces￾sarily suggest a coagulation disorder. Because values out￾side the reference range is not directly linked to bleeding, it 
is difficult to make a protocol based on the test values. In 
particular, in situations such as liver transplantations in 
which the state of coagulation changes rapidly, it is not ap￾propriate to perform treatment based only on test results, 
and it is essential to consider the clinical situation. Re￾search on patients undergoing liver transplantation 
showed that the predicted cut-off values of risk for bleeding 
or blood transfusion were within the reference range which 
further emphasized that treatment decisions based only on 
test results are inappropriate [14]. 
Severe fluctuations in the coagulation status appear at 
each phase of liver transplantation surgery (Fig. 2). Defi￾ciency or functional decline in blood coagulation factor 
and platelet is typical for the preanhepatic phase. There￾fore, thin graphs with extended R and CT and low values of 
MA and MCF are common. Because it better reflects the 
balanced coagulation state, stable results can be seen on 
the viscoelastic test even in patients with severe coagulop￾athy according to the CCT in the beginning of the surgery. 
On the other hand, with the progression of the surgery, the 
worsening of the coagulopathy can be observed in re￾al-time by viscoelastic test. Therefore, while unnecessary 
plasma transfusion is possible when using only the pallia￾tive coagulation test results in the beginning of the surgery, 
this can be prevented by applying the viscoelastic coagula￾tion test and a treatment can be performed when it is really 
needed. In the anhepatic phase, the previously mentioned 
coagulopathy worsens and tPA is not eliminated, and thus, 
hyperfibrinolysis can occur. Thus, LI30, LI60, LY30, and 
LY60 increase or worsen. Here, an appropriate administra￾tion of an anti-fibrinolysis medication (tranexamic acid) 
can prevent the worsening of bleeding. In particular, all 
previously discussed coagulation disorders worsen at the 
end of the anhepatic phase and immediately after reperfu￾sion, due to the increase in tPA and PAI-1, decrease in al￾pha-2-antiplasmin, and the influx of heparin-like sub￾stances in the donated liver [33–35]. Although coagulopa￾thy is observed in combination, referencing the changes in 
each value and the results of fibrinogen and platelet func￾tions from the viscoelastic test can be of much help in as￾sessing the most urgently needed treatment. In the neohe￾using this coagulation testing [27]. It can be difficult to defi￾nitely conclude whether applying the viscoelastic coagula￾tion test to the blood transfusion strategy during liver 
transplantation can really improve patient prognosis. How￾ever, this test has the clear advantage of reflecting the over￾all process of coagulation, from clot formation to fibrinoly￾sis, and it can more sensitively and accurately diagnose co￾agulopathy than CCT during the surgery. For this reason, 
the application of viscoelastic coagulation test for liver 
transplantation can reduce bleeding and blood transfu￾sion. Therefore, the Korean guideline for perioperative 
blood transfusion [28] and the guideline by the American 
Society of Anesthesiologists [29] consider the blood trans￾fusion strategies using TEG and ROTEM to be important 
for not only liver transplantation but also perioperative 
blood management. Moreover, the guidelines for manage￾ment of severe perioperative bleeding published by the 
European Society of Anaesthesiology [30] state that CCT is 
not suitable for surgeries in patients with liver disease and 
recommend TEG or ROTEM to diagnose perioperative co￾agulation disorders. Although further study is necessary, 
this recommendation based on that, viscoelastic coagula￾tion test can improve prognosis by reducing blood transfu￾sion, facilitate targeted management and can identify hy￾perfibrinolysis. 
BLOOD TRANSFUSION STRATEGY USING 
VISCOELASTIC COAGULATION TEST FOR 
LIVER TRANSPLANTATION 
To date, there is no protocol that applies viscoelastic co￾agulation test, which was found to be clearly superior as 
blood transfusion strategies for liver transplantation. A 
protocol published in 1993 [18] recommended the transfu￾sion of 2–4 units of fresh frozen plasma if R time, which re￾flects the start of coagulation, is delayed by 15 minutes or 
more; transfusion of 1 unit/10 kg of platelet if MA, which 
reflects the clot strength, is thinner than 40 mm; and trans￾fusion of 6–12 units of cryoprecipitate if these blood trans￾fusions do not improve blood coagulation or if the a angle 
is less than 40 degrees. Findings from research in 2012 
showed that using higher TEG threshold for blood transfu￾sion than suggested in this protocol did not increase bleed￾ing [31]. Because there are large variances in the indicators 
of the coagulation test during liver transplantation, the 
protocols of the tests are significantly related but not highly 
consistent [32]. Moreover, since protocols applied in the

Viscoelastic coagulation test for liver transplantation

patic phase, the coagulopathy can improve due to the 
functions of the transplanted liver, and this is reflected in 
the viscoelastic coagulation test results. If the coagulopathy 
appears unchanged or worsened according to the visco￾elastic coagulation test in this phase, the possibility of ex￾cessive bleeding must be considered even if this is a gener￾ally stable period; in addition, the possibility that the trans￾planted liver is dysfunctional must be considered as well. 
CONCLUSION 
Viscoelastic coagulation test is a point-of-care testing 
that can show not only the beginning of the coagulation 
but also the clot strength and stability. It enables faster 
judgment and treatment than CCT. As its utility has already 
been shown in clinical situations with coagulation disor￾ders and severe bleeding such as trauma using both clini￾cal and academic studies, this method can be used effec￾tively for liver transplantation which has a high risk of 
bleeding. Through further research, it is anticipated that 
this test can be used as one of the standardized patient 
blood management strategies for liver transplantation.
