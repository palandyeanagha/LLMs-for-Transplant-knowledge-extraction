Abstract. Circulating levels of calcium ion (Ca2+) are maintained within a narrow physiological
range mainly by the action of parathyroid hormone (PTH) secreted from parathyroid cells.
Parathyroid cells can sense small fluctuations in plasma Ca2+ levels by virtue of a cell surface
Ca2+ receptor (CaR) that belongs to the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors. Calcimimetics
are positive allosteric modulators that activate the CaR on parathyroid cells and thereby
immediately suppress PTH secretion. Pre-clinical studies with NPS R-568, a first generation
calcimimetic compound, have demonstrated that daily oral administration inhibits the elevation
of plasma PTH levels and parathyroid gland hyperplasia and ameliorates impaired bone qualities
in rats with chronic renal insufficiency. The results of clinical trials with cinacalcet hydro￾chloride, a second generation calcimimetic compound, have shown that calcimimetics possess
lowering effects not only on serum PTH levels but also on serum calcium  phosphorus product
levels, a hallmark of an increased risk for cardiovascular death in dialysis patients with end-stage
renal disease (ESRD). Thus, calcimimetics have considerable potential as an innovative medical
approach to manage secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with ESRD. Indeed, cinacalcet
hydrochloride has been approved in several countries and is the first positive allosteric modulator
of any G protein-coupled receptor to reach the market.

Introduction
Intracellular calcium ion (Ca2+), as a key intracellular
second messenger, plays a pivotal role in controlling
cellular processes such as secretion, differentiation,
growth, motility, and mortality. On the other hand,
extracellular Ca2+ is crucial for a spectrum of physio￾logical phenomena, including blood coagulation, neuro￾transmitter release, myocardial function, and mainte￾nance of skeletal integrity. Upon activation, cells
undergo rapid changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentra￾tion ([Ca2+]i), whereas extracellular Ca2+ concentration
([Ca2+]e) is maintained within a narrow physiological
range (1.1 – 1.3 mM). Circulating levels of Ca2+ are
controlled mostly by vitamin D and parathyroid hor￾mone (PTH). PTH is secreted from parathyroid cells and
acts on the bone, the kidney, and indirectly through
vitamin D, the small intestine to mobilize Ca2+ into the
extracellular fluid. The secretion of PTH is decreased by
increases in [Ca2+]e so that there is a reciprocal relation￾ship between PTH and Ca2+ levels (1).
It was proposed in 1986 that parathyroid cells possess
a cell surface “Ca2+ receptor” (CaR) that enables these
cells to detect and respond to small changes in [Ca2+]e
(2). This CaR was cloned in 1993 and shown to belong
to the super family of G-protein-coupled receptors *Corresponding author. FAX: 027-347-5280

(GPCRs) (3). In it’s structural and functional properties,
the CaR is like other GPCRs, with the exception being
that its physiological ligand is an atom rather than a
molecule.
In parallel with these efforts aimed at cloning the
CaR were those aimed at identifying small organic
compounds that activate the CaR (4). Fendiline, a
phenylalkylamine derivative, was found to activate the
CaR, and modification of this prototype molecule
resulted in the identification of the first-generation
calcimimetic compounds exemplified by NPS R-568 (5)
(Fig. 1). Compounds that activate the CaR and inhibit
PTH secretion are termed “calcimimetics” (4). With
calcimimetics, it has become possible for the first time
to alter the functions of the CaR pharmacologically to
achieve therapeutic benefits.
In this review, we will discuss some properties of
the CaR and then focus on the preclinical data for NPS
R-568 and the clinical data for cinacalcet hydrochloride
(cinacalcet, referred to as KRN1493 in Japan) (Fig. 1), a
second-generation calcimimetic compound, for second￾ary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) associated with end￾stage renal disease (ESRD).
CaR
Characteristic features of the CaR
The CaR belongs to a subfamily of GPCR, family C,
which includes metabotropic glutamate receptors
(mGluRs), GABAB receptors, and putative pheromone
and taste receptors (6). The human (1,078 amino acids)
and bovine (1,085 amino acids) CaRs are glycosylated
proteins of approximately 120 kda and are 93%
identical. The CaR has a large extracellular domain
(ECD) (e.g., 612 and 613 amino acids in human and
bovine CaR, respectively), seven membrane-spanning
segments, and a relatively large cytoplasmic domain.
This large ECD is topologically related to the Venus
flytrap structure of bacterial periplasmic binding pro￾teins and exhibits several clusters of acidic amino acid
residues that interact with Ca2+ in the millimolar range
through electrostatic interactions.
Activation of the CaR stimulates phospholipase C,
which results in increased levels of inositol 1,4,5-
trisphosphate (IP3), which in turn elevates [Ca2+]i by
mobilizing Ca2+ from its intracellular stores (4). The
CaR is also coupled to adenylate cyclase via a hetero￾trimeric Gi protein and activation of the receptor lowers
intracellular accumulation of cAMP. Recent work has
suggested that the mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) cascade activated via either of two routes,
protein kinase C (PKC) and Gi-linked tyrosine kinase
pathways, stimulates the phosphorylation of cytosolic
phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) (7). In fact, in vitro studies
demonstrated that high [Ca2+]e increased the release of
free arachidonic acid and the addition of free arachi￾donic acid or its further metabolites suppressed PTH
secretion from porcine parathyroid cells (8, 9).
CaR ligands
While Ca2+ is the physiological ligand for the CaR, it
is known that the CaR can also sense and respond to
other divalent and polyvalent cations including Mg2+,
Be2+, Ba2+, Sr2+, La3+, Gd3+, and even organic polycations
such as spermine, hexacyclin, polylysine, polyarginine,
protamine, amyloid -peptides, neomycin, and genta￾micin (4). The lack of selectivity and relatively low
potency of these cations for the CaR indicate that
charged residues in the ECD of the CaR are critical for
receptor activation through electrostatic interactions.
Although not perfect, a correlation exists between the
potencies of cations at the CaR and their net positive
charge density. In addition, recent studies indicate the
possibility that the CaRs act as sensors for pH (10) and
L-amino acids (11). Indeed, L-amino acids suppress PTH
secretion in vitro, suggesting that L-amino acids are
physiological regulators of PTH secretion and whole
body calcium metabolism (11).
Tissue distribution of the CaR
Data accumulated since the cloning of the CaR have
indicated that the CaR is expressed not only in organs
controlling [Ca2+]e homeostasis (e.g., parathyroid glands,
thyroid C-cells, kidney, bone, and intestine) but also in
a variety of other tissues apparently not involved in
systemic mineral ion homeostasis such as brain,
epidermis, lens, stomach, pancreas, liver, breast, ovary,

placenta, prostate, testis, and bone marrow cells (12).
Despite limited understanding of the functional signifi￾cance of the CaR outside of the system governing
mineral ion homeostasis, the CaRs on these cells
probably act as a regulator of diverse cellular functions,
including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, gene
expression, intercellular communication, and mainte￾nance of membrane potential. On the other hand,
Quarles has brought up a possibility that CaR’s presence
in some of these tissues may be vestigial, based on the
clinical observation of CaR hereditary disorders and the
selective pharmacological effects of calcimimetics (13).
CaR-related human diseases
Cloning of the CaR was immediately followed by the
identification of inherited genetic human [Ca2+]e-sensing
disorders resulting from the CaR gene mutations (14).
Positional cloning approaches have clarified that loss-of￾function mutations of the CaR cause familial hypo￾calciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) and neonatal severe
hyperparathyroidism (NSHPT). Moreover, resemblance
of phenotypes between these two diseases and CaR
knockout mice provides compelling evidence that FHH
and NSHPT are caused by hetero- and homozygous
mutations of the CaR, respectively (15). In contrast,
gain-of-function mutation of CaR causes autosomal
dominant hypocalcemia (ADH). These observations
support the critical role of the CaR to maintain [Ca2+]e
homeostasis in mammals.
It has been suggested that sensitivity of parathyroid
[Ca2+]e-sensing is reduced in patients with primary and
secondary HPT. In these patients, however, any muta￾tion of the CaR at least in the coding region has not
been reported so far. In these patients with hyperplastic
parathyroid glands, reduced expression of the CaR at
both mRNA and protein levels (16, 17) may contribute
to blunted [Ca2+]e-sensing. In addition, it has been
reported that acquired HPT with similar clinical
manifestation to FHH occurs by auto-antibodies against
the CaR with the exception of parathyroid cell destruc￾tion by auto-antibodies (18).
Pre-clinical studies of NPS R-568
Binding site
While Ca2+, a physiological ligand, binds at the ECD
of the CaR (the orthosteric site), chimera receptor
analyses between CaR and mGluRs have shown that
the binding site of phenylalkylamine calcimimetic
compounds is localized to the transmembrane domain
of the CaR (19, 20).
In vitro properties
The most prominent action of NPS R-568, a first￾generation calcimimetic compound, involves inhibiting
PTH secretion from parathyroid cells. The effect of NPS
R-568 on the CaR is dose-dependent; however, in the
absence of extracellular Ca2+, the activity of these
calcimimetics is abolished. NPS R-568 increases [Ca2+]i
associated with an increase in cytoplasmic IP3 levels in
HEK293 cells expressing the human CaR, whereas
NPS R-568 has no effects in wild-type HEK293 cells,
confirming that the specific target of this compound is
the CaR (21). In addition, NPS R-568 does not interact
with other known GPCRs such as the ATP receptor,
thrombin receptor, bradykinin receptor, substance K
receptor, and mGluRs, indicating that this compound
has high selectivity for the CaR (5).
In vivo properties
Single oral administration of NPS R-568 decreases
plasma levels of [Ca2+]e and PTH (21) and transiently
increases calcitonin (22) levels in normal rats. Abroga￾tion of the hypocalcemic effect in thyroparathyroidecto￾mized rats indicates that both PTH and calcitonin
contribute to hypocalcemia caused by NPS R-568 (22).
NPS R-568, however, is 40-times less potent in increas￾ing plasma levels of calcitonin than in decreasing those
of PTH in normal rats.
Parathyroid cell functions
Secondary HPT, characterized by parathyroid hyper￾plasia, is one of the most common consequences of
ESRD (23). Initiated during the early stages of ESRD
and associated with high levels of serum PTH, para￾thyroid hyperplasia is rarely reversible and often
progresses in the long term to refractory forms charac￾terized by diffuse or nodular hyperplasia.
NPS R-568 can reduce the number of S-phase cells
labeled by 5-bromodeoxyuridine in partially nephrecto￾mized rats (24). This effect of NPS R-568 is independent
of changes in serum levels of active vitamin D or
phosphorus. These results indicate that activation of the
CaR is linked to anti-proliferation in parathyroid cells.
Indeed, long term treatment with NPS-R-568 can
suppress the parathyroid hyperplasia to the baseline
levels in rats with progressive chronic renal insuffi￾ciency (25, 26). However, there have been no data that
calcimimetics can regress the parathyroid hyperplasia
because calcimimetics do not cause any apoptosis in
parathyroid cells.
Bone effects
Osteitis fibrosa is a prevalent bone disease in patients
with secondary HPT that is characterized by increased

358 N Nagano and EF Nemeth
bone resorption, extensive osteoblastic activity, and
bone marrow fibrosis (27). Treatment with NPS R-568
for 30 days in partially nephrectomized rats ameliorates
osteitis fibrosa accompanied by an increase in cortical
bone strength (28). Correlation analysis suggests that
NPS R-568 exerts its beneficial bone effects primarily
by normalizing serum PTH levels. In addition, we have
suggested that oscillations in plasma PTH levels
achieved by daily oral administration of NPS R-568
can increase bone volume in rats with low-turnover bone
and osteomalacia (29).
Clinical studies of cinacalcet
Clinical studies demonstrated that NPS R-568
effectively lowered blood levels of PTH in dialysis
patients with secondary HPT. In this respect, this first￾generation calcimimetic compound provided the proof
of concept for the therapeutic potential of calcimimetics
in medical science. Unfortunately, the clinical develop￾ment of NPS R-568 was discontinued owing to its
pharmacokinetic properties: the bioavailability of this
compound is low and it is mainly metabolized by the
highly polymorphic cytochrome P450 enzyme, CYP2D6.
The clinical development of a calcimimetic compound
has continued with cinacalcet, a secondgeneration
compound with improved pharmacokinetic properties.
Efficacy for secondary HPT
Several clinical trials have demonstrated that cinacalcet
effectively lowers blood PTH levels in dialysis patients
that are already being treated with phosphate-binders
and with active vitamin D or its analogs (30 – 33). The
lowering effect on serum PTH levels has been observed
independently of severity of secondary HPT (i.e., basal
serum PTH levels), serum phosphate levels, dialysis
composition, or usage of vitamin D and phosphate
binder. Preliminary results in a small study involving
bone biopsies suggest that 1-year treatment with
cinacalcet decreases bone turnover and bone marrow
fibrosis in dialysis patients (34). In addition, cinacalcet
treatment for 6 or 12 months significantly decreased
the risk of parathyroidectomy and bone fractures by
retrospective analysis of 5 clinical studies with 1184
dialysis patients (35).
In addition to the lowering effect on serum PTH
levels, long-term clinical trials have indicated that
cinacalcet decreases serum calcium  phosphorus
product levels (31 – 33). Like a mechanism for hypo￾calcemia as described below, chronic lowered serum
PTH levels by cinacalcet treatment could shift high￾turnover bone under the condition of secondary HPT to
low-turnover bone, resulting in decreased phosphate
mobilization from the bone. Hyperphosphatemia per se
and elevated calcium  phosphorus product levels cause
soft tissue calcification, especially cardiovascular
calcification, and elevate mortality risk of dialysis
patients. Therefore, this favorable calcium  phosphorus
product profile caused by cinacalcet is considered to be
very advantageous. Long-term treatment with cinacalcet
may have potentials to improve quality of life and
decrease hospitalization risk and mortality in patients
with ESRD.
Safety profile
Long-term treatment with cinacalcet in several studies
was generally well tolerated. The two most common
adverse events, hypocalcemia and gastrointestinal side
effects, have been observed in dialysis patients (31 – 33).
Hypocalcemia is considered to be caused by a decreased
Ca2+ mobilization from the bone under the condition of
lowered PTH levels. This hypocalcemia is generally
asymptomatic and easily normalized by calcium-con￾taining phosphate binder or active vitamin D usually
used for dialysis patients. Gastrointestinal side effects
such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain
have been observed, while these events are common in
dialysis patients. The mechanisms are unclear and
further basic and clinical investigations will be needed
since the CaR is expressed in the central nervous
systems and gastrointestinal tracts.
Conclusions
The CaR recognizes extracellular Ca2+ as its physio￾logical ligand. Calcimimetics act at the parathyroid CaR
and can powerfully suppress PTH secretion. The clinical
data demonstrate the profound ability of calcimimetic
compounds to lower the circulating levels of PTH, even
in refractory HPT, which could not be controlled by
conventional therapies. A lowering effect on serum
calcium  phosphorus product is another beneficial
property of calcimimetics in patients on dialysis because
a decreased risk of cardiovascular death would be
expected. Cinacalcet was approved by the US FDA in
March 2004 as a drug (Sensipar®) to treat secondary
HPT in patients on dialysis and hypercalcemia in
patients with parathyroid cancer. In Japan, clinical trials
of cinacalcet have been successfully conducted in
dialysis patients with secondary HPT. Calcimimetics
have considerable potential (Fig. 2), therefore, as an
innovative approach to manage secondary HPT.

characterized by parathyroid hyper functioning. A
prominent effect of calcimimetics is the suppression of
parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion. Calcimimetics
also reduce the proliferating cell number and the
average cell volume of the parathyroid (PT), indicating
the inhibitory effects on a variety of PT cell functions
including PTH synthesis. Furthermore, long-term
treatment with calcimimetics ameliorates osteitis
fibrosa associated with the increases in cortical bone
mineral density and in cortical bone stiffness. A
lowering effect on serum calcium  phosphorus
product is another beneficial property of calcimimetics
because a decreased risk of metastatic calcification
is expected. These beneficial effects are explained by
a chronic reduction in circulating levels of PTH.
