MicroRNA-122 (miR-122), which accounts for 70% of the liver’s total miRNAs, plays a pivotal role in the liver. 
However, its intrinsic physiological roles remain largely undetermined. We demonstrated that mice lacking 
the gene encoding miR-122a (Mir122a) are viable but develop temporally controlled steatohepatitis, fibro￾sis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). These mice exhibited a striking disparity in HCC incidence based 
on sex, with a male-to-female ratio of 3.9:1, which recapitulates the disease incidence in humans. Impaired 
expression of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) contributed to steatosis, which was reversed 
by in vivo restoration of Mttp expression. We found that hepatic fibrosis onset can be partially attributed to 
the action of a miR-122a target, the Klf6 transcript. In addition, Mir122a–/– livers exhibited disruptions in a 
range of pathways, many of which closely resemble the disruptions found in human HCC. Importantly, the 
reexpression of miR-122a reduced disease manifestation and tumor incidence in Mir122a–/– mice. This study 
demonstrates that mice with a targeted deletion of the Mir122a gene possess several key phenotypes of human 
liver diseases, which provides a rationale for the development of a unique therapy for the treatment of chronic 
liver disease and HCC.
Introduction
A growing body of evidence suggests that the spatial and tempo￾ral specificities of microRNAs (miRNAs) are important for tis￾sue specification and cell lineage decisions (1–3). MicroRNA 122 
(miR-122) is a dominant hepatocyte-specific miRNA (1, 4). There 
is a plethora of studies using in vivo gene silencing, in vitro experi￾mentation, and transcriptome profiling that demonstrate how 
miR-122 regulates networks of genes that control lipid metabo￾lism (5, 6), cell differentiation (7), hepatic circadian regulation (8), 
HCV replication (9), and systemic iron homeostasis (10). More￾over, pathogenic repression of miR-122 has been observed in non￾alcoholic steatohepatitis (11), liver cirrhosis (12), and hepatocel￾lular carcinoma (HCC) (12–16). While much is known about the 
broad effects of miR-122 in the adult liver, the intrinsic roles of 
miR-122 in liver physiology have not been formally addressed.
The consequences of miRNA loss in adult livers was recently inves￾tigated using a conditional knockout mouse model that has spe￾cific disruption of Dicer1 in hepatocytes (Albumin-Cre;Dicer1loxp/loxp
mice; Dicer1-KO mice) (17, 18). These mice display a phenotype 
different from that of mice that are administered antisense 
miR-122a oligomers. Specifically, mice with Dicer1-deficient livers 
have steatosis, inflammation, and hepatocyte apoptosis. Impor￾tantly, hepatocarcinogenesis following hepatocyte apoptosis and 
regeneration was observed in one study (18). Taken together, these 
studies demonstrate pivotal roles for the endogenous miRNAs 
found in the liver and support the importance of miR-122 in hepa￾tocyte survival and tumor suppression. However, because multiple 
miRNAs were affected, it is difficult to confirm the specific roles 
that each individual miRNA plays in the Dicer1-deficient liver. 
Therefore, the unique impact of miR-122a repression in the Dicer1-
deficient liver remains undetermined.
To elucidate the physiological roles of miR-122a in the liver, 
we generated a mutant mouse that has a germline deletion of 
Mir122a. Our findings demonstrate that miR-122a is critical for 
the regulation of liver metabolism and hepatocyte differentia￾tion. Spontaneous HCC developed in these mutant mice at a high 
frequency. Previously, we have explored the tumor suppressor 
functions of miR-122 in two xenograft models (15). Our current 
findings unequivocally confirm that Mir122a is an intrinsic tumor 
suppressor gene within the liver.
Results
A Mir122a homozygous mutant mouse strain displays features of steatohepa￾titis and fibrosis. To explore the intrinsic roles of miR-122 in the liver, 
we generated a mutant mouse strain with a germline deletion of 
Mir122a using homologous recombination (ref. 19 and Supplemen￾tal Figure 1; supplemental material available online with this article; 
doi:10.1172/JCI63455DS1). Mice carrying this Mir122a homozy￾gous deletion (hereafter referred to as Mir122a–/– mice) were born at 
the expected Mendelian frequency. All Mir122a–/– mice were fertile 
and otherwise indistinguishable from their WT and heterozygous 
littermates. The presence of a somatic deletion of Mir122a led to 
significant reductions in serum cholesterol and triglyceride (TG) 
levels, but the levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and alanine 
transaminase (ALT) were higher than those of WT mice (Figure 1A).

The fact that Mir122a–/– mice showed reduced serum cholesterol and 
TG levels is in agreement with previous reports studying mice that 
were administered miR-122a antisense oligomers (5, 6). However, 
the reduction in serum cholesterol and TG levels was much great￾er in the Mir122a–/– mice than in the mice administered antisense 
oligomers. Histological examination of the livers of Mir122a–/– mice 
revealed extensive lipid accumulation and reduced glycogen stor￾age (Figure 1B), as well as inflammation and fibrosis, compared 
with WT controls. A strong positive reaction to the anti-F4/80 anti￾body, which is specific for mouse macrophages and monocytes, was 
detected in the Mir122a–/– livers (Figure 1, C and D). Portal fibrosis 
that was due to the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) was 
also detected in the Mir122a–/– livers by staining with Sirius red and 
an anti-desmin antibody (Figure 1, C and F). Portal fibrosis was 
accompanied by elevated expression of two important fibrogenic 
factors, Tgfb1 (20) and Ctgf (ref. 21 and Figure 1E).
Liver steatosis in Mir122a–/– mice is typified by a downregulation of lipid 
metabolism and VLDL secretion. The coincidence of liver steatosis and 
low serum TG and cholesterol levels in the Mir122a–/– mice warrant￾ed an in-depth analysis of hepatic lipid metabolism in these mice. 
The levels of serum HDL and VLDL were significantly reduced in 
the Mir122a–/– mice (Figure 2A), and these events were accompa￾Figure 1

nied by lower levels of serum apoB-100 and apoE (Figure 2B). We 
analyzed the expression of various genes involved in lipid metabo￾lism using reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), and 
we also used lipid profiling to measure the levels of various lipid 
metabolites. Consistent with previous findings (5, 6), we observed 
a general downward trend in the expression of genes involved in 
lipogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, bile acid metabolism, lipid trans￾port, and transcriptional regulation of lipid homeostasis in the 
Mir122a–/– mice, compared with WT mice (Figure 2C). Notably, the 
expression of MTTP (microsomal TG transfer protein) was signifi￾cantly reduced at both the mRNA and protein levels (Figure 2, C and 
D). Lipid profiling by 1H-NMR spectroscopy (22) was performed to 
determine whether there were any differences in the lipid metabolite 
profile of the Mir122a–/– mice. We confirmed the presence of liver 
steatosis in the Mir122a–/– livers based on the significantly increased 
amount of cholesterol (identified by the signal intensity of H-18 at 
0.68 ppm), TG (identified by the signal intensities of the C-1 and C-3 
protons of the TG glycerol skeleton), and phosphatidylcholine (Fig￾ure 2E, Table 1, and Supplemental Table 1). Hepatic VLDL assembly 
and secretion are dependent on the presence of sufficient amounts 
of apoB-100, MTTP, and various lipids (23, 24). We speculate that 
repressed expression of MTTP could contribute to the disturbances 
in the lipid profile that we detected in the Mir122a–/– mice.
The progression of liver diseases in the Mir122a–/– mice is reversible. We 
next investigated whether restoration of Mttp or reexpression of 
miR-122a could reverse liver pathology. A month-long regimen of 
hydrodynamic injection (25) was used to achieve a sustained level 
of MTTP or miR-122a expression in the Mir122a–/– mice. The injec￾tion of Mttp in Mir122a–/– mice resulted in an increase in MTTP 
expression at both the mRNA and the protein levels (Figure 3, A 
and D). Mttp injection also resulted in an increase in serum VLDL 
levels (Figure 3B), as well as in the normalization of the cholesterol 
and fasting TG serum levels (Figure 3C). The MTTP-restored liv￾ers displayed reduced hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis 
(Figure 3D). In contrast to the specific changes induced by Mttp
restoration, the restoration of miR-122a (Supplemental Figure 2B) 
changed a broader spectrum of biological activities, including all 
of the improvements in liver function achieved by Mttp restoration 
(Figure 3, E and F), as well as an elevation of glycogen storage (Fig￾ure 3F) and increased expression of a range of genes involved in

lipid metabolism (Acyl, Fasn, Pklr, and Mttp) (Figure 3G). The res￾toration of miR-122a also conferred antifibrotic potential, because 
significantly fewer HSCs were activated, and the expression of 3 
fibrogenic factors (Ctgf, Klf6, ref. 26; and Tgfb) was reduced (Figure 3, 
F and G). The pattern of low serum TG and high hepatic TG lev￾els found in Mir122a–/– mice seems to indicate impaired MTTP
expression and VLDL assembly (23, 24). This pattern is commonly 
found in patients infected with HCV genotype 3 (27) and in fatty 
liver Shionogi (FLS) mice (28). Similar to FLS mice, Mir122a–/–
mice also have a slight impairment of glucose tolerance, although 
serum glucose levels were not significantly affected (Supplemen￾tal Figure 3B). We also observed a reduction in the expression of 
hepatic glycogen synthase (GYS2), which partially explains the 
inadequate glycogen accumulation (Supplemental Figure 3, A and 
C). Although short-term inhibition of miR-122a using an anti￾sense approach has been shown to improve liver steatosis in mice 
fed a high-fat diet (6), our results reveal a close association between 
a long-term deficiency in miR-122a and certain metabolic diseases.
Mir122a deletion promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and 
spontaneous HCC formation. Recent data have suggested that the 
repression of miR-122 correlates with clinically relevant parameters 
of HCC, and this miRNA could potentially play a crucial role in 
hepatocarcinogenesis (12–16). Therefore, we investigated whether 
Mir122a deletion can lead to spontaneous liver tumors. Indeed, liver 
lesions and spontaneous HCC developed in Mir122a–/– mice. Inter￾estingly, a striking sex disparity in HCC occurrence was observed 
in the Mir122a–/– mice. The male-to-female incidence ratio was 
3.9:1 (Table 2), which recapitulates the observed HCC incidence in 
humans (29). An increased serum IL-6 level was detected in tumor￾bearing mice of both sexes (Supplemental Figure 4, C and D), which 
prevented us from testing the hypothesis that higher serum IL-6 
is as an independent risk factor for HCC development in females 
(30, 31). Other sex-dependent mechanisms may account for the sex 
disparity of HCC observed in Mir122a–/– mice. Spontaneous tumors 
in the early stages of growth appeared as solitary events. The 
tumors were round-shaped, with smoothly demarcated edges and 
a uniform cellular morphology that resembled a well-differentiated 
liver tumor (Figure 4A, 11 months). However, older mice presented 
with multiple large tumors with edges that displayed an invasive 
appearance (Figure 4A, 14 months). Advanced tumors displayed 
marked cell pleomorphisms, including occasional giant cells and 
fatty droplets, a phenotype resembling that of poorly differentiat￾ed HCC tumors in humans (Figure 4A, insets). These tumors also 
exhibited rapid proliferation (Figure 4A, anti-PCNA) and expressed 
elevated levels of various oncofetal genes, including Afp, Igf2 (32), 
and Src, as well as tumor-initiating cell markers such as Prom1 (33), 
Thy1 (34), and Epcam (ref. 35 and Figure 4B). Similar to human 
HCC cells (36), the Mir122a–/– tumor cells had molecular altera￾tions that were consistent with epithelial-mesenchymal transition 
(EMT), including loss of E-cadherin and upregulation of vimentin 
(Figure 5, A–C). To establish the timing of hepatocarcinogenesis 
in the Mir122a–/– mice, we restored miR-122a levels by hydrody￾namic injection of miR-122a in 3-month-old Mir122a–/– mice. The 
continuous reexpression of miR-122a effectively impaired hepato￾carcinogenesis and tumor progression, and this was reflected by a 
reduction in tumor occurrence and size (Table 3), the presence of 
well-differentiated features, including smoothly demarcated edges 
and reduced nuclear pleomorphism (Figure 5D) and a reduction in 
angiogenesis (Supplemental Figure 5).
The expression profile of Mir122a–/– mice accurately mimics human HCC. 
We suspected that the pathogenic association between miR-122 
deficiency and hepatic disease is likely multifactorial in nature. We 
first profiled liver tissues from 2-month-old male Mir122a–/– mice 
and found upregulation of 606 genes and downregulation of 280 
genes (Supplemental Table 3). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) 
(37) revealed that multiple pathways in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of 
Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database (http://www.genome.jp/
kegg/pathway.html) were significantly affected (Supplemental 
Figure 6 and Supplemental Table 4). To identify general pathway 
disturbances that might drive cancer initiation and progression, we 
performed a comprehensive gene expression analysis of livers from 
2-month-old Mir122a–/– mice and tumors from Mir122a–/– mice. 
Notably, pathways involved in steroid biosynthesis, bile acid biosyn￾thesis, and peroxisomes were suppressed in Mir122a–/– livers (Table 4 
and Supplemental Figure 7), which substantiates the findings of 
earlier studies on mice that were administered miR-122 antisense 
oligomers (5, 6, 8, 38). Several pathways were significantly enriched, 
including those involved in the immune response, fibrogenesis, 
EMT, signal transduction, cell survival, cell death, and cancer pheno￾types (Table 4 and Figure 6A). The expression array results provide 
a clear molecular explanation for the fibrotic phenotype observed 
in the Mir122a–/– mice, because liver fibrosis is associated with both 
TGF-β signaling and the disruption of cell-cell interactions (21, 39). 
In addition, the enrichment patterns observed in the curated gene 
sets from hepatoma patients with high versus low miR-122 levels 
(16) support the hypothesis that the pathway disturbances observed 
in the Mir122a–/– mice accurately mimic human HCC. We demon￾strated a strong activation of MAPK signaling (Figure 6B), which is 
also present in the expression profile of KEGG Pathways in Cancer 
(Figure 6A and Supplemental Table 5). Moreover, we detected low 
PTEN expression and activation of Akt signaling (Figure 6B), also 
similar to levels in human HCC (40). Although there were no histo￾logical signs of precancerous lesions in samples from younger mice, 
the enriched pathways clearly indicate that pathway dysregulation 
in the liver began in young Mir122a–/– mice.
Klf6 is a critical miR-122a target that regulates hepatic fibrogenesis. Next, 
we investigated how the large repertoire of miR-122a target genes 
might contribute to the control of miR-122a in the liver. We pre￾dicted that 252 human-mouse orthologs were potential miR-122a 
target genes (Supplemental Table 6). Five genes that we believe to 
be novel miR-122a targets were experimentally verified, and these 
might be relevant to the control of liver disease, namely Alpl, Cs, Klf6, 
Prom1, and Sox4 (ref. 41, Figure 7A, and Supplemental Table 7). The

identification of Prom1 as a miR-122a target corroborates the link 
between miR-122a deficiency and altered hepatocyte differentia￾tion. In the absence of cholestasis (Supplemental Figure 8), elevat￾ed expression of Alpl offers a reasonable explanation for the higher 
serum ALP levels in the mutant mice. We also performed binding 
site mutation analysis and confirmed the function of the predicted 
sites in the 3′ UTR of the Klf6 transcript (Figure 7, B–D). While low 
expression of Krüppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) was found primarily 
in the hepatocytes of WT livers (Figure 7, F and I), stronger KLF6 
protein expression was observed in the Mir122a–/– hepatocytes 
and in some HSCs (Figure 7I, blue arrows). The HSCs were highly 
activated in Mir122a–/– livers (Figure 7, F and I). In a 14-day treat￾ment protocol, shKlf6 (Figure 7E) effectively reduced the severity 
of liver fibrosis (Figure 7F), the elevated serum levels of TGF-β1 
(Figure 7H), and the hallmarks of HSC activation (Figure 7, G and 
I). KLF6 is a pro-fibrogenic transcription factor that is known to 
transactivate the gene expression of COL1A1 (26), TGFB1, TGFBR1, 
and TGFBR2 (42), and higher expression of KLF6 is associated with 
fibrosis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (43). These 
results provide strong initial evidence that will help to elucidate 
the mechanisms behind the increase in liver fibrosis observed with 
the loss of miR-122a.
Discussion
In this study, we have shown that the deletion 
of Mir122a exerts wide-ranging effects on liver 
homeostasis. Earlier studies involving mice and a 
knockdown approach provided an initial under￾standing of how miR-122a might regulate lipid 
metabolism. Despite these studies, a distinct miR￾122–mediated regulatory mechanism was lacking 
(44). However, reduced levels of serum cholesterol 
have become a reliable biomarker for the in vivo 
antagonism of miR-122 in rodents (5, 6) and in 
primates (45) (http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/
NCT00979927). In contrast to this benign phe￾notype, our study shows that liver toxicity due to 
long-term suppression of miR-122a in Mir122a–/–
mice is characterized by phenotypes similar to 
human liver pathology, including persistent ste￾atohepatitis, fibrosis, and HCC (Figures 1 and 4). One explana￾tion for this apparent discrepancy is that there are differences in 
the timing and duration of the two types of impaired miR-122a 
expression, because the mice experiencing transient miR-122a 
silencing only exhibit the early phenotypes caused by miR-122a 
deficiency that are seemingly beneficial.
Hepatic steatosis during miR-122a deficiency is attributable to a global 
impairment of lipid metabolism and lipoprotein assembly and secretion. 
Although there is a marked reduction in the expression of genes 
involved in lipid biogenesis (Figure 2C), an accumulation of both 
cholesterol and TG in the liver was present in the Mir122a–/– mice. 
The hypothesis that miR-122a plays a critical role in proper lipo￾protein secretion via MTTP regulation is supported by the data 
demonstrating the successful reversal of hepatic steatosis after 
the in vivo restoration of Mttp or the reexpression of miR-122a 
(Figure 3). Our results further suggest that the hepatic steatosis 
observed in miR-122a–deficient mice is the consequence of the 
global impairment of lipid metabolism and lipoprotein assembly 
and secretion as demonstrated by the repression of multiple genes 
involved in lipid metabolism (Figure 2C and ref. 12), by the com￾plex hepatic lipid contents determined by 1H-NMR (Figure 2E), 
and by the abnormal levels of both VLDL and HDL (Figure 2, A–C). 
Lower apoE represents a risk for fatty liver development, as seen 
in the apoE-knockout mouse model (46). MTTP is important in 
the prevention of degradation and lipidation of the nascent apoB 
during the generation of VLDL in the liver (23, 24). Like other 
repressed genes in lipid metabolism, Mttp is not a bona fide target 
gene of miR-122a. Nevertheless, it is well documented that most 
miRNAs modulate the expression of multiple genes at the post￾transcriptional level (47, 48). However, miRNA regulation can also 
be transmitted by transcription factors via an integrated regula￾tory loop (49). It is plausible that a negative regulator(s) of Mttp is 
directly targeted and inhibited by miR-122a. By the same token, the 
mechanism of repression of the lipogenic genes is not self-evident. 
We reasoned that there might be multiple unidentified miR-122a 
target genes mediating the regulation of lipid and lipoprotein 
metabolism. The detailed molecular mechanisms involved in how 
miR-122a regulates Mttp and other lipid metabolism genes have yet 
to be determined and are currently under rigorous investigation.
In Mir122a–/– mice, hepatic steatosis developed at birth and 
was followed by the appearance of liver inflammation and HSC 
activation by 1 month after birth (Supplemental Figure 9, B and 
C). Reduced expression of Mttp in fetal livers (data not shown)

may contribute to the early emergence of steatosis in Mir122a–/–
mice. The fact that overexpression of MTTP in Mir122a–/– mice 
leads to a reduction in inflammation implies that correcting the 
metabolic defects prevents the inflammatory response (Figure 3). 
However, this effect on tumorigenesis should be evaluated in a 
long-term follow-up study.
The present results suggest that hepatic fibrosis is promoted via the miR-122a/
KLF6 axis. Although the pathophysiology of the Mir122a–/– mouse 
model bears some resemblance to that of the Dicer1-KO mouse 
model (17, 18), these two genetically modified mouse models 
are distinctively different. When compared with Mir122a–/– mice, 
Dicer1-KO mice exhibit different serum profiles, show severe 
hypoglycemia upon fasting, and do not develop fibrosis. Liver 
fibrogenesis is a gradual process involving the increased secretion 
and decreased degradation of the ECM and involves the interplay 
between hepatocytes and HSCs (39). There is now evidence dem￾onstrating that the activation of HSCs requires miRNAs and that 
the expression of certain miRNAs is modulated by activated HSCs, 
which then facilitate the progression of liver fibrosis (50, 51).
One unresolved question is how Mir122a regulates liver fibrosis. 
We observed the concordant expression of 3 fibrogenic factors, Ctgf, 
Klf6, and Tgfb1, as well as increased collagen deposition, in Mir122a–/–
mice (Figure 3 and Supplemental Figure 10). These data suggest 
that the loss of miR-122a drives hepatic fibrogenesis in part via the 
regulation of these fibrogenic factors. As this is the first time to our 
knowledge that KLF6 has been identified as a target of miR-122a 
(Figure 7), we wondered whether the effects of miR-122a deficiency 
on KLF6 were cell-autonomous. The immunohistochemistry analy￾sis showed that there was low expression of KLF6 in the hepatocytes 
in the WT livers (Figure 7I), but stronger KLF6 expression was 
observed in Mir122a–/– hepatocytes and in some HSCs (Figure 7I, 
blue arrows, KLF6hi HSCs). Furthermore, the reduction of elevated

serum TGF-β1 levels (Figure 7H) that was due to the presence of 
shKlf6 was concordant with inactivation of HSCs. Since miR-122a 
is specifically expressed in hepatocytes (17), we speculate that 
higher levels of KLF6 in Mir122–/– hepatocytes may transactivate 
Tgfb1 (38) and possibly other target genes to initiate an activa￾tion cascade for the downstream activation of HSCs and/or other 
hepatic myofibroblasts. These results suggest that the effect of 
miR-122a deficiency on KLF6 is cell-autonomous. The liver fibro￾sis due to the loss of miR-122a in hepatocytes leads to the down￾stream activation of HSCs and/or other cell types. Once the acti￾vation cascade is initiated, several cell types can simultaneously 
engage in the fibrogenesis process.
Our current study has provided an example of the interplay between 
hepatocytes and HSCs by highlighting the involvement of the 
miR-122a/KLF6 axis in hepatic fibrogenesis. KLF6 is a transcription￾al regulator involved in a broad range of cellular processes. Hepatic 
expression of KLF6 is invariably associated with steatohepatitis and 
fibrotic injury of the liver in both patients and experimental rodents 
(43, 52, 53). The miR-122a/KLF6 axis not only reveals a mechanism 
that results in hepatic fibrosis but also provides clues that may help 
establish new modalities for the treatment of liver fibrosis.
The Mir122a–/– mouse model recapitulates the hepatocarcinogenesis 
of human HCC. To better understand the molecular mechanisms 
underlying the spontaneous development of liver tumors in

Mir122a–/– mice, we performed unbiased gene expression profiling 
of the liver samples. Using GSEA analysis, we identified the global 
gene expression patterns in the tumor-free livers of young mice 
in the early liver lesions and in the HCC samples. These analyses 
revealed that the gene expression patterns in these samples are 
similar but also have substantial differences (Figure 6, A and B). 
A detailed analysis of Pathways in Cancer (Figure 6B and Supple￾mental Table 5) indicated that there was an age-dependent and 
continuous change in the expression of both downregulated and 
upregulated genes between the tumor-free livers at 2 months, the 
early liver lesions at 11 months, and the HCC at 14 months. A 
group of 55 genes (Rad51 through Ikbkg listed in Supplemental 
Table 5) was upregulated in the tumor-free livers, which suggests 
that tumor signature genes are induced early in miR-122a–defi￾cient livers. The strong activation of PI3K and MAPK signaling 
(Figure 6B) in these tumors further supports the 
findings from the expression profiling. Thus, 
our data suggest that the pathway disturbances 
associated with Mir122a deletion contribute to 
tumor initiation and progression. our study dif￾fers from those using either in vivo knockdown 
of Mir122a (5, 6, 8, 38) or Dicer1 (17, 18). First, 
there are sequential changes in gene expression 
as the stage of malignancy progresses. Further￾more, liver tumors arising in Mir122a–/– mice har￾bor gene expression signatures that are similar to 
those of human HCC samples in which miR-122 
is suppressed (Table 4, miR-122-LvH up and miR-122-LvH down) 
(16). In addition, the significant enrichment of fibrosis and the 
TGF-β signaling pathways, along with the changes in gene expres￾sion at various cellular junctions, support the observation that 
Mir122a–/– mice livers undergo EMT.
In Mir122a–/– mice, the initial signs of EMT are loss of the por￾tal distribution of E-cadherin and the gain of vimentin expres￾sion, which were observed in our 1-month-old mice (data not 
shown). This was followed by the loss of E-cadherin expression in 
the tumors (Figure 5, A–C). Similarly, the expression of various 
selected oncofetal genes, namely Afp, Igf2, and Src, together with 
the cancer stem cell marker genes Prom1, Thy1, and Epcam, could 
be first detected in the livers of young Mir122a–/– mice, and this 
was followed by further increases in the expression of these genes 
in the tumors (Figure 4B). The evidence that Prom1 is a miR-122a

determine whether Prom1/Src signaling plays a regulatory role 
in facilitating the cellular transformation of hepatocytes that are

of pre-Mir122a was cloned into PL253 in the bacterial strain EL350 by a 
recombineering-based method (19). The genomic fragment of Mir122a
from PL253 was used to replace the WT allele of Mir122a in 129/Sv mouse 
embryonic stem cells (MESCs). MESC clones containing the targeted 
allele were identified by Southern blot analysis. Several clones were iso￾lated and transfected together with a vector encoding the Cre recombi￾nase that allowed the deletion of a fragment of 1,544 bp containing the 
entire pre-Mir122a. Clones with the Mir122a knockout allele were identi￾fied by Southern blot analysis and were injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts. 
Germline transmission of the Mir122a– allele was achieved by crossing the 
chimeric mice produced with normal C57BL/6 mice. Finally, homozygous 
Mir122a–/– mice were generated by crossing heterozygous littermate off￾spring. The genotyping of the F1 and successive generations was performed 
by Southern blotting and by PCR (Supplemental Figure 1, B and C).
Serological analysis. Serum biochemical studies, including analysis of total 
cholesterol, TG, ALT, and ALP, were performed monthly. Serum was col￾lected and analyzed using a DRI-CHEM 3500S (Fujifilm).
Histology and immunohistochemistry. Resected liver tissue was processed 
as either paraffin sections or cryosections. Oil red O staining was per￾formed on frozen sections fixed with formalin. The paraffin sections 
were processed to allow H&E staining, periodic PAS staining, Sirius red 
staining, and immunohistochemical studies. The immunohistochemical 
analysis used antibodies against F4/80, CD31, collagen I (Abcam), PCNA, 
vimentin, MTTP, E-cadherin (Cell Signaling Technology), desmin (Mil￾lipore), and KLF6 (Abgent).
RNA isolation, gene expression, and high-density oligonucleotide microarray 
analysis. Super RNApure (Genesis Biotech Inc.) was used to extract total 
RNA from the various frozen liver samples. Quantitative RT-qPCR was 
performed according to the manufacturer’s specifications with B2m
(β-2 microglobulin) RNA as an internal control (primer sequences in 
Supplemental Table 2). The microarray hybridizations were performed 
using total RNA prepared from the liver samples of 3 WT mice and 4 
Mir122a–/– mice at the age of 2 months; liver samples from 2 WT mice 
and tumor samples from 3 Mir122a–/– mice at the age of 11 months; and 
liver samples from 3 WT mice and tumor samples from 5 Mir122a–/– mice 
at the age of 14 months. GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Affymetrix 
oligonucleotide Gene Chips (Affymetrix) were analyzed at the Microarray 
& Gene Expression Analysis Core Facility (VYM Genome Research Center, 
National Yang-Ming University) according to the Affymetrix protocols. 
All the data files are presented in compliance with MIAMI guidelines 
and can be accessed online at the Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE27713 
and GSE31453). Microarray datasets were analyzed using GSEA (version 
3.2) (37) from the Broad Institute. Detailed information can be found in 
Supplemental Methods.
Lipoprotein electrophoresis. Blood for mouse serum lipoprotein analysis 
was obtained after 2 consecutive overnights (16 hours) of fasting. Serum 
lipoproteins were analyzed on the Hydragel K20 Electrophoresis System 
(Sebia) according to the manufacturer’s methodology.
Extraction of total lipids from liver. Mice were fasted for 2 consecutive over￾nights (16 hours) before liver tissue sampling. A 0.2- to 0.5-g portion of the 
liver was frozen in lipid nitrogen and ground into a powder in a mortar. A 
4-ml mixture of chloroform and methanol was added to create a suspension 
to allow the extraction of lipids (57). The procedure was repeated twice. A 
total of 12 ml of extraction solution was used. The mixtures containing the 
extracted lipids were pooled into a 20-ml saponification tube. After adding 
3 ml distilled water to the mortar in order to resuspend the tissue material, 
the resulting suspension was added to the extracts. The pooled suspension 
was then extensively vortexed (30 seconds 4 times, followed by centrifuga￾tion at 1,250 g for 30 minutes. A 4-ml portion of the top layer and a 5-ml 
portion of the bottom layer were separately collected into 20-ml counting 
disease manifestation and tumor incidence, which suggests that 
the reexpression of Mir122a is very effective in restoring hepatocyte 
differentiation (Table 3 and Figure 5D).
Despite the fact that significant miR-122a expression was 
detected in E12.5 mouse fetal livers, the role of miR-122a in liver 
development has not been formally addressed. Because cancer 
formation recapitulates development processes, it is imperative 
to recognize the role(s) of miR-122 in hepatocyte development 
and differentiation. Recently, Laudadio et al. (56) reported that a 
positive feedback loop between miR-122a and HNF6 (Onecut 1) 
drives hepatocyte differentiation. While Mir122a expression is sig￾nificantly repressed in the E15.5 fetal livers of H6/O2 mice (double 
knockout of Onecut1 and Onecut2), Hnf6 expression is increased in 
the fetal livers of Mir122a-transgenic mice. Similar to Mttp, Hnf6 is 
not a bona fide target gene of miR-122a. Hnf6 levels were slightly 
reduced in 2-month-old Mir122a–/– mice (data not shown), indi￾cating that miR-122a does not play a dominant role in regulating 
Hnf6 at this age and that further studies will be necessary to detect 
effects earlier in development.
In summary, this work describes the attempt to study the 
mechanisms involved in miR-122a regulation of liver homeosta￾sis using an in vivo loss-of-function model. The results from this 
study show that targeted deletion of Mir122a in mice is able to 
mimic several key features of the phenotypes of human NAFLD 
and HCC. Our proof-of-concept experiment also suggests that the 
restoration of miR-122 constitutes a novel approach that could be 
used in differentiation therapy for chronic liver diseases and HCCs 
that express low levels of miR-122.

were 3 months old. Serum biochemical studies were carried out on day 5, 
day 14, or at the times indicated. The mice were sacrificed after 1 month 
or 8 months for histological examination and gene expression analysis. To 
restore the expression of MTTP in Mir122a–/– mice, one dose of 20 μg endo￾toxin-free Mttp expression construct (Origene MC204263) or pCMV6-NEO 
control vector (Origene) was delivered using the same injection protocol over 
1 month. Each group included 5 mice that were 3 months old.
For delivery of shRNA expression constructs in vivo, all mice received a 
weekly dose of 20 μg of endotoxin-free shRNA construct using the same 
injection protocol for 2 weeks. Mice were sacrificed 14 days later. The 
shKlf6 (TRCN0000218241) and shLacZ (TRCN0000072224) constructs 
were obtained from TRC (National RNAi Core Facility, Academia Sinica). 
shLacZ targeting the β-galactosidase gene was used as a control for RNA 
interference. Each group consisted of 5 mice that were 7 months old.
Assays for serum TGF-β1. Serum samples were frozen at –80°C until 
assayed. The serum levels of TGF-β1 were measured by a commercial 
ELISA kit (eBioscience) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Statistics. All data are expressed as mean ± SD and were compared between 
groups using the 1-tailed Student’s t test. A P value of 0.05 or less was 
considered significant.

upper aqueous layer was concentrated on a centrifugal concentrator. The 
two residues were then stored at –80°C before NMR measurement.
1H-NMR measurement. The lipid residues were resuspended in 400 μl 
deuterated chloroform (CDCl3). The solution was transferred to a 5-mm 
NMR tube. NMR measurements were carried out on a 400-MHz Fourier 
transform NMR (FT-NMR) spectrometer (Bruker) with a BDI probehead. 
The pulse sequence and data acquisition for the NMR measurements were 
similar to those reported by Beckonert et al. (22). A reference sample con￾taining 2 mg cholesterol in CDCl3 and under the same NMR conditions 
was used for comparison and quantification (signal intensity of H-18, 
chemical shift 0.65 ppm).
Identifying miR-122 targets among the upregulated genes of Mir122a–/– livers. 
Three computational tools, namely miRanda (58), TargetScanS (59), and 
RNAhybrid (60), which have been successfully integrated by us in miRNA￾Map previously (61), were used in this study. In order to achieve higher 
prediction accuracy, we also integrated another tool, PITA (62). The inte￾grated tools were then used to identify the miR-122a target sites located 
within the accessible regions of the 3′ UTRs of the upregulated genes in the 
Mir122a–/– mouse liver. Upregulated orthologous genes with target sites 
in both the mouse and human genomes were pinpointed. The analysis 
strategy and the performance evaluation are presented in Supplemental 
Methods and Supplemental Tables 6–8.
3′ UTR reporter assay. The 3′ UTR fragments of the candidate target genes 
were subcloned using XhoI and NotI downstream of the luciferase gene in 
the vector psi-CHECK2 (Promega). The negative controls were lenti-122M 
and lenti-GFP (15). HEK293T cells were infected with lenti-GFP (293T￾GFP), lenti-122 (293T-122), or lenti-122M (293T-122M) for 24 hours. Cells 
were then seeded into 24-well plates and co-transfected with 0.5 μg of the 
respective psi-CHECK2-3′ UTR construct using jetPEI (Polyplus Trans￾fection). After 48 hours, luciferase activity was measured using the Dual￾Luciferase Reporter Assay System Kit (Promega). The effect of miR-122a 
was expressed relative to the average value from 293T-122M cells. Three 
mutants of the miR-122a binding sites in the 3′ UTR of KLF6 were includ￾ed in this study, namely KLF6-mu1, KLF6-mu2, and KLF6-mu1+mu2. The 
nucleotide sequences of all of the PCR cloning primers (Supplemental 
Table 9) and mutagenesis primers (Supplemental Table 10) are also listed.
Western blotting. Protein lysates (30 μg) were separated by electrophoresis on 
10% SDS polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto PVDF membranes (Mil￾lipore) for immunoblotting. The membranes were incubated with primary 
antibodies overnight at 4°C and then with horseradish peroxidase–conju￾gated secondary antibody (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Primary antibodies 
against apoB-100, apoB-48 (Novus), apoE, MTTP, vimentin, GAPDH, FASN, 
desmin, PTEN, phospho-Akt, Akt, phospho–c-Raf, c-Raf, phospho-MEK1/2, 
MEK1/2, phospho-Erk, Erk, phospho-GYS2, GYS2, E-cadherin (Cell Signal￾ing Technology), and KLF6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) were used. Sig￾nals were detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (PerkinElmer). 
The relative levels of protein expression were normalized against GAPDH.
Hydrodynamic injection. A partial human pri-MIR122 gene was subcloned 
into the vector pcDNA3.1(B) (Invitrogen) and designated pcDNA-MIR122 
(15). Plasmid DNA was injected by the hydrodynamic technique as previ￾ously described (25). Briefly, 20 μg of endotoxin-free plasmid DNA was dis￾solved in 2 ml of sterile pharmaceutical-grade saline at room temperature 
and injected into the mouse tail vein with a 26.5-gauge needle over 6 seconds. 
For the short-term study (1-month duration), all the mice received 2 injec￾tions, one on day 1 and one on day 15. For the long-term study (8-month 
duration), all the mice received one injection per month for the duration of 
the study. The WT mice were injected with the pcDNA3.1(B) HA vector DNA 
only, while the Mir122a–/– mice were injected with either the pcDNA3.1(B) 
HA vector DNA or HA-miR-122 DNA. Each group included 5 or 7 mice that
