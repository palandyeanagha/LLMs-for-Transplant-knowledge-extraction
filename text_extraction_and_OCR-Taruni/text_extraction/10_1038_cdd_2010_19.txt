Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by tumor necrosis factor-α
(TNF-α) have an important function in cell death by activating c-
Jun N-terminal kinase. However, the exact mechanism of
mitochondrial ROS production, after TNF-α stimulation, is not
clearly understood. In this study, we determined that ROS
modulator 1 (Romo1) and B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-XL) are
directly associated with TNF-α-induced ROS production. In response


to TNF-α, TNF complex II, which consists of receptor-interacting
protein 1, TNF receptor-associated protein with death domain, TNF
receptor-associated factor 2, Fas-associated death domain protein,
and pro-caspase-8, binds to the C-terminus of Romo1 located in the
mitochondria. Concurrently, Romo1 recruits Bcl-XL to reduce the
mitochondrial membrane potential, resulting in ROS production
and apoptotic cell death. On the basis of these results, we suggest
that Romo1 is a molecular bridge between TNF-α signaling and the
mitochondria for ROS production that triggers TNF-α-mediated
apoptosis, as well as a novel target in the development of anti-
inflammatory agents that block the origin of ROS production.
