SARS-coronavirus-2–induced immune dysregulation and inflammatory responses are
involved in the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). However, very
little is known about immune cell and cytokine alterations in specific organs of COVID-19
patients. Here, we evaluated immune cells and cytokines in postmortem tissues, i.e.,
lungs, intestine, liver, kidneys, and spleen of three patients with COVID-19. Imaging
mass cytometry revealed monocyte, macrophage, and dendritic cell (DC) infiltration
in the lung, intestine, kidney, and liver tissues. Moreover, in patients with COVID-19,
natural killer T cells infiltrated the liver, lungs, and intestine, whereas B cells infiltrated the
kidneys, lungs, and intestine. CD11b+ macrophages and CD11c+ DCs also infiltrated
the lungs and intestine, a phenomenon that was accompanied by overproduction of the
immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin (IL)-10. However, CD11b+ macrophages and
CD11c+ DCs in the lungs or intestine of COVID-19 patients did not express human
leukocyte antigen DR isotype. In contrast, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α expression was
higher in the lungs, intestine, liver, and kidneys, but not in the spleen, of all COVID-19
patients (compared to levels in controls). Collectively, these findings suggested that IL-10
and TNF-α as immunosuppressive and pro-inflammatory agents, respectively,—might be
prognostic and could serve as therapeutic targets for COVID-19.

Wang et al. Immune Cell and Cytokine Responses
Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has
become a global pandemic and the worst public health crisis
at present. COVID-19 has been reported to be associated
with diverse co-morbidities, such as pneumonia, respiratory
failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and sepsis, that are
usually associated with pathophysiological changes, including
alveolar macrophage activation, lymphopenia, and thrombosis
(Chen et al., 2020; Fu et al., 2020; Guan et al., 2020; Huang
et al., 2020; Jose and Manuel, 2020; Moore and June, 2020;
Wang et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020). Additionally, in addition
to the lower respiratory tract and lungs, SARS-CoV-2 targets
many other organs, including the liver, heart, intestine, kidneys,
central nervous system, and muscles, thereby resulting in
multiorgan injury, which is frequently associated with severe
or even fatal outcomes (De Felice et al., 2020; Varga et al.,
2020; Zhang C. et al., 2020). Immune dysregulation and
inflammation are therefore involved in the pathogenesis of
COVID-19 (Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al., 2020; Moore and
June, 2020). However, most of the information regarding the
dysregulation of immune cells and cytokines has been obtained
from studies using blood samples from patients. Therefore, it is
essential to profile COVID-19-associated immune cell and pro￾inflammatory cytokine responses in specific organs and tissues to
improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease.
Tissue samples from COVID-19 patients including the lungs,
intestine, spleen, liver, and kidneys, were obtained from three
deceased COVID-19 patients. Paracancerous tissues from lung
cancer, colorectal cancer, hepatocarcinoma, or renal cancer
patients without COVID-19, as well as splenic tissues from
trauma patients, were used as controls. The tissues were
sectioned, fixed in formalin, and embedded in paraffin. COVID￾19 or control sections were probed using a panel of 27
antibodies that enabled the detection of different lymphocyte
types, cytokines, lymphocyte activation, and vascular and
spatial structures of tissue cells (Supplementary Table 1). These
sections were then subjected to imaging mass cytometry (IMC;
Figure 1A). IMC is a progressive imaging technique that rather
than analyzing single cells in suspension as in case of flow
cytometry enables the detection of approximately 37 epitopes
in paraffin-embedded tissue sections based on simultaneous
antibody probing, thereby revealing the entire structure of
the scanned tissue. Compared to immunohistochemistry or
immunofluorescence, this technique can effectively reduce the
background signal and crossover between fluorescence by
employing isotopically applied metal tags and mass spectrometry.
Meanwhile, the number of samples tested is reduced to one
paraffin section, which greatly reduces sample consumption.
IMC can not only improve the quality of experiments and
results but also can facilitate subsequent bioinformatic analysis
on the original specimen. Further, semi-quantitative data
result in more accurate and upgraded information compared
to those obtained with the simple qualitative analysis of
images. Therefore, for accurate detection of the parameters,
the adjustment of image parameters and the design and
redacting of analysis algorithms are crucial. We used a t￾SNE map to display 55,391 subsampled single cells from
each PhenoGraph cluster identified in the heatmap image
colored according to sample (control, patient 1, patient
2, patient 3), organ (lungs, intestine, spleen, liver, and
kidneys), and cluster (Figures 1B–D). The z-scored mean
marker expression of the panel markers was determined for
each PhenoGraph cluster using heatmap analysis. Clusters
and markers were grouped according to expression profiles
(Figure 1E). Furthermore, we compared the percent relative
abundances of cell clusters between the three patients and the
control using a histogram (Figure 1F).
First, we found that monocytes (CD14 and CD68) infiltrated
the lungs (Figures 2A,B) and intestines (Figures 3A,B) of
patients with COVID-19. Moreover, CD11b+ macrophage,
CD11c+ dendritic cell (DC), CD3+ CD56+ natural killer
T (NKT) cell, and CD19+ B cell counts were higher in
the lungs (Figures 2A,B) and intestines (Figures 3A,B) of
patients with COVID-19 than in those of controls. These data
suggest that the lung and intestine are the major targeted
organs in COVID-19 and that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces
a strong immune response in these organs. The difference
among patient 1, patient 2 and patient 3 on the whole
morphology of the lung and intestine tissues could be due
to the different severity of acute lung and intestine injuries
of these patients. However, changes in these immune cells
differed in other organs. For example, in the liver of patients
with COVID-19, no significant differences were observed in
macrophage (CD14 and CD68) counts compared with those in
controls (Supplementary Figures 1A,B), and counts of CD11b+
macrophages, CD11c+ DCs, and CD3+ CD56+ NKT cells were
also higher than those in the control, the exception being
patient 1 (Supplementary Figures 1A,B). In contrast, in the
kidney, CD11b+ macrophage, CD11c+ DC, and CD19+ B cell
counts were higher in patients 1 and 2 than those in the
control, and patients 2 and 3 had more monocytes (CD14
and CD68) than the control (Supplementary Figures 2A,B).
The counts of all immune cell were reduced in the spleens
of patients with COVID-19 (Supplementary Figures 3A,B). In
previous studies, flow cytometric analyses of peripheral blood
mononuclear cells from symptomatic patients with COVID￾19 revealed the significant influx of CD14+ monocytes (Xu
et al., 2020; Zhang Y. et al., 2020), consistent with our findings.
Furthermore, compared to those in control samples, the numbers
of CD11b+ macrophages and CD11c+ DCs were elevated in
the lungs, intestine, liver, and kidneys of all three patients with
COVID-19 (Supplementary Figures 1, 2). However, CD11b+
macrophages and CD11c+ DCs were reduced in the spleens of
patients with COVID-19 (Supplementary Figure 3), suggesting
that the responses of CD11b+ macrophages and CD11c+ DCs to
SARS-CoV-2 might be transferred from the spleen to the infected
site or other damaged sites. Together, these results indicated that
macrophages and DCs infiltrate the lungs—the major infection
site of SARS-CoV-2—and other organs, including the intestine,
kidneys, and liver, and this phenomenon is probably associated
with multiorgan injuries. Moreover, NKT cells infiltrated the
liver, lungs, and intestine of patients with COVID-19, and B cells
infiltrated the kidneys, lungs, and intestines of these patients.
These data suggest that unequal immune cell infiltration could

found not to be expressed in CD11b+ macrophages or CD11c+
DCs (Figures 4D–F). Macrophages and DCs are the major
antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and HLA-DR is the connecting
link between the innate and adaptive immune responses. Our
findings support the results of a previous study showing that IL￾6 induces low HLA-DR expression and lymphopenia in patients
with severe COVID-19 associated with immune dysregulation
(Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al., 2020) and that the counts
of circulating HLA-DR-positive cells were increased during
convalescence in a patient with moderately severe COVID-19
(Thevarajan et al., 2020). Thus, severe respiratory failure (SRF)-
aggravated pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 might involve the
following: a unique immunosuppressive pathway aimed at IL￾10 overproduction via the inhibition of HLA-DR activation on
APCs; high IL-10 secretion by macrophages and DCs.
Finally, we demonstrated the overproduction of tumor
necrosis factor (TNF)-α in the lungs of all patients with
COVID-19. In addition, TNF-α production in the intestines
was consistent with changes in TNF-α expression in the
lungs. Notably, TNF-α production was much higher in the
liver of patient 1 and in the kidneys of all patients with
COVID-19, as well as in the spleen of all patients with
COVID-19 (Figures 5A,B). Previous studies have confirmed
the role of TNF-α in promoting the pathogenesis of SARS￾CoV infection through its receptors and suggested that
the inhibition of TNF-α signaling might be leveraged as
a treatment strategy (McDermott et al., 2016). However,
extensive studies are needed to confirm the correlations between
TNF-α and other inflammatory cytokines with respect to
pathological inflammation. Circulating concentrations of IL-6
are significantly higher among patients infected with SARS￾CoV-2, and IL-6 is a key pro-inflammatory factor leading
to the generation of cytokine storms (Fu et al., 2020).
Our study showed that TNF-α is a potent cytokine related
to pathological inflammation in tissues—similar to IL-6—in
patients with COVID-19.
In summary, we showed for the first time that CD11b+
macrophages and CD11c+ DCs infiltrate the lungs and intestines,
a phenomenon that is accompanied by overproduction of the
immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10. However, the expression
of HLA-DR on CD11b+ macrophages and CD11c+ DCs was
low in the lungs and intestines of patients with COVID-19.
Furthermore, we identified a unique signature of pathogenesis
in patients with COVID-19, characterized by high levels of
IL-10 production in the lungs and intestine, which might
inhibit HLA-DR expression on macrophages or DCs, and
TNF-α overproduction in the lungs, intestines, and other
damaged tissues. This clear understanding of the delicate balance
between antiviral and inflammatory innate immune programs
will be essential to develop effective biomarkers and therapeutics
for COVID-19.
EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
Tissues
Lung, intestine, spleen, liver, and kidney tissues were obtained
by autopsy from patients with COVID-19 at Wuhan Jinyintan
Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei in China. Patient 1 was a 53-year old
woman, patient 2 was a 53-year-old woman, and patient 3 was
a 60-year-old woman. In addition, control tissues were obtained
from five different individuals; all samples were collected by
surgical operation as follows: control 1 (75-year-old woman
with no chronic basic disease) donated splenic tissue; control
2 (68-year-old man with hypertension) donated lung cancer
tissue; control 3 (64-year-old woman with hypertension) donated
kidney tissue; control 4 (72-year-old man with no chronic basic
disease) donated liver tissue; control 5 (57-year-old woman with
hypertension) donated intestine tissue (Supplementary Table 2).
Tissues were oriented during staining to investigate their
structures to the greatest extent.
All samples were treated in accordance with the
biocontainment procedures required to process SARS-CoV-2-
positive samples. All work performed in this study was approved
by the Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital Ethics Committee (No. KY￾2020-15.01). SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed based on the
New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program
(6th edition) published by the National Health Commission
of China.
Antibodies and Panel
The antibody panel included those related to lymphocyte types,
cytokine expression, lymphocyte activation, and vascular and
spatial structures of cells from other tissues. Descriptions of
the antibodies, isotope tags, clones, and concentrations used
for staining are provided in Supplementary Table 2. Metal￾conjugated primary antibodies were applied using a Maxpar
labeling kit (Fluidigm, USA). Concentration was determined
using a Biotek instrument (Berten Instruments) and was adjusted
to 0.5 µg/µL in Antibody Stabilization Solution (Candor
Bioscience GmbH, Wangen, Germany). Antibodies were stored
at 4◦C for long-term storage.
Tissue Antibody Labeling
Tissue samples were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin
at Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital. Supplementary Table 1 shows the
staining used for all samples. Slides were baked at 60◦C in
a slide dryer for 2 h, deparaffinized in xylene, and hydrated
in decreasing concentrations of ethanol (100, 95, 80, 70%)
for 5 min each. Next, 40 mL Antigen Retrieval Reagent-Basic
(R&D Systems; diluted from 10× to 1×) was added to 50 mL
conical tubes, and the tubes were incubated on a heating block
(97◦C) with loose lids. The tubes were then cooled to 60◦C by
monitoring the temperature for ∼20 min. Next, the sections were
blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 45 min at
room temperature (25◦C) in a hydration chamber. The antibody
cocktail was then prepared in 0.5% BSA in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) PH 7.4 basic. Samples were probed overnight with
antibodies at 4◦C and then washed twice with 0.1% Triton X￾100 prepared in PBS for 8 min with slow agitation in Coplin
jars. Tissues were then stained with Intercalator-Ir (Fluidigm;
cat. no. 201192A) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature to
detect DNA and air dried before IMC measurements for at least
20 min (Figure 1A).

IMC
For H&E staining, we selected the appropriate 500 × 500µm
location for scanning. IMC Images were acquired using a
Hyperion Imaging System (Fluidigm). The largest square
area was laser-ablated in a rastered pattern at 200 Hz, and
preprocessing of the raw data was completed using commercial
acquisition software (Fluidigm). IMC acquisition stability was
monitored by the interspersed acquisition of an isotope￾containing polymer (Fludigm). All successful image acquisitions
were processed using MCDViewer, CellProfilor, and HistoCAT.

Single-Cell Identification
The original MCD file was converted to TIFF format using
imctools (https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/imctools).
Data were segregated into single cells using Cellprofiler v3.1.8
(Carpenter et al., 2006). Briefly, Fluidigm DNA markers were
designed to identify nuclei, and CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45, pan￾cytokeratin, and α-smooth muscle actin were used to identify
membranes. The data were combined and analyzed using
Cellprofier to identify single-cell object masks. The mask (TIFF
file) containing the cell location and boundary was obtained.
Even with high-quality segmentation, imaging of tissue segments
yielded single-cell data from tissue slices and overlapping cell
fragments that did not always capture the nucleus of a cell;
therefore, nucleus-mismatched signals could be assigned to
neighboring cells in densely packed areas. This could lead to rare
cases in which the data assigned to one cell contained marker
expression from the neighboring cells.
Data Transformation and Normalization
Single-cell marker expression was measured using histoCat v1.75
(Schapiro et al., 2017), multiplied by a factor of 107
to yield
values larger than 1, and then log-transformed. The single-cell
data were censored at the 95th percentile to remove the outliers,
and z-scored cluster means were visualized using heat maps. For
t-SNE and PhenoGraph, the data were normalized with Harmony
(Korsunsky et al., 2019).
Clustering
Single cells from the large cohort were clustered into groups
according to their phenotypic similarity using PhenoGraph,
unsupervised clustering, and an aggregation of these clusters into
larger groups based on their markers. The data were clustered to
detect and separate rare cell subpopulations. PhenoGraph (v.2.0)
(Levine et al., 2015) was used with 15 of the nearest neighbors.
The resulting 40 clusters were aggregated into larger groups
following hierarchical clustering (Euclidean distance and Ward’s
linkage) of their mean marker correlations. Multiscale bootstrap
resampling was used to assess the uncertainty of each subtree (R
package pvclust, v.2.0).
Barnes-Hut T-SNE
For visualization, high-dimensional single-cell data were reduced
to two dimensions using the non-linear dimensionality reduction
algorithm t-SNE (Kobak and Berens, 2019). We applied the
Barnes-Hut implementation of t-SNE to Harmony-normalized
data with default parameters (perplexity = 42).
Neighborhood Analysis
To identify significantly enriched or depleted pairwise
neighbor interactions between cell types, the Cellprofier
MeasureObjectNeighbors module and neighborhood (https://
github.com/BodenmillerGroup/neighboRhood) functions were
used to perform a permutation-test-based analysis of the spatial
single-cell neighborhood. Neighboring cells were defined as
those within 4 pixels (4µm). P-values smaller than 0.01 were
considered significant.
