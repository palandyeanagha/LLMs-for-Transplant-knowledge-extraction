SARS-CoV-2 infection: can ferroptosis be a potential
treatment target for multiple organ involvement?
Ming Yang 1 and Ching Lung Lai2
Abstract
Since the outbreak of the new coronavirus in 2019 (SARS-CoV-2), many studies have been performed to better
understand the basic mechanisms and clinical features of the disease. However, uncertainties of the underlying
mechanisms of multiple organ involvement remain. A substantial proportion of severe coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) patients have lymphopenia, low serum iron levels, and multiple organ involvement. Several therapeutic
agents have been used for different stages of the disease, but the treatment for severe disease is still suboptimal.
Understanding the mechanism of programmed cell death in COVID-19 may lead to better therapeutic strategies for
these patients. On the basis of observations of basic science studies and clinical researches on COVID-19, we
hypothesize that ferroptosis, a novel programmed cell death, may be an important cause of multiple organ
involvement in COVID-19 and it might serve as a new treatment target. In spite of the existing findings on the
involvement of ferroptosis in SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is no reported study to uncover how does ferroptosis acts in
SARS-CoV-2 infection yet. Uncovering the role of ferroptosis in SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential to develop new
treatment strategies for COVID-19. Intracellular cell iron depletion or new generation of ferroptosis inhibitors might be
potential drug candidates for COVID-19. We hope this hypothesis may launch a new wave of studies to uncover the
association of ferroptosis and SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in vivo.
A snapshot of COVID-19
Ever since January 2020, clinical studies have been
reporting the features of severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) globally. The general symp￾toms of the new coronavirus infection are fever, fatigue,
and dry cough. Some patients have mild symptoms or are
asymptomatic. However, severe symptoms may develop,
including acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock,
marked metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy. The major￾ity of patients have a good prognosis, but around 20% of
patients have severe disease with high risk of death.
Most patients with mild disease have slight or no resi￾dual dysfunctions1–3
. However, for severe or critically ill
patients, there may be persistent shortness of breath with
limited physical activities due to pulmonary fibrosis as
revealed by chest computed tomography examination2–4
.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is widely expressed in
multiple organs and serves as a critical receptor of the
spikeRB receptor-binding domain on the surface of SARS￾CoV-2 for invasion of the respiratory tract5,6
. Several
pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed.
These include (i) direct virus-induced cell damage, (ii)
dysregulation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone sys￾tem, and (iii) cell damage of endothelial layer and
thromboinflammation, and imbalance of immune
response and inflammatory cytokine storm, leading to
multiple organ failure (MOF) syndrome7
.
COVID-19 and multiple organ involvement
A large number of studies have reported distinctive
multiple organ involvement in coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) patients2,8–11.

Even with respiratory failure, the most common cause
of death, there are histologic features of the lungs that are
unique. In a study of seven lungs at autopsy, Ackermann
et al.12 found that, other than diffuse alveolar damage and
perivascular lymphocyte infiltrates, which are also seen in
the lungs of patients with influenza A (H1N1), there were
three angiocentric features associated with COVID-19
patients as follows: severe endothelial injury with intra￾cellular SARS-CoV-2 virus and disrupted endothelial cell
membranes; widespread microangiopathy with vascular
thrombosis; and new vessel growth through intussuscep￾tive angiogenesis. Intussusceptive angiogenesis may be
related to the greater degree of endothelialitis and
thrombosis in COVID-19 patients.
Acute myocardial injury (12% in 41 patients) and
arrhythmia (44.4% in 36 patients requiring intensive care
unit (ICU) admission) have been reported8,10. Acute kid￾ney injury also occurs, which may be related to the direct
effects of the virus, hypoxia, or shock10. Liver derange￾ment with elevations of serum alanine aminotransferase
and aspartate aminotransferase is reported in 16–53% of
patients8,11. However, serum alkaline phosphatase is
normal in most patients. It is postulated that the liver
derangement may be due to underlying chronic liver
disease (including hepatits B, hepatitis C, and steatohe￾patitis), sepsis-related inflammatory changes, or drug
hepatotoxicity13.
In a review of thrombosis risk in COVID-19 patients,
venous thromboembolism and stroke occurred in 20%
and 3% of patients respectively14. It is postulated that
disseminated intravascular thrombosis in COVID-19
patients may represent a distinct entity of coagulopathy.
The proportion of venous thromboembolism, including
pulmonary embolism, is much higher in severe disease
with patients requiring ICU admission. Arterial throm￾bosis causing stroke and acute coronary syndrome/myo￾cardial infarction also occurs, mainly in patients with
severe disease15.
As SARS-CoV-2-induced damage in multiple organs
increases the risk of poor prognosis, it is necessary to
understand the critical mechanisms that contribute to the
damage,to decrease the occurrence of MOF.
Ferroptosis as a new form of programmed cell
death
The term “ferroptosis” was first proposed in 201216.
Unlike apoptosis, it is a newly discovered programmed
cell death, which is mainly caused by the accumulation of
lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells, resulting in
fatal lipid peroxidation17. As ferric ion overload is the
primary factor leading to the accumulation of lipid ROS, it
is named iron death.
Ferroptosis can be classified into canonical and non￾canonical types to date. Canonical ferroptosis is started
with the failure of glutathione peroxidase (GPX4) defense,
leading to excessive lipid peroxidation and cell death18.
Inactivation of GPX4 and glutathione (GSH) depletion
play a central role in the induction of canonical ferrop￾tosis18,19. Iron (II) oxidizes lipids in the Fenton reaction
(hydrogen peroxide, iron and lipid) is the hallmark feature
of ferroptosis, thereby generating lipid ROS, causing cell
membrane damage17–19. GPX4 eliminates lipid ROS by
consuming GSH and protects cell membrane against lipid
peroxidation and ferroptosis18. Moreover, cystine/gluta￾mate transporter (xCT) is responsible for providing
cystine to produce GSH for GPX4 to function normally.
Iron is an important metal in cells. But there is no efficient
mechanism for excreting iron in the human body and, as a
result, iron homeostasis is vulnerable to stresses.
In 2018, Hassannia et al.20 introduced the concept of
non-canonical ferroptosis induction. They demonstrated
iron overload-induced increase in intracellular labile iron
(II) pool, accompanied with the excessive activation of
heme oxygenase-1, is sufficient to induce non-canonical
ferroptosis20. In general, four key factors determine fer￾roptosis as follows: (i) iron overload in cells, (ii) decrease
expressions of GPX4 and xCT, (iii) the activation of acyl￾CoA synthetase long-chain family member-4 (ACSL4)
and lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase-3, and (iv)
the final increase of lipid peroxidation.
Lipid peroxidation has enzymatic (enzymatic oxygena￾tion) and non-enzymatic (free-radical chain reaction)
types. Enzymes such as lipoxygenases (LOXs), non-heme
iron dioxygenases, determine the peroxidation that trig￾gers ferroptotic cell death21,22. The non-enzymatic type is
driven by carbon- and oxygen-centered radicals23. Fer￾roptosis could be induced through iron-dependent free￾radical mechanisms, which is a non-enzymatic lipid per￾oxidation24. Both types are quenched by the GSH/GPX4
axis25 and produce lipid peroxide degradation product
such as 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and malondialdehyde,
serving as the detection markers of ferroptosis26.
The execution of ferroptosis is peroxidation of phos￾pholipid species. Recently, it has been shown that LOXs
could directly oxidize arachidonoyl (AA) and adrenoyl
(AdA) phosphatidylethanolamines (PE), thereby trigger￾ing ferroptosis21. The transformation of AA and AdA into
PE is ACSL4-dependent in this process. ACSL4 ligates
coenzyme A to long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids,
which esterifies lysophospholipids in the cell membrane
to undergo lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis21,27. Apart
from these ways, the breakdown of lipid peroxides gen￾erates 4-HNE, which is also considered to execute
ferroptosis28.
To date, in vivo studies have addressed the immuno￾genic effect of ferroptosis, apart from boosting innate
immunity20. Inhibiting ferroptosis prevents certain dis￾eases by anti-inflammatory mechanisms29. Ferroptosis has
Yang and Lai Cell Death Discovery (2020) 6:130 Page 2 of 6

been shown to contribute important pathogenic roles in
multiple system diseases involving the heart, the liver, the
gut, the lungs, the kidneys, and the nervous systems18. It
has been proven to be a primary mechanism in Myoba￾terium tuberculosis infection causing damage to various
organs of the host30. Lipid peroxidation of T-cell causes
ferroptosis, thereby preventing the infection of the
immune system31. Iron is essential for pathogens to pro￾liferate. Iron overload is an important mechanism con￾tributing to the pathogenesis of various viruses such as
hepatitis B32, hepatitis C33,34, HIV-135, and human cyto￾megalovirus infection36. Reducing the iron level in the
infected cells can effectively inhibit the growth of these
viruses and development of the diseases induced by the
viruses37,38. These studies suggest the direct manipulation
of iron metabolism by viruses and the consequences of
iron homeostasis imbalance caused by viruses. As the
outcome of ferroptosis is cell death, it might explain the
clinical features of multiple organ involvement and failure
in COVID-19 patients.
In addition, the induction of ferroptosis in cancer cells
can promote the death of cancer cells. This discovery
brings new ideas for the development of anti-cancer
drugs, especially for drug-resistant cancer cells, providing
an alternative choice to induce cancer ferroptosis39,40.
Iron accumulation happens in the infected cells, while
iron deprivation decreases the survival of the pathogens38,
perhaps even the coronavirus37,41. This may lead to more
effective treatment options for COVID-19.
A hypothesis on the association between COVID￾19 and ferroptosis
Iron is considered a critical player in COVID-19 patho￾genesis42. A basic study used patient-derived SARS-CoV2
(SZ005) to infect African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells
and found the expression of GPX4 was significantly
decreased in mRNA levels, suggesting the association
between SARS-CoV-2 and ferroptosis43. Owing to the lack
of GPX4, GSH cannot be peroxidated to reduce lipid ROS
generated from Fenton reaction. As a result, lipid ROS
accumulation would cause lipid peroxidation and ferrop￾tosis. Clinical studies show that patients with severe
COVID-19, who had no history of underlying kidney dis￾eases, could develop kidney malfunction or damage44–46.
Therefore, it is possible that the ferroptosis contributes to
the renal manifestations of COVID-19. Iron accumulation
takes time and this is probably why COVID-19-induced
damages usually appear at 10–14 days.
Iron metabolism is dysregulated in COVID-19
patients47,48. A clinical study49 enrolled 50 patients diag￾nosed with COVID-19 and investigated their serum iron
levels. They found that 90% of the patients had low serum
iron levels. The serum iron levels were negatively asso￾ciated with the severity of the infection. This was further
confirmed by comparing the serum iron levels prior to the
treatment with post-treatment levels, with the latter being
relatively higher. Another study47 involved 222 patients
and 88.2% of them had dyshomeostatsis with functional
serum iron deficiency, suggesting anemia is prevalent in
COVID-19 patients. Transferrin is the carrier of iron,
transporting it through the membrane and reach to the
cytoplasm18. In this study, both serum iron concentration
and transferrin were significantly lower in the anemic
patients.
The absorption from the intestine and the degradation
of erythrocytes produce Fe2+, which is oxidized into Fe3+
through ceruloplasmin48. The Fe3+ generated can further
bind to membrane transferrin thereby entering the
cells18,48. Iron overload is the primary cause of ferropto￾sis16. Virus replication requires iron to serve as a raw
material, as with human immunodeficiency virus, cyto￾megalic virus, vaccinia virus, herpes simplex virus 1, and
hepatitis B virus38. Therefore, it is likely to be that more
iron will be transferred into the cell, triggering Fenton
reaction and generating excessive lipid ROS, which can￾not be eliminated by the reduced amount of GPX4.
Consequently, ferroptosis may occur due to the dysre￾gulation of iron homeostasis in COVID-19 patients.
Iron enters into the cell through transferrin receptor48,
which also serves as an ideal portal for various micro￾organisms to enter cells50. A study showed that the
expression of transferrin was age-related and male had
significant higher levels of expression compared with
females51. This is associated with the severity of COVID￾19 with the mortality of male and elderly patients was
higher than that of female and young patients1
. Recent
clinical studies showed serum ferritin levels were sig￾nificantly higher in severe COVID-19 patients, with
hyper-ferritinemia compared with the mild cases52,53.
Hyper-ferritinaemia is a condition in which excess ferritin
accumulates in the body. Upon SARS-CoV-2 infection,
interleukin-6 in the cytokine storm increases ferritin and
the production of hepcidin, which plays a key role in iron
regulation. As iron is sequestered by hepcidin in the
enterocytes and macrophages, intracellular ferritin will be
increased, leading to a decreased iron efflux from the
cells54. Therefore, the hyper-ferritinemia in COVID-19
patients is likely caused by cell death and tissue damage,
thereby releasing the intracellular ferritin42,55. High serum
iron might be followed by low iron depending on the
stage. However, the dynamic fluctuations of hepcidin
require further study.
Recent studies showed that labile iron originates from
the degradation of ferritin through autophagy, which is
termed as “ferritinophagy”
56,57. Ferritinophagy requires
nuclear receptor coactivator 4, which is a selective carrier
receptor that transports ferritin to the autophago￾some56,58. Ferritinophagy facilitates ferroptosis through

Fig. 1 SARS-CoV-2, Multiple Organ Failure and the Possible Triggering of Ferroptosis. A Schematic representation of SARS-CoV-2 causing
multiple organ failure (MOF). SARS-CoV-2 recognizes the AEC2 receptor in the alveoli, especially the type II alveolar cells (AT2). This infection triggers
the immune response and inflammation, causing damage to the blood-air barrier. In this case, SARS-CoV-2 therefore passes through the barrier,
reaching to the capillaries and continues recognizing the ACE2 located in the different organs within the blood circulation. As a result, organs
expressed with ACE2 may get infected and damaged by the activated immune system, thereby causing the MOF. B A hypothesis of how SARS-CoV-2
may trigger ferroptosis. After incubation period, the invading SARS-CoV-2 causes cytotoxic effect to multiple organs. Due to the infection, a plethora
of transferrins carrying with Fe3+ are recognized by transferrin receptors thereby entering into the cell. Then, divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1)
transformed Fe3+ to Fe2+, accompanied with iron accumulation in the cell. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), Fe2+, and lipid together cause Fenton
reaction, producing massive lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS). This can be eliminated by glutathione (GSH) with the help of Glutathione peroxidase
4 (GPX4). However, owing to the iron overload, extensive Fention reaction would generate a large number of lipid ROS, causing cell membrane
damage.

degradation of ferritin59 or the bromodomain protein
BRD4 inhibitor (+)-JQ in cancer cells60. Also, the accu￾mulation of intracellular ferritin may indicate the activa￾tion of ferritinophagy61. However, further studies should
be performed to evaluate whether NCOA3 knockdown/
knockout could enhance this accumulation to confirm the
involvement of ferritinophagy in SARS-CoV-2 infection.
It is possible that iron enters and accumulates in the
cells, decreasing the serum iron levels. The accumulated
iron may trigger the increase in intracellular labile iron
(II) pool and Fenton reaction, producing lipid ROS, and
lead to ferroptosis16. This correlates with the risk of severe
and fatal COVID‐19 disease, which is higher in males than
in females and also increases with age49. Several evidences
also reveal the occurrence of significant lymphopenia in a
large proportion of COVID-19 patients2–4,49,62. Recently,
a ferroptosis signature was reported in a case report of
COVID-19 patient (48-year-old, male), showing 4-HNE, a
reactive breakdown product of the lipid peroxides or
oxidized phosphatidylcholine was positive in myocardial
tissue staining and in the proximal tubules of acute kidney
injury, with decreased lymphocytes in the blood63. An
in vitro study also showed SARS-CoV-2 suppressed
GPX4, the brake of ferroptosis43. These studies demon￾strated the involvement of ferroptosis in SARS-CoV-2
infection and its potential contribution to the multiple
organ damage. Nevertheless, the role of ferroptosis in
SARS-CoV-2 infected cells or organs whether it could be
a new hope for the treatment of multiple organ involve￾ment of COVID-19 are still unclear (Fig. 1). In spite of the
existing findings on the involvement of ferroptosis in
SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is no reported study to
uncover how does ferroptosis acts in SARS-CoV-2
infection yet. Uncovering the role of ferroptosis in
SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential to develop new treat￾ment strategies for COVID-19. New generation of fer￾roptosis inhibitors such as the improved ferrostatin-164,65
and liproxstatin-166 analogs not only can serve as the
tools to evaluate the role of ferroptosis in SARS-CoV-2
infection but also might be potential drug candidates for
COVID-19.
Conclusion
In response to the infection of SARS-CoV-2, iron
metabolism dysfunction has been widely documented in a
large proportion of COVID-19 patients, and this may
cause iron accumulation and overload, triggering ferrop￾tosis in the cells of multiple organs. We hypothesis that
ferroptosis is an important cause of multiple organ
involvement in COVID-19 and it might serve as a new
treatment target. Intracellular cell iron depletion or new
generation of ferroptosis inhibitors might be potential
drug candidates for COVID-19. We hope this hypothesis
may launch a new wave of studies to uncover the
association of ferroptosis and SARS-CoV-2 infection
in vitro and in vivo.
