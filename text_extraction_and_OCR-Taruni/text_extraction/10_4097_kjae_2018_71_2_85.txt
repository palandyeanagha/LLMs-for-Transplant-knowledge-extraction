Importance of Cardiovascular Function in 
Liver Transplant Candidates
Liver transplantation (LT) is the only life-saving treatment 
option in patients with advanced liver disease. Deceased-donor 
LT is not frequent but is increasing in Asian countries. Because 
current liver allocation policies follow the severity principle 
wherein patients at highest risk for mortality receive top pri￾ority, anesthesiologists may face severely ill patients more fre￾quently with deceased-donor LT than with living-donor LT. In 
this regard, with the outstanding surgical success of recent LT, 
cardiovascular complications have emerged as the leading cause 
of death after LT, particularly among those with advanced liver 
cirrhosis [1,2]. A large national cohort study of the Organ Pro￾curement and Transplantation Network database also revealed 
that death from cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of 
early mortality (40%), followed by infection (28%), and graft 
failure (12%) [3]. Moreover, the numbers of patients receiving 
LT for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [4] and alcoholic liver 
disease are increasing worldwide. Specifically, these patients are 
associated with one or more cardiovascular risk factors such as 
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, prior cardiovascular disease, left 
ventricular hypertrophy, age >60 years, smoking, hypertension, 
and dyslipidemia [4,5].
Understanding Cirrhotic Cardiomyopathy
As liver cirrhosis (LC) progresses, cardiac dysfunction con￾comitant with pronounced systemic hemodynamic changes, 
characterized by hyperdynamic circulation such as increased 
cardiac output, high heart rate (HR), and decreased system￾ic vascular resistance (SVR) is well known to appear. These 
unique features may mask significant manifestations of cardiac 
 Review Article
Cardiovascular complications have emerged as the leading cause of death after liver transplantation, particularly among 
those with advanced liver cirrhosis. Therefore, a thorough and accurate cardiovascular evaluation with clear comprehen￾sion of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy is recommended for optimal anesthetic management. However, cirrhotic patients mani￾fest cardiac dysfunction concomitant with pronounced systemic hemodynamic changes, characterized by hyperdynamic 
circulation such as increased cardiac output, high heart rate, and decreased systemic vascular resistance. These unique 
features mask significant manifestations of cardiac dysfunction at rest, which makes it difficult to accurately evaluate car￾diovascular status. In this review, we have summarized the current knowledge of heart and liver interactions, focusing on 
the usefulness and limitations of cardiac evaluation tools for identifying high-risk patients.

dysfunction because decreased SVR reduces afterload burden 
to myocardial contraction at rest. However, when challenged 
by physical stress, such as exercise or surgery, a blunted car￾diac contractile response may show limited ability to increase 
ventricular contractility [6–8]. This phenomenon is known as 
cirrhotic cardiomyopathy, which encompasses systolic dysfunc￾tion diastolic dysfunction, and electromechanical abnormalities, 
which are typically identified based on a reduced ejection frac￾tion (EF) [9], an E/A ratio < 1 [10], and electrocardiographic 
changes such as a prolonged QTc interval [11]. Diagnostic and 
supportive criteria for cirrhotic cardiomyopathy proposed by the 
2005 World Congress of Gastroenterology are shown in Table 1
[12]. 
As cardiovascular complications are leading causes of non￾graft related mortality after LT [2], the importance of identifying 
masked intrinsic cardiac dysfunction or decreased capacity of 
cardiac contractility due to external stress has been emphasized. 
However, detecting ventricular dysfunction in a resting state is 
difficult, as marked vasodilation and increased arterial compli￾ance lead to latent or mild cardiac manifestations [13]. Different 
stress tests, using drugs or exercise, have been applied to un￾mask cardiac dysfunction; however, achieving a target HR and 
blood pressure is difficult given the poor functional conditions 
of patients with LC [14]. 
Dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) is recommended 
to discriminate high-risk patients with ischemic heart disease; 
however, the accuracy of DSE varies widely among studies as 
a result of various selection criteria [12] and the inability to 
achieve the predicted target HR to provoke wall motion abnor￾malities. This inadequacy is based on the failure of beta recep￾tors to respond to sympathetic stimulation in patients with LC 
or the use of beta blockers to prevent variceal bleeding. There￾fore, the accuracy of DSE is questionable, and its sensitivity is 
reported as low as 13–14% [15,16]. Nicolau-Raducu et al. [17] 
demonstrated that DSE has 9% sensitivity, 33% positive predic￾tive value, and 89% negative predictive value for predicting early 
cardiac events after LT.
Nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging with the injection of 
vasodilators, such as adenosine or dipyridamole, has controver￾sial value for further vasodilation with adenosine; thus, it may 
be inadequate in already-vasodilated patients with LC [18,19]. 
QT Interval and LT
QT interval prolongation is a characteristic manifestation of 
cirrhotic cardiomyopathy. Since Day et al. [20] first reported the 
association between prolonged QT interval and alcoholic cir￾rhosis, QT interval prolongation has been found in about half 
of all cirrhotic patients, regardless of etiology and is associated 
with the severity of liver disease [21]. Numerous factors, such 
as increased sympathetic activity, electrolyte abnormalities, 
bile salts, hyperinsulinemia, and endotoxin, are involved in the 
pathogenesis of prolonged QT interval [21–23]. Patients with 
QT interval prolongation are at greater risk for malignant ven￾tricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death and have poorer 
survival among the cirrhotic population [21]. 
The QT interval progressively increases from the pre-anhe￾patic stage and remains prolonged in each stage of LT compared 
to baseline during LT surgery. In the anhepatic stage, 54% of 
recipients show marked prolongation of QTc ≥ 500 ms, which 
may increase the potential for developing severe ventricular dys￾rhythmias [24]. Given that arrhythmogenic potential develops 
rapidly at graft reperfusion just before the start of hypotension 
during LT [25], special attention is required to prevent severe 
arrhythmias in patients with a prolonged QT interval. In this 
regard, the clinical impact of severe QT prolongation (≥ 500 ms) 
in the cirrhotic population is an area of further research interest 
and remains to be established. 
Another index of myocardial repolarization lability, known 
as the QT interval variability index (QTVI), represents the 
relationship between the QT interval and HR variability [26]. 
QTVI is a marker of temporal inhomogeneity in patients with 
ventricular repolarization and an abnormality associated with 
re-entrant malignant ventricular arrhythmia. Huh et al. [27]

demonstrated a parallel relationship between QTVI and liver 
cirrhosis severity, which may indicate a link between the severity 
of liver cirrhosis and increased vulnerability to arrhythmias.
Pretransplant Echocardiography and LT
Although measuring left ventricular EF is the gold standard 
for assessing systolic function via echocardiography, it is an 
afterload-dependent index and thus might be insensitive to de￾tect systolic dysfunction in the resting state of patients with LC, 
because it is normal or elevated in patients with advanced LC 
[13,28,29]. In this regard, a recent intriguing study reported that 
an elevated EF is associated with worse outcomes. Bushyhead et 
al. [30] reported that increased EF is associated with a numerical 
but nonsignificant increased risk of development of stage 4 or 5 
chronic kidney disease (sub-hazard ratio, 1.11 per 5% increase 
in LVEF; 95% CI, 0.99–1.24; P = 0.07). In addition, EF ≥ 65% 
is the best cutoff for increased risk for chronic kidney disease 
(sub-hazard ratio, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.06–2.89; P = 0.03). They also 
demonstrated that greater than a mild degree of tricuspid regur￾gitation is associated with significantly increased post-transplant 
mortality in multivariate Cox regression models, and increasing 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is associated with a signifi￾cantly increased risk for hospitalization for myocardial infarc￾tion or heart failure. 
Speckle-tracking echocardiographic techniques, such as 
those based on peak systolic longitudinal strain, have been advo￾cated to identify cardiac dysfunction in patients with LC at the 
resting state, which is considered to more accurately reflect sys￾tolic function than conventional methods [31]. Jansen et al. [32] 
documented a positive correlation between left ventricle con￾tractility, evaluated by speckle tracking echocardiography, and 
Child–Pugh score severity. In that study, patients with increased 
myocardial contractility showed reduced transplant-free surviv￾al, which suggests that increased contractility might be a tool to 
identify pre-transplant patients at higher risk. The authors spec￾ulated that increased contractility in the cirrhotic population is 
a sign of a decompensated cardiac function with sympathetic 
hyperactivation. Therefore, another reliable test to discriminate 
cardiac dysfunction is required in this specific population.
Diastolic dysfunction is a characteristic pattern of cirrhot￾ic cardiomyopathy. The underlying mechanism of diastolic 
dysfunction in patients with LC is considered to be increased 
myocardial wall stiffness attributable to myocardial hypertro￾phy, fibrosis, and subendothelial edema resulting in high filling 
pressures of the left ventricle and atrium [10]. Dowsley et al. [33] 
reported that elevated markers of diastolic dysfunction during a 
pre-LT echocardiographic evaluation are associated with excess 
risk for heart failure and post-LT mortality; early mitral inflow 
velocity/mitral annular velocity (E/e’ ratio) > 10 and a left atrial 
volume index ≥ 40 ml/m2
 are associated with a 3.4-fold and 2.9-
fold increased risk for developing heart failure after LT, respec￾tively. 
Ventriculo-arterial Coupling in LT Candidates
The left ventricle and systemic arteries are anatomically con￾nected in the cardiovascular system; therefore, their interactions 
are key determinants of cardiovascular homeostasis in a normal 
human heart [34,35]. The concept of “ventriculo-arterial cou￾pling (VAC),” which integrates not only ventricular performance 
but also effective arterial load and, most importantly, their in￾terplay, is demonstrated in patients with LC [29]. Shin et al. [29] 
provided new insight into assessing cirrhotic cardiomyopathy to 
discriminate worse outcomes from a conventional echocardio￾graphic examination in the resting state, without using preop￾erative stress tests such as DSE or nuclear myocardial perfusion 
imaging with adenosine.
When analyzing the pressure-volume curve relationship, 
determining an exact slope of end-systolic pressure-volume rela￾tion (ESPVR) is startlingly too invasive, requiring two invasive 
catheters in the left ventricle and inferior vena cava to make an 
occlusive balloon in the human heart. Therefore, invasive ES￾PVR is thought to be reasonable only in animal studies or dur￾ing open heart surgery. In this regard, Shin et al. [29] employed 
a noninvasive technique based on the pressure-volume curve 
relationship of the single-beat methodology proposed by Chen 
et al. [36].
Ventricular elastance (Ees), calculated as the ratio of end￾systolic pressure (ESP) to end-systolic volume, is an index of 
load insensitive ventricular contractility [35], and arterial elas￾tance (Ea), the ratio of ESP to stroke volume, is an index of the 
net measure of arterial load [37]. ESP is defined as 0.9 × systolic 
blood pressure determined by a noninvasive brachial blood 
pressure measurement. Therefore, VAC (the ratio of Ees to Ea) 
could be measured simply by conventional echocardiography 
[36]. 
Shin et al. [29] observed that cirrhotic patients have 
significantly lower Ees, Ea, and VAC values than those of 
matched-control patients with normal liver function. In patients 
with a high model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score (> 
25), those with a VAC > 0.61 had poorer survival outcomes than 
patients with a VAC < 0.50, and this was independently asso￾ciated with the risk of mortality. It is important to understand 
that neither Ees nor Ea alone but the interaction of the coupling 
(= Ea/Ees) value was a significant prognosticator of post-LT 
non-survivors in that study [29]. Specifically, an increase in 
afterload (Ea) without an increase in contractility (Ees) leads to 
ventricular-arterial uncoupling (higher VAC) with a significant 
reduction in stroke volume, ultimately resulting in increased

overall mortality during long-term follow-up, particularly in pa￾tients with high MELD scores. 
In LC patients, afterload (Ea) frequently increases without an 
elevation in contractility (Ees) when the sympathetic nervous 
system is progressively activated, with increased circulating con￾centrations of norepinephrine as LC severity increases, or use 
of norepinephrine/terlipressin in patients with hepatorenal syn￾drome. Such an increase in afterload (Ea) burdens the cirrhotic 
heart and may unmask ventricular dysfunction. 
The VAC study by Shin et al. [29] highlights that cirrhotic 
cardiomyopathy is often latent but can be manifested in situa￾tions with increased afterload (Fig. 1). Integrating both ventricu￾lar and arterial components when assessing cirrhotic cardiomy￾opathy should be considered important, and its simplicity and 
non-invasiveness without additional stress loading to unmask 
cardiac dysfunction further highlights its importance [29,36].
Similarly, Yotti et al. [38] demonstrated that an increase in 
afterload after phenylephrine injection results in a decrease in 
systolic function and cardiac output. They applied the new non￾invasive measures of the left ventricular systolic function using 
the difference in echocardiographic ejection intraventricular 
pressure and validated this procedure using an invasive pres￾sure-volume catheterization study.
Autonomic Nervous System and HR in 
Patients with LC 
The autonomic nervous system is an important regulator of 
cardiovascular homeostasis, and an HR analysis is considered a 
surrogate of vagal and sympathetic disturbances. Therefore, HR 
measurements have been recognized as a prognostic factor in 
many clinical investigations [39–42]. Studies showing reduced 
HR variability, which correlates with disease severity, central 
hypovolemia, and the degree of portal hypertension have also 
been reported [43,44]. Kim et al. [45] found that sympathetic 
withdrawal is associated with hypotension after graft reperfu￾sion during LT. 
Arterial baroreflex function is also an important contribu￾tor to short-term cardiovascular and blood pressure stability. 
Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis are associated with reduced 
baroreflex sensitivity, which is significantly related to hemo￾dynamics and biochemical characteristics [46]. Song et al. [47] 
demonstrated that changes in cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity 
are related to increased ventricular mass in patients with LC. In 
their study, baroreflex sensitivity was inversely correlated with 
left ventricular wall thickness and end-diastolic interventricular 
septum thickness, left ventricular mass index, and HR. 
Patients with LC have an increased resting HR due to hyper￾dynamic circulation, increased circulating catecholamines, and 
cirrhotic cardiomyopathy [48,49]. Kwon et al. [50] demonstrat￾ed that resting HR is associated with all-cause mortality in LT 
recipients and showed that patients with HR >80 beats/min are 
significantly associated with a higher risk for all-cause mortality 
(hazard ratio 1.83) compared to patients with HR ≤65 beats/
min.

though that study was performed 20 years ago, the importance 
of CAD should not be underestimated during LT surgery. 
A previous study reported the prevalence of CAD, which was 
detected by coronary computed tomography angiography in 
LT candidates [52]. Obstructive CAD (≥ 50% luminal narrow￾ing) did not differ between cirrhotic and control groups (7.2% 
vs. 7.9%, P = 0.646); however, non-obstructive CAD was more 
prevalent in matched cirrhotic cases (30.6% vs. 23.4%, P = 0.001). 
In that study, the risk factors of obstructive CAD were older age, 
male sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and alcoholic cirrho￾sis. Similarly, Kazankov et al. [53] reported that the prevalence 
of CAD is not significantly different between cirrhotic patients 
and controls. However, they reported that cirrhotic patients have 
a markedly higher coronary calcium score than controls and 
have a higher prevalence of extensive (≥ 5 coronary segments 
involved; 45% vs. 18%, P = 0.01) and multi-vessel coronary dis￾ease (≥ 2 vessels involved; 75% vs. 53%, P = 0.02).
Kong et al. [54] reported that a coronary calcium score >400 
is an important predictor of early cardiovascular complications 
such as nonfatal myocardial infarction, serious arrhythmia, and 
cardiac death after LT and found that older age, male sex, and 
diabetes mellitus are associated with a coronary calcium score > 
400 in LT recipients [55]. 
Conclusions
LT causes significant and heavy stress on the cardiovascu￾lar system of patients with LC and cirrhotic cardiomyopathy, 
who may experience massive bleeding and transfusion, inferior 
vena cava clamping, severe hypotension, and postreperfusion 
syndrome. Therefore, anesthesiologists should understand the 
pathophysiology of ongoing and postoperative forthcoming 
cardiovascular derangement in LT candidates and must identify 
risky patients preoperatively for successful LT.
