Abstract
The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to a series of clinical
settings from non-symptomatic viral carriers/spreaders to severe illness characterized by acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)1,2. A sizable part of patients with COVID-19 have mild clinical
symptoms at the early stage of infection, but the disease progression may become quite rapid in the later
stage with ARDS as the common manifestation and followed by critical multiple organ failure, causing a
high mortality rate of 7-10% in the elderly population with underlying chronic disease1-3. The
pathological investigation in the lungs and other organs of fatal cases is fundamental for the
mechanistic understanding of severe COVID-19 and the development of specific therapy in these cases.
Gross anatomy and molecular markers allowed us to identify, in two fatal patients subject to necropsy,
the main pathological features such as exudation and hemorrhage, epithelium injuries, infiltration of
macrophages and fibrosis in the lungs. The mucous plug with fibrinous exudate in the alveoli and the
activation of alveolar macrophages were characteristic abnormalities. These findings shed new insights
into the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and justify the use of interleukin 6 (IL6) receptor antagonists and
convalescent plasma with neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 for severe patients.

Results And Discussion
The two body donors of fatal cases with COVID–19 were a 53 years old female and a 62 years old male,
respectively. Both patients had progressively decreased lymphocytes with elevated serum IL–6 and C
reactive protein (CRP) levels in the late stage of disease (Supplementary Table 1), which was consistent
with recent report1,2. The gross anatomy of the lung showed moderate bilateral pleural effusion and
pleural adhesion in the two patients. The hepatization of lung tissues was observed on the cut-surface of
the collapsed and consolidated lungs. The microscopic manifestation of the lung injury was consistent
with diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). Alveolar cavities were filled with a large number of macrophages
with scattered neutrophils and lymphocytes (Fig. 1a). The massive serous (Fig. 1b) and fibrinoid exudate
in the alveolar spaces were shown by the Masson staining (Fig. 1c, d). The acidic mucopolysaccharides
from a large amount of mucinous secretion were observed by the Alcian blue-periodic acid-Schiff (AB￾PAS) staining in the bronchi and bronchioles, terminal bronchioles and pulmonary alveoli (Fig. 1e, f). A lot
of mucus in the distal respiratory tract lined by mucous cells were shown, reminiscent of the morphology
of mucoid adenocarcinoma (Fig. 1g). The peribronchiolar metaplasia (PBM) with interstitial fibrous

Page 4/14
hyperplasia but without invasive growth of atypical cells was observed. The mucous plug with fibrinous
exudate in the alveoli and terminal bronchioles formed the cribriform pattern. The bronchial phlegm
combined with epithelial detachment and fibrinoid exudate was visible (Fig. 1h).
The hyaline membranes and widened alveolar walls with collagen fibers proliferation and lymphocyte
infiltration were observed in alveoli occasionally (Extended Data Fig. 1a, b). Focal or patchy hemorrhage
with fibrinous exudate were seen in the alveolar cavities and interstitial tissues (Extended Data Fig. 1c, d).
The broken alveolar walls flushed by huge hemorrhagic effusion formed the “blood lake”. The endothelial
cells of small pulmonary arteries were swollen and shed (Extended Data Fig. 1e). Mixed thrombi were
present in small veins (Extended Data Fig. 1f).
Intensive loss of bronchiole and alveolar epithelial cells was remarkable (Fig. 2a, b) while abundant
swollen and degenerated alveolar cells desquamated in the alveoli (Fig. 2c, d). Patchy type II
pneumocytes proliferated with atypical changes, including enlarged nuclei, clearing of nuclear chromatin,
prominent nucleoli and suspected viral inclusions (Fig. 2e, f). The notable proliferation of type Ⅱ alveolar
epithelial cells resembled the morphological changes of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia, in situ
adenocarcinomas, or even invasive adenocarcinoma. Thickened alveolar walls and widened interstitial
tissues were accompanied by lymphocyte infiltration and fibroblast proliferation (Fig. 2g, h).
Notably, the alveolar macrophages significantly increased and filled in a part of the alveolar cavities with
scattered neutrophils and lymphocytes. CD68, one of the scavenger receptors, is a well-documented
specific surface marker of macrophages4. The alveolar macrophages were presented in diverse forms,
including aggregation in small clusters (Fig. 3a, b), diffused distribution (Fig. 3c), single macrophage
exhibiting intracytoplasmic phagocytosis, spherical acidophilic hyaline bodies or hemophagocytic
phenomenon (Fig. 3d, e), and multinucleated giant cells (Fig. 3f). Furthermore, using
immunohistochemistry approach, we examined several chemokine and inflammatory cytokines secreted
by alveolar macrophages including IL–6, IL-10 and TNFα with specific antibodies. IL–6 and TNFα were
moderately expressed in macrophages (Fig. 3g, i), while the expression of IL–10 was strong (Fig. 3h).
Besides, extensive and strong expression of Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) was observed (Fig. 3j).
In general, the degree of infiltration of lymphocytes into the pulmonary tissues was much inferior to that
of macrophages, although some focal lymphocyte infiltrations were present in lungs (Extended Data
Fig.2a). CD20-positive B lymphocytes (Extended Data Fig.2b) accounted for a large majority of the
lymphocytes whereas a few CD3-positive T lymphocytes (Extended Data Fig.2c) made up a small
proportion including CD4-strong positive for helper T cells (Extended Data Fig.2d) and CD8-positive for
cytotoxic T cells (Extended Data Fig.2e). Among the inflammatory infiltrating cells, no CD56-positive
NK/T cells (Extended Data Fig.2f) were detected. Neither Programed cell death protein–1 (PD–1) nor PD￾L1 proteins were shown on the surface of lymphocytes (Extended Data Fig.2g, h). None of the
lymphocytes were proven virus-infected by using immunohistochemistry of Rp3-NP specific antibodies
(Extended Data Fig.2i).

We carefully examined the heart and kidney in the two donor bodies. No obvious gross abnormalities
were observed. Nevertheless, microscopical abnormalities were observable in both organs. Multifocal
myocardial degeneration was present in the heart, together with myocardial atrophy and interstitial
fibrous tissue hyperplasia (Extended Data Fig.3a). A few CD20-positive B cells and CD3-positive T cells
were scattered (Extended Data Fig. 3b, c). In the kidneys, normal renal structures were retained. However,
the fibrotic glomeruli and edematous tubular epitheliums (Extended Data Fig.3d) were focally present
with a small amount of infiltrating B (Extended Data Fig.3e) and T lymphocytes (Extended Data Fig.3f). It
is worth noting that no viral particles were found in parenchymal cells in both heart and kidney.
Next, we examined lymph nodes and other lymphoid organs. Notably, lymph nodes in the pulmonary
hilum were swollen whereas splenic volume was slightly reduced with shrunken capsule in the two cases.
Morphological changes of the pulmonary hilum lymph nodes were characterized by an obvious dilation
of cortical sinuses with numerous macrophages (Extended Data Fig.4e). In the spleen, the lymphocytes in
the white pulp were slightly reduced with infiltration of macrophages in the red pulp (Extended Data
Fig.4g). Notably, the hyperplastic type II alveolar epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages, macrophages in
the pulmonary hilum lymph nodes and spleen were all infected by SARS-CoV–2 whereas no obvious viral
infection was found in lymphocytes and mesenchymal cells (Extended Data Fig.4a-h).
An important finding in the present work was the infections of gastrointestinal mucosa cells (Extended
Data Fig.4i) and spermatogenic testicular cells (Extended Data Fig.4k) by SARS-CoV–2 without obvious
histological abnormalities. In addition, the intestinal epithelium cells, submucosa ganglion cells,
spermatogenic Sertoli and Leydig cells were all infected by SARS-CoV–2 (Extended Data Fig.4j, l).
Scrutiny of pathological sections of esophagus, breasts, muscles, stomach, thyroid, bladder and adrenal
glands showed no obvious abnormalities or SARS-CoV–2 infection.
The pathological investigations of severe patients are pivotal for the understanding of pathogenesis of
COVID–19 and assessment of clinical treatments. Lungs are the main damaged organ in severe COVID–
19 patients due to the ARDS, similar to the situation in SARS outbreak of 2003. In this regard, the
common features of lung injuries constituting the main pathological abnormalities somehow mimicked
those in SARS, including: (1) extensive impairment of type I alveolar epithelial cells and atypical
hyperplasia of type II alveolar cells; (2) formation of hyaline membrane, focal hemorrhage, exudation and
pulmonary edema; (3) pulmonary consolidation with infiltration of macrophages, lymphocytes as well
plasma cells; (4) endothelial injury and thrombosis in small vessels and microvascular. Thus, like SARS￾CoV, SARS-CoV–2 was capable of triggering the pathogenesis and resulting in severe dysfunction of
ventilation and gas exchange obstruction in patients5–9.
However, the pathology of lungs with SARS-CoV–2 infection also exhibited some distinct features as
compared to that found in SARS patients. The hyaline membranes in alveoli, which constituted major
anatomical abnormalities leading to gas exchange obstruction in SARS, were uncommon in COVID–19.
On the other hand, we observed mucous plugs in all respiratory tracts, terminal bronchioles and
pulmonary alveoli in COVID–19, and this was neither described in SARS5,7–11 nor in the recently

Page 6/14
reported autopsy studies on COVID–19 patients12,13. Another unique feature of COVID–19 was the
excessive mucus secretion with serous and fibrinous exudation, which could aggravate the dysfunction
of ventilation. These findings suggested the existence of different pathogenic mechanisms responsible
for the hypoxemia between COVID–19 and SARS patients. We found the hyperplasia and peribronchiolar
metaplasia of mucosal epithelium, a phenomenon which might result from the inflammation- induced
pulmonary tissue reparatory processes or even proliferative reaction of cells originated from bronchioles
and terminal bronchioles. We assume that the mucus aggregation in distal respiratory tracts by
peribronchiolar metaplasia of mucosal epithelium as a result of inflammation-induced reparatory
changes should play a part in the sputum suction failure in very severe COVID–19 patients as previously
reported12.
Of particular note, we found the alveolar macrophages with SARS-CoV–2 infection were expressing ACE2,
a well-established receptor for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV–2 (Extended Data Fig.5). It was reported
that SARS-CoV could occasionally be identified in the alveolar macrophages9. In COVID–19 patients, the
extraordinary aggregation and activation of these macrophages could occupy a central position in
pathogenesis of the very severe “inflammatory factor storm” or “cytokine storm”. Therefore, the
spectacular infiltration and activation of alveolar macrophages in COVID–19, especially among patients
with severe and critical stages of ARDS, might represent the shift of classically activated phenotype (M1)
to alternatively activated phenotype (M2) of alveolar macrophages, whereas this shifted property of
alveolar macrophages could contribute to the inflammatory injuries and fibrosis of respiratory tracts14.
To further address the issue of accumulation of macrophages in lung tissues and to explore the potential
function of macrophages in response to SARS-CoV–2, we incubated purified and Fc-tagged spike
proteins (S protein), which contains the receptor binding domain (RBD) responsible for the entry of SARS￾CoV–2 into the host cells15, with white blood cell samples from six healthy donors. The possible location
of the S protein on the surface of these white blood cells was examined by flow cytometry analysis. To
our surprise, the S protein interacted with CD68-expression monocytes/macrophages but not with T or B
lymphocytes, suggesting a direct viral infection of the macrophage/monocytes. We then determined the
expression of ACE2 on the surface of macrophages. Indeed, an expression pattern similar to the binding
of S protein by monocytes/macrophages was observed (Fig. 4b). These findings highlighted the role of
macrophages as direct host cells of SARS-CoV–2 and potential drivers of “cytokine storm syndrome” in
COVID–19.
Additionally, an elevated serum IL–6 was observed in the two cases in this study and also in some other
very recent reports16. These features were similar to the pathogenesis of “cytokine storm syndrome” in
patients with hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis (HLH) or macrophage activation syndrome
(MAS)17,18. The blockage of cytokine storm using anti-IL–6 or IL–6R antibody, such as Tocilizumab, has
promising therapeutic effects and clinical practice in the treatment of MAS or HLH. Therefore, our data
are in support of the beneficial use of anti-IL- 6/IL–6R antibody for the inhibition of alveolar macrophage
activation as well as inflammatory injuries in COVID–19 patients. Recently, the Tocilizumab therapy has
been recommended in the Guideline of Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID–19 (version 7) by the National
Health Commission.

Page 7/14
The fact that the known ACE2-exressing cells19–21, including type II alveolar epithelial cells, alveolar
macrophages, intestinal epithelial cells and spermatogenic cells, were all found infected by SARS-CoV–2
infection suggests the necessarily of clinical tests of SARS-CoV–2 in feces samples and the blockade of
possible fecal-oral transmission22. Infected submucosa ganglion cells in small intestine were never
reported before. Whether it could be the host cells for long-term coexistence of virus or not remains to be
investigated. It is worth noting that remarkable viral infection persisted even at the end stage of COVID–
19, when the viremia was well passed in the great majority of patients. Under this circumstance, use of
specific anti-viral therapy should be encouraged. Recently, our group identified the convalescent plasma
(CP) from recovered COVID–19 to be a specific and effective therapy for this disease, especially in severe
cases, since the overwhelming majority of patients presented high neutralizing antibody titers against
SARS-CoV–2 and the preliminary results of a phase I trial of CP showed very promising effects (Duan K,
ZHANG XX, YANG XM et al, submitted).
Still, some issues remain to be addressed in future studies: first, what are the molecular and cellular
mechanism underlying the infection of alveolar macrophages of SARS-CoV–2 should be illustrated so
that a deeper understanding of the pathogenic role of viral infection and the mechanism for its escape
from immune reaction can be achieved. These studies may accelerate smart drug and vaccine design
targeting vulnerabilities of viral proliferation; Second, in the two cases studied here and in some other
recent reports, there is a remarkable reduction of both CD4 and CD8 cells in the peripheral blood in
COVID–19 patients. A graded decrease of T cells was found with increase clinical severity of COVID–19.
Intriguingly, there is a negative correlation between the extent of T lymphocytopenia and increased IL–6
and Il–8 levels in the serum. The causal relationship between these two phenomena should be
addressed; Third, in this study, no ACE2-expression was found on the surface of T cells, which may
eliminate the possibility of a direct toxic effect of SARS-CoV–2 on distinct subsets of T cell population.
However, only a small number of T lymphocytes were observed in the inflammatory lung tissues. This
situation seems to be a paradox to the initial assumption that the severe T cell reduction could be
ascribed to a tremendous infiltration of T cells into damaged lung tissues in response to the effect of IL–
6 and other cytokines. The detailed mechanism of T cell depletion in severe COVID–19 certainly requires
in-depth study in the future either among patients or in experimental animal models.

Methods
Patients and pathological anatomy
The autopsy and pathological investigations of specimens were performed on body donors of two fatal
cases with COVID–19 in Wuhan Jin Yin-Tan Hospital, Hubei, China. The diagnosis was established
according to clinical symptoms (fever and cough), RT-PCR testing of SARS- CoV–2 and computed
tomographic (CT) scanning examination. The severe hypoxemia caused by respiratory failure and
circulatory failure was considered the critical cause of death in the two patients. Informed consent was

Page 10/14
obtained. This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the National Health Commission
of China. The autopsy procedures were performed in the negative pressure-ventilation P3 Laboratory.
Histological, histochemical and immunohistochemical staining
Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining of the slides of 10% neutral formaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded
tissues was performed and carefully reviewed on each patient. Alcian blue/periodic acid-Schiff (AB-PAS)
staining and Masson staining were carried out for the examinations of mucus, fibrin and collagen fiber in
lung tissues. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on the slides of lung tissues from two
patients. A panel of primary antibodies were used, including the macrophage marker CD68 (Monoclonal
mouse anti-human CD68, clone KP1; 1:100; Dako Omnis, Agilent); T-lymphocyte marker CD3 (Monoclonal
rabbit anti-human CD3, clone SP7; ready-to-use; Dako Omnis, Agilent), CD4 (Monoclonal mouse anti￾human CD4, clone 4B12; ready-to-use; Dako Omnis, Agilent) and CD8 (Monoclonal mouse anti-human
CD8, clone C8/144B; ready-to-use); B-lymphocyte markers CD20 (Monoclonal mouse anti-human CD20cy,
clone L26; ready-to-use); natural killer cell/T cell (NK/T cell) marker CD56 (Monoclonal mouse anti-human
CD56, clone 123C3; ready-to- use), and the markers of Programmed Cell Death–1 (PD–1 Monoclonal
mouse anti-human PD- 1, clone UMAB199; ready-to-use) and Programmed Cell Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1
Monoclonal mouse anti-human PD-L1, clone 22C3; ready-to-use). Antibodies specific for chemokine and
inflammatory cytokines were also used, including interleukin 6 (polyclonal rabbit anti-IL–6 human; 1:250;
abcam), interleukin 10 (IL–10，polyclonal rabbit anti-human IL–10; 1:300; abcam) and tumor necrosis
factor α (TNFα, polyclonal rabbit anti-human TNFα; 1:80; abcam). In addition, ACE2 protein was revealed
using a mouse monoclonal anti-human ACE2 antibody (clone 1G4; 1:160; ORIGENE) while the detection
of /SARS-CoV–2 was performed using the antibody against SL-CoV Rp3 N-protein (Rp3-NP) (1:100; the
Rp3-NP antibody was provided by Prof. Zheng-Li Shi, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of
Sciences).
Flow cytometry analysis
The white blood cells were obtained from six health donors according to manufactures’ instructions of
Red Blood Cell Lysis Buffer (#40401ES60, Yeasen, China). After the removal of the red blood cells, white
blood cells were washed twice with PBS. Cells were firstly incubated with SARS-CoV–2 (2019-nCoV)
Spike Protein (S1 Subunit, Fc Tag) (#40591-V02H, Sino Biological, China) or antibodies against human
ACE2 (#21115–1-AP, Proteintech, China) in DMEM (Gibico) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibico) for 30
minutes at room temperature. The cells were washed and used for flow cytometry labeling. Antibodies
against human CD3 (APC mouse anti-human CD3 monoclonal antibody, clone HIT3a, BD Bioscience),
CD14 (FITC mouse anti-human CD14 monoclonal antibody, clone RMO52, Beckman Coulter), CD68
(PE/Cy7 mouse anti-human CD68 monoclonal antibody, clone Y1/82A, Biolegend) and human IgG (PE
anti-human IgG Fc, clone M1310G05, Biolegend) were used as primary antibodies and rabbit IgG (Alexa
Fluor 546 Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) polyclonal antibody, ThermoFisher) were used as secondary

Page 11/14
antibodies, according to manufactures’ instructions. BD LSRFortessa™ X–20 was used for flow cytometry
analysis.
