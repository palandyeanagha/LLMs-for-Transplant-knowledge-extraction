The role of oxidative stress during inflammatory 
processes
Abstract: The production of various reactive oxidant 
species in excess of endogenous antioxidant defense 
mechanisms promotes the development of a state of oxi￾dative stress, with significant biological consequences. 
In recent years, evidence has emerged that oxidative 
stress plays a crucial role in the development and per￾petuation of inflammation, and thus contributes to the 
pathophysiology of a number of debilitating illnesses, 
such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, or 
neurodegenerative processes. Oxidants affect all stages 
of the inflammatory response, including the release by 
damaged tissues of molecules acting as endogenous 
danger signals, their sensing by innate immune recep￾tors from the Toll-like (TLRs) and the NOD-like (NLRs) 
families, and the activation of signaling pathways ini￾tiating the adaptive cellular response to such signals. 
In this article, after summarizing the basic aspects of 
redox biology and inflammation, we review in detail 
the current knowledge on the fundamental connections 
between oxidative stress and inflammatory processes, 
with a special emphasis on the danger molecule high￾mobility group box-1, the TLRs, the NLRP-3 receptor, and 
the inflammasome, as well as the transcription factor 
nuclear factor-κB.
Keywords: cell signaling; danger signals; inflammasome; 
inflammation; innate immunity; oxidative stress; Toll-like

Introduction
Inflammation represents a fundamental biological process 
that stands at the foreground of a large number of acute 
and chronic pathological conditions. Complex inflamma￾tory networks, involving countless cellular and humoral 
components, orchestrate critical aspects of diseases as 
various as myocardial infarction, diabetes, rheumatoid 
arthritis, sepsis, cancer, or Alzheimer’s disease to name 
only a few. As a direct corollary, clinical and basic research 
in the field of inflammation has been steadily growing, 
illustrated by the 415 000 references retrieved from a 
Medline search with the term ‘inflammation’, among 
which  > 215 000 are  < 10 years old (as of August 2013).
Inflammation occurs in response to any alteration 
of tissue integrity, in order to restore tissue homeosta￾sis through the induction of various repair mechanisms. 
Proper regulation of these mechanisms is essential to 
prevent uncontrolled amplification of the initial inflam￾matory response and a shift from tissue repair toward 
collateral damage and disease development (Goldszmid 
and Trinchieri, 2012). In recent years, evidence has been 
obtained that chemical processes involving redox reac￾tions triggering cellular oxidative stress play critical roles 
in the pathophysiology of inflammation (Liaudet et  al., 
2009; Nathan and Cunningham-Bussel, 2013), a concept 
that had been already proposed almost 30 years ago in a 
milestone review article on the biochemistry of oxidative 
stress (Sies, 1986). The aim of this article is to provide an 
overview of the major mechanisms underlying this link 
between oxidative stress and inflammation.
Oxidative stress and biology of 
free radicals
Many cellular processes are directed by reactions involv￾ing the transfer of electrons between molecules, whose 
redox state (the balance between oxidized and reduced 
forms of electrons donors and acceptors) becomes thereby

modified (Schafer and Buettner, 2001). Redox homeostasis 
is maintained by cellular and extracellular redox buffer￾ing systems, which include small molecule- and protein￾based buffers such as the redox couples GSH/GSSG 
(glutathione-glutathione disulfide), cysteine/cystine, 
and oxidized/reduced thioredoxin (Banerjee, 2012). The 
balance of these buffering systems is maintained by key 
antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase, 
catalase, and the selenoproteins glutathione peroxidase 
and thioredoxin reductase, as well as non-enzymatic 
antioxidants such as α-tocopherol (vitamin E), ascorbate 
(vitamin C), β-carotene, and flavonoids (Steinbrenner and 
Sies, 2009; Chen et al., 2012).
Disruption of redox homeostasis occurs whenever 
an imbalance between reductants (electron donors) and 
oxidants (electron acceptors) develops, resulting either 
in a reductive stress (redox potential becomes more nega￾tive) or an oxidative stress (redox potential becomes more 
positive), the latter being by far the most common form 
of redox imbalance in biological systems (Shao et  al., 
2012). Oxidative stress therefore results from the genera￾tion of various oxidizing chemical species in excess of the 
cellular reducing capacities, and is best defined as ‘an 
imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants in favor of 
the oxidants, leading to a disruption of redox signaling and 
control and/or molecular damage’ (Sies and Jones, 2007). 
Oxidant species include primarily free radicals, which are 
molecules or fragments of molecules containing one or 
more unpaired electrons in their molecular orbitals, and 
which stabilize by removing electrons from neighboring 
molecules. Certain non-radical species, such as hydrogen 
peroxide or peroxynitrite, also act as strong electron accep￾tors due to their highly positive redox potential. The two 
main families of relevant oxidants in biology are the reac￾tive oxygen species (ROS) and the reactive nitrogen species 
(RNS) (Pacher et al., 2007), as summarized in Figure 1.
The family of ROS

Nitric oxide (NO.
) is formed from l-arginine and molecular oxygen (O2
) by the activity of various isoforms of NO synthase (endothelial, neu￾ronal, and inducible NOS). The superoxide radical (O2
.-) is formed during cellular metabolism in the mitochondrial electron transport chain 
(METC) and in the ER, or as a product of the enzymatic activities of NADPH oxidase (NOX), xanthine oxidase (XO), and uncoupled NOS. O2
.- is 
dismutated by superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes to hydrogen peroxide (H2
O2
), which can either be detoxified to water by catalase or 
be converted to the hydroxyl radical (OH.
) in the presence of metal (iron-mediated Fenton reaction). NO.
 and O2

react to form the strong oxidant peroxynitrite (ONOO-

radicals through homolytic fission (rupture of a covalent bond) or through reaction with carbon dioxide (CO2
) of its conjugated acid perox￾ynitrous acid (ONOOH), yielding the carbonate radical (CO3

), through enzymatic- and metal-cat￾alyzed (Fenton) reactions (Jomova et  al., 2010). Further￾more, O2
.- promotes the formation of the potent oxidant 
and nitrating species peroxynitrite, following its sponta￾neous reaction with nitric oxide (see below).
A continuous generation of O2
.- occurs in the mito￾chondria, due to the ‘leakage’ of electrons from the elec￾tron transport chain, mainly at the ubiquinone binding 
sites of complex I and complex III, resulting in the one￾electron reduction of oxygen (Drose and Brandt, 2012). 
Under physiological conditions, approximately 2% of 
oxygen consumed is thus diverted to O2
.- as a by-product 
of mitochondrial respiration. Oxidative damage is pre￾vented by the rapid scavenging of O2
.- by the mitochon￾drial enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase (Dhar and 
St Clair, 2012). The production of ROS may, however, sig￾nificantly increase under various pathological conditions, 
for example, hypoxia or inflammation, which promote 
damage to electron transfer within the mitochondrial 
respiratory chain (Alfadda and Sallam, 2012). Besides 
mitochondria, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is another 
organelle contributing to cellular ROS generation. ER pro￾motes protein folding through the formation of disulfide 
bonds within proteins, mediated by the enzymes protein 
disulfide isomerase and oxidoreductin 1, and coupled to 
the transfer of electrons to molecular oxygen, yielding 
H2
O2
. This process becomes significant under conditions 
of ER stress (triggered, for instance, by inflammatory 
cytokines or high glucose concentration), during which 
accumulation of misfolded proteins within the ER trig￾gers a protective program termed the unfolded protein 
response, associated with an increased ER-dependent 
ROS generation (Laurindo et al., 2012; Popov, 2012).
The production of O2
.- also depends on the activity 
of several enzyme systems, which include primarily the 
various isoforms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 
phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX), present in virtu￾ally every cell type. They exist as seven distinct isoforms 
(NOX1–NOX5 and the dual oxidases DUOX1 and DUOX2), 
structurally composed of a core catalytic subunit and 
various regulatory subunits (p40phox, p47phox, p67phox, 
p22phox, NOXA1, NOXO1, DUOXA1, and DUOXA2) determin￾ing spatial organization, membrane location, subcellular 
expression, and activation of the enzyme (Drummond 
et al., 2011; Segal et al., 2012). Activation of NOX catalyzes 
the transfer of electrons from cytosolic NADPH to molecu￾lar oxygen to form O2
.-. For NOX4 and DUOX1-2, the primary 
ROS produced is H2
O2
 instead of O2
.-.
ROS produced by NOXs regulate multiple cellular 
(e.g., differentiation, proliferation, and migration) and 
physiological (e.g., vascular tone, oxygen sensing) pro￾cesses (Drummond et al., 2011; Segal et al., 2012). Excess 
ROS production and oxidative stress occurs when overac￾tivation of NOX occurs in response to stimuli as diverse as 
hyperglycemia, angiotensin II, growth factors, hormones 
(Schramm et al., 2012), and most significantly inflamma￾tory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β (Ginnan et  al., 
2013) and TNFα (Frey et al., 2002). In addition, activated 
neutrophils and macrophages produce large amounts of 
ROS through the activation of NOX2 during the so-called 
oxidative burst, which is essential for eliminating invad￾ing pathogens but which may also become a significant 
pathway of tissue injury under sterile inflammatory condi￾tions associated with the activation of phagoyctes (Segal 
et al., 2012).
A second important enzymatic source of ROS is the 
xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH)/xanthine oxidase (XO) 
system. XDH is a metalloflavoenzyme converting xanthine 
and hypoxanthine into uric acid during the catabolism 
of purine nucleotides, using NAD+ as an electron accep￾tor. Under inflammatory conditions and during tissue 
ischemia, XDH is converted to XO by oxidation of cysteine 
residues or by limited proteolysis (Engerson et  al., 1987; 
Pritsos, 2000). XO does not reduce NAD+ but uses O2
 as an 
electron acceptor, thereby producing large amounts of O2
.-
and H2
O2
 during purine catabolism (Nishino et al., 2008). 
The crucial role of XO-dependent oxidant generation is 
underscored by the great therapeutic potential of various 
pharmacological XO inhibitors, as recently reviewed 
(Pacher et  al., 2006). Finally, additional enzymes may 
contribute to the formation of ROS, including cytochrome 
P450, cyclooxygenase, and uncoupled NO synthase, as 
detailed below.
The family of RNS
The parent molecule of all RNS is the free radical NO.
, gen￾erated during the conversion of l-arginine to l-citrulline 
by the enzyme NO synthase (NOS) in a five-electron oxida￾tive reaction. Three distinct isoforms of NOS exist, includ￾ing neuronal (type I, nNOS), endothelial (type III, eNOS), 
and inducible (iNOS, type II) NOS. Whereas eNOS and 
nNOS are constitutively expressed, iNOS is expressed de 
novo upon cell activation by inflammatory cytokines and 
microbial products (Forstermann and Sessa, 2012). Under 
physiological conditions, NO.
 functions as a key cellular 
messenger and cytoprotective species by interacting with 
metals and other free radicals, and by modulating the bio￾logical activity of a myriad of proteins through S-nitrosyla￾tion of cysteine residues (Liaudet et al., 2000).

206      J. Lugrin et al.: Oxidative stress and inflammation
Alternatively, NO.
 may become a potent cytotoxic 
effector following its extremely fast reaction with O2
.- (rate 
constant k = 0.38–1.6 × 1010 m-1 s-1) to generate peroxynitrite, 
the prototype of toxic RNS (Pacher et al., 2007). The oxida￾tive chemistry of peroxynitrite depends in large part on the 
secondary formation of free radicals (Figure 1), including 
the hydroxyl radical (.
OH), the carbonate radical (CO3
.-), 
and the nitrogen dioxide radical (.
NO2
). The latter is 
notably responsible for the nitration of tyrosine residues 
within proteins, forming nitrotyrosine, which is used as 
a biochemical marker (‘footprint’) of peroxynitrite forma￾tion in a given situation (Pacher et al., 2007; Szabo et al., 
2007; Ferrer-Sueta and Radi, 2009). By analogy with the 
term ‘oxidative stress’ associated with excessive ROS for￾mation, the terms ‘nitroxidative stress’ (Calcerrada et al., 
2011) and ‘nitrative stress’ (Sugiura and Ichinose, 2011) are 
frequently used to describe the consequences of exces￾sive peroxynitrite formation in a biological system, while 
the term ‘nitrosative stress’ refers to the consequences of 
increased NO production (Pacher et al., 2005).
The generation of peroxynitrite may be significant 
under inflammatory conditions, due to the simultaneous 
generation of increased amounts of NO.
 and O2
.- (Pacher 
et al., 2007). It is also noteworthy that reduced availability 
of l-arginine (the NOS substrate) or tetrahydrobiopterin 
(an essential NOS cofactor) can result in dysfunction of 
NO synthase, by ‘uncoupling’ its reductase and oxygenase 
domains (Kietadisorn et al., 2012). Uncoupled NOS gener￾ates O2
.- instead of NO.
, and thereby favors the formation 
of peroxynitrite. This process has been particularly well 
described in the context of inflammatory cardiovascu￾lar pathologies, most significantly atherosclerosis, as 
reviewed recently (Forstermann and Li, 2011; Alkaitis and 
Crabtree, 2012).
Biological chemistry of ROS/RNS
ROS and RNS introduce various oxidative insults to lipids, 
proteins, and nucleic acids, with consequences ranging 
from subtle modulation of cell signal transduction pro￾cesses to overt biomolecular damage and cell death, as 
illustrated in Figure 2. The one-electron oxidation of poly￾unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) residues may trigger a chain 
reaction of lipid peroxidation in biomembranes, causing 
significant alterations of membrane permeability (Valko 
et al., 2007). Oxidized PUFAs also form various cytotoxic 
aldehydes such as malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxynon￾enal (Devasagayam et al., 2003). The reaction of peroxy￾nitrite with PUFAs can generate nitrated lipids, which may

act as endogenous donors of .
NO and as signaling mole￾cules (Baker et al., 2009; Rubbo et al., 2009).
Several oxidative modifications of proteins may be 
introduced by ROS-RNS. The thiol (-SH) group of cysteine 
residues is a particularly sensitive target of oxidant 
species, forming sulfenic acid, mixed disulfide, S-glu￾tathiolated derivatives, as well as sulfinic and sulfonic 
acid (Shao et al., 2012). Cysteine-bound thiol may also be 
nitrosylated through the addition of an NO group. Such 
S-nitrosylation is a reversible modification playing essen￾tial roles in modulating the function of a great number of 
cellular proteins (Murray and Van Eyk, 2012; Haldar and 
Stamler, 2013). Tyrosine residues may be affected by per￾oxynitrite-mediated nitration, that is, the addition of an 
NO2
 group to the phenolic ring of tyrosine (Castro et al., 
2011). A further oxidative modification of proteins is the 
addition of a carbonyl group such as ketone or aldehyde 
groups (carbonylation) to the side chain of amino acids, 
mainly proline, threonine, lysine, and arginine (Dalle￾Donne et al., 2003). Oxidized proteins may be subject to 
accelerated degradation and loss of function, with poten￾tially significant cytotoxic consequences (Dalle-Donne 
et  al., 2003). For instance, oxidative alterations of mito￾chondrial proteins (mainly induced by peroxynitrite) may 
precipitate apoptotic and necrotic cell death by triggering 
bioenergetic failure (Brown, 2007) and opening of the per￾meability transition pore (Radi et al., 2002). An important 
aspect of redox modifications within proteins relies in the 
modulation of multiple cell signal transduction pathways 
(Burgoyne et  al., 2012). While physiological variations 
of the cellular redox state play a crucial role in cellular 
homeostasis (concept of redox signaling), oxidative stress 
may result in pathological alterations of cell signaling, 
which may notably confer an inflammatory phenotype to 
the cell (Liaudet et al., 2009).
In DNA, oxidants can damage nucleobases, especially 
guanine, resulting in the formation of 8-oxoguanine, 
with potential mutagenic and carcinogenic consequences 
(Valko et  al., 2007). Oxidants can also abstract hydro￾gen atoms from the sugar phosphate backbone of DNA, 
promoting the generation of DNA strand breaks (Cadet 
et  al., 2012). A striking consequence is the activation of 
the nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). 
The latter is a family of 17 enzymes (primarily PARP-1 
and PARP-2), which sense DNA strand breaks to initi￾ate a program of DNA repair through the poly(ADP-ribo￾sylation) of multiple nuclear protein substrates (Bai and 
Virag, 2012; Burkle and Virag, 2013). The catalytic activity 
of PARP consumes substantial amounts of cellular NAD+, 
initiating a secondary depletion of ATP. This may precipi￾tate cell death through the necrotic pathway in conditions 
of overt oxidative stress and PARP overactivation (Bai 
and Canto, 2012). In turn, necrotic cells release various 
intracellular components within the extracellular milieu, 
which trigger inflammatory responses through the activa￾tion of specific innate immune receptors (Kono and Rock, 
2008). It is also noteworthy that PARP enzymes recently 
emerged as important modulators of inflammatory dis￾eases, by affecting immune cell maturation and differ￾entiation and by regulating the expression of multiple 
inflammatory mediators, as extensively reviewed recently 
(Bai and Virag, 2012). These roles of PARP activation in 
promoting necrotic cell death and inflammation have 
prompted the development of a series of pharmacological 
inhibitors with significant therapeutic potential in many 
disease processes (Virag and Szabo, 2002).
Besides PARP, it is also worth to mention the role of 
another DNA repair enzyme in the regulation of inflamma￾tion, namely 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG-1). The 
latter is a base excision repair enzyme that initiates the 
repair of oxidatively modified guanine (Hajas et al., 2013). 
Recent findings have provided evidence that this process is 
paralleled by enhanced immune responses (Mabley et al., 
2005), as demonstrated by significant reduction of inflam￾mation in OGG-1 knockout mice in conditions as diverse 
as endotoxic shock, diabetes, contact hypersensitivity 
(Mabley et  al., 2005), and airway allergy (Li et  al., 2012; 
Bacsi et  al., 2013). The generation of DNA single-strand 
breaks during OGG-1-mediated DNA repair could represent 
the major underlying mechanism, by triggering the activa￾tion of inflammatory transcription factors and the expres￾sion of multiple cytokines (Li et al., 2012; Bacsi et al., 2013).
Inflammation in diseases: the role 
of innate immune mechanisms
Inflammation represents an adaptive response to any con￾dition perceived as potentially dangerous to the host, and 
which aims at the removal of the danger, the induction of 
tissue repair, and the restoration of tissue homeostasis 
(Okin and Medzhitov, 2012). Conceptually, inflammation 
can be viewed as a four-stage process, including a trig￾gering system (the danger), a sensor mechanism (danger 
receptors), the transmission of the signal, and the pro￾duction of mediators, and the activation of cellular 
effectors (Medzhitov, 2008), which may all be affected, 
at various degrees, by reactive oxidants (Figure 3), 
as will be detailed in the next sections. The prototypi￾cal acute inflammatory response, characterized by local 
vasodilation, extravasation of leukocytes, and release of 

208      J. Lugrin et al.: Oxidative stress and inflammation
multiple plasma components, has been particularly well 
worked up in the field of invasion by microorganisms. In 
such infectious conditions, signature molecules released 
by the microbes, termed pathogen-associated molecu￾lar patterns (PAMPs), activate innate immune defenses 
through the activation of the so-called pattern recognition 
receptors (PRRs) and downstream cellular pro-inflamma￾tory signaling, with the ultimate goal of eradicating the 
pathogen (Barton, 2008; Kono and Rock, 2008; Medzhitov, 
2010b). Over the past decade, evidence has been obtained 
that a comparable scenario is set in motion by a wide 
variety of non-infectious stimuli, from exogenous or 
endogenous origin. Thus, the innate immune system 
operates not only to sense ‘self’ vs. ‘non-self’ and to safe￾guard against invading pathogens, but more generally, to 
identify and provide an adapted response to any form of 
danger (Matzinger, 2002) (Figure 3).
Innate immune defense and inflammation: 
the danger model
A multiplicity of danger signals can be sensed by the host. 
Exogenous signals include primarily microbial molecules, 
for example, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and flagellin from 
gram-negative bacteria, lipoteichoic acid from gram￾positive bacteria, and viral RNA (Kawai and Akira, 2006), 
as well as non-infectious molecules, including allergens 
(Holgate, 2012) and airborne pollutants such as silica 
and asbestos (Dostert et al., 2008). Multiple endogenous 
signals are also able to elicit an inflammatory response 
through the activation of innate immune defense mecha￾nisms. These are collectively termed ‘damage-associated 
molecular patterns’ or DAMPS (Kono and Rock, 2008), 
sometimes also referred as to ‘alarmins’ (Chan et  al., 
2012). DAMPs are released in conditions of tissue injury, 
and originate either from dying (necrotic) cells or from 
the breakdown of the extracellular matrix (Medzhitov, 
2010a). Examples of intracellular DAMPs include heat 
shock proteins, S-100 proteins, high mobility group box-1 
(HMGB1), ATP, and DNA (Kono and Rock, 2008). A specific 
subgroup of DAMPs originating from mitochondria (mito￾DAMPs, MTDs) has been also recently described, compris￾ing formyl peptides and mitochondrial DNA (Zhang et al., 
2010). Extracellular DAMPs comprise fibronectin, hyalu￾ronic acid, as well as peptides derived from collagen or 
elastin (Kono and Rock, 2008). Finally, various crystals 
acting as endogenous danger signals can promote strong 
inflammatory response, including monosodium urate 
(Martinon et al., 2009), calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate

The presence of danger signals (either exogenous or endogenous) alert the immune system through PRRs belonging to the Toll-like (TLRs) 
and the NOD-like (NLRs) families, triggering intracellular signaling through the transcription factor NF-κB and the molecular platform 
termed the inflammasome, fostering the production of multiple inflammatory mediators. Oxidative stress affects these processes at several 
levels, including the release of danger molecules, their sensing by PRRs, and their downstream signal transduction systems.

(Martinon et  al., 2009), and cholesterol ester (Duewell 
et  al., 2010). The main endogenous DAMPs and their 
receptors are presented in Table 1.
The appropriate recognition of the danger by the host 
is primordial for the elaboration of proper antimicrobial 
and adaptive responses. Sensing of PAMPs and DAMPs is 
ensured by a complex set-up of PRRs, which include pri￾marily the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (Trinchieri and Sher, 
2007) and the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 
(NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) (Martinon et al., 2009). Other 
PRRs include C-type lectins, the receptor for advanced 
glycation end-products (RAGE), the retinoid acid-induci￾ble gene I-like receptors, and the AIM2-like receptors (see 
Kingeter and Lin, 2012; Miyake and Yamasaki, 2012; Tang 
et  al., 2012b for extensive recent reviews). PRR activa￾tion triggers a wealth of intracellular signaling pathways,

including kinases [for instance, mitogen-activated protein 
kinases (MAPKs), PI3 kinase], adaptors [such as myeloid 
differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88)], 
transcription factors [mainly nuclear factor-κB (NF￾κB), activator protein-1 (AP-1), and interferon regulatory 
factors], as well as the inflammasome in the case of NLR 
activation (see below). Such signaling cascades foster the 
expression of cytokines, chemokines, enzymes, growth 
factors, and additional molecules that are required for 
antimicrobial resistance and tissue repair (Medzhitov and 
Horng, 2009; Tang et al., 2012b).
As stated previously, inflammation represents an 
essential adaptive response aimed at eradicating invad￾ing pathogens and repairing tissue damage elicited by 
noxious stimuli. Appropriate regulation of the mecha￾nisms involved in such adaptation is essential to confine 
the inflammatory response in a localized compartment 
and to promote the switch between inflammation and 
repair, thereby allowing, in fine, the restoration of tissue 
homeostasis (Medzhitov, 2010a). However, there are 
situations in which such restoration may not adequately 
occur, resulting in persistent cellular stress perpetuat￾ing and amplifying the inflammatory response. In these 
conditions, the process becomes maladaptive, leading to 
significant alterations of tissue functions, with systemic 
and persistent derangements of homeostasis (Okin and 
Medzhitov, 2012). Diabetes, atherosclerosis, chronic heart 
failure, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer are typical 
examples of pathological processes associated with such 
chronic inflammatory changes (Pacher et al., 2007).
It is particularly noticeable that the release of ROS has 
long been recognized as a typical consequence of immune 
cell stimulation in vitro (Meier et al., 1989, 1990), and that 
both acute and chronic inflammatory states in vivo are 
coupled with significant alterations of redox equilibrium, 
due to the associated enhancement of oxidant generation 
(Pacher et  al., 2007; Roberts et  al., 2010; Li et  al., 2013; 
Rochette et  al., 2013). Accordingly, mitigating oxidative 
stress by the use of antioxidants has been evaluated as a 
potentially useful anti-inflammatory strategy in such con￾ditions, as recently reviewed (Spychalowicz et  al., 2012). 
Several distinct approaches to reduce oxidative stress 
have been used for this purpose, including natural (e.g., 
vitamin C, thiol compounds, flavonoids, and polyphenols) 
or synthetic (e.g., Trolox, dihydropyridines, edaravone) free 
radical scavengers and antioxidants (Augustyniak et  al., 
2010; Rahman and MacNee, 2012; Carocho and Ferreira, 
2013), enzymatic inhibitors targeting NADPH oxidase 
(Drummond et al., 2011), NO synthase (Feihl et al., 2004), 
xanthine oxidase (Pacher et al., 2006), or PARP (Virag and 
Szabo, 2002), as well as catalytic antioxidants, including 

210      J. Lugrin et al.: Oxidative stress and inflammation
superoxide dismutase mimetics (Muscoli et al., 2003) and 
peroxynitrite decomposition catalysts (Szabo et al., 2007). 
Overall, the results of these innumerable studies have 
clearly pointed out the strong association between oxidative 
stress and inflammation. Notwithstanding, the molecular 
mechanisms underlying the connection of these two funda￾mental biological processes have often not been precisely 
examined. In the next sections of this review, we will there￾fore attempt to fill this gap by presenting the current evi￾dence supporting a mechanistic link binding redox stress, 
innate immunity, and inflammation, by focusing primarily 
on sterile (non-infectious) causes of inflammation.
Role of oxidative stress in 
inflammation
Oxidative stress and inflammatory danger 
signals: the illustrative case of HMGB1
As previously discussed, conditions promoting signifi￾cant oxidative stress may precipitate cellular death and 
extracellular matrix breakdown, due to biomolecular 
damage exceeding any capacity of repair. Necrotic cells 
and damaged ECM in turn release various intracellular and 
extracellular molecules, which act as ‘alarmins’ trigger￾ing inflammatory cascades through recognition by PRRs 
(Chan et al., 2012). Furthermore, oxidative stress conditions 
may induce various modifications within lipids and pro￾teins, generating the so-called oxidation-specific epitopes, 
which act as potent DAMPs able to trigger innate immune 
responses through binding to multiple PRRs. Examples of 
such oxidation-specific epitopes include oxidized phospho￾lipids such as oxidized 1-palmytoyl-2-arachidonyl-sn-glyc￾ero-3-phosphocholine (Imai et al., 2008; Kampfrath et al., 
2011), oxidized cholesteryl esters (Choi et  al., 2009), and 
oxidized low-density lipoporoteins (Lahoute et  al., 2011), 
which are increasingly recognized as key mediators of the 
inflammation associated with the process of atherogenesis, 
as detailed in extensive recent reviews (Miller et al., 2011; 
Greig et al., 2012). As a detailed description of the multiple 
identified DAMPs is beyond the scope of this review, we will 
focus in the next section on the protein HMGB1 to illustrate 
the topics of the relations linking oxidative stress, DAMPs, 
and the development of sterile inflammation (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Role of oxidative stress on the biology of HMGB1.
Excess ROS/RNS promote cell necrosis, leading to the passive release of intracellular HMGB1 into the extracellular milieu. HMGB1 can inter￾act with multiple molecules, including LPS, DNA, lipoteichoic acid (LPT), and IL-1, to elicit inflammatory responses through distinct TLRs. 
Alternatively, HMGB1 can undergo various cysteine modifications depending on the local concentrations of oxidants. In the absence of ROS, 
HMGB1 is in the all thiol conformation, owing to reduced forms of Cys23, Cys45, and Cys106. All thiol HMGB1 interacts with the receptor for 
advanced glycation end-product (RAGE) to promote autophagic responses, and with the chemokine receptor CXCR4, triggering chemotac￾tic responses. In the presence of increasing amounts of ROS, HMGB1 occurs either in the disulfide conformation (oxidation of Cys23 and 
Cys45), which targets TLR4 to initiate inflammatory responses, or in the fully oxidized conformation, due to oxidation to sulfonic acid of its 
three redox active cysteines. This latter form cannot activate inflammatory cells and thus promotes immune tolerance.

J. Lugrin et al.: Oxidative stress and inflammation      211
HMGB1 has been the first DAMP to be characterized 
(Scaffidi et al., 2002) and has been the subject of extensive 
literature over the past decade (Harris et al., 2012). HMGB1 
is a ubiquitous nuclear non-histone protein that binds to 
DNA and participates in DNA replication, transcription, 
and repair (see Andersson and Tracey, 2011 for recent 
review). HMGB1 can be released extracellularly either 
through active secretion by activated monocytes (Wang 
et al., 1999) or by passive release by dying cells (Scaffidi 
et  al., 2002), where it triggers a plethora of actions, 
including inflammation, chemotaxis, maturation of den￾dritic cells, and endothelial cell activation to name a few 
(Andersson and Tracey, 2011). These effects are mediated 
following interactions of HMGB1 with several PRRs, pri￾marily TLR4 and RAGE (Janko et  al., 2013). HMGB1 also 
forms various complexes with many different molecules in 
the extracellular milieu, promoting additional pro-inflam￾matory activities through interaction with TLR2, TLR3, 
TLR9, and the IL-1 receptor (Bianchi, 2009; Janko et  al., 
2013). HMGB1 plays significant roles in the pathophysiol￾ogy of sterile inflammation (Andersson and Tracey, 2011) 
associated with diverse acute and chronic conditions, 
including myocardial infarction (Loukili et  al., 2011), 
hepatic ischemia (Tsung et  al., 2005), stroke (Schulze 
et al., 2013), circulatory shock and trauma (Andersson and 
Tracey, 2011), diabetes (Nogueira-Machado et  al., 2011), 
cancer (Krysko et  al., 2012), and arthritis (Harris et  al., 
2012), and it also acts as a key pro-inflammatory cytokine 
involved in the pathogenesis of sepsis (Yang et al., 2004). 
Thus, HMGB1 emerges as a central acting mediator at the 
intersection between sterile and infectious inflammation 
(Andersson and Tracey, 2011).
Several lines of experimental evidence support a key 
role played by oxidative stress in the process of HMGB1 
release in the extracellular milieu. In a study using iso￾lated cardiomyocytes in vitro, we reported that exposure of 
the cells to toxic concentrations of peroxynitrite induced 
necrotic cell death and was associated with the release of 
copious amounts of HMGB1 (Loukili et al., 2011). Similarly, 
Tang et al. (2007, 2011) reported that treatment of various 
mouse and human cell lines with H2
O2
 promoted significant 
extracellular HMGB1 release, whereas Tsung et  al. (2007) 
showed that oxidants promoted the active release of HMGB1 
by cultured hepatocytes through calmodulin-dependent 
kinase signaling. In vivo, using a rat model of myocardial 
infarction, we reported that a significant formation of per￾oxynitrite occurred in the necrotic myocardium, together 
with HMGB1 accumulation. The elimination of peroxynitrite 
using peroxynitrite decomposition catalysts reduced myo￾cardial infarct size and suppressed the build-up of HMGB1, 
providing direct evidence that peroxynitrite-mediated cell 
death was the key trigger of cardiac HMGB1 accumulation 
during myocardial ischemia (Loukili et  al., 2011). Thus, 
HMGB1 release represents a common response to the cel￾lular stress imposed by free radicals and oxidants in vitro
and in vivo, thereby representing an important mechanism 
linking redox stress and inflammation.
It is particularly noteworthy that HMGB1, while being 
released by oxidatively damaged cells, is also extremely 
redox sensitive, due to the presence of three critical 
cysteine residues. HMGB1 consists of two DNA binding 
motifs, box A and box B, and an acidic C-terminal tail. 
Box A possesses two vicinal cysteines (Cys23 and Cys45), 
whereas box B bears one single cysteine in position 106 
(Cys106) (Tang et  al., 2012a). Depending on the par￾ticular redox environment, three distinct redox forms of 
HMGB1 can therefore be present: all thiol-HMGB1 (three 
cysteines in reduced SH form), disulfide HMGB1 (pres￾ence of a disulfide bridge between Cys23 and Cys45 in box 
A), and fully oxidized HMGB1 (oxidation to sulfonate of 
Cys23, Cys45, and Cys106) (Tang et al., 2012a) (Figure 4). 
According to recent investigations, the recognition of the 
different redox conformations of HMGB1 may help devise 
specific pharmacological inhibitors, with potential thera￾peutic activity against HMGB1-dependent inflammation 
(Gero et al., 2013).
Among these distinct redox forms, only disulfide 
HMGB1 has the ability to bind TLR4 and to promote innate 
immune responses (Tang et al., 2012a), as long as Cys106 
is, at the same time, in a reduced conformation (Yang 
et  al., 2013). In contrast, all thiol HMGB1 cannot bind 
to TLR4, but has been associated with the induction of 
autophagic responses in target cells through binding to 
the RAGE receptor (Kang et al., 2011). In addition, all thiol 
HMGB1 forms a complex with the chemokine CXCL12, 
to promote strong chemotactic responses on leukocytes 
through binding to the receptor CXCR4 (Venereau et  al., 
2012). These two distinct redox forms of HMGB1 are mutu￾ally exclusive, which implies that, depending on the par￾ticular microenvironment, HMGB1 functions either as 
a chemoattractant or as an inducer of cytokine release 
(Tang et  al., 2012a; Venereau et  al., 2012). In conditions 
of tissue injury in vivo, both redox forms of HMGB1 have 
been shown to be sequentially present (all thiol followed 
by disulfide), indicating that HMGB1 successively orches￾trate leukocyte recruitment and the induction of cytokine 
secretion by adopting distinct redox conformations (Tang 
et al., 2012a; Venereau et al., 2012). Finally, fully oxidized 
HMGB1 loses both chemoattractant and pro-inflammatory 
activities, but instead triggers immunologic tolerance 
by preventing the activation of dendritic cells, which 
might explain the lack of inflammation associated with 

212      J. Lugrin et al.: Oxidative stress and inflammation
apoptotic cell death (Kazama et  al., 2008; Peter, 2008). 
Indeed, during apoptosis, mitochondrial production of 
ROS appears sufficient to promote the full oxidation and 
complete inhibition of HMGB1 (Kazama et al., 2008; Peter, 
2008).
In addition to oxidative modifications, HMGB1 can 
also undergo acetylation of key lysine residues located 
within its nuclear localization sequence. This promotes 
the accumulation of HMGB1 within the cytoplasm, by pre￾venting its nuclear re-entry, resulting in the active release 
of HMGB1 by monocytes/macrophages, particularly under 
conditions of inflammasome activation (Lu et  al., 2012). 
The various posttranslational modifications of HMGB1 
(oxidation and acetylation) have been the subject of an 
outstanding recent review by Yang et al. (2013).
To complete the picture of HMGB1-oxidant stress 
interactions, it is worth mentioning that HMGB1 itself may 
induce significant redox modifications by fostering the 
cellular generation of ROS and RNS (Janko et  al., 2013). 
HMGB1-dependent activation of TLR4 triggers the upregu￾lation of multiple genes, among which the genes encoding 
NOX and iNOS. Fan et al. (2007) showed that stimulation 
of ploymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) in vitro with 
recombinant HMGB1 caused TLR4-dependent activation 
of NOX and subsequent increased ROS production. Using 
an experimental model of hemorrhagic shock in mice, 
these authors then reported that hemorrhagic shock was 
associated with significant increases of HMGB1 levels in 
most organs, together with a marked induction of NOX 
in PMNs, which could be abrogated both by TLR4 sup￾pression and by neutralizing antibodies to HMGB1 (Fan 
et al., 2007). In another study by Sappington et al. (2002), 
incubation of Caco-2 human enterocytic monolayers with 
recombinant human HMGB1 resulted in enhanced expres￾sion of iNOS, increased generation of NO and peroxyni￾trite, together with an increased epithelial permeability, 
which could be abrogated by strategies removing NO and 
peroxynitrite (Sappington et  al., 2002). Thus, it appears 
that oxidative stress represents both a cause and a conse￾quence of HMGB1 release in multiple situations, and one 
may envision that such crosstalk might promote a vicious 
cycle of progressive inflammatory amplification.
Role of oxidative stress in the 
biology of PRRs
Toll-like receptors
TLRs are key components of the innate immune system 
(Figure 5), whose primary function is to sense danger 
signals released from pathogens (PAMPs). They are type 
I transmembrane proteins composed of an extracytoplas￾mic, leucine-rich repeat domain for ligand recognition, 
a short transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic Toll/
IL-1 receptor (TIR) homology domain for signal transduc￾tion (O’Neill and Bowie, 2007). Ten TLRs are expressed 
in humans, among which only TLR10 has no identified 
ligand thus far. TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR6 are 
present in the plasma membrane to sense surface com￾ponents of microbes. TLR2, which forms homodimers 
and heterodimers with TLR1 and TLR6, and which uses 
various coreceptors such as CD14, CD36, and Dectin-1, rec￾ognizes bacterial lipopetides and peptidoglycans as well 
as mannans and glucans from fungal origin. TLR4, with 
the coreceptor MD-2, senses the complex formed by bac￾terial LPS and CD14, and TLR5 detects bacterial flagellin. 
TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 are expressed in intracellular 
compartments (ER, endosomes, lysosomes, and endolys￾osomes) where they sense viral and bacterial nucleic acids 
(Lee et al., 2012; Song and Lee, 2012).
As previously discussed, TLRs also detect endoge￾nous DAMPs released from damaged cells and extracellu￾lar matrix, comprising proteins, fatty acids, lipoproteins, 
proteoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans (mainly detected 
by TLR4, and, to a lesser extent, TLR2), as well as nucleic 
acids and protein-nucleic acid complexes (detected by 
TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9) (see Piccinini and Midwood, 
2010 for extensive review). Several differences in the rec￾ognition of PAMPs and DAMPs (different binding sites, 
different coreceptors and accessory molecules), and the 
engagement of distinct regulatory pathways may help 
discriminate exogenous from endogenous dangers. Most 
notably, DAMP recognition triggers negative feedback 
mechanisms to limit the potential damage to the host, 
and recent findings support an essential role for sialoside￾based pattern recognition by members of the Siglec family 
in such negative regulation (Chen et al., 2009; Liu et al., 
2011).
All TLRs, with the exception of TLR3, interact with the 
adaptor MyD88. The endosomal TLR7, TLR8, TLR9 and 
the cell surface TLR5 directly link MyD88, whereas TLR1, 
TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 present on cell surface additionally 
recruit the linker protein TIR domain-containing adaptor 
protein (TIRAP also known as MAL) that connects TLRs 
and MyD88 TIR domains. Upon ligand binding, TLR3 and 
TLR4 recruit the protein TIR domain-containing adaptor 
inducing interferon-β (TRIF) either directly for TLR3 or by 
the intermediate of TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM) 
for TLR4 (Gay and Gangloff, 2007; Song and Lee, 2012). 
MyD88 activates the IRAK-TRAF6-TAK1 axis that turns on 
inhibitor of κB (IκB) kinase (IKK) and MAPKs, which lead 

J. Lugrin et al.: Oxidative stress and inflammation      213
to the activation of NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factors, 
respectively (Kawai and Akira, 2010; Song and Lee, 2012).
Oxidative stress and Toll-like receptors: role of oxidants 
in TLR activation
It has been known for a long time that conditions asso￾ciated with significant oxidative stress trigger enhanced 
responsiveness of cells from the innate immune system 
to pro-inflammatory stimuli (Botha et al., 1995; Fan et al., 
1998). The underlying mechanism has remained elusive 
until recently, when it was proposed that oxidants may 
prime immune cells (‘reprogramming’) by upregulating 
TLR-dependent signaling (Figure 5). In a milestone study 
by Powers and coworkers (2006), exposure of rodent mac￾rophages to oxidants, either in vivo (using an experimental 
model of hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation) or in vitro
(using direct macrophage activation with H2
O2
), induced a 
significant increase in the surface levels of TLR4, as well 
as an increased responsiveness of cells to LPS. This effect 
was dependent on exocytosis of TLR4 from cytoplasmic 
compartments, as it could be suppressed by disruption 
of the cytoskeleton. Most important, the translocation of 
TLR4 into the cell membrane colocalized with the lipid 
raft marker ganglioside GM1, implying the redistribution 
of TLR4 within lipid rafts (which are ‘floating’ microdo￾mains within cell membranes, serving as signaling plat￾forms). Finally, preventing TLR4 movement to lipid rafts 
using methyl-β-cyclodextrin suppressed the increased cel￾lular responsiveness to LPS exposure to oxidants (Powers 
et al., 2006).
The study by Powers et  al. emphasizes the crucial 
importance of receptor trafficking in the regulation of the 
ability of TLRs to sense their ligands, an issue that has 
been reviewed recently by McGettrick and O’Neill (2010). 
The essential role of oxidants in such process, as dem￾onstrated in the above-discussed study, has been further 
confirmed by Nakahira et al. (2006), who showed that the 
trafficking of TLR4 to lipid rafts in response to LPS was 
entirely dependent on ROS produced secondary to the 
activation of NOX in RAW 264.7 murine macrophages. 
Similarly, Wong et  al. (2009) demonstrated that a NOX￾dependent generation of ROS was necessary for TLR4 
recruitment and dimerization within membrane lipid rafts 
of cultured macrophages exposed to LPS, and additional 
studies have suggested comparable effects of oxidants in

Figure 5 Interactions between oxidative stress and Toll-like receptors.
TLRs form active dimers within specific lipid rafts containing various amounts of phospholipids, cholesterol, and sphingolipids in the cell 
membrane. The extracellular domain connects through a transmembrane domain to the cytoplasmic TIR domain, which interacts with 
adaptor molecules such as MyD88 and TRIF to activate downstream signaling through NF-κB, AP-1, and interferon-regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3). 
Consequently, the expression of inflammatory mediators is upregulated, comprising notably pro-oxidant enzymes such as NOX and iNOS, 
producing high levels of ROS. TLR engagement also facilitates the generation of ROS within mitochondria, and promotes activation of NOX 
through direct interaction at the cell membrane or through enhanced phosphorylation of its p47phox subunit within the cytoplasm. The 
resulting increase in intracellular ROS favor the mobilization and dimerization of TLRs within lipid rafts, creating a cycle of progressive 
amplification of the TLR response.

the membrane localization of TLR2 (Frantz et  al., 2001; 
Dasu et  al., 2008; Paul-Clark et  al., 2009). The precise 
mechanisms of oxidant-mediated lipid raft modifications 
remain only partially elucidated. They involve, at least 
partly, alterations in lipid raft annexin VI content, activa￾tion of calcium-dependent kinases, and the generation of 
ceramide. In turn, such modifications may result in modi￾fications of lipid raft density and protein composition, 
with subsequent stimulation of TLR complex assembly 
(Cuschieri and Maier, 2007; de la Haba et al., 2013).
Role of TLR activation in the generation of oxidants
The previous paragraphs have highlighted the importance 
of oxidants in the activation of TLRs, by promoting their 
trafficking to the cell membrane. We will now focus on 
the opposite mechanism, that is, the induction of oxidant 
production in response to TLR activation (Figure  5). 
Increasing evidence is indeed accumulating showing that 
the formation of ROS represents an essential pathway 
of TLR-dependent signaling in cells from immune and 
non-immune origin, which occurs mainly through the 
activation of various NOX isoforms (Tsung et  al., 2007; 
Ogier-Denis et  al., 2008; Gill et  al., 2010). In addition, 
the pro-inflammatory signaling cascades triggered by 
TLR engagement enhance the expression of iNOS, and 
thus promotes the generation of NO (Lewis et  al., 2011; 
Shweash et al., 2011). In turn, the concomitant generation 
of O2
.- (by NOXs) and NO.
 (by iNOS) results in the formation 
of peroxynitrite and other toxic RNS, implying that TLR 
activation may result both into oxidative and nitroxidative 
stress (Jozsef et al., 2006; Lucas and Maes, 2013).
While TLR-dependent oxidant formation is impor￾tant to promote killing of invading pathogens (West et al., 
2011), it may also result in significant cytotoxicity and col￾lateral tissue injury in conditions of sterile inflammation. 
Additionally, oxidants may facilitate further TLR activa￾tion, resulting in a cycle of progressive amplification of 
the initial inflammatory response. This process, which has 
been designed as the ‘TLR-radical cycle’, may represent 
an important mechanism in the maintenance of chronic 
inflammation in multiple human diseases, including car￾diovascular diseases, diabetes, or neurodegenerative pro￾cesses, as reviewed recently (Lucas and Maes, 2013).
The activation of NOX enzymes appears as a key 
process linking TLRs with secondary ROS generation. 
Such activation of NOX appears to result from several 
mechanisms, including (1) increased NOX protein expres￾sion, (2) stimulated assembly of the NOX subunits, and 
(3) direct interactions between NOX and the TIR domain 
of TLRs. Increased NOX expression has been notably well 
documented for NOX1 present in cells from gastrointes￾tinal origin. NOX1 upregulation occurred in gastric epi￾thelial cells in response to TLR4 activation by LPS from 
pathogenic Helicobacter pylori strains, and was shown to 
promote the induction of TNFα or cyclooxygenase 2 mRNA 
expression. This implies that NOX1 could be significantly 
involved in the pathogenesis of chronic gastric inflamma￾tion induced by H. pylori infection (Kawahara et al., 2005). 
Induction of NOX1 has also been evidenced in multiple 
colon cancer cell lines, including T84 (Kawahara et  al., 
2004), SW480, SW620, and CT-26 cells (O’Leary et  al., 
2012), as a result of TLR4 (O’Leary et al., 2012) and TLR5 
(Kawahara et  al., 2004) activation by LPS and flagellin, 
respectively. NOX1-dependent ROS production in these 
conditions promoted the release of the major chemokine 
IL-8 (Kawahara et  al., 2004), and also greatly facilitated 
the adhesion of colon cancer cells to collagen I (O’Leary 
et al., 2012), implying a possible role in the establishment 
of intestinal inflammatory processes, as well as in increas￾ing the metastatic potential of colon cancer cells.
The second important mechanism of TLR-mediated 
NOX activation is represented by stimulated assembly of 
the NOX subunits, particularly well documented in the 
case of NOX2 expressed by phagocytes. Various agonists 
of TLR2 (Huang et al., 2009), TLR4 (Bae et al., 2009; Kamp￾frath et al., 2011), and TLR7/8 (Makni-Maalej et al., 2012) 
promoted NOX2 activation by triggering phosphorylation 
of its p47phox subunit. Deciphering the underlying signal￾ing mechanisms revealed a crucial role of MyD88 (Laroux 
et al., 2005), IRAK4 (Pacquelet et al., 2007; Picard et al., 
2007), and phospho-p38 (Yang et  al., 2008a; Makni￾Maalej et al., 2012) signaling pathway in the upregulated 
p47phox phosphorylation. Finally, activation of NOX may 
also result from direct interactions between TLRs and 
NOX, as indicated in a study by Park et al. (2004). Using 
yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down assays, these authors 
showed that the carboxy-terminal region of NOX4 directly 
interacted with the cytoplasmic tail of TLR4 in HEK293T 
cells. Stimulation of TLR4 with LPS in this system induced 
ROS generation followed by NF-κB activation, pointing 
to direct interaction between TLR4 and NOX4 as a criti￾cal mechanism regulating TLR-dependent innate immune 
responses (Park et al., 2004).
Generation of ROS secondary to TLR engagement does 
not only rely on the activation of NOX but also depends on 
the mitochondria (Figure 5). West and coworkers (2011) 
reported that the engagement of various TLRs (TLR1, 
TLR2, and TLR4) augmented mitochondrial ROS produc￾tion by inducing the recruitment of mitochondria to mac￾rophage phagosomes. This response occurred through 
the translocation of the adaptor TRAF6 to mitochondria, 

J. Lugrin et al.: Oxidative stress and inflammation      215
leading to ubiquitination and enrichment at the mito￾chondrial periphery of ECSIT (evolutionarily conserved 
signaling intermediate in Toll pathways), a protein impli￾cated in mitochondrial respiratory chain assembly, with 
subsequent mitochondrial generation of ROS. The impor￾tance of this process in antibacterial defense was critical, 
in view of the significant impaired capacity of ECSIT- and 
TRAF6-depleted macrophages to kill intracellular bacteria 
(West et al., 2011). However, it remains thus far unknown 
whether a similar mechanism accounts for TLR-depend￾ent oxidative stress under sterile conditions.
To sum up, significant evidence has been obtained 
in recent years that TLR-ROS/RNS interactions are instru￾mental in the induction and maintenance of innate 
immune responses. One may argue that targeting this 
‘TLR-radical cycle’ might prove useful to prevent or treat 
many chronic inflammatory diseases (Lucas and Maes, 
2013). Still, given the critical importance of TLR-depend￾ent ROS generation in the elimination of invading patho￾gens, impaired infectious control might well represent an 
important drawback of such strategy. Many issues need to 
be addressed to pinpoint how the organism discriminates 
between exogenous from endogenous danger signals and 
whether distinct signaling pathways modulate TLR-medi￾ated responses during infectious and sterile inflamma￾tion, in order to manipulate safely the TLR machinery for 
the therapy of chronic inflammatory diseases.
NOD-like receptors and inflammasomes
NLRs are located in the cytosol and sense a wide range 
of PAMPs and DAMPs. NLRs possess a common structure 
characterized by C-terminal leucine-rich repeat domain 
for ligand sensing, a central nucleotide-binding and oli￾gomerization domain for activation, and an N-terminal 
domain for downstream signaling whose structure defines 
different subfamilies of NLRs (NLRA, NLRB, NLRC, NLRP, 
and NLRX) (Kersse et al., 2011). Upon activation, NLRs of 
the NLRP or NLRC families form multiprotein complexes 
termed inflammasomes, following assembly with the 
adapter protein ASC (apoptosis associated speck-like con￾taining a CARD domain) and caspase-1. Once activated, 
the inflammasome platform promotes caspase-1-mediated 
cleavage and maturation of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into 
mature IL-1β and IL-18, which are critical to the develop￾ment of inflammation (Martinon et al., 2009).
The NLRP3 inflammasome (also termed cryopirin 
or NALP3) has been thus far the best-studied member of 
this wide family (Figure 6). Two signals are required for 
full NLRP3 activation, including, first, a TLR-dependent 
activation of NF-κB, resulting in the upregulation of 
NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β expression (‘priming’), and, second, 
an NLRP3 activating signal, which comprises multi￾ple foreign and endogenous molecules (Franchi et  al., 
2012). Foreign signals comprise multiple pathogens and 
PAMPs that enter the cytosol, including bacteria (notably 
Staphylococcus, Listeria, Clostridium, and Escherichia coli
species), fungi (mainly Candida and Aspergillus species), 
and viruses (for instance, adenovirus and influenza virus) 
(Davis et  al., 2011). The activation of NLRP3 in response 
to invading pathogens mainly depends on the release of 
pore-forming toxins by bacteria (such as hemolysin from 
Staphylococcus aureus and toxin A from Clostridium diffi￾cile) (Koizumi et al., 2012), the release of double-stranded 
RNA by viruses (Yu and Levine, 2011), and the release 
of hyphal fragments and the activation of the Syk tyros￾ine kinase by fungi (Said-Sadier et  al., 2010). Besides 
microbes, several non-infectious foreign molecules are 
robust activators of NLRP3, notably crystalline structures 
responsible for occupational lung inflammatory diseases 
(silica and asbestos) and particulate structures such as 
Co-Cr-Mo alloy metal particles used in prosthetic orthope￾dic material (Caicedo et al., 2009) and metal nanoparticles 
such as titanium dioxide, used as a pigment in paint and 
cosmetics (Yazdi et al., 2010).
Multiple endogenous signals derived from the host 
itself have the ability to trigger NLRP3 activation, leading 
to a variety of acute and chronic inflammatory processes. 
Diverse crystals, including monosodium urate, calcium 
pyrophosphate dehydrate, and calcium oxalate, potently 
activate NLRP3 to induce joint inflammation in crystal￾induced arthritis such as gout and pseudogout (Busso and 
Ea, 2012), as well as renal damage in crystalline nephro￾pathy (nephrocalcinosis) (Mulay et al., 2013). Cholesterol 
crystals can also be sensed by NLRP3, promoting IL-1β￾dependent inflammation in the vascular wall, a critical 
process involved in atherogenesis (Duewell et al., 2010). In 
the central nervous system, NLRP3 activation in the micro￾glia due to sensing of extracellular insoluble β-amyloid 
peptide aggregates represents a key mechanism of neuro￾inflammation involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer 
disease (Heneka et  al., 2013). NLRP3 is also activated 
during tissue injury, mainly by hyaluronan released from 
damaged ECM (Yamasaki et al., 2009) and by ATP released 
by dying cells (Iyer et  al., 2009; Silverman et  al., 2009; 
Riteau et al., 2010; Davis et al., 2011), fostering the develo￾pment of sterile inflammation in conditions as various 
as ischemia (Sandanger et  al., 2013), cancer (Zitvogel 
et al., 2012), circulatory shock (Xu et al., 2013), and toxic 
organ injury, e.g., acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity 
(Imaeda et al., 2009). Recent findings also indicated that 

216      J. Lugrin et al.: Oxidative stress and inflammation
NLRP3 contributes to a large extent to the development of 
tissue fibrosis during chronic inflammatory processes (Xu 
et al., 2012; Negash et al., 2013), at least in part by aug￾menting TGF-β signaling (Wang et al., 2013). Furthermore, 
inflammasome activation and IL-1β production also play 
an important role in the development and perpetuation of 
inflammation during metabolic syndrome, insulin resist￾ance, and type 2 diabetes (De Nardo and Latz, 2011; Wen 
et al., 2012). Here, high glucose concentration, lipids (pal￾mitate, ceramide), and islet-derived amyloid polypeptide 
represent the main triggers for NLRP3 activation (Menu 
and Vince, 2011; Zambetti et al., 2012).
Activation of NLRP3: the role of oxidative stress
The large number of known activators of NLRP3 makes it 
highly unlikely that NLRP3 directly senses all these dif￾ferent triggers. Instead, it is now generally acknowledged 
that NLRP3 activation occurs mainly as a consequence of 
a common form of cellular stress elicited by the different 
stimuli (Lamkanfi and Dixit, 2012). Three main putative 
mechanisms are currently considered for such activation 
(Figure 6). The first one, termed the channel model, is 
related to K+ efflux from the cell (Tschopp and Schroder, 
2010). In this model, K+ efflux is consecutive to the activa￾tion of the purinergic P2X7
 receptor by extracellular ATP 
and the subsequent formation of pores by the recruitment 
of pannexin-1 (Pelegrin and Surprenant, 2006), or is elic￾ited by microbial pore-forming toxins such as nigericin 
and hemolysin (Lamkanfi and Dixit, 2012). The second 
one, termed the lysosome rupture model (Tschopp and 
Schroder, 2010), depends on the destabilization and the 
rupture of the phagolysosome compartment, especially 
following the digestion of particulate material, and which 
results in the release of the lysosomal protein cathepsin 
B as an activator of NLRP3 (Hornung et al., 2008). Recent

Figure 6 Role of oxidative stress on the process of NLRP3 activation.
The activation of TLRs by pathogen- or damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs, DAMPs) results in an increased expression of NLRP3, 
pro-IL-1β, and pro-IL-18 (priming stage). Activation of NLRP3 occurs through three distinct mechanisms: (A) K+ efflux in response to the 
opening of K+ channels, the presence of bacterial pore-forming toxins, or the activation of the purinergic receptor channel P2X7 by extracel￾lular adenosine. (B) The release of cathepsin B by activated phagolysosomes. (C) Mitochondrial damage and ROS production. ROS can 
either separate thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) from its inhibitor thioredoxin (TRX), and TXNIP directly activates NLRP3. Damaged 
mitochondria also release oxidized DNA (Ox mtDNA) that activates NLRP3, or may be transported by microtubules (mtb) to the ER due to 
NAD+ shortage, bringing in close proximity NLRP3 with the adaptor ASC (apoptosis associated speck-like containing a CARD domain). Ulti￾mately, activated NLRP3 associates with ASC and caspase-1 in a multiprotein platform termed the inflammasome, which converts pro-IL-1β
and pro-IL-18 into mature cytokines.

J. Lugrin et al.: Oxidative stress and inflammation      217
data have indicated that a similar mechanism triggers 
NLRP3 activation in myeloid cells exposed to chemother￾apeutic agents such as gemcitabine and 5-fluorouracil 
(Bruchard et al., 2013).
The third model, termed the ROS model (Tschopp and 
Schroder, 2010), implicates the formation of ROS, deregu￾lation of cellular redox status, and mitochondrial stress 
as key mechanisms in the process of NLRP3 activation 
(Rubartelli et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2011; Rubartelli, 2012). 
Two main arguments support this model. First, it is partic￾ularly noteworthy that all NLRP3 activators are capable of 
inducing intracellular ROS generation, and second, treat￾ment with various ROS scavengers can block NLRP3 acti￾vation by multiple agonists (Tschopp and Schroder, 2010). 
This later argument remains, however, controversial, 
owing to the fact that ROS inhibitors also inhibit the upreg￾ulation of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β (mechanism of ‘priming’), 
which may occur independently from the mechanism of 
NLRP3 activation (Bauernfeind et  al., 2011). A possible 
molecular link connecting oxidative stress with NLRP3 
activation has been proposed by Zhou et al. (2010) to be 
a protein termed TXNIP (thioredoxin-interacting protein). 
TXNIP is a member of the α-arrestin protein superfamily, 
which binds to the antioxidant protein thioredoxin (TRX), 
acting as a negative regulator of the TRX reductase activ￾ity (Yoshioka et al., 2012). In their study, Zhou et al. (2010) 
first showed that TXNIP has the ability to bind to NLRP3 in 
human embryonic kidney T cells. They then showed that 
various NLRP3 agonists, including monosodium urate 
(MSU) and the imidazoquinoline imiquimod (R-837), pro￾moted the association of NLRP3 with TXNIP, followed by 
inflammasome assembly and secretion of IL-1β by THP-1 
cells. The interaction between TXNIP and NLRP3 was 
dependent on the secondary generation of ROS induced 
by MSU and R-837, which prompted the dissociation of 
TXNIP from TRX and its subsequent binding to NLRP3 
(Zhou et al., 2010). This role of TXNIP has been debated, 
as it could not be reproduced in a further study by Masters 
et al. (2010), who used islet amyloid polypeptide and ATP 
as NLRP3 activators in mouse bone marrow-derived mac￾rophages (BMDMs). When comparing IL-1β secretion acti￾vation by BMDMs from TXNIP- or NLRP3-deficient mice, 
they found a decrease IL-1β in Nlrp3-/-, but not in TXNIP-/-
cells, ruling out a significant role of TXNIP, at least in their 
experimental model (Masters et al., 2010).
Verification of the hypothesis that ROS act as second￾ary mediators responsible for NLRP3 activation requires 
the identification of the source of ROS responsible for 
such role. In a report by Dostert et  al. (2008), stimula￾tion of THP-1 cells with asbestos, MSU, and ATP resulted 
in a ROS-dependent activation of NLRP3 and IL-1β
production, which was inhibited by NOX inhibitors and 
by knock down of its p22phox subunit. The possible role 
of NOX-derived ROS in NLRP3 activation has, however, 
not been uniformly verified. Thus, in a study using mac￾rophages obtained from mice lacking gp91phox (NOX2), 
IL-1β response to multiple NLRP3 agonists was not modi￾fied (Hornung et al., 2008). Furthermore, a study by van 
Bruggen et  al. (2010) reported that primary peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells obtained from patients with 
chronic granulomatous disease, who lack the expression 
of p22phox and thus disclose impaired NOX activity, were 
able to secrete normal amounts of IL-1β.
Recent observations have implicated mitochondria as 
the primary source of ROS ultimately responsible for the 
activation of NLRP3 (Zhou et  al., 2011; Martinon, 2012). 
Many activators of NLRP3 have been shown to disrupt the 
inner mitochondrial membrane potential, possibly as a 
consequence of cellular potassium efflux and resulting 
alterations of mitochondrial matrix volume (Martinon, 
2012). The ensuing mitochondrial dysfunction promotes 
the accelerated generation of ROS from the electron trans￾port chain, leading to the oxidation of mitochondrial DNA 
(mtDNA) and its release into the cytosol (Figure 6), where 
it binds to NLRP3 to trigger its activation, as recently dem￾onstrated by three independent groups (Nakahira et  al., 
2011; Zhou et  al., 2011; Shimada et  al., 2012). Oxidized 
mtDNA is thus emerging as a key ‘secondary’ danger 
molecule linking many forms of cellular stress to inflam￾masome activation (Martinon, 2012). The crucial role of 
mitochondria in this scheme of event has been further 
reinforced by a recent report by Misawa et al. (2013), who 
showed that inducers of NLRP3 promoted the relocaliza￾tion of mitochondria near the ER, allowing the apposition 
of the adaptor protein ASC (on mitochondria) to NLRP3 (on 
the ER) with consecutive assembly of the inflammasome. 
These processes were driven by a series of integrated 
signals involving a decrease of mitochondrial NAD+, fol￾lowed by the accumulation of acetylated microtubules 
with subsequent, dynein-dependent, spatial rearrange￾ment of mitochondria (Misawa et al., 2013).
The latest developments in the molecular biology of 
NLRP3 provide essential information to understand the 
mechanisms governing the initiation and perpetuation of 
inflammation in many pathological conditions. Mitochon￾dria are vulnerable targets of multiple cellular stressors, 
and as such are particularly well positioned to perceive 
and signal the presence of noxious stimuli. These stimuli 
influence normal mitochondrial metabolism, resulting in 
a decrease of cellular NAD+, the production of ROS, and 
the release of oxidized mtDNA. Whereas such mecha￾nisms have long been recognized as the key triggers of cell 

218      J. Lugrin et al.: Oxidative stress and inflammation
death (Yu et al., 2012), they also emerge as fundamental 
players in the activation of inflammatory pathways by 
fostering the activation of NLRP3. Therefore, beyond their 
role in governing cell death processes, mitochondria also 
represent master regulators of innate immune processes 
(Arnoult et al., 2011; Galluzzi et al., 2012), which explains 
the frequent association of mitochondrial damage with 
acute and chronic inflammatory diseases.
At variance with the oxidative stress model of NLRP3 
activation, it must be mentioned that a limited number 
of observations have suggested that ROS could instead 
inhibit the inflammasome, through a mechanism involv￾ing the oxidation and glutathionylation of critical cysteine 
residues (Cys397 and Cys362) within caspase-1 (Meiss￾ner et  al., 2008). These results raise the possibility that 
NLRP3, instead of being purely responsive to oxidative 
stress, might function, at least in some cell types, as a 
sensor of the global redox status of the cell, governed by 
a highly dynamic balance between oxidant production 
and the redox buffering capacities, as well developed by 
Rubartelli in two recent articles (Rubartelli et  al., 2011; 
Rubartelli, 2012).
Oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory 
signaling pathways: the role of NF-κB
As presented in the previous sections, the inflamma￾tory response mounted upon sensing of danger signals 
involves both inflammasome- and TLR-dependent pro￾cesses. Responses triggered by TLRs are conveyed pri￾marily by the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, 
and, to a lesser extent, by MAPKs and other transcrip￾tion factors, AP-1 and IRFs. NF-κB is heavily redox sensi￾tive, and as such has a strategic position at the crossroad 
between oxidative stress and inflammation, which will be 
discussed here.
Molecular biology of NF-κB
NF-κB is a master regulator of inflammation, controlling 
the expression of hundreds of genes implicated in innate 
immune responses, and is also a key transcription factor 
regulating many antiapoptotic genes. It encompasses a 
family of dimeric proteins, which comprise NF-κB1 (p50 
and its precursor p105), NF-κB2 (p52 and its precursor 
p100), p65 (RelA), RelB, and c-Rel. These proteins bear 
a conserved domain of ∼300 amino acids termed the Rel 
homology domain, responsible for dimerization into mul￾tiple homodimers or heterodimers with various abilities 
to activate target genes. The most common dimeric form 
of NF-κB is the heterodimer p50/p65. Of note, only RelA, 
RelB, and c-Rel have potent transcriptional activation 
domains, whereas Rel proteins lacking these domains, 
e.g., p50 homodimers, function as transcriptional repres￾sors (Bonizzi and Karin, 2004; Napetschnig and Wu, 
2013). Under resting conditions, NF-κB is held inactive in 
the cytoplasm through binding to an inhibitory protein 
named IκB (IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBε), which masks the 
nuclear localization sequence of NF-κB subunits (Senftle￾ben and Karin, 2002). Additional IκBs (IκBξ, Bcl-3, and 
IκBNS) are found in the nucleus, where they bind spe￾cifically to p50 homodimers and modulate their activity 
(Napetschnig and Wu, 2013).
The activation of NF-κB proceeds through two dis￾tinct pathways, termed the canonical and non-canonical 
pathways. The ‘canonical’ (or classic) pathway, which is 
responsible for activation of innate immune and antiapo￾ptotic responses, relies on the induced phosphorylation 
of IκB at two conserved serine residues (S32 and S36 in 
IκBα), followed by its polyubiquitination and degrada￾tion by the 26S proteasome (Figure 7). IκB degradation 
unmasks the nuclear localization sequence of NF-κB, 
which can then freely translocate to the nucleus and 
activate target genes. Phosphorylation of IκB is second￾ary to the activation of a protein kinase complex, IKK, 
composed of a heterodimer of two catalytic subunits, 
IKKα and IKKβ, associated with a dimer of a regulatory 
subunit, IKKγ, in response to the engagement of TLRs 
and the IL-1 receptor. The ‘non-canonical’ (or alternative) 
pathway, which is essential for the maturation of B cells 
and secondary lymphoid organ development, is specifi￾cally dependent on IKKα. The latter is activated by an 
upstream kinase termed NIK (NF-κB inducing kinase), 
consecutively to the engagement of various members 
of the TNF receptor family. In turn, activated IKKα pro￾motes the phosphorylation of p100 and its processing 
into mature p52, resulting in its translocation to the 
nucleus and the induction of p52-dependent target genes 
(see Karin et al., 2004; Vallabhapurapu and Karin, 2009; 
DiDonato et al., 2012 for extensive reviews). The last level 
of NF-κB regulation occurs in the nucleus, and includes 
chromatin remodeling and p65 serine phosphorylation. 
Chromatin remodeling, regulated by acetylation-dea￾cetylation processes of lysine residues within histones 
by histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases, 
is required to allow DNA uncoiling and accessibility of 
NF-κB. Phosphorylation of p65 represents a final step 
essential for full transcriptional activity of NF-κB, the 
most important being Ser276 phosphorylation mediated 
by protein kinase A (Gloire and Piette, 2009).

Modulation of NF-κB by oxidative stress
The first evidence of the redox sensitivity of NF-κB was 
presented by Schreck et al. (1991), who showed that H2
O2
potently and rapidly activated NF-κB in a human T-cell 
line, whereas it was inhibited by antioxidants such as 
N-acetylcysteine and other thiol compounds. This concept 
was further extended by a series of experimental studies 
reporting on the direct activation of NF-κB by various 
oxidants and its inhibition by chemical antioxidants or 
by the upregulation of endogenous antioxidant defenses 
(reviewed in Li and Karin, 1999). It was then proposed that 
ROS might represent key secondary mediators responsible 
for the activation of NF-κB in response to multiple stimuli, 
including LPS and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Gloire 
et al., 2006). This notion was, however, soon debated, as 
it became evident that NF-κB activation by exogenous ROS 
was highly cell specific (Li and Karin, 1999), and that, in 
multiple cell lines, endogenously produced ROS did not 
mediate such activation (Hayakawa et al., 2003). The con￾troversy gained further momentum with the publication 
of several reports showing that, in some cell types, ROS 
triggered an inhibition, instead of an activation, of this 
transcription factor (Zahler et al., 2000; Korn et al., 2001; 
Torrie et al., 2001). Therefore, the role of ROS in the regu￾lation of NF-κB has evolved over the years from inducer 
to modulator, as presented in detail in a recent review by 
Oliveira-Marques et al. (2009).
Redox regulation occurs at multiple levels of the NF-κB 
pathway, both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus (Gloire 
and Piette, 2009). In cells disclosing NF-κB activation 
in response to ROS, two distinct triggering mechanisms 
have been identified in the cytoplasm (Figure 7). The first 
one includes the classic pathway of IκB serine phospho￾rylation and degradation in response to IKK activation. 
In this scenario, oxidants induce the upstream activa￾tion of protein kinase D, both through tyrosine phospho￾rylation (at Tyr463) by the tyrosine kinase Abl, and serine

Upon TLR engagement, the IKK complex becomes phosphorylated and activated. Activated IKK in turn phosphorylates the inhibitor IκB 
on serine 32 and 36, targeting IκB to proteasomal degradation. Free NF-κB dimers (mainly p50/p65 heterodimers) can then freely translo￾cate to the nucleus and activate target genes. ROS promote NF-κB activation at three distinct levels: (1) ROS enhance IKK phosphorylation 
by activating protein kinase D (PKD) or by inhibiting PP2A, the phosphatase responsible for IKK dephosphorylation. (2) ROS trigger the 
phosphorylation of tyrosine 42 within IκB, resulting either in its dissociation from the NF-κB dimer or its degradation by calpain-mediated 
digestion. (3) ROS can initiate various intranuclear changes inducing chromatin remodeling, which foster DNA binding of the NF-κB dimer.

phosphorylation (at Ser738/Ser742) by protein kinase Cδ. 
In turn, PKD activates IKKβ, resulting in IκB degradation 
and transcriptional activation of NF-κB (Storz and Toker, 
2003; Storz et  al., 2004). Besides this PKD-dependent 
activation of IKK, a mechanism of IKK phosphorylation 
related to oxidant-dependent inhibition of phosphatases 
(especially PP2A) has also been postulated (Li et al., 2006; 
Witt et al., 2009; Loukili et al., 2010).
The second one involves an atypical mechanism 
implicating tyrosine phosphorylation (Tyr42) on IκB 
(Figure 7), instead of the classic, IKK-dependent, IκB 
serine phosphorylation (Schoonbroodt et al., 2000). The 
mechanism may implicate here various kinases, includ￾ing the tyrosine kinases Syk (Takada et  al., 2003), p56 
LCK and ZAP-70 (Livolsi et  al., 2001), as well as casein 
kinase II (Romieu-Mourez et  al., 2001). In response to 
Tyr42 phosphorylation, IκB can either be degraded, by 
a mechanism independent from the proteasome but 
dependent on calpain-mediated digestion (Schoon￾broodt et al., 2000), or it simply dissociates from NF-κB 
without degradation in a process implicating the kinases 
PI3K and c-Src (Beraud et  al., 1999; Fan et  al., 2003). 
In either case, the release of NF-κB from its inhibitor 
allows it to translocate to the nucleus and activate target 
genes (Gloire et al., 2006; Oliveira-Marques et al., 2009). 
Besides these cytoplasmic mechanisms, several redox￾based processes occurring in the nucleus have also 
been reported to promote NF-κB activation by favoring 
chromatin remodeling, such as the reduction of histone 
deacetylase activity, as well as the induction of lysine 
acetylation and serine phosphorylation of histone H3 
(Yang et al., 2006, 2008b).
At variance with the above-described ROS-depend￾ent NF-κB activation, evidence exists that, in multiple 
conditions, ROS serve instead as potent inhibitors of 
NF-κB (Figure 8). Three main underlying mechanisms 
have been postulated. The first one involves the ROS￾dependent prevention of IKK phosphorylation, related to 
various redox-based modifications of a critical cysteine 
residue (Cys179) in IKKβ (extensively reviewed in 
Pantano et al., 2006). The second mechanism involves a 
direct inhibition of the proteasome by oxidants, resulting

Figure 8 Negative regulation of NF-κB by oxidative stress.
Oxidative stress can downregulate NF-κB signaling by acting at four distinct levels: (1) ROS oxidize cysteine 179 within IKKβ, preventing 
its phosphorylation and activation. (2) ROS inhibit the 26S proteasome, thereby preventing IκB degradation and release of free NF-κB. (3) 
Cytoplasmic ROS oxidize cysteine 62 within the p50 subunit of NF-κB. Oxidized p50 cannot bind to DNA. Binding is restored following reduc￾tion of oxidized p50 within the nucleus by the concerted actions of three antioxidant enzymes, thioredoxin (TRX), peroxiredoxin (PRX), and 
the DNA repair enzyme APE1/Ref1. 4. RNS can modify p65 by S-nitrosylation of cysteine 38, or by nitration of tyrosine 66 and tyrosine 155, 
preventing p65-DNA binding and favoring p65 nuclear export.

in the prevention of IκB degradation, as notably demon￾strated in airway epithelial cells (Jaspers et  al., 2001) 
and polymorphonuclear cells (Zmijewski et  al., 2007). 
The third mechanism involves direct redox modifica￾tions of NF-κB subunits affecting either the p50 or the 
p65 subunit. The p50 subunit possesses a highly redox 
active cysteine within its Rel homology domain (Cys62), 
which is oxidized within the cytoplasm in conditions of 
oxidative stress. Upon translocation to the nucleus, oxi￾dized Cys62 impairs DNA binding, thereby preventing 
NF-κB to activate target genes (Kabe et  al., 2005). DNA 
binding is restored through the reduction of Cys62 within 
the nucleus, following the concerted activity of several 
antioxidant enzymes, including thioredoxin (Hirota 
et al., 1999), peroxiredoxin-1 (Hansen et al., 2007), and 
the DNA repair enzyme APE1/Ref-1 (Nishi et  al., 2002). 
The compartmentalization of Cys62 oxidation/reduc￾tion illustrates the important aspect of spatial specificity 
in the process of NF-κB redox regulation, as brilliantly 
reviewed by Gloire and Piette (2009) in a recent article. 
A further redox modification of Cys62 in p50 is NO-medi￾ated S-nitrosylation, which prevents DNA binding of 
NF-κB (Sha and Marshall, 2012). Besides p50, p65 may 
also be affected by two distinct redox modifications, the 
first one being S-nitrosylation of Cys38 (Sha and Marshall, 
2012) and the second one being nitration of two tyro￾sine residues (Tyr66/Tyr152) by peroxynitrite (Park et al., 
2005). Both modifications inhibit NF-κB transcriptional 
activity, by inducing its unbinding from DNA and its 
nuclear export (Gloire and Piette, 2009).
In summary, ROS and RNS definitely play a central 
role in the regulation of NF-κB, although this role remains 
incompletely understood, in view of the contrasted 
outcome (activation vs. inhibition) reported. The underly￾ing reasons remain thus far unclear, but it is likely that 
the particular experimental conditions explain, at least 
partly, these contrasted results: these include notably 
the specific cell type studied, the particular ROS or RNS 
studied, the concentration of the oxidants used, as well as 
the concomitant stimulation of cells with NF-κB activators 
such as cytokines or LPS together with oxidants (Gloire 
and Piette, 2009; Oliveira-Marques et  al., 2009; Loukili 
et al., 2010). It is also probable that the redox regulation 
of NF-κB may dynamically evolve over time and that dis￾tinct mechanisms are set in motion at different stages of 
the inflammatory response. One possibility might be that 
ROS could promote NF-κB responses in the early phases 
of the process, while they would instead inhibit these 
responses at later stages, thereby favoring the induc￾tion of tissue repair. In support of such hypothesis, it has 
been proposed that the modifications introduced by NO 
and peroxynitrite on p50 and p65 (as described above) 
could represent important negative feedback mechanisms 
downregulating inflammation under conditions of ele￾vated NO production mediated by the inducible isoform of 
NO synthase (Gloire and Piette, 2009).
The NF-κB signaling pathway has been by far the most 
widely studied in terms of redox regulation. It is, however, 
worth to mention here that additional signal transduc￾tion cascades linked with inflammation also disclose 
redox-sensitive characteristics. These include primarily 
proteins from the MAPK family (ERK, JNK, and p38) and 
the transcription factor AP-1, which have been the matter 
of several recent reviews to which we refer the interested 
reader for further information (McCubrey et  al., 2006; 
Liaudet et al., 2009; Brigelius-Flohe and Flohe, 2011; Ray 
et al., 2012).
Conclusions, future perspectives
Since its early clinical description by Celsus about 
2000  years ago (rubor, tumor, calor, et dolor: redness, 
swelling, heat, and pain), inflammation had been essen￾tially considered an internal response to an external 
stressor, primarily infection and injury. Recent discoveries 
in the field of innate immune response have dramatically 
changed such vision, and inflammation is now recognized 
as an adaptive response to any form of danger arising both 
from the outside and from the inside. At various degrees, 
inflammation is therefore present in virtually every acute 
or chronic human malady, and a precise understanding of 
its pathophysiological mechanisms might, de facto, help 
devise novel therapeutics for these diseases. Of particular 
relevance, these same conditions are also typically associ￾ated with significant alterations of redox balance, related 
to the upregulated production of multiple oxygen- and 
nitrogen-centered reactive chemical species, promoting 
the development of oxidative stress. Evidence accumu￾lated over the past two decades has pointed to significant 
connections between inflammation and oxidative stress, 
both processes contributing to fuel the other one, thereby 
establishing a vicious cycle able to perpetuate and propa￾gate the inflammatory response. Still, only the tip of the 
iceberg regarding this complex crosstalk has been thus far 
illuminated, and many questions remain unanswered. For 
instance, the precise sources and the particular form of 
redox species involved in a given situation, the spatial and 
temporal resolution relevant to specific molecular interac￾tions, the influence of the peculiar chemical environment 
on redox-based biological reactions, or the role of oxidants 

222      J. Lugrin et al.: Oxidative stress and inflammation
pertaining to anti-inflammatory processes represent a few 
issues that deserve further in-depth exploration. Unravel￾ing these various aspects of the inflammatory-oxidative 
connection will undoubtedly foster the development of 
efficient strategies to treat a wide range of debilitating 
human illnesses.

Jérôme Lugrin studied biology at Lausanne University and obtained 
his MSc in 2006. He then obtained his PhD degree in 2011 at the 
Service of Infectious Diseases, Lausanne University Hospital. The 
topic of his thesis was the modulation of innate immune responses 
in sepsis by epigenetic drugs, especially histone deacetylase inhibi￾tors. Since 2011 he works in the laboratory of Prof. Lucas Liaudet at 
the Department of Intensive Care Medicine of Lausanne University 
Hospital, where he focuses on post-myocardial infarction inflamma￾tory processes.
Nathalie Rosenblatt-Velin obtained her PhD degree in Immunology 
at the University Louis Pasteur in Strasbourg, France. In 2002, she 
joined the laboratory of Prof. Thierry Pedrazzini at the University 
of Lausanne, Switzerland, where she specialized in the field of 
cardiac stem cells. In 2005, she was awarded the prestigious Pfizer 
price in cardiovascular research for her works on the differentiation 
of cardiac progenitor cells. In 2008, she joined the laboratory of 
pathophysiology of Prof. Bernard Waeber, at Lausanne University, 
to further develop her research in the field of endothelial progenitor 
cells and cardiac stem cells. Since 2008, she also works in close 
collaboration with the laboratory of Prof. Lucas Liaudet.
Roumen Parapanov studied the Veterinary medicine at the Uni￾versity of Thrace, Stara Zagora, Bulgaria, obtaining his Master 
degree in 1996. In 2002 he obtained a MSc degree in biology at the 
University of Geneva, Switzerland, working on the role of Bcl2 in 
the immune response during the BCG infection. He then obtained 
a PhD degree in 2007, working on the strategies of reproduction of 
small mammals, at the Department of Ecology and Evolution of the 
University of Lausanne. In 2011, he joined the laboratory of Prof. 
Lucas Liaudet at the Department of Intensive Care Medicine in Laus￾anne, to focus on the role of innate immune signaling in myocardial 
infarction. 
Lucas Liaudet obtained his MD degree in 1989 from the University of 
Lausanne, Switzerland. He obtained a board certification in internal 
medicine in 1998 and in intensive care medicine in 2000, and is 
now associate professor and attending physician in the Department 
of Intensive Care Medicine and Burn Center at Lausanne University 
Hospital. After a research fellowship in the laboratory of experi￾mental pathophysiology at Lausanne University from 1994 to 1996, 
where his main focus was the role of nitric oxide in sepsis, he joined 
the laboratory led by Prof. Csaba Szabo and Prof. Andrew Salzman 
in Beverly, MA, from 1999–2001, where he worked in the field of oxi￾dative and nitrosative stress-mediated tissue injury. Since 2001, he 
leads his own laboratory at Lausanne University, primarily focusing 
on the mechanisms of redox -dependent modulation of inflamma￾tory signalling in the ischemic heart.
