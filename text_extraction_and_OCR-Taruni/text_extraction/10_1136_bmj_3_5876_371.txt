Summary
Cytological and virological studies on 74 patients with
functioing renal allografts were undertaken to detect
polyomavirus infection of the renal tract. Ten patients
(13 5%) were excreting polyomavirus. Virus particles
were seen in the electron microscope in urine samples
from eight patients. B.K. polyomavirus was isolated
from four patients. Infection with a different polyoma￾virus was probable in one patient. Virus isolation was
most readily achieved when large numbers of intact
virus particles were seen in the urine. Patients who were
excreting large amounts of polyomavirus shed numerous
inclusion-bearing cells which could be detected by
cytology. A serological study showed that the prevalence
of B.K. antibody was similar to that found in the general
population and 38% of this series of transplant patients
had evidence of active infection with B.K. virus.
Introduction
Viruses morphologically resembling members of the polyoma￾virus group have been recovered recently from man. The first of
these, named B.K. virus, was isolated in tissue culture from the
urine of a renal transplant patient (Gardner et al., 1971). Three
other viruses have been grown in tissue cultures inoculated with
brain material from cases of progressive multifocal leucoen￾cephalopathy, a rare neurological disease (Padgett et al., 1971;
Weiner et al., 1972). One of these, the J.C. virus isolated by
Padgett et al., was shown by immunofluorescence to be un￾related to three members of the papovavirus group, polyoma,

siman virus 40 (S.V.40), and human papillomavirus. The other
two strains, however, isolated by Weiner et al., were reported to
be closely related if not identical with S.V.40, a virus found in
kidney cell cultures of certain species of monkeys. B.K. virus
was found to be unrelated to polyoma and human papillomavirus
but had a minor antigenic relationship with S.V.40.
In the patient from whom B.K. virus was isolated numerous
inclusion-bearing cells were noted in several of his urine samples
and large numbers of polyomavirus particles were shown by
electron microscopy. Serological studies suggested that the
infection resulted from activation of latent virus during immuno￾suppressive therapy. As a result of these observations a cyto￾logical, serological, and virological study of patients with
functioning renal allografts was made for further evidence of
infection with human polyomaviruses, particularly B.K. virus.
The results of these investigations are reported in this paper.
Materials and Methods
STUDY GROUP
The study group consisted of 74 patients from St. Mary's
Hospital, London, with functioning renal allografts; 71 patients
were transplanted with cadaver kidneys and three were given
kidneys from live related donors. Thirteen patients received
two or more grafts and the mean survival time estimated from
the date of the first transplant operation was 35-4 months.
Altogether 45 patients were male and 29 female, and their ages
ranged from 12 to 43 years (mean 27-3 years). All were receiving
azathioprine 3 mg/kg body weight and prednisolone 15 mg daily.
In addition 15 patients received cyclophosphamide 50 mg daily
for varying periods during the course of this investigation, which
continued for two years. Each patient was identified by a
number at the time of transplantation. The same numbers have
been used in previous publications (Pletka et al., 1969; Hulme et
al., 1972).
CYTOLOGY AND ELECTRON MICROSCOPY
The techniques for the collection and preparation of urine
samples for cytodiagnosis and for examination in the electron
microscope were described in earlier communications (Gardner

et al., 1971; Coleman et al., 1973). A slight modification of this
procedure for electron microscopy was the occasional use of
whole urine samples instead of clarified urine and 3%
phosphotungstic acid (pH 6 0) instead of silicotungstic acid.
ISOLATION OF B.K. VIRUS
Urine samples were centrifuged at 1,000 r.p.m. for 10 minutes
and 0-2 ml of the deposit and supernatant was inoculated
separately into Vero and human embryo lung fibroblast (H.E.L.)
cell cultures and incubated stationary at 37 °C.
The Vero cultures were maintained by weekly fluid changes
and when possible were incubated for at least three months. At
weekly intervals the monolayers were examined microscopically
for the characteristic cytopathic changes produced by B.K.
virus. These changes were described in a previous paper
(Gardner et al., 1971). At intervals during the period of incuba￾tion and before the cultures were discarded the culture fluids
were examined for the presence of haemagglutinin using 0-5%
human 0 cells.
The H.E.L. cell cultures were primarily used for the isolation
of cytomegalovirus and were incubated for 28 days and main￾tained by twice-weekly fluid changes.
SEROLOGY
A total of 288 serum samples from 73 of the renal allograft
recipients studied were available for testing for antibody to B.K.
virus. The sera were obtained from the hepatitis serum bank of
the Virus Reference Laboratory, Colindale, and from the tissue
typing laboratory at St. Mary's Hospital. Several sera covering a
long period were obtained from most patients.
The renal allograft recipients were placed in two groups.
Group 1 consisted of 40 patients from whom the first serum was
taken before the renal transplant operation. Further sera taken
at least three months after operation were available from 36
patients. Group 2 contained 33 patients from whom the first
serum was taken after the renal transplant operation. In some
cases sera were collected only after an interval of several years.
More than one serum was tested from each person in this group.
Initially the sera were examined for B.K. antibody using the
techniques of complement fixation and haemagglutination
inhibition. Though the results of preliminary studies showed a
good correlation between the two methods used the complement
fixation test was found to be less sensitive. The serological
investigation was therefore continued using the haemagglutina￾tion inhibition technique only; details of the method used have
been described in a previous paper (Gardner, 1973).
Results
CYTOLOGY AND ELECTRON MICROSCOPY
Millipore preparations of 255 urine samples from 74 patients
were examined by light microscopy at low magnification ( x 100)
for the presence of epithelial cells with large basophilic intra￾nuclear inclusions. The inclusion-bearing cells were readily
recognized at low magnifications by virtue of their large size and
intense staining properties. The dense basophilic homogeneous
inclusion body filled the nucleus, which was enlarged and
occupied more than two-thirds of the cell. The nuclear mem￾brane was clearly thickened by a heavy deposition of chromatin
on the inner surface (fig. 1). The diameter of the inclusion￾bearing cells ranged from 35 to 45 iAm and they contrasted
sharply with the normal transitional epithelial cells, which
had an average diameter of 15 to 20 gm. The cytological pattern
of infection with human polyomavirus is consistent with the
histopathological appearance of the renal tract. This is
characterized by pronounced proliferation of the transitional

epithelium with large basophilic inclusions in the surface
epitheial cells (Coleman et al., 1973).
The large intranuclear inclusion-bearing cells seen in
polyomavirus infection differed from the virus-infected cells
described in cytomegalic inclusion disease in several respects.
The nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio is unaltered in cytomegalovirus￾infected cells and the cytoplasm is more abundant and may
contain numerous small basophilic inclusions. The "bird's eye"
appearance typical of nuclei infected with cytomegalovirus and
due to a clear halo around the inclusion was not seen in the
exfoliated polyomavirus-infected cells in our preparations.
The cytological results are shown in table I. Considerable
variation in the number of cells with inclusions was found in
different samples. Altogether 30% of the patients were excreting
such cells.

Altogether 112 urine samples from 50 patients were examined

20 minutes. Samples from eight patients (16%) were found to
contain polyomavirus particles on one or more occasions. No
virus particles were seen in the remaining 97 samples from 42
patients.
The number of virus particles observed was usually small,
with the notable exception of two urine samples from one
patient (case 108) in which they were abundant. Virus particles
were frequently coated with filamentous structures resembling
antibody molecules (fig. 2). In four separate urine samples from
one patient (case 124) the particles, *hile recognizably
polyomavirus, were nearly all disrupted (fig. 3). The findings on
the eight positive individuals are detailed in table II.

samples from all five persons. Electron microscopical studies
were also carried out on 14 urine samples with scanty inclusions
from 13 patients. No polyomavirus particles were seen.
No herpesvirus (cytomegalovirus) particles were seen in any
urine sample by electron microscopy.
VIRUS ISOLATION
A total of 118 urine samples from 57 patients were examined in
Vero cell cultures. Cultures inoculated with 92 of the samples
(78%) were incubated for a period of three to eight months.
The remaining 26 were incubated for two months only. A virus
antigenically identical with B.K. virus and having similar
biological properties was isolated from five urine samples from
four patients (7%).
The correlation between electron microscopy and cytology
results on these five samples and the period of incubation
necessary in Vero cells before cytopathic changes and
haemagglutinin production occurred is shown in table III. Large
numbers of polyoma-like virus particles were seen by electron
microscopy in two urine samples from case 108. B.K. vinrs was
isolated from both samples after an incubation period of two and
three months respectively. The second urine sample was collected
11 days after the first. The first sample from this patient was
also inoculated into a different line of Vero cells, which were
later shown to be less sensitive, since B.K. virus was isolated in
them only after an incubation period of four months.

B.K. virus was also isolated from case 108 by direct inoculation
of the second urine in H.E.L. cell cultures. After an incubation
period of about three months a granular degeneration of
the fibroblast cells was seen, which on passage was quite
distinctive.
Cytomegalovirus was isolated from 35 (61 %) of the 57
patients investigated.
INCIDENCE OF ANTIBODY TO B.K. VIRUS
The number of patients with B.K. antibody in the first serum is
shown in table IV. The incidence was similar in the two groups
but the proportion with high titres was much greater in group 2.

B.K. ANTIBODY RESPONSE TO IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE THERAPY
B.K. antibody response was studied in 69 patients while they
were receiving immunosuppressive drugs. The results are
shown in table V. Active infection with B.K. virus as judged by
changes in antibody titres was clearly evident in 20 of the 36
patients (55-5%) in group 1. Four of these 20 patients had no
detectable antibody in early sera but became positive after
transplantation. Of 16 of the 20 patients who had antibody at the
time of transplantation a significant rise was shown in 13. In
most cases the rise was substantial and permanent. In three
patients a significant fall in titre was shown.

In contrast only 6 (18%) of the 33 patients in group 2 had
significant changes in antibody titres. Four of the six patients
had negative to positive seroconversions and the other two
developed significant increases in titre. Many of the patients in
group 2 had high haemagglutination inhibition antibody titres
in the first sera (table IV). In most cases these serum samples
were collected late after the transplant operation, by which time
the antibody levels were probably permanently high. This may
be the reason why relatively few significant changes in antibody
titres were found in group 2 compared with group 1 (table V).
Eight patients with no detectable B.K. antibody in the first
serum developed haemagglutination inhibition antibody while
receiving immunosuppressive drugs (table VI). Two of these
patients (cases 106 and 123) produced only a minimal antibody
response, which was not maintained. In both cases the antibody
titres later fell to 1 in 20. This is the type of antibody response
which might be expected when a primary infection occurs in an
immunosuppressed patient, but it is also possible that this
change in titre was the result of an anamnestic response in a
patient infected with an antigenically related polyomavirus.
Case 123 was shown by electron microscopy to have polyoma￾virus particles in his urine but B.K. virus was not isolated. Five
of the remaining six patients showed a substantial B.K. antibody
response. It may be in these patients that this was the result not
of a primary infection but of reactivation. Low levels of antibody
not detected by the haemagglutination inhibition test used may
have been present in the first serum.

POLYOMAVIRUS EXCRETION IN 10 PATIENTS
Of the 74 renal transplant patients studied 10 (13.5%) were
found to be excreting polyomavirus by two or more methods of
investigation. One patient (case 108) was positive by all methods.
The results of the investigations are related in table VII. It was
not possible to correlate excretion of the virus with the clinical
condition of the patient. Polyomavirus was excreted over a
period of five months in case 123 and for 13 months in case 124.
Three of the patients who were excreting polyomavirus died
during the period of study. Many inclusion-bearing cells were
seen in histological sections of postmortem material in one
patient only (case 108) who died from septicaemia and from
whom B.K. virus was isolated on two occasions during life.
Intranuclear inclusions were noted in lung, liver, spleen, and
bone marrow and were scattered throughout the renal tract.
Inclusions were particularly numerous in the wall of a sub￾phrenic abscess and in adjacent bowel. Cytomegalovirus but not
B.K. virus was isolated from many organs. Cytomegalovirus was
also isolated from postmortem material from the other two
patients (cases 60 and 160).

Discussion
In this study the methods of exfoliative cytology, electron
microscopy, and virus isolation were applied to the detection of
a new virus infection. Of the 74 renal allograft recipients
investigated over a period of two years 10 (13-5%) were found to
be excreting polyomavirus from the renal tract. In four of these
patients virus was isolated and identified as B.K. virus. In seven
out of eight virus excretors identified by electron microscopy a
significant antibody rise to B.K. virus was shown. In the eighth
patient (case 60), however, no B.K. antibody was detected.
Inclusion-bearing cells were noted in the urine but no virus was
isolated. These findings suggested that infection of the renal
tract with more than one kind of polyomavirus could occur and
the virus seen in this patient may have been one of the other
members of the group.
Though only 13-5% of the transplant patients were identified
as excretors serological studies showed that infection of renal
transplant patients with B.K. virus was probably more frequent.
Twenty-six out of 69 patients (38%) had a significant change in
B.K. antibody titre, which suggested an active infection with
this virus. An antibody survey of the general population
(Gardner, 1973) has shown that primary infection with B.K.
virus occurs mainly in childhood and antibody is common in the
adult population. The transplant patients did not differ from
the normal population in the incidence of antibody. Since more
than 70% of the patients studied had B.K. antibody before
receiving a kidney it seems likely that reactivation of latent virus
during immunosuppressive therapy was responsible for the
change in antibody titres. Nevertheless, reinfection with B.K.
or another antigenically related human polyomavirus cannot be
excluded.
A recent report from South Africa (Lecatsas et al., 1973)
described polyomavirus particles in the urine of 8 (44%) out of
18 renal allograft recipients. This incidence is higher than in our
series, where using smaller volumes of urine and fewer speci￾mens per patient polyomavirus was seen in only 8 (16%) out of
50 patients.
The situation in which polyomavirus was seen in the urine
yet not isolated in tissue culture may be explained in several
ways. Sometimes the urine was not cultured for the length of
time necessary to grow B.K. virus (cases 123 and 160). The line
of Vero cells occasionally used was subsequently found to be
comparatively insensitive for B.K. virus isolation. Often the
virus particles in the urine were coated with an antibody-like
substance which may have neutralized the infectivity of the
virus. It is also possible that the particles seen were a different
polyomavirus which could not grow under the culture conditions
used. A further reason why visible virus might not grow in cell
culture is exemplified by case 124. The particles seen in the
urine samples were mostly broken open and appeared incom￾plete. A significant rise in B.K. antibody by complement
fixation and haemagglutination inhibition was shown in this
patient but despite several attempts to isolate B.K. virus from
these urine samples no virus was grown even after a seven￾month incubation period, probably because of the defective
nature of the particles.

From a practical point of view cytology is a convenient screen￾ing method for detecting possible polyomavirus excretors.
Electron microscopy is more sensitive but less practical for
large surveys. Virus isolation presents the difficulty of maintain￾ing large numbers of cultures for long periods of incubation.
Cytology can detect strongly positive excretors such as case 108,
and it is from such patients that virus is most readily isolated.
In large surveys it may be appropriate to use cytology as a
preliminary screening procedure with electron microscopy and
virus isolation for confirmation of virus excretion.
The only human disease with which polyomaviruses have so
far been associated is the rare neurological disorder progressive
multifocal leucoencephalopathy (P.M.L.). Patients with this
disease are often found to have immunological defects, and a
single occurrence of P.M.L. has been described in a patient
17 months after renal transplantation (Manz et al., 1971). No
case of P.M.L. occurred in our series of patients. They will
continue under observation because of the possibility of P.M.L.
developing and because of the oncogenic potential of this group
of viruses.
We are grateful to Professor W. S. Peart and Dr. B. Hulme for
permission to investigate this group of patients, and to Mr. A. A.
Porter for help with the electron microscopy.

Vasopressin Analogue DDAVP in Diabetes Insipidus:
Clinical and Laboratory Studies

Summary
In seven patients with cranial diabetes insipidus an
analogue of vasopressin, DDAVP, produced an anti￾diuresis lasting up to 20 hours after a single intranasal
dose. Lysine vasopressin (LVP) in the same dose produced
a less potent antidiuresis which lasted for only three to
four hours. The plasma half life of DDAVP was 7 8 and
75 5 min for the fast and slow phases, compared with
2 5 and 14 5 min for LVP. Radioiodine-labelied DDAVP
was not destroyed by incubation with late pregnancy
plasma, which contains an enzyme that inactivates
vasopressin. The slow metabolic clearance of DDAVP,
its absorption through the nasal mucosa, and its lack of
side effects make this the ideal drug for the treatment of
vasopressin-sensitive diabetes insipidus. Patients usually
require 10 to 20 pg DDAVP given intranasally twice daily
for good clinical control of their diabetes insipidus.
Introduction
Though many different forms of therapy have been used in the
treatment of diabetes insipidus (D.I.), until recently injections
of Pitressin Tannate (vasopressin tannate) in oil have been
the only satisfactory method for the treatment of severe cases.
Pitressin, however, is an impure preparation which includes
several peptides other than vasopressin, including oxytocin,

neurophysin (Martin, 1971), prolactin, and a corticotrophin-like
peptide (Scott et al., 1972). Martin (1971) showed that patients
treated with Pitressin may produce high titres of antibodies
against neurophysin. Furthermore, patients often find the
injections difficult to administer and unpleasant to receive.
A number of drugs unrelated to vasopressin have been found
to be useful in the management of diabetes insipidus, including
diuretics (Crawford and Kennedy, 1959), chlorpropamide
(Arduino et al., 1966), carbamazepine (Braunhofer and Zicha,
1966), and clofibrate (De Gennes et al., 1970). The mechanism
of their action is not well understood, but chlorpropamide
appears to act by increasing renal responsiveness to endogenous
vasopressin (Berndt et al., 1970; Miller and Moses, 1970). Side
effects such as hypokalaemia with diuretics and hypoglycaemia
with chlorpropamide have limited their use, especially in
children. Furthermore, for effective chlorpropamide therapy
some functioning posterior pituitary must remain, and in many
patients the "Antabuse"-like actions of chlorpropamide are
unacceptable.

compared with other commercially available preparations of
vasopressin. Its synthesis and chemical properties were described
by Zaoral et al. (1967) and a study of its pharmacological
properties with a preliminary report of its clinical application by
Vavra et al. (1968). It has been suggested that the prolonged
