Malignant melanoma is considered to be a heterogeneous disease that arises from altered genes and 
transformed melanocytes. In this study, special softjet cold atmospheric plasma was used to treat 
three different human melanoma cells using air and N2 gases to check the anti-melanoma activity. 
The physical effects by plasma revealed an increase in the temperature with the gradual reduction in 
pH at 60sec, 180sec and 300sec air and N2 plasma treatment. Cellular toxicity revealed a decreased 
in cell survival (~50% cell survival using air gas and <~60% cell survival using N2 gas at 60sec plasma 
treatment in G-361 cells). Gene analysis by q-PCR revealed that 3min and 5min air and N2 plasma 
treatment activated apoptotic pathways by triggering apoptotic genes in all three melanoma cell 
lines. The apoptosis was confirmed by DAPI staining and its related pathways were further explored 
according to protein-protein docking, and their probable activation mechanism was revealed. 
The pathways highlighted that activation of apoptosis which leads to cellular cascades and hence 
stimulation ASK1 (docking method) revealed that softjet plasma can be an effective modality for human 
melanoma treatment.
Malignant melanoma considered as one type of cancer that primarily originates by a mutation in skin pigment 
making cells known as melanocytes1–5
. Melanoma has the highest mortality rate worldwide and remains one 
of the most prominent types of skin cancer6
. It is considered to be a heterogeneous disease with complex cel￾lular mechanisms owing to specific genetic alterations that occur within several functionally related molecu￾lar pathways7
. Methods for controlling cancer mostly depend on anticancer agents, which are limited and have 
after-effects. Thus, there must be an urgent need to adopt new technology for melanoma treatment. Soft jet cold 
atmospheric plasma (CAP) is a recent technological innovation that has opened a new research perspective to the 
melanoma treatment and other medical applications8
, such as treating skin diseases9–11, dental problems12,13, and 
wounds14. The softjet plasma device uses high voltage and current to discharge plasma by using different gas or 
gaseous mixtures. The discharged CAP contains ionized gas molecules, electrons, excited atoms, ultraviolet (UV) 
radiations, electromagnetic fields, etc. The softjet plasma device induced reactive atoms to combine with each 
other and other molecules to form reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS)15–17. These characteristics of soft 
jet cold atmospheric plasma have encouraged its therapeutic application for melanoma treatment.
Here, we examined the effect of soft jet CAP using air and N2 gases on normal human dermal fibroblast 
(nHDF) and different human melanoma cell lines: G-361, SK-MEL-31, and WM-266-4. CAP is nowadays pro￾posed to be used in cancer treatment, but very few studies and evidence on the effect of softjet CAP on melanoma 
are available so far. The heating effect and increase in pH are the most common issues with traditional cold 
plasma technology and can be controlled with a softjet device.

The focus of this study was to estimate the anti-melanoma activity of softjet CAP by using air and N2 gases and 
an evaluation of the plausible mechanism to targeted melanoma treatment. We hypothesize that plasma exposure 
from different gases individually induces cancer cell death with minimal effects on normal adjacent cells. The 
results demonstrated the downregulation of metabolic viability with the simultaneous upregulation of apoptosis 
and its related genes. This new approach toward abrogating the apoptotic pathway using softjet CAP may provide 
a different strategy for melanoma treatment. We further explored the role of selected reactive oxygen and nitrogen 
species in modulating the apoptotic pathway through a protein-protein docking simulation. The in vitro results 
showed that soft jet CAP from the air and N2 gas can plausibly be used to inhibit melanoma progression.

Device characterization. Electrical characteristics. The device used for the experimentation and its dia￾grammatic illustration was mentioned (Fig. 1a,b). The electrical characteristics (recorded with Lecroy wavesurfer 
434, 350MHZ oscilloscope using Tektronix P6015A high voltage probe and Tektronix P6022 current probe) for 
the soft plasma jet operated with air and nitrogen gas are shown in Fig. 1d,e. The flow rate of both gases was fixed 
at 1.5 liters per minute. Plasma was generated in dimming mode by using a DC to AC inverter whose operational 
time (Ton) and shutting time (Toff) were 13.71ms and 114.80ms (Fig. 1c). The duty percentage was ~11%. A long 
shutting of time (~90% of the total duty cycle) was essential in order to prevent heating of the plasma jet and ena￾ble longer operational duration. The current and voltage waveforms recorded during the Ton period of the circuit 
are shown in Fig. 1d,e for air and nitrogen gas respectively. For both air and nitrogen gas, the voltage waveforms 
appear distorted during each positive and negative half cycle of the applied voltage. The frequency of the source 
is ~70 kHz. The dissipated power (P) during the discharge was estimated by integrating the voltage (V(t)) and 
current (I(t)) signals recorded at each time points (t) over one time period (T) of the duty cycle as Kim et al. 2019,

A comparison among the averaged values of applied voltage, total current, frequency and dissipated energy 
for the soft plasma jet operated with air and nitrogen gas are shown in Table 1. It can be seen that the values of 
breakdown voltage, total current and dissipated energy for the plasma jet operated with nitrogen gas are lower 
than that of (same) plasma jet operated with air gas.
Optical characteristics. The optical emission spectra (OES) of the discharge calibrated in the units of absolute 
irradiance (µW/cm2
/nm) recorded with HR4000 spectrometer (Ocean Optics Corporation) for plasma jet oper￾ated with air gas is shown in Fig. 1f. Emissions from various types of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species are 
clearly observed in the range of 200–900nm. Between 200–300nm, there are emissions from nitric oxide gamma 
(γ) band at various wavelengths of 236nm, 246nm, and 258nm. These species are originated through the inter￾action of electrons as well as metastable atoms with oxygen and nitrogen molecules which are present in the air 
gas18,19. An emission from hydroxyl radical (OH•
) of a very short lifetime is observed from 306–309nm due to 
the interaction of energetic electrons/metastable atoms with water molecules present in the feeding gas as well 
as the ambient environment. OH•
 radicals are strong precursors for the formation of long-lived reactive species 
like hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)20. There are also strong emissions from nitrogen second positive system (N2 SPS) 
from 315–380 nm and from nitrogen first negative system (N2 FNS) from 390–440 nm18,19,21. Excited nitrogen 
molecules not only combine with ambient oxygen molecules to form secondary reactive species but also they are 
able to dissociate water molecules and lead to the formation of OH•
 radicals22. In addition to these species, there 
are also emissions from atomic oxygen (777 nm and 845 nm) and atomic nitrogen (747 nm and 868 nm). The 
emission for plasma jet operated with nitrogen gas is quite similar to that of air gas but the emission from atomic 
oxygen is absent (Fig. 1g).
Temperature and pH estimation. MEM and RPMI cell culture serum-free media were placed in 48 well 
plates (1ml per well) and exposed to air and N2 gas plasma for 30 sec, 60 sec, 180 sec, and 300 sec. After the expo￾sure time, the temperature and pH of the media were measured in triplicate with an infrared (IR) camera (Fluke 
Ti100 Series Thermal Imaging Cameras, UK) and a pH meter (Eutech Instruments, Singapore).
Cell lines for the study. The normal human dermal fibroblast (nHDF) and human melanoma cell lines 
(G-361, SK-MEL-31, and WM-266-4) were used to check the efficacy of air and N2 gas plasmas at different times 
and concentrations. All three melanoma cell lines were maintained in RPMI and MEM and supplemented with

(10–15%) fetal bovine serum, 1% nonessential amino acids, 1% glutamine, 1% penicillin (100 IU/mL) and strep￾tomycin (100mg/mL) (Hyclone, USA) while nHDF cell line was maintain using FGM-2 bulletkit (Lonza, USA). 
All cultures were maintained at 37 °C, 95% relative humidity, and 5% CO2. The cells were grown in 24-well plate 
until confluence for experimentation.
Alamar blue cytotoxicity assay. The cellular toxicity within all four cells was quantified with an Alamar 
Blue assay23, which is based on the enzymatic reduction of an indicator dye (resazurin to resorufin) by viable cells. 
Cells were seeded in 24 well plates for all experiments (80,000 cells/mL for G-361 cells and 50,000 cells/mL for 
nHDF, SK-MEL-31 and WM-266-4 cells). After 24h of seeding, cells were given different doses of plasma from 
each gas. The distance between the nozzle of the jet plasma and upper surface of the cell culture media was kept 
at 1 cm throughout the experiments (Fig. 1b). The cells were incubated for 24h after the plasma treatment. After 
24h, all of the media were drained off and replaced with fresh media containing Alamar Blue (diluted 1:10) and 
kept for 4h until the color changed from blue to pink to indicate cell viability. The absorbance at 570 and 600nm

was measured with a microplate reader (Biotek, Vermont, USA). The cell viabilities were assessed as the ratio 
between the absorbance of the plasma-treated and normal cells24,25.
Measurement of reactive species (H2O2 and NOx) in cell culture media. The levels of peroxide 
(H2O2) and different nitric oxide species (NO2 and NO3) within the cell culture media (RPMI and MEM) were 
evaluated to compare the generation of reactive species after giving plasma treatment (air and N2). The reactive 
species were measured after 30 sec, 60 sec, 180 sec and 300 sec.26 plasma exposure and estimated in micromoles 
per liter (μM) according to the manufacturer’s protocol (BioAssay System, CA, USA). The absorbance was calcu￾lated at 585nm for the H2O2 and 540nm for the nitric oxides (NOx) radicals.
Apoptosis detection in human melanoma cells by DAPI staining and western blotting. All 
the three cells were cultured in their respective media overnight in glass bottom culture dish 35mm2
 (Nest, New 
Jersey, USA) before treatment with softjet plasma using air and N2 feeder gas. The cells were treated with 300 sec 
air CAP and 300 sec N2 CAP and kept it for 24 h in CO2 incubator. After incubation, the cells were fixed with 
3.7% paraformaldehyde and washed 2X with sterile PBS. Afterwards, the cells were permeabilized with 0.5% 
Triton X-100 in PBS for 5min and stained with DAPI (1mg/ml) for 30min at room temperature. The cells were 
again re-washed with PBS to avoid excessive staining and fluorescent images were captured and analysed using 
Olympus IX83-FP confocal microscope (Tokyo, Japan). For western blotting, cells were harvested after treated 
with CAP for 3 min and 5 min with air and N2 and then washed with PBS and lysed with RIPA buffer. Protein 
was quantified and separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Primary antibodies 
for cleaved caspase 3 (anti-rabbit monoclonal, cell signaling Technology Inc., Danvers, MA, USA) and GAPDH 
(anti-mouse monoclonal, Bio-Rad, CA, USA) were incubated with membrane. The membrane was exposed with 
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary IgG antibodies.
Regulation of gene expression analysis using q-PCR in human melanoma cells. Any alteration 
in the cellular level must be associated with changes in gene expression at the mRNA level. To clarify in molec￾ular levels, we identified some genes that responsible for the cellular apoptosis and degradation of cell mem￾branes by the production of plasma generated reactive species. The primers of apoptotic genes (p53, bax, casp8), 
mitogen-activated protein kinase (map38), and different types of NADPH oxidase genes (nox1-5) were designed 
and synthesized. All three melanoma cells were grown in 24 well plates and treated with softjet plasma using 
air and N2 gas separately. After incubation for 24 h, the cells were trypsinized and collected for RNA isolation 
using Trizol (Invitrogen, USA), after which q-PCR was performed with a Biorad 2X SYBR green mix. Reactions 
were carried out in a Biorad thermal cycler (Biorad, Korea), and the results were expressed as the fold change 
calculated with the ΔΔCt method relative to a control sample27. Meanwhile, 18s rRNA was used as an internal 
normalization control. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed according to the forward and reverse primer 
sequences listed in Table 2.
Computational modeling. The role of peroxide (H2O2) and nitrogen (NOx) species in regulating the activ￾ity of the apoptotic pathway was determined by protein-protein docking and interaction analysis of apoptotic 
proteins: the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and thioredoxin 1 (TRX1) proteins. The human ASK1 
protein has 1374 amino acids and consists of three domains: the N-terminal TRX-binding domain (ASK1-TBD),

central regulatory region (ASK1-CRR) containing the TRAF-binding region, and serine/threonine kinase domain 
(ASK1-CD) located approximately in the center of the molecule28,29 (Fig. 2a).
Protein preparation. The three-dimensional structure of ASK1-TBD was still unknown and domain posi￾tioned between residues 46 and 277in the N-terminal part of ASK1 (Fig. 2a). The homology model of ASK1-TBD 
was resolved by Obsil et al.
29,30, whereas reduced TRX31 protein was obtained (PDB ID: 1ERT) in our study. To 
model the TRX (oxidized) caused by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS), an intramolecular disulfide 
bond was created between the Cys32 and Cys35 residues (Fig. 2b). These modeled protein structures were pre￾pared according to the standard protocol: the addition of H-atoms, optimization of the side chain and restrained 
minimization until a root-mean-square (RMS) gradient of 0.3Å is reached32.
Protein-protein interaction. For the protein-protein interaction analysis, the homology model ASK1 was 
used as the receptor and TRX1-reduced and TRX1-oxidised were used as the ligand. Docking was performed 
with the FRODOCK 2.0 program33,34, which identified the interaction-energy minima through a fast and exhaus￾tive rotational docking search combined with translational scanning. The binding energy was approximated with 
four types of potentials: van der Waals, electrostatics, desolvation, and new coarse-grained knowledge-based 
protein docking. The program produced 1000 poses, and the cluster and absolute energy score were calculated.

Results
Estimation of physical parameters (pH and temperature). Previous studies using CAP with various 
jet plasma devices demonstrated that physical parameters within the solutions were changed, such as an increase 
in temperature26. However, softjet CAP device (PBRC, Seoul) was used in the present study was modified to 
overcome the heating effect which was common issues in previously used plasma devices. With air plasma, the 
temperature in cell media (RPMI, 10% and 15% MEM) showed an increase in temperature after 60 sec, 180 sec, 
and 300 sec treatment time (Fig. 3a). However, with N2 plasma, the temperature slightly dropped after 60 sec 
treatment which later marginally increased and reached a maximum of up to 26.4 °Cin RPMI media after 300 sec 
of treatment (Fig. 3b). This mainly attributed because of the softjet device built to minimize the heating effect at 
the treatment time.
The pH is dependent on primary free radicals generated by CAP and secondary free radicals produced by 
interaction with cell media and hence estimated for 30 sec, 60 sec, 180 sec, and 300 sec. Using air plasma, in the 
RPMI media, the measured pH slightly decreased after 30 sec (6.64) which declined further to 180 s (6.55) and 
300 s (6.47) as compared to control (6.7). The MEM media (10% and 15%) showed slightly decreased in pH after 
30 sec, however, 60sec, 180sec, and 300sec showed noticeable pH decreased. MEM 10% decreased pH 7.02, 6.85, 
and 6.7 while, for 15% MEM, the pH also decreased in a time-dependent manner but was higher at 60 sec (7.13), 
180 sec (6.97), and 300 sec (6.79) (Fig. 3c).
However, N2 plasma exhibited a contrasting effect on the three different cell media compared to air plasma. 
Overall, it showed a slightly increased in pH at 30 sec treatment which was remained constant at later treatment 
time (Fig. 3d).
Effect of air and N2 CAP on H2O2 and NOx levels within cell media. With feeder gases, softjet CAP 
can generate a different kind of free radicals, ions, and UV rays that reacts with the liquid cell culture medium 
to form secondary reactive stable species like H2O2, NO2, and NO3, etc. Using air CAP the level of H2O2 within 
both cell media (RPMI and MEM) increased significantly at all treatment times as compared to the control. The 
softjet air CAP for 60 sec induced H2O2 generation (~25 μM) within the RPMI media, which increased at 180 sec 
(40 μM) and 300 sec (42 μM) of treatment. The MEM media showed comparable H2O2 levels at 30 sec and 60 sec 
treatment while it was higher after 300 sec (46 μM) of treatment (Fig. 4a) as compared to RPMI media. With N2
plasma the H2O2 level in the RPMI and MEM media slightly increased at 30 sec and 60 sec treatment. However,

treatment of 30 sec, 60 sec, 180 sec and 300 sec. Student’s t-tests were performed, and the levels of significance 
are indicated as follows: *p<0.05; **p<0.01; and ***p<0.001.

H2O2 level alleviates significantly at 180 sec (12 μM) which reaches a maximum at 300 sec (20 μM) treatment for 
RPMI media. In contrast, the MEM media also exhibit an increase in the H2O2 level at 180 sec (7 μM) and 300 sec 
(14 μM) respectively (Fig. 4b).
The level of NOx (NO2 and NO3) radicals within RPMI cell media, increased after air plasma treatment at 
all-time intervals, but MEM showed a higher NO concentration (152.9 μM) than RPMI (94 μM) after 30 sec and 
60 sec of treatment and reached its maximum at 300 sec (545 μM) (Fig. 4c).
N2 plasma revealed more intense NOx production than the air plasma in both cell culture media. The NOx
concentration increased significantly (p<0.001) in the RPMI media after 30 sec treatment compared to the con￾trol and it revealed 60 sec (197 μM), 180 sec (361 μM), and 300 sec (646 μM) NOx species. However, MEM media 
showed a higher NOx concentration with N2 plasma treatment at 30 sec (188 μM) and 60 sec (298 μM) compared 
to the RPMI media at the same time intervals. Though, NOx concentration increased only slightly at 180 sec (321 
μM) and reached a maximum at 300 sec (545 μM) (Fig. 4d).
Estimation of CAP-induced toxicity. Cellular toxicity induced by softjet air and N2 CAP in three human 
melanoma cell lines (G-361, SK-MEL-31, and WM-266-4) were estimated using Alamar BlueTm cytotoxicity 
assay at 10 sec, 30 sec, 60 sec, 180 sec, and 300 sec. G-361 cells showed proliferation at 10 sec treatment at all-time 
intervals. The cytotoxicity increased at 180 sec of air CAP treatment (70% survival) and remained the same after 
300sec treatment when incubating for 24h. G-361 cells showed higher toxicity when receiving air and N2 CAP for 
180 sec and 300 sec when incubating for 48h and 72h. CAP treatment using air for 60 sec declined survival rate 
(58%), which increased further after 180 sec (18% survival) and 300 sec (7% survival) of treatment (Fig. 5a). N2
CAP also showed similar trend like air CAP. The cytotoxic effect was higher after 60 sec at 72h incubation (45% 
toxicity) and reached a minimum % survival at 300 sec at all time-intervals (Fig. 5b). For SK-MEL-31, softjet air 
CAP didn’t show much cytotoxicity at 10 sec and 30 sec treatment time at 24 h and 48 h. However, SK-MEL-31 
showed much higher cytotoxicity (60%) when incubated for 48h and 72h at 180sec and 300sec. The N2 CAP also 
showed similar effects like air CAP (Fig. 5c) after giving 10sec and 30sec treatments. However, at 60sec treatment 
time, the % survival declined at all three time-intervals. At 180 sec treatment, the cytotoxicity level increased 
significantly (p<0.001) as compared to control and remained constant at 300 sec treatment time (Fig. 5d). Softjet 
air plasma treatment on WM-266-4 initially showed very low toxicity as compared to control and comparable.

Though % survival at 180 sec CAP treatment, cytotoxicity was much higher and it remains the same at 300 sec 
(Fig. 5e) which keeps on decreasing at all CAP doses and at all time-intervals.
For WM-266-4, N2 CAP treatment decrease % survival with 60 sec CAP treatment and continued to decrease 
with longer CAP treatment times up to 300 sec for 48 h and 72 h incubation periods (Fig. 5f). However, nHDF 
cells showed non-significant effects while receiving air and N2 plasma jet at all time-intervals (Fig. S1). The micro￾scopic data by differential interference contrast (DIC) images revealed that air CAP reduces the number of cells 
with higher pace as compared to N2 CAP after receiving CAP for 300 sec (Fig. S2). Based on the data from the 
soft jet plasma using air and N2 for the three melanoma cell lines, we received IC50 of all three cell lines at 180 sec 
(3min) and 300 sec (5min) and hence kept these plasma doses constant for the study.

Apoptosis detection by DAPI staining, western blotting and estimation of apoptotic and oxida￾tive stress-related genes by air and N2 CAP treatment. The result outcome by individual treatment 
of 300 sec Air CAP significantly provoked apoptosis as compared to 300 sec N2 CAP treatment. The induction 
of apoptosis was evident by DAPI staining using 100X magnification (Olympus IX83-FP confocal microscope, 
Tokyo, Japan) from the initial changes in the structure of nucleus (shrinkage) alonwith the occurrence of apop￾totic bodies, nuclear membrane blebbing and chromatin condensation and fragmentation35 as shown in Fig. 6.
However, 300sec N2 CAP didn’t affect much on nucleus structure except some initial changes in nuclear mem￾brane, while control group shows prominent round shaped nucleus in all 3 human melanoma cell lines.
The present study illustrated that ROS induction after treatment with air and N2 CAP increased the levels of 
intracellular ROS that may be mediated through nox-1 and p53/atm gene expression levels. The generation of 
ROS by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase (nox) in response to apoptosis-related signaling 
is essential for signal transduction36,37. atm belongs to one of the largest protein kinase families and is responsible 
for regulating cellular responses and activating H2AX and p53 in the DNA damage signaling cascade38. G-361 
cells showed an increase of all apoptotic genes and nox 2, 4, 5 genes by A3 plasma treatment (Fig. 7f–h). The level 
of map38 and atm genes increased up to 40 folds (Fig. 7a,b) while p53 increased 14 folds (Fig. 7c) as compared to 
control. The level of cas8 and bax also increased 20 folds after A3 treatment (Fig. 7d,e). While at A5 treatments all 
the apoptotic genes decreased significantly as compared to A3 and comparable to the control group.
N3 treatment in G-361 cells has no effects on map38, atm, p53, and bax but cas8 was increased (Fig. 7a–e). All 
apoptotic genes were increased at N5 treatment results in an increase in apoptotic genes. The nox 1 and 3 gene 
expressions were not detected for the G-361 cell line, while nox 2 and nox 4 increased after A3 and N3 treatments.
SK-MEL-31 melanoma cells revealed an increase in p53, cas8, and bax levels after CAP treatment for A3, 
A5, and N3. The expression of apoptotic genes after N2 CAP treatment N3 significantly increased in all groups 
(Fig. 8). nox 1, 2, and 4 were not detected in the SK-MEL-31 cell line. However, an increased level of nox 3 was 
only detected N3 CAP treatment (3-fold), and the other treatments only showed insignificant increases (Fig. 8f). 
An increased level of nox 5 was detected after A3 (3-fold) and A5 (2.5-fold) treatment, while the level of nox 5
decreased after N2 CAP treatment for N5 (4.5-fold) compared to N3 (7-fold) respectively (Fig. 8g).
WM-266-4 melanoma cells showed an increase in all apoptotic genes after treating with air plasma (A3 and 
A5). Gene expression for map38 (10-folds), atm (15-folds), p53 (8-folds), cas8 (14-folds) and bax (15-folds) was 
increased after receiving A3 and comparable to p53, cas8 and bax after receiving A5 (Fig. 9a–e).
N2 CAP treatment (N3) increased some apoptotic gene expressions level. It increased map38 (18-folds), atm
(18-folds), cas8 (17-folds) and bax (40-folds) expression respectively compared to the control cells. N5 treatment 
didn’t show much changes in the expression level of map38 and atm gene and compared to control. N5 treat￾ment also increased the level of p53 (3-folds), cas8 (2-times) and bax (8-times) (Fig. 9a–e). nox3 gene was only 
expressed in A5 group while nox5 gene expression was increased in A3 and A5 (Fig. 9f,g).
Using western blot analysis we accessed the stimulation of caspase 3 using both air and nitrogen CAP treat￾ment on SK-MEL-31 and WM-266-4 human melanoma cell lines. cas3 activation was found in both of treatment

as compared to N2 CAP. It indicate parallel result with q-PCR gene expression especially with cas8 expression 
(Fig. S4).
Discussion
The poor diagnosis of metastatic melanoma despite conventional therapies has led to the development of new 
therapeutic strategies that not only treat the disease but also minimize the post-treatment effects39. Advances in 
model systems that closely simulate the human situation are much needed40. In the present study, we used a softjet 
CAP device with air and N2 feeder gases to analyze the inhibition rate in three human melanoma cell lines at dif￾ferent time intervals. The results revealed that the softjet CAP induced high cell death in the G-361, SK-MEL-31, 
and WM-266-4 human melanoma cells.
The physical characterization of softjet plasma devices by using both gases (air and N2) revealed the produc￾tion of highly reactive radicals. CAP originating using the ambient air contained radicals mainly from N2 and 
O2 (e.g., N, O, O3, NO, NO2, OH•
), while the CAP using N2 gas contained radicals of only unstable nitrogen 
species. The final products of these unstable species that reacted with the cell culture media results in the pro￾duction of H2O2 and NOx, which are quite stable. Even though it is still unclear which component of the softjet 
plasma induces toxicity. Therefore, we presume that this dose-dependent toxicity has the same tendency as the 
amounts of dissolved H2O2 and NOx in solution in published reports41. G-361 and SK-MEL-31 exhibited max￾imum cytotoxicity with 180 sec of air CAP treatment after 48 h and 72 h of incubation, respectively. This may

real-time RT-PCR and 18s rRNA was used as a reference gene. Student’s t-tests were performed, and the levels of 
significance are indicated as follows: *p<0.05; **p<0.01; and ***p<0.001.

be because of the interaction of CAP with liquid, which leads to various kinds of ROS in the culture media and 
linearly increases the level of intracellular ROS42,43. Because of the dependency of endogenous ROS generation on 
chemical induction, this direct ROS generation can be a good strategy for reducing melanoma. Previous reports 
stated that plasma induces cell death and reduced cell adhesion while interacting with organic components in cell 
culture media27,44, which leads to toxicity at later time intervals.
The cell death induced by soft jet plasma using 300 sec air and N2 CAP showed apoptosis in the G-361, 
SK-MEL-31 and WM-266-4 melanoma cells which was apparent by the DAPI staining method. This can plau￾sibly be explained by following two main processes: extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Signalling from the death 
receptors plays a key role in mediating external signals to caspase8 in the extrinsic pathway. Also, CAP treatment 
generate O2
•− which on reaction with liquid cell culture medium may produce HO2
•
 which is a strong oxidant 
than O2
•− and it can initiate lipid peroxidation of melanoma cells. NO2
− is more unstable than NO3
− and under￾goes very fast decomposition which leads to NO2
•
 and OH•
. These free radicals generation lead to another reason 
for apoptosis in melanoma.
In the molecular level, q-PCR analysis of the G-361 cells and WM-266-4 cells also revealed an increase in the 
casp8 signal after 180 sec (A3) of air CAP treatment and 300sec (N3) of N2 plasma treatment and this leads to the 
apoptosis. bax is a bcl-2 family gene that is related to the signaling of early apoptosis45. It was also reduced with A3 
plasma treatment and N3 plasma treatment in the G-361 cells and A3 plasma treatment and N3 plasma treatment 
in the WM-2664 cells. However, SK-MEL-31 showed more necrosis compared to the other two melanoma cell 
lines. Plasma treatment of A3 showed 22.41% necrosis, while A5 treatment decreased the necrosis to 5.5%. This 
was revealed by the casp8 and bax activity at the same given CAP doses. Apart from the oxidative stress induced 
by RONS generated from air and N2 CAP, map38 was generally phosphorylated46. Upregulation of phospho

map38 signaling after A3 plasma treatment of G-361 and SK-MEL-31 and N3 CAP treatment of SK-MEL-31 
and WM-2664 may upregulate apoptotic genes through distinct phosphorylation events. This can result in stress 
stimulating DNA damage46 and hence tumor cell death.
In our study, the softjet CAP using air and N2 ambient gases produced oxidative potential that was partially 
mediated through nox 1–5 enzymes and p53/atm overexpression. The gene overexpression in all three melanoma 
cell lines clearly indicates that RONS-dependent DNA damage triggered signaling leading to cell death. However, 
the actual damage to the different melanoma cells and the underlying mechanism must be studied to minimize 
the unexpected side effects of plasma medicine.
Based on the results of our experimental and computational study, we also propose the following mechanism 
for the ROS-regulated activation of p38 pathways and subsequent signaling events that lead to apoptosis (Fig. 10). 
The activation of the primary p38 pathway has been reported to lead to apoptosis and is induced by the activation 
of ASK147,48. In contrast, oxidative stress induced by RONS causes TRX to dissociate from ASK1, and the free 
ASK1 further activates p38 pathways that lead to apoptosis49,50. The protein-protein interaction results for ASK1 
and the TRX1-reduced form clearly showed that the catalytic residues Phe31, Cys32 and Cys35 of TRX1 oriented 
towards the Cys113 and Cys119 binding residues of ASK1. The calculated absolute energy score for this complex 
was 138,562.30 kcal/mol. Similarly, the analysis of the complex of ASK1 and the TRX1-oxidised form showed a 
similar interaction with a decreased absolute energy score of 128,488.17kcal/mol (Fig. S3). Our results corrobo￾rate earlier experimental studies showing that the activity of ASK1 is downregulated by the reduced TRX1 protein

real-time RT-PCR and 18s rRNA was used as a reference gene. Student’s t-tests were performed, and the levels of 
significance are indicated as follows: *p<0.05; **p<0.01; and ***p<0.001.

and upregulated when the TRX1 protein is oxidized (i.e. disulfide bond Cys32–Cys35). In other words, ASK1 is 
in its free form to propagate p38-mediated apoptosis48,51–59.
Oxidative stress with an increased concentration of RONS targets the ASK1:TRX1 protein complex and causes 
the release of TRX1 from ASK1 through the redox mechanism. The free ASK1 then phosphorylates p38 and acti￾vates the signaling cascade. The activated p38 induces the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins such as Fas and 
its ligand (FasL), bax, bim, or nox-a (all from the bcl-2 family) through the phosphorylation of the transcription 
factor (p53). Then, p38 can inhibit c-FLIP phosphorylation and impair its function as an inhibitor of cas 8 acti￾vations. The expressed pro-apoptotic proteins Fas and FasL activate pro-cas8 to cas8. This further activates cas3, 
which contributes to apoptosis.
In conclusion, the exact mechanism for the inhibitory effect of CAP remains unknown and needs to be further 
investigated. However, our results showed that air and N2 softjet CAPs are useful and powerful agents against 
human melanoma in vitro, where the main effects seem to be the activation of apoptosis and an increase in 
metabolic toxicity. For therapeutic applications, the different cellular responses to plasma treatment should be 
further screened according to cell morphology and cancer genotype and must be compared with the normal cells. 
However, our preliminary results show potential for the preferential killing of melanoma cells with softjet air and 
N2 CAP treatment in melanoma therapy.
