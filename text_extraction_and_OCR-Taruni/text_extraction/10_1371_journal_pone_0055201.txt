Abstract
Background: Lymphatic vessels play a pivotal role in fluid drainage and egress of immune cells from the lung. However,
examining murine lung lymphatics is hampered by the expression of classical lymph endothelial markers on other cell types,
which hinders the unambiguous identification of lymphatics. The expression of CD90/Thy-1 on lymph endothelium was
recently described and we therefore examined its suitability to identify murine pulmonary lymph vessels under healthy and
inflammatory conditions.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Immunohistochemistry with a monoclonal antibody against CD90.2/Thy-1.2 on 200 mm
thick precision cut lung slices labeled a vascular network that was distinct from blood vessels. Preembedding
immunostaining and electron microscopy verified that the anti-CD90.2/Thy-1.2 antibody labeled lymphatic endothelium.
Absence of staining in CD90.1/Thy-1.1 expressing FVB mice indicated that CD90/Thy-1 was expressed on lymph
endothelium and labeling was not due to antibody cross reactivity. Double-labeling immunohistochemistry for CD90/Thy-1
and a-smooth muscle actin identified two routes for lymph vessel exit from the murine lung. One started in the parenchyma
or around veins and left via venous blood vessels. The other began in the space around airways or in the space between
airways and pulmonary arteries and left via the main bronchi. As expected from the pulmonary distribution of lymph
vessels, intranasal application of house dust mite led to accumulation of T cells around veins and in the connective tissue
between airways and pulmonary arteries. Surprisingly, increased numbers of T cells were also detected around intraacinar
arteries that lack lymph vessels. This arterial T cell sheath extended to the pulmonary arteries where lymph vessels were
located.
Conclusions/Significance: These results indicate that CD90/Thy-1 is expressed on lymphatic endothelial cells and
represents a suitable marker for murine lung lymph vessels. Combining CD90/Thy-1 labeling with precision cut lung slices
allows visualizing the anatomy of the lymphatic system in normal and inflamed conditions.

Introduction
Lymph vessels are important to drain excess extracellular fluid
[1] and transport antigens as well as immune cells to lymph nodes
to initiate an adaptive immune reaction [2]. Especially in the lung,
fluid balance and efficient immune reactions are essential since
accumulation of fluid as well as failure to fight infections may lead
to impairment of gas exchange and ultimately death. Despite the
fact that a functioning lymphatic system is essential for lung
function, research on the lymphatic system in the respiratory
system in mice largely focussed on the trachea [3,4,5,6]. This is
mostly due to the fact that classical lymph vessel markers such as
podoplanin or LYVE-1, which are widely used to identify lymph
vessels in other organs also label other cell types in the lung that
hamper the unequivocal identification of lymph vessels [7,8].
Recently, CD90/Thy-1 was found to be highly expressed on
lymphatic endothelial cells and was implied to facilitate cell entry
into lymphatic vessels [9]. CD90/Thy-1 is a glycophosphatidyli￾nositol anchored strongly glycosylated protein that is expressed on
the cell surface and belongs to the class of the immunoglobulin
superfamily CD90/Thy-1 was originally identified as a thymocyte
antigen and is a pan T cell marker in mice [10]. It is also known to
be expressed by neurons [11] and fibroblasts [12].
The goal of this study was to clarify if CD90/Thy-1 is also
expressed on lung lymphatic endothelial cells and could serve as a

valuable marker for lymphatics in the lung under normal and
inflammatory conditions.
Our results show that CD90/Thy-1 is expressed strongly on
lymph vessel endothelium in the murine lung and can be used to
reliably identify lymph vessels in murine precision cut lung slices

even under inflammatory conditions. By combining labeling for
CD90/Thy-1 with precision cut lung slices we could identify the
anatomy of the intrapulmonary lymphatic vasculature and gain
insight into possible fluid drainage and immune cell routes in the
murine lung.
Materials and Methods
Mice
For light and electron microscopic studies of normal lungs, male
C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories Research Models and
Services Germany GmbH, Sulzfeld, Germany) aged 8 to 30 weeks
were used. For the model of allergic airway inflammation female
Balb/c mice (Charles River) aged 8 weeks were used. Both,
C57BL/6 and Balb/c mice express the CD90.2 variant of CD90/
Thy-1. To control for the specificity of the anti-CD90.2/Thy-1.2
antibody FVB mice (Charles River) were used that express the
CD90.1 variant of CD90/Thy-1. All animals were held according
to institutional guidelines with a 12 h day/night cycle and food
and drink ad libitum. All animal experiments were approved by
the Ministerium fu¨ r Landwirtschaft, Umwelt und la¨ndliche
Ra¨ ume des Landes Schleswig-Holstein or the Regierungspra¨ si￾dium Giessen and measures were taken to keep animal suffering to
a minimum.

Precision Cut Lung Slices
Animals were sacrificed by an overdose of isoflurane (Baxter,
Unterschleißheim, Germany). The thorax was opened and the
trachea was exposed. Blood from the lung was removed by cutting
the left auricle and injecting 5 ml of HEPES-buffered Ringer
solution into the right ventricle. The heart was then removed and
the lung was filled via the trachea with 37uC warm 3% low melting
point agarose (Bio Rad, Mu¨nchen, Germany) in HEPES-Ringer
solution. The lung was removed from the thorax en bloc and
transferred to ice cold HEPES-buffered Ringer solution. The left
lung was isolated and was glued with the hilum facing downwards
on cooled aluminium block using super glue (UHU, Bu¨hl,
Germany). Then, 200 mm thick sections were cut using a
vibratome. The individual sections were collected and were
subsequently incubated in 37uC warm HEPES-buffered Ringer
solution with continuous bubbling for 3 h with room air to remove
the agarose. Sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in
phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and washed three times.
After incubation overnight in 20% sucrose the sections were frozen
in the same solution at 220uC until further use.

Fluorescence Immunohistochemistry for Light
Microscopy
Cryosections (10 mm thickness) from 4% paraformaldehyde
fixed and sucrose cryoprotected lungs or precision cut lung slices
were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in TRIS-buffered
saline (TBS, pH 7.4) overnight. If fluorophore-conjugated primary
antibodies were used, the sections were washed in TBS and
coverslipped (sections on slides) or mounted between two cover
slips (precision cut lung slices) using buffered Mowiol 4–88, pH 8.5
(Sigma-Aldrich). To detect non labeled or biotiylated antibodies,
sections were washed in TBS and incubated with fluorophore￾conjugated secondary antibodies or with fluorophore conjugated
streptavidin, respectively for one hour. Then sections were rinsed
in TBS and coverslipped. For double-labeling of CD45 and
CD90/Thy-1 two modified protocols were used since both
antibodies were raised in rat. Both gave similar results. First,
sections were incubated with anti-CD90/Thy-1 antibody as
described above and detected using anti-rat Ig antibody conju￾gated with Alexa Fluor 488. Then, sections were incubated with
normal rat serum and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS to
block potentially free binding sites of the secondary antibody. After
a subsequent rinsing step, the slices were incubated with the
biotinylated rat anti-CD45 antibody overnight and detected using
streptavidin coupled to Alexa Fluor 555. Alternatively, the sections
were incubated with biotinylated anti-CD45 antibody overnight
and detected using a donkey anti-rat Ig antibody coupled to Alexa
Fluor 555. After washing, sections were incubated with normal rat
serum and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde to block free binding
sites of the secondary antibody. Subsequently, the sections were
incubated with anti-CD90/Thy-1 antibody coupled to Alexa
Fluor 488 overnight, rinsed and coverslipped. Sections were
evaluated by using an epifluorescence microscope (Axioskop 2 FS
plus, Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany) with
appropriate filter sets or a confocal laser scanning microscope
(510 Meta, Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH).
Preembedding Immunohistochemistry for Electron
Microscopy
For these experiments lungs from six C57BL/6 mice were used.
After thawing, the precision cut lung slices were transferred to
anti-CD90/Thy-1 antibody (1:3000 in antibody diluent (Invitro￾gen) or PBS) and incubated overnight at 4uC. Subsequently,
sections were washed in PBS and incubated with biotinylated anti￾rat Ig antibody (Dako, Hamburg, Germany, 1:400) with 5%
normal mouse serum (Invitrogen) in antibody diluent for 1 h. After
a washing step, sections were incubated with Vectastain Elite ABC
reagent (Elite PK 6100 Standard, Vectorstain Linaris Biologische
Produkte GmbH, Wertheim-Bettingen/Vector Laboratories, Bur￾lingame, CA) for 45 min. Diaminobenzidine solution (Vector
Laboratories) was added and sections were incubated under
microscopic control until sufficient immunostaining was achieved.
Sections were then washed in PBS and fixed in Monti’s fixative
(2% glutardialdehyde, 0.6% paraformaldehyde, and 0.03% CaCl2
in 0.06 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.35 [13]) overnight and
transferred to in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.3, followed by
incubation with 1% osmiumtetroxide in cacodylate buffer
overnight. After washing in cacodylate buffer, sections were
dehydrated by incubating them in increasing concentrations of
ethanol, transferred to propylene oxide, and left in a 1:1 mixture of
Araldite (Sigma-Aldrich) and propylenoxide overnight and were

transferred to Araldite for 30 min and then to fresh Araldite. The
sections were flattened between two glass slides covered by
polyethylene foil and were left at 60uC for two days. After
polymerization the foil was removed and sections were evaluated
under a microscope. Suitable areas were cut and glued to an
Araldite resin blind block. Semi thin sections were cut using an
ultramicrotome (Ultracut E, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Ger￾many). If a section contained a stained lymph vessel, ultrathin
sections were cut at approx. 80 nm and were transferred to copper
grids. Sections were contrasted in a contrasting system for

ultrathin sections (Leica EM AC20, Leica Microsystems) using
uranyle acetate ready to use solution (Leica Microsystems)
followed by lead citrate ready to use solution (Leica Microsystems)
and were subsequently evaluated using a transmission electron
microscope (Jeol JEM 1011, Eching, Germany).
Paraffin Sections
Lungs from C57BL/6 mice were fixed via the trachea with 4%
PBS-buffered PFA (pH 7.4) and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin
sections were cut and stained with Masson Goldner trichrome
stain (Sigma-Aldrich). Sections then were coverslipped and
evaluated by light microscopy.
Multiphoton Microscopy
Murine tracheae from C57BL/6 were explanted and kept at
37uC in HEPES Ringer solution throughout incubation and
imaging. FITC-conjugated rat anti-CD90/Thy-1 antibody was
added to the HEPES Ringer solution. After 1 h the tissue was
transferred to a DermaInspect multiphoton microscope (JenLab
GmbH, Jena, Germany) equipped with a 206 dip in objective,
(NA = 1.0, Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH) and a Mai Tai mode￾locked titanium-sapphire laser (Newport Spectra-Physics GmbH,
Darmstadt, Germany). Z-stacks were recorded using an excitation
wavelength of 750 nm and detecting autofluorescence and FITC
signals.
Model of Allergic Airway Inflammation
Female Balb/c mice (n = 6) were treated intranasally with a
crude extract of house dust mite (Greer, Lenoir, NC, USA) in PBS
(100 mg/50 ml) or PBS alone (n = 6) on days 0, 7, and 14. On Day
15 precision cut lung slices from the left lungs were prepared and
immunostained for light microscopic analysis with anti-CD90/
Thy-1 antibody and anti-a-smooth muscle actin antibody as
described above.
Results
Morphology of CD90/Thy-1-immunoreactive Vessels
In precision cut lung slices the anti-CD90/Thy-1 antibody
strongly labeled vessels that were found throughout the murine
lung (Figure 1A). The vessels started as blind capillaries in the
parenchyma (Figure 1B), were interconnected and exhibited
variable changes in diameter (Figure 1C). Larger vessels
occasionally contained valve like structures (Figure 1D). With the
exception of large vessels close to the hilum (Figure 1E), CD90/
Thy-1-immunoreactive vessels were not surrounded by smooth
muscle cells as judged by absence of a-smooth muscle actin
positive cells. The analysis is based on n = 9 animals.
To verify that the CD90/Thy-1-immunoreactive cells were
lymph vessels, we used preembedding immunohistochemistry on
precision cut lung slices.

Immunoreactive vessels were identified in precision cut lung
slices by their dark staining and could be readily identified in semi
thin sections (Figure 2A, B). Using electron microscopy electron
dense reaction product was found on endothelial cells of vessels
that neither had smooth muscle cell nor pericyte coating. Labeled
endothelial cells were in intimate contact to collagen fibers
(Figure 2C–E). Absence of pericytes and smooth muscle cells and
intimate contact to collagen fibers is a hallmark of lymph vessels.
The analysis is based on n = 6 animals.
Double-labeling of CD90/Thy-1 with Lymph Vessel
Markers
LYVE-1 and podoplanin labeled also other cells strongly
impairing their use as lymph vessel markers in the murine lung
(Figure 3A–C). Double-labeling of CD90/Thy-1 with antibodies
against the established lymph vessel markers LYVE-1 (Figure 3D–
F), and VEGF R3 (Figure 3G–I) confirmed that the CD90/Thy-1-
immunoreactive vessels are lymphatic vessels. However, also the
anti-VEGF R3 antibody gave a weak staining with considerable
background in the alveolar region compared to the anti-CD90/
Thy-1 antibody limiting its use in precision cut lung slices. The
analysis is based on n = 325 animals.
Specificity of the Anti-CD90/Thy-1 Antibody
To verify that lymph vessels indeed expressed CD90/Thy-1, we
used FVB mice that express the CD90.1 variant of CD90/Thy-1,
which is not recognized by the anti-CD90.2/Thy-1.2 antibody. In
precision cut lung slices from FVB mice no staining of lymph
vessels (Figure 4) or any other cells was detected with the anti￾CD90.2./Thy-1.2 antibody. Conversely, use of an anti-CD90.1/
Thy1.1 antibody labeled lymph vessels in FVB mice but not in
C57BL/6 mice indicating that the staining of the anti-CD90/Thy￾1 antibodies was specific for CD90/Thy-1 and that lymph vessels
indeed express CD90/Thy-1. The analysis is based on n = 3 FVB
mice and n = 3 C57BL/6 mice.

Distribution of Lymph Vessels in the Normal Murine Lung
We did not see qualitative differences in the distribution of
lymph vessels in C56BL/6 and Balb/c mice. By staining precision
cut lung slices with an antibody against a-smooth muscle actin it is
possible to identify arteries, veins and airways by their respective
specific smooth muscle cell morphology and distribution (Figure 5
and [14]). By combining staining for CD90/Thy-1 and for a￾smooth muscle actin, we found that lymph vessels in the murine
lung were either associated with veins or with airways (Figure 6A,
B). Intraacinar arteries that are running between alveolar ducts
were devoid of lymph vessels (Figure 6C). Lymph vessels were
close to pulmonary arteries as they were frequently located in the
connective tissue between airways and pulmonary arteries
(Figure 6D). Typically this area contained loose connective tissue
(Figure 6E) and lymph vessels that were frequently surrounded by
CD90/Thy-1-immunoreactive cells with lymphocyte morphology
(Figure 6F). Lymph capillaries that subsequently ran with veins
either started in the alveolar region (Figure 7A, B) or directly at
veins (Figure 7C). Capillaries that ran with airways were starting
either directly adjacent at the airway or within the connective
tissue between airways and arteries (Figure 7D, E). The analysis is
based on n = 9 mice.
Other CD90/Thy-1-immunoreactive Cells in the Lung
In addition to lymph vessels, other cells in the lung exhibited
CD90/Thy-1-immunoreactivity, but were easily distinguishable
from lymph vessels in precision cut lung slices. Confined to the
immediate hilar region, immunoreactive cells with the morphology
of fibroblasts were found (Figure 8A). Around airways, a dense
network of nerve fibers was CD90/Thy-1 positive (Figure 8B) and
CD90/Thy-1-immunoreactive cells with the morphology of
lymphocytes were also observed (Figure 8C). We verified that
nearly all of CD90/Thy-1 positive cells are leukocytes by co￾staining with an antibody to CD45 and detected co-staining for
CD90/Thy-1 and CD45 in 96.9260.12 (S.E.M., n = 6 animals)
(Figure 9A–D). Double-labeling of CD90/Thy-1 with CD3 further
indicated that most of the CD90/Thy-1-immunoreactive cells with
lymphocyte morphology are indeed T cells (Figure 9E–G, n = 3
animals).
Detection of Lymph Vessels in Living Tissue
Incubation explanted living murine tracheae with FITC-labeled
anti-CD90/Thy-1 antibody stained lymph vessels that could be
detected by multiphoton microscopy (Figure 10, and Movie S1).
Lymph vessels do not exhibit strong autofluorescence signal in
multiphoton microscopy and appear as dark holes. The analysis is
based on n = 4 animals.
Distribution of Lymph Vessels and Lymphocytes after
House Dust Mite Challenge
Exposure to house dust mite extract induced no obvious
changes in the distribution and morphology of lymph vessels
compared to the PBS treated animals. In both groups CD90/
Thy-1 immunostaining was restricted to the lymph endothelium,
T cells, fibroblasts and nerve fibers. Although lymph vessels
were surrounded by CD90/Thy-1-immunoreactive cells, confo￾cal imaging allowed identification of stained lymph vessels
(Figure 11). As T cells were CD90/Thy-1-immunoreactive, we
were able to evaluate specifically the distribution of T cells with
respect to lymph vessels. Very often, T cells were associated
with or even located inside lymph vessels (Figure 11E, F).
Frequently, CD90/Thy-1-immunoreactive T cells were found in
the alveolar region but accumulated predominantly around
veins and arteries. Around veins, T cells were close to
lymphatics (Figure 12A). Intraacinar arteries were devoid of
lymph vessels but exhibited accumulation of T cells (Figure 12B).
This T cell coat often continuously accompanied arteries and
was still present when the intraacinar arteries connected the
pulmonary arteries that accompanied airways (Figure 12C). In
this region T cells were mostly found around arteries and in the
connective tissue between arteries and airways that also
harbored the lymph vessels (Figure 12D). Around the parts of
the airways that were not oriented towards the arteries,
markedly fewer lymphocytes were found (Figure 12D). The

Discussion
In this study, we have shown that pulmonary lymph vessels
express CD90/Thy-1 and that immunostaining against CD90/
Thy-1 can identify lymph vessels under normal and inflammatory
conditions. Using CD90/Thy-1 staining in precision cut lung
slices, we were able to examine the distribution of lymph vessels as
well as T cells in the murine lung under normal and inflammatory
conditions.
Usefulness of CD90/Thy-1 as Marker for Lymph Vessels
Classical markers for lymph endothelium such as podoplanin
and LYVE-1 that reliably stain lymph vessels in other organs are
not very useful to identify lymph vessels in the lung as staining of
other cell types hampers the identification of lymph vessels (c.f.
Figure 3). This is due to strong expression in other cell types such
as blood endothelial cells and type II pneumocytes [8]. By using
precision cut lung slices we were able to show that the anti-CD90/
Thy-1 antibody used strongly labeled all sizes of lymph vessels in
the lung starting from the initial lymph capillaries to the large
vessels that exited the lung at the hilum. As with all other
‘‘specific’’ markers for lymph endothelium, CD90/Thy-1 is not
exclusively expressed on lymph endothelium. In the lung it is also
found on nerve fibers, fibroblasts and T cells. In principle, the

lung slices with antibodies against CD90/Thy-1 (green) and CD45 (red), and subsequent quantitative analysis (D) shows that more than 96% of CD90/
Thy-1-immunoreactive cells with lymphocyte morphology are also stained with CD45 (white arrowheads, cells positive for CD90/Thy-1and CD45; red
arrow, cell immunoreactive for CD90/Thy-1 only). In each animal, 90 to 150 CD90/Thy-1-immunoreactive cells were analyzed. E–G). Double-labeling
with antibodies against CD90/Thy-1 (green) and CD3 (red) indicates that most CD90/Thy-1-labeled cells with lymphocyte morphology are also CD3-
immunoreactive.

staining of other cell types can be a problem to identify lymphatic
vessels and have hampered the use of established markers in lung
research [8]. However, nerve fibers, fibroblasts and T cells can be
easily and unambiguously distinguished from lymphatics in
200 mm thick precision cut lung slices by their typical morphology.
The additional staining of T cells can even be beneficial as this
gives an insight into the distribution of T cells with respect to
lymphatics without the need for multiple antibodies. Although it is
reported that CD90/Thy-1 is expressed on human endothelial
cells [16], we did not observe any CD90/Thy-1-immunoreactivity
on blood vessels in healthy animals or in the model of
experimental airway inflammation used. From our data we
conclude that anti-CD90/Thy-1 antibodies can be used to
examine the morphology as well as the distribution of the
lymphatic system in the murine lung. Since we could also strongly
label lymph vessels in the freshly excised living mouse trachea
without any permeabilization step, CD90/Thy-1 is accessible for
antibodies on the surface of lymph vessels. It is therefore feasible to
use the antibody to detect lymph vessels in in vivo and ex vivo
imaging experiments and should also be suitable for FACS analysis
of lymphatic endothelial cells.

Anatomy of the Murine Lung Lymphatics and Possible
Routes for Extracellular Fluid Drainage
By using 200 mm thick precision cut lung slices and staining
against a-smooth muscle actin we have previously shown that
arteries, veins, and airways can be identified by their specific
distribution of smooth muscle cells [14]. Co-staining with an anti￾a-smooth muscle actin antibody allowed us to define the
distribution of the lymphatic vasculature of the lung with respect
to blood vessels and airways. We were able to identify two different
lymphatic drainage routes. One begins in the parenchyma and
leaves the lung via the veins. The other begins around the airways
and in the connective tissue between arteries and airways and
leaves the lung via the airways. In contrast to the human lung, we
did not observe a separate network in the pleura indicating that
pleural drainage occurs primarily via the lymphatic system around
the veins. Based on the distribution of both systems, most of the
extracellular fluid of the alveolar area will be drained via the vein
associated lymphatics, whereas extracellular fluid that is generated
around the airways will primarily be drained via airway associated
lymph vessels. Intrapulmonary lymphatics were devoid of smooth
muscle cells with the exception of large lymph vessels at the lung
hilum. This indicates that the intrapulmonary transport of lymph
in both systems primarily relies on compression of lymph vessels
during breathing and not on active contraction of smooth muscle
cells. The presence of valves within lymph vessels supports this
idea. Our results on the anatomy of murine lung lymphatics
derived from staining of precision cut lung slices by anti-CD90/
Thy-1 antibody staining are summarized in Figure 13.
Possible Routes for Immune Cells to Leave the Lung
Following application of house dust mite extract, we found
the expected accumulation of T cells adjacent to airways but
also in the alveolar region. At first sight it is surprising that the
effects of house dust mite extract application were not confined
to airways. However, the applied house dust mite extract could
also reach the alveolar space. In fact, the alveolar region seems
to be an important area for antigen uptake as Thornton and
coworkers have recently shown. Using an OVA model of
allergic airway inflammation, the authors demonstrated that
most of the OVA was taken up by dendritic cells in the alveolar
region and not in the airways [17]. Thus, the increased amount
of T cells, we observed indicates that house dust mite reached
the alveolar space and initiated an immune response there.
Based on the lymph vessel distribution, we expected that
immune cells in the alveolar region will travel to draining
lymph nodes via lymphatics around veins. Indeed, we found
accumulations of CD90/Thy-1-immunoreactive cells around
veins often close to lymphatics. Furthermore, we detected also
CD90/Thy-1-immunoreactive T cells in lymph vessels, indicat￾ing that indeed, T cells entered lymph vessels and are used for
egress. However, we also found substantial accumulation of T
cells around intraacinar arteries despite the fact that these
vessels were consistently devoid of lymph vessels. We also
observed that this lymphocyte cuff around arteries extended up
to pulmonary arteries that accompanied the airways. From our
experiments we cannot infer how T cells reach intraacinar
arteries and where they migrate. However, it should be noted

cells are found (A) around veins (V) and (B) around intraacinar arteries (IA). C) Accumulations of T cells around arteries are continuous from intraacinar
arteries to pulmonary arteries (PA). D) Around airways (AW), T cells preferentially accumulate around pulmonary arteries.

that the periarterial space has been recognized as a specific area
for immune reactions in a variety of lung diseases [18,19]. A
possible explanation is that there is a specialized capillary
network that accompanies arteries which allows cell recruitment
of inflammatory cells [19]. However, it has been recently
described that dendritic cells that take up antigen in the alveolar
region, migrate to airway adjacent areas [17]. It is therefore
tempting to speculate that cells from the alveolar region use
intraacinar arteries as guides to reach the airways.
Possible Functions of CD90/Thy-1 on Lung Lymphatics
The function of CD90/Thy-1 on lymphatic endothelial cells has
not been directly analyzed in vivo. The only existing publication
that addressed the expression of CD90/Thy-1 in lymphatic
endothelium demonstrated that blockade of CD90/Thy-1 im￾paired the attachment of tumor cells to lymphatic endothelium in
mouse and prevented attachment of mononuclear and polymorph
nuclear leukocytes to cultured human lymphatic endothelium [9].
This is in line with the proposed role for CD90/Thy-1 as a
mediator of leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells [20,21,22]. To
our knowledge, no other publication has yet specifically addressed
the function of CD90/Thy-1 on lymphatic endothelium. Howev￾er, indirect evidence points to a possible involvement of CD90/
Thy-1 on lymphatic endothelium in pulmonary inflammatory
processes as CD90/Thy-1 deficient mice show a reduced number
and altered composition of leukocytes during inflammation [20].
The authors did not address the involvement of CD90/Thy-1
expression on lymphatic endothelium and interpreted their results
as a recruitment problem for inflammatory cells to the airways.
Alternatively, it is possible that altered function of lymph
endothelium contributes to the phenotype since the effects
observed were not due to the expression of CD90/Thy-1 on T
cells as transfer of wild-type bone marrow from CD90/Thy-1-
deficient mice restored T cells that express CD90/Thy-1 but did
not restore the original composition and number of leukocytes
during inflammation.
CD90/Thy-1 on Pulmonary Fibroblasts
CD90/Thy-1 has been shown to be present on human, rat
and mouse lung fibroblasts and is down-regulated or absent in
fibroblasts of fibrotic lesions of patients with idiopathic lung
fibrosis [12,23,24]. Our observations confirm the presence of a
CD90/Thy-1 positive fibroblast population which is localized
close to the lung hilum. However, we did not find CD90/Thy-1
positive fibroblasts in other areas of the lung. It is therefore
possible that the increased fibrosis detected in CD90/Thy-1
knockout mice after bleomycin application [23] could also be
attributed to changes in lymph vessel function.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our data shows that CD90/Thy-1 is expressed
on lymph endothelium in the murine lung and can be used as a
reliable marker to examine the intrapulmonary lymphatic
Figure 13. Scheme of lymph vessels and model of cell exit from the murine lung tissue. Two separate routes for lymph vessels exist. One
begins in the parenchyma and leaves the lung via veins and the other begins around airways or in the connective tissue between airways and arteries
and follows the airways to leave the lung. Cells that have left the vasculature in the alveolar region can enter the lymphatic system by migrating to
lymph vessels around veins or by migration to lymph vessels around airways, possibly by using intraacinar arteries as guide.

system when used in combination with precision cut lung slices.
This technique opens up the possibility to get further insight
into the function of the intrapulmonary lymphatic system. Since
very well validated monoclonal antibodies against CD90/Thy-1
are commercially available, a reliable source for the reagents
exists and researchers do not have to rely on polyclonal
antibodies on the market that can change in their quality over
time and have to be validated for their specificity after
obtaining a new batch.
