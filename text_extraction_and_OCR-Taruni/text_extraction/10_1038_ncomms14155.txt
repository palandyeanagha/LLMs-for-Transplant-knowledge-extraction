The parasympathetic nervous system plays an important role in the pathophysiology of atrial
fibrillation. Catheter ablation, a minimally invasive procedure deactivating abnormal firing
cardiac tissue, is increasingly becoming the therapy of choice for atrial fibrillation. This is
inevitably associated with the obliteration of cardiac cholinergic neurons. However, the
impact on ventricular electrophysiology is unclear. Here we show that cardiac cholinergic
neurons modulate ventricular electrophysiology. Mechanical disruption or pharmacological
blockade of parasympathetic innervation shortens ventricular refractory periods, increases
the incidence of ventricular arrhythmia and decreases ventricular cAMP levels in murine
hearts. Immunohistochemistry confirmed ventricular cholinergic innervation, revealing
parasympathetic fibres running from the atria to the ventricles parallel to sympathetic fibres.
In humans, catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation, which is accompanied by accidental
parasympathetic and concomitant sympathetic denervation, raises the burden of premature
ventricular complexes. In summary, our results demonstrate an influence of cardiac
cholinergic neurons on the regulation of ventricular function and arrhythmogenesis.

The autonomic nervous system of the heart and its impact
on heart rate and rhythm are known for more than a
century1. Recent advances demonstrate the importance of
the cardiac neural network in the pathophysiology of atrial
fibrillation (AF). This is the most common sustained human
arrhythmia, with a rising incidence of up to 10% in octogenarians,
and leads to significant morbidity and mortality2,3. Cardiac
neurons are inevitably obliterated during catheter ablation4,
which is the therapy of choice for most patients suffering from
symptomatic AF. This technique is a minimally invasive
procedure performed to deactivate specific areas of abnormal
firing heart tissue especially in the left atrium around the
pulmonary veins. As the atrial neural network contains mostly
cholinergic neurons, an increase in heart rate after catheter
ablation is widely recognized to result from this partial atrial
denervation (PAD)2. Although PAD during catheter ablation
of AF seems to alter atrial electrophysiology beneficially4,5, its
impact on ventricular electrophysiology remains unclear.
Text book knowledge states that parasympathetic axonal
supply is limited to the atria6, but this paradigm has recently
been challenged7,8. There is some evidence supporting the notion
that extracardiac parasympathetic efferents are able to modulate
ventricular function9,10 and electrophysiology11 by involving
central and peripheral neural pathways12–14. In addition, cardiac
ganglia have been shown to influence ventricular repolarization
properties15. However, the relevance of cardiac cholinergic
neurons for ventricular electrophysiology is not yet understood.
Here, we present clinical data demonstrating impaired
ventricular electrophysiology following catheter ablation in
patients. Experimental data confirm that mechanical disruption
or pharmacological blockade of cardiac parasympathetic innerva￾tion shortens ventricular refractory periods (VRPs), increases the
incidence of ventricular arrhythmia and decreases ventricular
cAMP levels in mouse hearts. Confirmingly, immunohistochem￾ical stainings show that cardiac cholinergic nerve fibres run from
the atria to the ventricles in parallel to sympathetic fibres. The
results imply a vital role of atrial cholinergic neurons in the
modulation of ventricular electrophysiology.
Results
PAD decreases ventricular refractory periods. To investigate
whether disruption of cardiac neurons influences baseline
electrophysiology, we first performed electrophysiological studies
in mouse hearts (Fig. 1a–f). We determined standard electro￾physiological parameters including the VRP, which describes the
duration of time in which the cardiac cell is unable to initiate
another action potential. VRPs were shorter in PAD hearts
(23.4±0.9 ms) compared with control hearts (31.6±2.2 ms,
P ¼ 0.003, unpaired t-test; Fig. 1d), similar to atrial refractory
periods (see Supplementary Table 1), demonstrating that dis￾ruption of cardiac neurons distant from the ventricles influences
ventricular baseline electrophysiology. In control hearts, the
VRPs were shortened by ganglionic (22.4±1.0 ms, P ¼ 0.002,
Mann–Whitney test) or muscarinergic blockade (24.4±0.7 ms,
P ¼ 0.045, unpaired t-test) but not altered by b-blockade
(34.8±2.4 ms, P ¼ 0.391, unpaired t-test) or cholinergic stimu￾lation (35.6±1.2 ms, P ¼ 0.248, unpaired t-test). In PAD hearts,
ganglionic (22±0.9 ms, P ¼ 0.345, unpaired t-test), muscarinergic
(24.4±0.7 ms, P ¼ 0.484, unpaired t-test) or b-blockade
(25.2±0.5 ms, P ¼ 0.265, Mann–Whitney test) did not alter
VRPs. However, cholinergic stimulation in PAD hearts
(37.2±2.6 ms versus 23.4±0.9 ms, Po0.0001, unpaired t-test)
prolonged refractory periods to similar values as in control hearts
suggesting reversibility of PAD induced shortening of refractory
periods. Electrophysiological parameters obtained in vivo and
ex vivo are displayed in Supplementary Tables 1–4.
PAD reduces dispersion of ventricular wave propagation.
Next, we determined wave propagation velocity and dispersion
in conduction direction by using multi-electrode epicardial
activation mapping. Ventricular mapping during fixed pacing
indicated that mean epicardial wave propagation velocity did not
differ between PAD (0.77±0.05 m s  1) and control hearts
(0.89±0.05 m s  1, P ¼ 0.09, unpaired t-test; Fig. 1e). Of interest,
colour-coded reconstruction of isochrones in combination with
arrows representing the direction of conduction showed that
dispersion in conduction direction was significantly lower in PAD
(0.52±0.07 radian) compared with control hearts (0.91±0.12
radian, P ¼ 0.026, Mann–Whitney test; Fig. 1f) indicating that
cardiac cholinergic neurons impact the uniformity of conduction.
Cholinergic PAD increases ventricular arrhythmia occurrence.
To investigate whether modulation of the intrinsic autonomic
nervous system of the heart increases arrhythmia susceptibility,
standardized programmed stimulation was performed (Fig. 2a–d).
Compared with control hearts, we observed an increase in
susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias after PAD (10% versus
100%, Po0.0001, Fisher’s exact test; Fig. 2b). In control hearts,
ventricular arrhythmias occurred more frequently after ganglionic
blockade (10% versus 100%, P ¼ 0.002, Fisher’s exact test),
muscarinergic blockade (10% versus 100%, P ¼ 0.002, Fisher’s
exact test) or cholinergic stimulation (10% versus 80%, P ¼ 0.017,
Fisher’s exact test) in line with previous findings16. b-Blockade
(10% versus 20%, P ¼ 1.0, Fisher’s exact test) did not alter
arrhythmia susceptibility. In PAD hearts, ganglionic blockade
(100% versus 100%, P ¼ 1.0, Fisher’s exact test), muscarinergic
blockade (100% versus 100%, P ¼ 1.0, Fisher’s exact test) or
b-blockade (100% versus 60%; P ¼ 0.095, Fisher’s exact test) did
not influence arrhythmia occurrence. Cholinergic stimulation
reversed the increased susceptibility to arrhythmias in PAD
hearts (20% versus 100%, P ¼ 0.004, Fisher’s exact test).
Compared with controls (4.9±1.5), the ventricular arrhythmia
score was higher after PAD (25.4±5.8, P ¼ 0.003, unpaired
t-test; Fig. 2d). In control hearts, ganglionic blockade (36.8±11.4,
P ¼ 0.002, unpaired t-test) and muscarinergic blockade
(33.4±16.2, P ¼ 0.010, Mann–Whitney test) increased the
arrhythmia score, while it was not altered during b-blockade
(4.8±3.3, P ¼ 0.975, unpaired t-test) or cholinergic stimulation
(4.0±1.4, P ¼ 0.702, unpaired t-test). In PAD hearts, ganglionic
(38.8±20, P ¼ 0.745, Mann–Whitney test) or muscarinergic
blockade (15.6±4.9, P ¼ 0.228, unpaired t-test) did not influence
the arrhythmia score, while b-blockade (5.6±1.7, P ¼ 0.011,
Mann–Whitney test) or cholinergic stimulation (5.0±3.4,
P ¼ 0.036, unpaired t-test) reduced it. This suggests that PAD
or pharmacological modulation of cardiac autonomic tone
impacts arrhythmia susceptibility.
Cardiac cholinergic neurons decrease ventricular cAMP levels.
To analyse effects of local atrial nicotinergic stimulation on atrial
and left ventricular cAMP levels, we used a newly established
whole-heart Fo¨rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based
imaging method (Fig. 3a,b). Topical application of nicotine
(ganglionic stimulant) reduced isoproterenol (ISO)-stimulated
atrial (  16±3.3%; Fig. 3c left panel) and ventricular
(  16±3.5%; Fig. 3c right panel) cAMP levels in control hearts.
The effect of nicotine on ventricular cAMP levels was almost
completely abolished after PAD (  3.3±0.8%, P ¼ 0.018,
unpaired t-test; Fig. 3c). Ganglionic (  3.5±1.7%, P ¼ 0.023,
unpaired t-test) or muscarinergic blockade (  3.7±3.2%,
P ¼ 0.036, unpaired t-test; Fig. 3c) also blocked the response.
In the atrium, cAMP levels were as well reduced by local nicotine
application (  16±3.3%). This effect was not altered by PAD

(  12±3.1%, P ¼ 0.45, unpaired t-test). However, ganglionic
(  2.4±1.1%, P ¼ 0.009, unpaired t-test) or muscarinergic
blockade (  2.6±2.2%, P ¼ 0.011, Mann–Whitney test) reduced
atrial cAMP levels after local nicotinergic stimulation. Absolute
changes of cAMP levels after nicotinergic stimulation were 2.29 in
the atrium and 0.89 in the ventricle. Similar effects have been
observed after direct adenylyl cyclase activation using the soluble
forskolin analogue NKH477 (Fig. 3d). Here, nicotine reduced

ganglionic blockade (hexamethonium, 5  10  4 M; n ¼ 5; P ¼ 0.002; Mann–Whitney test) and by muscarinergic blockade (atropine, 1  10  5 M; n ¼ 5;

VRPs in controls. After PAD ganglionic, muscarinergic or b-blockade did not reduce the VRP. However, cholinergic stimulation in PAD hearts raised the VRP
(n ¼ 5; Po0.0001; unpaired t-test) suggesting reversibility of PAD-induced shortening of VRPs. (e) Wave propagation velocity (WPV) was not influenced

NKH477 stimulated cAMP levels in the atrium (  24±5.9%) as
well as in the ventricle (  16±3.6%), which were reduced after
muscarinergic blockade (atrium:  11±3.1%, P ¼ 0.019, paired t￾test; ventricle:  4.9±2.1%, P ¼ 0.039, paired t-test). Experi￾ments in isolated cardiomyocytes confirmed changes in maximal
cAMP levels (after ISO stimulation) due to cholinergic stimula￾tion (  55±8.4%) or muscarinergic blockade (  3.8±6.7%,
Supplementary Fig. 1). These results demonstrate that activation
of atrial cholinergic neurons by nicotine modulates atrial and
ventricular cAMP levels.
Cholinergic nerves traverse from the atria to the ventricle. To
investigate the interconnectivity of the atrial and ventricular
intracardiac autonomic nervous system, we examined the relation
between cholinergic ganglia and sympathetic/parasympathetic
neural fibres. Immunohistochemical staining of whole mount
murine hearts revealed fibres originating from atrial ganglia,
passing the coronary sinus towards ventricular myocardial tissue
(Fig. 4a–l; Supplementary Tables 5 and 6). Choline acetyl￾transferase (ChAT)-positive ganglia were mainly located around
the pulmonary veins. Both, sympathetic (tyrosine hydroxylase
(TH)-positive) and parasympathetic (ChAT-positive) structures
were located in close proximity to each other in the atria and
along the coronary sinus. From there, axons traversed towards
both ventricles via different routes (Fig. 5a–f). Up to the
ventricular apex, TH-positive fibres were predominant and tightly
intertwined with ChAT-positive fibres (Fig. 5f). Western blotting
against ChAT and against the vesicular acetylcholine transporter
(VAChT) confirmed the presence of a 70 kDa band (known to be
the neuronal ChAT isoform17) in the ventricles that was also
detectable in brain tissue (Fig. 5h; Supplementary Fig. 2), which
indicates the presence of a cholinergic system in the ventricles.
Native eGFP fluorescence of ChATBAC-eGFP mice demonstrated
a delicate network of parasympathetic fibres surrounding cardiac
myocytes (Fig. 5g). PAD resulted in a 61% removal of ganglia
which was revealed in haematoxylin and eosin-stained sections
(7.7±1.9 versus 19.7±3.2 ganglia, P ¼ 0.1, Mann–Whitney test;
Fig. 6) and whole-mount ChAT stainings of PAD hearts (6.2±0.3
ganglia). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(qRT-PCR) of the atria after PAD indicated a clear reduction of
Chat mRNA (0.11±0.08-fold to Cdkn1b and fat tissue, P ¼ 0.063,
Wilcoxon signed-rank test), as well as Th mRNA (0.55±0.2-fold
to Cdkn1b and fat tissue, P ¼ 0.078, Wilcoxon signed-rank test)
and RBfox3 mRNA (also known as NeuN), which is expressed
exclusively in neuronal nuclei18 (0.41±0.09-fold to Cdkn1b and
fat tissue, P ¼ 0.011, paired t-test; Fig. 6d).

hearts, ganglionic (hexamethonium, 5  10  4 M; n ¼ 5; P ¼ 0.002) or
muscarinergic blockade (atropine, 1  10  5 M, n ¼ 5; P ¼ 0.002) increased

in arrhythmia susceptibility in control hearts in line with previous findings16.
In PAD hearts, ganglionic (n ¼ 5), muscarinergic (n ¼ 5) or b-blockade

the atrial level impacts ventricular electrophysiology in humans,
we studied 111 consecutive patients (60±1 years, 60% male)
undergoing catheter ablation of paroxysmal AF (Supplementary
Table 7). During ablation at anatomical sites of cardiac ganglia in
the left atrium (Ligament of Marshall region, n ¼ 5; left superior
ganglionated plexus region, n ¼ 1; Fig. 7a) premature ventricular
complexes (PVCs) occurred in six patients with concomitant
vagal responses in five patients.
In 20% of all patients, atrial arrhythmias were detected during
follow-up after a blanking period of 3 months, irrespective
of PVC incidence. During follow-up, in six patients a PVC
increase was documented irrespective of AF recurrence (before
catheter ablation: 7±3.3 PVC h  1; after catheter ablation:
144±70 PVC h  1, P ¼ 0.031, Wilcoxon signed-rank test;
Fig. 7c). Meanwhile, QT dispersion (28±5 ms versus 40±6 ms,
P ¼ 0.011, paired t-test; Fig. 7d) as a marker of repolarization
heterogeneity increased after catheter ablation. In one of these
patients, a non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) was
detected during follow-up. In age- and gender-matched controls
(n ¼ 6) without a significant increase in PVCs per hour after AF
ablation (1.4±1.3 PVC h  1 versus 2.4±2.0 PVC h  1, P ¼ 0.5,
Wilcoxon signed-rank test), the ventricular repolarization
heterogeneity did not change (QT dispersion: 22±3 ms versus
24±3 ms, P ¼ 0.222, paired t-test).
AF ablation reduces parasympathetic and sympathetic activity.
The mean heart rate increased from 61±1 b.p.m. before to
69±1 b.p.m. (Po0.0001; paired t-test) 48 h after AF ablation
in all patients with sinus rhythm, indicating a reduction of
cholinergic control. Heart rate variability (HRV) and HRV
measurement during deep breathing (HRV-DB) indicated a
reduced tonic and phasic parasympathetic activity after catheter
ablation of AF (Supplementary Table 8).
In patients with an increase in PVCs after AF ablation, the
heart rate increased Z10 b.p.m. in four out of six patients
(59±4.4 b.p.m. versus 64±2.5 b.p.m., P ¼ 0.34, paired t-test)
suggesting parasympathetic denervation, while it did not change
in controls (66±5.4 b.p.m. versus 67±3.3 b.p.m., P ¼ 0.81,
Wilcoxon signed-rank test).
Cardiac I-123-meta-iodo-benzylguanidine (MIBG) single￾photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging
demonstrated a heart-to-mediastinum ratio of 1.61±0.05 in
patients with new onset of PVCs (n ¼ 4) and 1.56±0.12
(P ¼ 0.83; Mann–Whitney test) in patients without PVCs after
AF ablation (n ¼ 4). Semiquantitative analysis of sympathetic
denervation revealed a summed defect score of 3.0±1.8 with
regional defects of sympathetic innervation at the inferior and
inferolateral left ventricular wall in patients with PVCs after AF
ablation (Fig. 7b). Sympathetic innervation was less impaired in
patients without PVCs after AF ablation (summed defect score
0.5±0.5, P ¼ 0.43; Mann–Whitney test) indicating a relation

between the modulation of atrial cholinergic neurons, concomi￾tant sympathetic denervation and the occurrence of ventricular
arrhythmias.
Discussion
The major findings of the present study are as follows:
(i) morphological and functional evidence support that cardiac
cholinergic neurons regulate ventricular electrophysiology;
(ii) modulation of the atrial neural network changes left
ventricular cAMP levels; (iii) accidental partial atrial denervation
during catheter ablation of AF is characterized by both reduced
parasympathetic activity and disturbed sympathetic ventricular
control. This can translate into increased susceptibility to
ventricular arrhythmia after catheter ablation of AF.
It is well known that catheter ablation of AF inevitably
modulates the intracardiac neural network as supported by
morphological and functional studies2. The most obvious clinical
parameter is an increased heart rate, which is often used as a
surrogate parameter for withdrawal of sinus nodal or global
cardiac parasympathetic activity following catheter ablation of
AF19,20. Our indirect measurements of neural cardiac control
including heart rate, HRV at rest and HRV-DB, support a
decrease in both tonic and phasic parasympathetic activity after
catheter ablation of AF in our patient cohort. The former is in
line with several previous reports having found an impairment of
HRV following AF ablation21. Although still controversial,
observational studies22 and one randomized controlled trial5
support that atrial denervation (accidentally or targeted) can
reduce AF recurrence. Importantly, PVCs and VTs have been
reported following AF catheter ablation in patients without any
evidence of structural heart disease or inherited ion channel
diseases23–25. Our results support reports having speculated that
these arrhythmias might reflect autonomic influences26.
Atrial and ventricular neural structures are tightly
interconnected27,28. In addition, some studies support textbook
knowledge stating that beyond sensory afferents, ventricular
electrophysiology is primarily controlled by postganglionic
sympathetic efferent axons6,29. Although controversial,
ventricular innervation by parasympathetic fibres7,8 and
changes in ventricular repolarization following cervical vagal
nerve stimulation have been described11,14,30. This influence of
extracardiac vagal stimulation on ventricular electrophysiology is
relayed via different intracardiac ganglia15,30 but it is not fully
understood whether this effect is mediated via central or
peripheral neural pathways. Here, we present morphological
and functional evidence demonstrating that cardiac cholinergic
neurons modulate ventricular electrophysiology.
Stimulation of post-ganglionic neurons decreased ISO- and
Forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels in the ventricle, which was
blocked by PAD, the ganglion nicotinic antagonist hexametho￾nium, or the muscarinic antagonist atropine, indicating that
cholinergic neurons modulate ventricular function. This is also
supported by PAD-induced shortening of the VRP and immuno￾histochemical demonstration of intertwined TH- and ChAT￾positive fibres in the ventricle. However, one should keep in mind
that the behaviour of these neurons may be completely different
from in vivo conditions, as central inputs have been disrupted.

It also needs to be taken into account, that isolated
cardiomyocytes themselves have been shown to synthesize
acetylcholine31,32. Although it is not clear whether and how
this non-neuronal acetylcholine acutely modulates ventricular
electrophysiology, it might have influenced our results at least in
part. However, since acetylcholine was only detectable after
the addition of acetylcholine esterase inhibitors in isolated
myocytes31,32, it seems unlikely that non-neuronal acetylcholine
explains the functional effects observed in our study.
It is well known, that besides parasympathetic also sympathetic
activity can influence ventricular electrophysiology. Our experi￾mental and clinical data suggest that both the reduction of
parasympathetic activity as well as the concomitant heterogeneity
in ventricular sympathetic predominance are accountable for the

increase in arrhythmia susceptibility. Although the importance of
sole decreased parasympathetic activity in structurally healthy
hearts is less well defined, it is widely accepted that disturbed
sympathetic/parasympathetic interactions are proarrhythmic33,34.
It has been described that muscarinic receptors on adrenergic
nerve terminals attenuate norepinephrine release35, leading to
parasympathetically mediated inhibitory effects on cardiac
sympathetic activity. This indirect parasympathetic ventricular
control by opposing the effects of heightened adrenergic tone
might influence ventricular electrophysiology in Langendorff￾perfused hearts. However, b-blockade36 did not significantly
influence arrhythmogenesis in PAD hearts in our studies. PAD as
well as ganglionic or muscarinergic blockade led to an increased
susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias. This indicates that
intracardiac neurons continue to fire action potentials in an
ex vivo setup and are able to communicate with each other36,37.
In addition, FRET imaging confirmed the influence of atrial
neurons via a reduction of ventricular cAMP levels during local
application of nicotine, although these experiments were
performed under conditions of sympathetic stimulation or direct
cAMP activation. This influence on ventricular control was
abolished by muscarinergic or ganglionic blockade, while
cholinergic stimulation of PAD hearts prevented VT inducibility.
However, although some major patterns are similar in mouse and
man, extrapolating murine data to human studies may be difficult
as cardiac neuroanatomy is known to exhibit interspecies
variability38.
In conclusion, modulation of atrial cholinergic neurons
can acutely influence ventricular electrophysiology. Reduced
parasympathetic activity and concomitant spatial heterogeneity
of dominant sympathetic activity can translate into increased
ventricular arrhythmogenesis in some patients after catheter
ablation of AF.
Methods
Animals. The study protocol was approved by the local authorities of the State of
Hamburg, the University of Hamburg Animal Care and Use Committees and
conforms to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, Eighth Edition,
National Academy Press, updated by the US National Research Council Committee
in 2011.
Electrophysiological studies. We examined male wild-type C57/BL6 mice (10 to
16 weeks of age; Stock number Jackson Laboratories: 000664) electrophysiologically
by a single catheter technique39. To obtain baseline cardiac electrophysiological,
electrocardiographic (ECG) and echocardiographic parameters, in vivo studies
(n ¼ 10) were performed (Supplementary Tables 1–4)39. The mice were
anaesthetized with 2.4 Vol.% isoflurane and positioned on a temperature￾controlled platform to maintain body core temperature at 36 C. Surface resting
ECG was obtained and then analysed offline by using Powerlab 8/30 &
Labchart (ADInstruments, Dunedin, New Zealand). For echocardiography, the
parasternal long-axis view, short axis view and two-dimensional-guided M-mode
images were obtained at the level of the papillary muscles for the measurement of
wall thickness and chamber dimensions. Electrophysiological parameters like the
sinus node recovery time (maximum return cycle length after 10 s fixed-rate
pacing), Wenckebach periodicity (longest cycle length with loss of 1:1
atrioventricular-nodal conduction), atrioventricular-nodal refractory period
(longest extrastimulus cycle length with loss of atrioventricular-nodal conduction),
atrial and ventricular refractory periods (longest extrastimulus cycle length with
absent atrial or ventricular response) were determined by using fixed-rate or
extrastimulus pacing. In ex vivo Langendorff studies, the epicardial atrial fat pads,
in which atrial ganglia are mainly located, were either removed by careful
dissection40 (PAD) or left intact (control). For electrophysiological studies in a
Langendorff setup, hearts were submerged in ice-cold modified Krebs-Henseleit
solution (mM: NaCl 119, NaHCO3 25, KCL 4.6, KH2PO4 1.2, MgSO4 1.1, CaCl2
2.5, glucose 8.3 and Na-pyruvate 2; pH 7.4, 95% O2/5% CO2) and dissected
carefully. The aorta was cannulated, quickly attached to the perfusion system
(Hugo Sachs Elektronik/Harvard Aparatus, Germany) and retrogradely perfused at
constant pressure (80 mm Hg; ref. 41). The heart was surrounded by a fully closed
chamber, ensuring a precise temperature control. A 2F octapolar electrophysiology
catheter with 0.5 mm electrode spacing (CIB’ER Mouse, NuMed Inc., Hopkinton,
NY, USA) was inserted into the right atrium and right ventricle for recording of
intracardiac electrograms via an ECG amplifier (F104, ADInstruments). A second
2F octapolar catheter located epicardially at the left ventricle stimulated the heart
with a cycle length of 100 ms for the initial 20 min equilibration period. Hearts that
did not regain a pink colouration or a spontaneous heart beat after equilibration
were excluded. Perfusion pressure, aortic flow and heart rate were continuously
recorded using a digital data acquisition system and corresponding software
(Powerlab 8/30 & Labchart, ADInstruments). Programmed stimulation was
applied via the distal or proximal electrodes of the catheter using a designated
digital stimulus generator (STG4002, Multi Channel Systems, Reutlingen,
Germany) at twice the atrial or ventricular pacing threshold to determine standard
electrophysiological parameters42. In line with the Lambeth Conventions43,
programmed extrastimulation techniques (baseline cycle lengths 100 ms and
120 ms) with up to three extrastimuli and burst pacing with a 2 ms or 10 ms
stepwise reduction were used to detect arrhythmia susceptibility44–46. VT was
defined as Z4 consecutive premature ventricular complexes43. Ventricular
arrhythmias have been classified by an established scoring system47.
In addition to PAD (n ¼ 10) and control hearts (n ¼ 10), further experiments
(each n ¼ 5) were performed with the following drugs added to the perfusion
solution before starting the experiment: hexamethonium (ganglionic blockade,
5  10  4 M, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; n ¼ 5), atropine (muscarinergic
blockade,1  10  6 M, Sigma-Aldrich; n ¼ 5), propranolol48 (b-receptor blockade,
1  10  6 M, mibe GmbH, Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany; n ¼ 5), and
acetylcholine (cholinergic stimulation, 1  10  5 M, Sigma-Aldrich; n ¼ 5).
Pharmacological interventions were performed in additional experiments and only
one drug was tested per heart (control or PAD) to keep examination time similar
and to guarantee comparability in all performed experiments49.
Epicardial mapping of Langendorff-perfused hearts. Myocardial wave propa￾gation characteristics were determined by epicardial activation mapping with two
32-electrode arrays (EcoFlexMEA36, Multi Channel Systems, Reutlingen, Ger￾many; inter-electrode distance: 300 mm; 1.8  1.8 mm) positioned at both ventricles
during epicardial pacing (cycle length 100 ms) and induced ventricular arrhyth￾mias. Unipolar electrograms were recorded (ME128-FAI-MPA-System, Multi
Channel Systems, Reutlingen, Germany) with a sampling rate of 25 kHz. Data were
bandpass filtered (50 Hz), digitized with 12 bit and a signal range of 20 mV. Wave
propagation velocity and dispersion in conduction direction were determined50.
FRET-based cAMP imaging in whole hearts and cardiomyocytes. Fo¨rster
resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based measurements were performed in Lan￾gendorff-perfused hearts harvested from CAG-Epac1-camps transgenic mice51.
After measurement of baseline activity, the hearts were perfused with isoproterenol
(ISO, 1  10  7 M) or the NKH477 (1  10  5 M, both from Sigma-Aldrich) and

catheter ablation of AF concomitant with an increase in PVCs per hour, irrespective of AF recurrence. (d) QT dispersion after catheter ablation was

subsequently stimulated with nicotine (40 ml of 6.2  10  6 M, Sigma-Aldrich),
which was pipetted on the upper part of the left atrium52. These experiments were
performed in control (n ¼ 8) or PAD hearts (n ¼ 5) and with perfusion of atropine
(muscarinergic blockade, 1  10  6 M, Sigma-Aldrich; n ¼ 5) or hexamethonium
(ganglionic blockade, 5  10  4 M, Sigma-Aldrich; n ¼ 5). In hearts that were
prestimulated with NKH477, atropine (muscarinergic blockade, 1  10  6 M,
Sigma-Aldrich) was added directly to the perfusion buffer before performing an
additional nicotine stimulation. For single cell FRET measurements, adult murine
cardiomyocytes were freshly isolated via retrograde cardiac perfusion with an
enzyme solution containing 1.25 mg liberase DH (Roche Diagnostics Deutschland
GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) and 300 ml trypsin (2.5%, Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA, USA). After digestion, the calcium level was adapted and the cells
were plated onto glass-bottomed, laminin (Sigma-Aldrich) coated dishes53.
To monitor FRET, we used self-built imaging systems around Leica M165FC
(Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) stereomicroscope (for
Langendorff experiments) or Leica DMI3000B (Leica Microsystems GmbH)
inverted fluorescence microscope (for single-cell recordings). cAMP sensor was
excited with 440 nm LED (pE-100, CoolLED, Andover, UK). Emission light was
split into donor and acceptor channels using the DV2 DualView equipped with the
565dcxr dichroic mirror and D480/30 and D535/40 emission filters (Photometrics,
Tucson, AZ, USA). Images were taken using optiMOS camera (Photometrics,
Tucson, AZ, USA) with MicroManager 1.4 open source imaging software and
analysed by Image J (NIH, USA). Raw data were corrected offline for the
bleedthrough factor of the donor into the acceptor channel54.
Histology and immunohistochemistry. Whole-mount immunostainings were
performed in intact murine hearts to examine the interconnectivity of atrial
and ventricular neural structures within the intracardiac neural network and
cholinergic ventricular innervation55. Neurofilament staining (chicken anti NF-H,
1:3,000; EMD Millipore) was used to characterize the intracardiac neural network
traversing along the pulmonary veins, the posterior left atrium and both ventricles.
We used fluorescent and chromogenic labelling for TH and ChAT (goat a ChAT,
1:50; EMD Millipore; rabbit a TH, 1:1,000; EMD Millipore) to characterize
adrenergic and cholinergic structures35,55,56. Male ChATBAC-eGFP transgenic mice
were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, USA; stock number
007902; ref. 57). For imaging of native eGFP fluorescence, hearts were extracted
and perfused with ice-cold PBS.
Immunohistochemistry—whole-mount staining. After Langendorff perfusion,
mouse hearts were fixed in formalin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 h at 4 C and stored in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Biochrom GmbH, Germany) until the staining
was performed. Hearts were bleached in Dent’s bleach (4:1:1 MeOH: H2O2: DMSO,
Merck KGA, Darmstadt, Germany) for 1 week at 4 C and subsequently rehydrated
to PBS in a series of descending MeOH in PBS (100, 75, 50, 25%, 1 h each)58. The
following incubations were performed in 24-well-plate format with gentle agitation
at 4 C. The hearts were permeabilized in 1% Triton X-100/PBS (PBS-T, Sigma￾Aldrich) for 3  1 h at room temperature before blocking overnight in blocking
buffer (5% BSA/PBS-T (Biomol, Hamburg, Germany) þ 0.2% sodium azide).
Antibodies were diluted as follows: goat a ChAT (1:50; EMD Millipore), rabbit a
TH (1:1,000; EMD Millipore), chicken a neurofilament (1:3,000; EMD Millipore);
for fluorescent labelling: donkey a rabbit IgG Alexa 488 (1:500; Thermo Fisher
Scientific), donkey a goat IgG Alexa 568 (all 1:500; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and
donkey a chicken IgY Alexa 647 (all 1:500; Thermo Fisher Scientific); for
chromogenic labelling: biotin-conjugated donkey a rabbit igG (1:200; EMD
Millipore), biotin-conjugated donkey a goat igG (1:200; R&D Systems),
biotin-conjugated goat a chicken igY (1:200; R&D Systems); see also
Supplementary Tables 5 and 6.
Specimens were incubated in primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for
1 week. Afterwards, the hearts were washed 3  15 min in PBS-T before secondary
antibody incubation in blocking buffer for 4 days. Subsequently, the hearts
were washed 3  15 min in PBS-T and stored in Vectashield mounting medium
(#H-1000, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) for fluorescent staining or
incubated in Vectastain ABC kit (#PK-4000, Vector Laboratories) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions for 3 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the hearts
were pre-incubated 1 h in Steady DAB/Plus (#ab103723, Abcam plc, Cambridge,
UK) without DAB, before developing under visual control in Steady DAB
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The specimens were stored in
double-distilled H2O.
Histology—paraffin sections. Mouse hearts were prepared and fixed as described
above and subsequently dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. Four micrometre￾thick sections were cut and deparaffinized using HistoClear (#HS2002, DiaTec,
Bamberg, Germany) and ethanol. No antigen retrieval was performed. The slides
were permeabilized for 10 min in 0.2% Triton X-100/Tris-buffered saline (TBS),
followed by 3  5 min washes in TBS. Blocking was performed with 3% BSA/TBS
for 1 h at room temperature. Antibodies were diluted as follows: goat a ChAT
(1:50; EMD Millipore), rabbit a TH (1:500; EMD Millipore), chicken a neurofi￾lament (1:1,000; EMD Millipore), donkey a rabbit IgG Alexa 488 (1:500; Thermo
Fisher Scientific), donkey a goat IgG Alexa 568 (1:500; Thermo Fisher Scientific)
and donkey a chicken IgY Alexa 647 (1:500; Thermo Fisher Scientific; see also
Supplementary Tables 5-6) in 1% BSA/TBS. Incubation was performed overnight
at 4 C (primary antibody) or 2 h at room temperature (secondary antibodies)
with 3  5 min washes TBS in between. 1 mg ml  1 bisBenzimide H33342
trihydrochloride (Hoechst, #B2261, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the secondary
antibody solution. The slides were mounted in Vectashield HardSet mounting
medium (#VEC-H-1400, Vector Laboratories).
For quantification of cardiac ganglion removal, control and PAD hearts were
cut in 5 mm thick sections, haematoxylin and eosin stained, partitioned in four
regions and the number of ganglia was counted microscopically in a standardized
way by two independent scientists (K.S. and N.B.)59.
Microscopy. Confocal images of fluorescent whole mount and paraffin section
stainings were taken with either a Leica TCS SP5 (Leica Microsystems GmbH)
using  10 NA ¼ 0.3 HCPL Fluotar,  20 NA ¼ 0.7, HC PL Apo CS Imm/Corr oil
and  40 NA ¼ 1.3 HCX PL APO CS objectives or a 2-photon BX61WI upright
microscope (Olympus Cooperation, Tokyo, Japan) using a plan-Neofluar  5
NA ¼ 0.15 objective. Three-dimensional multicolour images were collected over
the full range of the signal with sequential channel acquisition of each stack for
whole mounts. A maximum projection image was created using the Leica LASAF
software. Images of chromogenic stainings and overview of whole fluorescent
hearts were photographed using an Olympus SZX16 wide zoom stereo microscope
(Olympus Cooperation). Three different focal planes were collected for chromo￾genic stainings and stacked using the Helicon Focus Software (HeliconSoft Ltd.). If
necessary, brightness and contrast was adapted using GNU Image manipulation
programme (GIMP). For quantification of ganglia in whole-mount ChAT-stained
hearts, ganglia were counted manually on the SZX16 microscope.
Immunoblotting. Expression of sympathetic and parasympathetic markers was
analysed in cardiac ventricular tissue via immunoblotting. Brain tissue served as
positive control. Tissues were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris base pH 8.0,
150 mM sodium chloride, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS), 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM dithiothreitol, plus proteaseinhibitors (Complete
Mini, Roche Diagnostics Deutschland GmbH) and phosphataseinhibitors (phos￾STOP, Roche Diagnostics Deutschland GmbH) using a glass-teflon potter and
centrifuged for 30 min at 15.000g, 4 C (ref. 60). Protein concentrations in the
homogenates were quantified using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The separation of
25 mg total protein was performed under denaturing conditions by sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gels (SDS–PAGE) using precast gels (4–20%, Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA, USA) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes via wet blotting.
The membranes were blocked in 5% skim milk powder in TBS. For goat-derived
antibodies, blocking was performed in 5% BSA/TBS (receptor grade, Serva,
Heidelberg, Germany). The membranes were incubated overnight at 4 C with
primary antibodies as follows: goat a ChAT (1:500, EMD Millipore), rabbit a TH
(1:1,000; EMD Millipore), goat a VAChT (1:500, EMD Millipore); see also
Supplementary Table 5. After three washing steps with TBS þ 0.5% Tween, sec￾ondary antibody incubation followed for one hour at room temperature: POX￾conjugated horse a goat igG (1:10,000; Vector Laboratories) and POX-conjugated
goat a rabbit igG (1:10,000; Vector Laboratories). Incubation with HRP-conjugated
rabbit a GAPDH 14C10 (1:2,000; Cell Signaling) for 1 h was performed to detect
GAPDH as a loading control. The Fusion Solo S gel documentation system (VRW
International, Radnor, PA, USA) was used to detect reactive protein bands with
enhanced chemiluminescence.
RNA isolation and qRT–PCR. RNA was isolated using Trizol (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) and further purified using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA was reverse
transcribed using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). qRT-PCR was performed on a 7900 TaqMan system (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using TaqMan gene expression mastermix and
gene expression assays (Rbfox3 Mm01248771_m1; Chat Mm01221880_m1; Th
Mm00447557_m1; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Nppa (mNPPA_Mm01255748_g1)
was used as a control for atrial tissue preparation, 10-40 ng of cDNA were used as
reaction template; experiments were performed in duplicates. Cycling conditions
were as follows: 50 C for 2 min; 95 C for 10 min (one cycle), 95 C for 15 s and
60 C for 1 min (40 cycles). Relative gene expression was calculated using the
2  DDCt method, normalizing to Cdkn1b (Mm00438167_g1) and fat tissue61.
Cdkn1b is not differentially expressed in fat and atrial tissue.
Study protocol. All patients gave written informed consent. Patient studies were
approved by the local Ethics Committee (No.: WF-01/16) and in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki. The clinical trial registration can be found with the
following URL (https://clinicaltrials.gov) under the unique identifier
NCT02699255. The burden of ventricular arrhythmias was investigated in an
observational study including 111 consecutive patients with paroxysmal AF
undergoing catheter ablation. All patients underwent catheter ablation of AF using
radiofrequency or cryoablation by an experienced electrophysiologist (41,000 left
atrial catheter ablation procedures each) and were continuously monitored for 48 h

after the procedure. Ganglia were not identified by high-frequency stimulation￾evoked bradycardia. Vagal responses during radiofrequency application were
defined as a decrease of heart rate by Z20% (ref. 62). Heart rate analysis was
performed only in patients, which were in sinus rhythm before and after the
procedure (n ¼ 93). The patients were asked to visit an outpatient clinic 3 and 6
months after the catheter ablation; 12-lead ECG or 24 h Holter monitoring was
performed on the patients at every visit and whenever patients complained about
symptoms. Antiarrhythmic drug therapy was discontinued after catheter ablation
of AF. All patients continued oral anticoagulation for a minimum of 3 months. AF
recurrence was defined as any episode of atrial tachycardia (AF, atrial flutter, atrial
tachycardia) of at least 30 s in duration. In patients with cardiac implantable
electrical devices, interrogation for arrhythmia detection was additionally
performed. Patients with previous documentation of 430 PVCs h  1 (ref. 63),
salvos or VTs, myocardial infarction, open heart surgery or percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty within less than 2 months before first AF
ablation were excluded. For asymptomatic (430 PVCs h  1) or symptomatic
(onset of palpitations or shortness of breath) patients, experiencing a PVC increase
after catheter ablation of AF, the QT dispersion was analysed as a marker of
ventricular repolarization heterogeneity before and after catheter ablation by two
independent investigators (C.J. and T.S.)64. Patients with an increase in PVCs
(n ¼ 6) after AF ablation and an age- and sex-matched control group (n ¼ 6) were
analysed65.
Characterization of cardiac neural control. Parameters of cardiac neural control
were investigated in a subset of 10 patients (64±10 years) before and after catheter
ablation of AF. For indirect assessment of tonic parasympathetic activity, HRV
analysis was performed at rest according to the guidelines of the European Society
of Cardiology66. The public domain Kubios HRV Software 2.0 (Biosignal Analysis
and Medical Imaging Group, Department of Physics and Mathematics, University
of Eastern Finland, Finland) was used for data analysis. HRV-DB with calculation
of the expiratory–inspiratory heart rate difference (E–I difference) and ratio
(E–I ratio) were performed to characterize phasic parasympathetic activity67.
To investigate the impact of AF ablation on regional left ventricular sympathetic
innervation, cardiac planar SPECT imaging was performed 4 h post injection of
185 MBq of MIBG (Adreview, Eindhoven, GE Healthcare B.V., The Netherlands)
in patients with or without PVCs following catheter ablation of AF. Data
acquisition was performed using a two-head SPECT system with standard LEHR
collimators of the manufacturer (ECAM variable angle or Symbia T; Siemens
Medical Solutions, Hoffman Estates, IL, USA). We used a circular 180 degrees
acquisition orbit, 32 projections (64 images) with 40 s per projection (zoom 1.45,
matrix 64  64). After reconstruction, all SPECT data were analysed using the
corridor 4D-MSPECT software package (Version 5.1, INVIA Medical Imaging
Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and the dedicated normal MIBG database of the
Japanese Society of Nuclear Medicine68. Standardized regions of interest (ROIs) for
the heart were drawn under careful consideration of the left ventricular border
excluding surrounding lung and gastrointestinal areas with MIBG uptake and
closing the ROI at the base of the left ventricle. A mediastinal ROI of at least 4 cm2
in size was placed over a mediastinal region with visual minimum of regional tracer
uptake. The heart to mediastinum ratio was calculated 4 h post injection. Using the
17-segment model of the American Heart Association and the dedicated normal
data base of the Japanese Society of Nuclear Medicine, regional tracer uptake was
analysed semiquantitatively68 using a summed defect score (0 for physiological and
4 for absent tracer uptake), which was calculated as the sum of all segmental defect
scores.
Statistical analysis. Continuous variables are reported as mean±s.e. of the
mean (s.e.m.) and categorical variables as absolute and relative numbers. The
sample size was chosen according to current state-of-the-art experimental setup
and practicability69. No randomization was done to assign animals to experimental
groups and no statistical method was used to estimate sample size for animal
studies. Investigators were not formally blinded during the experiment or when
assessing the outcome, but no subjective assessments were made. Normal
distribution was analysed using Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Parametric tests were
not chosen when variances between the compared groups were significantly
different and the number of compared values was not similar. For comparisons
between groups with normally distributed data, Student’s t-test was used for
continuous variables. To compare differences across subgroups with not normally
distributed data, Mann–Whitney or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used, as
appropriate. Differences in incidences of VT occurrence were analysed using
Fisher’s exact test. Statistical significance was defined as a P value of o0.05 and is
indicated in the figures. Statistical analysis was performed using Graphpad Prism 5
(Graphpad Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).
Data availability. The clinical study design has been registered at Clinicaltrials.gov
under the identifier NCT02699255. The other data supporting the findings of this
study are included in the article and its Supplementary Information files or are
