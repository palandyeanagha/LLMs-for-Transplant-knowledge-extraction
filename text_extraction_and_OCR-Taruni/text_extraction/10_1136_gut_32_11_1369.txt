Predicting cholangiocarcinoma in patients with
primary sclerosing cholangitis before transplantation

Abstract
Patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis
are at an increased risk of developing cholan￾giocarcinoma, which is difficult to diagnose
because the biliary tree is already distorted.
Eleven patients with primary sclerosing cholan￾gitis who underwent orthotopic liver trans￾plantation at this hospital were evaluated. Four
patients had coincidental histologically proved
cholangiocarcinoma. Patients with cholangio￾carcinoma in contrast to patients without
tumour presented with rapid onset of persist￾ent jaundice, pruritus, and weight loss associ￾ated with an appreciable rise in bilirubin (8X v
2x) and alkaline phosphatase (3.5x v 1.2x)
over one year. Cholangiography and computed
tomography showed appreciably dilated intra￾hepatic bile ducts (3/4 v 0/7). The diagnosis of
cholangiocarcinoma could only be established
before operation in one patient by fine needle
aspiration cytology. Tumour was recognised
at operation in one other. Histological exami￾nation of hepatectomy specimens showed that
patients with cholangiocarcinoma had less
advanced histological features of primary
sclerosing cholangitis. Multiple areas of
carcinoembryonic antigen positive epithelial
atypia and carcinoma in situ were found in all
patients with cholangiocarcinoma. Cholangio￾carcinoma recurred in two patients at 14 and 39
months after transplantation. Superimposed
cholangiocarcinoma can be predicted in most
patients with cholangitis before transplanta￾tion, although a definitive diagnosis is difficult
to make. Their prognosis after successful
transplantation is guarded.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a chronic
cholestatic disorder of unknown cause character￾ised by multiple fibrotic strictures of the intra
and extrahepatic bile ducts. The rate of progres￾sion of the disease is unpredictable, although up
to 49% of symptomatic patients eventually
develop biliary cirrhosis and liver failure.' Thus
increasing numbers of patients with primary
sclerosing cholangitis are being considered for
liver transplantation. Currently, it is the second
most common indication for adult liver trans￾plantation at our institution.2
Recent reports suggest that patients with
primary sclerosing cholangitis are at an increased
risk for the development of cholangiocar￾cinoma,3-5 This fatal complication is, however,
difficult to diagnose due to the distorted biliary
tree. Currently, the only methods of detecting
cholangiocarcinoma with absolute certainty in
these patients is complete examination of the
liver and biliary tree at necropsy or more recently
after total hepatectomy. The aim of this study
was to determine clinical, laboratory, and radio￾logical features of patients with end stage
primary sclerosing cholangitis which predicted
superimposed cholangiocarcinoma.
Methods
All adult patients undergoing orthotopic liver
transplantation at this hospital from January
1985 to September 1989 were evaluated for
primary sclerosing cholangitis. A diagnosis
was made if patients satisfied three criteria:
(a) typical cholangiographic findings (multiple
strictures, diverticula) of the intra or extra￾hepatic bile ducts shown by endoscopic retro￾grade cholangiography (ERCP) or percutaneous
transhepatic cholangiography (PTC); (b) histo￾logical examination of the total hepatectomy
specimen suggestive of the disease (periportal
fibrosis, fibrous obliterative cholangitis, or
biliary cirrhosis); (c) no other cause for biliary
cirrhosis.
Patients who met these criteria were divided
into two groups depending on the presence or
absence of coincidental cholangiocarcinoma
documented in the hepatectomy specimen.
Clinical, laboratory, radiological, and histo￾logical features of both groups were compared.
Clinical parameters assessed were indications for
transplantation, age, duration (years) of colitis
(histologically proved), duration (years) of
primary sclerosing cholangitis (from the time of
compatible cholangiographic or histological
evidence), and previous operations. Laboratory
test results recorded were serum bilirubin,
albumin, prothrombin time, fibrinogen, alkaline
phosphatase, aspartate transaminase, y glutamyl￾transferase, and carcinoembryonic antigen. The
increase in bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase
over 12 months before operation was calculated
as a ratio (concentration at the time of trans￾plantation divided by the concentration one year
before).
Cholangiograms (PTC or ERCP) were asses￾sed by one radiologist for the presence of a
dominant stricture and progressive dilation (if
sequential films were available). Pronounced
ductal dilatation was diagnosed (according to
criteria proposed by MacCarty et al6) if the
diameter of the common bile duct was greater
than 2.0 cm, left hepatic duct greater than 1.0
cm, right hepatic duct greater than 08 cm, or
intrahepatic ducts greater than 0.5 cm. As the
magnification factor could not be corrected,
measurements were approximate. The presence
of mass lesions on computed tomography or
ultrasound was recorded. Attempts to exclude
extrahepatic spread of suspected tumour before
transplantation included technetium methylene
diphosphonate bone scanning, computed tomo￾1369

All hepatectomy specimens were reviewed by
one pathologist. Primary sclerosing cholangitis
was staged according to the criteria of Ludwig
et al7: stage I, cholangitis or portal hepatitis;
stage II, periportal fibrosis or periportal hepatitis;
stage III, septal fibrosis or bridging necrosis;
stage IV, biliary cirrhosis. Patients with cholan￾giocarcinoma were also assessed for the tumour
type, site, and spread. The bile ducts were
reviewed for atypia and other foci of carcinoma.
Orthotopic liver transplantation followed
standard techniques previously described8
except for the use of a Roux-en-Y choledocho￾jejunostomy for the biliary anastomosis. Post￾operatively, the patients were treated with
prednisolone and cyclosporin.
All results are expressed as mean and range of

CLINICAL FEATURES
Eleven patients (four men, seven women), mean
age 40 years (range 17-48 years), received a
transplant for primary sclerosing cholangitis.
Four of these patients with coincidental cholan￾giocarcinoma were compared with the seven
patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis
alone. The clinical presentations of both groups
are given in Table I. Three of the four patients
with cholangiocarcinoma had a sudden persist￾ent deterioration in their clinical state, with
weight loss (range 6-20 kg), pruritus, and severe
jaundice. The fourth patient with clinically

unsuspected cholangiocarcinoma received a
transplant for recurrent episodes of cholangitis
and slowly progressive biliary cirrhosis.
Thirteen years before transplantation a liver
biopsy specimen had shown evidence of biliary
cirrhosis, with cholangiography showing a
dominant stricture of the common hepatic duct.
Despite several drainage operations, she con￾tinued to have cholangitis. All patients with
cholangitis only received a transplant due to poor
quality of life secondary to end stage cirrhosis
complicated by encephalopathy (two patients),
variceal bleeding (four), severe ascites (two), or
recurrent cholangitis (two). Apart from the
mode of presentation, no great differences in
clinical features existed between the two groups
(Table I). Ten of the 11 patients had evidence of
previous inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative
colitis seven, non-specific colitis two, Crohn's
colitis one).
LABORATORY FEATURES
Laboratory test results for the two groups before
transplantation are given in Table II. Patients
with cholangitis alone tended to have worse
indices of synthetic liver function, although due
to the small numbers this was not significant.
Patients with cholangiocarcinoma had a pro￾nounced rise in bilirubin (8 x v 2 x) and alkaline
phosphatase (3.5 x v 1 -2 x ) over the year before
transplantation (Table II). The bilirubin concen￾trations of all patients over the year before
transplantation are shown in Figure 1. Serum
carcinoembryonic antigen was raised at the time
of operation in two of four patients with cholan￾giocarcinoma (5 6, 61 [tg/l, normal <5 [ig/l) and

in one patient without tumour (27.5 ,ug/l). One
month after transplantation it was normal in each
of the patients with tumour but was still high in
the patient with benign disease (15-6 [ig/l) one
month before his death. In two patients tumour
recurred. In one of these patients where serum
was available the carcinoembryonic antigen con￾centration was high (155 ,ug/l at 21 months).
RADIOLOGY
Radiological comparison of the two groups is
given in Table III. Although three of seven
patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis
alone and all patients with cholangiocarcinoma
had a dominant stricture at cholangiography,
only patients with cholangiocarcinoma developed
massive ductal dilatation or progressive dilata￾tion (Fig 2A and B).
HISTOLOGY
Hepatectomy specimens from all 11 patients
showed histological evidence of primary scleros￾ing cholangitis. All patients with cholangitis
alone had end stage biliary cirrhosis (stage IV
primary sclerosing cholangitis), while patients
with coincidental cholangiocarcinoma presented
at an earlier stage: two had septal fibrosis only
(stage III), and two early cirrhosis or cirrhosis
restricted to part of the liver only (stage IV).
Features universally present included focal bile
duct proliferation, cholate stasis, cholestasis,
and accumulation of copper associated protein at
nodule or lobule margins. No granulomas were
present.
Large intrahepatic bile ducts in patients with
cholangiocarcinoma were appreciably dilated,
although mild dilatation was also found in one
patient with cholangitis alone. Intra and extra￾hepatic bile ducts in all 11 patients otherwise
showed similar features. Large extrahepatic
ducts showed mural fibrosis and chronic inflam￾mation, whilst large intrahepatic ducts showed
periductal lamellar fibrosis and atrophy of ductal
epithelium. Fibrous scars occurred at sites of
duct loss. The number of small intrahepatic
interlobular ducts was greatly reduced. Remain￾ing ducts were compressed by concentrically
arranged fibrous tissue.
Although the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma
was suspected on clinical and radiological
grounds in three patients, histological confirma￾tion by fine needle aspiration cytology was
possible only in one patient. A second patient
was diagnosed at the time of transplantation by
frozen section. In two patients no evidence of
tumour was found at transplantation, the diag￾nosis being confirmed only on microscopic
examination of the total hepatectomy specimen.
Absence of intra-abdominal spread was con￾firmed at operation before proceeding with
transplantation in patients with cholangiocar￾cinoma.
Three patients had well or moderately differ￾entiated sclerosing cholangiocarcinoma and one
a predominantly intraductal papillary car￾cinoma. The tumour was located in the common
hepatic duct with local invasion into both lobes
of the liver in one patient, the common bile duct
in one patient, common bile duct and right and
left hepatic ducts in one patient, and the
common bile duct, common hepatic duct, and
adjacent liver in the last patient. All patients
showed evidence of extensive intraneural and
perineural spread affecting the cut margin of the
common bile duct in three patients (including
the fourth patient with a small tumour). The
portal vein was microscopically involved in two
patients. No patient had evidence of nodal
spread. All patients had multiple areas of
atypical epithelial hyperplasia (dysplasia) and

OUTCOME
Three of the 11 patients died of sepsis related
complications within the first month of trans￾plantation (two with primary sclerosing
cholangitis only, one with primary sclerosing
cholangitis and cholangiocarcinoma). The
remaining five patients with cholangitis only
(71%) were alive from 4-30 months after trans￾plantation. One patient with cholangiocar￾cinoma died of tumour recurrence 23 months
after transplantation while another patient had
tumour reccurrence at 39 months. The third
patient was tumour free at 14 months.
Discussion
The association of cholangiocarcinoma with
ulcerative colitis has been well documented.'2
Mir-Madjlessi et al'2 calculated a relative risk of
31-3 compared with the general population.
Recent careful histological studies have sug￾gested that this association is the result of
patients with ulcerative colitis initially develop￾ing primary sclerosing cholangitis.'3 Previously,
by definition the diagnosis of primary sclerosing
cholangitis and cholangiocarcinoma were
mutually exclusive. Results of studies, however,
are now documenting the development of
cholangiocarcinoma in patients with well estab￾lished primary sclerosing cholangitis. Chapman
et a13 retrospectively reviewed 29 patients with
primary sclerosing cholangitis. Three of 11
deaths occurred secondary to cholangiocar￾cinoma developing 8-11 years after the diagnosis
of primary sclerosing cholangitis. Of 68 patients
followed up for a mean of 30 months at the Mayo
Clinic, five patients died of cholangiocarcinoma
diagnosed at necropsy.1 Four cases of cholangio￾carcinoma diagnosed at necropsy developed in
45 patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis in
a study by Aadland et al.4 Marsh et al"4 published
the experience of 55 patients with primary
sclerosing cholangitis undergoing orthotopic
liver transplantation at the Pittsburgh centre.
Five patients had evidence of occult cholangio￾carcinoma at transplantation. Our results show
that one third of patients who received a trans￾plant with primary sclerosing cholangitis have
coincidental cholangiocarcinoma.
Cholangiocarcinoma complicating primary
sclerosing cholangitis is often difficult to diag￾nose due to the presence of obstructive symp￾toms and a distorted biliary tree. The only
certain method of diagnosis is histological exami￾nation of the total hepatectomy specimen at
necropsy and more recently after orthotopic liver
transplantation. Despite the similarities in
presentation, we were able to identify success￾fully three of four patients with cholangiocar￾cinoma before transplantation, based on sudden
clinical deterioration (weight loss, jaundice,
pruritus) associated with rapidly rising bilirubin
and alkaline phosphatase concentrations over
one year and appreciably dilated intrahepatic
bile ducts. More sensitive means of diagnosing
cholangiocarcinoma, however, need to be
developed, as one of our patients had no clinical,
laboratory, or radiological features of cholangio￾carcinoma. One promising method seems to be
bile brush cytology. 5 Recent reports have shown
that 30-85% of tumour may be detected by this
method`5 in patients with cholangiocarcinoma
only. Results of studies with primary sclerosing
cholangitis and cholangiocarcinoma are in pro￾gress. Immunohistochemical staining of biliary
epithelium for carcinoembryonic antigen seems
to discriminate between normal and neoplastic
biliary epithelium in our study and others,'617
although the serum concentration is usually not
high. This may be a useful addition to bile duct
epithelial cytology to identify early carcinoma.
The findings of multiple areas of dysplasia and
carcinoma in situ in biliary epithelium at sites
remote from the cholangiocarcinoma in the
hepatectomy specimens suggest that chronic
inflammation found in primary sclerosing
cholangitis may stimulate premalignant change
in epithelium throughout the biliary tree.'8
Detection of biliary epithelial atypia in fine
needle aspirates should suggest either the
presence or the future development of cholangio￾carcinoma.
Histological examination of the hepatectomy
specimen unequivocally showed that all patients
with cholangiocarcinoma had underlying
cholangitis, verifying the previous studies by
Wee et al.'3 Patients with cholangiocarcinoma,
however, tended to present for transplantation
with a less severe stage of cholangitis, suggesting
that the development of the cholangiocarcinoma
precipitated the need for transplantation.
Patients with clinical features of severe end stage
primary sclerosing cholangitis, but fibrosis only
and not cirrhosis on biopsy specimen, should
therefore be carefully screened for complicating
cholangiocarcinoma.
Although the early survival of transplanted
patients with and without cholangiocarcinoma
limited to the bile ducts and liver seems to be no
different, longterm follow up in our study and

that of others'4 1' suggests that the majority will
have tumour recurrence. This is not surprising
in light of the extensive perineural and sub￾mucosal spread of the tumour, usually extending
to the bile duct resection margins. Immuno￾suppressive treatment after transplantation may
potentiate residual tumour growth.
Our policy is to give patients with primary
sclerosing cholangitis with a poor quality of life
and end stage liver disease a transplant. Patients
suspected on clinical and radiological grounds of
developing cholangiocarcinoma are aggressively
investigated both before and during transplanta￾tion for evidence of tumour. Patients with
definite evidence of cholangiocarcinoma are
currently excluded from transplantation due to
inevitable recurrence. In view of the increased
risk of cholangiocarcinoma in patients with
primary sclerosing cholangitis, policies may
need to be modified to give such patients a
transplant at an earlier stage.
