Abstract
We report the case of a 68-year-old male with extension of papil￾lary renal cell carcinoma (Fuhrman grade III) along a percutanous 
biopsy tract detected at the time of partial nephrectomy. Biopsy 
was performed to a obtain tissue diagnosis of a complex renal 
cyst as the patient was unable to receive intravenous contrast for 
imaging due to a severe allergy. Although biopsy of indeterminate 
renal lesions can provide valuable diagnostic information, there are 
inherent risks associated with this procedure. The rare occurrence 
of tumour seeding should be considered when recommending per￾cutaneous biopsy to a patient with a renal mass.
Introduction 
An estimated 60 920 new cases of renal cell carcinoma 
(RCC) will be diagnosed in the United States in 2011.1
 With 
the increased use of cross-sectional imaging, many of these 
masses are diagnosed at an early stage in asymptomatic 
patients.2
 This “stage migration” has led to increased use 
of active surveillance to manage small renal masses. It has 
recently been suggested that percutaneous biopsy plays a 
key role in the management algorithm for these patients.3,4
Although generally safe, percutaneous biopsy has not expe￾rienced widespread acceptance in part due to conflicting 
reports regarding its diagnostic accuracy.5-7 We report a 
rare complication occurring after percutaneous biopsy of 
a renal mass that should be considered before proceeding 
with diagnostic renal mass biopsy.
Case report 
A 68-year-old male was referred to our urology clinic after 
incidental discovery of a left renal cyst. The renal abnor￾mality was first documented on imaging obtained during 
follow-up of an asymptomatic right common iliac artery 
aneurysm. Computed tomography (CT) scan with intrave￾nous contrast demonstrated a 4.2-cm left renal cyst with 
mural calcifications consistent with a Bosniak class IIF cyst. 
Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed 
the diagnosis. Unfortunately, the patient suffered a severe 
allergic reaction to iodinated in the past precluding him 
from receiving further intravenous contrast for CT or MRI. 
At this time biannual surveillance of the renal lesion was 
recommended. Subsequent non-contrast CT scans obtained 
at 6 and 12 months after initial presentation demonstrated 
a stable left renal cyst with no change in size or imaging 
characteristics. 
Eighteen months after initial presentation a non-contrast 
CT scan demonstrated significant changes in the renal lesion. 
Specifically, there was a 5-mm increase in cyst diameter as 
well as a significant increase in CT attenuation consistent 
with a recent hemorrhage. These findings were concerning 
for malignancy (Fig. 1). Given these worrisome findings the 
patient was pre-medicated with prednisone in preparation 
for MRI with gadolinium. However, despite these precau￾tionary measures, the patient was still unable to receive an 
appropriate imaging study. Given the significant limitations 
to imaging the patient with intravenous contrast, the deci￾sion was made to proceed with ultrasound guided biopsy 
of the renal lesion.
The patient was taken to the biopsy suite and under￾went successful ultrasound-guided biopsy of the renal 
mass. During the procedure, fine needle aspiration of the 
left renal cyst was performed with 4 passes of a 22-gauge 
Chiba needle. Additionally, 2 core biopsies were performed 
with a 20-gauge core biopsy device. Notably, no coaxial 
sheath was used during the biopsy procedure. Specimens 
were sent to cytopathology for analysis. Pathologic review 
was consistent with Fuhrman grade I papillary RCC. Given 
these results, the patient was taken to the operating room 
and underwent an uneventful open partial nephrectomy 2 
months after percutaneous biopsy. Pathologic analysis by a 
dedicated genitourinary pathologist demonstrated a 6.5-cm 
Fuhrman grade III papillary RCC invading the perirenal fat 
within the previous biopsy tract (Fig. 2a, Fig. 2b). Extrarenal

tumour extension was isolated to the area within the biopsy 
tract. No perirenal extension was noted around or through 
the biopsy tract suggesting biopsy tract seeding as the mech￾anism for the extrarenal disease. All surgical margins were 
negative and the final pathologic stage was pT3aNxMx (as 
per the American Joint Committee on Cancer, 2009). The 
patient’s postoperative course was uneventful, and he was 
discharged on postoperative day 5. There has been no recur￾rence of his disease at the 3-month follow-up.
Discussion 
RCC extension along a percutaneous biopsy tract is extreme￾ly rare with no documented cases in the past 20 years. We 
report a case of high-grade papillary RCC extending along 
a percutaneous biopsy tract detected on pathologic review 
of the partial nephrectomy specimen. At our institution, 
renal biopsy is not routinely used in the management of a 
renal mass suspicious for RCC. In the past year <25 patients 
have been referred for ultrasound-guided percutaneous renal 
mass biopsy. However, renal biopsy via a coaxial sheath is 
routinely performed at the time of CT-guided, percutane￾ous renal cryoablation. About 50 of these procedures were 
performed at our institution in the past year. 
In the present case, renal biopsy was performed to obtain 
tissue diagnosis in a patient whose severe contrast allergy 
precluded him from receiving intravenous contrast for either 
CT or MRI. As has been previously reported, the biopsy 
specimen in the present case significantly underestimated 
the tumour’s nuclear grade leading to a delay in the timing 
of partial nephrectomy.7
 Fortunately, the patient’s disease 
was completely resected and there was no evidence of recur￾rence with short-term follow-up. The present report should 
not discourage use of image-guided percutaneous biopsy of 
renal tumours in select cases. Rather, it should serve to raise 
awareness of this rare complication, and to limit its use in 
cases where it will not directly affect patient management. 
In 1977 Gibbons and colleagues reported the first case of 
RCC tumour implantation 20 months after needle (18-gauge) 
aspiration of a renal mass.8
 Since that time there have been 
5 reports of implantation of RCC in percutaneous biopsy 
tracts. These cases occurred from 24 days to 84 months 
after the initial biopsy with needles ranging in size from 
14 to 23-gauge.9-13 More recently, there have been several 
percutaneous biopsy series that have reported no cases of 
tumour implantation.7,14-19 In fact, in a review of the role 
of percutaneous biopsy in evaluating renal masses, Herts 
and Baker estimated the risk of tumour seeding at 0.01%.20
Of note, biopsies in these series were performed using a 
coaxial sheath, which has been recommended as the stan￾dard technique for renal mass biopsy.21 Although the risk of 
adverse oncologic outcomes after percutaneous biopsy has 
been minimized by modern biopsy techniques, the current 
report demonstrates that some risk still exists.
Although the risk of biopsy tract seeding with RCC is very 
low, the same cannot be said for upper tract transitional cell 
carcinoma (TCC). There have been multiple reports of TCC 
seeding after renal mass biopsy, nephrostomy tube place￾ment for obstructive uropathy, and percutaneous manage￾ment of upper tract TCC.9,22-24 It is generally considered that 
these tumours have a higher propensity to implant after 
percutaneous manipulation than RCC. This risk should be 
considered when deciding whether to subject a patient to 
percutaneous renal biopsy. 
The occurrence of biopsy tract seeding has been well￾documented in several solid, non-urologic malignancies, 
including hepatocellular carcinoma, lung and pancreas ade￾nocarcinoma.25 Extrapolating from the hepatocellular carci￾noma literature, several technical considerations at the time 
of percutaneous biopsy can nearly eliminate the risk of RCC 
implantation. Specifically, large gauge needles, increased 
number of needle passes into the mass, end-cutting needles, 
and lack of a biopsy sheath have been implicated in tumour 
seeding of biopsy tracts.21,25,26 In the present case the techni￾cal risk factors were the 6 needle passes into the mass and 
lack of a biopsy sheath. Although multiple needle passes 
were necessary to obtain a histological diagnosis, the use 
of a sheath may have decreased the risk of tumour seeding.

biopsy of renal masses, Volpe and colleagues recommended 
the use of a coaxial sheath to minimize exposure of tumour 
cells to surrounding tissues.21 In fact, recent large biopsy 
series using a coaxial sheath describe no reported cases of 
biopsy tract seeding.7,17-19 The outcomes experienced by this 
patient highlight the potential risks and benefits associated 
with percutaneous biopsy of renal masses. However, techni￾cal considerations at the time of biopsy, including the use 
of a coaxial sheath, may nearly eliminate the risk of RCC 
seeding a biopsy tract.
Conclusion
We present the only contemporary report of RCC seeding a 
percutaneous biopsy tract. This report should not discourage 
the use of percutaneous biopsy of renal masses, but rather 
raise awareness of this exceedingly uncommon complica￾tion and the steps that can be taken to minimize the risk 
at the time of biopsy. Specifically, use of a coaxial biopsy 
sheath has nearly eliminated the risk of biopsy tract seeding 
after renal mass biopsy. The use of percutaneous biopsy of 
renal masses should be reserved for situations where obtain￾ing a tissue diagnosis will directly impact patient care.
