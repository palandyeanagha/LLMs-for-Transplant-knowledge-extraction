Practices for Use of Hepatitis A Vaccine for Postexposure Prophylaxis and for 
Preexposure Prophylaxis for International Travel

Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) with hepatitis A (HepA) 
vaccine or immune globulin (IG) effectively prevents infec￾tion with hepatitis A virus (HAV) when administered within 
2 weeks of exposure. Preexposure prophylaxis against HAV 
infection through the administration of HepA vaccine or IG 
provides protection for unvaccinated persons traveling to or 
working in countries that have high or intermediate HAV 
endemicity. The Advisory Committee on Immunization 
Practices (ACIP) Hepatitis Vaccines Work Group conducted a 
systematic review of the evidence for administering vaccine for 
PEP to persons aged >40 years and reviewed the HepA vaccine 
efficacy and safety in infants and the benefits of protection 
against HAV before international travel. The February 21, 
2018, ACIP recommendations update and supersede previ￾ous ACIP recommendations for HepA vaccine for PEP and 
for international travel. Current recommendations include 
that HepA vaccine should be administered to all persons 
aged ≥12 months for PEP. In addition to HepA vaccine, IG 
may be administered to persons aged >40 years depending on 
the provider’s risk assessment. ACIP also recommended that 
HepA vaccine be administered to infants aged 6–11 months 
traveling outside the United States when protection against 
HAV is recommended. The travel-related dose for infants aged 
6–11 months should not be counted toward the routine 2-dose 
series. The dosage of IG has been updated where applicable 
(0.1 mL/kg). HepA vaccine for PEP provides advantages over 
IG, including induction of active immunity, longer duration 
of protection, ease of administration, and greater acceptability 
and availability.
Introduction
Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) with hepatitis A (HepA) 
vaccine or immune globulin (IG) effectively prevents infec￾tion with hepatitis A virus (HAV) when administered within 
2 weeks of exposure (1,2). The efficacy of IG or vaccine when 
administered >2 weeks after exposure has not been established. 
Previous ACIP* recommendations for PEP included HepA vac￾cine for persons aged 1–40 years and IG for persons outside this 
age range; if IG was not available for persons aged >40 years, 
HepA vaccine could be administered (1).
Preexposure prophylaxis against HAV infection through the 
administration of HepA vaccine or IG is also recommended 
for unvaccinated persons traveling to or working in countries 
that have high or intermediate HAV endemicity (3). Because 
HepA vaccine is not licensed for use in children aged <1 year, 
IG has historically been recommended for travelers in this age 
group; however, IG cannot be administered simultaneously 
with measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, which is 
also recommended for infants aged 6–11 months traveling 
internationally from the United States (4–6).
This report provides recommendations for PEP use of HepA 
vaccine and IG, and use of HepA vaccine and IG for preexpo￾sure protection for persons who will be traveling internation￾ally, including infants aged 6–11 months. This report updates 
and supersedes previous ACIP recommendations for HepA 
vaccine for PEP and for international travel (1).
Methods
During November 2016–February 2018, the ACIP Hepatitis 
Work Group† held monthly conference calls to review and 
*Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in children, adolescents, and
adults are developed by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
(ACIP). ACIP is chartered as a federal advisory committee to provide expert
external advice and guidance to the Director of CDC on use of vaccines and
related agents for the control of vaccine-preventable diseases in the civilian U.S. 
population. Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in children and
adolescents are harmonized to the greatest extent possible with recommendations 
made by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Academy
of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists (ACOG). Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in adults 
are harmonized with the recommendations of AAFP, ACOG, and the American 
College of Physicians (ACP). ACIP recommendations approved by the CDC
Director become agency guidelines on the date published in the Morbidity and 
Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip. †The ACIP Hepatitis Vaccines Work Group comprises professionals from
academic medicine (family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics, 
infectious disease, occupational health, and preventive medicine specialists),
federal and state public health entities, and medical societies.

discuss relevant scientific evidence,§ including the use of HepA 
vaccine and IG for PEP and the use of HepA vaccine for infants 
before some international travel. The ACIP Hepatitis Work 
Group evaluated the quality of evidence related to the benefits 
and harms of administering a dose of HepA vaccine for PEP for 
persons aged >40 years using the Grading of Recommendations 
Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) frame￾work (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/recs/grade/table-refs.
html). Quality of evidence related to the benefits and harms 
of administering HepA vaccine for preexposure prophylaxis to 
infants aged 6–11 months who will be traveling internation￾ally was not evaluated using the GRADE framework; instead, 
studies of HepA vaccine efficacy and safety in infants (7–9) 
and the benefits of protection against HAV before international 
travel were considered (3).
At the February 2018 ACIP meeting, the following proposed 
recommendations were presented to the committee: 1) HepA 
vaccines should be administered for PEP for all persons aged 
≥12 months; in addition to HepA vaccine, IG may be admin￾istered to persons aged >40 years for PEP, depending on the 
provider’s risk assessment; and 2) HepA vaccine should be 
administered to infants aged 6–11 months traveling outside 
the United States when protection against hepatitis A is recom￾mended. After a period for public comment, the recommenda￾tions were approved unanimously by the voting ACIP members.¶
Summary of Key Findings
Prevention of HAV infection with HepA vaccine following 
exposure. A randomized, double-blind clinical trial of HepA 
vaccine in 1,090 HAV-susceptible persons aged 2–40 years 
who were contacts of persons with HAV infection suggested 
that performance of HepA vaccine administered <14 days after 
exposure approaches that of IG in healthy children and adults 
aged <40 years (1,10). Limited data are available comparing 
HepA vaccine and IG in healthy adults aged >40 years; avail￾able data indicate reduced response to HepA vaccine in older 
age groups compared with response in younger adults (11).
§ In preparation for ACIP deliberation, the scientific literature was searched using 
PubMed and EMBASE databases for reports published from January 1, 1992, 
through January 7, 2017. Search terms included “hepatitis A vaccine” and
“HAV vaccine” and excluded studies in nonhumans and articles on children
and adolescents. To qualify as a candidate for inclusion in the review, a study
had to include data within 2 weeks of the first dose of HepA vaccine. Studies
were excluded if they reported data focused solely on children, did not provide 
information on ages of persons studied, did not include data on Havrix or Vaqta 
(the two single antigen HepA vaccines currently licensed in the United States), 
only included safety data or discussed vaccine introduction without providing 
new data on vaccine efficacy or seroprotection, or only reported data on persons 
with underlying health conditions.
¶ 14 voted in favor, with none opposed, none abstained, and none recused.
GRADE quality of evidence summary for HepA vaccine 
for PEP in persons aged >40 years. The evidence assessing 
benefits and harms of administering a dose of HepA vaccine 
for PEP to prevent HAV infection in adults aged >40 years 
was determined to be GRADE evidence type 4 (i.e., evidence 
from clinical experience and observations, observational stud￾ies with important limitations, or randomized controlled trials 
with several major limitations) for benefits and type 3 (i.e., 
evidence from observational studies, or randomized controlled 
trials with notable limitations) for harms (https://www.cdc.
gov/vaccines/acip/recs/grade/table-refs.html).
Prevention of HAV infection among infants aged 
6–11 months who received HepA vaccine before travel.
HepA vaccine was demonstrated to be safe and efficacious for 
infants as young as age 2 months (2,7–9), although vaccina￾tion of infants aged <12 months might result in a suboptimal 
immune response because of potential interference with 
passively acquired maternal antibody, which could decrease 
long-term immunity (7–9).
Rationale for Recommendations
Advantages of HepA vaccine for PEP. HepA vaccine for 
PEP provides numerous public health advantages compared 
with IG, including the induction of active immunity and lon￾ger duration of protection, ease of administration, and greater 
acceptability and availability (11). Previous recommendations 
favoring IG for adults aged >40 years were based on the premise 
that IG is more efficacious in this group; however, evidence 
of decreased IG potency (i.e., reduced titers of anti-HAV 
antibodies) (12) led to a recommendation for an increase in 
the IG dosage (0.1 mL/kg) for hepatitis A PEP in 2017, with 
a consequent increase in IG administration volume (6). In 
addition, when HAV exposure, and thus the need for PEP, is 
not clear (i.e., consumer of recalled food product or patron at 
a restaurant where a notification occurred), the benefit of IG 
compared with vaccine, which provides long-term protection, 
is less certain.
Before travel administration of HepA vaccine to infants 
aged 6–11 months. IG cannot be administered simultaneously 
with MMR vaccine because antibody-containing products 
such as IG can inhibit the immune response to measles and 
rubella vaccines for 3 months (4,6). However, because MMR 
vaccine is recommended for all infants aged 6–11 months 
traveling internationally from the United States and because 
measles in infancy is more severe than HAV infection in 
infancy, MMR vaccine should be administered preferentially 
to preexposure prophylaxis with IG for prevention of HAV 

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 
1218 MMWR / November 2, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 43 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
infection. Administration of HepA vaccine (indication for 
off-label use) and MMR vaccine to infants aged 6–11 months 
(7–9) provides protection against both HAV and measles and 
allows for simultaneous prophylactic administration (4,13).
Recommendations for Postexposure Prophylaxis 
Against HAV Infection
HepA vaccine should be administered to all persons aged 
≥12 months for PEP. In addition to HepA vaccine, IG may be 
administered to persons aged >40 years, depending on the pro￾vider’s risk assessment (Supplementary Text 1, https://staging￾stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/59777). Recommendations for PEP 
have been updated to include HepA vaccine for all unvacci￾nated persons aged ≥12 months, regardless of risk group, and 
co-administration of IG when indicated (Table 1). The dosage 
of GamaSTAN S/D human IG for PEP (0.1 mL/kg) also has 
been updated (6). Persons who have recently been exposed 
to HAV and who have not received HepA vaccine previously 
should receive PEP as soon as possible, within 2 weeks of 
exposure (1).
Infants aged <12 months and persons for whom vaccine 
is contraindicated. Infants aged <12 months and persons for 
whom vaccine is contraindicated (persons who have had a life￾threatening allergic reaction after a dose of HepA vaccine, or 
who have a severe allergy to any component of this vaccine) 
should receive IG (0.1 mL/kg) (6,14) instead of HepA vaccine, 
as soon as possible and within 2 weeks of exposure. MMR 
and varicella vaccines should not be administered sooner than 
3 months after IG administration (4–6).
Immunocompetent persons aged ≥12 months. Persons 
aged ≥12 months who have been exposed to HAV within the 
past 14 days and have not previously completed the 2-dose 
HepA vaccine series should receive a single dose of HepA vac￾cine (Table 2) as soon as possible. In addition to HepA vaccine, 
IG (0.1 mL/kg) may be administered to persons aged >40 years 
depending on the providers’ risk assessment (Supplementary 
Text 1, https://staging-stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/59777). For 
long-term immunity, the HepA vaccine series should be com￾pleted with a second dose at least 6 months after the first dose; 
however, the second dose is not necessary for PEP. A second 
dose should not be administered any sooner than 6 months 
after the first dose, regardless of HAV exposure risk.
Persons aged ≥12 months who are immunocompromised 
or have chronic liver disease. Persons who are immunocom￾promised or have chronic liver disease and who have been 
exposed to HAV within the past 14 days and have not previ￾ously completed the 2-dose HepA vaccination series should 
receive both IG (0.1 mL/kg) and HepA vaccine simultaneously 
in a different anatomic site (e.g., separate limbs) as soon as

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) with hepatitis A (HepA) vaccine 
or immune globulin (IG) prevents infection with hepatitis A 
virus when administered within 2 weeks of exposure. Measles, 
mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) is recommended for infants 
aged 6–11 months traveling outside the United States. IG 
cannot be administered simultaneously with MMR.
What is added by this report?
HepA vaccine is recommended for persons aged ≥12 months for 
PEP. Providers may also administer IG to adults aged >40 years, if 
indicated. The dosage of IG has been updated. Simultaneous 
administration of MMR and HepA vaccines is recommended for 
infants aged 6–11 months traveling internationally.
What are the implications for public health practice?
HepA vaccine for PEP provides advantages over IG, including 
induction of active immunity, longer duration of protection, ease 
of administration, and greater acceptability and availability.
(Table 1). The travel-related dose for infants aged 6–11 months 
should not be counted toward the routine 2-dose series. 
Therefore, the 2-dose HepA vaccination series should be initi￾ated at age 12 months according to the routine, age-appropriate 
vaccination schedule.
Recommendations for preexposure protection against HAV 
for travelers aged <6 months and aged ≥12 months remain 
unchanged from previous recommendations (Table 1), except 
for the updated dosage of IG where applicable (Supplementary 
Text 2, https://staging-stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/59778) (6). 
For travel duration up to 1 month, 0.1 mL/kg of IG is recom￾mended; for travel up to 2 months, the dose is 0.2 mL/kg, 
and for travel of ≥2 months, a 0.2 mL/kg dose should be 
repeated every 2 months for the duration of travel. All sus￾ceptible persons traveling to or working in countries that have 
high or intermediate HAV endemicity are at increased risk 
for infection and should be vaccinated or receive IG before 
departure (1,3).

Recommendations for Preexposure Protection 
Against HAV Infection for Travelers
Infants aged 6–11 months. HepA vaccine should be 
administered to infants aged 6–11 months traveling outside the 
United States when protection against HAV is recommended 

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 
1220 MMWR / November 2, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 43 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Infants aged <6 months and travelers who elect not to 
receive vaccine or for whom vaccine is contraindicated.
Infants aged <6 months and travelers who elect not to receive 
vaccine or for whom vaccine is contraindicated should receive 
a single dose of IG before travel when protection against HAV 
is recommended. If travel is for ≥2 months’ duration, a repeat 
dose of 0.2 mL/kg every 2 months should be administered (6).
Healthy persons aged 12 months–40 years. Healthy per￾sons aged 12 months–40 years who are planning travel to an 
area with high or intermediate HAV endemicity and have not 
received HepA vaccine should receive a single dose of HepA 
vaccine as soon as travel is considered and should complete the 
2-does series according to the routine schedule.
Persons aged >40 years, immunocompromised persons, 
and persons with chronic liver disease. Persons with chronic 
liver disease as well as adults aged >40 years, immunocompro￾mised persons, and persons with other chronic medical condi￾tions planning to depart to an area with high or intermediate 
HAV endemicity in <2 weeks should receive the initial dose of 
HepA vaccine, and also simultaneously may be administered 
IG at a separate anatomic injection site (e.g., separate limbs) 
(Table 1) (6,15–17).
In addition to HepA vaccine, IG should be considered before 
travel for persons with special risk factors for either HAV 
infection or increased risk for complications in the event of 
an exposure to HAV (Table 3) (Supplementary Text 2, https://
staging-stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/59778).
