Abstract
Introduction: Critically ill cirrhosis patients awaiting liver transplantation (LT) often receive prioritization for organ
allocation. Identification of patients most likely to benefit is essential. The purpose of this study was to examine
whether the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score can predict 90-day mortality in critically ill
recipients of LT and whether it can predict receipt of LT among critically ill cirrhosis listed awaiting LT.
Methods: We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study consisting of two datasets: (a) all critically-ill
cirrhosis patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission before LT at five transplant centers in Canada from
2000 through 2009 (one site, 1990 through 2009), and (b) critically ill cirrhosis patients receiving LT from ICU
(n = 115) and those listed but not receiving LT before death (n = 106) from two centers where complete data
were available.
Results: In the first dataset, 198 critically ill cirrhosis patients receiving LT (mean (SD) age 53 (10) years, 66% male,
median (IQR) model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) 34 (26-39)) were included. Mean (SD) SOFA scores at ICU
admission, at 48 hours, and at LT were 12.5 (4), 13.0 (5), and 14.0 (4). Survival at 90 days was 84% (n = 166). In
multivariable analysis, only older age was independently associated with reduced 90-day survival (odds ratio (OR),
1.07; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.14; P = 0.013). SOFA score did not predict 90-day mortality at any time. In the second
dataset, 47.9% (n = 106) of cirrhosis patients listed for LT died in the ICU waiting for LT. In multivariable analysis,
higher SOFA at 48 hours after admission was independently associated with lower probability of receiving LT
(OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.82 to 0.97; P = 0.006). When including serum lactate and SOFA at 48 hours in the final model,
elevated lactate (at 48 hours) was also significantly associated with lower likelihood of receiving LT (0.32; 0.17
to 0.61; P = 0.001).
Conclusions: SOFA appears poor at predicting 90-day survival in critically ill cirrhosis patients after LT, but higher
SOFA score and elevated lactate 48 hours after ICU admission are associated with a lower probability receiving LT.
Older critically ill cirrhosis patients (older than 60) receiving LT have worse 90-day survival and should be
considered for LT with caution.
Introduction
Liver transplantation (LT) for established cirrhosis is
associated with good outcomes, reaching survival of
greater than 80% at 1 year [1]. However, given the
increasing waiting times for LT, some patients deterio￾rate, precipitating admission to the intensive care unit
(ICU) [2]. Given the scarcity of organs and costs of pro￾longed ICU support, being able to discriminate those
cirrhosis patients who will maximally benefit from LT
after ICU admission would be useful. Therefore, objec￾tive measures to score risk of death and major morbidity
based on accessible physiological and laboratory values
would be useful to guide clinical decision making for
liver organ allocation and transplantation among
decompensated cirrhosis patients receiving support in a
critical care setting [3].

Liver-specific scoring systems, such as the Child-Turcotte
Pugh (CTP) score and the Model for End-stage Liver
Disease (MELD), seem optimal for prognostication in
slowly decompensating cirrhosis patients but may not
perform as well in those with additional organ dysfunc￾tion. The CTP score, validated in cirrhosis patients
undergoing surgical esophageal varix ligation/TIPS,
includes synthetic hepatic markers (INR, bilirubin, albu￾min) and complications specific to cirrhosis (ascites and
encephalopathy) but does not take into account cardiac,
pulmonary, and/or kidney dysfunction (that is, non-liver
organ dysfunction) [3-6]. MELD is currently used for
organ allocation in North America and has been vali￾dated for 3-month survival in cirrhosis patients (all
etiologies) without transplant, but its ability to prognos￾ticate outcome with transplant in critically ill cirrhosis
patients has not been rigorously evaluated [7,8].
Illness severity scores such as the Acute Physiology
and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score (see
operational definitions) or the Sequential Organ Failure
Assessment (SOFA) could potentially offer superior
prognostication in the setting of extrahepatic organ dys￾function. APACHE II correlates with hospital outcome
in a mixed ICU population and in nontransplanted cir￾rhosis patients; however, it has been validated for use
only at the time of ICU admission [9,10]. SOFA is a
validated ICU-specific organ-dysfunction score, devel￾oped in a heterogeneous critically ill septic population,
and correlates with outcome [10,11]. The SOFA score,
calculated as a composite of gradations in severity of
organ dysfunction across six organ systems (neurologic,
respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, hematologic, and
hepatic), can be calculated daily to assess evolution of
organ dysfunction [11]. Prior studies showed that SOFA
scores above 11 correspond to hospital mortality
exceeding 80% in a heterogeneous ICU population [12].
To date; however, the clinical utility of the SOFA score
to predict outcomes in critically ill cirrhosis patients has
been evaluated only in patients that did not receive LT
[13-16].
We hypothesized that increased severity of organ dys￾function, as defined by the SOFA score, would adversely
affect 90-day survival and reduce the proportion of
listed eligible critically ill cirrhosis patients receiving LT.
Accordingly, our objectives were:
1. To determine whether critically ill cirrhosis patients
with a high burden of organ dysfunction, as defined by
the SOFA score, measured at the time of ICU admis￾sion, at 48 hours after admission, and on the day of
LT, have a higher 90-day mortality compared with
those with less-severe organ dysfunction.
2. To determine whether critically ill cirrhosis patients
with a high burden of organ dysfunction, as defined by
the SOFA score, measured at the time of ICU admis￾sion and at 48 hours after admission, who are eligible
for LT, are less likely to receive LT compared with
those with less-severe organ dysfunction.
Materials and methods
The reporting of this study follows the STROBE state￾ment for observational studies [17]. The Health Research
Ethics Boards at each participating institution approved
this study before commencement. The requirement for
individual informed consent was waived.
Design and setting
For our first objective, we performed a retrospective
cohort study of all critically ill cirrhosis patients trans￾planted (n = 198) at five major Canadian liver transplant
centers (University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta; Uni￾versity of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia;
McGill University, Montreal, Quebec; University of Tor￾onto, Toronto, Ontario; and Western University, London,
Ontario) between January 2000 and December 2009.
Data were collected from the University of Alberta for all
cirrhosis patients given transplants between January 1990
and December 2009.
For our second objective, we performed a retrospective
cohort study from two LT centers (University of Alberta,
Edmonton, from January 1990 through December 2009;
McGill University, Montreal, from January 2000 through
December 2009) where complete data were available on
all critically ill cirrhosis patients who received an LT while
in the ICU (n = 115) and from those eligible cirrhosis
patients listed for LT but who did not receive an LT and
died while in the ICU (n = 106). Data from the other three
centers on eligible critically ill cirrhosis patients listed but
who did not receive LT while in the ICU were unavailable.
Participants
Inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) prior diagnosis of
cirrhosis AND listed for LT; (b) age ≥18 years; and (c)
admission to an ICU with critical illness/organ failures.
Exclusion criteria were as follows: (a) primary diagnosis
of acute (fulminant) liver failure; and (b) liver transplan￾tation from the ward or home; (c) patients receiving
retransplant; and (d) multiorgan transplant (for example,
liver and kidney).
Operational definitions
The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score
is an organ-failure scoring system comprising six organ￾system domains (neurologic, respiratory, cardiovascular,
renal, hematologic, and hepatic) [11]. Each organ system
earns a score out of 4 (range, 0 to 4, with 4 being the
worst) and with a maximum score out of 24. The Acute
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II

Score is a illness-severity classification system based on
initial values of 12 routine physiologic measurements,
age, and previous health status to provide a general
measure of severity of disease. An increasing score
(range, 0 to 71) correlates with increasing risk of hospi￾tal death [10]. The Charlson co-morbidity index (CCI) is
a validated summary measure of premorbid chronic dis￾ease that correlates with 1-year mortality. The CCI com￾prises 22 different chronic conditions. Each condition is
assigned a score (range, 1, 2, 3, or 6, depending on the
severity and the risk of dying associated with this condi￾tion) and added to provide a composite score [18]. We
used a modified version of this by excluding liver dis￾ease. The Donor Risk Index (DRI) is a composite score
of donor variables derived from 9,882 deceased LT
donors (April 1, 2002 to December 31, 2003) from the
Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) data￾base [19]. Given limited donor information from chart
review, we used a modified composite score of variables
that were available and based on the DRI (donor age
>60, partial/split-liver graft, cold ischemia time >8
hours, stroke/cerebrovascular accident as principal
donor cause of death (either ischemic or hemorrhagic)).
Variables
Our primary exposure of interest was severity of organ
dysfunction, as defined by the SOFA score, sequentially
assessed after ICU admission [11]. For the LT cohort
(objective 1; n = 198), the SOFA score was assessed at
ICU admission, at 48 hours after admission, and on the
day of LT. For the eligible but non-LT cohort (objective
2; n = 106), the SOFA score was assessed at ICU admis￾sion and at 48 hours after admission.
Data sources and collection
Data were extracted from patient medical records and
existing regional liver-transplant databases. Data fields
abstracted included the etiology and complications of cir￾rhosis, preoperative (admission, 48 hours, day of trans￾plant, if applicable) hematologic, biochemical and
physiological/organ-dysfunction data (requirement for
vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, renal replacement
therapy (RRT)), donor information, and outcomes after
LT (see Table 1). Data were collected on medical comor￾bidities (modified CCI) when available. Patient outcomes
collected included surgical complications of transplant,
duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of ICU/hos￾pital stay, need for postoperative RRT, and mortality.
Statistical analysis
First objective: predictors of 90-day mortality after liver
transplant (five sites)
For our first objective, our primary outcome was 90-day
mortality among critically ill cirrhosis patients receiving LT.
The rationale for ascertainment of mortality at 90 days
was largely to reflect the early perioperative contributing
factors (severity of illness, donor characteristics) and to
avoid later confounding due to recurrent diseases, such
as recurrent hepatitis C virus (HCV) or graft loss due to
noncompliance with immunosuppression. The main
covariates examined included age, sex, liver-disease
etiology, time of listing to and time from ICU admission
to LT, decade of transplant, and graft/donor risk.
In the event of missing values, data were not replaced
or estimated. After normality testing of descriptive statis￾tics, normally distributed variables were reported as
means with standard deviations (SDs) and compared
with the Student t test. Nonnormally distributed continu￾ous data were reported as medians with interquartile
ranges (IQRs) and compared with the Wilcoxon rank￾sum test. Categoric events were compared by using the
c2 test or the Fisher Exact test where appropriate (n < 5
events). A P value of <0.05 was be considered statistically
significant for all comparisons. Analysis was performed
by using IBM SPSS Version 19 (IBM, New York, USA).
A logistic regression analysis was performed on the
cohort of 198 subjects to determine whether the prob￾ability of 90-day mortality was affected by SOFA in
three separate models (at admission, at 48 hours, and at
day of LT). Covariates included in the model were based
on univariate unadjusted odds ratios (P < 0.1) and pre￾defined covariates; age, sex (female), etiology of liver dis￾ease, decade of LT, and transplant site. Etiology was
collapsed into hepatitis C (HCV) versus other, because
of the less-favorable outcomes associated with HCV
[20]. To account for changes in ICU/transplant practice,
time (decade) was collapsed into a binary variable 1990
through 1999 versus 2000 through 2009, as one site
(University of Alberta) had data from 20 years. Covari￾ates in each model were assessed for collinearity. The
individual parameters included in SOFA were not
included in derivation of these models. Multivariate
associations are reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95%
confidence limits. All presented models met criteria for
fit were assessed by the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness￾of-fit test (P > 0.3 for all).
Second objective: predictors of transplant in 221 critically ill
cirrhosis patients (two sites)
For our second objective, physiological data, biochemical
data, and SOFA were compared (admission, 48 hours)
between all cirrhosis patients transplanted from ICU and
those cirrhosis patients listed for LT but who died in the
ICU awaiting an organ. The primary outcome was receipt
of transplant. Univariable analysis was performed as
described as for the first aim.
We subsequently performed a multivariable logistic
regression analysis exploring predictors of receipt of LT.
Covariates and multivariate associations were reported

regression (P value of <0.10), lactate was included with
predefined covariates. Lactate (admission at 48 hours)
was transformed into its natural logarithm to meet the
assumption of a normal distribution.
Results
First objective: predictors of mortality in transplanted
critically ill cirrhosis patients
Participants and descriptive data
In total, 198 critically ill cirrhosis patients (mean (SD)
age, 53 (10) years, 66% male) received transplants during
the study period. Baseline characteristics are shown in
Table 1. The most common etiologies were hepatitis C
(31%) and alcohol abuse (15%). LT occurred a median
(IQR) of 29 (5 to 101) days from listing and 5 (3 to 10)
days from ICU admission. While in the ICU, 88% received
vasopressors, 56% received RRT, and 87% were mechani￾cally ventilated before LT. The median (IQR) MELD score
was 34 (26 to 39) on ICU admission and 34 (27 to 40) on
the day of LT, respectively. SOFA scores (mean (SD))
were 12.5 (4), 13 (5), and 14 (4) on ICU admission, at 48
hours, and on the day of LT, respectively.
Overall, 166 (84%) of all 198 transplanted critically ill
cirrhosis patients were alive at 90 days, 145 (74%) of
197 at 1 year, and 105 (62.5%) of 163 at 3 years. Sixteen
(8%) patients were given repeated transplants. Donor
characteristics are also shown in Table 1. Thirty-five
(18%) of 193 patients received a graft from a donor aged
>60 years, 1% received a split graft, 54% of donors died
of a cerebrovascular accident (ischemic or hemorrhagic),
and 56% of donor organs were transplanted with a cold￾ischemia time exceeding 8 hours.
Univariable outcome data: 198 liver transplant recipients
Results of univariable analysis are shown in Table 2.
Comparing patients who were alive (n = 166, 84%) with
those who were dead (n = 32, 16%) at 90 days, no statis￾tically significant differences in MELD were found on
admission or day of LT (P > 0.6 for both). No statisti￾cally significant differences were seen between SOFA on
admission or day of LT (P > 0.17 for both). Patients
alive at 90 days were significantly younger (51 versus 56
years; P = 0.007). Patients older than 60 years had sig￾nificantly higher 90-day mortality (27% versus 13%; P =
0.04), and a trend toward increased 1-year mortality
(37% versus 23%; P = 0.09). No significant differences in
donor characteristics were noted comparing LT recipi￾ents alive at 90 days with nonsurvivors. The primary
cause of death in patients deceased <90 days was sepsis/
multiorgan failure (n = 7, 54% where data were
available).
Multivariable analysis: predictors of mortality
Three separate multivariable logistic regression models
were built to assess the impact of the exposure SOFA
on admission (model 1), SOFA 48 hours after ICU
admission (model 2), and SOFA on the day of LT
(model 3) and survival (Table 3). After covariate adjust￾ment, SOFA was not significantly predictive of 90-day
mortality when assessed at ICU admission, at 48 hours,
or on the day of LT (P > 0.2 for all). In all three models,
age (per incremental year) was independently associated
with higher 90-day mortality in all models (P < 0.03 for
all models) after controlling for SOFA, sex, etiology,
decade of transplant, and transplant center.
Second objective: predictors of transplant in 221 critically
ill cirrhosis patients (two sites)
Participants and descriptive data
Baseline data of 106 nontransplanted cirrhosis patients
are shown in Table 1. The most common etiologies
were hepatitis C (29%) and alcohol abuse (23%). In total,
78% required vasopressors, 55% received RRT, and 82%
were mechanically ventilated while in the ICU. The
median (IQR) MELD score was 36 (27 to 40) on ICU
admission. Mean (SD) SOFA scores were 14 (4) and 17
(4) on ICU admission and at 48 hours, respectively.

Univariable analysis: Liver transplant in 221 critically ill
cirrhotics (two sites)
Patients who died waiting for LT had higher MELD
scores on admission (36 versus 33, P = 0.035; see Addi￾tional file 1). Furthermore, SOFA on admission (14 ver￾sus 13; P = 0.048) and at 48 hours after ICU admission
(17 versus 13; P < 0.001) were significantly higher in
patients who went on not to receive LT (See Figure 1).
On ICU admission, patients who died waiting for LT
had worse coagulopathy (INR 2.2 versus 2.0; P = 0.009),
acidemia (pH 7.36 versus 7.38; P = 0.019) and had higher
serum lactate levels (3.6 versus 2.6; P = 0.003). On admis￾sion, non-LT patients were more likely to be hypotensive
(MAP, 54 versus 66; P < 0.001) and to require vasopressor
support (64% versus 47%; P = 0.02).
iii) Multivariable analysis: predictors of transplant
(two sites)
After covariate-adjustment, SOFA on admission was not
significantly associated with receipt of LT (OR, 0.96; 95%
CI, 0.89 to 1.04; see Additional file 2). In multivariable

analysis of SOFA at 48 hours after admission, after
adjustment for patient age and other covariates except
lactate, higher SOFA at 48 hours was associated with a
lower likelihood of receiving LT (see Table 4: OR,

lactate at 48 hours is included in the model with other
covariates, 48-hour lactate appears to have a stronger
association with likelihood of transplant (OR, 0.32;
95% CI, 0.17 to 0.61; P = 0.001) compared with SOFA
(P = 0.19).

Discussion
We performed a retrospective cohort study from the five
largest liver-transplant centers in Canada to evaluate the
impact of critical illness and organ dysfunction on
short-term mortality after LT and on organ allocation
among critically ill cirrhosis patients listed for LT and
admitted to the ICU.
Key results
We found that among critically ill cirrhosis patients who
received LT, older age independently portends a signifi￾cantly higher risk for post-LT 90-day mortality. We also
showed that SOFA score on ICU admission, at 48
hours, and on the day of LT is not predictive of 90-day
mortality. When comparing those patients who received
LT from the ICU with those patients who died in the
ICU awaiting LT, we found that SOFA at 48 hours after
ICU admission is independently associated with a lower
likelihood of receiving LT. We also found that high lac￾tate (on admission and at 48 hours) and patient age are
independently associated with lower likelihood for LT.
Comparison with previous studies
This study extends on data from previous studies as it is
a multicenter study across an organ-sharing network
(Canada) and specifically focused on critically ill cirrho￾sis patients who were listed or received LT while
admitted to an ICU. In a Swiss observational study of
144 consecutive LT recipients, Oberkofler and collea￾gues [21] showed that a MELD >23 was predictive of
increased postoperative length of ICU stay but not
lower short-term survival [21]. This study, however, was
limited because of being representative of a single-center
study and including a heterogeneous cohort of ICU and
non-ICU patients receiving LT. Given that non-ICU
patients were included, only MELD (not SOFA) could
be evaluated. Nonetheless, this study showed no associa￾tion between MELD and post-LT outcome in the criti￾cally ill. Previously, Cholangitas and colleagues [22]
showed that, in nontransplanted cirrhosis patients from
a single center, prognostic scores had increased sensitiv￾ity at 48 hours rather than on admission and that SOFA
outperformed MELD and APACHE II (on admission).
However, this study did not directly evaluate outcomes
of critically ill cirrhosis patients receiving LT from the
ICU or predictors of receiving an LT. In another single￾center Taiwanese study, Wong et al. [23] found that
although the pre-LT SOFA score predicted unadjusted
3-month and 1-year survival, not all patients were criti￾cally ill and admitted to the ICU before LT, and no cov￾ariate adjustment was performed [23]. Although SOFA did
not appear to be independently associated with 90-day
survival in critically ill transplanted cirrhosis patients, our
data did show that a higher SOFA score 48 hours after
ICU admission was independently associated with a lower
likelihood of receiving LT. In contrast with a single-center
study from Umgelter and colleagues [24] that reported
overall 90-day mortality rates of almost 40% for trans￾planted critically ill cirrhosis patients (n = 23), in our
cohort, 90-day mortality was lower (16%).
Study limitations
Our study has several limitations that warrant consid￾eration. First, although our study is multicentric and
represents five major liver-transplant centers in Canada
(data not available from two other centers), it is rela￾tively small, and a retrospective analysis of prospectively
collected data is thereby potentially predisposed to
selection bias and residual confounding. Second, indivi￾dual centers vary in volume and make independent deci￾sions about listing for LT; hence variations may occur in
listing/de-listing practices across sites. However, the

All multivariable models were adjusted for site (two sites) and decade of transplant (2000 through 2009 versus 1990 through1990). Lactate (on admission and at
48 hours) was converted to a natural logarithm (normal distribution). Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit performed well (P > 0.3) for all models. All models
included age, gender (female), etiology (HCV versus non-HCV). Model 1 (n = 126, 95 missing) included lactate (natural log) at 48 hours after admission. Model 2
(n = 174, 37 missing) included SOFA score at 48 hours. Model 3 (n = 125, 96 missing) included SOFA score and lactate (natural log) at 48 hours. Significant
results (P values) included Age: Model 1 (P = 0.036), Model 3 (P = 0.043); SOFA (at 48 hours): Unadjusted (P < 0.001), Model 2 (P = 0.006); Lactate 48 hours after
admission (natural logarithm): Unadjusted (P < 0.001), Model 1 (P < 0.001), Model 3 (P = 0.001). See Additional file 2 for full derivation of all models and P values.

evaluation of health outcomes, such as organ allocation in
critically ill cirrhosis patients and their associated LT out￾comes to date has not been evaluated in a prospective
manner. Furthermore, all transplant centers that provided
data for this study participate in the Canadian Liver trans￾plant organ sharing network, in which decisions are often
made to transfer organs from different regions across the
country for critically ill cirrhosis patients requiring LT
[25]. Accordingly, replicating observational studies of this
nature has value to assess for consistency and generaliz￾ability. Third, although we attempted to collect data on
the donor risk index [19], our data were not complete for
all patients, and we used a modified donor-risk score.
Furthermore, we were unable to obtain reliable data on
surgical complications and intraoperative parameters from
all sites.
Finally, we acknowledge that age, as an independent
predictor of increased 90-day mortality, could potentially
be confounded by virtue of being a surrogate of increased
comorbidity [26]. However, as opposed to other critically
ill populations, LT candidates are often excluded for hav￾ing significant cardiopulmonary morbidity or coexisting
malignancy. Low Charlson comorbidity scores in this
cohort reflected this.
In this study, we found that SOFA was not indepen￾dently associated with short-term mortality after LT.
Because of the complexities of decision making in LT
and the inherent selection bias (that is, selected centers
may inherently decline sicker patients), it remains to be
determined whether SOFA is the best organ-failure
score with which to prognosticate in this cohort [13,22].
Given the limitation of retrospective studies, future
research should be focused on well-designed prospective
studies looking at reliable collection of multiple con￾founding variables. With adequate patient numbers for
derivation and validation of a prediction rule, a novel
dynamic scoring system that includes other factors (for
example, age, lactate) that are not incorporated into the
SOFA score could be derived to reflect accurately char￾acteristics that may not be shared between critically ill
patients listed for LT and other critically ill populations.
Important outcomes, besides mortality, also include the
impact of critical illness on health-service allocation
issues, such as length of time on mechanical ventilation/
renal replacement therapy, rehospitalization, and persis￾tent nonliver organ dysfunction (neurocognitive, respira￾tory, nutritional issues). Organ dysfunction has been
previously shown to affect cost significantly in critically
ill nontransplanted cirrhosis patients, and it would be
useful to look at the impact on transplant recipients [27].
Conclusions
SOFA does not appear to predict outcome after LT in
this cohort. However, higher SOFA scores at 48 hours
after admission, along with older age and serum lactate,
are associated with a lower probability of receiving LT.
Older critically ill cirrhosis patients (older than 60)
undergoing LT have significantly worse 90-day post-LT
mortality and should be considered for transplant with
caution.
Key messages
• SOFA does not appear to predict outcome after LT
in critically ill cirrhosis patients
• Older age is significantly associated with worse
early outcomes after LT in critically ill cirrhosis
patients
• Higher SOFA scores at 48 hours after ICU admis￾sion are associated with a lower probability of
receiving LT in critically ill cirrhosis patients listed
for LT.
• Higher serum lactate at 48 hours after ICU admis￾sion is associated with a lower probability of receiving
LT in critically ill cirrhosis patients listed for LT.
