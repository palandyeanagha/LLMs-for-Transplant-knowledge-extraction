Abstract
We report a Spanish family with autosomal-dominant non￾neuropathic hereditary amyloidosis with a unique hepatic
presentation and death from liver failure, usually by the
sixth decade. The disease is caused by a previously unre￾ported deletion/insertion mutation in exon 4 of the apolipo￾protein AI (apoAI) gene encoding loss of residues 60–71 of
normal mature apoAI and insertion at that position of two
new residues, ValThr. Affected individuals are heterozy￾gous for this mutation and have both normal apoAI and
variant molecules bearing one extra positive charge, as pre￾dicted from the DNA sequence. The amyloid fibrils are
composed exclusively of NH2
-terminal fragments of the
variant, ending mainly at positions corresponding to resi￾dues 83 and 92 in the mature wild-type sequence. Amyloid
fibrils derived from the other three known amyloidogenic
apoAI variants are also composed of similar NH2
-terminal
fragments. All known amyloidogenic apoAI variants carry
one extra positive charge in this region, suggesting that it
may be responsible for their enhanced amyloidogenicity. In
addition to causing a new phenotype, this is the first dele￾tion mutation to be described in association with hereditary
amyloidosis and it significantly extends the value of the
apoAI model for investigation of molecular mechanisms of
amyloid fibrillogenesis. (J. Clin. Invest. 1996. 97:2714–
2721.) Key words: amyloidosis • apolipoprotein AI • gene •

Introduction
Hereditary amyloidosis is an autosomal-dominant condition
caused by point mutations in the genes encoding a variety of
different proteins (reviewed in reference 1). These mutations
produce single-residue substitutions in the mature protein that
lead to the whole molecule, or a proteolytic cleavage fragment
being deposited extracellularly in the tissues as insoluble amy￾loid fibrils that accumulate and cause organ dysfunction pre￾senting in adult life. Mutations in the gene for b-amyloid pre￾cursor protein cause amyloid deposition that is confined to the
brain in familial Alzheimer’s disease (2, 3), and in hereditary
cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis (Dutch type) (4). How￾ever, in all other forms of hereditary amyloidosis, the deposits
are systemic even though the clinical presentation is usually
dominated by manifestations in particular organ systems. Mu￾tations in some genes cause very specific patterns of disease,
such as hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis (Ice￾landic type), associated with variant cystatin C (5) and Finnish
familial amyloidosis, associated with variants of gelsolin (6, 7).
Mutations in the genes for other amyloidogenic proteins cause
varied and overlapping clinical syndromes unrelated to the
protein involved, and the same mutation can produce a differ￾ent phenotype in different families and even between mem￾bers of the same family. This is the case in familial amyloid
polyneuropathy, the commonest form of hereditary amyloido￾sis, which can be caused by more than 50 different point muta￾tions in the transthyretin gene (8), and in hereditary nonneuro￾pathic amyloidosis which can be caused by mutations in the
genes for apoAI (9–12), lysozyme (13), and fibrinogen a-chain
(14, 15). Although the most common amyloidogenic trans￾thyretin variant, Met30Val, does not always cause disease, all
the amyloidogenic mutations in other genes seem to be com￾pletely penetrant. Nevertheless, there evidently are other ge￾netic and/or environmental factors unrelated to the amyloid
fibril protein itself that contribute to deposition of amyloid and
its clinical effects.
Apart from their intrinsic interest and the clinical signifi￾cance for the rare affected kindreds, the hereditary amyloi￾doses provide valuable models for analyzing the pathogenesis
of the common acquired forms of amyloidosis. The most im￾portant of these is Alzheimer’s disease, the fourth most com￾mon cause of death in the western world, and the discovery
that mutations in the gene-encoding b-amyloid precursor pro￾tein can cause early onset of familial Alzheimer’s has already
revolutionized work on this condition (2, 3). Furthermore, elu￾cidation of the molecular basis of amyloid-fibril formation,
which should be facilitated by study of the amyloidogenic vari￾ant proteins, may permit rational approaches to therapy. The
lysozyme mutations that cause nonneuropathic amyloidosis
(13) are particularly promising because all aspects of the struc￾ture and folding of this protein are so well characterized. How￾ever, apoAI offers a different but very intriguing challenge be￾cause, although its wild-type crystal structure has not yet been
determined, all three amyloidogenic variants contain arginine
substitutions for neutral residues within the NH2
-terminal re￾gion of the molecule, and it is this fragment that forms the
amyloid fibrils (10, 12, 16, 17). None of the other known apoAI

variants are amyloidogenic (18). We report here a family with
hereditary nonneuropathic amyloidosis caused by a new apoAI
variant, in which 12 residues in the amyloidogenic NH2
-termi￾nal fragment have been deleted and 2 residues inserted. This is
the first deletion mutation in any gene associated with heredi￾tary amyloidosis but, most importantly, it produces an extra
positive charge, suggesting that acquisition of such a charge in
this part of the apoAI molecule, rather than substitution by
any specific residue, may be the key amyloidogenic change.
Methods
Patients. An extended kindred from Cerdanya, Catalonia, Spain,
was identified with a high incidence of systemic amyloidosis present￾ing with slowly progressive and uniformly fatal liver involvement.
The diagnosis of amyloidosis was first made in two asymptomatic fe￾male first cousins (Fig. 1) with abnormal liver function tests detected
during routine screening at ages 60 and 55, and in whom liver biopsies
were then undertaken. Subsequently, the male proband for the
present study (Fig. 1), in whom chronic liver disease had been diag￾nosed at age 40, presented at age 61 with bleeding esophageal varices
and rapidly developed fatal hepatic encephalopathy.
Clinical investigations. All clinical chemistry, plasma lipid and li￾poprotein analyses, and histological examinations were performed by
standard procedures. Amyloid deposits were identified histologically
by green birefringence in polarized light after Congo red staining (19).
Identification, isolation, and characterization of amyloid fibrils.
Fresh frozen, unfixed tissue obtained at autopsy of the proband was
examined by immunohistochemical staining precisely as described
previously (11, 20). Amyloid fibrils were isolated from fragments of
spleen, liver, kidney, and heart by the water extraction method (21)
as lately modified for very small tissue samples (22). Their protein
subunits were separated in reduced SDS-PAGE, and subjected to au￾tomated amino acid–sequence analysis, as previously described (10,
23). The subunits were also excised from the gel and digested with en￾doproteinase lys-C. The resulting peptides were separated by reverse
phase HPLC with on-line diode array detection (1090M; Hewlett￾Packard Co., Palo Alto, CA). Fractions containing aromatic residues
were identified by their absorbance spectra and characterized by ma￾trix-assisted, laser desorption, time-of-flight mass spectrometry (La￾sermat; Finnigan MAT, Hemel Hempstead, Herts, UK) as described
before (10). Selected peptides were then sequenced. Amyloid fibrils
isolated from the spleen were also dissolved in guanidine hydrochlo￾ride, fractionated by gel filtration, and the single main subunit peak
analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry, all precisely as described
previously (10).
apoAI gene studies. DNA was extracted from the proband’s blood
and two fragments of the apoAI gene, comprising the region encod￾ing the NH2
-terminal region of apoAI, were amplified by PCR and
the nucleotide sequence determined, all as reported elsewhere (10).
The 59 end of exon 4 was abnormal, producing a PCR product of 361
bp as well as the normal 391-bp fragment. These were clearly distin￾guishable in a 3% gel of low melting point agarose and this procedure
was used to screen the family for other carriers. The fragments were
also excised from the gel, purified by Magiprep (Promega, Heidel￾berg, Germany) and sequenced (10).
Plasma apoAI analysis. Charge-variant apoAI was sought by iso￾electric focusing in urea-agarose gel of dilapidated whole plasma, fol￾lowed by pressure blotting and immunostaining with anti–apoAI an￾tiserum, as described previously (10, 24).
Serum amyloid P component (SAP)1
 scintigraphy. Scintigraphy af￾ter intravenous injection of radioiodinated pure human SAP was per￾formed exactly as described previously (25, 26) except that the iso￾tope iodine-131 was used instead of iodine-123. Although the image
quality is not as good, the longer isotope half-life was necessary be￾1. Abbreviation used in this paper: SAP, serum amyloid P component.

Results
Clinical features. Affected individuals in generations A and B
of the family (Fig. 1) died with liver failure between 48 and 66
yr of age. Apart from their abnormal liver function tests, no
other clinical or pathological information is available, but it is
likely that the female case in generation A was the source of
the disease. Cases in generation C were found to have abnor￾mal liver function tests at about 35–45 yr of age, but the pa￾tients all remained asymptomatic for the next 15–20 yr. During
this phase, serum concentrations of alkaline phosphatase, trans￾aminases, and g-glutamyl transpeptidase were raised, but bil￾irubin was normal. There were no symptoms or signs of in￾volvement of the kidneys, peripheral or autonomic nervous
system, or any other tissues or organs. Liver function slowly
deteriorated in all affected cases and in the proband there was
an unusually rapid progression over z 1 yr to frank cholestasis,
portal hypertension, hepatic encephalopathy, and death. Re￾nal failure and proteinuria occurred during the terminal liver
disease.
Percutaneous liver biopsies from four affected family mem￾bers in generation C showed similar histology, with some pres￾ervation of overall structure, but most of the portal tracts re￾placed by large amyloid nodules, with some compressed
arterioles and ductules at the periphery and a few foamy mac￾rophages. Central veins and hepatic trabeculae appeared nor￾mal. A transjugular liver biopsy, from the patient who sub￾sequently died and underwent postmortem examination,
consisted of fragments of heavily amyloid-laden tissue with
conspicuous venous structures, but no identifiable hepatocytes
or ductules.
At autopsy, his liver was markedly enlarged (6,000 g) with
a granular capsule and small focal parenchymal areas of calcifi￾cation. The right lobe was completely replaced by massive
amyloid deposition and the left contained large confluent amy￾loid nodules among areas of cholestatic hepatic tissue (Fig. 2).
The spleen was also large (1,300 g) with massive subcapsular
amyloid and multiple nodular deposits within the parenchyma,
unrelated to the white pulp (Fig. 3). The kidneys were small,
with hard yellow nodular masses in the papillae, corresponding
microscopically to diffuse interstitial amyloid deposition lim￾ited to the medulla, and associated with tubular atrophy. The
renal cortex contained no amyloid; there was moderate ath￾erosclerosis in the glomeruli and vessels. The heart was slightly
enlarged and contained extensive interstitial amyloid but myo￾cardial fibers were preserved. The adrenals were enlarged
(right, 60 g and left, 35 g) and massively infiltrated with amy￾loid, leaving only minimal islands of cortical cells. Both testes
were also massively replaced with amyloid and showed marked
atrophy of seminiferous tubules. There were perivenular amy￾loid deposits in the pituitary gland and its capsule and focal de￾posits were present in the thyroid, prostate, periprostatic sym￾Figure 2. Cryostat section of unfixed liver from the autopsy of the

pathetic ganglia, bone, and articular cartilage. The lamina
propria of the tongue contained a bandlike amyloid deposit,
but the rest of the gut was spared, as were the lungs, bronchi,
pancreas, lymph nodes, skin, and subcutaneous fat.
Identification of the amyloid fibril protein. Immunohisto￾chemical staining of all the amyloidotic tissues obtained at au￾topsy was strongly and specifically positive with antibodies to
apoAI (Fig. 3) and SAP, but was completely negative with an￾tibodies to amyloid A protein, k and l immunoglobulin light
chains, transthyretin, b2
-microglobulin, and lysozyme.
Characterization of the apoAI gene mutation. Sequencing of
the apoAI gene from the deceased patient revealed that he
was heterozygous for a mutation in exon 4 in which 35 nucle￾otides had been deleted from the wild-type sequence and 5 nu￾cleotides inserted, maintaining the reading frame (Fig. 4). The
mutation was readily demonstrable by gel analysis of the exon
4 PCR product (Fig. 5), and this test was used to screen all
members of the family from whom samples could be obtained.
The observed DNA changes encoded deletion of residues
60–71 of the mature wild-type amino acid sequence and their
replacement by two new residues, ValThr. This predicted ac￾quisition by the variant apoAI molecule of one additional pos￾itive charge, compared to wild-type apoAI.
Plasma lipid and lipoprotein studies. Among the family
members from whom results were available, the plasma levels
of apoAI and HDL were significantly lower in carriers of the
mutation than in unaffected individuals (Table I), and were
also lower than the normal range. There was a trend towards
higher levels of LDL among the cases, although this did not
achieve statistical significance, but the values for apoB, total
cholesterol, and triglycerides were the same in the two groups.
Subsequent measurements of plasma lipids and lipoproteins in
other laboratories showed exactly the same pattern in further
carriers and unaffected family members (data not shown).
A variant apoAI with one extra positive charge was de￾tected in the plasma of carriers of the mutation (Fig. 6), but
was significantly less abundant than wild-type apoAI, espe￾cially in one individual (Fig. 6, lane 1) with massive amyloido￾sis and a particularly low concentration of HDL and total
apoAI (z 50% of the lower limit of normal). The variant was
not detected in unaffected family members (Fig. 6).
Characterization of the amyloid fibril protein. Amyloid
fibrils isolated from spleen, liver, and kidney tissue consisted
predominantly of protein subunits running with apparent mass
of z 8–9 kD in SDS-PAGE, just ahead of the 10-kD subunit of
amyloid fibrils from a case of apoAI Arg60 hereditary amyloi￾Figure 4. Nucleotide se￾quence of part of exon 4 of

subunits in the present case as fragments of apoAI and this
was confirmed by automated amino acid sequencing, demon￾strating the amino terminal sequence of mature human apoAI.
Electrospray mass spectrometric analysis of the purified
spleen amyloid fibril subunits, separated by gel filtration, iden￾tified two dominant major species and a number of trace peaks
(Table II). The main peaks corresponded precisely to the
masses calculated for NH2
-terminal fragments of mature vari￾ant apoAI encoded by the observed mutation, encompassing
residues 1–83 and 1–92. The residues are numbered according
to the wild-type sequence, but the masses are calculated to in￾clude deletion of wild-type positions 60–71 and insertion of
ValThr at this point. Almost all the minor peaks could be
assigned to other NH2
-terminal fragments of the variant se￾quence, and no species corresponding to fragments from wild￾type apoAI were seen (Table II).
After endoproteinase lys-C digestion, no species corre￾sponding to the peptide expected from wild-type apoAI,
LREQLGPVTQEFWDNLEK, was found by HPLC and ma￾trix-assisted, laser desorption, time-of-flight analysis. How￾ever, a species with mass 1,004 D, corresponding to the peptide
VTWDNLEK predicted from the sequence of the variant
apoAI, was identified in each of four separate digests. This
material yielded a single amino acid sequence of VTW in each
case. It is not clear why sequencing was blocked after three
residues, but cyclization of the adjacent aspartic acid and as￾paragine residues during the Edman chemistry cycles may
have been responsible.
Radioiodinated SAP scintigraphy for amyloidosis. Scans
were performed in 13 family members. Four individuals from
generation C and three from generation D, none of whom car￾ried the apoAI gene mutation, showed no localization or re￾tention of tracer. However, all carriers of the mutation, includ￾ing four cases with amyloid confirmed histologically on liver
biopsy, had abnormal scans with uptake of tracer in the liver in
each case (Fig. 8), although there was considerable variation
between patients. The weakest signal was observed in a bi￾Figure 6. Immunoblot for apoAI of delipidated plasma after isoelec￾tric focusing in agarose gel. Lanes 1, 2 and 4, affected family mem￾bers; lane 3, unaffected family member; lane 5, normal control. The

yr after discovery of abnormal liver function tests. This sug￾gests that her amyloid load may be small and not increasing
rapidly. In contrast, other patients, all of whom are also asymp￾tomatic, had much more intense uptake in the liver and occa￾sionally also the spleen, indicating a heavy visceral amyloid
load, even at the much younger ages of 29 and 36 yr, and, pos￾sibly, predicting a more aggressive pattern of disease. No posi￾tive images of the kidneys, adrenals, or any other organs were
observed in any case, possibly because of overwhelming up￾take of tracer in the massive hepatic deposits.
Discussion
Affected members of the family described here had a unique
phenotype of hereditary, nonneuropathic systemic amyloidosis
that has not been reported previously and that was caused by
the first deletion mutation to be associated with amyloidosis.
Although at autopsy amyloid deposits were extremely wide￾spread, the clinical presentation, ensuing illness, and death
were all exclusively related to the massive hepatic involve￾ment. In common with most other forms of systemic amyloido￾sis, there was an asymptomatic prodromal phase lasting for
many years, with only biochemical evidence of disease. Never￾theless, liver biopsy or SAP scintigraphy demonstrated amy￾loid long before advent of clinical symptoms. Interestingly,
SAP scintigraphy suggested anticipation, at least with respect
to amyloid deposition, with three individuals in generation D
aged between 29 and 36 having substantially more amyloid
than four individuals in generation C aged between 54 and 67
yr. Also, six of the seven generation D cases carrying the caus￾ative apoAI gene mutation already had abnormal liver func￾Table II. Electrospray Mass Spectrometry of Purified Subunits from Splenic ApoAI Amyloid Fibrils. Measured and Calculated

tion tests at ages between 18 and 36; whereas, there was one 57-
yr-old carrier in generation C with no biochemical abnormality.
It remains to be seen whether clinical disease will also de￾velop earlier and/or progress more rapidly in the youngest
generation but, if it does, they may be candidates for orthoto￾pic liver transplantation. This would both replace organ func￾tion and reduce, though not eliminate, production of the amy￾loidogenic apoAI–variant protein. Liver transplantation has
been successful in hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis, elimi￾nating the source of the variant amyloidogenic protein from
the plasma and leading to clinical benefit in most patients and
regression of amyloid deposits (27–29). Although apoAI is
produced not only by the liver but also in the intestine and
elsewhere (30, 31), a significant reduction in availability of the
pathogenic variant might favorably reduce the rate of amyloid
deposition in a disorder that already has a very long presymp￾tomatic phase.
The concordance between the apoAI gene mutation dis￾covered here, the presence of the corresponding charge vari￾ant apoAI protein in the plasma, the presence of amyloid in
the tissues, the identification of apoAI as the amyloid fibril
protein, and the clinical and/or biochemical signs established
the mutation as the cause of the disease. It is highly penetrant
and, among the 31 family members whose DNA we have been
able to study, only 2 of the 13 carriers, aged 27 and 57, do not
yet have any disturbance of liver function. Neither of these
subjects has undergone either liver biopsy or SAP scintigraphy
so the presence of amyloid deposits is not excluded.
The mechanisms by which any of the amyloidogenic vari￾ants of apoAI, including the present one, form amyloid fibrils
are not known, but it is unlikely to be a coincidence that they
all carry one extra positive charge on the NH2
-terminal part of
the molecule and that the fibrils in all analyzed cases are com￾posed of this fragment. In amyloid fibrils of all types, the pro￾tein subunits are arranged in anti–parallel b-sheets lying with
their long axes perpendicular to the fibril long axis (32, 33).
Some intact native globular proteins, some fragments of larger
proteins, and some synthetic peptides have a high propensity
to aggregate and adopt this conformation; that is, they are
amyloidogenic in vivo or in vitro (1). The point mutations that
are responsible for the autosomal dominant hereditary amyloi￾doses evidently increase the amyloidogenicity of the affected
proteins. In the case of lysozyme, gelsolin, fibrinogen, and cys￾tatin C, the wild-type molecule is not known to be amyloidogenic
and either the whole or a fragment of the variant forms the
fibrils. In the case of transthyretin and b-amyloid precursor
protein, the wild-type molecule can be amyloidogenic in elderly
individuals, but this is greatly enhanced for the variants. After
the finding that wild-type apoAI causes senile pulmonary vas￾cular amyloidosis in dogs (34, 35), it has lately been discovered
that the frequent small amyloid deposits in the aortic wall of
elderly human subjects, associated with atheromatous plaques,
are also derived from wild-type apoAI (36).
ApoAI is thus an inherently amyloidogenic protein and
this has been confirmed by the formation of amyloid fibrils
from whole isolated apoAI in vitro (37), although in vivo the
apoAI fibril subunits consist of NH2
-terminal fragments. The
variants may have enhanced amyloidogenicity because the sub￾stitutions destabilize the native structure, promoting fibrillo￾genic aggregation with proteolytic cleavage as a secondary
phenomenon, or they may facilitate proteolytic cleavage of the
native molecule to yield fibrillogenic fragments. Also, all amy￾loid fibrils are tightly associated with polyanionic sulfated gly￾cosaminoglycans in vivo (38, 39) that are thought to contribute
to formation and/or stabilization of fibrils, and these interac￾tions could be enhanced by the cationic nature of the amy￾loidogenic apoAI variants. Interestingly, a synthetic peptide
corresponding to residues 9–20 of the wild-type apoAI se￾quence was amyloidogenic in vitro (36), although this does not
necessarily relate to fibrillogenesis by the much larger frag￾ments found in vivo. In the original case of Arg26 variant
apoAI (Iowa), the main fragment consisted of residues 1–83
(16), while in human senile aortic amyloid, it was 1–69 (36),
and in senile dogs 1–71 and 1–80 (34, 35), all determined only
by amino acid sequencing. In our electrospray mass spectrom￾etry study of the Arg60 variant, we found fragments 1–88, 92,
93, and 94 (10). In the present case, overwhelmingly the most
abundant fragments were from position 1 to the residues cor￾responding to positions 83 and 92 in the wild-type, but includ￾ing the deletion/insertion substitution that we have described
here. In addition, we detected traces of fragments 1–81, 82, 85,
88, 91, 93 102, 103, 105, 110, and 113. This level of precision
cannot be achieved by sequencing without mass spectrometry,
and it is likely that similar COOH-terminal raggedness and
heterogeneity is present in all cases. Either there is no particu￾lar, specifically amyloidogenic, cleavage point, or else the ini￾tial cleavage and/or subsequent COOH-terminal clipping pro￾ceed as postfibrillogenic events (40).
Mass spectrometry also identified the frequent presence of
sulfoxidation of Met86 in apoAI fibril subunits, both in the
present case and in the Arg60 individual (10). While this might
be an in vitro artifact generated during fibril isolation and pro￾tein purification, there is evidence that Met86 is relatively much
more resistant to oxidation in vivo and in vitro than Met112
and Met148 in wild-type apoAI (41). The amyloidogenic sub￾stitutions, or, in the present case, deletion/insertion, NH2
-ter￾minal to Met86, might affect this property and thereby influ￾ence cleavage of apoAI and/or its association with HDL (42).
Oxidation of apoAI can also enhance its polymerization (43).
In affected members of the present family, as in both the
original Arg26 cases (17, 44) and the first Arg60 kindred (10),
the plasma contained the expected charge variant form of
apoAI, but at a significantly lower abundance than the wild￾type protein in all individuals tested. This is compatible with
the accelerated plasma clearance of the variant directly docu￾mented for apoAI Arg26 by Rader et al. (44), who also showed
that clearance of normal apoAI was accelerated in carriers of
this mutation who had subnormal plasma apoAI and HDL lev￾els. However, after plasma clearance, the extravascular catab￾olism of variant apoAI was significantly slower than that of the
wild-type, indicating sequestration, possibly in the amyloid de￾posits (44). Carriers in the Spanish family studied here also
had subnormal plasma levels of both total HDL and of apoAI,
and the individual with the lowest plasma concentration of
variant compared to wild-type apoAI had massive hepatic and
other amyloid deposits.
Identification of this new amyloidogenic variant extends
the potential value of the apoAI model for studies of amy￾loidogenesis and enables informed testing and genetic counsel￾ing to be conducted in the affected family. Work on in vitro fi￾brillogenesis by apoAI is in progress and in the future, the
effects of liver transplantation on survival, plasma apoAI lev￾els and metabolism, and the natural history of extrahepatic
amyloid deposits will be of considerable interest.
