ABSTRACT 
Background: Recent studies indicate that a group of patients with cirrhosis receiving a liver transplantation for 
hepatocellular cancer (HCC) beyond the Milan Criteria (MC) can achieve a similar outcome compared to patients 
within these criteria. This study aims to investigate the value of the Asan critera (AC), up-to-7 criteria (UT7), 
French alpha-foetoprotein (AFP) model and Metroticket 2.0 (MT2.0) model compared to the MC. 
Methods: 526 patients transplanted for non-metastatic HCC were analyzed. Patient groups within and beyond MC 
and extended criteria were determined according to radiological assessment and AFP value at listing. 
Results: Overall survival (OS) and recurrence (RR) rates were similar between patients within MC and all 
extended criteria. Five-year OS within MC was 71.3% compared to 70.9% for AC, 71.4% for UT7, 69.7% for AFP￾model and 71.0% for MT2.0 criteria. Five-year RR within MC was 12.3% compared to 13.5% for AC, 13.0% for 
UT7, 14.3% for AFP-model and 13.2% for MT2.0 criteria. Patients beyond MC but within the extended criteria 
had tendency towards higher recurrence. 
Conclusions: All validated extended criteria (AC, UT7, AFP-model and MT2.0) could be proposed as alternatives 
to the MC with similar outcome. Prospective data are awaited to assess recurrence beyond MC. 
1. Introduction 
In the Eurotransplant (ET) countries the gold standard for liver 
transplantation (LT) in patients with hepatocellular cancer (HCC) are 
the Milan Criteria (MC). These criteria are derived from a prospective 
study published in 1996 by Mazzaferro et al. which studied 48 patients 
with cirrhosis and small, non resectable HCC [1]. Using these criteria (1 
lesion less than 5 cm or up to 3 lesions each not exceeding 3 cm at im￾aging, in absence of macrovascular invasion and extrahepatic metasta￾ses) results in a four-year overall and disease-free survival rates of 75% 
and 83% respectively [1,2] which is comparable to LT in cirrhotic pa￾tients not transplanted for cancer. The MC have been validated in 
multiple studies [2,3]. In recent years however, the MC have been 
challenged because similar post-transplant overall survival (OS) and 
recurrence rate (RR) could be achieved with extended criteria in mostly

retrospective cohorts. Furthermore approximately 25% of the patients 
classified as within MC before LT were beyond MC in the explant his￾tology. [2] The MC are being considered too strict, excluding unjustified 
specific subgroups who could benefit from LT. Different extended 
criteria were proposed based on morphometric criteria (e.g. the Asan 
Medical Centre criteria (AC), up-to-seven criteria (UT7) or University of 
California San Francisco criteria [4]) or adding a marker of biological 
behavior such as alpha-foetoprotein (AFP) in the French model, Met￾roticket 2.0 model (MT2) or Hangzhou criteria [5] (list is not 
exhaustive). 
The extended AC allow patients with up to 6 HCC nodules eligible for 
transplantation. The largest tumor diameter remains �5 cm, and there 
may be no gross vascular invasion. These criteria are based on a single￾center study including 221 patients with HCC who underwent living 
donor LT. The 5-year OS was 76.3% and 18.9% within and beyond the 
AC. There was a 3-year RR of 9.1% in patients exceeding the MC but 
within the AC. The AC have been validated in non-living donor LT in 
western countries [6–8]. 
In 2009 Mazzaferro et al. proposed the UT7 criteria as the result of a 
multicenter retrospective European study with seven being the maximal 
allowed sum of the size of the largest tumor (in cm) and the number of 
tumors for any given HCC (if microvascular invasion was absent). The 5- 
year OS in this group of 283 patients was 71.2%, which was not 
significantly different from patients within the MC. The 5-year RR for 
patients within the UT7 criteria was 9.1% [9]. Recently the MT2.0 
model was published incorporating AFP in the UT7 criteria [10]. For 
patients with HCC to have a 70% chance of HCC-specific survival 5 years 
after transplantation, their level of AFP should be < 200 ng/mL and the 
sum of number and size of tumors should not exceed 7; if the level of AFP 
was 200–400 ng/mL, the sum of the number and size of tumors should 
be � 5 and if their level of AFP was 400–1000 ng/mL, the sum of the 
number and size of tumors should be � 4. 
Another promising model based on AFP, published by Duvoux et al. 
[11] has been implemented in France. According to this AFP-model 
patients with 1–3 tumors and a largest tumor diameter of 6 cm, or 
with �4 lesions with a maximal diameter of 3 cm are considered eligible 
for transplantation if their AFP level is � 100 ng/mL. Among patients 
within MC, the model identified a subgroup of patients with AFP values 
greater than 1000 ng/mL at high risk of recurrence and reduced 
survival. 
In this retrospective, multicentric study the aim was to further 
investigate the value of the Asan criteria (AC), the up-to-7 criteria (UT7), 
the AFP-model (AFP) and the metroticket 2.0 model (MT2.0) as recently 
validated extended scoring systems, compared to the MC as gold stan￾dard. For this purpose we evaluated the overall survival (OS) and 
recurrence rate (RR) of patients within and beyond the MC and extended 
criteria. The groups were defined at listing as this best reflects clinical 
practice. We also compared the outcome of the subgroup of patients 
beyond the MC, but within the extended criteria. Secondly, we defined 
the same groups according to the available data at transplantation to 
address the possible influence of bridging therapy during waiting time 
on our results. 
2. Patients and methods 
2.1. Patients 
714 adult patients with a pre-operative radiological diagnosis of non￾metastatic HCC who were listed for LT from 1999 to 2016 were included 
in this retrospective multicentric Be-LIAC study. Due to missing data, 
526 patients were finally analyzed at listing and 203 patients at 
transplantation. 
Patients were enrolled from the 6 different transplant centers in 
Belgium. Forty-four percent (n ¼ 233) of patients were transplanted at 
the Catholic University of Louvain, 20.9% (n ¼ 110) at University Hos￾pital Leuven, 17.3% (n ¼ 91) at Ghent University Hospital, 10.5% 
(n ¼ 55) at Erasme Hospital Free University of Brussels, 4.2% (n ¼ 22) at 
University Hospital of Li�ege and 2.9% (n ¼ 15) at University Hospital of 
Antwerp. 
The mean age at liver transplantation (LT) was 58.7 years. 77.4% of 
patients were male, 22.6% female The most common underlying chronic 
liver diseases were alcoholic liver disease (43.0% of patients), hepatitis 
C (31.7%), hepatitis B (9.5%) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (6.3). 
The mean lab-MELD score at listing was 11.4 (SD: �4.2). The mean time

time and treatment on the waiting list. 
Patient groups were determined according to radiological, pre￾operative MC and extended criteria at listing and transplantation. The 
AFP level was also considered at listing and transplantation. Time of 
death and/or recurrence were recorded. 
2.3. Statistical analysis 
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS statistics 23. Survival￾and recurrence-rates were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves and 
groups were compared using a log-rank test. P < 0.05 was considered 
statistically significant. 
3. Results 
3.1. Overall survival and recurrence rate for patients within and beyond 
the MC and extended criteria 
At listing 17.1% of patients were beyond MC. For the extended 
criteria 7.8%, 8.3%, 8.9% and 11% of patients were beyond AC, UT7, 
AFP-model and MT2.0 criteria respectively. There was a significant 
higher OS and lower RR in the group of patients within MC compared to 
patients beyond MC (p < 0.05). These results were also seen for all 
extended criteria (p < 0.05) (Table 2). 
The 1-,3-,5-, and 10-year OS and RR between the subgroup of pa￾tients within MC or within the extended criteria were found to be similar 
(Figs. 1 and 2). The 5-year OS for patients within MC was 71.3% 
compared to 70.9% for AC, 71.4% for UT7, 69.7% for AFP-model and 
71.0% for MT2.0 criteria. All criteria showed an 10-year OS of more than 
50%. The 5-year RR for patients within MC was 12.3% and for the 
extended criteria: 13.5% for the AC, 13.0% for UT7, 14.3% for AFP￾model and 13.1% for MT2.0 criteria (Table 3). 
At transplantation 27.0% of patients were beyond MC. For the 
extended criteria 6.4%, 11.8%, 15.3% and 16.7% of patients were 
beyond AC, UT7, AFP-model and MT2.0 criteria respectively (Table 6). 
The 5-year OS for patients within MC was 73.7% compared to 73.9% for 
AC, 74.9% for UT7, 75.0% for AFP-model and 75.2% for MT2.0 criteria. 
The 5-year RR for patients within MC was 11.4% and for the extended 
criteria: 12.7% for the AC, 12.2% for UT7, 13.1% for AFP-model and 
11.9% for MT2.0 criteria (Table 7). 
3.2. Overall survival and recurrence rate for patients beyond MC but 
within extended criteria 
Subgroup analysis compared patients within MC versus patients 
beyond MC but still within the extended criteria. At listing the 5-year OS 
for patients beyond MC, but within AC was 66.9%, 71.5% for UT7, 
61.0% for AFP-model and 74.8% for MT2.0 criteria. All extended 
criteria achieved an 10-year OS of more than 50%. The 3-year RR was 
23,7%, 18.8%, 24.2% and 19.3% for the AC, UT7, AFP-model and MT2.0 
criteria respectively. All recurrences occurred within the first 3-years of 
follow-up (Tables 3–5, Fig. 3) (See. Table 8) 
At transplantation the 5-year OS for patients beyond MC, but within 
AC was 75.0%, 77.5% for UT7, 82.6% for AFP-model and 84.4% for 
MT2.0 criteria. The 3-year RR was 13,9%, 11.1%, 18.3% and 12.5% for 
the AC, UT7, AFP-model and MT2.0 criteria respectively (Table 9). 
4. Discussion 
In this validation study the use of extended criteria for selecting 
patients with HCC in liver cirrhosis for LT was investigated by com￾parison with the MC as ‘gold standard’. Since Mazzaferro’s study in 
1996, many attempts have been made to expand (and improve) these 
criteria. Several authors have described modest expansions of the MC in 
size and/or number of HCC lesions on imaging or explant, with 
acceptable OS and RR. Tumor differentiation and vascular invasion are 
also predictors of outcome after LT, but only available after pathologic 
examination of the specimen. Therefore surrogate markers reflecting 
tumor biology such as Alpha-foetoprotein (AFP) [11–13] are likely to 
become more important in future allocation systems. Furthermore, dy￾namic variables for example the waiting time on the transplant list, 
radiological response after locoregional therapy and the evolution in 
AFP on the waiting list are currently being explored [14–17]. 
Until now there is no uniformity concerning the most valid alterna￾tive allocation system. It is a fact however, that an increasing percentage 
of patients with HCC undergoes transplantation beyond conventional 
indications. Recently, the use of (non-specified) extended criteria has 
also been cited in international guidelines which leads to non-uniformed 
allocation protocols between different centers [18,19]. Consequently 
validation of extended criteria is an important and urgent need. 
In the studied Be-LIAC cohort the OS was 64.4% (n ¼ 339/526) and 
the RR 14.6% (n ¼ 77/526) during a mean follow-up after LT of 56.1 
months (SD: �43.7). Patients within MC had a 5-year OS of 71.3% and 5- 
year RR of 12.3%. At listing 17.1% of patients were beyond MC. There

was a significant higher OS and lower RR in the group of patients within 
MC compared to patients beyond MC (p < 0.05). These results were also 
seen for the different groups of patients within each studied extended 
criteria compared to patients beyond the criteria (p < 0.05). Moreover 
the 1-,3-,5-, and 10-year OS and RR between patients within MC or the 
extended criteria were found to be similar. These results could be 
strengthened with similar findings at transplantation, taking into ac￾count the possible influence of bridging therapy during waiting time. 
Altogether the results suggest that all extended criteria can be used as an 
alternative for the MC. To our knowledge this is also the first large, 
multicentric study that can retrospectively validate the recently pub￾lished MT2.0 model. 
However our results must be interpreted with caution. Comparing 
patients within and beyond the extended criteria is not sufficient, 
because of a dilution effect of all the included patients within the MC. 
Subgroup analysis showed that patients beyond MC but within all the 
extended criteria had a tendency towards higher RR. This finding re￾flects the Metroticket paradigm introduced by Mazzaferro et al., in 2009, 
stating that the further the distance from conventional limits, the higher 
the price in terms of malignant recurrences [3,20]. On the other hand 
the 5-year OS for the subgroup of patients beyond MC but within the 
extended criteria was more than 50%. All the criteria met the 5-year 
patient survival rate of at least 61% required for an allocation system 
to be seen as ethically acceptable comparing the survival benefit of LT 
for a patient beyond the MC and the harm caused to other patients on the 
waiting list. However, this calculation is related to the waiting time and 
characteristics of donation [21]. The small number of patients and 
events (death as well as recurrence) in this subgroup of our cohort is too 
limited for reliable statistical analysis or definite conclusions. The sta￾tistical analysis was also not powered to show equivalence between the 
MC and the extended criteria. 
Another remark is the limited number of patients at the utter limits of 
the extended criteria. In the studied cohort the mean diameter of the 
largest lesion in the subgroup beyond MC but within extended criteria 
was 3.3 (�SD: 1.0) for AC, 3.5 (�SD: 1.3) for UT7, 3.4 (�SD: 1.4) for 
AFP-model and 3.5 (�SD: 1.3) for MT2.0 criteria. This might have given 
an overestimation of the good performance of the extended criteria. 
Considering the time point of listing for liver transplantation to 
validate allocation criteria best reflects clinical practice and decision 
making. However during the waiting time (5.7 � 6.4 months) lesions 
might have been falsely underestimated due to tumor growth. On the 
other hand many patients (53.0%) received bridging therapy which 
might have overestimated lesions at listing in case of tumor shrinkage. 
For this reason we secondly analyzed the same groups at the nearest 
time point before transplantation and found similar results. The main 
problem with this last approach is that in daily practice standardized 
imaging is not performed exactly at the time of transplantation, resulting 
for this retrospective study in missing or less accurate data with smaller 
subgroups and fewer events. 
When extending criteria the availability of donor organs should be 
taken into account. The amount of extra eligible patients for LT would be 
10.1% when using AC, 9.5% for UT7, 12.5% for the AFP-model and 
9.4% for the MT2.0 models. A limitation to this estimation is the in￾clusion of only transplanted patients in this study. A potentially sub￾stantial group of patients that are beyond MC but within extended 
criteria have never been transplanted and were not taken into account. 
For the same reason we have no data about the dropout rate on the 
waiting list. 
Finally, extending criteria should not be the only field that merit 
attention. Other options to optimize patient survival and reduce the RR 
after LT should be looked at such as pre-operative imaging techniques 
using PET-CT scan [22], the use of mTOR inhibitors [23–25] as immu￾nosuppressive regimen and most importantly the benefit of locoregional 
therapies with the proper assessment and timing of response [26–28]. In 
this regard the latest EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines (2018) state that 
LT for patients beyond MC can be considered after successful down￾staging to within MC within defined protocols [17]. 
Altogether this study again urges the ongoing debate whether it is 
still too early to expand beyond the MC. In the variety of published 
criteria there is not yet a consensus on which parameters to use. It is 
likely that current proposals will need modifications in the next years 
and that boundaries will be pushed further in every new trial. For 
example the extended Toronto criteria include patients with any size or 
number of tumors for transplantation (since 2004) provided they do not 
have systemic cancer-related symptoms, extrahepatic disease, vascular 
invasion, or poorly differentiated tumors on tumor biopsy of the largest 
lesion [29]. We are limited by the fact that current knowledge is almost 
completely based on retrospective validation studies. Prospective data 
from centers already using extended criteria in real life are still awaited. 
On the other hand, by using the MC, we might deny good candidates for 
transplantation a possible curative treatment. It is of utmost importance 
not to miss an opportunity to uniform the used allocation criteria. 
5. Conclusion 
In this Be-LIAC multicenter study similar overall survival and 
recurrence rate were observed in patients within MC and all extended 
criteria (AC, UT7, AFP-model and MT2.0). Therefore these criteria could 
be considered as alternative selection criteria for liver transplantation in 
HCC patients with an underlying liver disease. Prospective studies are 
warranted as an increased recurrence rate in the subgroup of patients 
beyond MC has been observed in this cohort.
