Somatic cells that change from one mature phenotype to another exhibit the property of plasticity. It is increas￾ingly clear that epithelial and endothelial cells enjoy some of this plasticity, which is easily demonstrated by study￾ing the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Published reports from the literature typically rely
on ad hoc criteria for determining EMT events; consequently, there is some uncertainty as to whether the same
process occurs under different experimental conditions. As we discuss in this Personal Perspective, we believe that
context and various changes in plasticity biomarkers can help identify at least three types of EMT and that using a
collection of criteria for EMT increases the likelihood that everyone is studying the same phenomenon — namely,
the transition of epithelial and endothelial cells to a motile phenotype.
In the early 19th century, building on observations of microsco￾pists now ancient, Schleiden and Schwann formulated the doc￾trine that cells are building blocksfor plant and animal tissues(1).
By the mid-19th century, Raspail, Remak, and Virchow expanded
this hypothesis by suggesting that all cells come from preexisting
cells — the so-called cell theory. Although referring to cell division,
this now classic notion is prescient of another contemporary twist
in the biology of cell maturation: beyond lineage development and
normal differentiation, mature epithelial cells under new envi￾ronmental pressures exhibit a local plasticity that allows them to
morph into other mature phenotypes with or without prolifera￾tion (2, 3). Growing interest in the biology of these cellular transi￾tions helped both establish epithelial cell plasticity as a field of
study in the late 20th century and fashion much of the current
thinking regarding morphogenesis in early embryonic develop￾ment, tissue repair, and cancer metastasis (4–6). The details of
some of these processes are not discussed here, asthey are outlined
in other articles in this Review Series on epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) (7, 8). Instead, we offer a personal view gathered
from our own experience and the literature regarding an approach
documenting EMT eventsin culture or tissue. We hope thisserves
to stimulate other points of view as new data emerge.
Epithelial cell plasticity
The notion of epithelial cell plasticity derives largely from early
studies of tissue regeneration in primitive experimental models.
These models involve a variety of tissues, many of which have an
epithelial component. For example, both amputated and injured
structuresfrom Urodela (newts and salamanders)regenerate dam￾aged partsrather than scarring over wounds. Regenerative plastic￾ity in these species is seen in limbs, facial bones, and tails; along
the spinal cord and in the eye (retina, lens, and optic nerve); and in
organs such as the intestinal tract and heart (9, 10). Such plastic￾ity has been rigorously studied in the primitive epithelial lens (10,
11), probably because the eye of newts is a site of immunologic
privilege — where immune responses are constrained and tissues
protected from inflammation and scarification (9, 10). The lizard
represents a phylogenic transition toward more complex organ￾isms, as its tail (12, 13), but not limbs (14), first scar and then
regenerate blastema to replace the missing appendage. Evidence
for tissue regeneration in primates is scarce, except in the liver,
occasional peripheral neurons, and the finger tips in limited cir￾cumstances (15). Wounds that are severe or caused by persistent
injury typically heal as fibrotic scars.
In mammals, experimental work on epithelial cell plasticity
mainly follows the trail of two broad interests, metaplasia and
EMT (Figure 1 and Categories of epithelial cell plasticity). With regard
to EMT, it is important to note that it was agreed in 2003, at the
first meeting of The EMT International Association (TEMTIA),
in Port Douglas, Australia, that epithelial-mesenchymal transfor￾mation and epithelial-mesenchymal transdifferentiation would be
called epithelial-mesenchymal transition going forward.
Metaplasia is the conversion of one differentiated cell type into
another, as observed in experimental tissue remodeling and ran￾dom pathological tissue specimens, where it occurs spontane￾ously. Metaplasia is something cell biologists now call transdif￾ferentiation. Evidence of transdifferentiation in mammalian cells
is not as common as in amphibians but has been observed among
islet cells, hepatocytes, lactotrophs, pneumocytes, and interca￾lated tubular cells (5, 16).
EMT involves the formation of motile cells from parent epithe￾lial cells that are not themselves motile. Discrete, age- or stage￾dependent conversion of primitive epithelial cells into motile
cells by EMT is seen in early embryogenesis, when it is involved in
gastrulation and neural crest migration. Later in organogenesis,
the expression of local developmental cytokines drives second￾ary epithelial cells and endothelial cells (specialized squamous
epithelial cells) to become fibroblasts through EMT. The fibro￾blasts generated by this process form endocardial cushions; close
the cranial plates, facial bones, and mid-line palate; and populate
interstitial spaces with resident fibroblasts as part of the normal
expansion of connective tissues. In adult life, the cytokine bath
generated by persistent tissue injury drives the formation of an
abundance of fibroblasts by the same mechanism (4, 5, 17). EMT
is also seen in subsets of carcinoma cells undergoing phenotypic
conversion for invasion and metastasis (18, 19), suggesting that
epithelial carcinomas create motile cancer cells by reusing some
part of the molecular EMT program that normally serves the for￾mation of adult fibroblasts (20).

Different types of EMT
The field of EMT today is vastly more expansive in scope and under￾standing than itwasjust a fewyears ago, particularlywith newwork
on the role of EMT in tissue fibrosis and cancer metastasis (4, 6,
21). The study of various modelsystemsinvolving an abundance of
different epithelial cell types, often examined in culture and out of
biological context, lends considerable uncertainty to the nature of
common signaling and transcriptional pathways predictive of EMT.
This is particularly true when one tries to compare mRNA pools
generated under various experimental conditions.In March 2008, at
an EMT meeting at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, we and others
(8)suggested there is heuristic value in parsing EMT into three gen￾eral subtypes based simply on the context under which they occur
(Figure 1 and Categories of epithelial cell plasticity). Type 1 EMT involves
primitive epithelial cells transitioning to motile mesenchymal cells
as part of gastrulation and primitive neuroepithelial cells gener￾ating migrating neural crest cells. In both situations, some of the
cells generated by EMT are re-induced as secondary epithelial cells
in mesodermal and endodermal organs by mesenchymal-epithe￾lial transition (MET). Type 2 EMT involves secondary epithelial
or endothelial cells transitioning to resident tissue fibroblasts. In
mature tissues, these fibroblasts are induced in response to persis￾tent inflammation. Type 3 EMT involves epithelial carcinoma cells
in primary nodulestransitioning to metastatic tumor cellsin order
to migrate through the blood stream and, in some cases, form sec￾ondary nodulesin distant metastatic sites by MET.
When the process of EMT islooked at in this way, it isimportant
to preserve the possibility of common mechanisms, recognizing
that the three subtypes of EMT have some phenotypic similari￾ties, but also many differences. For example, it islikely that mRNA
pools from each subtype of input cells (primitive, secondary,
and tumor epithelial cells) are considerably different, with many
unshared transcripts. Likewise, the output cells (mesenchymal
cells, fibroblasts, and metastatic tumor cells, respectively) have
little in common other than the ability to move and are likely to
express different pools of mRNA. We believe that parsing EMT
into three subtypes will encourage comparisons among similar
models and help identify better candidate small molecules predic￾tive or instructive of type-specific transitions.
EMT resulting in either mesenchymal cells or fibroblasts
A principal distinction between the EMT involving primitive
epithelial cells and that involving secondary epithelial cells is
that type 1 EMT during embryogenesis produces mesenchymal
Figure 1
Epithelial cell plasticity can be viewed as a form of either transdifferentiation (metaplasia) or EMT. Transdifferentiation generally refers to a pro￾cess whereby one mature epithelial cell phenotype converts into a different mature epithelial cell, with or without cell division. It is unclear whether 
transdifferentiation involves a transition state. Three types of EMT are recognized depending on the phenotype of the output cells. Type 1 
EMT is seen when primitive epithelial cells transition into mesenchymal cells that form the diaspora of the basic body plan following gastrulation 
or neural crest migration. These mesenchymal cells either undergo MET to form secondary epithelial cells or apoptose. Type 2 EMT is seen 
when secondary epithelial cells or endothelial cells populate interstitial spaces with resident or inflammation-induced fibroblasts, the latter during 
persistent injury. Type 3 EMT is part of the metastatic process, whereby epithelial tumor cells leave a primary tumor nodule, migrate to a new 
tissue site, and reform as a secondary tumor nodule.

cells, whereas type 2 EMT in adult or maturing tissues results in
fibroblasts. From a historical perspective, little serious thought
has been given to the origin of fibroblasts and their relation to
mesenchymal cells. Primitive epithelial cells in Metazoans form
primary mesenchymal cells by type 1 EMT during gastrulation (22,
23). These mesenchymal cells disperse and are variably induced,
through MET, to form secondary epithelial cellsthatsupport early
organogenesis. Unused mesenchymal cells that remain undergo
programmed cell death (24). Coincident with organogenesis and
the appearance of secondary (MET-derived) epithelial cells, fibro￾blastsfirst appearin mice after E9 following type 2 EMT in matur￾ing tissues(25, 26). Because fibroblasts move, have front end–back
end polarity, elongate with filopodia, and look like mesenchymal
cells (17), and because we tend to label the two cell types inter￾changeably — particularly when referring to transitions in adult
tissues — both cells are understandably and unfortunately misla￾beled in the biomedical literature.
Other than the fact that mesenchymal cells have a shape that
resembles fibroblasts and, like fibroblasts, express fibronectin
and fibrillar collagens, there is no evidence that fibroblasts are of
direct lineage descent from primitive mesenchymal cells. Tissue
fibrosis, for example, does not occur during early embryogenesis,
at least not until organogenesis begins (25) and the immune sys￾tem reaches a functional level of maturity (27). Consistent with
this observation isthe fact that most mammalian tissues enjoy less
immunologic privilege than the tissues of species such as Urodela
and the realization that primitive mesenchymal cells are not likely
to be true fibroblasts (25); that is, early embryos do not scar (28),
and, unlike fibroblasts, primary mesenchymal cells are multipo￾tent (29, 30),susceptible to MET (31), and do not express proteins
that uniquely define fibroblasts (25).
It is only once fibroblasts formed by type 2 EMT materialize in
the interstitial spaces between developing secondary epithelium
and endothelium that these tissues are primed for an inducible
fibrogenic response consequent to persistent inflammation.
Fibroblast formation and fibrosis, therefore, are principally a
feature of immunologic and tissue maturation. More recently, it
has been observed that fibroblasts harvested from various tissues
have distinct gene profiles (32) and behave dif￾ferently following exposure to assorted matrices
and cytokines (33). This is entirely consistent
with the topographic distribution of variable
pools of mRNA in fibroblasts, perhaps based
on a sequential Hox gene code instructing dif￾ferences in mRNA pools according to regions
of the body plan (32, 34). Although this later
notion has been interpreted through the nar￾row prism of mesenchymal cell ancestry, it is
also completely consistent with the notion
that fibroblasts formed by EMT differentially
express genes or signaling pathways dependent
on their previous life as mature epithelial or
endothelial cells, and theoretically could be as
heterogeneous as their parent cells.
EMT involving metastatic cancer cells
The concept that EMT involves the formation
of metastatic cancer cells is based on the obser￾vation that acquisition of mesenchymal mark￾ers such as vimentin or S100A4 (also known as
fibroblast-specific protein 1 [FSP1]) by epithelial carcinoma cells
is associated with increased metastatic potential (18), as is nuclear
overexpression of β-catenin (35) and loss of epithelial cell adhesion
molecules such as E-cadherin (18, 20, 36–38). Type 3 EMT, while
sharing some phenotypic similarities with othertypes of EMT, also
may invoke the expression of more primitive markerssuggestive of
stem cells (39). Two recent interesting points about EMT produc￾ing fibroblasts can also be made in the setting of cancer. First, fibro￾blasts adjacent to primary epithelial tumor nodules share some
genetic mutationswith the tumor cells,suggesting thattype 2 EMT
forming fibroblasts occurs prior to the full onset of tumorigenesis
(40, 41). On the other hand,studies comparing mutationsin cancer
cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts isolated from distant meta￾static tumortissue fail to demonstrate a cancer cell origin forthese
fibroblasts(42),suggesting that once epithelialtumor cells emerge,
they no longer are a source of fibroblasts. Rather,the cancer-associ￾ated fibroblasts in metastatic sites are likely to be either attracted
to a secondary tumor nodule from the localresident population or
derived from endothelial sprouts that form neovascular vessels as
the secondary nodules enlarge (43). Second, whereas type 2 EMT
involves the transition of adult epithelial or endothelial cells into
fibroblasts, type 3 EMT implies something different. Type 3 EMT
is not a mechanism forforming fibroblasts, but a processthat uses
this mechanism to transition and ready nodular tumor epithelial
cells for movement, invasion, and metastasis (20).
We review here some thoughts on criteria and common biomark￾ers for EMT in all three subtypes. Truly remarkable advances have
been made in unraveling this interesting phenomenon of pheno￾typic transition, particularly in the generation of fibroblasts.
In vitro and in vivo criteria for type 2 EMT producing 
fibroblasts
Since the in vitro demonstration of EMT by urodele corneal,
notochord, limb, and lens epithelial and endothelial cells in col￾lagen gel immersion experiments in 1982 (44), much interest has
focused on how to better detect epithelial cells undergoing EMT
to become fibroblasts in different culture systems and tissues.

ment of movement is possible during EMT in culture, these are
more difficult to recognize in tissues. Indeed, one of the histori￾cal problems in studying fibroblast lineage during EMT has been
the lack of highly specific markers. In 1995, we reported from
genetic screens that all fibroblasts express FSP1 and are likely
to appear through type 2 EMT (26). This transition was demon￾strated more convincingly in lineage-tracing studies during the
formation of fibroblastsin renal tissues(45). Subsequent lineage￾tracing studies confirmed these findings in other organs, includ￾ing liver, lung, and heart (46–48). Of special interest, recently we
found that endothelial cells also undergo type 2 EMT to form
FSP1+ fibroblasts in heart (47) and kidney (49). Both epithelial
and endothelial cells are likely to be substratesfor new fibroblasts
in adult tissue. A commonly used marker of active fibroblasts is
α-SMA (50), but it is not specific for fibroblasts (51), as only a
subset of fibroblasts express this protein (4). Elizabeth Hay (17)
also points out that mesenchymal cells and fibroblasts should
not be defined on the basis of α-SMA stress fibers, as such myofi￾broblast phenotypes are not thought to actively migrate. Insights
from FSP1 studies used to detect type 2 EMT in vitro and in vivo
have also served as a basisforstudies of type 3 EMT involving can￾cer cells (20). New lineage-tracing technology in transgenic mice
may allow this to be mapped in vivo (52).
Published studies often use somewhat random or ad hoc cri￾teria for identifying EMT. The field has continued to grow, with
nearly 600 articles now published on this subject. As we discuss
here, from this work derive a few useful parametersforrecognizing
EMT either in cell culture or in tissues (see In vitro criteria for EMT
and In vivo criteria for EMT). We believe that using a collection of
criteria for EMT increasesthe likelihood that everyone isstudying
the same phenomena experimentally regardless of EMT type.
In vitro EMT. In vitro evidence for type 2 EMT is suggested by
the transition of defined epithelial cells into fibroblasts over a few
days of culture. It has been known for decadesthat cultures of pri￾mary mammalian epithelial cells are at risk for contamination by
fibroblast overgrowth, even if the culture was derived from a single
epithelial cell. This occurrence of spontaneous type 2 EMT in cul￾ture is variable, and we suggest it is probably a function of unpre￾dictable amounts of cytokines in different batches of fetal calf
serum, the likely culprit being TGF-β. In controlled type 2 EMT
experiments, using cultures of tubular epithelial cells, the addition
of TGF-β (3 ng/ml) plus EGF (10 ng/ml) to serum-free medium
produces consistent rates of type 2 EMT that are completed by 5
days (53, 54). Early removal of the ligands that induce type 2 EMT
in some culture systems allows restoration of the epithelial cell
phenotype, something known as reversible scatter (4), suggesting
that the plasticity between type 2 EMT and MET is dynamic and
can be pushed in either direction (5). Classically, active push back
toward MET in mice occurs in the presence of bone morphoge￾netic protein 7 (BMP-7) (55).
Epithelial cellstransitioning to fibroblastslose polarity; increase
their nuclear expression ofseveraltranscription factors(see below);
lose the expression of E-cadherin,syndecan-1, and zona occludens 1
(ZO-1); increase theirsynthesis of cytoskeletal proteins(see below);
rearrange actin stress fibers; become spindle-shaped; and start to
move. Only later and variably do fibroblasts express α-SMA as myo￾fibroblasts (see In vitro criteria for EMT). Transitioning epithelial
cells are also resistant to apoptosis(56, 57). The in vitro migration
of new fibroblasts following type 2 EMT is the expected mature
function of this phenotypic transition (53, 58–60). The fibroblasts
formed should also show a stable phenotype on removal of the
induction stimulus and with passage or time.
In vivo EMT. In vivo evidence for type 2 EMT is more difficult
to document, because many of the tissue landmarks are disrupt￾ed by inflammation and cicatrization. In experimental systems,
the cleanest approach to identify type 2 EMT is to use reporter
genesin epithelial and endothelial cellsthat can be tracked in new
fibroblasts on transition (45–48). When marking studies are not
possible, such as in human tissues, epithelial or endothelial cell
expression of FSP1 adjacent to a disrupted basement membrane,
occasionally associated with cell elongation toward the intersti￾tial spaces, is suggestive (26). Some FSP1+ epithelial cells in this
transitional environment should show new expression of HSP47
(51) or collagen type 1, the latter being much more difficult to
demonstrate, and partial to complete loss of E-cadherin and cyto￾keratin (4). α-SMA can be seen in mature fibroblasts but is not
expected in newly transitioning epithelial cells (17). Transitioning
epithelial cells normally exhibit new expression of transcription

factors (61–63) and nuclear localization of CArG box–binding
factor–A (CBF-A) (54) and complexes of β-catenin and lymphoid
enhancer–binding factor (LEF) (64). EMT by definition is a plastic
process with various intermediate stages, and it is likely that the
changing markers mentioned above are present to a varying degree
in all three subtypes of EMT (see In vivo criteria for EMT).
Biomarkers of EMT
A variety of biomarkers have been used to demonstrate all three
subtypes of EMT. Here we examine a few of the more common
markers,some of which are acquired and some of which are atten￾uated during transition (Table 1).
Cell-surface markers of EMT. A change in expression of E-cadherin
is the prototypical epithelial cell marker of EMT. E-cadherin is
expressed in epithelial cells, and its expression is decreased dur￾ing EMT in embryonic development, tissue fibrosis, and cancer
(65). Moreover, loss of E-cadherin function promotes EMT (4,
66). In recent years, changes in the level of expression of dif￾ferent cadherins, so-called cadherin switches, have been increas￾ingly used to monitor EMT. Indeed, the cadherin switch from
E-cadherin to N-cadherin, which is expressed in mesenchymal
cells, fibroblasts, cancer cells, and neural tissue, has often been
used to monitor the progress of EMT during embryonic devel￾opment and cancer progression. In addition, because OB-cad￾herin is a more definitive marker for activated fibroblasts, an
E-cadherin–OB-cadherin switch is of interest for type 2 EMT
associated with fibrogenesis (67).
EMT is associated classically with a relocation of cells from a
basement membrane microenvironment into a fibrillar ECM. A
change in the level of expression of different integrins (an integ￾rin switch) often reflects alterations in cell-ECM interactions. In
addition, integrin signaling facilitates EMT (68, 69), and various
integrins are expressed on both epithelial and mesenchymal cells.
As a result, integrins in general have limited utility as generalized
biomarkers for EMT. There are, however, examples where integ￾rins can be used as EMT markers in a context-dependent manner.
In colon carcinoma, only cancer cells that have undergone type 3
EMT to a metastatic phenotype express high levels of β6 integrin
(normal epithelial cells and noninvasive cancer cells have low-level
expression) (70). During gastrulation, type 1 EMT is associated
with de novo expression of α5β1, which is a receptor for fibronec￾tin (71). Similarly, type 2 EMT in experimental kidney fibrosis is
associated with increased α5 integrin expression (72). Increased
expression of α5 integrin also correlates with the metastatic poten￾tial of B16F10 melanoma cells and EMT (73), suggesting that α5
integrin plays a role in each subtype of EMT.
Another EMT markerthatreflects adaptation to the altered ECM
microenvironment associated with EMT is the collagen-specific
receptortyrosine kinase DDR2 (discoidin domain receptortyrosine
kinase 2) (74). Upon binding to type I or type X collagen, DDR2
mediates upregulation of MMP1 and cell motility (74, 75). In adult
tissues, expression of DDR2 is confined to subsets of fibroblasts
and vascular smooth muscle cells, whereas de novo expression of
DDR2 in endothelial cells is associated with type 2 EMT (47, 76).
DDR2 expression in cancer cells correlates with increased invasive￾ness, demonstrating its utility in identifying type 3 EMT (74, 77).
Cytoskeletal markers of EMT. FSP1 is a member of the family of
Ca2+-binding S100 proteins (26). It is a prototypical fibroblast
marker for detecting EMT in cancer and fibrogenesis (20, 45). In
tissue fibrosis, most epithelial cells undergoing type 2 EMT express
FSP1 early in transition to fibroblasts, and lineage tagging in trans￾genic reporter mice reveals that more than one-third of all FSP1+
fibroblastsin fibrotic kidneys and livers are EMT derived (45, 48).In
addition, in models of cancer, metastatic cells often express FSP1 as
part of the molecular program of type 3 EMT (20). Ectopic expres￾sion of FSP1 itself facilitates EMT in adult epithelial cells and can￾cer cells (20, 45, 53). In embryonic development, FSP1 is expressed
from E8.5 in the mouse, well after mesenchymal cells first appear
(26). Because FSP1 is mainly confined to transitioning epithelial
cells and fibroblasts as opposed to primitive mesenchymal cells, it
has limited utility for detection of type 1 EMT.
A controversial marker of EMT is the intermediate filament
vimentin, which is expressed in various cells, including fibroblasts,
endothelial cells, cells of the hematopoietic lineages, and glial cells
(78, 79). During embryonic development in the mouse, vimentin
is first expressed at E6.5–E7.0, and it is used as a marker for type
1 EMT during gastrulation (80, 81). However, because adult epi￾thelial cells transiently express vimentin in response to various
insults(82), vimentin should not be considered a marker of type 2
EMT in the setting of fibrosis. By contrast, vimentin is commonly
used to identify cells undergoing type 3 EMT in cancers (63, 83).
Thisis based on a positive correlation of vimentin expression with
increased invasiveness and metastasis (84).
α-SMA is one of six actin family members. In the adult, promi￾nent α-SMA expression can be found in vascular smooth muscle
cells and myoepithelial cells(85). During embryonic development,

the EMT that givesrise to the endocardial cushion is characterized
eventually by de novo α-SMA expression (86). Type 2 EMT, which
contributes to tissue fibrosis, is also sometimes associated with
cells that eventually express α-SMA as myofibroblasts. Although
some of these cells that express both α-SMA and FSP1 are known
as myofibroblasts, most α-SMA+ cells express only α-SMA and are
quite distinct from EMT-derived fibroblasts (43, 47, 51). In can￾cer, evidence that type 3 EMT is associated with α-SMA is mostly
confined to breast cancer (87), where α-SMA largely is detected in
breast tumors of the “basal phenotype” (88).
β-Catenin is a cytoplasmic plaque protein that plays a dual role
in EMT: it links cadherins to the cytoskeleton and serves as a
cotranscriptional activator together with T cell factor (TCF)/LEF
(89). β-Catenin activity is mainly regulated by mechanisms con￾trolling the level of β-catenin in the cytoplasm, through either its
recruitment to cadherin-binding partners or ubiquitination and
subsequent degradation (90). The β-catenin/TCF/LEF complex
directly controls gene expression associated with EMT, particular￾ly Snail1 (91). β-Catenin has been used as a marker of EMT in vari￾ous studies of embryonic development, cancer, and fibrosis (4, 35,
92). Although β-catenin is localized to cell membranes in normal
epithelial cells and noninvasive tumor cells, it is located either in
the cytoplasm (something that is reflective of dissocia￾tion from E-cadherin) or in the nucleus(something that
is reflective of its role as a transcriptional activator) in
cells that undergo EMT (35).
Extracellular proteins. Fibronectin is a high-molecular￾weight glycoprotein that serves as a scaffold for fibril￾lar ECM (93). Because it is one of the first molecules to
appearwhen the fibrillar ECM isformed, it has been used
as an indicator of type 1 EMT associated with gastrula￾tion, palate fusion, and neurulation (94). Even though
fibronectin is an integral constituent of the fibrotic
ECM associated with tissue fibrosis and the desmoplas￾tic stroma in tumors, the utility of fibronectin as a type
2 and type 3 EMT biomarker is limited, in part, because
it is produced by various cell types, including fibroblasts,
mononuclear cells, and epithelial cells(95, 96). Both type
2 and type 3 EMT, however, are associated with increased
fibronectin expression in vitro (67, 97).
Of the principal basement membrane constituents
— type IV collagens, laminin, nidogen, and sulfated
proteoglycans — that are downregulated during EMT,
laminin is best established as a biomarker of the pro￾cess. Laminins are heterotrimeric glycoproteins com￾posed of one α chain, one β chain, and one γ chain
(98). Currently, 15 different heterotrimers are known
(98). With regard to EMT, most studies focus on lam￾inin1 (α1β1γ1), which is present in the embryo from
the peri-implantation period forward (99). Type 1
EMT during gastrulation and palate fusion is marked
by loss of laminin1 (100). Both type 1 and type 2 EMT
are associated with downregulation of laminin1 in
vitro and disruption and loss of laminin1 in vivo (88,
101). By contrast, upregulation of laminin 5 (α3β3γ2)
is associated with type 3 EMT in cancer and type 2
EMT in tissue fibrosis. Laminin5 is detected in the
discontinuous laminin patterns associated with inva￾sive cancers, and its expression is linked to type 3 EMT
in breast carcinomas of the ductal type (102), hepato￾cellular carcinoma (103), and oral squamous carcinoma (104).
Similarly, laminin5 is part of the fibrotic ECM associated with
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (105). A correlation between lam￾inin5 and EMT in the embryo has not yet been reported.
Transcription factors. Fibroblast transcription site–1 (FTS-1) is
a cis-acting regulatory element present in the promoter region
of various EMT-associated genes, including those that encode
FSP1, Twist, Snail1, high mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2),
LEF1, Ets-1, E-cadherin, β-catenin, ZO-1, α-SMA, and vimentin.
CBF-A and KRAB-associated protein 1 (KAP-1) form a complex
with FTS-1 to modulate gene activity. Formation of the CBF-A/
KAP-1/FTS-1 complex induces type 2 EMT in kidney tubular
epithelial cells (54). De novo expression of CBF-A, a member
of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A/B (hnRNP
A/B) family, can be observed in type 2 and type 3 EMT associ￾ated with onset of fibrosis (54) and metastatic tumor formation
(42). However, its expression is not confined to EMT, and it is
involved in various other processes, including stimulation of Ig
transcription (106). KAP-1 is also a ubiquitously expressed tran￾scriptional corepressor or activator that is well known to bind
KRAB domains on zinc finger proteins (106). In EMT, under the
limited circumstances where it has been studied, KAP-1 seems

to be an activator and, in the CBF-A/KAP-1/FTS-1 complex, a
proximal master activator of EMT-associated genes (54).
The number of environmental factorsthat are known to induce
EMT, including growth factors, ECM constituents, proteases,
and hypoxia, is increasing. Despite the distinct nature of known
stimulants, the EMT response is relatively uniform. This raises
interest in potential key regulators of EMT that are at the inter￾section of various signaling pathways and control the EMT
response. Snail transcription factors are one prominent example
of a common downstream target of various signaling pathways
that regulates EMT (61). Of the three vertebrate Snail family
members of zinc finger proteins (Snail1, Snail2, and Snail3), the
functionally equivalent Snail1 and Snail2 (which was formerly
known as Slug) mediate EMT (61). In fact, all known EMT events
during development, cancer, and fibrosis appear to be associated
with Snail activation (61).
Snail is most widely recognized as a suppressor of E-cadherin
expression, but it regulates various other aspects of the EMT
phenotype, such as increased expression of mesenchymal cell/
fibroblast markers (fibronectin and vitronectin), decreased
expression of various epithelial markers (claudins, occludins,
and cytokeratins), inhibition of proliferation through sup￾pression of cyclin D proteins and cyclin-dependent kinase 4
(CDK4), increased MMP expression, and protection from cell
death (through suppression of expression of caspases, DNA
fragmentation factor, and Bcl-interacting death agonist). Snail
transcriptional activity is regulated by control of its subcellular
localization. Phosphorylation of Snail causes it to be exported
from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, resulting in its inactiva￾tion as a transcription factor. In human renal biopsies, fibrosis
is associated with increased Snail1 expression (107), and Snail
activation in tamoxifen-inducible Snail1-transgenic mice results
in type 2 EMT and renal fibrosis (107).
Twist is a basic helix-loop-helix protein that is transcriptionally
active during lineage determination and cell differentiation. It is
upregulated during early embryonic morphogenesis (108, 109),
tissue fibrosis (54, 110), and cancer metastasis (63, 97, 111). In
the development of metastatic cancer cells by type 3 EMT, Twist
can act independently of Snail to repress E-cadherin (63) and to
upregulate fibronectin and N-cadherin (97).
Forkhead box C2 (FOXC2) is another transcription factor that
acts as a pleiotropic inducer of EMT. During embryonic devel￾opment, FOXC2 is widely expressed and is required for angio￾genesis, musculogenesis, and organogenesis of the kidney, heart,
and urinary tract (112, 113). Postnatally, expression of FOXC2 is
normally restricted to adipocytes (114). However, FOXC2 is also
expressed in ductal breast cancers and metastatic breast cancer
cell lines (115). Overexpression of any one of the EMT inducers
TGF-β1, Snail, Twist, or Goosecoid increases FOXC2 expression,
and overexpression of FOXC2 itself induces EMT, suggesting
an important role for FOXC2 in type 3 EMT (115). A role for
FOXC2 in EMT associated with embryogenesis or fibrosis has
not been established yet.
Epigenetic EMT and microRNAs
By the time type 2 EMT finishes, there is a complete switch of cel￾lular phenotype (4). There is a window, however, in which it can
be reversed by pharmacological doses of BMP-7 (55). In epithelial
cancers, genetic mutations typically accumulate to produce a pri￾mary tumor nodule. Since the act of metastasis often results in
secondary tumor nodules, it is highly likely that metastatic cells
generated by type 3 EMT are also reversible in the right tissue and
under a new biologic context (19, 20). The hypothesisthat epigen￾etic modifications mediate such bidirectional transitions (EMT
and MET)raisesthe possibility of an “epigenetic EMT” as opposed
to “genetic EMT”; the precise role of epigenetic modifications in
type 3 EMT is only now receiving attention (116). In addition, two
recent microRNA array analyses have identified microRNAs of the
miR-200 family as markedly downregulated in TGF-β1–induced
EMT and in cancer cell lines that displayed an EMT phenotype
(117, 118). Both studies demonstrate that miR-200 microRNAs
target the E-cadherin transcriptional repressors zinc finger E-box
binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) and ZEB2 (117, 118). Moreover,
miR-200 microRNAs are downregulated in ductal and meta￾plastic breast cancers (117). Conversely, TGF-β1–induced EMT
involving keratinocytes is associated with induction of miR-21
(119) and Twist-induced EMT involving breast cancer cells is
associated with induction of miR-10b (120). The precise role of
microRNAs in regulating all subtypes of EMT will undoubtedly
emerge with more work.
Conclusions
We suggest that EMT can be parsed into three subtypes that all
share a common mechanism. Somatic cells undergoing EMT are
fated to move, and the newly acquired potential to migrate offers
subtle evidence of a previous EMT event. When movement and
cytoskeletal morphogenesis cannot be detected easily, changes
in plasticity biomarkers of EMT are useful for the recognition of
these phenotypic transitions. At the moment, the greatest prom￾ise for identifying this interesting phenomenon lies in analyzing
a collection of markers — in effect, a collection of protein signa￾tures. It is likely that all three subtypes of EMT will share part of
a signature, but some aspects of the signature may be unique to
a particular subtype. The most visible protein signatures include
at least one changing cytoskeletal protein, transcription factor,
adherence protein, and perhaps the changing levels of discrete
microRNAs. It may come to pass that investigators will need to
validate the presence of a common signature for EMT while char￾acterizing the unique features of a particular subtype event. We
hope that this approach may someday advance the possibility of
identifying unique molecular instructions that will be good tar￾gets for subtype regulation.
