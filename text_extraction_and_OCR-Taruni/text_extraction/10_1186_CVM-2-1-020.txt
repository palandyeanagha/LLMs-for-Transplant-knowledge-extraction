Introduction
Heart failure medical therapy has undergone drastic evolu￾tion in the past 15 years. The shift in our understanding of
how to optimally treat this clinical syndrome has been only
slightly less dramatic than the shift in conceptual thought
effected by the Polish astronomer Nicolas Copernicus
(1473–1543), after whom the COPERNICUS trial is named.
Copernicus proposed, based on his observations, the
concept of a heliocentric solar system, as opposed to the
previously accepted Ptolemiac theory of the earth as a fixed
mass in the universe. The theory of giving a beta-blocker, a
negatively inotropic and chronotropic agent, to a heart failure
patient was perhaps as counter-intuitive and revolutionary as
was Copernicus’ heliocentric solar system, inasmuch as
when first proposed it did not fit the accepted paradigm of
the day. Only through years of small mechanistic studies
and, ultimately, through large clinical trials has the old ‘hemo￾dynamic’ paradigm of heart failure treatment fallen. Current
theory now proposes that multiple compensatory neurohor￾monal, cytokine and mechanical stretch signals activate intra￾cellular pathways that lead to progressive myocardial
dysfunction, pathologic hypertrophy and remodeling, and cell
loss [1]. Inhibition of neurohormonal activation by
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors [2,3] or
beta-blocking agents [4–8] has shown an attenuation or
reversal in the pathological remodeling process [9,10], a
shift in phenotype back towards normal [11], and even a
reduction in cell death [12]. Furthermore, clinical trials with β￾blockers conducted in mild to moderate heart failure popula￾tions have shown a consistent mortality benefit, with large
reductions in cardiovascular death, reductions in hospitaliza￾tion, and improvement in quality of life [4–6].

Abstract
Previous trials (Metoprolol CR/XL Randomised Intervention Trial in Congestive Heart Failure [MERIT-HF],
Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study [CIBIS] II) have demonstrated a mortality benefit of β-adrenergic
blockade in patients with mild to moderate heart failure. The recent Carvedilol Prospective Randomized
Cumulative Survival (COPERNICUS) trial has extended these results to a more advanced patient
population. This trial did not, however, include patients who could not reach compensation, patients with
far advanced heart failure symptoms, or a significant number of black patients. Future studies of
β-blockade may focus on these patients or patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction.

Basic design of the COPERNICUS trial
It was unclear prior to the COPERNICUS trial [7] whether
patients with advanced heart failure would derive a benefit
from beta-blockade, as these are the patients who are most
dependent on adrenergic support. The COPERNICUS trial
was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of
the effect of carvedilol, a nonselective beta-blocker with
alpha1 blocking properties and anti-oxidant effects on mor￾tality in patients with more advanced heart failure. To be ran￾domized in this trial, a patient had to have heart failure
symptoms of heart failure at rest or on minimal exertion for at
least 2 months. While New York Heart Association (NYHA)
class was not assessed in this trial, these criteria fit the
NYHA class III or IV criteria. Patients also had to have an
ejection fraction of 0.25 or less, and had to be on ACE
inhibitors and diuretics for at least 2 months. Importantly,
patients with more than minimal evidence of fluid reten￾tion (pulmonary or peripheral edema) were excluded, as
were patients in the intensive care unit, and patients who
had recently received class IV diuretics or inotropes
within 4 days.
Results of the COPERNICUS trial
As the COPERNICUS trial has only been presented orally,
the results presented here are preliminary. The COPERNI￾CUS trial recruited 2289 patients from 152 sites who were
randomized to carvedilol (n = 1156) or placebo (n = 1133)
and were followed for a mean of 316 days [7]. In the United
States, 482 patients were randomized at 117 sites, and
only 121 patients in the COPERNICUS trial were black.
The study was stopped early for a highly significant mortality
benefit. Carvedilol reduced mortality by 35% (95% confi￾dence interval, 19–48% reduction) and the annual placebo
mortality in this study was 18.5%, suggesting an advanced
heart failure population. Subgroup analysis showed a con￾sistent benefit across all strata, and permanent treatment
withdrawal was lower in the carvedilol group than in the
placebo group, suggesting good tolerability of carvedilol.
Commentary
The COPERNICUS study confirms the findings of earlier
trials [4–6] that had demonstrated a benefit of β-blocking
agents in patients with mild to moderate heart failure and
extends the spectrum of eligible patients for this therapy to
a more advanced population. One previous trial, the β￾Blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial (BEST) [8], had exam￾ined a population of advanced heart failure and failed to
demonstrate a benefit in the population as a whole. In this
previous study, however, nonblack patients had a signifi￾cant benefit while black patients did not, and patients with
NYHA class IV heart failure did not demonstrate a benefit.
The failure of BEST to demonstrate a benefit in advanced
heart failure as compared with COPERNICUS may be
related to both the population studied (BEST had many
more blacks and had no requirement for euvolemia) and
the drug used (bucindolol versus carvedilol).
With regard to the population studied, most of the patients
recruited into the COPERNICUS trial as well as the other
positive β-blocker trials were white European patients
[4–7]. This population thus appears to respond well to β￾blockers, while a more heterogeneous population in the
United States may have responded less well. In BEST, 627
black patients followed for almost 2 years were recruited
[13,14]. As BEST stratified by race (black versus non￾black), there was good balance between the placebo and
bucindolol groups at baseline within the black population.
After 208 deaths (94/305 placebo deaths and 114/322
bucindolol deaths), there was no clear benefit of bucindolol
in this group of patients. The COPERNICUS trial only
recruited 121 black patients, among which 7 of 63 black
placebo patients died and 4 of 58 black carvedilol patients
died (hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% confidence interval,
0.18–2.05) [7]). While it is encouraging that the mortality
goes in the correct direction with carvedilol, the certainty of
this finding is low because the confidence intervals are very
wide. An analysis of black patients in all the large β-blocker
trials does not, in fact, show a clear benefit of this therapy
in the black population (Fig. 1).
While the COPERNICUS trial shows a mortality benefit in
an advanced heart failure population, it is important to
examine what patients were actually enrolled in this study.
The COPERNICUS trial represents a euvolemic set of
patients with a low ejection fraction, and symptoms that
would conventionally be classified as NYHA class III or IV.
The low cutoff for ejection fraction in the COPERNICUS
trial almost certainly increased the mortality compared
with other trials that used a higher ejection fraction enroll￾ment criterion, in view of the powerful negative effect of
left ventricular ejection fraction on mortality [15]. While the
MERIT-HF study randomized a less advanced population
of patients with mild to moderate heart failure, a post hoc
analysis of patients within that study who were NYHA
class III (90%) or class IV (10%) and had a left ventricular
ejection fraction ≤0.25, inclusion criteria similar to the
COPERNICUS trial, increases the annual placebo mortal￾ity in MERIT-HF from 11.0 to 19.1% (Wikstrand J, per￾sonal communication, 2000) [16]. Although MERIT-HF
was not designed to recruit patients with advanced heart
failure, the elimination of NYHA class II patients and
patients with an ejection fraction > 0.25 results in a popu￾lation with a higher placebo mortality than COPERNICUS
(19.1% versus 18.5%). The elevation in placebo mortality
is thus not necessarily due to clinical severity of heart
failure, but rather is partly the function of a low ejection
fraction cutoff. The 26% mortality at 6 months in the ACE￾inhibitor arm of the Cooperative North Scandinavian
Enalapril Survival Study (CONSENSUS) trial [17] and the
37% mortality at 6 months in the ACE-inhibitor alone arm
of the The Flolan International Randomized Survival Trial
(FIRST) trial [18] clearly demonstrate that there are NYHA
class IV patients who have much more advanced heart

failure than those recruited in the COPERNICUS trial.
COPERNICUS does not address the benefits of β-blocker
therapy in these populations.
While the COPERNICUS patients have advanced heart
failure, they were also selected for the ability to achieve
compensation. The patients who can achieve compensa￾tion are most probably those who have contractile reserve,
while those without contractile reserve are more clinically
ill. Patients with contractile reserve have the best hemody￾namic response to β-blocker therapy, while those without
contractile reserve have little or no improvement in ejec￾tion fraction [19,20]. This is important because a worsen￾ing of ejection fraction may relate to a neutral or even an
adverse mortality benefit with β-blockade [21]. The mean
systolic blood pressure of 123 mmHg in the COPERNI￾CUS trial, which is higher than that seen in other trials of
class IV heart failure [17,18], also suggests the presence
of contractile reserve. The investigators, by specifying that
only euvolemic patients are allowed in the COPERNICUS
trial, may thus have selected out the most sick (class IV)
patients who would not benefit from β-blocker therapy.
As the COPERNICUS trial did not assess NYHA func￾tional class during the study, it is also clear that COPER￾NICUS provides no direct information relative to the
question of whether β-blockers can be used in class IV
heart failure. A meta-analysis of mortality in NYHA class IV
heart failure subgroups from CIBIS II, MERIT-HF, and
BEST are presented in Figure 2. While it is clear that the
answer for class IV is still unclear, the hazard ratios in
class IV of less than 1.0 in many of these trials suggest
that some (but not necessarily all) class IV patients will
benefit. Because the annual placebo mortality in MERIT￾HF class IV patients was 25% and that in BEST was 28%,
it is clear that COPERNICUS was not comprised of sub￾jects comparable with class IV heart failure. Much of the
benefit of COPERNICUS may accordingly have been in
patients who would be conventionally assessed as NYHA
class III (symptoms on mild exertion) as opposed to those
who were class IV (symptoms at rest or with any activity).
Another reason for the difference between BEST and the
COPERNICUS trial may relate to the sympatholytic effect
of bucindolol [22]. Bucindolol reduced systemic norepi￾nephrine in BEST [13,22], which is presumably the result
of its potent β2-receptor blocking activity [8,13,22,23].
Although carvedilol also blocks β2 receptors at target final
doses, the baroreceptor unloading and/or presynaptic
effects on norepinephrine release of full α1-blockade pre￾vents carvedilol from reducing systemic norepinephrine
levels and probably mitigates the effects of carvedilol on
lowering cardiac adrenergic drive [23]. One other agent
that lowers systemic (as well as cardiac) adrenergic drive
has been recently evaluated in a heart failure clinical trial,
and this agent, moxonidine, increased mortality [24]. It
could thus be that excessive loss of β-adrenergic drive at
the levels of both neurotransmitter release and receptor
blockade becomes a liability in certain heart failure popula￾tions who are critically dependent on adrenergic support.
This may be especially important in the black population in
BEST who tended to have the largest reduction in plasma
norepinephrine with bucindolol therapy [13] and who had
the worst ventricular function at baseline (ie are most
dependent on adrenergic support) [13].
Based on the results of the COPERNICUS study and
other recently conducted β-blocker heart failure trials, it is
important to consider where the database is robust
enough to ethically preclude further placebo-controlled
trials, and in what populations further controlled trials need
to carried out. The role of either second or third generation
β-blocking agents in far advanced heart failure (class IV or
subjects moving between class IIIb and IV) is, in our view,
still unclear, and further placebo-controlled trials are justi￾fied. Based on the BEST data, the role of β-blocking
agents in blacks with advanced heart failure is also unre￾solved. There is also virtually no data in the setting of class
I–II heart failure, which is a population analogous to that
studied in the SOLVD Prevention Trial [25]. Although the
soon to be reported CAPRICORN trial will provide infor￾mation on a postmyocardial infarction left ventricular dys￾function population, this is a decidedly different patient

population from that investigated in the SOLVD Preven￾tion trial. Established asymptomatic left ventricular dys￾function with no or mild symptoms is therefore another
population where placebo-controlled trials are justified
and needed.
Conclusions
The COPERNICUS study is a very important clinical trial
that has added significant support to the β-blocker
hypothesis and reassures us of the safety and benefit of
these drugs in a subset of patients with more advanced
heart failure. It would, however, be inappropriate to over￾extend the findings of the COPERNICUS trial to advanced
heart failure patients who lack potential for reversal and
are not in a compensated state.
