Abstract
Background and Aims: To better understand nonalcoholic
steatohepatitis (NASH) disease progression and to evaluate
drug targets and compound activity, we undertook the devel￾opment of an in vitro 3D model to mimic liver architecture and
the NASH environment. Methods: We have developed an in
vitro preclinical 3D NASH model by coculturing primary hu￾man hepatocytes, human stellate cells, liver endothelial cells
and Kupffer cells embedded in a hydrogel of rat collagen on a
96-well plate. A NASH-like environment was induced by ad￾dition of medium containing free fatty acids and tumor ne￾crosis factor-a. This model was then characterized by
biochemical, imaging and transcriptomics analyses. Results:
We succeeded in defining suitable culture conditions to main￾tain the 3D coculture for up to 10 days in vitro, with the lowest
level of steatosis and reproducible low level of inflammation
and fibrosis. NASH disease was induced with a custom me￾dium mimicking NASH features. The cell model exhibited the
key NASH disease phenotypes of hepatocyte injury, steatosis,
inflammation, and fibrosis. Hepatocyte injury was highlighted
by a decrease of CYP3A4 expression and activity, without loss
of viability up to day 10. Moreover, the model was able to
stimulate a stable inflammatory and early fibrotic environ￾ment, with expression and secretion of several cytokines. A
global gene expression analysis confirmed the NASH induc￾tion. Conclusions: This is a new in vitro model of NASH dis￾ease consisting of four human primary cell-types that exhibits
most features of the disease. The 10-day cell viability and
cost effectiveness of the model make it suitable for medium
throughput drug screening and provide attractive avenues to
better understand disease physiology and to identify and
characterize new drug targets.

Introduction
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an umbrella term
that comprises a large spectrum of liver injuries, varying in
severity but all leading to fibrosis. Among these, nonalcoholic
fatty liver (NAFL) refers to hepatic steatosis alone, which is
very common1 and driven by the accumulation of intracellular
lipid droplets. Furthermore, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH) is defined as a more serious pathogenesis, having
inflammatory foci, hepatocyte damage, and fibrosis.
Adverse hepatic outcomes related to NASH may include cir￾rhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma.2 NAFLD is
associated with obesity and features of metabolic syndrome,
including hypertension, dyslipidemia, central adiposity,
insulin resistance, or diabetes.3,4 Moreover, NASH with
advanced fibrosis has been linked to increased overall and
liver-related mortality.5
Today, bariatric surgery is the most efficient procedure to
reverse NASH and fibrosis in obese patients.6 Weight loss
induced by diet and exercise has also been shown to be effec￾tive in resolving NASH and improving hepatic fibrosis.7
Despite a marked increase in prevalence, though NASH is
still an orphan disease, with no approved drugs for its treat￾ment. Thus, a better management approach for NAFLD and
the development of new drugs and therapeutic options are
urgently needed.8 Although there has been steady progress
in understanding NASH pathogenesis, the identification of
therapeutic targets and the advancement of drug develop￾ment have shown limited progress, mainly due to the lack
of predictive preclinical models. Several animal models have
been developed to study NAFL and NASH, but they do not
accurately depict the human pathology, presumably
because of NAFL/NASH heterogeneity.9
In drug discovery, hepatic in vitro models have been used
to assess drug clearance and hepatotoxicity by investigating
metabolism, enzyme induction, and transporter function.
Monolayer cultures of isolated primary rat or human hepato￾cytes remain the main investigative tools for drug testing.
These 2D models have shown several limitations, including
a short lifetime and loss of function, likely resulting from
dedifferentiation of primary hepatocytes (PHH).10 Precision￾cut liver slices, which contain PHH as well as liver nonparen￾chymal cells have also shown reduced lifetime; thus, impair￾ing the development of liver chronic disease models and
robust drug testing.

More recently, 3D cultures have been developed to
improve cell survival and to provide a more natural tissue-like
environment. In the liver, the extracellular matrix (ECM)
behaves as a scaffold for surrounding cells, and in vitro artificial
matrix aims to support ECM functions by promoting cell adhe￾sion, cell differentiation, and cell-to-cell communication.11–13
3D cultures of hepatic cell lines or human PHH embedded in
artificial scaffolds were shown to modify gene and cell surface
receptor expression toward more mature-like phenotypes,
resulting in the maintenance of hepatocyte polarization and
functionality. Furthermore, it has been shown that collagen
gels enhanced mechanical properties with good cell adhesion
and a high survival rate for hepatocytes.10 Thus, the 3D cell
culture systems appear to be more representative of hepatocyte
physiology in liver tissue and provide opportunities to develop
extended in vitro models of NASH and NAFLD.
The development of in vitro human 3D models to mimic liver
architecture has been undertaken by several groups, especially
for drug safety assessment.14 The process has included layered
cocultures and cocultures on micropatterned surfaces, sphe￾roids and bioprinted liver tissue.14 Many of these models have
been grown within specialized microfluidic devices, to provide
nutrients and oxygen transport.14 Few 3D coculture studies
have been designed as NAFL or NASH disease models to
display key pathogenic phenotypes. Thus, steatosis has been
observed in NAFLD models supplemented with high concentra￾tions of oleic and palmitic acids. Increased lipid accumulation
was found to be associated with altered gene expression and
activity of several CYP450 enzymes. Only limited cytokine
release was reported, likely due to the absence of Kupffer
cells (KCs) in these in vitro systems. Therefore, such 3D
models highlighted the need to coculture additional cell types
that could further incorporate features of inflammation and fib￾rosis and better reflect disease progression.
Feaver et al.15 set up a 3D model with PHH, monocyte￾derived macrophages and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in
hemodynamic and transport conditions. Correlations
between the in vitro model and human biopsies were evi￾denced by transcriptomics, lipidomics, and functional analy￾sis. This model requires differentiating monocytes into
macrophages, which is time consuming, and yields only M2
macrophages, a nonphysiological macrophage subpopula￾tion. In addition, this hemodynamic system is unsuitable for
high-throughput screening.
In this paper, we report on a new 3D coculture model
combining PHH with HSCs, sinusoidal endothelial cells (LECs)
and KC. Activated HSCs play a principal role in fibrosis initiation
and development through the production of collagen, while
KCs are involved in liver damage and inflammatory processes.
LECs were more recently shown to play a pivotal role in NAFL/
NASH progression.16 This model was characterized biochemi￾cally and transcriptionally, and displayed some key features of
hepatic injury, steatosis, inflammation, and early fibrosis. Its
10-day cell viability, as well as its reasonable cost-effective￾ness, make it compatible for medium throughput screening
in 96-well plates. This coculture model thus provides a valua￾ble platform to better understand NASH disease progression,
and to evaluate drug targets and compound activity.
Methods
The liver microenvironment under NAFLD and NASH disease
conditions includes many circulating risk factors, which were
incorporated into cell media to promote in vitro NAFLD or
NASH-relevant phenotypes. Those risk factors include high
glucose and insulin concentrations, excess of free fatty acids
and endotoxins. For steatosis induction, free fatty acids (pal￾mitic and oleic acids) were used, which lead to the accumu￾lation of intracellular lipid droplets. This lipotoxic phenotype is
the most commonly used stimuli for NAFLD in vitro models, as
it can also lead to an increase of inflammatory cytokines
levels.17,18 Tumor necrosis factor-a was added to induce the
inflammation process and activate the KCs. Cells were
embedded in a hydrogel of rat collagen in 96-well plates and
the NASH environment was induced by adding a media con￾taining free fatty acids and tumor necrosis factor-a. Consid￾ering the main characteristics of NASH pathology, hepatocyte
injury, steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis were assessed
biochemically and via transcriptomics.
Cell 3D coculture in hydrogels/matrix of collagen
PHH were obtained from Lonza (Walkersville, MD, USA), and
HSCs, KCs and LECs were provided by Samsara (San Diego,
CA, USA). PHH, HSCs and LECs were seeded in red phenol￾free William E medium (A12176; Gibco, Invitrogen Corp.,
Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine
serum, primary hepatocyte thawing and plating supplements
solution (CM3000; ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,
USA) and 1% of a non-essential amino acids solution
(11140050; Gibco).
PHHs, LECs and hepatic stellate primary cells were embed￾ded at 0.5×106
, 0.1×106 and 0.1×106 cells/mL, respectively,
in a half RAFTTM 3D collagen hydrogel (016-0R92; Lonza) in
96-well plates, as recommended by the provider. Cells were
cocultured in DMEM (low-glucose, pyruvate, no glutamine, no
red phenol; 11054; Gibco) supplemented with bovine serum/
free fatty acid-free 0.125% solution (A7030; Sigma-Aldrich,
St Louis, MO, USA), 50 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin
(15140122; Gibco), dexamethasone 0.1 mM, ITS-G 1X
(41400045; Gibco), GlutaMAXTM 1X (35050061; Gibco),
HEPES 15 mM (15630080; Gibco), non-essential amino
acids solution 1X (11140050; Gibco), acid L-ascorbic
2.5 mg/mL (A4403; Sigma-Aldrich) and glucagon 0.1 mg/mL
(G2044; Sigma-Aldrich). This liver coculture medium is
named “healthy media”. After 3 days of culture, the cocul￾tures were incubated either in healthy media or in a media
mimicking the NASH environment and supplemented with
glucose 25 mM (Sigma-Aldrich), oleate acid 40 mM (Sigma￾Aldrich), palmitate acid at 60 mM (Cayman Chemical, Ann
Arbor, MI, USA) and tumor necrosis factor-a 5 ng/mL (Pepro￾Tech, Cranbury, NJ, USA). Healthy and NASH medium were
changed every 2-3 days. At day 6, KCs were added to the
coculture at 0.2×106 cells/mL. Supernatants and embedded
cells were sampled on days 3, 6, 8, 10, 13 and 15 for analysis.
Viability and hepatocyte metabolism
Viability was assessed by measurement of adenosine triphos￾phate using the CellTiter-Glo 3D Assay (G9681; Promega,
Madison, WI, USA). PHH metabolism was measured through
CYP3A4 activity with the Luciferin-IPA CYP3A4-P450 Glo
Assay (V9002; Promega).
3D primary liver cell coculture immunostaining
3D hydrogels were fixed with 4% Paraformaldehyde/phos￾phate-buffered saline for 15 min at room temperature and

immunostainings were performed. PHH cell membrane stain￾ing was performed with a rabbit anti-cytokeratin 18 antibody
(EPR17347, #Ab181597; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and an
Alexa Fluor 594 conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary
antibody (#A11012; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA).
HSCs were stained with a mouse anti-a-smooth muscle actin
antibody (#A5228; Sigma-Aldrich) and an Alexa Fluor 680
conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody
(#A21057; Molecular Probes). KCs were stained with an
FITC conjugated anti-CD68 antibody was used (KP1,
#FCMAB205F; Sigma-Aldrich), nuclei were labeled using
NucBlue live (#R37610; ThermoFisher Scientific). Image
acquisitions were performed with a Leica SP8X confocal
microscope, using ×40 water objective, Z-stack of Z=30 mm
zoom 0.8. 3D reconstitution was performed with IMARIS
software 9.1.2.
Triglyceride content
Triglycerides content was measured on coculture superna￾tants with the PicoProbe Triglyceride Quantification Assay
(K614-100; BioVision Inc., Milpitas, CA, USA). Intrahepatic
lipid droplets were stained with the LipidTox Green probe
(H34475; ThermoFisher Scientific) and PHH cell membrane
with CK18 immunostaining. Images of 3D cocultures were
acquired with a Leica SP8X confocal microscope, using ×40
water immersion objective and a Z-stack of Z=30 mm, zoom
0.8. 3D reconstitution was performed with IMARIS software
9.1.2.
Cytokine/metalloprotease release
The cytokine content in coculture supernatants were meas￾ured using the U-plex Biomarker Human Group 1 Kit
(K15067L-2; MSD Technology, Rockville, MD, USA).
Samples were diluted at 1/4 for IL6, CXCL8 and CCL2
measurement, and no dilution was performed for CXCL10
quantification. The concentration of secreted metalloprotei￾nase MMP2 was quantified with the Human MMP2 Ultra￾sensitive Kit (K151FYC-2; MSD Technology) with a ½ dilution.
Statistical methodology of biochemical parameters
To compare NASH and healthy models, a two-way ANOVA was
performed on each parameter, with group treatment (healthy
or NASH), day and their interaction as fixed-effects factors,
and with experiment and interaction of experiment, group
and day as random effect factors. Comparisons of NASH
versus healthy were provided for each day and no correction
for multiplicity was done. To analyze the kinetics of the
healthy model, a one-way ANOVA was performed on each
parameter, with day as the fixed-effect factor and experiment
and experiment by day as random effect factors. A Bonfer￾roni-Holm’s correction was applied on p-values to compare
the following: day 6 vs. day 3, day 8 vs. day 6, day 10 vs.
day 8 for comparison of both conditions; and day 10 vs. day
13 and day 13 vs. day 15 for healthy time course assessment.
Either a log or rank transformation was applied on studied
parameters, and fold-changes were calculated. For log-trans￾formed variables, the differences estimated from the model
and their confidence intervals were back-transformed by
using an exponential function. For rank-transformed varia￾bles, fold-change and confidence intervals were estimated
by Hodges-Lehmann’s method.
RNA extractions
Hydrogels embedded cocultures containing 0.2×106 cells per
well, were rinsed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline
and stored at -808
C until use. For RNA extraction, two wells
were lysed in a final volume of 700 mL of Qiazol lysis reagent
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Lysates were homogenized using
CK14-2 mL tubes in a Precellys tissue homogenizer instru￾ment (Bertin Instruments, Montigny-le-Bretonneux,
France). The lysates were collected and 140 mL of chloroform
were added, vortexed and centrifuged at 12000 rpm for
15 minutes at 48
C. Recovered aqueous phase was processed
with an on-column DNAse treatment and a RNeasy mini-kit
(Qiagen) as recommended by the provider. RNAs were recov￾ered in 30 mL of RNase-free water. RNA quality was deter￾mined by RNA LabChip with a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent
Scientific Instruments, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Samples with
RNA integrity number >7.4 were further processed and their
concentration was quantified by Xpose spectrophotometer
(Trinean, Unchained labs, France).
RNA libraries and sequencing
RNA-Seq libraries were generated with 15 ng of total RNA.
cDNAs were generated with the SuperScript VILO cDNA
Synthesis Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) and the following
steps for library construction were performed using the
“AmpliSeq for Illumina Transcriptome Human Gene Expres￾sion Panel” according the accompanying reference guide
(Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).
Libraries were quantified and qualified, respectively, by
Qubit (Invitrogen) and Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Libraries were
pooled (equimolar concentration at 4 nM), denatured and
diluted to a final concentration of 1.4 pM. Sequencing was
performed on the Illumina NextSeq500 with NextSeq 500/
550 High Output v2 Kit and sequencing parameters of 2×151
base pair pair-end, dual index (2×8 base pairs).
Generated raw files were converted into FASTQ files and
analyzed on Array Studio (V10.0.1.81; Omicsoft, Qiagen).
Briefly, raw data QC was performed, then a filtering step was
applied to remove reads corresponding to rRNAs as well as
reads having low quality score. Mapping and quantification
were performed using OSA4 [1C] (Omicsoft Sequence
Aligner, version 4).19 Reference Human.B38 genome was
used for mapping and genes were quantified based on
RefSeq gene annotations. Differentially-expressed transcripts
were identified with DESeq2.20 The variable multiplicity being
taken into account and false discovery rate adjusted p-values
calculated with the Benjamini-Hochberg correction.21 Signifi￾cant differentially-expressed genes were defined as p<0.05
after adjustment for false discovery and average fold-change
between condition replicates of >1.8. The differentially￾expressed genes were further analyzed using Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis (Qiagen; https://www.qiagenbioinfor￾matics.com/products/ingenuity-pathway-analysis).22

developing a coculture containing the different cells involved
in the pathogenesis and maintaining it over an extended

period of time in culture to induce this chronic disease. We
developed a 3D coculture with primary cells using the RAFTTM
biological rat collagen hydrogel embedding PHH, HSCs, KCs
and LECs. The addition of LECs as feeder cells in the 3D liver
coculture allowed us to stabilize the model by improving cell
viability from 1 week up to 2 weeks (data not shown). PHH,
HSCs and LECs were seeded in the hydrogel of collagen at a
5:1:1 ratio, respectively, reproducing the human liver ratio,
and cultured in a 96-well plate in a homemade cell culture
media named ‘healthy media’ (Fig. 1A). At day 6, KCs were
added to the coculture since they did not tolerate the embed￾ding process (data not shown) but were able to enter the
hydrogel once formed. Several media, where Obeticholic
acid/Palmitic acid concentrations, glucose concentration and
tumor necrosis factor were varied, were tested to maintain
viability of the four cell types. Only the homemade liver cocul￾ture optimized media, described in the Materials and Methods
section, allowed us to obtain a viable coculture of the four cell
types up to day 10 (Fig. 1B).
To assess the suitability of the model, coculture viability,
cytokine secretion and lipid droplet content were measured
from day 3 to day 15 in four independent experiments. The
human 3D liver coculture at a basal level displayed a good
viability from day 3 to day 15, as reflected by adenosine
triphosphate level (Fig. 2A). PHH CYP3A4 enzymatic function
was evaluated and it remains stable from day 3 up to day 13
(Fig. 2B). Inflammatory cytokines and chemokines IL6,
CXCL8 and CXCL10 were measured in coculture superna￾tants. Basal levels of secreted IL6 and CXCL8 remained
stable from day 3 to day 15, with a nonsignificant increase
at day 8 resulting from the addition of KCs at day 6 (Fig. 2C
and 2D). CXCL10 was almost undetectable before day 8, after
KCs addition, and its secretion in cell supernatants remained
stable from day 8 to day 15 (Fig. 2E). The triglyceride content
of the human liver 3D coculture was quantified, and PHH lipid
droplets were observed by immunofluorescence via Green
LipiTox and a cytokeratin-18 containing (Fig. 2F and 2G,
respectively). A high basal level of triglycerides with no sig￾nificant variation was detected from day 3 to day 15 (Fig. 2F).
This result was correlated with the observation of an impor￾tant intracellular lipid droplet staining in PHH from day 3 to
day 10 (Fig. 2G). Of note is that the PHH triglyceride content
in human liver 3D coculture was higher than expected.
Several media were tested on PHH, including William’s E
media. All of them induced an elevated intracellular lipid
droplet content (Supplementary Fig. 1) for unknown
reasons and the cell coculture showed a lower viability than
the homemade media.
Together, these results support a long-term viability and
the stable expression of NASH-induced key features that can
be directly quantified in the human 3D liver primary coculture
under healthy conditions up to 15 days (Supplementary
Table 1).
A transcriptomic analysis of human 3D liver primary
coculture under the healthy condition was performed. Gene
expression analysis was only performed on samples from
days 3, 8 and 10 (n=3/condition) as the total RNA quantity
extracted at day 13 and day 15 was too low for gene expres￾sion studies.
The expression of genes related to PHH activities, includ￾ing the efflux transporters ABCC2, ABCB1 and ABCB11, was
first investigated. These genes are consistently detected
during the time course of the coculture until day 10 (Supple￾mentary Table 2) as well as UGT1A1, a gene encoding the
phase II UDP-glucuronosyltransferase enzyme, with a fold￾change <2 and/or with a p-value >0.05. Furthermore,
CYP7A1 cytochrome P450 gene was expressed from day 3
to day 10, with no significant difference (Supplementary
Table 2), CYP3A4 expression, which was decreased at day 8
and day 10 compared to day 3, was stable from day 8 to day
10 (Supplementary Table 2) and was previously observed to
be functional from day 3 to day 13 in 3D coculture (Fig. 2B).
Together, these genes reflect the polarization, functionality
and metabolic activity of mature PHH in human 3D liver
primary coculture up to 10 days in vitro.
As expected, the expression of IL6, CXCL8 and CXCL10
inflammatory cytokine genes is observed. IL6 expression was
stable between day 3 and day 10 (Supplementary Table 2),
whereas CXCL8 and CXCL10 were significantly down- and up￾regulated from day 3 to day 8, resulting from the addition of
KCs but which remained stable from day 8 to day 10 (Supple￾mentary Table 2). IL6, CXCL8 and CXCL10 gene expression
results are in line with their secretion observed in 3D cocul￾ture supernatants (Fig2. C, D and E). The expression of

Duriez M. et al: A human cellular NASH model

Col1A1 gene, encoding collagen compounds remained stable
from day 3 to day 10 (Supplementary Table 2), whereas
ACTA2 gene, encoding the a-smooth muscle actin protein,
slightly increased with a 2.8-fold-change and 2.4-fold￾change at day 8 and day 10, as compared to day 3, but
which remained stable from day 8 to day 10 (Supplementary
Table 2). The ACTA2 gene increased from day 3 to day 8,
probably resulting from the addition of KCs since the latter
have been shown previously to activate HSCs through
soluble factors.23 Together, these results showed that HSCs
are not activated by a bystander effect of the coculture under
healthy conditions.
We succeeded in defining suitable culture conditions,
including medium composition and chronological cell addi￾tion, to maintain the four liver primary cell types in 3D
coculture up to 10 days in vitro. Furthermore, these culture
conditions gave the lowest level of steatosis, together with
reliable low levels of inflammation and fibrosis.
Human 3D liver NASH model display PHH injury and
steatosis
The human in vitro 3D NASH model was set up by culturing
the human primary 3D liver coculture with a custom medium
mimicking a NASH-like disease environment added from day
3. This medium contained free oleic and palmitic fatty acids at
100 mM with a 2:3 ratio, as well as tumor necrosis factor-a at
5 ng/mL.
The adenosine triphosphate levels measured in the human
3D liver coculture did not show a significant difference between
the healthy and NASH culture conditions and indicated a good
viability which was maintained until day 10 (Fig. 3A). ABCC2
and ABCB11 gene expressions were not modulated during the
coculture, neither in the NASH nor in the healthy models,
showing a stable PHH mature phenotype up to 10 days in
vitro (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Table 3). Cytochrome P450
CYP3A4, the expression of which is known to be reduced in
NASH, displayed a reduced activity and gene expression in
the NASH model, as compared to healthy coculture but
without reaching statistical significance (Fig. 3C). However,
at day 10, three out the four experiments showed a decreased
CYP3A4 activity (Fig. 3C), which correlated to a reduced gene
expression at day 10 (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Table 3).
PHH steatosis assessed by triglyceride quantification in
coculture did not show significant differences between
healthy and NASH culture conditions (Fig. 4A). Intracellular
lipid droplet staining is observed in both conditions but
without noticeable differences at day 8 and day 10
(Fig. 4B). As mentioned before, PHH display a high basal
level of triglycerides. This feature was observed for all the
media tested, supporting the finding of PHH viability in the
3D collagen matrix and being consistent with biochemical
quantification of steatosis.

Duriez M. et al: A human cellular NASH model

The human in vitro 3D NASH model displayed a similar
stable viability as observed in the healthy 3D liver coculture
model, whereas it showed a decreased CYP3A4 activity in
three out of four experiments. Lipids droplets, characteristic
of steatosis, were observed in both conditions; high basal
level in healthy coculture does not allow detection of an
increase of triglyceride content in NASH conditions.
Human 3D liver NASH model expression of
inflammatory and tissue remodeling factors
The ability of human 3D liver coculture to react to a proin￾flammatory environment was explored next. The secretion of
CXCL8, IL6, CXCL10 and CCL2 in supernatants of healthy and
NASH 3D coculture was examined by quantifying multiplex
assay at days, 6, 8 and 10. Tumor necrosis factor-a (5 ng/mL)
was added to the medium and changed every 2-3 days to
induce an inflammatory process.
IL6 secretion showed a significant 5-fold increase at day 6
in the 3D NASH model, as compared to the healthy condition
(Fig. 5A and Supplementary Table 4), and a significant
increase in gene expression was observed at days 8 and 10
(Fig. 5B). The secretion of CXCL8 was significantly up-regu￾lated in NASH coculture at day 6 and day 8, with a 10.3-fold
and 4.7-fold increase, respectively (Fig. 5A and Supplemen￾tary Table 4). This observation correlated to an up-regulation
in the expression of CXCL8 in 3D NASH coculture from day 8
to day 10, with a respective fold-increase of 13.4 and 14.6
(Fig. 5B). Finally, CXCL10 secretion was also significantly up￾regulated in the 3D NASH model, being 32.5-fold and 22.6-
fold at day 6 and day 10, respectively (Fig. 5A and Supple￾mentary Table 4). A significant 8.7-fold increase of CCL2 at
day 6 was also observed in coculture supernatant in the 3D
NASH model (Fig. 5C and Supplementary Table 3).
The expression of the metalloproteinases MMP2 and MMP9
involved in tissue remodeling and markers of early fibrotic
events was also explored. MMP2 secretion in the human 3D
NASH coculture significantly increased by 1.2-fold, 1.7-fold
and 1.4-fold at days 6, 8 and 10m respectively (Fig. 6A and
Supplementary Table 4), and correlated with a significative
up-regulation in MMP2 gene expression at day 10 (Fig. 6B
and Supplementary Table 3). Finally, MMP9 transcripts signif￾icantly increased both at days 8 and 10, with a 3.2-fold and
6.6-fold change in the NASH environment (Fig. 6C and Sup￾plementary Table 3).
Together, these results show that the human in vitro 3D
NASH model is able to simulate a stable inflammatory and
early fibrotic environment with the secretion of IL6, CXCL8,
CXCL10, CCL2, MMP2 and MMP9 expression, respectively, as
compared to the healthy model.

Human 3D NASH model regulates a gene set related to
pathways involved in NASH development
To better characterize the human in vitro 3D NASH model, a
global gene expression analysis has been performed by RNA￾Seq. For this purpose, three samples from days 3, 8 and 10 of
the healthy 3D cocultures and from days 8 and 10 of the
in vitro 3D NASH model were processed. Global RNA-Seq
datasets from the 3D healthy and NASH models were first
interrogated using a principal component analysis to cluster
these two models during in vitro development (Fig. 7A). A
distinct sample separation was observed between 3D
healthy and NASH models (represented by circles and trian￾gle, respectively, in Fig. 7A), highlighting that NASH culture
condition alters the overall gene expression pattern of 3D
liver cocultures. A time effect on both the healthy and NASH
3D liver model was also visualized, being more noticeable
between days 8 and 10 in the 3D NASH coculture.

Duriez M. et al: A human cellular NASH model

To identify pathways modulated under NASH-inducing
conditions, differentially-expressed genes between 3D
healthy and NASH models were identified. A total of 659
significant differentially-expressed genes were detected
between 3D healthy and NASH conditions at day 8 (Supple￾mentary Fig. 2). A gene subset was already modulated
between day 3 and day 8 in the healthy 3D model and,
thus, could not be assigned to the NASH culture condition.
In the end, we selected 468 differentially-expressed genes
in the 3D NASH model that were not found to be regulated
over time in the healthy model. This list included 351 up￾regulated and 117 down-regulated genes (Supplementary
Fig. 2). A hierarchical clustering analysis of healthy and
NASH 3D liver models using these 468 differentially-expressed
genes confirmed a good separation of the samples from
healthy and NASH 3D coculture conditions (Fig. 7B). In addi￾tion, most of the differentially-expressed genes after 8 days in
vitro are still differentially regulated at day 10.
We ran further pathway analysis of the 468-gene set differ￾entially regulated in NASH conditions. Interestingly, among the
top 18 enriched pathways, genes involved in hepatic fibrosis/
hepatic stellate cell activation were found to be modulated, and
this pathway was ranked in third position (Fig. 7C). The first two
most strongly modulated gene clusters are associated with the
activation of immune cell adhesion and the inflammatory
process via the diapedesis pathways (Fig. 7C).
More precisely, genes encoding for claudin adhesion pro￾teins, together with members of the immunoglobulin super￾family, such as ICAM1, ICAM2 and VCAM1, were up-regulated
(Fig. 8). Other additional up-regulated inflammation/immune
pathways included interferon signaling, IRF activation, tumor
necrosis factor-receptor, and IL17 signaling.

Duriez M. et al: A human cellular NASH model

In conclusion, global gene expression analysis showed
similar results to biochemical analysis. Together with the
steatosis pathways observed under healthy conditions and
maintained in the NASH 3D coculture, inflammation and early
induction of fibrosis were shown to be induced in the human
primary 3D liver NASH model.
Discussion
In our present study, we have set up an in vitro 3D NASH
model by coculturing four human primary liver cell types,
including PHH, HSCs, LECs, and KCs. The major challenge
prior to this had been to develop a medium able to maintain
these four primary cell types in culture, during an extended
period of time, and to preserve the PHH mature phenotype.
Our custom Liver CoCulture media, optimized for 3D
coculture, enabled us to successfully ensure cell viability up
to 2 weeks in vitro. Transcriptomic analyses performed at day
10 indicated that PHH were still polarized and functional, with
the detection of ABCC2, ABCB11, CYP3A4, and CYP7A1 gene
expression.
In NASH, injured steatotic hepatocytes induce an inflam￾matory environment, leading to HSC activation and fibrosis.
Since this mechanism results from hepatocyte ballooning,
reflecting cell death, and the 3D NASH model requires a
sustained viability to perform analysis, an inflammatory
stimulus was provided by adding tumor necrosis factor-a
cytokine to the NASH culture media. PHH injury was mainly
characterized by a decrease of CYP3A4 activity and mRNA
expression at day 10.24
Intriguingly, the 3D liver coculture exhibited high basal
levels of triglycerides, as well as significant lipid droplet
staining related to steatosis. An enrichment of pathways
governing HSC activation and promoting early fibrosis was
also observed. Thus, the human 3D liver coculture model
displays steatosis and an activation of HSC leading to fibrosis,
which are two main characteristics of NAFL/NASH. This model
is able to respond to the inflammatory environment and to
enhance the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, like
IL6, as described in the literature.25,26 Several previous
studies have associated an increased CCL2 chemokine with
steatohepatitis in chronic hepatic injury through an enhance￾ment of proinflammatory monocyte/macrophage influx in the
liver.27–30 Thus, CCL2 is thought to link steatosis and inflam￾mation, and accordingly, its expression is up-regulated in the
human 3D NASH model.
An increase of CXCL8 and CXCL10 was also observed in
the 3D liver NASH model, confirming the induction of an
inflammatory environment, which is a key characteristic of
NASH disease.31 As previously described, CXCL8 could be a
marker of NASH combined with diabetes.32 Recently, Zim￾mermann et al.33 established a positive correlation between
CXCL8 mRNA expression and liver fibrosis stages, showing
that a high level of transcript is found in a mouse model of
severe F4 fibrosis; furthermore, an up-regulation of CXCL8-
binding CXCR1 and CXCR2 receptors was positively corre￾lated with chronic liver diseases. CXCL10 cytokine expression
has also been correlated with fibrosis score.34 The pivotal role
of CXCL10 in NASH has also been shown in vivo using
CXCL10-deficient mice, since a decrease in liver steatosis,
injury, inflammation and fibrosis have been reported in this
model compared to wild-type animals.35
The increase of CXCL10 mRNA and secreted protein in 3D
coculture maintained in the NASH-like environment, together
with the key role of CXCL10 in NASH disease reported in the
literature, underscores the relevance of our human 3D NASH
model.35,36 Fibrogenesis is known to be associated with the
synthesis and the activity of matrix metalloproteases that
regulate ECM turnover during hepatic fibrosis. Among them,
MMP2 and MMP9 are induced in fibrotic livers and are involved
in the early disruption of the ECM in “pathologic” liver. More￾over, up-regulation of MMP2 has been identified in human
fibrotic liver, whereas MMP9 induction has been highlighted
in the rodent NASH model.37–40 Phenotypes that manifest
later in the disease lifetime, such as collagen formation,
have not been observed in this model because of the limited
duration of the coculture.
The translatability of the model is further strengthened
by the differential regulation of the serum endothelial
dysfunction markers, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. These two
markers are of major interest to validate the induced
fibrosis in the NASH model. Indeed, ICAM-1 has been
found to be significantly higher in serum from NASH
patients compared to serum of NAFL and healthy
patients,41 supporting the role of ICAM-1 as a potential
disease progression biomarker. Regarding VCAM-1, it has
also been recently validated as an accurate biomarker of
fibrosis in NASH patients.42 Furthermore, ASK1/MAP3K5

has been largely described in the literature as a pharmaco￾logical target for NASH disease treatment43–45 and, inter￾estingly, its up-regulation is observed in our human 3D
NASH model (Supplementary Table 2).
Finally, PD-L1 (CD274) gene expression was shown to be
enhanced in the human 3D NASH model, and this finding is
relevant for the induction of fibrosis. An up-regulation of the
PD-L1 gene has been described previously in injured liver and
associated with HSC immunomodulatory activity46 and hep￾atocyte damage leading to inflammatory processes.47 The
induction of PD-L1 and PDCD1LG2 in the human 3D NASH
model suggests that this pathway could qualify as an attrac￾tive avenue for NASH treatment.
Several 3D models for NASH have been developed and a
recent comprehensive comparison was reported by Oseini
et al.14 Most of these models are used to measure drug tox￾icity and clearance but do not mimic disease progression.
Few 3D culture systems have been set up for NAFLD
disease modeling. The main features are summarized in
Table 1. For example, liver-on-a-chip and spheroid technol￾ogy have been used with cell lines or primary cell types to
induce steatosis and recapitulate NAFLD. Two different com￾mercial technologies, the TranswellTM from Hemoshear
device and 3D InsightTM Human Liver Microtissues from
InSphero (Table 1, rows 3 & 4), are comparable to our
model in terms of model viability and NASH features.
However, in the Transwell model, it is necessary to differen￾tiate monocytes in macrophages. Furthermore, the use of a
microfluidic system hampers its application for screening
purposes. More recently, Mukherjee et al.48 has developed
a 3D model using 3D Insight Human liver microtissues that is
the closest to the one reported in this paper. With the four
human primary cell types, they described NASH features and
use reference molecules to reverse the disease. However,
transcriptional characterization was not reported. In our
model, the translatability, as typified by NASH transcrip￾tional markers, is more thoroughly defined. Our model is
also distinguished by the fact that embedded endothelial
cells were used. These cells have been shown to play a
pivotal role in NAFLD/NASH progression from the simple
steatosis to the early NASH stage probably by activating
HSCs and KCs.16,18 It has been suggested that coculture of
primary human HSCs and LECs from cirrhotic livers promote
fibrillar collagen production by HSCs. In addition, it is
thought that liver sinusoidal endothelial cells injuries in the
early stage of NAFLD are necessary for the activation of KCs
and HSCs, and therefore for the NAFLD/NASH progression.
In conclusion, we have developed a new 3D NASH model
with four human primary cell types, which include liver
sinusoidal endothelial cells.
Optimization of the model, by using microfluidic devices,
could be an option to increase cell survival and to mimic
chronic disease, but it will likely not be suitable for screening
purposes. Our 3D NASH model could be maintained for 10
days in vitro and showed triglyceride content leading to stea￾tosis, an inflammatory response and activation of fibrosis￾related pathways that are also associated with NASH. The
relative extended life time of the 3D model culture makes it
an attractive platform to evaluate preventive and curative
treatments with drug candidates. These experiments will be
reported in due course.
