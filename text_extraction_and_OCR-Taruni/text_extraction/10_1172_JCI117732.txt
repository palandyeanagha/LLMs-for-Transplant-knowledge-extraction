Abstract
Postischemic filtration failure in experimental animals re￾sults primarily from depression of the transcapillary hy￾draulic pressure difference (AP), a quantity that cannot be
determined in humans. To circumvent this limitation we
determined the GFR and each of its remaining determinants
in transplanted kidneys. Findings in 12 allografts that exhib￾ited subsequent normofiltration (group 1) were compared
with those in 11 allografts that exhibited persistent hypofil￾tration (group 2). Determinations were made intraopera￾tively in the exposed graft after 1-3 h of reperfusion. GFR
(6±2 vs 29±5 ml/min) and renal plasma flow by Doppler
flow meter (140±30 vs 315±49 ml/min) were significantly
lower in group 2 than group 1. Morphometric analysis of
glomeruli obtained by biopsy and a structural hydrody￾namic model of viscous flow revealed the glomerular ultra￾filtration coefficient to be similar, averaging 3.5±0.6 and
3.1±0.2 ml/(min * mmHg) in group 2 vs 1, respectively. Cor￾responding values for plasma oncotic pressure were also
similar, averaging 19±1 vs 21±1 mmHg. We next used a
mathematical model of glomerular ultrafiltration and a sen￾sitivity analysis to calculate the prevailing range for AP
from the foregoing measured quantities. This revealed AP
to vary from only 20-21 mmHg in group 2 vs 34-45 mmHg
in group 1 (P < 0.001). Further morphometric analysis
revealed the diameters of Bowman's space and tubular lu￾mens, as well as the percentage of tubular cells that were
necrotic or devoid of brush border, to be similar in the two
groups. We thus conclude (a) that AP depression is the
predominant cause of hypofiltration in this form of postisch￾emic injury; and (b) that afferent vasoconstriction rather
than tubular obstruction is the proximate cause of the AP
depression. (J. Clin. Invest. 1995. 95:820-831.) Key words:

ate the transplantation, however, requires interruption of blood
flow from the time that the kidney is procured from the donor
until vascular anastamosis to the recipient is complete. To mini￾mize renal injury during this ischemic interval, oxygen-requir￾ing transport processes are slowed by maintaining kidney tem￾perature as close as possible to 4TC. Nevertheless, postischemic
injury to the allograft remains a common complication of the
transplantation procedure (1). Like postischemic injury to the
native kidney, it is characterized by a profound depression of
the GFR. The latter phenomenon results in a failure of the
recipient's azotemia to resolve promptly in the wake of the
transplantation, and is often referred to as delayed graft func￾tion. Unrecognized acute rejection can, of course, also contrib￾ute to delayed graft function, but is seldom an important factor
in the first week after transplant. Thus, as judged by a subse￾quent need to provide dialysis treatment in the first postoperative
week, postischemic allograft injury has been estimated to occur
with an incidence of 30-40%.
Our understanding of the phenomenon of postischemic fil￾tration failure derives largely from the study of experimental
animals, in which blood flow to the native kidney has been
transiently interrupted for between 30 and 60 min. The profound
depression of GFR which follows subsequent reperfusion of the
kidney lasts for seven or more days, and has been attributed
mainly to a decline in the glomerular transcapillary hydraulic
pressure difference (AP).' The initial fall in this outward driv￾ing force for ultrafiltrate formation has been shown to be a
consequence of obstruction of tubules by necrotic cell debris,
with a resultant increase in the upstream hydraulic pressure in
Bowman's space (2-5). Subsequent afferent arteriolar con￾striction has been found to lower glomerular capillary hydraulic
pressure some 24-48 h after reperfusion, thereby depressing
the AP further (2, 5-8).
Because hydraulic pressure cannot be determined in either
the capillaries or the Bowman's space of human glomeruli, it
has not been possible to confirm a GFR-lowering role for re￾duced AP in patients with postischemic renal injury. In an effort
to circumvent this limitation, we have exploited the accessibility
of the exposed and reperfused allograft during transplantation
surgery to determine the GFR and estimate each of its remaining
determinants. We then applied these quantities to a mathemati￾cal model of glomerular ultrafiltration and calculated the level
of AP that is likely to have prevailed during the presence or
absence of postischemic filtration failure.

GFR comprise group 1 (prompt function). 11 kidney transplants exhib￾iting depressed GFR comprise group 2 (delayed function).
Methods
Patient population
23 consecutive patients undergoing renal transplantation at our institu￾tion gave informed consent to a study of allograft function. Each was
studied according to a protocol, which had been approved previously
by the Panel for Research in Human Subjects at Stanford University.
They ranged in age from 18 to 71 yr, and 13 were male. The transplant
was donated by a living parent or sibling in 7 instances and was obtained
from a cadaveric source in the remaining 16 cases. The donors were of
similar age to the recipients, spanning a range of 6 to 65 yr. The GFR,
measured as the clearance of iothalamate on postoperative day 3, was
used to divide the patients into two groups. Group 1 (n = 12) was
comprised of 12 subjects who had a normal age-adjusted GFR for a
single kidney (Fig. 1). Group 2 was comprised of the remaining 11
patients who exhibited marked depression of the GFR, a finding which
was attributed to postischemic injury to the allograft (Fig. 1). To avoid
confounding effects on GFR of cyclosporine, a vasoconstrictor sub￾stance (9, 10), initiation of treatment with this immunosuppressive
agent was withheld until after completion of the iothalamate clearance
on postoperative day 3.
Transplantation procedures
(a) Management of living donors. An extensive preoperative evaluation
was undertaken to ensure that renal function and anatomy were normal
in each living donor. Nephrectomy was performed under isofluorane
anesthesia on the day of transplantation. After dissecting the kidney free
of surrounding fat, the vascular pedicle was isolated and the renal artery
and vein skeletonized. The ureter was dissected down to the level of
the pelvic brim. Clamps were then placed across both vessels and the
ureter, and each structure was transected. The kidney was submerged
in a basin of iced lactated Ringer's solution and the renal circulation
flushed with UW preservation solution until the venous effluent was
clear. Thereafter, the kidney remained in cold storage in the iced Ring￾er's solution until the transplantation 30-60 min later.
(b) Management of cadaveric donors. All cadaveric donors in this
series died of a severe brain injury. Crystalloid fluids and dopamine
(0.1-0.5 jig/kg per min) were infused in an effort to maintain systolic
blood pressure above 90 mmHg and urine flow above 50 ml/h. The
number and duration of hypotensive episodes were recorded. Cadaveric
organ procurement was coordinated by the California Transplant Donor
Network. A neurologist in each participating center diagnosed brain
death using clinical criteria. With the heart still beating, the donor was
taken to an operating room, where the renal circulation was exposed.
To minimize the warm ischemic time, the kidneys were first cooled in
situ by flushing the renal circulation with cold University of Wisconsin
(UW) preservation solution. The kidneys were then removed and stored
in iced UW solution at 40C until transplantation.
(c) Management oftransplant recipients. 18 recipients in the present
series were receiving maintenance hemodialysis therapy and three
chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. The remaining two subjects
(both subsequently members of group 1) were never dialyzed, receiving
their transplantation from living donors when therapy for their end-stage
renal failure became urgent because of a GFR that was estimated to be
well below 10 ml/min. All recipients on maintenance dialysis were
dialyzed within the 24 h preceding the transplantation. Peritoneal dial￾ysis catheters were drained and capped before surgery. Preoperative
levels of creatinine, height, weight, and blood pressure were recorded
in each instance.
General anesthesia was induced with narcotic agents and maintained
with isofluorane. An indwelling bladder catheter and a central venous
line were inserted after induction of anesthesia. The extraperitoneal
space was entered through a lower quadrant abdominal incision. The
external iliac artery and vein were identified, skeletonized for a distance
of 8 cm, and clamped proximally and distally. Methylprednisolone 1 g
and azathioprine (10 mg/kg) were then infused intravenously. The
kidney graft was removed from the iced storage solution and the renal
artery and vein anastamosed end-to-side to the corresponding recipient
iliac vessels. All clamps were then released. The "rewarming time"
(from the end of cold storage until completion of the anastomoses) was
recorded. Mannitol (0.5 g/kg) was infused just before release of the
vascular clamps. Each recipient's bladder was filled with an irrigating
solution containing neomycin, bacitracin, and heparin. The donor ureter
was then spatulated, the recipient bladder mucosa incised, and a uretero￾neocystostomy created. The detrusor muscle was reapproximated over
the ureteroneocystostomy to create an antireflux tunnel. Crystalloid solu￾tions were infused throughout the operative procedure to maintain cen￾tral venous pressure > 10 mmHg.
(d) Postoperative immunosuppression. The immunosuppressive re￾gime for the first 10 days was comprised of antithymocyte globulin
(ATGAM; The Upjohn Co., Kalamazoo, MI), prednisone, and azathio￾prine. The daily ATGAM dose of 20 mg/kg was adjusted downwards
in the event of leukopenia or thrombocytopenia. Prednisone dosage was
tapered from an initial level of 1.5 to 1.0 mg/kg per d. Azathioprine
dosage was similarly tapered from 5 to 2 mg/kg per d. Cyclosporine
therapy was introduced only after the third postoperative day, when
allograft function was judged to be adequate because of a spontaneous
fall in the serum creatinine level to below 3 mg/dl. Body weight, blood
pressure, serum creatinine, and urine output were recorded daily.
Protocol
Evaluation of early allograft function. The GFR and its determinants
were evaluated during the first 3 h after reperfusion of the allograft.
Renal blood flow was determined 45 min after reperfusion by Doppler
flow probe using an ultrasonic transit time flow meter (HT 107; Tran￾sonic Systems Inc., Ithaca, NY). A snugly fitting flow probe of 12-16
mm in diameter was placed around the renal vein. The iliac fossa was
then filled with saline to optimize ultrasonic determinations. Triplicate
determinations were recorded on a precalibrated digital readout at 2-
min intervals. The coefficient of variation between measurements was
15%, and renal blood flow was expressed as the median value of the
three determinations. Mean arterial pressure was simultaneously deter￾mined by dynamap and central venous pressure by transducer. Renal
vascular resistance was calculated by dividing the arterio-venous pres￾sure drop by renal blood flow. Renal plasma flow (RPF) was calculated
from the product of renal blood flow and the fractional hematocrit of
venous blood. 30-ml samples of blood were then drawn from both the
renal vein and the iliac vein for determination of plasma renin activity
and endothelin I levels. Samples were placed in cooled EDTA-coated

polypropylene tubes and centrifuged. The supernatant plasma was re￾moved and stored at -70'C until the day of immunoassay.
Upon completion of the foregoing hemodynamic determinations an
open surgical biopsy was taken from the cortex of the allograft. The
biopsy measured - 6 mm in length, 4 mm in width, and 3 mm in
depth. It was divided into portions for examination by light and electron
microscopy. The portion for light microscopy was fixed in Zenker's
fluid, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. The portion for electron
microscopy was fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde buffered with cacodylate
and postfixed in 2% osmium tetroxide for 60 min. The fixed tissue was
then embedded in epon after passage through a series of graded ethanols.
Once the surgical procedure was complete, the irrigating solution
was rinsed out of the bladder to permit determination of the GFR by
the clearance technique. A 30% solution of iothalamate was given as a
bolus followed by a sustaining infusion to maintain plasma iothalamate
levels constant, as described by us previously (11). After a 60-min
period of equilibration, arterial and venous pressures were determined
and venous plasma sampled for the determination of oncotic pressure
(7rA). Two timed urine collections, each of 30-60 min duration, were
then made via the Foley bladder catheter. Each urine collection was
bracketed by a 10-ml sample of venous blood. Plasma and urine samples
were then assayed for iothalamate and true creatinine levels. Our original
intention to use the iothalamate clearance as the primary measure of
allograft GFR was thwarted by the presence of substances which inter￾fered in the iothalamate assay, presumably anesthetic agents or other
drugs given during the surgical procedure. We accordingly substituted
the clearance of endogenous creatinine as the primary measure of GFR
during this early evaluation of allograft function. Justification for this
substitution was provided by the demonstration that values for the simul￾taneous clearances of creatinine and iothalamate were similar under the
conditions of the present study (Appendix 1). We also determined the
osmolality and sodium concentration of each urine and plasma sample,
and used the urine-to-plasma osmolality ratio and the fractional excre￾tion of sodium (FENa) as indices of tubular function (12, 13).
Evaluation of postoperative allograft function. A mathematical
model of creatinine kinetics was used to calculate the prevailing creati￾nine clearance for each of the first 10 postoperative days ( 14). A more
formal evaluation of renal function was undertaken on the morning of
postoperative day 3, before the Foley bladder catheter was removed. The
clearances of iothalamate, para-aminohippurate (PAH) and creatinine
during four consecutive 30-min urine collections were determined. In￾terfering substances were no longer present in recipient serum at this
time, and the clearance of iothalamate was used as the primary measure
of GFR. Other determinations performed during the day 3 clearance
study included arterial and central venous pressures, 7rA, circulating
levels of endothelin I and plasma renin activity, and the aforementioned
indices of tubular function.
Laboratory determinations. A high pressure liquid chromatography
system with an online ultraviolet light detector was used to assay iothala￾mate and PAH at 263 nm (No. 6A; Instrumentation Shimadzu, Kyoto,
Japan). Ultrafiltrates of plasma and diluted urine were injected onto a
reverse-phase column (No. C18, 5 /tm, Ultrasphere; Beckman Instru￾ments, San Ramon, CA). The mobile phase was 3.5% acetonitrile in
10 mM triethylamine at pH = 3.0 and a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min.
Iothalamate and PAH concentration was determined from the peak area
of each solute, corresponding to column retention times of 14 and 10
min, respectively ( 11). The concentration of creatinine in urine and
plasma was determined by an automated, rate-dependent picrate method
using a creatinine analyzer (analyzer II; Beckman Instruments). This
method minimizes the influence of slow-reacting noncreatinine chromo￾gens and thus provides an estimate of true creatinine concentration.
Osmolality of urine and plasma was measured by freezing point depres￾sion, using an osmometer (model CDII; Advanced Instruments, Inc.,
Needham Heights, MA), while corresponding concentrations of sodium
were determined by flame photometry (Instrumentation Laboratories,
Lexington, MA). The oncotic pressure in venous plasma was taken to
be the same as that entering the glomerular tuft (7rA), and was measured
directly by membrane osmometry using a colloid osmometer (No. 4400;
Wescor Inc., Logan, UT).
Plasma levels of endothelin I were determined by radioimmunoas￾say. Specific antibody was purchased from Peninsula Laboratories (Bel￾mont, CA) and radioiodinated antigen from Amersham Corp. (Arlington
Heights, IL). Endothelin I was extracted from plasma using C18 car￾tridges (Waters Associates, Milford, MA) and an acetonitrile/trifluoro￾acetic acid elution system. The extracts were concentrated to dryness
by evaporation and reconstituted with 0.1 M phosphate buffer containing
1% Triton-100 and 0.1% BSA. A sequential nonequilibrium radioimmu￾noassay was then performed. Radioactivity of the l"I-bound fraction
was measured using a gamma counter (Beckman Instruments). A logit￾log transformed standard curve was then used to calculate the percentage
of endothelin I bound. Plasma renin activity was determined from the
rate of angiotensin I generated at pH = 6.0 using a radioimmunoassay
kit provided by Clinical Assays Inc. (Stillwater, MN).
Morphological studies
(a) Glomerular morphometry. I-,um thick sections of the paraffin-em￾bedded biopsy material were cut and stained with periodic acid Schiff
reagent. A dedicated computer system (Southern Micro Instruments,
Atlanta, GA) consisting of a video camera, monitor, light microscope,
and digitizing tablet was used to perform measurements (15, 16). The
average number of glomeruli examined per biopsy was 25 in group 1 and
32 in group 2. The outline of each Bowman's capsule and glomerular tuft
in the cross-section was traced onto the digitizing tablet at a magnifica￾tion of 900. The cross-sectional areas within Bowman's capsule (ABC)
and of the glomerular tuft (A0) were computed using area perimeter
analysis. The difference between ABC and AG yielded the area of Bow￾man's space (ABs). Glomerular volume (VG) was calculated from AG
and corrected to account for the tissue shrinkage associated with paraffin
embedding, using a linear shrinkage factor (fj) (17).
- 4 d 3A 2 fs3 (1)
where /3 is a dimensionless shape coefficient (/3 = 1.38 for spheres)
and d is a "size distribution coefficient" which is introduced to account
for variations in glomerular size. We used d = 1.1, which corresponds
to a distribution of glomerular sizes with a standard deviation of 25%
of the mean size (17). We have determined that, in our experimental
procedure for tissue fixation, the value of the shrinkage factor is f,
= 0.86.
Toluidine blue-stained 1-pum sections of the epon-embedded mate￾rial were examined to select the two glomeruli closest to the center of
the block. Ultrathin sections (60-70 nm) of these glomeruli were next
cut, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and photographed. A
complete montage of each glomerulus was prepared at a magnification
of 2,820. Point and intercept counting was then used to determine the
peripheral capillary surface area (S), which was defined as the interface
between the peripheral capillary wall and epithelium, and calculated as
S = SvVV (2)
where S, is the surface density of peripheral capillary wall (expressed
as length of peripheral capillary wall per unit cross-sectional area of
glomerulus). Eight electron photomicrographs (xl1,280) were then
obtained from each of the two glomerular profiles to evaluate the thick￾ness of the glomerular basement membrane and frequency of epithelial
filtration slits (18). The harmonic mean basement membrane thickness
(6bm) was calculated for each individual from the measured (apparent)
harmonic mean thickness (6bmj) by
bbm = 8bb 37r

where 8/(3Ir) is a correction factor derived by Jensen et al. (19) to
account for the random angle of sectioning. The filtration slit frequency
(FSF) was determined by counting the total number of slits captured
on the electron photomicrographs and dividing this number by the corre￾822 Alejandro et al.

between filtration slits (W) was computed as

where 2/ir is a correction factor derived by Drumond et al. (18) to
account for the random angle of sectioning.
(b) Tubular morphometry. Abnormalities of tubulo-interstitial struc￾ture were first assessed by light microscopy using l-pam sections stained
with periodic acid Schiff reagent. An 11 x 11 square grid was inserted
into the eye piece of the microscope. Point and intercept counting of
seven grid fields at a magnification of 900 was used to calculate the
cross-sectional area of all tubules in the seven fields, and separately, of
the tubular lumina. Point counting at x60 was also used to calculate
the fraction of cortex occupied by interstitium in each field, where
interstitial area is defined as that outside of tubular and vascular struc￾tures other than peritubular capillaries ( 16). The percentage of proximal
tubular cells which had undergone necrosis was also estimated. Point
counting was used to estimate the number of cells with pyknotic nuclei
in each field, whether such cells were in their normal location or had
sloughed off the tubular basement membrane and entered the tubular
lumen. The loss of tubular brush border was evaluated by electron
microscopy. Undamaged proximal tubules far from the edge of the
biopsy were identified in toluidine blue-stained sections of 1 Ism thick￾ness. Ultrathin sections (60-70 nm) of the selected tubules were placed
on slotted copper grids and photographed at a final magnification of
5,640. The brush border associated with the apical membrane of each
tubular cell was evaluated and classified as normal, diminished, or en￾tirely absent.
Calculations
(a) Glomerular capillary oncotic pressure (7rGc). We computed 7roc
from the arithmetic mean of 7rA and 7rE, which are the respective oncotic
pressures of plasma entering the afferent and efferent arterioles. The 7rA
was assumed to be the same as that measured directly in systemic venous
blood. The 7rE was calculated as follows

inputs used here are identical to those given in Table 1 of Drumond et
al. (18).
(c) Glomerular transcapillary hydraulic pressure difference (AP).
The AP was computed from GFR, RPF, 7rA, and Kf using a slightly
modified version of the glomerular filtration model of Deen et al. (24).
In that model the glomerular capillary network is idealized as a number
of identical capillaries in parallel, and steady state mass balance equa￾tions are used to compute variations in plasma flow rate and protein
concentration with distance along a representative capillary. It was as￾sumed that AP is constant along a capillary. The calculations of AP
was based on an iterative solution of the integral equation
fCE/CA dC
= F
C2(B-AIC-A2C2) (6)
to determine B, defined as B = AP/IrA. The dimensionless constants
in equation 6 are F = Kf 7rA/RPF, A1 = aICA/IrA, and A2 = 1 - Al;
CA and CE are the afferent and efferent protein concentrations, respec￾tively, and C is local protein concentration divided by CA. The afferent
protein concentration was calculated from IrA using
-a
2
-a + a1 + 4a2IrA CA= ~~2a2 (5)
where FF is the filtration fraction. That iroc can be equated with the
arithmetic mean of IrA and IrE assumes a linear rise in oncotic pressure
as plasma flows axially along the glomerular capillaries, an assumption
which we have shown to be accurate to within 0.5 mmHg (20).
(b) Glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient (Kf). The overall Kf for the
transplanted kidney is the product of the glomerular capillary hydraulic
permeability (k) and the total surface area available for filtration in all
glomeruli. The total surface area was computed from the single nephron
value (S, determined as described above) and estimates of the total
number of nephrons. The baseline value of the total number of nephrons
was taken to be 1 x 106 (21). The effective hydraulic permeability
was estimated from the individually measured values of '5bm and mean
distance between filtration slits by using the structural-hydrodynamic
model of Drumond and Deen (22). Briefly, that model approximates
the glomerular capillary wall as consisting of a large number of repeating
structural units, each unit being based on a single filtration slit. Within
a structural unit are representations of the individual layers of the capil￾lary wall, namely, the fenestrated endothelium, the basement membrane,
and the epithelial filtration slits with slit diaphragms. By solving the
differential equations describing viscous flow through each of these
layers, and using the concept of resistances in series, a value for k is
obtained. In addition to the values of 6bm and W measured in the present
study, a number of other quantities are needed as inputs for the calcula￾tion of k. The other quantities, which include the intrinsic (Darcy)
permeability of the glomerular basement membrane and the dimensions
of various other structures, were estimated from data reported for normal
rats, as described in detail previously (22, 23). The values of the other

where the osmotic pressure coefficients are given by a1 = 1.629 mmHg/
(g/dl) and a2 = 0.2935 mmHg/(g/dl)2. The protein concentration ratio
was related to the filtration fraction by CE/CA = 1/(1 - FF), where
FF = GFR/RPF.
The calculation of AP from equation 6 began by making an initial
guess for B. For filtration fractions no larger than normal levels for
humans (i.e., FF - 0.2), an excellent initial guess is given by
B 1 + [1 + A2][FF/(l - FF)]
1 - e-IA) (8)
Equation 8 was derived from a perturbation solution to the differential
equation for C, and becomes exact in the limit FF -+ 0. Starting with the
initial guess for B, equation 6 was solved iteratively using a Levenberg￾Marquardt algorithm, with the integral evaluated using the Romberg
method, as implemented in Mathcad (Mathsoft, Cambridge, MA).
Statistical analysis
The significance of differences between the two groups was evaluated
by a two-tailed, Student's t test or the Mann Whitney U test, depending
on the distribution of the findings. All results are expressed as the
mean±standard error.

donors in group 2 (10/11) than group 1 (6112), the former
allografts were subject to more ischemia. This was most clearly
evidenced by the period of cold storage time, which was twofold
longer in group 2 than group 1, 20±3 vs 10±4 h, respectively
(P < 0.01). Warm ischemia, albeit partial, also tended to be
greater in group 2 than in group 1. Thus, eight cadaveric donors
in group 2 vs 4 in group 1 exhibited episodes of hypotension
(systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg) lasting between 10 and
240 min. This resulted in a lower value for mean arterial pres￾sure at the time of donor nephrectomy, 80±6 in group 2 vs
92±4 mmHg in group 1. Similarly, rewarming ischemic time
during vascular anastomosis was longer in group 2 than in group

latter two differences reached statistical significance (Table I).

endothelin I levels differed between the two groups. However,
the levels of each vasoconstrictor peptide were markedly ele￾vated above the normal range (Table II). A comparison between

Glomerularfunction and structure. The GFR was depressed
to only 6±2 ml/min/1.73 m2 in group 2 vs 29±5 ml/min/1.73
m' in group 1 (P < 0.01). The RPF was also significantly lower
in group 2 than in group 1 (Table HI). However, depression of
RPF was proportionately less than that of GFR, with the result
that the filtration fraction in group 2 was profoundly depressed
to only 0.02±0.01 vs 0.10±0.02 in group 1 (P < 0.001). The
rA was numerically lower by 2 mmHg in group 2 than group
1 (Table I). Consequent upon the extreme depression of the
filtration fraction in group 2, there was little axial rise in oncotic
pressure along the glomerular capillaries. Thus, calculated 7rrc,
the pressure that opposes the formation of filtrate, was signifi￾cantly lower in group 2 than group 1, 18.8±1.0 vs 22.0±1.1
mmHg, respectively (P < 0.05, Fig. 3). By exclusion, a fall in
either Kf or AP, or some combination of the two, must be
invoked to explain the hypofiltration in group 2.
Neither glomerular volume nor S differed between the
groups (Table I). The same was true for basement membrane
thickness (Table Ill). However, there was a patchy broadening
of epithelial foot processes in group 2, not seen in group 1 (Fig.
4). This resulted in a significant reduction in the frequency of
epithelial filtration slits in the former, 1,154±48 vs 1,352±39
slits per mm, respectively (P < 0.01, Table I). As a result
calculated k was significantly lower in the glomerular capillary

III). Of interest, the 14% reduction in k in group 2 was com￾pletely offset by a trend towards a larger value for S than
in group 1 (Table Ill). Thus, estimated allograft Kf was not
significantly different between the two groups, tending to be, if
anything, slightly higher in group 2 than group 1, 3.52±0.57
vs 3.12±0.29 ml/(min-mmHg), respectively.
The ultrafiltration model used in the present study revealed
that GER depression in group 2 was predominantly, if not
uniquely, due to AP depression. In performing these calcula￾tions we undertook a sensitivity analysis so as to take possible
variations introduced by our assumption of total glomerular
number and potential backleak of glomerular filtrate into ac￾count. Depending upon whether glomerular number per allo￾graft was 0.7 or 1.0 x 106, and whether or not there was
backleak of filtrate, the computed AP in group 1 varied between
33.8 and 44.6 mmHg (Table IV). The corresponding computa￾tions for AP in group 2 varied between only 20.2 and 21.4
mmHg, with the value under each set of conditions significantly
lower than the corresponding value in group 1 (Table IV). The
hypothetical values for AP that minimize the disparity between
the two groups are illustrated in Fig. 3. These illustrated values
assume 1 x 106 glomeruli per allograft and a 33% backleak in
group 2 but not group 1 (Table IV). As shown, AP under these
"best case" conditions of comparison is 33.8±2.3 mmHg in
group 1, a value which exceeds corresponding 7rGc by 12 mmHg.
In contrast, the AP computed for group 2 is only slightly higher
than the corresponding value for 7rGc, 20.7±1.4 vs 18.8±1.0
mmHg, respectively (Fig. 3). Thus, our computations for AP
suggest that postischemic filtration failure in group 2 was asso￾ciated with dissipation of the net pressure for ultrafiltration.
Tubular function and structure. The allografts of both
groups exhibited marked tubular dysfunction typical of post￾ischemic tubular injury. The fractional excretion of sodium was
elevated to > 20% and isosthenuria was present in each group
(Table V). Tubular morphometry revealed structural injury to
be most prevalent in proximal tubules, and to be also similar

in the two groups (Table V). Only - 2% of proximal tubular
cells exhibited necrosis. However, by electron microscopy,
proximal tubular injury was widespread, as judged by approxi￾mately one-half of all such cells exhibiting either a marked
reduction or complete absence of apical brush border (Table
V, Fig. 5). Many of the necrotic tubular cells remained attached
to the tubular basement membrane. As a result, only a small
fraction of tubular cells, 1.1±0.09 vs 1.0±0.01% in group 1
and group 2, respectively, were found to have sloughed into the
tubular lumen. Neither the fractional luminal area of tubules
nor the fractional Bowman's space area were significantly larger
in group 2 than in group 1. Similarly, the fractional interstitial
area was not different in the two groups (Table V). Thus,
judged by these morphological criteria, neither tubular obstruc￾tion nor transtubular backleak of filtrate were more prominent
in group 2 than in group 1.
Postoperative allograft function. A model of creatinine ki￾netics was used to calculate the creatinine clearance profile in
each recipient from daily changes in serum creatinine levels
and in body water, where the latter change was derived from
daily body weight ( 14). As illustrated in Fig. 6, group 1 patients
exhibited a progressive rise in creatinine clearance during the
first four postoperative days. The mean clearance entered the
normal range on postoperative day 2 and achieved a plateau of
- 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 from day 4 onwards. Group 2, by
contrast, exhibited a marked and relatively constant depression
of computed creatinine clearance throughout the first postopera￾tive week. An ensuing azotemia required one or more postopera￾tive dialyses in 7 of the 11 members of group 2.
A more detailed evaluation of postoperative allograft func￾tion was undertaken on day 3. By this time, fluid retention was
twice as marked in group 2 as in group 1 (Table VI). This was
accompanied by significantly greater central venous hyperten￾sion (Table VI). Plasma renin activity in group 1 returned to
the normal range. Despite the increasing hypervolemia in group
2, however, plasma renin activity remained markedly elevated,
exceeding corresponding group 1 levels by more than threefold
(Table VI). A similar disparity was observed for endothelin I,
which on day 3 averaged 12.5±3.4 in group 2 vs 5.0±0.6 pg/
ml in group 1 (P < 0.05).
Whereas GFR doubled between the operation day and post￾operative day 3 in group 1 (29±5 - 59±4 ml/min, P < 0.01),
this quantity remained unchanged at only 6±2 ml/min in group
2. The increase in GFR in group 1 could not be attributed to
changes in either RPF or 7rA. Assuming that renal PAH extrac￾tion was likely normal in group 1 by postoperative day 3 (25),
we have used the PAH clearance to estimate that the filtration
fraction increased by 70% between the two examinations (Table

VI). Assuming further that the essentially normal glomerular
morphometry observed in this group on day 0 remained unal￾tered, we used Kf calculated from the intraoperative biopsy
along with day 3 values for GFR, RPF, and 7rA to compute the
prevailing AP. These computations suggest that AP increased
between the two examinations by 11 or 16 mmHg to 45.4±2.8
or 54.7±3.9 mmHg, respectively, depending upon whether the
allograft contained 1.0 or 0.7 x 106 glomeruli. In each hypothet￾ical example, the increment in AP between the two examina￾tions is highly significant (Fig. 7). Given constancy of 7rGc
between the two examinations (Fig. 7) and the assumption of
unchanging Kf, the early doubling of GFR in group 1 appears,
therefore, to be an exclusive consequence of a AP-mediated
increase in ultrafiltration pressure.
The enhancement of GFR on postoperative day 3 in group
1 was associated with recovery of tubular function. Urinary
concentrating ability was restored and FENA declined to
3.2±0.8%, a value appropriate to the 6% excess of body water
and high central venous pressure observed at this time (Table
VI). In contrast, sustained hypofiltration in group 2 was accom￾panied by persistent isosthenuria and excretion of a high fraction
of the filtered sodium load (Table VI). Given this evidence of
persistent tubular dysfunction, we infer that PAH extraction is
likely to have been markedly impaired on postoperative day 3
(6, 26, 27). Accordingly, we have not attempted to use the
PAH clearance to make estimates of values for the filtration
fraction, rGc, or AP in group 2 at this time.
Discussion
Despite storage of the donor kidney at 40C before transplanta￾tion, we have shown postischemic injury to the human renal
allograft to be invariable. Provided that the ischemic interval
was brief, as was usually the case when the graft was taken
from a living relative, such injury lasted for < 36 h. It was
characterized by extensive reduction in apical brush border and
patchy necrosis of tubular cells, notably those of the proximal
tubule (28, 29). It was associated with transient impairment of
sodium reabsorption, urinary concentrating ability, and glomer￾ular ultrafiltration. When the ischemic interval was of longer

duration, as was the case in many recipients of cadaveric grafts,
a more prolonged injury was manifest. In addition to persistent
tubular dysfunction, it was characterized by profound hypofil￾tration, which lasted for > 36 h. The extent of initial microvas￾cular injury in the immediate wake of graft reperfusion distin￾guished between those destined to develop a transient or sus￾tained postischemic injury to the allograft. In contrast, the extent
of the corresponding, initial injury to the tubule was not pre￾dictive of the subsequent course of allograft function.
We have attempted to elucidate the mechanism of postisch￾emic hypofiltration by comparing each determinant of the GFR
between those with a sustained injury (group 2) and those with
a transient injury (group 1). Paradoxically, we found 7rrc to be
lower in the former, a finding which should have enhanced and
not depressed the GFR (24). Using a morphological approach,
we were also unable to demonstrate a role for depression of Kf
in the genesis of hypofiltration. We did, however, observe a
broadening of glomerular epithelial foot processes in those with
severe hypofiltration. This finding has also been reported in
animal models of postischemic acute renal failure (7, 30), and
has led to Kf depression in this setting (7). In the members of
group 2 in the present study, an ensuing reduction by 14% in
the value for k was offset by a trend towards enhanced S. Given
the limited sample of glomeruli that we were able to examine,
we cannot exclude the possibility that the latter finding was
spurious. Nevertheless, the focal and modest nature of the reduc￾tion in filtration slit frequency makes it unlikely that k could
have been sufficiently depressed to account for the severe hypo￾filtration observed in the subjects of group 2 (22).
We are thus led to the conclusion that the early depression
of allograft GFR in group 2 subjects was predominantly a conse￾quence of a profound reduction in AP. In computing the range
into which AP was depressed, we have attempted to account
for potential errors introduced by two quantities which could
not be determined, and had to be assumed. One of these is the
mean number of glomeruli per human kidney, which is used to
calculate Kf. This quantity has been estimated at - 1 X 106 by

one group of workers and at -0.7 x 106 by another (21, 31)
Another unknown is whether or not tubular injury in the present
study was accompanied by transtubular backleak of filtrate into
the interstitium (13, 32, 33). The latter phenomenon would
result in an underestimation by the urinary clearance technique
of GFR, an input value in the mathematical model used to
calculate AP.
Provided that the number of glomeruli was similar in each
group of subjects, and regardless of the presence or absence of
backleak, our computations suggest that AP was substantially
lower in group 2 than in group 1 subjects of the present study.
Table IV shows that computed AP in group 1 varied between
34 and 45 mmHg, a range that is similar to that estimated in
the normal rat or dog by micropuncture (5, 7, 34). That these
computations are reasonable is suggested further by the finding
that the large increment in GFR observed over the first three
days in group 1 subjects can only be satisfactorily explained by
an increase in AP. This, too, is similar to the response after
contralateral nephrectomy demonstrated by micropuncture in
experimental animals (34). In contrast to values > 34 mmHg
computed for AP in group 1, the corresponding values for AP
in group 2 varied between only 20 and 21 mmHg, depending
on the number of glomeruli used to calculate Kf and the assump￾tion of the presence or absence of backleak of filtrate. This
computed range is only 1-2 mmHg higher than the correspond￾ing value of 19±1.0 mmHg for 7rGc (Fig. 3). Thus, as in the
experimental models of postischemic acute renal failure in the
rat or dog, allograft filtration failure in the present study appears
to be attributable mainly to a dissipation of the net pressure for
ultrafiltration (2, 3, 5).
As stated previously, the depression of AP that has been
observed within the first few hours in experimental postischemic
acute renal failure has been associated with a high hydraulic

pressure in Bowman's space due to obstruction of the pars recta
of proximal tubules (4). Because our biopsy sample was too
superficial to incorporate the pars recta, we are unable to ex￾clude a similar phenomenon in the allografts of group 2 subjects
in the present study. Pars recta obstruction in the postischemic
rat kidney, however, was accompanied by dilatation of the up￾stream convolutions of the proximal tubule (4). In our assess￾ment of tubular morphology of group 2 allografts by contrast,
we were unable to find evidence of dilatation of either tubular
lumina or Bowman's space (Table V). Furthermore, in keeping
with the observations of Olsen and Solez and their co-workers,
we observed a paucity of necrotic cells or other debris in the
lumina of the tubules of the allograft (35). Conceivably, cold
ischemia at 40C ameliorated the extent of tubule cell karyorr￾hexis when compared to that which follows warm ischemia
(36). Thus, our morphometric analysis of allograft tubular dam￾age points away from an important contribution to the postisch￾emic injury by tubular obstruction. This, in turn, points to affer￾ent arteriolar constriction with an attendant fall in glomerular
perfusion pressure as the primary mechanism by which glomer￾ular filtration is brought to a halt in the freshly transplanted,
human allograft. We wish to emphasize, however, that tubular
necrosis has been shown to be more extensive in postischemic
injury of the native than the transplanted kidney (37). We, thus,
recommend that the present findings not be extrapolated to infer
that tubular obstruction is not an important cause of postisch￾emic filtration failure in the native kidney.
The high fraction of filtered sodium reaching final urine
suggests that a large load of filtered sodium could have reached
the macula densa, thereby mediating afferent vasoconstriction
via tubulo-glomerular feedback (38). We have recently re￾ported a loss of polarity of proximal tubular cells in the allo￾grafts of group 2 subjects, a phenomenon which could lead to
impaired proximal reabsorption of sodium (39). Among other
potential mediators of afferent vasoconstriction in the setting
of postischemic filtration failure is the demonstrated excess of
circulating levels of renin and endothelin 1 (40-43). Although
each peptide was similarly elevated in the two groups intraoper￾atively, the elevation was sustained on day 3 only in the subjects
of group 2. This raises the possibility that both endothelin I
and angiotensin II contributed via afferent constriction to the
sustained depression of AP that appears to underlie the persis￾tent hypofiltration exhibited by group 2 allografts.

CREATININE CLEARANCE (mlmin/1.73 m2)
Figure 8. lothalamate clearance is plotted as a function of simultaneous
creatinine clearance on day 3, when there was no interference in the
iothalamate assay. The identity (solid) and regression lines (dashed)
are shown.
Persistent hyperreninemia in group 2 subjects, and the dem￾onstration that their allografts were likely the source of the
excess renin (Fig. 2), also provides indirect evidence in support
of an important role for afferent vasoconstriction in the postisch￾emic hypofiltration. Given that our group 2 subjects were exam￾ined in the supine position under conditions of increasing hyper￾volemia, and that the transplanted kidney is denervated (45),
renin production should have been depressed and not stimulated
(46). The only remaining stimulus for renin release that we
can identify is that which is mediated by preglomerular barore￾ceptors in response to a reduction in perfusion pressure. Thus,
persistent hyperreninemia, a high renovascular resistance, a
computed reduction in AP, and a paucity of morphological
evidence for tubular obstruction are all consistent with the pres￾ence of afferent vasoconstriction in the group 2 allografts of
the present study. We propose that this alteration in segmental
renovascular resistance could well be the proximate cause of
postischemic filtration failure in the freshly transplanted kidney.
Appendix
A comparison was made between the simultaneous clearances of exoge￾nous iothalamate and endogenous (true) creatinine in day 3 studies,
during which the absence of interfering substances permitted iothalamate
levels to be assayed. Linear regression analysis reveals the relationship
between the two clearances to be strong, with a coefficient of correlation
(R value) of 0.99 (Fig. 8). The method of Bland and Altman was used
to evaluate the level of agreement between the two methods (47). The
confidence interval of agreement was estimated by plotting the differ￾ence between simultaneous iothalamate and creatinine clearances as a
function of the average of the two clearances. Among members of group
2 with hypofiltration, there was no bias between the methods. The mean
value of iothalamate minus creatinine clearance was 0. The confidence
interval of agreement (±2 SD) was - 3 to + 3 ml/min. Surprisingly,
among members of group 1 with normal GFR, a bias in favor of iothala￾mate was observed. The mean value for iothalamate minus creatinine
clearance was + 6 ml/min. This trend for iothalamate clearance to ex￾ceed creatinine clearance in group 1 is clearly evident by inspection of
Fig. 8. The confidence interval of agreement between the two methods
in group 1 subjects (±2 SD) was - 6 to + 18 ml/min. Given the large
average difference in GFR of 53 ml/min between groups 1 and 2 on
postoperative day 3 (Table VI), we submit that the level of agreement
between iothalamate and creatinine clearance is sufficiently good to
allow the latter to be used as a measure of GFR during the early evalua￾tion of GFR on the operation day. We speculate that the tubular creati￾nine transporter could have been saturated at the high levels of serum
creatinine that prevailed at the time of the day 3 study (5±1 mg/
dl). This would explain the apparent absence of a measurable tubular
secretory component to the creatinine clearance under the conditions of
our study.
