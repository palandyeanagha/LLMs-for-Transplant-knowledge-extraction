Emerging research on the roles of stromal cells in modulating adaptive immune responses has included a new 
focus on lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). LECs are presumably the first cells that come into direct contact 
with peripheral antigens, cytokines, danger signals, and immune cells travelling from peripheral tissues to lymph 
nodes. LECs can modulate dendritic cell function, present antigens to T cells on MHC class I and MHC class II 
molecules, and express immunomodulatory cytokines and receptors, which suggests that their roles in adaptive 
immunity are far more extensive than previously realized. This Review summarizes the emergent evidence that 
LECs are important in maintaining peripheral tolerance, limiting and resolving effector T cell responses, and 
modulating leukocyte function.
Introduction
Our appreciation for the varied functions of lymphatic vessels has 
evolved from different scientific disciplines. Traditionally, micro￾circulatory physiologists studied the essential transport functions 
of lymphatic vessels in removing fluid, molecules, and cells after 
leaking from blood vessels in the periphery and before return￾ing them to the blood circulation. Lymph indicated the state of 
the local interstitial fluid it drained, with Starling forces dictat￾ing fluid and solute balance (1–3). Immunologists recognized the 
importance of lymphatic vessels as channels for leukocyte traf￾ficking from peripheral sites to their draining LNs (4–6), and as 
conduits for soluble antigens that can be taken up directly by LN￾resident B cells and immature DCs (7–10), which help regulate the 
kinetics of antigen presentation.
More connections between these two different perspectives have 
emerged in recent years. Lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) them￾selves have been shown to play active roles in controlling their 
transport functions and in directly communicating with immune 
cells to modulate their immediate and downstream functions. 
Indeed, a growing body of evidence is demonstrating how LECs 
help shape both innate and adaptive immune responses through 
(a) expression of multiple cytokines, adhesion molecules, and 
inhibitory receptors; (b) scavenging and processing antigens for 
direct presentation to T cells or modulating the activity of profes￾sional APCs; and (c) actively regulating fluid and solute transport 
functions in response to inflammatory signals. These new ideas, in 
turn, reveal a paradigm whereby the transport and immune func￾tions of lymphatic vessels, which were previously considered sepa￾rately, are in fact intimately coupled.
In this Review, we highlight these connections to reveal new 
roles of LECs, along with their transport functions, in modulat￾ing adaptive immune responses. While we particularly focus on 
LEC interactions with DCs and T cells, we also highlight features 
that support immune regulation, including the structure and 
function of lymphatic vessels and the compartmentalization of 
the LN stroma, which help control the manner in which LECs 
can interface with immune cells. Ongoing research in this area is 
essential to understanding how inflammatory lymphangiogen￾esis affects both cancer progression as well as chronic inflamma￾tion that leads to autoimmunity.
Transport and trafficking functions of the lymphatic 
system
The lymphatic vessels and secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) are 
arranged in a manner that optimizes interactions among antigens, 
APCs, and innate and adaptive effector cells. SLOs include the spleen, 
LNs, and Peyer’s patches, but this Review focuses on LNs, since 
LEC/T cell interactions are best described in this compartment.
Lymph flow transports soluble antigens. The LNs serve as hubs of anti￾gen presentation, where lymphocytes are primed or tolerized against 
antigens presented by APCs. Lymph fluid drained from the periph￾ery via afferent lymphatic vessels bathes LNs with soluble foreign 
antigens as well as tissue-specific self-antigens and any other mole￾cules present in the local periphery, such as cytokines from inflamed 
tissues or tumors (10). Because lymph originates as interstitial fluid 
surrounding the cells of peripheral tissues, it is enriched in peptides 
that are processed extracellularly, including those resulting from 
local catabolism, ECM degradation, apoptosis, and tissue remodel￾ing (9, 11). While tissue-resident DCs take up and process antigens 
for presentation on MHC molecules, often resulting in DC matura￾tion and migration to LNs (12), free antigens can rapidly drain to the 
LN via the subcapsular sinus, where large antigens and opsonized 
material may be directly taken up by subcapsular macrophages (Fig￾ure 1). Smaller antigens are channeled deeper into the B and T cell 
zones via intricate conduit systems. In the paracortex, conduits are 
formed by fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) wrapped around bun￾dled collagen fibers (13, 14), while in the B cell zone, follicular DCs 
help form channels for perfusion.
The importance of the B cell conduit system has been demon￾strated using two-photon microscopy. For example, Roozendaal 
and colleagues using two-photon microscopy. They observed that 
after intradermal injection, lymph-borne antigen rapidly entered the 
draining LN and either was taken up by subcapsular macrophages 
(large antigens) or bathed the B cell zone via conduits (small anti￾gens), where antigen-specific B cells efficiently internalized the anti￾gen (14). In the paracortex, immature LN-resident DCs can also take 
up and present lymph-borne antigen (first wave) prior to the arrival

of antigen-loaded tissue-resident DCs, which further activates 
T cells in a second wave. These differential presentation kinetics 
have been suggested to fine-tune immune responses, as it is likely 
that the first wave primes the draining LN for the arrival of the sec￾ond wave, driving adaptive immune responses (7).
This notion that antigen presentation kinetics help prime as 
well as control immune responses has profound implications for 
the importance of lymphatic flow in adaptive immunity. A recent 
study demonstrated that the absence of soluble antigen transport 
severely impacts the education of B and T cells in LNs (15). Using 
K14–VEGFR-3–Ig transgenic mice, which lack dermal lymphatic 
capillaries but possess intact LNs and otherwise normal lymphatic 
vasculature, it was shown that intradermal vaccination of these mice 
led to a drastically reduced antibody response, as expected. However, 
T cell activation, although delayed, remained robust even though 
DC trafficking from the injection site to the draining LN was nearly 
absent. Whereas T cell activation took place primarily in the drain￾ing LNs in WT mice, this process was found to occur in the spleens 
of the K14–VEGFR-3–Ig mice. Interestingly, the lack of lymphatic 
drainage from skin led to autoimmunity in aged mice, and young 
mice could not be tolerized to exogenous antigen using a classic 
skin tolerance test (15). Therefore, blocked lymphatic flow prevents 
soluble antigen transport to the LNs, leading to repercussions in the 
generation of inflammatory responses against foreign antigens and 
in the maintenance of peripheral tolerance (16).
Lymph flow is strongly controlled by local tissue inflammation, 
and various inflammatory cytokines as well as enhanced intersti￾tial flow, which occurs rapidly after tissue injury or infection due to 
microvascular hyperpermeability, increase both lymph formation and 
subsequent pumping efficiency of collecting vessels (17, 18). In turn, 
such locally controlled lymph flow regulates immunity both by (a) 
providing a first wave of soluble antigens after infection or challenge 
to prime and regulate effector immune responses and (b) providing a 
constant flow of abundant tissue self-antigens that bathe the LN even 
under non-infectious conditions to delete autoreactive T cells.
Lymphatic recruitment of DCs and other migratory cells. We will brief￾ly discuss how LECs facilitate the transport of leukocytes from 
the periphery, since this is the topic of several excellent recent 
Figure 1
Lymphatic vessels continuously provide local information about the tissues they drain to various cells in the LNs. Lymph-borne antigens may be 
foreign or self-antigens derived from physiologic cellular metabolism, tissue destruction, and apoptotic cells. Left: immunostained section of a 
mouse LN shows B cell follicles (B220, green), T cells (CD3e, red), and lymphatic vessels (LYVE-1, white). Right: schematic of the subcapsular 
sinus, where soluble antigens can access the T cell zone via small conduits enwrapped by FRCs or be taken up by subcapsular macrophages 
(SCMs). DCs also enter via afferent lymphatic vessels and are attracted by the chemokines CCL19 and CCL21, which bind their receptor CCR7 
and which are produced by FRCs and lymphatic endothelium. Naive and regulatory T cells, which also express CCR7, enter mostly through HEVs 
and less frequently through afferent lymphatics. In the B cell zone, conduits lined by follicular dendritic cells (not shown) enable B cells to rapidly 
access small antigens that enter from the subcapsular sinus.

reviews (19–21). LECs both attract and facilitate transmigra￾tion of immune cells through a number of signaling axes, many 
of which have been identified in LEC gene expression studies 
(22–26). In addition to identifying multiple cytokines and recep￾tors expressed by LECs under steady-state conditions (22), these 
studies also identified genes that are upregulated during localized 
inflammatory processes such as in models of contact hypersen￾sitivity (23), tumor drainage (25), and inflammation (26). These 
studies and others indicate that LECs are capable of expressing 
and actively signaling through a variety of cytokines and adhesion 
receptor–ligand interactions important in immunity (Tables 1, 2, 
and 3, and refs. 17, 27–30).
LECs express a variety of chemokines that attract DCs as well as 
other cellular mediators of innate immunity, including monocytes, 
basophils, and neutrophils (Table 1), although most of these cells 
rarely migrate to the LNs (25, 28, 31–34). Among the most well￾studied is CCL21 (35–38), a lymphoid homing chemokine that 
binds to CCR7 on migratory DCs, some macrophage subtypes, 
and naive, central memory and regulatory T cells, among others 
(39). Mice lacking CCR7 ligands have drastically impaired DC 
and T cell homing to LNs and cannot mount adaptive immune 
responses there, indicating that CCL21/CCR7 signaling is neces￾sary for cell trafficking from the periphery to LNs (39).
Other chemokines secreted by LECs recruit T and B lympho￾cytes, which enter the LNs in large numbers to be educated by 
APCs and to mount effective adaptive immune responses. The 
recruitment of naive T cells into LNs is controlled by LECs and 
FRCs via CCL21 and CCL19 (another ligand of CCR7), which are 
present throughout the cortical zone and eventually transcytosed 
into the lumen of high endothelial venules (HEVs) (40–42). CCL21 
also enhances the affinity of lymphocyte function–associated anti￾gen 1 (LFA-1) on circulating naive T cells for ICAM-1 on blood 
endothelial cells (BECs), thereby promoting migration (42, 43).
LECs can also modulate DC and macrophage trafficking through 
expression of the chemokine-scavenging decoy receptor D6, which 
is upregulated in the context of inflammation and tumor drainage 
(44–47). It has been suggested that D6 helps regulate the extracellular 
concentrations of its ligands CCL2 and CCL5 (48), as mice deficient 
for D6 develop exacerbated inflammatory responses (49) and exhibit 
congestion of the lymphatic vessels by macrophages. Thus, by regu￾lating extracellular CCL2, D6 may help to ensure that lymphatic con￾duits are uncongested to facilitate DC trafficking (47).
Many adhesion molecules are expressed by LECs to facilitate 
leukocyte transmigration across LECs. ICAM-1 is important for 
DC and T cell adhesion and synergizes with CCL21 to promote 
lymphocyte binding and migration (50). DCs can also transmi￾Table 2

grate into the lymphatic vessels using the plexin-A1/neuropi￾lin-1 (Plxa1/Nrp1) receptor complex to engage semaphorin-3A 
(Sema3A) expressed on LECs (51). These are also upregulated 
upon inflammatory stimuli (refs. 17, 27–30, and Table 2). For 
example, elevated local interstitial fluid stresses result in increased 
fluid flow into the lymphatics, triggering augmented lymphatic 
secretion of CCL21 and upregulation of ICAM-1 and E-selectin 
(17). CCR7 signaling may in turn enhance the affinity of LFA-1 on 
DCs for ICAM-1, suggesting that this may be a synergistic mecha￾nism to facilitate DC homing to LNs following antigenic challenge 
(43). In this way, antigenic challenge can rapidly lead to changes in 
lymphatic phenotype that result in enhanced recruitment of DCs 
and their migration to the LNs, comprising the early stages of an 
effective antigen-specific, adaptive immune response (Figure 2).
Interestingly, in contrast to K14–VEGFR-3–Ig mice that lack der￾mal lymphatic capillaries and demonstrate impaired DC migra￾tion, Chy mice, which lack the majority of dermal lymphatic cap￾illaries, have rare patches of these vessels in their back skin that 
express higher levels of CCL21. In these mice, DC migration to 
LNs draining the back skin appeared normal despite severely 
impaired lymphatic drainage, indicating that lymphatic density 
governs fluid and antigen drainage rather than DC migration (52). 
This has implications for understanding the role of local lymphan￾giogenesis, where lymphatic vessels expand and become hyperplas￾tic, which occurs in chronic inflammation.
Thus, LECs actively regulate leukocyte trafficking by modulat￾ing expression of chemokines and adhesion molecules according 
to the local state of inflammation in the tissue. LECs can inte￾grate multiple signals, including complement activation products 
and increased flow as well as most danger signals via TLR signal￾ing (Table 2), allowing them to modulate their differential regu￾lation of leukocyte trafficking or delivery of antigens and local 
tissue cytokines (17).
LECs regulate entry of immune cells into LNs. Upon arrival at the 
LNs, migratory DCs exit afferent lymphatic vessels into the sub￾capsular sinus (53). At this junction, LECs lining the subcapsular 
sinus express not only CCR7 ligands, but also CCL1, which binds 
CCR8 on DCs (5, 54, 55). In this way, LECs may act as gatekeeper 
cells, selecting CCR8+ cells for entry into the LNs (55). DCs then 
traverse the intranodal sinuses in order to gain access to the T cell 
zone, enabling them to influence downstream adaptive immune 
responses. The T cell zone is rich with FRCs, which help guide and 
module DC–T cell interactions (56).
In addition to lining the subcapsular sinus, LECs also infiltrate 
into the cortical and medullary sinuses (Figure 1) to presumably 
direct antigen and leukocytes into the T cell zone. Although T cells 
generally enter LNs via HEVs (19, 57), afferent lymph-derived T cells 
may also enter the parenchyma via medullary sinuses (58). LECs 
direct lymphocyte trafficking to the medullary sinuses and eventu￾ally guide egress of T cells from the LN. As such, T cells frequently 
encounter LECs throughout their migration through the LN.
Collectively, these data establish that LECs not only express traffick￾ing molecules that affect migration of immune cells, but also possess 
the appropriate machinery to modulate DC and T cell function.

Modulation of T cell activation by lymphatics
LECs present antigen for T cell regulation. LECs express MHC class I 
(59–61) and MHC class II (26, 62) molecules and can directly 
induce T cell tolerance as well as suppress DC-mediated T cell 
activation. A variety of immunoregulatory factors are expressed 
by LECs that enable these functions. For example, LECs secrete 
TGF-β, indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and nitric oxide, all of 
which are immunosuppressive (22, 26, 32, 63). T cell activation is 
also affected by the relative balance of co-stimulatory and inhibi￾tory receptors on the surface of the activating APC. LECs express 
high levels of the inhibitory receptor PD-L1 (62) and subopti￾mal levels of co-stimulatory molecules such as CD80, CD86, and 
ICOSL (Table 3 and refs. 26, 62).
These expression patterns suggest that LECs may act as APCs. 
Indeed, several studies have now shown that LECs, as well as other 
LN stromal cell (LNSC) subsets such as FRCs, can modulate T cell 
function through direct presentation of endogenous and exog￾enous antigens (Figure 3). In murine models, LNSCs express vari￾ous peripheral tissue antigens (PTAs), which they can present to 
naive CD8+ T cells, thus leading to activation and tolerance (61, 
64, 65) due to the absence of co-stimulatory molecules and high 
levels of PD-L1. Different LNSC subsets, including LECs, FRCs, 
and BECs, have distinct patterns of PTA expression (60, 66), sug￾gesting different roles in modulating responses to these antigens. 
However, the antigen-presenting capacity of LNSCs seems to be 
attributable primarily to LECs and FRCs (66). Notably, LECs 
were the only subset to express the PTA tyrosinase epitope Tyr369, 
a major immunotherapy target for melanoma (60, 66). If these 
observations prove to hold true in humans, LEC-induced toler￾ance of Tyr369-specific CD8+ T cells could have a direct impact on 
the clinical efficacy of anti-melanoma immunotherapies.
The observation that LECs and FRCs can tolerize CD8+ T cells 
led to a paradigm shift in models of peripheral tolerance induc￾tion, as conventional wisdom attributed suppression of autoreac￾tive CD8+ T cells to activation by quiescent DCs (67). However, 
the ability of non-hematopoietic cells to induce peripheral CD8+
T cell tolerance is not unique to LECs and FRCs. Liver sinusoidal 
endothelial cells (LSECs) are considered critical for tolerance to 
food antigens, as they mount CD8+ deletional tolerance against 
exogenous antigens coming directly from the gut (68, 69). Tol￾erance induction by stromal cells is reminiscent of central toler￾ance induced in the thymus by stromal medullary thymic epithe￾lial cells (mTECs), a process that is dependent on PTA expression 
driven by the autoimmune regulator Aire (70). Due to the similari￾ties between LNSCs and mTECs, the dependence of Aire in LNSC￾mediated induction of CD8+ T cell tolerance was investigated. 
Using a PTA expressed under the Aire promotor, extrathymic Aire￾expressing cells (eTACs) were implicated in inducing CD8+ T cell 
tolerance in SLOs (71). LEC expression of PTAs, including Tyr369, 
was found to be independent of Aire, whereas PTA expression by 
double-negative (DN) LNSCs (podoplanin-
/CD31-
) and CD45+
cells was strongly Aire dependent (60). Thus, it remains unknown 
what drives PTA expression in LECs and FRCs, but both subsets 
express Deaf1 (60), a transcriptional regulator that induces PTA 
expression in pancreatic LN (72), suggesting a possible role for this 
factor in mediating tolerance induced by LECs and FRCs.
There are multiple potential pathways by which peripheral 
tolerance may be induced. For example, lack of appropriate co￾stimulation or engagement of inhibitory receptors during CD8+
T cell activation results in anergy or deletion. As such, the relative 
expression of co-stimulatory and inhibitory receptors on APCs 
influences the outcome of T cell activation. In the steady state, 
expression of most co-stimulatory receptors by LECs is low (32, 
62), while multiple inhibitory receptors are expressed at high lev￾els (62). In a model of LEC-induced tolerance of Tyr369-specific 
CD8+ T cells, lack of co-stimulation through CD137 (4-1BB) led 
to upregulation of PD-1 and inhibition of CD25 (IL-2Rα) on CD8+
T cells, rendering them resistant to IL-2–mediated pro-survival 
signaling. Deletion was mediated by PD-L1 expressed on LECs, 
since blockade of this receptor prevented deletion of Tyr369-spe￾cific CD8+ T cells, resulting in autoimmunity (62). This observa￾tion was consistent with previous data demonstrating the loss of 
LNSC-induced CD8+ tolerance against intestinal PTAs induced by 
PD-L1 blockade, which led to autoimmune enteritis (73).
In addition to their role in inducing tolerance of autoreactive 
CD8+ T cells, we recently demonstrated that LECs can scavenge 
and cross-present foreign antigen to naive CD8+ T cells (59). In this 
model, B16 F10 melanomas expressed OVA as a foreign antigen, 
and a second B16 F10 cell line also expressed VEGF-C to enhance 
tumor and LN lymphangiogenesis. LECs in the tumor-draining 
LN cross-presented OVA to CD8+ T cells, leading to deletion of 
OVA-specific CD8+ T cells. Moreover, VEGF-C–induced lymphan￾giogenesis further promoted tolerance, and could even protect the 
tumor against CD8+ T cell immunity (59).
The interactions between LECs and CD4+ T cells are less well 
described. In the steady state, LECs express low basal levels of MHC 
class II molecules (26, 32, 74), and IFN-γ induces MHC class II 
upregulation (32). Although LECs do not express conventional 
co-stimulatory molecules such as CD80 and CD86, they express 
LFA-1 (CD58), which can bind CD2 to provide co-stimulation to 
T cells. Despite the presence of these molecules, LECs failed to 
induce CD4+ T cell proliferation or cytokine production in an allo￾genic co-culture model (32). Thus, while it is now clear that LECs 
can take up and cross-present exogenous antigens on MHC class I 
to CD8+ T cells (59), it remains to be seen whether this scaveng￾ing activity can lead to antigen presentation on MHC class II and 
subsequent CD4+ T cell activation.

LECs actively recruit leukocytes. Tissue-resident DCs (red) take up anti￾gens in peripheral tissues, home to nearby draining lymphatic vessels 
via CCL21-driven chemotaxis, and engage ICAM-1, VCAM, and Sema3A 
for transmigration. Under inflammatory conditions, LECs can increase 
their expression of adhesion molecules and chemokines that further pro￾mote the lymphatic recruitment of DCs and other cell subsets, including 
macrophages via CCL2. LEC expression of decoy receptors such as D6 
helps limit local chemokine concentrations and shape gradients.

Together, these studies suggest that LECs behave like tolero￾genic APCs. This assessment is consistent with recent studies 
showing that LECs deleted self-reactive T cells in autoimmune 
disease models and tumor-reactive CD8+ effectors in a melanoma 
model (59, 60, 62, 65).
Modulation of DC–T cell interactions by lymphatics. In addition 
to directly interacting with T cells, LECs can suppress activa￾tion of T cells by DCs (27, 32, 63). In one study, inflamed LECs 
suppressed DC maturation, leading to a decreased efficiency 
in inducing allogenic T cell proliferation. This interaction was 
dependent on binding of macrophage-1 antigen (Mac-1) on DCs 
to ICAM-1 on LECs and was not observed in the presence of LPS 
(27). A subsequent study demonstrated that supernatant from 
IFNγ-activated LECs also impaired the ability of DCs to induce 
allogenic CD4+ T cell proliferation, even when DCs were matured 
with LPS, suggesting that LECs have multiple mechanisms of 
regulating DC–T cell interactions. Indeed, IFN-γ–activated LECs 
produce several molecules that could suppress T cell activation, 
including IDO, an enzyme that suppresses T cell proliferation by 
degrading tryptophan, a substrate required for T cell activation 
(32, 63). However, LECs were later shown to exhibit suppression 
of T cell proliferation independent of IDO. In that study, iNOS 
was found to be responsible for suppression of T cell prolifera￾tion by LECs and FRCs. iNOS catalyzes production of NO, which 
has suppressive effects on T cell proliferation and cytokine pro￾duction. iNOS was upregulated in response to IFN-γ and TNF-α
produced by activated T cells that were in direct contact with 
LECs and FRCs, indicating that bi-directional crosstalk between 
LNSC and T cells guides regulation of T cell responses by limit￾ing expansion of activated T cells in LNs (63).
Consistent with a role in induction of peripheral tolerance, a 
recent report demonstrated that LNSCs cooperate with DCs in 
order to induce regulatory T cells in the mesenteric LNs, which are 
involved in the maintenance of gut homeostasis. In that study, it 
was suggested that stimuli derived from the gut microbiota enable 
LNSCs to modulate tolerogenic properties of DCs (75).
LEC regulation of T cell homeostasis
The size, diversity, and distribution of the 
mature peripheral T cell pool is tightly 
regulated through homeostatic path￾ways affecting migration, proliferation, 
survival, and apoptosis of activated cells. 
For example, despite continuous thymic 
production of mature T cells, total T cell 
numbers remain relatively steady, suggest￾ing that peripheral T cells are continually 
lost without compromising the diversity 
of T cells in circulation (76). As major pro￾ducers of homeostatic factors, LECs are 
emerging as important players in regulat￾ing the T cell pool, although this notion 
merits further study.
LECs regulate T cell homeostasis through pro￾duction of IL-7. IL-7 is a key homeostatic 
cytokine produced primarily by non-hema￾topoietic stromal cells. It binds the IL-7Rα
chain (CD127) in combination with the 
common γ-chain (CD132) expressed on 
developing T, B, and NK lymphocytes, 
mature T cells, and certain subsets of DCs, 
macrophages, and innate lymphocytes. In LNs, IL-7 provides 
survival signals to naive and memory T cells, which respond by 
upregulating anti-apoptotic factors and downregulating IL-7Rα. 
Disruptions in IL-7 signaling cause imbalances in T cell numbers, 
such that loss of IL-7 signaling leads to lymphopenia (77).
LNSCs produce high levels of IL-7, which is critical for naive 
T cell survival (78). Although FRCs were proposed to be the major 
source of this cytokine due to their presence in T cell zones of the 
LN and expression of high levels of Il7 mRNA (78), recent studies 
demonstrated that LECs produce the most IL-7 in the LN (79–81). 
Indeed, LECs can support survival of naive T cells in vitro in an 
IL-7–dependent manner (79, 80). Importantly, IL-7 expression by 
LECs is not restricted to the LN; IL-7+ LECs have been observed in 
multiple tissues, including the lung, skin, and gut (80, 81), sug￾gesting that LECs may play an important role in the homeostasis 
of other cells that express functional IL-7 receptors.
Furthermore, T cells may regulate IL-7 production by LECs and 
FRCs in a negative regulatory loop. Specifically, blockade of lym￾phocyte entry into LNs induced elevated IL-7 expression in the LN 
(80), and similarly, LN IL-7 is upregulated during HIV-associated 
lymphopenia (82). Since T cells may negatively regulate LN lym￾phangiogenesis (83), it is possible that increased IL-7 is the result 
of increased numbers of IL-7+ stromal cells in the absence of T cell 
regulation. IL-7-expression by embryonic LECs during LN devel￾opment acts on lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells, promoting 
their survival and enabling them to drive LN organization (79). In 
line with this, IL-7+ LECs and FRCs were shown to preferentially 
expand during LN remodeling after destruction by an inflamma￾tory viral infection (79).
LECs regulate T cell egress from LNs. As mentioned above, naive 
T cells traffic to LNs in a CCR7- and CD62L-dependent manner. 
These signals also provide cues for T cell retention within the LN 
but are countered by binding of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) to 
S1P receptor 1 (S1PR1), which triggers migration of lymphocytes 
into cortical sinuses. However, if a naive T cell becomes activated 
by an APC bearing its cognate antigen while in the LN, S1PR1 is 
Figure 3
LECs can suppress immunity and promote tolerance in multiple ways. (A) LECs interact with 
DCs via binding of ICAM-1 to Mac-1, inhibiting DC maturation and thus dampening their ability to 
effectively activate T cells. (B) LECs that have been activated by T cell–derived pro-inflammatory 
cytokines can inhibit T cell proliferation through the production of molecules such as IDO, 
TGF-β, and NO, which suppress T cell activation. (C) LECs can directly present endogenous 
PTAs and cross-present exogenous antigens to naive CD8+ T cells to induce dysfunctional 
T cell activation and tolerance due to expression of the inhibitory receptor PD-L1 and lack of 
co-stimulatory molecules on the surface of LECs.

downregulated, promoting retention of differentiating T cells in 
the LN. Following clonal expansion, activated effector and memo￾ry T cells downregulate CCR7 and CD62L and upregulate S1PR1, 
promoting migration to cortical sinuses (84). Within the cortical 
sinuses, fluid flow also promotes egress of T cells into efferent 
lymphatic vessels (85).
While the kinetics of LN egress differs between naive and activated 
T cells, both are mediated by LECs. Preliminary evidence of this role 
was provided by studies that demonstrated that, although hemato￾poietic cells in the periphery produce S1P, radio-resistant cells were 
responsible for S1P production in the LN cortical sinus and efferent 
lymphatics, implicating a non-hematopoietic cellular source of S1P 
(86). Further studies utilized mice with deficiencies in S1P produc￾tion by LYVE-1+ lymphatics to establish LECs as the source of S1P in 
these tissues. In the absence of S1P production by LECs, lymphocyte 
egress from LNs did not occur (87).
During inflammation, lymphocyte egress is transiently shut 
down but returns to steady-state levels in cases of prolonged 
inflammation. This restoration in homeostasis is reliant on LECs, 
as preferential lymphangiogenic expansion of the cortical and 
medullary sinuses facilitates lymphocyte egress during the late 
stages of inflammation (88).
Collectively, these studies demonstrate the pivotal role of 
LECs in controlling the homeostasis of the T cell pool. This 
is accomplished by coordinated regulation of T cell survival 
though IL-7 signaling and by guiding the dissemination of 
T cells through production of S1P. Future studies may uncover 
additional pathways by which LECs and T cells interact under 
normal and diseased states.
Clinical significance and future directions for the field
From a clinical standpoint, an appreciation for interactions been 
LECs and T cells will be important in several contexts. A major 
hurdle in the development of cancer immunotherapies is over￾coming suppression of anti-tumor T cell responses (89). Evidence 
reviewed here implicates the lymphatic endothelium in this sup￾pression, which is further exacerbated by lymphangiogenesis in the 
tumor context (59). Investigating anti-lymphangiogenic therapies 
may be one way to counter this suppression, thereby improving 
the efficacy of anti-cancer immunotherapy. HIV presents another 
example of the potential of therapeutics that target the lymphatic 
endothelium. In chronic HIV infection, the LN suffers structural 
damage from inflammation and collagen deposition (90). It is like￾ly that damage to the LN stroma interferes with the regulation of 
T cell homeostasis by LECs and exacerbates the lymphopenia that 
is characteristic of progressive HIV disease. In this case, it might be 
necessary to develop interventions that maintain LN architecture 
and promote functional interactions between T cells and LNSCs.
In summary, recent studies of lymphatic phenotype and func￾tion have demonstrated that LECs are capable of directly shap￾ing the adaptive immune response through influencing immune 
cell trafficking, promoting T cell tolerance, and mediating 
T cell homeostasis. Furthermore, activated T cells appear to reg￾ulate LEC expansion and function in settings of inflammation. 
It remains to be seen whether LECs can present antigen to CD4+
T cells and what type of response is initiated under those circum￾stances. In addition, there is a paucity of information on the inter￾actions between LECs and B cells that can modulate immunity. 
These interactions need to be further delineated to better under￾stand the dynamics of humoral immunity during health and dis￾ease. Future development of immunotherapies should consider 
the pivotal role of lymphatics in shaping immunity and regulating 
homeostasis of innate and adaptive immune subsets.
