Abstract
Background: To evaluate oncological and clinical outcome in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and tumor
thrombus involving inferior vena cava (IVC) treated with nephrectomy and thrombectomy.
Methods: We identified 50 patients with a median age of 65 years, who underwent radical surgical treatment for
RCC and tumor thrombus of the IVC between 1997 and 2010. The charts were reviewed for pathological and
surgical parameters, as well as complications and oncological outcome.
Results: The median follow-up was 26 months. In 21 patients (42%) distant metastases were already present at the
time of surgery. All patients underwent radical nephrectomy, thrombectomy and lymph node dissection through a
flank (15 patients/30%), thoracoabdominal (14 patients/28%) or midline abdominal approach (21 patients/42%),
depending upon surgeon preference and upon the characteristics of tumor and associated thrombus. Extracorporal
circulation with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was performed in 10 patients (20%) with supradiaphragmal
thrombus of IVC. Cancer-specific survival for the whole cohort at 5 years was 33.1%. Survival for the patients
without distant metastasis at 5 years was 50.7%, whereas survival rate in the metastatic group at 5 years was 7.4%.
Median survival of patients with metastatic disease was 16.4 months.
On multivariate analysis lymph node invasion, distant metastasis and grading were independent prognostic factors.
There was no statistically significant influence of level of the tumor thrombus on survival rate. Indeed, patients with
supradiaphragmal tumor thrombus (n = 10) even had a better outcome (overall survival at 5 years of 58.33%) than
the entire cohort.
Conclusions: An aggressive surgical approach is the most effective therapeutic option in patients with RCC and
any level of tumor thrombus and offers a reasonable longterm survival. Due to good clinical and oncological
outcome we prefer the use of CPB with extracorporal circulation in patients with supradiaphragmal tumor
thrombus. Cytoreductive surgery appears to be beneficial for patients with metastatic disease, especially when
consecutive therapy is performed. Although sample size of our study cohort is limited consistent with some other
studies lymph node invasion, distant metastasis and grading seem to have prognostic value.

Background
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) represents 3% of all solid
neoplasms seen in humans [1]. In Europe, the annual in￾cidence of RCC is approximately 2% with increased inci￾dence of small, localized tumors. Despite recent stage
migration the detection rate of advanced-stage disease
has not diminished [2]. Involvement of the renal vein or/
and the inferior vena cava (IVC) has been reported in
4%-10% [3,4] of patients. When it occurs without evi￾dence of lymph node involvement or distant metastasis,
surgery offers the only potential cure [5]. Meanwhile,
there are several reports of larger series of patients who
underwent radical surgery for RCC with inferior vena
caval involvement, with reported 5-year survival rates of
34% to 72% [4,6,7]. The role of nephrectomy and
thrombectomy in case of lymph node involvement or

distant metastasis is not well defined [4,6]. In symptom￾atic patients (intractable edema, cardiac dysfunction, ab￾dominal pain, hematuria) removal of tumor thrombus
may provide better quality of life, even if it does not cure
the patient [1]. Combination of cytoreductive surgery
and targeted therapy may prolong survival [8,9]. The po￾tential value of using multitargeted receptor tyrosine
kinase inhibitors in adjuvant or even neoadjuvant setting
is unclear.
Prognostic significance of the cephalad extension of
the tumor thrombus has been discussed extensively and
controversially in the literature, and it is difficult to com￾pare various series because of differences in selection of
patients and related covariables [10]. Although some
series have indicated it may be a negative prognostic fac￾tor [3,11], other authors report no difference in survival
of patients with supradiaphragmatic versus infradiaph￾ragmatic tumor thrombi as long as the tumor is other￾wise confined [12].
The present study reports our experience of surgical
treatment of patients with RCC and venous thrombus of
the IVC, with a particular focus on clinical and onco￾logical outcomes.
Materials and methods
From April 1997 to March 2010 50 patients, 36 men
and 14 women, with a mean age of 65 years (47 to 85 y.)
underwent resection of a RCC with extension of tumor
thrombus into the IVC (Stage T3b/c according to UICC
2002). The charts of our patients were reviewed retro￾spectively for demographics, clinical presentation, pre￾operative staging and laboratory values (hemoglobin,
thrombocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C re￾active protein (CRP)), pathology as well as surgical para￾meters (operation time, number of blood transfusions,
complications, hospitalisation time). Long-term follow￾up data were collected during check-up visits and add￾itional telephone interviews with the urologist of the
patient. Because patients were treated according to the
guidelines and current state of art a statement of ethical
approval is not required.
Preoperatively, all patients underwent routine blood
tests, ultrasound, chest and abdominal computed tom￾ography (CT) and/or abdominal magnetic resonance im￾aging (MRI) and/or bone scintigraphy. Clinical and
pathological staging was performed using the TNM clas￾sification (2002 TNM classification of malignant tumors
(UICC), 6th edition). Tumor grade was classified accord￾ing to the Fuhrman grading system [13].
The level of tumor thrombus was classified according
to the Mayo classification [14] (Table 1). 5 patients
(10%) had a level I tumor thrombus in the IVC, 16
(32%) a level II thrombus, 19 (38%) a level III thrombus,
and 10 (20%) a level IV thrombus (Figure 1A).
Surgical and therapeutic approach
All patients underwent radical nephrectomy, thrombec￾tomy and lymph node dissection through a flank (15
patients/30%), thoracoabdominal (14 patients/28%) or
midline abdominal approach (21 patients/42%), depend￾ing upon surgeon preference and upon the characteris￾tics of tumor and associated thrombus.
11 patients (22%) were operated in cooperation with
the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery of the Univer￾sity Hospital Wuerzburg. To access the right atrium in
these patients sternotomy was performed. Extracorporal
circulation with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was per￾formed in 10 patients (20%) with supradiaphragmal
thrombus of IVC. In one patient with Level III thrombus
CPB was planned but intraoperatively assumed as not
necessary.
Partial resection and replacement of IVC was neces￾sary in 5 cases. One patient additionally to radical neph￾rectomy and thrombectomy required resection of the
left hemicolon because of tumorinfiltration (Figure 1B).
Postoperatively, 17 patients (34%) received cytokine
treatment and 3 (6%) were treated by multitargeted
therapy.
One patient was treated neoadjuvantly with tyrosin
kinase inhibitor.
Statistic analysis
Actuarial patient survival and disease-free survival were
estimated using Kaplan-Meier method. Subgroup dif￾ferences were tested by two sided log-rank tests. The
prognostic significance of certain factors was assessed
by the Cox proportional hazards regression model. In
all tests p < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical
significance. Statistical calculations were carried out
using SPSS (version15.0).
Results
38 tumors originated from the right kidney and 12 from
the left. Median tumor size was 10.1 cm (range 5 to
17 cm). Involvement of the IVC wall (histologically
proven infiltration) was discovered in 14 patients (28%).
In 21 patients (42%) distant metastases were already
present at time of surgery. The lung was the most preva￾lent location of metastases in 14 (28%) cases, in two
cases combined with other locations (bone and liver). 5
patients (10%) had extrapulmonary metastasis (1 liver, 1
adrenal gland, 1 mediastinal lymphnodes, 2 brain). The
tumor was symptomatic in 35 patients (70%), whereas
15 (30%) had incidental findings. Most common
observed presenting symptoms were gross hematuria
(28%), flank or abdominal pain (22%) and systemic signs
(18%). Three patients presented with edema of lower
limbs and one patient with pulmonary embolism. One
patient (67-year-old male) presented with solid mass

(3.5 cm) in his left kidney and tumor thrombus Level III
with caudal extension into both iliacal veins, on the left
side even into the femoral vein. Due to extension of
tumor thrombus and comorbidity (chronic renal failure,
COPD, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity) he was
assessed as inoperable and treated with tyrosine kinase
inhibitors for 5 weeks (sorafenib 400 mg twice daily). Re￾staging showed no change of the solid mass of left kid￾ney, but complete reduction of tumor thrombus and
obliteration of IVC. Thereafter surgical resection was
performed successfully. Table 2A lists the characteristics
of the study population.
Mean operative time was 4.4 hours (2.25 – 10 h). 38
patients received blood transfusion, with a mean of 4.5
units (0 to 13). The mean hospital stay was 19 days (11 to
33). There was no intra- or perioperative (30-day post￾operative period) death. In three patients relaparatomy
was performed because of acute retroperitoneal
hemorrhage. In addition two patients were reported with
postoperative hematoma with wound infection, one pa￾tient with pericardial effusion and one patient with ileus.
Conservative management was possible in all of these 4
patients. Beside this according to the Clavien classification
[15] no complications, especially no pulmonary embolism,
have been observed. Depending on the approach we
observed 5 complications in patients who underwent ster￾notomy and abdominal midline incision, including 2 rela￾parotomies, 1 hematoma, 1 pericardial effusion, 1 ileus. 1
relaparatomy was necessary after an abdominal midline
incision and 1 hematoma, respectively wich was seen after
a flank incision. Complications are presented in Table 2B.
Histopathological examination revealed RCC of clear
cell variety in 39 patients (78%), papillary in 7 (14%), sar￾comatoid in 2 and mixed in 2. There were lymphnode
metastases in 12 patients (24%).
The median follow-up was 26 months (1 to
127 months). 30 deaths have been observed so far, 29 of
them due to tumor progression. Cancer-specific survival
for the whole cohort at 1, 2 and 5 years was 76.9%,
61.6% and 33.1%, respectively. Survival for the patients
without distant metastasis at time of surgery was 85.9%,
74.7% and 50.7% (median survival 31 months), whereas
survival rates in the metastatic group were 63.3%, 42.2%
and 7.4%, as shown in Figure 2A. Median survival of this
group was 16.4 months (493 days).
Univariate analysis showed that lymph node invasion
(p = 0,00007), distant metastasis (p = 0.026), grading
(p = 0,042), infiltration of perirenal tissue (p = 0,035), infil￾tration of vena cava wall (p = 0,012), tumor size
(p = 0,019) and CRP (p = 0,014) were statistically signifi￾cant predictors for survival (Table 2C). On multivariate
Cox regression analyses grading (p = 0.021), distant me￾tastasis (p = 0.00091) and lymph node invasion
(p = 0.000003) remained statistically independent prog￾nostic factors, as summarized in Table 2D.
There was no statistically significant influence of level of
the tumor thrombus on survival rate (Figure 2B and 2C).
Indeed, the subgroup of patients with supradiaphragmal

of diagnosis compared to 47.5% (19 of 40 patients) in the
group of patients with infradiaphragmal tumor thrombus
and primary metastatic disease.
The patient, mentioned above who was given neoadju￾vant therapy with tyrosin kinase inhibitor (Sorafenib)
featured pathologically a 5.5 cm clear cell RCC with
signs of tumor regression, Fuhrman grade 2. Surpris￾ingly, renal vein appeared recanalised without tumor
thrombus (no histological evidence of malignancy).
Discussion
In patients with locally advanced RCC an aggressive sur￾gical approach is the only hope for curing. RCC extend￾ing to IVC presents a challenging surgical management
problem. In patients with non-metastatic RCC and IVC
involvement the 5-year survival rates range between 34%
and 72% [4,6,7]. Cancio et al. reported a 5-year disease￾free survival rate of 54.5% for N0M0 disease [16]. In our
series the 5-year cancer-specific survival rate for patients
without metastases is 50.7%, which is comparable to
other studies.
Approximately one third of patients with RCC and
associated tumor thrombus also show distant metastases
at time of presentation. In our patient-cohort 42% of the
patients with thrombus in the IVC presented with simul￾taneous metastases, a percentage which is higher than in
other series. Cianco et al. reported median time to death
of 8 months and a longest survival of 27 months in
patients with metastatic disease [16]. Staehler and Brko￾vic reported median survival of 13 months and 2-year
survival rate of 26% for this group [6]. In our analysis,
17 of 21 patients with metastatic disease died, whereas 4
patients (follow-up 1, 32, 32, 127 months) still are alive.
2-year survival rate was 42.2%, median time to death
16.4 months with a range of 1.5 to 52 months.
Several authors do not advise radical surgery for
patients with metastatic disease and thrombus of the
IVC, believing that the limited chance of longer sur￾vival did not justify the morbidity of such an extensive
operation [17,18]. In a study of Lambert et al. patients
with metastatic disease did not experience any added
morbidity or mortality compared to patients without
metastatic disease [19]. In two randomized trials, on
the other hand, cytoreductive nephrectomy has
demonstrated improved survival for patients with
metastatic RCC treated additionally with interferon
[20,21]. Although a survival advantage for cytoreduc￾tive nephrectomy in combination with targeted therap￾ies has not yet been confirmed in the setting of
clinical trial, the multimodal strategy has also been
extrapolated to the era of targeted therapy [8,9,22].

setting is not defined. Especially patients with a pri￾mary unresectable tumor thrombus could possibly
benefit from neoadjuvant targeted therapies. Lately,
some cases of tumor and thrombus regression followed
by secondary operability after neoadjuvant therapy with
tyrosinkinase inhibitors have been reported [23]. In
our cohort 1 patient with an initially unresectable
tumor thrombus Level III was treated successfully by
neoadjuvant administration of tyrosin kinase inhibitor
(Sorafenib). These observations might be a signal to
re-evaluate the paradigm for the management of
advanced RCC especially with venous involvement.
The integration of targeted therapy in a neoadjuvant
setting for downstaging is an very interesting objective,
considering the potential for decreased perioperative
morbidity [22]. However, the benefit of neoadjuvant
therapy can only be studied further within a multicen￾ter clinical trial setting.
Several studies are concerned with prognostic factors
of patients with RCC and associated thrombus in IVC.
In a number of studies lymph node invasion and distant
metastases were described as independent prognostic
factors and their presence is known to reduce survival
not only in patients with venous involvement
[3,10,12,16,17]. Leibovich et al. identified the presence of
perinephric fat invasion in patients with tumor
thrombus as an independent prognostic factor [10]. In a
recent multicenter study Wagner et. al reviewed data of
1192 patients, who underwent radical nephrectomy for
T3b and T3c RCCs and reported besides IVC invasion,
fat invasion, lymphnode and distant metastasis on tumor
size as an additional independent prognostic factor [24].
Certainly, our study sample is limited and conclusions of
independent prognostic factors can only be drawn care￾fully. But consistent with other studies [3,6,24], on
multivariate analyses lymph node invasion, distant me￾tastases and tumor grade seemed to be of prognostic
relevance.
One of the most controversial topics in treatment of
IVC tumor thrombus in RCC has been the level of
thrombus and its prognostic impact on survival. The
most recent TNM classification (2010) distinguishes be￾tween T3b tumors that extend into the IVC or its wall
below the diaphragm and T3c tumors that extend into
the IVC or its wall above the diaphragm. Some studies
showed a negative impact on survival in patients with
tumor thrombus involving the IVC, in particular in
those with a higher cephaled extension [3,11,25]. Other
reports suggest that tumor thrombus extension into the
IVC is not necessarily associated with a worse prognosis
[12,24,26]. The presence of IVC invasion, not the level
of tumor thrombus, was identified as an independent
prognostic factor in some series [24,27]. Wagner et al.
[24] reported on statistically different overall survival for
patients with tumor thrombus in the renal vein com￾pared to those with IVC involvement, whereas the level
of tumor thrombus in the IVC did not significantly
affect the overall survival. In our series there was no sig￾nificant influence of the level of tumor thrombus on sur￾vival. In fact, the subgroup of patients with a level IV
tumor thrombus (n = 10), who required surgery with car￾diopulmonary bypass, had a better outcome. This cer￾tainly is due to patient selection, considering that only 2
of the 10 patients had distant metastases at time of diag￾nosis compared to 47.5% (19 of 40 patients) with meta￾static disease in the group of patients with infradiaphragmal
tumor thrombus. Furthermore the subgroup of patients
with supradiaphragmal tumor thrombus even had a better
outcome than patients without distant metastases (n = 29)
with a survival rate at 5 years of 50,7%, which underlines
the safeness of the surgical approach including the use of
CPB for this group of patients.
Surgical management of patients with supradiaph￾ragmal tumor thrombus of the IVC has always been a
technically challenging operation for urologists.
According to literature, nephrectomy with vena caval
thrombectomy is associated with a perioperative mor￾tality rate of 3-16% [16,24,28]. Preoperative accurate
imaging is mandatory to guarantee optimal surgical
strategy. While clamping the infrahepatic IVC is usu￾ally well-tolerated, occlusion of the suprahepatic IVC
frequently causes severe hypotension due to the de￾crease in venous return. The use of CPB with or
without deep hypothermic circulatory arrest has been
used commonly as a standard procedure [29,30]. Al￾ternatively, the technique of venovenous bypass
described for orthotopic liver transplantation has also
been investigated for tumor thrombectomy during
radical nephrectomy with good results [31]. The group
from University of Miami described their success in
managing IVC thrombi in a special technique of liver
mobilisation and “milking” of the tumor thrombus to￾ward the cavotomy, while maintaining organ perfusion
[5]. Due to the low morbidity and mortality rate of
patients with supradiaphragmal tumor thrombus in
our cohort (no perioperative death and only 2 rela￾parotomies) we still favour cardiopulmonary bypass
for tumor thrombi above the hepatic veins. We did
not observe any other severe complications associated
with CPB, including perioperative coagulopathy, hep￾atic failure, neurologic dysfunction or postoperative
sepsis.
The present study is a retrospective review of a sin￾gle institutional experience and, as such, it is limited
by inherent biases. So, complication data might be
limited by the information available in the patients`
charts and value of multivariate analysis is limited by
sample size.

Conclusion
In the present study we show, as others have before, that
an aggressive surgical approach is the most effective
therapeutic option in patients with RCC at any level of
tumor thrombus and offers reasonable long-term sur￾vival. Due to low morbidity and mortality rate and the
good oncological outcome we prefer the use of CPB in
patients with supradiaphragmal tumor thrombus.
Cytoreductive surgery may even be beneficial for
patients with metastatic disease, especially when con￾secutive therapy - such as multitargeted approaches – is
performed. Consistent with other studies, on multivari￾ate analyses lymph node invasion, distant metastasis and
tumor grade seemed to be of prognostic relevance.
