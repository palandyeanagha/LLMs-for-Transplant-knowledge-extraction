Total withdrawal of immunosuppression (TIW) without causing
rejection has been reported in some stable liver recipients.1–3
Patient characteristics which predict this clinical tolerance have not
been determined. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has been reported
to reduce the risk of early graft rejection following hepatic and
cardiac transplantation.4 We conducted a double blind controlled
trial of UDCA therapy followed by TIW in 26 liver recipients to (a)
determine if UDCA would facilitate TIW, (b) assess the safety of
attempting TIW and (c) determine predictors of success of TIW.
Patients and methods
Records were reviewed and all patients who had been free of
rejection for a minimum of 2 years, and on single or double drug
