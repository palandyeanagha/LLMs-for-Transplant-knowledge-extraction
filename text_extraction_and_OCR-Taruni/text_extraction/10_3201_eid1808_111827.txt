During January–March 2011, diagnoses of hepatitis 
E virus (HEV) infection increased in Marseille University 
hospitals in southeastern France. HEV genotype 4, which 
is described almost exclusively in Asia, was recovered from 
2 persons who ate uncooked pork liver sausage. Genetic 
sequences were 96.7% identical to those recently described 
in swine in Europe.
I
n industrialized countries, most cases of hepatitis E virus 
(HEV) infection in humans are autochthonous (1). Pigs 
are a major reservoir of HEV, and transmission of virus to 
humans who ate raw or undercooked pork has been reported 
(1–3). In France, >300 cases of HEV infection are reported 
annually (3); most infections are autochthonous and occur 
in southern France, where the prevalence of anti-HEV IgG 
is higher than in northern France (3–5). Almost all cases 
of autochthonous HEV infection reported in Europe have 
involved genotype 3 strains (1–6).
Beginning February 21, 2011, a biosurveillance 
program (EPIMIC) (7) detected an increase in the number 
of HEV infections diagnosed at Marseille University 
hospitals in southeastern France. During February 21–
March 28, the weekly number of serum samples that were 
tested and found positive for HEV was above the elected 
critical threshold (online Technical Appendix Figure 1, 
wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/pdfs/11-1827-Techapp.pdf).
The Cases
In Marseille during January–March 2011, a total of 
11 cases of HEV infection were confi rmed by anti-HEV 
IgM testing and detection of HEV RNA in serum samples. 
EIAgen assays (Adaltis Italia, Casalecchio di Reno, Italy) 
were used to detect anti-HEV IgM and IgG. Additional anti￾HEV IgM testing was performed by using the Assure HEV 
IgM Rapid Test (MP Biomedicals, Illkirch, France) and 
the recomLine HEV IgG/IgM test (Mikrogen Diagnostik, 
Neuried, Germany). HEV RNA was detected by using a 
real-time reverse transcription PCR targeting open reading 
frame (ORF) 2 (2).
The mean age of the case-patients was 57 years (±11 
years). Of the 11 case-patients, 10 were male and 3 were 
kidney transplant recipients (Tables 1, 2). HEV infection 
was clinically asymptomatic in all transplant recipients; 
the infection was diagnosed after routine posttransplant 
laboratory tests showed elevated levels of liver enzymes. 
Longitudinal testing indicated chronic HEV infection in 1 
case-patient (no. 5), and an 80-year-old case-patient died 9 
weeks after disease onset.
HEV 5′-ORF2 RNA was recovered from the serum 
of 8 case-patients. Phylogenetic analysis (2) showed 
that 4 patients each had HEV genotype 3c or 3f (online 
Technical Appendix Figure 2). Sequences from 2 
unrelated case-patients (nos. 7, 8) showed 99.8% identity; 
for other pairwise comparisons, maximal identity was 
93.4% (mean 83.6%).
We could not recover HEV 5′-ORF2 RNA from the 
serum of 3 case-patients (nos. 1, 2, 6). For case-patient 
6, this could be explained by a low viral load. When 
targeting ORF1 and 3′-ORF2, we recovered HEV genotype 
4 (HEV-4) from serum samples from case-patients 1 and 
2 (Figure; online Technical Appendix Figure 3) (5,10). 
Molecular testing results for these samples were checked in 
duplicate and by testing different serum samples from the 
same case-patients. HEV-4 RNA from the 2 case-patients 
showed 100% identity for ORF1 and 99.8% identity for 
ORF2. The next closest match (96.7% identity) was the 
fi rst HEV-4 RNA in swine reported in Europe (GenBank 
accession no. HQ857384) (Figure) (8). The next 2 closest 
matches (91.0%–91.3% identity) were recovered from 
swine in China (GenBank accession nos. EU676172 and 
DQ279091) (Figure). However, the sequences showed only 
86.0% identity with a genotype 4f HEV RNA recovered 
from a patient in Germany (9).
None of the 11 case-patients had traveled abroad 
during the 2–9 weeks before hepatitis onset. Of the 11 
case-patients, 6 (55%), including the 2 with HEV-4, ate 
uncooked pig liver sausage (fi gatelli [2]) (Table 2). The 2 
patients with HEV-4 were not related. Because 4 contacts 
of the 2 HEV-4–infected case-patients also ate some of 
the fi gatelli eaten by the case-patients (Tables 1, 2), we 
investigated whether these contacts had markers for HEV 
infection. Test results for anti-HEV IgM were positive for 
the wife of case-patient 1 and a friend of case-patient 2; 
the HEV PCR result was barely positive for contact 1a, 
who had an elevated level of alanine aminotransferase (165 
IU/L; reference <45 IU/L). These 2 persons were clinically 
asymptomatic.

Conclusions
We report a concurrent rise in testing for and diagnoses 
of HEV infections in Marseille during January–March 2011. 
This rise may refl ect increased clinician awareness of HEV 
or an increased incidence of HEV infection that may have 
resulted from the use of improved tools for HEV diagnosis.
In industrialized countries, HEV has increasingly 
been recognized as a possible cause of hepatitis in 
diverse clinical settings, including in solid-organ 
transplant recipients. In our study, 3 (27%) of the case￾patients were solid-organ transplant recipients. This 
number suggests a high incidence of HEV infection 
among transplant recipients in the geographic area we 
studied, and it is consistent with the incidence (≈3.2/100 
person-years) of HEV infection among organ transplant 
recipients in Toulouse in southwestern France (4). Liver

Hepatitis E Virus Genotype 4 in France
biochemical testing is routinely performed after organ 
transplantation; such testing enabled the detection of 
subclinical HEV infection in the 3 transplant recipients 
reported here. Subclinical HEV infection can also occur 
in immunocompetent persons (1,11,12); thus, we question 
whether the incidence of HEV infection among transplant 
recipients in southern France might refl ect that in the 
general population. Moreover, 52% of adult blood donors 
sampled in southwestern France in 2003–2004 were 
retrospectively shown to be HEV seropositive by using a 
newly available assay (4), and HEV was retrospectively 
shown to be an underdiagnosed cause of liver injury in the 
United States and United Kingdom (13).
A considerable proportion of HEV infections in 
southern France may be linked to the consumption of 
uncooked fi gatelli, which has been identifi ed as a source of 
zoonotic foodborne HEV transmission (2,4). In our study, 
55% of the HEV-positive patients reported eating uncooked 
fi gatelli, and in another study in France, 2 HEV-positive 
patients reported eating uncooked fi gatelli (11). These 
cases indicate insuffi cient prevention of HEV transmission 
to humans through uncooked fi gatelli consumption (2).
The major fi nding in our study was the recovery 
of HEV-4 sequences from 2 of 6 case-patients who ate 
uncooked fi gatelli purchased in southern France. These 
sequences were closely related to the sequence for the fi rst￾reported HEV-4 RNA in swine in Europe (8), which was 
recovered in Belgium and classifi ed as genotype 4b. HEV￾4 is indigenous to Asia, where it has been recovered from 
pigs and humans (1,6,14). For the 2 HEV-4 RNA sequences 
obtained in our study, the best matches among sequences 
from Asia were from HEV strains from swine in China. 
Since its fi rst report in China in 1999, HEV-4 has been 
increasingly described as endemic in pigs and involved 
in most sporadic cases of hepatitis E (1,14). Several HEV 
subtypes have been described in China, including subtype 
4b (1,6,14). In Europe, autochthonous infection with a 
genotype 4f HEV in a person in Germany was reported 
in 2008 (9), and a case of HEV-4 infection acquired in 
India was reported for a person in England in 2010 (15). 
Studies in China have shown relatedness between HEV-4 
sequences recovered from humans and swine in the same 
geographic area, which suggests zoonotic transmission (1). 
Moreover, sequences for HEV-4 RNA recovered from a 
father and son in Japan who ate barbecued pig meat were 
almost identical, and sequences were identical for HEV-4 
RNA from packaged pig liver sold in a grocery store and 
from a patient in whom HEV infection developed after the 
person ate grilled pig liver (1,2).
Together with previous fi ndings, our results bring up 
the question as to whether HEV-4 was introduced into 
domestic pigs or whether pig meat of Asian origin was 
introduced into France. Moreover, it prompts a study of 
whether HEV-4 strains circulate and spread in Europe as 
an effect of globalization of HEV zoonosis.

the tree. The avian HEV sequence AM943646 was used as an 
outgroup. Scale bar indicates nucleotide substitutions per site.
