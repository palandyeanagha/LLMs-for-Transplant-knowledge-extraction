Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) enables viability assessment of donor livers prior to transplantation. NMP is fre￾quently performed by using human blood products including red blood cells (RBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Our
aim was to examine the efficacy of a novel machine perfusion solution based on polymerized bovine hemoglobin-based
oxygen carrier (HBOC)-201. Twenty-four livers declined for transplantation were transported by using static cold storage.
Upon arrival, livers underwent NMP for 6 hours using pressure-controlled portal and arterial perfusion. A total of 12 liv￾ers were perfused using a solution based on RBCs and FFPs (historical cohort), 6 livers with HBOC-201 and FFPs, and
another 6 livers with HBOC-201 and gelofusine, a gelatin-based colloid solution. Compared with RBC 1 FFP perfused
livers, livers perfused with HBOC-201 had significantly higher hepatic adenosine triphosphate content, cumulative bile
production, and portal and arterial flows. Biliary secretion of bicarbonate, bilirubin, bile salts, and phospholipids was simi￾lar in all 3 groups. The alanine aminotransferase concentration in perfusate was lower in the HBOC-201–perfused groups.
In conclusion, NMP of human donor livers can be performed effectively using HBOC-201 and gelofusine, eliminating
the need for human blood products. Perfusing livers with HBOC-201 is at least similar to perfusion with RBCs and FFP.
Some of the biomarkers of liver function and injury even suggest a possible superiority of an HBOC-201–based perfusion
solution and opens a perspective for further optimization of machine perfusion techniques.

Liver transplantation is the only curative treatment
option for end-stage liver disease. Unfortunately, a
global discrepancy exists between the availability and
need for human donor livers, resulting in substantial
wait-list mortality.(1) Over the past decades, machine
perfusion has been gaining interest as a promising tool
for expanding the human donor liver pool.(2)
Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) is a tech￾nique whereby human donor livers are perfused ex situ
at 378C. This technique can be used for the entire period
of preservation, as is currently being evaluated in a clini￾cal trial by Friend et al. in Oxford,(3) and for viability
assessment of the organ prior to transplantation.(4-6) In
this manner, only well-functioning organs are trans￾planted, including those that initially may have been
declined for transplantation. Furthermore, NMP has the
potential to allow for the resuscitation of donor livers.
NMP is generally performed using a perfusion solu￾tion based on packed red blood cells (RBCs).(3,7-9) The
NMP solution requires an adequate oxygen carrier to
deliver oxygen throughout the organ, as well as physio￾logical osmolarity and oncotic pressure. Previous NMP
perfusions at our center were performed using matched
packed RBCs and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) obtained
from the blood bank, with the addition of nutrients and

antibiotics.(7) Other centers have performed NMP with
RBCs and gelofusine(3,8) or Steen solution,(9) and 1 pre￾vious study has also performed hemoglobin-based oxy￾gen carrier (HBOC)-201 and gelofusine.(10)
The use of human blood products is expensive and
logistically challenging due to their short preservation
time and need for matching. Furthermore, human
blood products are scarce and carry the risk of transmit￾ting blood borne infections. For these ethical, financial,
and logistical reasons it would be favorable to avoid the
use of RBCs and FFPs for NMP. Consequently, the
aim of the current study was to design a perfusion solu￾tion for NMP that circumvents the use of human blood
products. We did this by replacing RBCs with HBOC￾201 (Hemopure, HbO2 Therapeutics LLC, Souderton,
PA), a bovine-derived free hemoglobin (Hb) oxygen
carrier, and FFPs with gelofusine, a widely used com￾mercially available colloid solution.
Patients and Methods
ORGAN PROCUREMENT
The present study was performed at the University Medi￾cal Center Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands, and
was approved by the medical ethical committee of the
institute. Between July 2012 and July 2015, 24 human
donor livers that were declined for transplantation were
included after consent for research had been obtained from
relatives. All donor livers were procured using the standard
technique of in situ cooling and flush out with ice-cold
preservation solution (University of Wisconsin [UW] or
histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate [HTK] solution, in line
with the national organ procurement protocol), as has pre￾viously been described.(11) Livers were packed in ice-cold
preservation solution (UW or HTK), stored on ice, and
transported to our center. Upon arrival, an experienced
liver surgeon performed the back-table preparation and
cannulated the portal vein, supratruncal aorta, and bile
duct for machine perfusion. Meanwhile, the machine per￾fusion device was set up and primed, and machine perfu￾sion was commenced as soon as possible.
STUDY GROUPS
Twelve donor livers were perfused with RBCs and FFPs
(RBC 1 FFP group). Subsequently, 6 livers were per￾fused with HBOC-201 and FFPs (HBOC-201 1 FFP
group), and thereafter, 6 livers were perfused with
HBOC-201 and gelofusine (HBOC-201 1 gelofusine
group). Because of the scarcity of available donor livers at
our research center, we used a cohort of livers that had
already been perfused and previously published (RBC 1
FFP group).(11) Perfusions in the 3 study groups were not
randomized but instead performed consecutively. All per￾fusions were performed in the presence of the principal
investigator, and after having optimized our perfusion
technique extensively before including any of the liver
grafts of the present study, no changes were made in per￾fusion technique.
OXYGEN CARRIER HBOC-201
The HBOC-201 oxygen carrier solution contains
polymerized Hb, which is much smaller than a human
erythrocyte, is less viscous than RBCs, and has the
ability to release oxygen more easily than human
Hb.(12) This gives it the ability to perfuse tissues more
deeply and oxygenate more remote regions.(12) Because
of the extraction and purification process, potential
contaminants including plasma proteins, endotoxins,
bacteria, viruses, and the prions responsible for bovine
spongiform encephalopathy and variant Creutzfeld￾Jakob disease are removed, resulting in a sterile,
pyrogen-free solution.(13) The in vivo half-life of
HBOC-201 is approximately 20 hours.(13) A downside
to the use of HBOC-201 is the potential formation of
methemoglobin (metHb). However, the small amount

of HBOC-201 that would reach the recipient in a
transplantation setting is minimal as the perfusion
solution would be washed out prior to transplanta￾tion.(13) Lastly, HBOC-201 cannot be spun down and
therefore renders the perfusate colored red, which may
interfere with spectrophotometric analyses.(14)
MACHINE PERFUSION SOLUTION
The perfusion solutions of the 3 study groups were
based on 3 main components:
1. An oxygen carrier, provided by either 3 units of
RBCs or 4 units of HBOC-201 (Hemopure, HbO2
Therapeutics LLC), both with a total of 120 g Hb.
2. A colloid solution, consisting of either 3 units of
FFP supplemented with 100 mL 20% human albu￾min or 500 mL 4% gelofusine (B Braun, Melsun￾gen, Germany) supplemented with 250 mL 20%
human albumin.
3. Additional supplements containing nutrients, trace
elements, antibiotics, vitamins, insulin, and hepa￾rin as described previously.(7)
The total volume of perfusion solution was similar
in all 3 groups and approximately 2200 mL. All blood
products were supplied by Sanquin, the Dutch blood
bank, and were not expired. In each perfusion solution,
the colloid oncotic pressure and osmolarity were tar￾geted to reach physiological levels. Prior to connecting
the liver, the pH of the perfusion fluid was optimized.
NORMOTHERMIC MACHINE
PERFUSION
The Liver Assist (Organ Assist, Groningen, the Nether￾lands) machine perfusion device was used. It simulates
the physiological environment by providing pressure￾controlled pulsatile flow to the hepatic artery and continu￾ous flow to the portal vein and gravitational outflow
through the vena cava. The hepatic artery and portal vein
perfusion circuits are each composed of a rotary perfusion
pump, a membrane oxygenator with integrated heat
exchanger, and flow and pressure sensors.
The perfusion solution was maintained at 378C,
and NMP was performed for 6 hours. Pressures were
set at a mean of 70 mm Hg (systolic and diastolic
pressures 620%) on the arterial and 11 mm Hg on the
portal side. Perfusion fluid was oxygenated using a total
of 4 L/minute (95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide)
through the 2 oxygenators. Before NMP and every 30
minutes during NMP, samples of the arterial and
venous perfusion fluid, as well as bile samples, were
taken for analysis of blood gas parameters (pH, partial
pressure of oxygen [PO2], partial pressure of carbon
dioxide [PCO2], oxygen saturation [SO2], bicarbonate
[HCO3
2] lactate, glucose, and metHb) using an
ABL800 FLEX or ABL90 FLEX analyzer (Radio￾meter, Brønhøj, Denmark). If needed, sodium bicarbon￾ate (8.4% solution) was added to maintain a pH within
the physiological range of 7.35-7.45, as described previ￾ously.(7,15) Liver parenchyma wedge biopsies were taken
before and every 2 hours during NMP. Biopsies were
stored in formalin and embedded in paraffin, or snap￾frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 2808C. Bile pro￾duced by the liver was collected and measured every 30
minutes and stored at 2808C. Perfusion fluid samples
were collected every half hour and stored at 2808C
(after 5 minutes centrifugation at 2700 rpm at 48C).
ASSESSMENT OF HEPATOBILIARY
FUNCTION AND INJURY
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in liver parenchyma
biopsies was determined as described previously.(4)
To calculate the peak oxygen extraction, the differ￾ence between arterial and venous oxygen content was
calculated and corrected for the flow. The following
formula was used to calculate the oxygen content:
Oxygen content 5 (PO2 3 K) 1 (SO2 3 Hb 3 c),
where PO2 is the partial pressure of oxygen in kPa, K is a
constant (0.0225), SO2 is the oxygen saturation expressed
as a fraction (where 1.00 is 100% saturation), Hb is the
concentration in g/dL, and c is the oxygen binding capac￾ity of Hb (1.39 for human Hb; 1.26 for HBOC-201).
Total bilirubin concentration in bile was determined
using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) kit (Human Total Bilirubin ELISA
kit, #MBS756198, MyBioSource, Inc., San Diego,
CA) using a monoclonal anti-tublin beta (TBB) anti￾body and a TBB-HRP conjugate as indicated by the
manufacturer. Samples were applied undiluted. Color
intensity was measured spectrophotometrically at 450
nm using VersaMax ELISA microplate reader and
SoftMax Pro 5.4, and concentrations were calculated.
Total bile salt concentrations in bile were deter￾mined by adding 250 lL trisbuffer and 50 lL of the
reagent 3a-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (H1506-
50UN, Sigma-Aldrich) and resazurine (Acros Organ￾ics) to 10 lL (diluted 1:100) of each sample.(16) Fluo￾rescence was measured using a PerkinElmer Wallac
1420 Victor3 microplate reader and concentrations
were calculated.
MATTON ET AL. LIVER TRANSPLANTATION, April 2018

Phospholipid concentrations in bile were determined
by adding 150 lL of reagent out of a commercially
available Phospholipids kit (reference number 15741
9910 930, Diagnostic systems, GmbH, Holzheim, Ger￾many) to 10 lL (diluted 1:9) of each sample. Color
intensity was measured spectrophotometrically at a
wavelength of 570 nm (VersaMax Molecular devices) in
SoftMax Pro 5.4 and concentrations were calculated. In
order to calculate the biliary secretion of bicarbonate,
bilirubin, total bile salts, and phospholipids, their con￾centrations were multiplied by the volume of bile pro￾duced, corrected for the weight of the liver.
After centrifugation, perfusate samples were diluted
103 and analyzed for alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
using routine diagnostic laboratory procedures. Be￾cause HBOC-201 Hb is freely suspended in solution
and cannot be spun down, ALT concentrations in
the HBOC-201 groups were corrected for the 20%
hematocrit present in the RBC 1 FFP group by mul￾tiplying ALT values in the HBOC-201 groups by
1.25 (1/0.80 5 1.25).
Paraffin-embedded slides of liver biopsies were pre￾pared for hematoxylin-eosin (H & E) staining and
semiquantitatively assessed using the Suzuki liver
injury scoring system.(17) All liver slides were examined
in a blinded fashion by an expert liver pathologist
(A.S.H.G.).
STATISTICS
Continuous variables are presented as median with
interquartile range (IQR); categorical variables are pre￾sented as absolute numbers. Continuous variables were
compared between groups by calculating the area under
the curve when indicated and the Kruskal-Wallis H or
Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction. Cat￾egorical variables were compared with the Fisher’s exact
test. The level of significance was set at a P value <0.05.
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS soft￾ware version 22.0 for Windows (IBM SPSS, Inc., Chi￾cago, IL) and Microsoft Excel 2010 for Windows.
Results
DONOR LIVER CHARACTERISTICS
Table 1 shows the donor liver characteristics in the 3
study groups. There were no significant differences in
donor liver characteristics between the groups. Nota￾bly, the number of livers discarded due to expected
steatosis (based on donor body mass index [BMI],
ultrasound, and laboratory results) was 5 in the RBC
1 FFP group compared with 0 and 1 in the HBOC￾201 1 FFP and HBOC-201 1 gelofusine groups,
respectively. However, the level of actual microscopic
steatosis, which was only known after the liver had
been offered for research, was much lower. Only 2
(17%) livers in the HBOC-201 1 FFP group, 0 in the
HBOC-201 1 FFP group, and 1 (17%) in the
HBOC-201 1 gelofusine group had a clinically rele￾vant degree of microscopic steatosis (>30%).
NORMOTHERMIC MACHINE
PERFUSION
Figure 1 shows photographs of NMP using RBC 1
FFP (Fig. 1A) and HBOC-201 1 gelofusine (Fig.
1B). The color of HBOC-201 is darker than that of
human blood. During 1 HBOC-201 1 FFP perfu￾sion, there was blood present in the bile and this liver
was consequently excluded for biliary analyses, as this
would result in the recording of falsely elevated bile
production. The fraction of metHb during NMP
reached maximally 0.02% in the RBC 1 FFP group,
0.22% in the HBOC-201 1 FFP group, and 0.28% in
the HBOC-201 1 gelofusine group (healthy human
adults range <1%).
HEMODYNAMICS
As shown in Fig. 2A, the portal vein flow increased dur￾ing the first hour of NMP and thereafter remained sta￾ble in all 3 groups. In both HBOC-201 groups, the
portal flow was significantly higher at each time point
compared with the RBC 1 FFP group, reaching a
median (IQR) of 848 (663-1393) mL/minute/kg liver
weight in the RBC 1 FFP group, 1890 (1530-2173) in
the HBOC-201 1 FFP group, and 1830 (1713-2030)
in the HBOC-201 1 gelofusine group at 6 hours of
NMP.
The hepatic artery flow was higher after the first 2
hours of NMP in both HBOC-201 groups compared
with the RBC 1 FFP group, reaching a median (IQR)
of 273 (231-327) mL/minute/kg liver weight in the
RBC 1 FFP group, 742 (480-867) mL/minute/kg
liver weight in the HBOC-201 1 FFP group, and 533
(187-741) mL/minute/kg liver weight in the HBOC￾201 1 gelofusine group at 6 hours NMP. The arterial
flow remained stable in the RBC 1 FFP group, con￾tinued to increase in the HBOC-201 1 FFP group,
and declined slightly after 3 hours of NMP for
unknown reasons in the HBOC-201 1 gelofusine

group (Fig. 2B). The total flow (portal 1 arterial),
however, remained stable in all 3 groups. This is in
line with the fact that the portal vein and hepatic artery
compete for blood flow (Fig. 2C). There were no
significant differences in either portal or arterial flow
between the 2 HBOC-201 groups. Furthermore, there
were no significant differences in resistance between
the 3 groups (data not shown). The higher flow rates,

despite equal pressures and resistance, in the HBOC￾201 groups can be explained by the fact that the viscos￾ity of the HBOC-201 perfusion fluid is lower than
that of the RBC perfusion fluid.
ATP CONTENT IN LIVER
PARENCHYMA
The median ATP content in liver parenchyma was
higher in both HBOC-201 groups at each time point
during NMP compared with the RBC 1 FFP group,
reaching significance at 2 time points (Fig. 3A). At 6
hours NMP, the median (IQR) ATP content was 24
(14-51) lmol/g protein in the RBC 1 FFP group, 50
(35-59) lmol/g protein in the HBOC-201 1 FFP
group, and 79 (50-103) lmol/g protein in the HBOC￾201 1 gelofusine group. Furthermore, the ATP con￾tent in the HBOC-201 1 gelofusine group was higher
at each time point compared with the HBOC-201 1
FFP group. However, this did not reach significance.
The normal value of ATP content in healthy livers
using our assay is approximately 60 lmol/g protein,
implying that physiological ATP levels were reached
during NMP with HBOC-201.
PEAK OXYGEN EXTRACTION
The peak oxygen extraction was higher in the HBOC￾201 perfused groups. However, this did not reach
statistical significance. The median (IQR) peak oxygen
extraction was 0.0014 (0.0010-0.0022) mL O2/minute/g
liver in the RBC 1 FFP group, 0.0023 (0.0020-0.0024)
mL O2/minute/g liver in the HBOC-201 1 FFP
group, and 0.0024 (0.0022-0.0033) mL O2/minute/g
liver in the HBOC-201 1 gelofusine group.
BILE PRODUCTION
After the second hour of NMP, the cumulative bile pro￾duction was significantly higher in the HBOC-201
groups compared with the RBC 1 FFP group, reaching
a median (IQR) of 8.2 (6.1-17.7) mL/kg liver weight in
the RBC 1 FFP group, 27.3 (26.6-31.2) mL/kg liver
weight in the HBOC-201 1 FFP group, and 29.0 (25.6-
39.4) mL/kg liver weight in the HBOC-201 1 gelofu￾sine group (P 5 0.04 and P 5 0.03, respectively) at 6
hours of NMP (Fig. 3B). There were no significant dif￾ferences between the 2 HBOC-201 groups.
BILIARY COMPOSITION
The biliary secretion of bicarbonate (marker for chol￾angiocyte function), bile salts, phospholipids, and
bilirubin (markers for hepatic function) were not sig￾nificantly different between the 3 groups (Fig. 3C).
LACTATE AND GLUCOSE

an approximately 2-fold higher median lactate con￾centration at 2 hours NMP in the RBC 1 FFP group
compared with the HBOC-201 perfused groups
(median [IQR] of 6.7 [4.1-10.0] mmol/L in the RBC
1 FFP group, 3.6 [1.8-10.3] in the HBOC-201 1
FFP and 2.6 [0.5-6.0] in the HBOC-201 1 gelofu￾sine group at 2 hours NMP). Although the differ￾ences did not reach significance, these data could
suggest that the HBOC-201 perfused livers have a
more adequate aerobic metabolism than the RBC 1
FFP perfused livers. The glucose concentration also
seemed to normalize more rapidly in the HBOC-201
perfused livers compared with the RBC 1 FFP per￾fused livers (Fig. 4B), though this did not reach
significance.
BUFFERING CAPACITY
The amount of bicarbonate that needed to be added to
the perfusion system was not statistically different
between the 3 groups. The median (IQR) volume of
8.4% sodium bicarbonate added during NMP was 20
(3-44) mL in the RBC 1 FFP group, 10 (10-10) mL
in the HBOC-201 1 FFP group, and 25 (10-40) mL
in the HBOC-201 1 gelofusine group.
ALT CONCENTRATION
IN THE PERFUSATION FLUID
The concentration of ALT in perfusate during NMP
was higher in the RBC 1 FFP group compared with

both HBOC-201 groups during NMP, nearly reach￾ing significance at 4 hours of NMP (both P 5 0.07)
and at 6 hours of NMP between the RBC 1 FFP and
HBOC-201 1 FFP groups (P 5 0.06; Fig. 5). The
median (IQR) ALT concentration at 6 hours NMP
was 5817 (2957-14,023) IU/L in the RBC 1 FFP
group, 2550 (942-5562) IU/L in the HBOC-201 1
FFP group, and 2418 (1968-3768) IU/L in the
HBOC-201 1 gelofusine group.
HISTOLOGICAL ANALYSIS
OF LIVER INJURY
The amount of histological injury of liver parenchyma
was not significantly different between the 3 groups
before or after NMP. The median (IQR) total Suzuki
injury score was 2.0 (1.0-3.0) before and 3.0 (2.0-4.3)
after NMP in the RBC 1 FFP group; 1.0 (1.0-1.0)
before and 2.0 (2.0-2.0) after NMP in the HBOC￾201 1 FFP group; and 1.5 (1.0-2.0) before and 2.5
(1.3-4.5) after NMP in the HBOC-201 1 gelofusine
group. The main factor contributing to the total injury
score was the degree of necrosis, with a median
increase of 1.0 point in each group, as is shown in rep￾resentative H & E–stained liver sections in Fig. 6.
Discussion
Machine perfusion is revolutionizing the field of organ
transplantation and, as it is rapidly making its way into
the clinic, is responsible for increases in the quality and
quantity of liver transplants. Finding an alternative to
using scarce, expensive, and logistically complex

human blood products for NMP is an important step
in making NMP more widely applicable and accessi￾ble. In this study, we have shown the following:
1. NMP can be effectively performed without the use
of human blood products by replacing RBCs with
HBOC-201, a polymerized bovine Hb, and FFPs
by gelofusine, a widely available colloid solution.
2. That perfusion with HBOC-201 is at least as
effective as with RBCs.
Some end points in our study indicate that an
HBOC-201–based perfusion fluid may even be superior,
as shown by the increased recovery of hepatic ATP con￾tent, bile production, and improved glucose and lactate
metabolism, as well as lower injury markers (ALT).
After having performed perfusions with RBCs and
FFPs, we first replaced RBCs with HBOC-201 and
kept FFPs, and subsequently also replaced FFPs with
gelofusine. The ATP content in liver parenchyma was
continuously higher in both HBOC-201 groups
compared with the RBC 1 FFPs group. Previous
research has shown that during static cold storage,
hepatic ATP levels are depleted and that these levels
can be restored during machine perfusion.(11,18) Livers
with higher ATP levels show significantly better out￾comes after transplantation, as has been validated in
several animal and clinical studies,(19-21) holding
great promise for future clinical perfusion with
HBOC-201.
A possible explanation for the higher ATP content
in liver parenchyma in the HBOC-201–perfused livers
lies in the properties of HBOC-201. The HBOC-201
molecule has a lower affinity for oxygen than human
Hb with a dissociation curve that is shifted to the right,
causing HBOC-201 to give off oxygen more read￾ily.(12) In addition, HBOC-201 solution is less viscous
and contains free Hb, which is much smaller than
erythrocytes, thereby allowing it to penetrate more
deeply into the tissue.(12) The peak oxygen extraction

also appeared higher in the HBOC-201 perfused
groups than in the RBC 1 FFP group, although this
did not reach significance.
Bile production is an ATP-dependent process. In line
with this, the cumulative bile production was also signifi￾cantly higher in both HBOC-201 groups compared with
the RBC 1 FFP group. According to the “viability
criteria” described by Sutton et al., 7 out of 12 livers in
the RBC 1 FFP group, 4 out of 5 in the HBOC-201 1
FFP group, and 6 out of 6 livers in the HBOC-201 1
gelofusine group would have potentially been transplant￾able.(4) Similarly, bile production is a transplantation cri￾terion established in a clinically validated group of livers
described by the Birmingham group.(22)
The amount of bicarbonate, bile salts, phospholi￾pids, and bilirubin secreted into bile was, however, not
significantly different between the 3 groups. Bile flow
is mainly driven by the secretion of bile salts, but a sig￾nificant part is also driven by bile salt–independent fac￾tors.(23) It could be possible that the secretion of other
molecules, such as HBOC-201 or derivatives thereof,
are hypercholeretic and thereby cause higher bile flow
with an altered bile composition.
Both the lactate and glucose concentrations in perfu￾sion fluid declined more rapidly in the HBOC-201–
perfused livers compared with the RBC 1 FFP–per￾fused livers, though this did not reach significance. This
may indicate that the HBOC-201–perfused livers were
able to metabolize lactate and glucose at least equally
well, or perhaps even better, as the RBC-perfused livers,
reflecting proper restoration of aerobic metabolism.
The HBOC-201–perfused livers consistently showed
significantly higher flows through the portal vein com￾pared with the RBC 1 FFP–perfused livers. Flow
through the hepatic artery was also consistently higher
in the HBOC-201–perfused groups, reaching signifi￾cance between the RBC 1 FFP and HBOC-201 1
gelofusine groups. The increased flow is likely a result of
the aforementioned lower viscosity of HBOC-201,
compared with human blood and not caused by a differ￾ence in intrahepatic resistance between the groups. The
size of HBOC-201 is 1 3 10-8 the size of an RBC.
This makes an HBOC-201–based perfusion fluid much
less viscous than an RBC-based fluid, resulting in
higher flows at a given intrahepatic resistance.
Interestingly, the concentration of the liver injury
marker, ALT, in perfusion fluid was consistently lower
in the HBOC-201 groups compared with the RBC 1
FFP group, despite no histological differences in the
amount of liver parenchyma injury. There were no sig￾nificant differences in donor parameters between the 3
groups; in fact, the DRI was even slightly higher in the
HBOC-201 1 gelofusine group. The number of livers
declined for transplantation due to expected steatosis
was higher in the RBC 1 FFP group. However, this
did not translate into a higher number of livers with
microscopically confirmed clinically relevant steatosis
and is therefore unlikely to have played a major role in
the results of the present study.
Two other studies have reported the use of HBOC￾201 in a machine perfusion setting. In the first study,
subnormothermic (218C) machine perfusion was com￾pared with static cold storage using pig donor livers.
The investigators noted significantly higher survival,
superior graft function, and bile production after liver
transplantation in the machine-perfused group com￾pared with static cold-stored livers.(24) The second
study compared NMP using RBCs with HBOC-201
and reported similar flows, lactate clearance, and histo￾logical findings. They also reported significantly higher
oxygen extraction in the HBOC-201–perfused
group.(10) The results of these studies are in line with
the results of our study and indicate that machine per￾fusion with HBOC-201 is equal or even superior for
the function and quality of liver grafts.
Limitations of this study are relatively small sample
sizes in the HBOC-201 study groups, lack of trans￾plant validation, and perfusions in the 3 study groups
were performed consecutively rather than after ran￾domization. We do not, however, believe that a poten￾tial learning curve could have played a role in the
current study as our research team had extensively opti￾mized its NMP technique prior to the perfusion of any
of the included liver grafts, after which no changes in
perfusion technique were made.
In conclusion, NMP can be performed without the
use of RBCs and FFPs by replacing them with HBOC￾201 and gelofusine, respectively. This reduces the costs
and logistical complexity of NMP and avoids the use of
scarce human blood products, which carry the potential
to transmit blood-borne infections. The current study
indicates that perfusing livers with HBOC-201 is at
least similar to perfusion with human RBC. Some of
the biomarkers of liver function and injury used in this
study even suggest a possible superiority of an HBOC￾based perfusion solution. Altogether, this suggests that
NMP with HBOC-201 and gelofusine is a favorable
method and opens a perspective for further optimization
of machine perfusion techniques. Future studies are
needed to assess the safety of performing NMP with
HBOC-201 and gelofusine in a clinical transplantation
setting. For this reason, a clinical trial has recently been
