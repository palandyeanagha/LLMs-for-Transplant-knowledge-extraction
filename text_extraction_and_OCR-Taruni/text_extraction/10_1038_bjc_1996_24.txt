Abstract
The prevalence of primary liver cancer (PLC) varies throughout the
world. It has been attributed to variations in incidence of the
predominant histological type, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
The incidence of PLC types other than HCC such as
cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC) is far less known, especially in
low-incidence areas. The aetiology of HCC and other PLC types is
obscure, with the exception of the association between HCC and
cirrhosis as well as chronic viral hepatitis. The present retrospective
incidence and aetiology study concerns a well-defined population
from a period with a high autopsy frequency. Preserved biopsy
specimens were re-evaluated histopathologically and patient
records were studied. Among 590 histologically verified cases of
PLC, HCC constituted 90%, CCC 8% and a mixed form of these
types 1%. At the end of the study period the annual age-
standardised incidence rate of HCC was 3.6 cases per 100,000


inhabitants. Other PLC types were hepatoblastoma (n = 3),
fibrolamellar carcinoma (n = 2), angiosarcoma (n = 1) and
infantile haemangioendothelioma (n = 1), each constituting less
than 1% of the PLC cases. Comparing HCC with CCC we found that
cirrhosis (70%) and alcoholism (21%) was significantly more
frequent in HCC, and cholelithiasis was significantly more common
(60%) in patients with CCC. In the majority of the PLC cases with
liver cirrhosis this disorder was unknown before diagnosis of the
tumour.
