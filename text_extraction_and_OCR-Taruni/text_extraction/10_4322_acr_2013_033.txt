ABSTRACT
Inflammation of the inner layer of the heart, especially the valvular endothelium, 
chordae tendinae and mural endocardium was first recognized almost 350 
years ago. Over the years it has had many names, but is now generally 
designated infective endocarditis (IE) and has an associated infectious agent. 
A sterile vegetative process can also affect the valves and is usually referred 
to as Libman-Sacks endocarditis. The developments of medical science that 
allowed for our understanding of this entity included refinement of the autopsy, 
medical microscopy, microbiology, and in recent years, molecular studies. 
Some observations were misleading but clarification particularly followed the 
reports of Morgagni, Osler and Libman. As understanding of the pathobiology 
of infective endocarditis grew so did the effectiveness of therapy. This paper 
provides a detailed history of the development of the concept of Infective 
endocarditis citing many key morphological observations and concludes with 
brief comments about current concepts of pathogenesis as well as a few 
remarks about therapy.
Keywords: Endocarditis/diagnosis; Endocarditis/history.
Endocarditis is the inflammation of the 
inner layer of the heart, usually involving the heart 
valves, both native and prosthetic. Other cardiac 
structures including the chordae tendinae, the 
mural endocardium, the sinuses of Valsalva and the 
interventricular septum can also be involved. The 
typical lesion of endocarditis is the vegetation, which 
in its earliest stages, consists of fibrin and platelets 
with no or few inflammatory cells. This beginning 
vegetation, characteristic of coagulopathic states, 
is known as non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis 
or endocardiosis (NBTE). These uncomplicated 
histopathologic features are also typical of the 
vegetations of acute rheumatic fever1
 and systemic 
lupus erythematosus, also known as Libman-Sacks 
endocarditis.2
When infectious agents and inflammatory 
cells supervene the term “infective” or “infectious” 
endocarditis is applied. Bacteria are most often the 
cause, but fungi can also be seen, particularly in 
immunodeficient (e.g., AIDS) or immunosuppressed 
(e.g., post-chemotherapy or post-transplantation) 
patients. For many years the terms “acute bacterial 
endocarditis” (ABE) and “subacute bacterial 
endocarditis” (SBE) were applied but, with the 
increasing recognition of a variety of causative 
organisms and their variable clinical presentations, 
the term “infective endocarditis” has come to be the 
standard. Staphylococci or streptococci were often 
identified in the “acute” cases, typically affecting a 
chronically damaged (e.g., calcific aortic stenosis) or 
congenitally deformed (e.g., bicuspid aortic) valve.

work of Giovanni Battista Morgagni (1682-1771) 
(Figure 1) set the firm foundation for the practice 
of medicine by establishing clinical and pathologic 
correlations as the basis for the understanding of 
disease.12 In Section II of De sedibus … Morgagni 
described chronic rheumatic valvulitis with aortic 
valve endocarditis, correlated in great detail with 
the clinical course of the patient with the findings 
at autopsy. Both Giovanni Maria Lancisi (1654-
1720) and Raymond de Vieussens (1641-1715) 
described lesions likely representing aortic valve 
infective endocarditis prior to Morgagni7
, but neither 
the descriptive details nor the clinical correlations 
are as clear.
Jean-Nicolas Corvisart (1755-1821) 
provided the first description of mitral valve 
endocarditis and introduced the term “vegetation,” 
alluding to soft valvular excrescences easily 
detached from the valves.13 The lesions reminded 
Corvisart of syphilitic warts and he incorrectly 
concluded that the cardiac lesions were another 
manifestation of that disease, even suggesting 
that anti-venereal treatment might be useful if 
the diagnosis could be established.7
 Corvisart 
was physician to Napoleon. Every case dying on 
These forms of endocarditis were often destructive 
and many of the earliest descriptions of endocarditis 
highlighted the ulcero-necrotic behavior of the 
infection.
Streptococcus viridans was recognized 
as the prototypic organism of subacute bacterial 
endocarditis3
 which, characteristically, affected 
damaged and fibrotic valves of chronic rheumatic 
fever and which, also characteristically, usually took 
four to six months from diagnosis to death. The final 
illness of Gustav Mahler (1860-1911), the great 
conductor and composer, exemplifies this illness.4,5
Mahler had well-documented childhood rheumatic 
fever. His endocarditis developed while he was 
conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. 
Emanuel Libman (1872-1946), the brilliant physician 
who had studied with Theodor Escherich (1857-
1911) and was himself an expert microbiologist, 
as well as a superb pianist, advised Mahler of his 
prognosis, allowing Mahler time to return to his 
beloved Vienna where he died approximately six 
months after consulting with Libman.
Although endocarditis almost certainly 
occurred throughout the ages, there is no 
documentation of cardiac valvular/endothelial 
inflammation until Lazare Rivière (1589-1655) 
described,6-8 in 1646 (Table 1), a patient presenting 
with palpitations and irregular pulse who died 
after a relatively short course. At autopsy, “round 
carbuncles” were found in the left ventricle, 
resembling a “cluster of hazelnuts” and filling up the 
“opening of the aorta.” His description also suggested 
that the aortic valve was “hardened”.8
 Although not 
unequivocally evocative of endocarditis, Laennec 
credited this report as the first account of aortic 
valve disease with vegetations of endocarditis.9
Rivière, who introduced the teaching of chemistry at 
Montpellier, was an advocate of the medicinal uses 
of antimony.10

describe “wart-like excrescences” occurring in an 
18-year-old patient who also had abscess formation 
at the aortic root. This report was also the first to 
document peripheral embolization, later described 
in greater detail almost a century later by Löhlein 
and Baehr.16,17
A towering figure in the history of medicine, 
René-Theophile Hyacinthe Laennec (1781-1826) 
provided physicians with the first and, for the next 
two centuries, the most important aid to studying 
Corvisart’s wards was autopsied14 and his book, 
Essai sur les maladies et les lésions organiques du 
coeur et des gros vaisseaux, is one of the classic 
texts of cardiac literature.10
Although best known for his studies of 
aneurysms, excellent illustrations of fungating 
as well as ulcerating/perforating aortic valve 
endocarditis were provided by Joseph Hodgson
(1788-1869) in his 1815 book On the Diseases of 
Arteries and Veins.15 He used the term “fungus” to

of Rudolf Virchow. Winge suggested that “parasitic 
particles” could penetrate the skin to enter the 
circulatory system and be disseminated to the 
cardiac valves, although the basis of his conclusion 
is not clear.7,21 The experimental injection of material 
from vegetation did not cause the death of a rabbit.7
Sir Samuel Wilks (1824-1911), the great 
physician at Guy’s Hospital, London, cited the work 
of Kirkes but concentrated his attention on the effects 
of embolic vegetations when they involved the small 
vessels of organs.22 He postulated that the systemic 
effects of “arterial pyemia” were usually the cause 
of death in patients with infective endocarditis, 
rather than the valvular vegetations themselves 
and emphasized that infective endocarditis should 
always be considered as a possible diagnosis in 
patients with fevers of unknown origin. He also 
suggested scarlet fever as the cause of the local 
valvular lesions.7
Three years after Winge a countryman, 
Hjalmar Heiberg (1837-1897) described a 22-year￾old postpartum woman who became critically ill ten 
days after delivery and died a few weeks later. He 
described chains of cocci within the vegetation23,24 
although his original interpretation of them was 
incorrect.
Theodor Albrecht Edwin Klebs (1824-
1913), also a student of Virchow, was a pioneering 
microbiologist who determined the etiology of 
diphtheria (Corynebacterium diphtheriae) and for 
whom the genus Klebsiella was named. In 1878 
he proposed that all cases of endocarditis were 
due to an infectious organism.25 Other students 
of microbial organisms, including Louis Pasteur 
(1822-1895) and Robert Koch (1843-1910), helped 
develop microbiology as a distinct and increasingly 
sophisticated specialty and, although only 
peripherally involved with the study of endocarditis, 
certainly contributed to its understanding. Pasteur 
advocated newer approaches to obtaining blood 
cultures, including obtaining samples from various 
sites, evidence of his understanding of the vascular 
dissemination of infectious agents.
Although the 1884 monograph by Sir Byrom 
Bramwell (1847-1931)26 provided little in the way 
of new information, it does offer a comprehensive, 
highly readable review of the information available 
at the time of its writing. There are outstanding 
and highly accurate illustrations of the macro￾and microscopic features of the various forms of 
endocarditis, which he described in considerable 
cardiac disease when he invented the stethoscope.9
In addition to many detailed studies of diseases of the 
heart valves he reported on a number of patients with 
infective endocarditis. Laennec noted that several 
of his endocarditis patients had no history of syphilis 
and he doubted that association proposed by his 
teacher Corvisart. Laennec described two forms of 
vegetations (verrucal and globular), suggesting that 
the globular form represented thrombus formation, 
a hypothesis eventually confirmed by others.7,8
Renowned as “the last of the great blood￾letters,” Jean Baptiste Bouillaud (1796-1881) 
was, nonetheless, a fine physician who recognized 
the connection between rheumatic fever and 
heart disease and also recognized the value of 
digitalis as the “opium of the heart”.10,18 In his 1824 
monograph, Traité cliniques des maladies du coeur 
et des gros vaisseaux, written with René-Joseph￾Hyacinthe Bertin (1757-1828)10,19, and a year later 
in his own book, Traité Clinique des maladies du 
Coeur, he introduced the terms “endocardium” and 
“endocarditis.” He described the various stages 
of endocarditis, from acute, early inflammatory 
changes with edema as well as suppurative cases to 
a second period of organization of the inflammatory 
process and, in the patients who survived, fibrotic 
valvular change with ultimate calcification and 
ossification, noting the regurgitation was associated 
with valvular retraction. His acute lesions correlate 
with both acute rheumatic valvulitis and, in 
those examples of suppuration, acute infective 
endocarditis.
William Senhouse Kirkes (1823-1864) 
described a number of cases of infective endocarditis 
with peripheral embolization, emphasizing both 
systemic signs and symptoms.20 He greatly 
expanded the understanding of the embolic potential 
of vegetations of both the left and right heart valves. 
He particularly emphasized the effects of relatively 
large systemic emboli. William Osler would later 
acknowledge a debt to Kirkes for his lucid studies. 
Others, who studied infectious endocarditis, both 
before and after Kirkes, included Jean-Martin 
Charcot (1825-1893), Alfred Vulpian (1826-1887), 
Rudolf Virchow (1821-1902), Karl von Rokitansky 
(1804-1878) and others.7,8 It may be that both 
Virchow and Rokitansky recognized, but incorrectly 
interpreted, bacteria as “small granulations” in the 
vegetations they studied.7
The earliest suggestion that microbials were 
the cause of an endocarditis came from Emanuel 
Fredrik Hagbarth Winge (1827-1894), a student

to the Gram stain as the best way to identify 
bacterial cocci, which, in his estimation, were 
always present. A prolific writer, Osler’s clinical and 
morphologic descriptions are as valid today as they 
were then and remain valuable reading. Among 
other phenomena he clarified and clearly described 
are the characteristic painful red cutaneous nodules 
of bacterial endocarditis (“Osler’s nodes”), which 
were first described by Kirkes.20 Osler was the first 
to mention the association of platelets and fibrin in 
the vegetations postulating that they were derived 
from the blood stream and were not a product of the 
valve lesions.28
Hugo Schottmuller (1867-1936) was the 
first to isolate Streptococcus viridans from cases of 
what was then called chronic or subacute bacterial 
endocarditis, showing that “ordinary” streptococci 
produced hemolysis on blood agar plates, whereas 
the “little bacteria” from endocarditis patients did 
not.31 Others, including Libman, soon confirmed his 
1910 report.
1910 was also the year of publication of 
Max Löhlein’s report of the hemorrhagic kidney 
lesions associated with infective endocarditis.16
Although embolic lesions were well known at this 
time, Löhlein provided a clear description of the 
histopathology of what came to be called “Löhlein 
embolic glomerulonephritis”, while also highlighting 
the renal manifestations of this complication.
Emanuel Libman (1872-1946) (Figure 3) 
was a brilliant physician and was referred to as “the 
Jewish Osler.” He made invaluable contributions to 
the knowledge of infective endocarditis and helped 
refine understanding of the subacute forms of the 
disease.3,32 As Osler, he was a skilled pathologist as 
well as a particularly astute diagnostician. His 1909 
paper, with Herbert Celler, described 43 patients, 
including 19 who were autopsied.32 Libman had 
studied with Theodor Escherich (1857-1911) and was 
a skilled and highly knowledgeable microbiologist. 
Importantly, blood cultures were obtained from 
36 patients, 35 of whom had an “atypical,” non￾hemolytic streptococcus. The paper also reviewed 
the 2,750 blood cultures made over a ten year 
period noting that the organism found in subacute 
bacterial endocarditis, which Libman determined to 
be identical to the Streptococcus viridans identified 
by Schottmuller two years previously31, was not 
found in any other form of endocarditis and that 
blood culture established the diagnosis. In another 
paper that year he showed that, despite the fact 
that bacteria may not be detectable and that healing 
detail. By the time of publication of Bramwell’s book, 
Gram staining for bacteria had become available 
and he noted their presence in both the vegetations 
and in the embolized material. Bramwell was one 
of the first to emphasize that left-sided valves were 
more often involved than right. He also highlighted 
the various ways, in which infective endocarditis 
presents, nothing that death was inevitable.
One of the greatest physicians of all time, 
and one of the four principal founding physicians 
of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Sir 
William Osler (1849-1919) (Figure 2) was a brilliant 
diagnostician, pathologist, writer and lecturer. He 
expanded greatly the understanding of the clinical 
manifestations and the pathology of infectious 
endocarditis.27 His Gulstonian lectures, emphasizing 
clinical-pathologic correlations, were based on his 
personal experience with more than 200 patients.28
He recommended simplification of the relatively 
complex classifications previously used, advocating 
that endocarditis be clinically distinguished as simple, 
with few or slight symptoms, and malignant, in which 
there were prominent, often destructive valvular 
lesions, and severe constitutional disturbances.27-30
He also emphasized that “sclerotic or malformed” 
valves were more prone to endocarditis. He pointed

George Baehr (1887-1978), Libman’s 
student and then colleague at The Mount Sinai 
Hospital, New York, expanded on the contributions 
of Kirkes, Osler, Löhlein and others with 
comprehensive descriptions of the renal pathology 
in patients with subacute bacterial endocarditis.17 His 
1912 report of morphologic studies of 34 patients, 
in 25 of whom Streptococcus viridans had been 
cultured, outlined the progression of the glomerular 
lesions from epithelial swelling to eventual necrosis 
and inflammatory cell infiltration. It was the young 
George Baehr, then a house officer, who was 
dispatched by Libman to Gustav Mahler’s hospital 
bed to obtain the blood culture sample from which 
Streptococcus viridans was isolated.4,7 In another 
version of the story, Baehr took the Fifth Avenue 
trolley carrying the necessary paraphernalia the two 
miles from Mount Sinai to New York’s Plaza Hotel to 
obtain the specimen.
Two decades later sulfur drugs would prove 
effective in treating at least a few patients with this 
dread disease33 to be followed, in another decade, 
by the highly effective penicillin34 and succeeding 
antibiotics.
Infective endocarditis remains a potentially 
fatal disorder and establishing the diagnosis can 
be elusive.35-39 Newer organisms, requiring newer 
treatments, have been recognized. Controversies 
about therapy, including medical and surgical 
approaches, persist.36,40,41 Even the importance 
of pathology studies of infective endocarditis has 
come into question42 at the same time that the value 
of autopsy has been reaffirmed.43 In the last four 
hundred years this disorder has prompted some of 
the great writings in medical literature.

can occur in a subgroup of patients with subacute 
bacterial endocarditis, the prognosis remained 
grim with patients dying from complications such 
as embolization to various organs as well as from 
glomerulonephritis.
Although subacute endocarditis is sometimes 
referred to as “Osler disease” it was Libman who 
proposed the term. In 1924 Libman, along with 
Benjamin Sacks (1896-1971), described a previously 
unrecognized form a vegetative endocarditis from 
which organisms could not be isolated occurring in 
patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).2
This byproduct of a coagulopathy, later shown to 
be part of the antiphospholipid syndrome, is the 
same as the endocardial fibrin-platelet vegetation 
associated with various other coagulopathies and, 
in the non-SLE patient, is known as nonbacterial 
thrombotic endocarditis or endocardiosis (NBTE). 
It was noted that the vegetations could localize 
on either the atrial or the ventricular surfaces of 
the valve with extensions from the leaflet to the 
ventricular endocardium. The Libman-Sachs lesions 
was distinguished from the endocarditis of acute 
rheumatic fever, which it histologically resembles, 
by the absence of clinical evidence for rheumatic 
fever and, especially, by the absence of Aschoff 
bodies in the myocardium.2
