Abstract
Bacterial infection is a frequent trigger of acute-on￾chronic liver failure (ACLF), syndrome that could also 
increase the risk of infection. This investigation evaluated 
prevalence and characteristics of bacterial and fungal 
infections causing and complicating ACL F, predictors of 
follow-up bacterial infections and impact of bacterial 
infections on survival.
Patients 407 patients with ACL F and 235 patients with 
acute decompensation (AD).
Results 152 patients (37%) presented bacterial 
infections at ACL F diagnosis; 46%(n=117) of the 
remaining 255 patients with ACL F developed bacterial 
infections during follow-up (4 weeks). The corresponding 
figures in patients with AD were 25% and 18% 
(p<0.001). Severe infections (spontaneous bacterial 
peritonitis, pneumonia, severe sepsis/shock, nosocomial 
infections and infections caused by multiresistant 
organisms) were more prevalent in patients with ACL F. 
Patients with ACL F and bacterial infections (either at 
diagnosis or during follow-up) showed higher grade of 
systemic inflammation at diagnosis of the syndrome, 
worse clinical course (ACLF 2-3 at final assessment: 
47% vs 26%; p<0.001) and lower 90-day probability 
of survival (49% vs 72.5%;p<0.001) than patients 
with ACL F without infection. Bacterial infections were 
independently associated with mortality in patients with 
ACL F-1 and ACL F-2. Fungal infections developed in 9 
patients with ACL F (2%) and in none with AD, occurred 
mainly after ACL F diagnosis (78%) and had high 90-day 
mortality (71%).
Conclusion Bacterial infections are extremely
frequent in ACL F. They are severe and associated with
intense systemic inflammation, poor clinical course 
and high mortality. Patients with ACL F are highly 
predisposed to develop bacterial infections within 
a short follow-up period and could benefit from 
prophylactic strategies.
Introduction
Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) in cirrhosis 
is a syndrome characterised by acute decompen￾sation (AD), organ failure(s) and high short-term 
mortality.1
 Bacterial infection is the most frequent 
trigger of ACLF in Western countries.1–3
Patients with decompensated cirrhosis present 
chronic systemic inflammation due to intestinal 
dysbiosis, loss of integrity of the intestinal mucosal 
barrier and sustained translocation of pathogen-as￾sociated molecular patterns (PAMPs).4–7 In patients 
Significance of this study on this subject
What is already known?
► Bacterial infections are a frequent precipitating 
event of acute-on-chronic fiver failure (ACLF). 
Type and severity of infections have been 
partially described. Other characteristics of 
bacterial infections, risk of bacterial and fungal 
infections after ACLF diagnosis, microbiology 
and relationship with clinical course are 
unknown.
What are the new findings?
► Patients with ACLF are highly predisposed to 
develop bacterial infections within a short 
follow-up period.
► Severe infections (spontaneous bacterial 
peritonitis, pneumonia, severe sepsis/shock, 
nosocomial infections and infections caused by 
multiresistant organisms) are more prevalent in 
patients with ACLF.
► Bacteria infections, either at diagnosis or during 
follow-up, are key prognostic determinants in 
patients with ACLF. They are associated with 
more severe systemic inflammation, poorer 
clinical course and higher mortality.
► Bacterial infections are independent predictors 
of 90-day mortality in patients with ACLF-1 and 
ACLF-2.
► Inappropriate empirical antibiotic strategies 
increase 90-day mortality in ACLF triggered or 
complicated by infection.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the 
foreseeable future?
► Infection control practices are essential in the 
management of patients with ACLF.
► Patients with ACLF may benefit from 
prophylactic strategies aimed to decrease their 
prohibitive risk of infection.

Hepatology
with bacterial infections, ACLF is due to massive release of 
PAMPs by the infecting bacteria. PAMPs activate innate immune 
system leading to the release of inflammatory cytokines, vasodi￾latory mediators and reactive oxygen species.4 7–9 Other precipi￾tating events (ie, acute alcoholic hepatitis; hepatitis B virus flare) 
cause systemic inflammation by the release of damaged-associ￾ated molecular patterns by the liver.10 Multiorgan dysfunction/
failure in ACLF develops as consequence of acute impairment in 
systemic circulatory function and organ hypoperfusion and also 
to direct deleterious effects of inflammatory mediators in organ 
homeostasis, a feature known as immune pathology.3 4 7 11
It has been suggested that in addition to being a trigger of ACLF, 
bacterial infections may also be a specific complication of the 
syndrome. The hypothesis is that, as it occurs in sepsis,1
 the exag￾gerated systemic inflammatory response associated with ACLF may 
be followed by a state of immune paralysis that predisposes to early 
development of secondary infections and contributes to increase 
mortality.12–16 This hypothesis is supported by a single study 
showing a higher prevalence of bacterial infections during hospi￾talisation in patients with ACLF (defined according to outdated 
criteria) in comparison to AD.17 Other two studies suggest that 
nosocomial infections are independent predictors of ACLF.18 19
Type and severity of infections were partially described in these 
studies with no mention on other characteristics of bacterial infec￾tions, microbiology and relationship with clinical course.
The current study was performed to assess the prevalence of 
bacterial infections triggering and complicating ACLF, the charac￾teristics of these infections and their impact on the clinical course 
and prognosis using information from the Canonic database.1
 Data 
on fungal infection and colonisation were also analysed.
Pati ents and methods
Study population and aims of the study
In the current investigation, only patients with complete 4-week 
follow-up data after diagnosis of AD or ACLF were included. 
We excluded 701 patients, 636 with AD without scheduled visits 
after diagnosis as per protocol and 65 with ACLF with insufficient 
data at diagnosis (figure 1). Therefore, 642 patients were finally 
included, 407 with ACLF (292 diagnosed at enrolment and 115 
during hospitalisation) and 235 with AD without ACLF. Follow-up 
visits were performed at days 1, 2, 7, 14, 21 and 28 after diagnosis 
of ACLF or AD. Patients with AD developing ACLF during hospi￾talisation completed the 28-day follow-up period after ACLF diag￾nosis. Data on the development of bacterial or fungal infections, 
including type and site of acquisition, clinical characteristics and 
microbiology, were recorded at diagnosis and at each visit.
Definitions related to infection
Diagnostic criteria of bacterial infections were the following. Spon￾taneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): polymorphonuclear (PMN) cell 
count in ascitic fluid ≥250/mm3
. Urinary tract infection (UTI): 
abnormal urinary sediment (>10leukocytes/field) and positive 
urinary culture or uncountable leukocytes per field if negative 
cultures. Spontaneous bacteraemia: positive blood cultures and no 
cause of bacteraemia. Secondary bacteraemia: (1) catheter-related 
Figure 1 Flow chart of the patients included and excluded from the study. In total, 642 patients were included. Three hundred and sixty patients 
developed infections throughout the study: 152 with ACLF and 59 with AD presented an infection at diagnosis, 149 patients without infections at 
diagnosis developed infections during follow-up (117 with ACLF and 32 with AD). Finally, 53 patients with bacterial infections at diagnosis or during 
follow-up developed new bacterial infections. ACLF, acute-on-chronic liver failure; AD, acute decompensation.

infection (positive blood and catheter cultures); (2) bacteraemia 
occurring within 24hours after an invasive procedure. Pneumonia:
clinical signs of infection and new infiltrates on chest X-ray. Bron￾chitis: clinical features of infection, no radiographic infiltrates and 
positive sputum culture. Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI): clin￾ical signs of infection associated with swelling, erythema, heat and 
tenderness in the skin. Cholangitis: cholestasis, right upper quad￾rant pain and/or jaundice and radiological data of biliary obstruc￾tion. Spontaneous bacterial empyema: PMN count in pleural 
fluid ≥250/mm³. Secondary peritonitis: PMN count in ascitic 
fluid ≥250/mm³ and evidence (abdominal CT/ surgery) of an 
intra-abdominal source of infection. Clostridium difficile infection 
(CDI): positive stool toxin in a patient with diarrhoea. Unproven 
bacterial infection: presence of fever and leucocytosis requiring 
antibiotic therapy without any identifiable source.20
Fungal infections were defined as follows. Invasive candidiasis: 
isolation of Candida spp in one or more blood cultures (candi￾daemia) or from normally sterile body fluids. Candida colonisa￾tion: isolation of Candida spp in non-sterile fluid in the absence of 
infection. Probable invasive aspergillosis: detection of Aspergillus
by direct examination and/or culture of respiratory samples in the 
presence of radiological imaging compatible with lung infection.21
Criteria used to define the site of acquisition of infection, 
infection resolution and appropriateness of empirical antibiotic 
strategies are described in online supplementary material.
Bacterial infections were considered as potential triggers of 
ACLF when they were detected prior or at the time of diagnosis 
of the syndrome (day 0). Infections were qualified as compli￾cations of ACLF when they were detected between day 1 and 
day 28 after the diagnosis of the syndrome. These criteria were 
based in the foreseeable sequence of events of ACLF triggered 
by bacterial infections. First, infections causing ACLF precede 
the onset of the syndrome and ACLF development frequently 
precedes hospital admission. Second, in the canonic study there 
was an additional 1day delay between hospital admission, study 
enrolment and ACLF diagnosis in all patients as per protocol 
design and a delay of two or more additional days in 40% 
of patients for other reasons.1
 Finally, the canonic protocol 
included a complete diagnostic work-up of bacterial infections at 
study enrolment. The same criteria were used to qualify bacterial 
infections in patients with AD without ACLF.
Online supplementary table 1 shows the bacteria and fungi 
isolated in patients with and without ACLF. Criteria used to 
define multidrug-resistant organism (MDROs) have been previ￾ously described.20
Definitions related to ACLF
Diagnostic criteria of organ failure was based on the chronic 
liver failure consortium (CLIF-C OFs) organ failure score.1 2
ACLF grade 1 (ACLF-1) defines the presence of renal failure 
alone or of any other single organ failure if associated to renal 
dysfunction and/or cerebral dysfunction. ACLF grade 2 and 
grade 3 (ACLF-2 and ACLF-3) define the presence of 2 and 3 to 
6 organ failures, respectively.1 2 The clinical course of ACLF was 
defined as good–relatively good when the ACLF grade at final 
assessment was 0 or 1 and severe when it was 2 or 3.22
Assessment of systemic inflammation and of oxidative stress 
at diagnosis of ACLF and AD
Systemic inflammation was assessed by measuring the plasma 
levels of five inflammatory cytokines involved in innate immune 
responses8
 and systemic oxidative stress by the determination of 
the redox state of human serum albumin.
Cytokines were measured using a multiplexed bead-based 
immunoassay on a Luminex 100 Bioanalyzer. Non-oxidised 
(human mercaptalbumin, HMA), and reversible and irrevers￾ible oxidised (normercaptalbumins HNA1 and HNA2) albumin 
forms in plasma were separated by high-performance liquid 
chromatography and detected by fluorescence. Normal values in 
healthy subjects have been previously described.8
Statistical analysis
Results are presented as frequencies and percentages for categor￾ical variables, means and SDs for normally distributed contin￾uous variables and median and IQR for not normally distributed 
continuous variables. In univariate analyses, χ2
 test was used 
for categorical variables, Student’s t-test or analysis of variance 
for normal continuous variables and Mann-Whitney or Kruskal 
Wallis test for not normally distributed continuous variables. To 
identify predictors of infection in patients with ACLF, logistic 
regression models were carried out. Factors showing a clini￾cally and statistically significant association to the outcome in 
univariate analyses were selected for the initial model. The final 
models were fitted by using a stepwise forward method based 
on likelihood ratios with the same significance level (p<0.05) 
for entering and dropping variables. The proportional hazards 
model for competing risks proposed by Fine and Gray23 was 
used to identify independent predictors of mortality. This model 
was chosen to account for liver transplantation as an event 
‘competing’ with mortality. In all statistical analyses, significance 
was set at p<0.05. Analyses were done with SPSS V. 23.0 and 
SAS V.9.4 statistical packages.
Results
Overall bacterial infections
Figure 1 shows the flow chart of patients included (n=642) 
and excluded (n=701) from the study. A total of 360 patients 
(56%) presented bacterial infections during the study. In 211 
patients (152 patients with ACLF and 59 with AD) infection was 
present at diagnosis. In the remaining 149 patients, infection 
was diagnosed during follow-up. Thirty-one patients with bacte￾rial infections at diagnosis developed new bacterial infections 
during follow-up. Twenty-two patients with ACLF complicated 
by infection developed reinfection (reinfections are not included 
in the analysis of the results).
Bacterial infections triggering ACLF
Prevalence and characteristics
Two hundred and eleven patients (33%) presented bacterial infec￾tions at diagnosis of ACLF or AD. Prevalence was significantly 
higher in patients with ACLF (overall infections: 37% vs 25%; 
proved infections: 33.5% vs 19%; p<0.001each). All types of 
infection except for SSTI, CDI and Unproven infections were 
more frequent in patients with ACLF. Differences were significant 
for pneumonia (7.7% vs 3%, p=0.015) and secondary peritonitis 
(2.6% vs 0%, p=0.009) (table 1). The prevalence of infections at 
ACLF diagnosis was significantly higher (p=0.016) in patients 
with ACLF-3 (52%; see online supplementary table 2).
Progression to severe sepsis/septic shock was more frequently 
observed in infections present at diagnosis of ACLF than in 
those associated with AD (49% vs 2%; p<0.001). Prevalence 
of nosocomial infections (53% vs 22%; p<0.001) and of infec￾tions caused by MDROs (16% vs 3%: p=0.01) was also signifi￾cantly higher in ACLF (table 1). Significant differences were also 
observed when the analysis was restricted to patients with ACLF 
diagnosed at enrolment (data not shown).

Hepatology
Impact of infection on the severity of ACLF, clinical course and 
mortality
The grade of systemic inflammation (white blood cell (WBC) 
count, serum C reactive protein (CRP) levels and plasma 
concentration of inflammatory cytokines) was more intense 
in patients with infections at ACLF diagnosis than in those 
without (table 2). Severity of the syndrome was also higher 
in patients with ACLF precipitated by bacterial infections, as 
indicated by a higher prevalence of encephalopathy, circu￾latory, respiratory and cerebral failure at diagnosis of the 
syndrome, a higher baseline CLIF-C ACLF score and higher 
requirements of organ support during hospitalisation (table 2). 
Similar results were observed when patients with Unproven 
infections were considered as non-infected (see online supple￾mentary table 3).
The clinical course of ACLF, as estimated by the final ACLF 
grade, was also significantly worse in patients with ACLF 
caused by bacterial infections. Twenty-eight day and 90-day
mortality rates were also higher in patients with ACLF trig￾gered by bacterial infection (overall or proved episodes), 
differences being statistically significant only at 90 days 
(table 2, see online supplementary table 3).
To confirm that infection-triggered ACLF portends a worse 
prognosis, we examined data on the 115 patients with AD who 
developed ACLF during follow-up. Cases triggered by infec￾tion showed higher organ support requirements, worse clinical 
course of ACLF and higher 28 and 90-day mortality rates than 
those caused by other precipitating events (see online supple￾mentary table 4).
Infection resolution and patient mortality according to the type and 
characteristics of bacterial infections detected at ACLF diagnosis
The resolution rate of bacterial infections detected at diag￾nosis was significantly lower in patients with ACLF than in 
those with AD (71.1% vs 98.3%; p<0.001). Type of infection

influenced infection resolution and mortality (table 3). SSTI 
and Unproven infections showed the lowest resolution rates 
and SSTI and SBP the highest mortality rates. The presence 
of severe sepsis/septic shock and the isolation of MDROs also 
influenced negatively infection resolution and prognosis.
Bacterial infections complicating ACLF not triggered by 
infection
Incidence and characteristics
Patients with ACLF not triggered by infections presented signifi￾cantly higher incidence of bacterial infection during follow-up 
than patients with AD (46% vs 18%, p<0.001) (table 1). This 
feature was observed throughout the entire 28-day follow-up 
period (figure 2A). The risk of developing bacterial infections 
correlated directly with the grade of ACLF (figure 2B and online 
supplementary table 2). Similar results were observed when 
patients with Unproven infections were considered as non-in￾fected (see online supplementary figure 1A and B).
All types of bacterial infections were more frequent in patients 
with ACLF than in patients with AD except for CDI (table 1). 
Differences were statistically significant for pneumonia (8.6% vs 
1.7%, p<0.001), SBP (8.6% vs 3.4%, p=0.03) and bacteraemia 
(3.9% vs 0.6%, p=0.03). Follow-up infections were also more 
severe in patients with ACLF as indicated by the higher prevalence 
of sepsis and severe sepsis/septic shock (41.9% vs 6.2%, p<0.001) 
and of infections caused by MDROs (18.8% vs 3.1%, p=0.02) 
(table 1).
Risk factors of follow-up bacterial infections in ACLF and impact of 
infection on clinical course and mortality
Patients with ACLF developing bacterial infections during 
follow-up were those with higher grade of systemic inflamma￾tion and higher severity of ACLF at diagnosis as indicated by 
higher WBC count and higher plasma levels of CRP and cyto￾kines, higher frequency of hepatic encephalopathy, cerebral 
and respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation and higher 
CLIF-C ACLF score. They also presented worse clinical course 
and higher 28-day and 90-day mortality rates (table 2).
Online supplementary figure 2 shows the individual plasma 
concentrations of cytokines measured at diagnosis of the 
syndrome in patients with ACLF triggered by infection, ACLF 
complicated by infection and ACLF without infections during 
the whole study period. Although concentrations were higher in 
infected patients a marked overlap among groups was observed.
Multiple regression analysis identified CLIF-C ACLF score 
(n=167; OR=1.10, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.08; p=0.017) and HNA2 
(n=68; OR=1.15, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.27; p<0.005) at diagnosis 
as independent risk factors of follow-up bacterial infections.
The resolution rate of follow-up bacterial infections in patients 
with ACLF was 78.6% versus 98.8% in AD (table 3, p<0.001). 
Resolution rate and mortality rates associated with bacterial 
infections at follow-up were not significantly influenced by the 
type and severity of the infections.
Rate and characteristics of bacterial infections occurring in 
ACLF according to the precipitating event and the need for 
critical care
Rate and characteristics of bacterial infections that triggered or 
complicated ACLF differed between patients hospitalised in the 
intensive care unit (ICU) and those admitted to the regular ward. 
In contrast, type of precipitating event did not influence these 
parameters (see online supplementary tables 5 and 6). Preva￾lence of infection was significantly higher in patients with ACLF 
triggered by infection requiring ICU admission. Pneumonia was 
more prevalent in critical care while UTI and SSTI were more 
frequent in the regular ward. As expected, severity of infection 
was higher in the ICU.
Overall impact of bacterial infections on clinical course and 
survival in patients with ACLF
The clinical course (ACLF 2–3 at final assessment: 47% vs 
26%; p<0.001) was significantly worse and the probability of 
90-day transplant-free survival significantly shorter (figure 3A) 
in patients with ACLF and bacterial infection (either at diag￾nosis or during follow-up) than in those without (45% vs 70%, 
p<0.001). Similar results were obtained when only patients 
developing proved infections were considered as infected 
(see online supplementary figure 3). Infections had a great 
impact on the prognosis of patients with the less severe forms 
of ACLF (figure 3B and C). Infected patients with ACLF-1 and 
ACLF-2 showed a lower 90-day probability of survival than 
those without infection. In contrast, patients with ACLF-3 with 
and without infections did not show differences in prognosis. 
Patients with AD with and without bacterial infections (overall, 
figure 3A, and proved, online supplementary figure 3) also 
showed a similar prognosis, since patients with AD developing 
ACLF during hospitalisation were included in the ACLF group.
Appropriateness of empirical antibiotic strategies also had an 
impact on clinical course and survival of patients with ACLF. 
Appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy was administered in 
74% and 72% of bacterial infections triggering and complicating 
ACLF, respectively. Adequacy of initial antibiotic strategies was 
associated with lower critical care requirements, better evolution 
of the syndrome in infection-triggered ACLF and lower 28 and 
90-day mortality (table 4).
Predictors of mortality
Online supplementary table 7 shows factors associated with 
90-day transplant-free mortality in the univariate and multivar￾iate analysis in the whole series of patients with ACLF. Age (HR: 
1.03), hepatic encephalopathy (HR: 1.98), serum bilirubin (HR: 
1.03), INR (HR: 1.38) and serum creatinine (HR: 1.27) at diag￾nosis of the syndrome were identified as independent predic￾tors of death. When the analysis was restricted to patients with 
ACLF-1 and ACLF-2 (table 5, first model), serum bilirubin (HR: 
1.03; 95%CI 1.01 to 1.05; p<0.001), age (HR: 1.03; 95%CI 
1.00 to 1.05; p=0.02), bacterial infection at diagnosis or during 
follow-up (HR: 1.79; 95%CI 1.08 to 2.96; p=0.02) and serum 
creatinine (HR: 1.14; 95%CI 1.01 to 1.29; p=0.04) were 
identified as independent predictors. When appropriateness of 
initial antibiotic therapy was introduced in the model (table 5, 
second model), this factor but not bacterial infection remained 
as independent predictor of survival in patients with ACLF-1 
and ACLF-2 (HR: 0.40; 95%CI 0.26 to 0.63; p<0.001). WBC 
count and mechanical ventilation were not entered in the regres￾sion models because of their potential collinearity with infection.
Fungal infection and colonisation
Fungal isolation was infrequent and mainly observed in patients 
with ACLF (3.9% vs 0.4%, p=0.005). Of the 16 patients with 
ACLF and fungal isolation, seven corresponded to invasive 
candidiasis (five candidemias and two secondary peritonitis), 
one to probable IA and eight to colonisation by candida. The 
single isolation in patients with AD consisted of a urinary coloni￾sation by Candida. Six out of the eight invasive fungal infections 
were diagnosed during follow-up in patients with ACLF. In the

remaining two patients (a secondary peritonitis and an IA), diag￾nosis was performed at ACLF diagnosis. Only 19 patients (six 
of them with candida colonisation) received antifungal prophy￾laxis. Mortality rates associated with invasive fungal infection 
and colonisation were 57% and 44% at 28day and 71% and 
67% at 90day, respectively.
Discussion
The results of our study indicate that bacterial infection is a major 
problem and a key prognostic determinant in ACLF. The overall 
prevalence of infections in patients with ACLF was extremely 
high (66.1%). Two-thirds of patients with ACLF presented infec￾tions at diagnosis or within follow-up. In contrast, the overall 
prevalence of infection in patients with AD was of 38.7%. The 
severity of bacterial infections, as indicated by the frequency of 
SBP, pneumonia, severe sepsis, nosocomial infections and infec￾tions caused by MDROs, was also significantly higher in patients 
with ACLF. Not surprisingly, the clinical course of ACLF, as esti￾mated by the percentage of patients with ACLF grade 2 or 3 at 
final assessment, was significantly worse in patients with bacte￾rial infections than in those without (45% vs 25%).
The prevalence of bacterial infections at ACLF diagnosis in 
our series was 37.3%. These infections are important because 
they promote a burst of systemic inflammation that precipitates 
the development of the syndrome.1 3 7 In the current study, we

compared for the first time the severity of ACLF triggered by 
bacterial infections and by other precipitating events. Our results 
clearly show a greater severity of systemic inflammation and of 
ACLF in patients with infections. The clinical course of ACLF 
was also significantly worse in these patients.
One of the most outstanding findings of our study was the 
extremely high incidence of follow-up bacterial infections (46%) 
observed in the 255 patients without infections at ACLF diag￾nosis. This represents that approximately one every two non-in￾fected patients with ACLF will develop bacterial infections 
within 4 weeks after diagnosis. This figure contrasts sharply 
with the 18% incidence of follow-up infections in non-infected 
patients with AD. Bacterial infections are, therefore, not only a

frequent trigger of ACLF but also an extremely common compli￾cation of the syndrome.
The mechanism of this high risk of follow-up bacterial infec￾tions in patients with ACLF is likely multifactorial. Severity of 
systemic oxidative stress (HNA2 levels) and of ACLF (CLIF-C 
ACLF score) at diagnosis were significantly associated with the 
development of follow-up bacterial infections in the current 
study. Systemic inflammation may increase bacterial translo￾cation either directly24 or indirectly (by increasing circulatory 
dysfunction and homeostatic stimulation of sympathetic nervous 
system). The secondary release of norepinephrine at the intestinal 
mucosa impairs the local immune system function and induces 
qualitative and quantitative changes of the intestinal microbiota 
towards a phenotype associated with bacterial translocation.25
The reduction of the amount of bile acid secretion secondary to 
liver failure is another factor favouring intestinal bacterial over￾growth.26 Finally, the frequent instrumentation of patients with 
cerebral, respiratory or renal failure with intravenous, intra-arte￾rial and urinary catheters and the frequent use of artificial organ 
support devices are other major factors increasing the rate of 
follow-up bacterial infections in these patients.27 28 In fact, the 
more prevalent infections complicating ACLF were spontaneous 
bacteraemia and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, which are 
caused by bacterial translocation and pneumonia and secondary 
bacteraemia, which are commonly observed in patients under￾going invasive therapeutic procedures.
There are many similarities between ACLF and severe sepsis. 
Both conditions develop in the setting of intense systemic inflam￾mation and oxidative stress. In patients with sepsis, systemic 
inflammation is initiated by an acute release of PAMPS by 
bacteria and secondary activation of the innate immune system 
cells.29–32 Approximately 40% of patients with ACLF share this 
pathophysiological mechanism.1 8 33 34 The second similarity is 
that patients with ACLF and with severe sepsis develop organ 
failure(s) and that this correlates closely with prognosis.1 19 32 35
Finally, our study suggests that the third feature shared by 
patients with ACLF and with severe sepsis is that they both are 
highly predisposed to develop bacterial infections shortly after 
diagnosis. There are many evidences supporting a two-phase 
immune response in patients with severe sepsis.36–39 Following a 
short initial period (few days after diagnosis) of severe systemic 
inflammation patients develop a second period of immune-sup￾pression due to impairment of immune cell function and apop￾totic depletion of immune cells.39 During this period, aggravation 
of the primary infection or development of new secondary infec￾tions is common.40
The 117 non-infected patients with ACLF at diagnosis of the 
syndrome represent a unique population to assess if this sequence 
of events also occurs in ACLF, since in this group of patients the 
temporal relationship between systemic inflammation, ACLF 
development and follow-up bacterial infections is not interfered 
by antibiotic therapy. Our results support a two-phase clinical 
course in non-infected patients with ACLF. The first phase, prob￾ably very short, is characterised by acute development of severe 
systemic inflammation and organ/system failure(s). ACLF is diag￾nosed at the end of this phase. The second phase, of longer dura￾tion, is characterised by a remarkable high incidence of bacterial 
infections that mainly develop within the first week after the 
diagnosis of ACLF. Whether immune suppression is involved in 
the pathogenesis of this second phase is currently unknown but 
impaired pathogen-killing activity and reactive oxygen species 
release by macrophages and neutrophils has been reported in 
these patients.41 42 Recent studies have also shown that patients 
with ACLF have increased numbers of immunoregulatory 
monocytes and macrophages that express MER receptor tyro￾sine kinase (MERTK)and elevated plasma levels of prostaglandin 
E2, alterations that suppress the innate immune response to 
microbes and could increase the risk of infection.43 44
The high incidence of bacterial infection after ACLF diagnosis 
justifies the implementation of infection control practices such as 
bundles on prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia and 
catheter-related bacteraemia and hand hygiene.45 Selective intes￾tinal decontamination with non-absorbable antibiotics could 
also prevent nosocomial infections in patients with ACLF but 
could also promote the development of MDROs.46 47 Treatments 
aimed at restoring the patients' immune function could also be 
beneficial in these patients.48 49 Our study also demonstrates that 
adequacy of empirical antibiotic strategies is also a key factor in 
the management of infected patients with ACLF. Inappropriate 
first-line therapies were associated with increased mortality. 
Therefore, broad antibiotic schemes covering all potential patho￾gens should be applied at high doses within the first 48–72hours 
after the diagnosis of infection to improve clinical efficacy and 
minimise the selection of resistant strains.45
We observed significantly higher mortality rate and shorter 
probability of survival in patients with ACLF triggered or compli￾cated by bacterial infections than in patients with ACLF without 
bacterial infections throughout the entire period of observa￾tion, suggesting that bacterial infections has a major impact on 
the prognosis of patients with ACLF. This is also supported by 
the observation that infection was an independent predictor of 
mortality in patients with ACLF grades 1 and 2. The overall 
prevalence of bacterial infections in patients ACLF-3 was so high 
(91%) that they did not impact prognosis.
The prevalence of fungal infections in our patients with ACLF 
was low (2%) and mainly occurred during the follow-up period 
after ACLF diagnosis. This figure is in line with recent studies 
showing a low incidence of invasive fungal infections in patients 
with cirrhosis admitted to ICU (1%).50 However, fungal infec￾tions could have been underestimated in our study since specific 
cultures were not performed. The relatively low rate of patients 
with ACLF-3 included in the canonic series (20%) could also 
explain this finding.
In summary, bacterial infections are a significant problem and a 
major prognostic determinant in patients with ACLF. Infections are 
detected at ACLF diagnosis in one-third of the patients. Among the 
remaining patients with ACLF, approximately half develop bacte￾rial infections within a follow-up period 4weeks. The severity of
systemic inflammation and of ACLF is significantly higher, the clin￾ical course significantly worse and mortality significantly higher in 
patients with ACLF and bacterial infections than in those without. 
Adequate empirical antibiotic strategies, infection control prac￾tices and prophylactic measures are essential in the management of 
patients with ACLF .
