Abstract: Extranodal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, is an uncommon lymphoma associated with
the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). It most commonly involves the nasal cavity and upper respiratory tract. Primary
pulmonary NK/T cell lymphoma is extremely rare. If a patient with a NK or T-cell tumor has an unusual reaction to
treatment or an unusual prognosis, it is wise to differentiate NK from T-cell tumors. The clinicopathologic
characteristics, immunophenotype, EBV in situ hybridization, and T cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement of
primary pulmonary NK cell lymphoma from a 73-year-old Chinese woman were investigated and the clonal status
was determined using female X-chromosomal inactivation mosaicism and polymorphisms at the phosphoglycerate
kinase (PGK) gene. The lesion showed the typical histopathologic characteristics and immunohistochemical features
of NK/T cell lymphoma. However, the sample was negative for TCR gene rearrangement. A clonality assay
demonstrated that the lesion was monoclonal. It is concluded that this is the first recorded case of genuine primary
pulmonary NK cell lymphoma. The purpose of the present work is to recommend that pathologists carefully
investigate the whole lesion to reduce the likelihood that primary pulmonary NK cell lymphoma will be
misdiagnosed as an infectious lesion. In addition, TCR gene rearrangement and clonal analysis, which is based on
female X-chromosomal inactivation mosaicism and polymorphisms at PGK and androgen receptor (AR) loci, were
found to play important roles in differentiating NK cell lymphoma from T cell lymphoma.

Introduction
Extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma, nasal type, is a rare
form of lymphoma. It often involves the nasal cavity and
usually presents as destructive lesions within the midline
facial structures. For this reason, it used to be called “le￾thal midline granuloma”. It has also been reported that,
in addition to the nasal cavity, NK/T cell lymphoma can
arise in the skin, gastrointestinal tract, testes, brain, sal￾ivary glands, pancreas, soft tissues, adrenal glands, and
bone marrow [1-3]. Although this illness can occur at
any age, it appears more often in people in their 50s and
affects more men than women [4,5]. Primary pulmonary
NK/T cell lymphoma is extremely rare. To the best of
our knowledge, only four cases have been reported in
the English-language journals [6-8]. Histopathologically,
these lesions usually show extensive coagulative necrosis
with atypical lymphocyte infiltration. They are often mis￾diagnosed as infarction or chronic inflammation if large
numbers of specimens are not carefully evaluated by pa￾thologists. No case of genuine primary pulmonary NK cell
lymphoma has yet been reported in English. In the present
study, a case of primary pulmonary NK cell lymphoma
from a 73-year-old Chinese female patient is reported and
its clinicopathological characteristics, immunophenotype,
EBV in situ hybridization, T cell receptor (TCR) gene re￾arrangement, and clonality are described.

Materials and methods
Sample
A 73-year-old female was referred to our hospital due to
a 2-month history of fever up to 38.5°C. At first, the pa￾tient thought that she had a cold and took oral antibi￾otics for 2 weeks. However, the fever did not resolve, so
she was subsequently admitted to a local hospital for
further study. A chest X-ray and computed tomography
(CT) showed that her right upper lung was atelectatic,
and tuberculosis was considered. The patient was then
treated with antituberculosis drugs for 2 weeks, but her
condition did not improve, so she came to Tangdu hos￾pital for further surgical management. Upon admission,
her blood count was normal, her human immunodefi￾ciency virus (HIV) test was negative, and she had normal
lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) levels of 130 U/L. In
addition, her plasma Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA levels
were 900 copies/ml. A repeat chest X-ray and CT revealed
a space-occupying lesion in the upper lobe of right lung
(Figure 1), which indicated central lung cancer with atel￾ectasis of the right upper lung. Simultaneously, a nodule
was found in the left upper lung. Based on these results
and at the request of her family, resection of her right
upper lung was performed. Written informed consent was
obtained from the patient and the protocol was approved
by the Institutional Ethics Committee of the Fourth Mili￾tary Medical University based on the Helsinki Declaration.
During the operation, a mass with an ill-defined boundary
was found in lung parenchyma neighboring to the hilum of
lung. The mass was dark red and medium in texture. A fro￾zen section examination was performed in order to deter￾mine the nature of the lesion. Macroscopically, the lesion
showed extensive coagulative necrosis and no evidence
of malignancy.
Methods
Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization
Immunohistochemical staining was performed using a
streptavidin-labeled peroxidase (S-P) KIT (KIT9730,XXX)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The primary
antibodies used in this study included mouse anti-human
monoclonal antibodies against leukocyte common antigen
(LCA), CD2, CD3, CD3ε, CD20, CD45RO, CD30, CD15,
CD56, CD68, CD99, BCL-2, BCL-6, latent membrane pro￾tein (LMP) 1, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), and
pan-cytokeratin (CK), CK18, rabbit anti-human polyclonal
antibodies against thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1),
Ki-67, surfactant protein B (SP-B), S-100 protein, and
smooth muscle actin (SMA), and an anti-pig monoclonal
antibody against vimentin. All reagents were supplied by
Maixin Biotechnology Corp. Ltd. (Fuzhou, China) but
LMP 1 was from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). EBV was de￾tected by in situ hybridization for EBER1 according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
Laser microdissection and DNA extraction
Eight 10 μm tissue sections (1.5×1.5 cm2
) were cut from
representing paraffin blocks and placed on a UV-absorbing
membrane. They were subjected to laser microdissection
using an LMD6000 (Leica Microsystems Ltd, Wetzlar,
Germany). After hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining,
the slides were mounted on a microstat, and the lymphoid
cells were then dissected using a UV laser in motorized op￾tical beam scanning mode. The dissectate (with the at￾tached specimen) was dropped by gravity into the cap of a
0.5 mL microcentrifuge tube that was filled with 40 μL lys￾ate buffer and 10 μL proteinase K. For each dissected le￾sion, a similar volume of surrounding normal lung tissue
was isolated and analyzed as a control. The microcen￾trifuge tubes were then placed in a water bath (48°C) to di￾gest the tissues. After digestion for 12 to 20 h, genomic
DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit
(Qiagen, Germany), examined using 2% agarose gel elec￾trophoresis, and stored at -20°C.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of TCR
PCR for assessment of T cell receptor gene rearrangement
was performed as described by InVivoScribe Technologies,

San Diego, CA (www.invivoscribe.com) and Bruggemann
et al. [9]. The reaction conditions were developed for a
final volume of 50 μL, consisting of 100 ng DNA, 200 μM
dNTP, 10 pmol of each primer irrespective of total num￾bers of primers in each multiplex PCR tube, 1.5 mM
MgCl2, and 1 U of Taq enzyme. Amplification was per￾formed using a PT-200 thermal cycler (MJ Research, Inc.,
MA, U. S.) for 35 cycles (denaturation at 95°C for 30 s,
annealing at 60°C for 40 s, and extension at 72°C for 30 s).
The products of TCR gene rearrangement were visualized
using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
PCR amplification for clonal assay
Nested PCR was used to detect single nucleotide poly￾morphism (SNP) sites in the PGK, as described previously
[10]. Ten-microliter aliquots of genomic DNA extracted
from lesion and non-lesion tissue samples were digested
with 5 U of Hpa II (Promega, WI, U.S.) at 37°C for 3 h in
a 20 μL reaction containing 0.2 μL bovine serum albumin
(BSA; 10 g/L) and 2 μL 10× reaction buffer. Then 5 μL ali￾quots of digested DNA samples were subjected to nested
PCR. The 50 μL reaction mixture consisted of 4 μL of 10
mM dNTPs (Gibco BRL, Life Technologies, Inc., MD, U.
S.), primers PGK1A and PGK1B (0.4 pmol each), 5 μL of
10× buffer, 1.5 μL of 50 mM MgCl2, and 2.5 U of Taq
DNA polymerase (Gibco BRL, MD, U.S.). Amplification
was performed using a PT-200 thermal cycler (MJ Re￾search, Inc., MA, U. S.) for 25 cycles (denaturation at 94°C
for 40 s, annealing at 56°C for 50 s, and extension at 72°C
for 1 min). PCR products from the first round (5 μL) were
used as a template for the second PCR reaction, which
was carried out with PGK2A and PGK2B primers using
the same amplification protocol. The PCR products were
digested with 5 U of Bst XI at 48°C for 8 to 10 h in a
20 μL reaction containing 0.2 μL of BSA (10 g/L) and 2 μL
of 10× reaction buffer. The digested products were visual￾ized using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis.
Analysis and assessment of PCR products for clonality assay
PCR gel images were recorded, and the PCR band inten￾sities for both alleles were quantitated using an image￾analyzing system (LabWorks 3.0, UVP, Cambridge, U.K.).
Loss of X chromosome inactivation mosaicism was de￾fined as a reduction in the intensity of fluorescence (≥
50%) for either band relative to that of PCR products that
did not undergo digestion. A corrected ratio (CR) was cal￾culated as the ratio of the intensity of the upper band to
that of the lower band before digestion divided by the ra￾tio of that of the upper band intensity to that of the lower
band intensity after digestion. In the present study, a CR
value ≥2 was used to define loss of X chromosome inacti￾vation mosaicism.
Results
Pathological observation
Grossly, the mass measured 5 cm × 4 cm × 4 cm, and
the cut surface was dark red. Microscopically, the lesion
showed extensive coagulative necrosis. However, alveolar
septa existed in some areas in which some medium￾sized atypical lymphoid cells with round to slightly ir￾regular nuclei were disseminated. Some tumor cells were
angiocentric and angiodestructive. Mitotic figures were
easily found (Figure 2). Immunohistochemically, the tumor
cells were strong positive for CD56, CD3ε, TIA1 (Figure 3),
and weak positive for LMP1, and negative for CD5, CD8,
CD20, CD79a, CgA, Syn, SCLC, CK, EMA, CD99, CD10,
TdT, PAX-5, and BCL-6. EBV in situ hybridization re￾vealed the tumor cells to be positive (Figure 3D).
TCR gene rearrangement-comment
Lanes 1 and 2 showed the TCRGA and TCRGB reaction
tubes, respectively. Lane 3 showed the TCRD reaction
tube. Lanes 5, 6, and 7 showed the TCRBA, TCRBB, and
TCRBC reaction tubes. The results, which included a
positive control, showed no band and no evidence of a
clonal gene rearrangement (Figure 4).
Determination of clonality
In the clonality assay, DNA samples analyzed without
Hpa II digestion showed two bands of equal intensity.
When DNA samples of the lesions were digested with
Hpa II, the down bands disappeared (Figure 5). These
results indicated that the lesion was monoclonal and
neoplastic. However, the intensities of the two bands
were equal to those of the surrounding normal lung tis￾sues treated with and without Hpa II.
Diagnosis and outcome
Based on the histopathological characteristics outlined
above and on immunohistochemical features and the re￾sults of TCR and PGK gene polymorphism analysis, the
patient was finally diagnosed with primary pulmonary
extranodal NK cell lymphoma. However, her family did
not believe this diagnosis and refused further treatment.
The patient had a persistent fever up to 39.4°C after sur￾gical excision. Most antibiotics were ineffective against
the fever, and only oral indomethacin anti-fever tablets
showed any results. The condition did not improve until
15 days after the operation. The patient died one month
after leaving the hospital.
Discussion
Primary pulmonary lymphoma (PPL) is defined as an
extranodal lymphoma that only arises from the lung par￾enchyma or bronchus [11]. PPL is rare, accounting for
3–4% of all extranodal lymphomas [12]. Most cases
reported in the lungs are B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma

(NHL) [13]. Non-B cell lymphomas, including T-cell and
NK cell lymphomas involving the lung parenchyma, are
seldom reported. Tamura and co-workers reported 24
cases of primary pulmonary lymphoma, only one of which
had originated in the T-cells [13]. The PubMed database
was searched going back to 1990, and only 16 cases of T￾cell lymphoma were found [6]. Primary lung NK/T cell
lymphoma is more rare, and only four cases have been
reported in the literature [6-8].
Clinically, patients with primary lung NK/T cell lymph￾oma usually present with cough, fever, and dyspnoea.
Treatment with antibiotics does not improve fever. Pleural
effusion has also been reported. The most common radio￾graphic findings are bilateral diffuse nodular lesions with

positive for CD56 (Figure 3A, 200×), CD3ε (Figure 3B, 200×), and TIA-1 (Figure 3C, 200×); the tumor cells was positive for EBV in situ hybridization
(Figure 3D, 200×).

tumor cells were angiocentric and angiodestructive. Mitotic figures were easily found. (Figure 2A, 200×; Figure 2B, 200×; Figure 2C, 400×;
Figure 2D, 200×).

mass-like consolidation. Histopathologically, nasal-type
NK/T cell lymphoma has a characteristic histologic pat￾tern, which is often angiocentric with prominent necrosis
and vascular destruction. For this reason, most NK/T
lymphomas may show extensive necrosis and are thus easily
misdiagnosed as infectious lesions. Immunohistochemically,
the tumor cells tend to express CD56, cytoplasmic CD3ε,
CD2, cytotoxic granule proteins, granzyme B, and TIA-1
but not surface CD3. Of course, some special cases, such as
CD20-positive NK/T-cell lymphoma, have been reported
[14-16]. In this case, the tumor cells were negative for
CD20. Thus, a diagnosis of NK/T cell lymphoma was first
considered based on the histopathological characteristics
and typical immunohistochemical features outlined above.
Moreover, there were no skin eruptions, and no evidence of
lymphoma involvement was found in the nasal endoscopy
and positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging. A bone
marrow biopsy was also negative. In this way, a diagnosis of
primary pulmonary extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma, nasal
type was made.
Extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma is an uncommon sub￾type of NHL. It is derived from either activated NK cells
or, rarely, cytotoxic T-cells [17]. If a patient with NK or
T-cell tumors has unusual reactions to treatment or un￾usual prognosis [18], it is better to differentiate the NK
tumors from the T-cell tumors in our opinion. Simultan￾eously, several studies have demonstrated that it is ne￾cessary to elucidate the origin of NK/T cell lymphoma

indicated negative control.

bands disappeared.

[18,19]. Unfortunately, related research is still very lim￾ited. Thus, our issue is to determine whether the tumor
originated from NK or T cells.
Monoclonality is one of the main features of most tu￾mors, but normal and reactive hyperplastic lesions are
polyclonal [20]. Clonal analysis techniques, including T￾cell and B-cell receptor gene rearrangement and one tech￾nique based on X-chromosome inactivation mosaicism
and polymorphisms at the PGK and AR loci in female
somatic cells, play an important role in differentiating
neoplasm from reactive hyperplasia. In particular, T-cell
receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement may be used to dis￾tinguish NK/T-cell lymphoma from T-cell lymphoma. If
TCR gene rearrangement shows a clonal pattern, the
tumor is of T-cell origin. If negative, a diagnosis of NK/T
cell lymphoma can be made [21]. The point has been con￾firmed by many NK/T cell lymphoma reported in the lit￾erature [22]. That is to say, determination of TCR gene
rearrangement by PCR-based analysis may not be useful
for making diagnosis of extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma.
In the present study, DNA was isolated from paraffin￾embedded tissue samples and analyzed for TCR gene re￾arrangement using PCR-based techniques. The results
showed no evidence of clonal gene rearrangement. As
pointed out by Mansoor et al., this condition seemed to be
diagnosed as NK-cell lymphoproliferative lesions, specific￾ally polyclonal lesions [23]. However, the truth of the mat￾ter was quite different.
Clonality assays, which are based on X-chromosome
inactivation mosaicism and polymorphisms at the PGK
and AR loci in female somatic cells, are a very important
means of differentiating neoplasm from reactive hyperpla￾sia. The principle behind this assay is that each female
somatic cell contains two X chromosomes, one of which
is randomly inactivated by methylation during early em￾bryogenesis and the other of which retains its genetic ac￾tivity throughout life. PGK gene polymorphism shows the
presence of a single nucleotide polymorphic site identified
by Bst XI located downstream of the methylation site. AR
polymorphism shows different lengths of CAG short￾tandem repeats (STR) at exon 1 [24]. After digestion with
the methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme Hha I, nor￾mal and reactive hyperplastic tissues with polymorphisms
show two alleles of equal intensity. Neoplastic tissues
show only one of the two alleles, with obviously reduced
intensity. This lesion should be diagnosed as true NK cell
lymphoma or T cell lymphoma if it shows a monoclonal
pattern based on the histopathological features, immuno￾histochemical characteristics, and TCR. In the present
study, the clonal status of the lesion was evaluated using
laser microdissection and a clonal assay to further confirm
the conclusion. The results demonstrated that the lesion
was monoclonal hyperplasia, which supported the diagno￾sis of true NK-cell lymphoma. Six of the eight patients
described by Mansoor et al. were female [23]. For this rea￾son, clonality assays are here recommended as a means of
confirming the nature of these lesions. Moreover, TCR
gene rearrangement was not performed in any of the four
cases reported in the literature [6-8]. This suggests that
the diagnosis of NK cell lymphoma of the lung was not
confirmed. Of course, this method has its limitations. Spe￾cifically, it can only be used to analyze samples from female
individuals. Thus, the diagnosis of most patients with NK/T
cell lymphoma still depends upon morphology, immuno￾phenotype, EBER in situ hybridization, and TCR gene
rearrangement.
Remarkably, there are many similarities between extra￾nodal NK/T cell lymphoma with advanced stage and ag￾gressive natural killer cell leukemia/lymphoma, such as
the morphology, immunophenotype, germline configur￾ation of TCR gene and EBV association [25]. However,
Kwong et al. [26] has pointed out the latter can be dif￾ferent from the former by the absence of a previous his￾tory, a shorter illness, a younger age of presentation and
an extremely aggressive course. In our case, the blood
count was normal, and the tumor cells did not involve
in bone marrow, liver, and spleen. Moreover, the patient
was an older female except showing a short survival
time. Thus, we considered that it should be diagnosed as
extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma.
The prognosis of primary pulmonary NK/T-cell lymph￾oma is very poor, although aggressive treatments with
CHOP-based chemotherapy and surgical resection have
been reported in the literature. Among the four patients
with primary pulmonary NK/T cell lymphoma, the longest
life expectancy was less than 6 months [5]. Recently, some
studies demonstrated that the expression of both LMP1
and LMP2A showed significant correlations with the
prognosis of patients with extranodal NK/T cell lymph￾oma [27]. In our case, the tumor cells were positive for
LMP1. Therefore, the patient died 1 month after leaving
the hospital, which supported the conclusion. Moreover, it
appears to be very difficult to diagnose NK/T cell lymph￾oma because of the associated extensive necrosis and vari￾able morphology. In the present case, frozen sections were
examined twice during the operation, and the results
showed microscopically extensive coagulative necrosis.
Fortunately, the patient underwent a lobectomy and con￾sented to allow pathologists to examine a large number of
sections.
In conclusion, this is the first reported case of genuine
primary pulmonary NK cell lymphoma. Pathologists should
carefully investigate the whole lesion when extensive coagu￾lative necrosis with atypical lymphocyte infiltration is ob￾served in a major lesion. This renders primary pulmonary
NK cell lymphoma less likely to be misdiagnosed as an in￾fectious lesion. In addition, TCR gene rearrangement and
clonal assays based on the polymorphisms of PGK and AR

and X-chromosomal inactivation mosaicism should be per￾formed in any somatic tissue samples taken from female
patients.
