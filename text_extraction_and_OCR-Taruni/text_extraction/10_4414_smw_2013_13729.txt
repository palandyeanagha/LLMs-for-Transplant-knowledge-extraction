Summary
Heart transplantation is only available for a limited number
of patients with end-stage heart failure. Since the arrival
of newer ventricular assist devices, mechanical circulatory
support constitutes an alternative therapy for patients with
advanced heart failure. The first-generation of pulsatile￾flow devices were used only for bridging the sickest pa￾tients to transplantation. Frequent adverse events, limited
durability and the patients’ discomfort made them unsuit￾able for lifetime support. The second-generation
continuous-flow devices were smaller, quieter and more
durable. Survival rates of patients improved significantly.
This led to a marked growth of device implantations,
largely caused by an increase of lifetime support. Survival
of destination therapy patients is somewhat inferior to the
survival of bridge-to-transplant patients, in part due to their
co-morbid conditions which limit life expectancy. A sub￾group of patients on destination therapy with advanced, but
stable heart failure and a low-risk profile reach short-term
survival rates equal or superior to the survival after heart
transplantation. These patients may be offered the choice of
destination therapy versus heart transplantation. However
it remains unclear if long-term survival, quality of life and
functional status on lifetime support can compete with the
excellent results after transplantation. A trend to implant￾ing devices at earlier stages of heart failure has begun. In
a current trial, patients with advanced, but stable heart fail￾ure are randomised to destination therapy versus optimal
medical therapy. The results of this trial will be expected to
more precisely determine the place of mechanical circulat￾ory support in the treatment of advanced heart failure.

Introduction
Heart transplantation is still being considered the gold
standard for treatment of patients with end-stage heart fail￾ure. The actual 1-year survival following heart transplant￾ation reaches 84% world-wide, according to the registry of
the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplanta￾tion (ISHLT) [1]. While the number of patients listed for
heart transplantation is steadily increasing, the quantity of
heart transplantations has remained similar over the last
years. This is a world-wide phenomenon which is well￾known in Switzerland, in the Eurotransplant region as well
as internationally [1–3]. From 2008 to 2011, the number
of patients on the heart transplant waiting list in Switzer￾land increased by nearly 50%, but the total count of heart
transplants only grew by 24% [3]. In the Eurotransplant
countries, the amount of patients listed for heart transplant￾ation doubled in the period from 2003 to 2011, whereas the
number of heart transplants stayed the same [2]. In addi￾tion, there is a growing portion of patients with severely
advanced heart failure who are not transplant candidates
because of coexisting conditions such as advanced age or
complications from renal disease and diabetes. This is the
consequence of advancements in medical therapy which
has helped to extend life expectancy without preventing
progression of heart failure. In this context, mechanical cir￾culatory support becomes an attractive alternative for the
treatment of end-stage heart failure, particularly since tech￾nology has made rapid progress over the last few years.
Mechanical circulatory support in end￾stage heart failure – from rescue
therapy for transplant candidates to a
transplant alternative
Heart transplantation can only be offered to a limited num￾ber of patients due to the shortage of donor organs, and
its long-term complications such as chronic allograft vas￾culopathy and malignancy are still not controlled. In this
light, mechanical circulatory support has gained increasing
interest as an alternative to heart transplantation. Origin￾ally, ventricular assist devices were only used for tempor￾ary support to give the sickest patients on the waiting list
the chance to survive until heart transplantation. In the
landmark REMATCH trial, mechanical circulatory support

devices were tested as lifetime therapy versus medical ther￾apy, for the first time in history [4]. Patients with symptoms
of NYHA class IV heart failure and ineligible for heart
transplantation were randomised to receive a left ventricu￾lar assist device versus optical medical therapy (OMT)
only. In the device group, there was a significant reduction
in the risk of death from any cause, compared with the
OMT group. Survival at one year was significantly higher
in the device group (52%) than in the OMT group (25%).
After two years, there was still a trend to better survival
in the device (23%) as opposed to the OMT patients (8%).
However, adverse events such as bleeding, neurologic dys￾function, device related infections and device failure con￾tinued to impair the survival benefit of the device patients.
In the REMATCH trial, the HeartMate I (originally Thermo
Cardiosystems, Inc., Woburn, MA, USA; now: Thoratec
Inc., Pleasanton, CA, USA) was used for mechanical sup￾port (fig. 1A). It represents the group of first-generation
pulsatile-flow devices which also included the Novacor
N100 (originally Baxter, later World Heart Inc., Ottawa,
Canada). As they were displacement pumps consisting of a
large housing weighing >1 kg, they did not fit into the peri￾cardium and needed to be implanted inside the abdominal
wall or intra-peritoneally. From the beginning of mechanic￾al circulatory support in the mid 1980s, such devices were
primarily used for temporary support to give patients with
an imminent risk of death on the waiting list the chance
to survive until heart transplantation. Although the pumps
were successful in bridging 60–70% of patients to heart
transplantation, they were associated with a multitude of
adverse events, such as bleeding, thrombus formation caus￾ing stroke and peripheral embolism, infection, and mech￾anical wear requiring device exchange [5, 6].
In addition, the large size and noise affected the patients’
well-being significantly. These shortcomings prevented

such devices from being used in a larger patient population.
Not surprisingly, infection and failure of the HeartMate I
device were prominent events which influenced the res￾ults of the device group in the REMATCH trial unfavour￾ably. Thus, the most common causes of death in the device
group were sepsis (41% of deaths), most frequently result￾ing from device-related infection, and device failure (17%
of deaths). Within the first three months after implantation,
the probability of device-related infection was as high as
28%. At 2 years after implantation, the probability of
device failure was 35%, and the device had to be replaced
in 15% of patients [4].
Technical advancement of devices
improves results – destination
therapy becomes an attractive option
At the time when the REMATCH trial was ongoing, axial￾flow pumps were introduced into clinical use. These so￾called “second-generation” devices used an impeller to
convey the blood resulting in a continuous flow. Hereby,
the pump size could be markedly reduced. Implantation in￾Figure 2

side the pericardium became possible. The first such pump
which was used clinically was the MicroMed DeBakey
VAD (MicroMed Cardiovascular, Inc., Houston, TX,
USA). However, following a wave of enthusiasm, the ex￾pectations with the pump were not met. The formation of
thrombus inside the pump was a frequent adverse event
which largely contributed to the disappointing outcomes.
Survival on the pump of <60% could not compete with
that of first-generation devices [7]. With the availability of
further refined axial-flow pumps such as the Jarvik 2000
(Jarvik Heart, Inc., New York, NY, USA), the Berlin Heart
Incor (Berlin Heart GmbH, Berlin, Germany) and the
HeartMate II (Thoratec Inc., Pleasanton, CA, USA) (fig.
1B), the results with second-generation pumps improved
markedly [8–10]. Since they were smaller (fig. 1C), with
less noise and more durable than the first-generation
pulsatile pumps, the patient comfort increased consider￾ably. In the light of these advantages, they were thought
to be more suitable for long-term support than the first￾generation pulsatile pumps. As a consequence, a trial was
launched to compare both device groups in end-stage heart
failure patients who were not transplant candidates. Sub￾sequently, patients in heart failure NYHA functional class
IIIb or IV who were ineligible for heart transplantation
were randomised prospectively to receive either the first￾generation pulsatile-flow pump HeartMate I or the
continuous-flow pump HeartMate II [11]. Survival at one
and two years was significantly better in patients who were
on a continuous-flow device (68% and 58%, respectively)
compared to those who had a pulsatile-flow pump (55%
and 24%, respectively) (fig. 2). Equally important, there
were significant reductions in the rates of major adverse
events among patients with a continuous-flow left ventricu￾lar assist device. In particular, the incidence of device￾related infection and sepsis as well as the frequency of
pump replacement were significantly reduced in patients
with a continuous-flow device as compared with those on
a pulsatile-flow pump. While valve or bearing failures oc￾curred frequently in the pulsatile-flow pumps, there were
no primary pump or bearing failures in the continuous￾Figure 4

flow devices. Replacement of continuous-flow pumps was
mainly required because of damage to the percutaneous
controller lead. In this so-called HeartMate II destination
therapy trial, the survival rate of patients with the
HeartMate I was similar to the outcome among patients
with the HeartMate I in the REMATCH trial. This indicates
that, over a period of eight years since the REMATCH trial,
there was no progress in survival with pulsatile-pumps,
despite advances in peri- and postoperative management.
In contrast, the 2-year survival of patients with a
continuous-flow device was more than double compared to
patients with pulsatile-flow pumps (fig. 1) [12].
The success of continuous-flow pumps is also depicted
in the most recent 4
th report of the Interagency Registry
for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support
(INTERMACS) [13]. This database analyses United States
Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved durable
mechanical circulatory support device implants in the Un￾ited States. It now oversees five years of patient enrolment
from 2006 to 2011. Overall survival on ventricular assist
devices has progressively improved since 2006. In the most
recent experience of the years 2010 and 2011, actuarial sur￾vival at one year amounts to 82% which is significantly
higher than the 1-year survival of about 62% in the period
of 2006 and 2007 (fig. 3). This is mainly caused by the
excellent results in patients with continuous-flow pumps
which experienced a dramatic increase of implants in re￾cent years. In 2010, more than 95% of all implants were
continuous-flow devices, and the number is still increasing.
If stratified by pump type, it could be shown that the out￾come of patients on continuous-flow pumps was signific￾antly better than in patients who had a pulsatile-flow pump.
Thus, survival at one year following implant was 82% for
continuous-flow devices compared to only 61% in patients
with pulsatile-flow pumps. After two years, 74% of pa￾tients on continuous-flow-pumps were still alive, as op￾posed to only 43% of patients with pulsatile-flow devices
(fig. 4). As a consequence of the improved results with
second-generation devices, the European Society of Cardi￾ology upgraded the recommendation for destination ther￾apy in the 2012 version of the Guidelines on the diagnosis
and treatment of heart failure from a class IIb to a class IIa
level B recommendation [14].
In the INTERMACS report no analysis was made with re￾spect to survival of patients on continuous-flow pumps,
stratified by year of implant. As already outlined above,
having an implant, no matter if continuous-flow or
pulsatile-flow, in the era 2010–2011 increased survival
(82% at 1 year) as compared to previous years. In addition,
being on a continuous-flow device between 2006 and 2011
also improved survival (at 1 year: 82%) compared to being
on a pulsatile-flow device (at 1 year: 61%). Taken together,
one might assume that 1-year survival of patients who
received a continuous-flow device in 2010–2011 is even
higher than 82% if one considers that the calculation by
era included all pump types, not only the continuous-flow
devices. Then, 1-year survival of patients who undergo a
continuous-flow implant in the current era would reach val￾ues very much equal to the 1-year survival following heart
transplantation which presently reaches 84% [1].

If one compares survival of primary continuous-flow im￾plants according to the initial device strategy, data from
INTERMACS show that survival of destination therapy pa￾tients comes close to that of bridge-to-transplant patients.
One and two years after implant, survival of patients on
destination therapy amounts to 78% and 72%, respectively,
as compared to 89% and 86%in patients bridged to trans￾plant, respectively [13]. The inferior survival rate of pa￾tients on destination therapy, compared to transplant can￾didates, is largely explained by the co-morbid conditions
which make them ineligible for transplantation and have an
unfavourable impact on life expectancy. It may also play
a role that such patients are not considered for transplant￾ation as rescue therapy in case of life-threatening device
complications. In the light of the 2010–2011 INTERMACS
data, it would be interesting to stratify the survival of pa￾tients on continuous-flow destination therapy by the im￾plant year. It can be expected that patients on destination
therapy would currently have a 1-year survival exceeding
the 78% which reflect the analysis over the whole time
period from 2006 to 2011.
Better outcome of destination therapy
in patients with lower risk –
destination therapy challenges heart
transplantation
The INTERMACS survival analyses included patients with
all risk profiles and did not differentiate for various risk
classes such as INTERMACS levels 1–7. A risk factor
analysis for the entire cohort identified cardiogenic shock,
corresponding with INTERMACS level 1, as one of the
most prominent risk factors for death within the first three
months after implant. Other risk factors for early death
were INTERMACS level 2, older age, history of cardiac
surgery (CABG or valve) and deteriorating renal or hepatic
function [13]. It is assumed that patients with less advanced
heart failure and a lower risk profile at the time of im￾plantation have better outcomes. An attempt was made

by three US institutions to stratify clinical outcomes fol￾lowing continuous-flow device implants by the preoperat￾ive risk according to the INTERMACS classification [15].
Not surprisingly, survival was greater the less sick the pa￾tients were before implantation. Patients with ambulatory
advanced heart failure (INTERMACS level 4–7) had a sig￾nificant better 3-year survival as compared to patients in
cardiogenic shock (INTERMACS 1) (95.8% vs 51.1%, p
= 0.011). There was also a trend that 3-year survival of
patients with INTERMACS level 4–7 was superior to that
of inotrope-dependent patients (INTERMACS 2-3) (95.8%
vs. 68.8%, p = 0.065). Survival of patients in
INTERMACS level 1 was not different from survival of
patients in INTERMACS levels 2–3 (51.1% vs. 68.8%, p
= 0.18). The validity of these results is limited since it
was a retrospective study across multiple sites, the size
of the groups was relatively small, the distribution of pa￾tients across the groups was not even, and some baseline
characteristics, such as age, were different between groups.
Moreover, the study did not discriminate between bridge￾to-transplant patients and patients on lifetime support.
To further improve the outcomes of destination therapy,
careful patient selection will be of paramount importance.
Patients for destination therapy should not be too sick and
should be offered all other heart failure treatment options
including OMT, AICD and cardiac synchronisation therapy
as indicated by current guidelines. Various risk scores have
been implemented to predict outcomes for patients with
advanced heart failure, such as the Heart Failure Survival
Score, and the Seattle Heart Failure Model. These models,
however, have yet to be validated for patients who will
undergo destination therapy using current continuous-flow
LVADs [16]. The Destination Therapy Risk Score was the
first risk prediction tool which was designed to evaluate pa￾tients for destination therapy. It was developed to predict
the risk of 90-day in-hospital mortality in patients on
pulsatile-flow LVADs as destination therapy [17]. Data
were derived from a post-market surveillance study of the
pulsatile-flow HeartMate I XVE LVAD, implanted for life￾Figure 6

time support. Due to the lack of other risk scores for des￾tination therapy, the use of the Destination Therapy Risk
Score was eventually extended to patients implanted with
continuous-flow devices as lifetime support. However,
when it was evaluated in a contemporary cohort of patients
with a continuous-flow device as bridge-to-transplant or
destination therapy, it became apparent that its utility in
such populations was very limited [18]. Therefore, im￾proved risk prediction models derived from the current era
of continuous-flow LVAD implants are in urgent need and
presently in development. In addition to the severity of
advanced heart failure, as reflected by the INTERMACS
profiles, co-morbidities have to be considered carefully
when selecting patients for destination therapy. Irreversible
end-organ failure, stroke, severe chronic obstructive lung
disease and cancer limiting life expectancy to less than
2 years, psychiatric disorders and lack of social support
may influence outcome of lifetime support negatively and
should be considered as contraindication [16, 19].
In a recent study, an attempt was made for the first time to
correlate different stages of heart failure and various preop￾erative risk profiles with the outcomes of destination ther￾apy patients [20]. Nearly 1300 patients registered in the
INTERMACS database from 2006 to 2011 were subject
of this analysis, 1160 of which were implanted with
continuous-flow devices for destination therapy. Use of
a pulsatile-flow device, cardiogenic shock (INTERMACS
level 1), use of a right ventricular assist device, history of
cancer, history of cardiac surgery, older age, larger body
mass index, dialysis and increased blood urea nitrogen
were identified as risk factors for mortality. When patients
on continuous-flow device destination therapy were strat￾ified by severity of heart failure according to the
INTERMACS profiles, it could be shown that 1-year sur￾vival of patients with advanced, but stable heart failure
(INTERMACS levels 3–7) was superior (ca. 82%) to sur￾vival of patients in INTERMACS level 1 (cardiogenic
shock, ca. 62%) and INTERMACS level 2 (depending on
inotropes with progressive decline, ca. 75%) (fig. 5). Based
on the risk factor analysis, patients with INTERMACS
levels 3–7 were further classified into groups with low risk
(no risk factor, no prior cardiac surgery), medium risk (no
risk factor, but prior cardiac surgery) and high risk (risk
factors such as BVAD, cancer, BMI >32, BUN >50, dia￾lysis, age >75 yrs). Survival of the low risk group at 1 and
2 years amounted to 89% and 80%, respectively, which
displayed a strong trend to be superior to survival of the
medium risk (81% and 65%, respectively) and high risk
(77% and 72%, respectively) group (fig. 6) [20]. Thus, the
outcome of continuous-flow device destination therapy pa￾tients with advanced, but stable heart failure and a low risk
profile competes favourably with survival at 1 and 2 years
following heart transplantation in the current era (84.4%
and 80.9%, respectively) [1].
On the basis of these analyses, the triage of selected pa￾tients from transplant to destination therapy may become
debatable. The profile of such patients would include ad￾vanced, heart failure in stable condition, the implant of a
continuous-flow device, absence of severe right ventricular
failure, preserved renal function, body mass index and age
suitable for transplant, no history of cardiac surgery, and
no cancer [20]. The question remains whether the predicted
2-year survival is of sufficient duration for a paradigm shift
from transplant to destination therapy. Maximal follow-up
of patients on continuous-flow device destination therapy
is currently only exceeding little more than 2 years and
there is uncertainty about long-term survival [20]. In con￾trast, follow-up after heart transplantation now extends to
almost 30 years, with excellent long-term survival [1]. In
addition to survival, other outcome measures such as qual￾ity of life and functional capacity will have to be com￾pared between patients on continuous-flow device destina￾tion therapy and transplant patients in order to further de￾termine the role of lifetime mechanical circulatory support
in heart failure therapy. Therefore, a prospective, controlled
trial is suggested randomising selected patients to heart
transplantation versus destination therapy. The results of
continuous-flow implants have improved sufficiently that
such a study can be ethically justified. In this discussion
of destination therapy versus heart transplantation, one has
to keep in mind that, since the REMATCH trial was per￾formed, there has been no randomised comparison of sur￾vival and functional status with modern LVADs against
contemporary medical therapy. Such a trial would also be
of particular interest, because, parallel to the advancement
of LVAD technology, outcomes with ambulatory cardiac
failure have improved with targeted use of medical treat￾ment, resynchronisation therapy, and cardiac failure man￾agement.
Destination therapy in “less sick”
patients before they are typical
transplant candidates
The success of continuous-flow devices has raised the
question, regarding if the “less sick” heart failure patients
should be a target for VAD therapy [21]. However, data
from current trials would not justify implantation of
LVADs into patients with class III symptoms. Traditionally,
destination therapy has been limited to those advanced
heart failure patients who are not eligible for transplant￾ation, have less than 2 years of life expectancy, are on
maximal heart failure medication and after implantation of
AICD/CRT devices as indicated. Since the outcomes of
destination therapy patients have improved markedly, there
is already a clear trend for a shift to implant patients with
a lesser grade of heart failure for lifetime support [13]. The
“less sick” patients are considered to be advanced heart
failure patients who are non-inotrope dependent and ambu￾latory, qualifying for INTERMACS levels 4–7. The natural
course of such patients, if treated medically and with resyn￾chronisation devices, is associated with a survival at 1 and
2 years of ca. 80% and 75%, respectively [21, 22]. Destin￾ation therapy in these patients must at least reach results
equal or superior to the outcome of conservative manage￾ment. A retrospective, single-centre study, compared pa￾tients in INTERMACS levels 4–6 receiving VAD therapy
with their predicted survival without VAD, according to
the Seattle Heart Failure Model [23]. The survival at one
and two years following VAD implantation reached 85%
and 80%, respectively, which was superior to the Seattle
Heart Failure Model predicted survival, with an absolute
Review article: Current opinion Swiss Med Wkly. 2013;143:w13729

reduction of 27% in mortality at 2 years. In this setting,
however, one has to be aware that the net benefit for the pa￾tient with respect to survival is attenuated because the nat￾ural prognosis of the disease is also more favourable [21].
Destination therapy in such patients has to prove that it
also enhances quality of life and functional status signific￾antly, compared to optimal medical therapy. In the light of
these uncertainties, a prospective, randomised, controlled
trial was initiated to assess the use of chronic VAD ther￾apy in patients who are less ill than those currently eligible
for destination therapy. The trial became known as the
REVIVE-IT pilot trial (Randomized Evaluation of VAD
InterVEntion before Inotropic Therapy) and randomises
VAD versus optimal medical therapy [24]. The hypothes￾is is that VAD therapy may improve survival, functional
status and quality of life in those advanced heart failure pa￾tients who are neither inotrope-dependent nor exercise-in￾tolerant and have not yet developed serious consequences
from heart failure such as malnourishment, end-organ dam￾age, and immobility. The results of the trial are expected
with eagerness, the estimated primary completion date will
be January 2015. The trial will further elucidate the role of
current VAD therapy in the management of advanced heart
failure. In the context of the evolving role of VADs, it is
emphasised that this highly sophisticated treatment should
be performed within an integrated program of care which
offers all options including optimisation of medical and re￾synchronisation therapy as well as heart transplantation un￾der the guidance of a dedicated team focusing on the pa￾tients’ preferences for heart failure management.
Conclusion
The technological advancement of current continuous-flow
devices, as compared to the previous pulsatile-flow pumps,
has led to a marked improvement in survival of patients
on support. This has caused a dramatic increase of device
implants over the last 2–3 years. The growth has largely
been driven by the broader application of destination ther￾apy. A subset of patients with less severe end-stage heart
failure who have a low risk profile reaches a survival at 1
and 2 years at least equal to the survival following heart
transplantation. It is time to offer such patients the chance
to choose between transplant and lifetime support. A pre￾requisite for doing so is that the patient is informed about
the uncertainty of long-term outcomes on destination ther￾apy. To obtain solid data about the true value of both des￾tination therapy and heart transplantation in end-stage heart
failure, a randomised trial of contemporary VAD systems
versus transplant is required. Since results of continuous￾flow destination therapy implants have improved with se￾lecting patients at lower risk, a shift to treat patients with
lifetime support in earlier and less severe stages of heart
failure has begun. A randomised trial allocating long-term
device therapy to patients before they would probably be
considered for heart transplantation is already underway.
Since the survival benefit of destination therapy in “less
sick” patients may be lower than in end-stage heart failure
patients, the success of continuous-flow destination ther￾apy in this patient population will be closely associated
with its ability to significantly improve quality of life and
functional status, as compared to optimal medical therapy.
