Deregulation of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling increases the risk for metabolic
diseases, including type 2 diabetes. Here we show that b-cell-specific loss of mTORC1 causes
diabetes and b-cell failure due to defects in proliferation, autophagy, apoptosis and insulin
secretion by using mice with conditional (braKO) and inducible (MIP-braKOf/f) raptor
deletion. Through genetic reconstitution of mTORC1 downstream targets, we identify
mTORC1/S6K pathway as the mechanism by which mTORC1 regulates b-cell apoptosis, size
and autophagy, whereas mTORC1/4E-BP2-eIF4E pathway regulates b-cell proliferation.
Restoration of both pathways partially recovers b-cell mass and hyperglycaemia. This study
also demonstrates a central role of mTORC1 in controlling insulin processing by regulating
cap-dependent translation of carboxypeptidase E in a 4EBP2/eIF4E-dependent manner.
Rapamycin treatment decreases CPE expression and insulin secretion in mice and human
islets. We suggest an important role of mTORC1 in b-cells and identify downstream pathways
driving b-cell mass, function and insulin processing.

mTOR pathway links upstream nutrient availability and
growth factor signalling to control metabolism, cell
growth, proliferation and protein synthesis by phos￾phorylation of key components1–3. Growing evidence indicates
that mTOR signalling pathway is deregulated in human diseases,
including type 2 diabetes4–6. The importance of mTOR signalling
in regulation of insulin sensitivity has been demonstrated5.
However, how alterations of this pathway in b-cells contribute to
the pathogenesis of diabetes is less understood.
mTOR functions in two distinct multi-protein complexes
termed mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2. mTORC1
constitutes the rapamycin-sensitive arm of mTOR signalling and
contains six components, including mTOR, mLst/GbL, Deptor,
Tti1/Tel2 complex, Raptor and PRAS40 (ref. 7). Raptor and
PRAS40 are specific to the mTORC1 complex, and deletion of
Raptor inactivates this complex. mTORC1 controls cell size,
proliferation, ribosomal biogenesis, protein translation and
autophagy by modulating eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BP1, 2
and 3) and ribosomal protein S6 kinases (S6K1 and 2) and ULK
among others1,3. S6K phosphorylates downstream substrates,
such as ribosomal S6 protein and eIF4B, to promote mRNA
translation and synthesis of ribosomes. Phosphorylation of
4E-BPs triggers their release from eIF4E and initiates cap￾dependent translation of mRNAs with complex 50
-untranslated
region (UTR) structures. Loss of mTORC1 signalling in liver,
muscle and adipocytes by tissue-specific deletion of raptor
demonstrate that mTORC1 contributes to the control of
metabolism and energy homeostasis in a tissue-specific
manner8–11. In addition, the use of mTORC1 inhibitors
(rapamycin) and analogues (rapalogs) has provided information
about the role of this pathway in human disease and further
suggest that this pathway is involved in human diabetes12.
The current studies uncover the role of endogenous mTORC1
signalling in b-cells using mice with conditional raptor deletion in
b-cells (braKO). This deletion results in b-cell failure and
diabetes by reduction in proliferation, cell size and survival. Using
mice with inducible deletion of raptor in mature b-cells, we
identify a novel role of mTORC1 on insulin secretion. To
investigate mechanistically how mTORC1 inactivation induces
b-cell failure, we perform genetic reconstitution of 4E-BP1-2/
eIF4E or S6K activity in braKO mice. Genetic reconstitution of
4E-BPs/eIF4E and S6K signalling in braKO mice shows that
mTORC1 orchestrates a signalling response to regulate cell
survival, b-cell mass and insulin secretion. Moreover, we find a
novel role for the mTORC1/4E-BP2/eIF4E arm in the regulation
of insulin processing by controlling cap-dependent translation of
carboxypeptidase E (CPE). Finally, rapamycin treatment in mice
and human islets recapitulates the effect of mTORC1 on CPE,
suggesting that this mechanism could be relevant to humans
treated with this agent.
Results
Disruption of mTORC1 in b-cells causes diabetes. To inactivate
mTORC1 function, we generated mice with homozygous deletion
of raptor in b-cells by crossing raptorf/f with Rip-Cre mice
(braKO)
8,13. braKO islets exhibited a reduction in B80% of
Raptor levels leading to a decrease in the phosphorylation of the
mTORC1 targets 4E-BP1 and S6 protein (Fig. 1a and
Supplementary Fig. 1). The remaining Raptor and p-S6
detected in isolated islets are likely due to immunoreactivity
coming from non-b-cells, islet culture conditions with growth
factors and phosphorylation of S6K by other pathways14–17. The
fall in p-S6 in b-cells was also observed in pancreas sections
(Supplementary Fig. 2a). Furthermore, braKO mice when crossed
to CAG-GFP reporter mice showed that 95% of insulin-positive
cells were also positive for green fluorescent protein (GFP)
indicating that this Cre-recombinase line induced recombination
in the majority of b-cells (Supplementary Fig. 2b). GFP
fluorescence was not observed in glucagon cells or in other
areas of the pancreas at 30 days of age suggesting there was no
conversion to other cell fates (Supplementary Fig. 2b). These
studies clearly demonstrate successful inactivation of mTORC1
signalling specific to b-cells. Assessment of glucose homeostasis
showed that random blood fed glucose and insulin levels in
braKO mice were normal during the first 3 weeks of life
(Fig. 1b,c). However, glucose levels in male and female mice
progressively increased and these mice exhibited severe diabetes
in adulthood, accompanied by hypoinsulinaemia (Fig. 1b,c and
Supplementary Fig. 3a). In contrast, deletion of only one raptor
allele (heterozygous mice) displayed normal fed glucose levels,
glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity (Fig. 1b and
Supplementary Fig. 3b,c). These studies suggested that impaired
mTORC1 signalling leads to hyperglycaemia and diabetes.
braKO mice showed progressive reduction in b-cell mass by
decreases in proliferation, survival and cell size. b-cell mass is a
critical determinant for glucose homeostasis in rodents and
humans. braKO mice were born with normal b-cell mass
(Supplementary Fig. 4a–d). However, b-cell mass was reduced
by B40% (Fig. 1d) due to less proliferation and greater apoptosis
at 30 days of age (Fig. 1e,f), but this was not sufficient to alter
glucose tolerance (Supplementary Fig. 4e) or random glucose
levels as described above (Fig. 1b). Glucose-induced b-cell
proliferation was also diminished in 30-day-old braKO islets
(Fig. 1g). The reduction in b-cell mass was not associated to
changes in pancreatic glucagon content (0.2812±0.0308 versus
0.2806±0.029, ng per mg protein, n ¼ 4, P ¼ 0.0571, data
expressed as means±s.e.m.; nonparametric U-test, Mann–
Whitney), although staining for non-b-cells showed that the
number of glucagon and somatostatin cells appeared to be
increased (Supplementary Fig. 5a–d). This apparent increase in
other pancreatic cells has been described in other previous studies
of b-cell loss18. Importantly, there were no signs of impaired
b-cell maturation as demonstrated by similar staining for PDX1,
MafA, Pax6 and Glut2 in braKO mice (Supplementary Fig. 6a–d).
Remarkably, b-cell mass is reduced by 80% at 90 days of age, and
these changes were accompanied by reduced cell size measured by
b-catenin/insulin double staining decreased (Fig. 1h,i and
Supplementary Fig. 7). Thus, mTORC1 is necessary for the
maintenance of postnatal b-cell mass by controlling apoptosis,
b-cell size and proliferation.
mTORC1 inactivation in mature b-cells impairs secretion. The
results obtained with the braKO mice indicate that mTORC1 is
critical to maintenance of postnatal b-cell mass. To dissociate the
developmental and postnatal role of mTORC1, we generated a
mouse with tamoxifen (TMX)-inducible deletion of raptor
(MIP-braKOf/f)
19. Islets from 2-month-old MIP-braKOf/f mice
displayed reduced levels of Raptor, p-S6 and p-4E-BP1 at 2 weeks
post TMX injection (Supplementary Fig. 8a). Similar to braKO
mice, MIP-braKOf/f mice exhibited normal weight (28.12±0.966
versus 26.18±0.726 g, n ¼ 9, P ¼ 0.1283) and were
hyperglycaemic and hypoinsulinaemic after 4 and 8 weeks post
TMX injection (Fig. 1j,k). While glucose tolerance was normal
before TMX injection (Fig. 1l), MIP-braKOf/f mice developed
impaired glucose tolerance (Supplementary Fig. 8b and Fig. 1m)
and defective glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in vivo
and in vitro after TMX injection (Fig. 1n,o). Importantly, MIP￾braKOf/f mice injected with corn oil had similar glucose tolerance
to control mice (Supplementary Fig. 8b and Fig. 1m). Similar to
MIP-braKOf/f, islets from 4-week-old braKO mice also exhibited

impaired GSIS (Fig. 1o). Assessment of pancreas morphology
showed that MIP-braKOf/f mice also exhibited increased
apoptosis and decreased cell size (Fig. 1p,q) with no significant
alteration in b-cell mass or proliferation at 8 weeks post TMX
injection (Fig. 1r,s). Interestingly, apoptosis is already triggered in
MIP-braKOf/f mice 2 weeks after TMX as attested by increased
cleaved caspase 3 (Supplementary Fig. 8c). No changes in the
proapoptotic protein BimEL were noted (Supplementary Fig. 8c).
Given the known role of mTORC1 in autophagy and the
connection between autophagy and cell death20,21, we
investigated autophagy in the MIP-braKOf/f mice. These studies
showed that LC3-II was increased, whereas p-ULK was decreased
in MIP-braKOf/f islets at 2 weeks post TMX injection suggesting
the presence of autophagy in this model (Supplementary Fig. 8c).
These studies demonstrate that MIP-braKOf/f and braKO mice
share similar survival, cell size and metabolic phenotypes. Also,
the reduction in insulin secretion with virtually normal b-cell
mass in the MIP-braKOf/f indicates that mTORC1 also controls
insulin secretion per se.
raptor deletion in b-cells induces autophagy. We next investi￾gated the mechanisms responsible for b-cell loss in braKO mice.
Normal levels of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and Bax
suggest that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and proapoptotic
proteins were not involved (Supplementary Fig. 9a–c). Given the
known role of mTORC1 in autophagy, we next decided to
investigate the role of autophagy as a mechanism for b-cell failure
in braKO mice. We observed a greater number of autophagic
vacuoles containing insulin granules, also known as crinophagy22,
in braKO mice compared to controls (Fig. 2a,b). To detect
autophagy in vivo, we crossed control and braKO mice with mice
expressing a molecular marker of autophagy (LC3-GFP)23.
Accumulation of the LC3-GFP protein is highly specific for
autophagosomes and autophagy24. Dispersed b-cells from control
mice showed low cytoplasmic GFP fluorescence (a read-out of
LC3 expression; Fig. 2c). In contrast, cytoplasmic GFP
fluorescence was elevated in the majority of braKO b-cells.
Quantification of b-cells with LC3-GFP puncta formation
confirmed the presence of autophagosome and autophagy in
braKO mice at 40 days of age (Fig. 2c).
Autophagy contributes to the braKO phenotype. Next, we
treated islets of braKO mice with NH4Cl, an inhibitor of autop￾hagy that prevents endosomal acidification and blocks autophagic
flux25. Again, braKO mice showed higher basal levels of LC3-II
than control mice (Fig. 3a). NH4Cl treatment resulted in
accumulation of p62 and LC3-II protein in both braKO and
control mice showing that autophagy was successfully blocked
(Fig. 3a). However, the accumulation was greater in braKO mice,
confirming the increased autophagy flux in these mice (Fig. 3a).
Notably, pharmacological blockage of autophagy by NH4Cl
decreased apoptosis in braKO b-cells (Fig. 3b). Then, we
expanded our studies by in vivo treatment of braKO mice with
two other autophagy inhibitors, chloroquine (CQ) and
3-methyladenine (3MA) starting at 18 days of life. As expected,
there was accumulation of p62 in islets from 3MA- and
CQ-treated groups providing evidence that autophagy was
inhibited by the treatment (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 10).
CQ- and 3MA-treated braKO mice improved glucose levels
during the first 60 days of life (Fig. 3d,e). In addition, 3MA
treatment doubles the b-cell mass in braKO mice restoring b-cell
mass to B70–75% of control mice (Fig. 3f), as a result of
increased b-cell proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis
(Fig. 3g,h). On the other hand, insulin secretion in islets from
braKO mice was not improved after inhibition of autophagy
(Fig. 3i).
Gain of S6K and 4E-BP2 signalling improves glucose levels.
The previous studies showed that mTORC1 is important for the
maintenance of postnatal b-cell mass. We next designed experi￾ments to assess contribution of mTORC1 downstream targets to
regulation of b-cell mass, survival and function. We selectively
restored S6K pathway in braKO mice by crossing with a mouse
model with gain of function of S6K (caS6K) (braKO;caS6K).
Increased p-S6 immunostaining in islets from these mice
demonstrated that S6K activity was augmented (Supplementary
Fig. 11). Published data show that activation of S6K signalling by
overexpressing an active S6K-mutant in b-cells improves b-cell
function but not mass26. Reconstitution of eIF4E activity was
obtained by crossing braKO with mice with global inactivation of
eIF4E inhibitors 4E-BP1 or 4E-BP2 (braKO;Eif4ebp1  /  and
braKO;Eif4ebp2  /  , respectively). 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 are
expressed in islets, and deletion of either does not result in a
compensatory increase in the level of the other protein27. As
previously described, examination of glucose homeostasis in
Eif4ebp1  /  demonstrated improved glucose clearance, and this
phenotype resulted from enhanced insulin sensitivity28. In
contrast to Eif4ebp1  /  mice, no alterations in insulin
sensitivity were observed in Eif4ebp2  /  mice27. We recently
showed that Eif4ebp2  /  and not Eif4ebp1  /  mice exhibit
improved glucose homeostasis by increase in b-cell mass and
proliferation27. Assessment of glucose levels in these genetic
models showed that hyperglycaemia measured by random fed
blood glucose was partially rescued by restoration of 4EBP2/
eIF4E or S6k signalling in braKO mice, but not by 4EBP1/eIF4E
(Fig. 4a,b). Remarkably, reactivation of 4E-BP2/eIF4E
together with S6K signalling was sufficient to maintain
normoglycaemia for the first 60 days (Fig. 4b). After that,
braKO;caS6K;Eif4ebp2  /  mice exhibited a gradual increase in
glucose levels albeit still better than reconstitution of either
pathways alone (Fig. 4a,b). Therefore, it is noteworthy that
hyperglycaemia in braKO mice was not fully rescued by any of
the genetic reconstitution models. The improvement in glucose
was not explained by alterations in insulin sensitivity (Fig. 4c). In
contrast to fed glucose levels, re-establishing mTORC1 signalling
through 4EBP1/eIF4E, 4EBP2/eIF4E and/or S6K normalized
glucose levels after 16 h fasting (Fig. 4d).
Contribution of different mTORC1 targets to b-cell mass.
Analysis of b-cell mass at 5 months showed that reconstitution of
S6K activity, 4EBP1/eIF4E or 4E-BP2/eIF4E signalling increased
b-cell mass in braKO mice (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 12).
However, b-cell mass in braKO;caS6K and braKO;Eif4ebp2  / 
was higher than that observed in braKO;Eif4ebp1  /  mice
(Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 12). Surprisingly, restoration of
S6K together with 4E-BP2/eIF4E signalling was sufficient to
normalize b-cell mass but not hyperglycaemia (Fig. 4b,e).
Assessment of components that contribute to b-cell mass showed
that b-cell proliferation was rescued only in genetic models with
4E-BP2 deletion (Fig. 4f). On the other hand, S6K activation
rescues primarily b-cell apoptosis and size (Fig. 4g,h). The levels
of LC3-II were restored to normal in braKO;caS6K and
braKO;caS6K;Eif4ebp2  /  mice (Supplementary Fig. 13a). Sur￾prisingly, this effect was not mediated by ULK phosphorylation
since no changes were observed in islets of caS6K (101.5±9.611
versus 80.9±15.53 p-ULK/total ULK, n ¼ 4, P ¼ 0.3143). To
explore the mechanisms linking S6K activity and autophagy, we
focused on previous evidence showing that mTORC1/S6K sig￾nalling inhibits autophagosome formation by increasing the

antiapoptotic protein FLIPL (refs 23,24). Indeed, overactivation of
S6K induces FLIPL protein expression in islets (Supplementary
Fig. 13b). In summary, we report that restoring 4E-BP2/eIF4E
and S6K, but not 4E-BP1/eIF4E, has similar effects in improving
fed glucose levels and b-cell mass in mice with inactivation of
mTORC1 in b-cells. However, while 4E-BP2/eIF4E signalling is
critical for b-cell proliferation downstream of mTORC1, S6K
pathway controls cell size and apoptosis as well as regulation of
autophagy.
mTORC1 regulates insulin processing through 4E-BP2/eIF4E.
The previous results indicate that activation of S6K and 4E-BP2/
eIF4E signalling in braKO mice rescued the b-cell mass pheno￾type but failed to completely normalize fed glucose levels
(Fig. 4a,b,e). To explore this further, we decided to assess the
contribution of insulin processing by measuring insulin and
proinsulin levels in all genetic mouse models. Circulating levels of
proinsulin and proinsulin/insulin ratio were higher in braKO
mice (Fig. 5a,c) strengthening the hypothesis that mTORC1
regulates insulin processing. A defect in insulin processing was
confirmed by elevated immunostaining for proinsulin con￾comitantly with decreased insulin staining in b-cells of braKO
mice before the onset of hyperglycaemia (30 days of age; Fig. 5d).
Lower insulin content was further confirmed in single b-cells by
flow cytometry (Fig. 5e). Similar to braKO, MIP-braKOf/f mice
also displayed higher levels of proinsulin further supporting the
role of mTORC1 in insulin processing (Fig. 5f). Interestingly,
concomitant activation of 4E-BP2/eIF4E and S6K pathways in
braKO mice rescued serum insulin levels but only 4E-BP2/eIF4E
signalling restored proinsulin levels and proinsulin/insulin ratio
(Fig. 5a–c). In isolated islets, the proinsulin/insulin ratio was
normalized in the braKO;Eif4ebp2  /  , but not in the
braKO;caS6K;Eif4ebp2  /  mice (Fig. 5g and Supplementary
Fig. 14a), suggesting that S6K overactivation neutralizes the
beneficial effect of 4E-BP2/eIF4E activation on proinsulin
processing.

S6K and 4E-BP2 converge on insulin signalling to regulate CPE.
To understand how mTORC1 controls insulin processing, we first
assessed CPE levels in braKO mice and reconstitution models. CPE
expression was reduced in islets from braKO, and control mice
treated with the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin (Fig. 6a,b and
Supplementary Fig. 14b,c). CPE was rescued by activation of 4E￾BP2/eIF4E pathway in the braKO mice but blunted when over￾activation of S6K was present (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Fig. 15).
In fact, islets from caS6K mice (expressing a rapamycin-resistant
mutant26) exhibited reduced levels of CPE with or without

rapamycin treatment (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Fig. 14c). These
results further support the crosstalk between S6K overactivation
and 4E-BP2/eIF4E pathway on insulin processing. Recent studies
demonstrated that CPE levels are controlled by an insulin/PDX1/
eIF4G axis29. Knowing that S6K activation reduces insulin
signalling by decreasing IRS1/2 levels26 we hypothesized that S6K
overactivation could lower CPE translation by a decrease in this
previously described axis. To assess this, we evaluated the upstream
components responsible for regulation of eIF4G levels by assessing
the IRS2/PDX1/eIF4G1 axis in Eif4bp2 / , caS6K and
caS6K;Eif4bp2 / mice. First, we observed that IRS2 and PDX1
protein levels were diminished in the caS6K mice25 (Fig. 6c),
contrasting to the previously described higher levels in Eif4bp2 /
mice27 (Fig. 6c). Interestingly, IRS2 and PDX1 were also reduced in
the double-mutant caS6K;Eif4bp2 /  indicating that S6K
overexpression neutralizes 4E-BP2 deletion effects on these
proteins (Fig. 6c). Consistently, eIF4G protein levels were
decreased in the braKO;caS6K;Eif4ebp2 / mice but normal in
the braKO;Eif4ebp2 / (Fig. 6c) indicating that abnormalities in
proinsulin processing in braKO;caS6K;Eif4ebp2 / mice were
caused by reduced eIF4G and CPE levels. Finally, given the known
role of CPE in b-cell apoptosis, we reconstituted CPE levels in MIP￾braKOf/f islets (4 weeks after TMX injection) by transduction with
control or CPE-GFP adenoviruses (Ad. CPE-GFPþ ). Proinsulin
levels were reduced in MIP-braKOf/f GFPþ b-cells but
reconstitution of CPE failed to rescue apoptosis in MIP-braKOf/f
GFPþ cells indicating that apoptosis was not directly caused by a
reduction in CPE (Supplementary Fig. 16a–c).
Assessment of other hormone convertases critical for insulin
processing30–34 revealed that PC1/3 was reduced by 20% in braKO
mice and the levels were not rescued in braKO;Eif4ebp2 / or
braKO;caS6K;Eif4ebp2 /  (Supplementary Fig. 17a). PC2 levels
were unchanged in the different experimental groups
(Supplementary Fig. 17a). Rapamycin treatment of MIN6 cells
decreased CPE but did not change PC1/3 levels (Supplementary
Fig. 17b). Finally, MIN6 cells with stable silencing of 4E-BP2
(sh4ebp2) exhibited a 75% reduction in 4E-BP2 (Po0.05, n¼ 4)
and a twofold rise in CPE protein levels (Fig. 7a and Supplementary
Fig. 18). However, CPE mRNA levels in sh4ebp2 cells (Fig. 7b) were
unchanged, suggesting that the rise in CPE was post-transcriptional.
4E-BP2 regulates CPE levels by controlling mRNA translation.
The finding that CPE protein but not mRNA is regulated by
mTORC1/4E-BP2/eIF4E pathway prompted us to investigate cap￾dependent translation mechanisms. Removal of 4E-BP2 releases
eIF4E, allowing eIF4E to interact with eIF4G and assembly of the
eIF4F complex, resulting in enhanced cap-dependent translation35.
The eIF4G:eIF4E interaction is important to drive translation of a
subset of mRNAs with complex secondary structure in the 50
-UTR
(characterized by high guanine cytosine (GC) content and
thermodynamically stable structures (low DG))36. Indeed, a
complex secondary structure of the CPE 50
-UTR was supported by
a more G/C rich (%GC 71.4) than average (actin) and lower free
energy (DG:  33.40 kcal mol 1), suggesting that this mRNA could
be favourably translated by eIF4E (Supplementary Fig. 19)37. To test
this hypothesis, we used 4E1RCat, an inhibitor of cap-dependent
translation that prevents eIF4G:eIF4E interaction. Interestingly,
4E1RCat slightly reduced CPE levels in control cells (shCtrl) and
dampened the increase in CPE levels observed in sh4ebp2 MIN6 cells
(Fig. 7a). Examination of the polyribosome profile showed that
sh4ebp2 MIN6 cells displayed an increase in the fraction of RNAs
associated with polyribosomes (Fig. 7c, red line). Also, CPE mRNA
levels in polyribosomal fractions were significantly increased in the
polyribosomal fractions from sh4ebp2 MIN6 cells, evidencing that
silencing 4E-BP2 enhances CPE translation (Fig. 7d). Interestingly,
inhibition of eIF4E:eIF4G-dependent translation in AtT20 cells (a
pituitary cell line that expresses CPE and proopiomelanocortin
(POMC)) resulted in decreased CPE levels (Fig. 7e). Also, 4E1RCat
treatment resulted in accumulation of POMC and a decrease in
melanocortin (aMSH) levels, pointing to an impaired POMC
processing and suggesting that this mechanism is not limited to b￾cells (Fig. 7f). Therefore, we provide evidence supporting that the
mTORC1/4E-BP2/eIF4E pathway regulates CPE protein level by
increasing mRNA translation.
Rapamycin recapitulates changes in insulin processing. To
confirm that inhibition of mTORC1 in vivo by rapamycin treat￾ment recapitulates the defects in insulin processing observed in
braKO mice, we measured proinsulin in control mice treated with
rapamycin intraperitoneally. Rapamycin treatment for 1 week
was sufficient to increase proinsulin levels and alter proinsulin/
insulin ratio in plasma and islets from control mice (Fig. 8a–c).
More importantly, rapamycin treatment failed to increase plasma
proinsulin levels, proinsulin/insulin ratio and proinsulin content
in islets from Eif4ebp2  /  mice (Fig. 8a–c and Supplementary
Fig. 20a). In addition, rapamycin reduced CPE expression in
control islets but not in islets from Eif4ebp2  /  mice (Fig. 8d
and Supplementary Fig. 20b). Finally, treatment of human islets
with rapamycin for 48 h was sufficient to decrease CPE protein
levels (Fig. 8e,f and Supplementary Fig. 20c). We were unable to
show alterations in proinsulin:insulin ratio after prolonged
treatment with rapamycin, as this was associated with significant
toxicity. Disrupting eIF4E:eIF4G complex by 4E1RCat treatment
also reduced CPE levels in human islets (Fig. 8g and
Supplementary Fig. 20d). Thus, the experiments performed in
human islets recapitulates the defects CPE protein expression.
Discussion
Here we provide the first in vivo genetic dissection of mTORC1
signalling in insulin-sensitive tissues. These studies provide novel
insights into how this pathway regulates different biological

processes in b-cells. We show that raptor inactivation in b-cells
causes b-cell failure and genetic reconstitution of downstream
components in these mice determined the contribution of
different mTORC1 targets to b-cell loss in these mice. The
genetic reconstitution studies in braKO mice demonstrated that
downstream of mTORC1 (Supplementary Fig. 21a) (1) ULK1 and
S6K axis control b-cell survival, (2) S6K mediates the effects on
b-cell size and (3) 4E-BP2/eIF4E (and not 4E-BP1) induces b-cell
proliferation. The studies herein also identified a novel mechan￾ism for mTORC1-dependent translational control of insulin

MIP-braKOf/f mice was maintained after 8 weeks of TMX
suggesting that Raptor plays more important roles in early stages
of postnatal development and b-cell maturation. The lack of
changes in b-cell mass in MIP-braKOf/f mice allowed us to
identify an important role of mTORC1 on insulin secretion, and
preliminary studies showed that MIP-braKOf/f mice exhibit
reduced intracellular calcium after glucose stimulation (unpub￾lished data). This suggests that events proximal to calcium influx
are involved but it is possible that other steps contribute to this
phenotype. The use of MIP-CreERT mice has some limitations
due to the expression of the human growth hormone (hGH)
minigene. While we cannot completely exclude the possibility
that hGH expression from the MIP-CreERT transgene amelio￾rates the loss of b-cell mass in MIP-braKOf/f mice, we believe that
it is unlikely that hGH expression contributes to the alterations in
glucose tolerance as MIP-braKOf/f mice injected with corn oil
exhibited normal glucose tolerance. The partial restoration of
b-cell mass and TUNEL in braKO mice treated with autophagy
inhibitors suggests that autophagy plays a role in the loss of
b-cells (Fig. 3b,f,h). Further experiments crossing braKO mice
with genetic models of decreased autophagy could be performed
to test this hypothesis.
The braKO model showed that chronic autophagy is
detrimental for b-cells. These results are in marked contrast with
published experiments showing that induction of autophagy by
rapamycin treatment improved diabetes, increased pancreatic
insulin content and prevented b-cell apoptosis in Akita mice
implying that increased autophagy is beneficial in this model of
ER stress induced by misfolded insulin38,39. The divergence in
survival outcomes in these two models of autophagy is unclear

but it is possible that the induction of autophagy by different
mechanisms could play a role (mutant insulin/ER stress versus
genetic starvation by inactivation of mTORC1). In addition, it is
unlikely that rapamycin treatment replicates all the biological
effects of raptor deletion. Finally, other published data have
demonstrated that inhibition of autophagy in Atg7  /  mice
results in maintaining the structure, mass and function of
pancreatic b-cells40,41. Taken together, these data support the
concept that optimal levels of autophagy are essential for proper
b-cell function and those conditions of extreme upregulation or
inhibition of autophagy can negatively impact on b-cells mass.
Our studies showed that raptor inactivation exhibits increased
canonical macroautophagy. This was supported by reduced ULK1
phosphorylation, increases in p62 staining and augmented puncta
and LC3-II levels in the basal state (Supplementary Fig. 8c, and
Figs 2c and 3c). In addition, higher p62 staining and LC3-II levels
after inhibition of autophagy in braKO mice is consistent with the
increase in autophagy flux as described42. We also found that
secretory granules are massively delivered for lysosomal
degradation by electron microscopy. However, we failed to see
evidence of macroautophagy (double-membrane structures) by
electron microscopy at 30 and 60 days of age. There are several
potential explanations for this finding: (1) autophagosome flux is
a very rapid process in b-cells and is rarely detected under steady￾state conditions40; (2) macroautophagy may be less prominent in
b-cells than in other tissues43; and (3) there are major differences
in autophagic vacuoles formation between b-cells and other
organs.
Genetic reconstitution experiments demonstrate that hypergly￾caemia in braKO mice was partially rescued by gain of 4E-BP2/
eiF4E, S6K or both. It is unlikely that enhanced
insulin sensitivity observed in the reconstitution experiments
explain the metabolic differences in braKO, braKO;caS6K,
braKO;Eif4ebp2 / and braKO;caS6K;Eif4ebp2 / groups.
These studies suggest that downstream of mTORC1 (1) 4E-BP2/
eIF4E activation induces b-cell proliferation, (2) 4E-BP2/eIF4E
controls insulin processing by regulating CPE translation, (3)
ULK1-mediated effects in autophagy and survival contribute to the
decrease in b-cell mass in braKO and (4) reconstitution of S6K
activity improves cell size and b-cell survival. The potential effect of
S6K on regulation of b-cell autophagy is interesting, and our
experiments are consistent with a model in which mTORC1/S6K
inhibits autophagy by increasing FLIPL levels and this process
ultimately inhibits autophagy-mediated cell death by binding to
ATG3 and decreasing LC3 (refs 44,45). These results are in marked
contrast with published data showing that phosphorylation of S6K
is considered as pro-autophagy46–48. The effect of S6K in autophagy
is controversial49 but discrepancies in the literature could be
explained in part by the following: (1) different mechanisms and
duration of mTOR inhibition (amino-acid deprivation/rapamycin
versus genetic inactivation and chronic versus acute); (2) our S6K
overactivation model provides a non-physiological state of
permanent S6K activation; and (3) previous work showing that
S6K promotes autophagy was obtained in a model of genetic
deletion of mTOR in flies48. However, in this model mTOR
inactivation disrupts both mTORC1 and mTORC2, and mTORC2/
Akt-FoxO pathway may be also involved in the control of
autophagy50. More studies should be designed to clarify the role
of S6K in autophagy in b-cells and other tissues. The current studies
identified a role for mTORC1 on proinsulin processing due to a
reduction in CPE and PC1/3 levels. Our findings showed that
rescue of the insulin processing defect in braKO mice was achieved
by reconstitution of 4E-BP2/eIF4E signalling. This finding is
consistent with a novel role of mTORC1/4E-BP2/eIF4E axis on
regulation of insulin processing by controlling CPE expression. The
complex secondary structure of the CPE 50
-UTR and the higher
CPE mRNA levels in polyribosomal fractions in sh4ebp2 cells
indicate that 4E-BP2/eIF4E regulates CPE translation, and data
using the 4E1RCat further support this conclusion (Fig. 7a–d).
Interestingly, normalization of insulin processing in
braKO;Eif4ebp2 / disappeared when S6K was concomitantly
overexpressed in braKO;caS6K;Eif4ebp2 / , suggesting that 4E￾BP2 and S6K converge on a common pathway to regulate CPE
translation and that the negative effect of S6K overactivation on
CPE is likely dominant. Published studies and the current
experiments are consistent with a model in which insulin
signalling controls insulin processing and CPE translation by two
parallel pathways that converge on the formation of the translation
initiation complex eIF4E:eIF4G: (1) a previously reported pathway
controlled by insulin signalling IRS1/2/PDX1 that regulates eIF4G
levels (Fig. 6c,d and Supplementary Fig. 21a,b). Our studies showed
that this axis is disrupted by the negative feedback on IRS2
signalling induced by S6K overactivation. (2) A second pathway
mediated by 4E-BP2 controlling the availability of eIF4E to form the
eIF4E:eIF4G complex (Supplementary Fig. 21b). In this model, S6K
overactivation neutralizes the effect of 4E-BP2 on CPE and
proinsulin processing by reducing IRS2/PDX1 and ultimately
eIF4G levels, a limiting partner for the formation of
eIF4EG:eIF4E complex and regulation of CPE translation
(Fig. 6c,d). The interaction between S6K/IRS2/PDX1/eIF4G and
4E-BP2/eIF4E pathways to control insulin processing during
normal states or insulin resistance is unclear but we speculate
prolonged overactivation of mTORC1 in conditions of chronic
overnutrition results in a predominant S6K negative-feedback loop
with decrease in IRS1/2 levels and reduction of IRS/PDX1/eIF4G/
CPE pathway. This could explain the increase in proinsulin
observed in early stages of type 2 diabetes. Finally, our data in mice
and human islets treated with rapamycin indicate that the effect of
mTORC1 on CPE and insulin processing operate in vivo and
further confirm that mTORC1 regulates CPE levels in humans
(Fig. 8e–g). Finally, these studies also showed that PC1/3 levels were
reduced in braKO mice and could play a role in the insulin￾processing defect. How mTORC1 regulates PC1/3 is unclear and
more experiments need to be done to study the role of PC1/3 in
braKO b-cells.
In summary, these results show that b-cell mTORC1 signalling
controls glucose homeostasis by regulating b-cell mass, prolifera￾tion, apoptosis and insulin secretion. These findings also reveal a
novel mechanism for mTORC1 in controlling insulin processing by
regulating CPE translation in a 4E-BP2/eIF4E-dependent manner.
This mechanism of hormone-processing regulation provides a new
mechanism to explain the higher incidence of diabetes after
rapamycin treatment in humans. As such, mTORC1 inhibition
could have implications in the regulation of many biological
processes that require CPE-mediated peptide processing, including
thyroid hormone homeostasis, appetite control and obesity, fertility
and neurodegeneration. Finally, it is possible that modulation of
mTORC1/4E-BP2 axis could provide a useful therapeutic tool to
improve the b-cell in pathological conditions.

Metabolic studies. Blood glucose levels were determined from blood obtained
from the tail vein using ACCU-CHEK II glucometer (Roche). Fasting glucose and
insulin were measured after overnight fasting. Glucose tolerance tests and GSIS
were performed on overnight-fasted animals by injecting glucose intraperitoneally
(2 and 3 mg kg  1, respectively)52. Plasma insulin and proinsulin levels were
determined using a Mouse Ultrasensitive Insulin ELISA kit and Mouse Proinsulin
ELISA kit, respectively (ALPCO Immunoassays).
Preparation and in vivo treatment with different agents. TMX (Sigma) was
dissolved in corn oil (Sigma) to a final concentration of 20 mg ml 1
. raptor deletion in
mature b-cells was obtained by subcutaneous injections of 2 mg of TMX (corn oil in
control mice) every day for 3 consecutive days in 2-month-old control and MIP-Cre
mice. Systemic administration of 3MA (Cayman) was performed by daily intraper￾itoneal injections (15 mg kg 1 in 0.9% saline) into 18-day-old braKO and control
littermates for 8 weeks. For CQ experiments, 18-day-old mice received weekly intra￾peritoneal injections of CQ diphosphate (7 mg kg 1 and dissolved in 0.9% saline;
Sigma) or saline for 8 weeks. For rapamycin (LC Laboratories) treatment in vivo,
rapamycin was dissolved in 100% ethanol and stored at  20 C. Stock solution was
further diluted in an aqueous solution of 5.2% Tween 80 and 5.2% PEG 400 (final
ethanol concentration, 2%). Control and Eif4ebp2 / mice were injected with rapa￾mycin intraperitoneally (2 mg kg 1 body weight) or vehicle (2% ethanol) every other
day for 9 days. Islets from these mice were isolated and immediately lysed after isolation.
Islets studies. After islet isolation52, islets were maintained at 37 C in an
atmosphere containing 20% oxygen and 5% CO2. Insulin secretion from isolated
islets was assessed by static incubation52. Briefly, after overnight culture in RPMI
containing 5 mM glucose and 10% FBS, islets were pre-cultured for 1 h in Krebs–
Ringer medium containing 2 mM glucose. Groups of 10 islets in triplicates were
then incubated in Krebs–Ringer medium containing 2 or 24 mM glucose for 1 h.
Secreted insulin in the supernatant and insulin content was then measured using
Mouse Ultrasensitive Insulin ELISA kit (ALPCO Immunoassays) and normalized
to DNA content. Experiments to assess the inhibition of autophagy in vitro were
performed by culturing islets for 24 h in RPMI containing NH4Cl (20 mM; Sigma)
and 5 mM glucose. For rapamycin treatment in vitro, islets were cultured in RPMI
containing 5 mM glucose and rapamycin (30 nM; Sigma) for 24 or 48 h as indicated
in the corresponding figure legends. Similar culture conditions were used for
experiments with 4E1RCat (25 mm; Sigma), an inhibitor of the interaction between
eIF4E:eIF4G. Human islets were obtained through the Integrated Islet Distribution
Program (Supplementary Table 1).
Western blotting. Islets from an individual mouse (120–150 islets) were lysed in
lysis buffer (125 mM Tris, pH 7, 2% SDS and 1 mM dithiothreitol) containing a
protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics). Protein quantity was measured by
a bicinchoninic acid assay method, and 40 mg of protein were loaded on SDS–
PAGE gels and separated by electrophoresis. Separated proteins were transferred
onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) overnight.
After blocking for 1 h in 1  Tris-buffered saline–1% Tween 20–5% milk, mem￾branes were incubated overnight at 4 C with a primary antibody diluted in 1 
Tris-buffered saline–1% Tween 20–5% milk followed by 1 h incubation at room
temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Anti￾bodies used for immunoblotting are included in Supplementary Table 2, and
membranes were developed using Western Bright Sirius Kit (BioExpress). Band
densitometry was determined by measuring pixel intensity using NIH Image J
software (v1.49d (ref. 53) freely available at http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/index.html)
and normalized to tubulin, actin or total protein in the same membrane. Images
have been cropped for presentation. Full-size images for the most important
western blots are presented in Supplementary Figs.
Adenoviral infection. After overnight culture in RPMI containing 5 mM glucose,
islets were infected with adenoviruses carrying the cytomegalovirus promoter (Ad.
CMV) or CPE and GFP under the control of the CMV promoter (Ad. CPE-GFP
(ADV-256014), Vector BioLabs). The particle:plaque-forming unit ratio of the
stock virus used in the experiments was 300. After 3 days of culture, islets were
dispersed, fixed and stained for CPE, active caspase 3, proinsulin and insulin.
Flow cytometry. After overnight culture in RPMI containing 5 mM glucose, islets
were dispersed into a single-cell suspension and fixed with BD Pharmingen
Transcription Factor Phospho Buffer Set (BD Biosciences). Dispersed cells were
incubated overnight with conjugated antibodies at 4 C. Dead cells were excluded
by Ghost Dye Red 780 (Tonbo), and signal intensity from single stained cells and
GFP was analysed by mean fluorescent intensity in insulin-positive cells using BD
LSR II (BD Biosciences). Antibodies used are included in Supplementary Table 2.
Quantitative real-time PCR. Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy (Qiagen)
followed by cDNA synthesis using High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit
(Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Real-time PCR was
performed on an ABI 7000 sequence detection system using POWER SYBR-Green
PCR Master MIX (Applied Biosystems). Primers were purchased from IDT
Technologies. Primer pair for CPE was as follows: 50
-CGGACAAACCCTTTAA￾CACC-30 (forward); 50
-CCGGAAGAGACTCTCAAAAGC-30 (reverse).
Polyribosomal profiling and gradient fraction quantitative PCR. For poly￾ribosomal profiling studies, sh4ebp2 and control MIN6 cells27 were lysed and
processed on sucrose gradients54. A piston gradient fractionator (BioComp) was used
to measure RNA A254 with an in-line ultraviolet monitor, and gradients were collected
in ten 1 ml fractions. Fractions 1–5 were combined as the monosome pool, and
fractions 6–10 were combined as the polysome pool. The percentage of message
recovered in the monosome and polysome pools was determined for each condition.
mRNA for polysomal and monosomal fraction was isolated as described above.
Immunofluorescence and morphometry. Formalin-fixed pancreatic tissues were
embedded in paraffin using standard techniques. Immunofluorescence staining was
performed using primary antibodies described on Supplementary Table 1. Fluorescent
images were acquired using a microscope (Leica DM5500B) with a motorized stage
using a camera (Leica Microsystems, DFC360FX), interfaced with the OASIS-blue PCI
controller and controlled by the Surveyor software (version 7.1, Objective Imaging Ltd).
b-cell ratio assessment was calculated by measuring insulin and acinar areas using
Image Pro Software (version 7 Media Cybernetics, Inc.) in five insulin-stained sections
(5 mm) that were 200 mm apart. To calculate b-cell mass, b-cell to acinar ratio was then
multiplied by the pancreas weight. Assessment of proliferation was performed in
insulin- and Ki67-stained sections, and included at least 3,000 cells per animal.
Apoptosis was determined using TUNEL assay (ApopTag Red In Situ Apoptosis
Detection Kit, Chemicon) in insulin-stained sections. At least 3,000 b-cells were
counted for each animal. Cell size was determined by immunostaining sections for b￾catenin and measuring the areas of individual b-cells from different experimental
groups using NIH Image J software (v1.49d (ref. 53) freely available at http://
rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/index.html). For dispersed cell staining, islets were gently dispersed
after 5 min incubation with trypsin–EDTA (0.25% trypsin and 1 mM EDTA) in Hanks’
balanced salt solution without Ca2þ and Mg2þ (Gibco Invitrogen) at 37 C followed
by fixation in 4% methanol-free formaldehyde onto poly-L-lysine-coated slides. All the
morphologic measurements were performed in blinded manner.
Electron microscopy. Ultrastructural characterization by transmission electron
microscopy was performed after overnight culture (in RPMI containing 5 mM glucose
at 37 C). Islets were then fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde and then dehydrated and
embedded in Epon by the Microscopy & Image Analysis Laboratory Core
(MiCORES). Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and
images were recorded digitally using a Philips CM-100 electron microscope.
Statistical analysis. The statistical significance of differences between the various
conditions was determined by nonparametric U-test (Mann–Whitney) using Prism
version 6.0d (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Data are presented as mean±-
s.e.m. and were considered statistically significant when the P value was o0.05.
