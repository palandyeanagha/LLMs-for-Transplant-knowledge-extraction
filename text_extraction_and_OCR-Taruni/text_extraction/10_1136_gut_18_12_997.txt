SUMMARY A new antigen-antibody system associated with the hepatitis B virus and immunologically
distinct from the HB surface, core, and e systems is reported. The new antigen, termed 3, was
detected by direct immunofluorescence only in the liver cell nuclei of patients with HBsAg positive
chronic liver disease. At present, the intrahepatic expression of HBcAg and 6 antigen appears to be
mutually exclusive. No ultrastructural aspect corresponding to the antigen could be identified
under the electron microscope. 8 antibody was found in the serum of chronic HBsAg carriers, with a
higher prevalence in patients with liver damage. The nuclear fluorescence patterns of HBcAg and
antigen were similar; it is only possible to discriminate between the two antigens by using the
respective specific antisera.
While studying liver biopsies from patients who
were seropositive for the hepatitis B surface antigen
(HBsAg) in direct immunofluorescence, it was noted
that an antiserum against the hepatitis B core
antigen (HBcAg), as well as staining specimens in
which core particles could be demonstrated by the
electron microscope (EM), also reacted with addi￾tional biopsies which did not contain core particles
(at electron microscopy) and were negative with other
reference antisera against HBcAg.
When the EM core positive and core negative
specimens were tested with several HBsAg positive
sera, it soon became apparent that some sera
reacted with either one or the other liver substrate;
this suggested that there were two distinct nuclear
antigenic specificities.
The identification of this new antigen and of its
antibody as an immunological system independent
of other known reactions associated with the HB
virus is reported in this communication. Provision￾ally, we propose that it should be called 6.

A fluorescein isothyocianate (FITC) conjugated
antiserum against HBsAg was prepared from
Beheringwerke rabbit precipitating serum RBB04
(Rizzetto et al., 1976b). A FITC conjugated anti￾serum against e antigens (e. + ef6) was prepared
from a human serum as previously described (Trepo
etal., 1976).
A FITC antiserum monospecific against HBcAg
and one monospecific against 8 were prepared from
the blood of two apparently healthy HBsAg carriers;
both sera were negative when tested by the Reuma
and Waaler-Rose techniques. The gamma globulin
fractions, isolated after precipitation with (NH4)2SO4,
did not contain autoantibodies (in indirect Immuno￾fluorescence (IFL)), antibodies against HBsAg, e
antigens, or e antibodies.
After conjugation with FITC, the HBc antiserum

reacted at a titre of 1 in 320 with substrates in which
core particles had been detected by the electron
microscope and with a reference core positive liver
specimen (kindly provided by Dr K. Krawczynsky,
The National Institute of Hygiene, Warsaw, Poland).
FITC conjugated 8 antiserum did not react with
the reference HBcAg positive substrate but gave an
identical nuclear fluorescence pattern on livers from
HBsAg carriers which did not contain core particles
under the electron microscope. Such livers were
considered as 8 specific substrates.
Each antiserum was absorbed with rat, pig, and
human HBsAg negative livers, with immuno￾globulins from an HBsAg negative serum and with
blood cells from individuals of group AB, and tested
in direct IFL against rat liver, kidney, and stomach
and against human surgical and post mortem
specimens of pancreas, thyroid, stomach, colon,
adrenal, ovary, testis, and brain.
To perform IFL screening for HBc and 8 anti￾bodies, a standard HBcAg and a standard 8 positive
liver were obtained at necropsy from two HBsAg
positive patients who died from cirrhosis; several
blocks of each liver were immediately frozen. The
standard HBcAg and 8 substrates were tested in
direct immunofluorescence (DIFL) with HBs,
e, + e,6 and 8 antisera and with a reference HBc
antiserum (kindly provided by Dr K. Krawczynsky),
and in indirect IFL with a HBc chimpanzee anti￾serum (kindly provided by the NIH, Bethesda,
USA).
DEMONSTRATION OF SPECIFICITY OF 6
FLUORESCENCE
To exclude the possibility of anti-IgG reactivity,
the standard antiserum was tested by DIFL with
kidney glomeruli and HBcAg positive liver nuclei
containing bound IgG, demonstrated by mono￾specific FITC anti-human IgG rabbit antisera.
Immunofluorescence, blocking, and absorption
experiments were carried out to assess the specificity
of the 8 reaction. 8 antiserum was tested in DIFL
on substrates containing cytoplasmic HBsAg,
cytoplasmic ef6 and nuclear e, antigens (Trepo et al.,
1976).
In the blocking tests, the standard 8 positive
substrate was covered for 30 minutes with high
titre human and chimpanzee HBc antisera, with
human and rabbit HBs antisera, and with human
sera strongly reacting against the e. and the eft
antigens by immunodiffusion (ID), and subsequently
tested in DIFL with the standard 8 antiserum.
Absorption experiments were carried out using
(1) an HB core rich fraction prepared according to
the method of Huang (Huang and Groh, 1973) by
pronase digestion of an HBcAg positive liver well
characterised by IFL and electron microscopy
studies; (2) ea and e # antigen enriched fractions
obtained from human sera as previously reported
(Trepo et al., 1976); (3) anti-human IgG (Behering￾werke TNYO5). These three preparations were able
to abolish (1) HBcAg, (2) ea and e,#, and (3) any
fluorescence when incubated for one hour at 370
and overnight at 4° with the respective antisera. The
standard 8 antiserum, titred to end point, was
incubated (1/5 VV) for one hour at 37° and over￾night at 4° with the above preparations and sub￾sequently tested by DIFL on the standard 6 substrate.
BIOPSY SCREENING FOR HBcAg, HBsAg, IgG

One hundred and thirty-seven liver biopsies were
retrospectively studied: 54 from HBsAg sero￾negative patients with a variety of liver disorders,
and 83 from HBsAg sero-positive patients whose
histological diagnosis is reported in Table 1.

Gastric and rectal biopsies from two patients

Each specimen was tested in direct immuno￾fluorescence for the presence of the 8 antigen,
HBcAg, and HBsAg with the respective mono￾specific fluorescent antisera, for the presence of
immunoglobulins deposits with antihuman IgG,
A, M commercial antisera (Behering-Hoechst), and
for the capacity to fix C in vitro, as previously
described (Rizzetto et al., 1976a).
To study the relationship between 8 or HBcAg
positive hepatocytes and those positive for IgG or
VCF, serial sections were stained alternatively with
the 8 or HBc FITC conjugated antisera and with

HBsAg and HBsAb were detected in radioimmuno￾assay (by courtesy of Dr Peyretti, The Blood
Bank, Turin).
As circulating 8 was never found by ID in the
serum of patients with and without 8 in their livers,
8 antibody had to be detected by IFL; because of
intrinsic IgG background fluorescence in the standard
substrate, only direct immunofluorescence could be
used. With this method the frequency of anti-6 was
assessed in the sera of 60 patients, whose immuno￾logical and clinical features are reported in Table 2.

Aliquots of the gamma globulin fractions of the
sera under study were left overnight dialysing in a
bath containing FITC 01 mg/ml in carbonate
bicarbonate buffer pH 9, dialysed thereafter against
phosphate buffered saline for 48 hours, absorbed
with rat and human HBsAg negative liver powders,
and tested in direct IFL for anti-8 and HBcAb on
the positive standard substrates. Parallel indirect
IFL tests for HBcAb were carried out with 1/10
diluted sera on the reference HBcAg positive
substrate, which did not exhibit any background
intrinsic IgG fluorescence.
e and anti-e were detected in double immuno￾diffusion in agarose (Magnius and Espmark, 1972)
against standard anti-e and e.
ELECTRON MICROSCOPY
The standard HBcAg and 8 positive livers and four
biopsies positive for 8 in IFL were studied with the
electron microscope.
Some samples from each biopsy were fixed for
two hours in 3 % buffered glutaraldehyde, postfixed
for two hours in 1% osmium tetroxide and then
dehydrated with ethanol and embedded in
Araldite (Durcupan ACM Fluka); other samples
were fixed for one hour in 40% phosphate buffered
paraformaldehyde, prepared according to Karnow￾sky (Karnowsky, 1965), dehydrated with acetone,
and embedded in Araldite or Epon-Araldite. Post￾fixation with osmium was omitted after paraform￾aldehyde fixation. Ultra-thin sections from the fixed
blocks were stained with uranil acetate and lead
citrate.
To localise 8 positive nuclei, electron microscopy
was carried out on ultra-thin sections serial to
semi-thin ones stained in IFL with 8 anti-serum
(Canese and Bussolati, 1974).
Results
SPECIFICITY OF 8 ANTIGEN-ANTIBODY
SYSTEM
8 antiserum stained only liver biopsies from HBsAg
seropositive patients (Table 1); 54 liver specimens
from HBsAg seronegative subjects, rectal and gastric
biopsies from two patients with a positive 8 reaction
in their livers, and all the animal and human sub￾strates that were tested were negative.
Fluorescence was always limited to the nuclei of
the hepatocytes, the proportion of positive cells
varying from a few to over 8000 in the section. The
staining usually appeared to be diffuse and reticular,
and was only occasionally granular with brighter
areas at the periphery of the nuclei; nucleoli
remained unstained (Figure). Liver cell cytoplasms
and Kuppfer cells never stained.
Monospecific human and animal antisera against
HBsAg, HBcAg, and e (ex + e,f) did not stain the
nuclei of any 8 positive specimen, while anti-8 never
stained HBcAg positive biopsies, either one or the
other determinant being expressed in the liver.
Fluorescence was not blocked by previous in￾cubation of the 8 positive substrate with HBs, HBc,
ex + e3 anti-sera, or abolished after absorption of
8 antiserum with fractions containing ea,, e,g and
core particles in high concentrations; conversely,
it was completely abolished after absorption with
antihuman IgG serum.

PREVALENCE OF NUCLEAR FLUORESCENCE
IN HBsAg CARRIERS: HISTOLOGICAL AND
IMMUNOLOGICAL FEATURES OF PATIENTS
WITH 8 POSITIVE BIOPSIES
The incidence of 8 and HBcAg nuclear fluorescence
in 83 HBsAg carriers is reported in Table 1.
8 positive nuclei were observed in 13 patients with
chronic liver disease; their histological diagnosis
varied from a chronic persistent hepatitis to an
inactive cirrhosis (Table 3).
Five patients were being treated with steroids or
azathioprine at the time of the biopsy; in four
treatment had been discontinued one to six months
previously, while four had never received immuno￾suLppressive therapy. The highest number of 8
positive nuclei was observed in the immunosuppressed
patients, the lowest in those who had never been so
treated.
Scattered cytoplasmic HBsAg was observed in
four biopsies, e antigen was found in the serum of
five out of 11 patients with 8 in their liver, anti-e in
none of them.
Biopsies were negative from patients with acute
type B viral hepatitis or from chronic HBsAg
carriers with normal livers.
INCIDENCE OF 8 ANTIBODIES IN PATIENTS
WITH AND WITHOUT SEROLOGICAL EVIDENCE
OF HB VIRUS EXPOSURE
The occurrence of anti-8 and HBcAb in patients
with and without serological evidence of contact with
the HB virus is reported in Table 2.
Two asymptomatic HBsAg chronic carriers and
six HBsAg positive patients with chronic liver
disease had circulating anti-8; three patients in the
latter group had 8 in their livers (nos. 2, 3, 7, Table 3)
and one of the asymptomatic carriers also had
HBcAb in his serum.
Discussion
A new antigen-antibody system, distinct from the
HBs, HBc, and e systems and called 8, is present in
the liver and in the blood of HBsAg carriers.
8 antigen was identified by chance, after the obser￾vation that an HBcAb positive serum gave a nuclear
staining reaction with HBsAg positive specimens
in which no core particles could be seen after
extensive ultrastructural search.
The new antigen is specific for HB virus infection
and was localised in IFL only in the liver cell nuclei
of patients with chronic HBsAg seropositive liver
disease; patients with HBsAg seronegative disorders,
asymptomatic chronic carriers, and those with acute
self-limited hepatitis were constantly negative.
Immunofluorescence with antisera against the
different HB virus determinants and blocking and
absorption experiments demonstrated the specificity
and independence of the new antigen. Monospecific
HBc and HBs antisera did not stain the nuclei of 8
positive substrates, only HBsAg cytoplasmic fluores￾cence occurring occasionally in these biopsies, while,
conversely, 8 antiserum never stained HBcAg
positive substrates. This suggested mutual exclusion
of the intrahepatic expression of the 8 and core
determinants.
HBsAg positive sera containing precipitating
antibodies to ea and eA did not stain 8 positive
substrates, thus demonstrating that the new antigen
was also independent of e; this was further confirmed
by absorption and blocking experiments with
partially purified ea and efi antigens and antibodies.
No morphological counterpart of the new antigen
could be identified by electron microscopy, only
granular chromatin clumps being visualised in thin
sections serial to others in which corresponding
nuclei containing 6 could be identified with certainty
in IFL.
Material reacting immunologically as human IgG
and fixing complement was present in the hepatocytes
containing the 8 antigen; whether it represents
circulating immunoglobulins which entered the cell
and formed immune complexes or an intrinsic
property of a strong anticomplementary antigen is at
present uncertain.
A type of nuclear staining and an IFL distribution
pattern similar to the 8 and identical IgG and C
fixing reactions are known to occur (Arnold et al.,
1975; Gerber et al., 1976; Rizzetto et al., 1976a) and
were observed in this study in the HBcAg positive
biopsies; morphological differentiation of the two
antigens is therefore impossible, their recognition
being permitted only by the knowledge of the
specificity of the challenging antiserum.
As 8 antibodies may be present or absent in sera
containing HBcAb, screening of liver specimens for
the core determinant with HBcAb positive sera has
either missed the new reactivity or confused it with
HBcAg. We have previously reported strong IgG
reactions and C fixing capacity in some biopsies
which did not stain with HBc antiserum and
explained this as masking of HBc reactive sites by
complexed IgG antibodies (Rizzetto et al., 1976a);
subsequent testing of these specimens with 8 anti￾serum has shown a positive nuclear reaction,

demonstrating that previous negative results after
HBc antiserum represented genuine absence of the
core antigen, the IgG and C fixing reactions prob￾ably being caused by the hitherto unknown 8
antigen.
Recently, the ea antigen has also been localised
in the liver cell nuclei of HBsAg seropositive subjects
(Trepo et al., 1976), adding further difficulties in the
interpretation of immunofluorescence; HBcAb and
anti-e occur often together, and although anti-e
was never found together with anti-8 in this study,
the limited number of sera tested does not allow us
to exclude with certainty the possibility that they
may occasionally be associated.
A retrospective survey of 137 biopsies with mono￾specific antisera revealed an incidence of 8 similar
to that of HBcAg.
An overlap was also observed between the
histological and immunological features of 8 positive
subjects and those reported in HBcAg positive
patients (Gudat et al., 1975; Arnold et al., 1976;
Bonino et al., 1976; Ray et al., 1976); a chronic
lesion was always observed by histology in their
livers, only e, not anti-e, being present in 45% of
their sera.
The majority were, or had been, receiving immuno￾suppressive therapy and fluorescence was strongest
in individuals still under treatment; the significance
of this association is at present uncertain.
The incidence of anti-8 could be assessed only in
a limited number of patients. Indirect IFL proved
impossible for the intrinsic background IgG reaction
observed in all the positive substrates with enough
material available, and attempts to destroy selectively
the IgG reaction by fixatives were unsuccessful, the
antigen site being also denatured.
Sera were to be tested in direct IFL after con￾jugation with FITC, a time-consuming procedure
which did not allow a large-scale study of the
antibody distribution.
Anti-8 was found only in HBsAg positive sera,
with a highest incidence in patients with liver
disease; an inverse correlation was noted between
its titre and that of HBcAb, one antibody usually
excluding the other.
Anti-8 was found in several patients with the 8
antigen in their liver; in analogy with the HB core
system, anti-8 does not imply clearance of the
antigen nor resolution of infection and might
represent another serological marker of a stage of
viral replication different from that identified by
HBc antibodies (Hoofnagle et al., 1973).
The nature of the new antigen is obscure; its
occurrence in the same type of disorders in which
HBcAg is detected and the reputation of the Dane
particle as the HB virus unit capable of inducing
the lesion observed in 8 positive patients (Nielsen
et al., 1973) suggest that the antigen is closely related
to the core particle or to the chain of events preceding
its assembly or after its clearance. DNA polymerase,
circular DNA molecule, and DNA polymerase
product are tentative candidates; each of them,
however, has been located only inside a mature core
envelope (Robinson, 1976), while to be the 8
antigen they should exist free and uncovered in the
nucleoplasm. Whether this is the case or whether
the new antigen is unrelated to any of the known HB
virus components is at present under study.
