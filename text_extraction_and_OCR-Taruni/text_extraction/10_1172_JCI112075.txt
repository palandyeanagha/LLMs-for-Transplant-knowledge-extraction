Abstract
The utility of freshly isolated suspensions of rabbit tubules en￾riched in proximal segments for studying the pathogenesis of
oxygen deprivation-induced renal tubular cell injury was evalu￾ated. Oxygenated control preparations exhibited very good sta￾bility of critical cell injury-related metabolic parameters including
oxygen consumption, cell cation homeostasis, and adenine nu￾cleotide metabolism for periods in excess of 2 h. Highly repro￾ducible models of oxygen deprivation-induced injury and recovery
were developed and alterations of injury-related metabolic pa￾rameters in these models were characterized in detail. When
oxygen deprivation was produced under hypoxic conditions, tu￾bules sustained widespread lethal cell injury and associated met￾abolic alterations within 15-30 min. However, when oxygen de￾privation was produced under simulated ischemic conditions, tu￾bules tolerated 30-60 min with only moderate amounts of lethal
cell injury occurring, a situation similar to that seen with ischemia
in vivo. Like ischemia in vivo, simulated ischemia in vitro was
characterized by a fall in pH during oxygen deprivation. No such
fall in pH occurred in the hypoxic model. To test whether this
fall in pH could contribute to the protection seen during simulated
ischemia in vitro, tubules were subjected to hypoxia at medium
pHs ranging from 7.45 to 6.41. Striking protection from hypoxic
injury was seen as pH was reduced with maximal protection
occurring in tubules made hypoxic at pHs below 7.0. Measure￾ments of injury-associated metabolic parameters suggested that
the protective effect of reduced pH may be mediated by pH￾induced alterations of tubule cell Ca++ metabolism. This study
has, thus, defined and characterized in detail a new and extremely
versatile model system for the study of oxygen deprivation-in￾duced cell injury in the kidney and has established that pH al￾terations play a major role in modulating such injury.
effects of such injury on nephronal function and renal hemo￾dynamics, and the effects of these factors on renal tubular cell
viability and functional integrity (1, 2). Although patterns of
injury differ somewhat between animal models and human
ischemic acute renal failure (3, 4), tubular cell injury appears to
be a common and necessary event for ischemic acute renal failure
in each of these settings, and increasing interest has focused on
its pathogenesis over the past several years. Furthermore, a va￾riety of protective maneuvers with apparent efficacy to ameliorate
renal tubular cell injury and the associated acute renal failure
including treatment with osmotic agents, calcium channel
blockers, and adenine nucleotides have been reported (5-7).
However, the structural heterogeneity of the kidney and the re￾ciprocal interactions between tubular cell injury and nephronal
and hemodynamic processes occurring in vivo have limited in￾formation about pathogenetic mechanisms oftubular cell injury
and protection from it that can be obtained from studies in vivo.
Isolated tubule preparations studied both as individually perfused
tubules and tubule suspensions have provided substantial insights
into the normal physiology of the renal tubular epithelium (8-
10). Freshly isolated intact cell preparations have been applied
to the study of cell injury in a number of tissues including, to a
limited extent, the kidney ( 1 1-16). The present study establishes
freshly isolated suspensions of rabbit tubules enriched in prox￾imal segments as a highly versatile system for studying the effects
of oxygen deprivation on critical metabolic parameters involved
in the pathogenesis of renal tubule cell injury, identifies major
differences in the susceptibility of tubules to such injury as a
function of whether oxygen deprivation is produced under hy￾poxic or under simulated ischemic conditions, and implicates
pH as a major factor contributing to the differences between
hypoxic and ischemic injury.

Animals. Female New Zealand White rabbits (Langshaw Farms, Augusta,
MI) weighing an average of 2.5 kg were used for these studies.
Tubule isolation. Rabbits were anesthetized by injection of 25 mg/
kg sodium thiamylal into an ear vein. The abdominal cavity was opened,
and both kidneys were rapidly removed and were immediately placed
in an ice-cold solution containing 115 mM NaCI, 2.1 mM KCI, 25 mM
NaHCO3, 2.4 mM KH2PO4, 1.2 mM CaCI2, and 2.5 mM MgS04 pre￾viously gassed with and kept under 95% 02/5% CO2 (solution A). The
rabbit was then killed with an overdose of thiamylal. The renal cortices
were dissected on an ice-cold tile and were minced into small slices with
a razor blade. The entire cortex from one rabbit was then placed into
24 ml of a solution with an electrolyte concentration identical to solution
A except for a CaCl2 concentration of 2.5 mM, a phosphate concentration
of 1.2 mM, and the addition of 25 mM mannitol, 2.5 mg/ml fatty acid￾free bovine serum albumin (Miles Laboratories, Inc., Elkhart, IN), 5
mM glucose, 4 mM sodium lactate, I mM alanine, 1 mM sodium bu￾tyrate, and 24 mg ofcollagenase (Type I, Worthington Biochemical Corp.,
Freehold, NJ) in a siliconized 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask. The flask was
gassed with 95% 02/5% C02, sealed, and placed in shaking water bath
at 37°C. The flask was gently shaken for 30-50 min depending on the
activity of the particular lot of collagenase being used.

At the end of the collagenase treatment period, the flask was removed
from the water bath and opened and 75 ml of ice-cold solution A was
added. The suspension was then filtered through a strainer to remove
any remaining pieces of tissue. The filtrate was then centrifuged in a 50-
ml tube in a refrigerated centrifuge at 4VC for 2 min at 30 g to separate
a pellet of intact tubules and glomeruli from lighter subcellular debris
that remained largely in the supernatant. The tubule pellet was gently
resuspended in fresh solution A and recentrifuged. This pellet was then
resuspended in 10 ml of fresh solution A containing 5% fatty acid-free
bovine serum albumin and centrifuged again. The resulting pellet was
resuspended in 35 ml of solution A containing 50% Percoll (Pharmacia
Fine Chemicals, Piscataway, NJ), and the suspension was centrifuged
for 30 min at 37,000 g in a DuPont-Sorvall RC-5 centrifuge (DuPont
Instruments, Sorvall Biomedical Div., Newtown, CT). The resulting gra￾dient effectively separated lighter glomeruli and distal tubular segments
from more dense proximal tubule segments (17). The layer enriched in
proximal tubule segments was removed from the gradient with a Pasteur
pipette and washed twice with solution A to remove the Percoll, yielding
mostly short lengths of proximal tubules.
Basic procedures for study ofthefinal tubule preparation. The final
tubule pellet was resuspended to a concentration of 5-7.5 mg of tubule
protein/ml in a 95% 02/5% CO2 gassed, ice-cold solution of the same
electrolyte composition as solution A with the addition of 0.6% dialyzed
dextran (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals T40) (18), 5 mM glucose, 4 mM
lactate, I mM alanine, and 10 mM butyrate. 4.5-ml aliquots of this
tubule suspension were placed in siliconized 25-ml Erlenmeyer flasks
which were then gassed with 95% 02/5% C02, sealed, and kept on ice
until use. As they were needed for experiments, flasks were placed in a
shaking water bath at 370C and were gently shaken for the desired periods
of warm incubation.
Measurements oftubule respiration. A sample of tubule suspension
was placed in a l.9-ml, sealed, temperature-controlled (370C) chamber
equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a Clark oxygen electrode (Gilson
Medical Electronics, Inc., Middleton, WI), and oxygen consumption
was measured under the following conditions: (a) Basal respiration￾the respiratory rate in the presence of available substrates without any
further additions representing the net result of steady-state energy-re￾quiring processes within the tubules at that point in time; (b) uncoupled
respiration-the stimulated rate of respiration occurring in the presence
of a supramaximal dose of an uncoupler of mitochondrial respiration,
15 IAM carbonyl-cyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCLP)'; this
measures the maximal rate of oxidative metabolism of which the prep￾aration is capable at any given point and can serve as a valuable index
both of the utility of available substrates and of the overall integrity of
mitochondrial electron transport mechanisms within the tubules; (c)
succinate-stimulated uncoupled respiration-the respiratory rate which
follows addition of 5 mM sodium succinate during CCCLP uncoupled
respiration.
Measurement oftubule electrolyte content. For measurement oftotal
tubule cell cation levels, the tubules were rapidly separated from their
suspending medium by gently layering 0.5 ml of tubule suspension into
a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube on 0.7 ml of bromododecane (Aldrich
Chemical Co., Milwaukee, WI), which had previously been layered on
0.2 ml of 275 mM sucrose containing 4% Ficoll (Pharmacia Fine Chem￾icals) to increase its density while maintaining isotonicity. The tube was
then centrifuged in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge for 30 s to pellet the
tubules in the bottom sucrose layer. The original suspending medium
that contained the tubules remained above the bromododecane layer
and was then removed as was the bromododecane. Electrolyte levels of
the tubules in the bottom sucrose-Ficoll layer were measured by atomic
absorption spectroscopy as previously described ( 19).
Measurement oftubule adenine nucleotides. Tubule suspensions were
sampled by two methods to quantify accurately both intracellular and
extracellular adenine nucleotides under various conditions. To measure

total suspension adenine nucleotide levels, 0.4 ml of tubule suspension
was added to an equal volume of 12% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) in a
1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube which was vigorously mixed and then cen￾trifuged. The supernatant was removed from the protein pellet and was
neutralized and extracted by mixing with an equal volume of 0.5 M tri￾n-octylamine (Aldrich Chemical Co.) in Freon-1 13 (Matheson Gas
Products, Inc., East Rutherford, NJ) (20). Separation of the Freon and
aqueous layers was facilitated by a brief centrifugation. Then the aqueous
layer was removed, filtered through 0.45-,um nitrocellulose filters, and
frozen. To determine intracellular nucleotide levels directly and to mea￾sure medium nucleotides, a procedure similar to that utilized for deter￾mination of tubule electrolytes was used. 0.4 ml of 12% TCA in a 1.5-
ml microcentrifuge tube were overlaid with 0.7 ml of bromododecane.
0.4 ml of tubule suspension was gently layered on the bromododecane,
and the tube was immediately centrifuged for 30 s in an Eppendorf
microcentrifuge to rapidly move the tubules into the TCA layer, leaving
the tubule medium as a supernatant. A sample of the supernatant was
immediately added to an equal volume of 12% TCA for determination
of medium nucleotide levels; then the remaining supernatant and bro￾mododecane were discarded. The volume of the bottom TCA layer of
the centrifuge tube was brought up to 0.8 ml with the medium used for
final resuspension of tubules, as described above. This TCA extract was
then mixed again and recentrifuged, and the resulting supernatant was
separated from the protein pellet. Subsequent steps were identical to
those described above for measurement of total suspension nucleotide
levels. Recovery of adenine nucleotides by this method was virtu￾ally 100%.
Adenine nucleotides were quantified by high performance liquid
chromatography at an absorbance of 254 nm with a Whatman Partisil
10 SAX strong anion-exchange column (Whatman Chemical Separations,
Inc., Clifton, NJ) and a gradient elution system (21) utilizing 5 mM
NH4H2PO4, pH 3.0 (buffer A), and 0.5 M NH4H2PO4, pH 4.50 (buffer
B), at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Samples were initially eluted isocratically
with buffer A for 6 min to elute AMP. The percentage of buffer B was
then increased over 30 min to 50% to elute ADP. The percentage of
buffer B was then further increased over 5 min to 100% which was con￾tinued between 35 and 46 min to elute ATP. The column was then
reequilibrated with buffer A for 15 min before injection of the next
sample. Standard curves were generated using pure nucleotides. We have
found that this method combines the reproducibility and ease of use of
purely isocratic elution methods with the ability to measure all the adenine
nucleotides of interest simultaneously on a single sample.
pH measurements. In studies where suspension pHs were measured,
the standard oximeter chamber was replaced by a 2. I-ml temperature￾controlled chamber with ports for both a Clark oxygen electrode and a
pH electrode (S900C, Sensorex, Stanton, CA). For measurements of tu￾bule pellet pH levels, a 6-mm electrode was used (S31 IA, Beckman
Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA).
Preparation and study ofisolated mitochondria. Kidneys were rapidly
removed and placed in ice-cold 275 mM sucrose, and the cortices were
promptly dissected, minced, and homogenized in 275 mM sucrose, I
mM EGTA, 5 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.4. Then mitochondria were separated
by differential centrifugation exactly as detailed previously (19) except
that the final resuspension was made to a concentration of 5 mg protein/
ml in a solution identical to that used for tubule incubation (see "Basic
procedures" section above), and all subsequent experimental procedures
exactly paralleled those used for intact tubule studies.
Morphologic studies. Preparations were routinely observed in the
fresh state by light microscopy and photographed. 0.4% trypan blue was
used to highlight nonviable cells. For microscopic studies of fixed material,
tubules were pelleted, fixed in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate pH 7.4, 2%
glutaraldehyde, and then processed for light microscopy of semithin sec￾tions as previously described (19).
Protein assay. Proteins were quantified by the Lowry assay (22).
Reagents. All reagents used were of the highest grade commercially
available. All organic reagents were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co.,
St. Louis, MO, unless otherwise indicated.
General experimental design. Tubule studies were conducted ac￾1194 J. M. Weinberg

cording to the general protocols outlined in Fig. 1. Washed tubule sus￾pensions were kept at 4VC after completion of tubule isolation until
samples were needed for particular experiments. All experiments were
started by incubating tubules in oxygenated medium at 370C for 15 min.
At the end of this period the flasks of tubules were reoxygenated with
95% 02/5% CO2 (as a handling control and to allow addition of exper￾imental agents) or were gassed with 95% N2/5% CO2 for 5 min to remove
medium oxygen. The final steady-state level of hypoxia was reached
within 2 min of starting 95% N2/5% CO2. 90%o of the decrease in medium
02 occurred in the first minute.
To produce oxygen deprivation under hypoxic conditions, tubules
in flasks which had been gassed with 95% N2/5% CO2 were sealed and
maintained in suspension at the usual concentration, 5-7.5 mg of tubule
protein/ml, by shaking the flasks in the water bath in a fashion identical
to that used to keep control tubules oxygenated. To study tubules oxygen￾deprived under conditions more closely simulating the high tubule density
present during ischemia in vivo, the contents of a flask (4.5 ml of tubule
suspension) were gassed with 95% N2/5% CO2 for 5 min, then were
rapidly transferred to a 15-ml centrifuge tube which was gassed with
95% N2/5% C02, sealed, and centrifuged at 30 g for 30-40 s, a time
sufficient to pellet all tubules lightly at the bottom of the centrifuge tube.
The tube was then incubated without shaking at 370C for the desired
duration of oxygen deprivation. At the end of the oxygen deprivation
period, these tubules were resuspended in the full volume of incubation
medium by gently inverting the tube twice.
Depending on the desired length of hypoxia or ischemia for particular
experiments, tubules were oxygen deprived for either 15, 30, or 60 min
timed from the initiation of gassing with 95% N2/5% CO2. After the
period of oxygen deprivation, tubules were either sampled for metabolic
studies or were reoxygenated with 95% 02/5% CO2 (ischemic tubules
were transferred back to Erlenmeyer flasks for reoxygenation). After an
additional 60-min period of incubation in oxygenated medium, tubules
were sampled for final study.
Statistics. Most studies involved multigroup comparisons and were,
therefore, initially assessed by analysis of variance using models account￾ingfor repeated measure designs (BMDP Statistical Software, Los Angeles,
CA) (23). Individual group comparisons in these multigroup studies were
then made using Scheffe's test for multiple comparisons (24). For ex￾perimental designs consisting of only two groups, unpaired or paired
Student's t tests with P < 0.05, two-tailed, considered to be significant
were used. For multigroup comparisons among unpaired groups a one￾way analysis of variance was utilized.

lengths of incubation time at 370C are summarized in Tables I
and II. These groups consist of the same preparations used for
the oxygen deprivation studies summarized in Tables III and
IV. Average control basal respiratory rates ranged from 39.9 to
45.9 natoms of oxygen/min per mg of protein and tended to be
5-10% lower at 90-135 min of incubation than at 15 min. Av￾erage CCCLP uncoupled respiratory rates ranged from 127.5 to
154.3 natoms of oxygen/min per mg of protein in these groups.
Lowest uncoupled respiratory rates were seen at 15 min of in￾cubation, rates peaked at 30-60 min of incubation and then fell
off slightly at 90-135 min of incubation, but the absolute changes
were small and did not reach statistical significance. Succinate,
added after CCCLP, did not further stimulate the respiratory
rate in control tubules.
Average K+ levels in the cold tubules at the end of the iso￾lation procedure ranged from 137.4 to 147.6 nmol/mg of protein.
15 min of incubation at 370C raised cell K+ to 298.7-325.6
nmol/mg of protein (P < 0.01 in all groups). During 105-135
min of further incubation, cell K+ levels tended to increase to
average values of 317.2-347.6 nmol/mg of protein, but none of
the differences between cell K+levels at 15 min and at the longest
intervals of incubation at 370C reached significance within in￾dividual groups. Cell Ca"+ levels averaged 20.7-23.9 nmol/mg
of protein in the cold preparations. After 15 min of incubation
at 370C they averaged 18.9-20.2 nmol/mg of protein, and after
105-135 min of incubation they averaged 12.0-14.3 nmol/mg
of protein (P < 0.05, 15 min vs. longest duration of incubation
in each group). Cell Mg++ levels averaged 40.5-49.7 nmol/mg
of protein and did not consistently change during incubation.
The values given for protein recovery indicate the percentage
of tubule protein from the total suspension that was recovered
in the lower sucrose-Ficoll layer after centrifugation ofthe tubules
through bromododecane to separate them rapidly from their
suspending medium for determination of intracellular solute
levels without major extracellular space contamination. As de￾tailed further below, this appears to be a very good quantitative
index of tubule structural integrity. Average protein recoveries
ranged from 82.8 to 104.3% with most values between 90 and
100% for these control preparations.
The intracellular adenine nucleotide values given in Tables
I and II were obtained by subtracting the levels of adenine nu￾cleotides measured in the tubule suspending medium after tu￾bules were removed by high-speed centrifugation from the ad￾enine nucleotide levels of the original suspension. In control
preparations only AMP is present in the medium in amounts,
0.13-0.39 nmol/mg of protein in the groups studied, that result
in substantial corrections to suspension values. Medium ADP
levels averaged 0.06-0.15 nmol/mg of protein while ATP levels
were 0.01-0.10 nmol/mg of protein.
Average intracellular AMP levels were 0.29-0.47 nmol/mg
of protein in cold and 15-min incubated samples and were 0.15-
0.24 nmol/mg of protein with 105-135 min of incubation. The
differences among AMP levels during incubation did not reach
statistical significance within these groups. Average ADP levels
ranged from 1.51 to 2.50 nmol/mg of protein in the cold samples,
were 1.12-1.34 nmol/mg of protein with 15 min of incubation
at 37°C and 1.05-1.34 nmol/mg of protein at 105-135 min (P
< 0.05 or better, cold samples vs. all durations of incubation at
37°C). Average ATP levels of the cold samples were 2.75-5.22
nmol/mg of protein. They increased sharply with 15 min of
incubation to 5.02-7.00 nmol/mg of protein (P < 0.01, all
groups) and thereafter, rose more gradually to 6.40-9.67 nmol/

mg of protein at 105-135 min of incubation (P < 0.01 or better
vs. 15 min). Total adenine nucleotides behaved similarly to the
ATP levels, reflecting the quantitative predominance ofthat nu￾cleotide. Thus, tubules in suspension studied during up to 135
min of incubation at 370C maintained a predictable, reproduc￾ible, and relatively high degree of metabolic stability with regard
to basic parameters of oxidative energy metabolism, adenine
nucleotides, and intracellular cation homeostasis.
Effects ofoxygen deprivation. The response ofthe preparation
to oxygen deprivation and to oxygen deprivation followed by a
60-min recovery period under reoxygenated conditions is sum￾marized in Tables III and IV. The 15- and 30-min hypoxia ex￾periments were done on the same preparations of tubules for
which the time control studies are summarized in Table I as
group A. The 30- and 60-min ischemia studies were done on
the same tubule preparations for which the time control studies
are summarized in Table II as groups B and C.
Respiratory rates were measured only after the reoxygenation
period (oxygen levels immediately at the end of the oxygen de￾privation periods were at the lower limit of detectability of the
instrumentation used with all types of oxygen deprivation). Both
basal and CCCLP-uncoupled respiratory rates behaved similarly.
They were severely depressed relative to time controls after 30
min of hypoxia (P < 0.01) and were moderately depressed after
15 min of hypoxia (P < 0.01) or 60 min of ischemia (P < 0.01).
The minimally decreased rates after 30 min of ischemia were
not significantly different from those of time controls in this
study. 30-min hypoxic tubules had significantly slower rates than
15-min hypoxic or 30- or 60-min ischemic tubules (P < 0.001).
60-min ischemic tubules had significantly lower rates than 30-
min ischemic tubules (P < 0.05). Ratios of CCCLP-uncoupled
rates with succinate to rates without succinate were markedly
elevated above time control values (0.9-1.0) after 30 min of
hypoxia (P < 0.01) and were minimally but significantly elevated
after 60 min of ischemia (P < 0.01). Succinate did not signifi￾cantly affect CCCLP-uncoupled rates after 15 min of hypoxia
or 30 min of ischemia.
Data on cell electrolyte levels are available for both the end
ofthe oxygen deprivation period (N) and the end ofthe recovery
period (R). The amounts ofprotein recovered in the tubule pellets
centrifuged through bromododecane and used for determination
of cell electrolytes varied markedly as a function of the type of
oxygen deprivation. Protein recovery was severely diminished
to <25% (P < 0.01 vs. time controls) at both N and R sampling
times after 30 min of hypoxia. With 15 min of hypoxia or 30
min of ischemia, protein recovery was not diminished relative
to time controls in the N samples but did decrease moderately
in the R samples (P < 0.05). With 60 min of ischemia, protein
recovery was moderately diminished relative to time controls
in both N and R samples (P < 0.05).
Cell K+ levels were sharply reduced relative to time controls
(P < 0.01) at the end of oxygen deprivation. Ischemic tubules
tended to have slightly higher K+ levels at this point than hypoxic
tubules but the differences among the groups were not statistically

but remained significantly depressed relative to time controls (P
< 0.01). After 30 min of ischemia and recovery, cell K+ was
slightly but not significantly lower than in time controls. Ofnote,
the protein recovery results indicate that, after 15 min ofhypoxia,
30 min of ischemia, and 60 min of ischemia, electrolytes were
being measured on very high fractions of the available tubule
material. After 30 min of hypoxia, however, the protein mea￾surements indicated that electrolytes were only being sampled
on <25% ofthe tubule material. As detailed below, morphologic
observations on fresh whole suspensions after oxygen deprivation
and on the tubule pellets obtained from these preparations after
centrifugation through bromododecane indicated that the cen￾trifuged samples contained a higher proportion ofrelatively intact
tubules than the whole suspensions. Thus, the diminished K+
recovery after 30 min of hypoxia represents that which occurred
in the least damaged subpopulation oftubules with this oxygen
deprivation condition.
After 15 min of hypoxia, cell Call was slightly but not sig￾nificantly elevated relative to the time control. Ca" did not fall
with reoxygenation after 15 min of hypoxia, and as a result, was
significantly elevated relative to the time control at the end of
the recovery period (P < 0.05). After 30 min of hypoxia, cell
Ca" was substantially elevated relative to the time control (P
< 0.01) then dropped significantly (P < 0.01, N vs. R) during
reoxygenation to a level approaching and not significantly higher
than that seen in the time control. In 30- and 60-min ischemic
tubules, cell Ca"+ levels measured at the end of ischemia were
not significantly different from Ca++ levels in the time controls
and, in fact, tended to be slightly lower. Cell Ca"+ did not change
significantly with reoxygenation in either of the ischemic groups.
Cell Mg"+ levels were not consistently affected by oxygen
deprivation and were similar to those seen in time controls except
for a nonsignificant elevation at the end of 30 min of hypoxia.
Table IV summarizes the behavior of cellular adenine nu￾cleotides in response to the oxygen deprivation maneuvers. The
first set of values are the estimated intracellular levels obtained
by subtracting from total suspension values the concentrations
ofadenine nucleotides measured in the suspending medium after
precipitation of tubule material by high-speed centrifugation.
The second set of values are the intracellular levels directly mea￾sured on tubules separated from medium by centrifugation
through bromododecane into TCA. The amounts oftubule pro￾tein recovered in the lower TCA layer are also given, and, as
was the case with the protein recovery in samples used for elec￾trolyte determinations, these values varied with the conditions
of oxygen deprivation. The levels of nucleotides measured in
the tubule suspending medium after removal oftubules by high￾speed centrifugation are also summarized.
Based on the total cell levels estimated from the whole sus￾pension values, all types of oxygen deprivation were associated
with increases in cell AMP (P < 0.05 or better vs. time controls).
Highest AMP levels followed 15 min of hypoxia, intermediate
levels followed 30 and 60 min of ischemia (P < 0.01 vs. 15 min
of hypoxia) and lowest levels were seen after 30 min of hypoxia
(P < 0.01 vs. all other groups). With reoxygenation, the AMP
levels returned to values similar to those seen in time controls.

of the oxygen deprivation on tubules separated from their me￾dium by centrifugation through bromododecane were signifi￾cantly lower (P < 0.01 for all groups except 30 min of hypoxia)
than those estimated from total suspension and medium levels.
ADP and ATP levels were higher (P < 0.05 or better for all
groups) than the levels estimated for the total suspension. Total
adenine nucleotide levels at the end of oxygen deprivation were
significantly higher in separated tubules than in the total sus￾pensions after 30 min of hypoxia (P < 0.01) but did not signif￾icantly differ from total suspension values in the other groups.
The decreases of AMP levels and increases in ATP levels without
changes in total adenine nucleotides at the end of oxygen de￾privation in the bromododecane-centrifuged tubules from groups
with mild injury suggest that sufficient oxygenation of these
preparations occurred during centrifugation to allow some re￾sumption of ATP synthesis. The absence of such an effect after
30 min of hypoxia is likely due to the more severe injury present
in that group. Thus, the adenine nucleotide levels of the tubules
separated by centrifugation through bromododecane at the end
of hypoxia reflect the state of cell adenine nucleotide metabolism
during oxygen deprivation less accurately than estimates based
on total suspension and medium values.
The differences for most nucleotide parameters between total
suspension and centrifuged sample levels at the end of the re￾covery period, a time when all samples are fully oxygenated,
were minimal and were not statistically significant in mildly
injured tubules (15-min hypoxic, 30- or 60-min ischemic), a
situation identical to that seen in the control preparations. The
differences after recovery between nucleotide levels in separated
tubules and total suspensions for severely injured tubules, i.e.,
those subjected to 30 min of hypoxia, were striking (P < 0.01
for all nucleotide parameters except AMP). These observations
are consistent with the protein recovery and electrolyte data sug￾gesting that the bromododecane centrifugation separates a more
intact subpopulation of tubules from the total suspension under
conditions where widespread injury has occurred.
The experiments comparing modes of oxygen deprivation,
which are summarized in Tables III and IV, were done on dif￾ferent groups of tubule preparations. Although overall control
tubule function (as summarized in Tables I and II) and the re￾sponse of the preparation to various maneuvers were relatively
constant, we felt it was desirable to assess the response oftubules
to 30 min of ischemia and 30 min of hypoxia simultaneously
in the same preparations. Furthermore, tubules subjected to
simulated ischemia differ from those subjected to hypoxia in
that they are not agitated during the period ofoxygen deprivation.
Because the extent to which such tubule preparations are stirred
has been shown to influence their integrity (8), we included in
this series of experiments an oxygen deprivation maneuver in
which the gas atmosphere of the incubation flask was changed
to 95% N2/5% CO2 as routinely done. The tubules were then
allowed to settle as a loose diffuse layer to the bottom of the
flask and to remain without stirring during the entire period of
oxygen deprivation. These tubules are indicated as "not shaken"
(NS) preparations. The results of measurements of several of
the key metabolic parameters in this experimental group are
summarized in Table V and indicate that the markedly different
responses to ischemia and hypoxia were fully retained when
both maneuvers were studied in the same preparation. Further￾more, tubules that were not shaken during hypoxia behaved in
a fashion indistinguishable from those which were shaken, in￾dicating that the absence of mechanical agitation did not account
for the protection seen in the ischemic tubules.
Table VI summarizes the results of two studies designed to
better define the basis for the tubule response to addition of
succinate. In the first study tubules were either oxygenated for
105 min or were oxygenated for 15 min, made hypoxic for 30
min, and then reoxygenated for 60 min, as in the standard ex￾perimental protocol. Then they were studied in the oximeter
with succinate added after CCCLP as well as with succinate
added during basal respiration before CCCLP. When succinate
was added after CCCLP, the usual pattern of effects was seen,
in that respiration was not stimulated in time control oxygenated
tubules but was strikingly stimulated in the posthypoxic tubules
(P = 0.01). When succinate was added during basal respira￾tion to control oxygenated tubules, respiration increased to

1 12.6±2.8% of basal rates (P < 0.02, succinate vs. basal rate).
A much larger stimulation of basal rates, 298.6±5.7%, was seen
when succinate was added to posthypoxic tubules (P = 0.02,
succinate vs. basal rate, P < 0.01, relative stimulation in control
vs. posthypoxic tubules). Although the relative stimulation of
respiration when succinate was added to injured tubule prepa￾rations during basal respiration tended to be higher than the
relative simulation seen when it was added during CCCLP-un￾coupled respiration (186.1 ± 11.2%), the difference did not reach
statistical significance. In both control and injured tubules, the
final respiratory rates measured with both succinate and CCCLP
present were the same irrespective of the order of addition of
the agents and these rates were significantly lower in posthypoxic
tubules than in time controls (P < 0.01).
In the second study summarized in Table VI, isolated rabbit
renal cortical mitochondria were incubated under control oxy￾genated conditions exactly the same as those used to incubate
the intact tubules, thus simulating the conditions to which free
mitochondria are exposed in the injured tubule preparations
during the reoxygenation period. Basal respiratory rates were
extremely low and were moderately stimulated by CCCLP (P
= 0.05). Subsequent addition of succinate, however, led to a
striking stimulation of respiration (P < 0.01).
Effects ofpH. In establishing the experimental system and
routinely monitoring it to assure constancy of experimental
variables, we had confirmed that regassing the tubule suspension
with 95% N2/5% CO2 did not affect its pH, which was maintained
at 7.40-7.45. This was expected given the 25 mM HCO- present
in the medium, the 5% CO2 with N2 in the gas phase, and the
relatively small amount of tubule material relative to suspending
medium volume. Tubule suspension pH values averaged
0.1±0.02 pH units less than similarly incubated suspending me￾dium without tubules (n = 10, P < 0.01). Tubule suspensions
incubated for 30 min under 95% N2/5% C02 had suspension
pHs which were 0.04±0.02 pH units greater than paired samples
maintained under 95% 02/5% CO2 (n = 10, P < 0.05). It was
possible, though, that, when the tubules were pelleted to a much
higher density relative to surrounding medium to produce the
simulated ischemic conditions, their metabolic processes could
result in more substantial alterations of pH during oxygen de￾privation. To test this, a small-tipped pH electrode was placed
in the center of the centrifuged pellet used to produce the isch￾emic conditions at the start of the oxygen deprivation period.
Results of a typical experiment are illustrated in Fig. 2. The first
stable pH measurement obtainable after the 30 s necessary to
centrifuge the pellet is already reduced relative to the overlying
suspending medium. Thereafter, pH drops at a steadily decreas￾ing rate during 20-30 min after which it stabilizes. When, after
60 min, the pH electrode is pulled out of the pellet into the
medium just overlying it, the normal medium pH is then again
measured. In six experiments, pellet pH had stabilized at an
average value of 6.96±04 by the end of 60 min of incubation.
The average pH in the medium overlying these samples was
7.42±.00 (P < 0.00 1).
To test whether such a fall in pH could account for the dif￾ferences in response to oxygen deprivation between ischemic
and hypoxic tubules, tubules were subjected to 30 min of hypoxia
at a wide range of pHs produced by adding HCO to the tubule
suspensions at the initiation of hypoxia. Sodium bicarbonate
was then added at the end of hypoxia to restore the normal
suspension pH and fully simulate the conditions ofstudy utilized
for the ischemic pellets which are resuspended in the normal
incubation medium at the end of oxygen deprivation. Time
control studies in which tubules were subjected to the same pH
manipulations as the hypoxic tubules were also done for every
preparation.
The effects of pH manipulation on behavior of various met￾abolic parameters in the time control studies are summarized
in Table VII. The tubules from which these data were generated

were initially incubated for 15 min at 370C. Then varying
amounts of HCI were added to lower the medium pH to as low
as 6.41 and incubation was continued for an additional 30 min
at the end of which time the tubules were sampled. To simplify
presentation of these control data they are tabulated in Table
VII as mean values for groups of tubules with pH levels at the
extremes of the range studied, i.e., >7.3 (includes mainly prep￾arations which did not receive HCI, n = 15) and <6.9 (n = 11).
Additionally, to summarize succinctly the behavior of each pa￾rameter over the full range of pH values assessed, the correlation
between values for each metabolic parameter and medium pH
for the entire group of tubule preparations studied is given.
Trends toward mild reductions in both basal and CCCLP-un￾coupled respiratory rates were seen as pH was decreased; how￾ever, the differences reached significance only in comparing
CCCLP uncoupled rates in tubules studied at pH < 6.9 to those
studied at pH > 7.3. Tubule K+, protein recovery, and ATP
levels were not affected by the pH manipulations. Tubule cell
Ca"+ fell significantly as medium pH was reduced. This effect
was significant both in comparing tubules at the extremes of the
pH range studied and as an overall negative correlation between
cell Ca"+ and medium pH across the entire range of pHs studied.
The effects of incubation medium pH on hypoxic tubules
are illustrated in Figs. 3-10. Fig. 3 summarizes the effects of pH
during hypoxia on CCCLP uncoupled respiratory rates measured
at the end ofthe reoxygenation recovery period. A virtually linear
inverse relationship between pH and respiratory rate is seen (r
= -.917, P < 0.01). Fig. 3 also illustrates the effects of succinate
on CCCLP-uncoupled respiration. Substantial stimulation by
succinate of CCCLP-uncoupled respiration occurred only in tu￾bules subjected to hypoxia at pH levels above 7.0.
Fig. 4 summarizes the relationships between protein recovery
at the end of hypoxia and hypoxia plus reoxygenation and the
medium pH maintained during hypoxia. Protein recovery is
maintained at virtually 100% at the end of hypoxia until pHs
exceed about 7.0 and, thereafter, it falls off sharply. With hypoxia
plus reoxygenation, a similar relationship is observed but the
best recoveries are somewhat lower than those seen at the end
of hypoxia because of small decreases in protein recovery during
reoxygenation in the least-injured tubules.
Fig. 5 illustrates the behavior of cell K+. K+ levels at the end
of hypoxia did not vary substantially except for being slightly
higher at the lowest pHs tested. With reoxygenation, K+ rose
toward, but did not consistently reach control levels and showed
a moderate but significant inverse correlation with the pH main￾tained during hypoxia (r = 0.654, P < 0.01).
Tubule Ca"+ levels are summarized in Fig. 6. They were
elevated at the end of hypoxia relative to time controls in samples
whose pHs were maintained above about 7.0 during hypoxia.
With hypoxia + reoxygenation, the effects of pH during hypoxia
were less marked although higher pHs were still associated with
higher Ca`+ levels. These relationships are further clarified in
Fig. 7, which shows that, when Ca`+ was maintained in the
normal range during hypoxia, it generally rose with reoxygen￾150

values seen at the higher pHs tested. Tubule cell ATP levels
increased toward control values during recovery and the ATP
levels reached correlated closely with the pH maintained during
hypoxia (r = -0.837, P < 0.01). ADP levels showed relatively
small changes under the conditions tested so that changes in

nucleotides are summarized in Fig. 10. The total adenine nu￾cleotide pool was reduced relative to that in time controls during
hypoxia but this reduction was less marked at low pH. In tubules
maintained during hypoxia at pH values below 7.0 the total
adenine nucleotide pool always increased with recovery toward
time control levels, usually by a substantial amount. With pH
values above 7.0 during hypoxia, the response of the adenine
nucleotide pool during recovery was much more variable. Fur￾ther decreases relative to time control levels were observed in
many preparations and, when increases were seen, they were
generally small.
Morphologic observations. Tubule preparations consisted
mainly of short lengths of well-preserved proximal tubules at
the end of the preparation procedure. Trypan blue-positive cells
were limited and were located mostly at the ends of tubule
lengths. During incubation at 370C, good tubule lengths re￾mained for the entire duration of study, however, more short
lengths appeared with longer incubation times as did some Try￾pan blue-positive cells, mostly as individual cells free in the me￾dium. 15 min of hypoxia resulted in moderately increased num￾bers of Trypan blue-positive cells within tubule lengths and as
free material but most tubule cells did not sustain lethal cell
injury by this criterion. With 30 min of hypoxia at pHs above
7.0, there was a great increase in the amount of subcellular debris
and of free cells, virtually all Trypan blue-positive. Of the re￾maining tubule lengths many had mostly Trypan blue-positive
cells. Tubule preparations subjected to ischemia for 30 or 60
min or to hypoxia at pHs below 7.0 showed increases in the
numbers of Trypan blue-positive cells mainly as free cells but
most tubule lengths appeared to be as well preserved as those
in time controls. In control and ischemic preparations, the tubule
material pelleted by centrifugation through bromododecane ap￾peared similar to that ofthe initial suspensions. In hypoxic prep￾arations with severe injury, the bromododecane pellets contained
a much higher proportion of intact lengths of tubules, fewer free
cells, and less subcellular debris than present in the tubule sus￾pensions prior to centrifugation.

Tubule cell injury is a prominent component of ischemic acute
renal failure, although its manifestations vary with the model
studied (3, 4). As with ischemic cell injury in other tissues, a
better understanding of the pathophysiology of ischemic acute
renal failure at the tubule cell level could lead to more effective
approaches to its prevention in the clinical setting. The study of
ischemic cell injury in tubule cells from renal cortex is of ad￾ditional relevance to understanding ischemic cell injury in gen￾eral because of the feasibility of readily isolating intact renal
tubules for study in vitro and the large amount of available data
on the normal physiology and metabolism of such tubule prep￾arations (8, 10, 17, 18, 25, 26).
This paper defines the suitability of isolated renal tubule
preparations for studying ischemic cell injury and provides in￾sight into several major processes in its pathogenesis. Prior studies
have provided valuable data on the behavior of a number of
metabolic and structural parameters of isolated hepatocytes and
myocytes subject to hypoxic injury in vitro (1 1-14). The present
study is the first detailed report of this kind applicable to the
kidney and provides a comprehensive analysis of the simulta￾neous behaviors of multiple critical injury-related metabolic pa￾rameters during an in vitro model fully characterized as to its

acute time course, reversibility, and probable relationship to in￾jury in vivo. The methods employed for tubule isolation in the
present study included procedures similar to those described in
recent reports detailing successful preparations of high quality
proximal tubule-enriched suspensions of tubules from renal
cortex (17, 27). No tissue preparation studied in vitro precisely
reproduces the characteristics and stability of cells in vivo.
Rather, some compromises must be accepted for the advantages
of access and direct study of processes in a controlled experi￾mental setting. Although incubated in simple salt solutions, the
tubule preparation exhibits quite reproducible and stable func￾tion with regard to key cellular metabolic parameters for dura￾tions of incubation at 370C in excess of 2 h, a period in which
the present study demonstrates that many of the acute events
of ischemic renal tubular cell injury can be reproduced. The
values for cellular electrolyte levels and adenine nucleotides
compare closely with levels reported in vivo for renal cortex and
to values for these parameters reported for prior isolated proximal
tubule enriched suspension preparations (18, 19, 26-30). No
precise data are available for comparing the respiratory rates
with rates in vivo, however, their stability, the marked stimu￾lation of basal rates produced by uncouplers, and their similarity
to respiratory rates previously reported in detail for other prep￾arations of this type argue for a highly intact system ( 18, 31).
The parameters routinely measured on all tubule prepara￾tions cover major processes generally deemed important in the
development of cell injury: the capacity for oxidative metabo￾lism, the adenine nucleotide pool, and the ability of the cell to
maintain its net monovalent cation and calcium homeostasis
(2, 32).
30 min of hypoxia produced by changing the gas phase of
the incubating flasks from 95% 02/5% CO2 to 95% N2/5% CO2
resulted in striking changes in the tubule suspension during hy￾poxia and after hypoxia plus 60 min of recovery in oxygenated
medium. Cell respiratory rates after reoxygenation were reduced
to <30% oftime controls and, succinate, which did not stimulate
uncoupled respiration in time controls, strikingly stimulated
respiration. Stimulation of basal respiration by succinate has
been used as an index ofthe presence of marked cell membrane
injury and/or free mitochondria in studies ofisolated hepatocytes
in that neither respiration nor gluconeogenesis are stimulated
by succinate in intact isolated hepatocytes or in isolated perfused
liver but respiration is markedly stimulated by succinate in
damaged, permeabilized hepatocytes (33-35). Renal tubules, in
contrast, have a brush border membrane Na+-succinate cotrans￾port system, which allows succinate to enter tubule cells (31),
gain access to mitochondria, and stimulate metabolism and res￾piration in intact tubules and the isolated perfused kidney (27,
36, 37). This likely accounts for the stimulation of basal rates
by succinate in the experiment summarized in Table VI. To
avoid this confounding factor in interpreting succinate stimu￾lation as an index of injury, in the present study succinate was
added during CCCLP-uncoupled respiration rather than during
basal respiration. Succinate did not stimulate uncoupled respi￾ration in control tubules but consistently did so in tubule prep￾arations which, on the basis ofother metabolic and morphologic
parameters, had sustained lethal cell injury. The data summa￾rized in Table VI show that succinate also produced a marked
stimulation of basal respiration in the injured tubules, a result
comparable to that reported for hepatocytes (33, 34). The ex￾tremely low basal and CCCLP-uncoupled respiratory rates of
isolated mitochondria incubated in the tubule incubation me￾Table VII. Effects of Tubule Incubation

dium before the addition of succinate suggest that free mito￾chondria and mitochondria in highly permeabilized cells do not
contribute substantially to respiration measured during normal
incubation conditions, but the addition of succinate, a substrate
that they can metabolize, allows for the respiration of free mi￾tochondria and mitochondria in damaged and highly permea￾bilized cells to be detected and utilized as an index of their pres￾ence and of the occurrence of the advanced cell injury which
produced them. The stimulation produced by succinate in prep￾arations with severe injury is only relative to the depressed rates
in its absence. Maximal respiratory rates in the presence of suc￾cinate and CCCLP, irrespective of the order of their addition,
are consistently, substantially less in the severely injured prep￾arations than in the oxygenated control preparations reflecting
irreversible damage to mitochondrial functional capacity.
The number of tubules sufficiently intact to have retained
density characteristics allowing them to be separated from the
suspension medium by the bromododecane centrifugation pro￾cedure was markedly diminished after 30 min of hypoxia as
indicated by the reduced protein recovery in the sucrose-Ficoll
layer. Cell K+ in these recovered tubules was markedly reduced
at the end of hypoxia. It increased substantially with reoxygen￾ation but remained significantly reduced relative to time controls.
Cell Ca`+ was significantly elevated at the end of hypoxia, then
dropped with reoxygenation. Cell ATP estimated using total
suspension measurements was strikingly reduced at the end of
hypoxia as was the total adenine nucleotide pool because a mod￾erate increase in cell AMP did not compensate for the decreases
in ATP. Cell ATP recovered partially with reoxygenation but
it, and, as a result, the total adenine nucleotide pool remained
very low compared to time controls.
Morphologic observations indicated that 30 min of hypoxia
resulted in the loss ofmost lengths oftubules and the conversion
1204 J. M. Weinberg

of most remaining tubule cells to being trypan blue-positive.
Tubule material recovered after centrifugation through bro￾mododecane was highly enriched in more intact-appearing tu￾bules as compared to the total suspensions, however, lethally
injured cells were also present.
Taken together, the metabolic and morphologic observations
demonstrate that extensive lethal cell injury develops during 30
min of hypoxia. Measurements made on the total suspension
and factored for total protein such as respiratory rates in the
absence of succinate and estimated cell ATP levels probably
reflect mainly the contribution of the remaining more intact
tubules since isolated mitochondria do not effectively use glucose,
lactate, alanine, or butyrate as respiratory substrates under the
conditions used for tubule incubation (Table VI and reference
38) and free ATP in tubule suspensions is rapidly hydrolyzed
(39). These more intact tubules are selectively separated by the
bromododecane centrifugation procedure and thus may be
quantified directly by measuring the amount ofprotein recovered
in the sucrose-Ficoll layer.
15 min of hypoxia, despite producing major alterations in
cell K+ and ATP levels, did not produce widespread lethal renal
tubular cell injury as indicated by good recoveries with oxygen￾ation of respiratory function, cell K+, and adenine nucleotides,
the maintenance of a relatively high protein recovery and the
absence of substantial stimulation of respiration by succinate.
Morphologic observations were consistent with this interpreta￾tion. It is of note, however, that evidence for some lethal cell
injury with 15 min of hypoxia was present and protein recovery
did fall significantly upon reoxygenation after 15 min of hypoxia
relative to time controls. This evidence for lethal cell injury pro￾gressing during reoxygenation corresponds to the timing of the
appearance of lethal cell injury in vivo, i.e., with reperfusion (3,
40), and is in contrast to the situation seen with 30 min of hy￾poxia, where, based on protein recoveries and morphology, most
lethal cell injury occurred during hypoxia. Considering the 15-
and 30-min data in combination, the results indicate the oc￾currence of a process accounting for simultaneous loss of large
numbers of tubules with durations of hypoxia between 15 and
30 min. This observation contrasts with substantial data from
in vivo ischemia models in multiple species including the rabbit
that indicate that renal proximal tubules uniformly survive 25-
30 min of ischemia in vivo without substantial lethal cell injury
during ischemia or reperfusion. Widespread lethal proximal tu￾bule cell injury generally requires 60 min of ischemia (3,
40, 41).
In considering why tubules were apparently more susceptible
to injury from hypoxia in vitro than from ischemia in vivo, cell
density was a major factor that could contribute to the devel￾opment of cell injury that distinguished the hypoxia model in
vitro from ischemia in vivo. Tubules in the system studied in
vitro were at relatively low density so that metabolic products
generated by the tubules during oxygen deprivation and substrate
availability would be less likely to influence the course of tubule
cell injury than in the ischemic kidney in vivo. Therefore, in
order to simulate more closely the conditions present during
ischemia in vivo, tubules were gently pelleted by low-speed cen￾trifugation at the beginning ofoxygen deprivation and were kept
as pellets until they were reoxygenated. Measurements of intra￾cellular vs. extracellular water spaces in these pellets showed
intracellular water to be 54% oftotal pellet water, a value some￾what less than the value of the kidney in vivo but far higher than
the 1.6% estimated for tubules in suspension (data not shown).
The responses of tubules subjected to ischemia in vitro were
strikingly different from those of tubules subjected to hypoxia,
in that, based on all the quantitative metabolic parameters mea￾sured as well as on their morphologic appearance, ischemic tu￾bules were highly protected from the development of oxygen
deprivation-induced lethal cell injury. 30 min of ischemia pro￾duced as little or less injury than 15 min of hypoxia. Even more
striking than this, although progressive injury between 30 and
60 min ofischemia was identifiable, it was moderate (e.g., protein
recovery after 60 min of ischemia plus recovery exceeded 75%)
as compared to the explosive damage occurring between 15 and
30 min of hypoxia. Such protection occurred in spite of the
manifestations of the full effects of hypoxia metabolically, e.g.,
ATP levels between 30 and 60 min of ischemia were no higher
than those between 15 and 30 min of hypoxia in either whole
suspensions or bromododecane separated tubule pellets. The
protection afforded by pelleting the tubules during oxygen de￾privation was shown not to relate to the absence of tubule agi￾tation during that period. These data indicate that, when studied
at densities closer to those present in vivo, the susceptibility of
the isolated tubules to lethal cell injury induced by oxygen de￾privation is very similar to that of ischemic tubules in vivo.
Measurements ofpH within the tubule pellet during oxygen
deprivation indicated that, in contrast to suspensions ofhypoxic
tubules that maintain their pH levels close to the 7.4 predicted
from the bicarbonate-CO2 buffer system utilized, pelleted tubules
were in an environment of pH approximating 7.0 for much of
the period of oxygen deprivation, including the entire interval
between 30 and 60 min. This decrease in pH may have arisen
from several factors. Even though proximal tubules are generally
not considered to metabolize glucose extensively to lactate (2),
H+ production in the pelleted tubules could have resulted from
hydrolysis of ATP. It is now recognized that ATP hydrolysis is
likely to be the primary mechanism ofcellular acidification dur￾ing anoxia irrespective of the metabolic compensatory process
employed to generate ATP anaerobically (42, 43). An additional
factor which could have contributed to the acidification occurring
in the pellet is CO2 generation resulting from any small amount
of residual 02 remaining in solution after the gassing procedure.
CO2 generation by tubules has been proposed to account for the
slightly lower pH maintained by suspensions of tubules than by
tubule medium alone when both are similarly equilibrated with
CO2 (44). This phenomenon was seen in the present study in
the oxygenated samples. Additionally, hypoxic tubule suspen￾sions had slightly higher pHs than oxygenated suspensions, an
observation consistent with a role for tubule CO2 generation in
contributing to medium pH.
Rapid falls in tissue pH to levels of 6.5-7.0 have been doc￾umented during in vivo ischemia in a number oftissues including
the kidney (45, 46). Data available in the literature for a number
of models of injury including myocardial hypoxia (47), me￾chanical (48) and hypoxic (32) injury to hepatocytes, hypoxic
and toxic injury to Ehrlich ascites tumor cells (49, 50), and studies
of renal cortical slices (51) have suggested that reduction of pH
has protective effects against the development of cell injury.
However, a broad consensus on this issue has not been reached
and a recent report has proposed that the fall in pH during renal
ischemia is a major mediator of cell injury in the kidney (46).
To more directly test the influence of pH, the effects of al￾tering medium pH in the range 6.41-7.45 were studied in both
time control tubules and in tubules subjected to 30 min of hy￾poxia. Estimates of average intracellular pH values in time con￾Oxygen Deprivation Injury to Isolated Kidney Tubules 1205

trol oxygenated tubules using the distribution of ["4C]5,5-di￾methyloxazolidine-2,4-dione (data not shown) gave results
comparable to those previously reported for suspensions of renal
tubules (44, 51, 52) in that changes of the average intracellular
pH paralleled changes of the medium pH and average cell pHs
were slightly higher than medium pHs at medium pHs below
7.3. However, whole cell 5,5-dimethyloxazolidine-2,4-dione up￾take measurements reflect a combination of mitochondrial and
cystosolic pHs with mitochondrial pH being relatively alkaline
to the cytosol (52-54), and the relationship between cytosolic
and mitochondrial pHs is likely to change as mitochondria are
deenergized during oxygen deprivation. Consequently, further
studies of pH changes within each intracellular compartment
will be required to precisely quantitate the behavior of intracel￾lular pH in this system.
The results of the studies of the effects of medium pH ma￾nipulation on hypoxic injury indicated, on the basis of both the
multiple metabolic criteria measured as well as the morphologic
appearance of the tubules, that reducing medium pH in the
range 7.45-6.41 during hypoxia exerts a striking protective effect
against the development of oxygen deprivation-induced cell in￾jury. Furthermore, the critical extracellular pH required for this
protection to be virtually complete was -7.0-the steady-state
value achieved in the pellet studies used to simulate ischemic
injury. This suggests that the measured drop of pH in the isch￾emic pellets plays a major protective role and the falls in pH
that occur during ischemia in vivo act in a similarly protective
fashion. Tubules protected from hypoxia by reduced pH did
show some signs of further injury during reoxygenation, i.e.,
mildly reduced protein recoveries and increased cell Ca++ levels.
These observations raise the intriguing possibility that the "cor￾rection" of tissue acidosis that occurs during postischemic reflow
in vivo may at least transiently exacerbate cell injury, particularly
in marginally reperfused areas, and thus contribute to the com￾monly observed phenomenon that most lethal cell injury appears
gradually during reflow after ischemia rather than during isch￾emia (40).
In considering possible subcellular mechanisms by which
reduced pH might be protective, it is of note that both cell K+
and ATP levels were nearly as low during hypoxia in tubules
that were strongly protected as in those that were not. Although
small, but significantly positive, inverse correlations between pH
during hypoxia and cell content were observed for K+ and ATP,
a number of individual tubule preparations that were highly
protected had values for these parameters lower than those seen
in unprotected tubules. The improved preservation ofcell AMP
and total adenine nucleotide levels seen with low pH during
hypoxia may simply reflect the fact that fewer tubules had totally
lost structural integrity. These data suggest that the mechanism
of action of low pH in protecting against oxygen deprivation￾induced cell injury involves a process in the pathogenesis of
injury more basic than altering cellular energy balance or mono￾valent cation homeostasis.
Strikingly lower cell Ca++ levels were present in hypoxic tu￾bules protected by low pH than in unprotected tubules. A similar
difference in Ca++ levels was seen in the experiments comparing
hypoxic and ischemic tubules, suggesting that effects on intra￾cellular Ca++ metabolism may be involved in mediating the pro￾tection produced by low pH. These observations must, however,
be interpreted with caution because of the well-documented
ability of mitochondria, even after the occurrence of lethal cell
injury, to continue to actively sequester Ca"+ (2). Every oxygen
deprivation condition in the present series of studies in which
an increase in tubule cell Ca"+ occurred was accompanied by
disruption of renal tubule cells as indicated by diminished protein
recovery with the bromododecane centrifugation procedure and
morphologic appearance, whereas nonlethal insults were never
accompanied by increases in cell Ca". In this regard, the data
are similar to those recently reported in a study of the devel￾opment of nephrotoxic injury in vivo where no prolonged pre￾lethal injury phase of net cell Ca"+ influx could be identified
(19). Although Ca"+ determinations in the present study were
done only on the pellet material recovered with bromododecane
centrifugation, and this material was clearly enriched in the re￾maining viable tubules, some lethally injured material does ap￾pear in those pellets, and, given the high concentrations of Ca"+
that can occur in mitochondria after lethal cell injury (19), such
material may account for the elevations in Ca"+ measured. Fur￾ther studies will be required to determine definitively whether
the alterations of Ca"+ measured in this system are confined
only to lethally injured cells or represent an intracellular accu￾mulation of Ca"+ in cells not destined to become lethally cell
injured.
Although a definitive pathogenetic role cannot yet be ascribed
to Ca"+ based on the measurements in the severely injured tu￾bules, additional evidence favoring such a role is available from
the pH manipulation studies. Control oxygenated tubules in￾cubated at low pH maintained significantly lower total intra￾cellular Ca"+ levels than those incubated at normal pH levels.
A similar effect of pH on renal tubule cell Ca"+ levels has been
reported for isolated rat tubules (29). Although the mechanism
for this reduction of cell Ca"+ and the subcellular loci of the
effect remain to be elucidated, this observation suggests that low
pH has the potential to alter cellular Ca"+ dynamics in normal
and prelethally injured tubules and is consistent with observa￾tions that low pH reduces transmembrane Ca"+ flux in myo￾cardial cells (14, 55) and that rises in cell pH appear to promote
Ca"+-mediated events during cellular differentiation and repli￾cation (43). It has been reported that the kD for the binding of
Ca"+ to calmodulin is -10-fold higher (0.25 ,uM) at pH 6.5
than at pH 7.5 (0.02 iM) (43, 56). As noted by Busa and Nuc￾citelli (43), the ability of pH changes to alter both cell Ca"+
homeostasis and Ca"+ calmodulin interactions allows changes
in cell pH to play a potentially major role in modulating the
numerous cellular processes regulated by Ca"+ and calmodulin.
It is of importance, in this regard, that studies of activity of
plasma membrane phospholipases A and C and mitochondrial
phospholipases A have generally indicated that the pH optima
for these enzymes are above 7.0 and rather sharp decreases in
activity are observed below pH 7.0 (57-60). Inhibition of the
activity of membrane phospholipases by reduced pH via effects
on membrane Ca"+ and Ca"+ calmodulin as well as by direct
effects on the enzymes themselves is a mechanism for the pro￾tective effects of reduced pH which should be explored.
In summary, a reproducible model of oxygen deprivation￾induced injury to isolated proximal tubules has been developed
and critical cellular metabolic features of the process have been
analyzed and quantitated. Oxygen deprivation under hypoxic
conditions is far more injurious than under simulated ischemic
conditions. The fall in pH that occurs during ischemia appears
to be sufficient to account for the reduced susceptibility to oxygen
deprivation of ischemic tubules because pH changes ofthe same
degree produce equivalent protection in hypoxic tubules. The
protective effects of reduced pH may be mediated by alterations
