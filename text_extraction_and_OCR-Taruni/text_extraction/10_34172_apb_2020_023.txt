Abstract
Cadmium (Cd) is a significant ecotoxic heavy metal that adversely affects all biological processes of 
humans, animals and plants. Exposure to acute and chronic Cd damages many organs in humans 
and animals (e.g. lung, liver, brain, kidney, and testes). In humans, the Cd concentration at birth 
is zero, but because the biological half-life is long (about 30 years in humans), the concentration 
increases with age. The industrial developments of the last century have significantly increased 
the use of this metal. Especially in developing countries, this consumption is higher. Oxidative 
stress is the imbalance between antioxidants and oxidants. Cd increases reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) production and causes oxidative stress. Excess cellular levels of ROS cause damage to 
proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, membranes and organelles. This damage has been associated 
with various diseases. These include cancer, hypertension, ischemia/perfusion, cardiovascular 
diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, insulin resistance, acute respiratory 
distress syndrome, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, skin diseases, chronic kidney disease, 
eye diseases, neurodegenerative diseases (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, 
Alzheimer’s disease, and Huntington disease). Natural antioxidants are popular drugs that are 
used by the majority of people and have few side effects. Natural antioxidants play an important 
role in reducing free radicals caused by Cd toxicity. Our goal in this review is to establish the 
relationship between Cd and oxidative stress and to discuss the role of natural antioxidants in 
reducing Cd toxicity.

Introduction
Cadmium
Cadmium (Cd) is a bright silvery-white soft metal in group 
II B of the periodic table. Cd has an atomic number of 48, 
an atomic weight of 112.41 u and a density of 8.64 g/cm3
.
1,2
Cd is not pure in nature. However, it was purified for the 
first time in 1817 and had a commercial designation in 
the early 1900s.3
 Present in the ground at a rate of 0.15-
0.2 mg/kg, Cd is obtained as a by-product during the 
decomposition of zinc ore.4
 In the United Kingdom and 
the United States, some black clay deposits contain high 
levels of Cd, and there is Cd at high concentrations in 
the ground. The main source of Cd atmospheric release 
is volcanic activity. It is thought that the amount of Cd 
released by volcanic activity is between 100-500 tons. 
Volcanic movements in deep seas are also one of the 
natural sources of Cd.5
Cd usage areas
Cd is an easily formable metal due to its physically soft 
nature. It has a wide range of applications since it has 
excellent properties against corrosion and has important 
properties in metal usage such as low melting temperature.6 
Cd is most commonly used in the construction of nickel￾Cd batteries.7,8 Cd is widely used as a coating material in 
PVC and shipbuilding industry due to its resistance to 
oxidation. Cd sulfur compounds are also used as color 
materials in the production of plastic, glass, ceramic, 
rubber, paint and fireworks.9,10 In addition, household 
goods, automobiles and trucks, agricultural tools, aircraft 
parts, industrial tools, hand tools and fasteners (screw 
nuts, bolts, screws and nails) are generally covered with 
Cd. It is also used in tire repair and photography.11
The effects of Cd 
In humans, Cd exposure is due to food, inhalation and 
predominantly cigarette smoke.12 Exposure through the 
skin is less. Cadmium chloride (CaCl2
) is the major form 
of water-soluble Cd in high concentrations and is highly 
well absorbed from the mouth. Cadmium oxide (CaO) is

the most common form exposed through respiration.13 
Many occupational groups are exposed to significant 
proportions. Among these occupational groups, workers 
in mining, paint and battery factories are particularly 
exposed to significant amounts of Cd dust and fumes. 
Following these groups, smokers are those most exposed 
to Cd.14 One cigarette contains 1.5-2 μg of Cd. About 10% 
of it goes to cigarette smoke, and during smoking, 50% of 
this cigarette is absorbed by the lungs. Approximately 1 μg 
of Cd enters the body of a person smoking 20 cigarettes a 
day.15 Studies have shown that the Cd levels of smokers are 
3-4 times higher than those of non-smokers.16,17 In non￾smokers, Cd exposure is usually linked to food intake. 
The daily amount of Cd consumed by foodstuffs is about 
10-25 μg but may vary with environmental Cd rates. 
For example, in Japan, the amount of Cd taken by food 
is 28 μg/day compared to 9.9 μg/day in China and 9-10 
μg/day in Germany.18 In contaminated areas, Cd intake 
with food can reach several hundred micrograms per day. 
Drinking water usually contains Cd in low quantities, and 
the approximate amount is 1 μg/L or less.19,20 Cd is one 
of the most effective carcinogenic metals for humans. Cd 
and its compounds have been described among human 
carcinogens in 1993 by the International Organization 
for Cancer Research.21 Cd affects cellular proliferation, 
differentiation, apoptosis and other cellular activities.22 
Prolonged exposure to Cd can result in lung, prostate, 
testicular, and kidney cancer. Because the half-life of 
Cd is 10 to 30 years, the effect of this metal on it may be 
carcinogenic.23 Inactivation of tumor suppressor genes 
causes the deterioration of cell adhesion mechanism, 
triggering of apoptosis, suppression of DNA repair, 
free radical production and affecting the antioxidant 
system.24,25 Cd can easily penetrate the body and pass into 
the cytoplasm via the calcium channels through the cell 
membrane. It can then bind to intracellular molecules, 
accumulate in the cell, cause metabolic transformation, 
or be dislodged. High levels of Cd are bound by Cd 
by glutathione, sulfhydryl-rich soluble proteins and 
metallothioneins (MTs) in the cell to try to reduce the 
intracellular and extracellular fluid levels.26 Cd causes the 
release of free oxygen radicals such as superoxide (O2-), 
hydroxyl (OH-), nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen peroxide 
(H2
O2
) in the organism like other heavy metals.27 
Cd causes peroxidation in membrane lipids, 
degradation of the antioxidant defense system, the 
emergence of inflammation, protein structure disorders 
and the oxidation of nucleic acids, and it negatively affects 
the DNA repair mechanism. Cd is a very potent toxic 
metal that indirectly contributes to the production of free 
oxygen radical species.28-30
Cd and reproductive system
Exposure to Cd causes a decrease in reproductive 
performance evaluates such as fertility, abnormal 
embryonic development, prenatal death and sexual 
dysfunction.31 Prolonged exposure may cause structural 
and functional disturbances in the male and female 
reproductive system.32,33 In males, it causes a decrease 
in sperm motility and spermatogenesis index.34 Acute 
Cd-induced damage to the testes manifests itself with 
hemorrhagic inflammation, organ degeneration and 
dysfunction and vacuolization of the seminiferous 
tubules. It has been reported that after high doses of 
Cd, the seminiferous tubule diameter and the tubular 
volume density decrease markedly.32 In one study, 
39.98% of the reproductive capacities of rats that received 
Cd for 52 weeks orally were found to be reduced.35 In 
experimental studies on female rats, it has been reported 
that Cd ovulation is inhibited and that it directly reduces 
progesterone production by acting directly on granulosa 
cell morphology and steroid biosynthesis.36,37 Another 
in vivo study on female rabbits reported that when Cd 
chloride was administered at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg, there 
was a decrease in the number of primary follicles and an 
increase in the number of atretic follicles in the ovary.38
Cd and cardiovascular system
Cd can be stored in the heart, like kidney, liver. However, 
when compared to the kidney and liver, it has been 
reported that the concentration of Cd in the heart tissue is 
relatively low. In a study in rats, 50 ppm Cd+2 per day was 
applied to rats’ diets for 7 weeks. Studies have reported 
that Cd+2 accumulation occurs in cardiac tissues at ratios 
of 0.55-1.22 μg.39 Cd has effects on cardiac tissue. Two 
important hypotheses have been proposed regarding 
this topic: the effects of Cd on cardiac tissue structure 
and integrity and its effects on the cardiac conduction 
system.40 The first is based on increased reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) with increased oxidative stress 
and necrosis and ultrastructural changes in cells with 
increased ROS. The second is based on the interaction 
of Cd with contraction and acceleration systems.41,42 Cd 
has been shown to have the potential to serve as a new 
risk factor on the cardiovascular system, as demonstrated 
by in vitro animal studies and human studies.43 Studies 
show that Cd leads to metabolic and structural disorders 
in the heart and that it plays a role in the etiology of 
hypertension even at low concentrations.44-46 In a recent 
study, Cd content in serum, hair, and nails of patients with 
hypertensive and coronary heart disease was compared to 
those of a healthy control group, and as a result, it was 
reported that Cd content increased in various tissues of 
the patient group.47 Another study found that urinary Cd, 
the biological indicator of long-term Cd exposure, was 
associated with increased cardiovascular mortality and 
increased incidence of cardiovascular disease.48 These 
studies support that Cd exposure is a cardiovascular risk 
factor. However, there are also publications that show 
the opposite. Vivoli et al reported that urine and hair Cd 
contents in the hypertensive patient group were similar to 
those of normotensive individuals, but urinary Cd/copper 

Unsal et al
186 Advanced Pharmaceutical Bulletin, 2020, Volume 10, Issue 2
ratio was significantly lower in hypertensive patients.49
Cd causes atherosclerosis. It has been reported that the 
incidence of atherosclerosis is increased in people living 
in areas with Cd contamination. These findings may shed 
light on the etiology of atherosclerosis, which is common 
in smokers.50
There are various hypotheses on this subject. 
According to the information available, the dominant 
hypothesis explaining the effect of Cd on atherosclerosis 
is the “response to injury hypothesis” proposed by Ross. 
According to this hypothesis, it is a functional disorder 
that initiates primary endothelial damage and/or diseases. 
Cd reduces endothelial barrier function by causing 
degradation of endothelial cell-cell adhesions, and death 
of endothelial cells was demonstrated in vivo and in vitro.51
Cd and placenta
The placenta is a versatile organ that protects the fetus 
and plays an important role in its development and in 
placenta functions between mother and fetus during 
pregnancy. Some lesions developing on the placenta 
may adversely affect fetal life.52-54 In addition, it acts as a 
filter in reducing the passage of harmful substances and 
protects the embryo and then the fetus without exposure 
to contaminants.55 Cd can pass through the mother and 
to the fetus through the placenta.56-57 Human placenta is 
sensitive to toxic Cd activity. Experimental studies have 
shown the administration of Cd salts in the late period 
of pregnancy to cause placental damage. Early exposure 
to Cd in particular is thought to have an impact on baby 
health, such as neurological, developmental and endocrine 
disorders.55 Cd also affects endocrine hormone synthesis 
(eg, placental progesterone or leptin) and changes 
trophoblast cell migration.58 In one study, there was a 
significant negative correlation between the concentration 
of Cd in the cord blood and TSH concentration in the 
neonatal blood.59 In addition, Cd can damage the fetus by 
affecting the metabolism of elements such as zinc, copper, 
iron and selenium.14
Cd and brain
Cd enters the central nervous system either by smell or 
by altering the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. 
Cd causes neurotoxicity with complex pathology￾involving behavioral changes, brain biochemical defects, 
and neurological dysfunction.60 In the central nervous 
system, Cd causes oxidative stress and histologically 
observable membrane disorders due to the decrease of 
acetylcholinesterase activity, the increase of oxidative 
stress symptoms and the depletion of glutathione, 
superoxide dismutase and other antioxidants.61
Cd and kidney
The kidney is one of the major organs affected by different 
ways of exposure to Cd. Whether acute or chronic, it is 
adversely affected in all circumstances. In chronic Cd 
exposure, approximately 50% of the accumulated dose 
is stored in the kidneys.62,63 Acute toxicity occurs when 
too much Cd is inhaled or taken orally. Acute exposure 
rarely results in death. The exposure resulting in death 
is 20-30 mg/kg for humans.64,65 Exposure to Cd-oxide 
vapors at doses of 5 mg/m3
 for 8 hours has been reported 
to be lethal to humans.66 This stored amount represents 
the amount of Cd not bound to MT. The S-1 segment of 
the kidney proximal tubules is the main target site for Cd 
deposition. Cd inhibits reabsorption of protein, amino 
acid, glucose, bicarbonate and phosphate in the proximal 
tubules, resulting in tissue damage. It induces apoptosis 
in tubular cells, causing oxidative stresses in transport 
proteins and mitochondria.67,68 Cd disrupts vitamin D 
metabolism in the kidneys, causing a devastating effect 
on the bones. This effect causes absorption of calcium 
from the intestines and impairs collagen metabolism, 
thus resulting in osteomalacia and osteoporosis. The 
most important example of this is the Ittai Itai disease 
in Japan. Renal tubular dysfunction, impaired calcium 
absorption, anemia and osteomalacia cause severe pain 
in this disease.69,70 The earliest sign of kidney damage is 
the asset of low molecular weight proteins. These are B2 
microglobulin (b2M), retinol binding protein (RBP) and 
enzymes like N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NAG). 
Detection of b2M and RBP in urine provides information 
about impairment of proximal tubular cell function. 
Thus, the urinary RBP and b2M are defined as biological 
markers of proximal tubular dysfunction.64,71
Cd and endocrine system
Cd has adverse effects on the endocrine system. According 
to previous research, hormones are affected negatively.72,73
Endocrine disrupting chemicals are natural or synthetic 
agents that mimic, enhance or inhibit the effects of 
endogenous hormones, and recent reports suggest that 
Cd may be added to endocrine disrupting chemicals 
as it has the potential to mimic the estrogenic effects of 
various tissues.74,75 Jancic and Stosic reported that Cd 
tends to accumulate not only in the liver, kidneys, or other 
organs but also in the thyroid gland. They found that the 
concentration of Cd in the blood is positively correlated 
with accumulation in the thyroid gland.76 Chronic 
exposure to Cd causes many histological and metabolic 
changes in the thyroid gland.77 In a study, elevated blood 
levels of Cd have been associated with suppressed TSH 
production. However, the increase in Cd to urine ratio has 
also been correlated with increase in triiodothyronine (T3) 
and thyroxine (T4) serum levels.78 In a rat experiment, it 
was determined that Cd caused calcitonin, synaptophysin, 
chromogranin A and somatostatin secretion. Ca+2 levels 
in the serum decreased considerably in these animals. In 
addition, Cd may impair the metabolism of Ca, as well 
as other basic metals such as Zn, Se and iodine and the 
structure and function of thyroid follicular cells in female 
rats chronically exposed to Cd.76,79

Cadmium toxicity and natural antioxidants
Advanced Pharmaceutical Bulletin, 2020, Volume 10, Issue 2 187
Cd and liver 
The liver plays an important role in maintaining body 
homeostasis in living organisms. Plasma proteins have 
functional properties such as construction, regulation 
of blood composition, detoxification and hormone 
inactivation.80,81 The liver is the organ most affected by Cd 
through all exposure patterns. Cd-induced hepatotoxicity 
depends on the amount and duration of exposure. 
As in other tissues and organs, histopathological and 
metabolic changes occur in the liver, along with some 
histopathological changes such as loss of normal 
architecture of the parenchymatous tissue, cytoplasmic 
vacuolization, cellular degeneration and necrosis, 
congested blood vessels, destructed mitochondria 
cristae, fat globules, severe glycogen depletion, lipofuscin 
pigments, and collagenous fibers.82,83 These changes may 
result in both apoptosis and necrosis.83,84 Mitochondrial￾mediated apoptosis may be involved in metal-induced cell 
deaths. Hepatotoxicity is thought to be caused mainly by 
the binding of Cd to thiol groups in the mitochondria, 
leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and related injury.83 
Cd triggers a programmed creation of necrotic cell￾killing by the rupture of lysosomes.41 Increased serum 
concentrations of amino acids in the urea cycle have been 
reported in individuals exposed to Cd via diet. This is also 
an indication of kidney damage.85 
Plasma ALT, AST and GGT enzyme levels are known 
to be the most important indicators for evaluating the 
structural and functional status of liver tissue.86 Cd 
causes structural and functional impairment in cells by 
increasing lipid peroxidation. Cd also leads to an increase 
in blood enzyme levels by transferring these enzymes to 
the blood and disrupting the membrane permeability of 
the cells.87,88 Oxidation of lipids results in degradation of 
the membrane structure by degradation and crosslinking 
of polymerization.89
Cd and bone
 Recent studies have established a target for Cd in the bone 
even at low exposures, as in other tissues and organs.14,90 
Chronic Cd exposure is associated with bone loss, low bone 
mass, and an increase in fracture incidence. The function 
of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, and the cells associated with 
the bones that resemble the bone include development, 
repair, and skeletal renewal, respectively. Adult skeleton 
is interestingly dynamic, with the rebuilding of the bone 
in response to mechanical and metabolic demands. It 
is not known what effect Cd has on bone loss at the 
cellular level. Under comparable incubation conditions 
in organ and cell culture systems, bone resorption 
appears to be more sensitive than bone formation versus 
Cd exposure. Cd toxicity reduces phosphate uptake of 
Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) in bones and causes 
osteomalacia along with phosphaturia.91 FGF-23 plays 
an important role in balancing mineral ion homeostasis 
and bone mineralization.92 Cd is toxic to an osteoblast 
variety, MC3T3, by an unknown mechanism and activates 
osteoclasts and causes osteoporosis.93-94 In a study on rats, 
Cd has been reported to reduce serum osteocalcin levels.95
In children exposed to Cd ‘calciuria’, increased bone 
resorption and reduced bone mineral concentration have 
been observed.96 It has been reported that administration 
of Cd to rats at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg three times a week 
increased the risk of osteoporosis by reducing the 
biomechanical quality of the bone.97 In another animal 
study, single-dose oral Cd has been shown to increase 
calcium excretion in mice. Similar studies have shown 
that Cd destroys the collagen matrix and causes calcium 
to be released from bone to blood.98
Cd and hematopoiesis
Cd toxicity negatively affects hematopoiesis. Anemic 
hemolysis due to Cd toxicity has been observed. In fact, 
severe anemia was observed in patients with Itai-itai due 
to Cd toxicity, which is linked to significant suppression 
of erythropoietin production.99 Three mechanisms have 
been proposed to explain why Cd causes anemia.
1. Hemolysis due to deformities of peripheral red blood 
cells.100
2. When iron is absorbed in the duodenum, iron 
deficiency develops due to Cd competing with iron.101
3. Renal anemia due to hypo-production of 
erythropoietin99 along with these, at high doses, 
acute Cd has been shown to increase the rate of 
polychromatic erythrocytes by showing a genotoxic 
effect in bone marrow.101
Acute Cd toxicity also causes pial cerebral thrombosis 
by accelerating platelet aggregation.89
Cd and immune system
Cd exposure changes the immune system.102 It has been 
reported that Cd intoxication in the prenatal period 
disrupts T lymphocyte production and immunization 
in the postnatal period and causes abnormal thymocyte 
development.103,104 In rats receiving chronic Cd toxicity 
(40 mg/L/30 days), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), 
interleukin-1β, 6, 10 (IL-1β, 6, 10), peripheral neutrophil 
levels and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) increased, 
while lymphocyte counts decreased.105 In addition to 
autoimmune formation, lymphocyte proliferation and 
natural killer cell activity are also suppressed.106
Cd and lung
The lungs are among the target organs of Cd. Exposure 
to Cd dust or vapor by respiration irritates the respiratory 
tissues of humans. The most important source of 
inhalation Cd poisoning is cigarette smoke. Human lungs 
reabsorb more than almost half of the Cd (40-60%) in 
tobacco smoke.107 Male rats fed orally with CdCl2 for 10 
days showed a decrease in lung weight due to the dose. 
However, the same situation was not observed in female 
rats. Nonspecific pulmonary lesions were seen in male rats 

Unsal et al
188 Advanced Pharmaceutical Bulletin, 2020, Volume 10, Issue 2
fed with 1.2 mg/kg CdCl2 in water for 200 days.108 Cd may 
also contribute to asthma symptoms. Zn and Selenium 
(Se) can treat the clinical symptoms of asthma such as 
wheezing, coughing and lung function by competing with 
and removing Cd in children. Despite the limited number 
of studies showing that Cd has no association with lung 
cancer, recent studies have identified an increased risk of 
lung cancer in the population exposed to Cd.109,110 It has 
been reported that Cd levels in 24-hour urine are positively 
associated with both lung cancer and total cancer risk.
Cd and Cancer 
Cd is one of the most effective carcinogenic metals for 
humans. Chronic exposure to Cd causes lung, prostate, 
breast, pancreatic and renal cancer.69,111,112 The cellular and 
molecular mechanisms of the carcinogenic effect of Cd 
are given under six forms as below.110
1) Activation of proto-oncogenes.
2) Inactivation of tumor suppressor genes.
3) Deterioration of cell adhesion mechanism.
4) Induction of apoptosis.
5) Inhibition of DNA repair.
6) Free radical production and affecting the antioxidant 
system.
Cd promotes the expression of genes (such as c-myc, c-fos, 
and c-jun) that are members of the activator protein 1 (AP￾1) family of proto-oncogenes. In addition, with immediate 
early response genes, MT increases the expression of stress 
response genes that encode glutathione and heat shock 
proteins, suppresses the expression of antioxidant genes 
such as superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione 
peroxidase. Tumor suppressor proteins such as E-cadherin 
and VE-cadherin impair cell-cell adhesion.113-115
Cd and trace elements, metallothioneins 
Since Cd has toxicological properties, it can prevent the 
uptake, transport and use of many other elements.116 Se 
is a trace element with antioxidant effects based on the 
human body that shows oxygen-free radical cleaning, 
protects organs and tissues in the body from oxidative 
damage and improves the immune system of the 
body. Previous in vitro studies have shown Se to be a 
protective agent against Cd cytotoxicity by blocking ROS 
production. In addition, Se has been shown to stimulate 
antioxidant enzymes in the immature kidneys of rats 
exposed to Cd and to protect against oxidative damage.117
Zn plays a role in many cellular functions, catalytic 
functions of many enzymes and structural stability of 
various cell proteins. Zn also interacts in DNA/RNA 
binding by the regulation of transcription, chromatin 
structure, protein-protein interactions and RNA 
metabolism. It also has an important role in stabilization 
and protection of biological membranes against oxidative 
and peroxidative injuries, loss of plasma membrane 
integrity and change of membrane permeability. Zn 
supplementation at low concentrations has been shown 
to reduce Cd-induced oxidative stress.118 Another study 
reported Zn supplementation to be beneficial for the 
system against Cd toxicity.116 Environmentally essential 
toxic metal Cd is present as Cd+2 ion in biological systems 
and is chemically similar to Ca2+ in such cases. Both are 
bivalent and can enter cells through channels or protein￾bound penetration. Cd disrupts calcium homeostasis 
by inhibiting calcium channels and/or related proteins. 
Altered calcium homeostasis induced by Cd results in 
cell apoptosis, autophagy or tumorigenesis.119,120 Metals, 
hormones, cytokinins, various chemicals, inflammation, 
stress and hypoxia, necrosis factors and glucocorticoids 
induce synthesis of MTs.121 With their rich thiol groups, 
MTs are proteins involved in many physiological and 
pathological events, mainly antioxidant processes. They 
are involved in many important events, such as the 
detoxification of heavy metals such as Hg, Cd and lead 
(Pb), the regulation of essential metals such as Cu and Zn, 
antioxidant action against oxygen radicals and protection 
against DNA damage, maintenance of cell viability, 
angiogenesis, apoptosis and proliferation functions.122 
MTs are thought to play a role in the homeostasis of 
essential metals such as Zn, Cu and Fe. MTs binds Zn, but 
Zn can easily be replaced with excess Cu, Fe or Cd.123 MTs 
are zinc-containing proteins consisting of 33% cysteine 
amino acid. MTs protect tissues from the toxic effects of 
heavy metals that have toxic effects in biological systems 
such as Cd and Hg. While MT has minimal effects on the 
absorption of Cd from the intestine, it plays an important 
role in Cd retention in tissues and reduces the excretion 
of Cd into bile. Excessive amounts of MT-containing cells 
are resistant to and are protective against Cd toxicity.124-126 
Oxidative stress
Oxidative stress occurs when the balance between ROS 
and the antioxidant system is impaired in the oxidant 
direction. Oxidative stress is a natural process, and there 
are specialized mechanisms that control this stress. 
Oxidative damage occurs when these mechanisms are 
inadequate.127 The cellular and molecular mechanisms 
of Cd can be categorized as follows: inactivation of 
tumor suppressor genes, deterioration of cell adhesion 
mechanism, triggering of apoptosis, suppression of DNA 
repair, free radical production and effect on antioxidant 
systems.32,33 Most of the damage caused by toxic metals is 
due to the increase in the free radicals they cause. ROS 
can lead to oxidative stress within cells by reacting with 
macromolecules and causing damages. These damages are 
in the form of increased lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, 
and oxidation of proteins.83
ROS
ROS production plays an important role in Cd toxicity, 
and various suggestions have been put forward in this 
regard. It has been suggested that acute Cd toxicity 
mechanisms involve the depletion of glutathione and 

Cadmium toxicity and natural antioxidants
Advanced Pharmaceutical Bulletin, 2020, Volume 10, Issue 2 189
protein-bound sulfhydryl groups, resulting in increased 
production of ROS such as superoxide ion, hydrogen 
peroxide and hydroxyl radicals. Cd-enhanced ROS causes 
lipid peroxidation and results in DNA damage. Another 
suggestion is that mitochondria are an important target 
of Cd toxicity. It has been suggested that Cd initially 
binds to protein thiols in the mitochondrial membrane, 
affects mitochondrial permeability transmission, inhibits 
respiratory chain reaction and then produces ROS. Cancer, 
diabetes, atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases and 
many other diseases play a role in the pathogenesis of 
ROS. For this reason, it is one of the most studied topics 
in recent years. ROS is a non-stable, highly effective atom 
or molecule having one or more unpaired electrons. 
Free radicals are produced according to endogenous or 
exogenous factors.127-129
Potential endogenous sources of ROS
Mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, cytochrome 
P-450, peroxisomes, microsomes, and inflammatory cell 
activation are potential sources of ROS. Mitochondria 
are the main source of superoxide (O2
.–) in the body. For 
each mg of protein, it produces 2-3 mol O2 per minute 
while also producing H2
O2
. When cytochrome P450 is 
induced, it specifically produces O2
- and H2
O2
. Xanthine 
oxidase (XO), NADPH oxidase, lipoxygenase and other 
oxidant enzymes are important ROS sources. The ROS 
family includes short-lived molecules that result from the 
reduction of molecular oxygen. The most common ROS 
are H2
O2
, O2
.– and OH⁻.
130,131
Potential exogenous sources of ROS 
• Antineoplastic agents: Doxorubicin, an 
anticarcinogenic agent, inhibits DNA replication in 
the cell. This leads to the formation of H2
O2
 and O2
- 
and ultimately the initiation of lipid peroxidation.
• Radiation and environmental agents [air pollution, 
heavy metals, pesticides, cigarette smoke, solvents, 
anesthetics, aromatic hydrocarbons, Carbon 
tetrachloride (CCl4), Iron nitrilotriacetate (Fe￾NTA)] cause free radical formation.132,133
• Habitual substances: Alcohol and narcotics.
• Environmental agents: Xenobiotics (air polluting 
photo chemicals, hyperoxia, pesticides, cigarette 
smoke, solvents, anesthetic substances, aromatic 
hydrocarbons).
• Stress: The level of catecholamine increases in stress. 
Oxidation of catecholamines is a source of free 
radicals. 
• Ischemia, trauma.134
ROS attack protein and enzymes, carbohydrates, and 
DNA in the cell membrane lipids, causing DNA damage, 
as well as protein modification131 (Figure 1).
Antioxidant defence system
Antioxidants and ROS penetrate the whole of life and 
constitute the field of redox biology. The antioxidant 
system prevents radical formation before damage, repairs 
the oxidative damage, cleans the damaged molecules and 
prevents mutations.135,136 Two different mechanisms play 
an active role against free radical damage. The first is the 
non-enzymatic nutritional mechanism, and the other is the 
enzymatic mechanism (Figure 2). In the non-enzymatic 
feeding mechanism, glutathione (GSH) is present in some 
trace elements as well as low molecular weight molecules 
such as vitamin E, vitamin C, beta-carotene and vitamin 
A. Vitamins act as the carrier or silent receptors of free 
radicals, whereas trace elements regulate the activities of 
antioxidant enzymes.127 Antioxidant defense systems of 
the human body are complex and are classified in various 
forms. The final classification involves their functions, 
their place in the cell, the structure they protect, their 
solubility and their source.
Superoxide dismutase (SOD) 
SOD is the most important enzyme that protects against 
O2
.– radicals. SOD catalyzes the conversion of superoxide 
Figure 1. Demonstration of the relationship between ROS and antioxidants. 
Oxidative stress occurs when the balance between ROS and the antioxidant 
system is impaired in the oxidant direction. ROS affect all important structures 
such as carbohydrates, lipids, Nucleic acids and enzymes. Cd: Cadmium, 
ROS: Reactive oxygen species.
Figure 2. There are two types of the antioxidant defense systems. The first 
is the enzymatic antioxidant system, and the other is the nonenzymatic 
antioxidant system. Both serve as shields against the harmful effects of Cd.

to oxygen and hydrogen peroxides. The SOD enzyme 
family is named according to the cofactors used to detoxify 
the excess of O2
.– such as Cu/Zn-SOD, Fe-SOD, Ni-SOD 
and Mn-SOD. It is defined as metalloenzymes because 
it contains metals. Cu/Zn-SOD is in a dimeric form 
and is found in cytosol, with Cu and Zn bound to two 
subunits. SOD is usually found in the mitochondria and 
is tetrameric.135,136 The presence of specific SOD isoforms 
in different subcellular compartments emphasizes the 
need for tight control of ROS homeostasis.137-139 The role 
of SOD has been recognized as an important factor in 
oxidative stress caused by Cd. It has been shown in in vivo 
and in vitro studies that Cd reduces SOD activity. SOD 
with no activity or decreased activity causes an increase of 
ROS.139 SOD activities have been reported to decrease in 
the liver and kidneys of rats that were sacrificed 24 hours 
after a single dose of 2.5 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg Cd.140
Catalase (CAT)
CAT is a potent antioxidant enzyme in protein structure. 
CAT is a hemoprotein with four heme groups in its 
structure. The molecular weight of hemoprotein CAT 
is 248 kDa.141 The most important task of CAT is to 
remove toxic H2
O2
 from cells. CAT, an enzyme found in 
plants, animals and aerobic bacteria, is found mostly in 
peroxisomes in the cell. A molecule CAT can convert 6 
million hydrogen peroxide molecules per minute into 
water and oxygen. It has high activity in erythrocytes, 
kidney and liver. In vivo and in vitro studies have shown 
that CAT activity changes in the negative direction due to 
interaction with Cd.142
Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px)
The GSH-Px enzyme is key in the living organism 
antioxidant system under both normal and oxidative 
stress conditions. GSH-Px has great important defenses 
against free oxygen radicals, peroxides and carcinogens. 
GSH-Px also plays an important role in inhibiting tumor 
formation by altering the lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase 
pathways. In tumors, enzyme defense against H2
O2
 and 
other peroxides have been reported to cause significant 
increase in GSH-Px activity, the first enzyme.131 The GSH￾Px enzyme, which catalyzes the reduction of peroxides, 
converts reduced GSH to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in 
the cell. It has been reported that there are 8 GSH-Px in the 
human organism, and it is called selenoproteins (Se GPxs), 
which are seen in many different cell types. Only GSH￾Px-4, GSH-Px-7 and GSH-Px-8 are monomeric, while the 
others are tetrameric. GSH-Px can be found in two forms: 
selenium-bound and not selenium-bound. The selenium￾bound group consists of four members that reduce 
hydrogen peroxide and other organic peroxides. These are 
GSH-Px1, GSH-Px2, GSH-Px3 and GSHPx4.143 GSH-Px1 
or cellular GSH-Px (cGSH-Px) is a cytosolic enzyme in the 
tetrameric structure found in all cells. GSH-Px1 is active 
against organic hydroperoxides and H2
O2
. This enzyme 
has been found in all tissues studied, albeit much less in 
germ cells.144 GSH-Px 2 or gastrointestinal GSH-Px (GSH￾Px-GI) is found in the liver and gastrointestinal tract in 
humans, but not found in the kidney, heart and lung.145
GSH-Px 3 or plasma GSH-Px (pGSH-Px) are 
found in the kidneys and are especially present in the 
epithelial cells of proximal tubules.143 GSH-Px4 or 
phospholipid GSH-Px (PH-GSH-Px) is found in cytosol, 
mitochondria and cell membrane. The enzyme reduces 
the phospholipid hydroperoxides to alcohols and protects 
the membrane against peroxidation in the absence of the 
most important antioxidant vitamin E.146 Cd decreases 
GSH-Px activity in induced cells. The reduced activity 
of GSH-Px can be explained by the sulfur competition 
of Cd-metallothionines and GSH-Px containing amino 
acids.147,148
Glutathione reductase (GR)
GR is responsible for providing reduced glutathione. 
It is one of the most abundant thiols in most cells. In 
its reduced form, glutathione plays an important role 
in the cellular control of ROS.146 It is involved in the re￾conversion of GSSG into reduced GSH by the reducing 
power of NADPH.148
Glutathione S-transferase (GST)
GST is a multifunctional enzyme that provides 
homeostasis in the detoxification metabolic pathway by 
catalyzing the first step in the formation of the water￾soluble end product mercapturic acid. GST enzymes are 
a multifunctional polymorphic isoenzyme family that 
protect the cell from cytotoxic and genotoxic stresses.149
The most common tissues of the GST are the liver, 
especially organs such as kidney, small intestine, intestine, 
lung and breast. The basic biological roles of GSTs include 
detoxification and protection against oxidative stress. GSTs 
have four families: cytosolic, mitochondrial, microsomal/
membrane-associated and fosfomycin/glyoxalase. There 
are 17 different cytosolic GSTs divided into 7 classes 
(alpha, mI, omega, phi, sigma, theta and zeta) based on 
sequence similarity in humans.150
Non-enzymatic antioxidants
• Those in the lipid phase (α-tocopherol, β-carotene)
• Those found in a liquid phase (cell cytosol or blood 
plasma) (ascorbic acid, urate, cysteine, ceruloplasmin, 
transferrin, lactoferrin, myoglobin, hemoglobin, 
ferritin, albumin, bilirubin, glutathione)
• Those present in both liquid and lipid phase 
(melatonin).
Glutathione 
GSH is a tripeptide with a nucleophilic structure and 
strong antioxidant properties. The glutathione system acts 
as the major redox buffer in most cells. Decreased GSH 
in tissues can lead to peroxidative tissue damage with the 

Cadmium toxicity and natural antioxidants
Advanced Pharmaceutical Bulletin, 2020, Volume 10, Issue 2 191
deterioration of the cellular defense mechanism against 
ROS. In addition, glutathione has a key role in protecting 
against xenobiotics and heavy metals such as Cd.151-153
Vitamin E
Vitamin E is a vitamin type that has a high level of 
antioxidant potency and is soluble in oil. Vitamin E has eight 
isoforms, α-, β-, γ-, and δ-tocopherol and α-, β-, γ-, and 
δ-tocotrienol stereoisomers including α, β, γ, δ tocopherol 
and α, β, γ, δ tocotrienol. Among these stereoisomers, the 
most biologically active is α-tocopherol.154,155 The most 
important property of alpha-tocopherol is its ability to 
protect against lipid peroxidation and to protect the cell 
membrane from degenerative effects of free radicals. 
Vitamin E has been reported to be protective against 
colon and prostate cancer, some cardiovascular diseases, 
ischemia, cataract, arthritis and neurological diseases as 
a result of the studies done.154 In vivo studies have shown 
that Vitamin E is protective against Cd toxicity and 
reduces oxidative damage.155,156
β–Carotene
Carotene is a chemical terpene with two main types: alpha￾carotene (α-carotene) and beta-carotene (β-carotene). 
There are also gamma, delta and epsilon- (γ, δ and ε-) 
carotenes.
β-carotene is most commonly available in green fruits 
and vegetables. β-carotene is particularly abundant in 
carrots.157 Being a good antioxidant, it has an important 
effect in eliminating harmful free radicals. In many studies, 
β-carotene has been shown to reduce oxidative stress 
damage and to play a protective role against oxidative 
stress.157,158 Studies have shown β-carotene to reduce 
oxidative stress caused by Cd-induced brain and testicular 
toxicity and to improve the loss of cellular antioxidants in 
these tissues.159,160
Melatonin
Melatonin is a neurohormone that is synthesized and 
secreted by the retina, bone marrow, thymus, ovary and 
gastrointestinal tract, primarily the pineal gland.161 In the 
skin, it is responsible for the protection of deep tissues 
against the harmful radiation effects of sun rays and the 
exchange of pigment granules. On the other hand, it plays 
a role in the protection of oxidative cholesterol derivatives 
and bile acid to oxidative damage to the bile and mucous 
membranes.162 Since melatonin can be dissolved in both 
liquid and lipid phases, it can easily reach all intracellular 
components and effectively protect the cell membrane, 
organelles and nucleus from free radical damage. It also 
reduces the production of radicals such as O2
, H2
O2
 and 
OH⁻ that occur in mitochondrial respiration. Its ability 
to reach the core ensures that DNA is protected against 
oxidative damage.163 There are in vitro studies suggesting 
that melatonin has protective effects on Cd-induced 
cancer cell proliferation. Furthermore, in vivo studies have 
shown that melatonin reduces the toxic effects of Cd.84,164
α-Lipoic acid (ALA)
ALA is a small molecule that contains a thiol group and 
has antioxidant activity. It is efficient in both lipophilic 
and hydrophilic environments. Although ALA is found 
in human diet in sufficient quantities, mitochondria are 
synthesized de novo by lipoic acid synthase. ALA is found 
in two forms as oxides and dihydrolipoic acid as in its 
reduced form. Although both forms are active, it is stated 
that the most active form is dihydrolipoic acid. However, 
both forms are antioxidant. In addition to the antioxidant 
effects that ALA possesses, it strengthens and renews 
the intracellular levels of other antioxidants (vitamins C, 
E, GSH, etc). Because an antioxidant neutralizes its free 
radical, it loses its antioxidant property. Studies have 
shown that treatment with ALA leads to modulatory 
effects in Cd toxicity and reduces Cd destructive effects, 
leading to marked reductions in Cd residues in the liver 
and kidneys. In conclusion, it is claimed that ALA may be 
used as a potential therapeutic agent against Cd-induced 
toxicity.165-167
Flavonoids
Flavonoids are a large group of polyphenolic compounds 
found in plant foods consumed regularly (i.e. vegetables and 
fruits), olive oil and drinks such as tea and wine. Flavonoids 
are known as phenylpropanoids with important chelating 
and antioxidant properties and are generally found in 
plants and cannot be synthesized in the human organism. 
Flavonoids are classified as flavones (grapes, French 
bean seeds, rice bran, vetch), flavonols (quercetin, rutin, 
strawberries, apples, persimmons, onions, cucumbers), 
flavanones (lemons, rosehips, bitter orange, petit grain, 
orange, orange juice) flavanonols (vinegar), flavanols or 
catechins (tea leaves, black tea, oolong tea), anthocyanins 
(cranberries, blueberries, plums, grapes, cherries, sweet 
potatoes) and chalcones. It has been found that flavonoids 
have different properties such as antiviral, antiallergic, 
antitumor, anticholinesterase, antithrombotic, anti￾inflammatory and vasodilating effects besides antioxidant 
properties. Flavonoids provide protection against damage 
caused by Cd with these effects.168,169 The cytoprotective 
effects of flavonoids against Cd-induced diseases have 
been explained through specific mechanisms. First, they 
clean the ROS of flavonoids, reducing lipid peroxide 
production and increasing the activity of antioxidation 
enzymes. Second, they chelate Cd, reducing Cd deposition 
and altering in vivo levels of other basic metal ions. Third, 
they reduce DNA damage and prevent apoptosis.170
Curcumin
Curcumin is a hydrophobic polyphenol compound 
used as a yellow spice for years and is obtained from 
turmeric. Curcumin has antioxidant, antimicrobial, 
anti-inflammatory, antiviral, anti-carcinogenic and 

Unsal et al
192 Advanced Pharmaceutical Bulletin, 2020, Volume 10, Issue 2
antiapoptotic properties.171 It has been shown to be an 
important agent against Cd-induced hepatotoxicity, 
immunotoxicity, lung diseases, reproductive toxicity, 
neurotoxicity, colon toxicity and nephrotoxicity.172
Antioxidant effect
Curcumin exhibits potent antioxidant activity comparable 
to vitamins E and C. The antioxidant effect comes from its 
phenolic structure and β-diketone derivative. Curcumin 
has been shown to inhibit lipid peroxidation, H2
O2
 and 
enhance the activity of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, GST, 
and GPx).173,174
Anticancer effect
In vivo and in vitro studies have shown curcumin to 
have an inhibitory effect in three steps of carcinogenesis: 
tumor increase, angiogenesis and tumor growth. It has 
been shown to protect against tumors in many animal 
studies. This protection has been shown in colon, prostate, 
duodenum, esophagus, stomach and oral cancers.175
Anti-inflammatory effect
Various studies have shown that curcumin modulates 
the production of a variety of inflammatory cytokines 
and thus exhibits a potent anti-inflammatory activity. In 
addition, it has an inhibitory effect on proinflammatory 
cytokines TNF-α and IL-6, which are inflammatory 
process inhibitors caused by Cd poisoning.176
Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)
CoQ10 is a vitamin-like compound that can dissolve in 
oil, can exist in all cells and acts as a coenzyme during 
key enzymatic interaction in forming energy in the cell. 
The chemical formula of CoQ10 consists of 5-ethyl￾2.3-dimethoxy-6-decaprenyl-1.4-benzoquinone. It is 
synthesized from phenylalanine and mevalonic acid 
endogenously in the body. The majority of CoQ10 in 
cell membranes is a reduced form (KoQH2) and is 
found near the unsaturated lipid chains in membranes. 
CoQ10 interacts with ROS to prevent protein and lipid 
peroxidation from initiating and damaging biomolecules. 
CoQ10 (also known as ubiquinone), an important 
electron carrier in cellular respiration, exhibits antioxidant 
properties by removing ROS and protecting oxidative 
stress cells. The mitochondrial respiratory chain acts 
as the electron. In addition, the membrane stability of 
CoQ10 also functions in cell signaling, gene formation, 
cell growth and apoptosis protection.177-179 
In Cd poisoning study; Cd caused significant changes in 
hematological and biochemical parameters and increased 
lipid peroxidation, altered the glutathione circuit and 
decreased the activity of antioxidant enzymes. CoQ10 
provided protection by substantially normalizing these 
values and reducing lipid peroxidation. The results of 
this study showed that CoQ10 may be useful in the 
prevention of Cd-induced hepatotoxicity and can be used 
as a preventive against acute Cd poisoning of exposed 
persons.180
N-Acetyl cysteine (NAC)
NAC is an N-acetylated derivative of a thiol molecule 
L-Cysteine, a natural amino acid. Its chemical formula 
is C5H9NO3S, and it has a molecular weight of 163.2 
g/mol. Acetylcysteine is a mucolytic that reduces the 
viscosity of secretions. The drug can be administered 
orally, intravenously or by the respiratory route. NAC 
is used intravenously in the treatment of paracetamol 
(acetaminophen) poisoning, while it is used as the second 
choice in acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile poisoning. It 
has begun to be used in some psychiatric and physiological 
diseases due to the demonstration of its antioxidant 
properties. NAC is very effective in neutralizing free 
radicals in vitro. NAC reacts rapidly with hydroxyl 
radicals. It is also effective against other ROS such as 
O2
•– and H2
O2
. It increases SOD activity and GSH levels 
and inhibits autocatalytic lipid peroxidation. One study 
showed NAC to improve Cd-induced neurotoxicity and 
improve memory and learning processes of Cd-poisoned 
rats.181,182
Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE)
CAPE is an active component with a flavonoid-like 
structure found in propolis produced by honey bees and 
has anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, hepatoprotective, 
immunomodulatory, antiviral, anticancer, antioxidant 
and apoptosis-regulating properties.183,184 More than 180 
substances were found in the structure of propolis. Among 
these components, flavonoids, caffeic acid and esters are 
the most dense and active constituents. CAPE can also 
be chemically synthesized as a result of esterification of 
caffeic acid and phenethyl alcohol with acid.183-187 CAPE 
consists of two ring structures. In these rings, there are 
two functional OH groups that carry almost all the 
chemical properties of the molecule, and they actively 
play a role in oxidation and reduction. The aromatic 
and aliphatic structure has a lipophilic character for 
carrying very long carbon groups. It is a potent inhibitor 
of enzymes such as ornithine carboxylase, 5-α reductase, 
protease, cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, xanthine oxidase 
and HIV-1 integrase. In one study, pretreatment with 
CAPE improved all changes caused by Cd. The results 
of this study showed CAPE to play a promising role as 
a mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant against the renal 
toxicity of Cd.184,188
Resveratrol
Resveratrol is one of the most widely studied 
phytochemicals with beneficial effects on human health. 
In recent years, pharmacological effects of resveratrol in 
relation to cardiovascular health, diabetes, aging, obesity 
and cancer have been demonstrated by various biochemical 
mechanisms in preclinical models.189 Resveratrol has been 

Cadmium toxicity and natural antioxidants
Advanced Pharmaceutical Bulletin, 2020, Volume 10, Issue 2 193
reported to play an antiproliferative role on various types 
of cancer such as breast, lung, prostate, colorectal and 
stomach cancer, esophageal tumors, pancreatic cancer 
and leukemia. The anti-cancer activity of resveratrol 
is mediated through the modulation of various cell￾signaling molecules that regulate the cell cycle process, 
proliferation, apoptosis, metastasis, angiogenesis and 
invasion of cancer cells.190,191 There are studies showing 
that resveratrol inhibits tumor growth in cancerous cells 
by inhibiting NF-κB activation and decreasing TNF-α 
production.192
Resveratrol has different mechanisms of antioxidant 
effect. Resveratrol shows an antioxidant potential by 
eliminating free radicals, binding metal ions, reducing 
the activity of enzymes involved in ROS formation and 
increasing antioxidant enzyme activities.193,194 Resveratrol 
inhibits lipid peroxidation caused by free radicals 
and prevents DNA damage. It has been reported that 
resveratrol lipid peroxidation is more effective when 
compared to vitamins E and C in prevention and that it 
maintains cell viability and inhibits oxidation by targeting 
molecules in the cell.195 Resveratrol has been shown to 
improve the renal oxidative damage caused by Cd.196 In 
addition, in another study, resveratrol has been shown to 
have a protective role in the amelioration of mitochondrial 
health through Sirt3-dependent FoxO3a.197
Quercetin
Quercetin contains three rings and five hydroxyl groups in 
its structure. Taken at a daily dose of 50-500 mg, quercetin 
has many important functions for metabolism such as 
antioxidant, anticancerogenic, antiviral, antithrombotic, 
anti-ischemic, anti-inflammatory and antiallergic 
properties. Quercetin is known as the most powerful 
antioxidant substance in flavonoids. Quercetin protects 
the cells against endogenous and exogenous ROS tissue 
damage.198,199
Quercetin has been reported to have different 
mechanisms of action on ROS. 
• It exhibits strong antiradical properties against 
radicals such as hydroxyl radical, peroxide and 
superoxide anion. 
• It reduces superoxide anion production with xanthine 
oxidase.
• Cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibit enzyme 
activities.
• It forms a chelate with metals such as iron and 
copper.198
There are quercetin applications for Cd toxicity to 
remove oxidative stress and degenerative disorders that 
occur in various tissues and organs of the body. Quercetin 
has been shown to prevent renal tubular damage and 
oxidative stress in rats exposed to chronic Cd. In another 
study, it was observed that Quercetin alleviated liver 
damage and oxidative stress in Cd-induced liver damage. 
Unsal et al suggested that Quercetin exhibited a significant 
protective action against Cd-induced neurotoxicity in rats 
via inhibiting lipid peroxidation.199-204
Studies have shown that antioxidants reduce Cd toxicity 
(Table 1).
Conclusion and Future Perspective
Cd exposure is present in many stages of human life and 
has become a global problem. Cd affects skeletal, urinal, 
reproductive, cardiovascular, central and peripheral 
nerves and respiratory system in human body. If it is 
almost impossible to escape from Cd in the industrialized 
world, then we must find ways to remove heavy metals 
like Cd from the body. The most commonly used agent 
in Cd poisoning is EDTA. In addition, chelators such as 
penicillamine, dimercaprol (British anti-Lewisite, BAL) 
and dithiocarbamates are used. BAL is more toxic than 
its derivatives, DMPS and DMSA, and is rarely used 
clinically.222,223 The antioxidant balance of the body is 
greatly influenced by the diet. Pathological conditions 
can occur when the defenses of the body are destroyed 
due to nutritional deficiencies. Cd increases the ROS 
level and causes oxidative stress.The increase in ROS and 
inadequacy of defense systems cause the deterioration 
of antioxidant balance in the body and the formation of 
“oxidative stress” conditions. Antioxidants interact with 
free radicals, rendering them ineffective and preventing 
damage. They are also known as free radical scavengers. 
To neutralize free radicals, the body produces some 
endogenous antioxidants. However, there are also 
exogenous antioxidants taken with nutrition. Fruits, 
vegetables and some medical plants are rich sources of 
antioxidants. It has been reported that the toxic effects 
of Cd can be protected through antioxidants. Many 
antioxidant substances have been tested to minimize 
the oxidative stress that occurs in tissues due to Cd. The 
reason researchers conduct antioxidant trials is that they 
appear purer and more reliable. As a result of our research, 
we found that some antioxidants decreased Cd-induced 
oxidative stress. However, to elucidate future therapeutic 
advances, new efforts are needed to remove Cd and reduce 
oxidative damage, particularly to obtain appropriate doses 
and more understandable results.
