Abstract
The wild species Solanum habrochaites is more cold tolerant than the cultivated tomato (S. lycopersicum). To explore the
mechanisms underlying cold tolerance of S. habrochaites, seedlings of S. habrochaites LA1777 introgression lines (ILs), as
well as the two parents, were evaluated under low temperature (4uC). The IL LA3969 and its donor parent LA1777 were
found to be more cold tolerant than the recurrent parent S. lycopersicum LA4024. The differences in physiology and global
gene expression between cold-tolerant (LA1777 and LA3969) and -sensitive (LA4024) genotypes under cold stress were
further investigated. Comparative transcriptome analysis identified 1613, 1456, and 1523 cold-responsive genes in LA1777,
LA3969, and LA4024, respectively. Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis revealed that more GO biological process
terms were significantly enriched among the up-regulated genes in the two tolerant genotypes, whereas more biological
processes were significantly repressed by cold stress in the sensitive one. A total of 92 genes with significant differential
expression between tolerant and sensitive genotypes under cold stress were identified. Among these, many stress-related
GO terms were significantly enriched, such as ‘response to stimulus’ and ‘response to stress’. Moreover, GO terms ‘response
to hormone stimulus’, ‘response to reactive oxygen species (ROS)’, and ‘calcium-mediated signaling’ were also
overrepresented. Several transcripts involved in hormone or ROS homeostasis were also differentially expressed. ROS,
hormones, and calcium as signaling molecules may play important roles in regulating gene expression in response to cold
stress. Moreover, the expression of various transcription factors, post-translational proteins, metabolic enzymes, and
photosynthesis-related genes was also specifically modulated. These specific modifications may play pivotal roles in
conferring cold tolerance in tomato. These results not only provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of cold
tolerance in tomato, but also provide potential candidate genes for genetic improvement.

Introduction
Low temperature is one of the key limiting factors that affect
plant distribution, growth, development, production, and
survival. Plants from temperate regions can increase freezing
tolerance by cold acclimation [1,2]. By contrast, plants from
tropical regions, such as rice, maize, and tomato, are unable to
cold acclimate and are sensitive to chilling temperatures (0 to
12uC) [3]. The cultivated tomato (S. lycopersicum) suffers from
chilling injury at all stages of plant growth and development,
including seed germination, growth, and fruit set. By contrast,
the wild species S. habrochaites grows well at chilling temperatures
and has been proposed as a potential germplasm resource of
cold tolerance in tomato breeding [4–6]. In the past decade,
many physiological responses to cold stress were comparatively
analyzed between S. habrochaites and S. lycopersicum, for review see
[5]. Although several hypotheses have been proposed to explain
tolerance or sensitivity to chilling in plants, the physiological
mechanisms responsible for cold tolerance remain unclear [7].
The C-repeat binding factor (CBF) cold response pathway is
currently the best documented genetic system that plays a pivotal
role in gene regulation during cold acclimation [2,8]. Exposing
Arabidopsis plants to low temperatures results in the rapid induction
of CBF genes [9]. CBFs can bind to the CRT/DRE regulatory
element in the promoters of many cold-inducible genes and
activate their expression [2,9,10]. Global transcriptome analysis
revealed that approximately 12% of cold-regulated genes are
controlled by the CBFs in Arabidopsis [11]. Tomato also has
a complete CBF cold response pathway, but its CBF regulon
differs from that of Arabidopsis and appears to be considerably
smaller and less diverse in function [3]. The CBF cold response
pathway in tomato is not as important as in cold-acclimated plants.
Several studies have explored the genetic basis of cold tolerance
in S. habrochaites. Vallejos and Tanksley identified three quantita￾tive trait loci (QTLs) for the plastochron index at low temperatures
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 November 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 11 | e50785

using a BC1 population derived from cold-sensitive S. lycopersicum
cv. T3 and a cold-tolerant S. habrochaites [12]. In another study,
several QTLs associated with shoot wilting and root ammonium
uptake under low temperatures were identified in a S. lycopersicum
6 S. habrochaites BC1 population [13]. A major-effect QTL for
shoot turgor maintenance under root chilling stress was then fine
mapped to a 2.7 cM region between markers T1670 and T1673
on chromosome 9 [7]. Meanwhile, an IL population of S.
habrochaites LA1777 was developed by Monforte and Tanksley
[14]. This IL population represents more than 85% of the genome
of S. habrochaites LA1777 in the genetic background of S. lycopersicum
LA4024. This IL population provides a valuable resource for
exploring QTLs/genes involved in cold tolerance in tomato.
Transcriptome analysis using microarray has been widely used
to investigate global gene expression in response to abiotic stress.
Transcriptional profiling under cold stress has been carried out in
different plant species, such as Arabidopsis [11,15], rice [16,17], and
barley [18,19]. In tomato, transcriptome analysis has been used to
compare patterns of gene expression under salt or drought stress
[20–22]. However, to the best of our knowledge, comparative
transcriptome analysis of cold-tolerant and -sensitive tomato under
cold stress is yet to be reported.
In this study, the IL LA3969 and its donor parent LA1777 were
found to be more tolerant to cold stress than the recurrent parent
S. lycopersicum LA4024 under cold stress. To explore the differences
in gene expression between cold-tolerant and -sensitive tomato
genotypes under cold stress, the gene expression profiles of the two
tolerant genotypes (LA1777 and LA3969) and the cold-sensitive
recurrent parent (LA4024) were comparatively analyzed. The
results presented here provide new insights into the molecular
mechanisms underlying the cold tolerance of the wild tomato S.
habrochaites.
Materials and Methods
Plant Materials and Cold Stress Treatment
Seeds of 93 ILs as well as their two parents, S. lycopersicum
LA4024 and S. habrochaites LA1777, were kindly supplied by
Tomato Genetics Research Center (University of California,
Davis, USA). Most of the lines contain a single defined
introgression from LA1777 in the genetic background of
LA4024 [14]. All the seeds were surface-sterilized and then sown
individually in 10 cm diameter plastic pots containing peat,
vermiculite and soil (v/v/v = 1:1:1). The seedlings were grown in
temperature regimes of 24–28uC day/20–25uC night and relative
humidity of 70–80% under natural light in a greenhouse. Six-week￾old seedlings were used for cold stress treatments.
To screen cold-tolerant ILs, uniform-sized plants were selected
and transferred into a cold chamber with a temperature of 4uC,
a 16 h photoperiod (irradiation intensity 120 mmol m–2s
–1), and
70% to 80% relative humidity. Three replicates were used for each
IL, with nine plants per replicate. In the first round of screening,
22 ILs that exhibited less severe wilting than the recurrent parent
LA4024 after 3 d of chilling stress were identified as putative cold￾tolerant lines. These selected ILs and the two parents were further
analyzed. After two weeks of chilling stress and then one week of
recovery, the survival rates of these ILs were recorded.
For physiological and microarray analysis, uniform seedlings of
the selected line LA3969 and the two parents were used. The cold
stress treatment was conducted as described above. Seedlings of
the control group were grown at 25uC. The second and third
leaves were sampled after 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 d of treatment. The leaf
samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at
280uC until use. Three independent biological samples for each
treatment were harvested, and each replicate contained 15 plants.
Measurements of Electrolyte Leakage, Lipid Peroxidation,
Proline and Total Soluble Sugars
Relative electrolyte leakage and lipid peroxidation were used to
evaluate the cell membrane damage. Lipid peroxidation was
estimated by determining malondialdehyde (MDA) content.
Relative electrolyte leakage of leaf discs and MDA content were
determined as described by Campos et al. [23]. Levels of free
proline were measured according to the method described by
Zhang et al. [24]. Total soluble sugar content was analyzed using
the anthrone method, with glucose as the standard [25].
Measurement of Chlorophyll Fluorescence Parameters
Chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of the third leaves were
measured at different time points after the treatment using a pulse￾modulated fluorometer (FMS-2, Hansatech, UK) according to the
method described by Wingler et al. [26]. The maximum quantum
efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry was calculated
as Fv/Fm=(Fm-F0)/Fm. The quantum yield of PSII electron
transport, WPSII was calculated as WPSII = (F’m-Fs)/F’m.
Histochemical Detection of ROS
Histochemical staining of superoxide radical (O2
-
) and hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2) was performed as previously described by Xia
et al. [27] with minor modifications. The terminal leaflets of the
first fully expanded leaf from six-week-old seedlings treated at 4uC
for 0, 1, and 3 d were used for staining. To detect the presence of
O2
-
, the leaflets were vacuum infiltrated in 50 mM potassium
phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) containing 0.1 mg mL21 nitroblue
tetrazolium (NBT) and incubated at 25uC in the dark for 2 h. To
detect the presence of H2O2, the leaflets were vacuum infiltrated
in 1 mg mL21 diaminobenzidine (DAB) in 50 mM Tris-acetate
(pH 3.8) and incubated at 25uC in the dark for 8 h. To remove
chlorophylls, the stained samples were transferred to 80% ethanol
and incubated at 70uC for 10 min. Images were taken with a digital
camera.
Enzyme Extraction and Assay
Tomato leaves (approximately 200 mg) were homogenized in
2 mL of ice-cold 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing
0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone. The homogenates were centrifuged at
4uC for 15 min at 12,000 rpm. The supernatant was used for the
determination of enzyme activities. Superoxide dismutase (SOD;
EC 1.15.1.1), ascorbate peroxidase (APX; EC 1.11.1.11), and
catalase (CAT; EC 1.11.1.6) activities were assayed as described by
Mittova et al. [28]. Peroxidase (POD; EC 1.11.1.7) activity was
assayed following the method described by Morohashi [29].
Microarray Analysis
Total RNAs from the leaf samples of the control and cold stress
treatment (3 d at 4uC) were used for microarray analysis.
Microarrays were performed using the TOM2 Oligo microarray
(http://ted.bti.cornell.edu/). Three independent biological repli￾cates were applied for each pair of control and cold stress
treatments. Dual channel microarray hybridization was carried
out with a Cy3-labeled control sample and a Cy5-labeled cold
stress-treated sample. RNA isolation, amplification, labeling, and
array hybridizations were performed essentially as described by
Gong et al. [21]. Arrays were scanned with a LuxScan 10KA
confocal laser scanner (CapitalBio, China), and the raw data were
extracted using LuxScanTM 3.0 software (CapitalBio, China). A

Print-tip Lowess Normalization method was used to normalize the
ratio values [30]. Normalized ratio data were then log2
transformed. To identify cold-responsive genes, data were
analyzed with the SAM (Significance Analysis of Microarrays)
package [31]. Genes with a q-value (false discovery rate) of less
than 0.05 and a Log2 ratio (cold stress/control) more than 2 or less
than 22 were considered as cold-responsive genes. To further
identify cold-responsive genes with significant (p,0.05) differential
expression between tolerant and sensitive genotypes, statistical
comparisons between tolerant and sensitive genotypes were made
by Student’s t test using SigmaPlot 12. The probe sequences of
differentially expressed genes were retrieved from the Tomato
Functional Genomics Database (http://ted.bti.cornell.edu). To
determine the chromosomal location of these genes, the probe
sequences were further used as query sequences for the BLASTN
search against SGN tomato whole genome chromosome database
(SL2.40; http://solgenomics.net/tools/blast/index.pl). Gene an￾notation and GO term enrichment analysis were performed using
the Tomato Functional Genomics Database [32]. Identification of
significantly altered biochemical pathways was performed using
the Plant MetGenMAP system [33]. The MapMan software was
employed to reveal the cold-responsive genes associated with
photosynthesis, ROS, calcium regulation, transcription, and post￾translational modifications [34]. Gene expression profiles were
clustered using Genesis software [35]. The microarray data have
been deposited in the Tomato Functional Genomics Database,
accession number E060.
Quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen,
USA), and DNase I was used to clean out DNA. First-strand
cDNA was synthesized from 3 mg of total RNA with oligo(dT) and
MMLV reverse transcriptase (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR
(qPCR) was carried out using the LightCycler480 System (Roche)
and SYBRH Premix Ex TaqTM (TaKaRa) according to the
supplier’s manual. The PCR cycling conditions were as follows:
95uC for 1 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95uC for 5s and 60uC for
20 s. Melting curve was routinely performed after 40 cycles to
verify primer specificity. Tomato elongation factor 1a (EF1a) was
used as internal control for qPCR analysis [36]. The fold change
in the expression of each gene was calculated using the DDCT
method [18]. The relative gene expression level was log2
transformed to make the data easily comparable with the array
value. The primers used for this analysis were designed using the
Primer3 software (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3). The primer
sequences are listed in Table S1.
Results and Discussion
Identification of Cold-tolerant IL
To identify the major chromosomal regions of S. habrochaites
genome conferring cold tolerance, seedlings of 93 S. habrochaites ILs
and the two parents, S. lycopersicum LA4024 and S. habrochaites
LA1777, were evaluated by cold stress treatment. Twenty-two ILs
with S. habrochaites introgressions on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 9, 11, and 12, exhibited less severe wilting than the recurrent
parent LA4024 after 3 d of treatment at 4uC. After further
treatment for two weeks, only one IL (LA3969) survived and
exhibited strong tolerance to cold stress like the donor parent
LA1777. To evaluate accurately the tolerance of LA3969, we
compared the performance of this IL to its parents during cold
stress. The phenotypic performance of LA3969 was quite close to
that of LA1777 during cold stress and recovery, and showed
stronger cold tolerance than LA4024 (Figures 1A to 1D). After 10
d of cold stress and recovery for two weeks, the survival rates of
LA3969 and LA1777 were significantly higher than that of
LA4024 (p,0.01; Figure 1E). Although some plants of LA4024
still survived, nearly all leaves were dead, except the newly grown
ones (Figure 1D).
LA3969 contains a large introgressed segment from S.
habrochaites on chromosome 12. Vallejos and Tanksley identified
three QTLs from S. habrochaites responsible for growth at low
temperatures, and the locus Pgi-1 on chromosome 12 elicits
a significant and positive effect only at low temperatures [12].
Truco et al. also detected a QTL from S. habrochaites, on
chromosome 12, responsible for recovery from chill-induced
wilting [13]. Therefore, at least one major QTL/gene responsible
for cold tolerance is located on S. habrochaites chromosome 12.
Less Severe Membrane Damage in the Cold-tolerant
Genotypes
Plants subjected to low temperatures frequently suffer mem￾brane damage, which can be evaluated by the relative electrolyte
leakage and MDA production [23]. During cold stress, all tomato
genotypes presented a tendency to increase the relative electrolyte
leakage and MDA content, but the levels of the two tolerant
genotypes were significantly lower than that of the sensitive one
after 3 d of cold stress (p,0.05; Figures 1F and 1G). The results
indicated that the cold-tolerant genotypes suffer less severe
membrane damage than the sensitive genotype under cold stress.
Compatible solutes, such as proline and carbohydrates, play
important roles in cell osmotic adjustment and maintaining
membrane integrity [37]. Therefore, we analyzed the differences
in accumulation of proline and soluble sugars between cold￾tolerant and -sensitive genotypes under cold stress. During cold
stress, the proline content increased continuously in LA1777. After
5 d of cold treatment, LA1777 had significantly (p,0.05) higher
level of proline than LA4024. But no significant difference in
proline content was found between LA3969 and LA4024 during
cold stress (Figure 1H). The total soluble sugar content exhibited
an upward trend in all three genotypes during cold stress. Only at
3 d of cold treatment, both tolerant genotypes showed significantly
(p,0.05) lower levels of total soluble sugar than the sensitive one
(Figure 1I). Therefore, a positive correlation between proline and
soluble sugars accumulation and cold tolerance in tomato could
not be found.
Differences in Gene Expression between Tolerant and
Sensitive Genotypes under Cold Stress
To investigate the differences in gene expression between cold￾tolerant (LA1777 and LA3969) and -sensitive (LA4024) tomato
genotypes in response to cold stress, we performed comparative
transcriptome analysis using TOM2 microarray. After 3 d of cold
stress, a total of 1613 (864 up- and 749 down-regulated), 1456 (770
up- and 686 down-regulated), and 1523 (800 up- and 723 down￾regulated) cold-responsive genes (q-value,0.5, log2 ratio (cold
stress/control) above 2 and below -2) were identified in LA1777,
LA3969, and LA4024, respectively (Figures 2A and 2B). Among
them, 103 cold-responsive genes (51 up- and 52 down-regulated)
were exclusively identified in both LA1777 and LA3969, whereas
196 cold-responsive genes (89 up- and 107 down-regulated) were
uniquely observed in LA4024. A total of 890 genes (502 up- and
388 down-regulated) were commonly regulated by cold stress in all
three tomato genotypes. The large number of cold-responsive
genes identified in all three genotypes suggests a common response
mechanism to cold stress between cold-tolerant and -sensitive

genotypes. S. habrochaites LA1777 showed a higher number of
specific cold-responsive genes compared to LA3969 and LA4024
(Figures 2A and 2B). These genes may reveal the difference in
response to cold stress between S. habrochaites and S. lycopersicum.
To distinguish the cold-responsive genes which are differentially
expressed between tolerant and sensitive genotypes under cold
stress, the individual gene expression levels of tolerant and sensitive
genotypes were compared further by using Student’s t test. A total
of 92 cold-responsive genes with statistically significant differences
(p,0.05) in expression between tolerant and sensitive genotypes
were identified (Figure S1). To identify genes that localize to
genomic regions contributing to cold tolerance, these 92 genes
were mapped to the tomato chromosomes (SL2.40). Thirty-two
genes were found to be located on the introgressed chromosomal
segments of the 22 selected cold-tolerant ILs and/or cold tolerance
QTLs identified previously in S. habrochaites (Figures 3 and S1). Of
these, 11 genes were localized to the introgressed segment of
LA3969. According to expression profiles and gene annotation,
five genes may play critical roles in conferring the difference in
cold tolerance between LA3969 and LA4024. Among them, four
(SGN-U212650, SGN-U219719, SGN-U212639, and SGN￾U216055) were more strongly induced by cold stress in the
tolerant genotypes than in the sensitive one (Table 1). SGN￾U212650 encoding leucine aminopeptidase A1 (LAP-A1) was up￾regulated by 4.04-, 3.96-, and 1.70-fold in LA1777, LA3969, and
LA4024, respectively. LAP-A1 transcript is induced by various
stimuli, and it is essential for regulating defense and wound
signaling in tomato [38,39]. SGN-U216055 encodes a NAC
transcription factor similar to Arabidopsis RD26. The expression of
RD26 is induced by cold in Arabidopsis, and its transcript level in
response to low temperature is significantly reduced in the
pi4kIIIb1b2 double mutant whose germination is hypersensitive
to chilling [40]. SGN-U212639 encodes a protein similar to
molecular chaperone Hsp90-1. HSP90 is recruited for stomatal
closure and serves essential functions in plants to integrate signals
from their biotic and abiotic environments [41]. Glutathione plays
a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and is essential
for the regulation of oxidant stress. The key enzyme involved in
glutathione homeostasis is gamma-glutamyltransferase. SGN￾U218110 encoding a gamma-glutamyltransferase was more
severely repressed in LA4014 than in LA1777 and LA3969 under
cold stress (Table 1).
According to chromosomal location, expression profiles, and
gene annotation, ten genes located on other chromosomes may
also confer cold tolerance in LA3969 (Table 1). Among these,
SGN-U213712, SGN-U215018, and SGN-U221957 coding for
a beta-amylase, a hypothetical protein, and a heat stress
transcription factor, respectively, were markedly suppressed in
LA4024. SGN-U215123 and SGN-U234004 encoding homolo￾gues of Arabidopsis WRKY31 and MYB15 were more strongly
induced by cold stress in LA4024 than in LA1777 and LA3969.
AtMYB15 has been found to negatively regulate the expression of
cold-responsive genes in Arabidopsis [42]. The other five genes were
more strongly induced in the two tolerant genotypes than in the
sensitive one. The precise roles of these differentially expressed
genes remain to be elucidated via other experimental approaches,
such as over-expression and/or RNAi strategies.
Differences in Gene Expression between LA1777 and
LA3969 under Cold Stress
LA3969 only contains a large introgressed segment from
chromosome 12 of S. habrochaites, there are still additional QTLs
for cold tolerance on other chromosomes of S. habrochaites. To
further identify other genes which may confer cold tolerance in S.
habrochaites, the expression levels of individual genes were
compared further between LA1777 and LA3969 by using
Student’s t test. A total of 295 cold-responsive genes with
statistically significant differences (p,0.01) in expression between
LA1777 and LA3969 were identified. Among these, 126 genes also
showed statistically significant differences in expression between
LA1777 and LA4024 (Table S2). Of these, 48 genes were mapped
to the introgressed regions of the 22 selected cold-tolerant ILs
and/or cold tolerance QTLs identified previously in S. habrochaites
(Table S2). According to chromosomal location, expression
profiles, and gene annotation, 15 genes that are most likely to
confer cold tolerance were identified (Table 1). The expression of
seven genes in LA3969 and LA4024 showed opposite expression
patterns from LA1777 under cold stress. SGN-U214065, SGN￾U229565, SGN-U213791, and SGN-U212850, coding for a UDP￾glucosyltransferase, a zinc finger family protein, an acidic 27 kDa
endochitinase, and a peroxidase, respectively, were down-regulat￾ed by cold stress in LA1777, whereas they were up-regulated in
LA3969 and LA4024. For example, SGN-U212850 was down￾regulated by 1.02-fold in LA1777, but it was induced by more than
5.50-fold in LA3969 and LA4024 under cold stress. On contrary,
two hypothetical proteins (SGN-U213115 and SGN-U216044),
and an amine oxidase (SGN-U227893) were up-regulated by cold
stress in LA1777, while they were down-regulated in LA3969 and
LA4024. Six genes (SGN-U215206, SGN-U216449, SGN￾U218236, SGN-U223072, SGN-U212825, and SGN-U223737)
showed significantly higher fold induction in LA1777 than in
LA3969 and LA4024 under cold stress. It suggested these genes
may play positive roles in response to cold stress in tomato. For

instance, SGN-U212825 encoding a homologue of Arabidopsis
LOS2 was up-regulated by 3.37-fold under cold stress in LA1777,
whereas only by 0.67- and 0.88-fold in LA3969 and LA4024,
respectively (Table 1). In Arabidopsis, LOS2 encodes a bi-functional
enolase and plays a positive role in the regulation of cold￾responsive genes expression via transcriptional repression of
ZAT10/STZ which is a negative regulator of CBF-target genes
[43].
Confirmation of Microarray Results
To confirm our microarray results, 42 genes with differential
expression patterns were evaluated using qPCR. The microarray
data showed a very good correlation with the qPCR results
(r = 0.93; Figure S2). Most of these genes verified by qPCR showed
the same expression patterns among the three tomato genotypes as
in microarrays. Differences between the two methods were on the
quantitative levels. The qPCR results showed a slightly higher fold
induction or repression than the microarray analysis (Table S3).
Similar phenomenon has been reported previously [44].
Previous studies have identified several genes that were
regulated by cold stress in tomato. Among them, seven were
identified as cold-responsive genes in microarray results. These
include dehydrin [45,46], SAP8 and SAP11 [47], alternative
oxidase [48], LeVDE [49], ERF2 [50], and GME [51]. The
expression patterns of these genes were similar among the three
genotypes or higher in the two tolerant genotypes (Table S4). For
example, SGN-U213745 encoding a dehydrin protein was up￾regulated significantly higher in the two tolerant genotypes than in
the sensitive genotype when subjected to cold stress (4uC) for 3
days (p,0.05; Figure S1). This gene has been considered to be
a marker gene for cold stress response in tomato [46]. These
results demonstrate that our microarray results are reliable.
GO Term Enrichment Analysis
To unravel the significantly altered biological processes upon
cold stress, the up- and down-regulated genes of the three tomato
genotypes were subjected to the GO term enrichment analysis
[32]. As expected, some stress-related GO biological process
terms, such as ‘response to stress’, ‘response to temperature
stimulus’, ‘response to stimulus’, ‘response to abiotic or biotic
stimulus’, and ‘defense response’, were significantly enriched
(p,0.01, FDR as the cut-off) among the up- or down-regulated
genes in at least one tomato genotype (Table S5). More GO terms
were significantly enriched (p,0.01, FDR as the cut-off) among
the up-regulated genes in the two tolerant genotypes (Figure 4;
Table S5). Among these, ten GO terms were specially enriched in

both tolerant genotypes. Of these, four were involved in stress
responses, including ‘immune response’, ‘response to abiotic
stimulus’, ‘negative regulation of response to stimulus response’,
and ‘response to UV’. Only three GO terms were exclusively
enriched among the up-regulated genes in LA4024. However, 23
biological processes were significantly suppressed only in LA4024
(Figure 4; Table S5). Interestingly, some of them are associated
with stress responses, such as ‘response to external stimulus’,
‘regulation of hormone levels’, ‘calcium ion homeostasis’, and
‘oxidation reduction’ (Figure 4). More biological processes were
significantly inhibited exclusively in LA4024 suggests the sensitive
genotype is more severely influenced than the two tolerant
genotypes under cold stress.
To explore the modulated biological processes between tolerant
and sensitive genotypes under cold stress, the 92 differentially
expressed genes were also analyzed using GO term enrichment
analysis [32]. A total of 21 biological process GO terms varied
significantly between tolerant and sensitive genotypes under cold
stress (p,0.01, FDR as the cut-off; Table S6). Most of them were
involved in stress responses, such as ‘response to stimulus’,
‘response to heat’, ‘response to abiotic stimulus’, ‘response to
stress’, and ‘response to UV’. A large proportion (41.3%) of
differentially expressed genes was classified into functional
category ‘response to stimulus’. Moreover, GO terms ‘response
to auxin stimulus’, ‘response to gibberellin stimulus’, ‘response to
reactive oxygen species (ROS)’, ‘brassinosteroid metabolic pro￾cess’, and ‘calcium-mediated signaling’ were also overrepresented.
Several transcripts involved in hormone or ROS homeostasis were
also found to be differentially expressed between tolerant and
sensitive genotypes under cold stress. These results indicate ROS,

hormones, and calcium as signaling molecules may play important
roles in regulating gene expression in response to cold stress.
Less Inhibition of Photosynthesis in the Cold-tolerant
Genotypes
GO term enrichment analysis showed that photosynthesis was
significantly inhibited by cold stress, and more related genes were
down-regulated in LA4024 (Tables S5 and S7). The significant
suppression of photosynthesis-related genes under cold stress has
been observed in Arabidopsis and barley [15,18]. The down￾regulated genes covered all the aspects of photosynthesis, including
the light reactions, Calvin cycle, and photorespiration (Figure 5A;
Table S7). The suppression of the photosynthetic light reactions
contained PSI, PSII, ATP synthase, and electron carriers. Many
transcripts involved in PSII were strongly repressed in LA4024,
and some were down-regulated by more than 5-fold, such as SGN￾U218907, SGN-U218911, SGN-U234083, SGN-U212937, and
SGN-U218904. Most of these genes encode chlorophyll a/
b binding proteins. In addition, some genes involved in
photorespiration and calvin cyle were also severely suppressed in
LA4024, such as SGN-U232245, SGN-U212963, SGN-U215203,
and SGN-U213321 (Table S7). A transcript, SGN-U225498,
encoding RuBisCO small subunit 3B was more strongly induced
in the two tolerant genotypes (Figure S1). The expression of seven
genes involved in photosynthesis was validated by qPCR. As
shown in Figure 5B, nearly all of them were strongly down￾regulated in LA4024. Among these, SGN-U231963 and SGN￾U232245 coding for a ferredoxin-NADP(+)-oxidoreductase and
a glycolate oxidase, respectively, were less severely suppressed in
LA1777 and LA3969 than in LA4024 (p,0.05). SGN-U218904
and SGN-U232496 coding for a chlorophyll a/b binding protein
and a PSII reaction center W protein, respectively, were less
severely suppressed in LA1777 than in LA4024 (p,0.01).
Transcriptome analysis suggested that the PSII was inhibited
more severely in the sensitive genotype (Figure 5A; Table S7). To
confirm this, the maximum quantum efficiency of PSII photo￾chemistry (Fv/Fm) and the quantum yield of PSII electron
transport (WPSII) were measured. As shown in Figure 5C, all
tomato genotypes displayed a time-dependent decline in Fv/Fm

and WPSII under cold stress, but the decrease was greater in the
sensitive genotype. After 7 d of cold stress treatment, LA1777 and
LA3969 showed significantly higher values of Fv/Fm and WPSII
than LA4024. Previous study indicated that S. habrochaites showed
less severe inhibition of photosynthesis than S. lycopersicum during
chilling stress [4]. These results demonstrate that photosynthesis
(especially PSII) is suppressed more severely in the cold-sensitive
genotype than in the cold-tolerant genotype under cold stress.
Differences in Gene Expression and Enzyme Activity
Related to ROS between Tolerant and Sensitive
Genotypes under Cold Stress
GO term enrichment analysis showed that the biological process
‘oxidation reduction’ was significantly suppressed in LA4024
(Figure 4), and the functional category ‘response to ROS’ was
significantly enriched among the differentially expressed genes
between tolerant and sensitive genotypes under cold stress (Table
S6). To further characterize the differences in ROS-related gene
expression between tolerant and sensitive genotypes, cold-re￾sponsive genes related to ROS were analyzed. A total of 74 ROS￾related genes were regulated by cold stress, and eight of them were
confirmed by qPCR (Table S8; Figure S3A). Among these, seven
showed significant differences in gene expression between tolerant
and sensitive genotypes under cold stress (Table S8). Both
microarray and qPCR analysis showed that SGN-U215231 was
more strongly induced by cold stress in LA1777 and LA3969 than
in LA4024 (Figures S1 and S3A). SGN-U215231 encodes
a peroxidase similar to the pepper peroxidase CaPO2. qPCR
analysis showed that SGN-U215628 encoding an amine oxidase
was more severely repressed by cold stress in LA4024 than in
LA3969 and LA1777 (Figure S3A). Both CaPO2 and amine
oxidase are involved in ROS generation [52,53]. Three glutathi￾one S-transferase genes (SGN-U213825, SGN-U214482, and
SGN-U226166) were more strongly induced by cold stress in
LA1777 and LA3969 than in LA4024 (Table S8). For instance,
SGN-U226166 was up-regulated by 2.26- and 2.18-fold in
LA1777 and LA3969, respectively, but it was down-regulated by
0.43-fold in LA4024 under cold stress. Previous studies demon￾strated that overexpression of GSTs in tobacco improved cold
tolerance [54,55]. The significantly higher expression of GSTs in
the two tolerant genotypes might have contributed to cold
tolerance by reducing oxidative damage and regulating cellular
redox homeostasis.
We further analyzed the activities of some antioxidant enzymes
under cold stress, including APX, POD, CAT, and SOD. After 3
d of cold treatment, APX activity was significantly lower in the two
tolerant genotypes than in the sensitive one (Figure S3B). By
contrast, POD activity was significantly higher only at 3 d of cold
treatment in the two tolerant genotypes than in the sensitive one
(Figure S3C). This is consistent with the expression pattern of
peroxidase gene (SGN-U215231) mentioned above. CAT activity
was significantly decreased in LA1777 than in LA4024 after 5 d of
cold treatment, but no significant difference was found between
LA396 and LA4024 during cold stress (Figure S3D). No significant
difference in SOD activity was found between tolerant and
sensitive genotypes during cold stress (Figure S3E).
To check whether the changes in gene expression and enzyme
activities would cause differences in ROS accumulation between
tolerant and sensitive genotypes under cold stress, the presence of
H2O2 and O2
- in the leaves of the three genotypes were detected
with DAB and NBT staining. All three tomato genotypes exhibited
a tendency of increased staining, indicating the accumulation of
ROS during cold stress. But no remarkable difference between
tolerant and sensitive genotypes was observed (Figures S3F and
S3G). ROS have traditionally been regarded as toxic molecules.
However, recent studies indicated that ROS play a key role in the
complex signaling networks in plant [56–58]. Transcriptome
analysis revealed that oxidative-mediated transcriptional regula￾tory network configures the early response mechanisms to chilling
stress in japonica rice [17]. Thus, the accumulation of ROS may
not be the main reason that causes cellular damage under cold
stress in tomato. ROS as signaling molecules may play a critical
role in regulating gene expression in response to cold stress.
Differentially Expressed Genes Involved in Hormone
Metabolism and Signaling
Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed that a large
number of genes related to abscisic acid (ABA), jasmonic acid
(JA), auxin, cytokinins (CKs), ethylene, gibberellin, and brassino￾lides were regulated by cold stress in tomato (Table S9). Three
hormone-related GO biological processes were significantly
enriched among the differentially expressed genes between
tolerant and sensitive genotypes under cold stress, which are
‘response to auxin stimulus’, ‘response to gibberellin stimulus’, and
‘brassinosteroid metabolic process’ (Table S6). Hormones as
signaling molecules are supposed to play important roles in
regulating gene expression in response to cold stress in tomato.
A total of 14 hormone-related genes were differentially
expressed between tolerant and sensitive genotypes under cold
stress (Table S9). Among these, SGN-U214274 encoding a homo￾logue of Arabidopsis ABA3 was more severely suppressed in the
sensitive genotype, which was validated by qPCR (Figure S1;
Table S3). In Arabidopsis, the ABA-deficient mutant aba3/los5
shows a significant reduction in the expression of cold stress￾responsive genes and exhibits higher sensitivity to freezing stress
[59]. The significant suppression of this gene may influence the
expression of many downstream cold-responsive genes in the
sensitive genotype. Two auxin-related genes, SGN-U215655 and
SGN-U215106, were differentially expressed between tolerant and
sensitive genotypes under cold stress. SGN-U215655 encoding an

auxin-responsive family protein was more strongly induced in
LA4024. Its homologue in Arabidopsis and peach was also found to
be regulated by cold stress [60]. The expression of SGN-U215106
was up-regulated by 2.25- and 2.78-fold in LA1777 and LA3969,
respectively, whereas only by 0.95-fold in LA4024 under cold
stress (Figure S1). SGN-U215106 encodes an auxin-binding F-box
protein similar to AtSKP2A. Overexpression of AtSKP2A increased
tolerance to osmotic stress in Arabidopsis [61]. This gene was more
strongly induced by cold stress in the two tolerant genotypes,
suggesting its up-regulation may confer cold tolerance in tomato.
Five genes involved in the JA biosynthesis pathway were
differentially expressed between tolerant and sensitive genotypes
under cold stress (Table S9). Among these, two lipoxygenase genes
(SGN-U214851 and SGN-U234711) and two 12-oxophytodieno￾ate reductase genes (AJ242551 and SGN-U228308) were more
severely repressed in LA4024. However, SGN-U217795 encoding
an allene oxide synthase was more strongly induced in LA4024 as
compared to LA1777 and LA3969. JA is essential for regulating
the systemic defense response in tomato [62]. The depression of JA
biosynthesis would affect the expression of JA-responsive genes.
Previous studies indicated that the expression of leucine amino￾peptidase A1 (LAP-A1), JA2, pathogenesis-related proteins (PRs),
and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) were induced by JA
[38,63,64]. Interestingly, we found JA2 (SGN-U216055), PR
(SGN-U215661), PAL1 (SGN-U239712), and LAP-A1 (SGN￾U212650) were more strongly induced by cold stress in the two
tolerant genotypes than in the sensitive one (Figure S1). JA may act
as a positive regulator in response to cold stress in tomato.
Both microarray and qPCR analysis showed significantly lower
expression of SGN-U223622 in the two tolerant genotypes than in
the sensitive one (Table S9). SGN-U223622 encodes a CK
oxidase/dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the degradation of CK.
The expression of CKXs was much lower in the Arabidopsis CK￾deficient ipt mutant and the mutant was more tolerant to salt and
drought stress than the wild type [65]. Therefore, SGN-U223622
possibly plays a negative role in response to cold stress in tomato.
Differentially Expressed Genes Involved in Calcium
Signaling
GO term enrichment analysis revealed that the biological
process ‘calcium-mediated signaling’ was significantly (p,0.05,
FDR as the cut-off) enriched among the differentially expressed
genes between tolerant and sensitive genotypes under cold stress
(Table S6). A total of 30, 24, and 29 genes involved in calcium
regulation were affected by cold stress in LA1777, LA3969, and
LA4024, respectively (Table S10). Among them, seven genes were
differentially expressed between tolerant and sensitive genotypes.
Of these, SGN-U214767, SGN-U220721, SGN-U227216, and
SGN-U215654 were more strongly induced by cold stress in the
two tolerant genotypes than in the sensitive one (Figure S1; Table
S10). The qPCR analysis showed that the expression of SGN￾U227216, a gene encoding calcium-binding protein, was signifi￾cantly higher in the two tolerant genotypes than in the sensitive
one under cold stress (p,0.01; up-regulated by 7.16-, 5.17-, 2.41-
fold in LA1777, LA3969, and LA4024, respectively). SGN￾U214767 and SGN-U220721 encode calcium-binding proteins
which are similar to Arabidopsis TCH2 and AtCP1, respectively.
Previous studies indicated that TCH2 and AtCP1 were induced by
cold stress in Arabidopsis [66,67]. SGN-U215654 encodes a putative
calmodulin. Calcium-binding proteins and calmodulin are Ca2+
sensors that sense changes in cellular Ca2+ and regulate the
expression of downstream genes [68]. The up-regulation of these
four Ca2+ sensors was significantly higher in the two tolerant
genotypes under cold stress, suggesting these might act as positive
regulators in tolerance to cold stress in tomato. Three genes were
more strongly induced in the sensitive genotype. Both SGN￾U221694 and SGN-U231357 encode sodium/calcium exchanger
family proteins, and SGN-U214886 encodes a calmodulin-de￾pendent protein kinase, similar to NtCPK4. In tobacco, NtCPK4
expression was induced by salt stress and gibberellin [69].
Differentially Expressed Transcription Factors
Transcription factors (TFs) play crucial roles in regulating the
expression of stress-responsive genes under biotic and abiotic
stresses. A larger number of TFs were regulated by cold stress at
least in one tomato genotype. Representative ZF families included
MYB, NAC, WRKY, AP2/EREBP, HSF (heat shock factor),
bHLH, bZIP, and zinc finger (Figure S4). Among these, ten ZFs
were specifically expressed in the two tolerant genotypes under
cold stress (Figure S4A). Sixteen TFs were regulated by cold stress
exclusively in LA4024, and most of them were down-regulated
(Figure S4B). A total of 96 TFs were regulated by cold stress
common to all three genotypes. Nearly half of them belong to
NAC, WRKY, and zinc finger ZF superfamilies (Figure S4C).

NAC, WRKY and zinc finger TFs play important roles in
response to abiotic stress by controlling stress-responsive gene
expression and/or modifying other signaling and regulatory
networks [70–72]. So many NAC, WRKY, and zinc finger TFs
were induced in all three genotypes, depicting the development of
complex and highly interconnected regulatory networks in re￾sponse to cold stress in tomato. All cold-responsive genes,
belonging to NAC, WRKY, AP2/EREBP, and HSF gene families,
were enhanced in all three genotypes. The up-regulation of two
WRKYs (SGN-U215123 and SGN-U213637) was confirmed by
qPCR (Table S3). Many tomato WRKY TFs were also found to
be induced by salt or drought stress [20,21]. Therefore, the up￾regulation of WRKY TFs may be a general stress response
common to various abiotic stresses in tomato.
Among these cold-responsive TFs, eight showed significant
changes in transcript abundance between tolerant and sensitive
genotypes under cold stress, including SGN-U221957, SGN￾U224924, SGN-U218469, SGN-U234004, SGN-U215123, SGN￾U216055, SGN-U216769, and SGN-U215577 (Figure S4). SGN￾U221957 and SGN-U224924 encode HSFs. The expression of
SGN-U221957 was down-regulated by 2.58-fold in LA4024,
whereas it was slightly up-regulated in LA1777 and LA3969 (0.22-
and 0.72-fold, respectively) under cold stress. SGN-U224924 was
more strongly up-regulated by cold stress in the two tolerant
genotypes than the sensitive one (Figure S1). HSFs play a central
role in regulating the expression of heat shock proteins (Hsps) in
response to heat and other stress stimuli [73]. We found that the
expression of two Hsps (SGN-U212639 and SGN-U212643) was
significantly higher in the two tolerant genotypes than in the
sensitive one under cold stress (Figure S1). SGN-U216769 (SAP11)
encoding an A20/AN1 zinc finger protein that has been found to
be induced by cold stress in tomato [47]. SGN-U234004 and
SGN-U218469 encode MYBs similar to Arabidopsis MYB15 and
MYB107. MYB15 is a negative regulator of cold tolerance in
Arabidopsis [42]. These two MYBs were more strongly induced in
the sensitive genotype adumbrating them as negative regulators of
cold tolerance in tomato. SGN-U215577, encoding a homologue
of Arabidopsis ASPG1 (aspartic protease in guard cell 1), was more
severely suppressed by cold stress in LA4024. Overexpression of
the ASPG1 gene conferred drought avoidance in Arabidopsis by up￾regulating the expression of drought- and/or ABA-inducible
genes, such as KIN1, KIN2, RAB18, and RD26 [74]. KIN1, KIN2,
and RAB18 are also cold-inducible genes [75–77]. These results
suggest that the ASPG1 gene may also play a positive role in plant

habrochaites LA1777. ROS, calcium, and hormones as signaling molecules may play critical roles in tomato adaptation to cold stress. The
modulation of these signaling pathways then activated transcription regulation. The differential expression of transcription factors then caused many
transcripts modified between tolerant and sensitive genotypes, such as functional proteins, post-translational modification proteins, and genes
associated with physiological and metabolic processes, such as photosynthesis, ROS production or scavenging system, and metabolic enzymes. The
modulation of the expression of genes associated with post-translational modifications, ROS, and hormones then feedback to fine-tune transcription
factors, ROS, and hormone signaling networks. These specific modifications make LA3969 be close to its donor parent LA1777, and both showed

adaptation to cold stress by activating the downstream stress￾responsive genes.
Differentially Expressed Genes Involved in Post￾translational Modifications
Post-translational modifications play important roles in rapid
and fine-tuned regulation of transcription factors under abiotic
stress [78]. A total of 171 genes associated with post-translational
modifications were regulated by cold stress in at least one tomato
genotype (Table S11). Among these, six showed significant
differences in expression between tolerant and sensitive genotypes
under cold stress, including SGN-U215679, SGN-U212650,
SGN-U229977, SGN-U234375, SGN-U220612, and SGN￾U215106 (Figure S1; Table S11). SGN-U220612 and SGN￾U234375 encoding RING-H2-type zinc-finger proteins similar to
Arabidopsis XERICO were more strongly induced by cold stress in
the two tolerant genotypes than in the sensitive one (Table S11).
Overexpression of XERICO enhances drought tolerance by
accumulating more ABA in Arabidopsis [79]. The significantly
higher up-regulation of these two unigenes in the two tolerant
genotypes suggested that they might act as positive regulators in
the cold stress response in tomato. Another gene, SGN-U215106,
encodes a homologue of Arabidopsis SKP2A. SKP2A is an auxin￾binding F-box protein, and its overexpression in transgenic
Arabidopsis confers tolerance to osmotic stress [61]. F-box proteins
are part of the ubiquitin ligase SCF complex that catalyzes the
degradation of the Aux/IAA proteins through ubiquitination
pathway [80]. Previous studies indicated that auxin regulates
transcription by promoting the degradation of the Aux/IAA
proteins [81]. The remarkable increase in the expression of this
gene in the two tolerant genotypes may activate the auxin￾mediated transcription under cold stress. Interestingly, we found
the GO term ‘response to auxin’ was significantly enriched among
the differentially expressed genes between tolerant and sensitive
genotypes under cold stress. These results suggested a potential
link between cold and auxin signaling pathways.
Biochemical Pathways Significantly Altered Between
Tolerant and Sensitive Genotypes under Cold Stress
To identify the significantly altered biochemical pathways
between cold-tolerant and -sensitive tomato genotypes under cold
stress, the 92 differentially expressed genes were analyzed using the
Plant MetGenMap system [33]. Seven biochemical pathways
varied significantly between tolerant and sensitive genotypes under
cold stress, including jasmonic acid biosynthesis, brassinosteroid
metabolic process, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, starch degrada￾tion, leucine biosynthesis, Calvin cycle, and removal of superoxide
radicals (Table 2). The phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and Calvin
cycle pathways were significantly enhanced in the two tolerant
genotypes under cold stress compared with the sensitive one.
Three UDP-glucosyltransferase genes involved in brassinosteroid
metabolic process were more strongly induced by cold stress in the
two tolerant genotypes than in the sensitive one. Some genes from
UDP-glucosyltransferase family genes have been found to be
regulated by abiotic and/or biotic stresses in Arabidopsis [82]. SGN￾U213712, encoding a beta-amylase involved in starch degrada￾tion, was more severely suppressed in the sensitive genotype.
Previous studies indicate that the increase in beta-amylase activity
is correlated with maltose accumulation which contributes to the
protection of the PSII photochemical efficiency, proteins, and
membranes during freezing stress [83,84]. Therefore, the signif￾icant repression of this beta-amylase gene may decrease maltose
content and reduce PSII photochemical efficiency in the cold￾sensitive genotype under cold stress. In agreement with this, we
found that the PSII photochemical efficiency was repressed more
severely in LA4024 after 7 d of cold stress treatment (Figure 5C).
Conclusions
In this study, a total of 93 S. habrochaites LA1777 ILs, together
with their donor (S. habrochaites LA1777) and recurrent (S.
lycopersicum LA4024) parent were evaluated for cold tolerance at
the seedling stage. The IL LA3969 and its donor parent were
found to be more cold tolerant than the recurrent parent during
cold stress (Figures 1A to 1E). To better understand the
mechanisms of cold tolerance in tomato, differences in stress￾related physiological indicators and global gene expression
between cold-tolerant (LA3969 and LA1777) and -sensitive
(LA4024) genotypes under cold stress were investigated. During
cold stress, the two tolerant genotypes showed less severe
membrane damage, less photoinhibition of PSII, and lower APX
activities than the sensitive genotype. Comparative transcriptome
analysis revealed 92 genes were differentially expressed between
tolerant and sensitive genotypes after 3 d of cold stress (4uC). A
total of 80 genes with significant differences in expression between
S. habrochaites and S. lycopersicum were mapped to the introgressed
chromosomal regions of the 22 selected cold-tolerant ILs and/or
cold tolerance QTLs reported previously in S. habrochaites
[7,12,13]. According to chromosomal location, expression differ￾ences, and gene annotation, 30 genes that are most likely to confer
cold tolerance in S. habrochaites were identified (Table 1).
ROS, calcium, and hormones as signaling molecules may play
critical roles in tomato adaptation to cold stress. The modulation
of these signaling pathways could activate directly stress response￾related genes or interact directly/indirectly with several other
signaling networks to regulate transcription. The activated TFs
(e.g., MYBs, HSFs, WRKYs, NACs, and zinc fingers) then caused
differential expression of many transcripts among tolerant and
sensitive genotypes, such as functional proteins (e.g., HSPs, PRs,
and dehydrin), post-translational modification proteins (e.g.,
SKP2A, LAP-A1, and XERICOs), and genes associated with
physiological and metabolic processes, such as photosynthesis (e.g.,
FNR, GOXs, and RBCS3B), ROS production or scavenging
system (e.g., PODs, AO, and GSTs), hormone biosynthesis and
metabolism (ABA3, LOXs, and UGTs), and other metabolic
enzymes (e.g., PAL and BAM). These specific modifications make
LA1777 and LA3969 more cold tolerant than LA4024, by
reducing cell membrane damage and photoinhibition, regulating
metabolism, and maintaining hormone and ROS homeostasis.
Based on our results, we summarized a hypothetical working
model for the potential roles of this introgressed chromosomal
segment from S. habrochaites LA1777 in the regulation of cold stress
tolerance (Figure 6).
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report comparing
the differences in global gene expression between tolerant and
sensitive genotypes under cold stress in tomato. The results not
only provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of cold
tolerance in tomato, but also provide potential candidate genes for
genetic improvement of the cultivated tomato.
