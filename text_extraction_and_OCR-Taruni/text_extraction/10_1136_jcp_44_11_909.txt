Central pontine myelinolysis in liver
transplantation
A P Boon, M P Carey, D H Adams, J Buckels, P McMaster
Abstract
Five cases of central pontine myelino￾lysis (CPM) were detected by
neuropathological examination in a
series of 50 patients coming to necropsy
after liver transplantation. One patient
also had extrapontine myelinolysis. In no
case was the diagnosis made during life.
Only two patients showed rapid rises in
serum sodium concentrations. The
incidence of hyponatraemia, before and
after transplantation, and rapid rises in
serum sodium in patients with CPM was
significantly greater than in the 45
patients showing no neuropathological
evidence of CPM.
It is concluded that there is a high
incidence of CPM after liver transplan￾tation, that clinical diagnosis is difficult,
and that there is no simple direct
correlation between rapid serum sodium
changes and the development of this
condition. Avoidance of major elec￾trolyte fluctuations at the time of liver
transplantation is recommended but it
must be emphasised that CPM may
occur without any rapid rise in serum
sodium concentration.

Central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) is
characterised by symmetrical loss of myelin in
the pontine basalis, with relative preservation,
at least in the early stages, of axons and
neuronal cell bodies. The clinical effects range
from minor neurological impairment to a fully
developed "locked in" syndrome.' Since the
condition was first described over 30 years ago2
many case reports, clinical series, and reviews
have appeared, and extrapontine variants are
now recognised.''0 Vulnerable patients
included the severely ill, alcoholics, those with
liver disease and those sustaining large swings
in serum electrolyte concentrations." Liver
transplant recipients fall into some or all of
these categories and, therefore, a high
incidence of CPM might be expected.
The precise aetiology of CPM is uncertain,
but the overly rapid correction of hypo￾natraemia may be an important factor.'220 The
importance of changes in serum sodium con￾centration has been challenged,2'22 however,
and there is continuing controversy.2"29
Patients undergoing liver transplantation in
our centre have serum electrolyte concentra￾tions closely monitored throughout their
clinical course and are, therefore, a suitable
group in which to study the role of serum
sodium in the pathogenesis of CPM.
Methods
Up to the end of 1989, 279 patients had
received 326 orthotopic liver transplants at the
Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham. One
hundred and seventeen (41 9%) had died at
the time of this study and of these 71 (60-7%)
came to necropsy at our centre. Cerebral tis￾sue was collected from 52 patients, including
47 entire brains. As the pons was not sampled
in two cases only 50 cases were included in the
study. This group comprised 34 females and
16 males and represented 42-7% of all deathlis
following liver transplantation. The mean age
was 37-9 years; 41 were adults (range 21-63
years) and nine were children. These patients
had received 64 transplants, including 13
retransplants and one patient who was trans￾planted three times.
Gross external findings were determined at
necropsy and the brains then fixed whole by
suspension in 10% formalin for three to six
weeks before slicing. In the 47 cases collected
prospectively the brain stem and cerebellum
were detached and the cerebrum sliced coron￾ally at one cm intervals. Any grossly obvious
lesions were sampled for histological examina￾tion. Routinely, blocks were also taken from
frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital lobes,
hippocampus, basal ganglia, thalamus,
cerebellum and medulla. The pons was
carefully examined for evidence of CPM and
blocks taken at mid-pontine level. In cases
where the clincal history suggested pontine
disease or where there was evidence of CPM
in the first block, additional blocks were taken
to include rostral and caudal pons. In three
cases only single random blocks of pons were
available for study.
The tissue was processed to paraffin wax
using a standard technique and sections were
cut and stained with haematoxylin and eosin
and luxol fast blue. In cases where initial
sections were suspect for CPM, immunohisto￾chemical stains for glial fibrillary acidic
protein (GFAP) and neurofilament protein
were prepared using an indirect immuno￾peroxidase technique,30 and further blocks of
tissue were stained with oil red 0 to detect
neutral fat.
All clinical records were carefully scrutin￾ised and particular note was made of
neurological features and serum sodium
changes in both the periods before and after
transplantation.

Results
Five brains (10%) showed histological
evidence of CPM and the basic clinical data for
these patients are summarised in table 1. Three
were female (including two children) and two
were male; mean age was 34 years (range 8-54).
In one case (OL21 1) the condition was suspec￾ted on gross examination of the pons. One
patient (OL278/279) underwent early retrans￾plantation for primary non-function; the
remainder were single transplants. Mean
survival after transplantation was 42 days
(range two to 87).
NEUROLOGICAL FINDINGS
Case OL102 (female, aged 16) was drowsy
preoperatively, but there was no electroence￾phalographic evidence of encephalopathy. The
drowsiness persisted after transplantation,
with generalised weakness and an episode of
grand mal fitting on the 38th postoperative day.
Case 0L103 (male, aged 47) was in grade 1-2
hepatic encephalopathy before transplantation
and developed grand mal seizures three days
postoperatively. He remained weak and ence￾phalopathic until death.
Case OLl 19 (male, aged 54) was not ence￾phalopathic before transplantation but
developed pronounced spasticity in all limbs,
worse on the right side, by the fifth post- operative day. He developed grand mal fits
around the same time, with deviation of the
head and eyes to the left. An electroence￾phalogram showed continuous epileptic activity, mainly on the right side. From day 1 1,
he had repeated episodes of respiratory arrest,
recovering spontaneously each time after a
temporary period of artifical ventilation.
Neurological examination suggested a
pseudobulbar palsy. He deteriorated and died
on day 18.
Case OL211 (male, aged 45) was in grade 2-3
encephalopathy before transplantation and
postoperatively never regained full conscious￾ness. He sustained grand mal fits on the third
postoperative day with right conjugate eye deviation. Facial dystonia and dyskinesia
developed and he became generally rigid with
increased upper limb tone, flaccid paraparesis
of the lower limbs, and drowsiness.
Case OL278/279 (female, aged 8) was trans￾planted in grade 4 + coma but died 13 hours
after the second transplantation without
regaining consciousness. No focal neurological
abnormalities were noted at any stage.
Death in the first four cases was attributed to
sepsis and multi-organ failure and in the last
case, to cerebral oedema and coning. CPM was

not diagnosed clinically in any ofthese patients,
but in retrospect, was probably a major con￾tributing factor in the death of cases OL102,
OLl 19, and OL211.
HISTOLOGICAL FINDINGS
In three cases (OL 102, OL21 1, and OL278/
279) histological features were typical of CPM.
There were symmetrical demyelinating lesions
in the basal pons with a "bats wing" configura￾tion in coronal section and relative sparing of
longitudinal fasciculi (fig 1). Areas ofdemyelin￾ation were sharply demarcated from normal
tissues. Foamy macrophages, fairly scanty in
case OL278/279, were scattered throughout
the lesions and both neuronal cell bodies and
axons were relatively well preserved (fig 2). A
variable degree of fibrillary astrocytosis was
evident on immunostaining for GFAP (fig 3).
In case OL211 similar changes were present in
the lateral geniculate nuclei, indicating
extrapontine myelinolysis. Other findings were:
severe generalised cerebral oedema in case
OL278/279, severe hypoxic-type neuronal
damage in cases OL102 and OL278/279, and
widespread Alzheimer type II astrocytosis,
indicating hepatic encephalopathy, in cases
OL211 and OL278/279.

The findings in cases OL103 and OL1 19
were less obviously due to CPM in initial
sections. Both showed bilateral, approximately
symmetrical areas of demyelination in the basal
pons. These were situated less centrally,
however, than in the first three cases and
showed a greater degree of axonal degeneration
with "balloon" formation, less conspicuous
foamy cells, and more prominent fibrillary
astrocytosis. Features were, however, suffi￾ciently similar to the spectrum of changes
recognised in CPM to make the diagnosis with
reasonable confidence. Other findings in case

circumscribed focus of sterile haemorrhage in
the subcortical white matter of the right
parietal lobe; the aetiology was uncertain. In
case OLl 19 bilateral areas of hypoxic-type
laminar necrosis of the parietal cortex were
present in typical arterial "watershed" zones.
BIOCHEMICAL FINDINGS
Serum sodium values for each of the five
patients with CPM were plotted (figs 4A-E).
"Steep" rises (> 12 mmol/l/day)'0 were
encountered only in cases OL 19 and OL211
and neither became hypernatraemic. Slower,
but more sustained rises to mildly hyper￾natraemic concentrations, were noted in cases
OL102 and OL103. Rises in cases OL102,
OL119, and OL211 coincided with trans￾plantation, while in case OL103 this preceded
operation by several days. In case OL278/279
serum sodium values remained within normal
reference intervals.
Examination of serum sodium values in the
45 patients without histological evidence of
CPM showed 16 who sustained at least one
increase of > 12 mmol/l/day (in 15 this co￾incided with transplantation), 19 with
preoperative hyponatraemia, and 12 who
became hypernatraemic for at least one post￾operative day (table 2). There were no sig￾nificant differences between this group and the
patients with CPM with respect to the
incidence of any of these factors taken
individually. Collectively, however, the
incidence of these serum sodium abnormalities
was significantly higher in the group with CPM
(X2 test = 8-949 with 3 degrees of freedom;
p < 005).
Discussion
CPM was first described in 1959 by Adams et
a12 and has subsequently been reviewed on
many occasions. The incidence in unselected
necropsy series varies from 0-16%" to 5-8%.5
About 10% of patients with chronic liver
disease may have histological evidence of
913
CPM,'7 although lesions are often small. We
have shown a similar incidence in liver trans￾plant recipients, including those transplanted
for chronic and acute liver disease, confirming
that this group has a high risk of developing
CPM. These findings are comparable with
those of the only other major study of CPM in
liver transplantation.32 Interestingly, two out of
our five cases were children, as were three out of
11 cases described by Estol et al.32 CPM in
children is rare outside the context of liver
transplantation.
Few cases of CPM are diagnosed in life,
although the routine use of computed tomo￾graphy scanning and magnetic resonance imag￾ing has increased diagnostic accuracy.' 33 34 The
classic features of "locked-in" syndrome￾quadriparesis and pseudobulbar palsy, are
often absent if the lesion is small, or may be
obscured by other neurological abnormalities.
This seems particularly so in liver transplant
recipients32 where the effects of hypoxia,35 sep￾sis,36 drug toxicity,37 38 metabolic derange￾ment39 4' and hepatic encephalopathy4l may
predominate. All our patients had a com￾plicated course with multi-organ failure and
polychemotherapy. None was diagnosed
before necropsy, reflecting not only the difficul￾ty in interpreting complex neurological signs
but also the relative underuse of advanced
imaging techniques in this country, compared
with America.'83242 It is, therefore, important
to consider the possibility of CPM in any
patient with neurological problems, or even
behavioural disorders,42 after liver transplanta￾tion.
We have found CPM in 10% of our necropsy
series; the condition was an important con￾tributor to death in three cases. In the absence
of other complications the other two probably
would have survived, though with unpredict￾able neurological deficits. As Pfister et al'
showed that clinical recovery from CPM was
possible, minor degrees of CPM may remain
undiagnosed in transplant survivors. Current￾ly, there are few studies of neuropsychiatric
function in long term liver transplant
survivors43 and the contribution ofoccult CPM
to overall morbidity is unknown. The collec￾tion of accurate data would require the routine
application of more sophisticated imaging
techniques than are presently available.32
Once established, CPM causes irreversible
structural cerebral damage. Prevention of this
common complication of liver transplantation
is therefore crucial. It is often implied that
CPM is a simple and direct consequence of a
"rapid" rise in serum sodium concentration,
with demyelination occurring as a result of
osmotic "stress". A "safe" upper limit of
12 mmol/l/day is cited.10 The results of this
study do not support this contention. Indeed,
in one of our cases (OL278/279) recorded
serum sodium values remained within normal
reference intervals during the entire clinical
course and in two others rises in serum sodium
were within conventional "safe" limits. Con￾versely, 16 patients with no evidence of CPM
showed rises greater than 12 mmol/l/day.
There was a similar lack of correlation with

respect to incidences of hypo- and hyper￾natraemia before and after transplantation.
The clinical and experimental evidence in
favour of some relation to
a combination of
these factors is, however, persuasive.'2 204"
It seems likely that individual variation in the
reaction of central nervous tissue to similar
degrees of osmotic stress must be very impor￾tant to the development of CPM. As patients
with liver disease are particularly susceptible,
liver failure may lead to disruption of astrocyte
metabolism with resulting abnormalities of
blood-brain barrier function and
a decreased
ability to generate new intracellular osmoles in
response to osmotic changes. Norenberg47 has
suggested that the aetiological factors may
interact through the pathogenic mechanisms
illustrated in fig 5. At present this is speculative,
but until these mechanisms are elucidated, and
vulnerable patients identified preoperatively, it
will not be possible to predict who might
develop CPM.
Meanwhile, major fluctuations in serum
sodium concentration in the perioperative
period should be avoided. Even moderate, but
sustained, rises should be identified at an early
stage. CPM must be looked for in patients who,
for whatever reason, do sustain such fluctua￾tions and should not be dismissed in those with
consistently "normal" sodium concentrations.
