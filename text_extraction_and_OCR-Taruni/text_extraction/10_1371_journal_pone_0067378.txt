Abstract
DNA methylation plays an important role in development of disease and the process of aging. In this study we examine
DNA methylation at 476,366 sites throughout the genome of white blood cells from a population cohort (N = 421) ranging
in age from 14 to 94 years old. Age affects DNA methylation at almost one third (29%) of the sites (Bonferroni adjusted P￾value ,0.05), of which 60.5% becomes hypomethylated and 39.5% hypermethylated with increasing age. DNA methylation
sites that are located within CpG islands (CGIs) more often become hypermethylated compared to sites outside an island.
CpG sites in promoters are more unaffected by age, whereas sites in enhancers more often becomes hypo- or
hypermethylated. Hypermethylated sites are overrepresented among genes that are involved in DNA binding, transcription
regulation, processes of anatomical structure and developmental process and cortex neuron differentiation (P-value down
to P = 9.14*10267). By contrast, hypomethylated sites are not strongly overrepresented among any biological function or
process. Our results indicate that the 23% of the variation in DNA methylation is attributed chronological age, and that
hypermethylation is more site-specific than hypomethylation. It appears that the change in DNA methylation partly overlap
with regions that change histone modifications with age, indicating an interaction between the two major epigenetic
mechanisms. Epigenetic modifications and change in gene expression over time most likely reflects the natural process of
aging and variation between individuals might contribute to the development of age-related phenotypes and diseases such
as type II diabetes, autoimmune and cardiovascular disease.

Introduction
Epigenetics is used to denote the regulation of gene transcrip￾tion that cannot be attributed to sequence variation in the DNA.
Although the term epigenetics includes a number of different
mechanisms, DNA methylation and histone modification are most
commonly discussed. DNA methylation in mammals appears to be
specific to cytosine, predominantly to CpG (cytosine-phosphate￾guanine) dinucleotides. In promoter regions, CpG sites are often
clustered in CpG islands (CGIs) were methylation is believed to
repress gene expression [1]. Even small changes in the methylation
of a promoter region can introduce stable changes in gene
expression, leading to silencing of a gene [2,3]. Recently, different
array- and sequence-based techniques for measuring of the
genome-wide DNA methylation pattern have been developed,
and the different techniques have yielded concordant results [4,5].
A number of environmental factors, such nutrition status,
exposure to drugs, pesticides and other compounds, have been
found to alter the epigenome [6]. A number of genomic regions
have been proposed to be differentially methylated between MZ
twins discordant for disorders such as schizophrenia [7], caudal
duplication anomalies [8], bipolar disorder [9], and systemic lupus
erythematosus [10]. More comprehensive genome-wide studies of
methylation using larger sample sizes have shown that changes in
DNA methylation pattern in the human brain and in blood
leukocytes [11–13] and in cord blood from newborn compared to
peripheral blood mononuclear in elderly [14], is highly correlated
with the chronological age.
Although most studies performed are based on a small number
of individuals or methylation sites, they point to the importance of
epigenetic modifications in the process of aging. The use of novel
methylation assays with a higher genomic resolution and larger
sample sizes spanning a wider age-range will greatly increase our
understanding of the relationship between the DNA methylation
level and chronological age. In this study we evaluate the effect of
chronological age on DNA methylation in 421 individuals aged 14
to 94 years, in which DNA methylation status in white blood cells
has been determined at more than 475,000 sites distributed
throughout the genome [15].
Materials and Methods
Study Population
The Northern Sweden Population Health Study (NSPHS) was
initiated in 2006 to provide a health survey of the population in
the Parishes of Karesuando and Soppero, County of Norrbotten,
and to study the medical consequences of lifestyle and genetics.
This parish has about 3000 inhabitants who meet the eligibility
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 June 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 6 | e67378

criteria in terms of age (.15 years) of which 1069 individuals
participated in the study. Studies of populations such as NSPHS
can be of great value for studying health effects of lifestyle and
genetic factors. In addition, rural individuals usually live in the
same environment over an extended time period, which increases
the health effects of their lifestyle but also make them optimal for
studying the long-term lifestyle and environmental effect on DNA
methylation. For each participant in the NSPHS, blood samples
were taken and immediately frozen and stored at 270 C.
Genomic DNA for methylation analyses was extracted from
previously frozen peripheral blood leukocytes using a phenol:-
chloroform protocol. More information about the NSPHS has
been published previously [16]. The NSPHS study was approved
by the local ethics committee at the University of Uppsala
(Regionala Etik pro¨vnings na¨mnden, Uppsala, Dnr 2005:325) in
compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants gave
their written informed consent to the study including the
examination of environmental and genetic causes of disease. In
case the participant was not full age, a legal guardian signed
additionally. The procedure which was used to obtain informed
consent and the respective informed consent form has been
recently discussed in the light of present ethical guidelines [17].
Since we are working with a study cohort from a limited area,
deposition of the raw data might allow for person identification.
Due to concerns regarding patient privacy and protection, we are
therefor unable to deposit the raw data to a central repository.
However, data will be made available to researchers upon request.
[17].
Determination of DNA Methylation Status
Genomic DNA was bisulfite-converted using an EZ DNA
methylation Kit (ZYMO research) according to the manufactur￾er’s recommendations. The methylation status of the genomic
DNA was then assessed using he Human Methylation450
BeadChip, (Illumina, San Diego, USA) according to the standard
protocol. Analysis of the raw data was performed using Illumina
GenomeStudio 2009, using the recommended settings from
Illumina and the HumanMethylation450_15017482_v.1.2.bpm
manifest file. The quality control (QC) parameters recommended
by Illumina were used (Individual Probe Call rate .0.98, marker
detection P-value , = 0.01).
Transcription Profiling Data
Transcription profiling data from whole blood for 99 healthy
US controls individuals from the PREDICT trial (http://www.
clinicaltrials.gov, accession number: NCT00500617) together with
information of gender and birth date were downloaded from the
ArrayExpress database (www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress, accessed 14
October, 2012) under accession number E-GEOD-20686. This
data were produced using Agilent Whole Human Genome
Microarray 4644K 014850 G4112F, (Agilent Technologies Inc,
Americas). Description on sample preparation and processing of
transcription data has been published previously [18]. Gene
annotations for the probes were obtained using the Ensembl
database (http://www.ensembl.org, accessed –14, October 2012).
Statistic Analyses of DNA Methylation Data
All statistic analyses were performed using the stats library of R
version 2.15.0 [19]. Methylation values were reported as average
beta values, which represent the ratio of array intensity signal
obtained from the methylated beads over the sum of methylated
and unmethylated beads (or the fraction of DNA fragments that
are methylated at a specific site for an individual). Beta values for
each marker were fitted to a linear model using chronological age,
sex and bmi as covariables. We also tested for interaction between
age and sex by using the same model and including the sex*age
interaction term. No plate/batch effect were seen and conse￾quently not included in the model. Wilcox-rank sum test were used
to compare median values for not normally distributed traits. The
terminology: hypomethylated is used for sites that decrease in
methylation by age and hypermethylated for sites that increase in
methylation by age. Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing was
used when determining if a site was hypo- or hypermethylated.
Modal clustering was performed for each site separately using the
Modalclust library [20], without any assumptions of the underly￾ing number of modes and memberships and using a smoothing
factor of 0.05. To compare the number of modes with the
presence of genetic polymorphisms, SNP information were
downloaded from the 1000 Genomes reference panels represent￾ing the 23 Nov 2010 (low-coverage genomes) and 21 May 2011
(high-coverage exomes) accessed from the IMPUTE-web resource
(http://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/impute/
data_download_1000G_phase1_integrated.html) March21, 2013.
Only 1000 Genomes SNPs with a minor allele frequency of 0.01 in
European populations were included in the analyses.
Statistic Analyses of Transcription Data
Linear regression was performed for transcription data using
chronological age and sex as covariables. For the transcription
data, a cut-off of P = 0.05 were used to determine if the gene
expression increased/decreased by age. Chi-square test were used
to test for enrichment of genes that increase or decrease in
expression by age among the most hyper- and hypomethylated
genes relative other genes.
Functional Analyses of DNA Methylation Sites
Annotation of DNA methylation sites were provided by
Illumina (www.illumina.com, HumanMethyla￾tion450_15017482_v.1.1.csv, accessed: 1st September, 2012) as
described previously [15] or downloaded from the UCSC genome
bioinformatics site (http://genome.ucsc.edu, Feb. 2009
(GRCh37/hg19) release, accessed: 1st September, 2012). The
definition of a CGI used were: length .200 bp, GC content
. = 50% or greater observed to expected number of CG
dinucleotide .0.6. CpG sites located in Island shores are located
0–2 kb and shelves 2–4 kb from an island. N shore and shelves are
located upstream and S shores and shelves are located downstream
of an island. Chromatin states in blood cells [21] were downloaded
from the UCSC genome bioinformatics site (http://genome.ucsc.
edu, Feb. 2009 (GRCh37/hg19) release, accessed: 1st September,
2012).
Selection of the most Hyper- and Hypomethylated CGIs
Each autosomal CGI with more than three measured CpG sites
(N = 25045) were analyzed for fraction of sites were the
methylation level was positively (correlation coefficient .0 and
Bonferroni adjusted P-value ,0.05) or negatively (correlation
coefficient ,0 and Bonferroni adjusted P-value ,0.05) correlated
with age. The CGIs were ranked according to the fraction of sites
in each category (hypo- or hypermethylated). The top 500 were
included in the gene ontology analyses. Gene annotations for the
CGIs were provided by Illumina (www.illumina.com, Human￾Methylation450_15017482_v.1.1.csv, accessed: 1st September,
2012).

Biological Function and Gene Ontology Analyses
Gene ontology analyses were performed using GORILLA
(Gene Ontology enRIchment anaLysis and visuaLizAtion tool)
[22] for autosomal markers only. A CGI might not be linked to
any known gene or be linked to a number of different genes with
similar functions. To avoid introducing a bias from genes of similar
function tending to cluster to the same chromosomal location, only
one gene for each CGI was randomly included in the final gene
lists of 500 candidates.
Results
A total of 476,366 markers (98.10%) and all individuals
(N = 421, Probe Call rate ranging from 99.72% to 99.99%) passed
the QC. The median age among individuals was 44 years, ranging
from 14 to 94 (Figure 1A). The distribution of DNA methylation
levels shows, that among autosomal markers, as many sites are
unmethylated (methylation level ,0.25) as are methylated
(methylation level .0.75) (Figure 1B and C). The distribution of
DNA methylation levels differs somewhat between males and
females for the autosomes (Figure 1B), with a slightly lower median
autosomal methylation level for males (p-value = 0.031). No
difference in quantile or mean autosomal methylation levels is
seen between sexes. By contrast, the pattern for the X￾chromosome differs dramatically between sexes (Figure 1D). This
is in agreement with imprinting of a large fraction of the X
chromosome in females giving rise to a large fraction of hemi￾methylated sites in females (methylation level .0.3 and ,0.7) in
combination with the pseudo autosomal region of the X￾chromosome with unmethylated (methylation,0.25) or methylat￾ed (methylation .0.75) sites also in females. The methylation
pattern of autosomes differs between the youngest and oldest
participants in our study (Figure 1C). The mean autosomal
methylation level decreases with age (R = 20.191, p-value = 8.05e￾05), but the most significant difference is the increase of the 1st
quantile (R = 0.406, p-value ,2.2E-16) and decrease in median
(R = 20.439, p-value ,2.2E-16) and the 3rd quantile (R = 20.429,
p-value ,2.2E-16), similar to that seen in Figure 1A.
Modal Clustering
A number of factors might influence if the distribution of
methylation levels will be unimodal, bimodal or polymodal
(including multiple distributions with different mean/median).
The most obviously pattern is the imprinted part of the X
chromosome, were most males will appear to be unmethylated
compared to female who are hemimethylated at most sites
(Figure 1D). In this case we expect a bimodal distributions for
most X chromosomal sites, with the mean of the first mode (males)
being close to 0 (unmethylated) and the second mode (females)
being close to 0.5 (hemimethylated). Another scenario is the case
of having an SNP in the CpG site. A polymorphism in one of these
positions might lead to poor or no methylation. Also SNPs located
within the sequence of the DNA probe used for genotyping might
affect the specificity of a probe and differences in intensities
between different alleles. Most of the autosomal sites (94.7%) in
our data are monomodal (Table 1). However, a number of sites
are bimodal (4.6%), whereas only few sites were trimodal (0.74%),
or had more than three modes (0.023%). Unfortunately, we do not
have complete SNP information for the regions surrounding the
DNA methylation sits. However, we can determine that a
significantly (P-value = 3.3e-246) higher fraction (28.1%) of the
trimodal sites overlap with a known 1000 Genomes SNP located at
the DNA methylation site, compared to only 6.5% for the bimodal
sites and 0.5% of the unimodal. Similarly, a significantly (P￾value = 7.8e-148) higher fraction of bimodal trimodal sites (45.4%)
overlap with a 1000 Genomes SNP located within 1 bp from the
DNA methylation site measured, as compared to 7.5% for the
bimodal and 0.75% for the unimodal. However the frequency of
sites with an SNP located 2 bp from the DNA methylation site
measured is more similar between trimodal, bimodal and
unimodal sites (0.75%, 0.72% and 0.45% respectively). This
suggests that underlying SNPs might account for a large fraction of
the variation in the bi- and especially tri- modal DNA methylation
sites.
Principal Component Analyses
Principal component analyses of all autosomal markers show
that only the first four principal components (PCs) each explains
more than 1% of the variance among the beta values (61,1%,
20.3%, 4.2%, and 1.4% for PC 1–4 respectively). All other PCs
explain less than 1% of the variation each. Together the first four
PCs account for 87.1% of the total variance in DNA methylation
(Table 2). All the first four PCs are strongly correlated (p,2.65E￾06) with chronological age, with a Rhoˆ2 ranging from 0.051 to
0.278. To estimate the fraction of variation in DNA methylation
that can be attributed age, we extrapolated these numbers. Since
age explains Rhoˆ2 = 20.528ˆ2 = 27.9% of the variation in PC #1
and PC #1 explains 61,1% of the variation in the DNA
methylation, we can estimate that age explains 27.9%
*61.1% = 17% of the variation in DNA methylation based on
only looking at PC #1. If calculating the sum of these variances for
PC1–4, we can estimate that age account for more than 23% of
the variation in methylation level among the autosomal sites.
DNA Methylation and Correlation with Chronological
Age
For as many as 29.0% of the sites (137993), the methylation
level is significantly (P-value ,1.049613e-07, Bonferroni adjusted
P-value ,0.05) correlated with age (Supporting information Table
S1). For the majority of these sites (60.5%) methylation decrease
(hypomethylation) with age and for remaining (39.5%) methyla￾tion increase (hypermethylation). For 37.8% of all sites, the
methylation level was not correlated (Nominal P-value .0.05)
with age. For most sites influenced by age, DNA methylation
increase/decrease approximately linear with age. The strongest
positive correlation of methylation with age is seen for cg16867657
(R = 0.957, P-value = 1.20e-228), which is located in a CGI in the
promoter of ELOVL2 (Figure 2), were the methylation level
ranges from 0.352 in the youngest to 0.891 in the oldest individual.
It is interesting to note that the distribution of methylation levels
for the cg16867657 site were estimated to be bimodal with means
u = 0. 491 and u = 0.625, as a consequence of the uneven
distribution in age among individuals and an increased number
of individuals with an age around 17, 45 or 67 years of age
(Figure 1A). In addition to being age-dependent, significant
interactions between sex and age was observed (Bonferroni
adjusted P-value ,0.05) for 163 sites, of which 152 were located
on the X chromosome. This low number of significant interactions
indicates that the effect of age on DNA methylation is similar in
males and females for most sites.
Functional Analyses of Marker Locations
The Human Methylation450 BeadChip is designed to target
more or less all well-defined CGIs in the human genome. In total,
27110 CGIs are targeted with at least one of the markers that
passed the QC in our analyses. In total, 304217 (63.9%) of the
markers overlap with a CGI, with an average of 17.5 markers
Aging of the Human DNA Methylome

(median = 10) per island, ranging from 1 to 166 markers. As many
as 21153 genes are targeted by at least one CpG site, 15930 by a
CGI and 10128 genes have at least one CpG site in the promoter.
Among the sites that become hypermethylated with age, 81.4%
are located in a CGI, compared to only 2.8% for the
hypomethylated sites (Figure 3A). On the other hand, CpGs
located in S shelf or N shelf, very rarely become hypermethylated
by age, whereas the frequency of S shore and N shore sites is more
evenly distributed over the spectra of correlation coefficients. This
agrees with previous studies using another chip (Infinium
HumanMethylation27 BeadChip) with larger fractions of CGIs,
showing that a larger fraction of sites become hypermethylated by
age [13]. While the fraction of sites located within CGIs increase
with increasing correlation coefficient, there is also a peak
representing a large fraction of sites in CGIs with a correlation
coefficient close to zero (Figure 3A). This peak is mainly due to
promoter sites (Figure 3B), which appear to be more conserved in
the DNA methylation level throughout the years compared to e.g.
enhancer sites. The same peak is also found for sites located
200 bp upstream of the transcription starting site, 59 UTR and the
first exon, whereas a larger fraction of the sites are located in gene
bodies and 39UTRs appear to become hypomethylated over time
(Figure 3C). It is also seen that longer CGIs more often become
hypermethylated by age (Figure 4A), and that the fraction of
observed CpG sites compared to the content of C and G
nucleotides is highest for sites that are not correlated with age and
sites where the methylation level is positively correlated with age
(Figure 4 B and C).

Ernst and Kheradpour [21] define, in blood cells, two types of
strong enhancers; chromatin state 4, which is defined by locations
having H3K4me1/2/3 and acetylated H3K27 and H3K9, and
chromatin state 5, which is defined as having H3K4me1/2,
acetylated H3K27 and to some degree acetylated H3K9. While
DNA methylation in chromatin that has been annotated as being
active promoters (state 1), appears to be less affected by age in our
data, we find that strong enhancers of state 4 is predominately
found among hypermethylated sites and enhancers of state 5
among hypomethylated sites (Figure 5).
Gene Ontology Analyses
The genes with hypermethylated CGIs are overrepresented in
some molecular functions and cellular processes. The most
enriched molecular functions involve DNA binding and transcrip￾tion regulation, which are enriched almost eight times (P-value
down to P = 9.14E-67) for hypermethylated genes (Supporting
information Figure S1 and Table S2). Similarly, a large number of
biological processes are enriched for hypermethylated genes (P￾values down to 3.19E-49), including processes of anatomical
structure and developmental process, pattern specification process,
and regionalization and neurological functions. For example,

cerebral cortex neuron differentiation is over 30 times enriched for
hypermethylated genes (Supporting information Table S3, and
Figure S2). The genes that become hypomethylated with age do
not show any strong enrichment for specific functions or processes
(Supporting information Table S4, Table S5, Figure S3 and
Figure S4).
Gene Expression and Chronological Age
We wanted to investigate if genes that become hyper- of
hypomethylated also show a more distinct change expression with
chronological age. A total of 28984 out of 41049 expression probes
mapped to a gene with an official gene name provided by Ensembl
and could be mapped to our most hypo- or hyper-methylated gene
associated CGIs. Among the 500 most hypermethylated CGIs,
412 are associated with a gene that is also targeted by at least one
expression probe. Similarly, among the 500 most hypomethylated
CGI, 407 are associated with a gene that is also targeted by at least
one of the expression probes. Among the 28984 probes that are
mapped to a gene name, a slightly higher fraction (16.0%)
decrease compared to increase (13.3%) expression with age
(p = 2.29e-21). For the genes that become hypermethylated by
age, a much larger fraction (26.94%) decrease in expression with
age and a much smaller fraction increase in expression by age
(2.91%) compared to the average (Chi2 test P-value = 2.49e-09
and 6.55e-10 respectively). Interestingly, also for genes that
become hypomethylated by age, a much larger fraction (24.8%)
decrease in expression with age and a much smaller fraction
increase in expression by age (6.88%) compared to the average
(Chi2 test P-value = 1.807e-06 and 0.000158 respectively). These
results suggest that both hyper- and hypo methylation by age can
result in a decrease of expression, probably by different regulatory
mechanisms.
Discussion
In this study we have shown that chronological age plays an
important role in the pattern of DNA methylation in white blood
cells. More than 23% of the total variation in autosomal DNA
methylation, or over 90% of the variation at individual sites, can
be attributed to chronological age. As many as 29% of the sites
surveyed were influenced by age using a stringent cut-off for
significance (Bonferroni adjusted P-value ,0.05). Our estimate is
higher compared to previously studies [11,12], mainly due to the
larger number of sites investigated, the larger sample size, and the
wide range in age between subjects. The distribution of mean
methylation level per site also differs between age-stratified groups.
It appears that in younger individuals a larger fraction of sites are
either hypo- or hypermethylated, whereas for older individuals
sites that were initially hypomethylated increase in methylation
level, and sites that were initially hypermethylated decrease in
methylation level. This indicates that there is a change in
methylation level with age, from an initial hyper- or hypomethy￾lated state and towards hemimethylation. Interestingly, a lower
number of sites appear to become hyper- as compared to
hypomethylated by age.
For a large fraction of the sites (38%), the methylation level did
not correlate with age (nominal p.0.05). Many factors might
result in lack of a correlation, including methodological issues
(typing quality), strong influences on the methylation level by other
(as yet unidentified) factors (e.g. diet and lifestyle), and bi- or
polymodal distributions (e.g. due to SNPs). In addition, we do
observe a higher fraction of sites in repetitive regions (chromatin
state 15) that are not affected by age (Figure 5) suggesting that
many of theses sites might not be related to gene regulation.
However, it is reasonable to believe that some sites might be
subjected to strict conservation of the methylation pattern
throughout the lifetime. Interestingly, we observe a peak of sites

with correlation coefficient close to zero to be enriched for sites
located in CGIs (Figure 3A) and in active promoters (Figure 3B
and Figure 5). This might suggest that the DNA methylation
pattern of promoters is more conserved through life and that
changes in the methylation pattern of promoters are more likely to
be associated with a phenotype in humans.
There is a clear overrepresentation of specific biological
functions among hypermethylated genes compared to almost no
overrepresented functions of processes among hypomethylated
genes. Together these results indicate that hypermethylation with
age is more site- and gene-specific, and that hypomethylation is
likely to occur more sporadically at sites with a less central role in
regulating gene transcription. This agrees well with previous
studies showing that the methylation level correlates with
chromatin accessibility, and that the most variably methylated
CpGs are often found in gene bodies and intragenic regions rather
than in promoters and upstream regulatory regions. While DNA
methylation of promoters is generally regarded as repressing gene
expression, methylation of genic regions has been correlated to
increased transcriptional activity [1]. This might explain our
observation that the pattern of more stable methylation or
hypermethylation by age in regions close to the transcription start
site, as compared to the hypomethylation seen at sites in gene
bodies (Figure 3). This pattern suggests that transcription at many
genes is reduced with increased chronological age, which agrees
with our observation from transcription profiling data, where both
hyper- and hypermethylated genes are enriched for lower
transcription levels by age.
The change in methylation pattern is dependent on the balance
between modifying and demodifying enzymes. Most of the enzyme
activity in the process of copying the methylation pattern during
replication is attributed to the DNMT1 methyltransferase. Other
known components in DNA methylation pattern are de novo
methyltransferases, DNMT3A and DNMT3B [23]. The mecha￾nisms of DNA methylation also agree with hypomethylation being
a failure (which might be more pronounced at some sites) to copy
the methylation pattern, while de novo methylation acts in a site￾specific manner. The fact that the average gene expression level
decrease by age and that decreased levels of DNMT1 and other
enzymes has been shown to result in genome-wide loss of CpG
methylation [24], support our results of the larger number and less
site specificity of hypomethylation.
Another functional difference between sites that become hypo￾or hypermethylated by age is that hypermethylated sites more
often map to regions that have been suggested to represent strong
enhancer of chromatin state 4, as compared to hypomethylated
sites that mainly map to strong enhancers of chromatin state 5 in
blood cells (Figure 5). State 4 and state 5 strong enhancers mainly
differ by state 4 having trimethylated lysine 4 of histone H3
(H3K4me3) and acetylated lysine 9 of histone H3 at (H3K9ac)
[21]. Our results of a positive correlation between hypermethyla￾tion by age and H3K4me3 in blood cells agree with other studies
[12]. However it has previously been shown that H3K4me3
inhibits the binding and activity of the de novo methylation enzymes
DNMT3A/B [25]. This does not agree with our results of state 4
enhancers (being H3K4me3) being more prone to hypermethyla￾tion. However, it has also been shown that both H3K4me3 and
H3K9ac decrease with age, at least in brain tissue [26,27], which
could result in higher activation of DNMT3A/B followed by
hypermethylation of state 4 enhancers, which does agree with our
results. It is of interest to note that the gene ontologies that were
enriched for H3K4me3 methylation specific to newborns [27]
overlap with the ontologies that we find to become hypermethy￾lated by age. Also, out of 557 genes that were H3K4me3 specific
to the newborn, a significantly larger fraction (5.9% compared to
2.7%) overlap with the genes becoming hyper- as compared to
hypomethylated by age in our study (Fisher Exact Test one tailed
P-value = 0.0045). Similarly, out of 92 genes that are H3K4me3
specific at higher age [27] five overlapped with our hypo- and
none with our hypermethylated genes (Fisher Exact Test one
tailed P-value = 0.030). The age-related changes in histone
modification and the association between age-dependent histone

modifications and age-dependent DNA methylation are poorly
understood [28]. Our results indicate that the epigenetic
mechanisms that reduce gene expression throughout our lifespan
are shared between different tissues. In addition, our results
suggest that the changes in the epigenetic pattern by chronological
age is to some extent correlated between DNA methylation and
histone modifications. One explanation could be that for some
genes that become less active with age, H3K4me3 decrease
followed by enhanced de novo DNA methylation.
Compared to most studies on DNA methylation, which are
performed in vitro on specific cell types, our study was performed
on white blood cells (WBC) from peripheral blood samples from a
population-based cohort. WBC represent a mixture of cell types
and we cannot exclude that some of our findings are due to age￾dependent change in the composition of different cell-types rather
than average change in DNA methylation over all cell-types. It has
been shown that DNA methylation vary depending on cell
composition, an effect that is pronounced in immune system￾related diseases [29,30]. In previous studies, the white blood cell
counts (WBC) for the most common cell types (neutrophils,
eosinophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes) have been compared to
DNA methylation levels [12]. These results indicate that only a
small fraction (3.9%) of the sites are influenced by lymphocyte
counts, and no sites are correlated with the counts of the other cell
types. Since we are using samples from a healthy population based
cohort in combination with the fact that age-dependent differential
methylation is shared between cell types cells [31], the variability
in WBC sub-types is not likely to exert a major effect on our results
on the effect of chronological age on DNA methylation.
Many age-related diseases, such as coronary artery disease,
atherosclerosis, and chronic inflammation are tightly linked to
inflammatory processes, were white blood cells play an important
role. Variability in hundreds of genes contributes to the
susceptibility of these diseases. Altered DNA methylation pattern
in blood cells might result in variation in gene transcription and
subsequent increased or decrease of the amount of gene product.
This regulation might play an important role in the inflammatory
process, when the immune cells release a large number of
inflammatory markers. It is reasonable to believe that signal
molecules that are released as an indication of inflammation might
be up- or down- regulated due to variation in the DNA
methylation pattern, resulting in an accelerated (or decelerated)
immune response to a pathogen, or even a response without being
triggered by a pathogen. A large fraction of hypermethylated CpG
sites in elderly might result in repression of genes that are
important for maintaining health. A better understanding of the
changes in DNA methylation through a person’s lifespan might
lead to better prevention and treatment of age-related diseases.
The strong effect of age on DNA methylation could also introduce
a bias in studies of the DNA methylation pattern in diseases, when
cases and controls are not carefully age-matched, a factor that
needs to be considered in early study design.
