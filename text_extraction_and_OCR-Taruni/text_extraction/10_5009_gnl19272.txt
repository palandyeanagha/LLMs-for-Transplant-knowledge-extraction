Background/Aims: This study aimed to investigate the epi￾demiology of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in the Korean 
general population and the awareness and treatment status 
of HCV infection among anti-HCV-positive persons. Methods:
We used data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (KNHNES) collected between 2012 and 
2016. All the participants aged ≥10 years in the KNHNES 
were tested for the anti-HCV antibody. Anti-HCV-positive 
persons were tested for HCV RNA and assessed for their 
awareness and treatment experience regarding HCV infec￾tion. Results: The prevalence of anti-HCV was 0.66% (95% 
confidence interval, 0.56% to 0.78%) among Koreans aged 
≥10 years, representing an estimated 278,819 anti-HCV-pos￾itive persons, and 0.71% (95% confidence interval, 0.60% to 
0.84%) among Koreans aged ≥20 years. The prevalence of 
anti-HCV increased with age and had significant geographic 
variation. The positive rate of HCV RNA in anti-HCV-positive 
persons was 33.5% and increased with age. The rate of 
HCV infection awareness was 15.2% (35/250) among anti￾HCV-positive persons and 30.5% (18/59) among HCV RNA￾positive persons. Among the participants, 13.5% of HCV 
RNA-positive persons had been treated for HCV infection. 
Conclusions: The prevalence of anti-HCV among Koreans 
aged ≥20 years was 0.71%; one-third of anti-HCV-positive 
persons tested HCV RNA-positive. The awareness and treat￾ment rates of HCV infection were low among HCV-infected 
persons. Therefore, active measures should be taken to 
diagnose and treat persons unaware of HCV infection. (Gut

INTRODUCTION
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of liver cir￾rhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and affects at least 
71 million people worldwide.1
 It insidiously progresses to liver 
cirrhosis over 20 to 30 years and leads to a 1% to 7% annual 
risk of HCC and a 3% to 6% annual risk of hepatic decompen￾sation.2
Considering that the current HCV therapies, direct-acting an￾tiviral agents (DAAs), have shown a remarkably high cure rate 
of over 90%,3,4 early diagnosis and treatment before the onset 
of advanced liver fibrosis or cirrhosis are key to reducing the 
HCV-related morbidity and mortality rate. However, most HCV￾infected patients are asymptomatic, and they are diagnosed at 
advanced symptomatic stages including decompensated cirrho￾sis or HCC. Only about 20% of HCV-infected persons are aware 
of their infection status, and only 7% of patients diagnosed with 
chronic hepatitis C have initiated antiviral therapy.1
 In response 
to the “HCV cascade of care,” the World Health Organization 
has advocated for an HCV elimination strategy aimed at achiev￾ing a 65% reduction in the HCV-associated mortality rate and 
an 80% reduction in HCV incidence by diagnosing 90% of 
HCV-infected persons and treating 80% of eligible people by 
2030.5
 The strategy emphasized comprehension of the national 
and subnational epidemiology to screen hidden HCV infections. 
The epidemiology of HCV infection varies among and within 
countries.
The anti-HCV prevalence in Korea has been reported to range 
from 0.41% to 2.1% among studies, most of which were limited 
by the representativeness of their study populations.6,7 The only 
nationwide study conducted in 2009 reported an HCV serop￾revalence of 0.76%. Moreover, there are no nationwide studies 
on the awareness and treatment rate of HCV infection in the

Korean general population.
In light of the clinical significance of HCV infection, the Ko￾rean government introduced tests and questionnaire surveys 
for HCV infection into the Korea National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (KNHNES) in 2012 for the first time. 
This study aimed to investigate the nationwide population￾based prevalence of anti-HCV and HCV RNA, and the aware￾ness and treatment status of HCV infection by analyzing the 
KNHNES data from 2012 to 2016.
MTERIALS AND METHODS
1. Data source and study population
This study used data from the KNHNES from 2012 to 2016. 
The KNHNES is a national surveillance system that has been as￾sessing the health and nutritional status of Koreans since 1998. 
This nationally representative cross-sectional survey assesses 
approximately 10,000 individuals each year as a survey sample 
and collects information on socioeconomic status, health-relat￾ed behaviors, quality of life, health utilization, anthropometric 
measures, biochemical and clinical profiles for non-communi￾cable diseases, and dietary intake via a health interview.8
 The 
survey involves a complex, stratified, multistage probability 
sample of the non-institutionalized Korean civilian population.

The KNHNES introduced anti-HCV antibody tests for indi￾viduals aged ≥10 years from 2012 to 2016 and serum HCV 
RNA tests for anti-HCV-positive persons from 2012 to 2015. 
Anti-HCV antibody tests were performed using chemilumines￾cent microparticle immunoassay (Architect anti-HCV, Abbott 
Diagnostics, Germany) and HCV RNA was assayed via real-time 
polymerase chain reaction (Cobas AmpliPrep/Cobas TaqMan 
System, Roche, Germany). Survey questionnaires regarding the 
awareness and treatment of HCV infection were also adminis￾tered to anti-HCV-positive persons. 
Written informed consent was provided by all participants of 
the KNHNES. The protocols for KNHNES were approved by the 
institutional review board of the Korea Centers for Disease Con￾trol and Prevention. The study protocol was approved by the 
Institutional Review Board of Inje University Ilsan Paik Hospital, 
Republic of Korea (IRB number: 2019-06-017). 
2. Data analyses
The anti-HCV antibody prevalence was assessed according to 
age, sex, area of residence, education level, family income, and 
serum level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT). The proportions 
of HCV RNA positivity and its associated factors were assessed 
among anti-HCV-positive individuals. 
The awareness rate was defined as the ratio of the number of 
individuals who had been diagnosed with hepatitis C by a doc￾tor to the number of anti-HCV-positive or HCV RNA-positive 
individuals. The treatment rate was defined as the ratio of the 
number of individuals who had been treated for hepatitis C to 
the number of anti-HCV-positive or HCV RNA-positive indi￾viduals.
3. Statistical analyses
To obtain representative estimates of the non-institutionalized 
Korean civilian population, the anti-HCV prevalence was as￾sessed by applying survey sample weights which were con￾structed for sample participants to represent the Korean popu￾lation by accounting for the complex survey design, survey 
non-response and post-stratification. The weights based on the 
inverse of selection probabilities and inverse of response rates 
were modified by adjusting them to the sex- and age-specific 
Korean populations.8
Univariable logistic regression analyses were performed to 
compare the prevalence of anti-HCV among demographic and 
socioeconomic factors. Multivariable logistic regression was 
used to estimate the odds ratios of anti-HCV seroprevalence 
while controlling for covariates. Continuous variables were as￾sessed using the t-test and categorical variables were compared 
using the chi-square test. Statistical analyses were performed 
using SPSS version 25 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All p￾values were two-sided, and p<0.05 was considered statistically 
significant.

2012 to 2016 (6,308 in 2012, 5,938 in 2013, 5,518 in 2014, 
5,856 in 2015, and 6,546 in 2016). Anti-HCV was positive in 
246 persons among 29,920 population. The weighted count of 
the study population was 42,187,199 (mean age, 42.5; male to 
female ratio, 1.03). The weighted count of anti-HCV-positive 
persons was 278,819 (mean age, 55.1; male to female ratio, 0.93) 
(Table 1). The weighted anti-HCV prevalence among Koreans 
aged ≥10 years was 0.66% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56% 
to 0.78%) and 0.71% among Koreans aged ≥20 years (95% CI, 
0.60% to 0.84%). The anti-HCV prevalence did not differ be￾tween males and females.
The age-specific anti-HCV prevalence was 0.32% (95% CI, 
0.15% to 0.67%) among individuals aged 10 to 19 years, 0.17% 
(95% CI, 0.08% to 0.40%) among those aged 20 to 29 years, 0.23% 
(95% CI, 0.13% to 0.41%) among those aged 30 to 39 years, 0.60% 
(95% CI, 0.39% to 0.92%) among those aged 40 to 49 years, 0.98% 
(95% CI, 0.69% to 1.40%) among those aged 50 to 59 years, 1.07% 
(95% CI, 0.80% to 1.44%) among those aged 60 to 69 years, and 
1.93% (95% CI, 1.47% to 2.53%) among those aged 70 years or 
older. Both the unadjusted and adjusted age-specific anti-HCV 
prevalence rates increased with age (Table 2).
There were significant differences in HCV seroprevalence 
among the various regions. The crude anti-HCV prevalence was 
significantly higher in Chungbuk, Busan, and Gyeongnam com￾pared with Seoul. It was significantly higher in the southeastern 
area of Korea encompassing Busan (1.06%), Gyeongnam (1.46%), 
and Ulsan (1.10%) compared with Seoul (0.49%) after adjusting 
for age (Table 3).
2. Risk factors for anti-HCV positivity
In the univariable analysis, the HCV seroprevalence was 
significantly higher in the settings of old age, rural areas, low 
family income, and education level below high school. How￾ever, only old age and education level below high school were 
significantly associated with a high prevalence of HCV infection 
in the multivariable analysis (Table 2). 
The anti-HCV prevalence was also significantly higher in per￾sons with serum ALT levels ≥40 U/L compared with those with 
ALT levels <40 U/L (1.29% vs 0.60%; odds ratio, 2.69). 
3. Prevalence of HCV RNA positivity
The HCV RNA was assayed in 187 out of 188 anti-HCV￾positive persons from 2012 to 2015. The serum HCV RNA 
was detected in 33.5% of anti-HCV-positive persons (63/188) 
(Table 4). The weighted count of HCV RNA-positive persons 
was estimated to be 81,596. Eight HCV RNA-positive and three 
HCV RNA-negative persons had been treated for hepatitis C. 
The HCV RNA positivity rate increased with age (p=0.024) 
but was not different between males and females (Table 4). In 
multivariable logistic analysis, only age is a risk factor for HCV 
RNA positivity (Supplementary Table 1). Elevated serum ALT 
levels were significantly more frequent in HCV RNA-positive 
persons compared with HCV RNA-negative persons (33.3% vs 
9.7%, p<0.001). The anti-HCV signal-to-cutoff (S/CO) ratio was 
significantly higher in HCV RNA-positive persons compared 
with HCV RNA-negative persons (13.99±2.26 vs 3.43±3.44, 
p<0.001). 
4. Awareness and treatment rate of HCV infection
The response rates to the questionnaires regarding the aware￾ness and treatment experience of hepatitis C were both 93.5% 
(230/246). Among anti-HCV-positive persons, 15.2% (35/230) 
had been diagnosed with hepatitis C by a doctor and 5.2% 
(12/230) had been treated for hepatitis C. Two persons were di￾agnosed with liver cancer (0.8%) and five were diagnosed with 
liver cirrhosis (2.1%). The awareness and treatment rates were 
30.5% (18/59) and 13.5% (8/59) among HCV RNA-positive per￾sons from 2012 to 2015 (Table 5).
There were no differences in the awareness rate of HCV infec￾tion according to age, sex, economic status, education level, and

area of residence among anti-HCV-positive persons. However, a 
higher education level was associated with a higher awareness 
among HCV RNA-positive persons. The awareness rate of hepa￾titis C was significantly higher in HCV RNA-positive persons 
compared with HCV RNA negative persons (30.5% vs 8.8%, 
p<0.001) and tended to be higher in persons with ALT level ≥40 
U/L compared to those with serum ALT level <40 U/L (25.0% vs 
13.4%, p=0.082) (Table 5).
DISCUSSION
This study investigated the population-based prevalence of 
anti-HCV and HCV RNA using nationwide representative data. 
The anti-HCV prevalence for Korea has been reported to range 
from 0.41% to 2.1% among studies, most of which were limited 
by the representativeness of their study populations.6,7 A most 
recent nationwide study on HCV seroprevalence using data of 
around 30,000 health check-up examinees in 2009 reported 
an anti-HCV prevalence of 0.78% among Koreans older than 
20 years.7
 The anti-HCV prevalence from 2012 to 2016 in this 
study was 0.71% among Koreans aged ≥20 years and 0.66% 
among those aged ≥10 years, which is similar to the results of a 
previous study conducted in 2009. 
The anti-HCV prevalence increased with age and showed a 
seroprevalence of 0.17% among persons aged 20 to 29 years 
and 1.93% among those aged 70 years or older, which was also 
consistent with the results of previous studies.6,7 In the univari￾able analysis, residence in a rural area and low family income 
were significantly associated with a higher HCV seroprevalence 
although these associations were attenuated in the multivariable

analysis, suggesting that these factors were associated with old 
age. An education level below high school was significantly as￾sociated with HCV seroprevalence even after adjusting for age. 
There was also a consistent geographic variation in the prev￾alence of anti-HCV reported in the previous study.7
 The reason 
for this geographic variation in Korea is unclear, but it was 
reported that risky behaviors were more frequent in prevalent 
areas.9
As expected, the HCV seroprevalence was higher among per￾sons with ALT level ≥40 U/L compared with those with ALT lev￾el <40 U/L (1.29% vs 0.60%). It was reported that about 30% to 
40% of patients with chronic hepatitis C had persistently normal 
ALT levels.10,11 In this study, 82.4% of anti-HCV positive and 
66.7% of HCV RNA-positive persons had serum ALT levels <40 
U/L, which seemed higher compared with the reports of previous 
studies although ALT was measured only one time in this study. 
When stricter cutoff levels are applied (34 U/L for men and 30 
U/L for women), less than half of HCV RNA-positive persons 
had elevated ALT levels. This finding confirms the limitation of 
liver biochemistry alone in detecting HCV infection. 
There are few studies on the prevalence of HCV RNA positiv￾ity in the Korean general population. A study using the data of 
blood donors reported that only 5.3% of anti-HCV-positive per￾sons had detectable serum HCV RNA levels,12 whereas a study 
of health check-up examinees reported an HCV RNA-positivity 
rate of 56.1% among anti-HCV-positive persons.7
 The serum 
HCV RNA positivity rate among anti-HCV-positive persons was 
33.5% in this study, which is much lower than that of other 
countries.13,14 Considering that only 2.4% (3/124) of anti-HCV￾positive and HCV RNA-negative persons had been treated for 
hepatitis C, anti-HCV positivity and HCV RNA negativity can 
be interpreted to imply spontaneous clearance of HCV infec￾tion, false positivity, or transient undetectable viremia which 
can be observed in acute infection but rarely occur in chronic 
infection.15 In the United States National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Study (NHANES), the false positivity rate among 
positive anti-HCV test results was 22% and indeterminate 
in 10% overall via a recombinant immunoblot and the false 
negativity rate was 63% in the setting of S/CO ratio ≤8.0.16 In 
this study, the anti-HCV S/CO ratio was 8.0 or below in 61% 
(156/246) and significantly higher in HCV RNA-positive persons 
(13.99±2.26 vs 3.43±3.44, p<0.001). The spontaneous clear￾ance rate of HCV infection was reported to be 36.1% in a recent 
metanalysis.17 Younger age, genotype 1 infection, hepatitis B 
virus (HBV) co-infection, and IL28B polymorphism were associ￾ated with spontaneous clearance of HCV infection.18 Endemic 
HBV infection,19 predominant genotype 1 HCV,6
 and the pre￾dominant C/C type of IL28B in Korea20 might result in a higher 
rate of spontaneous HCV infection clearance. The spontaneous 
clearance rate of acute hepatitis C in Korea was reported to be 
44.7%.21 The prevalence of HCV RNA-positivity increased with 
age, which may suggest a higher spontaneous clearance rate 
among younger persons. 
The awareness rate of HCV infection is estimated to be 20% 
worldwide1
 and varies among countries and regions accord￾ing to socioeconomic status and health policy.22 The awareness 
rate of HCV infection among anti-HCV-positive Koreans was 
reported to be 28% to 34%,23,24 which was much higher than 
the value of 15.2% obtained in this study. These differences in 
awareness among studies might result from the differences in 
study populations among the HCC epidemiology survey, can￾cer screening program, and the KNHNES. There has been no 
study on the awareness among HCV RNA-positive Koreans. 
The awareness rate of HCV infection among HCV RNA-positive 
persons was 30% in this study. It was not significantly differ￾ent according to age, sex, area of residence, family income, and 
ALT levels, whereas higher education level was associated with 
a higher awareness rate. The awareness rate of HCV infection 
in Korea (30%) is much lower than in the United States or some 
European countries.22,25,26 There are currently no screening pro￾grams for HCV infection in Korea. Therefore, efforts are needed 
to raise the awareness rate of HCV infection.
A study using the Korean national health insurance claims data 
estimated that 13.9% of patients with chronic HCV infection had 
been treated with interferon or peginterferon±ribavirin.27 This 
study showed that 13.5% of persons with chronic HCV infection 
had been treated. Because DAAs have been used in Korea since 
2015, treatment regimens for HCV infection in this study were 
based on interferon or peginterferon. The treatment rate might 
have increased further since the introduction of DAAs, and it is 
necessary to keep track of it. 
The limitation of this study is the relatively small number of HCV 
RNA-positive subjects, which hinders a more detailed analysis of the 
factors associated with hepatitis C viremia. In addition, we did not 
have any detailed information on HCV genotypes, treatment regi￾mens, or risk behaviors for HCV infection. However, the strength of 
this study was that it investigated the prevalence of HCV and HCV 
RNA positivity in representative samples of the Korean general 
population. Moreover, we believe that this is the first report on the 
awareness and treatment status of HCV RNA-positive Koreans. 
In conclusion, the anti-HCV prevalence among adult Koreans 
was 0.71% with no gender difference and increased with age. 
About one-third of anti-HCV-positive Koreans had positive serum 
HCV RNA test results. The awareness and treatment of HCV infec￾tion among HCV RNA-positive persons were as low as 30.5% and 
13.5%, respectively. Therefore, active measures aimed at raising the 
awareness and treatment rate among HCV-infected persons should 
be taken to move towards HCV elimination in the era of DAAs.
