Abstract
Background: Infection with carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii has been associated with high
morbidity and mortality in solid organ transplant recipients. The main objective of this study was to assess the
influence of carbapenem resistance and other potential risk factors on the outcome of A. baumannii infection after
kidney and liver transplantation.
Methods: Retrospective study of a case series of A. baumannii infection among liver and renal transplant recipients.
The primary outcome was death associated with A. baumannii infection. Multivariate logistic regression was used to
assess the influence of carbapenem resistance and other covariates on the outcome.
Results: Forty-nine cases of A. baumannii infection affecting 24 kidney and 25 liver transplant recipients were
studied. Eighteen cases (37%) were caused by carbapenem-resistant isolates. There were 17 (35%) deaths associated
with A. baumannii infection. In unadjusted analysis, liver transplantation (p = 0.003), acquisition in intensive care unit
(p = 0.001), extra-urinary site of infection (p < 0.001), mechanical ventilation (p = 0.001), use of central venous
catheter (p = 0.008) and presentation with septic shock (p = 0.02) were significantly related to a higher risk of
mortality associated with A. baumannii infection. The number of deaths associated with A. baumannii infection was
higher among patients infected with carbapenem-resistant isolates, but the difference was not significant (p = 0.28).
In multivariate analysis, the risk of A. baumannii-associated mortality was higher in patients with infection acquired
in the intensive care unit (odds ratio [OR] = 34.8, p = 0.01) and on mechanical ventilation (OR = 15.2, p = 0.04).
Appropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy was associated with significantly lower mortality (OR = 0.04, p = 0.03), but
carbapenem resistance had no impact on it (OR = 0.73, p = 0.70).
Conclusion: These findings suggest that A. baumannii-associated mortality among liver and kidney transplant
recipients is influenced by baseline clinical severity and by the early start of appropriate therapy, but not by
carbapenem resistance.

Background
Bacterial infections are among the most relevant causes
of morbidity and mortality after organ transplantation.
The high prevalence of multidrug-resistance among bac￾terial pathogens causing infections in solid organ trans￾plant recipients is an additional concern [1,2]. In a
recent report, infections with multidrug-resistant Gram￾negative bacteria were associated with higher mortality
among liver transplant recipients [3]. In this context, the
emergence of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter bau￾mannii (CRAB) as a significant pathogen in many trans￾plant centers around the world is a special dilemma due
to the limited therapeutic choices available to treat these
infections [1,4]. Nonetheless, there are few data on the
epidemiology of CRAB infection among solid organ
transplant recipients and on its impact on the survival of
these patients [5-9]. The objective of the present study
was to analyze the possible influence of carbapenem re￾sistance and other potential risk factors on mortality
among solid organ transplant recipients with A. bau￾mannii infection.
Methods
Study design
This was a retrospective study of a case-series of kidney
transplant (KT) and liver transplant (LT) patients with
infection by A. baumannii. A case-patient was defined
as a subject with A. baumannii infection according to
Centers of Disease Control and Prevention criteria [10].
The study was approved by the Institutional Committee
on Research Ethics of the Hospital Universitário Clem￾entino Fraga Filho/Medicine School of the Universidade
Federal do Rio de Janeiro.
The primary endpoint was death associated with A.
baumannii infection, and the secondary endpoint was
death by any cause within 30 days of infection onset.
Death was defined as associated with A. baumannii in￾fection if the patient had persistent manifestations of the
infection and no other possible cause of death was
detected.
Case finding and data collection
An electronic search was performed in the microbiology
database to identify potential case-patients from January
2002 to January 2009. Data on the following variables
were collected from patients’ medical records: sex; age;
use of antimicrobial drugs within the previous 3 months;
the use of hemodialysis, mechanical ventilation and of
central venous catheters at the time of A. baumannii in￾fection diagnosis; treatment for acute graft rejection with
methyl-prednisolone pulse therapy or anti-thymocyte
globulin within the previous three months; date of hos￾pital and intensive care unit (ICU) admission; site and
date of diagnosis of A. baumannii infection, and the use
of appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy. This was
defined as the start of an effective antimicrobial drug
within 48 hours after the diagnosis of infection. Anti￾microbial therapy with polymyxin B was presumed to be
effective for cases of CRAB infection although suscepti￾bility test for this antibiotic was not routinely performed.
The date of infection was defined as that when the first
clinical specimen with isolation of A. baumannii was
collected. Infection was defined as acquired in hospital
or in the ICU if occurred >48h after hospital or ICU ad￾mission, respectively. All patients were followed until
death or hospital discharge.
Bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility
testing were performed by the VITEK-1 system (BioMér￾ieux Vitek Inc, Hazelwood, USA). Susceptibility to imipenem,
gentamicin, amikacin, ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin￾tazobactam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, ciproflox￾acin, minocycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole
was determined by disk-diffusion according to CLSI
recommendations [11]. As of July 2006, isolates were
also tested for meropenem susceptibility. Isolates with
intermediate susceptibility to imipenem or meropenem
were also defined as carbapenem-resistant.
Transplant protocols
Perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis for kidney and
liver transplantation consisted of cefazolin for 24 hours
and ampicillin plus sulbactam for 48 hours, respectively.
Immediately after transplantation, KT patients remained
in the nephrology unit with a basic immunossupressive
protocol consisting of a triple drug regimen including
corticosteroids, a calcineurin inhibitor (usually tacroli￾mus) and mycophenolate mofetil or sirolimus. Dual drug
regimens consisting of corticosteroids and mycopheno￾late mofetil or tacrolimus were prescribed for recipients
of allografts from HLA-identical donors. Anti-thymocyte
globulin was used as induction therapy in KT patients
who underwent retransplantation.
After transplantation, LT patients were admitted to a
surgical ICU where they remained until weaned from
mechanical ventilation. Immunossupression for LT
patients with chronic hepatitis B or C infection consisted
of corticosteroids and a calcineurin inhibitor (tacrolimus
or cyclosporin). Azathioprine or mycophenolate was
additionally used for the immunossupression of patients
with other indications for LT.
For both LT and KT patients, trimethoprim/sulfameth￾oxazole (80mg/400mg per day) was prescribed for six
months to one year after transplantation to prevent
Pneumocystis jiroveci infection.
Statistical analysis
The Mann–Whitney test was used to compare the distri￾bution of numeric variables while the Chi-square and

Fisher’s exact tests were used to analyze categorical vari￾ables. Potential associations of the study variables with
the outcomes were explored by univariate and multivari￾ate analyses in logistic regression models. All covariates
that were associated with a p value <0.25 in the univari￾ate analysis were selected for the multivariate analysis.
Final adjusted models were obtained with a forward
stepwise regression approach. Due to its clinical rele￾vance, the variable “carbapenem resistance” was selected
for the multivariate analysis and retained in all models
analyzed in the stepwise regression process. Other vari￾ables were added one by one. The selection of the vari￾able to be included at each additional step was based on
their p value calculated with the log-likelihood ratio test.
Only variables associated with a p-value ≤0.10 were
included in the model. Variables with a p-value >0.10
were removed from the adjusted models. Collinearity be￾tween variables was checked. The goodness of fit of the
final adjusted models was assessed by the Hosmer￾Lemeshow test. Additionally, the Akaike’s information
criterion (AIC) was used to compare candidate multi￾variable models. The selected final adjusted model for
each studied outcome was that with the lowest AIC. To
analyze the discrimination of the adjusted models for
the prediction of each outcome we calculated the area
under the receiver-operating curve (ROC) that were
plotted using the predicted values and observed events.
All p values presented are bicaudate and a p < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses
were performed with SPSS for Windows 18.0 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, Illinois).
Results
During the study, 800 subjects underwent kidney (562
patients) or liver transplantation (238 patients). A. bau￾mannii infection was diagnosed in 49 patients (6.1%).
The cumulative incidence was significantly higher
among LT recipients (25 cases, 10.5%) than in KT recipi￾ents (24 cases, 4.3%, p < 0.001). The sites of infection
included 17 blood stream infections (4 related to central
venous catheter), 14 symptomatic urinary tract infec￾tions, 13 pneumonias (10 associated with mechanical
ventilation), 5 surgical site infections (one superficial
and 4 intra-abdominal). The median time from trans￾plantation to the diagnosis of A. baumannii infection
was not significantly different between LT (13 days,
interquartile range [IQR]: 6–45 days) and KT (13.5 days,
IQR: 7–137 days) recipients (p = 0.23). KT and LT sub￾jects affected by A. baumannii infection differed signifi￾cantly regarding several other aspects (Table 1). LT
recipients presented a higher frequency of infections
acquired in the ICU (p < 0.001), affecting a non-urinary
site (p < 0.001) and associated with septic shock (p = 0.04),
mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001) and central venous
catheter use (p < 0.001). In addition, LT patients tended to
be older (p=0.09) and to have a more frequent history of

previous carbapenem therapy (p = 0.08). On the other
hand, treatment for an acute rejection episode was more
frequent among KT recipients (p < 0.001). These patients
also had a significantly higher serum creatinine level (p =
0.009).
Eighteen infections (37%) were caused by CRAB. Sus￾ceptibility tests for meropenem were available in eight of
these cases. Resistance to both imipenem and merope￾nem was observed in all of them. The median time after
transplantation to the diagnosis of the infection was
longer for CRAB (20 days, IQR: 9–299 days) than for
carbapenem susceptible A. baumannii infections (9 days;
IQR: 5–27 days). The proportion of infections caused by
CRAB was higher among LT recipients, but the differ￾ence was not statistically significant (p = 0.10, Table 1).
Table 2 presents the distribution of other variables be￾tween cases of CRAB and carbapenem susceptible A.
baumannii infection. CRAB infections were significantly
associated with previous use of any antibiotic (p = 0.001)
and, specifically, carbapenem (p < 0.001). CRAB infec￾tions were also significantly more frequent in patients
with use of central venous catheter (p = 0.005) and in
subjects undergoing hemodialysis (p = 0.01).
A total of 19 (39%) patients died: 18 within 30 days,
and one on the 52nd day after the diagnosis of the infec￾tion. This was the case of a liver transplant recipient
who was reoperated on the first postoperative week be￾cause of a biliary fistula that was successfully repaired
with a choledochojejunostomy. On the 28th postoperative
day, she was reoperated due to an abdominal abscess
caused by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. On the 50th
postoperative day she was reoperated again to drain an￾other abdominal abscess. CRAB was isolated in the clin￾ical specimen collected during this surgery. Despite
prolonged treatment with polymyxin B combined with
meropenem, she underwent laparotomy in two other
occasions due to the persistence of the abdominal infec￾tion. CRAB was still isolated from the abscess secretion
collected during the last reoperation, which took place
one week before her death.
In 17 cases (35%), deaths were defined as associated
with A. baumannii infection, including the one occur￾ring 52 days after the infection. Most A. baumannii￾associated deaths (15 cases, 88%) occurred within 14
days of the diagnosis. The median time from the diagno￾sis of infection to death tended to be shorter among
patients who did not receive appropriate empiric
antimicrobial therapy (one day) than in other patients
(8 days, p = 0.07).
In unadjusted logistic regression analyses (Table 3),
liver transplantation (p = 0.003), acquisition in ICU
(p = 0.001), extra-urinary site of infection (p < 0.001),
mechanical ventilation (p = 0.001), use of central venous
catheter (p = 0.008) and presentation with septic shock
(p = 0.02) were significantly related to a higher risk
of mortality associated with A. baumannii infection.

The number of deaths associated with A. baumannii in￾fection was higher among patients infected with CRAB,
but the difference was not significant (p = 0.28). Unex￾pectedly, therapy for acute graft rejection was associated
with lower mortality (p = 0.03). This finding probably
reflects confounding, as acute rejection was diagnosed
more frequently among KT recipients who presented
with lower baseline clinical severity as compared with
LT recipients. Univariate regression analyses with overall
30-day mortality as the outcome yielded similar results
(Table 4).
In multivariate analyses (Table 5), ICU-acquired infec￾tion (p = 0.01) and mechanical ventilation at baseline
(p = 0.04) were significantly related to a higher risk of
death associated with A. baumannii infection. Oppos￾itely, appropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy was
associated with a significantly lower A. baumannii-asso￾ciated mortality (p = 0.03). Acquisition in the ICU was
the only factor significantly related to overall 30-day
mortality (p = 0.001). In both multivariate analyses, re￾sistance to carbapenem had no impact on mortality. The
exclusion of resistance to carbapenem from the multi￾variate analysis did not cause appreciable changes in the
results of the final adjusted model for each outcome
(data not shown). The discrimination of the final multi￾variate model to predict death associated with Acineto￾bacter baumannii infection, as estimated by the area
under the ROC curve, was 0.901 (95% confidence
interval [CI]: 0.781 to 0.968). The area under the ROC
curve calculated for the adjusted model for overall 30-
day mortality was 0.799 (95% CI: 0.667 to 0.931).
Discussion
The emergence of infections caused by CRAB and other
multi-drug resistant bacteria among transplant patients
poses a difficult therapeutic challenge. In CRAB infec￾tions, therapeutic options are frequently restricted to
drugs such as polymyxins and amikacin, which are asso￾ciated with a higher risk of toxicity. Tigecycline has a
better toxicity profile, however, its use as a monotherapy
for the treatment of severe infections caused by CRAB,
such as bacteremia and hospital-acquired pneumonia, is
considered clinically unreliable [1,12]. Such therapeutic
limitations justify the hypothesis that CRAB infection
might be associated with a poorer prognosis especially in
immunocompromised hosts.
Most studies that addressed the impact of A. bauman￾nii infection on mortality defined overall 14 or 30-day
mortality as their primary outcome. However, it has
been observed both in transplant recipients [8] and in
other critically ill patients [13] that CRAB infection may
have a prolonged course that may ultimately result in
death after several weeks of continued antimicrobial
therapy [8]. Thus, the analysis of overall 14-day mortal￾ity might underestimate the impact of CRAB on mortal￾ity. On the other hand, overall 30-day mortality is more

likely to be influenced by factors other than CRAB infec￾tion, like those related to the underlying clinical severity
of the affected patients. Therefore, death associated with
A. baumannii was defined as the primary outcome of
this study. As expected, most A. baumannii-associated
deaths occurred within 14 days. However, some patients
had more prolonged course of the disease, and in one of
these cases A. baumannii-associated death occurred 52
days after the diagnosis of infection.
There was no significant association between carbape￾nem resistance and mortality. It might be argued that
this study was underpowered to detect a moderate in￾crease in CRAB associated mortality. In fact, there was a
non-significant increase in mortality among patients
with CRAB infection in the univariate analyses. How￾ever, in the final multivariable model for death asso￾ciated with A. baumannii infection, the estimated odds
ratio for carbapenem resistance was lower than one.
This finding suggests that the lack of association be￾tween carbapenem resistance and mortality in this re￾port is unlikely to be related to inadequate statistical
power. Conflicting results have been reported regarding
the possible influence of carbapenem resistance on mor￾tality among critically ill patients [14-19]. The reasons
for this inconsistency are not clear, but it is probable
that it comes from methodological differences among
these studies, especially in the approach to minimize
confounding by baseline clinical severity and to assess
the effect of early appropriate therapy [19].
Acquisition of infection in the ICU and being on
mechanical ventilation at the time of infection diagnosis
were both strongly related to A. baumannii-associated
death. These factors are probably surrogate markers of
clinical severity and its association with mortality is in line
with the results of other studies that pointed out the
influence of factors related to baseline clinical severity on
the outcome of A. baumannii infections [13,14,17,20,21].
The beneficial impact of early start of effective therapy
on the outcome A. baumannii infection has been

suggested by the results of other studies [6,18-22]. In￾deed, Kwon at al. observed that carbapenem resistance
was related to mortality in patients with A. baumannii
bacteremia only if the use of effective therapy was not
taken into account in the analysis [19]. Accordingly, in
this series of abdominal organ transplant recipients, the
use of appropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy was
related to a significantly better outcome. Similar results
have been reported by Kim and cols. [6] in a small case
series of living-donor liver transplant recipients. How￾ever, that study also included subjects infected with Aci￾netobacter lwoffii, a species that has been associated
with low mortality in immunocompromised patients
[23]. It is plausible that the impact of delaying appropri￾ate antimicrobial therapy for these infections may be
higher in immunocompromised hosts than in immuno￾competent patients. However, this issue was not
addressed in the present study. Similarly to what has
been described elsewhere [6,18,19,21,22], the proportion
of patients who received inappropriate empirical anti￾biotic therapy was high in this series. Our findings
underscore the importance of finely adjusting the selec￾tion of empiric antimicrobial therapy to the local epi￾demiological conditions.
The epidemiology and outcome of A. baumannii in￾fection among KT recipients is largely unknown. We
found that the overall cumulative incidence of A. bau￾mannii infection was significantly lower in KT recipients
than in LT patients. The prevalence of carbapenem re￾sistance was not significantly different between isolates
from both groups of patients, but clinical severity at the
time of infection diagnosis was lower among KT patients
as indicated by significantly lower frequency of ICU￾acquired infection, use of central venous catheter, mech￾anical ventilation and extra-urinary site infection. As
expected, the diagnosis of acute graft rejection was more
frequent among KT recipients, but this factor was not
independently related to A. baumannii-associated mor￾tality in our analyses. The lower baseline clinical severity
was probably responsible for the better outcome of KT
patients that was observed only in the unadjusted statis￾tical analysis. Unfortunately, because of the relatively
small number of cases included in the study, we could
not address specific prognostic factors for KT and LT
recipients infected with CRAB.
The present study has some limitations. The sample
size was relatively small and, thus, it is possible that the
influence of some of the studied variables on mortality
was missed in the multivariable analyses. Due to a retro￾spective design, we were not able to categorize patients
according to any validated severity of illness score. Al￾though other surrogate markers were used, we cannot
rule out the possibility of residual confounding related
to differences in baseline clinical severity. Similarly, it is
not possible to preclude confounding by aspects related
to antimicrobial therapy that were not addressed in the
present study, such as the specific drug or combination
of drugs used, doses and the exact number of hours
elapsed between the clinical diagnosis of infection and
the start of antibiotic treatment. One additional limita￾tion of the study was the identification of Acinetobacter
isolates by Vitek-1 system. However, most of the isolates
would be classified as A. baumannii by the current,
more accurate methods, and most human infections are
caused by this species. Therefore, it is likely that this
limitation did not have a major impact in the final
results. Finally, because this is a single center study, the
external validity of findings is uncertain. Larger, multi￾center, prospective studies would help to provide a bet￾ter definition of the factors that influence the outcome
of A. baumannii infections in transplant recipients.
Conclusions
These results suggest that A. baumannii-associated mor￾tality among liver and kidney transplant recipients is
influenced by baseline clinical severity and by the early
start of appropriate therapy, but not by carbapenem
resistance.
