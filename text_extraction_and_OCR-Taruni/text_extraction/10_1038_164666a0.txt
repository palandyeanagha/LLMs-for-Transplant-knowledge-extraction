Our analysis shows that the red system represents
a 15 — JI transition. A more detailed paper on
the red bands will appear in Arkiv fér Fysik.

Revival of Spermatozoa after Vitrification
and Dehydration at Low Temperatures

THE effect on spermatozoa of vitrification at
temperatures of —79° C. and below has been studied
by several authors. Human spermatozoa appear to
be the most resistant ; a substantial proportion may
show good motility on thawing after even prolonged
vitrification. Revival is far better when semen is
frozen in bulk than when minimal amounts in cap-
illary tubes are used. No explanation of this result
is yet forthcoming, but it would appear that rapidity
of freezing is less important than the avoidance of
surface effects.

Positive results have also been obtained with frog
and fowl spermatozoa*-*, though in both these cases
partial dehydration by the addition of sugar solutions
was found to be necessary before any significant
number of spermatozoa could be revived on thawing.
Fowl spermatozoa thus treated showed some slight
fertilizing power, but no live chicks were produced‘.
In our experience, revival of fowl spermatozoa after
vitrification \is negligible when the technique of
addition of levulose is followed.

The object of the present communication is to
report the action of glycerol and related compounds,
to which our attention was directed by a chance
observation, in protecting spermatozoa against the
effects of low temperatures. Experiments with human
spermatozoa showed that diluents containing glycerol
much increased the proportion of spermatozoa that
could be revived after vitrification. With this
material, the optimal final concentration was about
5 per cent (equal parts of semen and 10 per cent
glycerol in Baker’s fluid) ; lower concentrations were
less effective, higher ones were immobilizing. Glycerol
diluents did little to prolong the survival of sperm-
atozoa thawed out after vitrification, which is usually
inferior to that in control specimens. Experiments
with propylene glycol and ethylene glycol gave similar
results.

Results of a different order were obtained with
rabbit spermatozoa. With this species no spermatozoa
revive after bulk vitrification of semen. Glycerol
diluents were found to be highly toxic, the maximum
tolerated concentration being about 5 per cent. With
this concentration there was some revival after
vitrification (restricted movement of a considerable
number of spermatozoa) but no effect, under the
conditions employed, such as could be obtained with
human spermatozoa.

Dramatic results were obtained with fowl sperm-
atozoa. If fowl semen is diluted with equal parts of
Ringer’s solution and vitrified at —79° C. for 20 min.,
and then rapidly thawed, no significant revival of
spermatozoa is observed. On the other hand, if the
dilution is carried out with Ringer’s solution contain-

ing 40 per cent glycerol, the spermatozoa resume full
motility on thawing. So far as retention of motility is
concerned, the specimen is indistinguishable from its
unvitrified control; it shows even the wave motion
characteristic of fowl semen. Decreasing the final
concentration of glycerol below 10 per cent decreases
the protection against vitrification. Increasing it
above 20 per cent results in progressive immobiliza-
tion of the spermatozoa, which cannot altogether
be reversed by further dilution with Ringer’s solu-
tion; but with these higher concentrations, no
additional loss of motility is caused by vitrification.
Specimens of spermatozoa have beer found to resume
motility completely after long periods (up to ten
weeks) of vitrification. Other experiments showed
that both propylene glycol and ethylene glycol were
more toxic than glycerol, and in relation to their
toxicity less protective against vitrification.

The fact that spermatozoa resumed full motility
after vitrification under the conditions described
above made it possible to investigate the effects of
freeze-drying. 1 c.c. of fowl semen was diluted with
1 c.c, of 20 per cent glycerol in Ringer’s solution, and
vitrified as a thin layer in a 100-c.c. distilling flask at
—79°C. The temperature was then allowed to rise
to —25° C. and the flask connected to a high-vacuum
distillation system of which the condenser unit con-
tained liquid air. After 3 hr., when the distillation
was stopped, the semen had the appearance of being
dry, and 1-7 c.c. of water was thawed from the con-
denser. While still cold, the dehydrated semen was
reconstituted with 1-8 ¢.c. of water and warmed to
40°C. On microscopical examination with a 4-mm.
objective, active spermatozoa were seen in each field.
Further experiments on these lines showed that
recovery was better when 30 per cent glycerol in
Ringer’s solution was used, that the whole of the
glycerol remained with the dehydrated semen, from
which about 90 per cent of the water was removed
by the distillation, and that spermatozoa could not
be revived if the preparation was left at room tem-
perature for 2 hr., presumably because of the toxic
effect of concentrated glycerol. In each of eight
consecutive experiments, motile spermatozoa were
observed in the reconstituted semen, the best re-
covery being about 50 per cent of motile spermatozoa.
No information is yet available as to the fertilizing
power of spermatozoa thus resuscitated.

These experiments suggest that a high proportion
of the water can be withdrawn from fowl semen at
low temperatures without killing all the spermatozoa.
To what extent this result depends on the retention
of glycerol or on the unequal distribution of residual
water is not yet clear. Certain obvious experiments
on the factors involved and with the spermatozoa
of other species are in progress.

We are most indebted to our colleague, Dr. D. F.
Elliot, for his vital assistance at several stages of this
research. Our thanks are also due to Prof. L. Harvey
for the hospitality of his laboratory in University
College, Exeter.
