Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a rare genetic disease that results from mutations in the alpha-1 
antitrypsin (AAT) gene. The mutant AAT protein aggregates and accumulates in the liver leading to AATD 
liver disease, which is only treatable by liver transplant. The PiZ transgenic mouse strain expresses a human 
AAT (hAAT) transgene that contains the AATD-associated Glu342Lys mutation. PiZ mice exhibit many AATD 
symptoms, including AAT protein aggregates, increased hepatocyte death, and liver fibrosis. In the present 
study, we systemically treated PiZ mice with an antisense oligonucleotide targeted against hAAT (AAT-ASO) 
and found reductions in circulating levels of AAT and both soluble and aggregated AAT protein in the liver. 
Furthermore, AAT-ASO administration in these animals stopped liver disease progression after short-term 
treatment, reversed liver disease after long-term treatment, and prevented liver disease in young animals. Addi￾tionally, antisense oligonucleotide treatment markedly decreased liver fibrosis in this mouse model. Admin￾istration of AAT-ASO in nonhuman primates led to an approximately 80% reduction in levels of circulating 
normal AAT, demonstrating potential for this approach in higher species. Antisense oligonucleotides thus 
represent a promising therapy for AATD liver disease.
Introduction
Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is a serum protease inhibitor mainly 
produced and secreted by hepatocytes. As a member of the serpin 
super family, AAT covalently binds to its protease target thereby 
eliminating protease activity. One of the main AAT targets is neu￾trophil elastase, which causes damage to lung connective tissue 
if its activity is uncontrolled (1). AAT deficiency (AATD) is a rare 
genetic disease caused by mutations in the AAT gene. There are 
two main phenotypes associated with this disease: (a) adult-onset 
emphysema due to loss of AAT activity and unchecked neutrophil 
elastase activity and (b) liver disease due to polymerization and 
retention of mutant AAT in liver (2–9). The AAT mutation that 
causes the most severe lung and liver disease is the Glu342Lys (Z) 
point mutation. This mutation results in a “loop-sheet” confor￾mation of the protein that favors protein aggregation and impairs 
secretion from the liver (10, 11). In homozygous individuals 
(referred to as individuals with PiZZ), the abnormal protein is 
largely retained inside hepatocytes and forms insoluble aggregates 
within the rough ER. These intracellular inclusions are believed 
to be hepatotoxic, and liver disease occurs with a bimodal onset 
in a subset of patients with PiZZ. In infancy/early childhood liver 
disease, the pathology often presents initially as neonatal jaundice 
and cholestasis, followed by progression to advanced fibrosis or 
cirrhosis in a subset of children. In adulthood, liver disease mani￾fests as slowly progressive fibrosis, with an average age of diagno￾sis in the fifth decade, which is associated with increased risk of 
cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (12, 13). Although 
replacement therapy is available for lung disease by supplying plas￾ma-derived AAT, the only treatment option for AATD liver disease 
is liver transplant. As a result, AATD liver disease is one of the most 
common causes of liver transplant in children (14).
Transgenic mouse models have been established to investigate 
AATD liver disease (15–18). PiZ mice harbor the human AAT (hAAT) 
genomic transgene with the Z mutation and exhibit hAAT Z protein 
expression patterns resembling those in humans (19). As observed 
in patients with AATD liver disease, significant Z protein aggrega￾tion and retention is observed in PiZ mouse liver that can be visu￾alized with periodic acid–Schiff staining after diastase treatment 
(PAS-D) (15, 20). These PAS-D–positive aggregates, also known 
as globules, accumulate in the ER and cause ER stress (21–24), 
resulting in increased hepatic apoptosis in PiZ mice compared 
with that in wild-type animals. The magnitude of apoptosis cor￾relates with Z protein aggregate content in the liver (25). This liver 
injury signal stimulates less damaged hepatocytes to proliferate to 
compensate for cell death, which in turn increases the incidence of 
HCC (26, 27). In addition, globule-induced liver injury also leads 
to fibrosis in these mice (28–30). Since PiZ hepatocytes are not 
as healthy as normal hepatocytes due to the presence of globules, 
they have reduced tolerance to other stress conditions, including 
fasting, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and surgical proce￾dures such as partial hepatectomy (31–33). Because endogenous 
protease inhibitor genes are intact in PiZ mice, these mice have no 
lung abnormalities (15). Overall, PiZ mice are a valuable tool for 
the identification and evaluation of novel therapies for the treat￾ment of AATD liver disease.
Because AATD liver disease is the result of toxic gain-of-function 
mutations, we hypothesized that reduction of levels of the mutant

AAT protein would slow or reverse intracellular protein aggrega￾tion in hepatocytes and alleviate hepatic disease symptoms. It was 
shown previously that a siRNA delivered using a recombinant 
adeno-associated virus vector reduced Z protein production in PiZ 
mice during a short treatment period (34). To this end, we have 
generated second-generation antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) 
inhibitors complementary to the hAAT gene. Here, we show that 
ASO targeted against hAAT (AAT-ASO) is a potent AAT inhibitor 
in hepatic cells, PiZ mice, and cynomolgus monkeys. AAT-ASO 
treatment in adult PiZ mice significantly reduced soluble and 
aggregated AAT protein accumulation in liver and reduced liver 
fibrosis. When administered to young PiZ mice, AAT-ASO treat￾ment protected mice from globule formation in the liver and sub￾sequent globule-induced liver injury.
Results
AAT-ASO treatment reduces AAT mRNA levels in human hepatocytes 
and hepatocytes isolated from PiZ mice. Antisense technology exploits 
a cellular RNase H mechanism to degrade the target mRNA in an 
mRNA-ASO duplex, which ensures specificity. Second-generation 
ASOs are potent and specific inhibitors of gene expression that 
are well tolerated in rodents, primates, and humans (35). Over 
1,500 second-generation, 2′-O-methoxyethyl ASOs (35), each 20 
bases in length and designed to target the hAAT gene, were synthe￾sized, and their ability to reduce levels of AAT mRNA was tested in 
HepG2 cells, a human HCC cell line. Numerous ASOs were found 
to be active in reducing AAT mRNA levels (data not shown); how￾ever, one particular ASO (AAT-ASO), complementary to a region 
in exon 5 within the 3′ untranslated region of the AAT gene, was 
found to be particularly potent (Figure 1A). AAT-ASO is 100% 
complementary to both the human and monkey (Rhesus) AAT
gene but contains 6 mismatches to the mouse AAT gene. AAT-ASO 
activity was also confirmed in primary hepatocytes isolated from 
PiZ transgenic mice (Figure 1B). Electroporation of AAT-ASO into 
these cells produced significant reductions in AAT mRNA levels in 
a dose-dependent manner (IC50 = 0.5 μM in HepG2 cells and 0.4 
μM in PiZ transgenic hepatocytes). Importantly, the mismatched 
control ASO did not affect the expression of the AAT gene.
AATD liver disease occurs almost exclusively in patients with 
mutations in both alleles, and the majority of the clinical cases of 
AATD liver disease are patients with PiZZ. Other mutations can 
also cause protein aggregation and lead to liver disease, such as 
Mmalton (Δ52Phe) (36). The 3′ untranslated region target sequence 
for AAT-ASO lies outside regions of known AAT mutations, and 
no known single nucleotide polymorphisms have been reported 
within the AAT-ASO binding site. Thus, AAT-ASO is predicted to 
be perfectly complementary to all known mutant forms of AAT.
AAT-ASO treatment results in a dose-dependent reduction of hAAT pro￾tein in PiZ mice. In order to evaluate the in vivo activity of AAT￾ASO, 6-week-old PiZ mice were treated with 6.25, 12.5, 25, or

50 mg/kg/wk AAT-ASO for 4 weeks by subcutaneous injection. 
Plasma levels of hAAT protein were determined at baseline, 2 weeks 
after treatment, and at the end of treatment. Hepatic hAAT mRNA 
levels were determined at study termination. A dose-dependent 
reduction of hAAT mRNA and plasma protein levels was observed 
following treatment with AAT-ASO (Figure 1, C and D). At the 
50 mg/kg/wk dose, 70%–80% reduction in both hAAT mRNA and 
plasma hAAT protein levels was observed. We have shown previ￾ously that mismatches in ASOs greatly reduce their activity (37, 38). 
Since AAT-ASO has 6 mismatches to mouse AAT, we did not expect 
any significant effect on mouse AAT. As expected, human-specific 
AAT-ASO treatment had no effect on mouse AAT liver mRNA lev￾els or plasma protein levels (Supplemental Figure 1, A and B; sup￾plemental material available online with this article; doi:10.1172/
JCI67968DS1). No dramatic effects were observed on hepatocyte￾specific genes, such as albumin or transthyretin, or plasma albu￾min levels (Supplemental Figure 1, C–E) after AAT-ASO treatment. 
Administration with a second ASO targeting hAAT resulted in sim￾ilar target reductions (Supplemental Figure 4A), while treatment 
with a control ASO caused no reduction in hAAT mRNA or protein 
levels (Supplemental Figure 2, A and B).
AAT-ASO treatment reduces liver protein aggregates in PiZ mice. To 
evaluate the effect of AAT-ASO on accumulation of AAT protein 
aggregates in PiZ mouse livers, 6-week-old mice were treated with 
PBS, 50 mg/kg/wk AAT-ASO, or control ASO for 8 weeks. hAAT
mRNA and plasma hAAT protein levels were significantly reduced 
in AAT-ASO–treated animals compared with those in PBS- or con￾trol ASO-treated animals (Figure 2A, P < 0.01 with both compar￾isons). Liver pathology was evaluated by PAS-D staining to visu￾alize Z protein aggregates and by immunohistochemistry (IHC)

using an antibody specific to hAAT to visualize both soluble and 
aggregated Z protein (34). After AAT-ASO treatment, there was 
a significant reduction in hAAT in the liver, as shown by IHC. 
PAS-D staining also demonstrated a dramatic decrease in the size 
and number of hAAT aggregates in the livers of ASO-treated mice 
(Figure 2B). Percentages of area stained positively for PAS-D were 
quantitated with Aperio software and is shown in Supplemen￾tal Figure 3. AAT-ASO treatment resulted in approximately 70% 
reduction in PAS-D–positive area compared with that of the PBS 
treatment group. Treatment with control ASO had no significant 
effect on PAS-D staining (P > 0.05).
To confirm the reduction of liver hAAT aggregates after AAT￾ASO treatment, PiZ mouse livers were homogenized, and the 
soluble and insoluble hAAT fractions were separated (39). The 
soluble fraction corresponds to nonaggregated mutant hAAT 
within hepatocytes, and the insoluble fraction represents 
mutant hAAT protein that has aggregated into insoluble glob￾ules within the ER. As measured by Western blot analysis, AAT￾ASO treatment resulted in over 90% reduction of soluble AAT 
and approximately 80% reduction of insoluble AAT in PiZ liv￾ers. Again, control ASO treatment did not affect either soluble 
or insoluble AAT levels (Figure 2, C–E). Some minor discrep￾ancy between PAS-D staining quantification (70% aggregates 
reduction) and steady-state levels of insoluble protein deter￾mined by Western blot (∼80% reduction in insoluble protein) 
was observed, which could be due to differences in sensitivity 
of these two measurements. Nonetheless, both measurements 
indicate that AAT-ASO treatment significantly reduced liver 
AAT aggregates (P < 0.01 compared with PBS treatment group 
or control ASO treatment group). A second hAAT ASO (AAT￾ASO2) treatment resulted in similar reductions of soluble and 
insoluble AAT protein in liver, as determined by histological 
staining and Western blot (Supplemental Figure 4).
Comparing the effects of AAT-ASO treatment to baseline values, 
it is clear that AAT-ASO treatment stopped further accumulation of 
globules but did not reduce the liver globule load relative to baseline 
levels during this 8-week treatment period (Figure 2B; Figure 2, C and 
E; and Supplemental Figure 3, P > 0.05 when AAT-ASO treatment 
group was compared to baseline). In order to address the question 
of whether AAT-ASO treatment can reverse liver globule accumu￾Figure 3

lation, 16-week-old PiZ mice were administered with PBS or AAT￾ASO for 20 weeks. At this disease stage, liver globule accumulation 
slows down dramatically, as shown by the fact that the levels of liver 
insoluble AAT were comparable between baseline and PBS treatment 
groups (Figure 3, A–C, and Supplemental Figure 5). However, AAT￾ASO treatment dramatically reduced both liver soluble AAT (∼90%) 
and insoluble AAT (∼40%) compared with those at baseline (Figure 3, 
A–C), indicating reversal of liver globule accumulation.
Mutant Z protein aggregate formation in PiZ livers is heteroge￾neous across the liver lobes, as reported previously (1, 32). Using 
an antibody generated against the phosphorothioate backbone of 
ASOs, we sought to characterize the uptake and distribution of ASOs 
in PiZ livers and saw that both globule-containing cells and glob￾ule-devoid cells took up ASOs with relatively uniform distribution 
(Figure 3D). As previously reported, ASO staining is prominent in 
hepatocytes and in nonparenchymal cells, including endothelial cells 
and Kupffer cells. ASO accumulates mainly in perinuclear vesicles 
in hepatocytes (40, 41). Interestingly, in situ hybridization analysis 
showed that AAT transcripts also display a heterogeneous expres￾sion pattern in PiZ livers, with higher expression in globule-contain￾ing areas than globule-devoid areas. AAT-ASO treatment markedly 
reduced levels of hAAT mRNA in all hepatocytes (Figure 3E).

AAT-ASO treatment prevents liver aggregate formation in young PiZ 
mice. At birth, livers of PiZ mice were free of AAT aggregates. As mice 
aged, Z protein accumulated and formed aggregates in the livers. By 
2 weeks of age, small PAS-D–positive aggregates could be detected 
(Figure 4E). We treated 2-week-old PiZ mice with PBS, AAT-ASO, or 
control ASO, before significant accumulation of AAT aggregates had 
occurred. As observed in adult mice, 8-week AAT-ASO treatment sig￾nificantly reduced liver mRNA levels of hAAT and plasma hAAT by 
70% to 80% (Figure 4, A and B, P < 0.01). Control ASO treatment did 
not affect either hAAT mRNA or hAAT protein levels throughout the 
treatment (P > 0.05 when compared to PBS treatment group), analo￾gous to that seen in adult mice (Figure 2A). Similar to most human 
patients with AAT deficiency, young PiZ animals showed only mild 
elevations in liver enzymes (such as alanine transaminase [ALT] and 
aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) compared with non-PiZ controls. 
While control ASO treatment did not affect ALT/AST levels, treat￾ment of these young PiZ animals with AAT-ASO significantly low￾ered ALT levels, and this reduction was maintained throughout the 
course of the study (Figure 4C, P < 0.01 compared with control ASO 
treatment group). A similar trend of reduction was also observed 
with AST levels after AAT-ASO treatment (Figure 4D). IHC analysis 
demonstrated that liver AAT protein expression was greatly reduced 
in the AAT-ASO treatment group compared with that in the PBS 
group or control ASO treatment group (Figure 4E). In addition, the 
PBS or control ASO treatment groups showed extensive PAS-D–pos￾itive globules in the livers at 10 weeks of age, whereas globules were 
nearly absent in the AAT-ASO treatment group (Figure 4E). Similar 
effects were observed in both male and female PiZ mice (represen￾tative IHC and PAS-D micrographs are shown in Figure 4E). Thus, 
treatment with AAT-ASO prevented AAT protein aggregate forma￾tion and liver injury in these young mice.
AAT-ASO treatment ameliorates liver injury and fibrosis in PiZZ mice. 
It has been demonstrated that AAT aggregates in the liver lead to 
chronic liver injury and eventually liver fibrosis (15, 29, 30). PiZZ 
mice contain 2 alleles of the human Z mutant transgene and 
express higher levels of Z protein than PiZ mice. These mice show 
an ALT/AST spike as well as tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease 
(TIMP1) upregulation when they are approximately 3 months old, 
and fibrosis is established around 4 months of age (Supplemental 
Figure 6). To evaluate the effect of AAT-ASO treatment on liver 
fibrosis, we treated 5‑week-old PiZZ mice for 11 weeks with PBS, 
AAT-ASO, or control ASO (50 mg/kg/wk) subcutaneously. Eleva￾tions in markers of liver toxicity, ALT and AST, were observed in 
PBS- and control ASO-treated PiZZ mice at around 3 months of 
age, likely due to globule-induced hepatocyte apoptosis. However, 
AAT-ASO treatment significantly prevented elevations in ALT/
AST enzymes throughout the treatment period (Figure 5, A and 
B, P < 0.05 when compared to control ASO treatment group). Fur￾thermore, Sirius red staining demonstrated dramatically less col￾lagen fiber deposition in the AAT-ASO–treated livers as compared 
with PBS- or control ASO-treated livers (representative images 
are shown in Figure 5C; images from each individual animal are 
shown in Supplemental Figure 7, A–C; quantitation is shown in 
Figure 5E). PiZZ liver hydroxyproline content was also signifi￾cantly reduced in AAT-ASO–treated mice (Figure 5F, P < 0.05 when 
compared to control ASO treatment group). The hydroxyproline 
levels in AAT-ASO–treated animals were comparable to those of 
wild-type C57BL/6 mice of similar age (data not shown). Stain￾ing for α-SMA, a marker of activated stellate cells, was similarly 
reduced in the AAT-ASO treatment group compared with that in 
the control ASO treatment group (Figure 5, D and G). Reduction 
of α-SMA was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Supplemental 
Figure 7D). To further demonstrate the antifibrotic potential of 
AAT-ASO in PiZZ mice, mRNA expression analysis was conducted 
on a set of fibrosis-related genes in controls and AAT-ASO–treated 
mice. Compared with that in control ASO-treated animals, AAT￾ASO treatment dramatically reduced the expression levels of fibro￾sis-related genes in the livers. These genes included Timp1, αSMA,

Col1a1 and Col3a1, and metalloproteinases Mmp2 and Mmp9 (Fig￾ure 5H). No significant differences were observed between PBS 
and control ASO treatment groups with these fibrosis end points 
(P > 0.05). These data strongly indicate that AAT-ASO treatment 
ameliorates globule-induced liver injury and the subsequent devel￾opment of liver fibrosis in PiZZ mice. Treatment with a second 
hAAT ASO (AAT-ASO2) resulted in similar reductions of ALT/AST 
and liver fibrosis in PiZZ mice (Supplemental Figure 8).
AAT-ASO administration decreases AAT production in cynomolgus 
monkeys. The AAT-ASO evaluated in PiZ mice is complementary 
to human and monkey AAT mRNA. In isolated cynomolgus 
hepatocytes, AAT-ASO reduced AAT gene expression at concentra￾tions similar to those observed in human cells (IC50 of 0.1 μM for 
cynomolgus hepatocytes, Figure 6A). To determine the potential 
for this AAT-ASO to reduce AAT levels in nonhuman primates, a 
12-week cynomolgus monkey study was conducted in which AAT￾ASO was administered subcutaneously at 25 mg/kg 3 times for 
the first week and twice a week for weeks 2 through 12. AAT-ASO 
treatment was well tolerated and resulted in an approximately 80% 
reduction of liver AAT mRNA levels at the end of the study (Figure 
6B). Plasma AAT levels in untreated animals were relatively sta￾ble throughout the course of the study. However, treatment with 
AAT-ASO produced a time-dependent reduction of plasma AAT 
levels starting as early as day 9 (approximately 16% reduction) after 
initiation of treatment and with maximal effects (approximately 
70% reduction) observed between days 44 and 86 (Figure 6C). 
These results demonstrate that AAT-ASO is a potent inhibitor of 
AAT expression in cynomolgus monkeys and suggests that it has 
the potential to reduce toxic levels of mutant AAT expression in 
patients with AATD liver disease.
Discussion
In this report, we demonstrate that an ASO targeting AAT mRNA 
significantly reduces AAT mRNA levels in cells and generates 
reproducible and robust reductions in liver AAT mRNA and pro￾tein levels in PiZ mice and normal cynomolgus monkeys. AATD 
is a rare genetic disease that remains underdiagnosed despite the 
existence of a number of diagnostic tools, including the measure￾ment of serum or plasma AAT protein levels, AAT protein pheno￾typing using isoelectric focusing gel, and AAT genotyping (5, 6, 
12, 42). The PiZ mutation is believed to have arisen from a single 
founder about 2,000 years ago in the Viking population (43). In 
the United States, about 2% of the population is heterozygous 
for the Z allele, and approximately 0.05% or 150,000 people 
are homozygous (PiZZ) (12). About 10% of children with PiZZ 
develop early-onset liver disease (44); over one-third of adult 
patients with PiZZ have cirrhosis at the time of death (45). How￾ever, most patients with PiZZ have fairly normal liver function 
tests and no or minimal symptoms of liver disease. In a recent 
study with 647 patients with PiZZ, mean AST and ALT levels were 
just above the upper limit of normal and within normal range, 
respectively (46). This suggests that genetic and/or environmen￾tal factors influence the onset and the severity of the liver dis￾ease. The nature of these factors is still largely unknown. It was 
reported that male gender and obesity predispose adult patients 
with PiZZ to advanced liver diseases (47). A delay in intracellular 
degradation of the mutant protein may also play an important 
role in liver disease development (24). Identification of these fac￾tors will help our understanding of this disease and define the 
patients who will likely require therapy.
In part due to limited understanding of the natural history of 
AATD liver disease and lack of reliable biomarkers to monitor liver 
disease progression before severe fibrosis, cirrhosis, or HCC occurs, 
there are no clinically approved treatments for AATD liver disease 
except liver transplantation. A number of potential intervention 
methods have been investigated in animal models. Z protein aggre￾gation results in ER stress, which activates the autophagy pathway 
to clear the aggregates (48, 49). Carbamazepine (CBZ) promotes 
autophagy-mediated protein degradation. In PiZ mice, CBZ treat￾ment reduced hepatic aggregate load and fibrosis (29). It will be 
interesting to see whether similar effects can be achieved in patients 
with PiZZ at acceptable doses. Treatment with patient-derived 
induced pluripotent stem cells combined with zinc finger–medi￾ated homologous recombination and in vitro differentiation (50), 
treatment with siRNA or microRNA to reduce Z protein production 
(34, 51), inhibition of Z protein aggregation by targeting β-sheet A 
(52), and use of chaperones (53) have all been tested in cell-based or 
animal models. However, the practical utility of these approaches in 
patients with a chronic disease like AAT-related liver disease needs to 
be established. In contrast, an ASO of similar chemical modification 
as that used in our studies has demonstrated long-term therapeutic 
utility for the treatment of familial hyperlipidemia (54, 55).
In adult PiZ mice with established AAT pathology, AAT-ASO was 
internalized by both globule-containing cells and globule-devoid 
cells, causing a robust reduction in the expression of the mutant 
AAT gene. The efficacy was maintained during 5 months of in vivo 
treatment. Significant reductions in both the soluble and aggre￾gated AAT protein levels in the livers of AAT-ASO–treated PiZ 
mice demonstrate the benefit of directly preventing mutant gene 
expression. AAT-ASO treatment stopped disease progression and 
reversed liver disease in PiZ mice. Importantly, chronic reduction 
of AAT aggregates diminished the development of hepatic fibrosis. 
When AAT-ASO treatment of PiZZ mice was initiated at 2 weeks 
of age, liver AAT aggregate formation and subsequent elevations 
of liver enzymes were prevented. These findings support the prop￾osition that AAT-ASO could be used in pediatric patients with 
PiZZ with deteriorating liver disease, in addition to adult patients 
with PiZZ. By eliminating the toxic protein in adult and pediatric 
patients with PiZZ, AAT-ASO treatment may prevent and reverse 
liver disease progression, avoiding the need for liver transplant.
In patients with PiZZ, serum AAT levels are approximately 10%–15% 
of normal subjects due to intracellular aggregation. In addition, the 
low level of mutant protein present in sera of patients with PiZZ has 
impaired binding to neutrophil elastase (56). Z protein aggregates 
exhibit proinflammatory and neutrophil chemoattractant activity 
and have been detected in the lungs of patients with PiZZ (57). It has 
been hypothesized that the presence of Z aggregates in the lungs of 
patients with PiZZ worsens lung disease by recruiting neutrophils 
(36). On the other hand, AAT-null patients develop emphysema but 
are free of liver diseases. In some cases, emphysema occurs with an 
earlier onset in AAT-null patients than in patients with PiZZ, which 
suggests that residual Z protein may protect lung function to some 
extent (58). The number of AAT-null patients is very small, so these 
data must be interpreted with caution. Treatment of patients with 
PiZZ with AAT-ASO should reduce Z protein production and 
improve liver disease. Whether this treatment increases risk of lung 
disease needs to be carefully evaluated in clinical settings. If AAT￾ASO treatment does negatively impact lung disease in patients with 
PiZZ, AAT replacement therapy is available and could be used in 
combination with AAT-ASO.

sequences are listed in Supplemental Table 1.
Protein expression analysis. Liver soluble and aggregated AAT was separated as 
described previously (39). Briefly, the tissue was homogenized in a prechilled 
Dounce homogenizer for 30 repetitions and then passed through a 28-gauge 
needle 10 times. The total protein concentration was determined, and a 
5-μg total liver protein sample was aliquoted and centrifuged at 10,000 g
for 30 minutes at 4°C. Supernatant was immediately removed, and the 
insoluble protein was denatured and solubilized. Both fractions were sepa￾rated on SDS-PAGE; equal amounts of total liver protein were loaded per 
soluble-insoluble pair in quantitative experiments. AAT protein was detected 
by a polyclonal antibody against hAAT purchased from DiaSorin Inc., and 
the secondary antibody was HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-goat antibody (Jack￾son ImmunoResearch). GAPDH was detected using a monoclonal antibody 
from Advanced Immunochemical Inc. Western blot was quantitated with 
ImageQuant. α-SMA Western blot was carried out with a monoclonal anti￾body purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Both GAPDH and α-SMA antibodies 
were detected with horse anti-mouse secondary antibody from Cell Signaling.
IHC analysis. Animal tissues were collected, fixed in 10% buffered forma￾lin, and paraffin embedded. Sections were stained with PAS-D for AAT 
aggregates; AAT IHC for hAAT; Sirius red for fibrosis; α-SMA for activated 
stellate cells; ASO IHC for ASO uptake; and RNA in situ hybridization 
using QuantiGene ViewRNA Assay (Affymetrix). The following antibodies 
were used for immunostaining: anti-hAAT (Dako), anti–α-SMA (Abcam), 
and anti-ASO (Isis Pharmaceuticals).
Hydroxyproline assay. Liver hydroxyproline content was determined as 
described previously (62). Briefly, approximately 100 mg liver tissue was homog￾enized in 1 ml 6 N HCL and hydrolyzed at 110°C for 18 hours. A 25-μl aliquot 
was dried at 60°C, and the sediment was then dissolved in 1.2 ml 50% isopro￾panol and incubated with 200 μl 0.56% chloramines T solution (Sigma-Aldrich) 
in acetate citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 10 minutes at room temperature. Finally, 
1 ml Ehrlich’s reagent was added, and the mixture was incubated at 50°C for 
90 minutes. After cooling, the absorbance at 558 nm was measured.
Statistics. As specified in each figure legend, 1-way ANOVA with Tukey’s 
comparisons, 2-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post-hoc tests, or 1-tailed 
Student’s t test (paired analysis) were used for statistical analyses in this 
study. P values less than 0.05 were considered significant.
AAT-ASO reduces both wild-type and mutant hAAT, since the 
target population is mainly homozygous patients with PiZZ. 
The association between heterozygosity of AAT mutant alleles 
and the risk of chronic liver disease is still controversial. If the 
need arises for the treatment of heterozygous patients (PiMZ) or 
compound heterozygous patients (e.g., PiSZ), a Z allele–specific 
ASO could be designed as demonstrated previously with mutant 
Huntingtin (59, 60).
In summary, AATD liver disease is an underdiagnosed, rare genetic 
disease with significant unmet medical need. Here, we demonstrated 
that ASO treatment reduces mutant protein aggregation in the liver 
and ameliorates liver fibrosis in adult PiZ mice. Moreover, we showed 
that treatment prevents mutant protein aggregation and liver injury 
in young mice. Our data indicate that this treatment might benefit 
both pediatric and adult AATD patients with liver disease.
Methods
Cell culture and transfection. Human HCC cell line HepG2 cells (ATCC) were 
cultured in MEM containing 1% l-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 
and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin in 5% CO2 at 37°C. Mouse pri￾mary hepatocytes were prepared using standard collagenase procedure 
as described previously (61). Cynomolgus primary hepatocytes were pur￾chased from Celsis In Vitro Technologies. Electroporation of ASOs was 
carried out with optimized conditions using the HT-200 BTX Electropo￾rator with the ElectroSquare Porator (ECM 830) voltage source in 96-well 
electroporation plates (BTX, Harvard Apparatus, 2 mm). Cells were har￾vested approximately 16 hours after electroporation.
ASOs. All oligonucleotides used in these studies were 20 nucleotides in 
length and chemically modified with phosphorothioate in the backbone 
and 2′-O-methoxyethyl on the wings, with a central deoxy gap (5-10-5 
gapmer). Oligonucleotides were synthesized using an Applied Biosystems 
380B automated DNA synthesizer (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sci￾ences, Applied Biosystems) and purified as previously described (35).
Animal experiments. PiZ mice were generated and described previously (15). 
The animals were housed in microisolator cages on a constant 12-hour￾light/dark cycle with controlled temperature and humidity and were given 
access to normal chow and water ad libitum. Animals were injected subcu￾taneously twice per week with AAT-ASO, control ASO, or vehicle PBS for 
periods of time indicated above.
The cynomolgus monkey study was performed at Korean Institute 
of Toxicology (Daejeong, Republic of Korea), and all procedures were 
approved by its local animal use committee. The animals were injected sub￾cutaneously at 25 mg/kg 3 times for the first week and twice per week for 
weeks 2 to 12. Animals were individually housed in a controlled environ￾ment with constant temperature (21°C) and a 12-hour-light/dark cycle. 
Food and water were available ad libitum, except during collection of blood 
samples, in which case animals were fasted overnight.
Plasma chemistry analysis. Blood samples were collected by tail nick in mice 
and venipuncture of cephalic, saphenous, or femoral veins in monkeys. Plasma 
AAT levels and chemistry values were measured on the AU480 Clinical Chem￾istry Analyzer (Beckman Coulter). Monkey AAT was determined with Beck￾man Coulter hAAT assay. Due to strong cross-reactivity of this human assay 
with mouse AAT, a custom assay with DiaSorin Alpha-1 Antitrypsin reagent 
set was established and validated on the clinical analyzer using immunotur￾bidity method. This DiaSorin antibody showed minimal reactivity to mouse 
AAT, so mouse average endogenous AAT values were determined in normal 
mice and subtracted from the total AAT in PiZ mice to obtain hAAT values.
Quantitative real-time PCR. Cultured cells were lysed and the total RNA was 
extracted with Qiagen RNeasy columns. Animal tissues were homogenized 
in Guanidine Isothiocyanate solution (Invitrogen) supplemented with 8%
