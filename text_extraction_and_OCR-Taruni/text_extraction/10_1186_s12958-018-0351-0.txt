Abstract
Background: Women with polycystic ovary syndrome are more likely to suffer from obesity, insulin resistance, and
chronic low-grade inflammation. In fact, the excessive activation of monocytes exacerbates oxidative stress and
inflammation. However, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol neutralizes the pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant
effects of monocytes. The aim of this study is to investigate whether monocyte counts to high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol ratio can predict the inflammatory condition in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome.
Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a total of 124 women (61 of them with polycystic ovary syndrome and 63
age-matched healthy volunteers) were included in the study population. Obese polycystic ovary syndrome patients
(n = 30) with a body mass index of ≥25 kg/m2 and lean polycystic ovary syndrome patients (n = 31) with a body
mass index of < 25 kg/m2 were compared to age-and body mass index-matched healthy subjects (30 obese and
33 non-obese).
Results: The monocyte counts to high density lipoprotein cholesterol values in women with polycystic ovary syndrome
were significantly higher than in control subjects (p = 0.0018). Moreover, a regression analysis revealed that body mass
index, the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and the high sensitivity C-reactive protein levels were
confounding factors that affected the monocyte counts to high density lipoprotein cholesterol values. Additionally, a
univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the increased monocyte counts to high density
lipoprotein cholesterol values were more sensitive than the other known risk factors (such as increased body mass index,
homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and high sensitive C-reactive protein levels) in the prediction of the
inflammation in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome.
Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that the monocyte count to high density lipoprotein cholesterol may be a
novel and useful predictor of the presence of polycystic ovary syndrome.

Background
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine
disorder that affects 6-20% of women of reproductive age
[1, 2]. The disorder is characterized by oligo/anovulation,
hormonal and/or clinical hyperandrogenism, and the
appearance of polycystic ovaries on ultrasound [1, 2].
Women with PCOS are more likely to suffer from obes￾ity, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, endothelial
dysfunction, hyperandrogenism, and chronic low-grade
inflammation than are women without the condition.
Chronic low-grade inflammation seems to have a stimula￾tory effect on the development and progression of endothe￾lial dysfunction and atherosclerosis [3], and long-term
complications include type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardio￾vascular disease [1, 2]. It is therefore important to under￾stand the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of
this syndrome.
The high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) has
been found to be a highly sensitive inflammatory bio￾marker that is commonly used in the detection of

subclinical inflammation in patients with PCOS [4]. The
hsCRP test is also used to detect future cardiovascular
disease risk [5]. Moreover, increased counts of leucocytes
or related subgroups have been found to be additional
independent markers as well as prognostic factors in the
development of inflammation and atherosclerosis [6, 7].
Regarding the initiation and progression of the ath￾erosclerotic process, several biochemical markers (to
include hsCRP and leukocyte counts) associated with
inflammatory conditions, oxidative stress, and endo￾thelial dysfunction have been shown to reflect the se￾verity and prognosis of cardiovascular disease risk.
Monocytes constitute roughly 3-8% of circulating leu￾kocytes and-in conjunction with other granular and
agranular cells such as eosinophils, basophils, neutro￾phils, and lymphocytes-are essential components of the
innate immune system. In tissues, circulating monocytes
and their differentiated forms, known as macrophages,
play central roles in the initiation and resolution of
inflammation; this is principally achieved via phagocyt￾osis, the release of inflammatory cytokines, the presence
of reactive oxygen species, and the activation of the
acquired immune system [8]. However, the accumulation
of monocytes exacerbates oxidative stress and inflam￾mation. Thus the excessive activation of monocytes
aggravates diseases such as atherosclerosis, arthritis,
and multiple sclerosis, primarily affecting platelets and
endothelial cells and leading to the activation of the
prothrombotic pathway [9].
In contrast, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL￾C) neutralizes the pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant
effects of monocytes by hindering the oxidation of low￾density lipoprotein (LDL) molecules and the migration
of macrophages as well as by promoting the efflux of
cholesterol from these cells [10]. In addition to outlining
the well-known anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant
actions of HDL-C particles, it has recently been claimed
that these molecules play a suppressive role in the con￾trol of monocyte activation and in the proliferation and
differentiation of the progenitor cells of monocytes [11].
Recognised as a recently-emerged inflammation-based
marker, the monocyte count to HDL-C ratio (MHR) has
been reported to be a new predictor and prognostic
indicator of mortality and morbidity in many diseases
[12, 13]. The MHR has also been found to be corre￾lated with hsCRP levels in diseases that are associated
with chronic inflammation, such as cardiovascular
disease [14], chronic kidney disease [12], abdominal
aortic aneurysm [15], intracerebral hemorrhage [16],
hypertension [17], and metabolic syndromes [18].
According to the Rotterdam criteria [1], the prevalence
of PCOS in Turkish women is approximately 20% [2].
Thus, a considerable number of Turkish women with
PCOS are at an increased risk of developing diabetes
and cardiovascular disease in the future. The early diag￾nosis and prevention of inflammatory conditions in the
PCOS population is essential to maintain the long-term
wellbeing of these women and will aid in the proper
utilization of public health resources. To the best of our
knowledge, no study has yet examined the association
between PCOS and the MHR. Therefore, we aimed to
investigate whether the MHR, a readily available in￾flammatory and oxidative stress marker, is associated
with PCOS.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Balikesir
University, School of Medicine, Department of Obstet￾rics and Gynecology and Department of Cardiology
between January 2017 and June 2017. The study was
approved by the Ethics Committee of Balikesir Univer￾sity, and study protocols of were in accordance with
the Helsinki Committee requirements. Informed con￾sent was obtained from all participants.
In total, 124 women (61 with PCOS and 63 age￾matched healthy volunteers) were included in the study
population. Obese PCOS patients (n = 30) with a body
mass index (BMI) of ≥25 kg/m2 and lean PCOS patients
(n = 31) with a BMI of < 25 kg/m2 were compared to
healthy age-and BMI-matched subjects (30 obese and 33
non-obese). All patients were aged between 18 and
40 years.
PCOS was diagnosed using the Rotterdam criteria [1].
According to these diagnostic criteria, the presence of
oligomenorrhea (wherein menstrual cycles occur more
than 35 days apart) or amenorrhea (wherein menstrual
cycles ocur at least six months apart) was defined as oli￾goovulation, and the presence of at least 12 follicles
measuring 2–9 mm in diameter and/or an ovarian
volume greater than 10 cm3 in per ovary indicated the
existence of polycystic ovaries; additionally, the presence
of hirsutism was evaluated using the Ferriman–Gallwey
scoring system [19]. Areas near the lip, chin, chest,
upper and lower abdomen, upper arm, forearm and thigh
were visually assessed and granded a score between zero
(the absence of terminal hair) and four (the presence of
male-pattern terminal hair). A score greater than or equal
to six was defined as hirsutism.
Patients who were diagnosed with other disorders
whose clinical features are similar to those of PCOS, to
include Cushing’s syndrome, congenital adrenal hyper￾plasia and androgen-secreting tumors, were excluded
from participation. Additionally, patients who took
medicines, such as oral contraceptives, antilipidemic
and/or antihypertensive medications, steroids, anti￾diabetic medications, anticoagulants, or antiplatelet
drugs were excluded from the study.

Each participant’s height (m) and weight (kg) were
measured while the patient was dressed only in under￾wear clothing. Waist circumference was measured as the
minimum distance between the iliac crest and the lateral
costal margin. The waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was calcu￾lated as the ratio of the waist measurement to that of
the hip. BMI was calculated as the patient’s mass in kilo￾grams divided by the square of the patient’s body height
in meters (kg/m2
). All participant data was recorded and
stored in a computer database.
All PCOS and control patients were pooled from uni￾versity’s gynecology clinic. Additionally, PCOS patients
were reevaluated to determine whether they truly met
the clinical, ultrasound scan (U/S), and biochemical cri￾teria for PCOS based on the Rotterdam criteria. Physical
and gynecological examinations, pelvic ultrasounds, and
peripheral venous blood samplings were performed dur￾ing Day 2 or 3 of a participant’s menstrual cycles or pro￾gestogen induced early follicular phase (Day 2 or 3) in
subjects with amenorrhea. All women were examined,
and pelvic ultrasound scans were performed using a 7.
0 MHz vaginal transducer (Voluson 730, GE Healthcare,
USA) by the same gynecologist.
During blood pressure measurements, the brachial
artery was occluded by a cuff placed around the patient’s
upper arm; the cuff was then inflated to above systolic
pressure. As the cuff gradually deflated, pulsatile blood
flow was reestablished and was accompanied by sounds
that were able to be detected by a stethoscope held over
the artery just below the cuff. The onset of the pulsatile
blood flow sound (Korotkoff I) was recorded as systolic
blood pressure and the disappearance of blood flow
sounds (Korotkoff V) was recorded as diastolic blood
pressure. All measurements were performed by health￾care professionals, who were blinded to the clinical diag￾noses of the patients.
Biochemical evaluation
After overnight fasting, blood samples were collected
from the antecubital vein of patients between the hours
of 9 and 10 AM. Serum was collected following centri￾fugation at 2500 g for 10 min, and stored in deep freeze
at − 80 °C to await biochemical and hormonal assess￾ment. To avoid possible assay variability, all patient
blood samples were analyzed together.
Complete blood counts were measured via Sysmex
XE-2100 (Sysmex Corp. Kobe, Japan) using either the fluor￾escence flow cytometry or electrical impedance method.
The serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH),
luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol (E2), thyroid￾stimulating hormone (TSH), and total testosterone
were determined using commercially avaliable enzyme￾linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (eBioscience,
Austria) on a diagnostic instrument (BioTek, ELx 800,
USA). 2nd International reference preparation was used
for FSH and LH measurements. The levels of glucose,
total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) choles￾terol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol
were measured using commercially available kits on a
chemistry AutoAnalyzer (Cobas Integra 800; Roche
Diagnostics GmbH; Mannheim, Germany). Serum high
sensitive C-reactive protein (hs CRP) was measured
with chemiluminescent immunoassay using an ADVIA
Centaur XP (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, NY, USA).
The levels of fasting insulin were determined using com￾mercial kits and an automatic hormone analyzer (Beckman
Coulter; Unicel DXI 600; Access Immunoassay System).
The homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance
(HOMA-IR) was defined as (insulin x glucose) / 22.5 as
previously described [6].
Statistical analysis
The MedCalc Statistical Software Program version 17.2
(MedCalc, Belgium) was used for statistical analysis. Nor￾mally distributed data are described as mean ± standard
deviation, otherwise, as median (minimum-maximum).
Whether the distributions of continuous variables were
normal or not was determined by Kolmogorov–Smirnov
test. Also, the Levene test or F test was used for the evalu￾ation of homogeneity of variances.
The student’s t test was used to compare normally
distributed measurements for independent samples and
the Mann–Whitney U test was applied for comparisons
of the median values. The Chi-square test was used to
compare categorical data. While the mean differences
among more than two independent groups were ana￾lyzed by one-way ANOVA, the Kruskal–Wallis test was
applied for comparisons of the median values. When the
p value from one-way ANOVA or Kruskal–Wallis test
statistics was statistically significant the Scheffé test or
Post-Hoc analysis nonparametric multiple comparison
test was used to determine which group differed from
which others. The possible confounding factors that
associated with MHR value were evaluated by using
logistic regression analysis. In order to determine of the
independent variables for presence of PCOS, the univari￾ate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were per￾formed. To evaluate model characteristics of fitness,
Hosmer–Lemeshow tests were used. A p-value of < 0.05
was considered statistically significant.
Results
A total of 124 women—61 with PCOS (30 obese, 31
non-obese) and 63 age- and BMI matched controls (30
obese, 33 non-obese)—were included in this study. The
mean age of participants was 23.9 ± 4.9 in the PCOS
group and 25.2 ± 5.1 in the control group; there was no
statistically significant difference (p = 0.1566) between
Usta et al. Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology (2018) 16:34 Page 3 of 8

the groups. The mean BMI of participants was 26.6 ± 6.1
in the PCOS group, and 24.8 ± 5.3 in the control group
(p = 0.0858).
As compared to the control subjects, PCOS patients
had significantly higher WHRs, Ferriman Gallwey scores,
diastolic blood pressure levels, insuline levels, HOMA￾IR readings, hsCRP scores, total leucocytes counts, neu￾trophil counts, monocyte counts, total cholesterol levels,
LDL levels, total testosterone levels, LH levels and
MHRs (p < 0.05). However, HDL-C levels were lower in
PCOS patients than in control subjects (p < 0.0001). The
clinical, hormonal, and biochemical characteristics of the
groups are summarized in Table 1.
The biochemical parameters of obese and lean patients
with or without PCOS are shown in Table 2. Obese
PCOS patients had higher levels of diastolic blood pres￾sure, HOMA-IR, hsCRP, monocytes, total cholesterol,
and LDL-C but lower levels of HDL-C than did control
participants (p < 0.05). Lean PCOS patients had higher
levels of HOMA-IR, hsCRP, neutrophils, monocytes, and
total testosterone but lower levels of HDL-C and lym￾phocytes than did control participants (p < 0.05).
Interestingly, we found that obese PCOS patients
had higher levels of systolic blood pressure, diastolic
blood pressure, HOMA-IR, hsCRP, and total leuco￾cytes but lower HDL-C levels than did lean PCOS
patients (p < 0.05).
Importantly, we found that MHR values were signifi￾cantly higher in patients with PCOS than in control sub￾jects (p = 0.0018). Moreover, subgroup analysis showed
that MHR values of obese PCOS patients were signifi￾cantly higher than those of lean PCOS patients. Also,
MHR values of obese control patients were significantly
higher than lean control subjects.
A univariate regression analysis showed that BMI,
diastolic blood pressure, HOMA-IR, and hsCRP, were
possible confounding factors affecting MHR values
(Table 3). Furthermore, in order to identify independent
variables that might predict the presence of PCOS,
univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses
were performed (Table 4). During the univariate logistic
regression analysis, HOMA-IR (odds ratio [OR]: 1.3133
[95% CI: 1.0543–1.6358]; p = 0.0067), hsCRP (OR:1.2996
[95% CI: 1.0804–1.5634]; p = 0.0023) and the MHR (OR:

Discussion
In the present study, we evaluated multiple clinical and bio￾chemical variables in PCOS patients and compared them
with those of age- and BMI-matched non-PCOS subjects.
Our clinical and biochemical parameters confirmed that
women with PCOS, had higher scores in terms of WHR,
hirsutism, diastolic blood pressure, insulin, HOMA-IR,
hsCRP, total cholesterol, LDL-C, total testosterone, and LH
but also lower HDL-C values. Additionally, a subgroup ana￾lysis revealed that obese PCOS patients had higher levels of
diastolic blood pressure, insulin, HOMA-IR, hsCRP, and
monocytes, while members of the lean PCOS group had
higher levels of diastolic blood pressure, insulin, HOMA￾IR, hsCRP, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and total
testosterone as compared to age- and BMI-matched con￾trols; notably, these findings were consistent with those of
many previous studies [3, 20–24]. Importantly, we found
that the MHR was significantly higher in women with
PCOS than in women in the control group. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the asso￾ciation between the MHR and PCOS.
PCOS is a complex endocrine and metabolic disease
that is associated with obesity, insulin resistance, compen￾satory hyperinsulinemia, and chronic low-grade inflamma￾tion [3]. Previous studies have shown that various
biomarker alterations are associated with insulin resist￾ance and low-grade inflammation in patients with PCOS
[21, 22]. Therefore, PCOS is linked to a combination
of risk factors that may lead to the development of
cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Indeed, low-grade inflammation, impaired glucose tol￾erance, central obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension
in PCOS patients are associated with an increase in
cardiovascular disease risk [20].
The activation of monocytes and their differentiated
forms into lipid-laden macrophages plays a significant
role in the promotion of immune defenses in patients
with chronic inflammatory conditions; these actions also
drive inflammation and cardiovascular disease. Johnsen
et al. demonstrated that an elevated monocyte count can
be used as an independent predictor of future plaque de￾velopment in previously plaque-free arteries [25]. More￾over, the activation of monocytes and their differentiated
forms into macrophages can be modulated by inflamma￾tory cytokines [26]. However, HDL-C molecules have
the ability to counteract macrophage migration and
eliminate cholesterol from these cells. Classically known
as an antiatherogenic lipoprotein, HDL-C promotes
reverse cholesterol transport from the arterial wall￾specifically from lipid-laden macrophages [27]. It has
been suggested that HDL-C may play a protective role
in atherogenesis via the regulation of endothelial adhe￾sion molecule expression, thereby preventing the gener￾ation of oxidatively modified LDL-C and the stimulation
of endothelial nitric oxide synthases [27]. Additionally,
HDL-C has anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti￾thrombotic effects [10, 27]. The anti-inflammatory effect
of HDL-C results from its interaction with both circulat￾ing cells, which have the ability to inhibit both leukocyte
and platelet activations. HDL-C is highly effective in
inhibiting the endothelial expression of adhesion mole￾cules and in preventing monocyte recruitment to the
artery wall [28]. As briefly mentioned above, higher
monocyte counts and lower HDL-C levels seem to be
indirect indicators of inflammation and of the develop￾ment of atherosclerosis [26]. Indeed, the relationship
between these two parameters provides a better under￾standing of concomitant inflammation.
Relevant literature contains a limited number of studies
on the MHR and its role in predicting inflammation. A
recent study conducted by Cetin et al. found that the MHR
was a novel inflammation-based marker that could be used
as an independent predictor of both the severity of coron￾ary artery disease and the likelihood of future cardiovascu￾lar events in patients with acute coronary syndrome [14].
Similarly, increases in the MHR have been associated with
more severe cardiovascular prognoses in patients with
chronic kidney disease [12]. Additionally, the MHR was an
independent variable for cardiovascular events within this
population [28]. Cockerill et al. indicated that the MHR
may be a predictor of stent thrombosis and mortality in ST
elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients [29].
Moreover, a recent study conducted by Vahit et al. demon￾strated that an increased MHR score may be a useful indi￾cator of metabolic syndromes [18]. Consistent with these

studies, we found that the average MHR value of patients
with PCOS was substantially higher than that of patients
without PCOS. Moreover, the univariate regression analysis
showed that BMI, diastolic blood pressure, HOMA-IR, and
CRP, were possible confounding factors affecting MHR
values in our study population. Also, in an effort to identify
independent variables for the prediction of PCOS, univari￾ate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were con￾ducted; these analyses showed that the MHR was the only
independent variable for women with PCOS. These results
indicated that higher MHR values may be associated with
ongoing inflammation in the pathophysiology of PCOS. In
their entirely, these findings signaled the importance of the
MHR with regard to systemic inflammatory conditions and
endothelial dysfunction, both of which play crucial roles in
the development of future cardiovascular disease.
Insulin resistance is a cornerstone of PCOS. Insulin
resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia in PCOS
patients seem to have a stimulatory effect on chronic
low-grade inflammation. It is known that obesity is asso￾ciated with insulin resistance and low-grade inflamma￾tion in the PCOS population [24]. Fat tissues, such as
those found in endocrine organs, engage in metabolic
and endocrinological activities whereby cytokines and
other messenger proteins called adipokines are produced
and secreted. Cytokines mediate many physiological and
pathological metabolic processes, such as satiety and
energy balance, inflammation, insulin resistance/sensitiv￾ity, angiogenesis, lipid metabolism, and atherosclerosis.
Many previous studies have shown that early atherogen￾esis and subclinical atherosclerosis are more common in
patients with PCOS than in control subjects [30]. In line
with the existing literature, we found that obese PCOS
patients had higher HOMA-IR, hsCRP, and total leuco￾cyte counts but lower HDL-C levels than did lean PCOS
patients [3, 20–24]. Moreover, the MHR values of obese
PCOS patients were significantly higher than those of
lean PCOS patients. Additionally, the HOMA-IR and
total leucocyte counts were significantly higher in obese
control patients than lean control patients. As expected,
the MHR values in obese control patients were higher
than in lean control patients in our study population.
These results clearly indicated that obese PCOS patients
tend to be at a higher risk for the development of future
cardiovascular disease than are other patients.
Limitations
The main limitations of this study concerns its cross￾sectional study design and its relatively small population
size. Moreover, monocyte and lymphocyte counts were
calculated automatically using peripheric blood samples.
The absence of other inflammation and oxidation parame￾ters, in conjunction with the lack of a comparison to other
inflammation biomarkers, was another limitation of this
study. Data regarding patients’ alcohol intake and smoking
habits to include frequency of use and years of smoking
history, both of which may affect the development of
PCOS, were not included in our study due to the absence
of records.
Conclusions
This study was the first to investigate the significance of
the MHR in patients with PCOS. Our study demon￾strated that patients with PCOS have higher MHR values
than do women without the condition. The MHR may
be used as a simple, low-cost, reproducible biochemical
marker to be used in the detection of cardiovascular dis￾ease risk in PCOS patients; notably, it is also beneficial
in the diagnosis of PCOS using other diagnostic criteria.
The present study suggests that further prospective ran￾domized studies be conducted in order to fully evaluate
the association between the MHR and PCOS.
