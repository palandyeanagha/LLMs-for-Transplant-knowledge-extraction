Diverticular Disease of the Colon: A Deficiency Disease
of Western Civilization
NEIL S. PAINTER, DENIS P. BURKITT
British Medical journal, 1971, 2, 450-454
We present a hypothesis as to the cause of diverticulosis coli
which is consistent with its geographical distribution, its recent
emergence as a medical problem, and its changing incidence.
Diverticulosis appears to be a deficiency disease caused by the
refining of carbohydrates which entails the removal of vegetable
fibre from the diet. Consequently we consider it to be prevent￾able.
Diverticulitis first became a clinical problem at the turn of
the century, and the term "diverticulosis" first appeared in 1914.
As recently as 1916 the disease was not important enough to
merit a mention in textbooks.'
Though the present incidence of diverticulosis is unknown it
is certainly endemic in our aged citizens. This dramatic increase
in incidence occurred in only 70 years and cannot possibly be
explained on a genetic basis. This change might be due to
observer error and be apparent rather than real, but we believe
that their writings show that the clinicians of the last century
were just as capable as those of today of recognizing diverti￾culitis. We believe that there is another possibility-namely,
that the colon's environment has changed and that diverticula
are caused by the diet of so-called "civilized" countries.
Historical Impact of Diverticular Disease on Medicine
DIVERTICULA AS A CURIOSITY
The term "divertikel" was used by Fleischman in 1815.2
Gross in 1845,3 Cruveilhier in 1849,4 Rokitansky in 1849,5
Haberschon in 1857,6 and Klebs in 18697 realized that diverti￾cula were acquired and thought they were caused by consti￾pation. The danger of diverticula as sites of infection and
perforation was pointed out by Cruveithier;4 in 1859 Sidney
Jones described vesicocolic fistula due to diverticulitis.8 Harrison
Cripps in 1888 collected 63 enterovesical fistulae but believed
that they were caused by ingested foreign bodies.' He empha￾sized that they were usually the result of "inflammatory
mischief" and not of cancer, but he blamed only diverticulitis
in the case of Jones.
Virchow in 1853 described perisigmoiditis,l" while Loomis in
1870 recorded peritonitis resulting from diverticulitis."1 Since
this complication was still regarded as a surgical curiosity 30

Staff
years later it is unlikely that perforated diverticulitis was
common at that time.
Our nineteenth-century predecessors described diverticula
and their complications accurately, but they regarded them as
curiosities. Their concept of the pathogenesis of diverticula was
surprisingly correct, and not until a century later, when cine￾radiography and pressure recording became available, were
diverticula shown to be the result of functional obstruction due
to segmentation dividing the colon into "little bladders."
These become "trabeculated," with the colonic muscles thrown
into ridges of varying thickness before the herniation of the
mucosa takes place.12 -17
Modern workers have only confirmed what Gross3 believed￾namely, that diverticula were caused by obstruction "by which
the muscular fibres are separated from each other so as to
permit the mucous membranes to protrude,. . . " Haberschon'
blamed constipation for muscle thickening and for diverticula.
Lane in 1885 realized that diverticula were not caused by
distension, but that they were produced similarly to bladder
diverticula-namely, by muscular contraction." Bristowe in
1854 believed that diverticula were caused in a manner which
resembled that operating in the secculated bladder and that
costiveness might mimic the effects of obstruction."'
Surely, these men who, over a century ago, could foretell the
findings of recent research would have recognized diverticulitis had
it been common in their day.
EMERGENCE OF DIVERTICULITIS AS A CLINICAL PROBLEM
Graser in 1899 emphasized that diverticulitis led to perisig￾moiditis and perforation,20 and this warning was proved true
within a decade. Five years later Beer described 18 infected
diverticula and stressed that they could cause peritonitis,
adhesions, fistula, and stenosis, but he still believed that they
seldom caused symptoms.2' "Diagnoses" such as pericolitis
sinistra, perisigmoiditis, torsion and inflammation of ap￾pendices epiploicae lingered on, being still considered res￾pectable by Bland-Sutton,22 d'Arcy Power,22 Donaldson,21 and
Lloyd Roberts.25 Even in 1910 Gordon Taylor and Lakin26
were reluctant to attribute peritonitis to diverticulitis, while
Moynihan27 28 and Mayo et al.2' considered that diverticulitis
mimicking cancer was still newsworthy at this time.
Dr. Telling, of Leeds, first saw the disease in 1899 when no
one was familiar with it, but by 1908 he could describe all its
complications, and in 1917 he published his classic description
of diverticular disease. Even so, the condition was still not
mentioned in textbooks in 1920.1 30 31
Diverticulitis surprised even surgeons of repute early in the
century, but by 1920 Sir John Bland-Sutton remarked that "in
the last ten years, acute diverticulitis is recognised with the
same certainty as appendicitis and is a newly discovered bane
of elders."32

BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL 22 MAY 1971
DIVERTICULOSIS AS A PROBLEM OF INCREASING MAGNITUDE
The advent of contrast radiology33 37 showed diverticulosis to be
common and prompted attempts to discover its true incidence.
Necropsies showed that diverticula were rare before the age of
40. Necropsy and barium enema estimates of the prevalence of
diverticula are given in Tables I and II. Neither method gives
the true incidence. Necropsy series include more older subjects,
and barium enemas are usually undertaken for symptoms.
Radiological series exaggerate the incidence, while necropsy
findings vary with the pathologists' interest in diverticulosis.
The true incidence of diverticulosis could be found only by
subjecting a sample of the population to annual barium enemas,
but this is not practicable.
Bearing these limitations in mind, Mayo in 1930 was probably
very near to the truth when he estimated that 5% of colons in
patients over 40 bore diverticula,'38 as this figure agrees with
contemporary necropsy series in the United States and Britain.
Barium enemas were used more sparingly in those days but
gave a similar incidence of 6-10%, which appears not to have
increased greatly in the next 10 years. Morton, reviewing
American necropsies,39 and Edwards, quoting English barium
enema studies,40 recorded similar figures.
Recent studies from the U.S.A., U.K., Australia, and France
indicate that the incidence of diverticulosis has risen drama￾tically. Between one-third and one-half of those over 40 have
diverticula, and the incidence rises to two-thirds at 80 years.4'4'
The disease must have become commoner in Australia, as it
was much less frequent there in the 1940s.4
Diverticular disease was almost unknown in 1900, but has
451
become the commonest affliction of the colon in Western countries
within 70 years, the traditional life span of man.
Geographical Distribution of Diverticular Disease
This dramatic rise in the incidence of diverticulosis has occurred
only in economically developed countries, whose diet has
changed only recently in the time scale of human nutrition.
There are few diseases whose incidence varies so much through￾out the world as that of diverticulosis-namely, from nil to
nearly 30% of the population. A close relation exists between
this incidence and economic development. The incidence in
each developing country varies with the state of their economic
development and corresponds to that which pertained in
Western countries at a similar time in their industrial develop￾ment when their pattern of life was similar. Obviously due
allowance has to be made for the fact that diverticular disease
takes about 40 years to develop, even after the colon's environ￾ment has been changed. Therefore diverticular disease would
not be expected to be seen in a community until it had departed
from its traditional eating habits for half a life-time. Consequent￾ly even where the incidence may one day be great the disease
cannot be expected to be common until this unfavourable
environment has operated for many years. Thus the condition
would be expected to be almost unknown in sub-Saharan Africa
to this day, and this is indeed the case. Epidemiological evidence
indicates precisely this relationship.
The greatest contrast is to be seen between the Western
world, including North American Negroes, and rural Africa

DIVERTICULAR DISEASE IN AFRICA
Africa was least affected by the economic changes that occurred
elsewhere just over a century ago, and our studies emphasize
the almost total absence of diverticular disease in the rural
Africans. During 20 years of practising surgery in Africa,
mostly in a teaching hospital, one of us (D.P.B.) encountered
not a single case of diverticulitis, nor did his surgical colleagues
see the condition.
In the 2,000-bed Baragwanath Hospital, Johannesburg,
serving the most urbanized Africans, Keeley45 found no diverti￾cula in 2,367 necropsies from 1954 to 1956, and Solomon46 saw
none in 600 barium enema examinations. The disease is extre￾mely rare in the Bantu.47
At Mulago Hospital, Kampala, Davies found only two diverti￾cula in 4,000 necropsies in 15 years.48 Hutt49 saw none in eight
years in his pathological department, while Templeton50
found only three caecal diverticula in 300 colons carefully
scrutinized at necropsy. In Nairobi Miller5' saw diverticulitis
once in the past 11 years, and Chapman52 saw one case in
Durban in 14 years. Jain53 served nine years in the Congo and
Badoe54 16 years in Ghana, but both saw diverticulitis only
once. Admittedly, diverticulosis might be missed where facilities
are limited, but it is inconceivable that diverticulitis would be
unrecognized consistently at major African hospitals with
first-class staff and equipment and extensive necropsy ex￾perience. As the disease is so rare, even in African teaching
hospitals, it is not surprising that 37 questionnaires completed
recently by doctors serving in rural African hospitals showed
that they had seen only two cases of diverticular disease between
them, though some of them had had over 20 years' experience
in Africa.
DIVERTICULAR DISEASE IN OTHER DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
The disease is almost as rare in Asians as it is in rural Africa.
Tinckler saw 10 cases in the one and a half million Chinese,
Indian, and Malay inhabitants of Singapore in five years, but
three in only 15,000 Europeans.55 Kutty,56 in three years at
Kuala Lumpur, found no diverticula at necropsy and de Beaux
saw only a single case among 137,000 native Fijians as against
two in the 7,500 resident Europeans.55 Saidi,57 Anderson,58
and Wright,59 did not see the disease in Shiraz (Iran), India,
and New Guinea respectively. Kim found no diverticula in
500 necropsies in Korea.60
We know that these countries have fewer elderly people than
do the industrial countries, but this could not affect the issue
sufficiently to account for the almost complete absence of the
disease in developing countries.
This survey confirms that diverticular disease is rarely found in
peoples whose eating habits have changed but little up to the
present.
In theory the amount of fibre in a diet may be reduced not
only by the refining of flour and cereals but also by the sub￾stituting of refined sugar for unrefined foodstuffs that were
previously eaten. In practice these processes occur together, as
both follow industrialization.
In Britain the diet changed radically around the year 1880,
though stone-ground white flour had been freely available
since 1800.61 A daily diet of 21 oz (600 g) of stone-ground wheat
mixed with rye together with oatmeal porridge was not un￾common as late as 1860. Much of the fibre had been removed by
stone grinding, but in 1880 the introduction of roller milling
removed two-thirds of the remaining fibre from the flour.
Concurrently, increasing prosperity, improvements in rail and
sea transport, and refrigeration made other foods cheap and
BRII ISH AMEL'ICAL JOURNAL 221 AAY 1911
available. Meat imports doublcd, and refined sugar and jam
(which is 6000 sugar) became part of the diet of the poorest
classes.62 The consumption of refined sugar almost doubled
between 1865 and 1890,63 and this was accompanied by a fall in
the consumption of bread; this trend has continued to the
present except during the two world wars.
If this swing from a high-residue diet to a low-residue diet is
responsible for diverticulosis then the disease would be ex￾pected to be prevalent about 40 years after 1880, and, in fact,
diverticulosis was common in Britain by 1920.
Likewise, increased prosperity led to a fall in the consumption
of maize by the American Negro in this century. Formerly he
was less prone to diverticulosis than his white compatriots,"4
but this difference has almost disappeared.63 The raised inci￾dence of diverticulosis in Japanese who have migrated to
Hawaii compared with those who stayed in Japan has accom￾panied similar dietary changes.65
We believe that around 1880 the British diet was depleted of
fibre sufficiently to damage the colon. The evidence suggests
that the refining of flour and other cereals is the primary cause
of diverticulosis, while the consumption of refined sugar at the
expense of bread further increased the loss of dietary fibre.
Close observation of the dietary changes that are taking place
in sub-Saharan Africa, where the low-residue diet has not been
eaten for long enough to cause diverticulosis, is necessary. It has
been postulated that appendicitis is caused by eating refined
carbohydrates,63 66 67 and if this and our hypothesis are correct
then appendicitis, which is now becoming increasingly common
in educated Africans, will be followed by the appearance of
diverticulosis after a time interval similar to that which separated
their recognition in Britain.
Postulated Relation
If a low-residue diet causes diverticulosis this must be related to
colonic segmentation, which is the mechanism responsible for
mucosal herniation. The role of segmentation in colonic
physiology and in the genesis of diverticula is summarized in
Fig. 1.14-16 68

FIG. 1-Role of segmentation in colonic physiology and the pathogenesis of
diverticula. Segmentation is concerned in the transportation and halting of
faeces in the sigmoid colon. Diagram A shows a segmented colon; one seg￾ment has produced pressure by contracting. Diagram B shows how re￾laxation of the contraction ring on one side of this se-ment allows its contents
to move into the next segment which harbours a lower pressure; this is the
mechanism by which contents are moved. Diagram C shows how faeces are
halted; contraction rings act as baffles which slow and finally halt contents,
and a pressure change results. Segmentation is seen in the sigmoid as
faeces are shunted back and forth. Diagram D shows a segmented colon
acting as a series of "little bladders" whose outflow is obstructed at both
ends and which extrude diverticula by generating high localized intra￾segmental pressures. Segmentation is essential to the pathogenesis of
diverticula. Any factor that causes segmentation to occur more frequently or
more efficiently favours the causation of diverticular disease. (Reproduced
by kind permission from Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England.)
We suggest that an unrefined diet containing adequate fibre
may prevent diverticulosis for the following reasons:
(1) The colon that cones with a large volume of faeces is of a
wide diameter and does not develop diverticula.fi 70 Such a colon,
having a wide bore ab initio, segments less efficiently than does a
narrow colon and is less prone to diverticulosis.'6

(2) In most instances thc food residuc passcs through the Afri￾can's gut within 48 hours,-' whcrcas in an Englishman this may
takc morc than twice as long.27: Thus the African's colon absorbs
w%ater for less time and has to propel a less viscous faccal strcam.
Hence the African's colon probably produces less pressurc, and
is lcss apt to become "trabeculated" and to bear diverticula.
(3) In Western countrics custom often demands the suppression
of the call to stool; this favours drying of the facces and increased
pressure generation. On the other hand the South African Bantu
passes large moist motions without straining.7'
In short, the swiftly passed soft stool subjects the sigmoid to
less strain and docs not favour the decvelopment of divcrticula.
Effects of High-residue Diet on Established Disease
If a lack of fibre causes diverticulosis then the symptoms of
diverticular disease might be alleviated by replacing the fibre,
in the form of bran, in the diet. This has proved to be the case
in a trial of 70 patients with the disease. Bran has relieved or
abolished abdominal aching and pain and distension in over
80", of patients. Even severe colic which first was diagnosed as
left renal colic disappeared on a high-residue diet. It is not yet
known whether this diet prevents diverticulitis, but the symp￾toms of painful diverticular disease are usually diminished or
abolished by adding bran to the diet. 4
Origin of Low-residue Diet
Previous regimens of treatment were founded on a misunder￾standing of the causc of diverticulosis. Spriggs and Marxer in
1927 believed that constipation and facces stagnating in the
sigmoid led to infection, so thcy gave paraffin to cleanse the
colon.75 Undigested fragments of food and bone associated with
diverticulitis were reported by Cripps,9 Bland-Sutton,`` and
Brewer,76 and were believed to cause perforation. Hence a
low-residue diet was advocated by authorities such as Slesinger,7'
Oschner and Bargen,78 Willard and Bockus,79 Brown and
Marcley,"' and Edwards."
For nearly 50 years the low-residue diet has been the main￾stay of mcdical treatment despite the lack of any evidence that it
is of benefit. We believe that this diet is contraindicated in
patients who suffer from diverticular disease because it is the
cause of the condition.
Diseases Associated with Diverticulosis
The epidemiology of colon diverticula is closely linked with
other non-infcctive diseases of the bowel. Communities free
from the condition are equally exempt from benign polyps of the
colon and have a very low incidence of colonic cancer and
ulcerative colitis.8- The association of gall-bladder disease,
hiatus hernia, and diverticulosis is sometimes called "Saint's
triad", but diverticula arc also commonly associated with
cardiovascular disease, duodcnal ulcer and appendicitis,83 81 and
with diabetus mellitus.85
All these diseases are rare in people who have adhercd to their
traditional diet, and Cleave et al.63 used the term "saccharine
disease" (pronounced like the River Rhine) to include these
diseases which they believe are caused by an excessive con￾sumption of refined carbohydrate. If this is true these diseases
should become commoner in the developing countries as they
change to a Western diet.
Conclusion
Historical and epidemiological studies provide abundant evi￾dence that diverticulosis coli is a disease of economically
developed nations who eat a diet in which the carbohydrate is
refined. Feeding rats with high-residue and low-residue diets,
and a clinical trial in which a high-residue diet was given to
patients with the disease, also indicate a cause-and-effect
rclationship between a low-residue diet and diverticular
disease.
The- disease and its complications are an increasing problem
in Western countries, and we believe that much greater attention
should be paid to preventive measures. It is worth remembering
that the rise in the death rate from diverticular disease was
halted in Britain only during the war and immediate postwar
years, when white bread was not available and refined sugar
was strictly rationed (Fig. 2). Perhaps a return to this high￾residue diet would achieve more than all our surgical endeavours.

Once these causative factors have been recognized it is the
duty of the profession to point the way to prevention, even if it
entails issuing a warning with regard to such popular food￾stuffs as white flour, both brown and white sugar, confectionery,
and foods or drinks which contain unnaturally concentrated
carbohydrates. Diverticular disease is a deficiency disease and,
like scurvy, it should be avoidable. By retracing our dietary
steps it should be possible to prevent its appearance in future
generations and perhaps to lessen the incidence of carcinoma of
the colon which has a similar epidemiology.

General Practice Observed
Expressions of Morbidity in General Practice
D. C. MORRELL
British Medical Journal, 1971, 2, 454-458
Morbidity studies in general practice measure the impact of
disease on the primary physician and may or may not reflect the
prevalence of disease in the community. A variety of studies
have been conducted in the past two decades focusing on
different aspects of this problem. Logan and Cushion' studied
the whole spectrum of morbidity in general practice; Fry2
concentrated on the natural history of specific diseases; Shep￾herd et al.3 focused on psychiatric morbidity. These and other
workers have related consultation rates and observed prevalence
rates to a variety of characteristics such as the age, sex, and

social class of patients at risk. Fry, by studying patients over a
period of time, has been able to relate his findings to indices
such as fatality rates and other measures of disability and to the
use of resources.
To obtain a deeper understanding of the impact of illness on
the general practitioner this study was designed to supplement
the usual measurements of consultation rates and observed
prevalence rates with measurements of the time devoted to the
management of different diseases, the disability they produce,
the diagnostic activity they provoke, and the extent to which
the management of illness may be delegated to paramedical
workers.
