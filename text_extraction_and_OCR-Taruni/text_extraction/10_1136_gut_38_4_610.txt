Abstract
Background/Aims-The course of
primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is
highly variable and unpredictable. This
study describes the natural history and
outcome of PSC. These data were used to
construct a prognostic model for patients
with PSC.
Methods-A total of 305 Swedish patients
with PSC were studied. The median
follow up time was 63 (1-194) months and
all patients could be traced for follow up.
Some 79 patients died or had a liver trans￾plant. The prognostic significance of
clinical, biochemical, and histological
findings at the time of diagnosis were
evaluated using multivariate analysis.
Results-The estimated median survival
from time of diagnosis to death or liver
transplantation was 12 years. Cholangio￾carcinoma was found in 24 (8%) of the
patients and 134 (44%) ofthe patients were
asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis.
The estimated survival rate was signifi￾cantly higher in the asymptomatic group
(p<0.001). However, 29 (22%) of the
asymptomatic patients became sympto￾matic during the study period. It was
found that age, serum bilirubin concen￾tration, and histological stage at the time
of diagnosis were independent predictors
of a bad prognosis. These variables were
used to construct a prognostic model.
Conclusions-This prognostic model
developed from a large homogeneous
population of PSC patients should be of
value for the timing oftransplantation and
patient counselling in PSC.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a
chronic biliary destructive disease of unknown
aetiology. The natural history is highly vari￾able, some patients being asymptomatic for
years, others rapidly progressing to premature
death resulting from liver failure or cholangio￾carcinoma.' 2 There is no effective treatment.
With optimal timing for liver transplantation,
however, excellent results have been
achieved.3-6 It is therefore of importance to
develop prognostic models that can be used
to classify patients for therapeutic trials, for
timing of liver transplantation, as well as in the
counselling of patients. The results of studies
from large referral centres are conflicting
because of differences in sample size, referral
patterns, definition of start and end point of
the disease but may also be because of ethnic
differences.7-'0
PSC is a heterogeneous disease and there￾fore it is important to describe the natural his￾tory and factors of prognostic importance in a
homogeneous population.
The aim of this retrospective study was
threefold: (a) to describe the natural history
and outcome for 305 PSC patients of Swedish
descent; (b) to evaluate the prognostic signifi￾cance of clinical, biochemical, and histological
findings at the time of diagnosis using multi￾variate analysis; and (c) to construct a prog￾nostic model.
Methods
Patients
Three hundred and five patients of Swedish
descent with PSC were included in the study.
The patients were treated by doctors who are
members of the Swedish Internal Medicine
Liver Club (SILK) at nine hospitals through￾out Sweden. The hospitals all serve both as
primary and referral hospitals. Liver transplan￾tation in Sweden is only performed at
Huddinge and Sahlgrenska hospitals, both
centres participating in the study. All patients
that have been personally treated by the
respective investigators were included in the
study. The data were collected and verified
using a questionnaire agreed upon in all
centres by the investigators.
Diagnosis
The diagnosis of PSC was based on typical
cholangiographic findings in all patients in
combination with clinical, histological, and
laboratory data." 12 The cholangiographic
techniques used were either endoscopic retro￾grade (n= 266), percutaneous transhepatic
(n=9) or operative (n=30). The confluence of
the bile ducts at the hilum was used to distin￾guish between the extra and intrahepatic
biliary system.
Clinical, histological, and biochemical variables
Symptoms and signs including jaundice, right
upper quadrant pain, pruritus, fever, ascites,
and variceal haemorrhage were recorded at the

time of diagnosis and at follow up. Patients
were classified according to the presence of
symptoms at diagnosis as asymptomatic or
symptomatic. Histological staging was based
on previously established criteria.13 For the
regression analysis, all biopsy specimens were
restaged according to the Mayo Clinic model
using value 1 for stage I and II, 2 for stage III,
and 4 for stage IV.8 The diagnosis of cholan￾giocarcinoma was based on histological exami￾nation.
Biochemical analyses including total bili￾rubin, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, aspar￾tate and alanine aminotransferases were
performed using standardised techniques at
the local hospital. Evidence for inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD) was investigated by sig￾moidoscopy, colonoscopy or barium enema in
all patients. A diagnosis of ulcerative colitis
(UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) was based on
accepted criteria.'4 15
Statistical methods
The starting point of the disease was defined as
the time of typical findings at cholangiography.
The time of onset of persistently abnormal
liver function tests was also recorded. End
point was either death from liver disease or
liver transplantation. The patients were
studied until the end of 1992. The x2 test or
Student's t test for continuous variables were
used to compare differences between sympto￾matic and asymptomatic patients, referred and
non-referred patients, and patients with and
without cholangiocarcinoma. Kaplan-Meier
analysis was used to calculate actuarial sur￾vival. The prognostic significance of different
variables present at the time of diagnosis was
analysed using the Cox proportional hazard
model. A prognostic model was constructed
with factors found to be of independent prog￾nostic value.
Results
General characteristics
Among the 305 patients, 195 were males
(64%) and 110 females; 146 (48%) patients
came from the primary catchment area of each
hospital, whereas 159 patients had been
referred from hospitals in other areas of the
country. The median age at the time of diag￾nosis was 39 (range 5-80) years. The median
delay from the first presentation ofbiochemical
signs or symptoms compatible with PSC until
the time of diagnosis was 52 (range 0-451)
months. Most, 203 (67%), of the patients had
both intra and extrahepatic PSC, whereas 83

(27%) had intrahepatic involvement only, and
19 (6%) had only extrahepatic PSC. In 249
(81%) patients, PSC was associated with IBD:
220 (72%) had UC, 20 (7%) had CD, and
nine (2%) had unspecific colitis. Among the
patients with CD, 12 had involvement of the
colon only and in eight patients the disease was
found in both the small bowel and the colon.
Seventy four patients (30%) with IBD had pre￾viously undergone proctocolectomy. Patients
without IBD were significantly older at the
time of PSC diagnosis than the patients with
IBD (44.8 v 38.5 years, p<0002). Sex,
number of patients with intra/extrahepatic dis￾tribution of disease, observation time, time to
diagnosis, and development of cholangiocarci￾noma did not differ between patients with and
without an associated IBD.
Symptoms
At the time of diagnosis, 171 (56%) patients
had one or more of the symptoms listed in
Table 1. The most common symptom was
pain localised to the right upper quadrant,
described by 112 (37%) patients. During a
median observation period of 69 months, 29
(22%) of the asymptomatic became sympto￾matic.
Laboratory and histologicalfindings at time of
diagnosis
The bilirubin concentration was normal in 179
(59%) patients at the time of diagnosis and the
mean figure for the whole group was 39
,umolll. Alkaline phosphatase activity was
normal in 26 (8.5%) patients and the average
for the group was 18 ,ukat/l (Table II). Liver
biopsy was carried out in 254 patients at the
time of diagnosis and stage I or II was present
in 118 (46%), stage III in 73 (28%), and liver
cirrhosis (stage IV) in 67 (26%).
Asymptomatic and symptomatic patients
Table II shows data from patients with and
without symptoms at the time of diagnosis.
Significantly more women than men were
found in the symptomatic group and patients
with symptoms were older than asymptomatic
ones at the time of diagnosis. The prevalence
of an associated IBD differed significantly
between the two groups and almost all asymp￾tomatic patients had an IBD, probably
reflecting the fact that most IBD patients in
Sweden are regularly screened with liver func￾tion tests. Furthermore, PSC has actively
been looked for in UC.16 There was no differ￾ence between the groups in time from first
presentation of abnormal liver function tests
until the diagnosis of PSC was established
with a cholangiogram. The observation time
for the asymptomatic group was slightly
longer than for the symptomatic group.
Symptomatic patients had significantly higher
serum values of bilirubin, aspartate amino￾transferase and alkaline phosphatase, and
lower values of albumin than those without
symptoms.

Referred and non-referred patients at the time of
PSC diagnosis
Clinical and epidemiological data concerning
age, sex, follow up time, presence of IBD, and
symptoms did not differ between referred and
non-referred patients.
PSC and cholangiocarcinoma
There was no significant difference between the
patients who developed cholangiocarcinoma
and those who did not with respect to sex, age at
presentation, extra or intrahepatic involvement
ofthe biliary disease, or associated IBD. Nine of
24 patients who developed cholangiocarcinoma
did so within one year after the PSC diagnosis.
As the presenting features of these nine patients
could have been caused by the cholangiocarci￾noma, these patients were excluded from the
comparisons regarding symptoms and bio￾chemical tests. The only symptom that occurred
significantly more often at time of diagnosis in
the cholangiocarcinoma group than in the
tumour free group was abdominal pain (59% v
35%) (p<001). Serum bilirubin at diagnosis
was higher in the patients who later developed
cholangiocarcinoma (82-9 v 35.1 gmol/l)
(p<0 005).
Follow up
At follow up in 1992, information was avail￾able for all 305 patients. The median follow up

time to death, transplantation, or closing of the
study was 63 (1-211) months. At follow up,
226 (74%) patients were alive and had not had
a transplant 66 (range 1-211) months after
diagnosis, 45 (14%) had died after 51 (range
1-154) months, and 34 (11%) had had liver
transplantation 62 (range 1-137) months after
diagnosis. Twenty nine (64%) of all deaths
were caused by liver failure. Furthermore, four
patients died in massive variceal haemorrhage.
Cholangiocarcinoma was the main cause of
death in 12 patients; when the patients who
had had a transplant were included cholangio￾carcinoma was diagnosed in 24 (8%) patients,
32.5 (1-154) months after the diagnosis of
PSC. There were no differences in time from
the first findings consistent with PSC until the
diagnosis was confirmed with a cholangiogram
between patients developing and not develop￾ing cholangiocarcinoma. Thus, among the 79
patients who died or underwent liver trans￾plantation, cholangiocarcinoma was diagnosed
in 24 (30%). In the whole group of patients
with a follow up >five years 16% developed
cholangiocarcinoma. Only 69% of all patients
who died had a necropsy, but all livers
removed at liver transplantation were, how￾ever, carefully examined for cholangiocarci￾noma. Among the 65 patients who died and
had a necropsy or had a liver transplant 19
(29%) had cholangiocarcinoma.
Survival analysis
The estimated median survival time for the
whole PSC group was 144 months. Kaplan￾Meier survival curves showed a significantly
better median survival for the asymptomatic
patients than for those who were symptomatic
at the time of diagnosis (112 months)
(p<0.001) (Fig 1).
Univariate and multivariate analysis
The prognostic value of 19 variables present
at the time of diagnosis were studied using
univariate analysis (Table III). Variables
found to be of prognostic significance by uni￾variate analysis were entered into a multivari￾ate analysis. Symptoms were also tested in
combination with each other. Using backward
elimination as well as forward selection, four
variables available at diagnosis of PSC were
found to be of independent prognostic value:

Discussion
This study describes the natural history of 305
PSC patients from Sweden, a country with
approximately eight million inhabitants. In
comparison 174 PSC patients from the United
States and 126 from England, countries with
considerably greater numbers of people have
been presented.8 9 The prevalence of PSC in
Swedish patients with UC has previously been
described.'6 If the prevalence of UC is around
150/100 000 inhabitants and approximately
50/o of all UC patients have PSC, this study
comprising 305 PSC patients represents
approximately 40-50°/O of all PSC patients in
Sweden.
Our material differs from that of the
American and English studies in its high per￾centage of patients from the primary catch￾ment area, probably giving a more
representative reflection of the natural history
of PSC.
The general characteristics of the patients in
this study resemble those found in Norway,
England, and the United States with a male
predominance, a mean onset of disease around
40 years of age with a very large span (5-80
years) with respect to the age at diagnosis, and
a close association with IBD.8 9 17 It can be
argued that the inclusion of unspecified colitis
(nine patients, 2%) into the IBD group is
unjustified, but during the observation time
some of the patients with unspecified colitis
were reclassified as suffering from UC or CD.
Thus, the prevalence of IBD is 8 1 % in this
study whereas results of studies from the
United States show (71%),8 England (71%),9
and Norway (100%).17 The Norwegian study
is the only one in which all patients underwent
colonoscopy and patients with unspecified
colitis were included.
Twenty seven per cent of the patients in this
study had intrahepatic PSC only. This is in
agreement with a study from Yale,7 but in con￾trast with studies from both the Mayo Clinic8
and King's College Hospital9 showing a con￾siderably lower percentage of patients with
intrahepatic PSC only. Although real differ￾ences may exist between the various PSC pop￾ulations, there may also be differences in
anatomical definition of the extra and intra￾hepatic ductal system.
The important differences between the PSC
populations in the various studies seem, how￾ever, not to be found in the general character￾istics of the patients but rather in the severity of
the disease. In four studies describing the
natural history of PSC the number of asympto￾matic patients ranged from 1 5-25%,7-10
whereas a figure of 44% was noted in our
study. Differences concerning definition of
symptoms do exist between the previous
studies. Fatigue was defined as a symptom in

some studies7 9 but not in this one because of
problems in defining this subjective symptom
retrospectively. In the study by Farrant et al,9
fatigue was the most common symptom,
reported by 65% of the patients.
This study comprises the largest number of
asymptomatic PSC patients described; this
may in part be explained by the high rate of
patients with PSC restricted to the intrahepatic
biliary tree, as 60% of these patients were
asymptomatic. Significant differences between
asymptomatic and symptomatic patients were
found in survival, biochemical, and histological
parameters, but also with respect to age at pre￾sentation and sex. Survival rate for the asymp￾tomatic groups was 700/0 at 16 years after
diagnosis (Fig 1). This benign course for the
asymptomatic group is in agreement with the
study by Heltzberg.7 However, 22% of all
asymptomatic patients developed symptoms
during a median observation time of 69
months, and approximately 13% of the asymp￾tomatic patients died or had liver transplants.
This emphasises the progressive nature of PSC
even in the asymptomatic group.
Despite the pronounced differences in sur￾vival between symptomatic and asymptomatic
patients, the only symptom that was found to
be of independent prognostic significance
using multivariate analysis was variceal
haemorrhage, which occurred in only 4%/o of all
patients.
Differences in both definition of start and
end point of the disease may influence actuar￾ial survival time in different studies. In the
study from King's College Hospital, reporting
an estimated median survival time of 12 years,
the start point of disease was defined as the
onset of abnormal liver function test or signs
compatible with PSC.9 In our study an average
of 52.5 months elapsed from onset of abnor￾mal liver biochemistry until the diagnosis was
confirmed with a cholangiogram. The median
survival time would probably therefore be
longer if we had used King's definition of start
point. As 81% of our patients had an associ￾ated IBD and activity of the colitis, and as
treatment with drugs for the bowel disease and
parenteral nutrition can cause abnormal liver
function tests, we defined the start point of
disease as the time of cholangiographic diag￾nosis.18 The Mayo Clinic study reporting an
estimated median survival time of 11.9 years,
defined start point as date of referral to the
Clinic.8 10 As 59% of all patients were jaun￾diced at time of referral to the Mayo Clinic
compared with 30°/0 in this study, the disease
process was probably more advanced at inclu￾sion in the Mayo study.
End points in the various prognostic studies
comprise both date for liver related deaths and
liver transplantation or include only liver
related deaths. The addition of liver transplan￾tation as an end point in this study was chosen
because over 30%/ of Swedish PSC patients
submitted for liver transplantation died while
waiting for a liver transplant.19
The reliability of a description of the natural
history of a disease depends upon the size of a
patient cohort in relation to the size of the
background population. The importance of
sample size may well be illustrated in the multi￾centre study presented by Dickson et al.'0 The
prognostic significance of different variables
was calculated for 426 PSC patients. For most
of these patients, prognostic factors had been
calculated in smaller separate studies. The
factors found to be of prognostic importance in
the large multicentre study differed from those
identified in the smaller studies. The multi￾centre study showed that serum bilirubin con￾centration, histological stage at liver biopsy,
age and, the presence of splenomegaly were
independent predictors of high risk of dying. In
our study with a large number of patients, bili￾rubin concentration, histological stage, and age
were all factors found to be of prognostic sig￾nificance.
The presence of splenomegaly was not eval￾uated in this study. The most accurate way to
determine enlargement of the spleen is with
isotopic scan, computed tomography or ultra￾sound. Although, one of these investigations
had usually been done in our patients, the
investigation had usually not been done at the
same time as the time of diagnosis or the size of
the spleen had not been described.
No investigated factors in this study could
identify those PSC patients who would later
develop cholangiocarcinoma. The detection
rate of cholangiocarcinoma in 8% of the
patients is comparable with that of other
studies. It is probably an underestimation,
however, as 3 1O% of all patients who died did
not have a necropsy. Furthermore, cholangio￾carcinoma is often difficult to diagnose in
living patients with PSC.8 9 1820 Perhaps the
introduction of time dependent variables into a
dynamic prognostic model could be of value in
the identification of PSC patients at risk for
malignant transformation of the bile ducts.2'
We conclude that although genetic differ￾ences exist concerning HLA class II antigen
association between Swedish, American, and
English patients,22-26 the natural history and
factors of prognostic importance seem more to
