ABSTRACT
Objective: to assess the relationship between health-related quality of life with depression 
and self-esteem of people after kidney transplantation. Method: a cross-sectional study of 
47 outpatients from October 2016 to February 2017. The following tools were applied: The 
Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, Beck Depression Inventory 
and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Descriptive statistics and Spearman correlation were 
used. Results: women had lower scores for health-related quality of life. Young adults, 
people with up to one and a half years of transplantation and those who had dialysis for 
more than one year had higher scores. Conclusion: the health-related quality of life of 
people with chronic kidney disease after transplantation ranged from good to excellent. 
The presence of depression was not identified. The relationship of data indicates that the 
higher the quality of life, the better the self-esteem assessment.

Relationship between quality of life, self-esteem and depression in people after kidney transplantation
Rocha FL, Echevarria-Guanilo ME, Silva DMGV, Gonçalves N, Lopes SGR, Boell JEW, et al. 
INTRODUCTION
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) represents a major public health 
issue worldwide(1-2). The prevalence of CKD in the population is 
over 10%, and over 50% in high risk populations (people with 
high blood pressure and Diabetes Mellitus)(3). In Brazil, data from 
2013 identified approximately 100,397 patients with CKD(4). The 
treatment modalities in CKD include the renal replacement func￾tions, being performed by hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and 
kidney transplantation, where none of them is considered as a 
curative measure(5-7). In this context, kidney transplantation, when 
successful, is considered a therapeutic modality that increases 
the chances of returning to the routine of life before the onset of 
the disease. It provides people with greater freedom, autonomy, 
life perspective and, consequently, a higher quality of life for the 
patient when compared to dialysis treatment(8-10).
Quality of life assessment in people with chronic diseases al￾lows the identification of aspects that influence the perception of 
this condition regarding their own existence and about changes 
attributed by the disease and treatment. Thus, health-related 
quality of life is a condition based on one’s experience, whether 
due to the effects of the disease or the way the treatment impacts 
on one’s daily life, as well as one’s satisfaction with the treatment. 
In the case of kidney transplantation, which does not represent 
the cure of the disease, the person remains in the condition of 
chronic patient and subject to continuous treatment(11-12).
Transplantation implies changes and adaptations, especially 
regarding the post-transplantation period, when the person 
presents emotional needs in face of his new clinical condition, 
needing to prepare for living in family life and insertion in soci￾ety(13). Moreover, they also require ongoing health care assistance, 
such as the use of immunosuppressive drugs and outpatient 
follow-up, which also impacts their quality of life(8). Depression is 
an important emotional change that is associated with impaired 
quality of life and increased morbidity and mortality in end-stage 
kidney disease patients. Little is known about the prevalence 
of depression in kidney transplant recipients. However, when 
compared to the dialysis modality, kidney transplantation is as￾sociated with better clinical outcomes, better quality of life and 
lower rates of psychic morbidity(14).
Kidney transplantation offers significant survival advantages, 
bringing emotional and psychological benefits to patients. 
However, there are new concerns, such as fear of losing the new 
kidney and complications that can lead to emotional distress, 
generating feelings of expectations, feelings, uncertainties and 
frustrations with the transplanted kidney(15-16). Furthermore, 
self-esteem is considered an important indicator of mental 
health, in the sense of intervening in the affective, social and 
psychological conditions of individuals, which consequently 
interferes with well-being and quality of life(17). Considering 
the above, studying depression and self-esteem of people after 
kidney transplantation and its relationship with Health-Related 
Quality of Life (HRQoL) can point to results that contribute to 
early detection and intervention in the context of self-esteem 
and depression, besides showing results that contribute to the 
quality of care provided by healthcare professionals regarding 
HRQoL for kidney transplant recipients. 
OBJECTIVE
To assess the relationship between health-related quality 
of life with depression and self-esteem of people after kidney 
transplantation in a health service in the city of Florianópolis, 
Santa Catarina State.
METHOD
Ethical aspects
The project was approved by the Research Ethics Committee 
with Human Beings of Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina. 
Patients were approached by the principal researcher in the 
transplant ambulatory waiting room and informed about the 
research objectives. Interested parties signed the Free and In￾formed Consent Term. 
Design, place of study, and period
Trata-se de um estudo de abordagem quantitativa do tipo 
transversal, de amostra não probabilística, realizado no Ambu￾latório Pós-Transplante de Rim localizado em um hospital público 
no município de Florianópolis, SC, no período de outubro de 
2016 a fevereiro de 2017
Population or sample; inclusion and exclusion criteria
The study population consisted of people who underwent 
kidney transplantation from October 2011 to October 2016. 
102 people were registered for this period; of these, eight had 
rejection of the transplanted kidney and six died. Thus, 88 people 
were potential participants, and 47 had scheduled follow-up 
appointments during the collection period (October 2016 to 
February 2017). For sample composition, the inclusion criteria 
were men or women aged 18 years or older; being in the post￾transplantation period between three months to five years; 
and perform outpatient follow-up at the referred hospital. The 
study would not include people with clinical instability (which 
generated the need for hospitalization); and who did not reach 
the minimum score in the Mini-Mental State Exam (20 points).
Study protocol 
A characterization tool developed by the researchers was 
used to obtain sociodemographic data (gender, age, marital 
status, schooling, profession, monthly income) and clinical 
data (type and dialysis time, type, and time after kidney trans￾plantation). To assess quality of life, the Brazilian version of the 
Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey 
was used, consisting of 11 questions and 36 items organized 
in eight domains: functional capacity, physical aspects, pain, 
general state of health, vitality, social aspects, emotional as￾pects, mental health and one-year health changes. The scores 
for each domain range from zero (0) to one hundred (100), with 
0 being the worst score and 100 being the best(18). From the 
health-related quality of life scores in transplanted people, this 
was classified as low, 0 to 55 points, good, 55 to 70 points and

Rocha FL, Echevarria-Guanilo ME, Silva DMGV, Gonçalves N, Lopes SGR, Boell JEW, et al. 
excellent, 70 to 100 points(19). To assess depressive symptoms, 
the validated Portuguese version of the Beck Depression Inven￾tory (BDI) was used, consisting of 21 items assessed from four 
response alternatives (zero to three points), reaching a total of 
63. The higher the total scale values, the greater the depression. 
Thus, for scores greater than 15, a patient with dysphoria was 
included(20-21). Self-esteem was assessed using the Rosenberg 
Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), used in its version adapted to Portu￾guese. This tool consists of 10 items, with scores from 0 to 3. As 
a total value, the scale can range from 10 to 40 points, and the 
higher the score, the higher the self-esteem(22).
Analysis of results, and statistics
For data analysis, the Statistical Package for Social Sciences 
SPSS® version 20 for Windows program was used. Descriptive 
analysis of data, central tendency and dispersion of quantitative 
variables were performed. Cronbach’s alpha was obtained from 
each of the scales (internal consistency assessment of the scale 
in the study sample) and Sperman correlation. For Cronbach’s 
alpha assessment, values above 0.50 were considered accept￾able values; for the values of the correlation coefficients, it was 
considered as <0.30 weak; between 0.30 and 0.50 as moderate 
and> 0.50 as strong correlations(23-24).
RESULTS
The sample of this research comprised 47 people, of which 
more than half were male (55%), mean age 45.47 years (SD: 10.9), 
married (57.4%), with high school degree, (75.6%) and had some 
professional activity (70.2%). The duration of dialysis treatment 
until kidney transplantation ranged from 0 to 7 years, and of these 
patients, 40.4% underwent up to 2 years. Among the dialysis 
treatment modalities, 93.6% underwent hemodialysis and 70.2% 
had been transplanted for more than one and a half years, being 
recipients of deceased donor organ (87.2%) (Table 1).
In assessing internal consistency by obtaining Cronbach’s alpha 
from the HRQoL scale, high alpha was obtained (α: 0.839). With 
regards to means scores, they ranged from good to excellent in 
the ‘emotional aspects’ (M: 70.21; SD: 19.53), ‘social aspects’ (M: 
78.72; SD: 26.05) and ‘functional capacity’ (M: 81.06; SD: 24.24). 
In relation to self-esteem assessment, a median score of 24.10 
(SD: 3.79) was found, ranging from 17 to 35 points. Regarding 
depression assessment, 75% of people were not classified as 
dysphoria, as they had values with low means of 10.27 (SD: 
10.39). Internal consistency assessment of the measurement 
for both scales presented a high Cronbach’s alpha α: 0.866 and 
α: 0.916, respectively.
It was evidenced in the context of the HRQoL assessment that 
women obtained lower values when related to men in ‘functional 
capacity’, which showed a mean score difference of 9.24; the ‘social 
aspect’, with mean difference of 12.11 and ‘physical aspect’ of 7.6 
points. Only ‘vitality’ was low for both genders (65.76 and 63.80 
for men and women, respectively). Regarding the self-esteem 
assessment, no wide differences in means scores were observed 
between men and women. Women had a higher mean score in 
the depression assessment (M: 11.61; SD: 11.51) (Table 2).

The HRQOL assessment showed means differences between scores 
in ‘emotional aspect’ (24.27 points), ‘pain’ (7.83 points) and ‘mental 
health’ (5.6 points), all with higher values in the respondents who 
were <60 years old. In the depression assessment, the young adult 
(31-50 years) presented lower mean score (M: 7.82; SD: 5.49), and in 
the self-esteem assessment, no differences were observed (Table 2).
In HRQoL depression and self-esteem variables assessment, con￾sidering transplantation time, it is possible to observe that people 
with up to one and a half years of transplant had higher mean values 
in all domains. ‘Functional capacity’ (M: 83.92; SD: 22.80), ‘vitality’ (M: 
66.07; SD: 19.62) and ‘general state of health’ (M: 73.85; SD:13.69) had 
a higher transplant time score of up to one and a half years. When 
compared to transplant time longer than one year, HRQoL variables 
obtained lower values in all domains, plus self-esteem (Table 3).
In the context of HRQoL assessment, related to dialysis time 
of up to one year, lower mean values were evidenced for ‘vitality’ 
(M: 60.26; SD: 25.30) and ‘general state of health’ (M: 60.89; SD: 
13.56). There was an increase in the low score mean of ≤9.36 (SD: 
9.58) in the depression assessment and mean score in relation to

of health’ (M: 69.50; SD: 16.99). Regarding depression and self￾esteem assessments, both evidenced low (Table 3).
By analyzing the relationship between the values obtained 
in the HRQoL domains and those of depression, moderate and 
negative correlations were identified, which ranged from -0.308 
(p<0.05) for ‘social aspect’ to -0.477 (p<0.01) for ‘vitality’. ‘Mental 
health’ had a strong negative correlation -0.533 (p<0.01). With 
regards to correlations between the values of the HRQoL and 
self-esteem domains, moderate and positive correlations were 
identified, ranging from 0.301 (p<0.05) for ‘functional capacity’ to 
0.483 (p<0, 01) for ‘vitality’. ‘Mental health’ had a strong negative 
correlation -0.503 (p<0.01). The scores obtained by correlating 
depression with self-esteem were strong and negative (-0.606; 
p<0.01) (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
Sociodemographic characteristics of the studied population, 
such as male gender, marital status, professional activity, are 
similar to study results that aimed to assess HRQoL after kidney 
transplantation(8). Likewise, age and education, presented by 
respondents in a study conducted to assess variables that influ￾enced the quality of life of people after kidney transplantation, 
was similar to the study population, presenting mean age of 44.5 
years and complete high school(25). Moreover, it is important to 
highlight that low schooling and inequalities in access to infor￾mation are determining factors when it comes to people with 
chronic noncommunicable diseases(26). 
Regarding dialysis time, the present study highlighted a 
time of less than two years, which shows the participation of 
people with short hemodialysis, since previous studies include 
the participation of people with greater time. A study aimed at 
analyzing the association between the duration of pre-transplant 
replacement renal therapy in relation to patient and transplant 
survival found that the mean time of hemodialysis in the study 
population ranged from five to 10 years (31.2%), followed by 
three to five years (27.2%) and zero to three years (23.8%)(27). 
Furthermore, research on transplant waiting time showed that 
the dialysis time for living donor transplant recipients and for 
deceased donor transplantation was from one year and six months 
to three years and seven months(28). 
The Brazilian national health system performance has focused 
on actions aimed at reducing the waiting time of patients on the 
transplant list, contributing to the improvement of the quality of 
life of patients waiting for the procedure. High organ transplan￾tation rates give Brazil a prominent role in the world, as 87% of 
these transplants are done with public resources(29). 
Regarding the origin of the transplanted organ, considering 
important aspects as a result of the prognosis, it confers greater 
survival of people after living donor transplantation. Authors point 
out that most of the transplanted organs come from deceased 
donors, giving a longer time after transplantation from living 
donors(30). However, many factors prevent organs from being 
obtained from a living donor, including the donor’s short and long 
term health risks, without any apparent health benefit, operative 
trauma, stress, and financial and occupational disadvantages(31). 
Regarding HRQoL and post-kidney transplantation, the domains 
presented scores that ranged from good to excellent quality of 
life, highlighting “vitality”, with the lowest score and “functional 
capacity” with the highest score. It is noteworthy that the sample 
studied had the largest number of participants whose score was 
rated excellent for the eight domains of the SF-36 tool. Results 
similar to those identified in a study in which HRQoL, as assessed 
by SF-36 before transplantation and after two years afterwards, 
presented high values in all previously mentioned domains, 
totaling 1,137.9 points before transplantation and 1,458, re￾spectively. 9 points at 2 years after transplantation(32). A study in 
which the HRQoL of people on hemodialysis was assessed from 
the application of SF-36, when compared to ‘functional capacity’ 
scored lower (40.2), followed by ‘vitality’ (41, 2) and ‘general state 
of health’ (43.1). These results suggest that the experience of 
hemodialysis has a negative impact on HRQoL, which improves 
after kidney transplantation(33).
The present study showed that the studied population did 
not present scores for the dysphoria classification. This result is 
in line with research in the area that evidenced in both pre and 
post-kidney transplant people a medium severity risk for depres￾sive symptoms, given the application of the Hospital Anxiety and 
Depression Scale (HADS) scale, with lower prevalence of depres￾sive symptoms in transplanted individuals(14). These results, when

Relationship between quality of life, self-esteem and depression in people after kidney transplantation
Rocha FL, Echevarria-Guanilo ME, Silva DMGV, Gonçalves N, Lopes SGR, Boell JEW, et al. 
compared to patients on hemodialysis, show a 22% proportion 
of patients with increased BDI indexes, suggesting a high rate 
of depression for patients on hemodialysis compared to kidney 
transplantation(34). Thus, it can be inferred that, as HRQoL scores 
increase after kidney transplantation, the manifestation of depres￾sion and anxiety would improve (lower scores) in this condition.
In this sense, the present study showed higher values in HRQOL 
assessment in patients with dialysis time above one and a half 
years, compared to people with shorter time. Studies show that 
people who have had long-term hemodialysis treatment have 
greater capacity for post-transplant care, even in the early period. 
People with less time on hemodialysis show greater difficulties 
in the new treatment, because they have not experienced the 
physical and social deterioration that CKD can bring(35). 
In the correlations study between the studied variables, it was 
possible to verify the existence of significant moderate negative 
correlations, specifically between ‘pain’, ‘general state of health’, 
‘vitality’, ‘social aspect’, ‘emotional aspect’. There was a strong nega￾tive correlation in ‘mental health’ associated with BDI. These results 
reinforce the inference that the better the HRQOL assessment, 
the better the depression assessment. In other words, the lower 
values will be identified when it is assessed. Psycho-emotional 
preparation is an important aspect to be considered by health 
and nursing professionals in the transplantation process, since 
this procedure is also mediated by anxieties and anguish(35).
Study limitations
There is an emphasis on the need for replication of the pres￾ent research with larger sample groups, as well as in different 
economic and social realities. 
Contributions to nursing, health or public policy
The study highlights the importance of orientation to trans￾planted people that should be performed by health professionals, 
especially the nursing staff. It is considered necessary for it to 
play the role of health education for transplanted people and 
their families in the preoperative period, preparing them and 
informing them about their responsibilities, as well as clarifying 
any doubts. Nevertheless, it should establish the line of commu￾nication between patient and family with the multidisciplinary 
team in order to establish a care planning in order to minimize 
the challenges arising from the transplant and compromise the 
quality of life of these people.
CONCLUSION
Health-related quality of life scores ranged from good to 
excellent across all SF-36 domains, with ‘vitality’ being the most 
affected domain. Best HRQoL ratings are presented by young 
adults, except for ‘physical aspect’ and ‘general state of health’. 
People with up to one and a half years of transplantation who 
underwent dialysis for more than one year had higher scores in 
all domains, except for ‘emotional aspect’ in the latter case. There 
were correlations between the SF-36 domains and BDI. Moderate 
and negative were: ‘pain’, ‘general state of health’, ‘vitality’, ‘social 
aspect’, ‘emotional aspect’. There was a strong negative correla￾tion for ‘mental health’. Regarding the correlations between the 
SF-36 domains and RSES, moderate and positive correlations 
were identified for ‘functional capacity’, ‘pain’, ‘general state of 
health’, ‘vitality’, ‘emotional aspect’ and negative strong correla￾tion for ‘mental health’.
