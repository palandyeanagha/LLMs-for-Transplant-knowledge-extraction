Abstract
Background: Perioperative bleeding and transfusion are important causes of morbidity and mortality in patients
undergoing liver transplantation. The aim of this study is to assess whether viscoelastic tests-guided therapy with
the use of synthetic factor concentrates impact transfusion rates of hemocomponents in adult patients undergoing
liver transplantation.
Methods: This is an interventional before-after comparative study. Patients undergoing liver transplantation before
the implementation of a protocol using thromboelastometry and synthetic factor concentrates were compared to
patients after the implementation. Primary outcome was transfusion of any hemocomponents. Secondary
outcomes included: transfusion of red blood cells (RBC), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), cryoprecipitate or platelets,
clinical complications, length of stay and in-hospital mortality.
Results: A total of 183 patients were included in the control and 54 in the intervention phase. After propensity
score matching, the proportion of patients receiving any transfusion of hemocomponents was lower in the
intervention phase (37.0 vs 58.4%; OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.20–0.87; p = 0.019). Patients in the intervention phase received
less RBC (30.2 vs 52.5%; OR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.08–0.56; p = 0.002) and FFP (5.7 vs 27.3%; OR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.03–0.43; p =
0.002). There was no difference regarding transfusion of cryoprecipitate and platelets, complications related to the
procedure, hospital length of stay and mortality.
Conclusions: Use of a viscoelastic test-guided transfusion algorithm with the use of synthetic factor concentrates
reduces the transfusion rates of allogenic blood in patients submitted to liver transplantation.
Trial registration: This trial was registered retrospectively on November 15th, 2018 – clinicaltrials.gov – Identifier:

Introduction
Perioperative bleeding is one of the most important causes
of morbidity and mortality in liver transplantation [1].
However, blood transfusion, used to correct hemorrhage
and coagulopathy, is directly associated with an increase in
infectious and respiratory complications [2, 3], longer
intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, and a higher rate of
reoperations [4–6], increasing mortality among these
patients [7]. In addition, transfusion of packed red blood
cells (RBC) was shown to be associated with the incidence
of hepatic artery thrombosis [8] and the use of cryoprecipi￾tate, platelets and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) associated with
decreased graft survival at one and five years [9]. The deci￾sion to transfuse a patient undergoing liver transplantation
presents as a challenge, and more than a half of patients
undergoing liver transplantation still require transfusion of
some blood product components in the perioperative
period [9–15].
Patients with advanced liver diseases present with
changes in coagulation and hemostasis, including an
elevated international normalized ratio (INR), decreased
levels of fibrinogen and a decreased platelet count, and
these abnormal values suggest a state of hypocoagulabil￾ity [16]. However, thrombin generating capacity is nor￾mal or even increased in this group of patients when
compared to healthy controls [17, 18], and the platelets
are qualitatively capable of withstanding adequate
thrombin generation when their total count is around
50–60 × 109
/l [19]. Other features of a hypercoagulable
profile include increased von Willebrand factor levels,
high amounts of procoagulant platelet-derived micropar￾ticles and a hypofibrinolytic state [20]. At the end,
hemostasis finds a new and fragile equilibrium [16] and
the isolated conventional laboratory tests are inefficient
to evaluate the coagulation status [21, 22].
Thromboelastography (TEG®, Haemoscope / Haemo￾netics, Niles, Ill) as a method to assess global hemostatic
function through a simple blood sample was described in
1948 and has been used in liver transplantation since the
1980s [23, 24]. Rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM®)
adopts the same principles of TEG, as a method that assess
the viscoelastic property of whole blood allowing the evalu￾ation of the initiation, formation, stability and lysis of the
clot [23]. These point-of-care (POC) tests have become
complementary tools to traditional static tests [25, 26], and
recent studies have shown that coagulation assessment and
viscoelastic tests-guided therapy during high risk proce￾dures, such as cardiovascular surgery and trauma, can have
a significant impact on the reduction of transfusion of
blood products and also in the morbidity and mortality of
the patients [27, 28].
Some studies support the use of viscoelastic tests
(VET) in the management of perioperative liver trans￾plant coagulation [29–31], adding valuable real-time
information during the different stages of surgery. How￾ever, strategies based on these tests are still under devel￾opment and the best triggers for blood transfusion are
not completely known. Prior to 2007, patients in Brazil
were transplanted in order of waiting list, regardless of
disease severity, causing patients to undergo liver trans￾plantation at very different stages of the disease [32],
with subsequent lower transfusion rates during proced￾ure [33]. The adoption of the ‘Model for End-Stage Liver
Disease’ (MELD) as an organ allocation method in
places with low offers of organs for donation has chan￾ged this practice. Although currently evidence suggest
benefit of the use of VET in this group of patients, the
impact of this intervention in patients undergoing liver
transplantation in Brazil according to the MELD system
is not known.
The aim of the present before-after study is to assess
whether VET-guided therapy with the use of synthetic
factor concentrates (fibrinogen concentrate [FC] and
prothrombin complex concentrate [PCC]) is associated
with decreased transfusion of blood product compo￾nents in adult patients undergoing liver transplantation
in a private hospital in Brazil using MELD as an organ
allocation method.
Methods
Ethics statement
The protocol was approved by the local ethics commit￾tee of Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein (Comitê de Ética
do Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil).
Written consent was applied to patients in the prospect￾ive group (intervention group), and was waived in the
retrospective group (control group).
Patients and setting
The present study was performed in the operating room
and in the ICU of a private teaching hospital. Data from
adult patients undergoing liver transplantation were col￾lected and analyzed. All patients undergoing deceased
donor liver transplantation for chronic liver disease were
considered for inclusion, and in our center split organs
and donation after circulatory death are not used. The
following exclusion criteria were considered: transplant￾ation due to acute liver failure, age < 18 years old, com￾bined transplant recipients (e.g., liver and kidney) and
those who require re-transplantation in less than thirty
days after the first transplant.
General Care for Liver Transplantation
Patients were admitted to the operating room without
receiving any pre-anesthetic medication, and were moni￾tored with electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry and
bi-spectral index (BIS). A 16-gauge venous access and a
radial arterial line were acquired before anesthetic
Zamper et al. BMC Anesthesiology (2018) 18:198 Page 2 of 12

induction. After intubation, a central venous access was
obtained in jugular vein preferably, and all patients were
monitored with transesophageal echocardiography
(TEE).
In a specific group of patients, a pulmonary-artery cath￾eter was also used (presence of pulmonary hypertension,
cardiomyopathy, or a MELD score above 30). The type of
anesthesia (total intravenous or balanced) was left at the
discretion of the anesthesiologist. During the whole period
the same groups of anesthesiologists and surgeons were
responsible for all the liver transplantations. All patients
used elastic stockings and an intermittent pneumatic com￾pressor in the lower limbs, and prophylactic heparin was
not allowed during the hospitalization according to insti￾tutional protocol. At the end, all patients were referred to
the ICU.
Study protocol
Study design
A before-after study design was used. The before period
(control phase) consisted of patients undergoing liver
transplantation who were operated between 2007 and
2009, at least five years before the implementation of a
protocol using VET and synthetic factor concentrates. We
opted for patients operated during this period to avoid a
bias, because before 2009 we did not have neither syn￾thetic factor concentrates for using in these patients nor
POC-VET available in our center.
The intervention phase consisted of patients undergo￾ing liver transplantation operated during a 10-month
period after this implementation (January 2015 to Octo￾ber 2015). Although this strategy led to a gap of at least
five years between control and intervention cases, the
team of surgeons and anesthesiologists remained the
same, both with more than five years of experience in
liver transplantation.
Control phase
In the control phase, transfusion of RBC was triggered by
either a hemoglobin (Hb) value below 7.0 g/dL or by signs
of hemodynamic instability (persistent hypotension, tachy￾cardia, low arterial oxygen content, severe and acute
bleeding with hypotension). Strategy of transfusion and
choice of blood product to treat coagulopathies was per￾formed guided by previous laboratory results of conven￾tional coagulation tests when there was clinical evidence
of coagulopathy, active bleeding and normal metabolic
profile (pH, temperature and serum calcium). Synthetic
factor concentrates were available, but we did not have in￾stitutional authorization for using them in an off-label set￾ting, so the patients in the control phase did not receive
these concentrates.
Antifibrinolytics were used prophylactically in all cases
when there was no history of inflammatory diseases
from the biliary tract, hepatocellular carcinoma and no
previous thromboembolic event. There was no fluid ad￾ministration protocol, but in our practice, we use albumin
combined with crystalloids and tend to be restrictive with
fluids administration, using the four chambers view on
TEE to estimate if the heart is empty, hyperdynamic or
dysfunctional. This evaluation associated with assessment
of the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and central venous
pressure (CVP) supported our decisions on fluid
resuscitation.
ROTEM® was not available during this period. We per￾formed a retrospective analysis of prospectively recorded
data regarding demographic characteristics, laboratory
tests, medications, surgical characteristics, strategy of fluid
replacement, use of blood products (blood product com￾ponents), vital signs, general complications after surgery,
including thromboembolic complications (myocardial
infarction, stroke, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary
thromboembolism or portal thrombosis), postoperative
duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU and hospital
length of stay, and mortality.
Intervention phase
During a 10-month period, the recommended procedure
was to treat coagulopathies according to a strategy of
transfusion based on the results of VET and to use
synthetic factor concentrates instead of hemocompo￾nents. As in the control phase, transfusion of RBC was
triggered by either a Hb value under 7,0 g/L or by signs
of hemodynamic instability and fluid resuscitation was
exactly as in the control group. Patients were followed
until hospital discharge or death, whichever came first.
Coagulation treatment was indicated when there was a
clinical coagulopathy with bleeding, and management
was based on a POC-VET algorithm adapted from those
used in cardiovascular surgeries, designed in conjunction
with hematologists and experts in the area and using an
earlier amplitude evaluation in the EXTEM at the fifth
minute (A5EX) (Fig. 1) [34]. Antifibrinolytics were indi￾cated when there was no history of inflammatory
diseases from the biliary tract, hepatocellular carcinoma,
no previous thromboembolic event, and if the A5EX
amplitude was under 15 mm in the ROTEM® performed
in the beginning of the anesthesia.
ROTEM® was performed in the following moments: in
the preoperative period within the routine laboratory
exams in the ward, 15 min after arterial reperfusion, six
hours after the end of the transplant in the ICU and at
any time when the team considered necessary based on
clinical aspects of the surgical field.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was a collapsed composite of need
of any transfusion of blood product during surgery and
Zamper et al. BMC Anesthesiology (2018) 18:198 Page 3 of 12

in the first 48 h in the postoperative, and this included
the need of RBC, FFP, cryoprecipitate and/or platelets.
Secondary outcomes were: 1) use of synthetic factor
concentrates or antifibrinolytic; 2) clinical complications
related to the procedure; 3) postoperative duration of
ventilation in days; 4) ICU and hospital length of stay in
days; and 5) in-hospital mortality.
Statistical analysis
The control phase has been set to liver transplantations
performed between 2007 and 2009 and the intervention
phase 10-months duration a priori. The control to inter￾vention ratio was set as 3:1. The primary analysis con￾sisted in comparing any transfusion of blood product
components between the two phases by means of a
chi-square test. To consider potential bias associated
with the before-after design, we performed two analyses
with an adjustment for demographic characteristics.
First, a multivariate analysis was performed using a
logistic or a linear regression model including variables
differing between the two phases in bivariate analyses
and those already know as prognostic factors for transfu￾sion in liver transplantation. Variables used for adjust￾ment were age, MELD score, Child-Pugh classification,
presence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and
preoperative levels of albumin, urea, creatinine and
hemoglobin. Second, a propensity score method was
applied to balance covariates in the two phases and to
reduce bias. Propensity scores were estimated for each
patient with logistic regression using age, Child-Pugh,
MELD, presence of HCC and preoperative levels of
hemoglobin as co-variates. The propensity score reflects
the propensity in the range of 0 to 1 to be in the inter￾vention phase given a set of known variables and is an
attempt to adjust for potential selection bias, confound￾ing factors, and differences between groups. Patients

with missing data were excluded from the analysis.
Based on the propensity score weighted estimators for
the data we constructed a propensity score–matched co￾hort. Matching was performed using nearest neighbor
matching without replacement, with each patient from
the intervention phase matched to two patients of the
control phase. A caliper width of 0.1 of the standard de￾viation of the logit of the propensity score was used for
the development of matching.
A logistic or a linear regression was performed on this
matched sample. All results are presented as odds ratio
(OR) and it 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for logistic
regression or the β coefficient and it 95% CI for linear
regression.
Normality of the variables was tested with a
Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test. Continuous parametric data
were expressed as the mean (SD), and nonparametric data
were expressed as median and interquartile range. Categor￾ical data were expressed as absolute numbers and percent￾age. For demographic characteristics Student t test was
used as appropriate. All analyses were conducted with SPSS
v.20 (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20.0.
Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.), and R v.2.12.0. For all analyses
two–sided p values < 0.05 were considered significant.
Results
Population
Demographic characteristics of included population are
reported in Table 1. One hundred and eighty-three
patients were included in the control and fifty-four in
the intervention phase. At baseline, patients in the
intervention phase had lower incidence of chronic
kidney disease, encephalopathy and upper digestive
hemorrhage, lower preoperative levels of creatinine and
urea and higher levels of albumin (Table 1). However,
there were no differences between the groups when
comparing MELD scores. The characteristics of the
groups were more balanced after the propensity-score
matching (Table 1).
Postoperative and surgical characteristics
The clamping and ischemia time was lower in the inter￾vention phase compared to the control phase (Table 2).
Intraoperatively, patients in the intervention phase re￾ceived less fluid and had lower fluid balance than pa￾tients in the control phase. At the end of the surgery,
patients in the intervention phase presented with a lower
heart rate, CVP, and temperature and higher MAP and
dose of norepinephrine compared to patients in the con￾trol phase (Table 2).
Primary outcome
The proportion of patients receiving any transfusion of
blood product components was 35.2% in the intervention
phase and 56.3% in the control phase (p = 0.006) (Table 3).
When considering the adjustment for potential con￾founders, patients in the intervention phase still had a
lower risk of any transfusion of blood product compo￾nents compared to those in the control phase (adjusted
OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.10–0.63; p = 0.003) (Additional file 1:
Table S1). After propensity score matching, the proportion
of patients that received any transfusion of blood product
components was still lower in the intervention phase (37.0
vs 58.4%; p = 0.018; OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.20–0.87; p =
0.019) (Table 3 and Additional file 1: Table S2).
Patients in the intervention phase received less RBC
(30.2 vs 52.5%; p = 0.004; adjusted OR, 0.21; 95% CI,
0.08–0.56; p = 0.002) and FFP (5.7 vs 27.3%; p < 0.001;
adjusted OR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.03–0.43; p = 0.002) (Table 3
and Additional file 1: Table S1). There was no difference
regarding transfusion of cryoprecipitate and platelets.
Secondary outcomes
Secondary outcomes are provided in Tables 3 and 4. The
use of hemoderivates was higher in the intervention
phase (35.2 vs 0.0%; p < 0.001) and the use of antifibrino￾lytic agents was lower (14.8 vs 42.3%; p < 0.001; adjusted
OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.13–0.80; p = 0.015) (Table 3 and
Additional file 1: Table S1). The results after the propen￾sity score matching yielded the same results (Table 3
and Additional file 1: Table S2).
There was no difference regarding complications re￾lated to the procedure, duration of mechanical ventila￾tion, ICU length of stay and hospital mortality among
the two groups (Table 4 and Additional file 1: Table S3).
However, hospital length of stay in survivors was lower in
the intervention phase (11.3 ± 7.2 vs 16.3 ± 12.7 days; p =
0.007; adjusted β coefficient, − 5.84; 95% CI, − 9.77 –
-1.91; p = 0.004) (Table 4 and Additional file 1: Table S3).
After propensity score matching, there was only a trend
toward decreased hospital length of stay in survivors in
the intervention phase (11.6 ± 7.5 vs 15.1 ± 11.4 days; p =
0.066; adjusted β coefficient, − 3.53; 95% CI, − 7.22 – 0.17;
p = 0.061) (Table 4 and Additional file 1: Table S4).
Discussion
In this observational study the use of a transfusion algo￾rithm based on ROTEM® and on the use of synthetic
factor concentrates resulted in a reduction in transfusion
rates of any blood product components, and in a reduc￾tion in the use of antifibrinolytic medications. No patient
in the treatment group developed any major complica￾tions related to the use of the protocol.
The present study is unprecedented when introducing
to liver transplantations a VET-based transfusion algo￾rithm including the use of synthetic factor concentrates
and using prospectively an earlier amplitude evaluation
in the EXTEM at the fifth minute (A5EX), and

associating it with the amplitude of FIBTEM at the tenth
minute (A10FIB) to support transfusion therapy with ei￾ther fibrinogen or platelets.
The perioperative period of liver transplantation may
result in hemostatic unbalance and massive bleeding,
which often leads to a treatment based on most probable
deficiencies or on laboratory results that do not reflect
in vivo hemostasis. Indeed, recent studies emphasize
that conventional coagulation tests have significant limi￾tations in this scenario, such as a longer time to provide
useful results, absence of correlation with the risk of in￾traoperative bleeding, and lack of evaluation of anti￾coagulant factors, fibrinolysis and platelet dysfunction
[25, 35–38].
This study supports the results of previous studies that
showed the effectiveness of VET in the evaluation and
treatment of bleeding in high complex surgeries such as
cardiovascular [39], trauma [40] and liver transplantations
surgeries [29, 30, 41, 42]. The use of synthetic factor con￾centrates (FC and PCC) in the context of coagulopathies
requiring treatment, although still an off-label treatment,
has been investigated previously, and a recent study
showed the safety of this therapeutic option in liver trans￾plant patients [43]. In our study we used synthetic factor
concentrates predominately, as a good alternative to re￾place FFP and cryoprecipitate transfusions, avoiding their
intrinsic complications.
FC has been shown to be effective in the treatment of
patients with hypofibrinogenemia in obstetric [44], car￾diac [45], and trauma surgeries [46], improving clot
function and reducing bleeding. Some authors argue that
in situations where cryoprecipitate is indicated, replace￾ment with FC offers advantages from the point of view
of efficacy and safety [47]. Alternatives to the treatment
of hypofibrinogenemia are limited. FFP contains insuffi￾cient amounts of fibrinogen [48] and is inefficient in the
clinical situations in which it is used for fibrinogen
replacement [49]. Cryoprecipitate is the therapy of
choice, but offers high risks of complications such as
transmission of infectious diseases, acute lung injury and
immuno-mediated complications, increasing morbidity
and mortality in transfused patients. Besides, high con￾tents of von-Willebrand factor, factors VIII and XIII can
potentially lead to hypercoagulation in the setting of
endothelial dysfunction, contributing to the development
of thromboembolic events [50–52].
It is important to note that although we did not find a
difference between cryoprecipitate transfusion rates in
both groups, the use of VET led to an increase in the
general indication of fibrinogen replacement in the inter￾vention group, which was done with FC. One possible
explanation is that the faster evaluation of coagulation
when using VET directed the treatment of coagulopathy
with replacement. It is known that the majority of pa￾tients undergoing liver transplantation present intraop￾erative hypofibrinogenemia [53, 54].
FFP remains the main therapy for multifactorial coag￾ulopathy observed in hepatic transplantation [55–57],
and PCC was initially presented as an option for reversal
of coumarin anticoagulant agents [58]. Although it does

not contain all the factors present in FFP, since it is com￾posed of the vitamin K dependent factors (II, VII, IX and
X) and protein C and S anticoagulant factors, the PCC
contains important effectors in the coagulation, and
therefore, it is an alternative in cases in which the FFP is

events, and offers the advantage of lower risk of infec￾tion transmission and transfusion reactions when com￾pared to FFP, besides low impact on the patient’s blood

dilutional anemias [58, 60]. In the present study we did
not find any difference in the incidence of thrombotic
complications between the phases studied. A recent
study showed that PCC may be more effective than FFP
to restore thrombin generation in patients undergoing
liver transplantation, and that the required dose is less
than the dose used for warfarin reversal [61].
Transfusional triggers associated to VET are not well
stablished in the scientific literature. Most of the studies
that propose an algorithm based on VET use the evalu￾ation of the amplitude in the EXTEM at the tenth mi￾nute (A10EX) [36, 41, 57, 62]. The use of A5EX has
already been shown as an effective parameter to detect
thrombocytopenia and hypofibrinogenemia in patients
undergoing liver transplantation [63].
Hyperfibrinolysis is an important cause of bleeding in
patients undergoing liver transplantation [64]. Thus,
antifibrinolytic drugs are used to reduce blood loss and
transfusion of blood components, reducing costs and
complications, and the decision to use this resource
should be individualized because of the theoretical risk
of thromboembolic events, which is still a matter of
debate [65, 66]. The high incidence of fibrinolysis distur￾bances found in patients undergoing liver transplant￾ation has made the use of antifibrinolytics desirable in
the past, with the exclusion of patients who are more
prone to thrombotic events, such as patients with in￾flammatory diseases of the biliary tract, previous history
of thrombotic events and patients with cellular hepato￾carcinoma or other types of cancer. However, it has been
shown that in most situations where fibrinolysis is
present in a liver transplant, it is transient and do not
need intervention [67]. The introduction of ROTEM as
a tool for the evaluation of coagulation allows the identi￾fication of patients who are prone to fibrinolysis and pa￾tients who are bleeding because of fibrinolysis, and these
are the patients who benefit from the use of antifibrino￾lytics [68, 69]. Such targeted treatment may be a possible
explanation of the reduction in the use of antifibrinoly￾tics observed in our study. Finally, it is important to
state that ROTEM can point to the possibility of hyperfi￾brinolysis if there is an increased clot lysis, but the diag￾nosis is possible after another specific test (APTEM) is
performed, showing an improvement with the use of
antifibrinolytic drugs, and this diagnosis takes time [70].
Our study has some limitations, including the small
sample size, single center design, and the use of
non-concurrent controls. We did not collect and include
in our models patients’ characteristics regarding ICU ad￾mission and the use of preoperative mechanical ventila￾tion, dialysis, and vasopressors. Furthermore, the
intervention and control periods occurred during differ￾ent periods, without blinding in the prospective group
and it is not possible to control practice parameters that
may have changed, for example if the surgeons became
more experienced, or if the anesthesiologist had more
attention to limiting blood products or a different
anesthesia practice pattern. Besides, we do not have data
on quantitative blood loss, there was not a standard
procedure to guide transfusions in the control group
and some patients in the intervention group needed
cryoprecipitate after the use of FC, possibly due to lack
of other coagulation factors not available in the synthetic
concentrate (factors VIII, XIII or von-Willebrand).
In conclusion, our data show that the introduction of
a VET-guided transfusion algorithm with the use of
synthetic factor concentrates reduces the transfusion
rates of allogenic blood in patients submitted to liver
transplantation without increasing the risk of throm￾bosis. Further studies are necessary to identify whether
there is an impact on the morbidity and mortality of
these patients.
