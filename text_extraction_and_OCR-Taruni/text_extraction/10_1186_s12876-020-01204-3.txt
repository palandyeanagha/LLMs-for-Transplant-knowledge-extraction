Abstract
Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is currently the most common cause of chronic liver disease
nowadays. Changes in diet and lifestyle have led to a dramatic increase in the prevalence of NAFLD around the
world. This meta-analysis is to investigate the efficacy of physical activity intervention on liver-specific endpoints in
the population with NAFLD, including hepatic enzyme, serum lipid, glucose metabolism and intra-hepatic lipid.
Methods: PubMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases were searched for randomized
clinical trials of physical activity intervention on NAFLD patients through April 20th, 2019. Effect sizes were reported
as standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Quality of included studies was assessed
according to the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Meta-analyses were conducted using random-effect or fixed-effect
models depending on the significance of heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses according to types and duration of
physical activity were conducted to investigate clinical variability.
Results: Nine studies with a cumulative total of 951 participants met selection criteria. Physical activity was found
associated with small reductions in hepatic enzyme parameters: ALT (SMD -0.17, 95% CI:-0.30 to − 0.05), AST (SMD
-0.25, 95% CI: − 0.38, − 0.13) and GGT (SMD -0.22, 95% CI: − 0.36, − 0.08). Significant small improvements were also
found in serum lipid parameters including TC (SMD = − 0.22, 95% CI: − 0.34, − 0.09), TG (SMD = − 0.18, 95% CI: − 0.31
to − 0.06) and LDL-C (SMD = − 0.26, 95% CI: − 0.39 to − 0.13). Significant improvement was also found in intra￾hepatic lipid content (SMD = − 0.21, 95% CI: − 0.36 to − 0.06) There was no difference between physical intervention
group and control group in HDL and three glucose metabolism parameters. Subgroup analysis suggested both
aerobic exercise alone and resistance exercise alone can improve most liver function and longer period of exercise
generally had better improvement effect.

Conclusions: Our findings suggest that physical activity alone can only slightly improve hepatic enzyme levels,
most serum lipid levels and intra-hepatic lipid content in non-diabetic patients with NAFLD.
Keywords: Physical activity, Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, Randomized controlled trials; meta-analysis
Background
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a multi￾system disease characterized with fat storage and hepatic
steatosis not caused by excessive drinking. NAFLD en￾compasses a wide histological spectrum ranging from
simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH),
liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, which can result in liver can￾cer. Nowadays, dramatic changes in the lifestyle and diet
of the global population are causing the prevalence of
NAFLD increasing rapidly, in parallel with that of obes￾ity and diabetes [1]. NAFLD is estimated to replace viral
hepatitis as the primary factor for end-stage liver disease
and liver transplantation by 2023 [2]. Globally, the
prevalence of NAFLD varies among different countries
and regions. Most Asian countries and developing coun￾tries have the low prevalence of NAFLD (about 10%),
while China and Japan, as well as the United States, Eur￾ope, Middle-East, Latin America and Australia, have the
high prevalence of NAFLD ranges from 20 to 30% [3].
Additionally, based on the result of one meta-analysis
from mainland China, the prevalence of NAFLD in
China is reaching 45% [4]. NAFLD is becoming one of
the most important public health issues around the
world. The first-line management for NAFLD is lifestyle
modification, including dietary restriction and increased
habitual physical activity [5]. Physical activity as a life￾style modification plays an important role in the devel￾opment of NAFLD. Previous studies found an inverse
relationship between physical activity and the risk of
NAFLD [6, 7]. However, clinical trials examining the
therapeutic benefit of physical activity in NAFLD have
reported inconsistent results [8, 9], and the effectiveness
and biological mechanism of physical activity, independ￾ent of diet, remain insufficient. NAFLD is strongly
associated with features of the metabolic syndrome, es￾pecially type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), as over 70% of
patients with T2DM have NAFLD [10]. However, the
causality between NAFLD and T2DM is not entirely
understood. Our objective, therefore, was to conduct a
meta-analysis of the pooled data from published ran￾domized controlled trails (RCTs) to evaluate the effect￾iveness of physical activity intervention on hepatic
enzyme, serum lipid metabolism, glucose metabolism
and intra-hepatic lipids content in non-diabetic patients
with NAFLD [11], which will provide substantial evi￾dence on whether physical activity intervention has a fa￾vorable effect for treating NAFLD.
Methods
Data sources and search strategy
We performed a comprehensive search for English and
Chinese language publications on PubMed and China
National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases
through April 20th, 2019. The search terms used were
physical activity, exercise, aerobic exercise, aerobic train￾ing, resistance exercise, resistance training, strength ex￾ercise, strengthening exercise, strength training, NAFLD,
NASH, NAFL, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, non￾alcoholic steatohepatitis, fatty liver, liver steatosis and
hepatic steatosis. The reference lists cited in the selected
articles and published reviews were manually searched
to identify additional studies.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Two reviewers (Shu-Ting Wang and Jing Zheng) inde￾pendently screened the literature selected from the ini￾tial search. Studies were included if they fulfilled the
following inclusion criteria: (1) prospective randomized
controlled trials; (2) population of any age or sex or eth￾nic origin with NAFLD diagnosed based on the standard
guidelines using noninvasive or invasive approaches; (3)
intervention involving any type of physical activity with
any intensity level or duration; (4) comparison with pla￾cebo (sham exercise) or usual care without physical ac￾tivity; (5) outcomes of interest were improvements in
hepatic enzyme level, serum lipid level, glucose metabol￾ism and intra-hepatic lipids content.
The exclusion criteria were: (1) only abstract available;
(2) non-human study; (3) studies enrolled populations
with secondary causes of fatty liver such as alcohol,
hepatitis viruses or medication; (4) studies included pa￾tients with other metabolic issues, like diabetes.
Data extraction and quality assessment
A pre-designed data collection form was used to extract
the following information: first author, year of publication,
country, trial’s design type, number of enrolled popula￾tions, participants’ character, intervention’s character, dur￾ation of follow-up and method for NAFLD diagnosis. If
the articles contained insufficient information, we con￾tacted the authors to obtain the missing details.
The methodological quality of each included study was
assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool in Review
Manager 5.3 (Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen,
Denmark), which includes the following items: randomized
Wang et al. BMC Gastroenterology (2020) 20:66 Page 2 of 12

sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of
participants and personnel; blinding of outcome assess￾ment; incomplete outcome data; selective reporting and
other bias. The studies were classified into risk of low, un￾clear, or high bias risk.
Two reviewers performed all data extraction and qual￾ity assessment independently. If discrepancies occurred,
a consensus result was achieved by discussion.
Statistical analysis
The outcomes in this study are all continuous variables
presented as standardized mean difference (SMD) and
95% confidence intervals (CI). Heterogeneity was evalu￾ated using the Cochran Q statistic and I2 metric. A
random-effect model was used to pool the study data if I2
value > 50% which represented statistical heterogeneity;
otherwise, a fixed-effect model was used. Because it is dif￾ficult to interpret the clinical effect size of SMD [12], we
used the interpretation thresholds proposed by Cohen
et al. who suggested SMDs < 0.2, ≥0.2 and < 0.5, ≥0.5
and < 0.8, ≥0.8 correspond to insignificant, small, moder￾ate and large effect sizes respectively [13]. To investigate
clinical variability, subgroup analyses based on the type
and duration of physical activity was conducted. Sensitiv￾ity analyses were further performed by removing each
study individually to evaluate the stability and reliability of
the results of the primary meta-analysis. When there were
at least 10 studies included in the meta-analysis, publica￾tion bias was detected by Egger’s regression test, with p <
0.05 indicative of significance. All the above statistical ana￾lyses were conducted using R software (Version 3.5.3).
Results
Literature search and study characteristics
Figure 1 shows the details of the literature search and study
selection. Our search strategy initially identified 404 papers.
Duplicate removal and screening through article title and
abstract review identified 28 studies. Nineteen studies were
excluded after the full text was reviewed. Finally, 9 studies
involving 951 participants were included in the meta￾analysis [8, 14–21]. Among them, 2 studies [17, 21] had
more than one intervention groups, therefore each type of
intervention was compared with control group and ana￾lyzed. Table 1 outlines the characteristics of the included
studies. The majority of included studies reported both
male and female NAFLD patients except one involving only
male patients [19]. All studies involved adults NAFLD pa￾tients. The intervention duration ranged from 8 to 48 weeks
and the median was 16 weeks (4 months).
Methodological quality
Figure 2 presents the methodological quality of the in￾cluded studies. Most studies had low risk of bias in ran￾dom sequence generation and all four studies reported
information in allocation concealment had low risk of
selection bias; however, three studies had high risk in
blinding of participants and personnel and only one
study reported the use of blinding in outcome assess￾ment. All studies had low risk of bias in incomplete out￾come data and selective reporting.
Effect of physical activity on hepatic enzyme parameters
Nine, eight and five studies reported data for alanine
aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase
(AST), and γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT) respectively.
The combined results suggested that physical activity
alone can significantly improve all three hepatic enzyme
parameters: ALT (SMD -0.17, 95% CI: − 0.30 to − 0.05),
AST (SMD -0.25, 95% CI: − 0.38, − 0.13) and GGT
(SMD -0.22, 95% CI: − 0.36, − 0.08), and the heterogen￾eity among studies were all insignificant (I2 < 50%). But
the effect size is generally small with marginal confi￾dence interval (Fig. 3).
Compared with no physical activity, subgroup analysis
showed that aerobic exercise alone can significantly reduce
AST (SMD -0.26, 95% CI: − 0.43, − 0.10). Regarding to
ALT and GGT, the effects were insignificant (SMD -0.16,
95% CI: − 0.32 to 0.00 and SMD -0.19, 95% CI: − 0.40 to
0.01 respectively). Resistance exercise alone had similar
small improvement effect on these two hepatic enzyme pa￾rameters: AST (SMD -0.23, 95% CI: − 0.43, − 0.03) and
GGT (SMD -0.24, 95% CI: − 0.44, − 0.03). But regarding to
the combination of aerobic and resistance exercise, results
showed no improvements on all three parameters. Hetero￾geneity between subgroups were insignificant for ALT (p =
0.32), AST (p = 0.11) and GGT (p = 0.88) (Fig. 3).
Further categorizing studies according to the interven￾tion duration, subgroup analysis showed that, regardless
of the type of physical activity, keeping regular physical
activity for more than 4 months can significantly im￾prove hepatic enzyme level, while less than 4 months’
physical activity had no significant effect (Fig. 4).
Effect of physical activity on serum lipid parameters
Eight, seven, seven, and eight studies had sufficient data for
inclusion in meta analyses for total cholesterol (TC), triglyc￾erides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C),
and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), respect￾ively. There was no significant heterogeneity among these
studies for all these four parameters (I2 < 50%). The pooled
result showed that, compared with control group, partici￾pants who had regular physical activities were more likely
to have slightly lower TC (SMD = − 0.22, 95% CI: − 0.34, −
0.09), TG (SMD = − 0.18, 95% CI: − 0.31, − 0.06) and LDL￾C (SMD = − 0.26, 95% CI: − 0.39, − 0.13). Regarding to
HDL-C, physical activity tended to increase the level of it
compared with control, but the effect was insignificant
(SMD = 0.07, 95% CI: − 0.06, 0.19) (Fig. 5). In the subgroup
Wang et al. BMC Gastroenterology (2020) 20:66 Page 3 of 12

analysis, taking resistance exercise alone can significantly
reduce TC but with a small effect size (SMD = − 0.31, 95%
CI: − 0.51, − 0.10), while neither aerobic exercises alone nor
combination of it with resistance exercise can improve TC.
Heterogeneity between subgroups were not significant (p =
0.71). As for TG, only resistance exercise alone can
significantly reduce the level of it, with small effect size
(SMD = − 0.32, 95% CI: − 0.52 to − 0.11). The heterogeneity
between subgroups for TG was significant (p = 0.09). The
subgroup analyses also suggested that aerobic exercises
alone and resistance exercise alone can significantly reduce
the level of LDL-C, with SMD -0.21, 95% CI: − 0.37 to −
0.04 and SMD -0.35, 95% CI: − 0.56 to − 0.15 respectively,
but combination of aerobic and resistance exercise had no
significant effect on LDL-C, which may due to small sample
size as only 1 study was included in this subgroup. The het￾erogeneity between subgroups was insignificant (p = 0.66).
Regarding HDL-C, all three subgroups showed insignificant
results and there was no difference between subgroups
(p = 0.94) (Fig. 5).
As for duration of physical activity, both ≥4 months and
<4 months groups had significant effect on TC regardless
of the type of physical activity (SMD -0.19, 95% CI − 0.32
to − 0.06 and SMD -0.60, 95% CI − 1.10 to − 0.10 respect￾ively). Only ≥4 months intervention significantly improved
TG (SMD -0.16, 95% CI: − 0.30 to − 0.03) and LDL-C
(SMD -0.25, 95% CI: − 0.38 to − 0.12). Regarding HDL-C,
both subgroups showed insignificant effect (Fig. 6).

Effect of physical activity on glucose metabolism
parameters
Seven, four and four studies had sufficient data for
inclusion in analyses of fasting glucose, fasting insulin,
and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance
(HOMA-IR), respectively. The heterogeneity among
studies for these three glucose metabolism parameters
was all significant (I2
>50%). The random-effect model
showed that there was no significant effect of physical
activity on improving these glucose metabolism
parameters.
In the subgroup analysis, compared with control,
only aerobic exercise alone can significantly reduce
HOMA-IR (SMD = − 0.42, 95% CI: − 0.63 to − 0.22).
Heterogeneities between subgroups for HOMA-IR was
significant (p = 0.04). Combination of aerobic exercise
and resistance exercise can improve fasting insulin
(SMD = − 0.80, 95% CI: − 1.59 to − 0.01), but this sub￾group only included 1 study with a small sample size
of 15. As for fasting glucose, all three types of phys￾ical activity had no significant improvement effect
(Fig. 7).
In the subgroup analysis according to duration of
intervention, significant improvement was found in ≥4
months group for fasting glucose (SMD = − 0.27, 95%
CI: − 0.48, − 0.07) and HOMA-IR (SMD = − 0.44, 95%
CI: − 0.60, − 0.29). There were no significant effects in
subgroups for fasting insulin (Fig. 8).
Effect of physical activity on intra-hepatic lipid content
Four studies had sufficient data to be included in the ana￾lysis of effect of physical activity on intra-hepatic lipid
content. The heterogeneity among studies was not signifi￾cant (I2 < 50%). The fixed-effect model showed that phys￾ical activity can significantly reduce NAFLD patient’s liver
fat content (SMD = − 0.21, 95% CI: − 0.36 to − 0.06). In
the subgroup analysis of different intervention types, nei￾ther aerobic exercise nor resistance exercise showed sig￾nificant improvement on intra-hepatic lipid content, but
only one study had an intervention arm of resistance exer￾cise with 153 participants (Fig. 9). Because all four in￾cluded studies had intervention durations longer than 4
months, the effect of physical activity on intra-hepatic
lipid cannot be assessed in subgroup analysis.
Sensitivity analysis and publication bias
Sensitivity analysis was conducted by removing each in￾dividual study, except for fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and
intra-hepatic lipid content where only 4 studies were in￾cluded. The results suggested that the pooled effect were
unlikely to be substantially altered (Fig. 10). As there
were less than 10 included studies, publication bias ana￾lysis was not conducted.
Adverse events
Three studies [16, 20, 21] mentioned adverse events
during the intervention of physical activity. Among

951 participants, there were 2 knee pain, 1 shoulder
pain, 1 back pain and 2 bone fractures which did not
occur during exercise sessions reported. Overall, the
incidence of adverse events was quite low, which sug￾gesting that physical activity intervention was well￾tolerated. However, only a few studies had reported
on adverse events and the duration of trials ranged
from 2 to 13 months. Therefore, the long-term safety
of physical activity intervention needs further studies
to prove.
Discussion
In the present meta-analysis, we attempted to collect less
biased evidence to identify the effect of physical activity
intervention on patients with NAFLD. The included nine
studies suggested that physical activity intervention can
improvehepatic enzyme, most serum lipid and intra￾hepatic lipid content in patients with NAFLD without
diabetes. Although our meta-analysis results showed sta￾tistically significant effect, the magnitude of the improve￾ment by physical activity interventions appears to be

insignificant or small according to Cohen’s interpret￾ation rule of thumb. This differs from previous reviews
reporting that physical activity can significantly improve
hepatic enzyme, serum lipid levels and intra-hepatic lipid
content with a moderate to large pooled effect size [22,
23], but these previous studies included NAFLD patients
with diabetes, so the improvement may partly due to an￾tidiabetic medication or other treatment [23]. Besides,
the pooled result showed physical activity had no signifi￾cantly effect on glucose metabolism which may be also
due to the population in our study was non-diabetic
NAFLD patients.

The mechanism of physical activity intervention benefit￾ing NAFLD patients is still unclear and there is no specific
recommendation for types of physical activity. In the sub￾group analyses of our study, we found compared with
usual care without physical activity, resistance exercise
alone can significantly improve hepatic enzyme and serum
lipid, which is consistent with the results of systematic re￾view by Kenneally et al. [24]. This finding is important for
patients with NAFLD with obesity, for whom resistance
exercise is more appropriate, as some types of aerobic

exercise may result in joint stress or injury. However, our
results suggested combination of aerobic and resistance
exercise was less effective, only providing improvement
for fasting insulin. This is probably due to the small sam￾ple size as the subgroup had only 76 participants in total.
Longer exercise durations generally had better improve￾ment effects, although the difference between subgroups
was not significant. In the sensitivity analysis, results sug￾gested pooled effect on hepatic enzyme and serum lipid
parameters were robust. But the effect of physical activity
on glucose metabolism parameters and intra-hepatic lipid
content needs to be further ascertained by including more
large RCTs, as only 4 studies had sufficient information
on these parameters in our study. To the best of our
knowledge, this study is currently the first systematic re￾view that evaluated the comprehensive effectiveness of
physical activity on hepatic enzyme, serum lipid, glucose
metabolism and intra-hepatic lipid content in western and

Chinese NAFLD patients without T2DM. The study
population was restricted to subjects with NAFLD without
T2DM.Although matching with an adequate control
population can reduce the bias to some extents, the lack
of information in anti-diabetic drug use of participants
could still be a problem, considering different anti￾diabetic medications have different effects on NAFLD
[25]. We also excluded other factors that may have af￾fected the meta-analysis results, such as diet adjustment
or lipid-lowering medication.
Our study has several limitations. First, several of the
included studies did not describe the intensity of the
physical activity interventions clearly, therefore we could
not perform subgroup analysis categorized by intensity,
which may possibly influence the effect of the physical
activity. Second, subgroup analysis according to different
NAFLD diagnostic methods was inapplicable because
Shojaee-Moradie et al. [19] used more than one diagnos￾tic method for the confirmation of NAFLD. However,
differences in the sensitivity and specificity of the differ￾ent diagnostic methods could result in clinical hetero￾geneity. Biochemical tests have low specificity, and
ultrasound is less accurate for patients with mild steato￾sis. The sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
for diagnosing hepatic steatosis is slightly higher than
that of ultrasound. Nevertheless, all imaging examina￾tions cannot detect the degree of liver inflammation and
necrosis. Only liver biopsy can identify NAFL and NASH
[26], among the non-invasive methods, 1
H-MRS (MR
spectroscopy) is the most accurate [27, 28]. Thirdly,
there is a lack of information for histological improve￾ment in the analyzed RCTs, which has been reported in
Fig. 9 Subgroup analysis of the effect of physical activity intervention types on intra-hepatic lipid content

several studies. Vilar-Gomez et al. conducted a RCT of
293 patients with histologically proven NASH and found
degree of weight loss after a 52-week of diet was inde￾pendently associated with improvements in all NASH￾related histologic parameters (odds ratios = 1.1–2.0; P <
0.01, [29]). Another study also reported significant
improvements in liver histology in NASH led by weight
reduction achieved through 48 weeks lifestyle interven￾tion including diet, exercise, and behavior modification
among 31 overweight or obese individuals with biopsy￾proven NASH [30]. Apart from that, the differing profes￾sional levels and clinical skills of the researchers in the
included studies may also have affected the reported
outcomes. In addition, among the included studies, the
longest intervention duration was 48 weeks, therefore we
could not determine the long-term benefit of physical
activity. Another drawback is that although we searched
the published studies thoroughly, we cannot rule out the
possibility of missing unpublished studies with null ef￾fects, and we only included studies published in English
and Chinese in this meta-analysis, which may explain
the significant publication bias found for ALT.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our meta-analysis suggests that regular
physical activity, whether aerobic or resistance exercise
alone, can improve hepatic enzyme, most serum lipid
and intra-hepatic lipid in non-diabetic patients with
NAFLD, but the effect size is generally small. Therefore,
the expectation of great improvement in NAFLD from
physical activity alone needs to be tempered with cau￾tion. Furthermore, future large-scale prospective RCTs
are needed to determine the histological improvements,
long-term benefits and safety of physical activity.
