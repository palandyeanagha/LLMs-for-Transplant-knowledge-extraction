SUMMARY

We report the clinical findings and evolution of seven patients (five men and two women), the
majority of them intravenous drug users, with paracoccidioidomycosis associated to acquired

immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

In four of the patients the paracoccidioidomycosis was restricted to the lung and in the three others
was generalized with cutaneous involvement. Only two of them had lived recently in rural area, an
indication of the possible reactivation of latent focal infection in the other five patients.

The recognition of the role of cell-mediated immunity in host defense against Paracoccidioides
brasiliensis \eds to the prediction of a growing occurrence of the paracoccidioidomycosis-AIDS
association in areas that are endemic for these diseases.

KEYWORDS: . AIDS; Epidemiology; P. brasiliensis; Paracoccidioidomycosis.

INTRODUCTION

Paracoccidioidomycosis is a deep mycoses
endemic in several countries in Latin America,
especially in Brazil '°. As occurs with other deep
mycoses, patients are infected by inhaling mycelia or
conidia of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, with the
instalation of a primary pulmonary complex * '*. In
most persons, the natural defense mechanisms can
either eliminate the agent or establish an equilibrium
between host and agent. In the latter case, the fungi
would continue to be viable in the form of latent foci
of infection °. In a minority, however, the disease
progress from this primary pulmonary focus.

Since cell-mediated immunity is the basic defense

mechanism against P. brasiliensis °-'*, a dysfunction of
this system induced by immunosuppressive factors
such as chemotherapy, corticotherapy or infection with
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may result in
paracoccidioidomycosis-diseases from the reactivation
of the quiescent foci '''’?°, In Brazil, the association
between paracoccidioidomycosis and acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is particularly
important ** % 'S because of the progressive
dissemination of HIV to small and medium urban
centers, especially in the Center-South region of the
country *, an area of high prevalence of infection with
P. brasiliensis '\"*. In order to emphasize the growing
occurrence of this association, we report 7 cases
diagnosed at three different hospitals in the state of Sao
Paulo.

CASE REPORTS

Case 1

A 19-year old female using intravenous drugs,
heterosexually involved with multiple partners and
with positive anti-HIV serology detected by ELISA,
sought the University Hospital of the Faculty of
Medicine of Marilia (UH-FMM) with a pulmonary
complaint characterized by coughing and bronchial
secretion. Radiologic investigation revealed a diffuse
reticular interstitial pulmonary infiltrate and
examination of sputum permitted the identification of
P. brasiliensis. There was no evidence of infection of
other organs or systems.

Treatment with cotrimoxazole was started, with
satisfactory results. During follow-up, the patient
showed marked weight loss, diarrhea caused by
Isospora belli, chronic genital mucocutaneous herpes
simplex, oral candidiasis, and died 5 months
afterwards.

Case 2

A 46-year old female patient using intravenous
drugs, heterosexually involved with multiple partners
and with positive anti-HIV serology detected by
ELISA, sought the UH-FMM with pulmonary
complaints. A chest X-ray showed an interstitial
infiltrate in the base of the right lung. Examination of
sputum revealed the presence of P. brasiliensis.
Treatment with cotrimoxazole led to clinical improve-
ment. During follow-up, the patient presented oral
candidiasis, enterorrhagia and encephalitis of indeter-
minate etiology and died 2 months after the diagnosis
of paracoccidioidomycosis.

Case 3

A 28-year old male patient sought the UH-FMM
with countless ulcerated skin lesions, cervical, axillary
and inguinal adenomegaly and intense weight loss
(Fig. 1). A diagnosis of paracoccidioidomycosis was
confirmed by the detection of P. brasiliensis in histopa-
thological examination of a skin biopsy. There was no
apparent involvement of oral mucosa or lungs.

In view of the sexual behavior of the patient and
of the clinical characteristics of paracoccidioidomyco-
sis, anti-HIV serology was investigated and found to be
positive (ELISA).

The patient was treated with amphotericin B
(acumulative dose of 2000 mg), with full regression of

signs and symptoms. However, after 5 months, the
clinical picture deteriored by presumable toxoplasmo-
sis of the central nervous system, diagnosed by tomo-
graphy and the patient died of S. aureus-induced
septicemia. At this time the paracoccidioidomycosis
appeared to be clinically inactive.

Case 4

A 31-year old male patient, heterosexually
involved with multiple partners, was seen at the UH-
FMM with pulmonary complaints. A chest X-ray
revealed a macronodular infiltrate in the upper fields of
both lungs. A presumptive diagnosis of tuberculosis
was made, but examination of sputum revealed the
presence of P. brasiliensis. There was no evidence of
paracoccidioidomycosis in other organs. Serologic
anti-HIV investigation was positive (ELISA) and com-
plement-fixation and precipitation anti-P. brasiliensis
reactions were negative. Treatment with cotrimoxazole
was started but the patient did not return for follow-up.

Case 5

A 28-year old male from the rural area, a drug user
heterosexually involved with multiple partners and
with HIV-positive serology (ELISA), sought the

Regional Hospital of Sorocaba with pulmonary and
constitutional complaints. Oral candidiasis and bila-
teral interstitial pneumonia suggestive of Pneumocystis
carinii were diagnosed. Treatment with a combination
of cotrimoxazole and ketoconazole was started with
improvement. One month later he returned with skin
lesions on the face, limbs and oral mucosa.
Histopathological examination led to a diagnosis of
paracoccidioidomycosis. He continued treatment with
400 mg/day ketoconazole with no resolution of the
signs and symptoms, which was only obtained after the
introduction of amphotericin B (cumulative dose of
1000 mg). The anti-P. brasiliensis serology performed
before the amphotericin B was positive with a low titer
in the complement-fixation reaction, and negative in
the counterimmunoelectrophoresis reaction. Eight
months after the diagnosis of paracoccidioidomycosis
he developed an infectious pulmonary syndrome of
indeterminate etiology and died.

Case 6

A 25-year old male from the rural area, a user of
intravenous drugs heterosexually involved with
multiple partners, sought the Regional Hospital of
Sorocaba with a 3-month history of fever, diarrhea,
weight loss and pulmonary complaints. His chest X-ray
showed a diffuse interstitial and micronodular
pulmonary infiltrate and he presented oral candidiasis
and positive anti-HIV serology (ELISA). After one
month of follow-up, P. brasiliensis was identified in
sputum. Treatment with cotrimoxazole in combination
with amphotericin B on the 12th day (cumulative dose
of 837 mg) was instituted, with improvement. Three
months later he developed signs and symptoms of
meningoencephalitis due to Cryptococcus neoformans
and a relapse of the pulmonary syndrome. He was
treated with a total dose of 900 mg of amphotericin B,
with clear clinical improvement. The patient suffered a
relapse of neurologic and pulmonary symptoms 4
months later, when he was treated again with ampho-
tericin B and cotrimoxazole, with improvement.

Case 7

A 42-year old male patient involved in homo-
sexual practice was seen at the University Hospital of
the Faculty of Medicine of Botucatu, with complaints
of cervical adenomegaly of 3 months duration,
ulcerated skin lesions and fever, with a recent 12 kg
weight loss within this time. Examination revealed
cervical, axillary and inguinal adenomegaly of up to 4
cm, with no inflammatory signs; multiple ulcerated

skin lesions up to 3 cm located on the face, trunk and
limbs; and hepatomegaly. Laboratory tests showed:
positive anti-HIV tests (ELISA and Western blot);
5200 leucocytes; 1631 lymphocytes; Hb = 10.1 g%; Ht
= 33.0%; CD4 = 67 cells/mm3, CD8 = 929 cells/mm3;
and 3.7 g% hypergammaglobulinemia. Urea,
creatinine, OGT, PGT, alkaline phosphatase, AgHbs,
anti-Hbs, chest X ray, paracoccidioidin test, complement
fixation reaction, precipitins, anti-P. brasiliensis
immunodiffusion and immunofluorescence were
normal or negative.

The diagnosis was confirmed by the detection of
minute P. brasiliensis forms upon histopathological
examination of skin lesions (Fig. 2). A positive reaction
against antigenic P. brasiliensis components with
molecular weights of 71, 61, 51,43 and 27 kDa was
detected by Western blot.

The patient was treated with 400 mg/day
ketoconazole for 5 months and with cotrimoxazole
after the 6th month, in combination with
azidothymidine, with apparent clinical cure of
paracoccidioidomycosis, weight gain, correction of
anemia and stabilization of CD4 cells at about 55 cells/
mm3. Fourteen months later, the patient presented a
pulmonary infection of rapid course and died. Autopsy
showed a generalized infection by Cryptococcus
neoformans, with no evidence of residual P.
brasiliensis infection.

awareness of the role of cell-mediate immunity in the
mechanisms of host defense against P. brasiliensis
permitted us to predict that HIV infection and the
consequent occurrence of AIDS would cause a growing
prevalence of the paracoccidioidomycosis-AIDS
association in areas that are endemic for both diseases.

Although several laboratory tests, especially those
related to immunologic profile and anti-P. brasiliensis
serology, could not be obtained for the cases reported
here, we believe that these reports are justified by the
clinical characteristics and the course of the patients
and by their epidemiologic importance. In this series
(see table 1), mean patient age (29 years) was lower
than that observed in isolated paracoccidioidomycosis
and was consistent with that observed in AIDS, as also
was the proportion of females. The predominance of
use of intravenous drugs as a risk factor for HIV
infection reflects the current epidemiologic profile of
AIDS in the state of Sao Paulo. A relevant fact is that
in 5 of these cases paracoccidioidomycosis was the first
disease diagnosed or even the disease that induced the
investigation of HIV infection. In 4 patients,
paracoccidioidomycosis was apparently limited to the
lungs with uncommon presentation in two of them, but
in the remaining 3 it was generalized, with particular
involvement of the monocyte-macrophage system and
with multiple skin lesions characteristic of the acute-
subacute forms of the clinical classification of
paracoccidioidomycosis’. In the cases submitted to
histopathological study, we detected an eminently
exudative inflammatory response, loose granulomas
and exuberance of fungal cells demonstrating the
inefficient cell immune response. The therapeutic
results may be considered effective for most patients,
with emphasis on the need to introduce amphotericin B
in two cases in order to obtain clinical resolution.

Epidemiologically, five of the patients were not
involved in rural activities at the time of diagnosis, a
fact suggesting the reactivation of quiescent foci of P.
brasiliensis infection. Only one patient showed CD4
cell counts at diagnosis (67 cells/mm’). Since few
reports of this kind are available in the literature, the
extent of HIV-induced immunosuppression necessary
for, or contributing to, the manifestation of paracocci-
dioidomycosis as a disease still needs to be clarified.
Finally, we emphasize that the number of cases of
paracoccidioidomycosis-AIDS association may be less
expressive than the histoplasmosis-AIDS association
because of the generalized use of anti-P. carinii
chemoprophylaxis with cotrimoxazole, a drug known
to be effective against P. brasiliensis.

RESUMO

Paracoccidioidomicose associada 4 Sindrome da
Imunodeficiéncia Adquirida. Relato de Sete Casos.

Sao apresentadas as caracteristicas clinicas e
evolutivas de sete pacientes (cinco masculinos e dois
do sexo feminino), a maioria dos quais usuarios de
drogas ilicitas endovenosa, com paracoccidioidomi-
cose associada a Sindrome da Imunodeficiéncia
Adquirida (SIDA/AIDS). Em quatro pacientes a
paracoccidioidomicose comprometia os pulmdes
isoladamente, nos demais a doenga era generalizada
com envolvimento cuténeo. Apenas dois pacientes
eram procedentes recentes da zona rural. O que nos faz
presumir que nos demais a paracoccidioidomicose
doenga resultou da reativagdo de focos latentes da
infecgao. Dado o papel da imunidade medida por
células na defesa do hospedeiro contra o
Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, é de se prever crescente
ocorréncia da associagao paracoccidioidomicose -
SIDA/AIDS nas areas endémicas para ambas as
enfermidades.
