Abstract
Along elevational gradients, climate warming may lead to an upslope shift of the lower and upper range margin of
organisms. A recent meta-analysis concluded that these shifts are species specific and considerably differ among taxonomic
lineages. We used the opportunity to compare upper range margins of five lineages (plants, beetles, flies, hymenoptera, and
birds) between 1902–1904 and 2006–2007 within one region (Bavarian Forest, Central Europe). Based on the increase in the
regional mean annual temperature during this period and the regional lapse rate, the upslope shift is expected to be
between 51 and 201 m. Averaged across species within lineages, the range margin of all animal lineages shifted upslope,
but that of plants did not. For animals, the observed shifts were probably due to shifts in temperature and not to changes in
habitat conditions. The range margin of plants is therefore apparently not constrained by temperature, a result contrasting
recent findings. The mean shift of birds (165 m) was within the predicted range and consistent with a recent global meta￾analysis. However, the upslope shift of the three insect lineages (.260 m) exceeded the expected shift even after
considering several sources of uncertainty, which indicated a non-linear response to temperature. Our analysis
demonstrated broad differences among lineages in their response to climate change even within one region. Furthermore,
on the considered scale, the response of ectothermic animals was not consistent with expectations based on shifts in the
mean annual temperature. Irrespective of the reasons for the overshooting of the response of the insects, these shifts lead
to reorganizations in the composition of assemblages with consequences for ecosystem processes.

Introduction
A plethora of studies have demonstrated recent shifts in the
distribution of species in many marine, freshwater and terrestrial
organisms [1]. Most of these shifts can be attributed to global
warming [2,3]. However, the variability of the response of species
or groups of phylogenetically related species (lineages) to global
warming is considerable [3]. Furthermore, the processes under￾lying the differences within and among lineages are not well
understood, which hampers the transfer of results from one lineage
to another as well as predictions of the effects of climate change on
assemblages of species [3]. Two hypotheses may explain this
variability among species, lineages and studies. First, species and
also lineages differ in their physiological characteristics as well as
traits that mediate their interaction with the environment leading
to the observed differences in their response to climate change [4].
Second, the response differs among regions (e.g. because of biotic
interactions that vary among assemblages differing in species
composition) as well as among spatial scales (e.g. because different
processes associated with climate change operate across different
spatial scales). Most comparative studies, however, have to
combine results from lineages investigated in different regions
and/or on different geographic scales [1]. To distinguish between
these two explanations, one has to compare results among species
or lineages within one region. However, the availability of such
data is rather limited; but see [5].
We took advantage of an opportunity to compare information
from 1902–1904 and 2006–2007 on the distribution of plants,
insects and birds along an elevational gradient within the low￾range mountain massif of the Bavarian Forest in south-eastern
Germany. Mountains are important study objects in climate
change research [6]. In contrast to latitudinal studies, species are
able to respond more readily to a changing climate due to the
short distances along the local gradients [7,8]. As fingerprints of
climate change, contractions on the lower range margins [9], shifts
of the species optimum [7] and upslope shifts of the upper range
margins [10,11] have been shown. Despite the short distances
along elevational gradients, however, the observed response of
species to global warming along these gradients often lag behind
the response predicted from temperature shifts [2]. Furthermore,
this lagging behind is not consistent across lineages [2]. The aim of
our study, was to compare the average upper elevational range
margins of five lineages in one region with a quantitative
expectation based on climate data that were in contrast to many
published studies, collected in the study area, and thereby to
answer (1) whether the upper elevational range margin of each
lineage in the investigated area shifts; (2) whether these shifts are
consistent among lineages; and (3) whether these shifts are
consistent with temperature shifts or lag behind.

Materials and Methods
Study area
The Bavarian Forest National Park (48u559N, 13u289E) lies
within the largest low-range mountain forest in Central Europe,
the mountain massif of the Bavarian Forest, and covers
approximately 24,000 ha. It is characterized by a mountain slope
increasing from south-west to north-east, which leads to a
predominantly south-west exposure [12]. Elevation ranges from
650 to 1,450 m a.s.l., and Mt. Rachel is the highest mountain of
the park. The high montane forest (.1,150 m) is dominated by
Norway Spruce (Picea abies), with only a low proportion of
European Beech (Fagus sylvatica) and Mountain Ash (Sorbus
aucuparia); below this elevation, the mixed montane forest is
dominated by spruce, beech, and Silver Fir (Abies alba). The
temperature increased during the 20th century (Fig. 1a; r2= 0.19,
p,0.001). The average temperature of the 20 years (1886–1905)
around our first study period (1902–1904) was 5.1uC, whereas the
average of the 20 years (1991–2010) around our second study
period (2006–2007) was 6.2uC. Although the annual precipitation
increased from 1,196 to 1,352 mm between 1886 and 2010 in the
study region, the precipitation over time was more erratic (Fig. 1b;
r
2= 0.036, p,0.05).
Species data
From 1902 to 1904, Thiem [13] sampled several lineages of
organisms along the elevational gradient of Mt. Rachel to
determine their distribution and reported their upper elevational
range margin. In 2006 and 2007, we surveyed two transects along
Mt. Rachel similar to those of Thiem [13] as well as two transects
approximately 10 km distant from Mt. Rachel in the northern part
of the national park (Mt. Lackenberg). The exposure and slope of
the localities of the two surveys are therefore similar. In both
surveys, taxonomical experts participated in the determination of
species. We harmonized the species lists with respect to synonymy
and the splitting up of species. We restricted our comparison to
lineages sharing at least 50 taxonomically uncritical species
between the two time periods. Given this criterion, we analysed
five lineages: Spermatophyta, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera (only
Symphyta, Aculeata and Formicidae), Diptera (only Syrphidae)
and Aves (Table 1, see also Table S1). Our own survey was carried
out on fixed plots: 286 plots for Spermatophyta (relevees) and Aves
(breeding birds, grid mapping), 182 plots for Coleoptera (window
and pitfall traps, direct search), and 36 plots for Syrphidae and
Hymenoptera (malaise traps); for methods, see [12]. All necessary
permits for our field study were obtained from the local authorities
(District Niederbayern).
Statistical analysis
Mean annual temperature data since 1886 are available for the
study region (Fig. 1). To derive an expectation for the upslope
shift, we multiplied the linear lapse rate (linear decrease of
temperature along elevation) of the study area (0.0059uC m21
),
which has been shown to be robust across space and time [14],
with the difference in mean annual temperature between the two
survey periods. However, climatic events affect populations with a
certain time lag [15]. This time lag depends on, e.g. the life span of
a species (from weeks in insects to many years for some birds or
plants) or the age reached at the time of the first reproduction [16].
We therefore calculated differences using an increasing number of
years. We first calculated the difference in the mean annual
temperature between 1903 and 2006 and added step-by-step one
additional year for both the historical and the recent time series
(e.g. calculating in the second step the difference between the
average annual temperatures of 1901–1902 and 2005–2006) until
we calculated the differences of average temperatures across 18
years (i.e. the difference between the average temperature of
1886–1903 and 1989–2006). This limit was set by the availability
of data for the region (first available annual temperature record in
1886; see above and Fig. 1). Finally, we calculated the expected
shifts by multiplying the differences obtained by this procedure
with the lapse rate (see above). When we compared only 1903 and
2006, the expected shift was 51 m; when we used the difference of
annual mean temperatures averaged across 18 years, the expected
shift increased to 201 m (Fig. 1c). These two estimates were used
as a conservative estimate for the interval in which the
distributional shift should fall. Additional estimates based on lapse
rates calculated for various seasons (e.g. the lapse rate is larger
during the growing season) showed that these expected shifts also
fell within the range of 51–201 m. We are aware that extreme
temperatures might be more important for the biogeography of a
species than mean temperature [17]. However, at present, we have
no reliable data for considering such events [18].
We used the ecdf function (empirical cumulative distribution
function) in R 2.15.0 [19], starting from the upper elevational end
of the mountain to estimate the relative number of species
occurring above a specific elevation [20] and using only the species
shared by both surveys (Table 1). The empirical cumulative
distribution function is a step function with i/n jumps at
observation values, where i is the number of common observations

at that elevation and n is the number of species. We tested
differences between periods for each of the five lineages using the
Kolmogorow-Smirnow test.
We relied on the data reported by Thiem [13], which are based
on the uppermost elevation record of each species. Such data
depend heavily on both the sampling effort and the population size
of a species, which might fluctuate considerably over years.
However, we have no information on the sampling effort of the
survey of Thiem [13] to allow comparison with that of our survey.
Therefore, the estimates of the range shifts of single species are
unreliable, and we decided to restrict ourselves on broad
comparisons of the mean shift among lineages. Nevertheless, even
such averages might depend on the sampling effort (see also
Table 1). We therefore used three methods to estimate the possible
effects of uneven sampling effort [21]. (1) During the recent survey,
we recorded more species of beetles and flies than listed by Thiem
[13], which indicated that our survey was more intensive [22]. We
therefore recalculated the cumulative distribution of beetles (the
lineages with the highest number of species; Table 1) considering
only species with at least 5, 10 and 15 individuals (Fig. 2a); thus, we
used only well-sampled species for our comparisons. (2) We
calculated estimates of the mean shift of the upper elevational
range margin, reducing the number of sampling plots in our data
sets to assess the sensitivity of the difference between the two
surveys to the sampling intensity of the recent survey (Fig. S1). (3)
To calculate the mean shift of species within lineages, we
compared the averages across all species to averages excluding
species recorded only on one plot (Table 1).
Results
The cumulative distribution of the upper elevational range
margin for the two sampling periods 1902–1904 and 2006–2007
(Table 1) suggested that the elevation of the upper range margins
of all five lineages differed between the two sampling periods
(Fig. 2a): the mean upper range margin of plants decreased,
whereas that of all animals increased. However, the apparent shift
depended on the abundance and occupancy of species (Fig. 2b,
Table 1). Although we have such detailed data for the second
period only, a plot of the apparent range shift versus the frequency
of plots with records of that species showed that the variability of
the apparent shift decreases with the frequency (Fig. 2b).
Nevertheless, abundant plant species showed on average a
downslope shift, whereas abundant animal species showed an
upslope shift (Fig. 2b; see also Table 1).
The apparent mean shift of the upper range margin of vascular
plants was approximately 275 m, irrespective of the commonness
of species (Fig. 2b). Thiem [13] used a correction factor to
compare data of plants from different exposures. For animals, he
reported no such factor. The main exposure of the plots of our
recent survey was south-west, for which Thiem [13] used a
correction factor of +70 m. This correction factor explains the
difference between the two surveys; we therefore conclude that the
upper range margins did not shift during the 20th century. Overall,
these analyses clearly showed shifts in the distribution of only
animal species between the two periods.
The upslope shift of birds and insects differed considerably
(Fig. 3, Table 1). The quantitative shift of the birds was as expected
from the change in the mean annual temperature, but the upslope
shift of all three lineages of insects clearly overshot this expectation
(Fig. 3). The recalculation of the cumulative distribution of beetles
considering only species with at least 5, 10 and 15 individuals
changed this pattern only marginally (Fig. 2a). We reached to the
same conclusion when we calculated the means after excluding
species recorded only on one plot during our surveys (Table 1).
Furthermore, when we reduced the number of sampling plots of
the recent survey stepwise (Fig. S1), or when we concentrated on
the second-highest record of each species (not shown), the
differences and therefore the overshooting phenomena of the
insects remained a robust outcome of our analyses. We conclude
that the changes in the distributional shifts of insects and birds
differed. Furthermore, only for birds was the shift within the
expectation based on the temperature shift; for insects, this
expectation was overshot.
Discussion
Compared to other historical data, the survey of Thiem [13] is
to our knowledge one of the most comprehensive studies
documenting species distributions along an elevational gradient
at that time. The data are of exceptional quality due to both the
high standard of taxonomical knowledge in Central Europe and
the participation of leading experts. Nevertheless, we had to
consider various aspects common to all studies dealing with
historical data.
A main assumption of our analysis is that the distribution of
species in the region is temperature limited. This assumption is
reasonable because we previously found that the composition of
assemblages of numerous lineages depends on temperature
[23,24]. Furthermore, that in animals the documented shifts are

probably a response to climate warming is supported by our
analyses of traits of beetles. We found, consistent with the ‘thermal
melanism hypothesis’ [25], a decrease in melanism in beetle
assemblages with elevation between the two periods (Fig. S2).
In many studies, it is difficult to disentangle effects of climate
change from effects of changes in land use or habitats [5,26].
Clearly, land use by humans also influenced the Inner Bavarian
Forest. However, the Bavarian Forest was colonized by humans
relatively late during the 17th century. Although timber was used
in the following century for glass production, the structure of the
forests changed only little from the pristine conditions. Further￾more, tree species composition of the forests was mainly triggered
by natural processes and events [27]. The similar structure and
composition of the two periods is particularly evident from
photographs taken along the slopes of Mt. Rachel (Fig. S3).
Probably because of climatic reasons [28], the forests near the
summit of Mount Rachel during the first survey were as open as
during our survey (Fig. S3). Furthermore, ca. 30 years before the
survey of Thiem [13], the high montane spruce forest in the study
area was affected by windthrow and subsequent bark beetle
infestation. Dead wood was therefore abundant, as it is now
[12,29]. A final argument that habitat conditions had little
influence on our broad comparisons comes from a comparison
of our two transects on Mt. Rachel with the transects on Mt.
Lackenberg. The latter transects are in an area with a denser
canopy. However, we found no difference in the mean upper
range margins among lineages (data not shown).
Most studies documenting distributional changes fail to make a
priori predictions of the magnitude of the expected effect; but see
[3]. Our analysis demonstrated that such expectations are
associated with large error margins that depend on the time
window used to calculate the difference between the mean annual
temperatures of the two periods [2]. Nevertheless, despite this
broad error margin of the expected response, the upslope shift of
ectothermic insects exceeds the expected shift. In contrast, the
upslope shift of birds matches the expectation calculated from the

relation to frequency. (a) Comparison of the percentage of species occurring above a specific elevation in the two surveys in the low-range
mountain forests of the Bavarian Forest National Park. To generate these plots, we used the empirical cumulative distribution function (for details, see
Statistical methods) from 1902–1904 (blue) and 2006–2007 (red) and included only species that were recorded in both surveys. The stair-step pattern
is a consequence of sampling discrete sites on the gradient. Note that the highest points sampled in each survey differ somewhat. p-values and the
maximum distance (D) arising from a Kolmogorov Smirnov test are given. For Coleoptera, we recalculated the curves for species with at least 5, 10
and 50 individuals (grey lines). (b) Shift of the upper range margin between the surveys of 1902–1904 and 2006–2007 in relation to the number of

information on the regional climate. Furthermore, the observed
upslope shift of birds is also consistent with a recent meta-analysis,
whereas our observed shift of insects was much larger than
expected from this meta-analysis [3]. Nevertheless, the response of
species or lineages to climate change is difficult to predict if only
the mean annual temperature is considered - extreme tempera￾tures are more important than averages [17]. One final critical
point is that we were only able to analyse two distinct time steps.
We have no information about when exactly shifts in the upper
range margins took place. Temperature varied considerably over
time, and the major increase in temperature occurred during the
last 20 years [30].
Despite the various caveats of sampling and other possible
sources of errors, the careful interpretation of the available
information of our study suggested that insects overshot the
expected response to climate warming and plants did not respond.
Generally, it is noteworthy that a lack of response or even a
downward range shift does not necessarily mean that climate
change has no effect. A recent study has suggested that downslope
range shifts of species may constitute an indirect biotic response to
both climate warming and habitat modification [31]. However,
the reason for the plants’ lack of response in the timeframes
compared in our study became clear after a more detailed
inspection of our data: the plants had reached higher elevations
than insects and birds already at the beginning of the 20th century
(Fig. 2). The stability of the range margin of plants suggests that in
contrast to animals factors other than temperature drive the
elevational range margins in the region considered. This is also
supported by our analysis of traits in which we found that the
composition of plant assemblages based on Ellenberg indicator
values did not change with altitude (Fig. S2).
The assemblages of plants on the mountain top above
approximately 1,150 m a.s.l. (Calamagrostis villosae-Fagetum
and -Piceetum) are characterized by a high abundance of species
of the genus Calamagrostis [32]. Experimental evidence shows that
the dominant grasses decrease the rate of establishment of other
species [33]. Another genus that can also be dominant at this
elevation zone is Vaccinium. For species of this long-lived genus,
changes in the distribution owing to climate change can take
decades [34]. Therefore, species of the genera Calamagrostis and
Vaccinium form an effective barrier and might thus hamper the
establishment of new plant species shifting uphill in response to
climate change. This hypothesis has already been discussed for
subalpine grasslands, where the response of plants to climate
change is also weak [9]. From these findings, we can envisage that
the upper range margin of most plant species in 1900 was already
located in a zone in which shifting is strongly hindered by
competition of perennial shrubs and grass species (most probably
by root competition) [35]. This ecological situation contrasts that
of the subnival/nival zone on alpine summits, where species
distribution and numbers change with climate change [11,36].
A second biome-specific explanation for the lack of the plant
species response may also be that the plant assemblages of our
study area on acidic soils are poor in specialists at lower and mid
elevations [37]. Therefore, at lower elevations, where more signals
have to be expected owing to the reduced number of perennial
plants, few species show an upper distribution limit. A last
argument we have to consider is the scale. In contrast to
investigations of summit plant shifts conducted on the scale of
meters [38], we had only coarse historical data. This leads to a
masking of small-scale effects [39].
The most exciting result of our study was the considerable and
robust difference in the upslope shift between birds and insects.
The results for insects contrasted recent findings that the response
of species along elevational gradients lags behind the expectation
[3]. There are two possible explanations for this difference. First, a
lag in the response is expected if suitable new conditions at higher
elevations occur only in locations that cannot be reached (for
example, on other mountain peaks) [3]. In our case, the spatial
distance between sampling plots was maximally 10 km. Dispersal
distances of insects are several kilometres per year [40,41] and
dispersal distances of plants, at least for anemochorous ones, are
estimated to be in a similar range [42], which suggest that in our
region, species may have reached equilibrium. Second, lags may
reflect the topographic complexity of mountainous terrains leading
to microclimatic mosaics with very different conditions [43].
However, this might be more relevant in alpine systems, where the
topography is more complicated than along low-range mountain
systems.
The question remains why birds and insects dramatically
differed in their response to climate warming. One reason might
be that insects react to different climatic variables (e.g. temper￾ature during summer) than birds (e.g. temperature during spring;
54% of the bird species recorded in our area are migratory).
Another possibility is based on the metabolic theory. According to
this theory, temperature non-linearly affects the rates and times of
ecological processes [44]. The body temperature of ectotherms
depends on air temperature; therefore, ectotherms react non￾linearly to changes in temperature. However, the use of lapse rates
implies a linear response. In principle, it should be possible to use
high-frequency temperature data of global change to predict the
response of insects along elevational gradients [45]. However, our
lack of knowledge of the coupling of macrophysiologial processes
and processes relevant for the spatial ecology of species make such
predictions difficult, although not impossible [2].
Irrespective of the reasons behind the differences in the range
shift of organisms, our results showed that lineages within a region
respond differently to climate change. In contrast, a meta-analysis
of data from around the globe has suggested that most variability
of the response is within lineages and not among lineages.
Generalizations from a broad analysis obviously lead to biased
results when applied to a specific region. At a minimum, our
results demonstrated that the level of sensitivity to global warming
differs considerably among lineages. These lineages often trigger
different processes in the local assemblages and communities.
Climate change therefore leads not only to reorganizations in the
composition of assemblages but probably also to changes in
ecosystem processes.
