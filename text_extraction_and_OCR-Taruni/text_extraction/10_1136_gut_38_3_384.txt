Importance of antineutrophil cytoplasmic
antibodies in primary sclerosing cholangitis and
ulcerative colitis: prevalence, titre, and IgG subclass
D S Bansi, K A Fleming, R W Chapman
Abstract
Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies
(ANCA) have been reported in up to 87% of
patients with primary sclerosing cholangi￾tis with or without ulcerative colitis
(PSC+I/-UC) and in 68% of those with UC
only. Compared with other liver and diar￾rhoeal diseases, ANCA have high speci￾ficity for PSC (+1-UC) and UC only. This
study aimed to determine the prevalence
and significance ofANCA in these two dis￾eases and whether the ANCA titre or IgG
subclass, or both, could distinguish
between PSC+UC and UC only. Subjects
included 63 patients with PSC, 85 with UC,
17 with coeliac disease, and 10 with
dermatitis herpeteformis and 36 normal
subjects. ANCA was detected using the
immunoalkaline phosphatase method. The
IgG subclass of ANCA was determined in
27 PSC+UC and 30 UC only patients using
a panel of mouse monoclonal antibodies
specific for the IgG subclasses. At a serum
dilution of 1:5, ANCA had a diagnostic sen￾sitivity of 65% for all PSC and 450/o for UC
only. For PSC+UC the sensitivity was 700/o
at 1:5 (p=0.004 v UC only). At 1:50, the sen￾sitivity values were 54%/o and 25% respec￾tively for PSC+UC and UC only
(p=0.0006). In PSC, ANCA positivity was
significantly associated with extensive
involvement ofthe biliary tree but not with
other clinical parameters. In UC only, the
median disease duration was significantly
greater in ANCA positive patients. The
PSC+UC ANCA showed increased IgG3
compared with UC only ANCA (p<0.05),
together with increased IgG2 and IgG4
(p=NS). ANCA is a diagnostic marker in
PSC and UC. While the higher titres and
different IgG subclass distribution of
ANCA in PSC+UC patients compared
with those with UC only may reflect dif￾ferences in underlying immune regulation,
determination of the ANCA titre and IgG
subclass is unlikely to have a role in distin￾guishing between PSC+UC and UC only
ANCA. Future identification of the anti￾gen(s) for ANCA should allow the develop￾ment of a more sensitive and specific test
for the diagnosis of these two conditions
and also determine if ANCA is associated
with UC or PSC.

Keywords: primary sclerosing cholangitis, ulcerative
colitis, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, IgG
subclass.
Perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic anti￾bodies (ANCA) have been detected in the
serum of 26-85% of patients with primary
sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) with or without
ulcerative colitis (PSC+/-UC) and up to 68%
with UC only. This difference in reported
prevalence probably results from the different
techniques used to detect the antibody, which
include fixed neutrophil ELISA plus immuno￾fluorescence,l 2 immunofluorescence alone,3
and immunoalkaline phosphatase determina￾tion.4 However, it may also reflect differences
between these ethnic groups. Nevertheless,
ANCA is a useful marker of disease in PSC
and UC.
The close association between PSC and
UC5 and the high degree of specificity of
ANCA for PSC and UC compared with other
liver and diarrhoeal diseases respectivelyl 3 4 6
is interesting and suggests there may be an
aetiological link between PSC and UC. At
present it is not clear whether ANCA in a
patient with PSC+UC is associated with the
UC or PSC or indeed if it represents two dif￾ferent antibodies. Although antibodies to
several constituents of neutrophils including
elastase,7 cathepsin G,8 9 lactoferrin,9 10 and
beta-glucoronidasell 12 have been reported in
some patients, it is clear that none of these is
exclusively responsible for the ANCA activity.
Determination of titre may be one way of dis￾tinguishing between UC only and UC+PSC
ANCA. Furthermore, in a recent report
Vidrich'3 suggested that, in contrast to UC
only, PSC (+/-UC) ANCA shows an increase
in IgG3 subclass specificity. The IgG sub￾classes are known to differ in their role in
immune response.14 Thus, determination of
the IgG subclass of PSC+UC and UC only
ANCA may not only distinguish between these
two groups and thus identify UC patients with
PSC, but may give valuable information on the
underlying immune mechanisms involved.
This study aimed, firstly, to determine the
prevalence and significance of ANCA in PSC
and UC and, secondly, to determine if
PSC+UC could be distinguished from UC
only by determination of the ANCA titre and
IgG subclass.

patients (37 men, median age 53 years, range
21-89) and 63 PSC patients (42 men, median
age 62 years, range 24-86) were studied. The
clinical details of UC and PSC patients are
given in Tables I and II respectively. All
patients with UC only had normal liver func￾tion. Thirty ANCA positive patients with UC
only (12 men, median age 47) and 27 ANCA
positive, PSC+UC patients (18 men, median
age 63) had ANCA IgG subclass determined.
Furthermore, sequential sera from four
PSC+UC and one UC only patient were
tested to look for variation of the IgG subclass
specificity with time. These samples were
drawn during subsequent routine visits to the
outpatients' department over at least a two
year period, and the disease was inactive on
each visit. The diagnosis of UC15 and PSC5
was based on a combination of established
histological and radiological criteria. All four
patients with normal endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatograms (Table II) had histo￾logical evidence of PSC (that is, had 'small￾duct PSC'). All seven PSC patients with no
evidence of concomitant inflammatory bowel
disease (Table II) had undergone complete
endoscopic and histological examination of the
colon. For the purpose of analysing the results,
the onset of inflammatory bowel disease was
defined as the time at which diagnosis was
made. Disease activity was defined according
to the criteria of Truelove and Witts.15
As a control population, we also studied 17
patients with coeliac disease (14 men, mean
age 41 years, range 23-65); 10 with dermatitis
herpeteformis (five men, mean age 60 years,
range 45-84); seven with cytoplasmic, ANCA
positive, Wegener's granulomatosis (all men,
median age 51 years, range 30-62); three
patients with pANCA positive systemic
necrotising vasculitis (all women, median age
41 years, range 21-69) and 36 normal healthy
volunteers (13 men, median age 43 years,
range 18-81).
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY
The prevalence, titre, antibody class, and IgG
subclass distribution of ANCA were deter￾mined by an alkaline phosphatase technique
developed in this department.4 For ANCA
prevalence and titre determination, all
patients' sera were initially tested at a dilution
of 1:5 on alcohol fixed neutrophils. Sera posi￾tive at 1:5 dilution were then retested at 1:50
dilution on alcohol fixed neutrophils and again
at 1:5 on formal acetone fixed neutrophils.
(The formal acetone fixative consisted of 36 ml
39% formaldehyde BDH 28421, 180 ml 100%
acetone BDH 27023, and 184 ml phosphate
buffered saline.) Antinuclear antibodies were
detected in the conventional way using rat liver
substrate and HEP 2 cells.
For ANCA positive individuals, the class of
ANCA response (that is, whether IgG, IgA, or
IgM) was determined using rabbit antibody to
human IgG, IgG, and IgM respectively
(DAKO, High Wycombe, UK). The IgG sub￾class was then determined for patients with IgG
ANCA. Five slides with alcohol fixed neutro￾phils were used for each serum sample tested.
All five were incubated with patient's serum,
diluted 1:5 in TBS (50 mM Tris, 145 mM
NaCl, pH 7.6) for 30 minutes. After two, three￾minute washes in TBS, slides 1-4 respectively
were incubated for 30 minutes with specific
mouse anti-human immunoglobulins directed
at IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. The specific
monoclonal antibodies used were HP 6001 for
IgGl, HP 6002 for IgG2, HP 6050 for IgG3,
and SK 44 for IgG4 (Sigma Immuno￾chemicals). The monoclonal antibodies were
diluted 1:100 in TBS before incubation. Slide
no 5 was the internal control slide and was
incubated with TBS only. After two further
three-minute TBS washes, bound antibody was
detected using indirect immunohistochemistry.
Alkaline phosphatase conjugated rabbit anti￾body to mouse immunoglobulin heavy chains
(DAKO, High Wycombe, UK) was used for
slides 1-4. This was diluted 1:10 in TBS. Slide
5 was incubated with rabbit antibody to human
immunoglobulin heavy chains (IgA/IgG/IgM)
(DAKO, High Wycombe, UK). This incuba￾tion lasted a further 30 minutes. Finally, after a
further two, three-minute TBS washes, fast red
TR salt was used as a substrate for alkaline
phosphatase.
Established negative and positive serum
controls were included with each assay as a
further internal control. In addition, the
neutrophil donor was rotated at regular inter￾vals to prevent any problems with the source of
neutrophils. All slides were read independently
by two observers (DB and KF).
Statistical analysis was by the Fisher exact
and Mann-Whitney U tests. A p value of
<0 05 was considered to be significant.

Results
ANCA PREVALENCE AND TITRE
The ANCA prevalence and titres for the differ￾ent groups studied are given in Table III. In
the UC group, ANCA prevalences at dilutions
of 1:5 and 1:50 were 38 of 85 (45%) and 21 of
85 (25%) respectively, and exclusively of the
perinuclear type (Fig 1). Taking the PSC
group as a whole, ANCA was detected in 41 of
63 (65%) at a serum dilution of 1:5 and 31 of
63 (49%) at a dilution of 1:50; and again was
perinuclear in type. The difference in ANCA
prevalence between the two groups was
statistically significant at both dilutions
(p=0.01 and p=0002 respectively, Fisher's
exact test). Comparing PSC+UC and UC
alone, the ANCA prevalences were 70% v 45%
at 1:5 and 54% v 25% at 1:50. Again the
difference was statistically significant at both
dilutions (p=0O004 and p=0-0006 respec￾tively, Fisher's exact test). Although the
ANCA prevalence in the PSC+CD group was
67%, and thus similar to the PSC+UC group,
the prevalence in the PSC only group was only
29% at a dilution of 1:5, dropping to 14% at
1:50.
All seven patients with Wegener's granulo￾matosis gave a cytoplasmic pattern of staining
but, as expected, the three patients with
systemic necrotising vasculitis also gave a peri￾nuclear pattern. This pattern was indis￾tinguishable from the perinuclear pattern in
the PSC and UC groups. All other controls
were negative (Fig 2).

Figure 1 Characteristic staining pattern in antineutrophil
cytoplasmic antibody positive sera. Note the granular
cytoplasmic staining with perinuclear accentuation.
Figure 2 Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody negative
sera. Note the 'ghostly' appearance of the neutrophils with
complete absence of staining throughout the cytoplasm.
Of the 41 ANCA positive PSC patients, 34
were negative when tested on formal acetone
fixed neutrophils, six gave a granular cyto￾plasmic pattern, and one a homogenous
cytoplasmic pattern. In the UC group, 33 of
the 38 patients positive on alcohol fixed
neutrophils gave no staining at all on formal
acetone fixed neutrophils, whereas the remain￾ing five demonstrated a granular cytoplasmic
pattern. Fifteen ANCA positive UC patients
were tested for ANA on rat liver substrate and
HEP 2 cells at a serum dilution of 1:5. Of
these, only two had ANA present at a 1:5
serum dilution. One of these had only a weak
ANA at a dilution of 1:40 but had ANCA
present at a dilution of at least 1:50. In the case
of the PSC ANCA positive group, six of the 18
tested had ANA at a titre of 1:40 or above.
In the case of the PSC group (Table IV), the
presence of ANCA was not affected by sex,
age, or liver histology. However, ANCA posi￾tivity was significantly associated with evidence
of both intrahepatic and extrahepatic PSC on
endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (18 of
37 or 49%) compared with ANCA negative
patients (3 of 19 or 16%) (p=0016, Fisher's
exact test). The ANCA negative PSC patients
were more likely to have intrahepatic PSC only
(13 of 19 or 68% v 14 of 37 or 38%) (p= 0.03).
There was no significant difference in the
distribution of inflammatory bowel disease
between the two groups.
For the UC group (Table V), again presence
of ANCA was not related to sex, age, treat￾ment, extent, or activity of disease. However,
ANCA positive patients had a significantly
longer median duration of disease (median 50
months, range 2-262) compared with ANCA
negative patients (median 28 months, range
1-37 1) (p=0-029, Mann-Whitney U test).
IgG SUBCLASS OF ANCA
Most UC and PSC ANCA belonged to the
IgG class. The ANCA IgG subclass distribu￾tion for the 30 UC only and 27 PSC+UC
patients tested is given in Table VI. The stain￾ing pattern was perinuclear in all cases. IgGl
was the predominant subclass in both
PSC+UC and UC only ANCA and IgG3 was
the second most common. Compared with UC

ANCA, PSC+UC ANCA showed a significant
increase in IgG3 (26% v 7%, p<O005, Fisher's
exact). A trend toward higher IgG2 and IgG4
expression was also noted in PSC+UC
ANCA. Most UC ANCA was IgGI only. The
combination of IgGl +IgG3 was detected in
26% of PSC+UC ANCA but only in 3% of
UC only ANCA (p=0015) (Table VII).
There was no association between IgG sub￾class and the clinical parameters shown in
Tables IV and V. Four PSC and one UC sera
tested repeatedly over time showed no vari￾ation of ANCA IgG subclass distribution.
Discussion
ANCA have been reported in 26-85% of
patients with PSC and up to 68% in those with
UC. They have high specificity for PSC and
UC compared with other liver and diarrhoeal
diseases respectively. We have previously
reported a highly sensitive and specific
immunoalkaline phosphatase method for
detecting this antibody in PSC.4 In the present
study we have shown that for adult cases of
PSC, ANCA has a diagnostic sensitivity of
65% at a serum dilution of 1:5 and 49% at a
dilution of 1:50. For UC only the sensitivities
were 45% and 25% respectively.
As in previous studies' 2 4 we were unable to
show any relationship between ANCA and the
extent of UC. Although ANCA positive UC
patients in this study were more likely to have
active disease and be on combination therapy
with a 5 aminosalicylic acid compound and

immunosuppressive drugs, this was not stat￾istically significant compared with the ANCA
negative UC patients. However, ANCA posi￾tive UC patients had a significantly longer
median duration of disease than ANCA
negative patients (Table V). The precise
importance of this finding is unclear as this has
not been shown by other groups,2 4 6 7 and
indeed in two of our 38 ANCA positive UC
patients, ANCA was detected even after they
had had a colectomy. This has been observed
by others2 and suggests that the diseased organ
is not essential for ANCA generation once a
clone of B cells has been 'programmed' for
antibody production.
The only significant association in the
ANCA positive PSC group (Table IV) was
with the presence of both intrahepatic and
extrahepatic disease, as judged by endoscopic
retrograde cholangiopancreatography. This
may suggest that ANCA positive PSC patients
are likely to develop more extensive disease.
Conversely, more extensive disease may pre￾dispose to the development of ANCA. In the
present study, no association of ANCA with
severity of PSC as judged by liver histology was
noted, but this may simply reflect the focal
nature of PSC. Indeed, whether radiologically
more extensive PSC is associated with histo￾logically more severe liver disease is also not
clear. A recent report suggested that ANCA
may be a prognostic marker in PSC because
ANCA positive PSC patients were more likely
to progress to liver transplantation. 16 However,
these patients were also more likely to have
biliary tract calculi and as this is associated
with recurrent cholangitis and a poorer out￾come it could be argued that in this study
ANCA was merely a marker of the presence of
calculi rather than of prognosis.
At present, the gold standard for diagnosis
of PSC remains an endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatogram.5 Liver histology,
although characteristic, may be focal, and liver
function tests are also unreliable. We have pre￾viously discussed the potential diagnostic use
of ANCA as a non-invasive test to screen for
PSC in childhood.'7 In the present study,
patients with PSC+UC had higher ANCA
titres than those with UC only (ANCA

diagnostic sensitivity of 54% v 25% at 1:50,
p=0.0006). The IgG subclass also differed
between PSC+UC and UC only ANCA, with
a significant increase in IgG3 ANCA in
PSC+UC patients. This result is in keeping
with a recent report by Vidrich'3 who demon￾strated increased IgG3 ANCA in PSC
irrespective of the presence of concomitant
UC. In the present study, higher levels of IgG2
and IgG4 were also detected in the PSC+UC
group. This different ANCA titre and IgG sub￾class distribution may reflect differences in
underlying immune mechanisms between UC
only and PSC+UC patients. Typically, IgGI
and IgG3 exhibit a stronger complement
activating capacity than the other IgG isotypes
and bind more firmly to Fc receptors on mono￾nuclear cells. 14 Furthermore, in Wegener's
granulomatosis, patients with renal involve￾ment have been shown to have higher levels of
the IgG3 isotype of ANCA and this has been
shown to correlate more closely with active
disease'8 suggesting that certain isotypes may
have a greater influence on disease patho￾genesis and be associated with different end￾organ involvement. In the current study, no
association was noted between any particular
ANCA IgG subclass and any of the clinical
parameters shown in Tables I and II.
Furthermore, serial measurements in four PSC
and one UC patient failed to show any
alteration in the ANCA IgG subclass distribu￾tion over time. We reviewed the case notes of
the two IgG3 ANCA positive UC-only patients
in this study and both had normal liver
biochemistry. A larger prospective study is
currently underway to investigate the signifi￾cance of the IgG3 isotype in UC as a possible
marker for the development of PSC and to
determine if certain IgG isotypes of ANCA
correlate more closely with disease activity in
UC and PSC.
IgGI and IgG3 were the predominant iso￾types in both UC only and PSC+UC ANCA.
This is in keeping with other autoimmune
conditions such as systemic lupus erythemato￾sus and Sjogren's syndrome.'9 In this respect
they differ from the vasculitis associated
ANCA which has relatively high levels of
IgGl and IgG4.20 In particular, no IgG4 was
detected in the UC group. These results are in
keeping with the recent findings of Ellerbroek
et al 9 who were also unable to detect an IgG4
response in UC ANCA, but found a predomi￾nance of IgGl and IgG3. In contrast to this, a
French group2' determined the IgG subclass
distribution in 21 patients with UC and found
a 100% IgGl response, 91% IgG3 response,
and lower levels of IgG2 (5%) and IgG4
(19%).
The close association between PSC and
UC5 and the high prevalence of ANCA in PSC
and UC compared with other liver and diar￾rhoeal diseases respectively is interesting and
suggests there may be an aetiological link. At
present it is not clear whether ANCA is UC or
PSC associated or can exist in both conditions
independently. The fact that ANCA has been
previously demonstrated in patients with either
PSC (without UC) or UC alone does not
necessarily mean that it is independently
occurring in these diseases. It is possible that
patients in these studies have undiagnosed UC
or PSC respectively.
The age of onset of UC typically precedes
that of PSC by 10-20 years. If ANCA is UC
associated and, as in this study, prevalence is
associated with longer median disease dura￾tion, then it could be argued that the higher
prevalence in UC+PSC may simply by a UC
associated phenomenon with PSC developing
as a complication of UC. In this context it is
interesting to note that ANCA positive PSC
patients in the present study tended to be older
than ANCA negative PSC patients (Table IV)
and both titre and IgG subclass of ANCA
differ between UC only and PSC+UC,
suggesting that an alteration in underlying
immune mechanisms may play a role in the
development of PSC. Similarly, it is interesting
to note that in the present study only 29% of
PSC only patients were ANCA positive at 1:5,
dropping to 14% at 1:50. This might also
suggest that ANCA in PSC+IUC is UC associ￾ated. Unfortunately the duration of UC in the
PSC+UC group could not be determined and
compared with the UC only group. Therefore,
whether the higher ANCA prevalence in the
former group was due to longer duration of
UC is not clear. However, patients with
PSC+Crohn's disease had a similar ANCA
prevalence to those with PSC+UC (67% and
70% at 1:5 respectively) as well as a similar
ANCA IgG subclass distribution (unpublished
observation). As the prevalence of ANCA in
Crohn's disease is very low (0/32 in a previous
study from our group4) this finding would
argue against ANCA being UC associated in
PSC+UC and suggests that it is due to the
PSC itself. In support of this, Duerr et al,'
using a combination of fixed neutrophil ELISA
and immunofluorescence, detected peri￾nuclear ANCA in 8 of 14 (58%) PSC only
sera. Furthermore, the detection of ANCA in
the serum of patients with autoimmune
hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis in some
studies3 22 23 also argues against it being UC
associated.
Unlike the vasculitides, the antigen(s) for
ANCA in PSC and UC has not been identified.
The perinuclear staining pattern is not a reliable
indication of the distribution of the antigen and
in Wegener's and other vasculitides is thought
to be an artefact of alcohol fixation caused by
the translocation of basic proteins to the nega￾tively charged nucleus.24 Thus, if neutrophils
are fixed in formaldehyde the redistribution of
antigen is prevented and the pattern becomes
cytoplasmic. Abolition of the staining pattern
altogether on formalin fixed neutrophils is more
typical of an antinuclear antibody. In this
respect our results on formalin fixed neutrophils
are interesting as, while most perinuclear stain￾ing UC and PSC sera showed loss of the signal
altogether, few had evidence of antinuclear anti￾bodies when tested in the conventional way on
rat liver substrate. This provides further evi￾dence that the antigen for UC and PSC ANCA
is not myeloperoxidase or other antigens
conventionally responsible for a perinuclear

staining pattern on alcohol fixed neutrophils.24
However, a predominance of the IgGl and
IgG3 isotypes for both UC only and PSC+UC
ANCA is in keeping with evidence to date
which suggests that the antigen is likely to be
proteinaceous in nature4 as this is the pre￾dominant response produced against protein
antigens. 14 Furthermore, although some
differences in IgG subclass distribution were
noted between UC only and UC+PSC ANCA,
suggesting possible differences in immune regu￾lation, this does not necessarily imply that the
antigen(s) for PSC ANCA differ(s) from that in
UC ANCA. In Wegener's granulomatosis the
same antigen (namely serine proteinase 3) is
able to elicit a variable IgG subclass response
and in this way influence the pathogenesis of the
disease process.1825 The same could conceiv￾ably be true of PSC and UC ANCA antigen(s).
In conclusion, in the present study we have
shown that ANCA is a diagnostic marker of
disease in both UC and PSC. In UC, ANCA
was associated with significantly longer median
disease duration whereas in PSC, ANCA was
significantly associated with the extent of
involvement of the biliary tree. Further studies
are needed to verify these findings. While the
higher titre and different IgG subclass distribu￾tion of ANCA in PSC+UC compared with
UC only suggests differences in underlying
immune regulation, determination of ANCA
titre and IgG subclass is unlikely to have a role
in distinguishing between PSC+UC and UC
only ANCA. Future identification of the anti￾gen(s) against which ANCA is/are directed
should allow the development of a more sensi￾tive and specific test for the diagnosis of these
conditions and also determine whether ANCA
is associated with UC or PSC.
