The production of high-affinity, class-switched antibody 
is important for the clearance of pathogens following 
infection, for the establishment of long-term humoral 
immunity and for the efficacy of vaccines. To make high￾affinity, class-switched antibody, B cells must receive 
cognate help from CD4+
 T cells during a germinal centre 
reaction1
. Germinal centres are discrete structures within 
the B cell follicles of secondary lymphoid organs in 
which the processes of somatic hypermutation, class switch 
recombination and affinity maturation of activated B cells 
occur accompanied by the production of memory B cells 
and plasma cells2,3. The CD4+ T cells that are responsible 
for providing help migrate into the germinal centre4–7
where, according to evidence from intravital microscopy, 
T cell–B cell interactions are weighted towards intense 
B cell competition for a small number of CD4+ T cells8
. 
The absence of T cell help during B cell priming leads to 
B cell apoptosis, rather than differentiation into germinal 
centre B cells or plasma cells9
.
The requirement of T cell help for B cell antibody 
production was first shown in the 1960s10,11. However, 
it took more than three decades before the subset of 
CD4+ T cells that provided this help was identified 
in germinal centres. Termed T follicular helper (TFH) 
cells12–14, these cells were found to have a unique ability 
to home to B cell follicles owing to their expression of 
CXC-chemokine receptor 5 (CXCR5) and to induce 
antibody production during co-culture with B cells12–14. 
In contrast to other T cell subsets, TFH cells were poor 
cytokine secretors, which led to their description as 
a non-polarized subset. However, cytokine produc￾tion in those early studies was examined in CXCR5+
memory CD4+ T cells from peripheral blood, and the 
relationship of these cells to bone fide TFH cells still 
requires clarification. Several studies have since shown 
that CXCR5+ TFH cells isolated from secondary lym￾phoid tissue can produce cytokines46,76. In conjunction 
with their unique localization in germinal centres, the 
capacity of TFH cells to provide help to B cells depends 
on their expression of molecules that influence T and 
B cell collaboration. TFH cells are defined by high levels 
of expression of inducible T cell co-stimulator (ICOS), 
programmed cell death 1 (PD1), the transcriptional 
repressor B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL-6) and cytokines 
that influence B cell differentiation and antibody pro￾duction such as interleukin-21 (IL-21) and IL-4. These 
features are present in both humans and mice; how￾ever, human TFH cells also express IL-10 (Refs 14,15), 
which has an important role in the differentiation 
of human B cells, and high levels of the chemokine 
CXCL13 (Ref. 16).
In this Review, I discuss our current understanding 
of TFH cell biology. Particular attention is given to recent 
studies designed to probe the relationship of TFH cells to 
other T helper (TH) cells and to determine whether TFH
cells are a distinct lineage. I also review the definition 
of the TFH cell phenotype in the context of increasing 
heterogeneity observed in the TFH cell subset.
Differentiation of TFH cells
The interaction of interdigitating dendritic cells (DCs) 
bearing peptide–MHC class II complexes and naive 
CD4+ T cells bearing T cell receptors (TCRs) with high 
affinity for antigen17 initiates the expression of a B cell 
follicle homing programme that leads to the recruit￾ment of TFH cell precursors to the T cell–B cell border in

A unique mutation mechanism 
that is targeted to the variable

New insights into the differentiation 
and function of T follicular helper cells
Cecile King
Abstract | The seminal studies characterizing T follicular helper (TFH) cells described a 
non-polarized CD4+
 T cell population with a unique ability to home to B cell follicles and to 
induce antibody production by B cells. In the past few years, the study of TFH cells has enjoyed 
a renaissance and there has been a surge of research activity aimed at understanding the 
function and differentiation of these important cells. This Review focuses on the current 
progress in TFH cell biology and the important questions that remain unanswered. Particular 
attention is paid to recent studies that support the idea that TFH cells are a separate T cell 
lineage and those that probe the relationship of TFH cells to other T helper cell subsets.

Asymmetrical cell division
A type of division that 
produces two daughter cells 
with different properties. This 
is in contrast to normal cell 
divisions, which give rise to 
equivalent daughter cells. 
Notably, stem cells can divide 
asymmetrically to give rise to 
two distinct daughter cells: 
one copy of themselves 
and one cell programmed to 
differentiate into another cell 
type.

migrate into the B cell follicle, where they may continue 
their differentiation programme18. TH cells that complete 
interactions with antigen-presenting cells or fail to estab￾lish interactions with B cells at the T cell–B cell border 
either leave the secondary lymphoid organ or participate 
in the stimulation of antibody production by B cells in 
extrafollicular foci. TFH cell differentiation is influenced 
by several factors in the local environment, including 
the interaction with B cells15,19 and the cytokine milieu 
(which in turn is determined by the pathogen or antigen 
encountered), and is likely to be finalized within the 
B cell follicle during the germinal centre reaction.
There are several possible scenarios for the genera￾tion of TFH cells: TFH cell fate may be decided at the first 
encounter of a naive CD4+ T cell with antigen (fIG. 1a), 
or at increasingly later points during TFH cell differentia￾tion (fIG. 1b, c). However, these models are not mutually 
exclusive and indeed might overlap, especially in the con￾text of TH cell plasticity20 and asymmetrical cell division21. 
Model 1 suggests that all TH cell subsets (that is, TH1, TH2, 
TH17, inducible regulatory T (TReg) cells and TFH cells) arise 
independently from distinct naive CD4+
 T cells immedi￾ately following the initial encounter with peptide–MHC 
class II complexes. In this model, TFH cells, but not other 
TH cell subsets, would arise exclusively from naive CD4+

Tcells bearing TCRs with the highest affinity for antigen17. 
Model 2 suggests that TFH cells share TH cell precursors 
with other differentiated TH cell subsets that migrate to 
non-lymphoid tissue sites. In this model, TH cells and 
TFH cells would emerge from the same pluripotent acti￾vated CD4+
 T cell precursor and TFH cells would be sub￾sequently selected from cells with the highest affinity for 
antigen17 through preferential interactions with B cells. In 
model 3, TFH cells and their ‘paired’ TH cell subset arise in 
a cytokine-competent manner22 from cytokine-polarized 
TH cell precursors that may include the coordinate genera￾tion of inducible TReg cells. However, precisely how TH cell 
fate is determined remains unknown.
Early events in the T cell zone
Antigen and TCR affinity. Several recent studies have 
focused on understanding how TFH cells are generated, 
but the exact timing and context of TFH cell differen￾tiation are subject to ongoing investigation. The initial 
events in the differentiation of TFH cells are common to 
all TH cell subsets. naive T cells that express the CD4 
co-receptor mature in the thymus and are phenotypically 
characterized by the absence of T cell activation surface 
markers. The first division of a naive CD4+ T cell occurs 
25–30 hours after TCR recognition of peptide antigen 
presented in the context of MHC class II molecules on 
the surface of interdigitating DCs in the T cell zone of 
secondary lymphoid tissues. The progeny of this ini￾tial clonal expansion is temporarily sequestered in 
the secondary lymphoid organ through the upregula￾tion of expression of the early activation marker CD69
and the transient downregulation of expression of the 
receptor sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1), 
which regulates egress of cells from lymphoid tissues23. 
Subsequently, within 2–3 days following appropriate 
exposure to differentiation signals, activated T cells 
then re-express S1PR1, allowing them to migrate out 
of the secondary lymphoid tissue into the circulation23. 
These emigrants include effector TH cells that are des￾tined for non-lymphoid tissue sites. By contrast, TH cells 
that retain cell surface expression of CD69 remain in the 
lymph node12,24. among these are CXCR5+ cells with 
the potential to become TFH cells6,7,25.
a central notion in the differentiation of CD4+
 T cells 
is that the TCR can transmit differing degrees of acti￾vating signals to initiate different effector outcomes26,27. 
In an effort to determine the important early events in 
TFH cell generation, a recent study showed that follow￾ing the transfer of CD4+ T cells into immunized mice, 
those T cells expressing TCRs with the highest affin￾ity to peptide–MHC class II complexes and the most 
restricted TCR diversity were selected into the TFH cell 
pool17. Thus, TFH cell differentiation requires strong sig￾nals through the TCR and/or sustained interactions with 
antigen-presenting cells.
The acquisition of cytokine competency. a range of 
antibody isotypes is typically produced in response to 
infection or immunization, with one or two isotypes 
predominating. The relative amounts of the different 
antibody isotypes that are produced are determined by 
cytokine signals that control immunoglobulin class switch 
recombination, which are still not completely under￾stood28. early after activation by antigen, CD4+ T cells 
can produce a wide range of cytokines, but this ability is 
progressively lost as they differentiate into discrete TH cell 
subsets with specific effector functions.
The interaction between cytokine-competent TH cell 
precursors and B cells is crucial for directing their differ￾entiation into various TH cell subsets and into antibody￾producing cells, respectively. In mice, the production 
of interferon-γ (IFnγ) and IL-4 is a characteristic, but 
not exclusive, feature of TH1 and TH2 cells, respectively. 
IL-4 induces sequential class switching to IgG1 and then 
to Ige, whereas IFnγ is associated with class switching to 
IgG2a29 (fIG. 2). Several studies have shown that cytokine 
competency is initiated through interaction with DCs, but 
the ability of activated CD4+
 T cells to produce IL-4 and 
IFnγ is initiated at the T cell–B cell border of lymphoid 
tissues22,30–32. The acquisition of cytokine production by 
TH cells at this site subsequently begins the process of 
isotype switching31,33. additional signals from the micro￾environment such as the cytokines IL-6 and IL-21 and the 
consequent activation of signal transducer and activator of 
transcription 3 (STaT3) downstream of cytokine receptor 
signalling enforce the generation of T cells with a helper 
phenotype that, at this early stage, maintain the ability to 
engage multiple differentiation programmes34–36. TFH cells, 
which are distinguished from other TH cell subsets by their 
high affinity for antigen and/or sustained interaction 
with B cells, migrate beyond the T cell–B cell border 
into the B cell follicle. Some or all of the TFH cells migrate 
while attached to B cells, as mobile conjugate pairs37
, to 
participate in the germinal centre reaction38.
TFH cell interactions with B cells 
Positioning of TFH cells in the B cell follicle. TFH cells are 
probably best defined by their expression of CXCR5, 
which, in conjunction with the loss of expression of 
CC-chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7), allows them to 
migrate into the CXCL13-rich B cell follicles of second￾ary lymphoid tissues, where they provide instructive cues 
for the differentiation of B cells6,7,12–14,25,39 (fIG. 3). However, 
CXCR5 expression is not unique to TFH cells and it has 
been estimated that ~50% of CD4+ T cells in antigen￾stimulated lymphoid tissues, such as human tonsils, are 
CXCR5+, but only a subset of these cells localize to the 
germinal centre12,13,39. In addition, CXCR5 is expressed 
by the subset of circulating CD4+ memory T cells men￾tioned above12,13,39. CXCR5 is expressed only transiently 
by CD4+
 T cells during interactions with peptide–MHC 
complexes on the surface of antigen-presenting cells and 
is dependent on co-stimulatory signals delivered through 
CD28, OX40 (also known as TnFSF4) and ICOS7,40,41. By 
contrast, persistent expression of CXCR5 distinguishes 
TFH cells from other fully differentiated non-germinal 
centre CD4+ T cells with B cell helper activity, such as 
those that participate in the differentiation of B cells to the 
plasma cells that are responsible for secreting low-affin￾ity antibody in extrafollicular foci or those that express 
other chemokine receptors and migrate to non-lymphoid 
tissue sites to carry out their effector functions12–14,17,22.

TH17 cell
A subset of CD4+ T helper cells 
that produce IL-17 and that 
are thought to be important in 
inflammatory and autoimmune 
diseases. Their generation 
involves IL-21 and IL-23, as 
well as the transcription factors 
RORγt and sTAT3.
For example, differentiated CD4+ T cells that express 
CCR6 tend to have a TH17 cell phenotype42, those that 
express CXCR3 are generally TH1 cells and those with 
CCR4 expression are largely TH2 cells43. Following immu￾nization, antigen-specific T cells show a higher and more 
homogeneous expression of CXCR5 than do polyclonal 
T cells7
, but whether preservation of CXCR5 expression 
by TFH cells reflects higher TCR affinity for antigen or 
sustained interaction with B cells remains unknown.
Co-stimulatory molecules. The expression of multiple 
co-stimulatory molecules is a feature of TFH cells, which 
may reflect both the sustained multi-signal integration 
required for their generation and their unique associa￾tion with B cells44 (fIG. 3). This association begins at the 
T cell–B cell border and continues into the B cell follicle, 
where TFH cells contribute to the germinal centre reaction. 
However, as numerous TH cell subsets can help Bcells pro￾duce antibody beyond the confines of the germinal centre, 
expression of these molecules per se does not adequately 
define a TFH cell. Rather, TFH cells have been shown to 
express higher levels of these molecules than any other TH
cell subsets, which correlates with an enhanced capacity 
to facilitate antibody production12–14,45,46.
Co-stimulatory molecules positively regulate B cell 
differentiation, as indicated by the defective humoral 
immune responses in mice and humans with muta￾tions in the genes CD40LG (which encodes CD40 ligand 
(CD40L)) and ICOS47–50. The interaction between CD40
(also known as TnFRSF5) on B cells and CD40L, which 
is transiently expressed by activated CD4+
 T cells, stimu￾lates B cell proliferation and facilitates cytokine-induced 
class switching51–53. ICOS is expressed at high levels by TFH
cells (and TH2 cells) and is induced following T cell acti￾vation44. Once engaged by its ligand (ICOSL) on B cells, 
ICOS induces the production of TH cell-type cytokines 
such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 and IL-21 (Refs 44,54,55). Studies 
showing that ICOS deficiency is associated with a reduc￾tion in the germinal centre reaction and fewer TFH cells in 
mice and humans implicate ICOS signalling in the main￾tenance and/or generation of TFH cells41,56. In addition, 
the elevated expression of OX40, which is expressed by 
activated T cells, has been shown to denote TFH cells, but 
its role in TFH cell function remains unknown17,57.
PD1. PD1 is an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibi￾tory motif (ITIM)-containing inhibitory molecule that is 
highly expressed by TFH cells17,18. The expression of inhibi￾tory molecules by TFH cells might reflect their role in the 
germinal centre as they favour strong cognate interactions 
with B cells18. PD1 expression by CD8+ T cells is associ￾ated with chronically activated or exhausted cells, but 
whether this is true for CD4+
 T cells is not yet known58.
IL-21. as discussed above, the generation of highly differ￾entiated TH cell subsets depends on the integration of mul￾tiple co-stimulatory signals that are received during the 
interaction of TH cells with antigen-presenting cells; IL-21 
seems to provide one of these signals (fIG. 3). However, 
the role of IL-21 in TH cell differentiation remains contro￾versial, which may reflect the fact that the production of 
IL-21 is common to both recently activated CD4+
 T cells 
and differentiated TH cell subsets46,59–65. It is of interest that 
IL-21 is expressed most highly by TFH cells, and the recent 
demonstration of greater levels of IL-21 in germinal centre 
TFH cells than in TH2 cells located in the lungs supports the 
idea that high IL-21 expression is a specialized feature of 
TFH cells17,22,46,63. analyses of mice in which IL-21–IL-21 
receptor (IL-21R) interactions have been disrupted indicate 
that IL-21 is important for the generation of TFH cells34,65
Figure 2 | Antibody class switching is directed by cytokines. A range of cytokines produced by T follicular helper 
(TFH) cells can direct antibody class switching. The acquisition of T cell cytokine competency begins in the T cell zone 
and precursor TFH cells have the capacity to induce class switching during their interaction with B cells at the border 
of the T cell zone and B cell follicle. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) induces the switch to IgG1 production (and then IgE 
production, not shown), and interferon-γ (IFNγ) induces the switch to IgG2a production. BCR, B cell receptor;

and has a crucial role in TH cell differentiation before the 
acquisition of B cell follicle homing capacity by TFH cells65. 
IL-21 also regulates expression of the TFH cell transcrip￾tion factor BCL-6, but the point at which IL-21 influences 
TFH cell subset differentiation remains unclear.
IL-21 also has a well-established role in B cell prolif￾eration and differentiation46,66–68. However, the observa￾tion that efficient IgG1 production by IL-21R-deficient 
B cells could be restored by IL-21R-sufficient CD4+
T cells indicates that the role of IL-21 in B cell responses 
has a degree of redundancy, possibly with IL-4 (Ref. 65). 
Similarly, IL-6 may be sufficient for the differentiation of 
some TH cell subsets in the absence of IL-21, as IL-6 and 
IL-21 both have the ability to activate STaT3 (Refs 36,61). 
In addition to STaT3, IL-21 activates numerous path￾ways that are common to other co-stimulatory molecules
such as ICOS. In the case of sanroque mice, in which a 
point mutation in a ubiquitin ligase results in the consti￾tutive overexpression of ICOS, IL-21 is not required for 
the generation of TFH cells69.
SLAM-associated protein. Given that multiple proteins 
contribute to the interactions of CD4+ T cells with DCs 
and B cells, it has been difficult to determine, at a T cell￾intrinsic molecular level, which interactions are impor￾tant for programming TFH cell differentiation. However, a 
recent study has revealed that SLaM-associated protein 
(SaP; also known as SH2D1a) has an important role 
in the B cell-influenced differentiation of CD4+ T cells 
into TH cell subsets19. SaP is an adaptor molecule that 
is known to bind to signalling lymphocytic activation 
molecule (SLaM) and modulate both TCR signalling 
and TH2 cell differentiation19. In human X-linked lympho￾proliferative disease, which is caused by loss-of-function 
mutations in the gene encoding SaP (SH2D1A), and in 
an analogous gene-targeted mouse model there is a pro￾found defect in germinal centre formation70. Live imag￾ing of the dynamics of the interaction of CD4+ T cells 
with DCs and B cells following immunization revealed 
that SaP expression by T cells was important for the sta￾bility of antigen-dependent T cell–B cell interactions but

dispensable for T cell–DC interactions19. Supporting a 
crucial role for SaP in TFH cell generation, the introduc￾tion of a null allele of SaP into sanroque mice led to a 
reduction in TFH cell numbers and abrogated germinal 
centre formation and autoantibody formation69.
Transcription factors. It remains unknown whether 
TFH cells are fully differentiated once they migrate into 
the B cell follicle or whether they complete their differen￾tiation programme during the germinal centre reaction, 
but recent studies have revealed that, like that of other 
fully differentiated TH cell subsets, lineage commitment 
of TFH cells is controlled by the expression of transcription 
factors71. The discovery of specific transcription factors 
that act as master controllers of cytokine gene expression 
to establish lineage-specific transcriptional programmes 
has greatly advanced our understanding of TH cell lineage 
commitment. It is now established that T-bet (also known 
as TBX21) determines TH1 cell lineage commitment and 
cytokine production, GaTa-binding protein 3 (GaTa3) 
drives TH2-type cytokine production72,73, retinoic acid 
receptor-related orphan receptor-γt (RORγt) directs the 
differentiation of the TH17 cell subset74, and the expression 
of forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) programmes TReg cell devel￾opment and function75 (fIG. 1). However, many transcrip￾tion factors are not unique to distinct TH cell subsets and 
may function in the generation of multiple TH cell subsets. 
For example, the transcription factor MaF, previously 
shown to be crucial for IL-4 production, has an essential 
role in generating both TFH cells and TH17 cells76. MaF 
functions downstream of ICOS76 and has been shown to 
transactivate IL-21 (Ref. 77).
Transcriptional profiles obtained from microarray 
analysis identified BCL-6 among the transcription fac￾tors that were upregulated in TFH cells but not other effec￾tor TH cell subsets63, and this finding has been confirmed 
by recent studies17,22. In BCL-6-deficient mice, T cell￾dependent antibody responses are reduced owing to an 
absence of germinal centres, an observation that had 
been attributed to a B cell-intrinsic defect78. Consistent 
with this interpretation, BCL-6 expression is largely con￾fined to B cells within germinal centres, where it acts as a 
master regulator of germinal centre lineage commitment, 
suppressing plasma cell differentiation by the extrafol￾licular pathway. Recently, however, BCL-6 has also been 
shown to act as a transcriptional repressor in TFH cells, 
indicating that BCL-6 expression in both T and B cells is 
required for germinal centre reactions79–81. Forced expres￾sion of BCL-6 in CD4+ T cells could suppress both TH1 
and TH17 cell differentiation pathways while enhancing 
the development of characteristic features of TFH cells79,81. 
In an analogous study, the analysis of BCL-6-deficient 
CD4+ T cells and overexpression of BCL-6 in CD4+
T cells showed that BCL-6 expression was both necessary 
and sufficient for in vivo TFH cell differentiation80. By con￾trast, the transcriptional repressor B lymphocyte-induced 
maturation protein 1 (BLIMP1; also known as PRDM1), 
which is highly expressed in the T cell zone but not in 
germinal centre T cells, was shown to inhibit TFH cell 
generation, indicating reciprocal regulation of these two 
transcription factors during TFH cell differentiation17,80.
Despite the importance of BCL-6 for TFH cell genera￾tion, expression of BCL-6 protein has been observed in 
only 10–15% of CD4+
 T cells located in the germinal cen￾tres of human tonsils82. whether these BCL-6-positive 
cells are a functionally distinct population of TFH cells 
in the B cell follicle or are terminally differentiated TFH
cells remains unknown. In this regard, it is possible that 
BCL-6 is expressed by TFH cells during a defined period of 
time or in conjunction with antagonistic transcription fac￾tors17
, and the ability of BCL-6 to downregulate the secre￾tion of cytokines such as IL-4 suggests that continuously 
high expression of BCL-6 in germinal centre T cells might 
be counterproductive83.
The expression of master controller transcription fac￾tors is used to define TH cell lineage commitment, but the 
unique expression of these factors may not be definitive 
for TH cell fate. epigenetic modifications influence the 
binding of transcription factors to the promoter regions 
of genes, contributing to the heritability of TH cell lineage 
decisions, and evidence is emerging that these decisions 
remain open to revision. Through the analysis of the 
chromatin state in resting and effector T cells (including 
TH1 cells, TH2 cells, TH17 cells cultured in vitro and TReg
cells), a recent study has revealed the retention of both 
permissive and repressive transcription factor binding 
(bivalent) marks in TH cell-specific genes, including 
those of transcription factors20. Transcription factor 
genes in a bivalent state have the potential for subsequent 
activation or silencing, suggesting that TH cells retain the 
potential for functional revision20. Interestingly, exami￾nation of the Il21 loci of TH1, TH2 and TReg cells indicated 
that Il21 transcription is strongly suppressed in these 
cells20, predicting a heritable distinction with TFH cells 
that highly express IL-21. Future studies will be needed 
to determine whether TH cells differentiated in vivo, 
including TFH cells, have similar potential for plasticity 
at the level of epigenetic modifications.
The fate of TFH cells
The fate of TFH cells after resolution of the germinal centre 
reaction remains an important area of investigation. Live 
imaging of germinal centre cell dynamics indicates that 
B cells can move bidirectionally between the B cell follicle 
and the germinal centre, but there is currently no evidence 
to support bidirectional movement of TFH cells84,85. Thus, it 
seems unlikely that TFH cells give rise to the fully differen￾tiated TH cell subsets that migrate to non-lymphoid tissues 
(or vice versa). One possible outcome is that TFH cells are 
terminally differentiated and die owing to the presence of 
high cell surface levels of CD95 (also known as TnFRSF6) 
and PD1 expression, which render them susceptible to 
apoptosis45,86. alternatively, TFH cells may remain in situ,
either as bone fide memory T cells or as effector T cells 
that continue to survive owing to persisting antigen87–89.
a recent study showed the existence of a population 
of CD69+CXCR5+ TFH cells that remained in close prox￾imity to CXCL13+ follicular DCs for an extended period 
of time24. These cells could be rapidly reactivated to 
express effector molecules following secondary immu￾nization and thus behave like antigen-specific memory 
T cells. TFH cells were found in the vicinity of ‘depots’

IL-4-reporter mice
Genetically engineered 
knock-in mice in which the 
gene encoding IL-4 has been 
replaced by sequences that 
encode a reporter molecule, 
such as green fluorescent 
protein (GfP). When the IL-4

GfP is expressed and GfP+

of peptide–MHC class II complexes in the draining 
lymph node after resolution of the germinal centre 
reaction, suggesting that local triggering of the TCR 
maintains the expression of CXCR5 and CD69 (Ref. 24). 
using IL-4-reporter mice, TFH cells were also observed to 
make IL-4 protein more rapidly following secondary 
challenge with antigen than cells involved in the pri￾mary response90. Thus, antigen-specific TFH cells can be 
detected for some time after an immune response and 
have the potential to interact with B cells to promote 
antibody production following secondary challenge or 
have some as yet unknown function. However, several 
studies indicate that CD4+ T cells are not necessary for 
the long-term maintenance of memory B cells or IgG￾producing plasma cells91,92. Further work will be needed 
to determine whether TFH cells meet their demise at the 
resolution of the germinal centre reaction for which they 
were purposefully generated or whether the population 
of memory TFH cells that persist in lymphoid organs 
after the resolution of the germinal centre reaction can 
improve the outcome of a reinfection.
The relationship between TH cell subsets 
TFH cells can produce cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-10 and 
IL-21, that promote the survival, proliferation and differ￾entiation of B cells12,14,15,22,46. However, the recent identifi￾cation of IFnγ-producing TFH cells coupled with evidence 
of their capacity to produce IL-17 shows that TFH cells may 
have a more heterogeneous pattern of cytokine produc￾tion than was previously appreciated14,18,22,24,34. There are 
several possible explanations that could reconcile these 
observations; for example, cytokine expression by TFH cells 
has typically been measured relative to the abundance of 
cytokines produced by fully differentiated TH cells63 or 
by chronically activated tonsilar tissue following ex vivo
re-stimulation and may lead to cytokine expression from 
cells that may or may not express cytokines in vivo12,13.
TFH cells and TH2 cells. TH2 cells have long been regarded 
as the main providers of help for antibody production by 
B cells. However, the observation that IL-4-deficient mice 
can generate T cell-dependent antibody responses sug￾gested that IL-4 is not necessary for antibody production 
perse93. TFH cells and TH2 cells have a degree of common￾ality in that the targeted deletion of the genes encoding 
MaF, ICOS and IL-21R impairs the generation of both 
cell subsets34,54,56,65,72,76,94,95. nevertheless, TFH cells can be 
clearly distinguished from TH2 cells by their high levels 
of expression of both CXCR5 and BCL-6 and by their 
reduced levels of expression of BLIMP1 and the TH2 cell￾associated chemokine receptor CCR4 (Refs 17,22,63,96).
Recently, several groups have analysed the relation￾ship between IL-4-producing CD4+ T cells and TFH
cells using IL-4-reporter mice22,90,97. These transgenic 
mice express either a single reporter gene marking cells 
that express Il4 mRna (IL-4-competent cells) or a dual 
reporter gene marking both cells that express Il4 mRna
and those that actually secrete IL-4 protein. The analyses 
of TH cell differentiation during infection of IL-4-reporter 
mice confirm previous reports showing that TFH cells can 
express IL-4 (Refs 14,18,24,46) and show that most IL-4 
production is localized to the Bcell follicle22,90. The finding 
that CXCR5–
PD1–
IL-4-competent CD4+
 Tcells from mice 
immunized with serum schistosome egg antigen (Sea) 
could upregulate CXCR5 and PD1 on adoptive transfer 
into naive hosts subsequently immunized with Sea sug￾gests a relationship between TH2 and TFH cells97. However, 
whether fully differentiated TH2 cells can migrate into the 
B cell follicle and become TFH cells requires clarification. 
Similarly, in contrast to previous studies of cell tran￾scriptional profiles63, elevated levels of mRna encod￾ing GaTa3 were reported in IL-4-competent CD4+
T cells that also expressed PD1 (Ref. 97). These findings 
offer important insights into the relationship between 
TH2 cells and TFH cells and support the notion that these 
cells may derive from a common precursor. However, 
they also emphasize the current limitations of the pheno￾typic characterization of TFH cells on the basis of high 
expression of common CD4+
 T cell activation markers.
By contrast, during infection of the dual IL-4 reporter 
mice with Leishmania major, IL-4-producing TFH cells 
could be distinguished from IL-4-producing TH2 cells by
their high expression of CXCR5 and IL-21 (Ref. 22). The 
isolation of T cell–B cell conjugates from the lymph node 
draining the site of L. major inoculation showed that 
IgG1-producing Bcells made contact with IL-4-producing 
T cells, whereas IgG2a-producing B cells made contact 
with IFnγ-producing T cells22 (fIG. 3). IL-4-producing 
T cells were found conjugated to germinal centre B cells 
that expressed high levels of activation-induced cytidine 
deaminase (aID) and had hallmarks of somatic hyper￾mutation22. These findings indicate that TFH cells can 
produce cytokines that direct the production of differ￾ent antibody isotypes and the affinity maturation of 
antibodies in the responding B cells.
TFH cells and TH1 cells. TFH cells can be distinguished 
from TH1 cells on the basis of their homing potential and 
tissue localization, which are largely due to their selective 
expression of CXCR5 and CXCR3, respectively. In con￾trast to IL-4, the typical TH1-type cytokine, IFnγ, only 
weakly supports B cell survival and proliferation and 
was not originally detected at high levels in TFH cells63. 
Recently, however, TFH cells have been shown to express 
levels of the TH1 cell-associated transcription factor T-bet 
that were equivalent to the levels observed in both non￾TFH CD4+
 T cells and effector T cells with non-lymphoid 
migratory capacity17. In addition, as noted above, IFnγ￾producing TFH cells were detected in the germinal centre 
and found conjugated to IgG2a-producing germinal 
centre B cells in the draining lymph node following 
L. major inoculation (fIG. 3). Interestingly, B cells con￾jugated with IFnγ-producing TH cells had much lower 
levels of aID expression than those conjugated with IL-4-
producing TFH cells, suggesting an enhanced capacity of 
IL-4-producing T cells to direct antibody class switch￾ing22. However, as infection with L. major and other para￾sites, and also immunization with haptenated proteins 
in the presence of alum adjuvant, are expected to pro￾duce IL-4-dominant responses, additional studies will be 
required to determine the proportion of IFnγ-producing 
TFH cells during an IFnγ-biased humoral response.

Experimental autoimmune 
encephalomyelitis
An experimental model for the 
human disease multiple 
sclerosis. Autoimmune disease 
is induced in experimental 
animals by immunization with 
myelin or peptides derived 
from myelin. The animals 
develop a paralytic disease 
with inflammation and 
demyelination in the brain and 
spinal cord.
TFH cells and TH17 cells. a key early discovery in the 
study of the TH17 cell subset was the identification 
of the transcription factor RORγt, which specifies 
TH17 cell lineage commitment. Interestingly, TFH cells 
can produce IL-17 without expressing RORγt 34,65. 
nevertheless, the relationship between TH17 cells and 
TFH cells remains incompletely understood. For exam￾ple, in autoimmune BXD2 mice, which spontaneously 
develop glomerulonephritis and erosive arthritis, 
IL-17-producing TH cells localize in B cell follicles and 
promote germinal centre reactions98. Production of 
IL-17 by TFH cells is not restricted to BXD2 mice; for 
example, it has been detected in ICOShiCXCR5+ TH cells 
from the spleen and draining lymph nodes in mice with 
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (eae)76. 
TFH cells and FOXP3+ TReg cells. new evidence that TFH
cells can be generated from TReg cells challenges the 
view that TFH and TReg cells are distinct subsets99. using 
reporter mice in which FOXP3 expression is marked 
by expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein 
(FOXP3eGFP mice), preferential generation of TFH cells 
from FOXP3+ T cells rather than FOXP3–
 T cells was 
observed in the Peyer’s patches when donor cells were 
adoptively transferred into lymphopenic mice. The 
resulting TFH cells were efficient at promoting germi￾nal centre reactions and Iga production99. By contrast, 
FOXP3+ T cells neither differentiated into TFH cells nor 
supported germinal centre formation in the spleen or 
lymph nodes under the same experimental conditions, 
demonstrating a unique microenvironment for the gen￾eration of TFH cells from FOXP3+ TReg cells in the Peyer’s 
patches99. Despite the detection of a small number of TFH
cells in the germinal centre, the physiological relevance 
of a population of germinal centre TReg cells that can 
suppress B cell responses remains unknown100,101.
Clinical relevance
understanding the ways in which TFH cells are gener￾ated and regulated offers a unique challenge for both 
the improved design of protein vaccines and the treat￾ment of antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases. 
Immunological tolerance among T cells is of paramount 
importance for the control of autoimmune antibody spe￾cificities, therefore it is likely that TFH cells provide inap￾propriate helper signals to self-reactive B cells in cases 
of antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases. CXCR5+
T cells that express increased levels of PD1 and ICOS 
can be found in the blood of patients with systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLe) and Sjogren’s syndrome102,103. 
Their activated phenotype indicates that they are 
distinct from circulating CXCR5+
 Tcells that are found in 
normal subjects, suggesting some ‘spill over’ of TFH cells 
from extra-lymphoid tissues in these autoimmune con￾ditions. There are numerous examples of murine models 
of autoimmunity in which the inhibition of the func￾tion of TFH cell-associated molecules, such as CD40L, 
ICOS, SaP and IL-21, results in reduced autoantibody 
production104–109. Blocking CD40–CD40L interactions 
similarly prevents autoantibody production and the 
aberrant accumulation of germinal centre-like B cells 
and plasmablasts in the peripheral blood of patients 
with SLe110. Mouse models of SLe are characterized 
by a TFH cell-like transcriptome in their spleens111,112, 
and in sanroque mice the expansion of TFH cell pop￾ulations resulting from excessive signalling through 
ICOS mediates increased autoantibody production and 
renal pathology112.
a better understanding of the biology of TFH cells 
could also aid our understanding of how to therapeu￾tically target certain T cell lymphomas113. For exam￾ple, the transcriptome of angioimmunoblastic T cell 
lymphoma (aITL) shares many similarities with that 
of TFH cells, giving some insight into the cell of origin. 
Malignant aITL cells are CD4+ T cells that express 
BCL-6 (Refs 82,114,115), CXCR5, CD40L, OX40 and 
PD1 (Refs 116,117) and produce CXCL13 (Ref. 118)
and are unique in their expression of CD10 (also 
known as neprilysin)119. Several studies have proposed 
that increased production of CXCL13 and constitutive 
expression of CD40L by malignant TFH cells may lead to 
increased recruitment of B cells into follicles, their aber￾rant activation and subsequent hypergammaglobulin￾aemia116,120. TFH cell markers are also observed in 
neoplastic cells of cutaneous CD4+ small/medium-sized 
pleomorphic T cell lymphoma (CSTCL), suggesting that 
B cell stimulation by TFH cells could also take place in 
some cutaneous T cell lymphomas121.
Concluding remarks
Recent studies have advanced our understanding of 
TFH cell biology, but several questions remain unanswered. 
First, is the heterogeneity of cytokine production from 
TFH cells indicative of their pluripotency or are there dis￾tinct TFH cell subsets as part of a broader TFH cell family? 
Second, with regard to T cell plasticity, it is not known 
whether TFH cells can differentiate into other TH cell sub￾sets outside of the germinal centre microenvironment or 
whether fully differentiated TH cell subsets can become 
TFH cells if given the correct signals. In this regard, it 
would be of interest to examine epigenetic modifications 
in TFH cell-specific genes. Third, the ability of BCL-6 to 
suppress the production of IL-4, IFnγ and IL-17 suggests 
that Bcl6 is either highly regulated and/or acts in con￾junction with other, antagonistic transcription factors 
during TFH cell differentiation, but how Bcl6 expression 
is coordinated in TFH cells remains unknown. Finally, 
it will be important to determine whether the TFH cells 
that participate in the selection of higher-affinity B cell 
clones in the germinal centre are the same cells that 
initiate class switching.
Studies continue to emerge indicating that CD4+
T cells have more functional plasticity than is generally 
appreciated99,122,123. These studies challenge our criteria 
for differentiated TH cell subsets and question whether 
irreversible cell differentiation is achieved before cell 
death. Our Cartesian approach towards the classifica￾tion of TH cell subsets helps us to understand certain 
aspects of TH cell differentiation but, unfortunately, this 
might be at the cost of understanding the remarkably 
flexible nature of CD4+ T cells, which arises in response 
to their unique microenvironments.
