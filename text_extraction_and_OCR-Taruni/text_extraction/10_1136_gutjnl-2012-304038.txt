ABSTRACT
Objective Non-selective β-blockers or endoscopic band
ligation (EBL) are recommended for primary prophylaxis
of variceal bleeding in patients with oesophageal
varices. Additional α-adrenergic blockade (as by
carvedilol) may increase the number of patients with
haemodynamic response (reduction in hepatic venous
pressure gradient (HVPG) of ≥20% or to values
<12 mm Hg).
Design Patients with oesophageal varices undergoing
measurement of HVPG before and under propranolol
treatment (80–160 mg/day) were included. HVPG
responders were kept on propranolol (PROP group),
while non-responders were placed on carvedilol (6.25–
50 mg/day). Carvedilol responders continued treatment
(CARV group), while non-responders to carvedilol
underwent EBL. The primary aim was to assess
haemodynamic response rates to carvedilol in
propranolol non-responders.
Results 36% (37/104) of patients showed a HVPG
response to propranolol. Among the propranolol non￾responders 56% (38/67) eventually achieved a
haemodynamic response with carvedilol, while 44%
(29/67) patients were finally treated with EBL. The
decrease in HVPG was significantly greater with
carvedilol (median 12.5 mg/day) than with propranolol
(median 100 mg/day): −19±10% versus −12±11%
(p<0.001). During a 2 year follow-up bleeding rates for
PROP were 11% versus CARV 5% versus EBL 25%
(p=0.0429). Fewer episodes of hepatic decompensation
(PROP 38%/CARV 26% vs EBL 55%; p=0.0789) and
significantly lower mortality (PROP 14%/CARV 11% vs
EBL 31%; p=0.0455) were observed in haemodynamic
responders compared to the EBL group.
Conclusions Carvedilol leads to a significantly greater
decrease in HVPG than propranolol. Using carvedilol for
primary prophylaxis a substantial proportion of non￾responders to propranolol can achieve a haemodynamic
response, which is associated with improved outcome
with regard to prevention of variceal bleeding, hepatic
decompensation and death.
INTRODUCTION
Portal hypertension (PHT) is responsible for the
majority of complications of patients with cirrhotic of
the liver, for example, the development of oesopha￾geal varices, ascites, hepatorenal syndrome, hyperdy￾namic circulation and hepatic encephalopathy.1 2

Significance of this study
What is already known on this subject?
▸ Pilot trials have shown that carvedilol, a NSBB
with additional anti-α1-adrenergic activity may
decrease portal pressure more effectively than
propranolol.
▸ A randomised controlled trial comparing
carvedilol to EBL for primary prophylaxis of
variceal bleeding showed fewer bleeding events
in the carvedilol group.
▸ Carvedilol may cause arterial hypotension and
worsen renal function potentially compromising
its beneficial effect in the long term.
What are the new findings?
▸ Carvedilol is effective in a substantial
proportion of patients who did not achieve a
haemodynamic response to propranolol.
▸ The mean decrease of portal pressure is
significantly more pronounced under carvedilol
(−19%) than under propranolol (−12%).
▸ Higher doses of carvedilol (>12.5 mg/day) may not
further decrease portal pressure, while increasing
the risk of arterial hypotension and bradycardia.
▸ A long-term follow-up of up to 2 years is
reported even showing a benefit in terms of
reduced incidence of hepatic decompensation
and improved survival.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the
foreseeable future?
▸ Carvedilol may replace propranolol as a NSBB
without anti-α1-adrenergic activity in primary
prophylaxis of variceal bleeding—at least in
patients without arterial hypotension or renal
dysfunction.
▸ Carvedilol doses of 6.25–12.5 mg/day might be
adequate for primary prophylaxis of variceal
bleeding.
▸ A haemodynamic response to β-blockers is
associated with a lower risk of hepatic
decompensation and mortality.
▸ The efficacy of EBL for primary prophylaxis in
non-responders to β-blockers is limited and
other options such as transjugular intrahepatic
portosystemic shunt implantation should be
investigated in future trials.

Patients with oesophageal varices are at risk of variceal bleeding,
especially if varices are large or present red spot signs.3 4 Despite
advances in the management of acute variceal bleeding the inhospi￾tal mortality is still as high as 20%.5
Earlier studies have already shown that achieving a haemo￾dynamic response to non-selective β-blockers (NSBB) (defined
as a decrease in hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) of
≥20% compared to baseline values or to absolute values
<12 mm Hg) treatment may protect from variceal bleeding.6–8
Consequently, current guidelines9 suggest pharmacological treat￾ment with NSBB or endoscopic band ligation (EBL) for the pre￾vention of the first variceal bleeding episode. Nadolol and
propranolol have traditionally been used for prophylaxis of vari￾ceal bleeding,10–13 while carvedilol represents a promising drug
that needs to be explored further.9 Carvedilol is a racemic
mixture that possesses both non-selective β1/2-antagonist and
α1-receptor antagonist activity.14 Given its combined mechanism
of action, carvedilol may have a greater potential for lowering
portal pressure than propranolol.15 16
The haemodynamic response to carvedilol has already been
assessed in earlier studies: A small pilot study in 16 patients17
demonstrated a fall in HVPG from 16.7 to 13.6 mm Hg
without a significant reduction in azygos blood flow. Mean
arterial pressure (MAP) dropped from 94.8 to 84 mm Hg, while
heart rate decreased only in patients with ascites. No changes in
cardiac output, renal vein blood flow, or systemic vascular resist￾ance were observed.
A randomised trial comparing the acute administration of carve￾dilol to propranolol has shown a more effective reduction in
portal pressure with carvedilol than with propranolol, while carve￾dilol caused a more pronounced fall in MAP.18 Arterial hypoten￾sion caused by carvedilol may eventually prevent its long-term use
in cirrhotic patients with hyperdynamic circulation and impaired
renal function. The efficacy and safety of the long-term use of car￾vedilol compared to propranolol in portal hypertensive patients
was addressed in another study,19 showing that the proportion of
patients achieving a haemodynamic response was greater with car￾vedilol. After a median observation period of 11 weeks, carvedilol
caused a significant decrease in MAP, a significant increase in
plasma volume and body weight. While the glomerular filtration
rate was unchanged with carvedilol, doses of diuretics were
increased more frequently in the carvedilol group.19
The only long-term randomised trial using carvedilol for
primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding compared with EBL
demonstrated significantly lower bleeding rates under carvedilol
than with EBL treatment.20 However, a fixed dose of carvedilol
(12.5 mg/day) was used and haemodynamic response to carvedi￾lol has not been evaluated by HVPG in that trial.20
Despite these promising data on the use of carvedilol, no data
on the efficacy of carvedilol in patients not responding to pro￾pranolol—as assessed by repeated HVPG measurements—are
available. As pointed out by some experts14 19 and the current
guidelines,9 further data on the long-term efficacy of carvedilol
for primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding are needed.
Therefore, the primary aim of our study on primary prophy￾laxis of variceal bleeding was to evaluate haemodynamic
response rates to carvedilol in propranolol non-responders.
Secondary aims were: (1) to compare the antiportal hyperten￾sive effects of carvedilol to propranolol; (2) to assess the sys￾temic haemodynamic effects of carvedilol and propranolol;
(3) to evaluate the incidence of variceal bleeding during primary
prophylaxis of variceal bleeding; and (4) to report the rates of
hepatic decompensation and mortality during long-term
follow-up in propranolol, carvedilol, and EBL-treated patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients
This study was conducted from 2008 to 2012 following the
ethical principles of the revised Helsinki Declaration and was
approved by the local ethics committee. Patients with cirrhotic
referred for haemodynamic evaluation of PHT were eligible for
the study. Inclusion criteria were the presence of oesophageal
varices at upper gastrointestinal endoscopy21 without a previous
haemorrhage and a basal HVPG value greater than 12 mm Hg.
Exclusion criteria were as following: age less than 18 years, pre
or posthepatic causes of PHT, severe liver failure (serum biliru￾bin >5 mg/dl or international normalised ratio (INR) >2.5),
uncontrolled hepatic encephalopathy, alcohol consumption, or
intravenous drug abuse, renal insufficiency (serum creatinine
>1.5 mg/dl), contraindications to NSBB, a diagnosis of hepato￾cellular carcinoma (HCC) or other malignancy, or refusal to par￾ticipate in the study. Patients with cirrhotic due to alcoholic
liver disease had to be abstinent for at least 3 months before
inclusion, which was evaluated by clinic visits every 4 weeks. All
patients gave their written informed consent to participate in
the study and to the publication of their anonymised data.
Treatment and dosing of NSBB
The dose of NSBB was titrated according to systolic arterial
blood pressure (ABPsys) and heart rate (HR), as previously
described.22 Doses were increased weekly until ABPsys was not
less than 95 mm Hg and HR was not less than 50 bpm. Patients
receiving propranolol (Inderal, Astra Zenica, Austria) started at
a dose of 40 mg/day and the dose was increased weekly (in
40 mg steps) according to ABPsys and HR to a maximum dose
of 160 mg/day. By retrospective analysis of haemodynamic data
recorded in our haemodynamic laboratory, propranolol target
doses of 80–160 mg/day were chosen, as the haemodynamic
efficacy of propranolol doses less than 80 mg/day was poor
(<10% haemodynamic response) and only 3% of patients could
tolerate (eg, vertigo, nausea, headache) propranolol doses
greater than 160 mg/day. Carvedilol (Dilatrend, Hoffmann
La-Roche, Vienna, Austria) was started at a dose of 6.25 mg/day
and titrated to a maximum dose of 25 mg/day by steps of
6.25 mg per week (except in patients with concomitant arterial
hypertension, who were started with 12.5 mg/day and increased
up to 50 mg/day). Compliance with therapy was monitored by
monitoring of HR and blood pressure during clinical visits.
Sample size calculation and study design
After baseline haemodynamic assessment, treatment with pro￾pranolol was initiated and titrated according to ABPsys and HR
(figure 1). After 4 weeks a second HVPG measurement was per￾formed under the maximal tolerated dose of propranolol and
the haemodynamic response was evaluated. Haemodynamic
response was defined as a decrease of HVPG of more than 20%
compared to baseline or a decrease to absolute values less than
12 mm Hg.7 9 Haemodynamic responders to propranolol were
kept on propranolol (PROP group), while haemodynamic non￾responders were then switched to carvedilol with weekly
increasing doses until the maximum tolerated dose. If patients
were intolerant to propranolol or were not able to increase the
dose of propranolol to 80 mg/day or greater, they were directly
started with carvedilol. There was no wash-out phase between
propranolol and carvedilol treatment. In patients switched to
carvedilol, a third HVPG measurement was performed after
4 weeks of carvedilol treatment to evaluate the haemodynamic
response to carvedilol. Again haemodynamic responders to

carvedilol were kept on carvedilol (CARV group), while carvedi￾lol non-responders underwent EBL every 2–4 weeks until eradi￾cation of varices. After eradication of varices, endoscopy was
repeated every 6 months to re-evaluate the presence of varices
and eventually to perform additional band ligations. According
to this protocol, three groups entered the follow-up period:
1. PROP group: patients with haemodynamic response to
propranolol.
2. CARV group: patients with haemodynamic response to
carvedilol.
3. EBL group: patients not responding/intolerant to propran￾olol/carvedilol as evaluated by HVPG and who were
treated by EBL until eradication of varices.
One hundred and fourteen patients had to be included to
guarantee a sample size of 68 patients needed for the primary
analysis, assuming a propranolol response rate of 40%.
A sample size of 68 patients had a calculated 90% power to
detect a decrease in portal pressure of 2 mm Hg with carvedilol
in the group of propranolol non-responders, assuming a SD of
differences of 5 mm Hg and using a paired t test with a 0.05
two-sided significance level.
All patients in the three treatment groups were followed up
every 3 months with clinic visits including laboratory testing to
evaluate treatment-related side effects, bleeding rates, laboratory
abnormalities, renal function and mortality during propranolol,
carvedilol and EBL treatment for primary prophylaxis of vari￾ceal bleeding. Hepatic decompensation was defined as hepatic
encephalopathy grade 3/4, development of ascites, variceal
bleeding, or jaundice.
Measurement of HVPG and liver stiffness
Measurement of HVPG was performed as an outpatient proced￾ure according to reference methodology23 as previously
described.24 Briefly, under ultrasound guidance and local anaes￾thesia a catheter introducer set was placed in the right internal
jugular vein by using the Seldinger technique. A balloon catheter
was introduced over the upper and lower inferior caval vein by
passing the heart into a large liver vein. Correct placement and
sufficient wedge position were checked by x-ray. At least three
repeated measurements of free and wedged hepatic vein
pressure were performed to calculate HVPG. Pressure curves
were continuously recorded via a haemodynamic interface con￾nected to a PC and by using licensed software (S5 Collect,
Vienna, Austria) for subsequent print-out and evaluation. Liver
stiffness was measured by transient elastography (Fibroscan,
Echosens, France) as previously described.25
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were expressed as mean±SD. Categorical
variables were expressed as median and range. Comparison
between baseline and follow-up haemodynamic variables were
computed using the paired Student’s t test. The decrease in
HVPG by propranolol or carvedilol was calculated in relation to
the baseline HVPG assessment, respectively. The haemodynamic
effects of propranolol and carvedilol were compared using the
non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test. The significance levels
between the proportions were calculated by Fisher’s exact test
or the χ2 test. Rates of variceal bleeding and hepatic decompen￾sation, and transplant-free survival (TFS) were calculated by
Kaplan–Meier analysis and compared by log-rank test. A p value
of less than 0.05 was considered to denote statistical
significance.
RESULTS
Patient characteristics
Within the study period 173 cirrhotic patients without a history
of variceal haemorrhage were referred for evaluation of PHT
(table 1). Among those patients, 25 did not show oesophageal
varices at endoscopy and 17 patients had a baseline HVPG
value of 12 mm Hg or less. Twenty-one patients met the exclu￾sion criteria of the study protocol (HCC, 12; portal vein throm￾bosis, seven; renal insufficiency, two), while six patients refused
to participate in the study. Finally, a total of 104 cirrhotic
patients with oesophageal varices and a baseline HVPG greater
than 12 mm Hg were included in the study protocol. The
majority of patients were men (77%) with a mean age of
53 years. The main aetiologies of cirrhotic were alcoholic (55%)
or viral liver disease (33%). Sixty-six, 30, and eight patients pre￾sented with Child–Pugh stages A, B and C, respectively.
Forty-one patients showed small varices at upper gastrointestinal

endoscopy, 63 patients presented with large varices and
32 patients had red spot signs. At baseline, the mean HVPG was
20.5 mm Hg and mean liver stiffness was 44.7 kPa.
Haemodynamic response rates and treatment groups
After baseline HVPG measurement, 104 patients were placed
on propranolol (figure 2). While 10 patients did not tolerate
propranolol doses of at least 80 mg/day or were generally
intolerant to propranolol, 94 patients were evaluated under pro￾pranolol treatment. Thirty-nine per cent (37/94) of patients
showed a haemodynamic response and were kept on propran￾olol. Among the 57 propranolol non-responders, 56% (32/57)
achieved a haemodynamic response to carvedilol. All 10 patients
who could not be evaluated under sufficient propranolol doses
were started with carvedilol and showed good tolerance to car￾vedilol treatment, with 60% (6/10) showing a haemodynamic
response. All together, the haemodynamic response rate to car￾vedilol was 57% (38/67). Finally, 28% (29/104) patients could
not achieve a haemodynamic response to NSBB and were
treated with EBL until variceal eradication, while 72% (75/104)
of patients showed a HVPG-controlled response to pharmaco￾logical treatment with propranolol or carvedilol. Thirty-seven,
38 and 29 patients entered the follow-up period on propranolol
(PROP), carvedilol (CARV) and EBL treatment (EBL), respect￾ively. No drop-outs were recorded during haemodynamic evalu￾ation, for example, between the baseline HVPG measurement
and assessment under carvedilol.
Haemodynamic effects of NSBB
Mean baseline HVPG values were 20.5 mm Hg, mean HVPG
values under propranolol were 18±1 mm Hg (p<0.01 vs base￾line), and 16±4 mm Hg (p<0.01 vs baseline) under carvedilol
treatment, respectively (table 2 and figure 2). The decrease in
HVPG was significantly more pronounced in carvedilol-treated
(n=67) patients than in propranolol-treated (n=94) patients:
−19±11% vs −12±12% (p<0.001).
In patients with non-response to propranolol a further significant
reduction in HVPG of 13% (19.3 vs 16.6 mm Hg; p<0.01) could
be achieved with carvedilol treatment. The mean HVPG values
were lower under carvedilol treatment than under propranolol treat￾ment, both in haemodynamic responders (15.8±3.2 vs 15.1
±3.5 mm Hg; p=0.046) and in haemodynamic non-responders to
pharmacological therapy (19.3±3.5 vs 18.3±3.3 mm Hg;
p=0.031).
Concerning systemic haemodynamics, a significant reduction
in MAP was found in patients treated with propranolol (−11
±14%; p<0.01) and carvedilol (−14±14%; p<0.01). Similarly,
HR significantly decreased under propranolol (−23±12%;
p<0.01) and carvedilol (−17±15%; p<0.01) treatment. MAP
(88±14 vs 83±14; p=0.452) and HR (62±10 vs 66±10;
p=0.203) were similar under propranolol and carvedilol treat￾ment, respectively.
The influence of drug dosing on haemodynamic parameters
During the 4-week interval between the HVPG measurements,
the doses of propranolol and carvedilol were increased according
to HR, ABPsys and patient tolerance (table 3). The mean dose of
propranolol was 97.6±20.4 mg/day (median 100 mg/day) with
67 patients receiving low-dose (80–100 mg/day) and 27 patients
receiving high-dose (120–160 mg/day) propranolol, respectively.
When comparing the doses of propranolol between haemo￾dynamic responders (99.6±19.7 mg/day) and non-responders
(93.6±20.2 mg/day) no significant differences were found
(p=0.612). The mean dose of carvedilol was 17.1±6.8 mg/day

(median 12.5 mg/day) with 40 patients receiving a low dose
(6.25–12.5 mg/day) and 27 patients receiving a high dose (25–
50 mg/day) of carvedilol, respectively.
Comparing patients with low and high doses of propranolol,
no significant differences in MAP (p=0.328), HR (p=0.106)
and HVPG (p=0.930) were observed. Patients receiving
high-dose carvedilol showed significantly greater reductions in
MAP (−17±10 vs −11±13%; p=0.043) and HR (−20±12 vs
−12±15%; p=0.033) than patients receiving low-dose carvedi￾lol treatment. However, the degree of HVPG reduction was
similar in patients receiving high-dose and low-dose carvedilol
treatment, respectively (−20±10% vs −18±12%; p=0.442).
Bleeding rates during follow-up
During a mean follow-up of 19.5 months, 13% (14/104) of
patients experienced an episode of variceal bleeding (figure 3A
and table 4). Significantly lower bleeding rates were observed in
the haemodynamic responders (PROP/CARV) when compared
to the EBL patients (11%/8% vs 24%; p=0.0429). Notably, no
patient bled between enrolment and assignment to a treatment
group. Among the propranolol non-responders, a significantly
lower incidence of variceal bleeding was observed in the CARV
arm compared to the EBL arm (p=0.0218).
Hepatic decompensation and mortality
Overall, 38% (40/104) of patients showed hepatic decompensa￾tion during follow-up with ascites (n=13), variceal bleeding
(n=11), hepatic encephalopathy (n=8) and jaundice (n=8) as
reasons for hepatic decompensation (figure 3B,C and table 4).
When comparing hepatic decompensation between haemo￾dynamic responders and EBL-treated patients, a trend towards a

20.5 mm Hg. Ninety-four patients were evaluated under propranolol treatment (while 10 were intolerant to a propranolol dose of at least 80 mg/day)
with 39% of patients achieving a haemodynamic response to propranolol. The 67 patients with propranolol non-response or intolerance were
evaluated under carvedilol and 57% achieved a haemodynamic response to carvedilol. The mean decrease in HVPG under propranolol and carvedilol
was −12% and −19%, respectively, as compared to baseline HVPG. (B) Patients with non-response to propranolol were switched to carvedilol
according to the study protocol. Among these 57 patients, a further reduction in HVPG from 19.3 mm Hg to 16.6 mm Hg (−13%) was achieved.
(C) This figure shows the mean values of patients at baseline, under propranolol (separately for propranolol responders and non-responders), and
under carvedilol (separately for carvedilol responders and non-responders), respectively. A significant reduction in HVPG was found both with
propranolol (p<0.01) and with carvedilol (p<0.01). When comparing the subgroups, mean HVPG values were lower under carvedilol treatment than
under propranolol treatment, both in haemodynamic responders (15.8±3.2 vs 15.1±3.5 mm Hg; p=0.046) and in haemodynamic non-responders to

higher rate of hepatic decompensation was noted in the EBL
group (55%) than in the PROP (38%) or CARV (26%) groups
(p=0.0789). Most, importantly among propranolol
non-responders, carvedilol responders had a significantly lower
incidence of hepatic decompensation than EBL-treated patients
(26% vs 55%; p=0.0351). The development of ascites (p=0.031)
and variceal bleeding (p=0.012) were significantly more common
in the EBL group than in haemodynamic responders (PROP/
CARV). Overall, 9% (9/104) of patients were diagnosed with
HCC during follow-up, with no significant differences among the
treatment groups.
Seventeen per cent (18/104) of patients died during follow-up
and 9% (9/104) underwent liver transplantation. When
comparing TFS among patients treated with propranolol, carve￾dilol, or EBL, respectively, TFS was significantly higher in the
haemodynamic responders CARV/PROP than in the EBL group
(mean 495 vs 417 days; p=0.0455). A trend towards longer TFS
was noted in carvedilol responders compared to EBL-treated
patients (mean 484 vs 417 days; p=0.0618). The better survival
in the PROP/CARV groups was mainly due to fewer
bleeding-related and liver-related deaths, while deaths from other
causes were observed with similar frequencies in the EBL group.

propranolol including data on long-term follow-up. We evalu￾ated the responses rates to carvedilol in HVPG-documented
non-responders to propranolol treatment and showed that a sig￾nificant proportion of propranolol non-responders (∼50%) can
achieve a haemodynamic response to carvedilol treatment.
Carvedilol had significantly greater effects on portal pressure
than propranolol (−19% vs −12%), while changes in MAP and
in HR were not significantly different between propranolol and
carvedilol-treated patients. In summary, approximately
two-thirds (72%) of our patients achieved a haemodynamic
response to NSBB when carvedilol was used as ‘rescue’ treat￾ment in propranolol non-responders. Approximately one-third
(28%) of patients did not achieve a haemodynamic response
and were finally treated with EBL until eradication of varices.
When using only propranolol for prophylaxis of variceal bleed￾ing, a substantial number of patients would have remained at
higher risk of variceal bleeding, because haemodynamic response
was only achieved in 39%. Carvedilol was able to decrease the risk
of bleeding substantially in propranolol non-responders, as a
further reduction in portal pressure of −13% could be achieved
resulting in haemodynamic response rates of 56% among propran￾olol non-responders. Using this ‘a la carte’ approach of
HVPG-guided NSBB therapy and EBL in pharmacological non￾responders, the overall rate of first variceal bleeding was low at
13% during a follow-up period of 2 years. Lower bleeding rates
were observed in haemodynamic responders (PROP/CARV
groups) than in haemodynamic non-responders (EBL group).
Most importantly, carvedilol was significantly more effective in
preventing variceal bleeding in propranolol non-responders than
EBL, underlining that achieving a haemodynamic response is asso￾ciated with better prognosis in the long term.6–8
In addition, we investigated potential differences in systemic
haemodynamics between propranolol and carvedilol treatment.
When using median doses of 100 mg/day of propranolol and
12.5 mg/day of carvedilol, no differences in MAP and HR were
observed between the PROP and CARV groups, respectively.
However, the doses of propranolol used in previous trials varied
from 80 mg/day to 320 mg/day and were not consistent. As dose
finding studies have not been performed to identify the ‘best
portal-hypotensive’ dose for carvedilol in cirrhotic patients with
PHT so far, the optimal dose needs to be defined. Higher doses
of carvedilol—as with propranolol—may cause an even greater
decrease in portal pressure, but systemic arterial hypotensive
effects may limit the use of higher doses in the long run.
Therefore, we used the currently recommended approach of
titrating the NSBB dose according to ABPsys and HR, and com￾pared the effects of different propranolol and carvedilol doses on
systemic and portal haemodynamics. An increase of propranolol
doses from 80–100 mg/day to 120–160 mg/day did not result in
a significant further decrease of MAP, HR, or HVPG. In contrast,
an increase of carvedilol doses from 6.25–12.5 mg/day to 25–
50 mg/day significantly further decreased MAP and HR without
an additional effect on HVPG. These haemodynamic results
support the use of low carvedilol doses of 6.25–12.5 mg/day,
because this would—at least to some degree—avoid adverse
effects related to arterial hypotension or bradycardia.
The current recommendations9 to use either NSBB or EBL for
primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding are based on studies that
did not assess the haemodynamic response to NSBB. Although it
seems likely that a substantial number of NSBB non-responders
were also treated with NSBB in those studies, NSBB showed an
equal performance compared to EBL in terms of survival but were
less effective for primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding.26 Now
having a more potent drug such as carvedilol that may lead to
haemodynamic response in up to 72% of all treated cirrhotic
patients, pharmacological prophylaxis may perform better than
EBL, as suggested by the study of Tripathi et al.20
We also evaluated the incidence of hepatic decompensation and
mortality during a 2-year follow-up period according to the treat￾ment group. Overall, 38% of our patients experienced an episode
of hepatic decompensation during follow-up. Haemodynamic
responders to propranolol and carvedilol had a lower incidence of
hepatic decompensation than the EBL group, while the difference
was only significant when comparing carvedilol responders to
EBL-treated patients. Interestingly, even TFS was better in the
haemodynamic responders to propranolol and carvedilol than in
the EBL group. NSBB may thus be an independent protective
factor for hepatic decompensation, at least in patients with varices
and haemodynamic response. Still, the potential adverse effects of
long-term carvedilol treatment on systemic haemodynamics and
renal perfusion have to be considered.19 In addition, a recent
study reported increased mortality when using NSBB in cirrhotic
patients with ascites.27 It seems that if NSBB are used in cirrhotic
patients with varices (who have an indication for NSBB), achieving

a haemodynamic response to the NSBB propranolol or carvedilol
exerts beneficial effect in terms of reducing the risk of hepatic
decompensation (including the development of ascites) and mor￾tality.6–8 In our study, we were also able to demonstrate a favour￾able prognosis and improved survival in well-compensated
patients with cirrhotic achieving a haemodynamic response to
NSBB over a period of 2 years; however, the long-term survival
rates of cirrhotic patients on continuous NSBB treatment should
be investigated further.
One limitation of our study is the lack of randomisation at
baseline or at the time of propranolol non-response, which may
have introduced a bias in the study population. However,
post-hoc comparisons of baseline characteristics revealed no sig￾nificant differences in important prognostic baseline parameters
in cirrhotic patients with PHT. Most importantly, the degree of
PHT (HVPG) and the severity of liver disease (Child–Pugh
score, model of end-stage liver disease) were similar among the
PROP, CARV and EBL groups. The proportion of patients with
large oesophageal varices was numerically higher in the EBL
group than in the PROP/CARV groups, while the prevalence of
red spots signs was higher in the PROP/CARV groups than in
the EBL group. The exclusion of patients with severe liver
failure and/or with hepatorenal syndrome may limit our findings
to those patients with compensated liver disease, especially
when considering the recent data27 on the potential detrimental
effects of NSBB in patients with cirrhotic and refractory ascites.
‘High-dose’ NSBB treatment was better tolerated in the
CARV group than in the PROP group, which may have contrib￾uted to the higher haemodynamic response rates in the CARV
group. However, the cut-off between low and high doses was
chosen empirically and no study to date has shown a clear cor￾relation of NSBB dosing and rates of haemodynamic response.
In addition, our comparison of dose and haemodynamic effects
has shown that higher doses of carvedilol have more pro￾nounced systemic haemodynamic effect (on MAP and on HR),
but are not associated with a further decrease of portal pressure.
This study shows that carvedilol is a well-tolerated and highly
effective drug for the pharmacological treatment of PHT.
Carvedilol shows great efficacy in haemodynamic non-responders
to propranolol resulting in a substantial increase in the proportion
of haemodynamic responders, with up to 72% of medically treated
patients achieving a HVPG response. Bleeding rates during a
follow-up period of 2 years were significantly lower in haemo￾dynamic responders to propranolol and carvedilol than in patients
treated with EBL. Our data suggest that increasing the dose of car￾vedilol above 12.5 mg may just increase unwanted systemic/renal
side effects while lacking a greater portal-hypotensive effect. The
optimal dose of carvedilol will have to be assessed in separate dose￾finding studies. Most importantly, achieving a carvedilol response
in propranolol non-responders is associated with a reduced risk of
hepatic decompensation and increased TFS compared to
EBL-treated propranolol non-responders.
