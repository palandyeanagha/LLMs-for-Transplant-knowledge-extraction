Abstract
Six cases of full spontaneous closure of congenital coronary artery
fistulas, and one case of near closure, as seen by colour Doppler
echocardiography, are presented. It is worth reconsidering the
classical view that nearly all cases of spontaneous closure are
eligible for surgical or percutaneous correction to prevent the
development of significant and potentially fatal complications. As
the natural course of coronary artery fistulas is still poorly defined,
asymptomatic patients, especially those under 7 years old with
small shunts, should be periodically followed up by
echocardiography rather than be subjected to operative closure,
even by catheterisation.
