ABSTRACT
Background Pulmonary hypertension (PHT) lacks
community prevalence and outcome data.
Objective To characterise minimum ‘indicative’
prevalences and mortality data for all forms of PHT in
a selected population with an elevated estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure (ePASP) on
echocardiography.
Design Observational cohort study.
Setting Residents of Armadale and the surrounding
region in Western Australia (population 165 450) referred
to our unit for transthoracic echocardiography between
January 2003 and December 2009.
Results Overall, 10 314 individuals (6.2% of the
surrounding population) had 15 633 echo studies
performed. Of these, 3320 patients (32%) had
insufficient TR to ePASP and 936 individuals (9.1%, 95%
CI 8.6% to 9.7%) had PHT, defined as,
ePASP>40 mm Hg. The minimum ‘indicative’
prevalence for all forms of PHT is 326 cases/100 000
inhabitants of the local population, with left heart
disease-associated PHT being the commonest cause
(250 cases/100 000). 15 cases of pulmonary arterial
hypertension/100 000 inhabitants were identified and an
additional 144 individuals (15%) with no identified cause
for their PHT. The mean time to death for those with
ePASP >40 mm Hg, calculated from the first recorded
ePASP, was 4.1 years (95% CI 3.9 to 4.3). PHT increased
mortality whatever the underlying cause, but patients
with PHT from left heart disease had the worst prognosis
and those with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension
receiving disease-specific treatment the best prognosis.
Risk of death increased with PHT severity: severe
pulmonary hypertension shortened the lifespan by an
average of 1.1 years compared with mild pulmonary
hypertension.
Conclusions In this cohort, PHT was common and
deadly. Left heart disease was the most common cause
and had the worst prognosis and treated pulmonary
arterial hypertension had the best prognosis.
INTRODUCTION
Pulmonary hypertension (PHT) is defined as
a sustained increase in mean pulmonary arterial
pressure (mPAP) to >25 mm Hg, measured using
right heart catheterisation (RHC). PHT is typically
suspected after echocardiographic investigation of
breathlessness; the pulmonary artery systolic pres￾sure (PASP) being estimated from tricuspid regur￾gitation velocity, using the modified Bernoulli
equation. PHT has many underlying causes,
including left heart, respiratory and pulmonary
vascular diseases. Pulmonary arterial hypertension
(PAH) is a subset of PHT, with normal pulmonary
artery wedge pressure and increased pulmonary
vascular resistance >3 Wood units.1 2
PHT has been classified numerous times, most
recently via an interdisciplinary collaboration of
international societies.2e4 PHT classification
accounts for approximately 40 diseases associated
with its clinical presentation, characterised by
progressive dyspnoea, functional limitation and if
untreated, right ventricular failure and death.5
Most PHT-related diseases are not linked and may
have potentially different treatments and survival
trajectories. However, community-based reports of
clinical characteristics, progression and prevalence
of specific PHT subtypes are lacking.5e11
We sought to characterise the minimum preva￾lence and prognostic impact of each PHT subtype
in a selected population using a retrospective anal￾ysis of individuals with an elevated estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure (ePASP) on
echocardiography.
METHODS
This study conforms to the STROBE recommen￾dations for reporting cohort studies.12
Study setting
Armadale and its catchment area (2006 population,
165 450) is located 30 km southeast of the city of
Perth, Western Australia. Armadale’s population is
broadly representative of Australia’s population:
mean ages being 35 versus 36 years, male popula￾tion 49.6% versus 49.4%, Australian born 63%
versus 70% and indigenous population 2.5% versus
2.6%, respectively. Cardiological management is
largely ‘captive’ with a single adult echocardiog￾raphy laboratory in Armadale managing nearly all
local referrals.
Study cohort
We conducted a retrospective echocardiography
database search of residents within the Armadale
catchment referred to our unit for transthoracic
echocardiography between January 2003 and
December 2009 and who had an elevated ePASP
$40 mm Hg. Patients with an ePASP <40 mm Hg
or insufficient tricuspid regurgitation preventing
PASP estimation were excluded. Mean cohort
follow-up was 1060 days (2.962.0 years) from the
index echocardiogram. The study was approved by

Echocardiography
All echocardiograms were obtained by an experienced sonogra￾pher using a GE Vivid 7, GE Vivid i (GE Vingmed Ultrasound AS,
Horten, Norway), or a Philips iE33 (Philips, Seattle, USA) cardiac
ultrasound machine. Images were stored digitally using
commercial software (Prosolv Cardiovascular) and reported by
a senior echocardiologist in accordance with published guide￾lines.13 Standard complete two-dimensional echocardiography
was performed in all individuals, with chamber quantification
assessed according to published criteria.14 PAP was assessed by
imaging the peak velocity of the tricuspid regurgitant jet (TRV)
and applying the simplified Bernoulli equation (right ventricular
systolic pressure (RVSP)¼4v2 + right atrial pressure.15 16 For
standardisation, a right atrial pressure of 10 mm Hg was
assumed for all patients unless clear features were present that
suggested otherwise. Insufficient tricuspid regurgitation was
defined as incomplete TRV or inability to identify peak velocity
with confidence.
Identification and coding of pulmonary hypertension
Using the SQL database (Prosolv Cardiovascular echo software),
a query search was built. Classified separately, patients with
insufficient tricuspid regurgitation did not contribute to PHT
prevalence estimates. All patients with an estimated PAP
>40 mm Hg between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2009
were included. Patients with PHT were prospectively separated
into three clinically relevant groups: ePASP 40e50 mm Hg
(mild), 51e60 mm Hg (moderate) and >60 mm Hg (severe).
Patients were coded for referral type and identified PHTcausality
according to published guidelines.4 17 Clinical data and echo￾cardiographic results were used to determine PHT causality (eg,
those with a history chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were
classified as respiratory-related PHT, unless significant left heart
disease was detected). Where required, the patient’s general
practitioner was consulted for more definitive information. If
the cause was still not clear from these data, the cause of the
PHTwas deemed to be ‘unknown’. In addition, if the findings on
echocardiography suggested possible left heart disease, but the
degree of PHT appeared ‘out of keeping’ with the degree of left
heart disease, the cause was classified as ‘unknown’. In patients
with two or more known causes of PHT, the dominant cause
was classified.
PHT causality was coded using criteria and subcategories of
the ACC working group classifications; group 1: PAH, group; 2:
PHT in association with left heart disease; group 3: PHT in
association with hypoxic respiratory disease; group 4: PHT due
to chronic thrombotic and/or embolic disease and group 5:
miscellaneous.18
Two sets of blinded coding were undertaken (including
a consultant echocardiologist (DP)) then finalised by consensus
or with further consultation with a specialist from respiratory
medicine (EG). If causality remained undetermined the case was
classified as ‘unknown’.
Identified cases of PAH were managed through the advanced
lung disease unit at Royal Perth Hospital. All were rigorously
investigated to elucidate the cause of PHT, including respiratory
function tests, sleep studies, high-resolution CT scan, VQ scan,
CT pulmonary angiogram and RHC.
Study follow-up
Mortality was investigated in all cases from the time of the first
recorded ePASP to a census date (31 December 2009). Time to
death was established using individual linked data extracted
from the Western Australian Department of Health Database.
Statistics
Quantitative variables are described using means6SD and
medians with the 25th and 75th IQR where applicable. Cross
tabulations using the c2 statistic were used with non-parametric
KruskaleWallis test to compare differences. We employed
logistical and Cox proportional regression models to evaluate
factors associated with mortality (such as age, sex, aetiology of
PHT and the degree of PHT). The detection rates of PHT are
calculated as the ratio of existing and newly diagnosed patients
at the censor date 31 December 2009 (excluding those who had
died during the follow-up period) and the estimated total
Armadale and surrounding districts adult population according
to the last Australian census survey performed in 2006.19
Mortality data are expressed as cumulative survival and with the
use of KaplaneMeier estimates.
RESULTS
Cohort characteristics
Between January 2003 and December 2009, 10 314 individuals
(6.2% of the population), had 15 633 echocardiography studies
performed for various reasons, including investigations of
murmurs, ventricular function, breathlessness and PHT. Of
these, 3320 patients (32%) had insufficient tricuspid regurgita￾tion to measure PASP. Nine hundred and thirty-six individuals
(9.1%, 95% CI 8.6 to 9.7%) had echocardiographic evidence of
PHT (ie, TVR profiles clearly demonstrated the maximum
velocity and ePASP was >40 mm Hg). This proportion is
slightly greater than the 6.6% reported in the INCIPIT study.20
The characteristics of patients with PHT and included in the
analysis are presented in table 1.
Of the 936 individuals with elevated ePASP, 636 (68%)
patients had left heart disease as the dominant cause, 87 (9%)
with respiratory disease (n¼74 (7.9%)) or sleep-related hypo￾ventilation (n¼13 (1.3%))-associated PHT, 19 (2%) had chronic
pulmonary thromboembolic disease, 25 (2.7%) had other

diseases (‘miscellaneous’) causing PHT and 144 (15%) had PHT
with no known cause from the available data. Thirteen patients
had congenital heart disease-associated PAH (CHD/PAH,
median age 43 (IQR 39e75), median PASP 56 mm Hg (IQR
50e67)), four patients with scleroderma-associated PAH (SSc/
PAH, median age 71 (IQR 62e71), median PASP 94 mm Hg
(IQR 80e95)) and eight patients were diagnosed with idiopathic
PAH (iPAH, median age 63 (IQR 52e78), median PASP
56 mm Hg (IQR 50e84)). In total, 25 (2.7%) of our final PHT
patient cohort had PAH (WHO group 1) confirmed by RHC
after thorough evaluation at a tertiary centre. There was
borderline significant differences between median ePASP
(p¼0.0496). All eight patients with iPAH, all four patients with
SSc/PAH scleroderma and five of the patients with CHD/PAH
received disease-specific PAH treatment during at least part of
the study period.
Indicative prevalence of pulmonary hypertension
Figure 1 shows the cumulative number of cases (all patients still
alive at 31 December 2009) of all forms of PHT in our popula￾tion, based on ePASP using echocardiography. We calculated
a minimum indicative prevalence for all forms of PHT of 326
identified cases/100 000 of the population (groups 1e5). PHT
due to left heart disease was the most common cause for PHT in
our population (250 cases/100 000), or one in approximately 400
individuals in the community. The range of left heart diseases
was broad, most commonly ischaemic and non-ischaemic
cardiomyopathies and valvular heart disease.
PHT from respiratory disease affected 37 cases/100 000
population. PAH accounts for a very small percentage of our
patients (15 cases/100 000 population). The indicative preva￾lence of iPAH was 4.8 cases/100 000 population. Patients with
PAH were older than the general population, but younger than
those with other forms of PHT and there was a female
preponderance with PAH as might be expected. In addition, we
were unable to code a sufficient cause for the elevated ePASP in
15% (144 cases) of those patients identified through our search.
Patients with insufficient TR to estimate RVSP were not
included in the calculations.
Survival
Mean survival for patients with ‘all-cause’ PHT (eRVSP
>40 mm Hg) patients was 4.360.1 years from first recorded
echocardiogram (figure 2A). The cumulative survival between
each PHT subgroup (WHO groups 1e5) is shown in figure 3A.
Patients with pulmonary hypertension caused by respiratory
disease fared poorly (mean survival 4.160.3 years), similar to
those with left heart disease (4.260.1 years) and those without
an identified cause for their PHT (4.360.3 years). By contrast,
patients with PAH, most of whom were prescribed disease￾specific treatment, had the best survival (82% survival at the
conclusion of the study). We did note a significant difference
between mortality among the PAH WHO group 1 patients
(iPAH 80%, SSc/PAH 40% and congenital heart disease-associ￾ated pulmonary hypertension 85% alive at the end of the study
of censor, p¼0.025). Patients with insufficient tricuspid regur￾gitation for estimation of RVSP were not included in the anal￾ysis.
Associations with prevalent forms of pulmonary hypertension
There were independent variables (age, sex and ePASP) associ￾ated with an increased risk of mortality in this cohort (p<0.001).
The risk of death for patients with moderate pulmonary
hypertension (ePASP 50e60 mm Hg) was 1.89 (1.34 to 2.67)
compared with mild PHT. An ePASP >60 mm Hg had an
increased 3.29-fold risk of death compared with patients with an
ePASP between 40 and 50 mm Hg (p<0.001). These variables
remained consistent with Cox regression analysis (p¼0.002) (see
figure 2B). There was a significant relationship between
mortality and increasing ePASP (p<0.001) (figure 3B), with an
approximately 50% higher mortality in those with PASP
>60 mm Hg compared with those with mild PASP. Even those
with ‘mild’ pulmonary hypertension had a high mortality of
23% during the follow-up. In an unadjusted model, men
fared significantly worse than women (figure 4A, p<0.001).
Figure 4B demonstrates the survival differences for each quartile
of age, with those over age 60 having significantly increased
(p<0.0001) mortality compared with their younger
counterparts.

DISCUSSION
Using a community-based observational cohort study, we are
the first to show the lowest indicative prevalences of all forms of
PHT confirmed by a central echocardiography laboratory in
a discrete population, with 326 detected cases/100 000 inhabi￾tants of Armadale, Western Australia. PHT due to left heart
disease was common and PAH while uncommon, was more
frequently detected than previously reported. PHT-related
prognosis is poor overall. However, in our study PAH had the
best prognosis, probably owing to disease-specific treatment.
Increasing PASP and age were associated with a higher risk of
mortality.
The true prevalence of PAH is uncertain and previous esti￾mates vary from 5 to 52 cases/million population.7e11 Data from
the REVEAL registry reported low estimates of PAH prevalence
(group 1) at 12.4/million. REVEAL confirmed the changing age
demographic within populations of patients with PAH.7 A
Scottish registry examined the prevalence of PAH from two
perspectives: all admissions to hospital with PAH (1986 and
2001) for adults aged 16e65 years and patients from the Scot￾tish pulmonary vascular unit (1997e2006).9 The hospitalisation
data provided a higher prevalence of PAH (52 cases/million
population) than the data from expert centres (15e26 cases/
million population).8 9 In the French registry, the prevalence of

PAH was 15 cases/million population.9 Our indicative preva￾lence of 151 cases per million is higher than the number in these
reports. For iPAH, the prevalence reported from the French
registry is 6.5 per million, from the Scottish data 25 per million9
and from our data 48 per million. In 1991, the National Insti￾tutes of Health in the USA commissioned a national registry of
patients with PAH.11 The incidence of ‘primary’ PAH was
estimated at 1e2 cases/million population. These data are now
20 years old and it is likely that the figures quoted represent
a significant underestimate of the true incidence of iPAH.
Our figures are higher than those of previous reports and
possibly reflect the (1) community-based nature of this study;
(2) specificity associated with close, retrospective interrogation
of patient databases; (3) possible earlier capture of disease before
hospital presentation and (4) unrestricted age allowed in our
study compared with the Scottish Registry. Previous reports
have assessed prevalence using patient referrals to specialist
centres8 and thus probably underestimate the true prevalence of
PAH within the community. Awareness and recognition of the
earlier phases of PAH is low among doctors, with delays in
diagnosis reported to be between 2.8 and 3.8 years.10 21 The wide
range in the reported prevalence of PAH is probably due to
differences in the methods, the criteria used to make a diagnosis
and to differences in the selected patient populations.
In our study, we have shown the high detection of cases of
more common forms of PHT (groups 2e5). Comparative
epidemiology data on all forms of PHT are not available. Our
study is therefore the first to document estimated cumulative
indicative prevalence for all PHT subtypes from a community￾based echocardiography population. PHT is present in up to 70%
of those with severe left ventricular systolic/diastolic dysfunc￾tion,2 and PAP incrementally predicts death in patients with
heart failure.22 In patient populations with respiratory condi￾tions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, PHT may
affect up to 50%.2 The prevalence of chronic thromboembolic
pulmonary hypertension is unclear, with reports ranging from
0.5% to 3.8% in those with acute pulmonary embolism and can
occur without previous embolic clinical events.2 Clearly, PHT in
all its forms is a clinical feature of many diseases. We therefore
highlight the need for increased vigilance and research in all PHT
subtypes and beyond a strong focus on PAH.
We report median mortality (from first pressure estimation) of
just over 4 years with varying (borderline significance) survival
among different PHT subtypes. Median time to death was
similar between patients with PHT due to respiratory disease,
left heart disease or unknown cause (all around 4 years). Inter￾estingly, those with PAH (group 1) who had been exposed to
modern PAH-specific treatment had the highest median survival
times (around 5 years), an improvement compared with histor￾ical NIH data.11
A large community-based population study recently described
small age-related increases in PASP and the marked relationship
between increasing PASP and mortality (unadjusted HR¼4.65
per 10 mm Hg; p<0.001). This is striking given nearly all of the
patients, aged 45e96 years, had a ‘normal’ PASP of <40 mm Hg
at any time during that study.23 This was a referred cohort and
not a random sample of the population. However, consistent
with the Olmstead County data, we found increasing mortality
with higher PASP, regardless of cause.
Our study identifies a large group of patients with PHT with
no obvious underlying cause from available data. While clearly
a cause must exist, this substantive group of patients need
further investigation. These data are similar to those from an
Italian report of echocardiography-evaluated patients who had an
increase in TR velocity > 3m/s, of whom 10.05% were identified
with no known cause of the PHT compared with our 15%.20 The
indicative PHT rate of 326 cases per 100 000 from our study is
likely to be the minimum population prevalence, since patients
with PHT of unknown cause were not included in the calcula￾tions. In addition, patients with insufficient TR to estimate
RVSP might have had PHT, but were not included in the analysis.
We cannot determine from our data the number of individuals
with PHT but insufficient TR to measure RVSP. Some individuals
with PHT in the community might not yet have had echocar￾diography, or had echocardiography performed outside our
catchment area and thus were not included in our analysis.

These data emphasise that PHT (or an elevated ePASP) is not
a diagnosis in itself and requires thorough assessment to
determine its cause. Doppler echocardiography is a reliable
means of assessing PASP non-invasively and, correlates well
with RHC24e28 and is the most widely used screening tool for
PAH.2 29 Only after investigation for other causes and use of
RHC, can PAH be diagnosed. This is particularly important
since treatment may alter the long-term outcomes for these
patients.30e36
This study has a number of limitations. This is a retro￾spective cohort surveillance study and data on the indicative
prevalence of PHTare based on the records of one large specialist
centre obtaining the echocardiograms included in this
study. More definitive data on the population prevalence would
require prospective screening of a large number of individuals
from the community being studied. Echocardiography is an
imperfect tool for estimating the true PASP, with a recent meta￾analysis37 correlating ePASP only modestly with RHC. Correla￾tion with RHC-derived PASP may be improved by
only accepting well-aligned TR velocities with a complete
Doppler envelope, as was our practice in this study. Further, we
have shown a strong association between the degree of echo￾derived PASP estimation and mortality and good agreement
between our echo data and those patients receiving RHC in our
study.
There was a large group (15%) of patients in whom the cause
of PHT was not known. Further, where there was insufficient
tricuspid regurgitation to estimate the PAP, it is possible PHT
might be present, but undiagnosed. Therefore, there may be
a selection bias towards under-reporting of the true population
prevalence of PHT in this study. Indeed, assuming the same
background prevalence of PHT in this group as we found in the
group with measurable TRV, the population prevalence of PHT
may be closer to 430/100 000 individuals. Conversely, the lack of
tricuspid regurgitation may reflect a lower prevalence of PHT in
this population and improved methods of detection of PHT,
without reliance on tricuspid regurgitation, are needed in the
future. In order to calculate the ‘indicative’ prevalence of PHT
we used a conservative approach by adopting a denominator
that included a much wider catchment area than Armadale
alone, reflecting the regions serviced by our echocardiography
laboratory. We acknowledge that using a cut-off point of PASP
$40 mm Hg has the potential to miss mild to moderate PHT.
However, previous work by Mukerjee et al showed that 97% of
patients with PAH have a Doppler echocardiographic PASP
$45 mm Hg, and a threshold of <40 mm Hg versus
$40 mm Hg has a positive predictive value of 92% and negative
predictive values of 44%.28
In summary, this is the first study to assess the ‘indicative’
prevalence of all forms of PHT in a community-based echo￾cardiology laboratory. Using a retrospective database review of
all patients undergoing Doppler echocardiographic measures
with an elevated PASP ($40 mm Hg), we found that PHT is
a common and dangerous disease. The estimated minimum
prevalence of all forms of PHT in this community was 326
cases/100 000 population and for PAH specifically (group 1)
the minimum prevalence was 15/100 000 population. We
found the estimated median survival in this population to be
about 4 years. Identification of the underlying cause may
trigger disease-specific treatment, with significant prognostic
implications. Confirmation of our data requires further
prospective population-based research in addition to more
detailed prospective national or international all-cause PHT
registries.
