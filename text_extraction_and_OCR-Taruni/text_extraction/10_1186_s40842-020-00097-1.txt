Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and type 2
diabetes: where do Diabetologists stand?
Shaheen Tomah1,2* , Naim Alkhouri3 and Osama Hamdy1,2
Abstract
Background: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease worldwide. The
increasing prevalence of NAFLD mirrors that of obesity and type 2 diabetes over the last two decades.
Main: In a two-way pathophysiologic relationship, NAFLD increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, while the
latter promotes the progression of simple fatty liver to a more advanced form called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
NASH increases the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which may require liver transplantation. With the
absence of FDA-approved medications for NAFLD treatment, lifestyle intervention remains the only therapy. Lately,
extensive research efforts have been aimed at modifying NASH fibrosis and developing noninvasive screening methods.
Conclusion: We highlight the pathophysiologic relationships between NAFLD and type 2 diabetes, discuss disease
recognition, models of care, and current and emerging therapies for NASH treatment.

Background
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an umbrella
term that encompasses multiple progressive liver disorders,
ranging from simple hepatic steatosis, often called nonalco￾holic fatty liver (NAFL), to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH) which is marked by hepatocyte inflammation and
ballooning. Around 35% of NASH cases progress to liver fi￾brosis [1] and potentially to end-stage liver disease or hepa￾tocellular carcinoma (HCC) [2, 3]. The growing epidemic
of NAFLD in western societies is estimated to affect around
20 to 30% of the overall population and 45 to 75% of pa￾tients with type 2 diabetes [4, 5]. Over the last two decades,
the high prevalence rates of NAFLD have been paralleling
the rapidly progressing epidemic of obesity and type 2 dia￾betes [6, 7]. In fact, we see NAFLD and type 2 diabetes at
the intersection of similar risk factors, epidemiology, and
pathophysiology [8–10]. In terms of precedence, the recog￾nition of NAFLD as a major chronic disease is relatively
new compared to type 2 diabetes [11]. This is also evident
in medical literature over the past 40 years (Fig. 1). Cur￾rently, NAFLD is considered the most common chronic
liver disease worldwide and a leading etiology of liver dis￾eases among adults awaiting liver transplantation in the US
[5, 12–14]. The co-existence of NAFLD and type 2 diabetes
significantly increases the likelihood of developing NASH
and cirrhosis compared to the presence of NAFLD without
persistent hyperglycemia [10]. The involvement of NAFLD
as an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease
(CVD) events remains debatable [2, 15, 16]. Interestingly,
the highest mortality in NAFLD is attributed not to end￾stage liver disease, or risk of HCC, but to worse CVD risk
profile [17] possibly driven by the comorbidity of type 2
diabetes and other established CVD risk factors [15].
Hence, increased risk of CVD in patients with type 2 dia￾betes and NAFLD may exert significant impact on their
mortality. With recent advances in NAFLD diagnosis and
many phase III trials for NASH-specific therapies, there is

an essential evolving role for diabetologists in identifying
patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for NAFLD com￾plications and initiating an integrated multidisciplinary plan
of care to achieve the best possible results.
In this review, we highlight the pathophysiologic relation￾ships between NAFLD and type 2 diabetes, discuss disease
recognition, current therapeutic options, and summarize
emerging novel therapies for NASH treatment.
Main text
Pathogenesis of NAFLD in relation to type 2 diabetes
The pathogenesis of NAFLD has not been fully unraveled.
Footprints of insulin resistance (IR) with associated subclin￾ical inflammation is one of many that were recognized in
the course of NAFLD. In this pro-inflammatory state, an in￾creased influx of free fatty acids (FFAs) to the liver causes
fatty infiltration in the hepatocytes, which induces liver
damage via lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial dysfunc￾tion [18, 19]. Another important source of fatty acids and
intrahepatic triglycerides in patients with NAFLD is de
novo lipogenesis (DNL), even under fasting conditions,
compared to obese patients without NAFLD [20]. Further￾more, obesity per se through adipose tissue inflammation
and increased importation of FFAs to the liver has also
been considered an important cause of hepatocellular injury
[21]. Beyond obesity, chronic glucotoxicity aggravated by
persistent hyperglycemia is a key phenomenon observed in
the course of type 2 diabetes [22]. Glucotoxicity may pro￾mote the progression of NASH via glucose-induced IR, in￾creased DNL, and hepatocellular dysfunction [23]. On the
other hand, a recent animal study showed that dietary fruc￾tose, but not glucose, impaired fat metabolism via changes
in mitochondrial morphology and function when added to
a high-fat diet [24]. Many other factors are involved in the
pathogenesis of NAFLD comprising mechanisms in the
gut, adipose tissue, and liver (Fig. 2). These are often re￾ferred to in the literature as the gut-fat-liver axis [25]. Re￾cent advances in multi-omics studies with gut microbiota
profiling showed that increased metabolic endotoxemia due
to high gut permeability is closely tied to the development
and progression of NAFLD [26]. These consecutive or
somewhat parallel mechanisms promote cell stress and
apoptotic pathways. In NASH, Lipotoxicity-induced hep￾atocyte ballooning leads to downregulation of a key player
in the apoptotic pathway, which is caspase 9, and along
with reinforcement from a hedgehog autocrine survival sig￾naling pathway produces an “undead hepatocyte” in which
apoptosis has been initiated but fails to be executed driving
a vicious pathway of inflammation (NASH) and fibrosis
[27]. Among all the histologic features of NASH, fibrosis is
the most important predictor of end-stage liver disease and
increased mortality [28]. Obesity, metabolic endotoxe￾mia, and IR are all hallmarks of the metabolic syn￾drome (MetS) and type 2 diabetes [29–31]. Now that
NAFLD is considered by many as the hepatic mani￾festation of the MetS, the magnitude of the problem
can be better appreciated [32, 33].
Disease recognition
The diagnosis of NAFLD could be missed due to the
lack of cost-effective, non-invasive diagnostic tools, and
the absence of a clear consensus on the value of screen￾ing for NAFLD [2, 34–36]. A recent large-scale study re￾ported a significant gap in diagnosing NAFLD based on

primary-care records of almost 18 million adults from
the UK, Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands [37]. This
mandates a multidisciplinary approach aimed to identify
patients at risk for developing the advanced form of the
disease and accelerate the advancement of research to
explore new targets for therapy and reliable serum-based
biomarkers. Although it is well-established that patients
with type 2 diabetes are at a substantially increased risk
for NAFLD complications, patients with type 1 diabetes
who are overweight or obese may not be immune. Cur￾rently, around 50% of patients with type 1 diabetes have
weight problems; a condition frequently named double￾diabetes [38, 39]. Despite these concerns, it is still de￾bated whether to screen patients with diabetes for
NAFLD or not [2, 35].
NASH as a complication of type 2 diabetes
The relationship between NAFLD and type 2 diabetes is
bidirectional [6, 40]. Diabetes promotes the progression
of NAFL to NASH and increases the risk of cirrhosis
and HCC. On the other hand, NAFLD is associated with
an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes [8–10].
In 1980, Ludwig et al. coined the term “nonalcoholic
steatohepatitis” after reporting a case-series of 20 patients
with liver histology characterized by fat accumulation and
hepatic necroinflammation in the absence of excessive al￾cohol consumption [41]. Thus, the current terminology of
“nonalcoholic fatty liver disease” is mainly derived from
excluding alcohol-related heptopathology, focusing on
what “does not” lead to this type of fatty liver rather than
what “may lead to it.” This is mainly due to knowledge
gaps in understanding the natural history of NAFLD,
which also poses an obstacle to developing a clear ap￾proach to the care of patients with co-existing type 2 dia￾betes [42]. Furthermore, the inclusion of NAFLD among
diabetes-related complications is a matter of debate, which
is unlikely to be resolved without mechanistic studies that
evaluate the relationship between both diseases. Moreover,
a discussion about how to define NAFLD in the presence
of a pre-existing type 2 diabetes is needed [43]. What is
agreed on is that both conditions are related to obesity,
subclinical inflammation, and insulin resistance, but the
sequence of events is poorly identified.
Noninvasive assessment of NAFLD
The standards of care of the American Diabetes Associ￾ation (ADA) recommend evaluating patients with type 2
diabetes or pre-diabetes, who have elevated alanine ami￾notransferase (ALT) or NAFL by ultrasonography (US)
for NASH and liver fibrosis. The ADA guidelines suggest
using vibration controlled transient elastography (VCTE)
and noninvasive biomarkers for risk-stratification [44].
According to the American Association for the Study of
Liver Diseases (AASLD), the diagnosis of NAFLD is de￾fined by the presence of ≥5% hepatic steatosis either by
imaging or histology with the absence of secondary

causes of hepatic steatosis such as high alcohol con￾sumption, monogenic hereditary disorders like Wilson’s
disease or long-term use of steatogenic medications like
methotrexate, amiodarone, and tamoxifen [2]. Liver bi￾opsy remains the gold standard technique for diagnosing
NASH and liver fibrosis; however, it is invasive, carries
some intrinsic morbidity and mortality risk, may fail in
staging the disease is subject to sampling error, and has
reading variability [45].
In clinical practice, US is the recommended first-line im￾aging technique for diagnosing NAFLD; however, its sensi￾tivity is reduced when hepatic fat content is < 20–33% [46,
47]. Other non-invasive tools have been developed for diag￾nosing NAFLD. These include magnetic resonance spec￾troscopy and magnetic resonance elastography. However,
these tools are expensive, time-consuming, and are not
considered cost-effective for large-scale NAFLD screening.
In clinical research, recent data showed that magnetic res￾onance imaging–derived proton density fat fraction (MRI￾PDFF) is a reliable, non-invasive alternative to conventional
liver biopsy in assessing response to treatment in early￾phase NASH trials [48]. On the other hand, VCTE is an
imaging technology widely used at liver clinics as a simple
aid for diagnosis and follow up of patients with NAFLD
and other chronic liver diseases [49]. VCTE has the advan￾tage of evaluating a portion of the liver that is 100-fold
greater than that evaluated by needle biopsy and in much
shorter time. The generic name for VCTE is Fibroscan®
(Echosens Paris, France), which produces a quantifiable, re￾producible liver stiffness measurement (LSM) expressed in
kilopascals (kPa). A LSM value of > 9.8 kPa is consistent
with the presence of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis [50–52].
More recently, the growing interest in precision medicine
led to the development of liquid biopsy tools. These are
non-invasive, mechanism-based biomarkers that have the
potential to eventually replace conventional needle biopsy
for diagnosis, stage stratification, and monitoring of re￾sponse to treatment in NASH and other chronic liver dis￾eases [53]. Table 1 provides a summary of the most reliable
and widely used imaging modalities for NAFLD diagnosis.
Many noninvasive scores that are simply calculated
using routinely available labs and demographic data have
been developed to predict the presence of suspected
NAFLD [54, 55] including the hepatic steatosis index
(HSI) [56], and fatty liver index (FLI) [57]. Other scores
could predict the presence of advanced fibrosis (Table 2)
such as the FIB-4 index [60], NAFLD fibrosis score
(NFS) [61], the enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) score [59]
and alanine aspartate transferase (AST) to platelet ratio
(APRI) [62]. Despite their poor sensitivity in detecting
advanced fibrosis in patients with type 2 diabetes [63],
these scores (FIB-4 is among best studied) [64, 65] have
reasonable specificity and can be convenient for health￾care providers to assess patients with suspected NAFLD
based on US or elevated levels of ALT [58, 66] (Fig. 3).
It is important to recognize that patients with the
NAFLD spectrum may still present with normal ALT
levels including those with NASH, advanced fibrosis,
and cirrhosis [67]. Normal ALT levels should therefore
be taken with a grain of salt. One study proposed a
stage-based approach that uses non-invasive scores
alongside VCTE to risk-stratify patients with NAFLD
and determine when to consider liver biopsy [68]. A
more recent study by Davyduke et al. evaluated the im￾pact of a “FIB-4 first” strategy to reduce the need for
VCTE and hepatology referral [69]. Today, many investi￾gational new drugs for NASH treatment are in phase III
clinical trials, some of which might ultimately be ap￾proved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) as early as 2020.
We strongly believe that increased awareness of
NAFLD and improved disease recognition among

diabetologists would help in identifying patients with
prediabetes and diabetes who might benefit from risk
factor modification or emerging novel therapies to slow
the progression of CVD and hepatic complications.
Using validated risk scores like FIB-4 [64, 65] within
electronic health records, similar to eGFR calculation,
maybe a good initial step. In Fig. 3, we suggest an algo￾rithm to aid diabetologists and primary care providers in
screening patients with type 2 diabetes for NAFLD and
advanced fibrosis. The cost-effectiveness of screening for
NAFLD may still be debated; however, we believe pro￾active screening is better than passive waiting for fibrosis
progression.
Therapeutic approaches
Lifestyle intervention
Lifestyle intervention with diet, exercise, and behavioral
modification is the initial step in managing type 2 dia￾betes [70]. This also applies to patients with NAFLD
[71]. Steatosis can be reduced by as little as 3–5% weight
loss. On the other hand, 7–9% weight loss is typically
needed to reduce inflammation, while 10% is required to
initiate fibrosis regression [72]. Although it is widely
thought that sustainable weight loss through lifestyle
modification is often difficult to achieve, a multidiscip￾linary approach to lifestyle intervention in patients with
type 2 diabetes has been shown to induce weight loss
that is both maintainable and clinically meaningful. We
previously reported that 53% of participants in a real￾world, multidisciplinary lifestyle intervention program
who achieved an average of ≥7% weight loss at 1 year
were able to maintain up to 9% weight loss at 5 years
[73]. On the other hand, a Mediterranean eating pattern
was shown to reduce hepatic steatosis and IR independ￾ent of weight loss in insulin-resistant individuals without
diabetes but with biopsy-proven NAFLD [74]. Other
strategies to induce weight loss, such as bariatric surgery
and endoscopic bariatric procedures may be considered
in NAFLD [2, 75]. In patients with type 2 diabetes, bar￾iatric surgery was shown to reduce body weight, HbA1c,
insulin resistance, and has led to partial or complete dia￾betes remission in some cases [76, 77]. More recently,
duodenal mucosal resurfacing (DMR), a novel and min￾imally invasive endoscopic procedure, improved gly￾cemic and hepatic indices in patients with type 2
diabetes, which shows promise of possible benefits in pa￾tients with NAFLD [78]. More data are still needed re￾garding the long-term efficacy of bariatric surgery and
DMR on histologic severity and disease progression in
patients with NASH [75, 79].
Diabetes pharmacotherapy for NAFLD treatment
The dynamic association between NAFLD and hepatic
IR has led to the experimentation of several diabetes
medications for the treatment of NAFLD. These trials
generated knowledge that may support future manage￾ment paradigms for NAFLD in patients with diabetes,
but further questions need to be answered.
Metformin
An adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein
kinase (AMPK) activator; metformin is the first-line
pharmacologic treatment for prediabetes and type 2 dia￾betes. Although several randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) reported that metformin did not improve histo￾logic features of NAFLD [80, 81], metformin may lower
the risk of HCC in patients with diabetes [82]. In a re￾cent translational study that included lung biopsies of
humans with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and a
bleomycin mouse model (an experimental mouse model
of lung fibrosis), AMPK activity was lower in fibrotic foci
associated with active myofibroblasts. Moreover, the
study reported that pharmacological activation of AMPK
with metformin can reverse established fibrosis by facili￾tating deactivation and apoptosis of myofibroblasts [83].
In a more recent retrospective analysis of 191 patients
with diabetes and biopsy-proven NASH and bridging fi￾brosis or compensated cirrhosis, metformin use was
linked to lower risk of overall mortality and liver trans￾plant (HR: 0·42; 95% CI: 0·24–0·74, p = 0·003) and HCC
(sHR: 0·25; 95% CI: 0·11–0·58, p = 0·001) [84]. These
findings may pave the way for studying AMPK activators
in NAFLD, such as PXL770, which is being evaluated in
a randomized clinical trial versus placebo to assess its ef￾fects on liver fat reduction after 12 weeks of treatment
(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03763877). Metformin
should be used with caution in patients with an esti￾mated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 45 mL/min,
and possibly discontinued if eGFR drops < 30.
Glucagon-like Peptide-1 receptor agonists
The glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist lira￾glutide was studied in a recent multicenter, double-blind,
randomized, placebo-controlled phase two study in patients
with NASH (the LEAN study) [85]. NASH resolution was
observed in nine patients (39%) in the liraglutide group in
comparison to two patients (9%) in the placebo group (p =
0·019). Semaglutide, a longer-acting GLP-1 receptor agon￾ist, is currently being studied in a larger sample size of 288
patients with NASH (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:
NCT02970942). Semaglutide is also being studied in com￾bination with other medications that inhibit hepatic DNL
and affect bile acid-enterohepatic access (ClinicalTrials.gov
Identifier: NCT03987074). There is conflicting evidence on
risk of acute pancreatitis with the use of GLP-1 receptor ag￾onists [86, 87]. Patients with type 2 diabetes and NASH
should be made aware of these possible risks.
Tomah et al. Clinical Diabetes and Endocrinology (2020) 6:9 Page 6 of 11

Thiazolidinediones
In a study that randomized 247 non-diabetic patients
with NASH to either 30 mg of pioglitazone daily, 800 IU
of vitamin E daily, or placebo, pioglitazone was not su￾perior to placebo in improving histologic features of
NASH after 96 weeks of intervention. However, the
study showed that pioglitazone use was associated with
significant improvements in hepatic steatosis, ALT, and
AST compared to placebo [88]. In a more recent RCT
that randomized 101 patients with prediabetes or type 2
diabetes and biopsy-proven NASH to receive either 45
mg of pioglitazone daily or placebo for 72 weeks, 51% of
patients in the pioglitazone arm had resolution of NASH
and improvement in several histologic features, includ￾ing liver fibrosis [89]. Currently, Pioglitazone is the only
diabetes medication included in recent guidance from
the AASLD to treat patients with biopsy-proven NASH
with or without type 2 diabetes [2, 90]; however, it
should be prescribed with caution given its safety profile
(potential weight gain, and risk of bladder cancer, bone
loss, and congestive heart failure) [91].
Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors
These medications inhibit glucose reabsorption in the
proximal tubule, which leads to significant loss of glucose
and calorie in the urine, resulting in improved insulin sen￾sitivity, weight reduction, and potentially a reduction in
liver fat content [92]. Previous reports linked remogliflozin
to a 30–40% reduction in ALT levels in patients with ab￾normal baseline ALT [93]. canagliflozin [94] and dapagli￾flozin [95] also showed benefits in reducing serum
aminotransferases. In a recent RCT that randomized 50
patients with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD to receive either
standard diabetes care and empagliflozin or standard dia￾betes care only, liver fat, as measured by MRI-PDFF, de￾creased significantly in the empagliflozin arm compared
to the comparative arm [96]. Further RCTs are needed to
determine the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on liver histology
in NASH.
Treatment considerations
There is evidence, although not conclusive, that the use
of insulin and oral insulin secretagogues, including sulfo￾nylureas, may be associated with an increased risk of
HCC in patients with type 2 diabetes [97, 98] possibly
through insulin-mediated cancer cell proliferation [99].
Therefore, similar to the recent recommendation that
CVD risk reduction should be taken into account when
treating patients with type 2 diabetes, It is important to
take into consideration the risk of NAFLD progression
to HCC. When primary care providers see patients with
type 2 diabetes and NAFLD being treated with metfor￾min and glipizide, only it may be plausible to replace
glipizide with a GLP-1 or SGLT-2 agent. This is import￾ant to consider, but caution is advised.
Finally, combination therapy is projected to be the fu￾ture of NASH management, particularly in patients with
co-existing type 2 diabetes. One attracting combination
to improve NASH while reducing CVD risk may include
low-dose pioglitazone with either a GLP-1 analogue or
SGLT-2 inhibitor; however, future studies are needed to
explore the efficacy of such combination [90].
Tipping the scale-novel NASH therapies in the pipeline
The quest for a NASH-specific treatment has been har￾nessing significant attention from federal and private
funders as well as the pharmaceutical industry. As of
August 15, 2019, there were 750 NAFLD trials registered
on clinicaltrilas.gov. Earlier in 2019, results from the
STELLAR-3, a phase three, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled study which evaluated the safety and
efficacy of selonsertib, an apoptosis signal-regulating
kinase 1 (ASK1) inhibitor showed no superiority to pla￾cebo in the primary endpoint of a ≥ 1-stage histologic
improvement in fibrosis without worsening of NASH in
patients with bridging NASH-fibrosis (F3)(ClinicalTrials.
gov Identifier: NCT03053050).
The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist obeticholic
acid (OCA) is the most advanced drug in the pipeline.
FXR is a nuclear receptor with high expression in the
liver and small intestine [100]. FXR naturally binds to
bile acids [100], and they jointly regulate lipid/ glucose
homeostasis, promote insulin sensitivity, and potentially
modify liver fibrosis [101].
In phase two and three trials in patients with NASH
and advanced fibrosis, OCA showed efficacy on fibrosis
regression, paving the way for potential FDA approval
by 2020 [102, 103]. In the phase 3 REGENERATE trial
(NCT02548351), that randomized patients to receive
OCA at 10 mg or 25 mg daily or placebo, the interim
analysis at 18 months revealed significant improvement
in fibrosis by one stage in patients on OCA 25 mg daily
compared to those in the placebo arm (23·1% vs 11·9%
P = 0·0002) [103]. The fact that fibrosis improvement by
one stage occurred in less than one-quarter of patients
provides a strong rationale for the need for combination
therapy with other drugs to increase efficacy.
Multiple investigational new drugs show promising po￾tential in modifying NASH and fibrosis progression and
are now in phase 3 clinical trials (Table 3). A dual peroxi￾some proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α/δ agonist,
elfibranor regulates glucose homeostasis and lipid metab￾olism and reduces inflammation, potentially modifying fi￾brosis [104] (NCT02704403). Resmetirom, a liver-directed
thyroid hormone receptor-β agonist, increases hepatic fat
metabolism and reduces lipotoxicity, potentially improv￾ing NASH [105] (NCT03900429). Another agent in

clinical trials is aramchol, a synthetic fatty-acid/bile-acid
conjugate, which reduces hepatic fat through downregula￾tion of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1, a fatty acid synthetic
enzyme in hepatocytes. The anti-fibrotic effect of ara￾mchol stems from its upregulation of PPAR δ in hepatic
stellate cells (HSCs), the primary fibrogenic cell type in
the liver [106] (NCT04104321). Lastly, cenicriviroc, a dual
c-c chemokine receptor 2/5 antagonist which blocks intra￾hepatic macrophage trafficking and may confer anti￾fibrotic effects through de-activation of HSCc [107, 108]
(NCT03028740). These agents are currently being studied.
If any deemed effective, an expected FDA-approval in late
2020 would be looming. Future studies should explore the
efficacy of combined anti-fibrotic and anti-diabetic ther￾apy in the management of patients with type 2 diabetes
and NASH/fibrosis [90].
Conclusions
The prevalence of NASH among patients with type 2
diabetes is high, putting them at a significantly higher
risk for developing end-stage liver disease, HCC, and
CVD. Increased awareness about NASH and NASH￾related complications is warranted among diabetologists,
especially with the prospective induction of NASH￾specific therapies. We believe an interdisciplinary ap￾proach is needed for the care of patients with type 2 dia￾betes and NAFLD starting with early identification
through noninvasive biomarkers and imaging modalities
in the diabetes clinic to lifestyle modification and
NASH-specific therapy in the hepatology clinic.
