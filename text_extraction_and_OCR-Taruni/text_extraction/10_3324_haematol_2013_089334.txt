Multiple Myeloma
Introduction
The American Cancer Society estimates that there will be
approximately 22,350 new cases of and 10,710 deaths from
multiple myeloma (MM) in the United States in 2013.
1
Despite multiple treatment options, MM remains largely
incurable with median survival of approximately seven
years2 and a poor outcome for patients who have become
refractory to current treatments, with median event free and
overall survival of five and nine months, respectively.
3
Existing agents, including the proteasome inhibitor borte￾zomib and the immunomodulatory agents thalidomide and
lenalidomide, have improved outcomes in patients with
relapsed and refractory (RR) MM4,5 including increased sur￾vival rates.
6 As MM remains incurable and there is a lack of
adequate treatment for patients who have failed these agents,
MM treatments with greater efficacy and improved safety
profiles are needed, especially for patients with advanced dis￾ease.
3 Carfilzomib, a selective proteasome inhibitor, was
granted approval in 2012 in the United States for RRMM
based on efficacy results from the single-arm trial PX-171-
003-A1787,8 and combined safety data from 4 phase II studies
(PX-171-003-A0 [003-A0], PX-171-003-A1 [003-A1], PX-171-
004 [004], and PX-171-005 [005])
8 and was followed by the
approval of pomalidomide, an immunomodulatory agent, in
2013.
9 Symptoms in MM are diverse, and patients can range
from asymptomatic to severely disabled with multiple com￾plications.
10 Clinical features of active MM include hypercal￾cemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, and bone lesions, as well
as hyperviscosity, amyloidosis, and recurrent bacterial infec￾tions,
11 particularly respiratory infections, including pneumo￾nia, one of the most common causes of death in patients with
MM.
12 Symptoms and comorbidities are increased in patients
with relapsed and refractory disease, and treatment of these
late-stage patients is particularly complicated due to the
heterogeneity of the disease and patients’ characteristics.
5,13
An important consideration in RRMM is the collective side
effect profile associated with MM treatments. In particular,
bortezomib and thalidomide are each associated with toxici￾ties that may limit long-term use and/or use in selected
patients.
4,5,9,10,14 Thrombosis, for example, can be observed in
all stages of MM but there is an increased risk with
immunomodulatory drugs when combined with dexametha￾sone, as well as with the combination of melphalan and pred￾nisone.
15 Additionally, immune-mediated inflammatory dis￾eases are associated with myelosuppression.

Carfilzomib, a selective proteasome inhibitor, was approved in 2012 for the treatment of relapsed and refractory
multiple myeloma. Safety data for single-agent carfilzomib have been analyzed for 526 patients with advanced
multiple myeloma who took part in one of 4 phase II studies (PX-171-003-A0, PX-171-003-A1, PX-171-004, and PX￾171-005). Overall analyses of adverse events and treatment modifications are presented, as well as specific analyses
of adverse events by organ system. Overall, the most common adverse events of any grade included fatigue (55.5%),
anemia (46.8%), and nausea (44.9%). In the grouped analyses, any grade adverse events were reported in 22.1% for
any cardiac (7.2% cardiac failure), 69.0% for any respiratory (42.2% dyspnea), and 33.1% for any grouped renal
impairment adverse event (24.1% increased serum creatinine). The most common non-hematologic adverse events
were generally Grade 1 or 2 in severity, while Grade 3/4 adverse events were primarily hematologic and mostly
reversible. There was no evidence of cumulative bone marrow suppression, either neutropenia or thrombocytopenia,
and febrile neutropenia occurred infrequently (1.1%). Notably, the incidence of peripheral neuropathy was low
overall (13.9%), including patients with baseline peripheral neuropathy (12.7%). Additionally, the incidence of
discontinuations or dose reductions attributable to adverse events was low. These data demonstrate that single-agent
carfilzomib has an acceptable safety profile in heavily pre-treated patients with relapsed/refractory multiple
myeloma. The tolerable safety profile allows for administration of full-dose carfilzomib, both for extended periods
and in a wide spectrum of patients with advanced multiple myeloma, including those with pre-existing comor￾bidities.
ABSTRACT

pression including thrombocytopenia, and dose-limiting
peripheral neuropathy (PN) (up to 30% Grade 1/2 and 7-
15% Grade 3/4). The PN often leads to discontinuation,
and can be debilitating and occasionally irreversible.
19-21
Thalidomide is even more strongly implicated in PN,
22
and
a recent analysis of patients with newly diagnosed MM
revealed that although thalidomide improved efficacy
when added to melphalan-prednisone, it negatively
impacted safety.
23 Maintenance therapy, as well as consol￾idation strategies, with many of these drugs are being
investigated as important ways to improve and prolong
responses in patients with MM,
24 and these extended
treatment periods may draw increased attention to tolera￾bility and cumulative toxicities when considering long￾term treatment options.
Carfilzomib was initially evaluated in 2 phase I studies
(PX-171-00125 and PX-171-00226
) investigating two differ￾ent dosing schedules: 5 consecutive days of a 14-day cycle
and 2 consecutive days/week for 3 weeks of a 28-day
cycle). Consecutive day dosing demonstrated promising
antitumor activity. However, single-agent carfilzomib
administered using the 2 consecutive day dosing schedule
(PX-171-002) was better tolerated and was chosen for
further exploration in phase II studies. Here we present
combined safety data for single-agent carfilzomib in 526
patients with advanced MM who took part in one of the
4 phase II studies (Figure 1).
Methods
This analysis was based on 4 phase II studies, the methods of
which have been presented elsewhere: 003-A0,
27 003-A1
(NCT00511238),
7 004 (NCT00530816),
28,29 and 005
(NCT00721734).

/L; vary￾ing degrees of renal insufficiency; or be undergoing chronic
hemodialysis. Patients with pre-existing Grade 1 or 2 (without

symptomatic cardiac ischemia, conduction abnormalities uncon￾trolled by conventional intervention, or myocardial infarction
within the previous six months (3 months for 005) were excluded.
Drug administration
Carfilzomib was administered intravenously (IV) over 2-10
minutes on Days (D) 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 in 28-day cycles. To
ameliorate fever, chills, shortness of breath, and/or rigors observed
in phase I studies in a small number of patients,
26 dexamethasone
(4 mg) PO or IV was administered prior to all doses of carfilzomib
in Cycle 1, prior to all doses during the first dose escalation, and at
the discretion of the investigator in later cycles. The planned dose
regimen was 20/27 mg/m2 (starting dose of 20 mg/m2 in Cycle 1
escalating to 27 mg/m2 in Cycle 2) for all studies except 005
(15/20/27 mg/m2 in Cycles 1-3 n=50). Dose reduction guidelines
were provided for prolonged hematologic AEs (Grade 3 neutrope￾nia, Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia) and for Grade
3 or over non-hematologic toxicities. Conditions that did not
require dose reduction were: Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, and diar￾rhea; Grade 3 fatigue; alopecia of any grade; Grade 3 or higher
hyperglycemia attributed to dexamethasone (003-A1, 004, and
005).
Overall analysis
All patients who received one dose or more of carfilzomib were
included in this safety analysis. Carfilzomib exposure was ana￾lyzed using summary statistics; summaries of dose modifications,
patients’ demographics and disease characteristics, and patient dis￾position were tabulated. Safety data included incidence, severity,
duration, and outcome of AEs. AEs were coded using Medical
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 8.1 termi￾nology and graded according to the National Cancer Institute
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)
v.3.0.
31 Treatment-emergent AEs were defined as AEs that started
on or after the first day of carfilzomib administration or conditions
that were present at baseline but worsened in severity following
treatment. Treatment-related AEs included those that were possi￾bly or probably related to treatment.
Analysis of adverse events by organ system
Analyses were performed using grouped terms for hematologic,
cardiac, renal, GI, PN, pulmonary, and hepatic events based on fre￾quency and severity of AEs (Online Supplementary Methods). All
reported events of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) were analyzed
(Online Supplementary Methods). Treatment-related AEs were not
investigated for these analyses.

Results
Overall analysis
Patients’ characteristics
A total of 526 patients across all 4 phase II studies were
included in the analysis; 72.4% were Caucasian, 57.4%
were male, and the median age was 64 years (range 37-87;
Table 1). Median time from MM diagnosis to study treat￾ment was 4.8 years. Of the total population, 23.4% of
patients had known unfavorable characteristics as defined
by either cytogenetic or fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) analysis (including either t(4;14), t(14;16), deletion
(17p;13) by cytogenetics/FISH or deletion (13q;14) by
cytogenetics) based on the mSMART criteria,
32 and 29.6%
had stage III disease as according to the International
Staging System. The patient population was heavily pre￾treated with a median of 4 prior regimens. Greater than
75% of the population had received prior treatment with
both lenalidomide and bortezomib; 51.7% and 69.6% of
the population was refractory to bortezomib and
lenalidomide, respectively.
Drug exposure, dose modifications, and
discontinuations
Across the studies, patients received the following carfil￾zomib doses: 1.7% 15 mg/m2
, 2.7% 15/20 mg/m2
, 5.1%
15/20/27 mg/m2
, 37.6% 20 mg/m2
, and 52.9% 20/27
mg/m2
. The approved dose of 20/27 mg/m2 was received
by 82.7% of the patients assigned to receive that dose. A
median of 4 cycles (range 1-21) were given, and 19.0% of
patients started 12 cycles. Dose modifications due to an
AE were low with 77 of 526 (14.6%) patients requiring a
dose reduction and 119 of 526 (22.6%) requiring a dose
delay. Of patients who discontinued, 14.8% cited an AE as
the reason for discontinuation. The most common AEs
associated with discontinuation in 1% or more of patients
were CHF (1.5%), dyspnea (1.3%), acute renal failure or
increased blood creatinine (both 1.1%), and cardiac arrest
(1.0%).
General safety and tolerability
Most patients experienced a treatment-emergent AE,
regardless of relationship to study drug; the most common
AEs of any grade were fatigue (55.5%), anemia (46.8%),
and nausea (44.9%) (Table 2). The most common Grade 3
or over AEs were thrombocytopenia (23.4%), anemia
(22.4%), lymphopenia (18.1%), and pneumonia (10.5%).
Overall, Grade 3/4 non-hematologic AEs were uncommon

(<10% Grade 3 and <1% Grade 4). Excluding disease pro￾gression reported as an AE, the most common serious AEs
(SAEs) were pneumonia (9.9%), acute renal failure (4.2%),
pyrexia (3.4%), CHF (3.4%), dyspnea (2.1%), hypercal￾cemia (2.1%), and pathological fracture (2.1%). Many of
these events are also representative of progressive disease,
which confounds attribution to use of the drug or to
advanced MM.The most common AEs that were possibly
or probably related to study treatment included fatigue
(41.4%), nausea (35.2%), thrombocytopenia (28.3%), ane￾mia (26.8%), diarrhea (22.4%), and dyspnea (20.3%).
Across the 4 studies, there were 37 deaths on study or
within 30 days of last dose. Disease progression was the
primary cause of death in 24 of the 37 patients. Seven
deaths were deemed by the Investigator to be at least pos￾sibly related to carfilzomib and included: cardiac arrest
(n=2), hepatic failure (n=1), dyspnea (n=1), multi-organ
failure (n=1), cardiac disorder (n=1), and unknown (n=1).
By sponsor assessment, 5 patients (1.0%) died due to a
cardiac AE and an additional 3 patients with a primary
cause of death due to disease progression had a cardiac
component associated with their death, for a total of 8
(1.5%) cardiac-related deaths, all of which were possibly
related to carfilzomib.
Hematologic analysis
Overall, 370 patients (70.3%) experienced a hematolog￾ic AE. Across the studies, incidences of hematologic AEs
of any grade were 37.8% for thrombocytopenia, 25.9%
for lymphopenia, 22.6% for neutropenia, and 46.8% for
anemia. Less than or equal to 1.1% of patients required a
dose reduction or discontinuation for any of the 4 hema￾tologic AE groupings analyzed. Median platelet counts
decreased, reaching a Grade less than 1 nadir at Day 8, and
returned to normal by Day 1 of the next cycle. There was
no evidence of cumulative thrombocytopenia (Online
Supplementary Table S1), and clinically significant episodes
of bleeding associated with concurrent thrombocytopenia
were rare being 33 incidences in 28 patients: 25 Grade 1, 4
Grade 2, and 4 Grade 3. It was uncommon (7 of 187
patients, 3.7%) for patients with normal neutrophil counts
at baseline to shift to Grade 3/4 neutropenia (Table 3).
Febrile neutropenia occurred infrequently: 6 patients
(1.1%) reported febrile neutropenia. Hemoglobin
remained stable throughout the cycle, with mean and
median nadirs remaining at Grade 1.
Non-hematologic analysis by organ system
Peripheral neuropathy
The majority of patients (84.8%) had a prior history of
PN (Table 4). Of these, 42.6% were attributed to borte￾zomib and 43.3% to thalidomide, with 25.9% and 21.1%
resulting in prior therapy discontinuations, respectively.
Overall, 47.1% of patients had discontinued a previous
treatment due to PN. At baseline in the carfilzomib stud￾ies, 378 (71.9%) patients had active PN (all Grades 1 or 2).
In spite of this, PN aggregate grouping AEs across all stud￾ies were reported infrequently (13.9% overall); 41 patients
(7.8%) experienced Grade 1 PN, 25 (4.8%) Grade 2 PN,
and 7 (1.3%) Grade 3 PN. No Grade 4 or over PN was
reported and all of the Grade 3 PN occurred in patients
with Grade 1 or 2 at baseline. Moreover, the majority of
the 378 patients with Grade 1 or 2 baseline PN (330 of 378,
87.3%) did not report AEs related to PN at any time on
study. One patient (0.2%) discontinued treatment due to
neuropathic pain and 4 (0.8%) required a dose reduction
due to a neuropathy AE. In addition, the majority of PN
AEs occurred before Cycle 6 (calculated as a percentage of
the actual number of patients treated in a given cycle), sug￾gesting a lack of cumulative toxicity (Online Supplementary
Table S1).
Cardiac
Overall, 73.6% of patients had a past medical history of
cardiovascular events and 70.0% had baseline cardiac risk
factors (the latter defined as a patient who reported use of
at least one cardiovascular or anti-diabetic medication
prior to study entry). Aggregated cardiac failure events
(including CHF, pulmonary edema, and decreased ejection
fraction) were reported in 38 patients (7.2%), regardless of
causality (Table 5). The overall mortality rate, including
due to disease progression, was the same (7%) in patients
who had baseline cardiac risk factors as it was for patients
without these risk factors. Any cardiac disorder AE was
reported by 22.1% of patients. Hypertension (mainly
Grade 1–2) was reported in 14.3% of patients, more than
half of whom had a history of hypertension. In response
to a cardiac-related AE, 6 patients (1.1%) had a carfil￾zomib dose reduction. Cardiac events leading to treatment
discontinuation were noted in 23 patients (4.4%) and
included CHF (1.5%), cardiac arrest (1.0%), and myocar￾dial ischemia (0.6%). The rate of cardiac AEs did not
increase in later cycles (Online Supplementary Table S1) and
cardiac disorder AEs within one day of dosing occurred in
62 patients (11.8%).
Pulmonary
The most commonly reported respiratory AEs were
dyspnea (42.2%) and cough (26.0%). The majority of dys￾pnea events were Grade 1 or Grade 2; Grade 3 events
were reported by 25 patients (4.8%), and no Grade 4 dys￾pnea events were reported. One patient (0.2%) died with
a Grade 5 event (in the setting of concurrent congestive
heart failure). Dyspnea resolved for 67.9% of patients;
60.7% did not require any change in carfilzomib therapy,
6 patients (1.1%) required dose reductions, and 7 patients

(1.3%) discontinued treatment. The rate of dyspnea did
not increase in later cycles (Online Supplementary Table S1).
Overall, 269 patients (51.1%) experienced a respiratory AE
within one day of dosing, approximately half (139
patients, 25.9%) were dyspnea. Overall, AEs in the respi￾ratory system organ class led to dose reduction in 10
patients (1.9%). Other pulmonary AEs of clinical impor￾tance included pleural effusion (4%), pulmonary hyper￾tension (2%), pulmonary embolism (1%), hemoptysis
(0.6%), and pneumonitis (0.4%). No interstitial lung dis￾ease or pulmonary fibrosis was reported. The most com￾monly reported respiratory SAE was dyspnea in 11
patients (2.1%), which resolved or stabilized in all but one
patient. At least one respiratory infection AE was report￾ed for 18.8% of patients, with pneumonia being the most
common: 67 patients (12.7%) as well as the most com￾monly reported SAE (52 patients, 9.9%). Respiratory
infection AEs were reported as the primary cause of death
in 2 patients.
Renal
At baseline, 23.8% of patients had moderate to severe
renal dysfunction (CrCl <50 mL/min) and 39.4% had mild
renal dysfunction (CrCl ≥50 to <80 mL/min). Overall,
86.8% of the 515 patients evaluable for creatinine values
did not have worsening of renal function during the course
of treatment. At least one episode of worsening renal func￾tion was reported in 68 patients (13.2%). The worsening
renal function was considered transient in 31 patients, and
median duration of the worsening was 1.4 weeks. The
remaining 37 patients (7.2% of the total population) expe￾rienced non-transient worsening, for which 8 of 37
patients discontinued treatment due to an AE related to
renal dysfunction. For all patients with worsening renal
function, the median time to first episode was 44.5 days
(approximately Cycle 2) and the incidence of first episodes
of worsening was evenly distributed over time across ear￾lier and later time points, suggesting a lack of cumulative
toxicity. Overall, 174 patients (33.1%) had at least one
grouped renal impairment AE and the most common AEs
included: increased blood creatinine (24.1%), acute renal
failure (5.3%), renal failure (3.8%), increased blood urea
(2.7%), and decreased renal CrCl (1.1%). Nearly half of
these patients (48%) experienced a renal AE in association
with disease progression. Overall, 38 patients (7.2%)
experienced Grade 3/4 grouped renal impairment AEs; 31
of those were Grade 3. Included in the Grade 3/4 grouped
renal AEs were renal failure (1.1%), acute renal failure
(4.4%), and renal impairment (0.2%). Shifts of serum cre￾atinine from normal or Grade 1 to Grade 3 or 4 ranged
from 0 to 2.2% across the phase II studies (Table 3). Of the
174 patients who reported any renal event, 50% required
no change in carfilzomib therapy, 12.1% discontinued
carfilzomib, and 10.9% required a dose reduction. Patients
discontinuing treatment included 6 patients (1.1%) each
due to a renal AE or increased serum creatinine.
Data concerning GI and hepatic AEs, TLS, and herpes
virus infection are included in the Online Supplementary
Results.
Discussion
These results demonstrate that single-agent carfilzomib
has a favorable safety profile in heavily pre-treated
patients with RRMM.
7,27-30 The most common treatment￾related AEs were both non-hematologic (fatigue and
nausea) and hematologic (thrombocytopenia and anemia),
while the most commonly reported non-hematologic AEs
were predominantly Grade 1 or 2 in severity. While Grade
3 or 4 treatment-emergent AEs occurred in 80.2% of
patients, they were primarily hematologic in nature.
Carfilzomib was tolerable as indicated by the lack of
cumulative toxicities and the low proportion of patients
who had to discontinue or reduce their dose due to an AE.
While cross-trial comparisons are inherently flawed, it is
notable that 9% of patients completed the planned borte￾zomib therapy of 8 cycles of 21 days plus 3 cycles of 35
days (1.3 mg/m2
) in the APEX trial
19 compared with 19.0%
of patients who started at least 12 28-day cycles of carfil￾zomib. Similarly, 37% of patients in the APEX trial
19 and
22% in the SUMMIT trial
33 discontinued bortezomib due
to an AE compared with 14.8% for carfilzomib. Results
from the ongoing phase III ENDEAVOR (NCT01568866)
and CLARION (NCT01818752) trials, in which patients
are being treated with either carfilzomib or bortezomib,
will provide more information on any differences
between the two proteasome inhibitors.
To further emphasize the long-term tolerability profile
of carfilzomib, patients from the phase II studies, along
with several patients from phase I studies, were able to
enter an extension study (PX-171-010) following comple￾tion of their primary study. As of June 2012, 89 patients
with MM had enrolled and the total duration of carfil￾zomib treatment (primary study + 010 study) was a medi￾an of 89 weeks with no evidence of unique or late-onset
cumulative toxicity.
34
Hematologic abnormalities, most notably anemia, are a
common comorbidity for patients with advanced-stage
MM.
10 These AEs, particularly thrombocytopenia and
neutropenia, are caused by the disease itself, occur more
commonly, and are a more serious concern following MM
treatment with other drugs, especially in combination
with alkylating agents.
35 The hematologic safety profile of
carfilzomib, particularly the lack of evidence of cumula￾tive thrombocytopenia and low rates of febrile neutrope￾nia, compares favorably with other MM therapies includ￾ing pomalidomide9,36 and bortezomib,
37 providing further
evidence of its acceptable safety profile in heavily pre￾treated patients with MM. In addition, the hematologic
AEs reported for carfilzomib were infrequently dose limit￾ing, the Grade 3/4 hematologic AEs were generally
reversible, and serious clinical sequelae were rare.
As with hematologic abnormalities, PN is common in
patients with late-stage MM. PN caused by MM has been
considered secondary to plasma cell dyscrasia or following
direct compression. PN has become a more worrisome
condition because many treatment options cause PN or
exacerbate existing PN.
22 Pre-clinically, carfilzomib is more
selective for the proteasome than bortezomib and, unlike
bortezomib, does not induce neurodegeneration in vitro via
a proteasome-independent mechanism.
38 PN due to off
target effects, has been singled out as the most significant
dose-limiting toxicity for bortezomib39 and resulted in
dose reductions in 12% and discontinuations in 5-8% of
patients in an analysis of phase II studies.
19,40 While subcu￾taneous administration of bortezomib appears to some￾what decrease the incidence of new-onset PN, without
negatively impacting efficacy, the rates of PN (38%)
reported with subcutaneous bortezomib in patients not
D. Siegel et al.
1758 haematologica | 2013; 98(11)

previously exposed to bortezomib is higher than that
noted in the carfilzomib studies presented here.
41 In the
case of thalidomide, it is estimated that 70% of patients
treated with this agent for 12 months will develop PN and
approximately 15% of patients will need to interrupt
thalidomide treatment due to PN, with incidence rates of
25-83%.
22 As noted for carfilzomib, 0.2% of patients dis￾continued due to PN and dose reductions were required in
0.8% of patients. The frequency of Grade 3 or over PN
observed with carfilzomib (1.3%) is lower than rates
reported for bortezomib (9-13%).
22 In addition, the inci￾dence of PN AEs did not increase in later treatment cycles,
supporting long-term tolerability of carfilzomib. Overall,
carfilzomib induces a low rate of new-onset PN, does not
exacerbate existing PN, and is not dose limiting, allowing
for longer duration of treatment for MM. These findings
support pre-clinical studies demonstrating selectivity of
proteasome inhibition by carfilzomib with minimal neu￾rotoxic off-target effects.
38
As with PN and hematologic abnormalities, pulmonary
complications and cardiac events are common in patients
with late-stage MM. Dyspnea can be a serious complica￾tion of both the disease itself as well as from MM treat￾ments, and is common in the treatment of MM.
9,42,43
Cardiac disease in patients with MM has been shown to
be caused by multiple comorbidities, including age-related
cardiovascular risk, chronic anemia, amyloidosis, A-V
shunt with bony lesions, hyperviscosity, and prior anthra￾cycline exposure.
44,45 While approximately 20% of patients
reported treatment-related dyspnea, the majority of
events were low grade and transient. In those cases where
dyspnea presented on the day of or the day after dosing, it
occurred more frequently in earlier cycles. Importantly,
most cases resolved without dose reduction or discontin￾uation. Identifying the etiology of this AE is somewhat
complicated due to the non-specific nature of this low￾grade, transient symptom observed on study that can be
related to a number of underlying disorders. With regard
to cardiac events, the data for carfilzomib are comparable
to results reported for current MM therapies in the RRMM
patient population.
18,19 While it is difficult to make cross￾trial comparisons, it is important to note that the rate of
cardiac failure AEs observed in these studies (7.2%) was
similar to the 5% reported for bortezomib in the APEX
trial.
43 The extent to which the cardiac events reported
here were due to patients’ baseline comorbidities, toxicity
from prior treatments, effects of MM, carfilzomib itself, or
a combination of these factors, cannot be determined in
these single-arm trials.
Renal events are another AE commonly seen in patients
with MM and are a major manifestation of MM.
10 In con￾trast to some MM therapies, renal events that occurred
following carfilzomib administration infrequently led to
dose modifications or treatment discontinuation.
46
Patients
in the carfilzomib studies who had baseline renal dysfunc￾tion, including patients on hemodialysis, received the
same carfilzomib doses as patients without renal impair￾ment at baseline. Importantly, these results are compara￾ble to what is seen with bortezomib but different from
lenalidomide and may also be different from pomalido￾mide, which is excreted renally like lenalidomide.
9,14,46,47
Although the majority of patients entered these studies
with renal dysfunction at baseline, Grade 3/4 renal AEs
were uncommon. In addition, nearly half of all renal AEs
were associated with disease progression. Worsening of
renal function from baseline was also uncommon and was
transient in almost half of those patients who experienced
it.
Adverse events less commonly associated with MM but
of clinical interest were also evaluated in this cross-study
analysis, including GI events, TLS, herpes virus infections,
and hepatic events. A discussion of the findings for these
AEs can be found in the Online Supplementary Methods.
The AE profile presented here for carfilzomib was
derived from a late-stage, heavily pre-treated patient pop￾ulation with RRMM. The patients in these studies had a
median age of 64 years, similar to the median age of
patients with MM. Comorbidities in general increase with
age, and it is suggested that the severity of comorbidities
in MM negatively affect survival outcomes in a progres￾sive manner.
48 In addition, it is important to note that
aging is associated with reduced organ function, including
renal and cardiac function.
48 Rates and causes of death
were consistent with other studies on causes of death in
MM12 and with overall survival analyses3 performed across
trials of heavily pre-treated patients with end-stage MM.
Although it is difficult to compare studies, it is important
to note that the rate of on-study deaths with carfilzomib
(7%) is comparable to the rate seen with lenalidomide in
the MM-014 study49 (10%; same on-study definition as
carfilzomib) as well as the rate seen with bortezomib in
the SUMMIT study33 (5%; on study definition of within
20 days of study end). Likewise, the proportion of on￾study deaths due to a cardiac cause in these carfilzomib
studies is similar to historical data reported in a retrospec￾tive review of more than 3000 patients with newly diag￾nosed MM.
12
Moreover, there was no difference in mortal￾ity following carfilzomib treatment between patients with
cardiac risk factors at baseline and those without cardiac
risk factors.
Overall, the results of the phase II safety analyses pre￾sented here demonstrate the general tolerability of carfil￾zomib in a large, well-characterized group of patients with
RRMM. The lack of cumulative toxicities observed in
patients treated with carfilzomib indicate the potential for
full doses of carfilzomib to be used for extended periods in
a wide spectrum of patients with advanced MM, including
those with pre-existing comorbidities (particularly PN).
The safety results presented here combined with the
robust and durable responses of carfilzomib, including
overall response rate of 23.7% and a clinical benefit rate of
37.0% in the pivotal 003-A1 study with prolonged dura￾tion of response of 7.8 and 8.3 months, respectively, and a
median overall survival of 15.6 months, indicate that
carfilzomib will help meet the current unmet medical
need of the patient population with RRMM.
