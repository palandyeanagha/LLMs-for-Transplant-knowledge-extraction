This article was a research article in the medical field concerned with patients with liver disease particularly those with liver cir￾rhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. This article tried to clarify the role of Apoptosis and the Fas system in the pathogenesis of 
these diseases. 
Background: The Fas receptor/ligand system including soluble forms is the most im￾portant apoptotic initiator in the liver. Dysregulation of this pathway may contribute 
to abnormal cell proliferation and cell death and is regarded as one of the mechanisms 
preventing the immune system from rejecting the tumor cells.
Objectives: To analyze the role of Fas system Fas/ Fas ligand (Fas/ FasL) in the multi-step 
process of hepatic fibrosis/carcinogenesis, and to use of the serum markers as possible 
candidate biomarkers for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Patients and Methods: Ninety patients were enrolled: 30 cases of chronic hepatitis C 
(CHC) without cirrhosis, 30 cases of CHC with liver cirrhosis, and 30 cases of HCC and 
hepatitis V virus (HCV) infection. Ten wedge liver biopsies, taken during laparoscopic 
cholecystectomy, were served as normal controls. Serum soluble Fas (sFas) levels were 
measured using ELISA technique; Fas and FasL proteins were detected in hepatic tissue 
by indirect Immuno-histochemical technique (IHC); electron microscopic (EM) and im￾mune electron microscopic examinations were performed for detection of Fas expres￾sion on lymphocytes.
Results: Hepatic expression of both Fas and FasL as well as expression of Fas on sepa￾rated lymphocytes were significantly increased in the diseased groups (P < 0. 01) com￾pared to the control specimens. The highest expression was noticed in CHC specimens, 
particularly with the necro-inflammatory activity and advancement of the fibrosis. The 
sFas in cirrhotic patients and HCC were significantly higher than that in normal controls 
and CHC without cirrhosis group (P < 0.01).
Conclusions: Apoptosis and the Fas system were significantly involved in the process of 
converting liver cirrhosis into hepatocellular carcinoma. Down-regulation of Fas expres￾sion, up regulation of FasL expression in hepatocytes, and elevation of serum sFas levels 
were important in tumor evasion from immune surveillance, and in hepatic carcinogen￾esis. Published by Kowsar Corp, 2012. cc 3.0.

1. Background
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects more than 170 million 
people worldwide representing a major threat to global 
public health. Most of infected patients are chronically 
infected and at risk of life-threatening complications 
such as liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC) (1). Immuno-phenotyping of intrahepatic infiltrat￾ing inflammatory cells in chronic hepatitis C patients 
showed a predominance of T lymphocytes cells, with a 
significant proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ cells, suggest￾ing that the host immune system is involved in liver dis￾ease pathogenesis (2). Hepatocyte aberrations, accumu￾lation of chromosomal damage, and possibly initiation 
of hepatic carcinogenesis are thought to initiate by con￾tinued viral replication and persistent attempt through 
a less-than-optimal immune response to eliminate HCV￾infected cells (3). The genetically altered cells that have 
undergone malignant transformation can be cleared effi￾ciently by the immune system charged with the function 
of cancer surveillance. Tumor cells survive, expand their 
populations, and metastasize by developing strategies to 
avoid clearance by the immune system (4). An attractive 
insight into mechanism of tumor escape from immune 
clearance has been provided by the identification of the 
“Death factors”, including Fas/Fas Ligand (Fas/FasL) as an 
important regulator of both apoptosis and immune func￾tion (5). Fas is a type I membrane protein which belongs 
to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family, whereas 
the FasL is a member of TNF family. The FasL binding to 
its Fas receptor triggers a cascade of well-characterized 
intracellular signaling events that ends in cell death by 
apoptosis (6). Fas receptors are widely expressed in nor￾mal and diseased tissues. It has been implicated in tumor 
progression of several cancers (7, 8). FasL is expressed 
mainly in cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) (9), immune 
privileged sites (10), and in various tumors where specific 
cytotoxic T cell clones are produced (11). FasL over-expres￾sion was found to relate to advanced stages of many tu￾mors (8, 12). Apoptosis is tightly regulated throughout 
a variety of mechanisms, one of which is postulated to 
be the production of sFas, an antagonistic decay protein 
similar to Fas, lacking exceptionally the trans-membrane 
domain. It normally binds to FasL and blocks the signal￾ing of membrane-bound form of Fas. Elaboration of sFas 
by tumor cells by alternative mRNA splicing may contrib￾ute to resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis (13). 
2. Objectives
This study was designed to assess the hepatic tissue ex￾pression of Fas/FasL and Fas expression on T lymphocytes 
using electron microscopic (EM) and immuno-electron 
microscopic (IEM) examinations as well as the circulat￾ing serum levels of sFas in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) liver 
disease; to analyze the role of these factors in the multi￾step process of fibrosis/carcinogenesis; and the possible 
use of serum markers as possible candidate biomarkers 
for early detection of HCC.
3. Patients and Methods
This study enrolled 90 chronic HCV Patients (54 males 
and 36 females, aging between 24-66 years with a mean 
age of 48.32 ± 7.65 years) admitted to the Hepatology 
and Gastroenterology Department at Theodor Bilharz 
Research Institute (TBRI). Tumor specimens were taken 
by endoscopy and surgical specimens were obtained 
from partial hepatectomies at Kasr Al Aini Hospital. They 
included 30 cases of CHC without hepatic cirrhosis, 30 
cases of CHC with hepatic cirrhosis, and 30 cases with 
HCC. Patients with liver disease of other etiologies were 
excluded. The diagnosis of cirrhotic patients was based 
on clinical history, clinical examinations, laboratory find￾ings, gastroscopy, and ultrasonography. In addition, ten 
control wedge liver biopsies were taken from age- and 
sex-matched individuals subjected to laparoscopic cho￾lecystectomy (seven males and three females, aging be￾tween 31-45 years with a mean age of 42.21 ± 4.54 years). 
Written informed consent was obtained from all partici￾pants and the TBRI local ethical committee approved the 
study. 
3.1. Sampling
Blood samples of 8 mL were collected into sterile endo￾toxin-free vacuum blood collection tubes on potassium 
EDTA. The peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMNC) 
layer was separated using Ficoll Hypaque (Seromid Bio￾chrom, Berlin, Germany) density gradient centrifugation 
and washed 3 times with Hank’s balanced salt solution 
(HBSS) without Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions (14). These cells were 
prepared for EM examination using agarose cell-block 
technique in addition to IEM examination. Other blood 
samples of 2 mL were withdrawn into plain tube and cen￾trifuged shortly after clot formation. All samples were 
stored at −70°C in aliquots and used for analysis of sFas. 
Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues from tu￾mor samples were used for immunohistochemical (IHC) 
analysis of Fas and FasL. Liver biopsies were analyzed 
according to a histological METAVIR (15) scoring system 
using two separate scores; one for necro-inflammatory 
activity (A) grading (A1: minimal activity, A2: moderate 
activity, A3: severe activity), and the other for fibrosis (F) 
staging ( scoring from F0-F4; F1 to F2: significant fibrosis, 
F3 to F4: advanced fibrosis). Routine laboratory investiga-

tions were performed, including complete haemogram 
using automated haemogram (ACT Differential, Beckman 
-Coulter, France). Liver function tests were carried out 
using commercially available kits. Circulating anti-HCV 
antibodies were detected using Murex enzyme immuno￾assay kit (Murex anti-HCV, Version V; Murex Diagnostics; 
Dartford, England). The presence of HCV-RNA in patients’ 
sera was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction 
using the Amplicor test (Roche Diagnostic Systems; Mey￾lan, France).
3.2. Immunohistochemical analysis
Avidin biotin complex (ABC) immune peroxidase tech￾nique was used to perform the immune histochemical 
reaction according to Hsu and Raine (16). Anti-human 
Fas and FasL on paraffin sections was used; dewaxed in 
xylene and hydrated in descending grades of ethanol; 
treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide in 100% methanol for 
20 min to quench the endogenous peroxidase activity; 
and microwaved at high power (700W) for 15 minutes in 
citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for antigen retrieval. Sections were 
then incubated overnight at 4°C with the following pri￾mary monoclonal antibodies: human anti-Fas and anti￾Fas ligand (purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology 
Inc.; Santa Cruz, USA) diluted at 1:100, 1:150, respectively 
in Phosphate buffer saline (PBS). Next day, after thor￾ough washing in PBS, the sections were incubated with 
streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase preformed complex us￾ing a peroxidase/DAB (3, 3’-diaminobenzidine) enzymatic 
reaction. The staining was completed by 5-10 minutes re￾sulted in a brown-colored precipitate at the antigen sites, 
counterstained in Mayer’s hematoxylin to visualize the 
cell nuclei and mounted by a cover slip using DPX mount￾ing medium. Positive and negative control slides for each 
marker were included within each session. As a negative 
control, liver tissue section was processed in the above￾mentioned sequences but the omission of the primary 
antibody and PBS were replaced. The scoring of Fas/FasL 
in liver tissue was based on intensity and extensiveness 
(by percentage of population) of the positively stained 
cells. Both parameters were scored on 0-3 scale basis as 
follows: 
1. Intensity: 0 = negative staining (-), 1 = weakly positive 
staining (+), 2 = moderately positive staining (++), and 3 
= strongly positive staining (+++),according to Chen et 
al.(17);
2. Extensiveness range: 0 = negative, 1 = positive stain￾ing in < 10% of cells, 2 = positive in 10%-50% of cells, and 
3 = positive in > 50% of cells, according to Itoi et al. (18). 
Liver sections were examined by Zeiss light microscopy 
at power X400 for both markers; the number of posi￾tively stained cells with the highest expression was semi￾quantitatively recorded within ten successive fields per 
section and the final value represents the mean. Zero per￾centage was given to unstained sections. 
3.3. Measurements of Serum sFas Levels
Serum Fas (sFas) levels were assayed using a sandwich 
enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay kit (ELISA) (Bio￾source International, Camarillo, California, USA) accord￾ing to the manufacturer’s instructions. The optical den￾sity was measured at 450 nm wavelength using an ELISA 
reader (PR 3100 TSC Microplate Reader Bio-Rad). The con￾centration of sFas in serum samples was determined from 
the standard curve. All assays were conducted in dupli￾cates, and the mean concentration of sFas was calculated. 
Electron microscopic and immuno-electron microscopic 
(IEM) examinations of peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMNCs) were done using agarose cell-block tech￾nique (19). Solidified agarose blocks of separated cells 
were refixed in buffered 4% glutaraldehyde for 1 hour, and 
then postfixed in 2% osmic acid for 1 hour, dehydrated in 
ascending alcohol, and infiltrated and embedded in ep￾oxy resin. Ultrathin sections were performed using Leica 
ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Ernst-Leitz￾Strasse, Germany). The sections were stained with ura￾nyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined using Philips 
Microscopic electron microscope 208 S (Eindhoven, The 
Netherlands). IEM examination was performed on other 
part of separated cells using rabbit polyclonal anti-Fas 
antibodies (Maixin-Bio, Fuzhou, China) as above method 
of immunohistochemical analysis, and then processed 
into agarose cell-block and prepared for EM examination 
as above.
3.4. Statistical Analysis
Statistical evaluation of results was done using SPSS 
computer program (version 12 windows). Results were 
expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or number 
(%). Comparison between the mean values of different pa￾rameters in the different groups were performed using 
one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc us￾ing the least significant difference. Correlation between 
parameters was performed using Spearman’s rank corre￾lation coefficient (r) (20). P value < 0.05 was considered 
significant and < 0.01 was considered highly significant.
4. Results
4.1. Hepatic Expression of Fas/ FasL Antigen 
Fas/FasL protein was observed in the membrane ± cy￾toplasm of hepatocytes with occasional perinuclear 
staining. In the current study, normal liver specimens 
showed faint Fas protein expression and no detectable 
FasL protein expression. Both antigens were significantly 
increased in the diseased groups (P < 0. 01) compared to 
the control specimens (Table 1, 2, and 3). In CHC, Fas was 
detected among infiltrating lymphocytes at the advanc￾ing edges of piecemeal necrosis (interface hepatitis). 
Moreover, FasL protein was expressed dominantly in the 
infiltrating mononuclear cells in portal area and hepatic

5. Discussion
Apoptosis is central for the control and elimination 
of viral infections. In chronic HCV infection, the disease 
persists in the majority of patients despite enhanced 
hepatocyte apoptosis and up-regulation of death in￾ducing ligands (21). The impact of apoptosis in chronic 
HCV infection is not well understood. It may be harmful 
by triggering liver fibrosis, or essential in interferon￾induced HCV elimination (22). In addition, escape from 
the immune surveillance may play an important role 
in tumor outgrowth and metastasis. The Fas receptor/
ligand system, including soluble forms, is the most im￾portant apoptosis initiator in the liver (23). Dysregula￾tion of this pathway may contribute to abnormal cell 
proliferation and cell death (24) and is regarded as one 
of the mechanisms that prevents the immune system to 
reject tumor cells (13). In this study, the immune histo￾chemical expression of Fas and FasL was determined us￾ing specific monoclonal antibodies. In normal liver, Fas 
was faintly expressed on cytoplasm and membranes of 
hepatocytes, while FasL was negative. This result was con￾sistent with those of Leithauser et al. (25) and Roskams et
al. (26). Data also showed the increased expression of Fas 
receptors and ligands in hepatocytes in liver specimens 
from CHC patients with and without cirrhosis, compared 
to the controls. Hepatic Fas expression was found to be 
elevated in chronic hepatitis B (27), chronic hepatitis C 
(28, 29), and acute liver failure (30). Moreover, a progres￾sive Fas and FasL increasing from CH to cirrhosis was 
also observed (31). Our results suggest that “suicide” and 
“fratricide” mechanisms proposed by Galle et al. (30) in 
the study of alcoholic liver cirrhosis may also work in 
liver cirrhosis after viral hepatitis C, and may explain the 
mechanism by which apoptosis might be involved in the 
pathogenesis of liver cirrhosis. “Fratricide” is induced by 
ligation of Fas receptor and FasL expressed on the surface 
of adjacent cells, while “suicide” is induced by binding 
of FasL expressed by hepatocytes to Fas on the surface of 
the same cells. According to METAVIR activity score sys￾tem, the up-regulation of hepatic Fas expression demon￾strated in our study in CHC patients was in accordance 
with the severity of liver inflammation. Similar results 
were obtained by Pelli et al. (32). The histological activ￾ity index (HAI) revealed more expression of Fas antigen 
in liver tissues with active inflammation than in those 
without active inflammation (33). When HCV-specific T 
cells migrate into hepatocytes and recognize the viral 
antigen via T cell receptors, they become activated and 
express FasL that can transduce the apoptotic death sig￾nal to Fas-bearing hepatocytes (30, 32). This was proved 
in our study by prominent expression of FasL protein in 
infiltrating mononuclear cells in portal area and hepatic 
sinusoids .Thus, the Fas system plays an important role in 
liver cell injury by HCV infection. Our results also demon￾strate that the expression of Fas and FasL was increased 
in the course of liver fibrosis. Several studies have dem￾onstrated the increased expression of Fas and FasL in the 
course of liver fibrosis, which is the most serious conse￾quence of chronic liver injury (28, 34, 35). Experimentally, 
the up- regulation of Fas expression occurs with stimula￾Figure 3. A) IEM photomicrograph of a immuno-peroxidase-labeled PB lymphocyte, showing over-expression of FasR alongside

tion by gamma interferon released from T cells (36). Cy￾tokines and transforming growth factor-beta1 released 
from Kupfer cells and infiltrating T lymphocytes were 
also suggested to be the causes of hepatic fibrogenesis 
accompanied with hepatocellular necrosis and inflam￾mation (28). Because hepatic fibrosis is associated with a 
high incidence of HCC, it was speculated that Fas expres￾sion might involve in the incidence of HCC (37, 38). In 
HCC liver biopsies, FasL showed cytoplasmic positivity in 
hepatocytes in areas of interface hepatitis. Strong expres￾sion of Fas as well as FasL in the hepatocytes immediately 
adjacent to HCC was a constant finding. Within the HCC 
biopsies, FasL expression was variable, but present only in 
a minority of cells. Fas varied from a diffuse honeycomb 
pattern to focal positivity in occasional cells (26). In re￾cent years, there is accumulating evidence showing that 
sFas plays an important role in modulation of apoptosis 
(29). sFas was capable of inhibiting hepatic apoptosis by 
binding to FasL or anti-Fas antibodies in competition 
with membrane-bound Fas. SFas protein, composed of an 
extra cellular region of Fas receptor and Fc sequence of 
human IgG, inhibited the activity of Cytotoxic T lynpho￾cytes (CTLs) in a dose-dependent manner (39). Midis et al. 
(40) reported that patients with non-haematopoietic ma￾lignancies exhibit elevated sFas levels compared to nor￾mal controls, and that sFas could be synthesized and re￾leased in the culture supernatants of human solid tumor 
explants. They also found that the relative elevation of 
sFas levels in non-haematopoietic cancer patients might 
be in consistence with both disease stage and tumor bur￾den. Many researchers reported that serum sFas levels in 
patients with HCC were significantly higher than that in 
healthy adults (28, 39). Judo et al. (40) also reported that 
sFas levels was related to the number of tumor nodules, 
but not to the size of solitary nodule. In patients with 
solitary HCC nodule, serum sFas levels fell rapidly after 
surgical resection and went undetectable in one week. 
This evidence suggested that sFas was generated by tu￾mor cells, or at least it was tumor-related. sFas mediated 
a prereceptorial resistance of Fas-expressing hepatocytes 
by antagonizing FasL killing effect of infiltrating CTLs. 
Thus, Fas-bearing tumor cells were saved by sFas from 
the fate of apoptosis and escape from the immune sur￾veillance. Our data revealed significantly higher serum 
sFas levels in HCC patients than those in healthy adults, 
but showed no significant difference between the levels 
in HCC and cirrhotic patients. This phenomenon may be 
due to relatively high expression of FasL in HCC cells; sFas 
cleaved by metalloproteinases from trans-membrane do￾main might be capable of binding to sFas, thus accuracy 
of the measurement was influenced. A linear correspon￾dence between liver tissue expression and serum levels 
of sFas was also detected. In conclusion, apoptosis and 
Fas system were significantly involved in the process of 
converting liver cirrhosis into hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Down-regulation of Fas expression, up-regulation of 
FasL expression in hepatocytes, and elevation of serum 
sFas levels were important in tumor evasion from im￾mune surveillance and in hepatic carcinogenesis, and 
therefore, warranted and drawn the attention to the use 
of these components of the Fas system as attractive tar￾gets for anticancer therapy. In addition, the linear cor￾respondence between liver tissue expression of Fas and 
its serum levels suggests that they could be considered as 
predictive markers for tumorigenesis in HCC.
