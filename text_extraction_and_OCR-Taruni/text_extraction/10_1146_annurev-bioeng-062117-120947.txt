Abstract
Metastasis contributes to poor prognosis in many types of cancer and is the
leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Tumor cells metastasize to distant
sites via the circulatory and lymphatic systems. In this review, we discuss
the potential of circulating tumor cells for diagnosis and describe the exper￾imental therapeutics that aim to target these disseminating cancer cells. We
discuss the advantages and limitations of such strategies and how they may
lead to the development of the next generation of antimetastasis treatments.

1. INTRODUCTION
Early diagnosis in most types of cancer remains challenging due to the lack of symptoms in
the early stage and the small size of the primary tumor. For instance, mammography, the most
common screening tool for the detection of early-stage breast cancers, can detect on average
80–90% of breast cancers at an early stage in women without symptoms, and reduces the risk
of death by 15% in all women screened. Mammography is a somewhat accurate screening tool,
but the rate of false negatives remains around 20% and the rate of false positives is more than
30% (1). Mammography also detects indolent localized cancers that may not require treatment
(2). In studies of early detection of lung cancer, computed tomography (CT) reduces mortality by
7–20% but has a low screening accuracy (96% false positive) (3). Moreover, the radiation from
CT scans gives rise to long-term risk for some cancers (4). In another example, prostate-specific
antigen (PSA) has been used for the early detection of prostate cancer, but the overdiagnosis rate
and whether it contributes to a reduction in deaths remain unknown (5).
Before cancer metastasizes, cancer cells are disseminated from the primary tumor site to remote
sites via blood circulation (Figure 1). Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) were first discovered in 1869
during an autopsy of a metastatic cancer patient by Ashworth (6), who observed that the cancer
cells in a site distant from the tumor resembled the original tumor. This observation implied that
in order for the cancer cells to have reached the distant site, they would have had to be transported
there through the blood. Ever since, CTCs have been considered an important factor in metastasis
and a primary cause of deaths attributable to cancer.
Metastasis can be described as a five-step process (Figure 1): (a) Cancer cells detach from
the primary tumor, (b) invade the blood circulation, (c) survive in circulation, (d ) extravasate into
distant organs, and (e) proliferate at the secondary site(s). CTCs found in the peripheral blood
of cancer patients often indicate metastasis (7, 8). CTCs have clinical potential as prognostic
biomarkers to predict treatment efficacy, progression-free survival, and overall survival in patients
(9–13). There is increasing evidence that CTCs that entered the circulation could be a good
surrogate biomarker not only for prognosis but also for detection and monitoring of disease (8,

9, 14–17). The potential use of CTCs in many research areas has acquired great momentum in
recent years. Developments include the selection of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy, detection
of recurrent disease, examination of pharmacodynamic biomarkers, and identification of novel
therapeutic targets, enabling a personalized therapeutic approach (12, 13, 18, 19, 20, 21).
Compared with traditional tissue biopsy, which is an invasive procedure and presents a static
“snapshot” of the tumor, liquid biopsy involving CTC and/or circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)
analyses is noninvasive and can provide real-time information about the disease burden, the evo￾lution of the tumor, and the tumor’s heterogeneity (22). More specifically, CTCs contain in￾formation related to the initiation of metastasis, whereas ctDNA is more representative of the
bulk of the metastatic tumor (22). Although intratumor heterogeneity is widely recognized as a
primary way to reduce the effectiveness of molecular targeted therapy, thorough investigation of
such heterogeneity remains challenging due to the difficulty of performing multiple tissue biop￾sies to acquire spatial and temporal samples (23). The molecular and genetic profiling of CTCs
represents a possible alternative to study tumor subpopulations during disease progression and to
monitor changes in response to therapy.
CTCs are strong prognostic and diagnostic factors because they are present in early disease
progression (24). Several studies have detected CTCs in blood in early-stage cancer. For example,
Stott et al. (17) detected CTCs in patients with localized prostate cancer, Zhang et al. (25) extracted
CTCs from patients with early-stage lung cancer, and Murlidhar et al. (26) showed the presence
of CTCs in early-stage lung cancer not only in peripheral blood but also in pulmonary veins.

CTC enumeration is a powerful tool in early screening, monitoring of disease progression and
treatment, and indication of cancer relapse (27). CTCs also have great potential to provide clinical
and therapeutic information when combined with downstream analysis (27). Some studies have
suggested that CTC enumeration alone is not sufficient to guide therapeutic decisions (28) but
that molecular analysis of CTCs should be performed to determine how to target therapy (29).
Mutations in genes such as KRAS, EGFR, and HER2 and in the estrogen receptor (ER) genes can
be identified through the screening of CTCs (30). The differences between individual CTCs and
the primary tumor may enable new insights through the comparison of CTC genomes with those
of the primary and metastatic tumors (27). RNA profiling or sequencing on single or pooled CTCs
can provide extensive information to identify signaling pathways and splice variants relevant to
metastatic potential and therapy resistance (31). Ex vivo culture of patient-derived CTCs can be
adopted in tests of drug efficacy (32) and can enable multiplexed proteomic analyses of CTCs (33).
The main challenge in the study of CTCs is posed by their extreme rarity: They represent
as few as one cell per 109 hematologic cells in the blood of patients with metastatic cancer (15).
The plasticity and phenotypic alterations of CTCs further hamper the detection and isolation
of these cells (27). A given isolation technology can therefore be characterized through four
parameters: recovery, purity, throughput, and clinical relevance. CTC recovery indicates the
ability of a technology to enumerate CTCs. Sample purity determines whether further downstream
analysis can be performed. Throughput indicates the volume of blood sample that can be processed
and constrains the overall number of CTCs that can be recovered. Clinical relevance refers to the
biological and therapeutic information that can be obtained from the isolated CTCs. An optimal
technology would have high CTC recovery and purity, high throughput for sample processing, and
the ability to retain heterogeneous CTC populations for further downstream analysis to provide
clinical suggestions.
In the following sections, we categorize CTC isolation technologies on the basis of the ap￾proaches adopted. We briefly describe each category with examples of relevant studies, and com￾pare the technologies in terms of their performance and potential beyond enumeration.
2. CIRCULATING TUMOR CELL ISOLATION TECHNOLOGIES
2.1. CellSearchTM
CellSearchTM is the first and so far the only CTC assay approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration for clinical use in patients with metastatic breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer
(24). CellSearch can correlate the number of isolated CTCs with prognosis (34), thereby showing
reduced progression-free survival and overall survival for patients with metastatic cancer who have
five or more CTCs (breast and prostate cancers) or three or more CTCs (colorectal cancer) per
7.5 mL blood (35–37). A blood sample is collected in a CellSaveTM tube to be preserved for up to
96 h, then preprocessed with Ficoll centrifugation for removal of red blood cells (RBCs) by density
gradient. CTCs in the buffy coat are magnetically labeled with Ferrofluid, which is a suspension
of antibody-coated magnetic nanoparticles, then extracted through the application of a magnetic
field. The extracted CTCs are immunostained against cytokeratin, CD45, and 4
,6-diamidino-2-
phenylindole (DAPI), then imaged with fluorescence microscopy for identification.
CellSearch offers recovery rates of 12% in a cell line with low levels of epithelial cell adhesion
molecule (EpCAM) expression (MDA-MB-231), 44% in a cell line with moderate levels of Ep￾CAM expression (BT20), and more than 75% in cell lines with high levels of EpCAM expression
(T47D and SKBR3) (8). The rate of CTC recovery in clinical samples is much lower, whereas
other technologies demonstrate orders-of-magnitude-higher numbers of CTCs recovered. The

BE20CH14_Nagrath-King ARI 29 April 2018 11:32
monitoring of mesenchymal CTCs remains challenging, as CellSearch demonstrates an even lower
recovery rate (2%) for mesenchymal breast cancer cell lines (38). OB-Cadherin has been proposed
as a potential mesenchymal marker to capture cells undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal tran￾sition (39, 40). Further analysis using CellSearch has also been limited due to low sample purity
(0.01–0.1%) (41).
2.2. Affinity-Based Microfluidic Devices
The CTC chip, developed in 2007 by Nagrath et. al (15), is the first immunocapture microfluidic
technology. This polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based device consists of 78,000 microposts coated
with antibodies against EpCAM, enabling the capturing of CTCs expressing the antigen through
a one-step process that does not require prelabeling or processing of whole-blood samples. The
CTC chip offers a throughput of 1 mL/h, a CTC recovery rate of 74–80% among cell lines with
different levels of EpCAM expression, and purity of 50%. CTCs have been identified in more
than 99% (115 out of 116) patient samples from lung, prostate, pancreatic, breast, and colon
tumors.
The geometrically enhanced differential immunocapture (GEDI) chip also employs microposts
but with enhanced geometry to maximize CTC–wall interactions. The GEDI chip contains 5,000
silicon microposts coated with anti–prostate-specific membrane antigen antibodies (10). The mi￾croposts in each row are staggered to enhance contact between larger cells and the microposts.
The geometry of the microposts increases the sample’s purity in comparison to the CTC chip as
a result of a reduction in the number of collisions between smaller cells and the microposts. The
GEDI chip offers a throughput of 1 mL/h, a recovery rate of 85% in blood against LNCaP cells,
and purity of 68%.
The herringbone chip (HB chip) uses a structure other than microposts—namely staggered
herringbone grooves—to create microvortices and lateral movement (17). In the HB chip, CTCs
are passively mixed through secondary flows and therefore have a greater chance of interacting
with the antibody-coated PDMS surface. The HB chip offers a higher rate of CTC recovery (92%
against PC3 cells in blood) than that of the CTC chip due to the higher encounter rate between
cells and the surfaces, but it yields lower sample purity (14%) due to the same effect.
The graphene oxide chip (GO chip) eliminates geometrical structures but incorporates nano￾materials to achieve CTC capture. The GO chip uses antibody-coated nanosheets on a flat surface
made of silicon substrate and takes advantage of the nanomaterial’s high ratio of surface area to
volume for sensitive capture of CTCs (42). The GO chip has 59,000 flower-shaped gold patterns
that absorb nanosheets to be functionalized with EpCAM. The GO chip can operate at a higher
flow rate (3 mL/h) while offering a similar rate of recovery (more than 82.3%) compared with
those of the CTC chip.
Due to their high sensitivity and specificity, microfluidics-based CTC isolation methods have
been widely adopted in both basic and clinical studies. However, the potential of these methods
is limited due to their low throughput and inability to retrieve heterogeneous populations of
CTCs. Moreover, efficient release of CTCs from captured substrates remains an active area of
investigation, obstructing downstream studies of isolated CTCs.
2.3. Filtration
Isolation by size of epithelial tumor cells (ISET) is one of the first modern filtration approaches
to CTC purification (43). A blood sample is fixed with paraformaldehyde to eliminate cell de￾formability for better recovery through polycarbonate (PC) membranes. The PC membranes are

track-etched to create calibrated 8-µm-diameter cylindrical pores. The preprocessed blood sample
is aspirated through the membranes under vacuum, trapping CTCs in the pores and allowing the
rest of the blood cells to freely pass. The cells on the membranes are then washed with buffer and
subjected to immunostaining for CTC identification. The CTC recovery rate in clinical samples
is similar to that of CellSearch, with variation depending on the type of cancer (44). The main
challenge of ISET involves cells clogging the membranes. In order to avoid randomized pore
overlapping during fabrication, the porosity of the PC membranes is kept low (<2%) so that the
CTCs are not lost through fused pores (45). Because of the membranes’ low porosity, they are
easily clogged by the abundant blood cells occupying the pores.
More recent filtration approaches have employed microfabrication and different materials to
overcome the limitations of traditional track-etched PC membranes. For example, the parylene
C microfilter reported by Zheng et al. (46) contains 16,000 embedded filter pores (5.6–12.6%
porosity) to achieve a recovery rate of 89%, 6 log purification, and a throughput of 7.5 mL in
10 min. Zheng et al. (45) later created a 3D microfilter that enables the enrichment of viable
cells without fixation. This 3D microfilter applies two layers of staggered parylene membranes
with pores (7.0–14.5% porosity), allowing CTCs to rest on the second layer below the pores of
the first layer. The device reduces stress on the cell membrane and sustains cell viability during
filtration. It offers a recovery rate of 86% against unfixed MCF7 cells from 1 mL of blood and 3
log purification [(4.5–11) × 106 white blood cells (WBCs) per milliliter], but has a 1 mL sample
volume due to the propensity for clogging.
Overall, size-based filtration techniques offer a biomarker-independent technique for CTC
isolation, but yield low recovery and low purity compared with affinity-based approaches. Addi￾tional concerns include the low sample capacity resulting from cell clogging, cell viability, and
intermediate throughput.
2.4. Inertial-Based Size Separation
A technique introduced by Di Carlo et al. (47) involves the inertial migration of particles to achieve
high-throughput cell separation in microfluidic channels. Particles flowing through microfluidic
channels can be focused into certain designated streamlines due to the equilibrium of two inertial
lift forces: shear gradient and wall lift forces (47). Hur et al. (48) developed the Vortex Chip by using
microscale laminar vortices to retain large numbers of CTCs in assigned areas at high throughput
(0.6 mL/min) on the basis of the inertial migration of particles. CTCs are trapped by the vortices
in the side chambers at higher flow rates and are released when the vortices are discontinued at
reduced flow rates. An adapted Vortex Chip demonstrated an improved performance of 8–26%
recovery against MCF7 cells in a single device and 28–37% in double rounds (the performance
was similar in 10-fold-diluted blood or lysis blood) (49). Clinical sensitivity of 50–88% and purity
of 0.5–12.7 WBCs per milliliter (1–95% overall purity) have been reported (49, 50).
In another example, Hyun et al. (51) created a parallel multiorifice flow fractionation (p￾MOFF) device in which a series of contraction/expansion microchannels are placed parallel on a
chip to continuously isolate CTCs. The series of orifices induces stronger inertial lift forces on
CTCs because they are larger in size than WBCs, thereby moving the CTCs to the center of
the microchannels and the WBCs toward the side outlets. In this technique, a blood sample is
preprocessed with RBC lysis and diluted in buffer to a total volume of 10 mL. p-MOFF offers a
recovery rate of more than 91.6% against MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, a WBC removal rate of
90.8% (1 log), and throughput of 0.6 mL/min. In clinical samples, at least one CTC per 7.5 mL of
blood was identified in 19 of 24 (79%) patients with metastatic and adjuvant breast cancer. Thus,
inertial size-based separation has demonstrated high performance in terms of throughput and

cell recovery. Emerging techniques are addressing the issue of high purity without any negative
selection, making these approaches highly attractive.
2.5. Dean Flow Fractionation
Dean flow is secondary flow arising from the centrifugal effects characterized by counterrotating
vortices, where the flow at the center of the channel is directed outward around a curve while
the flow at the top and bottom of the channel is directed inward. The drag force generated
from Dean flow is correlated with the size of the particles and the curvature of the channel and,
therefore, moves the different-sized particles to separate equilibrium positions (47). Hou et al.
(52) reported a spiral device in which twofold-diluted blood is injected along with a sheath buffer
flow. The sheath buffer retains blood cells close to the outer wall at the inlet, and the Dean
flow circulates the blood components along the spiral channel. Because of their smaller size,
blood cells make one full Dean circulation from inlet to outlet, remaining at the position close
to the outer wall at the outlet. However, CTCs encounter stronger inertial lift forces as they
approach the inner wall that prevent them from completing a full Dean circulation, remaining at
the inner wall at the outlet. The application of a two-stage cascade spiral system improved the
purity of the sample, achieving an overall cell line recovery rate of 85%, 3 log WBC depletion,
and throughput of 3 mL/h. In clinical samples, the spiral device has demonstrated sensitivity of
100% in 20 patients with lung cancer and purity of 0.1–10% (441 ± 319.5 WBCs per milliliter).
Subsequently, Warkiani et al. introduced a slanted spiral device (53) and a multiplex spiral device
(54) to improve the throughput (7.5 mL of blood in less than 10 min) and purity (4 log WBC
depletion).
Lin et al. (55) created the Labyrinth device, which focuses both CTCs andWBCs into individual
streamlines. Smaller cells, such as WBCs, remain unfocused in most Dean flow fractionation
technologies due to the weaker lift force they encounter compared with that of CTCs. The
Labyrinth device incorporates sharp corners on top of mild curves to enhance the passive migration
of smaller cells to their equilibrium positions, achieving complete focusing of these cells. The
device offers a recovery rate of more than 90% against cell lines from breast, pancreatic, prostate,
and lung cancers; clinical sensitivity of 95% in pancreatic and breast cancer samples (72 out of
76); 4–5 log WBC depletion through two-stage double devices; and an extremely high flow rate of
2.5 mL/min. Figure 2 presents the design of a Labyrinth device along with representative images
of a breast cancer CTC isolated using this device. Overall, studies have demonstrated that these
techniques perform very well, given their high throughput, recovery rates, and purity.
2.6. Dielectrophoresis
Dielectrophoresis (DEP) exploits differences in electrical properties among distinct cells, which
depend on cell composition, morphology, and phenotype (56). In DEP, when nonuniform electric
fields are applied to electrodes of different sizes, cells shift positions either toward (pDEP) or away
from (nDEP) the source of the fields. At low ac frequencies, buffer ions accumulate on the cell
membrane and form a capacitive layer, moving the cell along with the gradient of the electric
field (nDEP). At high ac frequencies, the capacitive layer does not form, due to the swift shifting
of the field, and the concentrated electrics (in the interior of the cell) move the cell toward the
higher field (pDEP). The crossover frequency is defined as the frequency at which nDEP transits
to pDEP. Due to their larger surface area, CTCs possess a DEP crossover frequency of 20–
75 kHz (across more than 80 tumor cell lines) (57), whereas WBCs have a crossover frequency of
more than 85 kHz (58).

for cytokeratin and 4
,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and negative for CD45. Breast CTCs are shown in red, and the two
leukocytes are shown in green.
DEP separation is achieved in two ways: DEP field-flow fractionation (DEP-FFF) and DEP
trapping. ApoStreamTM employs DEP-FFF to continuously isolate CTCs. After diluted buffy
coat is infused with a sucrose sheath buffer, a frequency of 45–65 kHz is applied to attract CTCs
toward and repel WBCs from the electrodes (58). CTCs are collected through the bottom outlet
while WBCs levitate in the buffer and exit through a waste outlet. A recovery rate of ∼70% has
been observed against both epithelial and mesenchymal cell lines, along with sample purity of
∼0.3% (or ∼10,000 WBCs per milliliter) and throughput of 7.5 mL in ∼1 h.
Another commercial technology, DEPArrayTM, employs DEP trapping to manipulate cells at
the single-cell level. DEP cages are created through an array of programmable electrodes that
levitate cells through nDEP and trap them via adjacent electrodes that are in the counter phase
(59). The cells trapped in cages are characterized with immunofluorescent staining. DEPArray
is designed as a downstream tool for the recovery of single CTCs following upstream CTC
enrichment (e.g., CellSearch) (60). However, a cell loss rate of 40% has been reported during
the use of the DEPArray system (60). Although the performance of traditional DEP-based CTC
isolation is limited due to lower throughput, DEP has been proven to have great potential in
manipulating cells.
2.7. Integrated Devices
Several technologies utilize multiple concepts for CTC enumeration. The CTC iChip incor￾porates lateral displacement, inertial focusing, and immunomagnetic selection into an integrated
microfluidic system (61). Blood is first incubated with antibody-coated magnetic microbeads prior
to processing. The first phase of the iChip “debulks” the blood through deterministic lateral dis￾placement that hydrodynamically depletes cells smaller than 8 µm (e.g., monocytes, lymphocytes,
RBCs, and platelets). In the second phase, the remaining cells are aligned through a sequence
of sinusoidal channels by inertial focusing. The third phase involves a magnetic field that sepa￾rates magnetic-labeled cells from nonlabeled cells. Either positive selection using EpCAM, where

CTCs are labeled, or negative selection using CD45 and CD15, whereWBCs are labeled, could be
employed (posiChip or negiChip, respectively). posiChip has a recovery rate of 78–99% in cell lines

has a recovery rate of 95–97% regardless of EpCAM expression, but lower sample purity of
32,000 WBCs per milliliter.
Ultraspecific microfluidic devices combine inertial microfluidics and immunomagnetism, en￾abling whole-blood processing without the need for preprocessing (62). A blood sample is injected
with phosphate-buffered saline fluid buffer into an inertial sorting module to enumerate CTCs.
The CTC-enriched stream then enters a passive mixer, where it is combined with EpCAM-coated
magnetic microbeads. On-chip incubation is performed in four reservoirs for enhanced bead–cell
labeling. The mixture drains directly into a magnetic sorter, where the labeled cells are collected
by use of a magnetic field and unlabeled cells are directed into a waste outlet by the sheath buffer.
Such ultraspecific microfluidic devices have a recovery rate of more than 90%, purity of 83% in
14 clinical samples, and throughput of up to 10 mL/h using parallel devices. Studies have shown
that the integrated approach offers the best of both techniques, as these approaches yield high
recovery along with high specificity.
3. CIRCULATING TUMOR CELLS AS A THERAPEUTIC TARGET
Cancer therapies that target CTCs are compelling, considering that more than 90% of deaths
due to cancer are related to metastasis (63). Metastasis begins when a small population of tumor
cells, namely CTCs, break away from the primary tumor site and intravasate into the peripheral
circulation (64, 65). Once in the circulation, CTCs travel to distant sites where they tether,
roll, and eventually extravasate into the underlying tissue in a selectin-dependent manner (66).
Ultimately, metastasizing cancer cells can form secondary tumors. Although conventional surgery
and radiation may be effective at excising primary tumors, secondary tumors are much smaller
and more difficult to detect until they prove fatal. Therefore, the development of technologies
that directly target CTCs before they have the chance to form secondary tumors could potentially
reduce metastasis-related deaths.
Many cancer types metastasize into the lymph nodes, as well as the circulatory system (67). At
first glance, tumor cells engrafting in the lymph nodes seems counterintuitive, since the lymph
nodes are epicenters of immune cell congregation and immunosurveillance. However, tumor
cells can release tumor-associated factors that convert the immunogenic microenvironment of the
lymph nodes into an immunosuppressive state that can tolerate and even promote the localization
of metastasizing cancer cells (68). The presence of cancer cells in the lymph nodes necessitates
therapeutics that can not only selectively target cancer cells in lymph nodes but also reverse the
immunosuppressive state of the lymph nodes.
3.1. Therapeutics Directed at Circulating Tumor Cells
Because tumor metastasis is responsible for more than 90% of cancer-related deaths and most
distant metastases are formed by tumor cells leaving the primary tumor microenvironment and
intravasating into the circulatory system, anti-CTC therapeutics have the potential to neutralize
cancer metastasis and reduce cancer-related deaths (69). A straightforward approach to reducing
metastasis and cancer-related deaths is to remove CTCs from the circulation of metastasizing
patients. However, two main challenges faced by all CTC-capturing techniques are the rarity
of these cells and the lack of a unique identifiable marker. The number of CTCs is relatively
low in circulation—around 1–100 CTCs per milliliter of blood or approximately 1–100 CTCs per

106–107 leukocytes (70, 71). Existing CTC isolation techniques, including gradient centrifugation,
microfiltration, and EpCAM antibody targeting, are hampered by the limited volume of blood that
can be processed per trial (10–50 mL) and by a high background level of contaminating leukocytes
that routinely reduces the purity of the CTCs to below 1% (15, 72–74). Therefore, any CTC
selection technique must be able to process large volumes of blood while attaining high purity.
A recently proposed CTC removal process consisting of a sequential combination of two
semiautomated technologies—leukapheresis followed by counterflow centrifugation elutriation—
aims to address the above-described limitations (75, 76). Leukapheresis is a well-established density
filtration technology that is used clinically to harvest peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
from whole blood. Importantly, it can process the entire blood volume of a patient multiple times
over in a single session. Because CTCs and PBMCs have comparable density and size, leukapheresis
has been used to isolate CTCs from metastatic patients, yielding comparable results to other CTC
enrichment techniques (71, 77).
Following leukapheresis, the CTC isolation purity can be further improved with elutriation.
Elutriation is a process that is used to separate the subpopulations, primarily monocytes, of isolated
PBMCs by their size, and has been used to purify monocytes from dendritic cells (DCs) for
immunotherapy applications (78, 79). The size of CTCs can be similar to that of monocytes.
Thus, the enriched population of monocytes after elutriation is expected to contain CTCs as well.
The combination of leukapheresis and elutriation of 10 L of blood spiked with CaOV-3 tumor cells
yielded enrichment of up to 78% CTCs (75). CTCs with established surface markers (EpCAM,
cytokeratins, and CD45−) can further be enriched using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (80, 81).
An in vivo photoacoustic flow cytometry system was recently developed to detect and ablate
CTCs in tumor-bearing mice in a label-free manner (82–84). The advantage of this technology is
that it can process large volumes of blood; specifically, 5 L of blood can be processed in under 2 h.
Also, the technique has a high threshold sensitivity, as it is able to detect a single CTC from 107
normal blood cells (85–87). However, this technique has been tested only in a melanoma-bearing
mouse model (82).
3.2. TRAIL-Based Circulating Tumor Cell Therapeutics
After CTCs have entered the circulatory system, they travel to distant organs, extravasate out of
blood vessels and into the underlying tissue, and form secondary tumors. Similar to circulating
leukocytes, CTCs use interactions between selectins and ligands to tether, roll, and arrest onto
the vascular wall before subsequent extravasation into the distal site (66, 88–90). This knowledge
of the molecular mechanisms involved in CTC extravasation has led to the development of a
selectin-based implantable shunt device that can capture and eradicate CTCs (91). The device is
a microtube with its luminal surface functionalized with E-selectin molecules and tumor necrosis
factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) to facilitate CTC rolling and eventual tumor
cell apoptosis, respectively.
TRAIL has generated extensive research attention as a cancer therapeutic because it can
selectively induce apoptosis in a variety of tumor cell lines while sparing most normal cells.
TRAIL induces cell death in target cells through binding to death receptors DR4 and DR5,
giving rise to the extrinsic caspase-dependent apoptosis signaling pathway (92). Although the
clinical success of TRAIL therapy for solid tumors has been somewhat limited because some
cancer cell types exhibit varying degrees of TRAIL resistance, TRAIL-resistant cancer cells
become more sensitive to TRAIL after they have detached from the extracellular matrix (93).
Moreover, tumor cells become more “sensitized” to TRAIL when exposed to fluid shear stress
(94). In the circulatory system, where wall shear stress can range from 0.5 to 4.0 dyn/cm2 in
338 Lin et al.

BE20CH14_Nagrath-King ARI 29 April 2018 11:32
the venous circulation and up to 30.0 dyn/cm2 in the arterial circulation, CTCs experience a
significantly higher shear environment than cells in the primary tumor site (95). Furthermore,
CTC sensitivity to caspase-dependent apoptosis is positively correlated with fluid shear stress
level and exposure time (94, 96, 97). Thus, the natural detachment of metastatic CTCs from
the primary tumor microenvironment and into the higher shear environment of the circulatory
system makes them especially vulnerable to TRAIL-based therapy.
More recently, liposomes functionalized with TRAIL and E-selectin molecules readily attach
onto circulating leukocytes under flow, thus turning these leukocytes into “unnatural killer cells”
within the circulatory system that can induce apoptosis in any CTCs they come into contact with
(98, 99). More importantly, mice bearing colorectal CTCs experienced a reduction of tumor cells
lodged in the lungs as well as a significantly higher rate of apoptosis (Figure 3). Density of COLO 205 cells in lung (cells/mm3 × 103)

Aside from leukocytes, platelets also routinely interact with CTCs in the bloodstream, making
them attractive candidates for therapeutic vehicles. Platelets facilitate the progression of metas￾tasis through CTC–platelet aggregation (100–102). They do so in multiple ways: They protect
CTCs by shielding antigen-derived epitopes on tumor cells that are normally recognized by
circulating immune cells and increase CTC extravasation potential by inducing an epithelial￾to-mesenchymal-like transition (103–106). Multiple studies have introduced platelet-targeting
liposomes that contain platelet aggregation inhibitors to prevent CTC–platelet aggregation (107–
109). As an alternative to existing antiaggregation therapies, several studies have proposed antitu￾moral therapeutics that exploit the natural tendency of CTC–platelet aggregation. For example,
Li et al. (110, 111) engineered platelets to express TRAIL on their plasma membrane (Figure 4).
With this technique, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells were transduced with lentiviral vec￾tors containing the TRAIL gene and a megakaryocyte-specific promoter (Figure 5). Sixty days
after bone marrow transplantation, bioluminescence images revealed a significant reduction in
metastasis in mice with TRAIL-expressing platelets (Figure 6). From the standpoint of CTC
therapeutics, platelets are increasingly being explored as potential antitumoral vehicles due to
their interactions with CTCs (112).
3.3. Circulating Tumor Cell Therapeutics in Tumor-Draining Lymph Nodes
In patients with melanomas, carcinomas, and sarcomas, the first route of metastasis is via the tumor￾draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) (113–116). With melanomas in particular, 80% of metastasizing
tumor cells travel to the lymph nodes, while the remaining 20% enter the circulation or directly
seed (117). Among patients with lung, breast, and colorectal cancers, around 29–37% are diagnosed
with metastases in their lymph nodes (67). Therefore, metastatic lymph node prognosis is an
important indicator of metastatic burden pre- and posttreatment in many types of cancer therapy
(118–121).
The lymphatic system is a network of vessels that exist throughout the interstitial space of
tissues and organs in the body. The body uses these lymphatic vessels to remove waste, toxins,
and other unwanted materials from the organs. More importantly, the vessels transport lymph,

of the lymphatic vessels drain into lymph nodes, where innate immune response transitions into
adaptive immunity: Antigen presenting cells such as DCs and macrophages travel there to prime
na¨ıve T and B cells with the processed antigens (122). For the most up-to-date understanding of
how immune cells home to the lymph nodes, see Reference 122.
Tumor cells have several means of escaping the immune response, including the production
and release of immunosuppressive factors, impairment of immune cell priming, and recruitment

of suppressive immune cells instead of cytotoxic immune cells (123–125). When these cancer￾derived immunosuppressive factors drain into the lymph nodes, they can change the lymphatic
system from an immune-responsive environment into an immune-repressive one that tolerates
tumor metastasis.
Natural killer (NK) cells are innate response immune cells that reside mostly in the paracortex
of the lymph nodes. NK cells exert a natural cytotoxic effect against TRAIL-sensitive tumor
cells through their constitutive expression of TRAIL on the cell surface and on their cytoplasmic
granules, which are released during an immune response (126–128). However, tumor cells possess
many mechanisms to evade NK cell–mediated tumor cytotoxicity, including downregulation of
their expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, shedding of ligands for
activation receptors, and secretion of inhibitory cytokines that can reduce TRAIL expression on
NK cells (68, 129–132). To overcome these limitations, researchers have explored enhancing NK
cell proliferation and cytokine production with in vivo stimulation using cytokines or ex vivo
activation/expansion methods (133–135). However, these studies were met with limited success
due to an increase in systemic toxicity, suppression by MHC molecules, and rejection from the
host (136). To enhance the intrinsic tumor-suppressing capability of NK cells in the TDLN,

Chandrasekaran et al. (137, 138) developed TRAIL-decorated liposomes that specifically bind to
NK cells in the tumor-draining inguinal lymph node and effectively prevent the metastatic spread
of the primary tumor. Liposomes were functionalized with TRAIL and anti-NK1.1 antibodies via
thiolation; the liposomes then selectively bound to NK cells (Figure 7). After 6 weeks, NK cells in
the tumor-draining inguinal lymph nodes were able to significantly suppress the metastatic burden
(Figure 8). These results substantiate the antitumoral therapeutic potential of NK cells in the
draining lymph nodes and elsewhere. Although NK cells naturally exhibit antitumoral capability,
they are susceptible to becoming anergic against tumor cells. Current and future NK cell–based
immunotherapy must overcome NK cell paralysis while expanding these cells’ existing antitumoral
potential.

3.4. Antitumor Vaccines
As antigen presenting cells, DCs sample the tissue and tumor microenvironments and phagocytose
tumor-derived antigens (139, 140). DCs have the special ability to process the phagocytosed
antigens, present them to na¨ıve T cells residing in the lymph nodes, and trigger the proliferation
of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) against the tumor cells in the lymph nodes (141).
Several strategies have been proposed that utilize DCs as vehicles to deliver tumor antigens to
the lymph nodes with the aim of activating or expanding the patient’s immune response against
tumor cells. One such strategy is to coadminister tumor lysates in conjunction with the potent DC
adjuvants CpG oligodeoxynucleotides so as to elicit an immune response (142, 143). However,

the tumor-induced immunosuppressive microenvironment of the TDLNs prevents a sustained
and robust CTL response, even in the presence of highly immunogenic antigens (144, 145).
Interestingly, the administration of an adjuvant alone, without tumor antigen, is enough to elicit
an immune response despite the immunosuppressive state of the TDLNs (146, 147). However,
novel therapeutic strategies that prevent and/or reverse the immunosuppressive state of TDLNs
may still be warranted to maximize the potential of antitumoral CTL responses.
Synthetic implantable scaffolds that mimic the natural lymph nodes chemically and struc￾turally and can accommodate an immunogenic microenvironment provide great spatiotemporal
control and are promising alternative locations for immune cells to cross-talk, proliferate and
disperse (123). Hydrogels made from monomethoxy-PEG-co-polylactic-co-glycolic acid copoly￾mer hydrogels release granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor to attract DCs into the
matrix (148). Viral vectors containing tumor antigens are then injected locally into the implanted
hydrogels to activate the recruited DCs. These cells then travel to the TDLNs to activate the
proliferation of CTLs. In a different model, proposed by the Mooney group (149, 150), instead
of using viral vectors to introduce tumor-derived antigens to DCs, the antigens and adjuvants are
immobilized into the hydrogel matrix. These authors observed sustained DC recruitment into the
scaffolds that resulted in a significant and sustained proliferation of antigen-specific CTLs. These
results convincingly demonstrate the superior antitumoral therapeutic potential of DC priming
using implantable synthetic scaffolds in comparison to treatments without scaffolds.
4. CONCLUSION
While surgical removal of cancerous tissue may be curative, by the time most patients are diag￾nosed, their disease might have progressed to a stage where surgery may not be an option. There￾fore, early detection can change the pace of cancer management. CTCs could be that potential
biomarker for detection, not only because of their specificity but also because they are amenable to
serial sampling during the course of disease. Establishing CTCs as a potential biomarker for early
diagnosis, monitoring, staging, prognosis, and therapeutics of cancer can drastically change the
current paradigm of cancer diagnosis and management. To establish CTCs as a robust biomarker
for early diagnosis of cancer, the technology has to meet the challenge of addressing both the phys￾ical and biological heterogeneity of circulating cells in blood. In this review, we have discussed
technologies for CTC isolation that are evolving rapidly to enable molecular characterization
beyond enumeration. We have highlighted emerging approaches focusing on high throughput,
purity, and recovery of heterogeneous population, which are key to developing a robust and re￾liable diagnostic test based on CTCs. Given the momentum this field has recently gained, it will
not be too long before we see a blood-based diagnostic test for cancer in a clinic near us.
In addition, in this review we have described recent and ongoing research aiming to neutralize
CTCs and stop metastatic spread through both the circulation and the tumor-draining lymphatic
system. Each therapeutic approach has its own strengths as well as limitations for different cancers.
The research summarized here illustrates the possibility that these therapeutics, alone and in con￾junction with existing clinically approved antitumoral therapies, may one day neutralize metastasis
of a broad range of tumor types systemically, as well as reduce the number of metastasis-related
deaths.
The challenges ahead include gaining a better understanding of the biological makeup of
CTCs to improve the rate of CTC removal from circulation. While TRAIL-based therapeutics
are promising for TRAIL-sensitive tumor cells, a similarly robust system is needed for cancer
cells that may not be sufficiently responsive to TRAIL. Immunotherapy involving the priming
of DCs, whether from bolus administration of adjuvants or through an implantable synthetic
