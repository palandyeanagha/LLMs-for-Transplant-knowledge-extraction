Abstract. An intestinal bacterial metabolite of ginseng 
protopanaxadiol saponin, 20-O-(β-D-glucopyranosyl)-20(S)-
protopanaxadiol (compound K), has been reported to induce 
apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells. However, the precise 
mechanisms induced by compound K in human hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) cells remain unclear. In order to examine 
possible apoptotic mechanisms, we investigated the anticancer 
effect of compound K in MHCC97-H. MTT assay showed 
that compound K inhibited the proliferation of MHCC97-H 
cells with a relatively low toxicity in normal hepatoma cells. 
Cell cycle progression and cell staining showed an increase 
in apoptotic sub-G1 fraction. Treatment of MHCC97-H with 
compound K also induced a reduction in mitochondrial 
membrane potential (Δψm) and DNA damage. Further study 
showed that compound K upregulated Fas, FasL, Bax/Bcl-2 
ratio and downregulated pro-caspase-9, pro-caspase-3 in a dose￾dependent manner, and it also inhibited Akt phosphorylation. 
These results suggest that compound K significantly inhibits 
cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in MHCC97-H cells 
through Fas- and mitochondria-mediated caspase-dependent 
pathways in human HCC cells.
Introduction
Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most 
common malignancy in the world (1), and has a marked 
increase in younger-aged groups (2). The occurrence of tumor 
is induced by the imbalance between cell proliferation and 
apoptosis. Apoptosis is a fundamental cellular event during 
development and is critical for the cytotoxicity induced by 
anticancer drugs (3); it can be initiated by extracellular and 
intracellular signals that trigger a complex mechanism of 
pro-apoptotic proteases and mitochondrial changes and is 
the integration of multiple survival and death signals that 
determine whether a cell is to survive or undergo apoptosis. 
Previously, it was reported that compound K could induce 
apoptosis in cancer cell lines (4,5). However, the detailed 
molecular mechanism and crosstalk between these apoptosis￾related signals remains largely unknown.
Ginseng radix, the root of Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer, is 
frequently used as a traditional medicine in Asian countries. 
It is used worldwide for preventive and therapeutic purposes 
(6). In recent years, ginsenosides, extracted from ginseng 
radix, have become a research hotspot for their wide range 
of biological and pharmacological activities (7). However, 
ginsenosides are considered a prodrug, and are rarely absorbed 
into the blood from the gastrointestinal tract (8). The really 
active components is 20-O-(β-D-glucopyranosyl)-20(S)-
protopanaxadiol (compound K or M1; Fig. 1).
Compound K is a novel ginseng saponin metabolite, 
formed from ginsenosides Rb1, Rb2 and Rc by the human 
intestinal bacteria deglycosylation (9,10). It has been identi￾fied and purified after giving ginseng extract in humans and 
rats, and detected as one of the major metabolites after oral 
administration (11,12). Thus, compound K was speculated to 
be the major form of protopanaxadiol saponin absorbed by the 
intestine. Moreover, compound K has previously been found 
to possess chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic potential, 
including cardiac protection (13), antimetastasis effect (14), 
attenuating hepatic lipid accumulation (15), antigenotoxic 
and anticlastogenic activity induced by benzopyrene (16), 
antitumor activity in cisplatin-resistant pulmonary adenocar￾cinoma cells (17) and reversing multidrug resistance in tumor 
cells (18).
In the present study, we specifically selected MHCC97-H 
cell line as the experiment model, as it is a highly metastatic 
HCC cell line, and this may provide more insight into some 
cases than normal HCC. The main focus of this study was to 
test the hypothesis that compound K inhibits the growth of 
Compound K-induced apoptosis of human 
hepatocellular carcinoma MHCC97-H cells in vitro

MHCC97-H cells through induction of apoptosis and possible 
apoptosis signal pathways.
Materials and methods
Materials. Compound K (purity >98%) was prepared and iden￾tified as previously described (19). HCC cell line MHCC97-H 
and normal human hepatocyte cell line chang-liver were 
purchased from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of 
Sciences (Shanghai, China). Propidium iodide (PI) was obtained 
from Bio Basic Canada Inc. (Toronto, Canada). Bisbenzimide 
(Hoechst 33258), acridine orange (AO), ethidium bromide (EB), 
methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) and monoclonal mouse 
anti-β-actin antibody were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich 
Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Mitochondrial membrane potential 
(Δψm) detection kit was purchased from Nanjing KeyGen 
Biotech, Co., Ltd. (Nanjing, China). Antibodies against pro￾caspase-9, pro-caspase-3, cleaved-caspase-8, Fas, FasL, p-Akt, 
Akt, Bax, Bcl-2, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti￾rabbit and goat anti-mouse antibodies were purchased from 
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).
Cell culture and treatment. MHCC97-H cell line was cultured 
in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco, Grand Island, 
NY, USA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; 
HyClone, Logan, UT, USA), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml 
streptomycin, at 37˚C in a water-saturated atmosphere of 5% 
CO2 in air. Compound K was prepared in dimethyl sulphoxide 
(DMSO) at a concentration of 50 mM as a stock solution. Prior 
to use, the stock solution was diluted to the required concen￾tration immediately. Control cells were treated with equivalent 
amount of DMSO without compound K.
Cell viability assay. Cell viability was examined by MTT 
assay. Briefly, cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density 
of 5x103
 cells/well in a 200 µl medium, and then treated with 
compound K or DMSO for a predetermined period. Then, 
200 µl of MTT (0.5 mg/ml) was added to each well and 
the plates were incubated for an additional 4 h at 37˚C. The 
medium was replaced with DMSO to dissolve the formazan 
produced from MTT by viable cells. The optical absorbance 
at 570 nm was proportional to the percentage of cell viability. 
Fifty percent inhibitory concentration value (IC50) was calcu￾lated using Log-Probit regression analysis in SPSS 13.0.
Morphological study with fluorescence microscope. 
Exponential growth phase MHCC97-H cells seeded in 6-well 
plates were treated with 50 µM compound K or 0.1% DMSO 
for 48 h, harvested with 0.25% trypsin and resuspended 
in DMEM medium. Cells (1x106
) were washed and resus￾pended in PBS, followed by observation of the morphological 
changes. In addition, some cells were incubated with 10 µg/ml 
Hoechst 33258 for 10 min in the dark. Furthermore, 25 µl of 
cell suspension was mixed with 1 µl of dye mixture containing 
100 µg/ml AO and EB in PBS. Thereafter, cell morphology 
was visualized immediately under a fluorescence microscope 
(Leica DM IRB).
Cell cycle analysis. Cells were treated with compound K for 
24 h and were harvested and suspended in 1:1 (v/v) mixture of 
PBS and 0.2 M Na2HPO4-0.1 M citric acid (pH 7.5). Then, cells 
were fixed with 100% ice-cooled ethanol at 4˚C for 4 h, centri￾fuged at 800 x g for 5 min and washed twice, resuspended with 
PBS (1x106 cells/ml). Subsequently, 1x106
 cells were stained 
with 10 µg/ml PI containing 100 µg/ml DNase-free RNase A 
in the dark for 1 h at 37˚C. Then 20,000 cells were measured 
using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, San 
Jose, CA, USA). Data were analyzed with ModFit LT 3.2 soft￾ware (Becton-Dickinson).
Mitochondrial membrane potential assay. Cells treated with 
50 µM compound K for 48 h and control cells were incubated 
with 5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethyl-benzimidazolocar￾bocyanine iodide (JC-1) (0.1 µg/ml) for 15 min. After washing 
with PBS, the cells were suspended with PBS and observed 
with fluorescence microscope as previously described (20). 
The green fluorescence from JC-1 monomer and the red fluo￾rescence from the aggregated form of JC-1 were visualized.
Single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE). The comet assay 
was performed as previously described (21,22). Briefly, 
cells were suspended in 1% (w/v) low-melting point agarose 
and pipetted on to slides which were precoated with a layer 
of 1% (w/v) normal melting-point agarose (warmed to 37˚C 
before use). The agarose was allowed to set at 4˚C for 10 min, 
and the slides were then immersed for 1 h at 4˚C in a lysis 
solution. Slides were placed in single rows in a 30 cm wide 
horizontal electrophoresis tank containing 0.3 M NaOH and 
1 mM EDTA, pH 13.0 (unwinding solution) and kept at 4˚C 
for 40 min. Electrophoresis was performed for 30 min in 
unwinding solution at 30 V (1 V/cm) and 300 mA. Finally, the 
slides were washed 5 min for 3 times in 0.4 M Tris (pH 7.5, 
4˚C) and stained with EB.
Western blot analysis. Cells were washed and suspended 
in lysis buffer on ice for 10 min. Lysates were cleared by 
centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 10 min at 4˚C. The total 
protein, as determined by Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad 
Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA), was mixed with 4X 
loading buffer and pre-heated. Equal amounts of cell extracts 
were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto a PVDF 
membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The membrane 
was blocked and incubated 1 h with appropriate primary 
antibody. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti￾rabbit or anti-mouse IgG was used as the secondary antibody.

SPSS 13.0.
Results
Compound K inhibits MHCC97-H cell proliferation. To 
evaluate the cytotoxicity of compound K by MTT assay, 
MHCC97-H cells were treated with increasing concentrations 
of compound K for 6, 12, 24 and 48 h. As shown in Fig. 2A, 
cell viability was significantly reduced from 25-100 µM. In 
the same concentration, cell inhibitory rate is proportioned 
to the exposure time. Thus, compound K exhibited a dose 
and time‑dependent decrease in MHCC97-H proliferation. 
In contrast, normal hepatocyte chang-liver showed relatively 
strong resistance to compound K, with 50% inhibitory 
concentration (IC50) of 71.3±3.7 µM, whereas the IC50 against 
MHCC97-H was 49.8±2.5 µM for 48 h.
Morphological changes of MHCC97-H cells after exposure 
to compound K. In order to verify compound K-induced 
inhibition, we examined the changes of cell morphology after 
compound K exposure. As shown in Fig. 3A, cells treated with 
50 µM compound K for 48 h showed the typical appearance of 
apoptotic cells, such as nuclear fragmentation, cell shrinkage 
and apoptotic bodies under the phase-contrast microscope. In 
addition, with Hoechst 33258 staining, the blue emission light 
in apoptotic cells was much brighter than in the control cells 
(Fig. 3B). By comparison, the control cells were less bright 
blue and more homogeneous. With AO/EB staining, different 
cells (alive, apoptotic or necrotic) were clearly differentiated 
by different colors (Fig. 3C). These results showed that the 
compound K-treated cells exhibited morphological changes 
indicating apoptosis, including chromatin condensation and 
nuclear fragmentation.
Effect of compound K on the proportion of apoptotic 
MHCC97-H cells. To determine the effect of compound K on 
the proportion of MHCC97-H cells, apoptosis and cell cycle 
distribution were evaluated by flow cytometer. As shown in 
Fig. 4, MHCC97-H cells were treated with compound K at 
the concentrations of 25 µM (Fig. 4B), 50 µM (Fig. 4C), and 
75 µM (Fig. 4D) for 24 h, and then analyzed for cell cycle 
progression by flow cytometer. Sub-G1 fraction was detected 
from 13.92±0.14 to 45.61±7.78% in MHCC97-H cells, while 
only 0.62±2.12% in the control group (P<0.05; Fig. 4A and E). 
As shown in Fig. 4E, compound K induced cell cycle arrest at 
the G0/G1 phase in MHCC97-H cells as well as a progressive

decline of S phase. These results revealed that compound K 
induced apoptotic cell death concurrent with cell cycle arrest 
in MHCC97-H cells.
Disruption of Δψm by compound K. To investigate the loss 
of Δψm during apoptosis induced by compound K, cells 
were stained with JC-1 and monitored with a fluorescence 
microscope. JC-1 forms monomer and emits green fluores￾cence when Δψm is depolarized (common in apoptosis), 
while JC-1 aggregates and emits red fluorescence at a highly 
polarized Δψm. As shown in Fig. 5, JC-1 was accumulated 
in intact cells where it displayed red fluorescence indicating 
a high potential. In contrast, JC-1 was poorly accumulated in 
compound K-treated cells, which displayed only green or weak 
red fluorescence, indicating low membrane potential. These 
results strongly support the hypothesis that, after exposure to 
compound K, an initial interaction with redox-active iron takes 
place in the mitochondrial membrane compartments, resulting 
in destabilization of their membranes and Δψm is disrupted.
Tail-DNA is induced by compound K in SCGE. SCGE 
was employed to investigate the DNA damage induced by 
compound K in MHCC97-H cells. As shown in Fig. 6A, the 
comets resulting from exposure to compound K differed from 
control. Relatively undamaged cells gave comets consisting 
of a compact head without tail, indicating double-stranded 
DNA, while the comets originating from cells exposed to 
compound K (lower panel) had a distinct head with a tail, 
indicating the induction of DNA damage by compound K.
As compared with appropriate control, the mean tail-DNA 
is presented in Fig. 6B. Compound K evoked more increase 
in tail-DNA at concentrations as compared with the control. 
The increase of tail-DNA is positively proportioned to the 
concentration of compound K. These results indicate that DNA 
induced by compound K is closely associated with apoptosis.

proteins. Apoptosis is characterized by a well-organized 
sequence of cellular events, resulting in the activation of the

Fas/FasL and caspases cascade. In the group of apoptosis￾related proteins, Fas/FasL, PI3K/Akt, caspase-8 and Bax/Bcl-2 
are very important molecules for their regulatory role during 
apoptosis. We examined these proteins in MHCC97-H with 
compound K for 48 h.
As shown in Fig. 7, compound K not only significantly 
upregulated the expression of Fas/FasL and cleaved-caspase-8, 
but also decreased downstream proteins pro-caspase-9, 
pro-caspase-3 in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, 
compound K gradually inhibited Akt phosphorylation and 
increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. These results indicated that 
compound K-induced apoptosis may occur through Fas- and 
mitochondria-mediated caspase-dependent pathways.
Discussion
Apoptosis is required for proper tissue homeostasis. Defects 
in apoptosis signaling pathways contribute to carcinogenesis. 
Previous studies demonstrated that compound K may be the 
active metabolite responsible for the anticarcinogenic effects 
of ginseng saponin. This prompted us to investigate the effects 
of compound K in more detail. Although previous studies have 
reported that compound K exhibits a broad range of impor￾Figure 5. Mitochondrial membrane potential is disrupted after compound K

tant pharmacological effects, including anticancer activities 
(23,24), the precise mechanisms induced by compound K 
remain unclear.
Our previous study revealed that compound K can induce 
apoptosis in HCC (25). In the present study, we sought to demon￾strate the mechanisms of apoptosis induced by compound K. 
We found that compound K could inhibit the cell proliferation 
of MHCC97-H in a dose- and time-dependent manner with 
a relatively low cytotoxicity to normal hepatocytes, and 
increased sub-G1 phase in MHCC97-H cells. In addition, both 
phase contrast microscopy and fluorescence staining showed 
the typical appearance of apoptosis in compound K-treated 
cells. The results of SCGE showed the DNA damage in 
compound K is positively correlated with the drug concentra￾tion. These results suggest that compound K induces apoptosis 
in MHCC97-H cells. Moreover, the western blot analysis and 
Δψm of mitochondrial membrane results revealed apoptosis 
induced by compound K is through the caspase-dependent 
extrinsic and intrinsic pathways (26).
In the extrinsic pathway, Fas and FasL are widely recog￾nized as key regulators of the apoptosis signal transduction 
pathway. Fas is a type Ⅰ transmembrane receptor protein and 
Fas ligand is a type Ⅱ transmembrane protein. The ligation of 
Fas and FasL results in receptor trimerization followed by the 
binding of the adaptor molecule, Fas-associated death domain 
(FADD) to the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor (27,28). 
Then, FADD activates caspase-8, which triggers the caspase 
cascade through tbid and cytochrome c (29). Finally, caspase-3 
and several other effector pro-caspases were considerably 
activated (30) and caused DNA damage. In the present study, 
we found that compound K can upregulate the expression level 
of Fas and FasL in a dose-dependent manner. These results 
indicated that Fas-mediated caspase-dependent pathway is 
involved in the compound K-induced apoptosis in MHCC97-H 
cells.
In the intrinsic pathway, mitochondria play a central role 
in the commitment of cells to chemical-induced apoptosis 
(31). Cytochrome c normally resides in the mitochondrial 
intermembrane space, where it serves as a transducer of elec￾trons in the respiratory chain. Compound K can disrupt the 
Δψm of mitochondrial membrane, leading to the release of 
cytochrome c into the cytosol (32). After release from mito￾chondria, cytochrome c binds to apoptosis protease activating 
factor 1 (Apaf-1), which activates caspase-9 and downstream 
caspase-3. Then, caspase-9 and caspase-3 act together to 
destroy the death signal and finally lead to a unilateral process 
to apoptosis (33,34) by DNA damage. In our experiments, we 
found that compound K induced the loss of Δψm, downregu￾lated pro-caspase-9 and pro-caspase-3, in a dose-dependent 
manner. These data indicated that the mitochondria-medi￾ated caspase-dependent signal pathway is involved in the 
compound K-induced apoptosis in MHCC97-H cells.
The Akt kinase regulates the balance between survival 
and apoptosis factors. It is activated by binding with phos￾pholipids. Activated Akt (p-Akt) promotes cell survival by 
inhibiting apoptosis through phospho-inactivation of several 
targets, including Bad and caspase-9 (35). In the present 
study, we found that phosphorylation of Akt at Ser 473 was 
suppressed by compound K (Fig. 8A). The inhibition of Akt is 
likely to be involved in compound K-mediated growth inhibi￾tion of MHCC97-H cells. In addition, compound K promoted 
pro-apoptotic protein Bax expression, and decreased anti￾apoptotic protein Bcl-2 expression in MHCC97-H cells, 
leading to a decrease of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. The ratio between 
pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins determines the susceptibility 
of cells to an apoptotic death signal (36). Thus, p-Akt, Bax and 
Bcl-2 were also involved in compound K-induced apoptosis in 
MHCC97-H cells.
Taken together, the present study demonstrated that 
compound K, a ginseng saponin metabolite, significantly inhib￾ited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in MHCC97-H via 
Fas- and mitochondria-mediated caspase-dependent pathways 
(Fig. 8). The relatively low toxicity in normal hepatocytes and 
high activity in HCC MHCC97-H cells suggest that compoundK 
might be a promising experimental cancer chemotherapeutic 
and chemopreventive agent for human HCC (37).
