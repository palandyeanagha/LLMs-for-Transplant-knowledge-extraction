INTRODUCTION
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a
chronic progressive inflammatory dis￾ease, characterized by synovial inflam￾mation and hyperplasia, leading to pro￾gressive cartilage and bone destruction
(1). Patients with RA have a shortened
life span and cardiovascular diseases
caused by accelerated atherosclerosis
(2) are the most common cause of mor￾tality in these patients (3–7).
Recent studies have shown a possible
role of RA as an independent risk factor
for atherosclerosis, since traditional car￾diovascular disease risk factors could be
insufficient to explain the high inci￾dence of cardiovascular events (8,9). In
particular, RA with extra-joint involve￾ment, associated with high inflamma￾tion, is associated with greater cardio￾vascular mortality, suggesting a direct
role of RA in the pathogenesis of cardio￾vascular damage (10).
Increased arterial stiffness (a function
of aging and characterized by a reduc￾tion in elastin and an increase in colla￾gen) can be measured as pulse wave ve￾locity (PWV) (12). PWV is a vascular
parameter of important clinical signifi￾cance since it has been demonstrated to
be an independent predictor of cardio￾vascular events both in high-risk pa￾tients and in the general population (12).
Increased arterial stiffness was demon￾strated in RA patients at the abdominal
aorta (13) and carotid site (14), and as el￾evated aortic PWV (15). The latter alter￾ation was related to C-reactive protein
(CRP) levels, and was reversible after
anti-TNF therapy (15,16); but it also was
associated with risk factors such as age,
blood pressure, and abdominal obesity
(17). Interestingly, aortic PWV was re￾lated to paraarticular trabecular bone
loss at the ultradistal radius (18).
Physiologically, osteopontin (OPN) is a
potent inhibitor of mineralization; it pre￾vents ectopic calcium deposits, and is a
potent inducible inhibitor of vascular cal￾cification (19). On the other hand, this cy￾tokine is expressed in chronic inflamma￾Osteopontin Is Associated with Increased Arterial Stiffness in

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients are characterized by increased arterial stiffness, an independent predictor of cardiovascu￾lar risk. It has been suggested that osteopontin (OPN), a cytokine involved in RA pathogenesis, might have vascular effects. To
study a possible relationship between OPN and arterial stiffness, aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured by tonometry in
69 patients (41 with RA, 28 with systemic sclerosis [SSc]) and 18 healthy controls. Plasma OPN levels, oxidative stress markers, and
endothelin 1 (ET-1) were assessed. OPN levels were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in RA (median 9.93, range 4.36–47.80 ng/mL) than
in SSc (4.3, 2.1–19.7 ng/mL) or controls (5.2, 4.1–9.4 ng/mL). In RA patients, log-OPN was related to log–C-reactive protein (log-CRP)
(r = 0.30, P < 0.05), age (r = 0.38, P < 0.01), Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) (r = 0.58, P < 0.0001), and inversely related to
total cholesterol (r = –0.33, P < 0.05) and apolipoprotein A (apoA) (r = –0.58, P < 0.001), but not to oxidative stress markers and ET-1.
PWV was similar in RA (median 8.1, range 4.7–16.4 m/s) and SSc (median 8.7, range 7.1–13.1 m/s), but significantly greater (P <
0.01) than controls (median 7.5, range 4.1–10.4 m/s). Aortic PWV was related to log-OPN (r = 0.40, P < 0.01) only in RA patients. It
also was related to age (r = 0.34, P < 0.05), mean blood pressure (r = 0.44, P < 0.001), and HAQ (r = 0.48, P < 0.001). In multiple re￾gression analysis (r
2 = 0.36), including confounders, log-OPN remained a significant predictor (P < 0.05) of PWV in RA. Elevated
plasma OPN levels are associated with increased arterial stiffness in RA patients, suggesting that this protein might represent a
bridge protein between inflammation and the consequent joint damage and cardiovascular risk in RA patients.

tory and autoimmune diseases (20–25)
with proinflammatory functions, and it
has been suggested as a potential media￾tor of the promotion of joint destruction
in RA (26). Enhanced levels of OPN
mRNA and protein were found in syn￾ovial tissue from RA patients (27). More￾over, OPN deficiency has been shown to
protect joints against destruction in
arthritis-induced mice—suppressing
 articular destruction, chondrocyte apo￾ptosis, and synovial angiogenesis (28),
suggesting a direct role in bone readsorp￾tion beyond its effects on inflammation
(29). It also has been hypothesized that
OPN has a role in atherosclerosis, since
elevated levels of OPN are associated
with both the extent of cardiovascular
disease, independently of traditional risk
factors (30), and with restenosis (31).
Based on reported literature, the aim
of the present study was to investigate
the possible relationship between plasma
OPN levels with an established vascular
parameter of risk such as aortic PWV in
RA patients. The interaction with disease
activity and severity, inflammatory and
oxidative stress markers, and common
atherosclerotic risk factors also were
evaluated.
Plasma OPN levels and aortic PWV
will be evaluated both in a control group
and in a group of patients affected by
systemic sclerosis (SSc). The SSc group
serves as a non-case group characterized
by inflammation, ectopic calcification,
and vasculites, but without the articular
involvement typical of RA patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and OPN Measurements
Forty-one RA patients (30 Female [F],
11 Male [M]; mean age ± standard devia￾tion [SD]: 58.8 ± 10.3 years) were re￾cruited who fulfilled the American Col￾lege of Rheumatology (ACR, formerly,
the American Rheumatism Association)
1987 revised criteria for RA (32). Dura￾tion of disease was 11 ± 9 years (mean ±
SD). A non-case group (25 F, 3 M; 60.4 ±
9.4 years) consisting of 28 SSc patients,
and 18 healthy volunteers (controls)
(13 F, 5 M; 54.9 ± 7.8 years) also were
 recruited.
Patients were recruited at the Division
of Rheumatology (University of Pisa),
healthy controls were either friends or
neighbors of patients.
Exclusion criteria for patients and
controls were: past coronary angina,
previous myocardium infarction, cere￾bral ischemic stroke, or hypertensive
subjects with values of the arterial pres￾sure ≥ 140/90 mmHg or currently in an￾tihypertensive drug treatment. Patients
with statin and nonsteroidal antiinflam￾matory treatment also were excluded.
Patients (RA and SSc) and controls
were examined to evaluate the common
cardiovascular (CV) risk factors for coro￾nary artery disease such as positive fam￾ily history, smoking, diabetes mellitus, or
dislipidemia.
RA patient assessment included a stan￾dard assessment of disease activity and
severity, including the following parame￾ters: tender and swollen joint count (TJC
and SJC, respectively), 44 joint count for
swelling (SW44), general health status
(GH), Disease Activity Score (DAS28),
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR),
CRP for the evaluation of disease activ￾ity, modified Health Assessment Ques￾tionnaire (HAQ) score (32), joint deformi￾ties, extraarticular features, and erosions.
The protocol was approved by the Eth￾ical Committee of the University of Pisa,
and written informed consent was ob￾tained from each participant.
Experimental Procedures
Determination of OPN. For plasma
OPN measurement, blood samples (3 mL)
of RA and SSc patients, and healthy con￾trols were collected in EDTA-containing
tubes early in the morning. Samples
were centrifuged (400g, 15 min, at 4° C) to
remove cells and debris, and stored at
–80° C until used. Human Osteopontin
TiterZyme Enzyme Immunometric Assay
(EIA) kit (Gentaur Europe, Brussels, Bel￾gium) was used to perform the quantita￾tive determination of plasmatic OPN.
The kit utilized a monoclonal antibody to
human OPN.
Evaluation of inflammation markers,
stress oxidative factors, and common
atherosclerotic risk. All these parameters
were evaluated in RA and SSc patients,
and controls.
The unspecific markers of inflamma￾tion ESR and CRP were analyzed.
Rheumatoid factor (RF) was determined
by nephelometry.
Atherosclerotic risk was evaluated by
means of the quantitative analysis of total
cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoproteins
apoA1 and apoB, and homocysteine.
Oxidative stress factors also were ana￾lyzed: lipid peroxides, malondialdehyde
(MDA), the ferric reducing ability of
plasma (FRAP), and endothelin 1 (ET-1).
A sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA)
for human endothelin (1–21) was used
(Biomedica Gruppe, Wien, Austria).
Lipid peroxides were analyzed by thio￾barbituric acid reaction (33). FRAP was
evaluated according to Benzie et al. (34).
MDA was evaluated by means of the
colorimetric assay for lipid peroxidation
(OxisResearch, Biotech LP586, OXIS
Health Products Inc., Portland, OR,
USA).
Vascular function. Blood pressure (BP)
was measured three times at 3 min inter￾vals by an automatic device (OMRON￾950 CP, OMRON Healthcare Europe,
Hoofddorp, The Netherlands) at the
dominant arm and calculated as the
mean value of the last two measure￾ments. All measurements were per￾formed after an overnight fast, with the
subjects in supine position in a quiet, air￾conditioned room (22°–24° C).
Arterial tonometry was performed by
one trained operator (35) according to
the international recommendations (12).
A hand held probe was placed on the
artery and 10–15 subsequent images
were recorded. Aortic PWV was as￾sessed (SphygmoCor, AtCor Medical,
Sydney, Australia) by recording wave￾forms at the femoral and carotid site se￾quentially as distance-to-time ratio. Sur￾face distance between the two recording
sites was measured and a simultane￾ously recorded ECG was used as a refer￾ence frame to calculate wave transit

time. Coefficient of variation for PWV
was 13% (35).
Statistical Analysis
Because of skewed distribution of
OPN and aortic PWV, these variables
were logarithmically transformed and
expressed as median and range.
Data were analyzed using the non￾parametric Mann–Whitney U test, and
multiple regression. Spearman’s correla￾tion test was used for correlation analy￾sis. A P value < 0.05 was taken as the
level of statistical significance. All statis￾tical analyses were performed using
SPSS statistical software, Version 9.
RESULTS
Clinical characteristics of RA and SSc
patients and controls are shown in
Table 1. The three groups were compa￾rable for age, gender distribution, blood
pressure, and metabolic profile. CRP
levels were greater in RA patients and
similar in SSc patients and controls.
Disease activity variables of RA patients
are shown in Table 2.
OPN levels were significantly higher
(P < 0.05) in RA patients (median: 9.93,
range 4.36–47.80 ng/mL) as compared
with the other two groups, in which
OPN levels were not different (SSc pa￾tients: 4.3, range: 2.1–19.7 ng/mL,
healthy controls: 5.2; 4.1–9.4 ng/mL)
(Figure 1).
Patients with RA exhibited signifi￾cantly increased (P < 0.01) aortic PWV
(median 8.1, range 4.7–16.4 m/s) as
compared with controls (median 7.5,
range 4.1–10.4 m/s) (see Figure 1). Aor￾tic PWV also was significantly greater
(P < 0.01) in SSc patients (median 8.7,
range 7.1–13.1 m/s) than controls, but
not different from RA patients (see
 Figure 1).
In RA patients, logistic regression
showed that OPN levels above the me￾dian value were associated with a signifi￾cantly increased risk for having aortic
PWV above the median value of 7.6 m/s
(odds ratio of 4.3, 95% confidence inter￾vals: 1.09–17.2). Moreover, only in RA pa￾tients, log-OPN was related to log-aortic
PWV (r = 0.40, P < 0.01) (Figure 2). In
this group, log-OPN was related to log￾CRP (r = 0.30, P < 0.05), age (r = 0.38, P <
0.01), and inversely related to total cho￾lesterol (r = –0.33, P < 0.05) and apoA
(r = –0.58, P < 0.001), but not to mean BP.
On the other hand, log- aortic PWV also
was related to age (r = 0.38, P < 0.01),
and mean BP (r = 0.53, P < 0.0001), but
not to cholesterol levels or log-CRP.
No correlations were found between
log-OPN and oxidative stress markers,
the other common atherosclerotic risk
(except cholesterol), and ET-1.
Multiple regression analysis (r2 = 0.49),
including possible confounders such as
age, mean BP, cholesterol levels, and log￾CRP, showed that log-OPN remained a
significant predictor (P < 0.05) of log￾aortic PWV.
Log-OPN was related to HAQ (r =
0.58, P < 0.0001) but not SW44 and
DAS28. Aortic PWV was related to HAQ
(r = 0.44, P < 0.01), while no correlations
were found with SW44 and DAS28.
DISCUSSION
OPN is rapidly emerging as a major
player in both physiological and patho￾logical processes throughout the body, as
is evident from data that has emerged
from studies conducted over the past

few years. Literature showed that OPN is
involved in the evolution and progres￾sion of multiple systemic diseases (36); it
has been linked to the aethiopathogene￾sis of breast cancer (37), osteoporosis,
multiple sclerosis (21,38), inflammatory
bowel diseases (22), psoriasis (20,25), and
lupus erythematosus systemicus (24,39).
There is evidence that OPN also may be
implicated in RA pathogenesis (23,40).
Our aim was to study a possible rela￾tionship between OPN and arterial stiff￾ness, measured by aortic PWV, in RA pa￾tients. PWV is considered the gold
standard for assessing arterial stiffness,
and is an independent predictor of CV
events in high-risk patients and in the
general population (12).
Results showed that RA patients ex￾hibited higher plasmatic OPN levels (ap￾proximately two times) compared with
the healthy subjects and to the non-case
SSc patients, suggesting a peculiar role
for this protein in RA pathogenesis. This
is supported by the associations found in
RA patients between log-OPN and the
clinical parameters HAQ, and log-OPN
versus log-PWV.
RA patients exhibited higher aortic
PWV compared with controls, according
to published literature (15), and similar
PWV to SSc patients, but the novelty is
the association between log-OPN and
log-PWV, which showed significant re￾sults (P < 0.01) only in RA patients.
Considering the known properties of
OPN as a regulator of inflammation and
bone destruction in RA (26,27,41), we
suggest that OPN might be a point of
contact between inflammation and the
consequent articular damage and athero￾sclerosis in RA. The observed lower OPN
levels of non-case and healthy donors led
us to speculate that this inflammatory
and plaque destabilizing protein is pecu￾liar in RA pathogenesis. This hypothesis
is supported by the fact that patients
with SSc, who are characterized by in￾flammation, ectopic calcification, and
vasculites, but who don’t have articular
involvement, have similar OPN levels as
compared with healthy subjects; more￾over we have found that OPN levels cor￾related with PWV only in RA patients,
even if PWV levels were similar in RA
and SSc.
In multiple regression analyses, includ￾ing the possible confounders such as age,
mean BP, cholesterol levels, and log-CRP,
log-OPN remained a significant predictor
of log-aortic PWV in RA patients.
Although the RA patients studied
were free of overt CV disease, 18 patients
(44%) had high levels of total cholesterol.
A negative correlation was observed be￾tween OPN levels and total cholesterol,
and OPN levels and apoA. Also Take￾moto et al. (41) observed, as we did, a
significant negative correlation between
the plasma OPN level and serum total
cholesterol concentration.
Literature suggests a role for OPN in
RA pathogenesis. Enhanced levels of
OPN mRNA and proteins were found in
synovial tissue from RA patients (26),
and OPN deficiency has been shown to
protect joints against destruction in
 arthritis-induced mice (28).
Recently, a candidate treatment to sup￾press OPN expression, based on a novel
murine anti-OPN, 23C3, has been devel￾oped, and shows great potential in the
treatment of RA. In fact, administration
of 23C3 to mice with collagen-induced
arthritis (CIA) not only strongly sup￾presses the development of CIA, but also
decreases the severity of the existing
arthritis (42).
Moreover, an OPN promoter polymor￾phism at –66G and –443C recently has
been identified to be associated with
carotid artery intima media thickness,
which reflects generalized atherosclero￾sis, and is predictive of future vascular
events (43,44).
In conclusion, our results suggest that
patients affected by RA, free from CV
risk factors and overt CV disease,
showed high levels of plasmatic OPN,
and that OPN levels correlated with a
clinical severity index, and with a
marker of atherosclerosis and CV disease
such as PWV.
Moreover, in SSc patients (who are
characterized by ectopic calcification and
inflammation, but do not have the bone
erosion seen in RA patients) the levels of
OPN are much lower than those in RA
patients. In addition, SSc patients do not
have OPN related to PWV.
We hypothesize an active role of circu￾lating OPN in RA pathogenesis. OPN
might also act as an unfavorable CV risk
factor in patients with RA by perpetuat￾ing the inflammatory state that promotes
CV disease along with classical risk fac￾tors in RA. Our results suggest this pro￾tein might represent a bridge protein be￾tween inflammation, the consequent
articular damage, atherosclerosis, and
CV risk in RA patients.
