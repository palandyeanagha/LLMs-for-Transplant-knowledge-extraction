The maternal immune system engages in a fine balancing act during pregnancy by
simultaneously maintaining immune tolerance to the fetus and immune responses to
protect against invading organisms. Pregnancy is an intricately orchestrated process
where effector immune cells with fetal specificity are selectively silenced. This requires
a sustained immune suppressive state not only by expansion of maternal Foxp3+
regulatory T cells (Tregs) but also by leaning the immune clock toward a Th2 dominant
arm. The fetus, known as a semi-allograft or temporary-self, leads to remission of
autoimmune hepatitis during pregnancy. However, this tolerogenic immune state reverts
back to a Th1 dominant arm, resulting in post-partum flare of AIH. Various hormones
play a significant role in endocrine-immune axis during pregnancy. The placenta
functions as a barrier between the maternal immune system and the fetus also plays
a pivotal role in creating a tolerogenic environment during pregnancy. We review the
evidence of immune tolerance during pregnancy and immune escape at post-partum
period, focusing on patients with autoimmune hepatitis.

AUTOIMMUNE HEPATITIS
Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is an immune mediated chronic liver disease with unknown etiology
(1). Its prevalence ranges from 16 to 18 cases per 100,000 people in Europe (2). AIH is characterized
by an aberrant innate and adaptive immune response targeting liver autoantigens toward liver
parenchyma cells (hepatocytes) and epithelial cells (biliary epithelium) which perpetuate to liver
inflammation. If left untreated, AIH leads to chronic hepatitis, resulting in progressive fibrosis and
eventually leading to liver cirrhosis and cancer.
An individual’s susceptibility to AIH can be influenced by many factors including genetics and
environmental surroundings. Clinical manifestations of AIH vary from asymptomatic to fulminant
presentation (1–3). Genetic predisposition is thought to be governed by the HLA haplotype; this
determines the formation of the antigen binding site of MHC class II which in turn presents
autoantigens to CD4 T-cells (4, 5). Environmental triggers, such as Aryl hydrocarbon ligands, can

shape the T-cell immune response to direct it at liver antigens,
leading to inflammation and scarring downstream (6–8).
Autoimmune hepatitis predominantly affects females; a
significant proportion of which are young women of child￾bearing age (9, 10). Previously, pregnancy in AIH patients was
rare as it was viewed as high risk due to concerns of reduced
fertility and unknown safety profiles of immunosuppressive
regimens used in AIH (11). However, pregnancy in patients
with AIH is increasingly common due to recent advancements
in in vitro fertilization, advanced and protocolized clinical
management between the hepatologist and obstetrician, pre￾pregnancy counseling and an in-depth understanding of drug
safety profiles. Careful clinical monitoring of both mother and
child before conception (pre-pregnancy counseling) as well
as during pregnancy, with combined care from both liver
and obstetric teams is crucial to achieve a good outcome,
especially in cirrhotic patients. Post-partum follow up within
8 weeks is also prudent to detect and manage the flare up of
AIH after delivery.
Pregnant AIH patients experience disease remission during
pregnancy but often endure flare activity of AIH in the
early post-partum period (9, 12, 13). However, the underlying
immunological mechanism is still unresolved. In this review,
we discuss published evidence in order to understand immune
tolerance in pregnancy and immune escape in post-partum
period in AIH patients.
HORMONE AND LIVER ENZYME
CHANGES DURING PREGNANCY
The immune system functions to protect the body from harmful
foreign antigens. The innate and adaptive immune system work
in harmony to carry out these protective processes.
Cells involved in the innate immune response include
dendritic cells (DC’s), natural killer (NK) cells, neutrophils and
macrophages. DC’s function as antigen-presenting cells (APC’s)
and NK cells secrete cytokines and function as killer cells. The
innate cells then crosstalk with T cells, cytotoxic CD8 T cells,
helper CD4 T cells and antibody secreting B cells. Regulatory
T-cells function to prevent attack of self-antigens.
There are different phases during pregnancy, each of which
can be characterized by notable immunological shifts along with
changes in hormonal levels (14). Progesterone (P4) is critical in
the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. Rising levels
stimulate uterine homing of NK cells and up-regulation of HLA￾G gene expression, which are the ligands for NK inhibitory
receptors (15). It leads to the secretion of Th2 cytokines and
inhibition of Th1 development which suppresses the maternal
immune response to the fetus (16). In addition, P4 promotes fetal
growth by CD8+ T cell modulation by placental heme oxygenase
1 (Hmox1) expression (17). Estrogen rises at a similar rate. The
implantation of the blastocyst into the endometrial tissue creates
a cycle of cell repair, death and regeneration thus creating an
inflammatory environment to remove cellular debris (18, 19).
Human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) peaks between weeks 8
and 10 and then plateau’s as pregnancy progresses (20, 21).
Sickness ameliorates during the second trimester as the
inflamed environment disseminates. This period accounts for the
growth and development of the fetus. Toward the end of the
third trimester when the fetus has fully developed, parturition
is stimulated by the induction of a pro-inflammatory state (22).
Prolactin levels increase in late pregnancy to stimulate breast
milk production. The increase in islet mass is an adaptive
mechanism that occurs to combat insulin resistance during
pregnancy and prolactin has the ability to enhance beta-cell
proliferation and insulin secretion. The prolactin receptor is
required for normal glucose homeostasis and modulation of beta￾cell mass during pregnancy (23). Maternal leukocytes gather in
reproductive tissues and release pro-inflammatory cytokines to
stimulate uterine contractions and subsequent birth of the fetus
(22). Estrogen, P4, prolactin and hCG levels do not differ between
healthy and AIH pregnancies. IgG, an immunological marker
of AIH, increases more rapidly post-partum in AIH women
as it contributes to the disease flare. ALT and AST levels do
not change in healthy women but rise post-partum in a cohort
of AIH women who develop a flare. ALP gradually increases
throughout pregnancy in AIH women as it is produced by the
placenta (Figure 1).
REMISSION OF AIH DURING
PREGNANCY AND IMMUNE CELLS
DYNAMICS
Pregnant women are considered to be a unique population
as pregnancy creates a distinctive immunological state. The
change in immune cell frequency and cytokine profile during
pregnancy is related to the change in hormonal environment.
In other autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and
rheumatoid arthritis, disease severity decreases during gestation
but increases after birth. Schramn et al. reported that 73%
of 22 AIH patients experience a biochemical remission at
conception (24). This is thought to be due to pregnancy
hormones stimulating Th2 cells which halts the Th1 immune
response linked to autoimmune disease (25, 26). A bias of T cells
balance leaning toward Th2 phenotype is thought to be critical for
normal pregnancy (27). The specific interaction between the sex
hormones and Th2 cells requires deeper focus of exploration in
the laboratory to determine the exact mechanism of pregnancy￾linked autoimmune disease remission. This mechanism could
also explain disease remission in pregnant AIH patients.
Aghaeepoor et al. utilized mass cytometry to profile both
innate and adaptive immune cells in whole blood samples of
18 pregnant women collected at different trimesters throughout
pregnancy and 6 weeks post-partum. There was an enrichment
of circulating neutrophils, enhanced response of NK cells and
monocytes to viral challenges, and a dampened TLR4 response
to LPS in mDC in the innate compartment (28). It is also
noted in the study that there is an abundance of CD56+CD16−
NK cells during the first trimester. NK cells are important
for normal placental development and tolerance. The study
demonstrated progressive increase in endogenous STAT5ab
signaling across multiple T cell subsets including naïve, memory

CD4 and CD8 T cells, and Treg (28). Treg are crucial in
maintaining tolerance to the fetus during pregnancy. A study
using pregnant mice demonstrated that depletion of Treg via
the IL-2 receptor results in early resorption of allogeneic fetus
(29). IL-2-dependent STAT5 signaling is also crucial for the
development and function of CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs (30) which
operates via the CTLA-4 pathway (31). This finding suggests that
a progressive increase in endogenous STAT5 signaling activity
and circulating level of Tregs play a parallel role to maintain
feto-maternal tolerance during pregnancy (32). In addition, a
recent study on 33 longitudinally sampled bloods in pregnancy
demonstrated transient T cell polarization from Th1/Th17 to
Th2, not only in the CD4 subset but also in CXCR5+ T follicular
helper cells and CD8 T cells subsets (33) (Figure 2). This could
potentially explain why AIH patients often experience remission
during pregnancy. The suppressive capacity of CD4 + CD25bright
Treg cells was increased in the decidua of HLA-C mismatched
pregnant patients. Thus, HLA genotype of the mother and fetus
could also have an impact and this increase in Tregs could
explain AIH remission during pregnancy. The complex network
of immune cells at the decidual maternal interface and at the
human decidua suggested that the activated fraction of CD8 cells
are elevated but the naïve fraction are diminished. There is also a
diverse DC population (34).
Th2 type cytokines, including CCL22, produced by
trophoblasts, attract CCR4-expressing T cells in decidua
and play a central role in the induction and maintenance of
allograft tolerance during pregnancy (35). Thus Th2 cells are
present predominantly in the decidua in early pregnancy in
humans and its cytokines IL4 and IL6 induce the release of hCG
from trophoblasts which in turn stimulate production of P4
from the corpus luteum in pregnancy (36). Th1 cells (especially
Th1-dependent effector mechanisms) play a central role in acute
allograft rejection in pregnancy (37).
Hormones play a major role in pregnancy and contribute to
the endocrine-pregnancy-immune clock axis. During pregnancy,
there is a shift from Th1 toward Th2 predominance due
to a high level of circulating estrogen which explains the
improved AIH disease course during gestation (38) (Figure 2).
Experiments looking at the effects of pregnant mice treated
with estrogen concentrations during pregnancy show that
estrogen up-regulates the expression of CD4+CD25+Treg and
Foxp3mRNA, thus disrupting the balance between Th1 and
Th2 resulting in an enhancement of the tolerogenic immune
system (39). P4 dampens immune responses to fetal and maternal
antigens, and its regulatory role on Treg cells during human
pregnancy was initially reported in late 2000 (40). Both in vivo
and in vitro models suggest that P4 increases the proportion
of CD4+CD25+Treg cells whilst simultaneously enhancing
their suppressive capacity, suggesting that P4 may play a role
in promoting AIH disease remission during pregnancy (41).
Piccinni et al. demonstrated that P4 favors the development
of Th2 CD4+ T cells, suggesting that P4 contributes as
a factor for the Th2 predominance during pregnancy (42).
Additionally, P4 and glucocorticoids inhibit Th1 development
while enhancing Th2 polarity (16). P4 and testosterones have
known abilities to promote Th2 cells and have anti-inflammatory
properties (43). Thus, AIH remission during pregnancy may be
correlated to the differential variations in complex hormonal
profiles and the subsequent varying effect on immune tolerance
between individuals.
Pregnant AIH patients are in an immune tolerant state. In
addition, patients with AIH are already on immunosuppressive
medications including steroid, azathioprine and mycophenolate

FIGURE 2 | Immune cell balance in the peripheral blood differs between healthy patients, non-pregnant AIH patients, AIH patients during pregnancy and AIH

sometimes may lead to susceptibility to pathogens thus these
patients are prone to acquire viral infections including hepatitis E
infection (44). Pregnant AIH patients who are cirrhotic may also
be prone to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. During the current
COVID pandemic, the United Kingdom government and Public
Health England classified both AIH and pregnancy patients as
vulnerable groups and these patients were shielded1
.
TWIN PREGNANCY AND IMMUNE
RESPONSE
Autoimmune hepatitis is in remission both biochemically
and immunologically during pregnancy due to the Th1:Th2
balance shifts toward Th2 predominance. Th2 immunity is
more pronounced in twin pregnancies compared with singleton
pregnancies during the first trimester which is associated with
increased maternal hCG and P4 levels (45). The data on twin
pregnancies in patients with AIH are lacking therefore we can
only hypothesize based on the data published to date that a
highly expressed Th2 predominance in twin pregnancy will
lead to a greater remission of AIH disease. During the post￾partum period, the Th1:Th2 balance shifts back toward Th1
predominance. It can also be hypothesized that AIH patients
who have experienced a twin pregnancy may also experience a

greater shift from Th2 to Th1 predominance and thus resulting
in a greater post-partum flare compared to patients who undergo
a singleton pregnancy. It is likely that the mechanism of AIH
pregnancy and the post-partum period may differ between twin
and singleton pregnancies. Future research in this area should
focus on understanding the effects of twin pregnancies in AIH
patients, with particular interest in comparing remission during
pregnancy and post-partum to singleton pregnancies in AIH
patients. However, it is understandable that this research is
limited due to the rarity of an AIH patient pregnant with twins.
MULTIPLE PREGNANCIES AND AIH
The antigen-specificity and cellular origin of maternal Tregs
that accumulate during gestation remain undefined. Memory
T cells which recognize the antigen will play a significant role.
Pregnancy selectively stimulates the accumulation of maternal
Foxp3+ CD4 cells with fetal-specificity. Thus, after delivery,
fetal-specific Tregs persist at elevated levels to maintain tolerance
to pre-existing fetal antigen and rapidly re-accumulate during
a subsequent pregnancy. The accelerated expansion of Tregs
during secondary pregnancy is driven almost exclusively by
proliferation of fetal-specific Foxp3+ cells retained from a
prior pregnancy. Therefore, pregnancy can imprint a memory
phenotype in Treg and these Treg can sustain an anergic memory
response to fetal antigens in subsequent pregnancies (46). In
addition, pregnancy has both short and long-term effects on
the maternal memory T-cell population. Proportions of effector

Bozward et al. AIH: Pregnancy and Post-partum
memory T-cells (CD45RO−CCR7+) were significantly higher
in both pregnant and post-partum women compared to non￾pregnant women who had never been pregnant. Pregnant women
also had higher levels of activated memory T-cells, with the non￾pregnant women having the lowest proportions. This suggests
that the continuous exposure to fetal antigens during pregnancy
results in a much higher circulating population of memory
T-cells which persist after delivery (47). If the second pregnancy
follows the same pattern of AIH remission during pregnancy
followed by a post-partum flare, the reasoning may be that
circulating memory T cells mount the same response similar to
first pregnancy. It would be of interest to compare women who
have had multiple pregnancies and to follow them for longer than
6 months post-partum.
IMMUNE CELLS IN THE PLACENTA:
MATERNAL-FETAL INTERFACE
Pregnancy is characterized by the coexistence of two genetically
distinct persons. The placenta is an immunological barrier
between the mother and the semi-allograft; the fetus. Immune
cells interact at the feto-maternal interface composed of the
maternally derived decidua and the fetally derived placenta.
This is crucial for maintaining tolerance of the allogenic
fetus by the mother’s immune system during pregnancy.
After implantation of the blastocyst, trophoblast cells burrow
into the maternal decidua, which originate from the uterine
endometrium. Trophoblasts secrete hCG which is required
to induce progesterone from the corpus luterum. Several
mechanisms involving different immune cells and molecules are
involved in order to maintain placental function and survival
of the fetus (Figure 3). Most of the interactions are intended
to suppress the immune response and promote tolerance by
preventing the miscarriage or killing of allogeneic fetus.
The most abundant immune cells present in the decidua are
uterine NK (uNK) cells which are recruited by factors released
from the decidual stromal cells and placental trophoblasts. The
role of uNK cells is associated with decidual modeling and
promote trophoblast invasion. Their cytotoxicity is controlled
by the binding of HLA-G on the extravillous trophoblast
to the inhibitory receptor KIR2DL4. Decidual NK cells are
phenotypically different from peripheral NK cells counterpart by
producing growth factors, angiogenic factors, and cytokines (48).
In addition, primary antigen presenting cells at the maternal￾fetal interface in early pregnancy are decidual macrophages.
They have a regulatory M2 phenotype (49) and express IL-10
and also secret indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase which catabolizes
tryptophan, subsequently preventing T cell activation (50).
Regulatory T cells are crucial in pregnancy and there is
a strong inverse correlation of their frequency and function
with adverse pregnancy complications such as miscarriages and
spontaneous abortions (51–53). Treg are present in the decidua
and modulate the activities of both antigen presenting cells and
effector T cells. Fetal-specific Tregs maintain the maternal-fetal
interface tolerance and their expansion correlates with decreased
fetal resorption in mice models, showing Treg plays a role in
tolerance (46). Regarding effector T cells, HLA-C is expressed
by trophoblasts in the decidua and incompatibility between the
maternal and fetal HLA-C can also alter T-cell activation during
FIGURE 3 | The chronic villi in the placenta contains a blood supply rich with fetal antigens additional to HCG, estrogen, progesterone hormones, and immune cells
which are present in the placenta. Most predominant cells in decidual tissue is NK cells. Regulatory T cells are present to maintain tolerance at the maternal-fetal
interface. In addition, antigen presenting resident dendritic cells and macrophages are found within the chronic villi which present fetal antigens to naïve T cells (CD8
and CD4) located within the maternal artery transporting blood to the placenta. The maternal vein transporting blood from the placenta contains memory CD4 and
CD8 T cells as they have been exposed to the fetal antigens.

and the percentage of these cells is increased even more in the
presence of an HLA-C mismatch (54).
FLARE UP OF AUTOIMMUNE HEPATITIS
DURING PREGNANCY, POST-PARTUM
AND ITS UNDERLYING IMMUNE
MECHANISM
A flare is defined as a two-fold increase in serum transaminase
levels above the normal limit alongside elevated immunoglobulin
G (13). Around 20% of AIH patients experience a flare during
their pregnancy (24). Due to the return of normal immunity, AIH
flares are twice as frequent in the post-partum period than during
pregnancy (55). However, the underling immune mechanism
for a post-partum flare still remains elusive. AIH flares during
pregnancy are associated with a high rate of fetal and maternal
complications (55, 56).
The current understanding of this phenomenon evolves
around data concluding that flare up of AIH results from the
loss of the pregnancy-associated immunosuppressive state (29,
57). Changes in the maternal immune cell subsets such as T, B,
and NK lymphocytes occur during and after pregnancy. Helper
T cells and cytotoxic T cells are the first cell subsets to increase
1–4 months post-partum (58). At around 7–10 months post￾partum, there is an increase in frequency of the suppressor T
cell and B cell populations (58). The increase in T and B cells are
thought to be related to the post-partum onset or aggravation of
AIH (12, 58). Schramn et al. reported that the majority of AIH
flares occur at a median gestational age of 3 months after delivery
(24) thus supporting the theory that an increase in effector T
cells, specifically helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells, may be the
main cell subsets responsible for post-partum flares. An increase
in suppressor T cell and B cell populations could play a role in the
recovery from a post-partum flare.
Many immune-mediated diseases are ameliorated by the
process of pregnancy and are coupled with subsequent flares
following parturition. As previously stated, CD4+CD25+Treg
are a subset of CD4 T cells with immunosuppressive and
tolerogenic functions (59, 60). An early report by Aluvihare
et al. on Treg suggested that they regulate maternal immune
tolerance to the fetus; which is an allo-antigen to the mother’s
immune system (29). Thus, Treg cells are necessary to maintain
maternal-fetal immune tolerance to ensure that the pregnancy
is successful. A number of studies have since confirmed
that Treg frequency is increased in the maternal peripheral
blood and play a crucial role in the maternal-fetal immune
tolerance (36, 61). In addition, proportion of CD4+CD25+Treg
in pregnant women is significantly higher compared to non￾pregnant women but decreased significantly after birth compared
to non-pregnant women (62). Estrogen also mediates Treg cell
expansion via Estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) signaling and the
transcriptional regulation of Foxp3 which subsequently induces
Tregs suppressive function (39). This provides a potentially
strong explanation for remission of AIH patients during
pregnancy, often followed by a post-partum disease flare. The
shift of immune balance to Th1 predominance is noted after a
decline in blood concentration of estrogen following delivery,
and this could be an additional reason for a flare in AIH
(63) (Figure 2). Although the effect of high level estrogen
during pregnancy was thought to induce tolerance, more recent
investigations have shown that heightened levels of estrogen
receptor alpha (ERα) is leading to the impairment of Tregs
in AIH (64). A fall in P4 also leads to lack of inhibition of
Th1 development which could result in a post-partum flare in
AIH patients (16). The presence of fetal cells, which remain in
maternal circulation for years after birth, may play a role although
the specific mechanism and extent of their presence in relation to
AIH flares post-partum is still unclear (25).
There is a correlation between women with AIH who
experience a flare in the year before conception and those who
experience post-partum flares (10). If we were able to identify
the similarities in cell subsets between a flare before pregnancy
and a post-partum flare, we may be able to predict those patients
who are at high risk to post-partum flares before it occurs.
This will provide us with sufficient time to monitor and adjust
immunosuppression which will likely prevent the post-partum
flare and subsequent liver fibrosis. Women with AIH who are not
currently undergoing immunosuppressive therapy are also at a
higher risk for experiencing a flare post-partum (10).
CURRENT PROPOSED MECHANISMS
OF TOLERANCE AND IMMUNE ESCAPE
Currently, there is only limited research in the field of immune
tolerance in pregnant AIH patients. The immunome changes
should be longitudinally observed throughout pregnancy and
post-partum period. So far, the evidence suggests that rising
levels of estrogen increase the expression of CD4+ CD25+ Tregs
which shifts the immune balance to favor Th2 cells (25, 39).
This is further supported by an increase in circulating IL-2 in
pregnant women which increases Treg proliferation via STAT5
signaling (28). The suppressive capacity of Tregs has also been
shown to be increased in pregnant patients (54). These changes
are important for maintaining feto-maternal tolerance (61) but
are also most likely responsible for the amelioration of AIH
symptoms in pregnant patients. It is possible that naïve T-cells
differentiate into Th2 cells after stimulation by estrogen, P4 and
fetal antigens (Figure 4). These factors can also stimulate DCs
which in turn stimulate naïve T-cells. Fetal antigen receptors are
extracellular receptors whereas P4 and estrogen receptors are
intracellular. After delivery, the fall in estrogen and P4 and the
presence of prolactin may exert Th1 prominence via naïve T-cells
or DCs (Figure 4).

considered to be Th1− and Th17−dominant diseases, thus a

by the mother via adaptive immune cells involving both direct and indirect pathways. Direct pathways include pregnancy hormones and fetal antigens presenting to

balance. Indirect pathway involve hormones and fetal antigen priming to naïve cells via antigen presenting dendritic cells resulting in Th2 cells proliferation and Th1
cells apoptosis (in pregnancy) and reverse effect during post-partum period.
decline in Th1 and possibly Th17 during pregnancy is expected
to lead to the improvement of these diseases similar to AIH.
Improved outcomes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (65),
multiple sclerosis (66), and psoriasis (67) was observed and
a relapse after delivery has been reported possibly due to the
reconstitution of Th1/Th17 immunity post−partum. Normal
human pregnancy is associated with an elevation in the immune
suppressive CD25+ CD4+ regulatory T−cell subset, thus this
relapse could occur because of the reduced levels of Tregs (61).
On the other hand, autoimmune diseases such as asthma,
actopic dermatitis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and
pemphigus are Th2− and/or Th17−dominant autoimmune
diseases (68–71). These patients experience the exacerbation of
disease during pregnancy. Although Th17 is a known player
in these autoimmune diseases, these diseases flared up during
pregnancy. This may be due to the higher importance of
Th2 compared with Th17. It could also be explained with
the possible increased populations of Th17 cells in pregnancy,
which is still under investigation. Systemic lupus erythematosus
generally affect women of reproductive age. Autoimmune
hepatitis was initially known as lupoid hepatitis due to it’s
association of chronic active hepatitis in SLE patients. Some of
the AIH patients have a coexisting SLE condition. A previous
study suggested diminished CD4+ Tregs were observed in
pregnant lupus patients which might be another important
factor responsible for pregnancy associated complications.
Although AIH patients experience disease remission during
pregnancy, other autoimmune diseases may have a flare up
due to underlying immune cell balance changes. This aspect of
mutiorgan autoimmune disease flare up or remission will require
further research.
ESTROGEN AND ITS SIGNALING IN
PREGNANCY
Molecular and metabolic immunological changes that occur
during pregnancy are influenced by a variety of hormones which
leads to intracellular signaling and results in pregnancy induced
tolerance. Estrogen bind to two nuclear estrogen receptors (ERs)
(ERα and ERβ)which are expressed in T cells and activate
intracellular signaling pathways. Estrogen has a different impact
on T cells. Pregnancy-level concentrations of estrogen restrain
the conventional Foxp3neg CD4+ T cells to differentiate to
Th17 cells (72). ERα signaling in T cells is necessary for
E2-mediated inhibition of Th1/Th17 cell differentiation and
protection from neurological autoimmune diseases in mice
(72). This may explain the reason of improvement in MS in
pregnancy. ERα can contribute to T cell-mediated autoimmune
inflammation by promoting T cell activation and proliferation
(73) thus ERα-targeted immunotherapies could be used to treat
autoimmune disorders.
ROLE OF TH17 CELLS IN PREGNANCY
Autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis,
inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis and autoimmune
skin diseases are not only solely Th1 driven diseases; Th17 cells
have also been implicated in these disorders. There is evidence

Multiple sclerosis (MS), a T cell–mediated autoimmune
disease, is such an example. Reduced disease activity of MS
is commonly observed during pregnancy, suggesting that

estrogens could downmodulate the autoimmune response and
inflammation (74–76). Protective effects of estrogens have
been reported in clinical trials using estriol or 17β-estradiol
(E2) (77–80) in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients.
The growing knowledge suggests that AIH is multi-facetted
immune dysregulation, which involves Th1/Th17 polarization
and the suspected inability of regulatory T cells to revert
autoimmunity. Manipulation of the Th1 axis with standard-of￾care immunosuppressive medications and also blocking IL17 and
IL22 may be important in preventing post-partum flare up in AIH
patients in the future.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE
PERSPECTIVES
Women with autoimmune hepatitis who wish to become
pregnant must be closely monitored by an interprofessional team
including hepatologists due to the increased risk of adverse
outcomes. Pregnancy is becoming more common in AIH patients
as the majority of the cohort are young women. It is now accepted
that there is a decreased risk in AIH owing to close surveillance
and clinical, medical and technological improvements associated
with positive outcomes for both mother and child. To further
decrease the accompanying risks, it would be beneficial to
broaden our understanding of the immunology aspects involved
with remission, flares and recovery from flare up. This will
not only provide us with a reliable immunological biomarker,
giving clinicians guidance to predict, diagnose and treat adverse
effects including flare up of AIH, but it may also enable the
team to manipulate cell subsets with immune based therapy to
avoid adverse outcomes alongside the continued support of an
interprofessional team.
Current diagnostic markers for AIH include biochemistry,
liver histology and immunology (IgG and autoantibodies)
as suggested by International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group
(IAIHG). However, it is still difficult to predict which patient
group will experience a flare up during pregnancy and post￾partum. Thus, new predictive markers in both peripheral blood
compartment and tissue compartment (liver) are crucial. Recent
advances in OMICs (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics,
and metabolomics) and deep immunophenotyping technology
could be utilized to predict the outcome and prognosis of
the clinical pathway of these patients. Mass cytometry allows
the identification of a wide variety of both intracellular and
extracellular markers hence making it the ideal method to
determine the differences in immune cell expression in these
samples. Currently it is not possible to predict a flare of
AIH on those who are already on immunosuppression. In the
future, this technology may pave the way to predict the flare
precisely and tailor the adjustment of immunosuppression. In
addition, immunological analysis of blood samples from healthy
pregnant, healthy non-pregnant and AIH non-pregnant samples
at different stages throughout pregnancy may also predict who
could develop post-partum flare by dissecting the immunome.
