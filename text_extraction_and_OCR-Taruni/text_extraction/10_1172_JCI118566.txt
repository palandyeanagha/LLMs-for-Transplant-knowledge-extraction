Abstract
Chronic renal failure (CRF) is associated with negative ni￾trogen balance and loss of lean body mass. To identify spe￾cific proteolytic pathways activated by CRF, protein degra￾dation was measured in incubated epitrochlearis muscles
from CRF and sham-operated, pair-fed rats. CRF stimu￾lated muscle proteolysis, and inhibition of lysosomal and
calcium-activated proteases did not eliminate this increase.
When ATP production was blocked, proteolysis in CRF
muscles fell to the same level as that in control muscles. In￾creased proteolysis was also prevented by feeding CRF rats
sodium bicarbonate, suggesting that activation depends on
acidification. Evidence that the ATP-dependent ubiquitin–
proteasome pathway is stimulated by the acidemia of CRF
includes the following findings: (a) An inhibitor of the pro￾teasome eliminated the increase in muscle proteolysis; and
(b) there was an increase in mRNAs encoding ubiquitin
(324%) and proteasome subunits C3 (137%) and C9 (251%)
in muscle. This response involved gene activation since
transcription of mRNAs for ubiquitin and the C3 subunit
were selectively increased in muscle of CRF rats. We con￾clude that CRF stimulates muscle proteolysis by activating
the ATP–ubiquitin–proteasome–dependent pathway. The
mechanism depends on acidification and increased expres￾sion of genes encoding components of the system. These re￾sponses could contribute to the loss of muscle mass associ￾ated with CRF. (J. Clin. Invest. 1996. 97:1447–1453.) Key

Introduction
Increased protein catabolism and negative nitrogen balance
are characteristic of chronic renal failure (CRF).1
 Early studies
by Coles documented that CRF patients had low serum pro￾teins and loss of lean body mass (1). Anthropometric measure￾ments reveal that hemodialysis patients have a reduced muscle
mass (2, 3), and Williams et al. reported that patients with
CRF complicated by metabolic acidosis have increased excre￾tion of 3-methylhistidine (4). They concluded that this repre￾sented excessive muscle protein catabolism, resulting in nega￾tive nitrogen balance. Despite documentation of the problem
in patients, cellular processes causing protein catabolism in
CRF remain poorly understood. In particular, the proteolytic
pathways activated by CRF and the signals resulting in activa￾tion of protein degradation have not been identified.
In muscle, there are at least four pathways that can degrade
proteins: lysosomal, calcium-activated proteases, ATP-depen￾dent, and ATP-independent proteolytic pathways (5). Endocy￾tosed proteins are degraded by lysosomal proteases, whereas
calcium-activated proteases seem to be important in certain
types of muscular dystrophy and in the response to muscle
damage (6–8). The ATP-dependent pathways include the
ubiquitin–proteasome system, which degrades abnormal and
short-lived proteins (9–12). This pathway involves a soluble,
multienzyme system that requires ATP (9). Proteins to be de￾graded are covalently linked to multiple ubiquitins by a ubiq￾uitin–conjugase complex, and degradation occurs in the 26S
proteasome complex (9, 10, 12). Little is known about the
ATP-independent proteolytic systems (5, 13). 
When normal rats were fed NH4Cl to induce metabolic aci￾dosis, we found that muscle protein degradation was in￾creased. When muscles from these rats were depleted of ATP,
the increase in protein degradation was abolished (14, 15). We
also found increased levels of mRNAs encoding both ubiquitin
and subunits of the proteasome, suggesting that the increase in
muscle protein degradation involved the ubiquitin–protea￾some pathway. These results obtained in studies of rats fed
NH4Cl may be relevant to the catabolism associated with CRF
because we have also found that muscle protein degradation is
increased in rats with experimental CRF and that adding so￾dium bicarbonate to their diet eliminated the excess protein
breakdown (16). In that study, we did not identify the pro￾teolytic pathway activated by CRF. 
Increases in both muscle protein degradation and levels of
mRNAs encoding components of the ubiquitin–proteasome
pathway have been found in association with other catabolic
conditions, including sepsis (17), cancer (18–20), burns (21),
starvation, and denervation (22). Consequently, insights into
the mechanisms leading to increased mRNAs for components
of this pathway could have widespread interest. 
The present experiments were designed to explore which
proteolytic pathway is activated by CRF as well as the mecha￾nism of activation. In studies of rats after subtotal nephrec￾tomy, we used a pair-feeding strategy to eliminate the influ￾ence of variations in dietary protein, which can change protein
turnover in muscle (22, 23). There was direct evidence that

CRF stimulates muscle protein degradation by activating the
ubiquitin–proteasome system, including up-regulation of ex￾pression of genes encoding components of this system.
Methods
Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 50–75 g obtained from Charles
River Laboratories (Raleigh, NC) were housed in temperature-con￾trolled quarters with a 12-h light–dark cycle. Water and 23% protein
pellets (Purina Animal Chow, Inc., Chicago, IL) were provided ad li￾bitum. Rats, anesthetized with 60 mg ketamine and 12 mg xylazine/kg
intraperitoneally, underwent a right nephrectomy through a flank in￾cision and were fed ad libitum 8% protein chow prepared by mixing
36% ground pellet chow (Agway 2000, Madison, WI) and 64% dex￾trin (U.S. Biochem. Corp., Cleveland, OH). 1 wk later, rats were
anesthetized and branches of the left renal artery were ligated to pro￾duce a 7/8 nephrectomy. After surgery, the rats resumed the 8% pro￾tein diet and were given 0.225 g/dl NaCl to drink. 10 d later, rats were
paired by weight to rats that had their abdomen opened and the kid￾neys manipulated but not damaged (sham-operated [SO] rats). CRF
and SO rats were pair-fed a high protein diet for at least 2 wk before
the experiment to induce azotemia and acidosis (16). The diet con￾tained 46% protein, consisting of 35% casein (Teklad Premier Labo￾ratory Diets, Madison, WI), 25% dextrin, and 40% ground pellet
chow. After 5 d of pair feeding, tail vein blood was assayed for urea
concentration (16).
In experiments 1 and 2, CRF and pair-fed SO rats were fasted
overnight and anesthetized, and their epitrochlearis muscles were re￾moved to measure protein degradation as tyrosine released during an
incubation (see below). In a third experiment, we examined whether
tyrosine accumulates in muscle under different incubation conditions
because tyrosine accumulation could confound the measurement of
protein degradation. CRF and control rats were treated in the same
fashion, except that after the incubation, epitrochlearis muscles were
frozen in liquid N2
 and stored at 2708C until they were homogenized
in perchloric acid containing fluorophenylalanine as an internal stan￾dard. After neutralization of the clear supernatant with KHCO3
, the
intracellular content of free tyrosine was measured by HPLC as de￾scribed (24). In a fourth experiment, CRF rats were randomly as￾signed to group I (CRF rats fed the high-protein diet and given 0.25
normal saline to drink) or group II (CRF rats pair fed the same diet
but with 1.7 g NaHCO3
/100 g chow and given 0.125% NaHCO3
 to
drink). Group III rats were sham operated and pair fed with group I
rats. In the fifth experiment, seven CRF and pair-fed SO rats were
studied by incubating their muscles with an inhibitor of the protea￾some (benzyloxycarbonyl-leucine-leucine-leucinal [MG132], kindly
provided by ProScript, Inc., Cambridge, MA).
Epitrochlearis muscle incubations. In experiment 1, epitrochlearis
muscles from anesthetized rats were dissected, fixed at resting length
on a plastic support, and incubated in KRB with or without inhibitors
of lysosomal and calcium-activated proteases (15, 25, 26). Calcium￾dependent and lysosomal proteases were inhibited by deleting cal￾cium from the KRB and adding 50 mM of trans-epoxysuccinyl-l￾leucylamido-(4-guanidino butane), E-64, a potent inhibitor of the
calpains, as well as the lysosomal proteases cathepsins B, H, and L
(26). Lysosomal function was also inhibited by adding 1 mU/ml insu￾lin, 200 mM valine, 170 mM leucine, 100 mM isoleucine, and 10 mM
methylamine (13, 25). To measure total protein degradation, 0.5 mM
cycloheximide was added because this concentration inhibits protein
synthesis in incubated rat muscles (27), thereby preventing reutiliza￾tion of tyrosine released during degradation of muscle proteins. After
preincubation (30 min), each muscle was transferred to a flask con￾taining fresh media and incubated at 378C for a 2-h experimental pe￾riod. All flasks were gassed with 95%O2
/5%CO2
 for 3 min at the be￾ginning of the preincubation and experimental periods. After the
experimental period, media samples were collected and TCA (final
concentration, 5%) was added to precipitate protein. The rate of pro￾tein degradation was measured as tyrosine released into the media;
tyrosine was measured by fluorometry (28).
In experiment 2, another group of CRF and pair-fed SO rats was
studied to assess the contribution of the nonlysosomal, ATP-depen￾dent proteolytic process. Muscles were fixed at resting length and in￾cubated under the conditions described above to block both the lyso￾somal and calcium-dependent proteolytic systems. The contralateral
muscle was incubated under the same conditions but also depleted of
ATP (preincubation for 1 h and then incubation for 2 h in the same
media except that the glucose was replaced by 5 mM 2-deoxyglucose,
and 0.5 mM DNP was added). These conditions reduced the ATP
content in muscle to , 10% of normal values (unpublished observa￾tions). The difference in rates of proteolysis was taken to represent
the ATP-dependent component.
To test whether the proteasome is involved in protein catabolism
stimulated by CRF, we used a peptidyl aldehyde inhibitor of the pro￾teasome, MG 132. Epitrochlearis muscles from CRF and SO pair-fed
rats were incubated in calcium-free KRB, containing 10 mM glucose,
0.5 mM cycloheximide, and MG 132 (30 mM, final concentration) dis￾solved in DMSO. The contralateral muscle was incubated in the same
media containing an equivalent amount of DMSO but no inhibitor.
After preincubation in the media for 30 min, the experimental period
was 2 h.
RNA isolation and analysis. After removal of the epitrochlearis
muscle, the gastrocnemius muscles were removed and immediately
freeze-clamped in liquid nitrogen. Hindquarter muscles were studied
because they, like the epitrochlearis muscle, contain mixed fibers, and
the hindquarter exhibits similar responses in terms of muscle protein
turnover (28). Total RNA was isolated using TriReagent (Molecular
Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH); the quantity and purity of
RNA were assessed by measuring absorption at 260 and 280 nm.
RNA was separated by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose/formalde￾hyde gel, transferred to Zeta Probe GT Nylon membranes (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA), and cross-linked to the membrane by
UV irradiation. Membranes were hybridized sequentially with cDNA
probes for human ubiquitin and rat proteasome subunits C2, C3, C9,
and glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in a solu￾tion containing 53 SSC, 53 Denhardt’s solution (13 5 0.02% Ficoll,
0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.02% BSA), 7% SDS, 50% deionized
formamide, 10% polyethylene glycol, and 50 mg/ml denatured her￾ring testis DNA at 428C overnight. Subsequently, membranes were
washed once with 23 SSC, 0.5% SDS at 428C followed by two washes
with 0.23 SSC, 0.5% SDS at 658C for 20 min each. Autoradiographic
signals were quantified by densitometry and expressed relative to the
corresponding GAPDH mRNA value to correct for variations in
RNA loading and transfer. GAPDH mRNA was used because we
previously found that mRNA levels in muscle with this model of CRF
do not change (29). 
Transcription assays. Pair-fed SO and CRF rats (16) were anes￾thetized, and z 14 g of leg and back muscles or 5 g of liver was rapidly
removed. Tissues were minced with scissors and homogenized at low
speed with a Polytron (Brinkmann Instruments, Inc., Westbury, NY)
in an ice-cold lysis buffer composed of 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mM
KCl, 10 mM MgCl2
, and 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol. Nuclei were pel￾leted by centrifugation at 1,000 g for 8 min and then resuspended in
2.2 M sucrose. After centrifugation at 80,000 g for 90 min at 48C, the
nuclear pellets were washed in 75 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 60 mM KCl, 15
mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.5 mM
spermidine, 0.5 mM spermine, and 40% glycerol. The yield of nuclei
using this method was small relative to the tissue used.
Isolated nuclei were incubated at 258C for 30 min in a buffer con￾taining 60 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 55 mM KCl, 12 mM NaCl, 6.5 mM DTT,
0.08 mM EDTA, 0.08 mM EGTA, 0.4 mM spermine, 0.4 mM spermi￾dine, 5 mM MgCl2
, 0.6 mM ATP, 0.03 mM CTP, and 0.036 mM GTP,
with 40 U RNasin and 250 mCi [a￾32P]UTP (3,000 Ci/mmol). The
newly transcribed, 32P-labeled RNA was purified using TriReagent
and hybridized with cDNA probes (2 mg each) for rat GAPDH, hu￾man g-actin, human ubiquitin, and the rat proteasome C3 subunit im-

mobilized on a GT nylon membrane (Zeta-Probe; Bio-Rad Labora￾tories, Hercules, CA). To provide a negative hybridization control,
linearized pGEM3zf (Promega, Madison, WI) was also hybridized.
Hybridizations were performed in 0.12 M Na2HPO4
, 0.25 M NaCl, 53
Denhardt’s, 50% formamide, 10% SDS, 5% polyethylene glycol, and
50 mg/ml denatured herring DNA at 558C for 3 d. Subsequently, the
membranes were washed sequentially with 23 SSPE (13 5 0.15 M
NaCl, 0.01 M Na2HPO4
, 0.001 M EDTA) at 608C, 23 SSPE contain￾ing 25 mg/ml RNase A at room temperature, and 13 SSPE/0.1% SDS
at 608C for 30 min each. 
Statistics. Values are presented as mean6SEM. We compared re￾sults obtained in specific experiments by Student’s t test or ANOVA.
Our results, like those of other investigators (17, 19), reveal variabil￾ity in rates of muscle protein degradation in different experiments.
Presumably, this is related to different degrees of acidemia (see Table
I), renal insufficiency for varying periods, and differences in food in￾take. Although the impact of food intake is minimized because SO
rats were pair fed with CRF rats, it is not appropriate to compare re￾sults obtained in different experiments, and we only tested for statisti￾cal significance within each experimental group.
Results
During pair feeding, the CRF rats gained weight but at a
slightly lower rate than SO rats. In the first experiment, the av￾erage weight of the CRF rats at the beginning of pair feeding
was 10866 g vs 10565 g for the controls. At the conclusion,
the CRF rats weighed 134610 g vs 14166 g for the controls.
The average serum urea nitrogen in CRF rats was 140614 mg/
dl vs 2862 mg/dl in SO rats. The CRF rats fed supplemental
NaHCO3
 in the fourth experiment had an average weight of
94 g before pair feeding and gained 15 g before we measured
protein degradation. The average weight of the acidotic CRF
rats at the start of pair feeding was 94 g, and they gained an av￾erage of 8 g before we measured muscle protein degradation.
The SO pair-fed control rats weighing 113 g initially had the
largest weight gain, 17 g. The mean serum bicarbonate of the
acidotic CRF rats was 864 mM vs 2563 mM in CRF rats fed
NaHCO3
 and 2462 mM in SO pair-fed control rats.
 Muscle protein degradation in CRF. Previously, we found
that protein degradation in perfused hindquarter muscles from
fed, acidotic, CRF rats was about twofold higher than in mus￾cles of SO pair-fed rats (16). In the present experiments, the
CRF-induced increase in protein degradation (Table I) in in￾cubated epitrochlearis muscles was somewhat less. This vari￾ability in rates of muscle protein degradation has been noted
by others and points out why it is important to compare values
measured in CRF and pair-fed control rats in each experiment
(14, 16, 19, 20, 30). The rate of protein degradation induced by
CRF was still excessive when epitrochlearis muscles were incu￾bated with insulin, amino acids, methylamine, and E-64 to
block lysosomal and calcium-activated proteolysis (Table I).
ATP depletion eliminated this difference, suggesting that the
increase in protein degradation stimulated by CRF involved
an ATP-dependent pathway. The content of free tyrosine in
muscles incubated with or without inhibitors of proteolytic
pathways reveals that the differences in tyrosine release could
not be attributed to intracellular accumulation of tyrosine (Ta￾ble II). In fact, experimental conditions associated with a lower
rate of tyrosine release also had lower values of intracellular
tyrosine. Specifically, the decreased rate of tyrosine released
by ATP-depleted muscle reflects a decrease in protein degra￾dation rather than decreased efflux from the intracellular pool.
Since the cell content of amino acids varies with the amount of
dietary protein (24, 31), this factor may explain the higher val￾ues we obtained in epitrochlearis compared with values Tiao
et al. found in extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles of
rats fasted for 16 h (17).
Since our earlier study indicated that it was the acidosis of
CRF that activated muscle proteolysis (16), we tested whether

In Experiment 1, muscles of six pair-fed CRF and SO control rats were

branched-chain amino acids, methylamine, and E64 to block lysosomal
function and calcium-activated proteases. In Experiment 2, muscles of
five CRF and control rats were studied to compare the rates of protein
degradation when lysosomal function and calcium-activated proteases
were inhibited and when the muscles were incubated with the same me￾dia but 2-deoxyglucose was substituted for glucose and DNP was added
to deplete ATP (see Methods). *P , 0.05 compared with values mea￾sured in control rats by paired Student’s t test; ‡P , 0.05 compared with

eliminating acidosis would change the increase in ATP-depen￾dent proteolysis occurring in CRF. For this study, acidotic
CRF rats, CRF rats fed the NaHCO3 supplement, and pair-fed
control rats were compared. Protein degradation was mea￾sured in muscles incubated with methylamine and E64 in cal￾cium-free KRB containing cycloheximide, glucose, insulin, and
branched-chain amino acids to block lysosomal and calcium￾activated proteases, while muscles from the contralateral limb
were incubated in the same solution plus 2-deoxyglucose and
0.5 mM DNP but no glucose. In this experiment, proteolysis in
muscles from acidotic CRF rats was higher than in muscles of
CRF rats fed NaHCO3
 (Fig. 1). The rate of protein degrada￾tion in muscles of nonacidotic CRF rats was slightly but not
statistically higher than the rate in pair-fed control rats. When
ATP production in muscle was blocked, these differences were
eliminated.
In a final experiment, MG132, an inhibitor of the protea￾some (32), was used to document involvement of the ubiq￾uitin–proteasome pathway in this catabolic response to CRF.
In these studies, the mean serum bicarbonate of acidotic CRF
rats was 1362 mM vs 2461 mM for the pair-fed control rats
(P , 0.05). Again, acidotic CRF rats had the highest rates of
muscle protein degradation, and addition of MG132 elimi￾nated the difference in rates of protein degradation between
the two groups (Fig. 2). Elimination of the excessive proteoly￾sis of CRF was not an artifact because of accumulation of ty￾rosine in the intracellular pool of muscle (Table II), and we
found no evidence for toxic effects of MG132 on protein turn￾over. This conclusion is based on measurements of protein
synthesis in the presence of MG 132; protein synthesis
(37.563.8 nmol phenylalanine/g per h) in muscles of seven nor￾mal, fasted rats was similar to values we measured previously
(28) and did not change significantly (26.463.9 nmol phenyl￾alanine/g per h) in the contralateral muscle incubated with
MG132. We also measured the ATP content in muscles after
incubation. It averaged 3.4360.32 in muscles of five control
and 3.9860.49 mmol/g in muscles of four CRF rats, which is
within the range of values measured in epitrochlearis muscle
by Nesher et al. (33). By ANOVA, there was no significant dif￾ference in the ATP content when MG 132 was present
(3.5460.66, control; 2.5160.09 mmol/g, CRF).
Changes in mRNAs of the ubiquitin–proteasome system in
CRF. The results of hybridizing muscle mRNA with cDNAs
for ubiquitin, the C3 and C9 subunits of the proteasome, and
GAPDH are shown in Fig. 3. Previously, we showed that CRF
does not change GAPDH mRNA levels in rat muscle (29),
and, after accounting for variations in RNA loading and trans￾fer using GAPDH mRNA levels, we found that CRF induced
Figure 1. The CRF-induced increase in muscle protein degradation is 
ATP dependent and is activated by acidification. The increase in pro￾tein degradation persists when lysosomal function and calcium-acti￾vated proteases are inhibited (full height of bars) but is eliminated 
when muscles are incubated in the same media but with added 
2-deoxyglucose and DNP to deplete ATP (height of darkened bars). 
By ANOVA, *P , 0.01 compared with values measured in muscles 
of SO pair-fed control rats or CRF rats with NaHCO3

there were no significant differences in protein degradation measured 
in ATP-depleted muscles of the three groups of rats. 
Figure 2. The CRF-induced increase in muscle protein degradation is 
prevented by an inhibitor of the proteasome. Basal protein degrada￾tion was measured in epitrochlearis muscles and compared with val￾ues measured in the contralateral muscle incubated with the protea￾some inhibitor, MG 132. The difference in protein degradation 
between CRF and control muscles in the absence of inhibitor was sta￾tistically significant by t test (P , 0.05); there was no difference when 
the inhibitor was present.

GAPDH cDNAs. Previously, we showed that the ubiquitin cDNA 
probe used for these studies detects multiple species of polyubiquitin 
mRNA in muscle (15).

a 324% rise in mRNA for ubiquitin (n 5 5 for each group of
rats). There was no increase in ubiquitin mRNA in muscles of
CRF rats fed the NaHCO3
 supplement (Fig. 3). Similar results
were obtained with cDNAs of the proteasome subunits (C3,
137%; C9, 251%; P , 0.05 vs control values); we found no in￾crease in mRNA for the C2 subunit of the proteasome.
To evaluate whether the CRF-induced increase in the lev￾els of mRNAs encoding components of the ubiquitin–protea￾some pathway involve an increase in gene transcription, nu￾clear run-on experiments were performed using nuclei from
muscle and liver of CRF or pair-fed control rats. There was no
significant difference in the quantity of GAPDH or g-actin
mRNAs transcribed from nuclei isolated from muscles or liv￾ers of CRF and control rats. In contrast, CRF was associated
with an increase in transcribed ubiquitin and C3 proteasome
subunit mRNAs in muscle. A representative blot is shown in
Fig. 4. In liver, CRF was not associated with an increase in the
transcription of GAPDH, g-actin, ubiquitin, or C3 genes (data
not shown).
Discussion
Our results provide evidence that the metabolic acidosis of
CRF stimulates ATP-dependent proteolysis in muscle and,
more specifically, proteolysis involving the proteasome, be￾cause the inhibitor of proteasome activity blocked this re￾sponse. Moreover, metabolic acidosis in CRF is associated
with an increase in the muscle content of mRNAs encoding
ubiquitin and subunits of the proteasome. These responses
were reversed by feeding chow mixed with NaHCO3
 to correct
the acidosis of CRF, pointing to acidification as a stimulus for
these responses. Finally, we investigated the mechanisms for
the higher levels of mRNAs encoding components of the ubiq￾uitin–proteasome system and found coordinated increases in
transcription of these genes in muscle. It is tempting to specu￾late that the higher levels of mRNAs encoding elements of this
proteolytic system occurring in muscle in other catabolic con￾ditions (e.g., sepsis, cancer, fasting, etc.) also arise from in￾creased transcription, but this has not been shown experimen￾tally. Thus, our results indicate that the metabolic acidosis of
CRF activates a specific catabolic pathway in muscle and the
transcription of genes encoding components of the pathway.
These responses could compromise the ability of the organism
to maintain muscle mass (34).
The first set of experiments included muscles in which lyso￾somal and calcium-dependent proteolytic pathways were in￾hibited so the relative contribution of ATP-independent and
ATP-dependent proteolytic systems could be evaluated. The
decrease in protein degradation associated with inhibition of
lysosomal function and calcium-activated proteases was
greater in muscles of CRF compared with SO pair-fed rats. By
unpaired Student’s t test, this difference was not statistically
significant, but assessing the contribution of lysosomes and cal￾cium-activated proteases by evaluating differences in pro￾teolytic activity could obscure some influence of CRF on these
pathways. However, results in Figs. 1 and 2 and Table I indi￾cate that the major contributor to excess proteolysis is activa￾tion of the ATP–ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. Since the re￾sidual rates of protein degradation in muscles of CRF and
control rats did not differ significantly after inhibition of ATP
production, we conclude that CRF stimulates ATP-dependent
proteolysis. These results suggest that even a modest degree of
acidification in CRF is deleterious because this pathway was
stimulated even in CRF rats with an average serum bicarbon￾ate of 20 mM. 
The initial experiments did not identify which pathway is
involved in the accelerated ATP-dependent proteolysis, al￾though our earlier results in acidemic rats suggested it was
likely to be the ubiquitin–proteasome system (15). The addi￾tion of an inhibitor of proteasome function, MG 132, provides
more direct evidence for activation of this system because it
eliminated the CRF-induced increase in muscle protein degra￾dation. Like other peptide aldehyde inhibitors, MG 132 readily
crosses cell membranes and inhibits the proteolytic activity of
both 20S and 26S proteasomes (the latter form degrades ubiq￾uitin–protein conjugates) (32, 35–37). The specificity of the re￾action with an inhibitor (including the reaction between MG
132 and the proteasome) is always a potential problem, but
this class of compounds has been used to demonstrate that the
proteasome is involved in regulating the cell cycle, the process￾ing of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regula￾tor, and in antigen processing in macrophages (32, 36–38). In
muscles from control rats, MG 132 reduced protein degrada￾tion sharply, which is consistent with the suggestion that the
20S and 26S proteasome complexes are responsible for the
turnover of the bulk of protein in cells (e.g., normal muscle)
(32). The apparent reduction in the rate of protein degradation
below the level achieved by ATP depletion could represent
degradation in the 20S proteasome that can function without
ATP since this class of inhibitor will block both the 20S and
26S form of the proteasome (32, 36, 37).
Increased levels of mRNAs encoding ubiquitin and compo￾nents of the proteasome in muscles of CRF acidotic rats com￾pared with pair-fed CRF rats given NaHCO3
 or SO control
rats provide additional evidence for activation of the ubiq￾uitin–proteasome pathway (Fig. 3). These responses cannot be
attributed to dietary differences, as all groups were pair fed
and gained weight (albeit at different rates). Furthermore,
gene transcription for ubiquitin and the C3 proteasome sub￾unit was increased in muscle while that for g-actin and
GAPDH was unchanged; this was consistent with the CRF￾induced changes in mRNAs. Similar changes in gene transcrip￾tion were not detected in liver from CRF rats, suggesting that
this catabolic response appears to be specific for muscle and
Figure 4. CRF selec￾tively increases tran￾scription of ubiquitin 
and the C3 proteasome 
subunit genes in muscle. 
Shown are autoradio￾graphic results from nu￾clear run-on assays per￾formed using nuclei 
isolated from muscle of 
one CRF or pair-fed 
control rat. Transcrip￾tion of the ubiquitin and 
proteasome C3 subunit 
genes was increased in 
CRF rat muscle, but there was no change in the rate of transcription 
of the g-actin or GAPDH genes. pGEM3zf was included as a control 
for nonspecific hybridization. These results are representative of 
those obtained from three pairs of CRF and pair-fed SO rats.

not part of a generalized response to stress. Additional support
for this conclusion is given by our finding that muscle DNA
and RNA contents are unaltered by CRF (29).
Do these changes in protein degradation, the mRNA levels
of ubiquitin and subunits of the proteasome, and gene tran￾scription occur in all types of skeletal muscle? Unfortunately,
the amount of muscle and the methods required to measure
these responses in the same muscle prevented us from arriving
at an easy answer. However, we predict that these changes oc￾cur in most types of skeletal muscle for the following reasons:
(a) The epitrochlearis muscle we used to measure protein deg￾radation and the gastrocnemius used for RNA analyses con￾tain both red and white types of muscle fiber (33, 39), and pro￾tein degradation in mixed-fiber muscles responds similarly to
fasting and acute uremia (28, 40); (b) we found that mRNAs of
ubiquitin and proteasome subunits in the predominantly
white-fiber EDL and mixed-fiber gastrocnemius muscles in￾crease in response to acidemia and glucocorticoids (41); and
(c) in response to another catabolic condition, starvation, pro￾tein degradation and mRNAs of components of the ubiquitin–
proteasome system are increased in EDL and in the red-fiber
soleus muscle of rats (30, 42).
Taken together, our results suggest that the loss of muscle
mass associated with CRF is related to up-regulation of the
ATP–ubiquitin–proteasome–dependent pathway. What is the
signal for these responses? Our previous work suggests that
metabolic acidosis in CRF does not cause a sustained alter￾ation in the intracellular pH of muscle (43). On the other hand,
we did find that induction of acidosis by feeding NH4Cl to
adrenalectomized rats is not sufficient by itself to activate pro￾tein degradation or increase mRNAs of the ubiquitin–protea￾some pathway in muscle (14, 41). In both cases, glucocorticoids
must be provided, but the same dose of glucocorticoids given
to nonacidotic adrenalectomized rats does not cause these re￾sponses. Presumably, glucocorticoids are also involved in the
response to CRF since the steady-state production of cortico￾sterone (measured as its excretion) by CRF rats with or with￾out supplemental NaHCO3
 exceeds that of pair-fed control
rats (16). Moreover, in CRF patients, Garibotto et al. (44)
found a strong positive correlation between muscle protein
degradation and plasma levels of cortisol but a negative corre￾lation with serum bicarbonate, suggesting that both acidosis
and glucocorticoids are needed to stimulate muscle protein
degradation.
In summary, these results provide evidence that CRF acti￾vates the ubiquitin–proteasome proteolytic pathway. The pri￾mary catabolic stimulus was shown to be a response to acidifi￾cation rather than the accumulation of other waste products.
Several catabolic conditions (e.g., burns, sepsis, cancer, etc.)
are associated with increased levels of mRNAs encoding pro￾teins of the ubiquitin–proteasome system. Understanding the
mechanisms for activation of the pathway and increased tran￾scription of these genes could lead to more effective therapy
for conditions like CRF, which are associated with loss of mus￾cle mass.
