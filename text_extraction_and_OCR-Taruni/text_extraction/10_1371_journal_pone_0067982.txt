Abstract
Our previous studies demonstrated that the cell culture-grown hepatitis C virus of genotype 2a (HCVcc) uses apolipoprotein
E (apoE) to mediate its attachment to the surface of human hepatoma Huh-7.5 cells. ApoE mediates HCV attachment by
binding to the cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) which is covalently attached to the core proteins of proteoglycans (HSPGs).
In the present study, we further determined the physiological importance of apoE and HSPGs in the HCV attachment using
a clinical HCV of genotype 1b (HCV1b) obtained from hepatitis C patients and human embryonic stem cell-differentiated
hepatocyte-like cells (DHHs). DHHs were found to resemble primary human hepatocytes. Similar to HCVcc, HCV1b was
found to attach to the surface of DHHs by the apoE-mediated binding to the cell surface HSPGs. The apoE-specific
monoclonal antibody, purified HSPGs, and heparin were all able to efficiently block HCV1b attachment to DHHs. Similarly,
the removal of heparan sulfate from cell surface by treatment with heparinase suppressed HCV1b attachment to DHHs.
More significantly, HCV1b attachment was potently inhibited by a synthetic peptide derived from the apoE receptor￾binding region as well as by an HSPG-binding peptide. Likewise, the HSPG-binding peptide prevented apoE from binding to
heparin in a dose-dependent manner, as determined by an in vitro heparin pull-down assay. Collectively, these findings
demonstrate that HSPGs serve as major HCV attachment receptors on the surface of human hepatocytes to which the apoE
protein ligand on the HCV envelope binds.

Introduction
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) chronically infects 170 million people
worldwide, resulting in hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular
carcinoma [1]. The current optimal care of hepatitis C is a
combination therapy with pegylated interferon-a (IFN-a), ribavi￾rin, and one of the HCV NS3 protease inhibitors boceprevir and
telaprevir. However, both IFN-a and ribavirin cause severe side
effects, limiting their clinical benefits because of the toxicity￾associated intolerance among many hepatitis C patients [2]. A
number of novel HCV-specific inhibitors targeting NS3 protease,
NS5A protein, and NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase were
discovered and have advanced to late stages of clinical studies [3].
It is anticipated that some of the HCV-specific antiviral drugs will
be approved for treatment of hepatitis C in coming years. Ideally,
future therapies for hepatitis C shall combine HCV-specific
antiviral drugs targeting different viral proteins independently of
IFN [2].
HCV is the prototype member of the hepacivirus genus in the
Flaviviridea family. It is an enveloped RNA virus containing a single
positive-sense RNA genome. Upon translation, the HCV poly￾protein precursor of 3,000 amino acids is cleaved by cellular and
viral proteases, resulting in individual structural (C, E1, and E2),
p7, and nonstructural (NS) proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B,
NS5A, and NS5B) [4]. The NS3/4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B are
known to be the minimal set of viral proteins essential for HCV
RNA replication [5]. The viral structural and NS proteins play
important roles in HCV morphogenesis although the underlying
mechanism of NS proteins in HCV virion assembly has not been
defined [6]. The untranslated regions (UTRs) flanked at both the
59 and 39 ends of the HCV RNA genome function as cis-acting
RNA elements required for the initiation of HCV protein
translation as well as viral RNA replication [4].
Besides viral proteins, many cellular proteins were identified to
be critical for the HCV life cycle and/or viral pathogenesis [4,7].
Substantial evidence derived from our previous studies suggests
that the cellular protein apolipoprotein E (apoE) plays important
roles in both HCV infection and virion assembly [8–12]. Initially,
apoE was found to be enriched in infectious HCV particles and
correlated very nicely with the HCV infectivity [9]. Our studies
also suggested that apoE is a structural component of HCV virions
as determined by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) of HCV virions
with an apoE monoclonal antibody and its sensitivity to trypsin

digestion [11]. The structural nature of apoE was further
confirmed by immunogold electronic microscopy studies which
visualized apoE on the HCV envelope [13,14]. Additionally, we
have demonstrated that the apoE binds HCV NS5A and the
apoE-NS5A interaction is important for HCV virion assembly and
production [8,10,11]. Through deletion and site-specific muta￾genesis studies, the C-terminal a-helical domain of apoE was
found to be important for NS5A binding and HCV virion
assembly [10]. Consistent with these findings, apoE was recently
shown to be the only apolipoprotein required for HCV production
when expressed in nonhepatic 293T cells [15]. The importance of
apoE in HCV infection was confirmed by recent findings that the
apoE peptides derived from its receptor-binding domain potently
inhibited HCV attachment to the cell surface [12,16]. Our recent
work also demonstrated that apoE on HCV virions mediates the
HCV attachment via binding to the cell surface heparin sulfate
(HS) [12], which was previously found important for HCV
infection [17–19]. In this study, we further determined the
physiological importance of apoE and HSPGs in HCV attachment
using clinical HCV of genotype 1b derived from hepatitis C
patients and human embryonic stem cell-differentiated hepato￾cyte-like cells (DHHs) [20]. Results obtained from our experiments
demonstrate that apoE mediates the attachment of clinical HCV
of genotype 1b to the surface of DHHs, suggesting its importance
in HCV infection in vivo.
Materials and Methods
Cells
Human embryonic stem cell (hESCs) line WA09 (H9) was
obtained from WiCell Research Institute and maintained on
Geltrex coated culture plates in Stem Pro medium (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). The Huh-7, Huh-7.5, and HEK293 cells were
maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Hyclone)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Germini), 0.1 mM
nonessential amino acids, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml
streptomycin at 37uC in 5% CO2 incubator.
Viruses
The patient serum containing HCV of genotype 1b (HCV1b)
was obtained from a commercial supplier (Teragenix, Ft. Lauder￾dale, FL) [20].
Antibodies and Chemicals
ApoE-specific monoclonal antibody 23 (mAb23) and WuE4
(ATCC) were produced in the lab as previously described [9].
Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and
heparin-conjugated beads were from Pierce. ApoE peptides of
21 amino acids are derived from the receptor-binding region from
amino acid residue 130 to 150. Both hEP and hEPm peptides
derived from apoE were described previously [16]. The HSPG￾binding peptide was obtained from the exon 6a-encoding domain
of the vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF). Peptides
were synthesized by Biomatik with a purity of 95%. Heparinase I,
HSPG (isolated from basement membrane of Engelbreth-Holm￾Swarm mouse sarcoma), and Heparin (ammonium salt from
porcine intestinal mucosa) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Differentiation of hESCs into Hepatocyte-like Cells
The differentiation of hESCs into hepatocytes has been
described previously [20]. Briefly, the base defined medium
(DM) consists of DMEM/F12 containing 10% Probumin, 0.2% b￾Mercaptoethanol, 1% L-Alanyl-L-Glutamine and 2% hESC
supplements. Confluent cells were harvested with Accutase and
then plated into culture dishes (Costar; Corning Life Sciences)
precoated with Geltrex (1:200 dilution in DMEM/F-12) in Stem
Pro medium at a confluence level of 30–40%. The next day,
culture medium was changed to medium A (DM+100 ng/ml
Activin-A+8 ng/ml b-FGF+25 ng/ml Wnt-3A) for 24 hrs, fol￾lowed by three days in medium B (DM+100 ng/ml Activin￾A+8 ng/ml b-FGF). To induce hepatic differentiation, we then
cultured cells in the presence of medium C (DM+50 ng/ml FGF￾10) for three days and then in the presence of medium D
(DM+50 ng/ml FGF-10+0.1 mM RA+1 mM SB431542) for three
more days. The immature hepatocyte-like cells were then split 1:2
and grown in medium E (DM+30 ng/ml FGF-4+50 ng/ml
EGF+50 ng/ml HGF) for 10 days with changes to fresh medium
E every two to three days.
HCV Attachment Assay
Cell culture plates were coated with either Geltrex (1:200
dilution in DMEM/F-12) or 0.1 mg/ml of poly-L-lysine (Sigma￾Aldrich). The hESCs differentiated human hepatocytes (DHHs) or
Huh-7.5 cells in 12-well cell culture plates were incubated with
HCV1b or HCVcc in the absence or presence of indicated
peptides at 4uC (on ice) for 2 hours (hrs). The unbound HCV was
removed by aspiration and washing cells with PBS for three times.
The virion RNA (vRNA) of cell-bound HCV was isolated with a
Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen) or RNAzol Reagent (Molecular
Research Center). The levels of HCV vRNA were determined
by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(qRT-PCR) method.
Removal of Heparan Sulfate by Heparinase
DHHs in a 12-well cell culture plate were washed with DPBS
and then incubated with various concentrations of heparinase I in
a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 50 mM NaCl,
4 mM CaCl2 and 0.01% bovine serum albumin at 37uC for 1 hr
[18]. The heparinase-containing buffer was removed, and cells
were washed three times with PBS. The heparinase-treated DHHs
were incubated with HCV1b on ice for 2 hrs. The unbound HCV
was removed, and the cells were washed three times with DPBS.
The vRNA of the cell-bound HCV was extracted with Trizol
Reagent (Invitrogen) and quantified by qRT-PCR using the
StepOnePlus real-time PCR system.
Inhibition of HCV Attachment by Heparin and GAGs
To determine whether heparin or GAGs inhibits HCV
attachment to DHHs or Huh7.5 cells, infectious HCV reacted
with different concentrations of heparin or GAGs in a final volume
of 0.5 ml/well at 4uC (on ice) for 1 hr was added onto cells in 12-
well plates at 4uC (on ice) for 2 hrs to allow binding. The unbound
HCV was removed by aspiration and washing cells with PBS three
times. The virion RNA (vRNA) of cell-bound HCV was isolated
with a Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen) or RNAzol Reagent (Molecular
Research Center). The levels of HCV vRNA were determined by
quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(qRT-PCR) method.
HCV vRNA Extraction and Quantification by qRT-PCR
Total RNAs were extracted from the HCV-infected cells using a
Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen) or RNAzol Reagent (Molecular
Research Center). The level of HCV1b vRNA was quantified by
a one-step real-time RT-PCR method using SuperScriptH III
PlatinumH SYBRH Green One-Step qPCR Kit w/ROX (Invitro￾gen). The oligonucleotide primers were NS3 1b-F (59-
GTCGTGCTGGCCACCGCTAC-39) and NS3 1b-R (59-

CCTCCCCCCCTTGATGGTCTC-39. Reactions were run in a
StepOnePlus real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) using the
cycle conditions provided by the qPCR kit. An endogenous gene
GAPDH was also determined using Hu-GAPDH primer/probe
mix containing vic-TAMRA (Applied Biosystems). The levels of
HCV vRNA were normalized to the level of GAPGH.
Western Blot Analysis
Protein concentration of cell lysate was determined using a
protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). Equal amount of total protein for
each sample was analyzed by electrophoresis in 10% SDS-PAGE.
Separated proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene
difluoride (PVDF) membrane using a semidry blotter. After
blocking with 5% dry milk, immunoblot analysis of apoE was
done using apoE-specific mAb WuE4 and an enhanced chemilu￾minescence kit (Pierce).
Heparin Pull-down Assay
Heparin-immobilized beads (Pierce) were pre-equilibrated with
PBS and then incubated with 500 ml of cell culture medium from
Huh-7.5 cells in the absence or presence of HSPG peptides. After
2 hrs incubation at room temperature, apoE-bound beads were
spin down, while the supernatant was collected and used for
detection of unbound apoE protein. The apoE-bound beads in
pellet were washed with 1 ml of PBS for three times. Heparin￾bound and unbound apoE proteins were detected by Western
blotting using the WuE4 monoclonal antibody.
Assay for apoE Binding to Huh7 Cells
The supernatant from Huh-7 cells contained apoE lipoproteins
and was used as apoE ligand. The Huh-7 cell supernatant was
clarified by passing through a 0.45 mM Cellulous Acetate filter
(Corning). The clarified supernatant was then concentrated (56)
using AmiconH Ultra-4 (10KD) (Millipore). The concentrated
Huh7 cell supernatant (Huh7Sup) was then used for the
determination of the effects of apoE mAb23 and the HSPG￾binding peptide 6a-P on the binding of apoE to huh-7 cells, in
which the endogenous expression of apoE was silenced by
transfection with an apoE- specific siRNA, as previously described
[9]. A nonspecific control (NSC) siRNA was used as a negative
control. Briefly, Huh7 cells in 6-well plates were transfected with
0.05 nmol siRNA using RNAiMax transfection reagent (Invitro￾gen). At 48 hrs post-transfection (p.t.), cells were scraped and
washed with cold PBS. To determine the effect of apoE mAb23 on
the binding of apoE to Huh-7 cells, the siRNA-transfected Huh-7
cells were incubated with Huh7Sup, which was pre-incubated with
mAb23 or mIgG at 4uC for 1 hr. To examine the activity of the
HSPG-binding peptide 6a-P to block apoE binding to Huh-7 cells,
Huh7sup was incubated with the siRNA-transfected Huh-7 cells in
the presence of varying concentrations of 6a-P or 6a-Pm at 4uC for
1 hr. The unbound apoE was removed by aspiration and washing
with cold PBS for three times. The cells were lysed in RIPA buffer
containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Roche). The levels of
apoE and b-actin were subsequently determined by Western
blotting.
Results
Blockade of HCV1b Cell Attachment by an apoE-specific
Monoclonal Antibody
Our previous studies found that the apoE-blocking monoclonal
antibody mAb23 could efficiently inhibit the binding of the cell
culture-grown HCV of genotype 2a (HCVcc) to the surface of
Huh-7.5 cells, suggesting that apoE mediates HCV attachment to
cell surface receptors [12]. To further corroborate the physiolog￾ical importance of apoE in the mediation of HCV attachment, we
carried out HCV binding studies using a clinical HCV of genotype
1b obtained from hepatitis C patients together with human
embryonic stem cell-differentiated hepatocyte-like cells (DHHs).
DHH was previously shown to resemble primary human
hepatocytes in many aspects, including its permissiveness to
infection of clinical HCV isolates [20,21]. Similar to its
neutralizing activity against HCVcc attachment, mAB23 potently
blocked the attachment of HCV1b to the surface of DHHs in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1). In contrast to normal mouse
IgG1, 10 mg/ml of mAb23 resulted in over 70% reduction of
HCV1b vRNA (Fig. 1). These results demonstrate that apoE is not
only important for HCVcc attachment to Huh-7.5 cells but more
importantly also for the attachment of HCV1b to the surface of
DHHs. It is most likely that apoE mediates HCV attachment to
human hepatocytes in vivo.
Importance of Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans (HSPGs) in
HCV1b Attachment to DHHs
Several previous studies suggested that HSPGs play an
important role in HCV absorption and uptake through interac￾tions with the HCV E2 protein [17,22]. Removal of the cell
surface heparan sulfate (HS) by pretreatment of cells with
heparinases resulted in an inhibition of HCV infection [18,19].
Additionally, our recent studies demonstrated that apoE anchored
on the HCV envelope actually mediates the attachment of HCVcc
to Huh-7.5 cells by binding to the cell surface heparan sulfate (HS)
[12]. To validate the role and underlying mechanism of HSPGs in
HCV infection, we determined the effects of purified HSPGs,
heparin, and removal of HS by heparinase treatment on HCV1b
attachment to DHHs. Results derived from these experiments
show that purified HSPGs did inhibit the attachment of HCV1b to
Figure 1. Blockade of HCV1b cell attachment by apoE
monoclonal antibody mAb23. DHHs at day-11 were incubated
with HCV1b in the absence (Control) or presence of 10 mg/ml of normal
mouse IgG1 (mIgG1) or increasing amounts of apoE mAb23 (0.4, 2, and
10 mg/ml) at 37uC for 2 hrs. The unbound HCV was removed by
washing cells with 1x PBS for three times. The vRNA of the cell-bound
HCV was extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). The levels of HCV
vRNA were quantified by a real-time RT-PCR method using SuperScriptH
III PlatinumH SYBRH Green One-Step qPCR Kit (Invitrogen). Reactions
were run in a StepOnePlus real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems)
using the conditions provided by the qPCR kit. A house-keeping gene
GAPDH was used as an internal control, which was quantified using Hu￾GAPDH primer/probe mix containing vic-TAMRA (Applied Biosystems).
The levels of HCV vRNA were calculated from the average data of three
experiments upon normalization with the level of GAPDH.

DHHs in a dose-dependent manner, lowering the HCV1b vRNA
by 60% at 40 mg/ml (Fig. 2A). Similarly, the HCV1b cell
attachment was suppressed by increasing concentrations of
heparin, which resulted in .70% decrease of HCV1b vRNA at
10 U/ml (Fig. 2B). Consistent with findings derived from studies
with HCVcc, removal of HS from the surface of DHHs by
pretreatment with varying concentrations of heparinase I also
proportionally blocked HCV1b attachment (Fig. 3). Taken
together, these results demonstrate that HSPGs are important
for HCV attachment to the cell surface and also suggest that
HSPGs act as receptors for HCV attachment to hepatocytes
in vivo.
Inhibition of HCV1b Attachment to DHHs by an apoE￾derived Peptide as Well as by an HSPG-binding Peptide
To further confirm the importance of apoE and HSPGs in
HCV1b attachment to DHHs, we sought to determine the effects
of a synthetic apoE-derived peptide and an HSPG-binding peptide
on HCV1b attachment. It was previously found that a synthetic
peptide of 21 amino acids derived from the apoE receptor-binding
domain (residues 130–150) specifically inhibited HCVcc attach￾ment to Huh-7.5 cells [12]. This finding was independently
confirmed by using longer peptides derived from the receptor- and
lipid-binding domains of apoE [16]. Therefore, we first deter￾mined the effect of the apoE-derived peptide (E3/21C) on HCV1b
attachment to DHHs. A mutant peptide (E3/21Cm) containing
lysine to glutamic acid mutations at apoE residues 143 and 146
was used as a control (Fig. 4A). Similar to HCVcc, HCV1b
attachment to DHHs was proportionally inhibited by increasing
concentrations of E3/21C peptide, resulting in about 80%
reduction of HCV1b vRNA at 60 mM concentration. However,
the mutant E3/21Cm peptide had no effect on HCV1b
attachment to DHHs (Fig. 4B). Next, we examined an HSPG￾binding peptide 6a-P corresponding to the exon 6a-encoded
domain of vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) using
HCV1b attachment assay (Fig. 4A). It was previously shown that
6a-P peptide bound strongly to heparin and prevented VEGF
binding to HSPGs on the surface of different cell types [23].
Compared to E3/21Cm peptide (Fig. 4B), 6a-P peptide similarly
suppressed the binding of HCV1b to DHHs, reducing 75% of
HCV1b vRNA at 60 mM concentration (Fig. 4C). These results
suggest that apoE on the viral envelope and HSPGs on the cell
surface are important for HCV1b attachment, consistent with our
earlier findings that apoE mediates HCVcc attachment via
binding to HSPGs on the surface of Huh-7.5 cells [12].
Blockade of in vitro apoE-heparin Interaction by a
Peptide Containing the apoE Receptor-Binding Domain
as Well as by the HSPG-binding Peptide 6a-P
HSPG is one of the apoE receptors [24]. We have previously
demonstrated that the receptor-binding domain of apoE is
Figure 2. Inhibition of HCV1b attachment to DHHs by purified
HSPG (A) and Heparin (B). The HCV1b was pre-incubated with
varying amounts of HSPG or Heparin for 1 hr on ice prior to adding to
day-11 DHHs in 12-well cell culture plates as described in materials and
methods. After incubation on ice for 2 hrs, the unbound HCV was
removed by washing cells with PBS for three times. The vRNA of the
cell-bound HCV was extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). The
levels of HCV1b vRNA were determined using the same real-time RT￾qPCR method as in Fig. 1.

0.01% bovine serum albumin at 37uC for 1 hr [18]. The heparinase￾treated DHHs were then incubated with HCV1b on ice for 2 hrs. The
unbound HCV was removed and the cells were washed with 1x PBS for
three times. The HCV1b vRNA of the cell-bound HCV was extracted with
Trizol reagent and quantified by RT-qPCR using the StepOnePlus real￾time PCR system same as that in Fig. 1.

responsible for HSPG-binding and HCV infection [12]. Mutations
within the apoE receptor-binding region, which impaired HCV
infectivity, resulted in inability of apoE to bind heparin in vitro
[12]. To provide additional direct evidence on the apoE and
HSPG interaction, we used a heparin pull-down assay to
determine the effects of apoE peptide and the HSPG-binding
peptide 6a-P on the apoE-heparin interaction. The apoE￾containing supernatant of Huh-7.5 cells was incubated with
heparin-immobilized beads in the presence or absence of peptides.
In the absence of any peptide, apoE was efficiently precipitated by
heparin-immobilized beads. However, hEP and 6a-P peptides
potently blocked the binding of apoE to heparin beads (Fig. 5A).
The blockade of the apoE-heparin interaction was proportional to
increasing concentrations of peptides (Fig. 5B). These results
suggest that the apoE receptor-bindings domain mediates specific
interactions with HSPG and therefore HCV attachment to the cell
surface of hepatocytes in vivo. It is also possible that HCV infection
may be prophylactically preventable by inhibitors of the apoE￾HSPG interaction.
Suppression of the Binding of apoE to Huh-7 Cells by
apoE-specific mAb23 and the HSPG-binding Peptide 6a-P
To validate apoE and HSPG interaction in the mediation of
HCV attachment, we determined the effects of apoE mAb23
(Fig. 1) and the HSPG-binding peptide 6a-P (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5) on
the binding of apoE to Huh-7 cells. The endogenous apoE
expression in Huh-7 cells was silenced by transfection with an
apoE-specific siRNA as previously described [9]. The apoE￾containing lipoproteins secreted to the supernatant of Huh-7 cells
were used as ligands. The apoE-containing supernatant of Huh-7
cells (Huh7Sup) was incubated with the siRNA-transfected Huh-7
cells in the presence of apoE-specific monoclonal antibody
(mAb23), normal mouse IgG (mIgG), the HSPG-binding peptide
6a-P, or the control peptide 6a-Pm, respectively (Fig. 6). Consis￾tent with the blockade of apoE and heparin interaction by the
peptide 6a-P (Fig. 5), both apoE mAb23 and peptide 6a-P
efficiently suppressed the binding of apoE to Huh-7 cells. In
contrast, the idiotype-matched normal mouse IgG (mIgG) and a
mutant peptide 6a-Pm did not affect the binding of apoE to Huh-7
cells (Fig. 6). These findings further support the conclusion that
apoE mediates HCV attachment by binding to HSPGs on the
surface of hepatocytes.
Discussion
HSPGs are localized on the cell surface and act as ubiquitous
protein ligands, including serving as attachment receptors for
many different viruses [25]. In the case of HCV, HSPGs were
previously found to be important for HCV infection although the
molecular mechanism underlying HSPGs in HCV infection was
not defined [17–19,22]. Our recent studies with a cell culture￾grown HCVcc of genotype 2a (JFH1) suggested that HSPGs
function as HCV attachment receptors on the surface of
hepatocytes and that apoE on the virus envelope serves as a
protein ligand mediating the initial binding of HCV to the cell
surface HSPGs [9,11,12]. The physiological importance of apoE,
HSPGs, and their interactions in vivo are further supported by
several lines of evidence obtained from the present study with
HCV of genotype 1b derived from hepatitis C patients in
conjunction with DHHs which resemble primary human hepato￾cytes. First of all, the attachment of a clinical HCV isolate of
genotype 1b to DHHs was efficiently blocked by an apoE-specific
monoclonal antibody (Fig. 1), similar to our previous findings
obtained from the studies with HCVcc [9,12]. Also, the HCV1b
attachment to DHHs was potently inhibited by heparin and
purified HSPGs (Fig. 2) as well as by heparinase treatment which
removes heparan sulfate (HS) from the cell surface (Fig. 3).
Additionally, HCV attachment could be blocked by 2-, 3-, and 6-
sulfated glucosamines (data not shown). More significantly, the
peptide derived from the apoE receptor-binding domain and the
HSPG-binding peptide from VEGF prevented HCV1b from
binding to DHHs (Fig. 4), suggesting that both apoE on the HCV

envelope and the HSPGs on the cell surface are important for
HCV attachment. The molecular interaction between apoE and
HSPGs was previously suggested by findings obtained from
heparin-pull down assay and mutagenesis analysis of the apoE
receptor-binding domain [12]. In this study, it was further
demonstrated that both apoE-derived peptide and the HSPG￾binding peptide potently blocked apoE and heparin interaction
in vitro (Fig. 5). The suppression of apoE binding to Huh-7 cells by
mAb23 and peptide 6a-P further demonstrates that apoE interacts
with HSPGs on the surface of hepatocytes (Fig. 6). Collectively,
these findings demonstrate that HSPGs on the hepatocyte surface
serve as major receptors for apoE binding, resulting in HCV
attachment to the surface of human hepatocytes.
HSPGs were found to serve as receptors for initial attachment of
many different viruses, including but not limited to herpes simplex
virus type 1 (HSV1) [26], cytomegalovirus [27], adeno-associated
virus [28], human papillomavirus [29], vaccinia virus [30],
respiratory syncytial virus [31], dengue virus [32], filovirus [33],
and hepatitis B [34], C [12], and E viruses [35]. The question
arose how HSPGs act as attachment receptors for so many diverse
viruses. We believe that the tropism of initial attachment of
different viruses to their target cell types is likely determined by
molecular interactions between viral envelope protein and the cell
surface HSPG receptor with distinct structure. HSPG is composed
of a core protein and heparin sulfate glycosaminoglycan (GAGs)
chains, resulting in a large mix of structurally heterogeneous
HSPGs [25]. The heterogeneity of HSPGs is the result of different
core proteins, the length of polysaccharides, and numbers and
positions of sulfation [25,36]. Based on their core proteins, HSPGs
can be divided into three subfamilies: the membrane-spanning
proteoglycans like syndecans (1, 2, 3, and 4), the glycopho￾sphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked proteoglycans such as glypicans (1, 2,
3, 4, 5, and 6), and the extracellular matrix proteoglycans
including agrin and perlecan [36]. The numbers of GAGs
attached to core proteins also vary depending on HSPG core
protein. For instance, syndecan-1 contains three GAG attachment
sites within its ectodomain although GAG may be attached to
these three sites individually or in different combinations among
different cell types [36]. Additionally, sulfation at different
positions (e.g., 2-, 3-, and 6-O-sulfation) adds another complexity
to HSPGs [37,38]. Therefore, the structures of HSPGs synthesized
by different cell types would be highly heterogeneous, resulting in
various HSPG receptors for different viruses. The proof-of￾concept of HSPG structure important for virus attachment came
from an elegant study demonstrating that 3-O-sulfation of specific
glucosamine residues in HS determines specific interaction with
HSV1 gD protein [26]. Additionally, a number of studies found
that HSPG core protein syndecans 1–4 preferentially determine
the susceptibility of cells to initial attachment of different viruses
[39–41]. Future studies are warranted to determine the nature and
structure of the specific HSPG utilized by HCV for its initial
attachment to hepatocytes during virus infection. It is also possible
that the initial HCV attachment mediated by apoE binding to
HSPG is stabilized by the subsequent interactions between viral
envelopment proteins (E1 and E2) and their receptors (e.g., CD81,
Figure 5. Effects of the apoE-derived peptides and the HSPG-binding peptide 6a-P on heparin binding. Heparin-immobilized beads
(Pierce) were pre-equilibrated with PBS and then incubated with 500 ml of Huh-7.5 cell culture medium in the absence or presence of varying
concentrations of the peptide hEP or 6a-P. The mutant peptides hEPm and 6a-Pm were used as controls. After 2 hrs incubation at room temperature,
apoE-bound heparin-immobilized beads were spun down by centrifugation. The supernatant was collected and used for detection of the unbound
apoE. The apoE-bound beads in pellet were washed three times with 1 ml of PBS. The heparin-bound and unbound apoE proteins were measured by
Western blotting using an apoE-specific monoclonal antibody (WuE4).

claudin, occludin, SR-BI, and others). These later interactions may
also contribute to the tropism of HCV infection.
The interaction between protein ligands on the viral envelope
and their HSPG receptors is largely electrostatic. Thus, it is
possible that initial virus attachment mediated by HSPG receptors
may not be highly specific. The specificity of virus attachment to
target cells may also be determined by interactions of viral
envelope protein(s) with other cell surface receptor(s). In the case of
HCV, the binding of apoE on the HCV envelope to the cell
surface HSPG receptor initiates HCV attachment. The subse￾quent interactions between E2 and other cell surface receptors
and/or co-receptors, including CD81, claudin, occludin, and SR￾BI, probably stabilize HCV attachment and therefore result in
specific infection of hepatocytes. This argument is in line with a
recent finding that nonhepatic 293 cells could be infected with
HCV only when they expressed the aforementioned four key
receptors and/or co-receptors [15]. However, the importance and
underlying molecular mechanism of the cell surface receptors in
HCV attachment and entry to cells are not well understood.
HSPGs as virus attachment receptors could serve as potential
antiviral targets. As discussed above, HSV1 attachment to cells
requires 3-O-sulfated glucosamine residues in HSPG [26]. Based
on this knowledge, Hu et al. synthesized two 3-O-sulfonated
heparan sulfate octasaccharides as antiviral compounds [42].
Interestingly, these sulfated sugars potently blocked HSV1
infection in vitro and in mice, demonstrating the feasibility of
HSPGs as antiviral targets. The structural determination of the
specific HSPG receptors used by different viruses will facilitate
rational design of potent antiviral inhibitors which can be
developed as specific drugs to control various virus infections.
