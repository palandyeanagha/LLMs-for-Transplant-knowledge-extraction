Abstract
Background: Altered regulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) composition by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 
and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMPs) may contribute to arterial stiffening. We investigated associations 
between circulating MMP-1, -2, -3, -9, -10 and TIMP-1, and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) and pulse pres‑
sure (PP), as markers of arterial stiffness in type 1 diabetic patients.
Methods: Individuals with type 1 diabetes from three different cohorts were included in this study: EURODIAB Pro‑
spective Complications study (n = 509), LEACE (n = 370) and PROFIL (n = 638). Linear regression analyses were used 
to investigate cross-sectional associations between circulating levels of MMP-1, -2, -3, -9, -10, and TIMP-1 and cfPWV 
(n = 614) as well as office PP (n = 1517). Data on 24-h brachial and 24-h central PP were available in 638 individu‑
als from PROFIL. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, duration of diabetes, HbA1c, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and 
eGFR, and additionally for other cardiovascular risk factors and presence of vascular complications.
Results: After adjustment for potential confounders and presence of vascular complications, circulating MMP-3 
was associated with cfPWV [β per 1 SD higher lnMMP3 0.29 m/s (0.02; 0.55)]. In addition, brachial and central 24-h PP 
measurements in PROFIL were significantly associated with MMP-2 [(1.40 (0.47:2.33) and 1.43 (0.63:2.23)]. Pooled data 
analysis showed significant associations of circulating levels of MMP-1 and MMP-2 with office PP [β per 1 SD higher 
lnMMP-1 and lnMMP-2 = − 0.83 mmHg (95% CI − 1.50; − 0.16) and = 1.33 mmHg (0.55; 2.10), respectively].
Conclusions: MMPs-1, -2, and -3 are independently associated with markers of arterial stiffening in patients with type 
1 diabetes and may become therapeutic targets.

Background
Arterial stiffening is an important pathway through 
which diabetes causes cardiovascular disease [1]. The 
current gold standard to quantify arterial stiffness [2] is 
carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) measure￾ments, which have shown to be significantly higher in 
type 1 diabetic patients with previous CVD compared 
to patients without CVD after multivariable adjustment 
[3]. In addition, previous studies in individuals with type 
1 diabetes have shown independent associations between 
higher pulse pressure (PP), another and older marker 
of arterial stiffness, and incident cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) [4, 5] and all-cause mortality [4].

Although the pathogenic mechanism leading to greater 
arterial stiffness in type 1 diabetes has not been fully 
elucidated, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling, by 
matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitor 
of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), is thought to contribute 
to alterations in vascular collagen and/or elastin content, 
proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle 
cells, and plaque instability, potentially leading to greater 
arterial stiffness, hypertension and subsequent micro￾and macrovascular complications [6–10].
So far, studies reporting on associations between cir￾culating levels of MMPs and TIMP on the one hand and 
arterial stiffness on the other have been inconsistent. 
cfPWV has been positively associated with (pro)MMP-1 
[11–13], MMP-2 [14–16], MMP-9 [14] and TIMP-1 [17], 
whereas null associations between circulating levels of 
MMP-9 [15, 17, 18] and TIMP-1 [15, 18] and cfPWV 
have also been published. Only one study showed a posi￾tive association between MMP-2 and PP [19]. Most stud￾ies were relatively small and addressed only a limited 
number of MMPs, and none focused specifically on indi￾viduals with type 1 diabetes.
Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate asso￾ciations between circulating levels of MMP-1, -2, -3, -9, 
and -10 and of TIMP-1 with markers of arterial stiffness, 
i.e. cfPWV and PP, in individuals with type 1 diabetes.
Methods
Study population
To study possible associations between circulating mark￾ers of ECM remodelling and cfPWV, the current gold 
standard for arterial stiffness, we used the PROFIL study 
[3], which is a cross-sectional study that was conducted 
at the Steno Diabetes Center in Denmark, between 2009 
and 2011, and included 676 individuals with type 1 dia￾betes. In the diabetes group, 316 patients were normoal￾buminuric, 169 had microalbuminuria and 191 had 
macroalbuminuria (by design).
Further evaluation of arterial stiffness in individuals 
with type 1 diabetes, as expressed by PP, was performed 
by combining data from the PROFIL study with data 
from the EURODIAB Prospective Complications Study 
[20–22] and the LEACE study [23]. We added these 
analyses in multiple studies to investigate external valid￾ity and reproducibility, as cfPWV was only present in 1 
study. In brief, the cross-sectional EURODIAB nested 
case–control study, which was performed as follow-up 
from the EURODIAB Prospective Complications Study, 
included 543 individuals with type 1 diabetes. Selected 
cases (n  =  348) were those with one or more vascular 
complications, whereas controls (n  =  195) were those 
without any evidence of vascular complications. The 
LEACE study is a prospective cohort study conducted 
at the Steno Diabetes Center in Denmark, with baseline 
measurements performed in 1993 when 391 individuals 
with type 1 diabetes were included. In this study group, 
199 had diabetic nephropathy and 192 had normoalbu￾minuria (by design).
Individuals with missing data on MMPs or TIMP-1 
(n  =  25), office PP (n  =  15) or potential confounders 
(n = 53) were excluded from the present analyses, result￾ing in a total study population of 1517 individuals (509 
from EURODIAB, 370 from LEACE and 638 from PRO￾FIL). The local Ethics Committees approved the studies 
and all patients gave informed consent.
Main determinants
Concentrations of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP￾9, MMP-10 and TIMP-1 were determined in EDTA 
plasma (for LEACE) or serum samples (for EURODIAB 
and PROFIL) that were stored at − 80 °C until analyses. 
Circulating levels of MMPs and TIMP-1 were measured 
using a commercially available multi-array enzyme￾linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit [Human MMP￾3-Plex Kit (for MMP-1, -3 and -9), Human MMP-2-Plex 
Kit (for MMP-2 and -10) and Human TIMP-1 Kit, MSD, 
Rockville, United States of America] according to the 
manufacturer’s protocol. The MMPs were detected in 
both a pro- and an active form. TIMP-1 was detected 
only in the active form. The intra- and inter-assay coef￾ficients of variation were < 10% for MMP-1, -2, -3, -9, and 
-10 and TIMP-1 in all studies, except for the inter-assay 
coefficient of variation of MMP-1 in PROFIL (10.4%), 
the inter-assay coefficients of variation in all studies for 
MMP-3 (10.8–14.1%) and the inter-assay coefficient of 
variation for MMP-9 in LEACE (13.7%).
Main outcomes
cfPWV and/or PP were studied as markers of arterial 
stiffness. cfPWV measurements were performed in the 
PROFIL study and were available in 614 of the 638 par￾ticipants. Trained laboratory technicians performed 
the measurements with the SphygmoCor device (AtCor 
Medical, Sydney, Australia) in participants in a supine 
position after a resting period of 15  min. Three cfPWV 
measurements were recorded and the two measurements 
closest to each other were averaged and used in the 
analyses.
In the EURODIAB and the LEACE studies, a ran￾dom zero sphygmomanometer (Hawskley, Lancing, UK) 
with the appropriate cuff size was used to measure arte￾rial blood pressure. In the EURODIAB study, measure￾ments were performed in a seated position after resting 
for 5  min [24], whereas in the LEACE study measure￾ments were performed after at least 10  min of rest in 
supine position [25]. In the PROFIL study, brachial 

Peeters et al. Cardiovasc Diabetol (2017) 16:139 Page 3 of 9
blood pressure was determined after resting for 15  min 
in supine position (A&D Medical, Tokyo, Japan) using an 
appropriate cuff size [26]. PP (mmHg) was calculated by 
subtracting diastolic blood pressure from systolic blood 
pressure. Besides PP, in 638 patients from the PROFIL 
study, data on 24-h ambulatory blood pressure meas￾urements (ABPM) were available. A validated tonomet￾ric watch-like device (BPro, HealthStats, Singapore) was 
used to record these 24-h ABPM. This device captured 
radial pulse wave reflections and calculated ABPM [27, 
28]. The device was calibrated to brachial blood pressure 
and calculated central blood pressure. Blood pressure 
was measured every 15 min. ABPM data were considered 
adequate when at least 14 and 7 measurements were per￾formed during the day (07.00 a.m.–11.00 p.m.) and night 
(11.00 p.m.–07.00 a.m.), respectively, according to cur￾rent guidelines [29]. A mean ± SD of 45 ± 7 successful 
measurements were recorded during the day and 18 ± 4 
during the night.
Potential confounders
Demographic data, information about medication, smok￾ing history, duration of diabetes and use of antihypertensive 
medication were collected using questionnaires and patient 
records. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was calculated as 
[systolic blood pressure + (2 ∗ diastolic blood pressure)]/. 3
Body weight and height were measured to calculate the 
body mass index (BMI). Blood samples were taken for 
measurements of total cholesterol, glycated hemoglobin 
(HbA1c) and creatinine. We estimated the glomerular fil￾tration rate (eGFR) using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epi￾demiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation [30].
Vascular complications
Vascular complications were defined as presence of 
macro- and/or microvascular complications, i.e. CVD, 
albuminuria or retinopathy. CVD was defined, in all 
studies, as a cardiovascular event in a patient’s medical 
history, including myocardial infarction, coronary inter￾vention or stroke [3, 23, 31] and this definition is appli￾cable to 96% of CVD in our total study population. In the 
EURODIAB study, angina and ischemic changes on ECG 
were also included in the definition of CVD [31]. In addi￾tion, (intervention for) peripheral arterial disease was 
additionally included in LEACE and PROFIL [3, 23].
Albumin excretion rates were measured in 24-h urine 
collections. Microalbuminuria was defined as albumin 
excretion rate (AER) between 20 and 200  µg/min or 
between 30 and 300  mg/24  h. Macroalbuminuria was 
defined as AER above 200 µg/min or 300 mg/24 h.
Retinopathy was assessed by retinal photography 
in all studies. Individuals were classified as no retin￾opathy, non-proliferative retinopathy, or proliferative 
retinopathy. In the PROFIL study blindness was also clas￾sified. Classification was conducted according to local 
protocols [3, 23, 32].
Statistical analyses
All analyses were performed using the Statistical Package 
for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 20 (IBM Corporation, 
Armonk, NY, USA). Log-transformation was performed 
for variables with a skewed distribution (i.e. MMP-1, 
MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, MMP-10 and TIMP-1).
One-way ANOVA and Chi square tests were performed 
for comparison of baseline characteristics between the 
tertiles of cfPWV and of office PP. Linear regression 
analyses were applied to examine associations between 
circulating levels of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP￾9, MMP-10 and TIMP-1 on the one hand and cfPWV 
(n =  614), office PP (n =  1517), or 24-h PP (n =  638) 
measurements on the other. Analyses of these asso￾ciations were adjusted for age, sex, duration of diabetes, 
HbA1c, eGFR, MAP, cohort and double inclusion (model 
1). One hundred and thirty four patients were included 
in both the LEACE and the PROFIL study. However, 
inclusion in PROFIL was more than 15  years later than 
in LEACE. Therefore we decided to adjust for this instead 
of deleting these cases, which could lead to selection bias. 
The latter two adjustments in model 1 were only per￾formed in case of office PP analysis. Further adjustments 
were made for total cholesterol, BMI, smoking status, use 
of antihypertensive medication and presence of any vas￾cular complication (model 2). Results of these analyses 
are presented as m/s higher cfPWV or mmHg higher PP 
per 1 SD higher level of circulating lnMMP or lnTIMP-1. 
For this purpose, the MMP and TIMP-1 Z-scores were 
calculated cohort-specifically as absolute values may not 
be comparable due to sample preparation (i.e., plasma 
in LEACE vs. serum in EURODIAB and PROFIL). Fur￾thermore, analyses of the associations between MMP-1, 
-2, -3, -9, and -10 and the outcomes were adjusted for 
the MMP inhibitor TIMP-1, as an indication of MMP 
activity.
We additionally tested for interaction by variables that 
may modify the associations between MMPs and TIMP-1 
on the one hand and cfPWV or PP on the other (i.e. sex 
or, in the case of analyses with office PP, cohort) by add￾ing product terms between these variables and MMPs 
and TIMP-1 to the fully adjusted models. We stratified 
our analyses whenever significant interactions (p for 
interaction < 0.05) were found.
Results
Patient characteristics
Table 1 shows patient characteristics according to tertiles 
of cfPWV (n  =  614). Higher cfPWV was significantly 

Peeters et al. Cardiovasc Diabetol (2017) 16:139 Page 4 of 9
associated with higher age, male gender, higher BMI, 
longer duration of diabetes, higher systolic blood pres￾sure, higher mean arterial pressure, higher PP and lower 
eGFR. In addition, higher cfPWV was positively associ￾ated with a higher prevalence of CVD, a higher degree of 
albuminuria and a higher degree of retinopathy. Circulat￾ing levels of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, MMP￾10 and TIMP-1 were also significantly higher with higher 
cfPWV.
Associations between MMPs, TIMP‑1 and cfPWV
Table 2 shows the results of the analyses of the associa￾tions between MMPs, TIMP-1 and cfPWV in 614 par￾ticipants from the PROFIL study. Circulating MMP-3 
levels showed an independent association with cfPWV 
[0.29 m/s (0.02; 0.55)] after full adjustment for potential 
confounders and presence of vascular complications. Cir￾culating levels of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-10 and 
TIMP-1 were not independently associated with cfPWV. 
As both age and duration of diabetes are significantly 
associated, and can thus lead to overadjustment, we 
reanalyzed the data without adjustment for diabetes 
duration. Results showed an independent association 
between MMP-2 and cfPWV, with an increase in cfPWV 
of 0.24 m/s (0.02; 0.46) per 1 SD higher lnMMP-2, after 
adjustment for the other potential confounders and pres￾ence of vascular complications. In addition, the associa￾tion between MMP-3 and cfPWV became stronger in the 
fully adjusted model [0.38 (0.11; 0.46)]. The associations 
between MMP-1, MMP-9, MMP-10, and TIMP-1 with 
cfPWV did not materially change after adjustment for 
age instead of age and diabetes duration.

associated with PP [−  0.83 (−  1.50; −  0.16)], whereas 
MMP-2 was positively associated with PP [1.33 (0.55; 
2.10)] (Table  3, model 2). These associations did not 
materially change after additional adjustment for TIMP-1 
(Table 3, model 3) or mutual adjustment for MMP-2 or 
MMP-1, respectively. MMP-3, MMP-9, MMP-10 and 
TIMP-1 were not independently associated with PP 
(Table 3). MMP-9 was only associated with PP after addi￾tional adjustment for TIMP-1 [− 0.71 (− 1.40; − 0.01)] 
(Table 3, model 3).
As brachial BP measurement may overestimate central 
SBP and PP more in younger individuals, we re-analyzed 
the data in individuals above 40  years of age (n =  974, 
pooled data) as arterial stiffness is higher at a younger age 
compared to non-diabetic individuals. After full adjust￾ment for potential confounders, 1 SD higher MMP-1 was 
inversely associated with PP [−  1.53 (−  2.45; −  0.61)], 
whereas MMP-2 and MMP-3 were positively associated 
with PP [1.40 (0.45; 2.35)] and [1.59 (0.48; 2.70)], respec￾tively. In addition, these three markers of ECM remode￾ling all remained independently associated with office PP 
when included in the analysis with all MMPs and TIMP-1 
together.
In the PROFIL study only, in which data on 24-h bra￾chial and 24-h central PP were available, only MMP-2 
was significantly associated with 24-h brachial PP [1.40 
(0.47; 2.33)] and 24-h central PP [1.43 (0.63; 2.23)] (Addi￾tional file  1: Table S3). MMP-2 remained significantly 
associated with 24-h PP measurement when only indi￾viduals above 40 were analyzed (data not shown).
Additional analyses
Adjustment for CVD, albuminuria and retinopathy as 
separate variables, instead of combined into presence 
of any vascular complication, did not materially change 
the results (data not shown). Adjustment for ACE￾inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor antagonists instead of 
antihypertensive therapy did also not materially change 
the results (data not shown). Additional adjustment, in 
individuals from the PROFIL study, for use of statins 
and heart rate did not materially change the associa￾tions either between MMPs and cfPWV/office PP or 
between MMP-2 and 24-h blood pressure measure￾ments (data not shown).

The association between MMP-1 and PP in LEACE 
differed significantly from those in the other studies (p 
for interaction 0.015). MMP-1 was inversely associated 
with PP in EURODIAB [−  1.41 (−  2.59; −  0.23)] and 
non-significantly inversely in PROFIL [−  0.73 (−  1.64; 
0.19)], whereas a non-significant positive association 
was observed in LEACE [0.20 (− 1.41; 1.81)] (Additional 
file 1: Table S4). No other significant interaction between 
MMPs/TIMP-1 and cohort was present with regard to 
the associations between MMPs, TIMP-1 and PP.
No significant sex-associated differences were observed 
in the associations between MMPs, TIMP-1 and cfPWV 
or PP (p for interaction, all > 0.05).
Discussion
In the present study in individuals with type 1 diabetes, 
we showed that serum levels of MMP-3 were positively 
associated with cfPWV. In addition, circulating levels of 
MMP-1 were inversely, and of MMP-2 positively, associ￾ated with PP. These associations persisted after adjust￾ment for potential confounders. Circulating levels of 
MMP-9, MMP-10, and TIMP-1 did not show associa￾tions with markers of arterial stiffening.
Our study is the first to show an independent asso￾ciation between serum MMP-3 and cfPWV in individu￾als with type 1 diabetes, after (extensive) adjustment for 
potential confounders. To the best of our knowledge, 
only two studies, in patients without type 1 diabetes, have 
investigated circulating MMP-3 levels and markers of 
arterial stiffness [33, 34]. Although none of these studies 
reported independent associations between circulating 
MMP-3 and cfPWV, 1-year treatment with perindopril, 
compared to placebo, was associated with a significant 
reduction in cfPWV as well as in plasma MMP-2 and 
plasma MMP-3 in 17 patients with Marfan Syndrome 
[33]. In addition, Sasamura et al. [34] observed a non-sig￾nificant positive association between circulating MMP-3 
and brachial ankle PWV (baPWV) in a small study of 
non-diabetic hypertensive patients.
MMP-3 may contribute to arterial stiffness by cleav￾ing matrix collagens (type II, IV, IX, X), elastin, laminin 
and nidogen, leading to increased collagen turnover and 
decreased elastin content. MMP-3, similar to MMP-2, 
can also induce fibroblast-mediated matrix production 
by cleaving extracellular decorin and releasing TGF-β 
from the extracellular matrix [35]. In contrast to cfPWV, 
circulating levels of MMP-3 were not associated with 
office PP (pooled data) nor with 24-h PP measurements. 
This could be caused by the fact that MMP-3 mediated 
ECM remodeling might mainly be performed in descend￾ing part of the aorta and that its intrinsic actions in the 
ascending aorta and aortic arch might be limited due the 
difference in aortic tissue composition [36]. This could 
explain the different findings in the associations between 
MMP-3 on the one hand and cfPWV and PP measure￾ments on the other. However, as office PP may overesti￾mate central PP more in younger (healthy) individuals, as 
indicated by Laurent et  al. [2], we showed that MMP-3 
was also associated with office PP in individuals with type 
1 diabetes above the age of 40, which is in line with the 
association between MMP-3 and cfPWV. In addition, 
Rönnback et al. [37] showed that similar PP levels were 
observed 15–20  years earlier in individuals with type 1 
diabetes compared to non-diabetic controls. Moreover, 
in a prospective study in individuals with type 1 diabetes 
with a mean age of 39  years, brachial PP was positively 
associated with incident CVD [5].
Serum MMP-2 levels and cfPWV were not inde￾pendently associated in our study, whereas circulat￾ing MMP-2 was associated with both office PP (pooled 
data) as well as 24-h PP measurements. Our result dif￾fers from studies performed in non-diabetic individuals, 
in whom positive associations between circulating levels 
of MMP-2 and cfPWV were observed [14–16]. However, 
our study is in accordance with the study by Coutinho 
et al. [19], in which a positive association between plasma 
MMP-2 and PP was observed in normotensive and 
hypertensive African-Americans in the GENOA study. 
These results were also supported by studies at tissue 
level [8, 38, 39]. Arteries of dialyzed chronic kidney dis￾ease patients compared to those of non-dialyzed chronic 
kidney disease patients and kidney donors [38] showed 
higher MMP-2 activity, which was associated with lower 
elastic fiber content and greater arterial stiffness. In 
addition, renal transplant recipients with diabetes had 
stiffer arteries compared to recipients without diabetes 
and controls, and this was significantly associated with 
higher MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity in the arterial wall 
[8]. Next, in aortic tissue of aging rats with higher systolic 
blood pressure, higher intimal and medial MMP-2 levels 
and MMP-2/TIMP-2 ratios were observed [39]. These 
increases were accompanied by greater vascular intima 
and media thickness as well as higher medial type III 
collagen and lower elastin content [39]. MMP-2 has the 
ability to release transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) 
from the ECM [35]. A TGF-β-induced increase in fibro￾blast-mediated ECM production thus may be a plausible 
mechanism to explain the strong association between 
MMP-2 and arterial stiffening [40].
Duration of diabetes appeared to be the major con￾founder in the association between MMP-2 and cfPWV 
and was significantly correlated with age. If duration of 
diabetes would not be taken into account, a positive asso￾ciation was in fact observed, which is in line with the 
association between MMP-2 and office PP as well as 24-h 
PP measurements. Therefore, the model with adjustment 

Peeters et al. Cardiovasc Diabetol (2017) 16:139 Page 7 of 9
for both age and diabetes duration may have been over￾adjusted and our results are consistent with an important 
role for MMP-2 in pathophysiological vascular remod￾eling. However, we cannot exclude that both age and 
duration of diabetes were the major confounders in the 
association between MMP-2 and cfPWV.
We also showed that serum MMP-1 was border￾line significantly inversely associated with cfPWV after 
adjustment for potential confounders and TIMP-1 lev￾els and this is in contrast to two studies in non-diabetic 
hypertensive patients in whom (pro)MMP-1 was sig￾nificantly and positively associated with cfPWV [11, 
12]. Patients with diabetes were excluded in both stud￾ies and this may explain the different results. However, 
the inverse association between MMP-1 and cfPWV is 
in fact consistent with the inverse association between 
MMP-1 and PP (pooled data) that we observed. The dif￾ference in the associations between MMP-1 on the one 
hand and cfPWV and PP on the other might be caused 
by the differences in vascular wall content in the various 
parts of the aorta [36]. Circulating levels of MMP-1 were 
inversely associated with PP. To our knowledge, correla￾tions between circulating (pro)MMP-1 and PP have only 
been published in studies that did not include individuals 
with type 1 diabetes [12, 41], and were not adjusted for 
potential confounders. In our crude analysis, 1SD higher 
lnMMP-1 was associated with a higher PP [1.36 (0.49; 
2.23)]. However the association inverted after adjust￾ment for potential confounders, with MAP being the 
most influential confounder. The fact that higher tissue 
MMP-1 levels have been associated with thoracic aortic 
aneurysm and thoracic aortic dissection [42] also indi￾cates that higher MMP-1 levels may result in decreased 
thoracic aortic collagen content and/or concentration 
leading to decreased arterial stiffness. Nonetheless, evi￾dence so far on the role of MMP-1 in collagen degrada￾tion and/or turnover and arterial stiffness is scarce and 
should be further investigated.
Published data on MMP-9 and PWV are contradic￾tory. The lack of association between MMP-9 and cfPWV 
in the present study was in agreement with studies in 
patients with essential hypertension [17], coronary heart 
disease [18] and bicuspid aortic valves [15]. In contrast, 
Yasmin et  al. [14] observed a positive and independent 
association between MMP-9 and cfPWV in both hyper￾tensive patients and healthy individuals. In addition, 
serum MMP-9, but also MMP-3 and TIMP-1, was corre￾lated with invasive aortic PWV measurements in patients 
with aortic stenosis [43]. However, the latter correla￾tions were unadjusted for potential confounders. In con￾trast to all previous studies, an inverse association was 
observed serum MMP-9 and cfPWV in healthy subjects 
[44]. In accordance with our result, Coutinho et  al. did 
also not observe an association between MMP-9, as well 
as TIMP-1, and PP [19]. Therefore, the role of MMP-9 in 
arterial stiffness remains unclear and warrants further 
investigation.
Our finding of a lack of association between TIMP-1 
levels and cfPWV is supported by various other studies 
[15, 18, 34]. Only the study by Tan et  al. [17] observed 
an independent association between TIMP-1 and cfPWV 
in hypertensive patients, but patients with macrovascular 
complications, diabetes and possible inflammatory dis￾eases were excluded from this study.
Various studies investigated associations between cir￾culating MMP-1 [45], MMP-2 [46, 47], MMP-3 [45], 
MMP-9 [46–49]. MMP-10 [45], and TIMP-1 [46] with 
other markers of arterial stiffness in both type 1 [48] and 
type 2 [45–47, 49] diabetic individuals, but did not find 
significant associations.
Limitations
Several limitations are applicable to our study. First, 
we used PP as marker of arterial stiffness, but this only 
presents indirect information on arterial stiffness and 
it was measured under different circumstances in the 
three different studies. However, it has been shown to be 
an independent predictor of cardiovascular events and 
all-cause mortality in type 1 diabetic patients [1, 4, 5]. 
Second, although our study also included cfPWV meas￾urements, the current gold standard for arterial stiffness, 
these were only available in one of the three included 
studies. Thirdly, we used circulating levels of MMPs and 
TIMP-1, because these can easily be obtained, but we 
do not know whether or not plasma levels truly reflect 
tissue levels or if they originate from one or more spe￾cific tissues. Finally, we cannot draw conclusions on the 
pathophysiological mechanism regarding the develop￾ment of arterial stiffness, because of the cross-sectional 
design of our studies. In addition, the significant differ￾ence, between the LEACE and the other two studies, in 
the association between MMP-1 and PP may have been 
caused by the play of chance. Despite these limitations, 
our results showed largely consistent results throughout 
the three different studies with regard to the associations 
between MMP-1, MMP-2 and PP in individuals with type 
1 diabetes.
Conclusions
In individuals with type 1 diabetes, MMP-1 (inversely) 
and MMP-2 and -3 (both positively) were associated 
with markers of arterial stiffening (PP and cfPWV). The 
results suggest that better understanding of altered ECM 
remodeling in patients with type 1 diabetes could pro￾vide a potential therapeutic target, which could lead to 
decreased arterial stiffness and improved outcomes.
