Introduction
Preclinical models are essential to address knowledge gaps in three of the most vexing and serious lung 
transplantation complications: primary graft dysfunction (PGD), acute rejection (AR), and chronic lung 
allograft dysfunction (CLAD). Each one of these complications significantly curtails lung allograft and 
patient survival, and cannot be addressed by patient-based research alone. While preclinical models for 
these lung complications have been developed, the usefulness and robustness of these models needs to be 
better clarified. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the NIH convened a work￾shop to review the current state of preclinical models of PGD, AR, and CLAD and to provide consensus 
Lung transplantation, a cure for a number of end-stage lung diseases, continues to have the worst 
long-term outcomes when compared with other solid organ transplants. Preclinical modeling of the 
most common and serious lung transplantation complications are essential to better understand 
and mitigate the pathophysiological processes that lead to these complications. Various animal 
and in vitro models of lung transplant complications now exist and each of these models has 
unique strengths. However, significant issues, such as the required technical expertise as well 
as the robustness and clinical usefulness of these models, remain to be overcome or clarified. 
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) convened a workshop in March 2016 to 
review the state of preclinical science addressing the three most important complications of lung 
transplantation: primary graft dysfunction (PGD), acute rejection (AR), and chronic lung allograft 
dysfunction (CLAD). In addition, the participants of the workshop were tasked to make consensus 
recommendations on the best use of these complimentary models to close our knowledge gaps 
in PGD, AR, and CLAD. Their reviews and recommendations are summarized in this report. 
Furthermore, the participants outlined opportunities to collaborate and directions to accelerate 
research using these preclinical models.

recommendations to the broader research community on how to use and improve these models to facili￾tate research efforts in lung transplant research and to improve patients’ outcomes. A summary of the 
models discussed in this workshop report is represented in Figure 1.
PGD
PGD is a spectrum of acute lung allograft injuries that range from a mild capillary leak in alveoli to severe 
diffuse alveolar damage occurring within the first 72 hours after lung transplantation (1). PGD is charac￾terized by radiographic evidence of pulmonary edema with or without infiltrates and consolidation with 
progressive hypoxemia without other identifiable causes. PGD is a form of the acute respiratory distress 
syndrome that has previously been described by several terms including ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), 
reimplantation response, reperfusion edema, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, early graft dysfunction, 
primary graft failure, and posttransplant acute respiratory distress syndrome (1). Numerous PGD models 
can be used to explore different aspects of the lung transplant’s unique pathobiology. The advantages and 
disadvantages of these models are described below and summarized in Table 1.
In vitro modeling of PGD. In vitro modeling of IRI involves exposure of relevant pulmonary cells in 
cultures (or cocultures) to acute hypoxia followed by reoxygenation (2) or using stop-flow methods to test 
effects of endothelial shear stress during IRI (3). Further modifications of the hypoxia/reoxygenation mod￾el may include the use of 4°C preservation solution (e.g., Perfadex) before allowing the cells to warm to 
room temperature followed by reoxygenation in 37°C culture media (4, 5). In vitro models have demon￾strated that longer cold aerobic times enhance apoptosis, cytoskeletal remodeling, permeability, as well as 
upregulation of innate and adaptive immune pathways (2, 6–12). In vitro systems are an economical way to 
decipher cellular responses to certain conditions that follow lung transplant (13–15); however, these models 
must be complemented by in vivo models of IRI.
In vivo modeling of PGD. The IRI component of PGD can be modeled in vivo using multiple well-accept￾ed approaches in animals. The easiest approach involves unilateral hilar occlusion followed by reperfusion, 
and the more technically challenging models involve orthotopic lung transplantation. The well-characterized 
hilar clamp rodent model (16, 17) involves mechanical ventilation, a thoracotomy to expose the left lung 
hilum, and occlusion of all hilar structures with a microvascular clamp or lasso versus selective occlusion of 
the pulmonary artery for a variable period of warm ischemia (18, 19), followed by unclamping allowing for 
reperfusion (20, 21). Sham-operated controls go through a similar procedure to expose the hilum without 
occlusion. This model requires attention to the mechanical ventilation aspect, as this may lead to ventilation￾induced lung injury that can add to the IRI (22, 23). However, using the combination of ventilation-induced 
injury and IRI may parallel what can occur during human lung transplantation (21, 24, 25).
Another variation of the hilar clamp model involves isolating and clamping the pulmonary artery 
alone to preserve gas exchange, and is referred to as the nonhypoxic lung ischemia model (19). Addition￾ally, IRI has been studied using isolated, perfused rodent lung models in which the lungs are manipulated 
either ex vivo or in situ, and continuously perfused with synthetic media and ventilated in a temperature￾controlled chamber (19, 26). The orthotopic, single-lung transplant model has also been used to model 
PGD. In this approach, the cold ischemic time of the donor lung is intentionally prolonged (up to 18 
hours) to produce lung injury upon reperfusion (27, 28). It can also be performed as an allograft, allowing 
a unique ability to assess the effects of varying periods of cold ischemia on subsequent development of 
PGD, as well as the contributions of early antigen-independent events to the subsequent development of 
AR and potentially later chronic injury.
Key endpoints used in these models include lung edema and permeability using the gravimetric (wet/
dry) ratio (20, 27, 29), the translocation of exogenously administered Evan’s blue dye or radiolabeled or 
fluorescently labeled proteins, or by measuring the accumulation of endogenous proteins (total protein, 
albumin, IgM) in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (20, 21, 27). Testing for cardiopulmonary hemodynam￾ics, lung function, and oxygenation using indwelling devices, surface probes, and arterial blood gases can 
also be performed (20, 21, 27). These IRI models involve lung oxidative stress with lipid peroxidation (30) 
and have been associated with reduced arterial oxygenation (6), reduced compliance, increased airway 
resistance, and high pulmonary artery pressures (31, 32). Lungs also develop increased pulmonary vas￾cular fibrin deposition and elevated expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) (6). Further￾more, there is a robust extravasation and recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells into the lung 
(20), increased levels of high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) (7), myeloperoxidase (a marker of

Figure 1. A summary of preclinical models used for lung transplant research. There are a number of preclinical models (right) to study the three major 
complications of lung transplantation (left): (i) Primary graft dysfunction (PGD), which occurs as a consequence of organ procurement, cold storage and 
implantation; (ii) acute rejection (AR), which is mediated through cell- and antibody-mediated immune responses; and (iii) chronic rejection or CLAD, 
which pathologically manifests as RAS and OB. PGD can be modeled through in vitro culture systems to assess cellular responses to cold hypoxia and 
warm reperfusion. Ischemia-reperfusion injury associated with PGD can be modeled by the hilar clamp model in vivo. Limiting PGD and prolonging 
transplant survival can be studied through the use of ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) in animal models. Orthotopic lung transplantation in animal models 
is a highly rigorous approach that can be used to study PGD as well as AR, immune tolerance, lymphatic biology, obliterative bronchiolitis (OB), and 
restrictive allograft syndrome (RAS). Heterotopic and intrapulmonary tracheal transplant models are high-throughput procedures useful for modeling 
AR processes. Orthotopic tracheal transplantation models large airway changes in acute and chronic rejection and is especially useful for studying 
microvascular changes. The graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) model, which relies on bone marrow transplantation of MHC-mismatched cells, produces 
OB-like lesions. Illustrated by Rachel Davidowitz.

neutrophil/mononuclear phagocyte activation and infiltration) (30), and proinflammatory cytokines and 
chemokines (7, 8, 15, 20, 24), all exemplifying multiple complex inflammatory pathways involved in PGD.
An advantage of the hilar clamp model for studying the IRI component of PGD is that it is less techni￾cally demanding than the orthotopic single-lung transplant models (33) and, as such, is a suitable platform 
for testing therapeutic delivery, rehabilitative potential, and biomarkers predictive of PGD. Orthotopic lung 
transplantation is a more technically demanding model that may be more informative for issues relevant to 
surgical implantation and innate immunity. Significant interest has been generated in allograft optimization 
through ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP). Most studies involving EVLP have utilized human lungs (34, 35) or 
large animal (mainly porcine) models (36–39) with or without transplantation. Nonetheless, rodent studies 
using EVLP and lung transplantation have been performed (40–42). A recent study introduced a murine 
model of EVLP and demonstrated that Steen solution improved lung function as compared with cold 
static–preserved lungs (43). The addition of adenosine receptor agonist/antagonist in the Steen solution 
augmented lung function while reducing proinflammatory cytokines, deleterious innate immunity path￾ways, and neutrophil vascular margination (43, 44). Similar results have been shown in larger animals and 
human lungs using similar systems (45). Moreover, the delivery of IL-10 by EVLP adenoviral gene therapy 
to injured human donor lungs (46) resulted in improved lung function in pigs receiving therapy (47). These 
studies demonstrate that animal models provide a reproducible and effective means for experimental and 
mechanistic studies of EVLP. Combined with transplantation, these models could rapidly advance the 
potential of EVLP in rehabilitating marginal donor lungs for successful transplantation.
Imaging in animal models of PGD. Transplantation results in a highly predictable period of immune 
activation associated with the implantation of a solid organ expressing foreign antigens. Methods to image 
mobilization and activation of the immune system during this period are currently limited, but emerg￾ing technologies may provide new opportunities to study this period. With the emergence of molecular 
imaging, new sensitive and selective imaging probes have been developed that can be translated from ani￾mal models to patients. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission 
tomography (PET) imaging can detect and monitor a variety of pathophysiological processes such as T cell 
activity by glucose uptake and neutrophil activation by binding of the peptide cinnamoyl-F-(D)L-F-(D)L-F 
(cFLFLF) to the formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) (48–50). Multiphoton intravital microscopy can also 
be used to assess specific cell populations and functions during murine IRI (51–53). These studies provide 
encouraging results to elucidate underlying pathways or monitor for PGD.
AR
The two major forms of AR are acute cellular rejection (ACR) and antibody-mediated rejection (AMR). 
ACR is well characterized and is classified into two subtypes: type A is a lymphocytic inflammatory cel￾lular infiltrate that ranges from a mild perivascular infiltrate with no obvious tissue injury, to infiltrates that 
also involve the interstitium and air-spaces with prominent acute lung injury with vasculitis; type B airway 
inflammation, namely lymphocytic bronchitis, is currently classified as either low-grade, with no tissue 
injury, or high-grade, in which there is a more extensive infiltrate associated with injury to the airway (54). 
Both A and B types of ACR are thought to increase the risk of development of bronchiolitis obliterans 
syndrome (BOS). The other form of AR, AMR, is not as well characterized but has been described as 
including C4d deposition in capillaries, neutrophilic capillaritis, intravascular macrophages, and acute lung 
injury (55, 56). Preclinical models have been useful for exploring mechanisms of both ACR and AMR

(summarized in Table 2). Understanding the pathophysiology and limiting the extent of injury of AR is an 
important need in the lung transplant field.
Modeling lung transplantation AR in mice and rats. Since the 1960s, experiments using canine and rat ortho￾topic lung transplant models have examined various aspects of AR. For example, in the rat model, the onset 
of AR was more rapid in lungs when compared with heart grafts (57). The most commonly used mouse 
model to study lung rejection in the 1990s and early 2000s was heterotopic tracheal transplantation (HTT) 
(58). In this model, rejecting allografts demonstrate early inflammation, epithelial necrosis, and fibroprolif￾eration in the airway lumen, which were not observed in the isografts. While the histological changes make 
this model especially valuable for studying chronic rejection observed in the airways of human lungs (as 
described below), it has also been useful as a high-throughput model for studying the cellular requirements 
for rejection (59). Later, the orthotopic tracheal transplantation (OTT) model was developed that conferred 
the added advantage of being a functional transplant in its native position. This model has provided useful 
insights about early events in AR (e.g., see ref. 60) and has been developed as an especially useful model 
for studying microvascular changes that occur in AR, as described in detail below. The intrapulmonary 
tracheal transplant model as a model of AR has been useful to show the importance of intrapulmonary de 
novo lymphoid tissue (61). In 2007, the mouse orthotopic lung transplant model was introduced (33), and 
while highly technically challenging, the histological changes observed as early as three days after transplan￾tation in major histocompatibility complex–mismatched (MHC-mismatched) strain combinations closely 
resembled perivascular and peribronchial mononuclear infiltrates seen on transbronchial biopsies of lung 
transplant patients suffering from AR.
With the aid of genetic tools available in mice and novel imaging approaches, the mouse orthotopic 
lung transplant model has yielded some fresh insights into mechanisms of acute lung allograft rejection. 
For example, recipient T cells rapidly infiltrate lung allografts where they interact with donor dendritic 
cells (62). In fact, the lung graft provides a suitable environment for the priming of alloreactive T cells, 
and lungs can be rejected in the absence of secondary lymphoid organs (62), in contrast to other solid￾organ grafts such as hearts. Unlike the case for hearts, AR of lungs is not dependent on CD4+ T cells 
(63). Furthermore, interaction between innate and adaptive immune cells within pulmonary grafts can 
trigger AR. To this end, neutrophilic graft infiltration, a hallmark of PGD, can trigger IL-12 production by 
dendritic cells that skews the T cell response towards Th1 (53). Orthotopically transplanted mouse lungs 
are exposed to the environment, allowing for the design of experiments to evaluate the role of respiratory 
pathogens on alloimmunity and AR responses. Pseudomonas aeruginosa respiratory infections can break 
immunosuppression-mediated lung allograft tolerance (64). This model is a suitable platform to evaluate 
new diagnostic modalities for AR. For example, fluorodeoxyglucose PET (FDG-PET) can be used to 
monitor acute lung allograft rejection owing to a high rate of metabolism of graft-infiltrating T cells (65). 
Thus, the orthotopic mouse lung transplant model is an effective experimental platform to study mecha￾nisms that contribute to AR, test noninvasive diagnostic modalities as well as to study immune tolerance 
(66), and evaluate strategies to prevent or treat this complication.

AMR. Elicitation of immune responses to the mismatched donor human leukocyte antigen (HLA) 
and breakdown of tolerance to tissue-restricted self-antigens pose a significant challenge to acceptance and 
continued graft function following organ transplantation (67, 68). While the mechanisms of AMR are not 
firmly established, de novo donor-specific antibodies against HLA have been shown to predispose to the 
development of immune responses to lung self-antigens and BOS (69–71). To define mechanisms leading to 
anti-MHC–mediated development of rejection, a preclinical murine model was developed in which exog￾enous anti-MHC was administered into the native lungs and elicited production of antibodies and T cell 
responses specific for lung-associated self-antigens, type V collagen [col(V)], and K-α 1 tubulin, culminating 
in fibrotic pathology (72, 73). Human lung transplant recipients develop antibodies against col(V), a protein 
mainly located in the lung interstitium and not ordinarily exposed to the immune system. In the rat lung 
transplant model, allografts in minor histocompatibility complex–mismatched recipients induce col(V)-
specific T and B immunity after transplantation and appear to be an important source of autoantigen that 
autoantibodies ligate (74). Better understanding of the exact roles of allo- and autoantibodies in AR, like 
chronic rejection, will clearly benefit from improved modeling and biomarkers that delineate disease phe￾notypes and also incorporate orthotopic lung transplant mouse models.
Microvascular injury and large airway disease. The Papworth Autopsy Study evaluated patients who died 
with BOS and correlated the development of chronic rejection with a dropout of airway microvessels (75); 
such a relationship between microvascular destruction during AR and subsequent chronic rejection has been 
suggested with all solid-organ transplants. The OTT model is useful for the study of airway microvessels 
because the tracheal vasculature can be easily visualized in one tissue plane (76). The model is performed 
through an interposition transplant in which the recipient trachea is transected and a donor trachea is sewn 
into the space created by the naturally retracted airway; alternatively, the donor trachea can be sewn in paral￾lel to the native airway (60). During AR, this model has revealed that the airways undergo a transient loss of 
a functional microcirculation accompanied by localized tissue hypoxia and ischemia (77); although a func￾tional microcirculation returns, these grafts cannot be rescued with immunosuppression once the vascular 
bed is transiently lost, suggesting an anatomic basis for the development of chronic rejection. The OTT mod￾el can incorporate fiberoptic bioprobes that detect tissue oxygenation and perfusion over time (76). Another 
facet of a compromised circulation occurs at the time of transplantation in the airway anastomosis that does 
not include a restored bronchial circulation and is susceptible to dehiscence and infection (78). The relative 
ischemia of the airway anastomosis is associated with a proclivity to infection, especially with Aspergillus and 
Pseudomonas. The OTT model appears to be a useful model for this process (79, 80).
Tracheal allografts are proving an exciting, but currently controversial (81), platform to test tissue bio￾engineering concepts in the clinic, as these transplants can be decellularized and repopulated with recipi￾ent-derived cells prior to surgical implantation, an approach that should prevent AR and limit the need for 
chronic immunosuppression (82). A more limited repopulation of donor-derived cells can be observed in

vivo using the mouse OTT model. This line of study may have value in determining how both destructive 
and reparative processes occur through the migration of cell populations from the recipient to the donor 
(77, 80, 83). OTT also facilitates lineage fate mapping studies to track the movement and transformation of 
various cell types in the allograft recipient (83–85). The mouse orthotopic lung transplant model also holds 
promise as an effective platform for evaluating the relative contribution of recipient cells in both the disease 
and repair of small airways and pulmonary parenchyma.
Lymphatic contribution to AR. In the normal lung, there is a highly complex network of lymphatics 
consisting of subpleural lymphatics largely over the lower lobes, and a deeper lymphatic network running 
along the major airways and the blood vasculature in the interstitial spaces. The visceral pleura and the 
neighboring lung tissue are drained through the superficial network into the hilar area of the lung where 
they connect with the deeper plexus of lymphatics (86). At the time of transplant, the bronchus, bronchial 
artery, pulmonary artery, and vein as well as the lymphatics are severed at the level of the hilum. However, 
only the bronchus, pulmonary artery, and vein are reanastomosed. A recent clinical study has revealed that, 
unlike chronic organ failure in kidney transplantation, lymphangiogenesis is not altered in CLAD patients 
(87), which raises questions about the role of altered lymphatics in lung transplantation. Using lymphoscin￾tigraphy, the fate of the lymphatic vasculature after transplantation has been investigated in a canine lung 
transplant model. These studies have shown that functional lymphatic drainage is restored at seven days 
after transplantation in isografts. In allografts treated with immunosuppression, a functional lymphatic bed 
is observed between two and four weeks after transplantation (88). Lymphatic biology can also be effec￾tively studied in the mouse orthotopic lung transplantation model, which revealed a marked decline in the 
density of lymphatic vessels, accompanied by accumulation of low-MW hyaluronan in mouse orthotopic 
allografts undergoing AR (89). Work in this model has suggested a protective role for the promotion of 
lymphangiogenesis in the posttransplant period. The role of the lymphatic vessels and their contribution to 
acute and chronic rejection in lung transplants are poorly understood and deserves greater study.
CLAD
A high rate of chronic graft failure continues to be the most significant hurdle in improving long-term 
survival after lung transplant. In the 1980s, obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) was identified as a common 
pathology in chronically failing lung transplants; OB was subsequently discovered to also be a complication 
of bone marrow transplant recipients (90). Histologic features of lung transplant–associated OB include 
anatomic restriction to membranous and respiratory bronchioles, presence of both constrictive and prolif￾erative subtypes, and potential association with mononuclear cell infiltration (91). Graft vasculopathy with 
progressive myointimal thickening of the pulmonary arteries and veins is also described in association with 
OB. Clinically, OB presents as a progressive obstructive decline in lung function termed BOS. BOS has a 
very high prevalence in the lung transplant population with approximately 50% of patients demonstrating 
this syndrome by five years after transplant. Clinical studies demonstrate a strong link between AR, specifi￾cally airway involvement with lymphocytic bronchitis, and BOS. Other complications in the posttransplant 
period such as PGD and infections have also been linked to BOS.
While BOS remains the predominant cause of CLAD, more recently a restrictive allograft syndrome 
(RAS) has been described. Patients presenting with RAS have been demonstrated to exhibit distinct histologic 
phenotypes such as pleural and subpleural fibrotic changes, intra-alveolar fibrinous exudate, and acute fibrin￾ous (and organizing) pneumonia (92). Most animal models to date have modeled OB and were the primary 
focus of the Workshop and this consensus statement. However, a recent model has been developed utilizing ful￾ly MHC-mismatched orthotopic lung transplants treated with chronic immunosuppression and evaluated ten 
weeks after transplant; these mice develop some features of RAS and offer promise as a new model of chronic 
rejection (93). It may be that a closer evaluation of the orthotopic lung transplant models will reveal features of 
RAS such as subpleural and interstitial fibrosis not previously appreciated (e.g., see ref. 94). We summarize the 
advantages and disadvantages of various preclinical models of chronic rejection below and in Table 3.
Modeling OB. While in vitro models of OB have utility in showing how individual populations, such 
as bronchial epithelial cells, mesenchymal stromal cells, and airway smooth muscle cells, may contrib￾ute to disease (95–98), animal models can provide a window into the events from transplant to the final 
fibrotic obliteration of small airways and is key to investigating the pathogenesis of OB and conducting 
preclinical studies of potential therapeutic interventions. Utilized models of post-lung-transplant OB are 
based on allogeneic lung tissue transplantation with a goal of reproducing fibrotic airway remodeling.

Technically, these models are similar to those utilized for studying AR and include HTT and OTT as well 
as orthotopic single-lung transplantation.
Tracheal transplant models of chronic rejection. Initial discoveries in posttransplantation OB have been 
fueled primarily by the HTT model in which a harvested donor trachea is transplanted into a subcutane￾ous pouch in the dorsal surface of the neck or omentum. Following the IRI and AR phases of injury, these 
transplants undergo a fibroproliferative phase with partial denuding of the epithelium at day 14 and fibro￾obliteration of the allograft trachea at day 21 (24, 99, 100). Conversely, the isografts have a healing airway 
graft at day seven with remnants of epithelial cell hyperplasia; however, this is followed by essentially nor￾mal isografts by days 14 and 21 (24, 99, 100). This model has been utilized in both rats and mice, although 
more consistent fibrosis is noted in rat versus mouse tracheas.
HTT offers a reproducible model to study alloantigen-associated fibrosis in an airway. Airway luminal 
obliteration can be quantified morphometrically and at various time points. Fibrosis can be evaluated by 
staining with trichrome or by smooth muscle actin staining of myofibroblasts. Multiple tracheas can be com￾bined to measure soluble collagen quantitatively by hydroxyproline assay. The small tracheal segments make 
evaluation of cellular components and protein isolation challenging. However, careful single-cell digestion 
allows for evaluation of cellular composition by flow cytometry, and investigators usually combine two or 
more tracheal grafts for protein isolation. The ability to dissect a trachea in its entirety allows for evaluation 
of microvasculature and lymphatics, providing an avenue to study their role in OB development.
The major criticism of the tracheal transplantation model is that fibrotic obliteration is being mod￾eled in a large cartilaginous airway that is histologically distinct from the small airways that are the site of 
human OB (101). Its relevance is also somewhat limited by the absence of a normal air interface and native 
mediastinal lymphatic drainage. Most importantly, human OB develops in a complex in vivo environment 
with distinct cellular niches that cannot be reproduced in a tracheal transplant placed in an extrapulmo￾nary environment. Thus, the HTT model is useful as a high-throughput screen for alloimmunity-induced 
fibrosis, but findings obtained with this procedure must be considered with the appropriate caveat that its 
non-native positioning may affect results.
In the OTT model, epithelial regeneration from migration of recipient-derived epithelial cells limits 
the development of fibrotic occlusion or OB (102). Although obliterative lesions are not observed, OTTs 
develop lymphocytic bronchitis (a large airway precursor of BOS) as well as subepithelial fibrosis (103). 
Findings from the OTT studies have been cautiously extrapolated to explain how occlusive fibrosis may 
evolve following rejection in higher generation bronchioles (77, 80, 83, 104, 105).
Attempts to simulate airway fibrosis in the in vivo lung environment have also been made by placing 
the tracheal graft in the lung tissue through a transthoracic approach termed the intrapulmonary tracheal 
transplant model (61, 106, 107). Another potentially powerful model takes advantage of humanized mice by 
transplanting human airways and peripheral blood mononuclear cells into an immunodeficient mouse (108, 
109). These models are promising for studying peripherally derived human leukocytes but have challenges 
due to the limited supply of human bronchi available.
Orthotopic lung transplant models of chronic rejection. As noted above, a significant step forward in animal 
modeling to understand posttransplant complications has come with establishment of surgical methods for sin￾gle-lung transplant surgery in small animals. However, while rat lung transplantation has been successfully uti￾lized extensively to investigate early complication such as AR, use of rat lung transplant to study chronic graft 
failure has been limited by a failure to establish a robust, reproducible model of OB. Transplantation across 
minor histocompatibility complex–mismatched combination (Fischer 344→Lewis [F344→LEW]) and across 
MHC mismatch (Brown Norway [BN]→LEW) in combination with pharmacologic immunosuppression has 
been shown to recapitulate some aspects of OB pathology in allografts (110). There is some disagreement in 
the transplant community about how closely OB-like lesions generated in orthotopic lung transplants recapitu￾late the human lesion, and there is agreement that appropriate caveats should be made when presenting data 
from these models. Other donor-recipient combinations, such as F344→Wistar Kyoto (WKY), have also been 
demonstrated to develop OB-like lesions at late time points of two to three months after transplantation (111). 
However, there appears to be a difference in animals obtained from different vendors as well as concerns of 
reproducibility across centers (77). Thus, at present, a consensus on a definitive rat lung transplant model to 
study OB pathogenesis has not emerged. An intriguing model of lung transplantation in ferrets also develops 
OB-like lesions (112). Finally, the role of innate immune activation in augmenting OB has also been evaluated 
using the rat lung transplant model with intratracheal gastric fluid challenge (113).

REVIEW
The advancement of surgical techniques to accomplish single-lung transplantation in mice has permit￾ted access to resources such as transgenic mice that can facilitate cellular tracking and pathway targeting 
(33, 114, 115). However, while the AR model was again easily established by using MHC-mismatched 
mice, developing a robust model of OB has been more challenging. Strains that are disparate at MHC 
antigen loci (H-2d
→H-2b
; BALB/c→C57BL/6) develop severe AR by seven days after transplantation, and 
this nearly complete destruction of the lung prevents longer time-point evaluation for development of OB 
(116). This issue was circumvented by Fan et al. (117, 118), and a transplant involving minor histocompat￾ibility complex mismatch (C57BL/10→C57BL/6) developed only mild rejection within one week. Grafts 
could be followed for longer time points, and peribronchial and intraluminal fibrotic lesions were described 
at days 21 and 28 (117). However, these airway fibrotic lesions were noted in only 50% of the transplanted 
mice and were limited to a small number of airways in the allografts. Use of immunosuppression (cyclo￾sporine + steroids) to prolong graft life in MHC mismatch (BALB/c→C57BL/6) has also allowed for 
investigation of the development of OB pathology (119). This model only generates OB-like lesions in 
25%–50% of the mice, with many mice demonstrating no evidence of OB or regaining normal histology 
after 12 weeks. The difference was related to variability in immunosuppression achieved with lower cyclo￾sporine levels noted in mice that developed OB. Taken together, these studies suggest that a moderate mis￾match with continued but contained allo-insult is crucial to development of chronic fibrotic airway lesions.
More recently, investigators at the University of Michigan examined transplant of an F1 to a par￾ent mouse to obtain moderate MHC mismatching that was less antigenically disparate (120). A similar 
strategy has been previously employed in the field of bone marrow transplantation to study chronic graft￾versus-host disease (GVHD) with injection of parental cells into F1 recipients or complete MHC mismatch 
(121–126). These studies demonstrate how the interplay between local innate immunity and alloreactive T 
cell subsets and alloantibody deposition contribute to chronic pulmonary GVHD with fibrotic (including 
OB-like) pathology. The specific combination of transplantation of B6D2F1/J (cross between C57BL/6J 
and H-2-b/d) lungs into DBA/2J (H-2-d
) recipients results in consistent OB-like pathology with peribron￾chial and perivascular fibrosis by day 28 (120). These grafts, which are discordant at the class I allele 
(H-2Db
) with the recipient, demonstrate an evolution from immune cell infiltration to epithelial cell injury 
and development of fibrosis over time that is reminiscent of human disease. The B6D2F1/J→DBA/2J 
transplant model also had very high penetrance, with 100% of allografts exhibiting fibrotic remodeling in 
the majority of airways, allowing it to be utilized for investigation of therapeutic targets (127). However, 
using this combination lends itself to the disadvantage that transgenic mice are not readily available on 
B6D2F1/J and DBA/2J genetic backgrounds.
Fibrotic remodeling of the allograft is the predominant cause of CLAD; hence, a relevant animal model 
for investigating CLAD must recapitulate allograft fibrogenesis and allow for meaningful targeting of spe￾cific pathways. As a primary effector cell of fibrogenesis, mesenchymal cells play a key role in CLAD arising 
from OB or parenchymal fibrosis. While mesenchymal cells orchestrating fibrosis can potentially be derived 
from various sources, the mesenchymal population in the transplanted lung retains its donor origin and these 
graft-derived cells appear to be the predominant contributors to OB lesions (98, 128–131). Investigation of 
fibrotic lesions in the HTT model have shown them to be derived from the recipients (132). Utilizing the 
expression of H-2Db
 to differentiate donor versus recipient origin of the mesenchymal cell population in 
lung allografts, approximately 90% of collagen I–expressing cells in the B6D2F1/J→DBA/2J orthotopic 
model were of donor origin (120). These investigations suggest that the whole-lung transplant model holds 
an advantage over tracheal transplantation in studies of mesenchymal cell recruitment and activation, as it is 
more reflective of mesenchymal populations involved in pathogenesis of OB in human lungs.
Conclusion and recommendations
This NHLBI Workshop report on models of lung transplantation provides an overview of the preclinical 
strategies for researching the major complications involved in this procedure including PGD, AR, and 
CLAD. There is significant opportunity for advancing the field through effective collaboration between 
investigators utilizing different experimental approaches. Cancer is a major complication of lung transplan￾tation that is not adequately addressed by current animal models and deserves greater consideration. The 
NHLBI Workshop consensus recommendations, which were organized around three major complications 
(PGD, AR, and CLAD), are intended only to provide general guidance in the choice of animal models and 
collaborative possibilities and are as follows.

REVIEW
PGD research. In vitro approaches are useful in discerning basic, cell-specific mechanistic information 
that will gain impact through in vivo models, beginning with the hilar clamp technique in nontransplanted 
animals and advancing into orthotopic lung transplant models, which may incorporate EVLP. Opportuni￾ties for collaboration exist between basic science labs that focus on in vitro models and bring mechanistic 
questions into laboratories with skilled microsurgeons and incorporating novel imaging procedures.
AR research. ACR research continues to employ the HTT model, which offers the benefit of technical 
feasibility. OTT, while more technically challenging than HTT, is favored for being a functional transplant 
and is also useful for studying microvascular changes during rejection. Orthotopic lung transplantation 
requires the greatest microsurgical expertise but offers the most relevant platform for evaluating changes of 
small airways and lung parenchyma. Immune tolerance, a process that directly counters AR, is also effec￾tively studied in the orthotopic lung transplant model. AMR, self-antigens that trigger autoimmunity, and 
disrupted lymphatic biology are important areas in development that will benefit through greater collabora￾tion by investigators using different surgical models.
CLAD research. OB research has employed the HTT model, which provides a facsimile of terminal air￾way fibrosis and is useful because of high throughput and the ease of pathological readout. While OTT is 
useful for examining large airway changes of chronic rejection, occlusive airway disease does not develop. 
The more demanding modeling of OB is in the orthotopic lung transplant model in mice; however, this tech￾nique has been limited by variably penetrant pathology and remains technically challenging. Because of the 
low-throughput nature of this surgery in mice and the relatively limited number of laboratories that success￾fully achieve consistent results, a significant opportunity for collaboration exists between groups to test their 
most promising mechanistic concepts in laboratories that regularly employ this technique. The contribution 
of the microbiome to host immunity is only beginning to be understood, and modulating the microbiome 
to be protective against CLAD is a promising area of research that will be facilitated by studies using the 
whole lung (133, 134). Finally, there is currently an unmet need for new models of RAS, an increasingly 
recognized manifestation of CLAD. Further work needs to be done in modeling other histologic manifesta￾tions of CLAD such as pleural and parenchymal upper lobe–dominant fibrosis that has been demonstrated 
in patients presenting with restrictive CLAD and the recently described acute fibrinous pneumonitis (135).
