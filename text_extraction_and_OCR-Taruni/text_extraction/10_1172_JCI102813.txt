INTRODUCTION
Patients with Laennec's cirrhosis and those with
occidental beri-beri frequently have the common
background of consumption of alcoholic beverages
and inadequate diet of long duration. A short cir￾culation time which may be found in occidental
beri-beri (1) and in Laennec's cirrhosis (2, 3) sug￾gests an elevated cardiac output. In the case of
beri-beri, this has been verified (4, 5, 6, 7), but, to
our knowledge, direct measurements of systemic
blood flow have not been reported in chronic liver
disease. Increased flow of blood to the periphery
in patients with Laennec's cirrhosis is suggested by
the frequent occurrence of warm extremities, cu￾taneous vascular spiders, wide pulse pressure, and
capillary pulsations in the nail beds.
The present study reports measurements of the
resting cardiac output, blood pressure, and periph￾eral resistance in patients with chronic alcoholism
and disease of the liver.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Selection of patients
Twenty-two hospitalized patients 8 with clinical and/or
laboratory evidence of chronic parenchymal disease of the
liver were studied. Only patients without clinical evi￾dence of co-existing heart disease and without evidence
of acute gastro-intestinal bleeding were included. All
subjects gave a history of excessive intake of alcoholic
beverages and an irregular and inadequate diet of long￾standing.
Of the 22 patients studied, three had "fatty liver," 11
had Laennec's cirrhosis without fluid retention, and
eight had Laennec's cirrhosis with either ascites or periph￾eral edema or both. Of the 19 patients with Laennec's

cirrhosis, all save one (No. 17) had enlargement of the
liver, and all but two (Nos. 11 and 18) had cutaneous vas￾cular spiders. All 22 patients had abnormally high Brom￾sulfalein retention.
A diagnosis of "fatty liver" was made clinically when
there was enlargement of the liver and laboratory evi￾dence of hepatic dysfunction without the following: icterus,
cutaneous vascular spiders, ascites, edema, splenomegaly,
or prominent abdominal veins.
PROCEDURES
Each patient was studied early in the morning without
any premedication, fasting and recumbent. An indwelling
needle was inserted into the left brachial artery and a
similar needle was placed into a right antecubital vein.
The patient then was allowed to rest -for at least twenty
minutes.
Cardiac output
The cardiac output was determined by the dye-injection
method as described by Hamilton and his co-workers (8).
Five mg. of a 0.5 per cent solution of Evans blue dye were
injected rapidly through the venous needle from a tubercu￾lin syringe previously calibrated by weighing. The dead
space of the indwelling needle was known and accounted
for in determining the amount of dye injected. Samples
of arterial blood were collected from the arterial needle
through a short length of polyethylene tubing into hepari￾nized tubes mounted along the rim of a circular lucite disc
equipped with funnels arranged so that spillage between
tubes was minimized. The disc was rotated about a cen￾trally placed vertical shaft by a variable-speed electric
motor. The usual collection time for each tube was two
and one-half seconds. Samples of arterial blood were cen￾trifuged for 20 minutes at 3,000 rpm. and the concentration
of dye in undiluted plasma was determined in micro-cells
of 0.5 cc. capacity at a wave length of 625 mu. using a
Beckmann Model DU spectrophotometer. In most pa￾tients duplicate estimations were made.
The cardiac index was calculated from the cardiac out￾put and the body surface area using the height and weight
at time of study irrespective of the presence or absence of
edema. In subjects with marked obesity and perhaps in
those with abnormal fluid retention, the body surface area
calculated according to Du Bois and Du Bois (9) might
distort the predicted value for cardiac index (10, 11). The
cardiac output also was expressed in terms of oxygen con￾sumption as a ratio by the formula:
Cardiac output L./min. X 100
Oxygen consumption cc./min.

Table I indicates values of cardiac index as reported by
others and as determined in this laboratory using the dye￾injection method in subjects who were considered es￾sentially normal. Also shown are values for the ratio of
cardiac output to oxygen consumption.
Oxygen consumption
Oxygen consumption was determined over a six-minute
period by means of a closed circuit water spirometer
filled with oxygen, after the cardiac output studies were
completed.
Arterial pressure
Phasic and mean arterial pressures were measured di￾rectly by means of an electromanometer of the condenser￾microphone type and recorded on a direct writing oscil￾lograph.4
Peripheral resistance
The formula used was (12):

Venous pressure
Venous pressure was estimated by means of a saline
manometer attached to the indwelling needle located in
the antecubital vein, and referred to a zero point 5 cm.
below the angle of Louis.
RESULTS
The data are found in Table II.
Cardiac output (Figure 1)
The mean cardiac index of patients with disease
of the liver was 4.26 L. per min. per M2, and the
standard deviation of the sample was ± 2.73 L. per
min. per M2. Values below the normal range were
not seen, and in seven patients they were above the
normal range.
As indicated in Figure 1, elevations of output
were noted in one of the three patients with "fatty
liver" as well as in patients with cirrhosis, irrespec￾tive of the presence or absence of abnormal fluid
retention or of jaundice.

disease. The third, fourth, and fifth are subdivisions of
column two. The mean for each group is indicated by the
dotted line. The shaded area represents the normal mean
+ two standard deviations of the sample.
Although one patient (No. 15) had a very high
cardiac index, 11.2 L. per min. per M2, this appar￾ently did not unduly influence the mean of 4.76 since
the median value for the series lay between 4.62
and 4.24 L. per min. per M2. (This individual was
restudied six weeks later at which time his cardiac
index was 16.3 L. per min. per M2 and his oxygen
consumption was 263 cc. per min.)

seen in Figure 3. The mean resistance of the seven
patients with high cardiac outputs was 596, a low

DISCUSSION
terse diam- The data indicate that the cardiac output deter￾ed outputs mined at rest and in recumbency may be normal or
Les. Heart distinctly elevated in patients with chronic alcohol￾ism and parenchymal disease of the liver.
When the output is increased, it is out of pro￾portion to the oxygen consumption or, by impli￾i eight pa- cation from the Fick formula (C.O. = oxygen
d Hallaran consumption/arterio-venous oxygen difference),
the arterio-venous oxygen difference must be de￾creased. The increase in blood flow is mainly ac￾complished by a larger output per beat. Since the
arterial pressures are essentially normal, the in￾creased blood flow is associated with decreased
total vascular resistance. The hemodynamic pic￾ture in these subjects with elevated outputs re￾sembles the high output state as seen in beri-beri
heart disease (4, 5, 6, 7) and in the "shunt circu￾lation" of arterio-venous fistulae (15, 16) or
Paget's disease (17).
Several factors might be involved in producing
the elevated outputs seen in one-third of the present
series:
2to - 2so Anxiety, which may elevate the cardiac output
(13, 18, 19), does not appear responsible for the
increase in blood flow since the subjects were re￾DIAC OUTPUT laxed, indifferent, and without overt resentment.

THE CARDIAC OUTPUT IN LAENNEC S CIRRHOSIS
Anemia, a frequent feature of parenchymal dis￾ease of the liver, is associated with an elevation of
cardiac output when the hemoglobin falls to about
7 Gm. per 100 cc. or the hematocrit to about 20
per cent (20). Anemia of such degree was not
seen in these patients, and since high values for
cardiac output were seen in subjects with normal
or near normal hematocrits, anemia does not ade￾quately explain the elevated output.
All subjects gave a history of longstanding con￾sumption of alcohol combined with a poor dietary
intake. This background is similar to that of pa￾tients with occidental beri-beri as reported by
Weiss and WiLkins (1) and by Blankenhorn (21).
However, in our patients, clinical evidence of thi￾amine deficiency, such as neuritis, was absent, ve￾nous pressure was not elevated, cardiac enlarge￾ment was not evident, and heart failure was not
seen. Four of the seven subjects with elevated out￾puts (Nos. 4, 5, 6, and 15) had been hospitalized
22 days or longer before study, and during this
time they consumed nutritious diets under super￾vision. Two of these four patients (Nos. 42 and
5), in addition, were given supplementary thiamine
chloride parenterally (Table II). In view of these
facts, occidental beri-beri seems unlikely as an
explanation of the elevated outputs seen in some
patients.
Elevated concentrations of blood pyruvic and
lactic acid have been noted in some patients with
cirrhosis (22, 23, 24). This raises the possibility
of impaired utilization of thiamine even in the pres￾ence of adequate amounts of the vitamin.
The high output state noted in some patients may
be related to a deficiency state other than beri-beri.
However, Howarth (25) studied the resting car￾diac output in 20 severely malnourished individuals
with hunger edema, and without evidence of vita￾min deficiencies. The outputs were normal or low.
The nutritional heart disease described in associa￾tion with liver disease in the South African Bantu
(26) also appears associated with normal or low
cardiac outputs at least at the stage of the disease
observed.
The existence of arterio-venous communications
in normal as well as in cirrhotic livers has been
demonstrated by Herrick, by Prinzmetal and his
co-workers, and by Dock (27, 28, 29). The role
of these communications in producing elevations of
cardiac output would not seem great since estimates
of hepatic blood flow and splanchnic arterio-ve￾nous oxygen difference (30, 31 ) suggest the
former is decreased and the latter increased in sub￾jects with cirrhosis.
The site of the increased blood flow thus would
seem to lie in the periphery of the body, and we
fall back on the concept suggested by Weiss and
Wilkins (1) in explanation of the circulatory
changes in beri-beri, namely that there exists gen￾eralized peripheral arteriolar dilatation, acting in
effect like multiple arterio-venous shunts in parallel.
Shorr, Zweifach, Furchtgott, and Baez (32)
have demonstrated that a vasodilator material,
VDM, is produced by the liver under anaerobic
conditions, and that it is inactivated by normal but
not by anoxic liver tissue. Moreover, VDM was
not inactivated under aerobic conditions by the
livers of cirrhotic rats (33). It is thus conceivable
that in human cirrhosis VDM is increased, or there
is an imbalance in the VDM-VEM system in
favor of VDM. This, then, could be a mechanism
involved in the production of peripheral vaso-dila￾tation.
In the final analysis, we do not know whether the
elevated outputs are related specifically to hepatic
disease, or to a form of chronic malnutrition, or
even whether they may represent the circulatory
response of certain patients with chronic alcohol￾ism to the laboratory situation.
The high incidence of prolongation of the Q-T
interval is of interest in relation to similar electro￾cardiographic findings observed in occidental beri￾beri (1), and in general deficiency states not re￾lated to thiamine deficiency (34). Prolongation
of the Q-T interval has been noted by other workers
in cirrhosis (35, 36).
SUMMARY
Observations made in 22 patients with a history
of alcoholism, and inadequate diet, and cirrhosis
of the liver indicate that the resting cardiac output
was elevated in one-third of the patients and was
associated with a large stroke volume, normal blood
pressure, and low peripheral vascular resistance.
Where the cardiac output was high, it was ele￾vated out of proportion to the oxygen consumption,
indicating a decreased arterio-venous oxygen dif￾ference.

It is suggested that dilatation of the peripheral
vascular bed is, responsible for the increased blood
flow.
