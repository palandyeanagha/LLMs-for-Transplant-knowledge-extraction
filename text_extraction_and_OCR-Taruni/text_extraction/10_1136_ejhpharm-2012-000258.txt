ABSTRACT
The calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs), ciclosporin and
tacrolimus, are the mainstay of immunosuppression
in solid organ transplantation. Generic formulations
of these drugs are now available. With increasing
pressure on healthcare budgets and the consequent
need to match health expectations to available
resources, substitution with a generic product appears
an attractive option to reduce costs. Approval of generic
products differs from innovator drugs, and narrow
therapeutic index drugs (NTIs; including CNIs) bring their
own particular considerations. With NTIs, small variations
in drug exposure could result in reduced
immunosuppression or drug toxicity with potentially
adverse effects on patient outcomes. NTIs are subject to
stricter regulatory approval versus many other generic
drugs. However, different generic formulations may still
not necessarily be therapeutically equivalent in
individuals, raising the possibility of significant
differences in exposure between products. Although
regional recommendations vary, many guidelines
emphasise the need for NTI drug substitution to be
initiated by the transplant physician, thus ensuring
careful therapeutic monitoring and reduced negative
patient impact. The need for therapeutic monitoring
during generic substitution has important implications for
the overall costs of generic treatment as these costs have
to be factored in to the potential savings made from
using generic formulations. The reduced acquisition costs
of generic products may not necessarily translate into
lower overall healthcare costs. This article examines the
issue of equivalence and interchangeability of NTI drugs
used in organ transplantation, the implications of the
approval process for generic drugs on treatment efficacy
and safety, and the effective management of
substitutions between products.
INTRODUCTION
The calcineurin inhibitors, ciclosporin and tacroli￾mus, have been the mainstay of immunosuppressive
therapy in solid organ transplantation over the
decades since their introduction.1 For these agents,
and the more recently introduced mammalian
target of rapamycin inhibitors (sirolimus and evero￾limus), the range of drug exposure between lack of
efficacy (under-immunosuppression) and increased
toxicity is small, leading them to be described as
critical dose drugs or narrow therapeutic index
(NTI) drugs.2–4 In addition, these immunosuppres￾sive therapies show a wide degree of variability in
pharmacokinetics between individual patients,
which means that routine therapeutic drug
monitoring is required to ensure optimal immuno￾suppression.5–8
For many immunosuppressive therapies, generic
formulations are now available as an alternative to
the original branded product. With increasing pres￾sure on healthcare budgets, and the consequent
need to match health expectations to the available
resources, substitution with a generic product
appears an attractive option to reduce costs.
Generics are widely and successfully used across
clinical practice; in the Netherlands in 2009, for
example, 57% of prescriptions were dispensed as
generic products.9 However, NTI immunosuppres￾sive drugs bring their own particular considera￾tions, as small variations in drug concentrations in
the blood could result in reduced immunosuppres￾sion or increased toxicity, with potentially adverse
effects on patient outcomes.2 8 10
This article builds upon existing knowledge11 by
examining the issue of equivalence and inter￾changeability of NTI drugs used in organ trans￾plantation, the implications of the different
approval processes for generic drugs on treatment
efficacy and safety, and how substitutions between
products can be managed effectively.
GENERIC DRUG APPROVAL AND
BIOEQUIVALENCE
The approval process for generic drugs differs from
that for innovator products (box 1). While a new
drug application (NDA) for an innovator drug
requires studies demonstrating safety and efficacy,
and postmarketing surveillance data to ensure that
any adverse events are tracked effectively, a generic
product needs an abbreviated NDA. Provided the
generic has the same dosage form, same route of
administration and same amount of active ingredi￾ent as the innovator, and is produced following
good manufacturing practice, the generic product
simply has to demonstrate bioequivalence to the
branded drug.12 13 Safety and efficacy studies are
not required as these have already been performed
for the original product. Importantly, there is no
requirement to demonstrate therapeutic equiva￾lence between the two products; this is assumed
based on their bioequivalence.2
Bioequivalence can be regarded as a biological
quality assessment test. Both the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) and European Medicines
Agency (EMA) guidelines recommend that bioequi￾valence is measured using a standard single-dose
randomised, two-period, two-sequence single-dose
design.14 For this reason, bioequivalence studies are
typically crossover studies conducted in a small

group of usually between 24 and 52 healthy volunteers.15 16 In
a typical two-by-two or AB/BA design, one half of the group
receives the test (generic) product first, followed by a washout
period, and then the reference (innovator) drug; for the other
half of the group, the order of the products is reversed.17
Although very rarely done, the crossover design can be extended
to include more than two treatments per subject in consecutive
periods or more than two sequences, that is, so-called, high￾order crossover designs (eg, AABB/BBAA or AA/BB/AB/BA).
Blood concentration data are collected for each group, and
pharmacokinetic parameters (maximum drug concentration
[Cmax], time to reach Cmax [tmax] and area under the concentra￾tion/time curve [AUC]) are calculated to determine the extent
and rate of exposure. The relative bioavailability of the two for￾mulations is then evaluated from these parameters to determine
equivalence derived from standard reference tests (analysis of
variance).18 The ratio of the geometric mean value for the test
formulation to the mean value for the reference formulation is
calculated for Cmax and AUC, and the 90% CI for the mean
ratio has to be within a specified interval in order for bioequiva￾lence to be demonstrated.
For most drugs, a difference of 20% between products is used
to define bioequivalence,12 although some regulators have intro￾duced stricter guidelines for NTI drugs (as discussed below).
Taking values for the reference formulation of 100 and for the
test product of 80, the test to reference ratio (80/100) gives the
lower limit for the bioequivalence interval of 0.80 or 80%,
while the reference to test ratio (100/80) gives the upper limit
of 1.25 or 125%. So for bioequivalence to be established, the
mean ratio and its 90% CI must lie between 0.80 and 1.25 or
80% to 125%—a difference of ±20%.12
It is, however, important to note that bioequivalence relates
to the mean of the data for the study population, so values for
individual subjects may lie outside the bioequivalence intervals,
even though the mean ratios (and CIs) are within the limits. For
example, data from a bioequivalence study comparing generic
and branded formulations of ciclosporin showed that almost
40% of individuals receiving the generic formulation were
below the 80% limit for the mean ratio for Cmax, with two indi￾viduals receiving a maximum drug concentration approximately
40% lower than with the branded formulation (figure 1).
Nevertheless, since the 90% CIs of the mean ratios for Cmax
and AUC fell within the 80% to 125% limits, the formulation
was considered bioequivalent.
BIOEQUIVALENCE AND INTERCHANGEABILITY
The approval process for generic drugs also raises the question
of interchangeability between different generic formulations as
each one only has to demonstrate bioequivalence to the innov￾ator drug. Thus, although two generic formulations (A and B)
may each show bioequivalence to the branded product, generic
A may not be bioequivalent to generic B, as the 90% CIs for the
mean ratios could lie outside the 80%–125% limits (figure 2A).
In the included example, a patient who was switched from
generic A to generic B would, on average, receive 52% more
drug, while conversion from B to A would reduce exposure by
28% on average. Furthermore, these differences could be larger
for individual patients. There are, however, a number of math￾ematical models, which claim to address the potential inter￾changeability between different generic formulations through
indirect comparisons.19 20 In one such analysis, Herranz and
colleagues (2013) concluded that generic products were not
only bioequivalent with the reference product but also with
each other; however, the 80%–125% limits used in these ana￾lyses are now considered inappropriate for NTI drugs.21
The potential for such large changes in exposure between dif￾ferent formulations has led some regulatory authorities to intro￾duce tighter bioequivalence limits for NTI drugs or critical dose
drugs, such as tacrolimus.3 4 12 In Europe, for these drugs the
limit is ±10%, so the mean ratios for test to reference product
(and the 90% CIs) have to be in the range of 90% to 111% to
show bioequivalence.3 12 Although it is still possible that generic
products will not show bioequivalence to one another, the stric￾ter bioequivalence limits mean that potential differences in
exposure between the generic formulations are reduced (figure
2B). However, this variability is still a concern, particularly
where large numbers of different generic formulations are avail￾able for a given drug, as multiple substitutions between the
various products could lead to considerable variability in expos￾ure, which may result in poor long-term outcomes.22
THERAPEUTIC EQUIVALENCE
The approval of generic drugs using bioequivalence studies is
based on the fundamental assumption that if two formulations

are shown to be bioequivalent, they will provide the same thera￾peutic effect. In other words, they will be therapeutically
equivalent and are therefore interchangeable. However, evi￾dence from studies with ciclosporin, and more recently, tacroli￾mus, suggests that this is not necessarily the case for the NTI
drugs in transplantation.
Initial retrospective analyses of kidney transplant data from
the Collaborative Transplant Study database23 suggested that
patients treated with generic ciclosporin may have reduced
1-year graft survival compared with those receiving the branded
formulation of ciclosporin, Neoral (Novartis Pharmaceuticals).24
Of 17 198 renal transplant recipients who received organs from
deceased donors between 1998 and 2000, graft survival was
approximately 90% in 16 801 patients who received the
branded formulation compared with around 80% in the 397
patients who received the generic drug. Stratification of the data
for geographical region in order to reduce bias showed an
unfavourable trend for generic ciclosporin in all of the regions
assessed, although limited published details on the methodology
and observance to treatment prohibit any definitive conclusions
to be drawn from this study.23
A retrospective review of 188 de novo kidney transplant
patients at a single centre showed a significantly higher rate of
biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) with the generic ciclos￾porin Gengraf (Abbott Laboratories) than with Neoral.24
Patients receiving Gengraf were significantly more likely to have
a BPAR episode or a second rejection episode compared with
those treated with Neoral (table 1). In addition, significantly
more Gengraf-treated patients received an antibody preparation
to treat acute rejection than those receiving Neoral (table 1).
Although mean 12-h trough concentrations of ciclosporin were
similar with the two formulations, patients treated with Gengraf
had significantly higher intrapatient variability for ciclosporin
trough concentrations than those treated with Neoral
(p<0.05).24
Previous studies have shown that increased within-patient
variability in ciclosporin concentrations is associated with
poorer outcomes and higher treatment costs following trans￾plantation.25–28 An analysis of 204 transplant recipients showed
that the time to chronic rejection over 5 years was significantly
longer among patients with less variable ciclosporin concentra￾tions than those with variable concentrations.27 Similar findings
have been observed with tacrolimus therapy. A study of 297
kidney transplant recipients at a single centre showed that low
within-patient variability in tacrolimus clearance was associated
with significantly better graft survival compared with high
within-patient variability (figure 3).29 Patients with low variabil￾ity in tacrolimus trough levels also showed significantly lower
acute rejection rates and higher 1-year graft survival than those
with high variability in a recent study of over 250 adult kidney
transplant recipients.22 Within this setting, other factors, such as
interaction with food or other drugs and timing of trough
levels, are also important considerations in ensuring low within￾patient variability. Data comparing generic and branded formu￾lations of tacrolimus are more limited than for ciclosporin, as
generic tacrolimus has only recently become available, whereas
generic ciclosporin has been available for over a decade.
However, a recent study examined the effects on predose tacro￾limus trough concentrations of switching from the branded for￾mulation (PROGRAF; Astellas Pharma) to a generic formulation
(Adoport; Sandoz) in 103 clinically stable kidney and liver trans￾plant patients.30 Treatments were switched on a milligram-for￾milligram basis, and patients were carefully monitored before

outside the bioequivalence limits.

and after conversion. Both kidney and liver transplant patients
showed marked changes in tacrolimus trough concentrations fol￾lowing the switch to generic tacrolimus. Among the subgroup of
30 kidney and 30 liver transplant recipients who remained on
the same dosing regimen throughout the study period, mean
reductions in tacrolimus trough concentrations were 0.87 ng/mL
and 1.98 ng/mL, respectively, after adjusting for all significant
covariates.30 The changes seen in both groups were appreciable,
considering the low target trough levels in the study (kidney, 5–
7 ng/mL; liver, 6–8 ng/mL). Decreases in tacrolimus blood levels
of at least 25% were observed in 40% of the kidney transplant
patients and 33% of the liver transplant recipients (figure 4).30
Despite the lower concentration-to-dose (C/D) ratios and a
small but significant drop in tacrolimus concentrations, the
authors concluded that transplant patients can be safely
switched from the branded formulation to the generic tacroli￾mus formulation ‘provided trough concentrations are closely
monitored following the substitution’.
30
Two subsequent studies31 32 have shown that trough levels are
similar before and after conversion from branded to generic
tacrolimus. However, McDevitt-Potter et al31 reported a sub￾stantial increase in the number of dose adjustments required in
patients after conversion from the branded formulation to the
generic formulation compared with 6 months prior to conver￾sion (21% vs 7%, respectively; p=0.028). Both groups suggest
that switching should be performed carefully with vigilance and
increased therapeutic drug monitoring, thus recognising that
variability between formulations is an issue.31 32 With reference
to interchangeability between different tacrolimus formulations,
the correlation between C12 and AUC across different formula￾tions needs to be established. In the absence of this information
it cannot be presumed that when patients are switched between
formulations (either branded to generic or from generic to
generic formulations) that the same trough levels will achieve
the same AUC. Alloway et al33 assessed the correlation between
C12 and AUC for conversion from branded formulation to a
single generic formulation; this information, however, cannot be
applied to other generic formulations. Furthermore, there is a
risk for uncontrolled switching between generic formulations
where the correlation between C12 and AUC is not established,
thereby exposing the patient to substantial risk and inconsisten￾cies in tacrolimus exposure.
These findings are echoed in recent advice from Sandoz to
transplant centres in the UK about the use of the generic tacroli￾mus formulation, Adoport, which states that ‘oral tacrolimus
formulations are not interchangeable without careful therapeutic
monitoring’ and warns that ‘inadvertent, unintentional or
unsupervised switching between different oral formulations of
tacrolimus can lead to graft rejection or an increased incidence
of undesirable effects’.
34 So even though the generic
formulation has demonstrated bioequivalence to the branded
formulation, the two are not interchangeable without thera￾peutic drug monitoring.
The need for careful monitoring is also emphasised in an edi￾torial published in response to the study by Momper et al.
35
This calls for the introduction of tighter regulations by the US
FDA for demonstrating bioequivalence for generic immunosup￾pressive drugs, together with a requirement for the studies to be
performed in transplant recipients (one study for each organ
recipient group) rather than healthy volunteers, as drug pharma￾cokinetics are known to be different in liver and kidney trans￾plant patients. The author concluded that until such changes are
in place, patients’ health is being jeopardised if ‘vigilant thera￾peutic drug monitoring’ is not performed.35 In practice,
however, it would be difficult to control for significant confoun￾ders, such as the impact of drug interactions on tacrolimus
serum concentrations, and for this reason, differences in the
drug formulations would be extremely difficult to detect.36
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR GENERIC SUBSTITUTION
The rise in the availability of generic formulations coupled with
concerns over the therapeutic equivalence of NTI drugs has led
to a number of transplantation organisations offering guidance
on the use of generic immunosuppressive agents.37–39 Typically,
these recommendations emphasise the need for the transplant
physician to authorise any substitutions.38 39 The Kidney
Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice
guidelines advise caution in choosing a generic formulation for
treating kidney transplant recipients, as head-to-head compari￾son data for efficacy and toxicity are generally not available for
most generics.37 They state that ‘ideally, a generic formulation
should be used only after its safety and efficacy have been estab￾lished in kidney transplant recipients’. The Efficacy and Safety
of PRescribing In Transplantation Group (ESPRIT) website
(http://www.esprit.org.uk/) provides information and resources
to support the safe use of generic substitution.
The European Society for Organ Transplantation (ESOT)
recently published its advisory committee recommendations on
the generic substitution of immunosuppressive drugs.39 ESOT
makes clear that, as a society, it is not against the use of generic
immunosuppressive products. Rather, its aim is to ensure that
substitutions occur in a controlled manner, with the appropriate
therapeutic monitoring in place to ensure that drug exposure is
maintained and outcomes are unaffected. ESOT therefore pro￾vides a number of key recommendations regarding generic sub￾stitutions, outlined below.
▸ Generic formulations that do not meet the current stricter
bioequivalence criteria should not be used, while the use of
compounds that were approved before the current guidelines
were introduced and are still available should be discouraged

until they have demonstrated bioequivalence according to
the new EMA guidelines.
▸ Substitution of the brand name drug for the generic formula￾tion should only be initiated by the transplant physician, to
ensure that the appropriate monitoring of drug blood con￾centrations takes place following the switch, and pharmacists
and health insurance providers should refrain from forcing
generic substitutions. This aims to avoid the situation where
drug exposure is not monitored because the prescriber is
unaware of the substitution, leading to the risk of under￾exposure or overexposure.
▸ Repetitive (consecutive) substitutions between different
generic formulations of the same drug should be avoided.
Prescribers are often unaware of such substitutions, and
changes in exposure can be more pronounced than for the
change from branded product to generic product (as dis￾cussed above). Furthermore, the repeated switching between
generic formulations can prove confusing for patients and
lead to mistakes with dosing.
▸ Patients should be informed about generic substitution and
taught how to identify the different formulations of the same
drug, and they should alert the transplant physician if an
uncontrolled substitution is made. The guidelines emphasise
that pharmacists have an active role to play in both informing
the patient about the newly prescribed formulation when
generic substitution is initiated by the prescribing physician,
and protecting the patient from subsequent substitutions.
▸ The simultaneous use of different formulations in the same
patient should be avoided as this could be confusing for the
patient and lead to unpredictable pharmacokinetics and
increased variability in exposure.
▸ The guidelines also emphasise the role of the transplant com￾munity in collecting data on the use of generic immunosup￾pressive formulations in transplant patients, so enabling a
comprehensive picture of all aspects of these drugs (including
pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety) to be assembled.
McDevitt-Potter et al showed that when dose requirements
and trough levels are similar between branded and generic tacro￾limus, generic substitutions may be associated with cost savings.
However, this paper discusses switching from the branded drug
to only one generic formulation and the impact of switching to
other or between generic formulations was not tested.31 Indeed,
there is potential for switching to multiple formulations of
generic drugs that enter the market at various time points. The
need for careful therapeutic monitoring during generic substitu￾tion has important implications for the overall costs of generic
treatment, as the costs of monitoring and dealing with patients’
concerns have to be factored in.40 The reduced acquisition costs
of generic products may not translate into lower overall health￾care costs if the additional monitoring outweighs the reductions
in drug costs. In the absence of data on interchangeability
between different generic formulations, it is therefore not pos￾sible to conclude on the economic impact of switching from
branded to generic formulations.
To date, published direct healthcare cost assessments are
limited to generic substitution from product brands. One such
US study in de novo renal transplant recipients showed that
patients receiving generic ciclosporin incurred significantly
higher total healthcare costs over the course of a year compared
with those treated with branded ciclosporin, despite initial per￾ceived cost savings associated with the generic formulation.41
Potential savings from reduced drug costs associated with
generic substitution therefore need to be evaluated in light of
the overall healthcare costs within each healthcare setting.
CONCLUSIONS
A large number of generic formulations of immunosuppressive
drugs are currently available, with the numbers set to rise over
the next few years as more patents expire, while increasing pres￾sures on healthcare budgets are likely to increase the demand for
their use. However, approval of generic products differs from
innovator drugs. It is based on bioequivalence to the innovator
drug (but not to other generic formulations), while therapeutic
equivalence is assumed based on bioequivalence. Consequently,
different generic formulations may not necessarily be bioequiva￾lent to each other, raising the possibility of significant differences
in exposure between different products. In addition, it is not
clear how different generic products compare with existing for￾mulations in terms of therapeutic efficacy and the risk of adverse
events. Immunosuppressive drugs, such as tacrolimus and ciclos￾porin, are NTI drugs, and so small changes in exposure could
result in increased toxicity or reduced immunosuppression.
Conversion to a generic formulation therefore requires careful
clinical and therapeutic drug monitoring to ensure that optimal
immunosuppression is maintained; hence, generic substitution
must only be performed under the close supervision of a trans￾plant specialist. Moreover, the costs of this supervision need to
be taken into account when assessing the overall healthcare costs
associated with generic substitution.
