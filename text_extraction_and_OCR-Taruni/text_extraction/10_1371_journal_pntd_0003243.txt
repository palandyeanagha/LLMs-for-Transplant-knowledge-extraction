Abstract
Background: Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are different from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) both in their
ubiquitous environmental distribution and in their reduced capacity to cause disease. While often neglected in favour of
other infectious diseases, NTM may interfere with important aspects of TB control and management, namely the efficacy of
new anti-tuberculosis (TB) vaccines; the immuno-diagnostic Tuberculin skin test (TST) and QuantiFERON TB Gold In Tube
assay (QFTGIT); and immune biomarkers explored for their diagnostic and/or predictive potential. Our objective was
therefore to explore host immune biomarkers in children who had NTM isolated from respiratory and/or gastric specimens.
Methodology and Principle Findings: The present study was nested within a prospective cohort study of BCG-vaccinated
neonates in Southern India. In this setting, immune biomarkers from peripheral blood were analyzed in 210 children aged ,
3 years evaluated for TB using dual-colour-Reverse-Transcriptase-Multiple-Ligation-dependent-Probe-Amplification (dcRT￾MLPA) and Bio-Plex assays. The children were classified based on clinical examination, chest X-rays and mycobacterial
culture reports as either: 1) TB disease, 2) NTM present and 3) controls. The study shows a down-regulation of RAB33A (p,
0.001) and up-regulation of TGFb1, IL-2 and IL-6 (all p,0.05) in children with TB disease, and that RAB33A, TGFBR2 and IL-10
(all p,0.05) were differentially expressed in children with NTM present when compared to children that were culture
negative for MTB and NTM (controls).
Conclusions and Significance: Carriage of NTM may reduce the specificity of future diagnostic and predictive immune
biomarkers relevant to TB management.

Introduction
Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are widely distributed in
soil and water [1]. The innumerable species comprising the genus
Mycobacterium have differences in pathogenicity, virulence,
response to drugs, in-vivo adaptation and growth characteristics
[2]. Pathogens of the genus Mycobacteria are responsible for
serious human diseases, including tuberculosis (TB) and leprosy.
However, the host-pathogen interactions during atypical (non￾tuberculous) mycobacterial infection remain poorly characterized
[3,4]. In recent years, NTM infection is recognized to play a role
in exacerbation of chronic pulmonary disorders, e.g. cystic fibrosis
and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the cause of TB￾like disease in the immunocompromised [5]. The data on the
prevalence of NTM in TB-endemic countries is limited. The
probable factors for under-reporting of NTM are lack of:
awareness, standardized or accepted criteria to define NTM
respiratory disease and laboratory infrastructure to identify NTM
[2].
Furthermore, in the context of TB, the background prevalence
of NTM is discussed [6], as one of the factors explaining the
variable efficacy of the BCG vaccine in clinical trials (0–90%) [7].

Subjects with high purified protein derivative (PPD)-specific IFN-c
responses (from NTM exposure) prior to BCG-vaccination have
reduced PPD-specific IFN-c responses post-vaccination compared
to subjects with lower responses pre-vaccination, suggesting an
inhibition of BCG efficacy by prior NTM exposure [6,8].
Inhibition of BCG efficacy by prior exposure to NTM has also
been demonstrated in vivo in animal models [9]. These findings
indicate that NTM exposure affects anti-mycobacterial host
immune responses raising the possibility of interference with novel
immune read-outs, explored for their potential as new diagnostics
or immune-correlates of protection from TB progression [10,11].
Unraveling these aspects are important, given that new diagnostics
are needed, particularly in populations with a high proportion of
unconfirmed TB cases, such as young children [12] and in
immunocompromised subjects the latter having an increased risk
of NTM-related disease. Immune-correlates of protection from TB
progression are also needed for vaccine efficacy trials and targeted
preventive treatment of subjects latently infected with M.
tuberculosis (MTB). Furthermore, the presence of NTM likely
interferes with the established immuno-diagnostic methods: the
Tuberculin skin test (TST) and the QuantiFERON TB Gold in
tube assay (QFTGIT), both of which demonstrate a varying
degree of cross-reaction with a limited number of NTM species
[13]. A recent study from a TB-endemic country shows that NTM
were isolated in 6% of all children investigated for pulmonary TB
[14]. In our previous study evaluating diagnostic immune
biomarkers for MTB infection and disease in young children,
the high prevalence of NTM isolates in clinical specimens (from
,30% children without TB disease) made us query to what extent
the presence of NTM may mask biomarker differences between
children with TB disease, MTB infection and MTB uninfected
controls [15]. To our knowledge, immune responses in children in
a TB endemic setting with NTM exposure have not been
previously characterized.
Based on these knowledge gaps, our objective was therefore to
explore immune responses in children with NTM isolated from
respiratory and/or gastric specimens. In the setting of a
longitudinal cohort study of BCG-vaccinated neonates in southern
India, we analyzed a pre-selected panel of transcriptional and
translational biomarkers in 210 children evaluated for TB and
classified according to their chest X-ray (CXR) and mycobacterial
culture reports. The immune biomarkers in children with NTM
present were compared with responses in children that were
culture negative for MTB and NTM (controls) and children with
TB disease but without NTM present (TB patients). Initially,
children with NTM present were analyzed regardless of their TST
and QFTGIT results and subsequently reanalyzed based on
responses to these tests, in order to determine to what extent the
results were modulated by latent MTB infection.
Materials and Methods
Study details and classification of study subjects
The sample collection and study design have been described in
detail elsewhere [15]. Briefly, 4382 neonates all BCG-vaccinated
within 72 hours of delivery were enrolled within 2 weeks of birth
following parental consent. The study was conducted at the
Palamaner Taluk, Chittoor district, Southern India. The recruited
children were randomly (based on the population units where they
were born) assigned to active (visited bimonthly; to check for
recent TB contact, symptoms and anthropometry; N = 2215) and
passive (TB education given to parents/guardian but with no
scheduled home visits; N = 2167) surveillance arms, and moni￾tored at fixed time points as outlined in the study protocol for 2
consecutive years. During the study period, 746 children were
referred to a TB case verification ward (CVW) on suspicion of TB.
Referral criteria were 1) respiratory symptoms suggestive of TB
(cough $2 weeks), failure to thrive (FTT) defined as any of the
following; (a) unexplained weight loss or no weight-gain for two
consecutive visits; (b) downward crossing of two percentile lines on
the weight-for-age growth chart or (c) weight persistently tracking
below the 3rd percentile of weight for age growth chart 2) a history
of known TB exposure or 3) a TST $10 mm at study closure. The
diagnostic assessment included: clinical examination, a CXR
anteroposterior view, two induced sputa (IS) and gastric aspirates
(GA) on consecutive days (for smear and culture), TST (2 TU/
0.1 mL of PPD RT-23; Span Diagnostics, Ltd., Bangalore, India)
and QFTGIT (Cellestis Inc, Valencia, California, USA). IS and
GA samples were examined by fluorescent microscopy (Auramine)
and culture using liquid (Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube)
and solid (Lo¨wenstein-Jensen) medium [16]. Positive cultures were
confirmed by the HAIN kit (GenoType MTBC, Hain Life
Sciences, Germany). Direct PCR (The COBAS TaqMan MTB
Test, Roche) was undertaken on culture negative specimens for
infants with CXR findings suggestive of TB.
From the 746 children investigated at the CVW, the 210
children included in this study were originally selected for an
exploratory study of biomarkers with a diagnostic potential in
young children assessed for TB disease and MTB infection. All
children with clinical TB disease (n = 13) were included. They
were diagnosed by the identification of MTB in culture or by PCR
(Roche PCR test) (n = 4) or; in the case of cultures negative for
MTB and NTM, by pathology consistent with TB at CXR as
judged by 2/3 radiologists (n = 9). Children without TB disease
(normal CXR and culture negative for MTB), but presumed to be
infected based on positive results for TST and/or QFTGIT
(n = 90), were also included. In addition, gender matched MTB
uninfected controls (normal CXR and culture negative for MTB,
TST and QFTGIT negative; n = 107) were selected amongst other
investigated children.
For the purpose of this study, the 210 children were re-classified
according to whether they had TB disease (n = 13) as previously
defined, or no TB judged by culture negativity for MTB and a
normal CXR, the latter group (no TB) were further subdivided as
either NTM present (defined by $1 specimen culture positive for
Author Summary
Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are a ubiquitous
group of mycobacteria found in the environment. They are
opportunistic pathogens causing human disease, especial￾ly in immunocompromised individuals. Differentiation
between NTM infection and tuberculosis (TB) can be
difficult. Data on incidence of NTM in TB endemic
countries is limited due to resource intensive methods
required for identification and a considerable workload
due to other diseases. The present study was based on
children investigated for TB and classified according to
chest X-rays and mycobacterial culture reports. We
explored host immune biomarkers which are potentially
relevant to TB management, in children with confirmed
NTM exposure. The findings from the present study
suggest that NTM exposure modulates TB-relevant im￾mune biomarkers in the host by eliciting some of the same
immune responses as MTB infection. This is may be of
importance when evaluating immunological correlates of
protection in the setting of TB vaccine trials and potential
TB diagnostic biomarkers.

NTM; n = 52) or culture negative for MTB and NTM, referred to
as controls (n = 145) (Fig. 1). Notably, none of the children with
NTM present fulfilled the criteria for NTM disease suggested by
the American Thoracic Society, NTM disease should be
considered if there is (i) a compatible clinical presentation, (ii) a
radiographic picture consistent with the diagnosis of NTM, (iii)
exclusion of other diagnoses, and (iv) the recovered NTM species is
present in sufficient quantities from consecutive specimens [5].

Confirmation of NTM
Acid fast bacteria (AFB) culture positive samples were speciated
by the HAIN kit (GenoType MTBC and CM), Hain Life Sciences,
Germany). The HAIN CM kit identifies only 15 commonly
isolated NTMs [17]. AFB culture positive samples that were
identified as non-MTB complex mycobacteria, but which could
not be further speciated by the HAIN CM kit are designated as
NTM species in this study.
Sample processing for immune biomarker analysis
For identifying biomarkers at the transcriptional level, a method
which uses a pre-selected panel of genes, dual-colour reverse￾transcriptase – multiplex-ligation-dependent-probe-amplification
(dcRT-MLPA) was applied [18]. The genes in the panel consisted
of 4 housekeeping genes, used as internal controls, and 45 genes
identified as differentially expressed during MTB infection and/or
disease in adults, by screening of different populations by qPCR
and microarray [18]. Total RNA was extracted from PAXgene
blood collection tubes (n = 210) using the ‘PAXgene Blood RNA
kit’ (PreAnalytiX, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufac￾turer’s instructions. RNA concentration and purity (A260/280 nm
ratio) was measured using a spectrophotometer (Thermoscientific,
Delaware, USA).
For the dcRT-MLPA experiment, 130–150 ng of total RNA was
used. The dcRT-MLPA experimental protocol has been described
in detail previously [15,18]. The amplified PCR products were
diluted 1:10 with nuclease free H2O and added to a mixture of Hi￾Di-Formamide with 400HD ROX size standard. The denatured (at
95uC for 5 min) products, were immediately cooled on ice.
Fragment analysis was performed on a 3730 capillary sequencer
(Life Technologies, California, USA), and the data imported into
the Gene mapper software (Life Technologies, California, USA).
The peak area data (arbitrary units) of replicates was averaged,
normalized against GAPDH, and log2 transformed as described
[18]. Of the 45 genes analyzed, 7 genes had expression levels below
the cut off value of 7.64 (corresponding to a peak area ,200
arbitrary units) and one gene CD14, co-localized with a primer￾dimer peak and was therefore omitted from analysis.
For the identification of biomarkers at the translational level,
supernatants from the QFTGIT assay (Nil and TB-ag tubes)
(n = 210) were analyzed by a customized 10-plex cytokine/
chemokine kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., California, USA). For
data analysis, the cytokine/chemokine concentrations (pg/mL) in
the Nil and TB-ag tubes were used and analyzed individually.
Statistical analysis
Differences in biomarkers (as measured by dcRT-MLPA and
the Bio-Plex assay) between groups were evaluated by non￾parametric analysis (Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test
with Dunn’s post-hoc test for multiple comparison) using IBM
SPSS software version 21. A double sided p-value,0.05 was
considered significant. GraphPad Prism 5 software was used for
graphing the dot plots.
Ethics approval
The study was conducted according to the Helsinki (4th revision)
declaration and approved by the institutional ethical review board
of the St. John’s Medical College and an independent ethics
committee contracted by the Aeras Global TB Vaccine Founda￾tion. At the time of participant enrollment a written informed
consent was obtained from parents/guardians. This study was also
approved by the Ministry of Health Screening Committee of the
Government of India (No. 5/8/9/60/20006-ECD-I).
Results
Characteristics of study groups
The participants selected for this study were a subset of 210
children selected from a larger (n = 4382) longitudinal cohort study
based on the availability of a full clinical workup and a full array of
blood samples (Fig. 1). Baseline characteristics of the 210 children
categorized by study groups are presented in Table 1. The gender
distribution was similar between the groups. Children with NTM
present had the same frequency of respiratory symptoms as
controls, whereas as expected, children with TB disease had more
respiratory symptoms than the other two groups (for both groups
p = 0.03). Children with NTM present had less known exposure to
TB (,2%) than the other two groups, but more frequently had
FTT (85%; p = 0.07). NTM were isolated from IS and GA
samples with the same frequency, whereas MTB was only isolated
from GA. NTM isolates (42.3%) that could not be identified at the
species level by the HAIN CM kit were designated as Mycobac￾terium species (M. spp.). The majority of NTMs that could be
speciated by the HAIN test were: Mycobacterium fortuitum
(40.4%) and Mycobacterium intracellulare (15.4%). About 3.0%
of children were culture positive for NTMs on two consecutive
days and samples that had the same NTM species cultured on
both days were low (,1%) (Table 2).
Biomarker profiles in children with NTM present
compared to controls
We first assessed the effect of the presence of NTM on immune
biomarkers in the presumed target population for TB booster
vaccines: BCG-vaccinated children without TB disease. Of 45
biomarkers tested (Table S1), there was no appreciable change for
most, but transcription of mRNA for RAB33A and TGFBR2 was
down-regulated (p,0.05) in children with NTM present (n = 52)
compared to controls (Fig. 2a). Bio-plex analysis on unstimulated
QFTGIT supernatants (Nil tube) showed that compared to
controls, the expression of cytokine IL-10 (p,0.05) was up￾regulated in children with NTM present (Fig. 2 b).
Comparison of biomarker profiles between children with
TB disease, NTM present and controls
We next assessed the potential effect of the presence of NTM on
biomarkers in a TB diagnostic setting. Compared to controls
(n = 145) and children with NTM present (n = 52), the direct ex
vivo transcription of RAB33A was down-regulated (p,0.001; p,
0.05, respectively) in children with TB disease (n = 13; Fig. 3a).
Furthermore, Bio-plex analysis on unstimulated whole blood
QFTGIT supernatants (Nil tube) showed that the expression of
cytokine IL-6 was up-regulated in TB disease (p,0.05) compared
to controls (Fig. 3b). Similarly, the analysis from stimulated whole
blood QFTGIT supernatants (TB-ag tube) showed that the
expression of cytokine IL-2 was up-regulated (p,0.05) in children
with TB disease compared to controls (Fig. 3c). Interestingly, these
differences between children with TB disease and controls were
not evident in our earlier study [15], when children with TB
disease were compared to controls (TST and QFTGIT negative
children), presumably because 33 of 107 of these controls had
NTM present.
In the analyses above, the groups of children with NTM present
and controls contained children with divergent results for TST
and QFTGIT. Children with positive TST and/or QFTGIT tests
may have latent TB infection. This is likely to have increased the
immunological heterogeneity within these groups. We therefore,
repeated the analyses above with ‘‘cleaner’’ groups consisting of
TST and QFT negative children only: children with NTM present

(n = 33); and controls (n = 74). This sub-analysis identified the
same differences as above with regard to a down-regulation of
RAB33A (p,0.001) and an up-regulation of IL-2 (p,0.001) in
children with TB disease (Fig. 4a and 4b). In addition, this analysis
also revealed an up-regulated transcription of TGFb1 (p,0.05) in
children with TB disease compared to the other two groups (for
both p,0.05) (Fig. 4a).
Discussion
In the context of TB disease management, a likely impact of
NTM on the TB protection induced by the BCG vaccine is well
recognized although the mechanisms are unclear. BCG is used as
the ‘‘gold standard’’ for induction of protective immune responses
against TB in humans, however, there is consensus that it does not
induce complete protection against TB in any animal species [19].
Also, clinical trials have shown varying efficacy of the BCG
vaccine, and multiple reasons have been suggested, including a
potential role for NTM exposure [20]. The immuno-modulating
properties of NTM are also likely to affect studies of TB-diagnostic
biomarkers as well as immuno-correlates of TB protection by
which it is hoped the efficacy of new TB vaccines can be evaluated
[21].
In the present study of children, all BCG-vaccinated at birth
and aged ,3 years, we show that the genes TGFBR2, RAB33A
and the cytokine IL-10 were differentially expressed in children
with NTM-positive cultures compared to controls. Background
exposure of NTM in the setting of a vaccine trial might therefore
interfere with these markers if used as correlates of protection.
RAB33A is a member of small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)
family and is involved in vesicle transport and fusion [22].
Dysregulation of GTPases has shown to play a role in blocking the
phagosome maturation [23] which is a major survival strategy for
MTB [24]. TGFBR2 is involved in signal transduction and
mediating inhibition of cell growth and induction of cell death
[25,26]. IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine which in the

setting of MTB infection inhibits CD4 T-cell responses and
dendritic cell functions [27].
We and others have shown that, RAB33A seems to have a
potential as a diagnostic marker of TB disease [15,28,29]. With
this study we add that the expression of RAB33A is reduced in
children with TB disease compared to children without TB
regardless of TST/QFTGIT results or NTM presence. When
restricting the comparison of children with NTM present to those
with a negative TST and QFTGIT result (to control for potential
effects of MTB infection), we found no significant difference in the
transcription of RAB33A between children with TB disease and
those with NTM present. However, the median value for NTM￾positive children consistently lay between that of the TB cases and
the mycobacteria-negative children so this result may reflect the
smaller sample size of this group or that down-regulation of
RAB33A is more strongly impacted by disease, rather than
carriage/infection with mycobacteria. Nevertheless, the reduced
transcription of RAB33A in children with NTM present
compared to controls raises the possibility of an impact of NTM
presence on the specificity if RAB33A were to be used in a
diagnostic setting. Furthermore, as we have published earlier
TGFb1 appears to be up-regulated in children with TB disease
compared to MTB uninfected children [15]. This study provides
evidence that TGFb1 is up-regulated in children with TB disease
regardless of NTM presence, but only in TST and QFTGIT
negative children, suggesting that MTB infection may also be
modulating expression of this gene, but that NTM exposure does
not. In contrast, increased levels of IL-2 and IL-6 in children with
TB disease was only seen compared to MTB negative controls and
not compared to children with NTM present, suggesting a
potential interference of NTM on these read-outs in a diagnostic
setting. TGF-b1 performs many cellular functions and is involved
in wound healing of granulomatous lesions in TB [30]. IL-2
promotes T cell replication and is essential for maintaining

adaptive cellular immunity and granuloma formation [31]. The
cytokine IL-6 is produced by the innate immune cells early
following a pathogen encounter and is implicated in the host
inflammatory response to MTB [27].
In a study from South Africa, NTM were isolated in 6% of all
children investigated for pulmonary TB and association of NTM
isolation with constitutional symptoms was suggestive of host
recognition [14]. In the present study, NTM were isolated in
about a quarter of the infants in this study. This is a relatively high
proportion, but the lack of pathology seen in CXR in children with
NTM present and the lack of associated symptoms suggest no
association with disease. The possibility of laboratory contamina￾tion was considered minimal, due to strict adherence to sampling
and laboratory procedures including internal and external quality
control. Moreover, the present study shows that NTM were less
likely to be isolated from clinical samples at younger ages 0–12
months (adjusted for gender and symptoms; OR 0.18, CI 0.04–
0.79) suggesting a reduced interaction with the environment in
younger children, an unlikely finding if NTM presence was caused
by contamination, since NTM are ubiquitously found in soil and
water. A possible limitation of this study is that we were not able to
determine the background NTM rate in a control group of
children. Children were referred for investigation if they were
considered to be at risk of TB, due to suspected illness or history of
TB contact, thereby introducing an ascertainment bias. This factor
was partly overcome by comparing children with culture￾confirmed NTM or MTB only. Exposure to NTM through the
oral or respiratory route is usually asymptomatic. However, our
study shows that NTM carriage or transient and likely repeated
exposure elicits responses which resemble the response seen in
MTB infection [15,32]. This highlights the importance of
evaluation of TB biomarkers in the context of exposure to NTM.
In conclusion, it is clear that NTM presence modulates host
immunity. Even though NTM exposure rarely causes a symp￾tomatic infection in healthy individuals, this study shows that
NTM carriage or transient and likely repeated exposure does elicit
some of the same immune responses as MTB infection, namely
down-regulation of and up-regulation of TGFb1. In different
settings and populations, these immune biomarkers have shown a
potential as discriminatory diagnostic biomarkers in MTB

infection and disease. Whether these markers hold a potential as
correlates of TB protection remains to be elucidated. Nevertheless,
the results from the present study suggest that NTM presence
should be considered when evaluating future biomarkers for this
purpose, as the presence of NTM may impact the specificity of
immune biomarkers for TB outcomes.
