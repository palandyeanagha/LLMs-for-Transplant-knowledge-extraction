Abstract
Chagas disease (CD) affects over six million people and is a leading cause of cardiomyopa￾thy in Latin America. Given recent migration trends, there is a large population at risk in the
United States (US). Early stage cardiac involvement from CD usually presents with conduc￾tion abnormalities on electrocardiogram (ECG) including right bundle branch block (RBBB),
left anterior or posterior fascicular block (LAFB or LPFB, respectively), and rarely, left bundle
branch block (LBBB). Identification of disease at this stage may lead to early treatment and
potentially delay the progression to impaired systolic function. All ECGs performed in a Los
Angeles County hospital and clinic system were screened for the presence of RBBB, LAFB,
LPFB, or LBBB. Patients were contacted and enrolled in the study if they had previously
resided in Latin America for at least 12 months and had no history of cardiac disease.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence assay (IFA) tests
were utilized to screen for Trypanosoma cruzi seropositivity. A total of 327 consecutive
patients were screened for CD from January 2007 to December 2010. The mean age was
46.3 years and the mean length of stay in the US was 21.2 years. Conduction abnormalities
were as follows: RBBB 40.4%, LAFB 40.1%, LPFB 2.8%, LBBB 5.5%, RBBB and LAFB
8.6%, and RBBB and LPFB 2.8%. Seventeen patients were positive by both ELISA and IFA
(5.2%). The highest prevalence rate was among those with RBBB and LAFB (17.9%).
There is a significant prevalence of CD in Latin American immigrants residing in Los Angeles
with conduction abnormalities on ECG. Clinicians should consider evaluating all Latin Amer￾ican immigrant patients with unexplained conduction disease for CD.

Author Summary
Chagas disease (CD) affects an estimated 300,000 people in the United States, but warning
signs for the disease have not been closely studied. CD is usually acquired in Latin Amer￾ica, and can remain in the body for years or decades without producing any symptoms.
However, in about 30% of patients, it can eventually result in heart failure and death. The
electrocardiogram can detect potential heart problems before patients begin to feel symp￾toms, providing an early warning. If patients with CD receive monitoring and treatment
in time, it may prevent the development of more serious heart problems. We checked for
the presence of CD in a sample of 327 patients with abnormal electrocardiogram readings,
all of whom had resided in Latin America for at least 12 months. Seventeen patients, or
5.2% of the total sample, were positive for CD. Our study discusses the association of dif￾ferent electrocardiogram readings with CD in the United States, and explores variations
based on patients’ gender and country of origin. The electrocardiogram can be a valuable
tool for detecting and measuring the progression of CD in patients from Latin America so
that proper treatment can be offered.
Introduction
Chagas disease (CD), caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is a slow-progressing,
multi-organ disease endemic to Latin America. There are an estimated 6 million infected indi￾viduals worldwide.[1, 2] CD has an acute and chronic phase, with the chronic phase beginning
4–8 weeks after the initial infection.[3] The chronic phase begins in an asymptomatic indeter￾minate form characterized by seropositivity for antibodies against T. cruzi, a normal electro￾cardiogram (ECG), and a normal chest radiograph. Without treatment, at least 30–40% of
patients with the indeterminate form will develop an advanced or determinate form 10–30
years after the initial infection.[3, 4] The advanced chronic form of CD can lead to irreversible
cardiac damage resulting in conduction disease, apical aneurysms, cardiomyopathy, and sud￾den cardiac death. [4]
CD is traditionally associated with endemic regions in Latin America. However, given
migration trends, there has been increasing recognition of populations with CD in Europe and
the United States. A recent meta-analysis of European studies, which in aggregate screened
10,000 Latin American immigrants, found a CD prevalence of 4.2%.[5] Another study estimates
300,000 cases of CD in the US, contributing to 30–45,000 cases of cardiomyopathy.[1] Between
2007 and 2013, 1908 cases of CD were identified in the blood donation system.[6] In a study of
blood samples in Los Angeles, 1 in 1,993 were positive for T.cruzi antibodies.[7] Nonetheless, an
overwhelming majority of CD patients in the US are undiagnosed and untreated.[6, 8]
Conduction disorders are characteristic of chronic determinate Chagas disease, and are
often the initial presenting finding. A study in Bolivia found ECG abnormalities in 46% of
seropositive children, the most frequent being incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB).
[9] Another study in Mexico found that ECG abnormalities including RBBB were significantly
higher among seropositive versus seronegative individuals.[10] In a sample of 1,389 people in
a rural community of Brazil with a T. cruzi prevalence of 6.6%, ECG abnormalities were
observed in 43.5% of seropositive compared with 18.3% of seronegative individuals.[11] Fur￾ther, ECG abnormalities can help identify patients who are at higher risk of developing
impaired systolic function. The presence of ECG abnormalities at baseline was a significant
predictor of decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) after 17 months of follow-up
in a cohort of Brazilian patients.[12]

Conduction abnormalities and cardiomyopathy are also strongly associated with CD in
Latin American immigrants in the United States and Europe. In our center in Los Angeles,
among adult Latin American patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, defined as an LVEF
<40%, we found a CD prevalence of 19.2%.[13] Another study in New York identified five
seropositive cases among 39 immigrants from CD-endemic countries with dilated cardiomy￾opathy, a prevalence of 13%.[14] Among a sample of 17 T. cruzi-positive blood donors in
southeast Texas, 7 (41%) exhibited evidence of cardiomyopathy on electrocardiograph.[15] In
Spain, an investigation of 485 T. cruzi-positive immigrants, of whom 459 (94.6%) were Boliv￾ian, determined 31.5% had at least one ECG abnormality.[16] The purpose of this study is to
assess the prevalence of CD in a population of Latin American immigrants with conduction
abnormalities on electrocardiogram in a Los Angeles County Hospital.
Methods
Olive View-UCLA Medical Center is a 377-bed Los Angeles County Hospital which serves a
population of 2.1 million people within a catchment area of 999 square miles. Forty percent of
this population is Hispanic/Latino. In 2013, nearly 10% of residents earned less than 200% of
the federal poverty level, and 27% of adults (ages 18–64) were uninsured all or part of the year.
[17]
All ECGs performed as part of regular clinical care at Olive View-UCLA Medical Center
and three affiliated clinics between January 2007 and December 2010 were reviewed. This
included ECGs for preoperative or routine examinations and patients who presented with
non-specific clinical complaints such as chest pain, palpitations or shortness of breath. Enroll￾ment criteria were: age 18–60 years old; an ECG with evidence of RBBB, LBBB, LAFB, and/or
LPFB; and history of residence in Latin America for at least 12 months. All ECGs were exam￾ined for evidence of conduction abnormalities and classified by two board-certified cardiolo￾gists blinded to the study, with discrepancies resolved by a third board-certified cardiologist
with consensus opinion. Duration of residency in country of origin and US were determined
by interview/questionnaire. Exclusion criteria were: any known history of cardiac disease,
including coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, or cardiomyopathy, defined as
LVEF 40%.
A total of 399 subjects were identified and met enrollment criteria: 67 subjects could not be
successfully contacted and 5 subjects refused participation, resulting in a final study size of
327. A single 5 mL blood sample was obtained from all patients for T. cruzi serology testing,
and a questionnaire regarding demographic information was completed at the time of study
enrollment. Serological testing was performed through the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC). All samples underwent Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA,
Chagatest ELISA recombinant v. 3.0, Wiener Laboratories, Argentina) and Immunofluores￾cence Assay (IFA). Subjects were considered seropositive for CD only if both assays resulted
positive.
Statistical Analysis
We computed frequencies and proportions for categorical variables, and means and standard
deviations for continuous variables. Chi-square tests for independence or Fisher’s exact tests,
as appropriate, were used to detect associations between categorical variables, and t-tests were
employed for continuous variables. All p values are two-sided, with p < 0.05 considered signif￾icant for all analyses. Analyses were conducted with SPSS software, version 23 (SPSS Inc., Chi￾cago IL).

Seventeen patients were positive for T. cruzi by both IFA and ELISA, resulting in an overall
prevalence rate of 5.2% in this cohort of patients with unexplained conduction disease. These
patients had not been previously diagnosed and were unaware they had CD. In the seropositive
group, the mean age was 50.8±10.7 years with a mean time of residence in country of origin of
28.1±10.0 years. The difference in mean ages (4.8 years) between the seropositive and seroneg￾ative group was not statistically significant at the p<0.05 level (p = 0.08). A much smaller pro￾portion of seropositive patients (n = 5, 29.4%) were male, compared with the seronegative
group (n = 170, 54.8%), and this difference was significant (p = 0.048). The countries of origin
of the seropositive patients were as follows (prevalence within subgroup in parentheses): El Sal￾vador 8 (11.4%), Mexico 5 (2.5%), Guatemala 2 (6.5%), and other 2 (6.9%) (Table 1). There
was substantial variation between countries; the prevalence was significantly lower for Mexi￾cans yet higher for Salvadorans (p = 0.001).
We found the following conduction abnormalities within the seropositive group: RBBB
(n = 7, 41.2%), LAFB (n = 5, 29.4%), and RBBB in conjunction with LAFB (n = 5, 29.4%) (Fig
1, Table 2). No positive patients had LBBB, LPFB, or RBBB and LPFB. We calculated CD prev￾alence according to each type of conduction abnormality. For RBBB, 7/132 patients (5.3%)
were seropositive, for LAFB, 5/131 (3.8%), and for RBBB/LAFB 5/28 (17.9%). The risk for pos￾itive CD diagnosis in patients with both RBBB and LAFB, compared to other conduction
abnormalities in the sample, was five times greater (OR = 5.2, CI = 1.7–16.0, p = 0.002).
Discussion
The majority of previous research investigations on CD-associated ECG findings have focused
on populations residing in Latin America.[9, 11, 18] The prevalence of CD among Latin Amer￾ican immigrants in the U.S. has not been well studied. Based on immigration rates and the
prevalence of T. cruzi infection in countries of origin, the CDC estimated a prevalence of
Fig 1. ECG examples. Panel A shows a normal ECG. Panel B is an ECG from a patient with Chagas
disease; a right bundle branch block is noted in lead V1 (circle) and there is evidence of left axis deviation in
the limb leads (arrows) secondary to a left anterior fascicular block. Taken together, these findings are
consistent with a bifascicular block.

1.31% among Latin immigrants in the U.S.[1] Among a subset of Latin American-born
patients with conduction abnormalities, we found a much higher T. cruzi prevalence of 5.2%.
This group of patients may represent a high-risk group with the presence of early stage cardiac
CD, and may benefit from closer monitoring and treatment.
Conduction abnormalities can serve as markers for early stage cardiac involvement in CD.
[11, 19] Prior research has demonstrated RBBB and LAFB, isolated or in combination, to be
more frequently present in CD.[9, 11] Similarly, our study found the highest prevalence in
those with both RBBB and LAFB (17.9%), followed by RBBB (5.3%) and LAFB (3.8%). As
expected, no patients with LBBB or LPFB had CD. The prevalence of CD among patients with
both RBBB and LAFB approximates that among patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy
in an earlier study at our center.[13]
We found substantial variation by gender and country of origin. Although previous studies
have noted more frequent cardiomyopathy in males with CD,[4] in our sample of patients with
conduction abnormalities, there was a higher proportion of seropositive females. However, this
could be due to other underlying causes for which we did not collect data. The variation in prev￾alence by country of residence has important clinical ramifications. The proportion of CD
among those from El Salvador (11.4%) was more than twice the overall prevalence and over
four times that of patients from Mexico. The WHO estimates a prevalence of CD of 1.3% in El
Salvador,[2] but other evidence suggests active transmission is still disproportionately affecting
some areas of the country.[20] Further, while the prevalence among Mexican patients was com￾paratively low in our study (2.5%), it still greatly exceeds the national prevalence estimate of
0.78.[2]
Ideally, patients born in Latin America would receive screening for presence of T. cruzi
antibodies in primary care; confirmed positive cases should also undergo an ECG and other
diagnostic tests to assess cardiac involvement. However, because up to 99% of people with CD
are undiagnosed and T. cruzi infection is not routinely screened in the U.S. outside of blood
banks,[6] it is likely many at-risk patients who present with ECG abnormalities within the
medical system have not had a prior test for CD. When patients from endemic countries show
ECG abnormalities characteristic of CD, it is essential to ensure they have been tested for T.
cruzi antibodies so that this diagnosis can either be ruled out or utilized to inform subsequent
treatment. In this study, one in five patients with bifascicular block (RBBB and LAFB) had T.
cruzi infection.
Conduction abnormalities can serve as predictors of impaired systolic function in Chagas
patients.[12, 18] Given the potential benefits of antiparasitic therapy at an earlier stage of CD,
[21] timely identification of conduction abnormalities are an important criterion in assessing
the urgency of providing treatment. Although the BENEFIT trial did not identify an advantage
for antitrypanosomal therapy for patients who already had developed moderate to severely
impaired systolic function, the study had a short follow-up period (5 years) and exhibited con￾siderable intercountry variation in outcomes, which may reflect differences in T. cruzi strains.
[22] The lack of advantage to treating patients with preexisting impaired systolic function in
the BENEFIT trial underscores the importance of considering antitrypanosmal therapy before
patients progress to the advanced form of chronic Chagas disease, especially since parasite per￾sistence is a potential trigger of cardiac damage. [4, 23] In an Argentinian study with 21 years
of follow-up, patients who received treatment with benznidazole were less likely to progress to
a more severe Kuschnir classification compared to placebo.[21] Treatment with benznidazole
may thus be a viable option for patients who exhibit RBBB or other conduction abnormalities
yet no other signs of cardiomyopathy.
To our knowledge, no other study has retrospectively evaluated the prevalence of CD in
patients with conduction abnormalities on ECG in the U.S. Our data demonstrate a significant

presence of CD in this population, which is substantially higher than the proportion detected
through blood sample surveillance. The presence of bifascicular block (RBBB and LAFB) and
history of residence in El Salvador appear to be additional risk factors. Awareness of these
potential risk factors can help focus screening to identify patients within the U.S. health system
who have undiagnosed CD, so that proper treatment can be provided.
Limitations
We did not account for potentially confounding factors such as age, diabetes mellitus, or
hypertension in our analyses. The subgroup of seropositive patients was small, creating wide
confidence intervals in the calculation of risk factors. Exclusion of patients with underlying
cardiac disease could possibly lead to an underestimation of prevalence of CD. This study is
based on a sample of patients from a Los Angeles County public hospital system; the results
may not be generalizable to other locations.
