Abstract
Background: We hypothesize that implantation of left ventricular assist device through off-pump technique is
feasible and has a comparable result to implantation on cardiopulmonary bypass and could improve one-year
survival.
Methods: This retrospective, observational, single-center study was conducted on 29 consecutive patients at our
institution who underwent off-pump left ventricular assist device implantation by a single surgeon.
Results: Twenty-seven procedures were performed successfully using the off-pump technique. The survival rate
was 92% at 30 days, 76% at 90 days, and 67% at one year. We compared the one-year survival of different
implantation periods, and divided our study into three time intervals (2004-2005, 2006, and 2007). There was a
trend in reduction in number of deaths over one year that demonstrated a decrease in death rate from 50% to
17%, as well as improvement in our experience over time. However, this trend is not statistically significant (p =
0.08) due to limited sample size.
Conclusions: Based upon our findings, off-pump left ventricular assist device implantation is a feasible surgical
technique, and combining this technique with improved device technology in the future may provide even
greater improvement in patient outcomes.
Background
Left ventricular assist devices were approved as a bridge to
transplantation therapy (BTT) in 1998 [1]. In 2001, they
became a destination therapy in the United States [2].
Perioperative complications result from a combination of
three factors: 1) intrinsic heart failure with secondary
organ damage; 2) long-term effect of the implanted device;
and 3) surgical techniques employed, including cardiopul￾monary bypass (CPB). CPB has advantages such as
inspecting left ventricle for thrombus, hemodynamic
resuscitation, and removing fluid, including ultrafiltrations
on CPB, but it may have unwanted effects as well, such as
increasing systemic inflammatory response and transfu￾sion requirements. To date, the experimental and clinical
data comparing on-pump and off-pump coronary surgery
suggest an affected cardiac function in favor of off-pump
operations, which might be related to greater myocardial
damage during hypothermic CPB operations [3]. We
believe in order to improve the clinical outcome there is a
need to ameliorate one of these factors. Although previous
studies have demonstrated an advantage in reducing mor￾bidity in off-pump coronary artery bypass-graft (CABG)
patients, but not reducing mortality, it can be reasonably
concluded that the same may hold true in sicker patients
receiving off-pump left ventricular assist device (OP
LVAD) implantation in high-risk heart failure patients
[4,5]. This article analyzes our experience with the initial
series of 29 consecutive patients undergoing placement of
LVAD as both BTT and destination therapy, without the
use of CPB, and measures postoperative mortality up to
one year.
Methods
After obtaining approval from the Institutional Review
Board, we retrospectively reviewed data from patients
who were scheduled to undergo OP LVAD implantation

at The Ohio State University Medical Center between
October 2004 and May 2007. Postoperative outcomes
included ventilation hours and postoperative hospital
stays (days). Mean and standard deviation were calcu￾lated [5]. Early postoperative bleeding was in accordance
with Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Cir￾culatory Support (INTERMACS) guidelines to ensure
that the descriptions of adverse events in studies using
mechanical assist devices are universal. The types of
implanted devices included: 14 HeartMate II, 10 Heart￾Mate XVE, 2 IVAD, and 1 DeBakey. The incidence rates
of complications were calculated. Patient mortality was
calculated at three time periods: 30 days, 90 days, and
one year postoperatively. We performed a univariate
analysis of all patient data to obtain descriptive statistics.
Comparisons across categories were performed through
Fisher’s exact test.
Anesthetic Technique
We reviewed the intraoperative anesthetic chart in all
study patients, which included the monitoring of arterial
blood pressure, heart rate, pulmonary artery pressure,
and central venous pressure. An intraoperative transeso￾phageal echocardiogram was employed for assessment
of right and left ventricular function, exclusion of
associated pathologies that preclude OP implantation
(intra-atrial shunts, ventricular thrombus, severe aortic
insufficiency), and guidance in de-airing of the heart
once the device was implanted. Heparin was adminis￾tered to keep the kaolin activated clotting time (ACT)
above 300 seconds. Inotropic medications were used to
support right ventricular function according to the treat￾ing anesthesiologist. There was no point of care testing
for transfusion requirements, which were determined by
the treating physicians. The treating physician made
clinical decisions about the transfusion of PRBCs or
other blood products without clear logarithms.
Surgical Technique
A detailed surgical technique of OP LVAD implantation
was first perfected after more than 30 intracorporeal
ventricular assist devices were implanted off pump in
bovine and ovine models for various studies including
heart failure (unpublished data) due to the time- and
cost-intensive nature of placing animals on CPB [6].
Our team’s experience with this novel idea was then
translated to our patients. Before starting the procedure,
we performed transesophageal echocardiography
to monitor underlying contraindications to OP LVAD
implantation, such as severe aortic regurgitation, right￾to-left shunts with worsening hypoxemia, and/or throm￾bus formation. Also, a primed bypass circuit was avail￾able in case of an emergent change to an on-pump
procedure, such as hemodynamic instability. After
median sternotomy, a pericardial well was created and a
pre-peritoneal pocket formed by tunneling the driveline
through the skin, with placement of the device in the
pocket. After successful heparinization (ACT of 300 sec￾onds), the ascending aorta was cannulated with an
Embol-X cannula to collect debris, while the outflow
graft was sewn into the ascending aorta in the standard
fashion with a partial cross clamp. Opening of the infer￾ior right pericardial edge to the inferior vena cava, with
release of stay sutures, allowed cardiac positioning with
the apex out of the chest as in an off-pump CABG pro￾cedure. Meanwhile, the patient was placed in the Tren￾delenburg position, slightly rotated towards the surgeon.
An apical sewing cuff was sewn into the left ventricular
apex by passing a large silk stitch into the center of the
apex, while 2-0 pledgetted Ticron mattress sutures were
placed in the apex and passed through the cuff. Three
large Foley catheters were prepared and ready for use.
The first was moistened and passed into the inflow
elbow of the ventricular assist device, positioned so the
tip exits the proximal end of the cannula. Next it was
inflated with 10 to 15 ml of saline to plug the lumen of
the cannula, while the proximal end of the Foley was
clamped to stop back bleeding. The second Foley cathe￾ter was prepared similarly and used to help core the LV
apex, making sure it was inflated and deflated while still
providing occlusion of the lumen. The final Foley cathe￾ter was prepared similarly and used in case of rupture
of one of the first two Foley balloons. The outflow graft
was then attached to the LVAD and back bled to help
de-air the pump. The apex was then cored with a coring
knife that was passed through the Foley and silk stay
suture. An incision was made into the LV apex and the
Foley was placed into the cavity. The second Foley was
inflated with 15 ml of saline and traction applied to
bring the apex up and out of the chest cavity. The apex
was cored without entering the Foley, and scissors were
used to remove the remaining cuff. After coring the
apex, the inflow elbow was connected by deflating and
removing the balloon. To minimize ejection of blood
out of the hole during balloon removal and inflow graft
connection, the heart was arrested for 1 to 2 minutes
with adenosine intravenous bolus (6 to 12 mg IV) or
fibrillated using DC fibrillator (Cardiovascular Instru￾ment Corp., Model 2039, Wakefield, MA, USA). A lin￾ear incision was made through the diaphragm, allowing
the pump to sit in the preperitoneal space and then the
diaphragm was closed around the inflow cannula, while
the pump was back bled again from the aortic side for
de-airing.
Results
The patients’ baseline characteristics were measured in
the intensive care unit prior to coming to the operating

room (Table 1). The average patient age was approxi￾mately 50 years old and about two-thirds were male.
Dilated cardiomyopathy was the most common etiology
of heart failure and the average ejection fraction was
approximately 15%. Of the 29 cases scheduled for OP
LVAD, 27 cases were successfully performed with
18 patients as BTT and 7 as destination therapy. In one
of the failed cases, the surgeon entered the right atrium
during resternotomy. The second was a congenital
patient with a previous Mustard operation who did not
tolerate partial occlusion of the systemic great vessel.
Both patients had successful implants with CPB.
Statistical analysis was performed on 27 patients. Of
those analyzed, 4 patients presented with cardiogenic
shock. No patients required unplanned right VAD pla￾cement. Subsequently, 5 patients had a cardiac trans￾plantation. Of these 5 patients, 2 had a heart transplant
1 year after LVAD insertion; 1 patient was transplanted
2 months after the LVAD placement and died 8 months
posttransplant from graft rejection; and the other 2
patients underwent heart transplants 2 and 5 months
after LVAD implantation. We excluded those 3 patients
who received transplants after less than one year when
calculating the mortality. Two patients categorized as
destination therapy became transplant eligible.
Eight of 27 patients experienced postoperative bleed￾ing, which required a transfusion of more than 4 units
of PRBCs for an overall incidence of 30%. One patient
returned to the operating room for re-exploration due
to excessive bleeding. Postoperative results are presented
in Table 2. The mean of postoperative hospital stays was
28 days with a standard deviation of 19. The average
ventilation hour was 66 with a standard deviation of 93.
There was no incidence of infection reported. There was
1 incidence of stroke, 6 of renal failure, 8 of respiratory
failure, and 4 reintubations out of 27 operations. Causes
of death in one year included sepsis with multi-organ
failure (n = 6), coagulopathy with bowel necrosis (n =
1), and respiratory distress with right heart failure (n =
1). The percent of survival was 93% at 30 days, 76% at
90 days, and 67% at one year. According to a recent
study on LVAD [6], the estimates of one-year survival
rates were 68% for the continuous-flow LVAD and 55%
for the pulsatile-flow LVAD. Our study showed similar
one-year survival rates with continuous-flow LVAD and
was better than the pulsatile-flow LVAD.
To investigate whether our OP LVAD technique
improved over time, we compared the mortality rates of
different implantation periods (Table 3). We divided the
total study into three time intervals (2004-2005, 2006,
and 2007). The death rate during this time decreased
from 50% to 17%. Even though the trend was not statis￾tically significant (p = 0.08, Fisher’s exact test), we
believe the limited sample size played a role. It will be
promising and worthwhile to validate this trend in a
large clinical trial and/or a multi-center study.

Discussion
This study reports the feasibility of a surgical technique
for placement of LVADs through a median sternotomy
incision without the use of CPB at our institution. This
technique was used in the implantation of several differ￾ent LVAD devices and was successful in 27 of 29 conse￾cutive patients. Our initial anesthetic learning experience
with OP LVAD insertion was satisfactory. Our one-year
survival of OP LVAD insertion was 67%, which proved
better than the Randomized Evaluation of Mechanical
Assistance for the Treatment of Congestive Heart Failure
(REMATCH) trial (52%) and the post-REMATCH era
(56%). We believe this may be related to the avoidance of
CPB, although this hypothesis has yet to be proven [2,4].
This was also comparable to the one-year survival of the
most recent large trial using continuous-flow LVAD
(68%), and better than pulsatile flow LVAD (52%), both
on CPB [7]. However, our results were slightly less
favorable compared with the one-year survival (73%)
seen in recent trials conducted by Pagani et. al, using
continuous-flow rotary LVAD using CPB in BTT
patients, which correlated consistent improvements in
patient outcome with newer device technology [8]. How￾ever, we believe that avoidance of CPB combined with
improvements in device technology could provide greater
benefits in future clinical outcomes.
In our series of 27 OP LVAD insertions, 9 patients
experienced postoperative bleeding leading to transfusion
of more than 4 units of PRBCs in the first 24 hours, a
rate better than the historical REMATCH trial group
(38%) in which all procedures were performed using
CPB. In another study, using the same definition for mas￾sive perioperative bleeding as the INTERMACS registry
and our study, which evaluated 222 patients with a Nova￾cor LVAD implanted during CPB, massive perioperative
bleeding occurred in 97 out of 222 patients and half of
the total population returned for reoperation [9,10]. We
believe this may be related to CPB and its deleterious
effect and/or the Novacor device. However, this claim
warrants further investigation in a randomized control
trial with newer technology like the HeartMate II LVAD,
which has different characteristics of flow.
Despite our initial encouraging results, this study has a
number of limitations. While it does represent a conse￾cutive series of patients who underwent the same surgi￾cal technique, it is a retrospective study that consists of
a limited number of subjects and the hypothesis was
generated after the surgical technique was established.
In addition, due to the retrospective nature of the data
collection, the transfusion trigger was not standardized
within the first 24 hours postoperatively. Lastly, we
could not do a case match control group from historical
data in our institution for two reasons: 1) there was an
upgrade in device technology, and 2) all of these cases
were performed by one surgeon, who was using only
this technique in 27 consecutive patients, and the histor￾ical group cases were performed by different surgeons
on the CPB.
Conclusions
As we performed more procedures off pump, the perio￾perative team became more familiar with the surgical
technique and anesthetic requirement, and this was
reflected in our data, showing improvement over time
in one-year survival post implantation. The death rate
over one year decreased from 50% to 17% in our small
series, although this trend was not statistically significant
due to limitations in sample size; however, many events
including postoperative care, etc. can affect the one year
outcome. It did show promise in helping high-risk
heart failure patients, and the next step is to perform
this technique in a larger clinical trial to validate this

LVAD insertion with reduced postoperative mortality rate. The trend is not

hypothesis, which we believe is worthwhile in improving
clinical outcomes of cases done off CPB. This would
allow confirmation of our findings, while addressing the
limitations of our retrospective analysis. In conclusion,
based upon our findings, OP LVAD implantation is a
feasible surgical technique, and combining this techni￾que with improved device technology could provide
even greater improvement in patient outcomes in the
future.
