INTRODUCTION 
Although the “do no harm” dogma of Hippocrates is faithfully followed 
by all practitioners, drugs used for therapeutic interventions either alone or in 
combination, may sometimes cause unexpected toxicity to the muscles, 
resulting in a varying degree of symptomatology, from mild discomfort and 
inconvenience to permanent damage and disability. The clinician should 
suspect a toxic myopathy when a patient without a pre-existing muscle 
disease develops myalgia, fatigue, weakness, or myoglobinuria, temporally 
connected to the administration of a drug or exposure to a myotoxic 
substance. Myotoxic agents can cause a myopathy by: a) directly affecting a 
muscle organelle, such as mitochondria, lysosomes, myofibrillar proteins; b) 
altering muscle antigens, thereby inducing an immunologic or inflammatory 
reaction; and c) inducing systemic effects, such as electrolyte disturbances, 
nutritional deprivation or malabsorption, which secondarily affect the muscle 
function. 
The review provides an update on the drugs with well documented 
myocytoxicity and cautions the clinicians to be alert for the potential toxicity of 
newly marketed drugs; highlights the clinical features and pathomechanisms 
of the induced muscle disease; and offers guidance on how best to treat and 
distinguish toxic myopathies from other acquired or hereditary muscle 
disorders. Myotoxicity resulting from direct insertion of transgenes to the 
muscle, an exciting new tool currently tested for treatment of muscular 
dystrophies, will be also discussed.

PRINCIPLES OF DRUG-RELATED MYOCYTOTOXICITY 
Although FDA encourages physicians to file a report via MedWatch 
when a drug reaction is suspected, only the serious drug-related 
myocytotoxicities, such as myoglobinuria, are usually reported. Mild 
symptoms, such as myalgia or fatigue, are rarely reported during the post￾marketing period. As a result, the true incidence or the frequency of drug￾induced myocytotoxicities remains unclear. Furthermore, the data available 
prior to marketing are limited to monotherapies in a small patient population 
without taking into account the interactions with other drugs, as seen in 
practice. 
A drug-induced myopathy is defined as the subacute, and rarely acute, 
manifestation of myopathic symptoms, such as muscle weakness, fatigue, 
myalgia, CK elevation or myoglobinuria, that occur in patients without muscle 
disease when exposed to therapeutic doses of certain drugs. After 
discontinuation of the suspected agent, the clinical or biochemical signs of 
muscle involvement usually improve supporting the causative effect of the 
offending myotoxic drug. Sometimes however, the toxicity is irreversible, as 
we have witnessed with the drug Fialuridine, a nucleoside analogue that 
caused irreversible myocytotoxicity by incorporating into the mitDNA chain, as 
discussed later. The muscle biopsy is essential to document myotoxicity, but 
at times it may be uninformative, as occurs in some patients with 
myoglobinuria or mild muscle weakness caused by statins or nucleoside 
analogues. 
The type of histological abnormalities seen in toxic myopathies varies 
from non- specific alterations to a distinctive necrotizing, inflammatory or 
vacuolar myopathy. Because toxic myopathies are potentially reversible, 
prompt diagnosis and pharmacovigilence are needed to institute early 
therapy, prevent irreversible changes and protect other patients from similar 
toxicity. 
CLINICAL AND HISTOLOGICAL SPECTRUM OF TOXIC MYOPATHIES 
The clinical manifestations are variable and include myalgia, 
hyperCKemia, muscle weakness or myoglobinuria. According to the type of 
injury induced to the muscle fiber or specific organelle, the toxic myopathies 
can be classified as follows [1-5] (Table1): 
a) Necrotizing myopathy. This is histologically defined by the presence 
of scattered necrotic fibers invaded by macrophages. There is absence of 
widespread MHC-I upregulation or a large number of lymphocytic infiltrates 
invading non-necrotic fibers, as seen in inflammatory myopathies. Generically, 
it is the most typical toxic effect to the muscle; 
b) Inflammatory myopathy. It has the features similar to those seen in 
polymyositis, including CD8+ T cells invading non-necrotic, MHC-I -
expressing fibers. It can be caused by statins, D-penicillamine, or 
intramuscular injections of genes.

c) Thick filament loss myopathy. This is the prototypic cause of muscle 
weakness seen in ICU. It is also caused by steroids in a setting of acute 
denervation or in combination with neuromuscular blocking agents; 
d) Type II muscle fiber atrophy. It is caused by many conditions but the 
primary cause is long-term steroid use combined with inactivity; 
e) Mitochondrial myopathy. This is histologically characterised by the 
presence of “ragged red” or “ragged blue” fibers, COX-negative fibers and 
increased lipid accumulation. It is typically seen with nucleoside analogues; 
 f) Lysosomal storage myopathy. This is typically caused by amphiphilic 
drugs, which contain a hydrophobic region that interacts with acidic 
phospholipids of membranes, generating the storage of myeloid structures 
within the lysosomes in the form of autophagic vacuoles [1-3]. Chlorochine is 
the main drug in this group; 
g) Anti-microtubule myopathy. The classic example in this group is 
colchicine, which inhibits the polymerization of microtubules resulting in 
disruption of cytoskeletal network with swollen lysosomes and autophagic 
vacuoles [6]; 
h) Myofibrillar myopathy. The representative drug in this group is 
emetin which causes disruption of the Z discs followed by breakdown of 
myofilaments and accumulation of myofibrillar proteins [1-5, 7]; and 
 i) Fasciitis. This is histologically characterized by inflammation and 
thickening of the myofascia. Clinically, it causes muscle pain and induration. 
Toxic oil syndrome and contaminated L-tryptophan have been the main 
causative agents. 
The drugs clearly implicated in causing a toxic myopathy are listed in 
Table 2. As new drugs become available, it is very likely that the list will 
increase, necessitating the need for pharmacovigilence. It should be noted 
that a number of drugs such as statins, colchicine, L-tryptophan, can cause 
both, a myopathy and a neuropathy which enhances further the toxicity to the 
neuromuscular system. Drugs that cause only neuropathy, but rarely a 
myopathy as monotherapy, such as ddC, ddI, d4T, perhexiline, amiodarone, 
vincristine, gold sodium thiomalate, and TNF-α inhibitors, will not be 
discussed as being beyond the scope of this review. 
COMMON DRUGS INDUCING MUSCLE TOXICITY 
1. ANTI-CHOLESTEROL: STATIN-INDUCED MYOPATHIES 
Statins is a group of fungus-derived drugs that inhibit the 3-hydroxy-3-
methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, an enzyme that catalyzes 
the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid, the precursor of cholesterol 
[8-10]. The statins, according to the degree of myotoxicity they induce, include 
sequentially the following: cerivastatin (now withdrawn), simvastatin, 
lovostatin, pravastatin, atorvastatin and fluvastatin [10-11]. These drugs are 
multipotent, “wonder drugs”, because in addition to lowering the cholesterol, 
they have immunomodulating properties and neuroprotective actions. 
Experimentally, statins affect the mitochondria and the sarcoplasmic reticulum 
especially in the type II fibers which contain 30% less fat than the type I fibers, 
rendering them more vulnerable to damage caused by a reduction in 

4
cholesterol available for membrane biosynthesis [12]. Dysfunction of 
mitochondria has been shown in muscle biopsies of patients with statin￾induced myopathic symptoms. Further, after treatment with statins and low fat 
diet, there is an up to 54% reduction of serum ubiqninone, a co-enzyme Q10 
that participates in electron transport during oxidative phosphorylation [13]. 
About 50% of the body’s ubiqninone is obtained through fat ingestion, while 
the other 50% from endogenous synthesis [10, 13]. Reduction of LDL is 
probably a contributing factor since ubiqninone is transported in the LDL 
particles. As a result, two trials have been already conducted using 
ubiqninone to treat statin-induced myopathy, as discussed later. 
Apart from participating in mitochondrial toxicity, statins induce shifting 
of Th1 to Th2 responses, leading to changes in regulatory T cells, B cell 
reactivity and production of autoantibodies [14]. Further, they may inhibit LFA￾I function on endothelial cell wall inhibiting T cell transmigration [15]. 
Based on our experience with patients referred to us for statin-related 
myopathies and review of the literature, the following types of myopathic 
symptoms and signs can be distinguished after treatment with statins: 
a. HyperCKemia in asymptomatic patients 
 In some patients, on routine testing there may be elevation of CK that 
does not exceed 5-6 times the ULN, rarely reaching up to 10 times the ULN. 
These patients have normal strength and no complaints of fatigue or muscle 
pain. Because CK elevation is always associated with elevation of SGOT, 
SGPT or γ-GT, the erroneous impression of liver toxicity is suspected. The CK 
usually fluctuates, reaching the highest levels after exercise. We usually 
manage these patients by follow-up clinical and biochemical examinations. In 
our experience, the CK stabilizes to a lower level, up to 3 times, above the 
ULN. In a few patients that we have biopsied because the CK remained high, 
we have noted either no abnormalities or mild, non-specific, changes 
including an occasional “ragged-red”, or necrotic fiber. 
It is unclear how common is such asymptomatic hyperCKemia, but 
some estimates suggest up to 5% of all treated patients [10]. Whether it is 
prudent to discontinue statins in such patients, especially before excessive 
physical tasks, such as marathon running or weight lifting, remains a matter of 
debate. In our experience, such elevations are inconsequential if the patients 
are asymptomatic and their CK elevation is less than 10 times the ULN. 
b. Myalgia with or without hyperCKemia 
 Myalgia has been reported to occur in up to 9-25% of statin-treated 
patients [10, 11]. Most times, the CK is normal but at times there is 
hyperCKemia up to the levels reported above. The strength is normal. In 
these patients, myalgia usually improves after discontinuation of the drug. If 
the muscle strength is normal and the myalgia is tolerable, we observe the 
patients for 2-3 months before performing a diagnostic biopsy or changing the 
statin to another one. In a few muscle specimens we have examined, the 
changes are minimal and non-specific with an occasional necrotic or “ragged￾red” fiber. 
c. Muscle weakness with CK elevation 
 These patients are the least common but represent the largest group in 
our practice because clinically they have a myopathy and need diagnostic 

5
work-up. In some of our patients the myopathy is mild, subacute and 
temporally related to the initiation of statin therapy; in some others however, 
the myopathy is more chronic without a clear cause-and effect relationship, 
raising the suspicion that the statin might not have been the culprit in inducing 
it, but rather in unravelling a pre-existing muscle condition. Muscle biopsies 
may show a few necrotic fibers without inflammation. At times, however, there 
may be scattered inflammatory autoinvasive T cells and upregulation of MHC￾I, suggestive of an immune-related inflammatory process similar to 
polymyositis. Such patients require immunotherapy. We have been 3 such 
patients and have followed up one who responded to steroids or IVIg. Cases 
of statin-induced PM and DM have been reported by others [16]. 
On the other hand, in patients who present with a more indolent and 
severe chronic myopathic process, statins might have been coincidental to the 
cause of the myopathy. We have seen patients with IBM who thought to have 
good strength prior to statins and sought medical advice because of CK 
elevation. These patients continued to worsen even after stopping the statin 
and, retrospectively, admit that their weakness had probably preceded statin 
administration. Whether statins can worsen a pre-existing myopathic condition 
and facilitate the unravelling of a full-blown immune-mediated or toxic 
myopathy remains an undocumented possibility. We have seen a large 
number of IBM or ALS patients who take statins without any overt signs of 
added muscle toxicity. In patients with pre-existing myopathy who have 
discontinued statin fearing worsening of their condition, we recommend 
resumption of therapy if it is essential for their cardiovascular health. 
d. Rhabdomyolysis 
This is a potentially serious but rare event. It is defined as an acute 
elevation of CK (>15.000 ULN ) often accompanied by myalgia, weakness 
and myoglobinuria. Its reported incidence varies, from 0 for fluvarastatin, 0,04 
for pravastatin and atrovarstatin, 0,19 for lovostatin and as high as 3,16 for 
cervistatin (which has been now removed from the market) [10]. FDA data 
estimate the incidence of rhabdomyolysis similar for all statins (except of the 
cervistatin) when used as monotherapy, and much lower than 1 per 100.000 
prescriptions [17]. The incidence of rhabdomyolysis is increased however 
when statins are combined with other drugs. Most notable among them is 
simvastatin when combined with amiodarone (FDA warning posted 8/8/2008), 
gemfibrozil or cyclosporine [5, 10, 11, 18]. The risk is also dose-related 
occurring when simvastatin is given at doses greater than 20 mg per day. 
Overall, of the 601 cases submitted to the FDA between Nov 1997- March 
2000, 55% of the incidents were due to combinations with gemfibrozil (16%), 
fibrates (13%), cyclosporine (8%), macrolide antibiotics (7%), warfarin (5%), 
digoxin (4%) and azole antifungus (2%) [10, 18]. 
The mechanism of muscle injury through these drug interactions is 
probably the affect on cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 3A4 system. Statins are 
metabolized to a varying degree by CYP 3A4, except probably of pravastatin 
which is cleared by the kidneys [10]. The concomitant medications mentioned 
above inhibit CYP3A4, increasing thereby the concentration of statins. Other 
mechanisms may be also implicated [10]. The risk of rhabdomyolysis can be 
exacerbated by several other factors including compromised hepatic and liver 
function, hypothyroidism and diabetes [10]. The possibility that statins have 

6
unmasked a presymptomatic metabolic myopathy, which was responsible for 
the rhabdomyolysis, or the event was coincidental, should be always kept in 
mind. There are reports of acid maltase deficiency or genetic risk factors for 
metabolic muscle defects in some of the reported cases of rhabdomyolysis, 
including heterozygocity for disease-causing mutations, such as myodenylate, 
CPT deficiency and McArdle disease [5, 19]. There is strong evidence of a 
genetic predisposition to statin myopathy tightly linked to SLCO1B gene that 
encodes an organic anion transporter [20]. 
Rhabdomyolysis is a medical emergency that requires immediate 
discontinuation of drugs and admission to ICU for hydration and electrolyte 
control. Because these drugs need to be combined with others in several 
settings (for example statins with fibrate or niacin in patients with very high 
level of LDL-C, statins with cyclosporine in transplant recipients, statins with 
antiretrovirals in HIV-positive patients) [10], the doctors should be aware of 
the increased risks and monitor the patients very closely. Atorvastatin and 
pravastatin appear to be the most preferable statin in these circumstances 
because of the lower incidence of rhabdomyolysis [10]. 
e. Peripheral Neuropathy 
Symptoms of small-fiber sensory neuropathy develop in a small 
number of patients, about 2-3 months after starting therapy [21]. Neuropathy 
is rare, with figures quoting an incidence of 12 per 100.000 person-years and 
prevelance of 60 per 100.000 persons. We have seen four cases of 
neuropathy induced by statins. The patients reported a “coasting affect” 
(temporary worsening after stopping the drug), with subsequent improvement, 
but not complete resolution of painful dysesthesias. We manage the patients 
symptomatically (Neurontin, Lyrika) and in some we have cautiously tried to 
re-introduce another statin. 
Treatment of statin-induced myopathic symptoms 
The relationship with reduced CoQ10 described above, makes it 
reasonable to use this coenzyme for the treatment of myopathic symptoms. In 
one controlled trial, CoQ10 (100 mg /day) showed significant improvement of 
pain and daily activities, but not of the CK elevation, compared to controls 
who received Vit E [22]. Another study however, showed no benefit of 200 
mg daily [5]. Both of these studies were under-dosed and underpowered. In 
patients with hyperCKemia or features of necrotizing myopathy we usually 
prescribe, empirically, high doses of CoQ10, up to 600-800 mg daily. In 
patients with statin-induced inflammatory myositis, we administer steroids or 
IVIg. 
Prevention of statin myopathy may be accomplished when one 
anticipates drug interactions. At the more global level however, 
pharmacogenomics may become useful in the future, if practical issues of 
routine testing for SLCO1B1 variants are overcome. Since 60% of the patients 
with simvastatin myopathy were attributed to variant SLCO1B1 [20], it is very 
likely that checking for homozygosity for the risk allele, could significantly 
reduce the incidence of myocytotoxicity. 
 Reports questioning the safe use of statins in myasthenia gravis are of 
interest [23]. In one report, 6 of 54 patients (11%) experienced worsening of 
MG symptoms during the first 8 weeks after starting therapy, with higher level 
of AChR antibodies in two of them; three of these patients improved after 
discontinuation of statin. In rare cases, initiation of statin therapy has either 

7
unmasked pre-existing MG or worsened it. The neurologist should be aware 
of such a possibility but the evidence of toxicity remains still weak. This author 
has not witnessed such a worsening in more than 20 MG patients who take 
statins for increased cholesterol after steroid use. Whether the concomitant 
use of steroids prevented such a theoretical worsening, remains unclear. 
2. ANTI-RHEUMATIC, ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AND 
IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE DRUG-INDUCED MYOPATHY
a) D-penicillamine 
 This is the best known drug responsible for immune-mediated 
neuromuscular complications including polymyositis and myasthenia. The 
incidence of PM and DM induced by D-penicillamine is about 0.6% [1-5]. 
Myositis improves afters the drug is discontinued but some times 
immunosuppressants are required. It is very likely that patients with alleles 
predisposing to the development of PM and DM are more susceptible to 
developing these rare complications. 
b) Chloroquine and Hydroxychlorquine 
The antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychlorquine, often used 
by rheumatologists can cause macular and corneal degeneration, peripheral 
neuropathy, and myopathy. The myopathy is seen with long-term 
administration of high doses of chloroquine (500 mg daily) [14]. At times, it 
may be associated with sensory neuropathy. Clinically and histologically, this 
myopathy resembles acid maltase deficiency. It is characterised by muscle 
weakness with often normal CK level, an observation that should be kept in 
mind by the clinicians. Respiratory muscles may be also affected. The 
histological features resemble those occurring with acid maltase deficiency 
namely, multiple vacuoles with acid phosphatase-positive material, myeloid 
bodies within the vacuoles, and enlarged lysosomes with increased lysosomal 
enzyme activity [7]. The myopathy is slowly reversible upon drug 
discontinuation. 
c) Colchicine Myopathy 
Colchicine interferes with the growth of microtubules, thereby affecting 
mitosis by interacting with tubulin and inhibiting the polymerization of 
microtubules [1, 3, 6]. After long-term use, colchicine causes a vacuolar 
myopathy with accumulation of lysosomes and autophagic vacuoles, as well 
as an axonal neuropathy [6]. Patients who are between 50 and 70 years of 
age and who have gout and a mild, chronic, renal insufficiency or take 
nephrotoxic drugs, such as cyclosporine, are predominately affected. 
Symptoms include proximal muscle weakness, elevation of the serum CK 
level, distal sensory involvement, and areflexia. Symptoms resolve 4 to 6 
weeks after discontinuance of the drug. 
d) Interferon-α
 The drug used for chronic active hepatitis can cause autoimmune 
phenomena after long term use, including polymyositis and myasthenia. In our 
experience most patients have a chronic-fatigue-like symptomatology that 
may improve with low-dose prednisone. Cases with documented myositis 
however, have been reported [1]. Symptoms improve after discontinuation of 
the drug. 
e) Cyclosporine and Tacrolimus 

8
 In our experience, these drugs rarely cause myopathy by themselves 
but they are implicated in myotoxicity when used concurrently with statins or 
colchicine. 
 f) Corticosteroids 
Patients with hyperadrenocorticolism (i.e., Cushing syndrome) can 
develop weakness. Similar phenomena can occur during chronic 
administration of prednisone (usually at dosages greater than 20 mg daily) or 
dexamethasone [2]. The latter, may cause weakness within 15 days when 
administered to cancer patients at high cumulative doses between 186-1896 
mg [1]. The steroid-induced myopathic weakness is generally mild, spares the 
neck flexor muscles, and may theoretically aggravate the weakness caused 
by the underlying immune disease or malignancy. Lowering the steroid dose 
reverses the myopathic weakness. The serum CK level is normal, and EMG is 
not informative. 
Steroids do not actually cause a true myopathy, hence the normal CK 
and EMG, but only atrophy of type II fibers “steroid-atrophy” (Figure). The 
term “steroid-myopathy” is therefore a misnomer. Dexamethasome in cancer 
patients is more likely to cause weakness probably due to a compounding 
effect on type II fiber by steroids and the remote effects of cancer. 
Acute quadriplegic myopathy in the form of critical illness can been 
seen in mechanically ventilated patients receiving high doses of 
corticosteroids, especially for asthmatic disorders, in combination with 
depolarizing agents such as pancuronium [2,24]. These patients have 
histological features identical to critical illness, myopathy, characterized by 
selective loss of thick filaments [24]. Rats treated with high-dose-steroids 
develop the same clinicopathologic features if their muscles are acutely 
denervated, confirming the toxic effect of steroid in the exposed muscle 
membrane [25]. We have seen such acute paralysis paradoxically in rare 
patients with myasthenia gravis whose muscles are theoretically in a 
functionally state of denervation from the circulating AChR antibodies. The 
disease is reversible with aggressive mobilization and discontinuation of 
steroids. 
3) ANTI-NUCLEOSIDE ANALOGUES 
Patients treated with the nucleoside analogue Reverse Transcriptase 
Inhibitors (NRTIs), develop a varying degree of myopathy or neuropathy after 
long-term therapy. Zidovudine (AZT) causes myopathy [26]; zalcitabine (ddC), 
didanosine (ddl) and Lamuvidine (3TC) cause neuropathy; stavudine (d4T) 
and Fialuridine (FIAU) cause neuropathy or myopathy and lactic acidosis [27, 
28]. The tissue distribution of phosphorylases responsible for phosphorylation 
of NRTIs relates to their selective tissue toxicity [29]. 
The clinical features of zidovudine-myopathy are proximal muscle 
weakness, occurring 6-12 months after treatment onset, myalgia 
(predominantly in the thighs and calves), fatigue, myopathic changes on 
EMG, and elevated serum CK levels, which can increase with exercise 
[26,29]. Weight loss and elevation of the serum lactate level may herald the 
onset of zidovudine myopathy. Five weeks after zidovudine is discontinued, 
symptoms resolve, muscle histology improves and the depleted mtDNA 
rebounds. The above symptomatology occurred in patients taking high doses 

9
of AZT. Currently, with the lower dose used, the most common symptom is 
fatigue and myalgia. 
The unique histological features of zidovudine myopathy are ragged￾red fibers, many cytochrome-c oxidase-negative fibers with deficiency of COX 
(complex IV) activity and intracellular fat accumulation, all indicative of 
mitochondrial dysfunction[26]. Zidovudine is a DNA-chain terminator that 
inhibits the γ-DNA polymerase in the mitochondrial matrix, terminates the 
mtDNA synthesis and results in as much as a 78% depletion of muscle 
mtDNA [26-28]. AZT-treated patients also demonstrate high lactate production 
and marked phosphocreatine depletion, as determined with in vivo MRS 
spectroscopy owing to impaired oxidative phosphorylation. Animals treated 
with AZT and cells in culture treated with NRTIs develop similar changes. 
There is now evidence that NRTI-related neuropathy is also due to 
mitochondrial toxicity with mtDNA depletion in the affected nerves and severe 
abnormality in the mitochondria of axons and Schwann cells[27[. 
The NRTIs (AZT, ddC, ddl, d4T, 4TC) contain azido groups that 
compete with natural thymidine thriphospate as substrates of DNA pol-gamma 
and terminate the mtDNA synthesis [29]. In contrast to AZT and d4T, another 
nucleoside analogue, the Fialuridine (FIAU), causes an irreversible 
mitochondrial myopathy with lactic acidosis, because FIAU contains 3’-OH 
groups and serves as an alternate substrate for thymidine triphosphate with 
DNA pol-gamma. As a result, it is incorporated within the mitochondrial DNA 
chain causing permanent mtDNA dysfunction [29]. A syndrome of 
lipodystrophy, lactic acidosis, and myopathy has been also seen with highly 
active antiretroviral therapy, consisting of one protease inhibitors in 
combination with two nucleoside analogues, especially stavudine (d4T) [28]. 
The NRTI-induced mitochondrial dysfunction has influenced the clinical 
application of these agents especially at high doses and when combined. 
They have produced in humans a new category of acquired mitochondrial 
toxins which cause clinical manifestations that resemble the genetic 
mitochondrial disorders. 
4) DRUG CONTAMINANTS CAUSING PREDOMINATELY FASCIITIS 
 a) Eosinophilia–myalgia syndrome and toxic-oil syndrome
In eosinophilia–myalgia syndrome and toxic-oil syndrome there is 
inflammation predominantly localized to the fascia, dominated initially by 
eosinophils (eosinophilic fasciitis). These two syndromes are triggered by 
exogenous toxins and represent classic examples of myocytotoxicity due to 
adulterated natural products. These two forms of fasciitis are different from 
hyperacute necrotizing myofasciitis (“flesh-eating disease”) caused usually by 
b-haemolytic streptococci, presumably acting as a superantigen, that follow a 
variety of wounds and surgical interventions [30]. 
 The eosinophilia–myalgia syndrome was caused by prolonged oral 
intake of large doses of a contaminated L-tryptophan preparation taken as a 
therapeutic agent, mainly for insomnia [31]. There was marked systemic 
eosinophilia with generalized myalgia and moderate muscle weakness. 
Another important feature was thickening of the skin, mimicking scleroderma. 
Histologically, lymphocytes (CD8+ cytotoxic cells), and eosinophilic 
polymorphonuclear leukocytes early in the disease process, infiltrate the 
perimysial region and interstitial spaces of muscle [32]. Muscle fiber necrosis 
was rare and serum CK activity did not rise significantly. Coexisting peripheral 

10
neuropathy was not uncommon. In some cases, the muscle biopsy showed 
no abnormality, despite clinical symptoms. 
 The pathogenic factor appears to be a contamination of L-tryptophan 
with an acetaldehyde ditryptophan derivative, which seems to induce an 
autosensitisation [32]. The disease usually subsides after cessation of 
exposure but resolution may be slow. Corticosteroid therapy may help to 
accelerate recovery. 
b) Macrophagic myofasciitis 
This is a distinctive inflammatory disorder identified in several French 
patients who presented with myalgias, fatigue and mild muscle weakness 
[33]. Muscle biopsy revealed pronounced infiltration of the connective tissue 
around the muscle (epimysium, perimysium and perifascicular endomysium) 
by sheets of periodic acid–Schiff base-positive macrophages and occasional 
CD8+ T cells. Serum CK may at times be elevated. Most patients respond to 
glucocorticoid therapy, and the overall prognosis is favourable. The pathology 
is almost always seen at the sites of previous vaccinations, even several 
months later, and has been linked to a type of aluminium component used as 
a substrate for preparation of the vaccines. Macrophagic myofasciitis has 
been reported exclusively from France. The author has not seen any case in 
USA or Greece among a large number of patient referrals and review of 
biopsy specimens. 
5) TOXICITY FROM DIETARY AGENTS 
a) Germanium Myopathy 
Germanium and its compounds have been used in elixirs or dietary 
supplements promoted by health-food stores. This compound causes a toxic 
myopathy characterized by muscle weakness with vacuolization, increased 
phosphatase activity and lipid accumulations. Abnormal mitochondria are 
typically seen [34]. 
b) Emetin 
This is an alkaloid derived from ipecac used mainly as an emetic in acute 
poisoning. Syrup of ipecac is often abused by anorectics to induce vomiting. It 
may cause skin changes resembling dermatomyositis, as well as a myopathy 
with cardiotoxicity. The drug affects intermediate filaments resulting in 
disruption of the Z discs followed by breakdown of myofilaments and 
myofibrillar protein accumulations, similar to those seen in desmin myopathies 
[35].Myotoxicity is seen with doses above 500 mg given over a 10 day period. 
The changes are reversible, but recovery is slow [5]. 
6) TOXICITY FROM RECREATIONAL DRUGS 
 These include cocaine, heroin, amphetamine, PCP and ETOH causing 
rhabdomyolysis and sometimes compression syndrome [36]. The illicit drugs 
are almost always mixed with various agents. Whether the drugs by 
themselves affect the muscle, or it is the combination with the adulterants that 
trigger the toxicity, remains unclear. 
Patients with alcoholism can develop an acute or a chronic myopathy. 
The acute myopathy presents as rhabdomyolysis or myoglobinuria and it is 
preceded by muscle edema and pain. It can recur if the patient resumes 
drinking. Acute myopathy in patients with alcoholism may also be related to 

11
hypokalemia when the serum K+ concentration is below 2.5 mEq. This 
myopathy is painless, is not accompanied by muscle swelling, and is quickly 
reversible [37]. Proximal muscle weakness in patients with long-term 
alcoholism is often multifactorial and is not necessarily due to a primary 
myopathic process [37]; for example, poor nutrition, inactivity, or neurogenic 
disease may by involved. Histologically, type II fiber atrophy is the most 
common abnormality. Some long-term drinkers may experience an 
asymptomatic elevation of the serum CK level—as much as 20 times higher 
than normal levels—that is aggravated by physical activity. 
 Although the exogenous causes of myoglobinuria may be 
multifactorial, illicit drugs and alcohol account for the majority of the patients. 
In one of the largest series of 475 patients with myoglobinuria reported from 
John Hopkins, the cause was illicit drugs/alcoholism in 163 patients, followed 
by medical drugs (statins, colchicine, AZT, lithium) in 54 [38]. Less frequent 
causes were muscle diseases in 49, trauma in 42, neuroleptic malignant 
syndromes in 38, idiopathic in 34, seizures in 32, immobility in 21 and various 
medical conditions in the rest 40[38]. 
7) OTHER 
 Procainamide, Amiodarone, epsilon-aminocaproid acid (EACA) and 
antipsychotics can rarely cause myopathic symptoms. Of interest among them 
are the antipsychotics, which, even in the absence of neuroleptic malignant 
syndrome, can cause hyperCKemia. Up to 10% of the patients receiving 
clozapine, risperidone, melperone, olanzapine, loxapine, or haloperidol may 
develop CK elevation [39]. Sometimes the CK may be above 1,000. Muscle 
biopsy is usually uninformative. Because these drugs are potent serotonin 5-
HT2α inhibitors and 5HT receptors are present in the sarcolemma, the toxic 
effect may be related to blockade of these receptors [1,3]. 
 EACA, after prolonged administration, can cause a necrotizing 
myopathy. The drug is not used anymore. Amiodarone causes a neuropathy 
but when combined with simvastatin can cause rhabdomyolysis, as 
mentioned earlier. 
8) MYOPATHY CAUSED BY INTRAMUSCULAR INJECTIONS 
a) Needle myopathy 
Although intramuscular injections of various drugs can cause swelling, local 
pain or haemorrhage, it is unclear if some of the injected material can also 
cause necrotizing myopathy. Needle insertions by themselves however, can 
cause mild muscle injury and elicit an inflammatory response that might 
persist for up to a month (needle myopathy). The clinical importance of this 
effect relates to insertion of EMG needles and the subsequent performance of 
a diagnostic muscle biopsy. Muscle biopsies should not be performed at the 
injection sites at least one month after the needle insertion. 
b) Localized indurations and fibrosis 
Fibrosis of the overlying connective tissue, fascia and skin due to formation of 
granulation tissue can occur after chronic intramuscular administration of 
certain antibiotics, opiates, pentazocine and other drugs. This condition 
results in a fibrous contracture of segments of affected muscle causing a fixed 
posture of a limb [1,3,5]. Whether this is due to repeated needle trauma or 
due to a combination with the offending drug is unclear. The acidity or 

12
alkalinity of the injected material or repeated infections, as seen in drug 
addicts, may be additional contributing factors [5]. 
c) Immunity to intramuscularly injected, recombinant Adeno-Associated 
Virus (rAAV)-mediated gene transfer 
 rAAV, carrying different promoter-transgene cassettes, when injected 
into muscle for delivery of muscular dystrophy genes, can elicit a robust 
cellular immune response with CD8+ T cells invading MHC-I antigen 
expressing muscle fibers, similar to the changes seen in polymyositis [40]. 
This is due to a transgene-related effect because intramuscular injections of 
rAAV expressing no transgene do not elicit such an immune response [40]. 
The induction of cellular immunity to AAV vectors in humans appears to be a 
limiting factor of intramuscular gene delivery and requires immunosuppresion. 
At present, the development of cell-mediated cytotoxicity responses to AAV 
capsid peptides appears to limit the transgene expression in the injected 
muscle, necessitating safer vectors for direct gene delivery to the muscle.
