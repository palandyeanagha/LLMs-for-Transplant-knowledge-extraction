Use of terlipressin in critically ill children
with liver disease
Romit Saxena, Aravind Anand and Akash Deep*
Abstract
Background: Terlipressin, a long-acting synthetic analogue of vasopressin has been used in the adult population
for various indications including hepatorenal syndrome (HRS-AKI), esophageal variceal hemorrhage (EVH) and shock,
but its use in pediatrics is still limited to individualized cases and data on safety and efficacy is scant.
Methods: We reviewed the patient records of children with liver disease and Acute Kidney Injury requiring terlipressin
admitted to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) of King’s College Hospital, London from January 2010–December
2017, with special emphasis on its effect on renal parameters and adverse event profile.
Results: Twenty-one terlipressin administration records in a total of 16 patients (median) (IQR) 10 years (6.1–14.4) were
included. The drug was initially given as a bolus dose in all cases, followed by either bolus or infusion with median
dosage being 5.2 (3.8–6.7) mcg/kg/hour. After administration, a sustained increase of mean arterial pressure was
observed. There was an improvement in serum creatinine (Cr) (at 24 h; p = 0.386) and increase in urine output (UO),
especially in the hepatorenal syndrome subgroup (HRS-AKI). We found minimal evidence of gastrointestinal side effects
including feeding intolerance and vasoconstrictive side effects including cyanosis / ischaemia of extremities.
Conclusion: Terlipressin was found to be safe in critically sick children with liver disease with positive impact on renal
parameters which might be taken as a surrogate marker of HRS reversal, though effects on outcomes are difficult to
ascertain. It is important to be aware of all its side-effects and actively watch for them. Future prospective studies are
warranted to validate these findings.

Background
Terlipressin (triglycyl lysine vasopressin), is a long-acting
synthetic analogue of vasopressin. The distribution half￾life of terlipressin is 8 min and it gets eliminated in 50 min
[1, 2]. Vasopressin and its analogues have been used for
indications such as septic shock (especially catecholamine
refractory septic shock) [3–6], bleeding esophageal varices
[7–9] and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS-AKI) [10, 11]. But,
its use and research has been limited predominantly to
the adult population. Unique pathophysiology of HRS
(splanchnic vasodilatation) justifies the use of a splanchnic
vasoconstrictor like terlipressin.
Use of terlipressin in children has been limited to
vasodilatory shock [12, 13]. Experience in pediatric
population, for indications as hepatorenal syndrome, has
been limited to small case series [14]. We retrospectively
analyzed case records of children with liver disease
treated with terlipressin in our tertiary PICU (Paediatric
intensive care unit) in London. The aim of this retro￾spective study was to analyze changes in hemodynamic,
renal parameters and adverse event profile after adminis￾tration of terlipressin in children with liver disease.

Methods
A retrospective chart review was conducted using pre￾recorded, patient-centered data to study the impact of
terlipressin on renal parameters and adverse event pro￾file. We reviewed the patient records of children, admit￾ted to PICU, King’s College Hospital, London who
required terlipressin between 2010 and 2017. Data was
extracted from electronic patient records (Electronic pa￾tient record (EPR), clinical Information system (Metavi￾sion) and electronic drug charts (EPMA).
The inclusion criterion for the study was the use of
terlipressin during the period of stay in PICU for
pediatric patients admitted with liver disease. These re￾cords have been expressed as ‘patient administration
records’ for this study. If terlipressin usage was inter￾spersed by more than 15 days, it was taken as two separ￾ate entries, even if it was used in the same patient
during same admission.
Patients were classified as having hepatorenal syn￾drome, if they satisfied the acute kidney injury (HRS￾AKI) criteria as per the International Ascites Club defin￾ition 2012 [15, 16]. Nine patient administration records
(of 7 patients), satisfied the diagnosis of HRS-AKI. All
the remaining 9 patients had impairment of renal pa￾rameters in patients with liver disease, though they did
not meet the definition of HRS-AKI, due to concomitant
shock and requirement of inotropes After starting nor￾adrenaline, when the renal parameters continued to de￾teriorate, terlipressin was started in these patients with
non-HRS AKI.
The indications of terlipressin in non-HRS AKI in￾cluded refractory vasodilatory shock (refractory to nor￾epinephrine) and massive upper gastrointestinal bleed.
Terlipressin was then administered either as an infusion
or bolus, based on PICU consultant’s decision. Terlipres￾sin was continued for 7–10 days based on the response
(improvement of serum creatinine, increase of urine out￾put) and was discontinued in case of any adverse effects
or no improvement in serum creatinine/urine output
after 4 days of starting terlipressin. We doubled the dose
after 48 h if there was no response.
Statistical analysis
Categorical data was presented as counts and percent￾age, and analyzed with help of chi square test. Skewed
distribution was described as median and interquartile
ranges. For parametric tests, t test (paired or unpaired)
and for non-parametric tests, Wilcoxon signed rank test
and Mann Whitney U test were used as appropriate.
Results
Baseline parameters
We extracted data for 21 terlipressin administration re￾cords, used in 16 patients with liver disease, who were
administered terlipressin between 2010 and 2017. These
patients had a median age of 10 years (6.1–14.4 years).
All patients were treated in PICU (Table 1). Most pa￾tients had ascites (66.6%) and varices (76.19%). Seven pa￾tients were suggestive of hepatorenal syndrome-acute
kidney injury (HRS-AKI) as diagnosed by International
Ascites Club definition 2012 [15, 16].
Terlipressin was first given as a bolus in all cases,
followed by either a continuous infusion (8 instances) or
continued as boluses (13 instances). All patients had
chronic liver disease. Of the 16 patients, 10 had acute on
chronic liver failure (ACLF) with multiple organ failures
and 6 patients had decompensated liver disease with as￾cites, bleeding varices and portal hypertension. Etiologies
for hepatic impairment included genetic causes (as Ala￾gille syndrome, hyperoxaluria), metabolic causes and bil￾iary atresia (Table 2).
Impact of terlipressin on renal parameters
All patients included in the analysis satisfied the AKI
definition of increased serum creatinine above the base￾line. The impact on lactate and mean arterial pressure
(MAP) are described in Fig. 1 and Table 3. A gradual
improvement in serum creatinine was observed in the
study period up to 7 days after starting terlipressin
(Fig. 2). The median urine output prior to onset of

treatment as 0.75 ml/kg/hr. (0–7.8)(median//IQR), which
increased to 1.3 ml/kg/hr. (0–6.9).
Adverse effect profile
There were 3 adverse events observed following administra￾tion. These included 2 incidents of digital ischemia (blanch￾ing or blueness of extremities) and one incident of feeding
intolerance. In one instance, the drug had to be discontinued
because of adverse effect. No significant effect on lactate
levels was observed (Baseline - 3.3(0.7–11.23), it remained
constant, 3.48(1.1–10.6) at 1 h(p = 0.45) and 3.4(0.51–11.6) at
6 h(p = 0.688). There was no significant effect on serum
sodium as well [(0 h: 138 meq/litre (135.1–140.5); 6 h:
139(135–143)(p = 0.526);12 h:136.9(134.8–141.5)(p = 0.567);
24 h 137.5(136–140)(p:0.609)] This is shown in Table 3.
Role in hepatorenal syndrome (HRS-AKI)
There was an improvement in urine output and serum
creatinine after terlipressin administration, but the dif￾ference between the groups was not significant (Table 3
and Fig. 2). Both groups reported adverse effects (2 epi￾sodes of digital ischemia in non HRS group, and I epi￾sode of feeding intolerance in HRS group). Of the 7
patients with HRS, 5 responded with a decrease in
serum creatinine at 48 h (response rate of 71.4%)
whereas of the 9 patients with shock and on inotropes,
only 4 responded with decrease in serum creatinine and
increase of urine output (response rate of 33.3%).
Terlipressin dose
In our case series, the drug was initially given as a bolus
dose in all cases, followed by either bolus or infusion.
Doses are hence expressed as mcg/kg/hour, to account
for this difference. Most administrations were as bolus
doses of 1 mg (0.5–2 mg) at the start of drug use.
The average duration of bolus use was 40 h (0–60),
with median of 5 boluses (range: 1–44) received. The
median dose (IQR) used was 5.2(3.8–6.7 mcg/kg/hr). In
HRS-AKI we used terlipressin at the dose of 5.2 (4.5–
6.4) (IQR) mcg/kg/hr.
Outcome
Of the 16 patients, 7 patients died, mortality of 47.5%.
Of these, 2 patients had HRS-AKI, giving a mortality of
28.5% to this group. There was no statistical difference
in urine output, creatinine and mean arterial pressure,
between the survivors and non-survivors. Multiple
causes contributed to this mortality - gastrointestinal
bleeding (in 4 patients), multiple organ dysfunction syn￾drome (MODS) (in 6 patients) and sepsis (in 2 patients).
Discussion
Terlipressin is a powerful V1(vasopressin) receptor
agonist [17]. At our center, we use terlipressin for vari￾ous indications, which range from hepatorenal syn￾drome, septic shock to variceal bleeding.
Renal parameters
Splanchnic arterial vasodilation is considered important
in the pathogenesis of HRS-AKI. Use of vasoconstrictive
drugs results in splanchnic arteriolar vasoconstriction
with decreased portal pressure, thereby resulting in re￾distribution of blood flow, thereby improving renal
blood flow [18–20]. Vasopressin analogues (ornipressin,
terlipressin), octreotide and noradrenaline have been
used for the same effect.

Adult studies have demonstrated improvement in
renal parameters. When terlipressin is used in hepatore￾nal syndrome, reversal of HRS defined as decrease in
serum creatinine by 50% baseline to less than 1.5 mg/dl
is demonstrated in 45–55% cases [10, 11, 20]. In our
study population as well, we observed a drop in serum
creatinine and increase in urine output in the HRS-AKI
population as compared to non HRS-AKI patients. In
our experience, terlipressin use in this subgroup, was
safe, with minor side effects. Adult literature also con￾firms the safety profile of terlipressin when used in HRS￾AKI patients [10, 11, 21–23]. .Looking at the response
rate in HRS AKI versus those in shock, it might give us
a clue to use terlipressin only in patients where there the
patient satisfies the clinical definition of HRS-AKI.
Dose of terlipressin
There is a paucity of literature on pediatric terlipressin
usage. We could only find a single case series, where the
average unique dose of 15 to 20mcg/kg 4-hourly was
used. All of the patients in this case series received terli￾pressin as a continuous infusion at 30 mcg/kg/day [14].
In our case series, we predominantly used bolus doses
while using infusion in some. (Median dosage 5.2 (3.8–
6.7 mcg/kg/hour).
Side effect profile of terlipressin /vasopressin analogues
Most of the side-effects of terlipressin are due to its se￾vere vasoconstrictive properties. In our study, we found
minimal evidence of gastrointestinal side effects (includ￾ing feeding intolerance) and vasoconstrictive side effects
including cyanosis of extremities.
There have been many adult case reports of severe
side effects after terlipressin usage, including severe skin
necrosis (after extravasation of low dose vasopressin) [1,
24] gastrointestinal ischemia [1, 25], coronary ischemia
and increased risk of thrombosis [26]. The dose of terli￾pressin depends upon the indication for the which the
drug is being used and individual patient profile. Certain
side effects may necessitate discontinuation of the drug.
Though previous studies have reported metabolic side
effects such as hyponatremia and features of micro￾vascular ischemia with lactic-acidosis, this was not ob￾served in our study [1, 25].

Limitations
This is a single center retrospective study of patients,
hence, it carries the limitations of risk of bias and lack of
complete records due to retrospective nature of data col￾lection. In addition, the vital parameters, were recorded
with a focus on first 24 h of starting the drug. The big￾gest challenge is retrospectively classifying patients with
HRS AKI versus those with shock, though proven to be
non-pre-renal. HRS in paediatrics is not very well de￾fined. It is very difficult to prove the efficacy in terms of
bridging to transplant. Does improvement in biochem￾ical parameters equate to improved survival, cannot be
answered by our data. It is also limited by the small sam￾ple size and use of terlipressin in those patients who
were on renal replacement therapy. A prospective, ad￾equately powered, placebo controlled, multicenter trial
may be beneficial in validating these results.
Conclusions
To conclude, our experience of using terlipressin in crit￾ically ill children with liver disease shows that terlipres￾sin is safe and might be useful in decreasing serum
creatinine especially in children with HRS-AKI. Whether
reduction in serum creatinine and increase in urine out￾put translates to improved clinical outcomes both in
terms of reversal of HRS and improved survival (with or
without transplant) remains to be seen. An important
conundrum which needs to be answered is whether pro￾longed terlipressin usage can be used to as a bridge to
liver transplantation in this cohort of sick liver patients.
It is important to be aware of the side-effect profile and
expectantly manage them. Future research is needed to
validate the findings of this study.
