Abstract
Dematiaceous fungi (black fungi) are a heterogeneous group of fungi present in diverse environments worldwide. Many
species in this group are known to cause allergic reactions and potentially fatal diseases in humans and animals, especially
in tropical and subtropical climates. This study represents the first survey of dematiaceous fungi in Malaysia and provides
observations on their diversity as well as in vitro response to antifungal drugs. Seventy-five strains isolated from various
clinical specimens were identified by morphology as well as an internal transcribed spacer (ITS)-based phylogenetic analysis.
The combined molecular and conventional approach enabled the identification of three classes of the Ascomycota phylum
and 16 genera, the most common being Cladosporium, Cochliobolus and Neoscytalidium. Several of the species identified
have not been associated before with human infections. Among 8 antifungal agents tested, the azoles posaconazole (96%),
voriconazole (90.7%), ketoconazole (86.7%) and itraconazole (85.3%) showed in vitro activity (MIC #1 mg/mL) to the largest
number of strains, followed by anidulafungin (89.3%), caspofungin (74.7%) and amphotericin B (70.7%). Fluconazole
appeared to be the least effective with only 10.7% of isolates showing in vitro susceptibility. Overall, almost half (45.3%) of
the isolates showed reduced susceptibility (MIC .1 mg/mL) to at least one antifungal agent, and three strains (one
Pyrenochaeta unguis-hominis and two Nigrospora oryzae) showed potential multidrug resistance.

Introduction
Dematiaceous fungi are a heterogeneous group of fungi with
dark colonies and pigmented fungal elements. They are typically
soil saprophytes, plant pathogens, and laboratory contaminants
with a worldwide distribution in humid environments. Until 2008,
more than 130 species from 70 genera have been recorded to be
associated with infections in humans and animals [1], a vast
increase from the 59 species belonging to 28 genera reported in
1996 by Rossmann et al. [2]. The genera most frequently involved
in human infections include Bipolaris, Curvularia, Exserohilum,
and Alternaria [3]. Many of the fungi are common allergens
growing indoors. Besides causing hypersensitivity reactions in
susceptible individuals that sometimes lead to acute exacerbation
of asthma, they are also important opportunistic pathogens in
immunocompromised patients [4,5]. Although many of the
cutaneous, subcutaneous, and corneal infections associated with
dematiaceous fungi have been reported to be common in tropical
and subtropical countries [6], to our knowledge, there has not
been any extensive report on the diversity and in vitro antifungal
susceptibility patterns of dematiaceous fungi isolated from clinical
samples in a tropical country like Malaysia.
The spectrum of diseases associated with dematiaceous fungi
ranges from superficial skin and soft tissue infections to dissem￾inated sepsis with high mortality. The most common infections are
phaeohyphomycosis [7], chromoblastomycosis [8], and eumyce￾toma [9,10]. In a retrospective analysis of 101 cases of central
nervous system (CNS) phaeohyphomycosis, over half occurred in
immunocompetent patients [11]. Chromoblastomycosis is mainly
associated with Fonsecaea, Phialophora, Cladosporium, Exophiala
and Rhinocladiella species [8]. Eumycetoma is caused primarily
by Madurella mycetomatis, but the aetiological agents of this
disease vary with geographical regions [9]. In the tropics,
Curvularia species are significant causes of fungal keratitis
associated with trauma from fungus-contaminated plant materials
[12,13] while the Bipolaris, Curvularia, Exserohilum, Alternaria
and Drechslera are frequently reported to be involved in invasive
sinusitis [14–17]. Systemic dematiaceous fungal infections are rare
compared to systemic candidiasis and aspergillosis. However,
dematiaceous fungi are being increasingly recognized as invasive
human pathogens [18] especially in organ transplant recipients
[7].
The identification of dematiaceous fungi is traditionally based
on the observation of differentiating morphological structures such
as annellides or phialides, the presence or absence of collarettes on
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 August 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e104352

adelophialides, the differentiation of conidiophores, and septation
of macroconidia. Molecular tests that are available today offer an
alternative approach to the identification of dematiaceous fungi
[19,20]. The molecular test strategy most often used is DNA
amplification, followed by sequence analysis of variable regions
within pan-fungal conserved genes (18S rRNA, 5.8S rRNA and
the 59 end of the 28S rRNA) or the internal transcribed spacers
(ITS1 and ITS2) [21–23]. In the past decade, the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2
region has become a useful alternative diagnostic tool for the
identification of fungi of agricultural and clinical importance
[24,25].
The aim of this study was to appraise the diversity of
dematiaceous fungi isolated from patients with signs and
symptoms of fungal infection and the antifungal drug susceptibility
profiles of these isolates. The information from this survey could be
useful for the formulation of appropriate drug therapy for patients
with suspected fungal infections in a tropical setting.

Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
This study involved only the phenotypic and phylogenetic
analysis of dematiaceous fungi isolated from routine cultures in the
mycology laboratory. As no information was used that could lead
to patient identification, it was considered unnecessary to apply for
approval from the university’s Medical Ethics Committee (http://
www.ummc.edu.my/index.php/2011-09-28-08-46-26/2011-10-03-
03-14-40/158-ummc-medical-ethics).
Sample Collection and Processing
The fungal isolates examined in this study were obtained from
clinical specimens collected from patients attending the University
Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC), Malaysia. Skin scrapings and
nail clippings were collected from patients with suspected
dermatomycosis. Respiratory specimens were routinely screened
for fungal pathogens in patients presenting with respiratory tract
infection. Other tissue fluids and tissues were processed for fungal
isolation only on request by physicians when patients had clinical
manifestations of fungal infection. All specimens were processed
according to the laboratory’s standard operating procedures
(SOP). Direct microscopic examinations were performed on skin
scrapings, hair and nail clippings treated with 40% potassium
hydroxide (KOH), and on tissue smears after staining with Gram
and Gomori’s methenamine-silver nitrate stains. Cultures were put
up on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) with chloramphenicol
(0.25 g/mL) and sheep blood agar. Blood specimens were placed
into BD BACTEC Myco/F Lytic Medium for incubation in the
BD BACTEC 9240 Blood Culture System (Becton Dickinson,
USA). Positive blood samples were sub-cultured onto SDA with
chloramphenicol and sheep blood agar. Swabs and nasopharyn￾geal secretions were inoculated directly onto SDA with chloram￾phenicol and sheep blood agar.
Fungal Isolates
Fungal isolates were grown on SDA incubated at 30uC for up to
4 weeks with alternate day examination for growth. When mixed
colonies were observed, each colony type was sub-cultured for
purity. Each fungal culture was observed macroscopically for
colonial characteristics such as colour, texture, and topology.
Tease mounts and slide cultures were carried out to study the
arrangement of conidia under the light microscope. Slide cultures
were prepared by growing the fungi on Potato Dextrose Agar
(PDA) to encourage mould sporulation for 7 to 14 days at 30uC.
The slides were examined periodically, with lactophenol cotton
blue staining carried out when sufficient growth was attained.
DNA Extraction
Pure cultures on SDA plates were harvested by flooding each
plate with 3 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4)
followed by gentle scraping of the agar surface with an L-shaped
glass Pasteur pipette. The suspension was then collected into a
15 mL centrifuge tube with PBS washed glass beads and vortex￾mixed for 5 min. For DNA extraction, 200 mL of suspension was
processed with the ZR Fungal/Bacterial DNA MiniPrepTM (Zymo
Research, USA) according to the protocol provided by the
manufacturer.
PCR and Sequencing
For the amplification of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region, the ITS1
(5’- TCC GTA GGT GAA CCT GCG G -3’) and ITS4 (5’- TCC
TCC GCT TAT TGA TAT GC -3’) primer sets were used as
forward and reverse primers respectively [26]. The 20 mL reaction
volume contained 0.2 mM of each primer, 0.2 mM of deoxynu￾cleotides, 1.5 mM of MgCl2, 1X PCR buffer, and 1 unit of
DyNAzymeTM EXT DNA polymerase (Finnzymes, Finland)
together with 5 mL extracted DNA. The PCR parameters
consisted of an initial denaturation at 95uC for 5 min, followed
by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94uC for 30 seconds, annealing at
58uC for 30 seconds, extension at 72uC for 1 min, and a final
extension at 72uC for 10 min. The PCR product was then
electrophoresed in 1% (w/v) agarose gel at 120 V for 30 min,
purified and sent for Sanger sequencing (1st Base Laboratories
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia). Base and quality calling of sequenced
ITS was performed using TraceTuner v3.0.6 [27]. Lucy version
1.20 [28] and the included zapping.awk script was then run to trim
low quality bases (Phred value ,20) called by TraceTuner from
both ends of the sequences. Cleaned sequences with complete
ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 regions and consensus sequences of duplicated
ITS copies were subjected to further analysis. The sequences
obtained in this study were deposited in GenBank under accession
numbers shown in Table S1.
Data Mining
Unique ITS nucleotide sequences with complete ITS1-5.8S￾ITS2 regions were searched against National Centre for Biotech￾nology Information (NCBI, US) non-redundant database using
local Nucleotide-BLAST program to identify the molecularly￾related isolates. To avoid false identification due to the errors
deposited in NCBI GenBank database, we collected the top five
hits from the blast results. ITS sequences of all species collected
were then randomly mined from the NCBI GenBank for their
complete ITS sequences with at least two sequences verified for
each species, except when there was only one record in the
database.
Phylogenetic Analysis
All ITS sequences from clinical isolates, together with those
retrieved from the NCBI database and two out-group strains of
Saccharomyces boulardii, were subjected to phylogenetic analysis.
Multiple sequence alignment of all data mined ITS sequences was
generated using M-Coffee [29] which adopted other packages to
compute the alignments and used T-Coffee to combine all these
alignments into one unique final alignment. Phylogenetic analysis
was then performed using MrBayes [30]. Bayesian MCMC
analysis was started by sampling across the entire general time
reversible (GTR) model space. A total of 600,000 generations were
run with a sampling frequency of 100, and diagnostics were
calculated every 1,000 generations. A burn-in setting of 25% was
used to discard the first 1,500 trees.
Antifungal Susceptibility Testing
The Epsilometer Test (Etest, Biomerieux, France) for antifungal
susceptibility was carried out to determine the minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) of antifungal drugs according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The antifungal drugs tested in this study

were amphotericin B (AMB), five azoles, viz. itraconazole (ITC),
voriconazole (VRC), ketoconazole (KTC), fluconazole (FLC), and
posaconazole (PSC), and two echinocandins, viz. anidulafungin
(ANID) and caspofungin (CAS).
Results
Fungal Isolates
A total of 75 (6%) black fungi were identified from a collection
of 1,250 molds isolated in the Mycology Unit of UMMC in a 5-
year period, from 2006 to 2011. These isolates were mostly
obtained from superficial skin, nail, subcutaneous and nasopha￾ryngeal specimens (62), blood (10), and tissue biopsies (3) (Table
S1). All isolates formed typical dark brown, olivaceous or black
colonies, appearing dark on the reverse side of the agar plate and
displaying septate fungal elements under the microscope.
Morphological Identification
Identification based on morphological characteristics enabled
the classification of most (89.3%) of the dematiaceous fungi at the
genus level, using the criteria previously described [19,20,31,32]
(Figure 1). Generally, Bipolaris, Curvularia and Exserohilum were
characterized by floccose and brown to black colonies. The
macroconidia of Curvularia had thin cell walls and transverse
septa. They often appeared as curved structures due to the swelling
of the central cell, which was darker compared to the end cells.
The macroconidia were thick-walled and fusiform, with three to
four septations in Bipolaris, and cylindrical in shape with seven to
eleven septa in Exserohilum. Alternaria colonies were greenish
black with short, woolly hyphae. The conidia of this genus were
longitudinally and transversely septate, brown and ovate arranged
singly or in chains. Members of Neoscytalidium produced colonies
that were densely fluffy with gray to dark gray aerial mycelia.
These fungi were typified by arthroconidia arranged in chains in a
zig-zag appearance. Cladosporium isolates were velvety with
olivaceous green to black green colonies. Their characteristic
features included conidiophores that were straight and branched
at the apical region, conidia that were ovoid to globose, with dark
scarring and arranged in chains, and ramoconidia.
Daldinia colonies appeared felty and whitish. Microscopically,
the conidiophores were irregularly branched with conidiogeneous
cells arising from the terminus, and conidia were ellipsoid.
Nigrospora colonies were wooly and white, becoming black on
aging. A single dark conidium which was spherical or oblate with a
smooth wall was found at the apex of conidiogeneous cells.
Chaetomium was characterized by dark colored perithecium with
ostiolate and covered with long setae. The ascospores observed
were mostly ovoidal, dark- colored and single-celled. The colonies
were white with aerial mycelium, becoming grayish when mature.
The Exophiala colonies were olivaceous-black, mucoid at the
center and greenish aerial mycelium were observed at the
periphery of aged colonies. Conidiophores were simple or
branched, erect and spine-like with one-celled, hyaline, subglobose
to ellipsoidal conidia. Lastly, the colonies of Ochroconis were dry,
red-brown with red-brown pigment diffused into the growth
medium. The conidiophores were cylindrical, bearing two-celled,
light brown and clavate conidia.
Morphological identification was, however, not possible when
there were overlapping characteristics between genera, and for
strains that did not sporulate. Five mycelia sterilia and three other
isolates (UM 221, UM 238 and UM 1110) could not be identified
by their morphological features alone.

Phylogenetic Analysis and Taxonomic Classification
A total of 120 ITS sequences were used for the Bayesian tree
construction (Figure 2). These comprised 41 unique sequences
from UM isolates, 10 representative sequences from 34 UM
isolates with shared sequences, 67 from reference dematiaceous
fungi and two out-group strains of Saccharomyces boulardii. The
phylogenetic tree resolved the 75 UM isolates into four distinct
classes of Dothideomycetes (74.7%), Sordariomycetes (12.0%),
Eurotiomycetes (13.3%), and one unclassified cluster made up of
UM 221 and two reference Ascomycota species. Each class
encompassed one to four members of orders comprising one to 28
UM isolates. Most of the isolates (65.3%) were in the two largest
orders Pleosporales (28) and Capnodiales (21). From their
clustering with reference strains, the majority of the isolates
(86.7%) were resolved to the species level.
Congruence between morphological and molecular identifica￾tion was observed for all Cladosporium, Neoscytalidium, Ochroco￾nis, Daldinia and Nigrospora isolates (Table S1). Among the
incongruent classifications were six of seven Bipolaris spp. and
seven of 11 Curvularia spp., all resolved in the phylogenetic
analysis as Cochliobolus spp.. UM 256 was identified as Phoma by
morphology but Pyrenochaeta by molecular analysis, while UM
212 and UM 234 were two isolates with morphological features of
Exophiala species clustered with Rhinocladiella atrovirens in the
phylogenetic tree. Of the five mycelia sterilia, only one was
identified as Nigrospora oryzae; the other 4 remained unclassified
even after molecular analysis. Similarly, of the three isolates with
no identifiable morphological features, UM 238 was resolved as a
Herpotrichiellaceae sp., UM 221 showed 100% ITS sequence
similarity with Ascomycota sp. FJ537113, while UM 1110 was
found to be closely related to Stagonospora sp. or Septoria
arundinacea.
Antifungal Susceptibility Testing
The results from the in vitro antifungal susceptibility tests varied
among the various genera and species of dematiaceous fungi in
this study (Table S1). As currently, there are no established
guidelines on MIC breakpoints for dematiaceous fungi, interpre￾tive comments in this study are based upon an MIC of #1 mg/mL
being considered an indicator of potential susceptibility for most of
the drugs used to treat infections by dematiaceous fungi [3]. Going
by this guideline, PSC showed the highest in vitro activity (96%
with MIC #1 mg/mL), followed by VRC (90.7%), ANID (89.3%),
KTC (86.7%), ITC (85.3%), CAS (74.7%) and AMB (70.7%).
FLC appeared to be the least active with 10.7% of isolates showing
potential susceptibility and 34.7% having MIC.256 mg/mL.
Among the isolates, Pyrenochaeta unguis-hominis and N. oryzae
showed reduced susceptibility (MIC .1 mg/mL) to the largest
number of antifungals with the former showing potential
susceptibility to only ANID (Table 1). Overall, 45.3% of isolates
showed reduced susceptibility to at least one antifungal.
Clinical Significance of Isolates
The ubiquitous presence of dematiaceous fungi in the environ￾ment makes it very difficult to gauge their clinical significance
when they are isolated from patient samples. In this study, we
believe the majority of our isolates are not contaminants or
colonizers as all isolates were from symptomatic patients, most of
whom had a physician’s diagnosis of fungal infection or were
started on antifungal therapy. Moreover, for superficial skin and
nail samples, positive cultures correlated well with signs of fungal
proliferation or tissue invasion under direct KOH microscopic
examination.

Discussion
With increasing recognition of the important role of fungi in
human infections, diagnostic laboratories are now expected to be
able to rapidly detect and accurately identify fungal pathogens to
ensure early and appropriate therapy for infected patients. We
have utilized the ITS sequence-based phylogenetic analysis in the
classification of most of the dematiaceous fungi in this study, with
good congruence attained with morphological identification. The
molecular species differentiation was particularly useful for the
fungi with ambiguous microscopic features, such as Phoma and
Pyrenochaeta, two coelomycetes with overlapping pycnidial,
conidial and cultural characteristics that were difficult to
distinguish [3,33,34]. In the Chaetothyriales order, the synana￾morphs of Exophiala and Rhinocladiella make the molecular
approach a better option for their identification [35,36]. Most of
the Bipolaris and Curvularia species were resolved as Cochliobo￾lus, the teleomorph of Bipolaris and Curvularia [37,38].
Nevertheless, there were five isolates not resolved to the genus
or species level by the ITS sequence analysis due to insufficient
information in the current GenBank database [39]. More
extensive sampling and further studies using multi-locus phylogeny
would improve the identification of these dematiaceous fungi in
the future.
Some of the dematiaceous fungi isolated in this study have been
previously reported to cause human infections [3,40–42]. Ten of
the 16 genera we identified are listed as potential aetiological
agents of phaeohyphomycosis in the guidelines compiled by an
expert panel of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and
Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) and European Confederation of
Medical Mycology (ECMM) [43] (Table 2). Interestingly, we
encountered seven species that, to our knowledge, have not been
reported to be associated with human infections. These are
Cladosporium dominicanum, Curvularia affinis and Ochroconis
constricta (from skin scrapings), Curvularia eragrostidis (from
nails), Daldinia eschscholzii (from skin, nails and blood samples),
Phoma gardeniae (from skin lesion swab and nails), and
Stagonospora sp./S. arundinacea (from nasopharyngeal secretion
and skin scrapings). The possibility that these clinical isolates might
be contaminants or had been due to the patients’ incidental
exposure to fungal spores cannot be totally discounted. However,
in all these cases, no other pathogens that could account for the
patients’ signs and symptoms were identified at the infected sites.
The development of antifungal susceptibility testing is relatively
recent. Various methods are now available to assess antifungal
properties [63] but these have been used mostly on common
fungal pathogens such as Candida and Aspergillus spp. [3]. The
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) has guidelines
for both broth microdilution [64] and disk diffusion [65] testing of
filamentous fungi that cause cutaneous and invasive fungal
infections. However, the interpretation of results is still problem￾atic as no reliable breakpoints have been published for mold
MICs. In the general guidelines recently proposed for a limited
number of antifungals [66], molds are considered susceptible to
AMB, ITC, PSC, VRC, and CAS when the MIC is #1 mg/mL,
intermediate when the MIC is 2 mg/mL, and resistant when the
MIC is $4 mg/mL. It is not known whether these guidelines can
be applied to dematiaceous fungi. In this study, we used the Etest
which is a commercial gradient diffusion test that has been
introduced to facilitate antifungal testing in diagnostic laboratories.
This test has been shown to correlate well with the CLSI methods
in the testing of yeasts [67] and Aspergillus spp. [68,69] against
azoles and echinocandins. In the absence of established MIC
breakpoints for dematiaceous fungi, we categorized the MICs
obtained for our isolates arbitrarily, to indicate potential suscep￾tibility (MIC #1 mg/mL) and two levels of potential resistance (.
1–32 mg/mL or .1–256 mg/mL, and .32 or .256 mg/mL). The
results showed ITC, PSC and VRC to have the best in vitro
activity against all the dematiaceous fungi tested. In contrast, more
than a third of the isolates had high MICs (.256 mg/mL) with
FLC. These observations are consistent with previous reports on
the enhanced antifungal activity of the later generation triazoles
[70,71] and the limited activity of FLC on molds [72]. Similarly,
CAS which had been previously reported to be less active against
filamentous fungi other than Aspergillus spp. [73] was shown in
our study to be less active on dematiaceous fungi than ANID and
the azoles other than FLC. Our results support the recommen￾dation by the ESCMID and ECMM to use ITC, VRC, and PSC
as the treatment of choice for phaeohyphomycosis [43]. However,
it is also evident that there is considerable variation in the pattern
of potential resistance among the diverse species of dematiaceous
fungi; hence, the choice of antifungal agents for therapy should, as
far as possible, be based on the results of antifungal susceptibility
testing in individual cases.
Conclusions
Many dematiaceous fungi are associated with invasive human
infections. In this study, we have successfully used ITS-based
phylogenetic analysis in conjunction with morphological charac￾teristics to resolve and classify the dematiaceous fungi isolates from
a Malaysian hospital. We have also demonstrated a congruence of
results from the ITS-based technique with those by morphological
traits. A combination of both approaches, together with antifungal
drug susceptibility testing, would greatly aid in the rapid
identification of these fungal species as well as in determining
the appropriate therapeutic options for human infections caused
by dematiaceous fungi.
