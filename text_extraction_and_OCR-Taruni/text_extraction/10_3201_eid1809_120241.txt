Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a major cause of illness and 
of death in the developing world and disproportionate cause 
of deaths among pregnant women. Although HEV vaccine 
trials, including trials conducted in populations in southern 
Asia, have shown candidate vaccines to be effective and 
well-tolerated, these vaccines have not yet been produced 
or made available to susceptible populations. Surveillance 
data collected during 2001–2007 from >110,000 pregnan￾cies in a population of ≈650,000 women in rural Bangladesh 
suggest that acute hepatitis, most of it likely hepatitis E, is 
responsible for ≈9.8% of pregnancy-associated deaths. 
If these numbers are representative of southern Asia, as 
many as 10,500 maternal deaths each year in this region 
alone may be attributable to hepatitis E and could be pre￾vented by using existing vaccines.
We sometimes remark that hepatitis E is so neglected 
that it fails to make the short list of neglected 
tropical diseases (1). Since the identifi cation of hepatitis 
E virus (HEV) as a distinct viral agent in 1983 (2) and 
its subsequent cloning and sequencing in 1990–1991 
(3), much has been learned about the still-perplexing 
epidemiology of this virus, which is now the leading 
cause of acute viral hepatitis globally (4). The landmark 
feature of HEV genotype 1, which predominates in 
populations in the greater Ganges fl oodplains of southern 
Asia, is increased deaths in pregnant women (5). The 
poorly understood pregnancy-associated case-fatality 
rate of hepatitis E, ranging from 7% to 40%, was noted 
in the earliest confi rmed hepatitis E epidemic in 1955 (6) 
and has since been repeatedly confi rmed by studies of 
sporadic cases and outbreaks.
Rein et al. (7) recently published their modeled 
estimates of the global incidence of HEV infections and 
associated deaths in 2005, suggesting >20 million incident 
infections and 3.3 million cases of hepatitis E per year, and 
a 20% probability of death in infected pregnant women. 
Some of these models were based, in part, on rigorous 
epidemiologic data collected by our group in a large research 
population, the Matlab demographic surveillance site in 
rural Bangladesh (8,9). Establishing reliable estimates of 
national and regional disease burden has been challenging 
because of the lack of standard assays for hepatitis E testing 
and substantial variability in the quality of commercial 
assays (10,11). However, it is clear that populations who 
show the highest incidence of HEV-associated illnesses 
and deaths are not benefi ting from existing HEV vaccines 
or public health interventions.
In the mid-1990s, success with HEV vaccination 
in primates led to phase I trials of a recombinant HEV 
vaccine in 88 adults at the Walter Reed Army Institute 
of Research (12). During 2001–2004, a phase II clinical 
trial supported by the US Army and GlaxoSmithKline 
(Brentford, UK) was conducted in 1,794 predominantly 
male military conscripts from Nepal (13), but this trial 
was embroiled in controversy from its inception (14,15). 
An earlier community trial had been forcibly terminated 
because political opposition claimed the vaccine would be 
unaffordable to populations in which the vaccine was to 
be tested (16). Ultimately, this vaccine showed an effi cacy 
of 88.5% after the fi rst dose, which increased to >95.5% 
after 3 doses (13). These data were not published until 
2007, three years after the end of the trial.
Unfortunately, GlaxoSmithKline did not pursue 
the manufacture of this vaccine, despite a growing body 
of evidence that confi rms the substantial incidence of 
Hepatitis E, a Vaccine-Preventable 
Cause of Maternal Deaths

PERSPECTIVE
HEV infections in resource-limited sub-Saharan Africa, 
Asia, and South America and recent data that indicate 
an unrecognized silent epidemic of autochthonous HEV 
infections and illnesses across most of eastern Asia and 
central and western Europe (17–19). Recent evidence from 
our group suggests that HEV may be circulating widely 
in the United States, although the attributable disease 
incidence seems low (20).
In 2005, researchers at Xiamen University in Fujian, 
China, began working on a new recombinant HEV 
vaccine to address growing concerns about the increasing 
regional incidence of HEV infections. HEV 239 was 
tested in a randomized, controlled trial involving 112,604 
participants in Jiangsu Province, where genotypes 3 and 4 
are predominant. The vaccine showed an effi cacy >99% 
in preventing clinical Hepatitis E among persons who 
completed the full 3-dose series of HEV 239 (n = 48,693) 
compared with placebo (a commercial hepatitis B vaccine, 
n = 48,663) (21). On January 23, 2012, we learned that this 
vaccine has been licensed for production and sale by the 
State Food and Drug Administration of China (22).
The initial use of this vaccine will probably be in high￾risk populations within China. However, the manufacturer 
(Xiamen Innovax Biotech Co. Ltd., Xiamen, China) has 
expressed its intent to make the vaccine available in 
other regions (23,24). Demonstration of the effectiveness 
and safety of this vaccine in diverse settings is urgently 
needed. The vaccine has yet to be tested in high-need 
populations in which genotype 1 predominates. However, 
the fact that the capsid protein used in the vaccine was 
derived from the genotype 1 Burma reference strain (25) 
gives reason for optimism that it will be effective in these 
populations.
Data on the effectiveness of this vaccine in pregnant 
women are scant because of the exclusion of pregnant 
women in the trial in China. Post hoc analysis of 68 
trial participants whose pregnancies were detected after 
receiving 1–3 doses of vaccine or placebo did not raise 
any obvious concerns (26). However, targeted safety, 
immunogenicity, and effi cacy trials in pregnant women are 
warranted. Given the years of commercial inactivity after 
the determination of effi cacy of previous HEV vaccines, 
the fact that an HEV vaccine may soon be commercially 
available in >1 HEV-endemic country is a major milestone 
on the road toward protecting vulnerable women in disease￾endemic areas from HEV infection, fetal loss, and neonatal 
death or even maternal deaths.
To further underscore the urgency of action in this 
domain, we now highlight some fi ndings from our ongoing 
work within the JiVitA Maternal and Child Health and 
Nutrition Research Site in Gaibandha, Bangladesh. Since 
2001, we have been conducting prospective pregnancy 
surveillance in a northwestern rural population, as part of 
ongoing randomized community trials that aim to reduce 
maternal and neonatal deaths (27–29). In 3 consecutive 
trials, we have enrolled >110,000 pregnant women from 
a catchment population of ≈650,000. The details of this 
fi eld site and these research activities have been reported 
(28,29). Study activities were reviewed and approved by 
the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health 
Committee on Human Research and by the Bangladesh 
Medical Research Council.
In this context, 1,091 deaths in women of reproductive 
age (245 during pregnancy or within 42 days postpartum) 
were recorded during August 2001–August 2007 by our 
surveillance system. Verbal autopsies by trained physicians 
identifi ed hepatitis, hepatic failure, or jaundice as the 
primary cause of death in 19 (7.8%) of 245 pregnancy￾related deaths and 61 (7.2%) of 846 nonpregnant deaths 
recorded. Overall, hepatitis-like illness was suggested as a 
direct or underlying cause in 24 (9.8%) of 245 pregnancy￾related and 81 (9.6%) of 846 non–pregnancy-related 
deaths (Table). In another recent study, Khatun et al. 
(30) conducted verbal autopsies for 260 neonatal and 93 
maternal deaths in populations in slums of urban Dhaka, 
Bangladesh. In that setting, viral hepatitis was reported 
to be the underlying cause for 11% of maternal deaths. 
In addition, an epidemic of HEV was documented in the 
slums at the time of the study (30).
Verbal autopsy results and other epidemiologic 
evidence also implicate hepatitis E as the probable cause 
of most deaths from sporadic hepatitis-like illness in the 
rural JiVitA cohort, with sudden onset of symptoms in 
the days or weeks before death. Although our surveillance 
system did not enable laboratory-based differential 
diagnosis of individual cases, hepatitis A, B, and C are

Hepatitis E, a Cause of Maternal Deaths
unlikely to play a major role in deaths in this population 
of women. Clinical studies of acute liver failure in 
Bangladesh have shown HEV to be the main etiologic 
agent responsible (31–33).
Serosurveys in rural Bangladesh have demonstrated 
nearly universal exposure to hepatitis A virus during 
childhood, with subsequent life-long immunity, implying 
an extremely low probability of symptomatic hepatitis A 
virus infection during pregnancy. Hepatitis C virus is rare 
in low-risk rural populations (prevalence of IgG against 
hepatitis C virus ≈1.5%) (8). Hepatitis B virus is endemic to 
rural Bangladesh, but the incidence of infection and illness 
are also low (9). Therefore, hepatitis E remains the most 
likely etiologic agent for these fatal hepatitis-like illnesses 
in pregnant women.
If these numbers are, as we suspect, representative 
of women of reproductive age and of the incidence of 
hepatitis throughout Bangladesh, as many as 1,180 of the 
≈12,000 deaths that occur during pregnancy and soon after 
childbirth each year in Bangladesh (34) may be attributable 
to hepatitis E. If we apply these proportions to southern 
Asia, <10,500 of the estimated annual 109,000 pregnancy￾related deaths in southern Asia (35) may be attributable 
to hepatitis E. Furthermore, the substantial contribution 
of hepatitis-like illness to deaths in nonpregnant women 
of reproductive age in this population deserves careful 
attention.
Hepatitis E should no longer be considered an 
obscure, newly emerging virus. More than 3 decades of 
study attest to its global dispersion and mortality rate. 
Nonetheless, etiologic surveillance across countries must 
be strengthened. Our population-based surveillance data 
suggest that ≈10% of deaths observed in pregnancy and 
in women of reproductive age in nonepidemic conditions 
could be attributable to HEV. With the availability of 2 
tested effi cacious vaccines, we must consider judicious 
and timely implementation of such interventions, where 
appropriate, to avoid a substantial portion of preventable 
deaths in these resource-limited settings.
