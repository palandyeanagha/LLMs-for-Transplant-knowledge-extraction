Mycophenolate mofetil, an immunosuppressive agent, is frequently used following bone marrow and solid
organ transplantation. Diarrhea is a commonly seen side effect of mycophenolate mofetil, which may
necessitate colonic biopsy in some patients. The histologic changes found in this setting have been reported to
mimic self-limited colitis, graft-vs-host disease or inflammatory bowel disease in isolated case reports, and
could pose diagnostic and management difficulties. The goal of this study is to define the spectrum of
histologic changes in colonic biopsies associated with mycophenolate mofetil usage. All solid organ transplant
patients who received mycophenolate mofetil and underwent colonic biopsy for gastrointestinal symptoms
from 1999 to 2007 were included in the study. Patients who did not receive mycophenolate mofetil were used as
controls. Various histologic features including architectural distortion, apoptosis, inflammatory infiltrate,
Paneth cell metaplasia and mucin depletion were subjectively evaluated and scored (scale: 0–3) by two
independent reviewers in a blinded fashion. Forty solid organ transplant patients underwent colonic biopsy for
gastrointestinal symptoms during the study period. Biopsies from 69% of patients on mycophenolate mofetil
showed histologic changes. Apoptosis (41%) and architectural distortion (66%) were seen more frequently in
patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil as compared to the control group (13%). The histologic changes in
patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil were categorized as normal/near normal (31%), inflammatory bowel
disease-like (28%), graft-vs-host disease-like (19%), ischemia-like (3%) and self-limited colitis-like (16%)
changes. Of the controls, only one patient showed a graft-vs-host disease-like histologic pattern. In conclusion,
histologic changes are frequently associated with mycophenolate mofetil use and can resemble self-limited
colitis, graft-vs-host disease and inflammatory bowel disease leading to diagnostic difficulties. Increased
awareness of the histologic spectrum of mycophenolate mofetil-induced changes is required by the pathologist
to avoid diagnostic errors.

Mycophenolate mofetil, an immunosuppressive
agent, was FDA-approved in early 1995 for prophy￾laxis of organ rejection in patients undergoing
allogeneic renal or cardiac transplantation, and in
2000 to prevent liver transplant rejection.1 The
introduction of this drug has led to a significant
decrease in the incidence of acute allograft rejection
in solid organ transplant patients.2 Mycophenolate
mofetil is a prodrug of mycophenolic acid (MPA), an
antibiotic substance derived from Penicillium stolo￾niferum. By inhibiting inosine monophosphate
dehydrogenase, an enzyme in the de novo pathway
of purine synthesis, MPA prevents the proliferation
of T and B lymphocytes and the formation of
antibodies from B cells. It also may inhibit recruit￾ment of leukocytes to inflammatory sites.3
Mycophenolate mofetil is currently used in treat￾ment regimes as an immunosuppressive agent in
both solid organ and bone marrow/peripheral blood
stem cell transplantation, as well as in treatment of
autoimmune disorders, such as lupus. Common
gastrointestinal side effects of mycophenolate mofe￾til (45% of patients) include diarrhea, nausea, Received 7 October 2008; revised and accepted 22 December

vomiting, abdominal pain and gastritis.2,4 These
complications range from mild (intermittent diar￾rhea or nausea) to life threatening (colonic necrosis
or perforation).4 Often the clinical differential
diagnosis of gastrointestinal symptoms includes
infections, graft-vs-host disease and other defined
inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract,
eg, chronic idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease.
Differentiation among these conditions is difficult
on clinical grounds and biopsies are often per￾formed to clarify the diagnosis. An accurate diag￾nosis is essential in these patients due to the
differences in treatment for each condition.
Although dose reduction due to drug toxicity may
relieve symptoms, it may also increase the risk of
acute rejection and have an adverse impact on long￾term graft survival.5
Histologic changes seen in patients with myco￾phenolate mofetil-associated drug toxicity have
been reported to mimic graft-vs-host disease,6
inflammatory bowel disease,7 ischemia8 or acute
self-limited colitis in isolated case reports. The
histologic similarities with other conditions can
pose diagnostic and management difficulties, parti￾cularly in allogeneic bone marrow/peripheral blood
stem cell transplantation when graft-vs-host disease
is in the clinical differential diagnosis. Although
graft-vs-host disease is a well-recognized and not
infrequent complication of allogeneic bone marrow/
peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, it is
much less common in solid organ transplantation
(eg, liver, kidney and heart). Therefore, patients with
solid organ transplantation represent a reasonable
population to study the histologic changes of
mycophenolate mofetil. The goal of this study was
to define the spectrum of histologic changes in
colonic biopsies associated with the use of myco￾phenolate mofetil. Bone marrow/peripheral blood
stem cell transplant patients were excluded to avoid
confusion between graft-vs-host disease and myco￾phenolate mofetil toxicity.
Materials and methods
All solid organ transplant patients who were
receiving mycophenolate mofetil and had colonic
biopsies performed for gastrointestinal symptoms
between 1999 and 2007 were identified from a
search of the pathology database and included in the
study. Transplant patients who did not receive
mycophenolate mofetil during the same period were
used as controls. Bone marrow/peripheral blood
stem cell transplant patients were excluded to avoid
uncertainty of the final diagnosis with regards to
graft-vs-host disease and mycophenolate mofetil
toxicity. Patients with known active viral infections
(CMV, HIV and HSV) or a preexisting diagnosis of
inflammatory bowel disease were also excluded.
The possibility of graft-vs-host disease was consid￾ered low in the clinical differential diagnosis and
was further excluded by clinical follow-up in all
patients. The following histologic features were
evaluated and scored subjectively on a scale from
0 to 3: architectural distortion, crypt cell apoptosis
(45/100 crypts), chronic or acute inflammatory
infiltrate, mucin depletion, crypt loss, cryptitis and
Paneth cell metaplasia. Apoptosis was graded as 0:
o5/100 crypts, 1 þ : 5–10/100 crypts, 2 þ : 11–20/
100 crypts and 3 þ : 421/100 crypts. On the basis of
the overall histology, the cases were placed in one of
the following categories: normal/near normal, ische￾mia-like, inflammatory bowel disease-like, graft-vs￾host disease-like and self-limited colitis-like.
Changes were considered ischemia-like when the
biopsy showed mucin-depleted crypts with pre￾served crypt architecture, lack of significant lamina
propria inflammation (0 to 1 þ ) and crypt dropout
with or without erosions. The pattern was consid￾ered inflammatory bowel disease-like when the
biopsy showed moderate to marked crypt architec￾tural distortion (2 to 3 þ ) with increased lamina
propria lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate (1 to 3 þ ). The
changes were considered graft-vs-host disease-like
when there was increased enterocyte apoptosis in
the absence of any lamina propria inflammation and
lack of significant crypt architectural distortion.
Minimal crypt distortion (0 to 1 þ ) or rare branching
crypts were considered acceptable for the graft-vs￾host disease-like pattern. Presence of neutrophil￾predominant lamina propria infiltrate with crypti￾tis/crypt abscesses in the absence of crypt architec￾tural distortion was considered a self-limited colitis￾like pattern. Mild enterocyte apoptosis (1 þ ) was
considered acceptable with other patterns (inflam￾matory bowel disease-like, self-limited colitis-like or
ischemia-like). The clinical history, including the
presenting symptoms, medications, including im￾munosuppressive drugs, colonoscopic findings, bo￾wel preparation method and follow-up, was
obtained.
Results
A total of 40 solid organ transplant patients under￾went colonic biopsy for gastrointestinal symptoms
during the study period, of which 32 patients were
taking mycophenolate mofetil at the time of biopsy
(dosages ranged from 500 to 1000 mg twice daily).
The transplants in the mycophenolate mofetil group
consisted of kidney (17), kidney/pancreas (5), heart
(6), heart/kidney (3) and liver (1). The transplants in
patients not taking mycophenolate mofetil included
kidney (6), kidney/pancreas (1) and liver (1). The
bowel preparation methods before the colono￾scopy included GoLytely 16 (50%), phospho soda
(2/32, 6%), tap water enema (1/32, 3%) and Fleets
enema 4 (12.5%). Two patients had no bowel
preparation (2/32, 6%). The bowel preparation
information in the remaining 7 cases was not
available (7/32, 22%) (Table 1).

Biopsies were obtained from the right and left
colon in 14 patients, from the left colon only
(descending, sigmoid and/or rectum) in 7 patients
and were taken randomly (site unspecified) in 11
patients. The average number of biopsy pieces per
endoscopy was 8 (range 2–31). In patients in whom
mucosal abnormalities were seen at endoscopy,
histologic abnormalities were confined to those
sites, whereas in the remaining cases the changes
were diffuse and there was no correlation of the
biopsy site with either the severity of changes
or the histologic patterns. There was no specific
correlation between mycophenolate mofetil dose
and type of organ transplant and type of bowel
preparation with the extent, pattern or severity of
histologic changes. Owing to the small number of
cases in each category, no statistical analysis was
performed.
Pathologic changes were present in 23 (23/40,
58%) patients, whereas biopsies in the remaining 17
patients appeared normal (Table 2). Apoptosis and
architectural distortion were seen more frequently
in patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil as
compared to the control group. Six (6/32, 19%)
patients showed increased apoptosis at the crypt
bases without significant inflammation, very closely
resembling colonic graft-vs-host disease (Figure 1).
Nine (9/32, 28%) patients showed an inflammatory
bowel disease-like pattern with architectural distor￾tion (9/9, 100%), crypt abscesses (4/9, 44%), Paneth
cell metaplasia (7/9, 78%) and crypt loss (2/9, 22%).

spaces was noted in all cases; however, lamina
propria inflammatory infiltrates were milder (mostly
1 to 2 þ ) (8/9, 89%) when compared to typical
inflammatory bowel disease cases (Figure 2a and b).
One patient showed increased apoptosis in parts of
the biopsy mimicking graft-vs-host disease, in
addition to inflammatory bowel disease-like
changes. In addition, 5 (5/32, 16%) patients showed
a self-limited colitis-like pattern with mild lamina
propria inflammatory changes with cryptitis and no
architectural distortion (Figure 3). One patient
(3%) showed changes typical of mucosal ischemia
(Figure 4). The remaining biopsies were either
normal or had only nonspecific changes that
included mucin depletion, rare branching crypts or
mucosal edema and were considered near normal.
In comparison, 8 of the 40 patients were not taking
mycophenolate mofetil and were on a combination
of prednisone, tacrolimus, sirolimus and/or cyclo￾phosphamide. Only 1 of these 8 cases (13%) showed
a mild increase in apoptosis of the crypt epithelium
and the pattern was considered graft-vs-host dis￾ease-like. The remaining cases were histologically
unremarkable (Table 3).
In 25 of the 32 patients on mycophenolate mofetil
(78%), the colonoscopy findings were available
(Table 2). Of these, 17 (68%) patients appeared to
have normal mucosa at the time of the procedure.
The remaining 8 (32%) patients showed edema,
aphthous ulcers and/or friable mucosa. The majority
of biopsies that showed graft-vs-host disease-like
changes were associated with endoscopic mucosal
abnormalities on colonoscopy; however, such
changes were also seen in the absence of any
endoscopic abnormalities (Table 2). None of the
patients had other systemic manifestation of
graft-vs-host disease, eg, skin lesions or liver
involvement.
In 15 (47%) of the patients on mycophenolate
mofetil therapy, mycophenolate mofetil was either
withdrawn or used in reduced dosages that resulted
in improvement of the symptoms. In 8 cases, the

infiltrate can be more dense.

diarrhea completely resolved following reduced
dosage/withdrawal of mycophenolate mofetil. In
13 patients, the drug was continued with continua￾tion of the diarrhea. Follow-up on the remaining
patients is not available at present. Biopsies follow￾ing improvement in symptoms were performed on
two patients. In one patient with near normal
histology on the initial biopsy, the follow-up biopsy
performed 9 months later remained similar. The
second patient with graft-vs-host disease-like
changes on follow-up biopsy 1 month later showed
near normal histology.

Discussion
This study represents the largest report to date of the
spectrum of histologic changes associated with
mycophenolate mofetil therapy. Previous case re￾ports and a small series have shown that mycophe￾nolate mofetil can produce histologic changes in the
bowel that can mimic inflammatory bowel disease,
graft-vs-host disease, self-limited colitis and ische￾mia.6–8 The case report by Kim and Park8 described a
49-year-old woman with diarrhea following renal
transplantation who was found to have mucosal
ulcers, hyperemia and edema during colonoscopy.
Findings on biopsy were consistent with ischemic
colitis. In the only other series looking at the
histologic features induced by mycophenolate mo￾fetil, a graft-vs-host disease-like pattern in patients
taking mycophenolate mofetil was described.6 In
this study, 20 renal transplant patients on myco￾phenolate mofetil were examined.6 The parameters
looked at in this study were crypt enterocyte
apoptosis, architectural disarray, epithelial cell
atypia, lamina propria inflammation, intraepithelial
lymphocytes, neuroendocrine cells, mononuclear
cell apoptosis and mucosal vascular injury. Patients
receiving mycophenolate mofetil were compared to
bone marrow/peripheral blood stem cell transplant
patients with documented graft-vs-host disease,
other renal transplant patients without mycopheno￾late mofetil in their regimen, patients with inflam￾matory bowel disease or infectious colitis and
normal colon from patients with no known disease.
Our study showed similar findings in renal, pan￾creatic, heart and liver transplant patients. In our
study, we also found histologic changes that simu￾lated inflammatory bowel disease and self-limited
colitis. These changes appear to occur more in
patients on mycophenolate mofetil than those in the
control group.
The distinction between mycophenolate mofetil￾associated graft-vs-host disease-like changes and
true graft-vs-host disease is of great clinical signifi￾cance. Although graft-vs-host disease in solid organ
transplant patients is uncommon (the exact inci￾dence is unknown), it can occur in patients 1–11
weeks following transplantation.9 Solid organs con￾tain immunologically competent cells from the
donor that are transplanted into the recipient, which
can then initiate an immune response against the
recipient. In solid organ transplantation, the inci￾dence of graft-vs-host disease is highest following
small bowel transplant (about 5%) possibly due to a
large number of donor lymphocytes in the trans￾planted organ. In practice, however, most cases of
solid organ-associated graft-vs-host disease are seen
following liver transplantation10 because small
bowel transplantation is limited to a few centers
across the country.
The treatment for mycophenolate mofetil toxicity
is to decrease the dosage of mycophenolate mofetil,
and subsequently evaluate whether the patient’s
symptoms resolve. In contrast, the treatment for
graft-vs-host disease is to increase immunosuppres￾sion with corticosteroids and, depending on the
severity of symptoms, add other immunosuppres￾sive agents.11 Other less commonly used treatments
for graft-vs-host disease include infusion of acti￾vated host lymphocytes12 and photopheresis.13
Mycophenolate mofetil is frequently used in allo￾geneic bone marrow/peripheral blood stem cell
transplant patients and graft-vs-host disease is
estimated to occur in 33–64% of cases depending
on the HLA compatibility of the donor and recipi￾ent.14 In one study of 740 allogeneic bone marrow
transplant patients with acute graft-vs-host disease,
it was found that 81% of patients had skin
involvement, 54% had gastrointestinal involvement
and 50% had liver involvement.15 Skin involvement
is usually seen initially. Thus, correlation with other
manifestation of graft-vs-host disease (skin or liver
involvement) may be helpful in some cases; how￾ever, one may have to rely entirely on the gastro￾intestinal biopsies to resolve the issue. Another
factor that can potentially complicate this situation
is that apoptosis can be seen in colonic biopsies as a
result of drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflamma￾tory agents16 and bowel preparation, especially
phospho soda.17 In our study, we could not find
any correlation with the type of bowel preparation
used and histologic changes, although in clinical
practice this needs to be kept in the differential
diagnosis.
One case report described mucosal ischemia-like
changes in a 49-year-old renal transplant patient,
which resolved after withdrawal of mycophenolate
mofetil.8 The patient in our study is similar and had
known underlying cardiovascular disease that could
have led to mucosal ischemia. The follow-up on this
patient revealed an acute lower gastrointestinal
bleed that also supports the findings of mucosal
ischemia. The patient’s mycophenolate mofetil dose
was not adjusted and there was no recurrence of
mucosal ischemia following supportive treatment
for the gastrointestinal bleed. On the basis of our
observation and the other reported case, we believe
this might represent true mucosal ischemia, and not
necessarily represent mycophenolate mofetil-in￾duced mucosal injury. We suggest that more studies
are needed before ascribing ischemic changes to
mycophenolate mofetil toxicity.
The differentiation of mycophenolate mofetil￾induced changes from infectious colitis (self-limited
colitis pattern) could also be difficult. Examination
of the stool was not performed in the six cases of
acute/self-limited colitis pattern in our study. In two
cases with a self-limited pattern of colitis, diarrhea
resolved after mycophenolate mofetil was removed
from the treatment regimen. In another patient with
diarrhea, mycophenolate mofetil was withheld and
gradually restarted after the symptoms resolved.
There was no change in mycophenolate mofetil dose
in two of the patients with a self-limited colitis

pattern and no follow-up was available on the last
patient. The differentiation of mycophenolate mofe￾til-induced changes from inflammatory bowel dis￾ease may pose fewer difficulties in most cases, as the
inflammation in the lamina propria is generally
milder compared to typical cases of inflammatory
bowel disease. Endoscopic appearance and prior
history of inflammatory bowel disease, if available,
would also be helpful in some cases. One patient
with graft-vs-host disease-like changes showed
resolution of the histologic changes after a month;
however, since completion of the study, we have
seen a few cases with persistent inflammatory bowel
disease-like changes for months (up to 12 months)
despite some clinical improvement. Whether these
findings represent new onset inflammatory bowel
disease, where the histology has been modified by
immunosuppressive therapy or merely a response to
chronic mycophenolate mofetil-induced injury re￾mains speculation at present.
The major clinical limitations of mycophenolate
mofetil are related to hematopoietic suppression
and gastrointestinal intolerance. Although the exact
mechanism by which mycophenolate mofetil in￾duces changes in gastrointestinal mucosa is un￾known, it has been hypothesized to be caused by
MPA. Gastrointestinal epithelial cells, as well as
other cells in the body, are partially dependent on
the de novo pathway for growth and replication.18
The biopsy changes described in our patients were
seen with mycophenolate mofetil, an immediate
release formulation of MPA. Whether these changes
would also be seen with enteric-coated mycophe￾nolate sodium, which delays MPA release until the
small intestine, has yet to be investigated. Some
studies have shown an improvement in gastrointest￾inal adverse events with enteric-coated mycophe￾nolate sodium.19
In summary, in our experience, currently there is
no definite way to distinguish between mycopheno￾late mofetil toxicity and graft-vs-host disease, and
future studies are needed to more clearly address
these issues. Bowel preparation artifacts and self￾limited colitis may also be difficult to differentiate
from mycophenolate mofetil-induced colitis in some
cases. The recognition of the association between
mycophenolate mofetil and histologic changes mi￾micking graft-vs-host disease is important, given that
graft-vs-host disease is not only a significant differ￾ential diagnostic consideration in allogeneic bone
marrow transplant patients, but can also lead to
major life-threatening complications. Similarly, in
some patients, mycophenolate mofetil-induced
changes could lead to an erroneous diagnosis of
inflammatory bowel disease or self-limited colitis.
Increased awareness of the histologic spectrum of
mycophenolate mofetil-induced changes is necessary
for the pathologist to avoid diagnostic errors. Further
studies that evaluate the mycophenolate mofetil￾induced changes in cases of bone marrow transplant
patients are needed to resolve these issues.
