Abstract
In the past 5 years, around 350 patients have received haematopoietic stem cell (HSC)
transplantation for an autoimmune disease, with 275 of these registered in an international
data base in Basel under the auspices of the European League Against Rheumatism
(EULAR) and the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT). Most
patients had either a progressive form of multiple sclerosis (MS; n = 88) or scleroderma
(now called systemic sclerosis; n = 55). Other diseases were rheumatoid arthritis (RA
n = 40), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA; n = 30), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE;
n = 20), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP; n = 7) and others. The procedure-related
mortality was around 9%, with between-disease differences, being higher in systemic
sclerosis and JIA and lower in RA (one death only). Benefit has been seen in around two￾thirds of cases. No one regimen was clearly superior to another, with a trend toward more
infectious complications with more intense regimens. Prospective, controlled randomized
trials are indicated and being planned.

Introduction
Five years ago the concept of haematoimmunoablation
with HSC rescue was forwarded as a possible treatment
for severe autoimmune disease, and a statement was pub￾lished before the first patient underwent the procedure
[1•]. As of April 2000, around 350 patients had been so
treated. Thus, sufficient experience has been accumulated
to state that, in selected cases, an acceptable risk–benefit
ratio exists to justify the commencement of prospective,
comparative randomized trials to determine the place, if
any, of such an expensive and toxic procedure in the treat￾ment of autoimmune disease.
The combination of improved bone marrow transplantation
(BMT) techniques, now called HSC transplantation, sup￾portive animal data [2] and coincidental observations (ie
improvement in coexisting autoimmune disease after HSC
transplantation for conventional indications, such as aplas￾tic anaemia, leukaemia and cancer [3]) has allowed the
concept to move forward to the clinic.
Haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation
HSCs that are capable of replenishing the whole
haematopoietic and immune system can be obtained from
peripheral blood rather than from direct marrow aspiration.

http://arthritis-research.com/content/2/4/276
This process of driving the usually scanty HSCs out of the
bone marrow is called mobilization or priming, and is
achieved with high doses of cytotoxic drugs and/or with
growth factors.
Once the HSCs have been mobilized to peripheral blood,
leucopheresis, usually about 2 weeks after mobilization, is
performed to harvest the leucocytes. These leucocytes are
now rich in stem cells, and they are either cryopreserved
directly or further manipulated to enrich for HSCs, such as
CD34 selection, and then stored. This is called graft
manipulation or purging, and may include other steps to
remove unwanted cells, such as B or T cells.
With sufficient CD34 cells collected to ensure engraftment
(>2×106/kg recipient body weight), the patient returns
about 1 month later for the conditioning (haematoim￾munoablation) with cytotoxic drugs with or without radia￾tion therapy. If antithymocyte globulin is used at this stage,
its action is considered more as in vivo purging of T cells,
rather than conditioning. The graft is then returned to the
patient, and in around 10–12 days enough red cells, neu￾trophils and platelets are being produced to allow cessa￾tion of support therapy (transfusions of red cells and
platelets, growth factors and antimicrobial agents).
The recovery of the immune system is more delayed, with
a vast amount of published information available concern￾ing the recovery first of natural killer cells and B cells, fol￾lowed by CD8+, and later by CD4+ cells [4••].
A transplant-related mortality (TRM) of under 3% is often
quoted for autologous HSC transplantation, although this
only applies to adjuvant treatment for solid tumours. For
lymphoma and leukaemia, around 10% is more realistic.
For allogeneic HSC transplantation, a TRM of 15–35% is
seen, the difference being due to more complex immuno￾logical reactions leading to graft rejection and graft￾versus-host disease, which are not often seen in
autologous HSC transplantation. Early results from the
EULAR/EBMT database for autoimmune disease [5•]
suggest a TRM of approximately 8–9%, perhaps relating
to a sicker population of patients with involvement of vital
organs, such as heart and lungs.
Patient selection
From the beginning it was decided that only those patients
in whom a significant risk to life or to vital organs existed,
and who had failed a trial of ‘best available’ conventional
therapy should be treated [6••]. In addition, the patients
should be able to enjoy a reasonable quality of life if the
autoimmune process were arrested, and not be extensively
damaged by irreversible pathology, such as fibrosis. It was
also considered critical that the clinical state of the patient
at the time of transplant should not be so poor so as to
select for high morbidity and mortality without benefit.
Data on 275 reports (270 autologous, five allogeneic) from
64 transplant centres from 20 countries have now been
registered in the EULAR/EBMT database in Basel, Switzer￾land (Table 1). This has allowed a more precise definition of
inclusion and exclusion criteria that are based on experience
rather than theoretical considerations alone (Table 2). Crite￾ria for other diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus
and dermatomyositis/polymyositis are still evolving.
In addition, around 50 cases have been registered in the
Milwaukee-based International Bone Marrow Transplant
Registry (IBMTR), and nearly 50 unregistered case reports
have been published, totalling around 350 patients with
autoimmune disease who have been treated with HSC
transplantation.
Treatment regimens and protocols
Most patients have been treated in the context of a phase
1/2 pilot study, consistent with the published guidelines
(Table 3). The majority of patients with MS received mobi￾lization with cycloposphamide and granulocyte colony￾stimulating factor, followed by conditioning with BEAM
and antithymocyte globulin, and grafting with a CD4+
selected product.
There is no suggestion that one or other regimen is supe￾rior for any autoimmune disease group, although there
appears to be more procedure-related morbidity/mortality

with the more ablative regimens and severe T-cell deplet￾ing protocols. Some protocols have been revised as a
result, such as introducing lung shielding in a systemic
sclerosis (SSc) protocol, which included total body irradi￾ation, due to two possible radiation-related pulmonary
deaths (McSweeney P, personal communication).
Toxicity
Although as yet there have been no fatal outcomes pub￾lished in the literature as case reports, the EULAR/EBMT
database shows a TRM of approximately 9% [5•]. This
includes mobilization-associated mortality, an event that is
not usually reported to traditional BMT databases. The
causes of death were as seen previously with HSC trans￾plantation (ie infection, bleeding and organ toxicity), with a
tendency to occur more in certain disease subgroups such
as SSc and JIA, systemic form (Table 4). However, no
disease subgroup has been spared from fatal outcomes.
It is suspected that this may be due to a poorer clinical
state of such patients at the time of mobilization and/or
transplant, especially relating to cardiopulmonary and
other vital organ involvement, which is in contrast to MS
and RA patients. It is considered possible that a
macrophage activation syndrome could have been respon￾sible for some of the JIA fatal cases. Protocols have been
amended accordingly. These amendments include stricter
exclusion criteria for the following: SSc, including mean
pulmonary artery pressure greater than 50 mmHg; and JIA,
including avoiding transplant during periods of high sys￾temic activity, avoiding severe T cell depletion below
2 × 105/kg body weight and the use of pulse intravenous
methylprednisone during granulocyte colony-stimulating
factor support therapy (Wulffraat N, personal communica￾tion). Although these modifications are logical, there is no
hard data to confirm that they will reduce procedure￾related mortality.

Clinical outcome
Table 5 shows the outcome as reported to the
EULAR/EBMT database using the traditional BMT form of
complete remission, partial remission, no response and
death. Follow-up data includes those available after 3
months after transplant or mobilization, and is incomplete.
Further autoimmune disease subgroup analysis is under￾way, with more extensive clinical data in MS, SSc, RA/JIA
and SLE.
However, using these and other published data, some
statements are possible at this stage. In SSc, an impact
on skin score of greater than 25% improvement in nearly
70% of patients has been observed (Binks M, manuscript
submitted), and in MS improvement or stabilization of both
primary and secondary forms has been observed in 78%
[7], using the extended disability score system. In RA,
approximately 50% relapse rates have been seen [8•]
(although most authors report that the synovitis after trans￾plant is easier to control than beforehand), with similar
observations in JIA. In RA, T-cell depletion did not seem to
reduce the relapse rates [9].
In RA, there have been some other issues that complicate
the current trial planning and data interpretation. The intro￾duction of antitumour necrosis factor-α in the past year in
some countries reduced the number of ‘failed best avail￾able therapy’ patients considerably. In addition, although
full and sustained remission is unusual in RA, there is little
data to suggest that an allogeneic approach would neces￾sarily be more effective.
Future directions
Some issues are similar to the experience so far with HSC
transplantation for other conditions such as leukaemia and
solid tumour. The major one of these is the need for
prospective, randomized comparative trials to confirm the
impressions gained from phase 1 (safety) and phase 2
(efficacy) pilot studies.
There are examples where first impressions, either opti￾mistic or pessimistic, were not confirmed by such trials,
although many investigators had already formed an
‘opinion’, on the basis of their own small experience, and
were therefore reluctant afterwards to randomize patients.
Autologous HSC transplantation in breast cancer is a
good example of this.
After many meetings of involved parties, such trial designs
for MS, SSc and JIA have been generated, with the inten￾sion to extend them as multicentre studies, given the rela￾tively low incidence of these autoimmune diseases.
Outlines of these protocols are available from Basel on
e-mail (alan.tyndall@fps-basel.ch), and will soon be posted
on the EBMT Internet page for autoimmune disease
(http://gildor.conexis.es/ebmt). RA trial design is still
under discussion.
Other issues are more specific to autoimmune disease,
and therefore require an open-minded approach. For
example, growth factors for mobilization may induce a flare
of autoimmune disease, and this has been observed in JIA,
MS and RA, at times possibly contributing to a fatal
outcome. It is logical but not proven that cyclophos￾phamide given 8 days before granulocyte colony-stimulat￾ing factor could reduce such an effect, and this has been
included in the second-generation study designs.
Also, cyclophosphamide 4g/m2 for mobilization could
induce a long-lasting remission of autoimmune disease,
without the need to proceed to myeloablation, and this
could be a point of randomization in some protocols (eg in
SLE or RA). One report in RA [10] supports this concept.
In some autoimmune diseases, cyclophosphamide may be
more cardiotoxic than usual, as suggested in SSc, and
alternatives may be needed for mobilizing and conditioning.
The question regarding whether allografts should be per￾formed, especially the newer nonmyeloablative ‘minigraft’,
has been raised if relapse rate is too high after autologous
HSC transplantation. In our opinion, the point at which this
option should be considered has not yet been reached,
and the superiority of allo-HSC transplantation has not
been proven in autoimmune disease. The risk of TRM is
already higher than initially anticipated in autoimmune
disease, and it is possible that this risk in allo-HSC trans￾plantation, with its attendant risk for graft-versus-host
disease, could also be higher, despite sibling fully
matched donors.
Data collection
Complete collection of standardized transplant and
disease-specific data is essential if we are to fairly judge
and compare what has been achieved. After 2 years of
intense international collaboration, involving EULAR,

National Institutes of Health, and neurological and other
specialty groups, there are now such core data forms for
the major autoimmune disease subgroups of MS, SSc,
RA, JIA and SLE. These data are available from either
Basel (www.ebmt.org for non-American cases) or the
IBMTR (ibmtr@mcw.edu for all American registrations),
and will be integrated into BMT registries worldwide
throughout 2000.
An international meeting will take place in Basel, October
5–7, 2000, to review all the data and plan trials
(www.akm.ch/stemcell2000).
Inevitably, any such core data set must be a compromise
between enough (for outcome research) and not too much
(to ensure that the forms are filled out fully). A revision is
planned after 12 months’ experience.
Conclusion
There are sufficient data to justify proceeding to prospec￾tive, randomized comparative trials of HSC transplantation
in the treatment of severe autoimmune disease. The basic
principle of therapeutic advantage should be established
first, before ‘fine tuning’ of protocol details are tested.
Given the relative rarity of suitable cases, the expense and
risk of the procedures and the potential heterogeneity of
protocols, international multicentre trials should be under￾taken to avoid duplication of effort. This should ensure that
a minimum amount of time is devoted to determining the
role of this potentially life-saving procedure in selected
cases, or avoid unnecessarily exposing others to its risks.
