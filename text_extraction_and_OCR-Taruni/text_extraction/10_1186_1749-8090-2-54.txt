Abstract
Background: Ischaemia-reperfusion injury is still a major problem after lung transplantation.
Several reports describe the benefits of controlled graft reperfusion. In this study the role of length
of the initial pressure-controlled reperfusion (PCR) was evaluated in a model of isolated, buffer￾perfused rabbit lungs.
Methods: Heart-lung blocks of 25 New Zealand white rabbits were used. After measurement of
baseline values (haemodynamics and gas exchange) the lungs were exposed to 120 minutes of
hypoxic warm ischaemia followed by repeated measurements during reperfusion. Group A was
immediately reperfused using a flow of 100 ml/min whereas groups B, C and D were initially
reperfused with a maximum pressure of 5 mmHg for 5, 15 or 30 minutes, respectively. The control
group had no period of ischaemia or PCR.
Results: Uncontrolled reperfusion (group A) caused a significant pulmonary injury with increased
pulmonary artery pressures (PAP) and pulmonary vascular resistance and a decrease in oxygen
partial pressure (PO2), tidal volume and in lung compliance. All groups with PCR had a significantly
higher PO2 for 5 to 90 min after start of reperfusion. At 120 min there was also a significant
difference between group B (264 ± 91 mmHg) compared to groups C and D (436 ± 87 mmHg; 562
± 20 mmHg, p < 0.01). All PCR groups showed a significant decrease of PAP compared to group A.
Conclusion: Uncontrolled reperfusion results in a severe lung injury with rapid oedema
formation. PCR preserves pulmonary haemodynamics and gas exchange after ischaemia and might
allows for recovery of the impaired endothelial function. 30 minutes of PCR provide superior
results compared to 5 or 15 minutes of PCR.
Background
Since the middle 1980s lung transplantation (LTX) has
become an accepted treatment option for patients with
end-stage pulmonary disease, but ischaemia reperfusion
(IR) injury of the pulmonary graft is still a serious early
problem after LTX [1].
Ten to 20% of transplanted lung allografts develop a
severe graft dysfunction (IR-injury) that yields to a high
early mortality and ongoing morbidity [2-6]. The clinical
features are pulmonary oedema with diffuse infiltrates in
the chest radiographs, decreased lung compliance (CL),
progressive hypoxaemia, and an increased pulmonary

vascular resistance (PVR) [7,8]. Histological examinations
show alveolar damage, interstitial oedema and sequestra￾tion of neutrophils [9]. Waddell and others reported that
IR-injury predisposes grafts to early rejection by up-regu￾lation of class II major histocompatibility antigens [10],
chronic bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome resulting in
graft failure [11].
In the past multiple methods of graft preservation [8,12-
14] have been evaluated. However, the major injury may
occur within the first minutes of reperfusion [15-17].
Interventions in the early reperfusion period, for example
inhalation of NO [1], suppression of neutrophils [9,18],
decrease of oxygen radical generation [18], and pressure￾controlled reperfusion (PCR) [19] showed favourable
effects on IR-injury. Despite the documented effectiveness
of this approach after myocardial ischaemia [20] or
ischaemia of the lower extremities [20,21] equivalent data
about controlled reperfusion of the lungs are rare. In other
reports beneficial effects of controlled reperfusion by
changing the compounds of the first line perfusate solu￾tion [22,23] and leukocyte depletion [9,22,24] were
described. In rats [25] and in rabbits [26] it was reported
that PCR improved lung function after ischaemia. PCR
was previously studied in rats following 24 hours cold
ischaemia, but has not been investigated following warm
ischaemia [19].
In this model of an isolated buffer-perfused rabbit lung
the effects of different PCR periods on IR-injury following
warm hypoxic ischaemia were studied.
Methods
Reagents
Sterile Krebs-Henseleit buffer (KHB, Serag-Wiessner,
Naila, Germany) was used. The buffer contained (in mM)
125 NaCl, 4.3 KCl, 1.1 KH2PO4, 2.4 CaCl2, 1.3 MgCl2,
and 13.3 glucose; NaHCO3 was adjusted for a constant pH
in the range of 7.35–7.45. Gas mixtures for ventilation
containing 95%O2/5%CO2, 5%CO2/95%N2 and
5%CO2/6%O2/89%N2 were obtained from Linde Gas AG
(Düsseldorf, Germany).
Animal care
The study was performed in accordance to the German
laws for animal health and protection declaration and was
approved by the local authorities, Government of Rhein￾landpfalz (Reg.-Nr.: 177-07/991-3). We used male White
New Zealand rabbits of 2500–4000 g body weight (con￾ventional, normally fed ad libitum; Charles River,
Kisslegg, Germany). All animals received human care in
compliance with the European Convention on Animal
Care.
Lung preparation and experimental setup
Rabbits were anaesthetized with intramuscular xylazine
(5–10 mg/kg) and pentobarbital (30 mg/kg) via an ear
vein. Tracheal intubation was performed through a tra￾cheostomy and mechanical ventilation was started (Venti￾lator, Hugo Sachs Electronics Harvard Apparatus, March,
D) with room air at a tidal volume of 10 ml/kg and a rate
of 50 breaths per minute. The positive endexpiratory pres￾sure (PEEP) was adjusted to 2 cm H2O.
Following a median sternotomy and thymectomy the
pericardium was incised and the pulmonary artery (PA)
and the aorta were dissected free and encircled.
Two purse string sutures were placed into the free walls of
the right and left ventricle and heparin was administered
intravenously (500 U/kg). The PA and the left atrium (LA)
were cannulated via the right and left ventricles. The aorta
was ligated and the PA-cannula sutured tightly avoiding
perfusate backflow. Perfusion with sterile KHB was
started. Room air ventilation was changed to a gas mixture
of 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide to preserve the
physiological acid-base balance. The lungs were excised
while being ventilated and perfused with buffer solution.
After rinsing the lungs with 400 ml buffer solution for
washout of blood, the perfusion circuit was closed for
recirculation (total volume of 500 ml). The flow was
adjusted to 100 ml/min without exceeding a PA pressure
of 5 mmHg. The left artrial pressure was set at 2 mmHg.
Figure 1 shows the heart-lung-block mounted in a temper￾ature-equilibrated artificial thorax allowing negative pres￾sure ventilation (respiratory rate = 50 breaths/min; PEEP
= -3 cmH2O; inspiratory pressure = -12 cmH2O, deep
inspiratory pressure = -20 cmH2O each minute) with a
pressure-constant ventilator (Hugo Sachs Electronics Har￾vard Apparatus, March, D). Temperature was kept at
38°C. The pressures in the pulmonary artery and the left
atrium were registered by small-diameter tubing within
the perfusion catheter. A special pressure transducer (Val￾idyne, Hugo Sachs Elektronik – Harvard Apparatus,
March, Germany) was used to measure the pressure in the
artificial thorax. An assessment program (own software
development) regulated the flow of the perfusate allowing
for constant pressure or constant flow perfusion. Calibra￾tion showed a maximum deviation of ± 3% (Figure 2).
Assessment
After a stabilisation period all baseline values were
assessed. Perfusion solution of the inflow and the outflow
was sampled for gas and pH analysis. Mean pulmonary
arterial and venous pressures (PAP, PVP), perfusate flow
(FP), tidal volume (VT) and inspiratory and endexpiratory
pressures (PI
, Peep) were measured. Pulmonary vascular
resistance (PVR) and compliance of the lung (CL) were

calculated in real-time. Microvascular pressure (PC) was
determined by the arterial and venous double occlusion
technique [27,28]. Occlusion manoeuvres were per￾formed in end-expiration with electromagnetic tube￾clamping devices, synchronised by a D/A-A/D converter
connected to a personal computer. This converter allowed
parallel data collection at a rate of 100 Hz, further proc￾essed by an analysis program (GraphPad Prism version
4.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA
USA).
Vascular compliance was determined by venous occlusion
technique (occlusion time, 1 s). After the early steep
increase a constant low increase of pressure was detected.
The reciprocal value of this slope of the low pressure
increase multiplied with the known perfusion flow allows
calculating the vascular compliance.
Lungs included in this study had a homogeneous white
appearance without signs of oedema or atelectasis. Fur￾ther, they had pulmonary artery pressures and lung com￾pliance in the normal range, and were stable during a
steady state period of 15 minutes.
Groups
25 male New Zealand White rabbits (2.5–4 kg) were ran￾domly assigned to experimental groups (n = 5 in each
group):
Control group: no ischaemia
All other groups had 2 hours of warm (38°C) and hypoxic
ischaemia (PO2 = 50–60 mmHg)
Group A: no pressure-controlled reperfusion (PCR), i.e.
reperfusion by baseline flow
Group B: 5 minutes of PCR followed by baseline flow
Group C: 15 minutes of PCR followed by baseline flow
Group D: 30 minutes of PCR followed by baseline flow
Experimental protocol
After the early steady state period (15 minutes) all base￾line values were measured (Figure 3). After these measure￾ments the ventilation gas was switched to an anoxic gas
mixture (5% CO2 in nitrogen) to reduce the alveolar oxy￾gen tension. After 10 minutes of anoxic ventilation per￾fusate gas values were assessed and ventilation and
perfusion were stopped. The outflow tube was clamped
and the intravascular pressure adjusted to 5–6 mmHg by

isolated buffer-perfused lung. The lungs are mounted in a 
water-heated glass-chamber ("artificial thorax") that allows 
for negative pressure ventilation. The negative pressure 
inside the chamber is measured by a transducer (Paw) and 
used to calculate the dynamic lung compliance. The tidal vol￾ume is calculated by integration of the flow signal of the 
pneumotachograph (P). The buffer solution is stored in the 
reservoir and equilibrated with a gas mixture that contained 
carbon dioxide (5%) and oxygen (6%). The solution is 
pumped by a roller pump and the flow is pressure-controlled 
regulated by a software program. The pressure transducers 
(arterial Pa, venous Pv) are adjusted to the height of the 
hilum.

slowly pumping of the perfusate. Then also the inflow
tube was clamped to maintain a positive intravascular
pressure [29]. During 2 hours of warm (38°C) hypoxic
ischaemia a negative pressure of -3 cmH2O in the artificial
thorax was preserved. Just before reperfusion ventilation
was started again and the lungs were deeply inflated by
lowering the inspiratory pressure down to -20 cmH2O.
Reperfusion was started after full expansion of the lung.
Group A lungs were immediately reperfused by the base￾line flow within 15 seconds. In groups B to D the reper￾fusion started pressure-controlled limited to a maximum
perfusion pressure of 5 mmHg for the period of PCR.
Thereafter lungs were perfused using baseline flow. Meas￾urements followed immediately at the beginning (0
minute) and after 5, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes of
reperfusion. At the end of the experiment lung specimen
were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C.
Wet-to-dry weight ratio
Lung wet-to-dry weight (W/D) ratio was used as a meas￾urement of pulmonary oedema. Samples of lung tissue
were weighed and a drying period of 48 h at 80°C ensued.
The weight immediately following reperfusion and the
weight after drying were used to calculate the lung wet-to￾dry weight ratio.
Myeloperoxidase activity
Quantitative myeloperoxidase activity was determined
using the adapted procedures of Okabayashi and associ￾ates [30]. Ten to 15 mg of dry lung tissue were homoge￾nised in 1 ml of 0.5% hexadecyltrimethylammonium
bromide, 5 mmol/L EDTA, and 50 mmol/L potassium
phosphate buffer (pH 6.2) with a tissue grinder (Ultra tur￾rax T18, Ika, Staufen, Germany). The homogenate was
centrifuged at 10,000 g for 15 minutes at 4°C. The super￾natant was assayed for total soluble protein by the
method of Pierce Laboratories. Fifty microliters of super￾natant were combined with 0.6 ml Hanks bovine serum
albumin, 0.5 ml of 100 mmol/L potassium phosphate
buffer (pH 6.2), 0.1 ml 0.05% H2O2, and 0.1 ml of 1.25
mg/ml o-dianisidine. The optical density was measured at
460 nm (M4QII, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Col￾our development from 5 to 20 minutes is linear. Enzyme
activity is expressed as the change in optical density units
per minute per milligram of tissue protein (δOD/min/mg
protein).
Statistics
All values are expressed as means ± standard deviation.
Statistical analysis was performed using the software pack￾age GraphPad Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Prism version 4.00
for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).
Individual means between groups were compared by 1-
way analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction for
multiple comparisons. Oxygenation, lung compliance
and haemodynamic parameters during the reperfusion
period were analysed using 2-way analysis of variance
with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. P￾values less than 0.05 were considered as significant.
Results
Oxygenation capacity
The difference in oxygen partial pressure (PO2) between
groups at successive intervals was significant (p < 0.0001),
signalling a lasting impairment in oxygenation capacity of
most groups due to IR-injury (Figure 4). The overall differ￾ence in PO2 between groups was also significant (p <
0.0001) as well as the interaction between time and group
(p < 0.0001), pointing out the decline in oxygenation
capacity which was different between groups because of
different grade of IR-injury. Lungs of group A without PCR
developed a severe damage and immediate oedema for￾mation (Figure 4A) with a significant decrease in PO2 to
77 ± 18 mmHg (p < 0.001). In contrast, PCR resulted in a
variable oxygen transfer. There was a significant decrease
in PO2 for group B (5 min PCR) to 264 ± 91 mmHg (p <
0.001 compared with control group) and in group C (15
min PCR) with statistical significance after 30 to 120 min
with 436 ± 87 mmHg compared with 561 ± 42 mmHg of
control group (p < 0.001). Only group D (30 min PCR)
preserved a high PO2 during the whole perfusion period

depicts the protocol for the control group. After preparation 
and at least 15 minutes of stabilization all baseline values 
were measured. Two hours with normal ventilation and per￾fusion ensued without ischaemia followed by another two 
hours for measurements.

(562 ± 35 mmHg) without a significant difference to the
control group. At 120 min groups A to C had also signifi￾cant lower PO2 values compared with group D (p < 0.01).
Figure 4B depicts the shapes of PO2 changes over time for
all groups starting with the time point of reperfusion by
baseline flow. The linear regression functions for group A
to C show significant different slopes compared with the
control group (p < 0.0001).
Compliance of the lung
Lung compliance (CL) was only stable in the control
group over time (Figure 5). All other groups showed a
decrease of CL after ischaemia. The differences in CL within
groups at successive time intervals of reperfusion and
between groups were significant (p < 0.0001). Without
PCR (group A) there was a steep decrease in CL down to 15
± 13% of the baseline values. After ischaemia 30 minutes
of PCR (group D) showed the highest CL. However, also
in this group a significant decrease (76 ± 12%) compared
with the control group (106 ± 7%) was found after 60
minutes (p < 0.05). This difference remained stable until
the end of the experiment with 70 ± 18% (group D) com￾pared with 100 ± 5% (control group, p < 0.05). Group B
and C showed also a significant loss of compliance to 30
± 13% and 41 ± 27%, respectively (p < 0.001). This was
also significantly lower compared with group D (p <
0.01).
Haemodynamics
Mean pulmonary artery pressure
Mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) was significantly
different between groups (p < 0.0001). The differences
within groups at successive time intervals of reperfusion
were also significant (p = 0.0227). Figure 6A shows that
lack of PCR resulted in a significant increase of PAP to 53
± 14 mmHg at the end of the experiment (p < 0.001). All
other groups with PCR developed also a transient increase
in PAP with the highest value of 11.8 ± 5.1 mmHg for

group B. However, these differences reached no signifi￾cance compared to the control group.
Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR)
The differences between groups and within groups at suc￾cessive time intervals of reperfusion were significant (p <
0.0001). Without PCR (group A) PVR increased progres￾sively (Figure 6B) and reached 755 ± 113% compared
with baseline values (p < 0.001). All groups with PCR
developed a significant early rise in PVR up to 539 ± 141%
(group B), 432 ± 211% (group C) and 682 ± 288% (group
D), respectively (p < 0.01). But then in all PCR groups PVR
decreased continuously. At the end of the experiment the
baseline was reached. Despite a steady decrease of PVR in
group D until 15 minutes of PCR a significant elevation
with 345 ± 230% of PVR compared with the control group
with 113 ± 11% (p < 0.05) was found.
Perfusate flow

significant reduced compared with baseline perfusion (p
< 0.001). However, the values in all PCR groups were
highly variable.
Vascular compliance
The differences between groups and within groups at suc￾cessive time intervals of reperfusion were significant (p <
0.0001), reflecting a sharp decrease in vascular compli￾ance (CV). After ischaemia and reperfusion there was a sig￾nificant decrease in CV (Figure 7B) approximately down to
50% of the baseline values (p < 0.003). After 15 minutes
all PCR groups showed improvement in CV. After 90 min￾utes there was still a lower CV compared to baseline for all
PCR groups, but the differences did not reach significance.
Wet-to-dry weight ratio (W/D-ratio)
Uncontrolled reperfusion resulted in severe oedema for￾mation (Figure 8) indicated by a high W/D-ratio of 15.4 ±
1.2. PCR reduced significantly the oedema formation with
the lowest value for group D with 9.8 ± 0.8 (p < 0.001
compared with group A).
Myeloperoxidase assay
Myeloperoxidase activity (Figure 9) of resident lung leu￾kocytes was significantly higher in group D than in group
A (0.040 ± 0.008 vs. 0.121 ± 0.055 δOD/min/mg protein,
p < 0.05). Also groups B and D showed higher values than
group A but these differences did not reach significance.
The values of the control group and group D were compa￾rable (0.135 ± 0.060 vs. 0.121 ± 0.055 δOD/min/mg pro￾tein).
Discussion
This study examined the effects of pressure-controlled
reperfusion (PCR) on lung IR-injury in a model of warm
ischaemia and reperfusion of the isolated buffer-perfused
rabbit lung. Uncontrolled reperfusion (immediate resto￾ration of the baseline flow) leads to severe oedema forma￾tion, rapid decrease in oxygenation capability (decrease in
PO2) and lung compliance (CL). This was accompanied by
a massive increase of pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP)
and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). These findings
are in concordance with other studies which also demon￾strated severe lung injury after uncontrolled reperfusion
in rabbits [14,26], rats [25] and pigs [31]. All groups with
pressure-controlled reperfusion showed less damage in
early lung function similarly to other reports
[22,25,26,32].
The aim of this study was to investigate the optimal length
of PCR to reduce IR-injury. It is clearly shown that 30 min￾utes of PCR (group D) were superior in attenuating the
early IR-injury of the lungs. Only lungs in group D
remained a high oxygenation capacity, developed only a
slight decrease in CL and showed the lowest values of PAP
and PVR. But vascular compliance (CV) declined in all
ischaemic groups compared with baseline suggesting
some endothelial dysfunction.
Shorter periods of PCR were less effective in protecting the
lungs against IR-injury probably because of severe
endothelial dysfunction and lung function progressively
worsened.
These data suggest that endothelial permeability in the
ischaemic lung was at least increased during the first 15
minutes. Therefore, controlled early reperfusion pressure
in our model should exceed 15 minutes. After that time

recovery of the endothelial function is satisfactory to pre￾vent the lungs from severe oedema formation.
Our results are in contrast to the data from Bhabra and
colleagues [25] who reported in a rat transplantation
model that already 10 minutes of PCR prevented the lungs
from severe IR-injury. The main differences to our model
are (1) the use of a whole animal model, (2) cold storage
of the lungs before reperfusion, (3) positive versus nega￾tive pressure ventilation, and (4) a different species. So,
these reasons may contribute to the difference in the peri￾ods of PCR that are necessary for an effective lung protec￾tion. Fiser and others showed in rabbits some
improvement of lung function after pressure-controlled
reperfusion, but this period lasted for only 5 minutes and
this was not enough to preserve the oxygenation capabil￾ity of the lungs [33].
Ischaemia-reperfusion injury
IR-injury remains a major threat in clinical lung trans￾plantation [2,6,7,11,16,34]. Although we do not know
the exact mechanisms of this phenomenon, clinical stud￾ies have suggested that patients with pre-existing pulmo￾nary hypertension are at increased risk for reperfusion
injury after lung transplantation [31,32,35].
Recently, studies described endothelial cell damage as a
trigger that leads to total organ failure, but the cause of
this injury is multifactorial [16-18,36]. One important
cause is the renewed oxygen supply to the ischaemic organ
during early reperfusion provoking formation and activa￾tion of various humoural mediators of injury and inflam￾mation [18]. These humoural factors cause an early
endothelial dysfunction that leads to marked decline in
nitric oxide and prostaglandin release [18].
In addition, an increased hydrostatic gradient across
endothelial membranes increases the reperfusion injury
in patients with pulmonary hypertension. The accompa￾nying endothelial disruption results in collagen exposure,
which may activate leukocytes against the lung tissue and
contribute to the severe lung damage [9,37].
Controlled reperfusion
Controlled organ reperfusion is well known and several
experimental studies have been performed to minimize
the IR-injury [22,25,30,37-39]. Most have centred on add￾ing substrate to the flush solution, such as oxygen-derived
free radical scavengers [8], agents that block neutrophil￾endothelial interactions [9,40], endothelial protective
agents [33], or haemodilution [39].
Other reports focus on manipulating the onset of reper￾fusion. Allen et al. described the beneficial effect of
regional substrate-enriched blood cardioplegic reper￾fusion after 4 hours of warm regional ischaemia of the
heart [41]. Also in acute limb ischaemia application of
controlled reperfusion lessened the reperfusion response
[20,21]. Some reports described the effect of controlled
reperfusion in lung ischaemia. In these studies the authors
have shown that reperfusion with low initial PAP at least
partially decreased IR-injury [25,26,32,42,43]. But in
these experiments PCR was almost only one part in the
concept of controlled reperfusion and it was combined
with other methods like leukocyte depletion, adding pro￾tective agents, or varying the composition of the perfusate
solution. So, the importance of the length of PCR is not
clear in the concept of controlled reperfusion.
In our study we focused only on the length of PCR. So, we
were able to determine the effects of PCR on ischaemic
lungs unaffected by other therapeutic options.
With different periods of PCR lungs showed a gradually
improved function with only slight damage in group D.
But especially figures 6B and 7A depict that after 30 min￾utes of PCR there was also a significant decrease in per￾fusate flow and an increase in PVR suggesting still a
functional injury of the vasculature.
The intrapulmonary leukocyte pool and blood leukocytes
are considered as a trigger of IR-injury [24,44-46].
Although many investigations have confirmed the role of
neutrophils in reperfusion injury [9,24,44,47], other have
questioned neutrophil involvement [48]. One report of
Fiser et al. could show that in the earliest phase of reper￾fusion injury the donor (resident) pulmonary leukocyte
pool plays an important role [46]. They blocked the pul￾monary macrophages with Gadolinium chloride, a rare
lanthanide earth salt, which significantly attenuates at
least the earliest phase (30 min) of reperfusion injury. In
our experiments we were able to focus on the intrapulmo￾nary leukocyte pool because perfusion consisted of KHB￾solution adding no other blood cells.
The lung capillaries harbour large pools of immunocom￾petent cells. Neutrophils represent the largest intracapil￾lary population followed by lymphocytes and monocytes
[45]. Interestingly, we could show that after 30 min of
PCR myeloperoxidase activity was significantly higher
compared with lungs without PCR signalling that much
more resident leukocytes were present in these less
harmed lungs. So, one might speculate that long-lasting
PCR prevents the intrapulmonary leukocytes against acti￾vation which attenuates reperfusion injury.
At the moment, the effects of PCR during early reper￾fusion are not well understood. The reduced perfusion
pressure (1) might decrease endothelial disruption, (2)
prevent activation of resident intrapulmonary leukocytes

(3) stabilize the endothelial function, and (4) improve
restoration of normal endothelial and muscular integrity.
This might be important in all patients with marked pul￾monary hypertension, especially after LTX for primary or
secondary pulmonary hypertension [35]. Future experi￾ments should focus on the endothelial muscular integrity
of the pulmonary vasculature to further elucidate the
mechanisms of PCR.
Limitations
Like other animal models our model has limitations. First,
we used the isolated buffer-perfused rabbit lung and not a
whole animal model. But the advantages are (1) focusing
on the lung, (2) constancy of circulatory and ventilatory
parameters, and (3) avoidance of immunological phe￾nomena that could not be ruled out in whole animal
transplantation models.
Further, we are using the model of warm hypoxic ischae￾mia in contrast to the standard of cold ischaemia in LTX.
However, a recent report from Warnecke and co-workers
inferred no qualitative difference between these two types
of ischaemia [49]. So both models are utilizable in exper￾iments focusing on IR-injury.
Clinical implications
Our results strongly recommend to applicate PCR after
prolonged lung grafts ischaemia. In our study at least 15
to 30 minutes of PCR are required to guarantee a satisfac￾tory organ function. In the clinical setting this is obviously
time-consuming, but adding other modalities like inhala￾tive application of prostaglandins, or application of poly￾ADP ribose synthetase inhibitors to the concept of pres￾sure controlled reperfusion may further ameliorate IR￾injury of the lungs. Combining several factors of control￾led reperfusion should lessen the necessary length of PCR.
Several measures of controlled reperfusion can hopefully
reduce lR-injury of the lungs and may decrease the risk of
LTX. The pool of possible organ donors may be extended.
Conclusion
Our study demonstrates the positive effects of PCR on pul￾monary IR-injury. The length of PCR is critical for early
lung function and a period of 30 minutes is effective to
keep acceptable oxygenation ability. But recovery of the
endothelial muscular function of the pulmonary vascula￾ture was not complete. Further experiments are warranted
to discover the synergistic effects of PCR with other pro￾tective strategies and to clarify the positive effects on the
pulmonary vasculature.
