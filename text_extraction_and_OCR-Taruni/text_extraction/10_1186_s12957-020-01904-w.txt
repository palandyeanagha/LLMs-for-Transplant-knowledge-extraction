drainage in patients with hilar
cholangiocarcinoma: an updated meta￾analysis

Abstract
Background: The effect and safety of preoperative biliary drainage (PBD) in patients with perihilar
cholangiocarcinoma are still controversial; the aim of our study is to evaluate all aspects of PBD.
Methods: All included studies featured PBD versus non-PBD (NPBD) groups were from 1996 to 2019 and were
extracted from Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, and Science Citation Index Expanded.
Results: Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in this analysis. PBD may lead to a significantly
higher incidence of overall morbidities (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53, 0.85; P = 0.0009) and intraoperative transfusions (OR
0.72, 95% CI 0.55, 0.94; P = 0.02); moreover, bile leakage (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.24, 1.41; P = 0.04), infection (OR 0.31,
95% CI 0.20, 0.47; P < 0.00001), and cholangitis (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.007, 0.48; P = 0.0007) are also related to PBD.
However, NPBD was associated with more frequent hepatic insufficiency (OR 3.09, 95% CI 1.15, 8.31; P = 0.03). In the
subgroup meta-analysis, the differences in the outcomes of bile leakage and overall morbidity lost significance
between the PBD and NPBD groups when the mean total serum bilirubin (TSB) concentration was above 15 mg/dl.
Conclusion: Meta-analysis demonstrated that compared to NPBD, PBD is associated with a greater risk of several
kinds of infection and morbidities, but its ability to reduce postoperative hepatic insufficiency cannot be ignored. In
patients with a high TSB concentration, PBD tends to be a better choice. However, these results need to be
confirmed in a future prospective randomized trial with large samples to clarify the effects and find a specific TSB
concentration for PBD.

Introduction
Hilar cholangiocarcinoma (hCCA), which is also known
as a Klatskin tumor, is the most prevalent type of all car￾cinomas related to bile ducts (accounting for 50–60%)
[1–3]. hCCA that arises in the proximal extrahepatic
epithelium of the bile ducts involving the right and left
main hepatic ducts is defined as cholangiocarcinoma.
Currently, the only curative treatment for hCCA is sur￾gery that includes extrahepatic bile duct resection, prob￾ably with major hepatic resection and potential
hepatoduodenal lymphadenectomy [1–4]. However, the
majority of patients with hCCA have no typical symp￾toms until hCCA progresses enough to obstruct the bile
ducts and lead to jaundice, which always presents as the
first symptom. Unfortunately, according to several

studies, patients with jaundice may experience infec￾tions, postoperative hepatic insufficiency, intraoperative
blood loss, and renal insufficiency [4–8], and preopera￾tive biliary drainage (PBD) is regarded as a practical so￾lution to reduce the total serum bilirubin (TSB)
concentration. However, patients who undergo PBD,
mainly by percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage
(PTBD) and endoscopic nasobiliary drainage (ENBD),
also have an increased risk for tumor seeding, extended
hospital stays, morbidities, and infections [1, 2, 9, 10].
Since a balance is needed between benefits and risks, the
indications for PBD are still under debate.
In view of this debate, Celotti et al. [11] previously col￾lected nine studies to conduct a meta-analysis of eight
kinds of morbidities. However, the number of studies in￾cluded was small, and several studies that can meet the
inclusion criterion have been published in recent years.
Moreover, the debate between PBD versus non-PBD
(NPBD) for different TSB concentrations also needs to
be clarified with a subgroup analysis. Thus, we con￾ducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to fully
evaluate the safety and effect of PBD in patients with
hCCA.
Materials and methods
Literature search
The work has been reported in line with the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta￾analyses (PRISMA) and Assessing the Methodological
Quality of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) guidelines. A
systematic literature search was conducted in the
Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, and Science
Citation Index Expanded to identify and retrieve studies
published from January 1995 to December 2019 related
to the evaluation of PBD in treating hCCA patients. The
following concrete search method was used:
Search(((PBD[Title/Abstract]) OR drainage[Title/Ab￾stract])) AND (((bile duct cancer[Title/Abstract]) OR
*Cholangiocarcinoma*[Title/Abstract]) OR *Klatskin*[-
Title/Abstract]). The language of the articles was limited
in English. The references of each selected study were
screened for any relevant articles that could be included.
Study selection
We set the following inclusion and exclusion criteria for
the literature we found. The inclusion criteria were as
follows: (1) published in English, (2) was human re￾search, (3) included patients with hilar cholangiocarci￾noma, and (4) compared PBD versus NPBD; if the same
institution (and authors) published multiple studies, the
study with either a higher quality or larger sample size
was included. Studies were excluded based on the fol￾lowing criteria: (1) letters, editorials, expert opinions,
abstracts, and case reports; and (2) duplicate patient
populations.
Qualitative assessment of the studies selected
The risk of bias in the included non-randomized studies
was evaluated according to the risk of bias in non￾randomized studies of interventions (ROBINS-1) tool [12].
Data extraction and synthesis
Each study was screened and evaluated by two investiga￾tors independently (Fei Teng and You-yin Tang) for a
decision regarding exclusion from the review. If dis￾agreements between the reviewers occurred, a third re￾viewer (Yongkun Li) was consulted. Two investigators
separately collected data from every study included with
standardized forms. The patients’ basic characteristics,
quality assessments, intraoperative outcomes, and post￾operative outcomes were included. The means and
standard deviations were used for continuous variable
meta-analysis unless otherwise mentioned. If the means
and standard deviations were impossible to access with
the median, range, and large sample size provided, we
used Hozo’s method [13] to approximately estimate the
mean and standard deviation.
We extracted the following data from each study: au￾thor, year, country, study duration, study design, number
of patients in the PBD and NPBD groups, age, sex, body
mass index (BMI), TSB before drainage in the PBD
groups, preoperative TSB in the NPBD groups, Bismuth
classification of the PBD and NPBD groups, mortality,
morbidity, hepatic insufficiency, renal insufficiency, R0
resection, operation time (min), need for intraoperative
transfusion, and incidence of bile leakage, infection,
cholangitis, intra-abdominal abscess, abdominal collec￾tion, anastomotic leakage, and second laparotomy.
Outcomes of interest and definitions
PBD was defined as an approach to reduce serum
bilirubin levels before the operation by PTBD or
ENBD. The primary outcomes were mortality, which
was defined as death occurring within 90 days from
admission to the hospital, and morbidity, which was
defined as any complication that occurred during
hospitalization or within 90 days after surgery. The
secondary outcomes included hepatic insufficiency,
renal insufficiency, R0 resection, operation time (min),
intraoperative transfusion, bile leakage, infection, chol￾angitis, intra-abdominal abscess, anastomotic leakage,
and second laparotomy. Hepatic insufficiency was de￾fined by a standard definition [14]. Renal insufficiency
was defined as any decrease in glomerular filtration
rate with no reversion to the preoperative level. R0
resection was defined as curative treatment when the
resection margin was free of tumor cells according to
Teng et al. World Journal of Surgical Oncology (2020) 18:174 Page 2 of 12

microscopy. Operation time was defined as the inter￾val from incision to suturing of the skin. Intraopera￾tive transfusion was defined as a blood transfusion of
at least 1 unit during the operation. Blood loss was
defined as aby blood loss during surgery. Infectious
complications were defined according to the study by
Hochwald et al. [15] and included infection, intra￾abdominal abscess, and cholangitis. Bile leakage was
defined as at least 50 ml of bile drained from the sur￾gical drainage tube or from the drainage of an ab￾dominal collection over a period of 3 days or more
[16]. Abdominal collection was defined as a collection
of fluid in the abdomen after surgery. Anastomotic
leakage was defined according to Dindo D’s [17] clas￾sification of complications. Second laparotomy was
defined as an operation for any curative reason after
the previous surgical resection.
Statistical analysis
A meta-analysis was performed using the Review
Manager version 5.3 software (The Cochrane Collabor￾ation, Oxford, UK). For each outcome, P < 0.05 was con￾sidered statistically significant. Continuous variables are
expressed as weighted mean differences (WMDs) and
odds ratios (ORs) for comparisons, and their corre￾sponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are reported.
Categorical variables are reported as ORs with their cor￾responding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A chi-square
test was used to evaluate heterogeneity, with P < 0.1
considered significant. The I
2 value was used to evaluate
statistical heterogeneity, and a value of 50% or more in￾dicated the presence of heterogeneity [18]. The fixed￾effects model was preferred for all outcomes, but if the
test rejected the assumption of homogeneity (I
2 > 50%
and heterogeneity P > 0.05), we chose the random￾effects model. We also performed a sensitivity analysis
for every single study included to determine the source
of heterogeneity. For every outcome we measured, we
performed a funnel plot to evaluate potential publication
bias.
Results
Description of the included studies
We reported this systematic review in accordance with
the PRISMA statement [19]. A flow diagram of the
search process for studies is shown in Fig. 1. In total,
3625 studies were identified from the electronic data￾bases we mentioned, and 2539 studies were removed
due to duplicate publications. Finally, only 40 studies
were fully screened for eligibility; however, for many rea￾sons, 23 studies were excluded, and only 17 studies were
included in our research. Unfortunately, the study con￾ducted by Figueras et al. [20] was excluded after a dis￾cussion among our group because of missing data. Thus,
16 studies with 1860 (NPBD, 775 patients; PBD, 1085
patients) patients were included in the meta-analysis
[21–36]. Because all of the included studies were retro￾spective comparative studies, the bias outcomes we mea￾sured with the ROBINS-I tool are shown in Table 1.
Some studies were considered to have a serious risk of
bias [22, 27, 28, 32, 34, 35]; some studies were consid￾ered to have a moderate risk of bias [25, 26, 30, 31, 33,
36], and some studies were considered to have a low risk
of bias [21, 23, 24]. The characteristics of the included
patients are shown in Table 2. The basic perioperative
and hilar cholangiocarcinoma data are shown in Tables
3 and 4; the results of the meta-analysis are shown in
Table 5; the results of the subgroup meta-analysis are
shown in Fig. 2; the publication bias measured by the
funnel plot is shown in Fig. 3, and the forest diagrams
are updated in supplied materials.
Results of the meta-analysis
After a common meta-analysis, to evaluate the effects of
PBD among different preoperative TSB levels in patients
with hCCA, the included studies were divided into two
subgroups: TSB < 10 mg/dl before PBD [21, 23, 25, 26,
30], and TSB > 15 mg/dl before PBD [24, 29, 31, 33, 36].
However, the outcomes presented only statistically sig￾nificant differences in morbidity and bile leakage be￾tween subgroups.
Primary outcomes
The mortality rate was reported in all 16 studies
[21–36], with no statistically significant difference ob￾served between NPBD and PBD (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.64,
1.30; P = 0.62). The outcome of morbidity was reported
in 12 studies [23–25, 27–33, 35, 36], with a significant
difference observed between groups; this result showed
that PBD may lead to more morbidities (OR 0.67, 95%
CI 0.53, 0.85; P = 0.0009).
Secondary outcomes
Hepatic insufficiency was reported in 8 studies [22,
24–27, 30, 33, 36], and the NPBD group had a signifi￾cantly higher risk of suffering from hepatic insufficiency
than the PBD group (OR 3.09, 95% CI 1.15, 8.31; P =
0.03). Renal insufficiency was reported in 4 studies [24,
31, 33, 36], and no significant difference was observed
between groups (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.40, 2.84; P = 0.89).
Intraoperative transfusion was reported in 7 studies [21,
23–27, 33], and the PBD group had a significantly higher
risk of requiring intraoperative transfusions (OR 0.72,
95% CI 0.55, 0.94; P = 0.02). The PBD group had a sig￾nificantly higher incidence of bile leakage according to
the outcomes of 6 studies [23, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36] (OR
0.58, 95% CI 0.24, 1.41; P = 0.04). The proportion of
positive surgical margins was reported in 5 studies [21,
Teng et al. World Journal of Surgical Oncology (2020) 18:174 Page 3 of 12

23, 29, 30, 36], and there was no statistically significant
difference between groups (OR 1.36, 95% CI 0.93, 1.96;
P = 0.11).
Infection was significantly more likely to occur in the
PBD group than in the NPBD group, based on the out￾comes of 8 studies [23–27, 31, 33, 36] (OR 0.31, 95% CI
0.20, 0.47; P < 0.00001). Cholangitis was reported in only
3 studies [24, 27, 30], and the PBD group had a signifi￾cantly higher risk of cholangitis (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.007,
0.48; P = 0.0007). Intra-abdominal abscess was reported
in 5 studies [23–25, 27, 36], without a statistically signifi￾cant difference between groups (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.22,
1.32; P = 0.07). Intraoperative blood loss was reported in
5 studies [21, 23, 24, 30, 36], without a statistically sig￾nificant difference between groups (WMD 32.34, 95% CI
375.83, 440.51; P = 0.88). The operation time was re￾ported in 5 studies [21, 25, 26, 30, 33], without a statisti￾cally significant difference between groups (WMD −
63.21, 95% CI − 156.16, 29.73; P = 0.18). Second laparot￾omy was reported in 4 studies [21, 24, 26, 27], without a
statistically significant difference between groups (OR
1.37, 95% CI 0.52, 3.63; P = 0.53). Anastomotic leakage
was only reported in 3 studies [23, 24, 31], without a sta￾tistically significant difference between groups (OR 0.55,
95% CI 0.15, 2.10; P = 0.38). Abdominal collection was
reported in 3 studies [24, 27, 36], without a statistically
significant difference between groups (OR 0.9, 95% CI
0.4, 2.00; P = 0.79).
Subgroup meta-analysis
All studies were divided into low TSB concentrations (<
10 mg/dl) [21, 23, 25, 26, 27] and high TSB concentrations
(> 15 mg/dl) [24, 29, 31, 33, 36] according to the mean
TSB concentration. All of the primary outcomes and sec￾ondary outcomes mentioned were analyzed, but statisti￾cally significant differences were only observed in overall

0.22, 1.00, P = 0.05; high TSB concentration: OR = 0.81,
95% CI 0.50, 1.30, P = 0.38) and bile leakage (low TSB

high TSB concentration: OR = 0.92, 95% CI 0.27, 3.12, P =
0.90).
Sensitivity analysis
We conducted a sensitivity analysis on every study in￾cluded by changing the type of effects model or ex￾cluding individual studies from the outcomes analysis.
No results changed when the effect model was simply
switched to another model. Although high heterogen￾eity existed in the outcomes of intraoperative blood
loss, hepatic insufficiency, and operation time, the
outcomes were stable, with no meaningful or signifi￾cant changes when the effect model was changed.
There was high heterogeneity for liver insufficiency;
however, the heterogeneity was zero when Dario’s
study [30] was excluded.
Discussion
For several years, jaundice after hepatectomy was
regarded as an incident related to hepatic insufficiency
or even hepatic failure; moreover, the main reason for
death after liver surgery was hepatic failure [37]. In fact,
the mechanisms of liver failure caused by hyperbilirubi￾nemia have already been demonstrated in animal experi￾ments, and cholestasis makes the liver more susceptible
to ischemia, reperfusion drainage, and inflammation,
likely because of a reduction in antioxidant ability and a
stronger response to inflammation [38]. However, the
routine use of PBD in hCCA is still controversial in clin￾ical practice.
Many experts and researchers from Western coun￾tries and Japan suggested the routine use of PBD be￾fore surgery in hCCA patients [22, 39–41] due to its

effects in reducing liver insufficiency. However, the
most recent opinion that PBD could not improve the
primary outcomes of hCCA patients was suggested by
Wronka [26] and Zhang et al. [23], who worried
about the complications associated with PBD, includ￾ing tumor seeding, cholangitis, inflammation, and
additional infections. The aim of PBD is to increase
liver tolerance to ischemia and reduce intraoperative
blood loss [42], and several studies have already dem￾onstrated the significance of PBD [43–45]. However,
most of these studies showed benefits without report￾ing specific characteristics, such as tumor size, con￾centration of serum bilirubin, liver remnant volume,
preoperative complications, and Bismuth classification,
so the standard of how and when to use PBD in pa￾tients with hCCA is still not clear. In many medical
care centers, doctors develop their own suggestion for
conducting PBD regarding preoperative TSB concen￾tration: Nimura et al. [46] and Makuuchi et al. [47]
suggested PBD at a bilirubin cut-off of 3 mg/dl to
minimize the occurrence of complications, and Hem￾ming et al. [37] preferred 5 mg/dl of TSB for PBD.
However, Su et al. [28] and Ercolani et al. [34] sug￾gested that when the TSB concentration exceeded 10
mg/dl, the operation should be delayed, and PBD was
required. However, whether PBD with the aim of
decreasing the TSB concentration surely improves
liver tolerance to perioperative inflammation and is￾chemia, while considering the increased incidence of
tumor seeding, infection, cholangitis, etc., and how to
balance the benefits and risks are still unclear.
Regarding the primary outcomes, no statistically sig￾nificant difference in mortality was found between the
PBD and NPBD groups; however, the overall morbid￾ity rate was higher in the PBD group. Interestingly,
the overall morbidity rate changed when the studies
were divided into the low and high TSB concentra￾tion groups. In the low TSB concentration group, the
OR was 0.47, with a statistically significant difference
between PBD and NPBD; the OR in the high concen￾tration group reached 0.81, without a statistically sig￾nificant difference between PBD and NPBD. At lower
TSB concentrations, PBD might increase the risk of
infection in the bile duct system [48]; however, as the
concentration of TSB increases, liver function is im￾paired, and the NPBD patient with severe jaundice
who underwent surgery may bare more risk for
morbidities.
We performed the subgroup analysis based on biliru￾bin less than 10 mg/ml and greater than 15 mg/ml in the
preoperative NPBD group; however, it is undeniable that
even in the low concentration group, there may be a

very few patients with more than 15 mg/ml of high con￾centration group with lower preoperative TSB concen￾tration. Therefore, the results of the subgroup analysis
are very conservative and can only be used as a reference
for future related research directions. The difference be￾tween the low and high TSB concentration groups most
likely indicates that there was a reasonable concentration
of TSB for hCCA patients that motivated the decision to
perform PBD.
Regarding the secondary outcomes, no statistically
significant difference was observed in renal insuffi￾ciency, positive surgical margin, intra-abdominal
abscess, intraoperative blood loss, operation time, sec￾ond laparotomy, anastomotic leakage, or abdominal
collection between the two groups. In contrast, statis￾tically significant differences were found in hepatic
insufficiency, intraoperative transfusion, bile leakage,
infection, and cholangitis.
Interestingly, all of the outcomes with a statistically
significant difference were consistent with the fact that
the NPBD group might have a lower risk of developing
infectious complications and requiring intraoperative
transfusions. Stents in the bile duct system surely led to
a higher infection rate (cholangitis, infection, intra￾Table 4 Operative data of overall complications

abdominal abscess), which may lead to a higher mortal￾ity rate, especially when the liver remnant function
(FLR) is < 30% [30].
On the other hand, PBD decreased the hepatic in￾sufficiency rate but to the same degree in both the
low and high TSB concentration groups; this was
likely caused by the approximately same short dur￾ation of high TSB poisoning when the different con￾centrations of TSB increase according to the degree
of obstruction. In the subgroup analysis of bile leak￾age, similar to that of overall morbidity, within the
low TSB concentration group, the NPBD group had a
significantly lower risk of bile leakage (OR = 0.36),
while in the high TSB concentration group, the OR
changed to 0.92, and the difference lost significance.
On the one hand, this confusing conclusion may be
caused by the small number of studies (only two
studies) in the high TSB concentration group. On the
other hand, PBD had already injured the bile duct
physically or by infection; thus, when the concentra￾tion of TSB increased, the cicatrization after surgery
slowed down, and the liver tended to be more sus￾ceptible to inflammation [28, 49].
Currently, several studies have discussed whether
PBD can be performed for hCCA patients with differ￾ent conditions. Wiggers et al. [49] and Kennedy et al.
[22] showed that patients with an FLR < 30% who
underwent PBD could achieve a significantly reduced
hepatic insufficiency rate (33% versus 0%, PBD versus
NPBD) and mortality rate (33% versus 0%, PBD ver￾sus NPBD); however, in patients with an FLR > 30%,
PBD was not superior to NPBD in reducing the hep￾atic insufficiency rate (0% versus 0%) or mortality rate
(0% versus 9.1%, NPBD versus PBD). Wronka et al.
[26] claimed that PBD was not necessary if hCCA pa￾tients had a TSB concentration > 6.2 mg/dl or > 2.50
mg/dl with preoperative hypoalbuminemia, anemia, or
renal dysfunction.
According to our meta-analysis outcomes, PBD was
not suitable for patients with hCCA because of the in￾creased risk of bile leakage, cholangitis, infection, intra￾operative transfusion, and overall morbidity. However,
patients with hCCA and a TSB concentration > 15 mg/
dl may still tend to undergo PBD rather than NPBD due
to the lower mortality rate of PBD, especially in patients
with a low FLR.
Moreover, clinical hCCA patients may suffer other dis￾eases or conditions (hypoalbuminemia, anemia, renal dys￾function, renal failure, low immune function, etc.), and the
benefits and risks of PBD should be evaluated separately
to meet a standard. Nevertheless, high-quality retrospect￾ive studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are
required to draw definitive guidelines for hCCA patients
with different conditions.

The meta-analysis still has some limitations. First, the
subgroups were roughly divided by the mean TSB of
each study (< 10 mg/dl and > 15 mg/dl). Although we
communicated with the authors of the studies to acquire
the primary data and widened the TSB difference be￾tween the two groups (< 10 mg/dl and > 15 mg/dl), it
was still difficult to obtain fully convincing subgroup
outcomes. Second, all of the studies were retrospective
studies, which could lead to inevitable selection bias.
Third, the studies by Su et al. [28] and Gerhards et al.
[35] date back to 1996 and 1999 and perhaps apply dif￾ferent surgical techniques that might influence the re￾sults. Fourth, the drainage types included ENBD and
PTBD, which were not mentioned in most of the studies
included. Therefore, it is difficult for us to evaluate the
bias due to the proportion of ENBD and PTBD proce￾dures performed, although no large differences seemed
to be observed.
Conclusion
The meta-analysis demonstrated that PBD is related to a
greater risk of several kinds of infections and morbidities
than NPBD, but the ability of PBD to reduce postopera￾tive hepatic insufficiency cannot be ignored. In patients
with a high TSB concentration, PBD tends to be a better
choice. Nonetheless, these results need to be confirmed
