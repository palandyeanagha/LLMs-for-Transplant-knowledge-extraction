Abstract
Objective-To investigate the relation
between Helicobacter pylon infection and
coronary heart disease (CHD).
Design-A case-control study.
Setting-Northern Finland (about 650 000
inhabitants).
Patients-116 patients with angiographi￾cally documented CHD and 116 controls
matched for age and gender randomly
recruited from the register of the Finnish
Social Insurance Institute.
Main outcome measures-The odds ratio
(OR) estimates for the association of H
pylon infection with CHD.
Results-64% of the CHD patients and
53% of the controls were seropositive for
H pylon; the OR adjusted for age and
gender was 1'5 (95% confidence interval
(CI) 0-9 to 2.5). An additional adjustment
for the common risk factors of CHD,
including lipid concentrations, in a logis￾tic regression analysis produced an OR
estimate of 1*1 (95% CI 0-6 to 2.1). Among
the controls, those who were Hpyloni pos￾itive had significantly (P = 0-03) higher
concentrations of serum triglycerides
than those who were H pylon negative:
the trend among the cases was similar,
but non-significant. The concentrations
of HDL cholesterol tended to be lower in
those who were H pylon positive than in
those who were Hpylon negative, among
both the cases and the controls.
Conclusions-The impact of H pyloni
infection as an independent risk factor for
CHD seems to be minor. On the other
hand the results are consistent with the
hypothesis that H pyloni infection might
modify the serum lipid concentrations in
a way that could increase the risk of CHD.

Helicobacter pylori infection and coronary heart
disease (CHD) are common conditions in late
middle and old age. Hpylori usually causes a
lifelong infection of the gastric mucosa.' In
addition, Hpylori has been shown to cause sys￾temic responses related to CHD.2-5 Hpylori is a
major cause of gastric ulcer disease, which
coincides with CHD more frequently than
expected.6 Recently, H pylori infection turned
out to be associated with CHD in cross sec￾tional studies.47 The prevalence of H pylori
infection is dependent on the population stud￾ied,' and the results of the studies may be con￾founded by other risk factors for CHD and H
pylori infection.' 8 We investigated the associa￾tion of Hpylori infection with CHD in a case￾control study by comparing a group of patients
with angiographically documented CHD and
a group of controls with a similar age and gen￾der distribution.
Patients and methods
The case series originally consisted of 138
consecutive patients referred to the
Department of Internal Medicine, Oulu
University Hospital, Finland, for elective coro￾nary angiography because of suspected CHD.
The catchment area comprised Northern
Finland, which has about 650 000 inhabitants.
We excluded one patient without a serum
sample for serological determination of H
pylori and 21 on lipid-lowering medication.
We studied 116 patients (96 men, 20 women,
aged 35-65 years, median 54 years) with
angiographically documented coronary artery
disease and 116 people (aged 40-59 years,
median 52 years) randomly recruited from the
register of the Finnish Social Insurance
Institute covering the population of Oulu, the
biggest city in the area, and matched for age
and gender with the cases. The controls had
not needed medical treatment for hyperten￾sion.
The frozen sera of the patients and the con￾trols were simultaneously investigated for IgG
antibodies to H pylori by an enzyme linked
immunosorbent assay (Pyloriset, Orion
Diagnostica, Espoo, Finland) by one of the
authors (RK) who was blind to the disease sta￾tus. Titres > 500 were regarded as positive (a
specificity and sensitivity of 95%9). Fasting
serum total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and
total triglycerides were also measured. The
patients and the controls were interviewed
about their history of diabetes and smoking
habits. The controls were also asked about
their possible history of CHD. Selective coro￾nary angiography was performed on the
patients using the Judkins method and
analysed according to the clinical routine of
the hospital. A narrowing of the luminal
dimensions of 50% or more was defined as a
significant lesion. The patients were defined as
having one, two, or three vessel disease,
according to the number of arteries affected.

negative individuals were compared in the
control group, excluding those with a history
of diabetes or some evidence of CHD and
adjusting for age, gender, and history of smok￾ing (current v ex- and never-smokers) by the
analysis of covariance. A similar analysis was
performed on the CHD patients. The odds
ratio (OR) for the relative risk of CHD associ￾ated with the Hpylori infection was estimated
by the logistic regression model, adjusting by
forward steps for age and gender; the history
of smoking and diabetes; and total cholesterol,
triglycerides and HDL cholesterol. Each lipid
variable was divided into tertiles according to
the distribution of values in the whole study
group. We also analysed the data by compar￾ing the patients with two or three vessel dis￾ease with the control group and by excluding
the subjects with some evidence of CHD from
the control group. The statistical analyses
were performed using the SAS program (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Compared with the control group, the CHD
patients had higher serum concentrations of
total cholesterol and total triglycerides and
lower serum concentrations of HDL choles￾terol and were more often diabetic and ever￾smokers (table 1). In the control group, after
adjustment for the effect of age, gender, and
smoking by the analysis of covariance, those
who were H pylori positive had higher serum
concentrations of triglycerides (P = 003) and
lower HDL cholesterol (P = 0 19) than those
who were not. Findings in the CHD patients
were similar (P = 0-18 and P = 0 18, respec￾tively).
Seventy four (64%) cases and 62 (53%)
controls were H pylori positive. The propor￾tion of Hpylori-positive individuals was higher
among the cases with two or three vessel dis￾ease (51/74, 69%) than in the other CHD
patients (23/42, 55%). The results of logistic

regression modelling (table 2) indicated that
the CHD status was associated, though not
significantly, with H pylori positivity when
adjusted for age and gender only (OR = 1 5).
However, when further adjustments where
made for diabetes, smoking, total cholesterol
and triglycerides, the association became
weaker (OR = 1X3) and almost disappeared
after adjustment for HDL cholesterol (OR =
1 1). The relative risks were higher when the
patients with two or three vessel disease were
compared with the control group, but even
then the association was fairly weak after
adjustment for all of the above determinants
and the confidence interval was wide. The
results were similar when the analyses were
performed by excluding the subjects with any
evidence of CHD from the control group.
Discussion
Our CHD patients, especially those with two
or three vessel diseases, were more often H
pylori seropositive than the non-diseased con￾trols. Apart from the large random variation,
the estimated odds ratios may be biased by the
selection of the controls and the cross sec￾tional study design. Our controls were repre￾sentative of the source population of the cases,
but the exclusion of the patients with obvious
hypertensive disease reduced their risk of
CHD. We found that 53% of our controls
were seropositive for H pylori, which accords
with the previously reported seroprevalences
of 39-60% among the Finnish blood donors
aged 36-65 years.'0 Some misclassification of
infection status is likely. This will affect all the
groups and hence tend to reduce the relative
risk estimates towards 1.
In the present study, the adjustment for the
conventional risk factors, especially the serum
HDL cholesterol concentration, reduced the
estimated relative risk of CHD associated with
Hpylori positivity. In a recent study of 47 sub￾jects with electrocardiographic evidence of
myocardial ischaemia or infarction and 341
controls, H pyloni infection was significantly
associated with CHD, and the relation could
not be explained by the risk factors of CHD
including history of hyperlipidaemia.4 How￾ever, the data also suggest a negative, although
not statistically significant, effect of H pylori
positivity on plasma apolipoprotein A concen￾tration (reflecting HDL cholesterol concentra￾tion) and a positive effect on triglyceride
concentration.4 Another recent study reported a
weak negative association between H pylori
infection and HDL-cholesterol."I In addition,

Could Helicobacter pylori infection increase the risk of coronary heart disease by modifying serum lipid concentrations?
acute infections have been shown to reduce
the serum HDL cholesterol concentration and
increase the serum triglyceride concentra￾tion." In our study the similar trend observed
both in the CHD patients and in the controls
suggests that Hpylori may modify serum lipid
concentrations. If this is true and the effect of H
pylori infection on the risk of CHD is mediated
by HDL cholesterol and triglyceride concen￾trations, then these lipid variables should not
be adjusted when the effect of Hpylori on the
disease is assessed. If, however, Hpylori infec￾tion does not affect serum HDL cholesterol or
triglyceride concentrations, these variables
would be ordinary confounders and should be
adjusted for. We analysed the data both with￾out and with these adjustments and present
the appropriate results for the alternative theo￾ries about the role of HDL cholesterol and
triglycerides.
H pylori infection and CHD may have
shared risk factors, because low socioeco￾nomic status in childhood may predispose to
both conditions.' 8 We did not have this infor￾mation for those in our study. In the British
study, adjustment for the features of current
and childhood socioeconomic conditions only
slightly reduced the effect of Hpylori seroposi￾tivity on the risk of CHD7 and a recent study
concluded that the social class was associated
with CHD independently of H pylori infec￾tion."I
The present results indicate that after
adjustment for some known key determinants
of CHD, Hpylori infection has little impact as
an independent risk factor for CHD. How￾ever, the confidence intervals were wide leav￾ing room for the possibility that Hpylori could
have a moderate effect on the risk of CHD.
Also the data are consistent with the hypothesis
that Hpylori may modify serum lipid concen￾trations in a way that may increase the risk of
CHD. A longitudinal study with treatment
intervention and with more expected cases
would be needed to examine the causal rela￾tions between these associations.
