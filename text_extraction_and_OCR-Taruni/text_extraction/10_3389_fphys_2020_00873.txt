Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are the most abundant non-parenchymal
cells lining the sinusoidal capillaries of the hepatic system. LSECs are characterized
with numerous fenestrae and lack basement membrane as well as a diaphragm.
These unique morphological characteristics of LSECs makes them the most permeable
endothelial cells of the mammalian vasculature and aid in regulating flow of
macromolecules and small lipid-based structures between sinusoidal blood and
parenchymal cells. LSECs have a very high endocytic capacity aided by scavenger
receptors (SR), such as SR-A, SR-B (SR-B1 and CD-36), SR-E (Lox-1 and mannose
receptors), and SR-H (Stabilins). Other high-affinity receptors for mediating endocytosis
include the FcγRIIb, which assist in the antibody-mediated removal of immune
complexes. Complemented with intense lysosomal activity, LSECs play a vital role in
the uptake and degradation of many blood borne waste macromolecules and small
(<280 nm) colloids. Currently, seven Toll-like receptors have been investigated in LSECs,
which are involved in the recognition and clearance of pathogen-associated molecular
pattern (PAMPs) as well as damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP). Along with
other SRs, LSECs play an essential role in maintaining lipid homeostasis with the low￾density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1), in juxtaposition with hepatocytes.
LSECs co-express two surface lectins called L-Specific Intercellular adhesion molecule￾3 Grabbing Non-integrin Receptor (L-SIGN) and liver sinusoidal endothelial cell lectin
(LSECtin). LSECs also express several adhesion molecules which are involved in the
recruitment of leukocytes at the site of inflammation. Here, we review these cell surface
receptors as well as other components expressed by LSECs and their functions in
the maintenance of liver homeostasis. We further discuss receptor expression and
activity and dysregulation associated with the initiation and progression of many liver
diseases, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, liver fibrosis, and cirrhosis, alcoholic and
non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases and pseudocapillarization with aging.

Pandey et al. LSEC Receptors
INTRODUCTION
The liver is considered a crucial organ of the body due to
its involvement in numerous processes, such as metabolism,
immunity, detoxification, nutrient storage, among others.
The liver is composed primarily of four distinct cell types,
differentiated into two categories as parenchymal cells (PC,
60–80%) and non-parenchymal cells (NPC 20–40%). The
NPC population is composed of liver sinusoidal endothelial
cells/LSECs (50%), Kupffer cells/KCs (20%) and stellate cells
(<1%). The remaining NPCs are composed of lymphocytes
(25%) and biliary cells (5%) (Racanelli and Rehermann, 2006).
The role of hepatocytes, KCs and stellate cells in maintaining
liver homeostasis is well documented. However, the LSEC, is the
most understudied due to technical challenges in purification and
culturing ex vivo.
Prof. Eddie Wisse first proposed the ultrastructure of liver
sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) in 1970, which differentiated
LSECs from KCs and paved the way for future study on LSECs
and elucidation of their function (Wisse, 1970, 1972). A few
years later, several research groups developed LSEC isolation
techniques and identified their role in the uptake of various
substances in vitro (Seglen, 1976; Smedsrod et al., 1984). In
the early 1980s, LSECs were identified as a significant clearance
site for blood-borne hyaluronan, which established their role
as scavenger cells (Fraser et al., 1981). This led to an increase
in interest among scientists from other discipline, such as
immunology, virology, cancer, and more to further comprehend
the various roles performed by LSECs. This review focuses
on the detailed description of LSEC morphology and their
scavenger, adhesion and other prominent receptors that define
their functional roles in the hematological and hepatic systems
during health and disease.
LSEC MORPHOLOGY
Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) form the inner lining
of liver sinusoidal blood vessels or capillary bed which serves as
the site for mixing nutrient-rich blood from the hepatic portal
vein and oxygen-rich blood from the hepatic artery (Sorensen
et al., 2015). Here, the LSECs assist in clearing macromolecular
waste (extracellular matrix material and foreign molecules) from
the blood and regulate hepatic vascularity. Individual LSEC’s
are flat and very small in size, no thicker than 5 µm at the
center and 0.3 µm at the periphery (Wisse, 1970, 1972; Smedsrod
et al., 1988b; Falkowska-Hansen et al., 2007). Cytoplasmic
projections, such as filopodia, lamellipodia, and microvilli are
absent in LSECs, giving them a smooth appearance. LSECs
contain numerous fenestrae (small open pores) that facilitate
the selective exchange of molecules between the blood and
underlying stellate and hepatocytes (Wisse et al., 1985; Braet
and Wisse, 2002). Fenestrae are located in the cytoplasm of
LSECs and usually are 50–200 nm in diameter and organized
in groups known as sieve plates (Wisse et al., 1985). They are
also distributed individually on the surface of endothelium or
organized in a labyrinth or mesh-like structure (Taira, 1994;
Braet et al., 2007, 2009; Figure 1). LSECs do not have a basement
membrane or basal lamina and diaphragm, permitting direct
access of solutes to the perisinusoidal space or the Space of
Disse. The lack of a basal lamina has also been identified in
several animals, such as chickens and bony fish (Fraser et al.,
1986; Eng and Youson, 1992). The Space of Disse hosts the
stellate cells as well as hepatocyte microvilli. During fibrosis
or chronic inflammation, activated stellate cells contribute to
the deposition of extracellular matrix in the Space of Disse,
forming a continuous basal membrane. This new basal lamina
is mostly composed of collagen that inhibits the permeability of
the Space of Disse and reduces the solute exchange between the
parenchyma and blood (Han et al., 2001; Mak et al., 2012).
LSEC’s are unique because of their plentiful fenestrae. The
LSEC fenestrae can change their diameter in response to the
cellular environment (Wisse et al., 1996; Braet and Wisse, 2002).
The mechanism for fenestral contraction and dilation was
first discovered by researchers in the 1980s and is now
known as a dynamic process (Monkemoller et al., 2015;
Zapotoczny et al., 2019). Fenestrae is surrounded by actin
filaments, suggesting the role of cytoskeleton is central in
the formation and maintenance of fenestrae. This idea was
further supported by several researchers in the successive years
as immunofluorescence microscopic study substantiated the
presence of actin, myosin, microtubule and calmodulin as
necessary in forming these structures (Wisse, 1970; Braet and
Wisse, 2002). Actin, myosin, and calmodulin influence the
diameter of each pore and determine how long it persists.
Serotonin has also been found to regulate contraction of fenestrae
by increasing the intracellular calcium concentration (Gatmaitan
et al., 1996; Yokomori, 2008; Furrer et al., 2011). Increase in the
thickness of LSECs, unexpected formation of basal lamina and
reduction in the number of pores is known as defenestration.
Defenestration of LSECs gives rise to pseudocapillarization, a
disorder evident in liver fibrosis, atherosclerosis and other aging
associated diseases (Le Couteur et al., 2001, 2007). Fenestrae
is maintained cooperatively by hepatocytes and stellate cells
mediated paracrine and autocrine signaling (DeLeve et al., 2004).
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VGEF), a hormone that
functions in blood vessel growth, promotes paracrine signaling
from hepatocytes and stellate cells stimulates autocrine signaling
of nitric oxide (NO) from LSECs. Animals lacking VEGF tend to
exhibit increased defenestration in their LSECs, suggesting that
this molecule plays a mechanistic role in either their formation
or maintenance (Kus et al., 2019).
Defenestrated LSECs results in the reduction of hepatic uptake
of lipoproteins and is one of the causes of hyperlipoproteinemia
(Fraser et al., 2012). Similarly, defenestration has also been
observed to play an important role in the progression of non￾alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Miyao et al. demonstrated
that since LSECs are a “gatekeeper” for the liver parenchyma,
their injury during early stages of NAFLD determines the severity
of subsequent injury and progression of NAFLD (Miyao et al.,
2015; Shetty et al., 2018). In the past few years, some of this
data has been called into question in that some have observed no
difference in NAFLD and fenestration levels of LSECs and that
LSECs have a more calming effect on injured hepatocytes and

activated stellate cells (Kus et al., 2019). This idea is reinforced
in a study of autoimmune hepatitis in which human LSECs
in biopsies from young people less than 20 years old were
assessed for damage and the formation of a basement membrane.
Defenestration did occur in about half of the subjects, but little to
no basement membrane formed in the Space of Disse suggesting
that LSECs have regenerative properties and may soften the
assault on the liver (Lotowska et al., 2018). While there was no
causative relationship proven, the jury is still out on whether
progressive NAFLD is associated with defenestration.
Another salient characteristic of LSECs that differentiate them
from other endothelial cells is their higher endocytic ability.
LSECs only make up about 3% of total liver volume, however,
they contribute to about 45% of pinocytic vesicles in the liver
(Blouin et al., 1977). A study was conducted to elucidate the
mechanism of cross presentation by LSECs as a link was found
between endocytosis and antigen presentation (Burgdorf et al.,
2008). This study reported that LSECs were most efficient at
internalizing circulating antigen in the blood as compared to
dendritic cells (DC) or macrophages of the spleen as well as
by KC and DC of the liver (Schurich et al., 2009). LSECs are
well equipped with high affinity endocytic scavenger receptors
and lysosomal activity that helps in the internalization and
catabolization of a large number of waste substances (Table 1) as
well as small colloidal particles (Knook and Sleyster, 1980; Juvet
et al., 1997; Kawai et al., 1998; Elvevold et al., 2008a).
Kjeken et al. (2001) showed that a clathrin-dependent
mechanism is used by LSECs for fluid phase endocytosis.
Furthermore, they found that LSECs have higher expression
of clathrin protein and twice the number of clathrin-coated
pits as compared to KC or hepatocytes. Several years later,
Falkowska-Hansen et al. (2007) reported an interesting finding
about clathrin-coated vesicles in primary rat LSECs. They
found that clathrin heavy chain (CHC) is distributed as net￾like structure which was unique to primary rat LSECs. They
also showed the co-localization of CHC with microtubules.
Furthermore, they found that clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV)
function is dependent on microtubules as disruption of
microtubules resulted in dysregulation of intracellular transport
as well as aberrant signaling of organelles involved in clathrin￾mediated endocytosis in LSECs (Falkowska-Hansen et al., 2007).
Experiments evaluating the endocytosis capacity of primary
LSECs in vitro must be performed the same day or within
24 h of purification of the LSECs. After this time period,
endocytosis sharply decreases and ceases altogether around
day 4 (Braet et al., 1994). Interestingly, the disappearance
of fenestrae takes place over the same time course (Braet
et al., 2005). To date, the record holder for maintaining
LSECs in culture with their native endocytic capacity is the
Smedsrod group using an animal-free medium which allowed
endocytosis to occur out to 30 days using a pig model (Elvevold
et al., 2005). It should be kept in mind that the study of
endocytosis in LSECs must be performed with the freshly
purified primary cells as no cell line to date expresses all of the
specialized receptors nor morphological features that make these
cells so dynamic.

RECENTLY ESTABLISHED
NOMENCLATURE FOR SCAVENGER
RECEPTORS
Scavenger receptors are defined as protein receptors that bind to
a broad range of ligands from exogenous sources (bacteria, yeast,
viruses) and modified endogenous sources [oxidized lipoprotein,
advanced glycation end (AGE) products, etc.]. In 2017, a
workshop was organized by the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health in the
United States to develop a clear definition of the various groups
of scavenger receptors known to date. This group categorized
the scavenger receptors in 11 different classes (A through L)
depending on their structure and function and clarified the
nomenclature of the various receptors (PrabhuDas et al., 2017).
This review will only discuss the role and function of scavenger
receptors in the liver sinusoids. LSECs are known to express
SR-A, two SR-B variants (SR-B1 and SR-B2/CD36), mannose
receptor/CD206/SR-E3, SR-H1 and SR-H2, FcγRIIb and others
under normal conditions (Table 1 and Figure 2). LSECs are also
known to express SR-E1 under various pathological conditions.
Here, an overview of LSEC scavenger receptors are presented.
Scavenger Receptor A (SR-A)
The class A scavenger receptors (also known as MSR1, SR￾AI, SCARA1) were first cloned by the Kreiger group (Kodama
et al., 1990; Rohrer et al., 1990) and may have been involved
with binding to modified low-density lipoproteins. Scavenger
receptor-A (SR-A) is a type II trimeric integral plasma membrane
receptor that is encoded on chromosome 8 in both humans
and mice. It is characterized by the following six domains: a
transmembrane region, a spacer region, a coiled-coil region,
a collagenous stretch of repeated Gly-X-P/K, an N-terminal
cytoplasmic tail, and a carboxyl terminal-type specific-domain
(Figure 2). Alternative splicing results in three variants of SR-A,
namely SR-A1.1 and SR-A1.2 (Emi et al., 1993). The structure of
the three isoforms are very similar and the differences lie in their
cysteine-rich carboxy terminal domain which is involved in cell
adhesion and, possibly, bacterial binding (Bowdish and Gordon,
2009; Yap et al., 2015). SR-A type-I is characterized with a cysteine
rich carboxy terminal domain whereas SR-A type-II has short
C-terminal domain lacking cysteine-rich site at the C-terminus
(Rohrer et al., 1990). SR-A type-III has a truncated cysteine￾rich domain (Gough et al., 1999). SR-A type1/1.1 are involved
in the binding of diverse macromolecules, such as acetylated
and oxidized low density lipoprotein (ac/oxLDL) (Suzuki et al.,
1997; Kunjathoor et al., 2002), β-amyloid fibrils (El Khoury et al.,
1996), AGE products (Araki et al., 1995), molecules present
on the surface of gram negative and positive bacteria, such as
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) (Dunne
et al., 1994). Rohrer et al. (1990) demonstrated that the fibrous
coiled-coil and collagen-like domains are responsible for binding
different ligands in SR-A type-1/1.1 as removal of cysteine-rich
C-terminal domain in SR-A type-II did not affect its binding
capacity. SR-A type-1.2 does not bind to SR-A type-1/1.1 ligands
but it has been shown to negatively regulate the functions of SR-A
type-1/1.1 in vitro (Gough et al., 1999).
SR-A expression was once thought to be only expressed in
macrophages/KCs, but recent work have shown their expression
in brain microglia and astrocytes, LSECs and vascular smooth
muscle cells (Nagelkerke et al., 1983; Hughes et al., 1995;
Christie et al., 1996; Gough et al., 1999; Godoy et al., 2012).
Work conducted in rats have shown that SR-A expressed on
LSECs are primarily responsible for carrying out the uptake of
the artificial ligand, acLDL, in liver (Nagelkerke et al., 1983).
They also theorized the role of an acLDL receptor present
on LSECs in the prevention of accumulation of cholesterol
under normal condition, though the pathways involved remain
elusive. Similarly, another report has demonstrated the uptake

of ac/oxLDL by two scavenger receptors; an unidentified
95 kDa protein and the likely candidates, SR-A1/1.1 present
on rat LSECs and KCs (De Rijke et al., 1992, 1994; De
Rijke and Van Berkel, 1994). In 1990, a commentary in
Nature written by Brown and Goldstein had attempted to
bring about a universal idea or theory involving the numerous
ligands including LDLs that bind to a few scavenger receptors,
of which SR-A was a very likely candidate (Brown and
Goldstein, 1990). Furthermore, several studies have shown
the elevated expression of SR-A in atherosclerotic lesions
(Matsumoto et al., 1990) and accumulation of oxLDL, a SR-A
ligand in plaques, suggesting it’s putative role in atherogenesis
(Hiltunen et al., 2001). SR-AI in LSEC is also involved
in uptake and degradation of malondialdehydes-acetaldehyde￾serum albumin (MAA), which is considered immunogenic
and capable of producing inflammatory responses in the liver
(Duryee et al., 2005). It has also been observed that chronic
ethanol administration diminishes the uptake of MAA by SR-A
in rats. This leads to the accumulation of acetaldehyde and
aldehyde modified protein adducts in the circulation. These
adducts cause secretion of monocyte chemoattractant protein
(MCP)-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2 via
hepatic stellate cells, contributing to alcoholic liver disease
(Kharbanda et al., 2001).
Despite all of the evidence that SR-A receptors were involved
with the uptake and catabolism of LDLs, the use of knock￾out mice in the late 1990’s demonstrated that the SR-A
receptors had a negligible effect on liver uptake and decay
of serum acLDL (Ling et al., 1997; Van Berkel et al., 1998).
Furthermore, SR-A1/1.1-deficient and wild type (WT) mice
were compared with the liver sequestration of other non￾parenchymal ligands, namely AGE, N-terminal propeptide of
type III procollagen (PIIINP) and formaldehyde-treated serum
albumin. The results indicated that the SR-A receptors were of
minor importance for plasma clearance of these ligands and
the distribution in other tissues and organs was not altered
(Hansen et al., 2002).
Scavenger Receptor B (SR-B)
Scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1/SCARB1) is a member
of scavenger receptor B, which is located on chromosome 12 in
humans and chromosome 5 in mice (Acton et al., 1994). SR-B1
is a membrane glycoprotein consisting of two short cytoplasmic
N- and C-terminal domains, two short hydrophobic membrane
regions, and a highly N-glycosylated large looped extracellular
domain (Krieger, 1999). They exist as two isoforms, SR-B1 and￾B1.1, resulting from alternative splicing (Webb et al., 1997).
CD36 and LIMPII Analogous (CLA-1) is the human homolog
of SR-B1 (Calvo and Vega, 1993). Liver and steroidogenic tissues
(adrenal glands, ovaries, and testis) have been shown to highly
express SR-B1 (Acton et al., 1996). Malerod et al. (2002) were
the first group to demonstrate the expression of SR-B1 in LSECs
from isolated rat liver. Several year later, Ganesan et al. (2016)
showed the abundant expression of SR-B1 in mouse LSECs by
confocal microscopy. Mutational and knock-out studies have
suggested an important role of the SR-B1 receptor in facilitating

high density lipoprotein (HDL) uptake in liver and steroidogenic
tissues, thereby, its role in atherosclerosis regulation (Acton et al.,
1996; Kozarsky et al., 1997; Varban et al., 1998). Other than HDL,
SR-B1 also binds to oxLDL, apoptotic cells, unmodified LDL,
VLDL (Kozarsky et al., 1997) as well as vitamin E (Reboul et al.,
2006), carotenoids (During et al., 2005), and silica (Tsugita et al.,
2017). The liver is the primary organ involved in LPS clearance
and LSECs are a major contributor for this activity. SR-B1 may be
involved with some of the LPS clearance, but as of this date, that
is not very clear. There may be a multitude of receptors or “built￾in redundancy” in this LPS clearance system so that LPS levels
from the gut never get high enough to cause acute inflammation
(Ganesan et al., 2016).
CD36 is another member of the Scavenger Receptor B family,
which is located on chromosome 7 and chromosome 5 in
humans and mice, respectively (Cao et al., 1997). The entire
extracellular domain of CD36 and SR-BI share high sequence
homology, though the difference lies in their transmembrane
and cytoplasmic domain sequences (Acton et al., 1996). It is
expressed on adipocytes, capillary endothelial cells, heart and
skeletal muscles, and platelets (Talle et al., 1983; Tandon et al.,
1989b; Abumrad et al., 1993; Greenwalt et al., 1995; Febbraio
et al., 2001) and abundantly expressed on LSECs in the liver
(Strauss et al., 2017). The role of CD36 in the metabolism
of lipoprotein is well-documented (Febbraio and Silverstein,
2007; Jay and Hamilton, 2018). One study demonstrated the
role of CD36 in the uptake of HDL by hepatic NPCs, and
their CD36 knock-out mouse model resulted in a modest but
significant decrease in the HDL uptake in both hepatocytes
and NPCs (Brundert et al., 2011). Similar to SR-B1, CD36
also binds to LDL, VLDL (Calvo et al., 1998), apoptotic
cells (Savill et al., 1991) as well as anionic phospholipids
(Rigotti et al., 1995), and collagen (Tandon et al., 1989a).
Aldehyde modified proteins are likely taken up by CD36 as
the SR-A KO mice had significant, but decreased uptake of
these proteins (Duryee et al., 2005). An earlier study showed
the involvement of CD36 in the endocytosis and degradation
of AGE products, implicating its role in diabetes (Ohgami
et al., 2001). However, Nakajou et al. (2005) demonstrated that
CD36 is not involved in the endocytosis of AGE proteins in
LSECs, suggesting the involvement of other scavenger receptors.
This is quite plausible since “AGE” is a catch-all for all
glycation modifications that occur involving reducing sugars and
independent laboratories likely make and use their own “AGE
modified protein” preparations.
Upregulation of SR-B1 expression has been documented in
the livers of mice fed with a high-fat diet as compared to
control mice, suggesting crucial involvement of SR-B1 in NAFLD
pathogenesis (Qiu et al., 2013). Translating that to humans,
a similar higher SR-B1 expression was observed in type 2
diabetic patients, but no change in hepatic SR-B1 was observed
in NASH and hypercholesterolemia patients, predicting only a
minimal role of SR-B1 in NAFLD (Rein-Fischboeck et al., 2015).
Patients manifesting severe alcoholic hepatitis, inflammation and
oxidative stress symptoms had a correlation with a decrease of
circulating paroxanase/arylesterase 1 (PON1) in the blood and
stimulated alternatively activated (M2) macrophages through
activation of CD36. The idea here is that activated macrophages
internalize increased amounts of oxLDLs via CD36 and SRA1
and that contributes to the pathophysiology of severe alcoholic
hepatitis (Maras et al., 2019). However, none of the studies have
documented the contribution of SR-B1 or CD36 expressed on
LSECs in maintaining a homeostatic environment in the liver or
a modulation in their expression in various diseases.
Scavenger Receptor E (SR-E)
SR-E1/LOX-1, also known as lectin-type oxidized LDL receptor
or oxidized LDL receptor 1 (OLR1) is a type II transmembrane
protein belonging to scavenger receptor E family. It is located
on chromosome 12 in humans and chromosome 6 in mice.
It consists of a transmembrane domain, a short cytoplasmic
domain at the N-terminus, a connecting neck domain and
a C-type lectin-like extracellular domain at the C-terminus
(Sawamura et al., 1997; Park et al., 2005). Maturation of
Lox-1 requires post-translational N-linked glycosylation of the
extracellular domain at the C-terminus and this modification
was shown to be important for binding of various ligands,
intracellular transport, signaling processes, and several other
biological functions (Kataoka et al., 2000). Mutational studies
have shown the importance of conserved C-terminal residues in
the lectin like domain in LOX-1 for ligand binding (Chen et al.,
2001b). LOX-1 is expressed by endothelial cells, macrophages,
vascular smooth muscle cells, adipocytes and chondrocytes in low
levels (Sawamura et al., 1997; Yoshida et al., 1998; Chui et al.,
2005; Akagi et al., 2006). However, an increase in expression
is seen by various pro-inflammatory markers, shear stress and
mechanical stimuli, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α),
and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in vitro (Kume et al.,
1998; Murase et al., 1998). Despite having no homology with
other oxLDL binding SRs, such as SR-A and B, it is considered as
the major endothelial SR for binding, uptake, and degradation of
oxLDL (Sawamura et al., 1997). Other than oxLDL, LOX-1 is also
involved in the binding with apoptotic and aged cells, C-reactive
protein (CRP), bacteria, platelets and anionic phospholipids, such
as phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol, suggesting their
role in various physiological conditions (Oka et al., 1998; Li and
Mehta, 2000; Chen et al., 2001a; Shih et al., 2009).
Under normal conditions, LOX-1 is expressed in low
amounts, in contrast to its high expression during various
pathophysiological events (Ogura et al., 2009; Balzan and
Lubrano, 2018). A study has documented an increased expression
of LOX-1 in the aorta of hypercholesterolemic, hyperlipidemic
rabbits suggesting that a Western diet may induce this receptor
for the overall metabolism of lipids (Chen H. et al., 2000;
Chen M. et al., 2000). Another study was conducted on a
hypertensive rat model using Dahl salt-sensitive and Dahl salt￾resistant rats. Dahl salt sensitive rats develop hypertension when
fed with a high salt diet and Dahl salt resistant rats show minor
blood pressure changes on the same diet. They reported up￾regulation of LOX-1 expression in hypertensive rats, thereby,
suggesting its role in hypertension and a putative target for
treating atherosclerosis (Nagase et al., 1997, 1998). The role of
LOX-1 contributes to the pathology NAFLD resulting, in part,
from LSEC dysfunction. Zhang et al. (2014) studied the effect

Pandey et al. LSEC Receptors
of human LSEC LOX-1 gene knockdown in oxLDL-induced
hepatic injury. They found an increase in ROS production and
enhanced p65 expression in oxLDL treated human LSECs. This
effect was significantly reduced after LOX-1 siRNA treatment,
suggesting the role of LOX-1 in activation of NF-kB and the ROS
pathway. A reduction in the expression of eNOS was found in
human LSEC culture treated with oxLDL, whereas, LOX-1 siRNA
treatment resulted in an enhanced expression of eNOS in this
culture system. They also reported a reduction in the number of
fenestrae, diameter and porosity in ox-LDL-treated human LSEC
culture and LOX-1 siRNA resulted in reversal of these effects,
suggesting its role in stress related atherogenesis (Fraser et al.,
1995). LSEC defenestration was found to be mediated by LOX-1
by upregulating ET-1 and caveolin-1. Although, the association
between LOX-1, ET-1, and caveolin-1 remains unclear, oxidative
stress generated due to ROS production suggests the role
of LOX-1 in NASH and NAFLD pathological manifestations
(Pasarin et al., 2012). Along with SR-A, LOX-1 was also shown
to be responsible for degradation of MAA-Alb (Duryee et al.,
2005). Furthermore, a study conducted on aortic endothelial
cells reported a reduction in LOX-1 expression with aging
and associated it with the progression of aging related diseases
(Khaidakov et al., 2011).
Mannose receptor (MR)/CD206/SR-E3 is another member of
the scavenger receptor E belonging to the C-type lectin family.
It is a type I integral membrane protein which is present on
chromosome 10 in humans and chromosome 2 in mice. The
mannose receptor is composed of an N-terminal extracellular
region and a C-terminal intracellular region. The N-terminus is
composed of three distinct domains and each domain binds to
its specific ligands. First, eight consecutive C-type carbohydrate
recognition domains (CRDs) that bind to terminal mannose
residues, N-acetylglucosamine and L-fucose (Ezekowitz et al.,
1990; Taylor et al., 1992). Second, a fibronectin type-II repeat
domain that binds to collagen I-IV (Martinez-Pomares et al.,
2006; Napper et al., 2006). Third, a cysteine-rich domain at the
N-terminus binds to sulfated sugars, such as GalNAc-4-sulfate
and chondroitin sulfates A and B (Fiete et al., 1998). Besides
binding of specific ligands by their respective domains, MR
is involved in the binding of numerous endogenous ligands,
such as lysosomal hydrolases (Stahl et al., 1976; Elvevold et al.,
2008a), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) (Smedsrod et al.,
1988a), and Procollagen type I carboxy-terminal propeptide
(PICP) (Smedsrod et al., 1990). MR has been implicated in
the binding of several pathogens including Candida albicans,
Pneumocystis carinii, and Leishmania donovani by its cysteine￾rich domain (Stahl and Ezekowitz, 1998; Gordon, 2002; Allavena
et al., 2004). More recent studies have reported MRs binding
with influenza, herpes simplex virus as well as HIV (Milone and
Fitzgerald-Bocarsly, 1998; Reading et al., 2000; Turville et al.,
2002) with varying affinities. The MR is expressed in most tissue
macrophages, LSECs, lymph node and spleen; kidney mesangial
cells, and dendritic cells subsets (Linehan et al., 1999; McGreal
et al., 2004; Linehan et al., 2005).
Due to their ability to recognize and bind with carbohydrate
moieties present on the surface of pathogens, MR expressed
on LSECs is involved in the clearance of denatured collagen
(Malovic et al., 2007). This study showed a reduction in plasma
clearance of radiolabeled DebColl, a heat-denatured type-1
collagen, in a MR KO mouse model in vivo. LSECs isolated
from MR KO mice were not able to internalize radiolabeled
DebColl as efficiently as WT LSECs in vitro. Reduction in the
endocytic capacity of LSECs for removing denatured collagen
might contribute to the onset of pseudo-capillarization or
fibrosis (Ala-Kokko et al., 1987). Subsequently, Elvevold et al.
(2008a) reported the importance of MR in maintaining the
high lysosomal degradation capacity using the MR knock-out
model. They found a reduction in lysosomal enzymes in freshly
isolated LSECs from MR KO mice as compared to WT. They
further examined the endocytic and intracellular degradative
capacity of LSECs and reported that MR KO mice took twice
as long to degrade injected radiolabeled formaldehyde-treated
serum albumin (FSA) as compared to WT, though endocytic
capacity remained the same for both cell types. In accordance
with the former, the MR KO mice contained nearly twice as
much radioactivity than the WT mice 2 h-post-injection. It was
concluded that the cellular uptake of SR ligand is not hampered
in MR KO mice and there is only a deficiency in the amount of
lysosomal enzyme content, hence, reduced degradative capacity
in MR KO mice. This demonstrates that the MR is involved with
the turnover and homeostasis of many intrinsic molecules within
the mammalian organism.
Several studies have shown the expression of MR on LSEC
is impacted by cytokines and inflammatory stimuli. Asumendi
et al. (1996) demonstrated the upregulation of the LSEC MR
after exogenous administration of human recombinant IL-1b in
the rat in vivo. IL-1b is a pro-inflammatory cytokine present in
acute infections. A similar upregulation was observed in the LSEC
MR when IL-1b was induced with LPS in the rat endogenously
(Asumendi et al., 1996). Similarly, enhanced MR expression by
LSECs in culture when incubated with IL-10 or IL-4 with IL￾13 (Liu Y. et al., 2013) acts contrary to IL-1b and is involved
with the “type-II” activation of the immune system. Similarly, a
study on mouse model of C26 colon carcinoma hepatic metastasis
has shown that MR expression level and endocytic capacity
increases with an increase in the production of IL-1b from LSECs.
The increased production of IL-1b resulted from the binding of
ICAM-1 expressed on LSECs with LFA-1 on C26 colon carcinoma
cells (Arteta et al., 2010). This activity decreased secretion of
IFN-γ as well as anti-tumor cytotoxicity. This study discovered
the role of MR in promoting IL-1b and ICAM-1 mediated pro￾metastatic effects in the liver.
Scavenger Receptor H (SR-H)
Stabilin (or FEEL/CLEVER/HARE) receptors are class H
scavenger receptors. They are type I transmembrane proteins
consisting of 20–21 EGF/EGF-like domains, seven fasciclin-1
domains, an X-linked domain, a transmembrane region, and
a short cytoplasmic domain (Politz et al., 2002). This family
consists of two members; Stabilin-1 and Stabilin-2. Stabilin-1
is also known as SR-H1/MS-1/FEEL-1/CLEVER-1. Stabilin-2 is
also known as SR-H2/FEEL-2 and HARE, which is a shorter
isoform of Stabilin-2 generated by proteolytic cleavage (Goerdt
et al., 1991; Weigel, 2019). The main structural difference between

Pandey et al. LSEC Receptors
Stabilin-1 and Stabilin-2 is the presence of 20 EGF-like domains
in stabilin-2 as compared to 21 domains in stabilin-1. Stabilin-1
is located on chromosome 3 and chromosome 14 in humans
and mice, respectively. Stabilin-2 is located on chromosome 12
in humans and chromosome 10 in mice, respectively. Their
extracellular domains share 55% similar homology, but their
short intracellular domains are highly diverse, which results in
differential abundance in different tissues and cells (Harris and
Cabral, 2019). Sinusoidal endothelial cells in the liver, spleen,
adrenal cortex and tissue macrophages express Stabilin-1 (Goerdt
et al., 1991; Kzhyshkowska et al., 2006a), whereas, the expression
of stabilin-2 is abundant in the sinusoids of liver, spleen, lymph
node and bone marrow (Yannariello-Brown et al., 1997; Weigel
and Weigel, 2003; Qian et al., 2009). Both receptors are also
expressed in several other tissues throughout the body at lower
levels (Falkowski et al., 2003). Stabilin-1/2 are considered the
primary scavenger receptors of LSECs and are responsible for
the binding, uptake, and degradation of multifarious ligands,
such as hyaluronan, N-terminal pro-peptide of type I procollagen
(PINP) (Yannariello-Brown et al., 1997; McCourt et al., 1999),
chondroitin sulfates (Harris et al., 2004), AGE (Li R. et al., 2009),
oxLDLs (Li et al., 2011), SPARC (Kzhyshkowska et al., 2006b),
heparin (Harris et al., 2008), von Willebrand factor-factor VIII
(Swystun et al., 2018) and synthetic phosphorothioate antisense
oligonucleotides (Miller et al., 2016).
Stabilin-1, and to some extent, Stabilin-2, in LSECs, are
specifically involved in the uptake of oxLDL, thus playing a role
in the prevention of atherogenesis (Li et al., 2011). The Stabilin
receptors are also involved in the internalization and clearance
of various macromolecules that cannot be cleared by the kidney
due to size limitation for some of these macromolecules. In
2011, it was reported that mice lacking both Stabilin-1 and
Stabilin-2 did not live as long as their WT littermates due to
mild perisinusoidal liver fibrosis and severe glomerular fibrosis.
This study showed that both Stabilin-1 and -2 are essential
for the normal clearance of extracellular matrix material, thus
preserving the homeostasis of the liver as well as other distantly
located organs (Schledzewski et al., 2011). In humans, it is not
known what occurs in Stabilin allelic insufficiency or loss of
function. However, in de-differentiated tissues in cases of liver
cancer, loss in the expression of Stabilin-1 and -2 was seen
in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, and this loss was
inversely related to patient survival. Additionally, loss of Stabilin￾1 and -2 as well as CD32b was also observed around the tissues
surrounding the tumor in HCC patients (Geraud et al., 2013).
Conversely, another study has shown that Stabilin-1 retains its
expression in the LSECs of the diseased liver and mediates
transmigration of T cells, especially T regulatory cells across the
endothelium in the inflamed liver. They also found increased
expression of Stabilin-1 in the vessels and sinusoids lining the
tumor in HCC (Shetty et al., 2011). A survey was conducted on
young and old rats to delineate Stabilin expression and endocytic
capacity in LSECs in response to aging. Their results found that
there was an attenuation in the endocytic capacity of old rats,
although the degradation capacity for both ages were similar.
An increase in LSEC thickness was also observed in old age
rats, which might be responsible for lower endocytic capacity
(Simon-Santamaria et al., 2010). Similarly, another study had
documented a decrease in Stabilin-2 receptors expression on
primary LSECs in an aged rat model (Maeso-Diaz et al., 2018).
From these studies, we may generally conclude that aging results
in reduced expression of the Stabilin receptors and disease may
alter expression and function of these receptors.
LSECs are involved in the synthesis of Factor VIII, a blood
coagulation factor. This pro-coagulant is either defective or
missing in Hemophilia A patients (Powell, 2009). Do et al. (1999)
first identified FVIII mRNA in purified LSECs and hepatocytes
from mice and in cultured LSECs by RT-PCR. They also
found higher FVIII mRNA expression in LSECs quantitatively.
In agreement with this finding, the transplantation of LSECs
isolated from FVB/N-Tie2–GFP mice in a hemophilia A mouse
model restored plasma level of FVIII (Follenzi et al., 2008).
An increase in plasma FVIII correlated with the proliferation
of transplanted LSEC in a Hemophilia A mice model. Two
months after the LSEC transplantation, a bleeding experiment
was performed to evaluate coagulation. The results showed
that bleeding stopped in 15–20 min after a tail-cut which
corrected this disorder. To take this one step further, an
interesting attempt was made to transplant human fetal LSECs
in uPA-NOG (or immunodeficient) mice and evaluate human
FVIII plasma levels in mice (Fomin et al., 2013). Factor VIII
levels were about half as high as a normal human plasma
sample, but the amount far surpassed the non-transplanted
controls indicating that LSECs produce FVIII in appreciable
quantities. These findings suggest a novel role of LSECs in
the treatment of hemophilia A patients suffering from FVIII
deficiency. Interestingly, Stabilin-2 which is highly expressed
in LSECs and in the sinusoids of spleen, also regulates the
clearance rates of FVIII. Based on the data derived from genome
wide association studies (GWAS), both Stabilin-2 and CLEC4M
(see below) have been identified to affect vWF-FVIII levels in
plasma. vWF or von Willebrand factor is normally found in tight
physical association with FVIII in plasma (Lollar, 1991). Using a
combination of KO mice and immunofluorescence techniques,
Swystun and co-workers firmly established that Stabilin-2 and
CLEC4M expressed in LSECs of mice, regulates turnover of FVIII
(Swystun et al., 2018, 2019).
Scavenger Receptor L (SR-L)
LRP-1 (Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein or
CD91 or α2macroglobulin receptor) is a scavenger and endocytic
receptor present on the cell surface belonging to the family
of low-density lipoprotein receptor (Herz et al., 1988). The
structure of LRP-1 is composed of five domains (i) the ligand￾binding domain (ii) the O-linked sugar domain (iii) the EGF￾precursor homology domain (iv) the transmembrane domain
and the intracellular domain. Proteolytic cleavage of LRP￾1 results in alpha subunit ligand-binding domain at the
N-terminus and ß subunit consisting of other remaining
domain at the C-terminus (Lillis et al., 2008). LRP-1 binds
to more than 30 ligands, such as ApoE (Hussain et al.,
1999), tPA (Salama et al., 2019), a receptor-associated protein
(RAP) (Prasad et al., 2016), in addition to trypsin-activated
α2-macroglobulin (α2M∗
), lactoferrin, Factor VIII and others

Pandey et al. LSEC Receptors
(for a complete list of ligands, see Herz and Strickland,
2001). The presence of different motifs at the cytoplasmic tail
of LRP-1, such as two dileucine motifs, NPXY motifs, one
YXXL motif has been suggested to be responsible for its high
endocytic uptake (Li et al., 2000; Deane et al., 2008). LRP-1
is expressed in the liver, lung, brain, intestine, and muscles
(Herz et al., 1988).
Oie et al. (2011) reported the expression of LRP-1 on LSECs
with immunofluorescence. They showed that LRP-1 expressed
in LSECs is responsible for partial hepatic clearance of RAP, an
inhibitor of all known ligand interactions with LRP-1 and α2M∗
,
along with other hepatic cells, suggesting the role of LSECs in
lipid homeostasis. A hepatocyte-specific LRP-1 KO study showed
that NAFLD disease progression is accelerated by the deficiency
of LRP-1 in mice fed with a high-fat high cholesterol diet and
that LSEC and KC LRP-1 were not sufficient to rescue the
phenotype (Hamlin et al., 2018). Similarly, another hepatocyte￾specific LRP-1 KO study has demonstrated an increase in
the accumulation of lipid in primary culture of LRP-1 KO
hepatocytes due to an impairment in the lysosomal degradation
capacity of auto-phagolysosomes leading to cell death (Hamlin
et al., 2016). These studies suggests severe impact of LRP-1
dysregulation on NAFLD progression. However, not much is
known about the LSEC specific function of LRP-1 in various
diseases and this needs to be elucidated.
OTHER CELL SURFACE RECEPTORS
FcγRIIb/CD32b
Fc gamma receptors have four major classes in mice (FcγRI￾IV) and six in humans (Daeron, 1997). Fc gamma receptors IIb
(FcγRIIb) binds to the monomeric immunoglobulin G (IgG)
Fc domain with low affinity and inhibit the response produced
by activating FcγRs. It is located on chromosome 1 in both
humans and mice (Fagerberg et al., 2014; Yue et al., 2014).
FcγRIIb consists of a cytoplasmic region characterized by a 13
amino acid long YSLL sequence, also known as Immunoreceptor
Tyrosine based Inhibitory motif (ITIM) and an extracellular
domain (Van den Herik-Oudijk et al., 1995). Alternative splicing
of mRNA sequence results in two isoform namely FcγRIIb1
and FcγRIIb2. ITIM is essential for its inhibitory function (Van
den Herik-Oudijk et al., 1995). When immunoglobulins on the
cell surface bind and crosslink these receptors, tyrosine 309
is phosphorylated. Tatsushi et al. demonstrated that mutation
of Tyr 309 to phenylalanine in the ITIM motif abolished its
inhibitory effect of B cell activation (Amigorena et al., 1992;
Muta et al., 1994). Daeron et al. (1993) demonstrated that a
single mutation of Tyr26 to glycine at the intra-cytoplasmic
domain and YSLL motif resulted in impairment of endocytosis
and phagocytosis processes, suggesting that phosphorylation or
dephosphorylation of tyrosine residues is important for normal
function of the receptor. Similarly, another study reported that
single amino acid substitution of tyrosine to alanine using
alanine scanning mutagenesis methods resulted in the abolition
of endocytosis (Hunziker and Fumey, 1994). This investigation
discovered that the endocytosis signaling and di-leucine-based
signaling overlap so that you could not have one without
the other in terms of function. The expression of FcγRIIb
is found on the sinusoids of spleen and liver as well as in
immune cells, such as B cells, dendritic cells, myeloid cells
as well as leukemia and lymphoma cells (Lim et al., 2011;
Tutt et al., 2015).
FcγRIIb has been implicated in the regulation of
immunoreactivity. One study has reported a decrease in
expression of FcγRIIb on B cells in active systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE) patients as compared to healthy control,
suggesting its protective role in SLE (Ochi and Kawabi,
1992). Similarly, an increase in FcγRIIb expression on B
cells upon delivery of retroviral transduced FcγRIIb bone in
spontaneous lupus-prone mice compared to the mice that
received parent retrovirus transduced bone marrow (McGaha
et al., 2005). They also found a decrease in the immune complex
accumulation in the kidney as compared to control. Besides
its expression on hematopoietic cells, FcγRIIb expression is
also found exclusively on LSECs, and it is used as a marker
to distinguish LSECs from other liver cell types (Mousavi
et al., 2007). In hepatic sinusoids, FcγRIIb is responsible for
removing small immune complexes (SIC). Ganesan et al.
(2012) studied the blood clearance rate of SIC using radio
iodinated SIC in WT and FcγRIIb KO mice model. They
found an inhibition in the clearance rate of SIC in FcγRIIb
KO mice as compared to control, suggesting the involvement
of LSECs FcγRIIb in immune complex mediated diseases
(Ganesan et al., 2012).
A study conducted on NAFL and NASH biopsy specimens
to assess the expression of FcγRIIb on LSECs reported a
medium negative correlation between serum collagen type IV
and hyaluronan with FcγRIIb expression (Ishikawa et al., 2019).
An increase in type IV collagen and hyaluronan contents
have already been shown with NASH progression, suggesting a
reduction in scavenger function of FcγRIIb. They also witnessed
an inversely proportional relation between FcγRIIb expression
and fibrosis stages, reporting the highest expression at the initial
stage of fibrosis and lowest at fibrosis stage 3. However, taking
all of the data together across the various grades of fibrosis and
NAFLD activity scores, Ishikawa and coworkers did not find
a significant difference in expression level of FcγRIIb. A new
insight in the hepatic fibrosis study was provided by Vilar￾Gomez et al. (2017) who reported platelet counts as a novel
indirect biomarker for portal hypertension and advanced hepatic
liver disease assessment. They reported the inhibitory role of
platelets in fibrosis. In agreement with this study, Ishikawa et al.
(2019) have shown a positive relationship between platelet count
and FcγRIIb expression on LSECs through regression analysis,
suggesting a low platelet count in high fibrosis stage, thereby,
decreased FcγRIIb expression. For HCC, a decrease in FcγRIIb
expression is co-commitment with an increase in cancer grade
similar to Stabilin-2 (Geraud et al., 2013). A study conducted
on peritumoral tissue samples of HCC patients showed that the
expression of FcγRIIb was decreased in 63% of samples taken into
consideration for the study. A microarray analysis of these tissues
found that loss of FcγRIIb is related to significantly longer tumor￾specific survival. However, in terms of the 5-yr survival rate, there

Pandey et al. LSEC Receptors
was more of an impact or survival rate for Stabilin-2 (42%) than
FcγRIIb (16%).
Another ligand of FcγRIIb, fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2),
was found to be increased in NAFLD patients demonstrating
severe forms of NAFLD, suggesting a decrease in FcγRIIb
expression (Colak et al., 2011). This correlation did not hold
across the fibrosis stages or grades of steatosis. Furthermore,
Maeso-Diaz et al. (2018) have shown an even or slight increase in
FcγRIIb expression in the comparison of young and old LSECs,
however, there is a very stark reduction in Stabilin-2, eNOS,
BMP-2, Lamb1, and HGF in aged LSECs suggesting that the
LSECs become vulnerable to acute or chronic injury in old age.
Toll-Like Receptors
Besides scavenger receptors, LSECs express multifarious pattern
recognition receptors mostly consisting of toll-like receptors
(TLRs). TLRs are capable of recognizing pathogen-associated
molecular patterns (PAMP) present on invading microbes or
damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) originating from
endogenous damaged or apoptotic cells (Kawasaki and Kawai,
2014). They are type I transmembrane glycoprotein consisting
of an extracellular N-terminal ligand-binding domain, single
transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain.
Ligand binding is mediated through an ectodomain characterized
by leucine-rich repeats (Bell et al., 2003). Downstream signaling
is mediated by adaptor proteins associated with the Toll/IL-1
receptor (TIR) present at the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain
(O’Neill and Bowie, 2007). TLRs form an important bridge
between innate and adaptive immune response system (Werling
and Jungi, 2003; Pasare and Medzhitov, 2004). TLRs also induce
the production of pro-inflammatory and effector cytokines and
aid in the activation of T-cells by upregulating co-stimulatory
molecules present on antigen-presenting cells (Vasselon and
Detmers, 2002). Humans express 10 TLRs (TLR 1–10), whereas,
mice express 12 TLRs (Hopkins and Sriskandan, 2005). Of these,
LSECs express seven Toll-like receptors; TLR1–4, 6, 8, 9.
Uhrig et al. (2005) demonstrated a constitutive expression
of TLR4 on cultured LSECs isolated from mice. TLR4 binds to
LPS present on gram-negative bacteria and initiates an immune
response for its clearance (Poltorak et al., 1998). In this study,
cultured LSECs developed tolerance upon repetitive exposure
with LPS, though this effect was not mediated by downregulation
in the expression of TLR4. Reduction in the activation of NF-kB
was responsible for developing tolerance against LPS stimulation
in LSECs. Not too long thereafter, Martin-Armas et al. (2006)
showed that CpGs are taken up by TLR9 present in murine
LSECs. The bacterial DNA is characterized by unmethylated
CpG motifs that act as a potent immune stimulator by inducing
the production of cytokines from various immune cells, such
as dendritic cells, macrophages, B cells and NK cells (Ashkar
and Rosenthal, 2002; Dalpke et al., 2006). These studies reported
the presence of TLR9 in murine LSECs for the first-time using
RT-PCR and immunolabeling. LSECs accumulate the most FITC￾labeled CpG than other liver cell types shown by both in vitro
and in vivo experiments. They also reported the binding of CpG
to TLR9 in the endo-lysosomal compartment which activated
NF-κB signaling for the IL-1β and IL-6 production. This study
suggests the role of LSECs in mediating innate immune response
in the liver. A TLR4 KO mouse study demonstrated the role of
TLR4 in NAFLD by enhancing the secretion of hepatic TGF-ß
and collagen associated with fibrosis (Sutter et al., 2016). These
results strongly suggest that the chronic inflammation associated
with fatty liver disease is regulated, in part, by TLR4.
What is the functional role of TLRs in response to ligands in
LSECs? To answer this question, responses to many TLR specific
agonists were evaluated in murine LSECs (Wu et al., 2010).
Upon treatment with TLR specific agonists, the high mRNA
expression level of TLR1,4,6,8 and moderate mRNA expression
level of TLR9 were observed in murine LSEC, however, TLR5,
6, and TLR9 showed very low mRNA expression. Contrary to
mRNA expression, TLR5 and TLR6 did not show any expression
at the protein level in flow cytometry. They also showed that the
antiviral response is produced by TLR3 in LSECs by the secretion
of IFN-β. Furthermore, TNF-α production was reported in
LSECs treated with TLR4 agonists in high amounts and by
TLR2,3 and TLR8 in a moderate amount. Similarly, a 4-fold
and 16-fold upregulation was observed in LSECs treated with
TLR4 and TLR3 agonists, respectively. LSECs were also able
to upregulate MHC class II expression with TLR8 agonists
as well as the proliferation of T-cells with TLR1,2 and TLR6
agonists. Additionally, LSECs were involved with the activation
of CD4 and CD8 T-cells when treated with TLR1,2 and TLR6
agonists. These results suggest that LSECs are capable of initiating
antiviral and pro-inflammatory responses by TLR3 as well
as adaptive responses through TLR1,2,6 and TLR8, thereby
maintaining hepatic immune response. Similarly, the role of
TLR3 stimulated the murine LSECs is reported in suppressing
Hepatitis B viral replication mediated by IFN-ß production
in vitro (Wu et al., 2007).
The portal circulation continuously exposes the liver to
microbial antigens and food from the gut; therefore, it possesses a
piece of special machinery to maintain immune tolerance. Liu J.
et al. (2013) reported that incubation of LSECs with palmitoyl￾3-cysteine-serine-lysine-4 (P3C), a TLR2 ligand, resulted in the
reversal of immune tolerance. LSECs were co-cultured with
stimulated T cells isolated from mice and treated with P3C.
This resulted in an increase in proliferation of T cells as well
as cytokine production in co-culture as compared to T cells
cultured alone. An increase in CD8+ effector T cell population,
IL-12 production, and decrease in PD-L1 expression on LSECs
was also observed in these co-culture systems. This study
outlined the role of TLRs in regulating the immunosuppressive
property in LSECs. Similarly, one study has demonstrated
the role of TLR2 expressed on LSECs in initiating an innate
immune response toward adeno-associated viral vectors (rAAV)
and efficiency of gene therapy mediated by rAAV which may
be enhanced by understanding this mechanism (Hosel et al.,
2012). As the anatomical sieve of the liver, the LSECs are
continually monitoring antigens and confer tolerance to maintain
proper homeostasis.

Pandey et al. LSEC Receptors
sinusoidal endothelial cell C-type lectin (LSECtin)/CLEC4G
are type II transmembrane proteins belonging to the C-type
lectin family (Bashirova et al., 2001; Pohlmann et al., 2001;
Gardner et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2004). These two receptors are
encoded on chromosome 19 in humans (Grimwood et al.,
2004). They are characterized by an intracellular domain,
a transmembrane domain, and an extracellular domain
composed of a neck domain and a C-type carbohydrate
recognition domain (CRD). Ligand binding is mediated through
C-type CRD. L-SIGN is expressed by liver and lymph node
sinusoidal endothelial and placental capillary endothelial
cells (Pohlmann et al., 2001). Likewise, liver and lymph node
sinusoidal endothelial cells specifically co-express LSECtin
(Liu et al., 2004). LSECtin expression is also seen on bone
marrow sinusoidal endothelial cells as well as on KCs in the
liver (Dominguez-Soto et al., 2009). L-SIGN binds to high
mannose oligosaccharide (Feinberg et al., 2001), whereas,
LSECtin can bind with N-acetylglucosamine, mannose, and
fucose (Liu et al., 2004). Since L-SIGN is expressed on placental
capillary endothelium, one study has shown their possible
involvement in mother to child transmission of HIV-1 virus
(Boily-Larouche et al., 2012), while several other studies
relating L-SIGN with HIV-1 entry remain contradictory.
L-SIGN expressed on pulmonary endothelial cells serve as
the gateway for the entrance of SARS-CoV as it was able to
bind HEK293T cells expressing purified soluble SARS-CoV
glycoproteins (Jeffers et al., 2004). Similarly, LSECtin might also
play a role in mediating SARS-CoV infection in hepatocytes
(Gramberg et al., 2005).
L-SIGN has been reported to interact with glycoprotein
E2 of the Hepatitis C viron (HCV) (Gardner et al., 2003).
This study has shown that L-SIGN transfected Hela cells
were able to bind purified HCV-E2 protein as compared to
parental HeLa cells using FACS analysis. Since, mannan is
a ligand for L-SIGN, incubating the recombinant L-SIGN
expressing HeLa cells (HeLa-L-SIGN) with mannan inhibited
binding between L-SIGN and purified HCV-E2 protein. They
confirmed the finding by exposing the HeLa-L-SIGN cells
to HCV-virion and detected the HCV genome in L-SIGN
transfected Hela cells by RT-PCR and Southern blotting.
Similarly, another group has shown the involvement of L-SIGN
in facilitating the entry of HCV and passing it to nearby
hepatocytes present in the liver using HCV pseudotype particles
(Lozach et al., 2004). Since LSECtin and L-SIGN belongs to
the same C-type lectin family and share a 32% sequence
identity, Li Y. et al. (2009) demonstrated that the central
domain of LSECtin binds with L-SIGN and along with the
C terminal CRD domain bind with E2 glycoprotein present
on HCV suggesting that LSECtin binding with L-SIGN might
play a role in the HCV binding to LSECs. LSECtin is also
involved in mediating T-cell immune response in the hepatic
system (Tang et al., 2009). This study showed that LSECtin
binds to CD44, a hyaluronan binding receptor, present on
activated T cells, halting T-cell activation and proliferation,
thereby preventing liver injury. Both of these receptors bind to
mannose residues, which help them in clearing pathogens from
circulation (Liu et al., 2004). These studies suggest that L-SIGN
and LSECtin may be targeted for the treatment of HCV and
inflammatory liver diseases.
LYVE-1
Lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE-1) is a
type I integral membrane glycoprotein which was firstly identified
exclusively on lymph vessels responsible for sequestering
hyaluronic acid in the lymph vessel endothelium (Banerji et al.,
1999). Similar to its homolog CD44, LYVE-1 contains a single
Link module in the extracellular domain that is responsible for
Hyaluronic acid (HA) binding (Day and Prestwich, 2002). It is
present on chromosome 11 in humans and chromosome 7 in
mice. With the use of better antibodies, LYVE-1 expression was
also detected in the liver, spleen, and lymph node sinusoidal
endothelial cells in humans (Mouta Carreira et al., 2001;
Akishima et al., 2004). However, a recent study conducted in
rodents has revealed their expression in the non-sinusoidal
endothelium of many other organs, such as lungs, heart, and
adrenal gland (Zheng et al., 2016). Once regarded as the main
receptor responsible for the internalization and transport of HA
in the lymph circulation, a study using LYVE-1 KO mice model
revealed that it is not crucial for the metabolism of HA in
the lymphatic endothelium (Gale et al., 2007). Since HA is the
only known ligand for LYVE-1, to date, and LSECs play a very
important role in the degradation of HA, Mouta Carreira et al.
(2001) hypothesized that LYVE-1 expression might be present
on LSECs. They performed immunohistochemistry analysis and
confirmed the expression of LYVE-1 on human and murine
LSECs (Mouta Carreira et al., 2001). Since LSECs are the only
LYVE-1 expressing cells in the liver, it can be used to distinguish
LSEC from other liver cell types. Earlier studies had suggested
a link between increased HA level and cirrhosis (Ichida et al.,
1996). This study showed that LSECs from the cirrhotic and HCC
liver had a lower capacity to degrade HA and serum levels of
HA were increased. We now know that Stabilin-2/SR-H2/HARE
previously described in this article is the determining factor for
HA degradation in liver (Eriksson et al., 1983; Harris et al., 2007).
Similarly, data from murine as well as a human models of
HCC reported a reduction in the LYVE-1 expression in liver
tumors with immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis (Geraud et al.,
2013). Additionally, a tissue microarray analysis of 191 HCC
samples found complete loss of LYVE-1 expression in 83% of
the cases as compared to control. There was also a positive
correlation between LYVE-1 expression and histological grade
of the individual tumor with a 47% loss in grade G1 (least)
and 89% in grade G3 (most). Furthermore, Arimoto et al.
(2010) conducted an IHC experiment on frozen normal and
diseased liver tissue and found decreased expression of LYVE-1
and increased vWF expression in inflamed or fibrotic liver.
A weak negative correlation was also observed between LYVE-1
expression and fibrosis stage. An ultrastructural analysis revealed
loss in LSEC fenestration and appearance of the basement
membrane-like structure in the diseased liver, suggesting the
onset of sinusoidal capillarization. They found a similar reduction
in LYVE-1 expression in chronic viral hepatitis and virus-related
cirrhosis liver tissues. This study suggests the possible role of

Pandey et al. LSEC Receptors
LYVE-1 in the progression of liver fibrosis. An increase in
vWF expression with a similar decrease in LYVE-1 expression
poses disturbances in microcirculation. Sinusoidal capillarization
results in circulatory problems and disturbs the transport of
various macromolecules between blood and hepatocytes in
the diseased liver state. Given their role in hepatic disease
progression, LYVE-1 and vWF may be used as a potential marker
for sinusoidal capillarization.
Adhesion Molecules Expressed
by LSECs
Adhesion molecules play an important role in mobilizing
leukocytes at the site of inflammation. This process involves
several steps and carried out by a different set of adhesion
molecules, such as integrins, the selectins, and Ig superfamily
members (Shetty et al., 2018). Each of the adhesion molecules
are tightly regulated to maintain a homeostatic environment and
their expression is modulated under certain diseased condition.
Unlike capillary and microvascular endothelial cells, LSECs
express few integrins. Integrins are heterodimers consisting
of alpha and beta subunits mediating cell-extracellular matrix
adhesion (Bokel and Brown, 2002). Couvelard et al. (1993)
evaluated the expression of different cell-matrix adhesion
proteins in LSECs and found that LSECs express only α1ß1
and α5ß1 under normal condition whereas, αVß3 and αIIbß3
in low and variable levels. α5ß1 acts as fibronectin receptor
(Schaffner et al., 2013), whereas, α1ß1 binds to collagen (Eble
et al., 1993). αVβ3 binds to vitronectin (Horton, 1997) as well
as fibronectin (Van Agthoven et al., 2014) and αIIbß3 binds
to fibrinogen (Wippler et al., 1994). Furthermore, they found
a strong enhanced expression of α1ß1 and α5ß1 as well as
αVß3 and αIIbß3 in cirrhotic liver that were faintly expressed
in normal liver. In addition, other integrins (α6ß1, α6ß4, α2ß1,
and α3ß1) that did not show any expression in normal liver,
and showed an increased expression in cirrhotic liver, suggesting
their contribution to capillarization. These integrins bind to
laminin, an important component of the basal lamina of the
extracellular matrix (Languino et al., 1989; Felch et al., 1992;
Lee et al., 1992; Chang et al., 1995). Several studies have
documented an increased deposition of collagen IV, fibronectin
and laminin in LSEC basement membranes during liver fibrosis
and inflammation (Walsh et al., 2000; Xu et al., 2003; Mak
and Mei, 2017), suggesting a possible role of these integrins in
inflammation and fibrosis.
Similar to microvascular endothelial cells, the LSEC Ig￾superfamily of adhesion molecules is composed of ICAM-1
(Intercellular adhesion molecule-1), ICAM-2 (Intercellular
adhesion molecule-2), VCAM-1 (Vascular cell-adhesion
molecule) and PECAM-1 (Platelet endothelial cell adhesion
molecule/CD31). VCAM-1 is an adhesion molecule that helps
in mediating leukocyte-trans-endothelial migration. VCAM-1
expression is absent in normal liver, but is strongly enhanced
under inflammatory conditions (Volpes et al., 1992). LSECs
constitutively express ICAM-1 along with hepatocytes, KCs
and HSCs (Gulubova, 2005; Yin et al., 2007). The expression
of ICAM-1 in LSECs is found to be upregulated by several
inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, or IFN-γ
(Gangopadhyay et al., 1998; Oudar et al., 1998). A study was
conducted on various endothelial cells isolated from the liver
after transplantation rejection (Steinhoff et al., 1993). In LSECs,
weak expression of ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 was observed under
normal conditions. However, an elevated expression of ICAM-1
and ICAM-2 in LSECs were observed in chronic rejection
as well as sepsis or viral infection cases. VCAM-1 was also
shown to be partially upregulated in LSECs of irreversible and
chronic rejection conditions. This study reflected the clinical
relevance of sinusoidal endothelial adhesion molecules during
liver transplantation.
LFA-1 (Lymphocyte Function Associated-1) belongs to the
integrin family and is present on lymphocytes and leukocytes.
It is an important component in the extravasation process
mediating leukocyte and lymphocyte entry into the tissues
from the bloodstream (Mitroulis et al., 2015; Walling and
Kim, 2018). Binding of ICAM-1 expressed on LSECs to its
ligand, LFA-1, expressed in pro-inflammatory cells mediates the
migration of cells across the sinusoidal lining (Wong et al., 1997).
This was one of the first studies to determine that Selectins,
expressed on continuous vascular endothelium, are not an
essential component for leukocyte transmigration into inflamed
tissue of the liver. Similarly, a co-culture study conducted with
LSECs and C26 tumor cells showed that LSECs expressing
ICAM-1 mediate tumor migration (Benedicto et al., 2019).
They also found an increase in the inflammatory IL-1β, IL￾6, TNF-α, and PGE2 in the co-culture as compare to LSECs
cultured alone. Interrupting the interaction between ICAM-1
and LFA-1 expressed on LSECs and C26, respectively, reduced
the secretion of observed inflammatory molecules. This suggests
the role of ICAM-1 and LFA-1 interaction in providing an
inflammatory microenvironment suitable for colonization of
tumor cells in the liver.
Another Ig superfamily adhesion molecule is PECAM-1
(CD31) (Newman et al., 1990). It is an adhesion molecule
located at the cellular side and is involved in mediating
endothelial cell-cell adhesion. CD31 is also responsible for
carrying out leukocyte and monocyte trans-endothelial migration
(Albelda et al., 1991). Whether LSECs express CD31 or
not has long been debated and remains cryptic (Couvelard
et al., 1993; DeLeve et al., 2004; Elvevold et al., 2008b). An
upregulation in CD31 expression has been shown during the
capillarization of LSECs in cirrhotic human liver (Couvelard
et al., 1993). Also, its enhanced expression is detected in
LSECs during focal nodular hyperplasia (Scoazec et al.,
1995). Likewise, enhanced expression of CD31 has been
related to the non-fenestrated and de-differentiated state of
LSECs (DeLeve et al., 2006). Neubauer et al. (2000b) for
the first time showed the expression of CD31 on LSECs
and found no observable difference in CD31 expression
under normal conditions and carbon tetrachloride-induced
(CCl4) liver fibrosis. However, another study by the same
authors demonstrated a constitutive expression of CD31 on
LSECs, whereas, a decrease of CD31 was observed after CCl4
administration mediated by TNF-α in vitro. They hypothesized
that reduced CD31 expression might aid in more desirable

Pandey et al. LSEC Receptors
mononuclear cell transmigration (Neubauer et al., 2000a).
Clearly, the on-going debate for the expression of CD31 on LSECs
needs to be resolved and it should never be used as a marker for
rodent LSEC purification.
PERSPECTIVES AND CONCLUSION
The past 35 years have proven to be a treasure-trove of discovery
of the unique sinusoidal endothelium in liver. Advancements in
their purification from rats and mice have enabled researchers
to assess their physiological and biological role in normal
and diseased phenotypes. Starting with the efforts of Seglen
(1976) in the early 1970s and culminating to the current
date, the procedure of dissociating the liver with collagenase￾based enzyme mixtures have been very similar. The final
steps in purification have involved differential centrifugation,
fluorescent-activated cell sorting, and magnetic-activated cell
sorting or a combination of these methods. A recent review on
these techniques may be found in Meyer et al. (2016).
The anatomical shape and position of LSECs make them
uniquely optimal for sequestering macromolecular materials
from the blood. In this position, they act as “guardians” of the
liver expressing numerous scavenger receptors and constantly
monitoring the antigenic profile of the blood. As the liver is
bathed in portal vein blood which drains the GI tract, there
are many food and bacterial antigens flowing through in which
LSECs play a major role in cleaning up and tempering other
immune cells within the liver. Table 1 of this manuscript outlined
many of the exogenous and endogenous ligands for all of these
receptors. Redundancy in binding of multiple ligands shared
by several receptors suggest the importance of physiological
homeostasis with regards to external material coming into
contact with blood and internal tissues. What is not known so
much is the biochemistry of how these receptors are taking up
multiple ligands at the same time or which amino acids/domains
are interacting with each ligand. We think that this is an
important step forward with the advancements in crystallography
and cryo-EM methodologies. With an understanding of receptor￾ligand interactions, pharmacological agents may be made to
enhance or block these interactions according to required
circumstances in the patient.
