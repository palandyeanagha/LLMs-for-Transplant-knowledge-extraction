Abstract
Background: The microarray data analysis realm is ever growing through the development of
various tools, open source and commercial. However there is absence of predefined rational
algorithmic analysis workflows or batch standardized processing to incorporate all steps, from raw
data import up to the derivation of significantly differentially expressed gene lists. This absence
obfuscates the analytical procedure and obstructs the massive comparative processing of genomic
microarray datasets. Moreover, the solutions provided, heavily depend on the programming skills
of the user, whereas in the case of GUI embedded solutions, they do not provide direct support
of various raw image analysis formats or a versatile and simultaneously flexible combination of signal
processing methods.
Results: We describe here Gene ARMADA (Automated Robust MicroArray Data Analysis), a
MATLAB implemented platform with a Graphical User Interface. This suite integrates all steps of
microarray data analysis including automated data import, noise correction and filtering,
normalization, statistical selection of differentially expressed genes, clustering, classification and
annotation. In its current version, Gene ARMADA fully supports 2 coloured cDNA and Affymetrix
oligonucleotide arrays, plus custom arrays for which experimental details are given in tabular form
(Excel spreadsheet, comma separated values, tab-delimited text formats). It also supports the
analysis of already processed results through its versatile import editor. Besides being fully
automated, Gene ARMADA incorporates numerous functionalities of the Statistics and
Bioinformatics Toolboxes of MATLAB. In addition, it provides numerous visualization and
exploration tools plus customizable export data formats for seamless integration by other analysis
tools or MATLAB, for further processing. Gene ARMADA requires MATLAB 7.4 (R2007a) or
higher and is also distributed as a stand-alone application with MATLAB Component Runtime.
Conclusion: Gene ARMADA provides a highly adaptable, integrative, yet flexible tool which can
be used for automated quality control, analysis, annotation and visualization of microarray data,
constituting a starting point for further data interpretation and integration with numerous other
tools.

Background
Functional genomics represent a hot topic in biological
research nowadays, embracing the analysis of large data￾sets, through the quantitative measurement of the
genomic expression of the organisms probed, under
numerous conditions. Gene expression microarrays repre￾sent an established, high-throughput measurement tech￾nology. It is an indispensable tool for genome-wide
inspection of changes in the total gene expression of an
organism, which proved to be a major discovery tool in
biological research. Important goals of global gene expres￾sion monitoring experiments are, among others, the iden￾tification of significant alterations in transcript levels
resulting from the exposure of a living system to a given
agent at a specific administration regime [1] or the deriva￾tion of prognostic and diagnostic genetic signatures. Addi￾tionally, high-throughput gene expression profiling is
used in clinical studies in order to: i) identify and catego￾rize diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers ii) classify dis￾eases, e.g. tumours with different prognosis that are
indistinguishable by microscopic examination iii) moni￾tor the response to therapy and iv) understand the mech￾anisms involved in the genesis of disease processes [2].
However, the vast amount of data produced from even a
single microarray slide, requires powerful computational
tools in order to mine valuable information. With statisti￾cal scaling and proper normalization, Differentially
Expressed (DE) genes can be selected on a statistical basis
and provide investigators with a sound basis for meta￾analysis and further research focused on specific biologi￾cal processes or pathways.
In a typical microarray gene profiling experiment, mRNA
is extracted from cells or tissues of interest, reverse-tran￾scribed, labeled and hybridized onto the array surface.
Subsequently, washing under stringent protocols dimin￾ishes through dilution the possibility of non-specific
hybridization. The next step is image acquisition and seg￾mentation. Thus, quantitative estimates of the relative flu￾orescence intensities of each spot/probeset, related to a
gene, are obtained. The signal values thus acquired form a
dataset, which must undergo pre-processing for the miti￾gation of several systematic measurement errors. Typical
pre-processing steps are, image background noise correc￾tion to adjust for non-specific hybridization, presence of
array artifacts, washing issues or quantum fluctuations,
filtering procedures to eliminate non-informative genes
and data normalization [3].
Although a growing number of commercial or open
source microarray data analysis software packages has
already been developed, most of them are either closed
black-box tools (e.g. GeneSpring™, Agilent Technologies)
precluding any further intervention or modification of
their inner logic, or contrary, they are open source rou￾tines, which usually perform very specific and small steps
of the analysis, lacking a standard and consistent frame￾work of parameterization for their coordinated use, given
that they are also addressed to experimental biologists [4].
Although numerous software tools have been developed
[5-10], a major limitation in most of them, is the absence
of predefined analysis protocols or batch processes,
encompassing all analysis stages from raw image analysis
up to the rational derivation of DE gene lists. Exceptions
to this rule exist, such as MIDAS [11], where the definition
of analysis workflows in forms of batch procedures is pos￾sible and FlexArray [12], which does not support 2-colour
microarrays and practically reaches up only to the point of
extraction of DE gene lists. Only in its most recent ver￾sions it has started providing only basic clustering func￾tions.
Specifically, as the field of microarray data analysis field is
continuously expanding also in terms of available soft￾ware, one would expect that tools developed recently,
would tackle and standardize several important issues.
Reduced software complexity for the novice user, multiple
microarray platform support, expansion capabilities cou￾pled with friendly interfaces, customizable ad hoc, to a
wide range of users (non-expert to expert users), and pre￾defined or interactively built analysis workflows are only
few to mention. Nevertheless, recent tools either lack sup￾port for multiple microarray platforms, or they focus only
on parts of the analysis, or ultimately do not properly
apply data filtering steps to each specific dataset [9,12].
For example, in FlexArray, although the user is able to
construct basic analysis workflows, it is not possible to
combine for example the results of the MAS5 algorithm
for detecting absent probesets in Affymetrix arrays, in
order to directly filter the dataset and proceed to statistical
analysis with a less noisy dataset. As a consequence, the
user has to import two different outputs from FlexArray to
spreadsheet or database software (e.g. MS Access, MySQL)
in order to construct filtering queries and then re-import
the data to the main program for further analysis.
Another trend in recent software [8], seems to be the
inclusion of as many statistical methodologies as possi￾ble, under the umbrella of one sophisticated tool, with
enhanced graphical functionalities. Even though many
alternative options are provided in one tool, our experi￾ence indicates that users with limited experience, regard￾ing the correct application of statistical methodologies,
can find themselves befuddled in an endless series of anal￾ysis scenarios. This is further exacerbated by the lack of
pre-defined or interactive analysis workflows. Further￾more, the complexity of this category of tools as well as of
those that focus more on data management and less on
data analysis [10], often necessitates the organization of
special training sessions for the potential users, a rather

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10:354 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/354

(page number not for citation purposes)
undesired side-effect from a user group's perspective that
craves for quick yet cost and time effective solutions.
Moreover, many of the current analysis packages are pro￾vided only as sets of routines, extremely unwieldy to biol￾ogists with limited programming or scripting skills. The
most characteristic example is Bioconductor [4]. Despite
the fact that it represents, undoubtedly, one of the richest
repositories of statistical algorithms and has become, by
all means, a standard for microarray data analysis, its
command line interface limits its usability to many, wet￾lab oriented, biological experts. Several Bioconductor
packages have been assembled through Graphical User
Interfaces, developed with the use of Tcl/Tk modules of R
[13,14]. However, these GUI solutions lack uniformity,
something that often confuses inexperienced users [8]. In
addition, they are often insufficiently documented.
Finally, in the case of GUI embedded solutions, lack of
direct support of various raw image analysis formats is
often observed, thus imposing several rounds of manual
transformation first.
Taking into account the aforementioned limitations,
Gene ARMADA was developed with the scope to provide
both a step by step and a batch mode analysis environ￾ment, beginning from the import of raw image analysis
microarray data. Thus it supports several widely used
microarray image analysis formats as well as more flexible
user-defined formats that ends in annotated DE gene lists,
gene clusters and classifier models. Alternatively, circum￾venting one or more analysis steps, it can further analyze
already processed data, providing the same sets of afore￾mentioned results. Emphasis is placed equally on auto￾mation and flexibility. In this sense, analyses can be fully
automated by using the batch programming module, or
adjusted to ensure specific data manipulations through a
very handy GUI. Depending on the user's programming
skills, the open-source nature of the software allows fur￾ther adjustment of analysis workflows and the addition of
new analysis algorithms. Apart from the batch program￾ming module, experienced users are also able to directly
build their own workflows. This is done by using the com￾mand line version of the algorithms behind Gene
ARMADA, designed to easily operate in command line
mode. In its current version, Gene ARMADA fully sup￾ports the automated processing of 2 coloured cDNA and
Affymetrix oligonoucleotide arrays. Yet through the incor￾poration of a powerful versatile custom import data edi￾tor, its workflows are easily adjusted to support the
analysis of numerous types of already processed results
through its versatile import editor. The program utilizes a
set of gene filtering, normalization, parametric or non￾parametric statistical tests, clustering and classification
algorithms to analyze any number of experimental condi￾tions and replicates. Additionally, it imports novel fea￾tures in microarray signal processing, as the well
established from Systems Theory concept of the signal-to￾noise ratio for background correction in 2-colour microar￾rays, or the condition-based imputation of missing values
(additional file 1)
Implementation
Implementation
Gene ARMADA has been implemented in MATLAB, a very
powerful and globally renowned programming environ￾ment for scientific computing, and can be downloaded
from http://www.grissom.gr/armada/. It has a complete
GUI front-end created using MATLAB's language pro￾grammable user interface objects and GUIDE™. Being
developed on MATLAB, Gene ARMADA is platform inde￾pendent and can be used either as a MATLAB tool, when
MATLAB is installed on the computer, or as a stand-alone
application distributed together with MATLAB Compo￾nent Runtime (MCR). Expert users are given the ability of
further adjusting the analysis workflow to their own spe￾cific needs, by using or editing routines running behind
the GUI, as they are designed to be used also in command
line mode (MATLAB required). Gene ARMADA represents
therefore a stable operating framework for versatile, trans￾parent, seamless algorithmic integration addressing
numerous facets of microarray analysis and meta-analysis.
Gene ARMADA excels among many tools which specialize
either in data visualization, normalization, statistical test￾ing, supervised or unsupervised learning and data annota￾tion by integrating all the above, through a friendly
interface. Data analysis can be performed through a pre￾defined workflow with minimal user interaction through
a batch programming module, or by performing analyses
step by step upon user's requests. The following subsec￾tions summarize those features.
Data import
Currently, the output formats of 4, widely used image
analysis software, are supported (GenePix, ImaGene,
QuantArray, Affymetrix) for automatic data import of
both cDNA and oligonucleotide arrays. The user can also
import a wealth of microarray signal files in tab-delimited
text or Excel form, through a data import wizard where the
user can easily import the minimal necessary parsed raw
data required, for the subsequent analysis. Apart from raw
data, the user can import any kind of already pre-proc￾essed data through a powerful data import wizard in order
to exploit any of the rest of the functionalities of Gene
ARMADA (normalization, statistical selection, clustering,
annotation etc.). Through the data import wizard, the user
can easily associate columns in the file (text tab-delimited
or Excel) with any number of user-defined experimental
conditions.

Background correction
There are 3 options for spot background correction in 2-
colour microarrays supported:
1. Background subtraction: In this case, the net signal
for each channel is calculated, by subtracting the back￾ground signal, from the foreground estimated spot sig￾nal. Then, by taking the log2 ratio between channels, a
measurement of expression for each spot on the array
is obtained. This option represents the widely used
background subtraction method for spot signal correc￾tion.
2. Calculation of the signal-to-noise ratio: In this
case, a different approach is used, where the net signal
for each channel is estimated as the ratio of the fore￾ground estimated spot signal to the background sig￾nal. Therefore, the log2 ratio between channels which
measures the expression levels for each spot is differ￾ently and more robustly scaled than in case (1) above,
across all intensities.
3. No background correction: In this case, only the
foreground estimated spot signal is taken into account
in order to calculate the expression level of each spot
on the array.
For Affymetrix arrays, RMA [15] and GCRMA [16] algo￾rithms are available for background adjustment.
Spot quality filtering
Poor quality spots are identified in 2-colour microarrays
as follows:
Firstly, spots marked as poor either manually, or by the
image analysis software are excluded. Noise sensitive
genes are further isolated for each array based on 3 possi￾ble filters applied to both channels:
1. A signal-to-noise threshold filter below which noisy
spots are filtered out from the slide. The default filter
value is 2.
2. A filter based on the distance between the signal and
background distributions; spots satisfying the inequal￾ity are filtered out, where S and B
denote the signal and background and x and y are user￾defined parameters defining the strictness of the filter:
as x and y increase, more spots are filtered out, as only
those that have clearly separated foreground and back￾ground distributions can pass the filter. The default
parameters for this filter are (x, y) = (1,2).
3. A custom filter based on the signal and background
means, medians and standard deviations. The user can
use the above descriptive statistics parameters to for￾mat a personal filter when imported data are known to
exhibit a special or known behaviour, or simply when
the user wishes to explore multiple data filtering pos￾sibilities. By providing a custom filtering option, Gene
ARMADA also allows the experienced user to define a
more complex filter based on the aforementioned
parameters.
For Affymetrix arrays, the first step of poor quality signal
identification is performed using the MAS5 detection
algorithm to call present/absent probesets.
Secondly, outlier detection is performed for each spot,
among the replicates of each experimental condition. Par￾ametric or non-parametric tests are applied, to check if
values follow the normal (or a continuous symmetrical)
distribution with mean (median) equal to the average for
this spot among all replicates. Error prone spots are
excluded from the estimation of the normalization curve,
to mitigate the impact of systematic measurement errors.
For the case of Affymetrix arrays, this step is performed
posterior to background adjustment/normalization/sum￾marization steps.
Normalization
Currently, 7 within slide normalization methods for 2-
colour microarrays are supported: Global Mean/Median,
Linear Lowess, Robust Linear Lowess, Quadratic Loess,
Robust Quadratic Loess and Rank Invariant [17]. The
robust Lowess/Loess versions [18] execute additional fit￾ting iterations while readjusting each point's weight on
each iteration to alleviate the impact of possible outliers.
If subgrid coordinates exist for the imported array type,
subgrid normalization is also possible and there is also
full support for dye-swap experiments. Between-slides
normalization is part of the statistical analysis workflow
and can be performed using Quantile normalization [19]
or MAD centering [20]. For Affymetrix arrays, either
Quantile or Rank Invariant normalization can be per￾formed.
Statistical selection
Selection of DE genes is implemented by using a graphical
interface where the user can define (or use default values)
several parameters and contrasts for each analysis, per￾formed in a workflow manner. It starts with the calcula￾tion of the Trust Factor (TF) which is defined for each gene
as the ratio of its number of qualified replicates after the
filtering step, to the total number of replicates, for each
condition. The definition of the TF according to user's
requests sets a reliability threshold, excluding genes from
further analysis. The imputation of missing values for a

gene is based on the average expression of the remaining
present values of that gene from the same experimental
condition or the kNN imputation algorithm [21]. It can
be performed before or after between-slides normaliza￾tion (default is after). Differentially expressed genes are
acquired using parametric (ANOVA, t-test) or non-para￾metric (Kruskal-Wallis) statistical tests. Multiple testing
correction is performed by controlling the FWER [22] or
the FDR [23,24]. After the completion of each contrast,
the user is prompted to accept the results or repeat the
analysis using different parameter sets.
Data clustering and classification
Currently, Gene ARMADA supports 3 fully customizable
clustering algorithms: Hierarchical and k-means cluster￾ing based on the Statistics Toolbox of MATLAB and fuzzy
C-means clustering [25]. A novel contribution is the auto￾mated derivation of the optimal number of clusters for the
appropriate classification/partition of the dataset in gene
groups. This is performed through the utilization of the
Gap statistic [26], in a routine implementation which, by
using distance metrics comparison with different refer￾ence gene signal distributions and iteration, selects the
optimal number of clusters. Principal Component Analy￾sis [27] is also provided for the derivation of the critical
features of datasets. Supervised classification can be per￾formed using Discriminant Analysis, k-Nearest Neighbors
or Support Vector Machines [28] using the OSU-SVM
toolbox [29], which supports multiclass classification and
is based on the widely utilized libsvm [30]. Classifier
parameterization can be performed, through an imple￾mented interface for the appropriate tuning of each algo￾rithm. This interface includes flexible dialogs where the
user can define several parameters to be tested (or accept
the defaults), as well as several classifier performance
plots and detailed output depicting statistics concerning
the performance of each classifier.
Visualization tools
Gene ARMADA provides a variety of visualization, explo￾ration and quality assessment graphs, such as array spatial
images for several spot quantitation types, normalized
and un-normalized expression values, individual and
array versus array plots for several quantitation data,
expression distribution histograms, boxplots, MA, vol￾cano and expression profile plots, clustering heatmaps
and classifier evaluation plots. Most graphs are interactive
and users can select and export data directly in various
graphic formats. The variety of provided visualization
tools can be utilized for numerous purposes, encompass￾ing among others, quality control and analysis (e.g. nor￾malization) assessment, in order to aid in threshold and
parameter estimation for several procedures, like statisti￾cal analysis, clustering and supervised classification.
Data export
The results of the analyses can be exported in tab delim￾ited or Excel file formats, or as .mat files so that the expe￾rienced user can further process the data with other
MATLAB built-in algorithms. The output is customizable
through an export wizard, allowing either basic data
export for exploratory purposes, or the export of rich spe￾cific formats for direct use with other tools, such as Gen￾MAPP [31] for mapping gene expression on cellular
pathways, or for Gene Ontology Terms based statistical
analysis, through the utilization of the software package
named RankGO [32] (available for download from http/
www.eie.gr/nhrf/institutes/ibrb/programmes/metaboli
cengineering-softwaretools.html). Outputs can be mas￾sively annotated through an annotation module.
Batch programmer
Gene ARMADA offers a batch analysis programming
module which can be used to schedule several analysis
rounds, encompassing different methods and parameters.
This feature offers the user the ability to simply import the
data and then pre-define multiple analysis workflows
without having to personally monitor the whole proce￾dure. Upon completion of the execution of the batch
processing, the user can collect the multiple outputs, and
directly compare the differences among different method/
parameter sets. Specifically, through the batch scheduling
module, users can set: i) filtering and normalization steps,
ii) define multiple analysis dispatches of multiple statisti￾cal comparisons among different experimental condition
and replicate sets and also iii) define different clustering
procedures. In this way, they are capable of conducting
multiple algorithm exploration tests at once. The batch
analysis options can be saved in a separate file, so that
they can be easily recalled. The batch analysis results can
be saved as a Gene ARMADA project so that they can be
later loaded into the main program for visual data explo￾rations or exporting in other storage formats.
Data analysis structures
The data analysis structures implemented in Gene
ARMADA allow users to define several experimental con￾dition and slide replicate subsets in distinct analysis
objects, each carrying the essential data required to main￾tain and/or easily recall analysis steps performed for each
analysis run. This implementation allows the conduct of
different comparisons without repeating the computa￾tionally intensive normalization task when not necessary.
In addition, it enables the examination and assessment of
the performance of different filtering and normalization
steps, with respect to dataset specific optimized tuning of
the algorithmic processing pipeline.

Results and discussion
Gene ARMADA aims to provide investigators with a com￾plete, open-source, flexible and handy platform for both
cDNA and oligonucleotide (Affymetrix) microarray data
analysis. It encompasses all levels of analysis to easily
interpretable and simply manipulated gene lists. It
addresses a very wide category of users, practically meet￾ing all levels of competences regarding analysis and inter￾pretation of microarray experiments, by providing a
friendly software environment equipped with a graphical
user interface, plus automated workflows for the analysis
of microarray experiments together with absolutely open
source routines, adjustable to meet specific data process￾ing needs. The adoption by Gene ARMADA of a specific
analysis protocol (Figure 1), represents one of the major
strengths of it, as it provides a solid base of standardiza￾tion of the microarray experiments processing, where the
data handling steps among different experiments can be
boiled down to very specific descriptions that unequivo￾cally characterize the type of transformations applied to
various data populations. Additionally, Gene ARMADA
integrates several major steps of microarray data analysis
(2-colour and single dye) under one tool, and represents
a connection point for annotation tasks, as well as cus￾tomizable integration of numerous other, microarray data
analysis tools.
The total computational cost of an experiment depends
heavily on the amount of arrays to be analyzed, as well as
the type of data processing workflow selected for imple￾mentation (e.g. while global median normalization is pre￾formed in less than a second, robust LOESS requires a
much larger amount of time due to local data processing).
Yet the inherently parallel structure of the Gene ARMADA
analysis workflows renders it an amenable environment
for parallel computing. In this sense, Gene ARMADA rep￾resents the prototype, upon which the development of a
web-based microarray analysis application, integrating in
its programming, principles of Grid computing, GRIS￾SOM (http://www.grissom.gr, GRids for In Silico Systems
BiOlogy and Medicine) has been developed. Concerning
the program use, apart from the graphical interface, the
user can program several analysis rounds through the
batch programming module. A snapshot of the program is
illustrated in Figure 2.
It is to be noted that the signal-to-noise ratio imple￾mented background correction method that utilizes the
signal-to-noise content of a signal, is an established
notion in systems theory and image processing [33]. It
represents a pre-processing step, in line with the percep￾tion of the experimentalist about signal quality, empha￾sizing in the signal strength compared to noise. Given the
reported controversy on background subtraction [34], this
approach is critical, especially regarding weak signal data￾sets, whereas a majority of spot signals is close or even
below the background levels. To our knowledge, there is
no other analysis tool using the signal-to-noise ratio for
background correction for 2-colour microarrays.
Finally, it should be also stressed here the novelty regard￾ing the automated derivation of the optimal number of
clusters, for the appropriate classification/partition of the
dataset to gene families through the utilization of the Gap
statistic [26]. This is another crucial feature for automated
clustering procedures. Gene ARMADA has been success￾fully used so far for the analysis of several microarray data￾sets, including datasets concerning interstitial pulmonary
fibrosis [32] and gene expression profiling of progestin￾induced canine mammary hyperplasia and spontaneous
mammary tumors [35]. It has also been used for process￾ing microarray datasets concerning gene expression profil￾ing of mouse liver and lung tissues after treatment with
different dosages of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (S.
Kyrtopoulos, personal communication). Additionally it
has been used for clustering RNA Polymerase II occupancy
in 2 ChIP-Seq datasets [36,37] from Next Generation
Sequencing experiments, thus proving the generic design
of the Gene ARMADA algorithmic modules, which render
it adjustable to versatile processing tasks. Software effi￾ciency and good functionality has also been extensively
tested with several microarray datasets retrieved from
public repositories such as ArrayExpress and GEO.
Conclusion
Gene ARMADA aspires to provide a unified, automated
and flexible platform for both 2-colour and Affymetrix
oligonucleotide microarray data analysis and interpreta￾tion. It is programmed in MATLAB, exploiting elements
from the Statistics and Bioinformatics Toolboxes and
offering friendly integration with numerous other tools.
Gene ARMADA has been successfully used to process sev￾eral microarray datasets and has been tested with multiple
public datasets some of which are available for download
