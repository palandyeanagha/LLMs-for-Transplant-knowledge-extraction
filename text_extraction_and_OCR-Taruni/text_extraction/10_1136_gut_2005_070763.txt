Background: The hepatic outcome of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive patients undergoing
chemotherapy after withdrawal of pre-emptive lamivudine is unknown.
Aims: To examine the occurrence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation after withdrawal of pre-emptive
lamivudine.
Methods: Pre-emptive lamivudine was started one week before initiation of chemotherapy in 46
consecutive HBsAg positive patients and continued for the entire duration of chemotherapy. Pre-emptive
lamivudine was stopped at a median 3.1 (range 3.0–3.4) months after completion of chemotherapy.
Patients were longitudinally followed up after withdrawal of pre-emptive lamivudine.
Results: Median time of follow up after withdrawal of lamivudine was 25.7 (range 5.7–75.7) months.
Eleven of the 46 patients (23.9%) developed HBV reactivation after withdrawal of pre-emptive lamivudine.
Eight of the 16 patients with high pre-chemotherapy HBV DNA (>104 copies/ml) compared with three of
the 30 patients with low pre-chemotherapy HBV DNA (,104 copies/ml) developed HBV reactivation
(50.0% v 10.0%, respectively; p,0.001). Hepatitis B e antigen positive patients were also more likely to
develop HBV reactivation (5/11 (45.5%) v 6/35 (17.1%), respectively; p = 0.041). A high pre￾chemotherapy HBV DNA (>104 copies/ml) was the most important risk factor for HBV reactivation after
withdrawal of pre-emptive lamivudine on Cox proportional hazards analysis (relative risk 16.13, (95%
confidence interval 2.99-87.01; p = 0.001).
Conclusions: HBV reactivation is more likely to occur in patients with high pre-chemotherapy HBV DNA
after withdrawal of pre-emptive lamivudine. A more prolonged course of antiviral therapy may be
necessary in these patients after completion of chemotherapy in order to reduce post-chemotherapy HBV
reactivation.
Hepatitis due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation is a
serious cause of liver related morbidity and mortality in
hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive patients
undergoing cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapy.1 2 Liver
damage due to HBV reactivation is a two stage process.
Initially, during intense cytotoxic or immunosuppressive
therapy, there is an increase in viral replication, as reflected
by an increase in serum levels of HBV DNA, hepatitis B e
antigen (HBeAg), and HBV DNA polymerase, resulting in
widespread infection of hepatocytes. Restoration of immune
function due to withdrawal of cytotoxic or immunosuppres￾sive therapy will then result in a rapid immune mediated
destruction of HBV infected hepatocytes. This destruction of
HBV infected hepatocytes can manifest as hepatitis, hepatic
failure, and even death.2–4
Although initial reports of HBV reactivation involved
mainly patients with haematological malignancies, it has
also been reported in patients with solid tumours.3 5–9
Reactivation of HBV replication with decompensation has
been reported in 20–50% of chronic HBV patients undergoing
cytotoxic chemotherapy.3 8 10 With the increasing incidence of
neoplastic diseases and more widespread use of cytotoxic
chemotherapy, the incidence of HBV reactivation is likely to
rise further in HBV endemic areas and in migrants from HBV
endemic areas.11 This has led to the recent recommendation
that patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy should be
screened for HBsAg before initiation of chemotherapy.12
As HBV reactivation due to cytotoxic or immunosuppres￾sive therapy is related to the host immune response to
enhanced HBV replication, antiviral agents such as lamivu￾dine and famciclovir have been used to decrease the risk of
HBV reactivation in patients receiving immunosuppressive
therapy.13–18 However, despite the use of nucleoside analogues
at the time of clinical hepatitis, hepatic failure and mortality
still occurred. This is likely to be due to the late institution of
nucleoside analogues when the immune mediated damage of
the liver has already been established.19 Hence it is accepted
that nucleoside analogues should be administered pre￾emptively before the onset of clinical hepatitis due to HBV
virological reactivation.19–21
The availability of data on the safety and efficacy of
lamivudine as pre-emptive therapy for patients undergoing
cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapy has led to a
consensus recommendation that all patients with chronic
HBV infection should be given a short course of lamivudine
while receiving cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapy as
prophylaxis against reactivation of HBV.12 22 But, as pro￾longed lamivudine therapy is associated with an increased
likelihood of developing lamivudine resistant mutants, most

cancer centres would aim at discontinuing or withdrawing
pre-emptive lamivudine as soon as possible in order to limit
the duration of antiviral therapy.20–26 However, at the moment
there is no available consensus on the optimal duration of
lamivudine therapy. This is mostly due to lack of data on the
occurrence of hepatic flares after the withdrawal of pre￾emptive antiviral therapy in these patients.
The current recommendation is for prophylactic lamivu￾dine to be started one week before and continued for at least
six weeks after the end of chemotherapy in order to reduce
the frequency and severity of HBV reactivation.12 Based on
reported series, continuation of lamivudine for a variable
period of 1–6 months after completion of chemotherapy has
been shown to be equally effective in reducing HBV
reactivation.13 16 17 27 28 However, the duration of pre-emptive
lamivudine in these studies is arbitrary and a predetermined
set of criteria for the withdrawal of lamivudine after
completion of chemotherapy is not employed.
As HBV reactivation after cytotoxic or immunosuppressive
therapy is usually accompanied by an upsurge of white cell
counts from the nadir, our centre has adopted a protocol of
only withdrawing lamivudine once the total white cell count
has normalised (.4.06109
/l) and at least three months after
completion of chemotherapy.21 The concept of this protocol or
approach is to cover the entire period when the host
interaction with HBV has been disturbed as a result of the
cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapy. This way, we would
only be withdrawing lamivudine after recovery from the
effects of cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapy and at a
time when the host’s immune system has recovered
sufficiently to the pre-chemotherapy state.
In our present study, we examined the occurrence of
hepatic flares after withdrawal of pre-emptive lamivudine,
and determined what factors are associated with hepatic
flares after withdrawal of pre-emptive lamivudine.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients
From 1999 to December 2004, 1093 consecutive patients
were treated with intravenous cytotoxic chemotherapy for
haematological malignancy at the Haematology and
Oncology Unit, University Department of Medicine, Queen
Mary Hospital, Hong Kong SAR, China. All patients were
screened for HBsAg, hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs)
(enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay II; Abbott
Laboratories, Chicago, Illinois, USA), human immunodefi￾ciency virus antibody (Abbott Laboratories), and hepatitis C
virus antibody (Ortho Diagnostics System, Raritan, New
Jersey, USA). Further testing for HBeAg, hepatitis B e
antibody (anti-HBe; Abbott Laboratories), and serum HBV
DNA was performed on all HBsAg positive patients. Serum
HBV DNA was quantified by real time polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) using the DyNAmo HS SYBR Green qPCR kit
(Finnzymes Oy, Finland), as previously described by our
group.29 The linear quantification range of our assay is 102
–
108 copies/ml.
All HBsAg positive patients were assessed by an experi￾enced hepatologist (GKKL) before initiation of chemother￾apy. None of the HBsAg positive patients had clinical
evidence of decompensated cirrhosis (ankle oedema, ascites,
jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy), and their albumin,
bilirubin, and prothrombin time were all within the normal
range.
All HBsAg positive patients were managed by a single
hepatologist (GKKL) according to a standardised protocol.
Pre-emptive lamivudine was started one week before initia￾tion of chemotherapy. Pre-emptive lamivudine was contin￾ued throughout the entire period of chemotherapy and was
discontinued at least three months after completion of
chemotherapy and when the total white cell count had
normalised (normal range 4.0–11.06109
/l).
All patients were prospectively followed up every two
weeks while on lamivudine or chemotherapy. After with￾drawal of lamivudine, patients were prospectively followed
up every two weeks for the first three months and then
monthly until the time of analysis (March 2005) or death. At
each follow up visit, the clinical status of the recipients was
recorded and blood was tested for liver biochemistry (serum
alanine aminotransaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransa￾minase, bilirubin, and albumin). HBsAg, HBeAg, anti-HBs,
and anti-HBe, and serum HBV DNA were also tested on every
visit.
Patients developing hepatic failure were tested for lami￾vudine resistant mutants by determination of HBV polymer￾ase gene by direct sequencing, as previously described.15
Definition of hepatic events
HBV related hepatitis during chemotherapy was diagnosed in
the presence of a more than threefold elevation in serum ALT
levels on two consecutive tests five days apart, accompanied
by an elevation in serum HBV DNA to more than 10 times
that of the pre-exacerbation baseline in a patient who
remained HBV DNA positive or if serum HBV DNA switched
from negative to positive.

HBV reactivation after lamivudine withdrawal was defined
as elevation of serum ALT levels above the upper limit of
normal on two consecutive determinations at least five days
apart accompanied by a serum HBV DNA of >105 copies/ml
in HBeAg positive patients or elevated serum ALT levels on
two consecutive determinations five days apart accompanied
by a serum HBV DNA of >104 copies/ml in HBeAg negative
patients.22 Hepatic failure was defined as the presence of
hepatic encephalopathy and deranged blood coagulation
(prothrombin time exceeding 10 seconds of control).
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board
of the Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong SAR, China.
Informed consent was obtained from all patients for long￾itudinal follow up.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical
Program for Social Sciences (SPSS 12.5 for windows; SPSS
Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). The Mann-Whitney U test was
used for comparing two continuous variables and the x2 test
with Yates’ correction for continuity or Fisher’s exact test for
comparing two categorical variables. The primary outcome
measure was occurrence of HBV reactivation after with￾drawal of lamivudine. The secondary outcome measure was
to determine the occurrence of hepatic failure due to HBV
reactivation after withdrawal of lamivudine and to determine
the variables associated with HBV reactivation and hepatic
failure after lamivudine withdrawal. The Kaplan-Meier
method was employed for calculation of the cumulative
probability of HBV reactivation. A Cox’s proportional hazards
model was used to estimate the relative risk (RR) of HBV
reactivation after withdrawal of lamivudine and hepatic
failure associated with HBV DNA levels of >104 copies/ml,
positive HBeAg, and abnormal serum ALT levels pre￾chemotherapy. The 95% confidence interval (CI) for the RR
was also calculated. Continuous variables were expressed as
median (range). All statistical analyses were performed on an
intention to treat basis. Statistical significance was defined as
p,0.05 (two tailed).

RESULTS
A total of 128 of 1093 patients (11.7%) were HBsAg positive.
Of these 128 HBsAg positive patients, 82 were excluded from
analysis for the following reasons: 41 (32.0%) patients had
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation after clinical remis￾sion was achieved, 30 (23.4%) had already been included into
a previous study,21 nine (7.0%) died of disease progression
and were still on lamivudine at the time of fatality, and two
(1.6%) developed YMDD resistance while on lamivudine and
were commenced on adefovir dipivoxil in addition to
lamivudine. None of these 46 patients had stigmata of
chronic liver disease or evidence of liver cirrhosis before
chemotherapy. The remaining 46 of these 128 patients
(35.9%) were included in the study. Demographic data of
these 46 patients are shown in table 1.
None of these 46 patients developed HBV related hepatitis
during the course of chemotherapy. Median duration of pre￾emptive lamivudine in conjunction with chemotherapy is
shown in table 2.
HBV reactivation after withdrawal of pre-emptive
lamivudine
Median follow up time after withdrawal of lamivudine to the
time of analysis in these 46 patients was 25.7 (range 5.7–
75.7) months. At the time of withdrawal, all patients (100%)
had a serum HBV DNA level of ,104 copies/ml.
Eleven of the 46 patients (23.9%) developed HBV reactiva￾tion after withdrawal of lamivudine (fig 1). The cumulative
probability rates of HBV reactivation after lamivudine with￾drawal at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months were 0%, 2%, 5%,
13%, 16%, and 33%, respectively (fig 1). Lamivudine was
resumed in all 11 patients who developed HBV reactivation.
Baseline characteristics of patients with and without HBV
reactivation after withdrawal of lamivudine are shown in
table 3.
Factors predictive of HBV reactivation after withdrawal of
lamivudine were serum HBV DNA >104 copies/ml before
chemotherapy (8/16 patients (50.0%) v 3/30 (10.0%) patients,
respectively; p,0.001 on log rank) (fig 2A) and a positive
HBeAg before chemotherapy (5/11 patients (45.5%) v 6/35
(17.1%) patients, respectively; p = 0.041 on log rank) (fig 2B).
When multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to
assess HBV reactivation after withdrawal of pre-emptive
lamivudine, a serum HBV DNA of >104 copies/ml before
chemotherapy was the only independent factor in predicting
HBV reactivation after withdrawal of pre-emptive lamivudine
(RR 16.13 (95%CI 2.99–87.01); p = 0.001) (table 4).
Hepatic failure due to HBV reactivation after
withdrawal of lamivudine
Three of 11 patients (27.3%) with HBV reactivation after
withdrawal of lamivudine developed fulminant hepatic
failure (fig 3). None of these three patients with hepatic
failure had lamivudine resistant mutants. The characteristics
of these three patients are shown in table 5.
One of these 11 patients (9.1%) died from bleeding
oesophageal varices and hepatic encephalopathy. Ten of 11
patients (90.9%) with HBV reactivation recovered with
lamivudine therapy. All 10 patients were still alive at the
time of analysis.

Hepatic failure was higher in patients with a serum HBV
DNA of >104 copies/ml before chemotherapy (3/16 (18.8%)
patients v 0/30 (0%) patients, respectively; p = 0.005 on log
rank). Two of 11 HBeAg positive patients compared with one
of 35 HBeAg negative patients developed hepatic failure after
withdrawal of lamivudine (18.2% v 2.9%, respectively;
p = 0.069 on log rank). One of four patients with elevated
serum ALT levels before chemotherapy compared with two of
42 patients without elevated serum ALT levels before
chemotherapy developed hepatic failure after withdrawal of
lamivudine (25.0% v 4.8%, respectively; p = 0.068 on log rank).
The relative risk of developing hepatic failure after with￾drawal of lamivudine was higher in patients with serum HBV
DNA of >104 copies/ml before chemotherapy and in patients
with positive HBeAg before chemotherapy (table 6).
HBV serology
None of the 11 HBeAg positive (0%) patients lost HBeAg
while none of the 35 anti-HBe positive (0%) patients
developed HBeAg reversion after withdrawal of lamivudine.
DISCUSSION
Nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine or adefovir
dipivoxil are now available for the treatment of hepatitis
due to HBV reactivation in HBsAg positive subjects under￾going intense chemotherapy. With the results of recent
studies, it is now generally accepted that early rather than
deferred pre-emptive therapy with these antiviral agents
should be adopted for HBsAg lymphoma patients undergoing
intense chemotherapy to reduce post-chemotherapy HBV
related morbidity and mortality.21 30 However, the optimal
duration of lamivudine administration has not yet been
defined. An additional 1–6 months of administration of
lamivudine after completion of chemotherapy has been
recommended by some studies.13 16 17 27 28 Nevertheless, pro￾longed use of lamivudine cannot guarantee its clinical benefit
due to the emergence of lamivudine resistant strains in
10–30% after one year of therapy.31 On the other hand, if the
duration of lamivudine therapy is too short, there is a risk
that the antiviral prophylaxis may not be adequate.
One of the major concerns with the use of lamivudine has
been the occurrence of withdrawal hepatic flares on stopping
lamivudine.32 A few studies have reported on follow up of
patients, with pre-emptive lamivudine being withdrawn
1–6 months after completion of chemotherapy. One reported
no incidence of post-lamivudine hepatitis flares in its three
cases,27 another had one case of hepatic flare among 20
patients,28 while the third only reported hepatic flares in four
of their 65 patients.20 Hepatic flares in these studies were all
reported to be self limiting. However, the follow up period
after withdrawal of lamivudine was short and limited to
approximately 8–12 weeks after withdrawal of pre-emptive
lamivudine. One recent publication however reported delayed
HBV reactivation in four HBsAg positive lymphoma patients
at 6–8 months after withdrawal of lamivudine.30
Furthermore, there has been report on cases of hepatic
failure resulting in fatality after withdrawal of lamivudine in
immunocompetent patients with chronic HBV.33
In this study, we have longitudinally followed up a cohort
of patients on pre-emptive lamivudine for a median of 25.7
(range 6–75) months. All patients had their pre-emptive
lamivudine withdrawn under the same set of criteria. At the
time of analysis, the cumulative probability of HBV reactiva￾tion 36 months after withdrawal of lamivudine was 33%. The
occurrence of hepatic flares due to HBV reactivation in this
series was not as benign or as self limiting as previously
reported.20 In fact, three patients developed hepatic failure,
with one fatality. The three cases of hepatic failure developed
within 13 months of lamivudine withdrawal. None of these
three patients with hepatic failure had lamivudine resistant
mutants, detected by direct PCR sequencing. Thus patients
should be monitored closely for a more prolonged period of
time as no patient developed HBV reactivation within the
first three months after lamivudine withdrawal (fig 1).
A serum HBV DNA level of >104 copies/ml before
chemotherapy is an independent risk factor for the

development of HBV reactivation after withdrawal of pre￾emptive lamivudine. Withdrawal of lamivudine would result
in a ‘‘rebound’’ and resurgence of viral replication.32 This
‘‘rebound’’ can result in HBV DNA returning to its pre￾chemotherapy level or even higher, as shown in fig 3, and is
in keeping with the observation made in another study.30 This
explains why patients with a higher pre-chemotherapy HBV
DNA have a higher risk of developing HBV reactivation or
even hepatic failure after withdrawal of lamivudine.
In this study, HBeAg positive patients had a higher risk of
developing HBV reactivation after withdrawal of pre-emptive
lamivudine. This is probably because HBeAg positive patients
had a higher HBV DNA level despite a normal serum ALT
level (the immune tolerant phase).4 22 Furthermore, patients
in the immune tolerant phase are also less likely to develop
HBeAg seroconversion despite lamivudine, explaining why
none of the 11 HBeAg positive patients in this study
developed HBeAg seroconversion while on lamivudine.34
Therefore, patients with a high pre-chemotherapy serum
HBV DNA might need a prolonged course of lamivudine in
order to maintain remission of HBV. HBeAg positive patients
may even require HBeAg seroconversion before pre-emptive
lamivudine can be safely withdrawn in order to achieve a more
prolonged clinical benefit.35 HBeAg negative patients with high
serum HBV DNA may also require prolonged therapy with
lamivudine as it has been shown that a sustained response can
be achieved in HBeAg negative immunocompetent patients
after a two year course of lamivudine therapy.36
However, this prolonged course of lamivudine in HBeAg
positive and negative patients will increase the risk of
developing lamivudine resistant mutants. The fact that
lamivudine resistant mutants can be associated with rapid
clinical deterioration after transplantation has raised addi￾tional concerns about prolonged lamivudine therapy in
immunocompromised patients.37 38 One way to overcome this
problem is by using alternative nucleoside analogues that
have a better resistance profile such as adefovir dipivoxil or
entecavir. Recently, it has been shown that entecavir has
stronger antiviral activity compared with lamivudine and can
result in more profound suppression of viral replication. It
also has a better resistance profile with no evidence of
genotypic resistance in nucleoside analogue naı¨ve patients
after 48 weeks of therapy.39 Therefore, further clinical trials
with these agents or combination regimens with at least
additive or preferably synergistic effects as pre-emptive
therapy are warranted.40
One of the limitations of this study was the absence of a liver
biopsy before commencement of lamivudine or chemotherapy.
As Hong Kong is an endemic area for HBV infection, the most
common mode of HBV infection is perinatal transmission.41
Thus many of the HBsAg positive patients in this study are likely
to have been infected for four to five decades before developing
haematological malignancy. As the baseline serum ALT levels of
HBsAg positive patients are mostly within the normal range, it
is unlikely that these patients have severe hepatic necroin￾flammation.42 On the other hand, it is possible that some of
these patients had a more advanced stage of fibrosis at
presentation, accounting for the oesophageal varices in one of
the patients. This would be better characterised if baseline liver
biopsy for these patients were available. However, it would be
difficult to justify such a procedure in high risk patients with no
specific clinical indication, such as derangement of liver
function tests.
Finally, based on our experience and the currently
available data, we would recommend that all patients
undergoing intense cytotoxic chemotherapy be screened for
HBsAg. HBsAg positive patients should be started on pre￾emptive lamivudine one week before initiation of chemother￾apy, especially those at a higher risk of developing HBV
reactivation, those receiving steroid containing chemotherapy
or haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and those with a
high pre-chemotherapy serum HBV DNA, high intrahepatic
cccDNA, and HBeAg positivity.43–46 They should be closely
monitored every four weeks while on chemotherapy for
breakthrough hepatitis and HBV viral resistance. Pre-emptive
lamivudine should cover the entire duration of chemotherapy
and can be safely withdrawn in HBeAg negative patients with
low pre-chemotherapy serum HBV DNA once recovery of

white cell count has occurred. After withdrawal of pre￾emptive lamivudine, we recommend close monitoring of their
serum HBV DNA and aminotransaminase levels for evidence
of withdrawal flare every four weeks for the first 12 months.
Lamivudine should be resumed once a 1–log10 increase in
serum HBV DNA is detected. On the other hand, lamivudine
should be continued until HBeAg seroconversion is achieved
in HBeAg positive patients. Lamivudine should also be
continued for a more long time in HBeAg negative patients
with a pre-chemotherapy serum HBV DNA of >104 copies/ml
(fig 4).
In conclusion, a high pre-chemotherapy serum HBV DNA
is associated with an increased risk of HBV reactivation after
withdrawal of pre-emptive lamivudine. The optimal duration
of antiviral therapy may have to be prolonged in this
subgroup of patients, even after completion of chemotherapy.
Patients receiving pre-emptive chemotherapy should be
closely monitored for a prolonged period of time as HBV
reactivation leading to hepatic failure may still occur three
months after withdrawal of pre-emptive lamivudine.
