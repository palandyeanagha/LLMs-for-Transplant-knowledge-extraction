Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is characterized by steatosis and upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, 
including IL-1β. IL-1β, type I IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1), and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) are all important 
regulators of the IL-1 signaling complex, which plays a role in inflammation. Furthermore, IL-1β maturation 
is dependent on caspase-1 (Casp-1). Using IL-1Ra–treated mice as well as 3 mouse models deficient in regu￾lators of IL-1β activation (Casp-1 and ASC) or signaling (IL-1R1), we found that IL-1β signaling is required 
for the development of alcohol-induced liver steatosis, inflammation, and injury. Increased IL-1β was due to 
upregulation of Casp-1 activity and inflammasome activation. The pathogenic role of IL-1 signaling in ALD 
was attributable to the activation of the inflammasome in BM-derived Kupffer cells. Importantly, in vivo 
intervention with a recombinant IL-1Ra blocked IL-1 signaling and markedly attenuated alcohol-induced liver 
inflammation, steatosis, and damage. Furthermore, physiological doses of IL-1β induced steatosis, increased 
the inflammatory and prosteatotic chemokine MCP-1 in hepatocytes, and augmented TLR4-dependent 
upregulation of inflammatory signaling in macrophages. In conclusion, we demonstrated that Casp-1–depen￾dent upregulation of IL-1β and signaling mediated by IL-1R1 are crucial in ALD pathogenesis. Our findings 
suggest a potential role of IL-1R1 inhibition in the treatment of ALD.
Introduction
It is estimated that there are 17.6 million alcoholic individuals 
in the United States and 140 million worldwide. Although not 
all alcoholics develop symptomatic alcoholic liver disease (ALD), 
more than 12,000 deaths per year are attributed to ALD in the 
United States (1). The clinical spectrum of ALD includes alcoholic 
fatty liver, alcoholic steatohepatitis with or without fibrosis, cir￾rhosis, and hepatocellular cancer. Clinical observations suggest 
that steatosis and early phases of steatohepatitis are reversible; 
however, there is no definitive treatment available for any stages 
of the alcohol-related liver diseases. Short of abstinence, thera￾peutic options are limited, and even cessation of alcohol con￾sumption may not prevent the progression of alcohol-induced 
liver damage (1).
It has been proposed that activation of Kupffer cells (KCs), 
the resident liver macrophages, has a pivotal role in the 
inflammation associated with ALD (2, 3). Numerous studies 
have reported on the crucial role of KC-derived inflammatory 
cytokines in the pathogenesis of alcohol-induced steatosis, 
inflammation, and injury and emphasized the role of TNF-α as 
a central mediator of ALD (reviewed in ref. 4). However, human 
clinical trials with TNF-α blockade using anti-TNF antibodies 
were discontinued due to infectious complications (5). These 
studies suggested the need to search for inflammatory path￾ways amenable to therapeutic intervention without compro￾mising the immune status of the host.
IL-1β is a potent proinflammatory cytokine (6), whose levels 
are increased in patients with ALD (7). IL-1β is produced as inac￾tive pro–IL-1β (encoded by pro-Il-1b) in response to inflammatory 
stimuli, including both microbial products and endogenous dan￾ger-associated molecules. IL-1β gene expression and synthesis of 
pro–IL-1β occurs after activation of pattern recognition receptors 
(PRRs). Inflammatory stimuli also drive activation of cytosolic 
CARD and PYHIN domain–containing PRRs that recruit ASC 
and caspase-1 (Casp-1) to assemble into the multiprotein complex 
inflammasome. Pro–Casp-1 (encoded by pro-Casp-1), activated by 
the inflammasome, cleaves pro–IL-1β into the bioactive IL-1β (8). 
IL-1β acts in an autocrine/paracrine manner via the type I IL-1 
receptor (IL-1R1). Activation of IL-1R1 is inhibited by its bind￾ing to the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), a naturally occur￾ring cytokine whose function is to prevent the biologic response 
to IL-1. Treatment with IL-1Ra significantly improves symptoms 
in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (9) or autoinflammatory 
syndromes (6); unlike anti-TNF therapy, it is not associated with 
infectious complications (10).
Emerging data have provided evidence for the role of IL-1 sig￾naling in acute and chronic liver injury of diverse origin, includ￾ing acetaminophen-induced liver damage (11), nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis (12), liver fibrosis (13), and immune-mediated 
liver injury (14). However, the significance of IL-1 signaling in 
ALD has yet to be evaluated. Considering the critical importance 
of inflammatory activation in ALD (4) and the role of IL-1β
in innate immunity (6), we hypothesized that IL-1 signaling is 
critical in alcohol-induced liver pathology, including steatosis, 
inflammation, and hepatocyte damage. Given the differential 
input of parenchymal and nonparenchymal cells in the patho￾physiology of ALD, we further hypothesized that activation of 
the inflammasome and IL-1β may be critical in alcoholic liver 
injury in a cell-specific manner.

Here, we report that upregulation of cleaved active IL-1β in ALD 
was a Casp-1–dependent process and that inflammasome and IL-1 
signaling were required for the pathogenesis of alcohol-induced 
inflammation, steatosis, liver damage, and fibrosis. We further 
showed that the requirement for inflammasome activation and 
IL-1β in the pathogenesis of ALD was due to the presence of the 
inflammasome in liver immune cells and that pharmacological inhi￾bition of IL-1R1 using IL-1Ra ameliorated the development and pro￾gression of ALD. We also found that IL-1β amplified TLR4-induced 
inflammation. These findings, which we believe to be novel, suggest a 
therapeutic utility of IL-1 receptor blockade in the treatment of ALD.
Results
Inflammasome and IL-1β are activated in alcohol-induced liver injury. 
Although the role of proinflammatory cytokine production in 
ALD has been extensively investigated (reviewed in ref. 15), the 
importance of cleaved IL-1β is still unknown. To investigate 
whether IL-1β is activated in ALD, we fed ethanol or isocaloric 
control (pair feeding) diet to C57BL/6 WT mice. Histopathologi￾cal analysis revealed that chronic alcohol feeding induced steatosis 
(Oil-red-O staining) and liver damage (H&E and serum alanine 
aminotransferase [ALT]) in ethanol-fed mice (Figure 1A), sugges￾tive of ALD. Alcohol feeding significantly upregulated pro-IL-1b

sacrificed 4 weeks later. Liver samples were stained by H&E or Oil-red-O, and liver injury and steatosis was quantified by measuring serum ALT 
and Oil-red-O–positive areas, respectively (A). Expression of pro–IL-1β and pro–IL-1α in the liver was analyzed by qPCR (B) and ELISA (C). 
Secreted forms of IL-1β and IL-1α were measured in the serum using specific ELISA (D). Expression of pro-Casp-1, Asc, and Nlrp3 in the liver 
was measured using qPCR (E), and Casp-1 activity was measured using a colorimetric assay (F). Cleaved forms of Casp-1 (G) and IL-1β (H) in 
the livers were analyzed using antibodies that identify both full-length pro-form (short exposure, presented in linear contrast mode) and cleaved 
forms (long exposure, presented in sigmoidal contrast mode), and normalized to β-actin. See Supplemental Figure 1 for densitometric analysis.

mRNA (Figure 1B) and pro–IL-1β protein (Figure 1C) in the livers 
and increased secretion of IL-1β in the serum (Figure 1D) com￾pared with controls. There was no increase of IL-1α in the liver or 
serum of alcohol-fed mice (Figure 1, B–D).
IL-1β maturation and secretion is mediated by inflammasome￾dependent activation of Casp-1 (16). Real-time quantitative PCR 
(qPCR) analysis demonstrated that alcohol feeding significantly 
increased expression of the inflammasome components pro-Casp-1, 
Asc (which encodes ASC), and Nlrp3 (which encodes NALP3) in the 
liver (Figure 1E). Importantly, we found increased activity of Casp-1, 
the effector protein of the inflammasome, in livers of alcohol-fed 
compared with pair-fed mice (Figure 1F). This finding was support￾ed by significantly increased levels of the cleaved fragment of Casp-1 
(Figure 1G and Supplemental Figure 1; supplemental material

levels of IL-1β (E), TNF-α (F), IL-6 (G), MCP-1 (H), IL-10 (I), IL-18 (J), and IL-33 (K) were measured as described in Methods. Tissue levels of 
IL-10 (I; liver) were evaluated using immunoblotting (Supplemental Figure 3A). n = 6 (WT pair-fed); 11 (WT EtOH-fed); 3 (Casp-1–KO pair-fed); 7

of the cleaved form of IL-1β in the livers of alcohol-fed mice (Fig￾ure 1H and Supplemental Figure 1). Taken together, these findings 
suggest activation of the inflammasome and IL-1β in ALD.
In addition to cleavage of IL-1β, inflammasomes are also 
involved in processing of IL-18 and IL-33 (8). We observed that 
alcohol-fed mice showed upregulation of pro-Il-33 mRNA (Supple￾mental Figure 2A), pro–IL-33 protein, and the cleaved fragment 
of IL-33 in the liver (Supplemental Figure 2, C and D). In contrast 
to IL-1β, which was present mainly in the full-length form and 
underwent cleavage after ethanol administration (Figure 1H), the 
majority of IL-33 detected in the liver was cleaved, regardless of 
diet (Supplemental Figure 2C). In contrast to IL-1β or IL-33, we 
found no induction of IL-18 in the liver or serum of alcohol-fed 
mice (Supplemental Figure 2, B and D, and see below).
Deficiency of Casp-1 ameliorates alcoholic liver steatosis and injury and 
prevents alcoholic hepatitis and fibrosis. To further define the impor￾tance of Casp-1 activation in alcohol-induced liver injury, we fed 
ethanol or control diet to WT and Casp-1–KO mice. In contrast to 
WT mice, Casp-1–KO mice showed significant amelioration of the 
morphological features of ALD upon histological analysis (H&E 
and Oil-red-O; Figure 2, A and B) and demonstrated significant 
attenuation of liver injury, as documented by decreased serum ALT 
(Figure 2A).
Next, we examined the recruitment of KCs, a BM-derived 
cell population essential in the pathogenesis of ALD (2). 
Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that deficiency of Casp-1 
completely prevented increased accumulation of F4/80-positive 
KCs (Figure 2C) and CD3-positive lymphocytes (Figure 2D) in the 
liver compared with alcohol-fed WT controls. This finding sug￾gested a crucial role of Casp-1 in recruitment of myeloid and lym￾phoid cells to the liver. To further investigate liver inflammation, 
we analyzed cytokines involved in inflammation and cell recruit￾ment. Consistent with the critical role of Casp-1 in the cleavage 
and release of bioactive IL-1β, we found significantly lower serum 
levels of IL-1β in Casp-1–KO mice and no alcohol-mediated induc￾tion of IL-1β in the liver compared with WT mice (Figure 2E). Fur￾ther analysis demonstrated that deficiency of Casp-1 prevented 
increases in the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α (Figure 2F) 
and IL-6 (Figure 2G), the chemokine MCP-1 (Figure 2H), and the 
antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 (Figure 2I and Supplemental 
Figure 3A) compared with WT mice. These data support a central 
role of Casp-1 in alcohol-induced liver inflammation.
Consistent with our previous data (Supplemental Figure 2, A, 
B, and D), there was no increase of IL-18 in the serum or livers of 
alcohol-fed mice, although deficiency of Casp-1 globally decreased 
serum IL-18 compared with WT mice (Figure 2J). In contrast, we 
found that IL-33 was increased in both alcohol-fed WT and alco￾hol-fed Casp-1–KO mice (Figure 2K), which suggests that inflam￾masome-independent mechanisms cleave IL-33 in ALD.
Next, we analyzed the role of Casp-1 in alcohol-induced liver 
fibrosis. Casp-1–KO mice showed overt reduction of liver fibrosis, 
as indicated by Sirius red staining (Figure 3A) and by the expres￾sion of markers of fibrogenesis, including Tgfb1 (which encodes 
TGF-β; Figure 3B) and pro-Col1a1 (which encodes pro–collagen-α1; 
Figure 3C). To confirm the involvement of Casp-1 in alcoholic 
liver fibrosis, we analyzed a panel of serum markers of liver fibro￾sis, including procollagen III N-terminal propeptide (PIIINP; Fig￾ure 3D), tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP-1; 
Figure 3E), and hyaluronic acid (Figure 3F). Alcohol feeding signif￾icantly upregulated these markers only in WT mice, not in Casp-1–
KO animals (Figure 3, C–F).

fibrosis was evaluated by Sirius red staining (A) and by measuring expression of Tgfb1 (B) and pro-Col1a1 (C) by qPCR. Specific ELISA was 
used to evaluate serum markers of liver fibrosis, including PIIINP (D), TIMP-1 (E), and hyaluronic acid (F). n = 6 (WT pair-fed); 11 (WT EtOH-fed);

Taken together, these data demonstrated that Casp-1 was 
required for the cleavage of IL-1β in alcoholic livers and that Casp-1 
deficiency prevented immune cell recruitment as well as activa￾tion of inflammation and fibrosis and significantly ameliorated 
alcohol-induced liver steatosis and damage.
Deficiency in IL-1β activation in ASC-KO mice ameliorates ALD. 
In a majority of inflammasomes, activation of Casp-1 requires 
interaction with the adaptor protein ASC (8). Given our find￾ing that Asc expression was increased in livers of alcohol-fed 
mice (Figure 1E), we investigated its role in ALD using mice 
with genetic deficiency of ASC. In contrast to WT mice, ASC￾KO mice had attenuated alcohol-induced liver damage and ste￾atosis, as demonstrated by H&E, Oil-red-O staining, and serum 
ALT (Figure 4, A and B), an outcome similar to that of Casp-1–
KO mice (Figure 2, A and B). Moreover, deficiency of ASC pre￾vented upregulation of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1, and IL-10 
in the liver and in serum (Figure 4, C–G, and Supplemental 
Figure 3B) in alcohol-fed mice compared with alcohol-fed WT 
controls, supporting the crucial role of ASC in the pathogen￾esis of alcohol-induced inflammation. Alcohol feeding did not 
increase IL-18, whereas IL-33 showed upregulation in serum 
and liver in both WT and ASC-KO mice compared with pair-fed 
controls (Figure 4, H and I).
Deficiency in IL-1 signaling in IL-1R1–KO mice ameliorates ALD. Fol￾lowing its cleavage and release, IL-1β exerts its effects via IL-1R1 
(16). To investigate whether IL-1 signaling was required for the 
pathogenesis of ALD, we fed ethanol or control diet to WT and 
IL-1R1–KO mice. Contrary to WT mice, IL-1R1–KO mice showed 
significant amelioration of steatosis and liver injury, as deter￾mined by histological analysis, Oil-red-O staining, and measure￾ment of serum ALT (Figure 5, A and B). We also found no alco￾hol-induced increase of IL-1β (Figure 5C), TNF-α (Figure 5D), 
or MCP-1 (Figure 5E) in the serum and livers of IL-1R1–KO mice 
compared with pair-fed controls. This was in contrast to increased 
levels of all these cytokines in alcohol-fed WT mice (Figure 5, C–E). 
Taken together, these data demonstrated a critical role of IL-1R1 
in the pathogenesis of alcohol-induced liver inflammation, dam￾age, and steatosis. In the context of our data showing no induction 
of IL-1α (Figure 1, B–D) and IL-18 (Supplemental Figure 2, A, B, 
and D, Figure 2J, and Figure 4H) in ALD as well as Casp-1– and

Deficiency of ASC attenuates ALD. WT or ASC-KO mice were fed control or alcohol diet and sacrificed 4 weeks later. Liver injury was assessed

ASC-independent upregulation of IL-33 (Figure 2K and Figure 4I) 
in alcohol-fed mice, our findings indicate that the predominant 
pathogenic effect of inflammasome in ALD is mediated by IL-1β.
Pharmacologic intervention via inhibition of IL-1 signaling with IL-1Ra 
ameliorates ALD development and progression. The activity of IL-1 
signaling is tightly regulated by IL-1Ra, a natural endogenous 
antagonist of the proinflammatory IL-1β. IL-1Ra competes with 
both IL-1α and IL-1β at the receptor level to block IL-1R1 signal￾ing (16). We observed that alcohol feeding increased endogenous 
IL-1Ra protein levels in both liver (Figure 6A) and serum (Figure 
6B) of alcohol-fed mice.
To evaluate whether pharmacological blocking of IL-1R1 has 
a protective effect in ALD, we took advantage of recombinant 
human IL-1Ra (anakinra). We sought to achieve pharmacokinet￾ics of recombinant IL-1Ra similar to that observed in humans, in 
whom administration of IL-1Ra at 1.5 mg/kg demonstrates a half￾life of 2–3 hours and therapeutic serum levels that are detectable 
6–12 hours after injection (17). These parameters were achieved 
after administration of 10 or 25 mg/kg i.p. in our mouse model 
(Figure 6, C and D). The dose of 1.5 mg/kg, used in humans, 
resulted in a 30-minute half-life after i.p. administration (Figure 
6C), most likely due to the pronounced renal accumulation (Fig￾ure 6D) and rapid elimination of IL-1Ra in rodents (18).
Next, we treated WT mice with daily i.p. injections of 1.5, 10, or 
25 mg/kg IL-1Ra along with a 4-week feeding with alcohol diet 
and found that 10 or 25 mg/kg/d recombinant IL-1Ra signifi￾cantly ameliorated alcohol-induced liver steatosis and damage 
(Figure 6, E–G). All 3 doses of IL-1Ra significantly attenuated 
serum levels of the fibrosis marker PIIINP (Figure 6H). Treat￾ment with IL-1Ra at 25 mg/kg showed superior protection from 
alcohol-induced ALT increase compared with 10 or 1.5 mg/kg 
(P = 0.045 vs. 10 mg/kg, P = 0.007 vs. 1.5 mg/kg; Figure 6E). 
Administration of IL-1Ra also dose-dependently decreased lev￾els of IL-1β (Figure 6I), TNF-α (Figure 6J), and MCP-1 (Figure 
6K) in the serum of alcohol-fed mice compared with saline-treat￾ed alcohol-fed controls. All 3 tested doses of IL-1Ra prevented 
upregulation of IL-1β, TNF-α, and MCP-1 protein in the liver 
of alcohol-fed mice (Figure 6, L–N). These data demonstrated 
that administration of IL-1Ra could achieve the extent of pro￾tection from ALD observed in Casp-1–, ASC-, and IL-1R1–KO 
mice (Figures 2–5). This protective effect required administra￾tion of active IL-1Ra, as administration of heat-inactivated 
IL-1Ra did not ameliorate alcohol-induced liver steatosis, dam￾age, or inflammation (Supplemental Figure 4).
To reflect the clinical scenario in which most patients present 
with alcoholic hepatitis superimposed on established ALD (1), we 
first fed WT mice with Lieber-DeCarli ethanol or control diet for 
2 weeks to allow development of ALD and then initiated i.p. treat￾ment with 25 mg/kg/d IL-1Ra or saline for the last 2 weeks of feed￾ing, while still maintaining the alcohol diet. Treatment of estab￾lished ALD with IL-1Ra prevented progression of alcohol-induced 
liver damage (ALT increase) and steatosis (Figure 7, A and B). Simi￾lar protection was achieved when the 2-week IL-1Ra treatment was 
initiated after the initial 4 weeks of alcohol feeding (Figure 7C).
Next, we asked whether IL-1Ra can prevent progression of ongo￾ing alcohol-induced liver injury for a prolonged period of time. We 
fed WT mice with ethanol or control diet for 2 weeks, then initiated 
daily treatment with IL-1Ra or saline and continued the alcohol 
diet for 5 additional weeks (7 weeks total duration). Alcohol-fed 
mice treated with IL-1Ra showed significantly lower levels of serum 
ALT at all investigated time points (Figure 7D) and showed signifi￾cantly improved survival compared with saline-treated, alcohol-fed 
Figure 5
Deficiency in IL-1 signaling in IL-1R1–KOs ameliorates ALD. WT or IL-1R1–KO mice were fed control (n = 5 per genotype) or alcohol (n = 10

Oil-red-O staining (B). Serum and liver levels of IL-1β (C), TNF-α (D), and MCP-1 (E) were measured using specific ELISA. Numbers in graphs

controls (48% survival at 7 weeks in alcohol-fed, IL-1Ra–treated, 
vs. 23% in alcohol-fed, saline-treated; P = 0.036). At the conclu￾sion of the experiment, IL-1Ra–treated mice showed a substan￾tially improved histological picture of ALD (H&E and Oil-red-O) 
compared with alcohol-fed, saline-treated mice (Figure 7E). Daily 
administration of IL-1Ra significantly inhibited progression of 
alcohol-induced liver injury for 4 of the 5 weeks of IL-1Ra treat￾ment (P = 0.243, P = 0.851, P = 0.311, and P = 0.006 for ALT weeks 
4, 5, 6, and 7, respectively, vs. ALT week 2 in alcohol-fed, IL-1Ra–
treated mice; Figure 7D).
Finally, we investigated the role of IL-1R1 blockade on the recov￾ery from acute-on-chronic alcohol liver injury. In this model, WT 
mice were fed Lieber-DeCarli ethanol or control diet for 4 weeks to 
allow development of ALD and received 3 acute doses of ethanol 
via gastric gavage during the last 3 days of alcohol feeding (Figure 
8A). Subsequently, all mice were transferred to the control diet and 
started on daily treatment with IL-1Ra or saline. Saline-treated mice 
recovered from liver injury at day 4, whereas animals treated with 
IL-1Ra showed normal ALT after only 2 days (Figure 8A). Simi￾larly, administration of IL-1Ra was associated with substantially 
improved liver histology on day 2 (H&E; Figure 8B) compared with 
saline-treated mice. We could not evaluate the role of IL-1Ra on lipid 
accumulation in this model due to the fact that all mice showed 
almost complete regression of steatosis on Oil-red-O staining in less 
than 48 hours after conversion to the control diet (Figure 8B).
Collectively, these data suggested that inflammasome and 
IL-1β drive the pathogenesis of alcohol-induced liver inflamma￾tion, steatosis, damage, and fibrosis and that therapy with IL-1Ra 
attenuates the development of ALD, protects from progression of 
alcohol-induced steatosis and liver damage, and facilitates recov￾ery from acute-on-chronic alcoholic liver injury.
Cell-specific role of the inflammasome in ALD. The liver represents a 
complex coexistence of parenchymal and nonparenchymal cells. To 
identify the cell population responsible for the pathogenic effects 
of Casp-1 and IL-1β in ALD, we isolated primary hepatocytes and 
liver mononuclear cells (LMNCs) from the livers of WT mice. 
Baseline levels of Casp-1 were substantially higher in LMNCs than 
in hepatocytes (Figure 9A). Similarly, baseline expression of pro￾Casp-1, Asc, Nlrp3, and pro-Il-1b mRNA was approximately 20-fold 
higher in LMNCs than in primary hepatocytes (Figure 9B). Analy￾sis of LMNCs and primary hepatocytes isolated from alcohol-fed 
mice treated with saline or LPS prior to sacrifice showed that alco￾hol or LPS induced increases in the cleaved fragment of Casp-1 
and IL-1β in LMNCs, but not in primary hepatocytes (Figure 9, 
C–E). These data suggest that LMNCs are the predominant cells 
that activate Casp-1 and IL-1β in ALD.
To explore whether KCs mediate the pathogenic effects of the 
inflammasome in ALD, we generated Casp-1–chimeric mice using 
a combination of clodronate-mediated KC depletion, irradia￾tion, and BM transplantation (BMT). This protocol achieves full 
depletion of KC in acceptor livers (Supplemental Figure 5) and 
greater than 90% reconstitution of BM-derived cells (19). Success￾ful BMT was further supported by serum levels of IL-1β that were 
significantly lower in recipients of Casp-1–KO BM compared with 
recipients of WT BM (Figure 9J). Using this protocol, we gener￾ated reciprocal chimeras by transplanting WT BM into clodro￾nate-pretreated, irradiated Casp-1–KO mice (referred to herein 
as Casp-1–KO/WT-BM) or by transplanting Casp-1–KO BM into 
clodronate-pretreated, irradiated WT mice (WT/Casp-1–KO–BM). 
Clodronate-pretreated, irradiated WT mice transplanted with WT 
BM (WT/WT-BM) served as controls.
WT/WT-BM mice developed significant liver injury, steatosis, 
and inflammatory cytokine activation after 4 weeks of alcohol diet 
feeding compared with pair-fed controls (Figure 9, F–L). Compared 
with WT/WT-BM mice, WT/Casp-1–KO-BM mice showed signifi￾cant amelioration of ALD, as indicated by liver histology (H&E; 
Figure 9F), Oil-red-O staining for lipids (Figure 9, G and I), and 
decreased serum ALT (Figure 9H). The attenuated liver injury and 
steatosis in WT/Casp-1–KO–BM mice was accompanied by a signif￾icant decrease in serum concentrations of IL-1β (Figure 9J), TNF-α
(Figure 9K), and MCP-1 (Figure 9L). The extent of protection from 
alcohol-induced liver injury, steatosis, and inflammation in WT/
Casp-1–KO–BM mice (Figure 9, F–I) was comparable to the extent 
of protection observed in the global Casp-1–KO animals (Figure 2, 
A and B), which supports the hypothesis that the pathogenic role 
of inflammasome in ALD is specific to KCs. In contrast, Casp-1–
KO/WT-BM mice showed no significant protection from alcohol￾induced liver damage, steatosis, and induction of inflammatory 
cytokines compared with WT/WT-BM mice (Figure 9, F–L).
These data suggested that Casp-1 expressed in KCs was involved 
in alcohol-induced liver inflammation, steatosis, and injury and 
did not support a significant pathogenic role for Casp-1 in paren￾chymal cells in the development of ALD. In the context of our 
data demonstrating a crucial role of IL-1R1 in ALD, the absence 
of ethanol-mediated induction of IL-1α or IL-18 in the liver or 
serum, and inflammasome-independent induction of IL-33, our 
findings collectively demonstrated that the pathogenic effect of 
the inflammasome in ALD is driven by KCs and mediated by IL-1β
in an autocrine/paracrine manner.
Physiological concentrations of IL-1β exert biological effects in macro￾phages and hepatocytes. Finally, we asked whether the low concentra￾tions of IL-1β observed in the serum of alcohol-fed mice (ranging 
15–80 pg/ml; Figure 1D, Figure 2E, Figure 4C, Figure 5C, Figure 
6I, and Figure 9J) were sufficient to exert pathogenic effects. We 
investigated the role of IL-1β in the context of TLR4-mediated 
induction of inflammatory cytokines. Essential for the pathogen￾esis of ALD (20), TLR4 signaling is activated by gut-derived LPS 
that increases in the serum after alcohol feeding (21), activates 
nuclear transcription factors including NF-κB, and upregulates 
production of inflammatory mediators (reviewed in ref. 15). Given 
the partial overlap of signaling pathways downstream of TLR4 and 
IL-1R1 (22), we hypothesized that IL-1β augments TLR4-depen￾dent signaling in immune cells.

maximum extent of lipid accumulation was substantially higher 
in cells stimulated with MCP-1 compared with IL-1β (Figure 10D). 
However, the steatogenic effect of MCP-1 was observed only at sup￾raphysiological concentrations (greater than 10,000 pg/ml), where￾as IL-1β induced lipid accumulation at doses comparable to the 
concentrations of IL-1β observed in the serum in vivo after chronic 
alcohol administration (less than 100 pg/ml; Figure 1D, Figure 2E, 
Figure 4C, Figure 5C, Figure 6I, and Figure 9J).
Taken together, these data further support the hypothesis that 
IL-1β exerts significant effects on immune cells and hepatocytes at 
concentrations observed in vivo and therefore represents a crucial 
determinant in the pathogenesis of alcohol-induced liver inflam￾mation, steatosis, and damage.
Discussion
ALD is tightly linked to liver inflammation and steatosis in 
humans as well as in experimental models (25). Here we have 
shown that activated inflammasome and IL-1β drive the patho￾genesis of alcohol-induced liver inflammation, steatosis, injury, 
and fibrogenesis and that the pathogenic effect of inflammasome 
and IL-1β is KC specific. We demonstrated, for the first time to 
our knowledge, that Casp-1 was involved in IL-1β activation in 
ALD and that deficiency in Casp-1, ASC, or IL-1R1 consistently 
prevented alcoholic hepatitis and significantly attenuated alcohol￾induced steatosis and liver damage. In addition, we demonstrated 
that pharmacological inhibition of IL-1 signaling had protective 
effects in various stages of ALD, including development and pro￾Using immortalized murine macrophages, we observed that 
recombinant IL-1β dose-dependently increased production of 
the NF-κB–dependent inflammatory cytokine TNF-α, and a sig￾nificant effect of IL-1β was observed at concentrations as low as 
5 pg/ml (Figure 10A). Furthermore, very low doses (1–25 pg/ml) of 
IL-1β synergistically augmented production of TNF-α in murine 
macrophages stimulated with low doses of LPS (Figure 10B). This 
finding is supported by previous studies showing that IL-1 signal￾ing is required for the full expression of NF-κB–induced inflam￾matory cytokines in human leukocytes (17, 23) and consistent 
with our in vivo data that KC-specific deficiency of Casp-1 (Figure 
9, J–L), global deficiency of ASC (Figure 4, C–I) or IL-1R1 (Figure 5, 
C–E), or pharmacological blocking of IL-1R1 (Figure 6, I–N) inhib￾ited upregulation of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, and MCP-1 in ALD. 
Taken together, our results strongly support the crucial role of the 
inflammasome and IL-1 signaling in positive feed-forward induc￾tion of IL-1β and other LPS-inducible inflammatory cytokines 
(17) in the context of ALD.
Our previous data demonstrated that low doses of IL-1β sensitize 
primary mouse hepatocytes to TNF-α–induced cytotoxicity (14). 
We also found that stimulation of primary WT hepatocytes with 
IL-1β induced a significant increase in the production of MCP-1 
(Figure 10C). MCP-1 is a chemokine required for the pathogenesis 
of ALD (24) that, when present in high doses, induces lipid accu￾mulation in hepatocytes (12). To assess the steatogenic potential of 
IL-1β and MCP-1, we evaluated their respective effects on triglyc￾eride accumulation in isolated hepatocytes and observed that the

(A) and H&E staining (B), and steatosis was evaluated by Oil-red-O 
staining (B). n = 3–5 per time point and treatment. *P < 0.05 vs. base￾line. Original magnification, ×200.

and in the pathogenesis of ALD (2, 3, 20). Our data and reports of 
others demonstrate that the mechanisms by which IL-1β exerts 
its pathogenic effects involve sensitization of hepatocytes to 
cytotoxicity induced by TNF-α (14, 29), upregulation of lipid syn￾thesis in hepatocytes (12), activation of hepatic stellate cells (30), 
maintenance of macrophages in inflammatory state (31), and 
feed-forward induction of LPS-inducible inflammatory cytokines 
(17), such as TNF-α or MCP-1, that are crucial in ALD (24, 32). 
Our results also demonstrated that even very low concentrations 
of IL-1β exerted significant biological effects on hepatocytes and 
macrophages, thus giving additional support to the crucial role 
of IL-1β in ALD, even at the relatively low absolute serum levels of 
IL-1β in vivo. Moreover, our findings suggest a novel IL-1β–depen￾dent self-sustaining mechanism that amplifies inflammatory sig￾naling in the liver after alcohol abuse.
The liver is a main target of gut-derived bacterial products, and 
the rate of translocation of bacterial endotoxin (LPS) increases in 
individuals drinking alcohol (ref. 21 and G. Szabo, unpublished 
observations) and in animal models of ALD (33). Thus, translo￾cated LPS provides the first signal for TLR4-mediated upregulation 
of inflammatory mediators, such as TNF-α, pro-IL-1β, and MCP-1. 
However, the nature of the second signal required for the activation 
of inflammasome and IL-1β in ALD is unclear. Our data demon￾strated the crucial role of ASC in ALD, narrowing the inflamma￾some candidates to the ASC-dependent NALP3 and AIM2 inflam￾masomes (8). Activators of the NALP3 inflammasome involve 
host-derived molecules indicative of injury (such as extracellular 
ATP and hyaluronic acid), signs of metabolic stress (including 
elevated extracellular glucose), and particulate substances (such 
as uric acid crystals), whereas activators of AIM2 inflammasome 
include cytosolic double-stranded DNA (reviewed in ref. 8). Indeed, 
mitochondrial dysfunction with disturbances of ATP homeostasis 
have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ALD (34, 35), which is 
consistent with our animal data showing alcohol-induced increase 
in serum ATP and upregulation of the ATP-conducting channel 
pannexin-1 in the liver (Supplemental Figure 6). In addition, we 
showed here that the extracellular concentration of hyaluronic acid 
gression of ALD and recovery from acute-on-chronic alcoholic 
liver injury. Based on these findings, we have identified inflamma￾some and IL-1β as potential therapeutic targets in ALD.
Although Casp-1 cleaves IL-1β, IL-18, and IL-33 (8), and IL-1R1 
recognizes IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-1Ra (16), our study provides several 
lines of evidence that IL-1β — not IL-18, IL-33, or IL-1α — is the 
primary cytokine that mediates the pathogenic effects of activated 
inflammasome in ALD. First, alcohol administration in mice sig￾nificantly increased IL-1β and IL-33, whereas levels of IL-1α and 
IL-18 remained unchanged. Furthermore, our studies showed 
that Casp-1 and ASC were required for cleavage and activation of 
IL-1β in ALD, in contrast to inflammasome-independent cleavage 
of IL-33. Second, IL-1β exerted its effects through paracrine sig￾naling, which is considered to be the primary mode of interaction 
between immune cells and parenchymal cells in the liver (4, 15, 26). 
In contrast, IL-1α is a membrane-bound autocrine growth factor 
that does not require inflammasome activation (16). Consistent 
with this, we found no upregulation or secretion of IL-1α in ALD. 
Finally, genetic deficiency or pharmacological blockade of IL-1R1 
ameliorated alcohol-induced liver steatosis, inflammation, and 
damage to the same extent as global deficiency of Casp-1 or ASC or 
KC-specific deficiency of Casp-1, strongly supporting the evidence 
that the pathogenic effect of inflammasome in ALD is mediated 
via KC-derived IL-1β by way of paracrine signaling. However, we 
cannot completely exclude an IL-1R1–independent contribution 
of IL-1α or an inflammasome-independent effect of IL-33 in ALD. 
For example, nuclear translocation of IL-1α that serves as an intra￾crine activator of proinflammatory responses (27), or induction of 
Th2-immune responses by IL-33 (28), may contribute to ALD.
A number of cell types, including epithelial and immune cells, 
express Casp-1. We showed that the protection from alcohol￾induced liver inflammation, steatosis, and damage observed in 
mice with global deficiency of Casp-1 was attributable to Casp-1 
expressed in KCs. This finding was consistent with reports dem￾onstrating that Casp-1 is indispensable for cleavage and activa￾tion of IL-1β in macrophages (reviewed in ref. 8) and with data 
demonstrating a crucial role of KCs in response to gut-derived LPS

48 hours after clodronate injection using F4/80 staining (CI:A3-1; AbD 
Serotec) and compared with that in mice injected with control PBS lipo￾somes (Supplemental Figure 5). Success of BMT was confirmed by measur￾ing IL-1β in the serum (Figure 9J), serving as a marker for Casp-1 activity.
Sample storage. Serum was stored at –80°C. Livers were snap-frozen in liq￾uid nitrogen for proteins, frozen in TissueTek for Oil-red-O analysis (Sakura 
Finetek USA Inc.), stored in RNAlater (Qiagen GmbH) for RNA extraction, 
or fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for histopathological analysis.
Biochemical assays. Serum ALT was determined using a kinetic method 
(D-Tek LLC). Serum ATP was measured using the bioluminescence kit 
from Promega. Colorimetric assay (R&D Systems Inc.) was used to mea￾sure the activity of Casp-1 in the liver.
Cytokine measurement. Levels of IL-1β, IL-1α, IL-33, TIMP-1, hyaluronic 
acid, and endogenous IL-1Ra in the tissues and serum were measured 
using specific anti-mouse ELISAs, and the exogenously administered 
IL-1Ra was measured using specific ELISA recognizing human IL-1Ra 
(R&D systems Inc.). TNF-α, IL-6, and MCP-1 in the serum and in the liv￾ers as well as serum IL-10 was measured using ELISA from Biolegend Inc. 
Due to high background signal, ELISA could not be used for detection of 
IL-10 in liver. Serum and liver IL-18 was measured using ELISA from MBL 
International; TNF-α in cell culture supernatants was measured using 
ELISA from BD Biosciences; and we used ELISA from Novatein Biosci￾ences to measure PIIINP.
Protein quantification. Whole-cell lysates were extracted from liver, as 
described previously (40). Equal amounts of proteins were separated on 
polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Target 
proteins were detected by Western blot and immunostaining with specific 
primary antibody, followed by horseradish peroxidase–labeled secondary 
antibody. The specific immunoreactive bands of interest were detected by 
chemiluminescence (Amersham). Digital system (ImageQuant LAS 4000; 
GE Healthcare) was used for image acquisition. Antibodies specific for 
IL-1β (catalog no. 30311) and for IL-33 (catalog no. 396118) were from 
R&D Systems Inc. The IL-18 antibody (catalog no. 39-3F) was purchased 
from MBL International, and antibodies specific for IL-10 (catalog no. 
NYRmIL-10) and Casp-1 (catalog no. M20) were from Santa Cruz Biotech￾nology. β-Actin antibody (catalog no. 8229) was from Abcam.
RNA analysis. RNA was purified using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen Sciences) 
and on-column DNA digestion. cDNA was transcribed with the Reverse 
Transcription System (Promega Corp.). qPCR was performed using 
Sybr-Green and iCycler from BioRad (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.); primer 
sequences and reaction conditions are shown in Supplemental Table 1.
Histopathological analysis. Liver sections were stained with H&E, Oil-red-O, 
or Sirius red and analyzed by microscopy, as we previously described (40). 
Immunohistochemistry staining for F4/80 (CI:A3-1; AbD Serotec) or CD3 
(SP7; ThermoFisher) was performed in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded 
livers according to the manufacturer’s instructions. ImageJ (NIH) was used 
for image analysis.
Isolation of primary mouse hepatocytes and LMNCs. Anesthetized ani￾mals were perfused by way of portal vein with saline solution followed 
by enzymatic digestion as described previously (40). Hepatocytes were 
separated by centrifugation; LMNCs were purified by centrifugation in 
Percoll gradient.
In vitro experiments. Primary hepatocytes were cultured in Dulbecco modi￾fied Eagle medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% insulin, trans￾ferrin, selenium (ITS) solution. Primary hepatocytes were seeded in 6-well 
collagen-coated plates. Before starting stimulation experiments, hepatocytes 
were rested for 4 hours. Subsequently, culture media was replaced, and stim￾ulation was performed as indicated in the figure legends. RAW264.7 mac￾rophages were stimulated with LPS (Sigma-Aldrich). Recombinant murine 
IL-1β and MCP-1 proteins were purchased from R&D Systems.
increased in alcohol-fed mice (Figure 3F). AIM2 inflammasome 
activation by modified self DNA from apoptotic hepatocytes as a 
damage-associated endogenous signal in ALD cannot be ruled out. 
Detailed investigation of mechanisms involved in inflammasome 
activation in ALD is beyond the scope of this study and will be the 
subject of our future research.
The presence of IL-1Ra, an endogenous inhibitor of IL-1R1, is 
a unique regulatory feature that has not been observed in other 
cytokines (16). Our finding that IL-1Ra was increased in ALD, 
which we believe to be novel, suggests that IL-1 signaling in the liver 
is under a tight endogenous control. Our data showed a protective 
effect of IL-1Ra in the development of ALD. A protective effect of 
the blockade of IL-1 signaling has also been shown in TLR9-asso￾ciated liver injury (14), recovery after partial hepatectomy in mice 
(36), and liver failure induced by d-galactosamine (37). Moreover, we 
demonstrated, for the first time to our knowledge, that administra￾tion of IL-1Ra inhibited progression of already established ALD and 
facilitated recovery from acute-on-chronic alcoholic liver injury, a 
scenario observed in the majority of patients presenting with acute 
alcoholic hepatitis (1). In contrast to anti-TNF approaches, whose 
utility was compromised by infectious complications (1, 5), admin￾istration of IL-1Ra has demonstrated an excellent safety profile, and 
its use has not been associated with adverse reactions or superinfec￾tions with long-term treatment in patients with rheumatoid arthri￾tis (38) or in acute settings in patients with sepsis (10).
In conclusion, our data demonstrated that signaling mediated 
by IL-1β was crucial in the pathogenesis of alcohol-induced liver 
inflammation, steatosis, and injury in a cell-specific manner. Fur￾thermore, our findings suggest that inflammasome activation may 
represent a new pathway in the pathogenesis of ALD. Finally, our 
data support the potential role of IL-1Ra in the treatment of ALD.
Methods
Animal studies. 6- to 8-week-old female C57BL/6 WT and IL-1R1–KO mice 
(Jackson Laboratory), and Casp-1–KO and ASC-KO mice (gift of A. Hise, 
Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA), were used. Some 
animals were fed the Lieber-DeCarli ad libitum diet (Dyets Inc.) with 5% 
(vol/vol) ethanol (36% ethanol-derived calories) for 4–7 weeks; pair-fed 
control mice matched the alcohol-derived calories with dextran-maltose. 
Specifically, mice received fresh Lieber-DeCarli diet in 50-ml feeders daily 
between 7 pm and 8 pm. At the conclusion of the experiment, we collected 
blood and harvested livers between 8 am and 9 am. Intragastric administra￾tion of ethanol (5 g/kg body weight), or isocaloric dextran-maltose, was 
performed in some mice using 22-gauge stainless steel feeding tubes. Some 
mice were treated with recombinant human IL-1Ra (1.5, 10, or 25 mg/kg) 
or saline i.p. every 24 hours (anakinra; Amgen), and IL-1Ra treatment was 
ongoing until the end of experiment. In a pilot experiment, nonspecific 
effects were excluded by heat inactivation of IL-1Ra (39).
BMT protocol. BM was collected from the long bones of 8-week-old donor 
male mice by flushing with a 25-gauge needle, then passed through a cell 
strainer to remove clumps. Female mice were injected with 200 μl liposo￾mal clodronate (purchased from N. van Rooijen, Free University Amster￾dam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) via tail vein injection. 24 hours later, 
mice were irradiated (9 Gy) from a Cesium irradiator (Gammacell 40; 
Atomic Energy of Canada), then 4 hours later transplanted with 5 × 106
freshly isolated donor BM cells via a single tail vein injection. Transplanted 
mice were housed in microisolator cages and placed on medicated water 
(sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim; Hi-Tech Pharmacal Inc.) until engraft￾ment was complete 6 weeks later. After engraftment, feeding with Lieber￾DeCarli diet was initiated. Depletion of KCs in acceptor livers was assessed
