The albumin–bilirubin (ALBI) score is calculated using only serum albumin and bilirubin levels, and was 
developed as a simple method to assess hepatic function. In this study, a total of 409 patients with 
primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) were enrolled between March 1990 and October 2018. The predictive 
performances of the ALBI score and other well-established prognostic scores were compared using 
time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. During the follow-up period, 60 
patients died, 45 due to liver-related diseases and 15 due to non-liver-related diseases, and 16 patients 
underwent liver transplantation. Time-dependent ROC analysis showed that the ALBI score has 
higher the areas under the ROC curves (AUROCs) than the Child–Pugh (C–P) score at each time point; 
AUROCs at 3, 5, and 10 years after the start of follow-up were 0.94, 0.91, and 0.90 for the ALBI score, 
and 0.89, 0.88, and 0.82 for the C–P score, respectively. The ALBI score showed the highest AUROCs 
within 2 years after the start of observation; beyond 2 years, however, the Mayo score had better 
prognostic ability for mortality and liver transplantation. The ALBI score/grade, derived from objective 
blood tests, and the Mayo score were superior prognostic tools in PBC patients.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune chronic liver disease, which is characterized by destruction 
of the intrahepatic bile ducts, resulting in cholestasis and progressive fibrosis. The majority of PBC patients are 
asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis, and the clinical course is typically slow and progressive, but can differ 
significantly among individuals1,2
. Although the overall 5-year survival rate of patients with PBC is 80–90%, a 
significant proportion of patients suffer from cirrhosis-related complications or hepatic malignancies3,4
.
To distinguish patients at high risk of developing complications, several non-invasive prognostic markers 
have been used in patients with PBC, such as the Child–Pugh (C–P) score/classification, the model of end-stage 
liver disease (MELD), the Mayo risk score, and the Newcastle model5–8
. All of these markers include the serum 
bilirubin level; in fact, the guidelines of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) state 
that serum bilirubin level is the most important factor for predicting prognosis in patients with PBC1
.
The C–P classification system is one of the most commonly used methods worldwide for assessing hepatic 
function9
. However, the C–P score/classification system includes subjective components, such as ascites and 
encephalopathy, and interrelated factors such as serum albumin and ascites. Recently, a simple new method was 
developed to assess hepatic function; known as the albumin–bilirubin (ALBI) score/grade, it is calculated using 
only serum albumin and bilirubin values10.
However, it is not yet clear whether the ALBI score/grade can serve as a novel biomarker capable of predicting 
prognosis in patients with PBC. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the impact of several serum prognostic 
markers, including the ALBI score/grade, for predicting the prognosis of Japanese patients with PBC in the short 
and long term, using time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.
Results
Patient characteristics. The characteristics of the study patients are shown in Table 1. The mean age was 
59.5 years, and there was a predominance of females (83.4%). The mean values of the ALBI score, C–P score, 
Mayo risk score, MELD score, and FIB-4 index were−2.59, 5.9, 5.10, 8.06, and 2.26, respectively. The mean 
follow-up period was 8.8  years. Almost all patients (n=379, 92.7%) were treated with ursodeoxycholic acid 
(UDCA; 600–900  mg/per day), and 41 patients (10.0%) who have already underwent the UDCA treatment 
at the start of follow-up. In addition, 122 (29.8%) patients underwent treatment with bezafibrate and 5 (1.2%) 
received corticosteroids. These five patients were treated with corticosteroids due to the comorbidities (rheu￾matoid arthritis, n=3; Sjögren’s syndrome, n=1; and aplastic anemia, n=1). One hundred eighty-five (45.2%) 
had the history of liver biopsy, and Scheuer’s stage was I for 138 cases (74.6%), II for 31 cases (16.8%), III for 14 
cases (7.57%), and IV for 2 cases (1.1%). Only 19 patients (4.6%) with a history of HCC met the Milan Criteria 
or experienced a complete cure. During the follow-up period, 60 (14.7%) patients died, 45 due to liver-related 
disease and 15 due to non-liver related disease, and 16 (3.9%) patients underwent liver transplantation.
Cumulative survival rate, incidence rates of death and liver transplantation, and causes of 
death. The overall and liver transplantation-free survival rates of patients at 5, 10, 15, and 20 years were 
87.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 83.9–90.8%), 80.0% (95% CI, 74.9–84.2%), 73.9% (95% CI, 67.6–79.2%), 
and 70.5% (95% CI, 63.2–76.6%), respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1 online). The 1-, 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year 
cumulative incidence rates of all-cause death were 2.3% (95% CI, 1.1–4.1%), 8.3% (95% CI, 5.7–11.5%), 16.1 
(95% CI, 12.0–20.7%), 21.7 (95% CI, 16.4–27.4%), and 25.0% (95% CI, 18.8–31.8); those of liver transplantation 
were 2.8% (95% CI, 1.5–4.7%), 3.9% (95% CI, 2.3–6.2%), 3.9% (95% CI, 2.3–6.2%), 4.4% (95% CI, 2.6–7.0%), 
and 4.4% (95% CI, 2.6–7.0%) (Fig. 1a). The 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year cumulative incidence rates of liver-related 
death were 6.2% (95% CI, 3.9–9.1%), 13.8% (95% CI, 9.9–18.3%), 16.0% (95% CI, 11.5–21.1%), and 19.5% (95% 
CI, 13.8–26.0%); those of non-liver-related death were 2.4% (1.1–4.5%), 2.9% (95% CI, 1.4–5.2%), 6.5% (95% CI, 
3.5–10.9%), and 6.5% (95% CI, 3.5–10.9%) (Fig. 1b). Of patients with liver-related deaths, 13 died due to HCC 
and 32 died due to liver cirrhosis-related complications other than HCC. In the remaining 17 patients with non￾liver-related deaths, nine died due to extra-hepatic malignancies and eight died of other causes (Supplementary 
Table S2. online).
Factors associated with prognosis by Fine‑Grey proportional hazards models. Table 2 shows 
that the following parameters were selected as significant risk factors: age, C–P score, ALBI score, FIB-4 index, 
MELD score, and Mayo risk score for liver-related death and liver transplantation; age, male, C–P score, ALBI 
score, FIB-4 index, and Mayo risk score for non liver-related death. Univariate analysis with Fine-Grey propor￾tion hazards model showed most of prognostic factors used in this study were selected as independent risk fac￾tors associated both liver-/non liver-related deaths in PBC.
Time‑dependent ROC analysis for overall survival and the incidence of liver transplanta‑ tion. Figure 2 shows the plots of AUROCs for the ALBI score, C–P score, FIB-4 index, Mayo score, and 
MELD score for patient overall and liver transplantation-free survival from 1 to 10 years after the start of follow￾up. The detailed ROC curves for each marker after the start of follow-up, obtained using time-dependent ROC 
analysis, are shown in Supplementary Fig. S3 online. Time-dependent ROC analysis showed that the predictive 
power of the ALBI score for overall mortality and the incidence of liver transplantation was superior to that of 
the C–P score for all years; the AUROCs at 3, 5, 7, and 10 years after the start of follow-up were 0.941, 0.906,

respectively (Fig. 3a). In addition, in patients categorized as C–P class A (n=321), B (n=62), and C (n=26), the 
survival and liver transplantation-free rates were 97.3% (95% CI, 94.4–98.7%), 65.0% (95% CI, 51.0–75.9%), and 
27.5% (95% CI, 11.4–46.4%) at 5 years, 91.2% (95% CI, 86.2–94.4%), 51.7% (95% CI, 36.5–65.0%), and 14.6%

(95% CI, 3.1–34.5%) at 15 years, respectively (Fig. 3b). Both the ALBI grade and C–P classification showed good 
discriminatory ability for prognosis (mortality and liver transplantation). However, the AIC of the ALBI grade 
was better than that of the C–P classification (708.96 vs. 720.37, respectively).
Discussion
Although several prognostic scores have been reported to be associated with prognosis in PBC patients11, it 
was unclear whether these markers reflect prognosis in both the short and long term. Therefore, we compared 
these well-established predictive markers, including the ALBI score, using time-dependent ROC curves in PBC 
patients. In our cohort, although more than 70% of deaths in patients with PBC were due to liver-related disease, 
time-dependent ROC analysis showed that the ALBI score and Mayo score had higher AUROCs than the other 
markers for predicting overall survival and the incidence of liver transplantation.
ROC analysis is commonly used to evaluate the discriminatory power of a continuous variable for a binary 
disease outcome. However, it is impossible to compare the prognosis determined using general ROC analysis 
because outcomes are time dependent. In addition, the Kaplan–Meier method, which is frequently used to 
investigate prognosis, requires optimal cutoff values for each marker. For instance, there is no established cutoff 
value for the Mayo score, and it is unclear whether the range of FIB-4 index cutoff values from 1.45 to 3.25, 
as determined in a previous study on hepatitis C virus infection12, is applicable to PBC. On the other hand, 
time-dependent ROC curves have been introduced for assessing the predictive power of diagnostic markers 
for time-dependent disease outcomes13,14. This analysis can compare multiple markers at the same time without 
the need to determine cutoff values. This is the first report in which the prognosis of PBC patients was assessed 
using continuous predictive markers and time-dependent ROC analysis.
This study clearly demonstrated that both the ALBI score and Mayo score, assessed at the start of follow-up, 
were strongly associated with outcomes (death or liver transplantation). Clinically, the C–P score/classification is 
commonly used to determine the prognosis of patients with chronic liver diseases or liver cancers9,15,16. However, 
the C–P score is limited by its use of arbitrary parameter cutoff values and by the fact that all five parameters are 
weighted equally, including two subjective parameters: the presence of ascites and the degree of hepatic encepha￾lopathy. By contrast, the ALBI score is calculated using only serum albumin and bilirubin levels, both of which 
are incorporated in the conventional C–P score, and it does not require evaluation of prothrombin time, another 
parameter in the C–P classification system. Recently, the ALBI score/grade has been widely used for predicting 
outcomes, especially in the field of HCC17–19. Regarding the analysis of clinical outcomes in PBC, Fujita et al.

better than that for the C–P classification (708.96 vs. 720.37). ALBI albumin–bilirubin; C–P Child–Pugh; AIC

and Chan et al. reported the utility of the ALBI score as a predictive marker20,21. However, both studies used 
the Kaplan–Meier method and/or Cox-proportional hazard model for outcome analysis, but neither statistical 
technique can adequately analyze both short- and long-term outcomes. Since most prognostic markers for PBC 
incorporate serum bilirubin and albumin levels, multivariate analysis is unsuitable for comparing these markers 
because these levels can be confounding factors. A strength of our study is that it evaluates outcome data using 
time-dependent ROC analysis comparing these studies at the same time points.
On the other hand, almost all prognostic markers used in the present study were selected as significant factors 
for predicting not only liver-related but also non-liver related events by univariate analysis using Fine and Gray 
proportional hazards models. In 15 cases died by non liver-related deaths, more than half patients (n=8) died 
due to non-malignant diseases: acute pneumonia; n=4, gastrointestinal bleeding other than varices bleeding; 
n=3, acute pancreatitis; n=1 (Supplementary Table S2. online). Especially, the incidence of pneumonia and GI 
bleeding were related to the progression of PBC, and prognostic markers for PBC might be able to affect HRs 
for these incidence.
Time-dependent ROC analysis showed that the AUROCs of ALBI score were higher than those of the Mayo 
score within 2 years after the start of observation. Conversely, the Mayo score had a high AUROC throughout 
the follow-up period. The Mayo score is one of the most widely accepted non-invasive markers for estimating the 
prognosis of patients with PBC8,22. The high, stable AUROC of the Mayo score indicated its efficacy in predicting 
both short- and long-term outcomes. However, one of its drawbacks is that like the C–P score, its calculation 
requires the presence of edema, a subjective parameter. Therefore, the ALBI score/grade has advantages in terms 
of simplicity and objectivity. Interestingly, the AUROC of the FIB-4 index, a non-invasive fibrosis marker used 
widely in clinical settings, was the lowest of all the markers, although it gradually increased over time. To reveal 
which factors in the component of FIB-4 index can be responsible for this change, we performed time-dependent 
ROC analysis using each single marker (Supplementary Fig. S4. online). The FIB-4 index is calculated with age, 
AST, ALT, and platelet counts, but this analysis revealed the age factor showed similar changes of the AUROCs 
in FIB-4 index, indicating that this shift seems to be strongly influenced by age factor. These results indicate that 
the FIB-4 index is not ideal for predicting prognosis in a short term. On the other hand, the AUROCs of total 
bilirubin were the highest, and those of albumin were lowest among these single markers. Therefore, the high 
AUROCs in ALBI score can be mainly affected by the bilirubin factor. However, the ALBI score that calculated 
by bilirubin and albumin showed higher AUROCs than bilirubin alone, suggesting that it could be used as a 
better prognostic marker by combining them. Previous reports showed that non-invasive fibrosis markers are 
essential for estimating outcomes in PBC23,24. The ALBI and Mayo scores, which include bilirubin, are superior 
to the FIB-4 index for predicting outcomes, including mortality and liver transplant-free survival, throughout 
the clinical course of patients with PBC.
This study has several limitations. First, this was a retrospective, hospital-based cohort study, which increases 
the risk of selection bias. We included patients with PBC from three clinical hospitals, but liver transplantation 
was performed only in Nagoya University Hospital. Since accessibility to liver transplantation was limited in 
the other two participated hospitals, there was a concern for analyzing outcomes. However, the ALBI score/
grade showed identical prognostic results between these hospitals (data not shown) implying the accessibility 
did not affect the prognosis in PBC patients in our clinical settings. Second, although recent studies focusing 
on transplant-free survival after 1 year of UDCA therapy demonstrated the utility of two additional prognostic 
scores, the GLOBE score and UK-PBC score25,26, we were unable to assess prognosis using these scores. In this 
study, almost all patients (92.3%) underwent treatment with UDCA during follow-up, but we did not assess the 
response to UDCA. Our study included cases with rapid progression of liver dysfunction, and we investigated 
not only long-term but also short-term prognosis, i.e., within 1 year. However, the GLOBE and UK-PBC scores 
require data obtained at least 1 year after the start of UDCA therapy. In addition, 41 patients (10.0%) who have 
already started the UDCA treatment at the start of follow-up. To assess several additional markers, including the 
GLOBE and UK-PBC scores, further studies should recruit additional UDCA naïve patients with observation 
periods over 1 year. Third, histological confirmations of liver fibrosis were obtained in only some patients. In 
addition, in many cases there was a time lag from the start of follow-up to liver biopsy. Therefore, in this study 
we did not assess the correlation between outcome and pathological liver fibrosis. However, the strengths of our 
study included its long-term follow-up period and large number of patients.
In conclusion, our study showed that the ALBI score and Mayo score had high prognostic ability for predicting 
outcomes in PBC patients. An advantage of the ALBI score/grade is that it can be simply calculated by objective 
blood tests without subjective factors or invasive procedures. Therefore, the ALBI score/grade may be useful 
to determine treatment strategies for PBC patients. Conversely, the FIB-4 index has limited ability to predict 
prognosis in the short term. Clinicians following patients with PBC should be familiar with the characteristics 
of each of these predictive markers.
Methods
Patients. Between March 1990 and October 2018, a total of 435 patients were diagnosed with PBC at Nagoya 
University Hospital, Ogaki Municipal Hospital, and Toyota Kosei Hospital. The diagnosis of PBC was based on 
criteria by the Japan Society of Hepatology16, as follows: Patients with one of the following criteria should be 
diagnosed with PBC; (1) histologically confirmed chronic non-suppurative destructive cholangitis (CNSDC) 
with laboratory findings compatible with PBC; (2) positivity for anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMAs) with 
histological findings compatible with PBC but in the absence of characteristic histological findings of CNSDC; 
and (3) no histological findings available, but positivity for AMAs as well as clinical findings and a course indica￾tive of typical cholestatic PBC. The pathological stage of PBC was evaluated by an experienced pathologist who

specialized in liver pathology based on the Scheuer’s classification as follows: stage 1, florid duct lesion; stage 2, 
ductular proliferation; stage 3, scarring; and stage 4, cirrhosis27.
Twenty-six patients were excluded for the following reasons: (1) insufficient follow-up or incomplete data, 
n = 2; (2) PBC-AIH (autoimmune hepatitis) overlap syndrome, n = 15; (3) suspected liver injury induced by 
concomitant nonalcoholic steatohepatitis from hepatic pathology, n=1; (4) concomitant hepatitis B and/or C 
virus infection, n=3; (5) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that did not meet the Milan Criteria28, n=5. Ulti￾mately, 409 patients were enrolled in this retrospective study. We defined probable PBC-AIH overlap syndrome 
based on the combination of immunoglobulin G levels more than twice the upper limit of normal (ULN) and 
aminotransferase levels more than five times the ULN29. If we suspected overlap syndrome, the final diagnosis 
was performed based on pathological findings on liver biopsy30. Additionally, we excluded the patients who could 
improve their liver-related laboratory data by the administration of corticosteroids during the follow-up period 
as PBC-AIH overlap syndrome. In this study, for assessing liver transplantation-free survival in patients who met 
the Milan Criteria, we included patients with HCC who met the Milan Criteria at the time of diagnosis of PBC, 
as well as those with a history of complete cure of HCC. Regular surveillance was performed every 3–6 months 
using ultrasonography and/or blood tests, and included measurement of the tumor marker alpha-fetoprotein. 
Decisions regarding the treatment of each patient were based on Japanese treatment guidelines for PBC16. The 
study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of Nagoya University Hospital (No. 2019-0055) and 
was in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration. Informed consent in the present study was obtained in the form 
of opt-out on the website of Nagoya University Hospital, Ogaki Municipal Hospital, and Toyota Kosei Hospital.
Calculation of prognostic parameters. The formulas of the MELD score, Mayo risk score for PBC, 
Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index, and ALBI score/grade were as follows:
• MELD score=(0.957 * ln(serum creatinine)+0.378 * ln(serum bilirubin)+1.120 * ln(INR)+0.643) * 10; if 
on hemodialysis: calculate as creatinine 4.0 mg/d5
.
• Mayo risk score = 0.051(age) + 1.209 log(bilirubin) − 3.304 log(albumin) + 2.754 log(prothrombin time 
sec)+0.675(edema); edema: 0=no edema without diuretics, 0.5=edema without diuretic therapy or edema 
resolved with diuretic therapy, 1=edema despite diuretic therapy8
.
• FIB-4 index=aspartate aminotransferase (AST) [IU/L] * age [years]/platelet count [109
/L] * alanine ami￾notransferase (ALT) [IU/L]1/212.
• ALBI score/grade={log10 bilirubin (μmol/L) * 0.66}+{albumin (g/L) *−0.085}. Grade 1 liver function cor￾responds to an ALBI score≤  −2.60, grade 2 corresponds to an ALBI score from −2.60 to−1.39, and grade 3 
corresponds to an ALBI score>  −1.3910.
In this study, we used the modified C–P score for PBC based on a previous report16. These prognostic markers 
were calculated at the start of follow-up at each institution and used for analysis of the prognosis in the present 
study.
Statistical analysis. Continuous variables are expressed as mean±SD (standard deviation). Categorical 
variables are expressed as number (percentage). Actuarial analysis of cumulative survival was performed using 
the Kaplan–Meier method based on C–P and ALBI grades, and differences were tested using the log-rank test. 
Discriminatory abilities of the scoring models were assessed using Akaike’s information criterion (AIC). Fine￾Grey proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) for overall disease-related and liver 
transplantation-related mortality. Statistical significance was defined as P<0.05. Statistical analyses other than 
time-dependent ROC were performed with EZR (Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, 
Japan), a graphical user interface for R (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria)31. More 
precisely, it is a modified version of the R commander designed to add statistical functions frequently used 
in biostatistics. We used the “survivalROC” package, written for R, to assess marker performance using time￾dependent ROC curves.
