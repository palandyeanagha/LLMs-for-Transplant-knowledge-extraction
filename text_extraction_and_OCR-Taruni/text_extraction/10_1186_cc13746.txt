Abstract
Introduction: Critical illness is a well-recognized cause of neuromuscular weakness and impaired physical functioning.
Physical therapy (PT) has been demonstrated to be safe and effective for critically ill patients. The impact of such an
intervention on patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has not been well characterized.
We describe the feasibility and impact of active PT on ECMO patients.
Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 100 consecutive patients receiving ECMO in the medical
intensive care unit of a university hospital.
Results: Of the 100 patients receiving ECMO, 35 (35%) participated in active PT; 19 as bridge to transplant and 16 as
bridge to recovery. Duration of ECMO was 14.3 ± 10.9 days. Patients received 7.2 ± 6.5 PT sessions while on ECMO.
During PT sessions, 18 patients (51%) ambulated (median distance 175 feet, range 4 to 2,800) and 9 patients were on
vasopressors. Whilst receiving ECMO, 23 patients were liberated from invasive mechanical ventilation. Of the 16 bridge
to recovery patients, 14 (88%) survived to discharge; 10 bridge to transplant patients (53%) survived to transplantation,
with 9 (90%) surviving to discharge. Of the 23 survivors, 13 (57%) went directly home, 8 (35%) went to acute
rehabilitation, and 2 (9%) went to subacute rehabilitation. There were no PT-related complications.
Conclusions: Active PT, including ambulation, can be achieved safely and reliably in ECMO patients when an
experienced, multidisciplinary team is utilized. More research is needed to define the barriers to PT and the impact on
survival and long-term functional, neurocognitive outcomes in this population.
Introduction
Neuromuscular weakness and the accompanying impair￾ment in physical functioning are common sequelae of
immobilization during critical illness [1-5]. Active partici￾pation in physical and occupational therapy is increasingly
recognized as not only safe and feasible, but also the pre￾ferred approach to minimize debilitation in critically ill
patients, including those who require invasive mechanical
ventilation [6-8]. Patients who receive early rehabilitation
have shown improved rates of returning to independent
functioning, decreased rates of delirium, and shorter
durations of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit
length of stay, and hospital length of stay [9-11].
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is in￾creasingly being used in patients with respiratory failure
[12,13]. Patients receiving venovenous or venoarterial
ECMO have traditionally been considered too unstable
for active physical therapy, frequently are heavily sedated,
and occasionally are administered neuromuscular blocking
agents. However, the ability to ambulate while receiving
ECMO support has been facilitated by advances in extra￾corporeal technology and cannulation techniques [14-17].
Additionally, mobilization may be facilitated when ECMO
allows for weaning from invasive mechanical ventilation
[18]. Although patients receiving ECMO as bridge to
transplantation (BTT) are obvious targets for early re￾habilitation to maintain their transplant candidacy, those
requiring ECMO as a bridge to recovery (BTR) from acute

respiratory failure should theoretically benefit similarly
from early mobilization, though there are few published
reports of success in such populations [18-21]. We de￾scribe our center’s experience with a multidisciplinary ap￾proach to early physical therapy, including ambulation, in
patients requiring ECMO as either BTR from acute re￾spiratory failure or BTT in cases of end-stage lung disease.
Material and methods
Data collection
A retrospective analysis was performed on 100 consecu￾tive patients receiving ECMO for refractory respiratory
or cardiac failure in the Medical Intensive Care Unit
(MICU) at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia
University College of Physicians and Surgeons starting
in April 2009 – the period after which our ECMO mobi￾lization program began. These patients, a subset of all
patients receiving ECMO at our institution, are managed
by a multidisciplinary team who adhere to standardized
management guidelines for anticoagulation, ventilation,
sedation and physical therapy specific to the MICU ECMO
population. They do not typically include immediate
postoperative patients who have undergone lung or
heart transplantation or other cardiothoracic surgeries,
the majority of whom are managed separately in the
cardiothoracic ICU. Baseline demographic data were
collected on all patients, including age, Acute Physiology
and Chronic Health Evaluation II score at time of admis￾sion to the MICU, diagnosis, the goal of ECMO therapy
(BTT or BTR), tracheostomy status and ECMO configur￾ation. Ventilatory status, oxygenation and ECMO settings
were recorded before, during and after all physical therapy
sessions.
BTT patients may, in general, be expected to have
lower severity of illness scores than BTR patients be￾cause the more critically ill potential BTT patients
would be less suitable for transplantation and, therefore,
not receive ECMO as BTT. Likewise, BTT patients may
receive ECMO support for a longer duration than BTR
patients, depending on the availability of transplantable
organs, which in turn could provide more opportunities
for physical therapy. For these reasons, BTT and BTR
patients were analyzed separately.
To record the highest level of mobilization achieved
by patients receiving ECMO, the following ordinal scale
was used: (1) no mobilization or passive range of motion
of extremities, (2) turning in bed (including active-assisted
range of motion of extremities), (3) sitting in bed with the
head of bed elevated, (4) sitting on the edge of the bed
with feet on floor, (5) out of bed sitting in a chair, (6)
standing out of bed, (7) marching in place, and (8) ambu￾lating (Table 1). This mobilization scale was adapted from
an early version of a validated ICU Mobility Scale [22].
Outcomes include survival to transplant or discharge,
discharge disposition among survivors (home, acute re￾habilitation, subacute rehabilitation), and critical safety
events that occurred during the course of physical therapy
treatment sessions, including patient-related complica￾tions (hemodynamic instability, sustained desaturation
to <85%, cardiac arrest, arrhythmia, bleeding at catheter
site, new limb ischemia, non-ECMO catheter dislodge￾ment) and circuit-related complications (oxygenator failure,
pump failure, cannula dislodgement, tubing rupture, inter￾ruptions in blood flow).
Statistical analysis
We summarized data using means with standard devia￾tions, medians and ranges, or proportions. The chi-square
test was used to determine statistical difference between
categorical variables. All statistical analyses were perfor￾med with Microsoft Excel, version 14.3.2.
Multidisciplinary approach to physical therapy and early
mobilization
All ECMO recipients are evaluated daily from Monday
through Saturday for their suitability for participation in
physical and occupational therapy, which includes assess￾ments by physical and occupational therapists, nurses,
nurse practitioners, respiratory therapists and intensive
care physicians. Reasons for deferring therapy, assessed on
an individual basis and at the discretion of the treatment
team, include clinically significant hemorrhage, unstable
arrhythmia, severe thrombocytopenia, hemodynamic in￾stability requiring high-dose vasopressors, severe hypox￾emia despite oxygen supplementation, sedation precluding
active participation by the patient and use of neuromuscu￾lar blockade. The mobilization team consists of a physical
therapist, a perfusionist and a critical care registered nurse,
with or without a critical care nurse practitioner, a respira￾tory therapist or an ECMO intensivist or surgeon, depend￾ing on the functional needs and clinical stability of the
patient. The minimum number of participating clinicians

is three. We use a simplified ECMO circuit that includes
only the core components (centrifugal pump, membrane
oxygenator, console and tubing). All other intravenous ther￾apies, including hemodialysis, are administered through
separate access points. Nonessential therapies are tem￾porarily discontinued during physical therapy sessions
(Figure 1). Particular attention is paid to the integrity of
the ECMO cannula and tubing. A stabilization device,
consisting of thermoplastic splinting material, may be
used to secure the ECMO cannula and tubing during
mobilization (An additional image file demonstrates the
use of this device in more detail [see Additional file 1]).
The ECMO circuit, consisting of a centrifugal pump, poly￾methylpentene oxygenator and console, is kept on a
sprinter cart that can be mobilized alongside the ambula￾tory patient. During physical therapy sessions, support for
gas exchange, in the form of ECMO sweep gas flow rates,
ECMO blood flow rates and supplemental oxygen, may
all be increased as needed, based on clinician judgment.
Hemodynamic and respiratory statuses are monitored
throughout, including the use of continuous pulse oxim￾etry. Physical therapy sessions may be interrupted or
terminated, based on the judgment of the participating cli￾nicians, for changes that include hemodynamic instability,
hypoxemia, dizziness, weakness, chest pain or dyspnea.
This study was conducted in accordance with the
amended Declaration of Helsinki. The Columbia Univer￾sity Institutional Review Board approved the study (IRB
Committee: Exp; Approval # IRB-AAAF3940). All necessary
consents for patients involved in the study were obtained.
Results
Baseline demographics
Among 100 consecutive patients managed with ECMO
for refractory respiratory or cardiac failure in the MICU
starting in April 2009, 26 patients received ECMO with
the intention of BTT, and 74 patients received ECMO as
BTR. Thirty-five of the 100 patients participated in
active physical therapy while receiving ECMO support
(Table 2). Six BTT patients (32%) and 12 BTR patients
(75%) had primarily hypoxemic respiratory failure. Seven
BTT patients (37%) and four BTR patients (25%) had
primarily hypercapnic respiratory failure. Five BTT pa￾tients (26%) had combined hypoxemic and hypercapnic

respiratory failure. Pre-ECMO arterial blood gas analyses
demonstrated marked impairment in gas exchange (Table 2).
A high severity of illness was also evident in the mean Acute
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II
score of 24.3 ± 7.8 in the total cohort of patients partici￾pating in active physical therapy, with a particularly high
APACHE II score, 28.8 ± 7.8, in the BTR subset.
ECMO support
The mean ECMO blood flow rates and sweep gas flow
rates both before and during physical therapy sessions
are detailed in Table 3. The fraction of oxygen delivered
through the ECMO circuit was maintained at 1.0 for all
patients until they were ready to wean from ECMO.
Invasive mechanical ventilation status and supplemental
oxygen requirements
Two-thirds of participants in physical therapy were
liberated from invasive mechanical ventilation while re￾ceiving ECMO, with similar frequency in both BTT and
BTR groups (Table 3). Three patients were weaned to no
oxygen support, seventeen patients were supported with

conventional nasal cannula, and three patients were sup￾ported with high flow nasal cannula. From their first
through last physical therapy sessions while receiving
ECMO, three patients had an overall decrease in the
amount of conventional ventilatory support, three pa￾tients required more support, and the remaining 29 pa￾tients had no change in the amount of support needed.
For individual physical therapy sessions, there were no dif￾ferences between the amount of support needed before
and during therapy. Approximately one-third of patients
received a tracheostomy while receiving ECMO, with a
higher percentage of BTT patients undergoing tracheos￾tomy than BTR patients.
Physical therapy
The median maximum physical therapy score achieved
was 8 (interquartile range (IQR) 2 to 8) in the entire
cohort, with a median of 8 in the BTT group and a median
of 2 in the BTR group (Table 4). The maximal level of
activity achieved was bed-level active-assisted range of
motion in eleven patients (32%), sitting in bed in two
patients (6%), sitting at the edge of the bed in one patient
(3%), standing in three patients (9%), and ambulating in
eighteen patients (51%). The median number of physical
therapy sessions per patient was five, with a median of 2.8
sessions per patient per week. Among the eighteen pa￾tients who achieved ambulation, the median distance
walked was 175 feet (IQR 37.5 to 285), with one BTT pa￾tient able to use an in-bed restorator bicycle for 4 minutes,
a second patient able to ambulate 1,600 feet and use a
bedside stationary bicycle for 25 minutes, and another
patient able to ambulate unassisted up to 2,800 feet daily.
One patient with a femoral venous ECMO catheter was
able to stand with minimal assistance, and a second
patient with a femoral venous ECMO catheter was able to
ambulate 4 feet. Thirteen patients improved their physical
therapy score over the course of their time on ECMO,
nineteen patients maintained the same level of activ￾ity, and three patients had a decline in their physical
therapy score.
Compared with ECMO settings before physical ther￾apy, there was no overall difference in mean ECMO
blood flow rates or sweep gas flow rates before, during,
or after all physical therapy sessions (Table 3). One
patient who ambulated 1,600 feet and used the cycle
ergometer had his ECMO blood flow rate consistently
increased by 0.5 LPM for all physical therapy sessions
without adjustment of sweep gas flow rates. Eight pa￾tients (24%) required an increase in the amount of
supplemental oxygen during physical therapy to maintain
adequate oxygenation, seven of whom were ambulatory.
Twenty-six percent of patients were receiving vaso￾pressors at the time of physical therapy (Table 3). No ad￾justments were made to vasopressor doses during
physical therapy.
Outcomes
The mean duration of ECMO in the BTT patients who
participated in active physical therapy was 18.7 ± 13.2 days.
Ten of the BTT patients (53%) survived to lung trans￾plantation, with a mean duration of ECMO of 13.8 ±
7.8 days prior to transplant. Nine of those patients remain
alive post-transplant at the time of this report, with one
patient having died 29 days post-transplant from multi￾organ failure. All but one of the transplant survivors were
discharged directly to home or admitted to acute rehabili￾tation facilities prior to discharge to home (Table 4). For
those patients who survived to discharge, the mean hos￾pital length of stay post-transplant was 33.6 ± 10.9 days.
The mean duration of ECMO in the BTR group was
9.1 ± 2.6 days, with 88% surviving to decannulation and
subsequent discharge. All but one of the BTR survivors

were discharged directly to home or admitted to acute
rehabilitation facilities prior to discharge to home. The
mean hospital length of stay post-ECMO decannulation
was 17.9 ± 17.2 days.
Trends in participation in physical therapy
Compared with the rate of participation in active phys￾ical therapy among MICU ECMO patients from 2009 to
2010, there has been a significantly higher percentage of
patients participating in active physical therapy since
2011 (17% versus 41%, P <0.001) (Figure 2).
Complications
There were no patient-related or circuit-related compli￾cations as a result of physical therapy treatment sessions
in any of the patients.
Discussion
There is increasing evidence demonstrating improved
outcomes from early rehabilitation, including ambula￾tion, in critically ill patients [1,7-10]. With the increasing
use of ECMO for patients with either acute, potentially
reversible, respiratory failure or end-stage lung disease
awaiting transplantation, there is a growing need to evalu￾ate the feasibility, safety, and functional outcomes of per￾forming physical rehabilitation and early mobilization
within this patient population.
Previously published case series describing attempts at
active physical therapy and mobilization in patients receiv￾ing ECMO have reported small cohorts with varying de￾grees of success, and these were mostly pre-transplant
patients [18-21,23-27]. In order to maximize the success of
physical therapy and minimize the risk of complications,
we have developed a multidisciplinary team approach to
physical therapy for patients receiving ECMO.
Older generations of extracorporeal technology were
cumbersome and difficult to mobilize. Additionally, trad￾itional ECMO configurations involved femoral cannulation,
making mobilization, especially ambulation, a high-risk in￾tervention because ECMO catheters are larger and less
flexible than other catheters typically used in medical
intensive care [28] and dislodgment has more severe con￾sequences. Despite these concerns, we were successful in
achieving standing or ambulation in two patients with
femoral venous ECMO cannulae, demonstrating feasibil￾ity. The risks associated with mobilization while receiving
ECMO have been lessened by the concurrent develop￾ment of more compact circuitry and dual-lumen catheters
that can provide venovenous extracorporeal support via
an upper-body approach [14,15,29]; however, these dual￾lumen cannulae require particular expertise for proper
placement and are associated with complications unique
to this approach [30]. Additionally, the combination of
internal jugular venous and subclavian arterial cannulation
permits venoarterial ECMO support via an upper-body
configuration [17]. Our experience suggests that while
femoral cannulation is not an absolute contraindica￾tion to ambulation, it is certainly not optimal, and an
upper-body configuration is our recommended approach
to facilitate ambulation and avoid cannula complications
during mobilization.
With increases in extracorporeal gas exchange effi￾ciency, select patients are eligible for endotracheal extu￾bation while receiving ECMO. Extubation eliminates the
accumulation of complications associated with invasive
mechanical ventilation (ventilator-associated pneumonia,
ventilator-associated lung injury, dynamic hyperinflation,
impaired delivery of aerosolized medications), reduces
the need for sedatives commonly employed to maximize
patient-ventilator synchrony, improves patient comfort,
and further facilitates ambulation by having one less
apparatus to mobilize, all of which may contribute to im￾proved outcomes [31-35]. We were successful in liberating
66% of the ECMO patients receiving active physical
therapy from invasive mechanical ventilation, with similar
rates in both BTT and BTR groups. Liberation from inva￾sive mechanical ventilation occurred in parallel with the
physical therapy program.
Our ability to safely and repeatedly mobilize patients
being bridged to either transplant or recovery was demon￾strated despite a high severity of illness, as evidenced by
very severe pre-ECMO gas exchange abnormalities and
high APACHE II scores. These scores may underestimate
the true severity of illness in patients transferred from out￾side institutions due to missing data representing the most
severe physiologic derangements prior to the initiation of
ECMO. Patients were able to engage in active physical
therapy despite the need for low-dose vasopressors, and
no significant changes in ECMO settings were needed

during activity with the exception of one patient who en￾gaged in cycling. Physical therapy sessions and ambulation
were more frequent in the BTT group, which may be
explained, in part, by the longer duration of ECMO (18.7
versus 9.1 days), lower average APACHE II score (20.4
versus 28.8), lower percentage of patients with hypoxemic
respiratory failure (58% versus 75%) and, to a much lesser
extent, less severe hypoxemia (PaO2:FIO2 of 62 versus 55)
in the BTT group than the BTR group. As expected, BTT
patients had lower severity of illness scores than BTR
patients, in part because those who are too critically ill
may be unsuitable for transplantation and, therefore, not
considered candidates for ECMO as BTT.
Despite the advances in extracorporeal technology, not
all ECMO patients may be appropriate candidates for
early rehabilitation. Overall, approximately one third of
our total ECMO cohort was able to participate actively
in physical therapy, although our rate of participation
has increased by more than 240% from 2009 to the
present, with more than 40% of recent ECMO patients
participating in active physical therapy. The increased
rate is due, in part, to increased experience and comfort
with mobilizing critically ill patients in general, which
was aided by the initiation of a global early mobilization
program in our MICU.
Over the course of the study period, we relaxed our
criteria for participation in rehabilitation, in parallel with
increasing comfort by our staff in treating patients with
marked physiologic derangements. Patients on low-dose
vasopressors or requiring high ventilatory support who,
early in our experience, were deemed too unstable for
mobilization are now more routinely engaged in physical
therapy. However, there are clinical parameters that may
limit physical therapy. Patients who are hemodynamically
unstable requiring high-dose vasopressor support are not
engaged in physical therapy. Additionally, those who are
deeply sedated, receiving neuromuscular blockade, or se￾verely hypoxemic despite extracorporeal support remain a
population that is unsuitable for our mobilization proto￾col, and accounted for the vast majority of patients who
did not participate in active physical therapy in our cohort.
However, compared with the earlier study period, our
approach to critically ill patients in general, and ECMO
patients specifically, has evolved to incorporate less
sedation and neuromuscular blockade, allowing more
patients to remain awake during their MICU stay, accoun￾ting for the significant difference in patients participating
in active physical therapy. Because the more critically ill
patients, with a higher expected mortality, were the ones
unable to participate in mobilization, comparison of out￾comes between those who did and did not receive active
physical therapy would not reflect just the impact of our
protocol on those outcomes. Larger, prospective studies
are needed to better define the barriers to physical therapy
and mobilization in ECMO patients and to understand
the effect of these interventions on functional outcomes.
Future studies may also help establish protocols regarding
adjustments to ECMO settings as necessary to compen￾sate for increases in activity that can be standardized and
applied across different ECMO patient populations. Cost￾benefit analyses are also warranted given the cost associ￾ated with increased staffing needs for early mobilization
protocols. Although occupational therapy statistics are not
represented in this study, it would be beneficial for
future studies to examine the impact of occupational
therapy on the ECMO population. Occupational ther￾apists are now participating in the early mobilization
of these patients with a focus on activities of daily living,
upper extremity strengthening and coordination, cogni￾tion and communication.
Conclusions
Active physical therapy, including early mobilization, may
be performed in patients receiving ECMO. Advances in
technology and a multidisciplinary team approach facili￾tate the safe and reliable implementation of such an inter￾vention, even among patients with a very high severity of
illness. Additional research is needed to characterize the
long-term functional, neurocognitive and psychiatric im￾pact of physical and occupational therapy on patients
receiving ECMO.
Key messages
 Active physical therapy is safe and feasible for
patients receiving ECMO.
 A multidisciplinary team approach facilitates the
implementation of a rehabilitation program for
ECMO recipients.
 Both patients awaiting transplantation and those
being bridged to recovery may benefit from active
physical therapy, although the optimal patient
population remains to be defined.
 Future studies are needed to better define barriers to
physical therapy in ECMO recipients and whether
such interventions have a favorable impact on major
clinical outcomes and are cost effective.
