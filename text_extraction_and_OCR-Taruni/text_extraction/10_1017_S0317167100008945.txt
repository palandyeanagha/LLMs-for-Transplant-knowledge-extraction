Advances in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS)
offers patients hope in reducing the potentially devastating
effects of stroke. The major change in stroke care in the past
decade has been the use of thrombolytic agents. Only two
thrombolytics, intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen
activator (rt-PA) and intraarterial pro-urokinase, have been
proven effective in randomized double-blinded placebo trials.
1,2
For clinicians, one major barrier to early treatment is the
delay in accessing the prothrombin time, particularly evident
when patients present with aphasia or are currently receiving
warfarin therapy. Use of warfarin is increasing with the aging
population due to the increase of atrial fibrillation. Many patients
on warfarin therapy for atrial fibrillation who present to hospital
with acute ischemic stroke present with sub-therapeutic INR
ABSTRACT: Background: In the emergency department, portable point-of-care testing (POCT) coagulation devices may facilitate
stroke patient care by providing rapid International Normalized Ratio (INR) measurement. The objective of this study was to evaluate
the reliability, validity, and impact on clinical decision-making of a POCT device for INR testing in the setting of acute ischemic stroke
(AIS). Methods: A total of 150 patients (50 healthy volunteers, 51 anticoagulated patients, 49 AIS patients) were assessed in a tertiary
care facility. The INR’s were measured using the Roche Coaguchek S and the standard laboratory technique. Results: The interclass
correlation coefficient and 95% confidence interval between overall POCT device and standard laboratory value INRs was high (0.932
(0.69 – 0.78). In the AIS group alone, the correlation coefficient and 95% CI was also high 0.937 (0.59 – 0.74) and diagnostic accuracy
of the POCT device was 94%. Conclusions: When used by a trained health professional in the emergency department to assess INR
in acute ischemic stroke patients, the CoaguChek S is reliable and provides rapid results. However, as concordance with laboratory INR
values decreases with higher INR values, it is recommended that with CoaguChek S INRs in the > 1.5 range, a standard laboratory
measurement be used to confirm the results.
RÉSUMÉ: Fiabilité de l’INR effectué au point d’intervention dans l’accident vasculaire cérébral aigu. Contexte : À la salle d’urgence, les
appareils portatifs pour analyse de l’INR au point d’intervention (API) peuvent faciliter les soins prodigués aux patients atteints d’accidents vasculaires
cérébraux (AVC). Le but de cette étude était d’évaluer la fiabilité, la validité et l’impact sur la décision clinique de l’INR effectué au moyen d’un
appareil d’API dans le contexte de l’AVC aigu. Méthodes : Cent cinquante patients, soit 50 volontaires sains, 51 patients anticoagulés et 49 patients
atteints d’un AVC aigu, ont été évalués dans un centre de soins tertiaires. Le Roche Coaguchek S et la technique standard de laboratoire ont été utilisés
pour mesurer l’INR. Résultats : Globalement, le coefficient de corrélation interclasse et l’intervalle de confiance à 95% entre la valeur de l’INR
mesurée par l’appareil d’API et la valeur mesurée par la technique standard de laboratoire était élevée (CC0,932; IC95% 0,69 à 0,78). Dans le groupe
de patients présentant un d’AVC aigu, le coefficient de corrélation était également élevé (0,937; IC95% 0,59 à 0,74) et la précision diagnostique de
l’appareil d’API était 94%. Conclusions : Quand le CoaguChek S est utilisé à la salle d’urgence par un professionnel de la santé entraîné pour mesurer
l’INR chez des patients atteints d’un AVC ischémique aigu, l’appareil est fiable et rapide. Cependant, étant donné que la concordance entre les valeurs
d’INR obtenues au moyen de l’appareil et par la technique standard diminue lorsque les valeurs d’INR sont plus élevées, il est recommandé d’obtenir
confirmation des résultats par la méthode standard quand la valeur obtenue par CoaguChek S est > 1,5.

thrombolytic treatment for these acute stroke patients. The
purpose of this study therefore, was to evaluate the reliability and
potential benefits of point-of-care testing (POCT) of INR in the
acute stroke patient population.
Point-of care testing, if shown to be reliable in this
population, has the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality
by improving the door to needle time for thrombolytic treatment.
Point-of-care testing uses whole capillary blood to measure
prothrombin time and INR with results typically obtained in less
than five minutes.
4 These portable machines were primarily
developed for patient self-testing and rural community testing,
and have also been used during anaesthesia and dental
procedures.
5-9 In the majority of published studies, the POCT
systems are judged almost as reliable as the INR results from
community hospital labs, with INR < 3 or 4 (Mean Relative
Deviation < 10%).
10,11 Results obtained using the Roche
CoaguChek S System, the portable machine used in this
protocol, has shown a significant correlation with laboratory
results if the INR is < 3 or 4.
12,13 Researchers also revealed a
mean difference of 0.09 INR units with INR < 2 and 0.19 units
with INR < 3 in a study utilizing the CoaguChek S predecessor,
the Roche CoaguChek.
14 The limitations of the system seem
totally acceptable in acute stroke therapy where the main values
of interest lie under INR of 2 and the current Canadian standard
of care for acute ischemic stroke contraindicates thrombolysis in
patients with an INR of > 1.4 (note: current US guidelines
suggest an INR of 1.7).
15,16
The primary aim of this study was to confirm the acceptable
reliability of the Roche Coaguchek S System in discriminating
between an INR of less than or greater than 1.5, (value arbitrarily
chosen to accommodate current US and Canadian standards for
tPA administration) as compared to laboratory values, in non￾anticoagulated patients and anticoagulated patients. Good
reliability was defined as a difference in the INR of less than 0.2
between laboratory and device values. A secondary aim was to
evaluate the potential use of INR point-of-care testing in acute
stroke patients in decreasing the time to thrombolytic treatment.
METHODS
A two-phased, prospective cohort study was conducted at the
Foothills Medical Centre in Calgary, Alberta. A convenience
sample of 150 participants was entered into the study. Phase one,
in which the accuracy of the Coaguchek S POCT device as
compared to laboratory-based INR values was assessed, included
one group of 51 healthy volunteers and a second group of 48
anticoagulated inpatients. Phase two of the study was to assess
the reliability and utility of the POCT device in an acute stroke
setting and included 51 consecutive AIS patients assessed in the
emergency department. A single POCT device was used
throughout the study, manufacturer’s and laboratory services
quality assurance procedures were scrupulously followed,
laboratory testing followed within ten minutes of the POCT
finger stick, and study nurses obtaining the POCT sample were
trained in the use of the device.
Ethical approval for the study was received from the Calgary
Conjoint Ethics Review Board and informed consent was
obtained from all Phase I participants prior to any data or sample
collection. Waiver of consent, based on the Canadian Tri-council
Guidelines on Human Subjects Research, was obtained for Phase
II participants.
Healthy volunteers included nursing staff, students, trainees,
and medical personnel in the Department of Clinical
Neurosciences stroke program. Patient participants in phase one
were approached on the stroke unit or the anticoagulation clinic
at the Foothills Medical Centre. Venous and POCT specimens
were collected within minutes of each other. Older patients on
warfarin for cardiac conditions, post-MI patients on warfarin,
patients’ anti-coagulated for venous thromboembolic disease,
and those with liver disease were tested. The accuracy of the
POCT INR device, defined as the extent of comparability of the
POCT results with standard laboratory results, and the difference
of time to results were compared. Basic demographic
information from phase one participants, specifically sex, age,
disease and warfarin use, were collected.
The reliability and utility of the CoaguChek S System in acute
stroke situations was examined in phase two of the study.
Portable INR POCT and standard laboratory values were
evaluated in 51 consecutive AIS patients seen by the stroke team
in the emergency department. One patient in phase two was
excluded from the final analysis as laboratory INR values were
unavailable. Participants recruited for this phase included AIS
patients presenting less than six hours from symptom onset, with
a POCT INR specimen obtained via finger poke collected within
ten minutes of the venous blood specimen draw. Demographic
information included sex, age, stroke type, use of anticoagulants,
and time from symptom onset.
Statistical Methods
Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the
Social Sciences (SPSS) (Version 15, SPSS Corporation,
Chicago, IL). Data are shown using standard descriptive
statistics. Continuous variables were compared using the t-test
for normally distributed data. Categorical variables were
compared using chi-square and Fisher’s exact test, as
appropriate. The INR results were dichotomized to ≤ 1.5 or >
1.5. Linear regression was used to analyse the relationship
between POCT and laboratory INR results.
RESULTS
Demographic data of the entire sample are described in the
Table. The overall sample was predominantly Caucasian (82.4%)
with a median age of 72.0 years (range of 22 – 94 years). There
was a statistically significant difference between the three groups
in terms of age. The volunteer group was significantly younger
than both patient groups (χ2 = 76.52, p<0.0001). The mean time
to POCT INR results was < 1 minute for all three cohorts. There
were significant differences in the mean time to laboratory INR
results between the three groups (χ² 78.46, p = 0.000). The mean
times to obtain laboratory INR results were 129.10 (SD 40.31)
minutes for the healthy volunteer group, 65.95 (SD 49.76)
minutes for the anticoagulation cohort, and 55.82 minutes (SD
20.84) for the acute ischemic stroke cohort.
Pearson product-moment correlations were conducted to
compare POCT and laboratory INR values for each group and
significant correlations were found: volunteers (r=0.371, p =
0.007); anticoagulated patients (r=0.868, p = 0.000); AIS patients
(r=0.873. p=0.000). The interclass correlation coefficient (95%
CI) between the overall sample POCT Coaguchek S and
laboratory values was equal to 0.932 (.69 - .78).

Paired t-tests were conducted to compare differences between
POCT and laboratory INR values in each study group. No
significant differences were found in the volunteer group
[t=0.324 (49), p=0.748], anticoagulated patient group [t=0.477
(50), p=0.636], or the acute ischemic stroke group [t=1.872 (47),
p=0.067]. Linear regression analysis of overall study data
revealed that the POCT device tended to overestimate the true
INR on average by about 1/3rd of an INR unit (LAB INR = 0.733
* POCT INR + 0.347). Linear regression analysis of the AIS
group alone revealed the POCT device also overestimated the
true INR by about 1/3rd of an INR unit (LAB INR=0.666*POCT
INR +0.359). Clinically, this overestimation of the POCT INR
results as compared to laboratory test values was felt to be non￾significant for INR values below 2.0 and for patients with a true
INR<1.5, POCT values were consistent (Figure). In the acute
ischemic stroke group (n=50), the proportion of patients with a
true positive test (LAB and device INR >1.5) was 100% (n=3);
a true negative test (LAB and device INR ≤ 1.4) was 98%
(n=46); a false positive test (LAB INR ≤ 1.4 but device INR >
1.4) was 2% (n=1); and a false negative test (LAB INR ≥ 1.4 and
device INR < 1.4) was 0%.
In assessing the utility of the POCT device in the setting of
AIS, a total of 24 of 50 patients arrived in the emergency
department less than three hours from symptom onset. Twelve of
these 24 patients (24.0%) arrived in less than 90 minutes, while
14 patients (28.0%) arrived under three hours from symptom
onset. The mean time to laboratory INR results in the emergency
department was 55 minutes while POCT results were available in
one-two minutes. Thus for nearly half of the patients in the AIS
group, the delay in obtaining the INR result from the laboratory
factored into the clinician’s ability to determine thrombolytic
treatment options and in 6:14 cases (42.8%), the decision to
initiate thrombolytic therapy was delayed. In terms of ease of use
of the POCT device, there were no cases in which INR could not
be measured.
CONCLUSIONS
In our study, among patients with a true INR < 1.5, the POCT
device results were consistent with laboratory INR values. This
demonstrates that when used by trained health care professionals
in the emergency department, the Roche Coaguchek S produces
reliable results comparable to standard laboratory values. These
results are similar to previously reported results on the validity of
other portable coagulation devices in other settings.
4,5,12,17 In
concordance with results obtained by Lizotte et al (2003),
13 it is
evident that validity of results decreases as INR values increase,
thus confirmation of high POCT INR values should be obtained
using standard laboratory techniques. Similarly, Gosselin et al
(2000) compared INR values obtained from nine different types
of POCT monitors with laboratory INRs and also reported that
although accurate results were obtained by each device (values
within 0.4 units of each other), POCT and laboratory values were
less correlated in higher INR ranges.

Marques (2004) also identified a tendency for POCT devices to
lose comparability with laboratory INR values at higher levels.
19
As the current Canadian standard of care precludes the use of
thrombolytics in the setting of INR values > 1.4, this does not
necessitate a change in practice. The present study therefore,
adds to the body of literature supporting the use of POCT devices
and in particular supports use of these devices as standard
practice in the setting of acute ischemic stroke care. It is
important to note however, that the results of this study are
limited to the use of a POCT device by trained health care
professionals in the acute care setting. The study also tested one
brand of POCT device and similar results may not be
reproducible with other devices.
In the setting of acute ischemic stroke, the decision to initiate
intravenous thrombolytic therapy will often rest on the INR
results; coupled with delays in presentation to the acute care
setting, delays in obtaining an INR result may push the patient
over the three hour window. In our study the mean time to
laboratory INR results in emergency department was 55 minutes.
Given that the majority of AIS patients arrive in the emergency
department >2 hours after symptom onset and must also undergo
diagnostic CT imaging to rule out hemorrhagic stroke, time to
initiate thrombolytic therapy becomes very limited. The use of
the POCT device decreased the time required to obtain a reliable
INR, permitting an earlier treatment with thrombolytic therapy
and possibly a better outcome for the patients. Thus the potential
uses and benefits of POCT for AIS in acute, emergency settings
would be a very viable option to laboratory INR testing.
