Abstract. Cyclosporine belongs to the group of the most 
commonly used immunosuppressants. Hypertension occurs in 
approximately 30% of patients treated with this drug. However, 
the pathogenesis of this occurrence has not been explained to 
date. The purpose of our study was to clarify the mechanisms 
leading to the evolution of hypertension induced by cyclospo￾rine A (CsA). We examined the changes in transmission within 
receptors and around the receptors. We also aimed to elucidate 
the mechanisms responsible for averting arterial hyperrespon￾siveness induced by the drug. Experiments were performed 
on isolated and perfused tail arteries of Wistar rats. Tissues 
surrounding the artery were removed and the proximal segment 
(length of 2-3 cm) was used for cannulation. Cannulated arteries 
were placed in a 20-ml glass chamber (vertical position). The 
contraction force in our model was measured by an increased 
degree of perfusion pressure with a constant flow rate (approxi￾mately 1 ml/min). The results showed that in the presence of 
CsA, the concentration-response curves/phenylephrine (PHE) 
curve shifted to the left. Cyclosporine increased the reactivity 
of the arteries to PHE. This effect was directly linked to the 
increase in the receptor reserve. The analysis of the reactivity 
of vascular smooth muscle showed that CsA increased the 
influx of calcium ions from the extracellular to the intracel￾lular area. No difference was found between the contraction 
triggered by Bay-K8644 in the presence of CsA and the control 
probe. The increase in perfusion pressure induced by CsA was 
blocked by L-type calcium channel blockers (nifidipine and 
diltiazem). The results from our experiments show that CsA 
increases the reactivity of vessels to the effect of catechol￾amines. CsA also enhances signal transmission between 
G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and calcium channels. 
The activation of protein kinase C also plays a significant role 
in this process. Our results suggest that the best choice for the 
pharmacotherapy of hypertension induced by CsA would be 
calcium channel antagonists.
Introduction
Cyclosporine A (CsA) is the most commonly used drug in 
immunosuppressive therapy after kidneys, liver, heart or 
bone marrow transplantation (1). The first polypeptide was 
isolated from the fungus Tolypocladium inflatum. CsA was 
introduced into clinical practice as a new generation of immu￾nosuppresants in the 1980's. It is widely used to prevent the 
rejection of transplanted organs. However, the drug also has 
toxic effects. The spectrum of the usage of CsA is not limited 
only to transplantology; it has also been used to treat patients 
with uveitis - the first effective therapy was documented in 
1979 (2,3). CsA has also been used in other cases where 
conventional treatment has not been effective (4,5).
CsA inhibits the activity of lymphocytes, especially 
Th and Tc, decreasing the production of pro-inflammatory 
interleukin (IL)-2. This effect is based on the binding of CsA 
to the cytosolic protein, cyclophilin of lymphocytes. The 
complex form of CsA and cyclophilin binds to the calcium 
ions, calmodulin and calcineurin (CN). The inhibition of CN 
phosphatase activity, which leads to the dephosphorylation 
of the nuclear factor of activated T lymphocytes (NF-AT), 
prevents its activation. In this case, the promoter for IL-2 is 
blocked (6,7). The application of CsA is associated with many 
side-effects, such as hypertension, renal failure, hepatotoxicity, 
neurological disorders or cancers, which cannot be eliminated

to date (8). One of the main reasons for restricting the usage of 
CsA in certain situations is nephrotoxicity and hypertension 
in approximately 30% of patients. However, the mechanism of 
this action remains unknown (9).
Hypertension caused by immunosuppressants is one of 
the main risk factors of cardiovascular diseases. High blood 
pressure persisting for long periods of time may lead to organ 
complications, atherogenesis, renal failure, heart failure or 
stroke. Decisions regarding the treatment of hypertension 
should be based on clinical investigations that include clas￾sification of hypertension, presence of organ complication, 
additional risk factors (intercurrent diseases) and age (9). Due 
to the similar effectiveness of drugs from five basic groups, 
the European Society of Hypertension, European Society of 
Cardiology and Polish Society of Hypertension do not recom￾mend a specific class of hypertension drugs. The effectiveness 
of treatment depends on the choice of appropriate therapy 
(mono- or polytherapy), drug dose, interactions between drugs 
and the tolerance of drug by the patient (10,11).
Role of calcium ions in vascular smooth muscle tone. The 
contraction of vascular smooth muscle is upregulated by 
membrane G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which 
increase phospholipase C (PLC) activity. Vascular receptors 
which demonstrate pressor effect are as follows: α1, V1, ETA and 
AT1. The complex agonist/receptor leads to Gq protein activa￾tion (first order relay). Through the subunit of Gq protein, PLC 
is activated. PLC catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylino￾sitol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 
(IP3) and diacyloglicerole (DAG) (12,13).
The activation of protein kinase C (PKC) is significant 
in off-receptor signal regulation induced by DAG. There 
are many isolated izoenzymes of PKC which demonstrate 
tissue specificity. PKC enhances the contraction of vascular 
smooth muscle by L-type calcium channel phosporylation. 
The importance of PKC activation is proven by the fact that 
phorbol esters, a group of synthetic PKC activators, induce the 
contraction of vascular smooth muscle (14-18).
Calcium ion homeostasis is upregulated by their passive 
transport to the intracellular space of the myocyte and through 
active transport to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and extra￾cellular area in cooperation with ion exchangers.
Ca2+ ion concentration inside the myocyte is ~10-7 M, 
which contrasts with their high concentration in extracel￾lular fluid (2x10-3 M) (20). The influx of calcium ions from 
the extracellular area goes by channels activated via second 
messanger-operated channel (SMOC), receptor-operated 
channel (ROC), voltage-operated channel (VOC) (types L, 
N and P), Q, R, T and channels dependent on ER (20,21). IP3
receptors (IP3 Rs) activate the influx of Ca2+ ions induced by 
the increase in the concentration of IP3. The second channel 
in the ER area is the ryanodine receptor (RyR). At concen￾trations from 10-9 to 10-6 M/l, ryanodine shows agonistic 
actions, but at concentrations higher than 10-5 M/l, it blocks 
the receptors (22,23).
Calcium signal modulation depends on proteins which func￾tion as the intracellular detectors for these ions. Calmodulin, 
activated by calcium ions, belongs to this group of proteins. 
Complex Ca2+/calmodulin regulates enzyme activity, such as 
phospholipases or kinases (19,24-26).
The aim of the study was to investigate whether calcium 
blockers inhibit CsA-induced hyperactivity of vascular smooth 
muscle cells (VSMCs).
Materials and methods
Animals. Experiments were performed on isolated, perfused 
Wistar rat tail arteries. Animals were housed under a 12/12‑h 
light/dark cycle and had unlimited access to food and water. 
Male rats weighing 250-270 g were narcotized by intraperito￾neal injection of 120 mg urethane per 1 kg of body mass. Rats 
were sacrificed by stunning and cervical dislocation. CsA was 
applied intraperitoneally. The study protocol was approved by 
the local ethics committee. All experiments were carried out 
in accordance with the United States NIH guidelines [Guide 
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (1985), DHEW 
Publication No. (NIH) 8523: Office of Science and Health 
Reports, DRR/NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA].
Drugs and solutions. CsA (1 and 10 nM, or accordingly, 
121.6 and 1,216 ng/ml) dissolved in ethanol solution (70%). 
Krebs solution contained NaCl (71.8 mM/l), KCl (4.7 mM/l), 
CaCl2 (1.7 mM/l), NaHCO3 (28.4 mM/l), MgSO4 (2.4 mM/l), 
KH2PO4 (1.2 mM/l) and glucose (11.1 mM/l). All reagents 
were purchased from the Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Company 
(Poznan, Poland).
Study design and performance. After dissection from 
surrounding tissues, a 2-3 cm long segment of rat tail artery 
was cannulated and connected to a perfusion device. The 
distal part was weighed with a 500-mg weight and the tail 
was placed in a 20-ml container filled with oxygenated Krebs 
solution at 37˚C. The perfusion pressure was continuously 
measured. We gradually increased the perfusion solution 
flow using a peristaltic pump up to 0.25-1 ml/min. Vessel 
contractions induced by phenylephrine (PHE) [an adrenergic 
α-1 receptor, arginine vasopressin (AVP)] and vasopressin 
(non-selective agonist α-1 receptor, V1, V2) were measured as 
an increase in perfusion pressure.
Data analysis and statistical procedures. Perfusion pres￾sure was measured on Nyketron 1675 and TZ-21S devices. 
Concentration response curves (CRCs) were calculated 
according to the method described by van Rossum (27,28). 
Maximal response of tissue (Emax) was calculated as a 
percentage of maximal response of PHE or AVP administered 
in KCl solution. Half maximal effective concentration (EC50) 
was estimated using classical pharmacological methods with 
pD2, the negative logarithm of the EC50. The number of the 
CRC and Emax was used in all calculations estimating the 
statistical significance.
Results
PHE, agonist of the α1 adrenergic receptor, increased the 
perfusion pressure, depending on the concentration. The mean 
perfusate pressure for PHE (10-5 M/l) was 92 (±6.2) mmHg in 
perfusate with Ca2+ and 60 (±4.3) mmHg in perfusate without 
Ca2+. CRCs had sinusoidal shape (Fig. 1). CRCs for PHE were 
compared in the absence and presence of CsA (1 nM/l). In the 

MOLECULAR MEDICINE REPORTS 5: 1469-1474, 2012 1471
presence of CsA, curves were shifted to the left. A similar shift 
of CRC and E/RT curves in the presence of CsA was shown in 
our earlier investigation (stimulated by AVP).
Mobilization of Ca2+ ions from ER of arteries in the absence 
or presence of CsA (1 nM/l). In the performed experiment, the 
contraction of arteries was triggered by PHE (10-5 M/l) and AVP 
(10-5 M/l). Values of pressure changes were presented as the 
means for n=16 ± SD. The experiment was carried out in a fluid 
without Ca2+. The mean value of perfusion pressure, induced 
by PHE and AVP was 60 (±4.3) mmHg and 61 (±4.0) mmHg, 
respectively. During the incubation in the presence of CsA 
(1 nM/l), no significant changes in contraction effect were 
found for PHE and AVP. Perfusion pressure induced by the 
action of the drug in both cases was not significantly different 
compared to the control. Perfusate pressure, after incubation 
in the presence of CsA, was 65 (±3.9) mmHg for PHE and 
67 (±3.9) mmHg for AVP. Reactivity of the arteries during 
the incubation in the presence of CsA was not changed. The 
absence of significant differences in the perfusion pressure 
proves that CsA does not change the mobilization of intracel￾lular fraction of Ca2+ ions (Fig. 2).
Mobilization of Ca2+ ions from extracellular fraction in the 
absence or presence of CsA (1 nM/l). In the performed experi￾ment, the contraction of arteries was triggered by PHE (10-5 M/l) 
and AVP (10-5 M/l). Values of pressure changes were presented 
as the means for n=16 ± SD. The experiment was carried out 
in Ca2+ fluid. The mean value of perfusion pressure induced 
by PHE and AVP was 92 (±6.2) mmHg and 96 (±5.2) mmHg, 
respectively. During the incubation in the presence of CsA 
(1 nM/l), an increase in the contraction effect of PHE was 
observed. Perfusion pressure induced by the action of the drug 
increased to 108 (±4.2) mmHg and was different compared to 
the control (p<0.0001). Increased reactivity of arteries to the 
pressor action of AVP and PHE demonstrates the mobilization 
of Ca2+ ions from the extracellular fraction (Fig. 3).
Changes in perfusion pressure induced by PHE before and 
after application of CsA (1 nM/l) in the presence of nife￾dipine, diltiazem and losartan. In the performed experiment, 
the contraction of arteries was triggered by PHE (10-5 M/l). 
The control values for PHE and PHE and CsA (1 nM/l) were 
92 (±6.2) mmHg and 108 (±4.2) mmHg, respectively. The 
derivative of 1,4-dihydropyridne, nifedipine (3x10-5), success￾fully decreased the perfusion pressure to 87 (±5.3) mHg during 
incubation in the presence of CsA (p<0.0001). A similar result 
was found for the benzotiazepine derivative, diltiazem. The 
mean pressure value after incubation in the presence of CsA 
was 93 (±5.3) mmHg and was 15 mmHg lower than the control 
(p<0.0001). Losartan, an angiotensin receptor antagonist, did 
not reduce artery reactivity in the presence of CsA. The mean 
pressure value for losartan was 106 (±4.3) mmHg and was 
2 mmHg lower than the control (p=0.2614) (Fig. 4).
Changes in perfusion pressure induced by AVP before and 
after application of CsA (1 nM/l) in the presence of nifedipine, 
diltiazem and losartan. In the performed experiment, the 
contraction of arteries was triggered by AVP (10-5 M/l). The 
control values for AVP alone and AVP plus CsA (1 nM/l) 
were 96 (±5.2) mmHg and 116 (±4.8) mmHg, respectively. 
The derivative of 1,4-dihydropyridne, nifedipine, successfully 
decreased the perfusion pressure to 91 (±4.5) mmHg during

incubation in the presence of CsA (p<0.0001). A similar result 
was found for the benzotiazepine derivative, diltiazem. The 
mean pressure value after incubation in the presence of CsA 
was 93 (±5) mmHg and was 23 mmHg lower than the control 
(p<0.0001). Losartan did not reduce artery reactivity in the 
presence of CsA. The mean pressure value for losartan was 
112 (±5.4) mmHg and was 4 mmHg lower than the control 
(p=0.1245) (Fig. 5).
Effect of CsA on vasoconstriction induced by BayK-8644. 
In the performed experiment, vasoconstriction was triggered 
by the calcium channels agonist, BayK-8644. Arteries were 
incubated in the presence of CsA (1 nM/l).
To determine how CsA induces hyperreactivity of arteries, 
two different patterns were made. The first pattern was based 
on a contraction triggered by BayK-8644 in fluid without 
Ca2+. The mean perfusion pressure value for BayK 8644 in 
the presence of CsA was 15 (±4.1) mmHg and was not signifi￾cantly different compared to the control [12 (±3.3) mmHg] 
(p=0.1198).
In the second pattern, the arteries were incubated in a fluid 
with Ca2+. Perfusion pressure induced by BayK-8644 was 
73 (±5.9) mmHg. The incubation of arteries in the presence of 
CsA did not change their reactivity on contraction triggered by 
BayK-8644. The mean perfusion pressure value in this pattern 
was 76 (±3.9) mmHg and was not significantly different 
compared to the control (p=0.2375) (Fig. 6).
Discussion
The reactivity of VSMCs is upregulated through the auto￾nomic nervous system. The tension depends on the hormonal 
activity and local chemical signals. Abnormal vasoreactivity 
caused by endothelial dysfunction or impaired signal trans￾mission, induces the development of hypertension in the group 
of patients treated with CsA (29).
Hyperreactivity is the result of complex mechanisms, which 
lead to the increased concentration of Ca2+ ions in a myocyte. 
However, vasopressin, norepinephrine and endothelin-1 are 
ligands for a number of transmembrane metabotropic recep￾tors. The mechanisms of signal transmission in their area 
are similar and lead to the activation of intracellular calcium 
influx (30). Moreover, there is a possibility that all receptors 
bound with the G-protein and IP3/DAG cascade are involved 
in enhancing vasopressin effect via CsA.
No effect of CsA on the mobilization of the intracellular 
calcium pool suggests that there was a significant increase of 
transmission within the IP3R and ryanodin receptors during 
the exposure of the arteries to the drug (Fig. 2).
Artery incubation in the presence of CsA increased the 
influx of calcium ions from the intracellular fraction (Fig. 3). 
Therefore, the increased intracellular influx from the extracel￾lular compartment may be considered as an important element 
of hypertension pathogenesis.
In our experiments estimating the vessel contractions 
induced with the L-type calcium channel agonist, BayK-8644, 
no significant differences were found in perfusion pressure 
in both fluids (with and without Ca2+) in the presence of CsA 
(Fig. 6).
Contraction induced by BayK-8644 initiates calcium ion 
influx from the extracellular area. Apart from vasoconstriction 
action, BayK-8644 may exert inotropic effects (31). CsA did

not increase the reactivity of arteries on the pressor action of 
BayK-8644. The obtained results demonstrate that the drug 
does not modulate the agonist binding site, and does not change 
the mobilization of the calcium pool from the ER fraction. In 
our study, we observed that, in the presence of CsA, the vaso￾sensitivity of the pressor action of PHE and AVP increased. 
The reason for this hyperreactivity is the enlargement of the 
receptor reserve pool (α1, V1). This was confirmed by the higher 
value of KA/ED50 in both cases. Higher receptor reserve in 
consequence leads to the higher sensitivity of pressure factors 
(32,33). The data available in the literature show the impact of 
CsA on the concentration of GPCR receptors.
It was also proven that CsA at a dose of 25 mg/kg body 
mass/day applied for 4 weeks induced the expression of 
mRNA, which encodes the receptor for endothelin-1 (subtype 
ETA) in the aorta and mesenteric artery by 170 and 176%, 
respectively. This fact shows an important role of endothelin-1 
and its receptor in the pathogenesis of hypertension in a group 
of patients treated with immunosuppressants. The selective 
ETA-FR 139317 receptor antagonist may protect from this 
action (34). We should also emphasize the role of angio￾tensin II, whose concentration increases with long-term use 
(35). Based on our experiments, we conclude that CsA directly 
increases the activity of PKC, dependent of Ca2+. Shin et al
confirmed that the hyperreactivity of PKC (β-isoform) plays 
an important role in the pathogenesis induction, which leads to 
renal fibrosis in patients treated with CsA (36).
Based on the results in the following study, we may consider 
a direct influence of CsA on calcium channels. This is due to 
the reduction or even complete inhibition of vasoconstriction 
effect of the drug in the presence of the calcium antagonist.
Analyzing the costs of hypertension drugs used after 
exposure on CsA, it can be concluded that the effective variant 
in pharmacotherapy of hypertension induced by CsA may 
be calcium channel antagonists (37). Carrier et al showed 
that the application of diltiazem by the infusion effectively 
decreases renal perfusion pressure and may protect from the 
nephrotoxic effects of the drug. However, even after applica￾tion of diltiazem, a significant elevation in the concentration 
of endothelin-1 from 0.5±0.4 to 3.8±0.6 pg/ml in the presence 
of CsA was observed. Although the calcium channel blockade 
by diltiazem effectively reduced the vasoconstrictive action of 
the immunosuppressant, they did not prevent the expression of 
endothelin-1 (38).
The use of the angiotensin receptor antagonist was not 
effective in the hypertension therapy of patients treated with 
CsA (Figs. 4 and 5). Hypertension in transplant recipients 
almost always requires matching three drugs from different 
therapeutic groups. As a diuretic, patients should receive loop 
diuretics. If there are no arbitrary indications (coronary artery 
disease and myocardial infarction), β-blocker application may 
be suspended. Observations from past years have shown that 
β-blockers foster the growth of body mass in patients, which 
increases the risk of T2 diabetes. Calcium antagonists belong to 
a preferable group of drugs in hypertension therapy after trans￾plantation. It has been proven that those medications reduce the 
renal failure triggered by infarction and nephrotoxicity caused 
by calcineurin inhibitors (39). Certain drugs from this group 
inhibit CYP3A4, which causes the retention of CsA in the blood 
and necessity of frequent monitoring of the drug concentration 
(40). The greatest inhibition of CsA metabolism was demon￾strated for verapamil, and lower inhibition was shown for drugs, 
such as diltiazem, nicardypine and amlodipine. Nifedipine, 
nitredipine and isradipne did not affect the metabolism of CsA. 
Calcium channel antagonists belong to the preferable group of 
drugs used in patients with hyperlipidemia, since contrary to 
diuretics and β-blockers, they do not affect the lipid homeostasis 
(41). Unlike many other drugs used chronically, omission of a 
single dose of the third-generation calcium antagonist does not 
cause an increase of blood pressure. Contrary to ACE inhibitors 
and β-blockers, amlodipine does not react with non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs, and can be used with antibiotics and 
anti-diabetic medications. Van der Schaaf et al performed 
experiments in patients with hypertension and kidney trans￾plantation treated with CsA. The particularly beneficial 
effect of amlodipine at improving renal function was demon￾strated. Amlodipine was a better controller of blood pressure 
(ABPM 111±9 mmHg) than lisinopril (ABPM 115±9 mmHg). 
Amlodpine enlarged glomerular filtration rate, effective renal 
plasma flow and decreased renal vascular resistance. These 
parameters did not differ significantly during therapy with 
lisinopril (42). Chanard et al proved its superiority over the 
β-blocker teratolol. Amlodipine decreased the concentration of 
uric acid in the plasma from 483±99 to 431±110 µmol/l, whereas 
tetralol increased it from 450±98 to 476±84 µmol/l (43).
In conclusion, CsA increases vascular reactivity by enhancing 
signal transmission between GPCR and calcium channels. 
The effect of CsA is also significantly inhibited by the calcium 
blockers, nifedipine and diltiazem.
