ABSTRACT
The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT) on serum cytokines, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin 
(NGAL), and prognosis in patients with severe acute kidney injury (AKI) following 
cardiac surgery. A total number of 153 patients with severe AKI following cardiac 
surgery were treated with CRRT. They were divided into the survival and non-survival 
groups. Clinical data from these two groups before and after CRRT were recorded and 
analyzed. It was found that the number of impaired organs, MODS and APACHE II 
scores were significantly higher in the non-survival group than those in the survival 
group before CRRT. After CRRT, MODS and APACHE II scores decreased significantly. 
The post-CRRT levels of serum TNF-α and IL-6 were significantly decreased. After 
CRRT, serum NGAL decreased in the two groups, but the levels were higher in the 
non-survival group than those in the survival group. MODS and APACHE II scores 
could be used to evaluate the severity of AKI in patients after cardiac surgery. CRRT 
is an effective treatment for these patients and high levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and NGAL 
are associated with a poor prognosis in these patients.
INTRODUCTION
Acute kidney injury (AKI) represents a major 
complication of cardiac surgery [1]. There are up to 
50 % of patients undergoing cardiac surgery develop 
AKI and, despite the improvements in post-operative 
management of critically ill patients, cardiac surgery￾associated AKI (CS-AKI) still carries an increased 
risk of death [2, 3]. AKI is the strongest risk factor for 
postoperative mortality, having an odds ratio of 7.9 and 
a mortality in excess of 60% [4]. Therefore, improving 
the outcomes for these patients is an urgent necessity. 
Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), used as 
a “life support technology,” is very effective and carries 
a number of advantages in postoperative management of 
renal insufficiency [5]. 
The scope of CRRT has expanded from a simple 
extension of renal replacement therapy to the treatment 
for multiple organ system support, and it is playing 
an especially unique role in the treatment of critically 
ill patients with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome 
(MODS). CRRT is an effective means of fluid and solute 
management in AKI [6]. The advantages of treating 
patients with severe AKI after cardiac surgery with CRRT 
are as follows: 1) maintaining hemodynamic stability, 
2) removal of inflammatory mediators, 3) improvement 
of immune function, 4) improvement of organ function, 
5) providing fluid balance and nutritional support, 6)

allowing the reduction of the dosage of vasoactive drugs, 
and 7) promoting recovery of renal function [7, 8].
Biomarker for CRRT is a largely un-explored 
area. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) 
has been emerging as a promising biomarker indicating 
nephrotoxic insults [9]. Cytokines and other inflammatory 
mediators can influence pathogenesis of post-surgical 
complications such as septic shock and associated AKI 
and could become biomarkers for CRRT [5]. Monitoring 
the levels of these components may be used in early 
diagnosis, guiding CRRT, measuring progress, and 
predicting prognosis in patients [9]. There are few reports 
documenting the effects of CRRT on serum NGAL and 
cytokines in patients with severe AKI after cardiac surgery.
The objective of the current study is to elucidate 
the relationship between CRRT and the levels of NGAL 
and serum cytokines, and the overall impact on patient 
prognosis. 
RESULTS
CRRT treatment and outcome
A total of 153 patients with severe AKI after cardiac 
surgery were treated with CRRT in the blood purification 
center in our hospital. There were 89 patients in the 
survival group and 64 patients in the non-survival group. 
The mortality rate was 41.8%. In the survival group, the 
renal function of 61 patients recovered after 19-33 days 
of treatment with CRRT. Hemodialysis for 2-4 weeks was 
required by 17 patients after stopping the treatment of 
CRRT. Maintenance dialysis was required by 11 patients. 
In the non-survival group, 7 patients died from heart 
failure, 12 died from gastrointestinal bleeding, 8 died from 
infection, 34 died from multiple organ failure, and 3 died 
from disseminated intravascular coagulation.

Effect of CRRT on hemodynamics, respiratory 
function, and severity of illness
To evaluate the effect of CRRT on these patients, 
acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II 
(APACHE II)and MODS scores were monitored. 
APACHE score is a physiological based classification 
system used to evaluate acute and chronic health status 
(Table 1) [10]. MODS was defined as a cardiovascular 
system dysfunction (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg 
or mean arterial pressure < 70 mmHg), kidney dysfunction 
(urine output < 0.5 ml/kg body weight/hour for one hour, 
despite adequate fluid resuscitation), respiratory system 
dysfunction (ratio of PaO2
 to FiO2
 < 250 in the presence 
of other dysfunctional organs or systems), hematologic 
dysfunction (platelet count < 80.000/mm3
 or decreased by 
50% in the three days preceding enrollment in the absence 
of liver cirrhosis or previously known hematological 
disease), or metabolic dysfunction (unexplained metabolic 
acidosis: pH < 7.30 or base deficit > 5.0 mmol/L in 
association with a plasma lactate level > 1.5 times of the 
upper normal limit) [11]. The APACHE II and MODS 
scores of the non-survival group were significantly higher 
than those of the survival group before CRRT. The mean 
arterial pressure (MAP) and oxygenation index (OI) were 
lower than in the survival group (P < 0.05). After 24 
hours of CRRT treatment, the MAP and OI in both groups 
improved greatly compared with before treatment. The 
MODS score, APACHE II score, and the heart rate (HR) 
of the survival group all decreased significantly (t > 
2.045, P < 0.05) (Table 2). These results indicated that 
CRRT could improve the hemodynamics and respiratory 
function, and relieve the severity of illness.
Effect of CRRT on renal function, WBC, and PLT 
The renal function, WBC and PLT were analyzed 
before and after CRRT. The serum BUN and Cr of the 
non-survival group was significantly higher than those of 
the survival group before treatment (t > 1.984, P < 0.05), 
indicating that patients in the non-survival group had very 
poor renal function that were not benefited from CRRT. 
After the treatment with continuous blood purification 
for 12, 24, and 48 h, the levels of BUN and Cr in these 
two groups were significantly lower than the levels before 
treatment (t > 2.626, P < 0.01). The WBC and PLT count 
in these two groups were not significantly different before 
and after treatment (Figure 1A and 1B). These results 
suggested that CRRT could greatly improve patients’ renal 
function, although it did not affect the number of blood 
cells such as WBC or PLT.
CRRT affects secretion of cytokines
Because cardiac surgery is usually accompanied 
with inflammatory reactions, the changes of inflammatory 
Group A (survival) had 89 cases and Group B (non-survival) had 64 cases. CPB, cardiopulmonary bypass; CRRT, continuous

mediators were evaluated. It was found that serum pro￾inflammatory cytokine TNF-α of the survival group were 
significantly decreased after CRRT treatment (207.3 ± 
75.9 pg/mL vs. 437.6 ± 129.8 pg/mL, P < 0.05). The 
same pattern was seen with IL-6 (165.9 ± 64.7 pg/mL vs. 
350.4 ± 129.3 pg/mL, P < 0.05). These values were not 
significantly reduced in the non-survival group. There was 
no significant change of the anti-inflammatory factor, IL￾10 in these two groups before and after treatment (Figure 
2A-2C).
Effect of CRRT on NAGL in severe AKI
Serum NGAL increased in the first several hours 
in response with CRRT treatment. However, there 
was a consistent trend of decrease in the serum NGAL 
throughout the treatment. The NGAL concentration in the 
ultrafiltration was between 16.9 and 22.7 ng/mL. NGAL 
levels were higher in non-survivors (197.4 ± 60.1 ng/
mL) than those in survivors (107.1 ± 48.2 ng/mL) (P = 
0.039) (Figure 3).

Effect of CRRT on the mortality of severe AKI
The average number of dysfunctional organs in the 
non-survival group was much greater than in the survival 
group (chi-square statistics, χ2 > 6.63, P < 0.01). 
The mortality of patients increased as the number of 
dysfunctional organs increased. After CRRT treatment, the 
survival rate was 84.7% with 2 or 3 dysfunctional organs 
and 16.1% with ≥ 4 dysfunctional organs.
DISCUSSION
The increased incidence of AKI is a known common 
postoperative complication after cardiac surgery [12]. In 
order to predict the morbidity and mortality of patients 
with severe AKI after cardiac surgery accurately, this 
study evaluated the effect of CRRT on the renal function, 
the hemodynamics, the pulmonary function, the cytokines 
and NGAL, combined with the APACHE II and MODS 
scoring system in the survival and the non-survival 
patients. 
The CRRT is a process of slow, isotonic removal of 
water and solute, clearance of inflammatory mediators and 
myocardial depression factors, correction of electrolyte 
and acid-base imbalance, and maintenance of circulatory 
stability. Simultaneously, CRRT removes excessive fluid 
in the lung interstitium to improve lung function, increases 
blood pressure, and reduces carbon dioxide retention. In 
this study, there were 142 patients who required nutritional 
support and a large number of intravenous medications. 
We found that Cr and BUN in patients after CRRT 
treatment were much lower than those without CRRT 
treatment, indicating improvement of renal function. 
CRRT provides stable hemodynamics and was favorable 
for the recovery of renal function [13]. The renal function 
in 74.9% patients in the survival group became normal 
after CRRT. Our results confirmed previous report [6] 
that monocyte and endothelial cell function was improved 
and the ratio of anti-inflammatory to pro-inflammatory 
mediators was regulated, which reduces organ damage in 
patients with severe AKI who were treated with CRRT. 
The OI and MAP of patients treated with CRRT also 
improved from pretreatment levels.
Many studies have shown that levels of serum 
cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-6, are increased in 
patients with severe AKI [14-16]. Pro-inflammatory 
cytokines may contribute to additional organ dysfunction, 
which is associated with high mortality [17]. TNF-α 
had a molecular mass approximately 17 kD, secreted by 
macrophages, mast cells, and natural killer cells, with 
the effect of stimulating the release of proinflammatory 
cytokines and prostaglandin inflammatory mediators 
from macrophages [18]. IL-6 is a 26-kD protein produced 
by the liver, lymphocytes, and activated macrophages. 
It is crucial in the acute-phase inflammatory response 
and is relevant to the inducers of cardiovascular disease 
[19]. CRRT may decrease inflammatory cytokine 
Figure 3: Change of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) level at different time points. Serum NGAL level 
was higher in the non-survival group (197.4 ± 60.1 ng/mL) than those in the survival group (107.1 ± 48.2 ng/mL) (*P = 0.039).

levels for patients with severe AKI [16]. In this study, 
the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 were 
significantly reduced in the survival group compared with 
the non-survival group. A low level of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines is associated with low mortality. While 
the anti-inflammatory cytokineIL-10, did not change 
significantly between the two groups. It is suggested that 
IL-10 may appear before the rise of the anti-inflammatory 
cytokines, and CRRT might have blocked the progress of 
inflammation by decreasing inflammatory cytokines.
NGAL is expressed in a number of human tissues 
including gastrointestinal, respiratory, and urinary tissue 
and increases in response to inflammation [19]. It’s been 
confirmed that NGAL is an early biomarker for kidney 
disease [20, 21]; therefore, NGAL may be considered an 
AKI biomarker in patients receiving CRRT. It had been 
demonstrated that NGAL provided protection against 
renal ischemic/reperfusion injury in animals [22]. In this 
study, NGAL is lower in patients in the survival group 
than that in non-survival group whose concentration in the 
ultrafiltration was 16.9-22.7 ng/mL.
However, the limitation of this study was that it was 
a one single-center analysis. A future multi-center study 
with a larger sample size and a longer follow-up period 
is required.
In summary, high levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and NGAL 
are associated with a poor prognosis in AKI. CRRT is a 
safe and effective treatment for patients with severe AKI 
after cardiac surgery. CRRT has been shown to improve 
the prognosis of patients who are treated in a timely 
manner. However, the optimal timing, dialysis protocol, 
and other aspects of the treatment of AKI with CRRT after 
cardiac surgery have not yet been determined and should 
be studied further.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and clinical characteristics
The study consisted of 153 patients (102 men 
and 51 women) who were in line with the diagnostic 
criteria for AKI following cardiac surgery treated with 
CBP between January 2005 and June 2014. Patients’ age 
ranges from 27 to 79 years (55.04 ± 13.27). Exclusion 
criteria included renal dysfunction before surgery, death 
within 24 hours after CBP and incomplete data. AKI is 
defined as serum Cr level that has doubled from baseline 
or urine output < 0.5 mL∙kg-1∙h-1 for > 12 h [23, 24]. 
MODS was defined according to the criteria adopted 
by the Academic Council for discussion and severity 
of disease staging score standards [11, 25]. Of the 153 
patients, 91 patients had a New York Heart Association 
Functional Classification of III and 57 patients were class 
IV. Patients diagnosed with renal dysfunction before the 
surgery were excluded. Surgical procedures included 23 
cases of mitral valve replacement, 7 cases of aortic valve 
replacement, 14 cases of double valve replacement (aortic 
valve and mitral valve), 37 cases of coronary artery bypass 
grafting, 19 cases of coronary artery bypass grafting and 
valve replacement, 11 cases of double valve replacement 
and tricuspid valvuloplasty, 7 cases of aortic dissection, 
10 cases of cardiac tumor resection, and 23 cases 
involving complex, miscellaneous cardiac surgery. The 
average aortic clamp time was 83.97 ± 50.14 minutes. 
Postoperative vasopressors to maintain blood pressure 
were required in 129 patients, and 113 patients required 
mechanical ventilation. The Human Research Ethics 
Committee at Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital approved 
the study prior to its initiation. The patients and clinical 
characteristics of the survival and non-survival groups 
were summarized in Table 3. 
The CRRT method
Indwelling vascular access, with a double lumen 
catheter approach using a femoral or jugular vein and the 
Seldinger technique, was established in all 153 patients. 
The CRRT equipment used was the Baxter Aquarius/
BM25 (Baxter, USA) and the AV600S hemofiltration 
device using a polysulfone membrane with an area of 
1.4 m2
 (Fresenius, St. Wendel, Germany). A Baxter 
continuous blood purification line was used for continuous 
venovenous hemofiltration. The average replacement 
fluid flow rate was 3000 mL/h with a blood flow of 160-
200 mL/min using low molecular weight heparin as 
anticoagulant. 
Assays on serum cytokine
Serum samples were collected before CRRT (0h), 
and at 4, 8, 24, 48h after the beginning of CRRT and stored 
at -80°C for later cytokine assay. The concentrations of 
interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) 
were measured by ELISA per the manufacturers’ 
directions. IL-6 and TNF-α anti-body were purchased 
from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). 
Sampling and quantification of NGAL
Serum samples for quantification of NGAL were 
obtained from each patient before CRRT (0h), and at 4, 
8, 24, 48 h after the beginning of CRRT. Samples were 
immediately centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 min, divided into 
aliquots, and stored at -80°C. NGAL was measured using a 
commercially available ELISA kit (BioPorto Diagnostics, 
Gentofte, Denmark) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions.

Other clinical indices
All patients were given an APACHE II (acute 
physiology and chronic health evaluation II) and MODS 
score. The changes in heart rate (HR), mean arterial 
pressure (MAP), oxygenation index (PaO2
/FiO2
), white 
blood cell(WBC) count, platelet count (PLT), and renal 
function as indicated by the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 
and creatinine (Cr) were all monitored and recorded 
during the hospital stay. 
Statistical analysis
Analyses were performed using SPSS v.13.0 
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Results are presented 
as mean ± standard deviation. Differences between 
groups were assessed using one-way ANOVA (followed 
by least-significant difference for multiple comparisons). 
Significance was set at P-value < 0.05 (two-tailed).
